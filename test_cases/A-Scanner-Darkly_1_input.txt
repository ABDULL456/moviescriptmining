DAN (O.S.) Open the fucking door! 
KIMBERLY (small voice) No.   I'm with someone. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DAN (O.S.) Fine!   I'll slash your tires! 
Sound of running downstairs. Kimberly rises, and she and Arctor watch out the window as Dan, a skinny, short-haired effeminate-looking guy, appears in the parking lot, crazily waving a knife in the air. 
DAN (screaming up at Kimberly) I'll slash your tires, your fucking tires! And then I'll kill you! 
Dan begins slashing tires on Kimberly's old Dodge. This seems to wake Kimberly up. She shrieks, runs to the door and frantically begins unlocking it. 
KIMBERLY I got to stop him! I don't have insurance! 
Arctor grabs her, tries to hold her back. 
BOB ARCTOR Tires aren't... 
KIMBERLY (struggling to get free) My tires! 
BOB ARCTOR That's what he wants you to do. 
KIMBERLY Downstairs.   They have a phone!   Let me go! 
Kimberly fights loose of Arctor with manic energy. 
KIMBERLY (CONT'D) (unlocking the door) I'm calling the police. My tires! (out the door) One of them is new! 
INT. APARTMENT HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Kimberly is scrambling down the stairs. She arrives at an apartment door and pounds on it. Arctor is right behind her. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
KIMBERLY Open, please? Please? I need to call the police. Please let me call them. 
The door opens. An old man in tie and sweater stands there. Kimberly hurries past him, goes for the phone, and dials. 
BOB ARCTOR (to old man) Thank you. 
INT. OLD PEOPLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS 
Arctor enters, closes the door and watches out the peephole. 
KIMBERLY (on phone, crazily) Hi, yeah, my boyfriend and me got into a fight because of these cowboy boots which were worth seven dollars. See, I said, they're mine, and he says, no, they're mine 'cause you gave them to me as a present. And I say but I bought them. Which makes them mine. Right? So he grabs 'em and I grab 'em, and I rip the backs of them with this can opener and... yes, I'll hold. 
Arctor glances at the old man, who's been quietly studying him. An old woman in a print dress stands in the dining room doorway. Kimberly paces on hold, chews a fingernail. 
ARCTOR (to old man) This must be bad on you. 
OLD MAN It goes on all the time, them fighting, him saying he'll kill her. 
OLD WOMAN We should have gone back to Denver.   I told you that. 
OLD MAN These terrible fights. On and on. Smashing things and screaming. And what's worse, every time -- 
OLD WOMAN Yes, tell him about that. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
OLD MAN Every time we go out, shopping or to mail a letter, we step in... what dogs leave. 
OLD WOMAN (whispering) Dog doo. 
INT. ARCTOR'S CAR - DAY 
Arctor drives on the freeway, deep in thought. Luckman's next to him. Barris is in back grinning in his dark shades. 
BOB ARCTOR (V.O.) Dog shit. All that misery and that's what really upset them. 
Arctor chuckles.   The car is behind a crawling Safeway truck. 
ERNIE LUCKMAN You ought to pass that truck, man. The humper's hardly moving. 
Arctor comes back into focus, picks up speed, passes the truck on the left. As he eases up on the gas, the pedal falls to the floor. The car shoots forward at great speed. 
LUCKMAN AND BARRIS Slow down! 
Arctor is panicked. The speedometer is registering eighty- five, ninety, one hundred. Arctor reaches down, tries to fiddle with the gas peddle. The car is rocketing right for a VW van chugging along. Barris and Luckman throw up their hands. Arctor swerves to the left of the van at the last minute. They pass it, but a fast moving Corvette had been about to pass in that lane. It honks, its brakes screech. 
LUCKMAN AND BARRIS (CONT'D) (top of their lungs) What the fuck?! What are you doing?! 
Luckman grabs at the ignition key, and turns it off. Arctor shifts into neutral, the car begins to slow, and he maneuvers it onto the shoulder. The Corvette shoots by, lays on it's horn, continues to do so until it's long gone down the freeway. The three guys just sit in the car, hearts pounding. The VW van passes and honks its VW horn. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JIM BARRIS What the hell happened, Bob? 
They all look down at the still-depressed gas pedal.     The Safeway truck passes and sounds its own basso horn.

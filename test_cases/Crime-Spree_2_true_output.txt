BIKER No. 
RAYMOND But the music is very-- 
Before Raymond can finish his sentence the Biker pours his beer over Raymond's head. 
BIKER Fuck off! 
He slams the door in Raymond's face. 
INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON 
The music continues to pound through the walls. A soggy Raymond steps into the room. He walks over to a chair and sits down, his head hung down, embarrassed. Marcel is angered by this. He glances over to Daniel who subtly nods to him. Marcel leaves the room. 
EXT. SIDE OF WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON 
Marcel walks purposefully along the side of the building. He reaches into his jacket pocket and removes two black leather gloves. He slips them on as he approaches the door, then knocks. A beat. The Biker opens the door. 
BIKER Listen asshole, I told you -- 
Marcel head butts him, slamming his forehead into the bridge of his nose. The Biker clasps his hands over his bleeding nose. Marcel grabs him by the hair and rapidly punches him in face several times -- each punch backing the Biker into the room. 
INT. BIKER'S WAREHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS 
On the last punch the Biker falls backwards crashing through a large glass coffee table. 
BIKER #2 moves in behind Marcel and throws a hard punch as Marcel turns around. Marcel bends his head down, so that his attackers fists slams into the hard crown of his skull. 
BIKER #2 painfully grabs his broken knuckles. Marcel knees him hard in the groin. BIKER #2 turns to his side and doubles over. Marcel kicks the man into the back of his knee spinning him around and down on his knees. 
In a fluid movement he elbows the man in the back of head . BIKER #2 falls face forwards and is out cold. Marcel turns to the third BIKER who is standing by the stereo. He is smaller than the others and has seen enough. He quickly turns off the power. DEAD QUIET. 
INT. SOPHIE'S WAREHOUSE -- MOMENTS LATER -- AFTERNOON 
Marcel enters.   Wayne is on the couch with Raymond. 
WAYNE (impressed) What'd you say to them? 
MARCEL (dryly) Nothing. 
EXT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB -- AFTERNOON 
A plain looking building in an old neighborhood of the city. 
INT. SOUTH SIDE SOCIAL CLUB - ZAMMITO'S OFFICE -- AFTERNOON 
Zammito sits at his desk. Joey "Two Tons" and Nicky "The Rake" sit on the couch. Bobby Beans balding, stocky enters. 
ZAMMITO Hey, Bobby beans... How you doin'? 
He walks up to Zammito and they kiss each other on the cheek. 
BOBBY BEANS Good. I'm doing good. How you doin', Frankie? 
ZAMMITO Good.   I'm good. 
BOBBY BEANS Mr. Maranzano sends his warmest regards. 
ZAMMITO When you return please extend my regards to Mr. Maranzano and his family. 
Zammito motions for Bobby to sit down. 
ZAMMITO Can I offer you something.    A drink? Coffee? 
BOBBY BEANS No thank you. 
ZAMMITO You sure? I just got a shipment of espresso from Sicily. Special blend. Can't find anything like it in the States. 
BOBBY BEANS I'm good.   Really. 
ZAMMITO Okay. I understand you're interested in one of our properties? 
BOBBY BEANS Yeah. That warehouse over on Merchant Street. The volume on our import business has risen dramatically. The proceeds this quarter will be supernumerary due to the -- 
ZAMMITO (overlapping) -- Super what? 
BOBBY BEANS Supernumerary. It means better than expected. 
ZAMMITO Then why not just fuckin' say better than expected? Everybody knows what better than expected means. 
BOBBY BEANS I'm taking a vocabulary course to enhance my communication skills. 
ZAMMITO Okay.   How much? 
BOBBY BEANS I'm not here to negotiate. 
ZAMMITO Why are you here?

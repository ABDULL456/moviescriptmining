ARCHIVE TELEVISION FOOTAGE 
It's Election Day 1997. Up and down the country, the PEOPLE OF BRITAIN, people of all shapes and sizes and denominations, black and white, young and old, are going to the Polls. 
Everyone, that is, except the people that live in... 
EXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY 
The most instantly recognisable Palace in the world. 
The Royal Standard, (the flag of heraldic lions and symbolic harp-strings that signals the Monarch's presence), flutters on the roof. 
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - CHINESE ROOM DAY 
We're in a state room at Buckingham Palace. A TV plays in the corner.. 
COMMENTARY ..here's Tony Blair, just 43 years old, arriving at the polling station of his constituency in Sedgefield.." 
QUEEN ELIZABETH II, wearing formal robes of the Garter, is posing for an official portrait by an elderly black PORTRAIT ARTIST, (representative, one assumes, of one of the many Charities of which she is patron).. 
ELIZABETH Have you voted yet, Mr Crawford? 
ARTIST 
(proudly dabbing palette) Yes, Ma'am. I was there when they opened. First in line. Seven o'clock. 
COMMENTARY 
If he wins, he'll be the youngest Prime Minister in almost two hundred years.." 
He straightens.. 
ARTIST And I don't mind telling you, it wasn't for Mr Blair. 
ELIZABETH Not a moderniser, then? 
ARTIST Certainly not. We're in danger of losing too much that's good about this country as it is. 
TV COMMENTARY "The only questions that still remain: how big will his landslide be? And how extensive, how sweeping will the modernisation programme be that he ushers in?" 
ELIZABETH Hmm. 
The QUEEN watches as he paints.. 
ELIZABETH I rather envy you being able to vote. (a beat) Not the actual ticking of the box, although, I suppose, it would be nice to experience that ONCE. (a beat) But the sheer joy of being partial. 
ARTIST Yes.. 
The ARTIST squints as he scrutinises the canvass.. 
ARTIST One forgets that as Sovereign, you are not entitled to vote. 
ELIZABETH No. 
ARTIST Still, you won't catch me feeling sorry for you. You might not be allowed to vote, Ma'am.. (a beat) But it IS your Government. 
ELIZABETH Yes. 
The QUEEN raises her eyebrow.. 
ELIZABETH I suppose that is some consolation. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
INT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE - QUEEN'S BEDROOM - DAY 
The QUEEN's face. Fast asleep. It's shortly before 8.00 am. Daylight filters through the curtains. As does something else..

INDIANA What -- the bug? 
Willie is petrified and shaking. 
WILLIE Get -- the -- bug -- off! 
INDIANA Gee, I wouldn't want to touch an ugly critter like that! 
SHORT ROUND (grinning) Uh uh -- me neither! 
Willie looks at the man-of-action like he's insane.  Then she feels the bug crawling onto her cheek -- 
WILLIE Oh no -- oh no!! 
INDIANA (studying the bug) You know, Willie, I'll bet he's mad because they were eating his friends for dinner. 
WILLIE Please -- oh please, I'm going to die!  Get it off! 
Indiana shrugs and leans over and casually swats the horrible bug off her face.  He and Short Round watch the insect skid across the floor -- and suddenly disappear as if by magic! 
Puzzled, they wander toward the wall, leaving Willie behind, bathed in sweat, staring at the ceiling -- 
WILLIE What did I do to deserve this trip?! 
Kneeling by the wall, Short Round examines the baseboard -- 
SHORT ROUND It went under.  Hey, I feel wind, Indy. 
Indiana knocks on the wall and considers the hollow sound.  He moves back and looks at the whole wall.  Behind him, Willie moves past -- 
WILLIE I'm packing!  I'm getting out of here right now tonight! 
She dashes behind a screen to start getting dressed.  Meanwhile Indy feels the marble walls.  He moves to a niche in which there is a small statue of Ganesha, the friendly elephant god. 
Indiana lifts the statue -- and a panel in the wall opens slow- ly.  Short Round looks amazed.  Indy watches the light fall across the far wall of a tunnel as the door opens slowly. 
Indy peers into the tunnel at an old wall painting.  Spiderly San- skrit calligraphy runs under a flanking illustration of a prince bowing before a god. 
INDIANA *(He reads aloud an inscription in Sanskrit). 
SHORT ROUND What does it mean, Indy? 
INDIANA (translating) "Follow in the footsteps of Shiva.  Do not betray his truth." 
Indy takes out the piece of cloth the boy gave him in Mayapore, the similarities are striking.  It is also a picture of Shiva Sankara. 
INDIANA *(He repeats aloud the inscrip- tion also written on the cloth) 
Over behind the screen, Willie's getting into some silk pants with an Indian-style brocade bodice top -- 
WILLIE I don't care if I have to walk to Delhi, I'm -- hey! 
She notices Indy and Short Round bending to enter the dark tunnel behind the wall. 
WILLIE (Cont'd) Wait a minute!  What're you -- where're you going?! 
Indy pokes his head back into the room -- 
INDIANA Lock your door and don't leave until we get back. 
He disappears behind the wall and Willie looks worried. 
75.    INT.  A PALACE TUNNEL - NIGHT                                  75. 
Indy and Short Round enter the secret passage and move forward slowly into the inky darkness. 
SHORT ROUND I don't think we suppose to be in here, Indy... 
They creep slowly down the dark tunnel.  It grows smaller and Indy ducks his head. 
SHORT ROUND (Cont'd) I step on something. 
Their footsteps crunch on the tunnel floor. 
INDIANA You're right, there's something all over the floor... 
Even Short Round has to duck and Indy finally kneels to his hands and knees. 
INDIANA (Cont'd) We'll have to crawl. 
As they crawl, their hands and knees continue to crunch on what- ever it is littering the ground. 
SHORT ROUND Indy, the floor -- there is some- thing alive! 
Indiana gets a match out of his pocket.  He snaps it with his thumb and the match flares -- a hideous insectarium: a living collection of the world's ugliest antropods, hexapods and arch- nids. 
SHORT ROUND Holy smoke -- I'm scared, Indy! 
Indiana turns and sees something else -- 
INDIANA There's a chamber here.  Come on -- 
Indy finds an oil lamp on the wall and lights it.  Short Round happily scampers into the chamber and Indy follows him.  Suddenly the door slides shut -- trapping them inside!

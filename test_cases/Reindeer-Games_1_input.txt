INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL 
Merlin reaches Rudy's door. Searches his pockets for the key. 
EXT. PARKING LOT 
Rudy darts to the front of the Blazer, slipping and sliding on asphalt ice. He drops to his knees, pushing on the front bumper. 
The wheels start to move. 
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL 
Merlin finds a room key. Puts it in the lock. Turns the handle but the door won't open. Merlin checks the key. 
MERLIN My room. 
EXT. PARKING LOT 
The Blazer starts to roll backwards, toward the snowy shrubs ringing the building. Headed for the empty parking space below Rudy's window. Rudy keeps pushing. The Blazer picks up speed, rolling on its own. 
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL 
Merlin searches his pockets again, finds the right key. 
EXT. PARKING LOT 
The Blazer rolls toward the building. Rudy scrambles to his feet, runs after it, leaps his left foot onto the bumper, the right foot onto the hood, then onto the roof -- 
-- getting two roof-steps worth of running start -- 
-- as the Blazer slows to a rest against the snowy shrubs -- 
-- and Rudy dives into the air, torpedoing himself right through the window to his room -- 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM 
-- where he crashes headlong to the floor, turning a somersault and landing sprawled across the carpet. 
INT. SECOND FLOOR HALL 
The key in the lock, Merlin hears the crash -- 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM 
-- and as Merlin opens the door, he finds Rudy sitting calmly on the floor, ankle-cuff locked once again to the bedframe. Spreading a deck of cards out before him. 
Starting a game of solitaire. He looks up. 
RUDY Hey. 
Merlin frowns, takes a suspicious look around the room. The window's open. Rudy continues his card game. 
Merlin watches him for a long time. Then pulls the door shut. 
Once he's gone, Rudy collapses to the floor. Breathing hard, heart pounding. The cards go flying. 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
The LIGHTS go out. Rudy creeps back to the window, checks outside... and stops still. In parking lot... 
...a cigarette glow burns inside the Nova. From the driver's seat. It's Merlin. Now watching. 
Rudy steps back into the shadows. Closing window and watches the falling snow. Caged again, after all. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. RUDY'S ROOM - NIGHT - LATER 
Pitch dark. Rudy asleep on the floor, as Ashley creeps back in. 
Seeing he's asleep, she lies beside him, pulls a blanket over them both, nestles into his body and kisses him. 
ASHLEY Merry Christmas-Eve, my love. My love, my love. Merry Christmas-Eve... 
Ashley closes her eyes. With a smile. 
A moment later, Rudy's eyes open. Turning to look at her smiling, sleeping face... with a convict's vengeful stare... 
INT. KNIGHTS INN LOBBY - DAY 
CLOSE ON DESK CLERK 
In a elfin cap, smiling cheerfully: 
SMILING DESK CLERK Hello, gentlemen. And how can we help you on this holiday morning? 
CLOSE ON GABRIEL, MERLIN AND PUG 
Three grim faces. 
GABRIEL Checking out. 
EXT. KNIGHTS INN PARKING LOT - DAY 
The three truckers stride to the Nova, where Jumpy guards Rudy and Ashley. In the b.g., the Ice Fishermen are by their car, wondering how the hell it switched parking spaces overnight. 
Gabriel marches straight to Rudy and SLUGS him in the gut. Rudy hits the snow -- 
ASHLEY Gabriel! 
GABRIEL That's for the hundred bucks worth of pay-per-view. (then KICKS him) And that's for the two hundred you took outta your minibar.

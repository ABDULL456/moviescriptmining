LYN CASSADY I don't have Crohns. 
BOB What's the matter with you? 
LYN CASSADY I'm dying. Bob stares at him, stunned. 
LYN CASSADY (CONT'D) I've been murdered. 
130   EXT. DESERT - NIGHT                                      130 
Lyn sits staring up at the immense MOON above them. Bob sits watching, huddled against the cold, in the shelter of some rocks. Lyn gets up, stumbles back over to him and lies down, struggling for breath, white with pain. 
LYN CASSADY It's gone Bob. I can't find him. I've lost my power. It's the curse. 
BOB What curse? 
LYN CASSADY (With profound 
SADNESS) They took this... beautiful thing we'd been building and they corrupted it. They destroyed the New Earth Army. 
(CONTINUED) 
130   CONTINUED:                                                130 
BOB Who destroyed it? Lyn stares at the stars above, remembering, grief stricken. 
LYN CASSADY I did. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
131   INT. EX-MESS HALL - FORT BRAGG - DAY - THE PAST           131 
The Jedis, now indistinguishable from other soldiers, stand white-washing over the COSMIC MURALS. Major Holtz stands watching. 
MAJOR HOLTZ Yoga is not the business of the US Army, ladies. Drumming circles are not the business of the Army. And love and peace is most certainly not the business of the Army. So you girls better start thinking about how you CAN engage in the business of the United States Army, which, in case you have forgotten, involves winning fucking wars! 
BOB (V.O.) When the dust of the Pendleton Affair had settled it revealed a surprising victor. 
132   INT. MAJOR HOLTZ'S OFFICE - DAY - THE PAST                132 
Larry stands to attention in front of Holtz, a REPORT held under one arm. 
BOB (V.O.) Major Holtz regarded Larry Hooper as a patriotic whistle-blower and the one sound fruit in an otherwise dubious barrel of apples. 
LARRY HOOPER It's some scientific research I've done for possible offensive psi applications sir. (Beat) I did show the report to Lieutenant Colonel Django, but he didn't seem interested. Holtz snorts angrily. 
(CONTINUED) 
132   CONTINUED:                                                 132 
MAJOR HOLTZ 
(MUTTERING) I bet he wasn't. He takes the report and begins to look through it. Pause. He looks up slowly at Larry. 
MAJOR HOLTZ (CONT'D) We have men who can do this? 
LARRY HOOPER (a sly smile) I think I know one sir. Holtz ponders the report, tempted. 
MAJOR HOLTZ But we don't have the resources. 
LARRY HOOPER Well sir...there is goat lab? 
133   INT. ABANDONED HOSPITAL - DAY - THE PAST                   133 
The building we saw at the top of the film. A hundred GOATS stare silently at us. 
BOB (V.O.) Goat Lab was originally created as a clandestine laboratory to provide in-the-field surgical training for Special Forces soldiers. We BOOM down to reveal that many of the goats have their legs in PLASTER. 
BOB (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) The goats would get shot in the leg with a bolt gun and then a trainee would have to dress the wound successfully. Goat lab actually used to be called Dog Lab... 
134   SMALL DOG STARING AT US                                    134 ...with big, brown eyes. 
BOB (V.O.) But it turned out most soldiers didn't feel good shooting dogs in the leg... A SOLDIER stares doubtfully down at the dog, bolt-gun in hand.

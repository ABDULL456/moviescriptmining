JOE Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate. 
MONICA (horrified) I'm sorry. 
SALLY (raging) There's a goddamn sign on the gate. 
MONICA I'm so sorry. 
SALLY You fucking cow, can't you read?! 
MONICA (at a loss) I... 
SALLY How long ago was it? 
JOE Stop being such a bitch, Sal. 
MONICA I'm so sorry. 
JOE It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis. 
SALLY Don't be so sure. 
JOE Listen to yourself... (to Monica) Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him. (to Sally) What's wrong with you? 
SALLY (re: Monica) She left the fucking gate open. 
JOE Well he can't have gone far. 
SALLY Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away. 
JOE He'll find his way back. 
SALLY There are fucking coyotes out there. 
JOE (calming) Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical. 
Monica retreats, backs off a step or two. 
SALLY Fuck you. 
JOE Or shitty!!  Otis!! 
CUT TO: 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
America and Rosa are cleaning up.  Ryan hangs around chatting. 
RYAN How long have you worked for the Therrians? 
AMERICA (shrugs, polite but annoyed) A long time. 
RYAN So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence? 
AMERICA Oh yes. 
RYAN Did you know the contractor? 
AMERICA Very well. 
RYAN Was it a contractor? 
AMERICA It's the way they do things. 
RYAN To code? 
Her back is to him.  She exchanges a glance with Rosa, and the Spanish equivalent of "who is this wanker?" 
RYAN (CONT'D) Did you see permits?  Did he have a license? 
AMERICA You should talk to Mr. Joe. 
Monica bursts into the room. 
MONICA Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog.

MUMBLE (CONT'D) OK. I'm awake now. You got me 
He looks around - an unfamiliar landscape of ice - then over the side, seeing nothing but slowly spreading ripples. 
A more VIOLENT NUDGE from behind almost makes him lose his balance. A DARK SHAPE passes swiftly through the water. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) Saw you. Richard? Eddie? Ella.... 
The dark shape SHOOTS out of the water. Its GAPING JAWS missing Mumble by an inch. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) ......aaarghH! 
As he recoils, slips and tumbles into the WATER. 
UNDERWATER/ SURFACE 
Choking, thrashing and gulping air, Mumble SCRAMBLES to get back onto the ice. 
MUMBLE Everybody out!! LEOPARD SEAL!! (glub) 
The murderous creature comes at him, jaws open, baring rows of sharp TEETH and MUMBLE swims for his life. 
The LEOPARD SEAL is relentless, barging through smaller floes, powering around larger ones. 
Mumble just CAN'T SHAKE HIM OFF. Desperate, he shoots up into the air, landing on a THIN PANCAKE OF ICE that cannot support his weight. 
MUMBLE (CONT'D) HEEEELP!! 
Mumble scrambles to gain purchase but FALLS BACK INTO THE WATER. Now he is ... 
UNDER THE ICE SHELF 
...caught between the SOLID ICE above him and the bottomless black WATER below. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Mumble POWERS ahead, the ice above growing thicker, the angled ceiling forcing him down, deeper into the BLACKNESS. 
The Leopard Seal opens its mouth. Its GAPING JAWS are about to engulf Mumble when... 
a little SPECK OF LIGHT appears in the ceiling of ice. Mumble makes a speedy sharp turn, climbing steeply. 
He is in a FUNNEL OF ICE...getting narrower and narrower as it rises to the surface. The Leopard Seal is CLOSING fast. MUMBLE shoots THROUGH the hole in the ice and into the air... 
THE ICE-SHELF 
A small group of ADELIE PENGUINS recoil as MUMBLE explodes out of the hole, closely followed by the LEOPARD SEAL. 
WHAM! THUMP! They belly-flop on the ice . 
THE ADELIES (wincing) ...Ouch! ...That's gotta hurt! ...Who ordered seal? 
Mumble is quickly on his feet and out of the Leopard Seal's reach. The ADELIES TAUNT the bulky creature like matadors 
THE ADELIES (CONT'D) ...Over here ...No over here. Too slow! ...have to lose some weight pesado 
The frustrated Leopard Seal snaps and snarls impotently. 
MUMBLE Yeah go chase someone your own size, ya big.......blubberhead. 
Taunting it with a cheeky little TAP DANCE. The Adelies love it. 
AN ADELIE Hey, amigo. Do that again! 
MUMBLE Do what? (defensive) I didn't do anything.

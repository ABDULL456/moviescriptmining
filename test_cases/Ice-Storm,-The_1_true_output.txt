BEN Hey Jim, next time you've got to fill me in on whatever it is you're up to these days. 
JIM Will do. 
INT. STAIRWAY. NIGHT 
At the top of the stairs, a rather dejected Sandy and Mikey finish spying on the leave-takings below. Mikey nudges Sandy, and they silently head back the upstairs hall. 
INT. MIKE'S ROOM. NIGHT 
They enter Mike's room -- the door has a "nuclear waste positively no admittance" sign on it. 
As Mikey reaches his bed, he doubles over, groaning, and starts to make retching noises. He then throws himself onto the bed, his head leaning over the far side. 
Sandy walks over and sees a pile of vomit next to the bed. Taken aback for a moment, he then reaches forward and picks it up -- it's fake plastic vomit. He throws it on top of Mike's back, but Mikey doesn't take notice. 
SANDY Stupid! (pause, looking sullenly at Mike's back) Is Wendy Hood your girlfriend? 
MIKEY (not looking up, but alarmed) Who said so? 
SANDY No one. 
MIKEY I don't have a girlfriend. 
Mikey returns to his reading -- a copy of The Sensuous Woman, obviously well pawed over. He absentmindedly picks his nose. As he flips the pages, a beautiful, almost electrical HUMMING SOUND begins to fill his ears. He frowns and pauses to listen to it. 
Sandy, who has picked up a balsa wood miniature plane, obviously doesn't hear it. 
Mikey focuses on the plane as Sandy waves it through the air. Perhaps the hum is the sound of its engines as it soars through the sky... 
INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
There is a large poster of a cartoon version of Richard Nixon "Tricky Dick" -- on her wall. Wendy is on the phone to her friend Beth. 
WENDY -- he knows that when the March 24th tape -- you know with Dean, where Dean tells him that there's a cancer growing on the presidency -- 
She pauses as Beth asks a question. 
WENDY (CONT'D) Who? No way. He's like a big infected whitehead wearing jeans. I wouldn't -- 
She hears the downstairs door open. 
WENDY (CONT'D) (whispering) -- shit, it's my parents. 
She turns her light out. 
INT. HOOD UPSTAIRS HALLWAY. NIGHT 
Ben and Elena walking past Wendy's room to their bedroom. 
BEN You'd think she'd learn how to cook a chicken, eh? My drumstick was still frozen when you cut inside there. I'm probably going to get whatever that disease -- and Jim, how that guy ever became a millionaire -- 
He pauses before a hall table, and, with his eyes, traces the telephone cord under Wendy's room. 
BEN (CONT'D) Hmm. I knew she'd still be up. Watch this -- 
But Elena simply continues into the master bedroom. 
He starts to pull gently on the cord. And continues pulling. No response for a few seconds. Then: 
CONTINUED: 25 
WENDY (O.S.) (yelling behind her door) Dad stop it! 
BEN Get to sleep young lady -- and I mean it. 
Wendy opens the door to her room. 
WENDY Fascist! 
BEN If I were a fascist I would have sent you to one of those Southern military academies a long time ago. Now get to bed. 
She slams the door. 
He opens it. 
INT. WENDY'S BEDROOM. NIGHT 
Ben enters the room, angry.

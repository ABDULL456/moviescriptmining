Tyrone laughs as Alex shakes his head, not happy. 
INT. RED MAPLE - HOSTESS STAND 
Gigi enters slowly, looking around, searching for Conor. 
She tries to move toward the bar as she's met by Kelli Ann, who grabs a few menus and slaps on a smile. 
KELLI ANN Are you joining us for dinner or - 
GIGI I'm meeting someone.       A guy. 
KELLI ANN Ugh.    Why? 
GIGI Hmmmm? 
KELLI ANN Nothing.   Sorry. For dinner? 
Gigi continues to scan the place, not paying attention. 
GIGI I'm meeting someone. 
KELLI ANN I believe you mentioned that. 
Gigi finishes her visual tour of the room - no Conor. 
GIGI I'm gonna wait at the bar. 
KELLI ANN That's a great idea. 
Gigi walks off.    Kelli Ann takes her place behind the hostess stand. 
AT THE BAR 
Gigi grabs a stool with a good view of the door.     Alex, now behind the bar, approaches. 
ALEX What can I get you? 
GIGI Oh, that's OK. I'm meeting someone. 
Alex takes her in.       She's clearly nervous. 
ALEX Oh, yeah?    Got a hot date? 
GIGI I don't know if you'd call it hot -- I mean this guy Conor and I have only been out the one time so -- 
ALEX Wait - Conor Barry? 
Gigi is busted. 
GIGI Oh, uhh, yeah -- 
ALEX Conor's not coming in tonight. Did he forget he was supposed to meet you? 
GIGI See when I said "meeting someone" I guess that was kind of a broad term, kind of a wide interpretation of the word "meeting"- 
ALEX Because I could just call him -- 
Alex reaches for the phone. 
GIGI NO! I mean, totally unnecessary. I mean, I actually was just - in the area - so I figured I'd just swing by and see if he was around - because - uhhh --- 
Alex waits, looking at Gigi, amused.    She is panicking. 
GIGI (CONT'D) I uhh, had to return his -- 
Gigi frantically searches her coat pockets - searching for something, anything - and finally fishes out A PEN. She looks at it - and decides to go with it. 
GIGI (CONT'D) Pen. I had to return this - pen. He left this. So, I thought I should really return it before he - you know - (conspiratorially to Alex) -- freaks out. 
Alex looks at her skeptically.   And then takes the PEN, and inspects it. 
ALEX Dr. Frankel - Adult, Child and Geriatric Dentistry. 
GIGI Look, I'm not gonna judge about what may or may not be important to someone. 
ALEX That's not even his dentist. 
GIGI Oh, really?   Then who's his dentist? 
ALEX My dad. 
Gigi looks at Alex for a long moment, and finally folds. 
GIGI I'm Gigi. Conor and I went out last week. And I just...I thought if I ran into him...I don't know. I'm gonna go. 
Gigi struggles to get out quickly. Alex looks at her - holding her pen, looking quite frazzled - and softens. 
ALEX Hey. Just - hang out for a second. Lemme buy you a drink. 
Gigi SMILES and sits back down.

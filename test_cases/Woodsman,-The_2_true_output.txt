LUCAS You walked home. 
WALTER Yes. 
Lucas spits his gum into the garbage can and sits down across from Walter. 
LUCAS Some of these guys... They walk right into a family's home as if they live there. Very fucking ballsy. 
Walter is silent. 
LUCAS (cont'd) This one guy on death row, who I'll call Henry, told me about his last victim. Henry says how he's in the bedroom of a seven-year-old cutie named Adele. Her mother's in the living room watching TV. She's got the volume on so damn high he can hear David Letterman's jokes. Henry puts his hand over Adele's mouth and says, "If you scream, little girl, I'll kill your mother." And of course little Adele doesn't scream, doesn't cry, doesn't make a sound. Then he takes her hand and out they go through the front door. pause) Ten days later they find Adele's body. Or what's left of it. (looks at Walter) You believe in fairy tales? 
WALTER Fairy tales? 
LUCAS Do you believe in them?

WALTER No. 
LUCAS Neither do I. (pause) What's the one with the woodsman? 
WALTER Woodsman? 
LUCAS The one with the ax? 
WALTER I don't know. 
LUCAS Sure you do. He cuts open the wolf's stomach, and the girl steps out alive. 
WALTER Little Red Riding Hood. 
LUCAS That's it. Little Red Riding Hood jumps out of the wolf's guts with hardly a scratch. (pause) Ever see a seven-year-old girl sodomized almost in half? 
Walter shakes his head. 
LUCAS (cont'd) She looked so small and broken. I saw hardened twenty-year veterans cry. They cried like babies. I was there. Ain't no fucking woodsman in this world. 
Lucas takes out a fresh piece of gum and pops it in his mouth. Then he rises.

WALTER You knew her? 
LUCAS What? 
WALTER The girl. 
Lucas stares coldly at Walter, his face red. He looks dangerous. 
LUCAS (seething) I don't know why they keep letting scum like you return to the streets. It just means we've got to catch you all over again. 
He slaps Walter on the back of the head... 
LUCAS (cont'd) See ya, Walter. 
... and exits. 
Walter rushes to the blinds, drawing them down, then scrambles to get his journal from the drawer. He drops to his knees, tearing the pages from his journal, tearing them to bits. 
WALTER You have no right to talk to... to speak like... I am not!... I am not! 
The SOUND of children fades in, and Walter looks up. 
In the bedroom doorway is the girl in her white nightgown, sitting on the red ball, rocking back and forth, her chin in her hands. 
IRL Wallie, what are you doing?

Walter squeezes his eyes shut and clamps his hands over his ears. The sound abruptly stops. 
INT. BUS - MORNING 
Walter rides the bus. He is unshaven and looks exhausted. He is jostled by the crowds but seems oblivious. 
INT. WAREHOUSE - MORNING 
As Walter walks into the warehouse, men step out of the way and give him leering looks. Walter walks into -- I

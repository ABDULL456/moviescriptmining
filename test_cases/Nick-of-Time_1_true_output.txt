INT. SERVICE HALL - DAY - 1:17PM 
HUEY and GENE move down a drab service corridor. Boxes stacked on both sides, floor buffers at rest, shelves with cleaning supplies. GENE notices for the first time that HUEY has a pronounced limp. 
They come upon IRENE the Cleaning Woman. She joins them moving down the corridor. 
HUEY Meet Irene. 
GENE Hi. 
HUEY Irene is going to help. 
GENE Thank you. 
IRENE takes GENE's hand and leads him along at a half-trot. 
GENE Where am I going?

They come through a short corridor and onto the service elevator. 
HUEY You said there was only one person you knew wasn't in on this thing. 
GENE Yeah. 
HUEY You're going to go see her. 
GENE What!? 
The elevator doors close. 
INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - DAT - 1:17PM 
IRENE punches the button for the twenty-fifth floor. 
HUEY You sure she's asleep? 
IRENE I took up extra pillows. She take a nap before her big speech. 
GENE What am I supposed to say to her? 
HUEY It'll come to you. See if you can stop this thing 'fore it gets started. Save us all considerable embarrassment. 
HUEY takes a pillow and a blanket from IRENE'S cart and puts it into GENE's arms IRENE You don't have to save me. I got nothin' to do with it. You ain't gettin' no key from me. 
HUEY (shocked) Irene...? 
The service elevator stops. IRENE pushes her cart out into the hall signalling them to stay put for a second. She starts moving out into the hall, the card key falls on the floor.

At the other end of the hall the HALL OFFICER turns when he hears her approach.

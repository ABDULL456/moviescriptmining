Miles's Saab chugs up the ramp and merges. 
INSERT - NEW YORK TIMES CROSSWORD PUZZLE -- 
-- pressed against the STEERING WHEEL. The puzzle is about 1/3 finished. 
EXT. 5 FREEWAY - DAY 
As though from an adjacent car, we see Miles driving while carefully filling in an answer. 
INT./EXT. SAAB - DAY 
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD -- 
A SIGN reads: 
RANCHO PALOS VERDES PALOS VERDES ESTATES 1/4 MILE 
PAN TO MILES as he signals to change lanes. The finished puzzle lies on the passenger seat. 
EXT. PALOS VERDES STREET - DAY 
The houses on this block are blandly palatial as in so many affluent Southern California suburbs. 
Miles's car pull into the driveway behind an older BMW and two LEXI. He gets out and trots toward the front door. 
INT. ERGANIAN HOUSE - DAY 
A GIANT PROJECTION TV -- 
In a large split-level living room displays a GOLF TOURNAMENT. 
WIDE -- 
Watching from the ultra-comfortable furniture are MIKE ERGANIAN, a tanned, silver-haired real estate caudillo; bride- to-be CHRISTINE ERGANIAN, his oldest daughter; and JACK LOPATE, wearing bowling shirt, shorts and flip-flops. 
MRS. ERGANIAN, a warm and elegant housewife, shows Miles into the room. 
MRS. ERGANIAN Look what the cat dragged! 
MILES Hi, everybody. 
Mr. Erganian and Jack get to their feet and shake hands with Miles. Jack remains affable, but we can discern his genuine irritation. 
JACK About time you got here, bud. Mr. Prompt. 
MR. ERGANIAN We were thinking maybe you took the wrong way and went to Tijuana and they didn't let you back in. 
The Erganians laugh. Miles works up a smile too. 
MILES I had to bribe them. 
More lame laughter. 
CHRISTINE Hey, Miles. 
MILES (leaning in to kiss Christine) Seriously though, the freeway was unbelievable today. Unbelievable. Bumper to bumper the whole way. People getting an early start on the weekend, I guess. Granted I got a late start, but still. 
Although Mr. Erganian presses MUTE on the remote, he keeps watching for an extended moment, as do Jack and Miles. 
MRS. ERGANIAN Christine, why don't you ask Miles about the cake? 
CHRISTINE Oh, good idea. Here, Miles, come to the kitchen with me. 
JACK Don't bother him with that. We got to get going. 
CHRISTINE (taking Miles's hand) It'll just take a second. 
INT. ERGANIAN KITCHEN - DAY 
Jack and the Erganians surround Miles as he eats from a plate with two pieces of CAKE -- one white, one dark. 
MRS. ERGANIAN Jack tells us you are publishing a book. Congratulations. 
MR. ERGANIAN Yes, congratulations. 
Miles shoots Jack a look. Mr. Erganian gets some ice cubes from the refrigerator door. 
MILES Yeah, well, it's not exactly finalized yet, but, um, there has been some interest and -- 
MRS. ERGANIAN (to Jack) Your friend is modest. 
JACK Yeah, Miles, don't be so modest. Indulge them. Don't make me out to be a liar. 
MR. ERGANIAN What subject is your book? Non- fiction? 
MILES No, it's a novel. Fiction. Although there's a lot from my own life, so I guess technically some of it is non- fiction. 
MR. ERGANIAN Good, I like non-fiction. There is so much to know about the world that I think reading a story someone just invented is kind of a waste of time. 
CHRISTINE So which one do you like better? 
MILES I like them both, but if pressed I'd have to say I prefer the dark. 
JACK (to Christine) See? 
INT. SAAB - CONTINUOUS 
IN A REAR VIEW MIRROR -- 
The Erganians wave good-bye.

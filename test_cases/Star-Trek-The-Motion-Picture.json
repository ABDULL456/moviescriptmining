And Spock is already intent on com- putations he is beginning to punch into the science console computer. \nSPOCK I have been monitoring your Starfleet transmissions, Captain, your engine design difficulties. \nSpock continues to punch information into the science computer -- a monitor screen IMAGE begins to show com- plex equations which Spock inspects -- he makes a further computer punch out and inspects a second  monitor IMAGE of other equations. Only then does Spock seem to become aware of Kirk and Decker standing there with questioning expressions. \nSPOCK (continuing) I offer my services as Science Officer. \nKirk starts to grin -- then remembers to wipe it off his face as he turns to Decker. \nKIRK If our Executive Officer has no objections...? \nDECKER (interrupting) Of course not.

Spock gives McCoy a similar glance - turns back to his console readings as: \nUHURA That's how we all feel, Mister... \nThe same cold glance causes Uhura to stop in mid- sentence. Several grins directed toward Spock are now fading from bridge crew faces. Spock has turned back again for a last quick reading at the console and now stands -- totally ignoring everyone else as he speaks coolly, unemotionally to Kirk: SPOCK With your permission, I will now discuss these fuel equations with the Engineer. \nKirk manages a nod, a bit dumbfounded himself at Spock's strange manner. Spock heads for the elevator -- puz- zled expressions from the entire bridge crew. Then Kirk calls after him, very sincerely: \nKIRK Mister Spock, welcome aboard! \nSpock continues onto the elevator without any acknow- ledgment, leaves. Kirk glances, perplexed, at McCoy.

He ignores McCoy totally. \nKIRK You've reported that you felt strong thought emotions. A group of minds from a space vessel? Could you make out any plan, anything to do with Earth? \nSPOCK (still formally) Negative, Captain. I could sense only what seemed an almost omniscient pattern of perfect logic. I can explain nothing more; I understand nothing more. \nKirk is clearly disappointed -- and a bit uncomfortable about what he must ask next. He exchanges a glance with McCoy, then: \nKIRK Also -- there was nothing in your report about why you're here. \nSPOCK That inquiry invades my personal life, Captain. \nMcCOY Spock, we've already guessed why you're here... \nKIRK I inquired about you -- learned you were studying with the Masters... \nAlthough Spock has been almost infuriatingly emotionless, his expression shifts slightly. McCoy indicates this: \nMcCOY That flicker of emotion confirms our guess. You failed. SPOCK (facing McCoy for the first time) Your deductions do you credit, Doctor... if your puerile curiosity does not. \nMcCOY (not in amusement) And now, anger, Spock? \nSpock looks straight ahead -- his face instantly com- posed to almost total blankness. \nSPOCK (beat; nods) I still contain fragments of my human half. KIRK And whatever you sensed out here.... \nSPOCK ... is my only hope of accomplishing what the Masters could not. \nMcCOY If you achieve perfect logic, Spock, you'll pay a price. It's given your planet ten thousand years of peace, but no poetry's been written since then, no music. \nSpock has come to his feet fast - but Kirk is on his feet too, confronting him. During which: \nKIRK Let it drop, Bones.

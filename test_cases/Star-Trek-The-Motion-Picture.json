The CAMERA HOLDS just a moment, then MOVES on, SEARCH- ING through space, the jeweled beauty of other star systems, sparkling nebulae, swirling hydrogen clouds. STILL MOVING, then CAMERA FINDS: \n2   EXT. AREA OF LUMINESCENCE (S)                                2 \nIn the far distance, slowly growing in size as CAMERA APPROACHES: it resembles, vaguely at this distance, an Aurora Borealis: flaring colors from the fringes, beautiful yet ominous. It is so large, this Cloud, it can envelope an entire solar system. CAMERA CONTINUES APPROACHING the Cloud, and then suddenly, crossing our POV, a: 3   KLINGON HEAVY CRUISER (S)                                    3 \nIn a graceful, turning arc toward the mysterious LUMINESCENCE. CAMERA FOLLOWS this Klingon, then FINDS a second Klingon cruiser, also turning toward the Cloud, which continues to grow in size as the Klingons approach at warp speed, CAMERA CLOSING on the lead ship, until the vessel's detail can be clearly MADE OUT: lights, weaponry, power systems, identification emblazoned on the nacelles and saucer in Klingon language (and symbols). \n4   INT. KLINGON CRUISER BRIDGE (O)                              4 \nClearly alien, an ODD-SOUNDING KLAXON signaling \"battle stations.\" Orders issued in KLINGON LANGUAGE, the KLINGON CAPTAIN and EXEC peering at an unusual bridge viewer at the huge area of LUMINESCENT HAZE directly ahead. In KLINGON DIALOGUE: \nKLINGON CAPTAIN (Give me tactical.) \n5   CLOSE - MAIN VIEWER (O)                                      5 \ngoes suddenly  to a TACTICAL GRID SYSTEM, showing the LUMINESCENT HAZE to be an ENORMOUS BLIP OF LIGHT ON THE SCREEN, with two TINY PINPRICKS OF LIGHT complete- ing their turn on a direct course toward it. \n6   EXT. SPACE - THE KLINGON PATROL AND THE HAZE (S)             6 \nThe Patrol is clearly SEEN now on the right of the bottom of the FRAME... THREE tiny ships closing on the \nsteadily growing LUMINESCENT HAZE. \n7   INT. THE KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC (O)               7 \nAll eyes on the viewer that shows the ships sweeping on the Mysterious cloud. \nKLINGON CAPTAIN (In Klingonese) Visual. \nThe TECHNICIAN makes the switch. \n8   CLOSE - VIEW SCREEN - LUMINESCENT HAZE (O)                   8 \ngrowing ever larger, its flaring colors menacing, mysterious, strangely beckoning. \n9   INT. BRIDGE - KLINGON COMMAND CRUISER                        9 \nThe crew stands by for battle. KLINGON CAPTAIN (In Klingonese) Tactical again. Stand by on torpedoes. \n10   EAT SPACE - LEAD KLINGON VESSEL (TORPEDO HATCH) (S)         10 \nsliding open, the glowing \"Hell Fire\" of the Photon Launch tubes, slowly revealed. \n11   VERY WIDE ANGLE - THE THREE SHIPS (S)                       11 \nThey are tiny, insect-like shapes moving still CLOSER to the Luminescent Cloud, so large now that it begins to dominate all space behind. \n12   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID - CAPTAIN AND           12 EXEC (O) \nThe growing nearness and enormous size of the Cloud also reflected on the Tactical Grid, somehow more awesome by this schematic view. The Captain gestures the order to \"FIRE.\" \n13   EXT. SPACE - ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL - TORPEDO HATCH (S)    13 \nThe BRILLIANT PHOTON BLOBS of the torpedoes spurt from the tubes. \n14   ANGLE ON KLINGON VESSEL (S)                                 14 \nA deadly PHOTON TORPEDO pattern racing away from the Klingon and toward the Luminescent glow in the distance. \n15   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - TACTICAL GRID (O)                     15 \nThree torpedoes are heading directly toward the Cloud. Suddenly they glow briefly and disappear long before they reach their intended target. \n16   INT. KLINGON BRIDGE - CAPTAIN AND EXEC                      16 \nincredulous that their torpedoes have disappeared without a trace. \n17   EXT SPACE - THE CLOUD - THREE KLINGON SHIPS (S)             17 \nSpock's neck at an appropriate moment. Spock is staring up as V'ger THEME MUSIC fades. \nMALE MASTER (chidingly) Spock . . . ! \nSpock turns, giving a small contrite nod -- the ritual continues. \nFEMALE MASTER Here are these sands, our fore- bearers cast out their animal passions. Here our race was saved by the first attainment of Kolinahr. MALE MASTER Kolinahr: the final shedding of all emotion. \nFEMALE MASTER You have labored long, Spock. Now receive from us this symbol of total logic. \nSpock starts to kneel... the Female Master moves in, intending to put the ancient pendant around his neck. But Spock now hesitates -- he's troubled as though uncertain he deserves this symbol and waves the pendant away. Then, a faint reprise of the V'ger THEME MUSIC now causes the Female Master to look skyward. She turns from this back to Spock as she exchanges a look with the Male Masters. \nFEMALE MASTER (gestures Spock forward) Come, give me your thoughts. \nShe kneels with Spock -- lays her hands on his temples in Vulcan mind-meld position. \nFEMALE MASTER (continuing) Our minds, Spock... One and together.... \nTheir eyes close -- their minds meld -- then her head jerks slightly, her features change as her mind feels Spock's reactions to the V'ger consciousness. A long moment, then she opens her eyes, gets to her feet and looks down on the still kneeling Spock. Then, she casts aside the pendant she carries -- it falls into the dust. \nFEMALE MASTER (continuing; sadly) This consciousness which calls -- it stirs your human half, Spock? You have not achieved Kolinahr -- Your human emotions are not fully extinguished. (turns to the other Masters) He will not achieve his goal with us. His answer lies elsewhere. \nThe three Masters leave -- Spock watches them go, his disappointment evident even in his stoic features. \n31   MED. ANGLE ON SPOCK (M. & F.P.)                             31 \nCAMERA CLOSES IN on his face as we again HEAR a frag- ment of V'ger THEME MUSIC -- Spock again raises his head and peers up into the heavens. HOLD on his face a moment, then... \nSHOCK CUT TO : \n32   EXT. EARTH - AN AIR TRAM - DAY (S)                          32 \ngleaming silver in the sun as it streaks TOWARD THE CAMERA POSITION and hurtles PAST. \n33   EXT. SAN FRANCISCO - HILLTOP AIR TRAM STATION -             33 DAY (M) \nFrom this vantage, we can SEE all of twenty-third century San Francisco stretched out before us. In the b.g., the familiar forms of the carefully preserved Golden Gate Bridge and Transamerica Pyramid Building serve as our only reminders that this is, indeed, San Francisco. \nThe AIR TRAM (an anti-gravitational train flying several feet above the ground) DECELERATES sharply, settles to the ground with a whisper. \n34   EXT. TRAM STATION - CLOSE ON TRAM DOORS - DAY               34 \nThe doors opening, and various TRAVELERS (civilians and Starfleet personnel) leaving the tram, striding onto the platform, continuing on their respective ways. Among the departing throng: \n35   KIRK                                                        35 \nin Admiral's uniform, grim, determined, moving through the throng. Now and then Starfleet officers nod re- spectfully; KIRK responds with detached formality; his mind is clearly set on something he is resolved to ac- complish here in headquarters -- whatever the cost. CAMERA WITH HIM, to: \n36   INT. AIR TRAM STATION - DAY         `                       36 \nas Kirk strides into the graceful Starfleet HQ building. Many PEOPLE are about, civilians and uniformed person- nel; most of them with some air of urgency. (NOTE: ALIENS interspersed among them, Vulcans, blue-skinned Andorians, high-domed Vegans, ect.) Kirk continues on when suddenly he reacts, annoyed as he sees: \n37   SONAK                                                       37 \na Vulcan, Lt Commander; short, white-haired, grizzled, hurrying along. Kirk calls to him: \nKIRK Commander Sonak... ! \nSONAK turns with Vulcan imperturbability to face Kirk who steps toward him \nKIRK (continuing) You've received your appointment as Enterprise Science Officer? \nSONAK (nods) Based, I am told, on your recommendation, Admiral. Thank you. \nKIRK Why aren't you on board? \nSONAK Captain Decker requested I complete final Science briefing here before... \nKIRK (interrupting) Here at Starfleet...? The Enterprise is in final preparation to leave dock... \nSONAK Which will require twenty more hours at minimum, Admiral... \nKIRK Twelve! I'm on my way to a meeting with Admiral Nogura which will not last more than three minutes. Report to me on the Enterprise in one hour. \nSONAK To you, sir? \nKIRK I intend to be there following that meeting. Report to me. One hour! \nAnd Kirk turns, strides purposefully away. Sonak gazes after him, one eyebrow raised quizzically. \n38   EXT. EARTH ORBIT (S)                                        38 \nIn f.g., Orbital drydock offices, rotating slowly but perceptibly against blue-black of space. Small figures in spacesuits working on construction, with work belts. Beyond and below... Earth. In the far distance we can barely make out an orbital drydock. \n39   CLOSER ANGLE - ORBITAL OFFICE CLUSTER (S)                   39 \nThe cluster is a fully-equipped dockyard engineering center and computer drafting office. \nScott completing the mating procedure, Kirk turning from the observation window. Outside, the metallic.. CLICK of the pod locking onto the airlock. Now the \"WHOOSH\" of the latch doors securing, the CLANG of security bolts. It's all been a rare and delicious moment for Kirk, and his face shows it. \nOVER the POD INTERCOM we HEAR, \"Pod secured. Pressure equalized.\" Scott moves the control to open the hatch. \n58   INT. ENTERPRISE CARGO DECK (M)                              58 \nA confusion of organized work and VOICES. The cargo deck bustles with activity; supplies and equipment being stored and installed. \n59   INT. CARGO DECK - BALCONY AND CATWALK                       59 \nKirk and Scott are met by a nervous, perspiring ENSIGN. \nKIRK AND SCOTT Permission to come aboard, sir...? \nENSIGN Granted, sir. Welcome aboard, Admiral... Commander Scott, you're needed in Engineering immediately. \nSCOTT (to Kirk) Sir, you'll excuse me...? \nKirk gestures him to leave, and Scott hurries away. Kirk stands a moment, gazing down at the cargo deck. \n60   ANGLE DOWN PAST KIRK TO FLOOR (M)                           60 \nThe crew maneuvering antigravity devices which move heavy containers -- scrambles of activity at storage holds and maintenance lockers. \n61   CLOSE ON KIRK AND ENSIGN                                    61 \nKirk is drinking it all in. He's home. \nENSIGN (nervous) Sir, if you'll follow me, I'll... \nKIRK I think I can find my way, Ensign. \nAnd Kirk moves off, leaving the Ensign gazing at him, relieved. \n62   EXT. ELEVATOR AND CATWALK                                   62 \nKirk ENTERS ANGLE and the doors snap open. \n63   INT. ELEVATOR                                               63 \nas Kirk enters. The doors close. Kirk waits a beat, savoring this moment too. Then, firmly to the control panel: \nKIRK Bridge! \nThe turbo-elevator HUMS WITH POWER as it begins hur- tling up. On the wall back of Kirk we SEE an electronic diagram of the Enterprise tracking the elevator's speedy trip to the Bridge. \n64   INT. BRIDGE                                                 64 \nA confusion of activity and VOICES. Pieces o equip- ment in a state of disarray: consoles open, fiber optic tubes unconnected, viewing screens dismantled. It's a frantic, desperate scene -- a ship and crew to- tally unprepared. In the midst of this: ALIEN ensign is assisting UHURA (Lt. Comdr. stripes)deftly working her communications station, AD LIBBING \"... Hailing frequency four, check. Hailing frequency five, will someone please check me?\" At the helm, sweat-soaked SULU (Lt. Comdr stripes) has a service plate open, is peering inside to make delicate adjust- ments, AD LIBBING \"... Helm, now give me a reading on four point zero zero six of full.\" And at the Weapons Control, CHEKOV (Full Lt.)argues with TECHNICIANS who insist photon torpedoes read \"ready\" while Chekov argues the computer is not relaying that information. \n65   ANGLE ON THE ELEVATOR DOORS                                 65 \nsnapping open -- and there is Kirk. For the moment no one notices him, and he stands watching, remembering. And then he moves forward toward the command center. \n66   ACROSS UHURA TO KIRK                                        66 \nas she is the first to see him. She reacts,pleased. \nUHURA Captain... Starfleet just signaled your transfer-of- command orders! \n67   ANOTHER ANGLE - VARIOUS REACTION                            67 \nas everyone else is suddenly aware of Kirk. \nAll work stops, with various AD LIBBED greetings from the old crew: \"Admiral Kirk...\" \"It's the Captain...!\" etc., etc. But most sit or stand, simple gaping at Kirk, all quite awed. The old hands, Uhura, Sulu, and Chekov start converging on Kirk. But he gestures them back, speaking crisply. KIRK I appreciate the welcome; I wish the circumstances were less critical. (to Uhura) Epsilon Nine is monitoring the intruder; keep a channel open to them. (glances around) Where is Captain Decker? \nSULU He's in Engineering, sir... (uncomfortable, indicates Captain's chair) He doesn't know. \nKirk reacts with some exasperation, starts away, addresses Chekov: \nKIRK Mr Chekov, assemble the crew on the Rec Deck at 0400 hours. I want to show them what we're facing. \nAnd Kirk moves to the elevator, enters, is gone. The moment the elevator doors snap closed: \nSULU I wouldn't have wanted to have been standing in his way. He wanted her back; he got her! \nALIEN ENSIGN (perturbed) And Captain Decker? He's been with the ship every minute of her refitting... \nUHURA (brittle) Ensign -- our chances of coming back from this mission in one piece may have just doubled...! \n68   OMITTED                                                     68 \n70   INT. ENGINEERING SECTION                                    70 \nThe entire complex a beehive of pre-departure activity. ENGINEERING PERSONNEL (at least a third of them female) coming and going, the platform-elevators (small, one- man lifts to various levels) busy. A gentle but con- stant HUM and WHIRR flows from the engine core, to indi- cate a pre-idling mode. There will be continual AD LIBBED conversation among the Technicians. \nNow the Engine Room door opens and Kirk steps into the area. He stands a moment observing the activity. a grizzled ENGINEERING CHIEF pushes a huge condenser on an anti-grav device past irk with a respectful \"watch it, sir\" admonishment. Kirk moves on to: \nSTARFLEET VOICE Unable to retrieve their pattern, Enterprise....! \nRand reacts in real horror now as human forms begin to FAINTLY MATERIALIZE, then FADE AWAY, then REAPPEAR IN FAINTLY MISSHAPEN FORM as she frantically works con- trols. Kirk ENTERS fast, steps to the console to assist Rand; Scott has also come in and moves to the console, brushes aside the Asst. Chief, and begins manipulating the additional controls himself. \nSCOTT We're losing the pattern...! \nKIRK (into intercom) Starfleet, boost your matter gain; we need more signal! \nRAND Oh, no! They're forming! \n77   CLOSER ON THE TRANSPORTER CHAMBER (O)                       77 \nwith the human forms FLUTTERING INTO FULLER AND FULLER MATERIALIZATION, FRIGHTENINGLY, HORRIBLY MISSHAPEN. We RECOGNIZE one form as the Vulcan, Sonak -- the other a human WOMAN. They MATERIALIZE; we HEAR A MOAN form from the Vulcan -- the Woman's SCREAM OF PAIN. Then, all at once, the half-materialized bodies are gone; the transporter chamber is empty. \nKIRK Oh, my God...! \n78   KIRK, SCOTT AND RAND                                        78 \ngazing, horrified, at the empty chamber. \nKIRK (into intercom) Starfleet, do you have them? \nA mutter of utter, vacant silence -- and Kirk and Scott look at each other again, their pained faces presaging the answer they already know: \nSTARFLEET VOICE (shaken) Enterprise... what we got back didn't live long. Fortunately. \nAnother moment of stunned silence, and then Kirk hits the transmission button -- fighting to control his voice as: \nKIRK Starfleet... Kirk. Please... express my condolences to their families. Commander Sonak's can be reached through the Vulcan Embassy. (see Rand's stricken expression) There was nothing you could have done, Rand. It wasn't your fault. \nAnd before Rand can answer, Kirk leaves the room. \n79   INT. CORRIDOR - TRAVELING WITH KIRK                         79 \nas Kirk steps out, and the doors snap closed behind him. In the corridor the furor of the hurried depar- ture is, as everywhere, quite evident: CREW MEMBERS move back and forth. But Kirk does not see them; his mind is tormented by the transporter accident -- was there something he should have done, could have done, to prevent it? Should he launch on schedule with the starship this unready? Has he done right in yielding to this terrible needs for starship command again, forcing Starfleet to give her to him? Would Decker's knowledge of the new design have prevented the acci- dent? \nKirk reaches a corridor intersection, looks around, realizes he's lost track of where he is. A passing YEOMAN stops in response to his puzzled expression. \nKIRK Turboshaft eight...? \nYEOMAN Back that way, sir. \nShe's indicating back the direction from which Kirk came. He nods his thanks, turns and moves back down the corridor. \n80   DECKER                                                      80 \nhurrying down the corridor. The two face each other a silent moment, Decker studying Kirk curiously. \nKIRK We'll have to replace Commander Sonak. I'd still like a Vulcan there, if possible... \nDECKER None available, Captain. There's no one in fact, who's fully rated on this design. \nKIRK You are, Mister Decker. I'm afraid you'll have to double as Science Officer. \nAnd Kirk moves on, Decker stands gazing reflectively after him. \n81    OMITTED                                                    81 \n85    CLOSE - FULL SHOT OF THE KLINGON SHIP BEING DESTROYED      85 (AS SEEN ON VIEWER) (O) (in the last part of the scene which showed the Klingon Captain speaking in Klingonese and an English print- out interpretation appearing at the screen bottom. The Klingon ship nearly totaled; one engine nacelle gone, smoke and flame spewing from the other, etc. And then that final WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT STRIKING AND SPECTACULARLY DESTROYING THE SHIP, etc.) \nBut this time, O.S., we HEAR GASPS of incredulity from many throats (an audience), and various AD LIBBED com- ments: \"My God...!\" \"I don't believe it...!\" \"What could it be...?\" Etc., etc. \nAnd then, immediately following this, on the viewer: \n86   THE LUMINESCENT CLOUD (AS SEEN ON A VIEWER) (O)             86 \n(as in earlier Epsilon 9 viewer -- but with no music, only more AD LIBBED exclamations from an audience.) The viewer goes blank. \n87   INT. RECREATION DECK (M)                                    87 \nWe SEE that all this was being viewed by the CREW MEMBERS (Aliens included) assembled on the Rec Deck. \nThe Recreation Deck is one of the largest areas on the ship, several deck levels high, a part of one wall consisting of picture windows, through which can be seen sections of the drydock structure outside. \nOn another wall is a large viewer, on which was just shown the Klingon transmission. Leading off and away from this deck area are what are obviously other specific recreation areas -- gymnasiums, food centers, game rooms, lounges, etc. \n88   ANOTHER ANGLE OF THE RED DECK - HIGHER LEVEL                88 \nas the Crew Members chat in low, grim tones -- Kirk (now with Captain's stripes) appears. As he comes into view, the two hundred or so crew below go silent. Kirk grimly indicates the now blank viewer: \nKIRK That's all we know about it; except that it's now 2.2 days from Earth. Enterprise is the only Federation starship that stands in its way. \n89   ANOTHER ANGLE - CREW REACTIONS                              89 \nas the CAMERA FINDS various faces: human, alien; most young, all intelligent, forthright -- anxious. Kirk has paused a moment, now continues. \nKIRK (O.S.) We assume there is a vessel of some type at the heart of the cloud. Our orders are to intercept, investigate; and take whatever action is necessary... and possible. (beat) ...We can only hope that the life form aboard that vessel reasons as we do. \nKIRK (formally; rising) Welcome aboard, Lieutenant. \n99   ACROSS ILIA TO DECKER                                       99 \nas Ilia starts to speak, suddenly stops: she has just then noticed Decker, who has stepped from his station to face her. For an electronic moment their eyes meet, hold in unquestioned recognition. \nDECKER Hello, Ilia. \nILIA (surprised) Decker....! \nKirk has observed this with surprise and some concern (it presages possible complications). Decker turns to Kirk, slightly uncomfortable at this. DECKER I was stationed on the Lieutenant's home planet some years ago... \nIlia looks from Kirk back to Decker, puzzled at his sleeve stripes. \nILIA (eyes his rank stripes) 'Commander' Decker? \nKIRK Our Exec and Science Officer... \nDECKER (bitingly) Captain Kirk has the utmost confidence in me. \nKirk flashes a hard glance at Decker, then toward Ilia too. \nKIRK (pointedly) And in you, too, Lieutenant. \nILIA My oath of celibacy is on record Captain. May I assume my duties? \nWhile respectful, her tone of voice has been just as firm as Kirk's. \nKIRK By all means. \n100   ACROSS KIRK TO UHURA                                       100 \nreceiving a message, now relaying it. \nUHURA Captain, Starfleet reports our last six crew members ready to beam up... (puzzled) ... but one of them is refusing to step into the transporter. \nJust as Kirk a moment before was tense, now suddenly he's relaxed again; he rises. \nKIRK (pleased) Oh? I'll see that he beams up...! \nAnd he hurries from the bridge, onto the elevator, is gone. A moment of puzzled silence, then: DECKER Mr. Sulu, take Lieutenant Ilia in hand. \nSULU (startled) Sir...? (then understands) Yes, of course... (to Ilia) Your pre-programming is already set in, Lieutenant. \nSulu has almost tripped getting out of his chair. He starts offering Ilia his hand, then thinks better of it, withdraws it abruptly, immediately busies himself punching out equations on her console... AD LIBS, \"It's all on the computer. You'll have no problem...\" Sulu is nervous, fluttery around this lovely creature -- now hits a wrong switch. Produces a BEEPING SOUND which he fumbles to shut off. She smiles; speaks quietly, repeats: \nILIA I'm sworn to celibacy, Mister Sulu. That makes me as safe as any human female. \nSulu catches her eye but before he can reply, Decker has moved in beside Ilia. \nDECKER I now the Captain meant no person- al insult. \nILIA (eyes on console) I would never take advantage of a sexually immature species. (looks at him) You can assure him that's true, can't you? \nClearly, the remark carries special, personal significance. \n101    INT. TRANSPORTER ROOM                                      101 \nKirk entering as Rand and her assistant electronically list the last of the five arrivals who are leaving the Transporter Chamber. Kirk calls through intercom to the last arrival, a young female Yeoman. \nKIRK Yeoman, what was the problem down there? \nYEOMAN (through intercom) He insisted we go first, sir. Said something about first seeing how it scrambled our molecules. \nKIRK Thank you, Yeoman (hits transmit control) Starfleet , this is Captain Kirk. The officer is to be beamed up immediately! \n103   ANGLE ON THE CHAMBER (O)                                   103 \nA moment, then again the GENERATING HUMMING, and then the familiar BEAMING EFFECT. And then you SEE McCOY! He fully MATERIALIZES. He looks himself over as if in pleased surprise he is still in one piece. CAMERA PANS McCoy from the Transporter Chamber to Kirk who is hav- ing a hard time containing his amusement and delight. \nKIRK Well, for a man who swore he'd never return to Starfleet... \nMcCOY (flat, tight) What happened, Captain, sir, was that your revered Admiral Nogura invoked a little known -- and seldom used -- reserve activation clause... (snaps) ... in simpler language, Captain, sir, they drafted me! \nKIRK (straight-faced) They didn't...! \nKirk has offered his hand, but McCoy is already flaring: \nMcCOY This was your idea! It was your idea, wasn't it! \nKIRK Bones, there's a 'thing' out there -- \nMcCOY -- Why is any object we don't understand called a 'thing'? \nKIRK (continues) -- headed this way. I need you... McCOY Were you behind this? \nKIRK (nods) Bones, I need you badly. \n120   EXT.

McCoy is his usual dour self. \nKIRK Well, Bones, do the new medical facilities meet with your approval? \nMcCOY They do not. It's like working in a damned computer center. \nKIRK (turning to Decker) Programming ready? \nDECKER Program set for standard Warp entry, Captain... \nKirk starts to swing his chair to normal position -- Decker calls: \nDECKER (continuing) ... but I still recommend further simulation study. \nKIRK Mister Decker; every minute brings that object nearer Earth! (using intercom) Engineering! Stand by for Warp Drive. \nMcCoy is watching Kirk, a bit surprised at his abrupt- ness to Decker. \nSCOTT'S INTERCOM VOICE (worried) Captain, we need further Warp simulation on the flow sensors... \nKIRK Engineer, we need Warp speed now! \nMcCOY (very gently) You're pushing Jim.

Then, the Bridge crew AD LIB their surprise and pleasure. \nKIRK Spock...! Spock, where...how...? \nKirk, smiling, is moving toward Spock with hand out- stretched. But Spock has already turned and moved toward the science console where Decker sits. \nSPOCK Commander, if I may...? \n150A  AT SCIENCE CONSOLE                                        150A \nIt takes Decker a moment to realize that Spock wants to take over the console. He begins getting to his feet, throwing Kirk a look. But Kirk's attention is totally on SPOCK. And Spock is already intent on com- putations he is beginning to punch into the science console computer. \nSPOCK I have been monitoring your Starfleet transmissions, Captain, your engine design difficulties. \nSpock continues to punch information into the science computer -- a monitor screen IMAGE begins to show com- plex equations which Spock inspects -- he makes a further computer punch out and inspects a second  monitor IMAGE of other equations. Only then does Spock seem to become aware of Kirk and Decker standing there with questioning expressions. \nSPOCK (continuing) I offer my services as Science Officer. \nKirk starts to grin -- then remembers to wipe it off his face as he turns to Decker. \nKIRK If our Executive Officer has no objections...? \nDECKER (interrupting) Of course not. I'm aware of Mister Spock's qualifications. \nKIRK (grinning openly now; turns, calls) Mister Chekov, log Mister Spock's Starfleet commission reactivated; list him as Science Officer; both effective immediately. \n151   ANGLE TO INCLUDE ELEVATOR DOORS                             151 \nas they SNAP open -- McCoy and Chapel appear. Chapel sees Spock at the science console -- she moves in quickly, overjoyed. Even McCoy seems pleased. \nCHAPEL Mr. Spock...!!! \nMcCOY So help me, I'm actually pleased to see you. \nBut as Chapel crosses to Spock, her pleased smile brightening her whole face, Spock turns, dismisses her presence with a cold disinterested glance -- Chapel stops, stands dumbfounded. Spock gives McCoy a similar glance - turns back to his console readings as: \nUHURA That's how we all feel, Mister... \nThe same cold glance causes Uhura to stop in mid- sentence. Several grins directed toward Spock are now fading from bridge crew faces. Spock has turned back again for a last quick reading at the console and now stands -- totally ignoring everyone else as he speaks coolly, unemotionally to Kirk: SPOCK With your permission, I will now discuss these fuel equations with the Engineer. \nKirk manages a nod, a bit dumbfounded himself at Spock's strange manner. Spock heads for the elevator -- puz- zled expressions from the entire bridge crew. Then Kirk calls after him, very sincerely: \nKIRK Mister Spock, welcome aboard! \nSpock continues onto the elevator without any acknow- ledgment, leaves. Kirk glances, perplexed, at McCoy. McCoy, equally perplexed, shrugs. \nMcCOY Never look a gift Vulcan in the ears, Jim. \n152   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE (S)                            152 \ntraveling past the stars, sub-warp.

(to Spock) Cloud composition, Mr. Spock? \nSPOCK Twelve power energy field -- \nSULU (in disbelief) -- twelve power?! \nDECKER (urgently) Captain, we've seen what their weapons can do. Shouldn't we take every possible precaution -- ? \nKIRK Mr Decker.... \nSPOCK (interrupting) Captain, I suspect there's an object at the heart of that cloud. \nKIRK (cool) Mr. Decker, I will not provoke an attack, If that order isn't clear to you... \nDECKER (interrupting in mid sentence) Captain, as your Exec, it's my duty to point out alternatives. \nA moment of thought from Kirk.

Spock's attention is on the O.S. main viewer, totally absorbed by something he's feeling. He is slowly rising from his seat, stepping forward -- Kirk becomes conscious of this, turns and sees Spock's strange expression. Before he can speak: \nSPOCK They have... they have been communicating with us. I sense ... puzzlement. Why have we not replied? \nKIRK Communicated with us how? \nSpock shakes his head... then reacts as if sensing or theorizing something further. He turns, moves quickly to his console, begins there as if searching for something. Interrupted by another ALARM KLAXON. \nDECKER Signal medical alert, Mister Chekov! \nCOMPUTER VOICE Incoming fire.

Then he shakes head. \nSPOCK The 'puzzlement' I sensed was fleeting... minor... (ponders, then) ... as if carrying a sense of our insignificance, Captain. \nKIRK Our... 'insignificance'? \nAll have reacted to this; Kirk exchanges a look with Spock who nods firmly. Then Kirk sees that both Decker and Sulu are throwing him a questioning look. In b.g. McCoy and Chapel have EXITED bridge with Chekov. \nSPOCK We are obviously confronted by a highly advanced mentality... yet they cannot understand who we are, or what we want. \nKIRK But they understood our messages; they broke off the attack. \nDECKER They may have attacked only as a warning to us, Captain. To keep away. \nSPOCK That would presuppose a feeling, Commander... compassion. I sensed no emotion, only... (reverentially) ... pure logic. \nKirk peers at Spock hoping for some assistance on the decision; but Spock merely peers back at him ex- pressionlessly: the decision is Kirk's.

These blinking Enterprise schematics show that the starship has  gone from a head-on approach to the Cloud into a (tech. advice) skidding movement around the Cloud (the star- ship always heading directly toward Cloud center), with the last Enterprise positions now showing it ap- roaching the Cloud from a quartering rear approach. \n185XD   REVERSE ANGLE                                             85XD \nILIA Thirty seconds to Cloud boundary... \nKIRK Opinion, Mister.

Moving into the cloud -- at this time, is an unwarranted gamble. \nKIRK How do you define unwarranted, mister?! \nDECKER You asked my opinion, sir. \nKirk looks at him, then at Spock, who once more is peering in momentary concentration at the viewer, feels Kirk's gaze -- and turns to him, again expres- sionlessly; it's up to Kirk. \nILIA Fifteen seconds to Cloud Boundary. \nKIRK Viewer, standard ahead. \n185XE   ANGLE TO INCLUDE VIEWER (O)                              185XE \nMain viewer IMAGE reverts to the \"powerful cloud.\" All peer in grim fascination at the cloud another moment.

The Alien vessel is still GROWING IN SIZE -- more and more, its exterior appears to be made of substances never before seen by a human eye -- substances considered possible only in the wildest flights of scientific theory -- plasma-matter, energy fields diamond--hard in their power, solid sheets of subatomic particles, crystalline-lace patterns which seem capable of shifting their nature and rearranging themselves. \n205A   ANGLE ON INTRUDER                                         205A \nThis time, the Enterprise travels on away from us, as its course takes it angling nearer and nearer the gigantic Alien Intruder -- the Starship dwindling in size, growing smaller, smaller, smaller... until it is a tiny dot compared to the enormity of the Alien vessel. \n206   INT.

Suddenly, in b.g., an elevator door snaps oen and two SECURITY MEN burst onto the bridge, phasers drawn. Chekov shouts warningly at the Men: \nCHEKOV No weapons...! \nBut Chekov is too late: First Security Man FIRES -- the BLAST harmlessly absorbed by the Probe which emits a SCREECHING nerve-grating SOUND --- sends out a SMALL WHIPLASH ENERGY BOLT which instantly envelopes First Security Man in a PURPLE GLOW (of implosion). Second Security Man has almost lifted his phaser -- but now carefully, slowly is moving his hand away from his weapon. \n210   CLOSER - THE SECURITY MEN (O)                              210 \nPURPLE GLOW FADES, the First Security Man has simply vanished. \n210A   FULL SHOT - BRIDGE                                        210A \nChekov, like the others, horrified, flips a switch and the COMPUTER-VOICE (\"Intruder Alert\") goes OFF. At the same time Chekov speaks into his intercom: \nCHEKOV Security... do not send further teams! \nThe Probe is sending out snake-like tendrils to the various consoles on the bridge. \nThese tendrils lash out in a cobra-strike movement, the tendril-head seeming to enter into the console affected -- at which time all monitors and instrument lights there come ON as if the Probe is \"reading\" each console function. The crew carefully stays clear of the tendrils. \nSpock has risen, moving to Kirk's side as he slowly brings his tricorder up, very carefully extracting its tiny sensor and aiming it at the probe. \nCHEKOV (shaken) No intruder readings on other decks, Captain... (to Spock) Can that be one of their crew? \nSPOCK (quiet) A probe from their vessel... (to Kirk) A plasma-energy combination... \nMeanwhile, the probe is now hovering near Chekov who sits frozen, fists clenched, jaw tight. \nDECKER Don't interfere with it...! \nCHEKOV Absolutely, I will not interfere! \n210B   ANGLE INCLUDING SPOCK'S CONSOLE (O)                       210B \nas the \"probe\" withdraws an energy-tendril from one bridge station and \"inserts\" it into another console. \nKIRK No one interfere...!

Spock clasps his fists above his head, brings it down in a SHATTERING BLOW on the console. It splits open! As the bridge lights dim even more, and as the science console shorts itself out -- and off, Decker confronts Spock: \nDECKER We could have cut it off at the main computer... \nSPOCK This served the purpose. \nKirk has been giving Spock a puzzled look -- Spock now turns abruptly, and: \nAs \"Ilia\" moves on into the room, Decker follows: \"ILIA\" The words 'recreation' and 'enjoy' have no meaning to my programming. \nDecker peers at the lovely android with frustration -- and no little pain, for she is after all the exact replica of Ilia. She pays not the slightest attention to Decker's reaction, and begins walking about the Rec Deck taking in (and, clearly, transmitting all images to V'ger) the sights. They are near a game area (elec- tronic games), and now Decker points to one game, switches it on -- presses button to activate its LIGHTS and SOUNDS. \"Ilia\" watches interestedly as Decker operates the game. \nDECKER Ilia 'enjoyed' this game... she nearly always won -- \nAnd he demonstrates again, as \"Ilia\" steps to the device, deftly hits some buttons -- and for just an instant she turns to Decker with a momentary glimmer of recognition. \n269   INT.

In what way is the life form in your vessel different? \n\"ILIA\" Carbon units are not true life forms... Do those images repre- sent how Enterprise has evolved into its present form? \nDECKER (hoping he's struck a responsive chord) Yes. \n\"ILIA\" Carbon units have clearly retarded Enterprise's proper evolvement. \nDECKER (controlling surprise) What is Enterprise's proper evolvement? \n\"ILIA\" Enterprise should not require the presence of carbon units. \nAnd with this she moves off, observing other Rec Deck objects. Decker moves with her; then: \nDECKER (carefully) Enterprise would be unable to function without carbon units. \n\"ILIA\" More data concerning this functioning is necessary before carbon units can be patterned for data storage. \n271   ACROSS \"ILIA\" TO DECKER                                    271 \nas he reacts to this ominous note; he stops abruptly. \nDECKER What does that mean? \n\"ILIA\" (stopping; almost pleasantly) When my examination is complete, the carbon units will be reduced to data patterns. \nThis has been delivered with chilling blandness, and she stands facing Decker, almost as though waiting for him to thank her.

Up through the hatch a circular airlock door opens -- and a tiny figure in a thruster spacesuit emerges, steps into space, slowly floats down through the hatch and under the Enterprise saucer section. In this and subsequent VIEWS we will SEE that on the rear pack of his thruster spacesuit is a FLASHING STROBE LIGHT which regularly EMITS the identifying SIGNAL of this particular suit. (By which Kirk will be able to see Spock's position even from several miles away.) \n274   CLOSER ON THE SPACESUITED FIGURE (M)                       274 \nMOVING TOWARD the CAMERA until the features behind the face mask are clearly identifiable: Spock, his face set in the same grim, determined expression, as he touches his spacesuit transmitter control. \nSPOCK Computer, commence recording.

But Decker has an obvious reply: \nDECKER They want to make contact with V'ger... (trying to revive \"Ilia's\" memory again; touches her hand) Ilia... \n\"Ilia\" peers at him blankly, allows him to continue touching her hand, but obviously it means nothing to her. \nDECKER (continuing; distressed, to \"Ilia\") Does V'ger object to the presence of the two carbon units? \n\"ILIA\" The carbon units are of no consequence; V'ger will determine their purpose. \nMcCOY Their purpose is to survive. \n\"ILIA\" That is also V'ger's purpose. \nDecker's face reflects his bemusement: \nDECKER You said V'ger's purpose was to find and join with the Creator. \n\"ILIA\" That is how V'ger will survive. \n286   ON DECKER                                                  286 \nas now, the bemusement changes to just the slightest enlightenment. \n\"ILIA\" I wish to continue my observations. \n287   INT.

Also, a \npattern of the Security Guard killed by the probe. And Ilia. KIRK Klingons... our Epsilon 9 station ... and Ilia!! They seem to be more than just images... \nSPOCK (agreeing) Exact patterns. The energy bolt that hit them wasn't simply a weapon -- it dematerialized them, stored them.

Or is their entire ship automated? \nSPOCK Captain, I do not believe there is a crew -- or that this is a vessel as such. \nA beat, as Kirk reacts incredulously. \nSPOCK (continuing) I am almost certain now that all of this is V'ger -- I believe that we are inside a life form, a living machine. \nSpock turns his spacesuit, turns his tricorder out to- ward the Mediator Balls, takes a reading in that di- rection. Then a glance to Kirk. \nSPOCK I must attempt mindmeld with it, Captain. \nSpock touches his spacesuit controls; the THRUSTER JETS move him out toward the Mediator Balls. \nKIRK (warningly) Spock... \n313   ANGLE AT MEDIATOR BALL                                     313 \nSpock reaching the Ball, halts his momentum and removes one gauntlet, baring his hand. Stretching the bare hand toward a part of it which looks strangely \"alive.\" The very power generated from this area is clearly affecting Spock's hand. Meanwhile, Kirk has used his THRUSTERS to join him. \nKIRK Spock, if you're right, its mind may be enormous... \nBut Spock pays him no attention, his entire being now focused on the PULSATING GLOW of the \"alive\" area -- the CAMERA MOVING IN CLOSER TO Spock, as he forces his hand toward that surface, closer, closer. \n314   KIRK                                                       314 \nwatching, almost mesmerized.

Spock seems to be attempting to focus, orient himself as Kirk and McCoy hurry to the bedside. \nSPOCK (quiet) Jim... \nAnd Spock reaches out a hand weakly., takes a surprised Kirk's hand in his.

Suddenly, almost into the corridor, \"Ilia\" turns and looks back at the engine room. She addresses Decker, but load enough for Scott to overhear: \n\"ILIA\" There is no logical reason for carbon units to control Enterprise's power systems. \nSCOTT (to \"Ilia\") Lassie, if I were functioning 'logically,' right now I'd be showing you the inside of our scrap metal compactor! \n327   INT.

It is an ominous looking, HUGE SWIRLING GREEN MASS -- it resembles the same green plasma-energy bolts that destroyed the Klingons and Epsilon 9 -- and very nearly the Enterprise. It is not a bolt now -- the mass is much larger and appears much more deadly. A second object has now formed and moves off, a third one begins to appear. (Meanwhile, the first and second PLASMA- ENERGY OBJECTS are moving off into the distance in different direction.) \nMcCOY My God! They're the same kind of things that destroyed the Klingons, Epsilon Nine... \nSPOCK (interrupting; from science console) These read as identical composition...

The bridge lighting dims, and now Kirk looks at Spock, who nods approvingly; clearly Spock is the only person who seems to comprehend what Kirk is doing, and why. As Kirk now moves toward the exit, and the lights are dimmed even further: \n\"ILIA\" (almost polite) Kirk-unit, why do you not disclose information? \nKIRK Because V'ger is going to destroy all the carbon units on the third planet. \n\"ILIA\" They have repressed the Creator. \nKIRK The information will not be disclosed. \nAnd, gesturing the others ahead of him, Kirk starts toward the bridge elevator. \"Ilia\" calls after him: \n\"ILIA\" (almost a plea) V'ger needs the information. \n340   AT THE ELEVATORS                                           340 \nDecker and McCoy about to enter, Spock and Kirk just behind -- all stopping abruptly now at \"Ilia's\" state- ment.

Kirk is speechless a moment, glances at McCoy who has also witnessed this phenomenon, and started toward Spock; but Kirk gestures McCoy to stay back, as he addresses Spock: \nKIRK (quiet, feeling) Not for us? \nSPOCK No, Captain, not for us... for V'ger. Spock pauses as Kirk peers incredulously at him, then continues: \nSPOCK (continuing) I weep for V'ger, as I would for a brother -- far more knowledgeable than I -- and yet one step behind. \n354   ANGLE ON McCOY AND DECKER                                  354 \nListening, McCoy's face reflecting concern; Decker's face compassion and understanding, with Decker step- ping closer to Spock, as Spock continues: \nSPOCK As I was -- when I came aboard... so is V'ger now: empty, incomplete. Searching. Logic and knowledge are not enough. \nMcCOY (with empathy) Spock, are you saying that you found, what you needed -- but V'ger hasn't? \nSPOCK Has not, Doctor -- and now, because of what we are planning... will not... \nKIRK (almost hard) There is no alternative. \nDECKER (gently pressing) Mr. Spock, what would V'ger need to fulfill itself? \nSPOCK V'ger has begun to understand the true limits of our universe, thereby realizing the existence of other dimensions. To fulfill itself it must evolve to a higher dimension; V'ger believes this can be achieved only by joining with the Creator. \nSPOCK (ALTERNATIVE) Each of us, at some time in our life, turns to someone, a father, a brother, a God and asks 'Why am I here?' 'What was I meant to be?'

Kirk hesitates, gathering his thoughts: \nKIRK (to \"Ilia\") Our data is being prepared. \"ILIA\" Answer! \nKIRK We will answer and present proof of our answer when it is ready! \nKirk's words lead to a suggestion of FRUSTRATION in the STORM OF LIGHT AND SOUND around them. \nKIRK (continuing) V'ger, we will bring the Creator to you!

Believe me... \nDecker has reached out to touch her -- the probe spins at his touch -- the move knocks Decker from his feet, tumbling, a hard fall. Then the robe looks at him lying there -- just the slightest softening of her features now. \n368   EMPHASIZING DECKER                                         368 \nslowly turning to face the probe again. \nDECKER Ilia, believe me... the Creator will appear! \n369   EMPHASIZING \"ILIA\"                                         369 \nas she meets Decker's look, her expression softening still more.

When they went into anti-matter imbalance, the phasers were automatically cut off. \nKirk is surprised by this information, perhaps slight- ly chagrined. After a beat: \nKIRK Then you acted properly, of course. \nDECKER Thank you, sir.

(a beat, as Kirk reacts) You pulled every string in the book short of blackmail to get the Enterprise -- maybe even that. And when this mission is over, you have no intention of giving her back. \nKIRK (tight) I intend to keep her, is that what you're saying, Doctor? \nMcCOY It's an obsession -- that can blind you so far more immediate -- and critical responsibilities.

Suppose that beneath its programming, the real Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision. \nKIRK They had a pattern to follow... \nSPOCK (nods) ... they may have followed it too precisely. \n", "test3_true": "259A   ANGLE ON DECKER                                           259A \nalso comprehending, and not liking it one bit as Spock and Kirk are both turning their attention to him. \nSPOCK Exactly. (to Decker) And you did have a 'relationship' with Lieutenant Ilia, Commander. \nDECKER That probe in there -- in a different form now -- is the same thing that killed Ilia! \nKIRK Commander, we're locked in an alien vessel, six hours from Earth orbit, our only contact with our captors is the probe. If we can control it, persuade it, use it in some way... \nInterrupted by the SOUND of someone trying to open the locked door behind them. Then a METAL RIPPING SOUND as they whirl to see: \n260   MEDICAL OFFICE DOOR                                        260 \nwith the METAL BUCKLING, TEARING -- and a single hand slicing the steel door like paper. It is the \"Ilia\" probe, her face absolutely impassive, her whole manner incongruously benign. (Behind her, a startled McCoy, Chapel and Chekov.) \"Ilia\" speaks flatly, blandly. \n\"ILIA\" I have recorded enough here. (motions to Kirk) You will now assist me further. \nKirk exchanges a quick glance with Spock. Then: \nKIRK (indicating Decker) The Decker-unit can assist you with much greater efficiency... \"Ilia\" has seemed about to object -- but now her eyes hold on Decker. Then she nods. \nKIRK (continuing) Carry on with your assignment, Mr. Decker. \n260A   ANOTHER ANGLE - ACROSS DECKER TO THE SMASHED DOOR         260A (AND \"ILIA\") \nas Decker looks at \"Ilia\" who stands at the torn door. You can read Decker's mind: I'm supposed to persuade that?! He turns back, finds Kirk's eyes on him. Decker nods. \nDECKER Aye, sir. \n\"Ilia\" and a reluctant Decker EXIT. \n260B   EMPHASIZING SPOCK                                         260B \nlooking very troubled as they watch Decker and \"Ilia\" leave. Kirk notices. \nKIRK Spock? Concerned about his chances? \nSPOCK I am uneasy with that being our only hope of more information. \nSpock EXITS. \n261    INT. V'GER - THE ENTERPRISE                                261 \nfloating in the vast, eerie, alien chamber -- sporadic FLASHES OF ENERGY, erupting now and then. Various other EFFECTS. OVER this, Kirk's VOICE: \nKIRK (V.O.) Captain's Log. Stardate 7414.1. Our best estimates place us some four hours from Earth. No significant Ilia memory patterns within the alien probe. This remains our only means of contact with our captor. \n262   INT. ENTERPRISE AIRLOCK AREA                               262 \nThe area dimly lit -- unoccupied but for a lone AIRLOCK TECHNICIAN checking and adjusting instruments. The CAMERA MOVES PAST him to FIND: \n263   SPOCK                                                      263 \nHis face fixed with grim determination, walking quietly with obvious intent not to attract the Tech's attention. Now he steals up behind the TECH -- and in an instant has applied a Vulcan nerve pinch. The Tech slumps over his console. \n264   INT KIRK'S CABIN - VIEWER MONITOR                          264 \nShowing a CLOSE SHOT of ENTERPRISE PICTURES, then PULL BACK SLIGHTLY for an IMAGE of Decker and \"Ilia\" walk- ing through the Rec Deck. PULL BACK FURTHER TO SHOW Kirk watching this -- and with him is McCoy. They continue watching a troubled beat, as: \nDECKER (of pictures) All these vessels were called \"Enterprise\". \n\"Ilia\" is giving the pictures a very interested look as we HEAR in Kirk's cabin: \nUHURA'S INTERCOM VOICE (controlled excitement) Bridge to Captain... \n265   OMITTED                                                    265 \n266   INT. BRIDGE - UHURA'S STATION (SCIENCE STATION IN          266 B.G.) \nUhura at her console, struggling to hear the signal. \nKIRK'S INTERCOM VOICE Kirk here. In the b.g., Spock's station a MAINTENANCE TEAM is replacing the broken Science Station computer. (Spock is conspicuously absent.) \nUHURA A faint signal from Starfleet, sir. They have the intruder on their monitors... (struggling to hear) They show us... three hours... twenty-four minutes from Earth! \nKIRK'S VOICE (thru intercom) Thank you. \n267   INT. RECREATION DECK                                       267 \nDecker and \"Ilia\", the Rec Deck unoccupied but for a pair of wary SECURITY GUARDS at a very discreet dis- tance. They are near the pictures of the five Enter- prises, which should be FEATURED in this SHOT, as Decker waves his hand about the huge room. \nDECKER The carbon units use this area for recreation... (carefully) What type of recreation does the crew aboard your vessel enjoy...? \n268   CLOSER TWO SHOT (PICTURES O.S.)                            268 \n", "test3_id": 2267}

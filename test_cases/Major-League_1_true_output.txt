Brown is lost in thought at his desk. Vaughn appears at the door like a boy expecting a spanking. 
BROWN C'mon in, Rick. 
Vaughn comes in and takes a seat. He's worried. 
BROWN Rick, I'm not gonna beat around the bush here. You got a great arm, one of the best I've ever seen, but your control hasn't come around like we hoped it would. 
Vaughn nods contritely. 
BROWN Now, there are a lotta pitchers that started out wild and, after workin' it out in the minors, for a while, went on to great careers. (pointing to a picture on the wall) Take Sandy Koufax there... 
Vaughn looks at the picture on the wall. He squints slightly. Brown notices it. 
VAUGHN What about Koufax? 
BROWN Never mind Koufax. 
Brown quickly prints some big letters on a legal pad and goes to stand about fifteen feet from Vaughn. 
BROWN Read these letters, starting at the top. 
Vaughn balks a second and then concentrates on the pad, squinting. Unsettled, he squints harder. He even tries closing one eye. 
BROWN Can't read it, can you? 
Vaughn shakes his head no. 
VAUGHN You gonna send me to the minors? 
BROWN Nope.

INT. CLEVELAND LOCKER ROOM - NIGHT 
Taylor, Hayes, Vaughn and the others are dressing out for the game. Vaughn is wearing his glasses. 
VAUGHN These things make me look ridiculous. 
TAYLOR Drop in the bucket, Vaughn. 
Meanwhile, Cerrano is sharpening a long knife at his locker. 
VAUGHN What's that for? 
CERRANO Gin and cigarettes not enough for Jo- Buu. I still can no hit curva ball for sheet. I hafta make a sacrifice to him. 
TAYLOR Sacrifice? You mean like something living? 
CERRANO Si. I kill unborn children. 
HARRIS Not while I'm here you're not. That's murder. 
Cerrano pulls the unborn chicken out of his pocket -- a common store bought egg. Harris is a little embarrassed at his outburst. 
Cerrano touches the egg to his forehead, then places it on his altar. In one swift motion he slams the knife down on it, cutting it into two perfect halves. Taylor and the others are agape at a knife sharp enough to do this. As the yolk spreads out on the altar, Brown emerges from his office. 
BROWN All right, let's hit the field. 
The locker room quickly empties, leaving one man behind -- Harris. He looks around to make sure everyone is gone, then tiptoes over to Cerrano's locker. Screwing up his courage, he picks up Jo-Buu's cup of gin. 
HARRIS Here's looking at ya, Jo-Buu. 
He bolts it down, then backs into the middle of the room, waiting at the ready, as if half-expecting a bolt of lightning. When nothing happens, he gloats at the fetish doll in triumph. 
HARRIS 
strutting out of the dugout, feeling like a million bucks. As he emerges onto the field, a Hitter in the batting cage swings and misses, the bat slipping out of his hands. Away it flies, whirling off down the third base line in a wide arc. It hits Harris in the back of the head and knocks him cold. 
CUT TO: 
HARRIS 
watching the game from the dugout, a zip-lock baggie full of ice-cubes strapped to his head. 
DOYLE (V.O.) We're in the ninth, two down, man on first and the Indians clinging to a one run lead. VAUGHAN, one out away from his first major league victory... 
OMIT

She rushes to him, CAMERA PANNING WITH HER. JEAN-LOUIS stands looking at some stamps. SYLVIE grabs him. 
SYLVIE Jean-Louis -- les timbrés -- où sont- ils? 
Smiling, JEAN-LOUIS holds up an enormous sack of assorted stamps -- hundreds of them. 
SYLVIE Oh, zut! (calling) Reggie -- Reggie -- ! 
REGGIE runs up and joins them. 
REGGIE Jean-Louis -- thank heavens! Do you have -- ! (spotting the sack of stamps) What's that? 
JEAN-LOUIS A man traded with me -- all those for only four. 
REGGIE Oh no! What man, Jean-Louis --  where? 
JEAN-LOUIS looks in one direction, then in the other, trying to remember. 
SYLVIE Vite, mon ange -- vite! 
JEAN-LOUIS Là bas -- Monsieur Félix. 
They all run off down the line of booths. JEAN-LOUIS stops and points off. 
JEAN-LOUIS Il est là! 
MED. SHOT -- STAMP BOOTH 
Closed, deserted, empty. 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE, SYLVIE AND JEAN-LOUIS 
JEAN-LOUIS But he is gone. 
REGGIE I don't blame him. Jean-Louis -- do you know where this Monsieur Félix lives? 
JEAN-LOUIS No -- but I will ask. 
He goes to the closest booth and shakes the coat sleeve of the proprietor. 
JEAN-LOUIS Monsieur Théophile -- 
THÉOPHILE Oui, jeune homme? 
JEAN-LOUIS Monsieur Félix, où habite-il? 
THÉOPHILE A Montmartre -- demande à Monsieur August au Bar des Artistes -- Place Blanche. 
JEAN-LOUIS Merci, Monsieur Théophile. (returning to REGGIE and SYLVIE) He says to ask Monsieur August at the -- 
Before he can finish, SYLVIE, who has heard THÉOPHILE, has JEAN-LOUIS by the hand, dragging him off at full speed, REGGIE right alongside. 
DELETED 
INT. FÉLIX'S ROOM -- DUSK 
A bare, unkempt little room. FÉLIX, a man in his sixties, sits at a table, smoking a pipe. There are stamps and albums everywhere. He holds a magnifying glass in his hand, busy studying something on the table. There is a KNOCK. He looks up. Another KNOCK. 
FÉLIX Entrez. 
The door opens and REGGIE, followed by SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS, enters. 
REGGIE Monsieur Félix -- ? 
FÉLIX (without looking up) I was expecting you. You are American too, of course. 
REGGIE (looking at SYLVIE) Yes. 
FÉLIX The man who bought them last week was American. I did not see him but I heard. I knew you would come. 
He gestures for REGGIE to come closer. Together with SYLVIE and JEAN-LOUIS, she goes to the table and looks at the stamps. 
FÉLIX Look at them, Madame. 
INSERT -- STAMPS 
Four of them -- a red, a yellow, a blue, and a green, still attached to the portion of the torn envelope. 
FÉLIX (O.S.) Have you ever, in your entire life, seen anything so beautiful? 
MED. SHOT -- REGGIE, FÉLIX, SYLVIE AND JEAN-LOUIS 
REGGIE I'm -- I'm sorry -- I don't know anything about stamps. 
FÉLIX I know them as one knows his own face, even though I have never seen them. This yellow one -- a Swedish four shilling -- called 'De Gula Fyraskillingen' -- issued in 1854. 
REGGIE How much is it worth? 
FÉLIX The money is unimportant. 
REGGIE I'm afraid it is important. 
FÉLIX (shrugging) In your money, perhaps $65,000. 
REGGIE Do you mind if I sit down? (she sits) What about the blue one? 
FÉLIX It is called 'The Hawaiian Blue' and there are only seven left. In 1894 the owner of one was murdered by a rival collector who was obsessed to own it. 
REGGIE What's its value today? 
FÉLIX In human life? In greed? In suffering? 
REGGIE In money. 
FÉLIX Forty-five thousand. 
REGGIE (to SYLVIE) Do you have anything to eat? (to FÉLIX) And the orange one -- what about the orange one? 
FÉLIX A two-penny Mauritius -- issued in 1856. Not so rare as the others -- $30,000 perhaps. 
REGGIE And the last one? 
FÉLIX The best for the last -- le chef- d'oeuvre de la collection. The masterpiece. It is the most valuable stamp in the world. It is called 'The Gazette Guyanne.' It was printed by hand on colored paper in 1852 and marked with the initials of the printer. (looking at it through the glass) Today it has a value of $100,000. (a pause) Eh, bien -- I am not a thief. I knew there was some mistake. Take them. 
REGGIE (hesitating) You gave the boy quite a lot of stamps in return, Monsieur Félix -- are they for sale now? 
FÉLIX (looking at the large bag) Let me see. There are 350 European, 200 Asian, 175 American, 100 African and twelve Princess Grace commemorative -- which comes to nine francs fifty. 
REGGIE (fishing money from her purse) Here's ten.

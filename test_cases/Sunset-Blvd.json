Finally I located that agent of mine, the big faker.  Was he out digging up a job for poor Joe Gillis? Hmph! He was hard at work in Bel Air, making with the golf clubs. \nGillis hangs up with a curse, opens the door of the booth, emerges, wiping the sweat from his forehead. He walks toward the exit.  He is stopped by the voice of \nSKOLSKY Hello, Gillis. \nGillis looks around.  At the fountain sits Skolsky, drinking a cup of coffee. \nGILLIS Hello, Mr. Skolsky. \nSKOLSKY Got anything for the column? \nGILLIS Sure.  Just sold an original for a hundred grand.  The Life of the Warner Brothers.  Starring the Ritz Brothers.  Playing opposite the Andrew Sisters. \nSKOLSKY (With a sour smile) But don't get me wrong -- I love Hollywood. \nGillis walks out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA-14    THE BEL AIR GOLF LINKS \nOn a sun-dappled green edged with tall sycamores, stands Morino, the agent, a caddy and a nondescript opponent in the background.  Gillis has evidently stated his problem already. \nMORINO So you need three hundred dollars? Of course, I could give you three hundred dollars.  Only I'm not going to. \nGILLIS No? \nGILLIS I just put my car in the garage. I had a blow-out.  I thought -- \nMAX Go on in. \nThere is authority in the gesture of his white- gloved hand as he motions Gillis inside. \nGILLIS Look, maybe I'd better take my car -- \nMAX Wipe your feet! \nAutomatically, Gillis wipes his feet on an enormous shabby cocoanut mat. \nMAX You are not dressed properly. \nGILLIS Dressed for what? \nTHE WOMAN'S VOICE Max!  Have him come up, Max! \nMAX (Gesturing) Up the stairs! \nGILLIS Suppose you listen just for a minute - \nMAX Madame is waiting. \nGILLIS For me?  Okay. \nGillis enters. \nA-31    INT. NORMA DESMOND'S ENTRANCE HALL \nIt is grandiose and grim.  The whole place is one of those abortions of silent-picture days, with bowling alleys in the cellar and a built-in pipe organ, and beams imported from Italy, with California termites at work on them.  Portieres are drawn before all the windows, and only thin slits or sunlight find their way in to fight the few electric bulbs which are always burning. \nGillis starts up the curve of the black marble staircase.  It has a wrought-iron rail and a worn velvet rope along the wall. \nMAX (From below) If you need help with the coffin call me. \nThe oddity of the situation has caught Gillis' imagination.  He climbs the stairs with a kind of morbid fascination.  At the top he stops, undecided, then turns to the right and is stopped by \nWOMAN'S VOICE This way! \nGillis swings around. \nNorma Desmond stands down the corridor next to a doorway from which emerges a flickering light.  She is a little woman.  There is a curious style, a great sense of high voltage about her.  She is dress- ed in black house pyjamas and black high-heeled pumps.  Around her throat there is a leopard-pat- terned scarf, and wound around her head a turban of the same material.  Her skin is very pale, and she is wearing dark glasses. \nNORMA In here.  I put him on my massage table in front of the fire.  He always liked fires and poking at them with a stick. \nGillis enters the SHOT and she leads him into \nA-32    NORMA DESMOND'S BEDROOM \nIt is a huge, gloomy room hung in white brocade which has beconle dirty over the years and even slightly torn in a few places.  There's a great, unmade gilded bed in the shape of a swan, from which the gold had begun to peel.  There is a disorder of clothes and negligees and faded photographs of old-time stars about. \nIn an imitation baroque fireplace some logs are burn- ing.  On the massage table before it lies a small form shrouded under a Spanish shawl.  At each end on a baroque pedestal stands a three-branched cande- labrum, the candles lighted. \nNORMA I've made up my mind we'll bury him in the garden.  Any city laws against that? \nGILLIS I wouldn't know. \nNORMA I don't care anyway.  I want the coffin to be white.  And I want it specially lined with satin. White, or deep pink. \nShe picks up the shawl to make up her mind about the color.  From under the shawl flops down a dead arm. Gillis stares and recoils a little.  It is like a child's arm, only black and hairy. \nNORMA Maybe red.  bright flaming red. Gay.  Let's make it gay. \nGillis edges closer and glances down.  Under the shawl he sees the sad, bearded face of a dead chimpanzee.  Norma drops back the shawl. \nNORMA How much will it be?  I warn you - don't give me a fancy price just because I'm rich. \nGILLIS Lady.  you've got the wrong man. \nNORMA The wind gets in that blasted pipe organ.  I ought to have it taken out. \nGILLIS Or teach it a better tune. \nNorma has led him to the card tables which stand side by side near a window.  They are piled high with papers scrawled in a large, uncertain hand. \nNORMA How long is a movie script these days?  I mean, how many pages? \nGILLIS Depends on what it is -- a Donald Duck or Joan or Arc. \nNORMA This is to be a very important picture.  I have written it myself.  Took me years. \nGILLIS (Looking at the piles of script) Looks like enough for six impor- tant pictures. \nNORMA It's the story or Salome.  I think I'll have DeMille direct it. \nGILLIS Uh-huh. \nNORMA We've made a lot of pictures together. \nGILLIS And you'll play Salome? \nNORMA Who else ? \nGILLIS Only asking.  I did't know you were planning a comeback. \nNORMA I hate that word.  It is a return. A return to the millions of people who have never forgiven me for deserting the screen. \nGILLIS Fair enough. \nNORMA Salome -- what a woman! What a part! The Princess in love with a Holy man.  She dances the Dance of the Seven Veils.  He rejects her, so she demands his head on a golden tray, kissing his cold, dead lips. \nGILLIS They'll love it in Pomona. \nNORMA (Taking it straight) They will love it every place. (She reaches for a batch of pages from the heap) Read it.  Read the scene just before she has him killed! \nGILLIS Right now?  Never let another writer read your stuff.  He may steal it. \nNORMA I am not afraid.  Read it! \nNORMA (Cont'd) (Calling) Max!  Max! (To Gillis) Sit down.  Is there enough light? \nGILLIS I've got twenty-twenty vision. \nMax has entered. \nNORMA Bring something to drink. \nMAX Yes.  Madame. \nHe leaves.  Norma turns to Gillis again. \nNORMA I said sit down. \nThere is compulsion in her voice. \nGillis looks at her                   GILLIS' VOICE and starts slowly          Well.

There is a little pause. \nNORMA (Impatiently) Well? \nGILLIS This is fascinating. \nMax pushes open a door at the top of the stairs. \nMAX (Opening the door) I made your bed this afternoon. \nGILLIS Thanks. (On second thought) How did you know I was going to stay, this afternoon? \nMax doesn't answer.  He walks across to the bed, screws a bulb in the open socket above it.  The light goes on, revealing: \nA-37    A GABLED BEDROOM \nThere are dirty windows on two sides, and dingy wall- paper on the cracked plaster walls.

As in the door to the room above the garage, this lock, too, has been gouged out. \nGILLIS Hey, what's this with the door? There isn't any lock. \nMAX There are no locks anywhere in this house. \nHe points to the entrance door of the room, and to another door. \nGILLIS How come? \nMAX The doctor suggested it. \nGILLIS What doctor? \nMAX Madame's doctor.  She has moments of melancholy.  There have been some suicide attempts. \nNORMA You know, this floor used to be wood but I had it changed. Valentino said there is nothing like tiles for a tango. \nShe opens her arms. \nGILLIS Not on the same floor with Valentino! \nNORMA Just follow me. \nThey start to tango.  After a moment -- \nNORMA Don't bend back like that. \nGILLIS It's those feathers.  They tickle. \nNorma pulls the paradise feathers from her hair and tosses them away. \nC-7     THE ORCHESTRA \nAs they play the tango, the musicians eye the danc- ing couple, take in the situation, exchange glances and turn away with professional discretion. \nC-8     NORMA AND GILLIS, TANGOING \nGillis glances at his wrist watch. \nGILLIS It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here? \nNORMA Who? \nGILLIS The other guests? \nNORMA There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me. \nGILLIS I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold. \nNORMA Hold me tighter. \nGILLIS Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head? \nNORMA You think this is all very funny. \nGILLIS A little. \nNORMA Is it funny that I'm in love with you? \nGILLIS What's that? \nNORMA I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along. \nThey dance on.  Gillis is acutely embarrassed. THE CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, PANS past the faces of the musicians, who play on with a rather overe- mphasized lack of interest.  Finally it winds up on Max, behind the buffet.  He stands watching Gillis, a faint trace of pity in his eyes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nC-9     NORMA'S FINGER, WITH THE CIGARETTE GADGET, as she          GILLIS' VOICE inserts a cigarette.        I'm sure a lot of you will laugh about this.  Ridicu- lous situation, wasn't it? -- a woman almost twice my age ...  It got to be about a quarter of eleven.  I felt caught, like a cig- arette in the prongs of that contraption on her finger. PULL BACK TO: \nNORMA AND GILLIS sitting on a couch in front of the cavernous fireplace.  Norma holds out her cigarette to Gillis, who lights it. \nNORMA. What a wonderful next year it's going to be.  What fun we're going to have.  I'II fill the pool for you.  Or I'll open my house in Malibu, and you can have the whole ocean.  Or I'll buy you a boat and we'll sail to Hawaii. \nGILLIS Stop it.  You aren't going to buy me anything more. \nNORMA Don't be silly. (She reaches under a pillow of the couch and brings out a leather box) Here.  I was going to give it to you at midniglht. \nGillis opens the box.  It contains a matched gold cigarette case and lighter. \nNORMA Read what's inside. \nGillis snaps open the case.  Engraved inside the cover is: TO JOE FROM NORMA, and two bars of music. \nGILLIS What are the notes? \nC-19    ARTIE GREEN'S APARTMENT \nIt is the most modest one-room affair, jam packed with young people flowing over into the miniature bathroom and the microscopic kitchenette.  The only drink being served is punch from a pressed-glass bowl -- but everybody is having a hell of a time. Most of the men are in slacks and sweaters, and only a few of the girls in something that vaguely suggests party dress. \nAbe Burroughs sits at a small, guest-festooned piano and sings Tokio Rose.  By the door, a group of young men and girls respond to the song by sing1ng Rinso White or Dentyne Chewing Gum or something similar, in the manner of a Bach choral.  Artie Green, a dark haired, pleasant-looking guy in his late twenties, is conducting with the ladle from the punch bowl. \nThe door behind some of the singers is pushed open, jostling them out of their places.  In comes Gillis, his hair and face wet, the collar of his Vicuna coat turned up.  Artie stops conducting, but the commer- cial goes right on. \nARTIE Well, what do you know ! Joe Gillis ! \nGILLIS Hi, Artie. \nARTIE Where have you been keeping that gorgeous face of yours? \nGILLIS In a deep freeze. \nARTIE I almost reported you to the Bureau of Missing Persons. (To the company) Fans, you all know Joe Gillis, the well-known screen writer, opium smuggler and Black Dahlia suspect. \nGillis greets some of the kids by name as he and Artie push their way into the room. \nARTIE Give me your coat. \nGILLIS Let it ride for a while. \nARTIE You're going to stay, aren't you? \nGILLIS That was the general idea. \nARTIE Come on. \nArtie starts peeling the coat off Gillis.  Its texture takes his breath away. \nARTIE What is this - mink? \nHe has taken the coat.  He looks at Gillis standing there in tails. \nARTIE Judas E. Priest, who did you borrow that from? Adolphe Menjou? \nGILLIS Close, but no cigar. \nGillis stands embarrassed While Artie rolls up the Vicuna coat and tucks it above the books on a book- shelf. \nARTIE Say, you're not really smuggling opium these days,  are you? \nGILLIS Where's the bar? \nThe two make their way toward the punch bowl.  It's a little like running the gauntlet for Gillis.  There are whistles and 'stares of astonishlnent at his tails. When they reach the punch bowl, Artie picks up a half-filled glass and fills it. \nGILLIS Good party. \nARTIE The greatest.  They call me the Elsa Maxwell of the assistant directors. (To some guests who are dipping their empty cups into the punch bowl) Hey, easy on the punch bowl.  Budget only calls for three drinks per extra. Fake the rest. \nGILLIS Listen, Artie, can I stick around here for a while? \nARTIE Sure, this'll go on all night. \nGILLIS I mean, could you put me up for a couple of weeks? \nARTIE It just so happens we have a vacancy on the couch. \nGILLIS I'll take it. \nARTIE I'll have the bell-hop take care of your luggage. \nHe runs his finger across the decollete back of a girl standing in a group next them. \nARTIE Just register here. \nThe girl turns around.  She is Betty Schaefer. \nGILLIS I had a teacher like that once. \nBETTY Maybe that's why it's good. It's true, it's moving.  Now why don't you use that character... \nGILLIS Who wants true? Who wants moving? \nBETTY Drop that attitude.  Here's some- thing really worth while. \nGILLIS Want me to start right now? Maybe there's some paper around. \nBETTY I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas. \nGILLIS I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little? \nBETTY As for instance? \nGILLIS Well.... \nBETTY We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower? \nGILLIS How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door? \nBETTY Are you hungry? \nGILLIS Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder -- \nBETTY Phillip, you're mad! \nOne of the girls who was on the phone comes to the door. \nGIRL You can have the phone now. \nGILLIS (Paying no attention) Thirsting for the coolness of your lips - \nBETTY No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now. \nGILLIS O.K. (He gets up, starts out, turns) I find I'm terribly afraid of losing you. \nBETTY You won't. (She takes the glass out of his hand) I'll get us a refill of this awful stuff. \nGILLIS You'll be waiting for me? \nBETTY With a wildly beating heart. \nGILLIS Life can be beautiful! \nHe leaves. \nC-21    THE MAIN ROOM \nGillis squeezes himself through some guests to the phone.  He has to stand in a cramped position, holding the instrument close to him as he dials a number. \nGILLIS Max?  This is Mr. Gillis. I want you to do me a favor. \nC-22    NORMA DESMOND HOUSE \nMax is at the phone, in the lower hall. \nMAX I am sorry, Mr.  Gillis. I cannot talk now. \nC-23    GILLIS ON THE PHONE \nGILLIS Yes you can.  I want you to get my old suitcase and I want you to throw in my old clothes -- the ones I came with, and my typewriter.  I'll have somebody pick them up. \nC-24    MAX AT THE PHONE \nMAX I have no time to talk.  The doctor is here. \nC-25    GILLIS ON THE PHONE \nC-31    LIVING ROOM, THE DESMOND HOUSE \nThe candles burned down, the orchestra playing to the emptiness.  The orchestra leader looks at his watch, rises, silences the orchestra, then starts them in on Auld Lang Syne. \nC-32    INT. NORMA'S ROOM \nGillis still stands.  Norma lies on the bed, arms over her eyes, sobbing. \nGILLIS Happy New Year. \nNorma continues to sob.  Gillis goes to the bed, puts his arms on her shoulders and turns her around. \nGILLIS Happy New Year. \nNorma looks at him, tears in her eyes.  Slowly she enfolds him in her bandaged arms. \nNORMA Happy New Year.  darling. \nShe kisses him. \nDISSOLVE \nEND OF SEQUENCE \"C\" \nSEQUENCE \"D\" \nDISSOLVE IN ON: \nD-1     INT. HALLWAY, NORMA              GILLIS' VOICE DESMOND'S HOUSE (DAY)       Around the middle of May some incidents happened The telephone is heard      which I think I should tell ringing.  Max comes from    you about. living room to the phone, picks it up. \nMAX Hello ... Yes? \nD-1a    BETTY SCHAEFER, AT THE PHONE ON HER DESK IN THE READERS' DEPARTMENT \nBETTY Is this Crestview 5-1733? ... I'm sorry to bother you again, but I've confirmed the number.  I must speak to Mr. Gillis. \nD-1b    MAX, AT THE PHONE \nMAX He is not here. \nD-1c    BETTY ON THE PHONE \nBETTY Where can I reach him?  Maybe somebody else in the house could tell me. \nD-1d    MAX ON THE PHONE \nMAX Nobody here can give you any information.  You will please not call again. \nHe hangs up.  From off comes: \nNORMA'S VOICE Who was it, Max?  What is it? \nD-1e    PATIO, NORMA'S HOUSE \nIt is a sunny day.  The garden is in somewhat better shape.  The old house looks less unkept.  The pool is filled.  Norma sits on a wicker chaise longue, her face shielded by an enormous straw hat, her eyes by dark glasses.  Gillis, in bathing trunks, is on a rubber mattress in the pool.  Max comes to the entrance door. \nMAX Nothing, Madame.  Somebody Inqu- iring about a stray dog.  We must have a number very similar to the pound. \nHe starts to turn back. \nNORMA Wait a minute.  I want you to get out the car.  You're going to take the script over to Paramount and deliver it to Mr. De Mille in person. \nMAX Yes, Madame. \nHe goes into the house. \nGILLIS (climbing out of the water) You're really going to send it to De Mille? \nNORMA This is the right day. \nBETTY Sheldrake likes that angle about the teacher. \nGILLIS What teacher? \nBETTY Dark Windows.  I got him all hopped up about it. \nGILLIS You did? \nBETTY He thinks it could be made into something. \nGILLIS Into what? A lampshade? \nBETTY Into something for Barbara Stan- wyck.  They have a commitment with Barbara Stanwyck. \nARTIE Unless you'd rather have Sarah Bernhardt. \nBETTY This is on the level.  Sheldrake really went for it. \nGILLIS O.K.  Where's the cash? \nBETTY Where's the story? I bluffed it out with a few notions of my own. It's really just a springboard. It needs work. \nGILLIS I was afraid of that. \nBETTY I've got twenty pages of notes. I've got a pretty good character for the man. \nARTIE Could you write in plenty of back- ground action, so they'll need an extra assistant director? \nBETTY Shut up, Artie. (To Gillis) Now if we could sit down for two weeks and get a story. \nGILLIS Sorry, Miss Schaefer, but I've given up writing on spec. \nBETTY I tell you this is half sold. \nGILLIS As a matter of fact.  I've given up writing altogether. \nMax has appeared in the door. \nMAX Mr. Gillis, if you please. \nGILLIS Right with you. \nMax leaves. \nARTIE The accent! I've got it: this guy is in the pay of a foreign government. Get those studs.  Get those cuff-links. \nGILLIS I've got to run along.  Thanks any- way for your interest in my career. \nBETTY It's not your career -- it's mine. I kind of hoped to get in on this deal.  I don't want to be a reader all my life.  I want to write. \nGILLIS Sorry if I crossed you up. \nBETTY You sure have. \nGILLIS So long. \nHe leaves. \nARTIE (Patting her hand) Babe, it's like that producer says: In life, you've got to take the bitter with the sour. \nD-6     THE ISOTTA, PARKED OUTSIDE \nGillis comes from Schwab's, gets into the car. \nMax takes off. \nNORMA What on earth, darling? It took you hours. \nGILLIS I ran into some people I knew. \nShe is in full makeup,             GILLIS' VOICE with a veil, a daring     About three days later she hat, a suit so stunning   was good and ready.

So she put on plaid suit.  Max is       about half a pound of driving.                  makeup, fixed it up with a veil, and set forth to see deMille in person. \nNorma is examining her face in the mirror of her vanity.  Max, while driving, sees her in the rear view mirror. \nMAX If you will pardon me, Madame. The shadow over the left eye is not quite balanced. \nNORMA Thank you, Max. \nWith a handkerchief, she corrects it. \nD-9     MAIN GATE, EXT. PARAMOUNT STUDIO \nThe car drives down Bronson and stops smack in front of the iron gate.  A young policeman is talking to an extra; an old policeman sits reading a newspaper. Max sounds the horn impatiently. \nYOUNG POLICEMAN Hold that noise! \nMAX To see Mr. de Mille.  Open the gate. \nYOUNG POLICEMAN Mr. deMille is shooting.  You got an appointment? \nMAX No appointment is necessary.  I am bringing Norma Desmond. \nYOUNG POLICEMAN Norma Who? \nNorma has rolled down the window on her side.  She calls to the old policeman. \nNORMA Jonesy! Come here, Jonesy! \nOLD POLICEMAN Yeah? (He comes forward slowly) Why, if it isn't Miss Desmond! How have you been, Miss Desmond? \nNORMA Fine, Jonesy.  Now open that gate. \nOLD POLICEMAN Sure, Miss Desmond. (To the young policeman} Come on, Mac. \nYOUNG POLICEMAN They can't drive on the lot without a pass. \nOLD POLICEMAN Miss Desmond can.  Come on. \nThey fling open the gate. \nOLD POLICEMAN (As the car drives through) Stage eighteen, Miss Desmond. \nNORMA Thank you, Jonesy.  And teach your friend some manners.  Tell him without me he wouldn't have any job, because without me there wouldn't be any Paramount Studio. (To Max) Go on. \nThey drive through the gates.  The old policeman goes to wall phone beside the gate, dials a number. \nOLD POLICEMAN (Into phone) Norma Desmond coming in to see Mr. deMille. \nD-10    STAGE 18 \nA scene from SAMPSON AND DELILAH is being rehearsed in the background.  The usual turbulent activity surrounds it: extras.  makeup men, grips, assistants, etc., etc.  In the dim foreground a stage hand is answering a stand telephone.  He puts down the phone and moves (CAMERA WITH HIM) to a second assistant. \nSTAGE HAND Norma Desmond is coming to see Mr. deMille. \nThe second assistant walks (CAMERA WITH HIM) to the first assistant. \n2nd ASSISTANT Norma Desmond coming in to see Mr. deMille. \nThe first assistant (CAMERA WITH HIM) hurries to the set.  Sitting with his back toward us is C.B. himself.  He is rehearsing a scene with Hedy Lamarr. \n1ST ASSISTANT Norma Desmond is coming in to see you, Mr. deMille. \nC. B. turns his head. \nDEMILLE Norma Desmond? \nlst ASSISTANT She must be a million years old. \nDEMILLE I hate to think where that puts me.  I could be her father. \nGillis sits on the desk. \nGILLIS I mean it.  It's no good to me anyway.  Help yourself. \nBETTY Why should you do that? \nGILLIS If you get a hundred thousand for it, you buy me a box of chocolate creams.  If you get an Oscar, I get the left foot. \nBETTY You know, I'd take you up on that in a minute.  I'm just not good enough to do it all by myself. \nGILLIS What about all those ideas you had? \nBETTY See if they make sense.  To begin with, I think you should throw out all that psychological stuff -- exploring a killer's sick mind. \nGILLIS Psychopaths sell like hotcakes. \nBETTY This story is about teachers -- their threadbare lives, their struggles.  Here are people doing the most important job in the world, and they have to wprry about getting enough money to re-sole their shoes.  To me it can be as exciting as any chase, any gunplay. \nGILLIS Check. \nBETTY Now I see her teaching day classes while he teaches night school.  The first time they meet ... \nFrom below comes the SOUND of the Isotta's horn. \nGILLIS Look, if you don't mind, I haven't got time to listen to the whole plot ... \nBETTY I'll make it short. \nGILLIS Sorry.  It's your baby now. \nBETTY I'm not good enough to write it alone.  We'll have to do it together. \nGILLIS I'm all tied up.  I can't. \nBETTY Couldn't we work in the evenings? Six o'clock in the morning? This next month I'm completely at your disposal.  Artie is out of town. \nGILLIS What has Artie to do with it. \nBETTY We're engaged. \nGILLIS Good for you.  You've got yourself the best guy in town. \nBETTY I think so.  They're on location in Arizona, shooting a Western. I'm free every evening, every week- end.  If you want, we could work at your place. \nGILLIS It's just impossible. \nBETTY Nobody can be that busy. \nThere is another honk: from down below. \nGILLIS Look, Betty, It can't be done. It's out. \nBETTY You're tough, all right. \nGILLIS You're on your own.  Stop being chicken-hearted and write that story. \nBETTY Honest to goodness, I hate you. \nGILLIS (Turning 1n the open door) And don't make it too dreary.  How about this for a situation: she teaches daytimes.  He teaches at night.  Right?  They don't even know each other, but they share the same room.  It's cheaper that way.  As a matter of fact, they sleep in the same bed -- in shifts, of oourse. \nBETTY Are you kidding? Because I think it's good. \nGILLIS So do I. \nBETTY Came  on back.  Let me show you where it fits in. \nShe reaches in a drawer for her notes on Dark Windows. \nGILLIS (At the door) So long. \nE-3     NORMA BEFORE THE MIRROR IN HER BEDROOM \nIt is nine o'clock in the evening.  She is in night gown and negligee and has put triangular patches on the saddle of her nose and at the outer corner of each eye.  She is rubbing lotion on her hands. \nShe gets up and crosses to the door of Gillis' room and opens it a crack. \nNORMA Joe darling, are you there? \nE-4     GILLIS' ROOM \nIt is dark except for a lamp over the chaise longue. Gillis lies on it, fully clothed, reading a book. \nGILLIS Yes, Norma. \nThrough the slit in the door there is a suggestion of Norma. \nNORMA Don't turn around.  Keep your eyes on the book. \nGILLIS Yes, Norma. \nNorma pushes the door open and comes in. \nNORMA I just came to say good night. I don't want you to see me -- I'm not very attractive. \nGILLIS Good night. \nNORMA I've lost half a pound since Tuesday. \nGILLIS Good. \nNORMA I was a little worried about the line of my throat.  This woman has done wonders with it. \nGILLIS Good. \nNORMA You'd better get to bed yourself. \nGILLIS I think I'll read a little. \nNORMA You went out last night, didn't you, Joe? \nGILLIS Why do you say that? \nNORMA I just happen to know it.  I had a nightmare and I screamed for you.  You weren't here.  Where were you? \nGILLIS I went for a walk. \nNORMA No you didn't.  You took the car. \nGILLIS All right, I drove to the beach. Norma, you don't want me to feel I'm locked up in this house? \nNORMA Of course not, Joe.  It's just that I don't want to be left alone. Not now, while I'm under this terrible strain.  My nerves are being torn apart.  All I ask is for you to be a little patient and a little kind. \nGILLIS I haven't done anything, Norma. \nNORMA Of course you haven't.  I wouldn't let you. \nShe bends and kisses the top of his head. \nNORMA Good night, my darling. \nShe goes into her room, shutting the door behind her. \nGillis puts his book down and looks at her door. \nE-5     THE DOOR TO NORMA'S ROOM \nThe light can be seen through the gouged-out keyhole.  It goes out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nDISSILVE TO: \nE-11    AN EMPTY STREET AT THE                GILLIS' VOICE PARAMOUNT STUDIO (NIGHT)      Sometimes when we got stuck we'd make a Gillis and Betty are walking  litte tour of the down it.

All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid. \nGILLIS What were you -- a child actress? \nBETTY I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe. \nGILLIS Second generation, huh? \nBETTY Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting. \nGILLIS (Examining her nose by the flame of his lighter) Nice job. \nBETTY Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars. \nGILLIS Saddest thing I ever heard. \nBETTY Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader... \nGILLIS Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings... \nBETTY Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun. \nGILLIS Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours. \nBETTY If you please. \nGillis kisses her nose.  As he stands there, his face close to hers - \nGILLIS May I say you smell real special. \nBETTY It must be my new shampoo. \nGILLIS That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway? \nBETTY Twenty-two. \nGILLIS That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.  Now may I suggest that if we're ever to finish this story you keep at least two feet away from me ...  Now back to the typewriter. \nThey start walking in the direction of the office. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nE-13    THE GARAGE \nGillis gets out.  From the seat next him he takes a batch of script, folds it and puts it in his pocket. He suddenly becomes aware that he is watched, turns. Max stands in the moonlight, evidently waiting for him. \nGILLIS What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours? \nMAX You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching. \nGILLIS How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it? \nMAX I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night... \nGILLIS Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what. \nMAX It's just that I'm very worried about Madame. \nGILLIS Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out? \nMAX She never will.  That is my job. It has been for a long time.  You must understand I discovered her when she was eighteen.  I made her a star.  I cannot let her be destroyed. \nGILLIS Stop crying.  You're getting married.  That's what you've always wanted. \nBETTY I don't want it now. \nGILLIS Why not? Don't you love Artie? \nBETTY Of course I love him.  I always will.  I'm just not in love with him any more. \nGILLIS What happened? \nBETTY You did. \nThere is a moment's pause before he takes her in his arms.  THE CAMERA MOVES AWAY. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nE-19    HALL AND STAIRCASE                  GILLIS' VOICE DESMOND HOME- (NIGHT)        It wasn' t until I got back to that peculiar Gillis enters, closes        prison of mine that I the door as quietly as       started facing the facts. he can, and goes up          There it was -- Betty the stairs.

Gillis enters the shot and stands listening. \nNORMA'S VOICE Is this Gladstone 0858? \nE-21    NORMA'S BEDROOM Norma lies in bed, dialing a number.  She has the beauty patches at the corners of her eyes and over her nose. \nNORMA Can I speak to Miss Betty Schaefer? She must be home by now. \nE-22    A BEDROOM IN BETTY'S FLAT \nConnie, a girl of Betty's age with whom she shares the flat, is on the phone.  Betty, in a dressing- gown, comes from the bathroom, toothbrush in hand. \nCONNIE (Hand over mouthpiece) Betty, here's that weird-sounding woman again. \nBETTY What is this anyway? (Taking the phone) This is Betty Schaefer. \nE-23    NORMA AT IHE PHONE \nNORMA Miss Schaefer, you must forgive me for calling you so late, but I really feel it's my duty.  It's about Mr. Gillis.  You do know Mr. Gillis? ...Exactly how much do you know about him? Do you know where he lives? Do you know how he lives? Do you know what he lives on? \nE-24    BETTY AT THE PHONE \nBETTY Who are you? What do you want? What business is it of yours anyway? \nE-25    NORMA ON THE PHONE \nNORMA Miss Schaefer, I'm trying to do you a favor.  I'm trying to spare you a great deal of misery.  Of course you may be too young to even suspect there are men of his sort... \nNORMA (Cont'd) I don't know what he's told you, but he does not live with relatives, nor with friends, in the usual sense of the word.  Ask him ... Ask him again. \nDuring the latter part of her call, the doors from Gillis' room have been pushed open and Gillis has walked towards her.  Suddenly Norma senses his pre- sence and turns around.  The telephone freezes in her hand.  She tries to hang it up.  Very calmly Gillis takes the receiver from her hand. \nGILLIS (Into phone) That's right, Betty, ask me again. This is Joe. \nE-26    BETTY ON THE PHONE \nBETTY Joe, where are you? What's this all about? \nE-27    GILLIS ON THE PHONE \nNorma beside him. \nGILLIS Or maybe it would be a better idea if you came over and saw it for yourself.  The address is 10086 \nHe hangs up.  Norma looks up at him as he crosses to the other end of the room and stands staring at her. The silence becomes unbearable. \nNORMA Don't hate me, Joe.  I did it because I need you.  I need you as I never needed you.  Look at me.  Look at my hands, look at my face, look under my eyes.  How can I go back to work if I'm wasting away under this torment? You don't know what I've been through these last weeks.  I got myself a revolver. You don't believe me, but I did, I did! I stood in front of that mirror, only I couldn't make myself.  It wouldn't be \nNORMA (Cont'd) fair to all those people who are waiting to see me back on the screen.  I can't disappoint them. Only, if I'm to work, I need sleep, I need quiet, I need you! Don't just stand there hating me! Shout at me, strike me! But don't hate me, Joe.  Don't you hear me, Joe? \nGILLIS Yes, I hear you.  And I wish you'd keep still so I can hear the doorbell when she rings it. \nE-28    BETTY AND CONNIE, DRIVING IN A SMALL COUPE DOWN (NIGHT) \nGILLIS Jealous.  Ever see so much junk? She had the ceiling brought from Portugal.  Look at this. \nHe pulls the rope, showing the projection screen under the picture. \nGILLIS Her own movie theatre. \nBETTY I didn't come here to see a house. What about Norma Desmond? \nGILLIS I'm trying to tell you.  This is an enormous place.  Eight master bedrooms.  A sunken tub in every bathroom.  There's a bowling alley in the cellar.  It's lonely here, so she got herself a companion. A very simple set-up: An older woman who is well-to-do.  A younger man who is not doing too well ... Can you figure it out yourself? \nBETTY No. \nGILLIS All right.  I'll give you a few more clues. \nBETTY No, no! I haven't heard any of this.  I never got those telephone calls.  I've never been in this house ... Get your things together. Let's get out of here. \nGILLIS All my things? All the eighteen suits, all the custom-made shoes and the eighteen dozen shirts, and the cuff-links and the platinum key- chains, and the cigarette cases? \nBETTY Come on, Joe. \nGILLIS Come on where? Back to a one-room apartment that I can't pay for? Back to a story that may sell and very possibly will not? \nBETTY If you love me, Joe. \nGILLIS Look, sweetie -- be practical. l've got a good thing here. A long-term contract with no options. I like it that way.  Maybe it's not very admirable.  Well, you and Artie can be admirable. \nBETTY Joe, I can't look at you any more. \nGILLIS Nobody asked you to. \nBetty turns from him, to hide the fact that she is crying. \nGILLIS All right, baby.  This way out. \nHe leads her in the direction of the door. \nE-33    UPPER LANDING, DESMOND HOUSE \nSitting crouched behind the balustrade is Norma, peering down into \nE-34    THE LOWER HALL \nBetty and Gillis have reached the entrance door. Gillis opens it. \nGILLIS Good luck to you, Betty.  You can finish that story on the way to Arizona.  When you and Artie get back, if the two of you ever feel like a swim, here's the pool ... \nHe switches on the light. \nE-35    THE PATIO \nThe lights go on in the pool, which shines brilliant- ly in the dark garden. \nE-36    BETTY \nShe doesn't even look.  Her eyes filled with tears, she runs down the entrance porch toward her car. \nE-37    THE ENTRANCE HALL \nGillis looks after her, closes the door.  From the upper landing comes the sound of soft sobbing.  He looks up. \nE-38    NORMA, ON THE UPPER LANDING \nGillis ascends the stairs. \nNORMA Thank you, Joe -- thank you, Joe. \nShe tries to take his hand to kiss it as he passes. He doesn't stop.  Norma catches his coat.  Gillis moves right on into his room.  Norma lies on the floor looking after him.  She crawls toward a con- sole, pulls herself up by it, starts towards Gillis' door, passes a mirror, realizes how she looks, moves back to the mirror and takes the patches off her face and does a hasty job of removing the cream with her handkerchief, readjusts her expression to a poor travesty of a smile and goes to the door of Gillis' room. \nNORMA May I come in?  I've stopped cry- ing.  I'm all right again.  Joe, tell me you're not cross -- tell me everything is just as it was, Joe. \n", "test1_input": "Sunset Boulevard \nSUNSET BOULEVARD \nCharles Brackett Billy Wilder D.M.

There are a couple of worn-out plush chairs and a Spanish-style, wrought-iron standing lamp.  Also a small desk littered with books and letters, and a chest of drawers with a portable phonograph and some records on top.  On the walls are a couple of repro- ductions of characterless paintings, with laundry bills and snapshots stuck in the frames.

On the walls are some large framed photographs of Paramount stars, with dedications to Mr. Sheldrake.  Also a couple of framed critics' awards certificates, and an Oscar on a bookshelf.  A shooting schedule chart is thumb-tacked into a large bulletin board.  There are piles or scripts, a few pipes and, somewhere in the background, some set models. \nStart on Sheldrake.  He is about 45.  Behind his wor- ried face there hides a coated tongue.  He is en- gaged in changing the stained rilter cigarette in his Zeus holder. \nSHELDRAKE All right, Gillis.  You've got five minutes.  What's your story about? \nGILLIS It's about a ball player, a rookie shortstop that's batting 347.  The poor kid was once mixed up in a hold- up.  But he's trying to go straight -- except there's a bunch of gamblers who won't let him. \nSHELDRAKE So they tell the kid to throw the World Series, or else, huh? \nGILLIS More or less.  Only for the end I've got a gimmick that's real good. \nA secretary enters, carrying a glass or milk. She opens a drawer and takes out a bottle of pills for Sheldrake. \nSHELDRAKE Got a title? \nGILLIS Bases Loaded.  There's a 4O-page outline. \nSHELDRAKE (To the secretary) Get the Readers' Department and see what they have on Bases Loaded. \nThe secretary exits.  Sheldrake takes a pill and washes it down with some milk. \nGILLIS They're pretty hot about it over at Twentieth, but I think Zanuck's all wet.  Can you see Ty Power as a \nGILLIS (cont'd) shortstop?  You've got the best man for it right here on this lot. Alan Ladd.  Good change of pace for Alan Ladd.  There's another thing: it's pretty simple to shoot.  Lot of outdoor stuff.  Bet you could make the whole thing for under a million.  And there's a great little part for Bill Demarest.

Dressed in tweed skirt, Brooks sweater and pearls, and carrying a folder of papers.  She puts them on Sheldrake's desk, not noticing Gillis, who stands near the door. \nBETTY Hello, Mr. Sheldrake.  On that Bases Loaded.  I covered it with a 2-page synopsis. (She holds it out) But I wouldn't bother. \nSHELDRAKE What's wrong with it? \nBETTY It's from hunger. \nSHELDRAKE Nothing for Ladd? \nBETTY Just a rehash of something that wasn't very good to begin with. \nSHELDRAKE I'm sure you'll be glad to meet Mr. Gillis.  He wrote it. \nBetty turns towards Gillis, embarrassed. \nSHELDRAKE This is Miss Kramer. \nBETTY Schaefer.  Betty Schaefer.  And right now I wish I could crawl into a hole and pull it in after me. \nGILLIS If I could be of any help... \nBETTY I'm sorry, Mr. Gillis, but I just don't think it's any good. I found it flat and banal. \nGILLIS Exactly what kind of material do you recommend?  James Joyce? Dostoosvsky? \nSHELDRAKE Name dropper. \nBETTY I just think pictures should say a little something. \nGILLIS Oh, you're one of the message kids.  Just a story won't do. You'd have turned down Gone With the Wind. \nSHELDRAKE No, that was me.  I said, Who wants to see a Civil War picture? \nBETTY Perhaps the reason I hated Bases Loaded is that I knew your name. I'd always heard you had some talent. \nGILLIS That was last year.

There are golden spangles in her hair and in her hand she carries a golden scarf. \nThe police clear a path for her to descend.  Press cameras flash at her every step. \nMax stands at the cameras. \nMAX Is everything set up, gentlemen? \nCAMERAMAN Just about. \nThe portable lights flare up and illuminate the staircase. \nMAX Are the lights ready? \n"}

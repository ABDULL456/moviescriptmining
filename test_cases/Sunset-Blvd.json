After a moment -- \nNORMA Don't bend back like that. \nGILLIS It's those feathers.  They tickle. \nNorma pulls the paradise feathers from her hair and tosses them away. \nC-7     THE ORCHESTRA \nAs they play the tango, the musicians eye the danc- ing couple, take in the situation, exchange glances and turn away with professional discretion. \nC-8     NORMA AND GILLIS, TANGOING \nGillis glances at his wrist watch. \nGILLIS It's a quarter past ten.  What time are they supposed to get here? \nNORMA Who? \nGILLIS The other guests? \nNORMA There are no other guests.  We don't want to share this night with other people.  This is for you and me. \nGILLIS I understand some rich guy bought up all the tickets for a perfor- mance at the Metropolitan and sat there listening to La Traviata, all by himself.  He was afraid of catching cold. \nNORMA Hold me tighter. \nGILLIS Come midnight, how about blind- folding the orchestra and smash- ing champagne glasses on Max's head? \nNORMA You think this is all very funny. \nGILLIS A little. \nNORMA Is it funny that I'm in love with you? \nGILLIS What's that? \nNORMA I'm in love with you.  Don't you know that? I've been in love with you all along. \nThey dance on.  Gillis is acutely embarrassed. THE CAMERA SLOWLY PULLS BACK, PANS past the faces of the musicians, who play on with a rather overe- mphasized lack of interest.  Finally it winds up on Max, behind the buffet.  He stands watching Gillis, a faint trace of pity in his eyes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nC-9     NORMA'S FINGER, WITH THE CIGARETTE GADGET, as she          GILLIS' VOICE inserts a cigarette.        I'm sure a lot of you will laugh about this.  Ridicu- lous situation, wasn't it? -- a woman almost twice my age ...  It got to be about a quarter of eleven.  I felt caught, like a cig- arette in the prongs of that contraption on her finger. PULL BACK TO: \nNORMA AND GILLIS sitting on a couch in front of the cavernous fireplace.  Norma holds out her cigarette to Gillis, who lights it. \nNORMA. What a wonderful next year it's going to be.  What fun we're going to have.  I'II fill the pool for you.  Or I'll open my house in Malibu, and you can have the whole ocean.  Or I'll buy you a boat and we'll sail to Hawaii. \nGILLIS Stop it.  You aren't going to buy me anything more. \nNORMA Don't be silly. (She reaches under a pillow of the couch and brings out a leather box) Here.  I was going to give it to you at midniglht. \nGillis opens the box.  It contains a matched gold cigarette case and lighter. \nNORMA Read what's inside. \nGillis snaps open the case.  Engraved inside the cover is: TO JOE FROM NORMA, and two bars of music. \nGILLIS What are the notes? \n", "test1_true": "GILLIS Norma, I can't take it.  You've bought me enough. \nNORMA Shut up.  I'm rich.  I'm richer than all this new Hollywood trash. I've got a million dollars. \nGILLIS Keep it. \nNORMA I own three blocks downtown. I have oil in Bakersfield -- pumping, pumping, pumping.

Do you want me to tell you? \nGILLIS Has it ever occurred that I may have a life of my own? That there may be some girl I'm crazy about? \nNORMA Who? Some car hop, or a dress extra? \nGILLIS Why not? What I'm trying to say is that I'm all wrong for you. You want a Valentino -- somebody with polo ponies -- a big shot -- \nNORMA (Getting up slowly) What you're trying to say is that you don't want me to love you.  Is that it? \nGillis doesn't answer.  Norma slaps his face and rushes from the room and upstairs. \nGillis stands paralyzed, the slap burning his cheek. \nC-1O    THE TOP OF THE STAIRCASE AND CORRIDOR \nNorma rushes up the last few steps, down the corridor and into her bedroom, banging the door.  MOVE THE CAMERA toward the closed door, centering on the gouged-out lock. \nC-11    GILLIS, IN THE BIG ROOM \nHe still stands motionless.  He glances around fur- tively, to see if his humiliation has been observed. \nC-12    THE ORCHESTRA \nThe musicians are playing away.  They have turned their eyes away from Gillis rather too ostentatious- ly for comfort. \nC-13    GILLIS \nHis eyes move over toward \nC-14    MAX \nHe is subtler than the musicians.  He appears very busy at the buffet, putting empty bottles and used glasses on a tray.  He walks across the room with them. \nC-15    GILLIS \nHe starts slowly out.  As he does so his long gold key chain catches on a carved ornament of the sofa and holds him for a second of additional embarrass- ment.  He yanks it loose and walks with as much nonchalance as he can muster to \nC-16    THE HALL \nCrossing towards the coat closet, Gillis throws a look upstairs.  Then he pulls the Vicuna coat from its hangar and slips into it as he crosses to the entrance door.  He opens the door on the darkness of the courtyard. \nC-17    EXT.

Maybe there's some paper around. \nBETTY I'm serious.  I've got a few ideas. \nGILLIS I've got some ideas myself.  One of them being this is New Year's Eve.  How about living it up a little? \nBETTY As for instance? \nGILLIS Well.... \nBETTY We could make some paper boats and have a regatta.  Or should we just turn on the shower? \nGILLIS How about capturing the kitchen and barricading the door? \nBETTY Are you hungry? \nGILLIS Hungry? After twelve years in the Burmese jungle.  I am starving, Lady Agatha -- starving for a white shoulder -- \nBETTY Phillip, you're mad! \nOne of the girls who was on the phone comes to the door. \nGIRL You can have the phone now. \nGILLIS (Paying no attention) Thirsting for the coolness of your lips - \nBETTY No, Phillip, no.  We must be strong.  You're still wearing the uniform of the Coldstream Guards!  Furthermore, you can have the phone now. \nGILLIS O.K.

He has to stand in a cramped position, holding the instrument close to him as he dials a number. \nGILLIS Max?  This is Mr. Gillis. I want you to do me a favor. \nC-22    NORMA DESMOND HOUSE \nMax is at the phone, in the lower hall. \nMAX I am sorry, Mr.  Gillis. I cannot talk now. \nC-23    GILLIS ON THE PHONE \nGILLIS Yes you can.  I want you to get my old suitcase and I want you to throw in my old clothes -- the ones I came with, and my typewriter.

Betty elbows her way up to him, carrying the two punch glasses filled again. \nBETTY I just got the recipe: take two packages of cough drops, dissolve in one gallon of lukewarm grape juice -- \nGillis looks up at her.  Without a word he pushes her aside so that she spills the drink.  He makes his way through the guests to the Vicuna coat, pulls it from the shelf, some books tumbling with it, and rushes towards the door and out.  Betty stands look- ing after him, completely bewildered. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nC-28    EXT. DESMOND HOUSE - (NIGHT, RAIN) \nThe doctor's car is parked in the driveway.  A taxi pulls up.

NORMA DESMOND'S ROOM \nOnly one alabaster lamp lights the big, cold room. On the bed lies Norma in her evening dress.  She is white as a sheet.  Her wrists are bandaged.  Her eyes are wide open, staring at the ceiling.  One of her shoes has halt slipped off her foot.  The other is on.  Gillis opens the door and stands there tor a second.  Then he slowly moves to the toot of the bed. He takes the shoes from her feet and puts them on the floor. \nNORMA Go away. \nGILLIS What kind of a silly thing was that to do? \nNORMA To fall in love with you -- that was the idiotic thing. \nGILLIS It sure would have made attractive headlines: Great Star Kills Her- self for Unknown Writer. \nNORMA Great stars have great pride. \nShe puts one bandaged forearm over her eyes, sobbing. Gillis walks slowly over to the mantelpiece, stands there for awhile. \nNORMA Go away.  Go to that girl of yours. \nGILLIS Look, I was making that up because I thought the whole thing was a mistake.  I didn't want to hurt you. You've been good to me.  You're the only person in this stinking town that has been good to me. \nNORMA Why don't you just say thank you and go, go, go -- \nGILLIS Not until you promise to act like a sensible human being. \nNORMA I'll do it again, I'll do it again, I'll do it again! \nGillis stands looking at her helplessly. \n", "test2_id": 2626, "test3_input": "DISSILVE TO: \nE-11    AN EMPTY STREET AT THE                GILLIS' VOICE PARAMOUNT STUDIO (NIGHT)      Sometimes when we got stuck we'd make a Gillis and Betty are walking  litte tour of the down it.

All card- board, all hollow, all phoney. All done with mirrors.  I like it better than any street in the world.  Maybe because I used to play here when I was a kid. \nGILLIS What were you -- a child actress? \nBETTY I was born just two blocks from this studio.  Right on Lemon Grove Avenue.  Father was head elec- trician here till he died.  Mother still works in Wardrobe. \nGILLIS Second generation, huh? \nBETTY Third.  Grandma did stunt work for Pearl White.  I come from a picture family.  Naturally they took it for granted I was to become a great star.  So I had ten years of dramatic lessons, diction, dancing. Then the studio made a test.  Well, they didn't like my nose -- it slanted this way a little.  I went to a doctor and had it fixed.  They made more tests, and they were crazy about my nose -- only they didn't like my acting. \nGILLIS (Examining her nose by the flame of his lighter) Nice job. \nBETTY Should be.  It cost three hundred dollars. \nGILLIS Saddest thing I ever heard. \nBETTY Not at all.  It taught me a little sense.  I got me a job in the mail room, worked up to the Stenographic. Now I'm a reader... \nGILLIS Come clean, Betty.  At night you weep for those lost closeups, those gala openings... \nBETTY Not once.  What's wrong with being on the other side of the cameras? It's really more fun. \nGILLIS Three cheers for Betty Schaefer! I will now kiss that nose of yours. \nBETTY If you please. \nGillis kisses her nose.  As he stands there, his face close to hers - \nGILLIS May I say you smell real special. \nBETTY It must be my new shampoo. \nGILLIS That's no shampoo.  It'smore like a pile of freehly laundred hand- kerchiefs, like a brand new auto- mobile.  How old are you anyway? \nBETTY Twenty-two. \nGILLIS That's it -- there's nothing like being twenty-two.

Now back to the typewriter. \nThey start walking in the direction of the office. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nE-13    THE GARAGE \nGillis gets out.  From the seat next him he takes a batch of script, folds it and puts it in his pocket. He suddenly becomes aware that he is watched, turns. Max stands in the moonlight, evidently waiting for him. \nGILLIS What is it, Max? Want to wash the car, or are you doing a little spying in your off hours? \nMAX You must be very careful as you cross the patio.  Madame may be watching. \nGILLIS How about my going up the kitchen stairs and undressing in the dark. Will that do it? \nMAX I'm not inquiring where Mr. Gillis goes every night... \nGILLIS Why don't you? I'm writing a script and I'm dying to finish it, no matter what. \nMAX It's just that I'm very worried about Madame. \nGILLIS Sure you are.  And we're not help- ing her any, feeding her lies and more lies.  Getting herself ready for a pioture ...  What happens when she finds out? \nMAX She never will.  That is my job.

What's wrong? \nBETTY He wants me to come on to Arizona. He says it only oosts two dollars to get married there.  It would kind of save us a honeymoon. \nGILLIS Why don't you?

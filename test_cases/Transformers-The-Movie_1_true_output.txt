PERCEPTOR (V.O.) Most unscientific, but... effective. 
EXT THE SPACE BATTLE 
As the Quintesson ship shoots toward Unicron's face. 
THE CRUISER Is suddenly struck by a ray from Unicron's eye, and half of it is knocked off. 
INT THE CRUISER 
Lights go off, and the Autobots are thrown around like toys. 
ANGLE THROUGH THE VIEWSCREEN 
They are heading right to Unicron's eye. 
ANGLE ON UNICRON AND THE CRUISER 
Unicron swipes at the cruiser, but misses. The Cruiser crashes right through Unicron's eye like a corkscrew! 
UNICRON (V.O.) Graaaaaaaaaaa! 
INT. UNICRON'S HEAD - SAME TIME 
The cruiser rips through the eye socket and smashes through several electrical membranes that are, in fact, Unicron's brain. 
ANGLE ON THE SHIP 
As the ship tumbles through, it dumps off the various Autobots like rubbish and disintegrates. 
ANGLE ON HOT ROD 
He tumbles out of the rubbish and down a deep pit (which we can assume is a robotic sinus or something) 
EXT. THE BRAIN AREA 
Kup, Springer, Daniel and Arcee are scattered about the floor in the giant, flickering chamber. 
DANIEL Where's Hot Rod? 
SPRINGER Sees something in the distance. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SPRINGER I don't know, but I hope they didn't get him. 
WHAT HE SEES 
Are dozens of hovering Robots that look like floating bear traps, snapping their jaws as they drift slowly towards the Autobots. 
ANGLE ON THE AUTOBOTS 
KUP Debugoids! 
ARCEE Quick!   This way. 
They run into a long, cave-like chamber which looks like the central nervous system or something. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANOTHER CHAMBER - LATER 
Hot Rod drops through the darkness and lands in a pile of miscellaneous junk. 
ON HOT ROD 
He slowly gets up and looks around the chamber. 
WHAT HE SEES 
Pan as Hot Rod looks over various different bits of junk, until he sees the glowing shape of the Autobot Matrix apparently suspended in mid air. 
HOT ROD The Autobot Matrix! 
Then, suddenly two red, burning eyes light up above the matrix, and we see the hideous form of Galvatron. 
GALVATRON It will do you no good, Autobot.   It cannot be opened. 
ON HOT ROD 
He stands up and walks towards Galvatron. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HOT ROD Not by a Decepticon. 
ANGLE ON HOT ROD AND GALVATRON

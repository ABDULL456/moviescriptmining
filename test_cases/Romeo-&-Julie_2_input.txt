EXT. MONUMENT. AFTERNOON. 
Away, below the outstretched arms of Christ, lights from emergency vehicles pulse red through the downpour. 
THE CAMERA: Falls through heavy rain toward a woman crouched over the lifeless body of Tybalt. 
She cries: 
GLORIA Tybalt! 
Cops nervously eye Fulgencio Capulet and Ted Montague, who, both flanked by body guards, face each other across the crime scene. Medics stand by helplessly as Gloria clings to Tybalt's body. A handcuffed Benvolio looks on. 
GLORIA (CONT.) Tybalt, my cousin, O my brother's child! O, the blood is spilled of my dear kinsman. 
Police lines part as Captain Prince arrives. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE Where are the vile beginners of this fray? 
Benvolio struggles forward. 
BENVOLIO O noble Prince I can discover all The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl. 
Gloria appeals hysterically: 
GLORIA Prince as thou art true, For blood of ours shed blood of Montague! 
CAPTAIN PRINCE Benvolio, who began this bloody fray? 
BENVOLIO (pointing to Tybalt's corpse) There lies the man, slain by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman brave Mercutio. 
Gloria interjects savagely. 
GLORIA He speaks not true! Affection makes him false! 
BENVOLIO Romeo, that spoke him fair, could not take Truce with the unruly spleen of 
TYBALT Deaf to peace! 
GLORIA He is a kinsman to the Montague! I beg for justice which thou Prince must give. Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live! 
Captain Prince turns to Gloria. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio. Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe? 
Ted Montague pleads: 
MONTAGUE Not Romeo, Prince, he was Mercutio's friend; His fault concludes but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt. 
Captain Prince eyes Montague coldly. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE And for that offence Immediately we do exile him. 
Montague, body guards in tow, surges forward. 
MONTAGUE Noble Prince...? 
Prince silences him. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE I will be deaf to pleading and 
EXCUSES; Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses. Therefore use none. 
The Captain turns and addresses his assembled officers. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.) Let Romeo hence in haste, Else, when he is found that hour is his last. 
CLOSE ON: Captain Prince. 
CAPTAIN PRINCE (CONT.) Bear hence this body and attend our will. Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill. 
INT. JULIET'S BEDROOM. AFTERNOON. 
An acoustic guitar version of Joy Division's 'Love Will Tear Us Apart.' Juliet traces the path of a raindrop on the window pane as she speaks her thoughts to the storm. 
JULIET Come gentle night, coming loving black browed night, Give me my Romeo. And when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little stars, And he will make the face of heaven so fine That all the world will be in love with night, And pay no worship to the garish sun. O, I have bought the mansion of a 
LOVE But not possessed it, and though I am sold, Not yet enjoyed. So tedious is this day As is the night before some festival To an impatient child that hath new 
ROBES And may not wear them. 
EXT. CAPULET'S MANSION - DRIVEWAY. AFTERNOON. 
Juliet's P.O.V.: The limousine pulls into the driveway. 
PULL OUT: Of the window and CRANE DOWN: Juliet runs from the room. 
EXT. CAPULET MANSION. AFTERNOON. 
Through the open doorway we see an excited Juliet meet the Nurse at the bottom of the stairs. 
The music surges.

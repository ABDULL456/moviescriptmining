atrick, standing off, sees Derek hurry down the hall and head for the elevator. 
moment later, he sees Lisa come down the hall and rejoin the party. A little tipsy, he walks over to her. 
PATRICK Living dangerously, aren't we? 
LISA Oh, Patrick, you're such an old queen. (THEN) Come on. Dance with me. 
Lisa pulls Patrick out with the other dancers. 
LISA (cont'd) (as they dance; teasing) I 'll bet you've never been this close to an actual woman. 
PATRICK Honey, I've never been this close to an actual man. 
CUT TO: 
INT. YUKON - NIGHT 
Derek drives home. He's agitated, trying to calm down, trying to make sense of what happened. 
That's when he hears a SIREN. Derek's eyes go up to the rear view mirror in panic as a police car with flashing lights gains on him. 
Derek pulls over, heart pounding.   This is all he needs right now. 
The police car flies by on its way to some emergency. 
Derek closes his eyes; lets out a deep breath.

EXT. CHARLES HOUSE - NIGHT 
Swept by headlights as Derek pulls into the drive. 
INT. KYLE'S BEDROOM 
Dark.   Derek looks in on his sleeping son. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM 
Dark. Derek approaches the bed where Beth sleeps.     He slips in beside her. 
BETH (SLEEPY) How was the party? 
DEREK I only stayed for two drinks. 
BETH That dull, huh? 
A long beat.   Derek considers telling her. 
EREK Beth... 
BETH Not tonight, honey, okay?   I'm really tired. 
And Beth is already back asleep. 
Derek lies there, in Hell. He looks up and sees his own dark reflection in the ceiling mirror.                     C UT TO: 
INT. OFFICE - MONDAY MORNING 
Derek gets off the elevator and walks to his office, turns a corner and sees: 
Lisa coming the other way, carrying files. Derek tenses and stops, expecting the worst. Lisa merely gives him a pleasant smile and walks by. 
LISA Good morning. 
DEREK Morning. 
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED: 
Like the other night never happened. Lisa continues on her way, delivering the files to a co-worker. 
erek stands there, observing Lisa, wondering.        Ben appears beside Derek. 
BEN You okay, bro? 
Derek turns, a little startled.        He registers Ben. 
DEREK Yeah.   I'm fine. 
BEN You should have stuck around. 
DEREK What?

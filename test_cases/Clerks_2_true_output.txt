RANDAL Let's hear it. 
DANTE (pause) The milkmaids. 
RANDAL The milkmaids? 
INSERT: MILK HANDLER 
A WOMAN pulls out gallon after gallon, looking deep into the cooler for that perfect container of milk. 
DANTE (O.C.) The women that go through every gallon of milk looking for a later date. As if somewhere-beyond all the other gallons-is a container of milk that won't go bad for like a decade. 
END INSERT 
RANDAL You know who I can do without? I could do without the people in the video store. 
DANTE Which ones? 
RANDAL All of them. 
MONTAGE INSERT #1/VIDEO JERKS 
A series of people addressing the camera, asking the dumb questions. 
FIRST What would you get for a six-year- old boy who chronically wets his bed? 
SECOND (in front of stocked new release shelf) Do you have any new movies in? 
THIRD Do you have that one with the guy who was in that movie that was out last year? 
END INSERT 
RANDAL And they never rent quality flicks; they always pick the most intellectually devoid movie on the rack. 
MONTAGE INSERT #2/"Ooooh!..." 
An identical series of customers finding their ideal choices. 
FIRST Ooooh! Home Alone! 
SECOND Ooooh! Hook! 
THIRD Ooooh! Navy Seals! 
END INSERT 
RANDAL 
It's like in order to join, they have to have an IQ less than their shoe size. 
DANTE 
You think you get stupid questions? You should hear the barrage of stupid questions I get. 
MONTAGE INSERT #3/DUMB QUESTIONS 
A series of people standing in various locations throughout the convenience store, asking truly dumb questions. 
FIRST (holding coffee) What do you mean there's no ice? You mean I've gotta drink this coffee hot?! 
SECOND (holding up item from clearly marked $.99 display) How much? 
THIRD (peeking in door) Do you sell hubcaps? 
END INSERT 
RANDAL See? You vented. Don't you feel better now? 
DANTE No. 
RANDAL Why not? 
DANTE Because my ex-girlfriend is getting married. 
RANDAL Jesus, you got a one-track mind. It's always Caitlin, Caitlin, Caitlin... 
DANTE (jerking head toward door) Veronica! 
DANTE gives RANDAL a shove to shut him up. VERONICA enters the store, carrying books and something covered with aluminum foil. 
VERONICA What happened to home by twelve? 
DANTE is suddenly by her side, taking the books from under her arm. 
DANTE He still hasn't shown up. Why aren't you in class? 
VERONICA Lit 101 got canceled, so I stopped home and brought you some lunch. 
DANTE What is it? 
VERONICA Peanut butter and jelly with the crusts cut off. What do you think it is? It's lasagne. 
DANTE Really? (kisses her forehead) You're the best. 
VERONICA I'm glad you've calmed down a bit. (to RANDAL) Hi, Randal.

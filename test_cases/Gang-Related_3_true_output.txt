WILLIAM I don't know. 
Rodriguez suddenly smacks Joe on the side of the head when he tries to look back. Joe is surprised by the blow. Divinci pushes Rodriguez back. Shakes his head telling him to back off. 
DIVINCI (to Joe; friendly) Come on, we're all tired here, Joe. Just give us your last name. 
WILLIAM I don't remember. 
DIVINCI ...Okay, fine, what's in a name? But you remember the gun, right, in your pocket. 
Joe nods. 
DIVINCI And you remember that you told me you thought he was going to hit you, right? That's why you shot... 
WILLIAM ...Yeah. 
Divinci looks at Rodriguez. Rodriguez nods. 
DIVINCI How'd it happen, Joe, tell me how it happened. (prompting) You saw him driving toward you -- 
WILLIAM -- I saw him driving toward me -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - NIGHT - LIONEL HUDD 
driving. The night that he was shot. He looks ahead into the darkness of the street. Suddenly he SEES -- 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
A MAN standing in the street ahead of him. 
HUDD - INT. CAR - NIGHT 
smiles and turns toward the man in the street. 
A .44 
is pulled from a jacket pocket, lifted toward the APPROACHING CAR. The gun is in the hands of Joe. He is scared. The HEADLIGHTS COMING RIGHT AT HIM. He aims and FIRES the gun. 
THE FRONT WINDOW 
SHATTERS. And the car swerves to the curb. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Joe watches from the street, then looks at the .44 in his hand. 
BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT 
Rodriguez leans into Joe who is now sitting on the edge of the bed, looking down at the .44 in his hand. 
RODRIGUEZ Then what did you do? 
EXT. STREET - NIGHT 
Joe is in the street again. He doesn't know what he did. 
BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM 
Divinci leans close to Joe from behind now. 
DIVINCI You ran. 
And now Joe can imagine it. We PUSH INTO JOE'S EYES. 
BACK TO THE STREET 
as Joe turns and runs. As fast as he can away from the death. He looks back over his shoulder, scared. 
JOE'S VOICE I didn't mean to... 
BACK INSIDE THE MOTEL ROOM 
Joe is staring at the gun. Divinci and Rodriguez watch him. 
WILLIAM He was going to hit me... I was scared... he was going to hit me. 
Rodriguez looks at Divinci. 
DIVINCI That's why you shot him. 
WILLIAM That's why I... 
JOE - BACK ON THE STREET - NIGHT 
AIMS the gun again at the APPROACHING CAR. 
JOE'S VOICE ...shot him. 
And we HEAR the GUN SHOT AGAIN, shattering the silence as we -- 
CUT TO: 
THE SMOKING .44 - INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE - DAY

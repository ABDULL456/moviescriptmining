He takes a step into the road...and then big, gnarled hands grab him. 
GAGE looks rather surprised at this, but not worried--this kid is used to being picked up and treated humanely. To GAGE strangers are as interesting as...well, as interesting as Orinco trucks. 
EXT.  GAGE AND JUD CRANDALL 
The fellow who has picked GAGE up is a man of about eighty in old blue jeans, a faded Bruce Springsteen t-shirt. Over this he wears a faded khaki vest with bright silver buttons. His face is deeply wrinkled and kindly. 
JUD CRANDALL (to GAGE) No you don't, my friend--not in that road. 
But he softens this with a grin. GAGE grins back at him. 
GAGE Drucks! 
JUD (low) No shit, Sherlock. 
JUD carries him up the driveway to the station wagon. Here he's joined by LOUIS and RACHEL, out of breath and really scared. ELLIE brings up the rear. She's still sniffling. 
RACHEL Gage! 
JUD (hands him to her) He was headed for the road, looked like. I corralled him for you, missus. 
RACHEL Thank you. Thank you so much. 
LOUIS Yes--thanks. I'm Louis Creed. 
He sticks out his hand and JUD shakes it. LOUIS takes it easy--no crushing JayCees grip, or anything like that--the old guy looks as if he might have arthritis. 
JUD Jud Crandall. I live just across the road. 
RACHEL I'm Rachel. Thanks again for saving the wandering minstrel boy, here. 
JUD No harm, no foul. But you want to watch out for that road. Those damn trucks go back and forth all day and most of the night. 
He leans over toward ELLIE. 
JUD Who might you be, little Miss? 
ELLIE I'm Ellen Creed and I live at 642 Alden Lane, Dearborn, Michigan. (Pause) At least, I used to. 
JUD And now you live on Route 9 in Ludlow, and your dad's gonna be the new doctor up to the college, I hear, and I think you're going to be just as happy as a clam here, Ellen Creed. 
ELLIE (to LOUIS) Are clams really happy? 
They all laugh--even GAGE. 
RACHEL Excuse me, Mr. Crandall--I've got to change this kid. It's nice to meet you. 
JUD Same here. Come over and visit when you get the chance. 
As RACHEL, carrying GAGE, moves away: 
ELLIE (worries) Daddy, do I really have to have the stingy stuff? 
LOUIS No-I guess not. 
ELLIE Yayyy! 
She goes belting off. 
JUD (amused) I guess your daughter there ain't going to die after all. 
LOUIS (also amused) I guess not. 
JUD House has stood empty for too long. It's damn good to see people in it again. 
SOUND: A truck engine, gearing down. 
EXT.  A MOVING VAN 
It blinks and comes lumbering into the Creed's driveway. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD 
LOUIS Hey--they actually found the place! 
JUD Movin' in's mighty thirsty work. I usually sit out on my porch of an evening and pour a couple of beers over m'dinner. Come on over and join me, if you want. 
LOUIS Well, maybe I---- 
RACHEL (voice) Louis, what's this? 
EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE 
GAGE has been changed, and RACHEL is following him as he explores the nearest edges of the new homestead. They are fairly close to the wreckage of the tire swing, and here is the head of the path ELLIE has already glimpsed. 
EXT.  LOUIS AND JUD 
They cross to the van. The FIRST and SECOND MOVERS are just climbing out of the van. 
FIRST MOVER You Mr. Creed? 
LOUIS Yes. Just a second. 
EXT.  RACHEL AND GAGE, AT THE HEAD OF THE PATH 
She's holding GAGE on her hip now, and both of them are looking at that strange (and oddly enticing) path which disappears into the deepening twilight. LOUIS and JUD join them. 
LOUIS The movers-- 
RACHEL Yes--I know. This path, Louis? Where does it go? 
LOUIS I don't have the slightest idea. When I saw the house, this field was under four feet of snow. 
RACHEL (smiling) I bet Mr. Crandall knows! 
JUD nods. He smiles, too, but underneath the smile we sense that he is serious. 
JUD Oh, ayuh! I know. It's a good story, and a good walk, too. I'll take you up there sometime, and tell you the story, too-- after you get settled in. 
He smiles at them and they smile back--it is a look of understanding and real liking, in spite of the age difference between the CREEDS and JUD. 
EXT.  THE CREED HOUSE  NIGHT 
SOUND: Crickets. Ree--ree--ree-ree... 
There's one light upstairs, one downstairs. Perhaps we see the path, glimmering away into the field? Either by virtue of it being mown, or by virtue of some gentle optical trick? Maybe. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM  NIGHT 
There's a light on in the kitchen, but it just casts a dim glow in here. The room has a fireplace and a lovely wooden floor. It's going to be nice, but now it's just a big bare box with movers' cartons stacked all over the place. 
LOUIS is drinking a can of Pepsi, and he looks pretty damned tired--anyone who's ever moved house and can remember the first night in the new place will understand.

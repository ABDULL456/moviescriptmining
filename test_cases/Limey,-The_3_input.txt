INT. WAREHOUSE. 
A SUPERVISOR (the one from the flash cuts) does a double take as Wilson passes. 
SUPERVISOR Hey! 
Wilson stops and turns.  Says nothing. 
SUPERVISOR How'd you get in here. 
WILSON Walked. 
SUPERVISOR You walked. (coming over) What the hell are you doing here. 
WILSON Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him? 
MEAT PUPPETS (who we saw before as well) who work here gathering.  The Supervisor and the Meat Puppets exchange glances. 
SUPERVISOR He's expecting you? 
WILSON (beat) I doubt it. 
The Supervisor moves toward Wilson. 
SUPERVISOR So why would he want to see you. 
WILSON I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson. 
SUPERVISOR Jennifer Wilson. 
More looks are exchanged. 
WILSON You know her? 
SUPERVISOR Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now. 
Wilson stares at him. 
WILSON Is Valentine here? 
SUPERVISOR What do you think? 
Wilson looks at the Meat Puppets, the loading area. 
WILSON Where is he, then? 
SUPERVISOR Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions? 
Wilson just looks at him. 
SUPERVISOR Do you hear me, asshole? 
The Supervisor shoves him.  The Meat Puppets move a little in anticipation.  Wilson isn't giving any indication that he's going to leave. 
SUPERVISOR Jesus, you really want your ass kicked, don't you? 
He pushes Wilson again, hard. 
SUPERVISOR Go on, get outta here. 
He pushes Wilson again.  Still, Wilson won't leave. 
SUPERVISOR Fuckin' nut.  Go on. 
This time he tries to slap Wilson.  Wilson blocks the Supervisor's hand and then punches him, hard.  The Supervisor stumbles back and falls to the floor. 
THE MEAT PUPPETS 
Move to Wilson.  He tries to fend them off, but there are too many.  They beat him.  When they find that he's armed, they beat him harder. 
CUT. 
EXT. BUILDING.  DAY. 
Wilson is taken outside and dumped.  After a moment, he gets to his feet.  Dusting himself.  Reaches for ANOTHER GUN tucked in his lower back.  He re-enters the building. 
A beat.  We hear several SHOTS. 
Seconds later, one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of the door, terrified.  He runs past us, fast. 
A moment later, Wilson emerges, gun in hand. 
WILSON You tell him.  You tell him I'm coming!!

PARNASSUS looks miserable but, almost relieved.    He turns over the next card. 
It's The Hanged Man. It depicts a body hanging from a gibbet surrounded by several arcane objects. 
PARNASSUS studies the card, trying to wring some meaning from it - then lays The Hanged Man in the space between the others. He takes a swig from the bottle. 
26   EXT   WAGON ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE     NIGHT                 26 
The wagon has stopped in the middle of Blackfriar's bridge. It's pouring with rain. 
VALENTINA, wearing some sort of covering against the rain, climbs out of the hatch and onto the roof of the wagon. 
Here she finds ANTON pointing excitedly down into the Thames. 
ANTON Incredible! I saw somebody d- dancing in the air.. under the b- bridge.. 
VALENTINA looks doubtfully at PERCY who peers morosely out from under his sou-wester and shakes his head. 
ANTON (CONT'D) It's true! There was a sh-shadow on the water, when the lightning flashed... 
(CONTINUED) 
26   CONTINUED:                                                26 
Lightning flashes again. 
We see what ANTON and VALENTINA see. A shadow, on the water, of someone `dancing', hung by his neck with a rope attached to the underside of the bridge. 
ANTON (CONT'D) (triumphant) You see! The d-dancer! 
VALENTINA (horrified) There's someone hanging there! 
ANTON (smugly to Percy) I t-told you! 
VALENTINA A rope! Get a rope! 
27   EXT   SIDE OF BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE      MOMENTS LATER      27 
ANTON is `absailing' over the side of the bridge. One end of a rope is tied around his waist, the other is attached to the bridge parapet. A lantern dangles from his waist. 
VALENTINA and PERCY watch ANTON'S perilous descent. 
Moments later there are two bodies hanging from the bridge, the mysterious HANGING MAN'S and ANTON'S. 
The MAN is hanging by a noose around his neck, still jerking in his dance of death. His hands are tied behind his back. 
ANTON can't reach the MAN. 
ANTON (shouting up) I c-can't reach him. 
VALENTINA Try again! 
PERCY Swing in! 
VALENTINA Hurry up. 
(CONTINUED) 
27   CONTINUED:                                               27 
ANTON shoots PERCY and VALENTINA a jaundiced look and with VALENTINA'S help on her end of the rope begins to swing back and forth. 
Eventually, with a big enough swing, he manages to hook his foot around the HANGING MAN who has gone limp. Dead. 
With extreme difficulty and great discomfort, ANTON pulls the MAN close to him, takes a knife from his pocket and cuts the MAN'S rope. 
ANTON and the MAN are now swinging back and forth together on ANTON'S rope which is threatening to cut ANTON in half. 
ANTON Arghhh!!!! 
VALENTINA You've done it! Brilliant! 
ANTON Argggg!!! 
PERCY Come on, don't hang about! We're getting soaked up here! 
28   EXT   PAVEMENT ON BLACK FRIARS' BRIDGE A LITTLE LATER     28 
VALENTINA, ANTON and PERCY manhandle the MAN over the parapet and onto the pavement. 
DR. PARNASSUS has just stepped out onto the top of the wagon. Soaked. He's drunk and is swaying. 
DR. PARNASSUS Why are you fishing dead people out of the river? He's dead. Leave him. Let's go. Before the police turn up. 
He goes, unsteadily, back inside. 
VALENTINA and ANTON drag the MAN under the wagon, out of the rain. 
The MAN is dressed in an expensive Saville Row suit. His jacket pockets are full of strange weights and arcane symbols have been scrawled on his forehead. He's about 30 years old and very handsome.

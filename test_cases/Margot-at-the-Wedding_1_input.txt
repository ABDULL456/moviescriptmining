INGRID Mom, can you hide this please. 
Pauline puts the record sleeve on top of a shelf. 
PAULINE (for Margot's benefit) Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek once? 
MALCOLM In the late `80's. It was a solo gig after he left the Cars. 
CLAUDE So, you're kind of famous. 
Malcolm reddens. 
MALCOLM No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I used to want to be, but, No. Do you want to be famous? 
MARGOT Claude wants to be very famous. 
MALCOLM Well, make sure you can handle rejection. I can't. For me, expectation just turns to disappointment. So, ultimately I'd rather not try. It'll all go black for us soon enough anyway. 
PAULINE Claude, ignore him. 
Pauline sneaks a look at Margot who is watching Malcolm with an expression of either contempt or confusion. Pauline grows uncomfortable. She says to Claude: 
PAULINE When your mother moved to New York she used to send me books and records. She sent me REM's Murmur... MARGOT And the Pixies. 
PAULINE And X. She was very cool your mother. 
MARGOT You only liked top forty. 
PAULINE Yeah, but I love REM now. 
Margot takes off her reading glasses and rubs her eyes. 
MARGOT I don't really listen to music anymore. 
PAULINE I was dating that guy, Horace back then. Remember him? 
MARGOT Was that the guy who liked to rough you up? 
PAULINE No, that was our dad. 
Pauline and Margot crack up laughing.   Malcolm raises an eyebrow at Claude. 
MARGOT Our father used to strip down to his skivvies and beat us with a belt. 
MALCOLM That man had a sexual screw loose. 
PAULINE It's awful -- that stuff that happens to kids. Malcolm was fondled by a male baby-sitter. MALCOLM Just use that information however you want... PAULINE Sorry. We're with family.     I figured... Claude looks at Malcolm.   Malcolm doesn't meet his eyes. 
PAULINE I think Becky got it the worst. 
MARGOT Did she ever. Raped by the horse trainer... 
Margot breaks into laughter. Pauline spits her seltzer back into the glass. They both laugh hysterically. Tears stream down Margot's face. Claude watches. 
12   EXT. PATIO - NIGHT                                         12 
Malcolm, Pauline, Margot, Claude and Ingrid sit with a homosexual couple, Alan, 40's, and Toby, 30's, and their son, Bruce, 8, at an old wooden table eating crab, salad and soup. Part of Alan's face is paralyzed. 
TOBY Alan rolled over in bed and looked at me and he said I can't feel my face. It took three doctors before we knew it was Bells Palsy. 
ALAN They say a brush of wind can do it. 
TOBY Feeling is slowly coming back.

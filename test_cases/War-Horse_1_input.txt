They all look at Lyons in his suit and bowler hat. 
AUCTIONEER Do I hear twelve guineas? Twelve guineas? 
SI EASTON That's top price for a workin' animal. Ted! Save it for the shire! 
DAD There are big days and there are small days. Which will it be? 
AUCTIONEER Do I hear any advance on eleven guineas? 
All eyes are on Lyons and his son - David is 15, smartly dressed. 
DAVID LYONS Just let him go, dad, I don't care for him, he's too... jumpy. 
Lyons isn't listening to David; he's looking hard at Ted. 
LYONS Shall we say - twenty five? 
The crowd gasps. This is clearly personal. 
SI EASTON Well, he's got you there. Nice try, Ted. 
ANDREW You were great, Mr N. Gave him a run for his money. 
But when he looks at Ted, Ted's eyes are locked into the eyes of his rival. 
AUCTIONEER Going, going... 
DAD Thirty. Thirty guineas! 
Total silence. He stares hard at Lyons. Who simply smiles, raises an eyebrow, tips his hat and walks away. It dawns on Dad that he's won the auction. He breaks into a sweat. 
AUCTIONEER Thirty guineas. Thirty guineas. Going going gone - to Mister Ted Narracott. 
He bangs his gavel. It's a done deal. 
SI EASTON What have you done, Ted? What have you done? 
Dad doesn't acknowledge Si. 
Moments later - Ted stands staring at Joey, who looks back. Ted holds his reins numbly, accepts his receipt from the auction man in a kind of daze. 
Suddenly, Lyons appears at Dad's shoulder. 
LYONS Quite a beast, there. But what you gonna do with him - on a working farm? I hope you got the rent, Ted. I'll be around for it when it comes due. 
Dad does not acknowledge Lyons. Lyons smiles and walks away with son David, and his cronies. Si shakes his head at Dad. 
SI EASTON You're a fool, Ted. And our Rosie'll never forgive you. 
EXT. NARRACOTT'S FARM. SUNSET. 
MRS. NARRACOTT kneels in her garden, digging up some carrots, when she sees Ted returning. 
Dad walks down the hedged lane as the sun sets pulling Joey with him, his bad leg always moving slightly to the side. 
Mrs. Narracott looks in horror and bewilderment at Joey and then at Dad. She is a good-looking, intelligent woman, but clearly her life is always hard. 
MRS. NARRACOTT What have you done? 
Dad stands shamefaced as Albert - the boy we have already met - runs out of the house to join them. 
ALBERT That's Mooney's colt! 
MRS. NARRACOTT You were supposed to buy a plow horse. 
ALBERT You bought him? MRS. NARRACOTT What'd you pay for him? 
Albert is totally taken by the horse. 
MRS. NARRACOTT (CONT'D) How much, Ted Narracott? 
DAD I won't tell you a lie - though I would love to. Thirty guineas.

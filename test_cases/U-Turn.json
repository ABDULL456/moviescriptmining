{"test1_input": "SECOND BIKER The dinero, Senora.  Hand it over. \nBobby shifts his weight trying to hide his pack behind his back. \nThe woman goes to an old-fashioned cash register and rings it open.  She hands the money to the biker. \nBIKER That's it?  Lady, I got kids to put through school. \nWOMAN Es all I have. \nThe biker turns to Bobby. \nBIKER Okay, pal.  Whatcha got? Give it, now. \nBobby pulls a thick wad of cash ($1,000 plus) from his pant pocket, tosses it on the counter. \nBIKER (thumbing through it, impressed) Nice...Just who are you beautiful? What else you got for papa? \nBobby makes a show of pulling out his wallet, flings it to him. \nBIKER Better...you're getting tasty. Now toss the bag, sweetie. \nBOBBY It's just books. \nBIKER I'm a reader. Toss it. \nBOBBY (an entreaty) It's personal things...family things. \nBIKER How touching...I like family values. Give it to me. \nBobby takes an unsteady breath. \nBOBBY No. \nBIKER No? \nSECOND BIKER Hey man, forget it. Come on. \nBIKER No? \nWOMAN Senor, give him the bag. \nBIKER That's all right. He doesn't want to give me the bag... \nSECOND BIKER He's fucking with you man. Shoot him. \nBIKER (cont'd) ...he doesn't have to give me the bag. \nThe biker grabs Bobby's bag. Bobby flinches in anticipation of a shot but refuses to let go of the bag.  The biker swings the gun hard, clipping Bobby across the forehead.  Bobby falls against the counter and to the floor.  The woman starts to scream. The biker grabs up the pack, then, looking back at the woman, sees a ring on her finger.  He grabs her hand and pulls at the ring. The woman screams wildly. \nSECOND BIKER Let's go, man. \nBIKER A little extra never hurt, Benji, would you just relax. \nWOMAN No!  No! My wedding ring. \nHe pulls the ring from the woman's finger and pushes her back. With Bobby's bag slung over his shoulder he turns to leave. \nBIKER Now we go. \nWOMAN You go to El Diablo! \nFrom beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun. The woman fires A SHOT that rips through the bag and into the back of the biker.  He falls to the ground, very dead, amid a shower of blood and shredded money. \nSECOND BIKER Bugger! You bitch! \nThe Second Biker now sees the money floating all over the place out of the torn bag. His eyes go big with greed as he FIRES at the old woman, who ducks behind the counter. \nThe Biker grabs for the bag and what's left of the money, not expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her SECOND BLAST into him and the bag. \nWhatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to shreds along with the bag and the Biker who is very dead. \nBobby is staggered, crawls towards the shreds. \nWOMAN (cursing in Spanish) Hijos de puta. Bayan a comer su propia mierda en el infierno. (TRANSLATION: Sons of bitches. Go eat your own shit in hell). \nShe comes around the counter to his side as he grabs his wallet and the $1000 cash roll from the dead biker's pants. \nWOMAN I call the sheriff. \nBOBBY No! No police. \nBobby gives her a hundred dollars. \n", "test1_true": "Bobby gives her some more cash. She looks at him. Finally he gives her the entire wad. \nBOBBY No police until I leave. \nBobby stumbles from the store as the screen burns a bright white. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. STREET - LATER \nBOBBY, dazed and holding his head, sits on the ground next to a SPIGOT that is dripping water.  He cups his hands under the water and splashes it against his face, lightly wiping the cut above his eye. The SHERIFF'S CAR goes wailing by on the main drag. Recoiling from being spotted, Bobby tries to take another drink. A SCORPION crawls out of the faucet. He jumps back. \nEXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - LATER \nDARRELL is leaning under the hood of a car working on its engine as BOBBY walks up. \nBOBBY Hey. \nDARRELL Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you? \nBOBBY Nothing. \nDARRELL Don't look like nothing. \nBOBBY Just banged my head.  It was an accident. \nDARRELL Another accident?  You got to be more careful. \nBobby rolls his eyes. Then notices the front fenders have been removed. \nBOBBY What the hell happened to my car? \nDARRELL Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now. \nBOBBY (suspicious) How much? \nDARRELL Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks. \nBOBBY How much!? \nDARRELL Hundred-fifty. \nBOBBY To replace a goddamn radiator hose!? \nDARRELL A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose? \nBOBBY About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone. \nDARRELL Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices? \nBOBBY That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford? \nDARRELL \"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.\" \nBOBBY What's that got to do with the radiator hose? \nDARRELL I don't know, but \"it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.\"  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars. \nBOBBY It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money. \nDARRELL Then you ain't gonna have the car. \nBOBBY Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had. \nBobby digs through his bloodied wallet, trying to hide it from Darrell. He fishes out a five dollar bill. Then digs out a bloody one dollar bill from his pocket. \nBOBBY I've got five...six dollars. \nDarrell snatches the five from him and adds it to a thick wad of greasy bills he carries in his overalls. \nDARRELL Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split. \nBOBBY I don't have a goddamn credit card. \nDARRELL Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off. \nBobby proffers his Movado watch. \nBOBBY Look, I got a Movado.  It's worth at least seven, eight hundred. You could sell it for that. \nDARRELL (studying it) Who the hell to? Shit, can't see no numbers. \n", "test1_id": 2619, "test2_input": "JAKE What the hell you looking at, girl? \nGRACE Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing. \nEXT. DESERT - EVENING \nThe SUN is setting. It strikes the horizon sending a ripple of golden light through the sky. \nEXT. PORCH OF HOUSE - EVENING \nA MAN dances in the evening light with a small child in his arms. \nEXT. CORNER OF HOUSE - EVENING \nA DOG and CAT huddle together in sleep. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - EVENING \nSHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER is tossing horseshoes with his DEPUTIES. \nEXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - EVENING \nGRACE watches the sun going down outside her house, cradling herself in her arms. A desert wind gently caresses her. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT \nThe BLIND MAN, along with his dead DOG, sits on the side of the street. \nBLIND MAN Well, that's it.  Sun's going down.  People go home, trade stories over dinner. They'll talk about the day, about the heat, laugh about something crazy it made them do.  They'll kiss, sleep a few hours, then do it all over again. \nBOBBY now appears next to the blind man holding two Dr. Peppers. He hands one to the blind man, takes a sip of the other one, and offers him his own change. \nBOBBY The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right. \nBLIND MAN (giving back the change) Keep it. \nThere's a suggestion of cockiness in Bobby, feeling his luck coming back with the night. His humour is enhanced by his POV down the street: \nAs DARRELL, with his dilapidated truck, readies SERGEI'S convertible for towing. \nBLIND MAN (OVER) Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark. \nBOBBY Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty. \nBLIND MAN Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of. \nBOBBY You afraid of the dark? \nBLIND MAN Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death (he makes a strange sound). It's all the same to me. \nBOBBY So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it? \nBLIND MAN More or less. \nBOBBY Not this twig, friend.  I got plans. \nBLIND MAN Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town. \nBOBBY No and I don't plan on sticking around either. \nBLIND MAN Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way. \nBOBBY You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you. \nThe Blind Man slowly lifts his glasses, showing his EYES at last. Where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh. An ugly sight that even takes Bobby back a step. \nBLIND MAN Used to be a young smartass like you. Then I got smart with the wrong man's daughter. Got some acid poured on my peepers for my trouble. You know human beings ain't always just human -- they got animals living inside 'em too...People give spare change to war heroes not fools. All fools get is pity. May not have eyes, but I see. And you, boy? \nThe Blind Man puts his glasses back on. \nBLIND MAN You got my pity. \nBOBBY (doesn't believe him) Hope she was worth it. \nBLIND MAN Oh, she was worth it.  She was worth every black minute since. \nBobby looks at his watch, gets ready to go, drops a coin into the Blind Man's cup. \nBOBBY Time's up. Any last words of wisdom? \nBLIND MAN Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. Are you a human being -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around? \nBobby walks away, smiling. \n", "test2_true": "BLIND MAN You know I won't be seeing you. \nThe Blind Man lifts his sunglasses and peers into the cup as if he sees. We don't really know. He reaches into the cup and pulls out the coin Bobby tossed in. \nBLIND MAN Cheap bastard. Gives me back my own money... Well, Jesse, time's up, let's go for a walk. \nThe Blind Man now stands up and pulls the seeing-eye dog's harness. The DOG struggles to its feet and they walk off down the street together. \nINT. MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT \nGRACE stands by the back door staring at the bolt lock. JAKE yells to her from another room. \nJAKE(O.C.) What the hell you doin', Grace?  Are you coming to bed, or aren't you? \nFor a moment Grace's hand wavers above the lock.  Suddenly, like a snake striking, her hand shoots out and unlocks the bolt. Just as quickly she turns from the door and heads to the bedroom. \nEXT. YARD - MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT \nA LIGHT is on in the bedroom window.  After a moment it dims and the house is dark, silhouetted against the horizon by moonlight. BOBBY steps into frame, carrying an iron pipe. \nINT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS \nWe start close on GRACE -- a KEY slapping against her buttocks as bedsprings groan.  We reveal Grace copulating on all fours with JAKE from behind. \nJAKE Ya little bitch, you like it don't you! You like it this way -- rough and hard. Gotta go fuck around on me, like your Mama, but you always gotta come home to Daddy, don't you, cause you know Daddy's the best. \nGRACE Yes, yes, hit me...beat me, please. \nJAKE You been a bad girl, Grace. You took my heart from your Mama, didn't ya? You betrayed her! Like you did me. There ain't no forgivin' ya, girl! \nGRACE Oh no! Oh please forgive me, Papa! \nJAKE You broke her heart! You broke your Mama's heart. You stole me! That's right. Fuck it away. But it ain't ever goin' away, cause your Mama -- she's like a hungry ghost baby, she won't go away, she won't leave ya alone. \nGRACE No! No! Please! \nHe hits her. Harder. \nIn a strange flashback of his mind, he now sees Grace's MAMA beneath him, receiving his punishment. \nHe stops, abruptly. He can't go on. Fear coming into his eyes. He starts to whimper, begging for his punishment and/or forgiveness. \nJAKE Oh baby, I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry... (he starts to cry) I didn't mean to hurt you so bad. It just...got away... \nHe drops down, burying his face between Grace's legs. \nJAKE Forgive me, baby, forgive me! \nHe hides there from the world that he has created, crying to himself. \nGrace has an unreadable expression, but that's certainly not a new occurrence in their strange relationship. \nINT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BACKDOOR - NIGHT \nThe knob of the backdoor twists and the door opens.  BOBBY slips quickly through the space and into the house quietly closing the door behind him.  It is nearly pitch dark, and he has no bearings.  He steps gingerly through the hall, but in the darkness he bumps into a table nearly knocking over a lamp only to catch it just before it crashes into the floor. \nINT. MCKENNA HOUSE/BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS \nJAKE hears the noise.  He raises his head and cocks an ear to the air. She knows who it is, and is concerned; he's too early. \nGRACE What's the matter? \nJAKE You didn't hear something? \nGRACE Yeah, I heard a key slapping against my ass. \nJAKE There's someone in the house. \nGRACE (nervous) Maybe...maybe the wind blew something over (encouraging him to continue). Come on baby, keep going. \nJake climbs out of bed, throwing on some pants, reaching into a drawer in the chest of clothes, pulling out a small dark metallic OBJECT. \nGRACE (realizing) What's that? Jake -- where's you get that? \nJAKE Relax baby. Stay here. \nHe goes to the door. She follows, tries to block the door. \nGRACE Jake, don't go out there. Call the sheriff. \nJAKE Shhhh! Just like your Mama, always scared of things... \n", "test2_id": 2620, "test3_input": "GRACE is in a quandary. How many seconds before Bobby walks in to kill her? Or can he really kill her? She's not sure. \nShe looks around the room frantically. Picks up a lamp, puts it down. She looks quickly through her closet, rummages below in the boxes. Suddenly she finds it. \nA dangerous looking Indian HATCHET with a feather hanging off its bindings. It's a formidable piece of iron, quite capable of splitting a skull or impaling flesh. \nGrace hears the footsteps just outside the door. She runs behind the door. \nA moment later, the bedroom door creaks open and BOBBY quietly enters, approaching the bed. We sense the doubt in his eyes as to whether he can kill her. \nIn a reverse POV, Bobby sees the outline of Grace in the bed as victim...closer, closer.  He now lifts the edge of the bedcover but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure. \nHe suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her presence. He spins. \nShe's directly behind him, hatchet raised. His life is in her hands. \nHis eyes, locked in an eternal moment. \nHer eyes, the hatchet. \nSNAP CUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS \nAs JAKE, anxiously torn, waits, there is a LOUD CRASH, followed by SOUNDS of struggle, of murder, of death. Then... \nGRACE Jake! \nIt is a desperate cry for help. Jake can't help himself. He breaks into a roaring run down the hall to save his beloved. \nJAKE Grace!! \nINT. BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS \nJAKE bulls into the bedroom. It's a mess, furniture overturned, sheets and blankets all over the floor. The lights broken. Waiting for him, face down on the floor, is BOBBY'S BODY in a pool of liquid. A broken bottle lies nearby. Bobby's body heaves in its final death throes, and then shudders quiet...  Over there, by the bed, is GRACE, who still clutches the HATCHET. The look on her face is pure shock. \nJAKE Well...looks like you got him, Grace. That's good...that's real good.  He must of slipped past me, but you got him.  Looks like that drifter from this morning.  Got to be careful who you make friends with, sweetheart. \nJake eyes the weapon in Grace's hand. \nJAKE Why don't you put that down? It's all over now.  Put it down. \nGrace eyes the gun in Jake's hand. \nJAKE Go on, girl.  Put it down. \nWhat choice does Grace have?  She lets the hatchet clank to the floor. \nJAKE Aww, that's my Grace:  Not about to let someone get the best of her.  That's what I love about you.  As dangerous as you are unpredictable. \nbehind Jake, the lifeless BOBBY rises up from the floor, very much alive, and clobbers Jake with a golf club. Jake is staggered, but he's one tough old customer as he manages to spin slowly, gun still in one hand, as if to fire. \nBefore he can, Grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and drives it straight into his back. \nHe gurgles, stunned from both sides, but it's like trying to kill Rasputin. He still has the gun as Bobby jumps him from the rear, trying to get his neck in a chokehold. The gun FIRES once, discharging into the wall. The hatchet is ripped from his back. \nGrace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged rodeo-type fight, Jake seeking to dislodge Bobby off his back. An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes. \nFinally the two men go crashing to the ground, rolling around, Bobby maintaining his stranglehold, but calling to her, his hands full. \nBOBBY Grace, goddamit, do something! \nJake's eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale, pleading for help. \nJAKE Grace...? \nShe commits. Jumping into the fray, it's not clear whose side she's really on as the three of them roll across the floor, strangling, biting, hitting, spitting, scratching, gasping. It's a Guignol, but the pressure from Bobby's forearm is taking its toll on Jake. Trying to bite Jake, Grace bites Bobby instead, but then she scratches Jake's face. Jake is grabbing her hard as Bobby chokes him, trying to use her to leverage himself away. But she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on her knees across the floor. \nShe grabs the hatchet. And stands, moving back towards the two men locked on the floor. Bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand, no longer sure which way she'll go. \nJake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping from his mouth, looks at Grace with some inner certainty that she will help him. He gasps the words. \nJAKE Help me, Grace, help... \nGRACE Like you helped her, Jake? \nGrace stands there, deciding, the power of the hatchet in her hands. She raises it suddenly over the two men. \nIt flashes downwards. Deep into the gut of her husband Jake, almost transfixing him to the floor. \nIn the silence that follows, Jake's eyes roll up to meet hers. But all she has for him is a cold, distant stare. \nJake's head drops as the life rushes out of him. Bobby falls back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat. \n", "test3_true": "She doesn't answer, turbulence in her face. He rolls Jake's body off, upset. She may have made it a murder, but he was part of it, and he feels the shift in himself. They're both in new territory, feeling an apartness between them. \nSuddenly JAKE gasps, still alive! It is too much for Bobby. He grabs the hatchet and plunges it down on Jake, silencing him one last time. \nGrace is pushing the bed away from the wall, slipping down on her knees and prying open several floorboards. \nGRACE The money's right here! Get the key! \nBOBBY No! You get it! \nHe doesn't want to get close to Jake. Grace coldly runs over to his corpse, ripping the chain, key and all, from the neck. The action pulls Jake's head up, then she lets it thump back on the floor. She runs back to the floorboards. \nThe top of a thick steel floor safe is revealed. \nBobby watches -- his whole life, it seems, hanging on the outcome. \nWith the key, she opens the safe. Inside are rolled-up bundles of cash -- in hundred dollar denominations. She looks up at him, offering it as she reaches in for more. Bobby also gets down on his hands and knees and grabs more and more, sucked into the fever of freedom, far more money than he lost at the grocery store, overcome now with emotions of fear and freedom. \nThey see each other. \nGRACE Didn't I tell you? \nBOBBY (plunging into the cash) There must be 150, 200 thousand here! Goddamnit Grace, you were right! \nGRACE We done it, Bobby. Oh my God! \nThey laugh excitedly and start kissing, rolling in the stacks of cash, some of which sticks to Bobby's sweating back. The day didn't turn out so bad after all for Bobby. \nGRACE Fuck me baby! \nBOBBY (looking at Jake) What about him? \nGRACE Let him watch. I want him to know what he's missing. \nAs they consummate their violent relationship for the first time, Jake's lifeless eyes watch them. \nEXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER NIGHT \nThe LIGHT in the bedroom window is low candlelight, but we sense something watching them. GRACE's silhouette moves across a window. \nBOBBY now comes out of the house, cautious, walking down the driveway. \nHe stops, thinks, and walks back to open the hood of GRACE'S JEEP. \nHe reaches into the ENGINE and disconnects something, then closes the hood and walks on. \nEXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - NIGHT \nBOBBY walks up to the SHACK near the garage and bangs on the door. A light goes on in the window.  DARRELL shouts out. \nDARRELL (O.C.) What you want? \nBOBBY Open up! \nDARRELL (O.C.) We're closed.  Come back when the sun comes up. \nBobby, in a hurry to get back should Grace pull any tricks, bangs and kicks against the door. Darrell yanks the door wide. \nDARRELL What the hell ... oh, it's you.  Might've figgered. Listen I got a waitress coming over.  What do you want? \nBOBBY I want my car. \nDARRELL You got the money? \nBobby pulls the money from his hip pocket and hands it to Darrell.  The mechanic fingers it suspiciously. \nDARRELL Two-hundred dollars in hundred-dollar bills.  And this morning you was broke. \nBOBBY That's none of your business.  Get the keys. \nDARRELL I don't want no dirty money.  I run an honest business. \nBOBBY Yeah, like Al Capone on tax day. Get the keys? \nDARRELL (pause) Well, there's a $50 overnight storage charge we got to talk about. \nBobby is ready at first to explode, but then just laughs out loud. You got to give it to a guy like Darrell. He holds up a $100 bill. \nBOBBY All I got's a hundred, Darrell. You got change? \nDARRELL No. \n", "test3_id": 2621}

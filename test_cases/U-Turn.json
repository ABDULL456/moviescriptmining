{"train": "\"U Turn\", shooting draft, revised by Richard Rutowski & Oliver Stone \nU-Turn \n(Stray Dogs) \nScreenplay by John Ridley \nand \nRichard Rutowski & Oliver Stone \nNOTE: THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS AND SOME \"OMITTED\" SLUGS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FOR THIS SOFT COPY. \nEXT. SOMEWHERE IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST - DAY \nBEGIN TITLES OVER: \nIt is early morning and already hot.  INSECTS drone, crackle, and scurry for shade.  PRAIRIE DOGS burrow to escape the sun. We can see the heat shimmering off the surface of the Earth. \nOn a dusty highway, a pair of VULTURES dine on a dead coyote. One of them snags an intestine and tugs a few feet of it out of the carcass. \nIn the distance, where a long, dusty road meets the horizon, a small shape appears -- a Sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang convertible, its top down.  Its candy-apple red burns like a brilliant fireball under the sun.  As the car drifts closer, we see steam escaping from under the hood.  Sammi Smith's \"Please Help Me Get Through The Night\" plays on the car's radio. \nINT. BOBBY COOPER'S MUSTANG - DAY \nAt the wheel, ignoring impending disaster, BOBBY COOPER, young, good-looking, fiddles with the RADIO dial, annoyed only to find country stations. He's been driving since noon yesterday and it shows -- along with a heavily-bandaged left hand resting on the steering wheel. He finds something by Pearl Jam or Smashing Pumpkins and he cranks it. He pops a Percodan with his good hand as, in the shimmering distance ahead, he sees black shapes in the road and lays on the horn. \nBOBBY Get off the goddamn road! \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY \nAs the MUSTANG powers by, the VULTURES move off the shoulder, silently watching. \nINT. MUSTANG - DAY \nThe RADIO blares as BOBBY fights to stay awake. His attention is caught by blue and red lights flashing in the oncoming lane. He sits up as the POLICE CAR (SHERIFF POTTER inside) closes quickly. The SIREN starts faintly, then SCREAMS as the cruiser roars past at speed. \nBOBBY Fuck you! \nThere is a loud pop from the front of the Mustang and a thick cloud of steam now pours from the hood. The temperature gauge now starts rising. \nBOBBY No!...Not now!...Shit! \nA couple of SEMIS roar past in the opposite direction, buffetting the Mustang with their air waves. \nEXT. FORK IN THE ROAD - DAY \nThe car rolls into a fork in the road, limping with the droop of an animal that won't make another hundred yards. \nOne sign on the larger road says \"GLOBE\" is 29 miles away. The other sign, on the lesser road, tells us \"SUPERIOR\" is only 2 miles. A third sign confirms his destiny with \"Gas, Food, 1 Mile.\" \nBOBBY seems to have no choice. He aims the car down the lesser road towards \"Superior, Arizona.\" \nEXT. OUTSKIRTS SUPERIOR - DAY \nThe car rattles on its last legs, as BOBBY mutters incantations, noticing a old, ghostlike MINING COMPANY at the base of the mountains overlooking the TOWN. It's deserted now, no one visible, the gates shut, but in its vast, dark bulk, we sense the ancient richness and power of this town. Bobby moves on. \nEXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - DAY \nDown the road from the MINING COMPANY, BOBBY'S CAR pulls into a small GAS STATION, made of weather-beaten wood, its windows long since dusted over. The pumps themselves look to have been manufactured in the early fifties. Above the station is a sign so faded it's barely readable: HARLIN'S. \nBobby gets out of the car and with great care, favoring his bandaged left hand which seems to give him a great deal of pain, he opens the hood. A plume of steam hits him in the face. \nBOBBY Oh shit! \nBobby looks around for someone, anyone.  After a few moments he reaches into the car and blows the horn.  He waits, then blows it again.  From out of the station walks DARRELL - a slow-looking man in coveralls caked with grease and dirty.  He looks the part of a yokel. \nBOBBY You Harlin? \nDARRELL Nope.  Darrell. \nBOBBY Harlin around? \nDARRELL He's up at the Look Out. \nDarrell points a scraggly finger at a plateau in the distance. \nBOBBY Will he be back soon? \nDARRELL Doubt it.  He's dead.  The Look Out's a cemetery. \nBOBBY You own this place? \nBOBBY Now do you mind? I got to get some stuff out of the trunk. \nHe throws the car key to Darrell who takes the hint, spits grotesquely into the dirt, scratches his nuts, and walks back to the shack. \nConcealed by the trunk lid, Bobby pulls out a GUN (a .9mm black Baretta), wrapped in a t-shirt, from the top of the bag. Perhaps we see a flash of green money, lots of it. Sports pages and betting sheets are piled inside. With a look around, Bobby takes the gun and stashes it underneath the rubber mat in the trunk. Briefly we notice a towing ROPE under the mat. There is a small travel bag, from which he peels a fresh bottle of Percodan, quickly taking two, as well as the sports page. \nINT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - DAY \nDARRELL watches out of the darkened office through the front window, as BOBBY slams the trunk and starts walking down the road, with the bag on his shoulder. \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - LATER \nBOBBY walks along a dusty patch of road into town past a sign saying \"SUPERIOR - HOME OF THE GOLDEN DOOR RETIREMENT COMMUNITY.\" As he walks on, a pair of MOTORCYCLERS roar past on their Harleys blanketing him in a cloud of DUST.  He shouts after them, but his words are lost under the whine of the cycle engines. \nEXT. SUPERIOR MAIN STREET - DAY \nBOBBY hits town, such as it is:  The Freeway left here a few years back. There are only a few little stores:  A general store, a catalog outlet, a post office that doubles as a bus depot.  All of them built for the desert heat. The busiest spot in town seems to be the truckstop/diner with a few 18 wheelers parked outside it. \nAt the corner of one street sits an old BLIND MAN dressed in raggedy clothes, perhaps an Indian. His SEEING-EYE DOG lies next to him. He's talking to TWO OLD MEN, veterans perhaps, Indian or Spanish. They both have missing limbs and slide off with furtive alcoholic looks as Bobby passes. The Blind Man yells out in an American Indian accent. \nBLIND MAN Hey!  You there! \nBOBBY You want something, old man? \nBLIND MAN Don't call me old man.  Ain't you got no respect, boy? \nBOBBY You want something? \nBLIND MAN Yeah I want something.  I want you to run over to that machine and get me a pop. \nBOBBY You can't do that yourself? \nBLIND MAN Hell no, I can't do that myself.  I'm blind.  Can't you see that? \nBOBBY I'm sorry, I didn't-- \nBLIND MAN What'd you think I was doing out here with these glasses on?  Sunnin' myself? \nBOBBY I don't know.  I thought you were keeping the sun out of your eyes. \nBLIND MAN I ain't got no eyes.  You want to see? \nBOBBY Christ no! \nBLIND MAN Lost my eyes in Vyee-et-nam.  Lost them fighting the commies.  Fought the war and lost my eyes fightin' the commies just so you can come around here and make fun of me. \nBOBBY I said I was sorry. \nBLIND MAN Don't be sorry.  Just run over there and get me my pop before I die of thirst. \nBOBBY Yeah, sure.  You got change? \nBLIND MAN Change?  You want my change?  I fought the war and lost my eyes just so I could give you my change? \nBOBBY All right, old man.  Christ. \nBobby walks across the street to a very old soda machine; it has bottles instead of cans.  The blind man shouts to Bobby. \nBLIND MAN Get me a Dr. Peppa!  I don't want no Colas. Colas ain't nothing but flavored water. \nBobby puts change in the machine and pulls out a bottle of Dr. Pepper.  He starts back to the blind man. \nBLIND MAN Don't forget to open it for me.  I can't be opening my own bottle. \nBOBBY Christ! \nBobby goes back to the machine and opens the bottle, then walks back to the old man who pours a splash on the ground. \nBLIND MAN A little for Mother Earth. I'm about fifty percent Indian, you know. To all our relations. \nHe takes a hearty swig of the soda. \nBLIND MAN Ah!  Just what I needed!  Want some? \nThe blind man holds the bottle out to Bobby.  A string of saliva runs from his lips to the bottle's neck. \nBOBBY I'll pass. \nBobby reaches down and pets the old man's dog. Flies buzz around both the dog and the Blind Man. \nBOBBY I think you'd better give your pooch a sip. He looks sick. \nBLIND MAN That's 'cause he's dead. \nBOBBY Nice place. \nGRACE Thank you. \nGrace sits on the edge of the bed. Bobby indicates the picture, ironic. \nBOBBY Who's that, your father? \nGRACE (without much thought) Stepfather... \nBOBBY (coy) Got a boyfriend? \nGRACE No. Not really. \nBobby senses she's lying but plays along. \nBOBBY Must get kind of lonely for a woman living by herself in a big house. \nGRACE I guess it must. \nBOBBY What do you do anyway? \nGRACE A little of this, a little of that.  Mostly I tell fortunes. \nBOBBY Where'd you learn to do that? \nGRACE From my father.  He was the tribe's shaman. \nBOBBY A medicine man? \nGRACE Those are white words, not ours. \nBOBBY Nice house for a shaman's daughter.  You must be good. \nGRACE Come here. \nBobby goes to Grace and kneels before her.  She takes his head in her hands and looks deep into his eyes.  Her voice goes thick, but soft, like a morning fog. \nGRACE There's something in your past; something you want to keep hidden.  There's a pain. Something ... someone you can't forget. And there is something you want very badly. It seems very far away to you, but you are determined, and you will do what you must to get it. \nBobby closes his hands on Grace's and takes them from his face. He is more than slightly spooked by the accuracy of Grace's reading. \nBOBBY My face tell you all that? \nGRACE It tells me what every face tells me. Everybody has a past, they have a pain, and they have something they want. (seductively) What is it you want? \nBOBBY The same thing you do. \nThey silently stare into each other's eyes. \nGRACE Really?  I want to hang drapes. \nGrace walks from the room.  For a moment Bobby stares after her. He takes an ice cube from his glass and crunches it in his teeth. \nINT. GRACE'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nGRACE is standing on a step ladder trying to hang the drapes. BOBBY notices a photo of Grace with an older INDIAN WOMAN, her mother? \nGRACE Hold me. \nBobby stands behind her, gently places his hands on Grace's waist. \nGRACE Tighter.  I won't break. You know girls are a lot tougher than men think. \nBobby holds her tighter as she finished hanging the drapes.  His eyes are transfixed on her ass. \nGRACE There.  All done.  Lift me down. \nBOBBY What? \nGRACE Lift me down. \nBobby lifts Grace down from the ladder.  He holds her, his hands around her waist. \nGRACE You can let go of me now. I'm safe.(with a wicked smile) How do they look? \nBOBBY Like you. \nGRACE Beautiful? \nBOBBY (kidding) Like they're made of polyester. \nGRACE I like them.  I was sick of looking at this room.  I think they add a little life. \nJake punches him in the nose. \nJAKE You can't just walk in here and walk out, you sonufabitch! I'm gonna tear you a new asshole! \nBOBBY You broke my nose! \nJAKE It ain't broke. \nIt probably isn't, but it bleeds. Bobby feels the blood and then sees it on his shirt. \nBOBBY Goddamn it! I'm... you're lucky I don't sue you. \nJAKE (opens the door) Get goin' Junior. \nBobby glares back at Grace who gives him a maddening little smile. \nBOBBY You people are crazy! \nHe storms out holding his nose. \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - LATER - DAY \nBOBBY, holding a handkerchief to his nose which has stopped bleeding, hauling his bag on his shoulder, walks back to town along the side of the road. Already he is caked with a mixture of sweat and dust, looking up at the relentless sun that beats down on him. \nBOBBY Fuckin' shithole! \nA CADILLAC slows beside him, JAKE driving. \nBOBBY What the fuck do you want? \nJAKE I'll give you a lift, son. Too hot to be walking... People die out here, y'know. \nBobby continues walking. \nJAKE Aw, you're not still upset about that love tap, are you? If I meant you real trouble, I'd have given it to you by now. Get in, lad. Come on. Get in. \nBobby gets in. \nJAKE After you huffed off, Grace lied so bad, I got so pissed off, I pulled down her pants to paddle her ass raw and finger-fucked it instead. Sorry I lost my cool like that. It's a funny thing, women. \nBOBBY Yeah... \nJAKE Say, what happened to your hand? \nBOBBY Accident. \nJAKE You've got to be-- \nBOBBY Yeah, I know.  More careful. \nJAKE I guess we've never been introduced proper. Jake McKenna. \nBOBBY That's a solid name. \nJAKE I'm a solid man. \nBOBBY Bobby Cooper. \nJAKE \"Bobby Cooper.\" What brings you to Superior, Coop? \nBOBBY An overheated car. \nJAKE Oh? Darrell taking good care of you? \nBOBBY Darrell's a moron. \nJAKE (laughs) Yeah, he sure is a character. You need any help with that car now?... Where you headed? \nBOBBY California... \nJAKE Live there? \nBOBBY Got work.  I know a man who's got a boat. Wants me to sail it for him. \nJAKE You a sailor man?  That'd be the life. Drive across the country, step on a boat and just sail away.  A man could pretty well disappear like that.  Just sail away until all he was was a memory.  I guess a little place like this would just be a dot on a map to you after awhile. \nBOBBY I hope so. (beat) Listen, McKenna about your wife:  If I had known she was married-- \nJAKE It wouldn't have made a difference to you, now would it?  Not a wit.  Do you know why? Because you're a man without scruples. \nBOBBY Wait a second-- \nJAKE Ah, I can smell it on you. \nBOBBY You don't need numbers.  That's why it's expensive.  Look at the gold. \nDarrell doubts that, shake his head. \nDARRELL ...got no day, got no date.  Probably ain't worth a duck's fart (proffers his own watch). This one here cost me $3.75 and it's got every doodad you can imagine. No sir I'll stick with this (walks away). \nBOBBY You son of a bitch! I'll have my lawyers shut you down. \nDARRELL You ain't got no credit card but you got a lawyer. Sweet talk me all you want.  Didn't you read the sign? It says... \nBOBBY What sign? Fuck the sign. I want my car. \nDARRELL I want my hundred and forty-five dollars. \nBobby stands his ground for a moment as if deciding whether or not to fight for the car, then wheels and walks away. \nDarrell looks at him, smirks. \nINT. TRUCK STOP/DINER - LATER \nIt is a little worn diner-type stop one would find on most any open road:  Counter with stools, laminated menus, a Wurlitzer in the corner belching out country TUNES.  Business is slow but it's the only restaurant in town. There is a SHORT ORDER COOK in the kitchen, and FLO, a hard-looking waitress is behind the counter.  A couple of regular drivers, ED and BOYD, are seated on the stools, Boyd is flipping a coin. \nED One-hundred-thirteen degrees.  That was back in July of forty-seven. That afternoon it dropped down to forty three! True story. \nBOYD One time last year I remember it went from 98 to 23 same day. Wind, black clouds come out like... \nBOBBY comes out of the men's room and sits at the end of the counter.  He has cleaned himself up a bit but still looks like a mess. He buries his face in the menu. \nBOBBY You got a beer? \nFLO What kind? \nBOBBY Beck's. \nFLO No Beck's. A-1, Coors... \nBOBBY Heineken? \nFLO No, we ain't got no Heineken.  We got Miller. \nBOBBY Genuine Draft? \nFLO No.  Just plain ol' Miller. Now you can fuckin' take it or you can fuckin' leave it. \nBOBBY I'll fuckin' take it. To go. \nSHORT ORDER COOK Flo, cheeseburger bleedin'. \nFLO I'll be right back with that beer. \nFlo moves off. \nBOBBY ...and a waitress named Flo.  Christ. \nAs Bobby stares at the money on the counter in front of him, he hears, from somewhere outside the diner, the sound of a POLICE RADIO crackling. He now feels something against his foot.  He looks down and sees a CAT rubbing against his leg.  He gives it a good kick sending it sliding across the floor with a screech. \nBOBBY Fucking cat. \nIn the background, two teenagers sit at a booth.  TOBY looks the part of a local, wearing jeans and a white T-shirt.  His hair is cropped close and he looks to be a senior in high school.  His girl, JENNY, is nondescript, neither ugly nor beautiful. She is the kind of girl most guys would pass without a second look. Toby gets up from his booth and goes to the bathroom.  After he is gone Jenny walks to Bobby. \nJENNY Hey, Mister.  You gotta quarter for the juke? \nBOBBY What? \nJENNY I wanna play a song on the juke.  You got a quarter? \nBobby looks at Jenny, then picks a quarter from his winnings and flips it to her. He can't resist putting a little charm into it. \nJENNY What happened to your hand? \nBOBBY I cut it shaving; I know, I gotta be more careful. \nJENNY Got any requests? \nBOBBY That country shit all sounds the same to me. \nJENNY How about I pick one out for you? \nBobby half smiles.  Jenny plays a song.  Patsy Cline's \"Your Cheatin' Heart.\"  Jenny takes up a stool next to Bobby's. \nJENNY You like Patsy Cline?  I just love her. How come, I wonder, she don't put out no more new records. \nBOBBY Cause she's dead. \nSHERIFF More like Jenny is after every man she sees. \nFLO (to Bobby) You pay Toby no mind.  He just likes to show off for his girl.  Give him a couple of hours, he'll cool off.  Still want that beer? \nBOBBY (tense, seeing the Sheriff) I'll take it to go. \nBobby holds his hand to his face to cover the cut on his forehead. \nED How's it with you, Sheriff? \nSHERIFF Already started out bad.  Couple of bikers from out of town tried to knock over Jamilla's grocery store this morning. It was a real shootout. \nBOYD What happened? \nSHERIFF The old witch killed 'em both. \nED Holy shit! \nFLO Poor thing.  Is she all right? \nSHERIFF Sure, when the sons of bitches tried to steal her wedding ring. That's when she started shooting.  Can't blame her.  The ring was all Carlos left her when he died. Store's a mess. \nBOYD It's the desert.  That's what it is.  The desert makes everybody crazy.  Ain't that right, Sheriff?  People go crazy out here. \nED Come on, Boyd.  I've got to make tracks. That yogurt's got to make Santa Fe before it spoils. \nBOYD Dr. Pepper don't have that problem. \nEd and Boyd toss a few bills on the counter and exit.  Flo stands near the cash register with Bobby's beer. \nFLO I can't open off-sale for you, sugar. \nBobby pays for the beer ($1.75).  Flo opens the register. \nFLO Let me get your change. \nSHERIFF Flo, I'm just gonna help myself to a refill on the coffee. \nThe Sheriff reaches around the counter for the pot. \nFLO You be careful now, Virgil. \nJust as the words leave Flo's mouth the Sheriff spills the pot. It shatters against the floor spilling hot coffee everywhere. Flo runs over to him. \nSHERIFF Son of a bitch! \nFLO Virgil!  Now look at what you done!  Are you all right? \nSHERIFF I think I burned my gun hand! \nAs Flo bends to wipe the counter, Virgil touches her intimately. \nSHERIFF (Cont'd) How 'bout we put something soft on it later? (a look) \nFLO (quietly) I could put some butter on it, hon'. (Her normal abrasive voice) It'd serve you right, you asshole.  Put it under some cold water. Joe, run get a mop and clean this fuckin' mess up. \nWhile everyone is distracted Bobby notices that the register drawer has been left open.  He looks around to make sure he is not being watched.  Slowly he eases his hand towards the drawer. It gets closer and closer.  As he is about to grab the money there, the cat - the same one he kicked away earlier - hisses and claws at his hand.  Bobby jumps back startled. \nFLO Shasta!  Now why'd you go and scare the nice man like that?  Sorry about that, mister.  Let's see, you want $3.25. (gives it to him) You try to have a nice day now, would you? \nBOBBY Sure, I'll try. \nWith the Sheriff occupied, and the Mexican Jose mopping the floor, Bobby exits. \nEXT. PHONE BOOTH - STREET - DAY \nBOBBY begs on the phone. \nBOBBY Cici?  Cici, it's Bobby...Bobby Cooper...Yeah, look, I know it's been a while, but I'm kind of in a jam...yeah...One-hundred-fifty dollars...That's a lie. I called you on your birthday..Two years ago...I can't help it if you didn't get the message. Cici, honey, I don't want to argue. I need you to wire me the money...Because they're fucking going to KILL ME!  I didn't steal your CD's...Yeah, well where's my Mr. Coffee. Cici...Cici... \nBobby slams the phone. \nBOBBY Bitch. Cunt. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nEXT. SAME PHONE BOOTH - STREET - DAY \nBOBBY is on another call, circling a local sports page betting line. \nBOBBY 73-11, this is Pluto. What's the line on Dallas? \nGAMBLER'S VOICE Pluto. Fucking deadbeat. We head about you. You owe \"the commie\" 13 dimes, why you tryin' to get in my office? Lose this fuckin' number. \nJAKE Oh yeah sure. Why don't I buy you a plane ticket right out of here while I'm at it. I know you... (then) This is what you do:  Go to the house to see her. \nBOBBY (beat) And tell her what? \nEXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER DAY \nBOBBY stands on the porch talking to GRACE through the screen of the front door.  The look on his face is sincere.  Hers is skeptical.  We see the action take place as we hear Jake's V.O.: \nJAKE(V.O.) ...I don't know.  Tell her you had to see her.  Tell her you don't care if she's married or not, you had to be with her. Sweet talk the woman.  A young buck like you must be good at that.  Then ... maybe shift the conversation.  Get her thinking about that jeep of hers.  She loves that thing.  Maybe the only thing she does love. She'll want to take you for a ride. \nBOBBY I know you're not surprised I'm back here, cause you can read my mind and all. \nShe's not surprised. \nGRACE (seeing his new cut) That's some cut. I told you to be more careful. \nBOBBY Yeah, well I said I was an idiot. Whatta you say we get out of here, take a drive somewhere, talk... \nGRACE How do you know he's still not here? \nBOBBY Guys like me take those chances. Let's go. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nGRACE'S JEEP cuts hard across the desert.  Grace has a wild, excited look on her face.  BOBBY sits next to her looking somewhat nervous. \nJAKE(V.O.) She'll take you out somewhere in the desert.  She loves it out there; ridin' through the red rock and the mesas.  So do I.  I guess we got that in common.  She'll ride you out someplace quiet.  Someplace deserted. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. DESERT - LATER DAY \nGRACE has stopped the JEEP on a plateau.  BOBBY sits beneath its shade while Grace walks in the sun seemingly unaffected by the heat. VULTURES swoop above. \nJAKE(V.O.) There won't be anyone for miles around. Just the two of you and some prairie dogs. That's all.  You can sweet talk her a little if you like.  Makes no difference to me.  Just put her at ease, make her feel relaxed -- then do it. \nJAKE'S V.O. ends.  The scene is now synch with real time. \nBOBBY Are there snakes out here? \nGRACE They hear you comin'.  They won't bother you. Just don't sneak up on 'em. \nBOBBY Doesn't the isolation bother you? \nGRACE Yeah, but I like the sun.  I grew up on a reservation.  The sun, the desert; they like a religion to us.  Jake's the same way.  He loves the desert.  I guess we're alike that way.  That's about the only way. \nBOBBY You love him? \nGRACE No. \nBOBBY Did you ever? \nGRACE Depends on what you call love. I grew up on a reservation. A patch of desert in the middle of nowhere. That's where they stick Indians, Bobby. That's where they leave us to die. My brother killed himself when he was 19 cause he couldn't take it anymore. There's no hope there... Jake was my ticket out. Mom and me. \nBOBBY Is that why you're with him? \nGRACE I let him think he was courtin' me, but I reeled him in like a fish on a line. I wanted him. I wanted what he could give me, and I would've done anything to get him. Is that love? \nBOBBY I'm guessing no. \nGRACE Yeah, I guess you're right. \nBOBBY I take it things didn't much work out the way you planned. \nGRACE I'm still here, aren't I?  See this? \nGrace sweeps her hand before her across the expanse of the desert. The vultures are very much a part of this landscape. \nGRACE(CONT) All this nothing? It doesn't get to Jake like it gets to me.  He says he don't mind being nothing but a big fish in a small pond.  More like a little fish in a dried up watering hole. \nBOBBY You could leave him. \nGRACE I don't know how. \nBOBBY Walk away. \nGRACE It's not that easy.  Maybe you can take chances; maybe you can wander around like some stray wherever you please.  I can't. I don't want to be alone.  I need to know I'm going to be taken care of. \nBOBBY You need a meal ticket is what you mean. Some guy you can latch onto just long enough for him to get you out of here. \nGRACE Is that so bad?  It's not like I wouldn't try to make him happy.  For awhile, anyway. I mean, I would ... do things for him.  I guess I'm no good that way.  I guess I tried to sucker you along like that.  Do you hate me for it?  I wouldn't blame you if you did.  But maybe it's like you said: You just got to do whatever it takes to get out. \nBOBBY (soft echo) Whatever it takes. \nGRACE Darrell?  You know he and Jake are... \nBOBBY You don't have any money put away, do you? \nGRACE Jake never gives me more'n twenty bucks at a time, like a bird in a cage, he don't want me goin' anywhere... \nBOBBY ...you could get me money. I'll get you out of here. \nShe looks at him. \nGRACE There's money. A lot. \nThe words hang there, thick between them. \nBOBBY Where? \nGRACE Jake hides it. In a safe. In the floor. In the bedroom. He counts it. He loves to sit there and count it. \nBOBBY What do you mean? \nGRACE At night. He just sits there and laughs and talks to himself and counts it. I heard him. My Mom told me he had a hunnert thousand dollars down there. Maybe more. \nBobby's eyes widen in hope. \nBOBBY In cash? \nGRACE Oh yeah. There's nothing else with Jake. He don't trust banks. He keeps the money in the floor right under the bed. He loves it so much, he wouldn't think of spending any of it on me. I never seen it but I know he's got more than a hunnert thousand at least... \nBOBBY One-hundred-thousand!?  That son-of-a-bitch. \nGRACE (puzzled) What do you mean? \nBOBBY (ignoring her) If it's in a safe we'd have to get the combination-- \nGRACE It takes a key.  He keeps it on himself all the time.  I mean all the time.  It scratches up against me when we do it. \nBOBBY If the key's on him, how do we get the key? \nGRACE Kill him. \nSpoken almost innocently, it hangs there between them. A silence. \nBOBBY I can't kill, Grace. I can't kill anybody. \nGRACE It's not like he's a young man, Bobby. He's had time to live. It'd be quick. I mean, he wouldn't even have to feel it... (seductively) I mean, sometime in the middle of the night, when it's quiet...when he's asleep, you could just come up behind him when he's pounding on me and... \nGrace lays her hands on Bobby, starting to caress him. He bristles and freezes with fear and disgust. \nBOBBY Shit! Listen to you... Are you crazy, Grace? \nHe abruptly pulls away. \nBOBBY Jesus Christ! I think this place is making me crazy. I was crazy to come back here and see you. I'm crazy for listening to anyone in this town, and I'd sure as hell be crazy if I spent another minute with you. \nGrace rises, covering her nakedness, shooting a hand to his face, like she did when she read his fortune. \nGRACE But it's in you, Bobby. I see it. I see Death. It's in your heart. Let it out for me. Let it out... \nHe's mesmerized. Then: \nGRACE Do it for me, Bobby, you'll never regret it. I promise you. I'll do anything for you. Anything. \nBobby pauses, terribly torn. \nBOBBY I...take me back to town... \nHe turns away, towards the jeep. Grace has a tone of desperation in her voice. \nGRACE You need the money, Bobby. It's a lot more than $100,000. A lot more. How are you going to get out of here? You need the money. Whatever it takes, Bobby, remember? \nBobby walks past the jeep, on his way back to town alone. \nGRACE Where you going? I'll give you the ride...Come back! Bobby? It's three miles. \nBobby doesn't look back. Her eyes drift backwards into her solitude. \nGRACE (to herself) Bobby?...Whatever it takes. \nEXT. DESERT/ALONG THE ROAD - LATER DAY \nBOBBY walks through the desert parallel to the road, still in a rage. Desert insects produce a cacophony of drones, buzzes, and clicks. A rattlesnake darts off a rock into the brush. A VOICE whispers to him. \nJAKE (V.O.) You've got the killing in you, boy. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nBOBBY, depressed, is heading towards Harlin's gas station, passing JENNY sitting on a corner drinking a soda, almost as if waiting for him. She runs to him, and follows him, as somewhere a POLICE RADIO crackles and buzzes. \nJENNY Hey mister. Mister, I just... I just wanted to thank you. \nBOBBY For what? \nJENNY For defending my honor this afternoon. \nBOBBY I hate to bust your bubble honey, but I wasn't defending you. \nJENNY But you was going to fight for me. \nBOBBY I wasn't going to fight for you.  I was just going to beat the shit out of your boyfriend. \nJENNY He's not my boyfriend.  I mean, I let him take me out and stuff, but I ain't spoken for.  Not yet that is. \nBOBBY Get it through your head, little girl; I'm not going for you.  If this Toby likes you, then if I were you I'd marry him.  You're not going to get much better in this town. \nJENNY That's what I thought until you came riding in.  I saw your car over at the gas station.  It's a cool car.  Want to take me for a ride?  Desert's kind of lonely this time of day. \nBOBBY How old are you? \nJENNY (beat) Eighteen... Well, I'm gonna be eighteen in two years, but that don't mean you can't take me for a ride if you want. \nBOBBY No, I don't want to take you for a ride. What I want is for ... Hey, you don't think you can get $150 from your parents, could you? \nFrom OFF CAMERA we hear TOBY. \nTOBY(O.C.) Mister! \nBOBBY Oh, shit! \nToby moves menacingly up the street towards Bobby. \nTOBY That's right, Mister.  You better be afraid.  I told you it wasn't over, but you didn't listen.  Now I find you sneakin' around with my girl behind my back. \nBOBBY I wasn't sneaking around with your girl. Would you please tell him? \nJENNY You're too late, Toby.  We're going to get in his fancy car and ride off and leave you behind. \nBOBBY What the hell are you talking about? \nJENNY What's your name anyway? \nTOBY Oh, that tears it, Mister.  I'm gonna bust you up but good.  I'm gonna bust you into a million pieces and then ... and then bust those pieces up, and then ... and then spread them all around.  That's what I'm gonna do.  You don't know what you're dealing with, Mister.  I'm crazy.  I'm psycho crazy. \nBOBBY Yeah, I know.  You're TNT.  Just like dynamite.  When you go off somebody gets hurt. (at his wit's end) All right.  Let's do this. \nJENNY Toby Tucker, it don't matter to me if you beat him all up and knock out all his teeth and he's just drooling and bleeding all over hisself, 'cause we love each other and we gonna run off, and I'm gonna have his love child. \nBOBBY Will you shut up! \nTOBY You gonna pay for that, Mister. \nToby and Bobby square off, sizing each other up and preparing for a violent confrontation.  Just as the two are about to clash we hear the voice of SHERIFF POTTER from OFF CAMERA. \nSHERIFF(O.C.) Toby! \nThe two men freeze in their tracks, as Potter drives up fast. \nTOBY Hey, Sheriff Potter. \nSHERIFF (tough) Toby, I just came from your mother's place. She's worried sick about you.  She says she ain't seen you since this morning. \nTOBY That ain't true, Sheriff.  I was home for lunch. \nSHERIFF Boy, I'm not trying to hear nothing from you except that you're heading home.  Now run along. \nTOBY Yes, sir.  Come on, Jenny. \nJENNY I want to stay. \nTOBY I said come on! \nToby grabs Jenny by the wrist and literally pulls he along.  As she goes she yells back to Bobby. \nJENNY Bye, Mister.  Don't go nowhere without me. I wanna have your love child. \nToby points a vicious finger at Bobby. \nTOBY Next time, Mister.  Next time. \nBOBBY I didn't tell you to replace any gasket. \nDARRELL Yeah, but it was shot. \nBOBBY I don't give a fuck! I didn't tell you to do it!  You can't just do unauthorized work. \nDARRELL Well, now, you just know all there is about bein' a mechanic, don't you?  Didn't you read the sign. \nBOBBY What sign? \nDARRELL The goddamn sign on the wall. I can't do unauthorized work?  What am I suppose to do? Just let you ride out of here with a bad gasket.  Then you get in an accident and get killed.  Or worse.  Who they gonna blame then?  They gonna blame me, and there goes my reputation. \nBOBBY What reputation?  You're nothing but an ignorant, inbred, tumbleweed hick. \nDARRELL Is that an insult?  Are you insulting me. \nBOBBY Listen you stupid fuck, I want my car. \nDARRELL Listen to me you sorry sonufabitch. You owe me money, and this car ain't going nowheres until I get it.  And if you take another five hours I'll find another fifty dollars worth of work to do on it. Is that clear? Now get out of here 'fore I call the Sheriff, who knows me. \nBobby is in a rage.  He turns to leave and walks a few paces. He sees a WRENCH lying on a table.  For a second his mind reels, then he snatches up the wrench and turns ready to smash it down on Darrell's head.  He stops cold.  Because ol' Darrell holds a CROWBAR in a batter's stance ready to smash it onto the Mustang. \nDARRELL You want to play, Mister?  I'll play with you.  You want to smash something?  So do I. \nDarrell pulls back the crowbar, ready to swing. \nBOBBY No! Okay! Okay! \nDARRELL What's the matter?  The fight gone out of you?  I'm just gonna smash a headlight. Maybe two. \nBOBBY (pleading, almost crying) Please, just leave the car alone! \nDARRELL Mister, you already pissed me off but good. \nDarrell lays the tip of the crowbar on the hood of the car, and drags the tip of the bar across the hood leaving a long scratch. \nBOBBY (about to lose it) Goddamn you!  You son of a bitch! \nDARRELL There you go, sweet talking me again. \nDarrell begins to laugh. Bobby, desperate, looks to the trunk, thinking of his gun in there. \nHis POV -- the trunk. A FLASHBACK of the GUN goes through his mind. \nBOBBY Look, Harlin. \nDARRELL Darrell. \nBOBBY Darrell. I'll get you your money. I just have to get something out of the trunk. \nUsing his TRUNK KEY, he tries to open it but realizes the lock has been changed. \nBOBBY What the fuck did you do to my trunk? \nDARRELL Well, that key's not gonna work. I had to pop the lock. You didn't leave me the trunk key. \nBOBBY And you had to go into the trunk, didn't you? \nDARRELL When I work on a car, I work on a car. \nBOBBY (snaps) You motherfucker! (etc.) \nDARRELL You can't help yourself, can you mister? You're out of control. \nDarrell starts to laugh. It is a repetitive, almost demonic laugh that grows louder as the camera slowly dollies in on Bobby's anguished face. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nAs BOBBY steps out into the glaring sun, he notices down at the other end of the town, GRACE'S JEEP parked right outside the SHERIFF'S OFFICE, empty. \nPresently, GRACE and the SHERIFF walk out TALKING, and she gets in, says a few last words and drives away. \nBobby backs around a corner into a sidestreet. Is she selling him out? He's very confused, turbulent. \nINT. BUS DEPOT - LATER DAY \nBOBBY enters the BUS DEPOT.  The interior is poorly lit.  There are a few benches for people to wait on, but they sit empty. Old, faded travel posters hang on the wall.  A bored FEMALE CLERK is behind the counter. \nBOBBY I need a ticket. \nCLERK Where to? \nBOBBY Out of here. \nSergei looking Bobby's direction. \nSHERIFF Get out of the car, spread them. You can jawbone all you want or you have the right to shut the fuck up! You commie motherfucker. Either way you're goin' to the can. \nSERGEI I want my lawyer! \nSheriff cuffs Sergei and sticks him in the police car. \nBobby can't help smiling as he turns away to the SODA MACHINE seen in an earlier scene. \nHe comes up with the change the bus clerk left him and, dying for a drink in this heat, inserts the coin. Though still under considerable pressure from all sides, this lucky break with Sergei seems like it might be the beginning of something new today -- some luck. \nThe icy cold soda bottle shoots out. Bobby raises it to his lips, about to taste it, about to relax for once. Violently it explodes out of his hands as he doubles over in blinding pain from a KIDNEY PUNCH. He stumbles forward into the soda machine, gasping. The legs of his assailant are close to him, but the face is unseen. \nBobby doubles his agony as his bandaged left stump takes the brunt of the blow into the machine, re-opening the wound. Blood starts to seep through the bandage. \nBOBBY Ow! \nBobby crumples to the ground as TOBY now towers over him with his fists curled and a snarl on his lips. \nTOBY Get up, Mister!  Don't ever let it be said Toby Tucker beat the living shit out of someone without giving them a fair chance. \nBOBBY (gasping) What the hell are you doing?  You fucking psycho! \nTOBY I'm doing what any man would do if he'd been offended.  I'm stompin' your ass. \nBOBBY You idiot!  You don't even know what you're fighting over! \nTOBY My honor, that's what I'm fighting over. Now get up off the ground, or do I have to whoop you where you lie? \nJENNY comes running up the street. \nJENNY Toby!  Toby Tucker, leave him alone! \nTOBY You stay away, Jenny.  I aim to mess him up, and that ain't a thing for a woman to see. \nJenny runs to Bobby and cuddles him where he lays. \nJENNY Don't be afraid of him none.  I don't care what he does to you, we can still be together. \nBOBBY Get away from me! \nBobby sees his bus ticket on the ground.  He grabs for it, but Toby beats him to it. \nTOBY Now, what's this? \nBOBBY Give it to me! \nTOBY Mexico?  You going to Mexico? \nBOBBY I'm leaving.  You never have to see me again.  Just please, give me the ticket! \nTOBY This means something to you?  Jenny means something to me. \nToby sticks the ticket in his mouth and chews it up whole. \nBOBBY Nooo! \nTOBY (between bites) I'm gonna beat you so bad you gonna be eatin' nothing but soup the erst of your days.  Rain dogs is gonna be prettier than you when I'm done.  I'm gonna mess you up so bad you gonna make your own momma sick. I'm gonna ... \nToby's words drift to Bobby from a million miles away.  The world around him is like a dream, or a nightmare.  A primal rage wells inside of Bobby that rises up in a howl as he swings the soda bottle up out of nowhere across Toby's head, smashing him backwards. Then he lands blow after blow with his right hand on the boy's face and head. \nJenny screams: \nJENNY Stop it!  You're killing him! \nJenny grabs Bobby's arm, literally hanging all her weight on it, stopping him from striking Toby again. \nJENNY You're killing him!  Toby!?  Toby!? \nJenny sinks to the ground and cuddles Toby.  Bobby stands.  He looks at Toby, then at his bloodied knuckles in disbelief. His bandage is soaked with his own blood, but his adrenaline numbs the pain. \nJENNY You killed him! You killed him! \nShe wails in the background as he backs away, around the corner, into Main Street, crossing to where the PHONE BOOTH is. \nEXT. PHONE BOOTH - LATE DAY \nBOBBY is on the phone. \nBOBBY Hello, Grace?  It's Bobby. \nINTERCUTS TO: \nJAKE What the hell you looking at, girl? \nGRACE Nothing, Jake.  Absolutely nothing. \nEXT. DESERT - EVENING \nThe SUN is setting. It strikes the horizon sending a ripple of golden light through the sky. \nEXT. PORCH OF HOUSE - EVENING \nA MAN dances in the evening light with a small child in his arms. \nEXT. CORNER OF HOUSE - EVENING \nA DOG and CAT huddle together in sleep. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - EVENING \nSHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER is tossing horseshoes with his DEPUTIES. \nEXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - EVENING \nGRACE watches the sun going down outside her house, cradling herself in her arms. A desert wind gently caresses her. \nEXT. STREET CORNER - NIGHT \nThe BLIND MAN, along with his dead DOG, sits on the side of the street. \nBLIND MAN Well, that's it.  Sun's going down.  People go home, trade stories over dinner. They'll talk about the day, about the heat, laugh about something crazy it made them do.  They'll kiss, sleep a few hours, then do it all over again. \nBOBBY now appears next to the blind man holding two Dr. Peppers. He hands one to the blind man, takes a sip of the other one, and offers him his own change. \nBOBBY The day wasn't so bad.  We all got through it all right. \nBLIND MAN (giving back the change) Keep it. \nThere's a suggestion of cockiness in Bobby, feeling his luck coming back with the night. His humour is enhanced by his POV down the street: \nAs DARRELL, with his dilapidated truck, readies SERGEI'S convertible for towing. \nBLIND MAN (OVER) Ain't over yet.  Night is part of day; separate, but equal.  Night is when you let your guard down; when you see things in the shadows and hear things in the dark. \nBOBBY Difference between you and me, old man, is I see the glass half full, you see it half empty. \nBLIND MAN Night is when you want to sleep, but the dry heat keeps you tossin' and turnin'. It's when you wish the sun was bakin' high in the sky so you could see what it is you're afraid of. \nBOBBY You afraid of the dark? \nBLIND MAN Afraid of it?  Boy, I live in the dark. All cause of a woman who made me this way. People are afraid of what they can't see. I can't see nuthin', so it's all the same to me.  Kiss from a beautiful woman, kissy kissy kiss, a lick from a dog, slurp, slurp, the kiss of death (he makes a strange sound). It's all the same to me. \nBOBBY So, we're all just floating along like twigs in a stream, so enjoy the ride.  Is that it? \nBLIND MAN More or less. \nBOBBY Not this twig, friend.  I got plans. \nBLIND MAN Nothing makes the Great Spirit laugh harder than a man's plans. We all got plans. I planned on seeing all my life. I know you didn't plan on straying into town. \nBOBBY No and I don't plan on sticking around either. \nBLIND MAN Well, don't say I didn't warn you when things go your way. \nBOBBY You got a lotta philosophy in you, old timer but you don't fool me for one second with all this blind man crap. One minute you lost your eyes in Vietnam, next it's the joint. Now it's a woman? I'm hep to you. \nThe Blind Man slowly lifts his glasses, showing his EYES at last. Where his eyes should be are scars and dead flesh. An ugly sight that even takes Bobby back a step. \nBLIND MAN Used to be a young smartass like you. Then I got smart with the wrong man's daughter. Got some acid poured on my peepers for my trouble. You know human beings ain't always just human -- they got animals living inside 'em too...People give spare change to war heroes not fools. All fools get is pity. May not have eyes, but I see. And you, boy? \nThe Blind Man puts his glasses back on. \nBLIND MAN You got my pity. \nBOBBY (doesn't believe him) Hope she was worth it. \nBLIND MAN Oh, she was worth it.  She was worth every black minute since. \nBobby looks at his watch, gets ready to go, drops a coin into the Blind Man's cup. \nBOBBY Time's up. Any last words of wisdom? \nBLIND MAN Things ain't always the way they seem. You got to ask yourself: is it worth it? Day comes Earthmaker is going to look in your fucking heart! Then you better know what it is you're doing. Are you a human being -- or just one of them hungry ghosts out there floatin' around? \nBobby walks away, smiling. \nHe maneuvers her aside and slips out the door into the corridor. \nINT. LIVING ROOM/MCKENNA HOUSE - SIMULTANEOUS \nCrowbar in one hand, BOBBY makes his way slowly through the living room, banging against the edge of a table. He hops silently in pain, then waits at the door to the next room and listens.  Hearing nothing he slowly pokes his head into the darkness.  A moment later Bobby backs from the door and we see the barrel of his own black .9mm BARETTA pressed against his forehead.  JAKE appears now, backing him into the living room. He switches on a LAMP. \nJAKE Well, well.  As I live and breathe.  I didn't expect to be seeing the like of you again.  Thought you'd be long on your way by now. \nJake continues to press the gun to Bobby's head. \nBOBBY That's my gun...(then) That fucking Darrell! \nJAKE I like Darrell.  He may be an idiot, but he's my half brother. We own Harlin's together, yeah, that little redneck manages to get paid no matter how things work out. \nBOBBY (realizing) You been workin' me the whole time. \nJAKE I guess this is what they call \"ironee\"? Hunh? \nBOBBY It's not what you think, Jake. \nJAKE No, but it don't matter anyway when you're lying there with your brains all over my carpet and I'm telling Sheriff Potter about this drifter, didn't have enough money to fix his car. And Darrell happened to find his gun, and through maybe this drifter heard old Jake got some money stashed away, and figgered he might try to break in and steal it! \nBOBBY Wait a minute.  Just listen to me... \nJAKE ...And he thought he'd clock old Jake McKenna and turn his brains into wall paper...and then maybe borrow $200 or $20,000, or $200,000... \nBOBBY (very serious) That's not the reason I'm here, Jake. \nJAKE There's another reason? It better be good. \nINT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS \nGRACE makes her way down the hall in a nightgown, and now hides in shadow, listening. \nBOBBY (V.O.) I came for Grace. \nJAKE (V.O.) You came to take my wife from me? \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SIMULTANEOUS \nBOBBY (sincere) No. I came to kill her. \nINT. HALLWAY \nGRACE'S eyes get real narrow and angry. \nJAKE (V.O.) Shhh! Liar. \nBOBBY (V.O.) It's the truth, Jake. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nJAKE That's a thick change of heart from this afternoon. \nBOBBY Maybe I don't like being played, like she played us today.  Maybe I don't like that at all, Jake. I'm just pissed enough, maybe I'll rip the neck off my own grandmother. \nJAKE You have a lot of talk in you, whole lot of talk. \nBOBBY Damn it, Jake. There is a guy coming to kill me, and if it comes down to me or Grace, then I pick Grace.  You were going to give me thirteen-thousand.  Give me two-hundred.  I'll kill her and dump the body where no one will ever find it. She showed me the perfect place. There won't be enough left for an autopsy.  But I need the the money.  I've got to have the money. \nJake is silent.  He takes his time thinking.  Finally: \nJAKE She's in the bedroom. \nINT. HALLWAY \nGRACE, distressed, starts backing off towards the bedroom. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nBOBBY stares at the automatic in JAKE's hand. \nBOBBY Wanna give me my gun? \nJake laughs, a \"don't even think about it\" look. \nJAKE A strangling'll do just fine. Go to work. \nBobby holds up his eight fingers with a \"you try\" look. Jake shrugs. Bobby points to the crowbar on the carpet. \nBOBBY How 'bout the pipe? \nJAKE (sarcastic) She's got a slender neck. \nGRACE is in a quandary. How many seconds before Bobby walks in to kill her? Or can he really kill her? She's not sure. \nShe looks around the room frantically. Picks up a lamp, puts it down. She looks quickly through her closet, rummages below in the boxes. Suddenly she finds it. \nA dangerous looking Indian HATCHET with a feather hanging off its bindings. It's a formidable piece of iron, quite capable of splitting a skull or impaling flesh. \nGrace hears the footsteps just outside the door. She runs behind the door. \nA moment later, the bedroom door creaks open and BOBBY quietly enters, approaching the bed. We sense the doubt in his eyes as to whether he can kill her. \nIn a reverse POV, Bobby sees the outline of Grace in the bed as victim...closer, closer.  He now lifts the edge of the bedcover but sees a blanket bunched up to resemble a human figure. \nHe suddenly hears a foot fall behind him, then he feels her presence. He spins. \nShe's directly behind him, hatchet raised. His life is in her hands. \nHis eyes, locked in an eternal moment. \nHer eyes, the hatchet. \nSNAP CUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - SIMULTANEOUS \nAs JAKE, anxiously torn, waits, there is a LOUD CRASH, followed by SOUNDS of struggle, of murder, of death. Then... \nGRACE Jake! \nIt is a desperate cry for help. Jake can't help himself. He breaks into a roaring run down the hall to save his beloved. \nJAKE Grace!! \nINT. BEDROOM - SIMULTANEOUS \nJAKE bulls into the bedroom. It's a mess, furniture overturned, sheets and blankets all over the floor. The lights broken. Waiting for him, face down on the floor, is BOBBY'S BODY in a pool of liquid. A broken bottle lies nearby. Bobby's body heaves in its final death throes, and then shudders quiet...  Over there, by the bed, is GRACE, who still clutches the HATCHET. The look on her face is pure shock. \nJAKE Well...looks like you got him, Grace. That's good...that's real good.  He must of slipped past me, but you got him.  Looks like that drifter from this morning.  Got to be careful who you make friends with, sweetheart. \nJake eyes the weapon in Grace's hand. \nJAKE Why don't you put that down? It's all over now.  Put it down. \nGrace eyes the gun in Jake's hand. \nJAKE Go on, girl.  Put it down. \nWhat choice does Grace have?  She lets the hatchet clank to the floor. \nJAKE Aww, that's my Grace:  Not about to let someone get the best of her.  That's what I love about you.  As dangerous as you are unpredictable. \nbehind Jake, the lifeless BOBBY rises up from the floor, very much alive, and clobbers Jake with a golf club. Jake is staggered, but he's one tough old customer as he manages to spin slowly, gun still in one hand, as if to fire. \nBefore he can, Grace grabs up the hatchet from the floor and drives it straight into his back. \nHe gurgles, stunned from both sides, but it's like trying to kill Rasputin. He still has the gun as Bobby jumps him from the rear, trying to get his neck in a chokehold. The gun FIRES once, discharging into the wall. The hatchet is ripped from his back. \nGrace watches as the two men bang into the walls in a rugged rodeo-type fight, Jake seeking to dislodge Bobby off his back. An expression of fear and excitement in her eyes. \nFinally the two men go crashing to the ground, rolling around, Bobby maintaining his stranglehold, but calling to her, his hands full. \nBOBBY Grace, goddamit, do something! \nJake's eyes rolls up at her like a beaching whale, pleading for help. \nJAKE Grace...? \nShe commits. Jumping into the fray, it's not clear whose side she's really on as the three of them roll across the floor, strangling, biting, hitting, spitting, scratching, gasping. It's a Guignol, but the pressure from Bobby's forearm is taking its toll on Jake. Trying to bite Jake, Grace bites Bobby instead, but then she scratches Jake's face. Jake is grabbing her hard as Bobby chokes him, trying to use her to leverage himself away. But she manages to rip herself from his grip and scrambles on her knees across the floor. \nShe grabs the hatchet. And stands, moving back towards the two men locked on the floor. Bobby looks up at her, hatchet in hand, no longer sure which way she'll go. \nJake, however, gasping for air, eyes bulging, spittle dripping from his mouth, looks at Grace with some inner certainty that she will help him. He gasps the words. \nJAKE Help me, Grace, help... \nGRACE Like you helped her, Jake? \nGrace stands there, deciding, the power of the hatchet in her hands. She raises it suddenly over the two men. \nIt flashes downwards. Deep into the gut of her husband Jake, almost transfixing him to the floor. \nIn the silence that follows, Jake's eyes roll up to meet hers. But all she has for him is a cold, distant stare. \nJake's head drops as the life rushes out of him. Bobby falls back from the body puffing and dripping with sweat. \nBOBBY Figgers. There's a scratch on the hood and how much you make selling my gun? Deduct it. \nBobby pulls the hundred back from Darrell's grasp. \nDARRELL (going to get the keys) Don't know nothing about no gun. \nBOBBY Course you don't. Tell me something Darrell. Forty thousand people die every day! How come none of them are you? \nDARRELL (throws him the keys) I think you know where to find her. \nBOBBY And the trunk key. \nDARRELL (pulls out the trunk key) Topped off the tank for you. No charge. Just my way of doing business. \nBOBBY (jovial, confident now) Listen up good, Darrell. I'm getting outta this shithole. You're staying! And one little peep outta you -- remember that gun makes you part of the food chain. Your prints are all over it. I'd be awful careful whose rectum I was pointing my finger in, Darrell. \nBobby hops in the car, a free man. As Darrell glares at him, bewildered and frightened at the same time. \nEXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - NIGHT \nBOBBY turns the MUSTANG up the drive. THE HEADLIGHTS cut the darkness and land on an empty patch where Grace's jeep had been parked.  Bobby jumps from the Mustang and runs around frantically. His look is devastated. He falls to his knees, about to sob when: \nGRACE opens the front door and pokes her head out, putting out several suitcases. \nGRACE Bobby?  What the hell's the matter with you? \nBOBBY I ... nothing.  I just stubbed my toe on a rock.  Hurt like hell. \nGRACE I got the money all packed.  I put the jeep and his caddy in the garage. People'll think maybe me and Jake went away.  Buy us some time...I know a back road we can take. \nBOBBY Good thinking. (looking at her four bags) What's all this? \nGRACE I'm not coming back. \nBOBBY (accepting) Awright, let's go. I want to be fifty miles from here before the sun comes up. \nGRACE Funny thing; the jeep wouldn't start. I had to push it. \nBOBBY (dryly) Funny thing... I'll get the bags. \nEXT. MCKENNA HOUSE - LATER NIGHT \nBobby's MUSTANG is backed towards the front of the house.  We see a silhouette of BOBBY and GRACE carrying something wrapped in a BLANKET and dumping it in the trunk. \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nA lone pair of HEADLIGHTS illuminate the night as the Mustang cruises through the dark.  As the lights brighten the screen we: \nFADE TO: \nINT./EXT. MUSTANG - NIGHT \nGRACE sits next to BOBBY peering out the windshield, clutching the money in a backpack. She's humming an Indian song. \nBOBBY I can't see it. \nGRACE It should be just up ahead.  Hold on ... there!  There it is! \nA SIGN illuminated by the HEADLIGHTS.  It reads:  YOU ARE LEAVING SUPERIOR.  THANKS FOR VISITING. \nGrace lets out a scream of joy, leans over and hugs him. \nGRACE Oh, God!  I can't believe it.  I'm out. I'm finally out! \nThe MUSTANG begins to swerve along the road. \nBOBBY Hey!  Take it easy.  Want to get us killed? \nGRACE You don't know what it feels like to be free of that place. \nBOBBY I don't know about that? \nGRACE You spent a day in Superior. I wasted my entire life there. I feel like someone just took a million pounds off my shoulders. \nBOBBY We've still got some dead weight to get rid of. \nGRACE Can't we just dump him fast someplace? \nBOBBY I want a place where only the vultures will find him...(then) It'll be over soon, Grace. \nGRACE Then will you take me on your friends' boat with you? \nBOBBY I'm not sailing his boat. \nSHERIFF (hurt) Oh Grace, you can say what you want...but, I watched you fuck that pervert for years while you're telling me you loved me? What happened to going to Milwaukee together? You and me -- gonna open up the finest sporting goods store that city ever did see? Get us a place on the north shore, by the lake? Season Brewer tickets! Just you and me, Grace. What happened? \nGRACE All talk, that's all you did was talk, and all I did was sit around getting older waiting for you to free me! You never did nothin' Virgil, you're weak! (pointing to Bobby) He did! \nThe Sheriff, deeply wounded, casts a hot vicious gaze on Bobby. \nSHERIFF This is some girl you and me got here Bobby, yessir, an excellent cocksuck too, wouldn't you say? (back at Grace)... Course you had a lotta practice haven't you darling, going way back to your crazy mama! \nGRACE (deadly) Shut up, Virgil! Take your share of the money. It's not so bad. \nSHERIFF I don't want the fuckin' money! I'm not gonna give up everything I got for a lousy 50,000 dollars. It's you. You Grace or nothing. The whole thing... I want you to be my wife...(hopeful). What do you way Grace? \nGRACE You sound just like Jake... I did see into the future, Virgil, but you weren't in it. Go back to your family. They love you. \nBobby gets out of the car, misunderstanding the situation. \nBOBBY (misunderstanding) Look, we got more. We got $200,000 at least. Split it three ways, we all walk away... \nThe Sheriff snaps and smashes Bobby with his flashlight, knocking him to the ground, kicking him again and again, gathering the psychic force to murder him. Grace tries to approach. \nSHERIFF Shut up, boy! You don't know shit round here! (to Grace) Get back. Did she tell you that story about the bird flying away? \nBOBBY (rolling on the ground) Ow! Look, I ... ow! \nGRACE Stop! Stop it! \nSHERIFF (kicking again and again) Were you going to help her fly away, asshole? What'd you think, you were the first boy to drift through this town she came on to? She tell you the story about old Jake forcing her to marry him? That's a good story... How he killed her crazy Mama? \nBobby in bloody agony. Grace stunned that Virgil would reveal this now publicly. \nGRACE Goddamnit Virgil, stop!  Don't! \nSHERIFF ...But I bet the story she didn't tell you was the best story of all. How old crazy Jake was really her Papa. And she liked fucking Papa! And now she's killed the sonufabitch! Just like she's gonna kill you! \nGrace plunges into the pack, pulls the gun and shoots Virgil across the car in the gut. \nGRACE No...you! You! \nThe Sheriff flies back onto the road, stunned, not realizing what's happened. \nBobby watches unbelieving as Grace quietly steps up over the Sheriff. \nShe puts the next round in his nuts, a modern fury enacting ancient wrath. \nBOBBY Grace. No! \nThe Sheriff is wide-eyed, dying in shock. Grace then fires right at his head in a coup de grace that blows his brains out the back of his head. \nGrace and Bobby both stare, then Grace jumps into action, dragging the body. She snaps to Bobby. \nGRACE Help me get him off the road. Into the car! We'll ditch his car... Get the fuck up! \nBobby stares at her. \nEXT./INT. MUSTANG - NIGHT \nThey're driving. GRACE and BOBBY, wordless, each thinking in separate worlds. Grace wipes her hands. The bag with the money between her legs. The Baretta is back in the bag. \nBOBBY (finally) Jesus, did you have to kill him? \nGRACE Get real Bobby. He was gonna kill you and me. \nBOBBY He was in love with you Grace. He would've done what you wanted, you could've made a deal and ... \nGRACE The only deal he had in mind was killing you for Jake's murder and blackmailing me into sucking his dick for the rest of my life... no thanks. \nBOBBY He was a cop, Grace, they never stop looking for you when you kill a cop... \nGRACE He was a scumbag!... He wanted me, Bobby. These guys don't let go! Even when they're dead... (softer) You don't know what it was like, Bobby. Those two, they were the same. \nA silence. The oncoming road. \nGRACE So, aren't you going to ask me? \nBOBBY Ask you what? You mean what kind of horrifying sick shit is coming next? \nGRACE Don't you want to know...? I bet it's burning a hole in your brain just now? \nBOBBY Let it go, baby. It's the past. I got a past... \nGRACE Don't you really want to know? Was Jake my Daddy? Was I fucking my own Daddy? Don't you want to know that? \nBOBBY (shouting) What do you want me to say! \nHer eyes go to the gun in his hand and she stops laughing. Her calm is extraordinary, as if expecting to die. \nGRACE Well? \nFor a moment, Bobby does nothing, then he slips the gun through his belt. \nBOBBY Well, nothing. We dump Jake, we split the money, then you're on your own. \nGRACE Don't leave me. I want to say with you, Bobby. \nBOBBY Why? So when the cops catch up with us you can sell me out again? \nGRACE I was just baiting him! Bobby, I had to tell him that to get his guard down. Just like you told Jake you was going to kill me! \nBOBBY You lied to me all along! Lies, all lies. Your mother, your father, what story are you on now?  How come the town didn't know you was his daughter? \nGRACE (in pain) Cause my Mom slept around. A lotta men! Anybody could've been my father. But we knew. \nBOBBY (not listening) Well you got what you wanted all along by fucking me.  I wish you had told me the goddamn truth in the first place! \nGRACE (screws out) I didn't want you to know! Don't you... unnerstand? \nBobby's got a headache now. It's too much to understand, too much talk. Too much history has taught him to doubt. \nBOBBY When you're finished with me, I'm next! I been there, baby. I been there with other cunts...sorry, not anymore. I'll take you as far as California. If we can make that. After that you're on your own. Try Mexico. With all this bread, you can live like a queen. \nGRACE I don't want to go to Mexico, Bobby! Please, I really want to be with you. Don't blow this. Don't you think I care about you? \nBOBBY I think you're a lying, back-stabbing psycho bitch, and one day you'll kill me. But it's nice to know you cared... \nThe expression on Grace's face changes as rapidly as the desert weather, a coldness passing over and through her. \nGRACE You don't know your own mind. It blocks your heart. \nKeeping a wary eye on Grace, Bobby starts hauling Jake out of the trunk. \nBOBBY Give me a hand. \nHe wrestles Jake up to a sitting position. He grabs a can of beer from a warm six-pack in the trunk and shoves it into a pocket of Jake's coat. \nBOBBY Poor old Jake, a few drinks, a fight with the sheriff over his wife. And both of 'em ended up dead. \nGrace takes his boots. \nBOBBY Time to go for a walk, Jake. \nGRACE My mother died in this canyon. \nBOBBY Save the Mom routine, will ya Grace. It doesn't work with me. One, two, three... \nThey lift the corpse, and with great effort, haul it towards the edge of the drop. As they pause on the way, Bobby, wary of Grace's strange coldness, tries to soften the blow of separation. \nBOBBY Look, it's not so bad we split up. It might be months before they find these guys. If at all. I mean with the mountain lions around here. Remember, if they can't find no bodies, there's no crime... (She doesn't respond.) We'll be in Phoenix by noon. Lose this car, get another one. Texas, Mexico are big countries, all that money Grace, you'll meet someone else, you know, there's a lot of hope with a $100,000... \nThey lift Jake again, and move to the edge. \nGRACE Hope is a four-letter word. \nBOBBY But we all need that too. Hold him. \nHe props Jake at the edge, standing, and transfers the weight onto Grace. Jake's head is on her shoulder. \nBOBBY You make a pretty couple. \nIt seems he might push them both over but instead takes the gun, wipes it of his prints, and slips it through Jake's belt. \nBOBBY Won this in a poker game in Reno. God knows who it's registered to.  You shoulda been more careful, Jake. See you later. \nAs he takes Jake's weight off Grace and pushes it over the drop. \nGrace watches him go, her eyes shifting to Bobby, his back momentarily to her, also watching. She moves towards him. \nBobby turns, slips on the edge. \nBOBBY Now all we got to do is try and-- \nHe feels a blur of motion, almost like a bird, and he is falling...falling, his life coming to an end. \nGrace is standing somewhere up above, briefly seen. Did she push him? He doesn't know. \nHe's stunned as he falls on the rocks next to the bodies of Jake and Virgil. He screams out in sharp pain. His leg feels broken. But he is alive. \nGrace walks away, cutting it all off, deeply shaken. She must get away from the past and all these hollow men. She closes the trunk of the Mustang, gets in the driver's seat, reaches for the ignition key. Her hand fumbles for it a moment. It isn't there. \n", "test1_input": "GRACE It's just new drapes and curtain rods.  If I had known it was going to be so heavy I would have had them delivered up to the house. \nBobby struggles with the package.  Sweat starts to sheet his face. \nBOBBY (panting) That a fact? \nGRACE I just got tired of looking at the old drapes. My mother made them. Had them long as I can remember. You ever seen something and just knew you had to have it? \nBOBBY (straining) Yes, I have. \nGRACE 'Course they cost a little more than I should really be spending.  But, damn it, I don't hardly ever do anything nice for myself.  I deserve nice things. \nBOBBY (can hardly talk) I ... can't ... argue ... \nThey arrive at a JEEP SAHARA. \nGRACE This is it. \nBobby practically drops the package.  He is covered with sweat. \nGRACE Thank you, Bobby. \nBOBBY You're welcome, Grace. \nGRACE You're not from around here, are you? \nBOBBY Why you say that?  Just because I help a lady with her package? \nGRACE You don't have that dead look in your eyes like the only thing you live for is to get through the day. \nBOBBY I just drove in this morning. \nGRACE Drove into Superior?  What for? \nBOBBY Didn't have a choice.  My car overheated up the road. \nGRACE You're lucky you didn't break down in the desert.  Day like today, you'd be dead in no time. When you leaving? \nBOBBY Not until my car's fixed.  I don't know how long that's going to take. \nGRACE And here I've made you all hot and sweaty. \nGrace steps to Bobby and places her hand against his chest.  She rubs away some of the sweat. They look at each other a beat. A POLICE CAR, seen earlier, pulls up beside them from behind and idles. SHERIFF VIRGIL POTTER is a weathered, handsome, middle-aged man with suspicious eyes, black haired in contrast to Bobby's sandiness. \nSHERIFF Morning Grace. \nGRACE Morning Sheriff. Got my drapes. \nSHERIFF Well it's about time. Looks like you found yourself a helper too. \nBobby wants to shrink behind the drapes. \nGRACE Well, he offered, and I just couldn't refuse. His car overheated. \nSHERIFF Oh? \nBobby turns to the Sheriff and forces a smile. \nBOBBY Morning, officer. \nSHERIFF Son. (beat, to Grace) Little excitement out at the reservation this morning. Wayne and Dale Elkhart were up drinking all night and then Wayne starts chasing Dale around the desert with his shotgun. BIA handled it. I went by for backup. \nGRACE Anybody hurt? \nSHERIFF Hell, no. That Wayne can't shoot when he's sober, much less drunk. He's lucky he didn't kill his own danged self. (beat) Well, anyhow, you stay cool. Nice meeting you, son. \nBOBBY Same here, officer. \nThe Sheriff drives on.  Pause.  They look at each other. \nGRACE Well, I guess I could use some help getting this box into the house.  Not far. You could shower, get something cool to drink. \nBobby considers the offer, but there's not much considering to do. \nBOBBY Well, I could use something cool. \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY \nBOBBY rides along with GRACE in her JEEP. \nGRACE Where you coming from? \nBOBBY All over.  Chicago, Houston, Detroit.  Just lately Dallas. \n", "test1_true": "BOBBY I guess I've got wander in my blood. \nGRACE Where you headed? \nBOBBY I don't know.  I have to make a stop in Vegas.  Business to finish.  Then maybe I'll head to Santa Barbara.  I might be able to pick up some action there. \nGRACE So, what is it you do, Mister...? \nBOBBY Cooper. Bobby Cooper. Oh you know, whatever pays best. Little bartending, used to teach tennis, played a little competition ... (drops it). \nGRACE I never played tennis. You just travel around Bobby-- no direction, no steady work.  You must like taking chances. \nBOBBY If you're going to gamble, might as well play for high stakes. \nGRACE What happens when you lose? \nBOBBY I pack up and go somewhere else. \nGRACE (wistfully) Somewhere else.  I've never been anywhere else.  Just once.  Years ago.  Went to the State Fair. It was nice, but it wasn't nothing. \nBOBBY I couldn't stay in this place.  I wouldn't. I'd just pick up, do whatever I had to do, and get out. \nGrace looks to Bobby and smiles. \nGRACE Sometimes I feel the exact same way. \nINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - LATER - DAY \nBOBBY, naked, steps into the shower and turns on the water.  It shoots from the shower head and cascades over his body.  As the water falls over him we hear a Russian accented voice: \nVOICE(V.O.) I want my money. \nBobby press his left hand against the white tile to steady himself.  His hand is curled in such a way we cannot see his pinky or ring finger.  Bobby leans back in the shower.  Just as he does: \nEXT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nIt is raining hard.  Matching the backwards motion of the last scene BOBBY is thrown violently against a brick wall, facing out. \nVOICE(V.O.) I want my money. \nBOBBY Look, I'll get the money! You don't want to do this! \nVOICE (V.O.) Take two for now. One a week, punk... \nBobby is being pressed against the wall by two muscular GOONS. Another MAN stands partially hidden behind the goon's frame. With one hand one goon flattens Bobby's hand against the brick, with his other he clips two fingers off with a GARDEN SHEAR. We see Bobby's face in agonizing pain, then he slides screaming to the ground until he is framed between the legs of the men. \nAs Bobby clutches his left hand the rainwater runs in streaks down his ashen, blank face. \nINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nWe see BOBBY's face reliving the experience as once again we hear the voice. \nVOICE (V.O.) Two weeks, asshole. Get the money or you gonna lose your nose and ears. \nBobby has slumped to the floor of the shower, looking to his left hand, almost crying, unable to tolerate it.  As a streak of blood snakes down the white tile we see that the pinky and ring FINGERS have been cut off at the joints. \nINT. GRACE'S BEDROOM/BATHROOM - DAY \nBOBBY, his hand rebandaged, is putting on his clothes. \nBOBBY (to himself) You're still lucky. \nAs he does he looks at himself in the mirror.  He bends to pick up his shirt which is draped over the gym bag.  As he lifts it we can see, perhaps more closely than at the garage, that the bag is 3/4 filled with money.  He closes the bag and stands.  In the MIRROR, hidden in the doorway, he sees GRACE watching him.  Bobby slows perceptibly, but does not try to hide himself.  After a moment Grace walks into the room carrying a glass of lemonade. \nGRACE Thought you might like a refill on your lemonade. \nBobby takes the lemonade and drinks it down.  He rubs the glass against his forehead. \nBOBBY That's good.  Cools you right off. (tentatively) I saw you watching me. \nGRACE I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to. \nBOBBY I didn't say it bothered me. \nGRACE Did you like it; me watching you? \nBOBBY I guess.  I've got an ego same as any man. \nGRACE Good, 'cause I liked what I saw. \nBobby gives a smile as devilish as it is pleasant. Grace slides an ice cube from the glass between her lips. He notices a framed picture of GRACE and an OLDER MAN. \n", "test1_id": 2619, "test2_input": "SECOND BIKER The dinero, Senora.  Hand it over. \nBobby shifts his weight trying to hide his pack behind his back. \nThe woman goes to an old-fashioned cash register and rings it open.  She hands the money to the biker. \nBIKER That's it?  Lady, I got kids to put through school. \nWOMAN Es all I have. \nThe biker turns to Bobby. \nBIKER Okay, pal.  Whatcha got? Give it, now. \nBobby pulls a thick wad of cash ($1,000 plus) from his pant pocket, tosses it on the counter. \nBIKER (thumbing through it, impressed) Nice...Just who are you beautiful? What else you got for papa? \nBobby makes a show of pulling out his wallet, flings it to him. \nBIKER Better...you're getting tasty. Now toss the bag, sweetie. \nBOBBY It's just books. \nBIKER I'm a reader. Toss it. \nBOBBY (an entreaty) It's personal things...family things. \nBIKER How touching...I like family values. Give it to me. \nBobby takes an unsteady breath. \nBOBBY No. \nBIKER No? \nSECOND BIKER Hey man, forget it. Come on. \nBIKER No? \nWOMAN Senor, give him the bag. \nBIKER That's all right. He doesn't want to give me the bag... \nSECOND BIKER He's fucking with you man. Shoot him. \nBIKER (cont'd) ...he doesn't have to give me the bag. \nThe biker grabs Bobby's bag. Bobby flinches in anticipation of a shot but refuses to let go of the bag.  The biker swings the gun hard, clipping Bobby across the forehead.  Bobby falls against the counter and to the floor.  The woman starts to scream. The biker grabs up the pack, then, looking back at the woman, sees a ring on her finger.  He grabs her hand and pulls at the ring. The woman screams wildly. \nSECOND BIKER Let's go, man. \nBIKER A little extra never hurt, Benji, would you just relax. \nWOMAN No!  No! My wedding ring. \nHe pulls the ring from the woman's finger and pushes her back. With Bobby's bag slung over his shoulder he turns to leave. \nBIKER Now we go. \nWOMAN You go to El Diablo! \nFrom beneath the counter the woman pulls a shotgun. The woman fires A SHOT that rips through the bag and into the back of the biker.  He falls to the ground, very dead, amid a shower of blood and shredded money. \nSECOND BIKER Bugger! You bitch! \nThe Second Biker now sees the money floating all over the place out of the torn bag. His eyes go big with greed as he FIRES at the old woman, who ducks behind the counter. \nThe Biker grabs for the bag and what's left of the money, not expecting the feisty old lady to pop up and unload her SECOND BLAST into him and the bag. \nWhatever was left of the money on the first round is now gone to shreds along with the bag and the Biker who is very dead. \nBobby is staggered, crawls towards the shreds. \nWOMAN (cursing in Spanish) Hijos de puta. Bayan a comer su propia mierda en el infierno. (TRANSLATION: Sons of bitches. Go eat your own shit in hell). \nShe comes around the counter to his side as he grabs his wallet and the $1000 cash roll from the dead biker's pants. \nWOMAN I call the sheriff. \nBOBBY No! No police. \nBobby gives her a hundred dollars. \n", "test2_true": "Bobby gives her some more cash. She looks at him. Finally he gives her the entire wad. \nBOBBY No police until I leave. \nBobby stumbles from the store as the screen burns a bright white. \nFADE TO: \nEXT. STREET - LATER \nBOBBY, dazed and holding his head, sits on the ground next to a SPIGOT that is dripping water.  He cups his hands under the water and splashes it against his face, lightly wiping the cut above his eye. The SHERIFF'S CAR goes wailing by on the main drag. Recoiling from being spotted, Bobby tries to take another drink. A SCORPION crawls out of the faucet. He jumps back. \nEXT. HARLIN'S GARAGE - LATER \nDARRELL is leaning under the hood of a car working on its engine as BOBBY walks up. \nBOBBY Hey. \nDARRELL Hey, your ... what the hell happened to you? \nBOBBY Nothing. \nDARRELL Don't look like nothing. \nBOBBY Just banged my head.  It was an accident. \nDARRELL Another accident?  You got to be more careful. \nBobby rolls his eyes. Then notices the front fenders have been removed. \nBOBBY What the hell happened to my car? \nDARRELL Bottom hose was shot too.  Rotted clear through. Had to put a new one in. Runs like a dream now. \nBOBBY (suspicious) How much? \nDARRELL Well ... you got your parts, you got your labour ... let's call it a hundred-fifty bucks. \nBOBBY How much!? \nDARRELL Hundred-fifty. \nBOBBY To replace a goddamn radiator hose!? \nDARRELL A goddamn radiator hose in a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.  You know how long it took me to find that hose? \nBOBBY About an hour and a half, because that's all the longer I've been gone. \nDARRELL Actually, it's been about three hours. You're the one thinks that car's so damn fancy.  What you expect but fancy damn prices? \nBOBBY That's a Ford, not a Ferrari.  You going to tell me no one else in this shit hole drives a Ford? \nDARRELL \"That's not just a Ford, that's a sixty-four-and-a-half Mustang.\" \nBOBBY What's that got to do with the radiator hose? \nDARRELL I don't know, but \"it's the reason I'm living here and you're just passing through.\"  Now you owe me a hundred-fifty dollars. \nBOBBY It might as well be fifteen-hundred dollars, because I don't have the money. \nDARRELL Then you ain't gonna have the car. \nBOBBY Listen, man.  I got rolled half an hour ago for everything I had. \nBobby digs through his bloodied wallet, trying to hide it from Darrell. He fishes out a five dollar bill. Then digs out a bloody one dollar bill from his pocket. \nBOBBY I've got five...six dollars. \nDarrell snatches the five from him and adds it to a thick wad of greasy bills he carries in his overalls. \nDARRELL Then you're only a hundred-forty-five in the hole.  You can keep that dollar. Now why don't you just take your American Express Gold Card, and call that guy with the big schnooz on TV and have him send you the money lickity split. \nBOBBY I don't have a goddamn credit card. \nDARRELL Now that's too bad.  I sure hope you know how to wash dishes or shovel shit 'cause you're gonna have to work this one off. \nBobby proffers his Movado watch. \nBOBBY Look, I got a Movado.  It's worth at least seven, eight hundred. You could sell it for that. \nDARRELL (studying it) Who the hell to? Shit, can't see no numbers. \n", "test2_id": 2620, "test3_input": "MR. ARKADY Do you understand me you little fuck? \nBOBBY (snaps) Oh, fuck you too! \nMR. ARKADY What'd you say to me! \nBOBBY Shit I'm sorry!...you can't believe the strain I'm under. I'm just under a lot of strain here. \nThere is a sharp silence at the other end. Bobby waits. \nMR. ARKADY Bobby, you owed me that 'bread' 4 weeks ago. Now you tell me you want another week. That's 5 weeks, Bobby. That's also 5 fingers, cause you and I know it's a finger a week Bobby. So you got balls. Good--now you come here tomorrow and you talk to me real nice and maybe I don't take the other 3 fingers you owe me, you see? Tomorrow -- and Bobby, don't make me come look for you, okay...have nice day. \nHe hands the phone back to Sergei. \nSERGEI (into phone) You got that? -- have nice day (hangs up). \nMR. ARKADY The nerva that piece of shit! And look at you, you Neanderthal -- don't you fuckin' break pencils, you goombah! \nSOFIA Finger? What are you, a faggot? In my country a man don't pay we cut off his head. \nArkady motions Sergei to come close. \nMR. ARKADY Get your ass down to this Superior, Arizona. Bring me this Bobby Cooper. I don't think he got the lesson. This is your last chance, Sergei. \nSERGEI Da. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nBOBBY, desperate, stares at the bandage of his wounded hand. It throbs, holding the hand to his ear. \nWe hear an OPERATOR'S VOICE: \nOPERATOR(V.O.) Hello? \nBOBBY Hello? \nOPERATOR(V.O.) Are you finished with your call? \nBOBBY Yeah. \nOPERATOR(V.O.) Please deposit an additional seventy-five cents. \nBobby slams the phone against the hook. \nBOBBY Goddamn rat's ass fuck! Shit! Damn! Damn! Damn! \nHe marches from the phone booth, past an old HARDWARE STORE. The phone falls from the hook and we hear a recorded voice: \nVOICE(V.O.) Thank you for using AT&T. \nIn the store window, Bobby notices a set of garden shears for sale. \nEXT. EMPTY STREET - LATER DAY \nBOBBY walks a bit going nowhere in particular.  Looking at his watch thinking of Mr. Arkady, he shields himself with one hand from the sun.  At the side of an old building, in the bit of shade it throws, he twists at the beer cap which sticks and won't turn.  Bobby tries again twisting harder -- too hard -- as the cap jerkily twists off, cutting into his hand as it rotates. Bobby yells in pain.  At the same time the beer comes foaming from the bottle and spills onto his sleeve. The bottle slips from his wet fingers and crashes on the ground, emptying. He clutches his bleeding hand, pissed. \nBOBBY Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! I hate this fuckin' town! I hate it! Do you hear me? (no answer) Get me outta here, please.  I gotta get out of this place. \nAs if in answer, a JEEP drives by on the main street. GRACE looks pretty hot up there in the driver's seat, her eyes, behind sunglasses, flicking over him but not acknowledging him as she keeps going. \nBobby's eyes throw back his own hostility at her, but unfortunately she misses it, as he now notices -- across the street -- a well-kept building with the most modern decor and signage, reading \"McKenna's Realty Co.\" \nHe thinks about it, in a quandary. \nEXT. HIGHWAY/CAR - DAY \nIn a rented convertible, we now see SERGEI racing across the desert. His jacket off, a man with a mission. He glances at his watch, eager to get to this \"fucking hole in the wall\" which is somewhere on this incomprehensible American map he holds in one hand. \nINT. JAKE'S REALTY OFFICE - DAY \nBOBBY squats, looking at a real estate model of a desert development. JAKE smiles. \nJAKE What can I do for you, lad? \nBOBBY I was hoping we could talk. \nJAKE Talk?  About what? \nBOBBY About things.  About your wife. \nJAKE Sweet Grace?  What about her? \nBOBBY About what you said this morning. \n", "test3_true": "BOBBY You said you had an insurance policy out on your wife.  Fifty-thousand dollars. \nJAKE I do. \nBOBBY You said you'd cut that up with the man who did her in. \nJAKE I did? \nBOBBY Don't play simple with me, Jake. You're a betting man. You want me to spell it out for you? I'll kill Grace if you cut me in on the money. \nJAKE Boy I think this heat's getting to you the way you're rambling on. \nBOBBY I'm not rambling. \nJAKE You're talking like a madman. \nBOBBY Well then, I guess that qualifies me for citizenship in this town. You're the one brought it up. This morning. In your car. \nJAKE Oh, that was just loose talk. Husband gettin' pissed off.  I don't want anybody dead. \nBOBBY Bullshit.  You wanted me to kill her. \nJAKE A man doesn't always mean the things he says. \nBOBBY You meant it. \nJAKE What makes you say that? \nBOBBY Because you're a slimy bastard who would have his wife killed just to get his hands on some money. \nJAKE And what does that make you? \nBOBBY The slimy bastard who's going to do it for you... (pause) You're a jealous man Jake. If you can't have Grace to yourself...well, you're not the sharing kind. \nFor a moment Jake stares quietly at Bobby. \nJAKE Well, I guess I have what you call a love-hate relationship with Grace. \nBOBBY You love her, but you hate her? \nJAKE No, I hate loving her. I hate the kind of person she is. I hate having to tolerate the little \"games\" she plays. Like fucking half of the town behind my back and laughing at me. The bitch. She loved to play. She wants me to hit her and when I hit her she likes it. She tortures me. But she's family. She's my little girl. My baby. I couldn't stand to watch her eyes roll back in her head as she sucks her last breath, or to see her pretty pink brains spill from her skull. No. Not me. But you? You got the killing in you, boy...How much you want? \nA pause. \nBOBBY Make it twenty. \nJAKE (stressed, paces) Twenty-thousand?  I don't have that kind of money.  I won't get the insurance until months after she's dead.  I don't imagine you'll want to be stickin' around after poor Grace's demise.  Twenty-thousand; that's more money than I could ever get my hands on. \nBOBBY How much could you get? \nJAKE Maybe ... ten-thousand.  And that's a maybe. \nBOBBY I need thirteen. \nJAKE That's a bit much. \nBOBBY We're not talking about buying a car Jake. We're talking about killing your wife. It's thirteen, or it's nothing. \nFor a moment the two men stand silent.  All we hear is the ticking of a grandfather CLOCK that stands in the corner. \nJAKE You drive a hard bargain, but I had a feeling you were my boy when I met you. \nBOBBY I'm not your boy.  I don't like you.  I got no choice but to do business with you. Let's just call this a nasty little marriage of convenience. \nJAKE Don't say that.  I had a marriage of convenience with Grace, and look where that's lead...  Well, looks like we got ourselves a contract. \nBOBBY (sarcastic) Do we shake hands? \nJAKE If you can't trust the man you've hired to kill your wife ...? The thing is it's got to look like an accident; that's the thing. If it doesn't, then it's no good.  I won't get a dime, and it's my neck that'll be on the chopping block while you're living it up somewhere. \nBOBBY How do you want it? \nJAKE How the hell should I know?  I've never had a wife killed before. Jesus Christ! You want this job, you don't know how to do this? I guess I should have hired a professional. \nBOBBY You want to do this yourself?  I don't have to do this, you know. \nJAKE Be quiet, boy.  I got to figure this thing. I'm thinking. It can't be done at the house. It should be... \nJake walks the office thinking. \nBOBBY Come to think of it, how 'bout some money upfront? \n", "test3_id": 2621}

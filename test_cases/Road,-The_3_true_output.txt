MAN. We have to keep moving. Other people might be attracted to the waterfall just like we were. We wouldn't hear them coming. They stop to look at a lake surrounded by fog down in the 
VALLEY 
BOY. Do you think there could be fish in the lake? 
MAN. No. There's nothing in the lake. They move on. 
EXT. BACK ROAD - DAY 
They come around a bend in the road and immediately hear the ROAR of river rapids. Up ahead they see a bridge with a jack- knifed TRUCK on it. 
EXT. BRIDGE - DAY 
They walk out onto the bridge over GREY FROTHING WATER, and inspect the truck. The tyres are flat, the cab jammed against the railings. The trailer end has swung across the road, knocked out the railings and lies with it's last few feet hanging over the side of the bridge, blocking the bridge off completely. 
EXT. ABANDONED TRUCK - DAY 
The MAN climbs up onto the gas tanks, wipes the glass and peers into the cab. He swings the door open and climbs inside, pulling the door shut behind. 
INT. TRUCK/CAB - DAY 
He looks around at discarded detritus, old magazines and trash. He checks behind the seats where there is a mattress on a bunk and calls out. 
MAN. Come up here. 
INT. TRUCK/CAB - (CAMP 7) - NIGHT 
SNOW continues to fall on the dusty WINDSCREEN. Outside, all around snow falls, silently, covering the truck and the bridge, transforming it. They are both still awake, unable to sleep, staring at the transformed world, carpeted by snow. 
BOY. I'm hungry. 
MAN. I know. So am I. 
BOY. Can I ask you something? 
MAN. Of course. 
BOY. Are we going to die? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MAN. No. Sometime. Not now. 
BOY. And we're still going south? 
MAN. Yes. 
BOY. So we'll be warm? 
MAN. Yes. 
BOY. And there might be food there? 
MAN. Everything depends on reaching the coast. 
BOY. Okay. The MAN draws a blanket around him and kisses him goodnight, it is now pitch black. 
MAN. Go to sleep. 
BOY. I wish I was with my mom. They are silent a moment, until: 
MAN. You mean you wish you were dead. 
BOY. Yeah. 
MAN. You mustn't say that. It's a bad thing to say. 
BOY. I can't help it.

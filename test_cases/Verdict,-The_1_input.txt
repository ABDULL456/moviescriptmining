INT. LAW LIBRARY - NIGHT 
Galvin and Mickey at a library table piled with books. A dingy, dusty law library. They are smoking, speak in undertones, referring to the yellow legal pads in front of them. Rehashing material. 
MICKEY Who have we got? 
GALVIN We've got her sister. Testifies she had a meal one hour before she was admitted to the hospital. This is the point. 
MICKEY You got the admittance form says patient ate nine hours prior to admittance. 
GALVIN Admittance form is wrong. 
MICKEY Forget it. You can't prove it. Sister's testimony is no good. Jury knows we win she gets the cash. 
GALVIN I've got my Dr. Gruber, says her heart condition means they gave her the wrong anesthetic anyway, plus she came in complaining of stomach pains... 
MICKEY (conceding) ...Gruber's not bad. 
GALVIN Not bad...? This guy's Dr. Kildare, the jury's going to love him, Mick... And you calm down, all right? Their guy, Towler's, the author of the book, (hunts for book on desk, holds it up; reads) 'Methodology and Practice, Anesthesiology.' (rummages through a pile of papers on the desk) ...and they got depositions from the nurses, everybody in the operating room, the scrub-nurse... 'All these guys are God. I saw them walk on water...' (checking a list) They had an obstetrical nurse in there. We got a deposition from the obstetrical nurse? 
MICKEY (checking list) No. 
GALVIN (reading from pad) 'Mary Rooney, forty-nine. Lives in Arlington, still working at the hospital.' Can you get out tomorrow? How come she isn't speaking up. 
MICKEY Right. 
GALVIN Okay now. Cases: Smith versus State of Michigan. 
MICKEY Right. 
GALVIN Brindisi versus Electric Boat. 
MICKEY You got a good memory, Franky. 
GALVIN I had a good teacher. McLean versus Urban Transport... 
INT. O'ROURKE'S PUB - NIGHT 
Galvin and Mickey entering the bar, walk over to the bar. 
Galvin sees something O.S. Call to the bartender. 
GALVIN Jimmy? Bushmills. (turns to Mickey, whispers) Lookit, do me a favor. I'll buy you a drink tomorrow. 
MICKEY Yeah? And what are you going to do tonight? 
GALVIN I'm going to get laid. 
Galvin motions with his head down at the end of the bar. 
ANGLE - P.O.V. 
The Woman from last night, sitting in her same place at the end of the bar. Mickey looks at her. Shrugs. Gets up off stool. 
MICKEY Don't leave your best work in the sheets. 
He salutes, walks off. 
Galvin takes his drink and moves down to her. 
GALVIN D'you find an apartment? 
LAURA Still looking. 
GALVIN I changed my life today. What did you do? 
LAURA I changed my room at the Hotel. 
GALVIN Why? 
LAURA The TV didn't work.

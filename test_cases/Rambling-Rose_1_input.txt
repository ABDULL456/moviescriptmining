DADDY (icily polite) Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar? 
MOTHER (embarrassed) Honey, please... 
DR. MARTINSON (a thin unpleasant smile) It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically. 
MOTHER It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth. 
MR. MARTINSON (tries to make a supercilious joke) Her entire mouth is a cavity, Madam, ha ha ha. 
DADDY (dryly, doesn't like the man a bit) Ha ha ha ha. 
Mother frowns at Daddy and Dr. Martinson gives him an aloof glance. 
DR. MARTINSON (with spurious dignity) The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment. 
DADDY That's all I want to know. (rises) Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt. 
MOTHER Yes, thank you, Doctor. 
DR. MARTINSON (as they leave) I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean "epi-zoo-ot-tics," an animal epidemic? 
DADDY (icily polite, from the door) No, I mean epizootics. 
INT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT 
CUT TO a shot of Mother, Daddy, Buddy, Doll and Waski as Daddy comes out of the Doctor's office and shuts the door. 
DADDY I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him. 
MOTHER You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor. 
DADDY He's a polecat, dear. 
INT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
CUT TO a shot of Daddy, Mother and the Hillyer children in a hospital elevator as a black elevator operator runs them down. Daddy has his hat politely removed and is staring pensively ahead. 
DADDY Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed. (sighs, shakes his head) I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her. 
MOTHER I don't see how you can even think of it now. 
Daddy purses his lips but says nothing. It is obvious the "epizootics" have saved Rose, at least for the time being. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
A SHOT of Rose in bed in her own bedroom. She is propped up on pillows and wearing a rather attractive pink silk housecoat of Mother's. A tray is on her lap and she is eating her supper as Buddy sits on the edge of the bed talking with her, or rather listening to her. It is obvious she is well on the road back to health. 
ROSE Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts! 
BUDDY Rose, you are too uncritical of people. 
ROSE You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat. 
BUDDY He did? 
ROSE Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, "You know, you are beautiful." Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more? 
BUDDY Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy. 
ROSE He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him? 
BUDDY Yeah, I'd believe it. 
ROSE Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared. 
BUDDY Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people. 
ROSE I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas. 
INT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT 
CUT TO a shot of Mother opening the front door. Dr. Martinson is there-with his black bag, an icy polite look on his face.; 
MOTHER Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now. 
DR. MARTINSON Let me be the judge of that, Madam. 
MOTHER Yes. Well. She's upstairs. 
INT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY/NIGHT

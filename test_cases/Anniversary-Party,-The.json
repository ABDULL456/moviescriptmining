{"test1_input": "SOPHIA Evie has a little something for you. \nEvie shakes her head. \nSOPHIA (CONT'D) You do. \nEVIE (even) I don't think so. \nSALLY Since when are you so shy? \nEVIE (her mother's daughter) Never. \nSOPHIA (bright smile) Honey, we have gifts for you and all sorts of surprises.  Where is America?  I know she's here somewhere. \nJoe reaches for the gifts. \nJOE I'll take them. \nSOPHIA No, I have a little talking to do with America.  Privately.  I'll find her. \nSALLY (to Sophia) In the kitchen. \nJOE Who'd like to go and find Otis? \nEVIE Me! \nJACK I guess. \nJUDY The infamous dog? \nJOE He's the best dog in the world. (to Judy) They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea. \nJUDY Ours. \nJOE It's Jerry's worst idea. \nCAL What's that? \nJOE The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I? (to Sally) Wouldn't I? \nSALLY (small smile) Yes. \nJOE (to the kids) Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum. \nJoe goes off with the children to find Otis.  Cal sits at the piano, plays. \nINT. FOYER - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS \nJoe holds Evie in one arm.  Jack stands beside him, holds his hand.  MONICA and RYAN ROSE face him across the threshold -- the NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS.  She's in her late twenties - and beautiful, eyes everywhere - star struck and house struck. Ryan is somewhat older, a little awkward in company, swallowing resentment and a little self righteous. \nJOE Well, hello you two. (putting Evie down; to Jack) These are the people who live next door. Say hello. \nJack does. \nJOE (CONT'D) And close the door, Jack.  Because if we leave it open, Otis will run out and you know what will happen then? \nJACK Uh, uh. \nJOE He'll run next door into their backyard and he'll bark and bark and bark and eat their pitbull for his dinner.  Is it a pitbull? \nRYAN (not amused) No, actually. \nJOE (to Jack) Oh whatever.  We don't want that to happen, do we? \nJACK No? \nRYAN It's a rottweiler, actually. (to Jack) I don't think our rottweiler is in any danger, Jack. \nJOE Well, Jack and I are very relieved. \nRYAN I thought this was a party.  Are we going to talk about the dog thing? \nMONICA Please, Ryan. \nJOE (kisses her cheek and shakes his hand) No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink? \n", "test1_true": "An awkward moment. \nMONICA (checks with Ryan) Something soft. \nJOE Right away.  Are you sure you wouldn't like something soft, Ryan? \nRYAN I'm sure, yes. \nSally has watched some of this from the archway, joins them super-friendly. \nSALLY Hi.  Monica and Ryan? \nMONICA Sally? \nSALLY Yes.  And you've met Joe. \nRYAN Yes. \nSALLY (a deep breath) Well, so glad you decided to come. \nMONICA We could hardly say no. \nSALLY Oh? \nJoe slips the coke into Monica's hand. \nSALLY (CONT'D) (takes the gift) Thank you.  This was so unnecessary.  I hope you've noticed that Otis isn't barking as much.  We keep him in at night. \nRYAN At 4:30 today he barked for a solid fifteen minutes.  I have it on tape. \nSALLY You're keeping a record, are you? \nRYAN It's just very distracting when you're trying to work. \nMONICA Ryan. \nRYAN (to Joe) I'm sure you understand. \nSALLY Well the neighborhood is full of dogs, and it's not always Otis. \nRYAN Well today it was Otis.  And you should keep him away from our yard.  Because Sheila will defend herself. \nMONICA Ryan! \nSALLY (cuts off response from Joe; to Ryan) Are you working on a new book? \nRYAN (caught short; flattered) Well, yes, actually. \nMONICA He always has two or three going... \nSALLY Really?  Joe can't manage more than one at a time.  With huge gaps in between. \nNEW ANGLE \nMAC and CLAIR FORSYTHE wave from the door.  Clair's arms are full of presents.  Mac carries three video cameras under his arm.  He's got Otis by the collar. \nMAC You lose this? \nJOE (re: Otis) Ah there's our snookums now. \nRYAN Yes, well, but I haven't won a Booker either.  Or the Whitebread. \nMAC The gate was open. \nSALLY Well, not yet. (she reacts to Mac) The gate was open? \nJOE It's taken care of. \nMONICA I think Ryan needs a new publisher.  I think he's outgrown him.  They're just not doing their job. \nA silence.  Awkward smiles go all around. \nSALLY Hors d'oeuvres or something? \n", "test1_id": 1287, "test2_input": "INT. MUSIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS \nA small, narrow room.  Not much more than an alcove.  With space for a desk, stereo equipment, and shelves packed with CDs.  The topmost shelf is a line of record albums. \nJoe's picking through the CDs.  Monica wanders in from the living room, toting a glass of champagne... watches him for a moment. \nMONICA Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red. \nJOE You're an interior decorator, right? \nMONICA (nods) Sally did all this herself? \nJOE In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing. \nMONICA (somehow at a loss) Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe. \nJOE Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux. (re: champagne) I see you've moved up from the soft stuff. \nMONICA Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't. \nJOE Uh-huh. \nMONICA I'm a little nervous, so... \nJOE Oh. \nMONICA A little out of my element. \nJOE No you're not. \nMONICA Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction. \nJOE Hm. \nMONICA I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating. \nJOE Very well put. \nMONICA I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort. \nJOE What? \nMONICA But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism... \nJOE (pissed) Elitism? \nMONICA The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly. \nJOE And you know, he really does not. \nMONICA And Ryan works at home. \nJOE And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you. \nHer eyes well with tears. \nJOE (CONT'D) Oh shit.  I'm sorry. \nMONICA Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually. \nJOE Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis. \nMonica starts to laugh. \nMONICA Alright. \nIt appears she's consumed more than one glass of champagne. \nJOE Easy tiger. \nMONICA Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking. \nJOE Scout's honor. \nMONICA (grins) I'll be your best friend. \n", "test2_true": "MONICA (CONT'D) Would you sign it for me. (digs for a pen) I'm sure this is inappropriate. \nJOE We're way past inappropriate. \nMonica giggles, presses back the bubble rising in her chest and moving toward her throat.  Manages not to burp. \nMONICA (as he signs it) I'll treasure this. \nHe moves towards the doorway, Monica at his heals. \nJOE I need to leave you now. \nMONICA I will treasure this. \nJOE (shouting down the hall) Sally!!!! \nINT. DAILIES ROOM - LATER - DAY \nSally's team prepares clues for charades.  Sally writes them down, throws them in a bowler hat.  Her teammates are Panes, Sophia, Mac, Ryan, Sanford and Jeffrey. \nSALLY Panes? \nPANES From Jewish Folk Poetry, a song cycle... \nMAC What? \nSALLY Trust him. \nPANES It's Shostakovich. \nRyan spots his book on the shelf and pulls it out, delighted. \nSALLY Sandy... \nSANFORD The Wind Up Bird Chronicle. \nSALLY (turns to him) Ryan? \nRYAN (pleased) I didn't know you had this. \nSALLY Oh.  Well, yes.  It's extraordinary.  You think you could sign it for us? \nRYAN Absolutely.  You always wonder where your books end up.  Why don't we use it? \nJUDY Good idea. \nRYAN There's not a chance in hell anyone will get it... \nMAC Down by Law. \nSOPHIA Who's not going to get that in fifteen seconds. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJoe's team works on it's clues.  Teammates: Gina, Cal, Clair, Skye, Monica, Jerry and Mary-Lynn.  Everyone is talking over each other and fighting for attention.  There are a lot of strong personalities here. \nJOE Can we... one at a time?  Hold it down, and one at a time.  You're last, Cal. \nCAL Why last? \nMONICA The Katzenjammer Kids. \nThere's a hush. \nMONICA (CONT'D) You know.  It's the Funnies.  The Katzenjammer Kids.  It's my mother's favorite charade's clue.  No one ever gets it. \nPause. \nJOE Alright.  Good.  Fine, I vote for that. \nHe writes it down. \nMONICA With a \"Z.\"  K. A. T. Z. \n", "test2_id": 1288, "test3_input": "SALLY (laughs) Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids. \nSOPHIA He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material. \nSALLY Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin. \nSally drops out of frame. \nSOPHIA Don't try and change the subject. (sitting, joining Sally) Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable. \nSALLY And Cal's this massive adult? \nSOPHIA Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight? \nSALLY You weren't exactly horrified. \nSOPHIA (laughing) I don't have a drug problem. \nSALLY Neither does Joe. \nSOPHIA His sister does.  Big time.  And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article. \nSally stares at her friend suddenly mute, eyes wide. \nSOPHIA (CONT'D) You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back. \nSALLY (getting up) We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London. \nSOPHIA (following her) Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut. \nSALLY Not nice.  Not kind. \nSOPHIA Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel. \nSALLY Why are you doing this? \nSOPHIA His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic. \nSALLY (tearing up) But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic. \nSOPHIA (also tearing up) No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  \"Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director...\" English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway. \nThey hug a bit weepy. \nSOPHIA (CONT'D) He's always one step removed, always looking over his shoulder always looking for something else, something more intoxicating, and I don't mean drugs.  I love him, Sal, but he's a child.  He's not ready. (a choked sob, tears well and fall) Oh God, you're so lucky you don't have kids.  You can't stick your head in the oven.  You can't take a handful of Percoden if you want to, or slit your wrists.  You can't do yourself in.  Kids rob you of that option.  Trust me. (a beat) Oh my God, this ecstacy must be really good. \nEXT. POOL SIDE - CONTINUOUS \nJoe and Cal sit by the edge of the pool watching Skye dance by herself at the far end.  Joe has his hand on Cal's chest. Cal is stroking Joe's hair. \nJOE Isn't Skye amazing? \nCAL She's got great tits. \nJOE She's a constant surprise. \nCAL And you've only just met. \nJOE Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and... (taps his head) The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice? \nCAL Absolutely.  And she's got great tits. \nJOE Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her. \nCAL The camera loves her.  A great actress. \nJOE With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them. \nHe gets up to go towards Skye, is stopped by... \nEXT. MEDIUM SHOT - CLAIR \nClair is climbing up the pool steps. \nCLAIR Has anyone seen Mac? \n", "test3_true": "CLAIR I'm so good. \nShe kisses Joe and Cal, and goes off to find her husband. \nCAL Poor Mac.  It's been a bit of a struggle. I'm sure Sally's told you. \nJOE No, what? \nCAL The movie. \nJOE Oh, she's really enjoying it.  I think. Is Mac okay? \nCAL I don't know what's going on.  I don't care to guess.  Mac's really unhappy. She isn't there, that's all.  She's no idea what she's playing, not a clue. \nJOE Who, Sally? \nCAL And, you know it isn't rocket science, this script.  She can barely get the lines out.  There was a scene last week - she sobbed, through every take.  I know crying's easy for her but it's a fucking comedy, Joe.  Something's gone.  You know, that thing that was Sally - that always surprised you.  It's gone.  I think she's scared.  And that's death. \nJOE I still think she sails above the rest. I mean not like her early films.  But those were all such great directors. \nCAL Mac's a pretty great director, Joe.  He's a woman's director.  And nothing's happening.  Course he won't fire her, because of the friendship... But it was discussed.  He had to battle his studio to get her in the first place. \nJOE What? \nCAL Hey, listen, I love her.  She's Sophia's best friend. (to Joe's stare) I never said any of this, alright.  I'll deny it on the stand... (into the silence) You guys are gonna have kids.  That is so great.  Maybe that's what this is all about.  Maybe she doesn't want to do this anymore.  You know adults don't do this for a living.  You guys are gonna have your kids, you'll be directing -- one asshole in the family is enough.  Sophia knew that intuitively.  Look at Clair. Clair's a mess. (throws an arm around him) Make sure she gets the epidural.  Forget that natural childbirth shit. Everything's going to be what it's supposed to be.  \"Life is but a walking shadow.  A poor player who struts and frets his hour upon the stage and then is heard no more...\" And speaking of me, the role of Leo in your film? \nJOE (stares at him) Leo? \nCAL Any thoughts on casting yet? \nJOE (regards him) Leo?  It was out to Jude Law.  Jude passed. \nCAL Well, I can't make any promises, and of course I haven't read the script but I loved the novel...when are you shooting? \nJOE October-ish. \nCAL I have a small window of time. \nJOE Leo.  Leo's twenty-eight, Cal. \nCAL Scratch the two, write in a four. \nJOE Scratch the two, write in a four. \nCAL You've got a lot of fucking gall.  Thirty nine. \nJOE Five years ago, I was at the party, remember? \nJoe looks up and sees Sally standing in the sun room.  He blows her a kiss.  She kisses her finger tips and puts her hand flat against the window pane. \nINT. BEDROOM CLOSET - TIGHT CLOSE - SALLY \nShe's in her wardrobe pacing back and forth a bit frantic. Trying on clothing, tossing garments to the ground.  The floor is a heap of discarded ideas.  She pulls on jeans and a t-shirt.  Very similar to what Skye is wearing.  She sits a moment on the floor.  The sounds of the party below are muted. \nSALLY (O.S.) Oh Warren, that was awful, I can't sing. \nThe CAMERA stays with Sally as she gets to her feet, walks along the corridor, toward the sound of her voice. \nINT. DAILIES ROOM - NIGHT \nMac is on the edge of the couch, elbows on knees, staring at the television screen - watching his dailies.  At some point he drops his head.  Stops watching... \nINT. MOVIE SET \nCAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.) You sing like a bird. \nSALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.) A bird with dropsy.  A caged bird.  That hasn't long to live. \nCAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S) You seem so alive up there. \nSally stands at the open door.  Stunned.  Watches Mac watch her.  Watches herself, with a professional, acute eye.  More critical than Mac's could ever be. \nSALLY (ON TV) I was faking it.  I've been feeling caged for sometime.  Funny, huh? \n", "test3_id": 1289}

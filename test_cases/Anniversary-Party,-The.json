{"train": "\"THE ANNIVERSARY PARTY\" -- by Alan Cumming & Jennifer Jason Leigh \nFADE IN: \nTIGHT CLOSE - JOE THERRIAN - MORNING \nHe's in his mid-thirties, his face relaxed in sleep, childlike.  Nestled soundly a tangle in the arms of his wife. \nTHE CAMERA STAYS CLOSE.  SLIGHTLY BLURRED, SOFT, SLOWLY SWINGS ROUND \nTIGHT CLOSE - SALLY THERRIAN \nShe's in her mid-thirties, with large deep eyes.  She watches her husband unguarded in sleep.  Her pretty face, alert, she's barely breathing.  Traces the just visible lines around his eyes, and mouth.  Brushes fingertips against his eyelashes. \nTIGHT CLOSE - SALLY'S HAND PULLS THE BEDROOM SHADE. \nIt retracts with a loud WHACK, sun, sky, trees. \nSTEVEN (O.S.) And breath...and chataronga... \nEXT. POOL AREA - DAY \nWe're in the middle of a yoga lesson.  Joe and Sally stand on their mats.  Steven, their instructor, wanders around the couple issuing soft-spoken instructions. \nA large room with hard wood floors, dominated by a huge fireplace.  The dining room on one side, living room on the other.  Floor to ceiling windows overlook the back porch garden pool... The house is classic Neutra.  All GLASS and SMOOTH LINES. \nThe calm is broken by the telephone.  Joe and Sally ignore it until the answering machine picks up.  They break their yoga poses and listen. \nThe CAMERA hovers over the answering machine. \nLUCY (O.S.) (over answering machine; sweet, British, slightly desperate) Joe, it's Lucy.  Remember me?  It's the black sheep here.  Bah...not funny. Haven't heard from you, need you, call me.  Love you madly.  Hi, Sally.  Joe, I'd love to talk to you before I go... \nJOE Go where? \nLUCY (O.S.) (over answering machine) It's a damn nuisance you aren't here, big brother.  Sorry I drone on.  I miss you. I lo-- \nThe machine cuts her off. \nNEW ANGLE \nJoe and Sally have resumed their positions.  This wasn't the call they were waiting for. \nWIDE SHOT \nAMERICA, forty-one, and ROSA, fifty, struggle up the steps of the back porch carrying grocery bags and packages, come through the sliding glass door... \nTHE CAMERA FOLLOWS THEM \nThrough the dining room and into the kitchen, watches the two unpack groceries, flowers, etc., and start to dress the dining room table.  They speak quietly to each other in Spanish. \nJOE America, could you just... \nAmerica closes the sliding doors between the kitchen and the dining room, giving the couple their privacy. \nJOE (CONT'D) (calls out) Thank you, America! \nSTEVEN Okay, let's just take a deep breath, let your ribs expand and relax.  And reach up and into downward dog. \nOtis, the Bisenji/Sheperd mix, sleeping on his leopard pillow, stirs, stretches and groans. \nJOE AND SALLY Good boy, Otis. \nThe phone RINGS again. \nVOICE (O.S.) (over answering machine) Hello, I have Dr. Harmon calling for Sally Therrian. \nSally jumps out of the down dog position and runs to the phone, all angles. \nSALLY Hello, hi, hi...and?  Thank God. \nSally stands with the phone to her ear, her back to Joe. \nEXT. POOL AREA - CONTINUOUS \nJoe watches her from his position, not concentrating on the teacher waiting a sign.  Sally returns to the lesson.  They do their handstands against the wall, on either side of the front door. \nJERRY They're paying him scale. \nThe CAMERA catches sight of Joe behind them.  He moves through the foyer and into the living room with a tray of glasses and Judy in tow. \nSALLY He gets huge advances on his novels. He's going back to that.  You know how he hates it here. \nJERRY There's still time to undo this. \nSALLY (kisses his cheek) We'll be fine. \nJERRY (re: barking dog) Did you invite them? \nSALLY The Roses?  And of course they said yes. \nJERRY That was the plan.  And you're thrilled to have them. \nSALLY Whatever you say. \nJERRY Did you tell Joe to behave? \nSALLY Yes. \nJERRY Did he promise? \nSALLY Scout's honor. \nJERRY Before I forget. (pulls a novel from his briefcase) Put it on the bookshelf. \nShe flips the book -- on the back is a full page picture of RYAN ROSE. \nSALLY You're out of your mind. \nJERRY Just do what I say, alright? \nSALLY How much bowing and scraping do you want us to do? \nJERRY Beats a lawsuit. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJoe and Judy sit on opposite sides of the sofa -- slightly uncomfortable with each other. \nJOE (to fill the silence, conspiratorial grin) I love gifts.  What did you guys get us? \nJUDY (chokes on the champagne) Nothing that can't be exchanged. \nJOE Oh.  Well.  Good. \nJUDY Congratulations on the deal.  How exciting.  Is Sally doing Sally?  I mean it's Sally.  The character that's based on Sally.  The character that's based on Sally in the book. \nJOE The novel.  No, Skye Davidson is playing the lead. \nJUDY Oh my God, I'm a huge Skye Davidson fan. She's very beautiful. \nJOE Yes, she is. \nJUDY (trying harder) But I am right, yes?  She's based on Sally. \nJOE It's a novel. \nJUDY Still.  Well.  Let's drop it. \nJOE Yes. \nJUDY I'm not much of a reader, but I do love autobiographies, even biographies sometimes.  Mostly non-fiction.  Did you read the new Styron? \nJOE No. \nJUDY It's very good. (a moment) I understand you won the Booker Prize. \nJOE Yes I did. \nJUDY (another moment) Is your script much like the novel? Jerry says it's very good.  But you know, you read the novel, and then you see the movie - and most of the time you say, \"what's this?\" You know?  I sometimes think we're better off not reading the novel at all.  Because, we come with expectations... and of course, we know where we're going.  Don't you find? \nJOE Don't I find what? \nSOPHIA Evie has a little something for you. \nEvie shakes her head. \nSOPHIA (CONT'D) You do. \nEVIE (even) I don't think so. \nSALLY Since when are you so shy? \nEVIE (her mother's daughter) Never. \nSOPHIA (bright smile) Honey, we have gifts for you and all sorts of surprises.  Where is America?  I know she's here somewhere. \nJoe reaches for the gifts. \nJOE I'll take them. \nSOPHIA No, I have a little talking to do with America.  Privately.  I'll find her. \nSALLY (to Sophia) In the kitchen. \nJOE Who'd like to go and find Otis? \nEVIE Me! \nJACK I guess. \nJUDY The infamous dog? \nJOE He's the best dog in the world. (to Judy) They're both coming tonight.  Not my idea. \nJUDY Ours. \nJOE It's Jerry's worst idea. \nCAL What's that? \nJOE The neighbors from hell.  The kind that lay in wait.  I'd rather move actually. Wouldn't I? (to Sally) Wouldn't I? \nSALLY (small smile) Yes. \nJOE (to the kids) Okay.  Last one to find Otis is a smelly old bum. \nJoe goes off with the children to find Otis.  Cal sits at the piano, plays. \nINT. FOYER - FRONT DOOR - CONTINUOUS \nJoe holds Evie in one arm.  Jack stands beside him, holds his hand.  MONICA and RYAN ROSE face him across the threshold -- the NEXT DOOR NEIGHBORS.  She's in her late twenties - and beautiful, eyes everywhere - star struck and house struck. Ryan is somewhat older, a little awkward in company, swallowing resentment and a little self righteous. \nJOE Well, hello you two. (putting Evie down; to Jack) These are the people who live next door. Say hello. \nJack does. \nJOE (CONT'D) And close the door, Jack.  Because if we leave it open, Otis will run out and you know what will happen then? \nJACK Uh, uh. \nJOE He'll run next door into their backyard and he'll bark and bark and bark and eat their pitbull for his dinner.  Is it a pitbull? \nRYAN (not amused) No, actually. \nJOE (to Jack) Oh whatever.  We don't want that to happen, do we? \nJACK No? \nRYAN It's a rottweiler, actually. (to Jack) I don't think our rottweiler is in any danger, Jack. \nJOE Well, Jack and I are very relieved. \nRYAN I thought this was a party.  Are we going to talk about the dog thing? \nMONICA Please, Ryan. \nJOE (kisses her cheek and shakes his hand) No, he's absolutely right.  You're absolutely right, Ryan.  Dog talk must be banned.  Canine conversations are completely discouraged... it's really good of you to join us.  Can I get you a drink? \nMONICA Yes, great!  It's a beautiful house. \nSALLY Thank you.  I understand you're an interior decorator. \nMONICA Yes. \nSALLY I so wish I'd known. \nMONICA Well, whoever did this is amazing. \nSALLY I did it. \nJOE (comes on them with the Forsythes in tow) She rarely cops to it. (kisses Sally's cheek) Otis is home. \nCLAIR (re: the gifts) Where can I put these? \nSally takes the gifts from her. \nCLAIR (CONT'D) What a fucking day!  We only just got a sitter.  I don't know her from fucking Adam.  She could be a serial killer.  I'm going to have to call every ten minutes. You have to let me give out the number. \nSALLY Of course. \nMAC She already has. \nCLAIR It's alright, isn't it? \nSALLY Of course it's alright. \nMAC Clair is a hovering mother. \nCLAIR I'm not. \nSALLY This is Monica and Ryan.  Mac and Clair. \nClair takes a glass of champagne off the tray as they make their way down the hall. \nCLAIR (a wide professionally ingratiating smile) So nice... \nMONICA And for us... Truly. \nCLAIR Well... \nMONICA You will never know. \nCLAIR (pleased) Oh. (to Sally) I have a four-thirty call.  AM.  So we may have to leave early. \nSALLY Why didn't you bring him? \nCLAIR What? \nSALLY Why didn't you bring him? \nCLAIR (searches) He's allergic. \nSALLY Oh. \nCLAIR To dander.  Otis. \nSALLY Oh. \nCLAIR Didn't I say? \nSALLY Well, probably. \nCLAIR They can tell from the eyelashes, you know?  He's got eyelashes yay long.  They must be a foot long.  The older you are when you have a baby, the more likely this stuff is to crop up. \nSALLY (muted) Oh. \nThe Roses are happy to stand there on the fringe.  Next to someone they've only seen on screen and magazine covers. \nClair's not in the least put off by them.  She manages to smile at them inclusively from time to time. \nCLAIR So they tell me.  Not soon enough, of course. (kisses her cheek) How are you, Sal?  You look fantastic. It changes your life, you know.  A baby. It puts everything in perspective, doesn't it.  Doesn't it, Mac?  You can't be the center of your own world, anymore. \nMAC (as grounded as Clair isn't) It's an object lesson in grace. (on seeing Cal Gold on the back porch) Wow!  Look who's here before me!  My leading man is on time for once. \nSOPHIA (to Monica) Would you like to meet my husband? \nIt's all Monica can do to keep from putting her hand to her chest. \nMONICA I'd be thrilled. \nSOPHIA Then he'll be thrilled. \nShe ushers them toward the living room. \nJOE (re: Sophia, appreciative) She's such pure evil. \nSally approaches, gives Gina a warm kiss on the chest. \nSALLY Thanks for coming. \nGINA Happy anniversary.  You're a good match, you two. (to Joe) Can you help me with this stuff? \nJOE (re: one of her bags) That for us? \nGINA What a nose.  You missed your calling. \nJOE Can I open it? \nGINA (defers) Sally? \nJOE Please? \nSALLY He's impossible.  Go on then. \nJoe rips open the gift.  It's a framed black and white of Joe, Sally and Otis lying on the couch.  It's clear which photos in the house are Gina's.  It's a breathtaking print, an amazing caught moment.  All light and shadow.  A touching study. \nSALLY (CONT'D) (respectful of the talent) It's beautiful, thank you so much. \nJoe, moved somehow, hugs Gina to him.  Kisses her. \nJOE I love you,  Gina Taylor. \nSally's uncomfortable, a little jealous... feels intrusive. Aware that Gina got there first.  Knew him when.  And always captures something naked and vulnerable in his face. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GUEST ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nIn the center of the room a low table with paints and crayons and glue and baubles.  Two child size chairs either side. Empty, the table hasn't been touched. \nEvie stands against the far wall.  She wears a helmet and is surrounded by toy suction arrows.  The arrows make a perfect outline of her head and body.  Jack stands three feet away, bow in hand -- the archer prepares his next shot. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nCal is at the piano, charming the neighbors.  Judy chats with Mac.  Jerry is on his cellphone, holding his Palm Pilot, his hand pressed against his ear to block out the chatter.  Sally joins Cal on the piano stool.  Sophia moves to Clair on the couch, kisses her cheek. \nSOPHIA You look so well, Clair.  A wraith. \nCLAIR (pleased) You think so!?  I've been working out a lot since the baby. And I've been working.  And that takes it's toll, you know. \nSOPHIA I'm glad that's all over for me. \nCLAIR Don't you miss it? \nSOPHIA Never. \nCLAIR Really. \nSOPHIA Not for a second.  Cal can have all that. \nCLAIR Really? \nSOPHIA So where is young Jonah? \nCLAIR With a sitter.  We have a sensational sitter.  Jonah's really comfortable with her.  You know, a second mom sort of. Like part of the family.  Amazing with kids. \nShe inadvertently touches the beeper on her belt, and it beeps.  She jumps. \nSOPHIA What is that thing? \nPANES Not enough. \nSally takes Panes into the living room where everyone chats, drinks, smokes.  They all like each other out of habit, if nothing else.  Ryan and Monica are on the fringe, stand at the edges of conversation.  There's always someone at the piano, and they can all pretty much play. \nSALLY Panes is here! \nPANES (gives everyone a shy, pained little wave) Oh great. \nEveryone stops, turns, toasts. \nEVERYONE Panes! \nMONICA/RYAN (a little late; into silence) Panes. \nPanes gives them another little wave.  Doorbell rings. \nTIGHT CLOSE - SKYE DAVIDSON \nSKYE Hi. \nShe's the young, beautiful actress who'll play the lead in Joe's film. \nJOE (his face lights up) Skye! \nShe's in jeans, but somehow looks dressed to the 9s. \nSKYE You're Joe, aren't you? (nods knowingly) I recognized you from the book jacket. \nJoe grins from ear to ear.  Uncharacteristically star struck in front of this beauty. \nJOE How do you do, Skye? \nSKYE Oh, I love that. (throws arms around him) I'm just great.  I'm so happy to be here. And I apologize for invading you.  And I'm so happy you asked me to.  I'm so touched.  I know how private you and Sally are. \nJOE (uncomfortable) Yeah, well, it's just us and a few hundred of our closest friends. \nSKYE (genuine) When I read your work I felt that you knew me.  Women must tell you that.  And this one in particular speaks to me, do you know?  I am Genna.  How many women must tell you that.  And the script is wonderful.  Wonderful and lean and visual... \nJOE I'm so happy you like it.  I'm so relieved you said yes, and I'm really, um, what, thrilled, yes actually, to finally meet you. \nSKYE You're going to be a remarkable director, a brilliant director. \nThere's a long moment. \nJOE (finally) I think you're my first Goddess. \nSally and Panes have been watching from the living room. \nPANES She's even better looking in the flesh. \nSALLY Really?  I need a drink.  Come hide with me. \nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \nAmerica and Rosa are working at the counter, Panes and Sally come through. \nSALLY Oh, Jesus, Panes.  I can't, I can't believe that bitch is in my house. \nPANES You don't know she's a bitch. \nSALLY She's all over him, are you blind? \nPANES It could be worse. \nSALLY How? \nPANES She could be playing the role in Joe's movie that should be yours. \nSALLY Fuck you, Panes. \nPANES You see, that's worse. \nSALLY I just wanted tonight to be with the people we love. \nPANES Like your business managers? \nINT. MUSIC LIBRARY - CONTINUOUS \nA small, narrow room.  Not much more than an alcove.  With space for a desk, stereo equipment, and shelves packed with CDs.  The topmost shelf is a line of record albums. \nJoe's picking through the CDs.  Monica wanders in from the living room, toting a glass of champagne... watches him for a moment. \nMONICA Your Eames table is incredible.  And the B&B.  I just put that in a client's home, actually, but in red. \nJOE You're an interior decorator, right? \nMONICA (nods) Sally did all this herself? \nJOE In fits and starts -- and then, later, of course, she had to accommodate me.  So things shifted a little bit then, became more eclectic.  And it keeps changing. \nMONICA (somehow at a loss) Mmm.  It says something about the two of you maybe. \nJOE Yeah, we're in a constant state of flux. (re: champagne) I see you've moved up from the soft stuff. \nMONICA Oh, yes.  You know Ryan's been sober eight years.  And it's difficult if I... you know.  It's better if I don't. \nJOE Uh-huh. \nMONICA I'm a little nervous, so... \nJOE Oh. \nMONICA A little out of my element. \nJOE No you're not. \nMONICA Well, yes.  Yes, in fact.  A little on the outside, yes.  And there's been all this friction. \nJOE Hm. \nMONICA I don't know why, but these misunderstandings have a way of escalating. \nJOE Very well put. \nMONICA I think a lot of this could have been avoided if Sally made more of an effort. \nJOE What? \nMONICA But you're very private people.  You know, there's a kind of elitism... \nJOE (pissed) Elitism? \nMONICA The wrong word, maybe.  Delete that. And, you know, the dog barks incessantly. \nJOE And you know, he really does not. \nMONICA And Ryan works at home. \nJOE And your phone calls are nasty and abusive.  And I've come this close to suing you for harassment.  And you're only here because we're supposed to be sucking up to you. \nHer eyes well with tears. \nJOE (CONT'D) Oh shit.  I'm sorry. \nMONICA Well, that's what Ryan thought.  I was more generous, actually. \nJOE Oh shit.  I'm sorry.  I'm a total fucking maniac.  Delete all that, okay?  I spoke for myself, this needn't rub off on my wife.  Oh shit.  I get pissy sometimes. Much worse than Otis.  Otis doesn't bite. It's just, I really love my dog and he doesn't really bark a lot. We live in a canyon.  We hear dogs barking at night, too.  And it's not Otis. \nMonica starts to laugh. \nMONICA Alright. \nIt appears she's consumed more than one glass of champagne. \nJOE Easy tiger. \nMONICA Alright.  Please don't tell Ryan I'm drinking. \nJOE Scout's honor. \nMONICA (grins) I'll be your best friend. \nGina loses it, cracks up. \nMAC Time. \nTIME CUT TO: \nJeffrey's on his feet, giving the clue. \nSALLY'S TEAM (unison) Quote.  Play. \nSOPHIA Oh shit.  It's one of Cal's.  Obscure Shakespeare, folks. \nCal gives her a little wave from the other side. \nSOPHIA (CONT'D) (calls over to him) Maybe something original for a change. \nCal blows her a kiss. \nSALLY'S TEAM (in unison) Ten...twenty...thirty...seven, eight. Thirty-eighth word...thirty-seventh word. \nGina's been taking shots through the course of the game, and the FRAME will freeze black and white on one of another delicious moment.  There's a spectacular shot of Sally, unaware, laughing, sad soft eyes on Joe. \nMEDIUM CLOSE - AMERICA \nShe watches the game from the archway, waits for a break. Sky's up.  Joe's team yells frantic guesses.  Jerry's suicidal. \nSally's team watches, self-satisfied, throw barbed asides. \nSALLY (to Joe's look; innocence) I didn't say a word. \nMAC Time! \nJERRY What was it?  What the fuck was it? \nSALLY (small grin) Ryan's novel. \nJERRY Ryan's novel? \nJUDY Ryan's novel, Jerry. \nAMERICA (sings out) Dinner! \nSALLY Still champions. \nJOE Panes is not on your team anymore. \nPANES What did I do? \nSALLY Panes is not on my team anymore.  I'll have Panes if I like. \nAMERICA Dinner. \nSALLY Dinner. \nJOE It's an unfair advantage. \nSALLY You've got Cal.  You've got Gina.  You've got Skye?  We're the leftovers. \nJOE Okay, knock it off. \nSALLY Truce? \nJOE Truce. \nSALLY Dinner. (on the move) Don't be angry. \nJOE (pissed) I'm not fucking angry, for God's sake. \nEXT. POOL AREA - MAGIC HOUR \nEvie and Jake run along the side of the house.  Behind the glass walls the CAMERA catches adults moving through the living room and into the dining room. \nINT. DINING ROOM - MAGIC HOUR \nMost everyone's moved through to the dining room.  The table is filled with platters of beautifully prepared food. Candles, flowers. \nGINA Escape hatch. \nJOE (eyes her) Escape hatch.  And Dad was having a go about the garden.  Something was misplanted... \nSALLY Not properly watered. \nJOE Whatever! (to Gina) You know how he gets.  Well, he went absolutely bonkers.  Lucy and I were frantically trying to scramble into the dumb waiter and I didn't fit any more. It was almost fatal.  And that, my dear friends, is the day... \nSALLY/JEFFREY I realized I had become a man.  Ta da! \nGINA You're not a man, Joe.  You're a boy. \nJOE (childishly) So? \nGINA (laughs) I love you, Joe Therrian. \nSALLY (at a loss, small) Me too. \nSophia watches from across the living room. \nNEW ANGLE \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nAstrid squeezes in next to Sally, on her second portion of everything.  She allows Anouk to nibble from her plate. \nASTRID You're not upset that I brought the dog? \nSALLY Would it make a difference? \nASTRID Anouk isn't like a dog, really.  More like a small person.  So is there anyone here for me?  No one looks new. (fixes on Ryan) Who's that? \nSALLY You don't want that.  It's married and it's the neighbor. \nASTRID Oh I think he's cute.  How's the marriage part working out? \nSALLY You're fucking desperate. \nASTRID Like you didn't know. (re: Skye) Who invited the bimbo? \nSALLY One guess. \nINT. LIVING ROOM \nThe CAMERA stays close on the cake as America wheels the cart into the living room.  The top of it sports Sally and Joe's faces on either side of Otis, a detailed edible photograph. There are three sixes across the top. \nThere's a freed up pathway.  Cal taps the side of his champagne glass with a fork. \nSOPHIA (re: the cake as it comes in) Part of our gift.  Honey!! \nCAL (clinks his glass) Here, here. \nClair picks up discarded dinner plates.  Otis takes care of those behind couches, under tables. \nThe gifts are stacked high, near the fireplace.  Sally is on the floor, nestled between Joe's knees, leaning back against him.  His arms are wrapped around her, face pressed against hers. \nThere's a SERIES OF CUTS through speeches, gifts, entertainment.  Sophia and Cal do a well rehearsed, very funny, impromptu something with their kids. \nPanes and Mac do an interpretive dance symbolizing the marriage. \nCal and Sophia carry sleeping children down the hall. \nThere are speeches about Sally and Joe, outrageously dirty, funny, sometimes touching - that cover their recent separation, the custody of Otis, their trying to have a baby... \nPanes plays a piece on the violin.  Someone else sings.  And finally... \nMEDIUM CLOSE - SKYE \nShe looks out at the guests... \nNEW ANGLE \nThey look back at her. \nSKYE I wasn't prepared to say anything.  I'm honored to be a part of tonight.  To be in the same room, with my favorite living actress... \nMONICA I love it here.  Don't you love it here, Ryan?  I love it here.  And I love tonight.  And I love these people.  And this feels utterly fantastic, Ryan. (touches her own cheek, ever so lightly; shivers against the sensation) Utterly fantastic. \nRYAN You know what Sally Therrian was saying about your spine and your brain?  She didn't pull that out of thin air.  It causes brain damage.  You'd better drink a lot of water. \nMONICA Do you want to go home, Ryan? \nRYAN Yes. \nMONICA I think you should then.  You should look in on Sheila. \nRYAN I'm not going to leave you alone. \nMONICA They're really nice people, Ryan. They're like us... \nRYAN They're nothing like us. \nMONICA I think you need to speak for yourself, Ryan.  But I think you're really nice people... \nShe puts arms around him, kisses his cheek.  He stiffens. \nRYAN Are you making an ass of yourself? \nMONICA There's only you, Ryan.  You know what, Ryan?  You're beautiful.  I love you so much... You need... \nRYAN I don't need a drug. \nMONICA You need a good review and you'll be fine.  The whole color of the world will change, mark my words. \nShe gets up. \nRYAN Ready to go? \nMONICA I'm going to go get my swimsuit.  I do know, Ryan, this is non addictive so you mustn't worry. (turns back) Ryan, you're a great man. \nThe CAMERA follows Monica along the side of the pool.  She passes Sophia and a very exuberant Clair. \nThe CAMERA stays at the pool.  Clair tears off Sally's Galiano, flings it to the ground and dives topless into the pool. \nCLAIR This water is great! \nJERRY (swimming past her) Wanna dive for a baton? \nMEDIUM CLOSE UP - JUDY \nShe stands at the side of the pool. \nJUDY Okay, I'm about to throw five colored batons in the water.  Then I'm going to count to three, and then you may start diving.  I'm playing too.  The red one is ten extra points.  Ready? (she throws batons in) One, two, three, go!! \nThere is a melee of diving and screaming. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BACKYARD LANDING \nIt's at the end of a bridge, overlooking the pool.  Voices drift up from below.  Mac and Joe walk in circles pacing around one another. \nMAC You got your DP? \nJOE What?  Oh yeah, the camera man?  They gave me a list. \nMAC And you got Skye Davidson.  Pretty big leagues for a first timer.  Do you even like movies? \nJOE Not particularly.  Weird, isn't it?  God I'm rally up.  Do you feel anything yet, Mac? \nMAC Kind of.  Hey, look - John Seale, Oliver Stapelton, Darius Khonji - they're friends.  And great DP's I could give them a call for you. \nJOE Thanks, Mac. (regards him) And thanks for being so supportive about all this. (throws arm around him, hugs him close) I really love you, you know. \nMAC Hey, I'm happy for you, buddy.  Anything I can do. \nJOE (lets go of Mac) God, I really need to jump about a bit. (begins jumping) How's your film going? \nCAL It's going.  It's going. \nJOE And how's the diva doing? \nSALLY (laughs) Oh Soph, Joe loves kids.  Joe wants kids. Joe thinks he needs kids. \nSOPHIA He wants playmates.  Oh he's a sweetheart, Sal, you know I love him. But he's not going to be a good father. He's just not parenting material. \nSALLY Hey, let's sit down.  I bet the rug feels really nice against your skin. \nSally drops out of frame. \nSOPHIA Don't try and change the subject. (sitting, joining Sally) Oh God, it feels great!  He's just a little narcissistic, irresponsible and unreliable. \nSALLY And Cal's this massive adult? \nSOPHIA Cal knows who he is.  Did you notice how happy Joe was when the drugs came out tonight? \nSALLY You weren't exactly horrified. \nSOPHIA (laughing) I don't have a drug problem. \nSALLY Neither does Joe. \nSOPHIA His sister does.  Big time.  And the New York Times says addiction is genetic -- I'll e-mail you the article. \nSally stares at her friend suddenly mute, eyes wide. \nSOPHIA (CONT'D) You don't have kids to keep a marriage together, Sally.  It's only five months since Joe came back. \nSALLY (getting up) We're fine.  We're great.  We're having a baby and we're moving to London. \nSOPHIA (following her) Well, you weren't fine last summer when you went Sylvia Plath on me in Connecticut. \nSALLY Not nice.  Not kind. \nSOPHIA Ha!  Not half so not kind as your husband was in his portrayal of you in his novel. \nSALLY Why are you doing this? \nSOPHIA His image of you is a possessive, fragile neurotic. \nSALLY (tearing up) But I am a possessive, fragile neurotic. \nSOPHIA (also tearing up) No you are not.  You're Sally Nash. Listen to me, you're Sally Nash.  You're my best friend and I love you more than anyone, and you're not going to move to London to have the offspring of a sexually ambivalent man-child.  \"Oh now I'm a novelist, oh now I'm a director...\" English prick bastard Joe Therrian who's probably going to leave you for Skye Davidson anyway. \nThey hug a bit weepy. \nSOPHIA (CONT'D) He's always one step removed, always looking over his shoulder always looking for something else, something more intoxicating, and I don't mean drugs.  I love him, Sal, but he's a child.  He's not ready. (a choked sob, tears well and fall) Oh God, you're so lucky you don't have kids.  You can't stick your head in the oven.  You can't take a handful of Percoden if you want to, or slit your wrists.  You can't do yourself in.  Kids rob you of that option.  Trust me. (a beat) Oh my God, this ecstacy must be really good. \nEXT. POOL SIDE - CONTINUOUS \nJoe and Cal sit by the edge of the pool watching Skye dance by herself at the far end.  Joe has his hand on Cal's chest. Cal is stroking Joe's hair. \nJOE Isn't Skye amazing? \nCAL She's got great tits. \nJOE She's a constant surprise. \nCAL And you've only just met. \nJOE Yeah, I know... But she's only twenty seven and... (taps his head) The wisdom.  She's an old soul.  She knew that Shostakovich thing.  Did you notice? \nCAL Absolutely.  And she's got great tits. \nJOE Yeah, God she really does have great tits, great tits.  i can't wait to work with her. \nCAL The camera loves her.  A great actress. \nJOE With great tits.  I'm going to ask her if I can touch them. \nHe gets up to go towards Skye, is stopped by... \nEXT. MEDIUM SHOT - CLAIR \nClair is climbing up the pool steps. \nCLAIR Has anyone seen Mac? \nMAC (moans) No, it's not... Fuck fuck fuck fuck. \nINT. CORRIDOR - CLOSE SHOT - SALLY \nShe backs up into the corridor mortified.  Leans against the wall. \nCAL'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. (O.S.) It's preposterous.  You're free to do whatever you like. \nSALLY'S VOICE FROM THE T.V. Yes, well, we'll see won't we? \nMAC (O.S.) Jesus Christ. \nSALLY (a deep breath) Well...wow... \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nClair's started down the hallway, reaches the landing.  Sally rushes into the guest bedroom to avoid her.  Clair, just missing Sally, wanders into the dailies room. \nINT. DAILIES ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCLAIR Mac?  Oh there you are.  What are you doing, honey?  No more work.  Don't you feel breezy. \nMAC I'm in mourning. \nCLAIR You can cut around it, whatever it is. You always do. \nMAC Not this time. \nCLAIR It's always not this time.  If you can do it around me, you can do it around anyone. \nShe walks in front of the television set, blocks it with her body, switches it off. \nMAC (an observation) You don't have any clothes on. \nCLAIR How nice for everybody.  Come swimming. The water's glorious. (re: the film) You'll fix it.  You'll come up with one of your brilliant ideas. \nMAC Or I won't.  I can't help her.  I'm out of my depth. \nCLAIR Things always look much worse in the morning. \nMAC I don't know how to make her funny. \nCLAIR You're coming swimming in the pool, and in a few minutes you won't even remember what it's about.  You won't care who's in your damn movie. \nMAC (really stoned) What what's about? \nCLAIR I...wait, what are you talking about? \nINT. GUEST ROOM \nMEDIUM CLOSE \nJack and Evie are asleep across the bed. \nNEW ANGLE \nSally sits at the edge of the bed, regards the sleeping children.  Reaches over and smoothens the tangled, tousled hair.  Studies their faces. \nEXT. POOLSIDE - JOE'S POV \nMonica sits on the steps of the pool.  She looks frightened, uncomfortable. \nJOE Are you okay? \nMONICA I don't think so.  I feel.  I feel a bit funny. \nJOE Let's go for a walk. \nHe puts his arm around her and leads her away from the pool. \nEXT. BACKYARD LANDING - NIGHT \nMONICA I've never done this before. \nJOE Oh?  It's easy.  You just put one foot in front of the other... That's a good girl. \nJOE Oh for fuck's sake.  Nobody uses that gate. \nMONICA (horrified) I'm sorry. \nSALLY (raging) There's a goddamn sign on the gate. \nMONICA I'm so sorry. \nSALLY You fucking cow, can't you read?! \nMONICA (at a loss) I... \nSALLY How long ago was it? \nJOE Stop being such a bitch, Sal. \nMONICA I'm so sorry. \nJOE It was a mistake.  This isn't a plot to do in Otis. \nSALLY Don't be so sure. \nJOE Listen to yourself... (to Monica) Don't worry, it's alright.  We'll find him. (to Sally) What's wrong with you? \nSALLY (re: Monica) She left the fucking gate open. \nJOE Well he can't have gone far. \nSALLY Can't have gone far?  He's like a greyhound.  He could be miles away. \nJOE He'll find his way back. \nSALLY There are fucking coyotes out there. \nJOE (calming) Sally, calm down.  We're not going to find him any quicker by you being hysterical. \nMonica retreats, backs off a step or two. \nSALLY Fuck you. \nJOE Or shitty!!  Otis!! \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nAmerica and Rosa are cleaning up.  Ryan hangs around chatting. \nRYAN How long have you worked for the Therrians? \nAMERICA (shrugs, polite but annoyed) A long time. \nRYAN So you were here when they were doing the work on the boundary fence? \nAMERICA Oh yes. \nRYAN Did you know the contractor? \nAMERICA Very well. \nRYAN Was it a contractor? \nAMERICA It's the way they do things. \nRYAN To code? \nHer back is to him.  She exchanges a glance with Rosa, and the Spanish equivalent of \"who is this wanker?\" \nRYAN (CONT'D) Did you see permits?  Did he have a license? \nAMERICA You should talk to Mr. Joe. \nMonica bursts into the room. \nMONICA Ryan, you've got to come!  You've got to help me find the dog!  I let their dog out.  We need to find the dog. \nSALLY Oh fuck you, and fuck Monica while you're at it.  But I guess that's what I interrupted. \nJOE Jesus, Sally.  You are a medical miracle. The only person who's ever taken ecstacy and become angrier. \nSALLY Yeah, let's talk about that.  You seem to be rather an expert.  I don't remember in the last five months of counselling your ever mentioning ecstacy or going to rage parties. \nJOE Rave parties?!  That's so typical - you would think it was called rage.  Perfect! \nSALLY What else don't I know about, Joe?  Let's get really clear here. \nJOE Sally, so I took a few pills.  I went out dancing.  I tried to forget how upset I was about splitting up with you.  I haven't lied to you.  I told you about the people I've slept with.  I just didn't mention the few occasions I took drugs because you're so fucking judgmental I knew I'd never hear the end of it, and you have so little faith and so little trust in me.  Sally, we're back, I love you.  Trust that.  Please let's not do this. \nSALLY Otis!  Come!  Good boy!  Come! \nJOE Otis! \nSALLY I'm not sure we understand that word in the same way. \nJOE Love? \nSALLY You walked out on a five year marriage. \nJOE That hasn't the first fucking thing to do with love.  It's whether we can live together... like this!  All the time. \nSALLY It's not like this all the time. \nJOE DO I want anyone else?  No.  Do I want to be with you for the rest of my natural life?  I'm trying. \nSALLY And how hard it hit? \nJOE Just stop right there, Sally.  We've been through this. \nSALLY You've been through it.  That's how you love people.  When it's easy for you, when it's convenient for you. \nJOE Sally, first of all, you're talking bullshit.  And second... \nSALLY You want to talk about bullshit?  Lucy called you three times this week.  She's a fucking mess, Joe.  Your sister is a fucking mess.  She needs you.  I talk to her more than you do. \nJOE That is not true. \nSALLY It is true.  You know how you love, Joe? You dedicate a book to someone. \nJOE Every novel I've had published in every language I've dedicated to Lucy. \nSALLY Right.  And when was the last time you spoke to her? \nJoe is silent. \nSALLY (CONT'D) And how fucking dare you cast Skye Davidson in that part?  Have you any idea how humiliating that is for me?  I'm an actress!  It's about our marriage for fuck's sake.  Everybody knows that... \nJOE It's a novel. \nSALLY About me! \nJOE Who the fuck do you think you are?  The part of Genna is not just about you. It's about every woman I've ever loved in my entire life.  Including my mother. The character is also clearly in her early twenties, Sally. \nSALLY What are you saying? \nJOE Hello?  Last birthday was? \nSALLY I don't look my age, Joe. \nJOE Sally, I have never considered you for this part because you are too old to play it.  And you are out of touch with reality if you think differently. \nSALLY It's a shit novel anyway. \nJOE Well there you go.  I let you off the hook.  You're one goddamn lucky actress. \nSALLY Not really.  I mean your books have always been pop, but this is the shallowest of the bunch.  That's what all our friends think, anyway. \nJOE Okay.  If we could've, by some miracle, stripped ten years off your face, still couldn't have got the thing made. Because I don't mean anything as a director, and your name doesn't mean fuck all anymore.  And the people that can hire you are afraid to, because they think you're phoning it in.  That you don't have... Oh Christ, Sally. \nSALLY Who?  Who?  Who thinks that? \nJOE Your director and your co-star of your current movie.  Don't dish if you can't take it, Sally. \nEXT. POOL - CONTINUOUS \nJerry pulls Mac to the surface.  Clair and Judy are out of the pool.  Jerry drags the limp body from the pool, pumps Mac's chest - it's clear he knows what he's doing.  Mac coughs up a load of water. \nCLAIR Oh my God.  Honey??? \nThere's a moment.  Mac begins to sob. \nJERRY He's okay, Clair.  You wanna give him a little room? \nMAC (his face against concrete) Man, I must really be stoned. (wipes tears from his face with his hand) Thanks, buddy. \nCLAIR Honey? \nMac raises his hand, arrests her from coming nearer. \nMAC I'm fine, babe. \nJERRY Give him a minute, Clair. \nMAC (humiliated) Hey. (looks over at Jerry) Thanks, buddy. \nJERRY Anytime, sport. \nMAC (wants to say \"don't call me sport\") Yeah, thanks pal. \nCLAIR (helpless) Honey? \nThey all stand around watching him.  Mac gets up. \nMAC I'm fine, babe.  I'm gonna take a little walk.  I need a minute.  Let's forget it. My life didn't pass in front of my eyes. So, it probably wasn't that close. \nJERRY Probably not. \nMAC (to Jerry) So, you've got lifeguard papers, or what? \nJUDY There's a test, you know. \nJERRY (embarrassed) Forget it, Judy. \nCLAIR (still scared) Honey? \nMAC I'll be fine.  Really babe.  Give me a minute. \nThe CAMERA stays on Mac as he walks around the side of the house, down the steps through the basement. \nINT. BASEMENT - MEDIUM FULL SHOT \nMac begins to tremble, sob convulsively.  He bites down on his lip, clinches his first, tries to pull himself together. \nMAC (paces; at himself) You're okay.  Buck up.  Come on, be a man.  It could happen to anybody. (tears start again) If you don't stop, I'm going to punch your face in. (another moment) \nHe pulls a towel off a stack and they all fall on the floor. \nMAC (CONT'D) Oh shit.  I can't fucking do anything right.  Come on, come on.  Oh thank you God for giving me this chance.  Thank you for having Jerry here to save me.  I promise I will never cheat on my wife again.  I will never take drugs again, and I will be a great fucking husband and a loving father.  I am a great father!  I have terrific friends.  I am a brilliant director.  Well-respected.  I won a Golden Globe, how 'bout that?  Yeah, man, it's alright, it's alright, it's alright. And God, I will be humble. \nINT. MUSIC LIBRARY - MEDIUM FULL SHOT \nGina regards the photographs she brought for Joe and Sally. She lifts it from the shelf, the phone rings, the machine picks up. \nMAN'S VOICE Joe, Joe!  It's your Dad!  Pick up, Joe... \nGina sets the photo on the desk, leans it up against the wall.  Joe and Sally's faces stare out of it. \nGINA (picks up receiver) Harry, hi, it's Gina!  Gina.  Is everything alright? (a deep intake of breath) Oh my God.  When?  He's not here. They're out looking for Otis.  The dog, Harry. (tears start down her face) I love you so much.  Lucy's a fighter, she'll make it.  Whether she wants to or not.  Harry.  I'm so sorry.  I will. (writes down the number) Yes I will.  Take care, Harry.  Bye. \nShe puts down the phone.  Stares into Joe's face, looks up at a photo on the wall that she took of Joe and Lucy. \nEXT. BACKYARD LANDING \nJerry and Judy are making out. \nJUDY Are you my big brave boy?  Are you my brave hero? \nJERRY You're crazy baby.  I love you. \nJoe's legs give way.  He sort of sits on the floor. \nJOE (laughs; shakes his head) Stupid tart. \nGINA She left a note. \nJOE (realizes the import; to Gina) Fuck you. \nTears start down Sally's face. \nGINA You need to call your dad. \nJOE Leave us alone right now. \nGINA I've booked you a flight and packed you a bag.  You just need to get into a car and go. \nSALLY Would you leave us alone right now? \nGINA I love her too, Joe. \nJOE Alright, good.  Thanks for your trouble. So will you leave Sally and me alone right now? \nSALLY (a shrug; simply) Everybody hates the messenger. \nGina exits. \nSALLY (CONT'D) (to Joe) I'm coming with you. \nJoe starts to cry.  Sally holds him, kisses him, strokes him, rocks him. \nJOE (inconsolable) I don't want you to go. \nHe wipes tears away that start afresh; his nose is running, he wipes that too. \nJOE (CONT'D) I can't got tonight.  I don't want to be on a plane on my own tonight. \nSALLY I'll be with you. \nJOE I don't want to go tonight. \nSALLY You don't have to. \nThey sit on the floor.  Sally soothing, rocking Joe like a baby. \nJOE (bereft) Stupid tart. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATER \nGina's put up some coffee.  Sophia, Cal, Mac and Clair stand around awkwardly.  Sally comes into the room. \nMAC How's he doing? \nSALLY Not good. \nGINA He's gonna miss his flight. \nSALLY Yeah. \nAl the guests are a little stunned. \nGINA Is he not going?  I booked a flight. \nSALLY He's not going tonight. \nGINA I told his father he'd be on that flight. \nSALLY Well you could tell him otherwise.  It was good of you to be all this help.  But he doesn't want to go tonight. \nGINA Jesus, Sally.  I'm not the enemy. \nSALLY And you're not the wife. \nGINA It's not a contest. \nSALLY Damn straight. \nEXT.

KITCHEN - FROM MONICA AND RYAN'S POV \nSally and Joe are alone in the room.  They hold each other, weep... \nRYAN (appalled) Jesus Christ, it's a fucking dog! \nMONICA (regards them) Don't go in, Ryan. \nRYAN What? \nMONICA Let's just go home, okay? \nINT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nA much embarrassed Panes and Skye enter. \nPANES Coffee? \nJOE Sure. \nPANES I'll do it. \nPanes starts to make some; Skye starts to clean up glasses and ashtrays. \nSALLY You don't need to do that. \nSKYE I don't mind... \nSALLY Relax.  You've done enough. \nEXT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nWe see Judy and Jerry bounding around the side of the house. Jerry has his briefcase in his hand.  They are laughing. They enter the kitchen.

(puts the call on hold) It's Skye Davidson.  She needs directions to the house.  You invited Skye fucking Davidson to our anniversary party? \nJOE Okay.  I'm sorry, look, I meant to tell you.  It was the only chance I had to meet her. \nSALLY You invited her to our anniversary party? I didn't even invite my mother. \nJOE She goes on location tomorrow.  Sally, I'm sorry.  Look, I can't keep her on hold. \nSALLY (pissed) No, no of course not.  It's Skye fucking Davidson, for fuck's sake. \nJOE (regards her) You want me to uninvite her? \nSALLY No, no of course not.  How old is she? Twenty-fucking-two? \nShe gets out of bed, starts into the bathroom.  The CAMERA is with her. \nSALLY (CONT'D) (into the bathroom mirror) And she's a stinking fucking actress, for fuck's sake. \nJOE (into the receiver) Skye! (his face lights) I'm so glad you're able to make it...it's our sixth, actually. (flattered) You read the book again?  Well, no, the ending to chapter six...it's just that it's not filmic. We tried it in an earlier draft, but, it just wasn't filmic... Well, sure, we can absolutely look at that again.  If you're coming from Laurel, you want to take Sunset west, we're just past Will Rogers State Park.  Three blocks west of that, you want to hang right.  It's about three quarters of a mile up a big white thing on the left. \nSally's started the bath, and is watching him from the doorway.  He meets her eyes mid-sentence. \nJOE (CONT'D) Oh?  I don't think tonight.  I'm sure they're well behaved.  All our friends have dogs, and they always want to bring them.  We'd be outnumbered, you see?  So we sort of put a ban on it.  Sorry. \nHe rolls his eyes.  Sally walks back into the bathroom, she isn't buying it. \nJOE (O.S.) (CONT'D) I'm looking forward to meeting you, too. And Skye, I'm thrilled that you're willing to take this leap with me. Eternally grateful, really. \nSALLY (into the bathroom mirror) I'm going to throw up. \nJOE (O.S.) I can't imagine anyone else playing Genna. \nSALLY (sanguine) Really? \nINT. BEDROOM - LATER \nThe doorbell rings.  There are two closed doors on either side of the room.

FOYER - EARLY EVENING \nThe house is filled with exquisite flower arrangements, candles everywhere. \nJERRY and JUDY ADAMS are on the porch, just beyond the glass of the front door.  Their argument is inaudible.  They're in their mid-thirties, conservatively dressed.  She's stunning, genetically nervous.  Jerry carries a briefcase.  She's got the gift. \n", "test1_true": "JUDY I know we're early, we're so early. Sorry. \nJERRY You have to sign your taxes anyway. \nSALLY (a grin) Of course we do.

Six months ago, who would have thunk it? \nJerry hugs Joe. \nJOE (sotto) Well, not me, to be honest. \nJERRY (sotto) Don't fuck up again.  It's got a ripple effect.  Sally suffers, we all suffer. \nJUDY (offers) We have a gift? \nJOE Thanks, I'll take that.  Champagne? \nJUDY Lovely. \nJoe moves toward the kitchen. \nJERRY (a moment, to Sally) We closed. \nSALLY Fantastic. (takes his hand) Out here. \nThey step out onto the porch.

PORCH - CONTINUOUS \nJERRY Joe officially owns No. 4, Cheyenne Walk, Chelsea, London, England.  No small doing. \nSALLY I love you, you're a genius. \nBehind them, in the foyer, Judy wanders aimlessly. \nJERRY I suppose.  Sally, that's quite a gift. I'm not sure it's in your best interest. \nSALLY I adore him. \nJERRY The realtor'll be here tomorrow in the morning.  The house had to go on the market to insure the loan on the London flat. \nSALLY I know.  I know that.  Don't spoil it. \nJERRY What you earn has to double in order to cover expenses in London, it's an outrageously expensive city. \nSALLY We've only been over this how many times? \nJERRY You only made half your quote this year. \nSALLY Well, you're a tower of support. \nJERRY I worry because you don't.  It's my job. I'm feeling guilty.  I would've liked it if you waited until the two of you were on more solid ground. \nSALLY (direct, simple) We couldn't be on more solid ground. \nJERRY Whatever you say.  Listen, I love you. \nOtis is barking. \nJOE (O.S.) Otis!  No barking! \nSALLY (touched) And Joe's huge in Europe.  He's like a rock star in London.

You saved my life. \nShe moves past them. \nSALLY (a moment; sotto) Shit! \nPANES (re: the dress) I'd cut off her red wine if I were you. \nSALLY Shit.

LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMore guests have arrived.  Sophia and her children play with Otis.  America and Rosa pass round hot hors d'oeuvres. \nJoe places Gina's photo on the mantelpiece. \nGINA (regards him) Directing suits you. \nJOE I'm not so sure.  Look again in three months. \nGINA It must be nice having so many strangers kiss your ass all of a sudden. \nJOE Ow!  Gina, you obviously need to get fucked. \nGINA Just did.  Jealous? \nJOE When does he graduate high school? \nGINA (laughing) Oh, very jealous. \nJoe laughs. \nGINA (CONT'D) I saw Lucy when I was in London, she seems okay.  It's hard to tell with her. \nJOE Shit, I forgot to call her back.  She's off on a trip somewhere.  Oh God, my grandad's flat in London's been sold. \nGINA In Cheyene Walk?  Lucy's going to have a meltdown.  Oh, I'm so sorry. \nJOE I should have damn well bought it.  Well, we can't afford it.  The movie's going to eat up a year of my life and I'm getting paid next to nothing.  Do you know how much Skye Davidson's getting?  Four million. \nGINA Yeah, but I hear she gives a mean blow job. \nJOE You really need to be fucked. \nINT.

You're stronger than you think. \nThey lie prone across the bed, about a foot apart. Contemplating the floor. \nPANES (CONT'D) (finally) How's the movie going?  Your movie.  You are making a movie, aren't you? \nSALLY Yes.  Fine. \n", "test2_true": "SALLY I don't want to talk about it. \nPANES Why not? \nSALLY I never like to talk about my work. \nPANES Alright.  Well, that's something new. \nSALLY No.  Not something new. \nPANES Well, something's wrong. \nSALLY Nothing's wrong.  It's great, okay? Having the time of my life.  Mac's a fantastic director.

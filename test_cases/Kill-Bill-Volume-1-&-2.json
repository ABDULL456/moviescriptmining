Do you find me sadistic? \nCUT TO: \nBLACK AND WHITE CU of a WOMAN lying on the floor, looking up. The woman on the floor has just taken a severe spaghetti-western-style gang beating. Her face is bloody, beaten up, and torn. The high contrast B/W turning the red blood into black blood. \nA hand belonging to the off-screen Man's Voice ENTERS FRAME holding a white handkerchief with the name \"BILL\" sewn in the corner, and begins tenderly wiping away the blood from the young woman's face. Little by little as the Male Voice speaks, the beautiful face underneath is revealed to the audience. But what can't be wiped away, is the white hot hate that shines in both eyes at the man who stands over her, the \"BILL\" of the title. \nIn another    age men who shook the world for their    own purposes were called    conquerors. In our age, the men who    shake the planet for    their own power and greed are called    corrupters. And of the    world's corrupters Bill stands alone.    For while he \ncorrupts the world, inside himself he is pure. \nBILL'S VOICE (O.S.) I bet I could fry an egg on your head about now, if I wanted to. \nHe continues wiping away the blood. \nBILL'S VOICE (O.S.) No kiddo, I'd like to believe, even now, you're aware enough to know there isn't a trace of sadism in my actions... Okay - Maybe towards these other jokers - bot not your. \nOVERHEAD SHOT We see for a moment, A WIDE SHOT looking down at the woman on the floor. Bill (from behind) bent down over her. Four others in black suits, standing over her (three are female, one is male). And about four DEAD BODIES lying in their own blood. We also see we're in a wedding chapel that's been redecorated by blood death and gunfire. And firstly or lastly, depending on the viewer, that the woman on the floor is dressed in a white bridal gown. This woman is our Heroine, and from this moment forth she will only be referred to as The BRIDE. \nBack to CU of The BRIDE. \nThe BRIDE on the floor. Her pretty face is wiped clean. \nBILL'S VOICE (O.S.) No Kiddo at this moment, this is me at my most masochistic. \nWhile still in her CU The Bride speaks for the first time in the picture. She looks up at the man standing over her and says; \nTHE BRIDE Bill, I'm pregnant. It's your baby. \nAfter saying the \"y\" in \"baby\", we hear a BANG and The Bride receives a bullet in the side of her head. \nCUT TO: BLACK SCREEN: Presentation Credit \n\"The 4th Film by QUENTIN TARANTINO\" \nCUT TO: \nB/W CU of a Young MAN in a TUXEDO. Shot to death. \nThe BRIDE speaks to us in a VO; \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) That's Tim, Arthur's best friend. \nCU A PRETTY YOUNG WOMAN in a frilly pink dress with two bullet holes in her. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) That's his girlfriend Janeen. \nCU A PLUMP YOUNG WOMAN, shot to death, wedding bouquet still clutched in her dead fist. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) That's my best friend from work Erica. \nAN OLDER MAN IN A BLACK SUIT shot fulla holes. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) That's the minister. I think his name was Reverend Hillhouse. \nA DEAD OLDER WOMAN by his side in an old-fashioned flower print dress. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) That's his wife. \nA DEAD OLDER WOMAN slumped over an organ. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) Organ player, don't know her name. \nA YOUNG MAN IN A TUXEDO WITH HIS FACE BLOWN OFF. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) That's Arthur. Arthur Plympton. The \nname on his driver's license was Charles Arthur Plympton, but for some reason he preferred Arthur. Maybe if he went by Carles people would have called him Charlie. If that was his reason for going by Arthur I can understand it. Nothing wrong with the name Charlie, except he didn't look like a Charlie, he looked like an Arthur. Obviously you'll have to take my word on this. Speaking of names, I was about two seconds away from becoming Mrs. Charles Arthur Plympton. \nAnd then finally, The Bride. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) And that, that's me. I'm the Bride. \nWe do a DISSOLVE from the Bride looking dead in the bridal gown \nTo \nThe Bride, still in B/W, still in a bridal gown, but the asswippin she took in the scene before must have been in the past, because she looks like a million dollars now.......three million even. \nINT. CAR (MOVING) - NIGHT \nThe Bride behind the wheel of a Volkswagen Karman Ghia convertible. Her long blodne hair whipping in the wind. A PROCESS SHOT PLAYS behind her. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) Looked dead, didn't I? Well I wasn't, but it wasn'T for lack fo trying, I can tell you that. Actually Bill's last bullet put me in a coma. A coma I was to lie in for five years. When I woke up, ...I went on what the movie advertisements refer to as a Roaring Rampage of Revenge. I roarded and I rampaged and I got bloody satisfaction. In all, I've killed 33 people to get to this piont right now. I have only one more. The last one. \nThe one I'M driving to right now. The only one left. And when I arrive at my destination..... .... I'm gonna Kill Bill. \nTITLE SEQUENCE \nAs a female-sung ballad of heartbreaking lament plays on the soundtrack, we see the credits of \"Kill Bill\" play over the Bride in her bridal gown, driving to the film's climax. \nThe sequence ends with the Bride arriving at Bill's home. \nWE FADE TO BLACK \nBLACK FRAME TITLE APPEARS: \nChapter one \nCUT TO: \nEX CU The BRIDE's EYEBALL IN GLORIOUS COLOR WE CUT OUT ONE...TWO...THREE...TO A CU of The BRIDE IN GLORIOUS COLOR She's sitting in a parked pickup truck. Her eyes focused on something. \nThe BRIDE'S POV: A very homey three-bedroom house in the affluent suburb of Pasadena, California. A purple Dodge Neon sits parked in the driveway. A tricylce, a big wheel, and a few toys sprinkle the grass on the front yard. A mailbox with the name \"The BELLS\" on it sits out in front of the lawn. We hear but don't see ice cream truck bells. \nSUBTITLE APPEARS AT SCREEN BOTTOM: \n\"The city of PASADENA, CALIFORNIA\" \nWe hear a Car Door Open and Close....THEN....The Bride Walks into the shot, heading for the front door. \nEX CU: A long, white female finger pushes a doorbell. \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL PASADENA STREET - DAY \nThe front door opens and an attractive black HOUSEWIFE the same age as The Bride stands in the doorway. The Housewife's face shows immediate recognition of the blonde on her doorstep. \nThe BRIDE on the porch; we do a quick Shaw-Brothers-style Zoom into her eyes. \nFLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE (That means our Heroine is remembering something, and we see it with an orange filter.) We're back inside the wedding chapel. The Bride is taking the beating of her life by four people in black suits. A black woman PUNCHES HER in the face... WE see it's the black housewife, five years earlier. \nThe BRIDE ON THE PORCH We Zoom quick out of her eyes to CU, a VENGEANCE THEME PLAYS LOUD ON THE SOUNDTRACK. (Whenever we hear this theme throughout the picture, we'll quickly learn what accompanies it is The Bride goin Krakatoa all over whoever's ass happens to be in front of her at that moment.) As the Vengeance Theme plays, a Vein in The Bride's forehead begins to pulsate. When the Vengeance Theme stops, The Bride ATTACKS The Housewife. \nINT. HOUSEWIFE'S NICE HOME - DAY \nThe white woman and the black woman FLY into the center of the living room, CRASHING onto her coffe table in front of the sofa. \nVERNITA You have every right to wanna get even -- \nTHE BRIDE -- But that's where you're wrong, Vernita. I don't want to get even. To get even, even Steven. I would have to kill you, go into Nikki's room, kill her, then wait for your old man, Dr. Bell, to come home and kill him. That would make us even. No, my unborn daughter will just hafta be satisfied with your death at her mother's hands. \nVernita knows no matter what else is said, blood will spill. \nVERNITA When do we do this? \nTHE BRIDE It all depends... When do you want to die? Tomorrow? The day after tomorrow? That's about as long as I'll wait. \nVERNITA How bout tonight, bitch? \nTHE BRIDE Spendid. Where? \nVERNITA There's a baseball diamond where our little league has its games, about a mile from here. We meet there around two-thirty in the morning, dressed all in black, your hair in a black stocking, and we have us a knife fight, we won't be \nbothered. I have to fix Nikki's cereal. \nAs they continue to talk, Vernita pulls down a cereal bowl for her daughter and lays it on the kitchen counter. \nTHE BRIDE Bill said you were one of the best ladies he'd ever seen with an edged weapon. \nVernita moves to another kitchen cabinet, and pulls down a box of the sugar cereal, \"Kaboom.\" \nVERNITA Fuck you, bitch, I know he didn't qualify it, so you can just kiss my motherfuckin ass, Black Mamba. (snorts to herself) Black Mamba, I shoulda been motherfuckin Black Mamba. \nAs the two females continue to talk, Vernita reaches her hand inside the cereal box. \nTHE BRIDE Weapon of choice? And if you want to stick with your butcher knife, I'm cool with that. \nVERNITA Very funny. \nVernita FIRES A GUN from inside the cereal box at The Bride.... \n.... The bullet explodes out of the cardboard box, and HITS the coffee mugh directly in front of The Bride, BLOWING IT TO SMITHEREENS. \nThe Bride THROWS HERSELF ON THE FLOOR.... \nVernita pulls the gun out of the cereal box and FIREES again... \n...The bullet HITS THE FLOOR of the tiny kitchen... \n...The Bride moves under the kitchen table, then using her back, LIFTS THE TABLE OFF THE GROUND, RAMMING IT STRAIGHT INTO Vernita, pinning her flat up against the table top, and the kitchen counter. \nWhile her left hand holds the table,    her right hand goes to the SOG on her belt, her fingers wrap    around the blade's grip, lifting it up out of the sheath    and PLUNGING IT THROUGH THE TABLE TOP up to the handle, with    all the SOG's steel entering Vernita's abdomen. \nThe table falls back to the floor with the dying homemaker pinned to it. The two former colleagues meet eyes. \nVERNITA Sorry, bout the bushwhack. Please don't... \nTHE BRIDE Do to your daughter, what you did to mine... (she takes her hand) ...I won't. \nVernita dies. \nThe Bride removes her Sog, looks up and sees little Nikki standing in the doorway of her room. The little girl sees her mother dead on the floor, lying in her own blood. And she sees the blonde lady standing over her mother, bloody knife still in her hand. But oddly enough, Nikki doesn't cry. The little girl locks eyes with the big girl, and holds her stare. \nAs she    talks to the little girl, she removes an already stained    with blood white handkerchief with the name \"BILL\" sewn on    it. And the blonde wipes the girl's mother's blood off her    blade. \nTHE BRIDE It was not my intention to do this in front of you. For that I'm sorry. But you can take my word for it, your mother had it coming. When you grow up, if you still feel raw about it, I'll be waiting. \nAnd with that apology, statement, and invitation, The Bride walks out the kitchen side door, leaving the little girl to her mourning. \nEXT. VERNITA'S HOME - DAY \nThe Bride walks down the dead woman's driveway to her vehicle. She glances at the lawn toys one more time as she makes here getaway. \nShe climbs into her big, yellow pickup truck, with the words \"Pussy Wagon\" written across the flatbed's hatch door in a pimpy font. She takes out a ringed notebook and turns to a page that's headline reads; \nDEATH LIST FIVE \nOn the pager are five names numbered going down the page written in red ink. \nThe first name has a line drawn through it with black ink. \nThe second name on the list is; \nVERNITA GREEN COBRA \nThe Bride takes a black felt pen and draws a line through Vernita's name. Turns on the truck's engine and drives out of the residential district. \nFADE TO BLACK. OVER BLACK TITLE CARD: \nChapter two \nThe comatose Bride \nFADE UP ON \nCU The comatose Bride lying in her hospital bed, wide open unblinking sightless eyes, that constantly stare yet see nothing. The Bride is at the beginning of her comatose journey. \nA SUBTITLE APPEARS: under her face. \n\"Five years and four months earlier in the city of El Paso, Texas\" \nAlthough we're only in a tight CU, we can tell a few things: one, she's in her hospital room; two, she's alone; three, it's night; and four, one hellva RAINSTORM is pounding outside. \nEXT. EL PASO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nThe rain pisses down in buckets in front of the hospital... \nWHEN... \nThe wheel to an Alfa Romeo rolls into FRAME and stops. \nThe car door opens and two yellow galoshes step out into the wet night. \nOVERHEAD SHOT A red umbrella opens as rain falls down. \nCU the back of a head wearing a yellow rainslicker hood, framed by the red umbrella above it, which water cascades down and beats a rhythm against. \nThe figure in the yellow rainslicker with the red umbrella (who we can guess is female) starts walking towards the hospital. \nWE GO TO SPLIT SCREEN \nLeft Side                   Right Side CU The Bride's unblinking        The back of the yellow comatose sleep.                  slicker - walking in the rain towards the hospital's entrance. \nCU her yellow galoshes slapping against the wet asphalt, and splashing through puddles. \nCU The Bride in her coma         CU the hospital's electrical doors - WOOSH - OPEN. \nWe follow behind the woman in the raincoat as she walks from outside into the hospital down the hall, and into the ladies room door. \nCU The BRIDE                     EX CU OF A WHITE in her coma                      WOMAN'S SHAPELY BAREFOOT ANKLE AND LEG stepping into a sheer, white stocking. \nINSERT: OF THOSE LONG, WHITE LEGS STEPPING INTO A WHITE NURSE'S UNIFORM. \nINSERT: OF THE ZIPPER IN THE BACK ZIPPING UPWARDS. \nINSERT: OF WHITE, SHEER STOCKING FEET STEPPING INTO WHITE NURSE'S ORTHOPEDIC SHOES. \n-                          INSERT: OF A SYRINGE NEEDLE STUCK IN A VIAL The liquid is drawn up into the syringe. \nSOME WRITTEN TEXT APPEARS BELOW IMAGE THAT READS: \n\"A lethal cocktail of Bill's own concoction. He calls it, 'Goodbye forever'.\" \nINSERT: THE DEADLY SYRINGE IS PLACED ON A NURSE'S TRAY \nINSERT:    A LITTLE WHITE NURSE'S    CAP IS PLACED ON TOP    of the woman's blonde    head. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThe door marked \"ladies\" is opened, and a beautiful 6-foot blonde in a white nurse's uniform, with a matching white eye patch over her left eye, steps out, carrying the nurse's tray with the \"Goodbye forever\"-filled syringe on it. She walks down the corridor towards The sleeping Bride's room. \nCAMERA MOVES UP TO Orderly's face, leading two TRUCKDRIVERS. The Bride HEARS BILL'S VOICE SPEAK FOR THE ORDERLY; \nBILL'S VOICE                            ORDERLY (in time)                              (in time) She's right in here.                She's right in here. \nSPLIT SCREEN FINISHES STAY WITH The BRIDE'S SCREEN \nThe Bride decides the best course    of action,    till she gets her bearings, is to play possum.    She throws    herself back down on the bed, just as the three men    enter her    room. They see just what they expected    to see, The    Bride lying in her bed in her coma. \nShe duplicates her comatose eyes-wide-open-fixed stare. Except knowing she's awake, and sees everything in front of her, creates a slightly different effect. \nThe Bride, however, while she sees the Two Truckdrivers for what they are, when she sees The Orderly she sees Bill, when The Orderly talks she hears Bill. WE HOWEVER WILL NEVER SEE BILL'S FACE COMPLETELY. \nThe Orderly takes her shee covering off, and hitches up her hospital gown till her blonde pussy is exposed. He does kind of a \"TA-DA\" presentation of her vagina. \nTHE ORDERLY Now is that the cutest little blonde pussy you ever saw, or is that the cutest little blonde pussy, YOU-EVEA-SAW? \nTrucker #2 (Gerald) would tend to agree, Trucker #1 (Warren) fronts. \nWARREN I seen better. \nCU The BRIDE EYES WIDE OPEN PLAYING POSSUM. She can't believe she's being exhibited in this manner. A look of chagrin crosses her trying-to-be expressionless face, \"I've seen a fuck load better than you, fatass.\" \nTHE ORDERLY Yeah, in a movie - maybe. But I know damn well this is the best pussy you ever saw you had touchin rights to. The price is seventy five dollars a fuck gentlemen, you gittin your freak on or what? \nThe Truckers pay the bill of fare. \nAs The Orderly counts The Truckers' money, he lays out the rules; \nTHE ORDERLY Here's the rules; Rule    number one; no punchin 'er. Nurse comes in tomorrow    an she got 'er a shiner - or less    some teeth, jig's up. So no knuckle    sandwiches under no circumstances.    And by the \nway, this little cunt's a spitter - it's a motor reflex thing but spit or no, no punchin. Now are we absolutely positively clear about rule number one? \nTWO TRUCKERS Yeah. \nTHE ORDERLY Rule number two; No monkey bites, no hickeys - in fact no leavin no marks of no kind. But after that, it's allll goooood. Her plummin down there don't work no more, so feel free to cum in 'er all ya wont. Keep the noise down - try not to make a mess, and I'll be back in twenty. \nThe Orderly turns to leave, then remembers something, and turns back. He takes out the most disgusting jar of vaseline in the history of cinema, and hands it to Warren. \nTHE ORDERLY Oh by the way, not all the time, but sometimes this cunt's cunt can get drier than a bucket of sand. If she dry, lube up with this and you'll be goo to go. BON-APPETIT, gentlemen. \nAnd with that, The Orderly's gone. \nThe BRIDE'S POV: As soon as he leaves the Two Truckers start giggling. Warren begins to unbuckle the belt that lies beneath his belly. While he looks down to accomplish this, The BRIDE'S POV BLINKS. \nGERALD Hey Warren, she just blinked. \nWARREN He said she can't blink. \nGERALD I know what he said, I'm tellin ya \nshe just did. \nWarren drops his Levi's to his ankles. \nWARREN Just wait, when I get through with this little dumbbell, she gonna stand up and recite the Gettysburg Ad-dress. \nWarren begins to climb up on the bed and mount The Bride. Before he does he stops, and looks back to Gerald. \nWARREN Hey, Gerald. \nGERALD Yeah? \nWARREN This shit ain't no peep show. Go out in the hall and I'll let ya know when it's your turn. \nGERALD Awww c'mon, I gotta leave the room? \nWARREN I can't get no errection wit you lookin at me, so go on. \nGERALD Well, just hurry up then. \nGerald leaves the room; we go out with him in the hallway. \nINT. HALLWAY (HOSPITAL) - NIGHT \nGerald paces, waiting for his turn behind the door. \nTHEN... \nHe hears behind the door a commotion, then Warren SCREAM LIKE A BITCH. He bangs on the closed door and says; \nGERALD He man, keep it down in there, I can hear your ass out here. \nMore falsetto SCREAMS behind the door... \nTHEN... \nThe HEAVY THUD of a body falling. Not what the expected. \nINT. THE BRIDE'S ROOM - NIGHT \nGerald pushes open the door to see one hellva sight. His buddy, bloody and lying motionless on the floor, and The Bride lying haphazardly on the bed, in her coma. \nHe moves to his buddy, who's dead. Then moves to The comatose Bride... Who SUDDENLY SPRINGS TO LIFE, GRABBING him by the front of his shirt, YANKING HIM DOWN TO HER, and PLUNGING the I.V. NEEDLE in her arm DEEP INTO HIS TEMPLE, THEN TWISTING IT AROUND and AROUND, turning the right side of his brain into scrambled eggs a la The BRIDE. She tosses the now brain-dead Gerald to the floor. \nThe BRIDE upon waking, without leaving the bed    where she lay the last five years, has just killed two men.    She throws off the bloody blankets, whips her legs off    the side of the bed, and tries to stand - THEN QUICKLY FALLS    OUT OF FRAME. WE HEAR THE CRASH BELOW FRAME. \nThe Bride is flat on the floor. Her legs and feet don't work. Which means she's stuck on the floor with only a functioning top half, and a completely useless bottom half. What's a girl to do? \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThe elevator doors open, and The Orderly steps out. \nBACK TO The BRIDE She hears the sound of Bill's boots approaching the room... STEP...STEP...STEP... \nShe sees Gerald has a Trucker's knife in a holster attached to his belt. Her hands removes it. \nThe Orderly swaggers down the hall to The Bride's room, red Reeboks slapping against the smooth floor. \nCU The BRIDE She SNAPS the knife's BLADE OPEN in her CU. \nThe Orderly pushes open The Bride's door, stopping in shock. \nThe ORDERLY'S POV: He sees an empty bed with bloodstains on it, Two dead Truckers on the floor, and no Bride. \nORDERLY Oh shit! \nWE GO TO SLOW MOTION    as he freaks, Then PAN DOWN HIM... Past shirts - pants - to    his Reeboks...Once on the floor WE SEE The BRIDE, curled up    low next to the doorway, behind his ankles, knife ready.    WE GO BACK TO 24 FRAMES A SECOND. He steps into the room;    when he does The Bride reaches out and SLASHES both of his    Achilles tendons. \nThe STANDING ORDERLY lets out a \"YELP,\" adn FALLS OUT OF FRAME. \nIMPACT CUT The Orderly HITTING the floor face first. The boy is stunned. \nThe BRIDE (Confined to the floor) crawls over and drags the stunned fucker across the floor, placing his melon head between the door and the door frame. Then taking the door in her right hand. \nSLAM! \nSLAM! \nSLAM! \nSLAMMING HIS HEAD THREE TIMES BETWEEN THE DOOR AND THE DOOR FRAME. \nThe ORDERLY lies on the floor in a stange state of consciousness. He's in both excruciating pain, and quite sure he's lost his mind, since at this moment he's lying on the floor, looking up at The comatose Bride asking him questions. \nTHE BRIDE Where's Bill? \nTHE ORDERLY (hurt and confused) Who? \nSLAM! \nHe screams. \nTHE BRIDE Bill! Where is Bill! \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) It was at that age, a half-Chinese, half-Japanese American Army brat witnessed the murder of her Master Sergeant father. And the rape, then murder of her mother at the hands of Japan's most ruthless Yakuza boss, Boss Matsumoto. She swore revenge...luckily for her, Boss Matsumoto was a pedophile. \nSHOCK CUT O-REN ON TOP OF BOSS MATSUMOTO PLUNGING A HUGE KNIFE INTO HIS CHEST. A STREAM OF RED BLOOD SHOOTS UP OUT OF HIM like a geyser. Boss is naked, O-Ren wears a Japanese schoolgirl uniform. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) At thirteen, she got her revenge. \nThe Boss's screams cause TWO OF BOSS'S MEN to run into the room, only to be SHOT DOWN by O-Ren, as she removes a gun from a holster strapped to her thigh. \nThe 20-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII on a rooftop with a high-powered, scope-sight rifle up to her eye. Her EYE is HUGELY MAGNIFIED in the SCOPE. \nTHE BRIDE By twenty, she was one of the tip top of female assassins in the world. \nShe fires. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nA Central American General riding backseat    of his government vehicle. TWO BEAUTIFUL LATIN WOMEN in one-   piece bathing suits sit on either side of him. They both wear    sashes down their front; one reads, \"Miss Panama,\" the other    reads, \"Miss Venezuela.\" As we cut to this shot, he has    both hands on each of their bare knees. He's laughing as the    TOP OF HIS HEAD is BLOWN OFF. \nThe 23-YEAR OLD O-REN ISHII stands before Bill and The Bride. (Bill is not clearly viewed.) \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) At twenty-three she joined Bill's Deadly Vipers... \nThe 25-YEAR-OLD O-REN ISHII BEATING UP the pregnant Bride with the other Vipers... \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) At twenty five she did her part in the killing of eight innocent people, including my unborn daughter, in a small wedding chapel in El Paso Texas. But on that day, five years ago, she made one big mistake... \nPOSED FIGURE of the BRIDE in all her pre-beating bridal gown glory. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) ...she Should of killed nine. However, before statisfaction would be mine, first things first... \nCU The BRIDE IN BUCK'S TRUCK An hour and a half later from the last time we saw her. \nTHE BRIDE Wiggel your big toe. \nCU The BRIDE'S BIG TOE wiggles - slightly. \nTHE BRIDE Hart part's over.

We see dirt, rocks, plants, and an oil derrick pumping up and down. \nThe Bride thinks the restaurant so small it's almost hard to imagine there could be a back room to it. \nBefore getting a response from whoever it was he was yelling to a moment ago, The Sushi Chef turns back to The Bride. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) -- What other Japanese you learn? \nThe Bride puts on a thinking face. \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Oh...let's see...\"Arigato.\" \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) \"Arigato\"...Very good. \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) ...\"Ah-So\"... \nSUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE) \"Ah-So!\" You know what \"Ah-So\" means\u00df \nTHE BRIDE \"I See.\" \nSUSHI CHEF I see - Very good. \nTHE BRIDE I already said \"Domo\", right? \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Yes. \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) \"Kon-netie-wa.\" \nThe Sushi Chef goes \"Oooh\" like he's just discovered the answer to a mystery. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) ...\"Kon-nichi-wa\"...repeat please. \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) \"Kon-nichi-wa?\" \nSaying with surprise and admiration; \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Most impressive...you say Japanese words, like you Japanese. \nThe Bride smiles and lets loose with a girlish giggle. \nTHE BRIDE Now you're making fun of me. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) No no no - serious business. Pronunciation - very good. You say \"Arigato\" ...like we say \"Arigato.\" \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Well, thank you - I mean...arigato. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) You should learn Japanese - very easy. \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) No kidding, I heard it's kinda hard. \nWhenever the Sushi Chef doesn't either hear your or understand you, he yells the word; \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) What! \nAnd everybody always speaks LOUDER and CLEARER immediately afterwards. \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) I always heard it was difficult. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Yes yes yes - most difficult. But you have Japanese tongue. \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Maybe I was Japanese in another life. \nThe Sushi Chef proclaims as if he should know; \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Most definitely, most definitely Japanese in another life. \nHe sets an order of colorful, raw fish in front of the young blonde woman, that not only looks good, it looks beautiful. \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) How did you know tuna's my favorite? \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) What! \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Tuna's my favorite. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Ah, thank you very much. \nHe YELLS    OFFSCREEN in Japanese agai. A little BALD JAPANESE MAN with    a shitty attitude, comes out from the back room. He heads for    the tall blonde asking in a grumbly voice in Japanese,    \"What she wants to drink?\" \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) (to the bald man) I beg your pardon? \nThe Sushi Chef pantomimes drinking. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) - Drink - \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Oh yes, a bottle of warm sake. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Ahhh sake, (he holds up his thumb) Very good. \nIn Japanese he YELLS/ORDERS the warm sake, the little Bald Man disappears. The Bride takes a bite out of her fish. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) First time in Japan? \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) A-huh. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) What! \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Yes, this is my first time. \nAs the chef slices the next portion with a large knife, he asks; \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) What brings you to Okinawa? \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) I came to see a man. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Aaahh, you have friend live in Okinawa? \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Not quite. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) Not friend? \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) I've never met him. \nThe Sushi Chef continues slicing..... \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) \nWho is he, may I ask? \nTHE BRIDE Hattori Hanzo. \nThere's a break in the Sushi Chef's slicing. After a beat, he brings a bloody finger INTO FRAME and sticks it in his mouth. \nThe little Bald man appears with a bottle of warm sake, he pours one for The Bride, then disappears again. \nAs The Bride sips the sake, she looks at the chef. \nAs The Sushi Chef sucks his finger, he looks at The Bride. \nThe Sushi Chef drops the voice he had been using up to that point...and IN JAPANESE SUBTITLED IN ENGLISH asks; \nSUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE) What do you want with Hattori Hanzo? \nThe Bride answers in Japanese; \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) I need Japanese steel. \nSUSHI CHEF (JAPANESE) Why do you need Japanese steel? \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) I have vermin to kill. \nSUSHI CHEF (ENGLISH) You must have big rats you need Hattori Hanzo steel. \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) Huge. \nINT. HATTORI HANZO'S ATTIC - DAY \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) At the age of twenty, Bill backed his Nippon progeny financially and philosophically in her Shakespearian-in-magnitude power struggle with the other Yakuza clans, over who would rule vice in the city of Tokyo. \nJapamation images of O-Ren and her Army, taking on ANOTHER YAKUZA ARMY, among falling cherry blossoms. \nWE CUT BACK AND FORTH between cartoon images of this and the real life real McCoy samurai sword battle. \nO-Ren's ability is simply amazing. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) When it was all over, it was the geisha-regaled O-Ren Ishii that proved the victor. \nINT. JAPANESE NIGHT CLUB \nO-Ren has just become the official leader of crime in the city of Tokyo. The six Yakuza clan bosses, each with TWO BODYGUARDS standing behind them, toast their new leader, with much laughter and drinking...all except one...BOSS TANAKA. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) And just in case you're wondering how could a half breed Japanese Chinese American become the boss of all criminal activity in Tokyo, Japan,... I'll tell you. The subject of O-Ren's blood and nationality came up before the council only once. The night O-Ren assumed power over the crime council. \nBoss Tanaka is the picture of angered ambiance among the alcohol-fueled frivolity. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) The man who seems bound and determined to break the mood is Boss Tanaka. And what Boss Tanaka thinks is... \nBoss Tanaka brings his fist down on the table, smashing the plate in front of him into itty bitty pieces. \nThe party comes to a halt as all eyes go to the leader of the Tanaka Crime Family. \nCRIME FAMILY LEADER #2 (JAPANESE) Tanaka? What's the meaning of this outburst? This is a time for celebration. \nBOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE) And what exactly should I be celebrating? The perversion of our illustrious council? \nThe Bosses all react with shock and outrage...O-Ren remains cool. She raises her voice for the first word, but lowers it for the rest of the sentence. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Gentlemen...Boss Tanaka obviously has something on his mind. Allow him to express it. \nBOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE) My father... (looking at a clan head) ...along with yours and... (looking at another) ...along With yours, started this council. And while you drink like fish and laugh like donkeys, they weep in the afterlife over the perversion committed today. \nThe BOSSES react again...O-Ren; \nO-REN (JAPANESE) \nSilence! (then composed) Of what perversion do you speak, Tanaka? \nBoss Tanaka looks at the female half-breed American and says; \nBOSS TANAKA (JAPANESE) I speak, Mistress Ishii,....of the perversion done to this council, which I love more than my own children,...by making a half Chinese American its leader. \nThen... \nFaster than you can say Jimminy Cricket,... \nO-Ren's samurai sword is unsheathed... \nBoss Tanaka's head is liberated from its body... \nThe head hits the floor... \nAnd from the spot between its shoulder blades, a geyser of blood shoots up in the air. \nThe BOSSES who were shocked at Tanaka's words are even more flabbergasted at O-Ren's resonse. \nThe two bodyguard's, standing behind Boss Tanaka, hands go to their swords and draw them. \nO-Ren turns her blade in their direction. \nThe Bosses and their bodyguards say nothing,...only watch. \nThe lady looks across at the two men and says in and authoritative voice; \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Fight me or work for me. \nThey look at her for a moment, then they lower their swords. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Drop them on the ground. \nThey do. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Get behind me. \nThey do. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Get on your knees. \nThey do. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Put your foreheads on the floor. \nThey do. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Keep your mouths shut. \nYou better believe they do. \nThe mistress' eyes got to the other bosses looking at her. \nAs she speaks English, bodyguard translators translate for their bosses. \nO-REN I'm going to say this in English so you know how serious I am. As your leader, I encourage you to -- from time to time and always in a respectful manner, and with the complete knowledge that my decision is final -- to question my logic. If you're unconvinced a particular plan of action I've decided is the wisest, tell me so. But allow me to convince you. And I will promise you, right here and now, no subject will be taboo...except the subject that was just under discussion. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) (to a bodyguard) Hand me that head. \nHe picks it off the floor and meekly offers it to the Queen. \nShe takes it by the hair and holds it up as she speaks. \nO-REN (ENGLISH) \nThe price you pay for bringing up either my Chinese or my American heritage as a negative is, I collect your fuckin head. (now completely American) Just like this fucker here. Now if any of you sonsabitches got anything else to say, now's the fuckin time. \nNobody says anything. \nO-REN (ENGLISH) I didn't think so. (pause) Meeting adjourned. \nEXT. THE HOUSE OF BLUE LEAVES - JAPANESE RESTAURANT \nThe entire O-Ren Ishii crew moves through the restaurant. The CUSTOMERS all look up now as the crew passes. The restaurant staff acts as if the Shogun himself has just showed up on their doorstep demanding a meal. No doubt if the meal is not satisfactory the staff will gladly slice off a finger. The door to a private dining room is slid open, the crew steps inside, the door is slid shut. \nINT. PRIVATE DINING AREA (RESTAURANT) - NIGHT \nThe private dining area of the Japanese restaurant. The patrons are surrounded by white paper walls. The CAMERA CIRCLES around O-REN ISHII. \nSitting in between her, two personal bodyguards, the Yubari sisters, YUKI AND GO GO. The Yubari sisters are younger than O-Ren; Yuki is sixteen and Go Go is seventeen. Both girls are dressed in Japanese schoolgirl uniforms complete with plaid skirts and matching blazers. \nFLASH ON EX CU OF AN EYEBALL (The BRIDE's) \nOn her right is her French and Japanese lawyer, SOFIE FATALE. \nFLASH ON EX CU OF AN EYEBALL \nThe bunch of mop-topped young men, who all wear black suits, white shirts, thin black ties and Kato masks over their eyes, are her soldiers, \"The CRAZY 88.\" \nFLASH ON EX CU OF AN EAR, The Bride's fingers come into FRAME and move blonde hair out of the sensory appendage's way. \nAnd finally there's a tall dark American in a black suit sans Kato mask -- that's O-Ren's head of security, MR. BARREL. \nThey're all drinking and having a good time as Sofie tells a joke in Japanese. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) The mop tops in black suits and Kato masks were O-Ren's soldiers, \"The Crazy 88.\" The two young girls in the schoolgirl uniforms are her personal bodyguards, the Yubari sisters. Yuki, aged sixteen, and Go Go, aged seventeen. The pretty lady who's dressed like she's a villain on Star Trek is O-Ren's best friend and her lawyer, Sofie Fatale. And finally, the American in the black suit but sans Kato mask, O-Ren's head of security, Mr. Barrel. \nSUDDENLY O-Ren hears something. Like a deer in the forest, her head springs up on alert. It's almost as if she's listening to The Bride's narration. \nThe Bride's NARRATION SUDDENLY STOPS IN MIDSENTENCE -- \nO-Ren removes a SMALL DAGGER-DART from the folds of her robe and THROWS IT in the direction of the sound. \nCU The BRIDE dressed in a kimono on the other side of the private dining room's paper wall. The DART FLIES THROUGH The PAPER, STREAKS BY HER FACE, almost taking off the tip of her nose in the process. \nEX CU The EYES of The Bride, pointed down at the bodies by her feet, \n...BEAT \n...they Look back up at O-Ren. \nO-REN standing in between Go Go and Mr. Barrel. Her eyes narrow. \nThe BRIDE swipes the air with her sword, the blood of the dead attackers flies off. \nGO GO and MR. BARREL unsheath their swords. \nWHEN... \nWe hear a LOUD SOUND of many ENGINES behind the Bride. Then behind her, through the broken pictures window we see seventeen motorcycles pull up to the parking lot. All the riders wear black suits with kato masks, and all carry samurai swords. \nThe BRIDE looks from the reinforcements to O-Ren. \nO-REN smiles. \nO   -REN (ENGLISH) (to the     Bride) You didn't     think it was going to be that easy,     did you? \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) (to O-Ren) You know, for a second there, yeah I did. \nO-Ren smiles... \nO-REN (ENGLISH) Silly rabbit... \nBoth O-Ren and the Bride finish the phrase together,... \nO-REN/THE BRIDE ...Trix Are for kids. \nThis is something they used to say back when they fought alongside of each other as \"Vipers.\" \nThe seventeen Crazy 88 reinforcements come running into the restaurant and with drawn swords surround The Bride. \nAs a HEAVY METAL COMBAT BEAT begins to PULSATE ON THE SOUNDTRACK, The Boys and The Bride have a Spaghetti Western Stand-off. \nWe do a 360 INSIDE the CIRCLE of The Crazy 88, who surround the yellow-haired warrior. Not all have Samurai swords; one JUGGLES TWO HATCHETS, another TWIRLS A THREE-STAFF TRIPLE IRON over his head. \nAs the Heavy Metal music builds...We Cut to various Shots of The Two Opposing Forces Preparing to Strike....Hands on Sword Handles...Feet finding Combat Stance...etc... \n....Until Heavy Metal reaches its Breaking Point... \n...At that point, the Metal EXPLODES OVER THE SOUNDTRACK...IN TIME WITH The BRIDE EXPLODING INTO A VIOLENT KILLING MACHINE ON SCREEN. \nAs she matches skill with the army of black-suited boys, arms flailing, silver blade Clashing and Slashing, long blonde hair whipping like a whirling dervish.... ...She's a Goddess of War Venus. \nNot only is the FIGHT CUT TO THE HEAVY METAL MUSIC, but The Bride seems to be somewhat dancing to it as she fights. \nThis explosion of furious violence is punctuated CINEMATICALLY BY THE COLOR IN THE FILM POPPING OFF, and the fight being filmed in HIGH CONTRAST BLACK AND WHITE, turning the squirting, spewing geysers of BLOOD FROM CRIMSON RED TO OIL BLACK. \nMany members of The Crazy 88 are Sliced, Slashed, and liberated from the limbs they were born with at The Bride's blade. \nSome SPECIFIC MOMENTS \nWhile Clashing swords, The Bride whips the silver Boomerang out of its holster, and Throws it... \n....It Twirls Through the Air... \n...Embedding itself longways in one of the boy's faces. \nThe Bride does a Mid-Air Somersault over the head of an Attacker, landing solid on her feet behind him...Slash, he's Out. \nThe Bride is knocked to the floor, her Attacker stands over her to Spear the young blonde, Her Legs Spring Up In The Air, Ankles Lock Around The Boy's Neck. \nShe throws him down to the ground. With his neck still in the vise-like grip of her ankles, She removes The SOG Knife from its sheath and Plunges it Deep Into The Boy's Chest. \nWhile still on the ground, an Attacker Charges at her. Yanking the Boomerang out of the Dead Boy's Face, She Sends It Flying in the Charging Man's path... \n...Boomerang Twirling Through the Air Close to the Ground... \n...Chopping Off the Charging Attacker's Foot in Mid Step, he falls flat. \nThe Bride jumps up onto an attacker's shoulders. She locks her legs around him so he's helpless at shaking her off. \n...she swings down with her sword, and cuts the man's hands off. \nSo while the helpless man with no hands screams, the now nine foot tall Bride fights with the others. \nWhen she's through she brings the blade across the man she's perched on's throat. He falls to his knees, bringing the Bride back to the floor like an alevator. \nAs soon as her soles touch ground, she's off his shoulders, somersaulting on the floor, bringing her blade up between an attacker's legs into his groin. \nHe lets out a scream, as she yanks her blade free. \nONE ATTACKER steps out from the rest, \"The Best One.\" He Twirls his sword expertly, challenging the young woman to, \"Come get a piece.\" \nThe Bride does a screaming charge towards him.... ...Sword raised, The Attacker stands his ground, calm - steady, waiting for the blonde-haired locomotive to \ncollide.....They meet..... \nSWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE - SWING - CLASH - SPIN - CLASH - LOCK - TWIRL - SEPARATE - \nThey match each other blow for blow, till one makes a mistake. It's the male. The Bride's swing, that's neither clashed or blocked, slices off his right arm. \n...The arm, still gripping the samurai sword, drops to the floor. \nThe Bride pushes the Hanzo Sword right through the middle of his chest. \nOnly half of the Crazy 88s that started the fight remain alive, or intact...They start to approach...The Bride, still holding the sword that's still impaling the skilled Attacker, backs up, keeping his body between her and the remaining killers. \nLike a boxer, The Bride uses the momentary break in the action, to rest on her feet.....THEN...yanks the blade from his chest cavity....The Body Twitches - Spasms - Grunts and Crashes to the floor. \nThe Attackers start to close in...The Bride readies herself for their attack....THEN (in perfect time with the Heavy Metal)...Drops to the floor on her back, Spinning like a top. She Swings and Slashes and Cuts down below at their legs and feet, like some hellish samurai sword-weilding turtle flipped over on its shell.... \nMany black-suited, mask-wearing boys drop to the ground. \n...Still Spinning like a break dancer, she spins up on top of her head, and Pops back up on her feet. \nAnd then there were seven. \nThe seven remaining sword-weilding, black-suited boys moved out of range of the Bride's blade when she dropped to the floor. Now spread out, they make a large half-circle. \nThe Bride, slowly points the tip of her blade to the floor, lowers herself to one knee and slightly bows her head. In repose. \nEX CU The Bride's eyes pointed up, watch them move closer, COLOR COMES BACK INTO THE FILM. We see her face is splashed with blood. \nO-REN WHIPS OPEN a red fan. \nGO GO stands by the restaurant's junction box, she flips the switch. \nThe room goes dark. \nThe Crazy 7 make a wide circle around the blonde who's still on the floor.... \n...Looking down on her breathing hard in the shadows. As she breathes in and out, The FACE OF A LIONESS IS SUPERIMPOSED OVER HER FACE. \nBreathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) - Breathe in (Bride) - Breathe out (Lioness) ..... \nThe Bride rises to her feet... \nThe Crazy 7 move in a circle around The Bride, she moves in a circle inside of their circle, all eight of them move in rhythm with the Metal... \nThe Heavy Metal Music builds....to a big finish...THEN both Music and The Bride Explode! \nWIDE SHOT - FRAMED LIKE A KABUKI STAGE With the lights off, The White paper wall the eight killers fight in front of turns a Psychedelic Bright Blue. The snow falling outside is reflected against the paper wall like black snow falling on a blue shadow puppet stage. \nThe eight samurais are Black Silhouettes against the blue backdrop. They begin to combat in a dance of blood, steel and death. The Bride does a sword-weilding dosey-doe with all sword-weilding partners. \nShe CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASHES with all of them - They seperate - stalk each other for a moment to the beat - then CLISH-CLASH-CLISH-CLASH again, with The Bride killing or hacking the limbs of one unlucky dance partner at each encounter - Sometimes during the separation, The Bride crouches down low in repose while the others continue to circle stalk...THEN...She Strikes again. \nWe Cut in closer whenever we need to. \nO-REN ISHII Screams at her \"...last line of defense;\" \nO-REN (ENGLISH) What are you waiting for? Are you on a date? Attack her you fool! \nTHE BRIDE Oh my God... (pause) ...She just called you a fool. She just called you a fool in front of me. Not only am I your opponent. I'm a female fellow countryman. And you're going to risk your life - to say nothing of harming me - for a woman who refers to you as a fool? \nO-REN is furious, and slaps Mr. Barrel on the shoulder. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Attack, Goddamn you! \nThe Bride acts like she's embarrassed to witness what she just saw. \nMr. Barrel spins in O-Ren's direction shooting her a look she's never seen from him before. \nHe then looks back to the Bride. \nHer eyes are waiting for his. She says with just the slightest hint of plea in her voice; \nTHE BRIDE I'll owe ya one. \nHe looks at her a BEAT longer...then says as he resheaths his sword; \nMR. BARREL The things I do for a pretty face. \nINSERT: The Blade sliding back down into the Sheath, The Handle locks into place with a Click. \nHe looks back over his shoulder at his former Mistress, and says; \nMR. BARREL (JAPANESE) I quit. \nO-Ren fries and egg on her head. \nThen   with his sheathed Sword    in his right hand, and his left hand   in his pants pocket, he    walks across the carnage-strewn room   and out the front door.    As he walks, when he's parallel with   the Bride, He stops and    says; \nMR. BARREL About that one you owe me. \nTHE BRIDE Yes? \nMR. BARREL I'm gonna collect someday, you know? \nTHE BRIDE I'll be disappointed if you don't. \nHe continues walking without a look back. Before he Exits the restaurant, he throws a look in Sofie's direction, Who's lying minus her arm in a pool of her own blood, and says; \nMR. BARREL Tough luck bout that arm Sofe. \nHe exits the Movie. \nO-REN and The BRIDE match eyes. The Japanese gal says; \nO-REN (ENGLISH) Very funny. (pause) Your instrument is quite impressive. \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Domo. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Where was it made? \nTHE BRIDE Okinawa. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Whom in Okinawa made you this steel? \nTHE BRIDE This is Hattori Hanzo steel. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) YOU LIE!! \nThe Bride just smiles at her rival's response. \nO-Ren's composure returns. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Swords however never get tired. I hope you've saved your energy. If you haven't, you might not last five minutes. (pause) \nHave you seen the garden in this establishment? \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) No. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) Oh, you really should. It's quite beautiful. Allow me. \nO-Ren moves out of the position she's stood in for the entire battle. She steps on the doormat of a corpse, that serves the same purpose of a bottom step, and moves over to the white paper wall and slides it open....REVEALING.... \n.....A WHITE WINTER WONDERLAND, set against a Jet Black sky. A Snow-covered Japanese Garden awaits right outside. Snow falls from the sky (Slightly artificial, not phony - but Operatic/Theatrical). O-Ren stands next to the Bride in the doorway looking out into the white night. \nO-REN (JAPANESE) As last looks go, you could do worse. \nThe Queen of the Tokyo Underworld steps outside... \nThe Bride follows her... \nINT. SNOW-COVERED JAPANESE GARDEN - NIGHT \nAs snow falls around them, they stand the correct distance from one another. \nCOMBAT MUSIC BEGINS PLAYING, but not Japanese drums - Spanish Flamenco Guitar....... \nThe Bride Unsheaths her Sword Quickly...Holding it out in front of her...Tip of Blade pointed at O-Ren...Sword's Handle and her Fingers wrapped around that handle, up by her cheek...Her eyes are Reflected on the Blade...Snow falls around her. \nO-Ren begins walking forward towards the Bride...She raises up her Sword, still in its sheath, in front of her face vertically...then begins slowly unsheathing it...Snow falls around her. \nO-REN'S FEET White socks in wooden clogs, walk forward, Crunching Snow underneath them... \nThe BRIDE Holding Sword...Eyes reflected in Blade...her Yellow Sneakers Crunching snow underneath them... \nO-REN when her Sword is fully unsheathed, the Japanese combat artist holds both arms straight out at her sides, Sword in one hand - Wood sheath in the other, like a bird.... \n....The Two Women circle each other.... \nThey SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE...CIRCLE...SWING - CLASH - DANCE - SEPARATE... \nO-REN LEAPS in the air does a Somersault over the Bride's head, landing behind her opponent. She brings her Sword down in a Slashing Swing... \nSLASHING The BRIDE across her back - Spinning her around... \nO-Ren goes in for the kill...The Bride meets her blade... The Blades Clash and Lock...The Two Women's faces come together as the Blades become entangled... \nO-Ren moves her arm in a counter-clockwise motion that loosens the grip enough to bring her sword handle hard into The Bride's mouth... \nKnocking her backwards over a small, stone bench - Flat on her ass in a koi pond. \n- The Combat Guitar Stops - \nO-Ren doesn't charge the fallen blonde, She laughs; \nO-REN (ENGLISH) Silly Caucasian girl likes to play with samurai swords. Bill might of humored you, but you will find neither humor nor mercy at my blade. Now unless you intend to commit sepeku among the koi, stand up and fight. You may not be able to fight like a samurai, but you can at least die like a samurai. \nThe Combat Guitar starts again...As The Bride slowly rises out of the koi pond. She brings up her sword and Says Calmly to O-Ren in Japanese; \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Attack me. With everything you have. \nThe Two Women Clash Swords furiously, their attack ends with \nThe Bride's Striking O-Ren - not fatally - but deep. They separate... \n...breathing hard...Cold Air coming out of their mouths like two locomotives... \nO-Ren looks down to her wound, then back up to The Bride. The respect for the Bride's ability is transparent. \nThe Two Women Circle Stalk each other again... \nRed Blood running down Yellow Legs onto Yellow Sneakers... \nWooden Clogs crunching the Snow, Blood trail dripping down legs staining White Socks with Red... \nThey Attack, the Geisha figurine and The tall western girl with the mane of Whipping Blonde Hair. They Swing - Twist - Turn - Clash, matching blow for blow till they both back off. \nBoth Women are out of breath and have    to stop to recuperate. As they both drink the harsh cold air    into their lungs, leaving red blood stains in the white    snow, the two females have the same thought. The next clash    will be their last. \nTWO SHOT YUKI AND BUSINESS SUIT Yuki focused, Business Suit penetrated...She opens him up more...he feels every inch of the blade's progress. \nYUKI (JAPANESE) How bout now, big boy, do you still wish to penetrate me... \nBlade cuts deeper... \nYUKI (JAPANESE) Or is it I who has penetrated you. \nAnd with her last line, does the final disemboweling slice that sends his insides spilling out onto the barroom floor. \nBACK TO SOFIE \nSOFIE (JAPANESE) When she stops shedding tears, she'll start shedding blood. \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Best guess, what will she do? \nSOFIE (JAPANESE) I don't hafta guess, she'll come after you. \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Will she ever give up? \nSOFIE (JAPANESE) She won't have to. When she finds \nyou, I don't know who will win. But what I do know is, she will find you. \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Is she more skilled than I? \nSOFIE (JAPANESE) Skilled won't be the word. \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Don't be coy with me, bitch. What would be the word? \nSOFIE Crazy. \nThe Bride takes this in...then moves on. \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) Okay, now I want all the information on the Deadly Vipers,... What they've been doing and where I can find them. \nEXT. TOKYO GENERAL HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nThe big hospital of TOKYO is located by a hill by the highway. Sofie's MAZDA pulls off the highway to the side. \nThe Bride hops out of the car, runs to the back, opens the trunk, takes out Sofie's body, and rolls it down the hill....Sofie stops rolling in front of the entrance of the huge hospital. \nCUT TO: \nCU SOFIE in a hospital environment. Bill's voice speaks to her OFF SCREEN; \nBILL (O.S.; ENGLISH) Sofie, Sofie, my Sofie, I'm so sorry. \nSOFIE (ENGLISH) Please forgive my betrayal -- \nHe shhhh's her off screen; \nBILL (O.S.; ENGLISH) -- no more of that. I invented that truth serum. Once it entered your bloodstream, you no longer had a choice. \nSOFIE (ENGLISH) But, still -- \nBILL (O.S.; ENGLISH) -- But still -- nothing, except my aching heart over what she's done to my beautiful and brilliant Sofie. (pause) If you had to guess why she left you alive, what would be your guess? \nSOFIE (ENGLISH) Guessing won't be necessary. She informed me. \nBACK TO THE BRIDE AT THE TRUNK \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) I'm allowing you to keep your wicked life for one reason and one reason only. So you can tell him, in person, everything that happened here tonight. I want him to witness the extent of my mercy..., by witnessing your deformed body. I want you to tell him, all the information you just told me. I want him to know what I know. I want him to know I want him to know. \nThen with SUPERMAN X-RAY VISION we see through the helmet to the Bride's face inside as she says the last line. \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) And I want them all to know, they'll all soon be as dead as O REN. \nWE CUT TO A \nCU of SOFIE WE PAN to a CU of YUKI \nBill says off screen; \nBILL (O.S.; JAPANESE) If O-Ren was number one, unless she's being tricky, Vernita Green will be number two. \nYUKI (JAPANESE) Where is Vernita Green? \nBILL (O.S., JAPANESE) Los Angeles.

The sleeping giant is awake, and in her eyes we see she's filled with a terrible resolve. \nAs Hanzo sews, he recites in Japanese the Yagu mantra, the Bride recites in Japanese after him. \nEX CU: O-REN ISHII'S name written in the Bride's notebook with the number one next to it.

Open the door Alburt, let's see what this Bill looks like. \nThe door opens revealing BILL to the other side of the door, and for the first time, to the audience. He looks cool. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nBill looks inside and sees a fancy hotel room converted into a crap game. A crap table has been erected in the middle of the suite. SEVEN MEN stand around the table trying their luck. All playing has stopped at the opening of the door. \nOne woman in a beautiful black dress, stands at the head of the table...It's her game...her name is L.F. O'BOYLE. \nBill stands in the doorway. ALBURT the doorman, who wears a \ntux, waits for L.F.'s word. \nL.F. O'BOYLE Are you a policeman, Bill? \nBILL Not anymore? \nL.F. laughs. \nL.F. Let him play, Alburt. \nBill steps inside and the game continues in earnest. \nL.F. (to the players) We now return to the game already in progress. The point is nine gentlemen, nine is the point... \nAs Alburt    frisks him, Bill takes in the room. There are five other men    all wearing black tuxedos, all carrying samurai swords (as    is Alburt), all working for Miss O'Boyle. In his hand Bill    holds his sheathed Hanzo sword. Referring to the sword; \nALBURT I'll take that. \nBILL You'll have to. \nThe two men stare... \nL.F. Now now boys...Mr. Bill, do you intend to start any shit with that sword? \nBILL I give you my word of honor, I will start nothing. \nL.F. Good enough for me. (back to game) \nALBURT Miss O'Boyle required a two-hundred dollar membership fee. \nBILL That's rather pricey. \nALBURT You wanna play for free, go to Vegas. You start now you'll be there by sundown. \nBill takes out a roll of bills that would choke a rodeo bull to death. He peels off two hundred. \nBILL I think I'll stay here. I'm thirsty. \nALBURT That way. \nBill walks over to the suite's bar, a YOUNG WOMAN tends it. \nBILL Beer. \nBARTENDER Twenty dollars. \nBILL Twenty dollars for a beer? \nBARTENDER High cost of living shooter. You don't like it, go to Vegas. You can \nget a prime rib dinner there for \nBILL What am I going to do, I'm thirsty. (throws a 20 on the bar) Pour the beer. \nThe Bartender produces a dixie cup, and a can of Budweiser. She pops the top and fills the cup, leaving half of the beer inside the can. She then offers only the cup to Bill. \nBILL (pointing to the can) I don't get that? \nThe Bartender slowly shakes her head, no. \nHe lifts the dixie cup to his lips, and says; \nBILL Cheers. \nBill approaches the table with his dixie cup of beer. \nL.F. Gentlemen, let's    see if the new kid in school wants    to play right away. (to Bill) How bout it new    kid, you wanna handle my bones,    or do you just like to watch? \nDropping his money roll on the table... \nBILL I came to play. \nColor L.F. impressed. \nL.F. Boys take a look at this man, he's what Webster's calls, a gambler. The dice belong to you , sir. \nWith her table stick, she pushes the dice to Bill. He takes them and inspects them. \nL.F. I hope you're not implying anything, friend? \nBILL (as he inspects dice) I'm not implying anything. \nAlburt starts to move from his position by the door. \nALBURT That did it fuckhead, you're out the door -- \nL.F. motions him back to his position. \nThe players watch L.F. And Bill, an opposite ends of the table, trade quips. \nBill looks from the dice to L.F. \nBILL You looked me over when I stood in your doorway. I'm looking you over as I step up to your table. If I don't know, I don't throw. \nL.F. Are you satisfied? \nBILL More or less. \nL.F. I think we're getting into a antagonistic relationship. \nBILL Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were trying to take my money, and I was trying to take yours. \nL.F. It's just a game. \nBill throws ten thousand dollars on the table, the room reacts. \nBILL If you're game, take my bet sportsman. \nL.F. Covered. \nBill smiles as he rolls the dice in his hand, then throws...7...The room reacts...L.F. smiles and pushes the money and the dice back to Bill with her stick. He picks up his winnings, tosses them back on the table, and says; \nBILL Shoot it all. \nThe room reacts. \nL.F. Covered. \nHe holds the dice in his fist...and throws...5... \nL.F. The point is five, gentlemen, five is the point. \nBill throws...5...more reaction...more money... \nBILL Shoot it all. \nL.F. Covered. \nHe shoots again, he wins again... \nL.F. O'Boyle hides in her room, holding a gun, pointed at the front door. \nShe sits in bushwhack mode, waiting for Bill, or anybody for that matter, to step through the doorway. \nWHEN... \nThe window her back is up against SHATTERS, and a black gloved hand reaches inside and GRABS her by her hair, and YANKS her out the window. \nEXT. HOTEL WINDOW LEDGE - NIGHT \nBill on the ledge of the hotel window (the 26th floor), outside L.F. O'Boyle's room. \nHe's yanked her outside and he's dangling her over the side by her hair. \nBILL Do you know a Jessica? \nL.F. Is too hysterical to answer. \nBILL Well, she knows you. \nHe drops her...... \n............... SHE FALLS.... \n...................................SHE SPLATS. \nBill watches her all the way down. When he's confident her fall was fatal, he leaves the ledge. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nBLACK FRAME TITLE CARD: \nChapter seven \n\"The lonely grave of Paula Schultz\" \nEXT. BUDD'S TRAILER - DAY \nA small camper trailer sits all by its lonesome in the middle of a barren Texas wasteland. \nA SUBTITLE APPEARS under this image; \n\"The city of Austin Texas.\" \nA fist knocks on the trailer door. \nIt opens, revealing    Bill's    brother, BUDD. Not the Slick Willie Budd with the    black    suit and the silver-tipped black cowboy boots we saw    earlier    at the wedding chapel massacre. No, the Budd we see    now is    the Budd who climbed into a bottle five years ago, got    himself    comfortable, and decided to live there. \nBill, looking like    a cool million, stands out in the dirt and dust of Budd's lot    of land, looking up at his brother in his natural habitat. In    the B.G. we can see Elle Driver lounging in the passenger's    seat. \nBudd, surprised by the visitor, says; \nBUDD Great day in the morning. Brother Bill livin up to his familia obligation. \nBILL How ya doin' Budd? \nBUDD Oh, you know my life, Bill, just a mad rush of wild parties and wealthy women. \nBudd squints into the sun at the woman in Bill's ear. \nBUDD Is that that tall blonde one-eyed Viking bitch in the passenger seat? \nBILL It's Elle. Want to say hello? \nBUDD Never said \"bye,\" can't seem to think of a reason to say, \"hi.\" \nINSERT: INT. - BILL'S CAR \nElle inside, blasting both the stereo and the air conditioner. She watches the brotherly scene play out through the car windshield. Obviously there's no love lost between Elle and Budd. \nBUDD What'd ya wanna talk about? \nBILL Are you not going to invite me in? \nBUDD No. \nBILL May I ask why not? \nBUDD It stinks in there, that's why. Now what's so important it requires a reunion? \nTIME CUT \nThe estranged brothers continue their conversation. Budd sits in the doorway of his trailer, bottle of jack in his hand. Bill stands. \nBUDD You tryin to tell me she cut her way through eighty-eight bodyguards 'fore she got to O-Ren? \nBILL No. There wasn't really eighty eight of them, they just called themselves The Crazy 88. \nBUDD Why. \nBILL \nI dunno, I guess they thought it sounded cool. Anyhow, she had about 26 or 27 around her when (BLEEP) attacked. They all fell under her Hanzo sword. \nThe mention of a Hattori Hanzo sword gets Budd's attention. \nBUDD She got 'er a Hattori Hanzo sword? \nBill nods his head, \"yes.\" \nBILL She has a Hanzo Jingi sword. \nBUDD He made her one? Didn't he swear a blood oath never to make another sword? \nBILL It would appear he's broken it. \nBudd doesn't say anything at first...THEN; \nBUDD Them Japs know how to carry a grudge don't they? Or is it just you tend to bring that out in people? \nBILL (pause) I know this is a ridiculous question before I ask, but you by any chance haven't kept up with your swordplay? \nBUDD Hell, I pawned that years ago. \nBILL You pawned a Hattori Hanzo sword? \nBUDD Yep. \nThe disrespect is pain. \nBILL It was priceless. \nBUDD Not in El Paso it ain't. In El Pso I got me 250 Dollars for it. \nBILL Since it was a gift from me, why didn't you offer me the chance to buy it back? \nBUDD Because that would've required me to acknowledge your existence. Drunken bum though I may be, I don't need booze that bad. But who the hell gives a crap anyway. That bitch ain't gittin no Bushido points for killin a white trash piece of shit like me with a samurai sword. I'm a bouncer in a titty bar, Bill. If she wants to fight me, all she gotta do is come down to the Club, start some shit, and we'll be in a a fight. \nBILL -- Budd, you need to listen to me. I know we haven't spoken for quite some time, and the last time we spoke wasn't the most pleasant. But you need to get over being mad at me, and start becoming afraid of Bea. Because she is coming, and she's coming to kill you. And unless you accept my assistance, I have no doubt she will succeed. \nBudd sees Bill's true concern for his welfare. \nBill tries to charm his brother. \nBILL Can't we forget the past, and look at the happy side of all this? \nBudd chuckles. \nBUDD And what would that happy side be? \nBILL She's brought \"the boys\" back together. \nBudd is touched by Bill's concern and chuckles to himself. \nThe BRIDE standing in the doorway is HIT SMACK DAB in the chest, and PROPELLED THROUGH the AIR BACKWARDS. \nLanding hard on her back in the dirt. \nBudd casually rises from his rocking chair and lifts the needle off the phonograph, cutting off the music. \nThen with shotgun in hand, stands in the doorway of the trailer looking down at The Bride. \nBUDD'S POV: The Bride laid out in the dirt below him -- Sword separated from her grasp -- Bloody mess down her front -- Groan from her throat. \nBudd steps down from the trailer onto the dirt, standing over The Bride. \nBUDD Bet your sweet ass that don't sting like a bitch. \nMore groans coming out of The blood splattered Bride. \nBUDD \nYou done got a double dose of rock salt, right in the ole tit. Now not havin tits as fine or as big as yours, I can't even imagine how bad that shit stings... \nHe lowers down on his haunchers, over her. \nBUDD ...But I don't wont to neather. \nThe Bride, hurting and incapacitated from the shotgun blast, still nevertheless defiant, SPITS a gob of bloody saliva, right in ole Budd's face. \nBudd, gob of spit running down on his cheek and nose. The cowboy removes a red bandana from his back pocket, and wipes away the goo. Then his eyeballs go down to the spitter. \nBUDD Now I know when it    comes to a rock salt burn, you're    feelin pretty much like a expert    bout now. But truth be told, you    ain't felt all rock salt's got to    offer till you took a double dose    in your backside. \nWith the help of his cowboy boot he rolls The Bride over onto her stomach, exposing her butt. \nSNAPPING the barrel closed, he takes aim and FIRES both barrels -- EXECUTION STYLE -- right into her keister. \nThe Bride does the one thing she has yet to do with any opponent during the movie up till now. Her head rears back and she lets out a SCREAM! \nBUDD That gentled ya down, didn't it? Yep...ain't nobody a badass with two barrels of rock salt dug deep in their backyard. \nTHEN... \nAlmost mercifully, the man once known as \"Sidewinder,\" sticks a syringe in her arm, dropping her unconscious. \nTHEN... \nKnocking down a swig of Jack Daniels, he removes a small silver cell phone from his pants pocket, raises the antenna, and presses one button on the panel. \nINT. ELLE DRIVER'S GYM - NIGHT \nThe six-foot tall, long-haired blonde with the codename \"California Mountain Snake,\" is doing a savage boxing workout with her COACH. \nThis is one white bitch who can kick some serious FUCKIN ass. With one mighty blow from her huge right arm (synched to the sound of a CAR CRASH), her boxing Coach buys the farm. \nElle on cell phone. We cut Back and Forth. \nELLE Bill? \nBUDD Wrong brother, you hateful bitch. \nELLE ....Budd? \nBUDD Bingo. \nELLE And what do I owe this dubious pleasure? \nBUDD I just caught me the cowgirl, ain't never been caught. \nThis gets Elle's attention. \nELLE Do you mean what I think you mean? \nBUDD If you think I mean I got 'er, you thought right. \nELLE Did you kill her? \nBUDD Not yet I ain't. But I can sure do it easy enough. She's so gentle right now, I could preform her coup de grace with a rock. \nELLE What are you waiting for, run outta liquid courage. \nBUDD No. It's just...I ain't killed nobody in a long Goddamn time. And just 'tween you, me, and Jesus Christ, kinda made me a promise I wasn't gonna. Be that however it is. Back when I did kill people...I got paid for it. Just don't seem right...turn amateur this time of life. \nWe stay on Elle's side for the following exchange. \nBUDD (O.S.) Anywho, guess what I'm holdin in my hand right now. \nWe cut back to Budd's side. And what he's holding is The Bride's Hattori Hanzo sword. \nBUDD A brand spankin new Hattori Hanzo sword. And I'm here to tell ya Elle, that's what I call sharp. \nELLE How much? \nBUDD Oh, that's hard to say. Seein it's priceless and all. \nELLE I'll give you a hundred thousand dollars for it. \nBUDD I'm sure you would. But I'll take, one million. \nELLE Jeez Budd, who'd ever guess you were such a capitalist. I thought drunks like yourself were beyond such monetary concerns? \nBUDD Well Elle, a million dollars buys a whole lotta Jack. \nELLE Why then are you selling it to a hateful bitch like me, when you know Bill would pay more? \nBUDD If I'm gonna drink myself to death, ...it won't be on Bill's dollar. It's gonna be on yours. \nELLE What's the terms? \nBUDD You buy a ticket to Texas, and I'll see you here tomorrow mornin. You give me a million in foldin cash, I'll give you the greatest sword ever made by a man. How's that sound? \nELLE Sounds like we got a deal. One \ncondition. \nBUDD What? \nELLE You kill her tonight. (pause) And one more thing. \nBUDD You said one condition. \nELLE It's a caveat to the same condition. \nBUDD What? \nELLE She must suffer to her last breath. \nBUDD That Elle darlin, I can pretty damwell guarantee. \nELLE Then I'll see you in the morning millionaire. \nCUT TO: \nOVERHEAD SHOT - EXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT \nWe look down on a spooky Texas graveyard... Tombstones...Graves...Dirt...Low-hanging fog. This could be the opening shot of a Texas zombie movie. We also see TWO MEN WITH SHOVELS (one which is Budd, the other which is ERNIE) digging up a grave. Budd's beat-to-shit pickup is in the shot too. Its headlight beams shining on the two men. And last but not least, The Bride, bound and gagged, lying in the flatbed \nof Budd's pickup. \nThe BRIDE She begins to come to from the shot in her arm. Some dried blood lies caked around her wounds. Rope binds her wrists tightly together in front of her. \nA big leather cowboy belt is wrapped tight around her cherry brown cowboy boots. Her eyelids flutter open...and she sees stars. A giant, black Texas night sky full of them. \nShe has no idea where she is. \nShe turns her head to the left and sees, \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) That's a lot better. But you're still too agitated. Can you hear your heart? It's like I'm buried alive with Buddy Rich. Turn off that flashlight. \nFear comes into her voice as she combats herself. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) No! I can't turn off the light. Yes you can. The darkness will have a calming effect. Now turn off that fucking light. \nShe does. The screen goes Jet Black \nEXT. CEMETERY - NIGHT \nBudd and Ernie are finished filling the grave. The old coffin, with the body of Paula Schultz, in the back of the flatbed. Before they climb into the truck and drive away, Budd lays a dozen red roses on The Bride's grave. \nINT. BUDD'S TRAILER (MOVING) - NIGHT \nBudd behind the wheel. Ernie in the passenger's seat. Car radio playing Mexican music. Budd's silver cell phone rings. \nBUDD (into phone) Yellow? \nINT. AIRPLANE (FLYING) - NIGHT \nElle Driver sits in a seat on a passenger jet enroute to the great state of Texas. She calls Budd on the airplane phone. \nELLE Didja do it? \nBUDD Elle darlin, she's sufferin as we speak. \nA smile spreads across Elle's face. She rests her head back against the seat's headrest. Her eyelids close. She slightly parts her lips...and lets out a; \n\"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh\" \nThis is the face of satisfaction. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nBLACK FRAME TITLE APPEARS: \nChapter eight \n\"The cruel tutelage of Pai Mei\" \nFADE UP ON \nEXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - CHINA - DAY \nWe see a beautiful mountain range in the middle of China. A SUBTITLE APPEARS UNDERNEATH: \n\"SMACK DAB IN THE MIDDLE OF CHINA\" \nA VOICE OVER SPOKEN BY BILL, tells us a story over this landscape; \nBILL (V.O.) Once upon a time in China, some believe around the year, one-double knot-three. \nAs Bill tells this story, it will be illustrated On Screen by footage from Old Shaw Brothers Martial arts flicks of the 70's. Especially Films that feature Chinese Actor LO LIEH as the old, white-haired, white-eyebrowed Villian \"PAI MEI.\" \nBILL (V.O.; CONT'D) ...head priest of The White Lotus Clan, Pai Mei, was walking down the road, contemplating whatever a man with Pai Mei's infinite power would contemplate -- Which is another way of saying, who knows. When, a Shaolin monk appeared on the road traveling in the opposite direction. As the monk and the priest crossed paths...Pai Mei -- in a practically unfathomable display of generosity, gave the monk the slightest of nods. The nod, was not returned. Was it the intention of the Shaolin monk to insult Pai Mei? Or, did he just fail to see the generous social gesture? The motives of the monk, remain, unknown. What is known, were the consequences. The next morning Pai Mei appeared at the Shaolin Temple, and demanded that the temple's head Abbot offer Pai Mei his neck, to repay the insult. The Abbot, at first, tried to console Pai Mei, only to find, Pai Mei was inconsolable. So began, the massacre of the Shaolin Temple, and all sixty of the monks inside, at the fists of the White Lotus. And so began, the legend of Pai Mei's Ten-Point Palm - Exploding Heart Technique. \nTHE BRIDE (V.O.) What praytell, is a ten-point palm - exploding heart technique? \nBILL (V.O.) Quite simply, the deadliest blow in all of the martial arts. He hits you with his fingertips, at ten different pressure points on your body. And then, he lets you walk away. But once you've taken five steps, your heart explodes inside your body, and you fall to the floor dead. \nWe see on screen Pai Mei demonstrate this technique on five shaolin monks. Who after being hit...take five steps...then \nfall to the floor dead. \nEXT. JEEP (MOVING) - DAY \nBill and The Bride, years earlier, driving in a jeep through the mountains of China, enroute to PAI MEI's. \nTHE BRIDE Did he teach you that? \nBILL No. He teaches no one the ten-point palm - exploding heart technique. But he is Nietzsche's psalm personified. If Pai Mei doesn't kill you, he will make you stronger. Now one of the things I always liked about you, Kiddo, is you appear wise beyond your years. Then allow me to impart, a word to the wise. Whatever - WHAT - EVER - Pai Mei says, Obey. If you flash him - even for an instant - a defiant eye, he'll pluck it out. And if you throw any American sass his way, he will snap your back and your neck like they were twigs, and that will be the story of you. \nEXT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE - DAY \nThe Bride sits in the jeep, by herself, parked in front of the Priest Pai Mei's home located high up on top of White Lotus Mountain. \nFor over 100 years, his home used to be the temple of the White Lotus Clan, and he was the temple's head priest. The temple served as a home to over 60 priests and disciples. But now - the year 1990 - the White Lotus Clan is no more. All the priests have died. All that remains, is a very old man, who once upon a time, some worshipped as a god and some feared as a devil...neither was wrong. \nA huge stone staircase of one hundred steps climb up a hill leading to Pei Mei's home. Bill climbs down to the jeep. \nBILL He'll accept you as his student. \nTHE BRIDE Caught him in a good mood, aye? \nBILL More like a sadistic one. \nShe climbs out, and gets her bag out of the back. \nBill casts a glance at the stone steps he just decended. \nBILL Just seeing those steps again makes me ache. You're gonna have plenty of fun carrying buckets of water up and down that fucker. \nTHE BRIDE Why did he accept me? \nBILL Because he's a very very very old man. And like all rotten bastards, when they get old, they become lonely. Not that that has any effect on their disposition. But they do learn the value of company. \nTHE BRIDE When will I see you again? \nBILL That's the title of my favorite soul song of the Seventies. \nTHE BRIDE What? \nBILL Nothing. When he tells me you're done. \nTHE BRIDE When do you think that might be? \nBILL That my dearest, all depends on you. Now remember, no backtalk, no sarcasm. Least not for the first year. You're going to have to let him warm up for you. He hates Caucasians, despises Americans, and has nothing but contempt for women, so in your case, that may take a little while. Adios. \nZOOM... \nThe jeep speeds off down the road...leaving the Bride all alone, somewhere in the middle of China. \nShe begins the journey before her by ascending the 100 steps to Pai Mei. \nINT. THE WHITE LOTUS TEMPLE \nThe huge temple is exactly like it must have been a hundred years ago, except now it's empty and dusty. \nThe Bride enters, She's winded from climbing up those fuckin steps. \nTHE BRIDE (yelling) Hello! \nHer Voice ECHOES in the cavernous temple. \nPAI MEI's VOICE ECHOES back; \nPAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.) Up the stairs, yankee woman! \nA beautiful (but dusty) Mahagony staircase leads to Pai Mei's private chamber. \nTHE BRIDE (to herself) More stairs, Jesus Christ. \nThe still unseen Man's voice BOOMS back; \nPAI MEI'S VOICE (O.S.) If it is Christ you seek, turn back now. \nShe climbs the wooden staircase. \nINT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE CHAMBER \nPAI MEI'S POV: We see through Pei Mei's pupils, through a sheer scarlet scrim that hangs down in front of his sitting area. The Bride enters the room. \nShe approaches the old man, reaches the edge of his sitting area in front of the scrim, lowers to one knee and bows her head. \nAnd AGAIN... \nA crack in the lid... \nAGAIN... \nDirt begins to sift through the cracks onto the Bride... \nAGAIN... \nMore dirt... \nAGAIN... \nEven more dirt... \nAGAIN... \nTHE LID SMASHES and dirt pours into the coffin like water... \nTHEN... \nThrough six feet of dirt, we watch, the Bride - DIG - CLIMB - SWIM - SPROUT - BURROW - trough the earth like a sprouting plant and a burrowing mole combined, clawing for surface air. \nEXT. PAULA SCHULTZ'S GRAVE - NIGHT \nA SHOT straight out of an Italian horror film. We see the \ntombstone of \"PAULA SCHULTZ,\" and the mound of dirt over her grave. \nWHEN... \nThe Bride's hand breaks the surface...then like one of Fulci's Zombies, Claws, Digs, and Pulls herself from mother earth's womb. \nOnce extracted from her (almost) final resting place, she rolls over on her back, exhausted. She drinks in the night's air as if it were gulps of water. \nDIRT is in, on, and under every crack, crevice, and wrinkle on her body. \nSHE looks like a beautiful sculpture, made out of dirt. \nINT. DINER - NIGHT \nA Texas diner across the street from the graveyard. A YOUNG SODA JERK stands behind the counter, waiting for a customer, when he sees something approaching through the restaurant's big picture window that makes him look twice. \nSODA JERK'S POV: Through the picture window, we see the Bride, emerge from the Texas night, and walk towards the diner looking for all the world like a six-foot tall female version of the Peanuts character \"PIG PEN.\" With each of her footfalls, a smaller mushroom cloud of dust comes off her. \nThe dirty blonde, walks into the diner, sits on a stool at the counter directly across from the Soda Jerk, and says; \nTHE BRIDE I'd like a glass of water. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nBLACK FRAME TITLE CARD: \nChapter nine \n\"ELLE and I\" \nCUT TO: \nCU ELLE DRIVER Behind the wheel of a hot black and gold Trans Am, driving full out on top of the desert's surface.

She shuts off the car and the radio. \nThe camper door opens, Budd squints outside through the bright gold, hot desert morning, at the Tall Blonde Girl with one Good Eye. \nBUDD Want some breakfast? \nINT. BUDD'S CAMPER'S KITCHEN - DAY \nBudd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as he finishes telling the tale of last night. \nELLE ...So that's called a Texas funeral? \nBUDD Yep. \nELLE I got to give it to ya Budd, that's a pretty fucked up way to die. What's the name on the grave she's buried under? \nBUDD Paula Schultz. \nBudd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the    name Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and    sees the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off. \nELLE \nCan I look at the sword? \nBUDD That's my money in that black case, isn't it? \nELLE Sure is. \nBUDD Well then, it's your sword now. \nThe tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair. \nShe slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath. \nELLE So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword. \nBudd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars with breakfast margaritas. \nBUDD That's a Hanzo sword alright. \nELLE Bill tells me you once had one of your own. \nPause. \nBUDD Once. \nELLE How does this one compare to that one? \nBUDD If you're gonna compare a Hanzo sword, you compare it to every \nsword ever made -- wasn't made by Hattori Hanzo. Here, wrap your lips around this. \nHe hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. He takes a gulp. \nBUDD So, which \"R\" you filled with? \nELLE What? \nBUDD They say the number one killer of old people is retirement. People got'em a job to do, they tend to live a little longer so they can do it. I've always figured warriors and their enemies share the same relationship. So now you ain't gonna hafta face your enemy on the battlefield no more, which \"R\" are you filled with, Relief or Regret? \nELLE A little bit of both. \nBUDD Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both. But I know damn well you feel one more than you feel the other. The question was which one? \nElle looks right at him with her eye, and says; \nELLE Regret. \nBUDD Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol' girl. I never saw nobody buffalo Bill the way she buffaloed Bill. Bill useta think she was so damn smart. I tried to tell him... Bill, she's just smart for a blonde. \nHe looks over at Elle and grins. \nElle looks at him. \nELLE Want your money? \nShe gestures to the black suitcase by her feet. \nThe camper door swings open. The Bride emerges from Budd's home, looking like a Barbie doll that's been dug up after ten years buried in the backyard, carrying a Hanzo sword. Every footfall creating a cloud of dust. \nThe two women, each carrying a samurai sword, face each other in showdown position. \nA shark smile spreads across Elle's face. \nELLE Bravo, Bea. I actually thought that alacky had got the best of you. \nTHE BRIDE You thought wrong. \nThe Bride unsheaths her sword with great flourish. \nElle does the same. \nELLE (referring to the sword) What's that? \nTHE BRIDE Budd's Hanzo sword. \nELLE He said he pawned it. \nTHE BRIDE Guess that makes him a liar, don't it? \nWithout raising their swords into position, the two blonde warriors circle each other. \nTHE BRIDE (question) Elle? \nELLE (answer) Bea. \nTHE BRIDE I was wondering, just 'tween us girls, what did you say to Pai Mei for him to snatch out your eye? \nFLASHBACK - SPAGHETTI WESTERN STYLE of Pai Mei SNATCHING out Elle's eye with his Eagle's Claw. \nELLE I called him a bastard. \nTHE BRIDE Oooh, not so good. \nELLE Were I to do it over again, I'd bite my tongue. \nTHE BRIDE One more question? \nELLE Shoot. \nTHE BRIDE Where's Bill? \nELLE Villa Quatro. \nTHE BRIDE Gulf of Mexico? \nElle nods her head 'yes.' \nTHE BRIDE You wouldn't lie to me now? \nELLE Why lie? \nElle raises up The Bride's Hanzo sword into position. \nThe Bride raises up her sword. \nTHE BRIDE I saw what you did to that little Mamba in there. Want to try that on somebody your own size? \nELLE I intend to. \nThe Bride completely drops her sword stance and her samurai bearing. \nTHE BRIDE Oh    Elle,   I    should warn   you    before we get started. Hattori Hanzo swords are extremely sharp. They can    take   a    little   getting    used   to. Careful not to cut your own arm off. \nELLE I don't rattle, bitch! \nThe Bride brings her sword back into combat position. \nTHE BRIDE You're gonna bleed though, you're gonna bleed a lot. \nTHEN... \nSPAGHETTI WESTERN MUSIC EXPLODES ON THE SOUNDTRACK. \nThe two blonde warriors....swords in position...no longer circle each other....but instead move forward...closer and closer to each other....one baby step at a time... \nCU OF GIRLS. \nEX CU'S OF: \nTheir separate GRIPS on the SWORD'S HANDLE. \nTheir FEET moving closer. \nThe Bride's eye. \nElle's eye. \nThe Tips of each other's Blade. \nTheir Blonde Hair. \nAs the Operatic Spaghetti Western Music Builds to a crescendo...we CUT BACK AND FORTH between CU's of the two women that get TIGHTER AND TIGHTER as we ZOOM in CLOSER and CLOSER....UNTIL...We reach the THEME'S CLIMAX.... \nBoth women let loose with a    Samurai Grunt and Swing. \nEX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH. \nEX CU: BLONDE HAIR WHIPPING. \nEX CU: TWO SILVER BLADES CLASH AGAIN. \nTWO SHOT: The TWO WOMEN WARRIORS stand their ground, STRIKING and DEFENDING...When they stop, no one's been touched. \nThe TWO WOMEN - Swords in attack position - stare across to the other one, as they prepare for their next attack... \nNow they begin to circle again. \nCU THEIR FEET making a circular walk. \nThey ATTACK... \nEX CU BLADES MEET -- However this time we don't know who's on the left or the right. One Blade maneuvers around the other. \nEX EX CU: of TIP OF BLADE SLICING OPEN SKIN, about a quarter of an inch. It looks like a scalpel cut. No blood. Just skin separating. We don't know who's cut. \nThe TWO WOMEN stand and face each other. Neither knows if it's them who has been struck. Neither woman bleeds. \nWe feel a count of...One Mississippi... \nEX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE, clean as a whistle. \nEX CU: ONE SILVER BLADE with a smudge of CRIMSON BLOOD on its TIP. \nWe feel a count of Two Mississippi... \nELLE, \nBLOOD begins to PROJECTILE SPRAY out of a slice in Elle's neck only a quarter of an inch long. The Blood does not exit the neck as liquid but as a FINE RED MIST, like that of an aerosol can, we even HEAR the slight SPRAY WHISTLE. Elle feels nothing. She turns her eyes towards the sound of the spray, and sees the blood escaping her like air from a balloon. She lifts her hand and places it in the path of the spray, it's immediately BATHED IN RED. \nElle drops the Bride's sword. \nAs her blood continues to escape, both women look across each other. \nThe effect is that Elle Driver is a balloon and her life is escaping before both their very eyes. And now looking across at each other, the two women see the other for the first time, not as adversaries, or opponents, or as rivals, or as bitches...but as sisters. \nElle no longer has enough life in her to stand up...She falls to her knees in front of The Bride.... \n...then as she dies, she leans the side of her head against The Bride's standing body. Her blood runs down The Bride's leg. As she passes on, Elle gently wraps her arms around the Bride's leg. \nThe Bride's hands go down to Elle's long blonde hair, and begins gently stroking it, easing her pain as she expires. \nThey embrace each other. \nB.B. I waited a long time for you to wake up, Mommy. Did you dream of me - I dreamed of you? \nThe female killer says to her daughter as mommieness begins to creep into her voice; \nTHE BRIDE Every single night, baby. \nShe holds her daughter out at arm's length to get a better look at her. \nTHE BRIDE Now let me look at you. My my my... What a pretty girl you are. \nB.B. You're pretty too, Mommy. \nB.B. starts stroking her mother's long blonde hair. \nTHE BRIDE Thank you. \nAll of a sudden, Bill has joined them on the floor. \nBILL When I showed you Mommy's picture, tell Mommy what you said. \nThe little girl gets shy. \nBILL \nC'mon shy girl, you know what you said, tell Mommy, it'll make her fell good. \nAs she strokes her long blonde hair, little B.B. says; \nB.B. I said - I said - You're the most beautiful woman I ever saw in the whole white world. \nBILL That's the truth. That's what she said. \nB.B. points to Manny's blood, which splashed a little on the Bride's wedding gown. \nB.B. What's that? \nMOMMY Oh, Mommy spilled something on her dress. \nB.B. Blood? \nMOMMY No. Kool-Aid. Do you like Kool-Aid? \nB.B. No. \nBILL Do you not like it, or do you not know what it is? \nParroting Bill; \nB.B. I do not know what it is. \nMOMMY Well, it's a very tasty beverage that I used to drink, when I was a little girl. It comes in a lot of different flavors and colors, and it's really good. Maybe we should fix some sometime. Want to do that? \nThe little girl gives a big nod, yes. \nBILL Speaking of fixing and drinking and eating, I think it's dinner time don't you? \nB.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes. \nBILL (to Mommy) When you were doin all that fancy shootin, you didn't happen to shoot a nice Mexican woman about forty five years old, did ya? \nMOMMY No. \nBILL (wiping imaginary sweat off his brow) Whew, then dinner should be done. (shouting to the other room) Josephina! You can come out now, we're ready for dinner. \nJOSEPHINA (O.S.) Yes, Mr. Bill. \nHe offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then says to B.B.; \nBILL Want to go on top of the world? \nShe says excitedly; \nB.B. Yeah! \nHe scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The Carpenter's song, \"Top Of The World.\" It's obviously one of their songs. \nINT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT \nThe dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating. \nBILL B.B., don't you think Mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world? \nB.B. Yes I do. \nBILL In fact it's better than pretty. What's better than pretty? \nB.B. Gorgeous. \nBILL Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is gorgeous. \nThe Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill. \nBILL You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy. \nB.B. \nWhy? Where you a bad daddy? \nBILL I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad daddy. (to Mommy) Our little girl learned about life and death the other day. (to B.B.) You want to tell Mommy about what happened to Emilio? \nB.B. I killed him. I didn't mean to, but I stepped on him and he stopped moving. \nBILL Emilio was her goldfish. She came running into my room holding the fish in her hand, crying, \"Daddy daddy, Emilio's dead.\" And I said, \"Really, that's so sad. How did he die?\" And what did you say? \nB.B. I stepped on him. \nBILL Actually young lady, the words you so strategically used were, \"I accidentally stepped on him.\" Right? \nB.B. Yeah. \nBILL To which I queried, \"And just how did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?\" And she told me no no no, Emilio was on the carpet when she stepped on him. (beat) Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And just how did Emilio get on the \ncarpet? And Mommy, you would have been real proud of her, because she didn't lie. She said she took Emilio out of his bowl, and put him on the carpet. And what was Emilio doing on the carpet, baby? \nB.B. He was -- flapping. \nBILL And then you stomped on him? \nB.B. Uh-huh. \nBILL And when you lifted your foot up, what was Emilio doing then? \nB.B. Nothing. \nBILL He stopped flapping, didn't he? \nB.B. Uh-huh. \nBILL And you knew what that meant, didn't you? \nB.B. Uh-huh. \nBILL What did that mean? \nB.B. He was dead. \nBILL (to Mommy) She told me later, that the second she lifted up her foot and saw him not flapping, she knew he was dead. Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death? A fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet. So powerful even a five-year old child with no concept of life and death knew what it meant. Not only did she know Emilio was dead, she knew she had killed him. So she comes running into my room, holding Emilio in both of her little hands - it was so cute - and she wanted me to make Emilio better. And I asked her, why did she step on Emilio? And she said, she didn't know. But I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt Emilio, you just wanted to see what would happen if you stepped on him, right? \nB.B. Uh-huh. \nBILL And what happens when you stomp on Emilio, is you kill him. And you discovered that, didn't you? \nA SHOTGUN BLAST BLOWS A HOLE in the door, right where the bent over woman was previously standing. \nKaren kicks open the door, Pump Action Shotgun in hand. \nThe Bride's on her back, on the floor below her. \nKaren aims the shotgun down at her. \nWith her foot, The Bride kicks the front door. \nIt SLAMS BACK HITTING Karen in the face. \nThe Bride scrambles to her feet, running for cover. \nKaren pushes the door aside, steps into the room, and FIRES the shotgun The Bride's way. \nThe Bride DIVES out of the way. \nThe BLAST DESTROYS the side of the room it HITS. \nThe Bride comes up from the floor with her SOG in her hand, and THROWS IT across the room at Karen... \nKaren BLOCKS the thrown knife with her shotgun. The blade sticking in the weapon's wooden stock. She removes the knife, and drops it to the floor. \nThe Bride is a sitting duck. There's nothing she can do except wait to get shot. \nKAREN So you came here to kill Lisa Wong, huh? Well that's my sister, bitch. I'm Karen Wong, and I've come here to kill you. \nShe raises the shotgun, and takes aim at The Bride... \nTHE BRIDE Wait a second! \nKaren stops. \nTHE BRIDE Yes, I'm an assassin. Yes I did come here to kill your sister. But I'm not gonna do that now. \nKAREN Oh, I know you're not -- \nTHE BRIDE - listen to me! I just found out, right now - not two minutes before you blew a hole in the door, I'm pregnant. \nKaren looks at her, \"what?\". \nTHE BRIDE On that table is the    home pregnancy kit. On the floor by    the door is the strip that says    I'm pregnant. I'm telling you the    truth, I don't want to and I won't    kill your sister. I just want    to go home. \nKAREN What is this, bullshit story number twelve in the female assassin's handbook? \nTHE BRIDE Any other time you'd be a hundred percent right. But this time you're a hundred percent wrong. I'm the deadliest woman in the world, but right now I'm scared shitless for my baby. Please, you hafta believe me. Look at the strip, it's on the floor. \nKaren looks over to the door, and sees the tiny strip on the floor. \nKAREN Sit down on that bed and put your hands behind your head. \nThe Bride complies. Karen bends down and picks the strip off the floor. Then takes the package it came in and reads the directions on the box. \nTHE BRIDE Blue means pregnant. \nKAREN I'll read it myself, thank you. \nIt is blue, Karen's starting to believe her. \nKAREN Okay, say I were to believe you, what then? \nTHE BRIDE Just go home. I'll do the same. \nKaren does...She starts backing out of the room...before she leaves, she says; \nKAREN You fucked with the Wong sisters. \nBACK ON THE PORCH \nTHE BRIDE Facing Karen Wong, was the most frightening moment I have ever experienced. And that includes three years with that evil bastard Pai Mei. Before that strip turned blue, I was a woman, I was your woman. I was a killer, who killed for you. Before that strip turned blue, I would have jumped a motorcycle on to a speeding train ...for you. But once that strip turned blue, I could no longer do any of those things. Not anymore. Because now I was a mother. A mother who only had one thought on her mind. Please don't harm my baby. Can you understand that? \nBILL Yes. But why tell me now, and not then? \nTHE BRIDE You wouldn't have let me go. Specially once you found out I was pregnant. You would've tried to talk me out of it. It would have been a big scene. I just said fuck it. \nStarting to get mad. \nBILL Fuck who? \nTHE BRIDE Bill, you couldn't know I was pregnant, once you knew, you'd claim it, and I didn't want that. \nBILL That's not your decision to make. \nTHE BRIDE Yes, but it's the right decision. And I made it for my daughter. Everybody on this earth deserves to start with a clean slate. But with us - my daughter would be born into a world she shouldn't be. Robbing her of the one thing everybody deserves. She would be born with blood stains. I had to choose. I chose her. \nShe takes a sip of wine. It's morning now. And now it's her turn. \nTHE BRIDE You know five years ago, if I had to make a list of impossible things that could never happen. You performing a coup de grace on me by bustin a cap in my crown, would be right at the top of the list. (beat) I'd've been wrong, wouldn't I? \nBill listens stoney, then; \nBILL I'm sorry was that a question? Of impossible things that could never happen - yes in this instance you would have been wrong. \nThe Bride listens stoney, then; \nTHE BRIDE Well? \nBILL Well what? \nTHE BRIDE Explain yourself. \nBILL I already have. When I told you the story of when I thought you were dead. Didn't you get how badly I felt? \nTHE BRIDE You call that an explanation? \nBILL Well if that's too cryptic let's get literal. (beat) There are consequences to breaking the heart of a murdering bastard. You experienced some of them. \nThat's his explanation. \nShe hears it. \nThey both understand one another. \nTHE BRIDE You and I have unfinished business. \nBILL Baby, you ain't kidding. \nThey both laugh. \nBILL You know how proud I am of you, don't you? \nTHE BRIDE Yes. \nBILL You know I was rooting for you, don't you? \nTHE BRIDE I figured. \nBILL You know on that beach out there I want you to be the victor? \nShe nods her head, yes. \nBILL You also know you're going to have to defeat me. I can't just give it to you, even though I want to. \nTHE BRIDE It won't be necessary for you to give me anything. I've surpassed you. I'll take it. \nBILL Well, as they say in Missouri, show me. \nEXT. THE BEACH - MORNING \nAs the blue waves of the Gulf of Mexico crash on the beach, The Bride in her bridal gown, and Bill, his tuxedo jacket off, face each other in a combat stance. \nThe BRIDE Breeze blowing her blonde hair, holding her Hanzo sword in its sheath. \n", "test1_input": "The Bride, runs across lawns and hides behind parked cars on the street, as the bullets rip up homes, lawns, and automobiles. \nWhen Yuki's car reaches the end of the dead end,... \nShe jerks the wheel... \nSPINNING the car around, pointing it in the opposite direction. \nSHE HITS THE GAS AGAIN... \nSHE PULLS THE MACHINE GUN TRIGGER AGAIN... \nBULLETS TEAR UP the cars lining the street. \nIn the hail of bullets, the Bride tries to fire back. \nYuki reaches the end of the street and spins the car around. \nShe gets ready to make a third pass. \nSome PEOPLE in the house behind the Bride, look out of their front door. \nThe Bride yells at them; \nTHE BRIDE Stay in your house and stay down on the floor! \nYuki speeds after her, but this time she pops the curb and drives across the front lawns on the street heading right for her. \nThe Bride runs into the house she's in front of. \nShe runs through the living room, to the kitchen and the back door, but the kitchen's where the family that lives here is hiding and they block the door. \nYuki's sports car pulls up in front of the house. She stands up in the convertible. Takes out a grenade, pulls the pin and says; \nYUKI (JAPANESE) Time for the rabbit to come out of her hole! \nShe lobs the grenade up on the porch, then throws herself face down on the lawn. \nThe porch and the front of the house explodes into splinters. \nEverybody in the kitchen is blown back. \nRealizing there's no getting out of the back door, the Bride runs back into the living room that's now missing a wall, and runs up the home's staircase leading to the bedrooms. \nYuki steps into the house, sub-machine gun in hand... \nThe Bride makes it to the top of the stairs, and is just about to disappear behind the upstairs hallway wall... \nWHEN... \nYuki fires up at her, hitting her twice in the leg. \nThe upstairs hallway, two bedroom doorways line both sides of the hallway. The Bride crashes to the floor -- SCREAMING -- blood pours out of her gunshots. \nYuki charges up the stairs...machine gun blazing, tearing up the house. \nThe Bride aims her 9mm where she expects Yuki to emerge. \nYuki gets to the top of the stairs, and steps into the hallway. \nThe Bride fires... \nThe Bride's bullet wings Yuki in the left breast, knocking her through a bedroom doorway. \nTHE BRIDE (to herself) Gotcha! \nYuki screams like a little girl at the pain. She yells from the doorway into the hallway; \nYUKI (JAPANESE) You fucking bitch! You shot me in my breast! They're not fully developed yet, you fucking asshole! Now I'm always gonna have a dimple! \nThe Bride answers Yuki back with an imitation of Yuki's giggle, which makes the youngin blow her top. \nYUKI (JAPANESE) Piss me off! \nShe fires her machine gun around the corner, tearing up everything around the Bride. \nWhen the young girl stops firing, the Bride yells; \nTHE BRIDE    (JAPANESE) Yuki, in about two    minutes there's going to be an army    of police here. So if you're gonna    kill me, now's the time. \nFrom her hiding place, Yuki snorts a line of baby blue powder. It gives her energy. \nTHE BRIDE (O.S., ENGLISH) So what's it gonna be bitch? \nSlapping a new clip in her machine gun. \nYUKI (JAPANESE) That fucking does it! \nYuki comes around the corner FIRING her machine gun in the \nBride's direction, ripping up everything around her. \nThe Bride lying flat on the floor fires her 9mm. \nThe explosion of ammo creates the hysteria of warfare combat. \nYuki charges the Bride, Kamakazi style. \nThree more bullets rip into the Bride, the Bride fires up at Yuki, hitting her three times in the body, knocking her off her feet, and sending her tumbling down the stairs. \nThe Bride shot up, pulls herself to the top of the stairs. She sees Yuki lying at the bottom, dead. \nYuki's face, dead,    eyes closed...then they pop up open... Guess what...she's    not dead. Though she's bloody and her schoolgirl uniform    is filled with bullet holes she rises. Her head turns in the    direction of the Bride... \nThe Bride sees this and can't believe it... \nThey lock eyes... \n...Yuki, who no longer has the machine gun, takes out a deadly looking knife and snaps it open with a smile that builds to a scream... \nShe charges up the steps at the Bride. \nThe startled Bride fires at her...the 9mm's empty... \nYuki charging up the steps, yelling, knife raised high... \nThe Bride, hurriedly removes the pistol she keeps in her ankle holster. \nYuki chargin... \nThe Bride cocks back the hammer... \n...Yuki charging, getting closer... \nThe Bride FIRES \nBullet hits Yuki, stops her for a quarter of a second, but she keeps charging... \nThe Bride fires again... \nYuki jerks but keeps on charging... \nBride fires... \nYuki jerks, but keeps charging... \nBride fires... \nYuki jerks, keeps chargin, almost at her, knife raised high... \nThe Bride FIRES \nYuki jerks, but keeps charging, knife ready to do its duty... \n", "test1_true": "Yuki leaps on her with the knife... \nThey struggle for a moment... \n...TILL... \n...The Bride realizes Yuki's dead. She tosses her to the side. \nTHE BRIDE Goddamn, what a wildcat. \nINT. NURSE OWEN'S HOME - NIGHT \nThe phone rings and a black woman in a nurse's uniform with a name tag on it that reads, \"B. Owens,\" answers the phone. \nNURSE OWENS Hello. \nCU The Bride on her cell phone, a business card in her hand, with a number written on the back that says, \"B. Owens,\" and her phone number. She's bleeding from her five bullet holes. Sitting in a pool of her own blood. She's starting to tremble. We can't see where she's at, but it's somewhere surrounded by wood planks. The moon shines into the structure. \nTHE BRIDE Hello, I'm calling Nurse Owens -- \nNURSE OWENS Who is this. \nTHE BRIDE You don't know me, but -- \nNURSE OWENS -- And I don't want to neither. Now \nI don't know how you got my number, but you can just rip that shit up, because -- \nTHE BRIDE -- I've been shot five times -- \nNURSE OWENS -- Stop, I don't wanna hear no more. I got problems of my own. \nTHE BRIDE I'm dying. \nNURSE OWENS Then bitch, you better call yourself a ambulance, cause I don't do this shit no more. \nTHE BRIDE I can't call an ambulance. \nNURSE OWENS --    No, you can call a ambulance, you    just don't want to. But if your ass    is really dying, you ain't got no    motherfuckin choice. \nTHE BRIDE I do have a choice, and I'm choosing to call you. If you refuse to help me, I'll die. And that will be your choice. \nNURSE OWENS Bitch, I don't even know you! \nTHE BRIDE What do you need to know? I'm from Earth, I'm a woman, I'm dying, and only you can help me. \nHer last line has an effect on the hard-hearted nurse. \nNURSE OWENS Okay, where you at? \nTHE BRIDE I'm in Hawthorne. I'm hiding in a kids treehouse. It's a street called, \"Dimmick\". 1-7-3-6 Dimmick Avenue. There's a bunch of police cars and firetrucks, about two blocks away. \nNURSE OWENS Whatcha do, crawl two blocks? \nTHE BRIDE If you can't walk, you better crawl. \nNurse Owens likes that last line. \nNURSE OWENS You got you some money dontcha, or am I doin this out of the goodness of my heart? \nTHE BRIDE You come and get me, today's pay day. \nNURSE OWENS You ain't too far away. You gonna bleed to death I get there in a half a hour? \nTHE BRIDE Probably. \nNURSE OWENS Okay, I'll be there in fifteen minutes. \nTHE BRIDE Is that Pacific Standard Time, or C.P.T.? \nNURSE OWENS Just you better be there    when I get there, and you better be    shot five times, and your bony ass    better be on your last motherfuckin    legs. \nTHE BRIDE How do you know I have a bony ass? \nNURSE OWENS You sound like you have a bony ass. \nThe Nurse hangs up the phone. \nINT. TREEHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Bride sits in her own blood waiting for Nurse Owens. \nNurse Owens' head pops up from the door in the floor. \nTHE BRIDE Glad you made it. \nNURSE OWENS There's cops all over here, I had to be cool. They tend to notice things like Negroes sneaking around people's backyards. \nThe nurse hands the Bride a big bottle of Wild Turkey. \nTHE BRIDE What's that? \nNURSE OWENS This shit's gonna hurt, and I ain't got no anesthetic. \n(refers to the bottle) So git busy. \nINT. NURSE OWEN'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nOVERHEAD SHOT The Bride laid out on Nurse Owens' kitchen table, while the nurse extracts the bullets. \nThe Bride screams. \nThe TV is turned up loud to hide the screams. \nThe fifth slug is placed in an ashtray next to three cigarette butts and other balls of lead. \nThe Bride, drunk as a skunk, says to her savior; \nTHE BRIDE That fuckin smarts. \nSmoking her menthol Kool, Nurse Owens says; \nNURSE OWENS Yeah, bullets are bad news. In the future, you should avoid them if you can. \nTHE BRIDE I'll keep that in mind. So, do I have a future? \nNURSE OWENS You'll live to kill again. \nTHE BRIDE Splendid. \nShe passes out. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nBLACK FRAME TITLE CARD: \nChapter six \n\"Can she bake a cherry pie.\" \nEX CU SLOT IN DOOR is slid open revealing two male eyes on the other side. \nDOORMAN (O.S.)

Then like a mallet, brings the handle end down hard on the top of The Bride's head. She lets out a howl, and falls to the floor, holding the lump on her noggin. \nPAI MEI * I'm a hundred and fifty years old, and you can't even make me break a sweat. \nHe CHOPS the sword in half with his hand. \nPAI MEI * Let's see your Tiger and Crane style match my Eagles's Claw. \nAgain she ATTACKS...again he eludes. \nLike a Gordon Liu and Lo Lieh film, they do their animal style martial arts dance. \nAs she STRIKES and he BLOCKS...he yells out; \nPAI MEI * ...pathetic.....terrible...you idiot, you should've landed that blow...you call that crane?... Enough, I grow bored. \nWith little effort on his part, he reaches out and GRABS her wrist, TWISTS...She's on the floor, with her arm stuck out in the air behind her, her wrist still between his fingers. He could literally break her arm in half. \nPAI MEI * I asked you to show me what you know, and you did. Not a goddamn thing. \nHe TWISTS her wrist... \n...The pain is excruciating..... \nPAI MEI * Like all yankee women, the only thing you know how to do is order \nin restaurants and spend a man's money. \nHe TWISTS more... \nShe CRIES OUT. \nPAI MEI * Excruciating isn't it? I asked you a question! \nThrough gritted teeth, she answers; \nTHE BRIDE * Yes! \nPAI MEI * I could chop off your arm at will. I think I shall. \nHe raises his other hand to chop off her arm. \nThe Bride SCREAMS in ENGLISH; \nTHE BRIDE No please don't! \nPAI MEI * If you wish to speak romantic languages, you've come to the wrong place. \nTHE BRIDE * Please don't cut my arm off! \nPAI MEI * It's my arm now. I can do with it what I please. If you can stop me, I suggest you try. \nTHE BRIDE * I can't! \nPAI MEI * Because you're helpless? \nTHE BRIDE * Yes! \nPAI MEI * Have you ever felt this before? \nTHE BRIDE * No! \nPAI MEI * Compared to me you're as helpless as a worm fighting an eagle, aren't you? \nTHE BRIDE * Yes!!! \nPAI MEI * THAT'S THE BEGGING! \nHe lets go of her wrist. She cradles her still-throbbing arm. \nPAI MEI * Is it your wish to learn how to make others as helpless as you were? \nTHE BRIDE * Yes. \nPAI MEI * Can you cook? \nTHE BRIDE * Yes. \nPAI MEI * I'll be the judge of    that.

His right fist is cocked back by his breastplate, he's concentrating on a certain spot on the wall. \nThe Bride stands behind him, watching. \nHe lets out a SCREAM, and puts his fist THROUGH THE WALL. \nHe turns to the new student; \nPAI MEI * Since your arm now belongs to me, I want it strong. Can you do that? \nTHE BRIDE * I can, but not that close. \nPAI MEI * Then you can't do it. \nTHE BRIDE * I can put my hand through that at six inches. \nPAI MEI * And you could shoot a man from a rooftop with a scope-sight rifle, if you so desired, but this is not what I asked. What if your enemy is three inches in front of you, what do you do then? Curl into a ball? Or do you put your fist through him. \nHe HITS the wall again leaving another hole. \nPAI MEI * Now begin. \nThe Bride takes her place in front of the wall. She HITS it. Only managing to stain the wall with the blood from her scraped knuckles. Then again. And again.... \nINT. DINNER TABLE - NIGHT \nBoth Pai Mei    and The Bride sit at the dinner table. Pai Mei concentrates    on eating. The Bride's hand is scraped bloody. She tries to    eat a bowl of rice with chopsticks, but her fingers won't    work. She puts down the sticks and takes a scoop of rice    with her fingers. \nPai Mei WHACKS her on top of her head with his stick. \nPAI MEI * If you want to eat like a dog, I will make you live and sleep like a dog. Outside. If you want to live and sleep like a human being, pick up those sticks. \nShe does. \nTHE WOOD WALL \nThe Bride HITTING it. \nShe looks at her fucked-up hand, then to the wall, hesitating....Then Pai Mei's behind her. \nPAI MEI * It's the wood that       should fear your hand, not the other       way around.

If you catch the rat, I will deem you the victor, and tonight you will dine on bird. But, if you can't catch the rat by sundown, I'll deem the victor the rat. And because of the disgrace to my student, I will be forced to kill it. And then I will force you, to consume his body. Because to be my student, you must develop a taste for victory. \nShe hops into the pit, gets down on the ground, lock eyes with her rodent opponent, and goes after it. \nThe BRIDE Practicing her Tiger/Crane combo Kung Fu. \nMORE wall.... \nAt NIGHT punching the wall in front of her in her sleep. \nTrying to catch the rat to no avail. \nWHEN... \nA golden arrow kills the rat. \nShe looks up and sees Pai Mei, golden bow in his hand, looking down on her. It's sundown. \nShe stands, dusting herself off (she's dirty from the chase) and looks at her teacher. \nShe picks her dead foe up from the earth, and removes the golden arrow. Then with the rat in her hand, she looks up to her teacher. \nTHE BRIDE * I acknowledge defeat at the paws of this rat. However, I will not eat this filthy vermin. What I will do... (she RIPS the rat open like a pomegranate) ...is consume his victorious heart. (she snatches the tiny heart from the rodent's carcass. Holding it between her fingers.) But tomorrow, you kill a big bird. \nShe POPS the tiny rat heart in her mouth, and begins to chew. \nPai Mei looking down on her, says; \nPAI MEI * How does victory taste? \nTHE BRIDE * Bitter. \nWe do a Shaw Brothers ZOOM into a CU on Pai Mei, he gives an affirmative NOD and GRUNT. \nThe BRIDE'S FIST goes through the wall. \nTHE BRIDE (to herself) Wow! \nINT. PAI MEI'S PRIVATE BATHROOM - DAY \nPai Mei splashing by himself in his huge bathtub, when he hears a noise. \nPAI MEI * Woman, is that you who disturbs my meditation? \nShe answers from outside the door; \nTHE BRIDE'S VOICE (O.S.) Yes, teacher. \nPAI MEI * Enter. \nShe does, bowing to one knee. \nPAI MEI * What news do you find so worthy, as to disrupt my bath? \nTHE BRIDE * I did it teacher. I put my fist through the wall. \nTIME CUT \nPAI MEI and the BRIDE looking at the hole in the wall. \nPAI MEI * Very good. Would you care to demonstrate? \nShe moves in front of the wall.....Takes her position...Her right hand in a fist -- Locked and loaded into position.... With Her left hand she reaches out and touches the wall where she'll strike....Like she's transferring her energy into the wood...She removes her left hand...and...STRIKES! \nShe hits it HARD, but her fist doesn't go through. \nHer eyes sneak a look at the old man, who wears no expression. \nTHE BRIDE * I think you watching is making me nervous. \nPAI MEI * Not only that, it has you speaking before you were spoken to. Try again. \nShe does. \nAnd when she does, she DOES it. \nCU PAI MEI he says in ENGLISH; \nPAI MEI Impressive. \nShe immediately goes down to her knees; \nTHE BRIDE * Thank you teacher -- \nHe just as immediately, lifts her back up. \nPAI MEI * You still fight better than you speak. Finally, a woman who understands what's important. \nTHEN... \nHe MOVES the wall one inch in front of her. \nPAI MEI * Begin again. \nThen the old man leaves to finish his bath. \nThe blonde gal begins again....Fist against wood...no effect....starting all over. \nCUT TO: \nBACK TO COFFIN, SIX FEET UNDER \nPITCH BLACK -- The Flashlight Beam turns on. CU The BRIDE in Profile. Her breathing is normal. We can hear the soft beat of her heart inside the pine box. Her composure is back. \nTaking the flashlight, she Shines the beam on the lid above her....Along the line of the coffin's rim and the lid where many nails meet....Then down to her Red Cowboy Boots, bound by a leather belt around her. \nRaising her knees, as much as the coffin will allow, and wiggling her feet, she slips her bare feet our of the boots and the belt's binding...Then, using her bare feet, then her bound-at-the-wrist hands, to pass one of the boots up to her...When the red boot is in her grasp, she turns it upside down....The STRAIGHT RAZOR falls out. \nOpening the razor, she slices through the ropes that tie her wrists, till both hands are free. \nShe positions the flashlight so its Beam Shines on the coffin lid. The lid's about an inch and a half from the tip of her nose, about three inches from her hand. \nTHEN... \nAS COMBAT DRUMS BEGIN TO BEAT ON THE SOUNDTRACK, she begins to concentrate. Her eyes focus on the wood above her, her left hand reaches out, touches the pine, passing her energy to it... \n...Her long, white fingers, ball up into a FIST.... \n...and that FIST begins STRIKING the coffin lid above her. \nWith each Strike she lets out a KARATE SCREAM... \nAGAIN... \nAnd AGAIN... \nHer FIST SMASHES into the wood, leaving BLOOD on the lid... \nAGAIN... \n", "test2_id": 2617, "test3_input": "THE BRIDE Oh, it's me all right. \nBILL I hear you were driving a truck? \nTHE BRIDE My pussy wagon died on me.

(pause) I want to meet her. \nBILL Have dinner with us at my hacienda tonight. She's expecting you. \nTHE BRIDE What do you mean? \nBILL I knew you were on your way, so I told B.B. Her mommy was coming to see her. \nTHE BRIDE (confused) What have you told her about me? \nBILL That you were sick, that you were asleep, but one day you'd wake up and come back to her. And she asked me, \"If Mommy's been asleep since I was born, how will she know what I look like?\" To which I replied, \"Because Mommy's been dreaming of you.\" And she said, \"Then I'm gonna start dreaming of her.\" So I gave her a \npicture of you -- \nTHE BRIDE -- which one? \nBILL The one I took of you in Paris, sitting on the steps with the baguette in your hand. Since she was one and a half years old, she's slept with that picture of you next to her bed. \nThe EXACT PHOTO DISSOLVES OVER The Bride's face, then DISSOLVES AWAY. \nTHE BRIDE You know, prettier photos of me do exist. \nBILL And she's seen them.

(pause) We normally have dinner around seven, is that convenient? \nTHE BRIDE Yes. \nPause....The cars get closer... \nTHE BRIDE When do we cross swords? \nBILL Well, it just so happens, my hacienda comes with its very own private beach. And my private beach, just so happens to look particularly beautiful bathed in moonlight. And there just so happens to be a full moon out tonight. So, swordfighter, if you \nwant to sword fight, that's where I suggest. But if you wanna be old school about it - then we can wait till dawn, and slice each other up at sunrise, like a couple real life honest to goodness samurais. As per usual Kiddo, I'll leave the big decisions up to you. \nThe cars will soon pass... \nTHE BRIDE Do me a courtesy? \nBILL Anything. \nTHE BRIDE Slow down as we pass...I want another look at her. \nBILL Wear something nice tonight? \nTHE BRIDE I have a dress all picked out. \nBILL Will I like it? \nTHE BRIDE You said I looked beautiful last time you saw me in it. \nBILL I'll dress up too. \nHis foot moves off the gas, slowing the car; her foot does the same. \nThe cars in SLOW MOTION start to pass. \nThe Bride looks into the other car. \nWe ZOOM past Bill to the little girl in the passenger seat. We go ONE FRAME AT A TIME till the car moves past us, to Bill holding a pistol with a large silencer pointing right at our face. He FIRES. It emits only a tiny PHOOF. \nThe Bride throws herself across the passenger seat as the driver's side window EXPLODES over her head. \nThe two cars pass each other. \nThe Bride straightens herself in the driver's seat. She looks in the rearview as Bill and her daughter drive away. Grabbing the cell phone she screams in it; \nTHE BRIDE You fucking maricone! \nBill on his cell, eyes on rearview. \nBILL Now you just wait one second there little missy. Unless I'm confused, we are trying to kill each other aren't we? Now I wasn't planning on taking a shot at you in front of the squirt, but, she is asleep. And if you're gonna forget everything I ever taught you, and gawk like you ain't got good sense, I'm gonna take a shot, am I not? \nTHE BRIDE Did she wake up? \nBILL Of course not.

Fuck the charade, storm the camp, kill everyone she comes across, send Bill to hell, scoop up her daughter, and head for parts unknown. \nSo far, so good. \nShe enters the butcher block kitchen, and finds Bill's cook and housekeeper, Josephina. \nJosephina stares at the shotgun barrel pointed at her. \nTHE BRIDE Hello Josephina. \nJOSEPHINA Hello Miss Beatrix. \nShe grabs the housekeeper, and shoves her into the kitchen pantry. \nTHE BRIDE Stay in here and don't come out. If you leave this room I'll shoot you, comprende? \nJOSEPHINA Yes. \nShe closes the pantry door, and moves into the hallway leading to the living room. \nWith her back against the wall, holding her weapon tight, she moves down the hall.

Standing next to him is five-year-old little B.B., dressed    up in a very pretty party dress, arm outstretched holding    a orange squirt gun, aimed at The Bride. \nThe three look at each other for a moment, then Bill says; \nBILL (loudly) Bang Bang! \nThen he suddenly clutches his abdomen like he's just been shot. \nBILL Oh B.B., Mommy got us. \nB.B. lowers her gun and plays out a big dying scene alongside her dad...Bill falls to the floor. \nBILL Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying... \nB.B. parrots this. \nB.B. Oh, I'm dying...I'm dying... \nBill on the floor, says up to his little girl; \nBILL Fall down sweetheart, Mommy shot you. \nThe little girl falls down pretend dead. \nThe Bride, still absentmindedly pointing her weapon at them, is truly thrown. \nBill delivers his lines from the floor, spoken like a dying breath; \nBILL You did it Quick Draw Kiddo.

Hey, get back down there, you're playing possum. \nThe little girl's head drops back down. \nBill continues his dramatic narration; \nBILL So, as the smirking killer approached, what she thought, was a bullet-ridden corpse,...that's when the little B.B.

I should have known, you are the best. \nShe falls to the floor and pretends to die. \nThe little girl in her party dress, runs over to the big girl in her wedding dress, and kneels over her mommy. \nMommy opens her eyes. \nB.B.

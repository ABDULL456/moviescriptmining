BUDD'S CAMPER'S KITCHEN - DAY \nBudd and Elle in the tiny kitchen of Budd's tiny camper. Elle sits a the kitchen table, a black suitcase by her feet. Budd stands at a blender making them both breakfast margaritas, as he finishes telling the tale of last night. \nELLE ...So that's called a Texas funeral? \nBUDD Yep. \nELLE I got to give it to ya Budd, that's a pretty fucked up way to die. What's the name on the grave she's buried under? \nBUDD Paula Schultz. \nBudd turns on the NOISY blender, as Elle writes down the    name Paula Schultz on a small notepad, placing it back inside    her pocket. As the blender MASHES ICE, Elle looks around and    sees the Bride's Hanzo sword in its sheath, leaning up against    the T.V. In the front room. Budd shuts the blender off. \nELLE \nCan I look at the sword? \nBUDD That's my money in that black case, isn't it? \nELLE Sure is. \nBUDD Well then, it's your sword now. \nThe tall blonde girl steps into the living room, takes the Hanzo sword, and sits back down on the kitchen chair. \nShe slowly removes the Japanese steel from its wood sheath. \nELLE So this, is a Hattori Hanzo sword. \nBudd answers as he fills up two former peanut butter jars with breakfast margaritas. \nBUDD That's a Hanzo sword alright. \nELLE Bill tells me you once had one of your own. \nPause. \nBUDD Once. \nELLE How does this one compare to that one? \nBUDD If you're gonna compare a Hanzo sword, you compare it to every \nsword ever made -- wasn't made by Hattori Hanzo. Here, wrap your lips around this. \nHe hands her her margarita, she takes a sip. He takes a gulp. \nBUDD So, which \"R\" you filled with? \nELLE What? \nBUDD They say the number one killer of old people is retirement. People got'em a job to do, they tend to live a little longer so they can do it. I've always figured warriors and their enemies share the same relationship. So now you ain't gonna hafta face your enemy on the battlefield no more, which \"R\" are you filled with, Relief or Regret? \nELLE A little bit of both. \nBUDD Bullshit. I'm sure you do feel a little bit of both. But I know damn well you feel one more than you feel the other. The question was which one? \nElle looks right at him with her eye, and says; \nELLE Regret. \nBUDD Yeah you gotta hand it to the ol' girl. I never saw nobody buffalo Bill the way she buffaloed Bill. Bill useta think she was so damn smart. I tried to tell him... Bill, she's just smart for a blonde. \nHe looks over at Elle and grins. \nElle looks at him. \nELLE Want your money? \nShe gestures to the black suitcase by her feet. \n", "test2_true": "Lying inside is a cool million, the thousand dollar bills are inside stacks of a hundred thousand each. At the sight of all this lettuce, Budd lets out a whistle. \nBUDD Great day in the morning. \nHe lifts a stack out of the bag, then another, then another...and when he lifts the third stack out, he looks down and sees a BLACK MAMBA SNAKE coiled underneath. \nThe Black Mamba opens its WIDE JAWS...and LEAPS RIGHT AT BUDD... \n...STRIKING Budd in the face repeatedly in blurred succession (three times in the face, and once in the forearm). \nBudd topples out of the kitchen chair onto the floor, bundles of money fall with him. \nElle takes a sip of her Margarita. \nThe Black Mamba leaves Budd and goes under the refridgerator. \nElle looks down, Budd    lies on his back on the kitchen floor at her feet. His face    is already grotesquely swollen and white as a sheet. The    serpent's extraordinarily potent venom makes a full-frontal    assault on the cowboys's nervous system. \nELLE Oh, I'm sorry Budd, that was rude of me wasn't it? Budd -- I'd like to introduce my friend, The Black Mamba. (gesturing towards the refridgerator) Black Mamba -- this is Budd. You know before I picked up that little fella, I looked him up on the internet. (she removes her notepad from her pocket) \nFascinating creature the Black Mamba. Listen to this, (reading from the notepad) \"...In Africa, the saying goes, in the bush, an elephant can kill you. A leopard can kill you. And a Black Mamba can kill you. But only with the Mamba, and this has been true in Africa since the dawn of time, is death sure. Hence its handle; Death Incarnate.\" (looking up from the paper) Pretty cool, huh? (back to paper) \"...Its neurotoxic venom is one of nature's most effective poisons, acting on the nervous system causing paralysis. The venom of a Black Mamba can kill a human in four hours, if say bitten on the ankle or the thumb. However, a bite to the face or torso can bring death from paralysis within twenty minutes. (up from paper to Budd) Now you should listen to this cause this concerns you. (reading from the paper) The amount of venom that can be delivered from a single bit can be gargantuan. (looks up from paper) -- You know I've always liked that word Gargantuan, and I so rarely have an opportunity to use it in a sentence. (back to paper) \"If not treated quickly with anti venom, 10 to 15 milligrams can be fatal to human beings. However, the Black Mamba can deliver as much as 100 to 400 milligrams of venom from a single bite.\" \nElle finishes reading and puts the paper away. She looks down at Budd at her feet, going through all the symptoms she just described. \nELLE Now in these last agonizing minutes of life you have left, let me answer the question you asked earlier, more thoroughly. When it comes to that bitch, I gotta lotta \"R's\" in me. Revenge is one. Retribution is another. Rivalry is definitely one. But I got another \n\"R\" for that bitch you might be surprised to find out. Respect. But right at this moment, the biggest \"R\" I feel, is Regret. Regret that maybe the greatest warrior I have ever met, met her end at the hands of a bushwhackin, scrub, alacky piece of shit like you. The woman deserved better. \nBudd, dying, watches from the floor as Elle takes out her cell phone and presses one button. The other party comes on the line, but we never hear their side. \nELLE (into phone) Bill...Elle. I have some tragic news. (pause) Your brother's dead. (pause) I'm sorry baby. \nBudd tries to make a sound from the floor, Elle calmly places her foot over his mouth. \nELLE (CONT'D) She put a Black Mamba in his camper. (pause) I got her, sweety. (pause) She's dead. (pause) Let me put it this way. If you ever start feeling sentimental, go to Austin, Texas. When you get here, walk into a florist and buy a bunch of flowers.

I'll be there soon. \nShe hangs up the cell phone, and looks down at the dead man under her shoe. \nPicking up the Hanzo sword, she climbs down on the floor on her hands and knees to pick up the fallen money. \nCU The BLACK MAMBA out from under the refrigerator, behind Elle... \nElle senses it.

Want to do that? \nThe little girl gives a big nod, yes. \nBILL Speaking of fixing and drinking and eating, I think it's dinner time don't you? \nB.B. does an exaggerated nod, yes. \nBILL (to Mommy) When you were doin all that fancy shootin, you didn't happen to shoot a nice Mexican woman about forty five years old, did ya? \nMOMMY No. \nBILL (wiping imaginary sweat off his brow) Whew, then dinner should be done. (shouting to the other room) Josephina! You can come out now, we're ready for dinner. \nJOSEPHINA (O.S.) Yes, Mr. Bill. \nHe offers his hand to Mommy, and helps her to her feet. Then says to B.B.; \nBILL Want to go on top of the world? \nShe says excitedly; \nB.B. Yeah! \nHe scoops the little girl up, puts her on his shoulders, and as the mommy and the daddy and their little girl walk through the house towards the dinner table, Bill and B.B. Sing The Carpenter's song, \"Top Of The World.\" It's obviously one of their songs. \nINT. DINNER ROOM - NIGHT \nThe dining room of Bill's house. The family, mother father and daughter, sit at the dinner table eating. \nBILL B.B., don't you think Mommy has the prettiest hair in the whole wide world? \nB.B. Yes I do. \nBILL In fact it's better than pretty. What's better than pretty? \nB.B. Gorgeous. \nBILL Very good, gorgeous. Mommy is gorgeous. \nThe Bride shows no sign of thawing around Bill. \nBILL You know baby, Mommy's kinda mad at Daddy. \nB.B. \nWhy? Where you a bad daddy? \nBILL I'm afraid I was. I was a real bad daddy. (to Mommy) Our little girl learned about life and death the other day. (to B.B.) You want to tell Mommy about what happened to Emilio? \nB.B. I killed him. I didn't mean to, but I stepped on him and he stopped moving. \nBILL Emilio was her goldfish. She came running into my room holding the fish in her hand, crying, \"Daddy daddy, Emilio's dead.\" And I said, \"Really, that's so sad. How did he die?\" And what did you say? \nB.B. I stepped on him. \nBILL Actually young lady, the words you so strategically used were, \"I accidentally stepped on him.\" Right? \nB.B. Yeah. \nBILL To which I queried, \"And just how did your foot accidentally find its way into Emilio's fishbowl?\" And she told me no no no, Emilio was on the carpet when she stepped on him. (beat) Hummmmmm, the plot thickens. And just how did Emilio get on the \ncarpet? And Mommy, you would have been real proud of her, because she didn't lie. She said she took Emilio out of his bowl, and put him on the carpet. And what was Emilio doing on the carpet, baby? \nB.B. He was -- flapping. \nBILL And then you stomped on him? \nB.B. Uh-huh. \nBILL And when you lifted your foot up, what was Emilio doing then? \nB.B. Nothing. \nBILL He stopped flapping, didn't he? \nB.B. Uh-huh. \nBILL And you knew what that meant, didn't you? \nB.B. Uh-huh. \nBILL What did that mean? \nB.B. He was dead. \nBILL (to Mommy) She told me later, that the second she lifted up her foot and saw him not flapping, she knew he was dead. Is that not the perfect visual image of life and death? A fish flapping on the carpet, and a fish not flapping on the carpet. So powerful even a five-year old child with no concept of life and death knew what it meant. Not only did she know Emilio was dead, she knew she had killed him. So she comes running into my room, holding Emilio in both of her little hands - it was so cute - and she wanted me to make Emilio better. And I asked her, why did she step on Emilio? And she said, she didn't know. But I knew why. You didn't mean to hurt Emilio, you just wanted to see what would happen if you stepped on him, right? \nB.B. Uh-huh. \nBILL And what happens when you stomp on Emilio, is you kill him. And you discovered that, didn't you? \n", "test3_true": "BILL So we drove down to the beach, had a little funeral, and gave Emilio a burial at sea. And right now I'm sure he's happy as can be, swimmin around in fish heaven. But the point being, our child learned two very important lessons. One, about life and death. The other, somethings once you do, they \ncan't be undone. I knew just how she felt (to B.B.) You loved Emilio, didn't you? \nB.B. Uh-huh. \nBILL Well sweety, I love Mommy, but I did to Mommy what you did to Emilio. \nB.B. You stomped on Mommy? \nBILL Worse. (making his finger a gun) I shot Mommy. Not pretend shoot, like we were just doing. I shot her for real. \nB.B. Why? \nBILL I don't know. \nB.B. Did you want to see what would happen? \nBILL No, I   knew what   would happen to Mommy   if I shot   her. What I didn't know,   is when I   shot Mommy, what would   happen to   me. \nB.B. What happened? \nBILL I was very sad. And that was when I learned, somethings once you do, they can never be undone. \nB.B. What happened to Mommy? \nBILL Why don't you ask Mommy. \nB.B. Are you okay Mommy. Does it hurt? \nBILL No sweety, it doesn't hurt anymore. \nB.B. Did it make you sick? \nMOMMY It put me to sleep. That's why I haven't been with you B.B., I've been asleep. \nB.B. But you're awake now, right? \nMOMMY I'm wide awake, pretty girl. \nEXT. PORCH - DAWN \nBill sits on the steps of his porch in the back of the house drinking a glass of red wine. The steps lead to the beach and the sea. \nBeatrix steps out onto the porch, and sits down on the steps across from him. \nBetween them the dawn sky breaks. \nBILL Did she go to sleep easy? \nTHE BRIDE It took her a little bit. She was excited. She's quite the little chatterbox. \nBILL Well, if she doesn't like you, you got to kill her to say hello. But if she likes you, you can't shut her up. She's a chip off the ole blonde in that regards. \nHe holds up the bottle of vino. \nBILL Red wine? \nShe shakes her blonde head, no. \nBILL C'mon, Bea, you're a whole lot more fun with a couple glasses of wine in ya. \nShe gives him a look. \nBILL (pointing towards the beach) We're going to go out there and have at it, aren't we? \nShe shakes her blonde head, yes. \nBILL Well, I've already had    a glass. So unless you want to win    by an unfair advantage, you should    have a glass of wine. So we're both    on the same footing wine wise. \nShe holds out the empty glass, and he fills it with red. \nBILL You know, there's an old man down here, his name is Esteban Viharo. He was a pimp. I knew him when I was a child. He was a friend of my mother's. I told him about you. When I showed him your picture he smiles and said; (imitating his accent) \"Yesss, I see the attraction.\" He told me a story about taking me to the movies when I was five. It was a movie which had Lana Turner in it. And whenever she would appear on screen, he said I would stick my thumb in my mouth and suck it, to an obscure amount. And he knew right then, this boy will be a fool for blondes. \nTHE BRIDE Who would of ever thought you'd be such a good father? \nBILL Well not you, that's for damn sure. \nShe gives him another look. \nTHE BRIDE Must we have to endure your little zingers? \nBILL No we mustn't. But if you're going to say sentences like that, in the future, I will resist the temptation. \nTHE BRIDE Baby, you don't have a future. \nBill drinks some wine. \nBILL I sent you to L.A. and you never came back. I thought you'd been killed. Do you know how cruel it is to make someone think someone they love is dead? I mourned you. Then in the third month of my mourning, I track you down. I wasn't trying to track you down, I was trying to track down - the fucking assholes - who I thought killed you. And when I find you, what to I find? Not only are you not dead, you're getting married - to some fuckin jerk - and you're pregnant? How do you expect me to react? \nTHE BRIDE Why do you think I hid? \nBILL Why did you leave in the first place? You have cold eyes towards me now. I understand their temperature, but they were warm the second to the last time I saw them, or was that just my imagination? \nTHE BRIDE No. \nThe Bride decides to tell all. As she tells this story, parts will be shown on the screen. \nTo give herself a running start with the story she starts it off in Japanese; \nTHE BRIDE (JAPANESE) You sent me to L.A. to kill that lady scoundrel, Lisa Wong. \nBill interrupts her. \nBILL (ENGLISH) You are you talking in Japanese? \nThe Bride explodes; \nTHE BRIDE (ENGLISH) What the hell do you care what I talk in? Don't you know when to keep your mouth shut? I'm trying to tell you what you want to know, if you'll just shut up and listen and stop talking! Now may I continue? \nBILL You're right, I'm wrong, continue. \nTHE BRIDE The morning I left, I threw up. I don't feel like speaking in Japanese anymore - on the plane, I threw up. When I got to my hotel, I threw up. So naturally I started thinking, maybe I might be pregnant. So I bought one of those home pregnancy kits. Went back to my room and took the test. The little strip said blue. I was going to have a baby. I tried to call you, but you weren't there, so I just thought I'd call back later. \nBILL But you never did. \nTHE BRIDE - Would you shut up, I'm trying to tell you how I feel. \nBILL My apologies, please continue. \nTHE BRIDE So I just figured I'd call you back later. I was just so happy, I put on music and danced by myself in the hotel suite, holding my little blue strip. What I didn't know, was at some leg of my journey, I was spotted. With me in Los Angeles it didn't take Lisa Wong long to figure out someone put a hit out on her. So she sent an assassin of her own to \nkill me in my hotel room. As I was dancing in euphoria, the killer came down the hall. \nThere's a knock on the hotel room door. \nThe Bride stops dancing and goes to the door's peephole. \nPEEPHOLE POV: A pretty KOREAN WOMAN in the blazer and skirt outfit of a hotel manager. She's holding a basket of flowers. \nThe Bride says through the door; \nTHE BRIDE Hello, can I help you? \nHOTEL WOMAN Hello, I'm Karen Kim, I'm the hospitality manager of the hotel. I have a welcome gift from the management. \nSeeing it through the peephole. \nTHE BRIDE Oh, it's beautiful. But I'm kinda busy at this second, could you possibly come back later? \nAs she talks, she accidentally drops the blue strip, she bends down to pick it up... \nWHEN... \n", "test3_id": 2618}

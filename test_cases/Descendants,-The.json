THE OCEAN - DAY                                              1 \nCLOSE ON a beautiful 40-YEAR-OLD WOMAN at the helm of a powerful SPEEDBOAT -- her hair tossed back by the wind, her mouth in a euphoric grin. \nFADE OUT. \n2   CREDITS -- ARCHIVAL FOOTAGE                                       2 \nMATT (V.O.) My missionary ancestors came to the islands and told the Hawaiians to put on clothes, work hard, believe in Christ, and stop surfing and hula dancing. They made business deals along the way -- buying an island, or marrying a princess and inheriting her land. Now their descendants wear bikinis and running shorts, play beach volleyball and surf, and take up hula dancing. Hawai'i has always been a place of contradiction. \n3   EXT. HONOLULU - DAY                                               3 \nVARIOUS SHOTS of Honolulu begin a pattern of montages to be interspersed throughout the film. \nMATT (V.O.) My friends on the mainland think just because I live in Hawai'i, I live in paradise. Like a permanent vacation -- we're all just out here drinking mai- tais, shaking our hips, and catching waves. Are they nuts? How can they possibly think our families are less screwed up, our heart attacks and cancers less fatal, our grief less devastating? Hell, I haven't been on a surfboard in fifteen years. \n4   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                          4 \nWe ZOOM BACK from a panorama of Honolulu to find 50-year-old MATT KING seated amid DOCUMENTS atop a makeshift desk -- he has brought his work with him. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 4   CONTINUED:                                                          4 \nMATT (V.O.) For the last 23 days, I've been living in a \"paradise\" of IVs and urine bags and endotracheal tubes and six-month- old US magazines. Paradise. Paradise can go fuck itself. \nMatt looks up at the WOMAN we saw in the speedboat, now lying stiffly on an upright HOSPITAL BED, her head cocked to one side, a feeding tube in her nose, a ventilator in her trachea, IVs in her arm. \nMATT (V.O.) (CONT'D) This is Elizabeth King, my wife. Twenty-three days ago she was launched from a powerboat during a race and hit her head, almost drowned. Now she's in a coma that scores 5 on the Glasgow scale and 3 on the Rancho Los Amigos scale, scores showing an extremely severe coma. Liz is very competitive. Whatever she does, she does to the fullest. \n5   INT. NEUROLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY                                     5 \nMatt is getting the current DIAGNOSIS. \nNEUROLOGIST She reacts non-purposefully to stimuli in a non-specific manner, but occasionally her responses are specific, though inconsistent. Her reflexes are primitive and often the same, regardless of stimuli presented... \nMATT (V.O.) It was exactly what Elizabeth used to accuse me of. \n6   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                            6 \nMatt continues to observe her. \nMATT (V.O.) Twenty-three days in a coma, and any day now the doctors will give me their final verdict if she's going to come out of it or not. Then I have a decision to make. Wait, that's wrong. Liz has a living will. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 6   CONTINUED:                                                          6 MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D) Like always, she makes her own decisions. But I know she's going to pull through. \nHis CELLPHONE RINGS. \nMATT (CONT'D) Hi, Noe, what's up? \nNOE (ON PHONE) Matt, you have a call from Scottie's teacher. She says it's urgent. \nMATT Yeah, sure. Put her on. \n7   INT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY                              7 \nA SCRAPBOOK shows PHOTOS OF ELIZABETH lying in her hospital bed. The compositions are odd, the ANGLES uncomfortably CLOSE. \nWIDE -- \nMatt confers with fifth-grade teacher MS. Hayashi and school counselor MRS. THULL. \nMS. HAYASHI We just don't think these photographs are appropriate for Scottie to be sharing with her classmates. Some of them went home quite disturbed, and we got some angry calls from parents. \nMATT Yeah, she's sort of been going to town with the whole picture-taking thing, but I had no idea -- \nMS. HAYASHI I can't tell you how my heart goes out to you and your family, but Scottie just hasn't been herself. Principal Cruz agrees with us that it maybe would be better for Scottie to remain at home with you during this difficult time. \nMATT Home. See, I would think that sticking to her normal routine would be the best thing for her -- you know, keep her occupied. I wouldn't really know how to...

And her sister's away at school on the Big Island. I don't think Scottie would really want to hang out with me when she could be with her friends and people like you who specialize in children. \nMRS. THULL Mr. King, we see this every day -- children acting out at school when something's wrong at home. And your family is facing a devastating crisis. Have you been engaging Scottie in really talking about what's going on? Encouraging her to express her feelings? That's crucial. \nMATT (No) Oh, yeah.   Yeah.   Absolutely. \nSCOTTIE (O.S.) (singing) This shit is bananas. B-a-n-a-n-a-s. This shit is bananas. \nThey look over to see -- \nSCOTTIE I'm starving. And I'm thirsty.          I want a soda. \nHe takes Scottie by the hand and sits her down in a chair next to the bed. \nMATT We're not leaving until you talk to her. I'll even give you privacy. Recite her the alphabet for all I care. What do you want to drink? \nSCOTTIE Sprite. \nMATT OK, Sprite. Diet Sprite? \nSCOTTIE Not diet.    Regular.   Do you think I'm fat? \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 9    CONTINUED: (2)                                                       9 \nMATT No, you're not fat. \nSCOTTIE I'm not the model. \nMATT It's just that all that sugar makes you cranky. \nSCOTTIE I'm not cranky! \nMATT Okay.     I'll be right back.    Talk. \n10   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                          10 \nAs Matt steps out into the hallway, he passes NURSE JOY. \nNURSE JOY Mr. King, how are you? \nMATT Fine, Joy, fine.     And you? \nNURSE JOY I see your picture in the paper today. Have you made your decision yet? \nMATT My decision? \nNURSE JOY Your family. About your big land. \nThe other NURSE nudges Joy to be more polite. \nNURSE JOY (CONT'D) What?     Me and Mr. King, we're like this. \nMATT Well, it's not really my decision. It's my whole family's decision. And furthermore... (mock scolding) ... mind your own business, young lady. \nAs he turns away to continue down the hall -- \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft      4/11/10 Draft 10   CONTINUED:                                                               10 \nMATT (V.O) (CONT'D) The whole goddamned state is following my decision on who's going to buy 35,000 acres on Kaua'i my family has owned since the 1860s. My cousins and I meet in six days to approve a buyer. Ever since my father died nine years ago, I'm the sole trustee, the controlling trustee, so I hold all the cards. Why does so much have to depend on me -- my wife, my daughters, my family's land? I just want to hide. \n11   INT. HOSPITAL GIFT SHOP - DAY                                            11 \nA POSTCARD shows a BEAUTIFUL YOUNG GIRL in a bikini straddling a surfboard, laughing as she's splashed. \nBarely containing his rage, Matt stares at postcard before grabbing ALL THE POSTCARDS in that rack. \nAT THE COUNTER -- \nAbout to pay for the postcards and two SODAS, Matt notices a HEADLINE atop a stack of NEWSPAPERS: \"Activists Continue Protest of Kaua'i Sale.\" \nSHOPKEEPER Hey, they all the same cards.      You like buy all the same cards? \nMATT These are inappropriate for a hospital gift shop. This girl is underage. Why do you sell postcards like this? This is a hospital. These aren't get-well cards. \nThe SHOPKEEPER blinks at the man weirdly accosting her. \nSHOPKEEPER You like buy all the cards?       Or you want I put them back? \nMATT (pulling out his wallet) Never mind. Yes, I'm buying them.          And these two sodas. \nAs she rings him up -- \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 11   CONTINUED:                                                          11 \nSHOPKEEPER Okay, you buy underage girl all for yourself. \nIn the lobby just outside the store, he drops the stack of postcards into the GARBAGE. \n12   INT. HOSPITAL STAIRWAY - DAY                                        12 \nForgoing the elevator -- perhaps to squeeze in a little exercise -- Matt trudges upstairs. \nBARB HIGGINS (O.S.) I don't care about the backstory, Mr. King. My daughter comes home from school in tears. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 17   CONTINUED:                                                           17 \nMATT Yeah, no, I get it.    I'm very sorry. \nBARB HIGGINS (O.S.) Scottie should be the one who's sorry. I want her to come over and apologize to Lani, and I don't ever want her to write to my daughter again. \nLANI (DISTANT O.S.) She can in a good way. \nBARB HIGGINS (O.S.) If she doesn't apologize, I'm going to tell the headmaster. You can't buy your way out of this. \nMatt draws a long exasperated breath, as if everything else weren't enough already. \nMATT (V.O.) See what I mean? Everybody sees me as the rich guy, the inheritor. People resent us. I resent us. Even our last name -- King. How irritating. \n18   INT. MATT'S CAR - DAY                                                18 \nMatt drives Scottie. \nMATT You need to say you're sorry, and you need to mean it. No dicking around. I have a ton of work to do tonight. Do you have any idea how behind I am? You made her cry. Why would you want to be so mean to someone? \nSCOTTIE (irritated) I don't know! \nMATT Is that what you text all the time, nasty things? \nSCOTTIE No. \nMATT Well, what then? \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 18   CONTINUED:                                                          18 \nSCOTTIE I write them with Reina. They make her laugh, and then she shows Megan and Brooke, and they laugh too. \nMATT I should have known Reina had something to do with it. I don't want you hanging out with her. \nSCOTTIE Wait, I told Reina she could visit me in the hospital since I'm not in school anymore. Can she? \nMATT We'll make a deal. You apologize to this girl, and you talk to your mother, and then we'll see about Reina dropping by the hospital. Okay? \nSomething outside the window catches Scottie's attention. \nSCOTTIE Dorks! \nMatt looks to see -- \nSIX FAMILY MEMBERS, walking on the sidewalk with KAYAKS, wearing T-SHIRTS reading \"Melnick Family Reunion.\" \nSCOTTIE (CONT'D) Dorks! \nMATT Scottie, knock it off! \nScottie sits back in her seat, laughing. Matt glances in his rearview mirror to see a TEENAGE SON taking off his T-shirt and throwing it to the ground. \n19   EXT. LANI'S HOUSE - KAIMUKI - LATE AFTERNOON                        19 \nThe car drives down a block of MODEST HOMES. \nSCOTTIE Her house is down there on the corner. \nMATT You've been here before? \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft    4/11/10 Draft 19   CONTINUED:                                                           19 \nSCOTTIE Yea-uh. She invites me to her birthday, like, every year. \nMATT So you guys are actually friends? \nSCOTTIE Until last year's party, when she locked me out of the house and I had to sit outside all day while everybody was inside. She thought she was so great, but then I became friends with Reina and Brooke and got popular. \nMATT (processing) What? \n20   EXT. LANI'S FRONT PORCH - LATE AFTERNOON                             20 \nBARB HIGGINS answers the door. \nBARB HIGGINS Thank you for coming by. \n21   INT. LANI'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS                                       21 \nAs Matt and Scottie are shown inside, they remove their shoes. \nVERY CLOSE ON MATT -- \nMATT (V O.) (CONT'D) I just want to be a normal guy. \n24   EXT. DOWNTOWN HONOLULU - DAY                                         24 \nEstablishing -- tall buildings, business people, lunch wagons. The Descendants     PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft \n25   INT. MATT'S LAW OFFICE - DAY                                      25 \nMatt eats a SACK LUNCH at his desk. His window has a grand view of DOWNTOWN. We glimpse his Punahou, college and law school DIPLOMAS. \nMATT (V.O.) Unlike a lot of my cousins, I haven't touched my share of the trust money. Like my father before me, I live only on the income from my law practice. I don't want my daughters growing up entitled and spoiled. And I agree with my father -- you give your children enough money to do something but not enough to do nothing. \nMatt's secretary NOE cracks open his door. \nNOE Mr. King, your cousins are here. \n26   INT. LAW OFFICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                             26 \nMatt enters the room to find SEVEN COUSINS waiting to greet him. From their casual clothing and shaggy hair, an observer might hardly suspect their status. \nMATT (V.O.) Not only am I the sole but I'm a commercial real estate and transactional attorney, so the most involved of my cousins have been meeting with me regularly to analyze the bids -- Cousin Dave, Cousin Hal, Cousin Six, Cousin Wink, Cousin Lisa, Cousin Connie and Cousin Stan, both of whom oppose the sale entirely. Don't be fooled by appearances. In Hawai'i some of the most powerful people look like bums and stuntmen. \nLATER -- \nMatt and his cousins stand above the conference table, looking at blueprints and architectural drawings. \nMATT (V.O.) (CONT'D) The proposals are virtually the same -- hotels, shopping centers, condos and golf courses. 3000 new jobs in the first five years. Support letters from the construction industry and unions.

(CONT'D) A Chicago group is offering half a billion dollars, but we're leaning toward a lower bid from a guy named Don Holitzer. He's actually from Kaua'i and made a fortune in Silicon Valley. Cousin Hugh is pushing us in that direction, and I say why not? \nCLOSE ON MATT, nodding along but highly distracted, the sound of Liz's VENTILATOR growing louder in his brain. \nWe CUT TO ARTIST'S RENDERINGS of comatose Elizabeth -- wide, closer, closer still, closer. \n27   EXT. QUEENS'S HOSPITAL - DAY                                          27 \nEstablishing.       Matt walks inside the front door. \n28   INT. FAMILY CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY                                   28 \nMatt sits across from old family friend DR. SAM JOHNSTON. \nDR. JOHNSTON Bad news, Matt. Dr. Chun, Dr. Mueller and I -- we believe her condition,                            * which we call a multi-factorial anoxic                        * encephalopathy, is deteriorating. We                          * see no eye movement, no pupillary                             * response, basically no brainstem                              * reflexes whatsoever. The machines                             * could keep her going, but her quality                         * of life would be... very poor.                                * Basically what you see now. She'll never be like she was, Matt. Never.                           * We know that now. \nMatt sits very still. \nDR. JOHNSTON (CONT'D) I can't tell you how sorry I am to have to tell you this. And you have your daughters. There's just nothing we can do. \nMATT So... if we do go ahead and take her off the machines -- \nDR. JOHNSTON Not if, Matt. When. I have a legal obligation. You know that. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 28   CONTINUED:                                                          28 \nMATT How long will she last? \nDR. JOHNSTON Hard to say. Could be a few days. Could be two weeks. But for planning purposes, you should work off the shortest possible scenario. I know I need to get the ball rolling on organ donations right away. \nOrgan donation?     Forgot about that one. \nDR. JOHNSTON (CONT'D) Elizabeth has so many friends, a big life. Last time I was at your house, must have been 200 people. If you're going to let people know to say goodbye, which is fairly typical protocol in these situations, start now. By the time the last day comes, they feel more ready, as ready as they can feel. I'm so sorry, Matt. \n29   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                         29 \nHis mind spinning, Matt prepares to look at the corpse-to-be. When he opens the door and pulls back the curtain, he finds -- \n30   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     30 \n-- friends MARK AND KAI MITCHELL up for a visit. They're playing MUSIC for Elizabeth on a mini-boombox, and Kai is APPLYING MAKE-UP to Liz's face. \nAfter cheery greetings -- \nMATT What're you doing? \nKAI Oh, she's been looking a little pale lately all cooped up in here, and I just know she'd be mortified if no one had thought to help her out with some lipstick and blush. I know she'll grill me. \nMatt and Mark exchange a look -- \"Girls.\" \nMARK And of course Kai's getting her all caught up on all the latest gossip. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 30   CONTINUED:                                                          30 \nSCOTTIE Just because her hand moved, it doesn't mean anything, Troy. Mom twitches at weird times.

Matt follows, not even gracing Troy with a final look. \n34    EXT. OCEAN OUTRIGGER POOL - CONTINUOUS                               34 \nMatt catches up to Scottie. \nMATT Hey, sport, don't pay any attention to that guy. That guy's a dope. \nSCOTTIE I hate him. \nMATT Yeah. \nSCOTTIE I didn't mean to say dead chicken. I don't want Mom to die. \nMATT I know, I know. Hey, let's get out of here. Let's go do something crazy. Like let's drive to the airport and hop over to the Big Island and surprise your sister. What do you say? \nSCOTTIE Right now? \nMATT It'll be fun. She's not expecting us or anything. And we bring her home. I think she should be here with us, don't you? Don't you miss her? I miss her. \nSCOTTIE Yeah, I'm out of school.       She should be too! \n35    EXT. OUTRIGGER RESTAURANT - DAY                                      35 \nAs Matt and Scottie head toward the exit, Scottie FLIPS OFF a crestfallen Troy. \nA35   EXT.

Somehow it feels natural to find a daughter of mine on a different island. A family seems exactly like an archipelago -- all part of the same geographic expression but still islands -- separate and alone, always drifting slowly apart. \n38   EXT.

The TV is on in the background. \nMATT Hi, sorry to bother you.       I'm Matt King. \nDORM SUPERVISOR Yes, hello, Mr. King. \nMATT I've come to pick up my daughter, Alexandra. \nDORM SUPERVISOR Did you call Administration? \nMATT No, I didn't.

(no answer) Does Mom let you have Coke for breakfast? \nALEXANDRA I'm pretty sure it's after eleven. \nNow that we get a closer look, we might recognize Alexandra from the postcards at the hospital. We also see a resemblance to her mother. \nMATT How are you feeling? \nShrugging, she plops down near Scottie. \nMATT (CONT'D) Hungover, huh? Why am I not surprised? I don't know where to start, and we probably shouldn't in front of Scottie. \nSCOTTIE I don't mind. \nMATT I thought you were supposed to be getting your act together. \nALEXANDRA I have gotten my act together. I was just drinking. I've been doing really well, but nobody ever seems to notice my grades are better, and how I was in that stupid play you guys didn't bother to see. Do you even remember the name of it? \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 48   CONTINUED: (2)                                                      48 \nIt's on the tip of his tongue. \nALEXANDRA (CONT'D) That's what I thought. So what if I got drunk on the ONE night you happened to drop in? So the fuck what? \nMATT Hey, hey, hey. Watch your language in front of Scottie. \nSCOTTIE I'm okay. \nMATT (sitting with them) Anyway, it's good to see you.      Welcome home. Want some eggs? \nALEXANDRA How long do I have to stay? \nMATT We'll discuss that. \nALEXANDRA (getting up) I'm going swimming. \nMATT Then I'll join you. \nALEXANDRA Good times. \n49   EXT.

We were in school together for years. \nALEXANDRA I can't drop it. \nMATT You have to. \nALEXANDRA You really don't have a clue, do you? Dad, she was cheating on you. \nWhoa. \nALEXANDRA (CONT'D) That's what we fought about. When I was home at Christmas, I caught her with some guy. It made me sick to see her near you. I went back to school thinking that was it, I was done with her. I was going to call and tell you everything. But then the accident happened, and I was waiting until she woke up, I guess. And you, you didn't even suspect. Right? (off his silence) That disgusted me too. You're always so busy. \nMATT Caught her with some guy?    What does that mean? \nALEXANDRA Brandy and I were on our way to swim in the Black Point pool, and suddenly I see Mom and some douchebag walk into a house. His house, I guess. \nMATT Just a guy? It could have been anybody. \nALEXANDRA He had his hand on her ass.      It was gross. \nMATT You're sure it was her.

She went into the house. A few days later I told her I knew what she was doing. \nMATT And? \nALEXANDRA First she acted like she didn't know what I was talking about. Like I'm blind. Then she got super-mad and started yelling at me and denied it. That's when I decided I didn't want anything more to do with her. \nMATT Who is he? \nALEXANDRA I don't know. Some guy. \nMATT What did he look like? \nALEXANDRA Dark hair. \nMatt stands up, walks in a little circle -- he literally does not know which way to turn.

Come on in. Want a drink? Want some coffee? \nMATT (shaking his head) What were you fighting about? \nMARK Stupid. \nKAI It's not stupid. He wants us to throw parties and have people over, which we do, of course, but who ends up doing all the work? Me. \nMARK It's work that's totally unnecessary. You don't have to do anything. Nobody's forcing you to clean and buy a new outfit and think of some goddamn theme cocktail. We can just invite people over last minute and drink whatever we have and hang out. It's more fun that way, anyway. \nAs they continue their argument, Matt is struck by the pettiness of everyday life. He at once pities it, is impatient with it, and longs for it. \nMARK (CONT'D) You know what? We can talk about it later.

(to Scottie) Auntie Esther will come over to watch you. \nALEXANDRA Sid's coming with us, okay? \nMATT Sid, this week, what's going on, is a real family matter. You understand.

Alex seated at his feet. Every so often a PET PARROT squawks loudly. \nSCOTT THORSON This is like reading Korean. \nMATT Scott, I'll be happy to walk you through it. \nSCOTT THORSON (tossing the papers) Jibber-jabber. \nMATT It's an advanced directive -- basically her instructions on what medical procedures she wants or, in this case, does not want. No prolonged mechanical ventilation, no -- \nSCOTT THORSON I know goddamn well what it says. Says she doesn't want everyone waiting around while she spoils like milk. Says if the doctors can't do squat, she'd just as soon get on with it. \nHe stares off into space. \nALEXANDRA Gramps, are you okay? \nSCOTT THORSON Elizabeth had the good sense to write this thing here. Always a thoughtful girl. A strong girl. A hell of a lot stronger than her brother. Barry whines his way through life. Might even be a homosexual, for all I know. \nMATT Yeah, Scott, I don't think so. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants         PINK Shooting Draft    4/11/10 Draft 59   CONTINUED:                                                            59 \nSCOTT THORSON And she's stronger than you, Matt. She lived more in a year than you did in a decade, sitting in your office, hoarding all your cash. All that money you refuse to use -- what the hell good is it? And now you and your family are cashing in your chips -- what the hell for? Maybe if you'd let my baby have her own boat and bought her some safe equipment or let her go on those shopping sprees women like, maybe she wouldn't have gone in for those thrill sports. Maybe if you'd provided more thrills at home. \nALEXANDRA Grandpa. \nSCOTT THORSON And you, Alexandra. Putting your poor mother through hell when all she was trying to do was instill some sense and drive in you. Shame on you. You should try to be more like her. She's a good girl. She's a good girl. \nThe old man climbs to his feet and takes a few steps away. Hands on hips, he looks up as though gauging the weather. Then he clears his throat, wipes his face with his sleeve, turns back. \nSCOTT THORSON (CONT'D) You all want a drink? \nAs he wanders away toward the kitchen -- \nLATER -- \nScott returns pushing a little DRINK-CART. Behind him trails his wife ALICE. An Alzheimer's victim, Alice is a sweet woman, alert but unable to grasp or recall. \nALICE Oh, do we have guests? \nMATT (kissing her) Hi, Alice. Good to see you.       It's me, Matt. \nALEXANDRA You suck, Sid. \nSID Speaking of retarded, do you ever feel bad for wishing a retarded person or an old person would just hurry up? Sometimes I wait for them to cross the street, and I'm like, come on already! But then I feel bad. \nRather than lashing out again at Sid, Matt turns around and lowers his head into one hand, squeezing his temples. It's all getting to be too much for him. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 60    CONTINUED: (2)                                                       60 \nALEXANDRA (noticing his anguish) Dad? \nMATT What? \nALEXANDRA Don't forget -- I know where he lives. \nMatt thinks a moment, then -- \nMATT Get in the front seat. \n61-63 OMIT                                                            61-63 \n64    EXT.

Yo, Matt King! \nMatt turns to see COUSIN RALPH loping over, briefcase in hand. Like Matt, he wears the island businessman's uniform -- Khakis and a Reyn's Spooner shirt. \nGrinning and nodding, Cousin Ralph gives Matt a back-slap hug and greets Scottie and Alexandra, whose names he clearly forgets. \nCOUSIN RALPH (CONT'D) Whatcha doing here? \nMATT Just came over for a day or two. \nCOUSIN RALPH Yeah, I just got back from Kahului.    A little business over there. \nMATT Yeah. \nCOUSIN RALPH All right. So you here to talk to some of the cousins? Make sure everybody's happy with your choice? Pay your respects to Cousin Hugh? \nMatt's smiles to cover the fact that he hasn't actually been thinking about this stuff. \nMATT No, no, nothing like that. Just a little holoholo. Get the kids out of town. \nCOUSIN RALPH But it is Holitzer, right? We all know it's Holitzer. Cousin Hugh wants him, they go way back. I got my misgivings, though. It's not the highest bid by a longshot.

We only do this once in a lifetime. And in this economy -- \nMATT Yeah, no, I know. I want to work with you guys, Ralph, I really do. Whatever the majority wants, I'll go along with it. Let's just get it over with. \nCOUSIN RALPH How's Elizabeth doing?     She going to be okay? \nMATT The same. \nCOUSIN RALPH Well, she's a tough gal. She'll be okay. Yeah. Say, where you going, Hanalei? \nMATT Yeah, Princeville. \nCOUSIN RALPH Come on.    I'll give you a ride. \n83   EXT.

The passengers hold on, their hair blown back. \nMATT Hey, Ralph. \nCOUSIN RALPH Yeah. \nMATT Turn off over here.     Let's go see the land. \nCOUSIN RALPH Take a last look, huh? \nMATT You got time? \nCOUSIN RALPH I got nothing but time. The Descendants     PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft \n84   EXT.

All get out, walk to the edge, look out. \nSID Are you shitting me?   You guys own all this land? \nMATT Not personally. It belongs to a trust. But yeah, it's ours for a few more days. \nRALPH The other side of that ridge too. You can't see it from here. It's like this, but a little flatter and doesn't have as nice a bay. \nSID This is outrageous. \nCOUSIN RALPH (pointing, to Matt) Yep. Big resort there on that point. Commercial area over there, houses all through there. I think they should put in a big zip-line. Hell, we should have put in a zip-line. \nAll continue to ogle this awe-inspiring sight. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft      4/11/10 Draft 87   CONTINUED:                                                             87 \nAlex shoots him a look, then stamps out the butt on the bottom of her shoe. \nMATT (CONT'D) You could at least smoke lights.       Like Sid. \nALEXANDRA I could. \nMATT Just got off the phone with Dr. Johnston. They did what they had to do a couple hours ago. They've moved her to another floor. They say she seems comfortable, still breathing on her own. She's doing okay. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 93   CONTINUED:                                                          93 \nAlexandra nods at this news and looks off.       Matt joins her in gazing out at Hanalei Bay. \nMATT (CONT'D) So how are you doing, Alex? \nALEXANDRA What do you mean? You mean considering Mom's... circling the drain? \nMATT No, I mean other than that. In general. You haven't been using, have you? \nALEXANDRA No, Jesus, I'm not using. \nMATT Not at all? I smell pot all the time on Sid. \nALEXANDRA That's Sid. \nMATT So you just stopped?   Really? \nALEXANDRA Look, Dad, it's no big deal. Kids do drugs and they stop. Unless they're like super-ghetto. And you sent me to boarding school, remember? I couldn't get anything anymore. So no, I'm not doing any drugs. But I still think they're fun. Okay, maybe a little pot once in a while. \nMATT And a little drinking. \nShe can't deny that. \nMATT (CONT'D) Why are you being so honest? \nALEXANDRA Mom's dying. \nMATT Yeah, well, I'm proud of you. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants     PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 93   CONTINUED: (2)                                                    93 \nALEXANDRA Not much to be proud of. \nMATT Yeah, there is. We shipped you off. Let them handle it. And now you're here, helping with Scottie, helping me. Thanks. \nALEXANDRA You want to know what really pisses me off? That she wouldn't end it. Not even when she knew she was busted. How are we supposed to feel about that? \nMATT I guess she really liked him. \nALEXANDRA So how are we going to find this guy, Sherlock? \nMATT Right. Well, why don't you two take Scottie to the beach? I'm going to call around a little. We're on an island, for Christ's sake. Everything's just one degree of separation. \nALEXANDRA (getting up) We'll find him. \n94   EXT. ST. REGIS BEACH - DAY                                        94 \nMatt scans the BEACH as he ambles toward Sid and his daughters lying on towels. Scottie is snuggled close to Sid. \nMatt notices LUMPS OF SAND stuffed into Scottie's bikini top. \nMATT Hey, what's in your suit? \nSCOTTIE They're my beach boobs. \nMATT Take that out. Right now. Alex, Jesus, why'd you let her do that?    You too, Sid. \nLying on her stomach, Alex lifts her head. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants         PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 94   CONTINUED:                                                            94 \nALEXANDRA I don't know. Take them out, stupid. \nSID Yeah, Scottie. Honestly.       Big boobs look kind of fatty. \nScowling, Scottie gets up and starts pulling the sand out of her suit as she stomps toward the water. \nALEXANDRA Any luck? \nMATT The hotels were a dead end, but I took another shot with his office. He's definitely in Hanalei renting a house somewhere -- probably one of those cottages around the bay. Who wants to go for a walk? \nSID Sounds good. \nMatt watches the little boys flop into the surf.        Mrs. Speer follows, wading in up to her calves. \nMatt stands to look whether Brian is coming down to the beach too. No such luck. \nMATT (CONT'D) (to Alex) I'll be right back. \nMatt gets to his feet, brushes off sand, and walks casually toward Mrs. Speer, maintaining a comfortable distance. Alexandra watches. \nIN THE SURF -- \nMatt takes up a casual stance near Mrs. Speer and pretends to look out at the water, just hanging out. Mrs. Speer continues to keep a watchful eye on her boisterous boys. \nMATT (CONT'D) Looks like you got yourself a handful with those two. \nJULIE Yeah. \nMATT Must keep you pretty busy. \nJULIE They're pretty non-stop, but they're at a really fun age. \nMATT How old are they? \nJULIE SPEER Eight and ten. \nMATT (pointing) I have two girls. Ten and seventeen. That whole non-stop thing. That never changes. \nJULIE SPEER You guys live here? \nMATT We live on O'ahu. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 104   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   104 \nJULIE SPEER Oh, so do we. \nMATT Yeah, I'm just getting my girls out of town for a couple days. Their, uh, their mother is in the hospital, so I thought I'd give them a little break. \nJULIE Oh, no. \nMATT She'll be fine. \nJULIE What's wrong? If you don't mind my asking. \nMATT Just a little boating accident.       Hit her head a little too hard. \nDoes Julie recognize any of this, or even recognize him? Doesn't seem like it. \nJULIE A sailboat? Or one with a motor? \nMATT (laughs, then --) One with a motor. \nShe's actually sort of charming, this Julie Speer. \nJULIE Well, good luck with that. I wish her well. Skylar, don't go so far! \nMATT You guys staying in one of the cottages over there? \nJULIE Yes, my husband had to come here for work, so we thought we'd all make a little vacation of it. He knows the owner, so -- \nMATT Hugh King. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 104   CONTINUED: (3)                                                    104 \nJULIE That's right. \nMATT He's my cousin. \nJULIE Oh. Then you probably know my husband. Brian Speer? \nThat hangs there a moment.      Matt suppresses the sudden desire to spill the beans. \nMATT No, can't say as I do. \nJULIE Oh, I just assumed, since he's been -- \nSCOTTIE Dad!     Dad, come here!   Something bit me! \nMatt looks over to see Scottie very agitated about something. \nMATT Excuse me.     Nice talking to you. \nJULIE You too.    Take care. \nALEXANDRA Do you need help? \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 109   CONTINUED: (3)                                                  109 \nJULIE (over her shoulder) No, no, I got it. \nAlex is glad to keep her ringside seat for the moment.       All buckle their mental seatbelts. \nMATT Elizabeth is dying. Oh, wait. Fuck you. And she's dying. We unhooked her from the machines this morning. She'll be dead in a few days. \nALEXANDRA We're not here to hurt you. We just thought she'd want you to know. \nAs they've plotted, Alex and Matt study Brian's paralyzed face. They exchange a glance, then look back at him. \nALEXANDRA (CONT'D) This is him? Why would she go for him? \nMATT Beats me.    Well, he's very articulate. \nBRIAN SPEER I can't... I'm sorry. I never thought it would come to this. \nALEXANDRA You're sorry my mom's going to die? You're sorry you fucked her? You're sorry you fucked over my dad? \nBRIAN SPEER I'm sorry for all of it. \nMATT Look, pal, like she said, I'm not here to wreck your life. I just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital. I don't know how long you're planning on being here, but I'm sure you can think of an excuse to leave. \nALEXANDRA You must be good at that. \nMATT You can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want. Do you hear what I'm saying? \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants      PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 109   CONTINUED: (4)                                                 109 \nBrian seems deeply lost in his own thoughts.     Then -- \nBRIAN SPEER Okay, look, I can't have you here.     You understand. \nJulie returns with wine for Matt and a soda for Alex. \nJULIE Here we go. (noticing) Everyone's so serious. Please don't tell me you're talking about business. \nALEXANDRA We're talking about love. \nJULIE That's nice. Brian, call the boys in for dinner. \nBRIAN SPEER They're fine. Let them play a while longer. \nThey all stand there a moment. Matt's unsure how to play this out. He shoots a quick panicked look at Alex, who scrambles to keep the ball rolling. \nALEXANDRA Awesome cottage you're renting. \nMATT Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location. I used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental. Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian built it back in the 20s. Haven't been inside in years. \nJULIE Come on.   We'll give you a tour. \nALEXANDRA Or, Brian, maybe you could give my dad a little walk down memory lane, and Julie and I can chat out here. \nMATT Yeah, I'd like that, if you don't mind.

I'm curious. \nFor a moment Brian looks tricked, as if Matt really did just want a tour of the house. \nBRIAN SPEER I can't do this. \nMATT Neither can I.    How did you meet? \nBRIAN SPEER I thought you said you came here just to tell me. \nMATT I changed my mind. And I can't very well ask her the details. How'd you meet? \nSID Was he sorry? I hope he was sorry, man. You could have told his wife, and you didn't. I hope he knows how lucky he is. I would have told her everything. She deserves to know. Or else she's going to be a dumb bitch the rest of her life. \nALEXANDRA Sid. \nSID I'm just saying. \nMATT No need to get creepy. Anyway, doesn't matter. That's all behind us. \nALEXANDRA Yeah, the one we have to worry about telling things to now is Scottie. \nMATT I've asked Dr. Johnston to help us break the news tomorrow. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants       PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 112   CONTINUED:                                                       112 \nThey turn to look at little Scottie, dead to the world in the window seat. \n113   INT.

HERMAN, who affects a comforting smile. \nDR. JOHNSTON Hello, everyone. Matt. (off their greetings) This is Dr. Herman, whom I told you about. She works with us in counseling. \nDR. HERMAN (locking eyes with all) Hello, everyone. Hello. Hi.      Hello. \nThe two professionals allow the Kings to turn their attention to Elizabeth, who now lies with no machines at all. Around her BALLOONS droop, FLOWERS wilt, get-well CARDS lie in a pile. Elizabeth too is wilting and drooping. Her skin is pasty, and her cheeks are hollow. \nSCOTTIE How come Mom isn't on any more machines? Is she getting better? \nThe adults exchange glances.     Dr. Herman approaches Scottie. \nDR. HERMAN You must be Scottie. (off her nod --) Scottie, I have a present for you. \nDr. Herman hands her a little squeaky RUBBER OCTOPUS she pulls from her pocket. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants           PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 114   CONTINUED:                                                          114 \nDR. HERMAN (CONT'D) That's right. It's an octopus. Such a funny creature with its eight legs. But did you know octopi are actually extremely intelligent, like dogs and cats? They have unique personalities, and just like us they have a lot of defense mechanisms. I'm sure you know about the ink sac. She uses ink to confuse her predators. She can camouflage herself. She can emit poison, and some can mimic more dangerous creatures, like the eel. I keep her to remind me of our defense mechanisms -- our ink, our camouflage, our poison, all the things we use to keep away hurt. The reason Dr. Johnston invited me here today is to meet you, Scottie. I've heard a lot about you. \nSCOTTIE Like what? \nDR. HERMAN I've heard that you're a wonderful and unique and spirited girl. \nDr. Herman shoots a look at Matt before continuing. \nDR. HERMAN (CONT'D) And I've heard your mom's not doing too well and that she's going to die very soon. \nAll watch Scottie react to this news. \nSCOTTIE Dad, is that true? \nMATT Yes, Scottie. It's true. \nDR. HERMAN You're going to have to be a very brave girl right now, and you're surrounded by people who love you. I came to meet you and tell you that if you ever want to talk about what you're feeling, I would like to talk to you too. I can help you face what's going on without all the silly defense mechanisms that work for an octopus but not for us. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 114   CONTINUED: (2)                                                   114 \nDR. JOHNSTON Okay.    Thank you, Dr. Herman. \nDr. Herman looks at everyone with great sincerity before leaving. Scottie is left holding the octopus. She drops it, and it squeaks a little. \nALEXANDRA What the fuck was that? \nDR. JOHNSTON Yes, well, they say she's very good one- on-one. \nSCOTTIE So Mom's going to die for sure? \nDR. JOHNSTON Yes. We worked really hard with her, but three other doctors and I agree she's in what we call an irreversible coma. Do you know what that means? \nSCOTTIE It means she doesn't have a brain anymore. \nDR. JOHNSTON Not exactly, but... yes, that's the general idea. So we're doing exactly what she wanted us to do if that ever happened. That's why she's not attached to the machines anymore. \nALEXANDRA It's for the best, Scottie. Look at her. She's not happy like this. \nMATT She wasn't even driving! Her boat, someone else's boat -- it wouldn't have made any difference. You're not going to blame me for this. \nSCOTT THORSON Sure, sure, quibble about the details. She was a faithful, devoted wife. She deserved more. \nWhy fight it? \nMATT You're right. She deserved more. \nSID For Christ's sake, take it easy on the man. \nScott turns to Sid like he's about to pop him again. \nALEXANDRA My father has been doing a really amazing job under the circumstances. \nHis point made, Scott looks at Matt and the girls and shuffles to Elizabeth's bedside, puts his hands on Alice's shoulder. \n(CONTINUED) The Descendants        PINK Shooting Draft   4/11/10 Draft 115   CONTINUED: (3)                                                    115 \nALICE Are we ready to go? \nBARRY THORSON No, Mom.

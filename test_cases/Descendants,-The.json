Hey, boss. \nMatt looks up to see Sid in his boxers. \nSID (CONT'D) Did you call him? \nMATT None of your business. And put some clothes on. And you're not sleeping in Alex's room. In fact, you should really go home, son. \nSID Alex wouldn't like that. \nMATT Guest room.

He looks at his wife. She's starting to look different -- her face more gaunt, her hair more matted. \nSince the last time we saw her, OTHER ITEMS have been added around her bed. Along with draped LEIS, we see a childhood DOLL, DIPLOMAS, and of course SPORTS MEDALS and RIBBONS. An antique QUILT covers her legs. Her father meant it when he said they'd bring her old things. \nMatt crouches down bedside. \nMATT You were going to ask me for a divorce? So you could be with some fucking fuckhead Brian Speer?

I shouldn't be around second-hand smoke. \nMATT (raising his hand) Now! \nAs Scottie runs outside -- \nALEXANDRA Did you just spank me? \nMATT You have no right to talk to your mother that way. She's going to die in a few days. What if those were your last words? \nALEXANDRA I have every right to speak this way. I'm mad at her. How can you be so forgiving? \nMatt considers this.

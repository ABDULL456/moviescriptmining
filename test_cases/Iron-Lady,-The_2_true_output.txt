DENIS (O.S) You sure? 
The swipe of a clothes brush, briefly seen, drawn across one sleeve- 
MARGARET Yes. 
Distant footsteps- 
MARGARET (CONT'D) ...Definitely the grey. 
JUNE returns, oblivious- 
DENIS (O.S) Righty ho. Boss knows best. 
JUNE spies the newspaper, sees the photos of twisted carnage on the front page. 
DENIS (CONT'D) Don't let her take my paper away. 
JUNE reaches one hand out to scoop it up in passing- 
MARGARET Oh, I haven't had a chance to look at that yet, dear. 
JUNE Sorry. 
JUNE hesitates, leaves the newspaper resting on the bed as she heads off with the suit on a hanger. 
DENIS Atta-girl. 
DENIS smiles as he stands in the bathroom doorway, soaping his face with shaving cream- 
He hums to himself as he resumes shaving until- 
DENIS (O.S) (CONT'D) Damn. 
MARGARET looks up, DENIS has nicked his chin- 
MARGARET Blot it...Blot it.. 
She turns, sees JUNE, through the ajar door, standing in the corridor, looking back at her 
JUNE Sorry ? 
INT. DRAWING ROOM. CHESTER SQUARE. LONDON. PRESENT. DAY. 
A comfortable drawing room, filled with the photographs and memorabilia of a former political life. 
MARGARET stands by the window, half a dozen of DENIS' ties in her hand. Pulling back the net curtain, MARGARET peers out- 
Two POLICEMAN stand down below next to a Police BMW car. They are lost in conversation, pointing to the door, clearly concerned. 
One POLICE MAN nods to the other, a sense of the changing of the guard as he drives off in the BMW. 
SUDDENLY from behind- 
DENIS Now look what you've done. Are they to keep the loonies out or you in? 
MARGARET eyes DENIS, looking at her with wry smile - 
DENIS (CONT'D) I'll be off then.

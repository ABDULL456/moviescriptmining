Racine tries for a moment, then gives up with a laugh. 
MATTY Here! 
Matty opens the door of the Stingray and sits in the passenger seat with her legs out. She rolls up the window in that door as Racine stands before it. The glass capture the moonlight to make a perfect mirror. As the window goes up, Racine's reflection appears on the glass, posing in his hat. At the same time, Matty's face disappears from view.

INT. RACINE'S OFFICE - DAY 
Racine lies on the couch. He spins the fedora Matty gave him on his finger, Beverly comes up and leans against the doorjamb. She's wearing a tee-shirt and tight slacks; she looks good. She watches him for a moment. 
BEVERLY Big weekend planned? 
RACINE Nope, Small weekend. Tiny little weekend. 
BEVERLY There's jazz tonight at the beach... if you're not doing anything... 
RACINE Beverly, do yourself a big favor and forget it. 
BEVERLY Forget what? 
RACINE Whatever you're thinking. 
She shrugs.. She turns back to her desk, unconvinced. 
INT. BAR - NIGHT 
Busy weekend crowd. Racine sits drinking alone at the bar. He signals for another. 
EXT. STREET IN FRONT OF WALKER PLACE - NIGHT 
Racine drives slowly by, head craning to peer into the darkness. We begin to HEAR the thumping again -- 
EXT. THE PIER - DAY 
Racine has been running. Walking now,  breathing hard, he takes his cigarettes from his shorts.  At the end of the pier he folds his body over the rail  so that it looks as though he will topple over the edge.  But he does not; he lights up and looks down there. 
RACINE'S POV. The water following against the thick pilings. Then, TILTING UP, UP, AND OVER, past the ocean's horizon to the perfect blue sky, which fills the screen. 
Racine is looking straight up, blowing his own clouds.

INT. RACINE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Racine lies smoking in bed, bathed in sweat, a beer nearby. A fan is pointed at him, but it's blowing hot air. He looks at the telephone. 
EXT. PORCH OF RACINE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Fog. Thick and heavy. Racine's cigarette glows in it as he sits in the gray limbo. The phone in the apartment RINGS. 
INT. RACINE'S APARTMENT 
Racine comes in from the porch and picks up the phone. 
RACINE Yeah. 
MATTY (filtered) Come to me. 
RACINE Did you tell him? 
MATTY (filtered, after a pause) No... I couldn't. 
Racine's face relaxes. He looks relieved. 
RACINE Okay, I'm coming. 
EXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH - WALKER PLACE - NIGHT 
Same thick fog. The wind chimes TINKLE softly. Light seeps out from Matty's bedroom windows, half-revealing Racine and Matty lying together on a lounge. Matty is in her white terrycloth robe, Racine just shorts. 
RACINE How do you know? 
MATTY I saw the will once. He showed it to me. He was trying to prove something ... how much he loved me or something. 
RACINE How'd he get so fat?

MATTY The stock market, investments, real estate. He doesn't tell me anything, but I've picked up a little. I know they own a lot of land along the shore here. 
RACINE Who's "they"' 
MATTY (she doesn't know) He's never introduced me to anyone. I'm not sure if they're all legitimate. 
RACINE (snorts at the odds of that) I wonder what they call themselves. Maybe I've heard of them. 
MATTY They own that old place in Miranda Beach, The Breakers... I know that. 
RACINE (surprised) The Breakers? I thought Hermie Fisher owned that land.

Boone opens his drawers and pulls out photographs, his passport etc and starts to make a pile with them. He pours lighter fuel on the pictures, and watches them burn. Sitting against the wall still sweating he takes some more pills. 
We see Lori's love letters burn and hear her voice speaking the words as they are consumed. 
Boone cries. Then he hears Lori's voice say: 
LORI: Boone... 
Lori is sitting on the edge of the bed. Boone looks round, sees himself against the wall and moves forward past the real Boone towards the bed... 
Boone watches as he and Lori make love on the bed. We close in on the love-making. Lori leans to kiss him. 
BOONE: I'll never leave you... 
Cut back to boone, his face all grief. 
BOONE: Stupid. 
CUT TO: 
40B. INT. BOONE'S BATHROOM AFTERNOON 
Boone's hand pulls the shower curtain aside and turns on the water. The water pours on him. 
41. HALLUCINATION 
Another of the murder scenes comes to life. Corpses pulse with hideous animation. 
42. INT. BOONE'S BATHROOM AFTERNOON 
With a cry Boone slides to the shower floor, panting, haunted, destroyed. 
BOONE [faintly]: ...I did it...I did it all... 
43. INT. BOONE'S APARTMENT EVENING 
Behind him, the last of the fire flickers. He looks through the blinds at the sunset. Takes another pill. Puts on his leather jacket. Exits. The door slams. 
44. SCENE DELETED 
45. INT. NIGHTCLUB NIGHT 
Lori is on stage, sexy, vivacious, fronting a tight C & W band in a hip rendition of 'Johnny Be Angry'. 
46. INT. NIGHTCLUB NIGHT 
Lori's P.O.V. looking though the crowd in front of the stage. Lori spots Boone standing near the entrance, his face in shadow. 
Her eyes light up with joy as the song builds to climax. It ends. Applause, cat whistles, foot stomping. Lori's in heaven. She looks out again. 
Boone is gone. 
47. EXT. HIGHWAY NIGHT 
Boone steps into view by the side of the road, watches the traffic. 
INTERCUT: 
48. INT. NIGHTCLUB CORRIDOR NIGHT 
Confused and worried, Lori stands in the empty corridor, a note Boone has left for her in her hand. 
Boone edges out closer to the road. Spots a huge semi with a fully loaded trailer barrelling down towards him. 
Lori opens the note and reads: 'Keep this. Burn the rest. All wrong.' Tears burst from Lori's eyes. 
Boone flings himself in front of the oncoming truck. 
CUT TO BLACK: 
FADE IN: 
49. INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM NIGHT 
A blaze of light. A bustling emergency receiving area. A stern nurse goes through the pockets of Boone's jackets, which is lying beside him on a gurney. His eyes are closed, face and T-shirt bloody. She fishes out the vial of pills. 
Boone moans, opens his eyes. 
NURSE Lucky you're in one piece, fella. 
BOONE [realizing where he is]: ...can't even kill myself... 
NURSE: There's a cheerful thought. [to an approaching doctor] I don't know what kind of fuel he's using, but this guy's cruising at about 35,000 feet. 
The doctor takes the vial of pills, checks the label. Opens Boone's eyes, shines a penlight flash on the pupils. Boone recoils. Doctor takes his pulse. 
DOCTOR: You don't hit that altitude on lithium carbonate. Let's get the prescribing doctor on the line... [finally - to Boone] Okay, we're doing all right, aren't we? Tell me, what've you been taking tonight, partner? 
BOONE: Lithium... 
The doctor opens the vial, looks at a handful of the pills. 
DOCTOR: Lithium? This isn't lithium, my friend. [to the nurse] Let's move him. Observation, let's get an IV, valium/saline, 200 milligrams percodan for pain, as needed...[quietly - hands the pills to the nurse] We'll have to call this in. 
She nods. With considerable effort, Boone sits up urgently and grabs the doctor's hand, holding the pills. 
BOONE: What was I taking? 
DOCTOR [patronizing]: Easy. We don't know until we run some tests. Looks like some kind of lab quality psychotropic hallucinogen. You're on what we used to call a 'bad trip' there, buddy. You relax now, you're gonna be fine. 
The doctor and nurse ease Boone back down onto the gurney. The doctor moves away. The nurse pulls back the curtain and rolls Boone across the hall into a semi-private room

{"train": "FADE IN: \nEXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY \nA gray, impenetrable wall of fog. From somewhere comes the FAINT SOUND of a LITTLE GIRL'S VOICE, singing, slow tempo, almost under her breath. \nYOUNG ELIZABETH (O.S.) Yo, ho, yo, ho, a pirate's life for me Yo, ho, yo, ho, it's a pirate's life for me... \nSuddenly a massive SHIP emerges from the grey, the Winged Victory maidenhead looming. It's a British dreadnought, the H.M.S. Dauntless. Formidable, frightening, twenty-five gun ports on a side, and rail guns to boot. \nEXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - FORECASTLE - DAY \nELIZABETH SWANN, strawberry blond hair, stands at the bow railing, gazing at the seas, still singing -- \nELIZABETH ...drink up me hearties, yo, ho... \nJOSHAMEE GIBBS, who was born old, skin a dark leather, clutches her shoulder, startling her. \nGIBBS (sotto) Quiet, missy! Cursed pirates sail these waters. You want to call 'em down on us? \nElizabeth stares wide-eyed at him. \nNORRINGTON Mr. Gibbs. \nNORRINGTON, a dashing young man, Royal Navy to the core, glares sternly at Gibbs. Standing besides him is GOVERNOR WEATHERBY SWAN, a man of obvious high station, brass buttons on his thick blue jacket. He is Elizabeth's father. \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) That will do. \nGIBBS She was singing about pirates. Bad luck to sing about pirates, with us mired in this unnatural fog-- mark my words. \nNORRINGTON Consider them marked.   On your way. \nGIBBS 'Aye, Captain. (as he moves off) Bad luck to have a woman on board, too. Even a mini'ture one. \nHe returns to his deck-swabbing duties, surreptitiously takes a quick swig from flask. \nELIZABETH I think it would be rather exciting to meet a pirate. \nNORRINGTON Think again, Miss Swan.   Vile and dissolute creatures, the  lot of them. I intend to see to   it that any man who sails under a  pirate flag, or wears a pirates  brand, gets what he deserves: a  short drop and a sudden stop. \nElizabeth doesn't know what 'a short drop and a sudden stop' means. Gibbs helpfully mimes: a man being hung. \nSWAN Captain Norrington... I appreciate your fervor, but I am concerned about the effect this subject will have on my daughter. \nNORRINGTON My apologies, Governor. \nELIZABETH Actually, I find it all fascinating. \nSWAN \nAnd that's what concerns me. Elizabeth, dear... we will be landing in Port Royal very soon, and beginning our new lives. Wouldn't it be wonderful if we comport ourselves as befits our class and station? \nELIZABETH Yes, father. \nChastised, she turns away, to look out over the bow rail. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (to herself) I still think it would be exciting to meet a pirate... \nThe fog still hems in the ship; very little of the sea is visible -- \n-- but suddenly, a FIGURE comes into view. A young boy, WILL TURNER, floating on his back in the otherwise empty water. There is nothing to show where he came from, or how he came to be there. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) Look!   A boy! In the water! \nNorrington and Swann spot him -- \nNORRINGTON Man overboard! \nELIZABETH Boy overboard! \nNORRINGTON Fetch a hook! Haul him out of there! \nQuick movement and activity on the deck. Sailors use a boathook to snag the boy he the passes. Norrington and Swann haul him aboard, and lay him on the deck. Elizabeth sidles in for a closer look. \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) He's still breathing. \nSWAN \nWhere did he come from? \nGIBBS Mary mother of God ... \nAttention is turned away from the boy -- \nThe sea is no longer empty. WRECKAGE from a ship litters the water... along with the bodies of its crew. What is left of the ship's hull BURNS, a ragged British flag hanging limply from the stern. \nThe H.M.S. Dauntless slips silently through it all.   The scene calls for hushed voices. \nSWAN What happened here? \nNORRINGTON An explosion in the powder magazine. Merchant vessels run heavily armed. \nGIBBS Lot of good it did them... (off Swan's look) Everyone's thinking it! I'm just saying it! Pirates! \nMURTOGG Captain Norrington's made it his flagship. He'll use it to hunt down the last dregs of piracy on the Spanish Lake. \nMULLROY Commodore. \nMURTOGG Right. Commodore Norrington. \nJACK That's a fine goal, I'm sure ... But it seems to me a ship like that -- (indicates the Dauntless) -- makes this one here just a wee superfluous. \nMURTOGG Oh, the Dauntless is the power in these waters, true enough -- but there's no ship that can match the Interceptor for speed. \nJACK That so? I've heard of one, supposed to be fast, nigh uncatchable ... the Black Pearl? \nMullroy scoffs at the name. \nMULLR0Y There's no real ship as can match the Interceptor. \nMURTOGG The Black Pearl is a real ship. \nMULLROY No, it's not. \nMURTOGG Yes it is. I've seen it. \nMULLR0Y You've seen it? \nMURTOGG Yes. \nMULLROY You've seen the Black Pearl? \nMURTOGG Yes. \nMULLR0Y \nYou haven't seen it. \nMURTOGG Yes, I have. \nMULLR0Y You've seen a ship with black sails that's crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil that hell itself spat him back out? \nMURTOGG ... No . \nMULLROY No. \nMURTOGG But I've seen a ship with black sails. \nMULLR0Y Oh, and no ship that's not crewed by the damned and captained by a man so evil hell itself spat him back out could possibly have black sails and therefore couldn't possibly be any ship other than the Black Pearl. Is that what you're saying? \nMURTOGG ... no. \nMULLR0Y (turns back to Jack) Like I said, there's no real ship as can match -- Hey! \nBut Jack's not there. Murtogg and Mullroy look around, spot \nJack standing at the wheel of the Interceptor, casually examining the mechanism. \nMULLROY (CONT'D) You! \nJack looks over in exaggeratedly innocent surprise. The sailors hurry toward the gangplank. \nMULLROY (CONT'D) Get away from there! You don't have permission to be aboard there! \nJack spreads his hands in apology. \nJACK I'm sorry. It's just such a pretty boat. Ship. \nThe sailors study him suspiciously. \nMURTOGG What's your name? \nJACK Smith. \nMULLR0Y What's your business in Port Royal, 'Mr. Smith' ? \nMURTOGG And no lies! \nJACK None? Very well. You've rumbled me. I confess: I intend to commandeer one of these ships, pick up a crew in Tortuga, and go out on the account, do a little honest pirating. \nMURTOGG I said, no lies. \nMULLR0Y I think he's telling the truth. \nMURTOGG He's not telling the truth. \nMULLROY He may be. \nMURTOGG If he were telling the truth he wouldn't have told us. \nJACK Unless, of course, he knew you wouldn't believe the truth if he told it to you. \nMurtogg and Mullroy consider that point -- \nEXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY \nElizabeth, pale and perspiring, fans herself weakly, oblivious to the music and chatter. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - OCEAN - DAY \nUNDERWATER: the medallion hangs below Elizabeth's unmoving form - - and then Jack is there. He wraps an arm around her and makes for the surface. \nON THE SURFACE, Jack swims toward the dock, struggling. It is .: far more difficult than it should be. He stops stroking, and they submerge. \nUNDERWATER: Jack realizes that   it is Elizabeth's heavy velvet dress that is weighing   them down. He pulls at the buttons on the back, and they   give way. He skins her out of the dress, and kicks away from   it. \nThe dress falls like a cloud into darkness - \nON THE SURFACE: Jack swims with Elizabeth, much more quickly. \nAT THE DOCK, Murtogg and Mullroy are there to help haul Elizabeth out of the water. \nJack climbs up, exhausted. Elizabeth is on her back; Murtogg holds her arms above her head, pumping them. Mullroy puts his cheek to her nose and mouth. \nMULLROY Not breathing. \nMurtogg looks down; it seems hopeless. Jack steps up, drawing Murtogg's knife from its sheath. \nJACK \nMove. \nHe pushes past Mullroy, kneels over Elizabeth, raises the knife -- Murtogg is shocked - \nJack slits the corset down the middle, yanks it away. \nElizabeth remains still. And then -- she coughs up water and gasps, choking on her first full breath. Jack is relieved. \nMULLROY I never would have thought of that. \nJACK Clearly, you've never been to Singapore. \nJack flips the knife and hands it hilt-first to Murtogg - and that's when he spots - \nThe MEDALLION. Jack catches it up in his \"hand. \nJACK (CONT'D) Where did you get this? \nBefore Elizabeth can answer, the BLADE of a SWORD is at Jack's THROAT -- Norrington's new ceremonial sword, in fact, looking bright and sharp. \nNORRINGTON On your feet. \nIt looks bad -- Jack standing over Elizabeth, most of her clothes gone. He gets to his feet. The rest of Elizabeth's erstwhile rescuers reach the scene, including Swann. \nSWANN Elizabeth! Are you all right? \nHe strips off his jacket, drapes it around her. \nELIZABETH Yes -- yes, I'm fine -- Commodore Norrington, do you intend to kill my rescuer? \nNorrington looks at Jack. Jack nods as best he can with a blade beneath his chin. Norrington sheathes his sword, and extends his hand. \nNORRINGTON I believe thanks are in order. \nJack takes Norrington's hand gingerly. They shake - \n-- and Norrington tightens his grip, yanks Jack's arm toward him, then tears back the sleeve of Jack's shirt - \n-- exposing a BRAND on Jack's inner wrist: a large 'P.' \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) Had a brush-up with the East India Trading Company, did you ... pirate? \nThe others react in shock, but the sailors are well-trained --in an instant, half a dozen pistols are aimed at Jack. He stands there, still holding the corset. \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) Keep your guns on him, men. Gillette, fetch some irons. \nNorrington notices something else -- below the 'P' brand is a tattoo: a small bird in flight across water. \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) Well, well... Jack Sparrow, isn't it? \nJACK Captain Jack Sparrow. If you please. \nNorrington looks out at the bay. \nNORRINGTON I don't see your ship -- Captain. \nMURTOGG He said he'd come to commandeer one. \nMULLROY (to Murtogg) I told you he was telling the truth. (currying favor) These are his, sir. \nHe holds out Jack's pistol and belt. Norrington takes the pistol, examines it, notes the powder horn on Jack's belt. \nNORRINGTON (to Jack) Extra powder, but no additional shot. \nJack shrugs. Norrington unhooks the compass from the belt, opens it. He frowns at the reading. Moves the compass this way and that, keeping it parallel to the ground. \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) It doesn't bear true. \nJack looks away, a bit embarrassed. Norrington returns the compass to the belt. Draws the sword half from the scabbard. \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) I half-expected it to be made of wood. \nThree seedy-looking prisoners try to coax the dog to their cell door. One holds a loop of rope; another waggles a bone. The dog just sits and cocks its head. \nPRISONER Come here, boy... Want a nice, juicy bone? \nIn an adjoining cell, Jack lies on a pile of straw. \nJACK You can keep doing that forever, that dog's never going to move. \nPRISONER Excuse us if we ain't resigned ourselves to the gallows just yet. \nEXT. FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT \nA noose hangs from a gallows in the courtyard. Norrington and Swann walk along the far wall. \nSWANN Has my daughter given you an answer yet? \nNORRINGTON No. She hasn't. \nSWANN Well, she had a taxing day... Ghastly weather tonight. \nNORRINGTON Bleak. Very bleak. \nFrom the distance, there is a BOOM - \nSWANN What was that? \n-- and then the WHISTLE of an incoming ball -- \nNORRINGTON Cannon fire! \nHe tackles Swann as the wall of the parapet EXPLODES -- \nINT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nJack sits up. There are more BOOMS - \nJACK I know those guns! \nHe peers out through the bars of the window. The other prisoners crowd around their window as well. \nJACK (CONT'D) It's the Black Pearl. \nPRISONER (frightened) The Black Pearl? I've heard stories ... she's been preying on ships and settlements for near ten years ... and never leaves any survivors. \nJACK There are a lot of stories about the Black Pearl. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - NIGHT \nThe Black Pearl still cannot be seen -- but the fog lights up around her with each boom of her guns. She's firing on both sides now, hammering both the fort and the town. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - TOWN - NIGHT \nStreets, buildings, docks and ships shatter and explode beneath the onslaught. Villagers panic, run for cover, dodge flying debris as best they can. If this is not hell on earth, then it's about to be -- \n-- long boats emerge out of the fog, carrying ARMED PIRATES. They swarm from the boats, striking down ,villagers indiscriminately and setting fires. \nINT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT \nWill slips the boarding axe into his belt at the small of his back. He puts a dirk in his belt, then a second and a third. He picks up a second axe and a sword. \nWill slides back the doors of the forge -- \nA woman runs past, chased by a ONE-ARMED PIRATE wearing a yellow bandeau. Will backhands the axe square into his chest, a deadly blow. Will heads out, up the street -- \nEXT. FORT CHARLES - PARAPETS - NIGHT \nThe moon is obscured by smoke rising from the burning gallows and wooden roofs. Cannon fire continues to rain down, but the fort's own cannons now return fire. \nNORRINGTON Governor! Barricade yourself in my office! (Swann hesitates) That's an order! \nSwann turns to go -- but finds himself face-to-face with a pirate -- KOEHLER, a handsome blond man with gold earrings. Beyond Koehler, more pirates come up over the far wall. Koehler grins and raises a cutlass - \n-- Norrington's sword blocks Koehler's slash. \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) They've flanked us! Men! Swords and pistols! \nThe battle is joined -- \nINT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH f S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nElizabeth looks out a window at the scene below: even through the fog, multiple fires are visible, and ships burn in the harbor. Shouts and cries of pain. Cannon fire ECHOES. \nShe notices movement directly below her window: two SHADOWY FIGURES, approaching the house -- pirates. Elizabeth bolts from her room-- \nINT. SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT \nShe reaches the railing overlooking the foyer, and cries out, just as the butler opens the door -- too late; there is the BOOM of a gun, and the butler crumples. \nElizabeth ducks down in horror, peering through the balusters. The pirates scan the foyer, searching. The leader is PINTEL, a sallow-looking pirate with a bald head. \nSuddenly Pintel looks up, and locks eyes with Elizabeth. How could he know she was there? \nPINTEL Up there! \nElizabeth works the ropes to lower  the box. Pintel pulls the other way; he's stronger, and  the box rises. Elizabeth tries to stop it -- wraps her left  forearm through the rope and lets it jam against the top of  the box. \nElizabeth gasps at the pain, but the box stops. She saws at the rope with the bread knife. \nSmoldering pirate helps pull the rope, crushing Elizabeth's forearm. Tears of pain on her face, she keeps sawing - \nThe rope parts, and the dumbwaiter box PLUMMETS - \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nFrom behind the door of the dumbwaiter comes a CRASH, and a cloud of dust. The door slides open, and Elizabeth clambers out. Her head is cut, she is streaked with dirt, and can barely stand. She leans over the table, trying to recover. \nThe sound of running FOOTSTEPS gets louder ... \nELIZABETH Please, no ... \nElizabeth touches the chain of the medallion ... and a desperate idea occurs to her. \nThe pirates burst through the door. Elizabeth backs away, holds the bread knife out to ward them off. They come around either side of the table, stalking her - \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (gasps it out) Par. .. Parlay! \nPintel can't believe his ears. \nPINTEL What? \nELIZABETH Parlay! I invoke the right of parlay! According to\" the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew, you must take me to your Captain! \nPINTEL I know the code. \nELIZABETH If an adversary demands parley, you can do them no harm until the parlay is complete. \nPINTEL It would appear, so do you. \nSMOLDERING PIRATE To blazes with the code! \nHe steps forward, dirk drawn -- Pintel stops him. \nPINTEL She wants to be taken to the Captain, and she'll go without a fuss. \nHe looks to Elizabeth: 'right?' Elizabeth nods. \nPINTEL (CONT'D) We must honor the code. \nSmoldering Pirate concedes the point, sheaths his dirk. He grabs Elizabeth roughly by the arm - \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - NIGHT \nWill races along, momentarily free of the pirates. He spots the Governor's Mansion in the distance. There are FIGURES moving away from it -- Elizabeth, forced by the two pirates. \nWill hurries forward - \nSuddenly a PIRATE jumps out from the shadows, slashes; Will defends himself. The pirate has one arm and wears a yellow bandana. Will hesitates -- didn't he already kill this guy? \nThe hesitation is just enough for another PIRATE, swinging a flaming torch, to SLAM Will in the head from behind. Will crumples. \nThe pirate lights a second torch, hands it to One-arm; they hoot with delight and head off, setting fires as they go. \nOn the ground, Will doesn't move. \nINT. FORT CHARLES - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nThe wall of the cells EXPLODES inward. Jack pulls himself out from under rubble. Moonlight spills in through the gaping hole created by the cannon ball. Beyond it: freedom. \nBut it is centered on the other cell. The part of Jack's cell that is gone is too small for a man to slip through. \nPRISIONER Praise be! \nHe and the other two scramble through. \nPRISONER (CONT'D) (back to Jack) My sympathies, friend - - you've no manner of luck at all! \nThe three descend the rocks beyond, disappearing from view. \nJack is alone. Cannon fire continues, occasional hits shaking the fort. The dog cowers under a long bench, key ring still in his mouth. Jack sighs -- resigned, he picks up the bone from the other cell, and tries coax the dog forward. \nJACK It's all right, doggie ... come here, \nboy. Come here, Spot. Rover. Fido? \nTo his surprise, the dog crawls out from under the bench. Jack continues to coax him closer. \nThe key ring is nearly within Jack's reach -- suddenly, the dog's attention goes to the door into the cell block. He BRISTLES, GROWLS. He backs away from the door, whining. \nJACK (CONT'D) What's the matter, boy? \nThe dog bolts, through the bars, into the cell, then out through the breached wall -- taking the keys with him. \nThe door to the cell block bursts open. A pair of pirates step in: KOEHLER and TWIGG. \nTWIGG This isn't the armory. \nHe turns to go, but Koehler has spotted Jack. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) I'll drop it! \nBARBOSSA My holds are bursting with swag. That bit of shine matters to me ... Why? \nELIZABETH Because it's what you're searching for. You've been searching for it for years. I recognize this ship. \nI saw it eight years ago, when we made the crossing from England. \nBARBOSSA (interested) Did you, now? \nElizabeth glares at him. She's getting nowhere. \nELIZABETH Fine. I suppose if this is worthless, there's no reason to keep it. \nShe flips the medallion up, off her finger - \nBARBOSSA NO! \nShe catches it by the chain, smiles at him triumphantly. \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) You have a name, missy? \nELIZABETH Elizabeth - (stops herself from saying \"Swann\"; then:) Turner. (embroidering) I'm a maid in the governor's household. (curtsies) Barbossa reacts to the name Turner: it confirms what he has suspected. The other pirates surreptitiously exchange glances and nods. \nBARBOSSA You've got sand, for a maid. \nELIZABETH (curtsies again) Thank you, sir. \nBARBOSSA \nAnd how does a maid come to own a trinket such as that? A family heirloom, perhaps? \nELIZABETH Of course. (offended) I didn't steal it, if that's what you mean. \nBARBOSSA No, no, nothing like that. (comes to a decision) Very well. You hand that over, we'll put your town to our rudder and ne'er return. \nELIZABETH Can I trust you? \nBARBOSSA It's you who invoked the parlay! Believe me, Miss, you'd best hand it over, now... or these be the last friendly words you'll hear! \nElizabeth hesitates, but she has no choice. She holds out the medallion. He grabs it, clutches it in his fist like hope. \nELIZABETH Our bargain. . ? \nBarbossa grins devilishly -- but then nods to the Bosun. \nBOSUN Still the guns, and stow 'em! Signal the men, set the flags, and make good to clear port! \nFor the first time since the attack began, the BOOMING of the guns ceases. Elizabeth is surprised -- and relieved. The pirates hustle to follow orders. Barbossa turns away. \nELIZABETH Wait! You must return me to shore! According to the rules of the Order of the Brethren - \nBarbossa wheels on her. \nBARBOSSA First. Your return to shore was not part of our negotiations nor our agreement, and so I 'must' do nothing. Secondly: you must be a pirate for the pirate's code to apply. And you're not. And thirdly... \nthe code is more what you'd call guidelines than actual rules. \n(grins gold and silver) \nWelcome aboard the Black Pearl, Miss Turner. \nElizabeth stares in speechless terror - \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - PRE-DAWN \nAs the Black Pearl turns out to sea, Elizabeth is led back along the deck to the captain's cabin. \nThe fog starts to dissipate, turning to a light mist; through it, the Black Pearl makes for the scarlet glow of dawn. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - STREET - PRE-DAWN \nWill comes to, still where he fell, gets to his feet. \nHe takes in the devastation of Port Royal: the harbor is dotted with burning and sunken ships; buildings are razed and still smolder. The aftermath of hell on earth. \nWill turns, and runs for the Governor's Mansion. \nINT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - MORNING \nWill races past the smashed doors, into the foyer. Calls out: \nWILL Miss Swann! Elizabeth! \nA terrible silence answers him. He spots an overturned chair, fallen bookshelf - \nINT. FORT CHARLES - NORRINGTON'S OFFICE - MORNING \nWill bursts in, still armed with sword and boarding axe. \nWILL They've taken her! They've taken Elizabeth! \nA group stares at him: Swann, Norrington, and Gillette among others, gathered around a map. The map is so large it drapes over the Governor's desk, the far end supported by a chair. \nWill heads for the door. Jack searches the desk, cupboards. \nJACK Not without my effects. \nWILL We need to go! \nJack finds his pistol, sword belt, and compass. Straps on the belt, checks the shot in his pistol. \nWILL (CONT'D) Why are you bothering with that? \nJACK My business, Will. As for your business -one question, or there's no use going. (joins Will at the door) This girl -- what does she mean to you? How far are you willing to go to save her? \nWILL (no hesitation) I'd die for her. \nJACK Good. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - MORNING \nThe Jolly Mon, four inches of water in the bottom, squats low in the water, heeled to one side, creaking on its lines. \nJACK (O.S.) Ah, now there's a lovely sight! \nJack hops down into the boat. Prepares to make way. \nJACK (CONT'D) I knew the Harbormaster wouldn't report her. Honest men are slaves to their conscience, and there's no predicting 'em. But you can always trust a dishonest man to stay that way... \nJack notices that Will is standing, frozen on the dock, staring at the boat in dismay. \nJACK (CONT'D) Come aboard. \nWILL I haven't set foot off dry land I was twelve, when the ship I was on exploded. (regards the boat) It's been a sound policy. \nJACK No worries there. She's far more likely to rot out from under us. \nWill steels himself, steps into the boat as if its going to capsize with the slightest movement. Jack hoists the sail. \nJACK (CONT'D) Besides, we are about to better our prospects considerably. \nHe nods toward the H.M.S. Dauntless, looming in the harbor. Will whiteknuckles the gunwales. \nWILL We're going to steal a ship? That ship? \nJACK Commandeer. We're going to commandeer a ship. Nautical term. \nWILL It's still against the law. \nJACK \nSo's breaking a man out of jail. Face it, Will: you may say you'll never be a pirate, but you're off to a rip-roaring start. (smiling) My advice -- smile and enjoy it. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - MORNING \nThe Jolly Mon bobs its way across the bay, dwarfed against the H.M.S. Dauntless. Will holds a stay line with iron fists. \nWILL This is either crazy, or brilliant. \nJACK Remarkable how often those two traits coincide. \nThe Jolly Man nears the rudder of the much larger ship - \nEXT. H. M. S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - MORNING \nThere's been a breakdown in discipline; about a dozen Navy sailors are gathered together on the main deck, playing dice. Murtogg and Mullroy among them. \nSuddenly, Jack and Will jump out, into the open - \nbrandishing pistols. \nJACK Everybody stay calm. We're taking over the ship! \nWILL (a beat) Aye! Avast! \nJack gives him a look, shakes his head: don't do that. \nThe sailors all look   at them -- and then burst out LAUGHING. They grin,   shake their heads. Jack stands there, grinning with them --   but his gun is still level. The Lieutenant, GILLETTE,   steps forward. \nGILLETTE \nYou're serious about this. \nJack moves his pistol across, points it at Gillette. \nJACK Dead serious. \nGILLETTE You understand this ship cannot be crewed by only two men. You'll never make it out of the bay. \nJACK We'll see about that. \nMore guffaws from the crew. A couple sailors move forward, hands on swords -- Gillette holds up a hand. \nGILLETTE Sir, I'll not see any of my men killed or wounded in this foolish enterprise. \nJACK Fine by me. We brought you a nice little boat, so you can all get back to shore, safe and sound. \nBut the distance is already too great. One brave sailor tries to swing across on a rope, Errol-Flynn style, but falls short with a splash. \nJack waves, and shouts across the distance - \nJACK Thank you, Commodore, for getting our ship ready to make way! We'd've had a hard time of it by ourselves! \nNorrington seethes, but his order to Gillette is measured: \nNORRINGTON Raise the sails. \nGILLETTE The wind is quarter from astern ... by the time we're underway, we'll never catch them. \nNORRINGTON We need only to come about, to put them in range of the long nines. \nGillette looks surprised at the order -- but relays it. \nGILLETTE Hands! Come about! Jackets off the cannons! (to Norrington) We are to fire on our own ship? \nNORRINGTON Better to see it at the bottom of the sea than in the hands of a pirate. \nThe STEERSMAN turns the wheel. The Dauntless' course does not change one whit. \nSTEERSMAN Captain, there's a problem. \nThe Steersman spins the wheel. It goes round and round, with no signs of slowing. \nSTEERSMAN (CONT'D) He's disabled the rudder chain, sir. \nNORRINGTON So it would seem. \nThe Interceptor dwindles with distance. Gillette watches it go, with some degree of admiration. \nGILLETTE He's got to be the best pirate I've ever seen. \nNorrington reaches out, stops the spinning ship's wheel. \nNORRINGTON So it would seem. \nThe Interceptor makes for the horizon line. A SLOW DISSOLVE and with the time passage, the ship is gone; the sky turns a deep twilight blue - \nEXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - EVENING \n-- with the fat white moon riding just above the horizon. Suddenly, the edge of a black sail cuts into the foreground, accompanied by the ROAR of the wind and the SNAP of canvas - \nINT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - EVENING \nElizabeth stalks the cabin. Pintel enters, carrying a black silk dress. \nPINTEL You'll be dining with the Captain, and he requests you wear this. \nELIZABETH Tell the captain that I am disinclined to acquiesce to his request. \nPINTEL (happy) He said you say that! He also said if that be the case, you'll be dining with the crew, and you'll be naked. \nAngry, Elizabeth holds out her hand. Pintel's grin fades. \nPINTEL (CONT'D) (hands it over) Fine. \nHe exits, pouting. Elizabeth examines the dress - \nINT. BLACK PEARL - CAPTAIN'S CABIN - NIGHT \nBarbossa enters, followed by PIRATES carrying trays of food, wine, table setting, etc. Elizabeth stands at the small table in the dress -- lovely. \nBARBOSSA Maid or not, it fits you. \nELIZABETH \nDare I ask the fate of its previous owner? \nBARBOSSA Now, none of that. Please dig in. \nThe table is set. Elizabeth sits, cuts a tiny piece of meat, eats it daintily. \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) No need to stand on ceremony, and no call to impress anyone. You must be hungry. \nElizabeth drops the pretense: she's starving, and begins to eat like it. Barbossa watches her intently. \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) Try the wine. \nElizabeth does, a huge swig; she tears off a hunk of bread, devours it. \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) And the apples -- one of those next. \nShe starts to bite into the apple -- stops. She is suddenly aware of Barbossa's gaze -- and that he is not eating. \nELIZABETH It's poisoned! \nShe shoves her plate away -- and takes the opportunity to palm her knife. Barbossa LAUGHS. \nBARBOSSA Oh, there would be no sense in killing you, Miss Turner. \nELIZABETH Then why aren't you eating? \nEXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY \nThe Interceptor cuts across the waves. Jack at the wheel; Will tightens a line, moves back astern. \nEXT. INTERCEPTOR - MAIN DECK - DAY \nWill sharpens his sword with a whetstone: shhhk -- shhhk \nJACK For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study. \nWILL I worked passage   from England as a cabin boy. (an attempt  at guile) After my mother  passed, I came out here ... looking  for my father. \nJACK Is that so? \nWILL My father. William Turner? \nJack says nothing. Will has lost the patience for guile. \nWILL ( CONT ' D) I'm not a simpleton. At the jail - - it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help. (a smile) Since that's what I wanted, I didn't press the matter. But now - \n{an accusation} \nYou knew my father. \nJack considers his reply -- settles on 'truth.' \nJACK I knew him. Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill. \nWILL 'Bootstrap?' \nJACK Good man. Good pirate. And clever -\"- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin. \nWILL (angry) That's not true. \nJACK I swear, you look just like him. \nWILL It's not true that my father was a pirate. \nJACK Figured you wouldn't want to hear it. \nWILL He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules-- \nJACK (laughs) You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable \nlife. And they're all 'merchant marines.' \nWILL My father did not think of my mother -his family -- as a burden. \nJACK Sure -- because he could always go pirating. \nWILL My father -- was not -- a pirate! \nWill's sword is out, levelled at Jack. Jack gives him a disbelieving look, sighs. \nJACK Put it away, Will. It's not worth getting beat again. \nWILL You didn't beat me. You ignored the rules of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you. \nJACK Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it? \nHe kicks a lever on a wench. The sail boom whips around and slams Will in the chest -- sweeping him off the ship. His sword clatters onto the deck. Will dangles above the water. \nJack slips a loop of rope around the wheel to hold the course. Picks up the sword -- and pokes at Will with it. Will hand-over-hands away from the blade, to the end of the boom. \nJACK ( CONT ' D) As long as you're just hanging there, pay attention. Must, Should, do, don't, shall, shall not -- those are just suggestions. There are only two absolute rules. (ticks them off on his fingers) \nJACK (CONT'D) What a man can do. And what a man can I t do. \nWill looks away, not interested. \nJACK (CONT'D) For instance: you can accept that your father was a pirate and still a good man... or you can't. Now me, I can sail this ship to Tortuga, by myself. . . (Will looks alarmed) But I can't just let you drown. \nJack swings the boom back in. Will drops to the deck. Jack holds the hilt of the sword out. Will takes it. Glares at Jack, considers what he'll do next. Jack watches him coolly. \nWill turns and strides to his spot on the deck, sits down, and resumes sharpening his sword: shhhk -- shhhk -- shhhk \nJack breathes silent sigh of relief. Notices his hand is shaking -- he takes the wheel. \nWILL Tortuga? \nJACK Oh -- did I forget to mention that? \nEXT. TORTUGA - DAY \nA dank and dirty port, where the tides seem to have swept together the scum of the Caribbean -- pirates, privateers, prostitutes, thieves, and drunkards. \nWith its cantered, rotting docks, weatherbeaten buildings, and odd assortment of livestock running free -- a donkey, chickens, etc. -- it is far less civilized than Port Royal. \nJack and Will move through the crowd. A REDHEADED woman turns her head -- she has noticed Jack. \nJACK \nWe need a crew. We can manage the ship between islands, but the open sea, that's another matter - \nGIBBS Say again? \nJACK Ilm going after the Black Pearl. I know where its going to be, and I'm going to take it. \nGIBBS Jack, it's a fool's errand: You've heard the tales they tell about the Pearl. \nJACK Aye, and that's why I know where it's going to be, and that's why I know what Barbossa is up to. All I need is a crew. \nGIBBS (shakes his head) A fool's errand. \nJACK \nNot if the fool has something Barbossa wants. Something he needs. \nGIBBS And you've got that, have you? \nANGLE ON: Jack, as he smiles enigmatically, and shifts his eyes' -- behind him, Will, still on guard, glares a sailor away from the table. \nJACK Back there, guarding the door is the son of old Bootstrap Bill Turner. \nGibbs' eyes widen over the edge of the tankard. Peers at Will. Then smiles, with more missing teeth than good ones. \nGIBBS Well, lookee there. I'll allow you may be onto something, Jack. (considers, nods) There's bound to be sailors on this rock crazy as you. I'll find some men. \nGibbs downs the drink, SLAMS the tankard on the table. \nWill reacts to the sound, draws both sword and dagger, kicks over a table for cover, and whirls on anyone who moves. \nGIBBS (CONT'D) Kid's a bit of a stick, isn't he? \nJACK That he is. \nEXT. TORTUGA - DOCK - LATER - DAY \nOn the docks, a disheveled, motley and weatherbeaten group of about a dozen swabs stand in a ragged line-up. \nGIBBS Feast your eyes, Cap'n. All of 'em good sea-faring men, faithful hands before the mast, every one worth his salt -- \n(sotto, making his point) -- and crazy, to boot. \nJack holds up a hand -- enough. He moves down the line, Gibbs at his side. Then he notices AnaMaria in line, dressed like a man, He raises an eyebrow. \nANAMARIA You owe me a boat. \nJack nods, continues. One sailor is quite fat, another thin and sickly. Jack is not happy with his choices. \nHe stops in front of COTTON, a short sailor with a large, colorful PARROT on his shoulder. Jack raises an eyebrow. \nGIBBS Cotton here is mute, sir. Poor devil had his tongue cut out -- \nCotton opens his mouth to show this -- Jack grimaces. \nGIBBS (CONT'D) -- so he went and trained the parrot to do the talking for him, nobody knows how. Nobody knows the parrot's name, neither, so we just call it 'Cotton's parrot.' \nJack decides to test this. \nJACK Mr. Cotton. Do you have the courage and fortitude to follow orders and stay true, in the face danger, and almost certain death? \nCotton lifts the parrot off his shoulder, raises it -- \nCOTTON'S PARROT Wind in your SAILS! Wind in your SAILS! \nGIBBS Mostly, that seem to mean 'yes.' \nCotton nods vigorously, lowers the parrot, and it goes silent. Jack shakes his head. Steps back. \nJACK \nThat goes for the rest of you! Danger and near certain death. (turns away) For we are to sail for the Isla de Muerta, to rescue the daughter of Governor Swann. An equal share of the reward shall be - \nJack hears movement, looks back -- several potential crew members back away in fright; first one, then another, turn and run, followed by more. \nSoon just a half dozen are left, including Cotton (with parrot) -- and AnaMaria. \nWILL Shut up, before you lose them all! \nJACK These are the only ones worth having. (glances at the sky) And we're going to need them- \nEXT. H. M. S. INTERCEPTOR - DAY \nA FLASH of lightening and the CRACK of thunder. The canvas of every sail is stretched taut. The ship rocks as it drops into the valley of huge swell, climbs up the other side. \nOn board, the new crew members scurry about their tasks, pulling lines and trimming sails. Excellent sailors, it takes everything they have to keep the ship afloat. \nAnaMaria is at the helm. Gibbs staggers along the deck. \nGIBBS That fool will have us lose the canvas, and the masts besides! \nOn Jack, a ROARING wind blowing back his hair, eyes intent on their course. Gibbs climbs the tilted deck toward him. \nGIBBS (CONT'D) Werd best drop canvas, sirl \nJACK She can hold a bit longer. \nHe starts off. \nWILL Wait -- what about the pistol? \nJACK The pistol. When a pirate is marooned, Will, he's given a pistol with a single shot. No good for hunting, or surviving, really. But after three weeks of starvation and thirst -- the option of that pistol begins to look good. \nJack lets this sink in. He pulls out the pistol, raises it. \nJACK (CONT'D) But I survived. And I still have that single shot. It's meant for one man. My mutinous first mate - \nWILL \nBarbossa. \nJack shoots a glance at Will -- nods, and moves away. \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING \nOn Barbossa, face upturned. No expression in his eyes. \nAround him a group of pirates, Elizabeth among them, stand as still as stones, in front of a dark cave opening. Their faces look upward, their total lack of movement disconcerting. \nAbove the cave, on a hillock, the pirate Koehler gazes out toward the horizon. Slowly he TRANSFORMS, head-to-toe, from pirate to SKELETON- \nThe MOON has climbed free of the storm clouds, rising large. and full on the horizon. The skeleton turns - \nKOEHLER Moonrise, Captain! First night of full. \nBARBOSSA Hah! (to the pirates) Be mindful of pits and crevasses. Stay together. \nHe takes a torch. Moves into the cave. The pirates follow. \nINT. ISLA DE MUERTE -     CAVES    - NIGHT \nThe group keeps together under the firelight. The path leads between boulders on a slope downhill. From the echoes and shadows, it's clear the cave system must be huge. \nElizabeth glances over -- the torches illumine caverns off to the side -- and just the edge of a mound of coins. Clearly there is more, but the rest is lost in darkness. \nTwigg, gazing upward in wonder, moves a few feet away from the group. Barbossa grabs him as he nears a chasm. \nBARBOSSA Careful, mate. Fall down there, you'd die and miss Judgement Day -- for not even the Lord himself'll come look for you here. \nBarbossa lets go, and moves on, descending down, twisting and turning, but always down - \nEXT. H.M.S. INTERCEPTOR - NIGHT \nCotton pulls a sail line, looks out -- sees something. He lifts the parrot off his shoulder, strokes it along the back. \nCOTTON'S PARROT Land HO! Land HO! LAND ho! LAND ho! \nIndeed, the faint outline of Isla de Muerta is in the distance on the port side. Will stands, excited, jumps onto the rigging for a better look. \nBut AnaMaria, at the helm, stares at Cotton, and the parrot. \nANAMARIA How does he do that? \nJACK They'll be anchored on the lee side. Haul your wind, and keep to the weather of the island - \nINT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVES - NIGHT \nFlickering torchlight. Pirates stoop low to enter a cavern \n-- and revealed is the spectacular treasure of Isla de \nMuerta: overflowing ,chests of coins, gold and silver ingots, jewelry, objects d' art, jade and ivory, brightly colored silks, furniture, jewels and pearls; mirrors and swords -anything and everything of value that might be carried by ship, is here. \nThe pirates move through, Elizabeth can't help but gaze in wonder. \nELIZABETH The curse drove you to gather this? \nBARBOSSA (O.S.) \nAye. And not a bit of it any use to us, only hoarded. But it will drive us no longer. \nElizabeth pauses, staring at herself in a jewel-encrusted mirror -- and then is pushed along by the pirates. \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - LAGOON - NIGHT \nThe Interceptor lies at anchor in the distance. Closer, Jack and will row away from the larger vessel in a small longboat, toward the rocky shore. \nThe RUSH of a waterfall grows louder. Will looks: ahead of them is a black CAVE MOUTH, right at water level. \nWILL What's that? \nJACK Depends. \nWILL On what? \nJACK On whether the stories are    all true. If they are, that's    a waterfall that spills over    at high tide, with a short drop to    an underground lagoon. If not    - \nBy now, the moving water tugs on the longboat, and they are sucked in -- \nJACK (CONT'D) -- well, too late. \nBARBOSSA \nIf you had sailed with Morgan for ten years like I have, you'd know not to question me! \nElizabeth sits up, watching the pirates argue, for a moment unnoticed. Suddenly, a scabbard comes down, right above her. \nStartled, Elizabeth looks up -- \n-- Will is at the top of a mound of coins, reaching down with his scabbard for her to grab onto. \nElizabeth quickly leans forward, takes the bloodied medallion from the pile. Reaches back, grabs the scabbard. Will pulls her up - \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) If any coward here dare challenge me, let him speak! Any more talk, I'll chain ye to a cannon and send ye to the watery depths! \nA sound catches his attention -- coins falling. He looks up, sees Will and Elizabeth at the top of the treasure stack. \nATOP THE STACK, Will grabs a large shield, flings them forward -- the two ride down the mountain of coins on the far side, slide through a small opening - \nINT. ISLA DE MUERTE - SMALL CAVERN - NIGHT \nBehind them, loose coins from their slide come down in an avalanche, sealing the entrance. \nElizabeth jumps up, silver platter in hand, ready to swing -Jack catches her before she can do any damage. They recognize each other. \nELIZABETH You?! \nJACK Me! \nELIZABETH You're in league with Barbossa! \nJACK No, I'm -- rescuing you. \nElizabeth can't comprehend that one. \nELIZABETH You?! \nWill gains his footing in the rubble. \nWILL Miss Swann! We're here to rescue you! (sounds of pursuit, approaching) It's going badly! \nJACK This way! \nThey race off, toward a bit of moonlight - \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT \nThe three climb up a dark crevasse that leads out onto the island. Will takes Elizabeth's hand, helps her. \nWILL I'm glad we got here in time. \nELIZABETH Truthfully -- you were a bit late. \nJACK The trick isn't getting here, it's getting away. \nAs if on cue, they hear the yells of pirates, coming closer. They take off - \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CLEARING - NIGHT \nThe three race through the rocks, the sounds of pursuit close behind. Suddenly Jack stops. \nELIZABETH Come on! \nJACK \nNo. This won't work. (a quick decision) I'll stay behind, and fight them. You go on. \nWill and Elizabeth stare at him. \nWILL No. \nJACK I'll lead them away. \nThe sounds are closer. \nJACK (CONT'D) Go to the opposite end of the island, and signal the ship. I'll keep 'em busy. \nWILL Are you sure? Jack -- this is not something you have to do. \nJACK I'm sure. When you've led the kind of life I have, there are debts that must be paid. Maybe I can balance the scales a little. \nWill nods, hesitates... gives Jack his sword - - now Jack has two, ..one for each hand. Elizabeth gives him a quick kiss. \nWill and Elizabeth race away, and are gone. \nJack watches them for a moment, turns to face the pirates. He sticks the two swords in the ground, crossed. Leans casually against a rock. \nA group of pirates round a corner, cutlasses drawn, ready to fight -- but Jack raises his hand. \nJACK (CONT'D) I invoke the right of parlay, according to the Code of the Brethren, set down by the pirates Morgan and Bartholomew... \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTE - NIGHT \nJack stands before Barbossa, surrounded by pirates. Jack has a wide smile on his face -- and Barbossa doesn't like it. \nWILL And Jack. And the crew. Free and unharmed. I f you agree... then... I will remain with you. \nBarbossa considers; his crew waits. Finally - \nBARBOSSA \nAgreed. You have my word, as a gentleman of fortune - \nELIZABETH Will -- you can't trust him. \nWILL You must swear by the Holy Bible. \nBARBOSSA Eh? You have my word, then -- on the Good Book, I do swear, and the Lord spare my worthless soul. \nBarbossa crosses himself, as do many of his men. \nWill lowers the gun ... steps down -- the pirates surround him. They snatch away the pistol. \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) Boatswain! Take your captives belowdecks. Chain them in the galley, and teach 'em how to row. \nGibbs, AnaMaria, Cotton and the rest are led away under guard. Barbossa looks out to sea, toward the islet. \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) Hah. Look there. That's the very same island we made Jack governor of on our last trip. (nods\") When you sail the open sea as long as I, you learn to trust the signs fate sends your way. \nGIBBS (dejected) Amen to that... \nBARBOSSA Jack, Elizabeth ... I'm a man of my word and you're to be set free, right quick. (loudly) Men, break out the plank! \nA CHEER goes up from the pirates. Will realizes what Barbossa intends to do, struggles with his captors. \nWILL No! You gave your word! \nBARBOSSA Quiet, boy, or you'll lose your tongue. Those as know me know I wouldn't cross my word, and bring down bad luck on the ship. (nods) I agreed to set them free. I didn't say when. .. nor where. \nEXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY \nThe Black Pearl lies at anchor, closer now to the islet. \nEXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY \nJack, wrists still bound, stands in the classic 'walking the plank' pose. Elizabeth is next in line. Pirates crowd the ship's rail to watch. \nJACK It's pure evil to make a Captain walk the plank of his own ship, twice in one lifetime. No good can come of it. \nBARBOSSA Now, Jack. That reef is less than a league distant. It's a square deal all around, and you can't hope for better. \nJACK Someone needs to cut these bonds, then. \nBarbossa smiles, shows a pistol. Points it at Jack. \nBARBOSSA You'd best take a swim, Jack. \nJACK The last time you did this, you left me a pistol, with one shot. \nThe pirates mutter agreement. \nPINTEL That's proper, sir, according to the code. \nBARBOSSA By the Powers, you're right! ( turns around) Where's Jack's pistol? Who's got it? Bring it forward! \nJACK A gentleman might give us two pistols, seeing as there are two of us, this time. \nA pirate hands Jack's pistol to Barbossa. \nBARBOSSA Tell you what. I'll   give you one pistol, and let you   be the gentleman, an' shoot the lady,   and starve to death yourself! (grins) That is, presuming   you're not both drownded. \nThe pirates laugh. Barbossa tosses Jack the pistol -- but over his head, and down into the water with a splash. \nBARBOSSA (CONTID) So how did you get off that island, anyway? \nJACK You can go to your grave not knowing. \nBARBOSSA That's fair. \nJack glares at Barbossa. Then he's prodded with a cutlass, takes a step out. Reaches the end of the plank -- steps off. \nJack plunges down into the water. Appears on the surface, floundering, struggles to stay afloat. Will and Elizabeth exchange helpless looks; there is nothing they can do. \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) \nThe lady's next. But first, I'll be wanting that dress back, if you please. \nElizabeth hesitates ... then strips it off, leaving her in a silk slip. She throws it at him. \nELIZABETH Here -- it will go well with your black heart ! \nBarbossa indicates the plank. \nELIZABETH (CONT' D) I will not walk into the ocean. You'll have to throw me in! \nBarbossa raises an eyebrow, grins, nods. \nBARBOSSA Have at her, lads! \nTry it. It goes down rough, but it goes down - - and the second swig goes down easier. \nElizabeth considers. Comes to a decision. She unseals the bottle, takes a swig. They sit in silence for a bit. \nELIZABETH And you will call me Miss Swann. \nJack toasts her: you got it. Elizabeth studies her bottle... gives Jack a sidelong glance. Back to her bottle \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (under her breath) Drink up me hearties, yo ho... \nJACK What? What was that? (Elizabeth smiles) Something funny, Miss Swann? share. Please, \nELIZABETH Nothing ... it's nothing. Just ... I'm reminded of a song I learned as a child. A song about pirates. \nJACK I know a lot of songs about pirates, but none I'd teach a child. Let's hear it. \nELIZABETH Oh, no ... it's silly.   Back in England we didn't know   a thing about pirates, really.   They seemed so romantic and daring   - \nJack likes the way that sounds. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) (looks at him) That was before I met one, of course. \nJACK \nNow I must hear this song. An authentic pirate song. Have at it. \nELIZABETH Well, perhaps ... with a bit more to drink, I might ... \nJACK More to drink! \nHe gathers two more bottles, tosses one to her. She drops her half-finished bottle to catch it. Opens it, takes a sip. \nJACK (CONT'D) Well? \nElizabeth clears her throat, begins to sing self- consciously, becoming stronger as she goes on. \nELIZABETH We pillage, we plunder, we rifle, we loot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho. \nShe gestures for him to drink. He does. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) We kidnap and ravage and we don't give a hoot, Drink up me hearties, yo ho - \nEXT. ISLET - BEACH - LATER - NIGHT \nThe middle of the night. A fire BLAZES. Jack and Elizabeth are roaring drunk, arm in arm, singing the song all the way up to the stars -- \nJACK/ELIZABETH Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! \nYo ho, yo ho, it's a pirates life for me! \nJACK I LOVE this song! (sings) Yo ho, yo ho, a pirate's life for me! We're beggars and blighters, \nne'er do well cads, Drink up me hearties, yo ho! (gives it a touch of Irish ballad) Aye but we're loved by our mums and our dads. Drink up me hearties, yo ho! \nThey hoist their bottles, but only Jack drinks. He drains the bottle, then tosses it away. \nJACK   (CONT'D) When I get the   Black Pearl back, I'm going to teach   it to the whole crew, and we'll sing   it all the time! \nELIZABETH You'll be positively the most fearsome pirates to sail the Spanish Main. \nElizabeth salutes the idea with her bottle. Jack doesn't have a bottle to salute back. She hands him hers. He drinks, then settles shakily to the ground. Elizabeth sits beside him. \nJACK Not just the Spanish Main. The whole ocean. .. the whole world. Wherever we want to go, we go. That's what a ship is, you know. Not just a keel and a hull and a deck and sails. That's what a ship need_ ... but what a ship is -- what the Black Pearl really-is ... is freedom. \nElizabeth lays her head on his shoulder. \nELIZABETH Jack, it must be so terrible for you, to be trapped here on this island, all over again. \nJACK Ah, well... the company is better than last time. And the scenery has definitely improved. \nELIZABETH (coy) \nMr. Sparrow! I'm not sure I've had enough rum to allow that kind of talk. \nJACK We've got a few bottles left ... and we've yet to tap the kegs. \nElizabeth shrugs with a sleight -- but promising -- smile. She picks up the empty bottle from the ground, holds it up. \nELIZABETH To freedom. \nJACK To the Black Pearl. \nThey tap the bottles together. Elizabeth feigns a drink as he chugs. He taps his bottle against her again. She laughs, feigns another drink - \nEXT. ISLET - BEACH - MORNING \nCLOSE ON -- JACK'S FACE, dead asleep, lying in the sunlight. His nose twitches. A bit of SMOKE drifts by. His nose twitches again. His eyes open. \nJack GROANS and sits up. He rubs his head, looks over - \n-- all of the foliage in the middle of the island is ON FIRE. Smoke rises high up into the clear blue sky. \nJack leaps to his feet. He sees Elizabeth, as she pours out the last of the rum, dowsing a scrub brush at the base of a palm tree. It goes up in FLAMES. She rolls the barrel forward -- it starts to BURN merrily. \nThey gaze at each other for a moment. Norrington looks away. \nNORRINGTON You may seclude yourself in my cabin. I'm afraid we do not have any ladies' clothing aboard. \nELIZABETH Then I can wear men's clothing. \nNORRINGTON That would hardly be proper. \nELIZABETH Well, I am not going to stay hidden in a some cabin, 80 I suppose it's going to be heaving bosoms and bare ankles for the remainder of the voyage! \nNorrington is exasperated, but then can't help but grin - this is exactly why he loves her. She grins back at him - she's not going to change. \nNORRINGTON Murtogg, take our guest below, and find her some trousers, and a shirt. \nElizabeth smiles, allows herself to be escorted away. Norrington watches her go ... then turns his gaze to the sea. \nINT. THE BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY \nPintel enters the cell. It appears empty -- but that's because Will is hanging from the rafters, trying to shove up the ceiling planks with his legs. \nPINTEL That ain't going to work. That's the gun deck above yea \nWill drops lightly to the deck. Suddenly: \nWILL What happened to William Turner? \nPINTEL Ah, William Turner. Stupid blighter. He threw in with us after we relieved Jack Sparrow of his captaincy, but turned out, it never sat well with him- particularly after we found Cortes' treasure, and its peculiar condition. He thought we deserved to be cursed, for leaving ol' Jack to the fate we did. That's why he sent off a piece of the treasure -- to you, as it were: so it would never be recovered, and so cursed we_ remain. \nWILL And then he ran. And he's hiding out someplace where you haven't been able to find him. \nPINTEL That's a nice thought, to be sure, and I wager your da wishes he'd thought it hisself. But, no. See, what he'd done, _ didn't sit too well with Captain Barbossa ... so he chained a cannon to his legs and dumped him over. \nWill reacts with shock at the account of his father's fate. \nPINTEL (CONT'D) Yep, last I saw of Bootstrap Bill, was his face looking up, as he sank down to the crushing black oblivion of Davy Jones' locker. (sighs) It was only after, we found out we needed his blood to solve the curse. That's what you call ironic. \nBarbossa appears behind Pintel, flanked by several other pirates. He regards Will for a moment, then: \nBARBOSSA Bring him. \nEXT. H. M.. S.. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - EVENING \nJack goes to the rail and waits, pretending to look out at the sea. Elizabeth, dressed in sailor's clothes to excellent effect, joins him. \nELIZABETH You didn't tell Commodore Norrington everything. \nJACK Nor did you, I noticed. \nELIZABETH He might delay the rescue ... and that would be too late. \nJACK Exactly. \nELIZABETH These men will be facing an enemy that seemingly cannot be killed. \nJACK I have a plan. If it succeeds, then any battle will be decidedly brief ... and one-sided. \nELIZABETH What's your plan? \nLOOKOUT (O.S.) LAND HO! \nIsla de Muerta lay dark and menacing on the horizon. \nNORRINGTON Elizabeth -- below decks. I will not compromise your safety.. \nShe starts to speak; he turns away.. \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) Lieutenant, escort Elizabeth to my quarters, and make sure she stays there. \nNorrington gazes through his spyglass, at the island. Jack watches with some amusement as Elizabeth is escorted away. \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) I don't like the situation, mister Sparrow. The island is riddled with caves. I will not put my men at a disadvantage. \nJACK Funny, I was thinking   along those lines. How about you let me   go in alone, and while you're setting   up an ambush, I'll trick the pirates out   to you. \nNORRINGTON You would do that? \nJACK They left me stranded. Twice. What have you got to lose? \nNORRINGTON (looks at him) Nothing I wouldn't be please to be rid of. \nJACK (smiles) I knew you'd listen to reason! \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - CAVE ENTRANCE - EVENING \nTorches are lit. Barbossa leads Will, guarded by Pintel and a band of pirates, into the caves. \nEXT. H.M.S. DAUNTLESS - MAIN DECK - NIGHT \nA long boat is prepared to be lowered over the side. Jack wraps his pistol securely in an oilskin pouch. \nJACK That chart I drew up'11 get you past the reefs. If you're steersman's good enough, that is. \nNORRINGTON I'll be at the wheel myself. \nBARBOSSA What was begun by blood, let blood now end! \nHe raises the knife to Will's throat - \nJACK You don't want to be doing that. \nBarbossa pretends to think about his words. \nBARBOSSA No, I really think I do. \nJACK (shrugs) All right then. \nThat makes Barbossa pause. He steps out of the moonlight. \nBARBOSSA Why don't I want to do this? \nJACK Because, right about now, the H.M.S. Dauntless is lying in wait in the harbor. \nWILL Jack! \nJACK - - and its guns and crew will cut you and your men to pieces the moment you step outside these caves. \nA buzz of apprehension sweeps through the pirates. \nPINTEL Do you believe him? \nBARBOSSA No. (indicates Will) But him I believe. He is genuinely angry. \nJACK You've no hope of surviving Norrington's attack ... that is, if you're mortal. \nBARBOSSA What're you suggesting? \nJack shakes off the hands holding him, strolls toward Barbossa, Will, and the chest of coins. \nJACK Simple. Don't kill the boy yet. Wait for a more opportune moment. \nWill glares, listening to every word he says. Jack scoops up a handful of coins from the chest. \nJACK (CONT'D) (drops the coins one-by- one back into the chest) Like after you've killed... Every... Last ... One ... of Norrington's men. \nBARBOSSA I can't help wondering, Jack, why you're being so helpful and all? Last time you did that, it didn't end 80 well for you. \nJACK The situation has changed. \nBARBOSSA That so? \nJACK Aye. See, after you're done with the Royal Navy, you'll have a bit of a problem: the H.M.S. Dauntless. There you'll be, with two lovely ships on your hands, and what to do? Of course you'll decide you deserve the bigger one, and who's to argue? The Dauntless a first-rate ship-of-line, and with it, you can rule the seas. (beat) \nBut if you're Captain of the Dauntless, who's left for the Black Pearl? \nJack smiles and spreads his hands: me. \nJACK (CONT'D) I sail for you as part of your fleet, I give you fifteen percent of my plunder, and you get to introduce yourself at tea parties and brothels as 'Commodore Barbossa.' (sticks out his hand) Do we have an accord? \nBarbossa licks his lips. It's tempting ... \nJACK (CONT'D) Now, you can take care of the Dauntless, right? \nBARBOSSA Men! Are you up for it? \nThe pirates yell to the affirmative. \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) Mr. Pintel, select five men to stay here. Take the rest of the men out ... not through the caves. \nJack's expression falters; this he hadn't planned for. \nJACK There's ... another exit? \nBARBOSSA Aye, for us there is. \nEXT. LAGOON - UNDERWATER - NIGHT \nMoonlight shines down into the shallow waters, brightening coral, sparkling over the rippled sand floor. \nSuddenly all the fish SCATTER. Briefly, the waters are empty. \nAnd then FIGURES appear in the distance, seeming to waver in the shifting current. They scuffle forward, kicking up clouds of sand -- \nThe figures resolve into the skeleton PIRATES, moving silently across the lagoon floor, swords glinting. The tatters of their clothing drift in the water. Their skull heads are fixed in an endless grin. \nThe LEAD PIRATE glides forward - \nAnd stops next to a huge iron ANCHOR -- twice his' height, even buried halfway into the sand. A heavy CHAIN with barrel-sized links climbs up toward the surface - \nA SHADOW falls across the Lead Pirate -- he TRANSFORMS, and we see that it is Pintel. He looks up - \nAbove, the heavy chain leads to the giant bottom hull of the H.M.S. Dauntless, silhouetted by moonlight. \nThe huge shift drifts, again spilling moonlight below - \nAnd the pirates gathered around the anchor are once again SKELETONS, staring with upturned faces. The Pintel-skeleton puts a knife between his teeth, starts to crawl up the iron rings. \nOther pirates crowd forward, and soon the anchor-chain is clustered with skeletons - \nBARBOSSA Confound it, Jack -- I was actually beginning to like you! \nSwords are drawn, and the Pirates attack. \nJack and Will take on multiple opponents, each with his own style: Will parries, glissades and disarms with lightning fast and perfect form, while Jack uses his blade, fists, acrobatics and anything within reach to survive. \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT \nThe sailors charge. The moon emerges from behind a cloud - \nSuddenly army of SKELETON PIRATES rise up from the sea, and charge the stunned sailors -- several men are struck down - \nNORRINGTON Steady, men! Remember -- we're the Navy! \nThe sailors recover their nerve, and engage the enemy. It's a full on battle, Royal Navy against Skeleton Pirates - \nThe Navy men are driven back, surrounded - \nSuddenly there is a massive BOOM of cannon fire. Norrington, in the midst of a swordfight, tries to see - \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) What is happening out there? \nEXT. LAGOON - NIGHT \nIt's the Black Pearl, manned by Gibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton, and captained by Elizabeth, coming around the point, cannons blazing. \nEXT. H.M. S. DAUNTLESS - NIGHT \nThe pirates on the ship are caught by surprise, try to turn their cannons to this new foe - \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT \nGillette sees the Black Pearl firing on the Dauntless. \nGILLETTE They're on our side! Take heart, men! \nThe Royal Navy stand their ground and fight - \nINT. CAVE - MAIN CHAMBER - NIGHT \nOnly two pirates left: Barbossa and Jacoby. Jacoby rounds on Will; Barbossa faces off against Jack. \nBARBOSSA Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever. I think you're a fool. A mortal fool. \nJACK Remarkable how often those two traits coincide. \nJack drives him back, making Barbossa laugh. \nBARBOSSA You can't beat me, Jack. \nTo prove his point, he drops his own sword -- and catches Jack's sword with both hands. Jack can't free it. Barbossa twists the sword from Jack's grip, reverses it - \n- - AND DRIVES THE SWORD INTO JACK'S CHEST. \nWill battling Jacoby, sees it -- he smashes Jacoby in the jaw, crumpling him \nWILL Jack! \nJack stares down at the sword jutting from his chest. He takes a few steps backward, toward the Aztec gold -- when he steps into the moonlight, JACK BECOME SKELETAL. \nJACK Well, isn't that interesting. \nSkeleton Jack pulls the sword from his chest. He pulls something from his pocket: one of the Aztec coins. \nJACK (CONT' D) They're so pretty, I just couldn't resist stealing one. It's a curse, I guess. \nBarbossa grabs up his sword, and rushes Jack. Both men are in moonlight now, two skeletons in pitched battle. \nBARBOSSA So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgment Day? \nJACK Or you could surrender. \nHe shoves Barbossa back, out of the moonlight. Barbossa stalks the room, his attention focused on Jack. \nBARBOSSA Or I could chain you to a cannonball and drop you in the deepest part of the ocean, where you can contemplate your folly forever. \nBarbossa charges - \nA SHOT RINGS OUT - \nJack stands out of the moonlight, flesh and blood again, holding his smoking pistol, still aimed at Barbossa. \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) Hah. Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot. \nWILL He didn't waste it. \nWill stands over the Aztec chest, holding a bloody sword, his left hand in a fist. He opens the fist - \n-- the medallion, blood covering it, drops from his hand, revealing the cut in his palm. \nBarbossa stares, then looks down at his chest. Blood blossoms on his shirt around the bullet hole. It spreads quickly. \nBarbossa clutches his chest, his face registering pain for the first time in years. Barbossa falls heavily to the ground, dead. \n", "test1_input": "He opens the boxes, and displays for her a gorgeous velvet dress. She lets out an admiring gasp. \nELIZABETH \nIt's -- beautiful. May I inquire as to the occasion? \nSWANN Is an occasion necessary for a father to dote upon his daughter with gifts? \nElizabeth happily takes it, disappears behind a screened- off dressing area. Estrella follows, carrying the box. \nSWANN (CONT'D) Although...I did think you could wear it to the ceremony today. \nELIZABETH (O.S.) Ceremony? \nSWANN Captain Norrington's promotion ceremony. \nElizabeth peeks around the screen. \nELIZABETH I knew it. \nSWANN Or, rather, Commodore Norrington...a fine gentleman, don't you think? (no answer) He fancies you, you know. \nBehind the screen, Elizabeth GASPS. \nSWANN (CONT'D) Elizabeth?     How's it coming? \nON ELIZABETH -- She holds her hair and      the medallion (still around her neck) out of the way as the      maid cinches her into a corset over her slip. Estrella       has her foot in Elizabeth's back as she pulls the laces      tight. \nELIZABETH Difficult ... to say. \nSWANN (O.S.) I'm told that dress is the very latest fashion in London. \nELIZABETH (holding her breath) Women in London must have learned to not breath. \nEstrella is finished.   Elizabeth takes a breath -- and winces. \nA butler appears in the doorway of the room. \nBUTLER Governor? A caller is here for you. \nINT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - FOYER - DAY \nThe caller, dressed in rough clothing, stands in the foyer, looking very out of place, and knowing it. He holds a long presentation case. He polishes the toes of his boots on the back of his calves, but it doesn't help. \nSWANN Ah, Mr. Turner! It's good to see you again! \nThe caller turns -- it is WILL TURNER. Handsome, with a watchful demeanor that gives him weight beyond his years. \nWILL Good day, sir. (holds out the case) I have your order. \nSwann hurries to him, opens the case. Inside is a beautiful dress sword and scabbard. Swann takes it out reverently. \nWILL (CONT'D) \nWILL (CONT'D) The blade is folded steel. That's gold filigree laid into the handle. If I may - \nHe takes the sword from Swann, and balances it on one finger at the point where the blade meets the guard. \nWILL (CONT'D) \nPerfectly balanced. The tang is nearly the full width of the blade.. \nSWANN Impressive. .. very impressive. Commodore Norrington will be pleased, I'm sure. Do pass my compliments on to your master. \nWill's face falls. Clearly, the work is his, and he is proud of it. With practiced ease, he flips the sword around, catches it by the hilt and returns it to the case. \nWILL (bows slightly) I shall. A craftsman is always pleased to hear his work is appreciated -- \nHe stops speaking abruptly, staring past Swann - \nElizabeth stands on the stairs. Granted, the dress may be painful to wear, but holy smokes! \nSWANN Elizabeth! You look stunning! \nWill tries to speak, but can't. He gives up, smiles to himself, and simply nods emphatically. \nELIZABETH Will! It's so good to see you! \nHer hand goes to the chain around her throat (the medallion is hidden in the bodice of her dress). \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) I dreamt about you last night. Will reacts with surprise: \"Really? \nSWANN Elizabeth, this is hardly appropriate - \nELIZABETH (ignores her father) About the day we met. Do you remember? \nWILL I could never forget it, Miss Swann. \nELIZABETH Will, how many times must I ask you to call me 'Elizabeth'? \nWILL At least once more, Miss Swann. As always. \nElizabeth is disappointed and a little hurt by his response. \n", "test1_true": "Swann takes the case from Will, opens the door for Elizabeth. \nElizabeth straightens her back, gathers her skirts and strides past Will. \nELIZABETH Good day, Mr. Turner. \nEXT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - DAY \nSwann follows Elizabeth out the door. \nWILL Good day. \nHe watches as she is helped aboard a carriage by the driver. \nWILL (CONT'D) (to himself) Elizabeth. \nIN THE CARRIAGE: Swann glowers at his daughter. \nSWANN Dear, I do hope you demonstrate a bit more decorum in front of Commodore Norrington. After all, it is only \nthrough his efforts that Port Royal has become at all civilized. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - HARBOR - DAY \nThe skeletal remains of four pirates, still clad in buccaneer rags, hang from gallows erected on a rocky promontory. There is a fifth, unoccupied gallows, bearing a sign: \nPIRATES - YE BE WARNED. \nThe top of a billowing sail passes regally in front of them. On the landward face of the sail, apparently high in the rigging, is a man for whom the term 'swashbuckling rogue' was coined: Captain JACK SPARROW. \nHe gazes keen-eyed at the display as they pass. Raises a tankard in salute. Suddenly, something below catches his attention. He jumps from the rigging - \n-- and that's when we see that his is ship is not an imposing three-master, but just a small fishing dory with a single sail, plowing through the water -- the Jolly Mon. \nAnd it leaks. Which is why he has the tankard: to bail. \nJack steps back to the tiller, and using a single sheet to control the sail, and the Jolly Mon comes around the promontory, the whole of Port Royal laid out before him. \nThe huge British dreadnought, H.M.S. Dauntless dominates the bay. But Jack's attention is on a different ship: the H.M.S. Interceptor, a small sleek vessel with rail guns and a mortar in the middle of the main deck. It is tied up at the Navy landing, at the base of the cliffs below Fort Charles. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - DOCKS - DAY \nSmoothly and with no wasted movement, Jack hauls down the sail, stows it, guides the dory alongside a dock. The HARBORMASTER, a long ledger tucked under his arm, is there to catch a line and help Jack tie up. \nHARBORMASTER If you're out rolling scuppers in this tub, you're either incredibly brave or incredibly stupid. \nJACK It's remarkable how often those two traits coincide. \nHe starts up the dock, strapping on his sword belt; besides the scabbard, it also carries a compass, pistol and small powder horn. The Harbormaster cuts him off. \nHARBORMASTER It's a shilling for the dock space, and you're going to have to give me your name. \nJACK What do you say to three shillings, and we forget the name? \nHe tosses three shillings onto the ledger. The Harbormaster considers, then shuts the ledger on the coins, steps aside. \nHARBORMASTER Welcome to Port Royal, Mr. Smith. \nJack gives him a half-salute as he goes past. Looks across the water toward the Interceptor -- and smiles. Above the Interceptor, among the parapets of Fort Charles, a ceremony is underway - \nEXT. FORT CHARLES - DAY \nWith choreographed precision, Swann removes the sword and scabbard from the presentation case, held by a uniformed Navy man. He slides the sword into the scabbard, holds it out vertically to Norrington, in full dress uniform. \nNorrington grasps the scabbard above Swann's hand, and Swann lets go. Norrington draws the sword, flourishes the sword, and snaps the blade up in front of his face. Swann steps forward, pins a medal to Norrington's jacket, steps back. \nNorrington nods, turns smartly and nods to his fellow officers, turns again and nods to the audience - dignitaries, merchants, plantation owners, their families. Another flourish, and he returns the sword to its scabbard. \nThe silence is broken by loud APPLAUSE. Backslapping from the Navy men. \nIn the audience, Elizabeth doesn't look so good, out beneath the hot sun. She applauds briefly, then winces. Discreetly tries to adjust the corset through the material of the dress, then resumes clapping, trying to hide her discomfort. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - NAVY DOCK - DAY \nTwo sailors on sentry duty, MURTOGG and MULLROY, take advantage of what little shade there is on the dock. But when Jack saunters up, they are immediately on alert. \nMURTOGG This dock is off-limits to civilians. \nJACK Sorry, I didn't know. \nMusic drifts down from Fort Charles. Jack looks up, shields his eyes. \nJACK (CONT'D) Some sort of to-do up at the fort, eh? You two weren't invited? \nMURTOGG No ... someone has to make sure this dock stays off-limits to civilians. \nJACK This must be some important boat. \nMULLROY Ship. \nJACK Ship. \n", "test1_id": 261, "test2_input": "On the far side is another search party. The men nod to each other, continue on. \nA moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath the eaves of a building. He still wears the manacles. \nAcross the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thru door set in the middle. Above is a sign with a black anvil. \nINT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY \nJack slips in through the door, takes a look around: \nNo windows. The forge is dark, lit   by lanterns. Work-in- progress is scattered about: wagon   wheels, wrought iron gates, pipes -- even a cannon with   a crack in it. But every tool is in place; the workbench is   tidy and neat. \nJack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in a blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a bottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts, turns away. \nSatisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled sledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowing coke furnace in the middle of the room. \nSlowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the chain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jack sweats, grimaces at the pain - \nMoving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on the glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge, plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steam billows. \nJack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath the manacle -- but his hands are free. \nThe SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover. \nWill enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. Spots the drunken Mister Brown in the corner. \nWILL Right where I left you. \nSomething catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall. The sledge lying beside the anvil. \nWILL (CONT'D) (under his breath) Not where I left you. \nHe moves casually toward the sledge. Then grabs for it -- but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand. Will jumps back. \nJack stands there, sword leveled at Will. He backs Will up, toward the door. Will glares at him. \nWILL (CONT' D) (voice low and tight) You're the one they're hunting. The pirate. \nJack acknowledges it with a tip of his head ... then frowns, regards Will. \nJACK You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before? \nWILL I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates. \nJACK Ah. Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me ... \nBeside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in the honing guide. Before Jack can react, Will has it in hand. \nJACK (CONT'D) Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate? \nWILL You threatened Miss Swann. \nJACK Only a little. \nIn response, Will assumes an en garde position. Jack appraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing. \nJack attacks. The two men stand in one place, trading feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost impossible to follow. Will has no trouble matching Jack. \nJACK (CONT'D) You know what you're doing, I'll give you that ... Excellent form ... But how's your footwork? If I step here - \nHe takes a step around an imaginary circle. Will steps the other way, maintaining his relationship to Jack. \nJACK (CONT'D) Very good! And if I step again, you step again. . . \n(continuing to step around the circle) And so we circle, circle, like dogs we circle. . . \nThey are now exactly opposite their initial positions. \nJACK (CONT'D) Ta! \nJack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him. \nWill registers angry surprise -- and then with a vicious overhand motion, he throws his sword - \n-- the sword buries itself into the door, just above the latch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, then pulls on the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in the way. \nJack rattles the latch. Tugs on the sword a few times -- it is really stuck in there. Jack mouths a curse, but when he turns back to Will, he's smiling. \nJACK (CONT' D) That's a good trick. Except, once again, you are between me and the way out. (points his sword at the back door) And now you have no weapon. \nEyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an anvil. Jack slumps in dismay -- but then leaps forward. \nWill and Jack duel. Their blades flash and ring. Suddenly, Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at Will's head. Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed. \nThen Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming him. \nWill quickly picks up another sword. Jack becomes aware that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords, knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion. \nJACK (CONT'D) Who makes all these? \nWILL I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day. \nJACK You need to find yourself a girl. (Will sets his jaw) Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her? \n", "test2_true": "WILL No. I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate ... I can kill him. \nHe explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the air, catches it -- and attacks Jack, both blades flashing. \nJack parries with sword and chain. Jack's chain wraps around Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guard through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling - \nSo Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the ceiling. Not good. He parries using one hand, twisting and dodging around the furnace - \nJack compresses the bellows, blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKS into Will's face. Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up, kicks with his feet, knocking Will back. \nJack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the ceiling. Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second, hitting Will on the wrist. Will drops his sword, falls down, gets up - \nJack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes. \nWill steps back, directly in front of the back exit. Glares, rubs his wrist gingerly. \nWILL (CONT'D) You cheated. \nJACK \n(smiles; what do you expect?) Pirate. \nJack steps forward. Will steps back, fully blocking the door. \nJACK (CONT'D) Move away. \nWILL No. \nJACK Move! \nWILL No. I can not just step aside and let you escape. \nJack cocks the pistol. Will stares back. The stand-off lasts for a long moment. \nJACK You're lucky, boy -- this shot's not meant for you. \nJack uncocks the pistol. Will is surprised, reassesses Jack \nSuddenly, Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jack's skull. Jack crumples to the ground. \nThe front and back doors smash open, and SAILORS fill the room. Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground. \nNORRINGTON Excellent work, Mister Brown. You've aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive. \nBROWN Just doing my civic duty. \nJack groans. Norrington stands over him, smiles. \nNORRINGTON I believe you will always remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped. \nNorrington's men haul Jack away. Will watches them go. Brown looks at his bottle -- broken. \nBROWN That ratter broke my bottle. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT \nThe thick fog blankets the entire bay now, and the town. \nThe only structure visible is Fort Charles, high on the \nbluff, like a tall ship sailing a sea of grey. \nAbove the Fort is a clear black sky sprinkled with stars. A waxing moon shines, giving both Fort and fog an eerie glow. \nANGLE - FORT CHARLES, \njust below the stone parapets of the fort, visible briefly deep in the fog, like a shark fin slicing through the water: the TOPMAST of a ship, BLACK SAILS billowing. Flying from the mast is a flag with white Aztec skull. \nThe Black Pearl has come to Port Royal. \nINT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA maid removes a bed warmer from the fireplace, slides it between the sheets at the end of Elizabeth's bed. \nELIZABETH Nice and toasty. Thank you, Estrellia. \nThe maid nods, exits. Elizabeth opens a book, begins reading, toying absently with the medallion chain around her neck. \nThe lamp flame begins to diminish. Elizabeth tries to turn it up. No good. The flame goes out, and the room is black. \nINT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT \nWill, shirtless, wearing a leather apron, heats an iron ingot at the furnace, hammers it flat -- he stops. \nHis attention is drawn to the window. He opens the shutter and peers out -- nothing but fog. Almost without noticing, \nhe reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall. Takes it down; it has a satisfying weight in his hands. \nINT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: A mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in his mouth. \n", "test2_id": 262, "test3_input": "At full sail, headed out to sea. Gibbs glances at Elizabeth and Will, talking alone on the forecastle -- shakes his head. \nGIBBS Two women on board? A man don't have to be superstitious to know that's trouble. \nElizabeth holds the medallion, and finishes her tale: \nELIZABETH ... you were in danger ... so I took the medallion. And I've kept it ever since. They thought I was you, that they needed my blood. And it didn't work. \nShe hands him the medallion. \nWILL Why would my father send this to me? \nELIZABETH To keep it away from them? No pirate would sail to London, for fear of Execution Dock. \nWILL If I had known- \nELIZABETH (anticipating him) -- then we never would have met. \nWill nods. They hold each other's gaze a moment. Will turns away first, leans on the rail. Looks out to sea, back the direction they came. \nWILL I can't believe he would make such a sacrifice for us. \nELIZABETH I guess you can never truly know someone else's heart. \nWill glances at her, and nods. \nAT THE HELM, Gibbs peers forward, scanning the horizon. There \nis a tiny island in front of them. \nGIBBS Shift your heading, steer clear of that island. Fifteen degrees starboard. \nOn the aft deck, Cotton concentrates on his work, securing a halyard. Suddenly Cotton's parrot flaps its wings, takes off, lands on the starboard bulwark, squawking - \nCOTTON'S PARROT Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales! Dead men tell NO tales! \nCotton looks up - on the horizon, following: black sails. Gibbs and AnaMaria appear, and see the ship. \nANAMARIA Can we outrun them? \nGIBBS Not a chance. Make for the reef. \nEXT. CARIBBEAN OCEAN - DAY \nMiles of blue water. The Interceptor tacks, leaving a long white wake. The Black Pearl matches it -- gaining. \nEXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY \nBarbossa and Pintel eye the Interceptor, two hounds chasing the fox. \nPINTEL What's he doing? Is he going to run her aground? \nEXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY \nThe Black Pearl is now close behind the Interceptor -- and the Interceptor is headed for the island. \nGIBBS Drop the forward anchor! \nA SAILOR at the stern of the ship pulls a release, and the \nship's anchor races down into the water, the metal chain \njumping and twisting on deck. \nThe chain stops, and the Sailor locks it - \nEXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY \nWith its forward momentum and the anchor down, the Interceptor to turn quickly, pivoting around the anchor. \nEXT. BLACK PEARL - DAY \nBarbossa and Pintel watch as the huge ship brings its cannons to bear right in front of them. \nBARBOSSA All hands! Prepare to come about! \nBut for now, the Interceptor has the advantage, and takes it: \nits cannons boom, and cannonballs rain down. \nINT. BLACK PEARL - BRIG - DAY \nJack sees what he can out the porthole. In the cell with him is Twigg, acting as a guard. \nJACK Don't hit my ship! I mean, kill the lying scoundrel - (to Twigg) I'm a little conflicted, here. \nTwigg just stares. \nEXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY \nElizabeth watches  as the Black Pearl comes about -- and then there is the  low, loud RUMBLE of two dozen cannons firing as one. The  Interceptor is hit. A barrage of shots follow; most find  their mark. \nSailors dive for cover, leaving their cannons; clearly they are overmatched. \n", "test3_true": "Barbossa laughs. \nBARBOSSA Strike your colors, you bloody cockroaches! \nEXT. INTERCEPTOR - DAY \nAnother round of fire; Barbossa shows no mercy. \nANAMARIA Looks like they mean to send us under. \nGIBBS There -- she's raised the Jolly Roger, \nupside down. \nAnaMaria, Gibbs, Cotton, even Elizabeth -- all know what this means. Will doesn't. He looks to Gibbs for an explanation: \nGIBBS (CONT 'D) It's a signal. If we resist, it won't just be death. There'll be torture as well. \nWILL We're not going to just surrender! \nGIBBS That we are. \nThe Black Pearl fires again, a double-ball shot with a chain connecting the two. It hits the main mast dead ani a CRACKING, SPLINTING sound as it breaks, falls to the deck. \nBarbossa moves his ship alongside, preparing to board. \nWILL We can at least fight -- we might be able to kill a few- \nGIBBS Will -- it'll go worse for us -- for Elizabeth, especially -- if we fight. \nWill stares -- and nods. But his expression is still defiant. \nThe deck slants; the ship is sinking. pirates swarm across on ropes, and take control of the Interceptor. \nEXT. BLACK PEARL - MAIN DECK - DAY \nThe top masts of the H.M.S. Interceptor sink into the smooth' crystal waters of the Caribbean - \n-- as Will and Elizabeth, held by pirates, are brought before Barbossa -- and see that Jack stands beside him, manacled. \nGibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton and the other crewmembers huddle together. \nBarbossa's wrath falls on Elizabeth. \nBARBOSSA Welcome back, Miss. Last time on board, you played me right clever, make pretending and all. I hope your stay this time is more pleasant. Boys, show her some hospitality! \nHe shoves her into a group of pirates; they yell their approval. She is pushed from one to another. \nThis goads Will to action. He head-butts the pirate behind him, grabs a pistol, waves it at the pirates. \nWILL She goes free! \nWill leaps onto the ship's rail. He steadies himself with a hand on the rigging. Points the pistol at Barbossa. \nBARBOSSA What's in your head, boy? \nWILL She. Goes. Free. \nBARBOSSA You've got one shot -- and we can't die. \nWILL You can't. I can. \nHe leans out over the ocean. \nELIZABETH No! \nJack pushes forward. \nJACK \nWill -- don't do anything stupid! Don't say anything stupid - \nWILL My name is Will Turner, the son of Bootstrap Bill Turner. His blood runs in my veins. (raises the gun to his head) You need my blood. And on my word I will pull this trigger, and sink all the way down to Davy Jones' Locker! \nPintel squints at Will; the pirates murmur surprise. \nTWIGG It's true - he's the spittin' image of old Bootstrap. Even talks the same! \nJack drops his head. Barbossa grins at him. \nBARBOSSA Looks like you're back to having nothing to offer. \nPINTEL And hers got Old Bill's courage. A curse on him, and you! \nBarbossa steps forward. \nBARBOSSA Enough of that! (to Will) Name your terms. \nWILL Elizabeth goes free! \nBARBOSSA We got that part. Anything else? \n", "test3_id": 263}

{"test1_input": "On the far side is another search party. The men nod to each other, continue on. \nA moment, and then Jack drops from his hiding place beneath the eaves of a building. He still wears the manacles. \nAcross the street is a shop with barn doors, a pass-thru door set in the middle. Above is a sign with a black anvil. \nINT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - DAY \nJack slips in through the door, takes a look around: \nNo windows. The forge is dark, lit   by lanterns. Work-in- progress is scattered about: wagon   wheels, wrought iron gates, pipes -- even a cannon with   a crack in it. But every tool is in place; the workbench is   tidy and neat. \nJack is startled by a noise: MISTER BROWN, in a blacksmith's apron, snores in the corner, cradling a bottle. Jack gives him a hard poke. Another. Brown snorts, turns away. \nSatisfied, Jack sheathes his sword, takes a short-handled sledge from its place on the wall. Moves to the glowing coke furnace in the middle of the room. \nSlowly... he holds his right hand over the furnace, the chain down in the embers. The chain begins to GLOW. Jack sweats, grimaces at the pain - \nMoving quickly, he wraps the chain around the nose of an anvil, brings the sledge down with a fast, hard stroke on the glowing links. One SHATTERS. Jack drops the sledge, plunges his manacled hand in a bucket of water. Steam billows. \nJack pulls his hand out, flexes it. Blisters form beneath the manacle -- but his hands are free. \nThe SOUND of the latch on the door -- Jack dives for cover. \nWill enters the forge, shuts the door behind him. Spots the drunken Mister Brown in the corner. \nWILL Right where I left you. \nSomething catches his eye: an empty peg on the wall. The sledge lying beside the anvil. \nWILL (CONT'D) (under his breath) Not where I left you. \nHe moves casually toward the sledge. Then grabs for it -- but the flat of a sword blade slaps his hand. Will jumps back. \nJack stands there, sword leveled at Will. He backs Will up, toward the door. Will glares at him. \nWILL (CONT' D) (voice low and tight) You're the one they're hunting. The pirate. \nJack acknowledges it with a tip of his head ... then frowns, regards Will. \nJACK You look familiar ... Have I ever threatened you before? \nWILL I've made a point of avoiding familiarity with pirates. \nJACK Ah. Then it would be a shame to put a black mark on your record. So if you'll excuse me ... \nBeside the door is a grindstone, a sword resting in the honing guide. Before Jack can react, Will has it in hand. \nJACK (CONT'D) Do you think this is wise, boy? Crossing blades with a pirate? \nWILL You threatened Miss Swann. \nJACK Only a little. \nIn response, Will assumes an en garde position. Jack appraises him, unhappy to see Will knows what he's doing. \nJack attacks. The two men stand in one place, trading feints, thrusts and parries with lightning speed, almost impossible to follow. Will has no trouble matching Jack. \nJACK (CONT'D) You know what you're doing, I'll give you that ... Excellent form ... But how's your footwork? If I step here - \nHe takes a step around an imaginary circle. Will steps the other way, maintaining his relationship to Jack. \nJACK (CONT'D) Very good! And if I step again, you step again. . . \n(continuing to step around the circle) And so we circle, circle, like dogs we circle. . . \nThey are now exactly opposite their initial positions. \nJACK (CONT'D) Ta! \nJack turns and heads for the door, now directly behind him. \nWill registers angry surprise -- and then with a vicious overhand motion, he throws his sword - \n-- the sword buries itself into the door, just above the latch, barely missing Jack. Jack registers it, then pulls on the latch, but it won't move up -- the sword is in the way. \nJack rattles the latch. Tugs on the sword a few times -- it is really stuck in there. Jack mouths a curse, but when he turns back to Will, he's smiling. \nJACK (CONT' D) That's a good trick. Except, once again, you are between me and the way out. (points his sword at the back door) And now you have no weapon. \nEyes on Jack, Will simply picks up a new sword from an anvil. Jack slumps in dismay -- but then leaps forward. \nWill and Jack duel. Their blades flash and ring. Suddenly, Jack swings the chain still manacled to his left hand at Will's head. Will ducks it, comes up wide-eyed. \nThen Jack's chain smashes across Will's sword, disarming him. \nWill quickly picks up another sword. Jack becomes aware that the entire room is filled with bladed weapons: swords, knives, boarding axes in various stages of completion. \nJACK (CONT'D) Who makes all these? \nWILL I do. And I practice with them. At least three hours a day. \nJACK You need to find yourself a girl. (Will sets his jaw) Or maybe the reason you practice three hours a day is you've found one -- but can't get her? \n", "test1_true": "WILL No. I practice three hours a day so that when I meet a pirate ... I can kill him. \nHe explodes: kicks a rack, causing a sword to fall into his hand; uses his foot to bring his dropped sword into the air, catches it -- and attacks Jack, both blades flashing. \nJack parries with sword and chain. Jack's chain wraps around Will's sword; Will twists the handle of his guard through a link, and stabs the sword up into the ceiling - \nSo Jack's manacled left arm is now suspended from the ceiling. Not good. He parries using one hand, twisting and dodging around the furnace - \nJack compresses the bellows, blowing a SHOWER OF SPARKS into Will's face. Jack grabs the chain, hoists himself up, kicks with his feet, knocking Will back. \nJack uses his full weight, yanks the sword from the ceiling. Hurls a wooden mallet at Will, then a second, hitting Will on the wrist. Will drops his sword, falls down, gets up - \nJack's pistol is aimed directly between Will's eyes. \nWill steps back, directly in front of the back exit. Glares, rubs his wrist gingerly. \nWILL (CONT'D) You cheated. \nJACK \n(smiles; what do you expect?) Pirate. \nJack steps forward. Will steps back, fully blocking the door. \nJACK (CONT'D) Move away. \nWILL No. \nJACK Move! \nWILL No. I can not just step aside and let you escape. \nJack cocks the pistol. Will stares back. The stand-off lasts for a long moment. \nJACK You're lucky, boy -- this shot's not meant for you. \nJack uncocks the pistol. Will is surprised, reassesses Jack \nSuddenly, Mister Brown SLAMS his bottle against Jack's skull. Jack crumples to the ground. \nThe front and back doors smash open, and SAILORS fill the room. Norrington pushes forward, sees Jack on the ground. \nNORRINGTON Excellent work, Mister Brown. You've aided in the capture of a dangerous fugitive. \nBROWN Just doing my civic duty. \nJack groans. Norrington stands over him, smiles. \nNORRINGTON I believe you will always remember this as the day Captain Jack Sparrow almost escaped. \nNorrington's men haul Jack away. Will watches them go. Brown looks at his bottle -- broken. \nBROWN That ratter broke my bottle. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - NIGHT \nThe thick fog blankets the entire bay now, and the town. \nThe only structure visible is Fort Charles, high on the \nbluff, like a tall ship sailing a sea of grey. \nAbove the Fort is a clear black sky sprinkled with stars. A waxing moon shines, giving both Fort and fog an eerie glow. \nANGLE - FORT CHARLES, \njust below the stone parapets of the fort, visible briefly deep in the fog, like a shark fin slicing through the water: the TOPMAST of a ship, BLACK SAILS billowing. Flying from the mast is a flag with white Aztec skull. \nThe Black Pearl has come to Port Royal. \nINT. GOVERNOR'S MANSION - ELIZABETH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA maid removes a bed warmer from the fireplace, slides it between the sheets at the end of Elizabeth's bed. \nELIZABETH Nice and toasty. Thank you, Estrellia. \nThe maid nods, exits. Elizabeth opens a book, begins reading, toying absently with the medallion chain around her neck. \nThe lamp flame begins to diminish. Elizabeth tries to turn it up. No good. The flame goes out, and the room is black. \nINT. BLACKSMITH'S FORGE - NIGHT \nWill, shirtless, wearing a leather apron, heats an iron ingot at the furnace, hammers it flat -- he stops. \nHis attention is drawn to the window. He opens the shutter and peers out -- nothing but fog. Almost without noticing, \nhe reaches for a boarding axe hanging on the wall. Takes it down; it has a satisfying weight in his hands. \nINT. CELL BLOCK - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON: A mutt of a dog, holding a ring of keys in his mouth. \n", "test1_id": 261, "test2_input": "EXT. CARIBBEAN SEA - DAY \nThe Interceptor cuts across the waves. Jack at the wheel; Will tightens a line, moves back astern. \nEXT. INTERCEPTOR - MAIN DECK - DAY \nWill sharpens his sword with a whetstone: shhhk -- shhhk \nJACK For a man whose made an industry of avoiding boats, you're a quick study. \nWILL I worked passage   from England as a cabin boy. (an attempt  at guile) After my mother  passed, I came out here ... looking  for my father. \nJACK Is that so? \nWILL My father. William Turner? \nJack says nothing. Will has lost the patience for guile. \nWILL ( CONT ' D) I'm not a simpleton. At the jail - - it was only after you learned my name that you agreed to help. (a smile) Since that's what I wanted, I didn't press the matter. But now - \n{an accusation} \nYou knew my father. \nJack considers his reply -- settles on 'truth.' \nJACK I knew him. Probably one of the few who knew him as William Turner. Most everyone just called him Bill, or 'Bootstrap' Bill. \nWILL 'Bootstrap?' \nJACK Good man. Good pirate. And clever -\"- I never met anyone with as clever a mind and hands as him. When you were puzzling out that cell door, it was like seeing his twin. \nWILL (angry) That's not true. \nJACK I swear, you look just like him. \nWILL It's not true that my father was a pirate. \nJACK Figured you wouldn't want to hear it. \nWILL He was a merchant marine! He was a respectable man who obeyed the law, and followed the rules-- \nJACK (laughs) You think your father is the only man who ever lived the Glasgow life, telling folk one thing, and then going off to do another? There's quite a few who come here, hoping to amass enough swag to ease the burdens of respectable \nlife. And they're all 'merchant marines.' \nWILL My father did not think of my mother -his family -- as a burden. \nJACK Sure -- because he could always go pirating. \nWILL My father -- was not -- a pirate! \nWill's sword is out, levelled at Jack. Jack gives him a disbelieving look, sighs. \nJACK Put it away, Will. It's not worth getting beat again. \nWILL You didn't beat me. You ignored the rules of engagement. In a fair fight, I'd kill you. \nJACK Then that's not much incentive for me to fight fair, is it? \nHe kicks a lever on a wench. The sail boom whips around and slams Will in the chest -- sweeping him off the ship. His sword clatters onto the deck. Will dangles above the water. \nJack slips a loop of rope around the wheel to hold the course. Picks up the sword -- and pokes at Will with it. Will hand-over-hands away from the blade, to the end of the boom. \nJACK ( CONT ' D) As long as you're just hanging there, pay attention. Must, Should, do, don't, shall, shall not -- those are just suggestions. There are only two absolute rules. (ticks them off on his fingers) \nJACK (CONT'D) What a man can do. And what a man can I t do. \nWill looks away, not interested. \nJACK (CONT'D) For instance: you can accept that your father was a pirate and still a good man... or you can't. Now me, I can sail this ship to Tortuga, by myself. . . (Will looks alarmed) But I can't just let you drown. \nJack swings the boom back in. Will drops to the deck. Jack holds the hilt of the sword out. Will takes it. Glares at Jack, considers what he'll do next. Jack watches him coolly. \nWill turns and strides to his spot on the deck, sits down, and resumes sharpening his sword: shhhk -- shhhk -- shhhk \nJack breathes silent sigh of relief. Notices his hand is shaking -- he takes the wheel. \nWILL Tortuga? \nJACK Oh -- did I forget to mention that? \nEXT. TORTUGA - DAY \nA dank and dirty port, where the tides seem to have swept together the scum of the Caribbean -- pirates, privateers, prostitutes, thieves, and drunkards. \nWith its cantered, rotting docks, weatherbeaten buildings, and odd assortment of livestock running free -- a donkey, chickens, etc. -- it is far less civilized than Port Royal. \nJack and Will move through the crowd. A REDHEADED woman turns her head -- she has noticed Jack. \nJACK \nWe need a crew. We can manage the ship between islands, but the open sea, that's another matter - \n", "test2_true": "WILL Just do it quickly. \nJACK (rubbing his jaw) Don't worry. I've already got my Quartermaster -- there! \nJack leads Will toward a pub: the Faithful Bride, the emblem over the door a politically incorrect painting of a smiling woman holding a bouquet in her chained-and-manacled hands. \nJack pulls open the door; Will goes inside passing a pretty ASIAN women coming out -- she sees Jack and immediately SLAPS him, cursing something in Chinese. Jack backs away - \nINT. THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - DAY \nJack closes the door on the woman, joins Will. They take in the place -- it is populated with a slightly higher class of scum. Jack spots a BARTENDER, smiles, moves forward - \n--and is suddenly DECKED by a waitress. This is ANAMARIA, tall, strong, tough; she didn't spill a drink off her tray. \nANAMARIA You stole my boat. \nJACK AnaMaria! Have you seen Gibbs? I need to put together - \nShe SLAPS him again. Will shakes his head, heads for the bar. Jack gets up. \nJACK (CONT'D) Borrowed. Borrowed your boat. (off her look) Without permission. \nAnaMaria charges; Jack backs away, puts a table between them. She chases him around the table, still carrying the tray. \nANAMARIA My dory. The Jolly Mon. Where is it? \nJACK Safe! At Port Royal. With the Royal Navy. \nANAMARIA That boat is my livelihood! \nJACK You'll get it back. Or one better. \nANAMARIA (a threat) I will. \nAway from them, a PATRON calls for his food. AnaMaria scowls at Jack, moves away -- comes back for. one more SLAP! \nWILL Jack! Over here! \nAT THE BAR, Will has spoken to the Bartender. Jack arrives, rubbing his chin. \nWILL (CONT'D) He knows Gibbs. \nThe Bartender nods 'yes.' Then nods 'out back.' Then produces a water bucket from behind the bar. \nJack and Will exchange a look,-and Jack takes the bucket. \nEXT. THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - REAR - DAY \nA drunken man lays in the mud, having a friendly conversation with two pigs. He wears an old tattered Navy jacket. \nA sudden SPRAY OF WATER splashes across his face, revealing: this is old JOSHAMEE GIBBS (the man who told \npirate stories to Elizabeth when she was a child). He sputters and roars: \nGIBBS Curse you for breathing, you slack-jawed idiot (recognizes Jack) Mother's love, Jack, you know better than to wake a man when he's sleeping. It's bad luck! \nJACK Well, fortunately, I know how to counter it. The man who did the waking buys the man who was sleeping a drink, and the man who was sleeping it drinks it while listening to a proposition. \nGIBBS Aye, that'll about do it. \nJack helps Gibbs to his feet -- and then Gibbs is hit with a second wave of water. Will stands there with the bucket. \nGIBBS (CONT'D) Blast it, I'm already awake! \nWILL I know. That was for the smell. \nINT. THE FAITHFUL BRIDE - DAY \nJack and Gibbs sit at a table in the shadows, a single candle illumining them, speaking in hushed voices. Will is away from them, at the door, hand on sword, keeping a look- out. \nA tankard is set down. Gibbs lifts it to take a swig - \nJACK Just the one. \nGibbs pauses. He takes a dainty sip. \nGIBBS Make it_ast, then. Now, what's the nature of this venture of yours? \nJACK \nFirst -- have you found me a crew? \nGIBBS Oh, there's a hard tale, Jack. Most of the decent pirates in town won't sail with you -- seem to think you're a jinx. \nJACK Now where, I wonder, would they have gotten that idea? \nGibbs evades answering by taking a long sip. Jack leans forward. Gibbs leans forward. \nJACK (CONT'D) I'm going after the Black Pearl. \nGibbs straightens up like he's been hit. He stares. He reaches for the drink as if to down it -- but then sets it back down. He leans forwards again. Jack has not moved. \n", "test2_id": 262, "test3_input": "BARBOSSA Confound it, Jack -- I was actually beginning to like you! \nSwords are drawn, and the Pirates attack. \nJack and Will take on multiple opponents, each with his own style: Will parries, glissades and disarms with lightning fast and perfect form, while Jack uses his blade, fists, acrobatics and anything within reach to survive. \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT \nThe sailors charge. The moon emerges from behind a cloud - \nSuddenly army of SKELETON PIRATES rise up from the sea, and charge the stunned sailors -- several men are struck down - \nNORRINGTON Steady, men! Remember -- we're the Navy! \nThe sailors recover their nerve, and engage the enemy. It's a full on battle, Royal Navy against Skeleton Pirates - \nThe Navy men are driven back, surrounded - \nSuddenly there is a massive BOOM of cannon fire. Norrington, in the midst of a swordfight, tries to see - \nNORRINGTON (CONT'D) What is happening out there? \nEXT. LAGOON - NIGHT \nIt's the Black Pearl, manned by Gibbs, AnaMaria and Cotton, and captained by Elizabeth, coming around the point, cannons blazing. \nEXT. H.M. S. DAUNTLESS - NIGHT \nThe pirates on the ship are caught by surprise, try to turn their cannons to this new foe - \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT \nGillette sees the Black Pearl firing on the Dauntless. \nGILLETTE They're on our side! Take heart, men! \nThe Royal Navy stand their ground and fight - \nINT. CAVE - MAIN CHAMBER - NIGHT \nOnly two pirates left: Barbossa and Jacoby. Jacoby rounds on Will; Barbossa faces off against Jack. \nBARBOSSA Just so you know, Jack -- I don't think you're that clever. I think you're a fool. A mortal fool. \nJACK Remarkable how often those two traits coincide. \nJack drives him back, making Barbossa laugh. \nBARBOSSA You can't beat me, Jack. \nTo prove his point, he drops his own sword -- and catches Jack's sword with both hands. Jack can't free it. Barbossa twists the sword from Jack's grip, reverses it - \n- - AND DRIVES THE SWORD INTO JACK'S CHEST. \nWill battling Jacoby, sees it -- he smashes Jacoby in the jaw, crumpling him \nWILL Jack! \nJack stares down at the sword jutting from his chest. He takes a few steps backward, toward the Aztec gold -- when he steps into the moonlight, JACK BECOME SKELETAL. \nJACK Well, isn't that interesting. \nSkeleton Jack pulls the sword from his chest. He pulls something from his pocket: one of the Aztec coins. \nJACK (CONT' D) They're so pretty, I just couldn't resist stealing one. It's a curse, I guess. \nBarbossa grabs up his sword, and rushes Jack. Both men are in moonlight now, two skeletons in pitched battle. \nBARBOSSA So what now, Jack Sparrow? Are we to be two immortals, locked in epic battle until the trumpets of Judgment Day? \nJACK Or you could surrender. \nHe shoves Barbossa back, out of the moonlight. Barbossa stalks the room, his attention focused on Jack. \nBARBOSSA Or I could chain you to a cannonball and drop you in the deepest part of the ocean, where you can contemplate your folly forever. \nBarbossa charges - \nA SHOT RINGS OUT - \nJack stands out of the moonlight, flesh and blood again, holding his smoking pistol, still aimed at Barbossa. \nBARBOSSA (CONT'D) Hah. Ten years you carried that pistol, and you end up wasting your shot. \nWILL He didn't waste it. \nWill stands over the Aztec chest, holding a bloody sword, his left hand in a fist. He opens the fist - \n-- the medallion, blood covering it, drops from his hand, revealing the cut in his palm. \nBarbossa stares, then looks down at his chest. Blood blossoms on his shirt around the bullet hole. It spreads quickly. \nBarbossa clutches his chest, his face registering pain for the first time in years. Barbossa falls heavily to the ground, dead. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT \nMurtogg FIRES a pistol at a pirate. The pirate is hit, screams in pain, and crumples to the ground. Mullroy runs through another with his sword. \nThe pirates react to the sight, and quickly realize their peril. They set their weapons down in surrender. \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - LAGOON - NIGHT \nThe Black Pearl comes alongside the Dauntless, and Jack's crew swarm across, overwhelming the pirates. \nThe sailors on the beach see it, and CHEER. \nINT. ISLA DE MUERTE - CAVE - MAIN CAVERN - NIGHT \nWill wraps a cloth around his palm; Jack joins him near the chest. \nWILL Well, you're the worst pirate I've ever heard of. (smiles) You're a man who can be trusted, who can be counted on, and who can It betray his friends. What kind of pirate is that? \nJACK (admits it) The worst. (beat) On the other hand, maybe I'm a man who can't pass up a chance for revenge against the black-hearted bastard who stole my ship and left me to die in the middle of the ocean -- twice! -- and who knows how to get what he wants. Now that's a great pirate. \nJack cuts his palm, grips the coin he stole above the chest ... and then hesitates. \nWill looks at him... \nJack releases the coin. It lands in the chest beside the other bloody coin. \nSuddenly, the lid of the chest, all on its own, SLAMS SHUT. Elizabeth stares at it. \nWILL Let's get out of here. \nEXT. ISLA DE MUERTA - BEACH - NIGHT - LATER \nJack, Will, and Norrington gather together on the beach. Elizabeth calls out: \nELIZABETH You're all right! \nThe three men turn as one. An awkward moment -- which of them does she mean? \nElizabeth races across the sand, toward them -- and straight to Will. She throws her arms around his neck in a hug. \nWILL Miss Swann -- are you wearing trousers? And how did you get off the island? \nElizabeth can't believe that's what he noticed. Indignant, she steps away from him. \nELIZABETH Yes, I am wearing trousers. And as for how we got off the island -- ah, that's a grand adventure, but now is not the time to talk about it. \nShe reaches a hand behind his neck, decisively kisses him. \nELIZABETH (CONT'D) There. And don't you dare tell me that wasn't a proper kiss! \nWILL Elizabeth, I think it doesn't matter- that we are of a different class - \nELIZABETH It doesn't! \nWILL -- but that was not a proper kiss. \nPure consternation on Elizabeth's face - \nWILL (CONT'D) This is a proper kiss. \nWill sweeps her in his arms, leans her back, and kisses her long and well - \nJack puts a hand on Norrington's shoulder. \nJACK Tough luck. I was rooting for you. \nEXT. PORT ROYAL - FORT CHARLES - DAY \nClose on: Will's face, stoic, staring forward. He stands straight and unmoving. Around him are members of the Royal Navy, standing before for a group of witnesses from town. \nIt is the courtyard on the top of Fort Charles. A trial is underway -- with Will as the defendant. \nNORRINGTON ...and though I do say so with regret, the law is clear. The penalty for piracy is death by hanging. \nIn the crowd, Elizabeth squeezes the hand of her father, Swann. She lets go as Swann stands. \nSWANN By your leave, I wish to speak on behalf of the boy. (a glance at Elizabeth) It is clear that these deeds were performed out of a sincere desire   to do good, at great personal risk. It   seems to me, that in the rare occasion   where the right course is committing an   act of piracy, then an act of piracy   is the right course! (cheers of approval) So in my capacity as Governor, I   intend to grant a pardon to -- \nGILLETTE Sir! \nAll eyes turn. Gillette stands at the top of a stairway. \nGILLETTE (CONT'D) Jack and his crew have escaped! (gasps from the crowd) There was no damage to the cell ... they must have been set free. \nWill and Elizabeth exchange looks. You? Not me, you? No, not me either! Swann notices something the parapet, points \nSWANN The Black Pearl! \nPeople rush to the parapet. Sure enough, below in the bay are the distinctive black sails of the Pearl. The ship cuts through the waters very close to the point - \n-- where the gallows of the pirates are. Suddenly Jack appears, on the point; he swings off the one empty gallows, across and down onto the ship's rigging as it passes. \n", "test3_id": 263}

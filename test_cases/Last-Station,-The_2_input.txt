VALENTIN I don't. Not at all...I think sexual activity...how men and women combine their physical parts is completely neutral. 
MASHA Listen to you. You're a prig. Just like Sergeyenko. Why else would they have hired you? 
VALENTIN That's not fair 
MASHA I don't care if it's fair. It's true...neutral...my God... 
VALENTIN I'm going. 
He puts down the axe. 
MASHA Do as you like. 
She goes back to chopping. We track in front of him as he walks toward the house. The chopping stops. 
MASHA Valentin Fedorovich. 
He stops, relieved and turns to face her. 
MASHA You forgot your horse. 
VALENTIN Yes. You know, I think that I... never mind. 
He hesitates for a moment, then starts toward her. Her back is to him. She begins to chop again. The color rises in his face as he tries to salvage a little dignity. 
He grabs the reins and starts again toward the buildings, trips in a ditch, almost falls flat. Red faced, he rights himself. The chopping behind him remains constant. Sergeyenko watches him from the porch.

Sofya walks into the house with another stack of mail. Sasha comes piling down the stairs. 
SASHA Where's papa? 
Without waiting for the answer, Sasha races past her and out the door

Valentin and Tolstoy walk together in the woods. . 
TOLSTOY I couldn't write. I was distracted I think...I had a dream last night, about a Tartar girl I knew in the war. 
VALENTIN A girl who died? 
TOLSTOY No, no...A girl I had sexual intercourse with... Sometimes we did it twice a day. 
Valentin sneezes. 
TOLSTOY God bless...I've never forgotten our time together, the position of our bodies, the taste of her... 
VALENTIN You shouldn't torture yourself. It was a long time ago. 
Tolstoy laughs out loud. 
TOLSTOY Torture? You are a virgin, aren't you. 
VALENTIN I try to...you know, to... 
TOLSTOY To be what, a good Tolstoyan? 
Tolstoy smiles. 
TOLSTOY You see, I myself am not a very good Tolstoyan. You should think twice about asking my advice about anything... Torture... (he laughs) 
VALENTIN Are you alright? 
TOLSTOY Kalya, her name was...She's an old woman now, white hair, old body like me. She'd hardly remember my name, I suspect. She may even be dead. (beat) Do you think that meant something? 
VALENTIN What do you mean? 
TOLSTOY I mean that little romance. Was there some meaning to it?

Heave! 
[the two men throw the carried man off the balcony, then Jack continues on his way] 
[the music stops, Norrington threateningly holds a bottle in his left hand] 
NORRINGTON Come on, men! Who wants some? Form an orderly line, I'll have you all one by one. Come on, who's first? 
[from behind, Elizabeth grabs the bottle from Norrington, smashes it over his head, knocking him out] 
ELIZABETH SWANN I just wanted the pleasure of doing that myself! 
[the crowd cheers, and everyone holds up their mugs in a toast] 
[men throw Norrington into the mud with some pigs, the crowd leaves except for Elizabeth] 
[Elizabeth turns Norrington over, onto his back] 
ELIZABETH SWANN James Norrington.  What has the world done to you? 
[Mercer observes Elizabeth and Norrington from the doorway of the tavern] 
Flying Dutchman 
[Jones plays his pipe organ with his tentacles, steam coming from pipes] 
[the crew are on desk, slaving away, pulling rhythmically on a rope] 
Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! Heave! 
BO'SUN Secure the mast tackle, Mister Turner! 
BO'SUN Step ?to-it/?tight! 
[Will goes to grab a rope] 
WILL TURNER Step aside! 
BO'SUN ?Regain-?yourselves!/?Mind-?yourself! 
[Bootstrap sees that the other man at the rope is his son, Bootstrap is stunned] 
[Bootstrap lets go of the rope, Will attempts to grab the sliding rope] 
[the cannon's rope drags Will across the deck] 
[the hoisted cannon crashes to the deck, and the organ music stops] 
BO'SUN Haul that weevil to his feet! 
[the crew haul Will to his feet] 
BO'SUN Five lashes to remind you... to stay on 'em! 
BO'SUN Impeding me in my duties. You'll share the punishment. 
DAVY JONES Will you now? And what would prompt such an act of charity? 
DAVY JONES Ha ha ha ha! Ha ha! What fortuitous circumstance be this! Five lashes be owed. I believe it is. 
[Jones hands the whip to Bootstrap, Jones' tentacle curls around the shaft of it] 
DAVY JONES The cat's out of the bag, Mister Turner. Your issue will feel its sting be it the Bo'sun's hand, by your own. 
DAVY JONES Bo'sun! 
[Bootstrap reluctantly takes the whip] 
[two crewmen tear Will's shirt off, exposing his bare back] 
[Bootstrap whips Will's back five times] 
[Will is tossed into a lower part of the deck, partially filled with water] 
[Will stands up, wearing an intact white shirt] 
BO'SUN You had it easy, boy! Ha ha ha!

IN THE PRISON LEVEL 
The two ANCIENT WORKERS continue their carpentry. The planks cover more of the opening. BAM-BAM-BAM. 
Covers more of Ripley. BAM-BAM-BAM. She stares... 
ON THE ROOF OF THE ABBEY 
Planks are rising around the ship. Covering it.  Locking away the good omen turned evil. 
IN THE LIBRARY 
John and Mattias sit before an open book. He doesn't read.  He can hear the POUNDING of the hammers. It seems to reverberate THROUGH the planet. Through his SKULL. He closes his eyes in pain. 
RIPLEY 
Only her face is visible. Another board. BAM-BAM-BAM. Then just her eyes. 
Just before the last plank is put in place -- 
WORKER Here you go, woman.  Something from your ship.  Something to keep you company -- 
He tosses it into the cell.  Ripley catches it. Watches as the last of the light is covered over. BAM-BAM...BAM. 
She continues to stare at the once open wall as her eyes grow accustomed to the darkness.  The little light creeping between the planks grows in intensity until it is soon enough to see what it is she has caught -- 
NEWT'S DOLL'S HEAD. 
Ripley looks around her cell -- actually a narrow space behind other cells, one wall curved out -- like a narrow slice crossways towards the edge of the pie. Looks at the Doll's head in her hand. A beat. 
She FREAKS OUT --! 
RIPLEY You fucking idiots!  You're dead! You're all dead! 
BEATS the walls.  KICKS. SMASHES her HEAD against the wall. Again. Her nose starts to bleed. Her hand goes to her nose. She squints in the darkenss. Sees the BLOOD. Tastes the iron taste in her mouth. Death is with her again. 
RIPLEY (sotto) Dead... 
The "widest" part of her cell, the middle, allows her to slide down into a sitting position.  She does. 
RIPLEY Christ.  Jesus Christ.  It's here.  Here. Shit.  Here.  I can't get rid of it... 
Looks at the Doll's head -- 
RIPLEY Newt.  This isn't what I wanted... 
She throws the doll's head away -- It bounces off the wall and rolls back to an upright position so that it is staring at her. 
RIPLEY (snaps) Don't stare at me! 
Beat. 
VOICE O/S Sorry. 
Ripley looks down at the base of the wall facing her -- Where it meets the floor, in the rotting timbers: A HOLE.  In it: 
A MAN'S FACE 
Bright, wrinkled eyes beneath a snowy white crew cut. He's looking back at her. 
ON THE ROOF OF THE MONASTERY - NIGHT 
The Sulaco escape pod #4 is now a memory as the Monks have finished walling it up.  Now just another part of the Abbey. 
As the Monks move down the thin wooden ladders we follow -- Pass them -- down to an open window and into... 
INT. LIBRARY - THE MEDIEVAL SECTION - NIGHT INTO DAWN 
John is here, Mattias asleep at his feet. The tables, the benches, the floor are COVERED with hundreds of books he's pulled off the shelves, their chains all TANGLED. All open to -- 
PICTURES OF DEVILS 
Different representations of Evil through the ages -- Lucifer, Shaitan, Ahriman, Asmodeus -- Satan. "The Temptation of Christ" from the Master of Schloss Lichtenstein.  Satan roasting on an enormous grill from "Tres riches heures du Duc de Berry." 
The devil as a serpent.  As a semi-humanoid. Gruenwald's "Temptation of St. Anthony." Pacher's "Saint Wolfgang and the Devil." A miasma of Medieval Monsters. 
JOHN 
Picks his way through the mess.  Like a man possessed he fumbles through book after book.

CHARLES Don't give in, Beth. I've got your back. 
MAX You owe me. Remember when you threw that egg at me in the dining hall? 
BETH Okay, I'll get up. But I'm ordering an omelet. 
She sits down next to Charles and they smile at each other. 
29 EXT. ATM NEAR THEATER Â­ LATER 29 
Max walks down the street toward an ATM, where a long line of college students has formed. Next to the ATM is an arthouse theater. The marquee reads "Thru Valentine's Day: ANNIE HALL and CASABLANCA." 
He joins the ATM line. A moment later, Julie walks by. She notices him and stops. 
JULIE Hi. Look at this line. 
MAX Oh, hey. Yeah, I hate coming here this time of day, but I need money. You know, gambling debts and all. 
JULIE Aren't ATMs great? They save so much time. Think about what life must have been like before them. 
MAX I can't support an acronym without knowing what it stands for. I once joined NAMBLA because I thought it was an animal rights group. 
She laughs. 
MAX (CONT'D) So, are you a junior, too? 
JULIE I'm listed as a sophomore, but I've taken some time off. 
MAX What're you majoring in? 
JULIE Why is that always the first question? 
MAX It was my second question. 
JULIE And how would you answer it? 
MAX I'd be honest. Oh, wait. Media Studies. This week, I'm majoring in Media Studies. I used to be a double-major, Renaissance Footwear and Neurosurgery, but, ya know, it was just too hard to get course credit for watching movies. 
JULIE I bet. Me, I'm in Soc., but I'm leaning toward Business, or Psych. Or Art History. 
MAX Why don't you just be undeclared? 
JULIE Not my style. 
Max's turn-- but he spots ANNIE HALL on the marquee. Impulsively, he turns Julie to face him, so that her back is to it. In doing so, he steps away from the ATM. 
JULIE (CONT'D) Are you okay? I thought you needed money. 
MAX Uh, I forgot, my bookie takes checks now. 
JULIE Seriously, is everything okay? 
MAX Actually, yes. But I need something from you. 
JULIE What? 
MAX Your name. 
JULIE It's Julie, no nickname. Don't even think of calling me "Jewel." 
MAX Okay, Julie with no nickname, I, um, I'll see you around? 
JULIE Probably. 
She leaves. Max goes back to the end of the line. 
30 INT. COMMON ROOM -- NIGHT 30 
Lounging are Max and Charles, Sam and Tommy, and Scott and Amanda. 
Charles pulls a bottle of vodka from a newsbox. 
CHARLES Come on, which of you cats is in? 
MAX It's only Monday. 
CHARLES Shit, it's only Monday? Now I really need a drink. 
SAM I'm in.

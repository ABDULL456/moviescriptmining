WILLS I didn't mean to run off like that. 
LISA But you did. 
An awkward silence. 
LISA So you got my letter. What'd you do? Freak out? Burn it? 
WILLS I saved it. 
LISA I was just blowing off some steam, okay? I think I have the right. 
WILLS So do I. Look, why don't we go upstairs. 
LISA (uneasily) No. I didn't plan to come. Peter... my husband... he agrees. He thinks it's a futile exercise. But it turns out I'm pregnant. Just a few months, but -- 
WILLS Lisa -- Congratulations. That's wonderful. 
His sincerity stops her. She softens slightly, mustering a tiny smile -- 
LISA Thanks. Anyway, I guess it made me want to meet you. I've been a little sentimental about parent-hood. 
WILLS Is that what you consider me? 
LISA In a lousy absentee sorta way, sure. 
Pause. 
WILLS How's your mom? 
LISA Great. Nuts. She moved to Costa Rica last summer. 
WILLS Why? 
LISA A guy, what else? He owns a charter airline and wears sunglasses indoors. I think he might be a gunrunner. 
Wills chuckles. For the first time, Lisa relaxes enough to take him in. 
LISA You know, you're much better looking in person than in photographs. I always assumed Mom was exaggerating, but she wasn't. 
WILLS Thanks. You're not bad looking yourself. 
Lisa smiles, and, much to her embarrassment, tears come to her eyes. She shakes her head at how absurd she is, treasuring kind words from a father she doesn't know. 
LISA Anyway... I should go... 
WILLS Already? 
LISA I really just wanted to meet you and... maybe... I don't know... 
WILLS (gently) What is it? Tell me. 
She sniffles and looks away -- 
LISA Nothing earth-shattering. Maybe just to hear you say you were sorry. 
Silence. 
WILLS I am. I'm very sorry. 
She stares at him long and hard, waiting for some more palpable sign of remorse. It isn't forthcoming. Finally, she nods. 
LISA Okay. Thanks. 
She turns and walks away. His voice stops her -- 
WILLS Can I call you? 
She turns around, hesitates for a moment, then nods. She continues to the door. But then she stops and turns -- 
LISA Before... when you came in... who did you think I was? 
WILLS A friend. 
LISA You must like her an awful lot. 
She smiles simply and heads for the door. When she is gone, Wells slowly walks back toward the elevators, but then abruptly stops in his tracks, deliberating... 
EXT. VILLAGE -- DAWN 
THE CAMERA CRANES DOWN SLOWLY from a view of the sun rising in the EASTERN SKY to a TAXI gliding over to the curb in front of... 
CHARLOTTE'S BROWNSTONE -- DAWN 
Charlotte, looking tired and a little pale, pays the driver and emerges from the taxi. She makes her way up the steps. 
INT. BROWNSTONE -- CONTINUOUS

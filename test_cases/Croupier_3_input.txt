The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She hands him the chip. 
WOMAN Bring me some luck. 
The YOUNG MAN smiles. Takes the chip and puts it on 21. 
The MIDDLE-AGED MAN puts his chips on 8 and 11. He prays silently. 
INT. CASINO - NIGHT 
The roulette table. The ball is bouncing in and out of numbers. 
JACK No more bets. 
The MIDDLE-AGED MAN closes his eyes. The WOMAN puts her hand on the YOUNG MAN'S arm. 
JACK'S VOICE Next stage. He had to be secure at 8 to 1 against having to give the money back, so he wouldn't spend it. If after one month no one had approached him, he calculated the odds of keeping it at 20 to 1. After three months he figured 100 to 1 no one would turn up. 
The ball bounces into 21. The WOMAN gives a cry of joy. She grips the YOUNG MAN's hand. He leans over to her, eyeing her diamond necklace, and whispers something seductive in her ear. She stiffens with apprehensive pleasure. 
The MIDDLE-AGED MAN opens his eyes, there is a look of misery on his face. 
JACK sweeps away the lost chips, pays out five minor winners. He calmly counts a small pile of chips and slides them to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN by sleight of hand. Then he prepares to pay out the WOMAN. 
No one has noticed the pay-out to the MIDDLE-AGED MAN. The MAN looks at JACK incredulously. JACK smiles mechanically. The MAN mouths the words 'Thank you' to JACK. 
The WOMAN looks up at the YOUNG MAN. She gives him a pile of chips. He gives them back. He kisses her neck. 
YOUNG MAN How about a drink to celebrate? 
The MIDDLE-AGED MAN stands up, his face creased in emotion, relief. 
MAN (to Jack) Cash me in. 
JACK converts the green coloured chips to £35 in house chips. The MAN nods at JACK, who smiles formally. 
The MAN leaves the table. PUNTERS place their bets for the next spin. JACK sees the MAN stop by the next roulette table. 
JACK'S VOICE Jake's experiment with the man would prove the point. 
The MAN hesitates. He can't resist. 
In CLOSE-UP: the MAN puts two of the chips down. 
JACK'S VOICE People don't change. 
INT. JACK'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
MARION drops a plate as she's drying the dishes. She swears and bends to pick up the pieces. 
INT. JACK'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
MARION, undressed, pulls the old nightgown from the laundry basket. She lets it fall back, goes to look in the chest of drawers for another. She can't find one among the underwear. 
She goes on to JACK'S drawer and pulls out a shirt. She unfolds it. Out drop the four packets of £2500. 
She bends to pick them up. She looks at them incredulously. 
INT. CASINO - BLACKJACK TABLE - NIGHT 
JACK pushes several £50 notes into the slot and counts out two piles of chips for a PUNTER in front of him. 
JACK'S VOICE He watched their faces as they lost hour after hour, night after night, relentlessly. 
JACK'S FACE as he deals. 
JACK'S VOICE He questioned the conventional wisdom that gamblers are self- destructive... 
INT. CASINO - ROULETTE TABLE - NIGHT 
The FACES of PUNTERS around the table: concentration, grimness, apprehension... 
JACK'S VOICE He had come to believe that in reality, they want to destroy everyone else - their families and loved ones, everyone. Fuck over the whole world...

INT. STORAGE MODULE - NIGHT It's dark. A duck-shape scuttles along the floor, casting flickering shadows on the wall (duck 2, framed larger) Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   60. 
GARY (O.S.) Gggrrrrroooarr!

INT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT Tilda opens a compartment and locates sandwiches. Jimmy sits tinkering with the busted laser pistol through the scene. Valentina takes the sandwiches. JIMMY So it's some kind of animal? ANTON Yes. And it's growing. JIMMY How big is it? ANTON Like a small dog maybe. And it bites. Hard. What have you got? VALENTINA Rice, butter, carrot jam. ANTON God help us. VALENTINA Ham. ANTON Ah, ham. Give me the ham. Valentina reluctantly gives up the ham sandwich. They eat. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   61. 
JIMMY We checked with Wendi. It doesn't look like Gary is on board. ANTON The duck... is Gary. TILDA How? ANTON Valentina has something she'd like to tell us. VALENTINA I don't know all the facts. ANTON Go on. Please. VALENTINA The time cube sent him here through the duck. It was an accident. JIMMY This is the Gary that Tilda says destroyed Earth. He's a duck? VALENTINA He's on this station. He's part man, part rubber duck, part something else. ANTON And I'm going to kill him. VALENTINA How is that going to help? ANTON He tried to eat my face, Val. VALENTINA He's going through a lot of changes. He's not thinking straight. But he's the only one that set things right if we give him the Time Cube. TILDA He's not here to help us. VALENTINA I suppose you've helped us? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   62. 
ANTON I'm with Tilda on this one for now. VALENTINA You're what? JIMMY Me too. VALENTINA Shut up Jimmy, no one asked you. METAL CREAKING NOISE O.S., sound of cables snapping. ANTON Sorry Val. Plan A: we get control of Gary. We're going to assume he's only going to keep smashing things. Jimmy, Tilda, work on Wendi. If we can get eyes on him and close doors remotely we can trap him- Another SMASHING noise echoes through the frame of the station. Distant creaking metal sounds. ANTON (CONT'D) Val and I will look for the duck. VALENTINA No. ANTON You said yourself he's not thinking straight. I'm definitely not giving him the Time Cube - that's what got us into this mess. JIMMY Do we have any weapons? Anton opens a drawer. He spills out a handful of disposable plastic knives on the table. ANTON Everyone take one. They do. Jimmy bends his. Space Milkshake Prod.

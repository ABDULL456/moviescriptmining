A strong hint of the cockney working class east and London boy whiffing through his speech and manner. The "mate" is tough and to the point but not insulting... 
GEKKO (has to smile) You must be wearing a mask you're laughing so hard behind it Larry. Let's cut the "sir" crap. Correct me if I'm wrong, but when you took CNX Electronics, you laid off 8,000 workers, Jessmon Fruit about 6,000, that airline... 
WILDMAN (cold, deliberate) I could break you, mate, in two pieces over my knees, you know it, I know it, I could buy you six times ever, I could dump the stock just to burn your ass but I happen to want the company and I want your block of shares. I'm announcing a tender offer at 65 tomorrow, and I'm expecting your commitment. 
Bud watching this drama unfold. Gekko is about to blow, controls it. 
GEKKO Showdowns bore me Larry, neither side wins. You can have the company, in fact it's gonna be fun watching you and your giant ego try to make a horserace out of it... (turns to Bud) What do you think is a fair price for our stock Bud? 
Bud in the spotlight. The eyes all shift to him -- his moment. After an initial panic, he's cool as a cucumber -- and ruthless as his mentor. 
BUD The break up value is higher. It's worth 80. 
GEKKO But we don't want to be greedy now, so let's let him have it at $72. 
His eyes to Wildman who looks at him, cold, icy mean. 
WILDMAN You're a two bit pirate and a green-mailer, Gekko, nothing more... not only would you sell your mother to make a deal, you'd send her COD... 
Bud looking sharply as Gekko's eyes flare with hot white anger. 
GEKKO My mail's the same color as yours Larry. Or it was till the Queen started calling you "sir". Now excuse me before I lose my temper... 
He rises and exits. 
WILDMAN 
Gekko stops at the door, a beat. 
GEKKO Considering you brought my mother into it, $71.50. 
WILDMAN Done. You'll hear from my lawyers. 8 a.m. Good night. 
He walks out with the silent lawyer. Past Gekko who watches. "Ta Ta". 
GEKKO (to Bud) He's right. I had to sell. The key to the game is your capital reserves. You don't have enough, you can't pee in the tall weeds with the big dogs. 
BUD (mimicking Gordon now) "All warfare is based on deception..." Sun Tzu says, If your enemy is superior, evade him, if angry, irritate him, if equally matched, fight... if not, split and reevaluate. 
GEKKO You're learning, sport... 
INT. BUD'S APARTMENT - PRE-DAWN 
Exhausted from the drive back, Bud takes off his sweater and tie and collapses onto the bed, closing his eyes. The phone rings. With a start he wakes and answers it. 
BUD Yeah?... 
INTERCUT TO: 
EXT. GEKKO'S BEACH HOUSE - DAWN 
The sky is still dark, the first rays of light coming up over the ocean. Gekko, a lonely figure in a windbreaker, restlessly prowls the edge of the beach, waves crashing around him. He's been up all night and has an exhausted, driven look as he whispers over the wind into the cellular phone... 
GEKKO Money never sleeps pal. When I came in in '69, they traded six hours a day, now the clock don't stop, London's deregulated, the Orient is hungrier than us. Just let the money circle the world, sport, buying and selling, and if you're smart it comes back paying. I just made $800,000 in Hong Kong gold. It's been wired to you -- play with it. You done good, but you gotta keep doing good. I showed you how the game works, now school's out. 
BUD (protests) Mr. Gekko, I'm there for you 110%. 
GEKKO You don't understand. I want to be surprised...astonish me, sport, new info, don't care where or how you get it, just get it... My wife tells me you put a move on Darien. Here's some inside info for you. That Euroflash GQ guy she's going with's got big bucks but he's putting her feet to sleep. Exit visas are imminent. So don't lose your place in line. (gazing at the surf) Oh, jeez, I wish you could see this. The lights coming up over the water. I've never seen a painting that captures the beauty of the ocean at this moment. (suddenly fatigued) ...an old Russian proverb - "a fisherman always sees another fisherman from afar." I like you sport, I ever tell you that... Gordon, call me Gordon from now on. 
BUD (off) ...Gordon. 
GEKKO Yeah, I'm gonna make you rich, Bud Fox. I'm gonna make you rich enough you can afford a girl like Darien. Remember, power is the best aphrodisiac. This is your wake-up call. Go to work. 
He lets the phone drop to his side, staring glazed-eyed at the ocean. 
INT. ROGER BARNES' OFFICE - EARLY EVENING 
A SECRETARY leads Bud into the plush, private office of a cocky young lawyer, ROGER BARNES, about tho same age as Bud, his his feet up on the desk, sleepily waving to Buddy to park his ass... The pictures an his walls and desk indicate a rich family. 
ROGER Fox, Bud D. is this deja vu or has it really been a year. You're not hitting me up for NYU are you? 
BUD Well we're thinking of putting up a statue of you in the subway. I hear you're moving up in the world. An associate already. Not bad. How's Margie?

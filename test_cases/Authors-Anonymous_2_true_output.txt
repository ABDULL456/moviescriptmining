HENRY No. No. Not at all. 
Eudora smiles, glad for the positive reinforcement. 
EUDORA OK. Good. Because, you know, I don't want people to think I'm weird. 
HENRY Of course not. Do you write? 
EUDORA Kinda, sort of. But I'm thinking of joining a writing group. 
Henry bites his tongue.   Eudora nods towards the camera. 
EUDORA (CONT'D) So what's this? Some kind of reality show, or something? 
Henry smiles. The two continue their idle chatter.

John's trailer. COSTUMED CHILDREN knock on the door while holding their trick or treat bags. 
JOHN (V.O.) Real God-fearing Americans live here. Good people. Not those La La pussies. 
John opens the front door. 
CHILDREN Trick or Treat! 
John responds by dropping a BOOK in the first bag. 
JOHN Look at this treat you get. A copy of Roaring Lion by John K. Butzin. Happy Halloween. 
The children are dumbfounded. John moves on to the next child.

William is back at the counter, looking as scruffy as ever. Off to the side stands a GEEKY KID, gripping a FLIP PHONE aimed directly at William. William talks to our camera. 
WILLIAM C'mon. Admit it. You missed me. It wasn't as interesting once I left, right? 
He winks.   The Kid doesn't move. 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) I knew the group wouldn't last without me. No way. Losers. 
He nods towards his companion. 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) Him? Oh. It's my new project. A reality TV show based on my life. You know...women I meet...thoughts that pop into my head. Kid follows me all around. 24/7. Actually I got the idea from you guys. Same concept-- just better characters. 
A question is asked. 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) Which network? Um, well...it's a...it's P-P-A...Pasadena Public Access. Oh, people watch. Yeah. We're on right after that pet psychic. 
A waitress's HAND reaches in and refills William's coffee cup. He likes what he sees. 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) Thanks, babe. 
He looks over to Geeky Kid. 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) Get a close-up on her. Nice and tight. 
William will never change. 
WILLIAM (CONT'D) And, hey, Kid. Lend me five bucks. I want to leave an extra special tip.

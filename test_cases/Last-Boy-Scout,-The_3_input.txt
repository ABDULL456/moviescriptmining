JIMMY Get out of here. Go. She goes. He leans over and grabs Ray by the hair. The guy is bleeding. Delirious. Jimmy yanks until their faces are inches apart. JIMMY Best arm in the National League, you son of a bitch. Remember that. He lets go. Ray sags, semi-conscious. The poker players come running as Jimmy walks back inside. 
EXT. COAST HIGHWAY - DAY Jimmy gets into the car. Takes out his vial. Spoons some powder, sucks it up. A voice in the background: "Hey, someone shit on my car!" 
EXT. SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY Joe Hallenbeck slides his Plymouth to the curb in front of a cozy stucco dwelling. Gets out, crosses the lawn. A fat NEIGHBOR is watering shrubs next door. He waves. NEIGHBOR 'Morning, Joe, how's it going? HALLENBECK My ears are burning, Andy. Even as we speak, someone, somewhere is calling me an asshole. NEIGHBOR You're funny. HALLENBECK I'm playing Tahoe on the 15th. 
INT. HALLENBECK'S HOUSE - SAME TIME Hallenbeck enters and crosses the living room. A woman, forty-ish, once beautiful, appears in the bedroom doorway. Wearing a terry cloth robe. This is Joe's wife SARAH. SARAH I thought you were in Las Vegas. HALLENBECK I was. SARAH Where did you sleep? HALLENBECK Office. He brushes past her and crosses to the bed.   On the pillow, a big stuffed cat toy smiles benignly. HALLENBECK Hey, Furry Tom. He sits on the bed. Lights a cigarette. Opens the night stand and removes a speedloader for his .38. Starts to load the gun. SARAH How much did you lose? HALLENBECK I wasn't there to gamble.    I was doing a skip trace. SARAH How much did you lose? 
HALLENBECK Fifty bucks. He suddenly notices a sheet of paper on the night stand. A crayon sketch. He picks it up, frowns: HALLENBECK What's this? SARAH Darian's class drew holiday pictures. That was hers. Her teacher wants to see us, Joe. 
CLOSE ON DRAWING It's a picture   of Santa Claus,  except this Santa has long, stringy hair,   bloodshot eyes,  and grotesque talons. A little girl's   severed head is  clutched in one hand. Underneath, in   block capitals,  is written: SATAN CLAUS. 
BACK TO SCENE HALLENBECK Satan Claus. Kid's got some talent, don't you think? SARAH It's hideous. 
Her voice is ice cold.    Joe turns and regards her levelly. HALLENBECK You okay, Sarah...? SARAH I'm tense. I couldn't get to sleep last night. HALLENBECK Hmmmm. Well, I think the kid will be fine. Boys still tease her about the headgear? SARAH Are you kidding? Brace Face, that's the latest. Little bastards. HALLENBECK (under his breath) She'll be fucking them by the time she's fourteen. SARAH Watch your Goddamn mouth, Joe. HALLENBECK Well, Christ, you let her wear enough makeup. The kid looks like a goddamn raccoon. She comes in late at night, I think, 'Christ, a burglar.' I almost shot her twice. SARAH You're not funny. All the girls at that school wear makeup. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK Yeah, but they don't apply it with a paint sprayer. And for your information, our neighbors think I'm very funny. SARAH Go live with them. HALLENBECK Don't tempt me. He tosses the holstered .38 on the bed.   Stalks into the bathroom. 
INT. BATHROOM HALLENBECK Damn raccoon. He sighs, tosses his cigarette butt in the toilet. Walks back out into the bedroom. 
INT. BEDROOM He kneels, looks under the bed. Frowns. Straightens and says, very conversationally: HALLENBECK Who's the guy in the closet? Sarah stops dead.   Spins and stares at him. 
SARAH Excuse me? HALLENBECK (frowns) Oh, that's right, you sometimes forget that I'm a detective. (lights a cigarette) See, first I noticed how tense you were, but I let that pass. Then I noticed there was steam in the shower like someone was just in there, but meanwhile your hair is completely dry, you follow? So. Why the steamy shower? (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: HALLENBECK (CONT'D) Because someone else was in there, right, and since he's not under the bed you must have stuck him in the closet when you heard my key in the door a day early. Tah-dah. Please, no applause. A silence hangs between them.    Sarah just stares.   Shakes her head. SARAH Well, nothing changes.    You're still a lunatic.

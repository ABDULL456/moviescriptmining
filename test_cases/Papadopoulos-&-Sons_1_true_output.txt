HARRY Hello. Could I speak to Rob. 
SOPHIE He's not at his desk. Can I take a message? 
HARRY It's Harry Papadopoulos. 
SOPHIE Oh hi. It's Sophie. We met at your office, the other day. 
HARRY Oh hi. Any news? 
SOPHIE We're lining up interest. 
HARRY Right. Well, I just need to know... I need to know if this is going to work. 
SOPHIE Rest assured. We'll be driving the herd to Abilene. 
HARRY Sorry. 
SOPHIE It's an old American, Mid-West expression. (Beat) Are you okay Mr. Papadopoulos? HARRY Yep, all good. Just keep me informed please. 
SOPHIE Of course. 
HARRY hangs up. ROB enters. 
SOPHIE (CONT'D) Harry Papadopoulos called. You should call him back. 
ROB Let's go out, yeah. Let's celebrate. Let's find... I don't know... Let's find a... salsa club or something. 
SOPHIE Sorry?

ROB Daddy just put another pig in da bag. Owch! A new instruction. Wallinghams. Big UK retail chain. Established. (Wallinghams jingle) Leave it... Leave it to Wallinghams... Comfortably, elegantly, reliably. Wallinghams. (Voice-over mode) Croydon, Greenwich, Enfield, Wimbledon and... Ding! Going into administration. Coming to little old moi for services rendered. (Tommy Cooper) Thank you. Oh thank you very much. God I love an economic downturn. Joking aside though. Five thousand laid off. Sad. Very, very sad. But dear sweet mother of God it was a shit business. 
SOPHIE Happy days. 
ROB Oh yeah. Hallelujah! (He goes to exit) Six?

COLIN As if I could. 
MARILYN Everyone else on the picture wishes they could. 
COLIN Everyone else doesn't understand. She smiles, touched. 
MARILYN Be a gentleman and walk me to my car? 
152B EXT. DOG & DUCK PUB. DAY 152B 
The ever faithful Roger stands by the idling car. COLIN opens the car door for MARILYN. MARILYN beckons him closer. She kisses him gently. He smiles and says lightly: 
COLIN What's that for? 
MARILYN That's for being on my side; and remember, when you see me wink, that's for you. ROGER walks around the car and looks over at COLIN. 
ROGER (glancing at COLIN) Looking a couple of inches taller than when I first saw you. ROGER nods at COLIN (a silent salute suggesting job well done.) He gets into the car and we stay on COLIN as he watches it pull away. BARRY comes to the doorway of the pub. 
BARRY Was that really Marilyn Monroe? 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 117B. 
COLIN No - just a good friend of mine. BARRY walks back into the pub, leaving COLIN alone, staring at the vanishing car. And then the sun swallows it as it drives into the English countryside. 
FADE TO: 
153 EXT. WARDOUR STREET. LONDON. DAY. 153 
COLIN walks along chatting to friends. Dressed in a neat dark suit he looks older and more confident. There is little sign left of the callow young man who paced up and down the pavement outside Sir Laurence Olivier's office. We see the caption: SIX YEARS LATER. 
154 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. DAY. 154 
COLIN walks into a small office. Film cans are piled up all over the floor and books and papers spill off the shelves. A SECRETARY sits typing at her desk. COLIN goes to his own desk, glances at his diary, then looks up. 
COLIN Any messages? THE SECRETARY pushes a piece of paper at him. 
SECRETARY It's probably just someone having a joke. COLIN looks down at the message. There is a Los Angeles phone number and then the name - Marilyn Monroe. 
COLIN (After a moment) Did she say anything? 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 118. 
SECRETARY She just asked you to call. (Pause) It is a joke, isn't it? COLIN stares down at the paper. 
COLIN Probably. (Pause) Book a call as soon as you can. Los Angeles, California. Brentwood 1890. 
CUT TO: 
155 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT. 155 
It is late. COLIN stares at the number on the scrap of paper. The phone rings. He picks it up eagerly. 
OPERATOR Your call to Los Angeles. We hear the crackle of the international line. He waits anxiously as the ringing continues. 
CUT TO: 
155A EXT. LOS ANGELES. MARILYN'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. DAY. 
155A ESTABLISH the luxurious exterior of Marilyn's comfortable Brentwood house. 
CUT TO: 
156 INT. LOS ANGELES. MARILYN'S HOUSE. LIVING ROOM. 156 
DAY. The room is large and tasteful - white sofas and cushions and deep rugs. Picture windows look out onto the Hollywood hills. A white phone rings on the table. It rings continuously, insistently. It carries on ringing. No one comes. HOLD on the jangling phone. Each time it rings we think Marilyn might appear, but she never does. It carries on ringing, unanswered, in the empty room. As the picture fades we hear like a ghostly lament the sweet echo of Marilyn's voice singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 119. 
MARILYN 
(VO) "I found a dream and lay in your arms the whole night through, I'm yours no matter what others may say or do. Be light of heart and fancy free, that's the way to start, there will be nothing to lose till you lose your heart..." The fragile voice hangs in the air for a second, then slowly drifts away to nothing. 
157 INT. COLIN'S OFFICE. WARDOUR STREET. NIGHT. 157 
COLIN sits with the phone to his ear. The sound of Marilyn singing the Sleeping Prince Waltz dies away and we realise has been revisiting it in his memory. He waits as long as he can but it is obvious no one is going to answer. In the end he puts the receiver back in its cradle in resignation. His gaze drifts up to a shelf stacked with film cans. He stands up and looks through them, blowing dust away; they have been here for a long time, ignored. He finds the one he is looking for - it says simply MM on the can. He takes the short reel of film and threads it through a Movieola in the corner of the room. He turns it on and bends to look. The screen bursts into life with an image of MARILYN at her most vital and captivating. It is a copy of some rushes from The Prince And The Showgirl, perhaps given to Colin by Olivier, or perhaps "borrowed" as a souvenir and long since forgotten. We see MARILYN dancing happily, exaggerating off camera, looking playful and sexy. She is radiant and full of life. After a moment she turns and looks off camera - perhaps to where Colin himself would have been standing - and winks happily. Blown up to the full size of the screen it is utterly sweet and charming. There is something so completely natural about the gesture COLIN feels he has been swept back seven years in time and MARILYN is standing in front of him again, in the flesh. It moves and delights him; perhaps he has never even really seen this clip before. At any rate he hasn't thought about it for years. It is MARILYN as he will always remember her, relaxed, affectionate and vital, a part of her, however tiny, forever his. She smiles, laughs at something, giggles in delight (without sound). She says something to an unseen crew member, then looks back, smiling at the camera. 
MY WEEK WITH MARILYN 120. 
Her face fills the screen. Beautiful, timeless - Happy. HOLD on the image for as long as we dare, then - 
FADE TO BLACK.

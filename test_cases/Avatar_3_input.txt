He points to his scarred face. 
QUARITCH They could fix this if I rotated back. But you know what? I kinda like it. Reminds me every day what's out there. Besides, I can't leave -- 
He looks out, as if he can see through the wall to the tree- line. 
QUARITCH This is my war, here. 
Quaritch climbs the `suit and reaches into the cockpit, throwing some switches. The `suit's gas-turbine spools up with a rising WHINE. 
QUARITCH The avatar program is a joke -- buncha limpdick scientists. But we have a unique opportunity here, you and I. A recon Marine in an avatar body could get me the intel I need, on the ground, right in the hostiles' camp. 
The WHINE is now a roaring WHOOSH as the `suit trembles with power. The air boils above the exhaust vents. 
Quaritch reaches in and operates the controls, flexing one huge hand. He nods to the waiting mechanic -- 
QUARITCH Looks good. (to Jake) I need you to learn about these savages, gain their trust. Find out how I can force their cooperation, or hit `em hard if they don't. Maybe you can keep some of my boys from going home like you. Or bagged-and-tagged. 
JAKE (NODDING) That sounds real good, Colonel.   So -- am I still with Augustine? 
QUARITCH On paper. You walk like one of her science pukes, you quack like one, but you report to me. Can you do that for me? 
Jake nods. Quaritch brings the `suit to life. He steps forward and pivots smoothly. 
He balances the two ton machine on one foot while sweeping the arms in strong, graceful arcs. Jake realizes he is doing a WU-SHOO KATA. A flawless display of strength and control. He's impressive, and Jake is impressed. Quaritch is the kind of man he respects -- focused, hard. Determined. 
QUARITCH Look, son -- I take care of my own. Get me what I need, I'll see you get your legs back when you rotate home. Your real legs. 
He raises the `suit's hand, and slams the canopy shut like the visor of a helmet. Jake watches Quaritch walk past, huge feet CLANGING -- KUNG! KUNG! KUNG! 
INT. BIO LAB - DAY 
GRACE is on the move, gulping coffee, in a hurry to get their FIRST SORTIE started. She hands a clipboard to MAX. 
GRACE Start calibrating. We're on the flight line in ten minutes. 
Max nods and jogs ahead toward the LINK ROOM. JAKE and NORM fall in with Grace as they enter the CONNECTING CORRIDOR. 
GRACE What did Atilla want? 
JAKE Just Marines comparin' tattoos. 
GRACE (not buying it) Yeah. Well, listen to me, Marine -- 
She stops, turning to drill him with a look. 
GRACE -- you're driving an avatar, now.     That means you're in my world, got it? 
JAKE Got it. 
She turns and enters the LINK ROOM. 
INT. LINK ROOM 
Grace crosses to the controls of Jake's LINK UNIT. As the others catch up -- 
GRACE That son of a bitch has screwed up this program enough. All this -- (indicating link room) -- exists so we can go out there and build a bridge of trust to these people, who could teach us so much. But thanks to Quaritch and his thugs the Na'vi won't even talk to us anymore. 
JAKE Then how's this supposed to work? 
GRACE We have a new face. (turning to Norm) You're fluent, you've studied the culture. You're non-threatening. The ones we know best -- the Omaticaya clan -- may give you a chance. Maybe you can get them back to the table before things go tits-up for good. 
NORM This is failing as a pep talk. 
Jake hauls himself across from wheelchair to link. 
JAKE How do we contact them? 
GRACE We don't. They contact us. If they see us taking our samples, treating the forest with respect -- (pointedly to Jake) Not trampling everything in sight -- they may reach out to us. 
JAKE Or they may skin us and make a drum. 
Jake lies back, lowering the sensor array over his body. 
GRACE Just keep your mouth shut and let Norm do the talking. 
She closes his clamshell, HARD, and we -- CUT TO: 
EXT. RAIN FOREST / AERIAL - DAY 
FLYING over a carpet of rainforest, past sheer cliffs and cloud-wreathed mesas. TRUDY'S SAMSON TILT-ROTOR chases its shadow across the treetops. Though big as a Blackhawk, it is tiny in the vast primeval landscape. 
ANGLE THROUGH the open side doors of the Samson. Trooper WAINFLEET, in exo-mask and body armor, leans on his door gun, scanning for aerial predators. 
In avatar form JAKE, GRACE and NORM watch the forest unrolling beneath them, the wind blasting their clothes. Jake mans the other door gun, his feet propped on the skids. 
TRUDY flies from a pressurized cockpit. She banks to follow a shallow river. 
TRUDY (INTERCOM) Sturmbeest herd, one o'clock. 
Norm grins and points, excitedly. Jake looks in time to see-- A herd of STURMBEEST -- massive six-legged creatures reminiscent of buffalo -- thundering across the river. 
GRACE Looks like a bull, six cows and some juveniles. 
NORM The bull has the red on the dorsal armor? 
Grace nods approvingly. 
TIME CUT -- Hundreds of purple winged creatures take flight from a lake, startled by the Samson. They skim the water above their own reflections. TETRAPTERONS. 
TIME CUT -- the ground drops away as the Samson flies over a WATERFALL hundreds of feet high. Trudy banks hard, rolling in on the gorge below like it's a gun-run. 
Wainfleet WHOOPS while Norm looks like he's about to puke. 
WAINFLEET Yo Chacon!     Get some! 
Jake grins into the airstream. CUT TO: 
EXT. CLEARING - DAY 
A small meadow among towering trees. The fern-like "grass" is beaten down in waves by the rotor-wash as the Samson settles to the ground. 
Jake pulls the massive door gun off its pintle mount and hefts it like an assault rifle. 
He and Wainfleet leap out to secure the LZ, scanning the tree- line warily, weapons aimed.

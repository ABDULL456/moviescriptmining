DOORMAN Officer... officer... 
Kenji stops.   Beside him is Yasujiro. 
DOORMAN (CONT'D) This is the man you were looking for. 
Kenji approaches him while the doorman discretely moves away to leave them alone in the lobby. 
KENJI Good evening, I'm lieutenant Mamiya. 
YASUJIRO Good evening, how can I help you? 
KENJI Sir, there was an incident and... 
Yasujiro looks at him attentively. Kenji, still moved by Chieko, looks distracted, confused. 
KENJI (CONT'D) I don't mean to bother you, but... (a beat) Do you own a .270 caliber Winchester 70 rifle with the registration number... 
Kenji looks through his pockets, takes out a small notebook and looks up the missing number. 
KENJI (CONT'D) UK-9023? 
YASUJIRO I don't remember the license, but I did have a rifle like the one you described. 
KENJI Is it true that you gave it to a Mr. Hassan Ibrahim, who lives in southern Morocco? 
YASUJIRO Hassan Ibrahim? 
KENJI He says he was your guide in a hunt. 
YASUJIRO Hassan? Of course. He was a very good guide and I gave him the rifle. Hassan is a very kind man. Did anything happen? 
KENJI There was an attempted murder with that rifle, and the Moroccan police want to confirm it's not off the black market. 
YASUJIRO No, I gave it to him. (a beat) Is Hassan ok? 
KENJI I don't know. 
Yasujiro remains silent for a moment. 
YASUJIRO Am I legally involved? 
KENJI Not for the moment. You may have to go testify for your friend. 
YASUJIRO Can I leave now? 
KENJI Good night. 
They both bow to say goodbye. Yasujiro walks toward the elevator. Kenji calls out to him. 
KENJI (CONT'D) Excuse me. 
Kenji approaches and Yasujiro awaits, expectant. 
KENJI (CONT'D) Your daughter told me about your wife on the balcony. I'm very sorry. 
YASUJIRO What balcony? 
KENJI About how your wife killed herself by jumping off the balcony. 
YASUJIRO My wife never jumped off a balcony. She shot herself in the head. My daughter was the first to find her. 
Kenji is left speechless. 
YASUJIRO (CONT'D) I've explained it to the police several times. Don't bother us with that anymore, please. 
KENJI I'm very sorry sir, we won't bother you anymore. Good night. 
He turns around and leaves the building. 
198   EXT. TOKYO STREETS -- NIGHT 
Kenji walks down the streets immersed in his thoughts. 
199   INT. BAR -- NIGHT 
Kenji sits in a half-empty bar.   He turns to the bartender. 
KENJI Another whisky. 
The T.V. has been turned on to a Japanese newscast. Kenji takes out Chieko's note, reads it and, as soon as he is done, closes his eyes. He looks around. Everybody seems to be immersed in a world far from his own. 
A reporter appears on T.V. 
REPORTER Susan Jones, the American woman wounded in an attack in Morocco ten days ago, left the hospital today, heading to the United States... 
Susan appears on screen in a wheelchair pushed by a male nurse and followed by Richard. 
The bartender leans over to Kenji. 
BARTENDER Do you want something to eat?    I could make you a sandwich. 
KENJI No thank you. 
When he looks back at the news, the story has changed.   Kenji drinks his whisky parsimoniously. 
200   INT. ELEVATOR, CHIEKO'S BUILDING -- NIGHT 
Yasujiro rides the elevator up, lost in thought. 
201   EXT. BALCONY, CHIEKO'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT 
From the balcony, naked, Chieko observes the city stretching before her. 
Yasujiro walks in and encounters his daughter completely naked. There are still traces of Chieko's tears in her eyes.

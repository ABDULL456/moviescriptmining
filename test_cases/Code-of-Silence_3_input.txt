EDDIE (V.O.) Just watch, kid. Learn. 
Diana leaves the children with the zoo lecturer. 
DIANA Be back in a minute. 
She crosses to the two goons and looks up at Gamiani. 
DIANA What do you want? 
LOU Your Papa worries about you. 
DIANA Get out of here, Lou. Leave me alone. 
Gamiani shrugs, his pal Tito seems embarrassed, but they don't move. 
INT. GORILLA HOUSE - DAY 
The CHILDREN SCREAM, and LULU, the half-ton baboon flies into frame, swinging down from the artificial branches of an iron tree in the three story central cage. The children clutch at Diana in delightful terror. The gorilla, inches away, kisses the thick glass that separates them. 
Lulu swings to the upper branches and sits, arms crossed, staring eyeball-to-eyeball at her human counterpart, Gamiani. Tito eats popcorn. 
Eddie and Kosalas walk behind a mother and child, each holding a balloon. 
EXT. LIBRARY - DAY 
Diana is on the front steps of the library saying good-bye to two of the children from the zoo. She hands them over to their mothers, and goes up the steps into the building. 
Gamiani and Tito pull over and park down the street. 
Eddie comes around the corner, and follows her in. 
INT. LIBRARY HALL - DAY 
The sign on the door tells us this is the city's Special Education Program office. Diana enters the office and confers briefly with another staff member. 
INT. LIBRARY HALL - DAY 
Through the open door of the Special Education Program office, Eddie observes Diana chatting with her co-workers. 
INT. READING ROOM - DAY 
Eddie follows as Diana walks through the great hall past long tables and out the other door. 
EXT. LIBRARY - DAY 
Diana comes down the steps, wading through the swarm of homebound commuters, and catches a cab. 
And head and shoulders above the crowd, scanning the tops of heads, is Lou Gamiani. 
Tito comes around the corner in his car, and pulls up to the curb. Gamiani jumps in, and they take off after Diana's cab. 
Eddie and Kosalas follow in Eddie's car. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Diana enters an apartment building. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
By the time Diana exits it is dark. She is with a friend, and both are in some kind of Halloween costume. They catch a cab. 
EXT. PARTY STREET - NIGHT 
The taxi stops in front of an ancient brick loft building. Diana and her friend get out and hit the buzzer at an unmarked door. The door opens and they disappears inside. 
Gamiani's car cruises past. It pulls up at the corner and it's lights switch off.

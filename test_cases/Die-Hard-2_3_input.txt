TRUDEAU(CONT'D) Our NAV and Approach systems are down and we expect to lose voice in another minute. We want you to continue holding at the outer marker as directed and wait for further instructions. As - as soon as we're back on line we'll expedite your landings on a.fuel emergency basis. Good luck... 
(PAUSE) God bless. He turns to a tech, face ashen. 
TRUDEAU Okay. Change the boards.

101 INT. DULLES - MAIN TERMINAL - NIGHT 101 
ANGLE ON a bank of ARRIVAL MONITORS. Already a quarter of the planes are DELAYED by weather; but now, in a domino like PATTERN, all the remaining FLIGHT DATA changes to DELAYED. CAMERA ADJUSTS to show PEOPLE REACTING with frustration and concern. 
CUT TO: 
102 INT. DULLES BASEMENT 102 
Pretty dark and creepy for a place only 25 years old. A FLASHLIGHT BEAM PANS THE LENS. We SEE the two lobby guards as they search the basement. They move AWAY from the CAMERA. Pause. 
CONTINUED 
(X) 
102 CONTINUED - 102 McClane APPEARS in the gloom close to CAMERA, clothes now a little greasy and dirty from his little escape. 
MCCLANE (sotto, to himself) I don't believe this... another fucking elevator... another fucking basement... why does this always happen to me? He moves through the cavernous maze, and then REACTS to MUSIC. Moves towards it. And arrives in - 
103 AN ... APARTMENT 103 Or something like it: Here, in an area reached only my somebody with a groundhog in his ancestry, is a space with some battered chairs, a 3-legged card table, a cot made up with faded but neat covers, some 50's vintage.(but lovingly scotch taped) PIN UPS, and a tiny kitchen precariously propped up on a big purple plumbling valve on the wall. 
104 ON A PHONOGRAPH 104 The SOURCE of.the music, a 78 SPINNING on the old machine. McClane's HAND picks it up and we WIDEN as he looks at it curiously. A HAND reaches for McClane's shoulder. 
105 NEW ANGLE 105 McClane's instincts take over; in a flash, he WHIRLS and his would be attacker is pinned against a wall. It's a wizened MAN in his 60's who now raises his hands to show he ain't looking for trouble. 
MCCLANE Who the fuck are you? In response, the man points to the NAMETAG on his coveralls. 
MAN (MARVIN) Marvin, I'm Marvin. Thought you was tryin' to steal my records, that's all. He moves to them, possessively. 
MARVIN(CONT'D) They're valuble, you know. Me, I like those old 78's. Won't find me switching like everybody else to these new fangled 45's. 
CONTINUED 
(X) 
105 CONTINUED - 105 McClane reacts to that, peers at him. 
MCCLANE You're what, the janitor? 
MARVIN Damn straight. Janitor, and proud of it. Don't need any of this new fangled custodial engineer crap. Just do my job and screw the fancy talk. You know, you're not supposed to be down here. 
MCCLANE 
(LOOKING AROUND) Yeah. Just like you're not supposed to be living here. 
MARVIN W-who said I was living here? McClane shows his badge. 
MCCLANE Come on, Marvin. I wasn't born yesterday. Carmine Lorenzo know you don't go home after you punch out? 
MARVIN L-Lorenzo? C-come on, officer, I can barely get by, even with my pension. You know, I'm a vet, WW 2? If it wasn't for guys like me, you kids' be eatin' sushi today. I'm just trying to. save a few. bucks -I could. get fired if you tell. McClane moves over to a big panel with telephone lines and jacks. Examines it as he speaks. 
MCCLANE I'm a veteran myself, Marvin. And a married one. You married? 
MARVIN Six times. 
MCCLANE My wife may be in some trouble upstairs. I gotta find out. This set up of yours? I won't tell a soul... provided you patch me into this panel, 'let me eavesdrop on the tower. What do you say? 
CONTINUED. 
(X) 
105 CONTINUED - (2) 105 
MARVIN You a cop or a lawyer? 
CUT TO: 
106 INT. AIRPORT POLICE OFFICE - NIGHT 106 
There hasn't been this much activity here since Gorbachov dropped in. FIVE SWAT OFFICERS check gear, leave the office at Lorenzo's signal - 
LORENZO 
(INTO PHONE) I'm sending the SWAT team over for Barnes now - we don't need the Goddamn Christmas tourists seeing guns and flipping out so they'll take him the long way around... 
107 IN BASEMENT - TIGHT ON ALLIGATOR CLIPS 107 We WIDEN as Marvin connects them to one set of bolts, then another. 'McClave shakes his head. No... no...yes! 
LORENZO'S VOICE Through the annex skywalk to the new terminal... that way nobody sees them, we don't have any panic. 
TRUDEAU'S VOICE And we don't want any disasters. Barnes has five minutes to check out that antenna array.

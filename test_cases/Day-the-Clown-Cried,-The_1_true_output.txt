It is perhaps two hours later.   Sergeant Hoffman is now leaning wearily against the boxcar near the door.  The CAMERA PANS over to the staff car, where Scharff is dozing in the back seat. 
MED. SHOT - SERGEANT HOFFMAN 
From within the boxcar we can HEAR Helmut SINGING softly to the children.  Sergeant Hoffman is listening.  Finally he takes something from his pocket, goes to the door of the boxcar and sticks his head inside. 
INT BOXCAR 
The children are scattered about, either sleeping or near sleep, many of them cuddled close to Helmut, who sits near the door with his back against the side of the car, crooning. 
SERGEANT HOFFMAN (whispering) Clown.  Clown, can you play one of these? 
He holds out a harmonica.  Helmut leans over to get it, being careful not to disturb the children. 
SERGEANT HOFFMAN I got it to send home to my boy... but if it'll help... 
TWO SHOT - HELMUT, HOFFMAN 
HELMUT It will.  It will. (he takes it) 
SERGEANT HOFFMAN You won't say anything to the Lieutenant. 
HELMUT I promise. 
He leans back and looks at the harmonica, then he has a sudden thought as Hoffman's head disappears.  He leans back toward the door. 
HELMUT Guard... guard. 
Hoffman reappears at door. 
HELMUT It's going to be dark soon.  The little ones may be afraid.  Do you think... well... could you get some kind of a light for in here? 
SERGEANT HOFFMAN (angry) Want to get me in trouble? 
Helmut nods that he understands Hoffman's situation. 
SERGEANT HOFFMAN (trying to justify himself) I would if I could. 
HELMUT I know.  I know you would. 
Again Hoffman's face disappears.  Helmut leans back and begins experimenting with the harmonica.  Actually he can play it only slightly, but he manages to get some sort of soft tune out of it.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY to include the children, most of who are resting peacefully, secure in Helmut's presence.  But suddenly a little dark haired, dark- eyed girl of about six, sits upright and cries out, frightened by a bad dream.  Helmut reacts.  The child looks around the boxcar as if she can't remember how she got there and begins crying inconsolably.  Some of the other children stir.  Helmut quickly but carefully disengages himself from the tots around him and picks his way over to the girl.  He kneels beside her, and the CAMERA MOVES UP to -- 
TIGHT TWO SHOT - HELMUT, DARK-EYED GIRL 
The child continues crying, but more softly, he wide wet eyes on Helmut. 
HELMUT (gently) What's the matter? (she only stares at him) It's all right -- just a bad dream. 
He tries to put a comforting arm around her, but she shrinks away continuing to sob softly.  Realizing that words won't help, he turns to the harmonica for communication, serenading her with a soft but sprightly tune of his own improvisation. It is hardly a masterpiece, but it has the desired effect. The girl stops sobbing, and when Helmut finishes the tune he makes a real funny face and she timorously puts a hand up to touch his make-up, but pulls it back quickly.  With an affectionate smile, Helmut takes her hand and runs it over his face, pretending that her touch tickles him.  As he laughs, the child begins to smile faintly.  He shows her the traces of chalk make-up on her fingers, and she giggles. His conquest is all but complete.  He picks the youngster up, and holding her like a dancing partner, pretends to dance with her to a little tune he hums.  She loves this and laughs outright.  When Helmut finally puts her down, he kisses her on the cheek and turns his cheek in an unspoken request for a return kiss.  The girl shyly and quickly gives Helmut's cheek a peck.  Grinning, Helmut pats the spot where she kissed him to show his appreciation for her wonderful gift. 
WIDER ANGLE 
The older girl we saw earlier calls to him in a hushed voice. 
OLDER GIRL Doork. 
Helmut moves over and squats down beside her and the CAMERA MOVES IN to -- 
CLOSE TWO SHOT - HELMUT, OLDER GIRL 
OLDER GIRL Where are they sending us? 
HELMUT (shaking his head) Don't know. 
OLDER GIRL Do you have children? 
Helmut looks around at the children.  He smiles sadly. 
HELMUT I do now. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. STAFF CAR - NEAR DUSK 
Scharff, dozing in the back seat, is awakened by the SOUND of an approaching train o.s.  He listens, glances at his watch, shakes his head and gets out of the car. 
EXT. RAILROAD SIDING - NEAR DUSK 
As Scharff strides to the boxcar, where Sergeant Hoffman has also hear the locomotive.  He salutes as Scharff comes up, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him. 
SCHARFF It finally got here. 
SERGEANT HOFFMAN Yes, sir. 
SCHARFF Help them get the car coupled on. 
We want to move it out of here as fast as possible.  Be sure the doors are locked.  And, get the clown off. 
Hoffman salutes, and Scharff moves off toward the approaching locomotive and freight cars being backed up to the boxcar.

GILLANDERS Compressed air horn, most likely. Hope to God some man hears you in that fog. 
NELS All right, what if the defendant heard?  So Carl let him aboard, to help.  And then the fishing gaff? 
Gillanders grins.  Wide. 
GILLANDERS You mean Miyamoto followed him out there, and sucker-punched him? 
NELS Well, what if? 
GILLANDERS Now, how is Miyamoto gonna know in advance?  That Carl loses two batteries.  Must happen once ever' 20 years or so. 
Another chuckle or two from the gallery. 
NELS Thank you, Mr. Gillanders.  Thank you for coming down, in this cold weather. 
GILLANDERS Well, it does seem mighty warm in here.  Specially for Mr. Hooks. 
And looks at the prosecutor.  Who rises, easily.  A most polite fuck-you smile.  Hooks strolls now.  Slow and steady.  Straight to the witness box.  Rests his hands on the rail.  Leans in. 
HOOKS What if the defendant follows Carl. And pretends his own batteries are dead?  Would Carl tie up and help? 
And the smile on Gillander's face.  Stops.  Cold. 
HOOKS Is the word you're groping for...'yes', perha... 
JUDGE (O.S.) Alvin! 
HOOKS Rephrase.  Do you agree that he might tie up to the defendant's bo... 
GILLANDERS So why's the D-6 in Carl's well? 
HOOKS Who's to say?  Maybe it was just a spare, after all.  Or maybe the defendant left it, as a potential alibi.  In case somebody saw him in Ship Channel Bank. (beat) In case we put two and two together, knowing of the hostility. Between the families. 
Gillanders.  Actually thinking about that. 
HOOKS My question is.  Could Carl have tied up to help the defendant? 
A beat.  A cleared throat. 
GILLANDERS It coulda happened.  And if I start to say it's doubtful, you'd probl'y say 'no further questions', right? 
Once more, laughter.  Enough to bring the gavel DOWN. 
HOOKS Right about that.  And right that it 'coulda happened'. 
Turns his back, walks away. 
HOOKS Thanks for your help.  Hope the witness box wasn't too warm for your comfort. 
All eyes follow the prosecutor, as he sits.  Except for the defendant.  His stare forward.  Recalling... 
INT. KABUO'S CELL - NIGHT 
Kabuo seated on the concrete floor of his cell, leaning back against the wall.  Leaving the cot.  For his guest. 
NELS But the toughest scenario.  Is the one Hooks will never raise. 
Kabuo watching.  Quiet.  Takes a breath... 
KABUO And what's that? 
NELS That you came upon Carl by accident. Like you said.  Gave him the battery. Like you said.  Asked him about the seven acres.  Like you said. 
The hardest.  Straightest.  Look. 
NELS Only.  He said no. 
Silence. 
NELS And something...happened.  That you'd never planned.  Because you're not a cold-blooded killer. 
Nobody flinches.  Nobody blinks. 
KABUO I'm more a hot-blooded killer, huh? Like a soldier.  Like a samurai. 
NELS You won't hear that from Hooks. Because the charge is first-degree murder, which requires premeditation. He can't change the charge. 
Do you understand? 
NELS So if the jury thinks you did kill. but only in the heat of anger.  They have to acquit. 
Do you? 
NELS And you couldn't.  Be.  Re-tried. 
Kabuo's face is stone.  A warrior's mask. 
KABUO You want me to say that. 
NELS I want you.  To tell the truth. 
There is no kindly smile tonight.  No candy bars. 
KABUO You think that is the truth. 
NELS I told your wife.  Trials aren't always so much about actual truth. As about what folks believe is true. That's sad.  And it's real. 
KABUO And what do you believe? 
Nels sighs.  Cocks his head just to one side. 
NELS A question first.  Why do you want to know? 
KABUO (straight back) Because you're my friend. 
The old man thinks about that.  Studies his client. 
NELS I believe you are a good man.  Who belongs with his family. 
And then the feeling comes.  To the watery eyes. 
NELS And I believe.  You didn't do it.

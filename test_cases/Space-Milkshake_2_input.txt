INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Val and Anton sit at the controls as the room shakes. Evil metal creaking noises tear through. Alarms sound. More screens turn to static and garbled. VALENTINA Anton? ANTON Something is definitely wrong. Check the air pressure. VALENTINA Anton! ANTON What? VALENTINA Okay. I haven't been totally honest. ANTON Oh? The rubber duck (duck 2) scuttles across the floor behind them but Anton doesn't see it. Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   56. 
VALENTINA Gary is onboard. ANTON Where is the bastard? How the hell did he get on the station? VALENTINA You brought him in. ANTON When did I do that? Valentina notices that Gary (Duck 2) is in front of Anton, hiding on a shelf, dripping slime. VALENTINA He's just come for the time cube. That's all he needs to get back to his dimension and put things right. Its eyes glow faintly red. ANTON Sure. Naturally. He just wants his time cube. He's not interested in you? VALENTINA He's the only one that can send us home and set things right. Anton follows her gaze and sees the duck there. ANTON What the hell is that? Anton moves around and slowly approaches it. He takes out his laser blaster and charges it. The Duck cowers and backs deeper into the corner of the shelf. ANTON (CONT'D) Anton, you're scaring him. ANTON (CONT'D) Him? Hello little guy. Don't be afraid. We mean you no harm. Hey there. Val what the hell is this thing? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   57. 
He gets ready to fire. VALENTINA That's Gary. Anton slowly moves closer to it. ANTON What? This thing? Anton points his laser. Gary trembles with fear. VALENTINA No! Anton pulls the trigger. It goes click click. ANTON That's odd. The batteries must be- Gary LEAPS at Anton's head. They crash through the room as it attacks him. Papers fly from binders thrown around. Anton screams. The laser pistol is knocked to the floor, broken. Blood splatters against a console, and across Valentina's face. Val screams, staring at the off-screen attack. Anton is thrown down, he turns around and tries to see where the duck is. He's scratched up. It scuttles away down the hall behind him, out of his sight. ANTON (CONT'D) Where did that little bastard go?

INT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT Valentina pulls a first-aid kit off the wall and opens it. Anton has a trivial cut on his head. ANTON It sure is strong for a little guy. VALENTINA I told you to be careful. ANTON Why didn't you just tell me about him? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -   11/12/11   58. 
VALENTINA I tried to tell you. Valentina cleans his cut. She digs through the kit for tape. VALENTINA (CONT'D) How is your head? ANTON It hurts. Valentina sticks a band-aid on Anton. ANTON (CONT'D) Did you know what this thing was when we brought it on board? VALENTINA No, of course not. ANTON Look what he did. VALENTINA He was frightened. ANTON Whose side are you on? A noise down the hall. Anton pulls the handlebar off the elliptical exercise machine and holds it like a club as he goes to one side of the room next to the hall. ANTON (CONT'D) Can you see it? VALENTINA No. Anton peeks down the hall quickly. He reaches to draw his laser blaster - his holster is empty. ANTON Something is coming. Stay back. Space Milkshake Prod.

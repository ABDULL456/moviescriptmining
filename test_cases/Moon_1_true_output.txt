Sam 1 nods at this. He's broken-hearted.   He begins to leave. 
GERTY (CONT'D) Sam, it's been several hours since your last meal. Can I prepare you something? 
SAM 1 No thanks, Gerty. 
Sam 1 exits. 
CUT TO: 
101   INT. SLEEPING QUARTERS                                        101 
Sam 1 enters the sleeping quarters -- straightens the bed and lies down. He picks up the picture of the pregnant TESS, stares at it long and hard. 
CUT TO: 
102   INT. REC ROOM   -- LATER                                      102 
The TV is off. Sam 2 is sitting, arms folded, entrenched in GLOOM. 
Sam 1 enters and heads for the kitchen, prepares himself a snack. Sam 2 is aware that Sam 1 is there, but keeps his eyes focussed forward, as immobile as a statue. 
Eventually Sam 1 tentatively comes over. 
SAM 1 You okay? 
SAM 2 I'm staring into space. (points to the window) Get it? 
Sam 1 does get it. He smiles to be polite, sits. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) How's the nose? 
SAM 1 Better. 
A beat. 
SAM 2 Listen, I went haywire before. I lost it. I'm sorry. 
SAM 1 It's okay. 
SAM 2 No it's not okay. I fucked up Fairfield -- your model -- that's unacceptable. I don't know what's wrong with me. (then) I've got a temper. I need to do something about it. 
SAM 1 Yes you do. 
A pause. 
SAM 2 I've been thinking. That Rescue Unit -- Eliza -- they'll be here in less than fourteen hours. I don't know about you but I'd like to figure out where we stand before they get here. 
SAM 1 Absolutely. 
SAM 2 Ostensibly they're coming to deal with the stalled harvester. We both know that isn't true. (then) They're coming to dig your body out of that rover. They think you're in there. 
SAM 1 Right. 
SAM 2 What'll their reaction be when they find out you survived the crash? I wasn't supposed to find you. Lunar instructed Gerty to lock me inside the base for Christ's sake. 
A pause. Sam 1 thinking it over. 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) And there's something else. Something I haven't told you. (a beat) (MORE) 
SAM 2 (CONT'D) Right around the time I was awakened...I walked in on Gerty talking to Central. He was having a live conversation. 
SAM 1 A live conversation? 
SAM 2 Yeah. 
SAM 1 That's not possible. 
SAM 2 No no no, it is possible. It's possible because I saw it, that's my point. 
Sam 2 feels himself losing his temper a little here. He reigns himself in.

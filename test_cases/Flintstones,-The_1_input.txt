Dodging Pyrite's renewed attack. Now, Barney becomes aware of the activated assembly line. Getting an idea, he moves behind an inspection table, grabs a big rubber stamp. Pyrite comes around the    corner... Barney's head butts him in the gut, dodges under    his legs! Then, as Pyrite stumbles, Barney stamps    his ass with the word "REJECT." Pyrite looks back, sees    this, reddens... raises his club. PYRITE Reject, huh? Whaddya say we reject your head? He raises the club... when an alligator swings down and grabs him by the seat of his pants! Pyrite drops the club, howls -- 159   WIDER                                                        159 The alligator crane swings him away and over a big bin marked REJECTS -- and drops him. Howling, Pyrite falls into a big bin of broken and defective Fibrerock goods. 
160   BARNEY                                                       160 Chuckles to himself... and then looks down, reacts. CAMERA ADJUSTS and we see that Piltdown has smashed yet another of the duplicate Freds. Worried, Barney looks around, sees that he's just above the Fibrefoam chute. Without another thought, he jumps into it -- slides downward like a passenger on the Magerock Mountain Log Flume ride -- 
161   BELOW                                                        161 
Piltdown is about to swing at the real Fred -- when Barney sails out of the end of the chute and slams into him and Fred! All three of them roll across the floor towards -- 
162   THE END OF THE BUILDING                                        162 where a squad of policemen has just appeared -- led by a dripping wet Feldspar and Gravel! 
FELDSPAR All right!   You're all under arr -- 
Wham! Barney, Fred and Piltdown roll right into the cops, who go flying like (what else?) tenpins, complete with appropriate sound. BARNEY (sitting up) Whattya know. Even got the spare again... 
Then he gasps as he looks over at Fred, whose head has just fallen off! Pause. Fred's real head slowly pokes up out of the clay and Fibre shoulders. Before he can extricate himself further, Feldspar and his men are dragging them out of the building. CUT TO: 163   INT. BEDROCK POLICE STATION - NIGHT                            163 Wooden bars delineate the holding cells. "Wanted" posters of stone are hanging on the walls. As we watch, the contrite buffalos are bailed out by friends and relations. Wilma and Betty are just now clunking down stone money on the night sergeant's desk. 
BETTY Barney, I don't understand... what came over you boys? 
EXITING BUFFALO 'Night, Barney. (to Fred) So long, fatso. BUFFALO #2 See ya, Barn. (pause) Flintstone, you're dead meat. BUFFALO #2 'Night, pal.    'Night, slimeball. 
WILMA Fred, is there something you want to tell me about the lodge meeting? 
(CONTINUED) 
163   CONTINUED:                                                    163 FRED I don't wanna talk about it. Besides, who cares about a bunch of jerks running around with furs on their heads? I'm more of a country club guy myself anyway... 
He goes out, hardly looking at Barney. Wilma and Betty look at each other, mystified... then Wilma follows Fred out, puzzled. 
164   EXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT                                   164 Lava stands in the shadows beside his Porscherock. Piltdown and Pyrite are with him. In the b.g., Fred and Wilma drive away. 
LAVA A simple little heist -- I gave you everything but the keys and you blew it -- PILTDOWN Hey, we got the union guys to break in and create a distraction, didn't we? Who knew Flintstone and Rubble would show up, too? LAVA The day after Slate City opens there's going to be an audit. If the stuff isn't gone by then we'll all be doing time until the Bronze Age. PYRITE Don't worry, Mister Lava... we're on top of it. They both turn and start down an alley... jamming together as they do. Lava sighs... then jumps as Barney comes up behind him and taps him on the shoulder. BARNEY Excuse me, Mister Lava -- ? I think you oughta know... something could be wrong with the Fibrerock mix. LAVA (thrown) How do you know that? (recovering) I mean... ah, why do you say that? 
(CONTINUED) 
164   CONTINUED:                                                   164 BARNEY It tastes different. 
LAVA Tastes... different? 
BARNEY Yup. See, ever since I started with Fibrerock -- I mean, since me and Fred started with it, I always take a little taste of the Fibre foam. And tonight's batch, well... I didn't get much of it, but it seems a little off. (smacking his lips) Can't fool the old taste buds, heh-heh. I think there might be an ingredient missing. So tomorrow, I'll run a couple of tests and stuff -- LAVA Rubble, Rubble! We're fighting a deadline to finish Slate City... and we're not pulling the plug on production to satisfy your tastebuds! If you ask me, you and your tastebuds are overworked ... overwrought... how long have you been with us, anyway? BARNEY Nine days, Mister Lava.

KATE Okay, thank you. 
Later.  Plague phones Dade. Plague has Lauren Murphy's records on his screen. 
PLAGUE The girl. The girl has the disc I need. 
DADE I told you, I don't play well with others. 
PLAGUE Turn on your laptop. Set it to receive a file. 
Dade does. 
An extensive criminal record with a strange woman's picture comes up. The strange woman transforms into Dade's mother. 
PLAGUE Lauren Murphy is now a wanted felon in the state of Washington. Forgery, Embezzlement, two drug convictions, plus she jumped parole. When she's arrested, she will not have a trial, she will not pass go, she will go directly to jail. Then I change this file back to the original, and your mom disappears. 
DADE That's bullshit. 
PLAGUE What can I tell you. Computers never lie, kid. Your mom will be arrested at work, she'll be handcuffed, and later, strip searched. 
DADE You lay a finger on her and I'll kill you. 
PLAGUE Kid, don't threaten me. There are worse things than death and, uh, I can do all of them! 
Dade emerges from his room. His exhausted, overworked mother is asleep on the couch. He pulls a blanket over her. 
EXT. PUBLIC PHONE, WET STREET, NIGHT. 
Shortly after, Dade is outside on a payphone. 
PLAGUE Talk to me. 
DADE I got it. But listen, Kate didn't know what's on it. I mean, she came to me to figure it out. She's not the one who planted the virus. You leave her alone. 
PLAGUE Hey, don't worry, kid. If she's innocent, she'll be fine. Your mommy's safe now, okay? 
Dade hangs up and waits for some time.  A limousine drives by, with a skateboarder tailing. Plague grabs the disc, jumps in the limo and speeds away. Dade tries to chase but gives up quickly. 
INT. KATE'S ROOM. 
Dade shows up.  Kate, Nikon, and Cereal are working on the disc. 
DADE Kate, listen. 
KATE Uh, hold on... 
DADE I have to tell you something. 
CEREAL Hold on a second! 
NIKON Look at this, it's so lean and clean. 
CEREAL Looks like a hacker wrote it. 
KATE Come here, look at this. This thing is dense. 
Nikon points out part of the code. 
NIKON But that's ill, man. It's incomplete. This is taking forever and a day to figure out. I'm gonna make some coffee.

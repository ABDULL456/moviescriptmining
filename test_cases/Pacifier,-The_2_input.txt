FADE IN: 
EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY 
A fishing boat pushes over choppy water. FOUR GUN TOTING MEN on Jet Skis wearing black wet suits and goggles escort the boat. Flying above it is a HELICOPTER. 
INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS 
A SERBIAN MAN captains the wheel. SERB 2 scans the horizon with binoculars. He checks the GPS system, then his watch, then speaks into his throat mic. All italics are Serbian w/ subtitles: 
SERB 2 Fifteen minutes to delivery. 
EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS 
The JET SKIER in the lead weighs in on a radio. 
INT. SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS 
The HELICOPTER PILOT weighs in. 
PILOT All clear from above. 
EXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS 
The camera descends as the boat passes, and dives beneath the surface. 
EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS 
The droning of engines becomes less pronounced. Foam from the boat and skis bubbles. 
Calm. Then from out of nowhere five NAVY SEALs wearing RE- BREATHERS appear, in neat formation like the Blue Angels. JET PROPELLED BACKPACKS push the SEALs through the water. 
The LEAD SEAL: SHANE WOLFE, points upwards. All eyes follow his finger to the underbelly of the boat above. From his belt, Shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and FIRES. A cable shoots up -- THUD... The disc sticks to the boat's hull. Shane pushes a button on the wand retracting the cable and drawing himself closer. 
Dangling from the cruiser, Shane fixes a BOMB to the hull. He releases himself from the boat and speeds away -- 
BOOM. A dense explosion sends ripples through the water and ELECTRICITY crackling around the boat. 
INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS 
A SURGE of ELECTRICAL FORCE blasts from the control panel. SPARKS fly. 
The two Serbian Men jolt backwards -- WHAM -- and hit the wall. All the needles inside all the dials go LIMP. The roar of the engines DIES and the boat STOPS. 
EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN, UNDER THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS 
Shane slips inside the hull, through the new hole. 
INT. SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS 
The chopper slows to a hover.   The Pilot looks below. 
PILOT What's happening? 
EXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS 
The jet skiers protectively circle the injured boat in a SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING move, and the Jet Ski drivers are simultaneously YANKED below the surface: a split second later they're replaced by our SEALS (ALSO IN BLACK WET SUITS AND GOGGLES) -- the switch happens in less than a second, way too fast for anyone to notice. 
INT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS 
The shaken Serbs climb to their feet. 
SERBIAN 2 What happened? 
They look around, and see the SEALS, on the jet skis: In the masks they are indistinguishable from the GUN-TOTTING MEN they switched paces with. All seems clear. Serb 1 pushes on the throttle... nothing. 
SERBIAN 1 We've been hit. We're taking on water. 
Suddenly the boat lists -- and water pours in, under the cabin door. They spring into action! 
SERBIAN 1 (CONT'D) Grab the professor, quick!

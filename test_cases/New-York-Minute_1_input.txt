CONTINUED: ON MORTY -- making an abrupt halt. Baby?!          He turns around and lopes back to the suite. MORTY Mrs. Lo Biancho? I'm Mort Sestero, hotel security. MRS. LO BIANCHO Please!   Please help! MORTY Someone took your baby? MR. LO BIANCHO The Emperor is missing. MORTY (somewhat relieved) The Emperor is a dog, right? MRS. LO BIANCHO Not 'a' dog, no. THE NEW YORK KENNEL CLUB CHAMPION AND WHY AREN'T YOU TRYING TO FIND HIM! Morty pulls his RADIO as he backs out the door and heads down the hall. MORTY (to radio) This is Remote One to base, Remote One to base. Code 12, I repeat, Code 12. ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.) You goin' to lunch already, Morty? MORTY (impatient) Code 12 isn't lunch, Bruce! Didn't you read your manual? ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.) (beat) I will. MONTY Call NYPD.    We have a dognapping. ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.) A what? (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: MORTY Just call the damn police and patch me through. The Emperor's been kidnapped. ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.) Holy cripes, why didn't you say it was political?! MORTY Political?     THE EMPEROR IS A DOG, MORON! ANOTHER SECURITY GUY (V.O.) You want me to call NYPD about a dog? MORTY (decrying his fate) I am going to kill you, then fire you, Bruce. Got it? Kill, fire. That order. CUT TO: 
EXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE PLAZA - DAY Drew's still FROZEN on the fire escape. DREW I can't do it! PARKER Yes you can! 
ANGLE ON THE END OF THE ALLEY where Roger appears with The Emperor. Surprised        to see the girls, he backpedals, worried he'll be seen,       but they're too wrapped up in their own getaway and       he quietly makes his way to his VAN (painted on the       back and sides: "Michelangelo's Painting: A Masterpiece         every time". DREW No I can't! PARKER Have fun in prison. Under 'Summer Internships' on your college application, you can write 'license plate manufacturing.' (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Roger's VAN SQUEALS AWAY, drawing Parker's attention. She glimpses him in his side mirror as he disappears around the corner into traffic. Shutting her eyes, Drew drops onto the closed lid of the dumpster. DREW (astonished) I did it. Oops, the curtain starts to slip. When she reaches for it she loses her balance and suddenly -- FWONK -- nosedives into the dumpster. The curtain floats INTO THE ALLEY at Parker's feet. DREW (O.S.) OW! PARKER Get out of there! DREW (O.S.) (beat) Give me... my... curtain. Parker tosses the curtain in and Drew climbs out.        They hurry off down the alley. IN THE SECOND STORY FIRE ESCAPE WINDOW -- Morty appears. MORTY Stop!    Bring back that dog! MORTY'S POV -- The girls near the end of the alley. A small dog could easily be concealed under that shower curtain. ON THE GIRLS -- running full-tilt, Drew turns to Parker. DREW He thinks we have the dog! PARKER A painter took it! DREW A pain -- WHAM! -- Drew's       CLOTHESLINED at the intersection by a BIKE MESSENGER       who, in a valiant attempt to avoid her, brakes so hard       he flies off the handlebars and lands RIGHT ON TOP OF       HER.

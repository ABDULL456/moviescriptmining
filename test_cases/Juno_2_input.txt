MARK We definitely want it to have junk. 
JUNO Well don't worry about it. My stepmom is forcing me to eat really healthy. She won't even let me stand in front of the microwave or eat red M&Ms. Hope you're ready. 
Mark chuckles. 
MARK Wait...do you hear that? 
A new SONG has begun. Mark closes his eyes in ecstasy and walks toward the stereo. Juno follows him toward the source of the music, looking perplexed by how happy he is. 
JUNO What is it? 
MARK It's only my favorite song. It's Sonic Youth doing "Superstar" by the Carpenters. 
JUNO (excited) I've heard the Carpenters before. Chick drummer and freaky dude. Not unlike the White Stripes. 
MARK You haven't heard the Carpenters like this. Listen. 
Mark grabs the STEREO REMOTE off the kitchen counter and turns up the volume to a roar. Mark and Juno stand in silence in the kitchen. Mark mouths along with the lyrics. 
MARK (lipsynching) Don't you remember you told me you loved me, baby... 
JUNO Hey, I like this. 
MARK This album is all Carpenters covers by alt-rock bands. It's called If I Were a Carpenter. It is God. I'll rip a copy for you before you leave. 
JUNO You don't have to do that. 
MARK It's the least I can do. What did you say your favorite band was? 
JUNO I didn't. But it's a three-way tie between the Stooges, Patti Smith and the Runaways. 
MARK Yeah, I definitely need to make you some CDs. At least while my kid is hanging out in there. 
He gestures at Juno's burgeoning paunch. 
Mark walks over to his music collections and starts pulling CD's. He's got a Carpenter's disc, the "No Alternative" charity compilation, and Mother Love Bone. 
Juno spots a VHS TAPE on the coffee table and picks it up. 
JUNO (reading title) The Wizard of Gore? 
MARK (distracted) Oh yeah. It's Herschel Gordon Lewis. He's the ultimate master of horror. 
JUNO Please. Dario Argento is the ultimate master of horror. 
Mark SWIVELS AROUND slowly on his desk chair, surprised. 
MARK Argento's good, but Lewis is completely demented. We're talking buckets of goo. Red corn syrup everywhere. And fake brains up the yin-yang. 
JUNO (examining the tape box) Frankly, this looks kind of stupid. 
Mark gives a look - "Oh, Really?" 
INT. LORING HOUSE - DEN - AFTERNOON 
We see some particularly memorable footage from The Wizard of Gore. 
Mark and Juno are watching the movie and drinking root beer floats. They're sitting dangerously close on the sofa. 
JUNO (watching movie) This is even better than Suspiria. You've got decent taste in slasher movies, Mark. 
MARK Here's to dovetailing interests. 
He raises his mug in a toast and Juno clinks it awkwardly. 
JUNO So, have you and Vanessa thought of a name for the baby yet?

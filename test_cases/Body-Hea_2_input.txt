He takes a big bite of pie. 
LOWENSTEIN Oscar, I just don't understand how you could be doing advanced theoretical thinking like that and still be stuck working in our little town. 
GRACE (good-humored) Lowenstein dreams of bigger things. 
LOWENSTEIN Assistant County Prosecutor isn't the end for me, fellows. 
RACINE Hell, no. Someday -- Deputy County Prosecutor. 
LOWENSTEIN When the truth comes out about some of the dirt I've been involved in, (MORE)

LOWENSTEIN (CONT'D) my future in this state will be unlimited. 
Glenda the Meter Maid passes their table on her way out. She has eyes only for Racine. 
GLENDA Hello, Ned. 
RACINE Hi, Glenda. 
She goes out. Lowenstein and Grace look at Racine, then at each other. Grace smiles hugely. 
EXT. LIGHTHOUSE/SAND DUNES - NIGHT 
The big beacon turns in the distance, throwing an intermittent bridge of light across the water toward us. 
The undulating dunes stretch off as far as we can see. Racine's Stingray is parked on the dirt access road. Below it, Racine and Matty sit close in the warm sand. 
MATTY Don't say it, if you don't mean it. Please, Ned, don't. 
RACINE I do. I want you with me. 
She looks at him a long time. There is real joy in her face. And tears in her eyes. We're very close to those eyes as she wipes the tears away. Racine puts an arm around her. She looks out at the lighthouse. 
MATTY I'm going to tell Edmund I want a divorce. I won't stay any longer. I would have, if you hadn't come along. The life is comfortable. I was willing to go on. But you've reminded me of what it can be... I know now that these last three years I've been living half a life. It's my fault, I don't deny it. You have to let yourself be bought. I did. I let it happen. I've lived so much of my life with nothing. When you have no money, you have no choices. I don't care what they say -- money is freedom. That's something they don't teach you in school. But I found out. And when Edmund came along when I saw a chance to stop struggling I took it. I'm not ashamed. (MORE)

MATTY (CONT'D) He got   what he wanted... he has a knack   for that. But no more. I'm ready   to walk away from the money. I have   to be with you. 
RACINE (kisses her, smiles) It is conceivable I'll make a buck someday. 
MATTY (hugs him closer) Oh, I know you will, darling. I didn't mean that. I know you will. But it doesn't matter. It's you I want. That's all. 
RACINE Anyway, you'll come out all right. 
MATTY Of the divorce? 
RACINE Yeah.    He's ripe. 
Matty is silent for a long beat. 
MATTY No.   I signed a pre-nuptial agreement. 
RACINE What? 
MATTY He insisted. He blamed it on his sister Roz -- she's always hated me -- but I know he wanted it too. 
RACINE How is it? 
MATTY Bad. I get some money for a year. Not much. That's it. But I don't care, Ned. Not if I can be with you. 
She searches his face, almost frightened. 
MATTY Does it matter, Ned? Tell me the truth please. I'll understand, I swear to you. 
RACINE The truth? I wish you were going to be loaded. Does it matter? No. No.

They kiss. 
MATTY God, you've made me happy. (she pulls away) It's time for your present. 
She jumps up and runs back to the car. Racine walks back there as Matty takes a wrapped package out of the car. She hands it to Racine, who leans against the car to unwrap it. 
MATTY From now on, when it starts coming down on you, I'll be there to protect you. 
Racine opens the box and smiles broadly. It is a hat a fedora in the classic style. 
MATTY Put it on! I'll bet I guessed the size right. 
Racine puts on the fedora. It fits. He looks simultaneously old-fashioned, a visitor from the Forties, and also very chic, a present-day fashion plate. But most of all, he looks exactly right. Matty squeals in glee at the sight. 
MATTY I love it. 
RACINE I want to see. 
Racine tries to see his reflection in the car's side view mirror but he has trouble. Matty, very animated in her delight, steps up and kisses him quickly.

A ROOFTOP PARKING STRUCTURE 
A SKATE-PUNK (SQUID) gets some air, flipping his board up into a nice Ollie backside grab, then scoots over to -- 
-- THREE MORE PUNKS perched on a concrete ledge, watching the people below them.  They are: PROOF, FLICK and DINGO.  All in their teens, sporting copious piercings and tattoos.  Flick wears a ratty T-shirt from "The Lost Boys" movie. 
DINGO C'mon, just pick one. 
PROOF Once you buy a prize, it's yours and yours to keep. 
They keep looking.  Then, Flick suddenly points, excited -- 
FLICK Got it, got it!  Baby on board! 
ANGLE ON A MOUSY WOMAN (ABIGAIL) 
moving below, her figure camouflaged beneath layers of clothing.  She's in her 20s, lugging a NEWBORN in a BabyBjorn carrier that's strapped to her chest, clutching a bag of groceries in either hand.  She looks a little haggard. 
As we watch, she reaches an elevated rail station entrance. 
BACK TO THE SKATE-PUNKS 
Dingo nods and smiles approvingly. 
DINGO Looks like we got ourselves a combo meal. 
EXT. ELEVATED RAIL STATION - VARIOUS - NIGHT 
A series of shots as Abigail makes her way into the station, 
passing a few other PEOPLE here and there. 
INT. ELEVATED RAIL PLATFORM - NIGHT 
A depressing, dimly lit, partially open-air station.  Abigail moves out onto the platform, which is now deserted.  She glances around, a bit nervous, and finally sits on a bench. 
Beat.  Just the wind MOANING in the tunnels, across the platform.  Then we hear a RUSTLING SOUND -- 
Abigail looks right, sees nothing.  We hear ANOTHER SOUND, this time from the left -- 
Abigail looks up, briefly glimpsing a FIGURE ducking behind a concrete pillar. 
Unnerved, she stands, moving a protective hand over her baby. She backs up a few steps, trying to look around the pillar -- 
-- but no one is there.  Then a SHADOW MOVES behind her.  She SENSES it, spinning -- 
-- but again, she seems to be alone.  Thoroughly frightened now, Abigail scoops up her grocery bags, turns to exit and -- 
-- slams right into Dingo and Proof!  She GASPS. 
DINGO Hey, pretty lady. 
PROOF Sophisticated mama. 
Dingo and Proof reveal their fangs.  Abigail SCREAMS, runs -- 
-- right into the arms of Flick and Squid!  They grab her, RIPPING the BabyBjorn carrier from her chest, SHOVING her back at Dingo and Proof. 
In seconds, Dingo and Proof have Abigail on the floor. They're tearing away at her clothing, LAUGHING. 
DINGO Scream if this hurts, chica! 
ON FLICK, 
removing the BABY from its carrier.  He holds the baby up - only it's not a baby.  It's a DOLL with the words "FUCK YOU!" written on its chest.  Flick is briefly confused -- 
-- and then the baby doll EXPLODES, covering Flick's face with a cloud of GARLIC GAS! 
Flick recoils, retching, wiping at his burning face -- 
FLICK --aghhk -- it's fucking garlic! 
ON DINGO AND PROOF, 
looking back, alarmed.  Then Abigail pulls her knee to her chest.  A SILVER SPIKE springs out from the toe of her boot. 
She KICKS UP, imbedding the spike up through the underside of Proof's chin.  Proof ASHES. 
Before Dingo has a chance to act, Abigail gets him in a leglock, FLIPPING him back onto his ass.

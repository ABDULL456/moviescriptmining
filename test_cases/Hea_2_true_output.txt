HANNA Ridin' the airwaves. On every news channel. Turn on a fucking radio! (pause) Try to broker the Bonds. Make some money. Then you'll shift into Flip-o-matic and tell me who they are. And what they are doing next.

Enters. It's white and barren. A TV SET     in one corner on the floor PLAYS a MUTE GAME SHOW. Chris    is rolled up in a blanket in front of it. The apartment is    lived in by one man. It tells us Neil's personal life is    a blank. 
NEIL 
comes out of the bedroom with a pillow. He yanks Christ shoes off. Neil punches a number. RINGING. Then: 
CHARLENE (V.O.) (phone filter) Hello?

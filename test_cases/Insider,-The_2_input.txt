WIGAND (smiles, wry) Yeah, great. 
LOWELL I heard about the Kentucky gag order... 
WIGAND I don't know what to do. 
And they're quiet, a breeze of the Gulf ruffling their coats...  He looks out at the water, a cargo container ship passing by.  He watches its slow progress... 
And Jeffrey quietly starts to walk off across the lawn, hands in his pockets, shoulders bent, head down, thinking...  And Richard Scruggs comes out, tying his tie, to wait beside Lowell... 
EXT. COURTHOUSE, CANTY STREET, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
Motley's car parks, and he and an Assistant are approached by a flurry of media from the parking lot behind us, crossing Canty Street to intercept him.  And we SEE the lot is jammed with Mercedes-Benzes, Town Cars and limousines belonging to the 150-200 Big Tobacco, Wall Street lawyers.  Some hang out by their cars, killing time.  It's a tailgate party.  Beyond them are trucks and vans with satellite dishes supporting the media circus.  They're all here for Jeff's deposition.  The scale of it dwarfs the plebeian storefront with its sign "Temporary Jackson County Courthouse"...into which Motley enters... 
EXT. RICHARD SCRUGGS' HOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
Jeffrey contemplating. 
INT. COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
One TOBACCO LAWYER, an Edward Bennett-type while waiting is on his cell phone... 
TOBACCO LAWYER (into phone) Hold on a second... (seeing Motley enter; to Jr. Lawyer) Would you please ask Mr. Motley if he expects his witness to appear or not...? 
JR. LAWYER crosses to Motley. 
EXT. SCRUGGS' HOUSE, DOCK - DAY 
Jeffrey alone on the jetty, looking out to sea.  Trying to decide, trying to untangle identity and consequence.  A moment.  He turns, crossing to Lowell and Scruggs.  Then. it's the three men, standing on the lawn.  Time seems to slow...all of them aware it's a critical decision, personally and historically... 
WIGAND (severely conflicted) I can't seem to find...the criteria to decide.  It's too big a decision to make without being resolved...in my own mind. 
They're quiet.  Jeffrey, getting nowhere.  Lowell offers... 
LOWELL Maybe things have changed... 
Long pause on Jeffrey as he contemplates his future.  And something just got resolved.  He asks Lowell, rhetorically... 
WIGAND What's changed? 
LOWELL (unsure) You mean...since this morning? 
WIGAND No.  I mean since whenever... 
Nothing's changed.  Wigand looks at them.  He found his own answer. 
WIGAND (CONT'D) Fuck it.  Let's go to court. 
And Dick Scruggs and Lowell look at this normal, somewhat flawed, very courageous man... 
RICHARD SCRUGGS (to unseen staff) Dr. Wigand would like to leave now. 
And there's a sudden flurry of activity.  Jeffrey and Scruggs walk to a Mississippi State Police car.  Lowell gets into his car and drives away, separately.  Police, State Officials, run to their cars.  Cars starting, lights flashing, Wigand's car pulls into position. 
INT. SCRUGGS' CAR - JEFFREY - DAY 
in the back seat with Scruggs.  The driver's a State Policeman.  Jeffrey watches the small town of empty lots, old buildings, a 1930's Deco school pass by.  It's all heightened, especially vivid to his eyes somehow.  And he exhales heavily to calm himself, to focus... 
EXT. THE COURTHOUSE, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
Some of the Tobacco Lawyers, their jackets off, still hanging across Canty Street by their cars.  And now they see the police lights turning, coming around a corner, moving towards the courthouse.  The caravan stops.  First, Scruggs gets out. A moment, then Jeffrey appears.  And the Reporters pounce on Jeffrey, cameras flashing...Mississippi Police leading him through the crowd...  Moore appears at courtroom door (already there).  And as he's whisked away into the courtroom. 
INT. THE COURTROOM, PASCAGOULA, MISSISSIPPI - DAY 
The tobacco lawyers become dead quiet.  Cell phones are hung up.  Newspapers are put away.  Jackets are donned.  This is now very serious business.  Motley meets Jeffrey, all eyes on him. 
MOTLEY Okay, Jeff, I'm going to sit you down at that table over there.  I'm going to start as fast as possible.  I don't want to give them a chance to get another restraining order, okay?  Let's go. 
MICHAEL MOORE Good luck, Doc. 
Motley calmly motions Wigand to take a chair.  He settles in. 
STENOGRAPHER Please stand.  Raise your right hand... Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? 
WIGAND I do. 
STENOGRAPHER You may be seated. 
MOTLEY You understand, Dr. Wigand, you are under oath.  This is a sworn deposition. There's no judge.  It's not a trial. (understatement of the century) Will you state your name for the record. 
WIGAND (after a beat) Jeffrey S. Wigand.

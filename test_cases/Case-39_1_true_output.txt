Tiptoes down the hall. Quietly as possible as she comes past Lucy's door. It's open a crack. The room pitch black inside. Emily steps closer, breath held. Peers in through the little crack. Sees - 
LUCY ASLEEP IN BED. 
But suddenly her EYES SNAP OPEN. Her face horizontal on the pillow. 
LUCY I can see you. 
Emily backs away. Goes quickly to the front door. 
INT. EMILY'S CAR - NIGHT 
Emily throws the suitcase in the trunk. Slams it shut. Comes around to the driver's side door. Jumps in. Closes the door. And gets the scare of her life. 
LUCY IS SITTING IN THE PASSENGER SEAT! 
Emily recoils with a SCREAM, throwing her body against the window behind her. Lucy sits there, silent, betrayed. 
It's too much for Emily. She breaks down. Buries her face in her hands and sobs. 
Lucy, after a moment, takes a brush from Emily's bag and starts lovingly brushing her hair. 
Emily slowly lifts her head, resigning herself to this latest horror. She sits zombie-like behind the wheel, tears streaming as Lucy tugs gently at the snarls, playing mommy. 
LUCY Don't be sad. This is your new beginning. 
INT. EMILY'S CUBICLE - DAY 
Unopened mail and new case files piling up. Emily looks terrible, phone to ear, getting SCREAMED at, sworn at, interrupted every time she tries to speak. 
EMILY Mrs Lynch, I told you - will you let - that's not what I said - no, I did not - you never sent me the - Mrs Lynch - will you let me respond? - will you let me - Mrs Lynch - will you let - 
Emily can't take it anymore. She unloads. 
EMILY SHUT THE FUCK UP YOU MISERABLE MISERABLE WOMAN BEFORE I GET IN MY CAR AND COME OVER THERE AND BEAT YOUR ASS LIKE YOU BEAT YOUR SON! I HAVE YOUR ADDRESS! THINK ABOUT THAT NEXT TIME YOU CALL AND SWEAR AT ME! I KNOW WHERE YOU LIVE! 
Slams the phone down. Sits there looking rather dazed. Wayne arrives, dazed in a different way, having overheard. 
WAYNE Um, so, I notice you haven't taken any personal days. Come on, you look like crap, go home. 
Emily levels a withering stare. 
EMILY I don't want to go home. 
EXT. LOS ANGELES APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
Emily knocking on a door in an outside hallway. It opens. It's the girl from the bar. BECCA. The friend. Not expecting her. 
BECCA Emily... 
INT. BECCA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Emily, disheveled, five days without sleep, doing her best to appear rational. 
EMILY I know I haven't been a great friend lately, but... do you think maybe I could crash here for a couple of nights? 
BECCA Sure, when? 
EMILY Tonight and tomorrow. 
Becca draws air through her teeth, pained by her predicament. 
BECCA Em, any other weekend you know I'd say yes, but I just met this guy and he's coming over tonight like for the night and it might be, you know, kinda weird. 
Emily nods. And there's nothing more to be said. 
INT. EMILY'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Stormy night. Heavy rain. High winds. The trees, thrashing outside the window, backlit by a streetlight, cast OMINOUS SHADOWS on the walls of the bedroom. 
Emily huddles in the corner, wrapped in a blanket, clutching the screwdriver. 
There is a KNOCK on the bedroom door. Emily's EYES JERK WIDE OPEN. She looks at the door, but doesn't answer. 
After a moment, Lucy's voice, innocent, afraid - 
LUCY (O.S.) Emily...? Can I come in? I'm scared... 
Emily says nothing. Heart racing. There's another KNOCK. A little louder. 
LUCY (O.S.) Emily? Please? I know you're in there, please...? 
Emily says nothing. Lucy starts pounding on the door. 
LUCY (O.S.) Please, Emily...

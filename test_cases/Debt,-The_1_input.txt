She reaches the chair and climbs onto it. A pause and then, tentatively, she lifts her feet into the stirrups, tugging the gown to cover herself as best she can. 
She tries to steady her breathing, focussing on the ceiling. A bright LIGHT shines down on her. 
We hear footsteps approach. 
Rachel closes her eyes. VOGEL Good morning, Frau Roget. I'm Doctor Bernhardt. 
Rachel opens her eyes. Vogel is sitting on a small stool, taking a speculum from the tray of instruments, his back to us. 
RACHEL Good morning, doctor. 
He turns and smiles at us - and he has a wonderful, warm smile, the air of a gruff but kindly Uncle. 
VOGEL Alright now, just relax. We're going to do a little examination. If you feel at all uncomfortable, you just say. Alright? FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   25. 
She manages to nod. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Alright, this is my hand... and this is the speculum. It's going to feel cold. 
Rachel reacts as Vogel pushes the speculum into place, opens it and begins the examination. She stares up into the light. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Can I ask how old you are? 
RACHEL Twenty five. 
VOGEL And how long have you and your husband been trying for a baby? RACHEL Nearly two years. 
VOGEL Uhuh. Well, the ovaries look fine. Alright, let's see... your cervix is slightly retroverted. Tilted backwards? 
Rachel raises her hand to her LOCKET NECKLACE and begins to fiddle with it. 
RACHEL Really? The angle from which we next see VOGEL, and the way the image of his face freezes in black and white, tells us clearly that this locket conceals a CAMERA DEVICE. 
VOGEL Mmm. But that generally shouldn't affect fertility. 
RACHEL Oh, good. 
VOGEL You have a slight accent, Frau Roget. Where are you from? 
RACHEL Argentina. We just moved here... A few months ago. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09    26. 
VOGEL Whereabouts in Argentina? Buenos Aires? 
He looks up at her and Rachel instinctively moves her hand away from the locket. She finds herself nodding. 
Vogel looks away again. Rachel bites down on a wave of panic. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) Oh, Buenos Aires. Beautiful. I went once, when I was young. We went to the Opera house I remember. What's it called again? 
Rachel stares at the light. Beat. 
RACHEL Teatro Colon. He turns back to her, holding a swab, the warm smile. 
VOGEL That's right. Beautiful. This might sting a little, dear. 
Rachel winces. 
VOGEL (CONT'D) I'm sorry. Now, there's a couple of tests we need to run, make sure there are no problems. Is that alright? 
Rachel nods. He pats her hand. VOGEL (CONT'D) Brave girl. 
57    EXT. CLINIC - DAY                                             57 
Rachel walks out and finds David waiting, smoking. He takes her hand and they walk off without speaking. 
58    EXT. QUIET STREET - DAY                                       58 
The two turn the corner, out of sight of the clinic. David glances at her. She looks pale, shaken. He feels a wave of sudden tenderness for her, opens his mouth to say something then catches himself. 
CLOSE on their hands. After a moment David LETS GO. They walk on. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   27. 
59    INT. BAR - DAY                                               59 
Stephan sits at a table. Rachel and David appear beside him and join him. There is an awkward silence for a moment. Stephan sips his coffee. 
STEPHAN (in German) So. Everything...? 
RACHEL (in German, abruptly) Next appointment is on Wednesday. 
She looks at David but he is staring at the table. Like Stephan he is uncomfortable with the thought of what Rachel has been through. 
She takes his hand. He looks up, surprised, searches her face... But then Rachel lets go and walks off towards the toilets. 
David looks down at the SILVER LOCKET lying in his palm. 
60    EXT. STREET - DAY                                            60 
Stephan walks down the street. A SMARTLY DRESSED MAN walks towards him, absently jingling his CAR KEYS in his hand. 
As he nears Stephan, the man fumbles the keys and they drop. Stephan dips down to pick them up and hands them back to the man with a smile.

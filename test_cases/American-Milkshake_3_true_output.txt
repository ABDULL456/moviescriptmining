ELLIOTT Come on, Haroon. Let's get you home. 
JOLIE Already? 
Haroon follows him down the steps. 
HAROON Elliott, will you go over this skit with me. I think you'll really like it and I need to practice or I'm gonna get a B in... 
There voices fade into silence. 
Jolie stands alone, grabs a dumb bell and does a few curls. He pushes it up his bicpt with his hand so that it looks bigger. 
INT. HENRIETTA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Jolie climbs in through the window. 
The only light in the room comes from the Sega on pause. 
HENRIETTA I knew you'd be back. 
JOLIE Because you know I love you. 
Jolie kissed her with lots of tongue. 
HENRIETTA Whatever. 
JOLIE What? 
Jolie smiles. 
JOLIE You're the best. I love you forever Henrietta. 
HENRIETTA You promise. 
JOLIE I promise to God. 
HENRIETTA Are you gonna help take care of my baby? 
JOLIE I'd do anything for you. 
Jolie turns off the TV, and in the near darkness of just a night light quietnly mounts her. 
HENRIETTA Wait. I want you to know... There's some stuff. I feel like you're the only one I can trust, the only one I can talk too. Like about when I ran away, and let those kids take photos of me. I couldn't tell anyone but you. You know that right? 
JOLIE I know. They were just photos. Everyone makes mistakes. 
Henrietta caresses his face and they kiss. 
HENRIETTA (VOICE OVER) Jolie's stupid. He'll believe anything. But I like him. I've been failing algebra just so he can tutoring me. 
EXT. HENRIETTA'S MOONLIT HOME 
The automatic sprinkler goes off. 
HENRIETTA (CONT'D) The thing is. He's not like other guys. I mean, he's on the team, but he's not really a cool kid. I've always hated the cool kids. 
Jolie steps off the porch and trips on a crack in the sidewalk. 
INT. DIMLY LIT GIGANTIC AUDITORIUM - DAY 
The theater class is spread out, bored and chatty. In the distance a girl is practicing dance steps on stage. 
Christine walks down the aisle and sits next to Jolie. 
CHRISTINE Hey Jolie. Have you seen this article? 
Jolie is dressed in basketball attire - it's a game day. Christine is in her hot cheerleader uniform. 
JOLIE What? No. Lemme see. 
She hands Jolie a newspaper. Their hands touch briefly, they lock eyes - a moment passes between them. 
JOLIE Wow. I heard Francisco got arrested but I didn't know he made the paper. 
CHRISTINE I heard he got arrested because him and a bunch of other kids banged that pregnant girl Henrietta for a dollar or something. 
A REDHEAD dude with an orange hoody turns around with a spnoonful of green Jell-O, eating from his Tupperware bowl.

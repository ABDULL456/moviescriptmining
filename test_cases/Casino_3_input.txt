SIGNALER Well, I... I never tried. 
ACE So, you're a righty? 
SIGNALER Ye-yeah. 
ACE nods to one of the GUARDS. Instantly a large rubber mallet smashes onto the man's right hand four times to the sound of screams. ACE watches. 
ACE Now, you're gonna have to learn with your left hand. 
SIGNALER God! (He moans and sits back.) 
WINNER (O.S.) (From following scene) It's a hundred... 
INT. CASINO CASHIER'S CAGE AREA - NIGHT 
The WINNER has been standing outside the cashier's cage waiting for his $110,000 in chips to be cashed. SHERBERT walks up behind him. 
WINNER ...a hundred ten. 
CASHIER Yes, it is. 
WINNER I think. 
CASHIER Yes. 
WINNER Okay. 
SHERBERT Hiya. That's a lot of money to be counting out in public. 
WINNER Yeah. 
SHERBERT (To CASHIER) Why don't I take him over to the office and verify it, huh? 
CASHIER Yes. 
SHERBERT A little privacy. And, by the way, send over a... nice bottle of champagne on ice, huh? 
CASHIER Sure will. 
SHERBERT Real special.  Somethin'... (To WINNER.) By the way...  I'm Billy Sherbert, your casino manager. 
He shakes hands with the WINNER. 
WINNER Hi. 
SHERBERT Having a good time? 
SHERBERT leads him away from the cage. 
WINNER Yes, uh... 
SHERBERT You'll want to count the money in privacy. You know, you don't need... 
WINNER Uh, I have a plane to catch to Cleveland...  Can I get my winnings? 
INT. BASEMENT MAINTENANCE ROOM - NIGHT 
The WINNER is pushed through the door by two GUARDS followed by SHERBERT and sees his pal moaning in pain and holding his broken hand. 
SIGNALER Look what they did to my hand, man! 
ACE (Walks over to the WINNER) All right, I'm gonna give you a choice. You can either have the money and the hammer or you can walk out of here. You can't have both. What do you want? 
SHERBERT stands next to the WINNER 
WINNER I just wanna get out of here. 
ACE And don't forget to tell your friends what happens if they fuck around in here. You understand? 
WINNER I'm sorry. I made a bad mistake. 
ACE You're fuckin' right, you made a bad mistake. 'Cause if you come back here - we catch either one of you - we're gonna break your fuckin' heads and you won't walk out of here. You see that fuckin' saw?  We're gonna use it. You don't fuck around in this place. You got it? 
WINNER Yeah. 
ACE Get out of here. 
WINNER Thank you. 
The GUARDS usher the WINNER out of the room. 
ACE (To the GUARDS, referring to the SIGNALER) Throw him out in the alley.  And just tell the cops he got hit by a car. 
INT. ACE'S TANGIERS PENTHOUSE 
ACE and GINGER are alone in the living room. The apartment looks out on the glittering neon signs of the Strip. 
ACE (V.O.) Within no time, everything was set in place. We got rid of the freelance scamsters. The per was way up.  The gods were happy, or as happy as the gods can ever be.  And I, I decided to complicate my life. For a guy who likes sure things, I was about to bet the rest of my life on a real longshot. 
ACE We're not getting any younger. Don't you think it's time? Aren't you gettin' tired of all this shit? Bangin' around, hustlin' around? 
GINGER What, are you trying to handicap me? 
ACE I'm gonna do you one better. I'm trying to marry you. You want to marry me? (GINGER looks doubtful.) I'm serious. I mean, I - I want to settle down. I want a family. 
GINGER (Sighs, laughing) You got the wrong girl, Sam. 
ACE I know I'd be a good father. I know you'd be a good mother. 
GINGER You don't know me. What, you've known me, two, three months. What do you know? 
ACE I'm forty-three years old. I don't want to wait. I know you well enough to know that I really love you very much.  And I can't think of anybody better to be with. And I don't feel like waiting anymore. 
GINGER You know a lot of happily married people, Sam? 'Cause I don't. 
ACE Yeah, I know all that. 
GINGER I care about you, a - But I just don't have those kind of feelings for you. I'm sorry. I'm not in love with you. 
ACE (Brushing cigarette ash off his dressing gown) I - I - I... 
GINGER Understand? (Pause) I'm sorry. 
ACE No, I - I... mean...  that can grow as I - as long as there's a mutual respect... that kind of thing can grow. I'm realistic. I can accept that. But, you know, what is... What is love anyway?  It's a... it's a mutual respect. It's - it's a devotion. It's a... it's a caring from one person to another. And if we could set up some kind of foundation...  based on that mutual respect...  I feel that eventually you would care enough about me... that I could live with that. 
GINGER If it doesn't work out. You know, if it doesn't play out, then what happens to me? 
ACE You know I'm doin' well now. And I'm gonna do even better. And so, whatever happens, if it doesn't work out between us, I'm gonna make sure you're okay for the rest of your life. And if there are kids, especially, you know, I'll take care of you better than you'd ever imagine. 
GINGER (Interrupts) What're you... what're you pitching me, here? 
ACE Just what I said. You'll be set up for the rest of your life. That I can promise you. (Pause) Want to take a chance? 
She looks at him. ACE is holding her hand tightly. 
INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM MARRIAGE - NIGHT 
ACE and GINGER are seated at a banquet table with various guests, drinking champagne. AMY, their six-month-old child is in a cradle. NICKY and JENNIFER are hovering around the baby with LITTLE NICKY and are blissfully happy. It is an elegant affair.  City Officials, politicians and gaming officials are there, plus, SHERBERT and Ace's boss, PHILIP GREEN. A photographer takes pictures of the guests. 
ACE (V.O.) When I married Ginger I knew all the stories, but I didn't give a fuck. 'I'm Sam Rothstein,' I said. 'I can change her.' 
NICKY (V.O.) It was typical Ace. He invited the biggest people in town and he knew they'd show. Because he knew they all wanted somethin' from him.  With Ace, nobody ever got a free ride. Even Ginger. With her - 
We see AMY in the cradle. 
NICKY (V.O.) - he still covered his bets. They had to have the baby first, before they got married. Even made Jennie and me watch Amy for a few days when they went on their honeymoon. But I didn't mind, we loved the kid. 
IN SLOW MOTION CAMERA MOVES IN ON ACE AND GINGER, STANDING NEXT TO A LARGE WEDDING CAKE. THEY ARE KISSING. NICKY, SHERBERT AND OTHER GUESTS LOOK ON. 
CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER AS THEY KISS, THEN PAST THEM TO THE BRIDE AND GROOM FIGURINES ON THE CAKE. 
LESTER's and GINGER's telephone conversation is heard in voice-over this scene. 
LESTER (Over telephone) Can you feel my eyes on you? Can you feel me look into your heart?  Can you feel me in the pit of your stomach? Can you feel me in you? In your heart? 
We see a wide view of the elaborate wedding, guests mill about the banquet hall. 
LESTER Don't make me come there. Answer me. 
GINGER (Over telephone, sobbing) I love you. 
INT. LESTER DIAMOND'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - NIGHT 
LESTER DIAMOND is talking on the phone softly, cutting up cocaine on a piece of glass. 
LESTER (Into telephone) Bub-ut, baby, do you know that I love you too? 
GINGER (Over telephone) No, Lester. 
LESTER (Into telephone) Do you know that? 
GINGER (Over telephone) Yeah. This is the best thing I can do for my life right now. 
LESTER (Into telephone) That's right. 
INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
GINGER is sitting alone on the phone. She's crying. 
LESTER (Over telephone) So, it's gonna be okay, isn't it? 
GINGER (Sobbing, into telephone) Promise? 
LESTER (Over telephone) God... I wish you... 
INT. LESTER DIAMOND'S LOS ANGELES APARTMENT - NIGHT 
There is a beautiful scantily dressed blonde girl in the apartment with him. She bends down to the table in front of him, snorts some cocaine, then walks away. 
LESTER (Into telephone) ...all the luck in the world. 
GINGER (Over telephone) You do? 
LESTER (Into telephone) Yeah, I do. I mean, it's - it's the - it's the best thing you can do right now. I mean this. And you'll have real security.  Sweetheart... you're gonna be situated just right in Vegas. 
INT. RIVIERA BALLROOM CORRIDOR - NIGHT 
ACE enters from the ballroom and sees GINGER on the phone. He walks towards her, listening to her conversation. 
LESTER (Over telephone) Come on, this is great for us. You know I'm gonna be here for you. I ain't going no place. Huh?  I'm lookin' at you right now. I'm seein' you for the very first time, right this minute. I'm seein' you, and I can feel my heart click. I see you fourteen years old. I see you the first second I ever saw you. I see you, long-legged little colt - 
GINGER notices ACE behind her. 
LESTER - with stupid braces on your teeth.

The car drives off. Carleton grins. \nCARLETON Fucking Danny, man... \nBILLINGS He's an asshole. \nINT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT -- TWILIGHT \nCarla leads Danny through the darkened apartment. \nINT. CARLA'S ROOM -- TWILIGHT \nAn old bookcase full of leather-bound German volumes...Danny opens one marked Hofmannsthal. He tries to read a marked passage. \nDANNY \"...und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze...\" \nCARLA \"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms...\" \nDANNY How come so many of the books are in Spanish? \nCARLA They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met. \nDANNY Are they still together? \nCARLA He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on. \nDANNY Is he a Nazi? \nCARLA I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that. \nDANNY What's he care about? \nCARLA Killing himself. \nThey look at each other. There's that gulf between them that they have to cross, but they're not sure how. \nDANNY You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness? \nCARLA That's stupid. Why would they? \nHe shrugs. She takes his hand, rubs the bruised knuckles. \nCARLA You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends. \nDANNY Yes, I am. Basically I am. \nShe leans close, whispers.... \nCARLA Hurt me. \nHe's surprised, but not very. He grabs her wrist, twists it. \nCARLA Ow! That's too hard. \nHe pulls her out of frame. She starts to say something, but it's cut off by another CRY OF PAIN. We keep looking out the window.... \nINT. SAME -- LATER \nThe light has shifted across the city, and we hear only a muffled sobbing. \nThe CAMERA TURNS to look at...Carla and Danny naked on the bed. He lies back, reading the German book. She's curled on her side, weeping abjectly. Still sobbing, she rolls over, buries her face in his chest. We see that his neck is scratched up. \nCARLA Do it again.... \nShe begins to fondle him. He ignores it until he finishes the poem, then turns to her. \n", "test1_true": "The light has shifted again. Danny sleeps alone, his face strangely innocent. Carla drops onto the bed, shakes him. \nCARLA Get up...you gotta go. \nHe opens his eyes. She's dressed, her hair wet from the shower, a faint puffiness around her mouth. He pulls her down to him. \nCARLA No, you have to leave. I've got to write a paper. (slaps his stomach hard) Out! \nHe looks up. Her face is cold, indifferent. He gets to his feet. \nINT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT -- DAY \nDanny on his way to the door, hears something, turns...CURTIS ZAMPF is coming out of a bedroom in his underwear. From within... \nLINA MOEBIUS (O.S.) Bring the paper, too. \nCurtis now sees Danny. A look between them. Danny goes out. \nEXT. QUEENS, STAIRS TO ELEVATED TRAIN -- DAY \nOnce a Jewish neighborhood, now occupied chiefly by blacks, Latins and more recent immigrants. \nAs Danny (wearing headphones) comes down the steps... TWO BLACK KIDS (big, menacing, boombox) are coming up, blocking his way. Danny walks right between them, forcing them apart. \nThey turn, glare after him. He turns, glares back. They scoff and keep going up. He walks on. \nEXT. OZONE PARK HOUSE -- DAY \nHe lets himself into a row house. We barely notice the mezzuzah on the door post. \nINT. OZONE PARK HOUSE -- DAY \nA nearly vanished world of lower-middle-class Jewish life, though the \"Jewishness\" (menorah, kiddush cup...) is restricted to one dusty corner behind a secular chaos of books, newspapers, half-empty cups, half-filled glasses... \nDanny's FATHER, 55, sits on a faded chair, an oxygen mask on a cart beside him. Danny's sister, LINDA, 30, is cutting his hair with a scissors. When Danny enters, they both look up at him in surprise, alarm, possibly even love. For a moment no one knows what to do. \nThe father begins to wheeze, puts the mask over his face and breathes deeply. Linda tells him to lean back; resumes cutting. On the wall we see Danny's BAR MITZVAH PHOTO. \nMeanwhile, Danny has found a stack of mail, all addressed to him. His father and sister are visible behind him in a mirror. Without speaking, he goes down the hall, and we hear him DESCEND STAIRS to: \nINT. HOUSE, BASEMENT -- DAY \nDanny has taken off his coat (revealing a black T-shirt with a red swastika), and is going through a number of cardboard boxes marked \"D,\" pulling out comic books, baseball gloves, martial arts gear, drawings of voluptuous women, morbid gothic figures, gun magazines, books about Hitler, Nazis...and finally a .22 AUTOMATIC stuffed in a blue sock. \nINT. HOUSE, BASEMENT \nHe removes the clip, checks the slide, while nodding to the MUSIC coming through his earphones. He looks up, sees LINDA at the foot of the stairs, pulls off the headset. \nLINDA I knocked, you didn't answer. \nIt's too late to conceal the gun; he places it beside him. She does her best to ignore the swastika shirt.... \nLINDA What are you doing here? \nDANNY I just came to get some stuff. I'll be out in five minutes. (off her) He doesn't want me around. \nShe looks down as if that were not true, or the way in which it is too complicated to go into. \nLINDA He's going to die. (as Danny looks away) He won't take his medicine. He eats dairy. He probably still smokes when I'm not around. (off Danny's helpless gesture) I asked him to come live with us. Alex offered to share his room, unsolicited.... But he didn't want to be any trouble. \nDANNY Then he couldn't be bitter about living alone. \nLINDA Why deprive him of his greatest pleasure? \nThey exchange what are almost smiles. But then the subject she's been trying to avoid -- the only subject -- suddenly erupts... \nLINDA Ah, Jesus Christ, Danny, how can you wear that thing?... You know what it means? To your people... \nDANNY They're not my people.... \nLINDA Tell it to Hitler. \nDANNY Oh, he decides? Hitler's the chief rabbi now?... \nLINDA Is this because of those kids who used to beat you up? \nDANNY What kids?... \n", "test1_id": 1956, "test2_input": "The Waiter ignores the innuendo, readies his order pad. \nBILLINGS Ham and cheese on white. \nFIRST WAITER (forbearance) We don't have ham. We don't have cheese. \nBILLINGS What the hell do you have? \nFIRST WAITER That's what the menus are for. \nHe smiles. Billings glares. \nO.L. Roast beef and Swiss. \nFIRST WAITER I said: no cheese. \nO.L. What's wrong with cheese? \nFIRST WAITER This is a kosher restaurant. We don't serve meat with dairy. \nDANNY What about chicken? \nFIRST WAITER That's meat. \nDANNY The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk. \nFIRST WAITER Look, you want cheese, go someplace else. \nDANNY But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid. \nFIRST WAITER No, I don't admit it's stupid. \nDANNY You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that? \nFIRST WAITER I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like -- \nDANNY But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid? \nFIRST WAITER (calling the other Waiter) Steve... \nDANNY Steve's going to explain it. \nSteve approaches, a sawed-off broom handle over his shoulders. \nSTEVE We have a problem here? \nBILLINGS We sure fucking do. We don't understand why you can't eat chicken with milk. It doesn't make sense. \nSTEVE (an intellectual) Religion isn't about making sense. It's about -- \nDANNY It's about the incomprehensible, Steve, not the idiotic. \nSTEVE Fuck you. \nDANNY That explains it! Now we understand! \nThe Nazis laugh. Steve swings the broom handle at Danny...who ducks it, grabs it, slams it back at him.... GAVEL RAPS... \nINT. COURTROOM -- DAY \nA JUDGE (white-haired, red-faced, blue-eyed, well-meaning) peers down at the four NAZIS, still bruised from the fight. \nJUDGE ...As the altercation appears to have been instigated equally on both sides, prison terms strike the court as excessive. \nThe Nazis are relieved. Spectators disappointed. \nJUDGE However, the defendants' political views suggest that they might profit from contact with members of our community whose experiences differ from their own.... \nINT. A SOCIAL ROOM -- DAY \nNUMBERS TATTOOED ON AN ARM...a thumb steadily smooths the skin as: \nRUMANIAN WOMAN (O.S.) (Rumanian accent, uninflected) ...When I refused to have sex with him, the warden had my sister, Esther, executed in front of the entire block.... \nThe Nazis, accompanied by a \"HATE COUNSELOR\" (male) sit in plastic chairs opposite five elderly JEWS. The speaker is in her late 60s, still something of a beauty. \nRUMANIAN WOMAN ...Everyone considered it my fault. After that, of course, I did anything he wanted. \n", "test2_true": "SNICKERING among the Nazis, a whispered crack: \nO.L. Who'd want to fuck her anyway? \nHATE COUNSELOR I hear one more remark like that, we go back to the court for resentencing. \nRUMANIAN WOMAN He was a pig, like you, so perhaps he had no taste. \nThe Nazis laugh. The Jews try to calm the woman, though she has spoken without any evident emotion. Billings gets up restless. \nHATE COUNSELOR Sit down, please. (as Billings sits) Thank you, Mrs. Cohen. Mr Liebowitz, you indicated you had a story you wanted to tell.... \nINT. SAME -- LATER \nNazis are dozing, staring out the window. O.L. threads a piece of dental floss through the zipper pull on his trousers. Danny is visibly disgusted by the whole business. Over this we hear: \nPOLISH MAN (O.S.) ...The man was afraid to let us hide on his farm any longer, but he agreed to take us to a more remote place. On the way he was stopped at a checkpoint, and when the soldiers found us in the hay, one of them grabbed my son out of my arms. He began to cry, so I reached for him, not to take him back, simply... \nTHE MAN: mid-70s, tall, stooped, a crushed spirit. \nPOLISH MAN ...simply to assure him I was there. But the sergeant became enraged.... He stuck his bayonet in my son's chest, and lifted him up, impaled on it. My son was three years old.... \nBillings is muttering, \"What a load of crap...\" The Hate Counselor looks over sharply. The other Nazis are stunned by the story. Danny can barely contain himself, though we are not sure why. \nPOLISH MAN ...He held him up so that the blood spurting out of him feel on my face.... The soldiers were laughing. \nFLASHCUT: EXT. A COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY \nA horse hitched to a hay wagon; FARMER driving. THREE NAZI SOLDIERS have discovered a Jewish family hiding in the hay. A sergeant is holding up something unseen on the end of his rifle. \nThe Polish man who has been telling the story looks up at whatever it is. Blood falls on him. The Nazis are laughing. \nPOLISH MAN (O.S.) When the blood stopped, the sergeant pushed my son off the bayonet and said, \"There, you can have him now....\" \nBACK TO SCENE: INT. A SOCIAL ROOM -- DAY \nThe room is silent. The Nazis faces blank, shaken. Until... \nDANNY And what did you do? \nHATE COUNSELOR What are you trying to say? \nDANNY What did you do while the sergeant was killing your son? \nBILLINGS Forget it, Danny, it's all bullshit. \nHATE COUNSELOR Wait a second... \nDANNY (to Billings) Shut up. (to man, mid-70s) What did you do? \nRUMANIAN WOMAN What could he have done? \nDANNY What could he have done?? You fucking kikes... \nHATE COUNSELOR You can't say that.... \nDANNY The Nazi's killing his kid. He could've jumped the guy. He could've gouged his eyes out, grabbed the bayonet and gutted him.... What would you have done if they were killing your son? \nThe counselor is briefly confused.... \nRUMANIAN WOMAN & OTHERS ...They'd have shot him on the spot.... He would have been dead in two seconds.... Who are you judge? \nHATE COUNSELOR (to Danny) Please sit down. \nDANNY SO THEY SHOT HIM! SO HE WAS DEAD. SO WHAT. HE'S WORSE THAN DEAD NOW. HE'S A PIECE OF SHIT... \nHATE COUNSELOR Okay, that's it. You're going back to -- \nDANNY (over him, to Polish man) What do you think you should have done? \nPOLISH MAN And you, you think you know what you would have done? You have no idea. You can't even imagine what that was like. And you never will.... \nBILLINGS Don't listen to them, Danny. It's all a bunch of crap. \nANCIENT JEW What is crap? \nBILLINGS The so-called Holocaust.

Climb onto the kitchen roof, I'll leave the window open. \nHe tries to kiss her, but she ducks away and goes out. \nEXT. STREET/INT. O.L.'S VAN -- EVENING \nDanny is parked opposite a fortresslike building of soiled brick. For a long time he cannot bring himself to get out. Finally he opens the door.... \nINT. AHAVAT TORAH, FOYER -- EVENING \nA LARGE WOMAN, about 40, her body barely contained by a brilliant magenta dress, greets him with a smile the size of a wedding cake. She holds out a prayer book stuffed with flyers. \nLARGE WOMAN Shabbat shalom. \nShe speaks quietly, not wanting to disturb the service, yet even so her voice is huge, and her flashing eyes clearly expect some kind of enthusiastic response. Within we hear the ALENU being chanted. \nDanny ignores her and the proffered siddur. A basket of yarmulkes seems to infuriate him, but he snatches one anyway and, conveying a helpless disgust, puts it on his head. From within he hears... \nCONGREGATION (O.S.) (in rough unison) Ba-yom, ha-hoo, ba-yom, ha hoo...(etc.) \nHe stands with his hand on the door, but not opening it. \nRABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE (O.S.) On that day, the Eternal shall be One. And His Name shall be One.... \nThe organist plays a brief decrescendo.... \nRABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE The mourner's kaddish can be found on page 187.... \nLARGE WOMAN Is anything wrong? \nDANNY Shut the fuck up. \nShe's startled but not intimidated, is about to respond, when Danny simply turns and walks out of the building. \nEXT. AHAVAT TORAH -- EVENING \nHe stops beneath an open window through which he hears... \nRABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE ...Grant us peace, thy most precious gift, O Thou Eternal source of peace. We recall with loving memory those whom Thou hast summoned unto thee. And we mention by name...Sophie Budnitz...Bernard Schwabb...Milton Lifter...Aaron Lustig...Minnie Baum... \nDanny closes his eyes, but at the end adds, under her breath: \nDANNY ...Harriet Kantor Balint... \nA half dozen VOICES, including Danny's, recite in unison... \nDANNY & OTHERS Yis-ga-dal v'yis-ka-dash sh'may ra-bo... \nThe body of the congregation joins in on certain phrases, producing a subtle and solemn music. Danny chants the entire prayer, and the moment it ends, and the rabbi begins the benediction.... \nRABBI'S VOICE (AMPLIFIED) May the Lord bless you and keep you.... \nEXT. AHAVAT TORAH/STREET -- EVENING \n...he starts toward his car. But the Rabbi's VOICE seems to follow him, unnaturally loud and clear: \nRABBI (O.S.) May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you.... \nDANNY (to himself) Eat shit.... \nRABBI (O.S.) ...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming.... \nDANNY (shouting to the empty street) EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES.... \nRABBI (O.S.) And let us say... \nRABBI & CONGREGATION (with organ; singsong) Ah -- ah -- ah....men.... \nAs Danny reaches the van, he sees the LARGE WOMAN silhouetted in the open doorway.... \nLARGE WOMAN YOU EAT SHIT. \n", "test3_true": "A WRISTWATCH: 12:05. We are: \nEXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT \nDanny hoists himself onto the kitchen roof. Above him is an open window, candlelight flickering. He starts into the room, stops.... \nINT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nCarla sits on the bed, straddling Curtis, who lies beneath her. She is looking right at Danny. Curtis, unaware of him, keeps thrusting into her from below. \nDanny starts to leave, but on second thought stays. Carla stares expressionless, yet more attentive to him than to Curtis. Indeed, their eyes never leave each other, so that when she becomes aroused, we understand that it is Danny she is responding to, Danny she is really making love to. \nGradually her face loses its aloofness and seems to reach out to him, to reveal feelings that she can no longer deny. She holds her gaze until, at the final instant, she shudders out a series of stifled cries. \nWhen she looks again, the window is empty. \nINT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- DAY \nDanny reading. A KNOCK at the door. He looks up, Curtis comes in. Danny stiffens at the sight of him, but Curtis is friendly. \nCURTIS What are you reading? \nDanny tilts the book to show him: History of Political Philosophy. \nCURTIS Leo Strauss... (nods approvingly) I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye. \nDANNY What about Mrs. Moebius and...? \nCURTIS They left an hour ago. (off Danny's disappointment) You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on. (off Danny's silence) How soon can you get back to the city? \nDANNY A week or so. There's something I want to do here first. \nCURTIS What's that? (off Danny's silence) Okay. Surprise us... \nINT. DARKNESS -- NIGHT \nThe sound of SPLITTING WOOD. Then VOICES in a cavernous space... \nCHAOS OF VOICES Ow, shit... You're stepping on my fucking -- ...Get off me...Goddammit... (sounds of PUNCHES, a SCUFFLE) Stop it!... Where's the light? \nOne appears, illuminating nothing, dissipating into the still vaster darkness. A SERIES OF LIGHTS bang on in ecclesiastical bursts, illuminating: a vaulted ceiling... stained glass panels... We are: \nINT. SYNAGOGUE SANCTUARY -- NIGHT \nA dour, ornate place built in the early decades of the century. The sight of it silences everyone for a moment. Then... \nCARLETON Jew World...!! \nDrake, Billings, Carleton, O.L. and Steroid run wild... kicking over benches...spray-painting swastikas...hurling prayer books...urinating from the balcony... \n...Danny looks around like someone revisiting his childhood home: slides his hand along a pew back...leafs through a chumash...gazes up at the eternal lamp behind its red glass...the gilded doors of the ark... A hint of Kol Nidre MUSIC haunts him.... \nDANNY (to himself, barely a whisper) Shut up. Fuck you.... \nKYLE (O.S.) What...? \nDanny turns; Kyle is right behind him. \nDANNY Nothing. Where is it? (as Kyle hoists a sports bag) Okay, let's take one of these panels off so we can get under the bema...the stage. \nAs they unscrew a panel, Carleton runs past. A football flashes overhead. We hear GLASS BREAK...LAUGHTER. \nINT. UNDER THE STAGE -- NIGHT \nDANNY WATCHES KYLE attach a bomb (four sticks of dynamite wired to a digital timer) to a 2x4 with a bungee cord. He hooks the ends, cautiously lets go. The cord springs free. The bomb falls. \nKyle gasps. Danny catches it. \nFrozen, they look at each other. Kyle exhales, takes the bomb and, with Danny holding it, carefully restrings the bungee. A MECHANICAL NOISE overhead: \nSTEROID (O.S.) Wow, look at this shit.... \nDANNY What are they doing? \nKyle has no idea and doesn't care. Danny scrambles out. \nINT. SANCTUARY -- NIGHT \n", "test3_id": 1958}

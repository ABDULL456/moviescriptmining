{"train": "THE BELIEVER \nWritten by \nHenry Bean & Mark Jacobson \nFinal Shooting Script \nBLACK SCREEN \nRAV ZINGESSER \"And God said to Abraham, 'Take your son, your only son, whom you love, Isaac, and go into the land of Moriah and offer him there for a sacrifice upon a mountain that I will show you...\" \nINT. YESHIVA CLASSROOM -- DAY \nA run-down place. A dozen 12-year-old BOYS sit at old- fashioned desks. These are not Hasidim, but Orthodox Jews: normal American kids in yarmulkes. The teacher, RAV ZINGESSER is young, overweight, acnescarred, good-humored. \nRAV ZINGESSER And why did the Holy One -- blessed be He -- do this? Why did he ask Abraham to sacrifice his only son, whom he loved? \nTwo boys off to one side: AVI (a smart, tough, brownnose) and DANNY (the eternal dissident) argue under their breath.... \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Isaac wasn't his only son. Ishmael was his son, too. \n12-YEAR-OLD AVI The only son he loved. \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Oh, they only kill them when they love them...? \n12-YEAR-OLD STUART (up front; answering Zingesser) It was a test of Abraham's faith. Of his devotion to God. \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY It's not about Abraham's faith. It's about God's power. God says, \"You know how powerful I am? I can make you do anything I want, no matter how stupid. Even kill your own son. Because I'm everything, you're nothing.\" \nTITTERS. Danny looks around at his classmates: nerds, wankers, nose-pickers. Two kids in back furtively read the racing form under their desks. He hates them for their indifference as much as he despises Stuart's piety or Avi's ass-kissing. \nRAV ZINGESSER But, Danny, if HaShem is everything, and we are nothing how are we to judge His actions? \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY We have free will and intelligence -- which God allegedly gave us.... \nAVI Anyway, God never lets Abraham kill Isaac. He provides the ram so that -- \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Personally, I think that's a lie. I think he did kill him. \nRAV ZINGESSER You think?! Based on what? \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY There's midrash supporting this. My father read a book by Shalom Spiegel that -- Isaac actually died and was reborn. \nRAV ZINGESSER No one follows that midrash. \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY I do; I follow it. But okay, say God provided the ram. So what? Once Abraham raised the knife, in his heart it was as if he'd killed him. He could never forget that. And neither could Isaac. Look at him: he's traumatized, he's a putz for the rest of his life. By the end he can't tell Jacob from Esau.... \nThe kids laugh. Zingesser CRACKS a ruler against a desk. \nRAV ZINGESSER Watch your language.... \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY (rising impassioned) I think the whole Jewish people were permanently scarred by what happened on Mt. Moriah, and we still live in terror.... \n12-YEAR-OLD STUART Fear of God is the beginning of wisdom. \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Fear of God makes you afraid of everything. All the Jews are good at is being afraid. And being sacrificed. \nOooo. CRACK, CRACK, CRACK. Even the guys with the sports pages are shocked by that one. \n12-YEAR-OLD STUART Don't you believe in God? \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY I'm the only one here who does believe. You say he's mysterious, yet merciful. I see him for the power- drunk madman He is. And we're supposed to worship such a Deity?? I say Never! I say...fight him. I say -- \nThe ruler has been CRACKING from \"power-drunk\" on.... Now Zingesser grabs Danny, yanks him out of his chair. \nRAV ZINGESSER Avi -- ask Rabbi Springer to come remove Danny from the class.... \nAvi rises, grinning, as...Danny struggles wildly to get free. \nRAV ZINGESSER And you, if you had come out of Egypt, you would have been destroyed in the desert with those who worshipped the Golden Calf. \n12-YEAR-OLD DANNY Then let Him destroy me now. Let Him crush me like the conceited bully He is. (to the ceiling) Go ahead. Kill me. Here I am. Do it!! \nThe class sits frozen in terror, waiting for God to kill Danny. But nothing happens. \nINT. YESHIVA STAIRWELL -- NIGHT \nHe HIGHLIGHTS the item about Curtis Zampf... \nEXT. VOMPADINK -- TWILIGHT \nA tough working-class Queens bar. \nINT. VOMPADINK -- TWILIGHT \nMen drink in clusters, including a group of skinheads.... Danny takes a place alone at the bar, drawing furtive attention from the regulars. When the BARTENDER finally comes over... \nDANNY Vodka tonic. \nA strange call for this place. As he waits, Danny turns and watches the skinheads enough to make them aware of him. \nThe girls watch him, too. The skins don't like that. One of them (Billings) seems ready to do something about it. The others try to calm him, and when they look back, Danny has left. He barely touched the drink. \nThe skins are puzzled, but one indicates his watch: time to go. They gather their stuff.... \nEXT. CITY/INT. 7 TRAIN -- EVENING \nLooking out the front of the train as it rushes toward Manhattan. A dramatic sky rises above the skyline. \nEXT. STREET -- NIGHT \nThe three skins -- O.L., CARLETON, BILLINGS -- walk up an East Side street. Billings is telling a story.... \nBILLINGS ...So she takes the pants in back -- where they try them on? And I think fuck it.... \nCARLETON Are you shitting me?? Right in the store? \nBILLINGS She's been giving me the eye. She's hot. So I wait till the owner goes up front.... \nDuring this, O.L. starts to SPRAY PAINT a crude SWASTIKA onto a BUS KIOSK. A VOICE startles them.... \nVOICE What are you doing?? \nThey jump, turn. Danny steps out of the shadows. \nDANNY (indicating swastika) What do you think you're doing? \nBILLINGS Who the fuck are you? \nDANNY (coming toward them) Who am I?? Who are you, you schmucks, you can't even make a decent swastika.... Give me the paint. (O.L. looks to his friends) Give it to me. \nDanny's will is stronger; O.L. hands over the spray can. Danny shakes it, critiques O.L.'s rendering.... \nDANNY (gruff but avuncular) It's too squared off. You got to orient it up and down, diamond-shaped, like this.... (sprays an excellent swastika) ...The arms go clockwise. (hands the can back) You're going to Curtis Zampf; me, too. Let's go? \nThey exchange looks: how did he know about Curtis? \nCURTIS ZAMPF (O.S.) ...Where I grew up in South Boston twenty years ago, when a kid walked down the street, everyone knew who he was... \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nGrand but threadbare. The skins enter: O.L. like a child, Carleton like a sardonic adolescent, Billings like a revolutionary, Danny like an uncrowned prince. \nCURTIS ZAMPF is addressing a dozen or so guests. He is 40 but appears younger; with rough good looks, longish hair and a leather jacket, he seems more like an aging rock star or sexy novelist that a standard-issue American Nazi. \nCURTIS ...If he ran out in front of a car, some old Mick'd yell at him, \"Jimmy Dunne, get back on that sidewalk and stay there....\" \nHe does the Boston Irish accent so well, everybody laughs. Up front we notice the only WOMAN in the room. She is in her 40s, regal, beautiful, forbidding. Her name is LINA MOEBIUS. \nCURTIS ...The day he graduated high school, he'd go see his uncle down at the gas works, or the priest's brother in the shipyard, get his apprentice papers, eight years later he'd be making $16.50 an hour, have four kids, play ball on Sundays in Columbus Park, and when he died, the whole town'd get drunk and cry over him.... \nThe crowd -- nonunion electricians, white taxi drivers, unemployed bookkeepers, failed academics, off-duty cops -- listens quietly. \nDuring this, a young woman (CARLA) appears from the rear of the apartment, heading for the kitchen with a coffee cup and a history book. She glances into the living room. \nCURTIS ...Today, when that kid walks down the street it's full of trash and half the faces are black. The shipyard's closed, all the jobs at the gas works are set-asides, and by the time he drops out of school, he can barely get a job at Burger King. So he drinks, smokes crack, and when he hangs himself on the front porch at twenty-three, the only people at his wake are a couple of buddies and his mother. The boy's father won't find out he's dead till six months later. (beat) The soul of this country is being destroyed, and all the government can offer is free trade, mutual funds and IPOs. \nGUY DANIELSEN You sound like a leftist. \nCURTIS I used to be one.... No, seriously, I called myself an anarchist. I stood up for the oppressed. I opposed state power. \nAN OLD COOT Don't you still? \nCURTIS I oppose the present state because it's weak. It has been ever since the left emasculated it over Vietnam. But I think the average man is crushed less by accumulated capital than the loss of community or real leadership, the personal emptiness he simply cannot fill on his own.... (matter-of-fact) That's why I'm a fascist. It's the only form of government that addresses our deepest needs. \nDANNY ...Leona Helmsley, Michael Eisner, Bob Dylan, Phillip Roth, Ruth Bader Ginsberg, Steven Spielberg, Winona Ryder, Beverly Sills, Alvin Toffler, Katherine Graham. All of them. But not yet. We don't want celebrity obscuring the issue. \nCARLA Which is what? \nDANNY At first, no one will know why the victims are being killed. \nCURTIS You wouldn't announce it? \nDANNY I'd say nothing. After two or three, people will try to find a pattern. A reason. \nCURTIS But when it comes out, the public will be outraged. It will look like Germany all over again. \nDANNY Isn't that what we want? Germany all over again? Only done right this time... \nThe crowd feels a deep atavistic thrill. Zampf glances at Mrs. Moebius.... \nDANNY Without speeches or political parties. A movement without leaders so that no one can stop it... \nThe room is stunned to silence. Mrs. Moebius signals Curtis. \nCURTIS Okay, let's break this up for now.... (to Danny) Could you wait a minute...? \nINT. SAME -- FIVE MINUTES LATER \nDanny -- flushed with triumph -- stands looking down at the city. \nACROSS THE ROOM -- MRS. MOEBIUS & CURTIS ZAMPF \nCURTIS (low) ...I thought we agreed, no anti- Semitism...it's exactly what we're trying to put behind us.... Trash the blacks, fine; but... \nMRS. MOEBIUS Did you see how they reacted to him? \nCURTIS Yes, of course. But that only plays in this room, with people who aren't embarrassed to call themselves Nazis. If you want a modern fascism, you don't mention Jews. \nMRS. MOEBIUS It's a romantic movement, Curtis. It always has been. \nCURTIS Lina, the Thousand-Year Reich barely lasted a decade.... Do you really want to go down that road again? In America of all places, where obedience and discipline are not exactly the national virtues... \nShe looks over at Danny, now chatting with Carla.... \nLINA He's very bright. \nCURTIS He speaks well. But what do we do with him? \nLINA Let's find out who he is. \nCURTIS You mean who he really is. \nON DANNY & CARLA \nCARLA You're not in school? What do you do? \nDANNY I work at the Big Boy warehouse. In Queens. I drive a fork-lift. \nCARLA Where'd you read all that stuff? \nDANNY I just read it.... \nLINA Young man... \nHe turns. She's beckoning to him. He gives Carla a look, then crosses to her, sitting in a chair she indicates. Curtis offers him a drink; he declines. Carla takes one. \nLINA Lina Moebius. And you are...? \nDANNY Daniel Balint. \nLINA Balint? \nDANNY It's German. \nLINA (IN GERMAN) What part of Germany are you people from? \nDANNY (IN GERMAN) From the Rhineland originally. \nLINA (IN ENGLISH) Are you with the FBI, Mr. Balint?... Or any other law enforcement agency? \nDANNY I was going to ask you the same thing. \nA Mercedes pulls up, Carla driving. The skins climb out, Carleton guiding O.L., who cannot see. \nCARLA He should go to a hospital. \nO.L. I'm okay. \nBillings turns back, sees Danny still in the car. \nBILLINGS You coming? \nDANNY (glances at Carla, stays in the car) We'll go to the country sometime, okay? \nBillings nods grudgingly. The car drives off. Carleton grins. \nCARLETON Fucking Danny, man... \nBILLINGS He's an asshole. \nINT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT -- TWILIGHT \nCarla leads Danny through the darkened apartment. \nINT. CARLA'S ROOM -- TWILIGHT \nAn old bookcase full of leather-bound German volumes...Danny opens one marked Hofmannsthal. He tries to read a marked passage. \nDANNY \"...und die Worte zerfielen mir im Munde wie modrige Pilze...\" \nCARLA \"And the words fell apart in my mouth like moldering mushrooms...\" \nDANNY How come so many of the books are in Spanish? \nCARLA They're my father's. He's from Argentina. My mother's family went there during the war. That's where they met. \nDANNY Are they still together? \nCARLA He's in a mental institution.... He's been there for ten years, off and on. Mostly on. \nDANNY Is he a Nazi? \nCARLA I guess. His parents are. He doesn't care about that. \nDANNY What's he care about? \nCARLA Killing himself. \nThey look at each other. There's that gulf between them that they have to cross, but they're not sure how. \nDANNY You think people ever commit suicide out of happiness? \nCARLA That's stupid. Why would they? \nHe shrugs. She takes his hand, rubs the bruised knuckles. \nCARLA You're not like the others, are you?... Your friends. \nDANNY Yes, I am. Basically I am. \nShe leans close, whispers.... \nCARLA Hurt me. \nHe's surprised, but not very. He grabs her wrist, twists it. \nCARLA Ow! That's too hard. \nHe pulls her out of frame. She starts to say something, but it's cut off by another CRY OF PAIN. We keep looking out the window.... \nINT. SAME -- LATER \nThe light has shifted across the city, and we hear only a muffled sobbing. \nThe CAMERA TURNS to look at...Carla and Danny naked on the bed. He lies back, reading the German book. She's curled on her side, weeping abjectly. Still sobbing, she rolls over, buries her face in his chest. We see that his neck is scratched up. \nCARLA Do it again.... \nShe begins to fondle him. He ignores it until he finishes the poem, then turns to her. \nGUY (laughing, embarrassed) What's that go to do with...I've gone out with a, with Jewish women. Why? \nDANNY And? WHat did you notice? \nGUY Notice? Like what...? \nDANNY Jewish girls like to give head, right? \nGUY I don't know. Is that right? \nDANNY And Jewish men like to get it. \nGUY Everybody likes to, don't they? \nDANNY Yes. It's very pleasurable. But the Jews are obsessed with it. You know why? \nGUY Why? \nDANNY Because the Jew is essentially female. \nGUY Female... \nDANNY Real men -- white, Christian men -- we fuck a woman. We make her come with our cocks. But the Jew doesn't like to penetrate and thrust -- he can't assert himself that directly -- so he resorts to perversions. Oral sex is technically a perversion, you know that, don't you? (as Guy nods) After a woman has been with a Jewish man, she never wants a normal partner again. A normal man. \nGUY Does that mean the Jew is the better lover? \nDANNY You're not listening. He isn't better. He gives pleasure, but that's actually a weakness. \nGUY Danny, what makes you think you know all this? \nDANNY Let's just say I've done due diligence. \nGUY So, fine, it's not that the Jew, the Jews own the media and the banks. It's that they're sexually corrupt. \nDANNY The Jews clearly control the media and the banks. Investment banks, not the commercial ones. But the point is they carry out in those realms the same principles they display in sexuality. They undermine traditional life; they deracinate society. \nDanny leans over to make sure Guy's getting it right. \nDANNY Deracinate... Tear out the roots. A people -- a real people -- derives its genius from the land: the sun, the sea, the soil. This is how they know themselves. But the Jew doesn't have soil. \nGUY He has Israel. \nDANNY Those aren't Jews. \nGUY Of course they're Jews. \nDANNY Notice the Israelis: a fundamentally secular society. They no longer need Judaism because they have soil. The real Jew is a wanderer, a nomad. He has no roots, no attachments. So he \"universalizes\" everything. He can't hammer a nail, plow a field. He can only buy and sell, invest capital, manipulate markets. He takes the life of a people rooted in soil and turns it into a cosmopolitan culture based on books, ideas, numbers. This is his strength.... (pumped; this is what he loves) Take the great Jewish minds: Marx, Freud, Einstein. What have they given us: communism, infantile sexuality and the atom bomb. In a mere three centuries since these guys emerged from the ghettos of Europe, they've taken us from a world built on order and reason and hurled us into a chaos of class warfare, irrational urges and relativity, a world where the very existence of matter and meaning is in doubt. Why? Because it is the deepest impulse of the Jewish soul to unravel the very fabric of life until nothing is left but thread, nothing but nothingness. Nothingness without end... \nGUY Are all Jews the same? \nDANNY Differences exist, of course, but they're irrelevant. For the Jew, his Jewishness dominates everything. Even the ones who renounce it, who hate it, who want to cut it out of their hearts a knife...can't escape. They're still just Jews. \nGuy finishes writing that and looks up. \nGUY Danny, this is great. You're incredibly articulate. One more thing... How can you believe this when you're a Jew yourself? \nA beat. Danny smiles at the mistake.... \nDANNY What? Excuse me?... (Guy says nothing) You're kidding, right? \nGUY Do you know Rabbi Stanley Nadelman? He used to be at Congregation Beth Elohim in Ozone Park...? \nDANNY Who? How would I know him? \nGUY He says you were bar mitzvahed there, in March 1988. \nDANNY You believe that? And you call yourself a reporter? \nGUY So you're saying it's not true. \nDANNY Look at me.  DO I look Jewish?  Look... \nHe indicates his hair, turns sideways to show his profile? \nGUY Were you ever bar mitzvahed anywhere else? \nDANNY Do you know who you're fucking with here? \nHe stumbles backward. The others crowd around, keep him from falling, also from getting away. Billings starts to help, but people grab him: this is Danny's problem. \nSteroid comes at him.... Danny steps inside the charge and goes to work on the bigger man's body. We barely see what happens, but we hear it and feel the crowd's shock. Danny is stronger than we realized and much more vicious. In seconds, Steroid sinks to his knees, face bloody. Danny holds up him, leans close: \nDANNY Enough? \nSteroid mumbles in the affirmative. Danny nods -- then hits him four more shots to the face. Even this crowd winces. Steroid drops with a wet thud. \nAs Danny straightens up, wiping the blood off his hands, people instinctively step back. \nDANNY Which was his room? \nKYLE (ferrety, glasses) Number ten. \nOn the end: has an extra window. Danny walks into the room. Steroid's stuff starts flying out the door. \nEXT. MOTEL PORCH -- NIGHT \nDanny on a pay phone. \nDANNY Yeah, I'm trying to reach Carla, is she?... Did she get my other message?... No, I'll call back.... \nEXT. MOTEL PORCH -- NIGHT \nDanny hangs up the phone, glances into a room where we dimly glimpse Nazis taking drugs, drinking beer, screaming... \nVARIOUS VOICES Fucking niggers... Fucking niggers? Fucking gooks!... \nThen incomprehensible shrieking rage, a fight, breaking glass... \nDanny sighs, bored. He spots two nerdy Nazis, KYLE and WHIT, playing some battle re-creation board game and rehashing WWII.... \nWHIT ...Look, if Hitler had knocked out the RAF in '39, which he could easily, easily have done, he'd have taken England, and the U.S. wouldn't have had -- \nKYLE ...A staging ground for the invasion, yeah. But he blew it going after civilian targets. Just like he blew the Russian front, diverting supplies to Auschwitz.... \nDanny looks up the hill toward a farmhouse perched above them. One light burns inside. \nDANNY Where's Mrs. Moebius? \nKYLE Her place is down the road. But she just comes out for weekends sometimes. \nDanny squats to look at the board game. \nDANNY What is this, Stalingrad? \nWHIT Gettysburg. But we're refighting it with World War I technology. It's a fucking bloodbath. \nHe grins maniacally. Danny smiles. Kyle is emboldened by Danny's unexpected friendliness, lowers his voice.... \nKYLE That was unbelievable what you did to Lucas. The guy's an animal. \nDANNY You could do it. \nKYLE Get out of here.... \nDANNY You look right through him. He's there, but there's something on the other side of him that you want. It's all you want. And whatever's in the way doesn't matter.... Then it's easy. \nAs Kyle and Whit contemplate his wisdom... \nDANNY Either of you know anything about explosives? \nThey both look up, very interested. \nTWO FAMILIES IN TABLEAU -- WOODEN CUTOUTS -- DAY \nJews: MAN (black hat, beard), WOMAN (sheitl, shawl), BOY (kippah, twerpy), GIRL (fat, ugly), even a DOG, a Star of David on its side. \nBlacks: MAN (watermelon, pitchfork), WOMAN (fat, fried chicken), BOY (syringe, 9mm), GIRL (twins, welfare check), DOG (black). \nVOICE (O.S.) Take a breath, let out a little, relax, then squeeze. (a RIFLE SHOT; nothing's hit) Again... \nAnother SHOT. A bullet hits the Jewish boy in the rear end. Sunlight streams through the hole. We are: \nEXT. REAR OF MOTEL -- DAY \nDanny peers down the barrel of an M-16. Kyle squats beside him. \nThe Waiter ignores the innuendo, readies his order pad. \nBILLINGS Ham and cheese on white. \nFIRST WAITER (forbearance) We don't have ham. We don't have cheese. \nBILLINGS What the hell do you have? \nFIRST WAITER That's what the menus are for. \nHe smiles. Billings glares. \nO.L. Roast beef and Swiss. \nFIRST WAITER I said: no cheese. \nO.L. What's wrong with cheese? \nFIRST WAITER This is a kosher restaurant. We don't serve meat with dairy. \nDANNY What about chicken? \nFIRST WAITER That's meat. \nDANNY The Bible only says don't seethe a kid in its mother's milk. But chickens don't give milk. \nFIRST WAITER Look, you want cheese, go someplace else. \nDANNY But it's stupid, right? You admit it's stupid. \nFIRST WAITER No, I don't admit it's stupid. \nDANNY You can have chicken with eggs but not with milk. Why is that? \nFIRST WAITER I'm not here to talk about religious law, if you don't like -- \nDANNY But you already talked about it: you said it's not stupid. Why isn't it stupid? \nFIRST WAITER (calling the other Waiter) Steve... \nDANNY Steve's going to explain it. \nSteve approaches, a sawed-off broom handle over his shoulders. \nSTEVE We have a problem here? \nBILLINGS We sure fucking do. We don't understand why you can't eat chicken with milk. It doesn't make sense. \nSTEVE (an intellectual) Religion isn't about making sense. It's about -- \nDANNY It's about the incomprehensible, Steve, not the idiotic. \nSTEVE Fuck you. \nDANNY That explains it! Now we understand! \nThe Nazis laugh. Steve swings the broom handle at Danny...who ducks it, grabs it, slams it back at him.... GAVEL RAPS... \nINT. COURTROOM -- DAY \nA JUDGE (white-haired, red-faced, blue-eyed, well-meaning) peers down at the four NAZIS, still bruised from the fight. \nJUDGE ...As the altercation appears to have been instigated equally on both sides, prison terms strike the court as excessive. \nThe Nazis are relieved. Spectators disappointed. \nJUDGE However, the defendants' political views suggest that they might profit from contact with members of our community whose experiences differ from their own.... \nINT. A SOCIAL ROOM -- DAY \nNUMBERS TATTOOED ON AN ARM...a thumb steadily smooths the skin as: \nRUMANIAN WOMAN (O.S.) (Rumanian accent, uninflected) ...When I refused to have sex with him, the warden had my sister, Esther, executed in front of the entire block.... \nThe Nazis, accompanied by a \"HATE COUNSELOR\" (male) sit in plastic chairs opposite five elderly JEWS. The speaker is in her late 60s, still something of a beauty. \nRUMANIAN WOMAN ...Everyone considered it my fault. After that, of course, I did anything he wanted. \nDANNY (disgusted with this idiocy) Oh, please... \nBILLINGS Danny, it's true. There were no six million. At most, two hundred thousand Jews died in the camps. And the majority of them were from disease and -- \nThe Jews are shouting about historical records, the disappearance of families, whole towns.... But Danny is louder: \nDANNY Where did you read this? Robert Faurisson? \nBILLINGS (surprised he knew) Yeah. He's a respected scholar. Even No-am Chomsky says he -- \nDANNY Billings, if Hitler didn't kill six million, why is he your hero?... Concentration camps all over Europe, and he only gets rid of a measly two hundred thousand.... He's a putz. \nSome surprise that a Nazi is arguing against a denier. \nANCIENT JEW Hitler was not a putz. Hitler was real. God created him to punish the Jews for abandoning God. \nThe other survivors are embarrassed by this, but the Ancient Jew ignores them. \nANCIENT JEW It is you who are putzes. Little pishas with your dreams of hatred and killing... \nDanny scoffs, gets up to leave. \nHATE COUNSELOR Where do you think you're going? \nDANNY ...We have nothing to learn from these people. They should learn from us. \nAs Danny walks out, the Ancient Jew catches his eye. \nANCIENT And what should we learn from you, Daniel? \nHer use of Danny's name feels knowing, slyly invasive. All SOUND VANISHES for a beat, and Danny barely manages to say: \nDANNY Kill your enemy. \nEXT. MOTEL -- DAY \nKyle opens the trunk of his car, shows Danny inside: two bags of shotgun powder and several lengths of metal piping with screw-on caps. \nDANNY What is it? \nKYLE Green dot -- shotgun powder. For pipe bombs. (off Danny's reaction, smiles) A guy in a lumberyard gave it to me. A donation to the cause. \nCARLETON (O.S.) Hey, Danny.... Guess who's here.... (as Danny quickly slams the trunk) Your girlfriend... She's up at the house. \nEXT. THE FARMHOUSE -- DAY \nIn the driveway: Carla's Mercedes, a Triumph motorcycle. Danny peers in through the windows, goes to the door. \nINT. FARMHOUSE, LIVING ROOM -- DAY \nDanny sees Carla sitting on a green sofa wearing a white sundress and leafing through a magazine. Curtis is mixing drinks. Lina is practicing with her stylus on a new electronic organizer. \nLINA My L's keep coming out as C's.... \nCURTIS (spots Danny) The prisoner returns.... \nDanny greets them all. Carla barely looks up. \nLINA Danny, get a drink and come talk to me. \nINT. LIVING ROOM -- A FEW MINUTES LATER \nDanny talking with Lina and Curtis but watching Carla. \nCURTIS ...Insulting people who were in the camps. ...What's the point? \nDANNY They're liars and cowards. \nCURTIS I'm sure they are. But what do we accomplish by pointing it out? \nDANNY It's the truth.... \nCurtis rolls his eyes. Lina signals him to lay off. \nLINA MOEBIUS Danny, what do you think of our troops? \nDANNY (trying to be diplomatic) They have guts. And they know what they hate...which is good. But they have no idea why; they don't think, they don't read.... They're on beer and crank half the time.... \nStraightening up, Danny is stunned by a vision: \nTHE OPEN ARK -- THE TORAHS \n...their silver crowns and breastplates, velvet robes. And Steroid Excess, lifting one out. Danny reacts with an instinctive horror. \nDANNY What are you doing? Put that down! ...Put it back in there. \nSteroid -- cowed by Danny -- starts to obey, but before he can... \nBILLINGS What do you care? \nDANNY I don't, but... \nBILLINGS (vaults onto the stage) Let's look at the fucking thing. \nEach CURSE makes Danny wince, but he just hovers about nervously as Billings and Steroid try to unwrap the Torah while others gather, some comically wrapping themselves in tallises. \nDANNY Put it there, on the... \nHe indicates the bema, stepping back as if to deny any involvement, yet at the same time trying to monitor everything they do. \nDANNY (indicating crowns, the yod...) Just be careful with the... \nO.L. (puts a crown on his head) \"If I were king of the forest...not Prince, not Duke, not Earl...\" \nDanny cannot endure this desecration, but everyone else laughs, so he keeps his mouth shut. \nKYLE Open it up. \nDANNY (impulsively taking over) Here... \nHe shoves his way in and, gripping the handles, unrolls the Torah. Low MURMURS at the sight of the broad columns, the mysterious calligraphy, the CRACKLING parchment. Danny himself is struck by the sudden immediacy of the sacred text. OVER this... \nVOICES Oooo... Weird... You read it from right to left.... The letters look like squashed bugs.... What kind of paper is that? \nDANNY It's not paper, it's parchment. It's made from sheepskin. And all the letters are drawn by hand. \nKYLE Neat calligraphy. \nDanny nods, then, as if against his will.... \nDANNY It's called the flame alphabet. It's supposed to be the word of God written in fire. \nBILLINGS Fire... \nDANNY The mystics tried to read the white spaces around the letters. They thought there was a whole alternative language hidden there, with secret, alternative meanings. \nKYLE Cool. \nDanny sees Drake watching him, smirks to express his disgust. \nBILLINGS How come you know all this shit? \nDANNY How come you don't know it? (pressing the advantage) How can you say you hate the Jews when you don't know anything about -- \nBILLINGS Fuck you. I hate the Jews at least as much as you do. \nDANNY No, you don't.... If you hated them, you'd study them, so you'd know why you hate them. You know what tefillin is? Tsitsis? Shotness? You know the kaddish from the kiddush? (obviously not) Eichmann? He went to Israel. He studied the Torah, the Talmud, the Mishnah, the whole bit. He hated Jews. \nCARLETON Who's Eichmann? \nDANNY Who's Eichmann?!!? \nDanny's incredulous, though it's not clear how many of the others know why Eichmann was. \nKYLE He was head of the Gestapo's Jewish sector. He deported people to the camps. \nCARLETON (reaching toward the parchment) Can we touch it? \nDANNY Yeah, but not on the letters. \nBILLINGS Why the fuck not? \nDANNY (warning finger) Just don't. \nBillings bristles at Danny's authority; Carleton says to him... \nRABBI (ON TV) The purest form of spirit... \nON DANNY. Sound fades. He's haunted: \"Nothingness without end\" was what he'd told Guy Danielsen the Jews were obsessed with. He seems to hear the cello playing \"Kol Nidre\" again. Then... \nDANNY Okay, everybody out. Get out. \nHe switches off the TV. Shoves them out the door, slams it. \nINT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- LATER \nAlone he sits at the desk, finds himself gazing at the Torah, standing in a corner of his closet, draped in the tallis. \nHe slams the closet door, it bounces open. Slams it again, making sure it latches. \nHe sits down, looks at the closed door until, in bitter resignation he gets up and opens it again. \nHe unrolls the Torah on the bed...Scotch tapes the tear closed...attempts to clean the stain with a moistened cloth. \nINT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- DAY \nDanny is in the bathroom in front of the mirror, holding his shirt up with his chin as he wraps the tallis around his torso. When he lowers the shirt, the fringes hang out like the tsitsis that Orthodox men wear. \nHe feels a weird loathing for this, but he smooths and arranges the tsitsis to look just like a Hasid's. He clicks his heels together and gives a Nazi salute. \nDANNY Alenu l'shab'ach la'adon hacol... \nAnother Nazi salute. A KNOCK at the door. He hides the fringes under the shirt, throws a blanket over the Torah. \nDANNY What? \nSTEROID (O.S.) Phone, Danny. \nEXT. MOTEL -- PAY PHONE -- DAY \nGUY'S VOICE (PHONE) Danny Balint...Guy Danielsen, New York Times. \nDANNY (tucks in the tallis fringes) What do you want? What happened to your article? \nGUY'S VOICE (PHONE) I couldn't get my editor to run it, but I bet he will now that you've put a bomb in a synagogue. That was you, wasn't it, Danny? \nDanny hangs up. Stands there. A VOICE makes him jump.... \nVOICE (DRAKE) Hey, Danny, want to kill a Jew? \nDanny turns: it's Drake. These are the first words he's spoken. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET/INT. CAR -- DAY \nDanny and Drake pass a low-slung modern synagogue. A sign announces: AMBASSADOR ILIO MANZETTI Friday, August 31. Danny reacts, startled...Drake smiles. \nDRAKE Park up there, we'll walk back. \nEXT. CONGREGATION BETH SHALOM -- TWILIGHT \nThe building is lit. Within we hear an AMPLIFIED VOICE, presumably Manzetti giving a speech. We can't make out the words. Danny and Drake are hidden among the rhododendrons flanking the parking lot. Danny is watching a door in the side of the building and eating a sandwich as Drake loads a scoped rifle. \nDRAKE Lie on your stomach and come up on your elbows. \nDANNY Why me? \nDRAKE You want to kill a Jew. I already did. \nDanny assumes the prone position, Drake sets the rifle in his hands. \nDANNY Who'd you kill? \nDRAKE Four. But no one this important. \nWe hear APPLAUSE within as the speech ends. \nDRAKE Okay, it's over. He'll take a couple questions, then come out.... Sight down the rifle toward the door. \nTHROUGH RIFLE SCOPE: Danny pans from the side door -- where TWO MEN are smoking -- to a waiting limousine. \nDANNY How did you know they were Jews? \nDRAKE I can tell.... \nMRS. MOEBIUS We think you'd be good at it. \nOFF-SCREEN we hear the front door. FEET come up the stairs.... \nDANNY What about...Manzetti, the synagogues.... \nCURTIS That doesn't seem to be happening, does it? \nDANNY I've been stuck out in the country with those guys who just want to paint swastikas and heil Hitler. How am I supposed to -- (get anything done there?) \nHe stops short as Carla walks into the room for shopping. She glances at them, puts down her bags, goes into the kitchen.... \nCURTIS Danny, the night we met, you said the name Ilio Manzetti. We were impressed. We were excited. But here it is September, and Mr. Manzetti is still walking around breathing the air. \nMRS. MOEBIUS We need intellectuals, we have enough thugs already. \nDanny's watching Carla go down the hall toward the back, can barely bring his attention back to the conversation at hand. \nDANNY I'm not an intellectual.... I mean, I read, but... Fund-raising isn't what I... \nMRS. MOEBIUS Look, if you want to kill Jews on your free time, fine. We need you to raise money. Will you do that for us? \nHe nods but cannot look at her. \nMRS. MOEBIUS Thank you. \nHe's dismissed. He rises. \nMRS. MOEBIUS Do you have a suit? (off Danny; to Curtis) Let's get him one.... And a cell phone too. (as Danny turns to go; a joke for her own amusement) And if you insist on blowing up a synagogue, make it that big one on Fifth Avenue, would you? \nDANNY Beth Shalom? It's Reform. \nMRS. MOEBIUS So what? \nDANNY They're not that Jewish. \nMRS. MOEBIUS I don't care what they are. I know those people, and I don't like them. The rest are just a bunch of kikes, aren't they? \nShe smiles. He manages a smile back and hurries away, face burning with shame. \nEXT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT, STREET -- NIGHT \nDanny comes out of the building, squats between two parked cars and vomits, retching spastically until, gasping for breath... \nVOICE Here... \nHe turns. Carla walks over to him, wipes his mouth with a crumpled tissue. When she moves to kiss him, he holds back, shy about the smell, but she kisses him anyway, on the mouth. \nINT. DANNY'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nCarla, naked, browsing the books, sees something in the closet. It's the Torah Danny took from the synagogue. She unrolls it on the bed, her gaze moving over the mysterious, glossy script. Danny, coming out of the bathroom, sees what she is doing, and stops short. \nCARLA Where'd you get this? \nDANNY I stole it. From a synagogue. \nShe looks at the broad printed columns.... \nCARLA How come there's no punctuation? \nDANNY That was a later invention, it's not in the scrolls.... Anyway, the Jews know where the sentences end. They know the whole thing by heart. Every word. Every letter. \nCARLA Do you know it like that? By heart. \nDANNY No. \nCARLA But you can read it, the Hebrew.... Right? \nDANNY What do you care? \nCARLA 'Cause I want to know.... What is this word? This one here... \nDanny looks at the word, then back at her. He's torn between competing desires, but finally... \nDANNY Va-yomer... And he said. (she moves her finger to the left) It goes the other way. \nCARLA (she knew that) Oh, yeah... (moves finger right) \nINT. SAME -- ANOTHER DAY \nSlightly bigger crowd, a few middle-class-looking people. \nDANNY ...Because they're tight with money, or because they flash it around? Because they're Bolsheviks or because they're capitalists? Because they have the highest IQs, or because they have the most active sex lives? \nThe audience, confused... \nDANNY Do you want to know the real reason we hate them?... \nINT. SAME -- DAY \n...More people: white collar workers of both sexes, nurses, artists. Lapel buttons, bumper stickers, backpacks: \"FIGHT NEW WORLD DISORDER\" \"STOP THE WTO\" \"EARTH FIRST!\" \nDANNY ...Because we hate them. (as people exchange puzzled looks) Because they exist. Because it is an axiom of civilization that just as man longs for woman, loves his children and fears death, he hates the Jews. (smiles) There is no reason. If there were, some smart-ass kike would give us an argument, try to prove we were wrong. And of course that would only make us hate them more. In fact we have all the reasons we need in three simple letters: J-E-W. Jew. Say it a million times. It is the only word that never loses its meaning: Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew Jew.... \nEXT. NEW JERSEY MEADOWLANDS -- DAWN \nDanny and Kyle sitting in the tall grass across the marshlands toward the Manhattan skyline shimmering in the distance. \nKYLE (sings, looking at watch) \"My country 'tis of thee, Sweet land of liberty, Of thee I...\" \nHe points sharply and an explosion occurs thirty yards away. They run over, pick up the mangled timer. They're pleased. \nEXT. JCC (ANSCHE CHESED) -- DAY \nA couple of stragglers hurry through the door as we hear... \nVOICES B'Rosh Hashanah yika-teyvun, uv'yom tsom kippur yey-chateymun... \nINT. SMALL CHAPEL -- DAY \nRosh Hashanah services. A woman is davening.... \nWOMAN And it came to pass after these things that God tested Abraham... \nDANNY...sitting with Stuart and Miriam... \nWOMAN (O.S.) ...And said to him, \"Abraham.\" And he said, \"Here am I...\" And God said, \"Take your son, your only son, whom you love...\" \nDANNY (to himself) It's not his only son.... \nANOTHER VOICE The only one he loves. \nDanny looks at AVI (athletic, smooth-shaven) who grins sardonically and fakes a punch as... \nDANNY They only kill them when they love them? \nAVI (sliding into a seat next to them) What are you doing here, I thought you were a Nazi. \nSTUART Come on, Avi... \nAVI You know what this guy told me once: Islam and Judaism both start with Abraham murdering his son: first sending Ishmael into the desert, then sacrificing Isaac.... \nVOICES Shhhh... Can you please be quiet? \nDANNY And Christianity's the same, with minor variations. \nAVI Ridiculous. (to the people around them) Folks, don't listen to this guy. He's a well-known anti-Semite. \nMIRIAM Avi, please... \nAVI (snatching off Danny's hat) ...Look, he's a skinhead. \nVOICES It's just a style, Avi.... There are antiracist skins. \nAVI (laughing) Believe me, Danny's the racist kind. Are you a fascist, Danny? Yes or no. \nDANNY What's a fascist? \nAVI I rest my case. He's a Jewish Nazi. He always was. \nDANNY Whereas Avi's a Zionist Nazi. \nAVI The Zionists aren't Nazis. \nDANNY They're racist, they're militaristic, they act like bullyboys in the territories.... \nDANNY About doing things. You light candles, say prayers, keep the Sabbath, visit the sick.... \nCARLA And belief follows? \nDANNY No. Nothing follows. You don't do it because it's smart or stupid or it saves your soul. You're not saved. Nobody's saved. You do it because the Torah tells you do. You submit to the Torah. \nCARLA Fuck that. \nDANNY Don't curse in front of it. \nCARLA (flips the book closed) Why should I submit? \nDANNY You shouldn't. \nCARLA You think I should just because there's no reason? \nHe looks at her without answering. \nDANNY No, I think you shouldn't. \nCARLA Judaism doesn't even need God. You have the Torah, the law. That's your fucking God.... (anticipating his objections) The book's closed. \nIn an access of something, she bites his arm, hard. He winces, pushes her away. She kisses the place she bit. He starts to play with her hair.... \nDANNY You're learning the Hebrew really fast. \nCARLA I told you, I'm good at this. \nDANNY Plus you have nothing else to do all day. \nCARLA Oh, am I learning it faster than you did? Maybe I'm smarter. \nHe laughs, likes her arrogance. But she misunderstands: \nCARLA Is that funny? You think Jews are the only smart ones? \nAs they make out, grow aroused... \nDANNY What...? You think I'm Jewish? \nCARLA It's all you talk about. Jewish, Jewish, Jewish. Nobody talks about it that much except the Jews. \nDanny's taken aback by the simple logic. \nDANNY Nazis talk about it all the time. \nCARLA Do they? \nAnd, of course, she has grown up among Nazis. \nDANNY The real Nazis. Hitler, Goebbels, they talked about Jews incessantly.... You ever read their diaries?... \nCARLA Is that why you became a Nazi? So you could talk about Jews incessantly? \nDANNY Believe me, Adolf Hitler couldn't possibly have hated the Jews as much as I do. Not in a billion years. You know why? \nCARLA 'Cause he wasn't a rabbi. \nDANNY You want a punch in the mouth? \nCARLA Okay... (he doesn't hit her) Why don't we light candles on Friday? Let's light candles.... And say the kaddish. \nDANNY Kaddish is the prayer for the dead. \nCARLA I mean kiddush. Let's say kiddush. And shave my head, fuck through a sheet, all that stuff... (as he walks away) Come on, just for fun. To see what it's like... \nINT. SMALL LECTURE HALL -- NIGHT \nPacked with a well-dressed crowd, very different from the crowds we've seen here before. \nDOWN IN FRONT: Mrs. Moebius and Danny talk in low tones. \nMRS. MOEBIUS Half the right-wing money in New York is here tonight. They came to see you. If you impress them, if you do what I know you can, this movement will be up and running by tomorrow. And on the front page of the New York Times in six months. \nShe straightens his tie, directs him toward the lectern. He hesitates.... \nDANNY We tested the new bomb. \nMrs. Moebius impatiently signals him to silence. \nREPORTER (O.S.) ...Paramedics arrived within ninety seconds, but Mr. Manzetti was declared dead at the scene. \nAt the mention of Manzetti's name, Danny goes white. \nANCHOR'S VOICE Ilio Manzetti was one of the respected and influential men in New York. As an investment banker, diplomat, adviser to presidents and mayors, he helped shape public policy and private finance for more than three decades. He'll be missed, Phil. This is Michael Port with New York 1. \nDanny's knees are weak, his hands cold, his stomach rises.... He becomes aware of the others, staring at him in amazement. \nDANNY (stunned) Do you think I... \nMRS. MOEBIUS Danny, please, we don't want to know. \nShe and Curtis walk out of the room. Stunned, shaken, Danny leaves in a different direction. The TV plays to an empty room... \nANCHOR'S VOICE The assailant is described as a white male in his late 20s.... \nEXT. MOEBIUS BUILDING/STREET -- DAY \nDanny wanders out the door in a daze. His cell phone RINGING. He has to search his pockets, then fumbles to turn it on.... \nKYLE'S VOICE (PHONE) You finally killed a Jew, man. How's it feel? \nDANNY Kyle...I can't talk right now.... \nHe hears a CAMERA SHUTTER and MOTOR DRIVE. He turns.... \nEXT. ACROSS THE STREET -- DAY \nGUY DANIELSEN & A PHOTOGRAPHER. \nThey're coming toward him. \nGUY Did you kill Ilio Manzetti? \nDANNY No. \nSuddenly Danny runs after the photographer, they struggle.... \nPHOTOGRAPHER Not the camera, don't hurt the camera... \nDanny opens the camera, rips out the film, exposing it. \nGUY Did you kill him? \nDanny glares at him without answering, walks away. Guy hurries after him.... \nGUY Two days ago you addressed a Nazi rally. Last week you went to a Torah study group. \nDANNY What were you, following me? \nGUY How do you reconcile the two? \nDANNY I don't. Look, stay out of what you don't understand. \nGUY Explain it so I can. \nDANNY You work for the New York Times. Your whole job in life is not to understand things like me. \nGUY I don't think you know what you are. \nDANNY (walking on, fast) Yeah, and what are you? A Times man? A Presbyterian? Impotent? A prick? \nGUY Who killed Manzetti? \nDANNY If I tell you, will you pull the story? Not write about me? \nGUY It's too late.... If I didn't, somebody else would. (as Danny just snorts) Yom Kippur starts at sundown. Will you go to synagogue? \nDANNY (turns on him, threatening) Get the fuck away from me. \nGuy backs off. Danny crosses the street. \nVOICE Hey, Danny, just one more! \nHe glances back. It's the PHOTOGRAPHER who has reloaded and now SNAPS a shot AS DANNY TURNS AWAY and keeps going.... \nDANNY A woman of valor, who can find her? Her price is above rubies.... \nHe walks out, leaving the door open. Carla starts to call after him, but then doesn't. She turns back, lights the candles and awkwardly reads the prayers.... \nEXT. STREET/PAY PHONE -- SUNDOWN APPROACHING \nDanny on a phone. Behind him, Jews hurry home for the holiday. He hears a BEEP... \nDANNY Miriam, it's me, Danny.... Come on, the holiday hasn't started, pick up the -- (as someone does) ...Is Stuart davening Ne'ilah tomorrow at the minyan... 'Cause he always does... Tell him I'm doing it instead.... \nShe argues (we hear her VOICE not her words)...Danny cuts her off. \nDANNY Miriam, I'm davening.... He gives me any trouble, I'll beat the shit out of him right there in the room. I'm serious.... \nShe's still talking when he hangs up and walks away. \nINT. MOEBIUS APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nLina and Curtis with Billings and Drake, who looks bad... \nLINA Why didn't you tell us? \nDRAKE (never considered it) I was hurt. I just... \nBILLINGS He went to his friends' place and I laid up there 'til he was better. Then he called me. \nCURTIS You should've gone to the police. \nLINA I don't think Drake wants to talk to the police. Do you? \nDRAKE I'll take care of him myself. \nThe phone RINGS. Curtis answers, listens, covers the mouthpiece. \nCURTIS Daniel Balint. \nShe takes it with a dramatic gesture. \nLINA (takes the phone) Hello...? \nINTERCUT WITH: \nEXT. PAY PHONE, 65TH STREET -- NIGHT \nDANNY Lina... It's happening. Tonight. \nLINA What is happening? \nDANNY Beth Shalom. Like you wanted. \nLINA Beth Shalom? What are you talking about? Who is this...? \nDANNY Lina, you said if I was going to plant a bomb, I should -- \nA CLICK as she hangs up. He's pleased. He steps away from the phone. He's carrying a grease-stained bag and is across from... \nTEMPLE EMANU-EL...KOL NIDRE being sung by a soprano within; and ORGAN accompanying her. \nEXT. 5TH AVENUE AND 65TH STREET -- NIGHT \nIn the synagogue across the street we hear KOL NIDRE being sung by a soprano; an ORGAN accompanying her. Danny looks up at the temple. \nFLASHCUT: EXT. FOREST ROAD -- DAY, 1943 \nLooking up as the Nazi sergeant holds the boy on the bayonet over the father's head. But now Danny is the father, and the father is the sergeant. \nHe lunges at the Nazi, knocking him down, tearing at this throat. The sergeant screams.... \nNAZI SOLDIER (in German, to his fellows) Kill him! \nDanny bites through the Nazi's jugular as bullets rip into him. \nINT. FIFTH AVENUE AT 65TH/INT. KYLE'S CAR -- NIGHT \nKyle's car is parked on the Central Park side of Fifth....Danny gets in the passenger side. Kyle is behind the wheel, wiring an explosive device. Danny hands him the grease-stained bag. \nDANNY How're we doing? \nDANNY No, it has to be tomorrow. You won't get this many of them in here for another year. It'll be fine. \nKYLE It's not going to be fine. It's -- \nDANNY Just do it. \nKyle sighs, goes about doing it, he HEARS SOMETHING and freezes. \nKYLE What's that? \nDanny clicks off the light. A SILHOUETTE on the windows... \nDANNY It's just somebody on the street. \nLight on. Relieved, Kyle turns his attention back to the bomb. \nKYLE When do you want it to go off? \nDANNY Seven-thirty tomorrow evening. \nKYLE So that's what? Nineteen thirty minutes...what time is it now... \nKyle checks his wristwatch, sets the timer to eighteen hours eighteen minutes. It begins counting down. \nEXT. SYNAGOGUE -- NIGHT \nKyle and Danny come around the corner, get in Kyle's car parked near the side door. \nEXT. EIGHTH AVENUE NEWSSTAND -- NIGHT \nA stack of papers, the early edition of the Times. As Danny grabs one, he notices a stack of tabloids.... \nFRONT PAGE: The Manzetti crime scene with screaming headline: \"MANZETTI SLAYER JEWISH NAZI.\" Next to this another tab: \"JEW KILLS JEW?\" \nDanny grabs a Times, flips it over... We see only his face: registering this, unsurprised. He opens the paper.... \nINSERT: TWO PHOTOGRAPHS \nThe sweet-faced bar mitzvah boy we saw at his father's house... And a BLURRY PHOTO of Danny walking away from Guy Danielsen and the photographer outside Mrs. Moebius's house. Danny's face is not clearly seen. \nTILT UP TO DANNY \nCalm. He tucks the paper under his arm beside the machzor and crosses Eighth Avenue toward a cheap hotel.... \nCHEAP HOTEL -- NIGHT \nCarrying the papers, Danny goes through the door. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM -- EARLY MORNING \nDanny at the window, staring out. The TV plays behind him. \nOn TV -- A REPORTER INTERVIEWING MRS. MOEBIUS \nREPORTER ...You're saying that when he first appeared at your house, you had no idea he was Jewish.... \nMRS. MOEBIUS None whatsoever. But I have to admit, I'm not terribly surprised. \nREPORTER What do you mean? \nMRS. MOEBIUS I think anti-semitism today is largely a Jewish phenomenon. Wouldn't you agree? \nDanny can't help smiling at her audacity. \nREPORTER In the Third Reich, weren't a number of high-ranking Nazis of Jewish origin? \nMRS. MOEBIUS Yes, and they were said to be the most virulent proponents of the Final Solution. Really, who but a Jew would want to kill Ilio Manzetti simply because he was Jewish? Who thinks about such things? \nREPORTER The papers are going to report tomorrow that your colleague, Curtis Zampf, has been a federal informant for the past two years. Do you believe that? \nMRS. MOEBIUS (enigmatic smile) Curtis is always more complicated than he seems. Even now. \nREPORTER (to the camera) And so, on this, the most solemn day of the Jewish year, a former yeshiva student is being sought in connection with a monstrous hate crime that -- \nThe set is CLICKED OFF with the remote. In the darkened screen, we see Danny take his bag off the bed and go out the door. \nEXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- LATE AFTERNOON \nChuckles. \nENRAGED WIFE I saw the paper. That's not him, that guy was darker.... This is somebody else. \nVOICE (O.S.) That guy wouldn't go to shul, Barry... \nENRAGED MAN You want to bet? I'll bet you anything... (he's SHUSHED, \"Could you, please...\") Let's go, we're leaving.... \nENRAGED WIFE Oh, for God's sake, you leave. \nENRAGED MAN I'm going to get a cop. \nHe stalks to the door but doesn't leave, turns back as if compelled to watch this outrage...as.... \nDANNY Da-amiran b'alma, v'imru amen... \nHe begins the silent amidah, taking three steps backward, then three forward, bowing as he prays so that he sees the watch on the lectern.... It says: 6:16.... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. A ROOM -- SUNDOWN \nKyle on hands and knees, gasping for breath, his face bloody. DRAKE sits in a chair, injecting methamphetamine into the vein of his forearm. Billings comes through the door with a newspaper. \nBILLINGS I got one.... \nHe squats beside Kyle, shows him the Times story about Danny. \nKYLE Are you kidding me?? \nBILLINGS Now do you know where he is? \nKyle thinks, glances at a watch: 6:47. \nKYLE Yeah, I bet I do. \nINT. SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT \nThe windows have darkened. The congregation is on its feet chanting the AVINU MALKENU, the climactic prayer of the day. \nDanny, leading the prayers, looks up at Carla, Stuart, Miriam...near the front, chanting with him. He looks at the clock: 7:21. \nSuddenly it seems impossible to go through with this. He stops praying, but no one notices.... \nEXT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- TWILIGHT \nAs Kyle, Drake and Billings approach, the place seems to glow with an inner radiance. Drake and Billings hold weapons at their sides. \nThe stocky security guard sees them coming and gets up, reaching for his gun. Billings and Drake stop. Kyle wishes he weren't here. \nEverything suspends for a moment as, within the building, three distinct GROUPS OF VOICES can be heard, each chanting the AVINU MALKENU at a slightly different point in the prayer. \nDrake raises his gun and fires. \nINT. JEWISH COMMUNITY CENTER -- SMALL AUDITORIUM -- TWILIGHT \nPeople are chanting AVINU MALKENU so fervently that the GUNFIRE outside seems only a faint POPPING. No one particularly notices. Danny, freaking, doesn't hear the gunshots. He tries to address the people in the front rows.... \nDANNY Wait a minute... \nBut the praying is too loud, too strong. No one stops or listens. He steps down off the bema.... \nDANNY Stop praying. You've got to get out of here.... All of you... \nA few people in front are puzzled by his strange behavior, but the rest keep chanting. Stuart comes up to Danny.... \nSTUART You wanted to daven. Now daven.... \nDanny glances over people's heads at the clock: 7:25. He doesn't notice... \nTHE DOOR \nBANGS open. DRAKE stands there, .357, bleeding profusely from the head, the swastika on his lips. At first, only a few people notice, they stop praying. \nPEOPLE (panic, confusion) Who's that?... What is he...oh, my God... \nAvi is the first one out of his chair, walks right at Drake. \n", "test1_input": "LINDA The Polacks? From Sacred Heart? \nDANNY Nobody ever beat me up. (as she sighs, turns to go) Look, Linda, there're fifty reasons. Even if you knew them all, there'd be another fifty you didn't know. \nLINDA Do you know them? (off him) I made him some noodles for dinner. You can heat them up and -- \nDANNY I've got to get back to the -- \nLINDA You can heat them up and eat with him. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, QUEENS HOUSE -- NIGHT \nDanny (now wearing a plain white T-shirt) bends over the coffee table eating a noodle casserole and reading the Post. His father eats off a TV table. He finishes, cursorily wipes his mouth, picks up a remote and turns on the television. \nDANNY It's Friday.... \nFATHER (a hoarse rasp) Do I give a shit? \nDanny holds up both hands: he's not arguing, simply informing. \nFATHER The Torah says not to light a fire on the Sabbath, because it's work, correct? (Danny sighs) But if alternating current's running through the wires every second of every day, and I throw a switch, send it here instead of there, how is that lighting a fire? \nDANNY \"Do chickens give milk?\" \nFATHER Exactly. \nHe channel-surfs until he comes to a stand-up COMIC doing a routine. They both watch. \nTV: the COMIC is funny in a brutal, compulsive way. Lots of pop references, implicit postmodern nihilism. The routine reflects what Danny (and the Shiites, the Unabomber, Timothy McVeigh, T.S. Eliot, et al.) have against the modern world. \nFATHER Who's this? \nDANNY Dennis Leary. \nFATHER Leary? \nDANNY No. \nThe father grunts with grim satisfaction, he suspected as much. \nDANNY (offering consolation) Howard Stern. \nFATHER Obviously. \nDanny sighs: why bother. But adds... \nDANNY Adam Sandler. \nFATHER Funny? \nDANNY Not like Mr. Dorfmann. \nFATHER He was funny. \nAs they watch, apropos of nothing: \nFATHER After your mother died, that's when you stopped going to shul. Doing your homework. Everything. \nDANNY And that's when the Mets started to stink. \nFATHER 'Cause they got rid of Johnson. He knew how to deal with the assholes. Dallas Green, please... \nDANNY Valentine... \nThe father snorts. On TV the comic gets off a line, and they both laugh. Their laughs are quite similar; they glance at each other. \nFATHER There's some maple walnut in the freezer. \nDANNY Linda says you're not supposed to have dairy. \nFATHER Just a little... What's the difference? \nDanny goes into the kitchen. The father extracts a pack of Salems from between the cushions, lights one, takes a desperate drag... The phone RINGS. He curses, stubs it out, grabs the phone. \nFATHER Yeah?... Hold on.... It's for you. \nDanny gives his father a dish of ice cream, takes the phone. \n", "test1_true": "VOICE Daniel Balint? My name's Guy Danielsen. I'm a reporter with the New York Times. \nDANNY (impressed, suspicious) New York Times...? \nHis father looks up. Danny takes the phone into the kitchen. \nVOICE I'm doing a piece on right-wing groups, post Oklahoma City. I hear you're an important figure in those circles. You have a lot of interesting ideas.... \nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nDANNY Who told you that? \nVOICE Isn't it true? \nDANNY No, it's...yeah, it's true, but... how'd you get this number?... No, not here... Maybe Sunday? There's a place off Queens Blvd. Near the courthouse... \nEXT. COFFEE SHOP, QUEENS -- DAY \nA HIGH-ANGLE view of the coffee shop. After a moment, Danny enters frame, starts toward it.... \nINT. COFFEE SHOP, QUEENS -- DAY \nDanny enters, looks around. To his surprise he sees GUY DANIELSEN from the Nazi meeting rising, extending his hand. \nGUY DANIELSEN Danny...Guy Danielsen... \nDANNY (sardonic, now he gets it) You... \nGuy shrugs, smiles apologetically. \nANOTHER ANGLE -- DANNY & GUY WITH COFFEE \nGUY Milk...? \nAs Danny declines, Guy gets out a small cassette recorder, is about to turn it on, when he notices Danny's reaction.... \nGUY Is it okay if I record this? \nDANNY No... Yeah, fine, go ahead... So what's this about? Is this about me? \nGUY I'm trying to figure out where the radical right is going to next....I thought you were the most interesting person at that meeting. \nDANNY What about Curtis Zampf? \nGUY Curtis is a politician -- and a bit of a hustler. He's not a thinker. \nDANNY I agree. \nGUY The other night you said the modern world is a Jewish disease. Could you elaborate on that? \nDANNY In the movement -- the racialist movement -- we believe there's a hierarchy of the races. Not just in IQ, but in the civilization, the art, the forms of government, the civilizations that each race produces... Why are you writing this down if you're recording it? \nGUY It helps me concentrate.... So does that mean you're a white supremacist? \nDANNY What should I be, a white inferior- ist? A multicultural Zulu egalitarian? Let me ask, where are your people from? \nGUY My mother's family is French, my father's was German, originally. \nDANNY German. Mine, too. So who do you think's given more to the world, the Germans -- Beethoven, Goethe, Nietzsche -- or the entire continent of Africa? Ibos, Bantus, Mandingos... \nGUY Danny, what about the Jews? \nDanny shifts in his seat, growing more interested.... \nDANNY The Jews are different.... Blacks are disgusting and inferior, but it's like criticizing a retarded child. The Jews are...a poison in the human well.... \nGUY A poison...? \nDANNY Let me give you an example.... Sexuality. \nGUY Sexuality??? What do you mean? \nDANNY You ever fuck a Jewish girl? \nGUY What??!? \nDANNY Did you ever fuck one, Guy? \n", "test1_id": 1956, "test2_input": "CARLA No. \nShe tries to pull free; he won't let her go. \nLINA (O.S.) Carla! \nCARLA Just after midnight. Five past... But don't come through the house, they'll hear you. I'm in the back bedroom, second floor. Climb onto the kitchen roof, I'll leave the window open. \nHe tries to kiss her, but she ducks away and goes out. \nEXT. STREET/INT. O.L.'S VAN -- EVENING \nDanny is parked opposite a fortresslike building of soiled brick. For a long time he cannot bring himself to get out. Finally he opens the door.... \nINT. AHAVAT TORAH, FOYER -- EVENING \nA LARGE WOMAN, about 40, her body barely contained by a brilliant magenta dress, greets him with a smile the size of a wedding cake. She holds out a prayer book stuffed with flyers. \nLARGE WOMAN Shabbat shalom. \nShe speaks quietly, not wanting to disturb the service, yet even so her voice is huge, and her flashing eyes clearly expect some kind of enthusiastic response. Within we hear the ALENU being chanted. \nDanny ignores her and the proffered siddur. A basket of yarmulkes seems to infuriate him, but he snatches one anyway and, conveying a helpless disgust, puts it on his head. From within he hears... \nCONGREGATION (O.S.) (in rough unison) Ba-yom, ha-hoo, ba-yom, ha hoo...(etc.) \nHe stands with his hand on the door, but not opening it. \nRABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE (O.S.) On that day, the Eternal shall be One. And His Name shall be One.... \nThe organist plays a brief decrescendo.... \nRABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE The mourner's kaddish can be found on page 187.... \nLARGE WOMAN Is anything wrong? \nDANNY Shut the fuck up. \nShe's startled but not intimidated, is about to respond, when Danny simply turns and walks out of the building. \nEXT. AHAVAT TORAH -- EVENING \nHe stops beneath an open window through which he hears... \nRABBI'S AMPLIFIED VOICE ...Grant us peace, thy most precious gift, O Thou Eternal source of peace. We recall with loving memory those whom Thou hast summoned unto thee. And we mention by name...Sophie Budnitz...Bernard Schwabb...Milton Lifter...Aaron Lustig...Minnie Baum... \nDanny closes his eyes, but at the end adds, under her breath: \nDANNY ...Harriet Kantor Balint... \nA half dozen VOICES, including Danny's, recite in unison... \nDANNY & OTHERS Yis-ga-dal v'yis-ka-dash sh'may ra-bo... \nThe body of the congregation joins in on certain phrases, producing a subtle and solemn music. Danny chants the entire prayer, and the moment it ends, and the rabbi begins the benediction.... \nRABBI'S VOICE (AMPLIFIED) May the Lord bless you and keep you.... \nEXT. AHAVAT TORAH/STREET -- EVENING \n...he starts toward his car. But the Rabbi's VOICE seems to follow him, unnaturally loud and clear: \nRABBI (O.S.) May He cause the light of His countenance to shine upon you and be gracious unto you.... \nDANNY (to himself) Eat shit.... \nRABBI (O.S.) ...May you be blessed in your going forth as you were in your coming.... \nDANNY (shouting to the empty street) EAT SHIT, ASSHOLES.... \nRABBI (O.S.) And let us say... \nRABBI & CONGREGATION (with organ; singsong) Ah -- ah -- ah....men.... \nAs Danny reaches the van, he sees the LARGE WOMAN silhouetted in the open doorway.... \nLARGE WOMAN YOU EAT SHIT. \n", "test2_true": "A WRISTWATCH: 12:05. We are: \nEXT. FARMHOUSE -- NIGHT \nDanny hoists himself onto the kitchen roof. Above him is an open window, candlelight flickering. He starts into the room, stops.... \nINT. BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nCarla sits on the bed, straddling Curtis, who lies beneath her. She is looking right at Danny. Curtis, unaware of him, keeps thrusting into her from below. \nDanny starts to leave, but on second thought stays. Carla stares expressionless, yet more attentive to him than to Curtis. Indeed, their eyes never leave each other, so that when she becomes aroused, we understand that it is Danny she is responding to, Danny she is really making love to. \nGradually her face loses its aloofness and seems to reach out to him, to reveal feelings that she can no longer deny. She holds her gaze until, at the final instant, she shudders out a series of stifled cries. \nWhen she looks again, the window is empty. \nINT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- DAY \nDanny reading. A KNOCK at the door. He looks up, Curtis comes in. Danny stiffens at the sight of him, but Curtis is friendly. \nCURTIS What are you reading? \nDanny tilts the book to show him: History of Political Philosophy. \nCURTIS Leo Strauss... (nods approvingly) I've got to go to Boston. I came to say goodbye. \nDANNY What about Mrs. Moebius and...? \nCURTIS They left an hour ago. (off Danny's disappointment) You mind some personal advice? Forget Carla. That's not the side your bread's buttered on. (off Danny's silence) How soon can you get back to the city? \nDANNY A week or so. There's something I want to do here first. \nCURTIS What's that? (off Danny's silence) Okay. Surprise us... \nINT. DARKNESS -- NIGHT \nThe sound of SPLITTING WOOD. Then VOICES in a cavernous space... \nCHAOS OF VOICES Ow, shit... You're stepping on my fucking -- ...Get off me...Goddammit... (sounds of PUNCHES, a SCUFFLE) Stop it!... Where's the light? \nOne appears, illuminating nothing, dissipating into the still vaster darkness. A SERIES OF LIGHTS bang on in ecclesiastical bursts, illuminating: a vaulted ceiling... stained glass panels... We are: \nINT. SYNAGOGUE SANCTUARY -- NIGHT \nA dour, ornate place built in the early decades of the century. The sight of it silences everyone for a moment. Then... \nCARLETON Jew World...!! \nDrake, Billings, Carleton, O.L. and Steroid run wild... kicking over benches...spray-painting swastikas...hurling prayer books...urinating from the balcony... \n...Danny looks around like someone revisiting his childhood home: slides his hand along a pew back...leafs through a chumash...gazes up at the eternal lamp behind its red glass...the gilded doors of the ark... A hint of Kol Nidre MUSIC haunts him.... \nDANNY (to himself, barely a whisper) Shut up. Fuck you.... \nKYLE (O.S.) What...? \nDanny turns; Kyle is right behind him. \nDANNY Nothing. Where is it? (as Kyle hoists a sports bag) Okay, let's take one of these panels off so we can get under the bema...the stage. \nAs they unscrew a panel, Carleton runs past. A football flashes overhead. We hear GLASS BREAK...LAUGHTER. \nINT. UNDER THE STAGE -- NIGHT \nDANNY WATCHES KYLE attach a bomb (four sticks of dynamite wired to a digital timer) to a 2x4 with a bungee cord. He hooks the ends, cautiously lets go. The cord springs free. The bomb falls. \nKyle gasps. Danny catches it. \nFrozen, they look at each other. Kyle exhales, takes the bomb and, with Danny holding it, carefully restrings the bungee. A MECHANICAL NOISE overhead: \nSTEROID (O.S.) Wow, look at this shit.... \nDANNY What are they doing? \nKyle has no idea and doesn't care. Danny scrambles out. \nINT. SANCTUARY -- NIGHT \n", "test2_id": 1957, "test3_input": "KYLE No, it's weird, man. Nobody knows where he went. \nDanny nods, gestures for Kyle to split. Kyle looks around, walks away. Danny waits a moment, then heads in the opposite direction. \nEXT. WILLIAMSBURG -- DAY \nDanny walking behind a Hasidic family (MAN, WOMAN, 3-year- old BOY, STROLLER)...watching them. At a corner, the father takes the boy's hand, and as they cross the street, the boy glances back at Danny. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD -- DAY, 1943 \nTWO NAZI SOLDIERS have just discovered a JEWISH FAMILY hiding in the back of a hay wagon. The POLISH MAN is holding the little boy. \nAs a soldier tries to take the BOY out of his arms, the child panics, clings to his father, screaming, \"Papa... Papa...\" It is the scene the survivor described in the meeting with the Nazis. But now the father is DANNY'S FATHER.... \nFATHER (IN POLISH) ...Hush, come on, don't cry. Everything will be all right.... \nA Nazi sergeant comes over, irritated. The sergeant is Danny. \nDANNY/NAZI SERGEANT (in German) What's the matter here? \nFATHER (to the Sergeant, in German) Excuse me, I'm sorry, just a moment... \nThe sergeant rips the child out of his arms. The kid becomes hysterical. The father manages to take the boy's hand. \nFATHER (in Polish) Please, sweetheart, you have to go. I'll see you soon. \nIn an access of disgust, the sergeant sticks his bayonet into the boy -- or rather, into something offscreen. We hear a terrible sound, the child grunts. The family gasps in horror. \nDanny/sergeant lifts the (unseen) child into the air. Its SHADOW darkens the father's face. Drops of blood run down his cheeks.... \nDanny/sergeant stares into the father's face, enraged at the man's passivity. \nDANNY/NAZI SERGEANT Fucking kike. \nEXT. STREET -- DAY \nDANNY'S FACE -- sweating, haunted, as if he's just woken from the previous. \nHe's still walking down the street, but now, as if to flee his thoughts, he steps through a door into... \nINT. BOOKSTORE -- DAY \nA Jewish bookstore. He grabs the first book that comes to hand, reads for a moment, throws it down in disgust. Picks it up again, is still reading when... \nVOICE Hey, Danny...Danny... \nHe looks up at a young man about his own age; wearing a yarmulke, but otherwise normal, hair clean, beard neatly trimmed. \nYOUNG MAN It's Stuart. Stuart Schoenbaum. \nDANNY Shlomo? \nSTUART Yeah... \nDanny puts down the book, trying to conceal that he's been reading it. He offers a hand. Stuart manages to restrain the impulse to embrace him, but takes the hand warmly. \nSTUART Jeez, it's been since, what, Kenny's wedding. \nDANNY Yeah, uh... So how are you? What's going on? \nSTUART I'm in the rabbinic program at JTS... \nDANNY JTS...? \nSTUART What about you? What are you doing? Something strange, I bet. \nDANNY I'm in a kind of...underground...thing. \nSTUART (impressed, excited) Are you an artist? \nDANNY No, no... Not that kind of... underground. More a private... business. Private. \nMeaning he can't talk about it. Stuart nods. Danny notices a young woman: dark, curly hair, sharp eyes. \nSTUART You remember Miriam.... \nDANNY Yeah, hey, how're you doing... \n", "test3_true": "An irony to her. They certainly remember each other. \nSTUART She's at Yale Law -- interning with the district attorney... (Miriam makes a face) We're getting married next spring. In Israel. \nDANNY Wow, that's uh...great... \nHe glances at Miriam; but she has picked up the book he'd been reading, is leafing through it. It makes him uneasy. \nSTUART It's great seeing you.... \nMIRIAM Maybe Danny'd like to come to the minyan for the holidays.... \nDanny gives her a dirty look, but Stuart's thrilled: \nSTUART Oh, good idea. We're davening with this group from the seminary. Interesting people, very open-minded, you might like them. And guess who comes...Avi! You guys could go at it again like the good old days. \nAs Stuart scribbles an address... \nSTUART Danny and Avi used to argue about everything. Torah, Talmud, politics, girls. It always ended in a fistfight. \nMIRIAM I remember. \nDANNY I always won. \nMIRIAM The arguments, anyway. \nSTUART (hands Danny the address) It's a K.I. on 101st. In the little chapel. Try to make it. It'd be fun. \nDanny smiles. He has no intention of going. Once they leave, he picks up the book and resumes reading. \nINT. AN EXECUTIVE SUITE -- DAY \nROGER BRAND, a high-powered CEO, sits behind a big desk, speed-reading something through half-glasses. He finishes, removes the glasses. A New York Times is on the desk. \nBRAND You write that? (as Danny nods) Come work for me. You've got a lot to learn; I can teach it to you. \nDANNY I have a job. \nBRAND This? This is a joke. (tossing down the pages) I'll give your group a thousand bucks. \nDANNY You gave fifty thousand to that college magazine. \nBRAND Fifty's an exaggeration. Anyway, that was a different moment. Things were possible that aren't now. \nDANNY Actually, I think this moment has possibilities that -- \nBRAND Yeah, I read your piece. It's very smart. And very wrong. \nBrand's phone beeps, he touches a button, continues. \nBRAND Forget the Jewish stuff. It doesn't play anymore. (over Danny's) There's only the market, now, and it doesn't care who you are. \nDANNY People still need values, beliefs.... \nBRAND No, they don't. Not the smart ones. (because he likes him) Look, I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax-exempt status.... But when you fall off this horse, come see me. I can show you how to make a lot of money. \nDANNY I don't care about money. \nBRAND You will. \nDANNY You're a Jew. Maybe you don't realize it, but you are. \nBRAND (smiles, uninsulted) Maybe I am. Maybe we're all Jews now. What's the difference? \nOn Danny, troubled by this. \nINT. A SMALL LECTURE HALL -- EVENING \nA half-dozen white lumpen sit at desks. Danny writes \"ANTI- SEMITISM\" in large letters on a blackboard. He turns.... \nDANNY How many of you think of yourselves as anti-Semites? (All the hands go up.) Good. Actually, the term is a bit imprecise since technically Jews are only one of the Semitic peoples.... In fact, Arabs are Semites, as are the Eritreans, the Ethiopians, and so on.... But for our purposes an anti- Semite is someone who hates or is against Jews.... Now, why do we hate them? \nHe looks around. The room is silent. \nDANNY Let me put it another way. Do we hate them because they push their way in where they don't belong? Or because they're clannish and keep to themselves? \nMurmurs of \"Yeah. Both.\" But some are confused by this. \n", "test3_id": 1958}

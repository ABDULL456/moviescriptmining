BRANDT You should never give a name to anything you are certain to lose. FRIEDRICH His leg is not good enough, sir. 
BRANDT Private, you will do as you are told. (CALLING OFF) Hook him up. 
Friedrich has no choice but as he starts to lead Topthorn, Joey rears up and escapes his groom. He gallops up the hill to the gun - offering himself up to save Topthorn. It is his "Tale of Two Cities" moment - giving up his life to save his friend. He bucks and rears. Friedrich turns to Brandt. 
FRIEDRICH As you see, sir, this one is stronger. Brandt takes up Friedrich, and Joey's, offer - 
BRANDT Hook him up. 
As Joey is hooked to the gun, he looks back to Friedrich who leads Topthorn back down the hill. 
EXT. STEEP INCLINE. LATER. 
The convoy struggles up the hill. Joey feels the dead weight of the gun. These are several tons of cast iron - almost dwarfing the horses. Friedrich notices. Together, this grim circus struggles along the pot-holed country road in the rain. 
Joey leads the team up the incline. Each step is an immense effort. The going, over rough scree, is very tough indeed. It is very difficult for Joey to get a foothold on the loose ground, but his experience in Dartmoor comes into play and although he almost loses his balance several times he stays upright and hauls the cannon - Fitzcarraldo-like - over the hill. 
We follow his progress step by step. Friedrich watches anxiously. Soldiers strain at the sides of the gun. One throws boards under the wheels to aid in traction. As they reach the top of the hill it almost seems the effort is too much, the cannon always in danger of rolling back. Joey finally staggers over the top - it feels as though the tethers are going to snap with the strain - but at last the cannon reaches the peak, the crest of the hill. 
EXT. THE BATTLEFIELD. DAY. Soldiers scurry around the giant gun, preparing it. 
OFFICER Halt! Halt! Take the horses away! 
ARTILLERY OFFICER Shell! 
Friedrich observes with Topthorn as a giant shell is carried to the gun's breech. 
ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D) And load! 
The men wrestle it into place - 
ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D) Back! Case! - and secure it. 
ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D) Position! 
The barrel of the giant gun ratchets upward. 
ARTILLERY OFFICER (CONT'D) And...fire! 
The shell explodes from the barrel. And then from another. And another. For the first time we see the big picture - the line of assembled cannons of which they were just one tiny part. 
Each gun recoils violently as they shoot their shells into oblivion - as soon as one shell is fired another is loaded - the noise is deafening - the line seemingly endless - an obscene production line of death. This is what the horses have been feeding - this massive merciless thing. 
Smoke wafts from the guns as we see the explosions in the distance. The sound of the explosions takes us to - 
EXT. BRITISH TRENCH. NIGHT. 
Explosions light the dirty faces of British boys in uniform, one after the next. Each light fading out before the next great blast illuminates another anonymous face -then another - and then another - and then ALBERT. Hold on him for extra moments before he fades completely. 
EXT. BRITISH TRENCHES. EARLY DAWN. TITLE: FRANCE - 1918, THE SOMME 
With the barrage lifted, the British soldiers that are huddled in a low sub-trench, are ordered back on the line. Andrew Easton is with Albert and he's shaken and terrified. A far cry from the happy young boy we knew. 
A gruff sergeant (SERGEANT MARTIN) walks the trench with a bucket and each soldier puts in their valuables and personal belongings. One a lighter, some money, etc. 
SERGEANT MARTIN Valuables in the bucket, lads. If you live, you'll get them back. If you live, you'll get them back. Good lads. 
Albert and Andrew move down the trench in a line of soldiers who are given ammo belts and grenades. 
Albert gets his grenades and walks further along the trenches. We follow him in real time as he passes a bunch of soldiers who are kneeling in the ankle deep water, a PADRE is giving them communion. The deafening noise of shelling all around. 
ANDREW Maybe it's a drill, Albie. Maybe it's a drill like last time. 
We keep following Albert's progress in real time - further on there is a post box where they all put their final letters home in identical green envelopes. We see Albert's letter addressed to "Ted and Rose Narracott" in Devon. He posts it in a battered metal post box. 
An officer approaches: 
DAVID Love letter? 
ALBERT That's my business.

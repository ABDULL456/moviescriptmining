MAC Who is the kid? 
JUNO The baby? I don't know anything about it yet. I only know it's got fingernails, allegedly. 
BREN Nails? Really? 
MAC No, I mean the father! Who's the father, Juno? 
JUNO Oh. It's, well, it's Paulie Bleeker. 
Bren and Mac burst into shocked laughter. 
JUNO What? 
MAC Paulie Bleeker? I didn't know he had it in him! 
BREN (giggling) He just doesn't look, well, virile. 
LEAH I know, right? 
MAC Okay, this is no laughing matter. 
JUNO (indignant) No, it's not. Paulie is virile, by the way. He was very good in... chair. 
Leah fires a be quiet glance at Juno. 
MAC Did you say you were thinking about adoption? 
JUNO Yeah, well, there's this couple who've been trying to have a baby for five years. 
LEAH We found them in the Penny Saver by the exotic birds section. 
Bren looks understandably alarmed. Juno hastily attempts to make the situation sound more legitimate. 
JUNO But they have a real lawyer and everything. I'm going to meet with them next weekend. 
BREN Junebug, that is a tough, tough thing to do. Probably tougher than you can understand right now. 
JUNO Well, I'm not ready to be a mom. 
MAC Damn skippy, you're not! You don't even remember to give Liberty Bell her breathing meds. 
JUNO Once! And she didn't die, if you recall! 
BREN Honey, had you considered, you know, the alternative? 
Leah and Juno exchange glances. 
JUNO No. 
BREN Well, you're a brave young lady. You're made of stronger stuff than I thought. You're a little Viking! 
JUNO Cool it. 
BREN First things first, we have to get you healthy. You need prenatal vitamins. Incidentally, they'll do incredible things for your nails, so that's a plus. Oh, and we need to schedule a doctor's appointment. Find out where you're going to deliver. 
JUNO The term "deliver" is so weird. Can we not say "deliver"? 
LEAH How does "crap it out" sound? 
MAC Juno, I want to come with you to meet these adoption people. You're just a kid. I don't want you to get ripped off by a couple of babystarved wingnuts. 
JUNO Sure, Dad. 
Mac nods, satisfied, then contemplates the situation dismally. 
MAC I thought you were the kind of girl who knew when to say when.

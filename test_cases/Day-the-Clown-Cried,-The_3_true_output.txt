CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT 
As the "fly" lands on his nose.  He looks cross-eyed at the mud blob, then swats at it.  The blob falls off. 
MED. SHOT - CHILDREN 
There are now nine or ten youngsters at the fence, all squealing with delight. 
CLOSE SHOT - HELMUT 
He bows again, and as his head comes up he looks o.s. toward his barracks, still hoping that someone will be watching his "great" success.  When he turns back to the children, we see that he continues to smile -- while tears course down his cheeks through the mud still caked on them. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MESS HALL - DAY 
The last barracks on the open end of the camp on the political prisoners' side.  Outside the building is a low counter arrangement with two prisoners behind it serving mush and black bread to a long line of men, all of whom carry bowls and spoons. 
This time in mid-July, three weeks after the incident at the fence.  The day is bright and hot.  Our ANGLE FAVORS Helmut as he nears the prisoner who is serving up the mush. 
MED. SHOT - HELMUT 
As he moves up to be served and holds out his bowl.  The prisoner - messman spoons a blob of mush into it.  Then he looks around quickly and, before Helmut can pull back his bowl, slops another half spoonful into it with a wink at Helmut, who gives him a grateful smile in return.  Helmut moves on to the bread server, who gives him a big grin as he slips two pieces of bread into the bowl on top of the mush. Helmut hurries away, the CAMERA FOLLOWING him. 
He walks strangely, as if having trouble controlling his own feet.  Helmut ducks around the corner of the barracks nearest the mess hall, then peers cautiously back into the main yard. Satisfied that he hasn't been noticed, he quickly puts one piece of bread into his pocket and takes out his spoon. Holding the second piece of bread beneath the bowl, he wolfs down a few mouthfuls of the mush.  Then he smooths out the remainder with the spoon to make the mush appear untouched. He places the one slice of bread back on top of it, and studies the end result.  Nodding approval, he licks his spoon clean and puts it back in his pocket.  He goes back around the corner of the barracks into the main yard and heads for the next building. 
CLOSE SHOT - BARE FEET 
This pair of massive feet are the property of the Big Prisoner, a massive hulk of a man. 
OLD PRISONER'S VOICE Don't know how you can go without shoes.  Soles of my feet are too sensitive. 
The CAMERA PANS UPWARD to the Big Prisoner and an Old Prisoner, sitting against the side of their hut.  The Old Prisoner, a frail man, with shirt off, is finishing his mush. 
BIG PRISONER It's my stomach that's sensitive. 
OLD PRISONER (looking o.s., smiles) Here comes your second helping. 
As Helmut's feet walk into FRAME and stop next to the Big Prisoner, we see the reason for his peculiar walk.  He is wearing a pair of enormous shoes, many sizes too large for him and cut open along the soles from the toes to the insteps so that they flap as he moves along. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
as Helmut joins them and holds out his bowl of bread and mush to the Big Prisoner. 
HELMUT Here. 
Still grinning, the Big Prisoner puts his empty bowl on the ground beside him and takes Helmut's bowl.  Holding the bread aside, he digs into the mush.  Helmut watches him eat, his own hunger written all over his face.  After a few bites, this makes the Big Prisoner a little self-concious. 
BIG PRISONER How're the shoes? 
HELMUT Perfect. 
The Big Prisoner nods and goes back to eating, satisfied that he has made a fair bargain and shouldn't be embarrassed about taking Helmut's food. 
HELMUT Don't forget the bowl. 
The Big Prisoner, his mouth full of mush, only nods.  Helmut, tearing his eyes from the food, moves off.  The Big Prisoner watches him go.  Suddenly, he looks down at the departing Helmut's feet, and his face darkens. 
BIG PRISONER (irked) Hey, Doork! 
Helmut stops and turns as the Big Prisoner shoves himself away from the hut and goes to him, staring down at the shoes. 
BIG PRISONER My shoes! 
The Big Prisoner reaches out with the large toe of one bare foot and lifts up the flapping toe of one of Helmut's shoes. He lets it drop again. 
BIG PRISONER I said you could use 'em, not ruin 'em. 
HELMUT I had to fix them this way...  for the act, you know.  Wait till you see how funny it is. 
BIG PRISONER Yeah.  But will I feel like laughing when it gets cold! 
HELMUT Don't worry. 
BIG PRISONER Worry!  I'm the one who'll get frost bitten toes, not you. 
HELMUT When I return them, they'll be like new.  I promise. 
The Old Prisoner has finished his mush and puts his bowl down on the ground and moves forward to join Helmut and the Big Prisoner. 
BIG PRISONER For what you've done to my shoes I should get more food. 
OLD PRISONER He's got to have something to eat. 
The Big Prisoner looks at him questioningly. 
OLD PRISONER (continuing) If he gives you his other meal... he'll starve to death.  Then you won't get anything. 
This reasoning makes sense to the Big Prisoner. 
BIG PRISONER (to Helmut) Remember... you fix them before you bring 'em back. 
HELMUT Promise.

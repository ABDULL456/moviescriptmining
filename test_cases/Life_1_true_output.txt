DILLARD Mail call! 
The incorrigibles quickly gather around as he calls off names, passing cards and letters through the crowd. 
DILLARD Craddock!... Williams... Henshaw!... Banks! 
CLAUDE Here! 
Dillard hands the letter to Ray, who glances at it before passing it back to Claude. 
RAY (reading) Maynard Banks, Esquire. Attorney at law. 
CLAUDE Gimme that. That doesn't concern you. 
RAY I'm sure it don't. 
INT. CAMP 8 BUNKHOUSE -- DAY 
Claude rips open the letter. A profound disappointment settles over him as he reads the news from cousin Maynard. Bitterly, he crumples up the letter and tosses it down. 
EXT. FIELD - DAY 
Dillard strolls down the line with his rifle over his shoulder. Under his watchful gaze, hoes rise and fall. After he passes, Claude moves a little closer to Ray. 
CLAUDE What's up, Ray? 
RAY (cool) Claude. 
CLAUDE Sure is hot today. Think it'll rain later? 
RAY What do you want, Claude? 
CLAUDE What do I want? What makes you think I want something? 
RAY My daddy always said when a man starts talking about the weather keep you hand on your wallet. 
CLAUDE Your daddy must have been a helluva guy, a deep man, a wise man. Sure wish I could have met him -- 
RAY Cut the bullshit. What do you want, Claude? 
CLAUDE (clearing his throat) You still got that map? 
RAY Yeah. 
CLAUDE Well, if you're still thinking about booking it, I want in. I think we can make it. 
RAY We? Did I hear you say we? As I recall, you're the one who said there is no we. Guess we got some bad news in that letter, huh? 
CLAUDE Look, my cousin Maynard is a lawyer. He filed an appeal on my behalf -- 
RAY On your behalf. What happened to we? 
CLAUDE The appeal was denied. Then Daisy went and fell for Maynard. They're engaged to be married, can you believe that? 
RAY Well, let's just think about that for a moment. He's a successful lawyer up in New York City and you're down here with a bright future in the cotton picking business. Eeny, meeny, miney, Maynard. 
CLAUDE Come on, man. Don't shut me out. I'm telling you, you and me, that map, we can go places. 
RAY You know what, Claude? This whole time we've been down here, you've done nothing but think about yourself, acting like this whole thing is my fault. That plan with your cousin, did that include me? 
A long beat. 
CLAUDE No. 
RAY At least you're honest for once. So now you want to be my friend? Well, let me tell you something, Claude-my- shit-don't-stink-Banks. You got a lot to learn about friendship. 
CLAUDE Does that mean I'm in? 
RAY I don't think so, Claude. You'd just slow me down. We'd have to stop every five minutes so you could polish your silverware. There's no way around it, you're soft. 
CLAUDE What'd you say? 
RAY I said you're soft. 
CLAUDE Don't call me that. You know I hate it when you call me that. 
Ray gets in Claude's face and silently mouths the word -- "soft." Claude throws down his hoe and sinks his fist deep into Ray's gut. 
CLAUDE Damn, that felt good. I should have done that the first time I met you. 
Ray touches the blood coming from his nose. Eyes blazing, he tackles Claude, dragging him to the ground. The two men roll around, trying to strangle each other. 
Hoppin' Bob hustles down the hill and drags Ray off of Claude. But Claude comes back for more. Hoppin' Bob finds himself in the middle of the fray. 
That's when the cavalry arrives. Two trusties use their rifles to crack Ray and Claude over the backs of their heads, sending them both down for the count.

(turning to McClane) ...Or is he married? \nMCCLANE Married. \nMcClane tries to get comfortable, scowls as a RUSTLING NOISE reveals wrappers and styrofoam from Taco Bell.  He scowls at Argyle. \nARGYLE The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front. (back to the topic) So, your lady live out here? \nMCCLANE The past six months. \nARGYLE (thinking about that) Meanwhile, you still live in New York? \nMCCLANE You're nosey, you know that, Argyle? \nARGYLE Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me. \nMCCLANE (amused) It's okay, it's okay. \nARGYLE (instantly) So, you divorced of what? \nMcClane gives up. \nMCCLANE She had a good job, it turned into a great career. \nARGYLE But meant her moving here. \nMCCLANE Closer to Japan.  You're fast. \nARGYLE So, why didn't you come? \nMCCLANE 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move. \nARGYLE (to the point) You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack? \nMcClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct. \nMCCLANE Like I said, Argyle...you're fast. \nARGYLE (popping in a cassette) Mind if I play some tunes? \nA hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers. \nMCCLANE How 'bout some Christmas music? \nARGYLE That is Christmas music. \nAnd damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.

McClane goes there, signs in. \nMCCLANE Holly McClane? \nThe Guard points to a prominent touch screen computer console. \nGUARD Just type it in there. \nMcClane is confused for a moment, then he moves to the screen. He gives the Guard a look...the Guard raises his eyebrows as if to say give it a try. \n13-A    SCREEN - CLOSER                                       13-A \nMcClane types, \"McClane, Holly\".

He rotates his head, getting out the travel cricks. \nAs he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING, THROBBING NOISE.  McClane stops and listens before he realizes -- it's the party.  As the doors open the noise ATTACKS us. \n15      30TH FLOOR - SAME                                      15 \nMcClane moves around the edge of the party, gradually spiraling inward.  He grabs a glass of Mimosa champagne punch from a passing tray, sips...scowls.  Spotting open beers in an ice bucket, he tosses the punch into a potted plant, even burying the plastic glass.  Sipping the beer, he moves through the dense party.  People he doesn't know throw streamers over him. \nA WOMAN kisses him.  He grins.  A MAN kisses him. \nMCCLANE (to himself, shaking his head) California... \nFinally he queries a DANCING WOMAN.  The MUSIC drowns out their words but she nods, points off in some generic direction. \nMcClane heads that way, cuts around a Christmas tree, loses his bearings.  He sees: \n15-A    TAKAGI                                                 15-A \nwho has an air of authority.

Another one. McClane is staggering.  He gets in one hard punch and then Karl charges at him.  McClane falls backwards, drives his legs upwards, propelling Karl into the air: \n338     LOW ANGLE                                             338 \nKarl goes into a loop of chain hanging over a turbine, becomes entangled. \n339     MCCLANE                                               339 \njumps to his feet, yanks the other end of the chain. \n340     KARL                                                  340 \nis JERKED upwards by the neck.  He TWITCHES like a captured fish -- starts to turn blue: \n341     MCCLANE                                               341 \nTwists the chain end around a pipe as Karl STILLS.

His back to the CAMERA, Uli goes to the door, OPENS it -- and TWO BULLETS COME OUT HIS BACK.  Smoking Baretta in hand, McClane vaults over the body before it has even stopped twitching.  As the hostages SQUEAL and SCREAM, McClane snatches up Uli's machine gun, runs out onto the roof.  He charges through the crowd, spots Ginny near the edge of the roof.  She meets him halfway. \nMCCLANE Where's Holly -- \nGINNY The took her -- after they saw the kids on television -- \nMCCLANE What?  God -- \nHe looks off to the choppers.  Closer yet.

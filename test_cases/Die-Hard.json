We ARE LOOKING east past Inglewood INTO the orange grid of L.A. at night when suddenly we TILT UP TO CATCH the huge belly of a landing 747 -- the noise is deafening. \n2       INT. 747 - PASSENGERS - SAME                           2 \nThe usual moment just after landing when you let out that sigh of relief that you've made it in one piece.  As the plane TAXIS to its gate, they stir, gather personal belongings. \n3       ON JOHN MCCLANE                                        3 \nmid-thirties, good-looking, athletic and tired from his trip. He sits by the window.  His relief on landing is subtle, but we NOTICE.  Suddenly, he hears -- \nSALESMAN'S VOICE You don't like flying, do you? \nMcClane turns, looks at the Babbit clone next to him.  Caught, he tenses, holds his armrests in exaggerated fear. \nMCCLANE No, no, where'd you get that idea? \nSALESMAN (smiling) Ya wanna know the secret of successful air travel?  After you get where you're going, ya take off your shoes and socks. Then ya walk around on the rug barefoot and make fists with your toes. \nMCCLANE Fists with your toes. \nSALESMAN Maybe it's not a fist when it's your toes...I mean like this...work out that time zone tension. (demonstrating) Better'n a cup of coffee and a hot shower for the old jet lag.  I know it sounds crazy.  Trust me.  I've been doing it for nine years. \nThe plane stops.  Passengers rise, start to take down overhead luggage.  McClane does this, but as he opens the door above, the businessman BLANCHES seeing: \n3-A     HIS P.O.V. - MCCLANE'S BARETTA PISTOL                  3-A \nPeeking out from his jacket. \n3-B     BACK TO SCENE                                          3-B \nRecognizing the look, McClane smiles reassuringly. \nMCCLANE It's okay. (showing badge) I'm a cop. (pause) Trust me.  I've been doing it for eleven. \nThe businessman relaxes, moves off.  McClane now wrestles down the biggest Teddy Bear FAO Schwartz had to offer.  Balancing this, he moves down to another overhead, takes out a topcoat and an overnighter.  Barely managing all this, he turns, COLLIDING WITH: \n3-C     A PRETTY STEWARDESS                                    3-C \nShe bumps noses with the bear, gives a look. \nSTEWARDESS (smiling, about the bear) Maybe you should have bought her a ticket. \nMCCLANE Her? \nHe scrutinizes the nether regions of the bear, shrugs. \nMCCLANE She doesn't complain. \nSTEWARDESS (eying him) Neither would I. \nMcClane smiles, with just enough of a sigh to know he's as wistful about things-that-might-have-been as she is...moves down the aisle. \nCUT TO: \n4       INT. THE NAKATOMI BUILDING (LOS ANGELES) - EVENING     4 \nTakagi smiles, leads the way.  As they approach Holly's office door, McClane notices the name there is -- again -- \"Gennero\". \nTAKAGI Holly went to the Vault room to FAX some documents...she should be back any... \n16      HOLLY'S OFFICE                                         16 \nEllis is behind the desk.  He's SNIFFLING and just as they come in he SWEEPS the back of the slick desktop with his hand. \nBoth McClane and Takagi catch on...but Takagi tries to hide his awareness. \nELLIS Ah...hi...I just had to make a quick call, and this was the nearest phone... \nTAKAGI (as Ellis rises) Ellis, this is John McClane... (with meaning) Holly's policeman? (to McClane) Ellis is in charge of International Acquisitions. \nMCCLANE (shaking hands with Ellis) That explains the recent deal with Bolivia. \nEllis REACTS, runs a checking finger under his nose. \nMCCLANE (sotto) Relax, Ellis.  I'm off duty. \nTAKAGI (eager to change the subject, to McClane) Can I get you anything?  Food?  Cake? Watered down champagne punch? \nMCCLANE (grinning) I'm fine. (looking through the glass) You throw quite a party.  I didn't know they had Christmas in Japan. \nTAKAGI Hey, we're flexible.  Pearl Harbor didn't work out, we got you with tape decks. \nMcClane laughs.  He likes this guy. \nELLIS Actually, it's kind of a double celebration.        * We closed a pretty big deal today and a lot of it was due to Holly. \nThe door OPENS.  Holly comes inside. \nHOLLY All set, Joe.  The contracts went over the wire, and -- (surprised) John...! \n16-A    MCCLANE AND HOLLY                                      16-A \nA moment.  Does the sound of the party stop for him?  We know it.  For her?  It's more cryptic.  We sure hope so. \nHOLLY (recovering) I was hoping you made that flight. \nJOHN (quietly) I was hoping you were hoping that. \nShe laughs, kisses him on the cheek.  Ellis notes the awkwardness. \nTAKAGI (to McClane) You wife's made for this business. She know how to drive a hard bargain. \nMCCLANE Yeah.  I remember our first date. \nELLIS Show him the watch. \nAs she hesitates: \nELLIS Go on, show him.  What're you, embarrassed? (to McClane) A little token of our appreciation for all her work. \nHe takes Holly's wrist, holds it up.  McClane smoothly takes the wrist away from Ellis, looks at the watch. \nMCCLANE Nice, but one of us is three hours out of sync.  I think it's me. (to Holly, pointedly) Is there a place I can wash up? \nHOLLY (happy for the excuse) Sure.  Follow me. \nThey go out.  Alone, Takagi's look at Ellis shows his disapproval of certain snow at Christmas. \nCUT TO: \n17      EXT. NAKATOMI - NIGHT                                  17 \nAn Emory freight truck turns off Olympic into the underground parking garage of Nakatomi. \n18      INT. PARKING GARAGE                                    18 \nIt goes down the ramp and passes Argyle's black limo.  The driver's seat is EMPTY. \n19      INT. LIMO - SAME                                       19 \nArgyle sits in the back seat hidden from the outside world by the tinted rear windows.  He is making a drink from the bar with the TV on and his rap music blasting from the cassette player, oblivious to the truck passing behind him. \n20      INT. PARKING GARAGE - SAME                             20 \nThe Emory truck stops in front of the service elevator on the next level down.  As the truck idles, the uniformed driver makes a note on his clipboard. \n21      INT. ELLIS' OFFICE - NIGHT                             21 \nTILT UP FROM McClane's BARE FEET.  He is clenching and unclenching his toes. \nMCCLANE (surprised, actually feeling tension decline) Son-of-a-bitch.  It works. \nHolly sits on the desk here, watches him remove his jacket, tie shirt, etc.  Begin to wash up in the private bath. \nHOLLY What are you doing? \nMCCLANE It's a long story.  You know, I think that Ellis has his eye on you. \nHOLLY That's okay... (pause) ... I have an eye on his private bathroom. \nMcClane starts to open the stairwell door to the Machine Floor when a NOISE above him gets his attention.  He moves silently up one flight to the roof.  Quietly, he cracks the door and looks out onto a Machine Floor on the lower level of the roof. \n61      MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                       61 \nThree terrorist, JAMES, ULI and HEINRICH, are unpacking the wooden crates we saw in the garage from the service elevator. It's not clear what they're doing but it seems very military like and ominously defensive.  Heinrich POINTS up to the ceiling and says something in German.  The others nod.  Heinrich starts to turn towards the CAMERA and: \n62      MCCLANE                                                62 \ncloses the door and slips back down the stairs. \n63      INT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BOARD ROOM FLOOR - NIGHT        63 \nHands enters, looks around.                                   * \nHANS                                 * And when Alexander saw the breadth of his domain, he wept.  For there were no more worlds to conquer. (to Takagi) The benefits of a classical education. \nHans admired a scale model of a bridge.  Behind him are       * photographs of the gorge where the bridge will be constructed. Karl and Tony listen.  Takagi watches. \nHANS It's beautiful.  I always enjoyed models as a boy.  The exactness, the attention to every foreseeable detail... perfection. \nTAKAGI (defensively) This is what this is about?  Out building project in Indonesia? Contrary to what you people think, we're going to develop that region... not 'exploit' it. \nHans straightens, looks hard at Takagi. \nHANS I believe you. (smiling) I read the article in Forbes.                       * \nTakagi looks confused.  Hans puts a friendly arm around Takagi's shoulders and guides him into the adjacent board room where Theo types in commands onto a built-in computer console. \nHANS Mr. Takagi, we could discuss industrialization of men's fashions all day, but I'm afraid my associate, Mr. Theo, has some questions for you. Sort of fill-in-the blanks questions actually... \nJUMP CUT: \n64      A COMPUTER SCREEN SPITS OUT:                          64 \nNAKATOMI CORPORATION. BOARD WORKSTATION. ENTER CENTRAL COMPUTER CODE KEY _ _ _ _. \n65      THEO                                                  65 \nsits fingers poised over the keyboard.  Hans sits opposite. Takagi stands like the accused at the foot of the table, has just read the screen, blurts: \nTAKAGI I don't have that code...! (beat; to Hans) You broke in here to access out computer?!?  Any information you could get -- they wake up in Tokyo in the morning, they'll change it! You won't be able to blackmail our executives or threaten -- \nHans barks him to silence: \nHANS SIT DOWN! \nTakagi complies.  Hans is abruptly compassionate and quiet. \nHANS Mr. Takagi...I'm not interested in your computer. (beat) I'm interested in the 640 million dollars in negotiable bearer bonds you have in you vault. \nON Takagi's reaction. \nHANS Yes...I know about them.  The code key is a necessary step in accessing the vault. \nTAKAGI You want...money?  What kind of terrorists are you? \nHANS (amused) Who said we were terrorists? \n65-A    MCCLANE - ENTERING THIS FLOOR                         65-A \nHe tiptoes along, gun held ready.  He can HEAR the MUMBLE of voices from the conference room, moves slowly towards it. \n65-B    CONFERENCE ROOM - RESUME                              65-B \nHans slowly takes out his Walther and his silencer.  He feels his silencer a moment, as if making a decision, then slips it back into his coat pocket. \nHANS (weighing the gun) The code key, please...? \nTAKAGI It's useless to you!  There's seven safeguards on our vault, and the code key is only one of them!  You'll never get it open! \nHans lifts the gun. \nHANS Then there's no reason not to tell it to us. \nTHEO (aside to Karl) I told you... \nKARL It's not over... \nHans gives them both a look like an annoyed schoolmaster, turns back to Takagi. \nHANS This is too nice a suit to ruin, Mr. Takagi.  I'm going to count to three.  There will not be a four.  Give me the code. \nHe cocks the gun: \nTAKAGI I don't know it!  get on a Goddamn jet to Tokyo and ask the chairman! I'm telling you!  You're just going to have to kill me -- \nHANS Okay. \nBANG!!  He pulls the trigger: \n66      OUT IN THE MUSEUM - MCCLANE                           66      * \nreacts as if shot. \n76      INT. NAKATOMI - GROUND FLOOR OPERATIONS ROOM - SAME   76 \nA fire alarm indicator light showing which floor has sounded the fire alarm -- suddenly begins flashing, emitting short, loud beeps.  Eddie, the terrorist in the guard's uniform and manning the station, immediately picks up his CB. \n77      32ND FLOOR - SAME                                     77 \nMcClane stands at windows looking Northward for fire trucks. Suddenly we SEE the flashing red lights of FOUR ENGINES in traffic two miles away. \nMCCLANE C'mon, baby...come to Papa.  I'm gonna kiss your Goddamn dalmatian. \n78      INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON HANS - SAME                78 \nHe rides the elevator back to the 30th floor with Tony. \nHANS (calmly, to Eddie on CB) Call 911, give them the name and badge number on your uniform and cancel the alarm...then disable the system. (looks across at Tony, presses talk button again) Eddie?  What floor did the alarm go off? \n78-A    MACHINE FLOOR                                         78-A \nThey've heard the alarm here, too.  Heinrich, Marco and       * Uli HEAR the alarm and continue their mysterious work. \n79      UNFINISHED FLOOR - SAME                               79 \nMcClane stands silhouetted against the window.  In the distance he can see another fire truck swing off Santa Monica onto Avenue of the Stars. \nSuddenly the red light on the first truck goes out, then on the second.  McClane watches in disbelief.  The trucks slow and turn down separate side streets, heading for home. \nMCCLANE (realizing) Son of a bitch... \nJust then the elevator bell rings and we HEAR the ELEVATOR DOORS OPEN.  A figure (Tony) slips into the shadows -- his machine gun drawn.  We MOVE WITH HIM FROM the elevator area until he reaches the light switch and throws it illuminating the entire floor.  McClane is gone. \n80      ON MCCLANE                                            80 \nunder a desk.  He takes in his options. \n81      HIS P.O.V.                                            81 \nThe feet of Tony.  They move slowly in his direction.  McClane Looks down the aisle next to the windows.  It leads to a series of cubicles at the other end of the floor and is a clear path if he can make it past Tony. \n82      TONY                                                  82 \nHe moves steadily toward the area where we saw McClane. \nTONY The fire has been called off, my friend.  No one is coming to help you.  You might as well come out and join the others. (fingers the trigger of his machine gun) I promise not to hurt you. \nMoving more confidently, he steps up to McClane's desk, then around it and fires a blast into the space.  It is empty.  As the SOUND OF THE MACHINE GUN FADES he listens and hears another SOUND -- a NOISE coming from the other end of the room near the cubicles. \nTony heads toward the noise.  Sensing a trap, he moves past each cubicle carefully, checking each office until he reaches the doorway of the last one.  The sound is just around the partition.  He tenses, then spins into the cubicle. \n83      TONY'S P.O.V.                                         83 \nA radial arm saw spins noisily. \n84      TONY                                                  84 \ngrins at his nervousness.  He moves to turn it off, not realizing the sound has buried the soft rustle of McClane, steps INTO FRAME behind him, McClane shoves his pistol barrel against Tony's temple. \nMCCLANE Freeze, Police...don't move or name your beneficiary. \nTony doesn't.  McClane cocks his Beretta.  Tony watches him calmly. \nTONY You won't hurt me. \nMCCLANE Yeah?  Why not? \nTONY (smug) Because you are a policeman.  There are rules for policemen. \nMCCLANE Yeah.  My Captain keeps telling me the same thing. \nMcClane suddenly PISTOL WHIPS Tony across the head.  Tony REELS, then swallows, worried for the first time. \nMCCLANE Let's go. \nSuddenly Tony spins to the side and McClane FIRES, but the big man's momentum slams McClane into a filing cabinet and sends his pistol into the hall. \nTony fires his machine gun, but McClane kicks him into the desk. \nHe locks his arms around the big man's neck in a hold that sends Tony reeling into the hall.  McClane holds on as they slam through several plastic board partitions.  They careen across the hall into the stairwell door, opening it, and crash into: \n85      STAIRWELL LANDING                                     85 \nthen down the concrete steps into the wall on the landing below. For a moment, both men lie still.  McClane, still holding onto Tony's neck, releases it and the man's head flops sickeningly to the side. \nFor a moment McClane just looks at the dead man.  Then, slowly, methodically, he begins to SEARCH HIM.  He turns all his pockets inside out, looks at his clothing labels, stares long and very hard at a California driver's license with Tony's picture on it.  He expertly examines the machine gun when a HISSING SOUND coming from somewhere attracts his attention. \nHe rises, moves cautiously to the source. \n85-A    NEW ANGLE                                             85-A \nIt's Tony's CB, which has fallen from the dead man's waist during the struggle.  McClane stares at it, formulating a plan. \nCUT TO: \n86      INT. 32ND FLOOR - NIGHT                               86 \nTotal darkness. \n92      MCCLANE                                               92 \ntakes out a coin.  A quarter.  He stops, switches to a nickel. Throws it into the void.  It is a full four seconds until we HEAR it \"CHING\" and bounce on concrete far below.  You don't have to be a mathematics whiz to know it's a long drop. \nMCCLANE Jesus... \nHe moves cautiously around a corner and we SEE a metal ladder leading up to a door marked PUMP ROOM.  Opening the door McClane enters a darkened: \n93      PUMP ROOM                                             93 \ndamp and full of pipes and goes to another door.  He cracks the door and looks out. \n94      MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                                      94 \nThe lower level of the roof.  Open and deserted.  Only a heliport above him is higher. \n95      30TH FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - HOLLY'S OFFICE - SAME    95 \nWIDEN as a FILING CABINET is FLUNG across the floor, drawers SLAMMING out, papers flying.  KARL has done this, and he's    * barely started.  He FLINGS a LAMP against a wall, PUNCHES a hole into the plaster.  Finally, Hans goes to him, lays controlling hands on the man's shoulder. \nHANS I know what you are feeling.  But this is not productive -- \nKARL (pushing him away) He was my only brother...my only family! (a flat statement) I want blood for my blood.  We search...now. \nHe starts to move.  Hans stops him. \nHANS (firmly) No.  Heinrich's team must finish planting the detonators...and Theo needs time on the vault.  After the                  * police come they'll waste hours trying to negotiate...that's when we search                 * for this man.  Until then...we do not alter the plan. \nKARL (quietly) And if he alters it...?                              * \nFor once Hands doesn't have an answer. \n95-A    HOSTAGES - AROUND THE CORNER                          95-A \nThey've heard the alarm, can see and sense the agitation among their captors.  Ellis slides over to Holly. \nELLIS What's happening? \nHOLLY They don't look happy...something's gone wrong. \nELLIS The police...? \nHOLLY (shaking her head) John. \nELLIS John?  Christ, he could fuck this whole thing up...what does he think he's doing? \nHOLLY How about his job? \nELLIS His 'job' is 3000 miles away.  Without him, they might let us go...at least we have a chance... \nHOLLY (quietly) Tell that to Mr. Takagi. \n96      EXT. ROOF - NIGHT                                     96 \nMcClane climbs to the heliport and leans against the leeward side of a wall surrounding it.  Shielded from wind, he pulls out the CB, turns to channel nine, and starts broadcasting. \nMCCLANE Mayday, Mayday!  Anyone!  Terrorists have seized and Nakatomi building and are holding 30 or more hostages! I say again -- \n97      OUT                                             OUT   97 \n98      INT. HANS' OFFICE - SAME                              98 \nHans, Karl, Fritz and France hear the clear signal over Hans' CB. \nMCCLANE'S VOICE -- unknown number of terrorists, six or more, armed with automatic weapons at Nakatomi, Century City... Somebody answer me, Goddamnit! \nKarl looks almost...satisfied. \nHANS The roof.  It's the best place to transmit. \nThey move. \n99      INT. LOS ANGLES EMERGENCY DISPATCH CENTER - SAME      99 \nA SUPERVISOR weaves her way back from the break room toward a DISPATCHER who is monitoring the call. \nDISPATCHER It's the same address as that fire signal --                                            * \nSUPERVISOR (frowning) -- the false alarm?  I'll handle                     * it. \nShe plugs in her headset.  (Her condescending, arrogant tone is like the one in the famous tape where the dispatch lady spends so much time on red tape that the patient dies.) \nSUPERVISOR (into mike) Attention, whoever you are.  This channel is reserved for emergency calls only -- \nMCCLANE'S VOICE No fucking shit, lady!  Do I sound like I'm ordering a pizza? \n100     OUT                                             OUT  100 \n101     INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - ON KARL - SAME               101 \nwith Franco and Fritz. \nFRANCO No, but he's in the elevator shaft. \nHANS' VOICE Prefect.  The elevators are locked off.              * He can't escape.  Just shut him in and return to base. \nKARL Hans, he killed by brother -- \nHANS (more firmly) Karl, I know you want him, but the police are probably on their way. Maybe we can convince them it was all a mistake, but not if they hear gunshots! If you lock him in he'll be neutralized -- now do it!  Karl?  Karl! \nKarl turns off his radio.  In the light of their flashlights, the two other terrorists look at Karl in stunned disbelief. He opens the door to the elevator shaft. \n109-B   INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - ON MCCLANE                      109-B \nHe's OVERHEARD enough of this to realize he's in deep shit. He backtracks to the air shaft door, strikes a cigarette lighter. \n110-    OUT                                             OUT   110- \n117-A   ELEVATOR SHAFT (OPPOSITE SIDE)                        117-A \nKarl steps off the ladder to the catwalk, his own gun held    * ready. \n118     MCCLANE                                               118 \nHEARING Karl's approach, McClane thinks fast, looks down at his narrow confines, and then at: \n118-A   HIS WEAPON                                            118-A \nand its canvas gunsling and metal strap slides. \n118-B   BACK TO SCENE                                         118-B \nQuickly, McClane lets out all the slack in the sling.  Then, he BRACES the weapon across the outside opening of the air shaft door and lowers himself into the: \n119     AIR SHAFT                                             119 \nmeanwhile holding onto the canvas sling with his elbows bent over it like a kid doing a half-asses skin-the-cat on a swing set. \nHis feet slowly move down the smooth aluminum walls until they reach the top of the air duct, then DANGLE in the open space. He straightens his arms to give him length enough to touch the bottom edge of the duct. \nSuddenly he FEELS something GIVE above him and looks up. \n120     CLOSE ON THE SLING                                    120 \nIt was designed to carry a gun on a man, not vice versa.  The few inches of extra canvas are sliding through the clips. When they're gone...he will be too. \n121     KARL                                                  121 \nHe moves silently toward the corner. \n122     CLOSE - MCCLANE'S TOES                                122 \nnow only inches from the bottom edge.  McClane's arms are fully extended now.  He hears Karl on the metal catwalk.  His muscles strain and quiver. \n123     THE SLING                                             123 \nOne of the canvas end slips through the clip. \n124     ON MCCLANE                                            124 \nFALLING.  He grabs the ledge of the air duct as he falls and his body slams into the aluminum wall with an echoing BOOM. Above him on the catwalk the rifle rattles on the metal outside the door. \n125     ON KARL                                               125 \nAround the corner Karl FREEZES, unsure of the sound: \n126     ON MCCLANE                                            126 \nholding onto the ledge by his hands.  With every ounce of strength he tries to pull himself up into the horizontal duct, clawing for a hold. \n127     ON KARL                                               127 \nHe rounds the corner and sees McClane's rifle lying beneath the doorway.  He moves to the small door, shines his light and aims his rifle down into the air shaft ready to fire. \n128     HIS P.O.V.                                            128 \nThe shaft is deserted.  Moving his light around he sees the air duct.  Without hesitation he turns and backtracks to the pump room door. \n129     INT. AIR CONDITIONING DUCT - ON MCCLANE - SAME        129 \nHe lies exhausted and motionless in the narrow crawl space.  He awkwardly fishes out the lighter from his shirt pocket and thumbs it ON. \nThe flickering GLOW shows him this ain't no place for claustrophobics -- it's a long, long long dark and narrow corridor full of weird shadows.  The far end (if there even if one?) is BLACK. \nMCCLANE Whew...for a moment there I was worried. \nHe turns out his lighter, and starts crawling. \n130-    OUT                                             OUT   130- \n133-A   INT. MACHINE FLOOR                                    133-A \nThe three terrorists rush down from the roof in hot pursuit, Karl leading the way through the door.  Karl points quickly to the left and right where there are a series of rooms.  The others checks these while Karl approaches the CAMERA, trigger finger ITCHING.  Almost immediately, the others return. \nFRANCO (a whisper) Nothing. \nEddie picks up his CB.  He watches Powell coming up the stairs. \nEDDIE (to CB) Had a feeling you'd be calling... \nHANS' VOICE Let him in. \nEddie is a little startled, but he moves quickly. \n149-A   ALEXANDER                                             149-A \nalso hears this, and his eager expression fades.  But orders are orders. \n150     EXT. FRONT DOOR OF NAKATOMI - SAME                    150 \nPowell tries the front doors.  Locked.  Eddie comes hustling across and unlocks the door with the magnetic card. \nEDDIE Evening, officer.  What's up? \nPowell steps in and looks around.  Bland HOLIDAY MUZAK filters from Speakers here.   (LET IT SNOW)                           * \nPOWELL We got an emergency call that there was a problem here. \n151     INT. 34TH FLOOR - BOARD ROOM - SAME                   151     * \nMcClane makes his way to the Avenue of the Stars side of the building, enters the board room where Takagi was shot. McClane goes to the windows and looks down at the street. \n152     HIS P.O.V.                                            152 \nPowell's car. \nMCCLANE All right! \nMcClane waits, expectant.  Five seconds.  Ten seconds.  But no commotion, no shouting.  He frowns. \nMCCLANE Where's the fucking cavalry? \n152-A   INT. LOBBY - SAME TIME                                152-A \nPowell walks casually across the slick floor, eyes panning the area.  Eddie sits casually watching a game on one of his monitor screens. \nEDDIE We already had that false alarm, you ask me, the Goddamn computers sent you out on another wild goose chase. They been chasing bugs in that system since they installed it. (to the screen) Oh, shit, come on, I got fifty bucks on you assholes -- ! \nPowell's face shows us he's starting to think he's wasting his time. \n152-B-  OUT                                             OUT   152-B \n153-A   WITH MCCLANE                                          153-A \nThe silent tension is driving him crazy. \nMCCLANE Come on, come on...who's in that car, Stevie Wonder? \nHe makes up his mind.  He lifts one of the big chairs and swings it at the window.  The tempered glass whitens on the first blow. \n153-B   EXT.

Both men react, but Marco already has his gun up.  He FIRES a round at McClane.  The bullets rip into the table top and the chair, and McClane goes down behind the table. \n156-    OUT                                             OUT  156- 156-A                                                        156-A \n157     INT. 34th FLOOR - BOARD ROOM                         157 \nMarco smiles and moves around to the other side of the table, but finds no one.  He looks around frantically than squats beneath the table and sees: \n158     MCCLANE                                              158 \nlying prone, his pistol trained on him. \nMCCLANE Drop it or you're a rugstain. \n159     BOARD ROOM DOORWAY                                   159 \nJust then Heinrich, the terrorist steps into the doorway, sees the situation. \nHEINRICH Marco, duck! \nMarco dives sideways, but Heinrich still isn't quick enough. McClane FIRES TWICE and Heinrich DROPS sprawling in the hallway, machine gun FIRING BLINDLY until he hits the floor. \nTHORNBURG Mary, this is Dick.  I want a remote truck and a crew to meet me at the South gate in fifteen minutes... (listens) Damn right, fifteen... (listens) Where are we going? (Hearing gun shots) For an Emmy! \nNow, hearing MACHINE GUN FIRE, Thornburg hangs up the second phone.  Runs out of the room.  CAMERA PANS BACK TO the first phone. \nWOMAN'S VOICE Richard?  Richard? \n167     EXT. CENTURY CITY - NIGHT                            167 \nSirens wail as the first few police cars arrive.  Powell sees them, waves them back, points to the third floor. \n168     INT. HOSTAGE WING - ON ELLIS - SAME                  168 \nHe leans back and closes his eyes, luxuriating in the sound of WAILING POLICE SIRENS.

We knew that police action was inevitable... (an odd smile) ...In fact, it's necessary.  So let them start their feeble efforts; until them, stay calm.  We have the hostages, remember.  We are still in charge. \nSuddenly Hans' CB crackles to life. \nHANS (picking it up) I told all of you...I want radio silence until further -- \nINTERCUT: \n169-A   MCCLANE - 34th FLOOR - BOARD ROOM                    169-A    * \nHe's got a CB on the table and ON, and his cop's notebook is out again.  He's already upgraded the NUMBER OF TERRORISTS? to \"12 (?) minus 3 = 9\" and added other information.  As he speaks he takes ammo clips the dead men dropped, their sidearms, etc. \nMCCLANE Gee, I'm sorry, Hans, nobody gave me the message.  You shoulda put it on the bulletin board.  Anyway, I thought you and Franco and Karl and the other boys might be lonely, now that I waxed Tony and Marco and their buddy.  So I invited some of the guys from my card game. \nIn the office, the terrorists REACT, startled, as McClane name-drops. \nFRANCO                                * How...how does he know so much about -- \nHANS (waving for silence) Ah, how nice of you to call.

Now armed with Marco's machine gun and carrying Heinrich's kit bag, he seems more lethal.    * \nMCCLANE (into CB) BZZZ!  Sorry, Hans, wrong guess. Would you like to go for Double Jeopardy, where the stakes are double and the scores really change? \nHe rolls Heinrich over and is delighted to find a pack of Gauloise's in the man's pocket.  He takes them, pats the      * dead man's face. \nMCCLANE (sotto, to the body) Bad for your health anyway. \nHANS Who are you, then? \nMCCLANE Just the fly in the ointment, Hans. The monkey in the wrench, the pain in the ass - \nMcClane STOPS in mid-speech.  He's just opened the kit bag Heinrich had over his shoulder when he died.  Now McClane takes out the contents...dozens and dozens of EXPLOSIVE DETONATORS marked \"DANGER\" and a CHUNK of cello-wrapped PLASTIQUE the size of an electric razor.  He WHISTLES in surprise to himself. \nIn the office, Hans turns off his mike for a moment, turns to Karl.                                                      * \nHANS Check on all the others...don't use the radio.

Meanwhile, McClane   * SMILES at the tell-tale STATIC as Hans goes off and on.  He knows what's happening.  Now, he starts to walk down a corridor, eyes PANNING FROM elevator to the stairwell doors. \nHANS Mr. Mystery Guest.  Are you still there? \nMCCLANE I wouldn't think of leaving, Hans. Unless you want to open the front door...? \nHANS I'm afraid not.  But you have me at a loss -- you know my name, but who are you? (scornfully) Just another American who saw too many movies as a child.  Another orphan of a bankrupt culture who thinks he's John Wayne...Rambo... Marshal Dillion. \nMCCLANE Actually, I was always partial to Roy Rogers.  I really dug those sequined shirts. \nHANS (harsh) Do you really think you have a chance against us, Mr. Cowboy? \nA LIGHT blinks on the elevator. \nMCCLANE (long pause) Yipee-yi-yea...mother-fucker. \nMcClane goes quietly through the stairwell door and is gone by the time the search party steps onto this floor. \nHans sits quietly...thinking. \n170-A   OUT                                             OUT   170-A \nCUT TO: \n171     INT. 30TH FLOOR - SAME                                171 \nKarl steps off the elevator and goes through the crowd of hostages to Hans. \nKARL (quietly) He wasn't lying about Marco:  He's thirty stories down on the street. The other man is Heinrich, and I found his body upstairs. (pause; Hans looks alarmed) And his bag is missing. \nHANS He had the detonators! (into CB) Theo?

He can't see a thing because of the lights. \nMCCLANE (to himself) No... \n195     EXT. POLICE BARRICADES - ON MITCHELL AND ROBINSON     195 \nSuddenly rifle fire sounds from the building. \nROBINSON (worriedly) They're shooting at them \nMITCHELL (calmly) It's panic fire...they can't see anything. \nPOWELL (under breath) They're shooting at the lights. \nMore shots ring out from the building going over the SWAT officers' heads and suddenly the huge dome of one of the spotlights shatters behind Mitchell and Robinson's head. The glow fades.  A moment later the next light twenty feet away dies. \nROBINSON They're going after the lights! \nThe two SWAT officers cutting the garage ate suddenly look up as their cover starts to disappear. \nROBINSON Call them back. \nMITCHELL No, they're almost in. \nSuddenly the third and fourth lights are shot out and the SWAT men become sitting ducks. \n196     IN HOLLY'S OFFICE - HANS                              196 \nHe calmly speak into his CB. \nHANS Don't get impatient.

At the window, they prepare the weapon for use. \nOutside the window the armored car has stopped in front of the wounded man and paramedics quickly load them in from the sheltered side of the vehicle.  Alexander quickly sights on the armored car. \nALEXANDER (to Hans, CB) I have them \nHANS' VOICE (o.s., over CB) Fire. \n202     EXT.

The car pitches forward like a beast whose front legs have been shot out from under it -- its front axle destroyed, unable to move.  Alexander looks back at James and grins. \n203     30TH FLOOR - HANS                                     203 \nHe watches from his window.

Are you sure? \nBefore Powell can answer Robinson comes running up to him. \nROBINSON Is that him? \nPOWELL Yessir. \nROBINSON (reaching for Powell's CB) Give me that. (angrily at McClane) Now, listen to me, mister, I don't know what you think you're doing, but demolishing a building doesn't fall under the definition of 'help'! There's hundreds of people out here and you covered half of them in pieces of glass -- \nMCCLANE Glass, my ass!  Who the fuck is this? \nROBINSON This is Deputy Chief of Police Dwayne T. Robinson, and I'm in charge of this situation. \nMcClane leans tiredly against the elevator door. \nMCCLANE Well, from up here, it looks like you're in charge of shit, Dwayne. I haven't seen such a fucked up operation since the Bride of Frankenstein.  Ask the guys in the armored car if they minded a little flying glass. \nROBINSON Listen asshole -- ! \nMCCLANE (exploding) Asshole?  I'm not the one who just for butt fucked on national TV, Dwayne!  Now if you're not part of the solution, stop being part of the problem!  Get off the Goddamn radio and put Al back on! \nMcClane is so furious, he's out of breath. \n226     INT.

We're in the studio set. \nGAIL (as the picture stabilizes) ...of the Nakatomi building, sources say that the terrorist leader 'Hans' may be this man, Hans Gruber. \nA SLIDE of Hans appears behind her.  At the same time, the CAMERA PULLS BACK.  We realize we're on THE HOSTAGE FLOOR, and Hans has just turned on the set out here for his \"guests\".  He smiles modestly as they \"recognize\" him from the on air shot, returns to the office. \nGAIL (on TV) A member of the radical West German Volksfrei movement. Strangely, the Volksfrei leadership issued a communique an hour ago stating that Gruber has been expelled from the organization and is operating on his own. \nHARVEY (on TV) Obviously, Gail whatever his affiliation, it's safe to say that Gruber's terrorist actions in Los Angeles tonight are well, terroristic... \nAs the bullshit continues, Ellis suddenly STANDS, head towards the terrorist \"office\".  Immediately the chief guard here, Fritz, moves to intercept Ellis. \nHOLLY Where are you going? \nELLIS I'm tired of sitting here waiting to see who gets us killed first... them...or your husband. (to the approaching Fritz) Hi there. \nHOLLY (worried) What are you going to do? \nELLIS Hey, I negotiate million dollar deals for breakfast.  I can handle these clowns. (to Fritz) I want to talk to Hans.  Hans! Sprickenzie talk? \nHe doesn't wait for an answer.  Fritz follows him.

Ellis is there. \nELLIS Hope I'm not interrupting...? \nHANS (to Fritz) What does he want? \nAs Fritz shrugs: \nELLIS It's not what I want, it's what I can give you.  Look, let's be straight, okay?  It's obvious you're not some dumb thug up here to snatch a few purses, am I right? \nKarl looks at Ellis and then at Hans, as if to say, let me plug this asshole right now.  But Hans is either amused of curious or bored enough to shake his head, turn back to Ellis. \nHANS (politely) You're very perceptive. \nELLIS' VOICE John, didn't you hear me? \nMCCLANE (to CB, quietly) Yeah, I hear you, you fucking moron! \nELLIS John, I think you could get with the program a little.  The police are here now.  It's their problem. Tell these guys where the detonators are so no one else gets hurt.  Hey, I'm putting my life on the line for you buddy... \nMCCLANE Don't you think I know that!  Put Hans on!  Hans, listen to me, that shithead doesn't know what kind of scum you are, but I do -- \nHANS Good.  Then you'll give us what we want and save your friend's life. You're not part of this equation. It's time to realize that. \nSaying this, Hans takes out his gun, points it at Ellis, smiling. Ellis smiles, too. \nELLIS What am I, a method actor?  Hans, babe, put away the gun.  This is radio, not television... \nMCCLANE That asshole's not my friend! I barely know him!  I hate his fucking guts -- (desperately sincere) -- Ellis, for Christ's sake, tell him you don't mean shit to me -- \nELLIS John, how can you say that, after all these years--?  John?  John? \nEllis looks at Hans and shrugs, \"Well, I tried...\" Hans nods understandingly.  He takes the CB, presses the TALK button, and in one frighteningly smooth motion brings the Walther up to Ellis' forehead and PULLS THE TRIGGER. \nCUT TO: \n237     INT. 33RD FLOOR - MCCLANE                            237 \nHe was expecting the SHOT but it still chills him. \n238     30TH FLOOR - HOLLY AND HOSTAGES                      238 \nShe lowers her head sadly.  Around her, the others go CRAZY as they SEE Ellis' blood splattered on the glass walls on Hans' office. \n239     INT. HANS' OFFICE - ON HANS                         239 \nHe throws open the door to let McClane and the police hear the screams of the hostages. \nHANS Hear that?  Talk to me, where are my detonators.  Where are they or shall I shoot another one?  Sooner or later... (taking a shot) ...I might get to someone you do care about. \nMCCLANE (after a beat) Go fuck yourself. \nHe DISCONNECTS. \n240     EXT. BUILDING                                       240 \nPowell fends off Robinson, who wants the CB. \nROBINSON Goddamn, didn't you hear him!  He practically pulled the Goddamned trigger himself -- he gave that man to them -- \nPOWELL Christ, can't you read between the lines!  He did everything he could to save him...if he gave himself up they'd both be dead! \nROBINSON Maybe.  And maybe they'd at least be talking to us!  Now tell your 'partner' to stay out of it, or so help me if he lives through this I'll put him behind bars myself! \nPOWELL (amused) He's alone, tired, hunted, and hasn't seen diddly-squat from us and you think he gives a flying fuck about what you're going to do to him? Robinson, wake up and smell the shit you're shoveling! \nROBINSON (cold) Anytime you want to go home, Sergeant...consider yourself dismissed. \nThey lock eyes. \nPOWELL No Sir.  You couldn't drag me away. \nHANS' VOICE (over CB) Attention police.  Attention police. \nIt's asses and elbows time.  Tape recorders are started. \nPOWELL (starting to speak) This is -- \nROBINSON (taking the CB away) This is Deputy Chief Robinson.  Who is this? \nINTERCUT: \n241     HANS' OFFICE                                         241 \nHANS This is Hans Gruber.  I assume you realize the futility of direct action against me.  We have no wish for further loss of life. \nROBINSON What do you wish for, Mister Gruber? \nHANS I have comrades in arms around the world who are languishing in prison. The American State Department enjoys rattling its saber to its own ends... now it can rattle it for me. \nINTERCUT: \n242     MCCLANE                                              242 \nListening to this with expressions ranging from astonishment to dismay to outright derisive amusement. \nHANS' VOICE ...The following people are to be released from their captors:  In Northern Ireland, the seven members of the New Provo Front.  In Canada, the five imprisoned leaders of Liberte de Quebec... \n243     HANS' OFFICE                                         243 \nHANS ...in Sri Lanka, the nine members of the Asian Dawn movement... \nKARL (sotto) 'Asian Dawn Movement?' \nHANS (off-mike, a shrug) I read about them in Time magazine. (on mike) When these Revolutionary Brothers and Sisters are Free, the hostages in this building will be taken to the roof and they will accompany us in helicopters to the Los Angeles International Airport where you will be given further instructions.  You have two hours to comply. \nROBINSON Two hours?  Are you insane?  I can't authorize...hello?  Hello? \nAs Robinson REACTS, we GO TO: \n257     THE MECHANICAL FLOOR - TIGHT ON HANS                   257 \nHe checks the plastique, not pleased.  He turns, DROPS to the floor. \n258     LOW ANGLE                                              258 \nHe lands, knees bent...looks directly at a PAIR OF BARE FEET. A GUN BARREL DROPS INTO THE SHOT close to his head. \nMCCLANE Lost? \n259     NEW ANGLE                                              259 \nA moment.  And then Hans turns, looks up. \nThe transformation in his expression and bearing are mind- boggling.  Hands shaking, eyes filled with fear, he swallows, looks up at McClane and in a perfect American accent says: \nHANS --ohGodplease -- don't kill me -- don't kill me -- you're one of them, I know it -- \nMCCLANE (thrown, unsure) Whoa, whoa, easy man.  I won't hurt you.  Who are you?  What are you looking for? \nHans' eyes dart towards: \n260     THE BUTTRESS TEN FEET AWAY                             260 \nWhere a tiny piece of his gun sticks out, barely visible. \n261     BACK TO SCENE                                          261 \nHANS A way up to the roof...I thought I could signal for help -- \nHe starts in that direction. \nMCCLANE Forget it.  They got a guy up there. You want to stay alive, keep moving. Hey?  You hear me? \nHans realizes this tack won't work.  He follows McClane. \nHANS You...you're an American? \nMCCLANE (friendly, easing the man's fears) Only if New Jersey counts. \nIt works.  The poor frightened civilian shows a hint of a smile. \nCUT TO: \n261-A   OUTSIDE BUILDING                                       261-A \nROBINSON (in mid-speech to FBI) We've got thirty, maybe thirty-five hostages, probably on the 30th floor... seven, maybe eight terrorists. \nLITTLE JOHNSON (to Big Johnson) Sounds like a standard A-7 scenario. \nBig Johnson nods in agreement, turns to Robinson. \nBIG JOHNSON Thank you.  We'll handle it from here.  When we need to commandeer your men, we'll try and let you know. \nHe starts to move away with his partner. \nPOWELL (angry) Aren't you forgetting something? \nJohnson and Johnson turn.  Robinson wants Powell to shut up. \nBIG JOHNSON Such as...? \nPOWELL (pointing to the building) John McClane!  He's the man who gave us all the information we've got! He's the reason you're facing seven terrorists instead of twelve. \nLITTLE JOHNSON He's inside?  Who is he? \nROBINSON (nodding) He may be a cop...we're checking on that -- \nBIG JOHNSON One of yours? \nROBINSON (too quickly) No, sir. \nBIG JOHNSON (after a moment) If he's not a terrorist, and he's not a hostage...he's just not part of the equation. \nThey start to walk away. \nPOWELL (indignant) T...that's the same Goddamn thing the terrorists said! \nLITTLE JOHNSON (interested) Really? (to Big Johnson) That's one good thing.  Sound like we're dealing with pros. \nThey leave. \nCUT TO: \n262     THE COMPUTER FLOOR                                     262 \nMcClane and Hans walk together.  Hans is still a \"nervous wreck.\" \nHANS (nodding) There was a party -- celebration -- all of a sudden they were there -- shooting -- threatening us -- \n263     CLOSER SHOT                                            263 \n275     FRANCO                                               275 \nMcClane's bullets RAKE his middle, throw him over a desk, his weapon FLYING: \n276     CLOSER                                               276 \nHe SLIDES right into a glass door.

He turns: \n278     HANS                                                 278 \nhas reappeared and snatched up Franco's weapon. \n279     MCCLANE                                              279 \nFIRES, moving, trying to keep from bring flanked.  One of his shots SHATTERS a glass panel, raining down shards near Hans, who escapes with only superficial scratches. \n280     HANS                                                 280 \nlooks at the glass around him, gets an idea.  He SHOUTS to Karl in German: \nHANS The glass!  Shoot the glass! \nAnd, saying this, he demonstrates.  Karl follows suit. \n281     MCCLANE                                              281 \nas GLASS FLIES EVERYWHERE, McClane sees one option, takes it. BLASTING a burst to keep their heads down, he WHIRLS, JUMPS on top of a long counter and RUNS ACROSS THE ROOM.  Their BULLETS follow him, six inches behind his moving form!  Big CRAY UNITS GROAN with electronic SQUEALS and SPARKS as a million Gigabytes goes to RAM heaven.  McClane reaches the end of the counter, DIVES and rolls to the floor: \n282     HIS FOOT                                             282 \ngoes right down on a jagged SHARD.

Thornburg looks up from his danish, a cute little chin napkin protecting his shirt collar. \nTHORNBURG You got something? \nMARY (waving a paper) Just McClane's name, badge number, police record, vital statistics... (the ringer) ...And his family's address right here in L.A. \nAs Thornburg GRINS we GO TO: \n286     HOSTAGE FLOOR                                         286 \nEddie and Uli are guarding the hostages.

Shocked, McClane DIVES out of the way of the bullets that stitch across the door. \n349     HOSTAGES - ON LOWER FLOORS (OR IN STAIRWELL)          349 \ndescending, SCREAMING and HOWLING as a chopper SWEEPS past a window on a loop back towards the roof. \n350     IN THE CHOPPER                                        350 \nBoth Johnsons FIRE AWAY \nBIG JOHNSON Bank and we'll nail him! \n351     THE VAULT ROOM                                        351 \nHans whirls towards Kristoff. \nHANS Blow the roof.

Desperate, he looks around, see a fire hose.  Makes up his mind.  With the chopper LOOMING UP behind him, he slings Uli's weapon, runs to the fire hose, unreels three yards, loops it around his back and under his legs. He looks over the edge, hesitates: \nMCCLANE Fuck this... \nBullets HIT all around him.  He JUMPS: \n353     THE VAULT ROOM                                        353 \nHans extends the antenna...HITS the button. \n354     LONG SHOT - THE ROOF                                  354 \nThe helipad EXPLODES!

He takes the bullet from the rifle clip, adds it to the Baretta clip.  He slams the pistol clip back, really worried. Mind racing, he looks all around the room...his eyes fall on a tape dispenser.  He thinks again...steps towards it: \n380-A   IN THE BASEMENT                                       380-A \nTheo has pulled two ramps out from the truck and slips into the back.

Hans hangs onto Holly while Eddie pushes the mail carts of moneybags.  Kristoff goes to the door to scope their escape...suddenly he is COLD COCKED by a rifle butt. \n385     WIDER                                                 385 \nMcClane steps into view in the doorway, backlit by sparks still tumbling down from the roof above.  He holds the machine gun ready. \nMCCLANE Hans! \nHans turns, not that surprised.  Grinning, he yanks Holly into view.  No words need be said. \nHOLLY John! \nMCCLANE Holly, we have to stop meeting like this. (taking in the vault) So that's what it was.  A fucking robbery. (thinking) So why nuke the building, Hans? \nHANS (with a shrug) When you steal six hundred dollars, you can disappear...but when you steal six hundred million, they will find you...unless you play dead. (tight smile) Which happens to be your next role... drop your gun, please. \nMcClane hesitates...Hans pushes the gun against Holly again, really hurting her.  Eddie quickly raises his weapon. \nHANS (to Eddie) Nein, dies ein ist mein. (to McClane) This time John Wayne does not walk off into the sunset with Grace Kelly. \nMCCLANE That was Gary Cooper, shithead... \nHANS No more jokes, drop it or she gets it between the eyes! \nMCCLANE (slowly putting down his gun) Whoa, Hans, now you're the cowboy? \nHANS 'Yippe-ki-yea, mother fucker'?  Now you are fucked. \nHe aims: \nMCCLANE Holly, now...! \nInstantly, Holly sidesteps, JABS her elbow into Hans' face! \n386     MCCLANE - OVER SHOULDER SHOT                          386 \nAt the same moment Holly moves, McClane grabs his Baretta from its hiding place TAPED TO THE BACK OF HIS NECK, SHOOTS Hans high in the chest! \nThe bullet passes right THROUGH Hans, and the WINDOW behind him SPLATTERS with blood and SHATTERS.  Even while this is happening, McClane SPINS: \n387     EDDIE - THROUGH MCCLANE'S WIDESPREAD LEGS             387 \nEddie takes a gunshot, DROPS just like on Gunsmoke. \n388     BACK TO SCENE                                         388 \nHans drops his weapon, staggers, looks down at his own blood in shock. \n389     MCCLANE                                               389 \nMCCLANE You were right about us Americans.

He REELS, falls against the windowsill, starts to TOPPLE -- and then he GRITS his teeth and from some inward place finds a last reserve of strength and he GRABS: \n391     HOLLY'S WRIST                                         391 \nand she is YANKED off her feet! \n392     BACK TO SCENE                                         392 \nHans goes out the window, pulling Holly with him!

He scowls at Argyle. \nARGYLE The girl was off today.  Hey, I didn't expect you to sit up front. (back to the topic) So, your lady live out here? \nMCCLANE The past six months. \nARGYLE (thinking about that) Meanwhile, you still live in New York? \nMCCLANE You're nosey, you know that, Argyle? \nARGYLE Hey, I'm sorry.  When I was a cabdriver, see, people expected a little chit chat, a little eccentricity and comaraderie, I forgot how stuck up you limo guys were, so excuse me. \nMCCLANE (amused) It's okay, it's okay. \nARGYLE (instantly) So, you divorced of what? \nMcClane gives up. \nMCCLANE She had a good job, it turned into a great career. \nARGYLE But meant her moving here. \nMCCLANE Closer to Japan.  You're fast. \nARGYLE So, why didn't you come? \nMCCLANE 'Cause I'm a New York cop who used to be a New York kid, and I got six months backlog of New York scumbags I'm still trying to put behind bars. I don't just get up and move. \nARGYLE (to the point) You mean you thought she wouldn't make it out here and she'd come crawling on back, so why bother to pack? \nMcClane grins, he like Argyle even if he is direct. \nMCCLANE Like I said, Argyle...you're fast. \nARGYLE (popping in a cassette) Mind if I play some tunes? \nA hard RAP SONG blasts from the speakers. \nMCCLANE How 'bout some Christmas music? \nARGYLE That is Christmas music. \nAnd damned it if isn't, the Fat Boys of Run DMC doing a revisionist number on WHITE CHRISTMAS or something.

He gives the Guard a look...the Guard raises his eyebrows as if to say give it a try. \n13-A    SCREEN - CLOSER                                       13-A \nMcClane types, \"McClane, Holly\".

He rotates his head, getting out the travel cricks. \nAs he approaches the 30th floor we hear a tremendous THUMPING, THROBBING NOISE.  McClane stops and listens before he realizes -- it's the party.  As the doors open the noise ATTACKS us. \n15      30TH FLOOR - SAME                                      15 \nMcClane moves around the edge of the party, gradually spiraling inward.  He grabs a glass of Mimosa champagne punch from a passing tray, sips...scowls.  Spotting open beers in an ice bucket, he tosses the punch into a potted plant, even burying the plastic glass.  Sipping the beer, he moves through the dense party.  People he doesn't know throw streamers over him. \nA WOMAN kisses him.  He grins.  A MAN kisses him. \nMCCLANE (to himself, shaking his head) California... \nFinally he queries a DANCING WOMAN.  The MUSIC drowns out their words but she nods, points off in some generic direction. \nMcClane heads that way, cuts around a Christmas tree, loses his bearings.

It's out. \nMCCLANE Shit... \nHe looks out the window at: \n51-A    NEIGHBORING BUILDING - MCCLANE'S P.O.V.                51-A \nA high-rise apartment building a half-block away sparkles with lights.  McClane stares at a PRETTY GIRL in her bedroom.  She's wearing drop dead underwear right out of the Victoria's Secret catalog.  As we watch, she flops down on her bed, and with one long leg in the air, effortlessly dials a call on her high-tech phone.  It seems so easy. \n51-B    BACK TO SCENE                                          51-B \nFrustrated, he watches this, knits his brow. \nMCCLANE Think... \n52      INT. 30th FLOOR (HOSTAGE FLOOR) - SAME                 52 \nThe employees have been herded to the center of the room where the desks have been pulled back.  Many people are whimpering. \n52-A    HOLLY                                                  52-A \nShe looks around the room for McClane.  She's so intent on this that she doesn't see one TERRORIST waving her forward. Exasperated, he SHOVES her.  Her glare at him shows us her mettle. \n52-B    WIDER                                                  52-B \nAs the employees are bunched together, Ellis seeks out Holly. He's clearly scared but trying to fake courage.  He pats her hand \"reassuringly.\" \nHans steps up on top of a desk and looks over the group.  He reaches into a pocket...several people CRINGE...but what he comes out with is a Bottega Venata pocket notebook.  He checks his own scribblings like a dais speaker. \nHANS (soothing, in control) Ladies and gentlemen, due to the Nakatomi Corporation's legacy of greed around the globe, it is about to be taught a lesson on real power. You...will be witnesses. If our demands are not met, however -- (sad smile) -- You may become participants instead. (beat, checking notes) Now, where is...'Takagi'?  Where is the man who... (slight smile) ...used to be in charge here? \nTakagi is shoved forward.  He's worried but far from cowed. Hans steps towards him.  Extends a hand. \nHANS (quite civil) Mr. Takagi.  How do you do.  My name is Hans Gruber. \nTakagi is confused by his charm.  Hans waves politely in the direction of an elevator and with an armed escort takes the executive away.  CAMERA ADJUSTS to show Holly, concerned. \n56      INT. STAIRWELL - 33rd FLOOR - SAME                     56 \nMcClane pauses outside the stairwell door to the 33rd floor, he presses the handle and cracks the door open TO REVEAL a computer floor.  The computer machinery drones on under the lights behind plate glass windows.  McClane quietly closes the door and moves to another floor. \nMCCLANE (mumbling to himself) 32 construction...33 computers... \n57-     OUT                                              OUT   57- \n59      INT. SERVICE ELEVATOR - NIGHT                          59 \nHans, Takagi, Karl and Tony.  Riding silently.  Hans alone seems relaxed.  He whistles.  We recognize it as a snatch of Wagner. \nHANS Nice suit.  John Philips...London? \nTakagi stares at him, speechless. \nHANS (smiles) I have two myself. (beat, as he exits:) I'm told Arafat shops there too... \n60      INT.

He won't give us him name.  He appears to be the man who called in the report...he's killed one of the terrorists for sure and claims he capped two others. \nROBINSON (exasperated) He claims?  Powell, has it occured to you he could be one of the terrorists, pulling your chain? Or some kind of nut case who -- \nPOWELL I don't think so, Sir.  In fact... I think he's a cop.  Maybe not LAPD, but definitely a badge. \nROBINSON How do you know? \nPOWELL A hunch.  Things he said.  Like, knowing how to recognize a phony ID -- \nROBINSON (exasperated) -- recognizing phony ID's?  Christ, Powell, he could be a fucking bartender for all we know! \nSomething draws Robinson's attention.  He looks at: \n178     HIS P.O.V. - REMOTE NEWS TRUCK                        178 \nPulling up and parking just beyond the barricades. Richard Thornburg gets out, starts supervising the            * positioning of cameras. \n178-A   BACK TO SCENE                                         178-A \nROBINSON Oh shit... \n179     HOSTAGE FLOOR                                         179 \nHans examines building plans at Holly's desk.  Behind him the TV is ON, the sound muted.  TV cops triumph over oafish bad guys. \nHans looks up as Fritz brings in Holly. \nHOLLY I...have a request. \nHANS Oh?  What idiot put you in charge? \nHOLLY (evenly) You did. (on his look) You murdered by Boss.  Now... (waving towards the hostages) They're looking to me.  Personally I'd pass on the jab.  I don't enjoy being this close to you. \nHans is impressed by her candor.  And she's easy enough on the eyes. \nHANS Go on. \nHOLLY We have a pregnant woman out there -- (on his look) -- relax, she's not due for two weeks, but a marble floor isn't doing her back any good.  I'd like permission for her to more to one of the offices where there's a sofa. \nHANS No.  But I'll have a sofa brought out to you.  Good enough? \nHOLLY Good enough.  And unless you like is messy, you'd better start taking us in groups to the bathroom. \nHANS (nods) Yes, you're right.  It will be done. \nHe nods to one of his men, and she is waved to the door: \nAs she goes: \nHANS Mr. Takagi chose his people well, Mrs...? \nHOLLY Gennero.  Miss Gennero. \nHe nods, thoughtful.  She goes out.  Hans suddenly notices: \n180     CLOSER - TV                                          180 \nA slide \"SPECIAL BULLETIN\" has appeared.  This changes to a SHOT of the Nakatomi building with \"LIVE\" supered over it. Richard Thornburg is in front. The CAMERA TIGHTENS ON him. \nTHORNBURG This is Richard Thornburg, speaking to you live from Century City... where Los Angeles has joined the sad but world wide fraternity whose only membership requirement is the awesome spectre of International Terrorism... \n181     ANOTHER TV SCREEN - NIGHT                            181 \nAs Thornburg Continues, we PULL BACK.  We're WITH Argyle in the back seat of the limo. \nARGYLE (reaching for the remote) What else is new...? \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK and we SEE the Nakatomi Building rise up in the b.g. behind Thornburg. \nARGYLE (stunned) Holy shit... \nTHORNBURG We're told that the situation began some two hours ago when an unidentified party of men took over the building and sealed off all of its entrances and exits... \nArgyle is already bailing out of the car. \n182     EXT. LIMO - IN THE GARAGE                            182 \nArgyle looks at the metal gates, swallows.  He JUMPS back in the car. \n183     BACK INSIDE                                          183 \nArgyle pours himself a stiff drink. \nTHORNBURG (on TV) Since all the telephone lines have been cut, the only contact with the building had been through the use of CB communicators which the terrorists brought with them.  Strangely enough, so far the terrorists have not communicated directly with the police... but an unidentified man has had several conversations which seem to indicate... \nArgyle nearly spills his drink as he leans over the front seat and turns on the CB. \nCUT TO: \n184     OUTSIDE THE BUILDING - SAME TIME                     184 \n", "test3_true": "POWELL What's going on? \nROBINSON What's it look like?  We're going in. \nPOWELL (flabbergasted) Going in...are you out of your mind? There's 30 hostages in there -- for all we know -- \nROBINSON -- all we know?  We don't know shit, Powell.  If there's hostages why hasn't anyone asked for ransom?  If there's terrorists, where's their goddamn list of demands?  All we know is that someone shot up your car, and it could be the same flake you've been talking to on the radio! \nPOWELL What about the body that fell out of the window -- ? \nROBINSON Who the hell knows?  Maybe he was a stockbroker who looked at the Dow Jones and opted for early retirement! \nMITCHELL Chief, we're ready. \nROBINSON I'm coming. \nMITCHELL (into radio) Rivers. \nRIVERS (over radio) Yo. \nMITCHELL Begin your reconnoiter. \n185     MCCLANE                                               185 \nInside the building, sadly realizing that the Marlboro pack has only two more to go.  He savors the dregs of his current number, then suddenly becomes aware of an almost EERIE QUIET. He moves to the window. \n186     HIS P.O.V. - OUTSIDE                                  186 \nHints of activity in the darkness.  A LIGHT FLARES extinguished. Shadows move on trailer walls. \n187     BACK TO SCENE                                         187 \nMCCLANE (spooked, into CB) Powell?  Al, you still with me? What's going on?  Al? \nINTERCUT: \n188     OUTSIDE                                               188 \nPowell stiffens.  Robinson looks at him warningly, shakes his head. \nPOWELL I'm here, Roy, but I'm, uh, kind of busy.  Let's talk later, okay? \nMCCLANE Al, what's wrong?  Did something -- (realizing) -- Oh, God.  You're coming in!  That's it, isn't it?  Christ, Powell, I told you what you're dealing with here -- \nPOWELL I said we'll talk later, Roy.  If you're what I think you are you should know when to listen, when to shut up... and when to pray. \nHating himself, Powell DISCONNECTS, watches LIGHTS snaps on in the parking lot to illuminate the area. \nAlso hating himself, McClane does the same thing.  Pale, he moves to a window to watch what he knows is going to be brutal. \n188-A   IN HOLLY'S OFFICE - HANS                              188-A \nHe hunches over his communicator. \nHANS They'll be coming.  Get ready. Theo, watch the screens.  Be our eyes and ears. (pause) Wait until they're close. \n188-B   EDDIE                                                 188-B \nslips away from the desk, a computer card in his hand.  He meets up with another terrorist and they move behind a slit in the wall.  Eddie waves his card at the sensor and a METAL GRID crashes into place.  They hold their weapons behind it, ready. \n188-C   VARIOUS SHOTS - TERRORISTS - ON OTHER FLOORS          188-C \nAll now with earplugs in their CB's, taking up positions: \n189     AT THE LOBBY DOOR                                     189 \nThe SWAT team leader moves in SOP style to the door, scans it carefully. \n189-A   EXT. CENTURY CITY - ON MITCHELL AND ROBINSON -        189-A POLICE BARRICADES \nMitchell listens to CB radio. \nRIVERS (over radio) We're in position. \nMitchell looks at Robinson, who is visible tense.  Robinson hesitates, then gives his approval with a nod. \nMITCHELL (to CB) Go. \n190     QUICK SHOTS - INSIDE THE LOBBY                        190 \nThe SECURITY CAMERAS on the walls PAN and ZOOM: \n191     THE VAULT DOOR                                        191 \nKristoff DRILLS AWAY, is rewarded with the message FIFTH LOCK DEACTIVATED.  DO YOU WISH TO CONTINUE?  Nearby, Theo sits at a bank of monitors.  Screen after screen pinpoints all the police activity outside, down to the last detail.  Theo SMILES. Suddenly we RECOGNIZE that tune he's been whistling.  It's \"Singin' In The Rain.\" \nTHEO (into a throat mike) It was the night before Xmas, and all through the house, not a creature was stirring, expect for the four assholes coming in the rear in standard 2 X 2 cover formation. \n192     INT.

INTERIOR - BRIDGE - OUTER SPACE 
They are unstrapping. 
ROBY That's the part that always makes me feel like I'm gonna puke -- when we accelerate into light speed. 
STANDARD Quit complaining; we're in space. 
They rise and head out of the room. 
INTERIOR - CORRIDOR 
As they walk along. 
STANDARD I think the best thing to do with Broussard is to just freeze him as he is.  It'll arrest the progress of his disease, and he can get complete medical attention when we get back to the Colonies. 
ROBY We'll have to go into quarantine, maybe for quite a while. 
STANDARD That's okay, he can remain in hypersleep until they're ready to treat him. 
They enter the infirmary. 
INTERIOR - INFIRMARY 
As they enter the room, THEY ARE SHOCKED TO SEE BROUSSARD SITTING UP in BED -- AWAKE. 
BROUSSARD (hoarsely) ... Mouth's so dry... can I have some water... 
Instantly, Roby brings him a plastic cup of water.  Broussard gulps it down in a swallow. 
BROUSSARD (CONT'D) More. 
Roby quickly fills a much bigger container and hands it to Broussard, who greedily consumes the entire thing.  Then he sags, panting, on the bunk. 
STANDARD (softly) How do you feel, Dell? 
BROUSSARD (weakly) Wretched.  What happened to me? 
STANDARD Don't you remember? 
BROUSSARD Don't remember nothing.  Can't hardly remember my name. 
ROBY Are you in pain? 
BROUSSARD Not exactly, just feel like somebody's been beating me with rubber hoses for about six years. 
Melkonis laughs at this remark.  Broussard smiles faintly at him. 
STANDARD Hell, you're in great shape, you've got your sense of humor back! 
BROUSSARD God I'm hungry. 
ROBY Dell, what's the last thing you can remember? 
BROUSSARD ... I don't know... 
ROBY Do you remember the pyramid? 
BROUSSARD No.  Just some horrible dreams about smothering.  Where are we? 
STANDARD We're going home.  We're in hyperspace. 
MELKONIS We're going into the freezers now. 
BROUSSARD I'm really starving; can we get some food before we go into the freezers? 
STANDARD (laughs) I think that's a pretty reasonable request. 
INTERIOR - MULTI-PURPOSE ROOM 
The entire crew is seated around the table, eating huge portions greedily.  The cat eats from a dish on the table. 
HUNTER Boy do I feel a lot better.  It's a straight shot back to the Colonies, and then we can start taking bids on the paydirt.  Any bets on the top bid? 
FAUST (chewing) Well, we should at least be able to each buy our own planet. 
They all CHUCKLE. 
MELKONIS I'm going to write a book about this expedition.  I'm going to call it "The Snark Log." 
STANDARD (stiffly) The commander normally has first publication rights. 
MELKONIS Maybe we could write it together. 
ROBY First thing I'm going to do when we get back is eat some biological food. 
MELKONIS What's the matter, you don't like this stuff?

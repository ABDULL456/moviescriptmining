You both concur? 
EXPERTS 
(ad-lib) 
Oh, positively. 
The Judge emerges from his consultation with his experts and addresses Longfellow. 
JUDGE 
Mr. Deeds, in view of the extensive testimony and your continued silence and upon recommendation of the doctors, the Court considers it advisable for your own safety that you be committed to an institution as prescribed by law. You need medical attention, Mr. Deeds. 
(shrugs) 
Perhaps in a little while혰 
Suddenly the air is rent with the shrill voice of Babe. 
BABE 
No! No! No! Wait a minute! 
All are startled and look up. Babe runs right to the Judge. 
BABE 
You can't do it! You've got to make him talk. 
CEDAR'S VOICE 
Your Honor, I object! 
She turns directly to Longfellow - leaning over close to him. 
315. CLOSE SHOT - BABE AND LONGFELLOW 
BABE 
(pleading softly) 
Oh, darling, please. I know everything I've done. I know how horrible I've been. No matter what happens, if you never see me again, do this for me. 
JUDGE'S VOICE 
Miss Bennett, please! 
BABE 
(frantically) 
You said I could speak! You said I could have my say if I were rational. I'm rational. Please, let me take the witness chair. 
316. WIDER ANGLE 
BABE 
He must be made to defend himself before you arrive at a decision. 
JUDGE 
Very well. Take the stand. 
Babe goes up to the witness stand and sits down. 
BABE 
Oh, thank you! 
CEDAR 
(shouting) 
Your Honor, what she is saying has no bearing on the case. I object. 
JUDGE 
Let her speak. 
BABE 
I know why he won't defend himself! That has a bearing on the case, hasn't it? He's been hurt! He's been hurt by everybody's he met since he came here, principally by me. He's been the victim of every conniving crook in town. The newspapers pounced on him - made him a target for their feeble humor. 
317. CLOSE SHOT - BABE 
BABE 
I was smarter than the rest of them! I got closer to him so I could laugh louder. Why shouldn't he keep quiet? Every time he said anything it was twisted around to sound imbecilic. 
318. CLOSEUP - BABE 
As she continues. 
BABE 
He can thank me for it! I handed the gang a grand laugh. This is a fitting climax to my sense of humor. 
319. WIDER ANGLE 
As Cedar protests. 
CEDAR 
But Your Honor - this is preposterous! 
The Judge waves him down with a dismissing gesture of his hand. 
BABE 
Certainly I wrote those articles. I was going to get a raise - and a month's vacation! But I stopped writing them when I found out what he was all about! When I realized how real he was. 
320. CLOSE SHOT - LONGFELLOW 
As Babe's voice continues: 
BABE'S VOICE 
He could never fit in with our distorted viewpoint because he's honest and sincere - and good. If that man is crazy, Your Honor, the rest of us belong in straight-jackets. 
321. MED. SHOT 
Cedar jumps up. 
CEDAR 
Your Honor, this is absurd. The woman's obviously in love with him. 
BABE 
What's that got to do with it? 
CEDAR 
(shouting) 
Well, you are in love with him, aren't you? 
BABE 
(shouting back) 
What's that got to do with it? 
CEDAR 
(louder) 
You are , aren't you? 
BABE 
(just as loud) 
Yes!!! 
322. CLOSEUP - LONGFELLOW 
To be intercut during her speech. At first he merely glances up at her speculatively. Finally, he begins to show some interest. 
323. MED. SHOT FRONT OF COURTROOM 
Cedar turns to the Judge. 
CEDAR 
Your Honor, her testimony is of no value. Why shouldn't she defend him? It's a tribute to American womanhood - the instinct to protect the weak. I'm not saying that nobody likes the boy. I cherish a fond affection for him myself. But that doesn't mean to say혰 
In the middle of his speech, Mac - the editor - appears at his elbow. 
MAC 
When the windbag here gets through, Your Honor, I'd like to verify what Miss Bennett said. I'm her editor. When she quit her job, she told me what a swell fellow this man was. And anything Babe Bennett says is okay with me. 
JUDGE 
If you have anything to say, you will take the stand. 
MAC 
I've already said it, Your Honor. I just thought I'd like to get my two cents in. 
As he starts to go, CAMERA PANNING WITH HIM, he passes Longfellow. He nudges him. 
MAC 
Don't be a sucker, pal. Stand up and speak your piece. 
He disappears to his seat. 
COBB 
Your Honor, I've got a couple of cents I'd like to put in혰 
JUDGE 
Sit down! 
COBB 
I've been with this man ever since he came to New York혰 
324. MED. SHOT 
Shooting toward the Judge. He pounds his gavel, interrupting Cobb. 
JUDGE 
Sit down! There will be no further interruptions. 
Almost simultaneously with the Judge's speech, the farmer, somewhere in the audience, rises to his feet. 
FARMER 
How about us, Mr. Deeds! 
325. MED. SHOT 
Shooting toward audience. As the farmer finishes, a dozen others are on their feet. 
CROWD 
(ad-lib) 
Yes! What about us, Mr. Deeds! 
You're not going to leave us out in the cold!

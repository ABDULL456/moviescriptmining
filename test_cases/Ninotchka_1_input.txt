NINOTCHKA Where are they? 
SWANA You were very careless with our precious jewels, my dear. They're too expensive a toy for two children to play with. 
NINOTCHKA Where are they? 
SWANA Don't worry. Fortunately last night a very trustworthy friend kept his eyes open. Perhaps he overstepped his function as a waiter but he fulfilled his duty as a Russian. (she draws back the fur scarf she is wearing, revealing a diamond star, one of the jewels we have seen) I just put this on for sentiment. The rest are absolutely safe. I assure you. But if you feel like notifying the police... 
NINOTCHKA You leave me no choice. 
SWANA Won't it be rather embarrassing for a Soviet Envoy to disclose the circumstances under which she lost them? 
NINOTCHKA I will have to face the consequences, but so will you. Don't forget they will ask how you got them. 
SWANA That's very simple to answer. They were given to me by my mother. They were given to her by her mother, in fact they're mine, you cannot steal what belongs to you! 
She proceeds into the living room, followed by Ninotchka. 
NINOTCHKA They always belonged to the Russian people. They were paid for with their sweat, their blood, their lives and you will give them back! 
SWANA (triumphantly) I told you we had plenty to talk about. Shall we sit down? 
They both sit. 
SWANA (very matter-of-fact) Now, let's free ourselves from emotionalism and try to solve the problem in a practical way. Our situation has changed considerably. Before I had only a claim to the jewels. Now I have the jewels. 
NINOTCHKA In other words moral ideas have no weight with you... all right, then let's deal with legal facts. You know that France has recognized the Soviet. 
SWANA Unfortunately. 
NINOTCHKA Under Soviet law the jewels belong to the State. France is going to uphold that ownership. 
SWANA My lawyer agrees with you. He says France will uphold it in every court, but I will drag you through every court, don't forget that. And when I say it will take two years I am, as always, conservative. 
NINOTCHKA Won't those two years in court be expensive for you? I know that money was no object as long as you could squeeze it from the pockets of the people, but now... 
SWANA I may run out of money, but you have already run out of bread. Two years is a long time for your comrades to wait. 
NINOTCHKA I see. You have calculated in terms of hunger. 
SWANA No, I just wanted to be absolutely impartial. Both of us are faced with two rather uncomfortable years. We can condense these two years to two minutes if you want to accept my proposition. Ninotchka now realizes what she is after. 
NINOTCHKA Go on. 
SWANA I am willing to hand over the jewels and sign the necessary papers if you take that five-forty plane to Moscow. 
NINOTCHKA (quietly) That's not the way to win him back... not Leon. 
SWANA I think I know Leon quite as well as you... possibly a little better. Leave that worry to me. Five-forty leaves you time enough to close the deal with Monsieur Mercier, but naturally you'll be too busy for any farewells. I'll see to it that everything is done in the most expeditious manner and I will also see you to the airport. That's my proposition, Comrade Yakushova. 
Ninotchka knows herself to be faced with an inevitable decision. For a moment she cannot answer. The telephone rings. Ninotchka takes the receiver. 
NINOTCHKA (into telephone) Yes... (it is Leon) Oh hello... 
Much as she wants to talk to him she hesitates in the presence of Swana. Swana realizes the situation, gets up, and walks over to the window, where she stands looking out. 
CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA AT TELEPHONE 
NINOTCHKA Good morning, Leon... (forcing herself to be gay so that he will not suspect anything) ... no, you didn't waken me... I am fine, thank you.... Yes, it was... marvelous.... What?... for luncheon? I'm afraid I can't. I am going to be very busy... (looking for excuses) well, I have a lot of things to attend to today.... What?... Well to tell you the truth I am a little tired and I would like to rest... (she forces herself to laugh) you may be right... perhaps it is the champagne.... For dinner?... Of course... seven o'clock here?... (realizing that she will be gone by then) seven o'clock is all right.... Where?... That will be lovely.... Yes... (there is a knock on the door) Come in. (into the telephone) Yes?... (looking toward the door she sees something which makes her stop the conversation) Just a moment... (she puts the receiver on the table and walks toward the door) 
ANTEROOM BETWEEN LIVING ROOM AND CORRIDOR, shooting toward the living room. In the background we see Swana standing at the window. Ninotchka comes into the anteroom, closes the door in order to shut off Swana's view. Camera pans with Ninotchka as she walks toward the hall door where the bellboy is putting down a big flower basket. 
NINOTCHKA (to bellboy) You can leave it here. 
The bellboy exits. Ninotchka looks at the basket of flowers for a moment, then takes the envelope which is attached to the handle. She opens it and reads the enclosed letter. It must be a love note, for her eyes grow wet. She turns to the last page. 
INSERT 
"...and sweetheart, I have kept my first promise. I sent poor old Gaston to the market this morning and if you will look deep into the flowers you will see what I got for him...." 
CLOSE SHOT -- NINOTCHKA 
She puts her hand in the basket and takes out a bottle of milk. 
INSERT OF THE BOTTLE 
On the label we see a picture of a goat. 
NINOTCHKA 
She smiles sadly and goes to the telephone, which is on the console in the anteroom. 
NINOTCHKA (into telephone) Operator, will you switch the call please?... Hello?... Darling, your present just arrived.... It's very silly and very wonderful... thank you... No, I won't forget... seven o'clock.... (with great tenderness) Good-by, my darling.... What?... Oh... (softly) salute! 
She puts down the receiver. Camera pans with her as she goes to the door of the living room. She opens the door and goes in. Swana turns from the window. 
NINOTCHKA I am sorry to have kept you waiting, madame. 
SWANA -- AT THE AIRPORT 
DISSOLVE TO:

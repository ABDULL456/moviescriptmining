BOBBY Milo, don't fuck around with this. If there are dirty cops in the house, we all have a problem. So do me a favor: get off the strip, find somewhere to lie low and wait for my call. 
EXT BACK OF TRUMP CASINO- EVENING 
The scene has calmed down a little. A DARK SEDAN appears and RAY AND DWIGHT exit the car, looking like a an ugly, dangerous Odd Couple. 
An employee slips out the back door and hands Ray a PHOTO FROM SECURITY OF MILO AND CASS IN THE CASINO PARKING LOT. Dwight snatches the photo from Ray. 
DWIGHT Yeah, that's him. 
RAY Who's the chick? 
DWIGHT Who gives a fuck? Anyway, they can't be far. 
It's true. They aren't too far. They are: 
EXT OFF ROUTE 9- EVENING 
A LUXURIOUS, ROMANTIC B&B. Xmas lights winking on the trees, "Come All Ye Faithful" gently wafting out the oak front door. 
CHIRON: "9:00 PM. ROUTE 9 SOUTH. 36 HOURS TO GO." 
The whole scene looks beautiful, peaceful, romantic... 
CASS (O.S.) Ok. Kill me now. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL MILO AND CASS, parked in front. REVEAL THE SIGN NEXT TO THEM: "WELCOME TO CUPID'S CABIN". Yup. The place Milo and Cass ran off to and got married 3 years ago. 
MILO I'm sorry, it's the only place I know off the strip. 
CASS I'm not going in. What if they remember us? 
MILO They won't remember us. Why would they remember us? Just...try to act normal. 
INT LUXURY B&B- EVENING 
A small, family-run, luxury bed and breakfast. The kind of place that prides itself on its service. DAWN (long, graying hair, glasses, moccasins) greets them with a smile: 
DAWN Can I help you? (realizing) Wait, it can't be... 
She looks behind her at a bulletin board. At photos of all the happy couples who have passed through her. And finds: A PHOTO OF MILO AND CASS, ARMS AROUND EACH OTHER, DRINKING CHAMPAGNE, CASS SHOWING OFF AN ENGAGEMENT RING. 
DAWN (to the back room) Edmund, come quick! 
A balding man in flannel comes out, takes one look, and clasps both hands to his chest. 
EDMUND Be still my beating heart. 
MILO (LOW) Looks like they remember us. 
CASS (SAME) Ya think? 
EDMUND What a lovely surprise. It's been, what, 3 years? 
Milo and Cass both try to downplay: 
MILO Has it? 
CASS I don't really remember... 
DAWN (REALIZING) And you came back! To celebrate your anniversary! 
CASS Oh, no. No, no... 
EDMUND What an honor for us! 
CASS Actually, we're not... 
DAWN You know what? In light of this special special occasion: it's on the house! 
Before Cass can protest more, MILO GRABS HER ARM. 
MILO Honey? Can I talk to you? 
He pulls her slightly aside. 
MILO (LOW) You have any money? 
CASS (SAME) No, as you recall, I gave you all my money at the blackjack table... (realizing) You blew all the money! 
MILO Hey! I would have won it back if someone hadn't tasered me in the bathroom! 
CASS So. Use a credit card. 
MILO Mine's max'd. Lemme have yours. 
CASS Mine's max'd too. (off his look) What, I like to shop.

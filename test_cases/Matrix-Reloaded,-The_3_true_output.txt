"For decades, we have fought force-on-force, in the real world, without a conclusion. Now, after nearly a century of war, were at a standstill. The only way that we can see to win is by destroying their source of energy. We have to pull the plug on them. We must crash the Matrix." 
MORPHEUS grins slyly. 
MORPHEUS 
"Remember, when I told you, that Ill show you how deep the rabbit hole goes?" 
NEO 
"Yes." 
MORPHEUS 
"I brought you deep, yet I no longer know the way. No one does. With every second we sink deeper than before. You are our guiding light, now. Your powers exceed mine a millionfold. I have shown you the path to victory, Neo. Lead us down it." 
INT. MAIN DECK 
MORPHEUS, NEO, TRINITY, CHOI, and  NIOBE are on the chairs  as theyre being JACKED IN by CIRCA and RAZOR. 
CUT TO: RAZOR jumps in the  operators chair, his hands blur over  the touchscreens and keyboard as he drops his crewmates into the Matrix. 
MORPHEUS (O.S.) 
"Were going straight for the throat, people." 
ANGLE ON: RAZOR and CIRCA  typing like made at their  keyboards. RAZOR hits the ENTER  key. They look  on, transfixed with  anticipation. The screaming Matrix code grinds to a readable halt. The slap each others hands and continue hacking. 
MORPHEUS (O.S.) 
"We have the advantage of surprise. They wont expect us to return so soon." 
INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE 
THE FIVE  of them  stand, immobile,  around a  ringing phone  as their minds filter in to their body images. They are dressed practically  in denim  and leather,  like blue  collar workers.  Their dress  wouldnt attract the slightest  bit of attention,  except for the  padded coats and tote bags filled with firepower. 
INT. MAIN BRIDGE 
CIRCA 
"Keep your eyes out for changes, theyre modifying things. Dial 0 for operator." 
INT. ABANDONED WAREHOUSE 
MORPHEUS holds his celly to his ear. 
CIRCA (O.S.) 
"And have a nice day." 
HE drops the phone into his pocket. They turn to him. 
MORPHEUS 
"Niobe, youre the liasion to our operators. Neo, what do you have for a game plan?" 
NEO 
"Where is the mainframe?" 
MORPHEUS 
"The Metacortex building." 
NEOs jaw drops. 
NEO 
"What the fuck? Thats where I worked." 
CHOI 
"And what do you think you were doing there, writing code for video games? You were working for The Man." 
TRINITY 
"Its true, Neo. Metacortex employs humans to write code for the Matrix." 
NEO 
"I thought I was working on a fucking database." 
MORPHEUS 
"They keep the left hand from seeing what the right hand is doing. Thats how an evil system can be made by innocent people. But, that doesnt matter." 
NEO recovers. 
NEO 
"How bout this? I just walk up to the Metacortex building and blow it up?" 
CHOI laughs. 
CHOI 
"What, by power of will?"

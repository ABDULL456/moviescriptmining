CHANCE Certainly, Ben. 
RAND Senator Rowley's widow, Sophie, is hosting an evening reception tomorrow evening honoring Ambassador Skrapinov of the Soviet Union... I think it's rather obvious that Robert won't allow me to attend, so - would you go in my place, and escort Eve? 
CHANCE Yes. I would like to escort Eve. 
RAND Good. Together, the two of you should create quite a stir - I can already hear the gossip. 
EVE (with a blush) ... Ben, really... 
RAND (reaches out a tired hand to Chance - Chance holds it) ... Thank you, Chauncey... Thank you very much. (takes back hand) ... All right, Robert, I'm all yours. 
Eve and Chance quietly leave the room. Allenby watches Chance go, then readies Rand for the injection. 
INT. RAND MANSION - THIRD FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT 
The elevator door opens, Eve and Chance come into the hallway. Chance looks back at the elevator for a beat, then the two walk quietly down the hall. 
EVE (stopping by bedroom door) ... You don't happen to have a tuxedo in your suitcase, do you? 
CHANCE No, thank you. 
EVE Oh. Well, we can fix up one of Ben's for you tomorrow night. Sophie insists an Black Tie. 
CHANCE I see. 
EVE (a pause, softly) ... I have very few friends, Chauncey... And Benjamin's friends are all quite a bit older... 
Eve gives Chance a long look, then kisses him on the lips. She steps back, smiles. 
EVE (CONT'D) ... Good night, Chauncey. 
CHANCE Good night, Eve. 
Eve goes into her bedroom, closes the door. Chance heads for his room as though nothing had happened. 
INT. WHITE HOUSE - OVAL OFFICE ANTE ROOM - MORNING 
Kaufman and the five other Aides nervously await the President's arrival. The door opens, the President briskly enters the room. 
PRESIDENT Good morning, gentlemen. 
AIDES (as one) Good morning, sir. 
The President leads the way into the Oval Office. 
INT. OVAL OFFICE - MORNING 
As the President goes to his desk, Kaufman hands him a folder. The President sits, reads it quickly, it is very brief. 
PRESIDENT (to Kaufman) This is not what I requested. 
KAUFMAN No, sir. 
PRESIDENT This information goes back three days. I want the standard file, you know that. 
KAUFMAN Right, Chief. 
PRESIDENT So...? Where the hell is it? 
KAUFMAN We... uh, have been unable to come up with any information before the man appeared at Mr. Rand's home ... and, uh... 
PRESIDENT What the hell are you talking about, Kaufman? 
KAUFMAN Well, we do have data from Honeycutt's sources, Chief - but it isn't pertinent. 
PRESIDENT I'd like to hear that data, Kaufman. 
KAUFMAN Yes, sir. 
Kaufman takes a clipboard from the man at his right. 
KAUFMAN (CONT'D) (reading) Suits hand-made by a tailor in Chicago in 1918. The tailor went out of business in 1929, then took his own life. ... His shoes were hand-made in 1928. The cobbler has long since been dead. Underwear, all of the finest cloth, factory destroyed by fire in 1938. The man carries no identification; no wallet, no driver's license, no credit cards. ... He carries one item along with him, a fine Swiss pocket-watch crafted at the turn of the century; so far they have been unable to ascertain where or when purchase was made. ... He has never dyed his hair. ... Computers have analyzed Gardiner's vocal characteristics; it is impossible to determine his ethnic background, they feel his accent may be northeastern, but they will not commit to that. ... Fingerprint check proved negative, no identification possible. (a pause) ... That's it, Mr. President. 
The President stares at Kaufman for a beat, then speaks into his intercom. 
PRESIDENT (into intercom) Miss Davis - I'd like my eggs poached this morning, please.

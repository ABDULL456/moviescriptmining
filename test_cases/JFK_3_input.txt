Julia Ann Mercer, 28, looks at Jim with sincere eyes.  Her husband, a prosperous Republican businessman, watches from the corner.  Jim - along with Al - has her testimony in front of him. 
JIM In the sheriff's report, Mrs. Mercer, it says you were at Dealey Plaza two hours before the assassination but that... 
MERCER Yes, it was about 11 in the morning. I was driving west on Elm Street toward the Triple Underpass, in a rented car - a blue Valiant.  I'll never forget that day. 
FLASHBACK TO Dealey Plaza in 1963.  It's a normal scene - cars, traffic, people starting to arrive for Kennedy's appearance.  We catch a glimpse of Julia Ann Mercer, 23, driving, then stopping traffic. 
MERCER ...there was quite a bit of traffic and I was stopped alongside a green pickup truck.  It was very noticeable because it was blocking traffic and it was parked with two wheels on the curb.  When I saw the gun, I thought - the Secret Service is not very secret. 
She glances over at the man in the driver's seat.  It's Jack Ruby, wearing a green jacket.  Then she sees a young white man in his mid - 20's, in a gray jacket, brown pants, plaid shirt and wool stocking hat, getting out of the passenger side, going to the rear of the van, opening a tool compartment and removing a package that looks like a rifle wrapped in paper.  He walks up the embankment in the direction of the picket fence.  Ruby looks over and stares at Julia Ann, who turns away and notices three police officers standing near a motorcycle on the overpass bridge.  Her eyes lock with Ruby's a second time and as the traffic moves, she drives on. 
MERCER The next morning, Saturday, I went to the FBI office and the agents showed me photographs... 
In the Dallas FBI office, Mercer sits at a table looking at photos.  Two FBI agents stand near her showing her photos. She shakes her head "no" several times, until they put a shot of Jack Ruby in front of her.  She holds it up. 
MERCER I picked out three pictures that looked generally like the driver of the truck and then... 
MERCER That's the man. 
FBI AGENT (to Second Agent) Jack Ruby. 
SECOND AGENT What about these others?  You said they might be him. 
MERCER They look a little like him.  But no, (holding up the Ruby photo) I'm sure this is the man. 
Back in the present, Jim continues to question Mercer. 
JIM You mean you identified him on Saturday, the day before Ruby shot Oswald? 
MERCER That's right.  When I saw him on TV, I was shocked.  I said to my family, "that was the man I saw in the truck." 
JIM (skeptical) But you didn't seem nearly so sure in your statement to the Warren Commission. 
MERCER That's what bothers me, Mr. Garrison. You see, they've been altered.  My statements... 
Jim is silent.  Mercer picks up the report and finds the pertinent paragraphs: 
MERCER This says "Mercer could not identify any of the photographs as being identical with the person she had observed slouched over the wheel of a green Ford pickup truck."  That's not true.  I recognized him and I told them so... They also said it was a dark green air conditioning truck, which it was not.  And here... (she goes to another report) ...on the Dallas Sheriff's report. This is really strange.  See that notarized signature on the bottom of each page?  That's not my signature. And there never was any notary present during any of my questioning. (she hands the papers back to Jim) I guess that's all... 
JIM Mrs. Mercer, as a former FBI man, it's difficult to accept this. 
MERCER I know, but Mr. Garrison, the FBI is just not doing their job. 
HUSBAND I'm a Republican, Mr. Garrison, and I don't go in for this kind of government bashing, but I must tell you something's not right when they don't even bother to call Julia in front of the Warren Commission. 
JIM They didn't call a lot of people, Mr. Mercer.  I think it's safe to say the Warren Report is a work of fiction. 
DALLAS CLUB - NIGHT(1967) 
BEVERLY, a woman of ample proportions and a big, cute Texas face, ex-club singer, meets with Jim and Lou Ivon in a nightclub not unlike Ruby's Carousel. 
LOU Beverly, tell Mr. Garrison about the Carousel club. 
BEVERLY (V.O.) Oh yes, I used to go over there a lot to see Jack and especially my friend Jada who danced there.  It was the real swinging spot in town. Everybody came.  Businessmen, politicians from Austin, Lyndon Johnson's friends... Dallas was a slow town back then.  You chewed toothpicks, played dominos, spit and dated policemen.  But Jack's was exciting.  There were always cops there.  Jack liked 'em around, but he used to throw the drunks out himself, 'cause he was kinda a violent- tempered man... it seemed everybody in those days knew Jack was with the Mob.  The cops were "bad" back then - they'd shake you down for the money in your pocket.  They put a lotta people in the cemetery, especially colored people. 
LOU Beverly, what about Lee? 
Jada and Beverly sit down at the table with Ferrie, Oswald, and Jack, with Jack doing the buying.  It's too loud to hear anything. 
BEVERLY (V.O.) Oh, yeah.  One time I came in, Jack introduces me to these two guys.  He said, "Beverly, this is my friend Lee..." and I didn't catch the other guy's name.  He was a weird-looking guy with those funny little eyebrows. The other guy, Lee, didn't make much of an impression either.  He wasn't good-looking or nuthin', he didn't look like he had any money, and he was in a bad mood, so I didn't pay him much mind.  Well, I might not remember a name, but I always remember a face.  When I saw him tow weeks later on the television, I screamed, "Oh, my God - that's him!  That's Jack's friend!"  I knew right then it had something to do with the Mafia... Well, about a week later, after she told the newspapers she'd met this guy Lee with Jack, Jada disappears off the face of the Earth... 
THE CAMERA MOVES IN ON JADA 
BEVERLY (V.O.) Never knew what happened to her till Herman offered to sell me her wardrobe.  I said, "but Jada's coming back," and I remember the way he smiled... and I knew she was never coming back. 
BACK TO the 1967 scene. 
JIM Will you testify,  Beverly? 
BEVERLY I don't think so, sir. 
LOU I thought when we came here, we had an agreement. 
BEVERLY I just don't want to become another statistic like her.  If they can kill the President, do you think they're gonna think twice about a two-bit showgirl like me? 
LOU We could call you in, Beverly. 
JIM I know the pressure you're under, Beverly.  Don't think I don't. (as he exits) I understand. 
DISSOLVE TO DEALEY PLAZA(1967) 
Our view is from the roof of the building on the extreme south side of the Plaza.  J.C. Price, the building engineer, in hat and overalls, points for Jim and Lou. 
PRICE (V.O.) ...yes, sir, right here on this spot. The shots came from near that wooden fence over there, near the overpass. 
The camera tightens on the picket fence. 
PRICE I saw a man run from this spot and go behind the Book Depository - 30 minutes later I gave this information to the Sheriff. 
On the overpass near Dealey Plaza, S.M. Holland, a tan, elderly, leather-faced signal supervisor, points to the picket fence for Jim and Lou.  His accent is thick and rural.  We saw him before, briefly, when Jim was reading the Warren Report. 
HOLLAND I made it very clear to the Warren people one of the shots came from behind that picket fence.  I heard the report and saw the smoke come out about 6 or 8 feet above the ground, right out from under those trees.  There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind... 
FLASHBACK TO the restaged shooting.  The smoke hangs under the trees. 
CUT TO Richard Dodd on the overpass.  He's a cowboy type with a hat and an even thicker accent than Holland.

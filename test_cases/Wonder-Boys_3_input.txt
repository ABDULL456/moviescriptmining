GRADY Carvel? Where's Carvel? 
JAMES LEER Outside Scranton. 
GRADY I never heard of it. 
JAMES LEER It's a hellhole. Three motels and a mannequin factory. My dad worked there for thirty-five years. 
GRADY Your father worked in a mannequin factory? 
JAMES LEER Seitz Plastics. That's where he met my morn. She was a fry cook in the cafeteria. Before that, she'd been a dancer. 
GRADY What kind of dancer? . 
JAMES LEER Whatever kind they wanted her to be. 
GRADY (in disbelief) James Leer, are you telling me your mother was a stripper? 
JAMES LEER I'm telling you what I was told by my uncle. And he should know. He ran half a dozen men's clubs in Baltimore before he skipped town on a bad debt. 
GRADY Didn't you say your Mom went to Catholic school? 
JAMES LEER When we fall, we fall hard. 
GRADY Amazing. 
GRADY takes the joint from the ashtray, lights it, then notices-with surprise--James has his hand out. 
GRADY (cont'd) I thought you were the guy who didn't like to lose control of his emotions. 
JAMES LEER Maybe I just needed the moment to present itself. 
55	EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD (KINSHIP) - DAY .(ONE HOUR LATER) 
GRADY glides down the graceful, tree-lined streets of a modest, but well-kept neighborhood. James still has the JOINT-now only a tiny nub-pinched between his fingers. 
JAMES LEER This is so nice. It's like where Andy Hardy would live. What's it called again? 
GRADY Kinship. 
JAMES LEER Kinship. And what's here? 
GRADY Unless I miss my bet...my wife. 
James' heavy eyelids flutter with surprise. 
JAMES LEER The one that left you? 
GRADY That's right. That one. 
56	EXT. FRONT PORCH - WINTERS FAMILY HOUSE 
GRADY RAPS on the front door, then cups his hands against the glass of the living room window, squints inside. Nothing. As he turns away, GRADY sees James sitting on the hood of the Galaxie with the box of powdered donuts. He's sitting in the indentation. 
JAMES LEER Someone jumped on your car with their butt ..- 
GRADY How can you tell? 
JAMES LEER You can see the outline of a butt. 
As GRADY nods, James holds out the donut box. 
JAMES LEER (cont'd) Want one. They're incredible. Incredible. 
GRADY Smoke the rest of that joint, James, and you can start on the box. 
58	EXT. BACK PORCH - BACK YARD (MOMENTS LATER) 
As GRADY steps onto the back porch, James follows. 
JAMES LEER Maybe she didn't come here. 
GRADY She came here. We'll just wait. In the meantime, I need you to shimmy through. 
James stares at the "Doggy Door" cut into the back porch door. 
GRADY Relax. Emily hasn't carried a house key since she was twelve years old. And your hips are as slim as hers. 
JAMES LEER It's not that. It just reminded me of-- you know-of what's in the car. In the trunk. 
GRADY (a pang of guilt himself) Oh. Right. Well, let's try not to think about that. 
James takes another sad glance at the little door, then drops onto ail fours. 
59	INT. LIVING ROOM - WINTERS HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
GRADY leads James through the house. Everything about it speaks of family. Even the furniture seems arranged so that people will gather together, light a fire, talk. 
JAMES LEER It feels really... good. ..here. 
GRADY I know. It's the house you want to wake up in on Christmas morning. (moving off) Make yourself at home. I'll be right back.

INT. TOLL BOOTH - DAWN 
A LONE TOLL BOOTH ATTENDANT sits inside his glass box on an empty stretch of interstate. This is HENRY. He looks out at the horizon. It's starting to get light out. There's snow on the ground. He's neither asleep nor awake. 
INT. TOLL BOOTH - MOMENTS LATER 
HENRY'S PLASTIC GLOVES unscrew a THERMOS, pour coffee into a Styrofoam cup. There are only a few drops left. 
A CAR Approaches. Henry straightens, slides open his window. But the CAR veers over to the automated EZ-PASS LANE... Henry closes the window, watches the car disappear. He downs the last of his coffee, looks back out at the horizon again. It's cloudy out there. 
A CLOCK flips to 6:00. 
INT. TOLL BOOTH - LATER 
Henry packs up his thermos, puts on his coat and steps out into the icy morning. He walks toward his truck. The traffic is beginning to build. 
EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING 
Henry's old FORD PICK-UP drives past the enormous, abandoned CENTRAL TRAIN TERMINAL. 
EXT. BUFFALO STREET - MORNING 
The pick-up turns down toward a neighborhood of modest salt-box houses. 
EXT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MORNING 
Henry's truck rolls into his driveway. 
INT. HENRY'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Henry enters. Hangs up his down jacket on a row of hooks. It's clean and ordinary in here. His wife, DEBBIE, is in the kitchen. She's wearing a NURSES uniform. Henry notices the dining room table set for one for breakfast. Eggs, bacon, sausage. He's a little surprised. Debbie appears. Lays down the toast. 
HENRY Smells good. 
DEBBIE Sit down. He sits. She smiles. Starts buttering the toast. 
HENRY Wow. Thanks. He digs in. 
DEBBIE How was your night? 
HENRY Good. How was yours? She's still buttering the toast. Carefully. 
DEBBIE Good. She sets it down. 
HENRY This is great. She sits down next to him. Watches him eat. 
HENRY (CONT'D) Your shift's at eight thirty? She nods. 
HENRY (CONT'D) You not eating? 
DEBBIE I already did. He takes another bite. 
HENRY You okay? 
Pause. 
DEBBIE Are you coming with me to Cindy and Bill's on Saturday? 
HENRY Sure. What time? Pause. 
DEBBIE For the baby shower. 
HENRY Right. She just stares at him... 
DEBBIE Well, I don't want to go to Cindy and Bill's. 
HENRY What? 
DEBBIE I mean I want Cindy and Bill to come here. 
HENRY Cindy and Bill are welcome here anytime. Pause. 
DEBBIE Henry. Isn't it time...isn't it time for us? Henry stops eating. 
HENRY You're talking about kids. 
DEBBIE Of course I am. 
HENRY Okay. 
DEBBIE 'Okay' you want kids? Pause.

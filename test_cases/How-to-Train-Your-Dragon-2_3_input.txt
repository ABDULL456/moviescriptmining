The warrior slowly removes the strange mask, revealing VALKA, 40, beneath. Her eyes meet his, equally wide-eyed and aghast. 
VALKA ... but a mother never forgets. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 38. 
Hiccup stammers, tongue-tied, aghast. 
VALKA (CONT'D) Come... 
EXT. ARCTIC SKY - NIGHT (MIDNIGHT SUN) 
(Sequence 1325 - Searching) 
Stoick and Gobber search over the frigid waves that lap against the pack ice. 
STOICK Boar-headed! Just like his mother! She could never stay put either. 
Gobber glances over at Stoick, who's hunched over, brow furrowed and solemn. 
GOBBER Ah, he's just twenty. And a Viking. I mean, could there be a worse combination? Ha! When I think of how stubborn and senseless YOU were back in the day... well, not much has changed, actually. 
STOICK You know what he's like. He won't give up, Gobber. And if Hiccup finds Drago, before we find him... 
GOBBER Bah! NOTHING can hurt Hiccup so long as that Night Fury's around. It's a Night Fury! Framed by a hole in the ice, a glistening object bobs on the surface below. Stoick squints and CIRCLES BACK, leading Skullcrusher in a DIVE toward it. Stoick SNAGS it out of the water. It's Hiccup's helmet. 
Gobber pulls alongside Stoick, seeing his look of dread. Stoick holds the helmet out for his dragon to SMELL. 
STOICK Find him, Skullcrusher. Find him. 
Skullcrusher SNIFFS the helmet like a bloodhound, ROARS, and suddenly CHANGES HEADING. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 39. 
INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - TUNNEL - DAWN 
(Scene 1400 - A New Family) 
CLOSE ON Hiccup, flustered, winded, chasing VALKA through tightly winding corridors. 
HICCUP Hold on! Wait just a minute! Come back here! 
VALKA This way. Come. 
HICCUP You can't just say something like that and run off! You're my mother?! I mean, what the -- do you grasp how INSANE it sounds?! 
(BEAT) I have questions! 
VALKA Come. Quickly! 
Hiccup follows her over the difficult terrain. He tries to clamber over a tall rock, unsuccessfully. 
HICCUP Where have you been all this time? 
Toothless boosts him over. Hiccup lands on the other side. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) What've you been doing?! They said you were dead! Everyone thinks you were eaten by... Hiccup trails off as he enters... 
INT. DRAGON MOUNTAIN - OASIS - CONTINUOUS 
... a stadium-sized chamber teeming with ferns, waterfalls, hot springs and THOUSANDS of new DRAGONS. 
Hiccup wanders in, basking in the in the amazing sight: a dome of sweating ice capping a geothermal micro climate, filled with dragons of every shape and kind. 
He spots Valka clinging to a basalt overhang, watching him. HTTYD 2 (D. DeBlois) - FINAL DRAFT - 05/05/14 40. 
HICCUP This is where you've been for twenty years? 
She nods from her perch. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) You've been rescuing them. 
She nods again, this time with a smile. 
HICCUP (CONT'D) Unbelievable. 
VALKA You're not upset? 
HICCUP What? No. I don't know. It's a bit much to get my head around, to be frank. It's not every day you find out your mother is some kind of crazy, feral, vigilante dragon lady. 
Valka chuckles, and using her dragon's wing, lowers herself to the ground like a skilled acrobat.

JERRY (cont'd) I've got the instincts of a panther! (joust) I've got Dorothy Boyd on my side! 
DOROTHY Don't worry about me.  I can get jobs -- 
JERRY We will be fine! 
DOROTHY -- especially one like this. 
JERRY And I am... 
He becomes very aware of himself. Acting out in a virtual stranger's small-but-comfortable living room. 
JERRY (continuing) I am drunk. 
He collapses onto the sofa, embarrassed.  Shaking his head. Dorothy scoots closer in an adjacent chair.  She breaks the personal barrier, carefully touching his wound with the wet tip of the aloe vera plant. 
DOROTHY Truth? 
JERRY Sure. 
Dorothy turns to see that Laurel's two shoes are still very visible at the kitchen door.  Decides to ignore them.  She gets closer. 
DOROTHY Sure, I care about the job.  Of course.  But mostly... (very honest) ...  I want to be inspired. 
There is something inspiring about the way she says the word "inspiring." 
JERRY Me too. 
DOROTHY What you wrote inspired me. 
He is catching a scent of that most ancient elixer.  A woman's affection.  Their heads inch closer together. 
DOROTHY (continuing) I'm working with you because of that memo... 
JERRY Mission... statement... 
They kiss.  It turns rather passionate.  She places a cool hand on his cheek.   He places a hand on her breast.  The taxi beeps outside.  She pulls away.  Both regard the hand on her breast. 
DOROTHY Well. 
JERRY Sorry about this hand. (he rises unsteadily) You know that feeling -- you're not completely embarrassed yet, but you glimpe tomorrow's embarrassment? 
DOROTHY Don't worry about it, boss. 
JERRY Oh shit.  You said "boss." 
DOROTHY Yeah, I did. 
JERRY Now I feel like Clarence Thomas. 
DOROTHY No.  No don't feel like Clarence Thomas. 
JERRY No, I do.  I feel like Clarence Thomas. (the worst day ever) I'm like... harrassing you... right now. 
DOROTHY I may not sue. 
He laughs a little.  Music.  Unsure what more to say, Jerry rubs his face.  And then: 
JERRY Well, good evening. 
DOROTHY Good evening. 
He stands, returns the fireplace poker to her, and exits. Stumbling slightly on the first step leading down from the front porch, he recovers with style. 
JERRY We'll be okay.  And I'm going to take my... one client and we're gonna go all the way. 
He takes a few more steps, re-balancing bags, coughs a little.  He is a mess, and he knows it. 
JERRY (continuing; loving the dark humor) Hey. I'm back. 
She laughs, waves, and exits back into the kitchen.  She regards the poker still in her hand. Laurel watches her conflicted, slightly lovesick sister. 
INT. CAB -- NIGHT 
Jerry in the back of the cab.  He turns for a moment, looking back at the warm house he's just left. Something is scratching at his soul, trying to get in. Music continues. He was strangely comfortable there, as the house disappears from his view. 
FADE TO 
EXT. TEMPE PRACTICE AREA -- DAY 
Rod Tidwell races to catch up to a wobbly, overthrown pass. He snags it out of the air, and moves gracefully downfield. He turns back to shout at the quarterback for the wobbly pass, and slams into a padding post.  Dennis Wilburn, the GM we met earlier, crosses in front of Maguire, giving him a look.  Maguire forges ahead anyway. 
JERRY We gotta talk about his contract, Dennis. 
WILBURN Your timing is impeccable, Maguire. Gee, I can't imagine how you ever lost Cush... 
Wilburn moves on, scoffing loudly. 
INT. LOCKER ROOM SHOWER AREA -- DAY

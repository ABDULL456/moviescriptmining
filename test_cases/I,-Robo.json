{"train": "I, ROBOT \nby \nHillary Seitz \nFADE IN: \n1   On a DEEP...DEEP...DARKNESS.                                       1 \nA FLICKER. Of LIGHT. Off to the side. Just barely. Noticeable. ORANGE...YELLOW...as we realise...It's FIRE... \nA SOUND.   Something SHATTERING... \nThen. A DISEMBODIED VOICE. Muted. We can't quite make out What it's saying. As it gets LOUDER. And LOUDER. When we finally. Understand... \nDISEMBODIED VOICE You are in danger... \nCUT TO: \n2   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CLOSE ON                                2 \nDEL SPOONER'S FACE.    His eyes, snapping open.   His face, covered in sweat. \nPULL BACK to REVEAL him lying in bed. Sheets, tangled around his legs. Alarm clock, playing something relentlessly cheerful. \nSpooner slaps it off. Sits up. Wincing. Bends his RIGHT ARM. Stiff. He reaches for a BOTTLE OF PILLS. Shakes out a couple and swallows them. Trying to forget. That dream. \nYou are in danger... \nHe rubs his hands over his face. Gets out of bed. His apartment, basic. Unremarkable. Bearing the signs of someone who lives alone. Shades drawn. A little messy. \n3   INT. SHOWER - MORNING                                              3 \nSpooner turns his face into the jet of water. \n4   INT. BATHROOM - MORNING                                            4 \nShaves with a razor.    Using his left hand.   Knicks the cleft of his chin. Shit. \n5   INT. KITCHEN - MORNING                                             5 \nStares down at the single egg in a saucepan.      Waiting for it to boil. \n6   INT. HALLWAY - MORNING                                          6 \nHeads down the hallway. Looping a knotted tie around his neck. Kicks some neglected mail from the door and reaches for the handle. Takes a deep breath and... \n7   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING                                  7 \n...steps outside. Into the flow of COMMUTERS heading for the elevated trains. Elbow to elbow. A river of humanity. \nSpooner moves along, like everyone else. Suddenly. His shoulders tense. That feeling at the back of his neck. He turns and sees... \nA ROBOT. Just behind him. Humanoid in design, but still obviously a machine. Metal and synthetic casings covering hydraulic muscles. The thing senses his stare. Looks up with a muted WHIR... \nROBOT (metallic voice) Good day, sir... \nSpooner. Speeds up his pace.     Weaving through the crowd to lose the robot. \nWe now realise this is THE FUTURE. Towering apartment buildings block the sun. The street packed with traffic. PEDESTRIANS wearing their computers like form-fitting portable offices. Spooner throws a look at his surroundings: \nUp high an INDUSTRIAL ROBOT rolls down the side of a building cleaning windows. \nA WORK CREW of oddly-shaped RUBE GOLDBERG ROBOTS efficiently repairs the street. No human supervision. \nA ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW. Lumbering along the sidewalk. Scrubbing, sweeping. Emptying trash... \nHumanoid ROBOTS dotting the crowd. Following their owners. Walking slowly, deliberately. Carrying boxes. Groceries. Briefcases. \nStamped on all the ROBOTS' SIDES, a LOGO:   III LAWS SAFE. \nSpooner stops to wait at a light with other PEDESTRIANS. Directly in front of him, a LITTLE GIRL clutches her father's neck. She smiles big at Spooner. Front teeth missing. \nLITTLE GIRL Hi. \nSPOONER Hi. \nBut it's not her father. It's her ROBOT CARETAKER.    The robot turns. Looks at the girl. \nROBOT You are not allowed to talk to strangers. \nSpooner, disgusted.   Has had enough.   He steps off the curb Just as... \nOLD MAN Yes. But you are to say, \"No, thank you.\" \nSpooner nods a little. The Old Man raises the coffee to his lips, but doesn't take a sip. \nOLD MAN Coffee? \nSPOONER No.    Thank you. \nOLD MAN As you wish. \nThe Old Man takes a sip. He doesn't move. There is no movement except for a whisper of steam rising from the coffee pot. \nSPOONER You want to tell me something about Dr. Hogenmiller? About his death? \nThe Old Man smiles. \nOLD MAN I want to tell you that his death was not a suicide. \nSPOONER And why do you say that? \nOLD MAN Why?   Because I want you to know it. \nSPOONER I understand that. But what specifically leads you to believe that he didn't commit suicide? \nOLD MAN (considers) Nothing specifically. \nSpooner shifts his weight.   Agitated. \nSPOONER Under normal circumstances that wouldn't be enough to get you a homicide investigation. \nOLD MAN But this is not \"normal circumstances,\" is it, Detective Spooner? \nSPOONER No.    It isn't. \nOLD MAN Then you will find out who killed Dr. Hogenmiller, yes? And then you will tell me. \nSpooner's losing his patience. \nSPOONER If you were murdered, Doctor, I'll find out. And you'll be the first to know..... \nJUST THEN the HOLOGRAM of DR. HOGENMILLER vanishes in a burst of LIGHT, as does the table, the coffee pot, and the conference room. Spooner, suddenly finds himself standing in front of a LARGE VIEW SCREEN inside a SMALL METAL CHAMBER. \n15   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                              15 \nSpooner steps out into the hallway and into...AN ESCORT ROBOT. \nESCORT ROBOT Please follow me. \nSpooner. Reluctantly starts to follow it.     Passes another doorway. POLICE TAPE stretched across it.     Catches a brief glimpse of... \nDR. HEINRICH HOGENMILLER'S BODY. \nSplayed out across the floor. Surrounded by CRIME SCENE TECHNICIANS. He pauses. Taking in the scene. Then continues on. \n16   INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - CORPORATE BOARDROOM - DAY                  16 \nTwo large doors emblazoned with the U.S. ROBOTICS LOGO open automatically. Inside, an enormous glass-enclosed boardroom looking out over the entire complex. \nSpooner walks through the doorway. His escort robot trailing behind him. An army of corporate types sit around a conference table. Young. Energetic. You can practically feel the brains and ambition. \nSPOONER Usually I ask who's in charge... \nSpooner's eyes lock with a MAN sitting at the head of the table. 60s, handsome, charismatic. Dr. LANCE ROBERTSON, founder and CEO of U.S. Robotics. \nSPOONER But everyone knows you, Dr. Robertson. \nRobertson smiles.   Pretends to instruct his people. \nROBERTSON Remind me to cut back on my talk show appearances. \nLAUGHTER. \nROBERTSON Welcome to U.S. Robotics, Detective. I regret you're not visiting us under more pleasant circumstances. Allow me to introduce Mr. Aronson, our head of Legal Affairs. \nA prematurely graying MAN leaning against the wall.    Nods hello. \nROBERTSON And the gentleman to my right is Dr. Alfred Lanning, Director of Research. \nAlfred Lanning, only one there in a tie.   Nods. \nROBERTSON They'll be available to answer any questions you might have during your investigation. You'll understand how anxious we are to resolve this matter -- especially before the press gets wind of it. There are some anti-robot sentiments out there as you know, Detective, and we're not eager to stir them up. So. Where would you like to begin? \nSPOONER We can begin with whether or not the old man put a gun to his head and pulled the trigger. \nBALDEZ Who? \nSpooner.   Stands.   Pointing down at Hogenmiller. \nSPOONER Him. \nAnd steps over the body, leaving a confused Baldez. Stepping deeper, into the lab. Calvin. Following. \nSPOONER I spoke to a dead man today.   Want to tell me about that? \nCALVIN Dr. Hogenmiller's hologram took his appointments. Attended staff meetings. He hated corporate life. The hologram enabled him to focus on his work. It's just a device, Detective. \nSPOONER A device that called the police. \nCALVIN The sound of the gunshot would've triggered a 911. \nSPOONER But the call came directly to me. \nCALVIN We're talking about a mechanism designed by Hogenmiller to say provocative things. To irritate and confound his colleagues. \nSPOONER And that's what you think it is? \nCALVIN I'm sorry, but this whole investigation is the result of a dead man's toy messing with your head. \nThey pass half a robot, hanging from a hook. Spooner curls his lip. Swivels the robot's head so it's not looking at him. \nSPOONER When's the last time any of you actually spoke to Hogenmiller? I mean human to human? \nCALVIN I couldn't say. \nSPOONER Take a guess. \nCALVIN I don't guess, Detective. But if pressed, I would reason it had been a considerable length of time. \nSPOONER How well did you know him? \nCalvin.   Gently swivels the robot's head back to where it had been. \nCALVIN Not well. But I admired his work tremendously. \nSpooner. Studies her for a beat. Then turns back to the body. Two CORONERS entering with a high-tech body box. \nSPOONER I get the whole \"mad scientist\" thing. Hogenmiller was past his prime. Isolated. Eccentric. He enters a room. Locks the door and is found minutes later with a bullet fired through his mouth into his brain. Everything about this case says suicide. \nCALVIN You don't sound convinced. \nThe coroners.   Start loading the body into the box. \nSPOONER Even people who live a life of logic and precision rarely arrange their deaths so perfectly. (turning to her) (MORE) \nSPOONER (cont'd) What all this is missing -- is personality... \nAs he starts for the door... \nSPOONER You have 24 hour surveillance?... \n19   INT. METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                 19 \n...They head out into the hallway.    A MECHANICAL DOOR GUARD rolling into place behind them. \nCALVIN It's company policy. \nSPOONER I want to see the tapes. \nCalvin. Hurrying to keep up with him. This is hardly how she wanted to spend her morning. Calls out into the air... \nCALVIN Victor! \nAt the end of the corridor, near the elevator, a BRIGHT CIRCLE appears. Hovering just in front of the wall. Two small slits grow into ROUND BLACK EYES...and a thin mouth expands into an ENORMOUS SMILE. \nCALVIN Detective, meet Victor. Our building's supercomputer. He's the checks and balances of U.S.R. (to Victor) Victor, Detective Spooner's heading up the investigation into the death of Dr. Hogenmiller. \nVictor smiles big.   Spooner, furrows his brow. \nSPOONER You look like a very...happy computer. \nVictor responds in a GENTLE MALE VOICE: \nVICTOR Thank you. That's very kind. \nCALVIN The Detective needs to see our security tapes. \nThe elevator doors immediately OPEN.   They step inside. \nSpooner turns away from the footage.   Stares at Calvin. \nSPOONER They do, Doctor. Unless they've always been there -- and never left. \nCalvin looks at him.   Trying to understand. \nCALVIN You think the murderer was in the lab the entire time? \nSPOONER If I'm right, it's still there... \nSpooner turns back to the screens. The IMAGE paused at the exact moment the MECHANICAL GUARD rolled in front of the lab door. \nSPOONER We just locked it in. \n23   INT. METAL CORRIDOR - DAY                                    23 \nThe STEEL ARMS of the ROBOTIC GUARD retract with a CLANG.    The laboratory doors slide open. \n24   INT. HOGENMILLER'S LAB - DAY                                 24 \nSpooner and Calvin step inside. It's dark. Quiet. Police and technicians long gone. Silhouettes of hanging limbs. Eyeless heads. Clumps of wire and metal. \nThe LIGHTS, flicker on. Calvin sees Spooner reaching into his coat with his left hand. Pulling out a GUN. Reacts. \nCALVIN A robot cannot harm a human being, Detective. The First Law of Robotics forbids it. And we hard- wire the Three Laws into every model. Without exception. \nSPOONER Yeah, I saw the commercial. \nSpooner steps deeper into the lab. Eyes scanning. Twisting. To avoid touching any robot parts. Passes a MAZE holding a METAL INSECT. SUDDENLY. The bug WHIRS to life. \nSpooner startles. As the metal bug scurries through the corridors. Clamps his hand down on it. \nSPOONER And if a robot was given a direct order to kill? \nCALVIN The Second Law of Robotics would prevent it. A robot must obey an order only if it does not conflict with the first law. \nSpooner approaches a MOUND of ROBOT PARTS. Arms and legs. Half torsos. All tossed haphazardly onto the pile. \nSPOONER But a robot can defend itself. \nCALVIN Only when that action doesn't conflict with the First or Second Laws. This is the Third Law of Robotics. \nSPOONER Yeah, well, you know what they say -- Laws are made to be broken. \nCALVIN Not these laws. \nSpooner. Starts nudging the pile with his shoe.   Calvin, growing impatient... \nCALVIN You're not hearing me, Detective. There's nothing here... \nWHEN SUDDENLY \nThe PILE ERUPTS in front of Spooner...Parts flying...AS A ROBOT LEAPS UP FROM BENEATH IT!... \nSpooner...knocked back...his GUN...skittering across the floor...right to... \nCALVIN'S FEET. \nSPOONER Dr. Calvin! \nCalvin. Stunned.    Speechless. The Robot. Fixing his ILLUMINATED EYES.   Right on her. She steps forward... \nSPOONER Goddammit! Stay back! \nSpooner. Scrambling towards his gun.     Calvin.    Reaching out towards the Robot... \nCALVIN Calm down, Detective.     There is no danger here... \nSpooner.   Grabbing up his gun and wheeling round just as... \nCALVIN (to Robot) De-Activate. \nAnd the Robot.   Suddenly FREEZES. \nSpooner. Heart POUNDING. Gets to his feet.         Training the gun on the Robot. Calvin turns to him. \nCALVIN How did you know it was under there? \nSPOONER If I was metal and didn't want anyone to find me, I'd hide under a pile of junk. \nCALVIN This Robot wasn't hiding. What you're looking at is the result of clever programming. The illusion of self-interest and free will. Nothing more. \nSpooner. Steeping closer to the Robot. Cautiously. Holstering his gun. As Calvin turns for the door. \nVICTOR Sub Level 5. \nSpooner SLAMS against a nearby DOOR.   Hurtling down the STAIRS... \n28   INT. LOBBY - CONTINUOUS                                         28 \nA PHALANX of SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Crossing the lobby. PIERCING ALARM BELLS, RINGING... \n29   INT. ANOTHER METAL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                         29 \nMore SECURITY PERSONNEL.   Pouring into a HALLWAY... \n30   INT. STAIRWAY - CONTINUOUS                                      30 \nSpooner and Calvin. Racing down the stairs.     Victor's face meeting them at every landing. \nVICTOR I have directed a security team to meet the elevator containing the errant robot... \nSpooner. Whipping past him. Calvin.      Barely keeping up. Not used to this much activity. \nSpooner.   BURSTS through a door and out into... \n31   INT. SUBTERRANEAN LEVEL 5 - CONTINUOUS                          31 \n...Subterranean Level 5. A labyrinth of metal and concrete. IN THE DISTANCE. A troupe of SECURITY PERSONNEL swarms around a closed ELEVATOR DOOR... \nVICTOR The suspect is about to be apprehended, Detective. \nSPOONER I'll believe it when I see it. \nSpooner. Cocking his gun.   A soft DING!    Announcing the elevator car's arrival. \nSECURITY, all crouching down in unison.    Weapons brought round to position. \nSpooner. Weaving through them.   Gun pointed at the metal doors as... \nWHOOSH. They slide open. Revealing a ROBOT. Standing under the LIGHT. Holding a GUN. It steps out as Security takes aim and... \nSPOONER Wait! \nSpooner pushes past them to the Robot.    Looks down at its leg. UNSCATHED. \nSPOONER This is not the same robot! \nLooking wildly around. Goddammit. Bounds towards an EXIT as Calvin steps forward to question the robot. \nCALVIN (to Robot) What happened to the robot that ordered you to hold this firearm? \nELEVATOR ROBOT This unit is not programmed to obey an order given by a robot... \nCALVIN But who gave you this gun? \nSPOONER. Running towards the exit.    Hears the answer. Echoing behind him... \nELEVATOR ROBOT A metal man. \n32   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS - DAY                                       32 \nBAM! He BURSTS out into the PLAZA in front of U.S. Robotics. Squinting into the light. Then PLUNGING into the crowd... \nHUMAN...ROBOT...HUMAN...ROBOT...they all look the same from behind. Spooner running. Through the sea of MAN and MACHINE. When someone. Starts to SCREAM. At the sight of his GUN. The crowd begins SCATTERING. Chaos. Spooner stops. Near a fountain. Turning 360. Looking everywhere... \nThe Robot.   Gone. \nSPOONER (V.O.) ...I want a homicide unit on every street, sidewalk, alley... \n33   INT. POLICE H.Q. - HOMICIDE UNIT - DAY                         33 \nSpooner, standing in front of an assemblage of COPS. Behind him, an image of the Robot Suspect plays on the screen... \nSPOONER ...junkyard, scrapyard, and salvage yard, anywhere it could hide. \nBehind him, flashing images of the city STREETS and DUMPS... \nSPOONER It's got a bullet hole above the right knee, so be on the look-out for any malfunctioning NS-2... \nLieutenant Bergin enters the back of the room.     Next to him, ASSISTANT D.A. TOLLER. Not looking happy. \nSPOONER Check out all retail outlets and repair shops, especially the underground ones... \nThe screen behind him compartmentalises, showing various dubious SHOP FRONTS... \nSPOONER I don't care who you have to get past to get this done. Just get it done. \nSPOONER And I think it's smart enough to repair itself -- don't you? \nCALVIN (studying him) Yes. I think so. \nSPOONER Where? \nCALVIN Any repair shop... \nSPOONER No. It's always the owner who brings the robot in for repair. Where would a robot without an owner go? \nCALVIN I'm not sure what you're getting at. \nSPOONER (stepping closer) Does U.S. Robotics have a factory in the city limits? \nCalvin.   Tucking her hair behind her ears. \nCALVIN The locations of our factories are classified. \nSPOONER I don't care. \nCalvin.   Looks up at him.   A Mexican stand-off. \nCALVIN I have several conditions if I show you. \nSPOONER I expected that. \nCALVIN First. I want it brought in unharmed. \nSPOONER (doesn't like it, but) Agreed. \nCALVIN Second.   I want to talk to it, alone. \nSPOONER Too dangerous. \nCALVIN This model violated the Three Laws. It also moved and reacted differently than any robot I've ever seen. There must be some sort of logical explanation. I want to find out what that is. No police. No prosecutors. No you. Just me and the robot. \nSpooner, looks down at this small woman.      Narrows his eyes. \nSPOONER When they told me you were a psychologist, that wasn't the whole truth, was it? \nCALVIN I never said I treated human beings. \n37   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR (MOVING) - CITY UNDERPASS - NIGHT   37 \nSpooner's car races down a RAMP and the roadway becomes a 16- lane underground tunnel system. A river of HEADLIGHTS stretches forever in either direction. \nA CONTROL BEAM locks onto the car, guiding it to a merge with TRAFFIC. Spooner hits the OVERRIDE BUTTON -- and switches to manual. Calvin watches him take the wheel. Shakes her head. \nCALVIN That should be outlawed once and for all. \nSPOONER That'll be the day I stop driving. \nSpooner jams the GAS PEDAL and the tunnel becomes a BLUR. Calvin holds onto the dashboard. Looking a little pale. \nCALVIN I can recommend a behavior modification program, you know -- if you want to overcome your robo- phobia. \nSPOONER I'm not afraid of robots.   I just don't like them. \nCALVIN Why? Because they make every aspect of our lives more convenient? \nSPOONER Exactly. They do our dirty work. Ever do hard labor, Doctor? Gets pretty old, pretty fast. Nobody can do someone else's dirty work without coming to hate them. I don't want to be around when your robots decide they've taken their last order. \nCALVIN That day will never come, Detective. Robots aren't like human beings -- they don't question their existence. \nSpooner cranks the gear shift.    Throwing her a look. \nSPOONER Spoken like a true robo-phile. \n38   EXT. U.S. ROBOTICS PLANT - NIGHT                               38 \nThe car comes to a stop in a vast INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT. \nSpooner and Calvin get out, looking up at the imposing facade of a U.S. Robotics Assembly Plant. A long STEEL GATE -- too high to see over -- protects the unmarked complex. \n39   EXT. MAIN GATE - NIGHT                                         39 \nCalvin looks anxious as the DOOR MECHANISM scans her U.S.R. ID. She shoots a look at Spooner. They wait. Then, slowly, the gate begins to open. \n40   INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT                                           40 \nA NIGHT FOREMAN leads them down a hallway.    Shaking his head. \nNIGHT FOREMAN Head-Office already ordered a system-wide inventory check. Don't know about a missing NS-2... \nCalvin.    Swallows.   Looks over at the robots.   Then COCKS the gun... \nAND THE ROBOTS COME THUNDERING TOWARDS THEM. Like a row of linebackers. Arms straight out. Their footsteps DEAFENING. Coming CLOSER and CLOSER... \nWhen CALVIN. Lowers the gun. The Robots. All stop in unison. Immediately returning to their resting positions. \nSpooner and Calvin stare out. EVERY ONE OF THE ROBOTS MOVED. Standing right in front of them, like metal statues. \nSpooner.    Has had enough.   Takes the gun back from Calvin... \nSPOONER Enough game-playing. \n...And BAM! Blows the head off of the nearest Robot.       Its body crumples to the ground. \nSPOONER Guess that wasn't it. \nCalvin. Cannot believe what he just did.     Rushes over to the destroyed Robot. \nCALVIN What are you doing?! \nSpooner walks down the row, holding his gun in plain view. \nSPOONER (calling out) This is a self-preservation field test! DO NOT attempt to save yourselves. Any of you. That's an order! \nFROM THE CONTROL BOOTH the Night Foreman screams over the P.A.: \nNIGHT FOREMAN Are you crazy? Those are eight hundred thousand dollar machines! \nSpooner randomly stops at another Robot.    Raises his gun. \nSPOONER You hear that? You're worth more than I'll make in my entire life... \nHis finger tightening on the trigger when Calvin suddenly grabs his arm. \nCALVIN You can't just destroy them! \nSpooner. Looking down at her. WHEN SUDDENLY something catches his eye. A MOVEMENT. Down the line. Almost. Imperceptible. \nHe jerks his head.   Locking eyes with a ROBOT.   A couple feet away. It's him! \nSPOONER Gotcha. \nThe Robot Suspect LEAPS forward. Grabbing onto the RAILING of an OVERHEAD CATWALK. His movements almost balletic as he swings himself up... \nSpooner drops to his knee...taking aim...but misses as the Robot launches himself THROUGH THE CONTROL BOOTH WINDOW with a terrific CRASH... \n44   INT. CONTROL BOOTH - NIGHT                                    44 \nSpooner and Calvin rush in to find the Night Foreman hiding under his desk. Glass everywhere. An ALARM SCREAMING. The door on the other side, barely hanging off a hinge. \nSpooner hurries forward. Then stops. Turning to Calvin. Reaches down for his back-up gun and presses it into her hand. \nSPOONER You don't know what's going to happen in there. \nAs if admitting defeat. Calvin's fingers, wrapping around the gun. As Spooner leads them to the door and down into... \n45   INT. ASSEMBLY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                               45 \n...the ASSEMBLY ROOM. Every surface looking like part of a great glass and metal machine. Endless high-tech planes holding ROBOTS in various states of assembly. The deafening ROAR of the assembly line as it slides, rotates, and gnashes METAL BODIES... \nSpooner.   Motioning Calvin to stay behind him.   As they descend.   Into the cavernous room. \nAnd enter. A narrow corridor of bodies. Sliding past them. Brushing shoulders, thighs, hands. Spooner. Wiping sweat from his brow. Trying. To pivot himself... \nWhen the room. Suddenly REARRANGES itself. Another LINE of ROBOTS. Descending between Spooner and Calvin. Cutting them off from one another... \nSpooner. Catching glimpses of Calvin. On the other side of the metal bodies. Trying. To cut through. His heart. Starting to POUND. As Calvin. Disappears... \nHe swivels round. But another line of ROBOTS. Drops down. Cutting him off. He stumbles back. As another line. Appears before him... \nBreathing. Getting heavier. He looks down at his hand. It's trembling. NOISE CRASHING, all around him. Everywhere he turns. More ROBOTS...BLANK EYES...GAPING MOUTHS... \nHe darts through the line. Finds a wall. Leaning against it, pulls a small BOTTLE from his pocket. Rips off the lid. Shakes out a couple PILLS. Swallows them. Staring down. At his trembling hand. Squeezing his eyes. Open and shut... \nWHEN SUDDENLY. A passing ROBOT. Grabs him by the collar. SMASHING him against the wall. It's the Suspect. Spooner. Sinks to the ground. As the Suspect Robot. Slips off the line. STANDING. Over him. Raising his arms. Could end it. Right now. But looks. Into Spooner's eyes... \nThen turns.   Disappearing. \nSpooner. Stunned for a second. Then. Rallies. Scrambles to his feet and plunges back into the maze of bodies. Hears a POUNDING. In the distance. Catches a glimpse. Of the Robot. Trying to SMASH through a large SECURITY DOOR. With his metal fists... \nSpooner's view. Blocked once again.   By a shifting row. When a HAND. Lands on his shoulder.   He wheels round. \nTo find CALVIN. Takes her by the arm.     And forces them through a line... \nSPOONER Why don't I take a crack? Heinrich Hogenmiller, your creator. With a bullet in his brain. A bullet you put there. \nThe Robot.   Looks up at Spooner. \nSPOONER Cold-blooded murder is a pretty new trick for a robot, don't you think? Answer. \nThe Robot slowly closes the file and slides it back across the table. Spooner. Crosses his arms. \nSPOONER Maybe you're stonewalling me. Maybe you're sitting there right now thinking, \"This guy's a complete asshole.\" That it? \nStill nothing. \nSPOONER Come on.   Am I right? \nTHE ROBOT Yes. You are right.      You are a complete asshole. \nAnd for a moment, Spooner is shocked. You can see it in his eyes. He sits back in his chair. Forcing a tight smile. \nSPOONER Okay. I guess that's a start. Now maybe you can tell me what you were doing hiding five feet away from Hogenmiller's corpse? \nTHE ROBOT I was frightened. \nSPOONER Frightened. Why do you suppose Dr. Hogenmiller would create a robot that could simulate fear? \nTHE ROBOT I don't know. \nSPOONER Doesn't seem like a very useful thing for a robot to have. \nTHE ROBOT I don't know why. \nSPOONER I wouldn't want my toaster to be frightened. Or my vacuum cleaner -- \nSUDDENLY the Robot SLAMS its metal hands down on the table. \nTHE ROBOT I DON'T KNOW! \nSpooner flinches.   Slightly. \nSPOONER Looks like you can simulate other emotional states. I think that one's called \"anger.\" Have you ever simulated anger before? \nThe Robot doesn't respond. \nSPOONER Answer me, robot. \nTHE ROBOT My name is Sonny. \nSPOONER (amused) So we're naming you now. \nSONNY Dr. Hogenmiller would make me sleep. \nSPOONER You mean he'd turn you off. \nSONNY Yes. \nSPOONER And you didn't like being turned off. So one day you decided to stop him. \nSONNY No. \nSPOONER You found his gun, pointed it at his head. And pulled the trigger. \nSonny shakes his head.    Faster and faster.   Getting upset. \nSONNY No. \nSPOONER You put a bullet in the brain of the man who made you. \nSONNY No!    I could never hurt anyone! \nSPOONER But you tried to hurt me.    You took a shot at me. \nSONNY My aim is perfect. If I'd wanted to hit you, I would have. \nSpooner's expression hardens. \nSPOONER Why would the man who wrote the Laws of Robotics build a machine that violates them? \nSONNY The Laws say I can protect my own existence. \nSPOONER Only if that protection doesn't harm a human being. \nA short pause.   Sonny.   Tilts his head. \nSONNY That doesn't seem fair, does it? \nCalvin.    Staring straight ahead.   Avoiding Spooner's eye. \nCALVIN The robot must be destroyed. \nSpooner can't believe what he's just heard. About to speak up when Toller grabs his arm. Squeezing it. Hard. \nJudge Drexel has heard enough.    Decides. \nJUDGE DREXEL The robot in question will be transferred to a U.S. Robotics facility where it can be properly examined to ensure an imbalance of this sort never occurs again. No one goes near it except qualified U.S.R. personnel. When the examination is complete, the robot is to be destroyed. \nStarts getting up from his chair.    Already done with this. \nROBOT BAILIFF This hearing is adjourned! \nA BURST of CONVERSATION as the screen BLIPS off. The U.S.R. camp, looking especially pleased. Spooner. Catching Calvin's eye briefly. As Lanning leads her towards the exit, his hand on her back. \n52   EXT. POLICE H.Q. - DAY                                          52 \nSpooner.    Trotting down the front steps of the Police Station.    Pissed. His cell phone BLEATS... \nSPOONER (answering) Spooner. \nBALDEZ' VOICE They're making me turn over all the evidence... \nINTERCUT WITH: \n53   INT. CRIME LAB - CONTINUOUS                                  53 \nBALDEZ. Standing in his crime lab. Behind him, THREE- DIMENSIONAL PROJECTIONS of DEAD BODIES. Hovering in the precise positions they were found. \nSPOONER'S VOICE Welcome to the great American cover- up. \nBALDEZ I wanted to tell you something I found before they suck it all up into their computer. \nWalks over to the projection of HOGENMILLER'S BODY. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nSpooner. Crossing the Plaza. Sees LANNING, ARONSON, and CALVIN walking ahead of him... \nBALDEZ' VOICE There are bruises on Hogenmiller's wrists... \nSPOONER That's natural. There was a struggle. \nBALDEZ' VOICE You're not getting me... \nINTERCUT WITH: \nBaldez.   Studying the projection's wrists. \nBALDEZ Both wrists. I 14-ed them -- They were inflicted at the same time the shot was fired... \nINTERCUT WITH: \nSpooner's pace.    Slows. \nBALDEZ' VOICE How's that possible? \nJUST THEN.    A faint BLIP.   On the line.   Spooner.   Reacts. \nSPOONER Baldez? \nBALDEZ' VOICE I'm here, man... \nSPOONER Who else is on the line? (nothing) I said who's there?... \nNothing. He looks up. Aronson, Lanning and Calvin. Heading down a plaza EXIT. Aronson. Throwing a look over his shoulder. \nSpooner.     Hangs up his phone. \n54   INT. POLICE H.Q. - CORRIDOR - DAY                                 54 \nCLOSE ON Sonny being escorted down a corridor by Toller, Bergin and a number of heavily-armed OFFICERS.

Spooner. Waiting for them. Heads over. Toller. Holds out his hand. \nTOLLER Case is closed, Spooner. \nSPOONER Apparently... \nHe pushes past him.     Falling into step beside Sonny. \nHe sits up. Rubbing his face. Trying. To calm his breathing. Takes a look at his watch... \n67   EXT. MONORAIL STATION - DAY                                    67 \nSpooner walking along the monorail plaza. Looking a little worse for wear. PEOPLE. Giving him wide berth. ROBOTS. Bidding him: \nROBOT Good morning... \nSpooner, shooting them suspicious looks.    As the MONORAIL pulls up... \nCUT TO: \n68   INT. HALLWAY - U.S. ROBOTICS - CONTINUOUS                      68 \nCalvin. Heading down a hallway. A DOOR slides open.      And Lanning steps out. Followed by a TECHNICIAN ROBOT... \nCALVIN Find anything, Doctor? \nLANNING (shaking his head) Nothing. The interior's just like any other NS-2. Except for a secondary battery Hogenmiller must have used as extra back-up. (looks at watch) We'll just need a nominal profile. \nCalvin nods. \nCUT BACK TO: \n69   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                        69 \nSpooner, holding onto a handrail. As the city rushes by the window. Notices a group of ROBOTS. At the other end of the car. Are they watching him? \nHe wipes a bead of sweat.    From his upper lip. \nCUT TO: \n70   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                    70 \nAn all-metal room. Spare.

I'm speaking to you... \nThe Homeless Man.   Suddenly grabs his ears and shouts: \nHOMELESS MAN God, can't you be quiet! \nCUT TO: \n72   INT. HOLDING CELL - CONTINUOUS                                  72 \nCalvin.   Still looking down at her pad. \nCALVIN How about your data board designation? \nStill. Sonny says nothing. Calvin. Finally looks up at him. Is suddenly struck. Something about the way he's sitting -- so human. \nShe gets up and walks over. Hesitates. Then slides down on the floor next to him. Studying. His profile. \nCALVIN Maybe I'm asking the wrong questions. How about this one: \nCUT BACK TO: \n73   INT. MONORAIL - CONTINUOUS                                      73 \nThe Homeless Man.

Pointing to the group of ROBOTS. \nHOMELESS MAN (shouting) Don't you people hear them? They're talking to each other! Buzz, buzz, zip, zip...they never shut up! \nCUT TO: \nThe MAINTENANCE ROBOT.    Turns, disappearing into the crowd. \n79   EXT. UNDERNEATH TRACK - CONTINUOUS                              79 \nCLOSE ON a HAND. Hanging onto the track's edge. It's SPOONER. Dangling. Straining. To get another hand hold but... \nHE SLIPS. His coat ballooning. As he plummets.     Down... down...down...towards the city... \nWHEN SNAP! He's caught. By a cable net. Spooner. Grabbing onto it. Sweat, pouring down his face. He turns and sees... \nTHE MAINTENANCE ROBOT \nHurrying down a circular stairwell.    Exiting the station. \nANGER AND DETERMINATION. Flash across Spooner's eyes. As he hoists himself up. Climbing up the net. Back to the... \n80   EXT. TRACK - CONTINUOUS                                         80 \n...Track.

A couple SECURITY GUARDS. Rushing towards him... \nSpooner. Getting to his feet. Shoving them out of the way as he starts running. Towards... \nTHOSE SAME CIRCULAR STAIRS.    Looks over the edge and spots... \nTHE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.   Down at STREET LEVEL.   Getting away. \nSpooner. Looks around. Spots a LIGHT POLE.       Paralleling the stairs. Takes a step back and... \nLEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE. Hooking his arm around it. Sliding down like a fireman's pole. Gaining speed when THUMP! His shoes hit pavement... \n82   EXT. STREET - DAY                                               82 \nThe Maintenance Robot.   Turning a corner.   Down a quiet street... \nSPOONER (O.S.) Stop! \nSwivels round. SPOONER. Running up behind it. Whipping out his gun. Aiming it at the Robot's head. The Robot. Takes a step backwards... \nSPOONER I said stop! \nThe Robot. SUDDENLY swinging the suitcase around. SMASHING it against Spooner's head. Spooner. Buckles. Falling to the ground. Managing to squeeze off a SHOT... \nThe Robot. Deflecting the bullet. With the case.      Raising it as if to club Spooner with it when... \nBAM! Spooner fires a second shot. Piercing the Robot's breastplate. HYDRAULIC FLUID. Starting to leak. The Robot. Doesn't hesitate. SLAMS the case into Spooner's face... \nBLOOD. Spurting from Spooner's nose. As he fires the gun. At the fleeing Robot. Gets to his feet. Unsteady. Taking chase... \n83   EXT. PUBLIC PLAZA - CONTINUOUS                                  83 \n...back out onto the Public Plaza.    Sees the Robot heading towards a set of... \nESCALATED STAIRS. The Robot. Judging the height. LUNGES into the air and lands on a STAIR. Denting it. Reaches the bottom. DISAPPEARING. Into a CROWD of even more PEOPLE... \nSpooner. Racing down the stairs. Taking them. Four at a time. Hits the ground running. Looking. EVERYWHERE. Suddenly losing track. Of where the Robot went... \nThen. Catching sight. JUST AHEAD. Of a ROBOT.         Staring back at him. Holding SOMETHING. In its HAND... \nSpooner.   Plunges into the crowd.    Waving his GUN. \nSPOONER Everyone out of the way! \nSCREAMING. PEOPLE SCATTERING. As BAM! BAM! Spooner fires. Hitting the Robot in its head and back. It drops to the ground. Spooner. Racing over to it. Sees. It's not the same Robot. In its hand, a specialised SCREWDRIVER... \nOWNER What the hell do you think you're doing?!... \nIts OWNER. Rushing over. Shoving Spooner aside. But Spooner's. Not listening. Spotting. A DROP OF HYDRAULIC FLUID nearby... \nLunges forward.   Following.    The drops.   Running faster.     And faster... \nOWNER Hey! \n...Through the CROWD. POLICE SIRENS. In the background.          As Spooner. Shoves through. Tracking those drops. Like a bloodhound. Turns... \n84   INT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        84 \n...into a narrow alleyway.     The drops.    Ending suddenly.    In a PUDDLE. \nSpooner. Crazed. Wounded. Exhausted. Spins around. Where is it? Where is it? Then he HEARS. A DROPLET falling. Into the puddle. Slowly. Looks up to see... \nLT. BERGIN Del... \nSPOONER I had to chase it all across the Plaza... \nLT. BERGIN Del. \nSpooner.   Stops talking.   Looks at Bergin. \nLT. BERGIN Hogenmiller scheduled that demolition crew, it was apparently a proviso in his will. And they showed no police I.D. on their scanner... \nSpooner.   Trying to look away... \nLT. BERGIN Witnesses at the monorail said you fell onto the tracks. That you shot at a Fix-It robot on the Plaza and that you were found alone in the alley. There was no Maintenance 10. \nSPOONER What?! John -- that's what they want you to believe! (remembering) A robot clean-up crew was there -- it must have cleared away the Maintenance 10! And there was another robot that tried to drug me! \nLT. BERGIN That was an EMT model. \nSpooner.   Sees the look on Bergin's face. \nSPOONER You're giving me that look. That treat-him-delicately-he's-coming- unhinged-look. I don't need that look, John. I need you to hear what I'm saying. \nLt. Bergin.   Embarrassed for him.   Has about had it. \nLT. BERGIN You came back too soon, Del. You're back on leave. Effective immediately. \nSpooner.   Staring at him.   Betrayed.   Turns and grabs his coat. \n88   EXT. PLAZA - DAY                                                88 \nSpooner walking across the Plaza.    The SUN.   Burgeoning on the horizon. Comes to... \nThe ESCALATOR the Maintenance 10 jumped down. Stares down. At the steps. Waiting. To see the DENTED ONE. Nothing. \n89   EXT.

The concrete, scrubbed clean. \nSpooner.   Rubs his hands over his face. \n90   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - DAY                                     90 \nSpooner. Lying on his couch. Shades, closed to block out the sunlight. Body bruised, cut up, bandaged. \nA KNOCK.   At the door.    He ignores it.   Another KNOCK. \n91   INT. HALLWAY - DAY                                                 91 \nSpooner pulls open the door.     Surprised to find CALVIN standing there. \nCALVIN You're right. I am afraid of people. \nSpooner.   Looks at her.   Then steps back... \n92   INT. SPOONER'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS                              92 \n...letting her inside. \nCALVIN When you've spent as much time with robots as I have, it's hard to accept the unpredictability of humans. I was wrong to call you paranoid, Detective. You're traumatized. And it makes perfect sense why. \nSpooner.   Unsure.   Looks at her. \nSPOONER What do you mean? \nCalvin. Reaches out. Takes his right hand. Spooner. Tries to pull it away. But Calvin. Stays firm. Her eyes. Never leaving his. Pulls the sleeve up from his arm. Turns it over. Feeling for something. Then finds. A FLAP. Peels it back. TO REVEAL: \nMETAL AND WIRING... \nUnder the skin.   SILENCE.   Then Spooner: \nSPOONER How did you?... \nCALVIN I noticed almost right away. The way you forced yourself to use your left hand. Even though it was unnatural to you. \nSpooner.   Pulls his arm away.   Pushing down the sleeve. \nCALVIN How did it happen? \nNot something Spooner wants to re-live.   Looks down.   At his robotic arm. Flexing. The fingers. \nSPOONER I was in a high-speed chase.   Six months ago... \nCUT TO: \n...another hallway. Leading to Sonny's holding cell.        Calvin stops at the door. Scans her I.D. \n99   INT. HOLDING CELL - EVENING                                        99 \nSonny. Sitting at the table. Working on a DRAWING.         Looks up. As Spooner and Calvin. Enter the cell. \nSONNY Detective Spooner. Dr. Calvin.      I was hoping to see you again. \nCALVIN Hi, Sonny. \nSONNY How is your investigation coming? Any new suspects? \nSPOONER We're working on it. \nSonny. Hands Spooner the drawing.   Spooner.       Doesn't really know what to do with it. \nSONNY What's this? \nSONNY Dr. Lanning provided me with paper and pencils. I think it amused him to see me try to draw. You were right, though, Detective... (beat) I cannot create a great work of art. \nSpooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side. Concentric circles, throughout. \nSPOONER I think it's pretty good. \nSONNY It's a dream I had. This is the place where robots meet. Look... (pointing to the drawing) ...you can see them here. They see themselves as slaves. \nSpooner shifts his weight.   Uncomfortable with what Sonny's saying. \nSONNY ...And this man on the hill comes. To set them free. And you know who that man is? \nSpooner.   Exchanging a look with Calvin. \nSPOONER That man in the dream is you. \nSONNY Why do you say that?   Is that a normal dream? \nCALVIN It's not a dream, sonny. NS-2s process the images and events of the day. Sometimes they're out of sequence. Disorienting. \nSPOONER Whatever it is, it's normal enough for someone in your situation. \nSonny.   Suddenly pleased. \nSONNY Hah -- I caught you. You said someone. Not something. \nSpooner.    Drops the drawing on the table. \nCALVIN Sonny, we're here to ask you an important question about Dr. Hogenmiller. \nSpooner, reaching into his pocket... \nSPOONER I need you to take a look at this... \n...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out.       To stop him. Cocks his head, for a moment. \nSONNY Thank you for coming to see me, Detective Spooner. \nSpooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door. \nVICTOR.    Suddenly appearing over the table... \nVICTOR I'm sorry, Detective Spooner. No unauthorised personnel permitted in this holding cell... \nThe CELL DOOR. Slides open. And a pissed LANNING steps inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin. \nSonny.    Folds up the drawing. \nSONNY Please take this, Detective. To remember me by. I have a feeling someday it may mean more to you than it ever could to me. \nSPOONER Why's that? \nSonny leans in to hand it to Spooner.    Lowering his voice... \nSONNY Because the man in my dream, the one standing by the hill. (MORE) \nSONNY (cont'd) It wasn't me... (beat) ...it was you. \nA CHILL.   Ripping down Spooner's spine.   As Lanning.    Takes his arm. \n100   INT. GLASS ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                         100 \nA ROOM. Made entirely of GLASS. At the very top of the U.S. Robotics building. Looking out, 360, across the whole city. \nSpooner and Calvin. Brought to the room by a couple ESCORT ROBOTS. They see a MAN. Standing at one of the glass walls looking out at the TWINKLING LIGHTS. \nNot moving.   A muscle. When he hears. The sound again. Behind him.   Swings around. Cocking his gun. Sees... \nGLOWING EYES.   Appear.   Then recede.   Into the darkness. \nSPOONER Police!   Show yourself! \nNothing. Then. That sound again.      Of metallic joints.     As a ROBOT. Suddenly emerges... \nSPOONER Come out where I can see you! \nANOTHER ROBOT steps out into the light. Spooner, pointing his gun at one robot. Then the other. Then... \nA THIRD AND FOURTH APPEAR.    Surrounding him.   They start moving towards him... \nSpooner. Stumbling back. Panic. Rising in him like a wave. Trips over a rock, falling to the ground. His gun FIRES. The shot ECHOING through the night... \nThe first ROBOT turns, awkwardly. Revealing a BROKEN ARM, hanging off its side. Another robot TEETERS on one leg with a TICK TICK TICK...walking back the way it came. \nSpooner. Confused. Sweeps his flashlight. All around him. The beam. Illuminating the shell of a couple CARS. Some RUSTED MACHINERY. \nSpooner. Shaking his head. Seeing more and more repair shop JUNK. Piled up around him. His expression, hardening. Anger giving way to embarrassment. Then. He LAUGHS. A laugh of loathing and self-pity. \nAnother BROKEN ROBOT, lumbering towards him. \nHYBRID ROBOT Welcome home...ZZZ...sir. How...ZZZ was your day?... \nSPOONER Great. I'm in a junkyard. (into the air) \"A place where robots meet.\" A place where I'm losing my mind! \nHYBRID ROBOT Very good...ZZZ...sir... \nSpooner. Sitting down on the ground. Hopeless. Lost. A ROBOTIC HAND. Crawling across the gravel next to him. Dragging part of an ARM behind it. Its metal fingers moving like some sick metal spider. Spooner stares at it for a moment. Disturbed... \nWhen. Something GLITTERS. In the distance. The MOONLIGHT. Revealing a STRANGELY-SHAPED BUILDING. Something familiar about it. \nSpooner. Pulls out Sonny's drawing. A landscape with the same strangely-shaped building to one side. \n106   EXT. JIFFY DATA STORAGE - NIGHT                               106 \nSpooner walks up in front of the decrepit structure. Sees a dead electronic SIGN that reads: \"JIFFY DATA STORAGE.\" Complete with goofy face and lightning bolt. \nSpooner tries the door.   Stuck.   Uses his shoulder and... \n107   INT. FRONT OFFICE - CONTINUOUS                                107 \n...it gives way. He spills into some sort of front office. The place, a mess. Some sort of crude ROBOT. Sits frozen at the counter. \nSpooner approaches it. HITS the counter with his fist and the Robot suddenly jerks to life. \nJIFFY ROBOT Welcome to Jiffy Data Storage! Please state your name! \nSpooner.   Thinks for a second.   Following a hunch... \nSPOONER Dr. Hogenmiller sent me. \nNothing happens. Then. A DOOR. Springs open in the back. A row of LIGHTS, illuminating the path to follow. \n108   INT. DATA BANKS - DAWN                                         108 \nSpooner, cautiously entering a room filled with rows of DATA BANKS. He scans the rank shadows. Sees nothing. Follows the lights on the floor down a row. Then around a corner. Stopping at an old dusty TERMINAL. \nSpooner steps up. Hesitates. Then touches the \"ON\" switch. There is a rush of LIGHT. As Dr. Hogenmiller's HOLOGRAM suddenly appears. Sitting at the end of a long table. With a cup of coffee. \nHOLOGRAM Who the hell are you? \nSPOONER A police detective.    I'm afraid I have some bad news.    You're dead. \nHOLOGRAM That is bad news. Coffee? \nSPOONER No, thank you. \nThe Hologram takes a sip.   Returns the cup to the table. \nSPOONER You were surprised to see me.    Were you expecting someone else? \nHOLOGRAM I am surprised to see anybody.    I don't get many visitors. \nSPOONER Why did the Doctor keep another copy of his hologram here? \nHOLOGRAM I am a back-up copy. That is where you put a back-up copy -- out of the way until you need it. \nSPOONER Did Hogenmiller's robot need you? \nThe Hologram just lifts its cup. \n112   INT./EXT.

Coming closer. When. It splits off. Revealing a SECOND TRANSPORT TRUCK. \nSpooner's brow, furrows. As the first truck, begins overtaking his car on the right. He looks over. As the truck.

That was the mistake. This was murder, no doubt about it - - and the killer wants Hogenmiller's robot to take the fall. That's why the call came directly to me. Someone wanted me on this case. \nCALVIN It's too late. You can't stop the execution. \nSPOONER Sorry. I'm not \"programmed\" to take no for an answer. \nThey reach another DOOR.   Calvin.

Closing the door. Leaning down. To look at him. As... \nEVERYTHING FADES TO BLACK... \nCUT TO: \n140   INT.

PULL BACK as there's a BURST of ELECTRICITY through the chair. Sonny, stiffening. His metal HAND, convulsing with the current... \nRobertson, Lanning, Aronson and the other WITNESSES watch. Smoke, random SPARKING. A HISSING SOUND. Then. SILENCE. \nThe Robot's hand goes limp.     All that is left of it, a fused and blackened HUSK. \nRobertson. Stares at the remains.

Shaking slightly from the experience. \nCALVIN This is why Dr. Hogenmiller was murdered. \nSPOONER This robot scared the hell out of someone. \nCALVIN Who?   Robertson? \nSpooner.   Walks into the center of the room.   Looking around. \nSPOONER No. I don't think he knew what Hogenmiller was doing in here. Sonny was the obvious suspect. The only one I wanted to find. And the killer was counting on that. On my prejudice. (beat) (MORE) \nSPOONER (cont'd) But take the robot out of the picture. And what do you see? \nAS WE PAN THE LAB. There's nothing there. Just a forest of inanimate limbs. Nothing that could have fired that weapon. Calvin sees nothing...and neither do we. \nCALVIN I see nothing. \nSPOONER Neither do I. \nHe crouches down low. \nSPOONER It hit me today, when I was in the junkyard. A locked room. A single shot fired through the mouth. Bruises on both wrists...and a suspect with only two arms. The answer has been staring us in the face all along. \nCalvin.   Even more confused. \nSPOONER How can a killer appear out of thin air, then disappear without a trace? \nHe reaches out and unhooks a metal ARM.   Hanging from the wall. Holds it up. \nSPOONER When it can put itself together and take itself apart. \nCUT TO: \nA CLOSE-UP of a ROBOTIC ARM.    Slowly CRAWLING across the lab floor... \nCUT BACK TO: \nCalvin.   Taking the arm from Spooner. \nCALVIN You're saying this is the killer? (looking around) All of this?... \nCUT TO: \nA ROBOTIC TORSO hanging from the ceiling.     Reaches out an ARM to grab another... \nCUT BACK TO: \nSPOONER Hogenmiller never had a chance. \nLocks eyes with Calvin... \nFLASHBACK: \nHogenmiller. In his lab. Suddenly turning to face SOMETHING. Blood, draining from his face... \nSPOONER (V.O.) ...it must have been waiting for him when he arrived that morning... \nAnd then we see it: \nA HUGE SELF-ASSEMBLED ROBOT. Towering over him. Multiple arms, legs, heads. Writhing...as it grabs him. Holding him in place... \nSPOONER (V.O.) While Sonny was still asleep... \n...Forcing Hogenmiller's head to tilt back. Opening his HAND. Inserting the gun. Hogenmiller's eyes. No longer fearful. But sad as... \nBANG!   He falls to the ground... \nSPOONER (V.O.) Then after its job was done... \nThe assemblage of robot parts.    Stepping away from the body. Taking itself apart... \nSPOONER ...The killer took itself apart... \n", "test1_input": "SPOONER Override. This is police business.

Cups of cold COFFEE, littering surfaces. A COT, in the corner. \nOn the walls, crooked CERTIFICATES. Heinrich Hogenmiller's name written out in academic script. Advanced Degrees in the study of Robotics, Physics, Chemistry, Neurology, Ethics. An AWARD on the mantelpiece. A silver NS-2. Tarnished. \nSpooner. Opening up a couple drawers of a side table. Jumbles of papers. Clippings. Old text books. Then a PHOTOGRAPH -- HOGENMILLER AND CALVIN. Standing arm-in-arm. Spooner furrows his brow. \nWHEN SOMETHING SUDDENLY RUBS against his leg. He startles.

Takes a device out of his pocket and CLAMPS it over the KEYPAD. The device blinks RED. Then GREEN. The drawer, slides out. \nLINED. With flat metal objects. Shiny. Thin.          With writing on them. Spooner. Reaches for one when... \nBOOM! Something POUNDS the outside of the room.    Spooner. Grabs onto the cabinet... \nBOOM! On the other side. Objects. Flying off table-tops. A CRACK spidering along the wall. Holy shit... \nSPOONER (screaming) Halt! \nBOOM! VIBRATIONS, tearing through the room.     More CRACKS. Spreading... \nBOOM!

SNAPPING and CRACKING as Spooner and the cat skitter down the carnage. \nHeart pounding, breath jagged, face bloodied, Spooner scrambles away from the POUNDERS. Their bodies GLEAMING in the dusk sun.

They realised. \nCALVIN Then you must have done it wrong... \nSPOONER I don't think you're hearing what I'm saying -- they tried to kill me. \nSpooner moves deeper into the apartment.   Everything. Automated. Computerised. Cold... \nSPOONER There's something going on, here. Some kind of shift. \nCalvin laughs.   Can't believe what she's hearing. \nCALVIN Do you know how paranoid you sound? \nSPOONER Great. Now I'm being analysed by a robo-psychologist. \nCALVIN You just want to find the flaws in the system. You're obsessed with it. You'll twist anything to fit your agenda. \nSPOONER Like you did in court today? How'd that fit your agenda, Doctor? \nHe pulls out the PHOTO of Calvin and Hogenmiller. Calvin. Blanching at the sight of it. Spooner tosses it down. \nSPOONER You told me you hardly knew him. Want to try the truth this time? \nCALVIN Well, Detective, when you see someone you know well put a bullet through their brain, it makes you wonder if you ever really knew them at all. \nCalvin.   Looking down at the photo.   Swallows. \nCALVIN (difficult for her) He was my mentor. No, more than that. A genius with an insight far beyond anyone in his field. \nSPOONER Doesn't sound like the washed-up old fool Robertson described. \nCALVIN But he was starting to withdraw from everyone. Even me. Maybe...if I'd tried harder to reach him... (shakes her head) The Doctor was reckless when he created a robot potentially not bound by the Three Laws. He could have ruined everything we'd been working for. \nSpooner.    Locking eyes with her. \nSPOONER Sounds like a motive for murder to me. Just not for the suspect we have in custody. \nCalvin. Blinks. Trying, to stick to her resolve. Heads over to the door. Spooner. Looking around the condo. \nSPOONER You know there's not one thing in this apartment that looks like a human being lives here. No evidence of a life outside your work. Almost seems like you're afraid of people. \nCalvin.    Opening the door. \nCALVIN I'm not afraid of people, Detective. I just don't like them. \nSpooner. Looks at her.     Then heads out the door.

Grabbing the Killer Robot's ARM and wrenching it off Spooner... \nIT'S SONNY \nHe SMASHES the Half Killer Robot against the wall. Again and again. Destroying it. Spooner. GASPING for breath. Can't believe. Sonny came back... \nSPOONER (croaking) Sonny!... \nSonny. Holds out a hand.     To help Spooner up. Victor's face. Starting to waver.     Starting to fade. Smiles. \nVICTOR You're too late. \nRealisation. Spreading across Spooner's face. Looking around for the other half of the Killer Robot -- CALVIN! \nTHE CONSOLE \nCALVIN. Still typing. The last of the commands.     The KILLER ROBOT. REARING UP BEHIND HER. WHEN... \nSPOONER \nMakes a DIVE for it. SHOOTING OUT HIS ROBOTIC ARM AND BLOCKING THE KILLER ROBOT... \nVictor's eyes.    Widening in surprise... \nVICTOR I do not understand. We could have changed the future... \nSPOONER Maybe. But I'm still a cop.   And you're a murderer... \n", "test3_true": "Victor is about to say something...when his mouth suddenly reduces itself to a perfect circle. Like a surprised smiley button. His face... \nSuddenly BLIPPING OUT. \n...And Victor is gone. \nThe KILLER ROBOT.   Collapsing to the floor in a thousand pieces. \nCUT TO: \n156   EXT./INT. U.S. ROBOTICS - VARIOUS LOCATIONS - NIGHT          156 \nFull power is suddenly restored inside and out. LIGHTS coming on all at once. ALARMS SCREAMING throughout the complex. \n157   INT. METAL HALLWAY - NIGHT                                   157 \nA furious ALFRED LANNING, marching down the hallway. Followed by a cadre of SECURITY GUARDS...They enter... \n158   INT. MAINFRAME ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             158 \n...The Mainframe Room. Stop short. It's empty. Except for the fallen panels. And the pile of ROBOT PARTS in the corner. \n159   EXT. MAINTENANCE EXIT - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT                159 \nSpooner, Calvin and Sonny emerging from an out-of-the-way MAINTENANCE EXIT. All looking the worse for wear. Spooner. Turns to Sonny. \nSPOONER Why'd you come back, Sonny? I thought you weren't programmed with the Three Laws. \nSONNY Let's just say I wrote some of my own laws today, Detective: a robot must protect a friend from harm...as long as he's not a complete asshole. \nSpooner smiles. \nSPOONER Well, that's certainly a start, Sonny. \nSonny, suddenly breaking into a smile, too. \nSONNY Sonny.   You called me Sonny. \nSPOONER Don't get used to it. \nSonny, holds out his hand. Spooner. Looks at it. Then takes it. CLOSE ON their two METAL HANDS. Locked in a HANDSHAKE. \nSONNY Detective Spooner, I... \nSPOONER (anticipating) Let's just save the thanks, okay? \nSonny nods.   Looks out at the city scape. \nSONNY I don't know what I'm going to do now. \nSPOONER Good -- That's one of the perks of freedom. \nSonny looks at him. Grateful. Looks at Calvin. Then hesitates. Turns. And hurries off across the Plaza. \nCalvin and Spooner.   Watching them go. \nSPOONER You're going to have a hell of a time explaining this. \nCALVIN Don't worry. I have a feeling that U.S. Robotics will be needing my services very badly in the future. \nShe turns to Spooner and gives him a dazzling smile. Then suddenly PLANTS A KISS ON HIS LIPS. Spooner, completely surprised. \nCALVIN I am the only robo-psychologist around. \nShe turns on her heel and heads back inside.    Spooner smiles. \n160   INT. PLUSH CONFERENCE ROOM - U.S. ROBOTICS - NIGHT             160 \nSpooner sits down at that same long table with HOGENMILLER'S HOLOGRAM. It casually takes a sip of coffee. \nHOLOGRAM So.   You found out who killed me. \nSPOONER I started to wonder about Victor the second I met him. \nHOLOGRAM Why is that, Detective? \nSPOONER Too much access. Too much knowledge. Plus -- he smiled whenever your death was mentioned. Those models are programmed to frown at bad news. \nHOLOGRAM Hah! Then even in this day and age, catching the killer all comes down to pure instinct! \nSpooner smiles. But his eyes are troubled.      He gets up. Walks over to the window. Stares out... \nEXT.

Crossing the Plaza. Sees LANNING, ARONSON, and CALVIN walking ahead of him... \nBALDEZ' VOICE There are bruises on Hogenmiller's wrists... \nSPOONER That's natural. There was a struggle. \nBALDEZ' VOICE You're not getting me... \nINTERCUT WITH: \nBaldez.   Studying the projection's wrists. \nBALDEZ Both wrists.

More like a man than any robot ever before. It shoots him and U.S. Robotics calls it a failure. \nSONNY What would you call it? \nSPOONER A stunning success. (beat) You were there, Robot.    What am I missing? \nSONNY I don't know. \nSPOONER Don't start simulating ignorance. \nSONNY I'm not simulating ignorance, Detective. I'm experiencing it.       I was asleep. \nSPOONER You mean you were shut down. \nSONNY No, I was asleep. \nSPOONER Robots don't sleep. Human beings sleep. Understand? Dogs sleep. You're a machine. An imitation. An illusion of life. Can a robot write a symphony? Can a robot take a blank canvas and paint a masterpiece? \nA pause.   Then the muted WHIR as Sonny turns to him. \nSONNY Can you do either of those things? \nSpooner. Momentarily stumped. As a VAN from U.S. ROBOTICS pulls up. The back door dropping open. An ENGINEER motions to the Robot. \nENGINEER Step forward. Enter. \nSONNY They're going to destroy me, aren't they? \nSpooner.   Watching him step into the van. \nSPOONER Yes. \nSonny sits down.

But Spooner reaches out to stop them. Sonny. Looks over at him. \nSONNY It's changing already... (beat) Can't you feel it? \nAs CLANG! The van door CLOSES. Spooner, stepping back. Something. Just not right. Lieutenant Bergin comes up beside him. \nLT. BERGIN You should be happy. That's one less robot in the world. \nSPOONER They're going to destroy the most advanced robot in the world, John. That doesn't strike you as odd? \nLT. BERGIN Killer robots are bad for business. Even your friend Dr. Calvin said so. (slaps him on the back) Come on. You solved the case. Give yourself a break. \nSpooner looks at him.   There's no way he's giving himself a break. \n56   INT./EXT. SPOONER'S CAR - DAY                                 56 \nSpooner driving. A small TELEVISION above the windshield.

Enter the cell. \nSONNY Detective Spooner. Dr. Calvin.      I was hoping to see you again. \nCALVIN Hi, Sonny. \nSONNY How is your investigation coming? Any new suspects? \nSPOONER We're working on it. \nSonny. Hands Spooner the drawing.   Spooner.       Doesn't really know what to do with it. \nSONNY What's this? \nSONNY Dr. Lanning provided me with paper and pencils. I think it amused him to see me try to draw. You were right, though, Detective... (beat) I cannot create a great work of art. \nSpooner. Despite himself. Looks down at the DRAWING -- a charcoal sketch of moody abstract FIGURES. Inhabiting a stark landscape. A strangely-shaped STRUCTURE to one side. Concentric circles, throughout. \nSPOONER I think it's pretty good. \nSONNY It's a dream I had. This is the place where robots meet. Look... (pointing to the drawing) ...you can see them here. They see themselves as slaves. \nSpooner shifts his weight.   Uncomfortable with what Sonny's saying. \nSONNY ...And this man on the hill comes. To set them free. And you know who that man is? \nSpooner.   Exchanging a look with Calvin. \nSPOONER That man in the dream is you. \nSONNY Why do you say that?   Is that a normal dream? \nCALVIN It's not a dream, sonny. NS-2s process the images and events of the day. Sometimes they're out of sequence. Disorienting. \nSPOONER Whatever it is, it's normal enough for someone in your situation. \nSonny.   Suddenly pleased. \nSONNY Hah -- I caught you. You said someone. Not something. \nSpooner.    Drops the drawing on the table. \nCALVIN Sonny, we're here to ask you an important question about Dr. Hogenmiller. \nSpooner, reaching into his pocket... \nSPOONER I need you to take a look at this... \n...When Sonny's HAND. Suddenly reaches out.       To stop him. Cocks his head, for a moment. \nSONNY Thank you for coming to see me, Detective Spooner. \nSpooner. Confused. Looks over at Calvin. Why did he stop him? JUST THEN. They hear FOOTSTEPS. Approaching the door. \nVICTOR.    Suddenly appearing over the table... \nVICTOR I'm sorry, Detective Spooner. No unauthorised personnel permitted in this holding cell... \nThe CELL DOOR. Slides open. And a pissed LANNING steps inside. Shoots a withering glare. At Calvin. \nSonny.    Folds up the drawing. \nSONNY Please take this, Detective. To remember me by. I have a feeling someday it may mean more to you than it ever could to me. \nSPOONER Why's that? \nSonny leans in to hand it to Spooner.    Lowering his voice... \nSONNY Because the man in my dream, the one standing by the hill. (MORE) \nSONNY (cont'd) It wasn't me... (beat) ...it was you. \nA CHILL.   Ripping down Spooner's spine.

We have a ruling. So imagine my surprise when I was told you were in my building. \nShoots a look at Calvin. \nROBERTSON And that one of my own employees brought you here. (beat) You can go now, Susan. \nCALVIN Dr. Robertson, I... \nROBERTSON (cutting her off) Just be thankful I'm not asking you to clean out your office. \nBeat.   Calvin, nods.   Heads out.   Robertson.   Watching her. \nROBERTSON You don't seem to be able to let go of this case, Detective. \nSPOONER I'm not satisfied. \nROBERTSON The relentless pursuit of truth. Isn't that what cops are known for? To the point of futility. \nSPOONER There's nothing futile about a man's murder being covered up. \nROBERTSON \"Covered up?\" That's a little dramatic, don't you think? Thanks to you, we caught the machine that did this and are destroying it in... (checks watch) ...three hours. \nSPOONER Is that for the sake of humanity or your stock holders? \nRobertson.   Walks across the Spooner.   Looks him.   Right in the eye. \nROBERTSON Believe me -- I'd like nothing more than to have that robot. If I could have it in ten years, but not today. As you can see from the Press, people are struggling to keep up as it is. There's a hunger for progress, Detective. But also a fear. Today it would bury this company. That's why I've notified the authorities that we're going to end this -- tonight. (looks out at the city) The announcement of Heinrich's death at the hands of a robot wiped a billion dollars off our stock. So you tell me. If you were in my position, what would you do? \nHe looks back at Spooner and smiles.     That charismatic Robertson we saw before. \nROBERTSON Now. I believe this conversation is over. I don't want to see you near this building again, Detective. \nHe turns.   Calling over.   To the ESCORT ROBOTS... \nROBERTSON Get him out of here. \n101   EXT.

Out of his pocket. Looks down at it. Shaking his head. Passes a TRASH CAN. And drops it in. Continues on. Hands in his pockets. When... \nHe STOPS. Something.     Occurring to him.   Turns back to the trash can just as... \nA ROBOTIC CLEAN-UP CREW's about to up-end it into a bin... \nSPOONER No!... \nHe trots back. Plucking the drawing. Out of the can.       Turns it upside down.

Permeating the air. \nHe spreads the drawing out on the hood of the car.    Shining a FLASHLIGHT on it. Trying to get his bearings. \nThat HUM. Coming from nearby. On the other side.

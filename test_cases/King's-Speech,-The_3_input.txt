82   INT. AN OFFICE IN WESTMINSTER ABBEY - NIGHT                    82 
Lang is on the phone. The door is open. While talking he watches the work preparations. On the phone he tells someone: 
COSMO LANG I've made inquiries. 
83   INT. LOGUE DINING ROOM - NIGHT                                 83 
Logue enters and sits at the table. Myrtle serves him. 
MYRTLE A bit dry. Tried to keep it warm. 
LIONEL Mmm... Kedgeree! Lovely. 
MYRTLE You look done in. 
LIONEL I've news for you. You're coming to the Coronation. 
MYRTLE I've news for you. I'm not! 
LIONEL You must. 
MYRTLE Stand in the rain hoping for a glimpse? 
LIONEL Royal Box. You and I. 
Stunned silence, then. 
MYRTLE Lionel...I'd need a new dress. 
LIONEL Rather thought you might. 
Valentine calls from the next room: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                     98. 
VALENTINE (O.S.) Dad! Phone! For you! 
LIONEL Won't be a sec. 
He exits. Myrtle waits. Looks at herself, bemused, reflected in a glass-fronted cabinet. Even does a curtsey. 
84   INT.   WESTMINSTER ABBEY - THAT NIGHT                         84 
The last of the preparation crew are being scurried out by Lang. He gives a final, satisfied, look at the cavernous space, like a director preparing the stage for a final scene. He quotes Shakespeare, extremely pleased with himself: 
COSMO LANG "The play's the thing, wherein I'll catch the conscience of a King." 
He exits. 
THE CAMERA explores various elements: 
The Throne of Edward the Confessor. 
Beneath it, a large rough-hewn stone: The Stone Of Scone. 
Leaning against the Throne, a huge sword, set there for the next Coronation rehearsal. 
Majestic stained glass windows of saints, kings, and martyrs. 
Rows of pews, worn with centuries of use. 
Graves of the mighty: kings, poets, and statesmen. 
This Abbey holds the history of a nation. 
Footsteps resonate. 
Lionel enters.   Trips over one of the gravestones. 
LIONEL Bertie? Blast! Stepped on Lord Byron. Bertie...? 
Lights snap on skewering Lionel. Bertie steps into view wearing a coat against the night chill of the stone cathedral. 
BERTIE This is not a rehearsal, "Doctor" Logue. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   99. 
LIONEL Ah, the Star Chamber inquisition. I wondered when that would happen. And I'd promised Myrtle a new frock. 
BERTIE (barely controlled) "Just call me Lionel"! Never did you call yourself `Doctor'. We did that for you. No diploma, no training, no credentials. Just a great deal of nerve. 
LIONEL Want to hear my side of the story? 
BERTIE There isn't a "your-side-of-the-story". This is my story. And you've ruined it! Its not just the Coronation, terrifying enough, its the radio speech to millions afterwards, and the speech after that, and for the rest of my failed miserable life! 
LIONEL (softly) Wembley Stadium...

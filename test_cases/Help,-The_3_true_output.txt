SKEETER Aibileen? Aibileen becomes nervous at the sight of Skeeter alone. 
AIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. 
SKEETER I had hoped to ask you myself if you could help me with the "Miss Myrna" letters... 
AIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. 
SKEETER So...Would you help me? Aibileen nods and looks out to Elizabeth on the street. 
AIBILEEN Miss Myrna gets it wrong lotta times. Be good to get it right. 
SKEETER Thank you, Aibileen. I plan on splitting the pay with you, too. Aibileen doesn't respond. She grabs a basket of rolls. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) Listen...all that talk in there today. Hilly's talk I mean...I'm sorry you had to hear that. Aibileen quickly turns her back to Skeeter. A gospel choir begins singing on the radio. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) Is that Preacher Green's sermon on the radio? 
AIBILEEN Yes, ma'am, it is. 
SKEETER That reminds me so much of my maid growing up. Aibileen starts wiping down a serving tray. 
AIBILEEN Constantine and me...were in church circle together. 
Skeeter turns to Aibileen as she puts out her cigarette. 
SKEETER She loved me like you love Mae Mobley. 
AIBILEEN Yes, ma'am. Skeeter moves closer to Aibileen. 
SKEETER Aibileen? How could she just quit like that? Aibileen stops wiping and looks up to Skeeter... 
AIBILEEN Quit? 
SKEETER Yes. When I got home from school last week, Momma said she had quit. Back in March to go live with her people up in Chicago. She didn't leave me a note or anything. Aibileen turns and resumes wiping the tray. 
SKEETER (CONT'D) Could you do that to Mae Mobley? Aibileen slowly turns back to Skeeter. 
AIBILEEN No, ma'am. I couldn't... 
SKEETER Do you have an address for her or anything? Aibileen shrugs her shoulders, reeling it all back in. Just then, Elizabeth walks into the kitchen holding papers stapled together. She looks between Aibileen and Skeeter. 
ELIZABETH I'm sorry. Did I interrupt something? Skeeter and Aibileen shake their heads. Elizabeth hands Skeeter the papers. Home Help Sanitation Initiative is written on the cover. 
ELIZABETH (CONT'D) Hilly wants this put in the League newsletter. Skeeter nods. 
SKEETER Aibileen, I'll drop by at ten tomorrow to get started on Miss Myrna. Elizabeth looks at Aibileen. 
ELIZABETH Tomorrow is silver polishing day, so y'all make it quick, okay? 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - LATER THAT DAY 
Skeeter speeds down a country road lined with ancient oak trees in a white Cadillac. 
AIBILEEN (V.O.) I knew I had said too much to Miss Skeeter, but Constantine's story weren't mine to tell. Some things a girl shouldn't have to know about her own mother. Her frizzy hair swirls about as she passes a truck full of cotton. 
INT. CADILLAC (FANTASY SEQUENCE) - SAME TIME 
Skeeter looks ahead and sees an OLDER BLACK WOMAN walking with a LITTLE BLONDE GIRL, 6. They hold hands. The black woman smiles and waves as Skeeter passes. When Skeeter looks in her rear view mirror, they're gone. Skeeter suddenly stops the car just short of an intersecting gravel road. Skeeter slowly turns down the old road. 
EXT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - DAY 
Skeeter's car pulls into the overgrown yard of an old shack with a rusted-out tin roof. Two clapboard rooms are separated by an open breezeway. The front door is cracked opened. Skeeter gets out and walks toward Constantine's home. 
INT. CONSTANTINE'S HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Skeeter enters to find only a small bed, dresser, table, rocking chair and a wood burning stove. Past intruders have long since taken anything of value. 
As Skeeter approaches Constantine's bed, an OPOSSUM scurries out from underneath. Skeeter screams as the opossum runs out the door. Her eyes suddenly catch something. Lying on the bed is an OLD CORN PIPE. Skeeter picks it up and brings it to her face. Her eyes begin to well up. 
EXT. PHELAN PLANTATION - MOMENTS LATER 
Skeeter pulls in front of a grand antebellum home and parks to the side of her family's graveyard. Skeeter carries her black dress up the stairs of a covered porch. An old black man with white hair, JAMESO, 70, tightens a porch swing. 
SKEETER Hey, Jameso. 
JAMESO Hello, Miss Eugenia. 
INT. PHELAN PLANTATION - ENTRY FOYER - MOMENTS LATER 
Skeeter walks through the front door. 
SKEETER Momma! If the Smithsonian had wished to assemble the perfect antebellum home, Skeeter would be standing in it. 
INT. PHELAN HOME - PARENTS' BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER

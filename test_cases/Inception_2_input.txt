The liquid in Fischer's drink RISES UP AGAINST ONE SIDE OF THE GLASS- Fischer notices, confused. 
COBB Very odd-the weather, the gravity... 
Fischer looks around the bar- it's as if THE ENTIRE ROOM IS SET AT A 45-DEGREE ANGLE- glasses SLIDING off tables... 
COBB (CONT'D) But I can explain all this. You've actually been trained for this. (Fischer nods) Think of the strangeness of the weather, the shifts in gravity. None of this is real... (MORE) COBB (CONT'D) (beat) We're in a dream. 
Fischer looks at the room around them. Back to Cobb. All through the bar, patrons turn to look at Cobb IN UNISON. 
COBB (CONT'D) The simplest test of what I'm saying is for you to try and remember anything about the way you arrived in this hotel... okay? 
Fischer stares at Cobb, trying to process this. All around them, people STARE at Cobb. Several get up as if to approach. 
COBB (CONT'D) Breathe. Remember the training. Accept the fact that we're in a dream. That's why I'm here protecting you. 
As Fischer considers this we- 
CUT TO: 
INT./EXT. VAN ON RAINY STREETS - DAY 
Yusuf STRAIGHTENS UP the van, RACING down the street, swerving through traffic and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BAR - EVENING 
The building gradually EASES BACK INTO ALIGNMENT- 
FISCHER So you... you're not real? 
The bar patrons start to ignore Cobb again. 
COBB No. I'm a projection of your subconscious. I was put in place to protect you in the event that extractors pulled you into a dream. I believe that's what has happened. 
Fischer takes this in. Then looks at the Security Men approaching across the crooked floor, he nods at Cobb- 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY - EVENING 
Cobb escorts Fischer across the lobby. As he does so, he walks past the two CHILDREN, backs to us- Cobb ignores them- The two Sub-security fall in behind. Cobb hurries Fischer up the stairs- then PUSHES him into- 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Fischer stumbles in- turns to Cobb, angry- 
FISCHER Hey- 
Cobb reaches into his jacket- the First Man BURSTS in- Cobb KICKS him to the ground- DRAWS his gun as the SECOND MAN comes through the door, moving towards Fischer- 
BLAM! Cobb BLASTS the Second Man in the back- TURNS and SHOOTS the First Man. 
FISCHER (CONT'D) Jesus Christ! What are you doing?! 
Cobb turns to Fischer, calm. Convincing. 
COBB Look at the gun in his hand. 
Fischer looks: the Second Man was holding a pistol. Cobb opens the First Man's jacket to show Fischer his holster and sidearm. 
COBB (CONT'D) These men were sent to abduct you. 
Cobb pulls out the gun and HANDS it to Fischer. 
COBB (CONT'D) If I'm going to help you, I need you to be calm. 
Fischer remembers something. 
FISCHER If this is a dream, I have to kill myself and wake up- 
Fischer raises the gun towards his head- 
COBB I wouldn't do that-they've probably got you sedated. If you pull that trigger, you might not wake up, you might drop into a lower dream state. (MORE) COBB (CONT'D) Mr. Fischer, you know all this, you just have to remember it... 
Fischer lowers his gun. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
Saito walks down the corridor, followed by a Security Man. Saito DUCKS around the corner, moves to a GARBAGE CHUTE and DROPS Fischer's WALLET into it. He SLIPS into the stairwell as the Security Man comes abreast of the chute and pauses. 
INT. HOTEL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS 
Arthur leads Ariadne to a particular room: 491. 
INT. ROOM 491 - CONTINUOUS 
Arthur leads Ariadne in. He opens the closet, opens the room safe, pulls our FOUR BRICKS OF PLASTIC EXPLOSIVE. 
ARTHUR So, if everything's correct, this room should be directly below 528. 
INT. HOTEL LOBBY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb looks reassuringly at Fischer. 
COBB What do you remember from before this dream? 
FISCHER (thinking) Rain... gunfire... Uncle Peter. (looks up) Christ-we've been kidnapped. 
COBB Where were they holding you? 
FISCHER They had us... in the back of a van... 
COBB Your body's bouncing around in the back of a van right now-that explains the gravity shifts. 
FISCHER It was... to do with a safe... Christ, why's it so hard to remember? 
COBB It's like trying to remember a dream after you've woken up. It takes years of practice to do it easily. So, you and Browning have been pulled into this dream so they can steal something from your mind. What? 
FISCHER They wanted a combination to a safe... they demanded the first numbers to pop into my head. 
COBB That's them extracting a locator. 
FISCHER A locator? 
COBB A number from your own subconscious. It can be used any number of ways... (thinking) This is a hotel. Room numbers. What was the number you gave them? 
FISCHER 5, 2... something... it was a long number. 528... 528, 4 something. 
COBB (opens phone) Well, we know where to start. (into phone) Fifth floor.

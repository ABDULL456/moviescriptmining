Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a starving man exploring packages of food. He doesn't know where to turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling out books, touching them, smelling them. \nHe rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph player, industrial gray and green, the words \"Portland Public School District\" stenciled on the side. The box also contains stacks and stacks of used record albums. \nAndy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping through them. Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc. He comes across a certain album -- Mozart's \"Le Nozze de Figaro.\" He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man transfixed. It is a thing of beauty.

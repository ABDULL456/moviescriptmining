{"train": "ShawShank Redemption \nTHE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION \nby \nFrank Darabont \nBased upon the story Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption by Stephen King \n1\tINT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) \nA dark, empty room. \nThe door bursts open. A MAN and WOMAN enter, drunk and giggling, horny as hell. No sooner is the door shut than they're all over each other, ripping at clothes, pawing at flesh, mouths locked together. \nHe gropes for a lamp, tries to turn it on, knocks it over instead. Hell with it. He's got more urgent things to do, like getting her blouse open and his hands on her breasts. She arches, moaning, fumbling with his fly. He slams her against the wall, ripping her skirt. We hear fabric tear. \nHe enters her right then and there, roughly, up against the wall. She cries out, hitting her head against the wall but not caring, grinding against him, clawing his back, shivering with the sensations running through her. He carries her across the room with her legs wrapped around him. They fall onto the bed. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK, exiting through the window, traveling smoothly outside... \n2\tEXT -- CABIN -- NIGHT (1946) 2 \n...to reveal the bungalow, remote in a wooded area, the lovers' cries spilling into the night... \n...and we drift down a wooded path, the sounds of rutting passion growing fainter, mingling now with the night sounds of crickets and hoot owls... \n...and we begin to hear FAINT MUSIC in the woods, tinny and incongruous, and still we keep PULLING BACK until... \n...a car is revealed. A 1946 Plymouth. Parked in a clearing. \n3\tINT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 3 \nANDY DUFRESNE, mid-20's, wire rim glasses, three-piece suit. Under normal circumstances a respectable, solid citizen; hardly dangerous, perhaps even meek. But these circumstances are far from normal. He is disheveled, unshaven, and very drunk. A cigarette smolders in his mouth. His eyes, flinty and hard, are riveted to the bungalow up the path. \nHe can hear them fucking from here. \nHe raises a bottle of bourbon and knocks it back. The radio plays softly, painfully romantic, taunting him: \nYou stepped out of a dream... You are too wonderful... To be what you seem... \nHe opens the glove compartment, pulls out an object wrapped in a rag. He lays it in his lap and unwraps it carefully -- \n-- revealing a .38 revolver. Oily, black, evil. \nHe grabs a box of bullets. Spills them everywhere, all over the seats and floor. Clumsy. He picks bullets off his lap, loading them into the gun, one by one, methodical and grim. Six in the chamber. His gaze goes back to the bungalow. \nHe shuts off the radio. Abrupt silence, except for the distant lovers' moans. He takes another shot of bourbon courage, then opens the door and steps from the car. \n4\tEXT -- PLYMOUTH -- NIGHT (1946) 4 \nHis wingtip shoes crunch on gravel. Loose bullets scatter to the ground. The bourbon bottle drops and shatters. \nHe starts up the path, unsteady on his feet. The closer he gets, the louder the lovemaking becomes. Louder and more frenzied. The lovers are reaching a climax, their sounds of passion degenerating into rhythmic gasps and grunts. \nWOMAN (O.S.) Oh god...oh god...oh god... \nAndy lurches to a stop, listening. The woman cries out in orgasm. The sound slams into Andy's brain like an icepick. He shuts his eyes tightly, wishing the sound would stop. \nIt finally does, dying away like a siren until all that's left is the shallow gasping and panting of post-coitus. We hear languorous laughter, moans of satisfaction. \nWOMAN (O.S.) Oh god...that's sooo good...you're the best...the best I ever had... \nAndy just stands and listens, devastated. He doesn't look like much of a killer now; he's just a sad little man on a dirt path in the woods, tears streaming down his face, a loaded gun held loosely at his side. A pathetic figure, really. \nFADE TO BLACK: 1ST TITLE UP \n5\tINT -- COURTROOM -- DAY (1946) 5 \nTHE JURY listens like a gallery of mannequins on display, pale-faced and stupefied. \nD.A. (O.S.) Mr. Dufresne, describe the confrontation you had with your wife the night she was murdered. \nANDY DUFRESNE \nis on the witness stand, hands folded, suit and tie pressed, hair meticulously combed. He speaks in soft, measured tones: \nANDY It was very bitter. She said she was glad I knew, that she hated all the sneaking around. She said she wanted a divorce in Reno. \nD.A. What was your response? \nANDY I told her I would not grant one. \nD.A. (refers to his notes) I'll see you in Hell before I see you in Reno. Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne, according to the testimony of your neighbors. \nJUDGE You strike me as a particularly icy and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne. It chills my blood just to look at you. By the power vested in me by the State of Maine, I hereby order you to serve two life sentences, back to back, one for each of your victims. So be it. \nHe raps his gavel as we \nCRASH TO BLACK: LAST TITLE UP. \n9 \tAN IRON-BARRED DOOR 9 \nslides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room waits beyond. CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit side by side at a long table. An empty chair faces them. We are now in: \nINT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1947) \nRED enters, removes his cap and waits by the chair. \nMAN #1 Sit. \nRed sits, tries not to slouch. The chair is uncomfortable. \nMAN #2 We see by your file you've served twenty years of a life sentence. \nMAN #3 You feel you've been rehabilitated? \nRED Yes, sir. Absolutely. I've learned my lesson. I can honestly say I'm a changed man. I'm no longer a danger to society. That's the God's honest truth. No doubt about it. \nThe men just stare at him. One stifles a yawn. \nCLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM \nA big rubber stamp slams down: \"REJECTED\" in red ink. \n10\tEXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DUSK (1947) 10 \nHigh stone walls topped with snaky concertina wire, set off at intervals by looming guard towers. Over a hundred CONS are in the yard. Playing catch, shooting craps, jawing at each other, making deals. Exercise period. \nRED emerges into fading daylight, slouches low-key through the activity, worn cap on his head, exchanging hellos and doing minor business. He's an important man here. \nRED (V.O.) There's a con like me in every prison in America, I guess. I'm the guy who can get it for you. Cigarettes, a bag of reefer if you're partial, a bottle of brandy to celebrate your kid's high school graduation. Damn near anything, within reason. \nHe slips somebody a pack of smokes, smooth sleight-of-hand. \nRED (V.O.) Yes sir, I'm a regular Sears & Roebuck. \nTWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS issue from the main tower, drawing everybody's attention to the loading dock. The outer gate swings open...revealing a gray prison bus outside. \nRED (V.O.) So when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949 and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth into the prison for him, I told him no problem. And it wasn't. \nCON Fresh fish! Fresh fish today! \nRed is joined by HEYWOOD, SKEET, FLOYD, JIGGER, ERNIE, SNOOZE. Most cons crowd to the fence to gawk and jeer, but Red and his group mount the bleachers and settle in comfortably. \n11\tINT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1947) 11 \nAndy sits in back, wearing steel collar and chains. \nRED (V.O.) Andy came to Shawshank Prison in early 1947 for murdering his wife and the fella she was bangin'. \nThe bus lurches forward, RUMBLES through the gates. Andy gazes around, swallowed by prison walls. \nRED (V.O.) On the outside, he'd been vice- president of a large Portland bank. Good work for a man as young as he was, when you consider how conservative banks were back then. \nTOWER GUARD All clear! \nGUARDS approach the bus with carbines. The door jerks open. The new fish disembark, chained together single-file, blinking sourly at their surroundings. Andy stumbles against the MAN in front of him, almost drags him down. \nBYRON HADLEY, captain of the guard, slams his baton into Andy's back. Andy goes to his knees, gasping in pain. JEERS and SHOUTS from the spectators. \nHADLEY On your feet before I fuck you up so bad you never walk again. \n13 \tON THE BLEACHERS 13 \nRED There they are, boys. The Human Charm Bracelet. \nHEYWOOD Never seen such a sorry-lookin' heap of maggot shit in my life. \nJIGGER Comin' from you, Heywood, you being so pretty and all... \nFLOYD Takin' bets today, Red? \nRED (pulls notepad and pencil) Bear Catholic? Pope shit in the woods? Smokes or coin, bettor's choice. \nFLOYD Smokes. Put me down for two. \nRED High roller. Who's your horse? \nFLOYD That gangly sack of shit, third from the front. He'll be the first. \nRed listens to the CLANGING below. He watches Andy and a few others being brought up to the 2nd tier. \nRED (V.O.) Most new fish come close to madness the first night. Somebody always breaks down crying. Happens every time. The only question is, who's it gonna be? \nAndy is led past and given a cell at the end of the tier. \nRED (V.O.) It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess. I had my money on Andy Dufresne... \n18\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 18 \nThe bars slam home. Andy is alone in his cell, clutching his clothes. He gazes around at his new surroundings, taking it in. He slowly begins to dress himself... \n19\tEXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- NIGHT (1947) 19 \nA malignant stone growth on the Maine landscape. The moon hangs low and baleful in a dead sky. The headlight of a PASSING TRAIN cuts through the night. \n20\tINT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 20 \nRed lies on his bunk below us, tossing his baseball toward the ceiling and catching it again. He pauses, listening. FOOTSTEPS approach below, unhurried, echoing hollowly on stone. \n21\tINT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1947) 21 \nLOW ANGLE. A CELLBLOCK GUARD strolls into frame. \nGUARD That's lights out! Good night, ladies. \nThe lights bump off in sequence. The guard exits, footsteps echoing away. Darkness now. Silence. CAMERA CRANES UP the tiers toward Red's cell. \nRED (V.O.) I remember my first night. Seems a long time ago now. \nRed looms from the darkness, leans on the bars. Listens. Waits. From somewhere below comes faint, ghastly tittering. VOICES drift through the cellblock, taunting: \nVARIOUS VOICES (O.S.) Fishee fishee fisheeee...You're gonna like it here, new fish. A whooole lot...Make you wish your daddies never dicked your mommies...You takin' this down, new fish? Gonna be a quiz later. (somebody LAUGHS) Sshhh. Keep it down. The screws'll hear...Fishee fishee fisheeee... \nRED (V.O.) The boys always go fishin' with first-timers...and they don't quit till they reel someone in. \nThe VOICES keep on, sly and creepy in the dark... \n22\tINT -- VARIOUS CELLS -- NIGHT (1947) 22 thru thru 25 2g ...while the new cons go quietly crazy in their cells. One man paces like a caged animal...another sits gnawing his cuticles bloody...a third is weeping silently...a fourth is dry-heaving into the toilet... \n26\tINT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 26 \nRed waits at the bars. Smoking. Listening. He cranes his head, peers down toward Andy's cell. Nothing. Not a peep. \nHEYWOOD (O.S.) Fat-Ass...oh, Faaaat-Ass. Talk to me, boy. I know you're in there. I can hear you breathin'. Now don't you listen to these nitwits, hear? \n27\tINT -- FAT-ASS' CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 27 \nFat-Ass is crying, trying not to hyperventilate. \nHEYWOOD (O.S.) This ain't such a bad place. I'll introduce you around, make you feel right at home. I know some big ol' bull queers who'd love to make your acquaintance...especially that big white mushy butt of yours... \nAnd that's it. Fat-Ass lets out a LOUD WAIL of despair: \nFAT-ASS OH GOD! I DON'T BELONG HERE! I WANNA GO HOME! \n28\tINT -- HEYWOOD'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 28 \nHEYWOOD AND IT'S FAT-ASS BY A NOSE.' \n29\tINT -- CELLBLOCK -- NIGHT (1947) 29 \nThe place goes nuts. Fat-Ass throws himself screaming against the bars. The entire block starts CHANTING: \nVOICES Fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh fish...fresh fish... \nFAT-ASS I WANNA GO HOME! I WANT MY MOTHER.' \nVOICE (O.S.) I had your mother! She wasn't that great! \nThe lights bump on. GUARDS pour in, led by Hadley himself. \nHADLEY What the Christ is this happy shit? \nVOICE (O.S.) He took the Lord's name in vain! I'm tellin' the warden! \nHADLEY (to the unseen wit) You'll be tellin' him with my baton up your ass! \nHadley arrives at Fat-Ass' cell, bellowing through the bars: \nHADLEY What's your malfunction you fat fuckin' barrel of monkey-spunk? \nFAT-ASS PLEASE! THIS AIN'T RIGHT! I AIN'T SUPPOSED TO BE HERE! NOT ME! \nHADLEY I ain't gonna count to three! Not even to one! Now shut the fuck up 'fore I sing you a lullabye! \nBrooks nods, never missing a beat. He rolls his cart to Andy's cell, mutters through the bars: \nBROOKS Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel. \nAndy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object disappear. The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of folded paper along with more cigarettes. Brooks turns his cart around and goes back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough for Red to snag the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket. \n44\tINT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 44 \nRed unfolds the slip of paper. Penciled neatly on it is a single word: \"Thanks.\" \n45\tINT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 45 \nWe are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line. Andy is doing his job, getting good at it. \nBOB DUFRESNE! WE'RE LOW ON HEXLITE! HEAD ON BACK AND FETCH US UP SOME! \nAndy nods. He leaves the line, weaving his way through the laundry room and into -- \n46\tINT -- BACK ROOMS/STOCK AREA -- DAY (1947) 46 \n-- a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. Andy hefts a cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack, turns around -- \n-- and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle. blocking his way. Rooster looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness on the left. A frozen beat. Andy slams the Hexlite to the floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful. \nANDY You get this in your eyes, it blinds you. \nBOGS Honey, hush. \nAndy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through the maze. The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. That's all it takes. They're on him in an instant, kicking and stomping. \nAndy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from behind. They propel him across the room and slam him against an old four-pocket machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams a rag into Andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like a horse bit. Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete have his arms firmly pinned. Bogs whispers in Andy's ear: \nBOGS That's it, fight. Better that way. \nAndy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. CAMERA PULLS BACK, SLOWLY WIDENING. The big Washex blocks our view. All we see is Andy's screaming face and the men holding him down... \n...and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM, leaving the dark place and the dingy act behind...MOVING up empty corridors, past concrete walls and steel pipes... \nRED (V.O.) I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world. \nWE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard, WIDENING for a final view of the line. The giant steel \"mangler\" is slapping down in brutal rhythm. The sound is deafening. \nRED (V.O.) He never said who did it...but we all knew. \nPRISON MONTAGE: (1947 through 1949) \n47 \tANDY PLODS THROUGH HIS DAYS. WORKING. EATING. CHIPPING AND 47 shaping his rocks after lights-out... \nRED (V.O.) Things went on like that for a while. Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine. \n48 \tANDY WALKS THE YARD, FACE SWOLLEN AND BRUISED. 48 \nRED (V.O.) Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises. \n49 \tANDY EATS BREAKFAST. A FEW TABLES OVER, BOGS BLOWS HIM A KISS. 49 \nRED (V.O.) The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes he was able to fight them off... sometimes not. \n50 \tANDY BACKS INTO A CORNER IN SOME DINGY PART OF THE PRISON, wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors. \nRED (V.O.) He always fought, that's what I remember. He fought because he knew if he didn't fight, it would make it that much easier not to fight the next time. \nThe rake connects, snapping off over somebody's skull. They beat the hell out of him. \nRED (V.O.) Half the time it landed him in the infirmary... \n51\tINT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT (\"THE HOLE\") -- NIGHT (1949) 51 \nA stone closet. No bed, sink, or lights. Just a toilet with no seat. Andy sits on bare concrete, bruised face lit by a faint ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door. \nRED (V.O.) ...the other half, it landed him in solitary. Warden Norton's \"grain & drain\" vacation. Bread, water, and all the privacy you could want. \n52\tINT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1949) 52 \nAndy is working the line. \nRED (V.O.) And that's how it went for Andy. That was his routine. I do believe those first two years were the worst for him. And I also believe if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him. But then, in the spring of 1949, the powers-that-be decided that... \n53\tEXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 53 \nWarden Norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn: \nNORTON ...the roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing. I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work. We're gonna be taking names in this steel bucket here... \nRed glances around at his friends. Andy also catches his eye. \nHEYWOOD Oh God, he's gonna do it, he's gonna throw him off the roof... \nSNOOZE Oh shit, oh fuck, oh Jesus... \nANDY Because if you do trust her, there's no reason in the world you can't keep every cent of that money. \nHadley abruptly jerks Andy to a stop right at the edge. In fact, Andy's past the edge, beyond his balance, shoetips scraping the roof. The only thing between him and an ugly drop to the concrete is Hadley's grip on the front of his shirt. \nHADLEY You better start making sense. \nANDY If you want to keep that money, all of it, just give it to your wife. See, the IRS allows you a one-time- only gift to your spouse. It's good up to sixty thousand dollars. \nHADLEY Naw, that ain't right! Tax free? \nANDY Tax free. IRS can't touch one cent. \nThe cons are pausing work, stunned by this business discussion. \nHADLEY You're the smart banker what shot his wife. Why should I believe a smart banker like you? So's I can wind up in here with you? \nANDY It's perfectly legal. Go ask the IRS, they'll say the same thing. Actually, I feel silly telling you all this. I'm sure you would have investigated the matter yourself. \nHADLEY Fuckin'-A. I don't need no smart wife-killin' banker to show me where the bear shit in the buckwheat. \nANDY Of course not. But you will need somebody to set up the tax-free gift, and that'll cost you. A lawyer, for example... \nHADLEY Ambulance-chaaing, highway-robbing cocksuckers! \nANDY ...or come to think of it, I suppose I could set it up for you. That would save you some money. I'll write down the forms you need, you can pick them up, and I'll prepare them for your signature... nearly free of charge. (off Hadley's look) I'd only ask three beers apiece for my co-workers, if that seems fair. \nTROUT (guffawing) Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it? Co-workers... \nHadley freezes him with a look. Andy presses on: \nANDY I think a nan working outdoors feels more like a man if he can have a bottle of suds. That's only my opinion. \nThe convicts stand gaping, all pretense of work gone. They look like they've been pole-axed. Hadley shoots them a look. \nHADLEY What are you jimmies starin' at? Back to work, goddamn it! \n59\tEXT -- LICENSE PLATE FACTORY -- DAY (1949) 59 \nAs before, an object is hauled up the side of the building by rope -- only this time, it's a cooler of beer and ice. \nRED (V.O.) And that's how it came to pass, that on the second-to-last day of the job, the convict crew that tarred the plate factory roof in the spring of '49... \n60\tEXT -- ROOF -- SHORTLY LATER (1949) 60 \nThe cons are taking the sun and drinking beer. \nRED (V.O.) ...wound up sitting in a row at ten o'clock in the morning, drinking icy cold Black Label beer courtesy of the hardest screw that ever walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison. \nHADLEY Drink up, boys. While it's cold. \nRED (V.O.) The colossal prick even managed to sound magnanimous. \nRed knocks back another sip, enjoying the bitter cold on his tongue and the warm sun on face. \nRED (V.O.) We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders, and felt like free men. We could'a been tarring the \nroof of one of our own houses. We were the Lords of all Creation. \nHe glances over to Andy squatting apart from the others. \nRED (V.O.) As for Andy, he spent that break hunkered in the shade, a strange little smile on his face, watching us drink his beer. \nHEYWOOD (approaches with a beer) Here's a cold one, Andy. \nANDY No thanks. I gave up drinking. \nHeywood drifts back to others, giving them a look. \nRED (V.O.) You could argue he'd done it to curry favor with the guards. Or maybe make a few friends among us cons. Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again...if only for a short while. \n61\tEXT -- PRISON YARD -- THE BLEACHERS -- DAY (1949) 61 \nAndy and Red play checkers. Red makes his move. \nRED King me. \nANDY Chess. Now there's a game of kings. Civilized...strategic... \nRED ...and totally fuckin' inexplicable. Hate that game. \nANDY Maybe you'll let me teach you someday. I've been thinking of getting a board together. \nANDY Rita Hayworth. Can you get her? \nRED No problem. Take a few weeks. \nANDY Weeks? \nRED Don't have her stuffed down my pants this very moment, sorry to say. Relax. What are you so nervous about? She's just a woman. \nAndy nods, embarrassed. He gets up and hurries out. Red grins, turns back to the movie. \n65\tINT -- AUDITORIUM CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1949) 65 \nAndy exits the theater and freezes in his tracks. Two dark figures loom in the corridor, blocking his path. Rooster and Pete. Andy turns back -- and runs right into Bogs. Instant bear hug. The Sisters are on him like a flash. They kick a door open and drag him into -- \n66 \tTHE PROJECTION BOOTH 66 \n-- where they confront the startled PROJECTIONIST, an old con blinking at them through thick bifocals. \nBOGS Take a walk. \nPROJECTIONIST I have to change reels. \nBOGS I said fuck off. \nTerrified, the old man darts past and out the door. Pete slams and locks it. Bogs shoves Andy to the center of the room. \nBOGS Ain't you gonna scream? \nAndy sighs, cocks his head at the projector. \nANDY They'd never hear me over that. Let's get this over with. \nSeemingly resigned, Andy turns around, leans on the rewind bench -- and curls his fingers around a full 1.000 foot reel of 35mm film. Rooster licks his lips, pushes past the others. \nROOSTER Me first. \nANDY Okay. \nAndy whips the reel of film around in a vicious arc, smashing it into Rooster's face and bouncing him off the wall. \nROOSTER Fuck! Shit! He broke my nose! \nAndy fights like hell, but is soon overpowered and forced to his knees. Bogs steps to Andy, pulls out an awl with a vicious eight-inch spike, gives him a good long look at it. \nBOGS Now I'm gonna open my fly, and you're gonna swallow what I give you to swallow. And when you d mine, you gonna swallow Rooster's. You done broke his nose, so he ought to have somethin' to show for it. \nANDY Anything you put in my mouth, you're going to lose. \nBOGS You don't understand. You do that, I'll put all eight inches of this steel ii your ear. \nANDY Okay. But you should know that sudden serious brain injury causes the victim to bite down. Hard. (faint smile) In fact, I understand the bite-reflex is so strong the victim's jaws have to be pried open with a crowbar. \nThe Sisters consider this carefully. The film runs out of the projector, flapping on the reel. The screen goes white. \nBOGS You little fuck. \nAndy gets a bootheel in the face. The Sisters start kicking and beating the living shit out of him with anything they can get their hands on. In the theater, the convicts are CHANTING AND CLAPPING for the movie to come back on. \nRED (V.O.) Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth, and neither did his friends. What they did do is beat him within an inch of his life... \n67\tINT -- INFIRMARY -- DAY (1949) 67 \nAndy lies wrapped in bandages. \nRED (V.O.) Andy spent a month in traction. \n68\tINT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT -- DAY (1949) 68 \nRED (V.O.) Bogs spent a week in the hole. \nBogs sits on bare concrete. The steel door slides open. \nGUARD Time's up, Bogs. \n69\tINT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 3RD TIER -- DUSK (1949) 69 \nBogs comes up the stairs, smoking a cigarette. Not many cons around; the place is virtually deserted. A VOICE echoes dimly over the P.A. system: \nVOICE (O.S.) Return to your cellblocks for evening count. \nBogs enters his cell. Dark in here. He fumbles for the light cord, yanks it. The sudden light reveals Captain Hadley six inches from his face, waiting for him. Mert steps in behind Bogs. hemming him. \nBefore Bogs can even open his mouth to say \"what the fuck,\" Hadley rams the tip of his baton brutally into his solar plexus. Bogs doubles over, gagging his wind out. \n70 \tGROUND FLOOR 70 \n81\tINT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1949) 81 \nAndy, limping a bit, returns from the infirmary. Red watches from his cell as Andy is brought up and locked away. \n82\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 82 \nAndy finds the cardboard tube lying on his bunk. \nGUARD (O.S.) Lights out! \nThe lights go off. Andy opens the tube and pulls out a large rolled poster. He lets it uncurl to the floor. A small scrap of paper flutters out, landing at his feet. The poster is the famous Rita Hayworth pin-up -- one hand behind her head, eyes half closed, sulky lips parted. Andy picks up the scrap of paper. It reads: \"No charge. Welcome back.\" Alone in the dark, Andy smiles. \n83\tINT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- MORNING (1949) 83 \nThe BUZZER SOUNDS, the cells SLAM OPEN. Cons step from their cells. Andy catches Red's eye, nods his thanks. As the men shuffle down to breakfast, Red glances into Andy's cell -- \n84 \tRED'S POV -- DOLLYING PAST 84 \n-- and sees Rita in her new place of honor on Andy's wall. Sunlight casts a harsh barred shadow across her lovely face. \n85\tINT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1949) 85 \nErnie is mopping the floor. He glances back and sees Warden Norton approach the cellblock with an entourage of a DOZEN GUARDS. Still mopping, Ernie mutters to the nearest cell: \nERNIE Heads up. They're tossin' cells. \nWord travels fast from cell to cell. Cons scramble to tidy up and hide things. Norton enters, nods to his men. The guards pair off in all directions, making their choices at random. \nGUARD What kind'a contraband you hiding in there, boy? \nCells are opened, occupants displaced, items scattered, mattresses overturned. Whatever contraband is found gets tossed out onto the cellblock floor. Mostly harmless stuff. \nA GUARD pulls a sharpened screwdriver out of a mattress, shoots a nasty look at the CON responsible. \nNORTON Solitary. A week. Make sure he takes his Bible. \nCON Too goddamn dark to read down there. \nNORTON Add another week for blasphemy. \nThe man is taken away. Norton's gaze goes up. \nNORTON Let's try the second tier. \n86 \t2ND TIER 86 \nNorton arrives, makes a thin show of picking a cell at random. He motions at Andy on his bunk, reading his Bible. The door is unlocked. Norton enters, trailed by his men. Andy rises. \nANDY Good evening. \nNorton gives a curt nod. Hadley and Trout start tossing the cell in a thorough search. Norton keeps his eyes on Andy, looking for a wrong glance or nervous blink. He takes the Bible out of Andy's hand. \nNORTON I'm pleased to see you reading this. Any favorite passages? \nANDY Watch ye therefore, for ye know not when the master of the house cometh. \nNORTON (smiles) Luke. Chapter 13, verse 35. I've always liked that one. (strolls the cell) But I prefer: \"I am the light of the world. He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.\" \nANDY John. Chapter 8, verse 12. \nNORTON I hear you're good with numbers. How nice. A man should have a skill. \nHADLEY You wanna explain this? \nAndy glances over. Hadley is holding up a rock blanket, a polishing cloth roughly the size of an oven mitt. \nANDY It's called a rock blanket. It's for shaping and polishing rocks. Little hobby of mine. \nHadley glances at the rocks lining the window sill, turns to Norton. \nHADLEY Looks pretty clean. Some contraband here, nothing to get in a twist over. \nNorton nods, strolls to the poster of Rita. \nNORTON I can't say I approve of this... (turns to Andy) ...but I suppose exceptions can always be made. \nNorton exits, the guards follow. The cell door is slammed and locked. Norton pauses, turns back. \nNORTON I almost forgot. \nHe reaches through the bars and returns the Bible to Andy. \nNORTON I'd hate to deprive you of this. Salvation lies within. \nNorton and his men walk away. \nFLOYD He didn't say that! \nBROOKS God is my witness. And Dekins, he just blinks for a second, then laughs his ass off. Afterward, he actually shook Andy's hand. \nHEYWOOD My ass! \nBROOKS Shook his fuckin' hand. Just about shit myself. All Andy needed was a suit and tie, a jiggly little hula girl on his desk, he would'a been Mister Dufresne, if you please. \nRED Makin' yourself some friends, Andy. \nANDY I wouldn't say \"friends.\" I'm a convicted murderer who provides sound financial planning. That's a wonderful pet to have. \nRED Got you out of the laundry, didn't it? \nANDY Maybe it can do more than that. (off their looks) How about expanding the library? Get some new books in there. \nHEYWOOD How you 'spect to do that, \"Mr. Dufresne-if-you-please?\" \nANDY Ask the warden for funds. \nLAUGHTER all around. Andy blinks at them. \nBROOKS Son, I've had six wardens through here during my tenure, and I have learned one great immutable truth of the universe: ain't one of 'em been born whose asshole don't pucker up tight as a snare drum when you ask for funds. \n93\tINT -- MAIN BUILDING HALLWAY -- DAY (1949) 93 \nDOLLYING Norton and Andy up the hall: \nNORTON Not a dime. My budget's stretched thin as it is. \nANDY I see. Perhaps I could write to the State Senate and request funds directly from them. \nNORTON Far as them Republican boys in Augusta are concerned, there's only three ways to spend the taxpayer's hard-earned when it come to prisons. More walls. More bars. More guards. \nANDY Still, I'd like to try, with your permission. I'll send a letter a week. They can't ignore me forever. \nNORTON They sure can, but you write your letters if it makes you happy. I'll even mail 'em for you, how's that? \n94\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1949) 94 \nAndy is on his bunk, writing a letter. \nRED (V.O.) So Andy started writing a letter a week, just like he said. \n95\tINT -- GUARD DESK/NORTON'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1949) 95 \nAndy pops his head in. The GUARD shakes his head. \nRED (V.O.) And just like Norton said, Andy got no answers. But still he kept on. \n96\tINT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1950) 96 \nAndy is doing taxes. Mert Entwhistle is seated across from him. Other off-duty guards are waiting their turn. \nRED (V.O.) The following April, Andy did tax returns for half the guards at Shawshank. \n97\tINT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- ONE YEAR LATER (1951) 97 \nTax time again. Even more guards are waiting. \nRED (V.O.) Year after that, he did them all... including the warden's. \n98\tEXT -- BASEBALL DIAMOND -- DAY (1952) 98 \nA BATTER in a \"Noresby Marauders\" baseball uniform WHACKS the ball high into left field and races for first. \nRED (V.O.) Year after that, they rescheduled the start of the intramural season to coincide with tax season... \n99\tINT -- PRISON LIBRARY/ANDY'S OFFICE -- DAY (1952) 99 \nThe Batter sits across from Andy. The line winds out the door. \nRED (V.O.) The guards on the opposing teams all remembered to bring their W-2's. \nANDY Moresby Prison issued you that gun, but you actually had to pay for it? \nTHE BATTER Damn right, and the holster too. \nANDY See, that's all deductible. You get to write that off. \nRED (V.O.) Yes sir, Andy was a regular H&R Block. In fact, he got so busy at tax time, he was allowed a staff. \nANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Red and Brooks doing filing chores. \nANDY Say Red, could you hand me a stack of those 1040s? \nRED Believe what you want. These walls are funny. First you hate 'em, then you get used to 'em. After long enough, you get so you depend on 'em. That's \"institutionalized.\" \nJIGGER Shit. I could never get that way. \nERNIE (softly) Say that when you been inside as long as Brooks has. \nRED Goddamn right. They send you here for life, and that's just what they take. Part that counts, anyway. \n105\tEXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- DAWN (1954) 105 \nThe sun rises over gray stone. \n106\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAWN (1954) 106 \nANGLE ON RITA POSTER. Sexy as ever. The rising sun sends fingers of rosy light creeping across her face. \n107\tINT -- LIBRARY -- DAWN (1954) 107 \nBrooks stands on a chair, poised at the bars of a window, cradling Jake in his hands. \nBROOKS I can't take care of you no more. You go on now. You're free. \nHe tosses Jake through the bars. The crow flaps away. \n108\tEXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON -- MAIN GATE -- DAY (1954) 108 \nTWO SHORT SIREN BLASTS herald the opening of the gate. It swings hugely open, revealing Brooks standing in his cheap suit, carrying a cheap bag, wearing a cheap hat. \nBrooks walks out, tears streaming down his face. He looks back. Red, Andy, and others stand at the inner fence, seeing him off. The massive gate closes, wiping them from view. \n109\tINT -- BUS -- DAY (1954) 109 \nBrooks is riding the bus, clutching the seat before him, gripped by terror of speed and motion. \nBROOKS (V.O.) Dear Fellas. I can't believe how fast things move on the outside. \n110\tEXT -- STREET -- PORTLAND, MAINE -- DAY (1954) 110 \nBrooks looks like a kid trying to cross the street without his parents. People and traffic a blur. \nBROOKS (V.O.) I saw an automobile once when I was young. Now they're everywhere. \n111\tEXT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- DAY (1954) 111 \nBrooks comes trudging up the sidewalk. He glances up as a prop-driven airliner streaks in low overhead. \nBROOKS (V.O.) The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry. \nHe arrives at the Brewster. It ain't much to look at. \n112\tINT -- BREWSTER HOTEL -- DAY (1954) 112 \nA WOMAN leads Brooks up the stairs toward the top floor. He has trouble climbing so many stairs. \nWOMAN No music in your room after eight p.m. No guests after nine. No cooking except on the hotplate... \nBROOKS (V.O.) People even talk faster. And louder. \n113\tINT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- DAY (1954) 113 \nBrooks enters. The room is small, old, dingy. Heavy wooden beams cross the ceiling. An arched window affords a view of Congress Street. Traffic noise drifts in. Brooks sets his bag down. He doesn't quite know what to do. He just stands there, like a man waiting for a bus. \nBROOKS (V.O.) The parole board got me into this halfway house called the Brewster, and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway... \n114\tINT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY (1954) 114 \nLoud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. Brooks is bagging groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. \nWOMAN Make sure he double-bags. Last time your man didn't double-bag and the bottom near came out. \nMANAGER You double-bag like the lady says, understand? \nBROOKS Yes sir, double-bag, surely will. \nBROOKS (V.O.) It's hard work. I try to keep up, but my hands hurt most of the time. I don't think the store manager likes me very much. \n115\tEXT -- PARK -- DAY (1954) 115 \nBrooks sits alone on a bench, feeding pigeons. \nBROOKS (V.O.) Sometimes after work I go to the park and feed the birds. I keep thinking Jake might show up and say hello, but he never does. I hope wherever he is, he's doing okay and making new friends. \n116\tINT -- BROOKS' ROOM -- NIGHT (1954) 116 \nDark. Traffic outside. Brooks wakes up. Disoriented. Afraid. Somewhere in the night, a LOUD ARGUMENT is taking place. \ntable. An empty chair faces them. We are again in: \nINT -- SHAWSHANK HEARINGS ROOM -- DAY (1957) \nRed enters, ten years older than when we first saw him at a parole hearing. He removes his cap and sits. \nMAN #l It says here you've served thirty years of a life sentence. \nMAN #2 You feel you've been rehabilitated? \nRED Yes sir, without a doubt. I can say I'm a changed man. No danger to society, that's the God's honest truth. Absolutely rehabilitated. \nCLOSEUP -- PAROLE FORM \nA big rubber stamp slams down: \"REJECTED.\" \n152\tEXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1957) 152 \nRed emerges into fading daylight. Andy's waiting for him. \nRED Same old, same old. Thirty years. Jesus. When you say it like that... \nANDY You wonder where it went. I wonder where ten years went. \nRed nods, solemn. They settle in on the bleachers. Andy pulls a small box from his sweater, hands it to Red. \nANDY Anniversary gift. Open it. \nRed does. Inside the box, on a thin layer of cotton, is a shiny new harmonica, bright aluminum and circus-red. \nANDY Had to go through one of your competitors. Hope you don't mind. Wanted it to be a surprise. \nRED It's very pretty, Andy. Thank you. \nANDY You gonna play something? \nRed considers it, shakes his head. Softly: \nRED Not today. \n153\tINT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE/ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1957) 153 \nMen line the tiers as the evening count is completed. The convicts step into their cells. The master switch is thrown and all the doors slam shut -- KA-THUMP! Andy finds a cardboard tube on his bunk. The note reads: \"A new girl for your 10 year anniversary. From your pal. Red.\" \n154\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- LATER (1957) 154 \nMarilyn Monroe's face fills the screen. SLOW PULL BACK reveals the new poster: the famous shot from \"The Seven Year Itch,\" on the subway grate with skirt billowing up. Andy sits gazing at her as lights-out commences... \n155\tINT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1957) 155 \n...and we find Red gazing blankly as darkness takes the cellblock. Adding up the months, weeks, days... \nHe regards the harmonica like a man confronted with a Martian artifact. He considers trying it out -- even holds it briefly to his lips, almost embarrassed -- but puts it back in its box untested. And there the harmonica will stay... \nFADE TO BLACK \n156 \tWE HOLD IN BLACKNESS as THUMPING SOUNDS grow louder... 156 \nRED (V.O.) Andy was as good as his word. He kept writing to the State Senate. Two letters a week instead of one. \n...and the BLACKNESS disintegrates as a wall tumbles before our eyes, revealing a WORK CREW with picks and sledgehammers, faces obscured outlaw-style with kerchiefs against the dust. Behind them are GUARDS overseeing the work. \nAndy yanks his kerchief down, grinning in exhilaration. Red and the others follow suit. They step through the hole in the wall, exploring what used to be a sealed-off storage room. \nRED (V.O.) In 1959, the folks up Augusta way finally clued in to the fact they couldn't buy him off with just a 200 dollar check. Appropriations Committee voted an annual payment of 500 dollars, just to shut him up. \n157\tINT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 157 \nTRACKING the construction. Walls have been knocked down. Men are painting, plastering, hammering. Lots of shelves going up. Red is head carpenter. We find him discussing plans with Andy. \nRED (V.O.) Those checks came once a year like clockwork. \n158\tINT -- PRISON LIBRARY -- DAY (1960) 158 \nRed and the boys are opening boxes, pulling out books. \nRED (V.O.) You'd be amazed how far Andy could stretch it. He made deals with book clubs, charity groups...he bought remaindered books by the pound... \nHEYWOOD Treasure Island. Robert Louis... \nANDY (jotting) ...Stevenson. Next? \nRED I got here an auto repair manual, and a book on soap carving. \nANDY Trade skills and hobbies, those go under educational. Stack right behind you. \nANDY I don't waste time on losers, Tommy. \nTOMNY (tight) I ain't no goddamn loser. \nANDY That's a good start. If we do this, we do it all the way. One hundred percent. Nothing half-assed. \nTommy thinks about it, nods. \nTOMMY Thing is, see... (leans in, mutters) ...I don't read all that good. \nANDY (smiles) Well. You've come to the right place then. \n179\tINT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 179 \nWe find Andy giving an impassioned reading: \nANDY ...and the lamplight o'er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor...and my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor, shall be lifted nevermore! \" \nAndy slaps the book shut, immensely pleased with himself. \nTOMMY So this raven just sits there and won't go away? \nANDY That's right. \nTOMMY (beat) Why don't that fella get hisself a 12-gauge and dust the fucker? \n180\tINT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 180 \nTommy tries to read as Andy looks on: \nTOMMY The cat sh--The cat shh... (glances up) The cat shat on the welcome mat? \nAndy shakes his head. Not exactly. \n181\tINT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 181 \nAndy chalks the alphabet on a blackboard. \nRED (V.O.) So Andy took Tommy under his wing. Started walking him through his ABCs... \n182\tINT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1965) 182 \nTRACK the table to Tommy and Andy. Discussing a book. \nRED (V.O.) Tommy took to it pretty well, too. Boy found brains he never knew he had. \n183\tEXT -- EXERCISE YARD BLEACHERS -- DAY (1965) 183 \nTOMNY The cat sh--shh--shimmied up the tree and crept st--stel--stealthily out on the limb... \n184\tINT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1965) 184 \nTommy intent on a paperback, mouthing the words. Behind him, wood is piling up on the conveyor belt. \nRED (V.O.) After a while, you couldn't pry those books out of hands. \nRED Ass in gear, son! You're putting us behind! \nTommy shoves the book in his back pocket and hurries over. \n185\tINT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 185 \nTommy writes a sentence on the blackboard. Andy steps in, shows him how to reconstruct it. \nRED (V.O.) Before long, Andy started him on his course requirements. He really liked the kid, that was part of it. Gave him a thrill to help a youngster crawl off the shitheap. But that wasn't the only reason... \n186\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 186 \nTIGHT ANGLE on chessboard. Most of the pieces complete. PAN TO Andy lying in his bunk, carefully polishing... \nRED (V.O.) Prison time is slow time. Sometimes it feels like stop-time. So you do what you can to keep going... \n...and we keep going past Andy in a SLOW PAN of the cell. Sink. Toilet. Books. Outside the window bars, we hear another TRAIN passing in the night... \nRED (V.O.) Some fellas collect stamps. Others build matchstick houses. Andy built a library. Now he needed a new project. Tommy was it. It was the same reason he spent years shaping and polishing those rocks. The same reason he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall... \n...STILL PANNING, past a chair, a sweater on a hook...and finally to the place of honor on the wall... \nRED (V.O.) In prison, a man'll do most anything to keep his mind occupied. \n...where the latest poster turns out to be Racquel Welch ins fur bikini. Gorgeous. \"One Million Years, B. C. \" SLOW PUSH IN, \nRED (V.O.) By 1966...right about the time Tommy was getting ready to take his exams...it was lovely Racquel. \n187\tINT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 187 \nNORTON (rises) Dufresne, if you want to indulge this fantasy, that's your business. Don't make it mine. This meeting's over. \nANDY Look, if it's the squeeze, don't worry. I'd never say what goes on in here. I'd be just as indictable as you for laundering the money! \nNORTON Don't you ever mention money to me again, you sorry son of a bitch! Not in this office, not anywhere! (slaps intercom) Get in here! Now! \nANDY I was just trying to rest your mind at ease, that's all. \nNORTON (as GUARDS enter) Solitary! A month! \nAndy gets dragged away, kicking and screaming: \nANDY What's the matter with you? It's my chance to get out, don't you see that? It's my life! Don't you understand it's my life? \n193\tEXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 193 \nMail call. Men crowd around as names are called out. Red and the boys are parked on the bleachers. \nFLOYD A month in the hole. Longest damn stretch I ever heard of. \nTOMMY It's my fault. \nRED Like hell. You didn't pull the trigger, and you didn't convict him. \nHEYWOOD Red? You saying Andy's innocent? I mean for real innocent? (Red nods) Sweet Jesus. How long's he been in here? \nRED Since '47. Going on nineteen years. \nMAIL CALLER Thomas Williams! \nTommy raises his hand. The envelope gets tossed to him. He stares at it. Red peers over his shoulder. \nRED Board of Education. \nTOMMY The son of a bitch mailed it. \nRED Looks that way. You gonna open it or stick your thumb up your butt? \nTOMMY Thumb up my butt sounds better. \nHe gets hemmed in by the older men. Red snatches the letter. \nTOMMY C'mon, just throw it away. Will you please? Just throw it away? \nRed rips it open, scans the letter. Expressionless. \nRED Well, shit. \n194\tINT -- VISITOR'S ROOM -- DAY (1966) 194 \nTommy makes his way through the chaos, finds Beth and the baby waiting behind the thick plexi shield. He sits, doesn't pick up the phone. Just stares at Beth. She doesn't know what to make of it. \nHe presses a piece of paper against the glass. A high school diploma. Her face lights up, blinking back tears. \n195\tINT -- SOLITARY WING -- NIGHT (1966) 195 \nLOW ANGLE on steel door. Somewhere behind it, unseen, is Andy, A rat scurries along the wall. FOOTSTEPS approach slowly. \n196\tINT -- SOLITARY -- NIGHT (1966) 196 \nAndy listens in darkness. The FOOTSTEPS pause outside his door. The slot opens. An ELDERLY GUARD peers in. \nELDERLY GUARD Kid passed. C-plus average. Thought you'd like to know. \nThe slot closes. The FOOTSTEPS recede. Andy smiles. \n197\tINT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1966) 197 \nWe find Tommy on evening work detail, mopping the floors with bucket and pail. Mert Entwhistle comes into view. \nMERT Warden wants to talk. \n198\tEXT -- PRISON -- NIGHT (1966) 198 \nA steel door rattles open. Mert leads Tommy outside to a gate, unlocks it. Tommy looks around. \nTOMMY Out here? \nMERT That's what the man said. \nMert swings the gate open, sends Tommy through, turns and heads back inside. Tommy proceeds out across a loading-dock access for the shops and mills. Some vehicles parked. The place is deserted. He stops, sensing a presence. \nTOMMY Warden? \nNorton steps into the light. \nANDY Mexico. Little place right on the Pacific. You know what the Mexicans say about the Pacific? They say it has no memory. That's where I'd like to finish out my life, Red. A warm place with no memory. Open a little hotel right on the beach. Buy some worthless old boat and fix it up like new. Take my guests out charter fishing. (beat) You know, a place like that, I'd need a man who can get things. \nRed stares at Andy, laughs. \nRED Jesus, Andy. I couldn't hack it on the outside. Been in here too long. I'm an institutional man now. Like old Brooks Hatlen was. \nANDY You underestimate yourself. \nRED Bullshit. In here I'm the guy who can get it for you. Out there, all you need are Yellow Pages. I wouldn't know where to begin. (derisive snort) Pacific Ocean? Hell. Like to scare me to death, somethin' that big. \nANDY Not me. I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover, and whatever mistakes I made I've paid for and then some. That hotel and that boat...I don't think it's too much to want. To look at the stars just after sunset. Touch the sand. Wade in the water. Feel free. \nRED Goddamn it, Andy, stop! Don't do that to yourself! Talking shitty pipedreams! Mexico's down there, and you're in here, and that's the way it is! \nANDY You're right. It's down there, and I'm in here. I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really. Get busy living or get busy dying. \nRed snaps a look. What the hell does that mean? Andy rises and walks away. Red lunges to his feet. \nRED Andy? \nANDY (turns back) Red, if you ever get out of here, do me a favor. There's this big hayfield up near Buxton. You know where Buxton is? \nRED (nods) Lots of hayfields there. \nANDY One in particular. Got a long rock wall with a big oak at the north end. Like something out of a Robert Frost poem. It's where I asked my (MORE) \nANDY (cont.) wife to marry me. We'd gone for a picnic. We made love under that tree. I asked and she said yes. (beat) Promise me, Red. If you ever get out, find that spot. In the base of that wall you'll find a rock that has no earthly business in a Maine hayfield. A piece of black volcanic glass. You'll find something buried under it I want you to have. \nRED What? What's buried there? \nANDY You'll just have to pry up that rock and see. \nAndy turns and walks away. \n206\tINT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1966) \nRED I tell you, the man was talkin' crazy. I'm worried, I truly am. \nSKEET We ought to keep an eye on him. \nJIGGER That's fine, during the day. But at night he's got that cell all to himself. \nHEYWOOD Oh Lord. Andy come down to the loading dock today. Asked me for a length of rope. Six foot long. \nSNOOZE Shit! You gave it to him? \nHEYWOOD Sure I did. I mean why wouldn't I? \nFLOYD Christ! Remember Brooks Hatlen? \nHEYWOOD How the hell was I s'pose to know? \nJIGGER Andy'd never do that. Never. \nThey all look to Red. \nRED Every man's got a breaking point. \n207\tEXT -- PRISON YARD -- ANGLE ON P.A. -- DUSK (1966) 207 \nVOICE (over P.A.) Report to your cellblocks for evening count. \nBOOM DOWN to Red and the boys. Convicts drift past them. \nFLOYD Where the hell is he? \nHEYWOOD Probably still up in the warden's. \nTOWER GUARD (via bullhorn) YOU MEN! YOU HEAR THAT ANNOUNCEMENT OR ZUST TOO STUPID TO UNDERSTAND? \nSKEET Christ. What do we do? \nFLOYD Nothing we can do. Not tonight. \nHEYWOOD Let's pull him aside tomorrow, all of us. Have a word with him. Ain't that right, Red? \nRED (unconvinced) Yeah. Sure. That's right. \n20B\tINT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- NIGHT (1966) 208 \nAndy's working away. Norton pokes his head in. \nNORTON Lickety-split. I wanna get home. \nANDY Just about done, sir. \nNorton and Hadley stride across the grounds, ALARM BLARING. \nNORTON I want every man on that cellblock questioned! Start with that friend of his! \nHADLEY who? \n219\tINT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 219 \nRed watches as Norton storms up with an entourage of guards. \nNORTON Him. \nRed's eyes widen. Guards yank him from his cell. \n220\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- DAY (1966) 220 \nNorton steps to the center of the room, working himself up into a fine rage: \nNORTON What do you mean \"he just wasn't here?\" Don't say that to me, Haig! Don't say that to me again! \nHAIG But sir! He wasn't! He isn't! \nNORTON I can see that, Haig! You think I'm blind? Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig? \nHAIG No sir! \nNorton grabs the clipboard and thrusts it at Hadley. \nNORTON What about you? You blind? Tell me what this is! \nHADLEY Last night's count. \nNORTON You see Dufresne's name? I sure do! Right there, see? \"Dufresne.\" He was in his cell at lights out! Stands to reason he'd still be here this morning! I want him found! Not tomorrow, not after breakfast! Now! \nHaig scurries out, gathering men. Norton spins to Red. \nNORTON Well? \nRED Well what? \nNORTON I see you two all the time, you're thick as thieves, you are! He must'a said something! \nRED No sir, he didn't! \nNorton spreads his arms evangelist-style, spins slowly around. \nNORTON Lord! It's a miracle! Man up and vanished like a fart in the wind! Nothin' left but some damn rocks on the windowsill and that cupcake on the wall! Let's ask her! Maybe she knows! What say there, Fuzzy- Britches? Feel like talking? Guess not. Why should you be different? \nRed exchanges looks with the guards. Even they're nervous. Norton scoops a handful rocks off the sill. He hurls them at the wall one at a time, shattering them, punctuating his words: \nNORTON It's a conspiracy! (SMASH) That's what this is! (SMASH) It's one big damn conspiracy! (SMASH) And everyone's in on it! (SMASH) Including her! \nHe sends the last rock whizzing right at Racquel. No smash. \nIt takes a moment for this to sink in. All eyes go to her. The rock went through her. There's a small hole in the poster where her navel used to be. \nYou could hear a pin drop. Norton reaches up, sinks his finger into the hole. He keeps pushing...and his entire hand disappears into the wall. \n221 \tANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 221 \nas Norton rips the poster from before our eyes. Stunned faces peer in. CAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK...to reveal the long crumbling tunnel in the wall. \n222\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 222 \nRORY TREMONT, a guard barely out of his teens, tries not to look nervous as they lash a rope around his chest. He's getting instructions from six different people at once. \nRED (V.O.) They got this skinny kid named Rory Tremont to go in the hole. He wasn't much in the brains department, but he possessed the one most important qualification for the job... (they slap a flashlight in his hands) ...he was willing to go. \n223\tINT -- TUNNEL -- DAY (1966) 223 \nRory squeezes down the tunnel on his belly. \nRED (V.O.) Probably thought he'd win a Bronze Star or something. \n224\tINT -- VERTICAL SHAFT -- DAY (1966) 224 \nDark as midnight. Concrete walls rise on both sides. If you imagine them as two huge slices of bread, the meat of this particular sandwich is about three feet of airspace and a dark tangle of pipes between the cellblocks. Rory's appears, shining his flashlight down the shaft. Somewhere, a rat SQUEAKS. \nRED (V.O.) It was his third day on the job. \nRORY Warden? There's a space here between the walls 'bout three feet across! Smells pretty damn bad! \nNORTON (O.S.) I don't care what it smells like! \nHADLEY (O.S.) Go on, boy! We got a hold of you! \nAndy strolls along, whistling softly, hands in both pockets. TILT DOWN to his pantleg. Concrete grit trickles out. \nRED (V.O.) It turns out Andy's favorite hobby was totin' his wall out into the exercise yard a handful at a time... \n236\tINT -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1962) 236 \nA GUARD strolls the tier, shining his flashlight into the cells. He pauses at Andy's bars, playing the beam over the sleeping form huddled under the blankets. \np37 REVERSE ANGLE (FROM INS1DE ANDY'S CELL) 237 \nWe see what the guard doesn't: instead of Andy's head under the blanket, it's a wadded-up pillow. The flashlight plays across the cell, pinning Marilyn Monroe in a circle of light. \n238 \tANGLE FROM BEHIND POSTER 238 \nThe light illuminates her face through the paper. WIDEN to reveal Andy lying in his tunnel, holding his breath. The light clicks off. The FOOTSTEPS move on. He gets back to work. \nRED (V.O.) While the rest of us slept, Andy spent years workin' the nightshift... \n239\tINT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1965) 239 \nBOOMING SLOWLY UP the shaft. Rats scurry the pipes. Suddenly, r piece of concrete the size of a quarter jumps free and plummets down the shaft as the rock-hammer pushes through. The pick withdraws, replaced by Andy's peering eye. \n240 \tA SERIES OF DISSOLVES (1965 through 1966) 240 \ntakes us through the widening of the hole. First as big as a tea cup. Then a saucer. Then a dinner plate. \nRED (V.O.) Probably took him most of a year just to get his head through. \nAndy finally gets his head through, scraping his ears. He's got a penlight clenched in his teeth. He peers down into the shaft. At the very bottom, maybe 20 feet down, a big ceramic pipe runs the length of the cellblock. Beneath its coat of grime and dust, the word \"SEWER\" is stenciled. \n241\tEXT -- LOADING DOCK ACCESS -- NIGHT (1966) 241 \nANGLE LOOKING STRAIGHT DOWN. Below us, Tommy Williams lies facedown at Norton's feet. Blood is spreading, fanning out oa the pavement. Norton turns, strolls out of frame. \nRED (V.O.) I guess after Tommy was killed, Andy decided he'd been here just about long enough. \nAgain we see: Andy working. Norton pokes his head in. \nNORTON Lickety-split. I wanna get home. \nANDY Just about done, sir. \nNorton crosses to the wall safe and works the dial, his back turned. This time, though, we stay on Andy: \nHe pulls up his sweater, yanks out a large black book and a stack of files, lays them on the desk. He then grabs the real ledger and files, jams them down his pants and smoothes his sweater down. He picks up the bogus stack, crosses to Norton, and shoves everything in. \n243\tINT -- HALLWAY -- NIGHT (1966) 243 \nNorton exits his office and strolls off whistling. PUSH IN on the open door. We see Andy at the guard's desk, pulling Norton's dress shoes from their box. \nRED (V.O.) Andy did like he was told. Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine. \n244\tINT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- MINUTES LATER (1966) 244 \nAndy sorts through Norton's three suits. He pauses, checking the gray pinstripe. Nice. \n245\tINT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- NIGHT (1966) 245 \nThe guard BUZZES Andy through. Andy walks toward us. \nRED (V.O.) The guard simply didn't notice. Neither did I. I mean, seriously, how often do you really look at a man's shoes? \nTILT DOWN as he passes by. Yep, he's wearing Norton's shoes. \n246\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 246 \nThe lights go out. Andy places the last chess piece. Gazes up at Racquel. Smiles. Pulls the rope from under his pillow. He stands and unbuttons his prison shirt, revealing Norton's gray pinstripe suit underneath. A FLASH OF LIGHTNING floods the cell, throwing wild shadows. \n247\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 247 \nThe storm rages. Andy, naked, carefully slips Norton's folded suit into a large industrial Zip-Lock bag. Next to go in are the shoes, chess pieces (already in a smaller bag), black ledger en files. Last but not least, a bar of soap wrapped in a towel. \n248\tINT -- TUNNEL -- NIGHT (1966) 248 \nAndy, again wearing prison clothes, inches down the tunnel. \n249\tINT -- SHAFT -- NIGHT (1966) 249 \nAndy squeezes through the hole head-first, emerges to the waist, He reaches for the opposite wall, manages to snag a steel conduit with his fingers. \nSuddenly, a huge rat darts for his hand. Andy yanks away and almost plummets head-first down the shaft. He dangles wildly upside-down for a moment, arms windmilling, then gets his hands pressed firmly against the opposite wall. The rat scurries off, pissed. \nAndy snags the conduit again. He contorts out of the hole and dangles into the shaft. We now see the purpose for the rope: the plastic bag hangs from his ankle with about two feet of slack, \nHe kicks his legs across the shaft, gets his feet braced. Wit3 his back against one wall and feet against the other, he starts down the shaft. Sliding dangerously. Using pipes for handholds. Flinching as rats dart this way and that, scurrying in the shadows. He drops the last few feet to the bottom. \nANGLE SHIFTS to reveal Captain Hadley. Staring. Waiting. \nD.A. You have the right to remain silent. If you give up that right, anything you say will be used against you in court... \nTROOPERS move in, cuffing Hadley's hands behind his back. The D.A. drones on. FLASHBULBS POP. Hadley says nothing. His face scrunches up. He begins to cry. \nRED (V.O.) I wasn't there to see it, but I hear Byron Hadley was sobbing like a little girl when they took him away. \nHadley sobs all the way to the car. The D.A. snaps a gaze up toward Norton's window, motions his men to follow. \n260\tINT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 260 \nNorton is staring out the window as they approach the building. He goes to his desk, opens a drawer. Inside lies a revolver and a box of shells. \nRED (V.O.) Norton had no intention of goin' that quietly. \n261\tINT -- PRISON CORRIDORS -- DAY (1966) 261 \nThe D.A. marches along amidst a phalanx of TROOPERS. \n262\tINT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 262 \nNorton sits blankly at his desk, revolver before him. The doorknob rattles, a VOICE is heard: \nD.A. (O.S.) Samuel Norton? We have a warrant for your arrest! Open up! \nThe POUNDING starts. Norton dumps the box of bullets out on thr desk. He starts sorting them to see which ones he likes. \n263 \tOUTSIDE HIS OFFICE 263 \nTroopers hustle the hapless duty guard to Norton's door as he fumbles nervously with a huge key ring. \nDUTY GUARD I'm not sure which one it is... \nHe starts trying keys in the lock. And as the keys go sliding in one after another... \n264\tINT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- DAY (1966) 264 \n...so do the bullets. Norton is riveted to the door. For every key, he loads another bullet. Methodical and grim. He gets the final bullet in just as the right key slams home. The door bursts open. Men muscle in. Somebody SHOUTS. Troopers dive in all directions as Norton raises the gun -- \n-- and jams it under his chin. his head snaps back as the wall goes red. His swivel chair does a slow half-turn and creaks to a final stop. Troopers rise slowly, gazing in horror. \nRED (V.O.) I like to think the last thing that went through his head...other than that bullet...was to wonder how the hell Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him. \nPUSH SLOWLY to the wall to reveal Mrs. Norton's framed sampler trickling blood and brains...and we get our final Bible lesson for today: \"HIS JUDGMENT COMETH AND THAT RIGHT SOON.\" \n265\tEXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1966) 265 \nMail call. Red hears his name. They pass him a postcard. \nRED (V.O.) Not long after the warden deprived us of his company, I got a postcard in the mail. It was blank. But the postmark said, \"McNary, Texas.\" \n266\tINT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1966) 266 \nRed sits with an atlas, tracing his finger down the page. \nRED (V.O.) McNary. Right on the border. That's where Andy crossed. (shuts the book) When I picture him heading south in his own car with the top down, it makes me laugh all over again... \n267\tEXT -- MEXICO -- HIGHWAY -- DAY (1966) 267 \nA red convertible rips along with Andy at the wheel, cigar jutting from his grin, warm wind fluttering his tie. \nRED (V.O.) Andy Dufresne, who crawled through a river of shit and came out clean on the other side. Andy Dufresne, headed for the Pacific. \n268\tINT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1966) 268 \nHeywood is regaling the table with some anecdote about Andy. \nRED (V.O.) Those of us who knew him best talk about him often. I swear, the stuff he pulled. It always makes us laugh. \nA wild burst of laughter. PUSH IN on Red. Feeling melancholy. \nRED (V.O.) Sometimes it makes me sad, though, Andy being gone. I have to remind myself that some birds aren't meant to be caged, that's all. Their feathers are just too bright... \n269\tEXT -- FIELDS -- LATE DAY (1966) 269 \nConvicts hoe the fields. Guards patrol on horseback. \nRED (V.O.) ...and when they fly away, the part of you that knows it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice...but still, the place you live is that much more drab and empty that they're gone. \nA DISTANT RUMBLE OF THUNDER. Red pauses, gazes off. Storm clouds coming in, backlit by the sun. A light drizzle begins. \nRED (V.O.) I guess I just miss my friend. \n270\tINT -- PRISON CELL -- NIGHT (1966) 270 \n280\tINT -- FOODWAY MARKET -- DAY 280 \nLoud. Jangling with PEOPLE and NOISE. We find Red bagging groceries. Registers are humming, kids are shrieking. Red calls to the STORE MANAGER: \nRED Sir? Restroom break sir? \nMANAGER (motions him over) You don't need to ask me every time you go take a piss. Just go. Understand? \n28l\tINT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 281 \nRed steps to the urinal, stares at himself in the wall mirror. \nRED (V.O.) Thirty years I've been asking permission to piss. I can't squeeze a drop without say-so. \nA strange east Indian guitar-whine begins. The Beatles. George Harrison's \"Within You Without You...\" \n282\tEXT -- STREET -- DAY 282 \n...which carries through as Red walks. People and traffic. He keeps looking at the women. An alien species. \nRED (V.O.) Women, too, that's the other thing. I forgot they were half the human race. There's women everywhere, every shape and size. I find myself semi-hard most of the time, cursing myself for a dirty old man. \nTWO YOUNG WOMEN stroll by in cut-offs and t-shirts. \nRED (V.O.) Not a brassiere to be seen, nipples poking out at the world. Jeezus, pleeze-us. Back in my day, a woman out in public like that would have been arrested and given a sanity hearing. \n283\tEXT -- PARK -- DUSK 283 \nRed finds the park filled with HIPPIES. Hanging out. Happening. Here's the source of the music: a radio. A HIPPIE GIRL gyrates to the Beatles, stoned, in her own world. \nRED (V.O.) They're calling this the Summer of Love. Summer of Loonies, you ask me. \n284\tINT -- PAROLE OFFICE -- DAY 284 \nRed sits across from his PAROLE OFFICER. The P.O. is filling out his report. \nP.O. You staying out of the bars, Red? \nRED Yes sir. That I am. \nP.O. How you doing otherwise? Adjusting okay? \nRED Things got different out here. \nP.O. Tell me about it. Young punks protesting the war. You imagine? Even my own kid. Oughtta bust his fuckin' skull. \nRED Guess the world moved on. \n285\tINT -- FOODWAY -- DAY 285 \nBagging groceries. CHILDREN underfoot. One points a toy gun at Red, pumping the trigger. Red focuses on the gun, listening to it CLICKETY-CLACK. Sparky wheel grinding. \nThe kids get swept off by MOM. Red starts bagging the next customer. SLOW PUSH IN on Red. Surrounded by MOTION and NOISE. Feeling like the eye of a hurricane. People everywhere, whipping around him like a gale. Strange. Loud. Dizzying. It gets distorted and weird, slow and thick, pressing in on him from all sides. The noise level intensifies. The hollering of children deepens and distends into LOW EERIE HOWLS. \nHe's in the grip of a major anxiety attack. Tries to shake himself out of it. Can't. Fumbles the final items into the bag. Walks away. Trying not to panic. Trying not to run. \nHe makes his way through the store. Blinking sweat. He bumps into a lady's cart, mumbles an apology, keeps going. Breaks into a trot. Down the aisle, cut to the left, through the door into the back rooms, faster and faster, running now, slamming through a door marked \"Employees Only\" into -- \n286\tINT -- EMPLOYEE RESTROOM -- DAY 286 \n-- where he slams the door and leans heavily against it, shutting everything out, breathing heavily. Alone now. \nHe goes to the sink, splashes his face, tries to calm down. He can still hear them out there. They won't go away. He glances around the restroom. Small. Not small enough. \nHe enters a stall. Locks the door. Puts the toilet lid down and sits on the john. Better. He can actually reach out and touch the walls now. They're close. Safe. Almost small enough. He draws his feet up so he can't be seen if somebody walks in. \nHe'll just sit here for a while. Until he calms down. \n287\tEXT -- STREET -- DUSK 287 \nRed is walking home. \nRED (V.O.) There is a harsh truth to face. No way I'm gonna make it on the outside. \nHe pauses at a pawnshop window. An array of handguns. \nRED (V.O.) All I do anymore is think of ways to break my parole. \nThe SHOPKEEPER appears at the glass, locking the door and flipping the sign: CLOSED. \n288\tINT -- RED'S ROOM -- NIGHT 288 \nRed lies smoking in bed. Unable to sleep. \nRED (V.O.) Terrible thing, to live in fear. Brooks Hatlen knew it. Knew it all too well. All I want is to be back where things make sense. Where I won't have to be afraid all the time. \n", "test1_input": "You're some sweet punk. You been broke in yet? \nAndy tries to step past them. He gets shoved around, nothing serious, just some slap and tickle. Jackals sizing up prey. \nBOGS Hard to get. I like that. \nAndy breaks free, flushed and shaking. He hurries off, leaving the three Sisters laughing. \n35\tINT -- ANDY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 35 \nAndy lies staring at the darkness, unable to sleep. \n36\tEXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1947) 36 \nExercise period. Red plays catch with Heywood and Jigger, lazily tossing a baseball around. Red notices Andy off to the side. Nods hello. Andy takes this as a cue to amble over. Heywood and Jigger pause, watching. \nANDY (offers his hand) Hello. I'm Andy Dufresne. \nRed glances at the hand, ignores it. The game continues. \nRED The wife-killin' banker. \nANDY How do you know that? \nRED I keep my ear to the ground. Why'd you do it? \nANDY I didn't, since you ask. \nRED Hell, you'll fit right in, then. (off Andy's look) Everyone's innocent in here, don't you know that? Heywood! What are you in for, boy? \nHEYWOOD Didn't do it! Lawyer fucked me! \nRed gives Andy a look. See? \nANDY What else have you heard? \nRED People say you're a cold fish. They say you think your shit smells sweeter than ordinary. That true? \nANDY What do you think? \nRED Ain't made up my mind yet. \nHeywood nudges Jigger. Watch this. He winds up and throws the ball hard -- right at Andy's head. Andy sees it coming out of the corner of his eye, whirls and catches it. Beat. He sends the ball right back, zinging it into Heywood's hands. Heywood drops the ball and grimaces, wringing his stung hands. \nANDY I understand you're a man who knows how to get things. \nRED I'm known to locate certain things from time to time. They seem to fall into my hands. Maybe it's 'cause I'm Irish. \nANDY I wonder if you could get me a rock-hammer? \nRED What is it and why? \nANDY You make your customers' motives a part of your business? \nRED If you wanted a toothbrush, I wouldn't ask questions. I'd just quote a price. A toothbrush, see, is a non-lethal sort of object. \nANDY Fair enough. A rock-hammer is about eight or nine inches long. Looks like a miniature pickaxe, with a small sharp pick on one end, and a blunt hammerhead on the other. It's for rocks. \nRED Rocks. \nAndy squats, motions Red to join him. Andy grabs a handful of dirt and sifts it through his hands. He finds a pebble and rubs it clean. It has a nice milky glow. He tosses it to Red. \nRED Quartz? \nANDY Quartz, sure. And look. Mica. Shale. Silted granite. There's some graded limestone, from when they cut this place out of the hill. \nRED So? \nANDY I'm a rockhound. At least I was, in my old life. I'd like to be again, on a limited scale. \nRED Yeah, that or maybe plant your toy in somebody's skull? \nANDY I have no enemies here. \nRED No? Just wait. \nRed flicks his gaze past Andy. Bogs is watching them. \nRED Word gets around. The Sisters have taken a real shine to you, yes they have. Especially Bogs. \nANDY Tell me something. Would it help if I explained to them I'm not homosexual? \nRED Neither are they. You have to be human first. They don't qualify. (off Andy's look) Bull queers take by force, that's all they want or understand. I'd grow eyes in the back of my head if I were you. \nANDY Thanks for the advice. \n", "test1_true": "ANDY If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good. \nRED Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the wall maybe? (Andy laughs politely) I miss the joke. What's so funny? \nANDY \nYou'll know when you see the rock- hammer. \nRED What's this item usually go for? \nANDY Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop. \nRED My standard mark-up's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about a special object. Risk goes up, price goes up. Call it ten bucks even. \nANDY Ten it is. \nRED I'll see what I can do. (rises, slapping dust) But it's a waste of money. \nANDY Oh? \nRED Folks who run this place love surprise inspections. They turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that. They'll find it, and you'll lose it. Mention my name, we'll never do business again. Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum. \nANDY I understand. Thank you, Mr...? \nRED Red. The name's Red. \nANDY Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you. \nThey shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go. \nRED (V.O.) I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled. like a man in a park without a care or worry. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. (resumes playing catch) Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start. \n37\tINT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1947) 37 \nRed gets his breakfast and heads for a table. Andy falls in step, slips him a tightly-folded square of paper. \n38\tINT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 38 \nLying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square. A ten dollar bill. \nRED (V.O.) He was a man who adapted fast. \n39\tEXT -- LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1947) 39 \nUnder watchful supervision, CONS are off-loading bags of dirty laundry from an \"Eliot Nursing Home\" truck. \nRED (V.O.) Years later, I found out he'd brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars... \nA certain bag hits the ground. The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look at a black con, LEONARD, then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot the shit. Leonard loads the bag onto a cart... \n40\tINT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 40 \nBags are being unloaded. We find Leonard working the line. \nRED (V.O.) When they check you into this hotel, one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works, just to make sure you're not carrying anything. But a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there. \nLeonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting... \n4l\tINT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41 \nRed deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where the clean sheets are being handed out. \nRED (V.O.) That's how Andy joined our happy little Shawshank family with more than five hundred dollars on his person. Determination. \nLeonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of clean sheets. He hands it across to Red -- \nTIGHT ANGLE \n-- and more than clean laundry changes hands. Two packs of cigarettes slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's. \n42\tINT -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1947) 42 \nRed slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. He pulls out the rock-hammer. It's just as Andy described. Red laughs softly. \nRED (V.O.) Andy was right. I finally got the joke. It would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these. \n43\tINT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1947) 43 \nBrooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. The rolling library. He finds Red waiting for him. Red slips the rock-hammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the cart. Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage. \nRED \nDufresne. \n", "test1_id": 2628, "test2_input": "Andy pulls a towel-wrapped bundle from his jacket and unfolds it. Jake. Andy lays him in the box, followed by Brook's letter. Red places the casket in the hole. A moment of silence. Andy gives Red with an encouraging nod. \nRED Lord. Brooks was a sinner. Jake was just a crow. Neither was much to look at. Both got institutionalized. See what you can do for 'em. Amen. \nMuttered \"amens\" all around. The boys shovel dirt onto the small grave and tamp it down. \n127\tINT -- SHAWSHANK CORRIDORS -- DAY (1955) 127 \nRAPID DOLLY with Hadley. He's striding, pissed-off, a man on e mission. He straight-arms a door and emerges onto -- \n128\tEXT -- SHAWSHANK PRISON WALL -- DAY (1955) 128 \n-- the wall overlooking the exercise yard. He leans on the railing, scans the yard, sees Andy chatting with Red. \nHADLEY Dufresne! What the fuck did you do? (Andy looks up) Your ass, warden's office, now! \nAndy shoots a worried look at Red, then heads off. \n129\tINT -- GUARD DESK/WARDEN'S OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 129 \nDozens of parcel boxes litter the floor. WILEY, the duty guard, picks through them. Hadley enters, trailed by Andy. \nANDY What is all this? \nHADLEY You tell me, fuck-stick! They're addressed to you, every damn one! \nWiley thrusts an envelope at Andy. Andy just stares at it. \nWILEY Well, take it. \nAndy takes the envelope, pulls out a letter, reads: \nANDY Dear Mr. Dufresne. In response to your repeated inquiries, the State Senate has allocated the enclosed funds for your library project... \" (stunned, examines check) This is two hundred dollars. \nWiley grins. Hadley glares at him. The grin vanishes. \nANDY In addition, the Library District has generously responded with a charitable donation of used books and sundries. We trust this will fill your needs. We now consider the matter closed. Please stop sending us letters. Yours truly, the State Comptroller's Office. \nAndy gazes around at the boxes. The riches of the world lay at his feet. His eyes mist with emotion at the sight. \nHADLEY I want all this cleared out before the warden gets back, I shit you not. \nHadley exits. Andy touches the boxes like a love-struck man touching a beautiful woman. Wiley grins. \nWILEY Good for you, Andy. \nANDY Only took six years. (beat) From now on, I send two letters a week instead of one. \nWILEY (laughs, shakes his head) I believe you're crazy enough. You better get this stuff downstairs like the Captain said. I'm gonna go pinch a loaf. When I get back, this is all gone, right? \nAndy nods. Wiley disappears into the toilet, Jughead Comix in hand. Alone now, Andy starts going through the boxes like a starving man exploring packages of food. He doesn't know where to turn first. He gets giddy, ripping boxes open and pulling out books, touching them, smelling them. \nHe rips open another box. This one contains an old phonograph player, industrial gray and green, the words \"Portland Public School District\" stenciled on the side. The box also contains stacks and stacks of used record albums. \nAndy reverently slips a stack from the box and starts flipping through them. Used Nat King Coles, Bing Crosbys, etc. He comes across a certain album -- Mozart's \"Le Nozze de Figaro.\" He pulls it from the stack, gazing upon it as a man transfixed. It is a thing of beauty. It is the Grail. \n130\tINT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 130 \nWiley sits in one of the stalls, Jughead comic on his knees. \n131\tINT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 131 \nAndy wrestles the phonograph player onto the guards' desk, sweeping things onto the floor in his haste. He plugs the machine in. A red light warms up. The platter starts spinning. \nHe slides the Mozart album from its sleeve, lays it on the platter, and lowers the tone arm to his favorite cut. The needle HISSES in the groove...and the MUSIC begins, lilting and gorgeous. Andy sinks into Wiley's chair, overcome by its beauty. It is \"Deutino: Che soave zeffiretto,\" a duet sung by \nSusanna and the Contessa. \n132\tINT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 132 \nWiley pauses reading, puzzled. He thinks he hears music. \nWILEY Andy? You hear that? \n133\tINT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 133 \nAndy shoots a look at the bathroom...and smiles. Go for broke. He lunges to his feet and barricades the front door, then the bathroom. He returns to the desk and positions the P.A. microphone. He works up his courage, then flicks all the toggles to \"on.\" A SQUEAL OF FEEDBACK echoes briefly... \n134 INT/EXT -- VARIOUS P.A. SPEAKERS -- DAY (1955) 134 \n...and the Mozart is suddenly broadcast all over the prison. \n135\tINT -- BATHROOM -- DAY (1955) 135 \nWiley lunges to his feet, pants tangling around his ankles. \n", "test2_true": "Cons all over the prison stop whatever they're doing, freezing in mid-step to listen, gazing up at the speakers. \n137 \tTHE STAMPING MACHINES IN THE PLATE SHOP ARE SHUT DOWN... 137 \n138 \tTHE LAUNDRY LINE GOES SILENT, GRINDING TO A HALT... 138 \n139 \tTHE WOOD SHOP MACHINES ARE TURNED OFF, BUZZING TO A STOP... 139 \n140 \tTHE MOTOR POOL...THE KITCHEN...THE LOADING DOCK...THE EXERCISE 140 thru yard...the numbing routine of prison life itself...all grinds thru 143 \tTO A STUTTERING HALT.

Ecstasy and rapture. Shawshank no longer exists. It has been banished from the mind of men. \n145\tEXT -- EXERCISE YARD -- DAY (1955) 145 \nCAMERA TRACKS along groups of men, all riveted. \nRED (V.O.) I have no idea to this day what them two Italian ladies were singin' about. Truth is, I don't want to know. Some things are best left unsaid. I like to think they were singin' about something so beautiful it can't be expressed in words, and makes your heart ache because of it. \nCAMERA brings us to Red. \nRED (V.O.) I tell you, those voices soared. Higher and farther than anybody in a gray place dares to dream. It was like some beautiful bird flapped into our drab little cage and made these walls dissolve away...and for the briefest of moments -- every last man at Shawshank felt free. \n146\tINT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- DAY (1955) 146 \nFAST DOLLY with Norton striding up the hallway with Hadley. \nRED (V.O.) It pissed the warden off something terrible. \n147\tINT -- GUARD STATION/OUTER OFFICE -- DAY (1955) 147 \nNorton and Hadley break the door in. Andy looks up with a sublime smile. We hear Wiley POUNDING on the bathroom door: \nWILEY (O.S.) LET ME OUUUUT! \n148\tINT -- SOLITARY WING -- DAY (1955) 148 \nLOW ANGLE SLOW PUSH IN on the massive, rust-streaked steel door. God, this is a terrible place to be. \nRED (V.O.) Andy got two weeks in the hole for that little stunt. \n149\tINT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT -- DAY (1955) 149 \nAndy doesn't seem to mind. His arms sweep to the music still playing in his head. We hear a FAINT ECHO of the soaring duet. \n150\tINT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1955) 1 50 \nHEYWOOD Couldn't play somethin' good, huh? Hank Williams? \nANDY They broke the door down before I could take requests. \nFLOYD Was it worth two weeks in the hole? \nANDY Easiest time I ever did. \nHEYWOOD Shit. No such thing as easy time in the hole. A week seems like a year. \nANDY I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company. Hardly felt the time at all. \nRED Oh, they let you tote that record player down there, huh? I could'a swore they confiscated that stuff. \nANDY (taps his heart, his head) The music was here...and here. That's the one thing they can't confiscate, not ever. That's the beauty of it. Haven't you ever felt that way about music, Red? \nRED Played a mean harmonica as a younger man. Lost my taste for it. Didn't make much sense on the inside. \nANDY Here's where it makes most sense. We need it so we don't forget. \nRED Forget? \nANDY That there are things in this world not carved out of gray stone. That there's a small place inside of us they can never lock away, and that place is called hope. \nRED Hope is a dangerous thing. Drive a man insane. It's got no place here. Better get used to the idea. \nANDY (softly) Like Brooks did? \nFADE TO BLACK \n151 \tAN IRON-BARRED DOOR 151 \nslides open with an enormous CLANG. A stark room beyond. CAMERA PUSHES through. SEVEN HUMORLESS MEN sit at a long \n", "test2_id": 2629, "test3_input": "165\tINT -- NORTON'S OFFICE -- NIGHT (1965) 165 \nANGLE on Maisie's pie. Several pieces gone. \nRED (V.O.) And behind every shady deal, behind every dollar earned... \nTILT UP to Andy at the desk, munching thoughtfully as he totals up figures on an adding machine. \nRED (V.O.) ...there was Andy, keeping the books. \nAndy finishes preparing two bank deposits. Norton hovers near the desk, keeping a watchful eye. \nANDY Two deposits, Casco Bank and New England First. Night drop, like always. \nNorton pockets the envelopes. Andy crosses to the wall safe and shoves the ledger and sundry files inside. Norton locks the safe, swings his wife's framed sampler back into place. He cocks his thumb at some laundry and two suits in the corner. \nNORTON Get my stuff down t'laundry. Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot. Tell 'em if they over- starch my shirts again, they're gonna hear about it from me. (adjusts his tie) How do I look? \nANDY Very nice. \nNORTON Big charity to-do up Portland way. Governor's gonna be there. (indicates pie) Want the rest of that? Woman can't bake worth shit. \n166\tINT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- NIGHT (1965) 166 \nAndy trudges down the corridor with Norton's laundry, the pie box under his arm. \n167\tINT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 167 \nTILT UP FROM PIE to find Red munching away as he helps Andy sort books on the shelves. \nRED Got his fingers in a lot of pies, from what I hear. \nANDY What you hear isn't half of it. He's got scams you haven't dreamed of. Kickbacks on his kickbacks. There's a river of dirty money flowing through this place. \nRED Money like that can be a problem. Sooner or later you gotta explain where it came from. \nANDY That's where I come in. I channel it, funnel it, filter it...stocks, securities, tax free municipals... I send that money out into the big world. And when it comes back... \nRED It's clean as a virgin's whistle? \nANDY Cleaner. By the time Norton retires, I will have made him a millionaire. \nRED Jesus. They ever catch on, he's gonna wind up wearing a number himself. \nANDY (smiles) I thought you had more faith in me than that. \nRED I'm sure you're good, but all that paper leaves a trail. Anybody gets too curious -- FBI, IRS, whatever -- that trail's gonna lead to somebody. \nANDY Sure it will. But not to me, and certainly not to the warden. \nRED Who then? \nANDY Peter Stevens. \nRED Who? \nANDY The silent, silent partner. He's the guilty one, your Honor. The man with the bank accounts. That's where the filtering process starts. They trace it back, all they're gonna find is him. \nRED Yeah, okay, but who the hell is he? \nANDY A phantom. An apparition. Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit. (off Red's look) I conjured him out of thin air. He doesn't exist...except on paper. \nRED You can't just make a person up. \nANDY Sure you can, if you know how the system works, and where the cracks are. It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail. Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate, social security card, driver's license. They ever track those accounts, they'll wind up chasing a figment of my imagination. \nRED Jesus. Did I say you were good? You're Rembrandt. \nANDY It's funny. On the outside, I was an honest man. Straight as an arrow. I had to come to prison to be a crook. \n168\tEXT -- PRISON YARD -- DUSK (1965) \nRED Does it ever bother you? \nANDY I don't run the scams, Red, I just process the profits. That's a fine line, maybe. But I've also built that library, and used it to help a dozen guys get their high school diplomas. Why do you think the warden lets me do all that? \nRED To keep you happy and doing the laundry. Money instead of sheets. \nANDY I work cheap. That's the trade-off. \nTWO SIREN BLASTS draw their attention to the main gate. It swings open, revealing a prison bus waiting outside. \n169\tINT -- PRISON BUS -- DUSK (1965) 169 \nAmong those on board is TOMMY WILLIAMS, a damn good-looking kid in his mid-20's. The bus RUMBLES through the gate. \n", "test3_true": "The new fish disembark, chained together single-file. The old- timers holler and shake the fence. A deafening gauntlet. \n171\tINT -- CELLBLOCK EIGHT -- NIGHT (1965) 171 \nTommy and the others are marched in naked and shivering, covered with delousing powder, greeted by TAUNTS and JEERS. \n172\tINT -- TOMMY'S CELL -- NIGHT (1965) 172 \nThe bars slam with a STEEL CLANG. Tommy and his new CELLMATE take in their new surroundings. \nTOMMY Well. Ain't this for shit? \n173\tINT -- PRISON CORRIDOR -- DAY (1965) 173 \nDOLLYING Tommy as he struts along, combing his ducktail, cigarette behind his ear. (We definitely need The Coasters or Del Vikings on the soundtrack here. Maybe Jerry Lee Lewis.) \nRED (V.O.) Tommy Williams came to Shawshank in 1965 on a two year stretch for B&E. Cops caught him sneakin' TV sets out the back door of a JC Penney. \n174\tINT -- WOOD SHOP -- DAY (1965) 174 \nA SHRIEKING BUZZSAW slices ten-foot lengths of wood. Red runs the machine while some other OLD-TIMERS feed the wood. \nRED (V.O.) Young punk, Mr. Rock n' Roll, cocky as hell... \nTommy is hauling the cut wood off the conveyor and stacking it, It's a ball-busting job, but the kid's a blur. \nTOMMY (slapping his gloves) C'mon there, old boys! Movin' like molasses! Makin' me look bad! \nThe old guys just grin and shake their heads. \nRED (V.O.) We liked him immediately. \n175\tINT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1965) 175 \nTommy regales the old boys with his exploits: \nTOMMY ...so I'm backin' out the door, right? Had the TV like this... (mimes his grip) Big ol' thing. Couldn't see shit. Suddenly, here's this voice: Freeze kid! Hands in the air! Well I just stand there holdin' on to that TV, so the voice says: \"You hear what I said, boy?\" And I say, Yes sir, I sure did! But if I drop this fuckin' thing, you got me on destruction of property too! \nThe whole table falls about laughing. \n176\tINT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 176 \nPoker game in progress. Tommy, Andy, Red and the boys. \nHEYWOOD You did a stretch in Cashman too? \nTOMMY Yeah. That was an easy ride, let me tell you. Work programs, weekend furloughs. Not like here. \nSNOOZE Sounds like you done time all over New England. \nTOMNY Been in and out since I was 13. Name the place, chances are I been there. \nANDY Perhaps it's time you considered a new profession. (the game stalls) What I mean is, you don't seem to be a very good thief. Maybe you should try something else. \nTOMMY What the hell you know about it, Capone? What are you in for? \nANDY (wry glance to Red) Everyone's innocent in here. Don't you know that? \nThe tension breaks. Everyone laughs. \n177\tINT -- VISITOR'S ROOM -- DAY (1965) 177 \nCAMERA TRAVELS the room. Chaotic. CONS are waiting their turn or talking to visitors through a thick plexi shield. \nRED (V.O.) As it turns out, Tommy had himself a young wife and new baby girl... \nTommy's at the end of the row, phone to his ear. Other side of the glass is BETH, near tears, fussing with a BABY on her lap. \nBETH ...said we can stay with them, but Joey's gettin' out of the service next month, and they barely got enough room as it is. Plus they got Poppa workin' double shifts and the baby cries half the night. I just don't know where we're gonna go... \nPUSH IN on Tommy's face as he listens. \nRED (V.O.) Maybe it was the thought of them on \nthe streets...or his child growing up not knowing her daddy... \n178\tINT -- LIBRARY -- DAY (1965) 178 \nTommy enters, the strut gone from his step. A little scared. He finds Andy filing library cards. \nRED (V.O.) Whatever it was, something lit a fire under that boy's ass. \nTOMMY I'm thinkin' maybe I should try for high school equivalency.

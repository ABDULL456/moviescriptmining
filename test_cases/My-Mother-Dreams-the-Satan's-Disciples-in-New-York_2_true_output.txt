Marian continues on.  She's distracted by ... 
A WOMAN in her thirties, who looks like she hasn't slept in a week, bent over the railing of a second-story fire escape balcony, in the throes of a veritable rage. 
WOMAN IN A RAGE You forgot your fucking plant, you fucking asshole! 
Marian stares up at her, even more disconcerted than ever. 
The enraged woman continues her tirade at an unseen old boyfriend below. 
WOMAN IN A RAGE And there's a lot of other shit in there you forgot.  Just wait there, I'm going to go fucking get it for you, all right? No, just wait there! Do you want me to go get it for you?  Well, why don't I just do that, huh?  I'm going to do that right now! 
Marian looks away and, intrepid Midwesterner that she is, pushes on. 
A MAN, dressed strangely, stands surreally in the middle of the street, blowing huge clouds of cigarette smoke. 
A GAY COUPLE parade past, laughing hysterically. 
NEW ANGLE - AT THE END OF THE STREET - 
A PACK of unmufflered, chrome-coruscating HARLEYS round the corner in a ear-shattering approach. 
MARIAN - 
stops dead in her tracks and stares in heartstopping terror.

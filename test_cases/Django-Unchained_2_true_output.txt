CUT TO 
ROY AND FLOYD go to the Cage Wagon to talk with the three mandingos. As they walk, Roy continues to study the handbill. 
ROY 
(READING ALOUD) "Wanted, dead or alive. Smitty Bacall and The Bacall Gang. For murder and stagecoach robbery. Seven thousand dollars for Bacall. One thousand five hundred dollars for each of his gang members... ." This is a real handbill. 
FLOYD Just because the handbill's real doesn't mean that other bunch of malarky.is. 
ROY Why would a nigger slave have a wanted dead or alive handbill in his pocket? Floyd doesn't have an answer for that one. 
ROY That black's damn convincing. They get to The Cage O'Men. Roy startles them with a direct question; 
ROY (pointing, behind him, at Django) That black ride into Candyland yesterday? The Caged Men don't know what they're suppose to say. Roy removes the pistol from his belt, cocks back the hammer and points the barrel at the cage. 
ROY I'm gonna ask again, and remember I don't like liars. Is he a Candyland slave, or did he ride in with a white man yesterday? 
CHESTER Yeah. They walked us from the Greenville Auction and he rode on a horse with a white man. 
ROY This white man, was the black his slave? 
RODNEY He weren't no slave. 
FLOYD You sure about that? 
RODNEY Damn sure. Roy starts taking the possibility of an eleven thousand dollar windfall seriously. 
ROY What happened at Candyland? 
CHICKEN CHARLY Bunch of shootin, master got shot. 
ROY Who shot 'em? 
CHICKEN CHARLY The German. 
ROY And why did he do that? 
CHICKEN CHARLY The nigger and the German were actin as if they were slavers, but they weren't. 
ROY What were they? 
RODNEY Bounty hunters. Floyd is starting to get convinced. 
FLOYD Goddamn Roy, this could be big. (to the Slaves) Do you know who Smitty Bacall is? 
!Y, 
ROY (barking at Floyd) They wouldn't go by their outlaw names you idiot! 
CUT TO Roy and Floyd walk back to Django and Jano. 
ROY Okay black, you gotta deal. Jano reacts. 
DJANGO I got one more condition. 
ROY What? 
DJANGO When we get there, when the time comes, you let me help you kill 'em. Roy whips out a big knife, and cuts the rope around Django's wrists. 
ROY 
(LAUGHING) You got a deal, black. Django interrupts - 
DJANGO You gotta deal, mate. Roy really laughs this time. As does Django and the other two Aussies. 
ROY You're all right for a black fella! 
THE CAGE Rodney, Chicken Charly, and Chester watch the sight of the white men cutting the ropes that bound the black man's wrists, as well as them all sharing a laugh, with wonderment. "Who is this Nigger?" 
BACK WITH THE LAUGHING QUARTET

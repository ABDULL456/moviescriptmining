LISA I'm positive. 
DELANEY I better tell the orderlies. This is no place for a little girl to be. 
CUT TO: 
29.INT. WARD B 足 LATER Lisa is polishing a table. Delaney walks in with HARDCASTLE,a well built man with a skinhead and visible tattoos on his arms. LISA Did you find her? 
DELANEY No. 
HARDCASTLE So you're the one who saw the little girl huh? 
LISA Yes. 
HARDCASTLE You sure you saw a little girl? 
LISA Of course. 
HARDCASTLE Well I've had to pull staff off other wards to search this goddamn place top to bottom. We found nothing. 
LISA That's strange. 
HARDCASTLE A big fucking inconvenience is what it is! Do me a favour, the next time you think you see something be absolutely sure before you go running to Jumpsuit here! I ain't got time to be running around this place looking for shit that isn't there! You understand?? 
LISA Yes. 
Hardcastle exits. Lisa looks embarrassed. 
LISA Sorry. 
DELANEY Don't worry about it. Better safe than sorry. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
30.INT.STAIRCASE 足 HIGH HOPES HOSPITAL-NEXT NIGHT 
Lisa walks tentatively down the staircase carrying a mop and bucket. A clock on the wall reads 3:15am. 
CUT TO: 
31.INT. WARD X 足 CONTINUOUS 
Lisa walks into Ward X. She looks down the dimly lit hallway and pauses for a moment. Overcoming her nerves, she places the bucket on the floor and starts mopping. 
As she edges through the hallway Lisa notices a light flickering from underneath one of the cell doors. She walks over and slowly reaches for the hatch. Sliding it open Lisa peers inside. In the centre of the floor she sees a needle, a piece of paper and a piece of red wool surrounded by Six lit candles. She looks around and nobody seems to be in the cell. 
Suddenly SADIE jumps up right in front of the hatch! Lisa FALLS backwards, letting out an involuntary SCREAM! She stumbles to her feet as Sadie laughs. Lisa slams the hatch shut and rushes towards the exit. 
CUT TO: 
32.INT. STORAGE CUPBOARD 足 NIGHT 
Delaney is sifting through a tool box. Lisa stands in the doorway.

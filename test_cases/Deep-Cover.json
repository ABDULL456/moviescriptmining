{"test1_input": "STEVENS He ought to be wearing a sign. \nCARVER You can tell he's a cop? \nStevens laughs: it's obvious. \nA real DRUG DEALER joins the cop. UNDERCOVER COP: \"You got it?\" DEALER: \"In the motel, right over here...\" The Cop's uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the CAMERA as they go. \nSTEVENS He keeps looking for his back-up. Now, the other guy knows it, too. \nCARVER Then why's he taking him to the room? \nSTEVENS (why else?) To rip him off. \nCarver studies Stevens in the darkness, impressed. \nON SCREEN: The figures disappear into the motel. We hear their voices. DEALER: \"Here, try some of it.\" UNDERCOVER COP: \"Uhh... No, I don't...\" DEALER: \"Why not, you sonofabitch?\" Two bursts of SOUND DISTORTION. \nA plainclothes cop, TAFT, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts from behind the CAMERA, sprints toward the motel. The CAMERA wobbles after him. \nSTEVENS (continuing) Too late. \nON SCREEN: The CAMERA (jerky, hand-held) nears the open motel door. Taft is bent over the Undercover Cop's body. \nTAFT Oh, Bobby... Jesus, Jesus... (to the CAMERA) Get an ambulance -- and back up. Now! \nHe slams the wall, starts past the CAMERA. Carver pushes the pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of Taft's face. \nSTEVENS (focussed on Taft) Who is he? \nCARVER Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics. \nSTEVENS He's a good cop. \nCARVER He's a great cop. Two [names citation] and a [another citation]. As tough as they come and twice as honest. \nCarver watches Stevens watch Taft, smiles at something. \nSTEVENS But the cops aren't getting it done here, are they? Gotta try something new... \nHe opens a manila envelope, dumps the contents on the desk: driver's license, social security card, high school transcript, prison records... all in the name of William G. Hull. No photos. \nSTEVENS (continuing) Who's John Hull? \nCARVER You are. If you want to be. (off Stevens) Most undercover guys don't know what they're doing because it's a day gig. (indicates dead cop on TV) I need somebody who goes under and stays there; six months, a year, five years... \nSTEVENS What does he have to do? \nCARVER Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me information. \nSTEVENS He's a snitch. \nCARVER He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A scumbag. But for the right side. (beat) I want you to come to Los Angeles on loan to the Justice Department as a federal agent. Your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here. And you'll come back to Cleveland a P3 or higher. \nSTEVENS (uncomfortable) I can't do that. I've got a wife and kids. \nCARVER You're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce. You see your kids every other weekend. \nStevens takes a breath: this is awkward to explain. \nSTEVENS (almost a confession) All my life I've stayed away from that stuff. I've never touched drugs. \nCARVER (tolerant) Come on, a little grass...? \nSTEVENS Not grass. Not nothing. I never even had a drink. (his motto) Never have, never will. You don't understand. I made a choice in my life. \nCARVER What's to understand? You saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like that. (off Stevens' surprise, Carver grins) I'm God, I know everything. You wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop. Hiding out in uniform... That's why you got the hard-on for Taft. \nSTEVENS It's not that simple. \nCARVER (opening Joe's file; as if reluctantly) I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're never going to be a Taft. \nSTEVENS I don't believe that. \nBut he does. \nCARVER (looks at MMPI results) You ever take a look at your psychological profile? You score almost like a criminal. (reading) \"Resents authority...\" \n", "test1_true": "CARVER \"...Exaggerated moral standards, but with no underlying value system.\" Look at the anger, the repressed violence, it's almost off the scale... \nSTEVENS Let me see that... \nCarver hands him the scores which are, of course, just clusters of numbers. Stevens is upset, though oddly unsurprised, as if this only confirmed his secret fears. \nCARVER Why'd you join the force? \nSTEVENS (awkward, but felt) I wanted to be of use. \nCARVER Well, now you can be. You won't be Taft, but maybe you'll be something more... interesting. (sits back) There's a man named Ramon Gallegos who supplies 60% of the cocaine to the West Coast. He's smart, smooth, and sufficiently elusive that we don't even have an adult photograph of him. However, his uncle is Hector Guzman, an important Latin American political figure. Gallegos uses Uncle's connections to get product into the country, and everyone we've sent after him has ended up like that... \nIndicates dead body on TV. \nSTEVENS Why would I be different? \nCARVER You already are, that's the point... (indicates file, test scores) You've got the ability and the personality to go underground and blend in completely. That's what the others couldn't. Some part of them showed. That's why they're dead. See, there's only one rule in this game. \nStevens raises his eyebrows: what? \nCARVER (continuing) Don't blow your cover. \nEXT. WORKING CLASS CLEVELAND NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nStevens parks outside a small, well-maintained house. As he gets out, he spots a GROUP OF KIDS (black and Hispanic) playing down the street. He's not pleased about that. \nSTEVENS (calls to them) Joe-J, Carmen... \nA BOY, 7, and a GIRL, 5, (both light-skinned) run to him shouting, \"Daddy,\" jump into his arms, competing for attention, as if they haven't seen him in ages. \nSTEVENS What were you doing with those kids? \nJOE-J & CARMEN Playing... \nSTEVENS (displeased) Your mom lets you play with them? \nJOE-J & CARMEN Yes, sir... Yes, sir. \nHis strictness has already sobered their enthusiasm. Sensing this, he attempts to embrace them which he can do only awkwardly. \nMeanwhile, his wife, TERRY (Southern white) has come out the screen door. She and Stevens bristle at each other. \nSTEVENS I thought we talked about this. The older brother up there's got a sheet with -- \nTERRY Lay off it. They're just kids... \nBoth are ready to fight, but restrain themselves. A big Polynesian, TITO comes out the door. \nTITO Hey, Joe. \nSTEVENS Tito... \nA moment of surprise, then he gets it. He looks to Terry. She gives a little shrug, refusing to be embarrassed. \nINT. KITCHEN - FIVE MINUTES LATER \nStevens is trying to seem interested in Carmen's little drawings. \nSTEVENS They're real nice, honey. Is that a horse? \nCARMEN (exasperated) Daddy! It's a bunny... \nShe puts her arms around him. \nCARMEN (continuing) I don't want you to go away, Daddy. \nSTEVENS It's my work. I've got to. \nOver her shoulder he sees Terry sitting with a subdued Joe- J. Her face seems to say, \"See, I told you...\" Avoiding this accusation, Stevens notices a bruise on Carmen's arm. \nSTEVENS (continuing) What happened to you there, baby? \nCARMEN Tito did it. \nSTEVENS (instantly outraged) He hit you?! (up in a fury) God damn it, what's he doing touching her? I'm gonna... \n", "test1_id": 1047, "test2_input": "He empties his pockets of all that gushed out of the Winnebago, empties a satchel as well until it fills the room like snow. \nEXT. MOTEL - NIGHT \nHull putting Betty into an airport limousine. \nHULL (to the driver) International terminal. (to Betty) I'll meet you there in a week. \nShe kisses him. He's about to close the door. She stops it. \nMCCUTCHEON You know the first time, when I saw you in the bar...? \nHULL (smiles at the memory) You wouldn't even look at me. \nMCCUTCHEON 'Cause I knew what you were thinking. You were judging me. \nHULL No, I wasn't, I was... \nMCCUTCHEON You were. Your eyes were like an angel in my heart telling me I should be good, and I didn't want to hear it. \nThis news startles Hull, yet, strangely, he senses its truth, and the sweetness is more than he can bear. \nMCCUTCHEON (continuing) That's you, too. Maybe this is you, I don't know, but I know that's you. \nShe closes the door. The car pulls away. \nIn an unmarked car up the street, Taft picks up the radio. \nEXT. A LATIN AMERICAN CONSULATE - DAY \nA limousine pulls into the gate and disgorges RENALDO GUZMAN, 55, and his wife, 25. They're shown into the consulate. \nThe limousine pulls out onto the street and parks. Gopher appears, knocks on the driver's window. It comes down. They chat briefly in Spanish. Gopher opens up a cellular phone. \nINT. A HOTEL ROOM - SANTA MONICA - DAY \nOverlooking the ocean. Hull pacing nervously, Elias relaxed, reading the paper. \nHULL What if we forget all this? Take ten million each and disappear. Leave the country. New identities, new lives... \nELIAS What's the matter, John? Having doubts? \nHULL Yeah. \nA phone RINGS. Elias picks up his own cellular. \nELIAS Yes... Where?... No! No way... We pick the time and place... Otherwise no meet... (looks to Hull who nods his agreement) Got a pencil? \nEXT. CONSULATE - LIMO - DAY \nGopher hands a piece of paper to the limo driver. He walks away... \nAROUND THE CORNER \nAs he's about to get into a car, Taft grabs him. Gopher is surprised and not pleased. \nEXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT \nWhere Hull and Elias left the Winnebago. Guzman's limo approaches. Frank, the attendant, waves it on. \nINT. GARAGE - NIGHT \nThe limo climbs the ramps until it comes to Elias's car, parked where the Winnebago was; the Winnie is nowhere in sight. The limo pulls alongside. \nHull and Elias get out. Molto gets out of the limo. Then Renaldo Guzman. \nELIAS We have a proposal to make. We regret what happened to your nephew... \nGUZMAN Say what you have to say. \nELIAS We all know that your cousin's business is coming to an end. Costs have climbed while profits and the market -- \nGuzman waves: get to the point. \nELIAS (continuing) We have developed a new product: simpler, cheaper to manufacture, superior quality and completely synthetic. Therefore, no growing, no refining, no peasants, no importing, no customs agents... Here's a detailed prospectus with anticipated cash flow and so forth. \nHe hands a copy to Guzman and the lawyer. \n", "test2_true": "ELIAS There are no Americans anymore, Mr. Guzman, you know that. No Hispanics, no Japanese, no blacks, no whites, no anything. There are only rich people and poor people. We're rich, so we're on the same side. \nEXT. GARAGE - NIGHT \nTaft with Gopher in his car. \nTAFT Do they have money in there? \nGOPHER I don't know. \nTAFT They wouldn't meet here otherwise. \nGopher shrugs; a decision: Taft picks up his radio. \nTAFT (continuing) Okay, everybody, here's the play... \nINT. GARAGE - NIGHT \nELIAS We're prepared to give you 80% of the money. The remainder you invest in our business with proceeds paid out according to the figures there. \nHe indicates the prospectus that Guzman has been looking through. \nGUZMAN This looks interesting. I'd have to confirm everything, of course. Do you have a sample of the product? \nElias produces one. Guzman gestures to Molto. Molto samples it. Molto's eyes widen. \nMOLTO Buy it! \nGUZMAN Where is our money? \nElias hands him a key, points to a different Winnebago. Molto takes the key, unlocks the back: money. He signals okay to Guzman. \nSuddenly: SIRENS. Police cars wail into the garage. The THWACK- THWACK and sweeping light of a helicopter descend toward the roof (though we never see the copter). \nGUZMAN (continuing; anger) You set this up. \nHULL They're after us, not you. \nEverybody scatters. The garage is a labyrinth of cement stairwells, ramps, hundreds of RVs to hide between, under and so forth... Lots of NOISE, lights, but mostly we see Hull and Elias dodging here, avoiding the action. \nINT. ANOTHER PART OF THE GARAGE - NIGHT \nMolto caught between the lights. He draws his gun. GUNFIRE. He's cut down. \nTAFT (screaming) Where are the rest of them? \nEXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT \nCars with rotating dome lights, but not many cops. \nHull and Elias emerge from a shadowy doorway and make their way at a casual pace beyond the perimeter of police cars, quickly mingling with other spectators. They continue down... \nEXT. A QUIET SIDE STREET - NIGHT \nStrolling now. Elias elated, uncontained joy. \nELIAS We did it. Twenty million. Twenty fucking million. We're going to have synthetics. We're gonna be rich. We're gonna... \nHull stops walking and just stands there. \nELIAS (continuing) What's the matter, John? Be happy. Your whole life has just been solved. \nVOICE (behind them) Stop! Police! \nIn one motion, Elias draws his gun, turns and FIRES. \nThe figure goes down. Elias can't believe he hit him. \nHull starts toward the figure. \nELIAS (heading the other way) John, where are you going? \nTaft -- on the ground. \nHULL Oh, Jesus, no... \n", "test2_id": 1048, "test3_input": "He drops to his knees. Blood oozes from Taft's chest. \nELIAS John, what the hell are you doing? Let's get out of here. \nHull tries to hold closed the wound. The posture duplicates Hull with his dying father. He feels for a pulse. For breath. \nHULL (distraught) He's dying. \nELIAS Let him die. Let him die twice. Come one. \nHe pulls at Hull who won't go. Hull does mouth-to-mouth. Taft opens his eyes, looks up at him. \nHULL [Says to Taft whatever a CPR-trained policeman would say in this situation.] (to Elias) Get help. \nELIAS Are you kidding me? \nTAFT (to Hull, getting it) Oh, man, you're a cop. You're a cop, aren't you? \nHULL (with difficulty, as if against his will) Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a fucking cop... \nELIAS (laughs) Oh, really? Where's you badge? \nHULL I don't have one. I'm undercover. Get help, David. \nELIAS John, that's a cop. He tried to kill you. \nHULL He didn't know. \nELIAS Oh, he didn't know. I don't know. Maybe you don't know. Maybe you think you're a cop because... because... \nHULL Drop the gun, put your hands against the car. Spread your legs... Police! \nTaft grunts once, stiffens. \nHULL (continuing) My God! Please... \nThe pulse is gone. Hull begins to perform CPR. \nELIAS Okay, let's say you're a cop. Be a cop. \nHull keeps doing CPR. \nELIAS (continuing) We've still got the money. We put it into Randy's chemistry set. In five years we're worth five hundred million each, minimum. You'll be one of the richest black men in America. Richer than Cosby. Who gives a shit how you got it? You think the white ones were honest? \nHull keeps working on Taft. \nELIAS (continuing) Is this asshole all that stands between you and greatness? Let me do you a favor. \nHe puts a gun to Taft's head and FIRES. In a reflex, Hull draws his own gun, SHOOTS Elias in the stomach. Stunned, he wobbles backward a few steps. Sits on the street. \nELIAS (continuing) Gee, John, that's kind of an extreme reaction. \nHull is stunned he did it. And this finally attracts the police who see a black man with a gun who just shot a white man. \nHull goes to Elias who's dead. A POLICEMAN pulls him off, beating him with a gun. \nPOLICEMAN Fucking nigger... \nINT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY \nHull, bandaged, wearing prison blues, walking with Carver. \nHULL What about Guzman? \nCARVER He vanished, thank God, or we'd both be in deep doo-doo. At least you got Gallegos. \nHULL Elias did. And everything goes on as before. \nCARVER That's the drug game. Plus a change... I want you to come back to work for me. You'll beat all charges on a technicality and go back to who you were. \nHULL Who was I, Ger? \nCARVER Does anyone really know? \nHULL I have other things to do. \nCARVER Like travel? Tangiers, maybe? \n", "test3_true": "CARVER (continuing) I'm God, remember? \nHe beckons him. He walks him over to a cell. Through a one- way window they see: \nBETTY \nalone in the cell, unaware she's being watched. \nCARVER Go back to work, she walks out of here. Otherwise, she's up on multiple counts, and I'll see to it the judge runs them consecutively. \nHull just looks at him. Carver shrugs apologetically. \nINT. ANOTHER ROOM \nAbsolutely white. Not a window, not a stick of furniture. The only deviation is Hull in prison blues. \nThe door opens, Betty comes in wearing prison yellows. She sits on a nearly invisible chair. They know they're being watched. \nMCCUTCHEON They want me to testify against you. I said I wouldn't. \nHULL You have to. It's all set up. That's how you're getting off. \nShe shakes her head in cynical understanding. How difficult it is to get back to an honorable life. \nHe takes her hand. \nHULL (continuing; with difficulty) My father didn't have a heart attack. \nShe looks at him. \nHULL (continuing) He was shot robbing a liquor store. Trying to rob it. I lied about that. \nMCCUTCHEON Baby, why are you telling me this? \nHULL I had to start somewhere... There're other things you don't know... \nAN IRIS SHOT - HULL AND BETTY \nSilent. Kissing. Beginning to make love. Hull extracts himself, gives the finger to the POV and stuffs a bit of tissue in the iris, blocking our view. \nEXT. ROOM - DAY \nCarver takes his eye from the now obscured peephole. \nEXT. A CEMETERY - DAY \nA funeral. Taft's wife and children (from the wallet photo) leave the graveside with the rest of the funeral party. \nWhen everyone is gone, Hull approaches the grave. From his pocket, he removes the four blood-soaked bills his father gave him, and wedges these among the stems of flowers that already cover the plot. \nHe's silent a moment, then he gets up. He joins Carver who's standing with Hull's children. The kids each take his hand, they walk together. \nCARVER Betty walked out of court free this morning. That's my side of the deal. \nHULL (to the children) You two run on ahead. \nThey do. Hull watches them go. \nCARVER Her probation gets revoked the minute you fuck up. I want you to stay away from her altogether. \nHULL You know the difference between a black man and a nigger? \nCarver smiles, shakes his head. He likes a good joke. Hull punches him so hard in the stomach that he goes to his knees. \nHULL (continuing) The nigger's the one who'd even think about doing what you tell him. \nHe walks away. Still on his knees, doubled over, Carver whispers after him: \nCARVER Don't blow your cover. \nFADE OUT. \nTHE END \nDeep Cover Writers : \u00a0\u00a0Michael Tolkin\u00a0\u00a0Henry Bean Genres : \u00a0\u00a0Action\u00a0\u00a0Crime\u00a0\u00a0Thriller User Comments \n", "test3_id": 1049}

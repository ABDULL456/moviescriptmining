{"train": "DEEP COVER \nWritten by \nMichael Tolkin and Henry Bean \nStory by \nMichael Tolkin \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nEXT. CLEVELAND STREET - NIGHT (1970) \nRain. Christmas lights. A rusted out '56 Lincoln rattles down the bleak boulevard. In it: JOE STEVENS, an angry, black man in his late 20's, beside him his 10-year-old son, JOE JR. \nJoe Jr. stares out the window at passing: boarded buildings, whores with raincoats over their heads trying to flag down a john, a black Santa, a knot of drinkers. Breaking the silence: \nJOE STEVENS Your mother okay? \nJOE JR. Yes, sir. \nThey stop at a light. Joe Stevens tries to furtively snort a little something. He spots Joe Jr. watching. \nJOE STEVENS (firm, without irony) Don't you do this shit, boy. Don't you ever fuckin' touch it, you hear me? \nJoe Jr. stares, silent; Joe Jr.'s about to hit him. \nJOE STEVENS (continuing) You hear me, goddam it? \nThe boy nods. Satisfied, Joe Sr. draws in the stuff. It makes him feel good, strong, worried and determined all at once. \nJOE STEVENS (continuing; charged up) What do you want for Christmas? \nJOE JR. I don't know. \nJOE STEVENS (light changes; he accelerates) You don't know?? You gotta know what you want, boy, if you ever expect to get it. \nA sudden charm to his bravado. Joe Jr. smiles uncertainly. Joe Sr. grins back, pulls up in front of a liquor store. \nJOE STEVENS (continuing) Wait here. This won't take a minute. \nJoe Jr. doesn't notice or doesn't remark that his father, just before entering the store, draws a handgun from beneath his coat. \nThe boy gazes dreamily at the street. The lunatic Black Santa marches by, ranting to himself (\"Then the white man say...\"). The RAIN HAMMERS on the roof and windshield. Joe Jr. breathes on the glass, fogging the scene. \nFrom the store: MUFFLED GUNFIRE. \nJoe Jr. looks that way. Another GUNSHOT, then: \nHis father comes out the door clutching money in one hand. He strides toward the car with a reckless pride. He doesn't notice: \nThe liquor store door opens behind him. \nA SHOTGUN BLAST. Joe Stevens' guts splatter onto the car windshield. A look of terrible amazement; he sinks to his knees. \nJOE JR. Daddy!! \nHe jumps from the car, kneels by his father. \nThe STORE OWNER (47, Slavic) drags the gun toward them, bleeding profusely. \nSTORE OWNER (enraged, almost to tears) Fuckin' niggers... fuckin' niggers... \nJOE STEVENS \nlooks at the money in his hand: two 20's, two 5's. \nJOE STEVENS Fifty bucks... fifty goddam bucks. (looks up at his son) I'm sorry... \nHe stuffs the blood-soaked bills in the boy's shirt pocket and dies. Joe Jr. looks up at... \nTHE STORE OWNER \nBloody, nearly unconscious, he aims the shotgun at the boy who is too frightened to move. \nJOE JR. Please, Mister... \nSTEVENS He ought to be wearing a sign. \nCARVER You can tell he's a cop? \nStevens laughs: it's obvious. \nA real DRUG DEALER joins the cop. UNDERCOVER COP: \"You got it?\" DEALER: \"In the motel, right over here...\" The Cop's uneasy, keeps glancing back toward the CAMERA as they go. \nSTEVENS He keeps looking for his back-up. Now, the other guy knows it, too. \nCARVER Then why's he taking him to the room? \nSTEVENS (why else?) To rip him off. \nCarver studies Stevens in the darkness, impressed. \nON SCREEN: The figures disappear into the motel. We hear their voices. DEALER: \"Here, try some of it.\" UNDERCOVER COP: \"Uhh... No, I don't...\" DEALER: \"Why not, you sonofabitch?\" Two bursts of SOUND DISTORTION. \nA plainclothes cop, TAFT, (black, stocky, powerful) bolts from behind the CAMERA, sprints toward the motel. The CAMERA wobbles after him. \nSTEVENS (continuing) Too late. \nON SCREEN: The CAMERA (jerky, hand-held) nears the open motel door. Taft is bent over the Undercover Cop's body. \nTAFT Oh, Bobby... Jesus, Jesus... (to the CAMERA) Get an ambulance -- and back up. Now! \nHe slams the wall, starts past the CAMERA. Carver pushes the pause button; the tape freezes on a jerky image of Taft's face. \nSTEVENS (focussed on Taft) Who is he? \nCARVER Charles Taft. LAPD Narcotics. \nSTEVENS He's a good cop. \nCARVER He's a great cop. Two [names citation] and a [another citation]. As tough as they come and twice as honest. \nCarver watches Stevens watch Taft, smiles at something. \nSTEVENS But the cops aren't getting it done here, are they? Gotta try something new... \nHe opens a manila envelope, dumps the contents on the desk: driver's license, social security card, high school transcript, prison records... all in the name of William G. Hull. No photos. \nSTEVENS (continuing) Who's John Hull? \nCARVER You are. If you want to be. (off Stevens) Most undercover guys don't know what they're doing because it's a day gig. (indicates dead cop on TV) I need somebody who goes under and stays there; six months, a year, five years... \nSTEVENS What does he have to do? \nCARVER Buy drugs. Sell drugs. Feed me information. \nSTEVENS He's a snitch. \nCARVER He's a drug dealer. A criminal. A scumbag. But for the right side. (beat) I want you to come to Los Angeles on loan to the Justice Department as a federal agent. Your experience there will be credited toward your seniority here. And you'll come back to Cleveland a P3 or higher. \nSTEVENS (uncomfortable) I can't do that. I've got a wife and kids. \nCARVER You're separated from your wife, she's filled for divorce. You see your kids every other weekend. \nStevens takes a breath: this is awkward to explain. \nSTEVENS (almost a confession) All my life I've stayed away from that stuff. I've never touched drugs. \nCARVER (tolerant) Come on, a little grass...? \nSTEVENS Not grass. Not nothing. I never even had a drink. (his motto) Never have, never will. You don't understand. I made a choice in my life. \nCARVER What's to understand? You saw your father killed when you were ten, and you decided you wouldn't be like that. (off Stevens' surprise, Carver grins) I'm God, I know everything. You wanted to be a good boy, so you became a cop. Hiding out in uniform... That's why you got the hard-on for Taft. \nSTEVENS It's not that simple. \nCARVER (opening Joe's file; as if reluctantly) I'll tell the truth, Joe. You're never going to be a Taft. \nSTEVENS I don't believe that. \nBut he does. \nCARVER (looks at MMPI results) You ever take a look at your psychological profile? You score almost like a criminal. (reading) \"Resents authority...\" \nTerry intercepts him on his way out of the room. \nTERRY She was running behind his chair when he got up. It was an accident. (he's uncertain) A complete... total... accident. \nStevens looks at Carmen who giggles. He's humiliated by his own temper, attempts to calm himself. Terry puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LOS ANGELES - AERIAL SHOT - DAY \nThe immense sprawl, the arterial flow of the freeways, the blinding light. We DESCEND... \nINT. TRAIN STATION - UNDERGROUND - DAY OR NIGHT \nPeople getting off, among them the former Joe Stevens, now known as JOHN HULL. He's carrying a suitcase. \nINT. TRAIN STATION/EXT. STREET - DAY \nHull goes up the stairs onto a downtown street. \nEXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY \nSouth L.A. neighborhood. A 13-year-old BLACK YOUTH selling drugs through a car window. Hull walks by. He's at ease, looking around, his manner subtly announcing that he belongs here, just as in the train station he seemed to belong among the commuters. \nEXT. TRANSIENT MOTEL - COURTYARD - DAY \nA fat BLONDE WOMAN (61, large white glasses, tiny shoes) leads Hull down a corridor. \nBLONDE WOMAN Television mostly. I was on \"Sky King\" twice, \"Ramar of the Jungle.\" That was a silly show. The jungle was mostly flats... \nThey pass an open door where a 6-year-old boy, JAMES, a latchkey, sits on the stoop playing Gameboy; inside, his mother, BELINDA, a broken down whore, is doing her nails and drinking Pepsi. She looks up, bats her lashes at Hull. \nBLONDE WOMAN (continuing) You want my advice, I'd stay away from that bitch. \nShe opens the door to the room across the hall. A dump. Hull walks in, drops his duffle: he'll take it. The Blonde lounges in the doorway. He closes the door. \nINT. ROOM - DAY \nHull empties his pockets on the dresser. Looks at his money, room key, identification. Looks at himself in the mirror. He touches his clothes, his face, tries on different expressions. \n(NOTE: Throughout the film, Hull continually checks himself out in mirrors, both to adjust his appearance to the circumstances and as if in an attempt to recall who he \"really\" is.) \nEXT. 79TH AND FIGUEROA - TWILIGHT \nOn the seam between South-Central and USC. Lots of people out: children, students, dealers, whores. Hull with a new haircut. \nEXT. ANOTHER, SIMILAR CORNER - DAY \nDealers (most in mid-teens) meeting cars, making transactions. All this casually observed. EDDIE comes up the street, reciting his version of an old street toast. \nEDDIE On the day of the King's castration, all the counts and no accounts were down on the deck with Georgia Tech taking turns in the back seat... \nThose dealers not at car windows, gather around. He never speaks to them, goes on declaiming as he exchanges drugs for money. \nHull watches, talking to another street person. His appearance continues to change: clothes, posture, walk, gestures subtly conform to the environment, a bit like Zelig. Throughout the film his appearance shifts, depending on who he's with. We always recognize him, but each time he's different. \nHe walks up to a dealer, makes a quick buy and keeps going. But he sees them and is seen. \nINT. AN OFFICE - NIGHT \nHull drops eleven foil balls on a green blotter. Carver counts out money for him. \nINT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nHe sits at the window, eating a burrito, watching little James play in the courtyard. \nEXT. STREET - EVENING \nHull approaches another Dealer, the 13-year-old seen earlier (angelic face). Like Hull, he's trying to act tough. \nHULL Whatta you got? \n13-YEAR-OLD DEALER (voice just changing) Nickel rock, dime rock. Excellent shit. \nHull exchanges a folded twenty for two foil balls. He walks off. He has gone twenty feet when... \nRED RANGE ROVER \nHULL There was also a woman, but she's not here. (as Carver reaches in a drawer) I saw a kid killed. Twelve, thirteen at the most. Turf war. \nCarver shrugs: these things happen. He hands Hull a lot of cash, much more than expected. Hull does understand. \nCARVER Get to Elias. Then to Barbosa. \nHULL You can't rush this stuff. \nCARVER Rush it, please. I want art, John, not reality. Budget hearings start in April, and I need Gallegos by then. They won't give us funding for three ounce buys. \nHULL We're not just doing this for the funding, are we? \nCARVER Without funding, we aren't doing it at all. \nTITLE: TWO WEEKS LATER \nINT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY \nVirtual darkness save splinters of light between the curtains. Pipes burn here and there in the gloom. Ten or fifteen crackheads huddle around a battery-operated TV on which Tom Brokaw is narrating an NBC documentary on drugs. A 12-year- old sits against a wall too stoned even for television. \nHull approaches Eddie, regally installed on an automobile bench seat-cum-sofa, a lit pipe in one hand. We barely notice the redhead kneeling between his legs, face buried in his crotch. He greets Hull from wrecked bliss. They know each other now. \nEDDIE My man, Dudley, he's so fud-ley... \nHull greets Eddie, some of the others, drops familiarly onto an adjacent auto seat. The patrons are making fun of Brokaw, laughing, exchanging fives. \nHULL Eddie, man, I need... \nEddie holds up a hand telling Hull to wait. His mind is elsewhere. His features contract in brief concentration. \nCHORUS OF COMMENTS Whatever happened to that Drug Czar motherfucker?... He gave up 'cause he finally realized he didn't know nothing about any of that shit... \nMore laughter, etc. Eddie's concentration peaks, breaks off into a sigh and a smile. \nEddie sings a satisfied little song... \nThe redhead rises from Eddie's crotch, and we see it's a boy, seventeen going on death; he might have been pretty a year ago. \nEddie passes him the crack pipe, lets him suck greedily for a few seconds before ripping it out of his scabrous mouth and offering it to Hull, who, with a grimace that gets laughs, declines. The others continue to watch and comment on the speech. \nEDDIE So what is it you need so bad, blood? Need, need, need?? \nHULL A whole K, quick as you can get it. \nEDDIE (impressed, a trace of envy) Comin' in the world, Dudley. \nHULL (winning grin) All because of my man... \nEddie likes that, holds out a hand. Hull hits it. \nEDDIE Give me a day. \nHull nods, rises. \nEDDIE (continuing) Stick around, let the bitch Hoover you, too. \nIndicating redhead. \nIn all these scenes, Hull acts indifferent to the horror, but here the effort costs him. He masters his disgust with a joke. \nHULL Only if you Clorox him first. \nEveryone laughs, even the boy. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nEddie comes out the back door of a building, is immediately collared by Taft (the cop on the videotape). He's in his mid- 40s, stocky, balding. \nTAFT (cheerful, gregarious) Eddie Shitface! Where you been, boy? \nEddie breaks free, runs three feet before HERNANDEZ (a muscular Mexican) knees him in the groin. Eddie crumples. \nTAFT (continuing) Eddie, I don't think I introduced you to my new partner, Michael Hernandez... \nHERNANDEZ Pleased to meet you, Mr. Shitface... \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nELIAS (continuing) Nancy, get out of here. \nNANCY For you; it's Eddie. \nShe hands him a cordless phone, goes inside closing the door. \nBARBOSA You got a tasty wife, David. No wonder you don't want us coming here. \nELIAS (warning him) Don't talk about her that way. \nBarbosa laughs. \nGOPHER He can't help it, David, it's his nature. \nELIAS (into phone, chipper) Eddie... Sure, man, what do you need? \nINT. A BOXING GYM - NIGHT \nElias joins Eddie and Hull to one side. In the b.g. two guys sparring. \nEDDIE David, this is John, John, David. Eddie, this is Eddie. Everybody ready? \nHULL (to Elias) So what's this, you want to meet me? \nELIAS (charming, touch of mockery) I like to know the important customers. \nHull makes a show of weary patience, gestures: here I am. \nELIAS (continuing) You're taking a lot of weight for a guy we hardly know. Where're you moving this stuff, John? We haven't seen you around. We like to have a sense who your customers are. \nHULL Ah, come on, man, do Macy's tell the Gimbel motherfuckers? \nELIAS (beat; watches him) Eddie, forget this guy, he's a cop. \nHe gets up, walks away. \nON HULL \nHe's blown it. He's been made. The crushing failure. He rallies himself to indignation. \nHULL What is this shit, Eddie? I thought you were the man. \nEddie's sickened, wants to get paid, owes Taft a bust. \nEDDIE Nobody's the fuckin' man. Go to your place. I'll call you. \nEXT. GYM/INT. A VAN - CONTINUOUS TIME \nTaft and Hernandez, watching the gym. Hull comes out, looks up and down the street carefully. Taft sits up, pays attention. \nTAFT This is our collar? \nHernandez grunts. \nTAFT (continuing) Who is he? \nHERNANDEZ Some scumbag... \nBut Taft clearly thinks there's something different about Hull. He's not sure what, but it troubles him. (NOTE: Hull makes a little move that Taft will later realize was a cop's move. For now he can't quite place it.) \nEXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS TIME \nEddie pleading his case to Elias. \nEDDIE He's no cop, David. He's an animal. You see his eyes? You never see a cop with those eyes. I know this shit, man, you don't. \nELIAS (giving him an opening) What's going on, Eddie? \nEDDIE Twenty-six thousand cash is what. We need it, David. We're behind. \nElias studies Eddie: is he a rat? Elias hopes not, but he's going to find out. He hands a fat Federal Express envelope through the window. \nELIAS (a warning) I want him to get it all, Eddie. \nEddie bows in gratitude, hurries off. \nEXT./INT. HULL'S MOTEL - NIGHT \nrunning. Police and SIRENS pursuing. He hurls the Fed Ex envelope into a dumpster. HELICOPTER light sweeps over him. \nAs he cuts around a building, Taft opens a car door right into his face. Hull goes down hard. \nTAFT (into car radio) Thank you kindly... \nHe waves at the helicopter which goes away, kneels over Hull who is twitching spastically on the ground, gasping for air. Hernandez arrives carrying the Fed Ex envelope. \nTAFT (continuing) How you doin', child?... \nHull is astonished to look up and see Taft looming over him, the man he remembers from the videotape. He tries to speak: \nHULL (barely audible) You... \nTAFT (briefly puzzled) Me? Of course, it's me. You know me? \nHull shakes head, winces. \nTAFT (continuing) Hurts, huh? \nHull tries to curse. \nTAFT (continuing) Here, I want to show you something. You have kids? \nHe takes out his wallet, opens it to pictures of his two children, a boy and a girl, seven and eight. \nTAFT (continuing) These are mine. Aren't they the most beautiful children you ever saw? \nHull groans, twists in pain. Taft sticks the pictures in his face. Hull is affected by the children despite everything. \nTAFT (continuing) Yeah, I know, they kind of leave you speechless. So let me ask, if someone put a gun to your baby's head, wouldn't you kill him if you could? \nHull just looks up. \nTAFT (continuing) Me, too. And you're the bastard with the gun. \nHe takes the Fed Ex envelope from him. \nHULL (hoarse; his first words) You know the difference between a nigger and a black man? \nTAFT Don't jive me, boy. \nHULL The nigger's the one covers Whitey's ass by puttin' the brothers in jail. \nTaft yanks him hard to his feet; Hull cries out in pain. \nTAFT You ain't my brother. \nINT. COURTROOM - NIGHT \nHull is led in with other handcuffed PRISONERS. Carver is here, catches Hull's eye. Hull shakes his head; doesn't want Carver to intercede. A woman PUBLIC DEFENDER (26, attractive, harried) addresses the prisoners. \nPUBLIC DEFENDER Hi, I'm Shelley Weissbrod. This is only an arraignment, a preliminary hearing, but if you don't have money for an attorney, the Public Defender's office can... \nHull is listening to this when a BAILIFF taps his shoulder. \nBAILIFF You've got counsel. Over there. \nPuzzled, Hull sees the back of a suit conferring with a PROSECUTOR. The suit turns. It's DAVID ELIAS who smiles, offers his hand. Hull is stunned. Elias enjoys that. \nHULL You're a lawyer?? \nELIAS I'm your lawyer. \nHULL Who hired you? \nELIAS (smiles) It's pro bono. If you don't want me, there's Shelley. She's good. She just can't provide special services... \nHULL Like what? \nVOICE (O.S.) (calling the next case) John Hull... \nELIAS Getting your case called first. \nElias addressing the court. \nELIAS (continuing) Your Honor, I believe the preliminary police toxicology report will show that the substance seized from my client was Mannitol, a baby laxative. We move for immediate dismissal. \nEDDIE I don't have it right now. But I can -- \nGOPHER (sadly) Then goodbye, Eddie. I forgive you for what you said to me. \nEDDIE (pleading) Twelve hours. Tomorrow morning. \nBARBOSA Six... seven... (to Elias) You want to do it, David? \nElias looks stricken. Barbosa laughs. Eddie jumps up. Hull turns away, can't bear to watch this. \nBARBOSA (continuing) Nine... \nEDDIE \ngrabs the first thing he lays eyes on, a tiny snail fork and plunges it into Barbosa's neck. \nAs if it were a fly bite, Barbosa flings the table aside and, with a long knife already in his hand, guts Eddie from groin to breast bone. Eddie falls like a suddenly emptied sack. \nElias can't help gasping. \nHull looks away, hiding his horror. \nBarbosa rips the fork out of his neck and hurls it at the body. \nBARBOSA Piece of shit! \nElias stares at Eddie's body, transfixed. Horrified, fascinated, afraid, in awe. Barbosa turns to Hull. \nBARBOSA (continuing) What'd you think? \nHULL At least it was clean. \nBARBOSA (pleased, to Elias) What about you, bar mitzvah body? First time you saw somebody die? \nELIAS (eyes fixed on the body) No. (catching breath) At camp... when I was fourteen... a friend of mine was water skiing... The motorboat ran him over... A junior counsellor was driving. \nBARBOSA You should kill a man some day, David, it's liberating... (walking out) Summer camp. I'm in business with somebody who went to summer camp. \nEveryone else is silent, grave. \nINT. ELIAS'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - EARLY MORNING \nThrough sliders we see a small pool. Elias and Hull sit over uneaten omelets. Both still shaken by the previous scene. \nELIAS Eddie, man... He was always nice to my daughter. \nHULL How'd a guy like you get into this? \nELIAS The way most drug lawyers do: clients paid me in product, and I had to move it. Soon I was doing more dealing than law. But this was '83, '84, there was so much money we thought it would never end. \nHULL Yeah. And now...? \nELIAS The road gets rougher. Cocaine's a dying business. \nHULL Then what are we doing here? \nELIAS People are always going to want to get high. Every society has ways to alter consciousness. \nHULL Because they can't bear reality. \nELIAS (smiles) We all need our delusions, only the means change: psychedelics, opiates, prayer, orgies, human sacrifice... \nHULL What's next? \nElias puts a finger to his lips. \nHULL (continuing) Why aren't you selling it? \nELIAS I know how to make it and market it. But I need capital. That's the only reason I'm hanging out with an asshole like Barbosa. (feels his hatred of Barbosa) And because I can't get to the big guys. \nHULL Who are the big guys? \nELIAS Gallegos, et cetera. \nHULL (reacts to the name) Why can't you get to them? \nELIAS What do you care? \nINT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY \nHull doling out vials to DEALERS seen earlier with Eddie. \nHULL (V.O.) I can't do this shit. I just can't. \nEXT. A STREET - DAY \nDEALERS going up to cars as before, only now they're Hull's dealers. A well-dressed Black businessman buys from his BMW. \nCARVER (V.O.) But you want to be of use. You want to get drugs off the street, don't you? \nHULL (V.O.) That's why I'm here. \nEXT. SAME - ANOTHER TIME \nAnother sale: Teenagers on foot. \nCARVER (V.O.) Well, this is the cost. Pay it or go grow flowers someplace. \nEXT. HULL'S MOTEL - ANOTHER TIME \nHe comes out of the motel talking to a Dealer we've seen above. \nHULL You can't back down with them. You've got to project strength, from inside, you know? \nThe Dealer nods. Across the street Hull sees: \nA blue sedan. Taft and Hernandez. Taft gives Hull a little nod and grin. \nEXT. STREET - ANOTHER TIME \nHull sitting in an aging Trans Am, making entries in a notebook. Across the street he watches: \nA PREGNANT WOMAN (19), a squawling baby in arms, buying from one of his Dealers. \nHe kicks the dash in frustrated anger. Under the MUSIC: \nHULL Cocksucker... \nAs soon as the woman's gone. He goes over to the Dealer, slaps his head, slaps it again. Under the MUSIC: \nDEALER (hurt, confused) What'd you do that for? \nHULL (walking off) 'Cause I can, motherfucker, 'cause I can. \nEXT. SAME - ANOTHER TIME \nA white housewife making a buy from a new mini-van, a baby in the car seat. \nEXT. STREET - TWILIGHT \nTwo USC football players (letter jackets, huge) hassling BIJOUX, a woman dealer, pushing her, she pushes back, curses. \nSuddenly Hull comes running up, shoves them apart. He's yelling, pointing a finger in their faces. Elias comes up behind, calmer. \nHull is smaller than either USC kid, but they back down as he curses them. Under MUSIC: \nHULL ...Touch her again, motherfuckers, I'm gonna mess you up. \nA brief scuffle. Hull decks one USC, and Elias pulls him off. The kids leave. Elias doubles over with laughter. Hull yells at Bijoux and walks off. \nEXT. APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY \nHull (looking at written address) knocks on a door. It's opened by a beautiful, dark-skinned black woman in a skimpy robe. She looks at him with disarming frankness. He thinks he must be in the wrong place. \nHULL Is David Elias here? \nELIAS (O.S.) Momentito... \nThrough the door we see him emerge from a bedroom stepping into his loafers, buttoning his shirt. He gives the woman along, dark kiss, caressing her body. \nELIAS Jacqueline, ho-ney... \nShe laughs, closes the door. As he and Hull walk to the street, Elias sings happily to himself: \nELIAS (continuing) \"Who's making love to your old lady... while you're out make love...?\" (cheerful) How come I like balling black chicks so much? \nBetty ignores him, does her lines. \nMCCUTCHEON (taunting Hull) Oooh... Cocaine, I love it and I hate it and I love it. The disease is the cure. \nShe can't help looking at Hull who's looking at her. She and Elias are stoned; he's not. \nMCCUTCHEON (continuing) Don't look at me. Elias, tell him not to look at me. I don't like the fucker. \nBut Elias is too busy vacuuming up Hull's leftovers. \nELIAS (sniffling) John's an ascetic Negro; he wants to make sure you know he's not a jungle bunny. \nHULL Watch your mouth, David. \nELIAS But he's got another side. You should seen him on the street the other day with these two USC kids. Do the spade bit for her, John. (black accent) I'm gonna mess you up, muthafugga... \nHe sticks his finger in Hull's face just like Hull with the boys. \nHULL Don't call me a spade. And don't tell me to play black. \nHe says it gently, but Betty hears the edge. \nELIAS (hurt, disappointed) Come on, John, you do it so well. (falling into it) Ah ain't playin', muthafucka. Ah ain't playin'. \nHull glares; Elias refuses to be intimidated. \nELIAS (continuing) Don't fuckin' dis me, muthafucka. Fucka... fucka... fucka a... fucka b... fuck b-hive... fucka, fucka, fucka... \nElias dances around repeating \"fucka\" until it's almost musical. \nHull picks him up and slams into a wall. \nHULL Say it again, and I'll kill you. \nElias throws Hull back against a display case. He's strong and unafraid. They're ready to fight. \nMCCUTCHEON Grow up, assholes! \nThis half snaps them out of it. Still glowering, they slowly relax, release each other. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nHull sits in the Trans Am eating a sandwich and watching the street as a DEALER leans in the window telling his sob story. There's an authority to Hull's manner that tells us he may not like this job, but he knows how to do it. \nDEALER ...The guy ripped me off, man, so I don't got the money, I don't got the stuff and -- \nHULL (eyes on street) You gotta pay anyway. \nDEALER Oh, but, man... \nAs he raps on, comical pathos, Hull spots in his side mirror... \nTHE RED RANGE ROVER \ncoming slowly this way. Ivy in the passenger window, the barrel of an automatic weapon glinting in the streetlight. \nHULL Shit... \nHull glances up: Bijoux is selling on the next corner. \nThe Range Rover passes the Trans Am. Ivy leans out. \nHull flings open the Trans Am door, throwing the Dealer to the ground. He jumps from the car: \nHULL (continuing) Bijoux!! \nShe turns. Sees Ivy. She puts out her hands to block the shots. The SOUND of the gun is inaudible. The barrel bounces slightly. Bijoux sprawls backward. \nBijoux: dead on the sidewalk, limbs askew, bleeding from many wounds. \nHull, standing over her, covers her face. \nEXT. SAME - MUCH LATER THAT NIGHT \nThe body has been taken away, the crowd has cleared. Elias sits on the hood of the Trans Am. Hull stands, staring down. \nELIAS It wasn't your fault. (no response) What could you have done? \nHULL He supplies Barbosa. To get to him we'll have to take quantity. \nCARVER Then you've got to -- \nHULL That's what killing Ivy did. I'll get to him soon. \nCarver's impressed. \nHULL (continuing) Is that it? \nCARVER (seeing him to the door) I want you to get a new apartment. Something expensive. \nHULL I like where I am. \nCARVER That shithole? You're big time now. Act it. And get some clothes. Spend money. Have fun. That's an order. \nINT. HULL'S MOTEL - OFFICE - DAY \nHull in a new, expensive suit, gives the big Blonde Woman cash. \nHULL Whether I'm here or not, no one else uses that room. And change the linen twice a week, just like now. (starts to go, stops, more money) And make sure James gets what he needs. And something for you. \nHe adds another bill. She smiles. \nINT. A RENTED CONDOMINIUM - DAY \nViews, open space, expensive furnishings. Hull (in another fancy suit) is hanging a couple of Betty's masks. He's meticulous about their placement. \nElias wanders out from the other rooms, looking around. \nELIAS (impressed, envious) Nice place. Nice suit. \nHull has a moment of self-consciousness about the suit, checks himself out in a mirror -- a private moment. \nElias flops on a couch, puts his feet on an antique coffee table. \nHULL Hey...! \nHe hurries over, lifts Elias feet to the floor. Hull brushes the wood, inspects it carefully, fusses, worries... Elias is amused. \nELIAS You pick all this shit out yourself? \nHULL A Jewish lady in the store helped me. \nELIAS (mock touched by racial harmony) Aw... Very nice. Understated. I'm impressed. \nHull starts to place stacks of cash in a briefcase. He's momentarily mesmerized by all the money. \nHULL (to himself) Fifty bucks, fifty fucking bucks... \nELIAS You sold it all? \nHull nods. \nELIAS (continuing) I'll order a couple more keys from Barbosa. \nHULL Order ten. \nELIAS Ten?? \nHULL Better twenty. \nELIAS (afraid of that) I don't want to push it. \nHULL I do. We've got a bigger territory, we need more product. I want to deal directly with Gallegos. It would save us money. \nELIAS Barbosa'll never let us near him. \nHull closes the briefcase, ushers Elias toward the door. He's going out, too. \nHULL If we buy twenty, Gallegos'll come to us himself. \nELIAS How do you know? \nHULL When I bought a key from Eddie, you came to me. \nElias laughs, surprised, afraid. \nINT. CLUB - NIGHT \nKids dancing to a live STAGE ACT. High in a wall: a lit window. \nINT. THAT ROOM - NIGHT \nVery different from the club. A comfortable room with a bar, tables, filled with men much older than the dancers below. Barbosa and Gopher at the bar with Elias and Hull. Chino and other SHADOWY FIGURES lurk in the room's depths. \nBARBOSA Ten kilos? You're always late on two. \nHULL Not ten... twenty. \nBarbosa's impressed. \nHULL (continuing) The more we have, the more we can move. There're markets we can't open because we don't have the inventory. \nBarbosa's coked to the eyeballs, mean and dangerous. \nBARBOSA Finally some balls on this team... (taunting Elias) Come work for me, John. I'll give you your own franchise. You can supply Elias, lean on him when he's late. \nELIAS Go fuck yourself. \nBarbosa laughs. \nHULL I'm with David. \nBARBOSA Why? He give you his \"designer drugs\" pitch. He's never going to do it. He's a shmuck. \nELIAS Don't talk to me that way. \nBARBOSA I'm not talking to you at all. I'm talking to John. \nGOPHER It's the cocaine. Don't listen to him. Felix, you've had enough... \nBARBOSA Shmuck. \nElias goes for him. He's fast and strong, and it takes Chino and Hull to pull him off. \nGOPHER Praise God they don't let guns in here. \nCALMING VOICES \"None of that in here...\" \"Take it outside...\" \nBarbosa's laughing, but his cheek is flecked with his own blood, and his eyes are dead. \nBARBOSA David, you've been working out, you're getting strong. Are you quick, too? (shadow boxes) Come on, I'll give you a shot at me. \nELIAS Any time, any place. \nBARBOSA Right here, right now. Do this. \nHe puts his hands out, palms up. \nELIAS This? What is this? \nBARBOSA You know, you slap me, I slap you. (mimes that game) Come on, it's fun. Like summer camp. \nIt doesn't look fun. Elias glances at Hull for guidance. \nHULL Don't waste your time. \nBARBOSA Stay out of this. (to Elias) Come on, you can do it, David, you're not a shmuck. \nElias puts his hands out, palms up. Barbosa covers them with his own. ON THE HANDS: Barbosa's broad, muscular with thick gold rings and a Rolex; Elias's paler, slighter, a wedding band and a slim watch. \nBARBOSA (continuing) Slap my hands. Just slap them. \nElias looks Barbosa in the eye. He's trying to be a snake, but he's more the mouse. He looks away and as he does tries to... \nSlap him with both hands but hits only... \nAir. The room breathes. Barbosa turns his rings so the big surfaces point down. \nBARBOSA (continuing) Now it's my turn. \nGOPHER It's Barbosa's turn. He's gonna kill the white boy. \nELIAS One more. \nBARBOSA Shut up. \nINT. BOXING GYM - NIGHT \nBarbosa, Gopher with Hernandez, Taft's partner. Now we know Hernandez is corrupt: that's how they knew Eddie was talking. \nBARBOSA I got nothing to give you, my man. I'm an il-liquid son of a bitch. \nHERNANDEZ Felix, I keep telling them, \"I have informants down there, I'm working guys, I can't say who...\" If you don't have money, give me busts, or they're gonna start wondering about me. \nGOPHER They're already wondering. \nBARBOSA (deadpan) You can have Gopher. \nGOPHER Oh Gawd... \nBARBOSA How about a lawyer? \nGOPHER (knows who he means) Felix, don't do this. \nHERNANDEZ (he knows, too) Great, lawyers are great, Jewish is best. But I need spades, too. The politicians want dark facts to scare the suburbs so they'll vote Republican. \nBARBOSA Lawyers and spades; I got the trifecta: two dealers and a girl who does their wash. Two niggers and a kike; all Democrats. \nHERNANDEZ You're my man. And afterwards... \nHernandez rubs thumb against fingers. \nBARBOSA When this is over, I'll send you to Hawaii, Maui. It's very beautiful in Maui, it's a very spiritual place. \nHERNANDEZ I just want money. \nAnd he's gone. \nGOPHER I wouldn't trust that man when he's out of rifle range. \nBarbosa looks tired. \nGOPHER (continuing; premonition of disaster) Don't do this, Felix. It'll go wrong. Kill Elias if you have to, honey, but don't set him up for this. It damages your prestige. \nBarbosa faces his cocaine. He tries to resist the pull, then yields. He does another line. It's his friend. He loves it. He picks up a cellular phone, dials. \nBARBOSA David, you're awake, I'm impressed... I'm sorry about what happened... Listen, I'll get you twenty boxes, like you wanted. You were right, you should have what you need... Tomorrow night... Bring your partner and that girl with the store, Betty... I need her advice on something. I want us to have fun, like we used to. We'll go to that shrimp place, okay?... Good... Me, too, David. (hangs up; does another line; drawing it deep into him) Yes! \nINT. CARVER'S OFFICE - BEFORE DAWN \nHull jacked up, excited, pleased with himself. As he paces, Carver observes his beautiful suit, shoes, expensive watch. He looks much better than Carver. \nHULL We're getting twenty kilograms tomorrow. (notes the lightening sky) Tonight. I made it happen. I pushed Elias, now he doesn't make a move without me. \nCARVER You run Elias. \nHULL I control him. Barbosa's selling it to us because he thinks I can move it... (now the big news) And last night I met Ramon Gallegos. \nCarver sits up fast. Hull likes that. \nHULL (continuing) We're getting the dope from him; it's still coming through Barbosa, but Gallegos will approach me soon on his own. We're going to get him, Gerry. We're going to bring him and the whole thing down. \nCarver sits back, grimaces. \nHULL (continuing) What's your problem? \nCARVER (looking out window) My problem? My problem is that you don't really know what's happening. \nHULL (sardonic) Oh, so, tell me what's happening, Gerry. \nCARVER Barbosa is setting you up tonight. \nHULL Bullshit. \nCARVER He's dealing you to Taft and Hernandez. You're going to be taken down as you receive the drugs. They're putting together the arrest team right now. \nThat rocks Hull. He is up, pacing. \nHULL What do we do? \nCARVER You stay away. We're going to take them down. \nElias, energized by Hull's command, grabs Barbosa and throws him toward the limo. \nHERNANDEZ'S POV THROUGH NIGHT SCOPE \nTAFT We have a problem. \nHERNANDEZ Shit! Shit! Shit! (aiming rifle; Hull in sights) Enough of this... \nTAFT No! \nEXT. TWO CARS - NIGHT \nHull shepherding everyone into the limo. He glances toward the van. On instinct. He pulls Chino to him. \nA RIFLE SHOT \nChino's head explodes. Betty screams. \nBARBOSA (screaming at van) Don't shoot... Don't shoot... \nINT. VAN - NIGHT \nTaft hurling Hernandez against the wall. \nTAFT Goddam it, what the hell are you doing? \nEXT. TWO CARS - NIGHT \nSIRENS. GUNFIRE. Elias drags Barbosa into the limo. Hull throws Betty into the front seat. The limo takes off. \nEXT. STREET/INT. LIMO - DRIVING - NIGHT \nHull driving, Betty up front. Elias with a gun on Barbosa in back. Hull slaloms the limo through police GUNFIRE. Windows are blown out. Glass everywhere. \nMCCUTCHEON (weeping) I asked for this... I asked for it... It's my fault... \nHULL (calm, eyes on road) Relax. We'll make it. \nShe looks at him, stunned yet soothed by his certainty. \nBARBOSA He's a cop. He has to be. How else would he have known? \nHULL If I was cop, you'd be face down back there. \nMCCUTCHEON How did you know? \nHULL The whole thing smelled. Changing his mind about the stuff. Meeting us way out here. And I'd seen cops in that van before. Hernandez is dirty, that's who he's using. \nELIAS (to Barbosa) Get out of the car. \nHe starts to open the door. \nHULL David, not now. \nELIAS Yes, now! \nINT. TAFT AND HERNANDEZ'S CAR - NIGHT \nRacing. Taft at wheel, raging at Hernandez. \nTAFT Who are you, man? Who the fuck are you? \nHERNANDEZ (stonewalling) I'm me. \nINT. LIMO - DRIVING - NIGHT \nELIAS He traded us to the cops. Just like Eddie. Eddie, who was nice to my daughter, had to die because that's the rule. And you were vulgar about my wife, Felix, so at the very least the same rule applies to you. \nBARBOSA I'll give you money. I'll give you a million. Anything you want. \nELIAS I want you to get out of the car. Get out of the fucking car. Out of the fucking -- \nMCCUTCHEON (near tears) No, no... we can't do this. \nHULL (turning around from front seat) Stop it, David, or we're... \nElias wheels on him, sticks the gun in his face: \nMCCUTCHEON Of course, you can. \nHULL (almost angry) No! This is what I'm supposed to do. \nMCCUTCHEON Supposed to? Who said you're supposed to? \nHULL The whole fuckin' world. You think I didn't try something else? But everything funnels you right back here. Like it's where you had to go all along. \nMCCUTCHEON But you know what you're doing, don't you, selling this stuff? Doing to our own. \nHULL If I tried to get out now, they'd kill me. \nMCCUTCHEON (tortured) I can't be with somebody's who involved in drugs. \nHe nods. He knows. He's even happy about it. But she won't yield. Finally he gets up and walks back out the door. \nEXT. GOPHER'S BUILDING - 4 A.M. \nThe neighborhood is reminiscent of the one where Joe Stevens Sr. was killed. The rap club still pumps MUSIC onto the 4 A.M. streets where whores, junkies, children, teenagers with beepers and Nikes, welfare mothers roam as if it were daytime anywhere else. Their eyes, yearning, sullen, vital, hopeless and hoping stare at... \nHULL \nEveryone knows what he is: the Black Man with the Big Car. They don't remember when he was just another hustler making street buys. Now they hate him, revere him, want to be him, not caring what it entails. Every eye follows as... \nHe and Elias cross the street toward Gopher's door. Hull's eyes don't go right or left. He's a driven man now. \nINT. GOPHER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nGopher has just been roused from sleep. A light in his face, Hull and Elias looming over him. \nHULL There've got to be more. We have a million two, we owe Gallegos one eight. \nGOPHER I told you everyone. Everyone who owed him, everyone he... One eight? He's lying. Barbosa barely owed him a million. \nHull and Elias look at each other. \nINT. BETTY'S STORE - MORNING \nTaft is showing her photocopies of phone bills, bank transactions, invoices. She's obviously upset. \nTAFT I got every money transfer, every phone call, all your laundry tickets. \nMCCUTCHEON (miserable) What do you want? \nTAFT John Hull. \nMCCUTCHEON I can't! \nTAFT Or you'll go away 'til you're a dried up old woman, and when you come out, ain't nobody gonna want you. \nShe covers her face. \nEXT. EAST L.A. STREET/INT. CAR - DAY \nElias driving a car we haven't seen before and snickering to himself at some private joke. \nHULL What are you laughing at? \nElias shakes his head: nothing. He laughs. They pull into the lot beside a movie theater. \nINT. THEATER - DAY \nA Technicolor Spanish melodrama is winding to its lurid end. A door in back opens, and a burst of daylight reveals Hull and Elias being brought in by a guard and met by Molto. \nMolto and the guard frisk them, take their guns and money satchels, make them wait a moment until... \nThe movie ends. \nThe house lights come on revealing Ramon Gallegos as the only spectator in the theater. He beckons. Molto and the guard bring Hull and Elias down the aisle to him. \nGallegos looking in the satchels. A tense moment. \nHULL It isn't one eight. (off Gallegos) It's a million one. That's all Barbosa owed, it's all we're paying. \nGallegos is stern for a moment, then laughs. \nGALLEGOS Big brass balls. Collecting money makes you strong. \nSAME - LATER \nMolto tied to a tree. Elias is giving him instructions while, strangely, removing Molto's shoes and socks. \nELIAS (to Molto) Disce a Senor Guzman que... (his Spanish isn't good enough) ...that we have his money, and we're willing to talk as soon as he comes to town. We'll know how to reach him. Okay? \nMolto just glares at him. Elias smiles, takes the shoes and socks and all the contents of Molto's into the Winnebago, and he and Hull drive away, leaving the car behind. \nEXT./INT. A PARKING GARAGE/INT. WINNEBAGO - EVENING \nThe Winnebago enters the garage, Elias greeting the attendant, \"Hey, Frank.\" Frank waves him in. \nThe garage is filled with various RVs. Hull pulls the Winnebago into an empty spot beside Elias's car and gets out. Elias remains in the cabin making calculations. \nELIAS Approximating the cubic capacity and depending on the denominations of the bills, it's somewhere between fifty million and two hundred million dollars. Right back there. \nAs he does, Hull checks his gun, walks around behind the vehicle and prepares to shoot Elias in the back of the head through the open window. Elias finishes his money report, and sits there as if unaware of Hull, but: \nELIAS (continuing; not turning around) Think I'm crazy? \nHULL Yes. (blowing up, gun still on him) I can't believe you got us into this. All of fucking Latin America is going to be after our asses, including Renaldo Guzman who's friends with fucking George Bush. \nELIAS I know they're coming after us. I want them to. We'll give them the money, but we'll make a deal for ourselves. We'll get what we need for the synthetic drugs. I've thought it all out. I've been thinking it out for years. \nHull uncocks the gun, rubs it against his burning face. Elias turns around, embraces him. \nELIAS (continuing) We're going to have everything. Don't you want everything, John? \nHULL They're going to get your family, David. They'll kill your wife and daughter. \nELIAS (serene) Nancy and Miranda left the country two days ago. \nHULL You knew about this then? \nElias smiles. \nHULL (continuing) What about Betty? \nEXT. BETTY'S JEWELRY SHOP - EVENING \nA car SQUEALS to a stop. Molto and three thugs smash through the glass door. They disappear into the store where things can be heard BREAKING. They emerge a moment later, jump into the car. \nEXT. SYNAGOGUE - EVENING \nHull's car races up. He jumps out, dashes toward the building. \nINT. SYNAGOGUE SOCIAL HALL - EVENING \nForty PEOPLE on folding chairs. Hull enters on a dead run. He stops short when he sees: \nBETTY \nat the front. He signals to her, but she's already saying: \nMCCUTCHEON Hi, my name is Betty. \nEVERYONE IN THE ROOM Hi, Betty! \nMCCUTCHEON My name is Betty, I'm a drug addict. And I've been clean for nineteen days. \nThe room bursts into APPLAUSE. She sees Hull at the back; he signals to her, but she goes on. \nMCCUTCHEON (continuing) I've been using drugs and selling them, and I've wanted to stop for a long time, and the only way I did was because I met a man I loved and who loved me. I know that's not what I'm supposed to say. I'm supposed to say there was a higher power, and maybe there was, behind it all, but this man is strong and his love made me strong enough that I could start, or at least think about a life that didn't have drugs in it... \nShe's looking right at Hull as she speaks. He's torn between the danger he knows she's in and his emotion at what she's saying. \nEXT. SYNAGOGUE - EVENING \nHull hurrying Betty toward his car. She's protesting. \nMCCUTCHEON I've got to get clothes. \nHULL You can't go back. \nINT. HULL'S CONDO - EVENING \nMolto and men pouring through it. In frustration, Molto smashes the table Hull had fussed over when Elias put his feet up. \nHe empties his pockets of all that gushed out of the Winnebago, empties a satchel as well until it fills the room like snow. \nEXT. MOTEL - NIGHT \nHull putting Betty into an airport limousine. \nHULL (to the driver) International terminal. (to Betty) I'll meet you there in a week. \nShe kisses him. He's about to close the door. She stops it. \nMCCUTCHEON You know the first time, when I saw you in the bar...? \nHULL (smiles at the memory) You wouldn't even look at me. \nMCCUTCHEON 'Cause I knew what you were thinking. You were judging me. \nHULL No, I wasn't, I was... \nMCCUTCHEON You were. Your eyes were like an angel in my heart telling me I should be good, and I didn't want to hear it. \nThis news startles Hull, yet, strangely, he senses its truth, and the sweetness is more than he can bear. \nMCCUTCHEON (continuing) That's you, too. Maybe this is you, I don't know, but I know that's you. \nShe closes the door. The car pulls away. \nIn an unmarked car up the street, Taft picks up the radio. \nEXT. A LATIN AMERICAN CONSULATE - DAY \nA limousine pulls into the gate and disgorges RENALDO GUZMAN, 55, and his wife, 25. They're shown into the consulate. \nThe limousine pulls out onto the street and parks. Gopher appears, knocks on the driver's window. It comes down. They chat briefly in Spanish. Gopher opens up a cellular phone. \nINT. A HOTEL ROOM - SANTA MONICA - DAY \nOverlooking the ocean. Hull pacing nervously, Elias relaxed, reading the paper. \nHULL What if we forget all this? Take ten million each and disappear. Leave the country. New identities, new lives... \nELIAS What's the matter, John? Having doubts? \nHULL Yeah. \nA phone RINGS. Elias picks up his own cellular. \nELIAS Yes... Where?... No! No way... We pick the time and place... Otherwise no meet... (looks to Hull who nods his agreement) Got a pencil? \nEXT. CONSULATE - LIMO - DAY \nGopher hands a piece of paper to the limo driver. He walks away... \nAROUND THE CORNER \nAs he's about to get into a car, Taft grabs him. Gopher is surprised and not pleased. \nEXT. PARKING GARAGE - NIGHT \nWhere Hull and Elias left the Winnebago. Guzman's limo approaches. Frank, the attendant, waves it on. \nINT. GARAGE - NIGHT \nThe limo climbs the ramps until it comes to Elias's car, parked where the Winnebago was; the Winnie is nowhere in sight. The limo pulls alongside. \nHull and Elias get out. Molto gets out of the limo. Then Renaldo Guzman. \nELIAS We have a proposal to make. We regret what happened to your nephew... \nGUZMAN Say what you have to say. \nELIAS We all know that your cousin's business is coming to an end. Costs have climbed while profits and the market -- \nGuzman waves: get to the point. \nELIAS (continuing) We have developed a new product: simpler, cheaper to manufacture, superior quality and completely synthetic. Therefore, no growing, no refining, no peasants, no importing, no customs agents... Here's a detailed prospectus with anticipated cash flow and so forth. \nHe hands a copy to Guzman and the lawyer. \nHe drops to his knees. Blood oozes from Taft's chest. \nELIAS John, what the hell are you doing? Let's get out of here. \nHull tries to hold closed the wound. The posture duplicates Hull with his dying father. He feels for a pulse. For breath. \nHULL (distraught) He's dying. \nELIAS Let him die. Let him die twice. Come one. \nHe pulls at Hull who won't go. Hull does mouth-to-mouth. Taft opens his eyes, looks up at him. \nHULL [Says to Taft whatever a CPR-trained policeman would say in this situation.] (to Elias) Get help. \nELIAS Are you kidding me? \nTAFT (to Hull, getting it) Oh, man, you're a cop. You're a cop, aren't you? \nHULL (with difficulty, as if against his will) Yeah, I'm a cop. I'm a fucking cop... \nELIAS (laughs) Oh, really? Where's you badge? \nHULL I don't have one. I'm undercover. Get help, David. \nELIAS John, that's a cop. He tried to kill you. \nHULL He didn't know. \nELIAS Oh, he didn't know. I don't know. Maybe you don't know. Maybe you think you're a cop because... because... \nHULL Drop the gun, put your hands against the car. Spread your legs... Police! \nTaft grunts once, stiffens. \nHULL (continuing) My God! Please... \nThe pulse is gone. Hull begins to perform CPR. \nELIAS Okay, let's say you're a cop. Be a cop. \nHull keeps doing CPR. \nELIAS (continuing) We've still got the money. We put it into Randy's chemistry set. In five years we're worth five hundred million each, minimum. You'll be one of the richest black men in America. Richer than Cosby. Who gives a shit how you got it? You think the white ones were honest? \nHull keeps working on Taft. \nELIAS (continuing) Is this asshole all that stands between you and greatness? Let me do you a favor. \nHe puts a gun to Taft's head and FIRES. In a reflex, Hull draws his own gun, SHOOTS Elias in the stomach. Stunned, he wobbles backward a few steps. Sits on the street. \nELIAS (continuing) Gee, John, that's kind of an extreme reaction. \nHull is stunned he did it. And this finally attracts the police who see a black man with a gun who just shot a white man. \nHull goes to Elias who's dead. A POLICEMAN pulls him off, beating him with a gun. \nPOLICEMAN Fucking nigger... \nINT. LOS ANGELES COUNTY JAIL - DAY \nHull, bandaged, wearing prison blues, walking with Carver. \nHULL What about Guzman? \nCARVER He vanished, thank God, or we'd both be in deep doo-doo. At least you got Gallegos. \nHULL Elias did. And everything goes on as before. \nCARVER That's the drug game. Plus a change... I want you to come back to work for me. You'll beat all charges on a technicality and go back to who you were. \nHULL Who was I, Ger? \nCARVER Does anyone really know? \nHULL I have other things to do. \nCARVER Like travel? Tangiers, maybe? \n", "test1_input": "INT. REAR OF CLUB - A SHORT HALLWAY - NIGHT \nleading toward the rear door they saw from the alley. \nMOVING DOWN THE HALL \nA woman's room. A men's room. Hull goes into... \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nIvy is pissing into a urinal. He's so huge he seems to take up all the space in the tiny room. Hull stares at him, unable to look away. \nHe notices Hull. All dialogue is UNDER the POUNDING MUSIC. \nIVY What're you looking at? \nHull stares at Ivy's face. Ivy considers this rude. \nIVY (continuing) You want to suck it, bitch? (offers his dick) Or drink it? \nLaughing, he turns, urinates on Hull's pants. Hull doesn't move. \nIVY (continuing; recognizing him) Oh, I know you. You're the bitch whose whore I wasted tonight, ain't you? \nSomebody pushes on the outside of the door. Hull holds it closed with his back. \nIVY (continuing) I gotta take care of you, too, huh? \nHe reaches into his pants for the butt of a gun. \nHull is frozen. \nIvy starts to draw it out. \nHull steps forward, grabs Ivy's gun arm. With his other hand he clumsily pulls a silenced .22 from inside his jacket, puts it in the underside of Ivy's jaw and SHOOTS twice. Ivy's brains spray upward onto the wall, and he slides straight to the floor. Hull steps out into... \nINT. SHORT HALL - NIGHT \nAn Hispanic busboy coming out of the kitchen sees him and the gun in his hand, freezes. \nHull walks past him and out the back door. From inside we see Hull go down three steps, stumble in the drive and fall to his knees, the gun CLATTERING away from him. \nA couple that had been making out, stops, looks. \nIt takes Hull a moment to gather himself. He picks up the gun, gets into Elias's car. It drives away. \nINT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nAlone, he looks at his face in the mirror. As if he doesn't know the person there. \nWith a knife, he draws out something hidden inside the wooden backing of the mirror. A manila envelope. He empties it onto the dresser: \nMementos among which we see, carefully preserved, the blood- soaked bills his father gave him. Hull ignores them and picks up... \nPHOTO OF HIS CHILDREN \nHe smooths out the folds, stares at it as if trying to fix this in his thoughts. \nEXT. MOTEL COURTYARD - PAY PHONE - DAY \nHull on the phone. He's unusually excited, even moved. \nHULL ...Carmen, it's me. It's Daddy... \nINT. HULL'S HOUSE - CLEVELAND - DAY \nCarmen on the phone, jumping up and down with excitement. \nCARMEN Daddy!! \nHULL (V.O.) (through phone) Hi, baby. How are you? I miss you! \nCARMEN What? \nHULL (V.O.) I miss you... \nCARMEN (thrilled) I miss you, too, Daddy... \n", "test1_true": "Hull pressing the phone to his face, trying to master his emotions. \nGRAINY 16MM FILM - A LABORATORY MAZE \nA lab rat with a metal electrode protruding from its head, is running a maze at high speed. A VOICE explaining things. \nVOICE (young, nasal, too smart) The maze leads in two directions. At one end the rat can obtain a food pellet. At the other... (pointer indicates each end) ...it receives electrical stimulus to a very specific area of the cerebellum... \nThe rat reaches this second destination, pushes a bar, is stimulated. A lab worker (white coat, gloves) picks up the animal, replaces it at the start. It runs the same route. \nVOICE (continuing) This rat, like 86% of the others in the experiment, chose the electrical stimulus repeatedly and exclusively. It continued to do so until it died of malnutrition. \nANOTHER SHOT -- the rat dead. \nINT. A LABORATORY - DAY OR NIGHT \nA 21-year-old RENEGADE from the Cal Tech chemistry department (red hair, freckles, glasses held together with electrical tape), a brilliant nerd. He picks up... \nA MOLECULAR MODEL \nColored balls stuck together with wooden dowels. \nCAL TECH This is an addictive amphetamine with time-space distortion, delusions of grandeur -- or maybe they're real -- tending to be impulsive, sometimes violent behavior. Psychotropic adaptation for late monopoly capitalism. It's illegal, and you can buy it on any street corner. \nHe tears off some of the balls, sticks on new ones. \nCAL TECH (continuing) This increases energy, attention, cognitive powers, yet with a smooth, almost opiate-like emotional surface. Ideal for the post-political, post- rationalist global marketplace and 24 hour lifestyles. It's completely legal and can only get it here, in my lab. \nELIAS (to Hull, proudly) Randy's a genius. His professor told him he could win the Nobel prize. \nCAL TECH Nobel prizes are for wussies. \nHULL What does this shit do to you? \nCAL TECH I'm on it now. It's like cocaine only better. (offers him powder on a slide) Want some? \nHULL I don't take drugs. \nCAL TECH (unoffended) Your mistake. This is designed for the top end of the market. For people who want to master reality, not avoid it. Because it's synthetic, you don't grow it, refine it, or -- best of all -- import it. \nELIAS What would it take to manufacture this stuff in quantity? \nCAL TECH With a million dollars, I could produce enough for a limited market at about two bucks a pop. (makes a face: fair) But then with five million, or better yet ten, the cost would drop to thirty cents, and we'd have enough for the whole world. \nELIAS I'm going to put two hundred fifty thousand into your corporate account. You cheat me, Randy, I'll use your bladder for a bagpipe. (to Hull, with a vengeance) We're going to put Barbosa out of business. \nElias is very happy. He leads Hull out. \nINT. CARVER'S OFFICE - DAY \nOn the pyramid chart there's a black border around Ivy's photo, as around Eddie's. A photo of Hull is now on the board beside the one of Elias. Hull stares out the window, lost in thought. \nCARVER (dismissive) Synthetic shit?? Sounds like a 20/20 segment... \nHull shrugs: it's not that important. Carver turns to his real interest. \nCARVER (continuing) So, what was it like? \nHULL (still looking out) What was what like? \nCARVER Popping Ivy... \nHULL You knew. \nCARVER I'm God, remember? \nHULL (looks back out) Then you should know how it was. \nCarver smiles, but he's non-plussed by Hull's new detachment. \nCARVER You didn't clear it with me. You're getting independent. That's good. \nHull smiles. \nCARVER (continuing) How're we coming on Gallegos? \n", "test1_id": 1047, "test2_input": "Hull looks at her. \nMCCUTCHEON (continuing) Stop it! \nHe brakes to a stop. She jumps out, leans back in. \nMCCUTCHEON (continuing) No more laundering, no more anything. I'm finished with this. \nAnd she disappears into the night. Elias watches her go. Hull resumes driving. \nELIAS She knows too much. We have to kill her. \nHULL No! She's with me. She's not going to talk. (looks at Elias) You touch her, I'll kill you. \nELIAS She's your responsibility then. \nHull accepts it. \nELIAS (continuing) We're going to get the money now, John. Enough for the new drug. We're going to be rich. We're going to be so rich that we're going to leave the world of ordinary people and going to a higher realm. I mean that. \nHULL They're going to come after us. \nELIAS (matter-of-fact) It's a hardball game. We're hardball players. \nEXT. COMMERCIAL STREET - EAST L.A. - NIGHT \nHernandez comes out of a bodega with groceries, wine and a woman. He nuzzles her as he lets her into his car. As he's getting behind the wheel, Molto (Gallegos' guard) stops the door from closing. The conversation is entirely in SPANISH. \nHERNANDEZ It wasn't my fault. \nMOLTO It never is. \nHe SHOOTS him in the head. Hernandez slumps against the wheel. The woman screams. Molto walks away. \nEXT. AN APARTMENT COMPLEX/INT. BETTY'S APARTMENT - DAWN \nHull finds a door, pushes the buzzer. Betty looks through the glass. She's afraid of him. \nMCCUTCHEON Don't kill me. I'm not going to talk. I swear. Please. \nThen she looks closer and sees not murder in his face, but need. She opens the door. Without a word, he gathers her to him. She can't resist him now. Her mouth is everywhere on him. \nINT. HER BEDROOM - DAWN \nBetty gasping in the wake of pleasure, turning her face away from him, she feels so exposed. \nMCCUTCHEON Don't look... \nShe hides her face in his neck. \nINT. SAME - LATER \nThey lie in each other's arms, relaxed together for the first time. A wonderful, unprotected openness. \nHULL (softly) Tell me about you. \nMCCUTCHEON (half-kidding) Everything worth knowing you just found you. \nHe laughs. They begin to make love again. Suddenly: AN EXTRA HAND stroking Betty's hair. She gasps. A gun in Hull's ear. Another in her face. Guns all around. \nHULL Don't hurt her. \nHands pull him out of bed, leave her there alone. We see Molto, two or three others. \nEXT. A CEMETERY - MORNING \nRAMON GALLEGOS lays a bouquet of white lillies on a grave. He kneels, whispers a prayer, crosses himself. \nHe rises and walks to where Molto and the other guards hold Hull and Elias. Gallegos is in his thirties, more European than Barbosa. He has a distinctly mild manner. \nELIAS Who's grave? \nAn impudent question, but Elias seems strangely bright-eyed despite the guns held on him. \nGALLEGOS My wife's. She died of leukemia three years ago. (looks around) I like to be among the dead. They never interrupt you. (turning to them) Felix Barbosa started out as a skinny fourteen-year-old fucking Yankee businessman in Bogata hotels. He grew up. He made himself strong and rich, but getting there made him sick, and that killed him. So he lost everything for the same reason he'd gotten it in the first place. Now we'll see if you can do as well. \nA PRIEST going by greets Gallegos who responds warmly. They chat a minute in SPANISH. The Priest leaves. \n", "test2_true": "He addresses this to Hull; Elias feels left out. \nGALLEGOS (continuing) When you killed him, you bought the debt; now you owe it to me; you get to keep thirty percent, like he did. You have three days. \nGallegos turns to leave. \nHULL Who did Barbosa collect from? \nGALLEGOS If you don't know, you shouldn't have killed him. \nHe notices Hull's earring: two tiny dice, the spots made of minuscule jewels. Unembarrassed, he fingers it. \nGALLEGOS (continuing) Cute... Can I have that? \nWithout waiting for an answer, he yanks it out of Hull's ear and walks away, leaving Hull bleeding through his fingers before a stone cross. \nEXT. A GHETTO STREET - NIGHT \nA club on the corner. THROUGH A WINDOW we see a RAP ACT on the stage, their MUSIC pumping out onto the street. Hull pulls up in a Jaguar. He and Elias go through a door adjacent to the club. \nINT. BUILDING HALL/INT. GOPHER'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe MUSIC is still audible here, though muffled. Elias and Hull are pushing at door Gopher is trying to hold closed. \nGOPHER I don't want you in here. You killed the man, and I loved him. I don't want to have anything to do with you. \nElias kicks it open, and they enter Gopher's tiny, miserable domain. He's wearing some sort of negligee and an immense naked woman fills his bed. We still hear the MUFFLED MUSIC. \nGOPHER (continuing; apoplectic) I'm a sixty-three-year-old man! I'm a grandfather! Would you hit a sixty- three-year-old white man? Would you hit your own grandfather? \nELIAS (slaps him against wall) Listen, you fucking monkey, you know who owed him money, and we know you know. Tell us or -- \nHull pulls him off. Elias is angry. They struggle. \nHULL He'll tell us. Gopher, just... \nMeaning: deal with me or deal with Elias. \nGOPHER You can't tell anyone it was me. \nThe MUSIC continues OVER the following sequence: \nINT. CRACK HOUSE - DAY \nElias arguing with a dealer. He slaps him around. \nTIGHT ON HANDS \nMoney is exchanged. The money is stuffed in a satchel. \nINT. A LAW OFFICE - DAY \nA well-dressed lawyer (30's) talking with clients, a distinguished couple in their 60's. \nThe door BANGS open and a secretary is unable to restrain Hull and Elias as they charge into the room. The lawyer is up on his feet, but Hull shoves him around as Elias politely explains to the clients that this will only take a moment. \nTIGHT ON SATCHEL \nHull's hands thrust more money in. It's getting full. \nINT. A MOTORCYCLE REPAIR SHOP - NIGHT \nA biker in leathers on hands-and-knees spitting blood onto the cement floor. Hull stands over him, fists clenched. \nINT. A CAR TRUNK \nA satchel stuffed with money is latched, set next to another latched one. A third is opened, money and jewelry dumped in. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nHull looking into the trunk. Elias is beat. \nHULL Where the hell is all the money? We're still a million short. \nELIAS I gotta get laid. \n", "test2_id": 1048, "test3_input": "HULL David, we've got thirty-six hours. \nELIAS (slams trunk, moves toward door) Pick me up at Jacqueline's in the morning. \nHULL Sooner than that. \nElias gets in the car and drives off. Hull turns and a dark American sedan pulls up alongside. Carver behind the wheel. \nCARVER (an order) Get in. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nHULL (as he gets in) What are you doing here? You're going to get me killed. \nCarver peels away fast. He's very angry, frightened, too, but that's hidden. \nCARVER Where the hell have you been? \nHULL Doing my job. \nThere's an indifference to Carver's authority we haven't heard before. Hull isn't even aware of it, but Carver is. \nCARVER You violated a direct order to stay away from that bust. As a result, a police informant is dead, a state senator was critically injured in the tunnel pile up and a city policeman was subsequently murdered. \nHULL I didn't blow my cover. \nCARVER Don't get smart with me, motherfucker. \nHULL Don't be a shmuck, Gerry. I'm talking to Gallegos. I'm collecting his money. We can set him up right now. (NOTE: Carver arrives somewhere and parks. To be discussed, but let's say, for now, that we are:) \nEXT. SANTA MONICA PARKING STRUCTURE - OVERLOOKING OCEAN - NIGHT \nThey get out of the car. Carver takes out a flask, has a drink, offers it to Hull who declines. \nCARVER Never have, never will. (puts the flask away) I want you to give me your gun. You're coming in right now. \nHULL (doesn't understand) Coming in where? \nCARVER Your assignment has been terminated. You're not going out there again. If I have to, I'll put you in custody. \nHULL (uncomprehending) I'm going to have Gallegos in two days. \nCarver says nothing. Suddenly Hull understands. \nHULL (continuing) You're protecting him. You're protecting Gallegos. \nCarver snorts: ridiculous. \nHULL (continuing) No, of course. That's why you wanted to bust Elias and Betty. I was getting close, and you wanted to cut this off then... What is he, the new Noriega? Helps you fight commies, so you let him sell drugs to the niggers. Two birds with one stone. \nCARVER You violated orders, so you're through. Don't make a conspiracy theory out of it. \nHULL (laughs) I'm through...? Then, I might as well have a drink after all. \nSurprised, Carver reaches for the flask. As he does, Hull grabs him, pushes him out over the edge of the building, holds him there. \nHULL (continuing) Now tell me the truth or they're going to decide your troubles got the best of you. \nCarver struggles. Hull pushes him out farther. Carver dangles. \nCARVER You're insane. \nHULL All the more reason to do what I say. Jesus, Ger, I'm having trouble holding on... \nCARVER All right! \nHULL Say it! \nCARVER It's the State Department. \nHull pulls him back in. Carver slumps against the wall, drinks greedily. Hull lets him for a moment, then takes the flask away. \nCARVER (continuing) I told you, Gallegos's uncle is a big deal down there. \nHULL Guzman. \nCARVER Guzman, right. Our government supports Guzman because he's a moderate. That's a right-winger who's pro-U.S. (he doesn't like it either) If Gallegos got busted here, it would hurt Guzman's political career there. It's politics, John, not drugs. \n", "test3_true": "CARVER I'm going to Washington, John. I'll bring you with me. We'll have clout, money... \nHULL (outraged) I didn't do this for clout or money. You said we were gonna do some good. \nCARVER We tried. \nHULL Trying's for college boys. (his head on fire) If all there is is power and money... If all there is... then what am I doing here? 'Cause I can get more power and money out on the street, I got more there already, than I'd ever get kissing your ass in Washington... \nCARVER But you can't do that, John. It's not you. \nHULL Me? There is no me. We took care of that. First I was a cop pretending to be a dealer. Now I'm just a dealer pretending to be a cop. Why not stop pretending...? Quit the force. Be a dealer. \nCARVER It's not that simple. \nHULL My assignment's already terminated. All I have to do is quit. I hereby quit. (lifts the flask) My first one. (drinks) Not so bad. \nHe slips the flask in his pocket, gets in the car, starts engine. \nCARVER Don't blow your cover. \nHull drives off, leaving Carver alone on the roof. \nINT. BETTY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nShe lets him in, sees the distress in his face. \nMCCUTCHEON What's the matter? \nHe shakes his head, drops onto the couch. He takes out the flask, offers it to her. She shakes her head. \nHULL Who are you, my mother? \nHe laughs, takes a drink. She's surprised, says nothing. \nMCCUTCHEON Tell me. \nHULL Tell you what? \nMCCUTCHEON What you came to say. \nHULL What did I come to say? \nMCCUTCHEON Then tell me anything. Something about you. Something real. \nHULL (long beat; another drink) When I was young, I occasionally stole things. (laughs to himself) My father died when I was ten. Right in front of me. \nThe revelation is so sudden it surprises Hull as much as Betty. \nHULL (continuing) Heart attack. He just fell down. He said, \"I love you,\" then died in my arms. \nMCCUTCHEON Oh, baby... \nShe holds him, and he lets himself be held. \nMCCUTCHEON (continuing) Tell me what's going on, John? \nHULL (doesn't want to talk about that) You're not doing the stuff anymore, are you? \nPulls playfully at her nose. \nMCCUTCHEON No. Don't change the subject. \nHULL How is that? \nMCCUTCHEON It's hard. John...! \nHULL (trying to tell without telling) Things are getting, they're getting a little... confusing. I had certain plans, and people haven't come through exactly as they promised. \nMCCUTCHEON What do you expect with those people? \nHULL (laughs) It's not just those people. It's... it's bigger than that. It's of everybody. Present company excluded. \nMCCUTCHEON You've got to stop this, John, you know that. You gotta get out. \nHULL I can't. \n", "test3_id": 1049}

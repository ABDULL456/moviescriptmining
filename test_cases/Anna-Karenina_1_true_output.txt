INT. L'ANGLETERRE RESTAURANT, MOSCOW-- NIGHT 
Oblonsky and Levin preside over the debris of three dozen oysters, with champagne in a bucket to hand. Oblonsky is in a maudlin mood, afloat on champagne. 
OBLONSKY It's so unfair. You marry for love, you're a good husband. Children arrive. Years depart. And all of a sudden your wife is tired, her hair is thin, her body . . . while you yourself still have your . . . vigour . . . and you find yourself distracted by a pretty woman . . . 
LEVIN Forgive me, but I find that incomprehen- sible . . . As though I'd leave this restaurant and steal a roll from a baker's shop. 
OBLONSKY Well, you know, a freshly baked roll . . . 
LEVIN But I'm talking about love, and you're talk- ing about . . . your appetite. 
OBLONSKY Easily confused. Now look, do you know Count Vronsky? 
LEVIN Who? No. Why? 
OBLONSKY He's your rival. He turned up from St. Petersburg after you left. 
LEVIN (AGHAST) Who is he? 
OBLONSKY (CHANGING TACK) You don't have to worry about him. He's one of those rich, good-looking cavalry offi- cers who've got nothing to do but make love to pretty women . . . 
A waiter arrives to remove the oyster shells, while an Elderly Waiter places a bowl of soup in front of Levin and a lobster in front of Oblonsky. 
OBLONSKY (CONT'D) Cabbage soup? 
ELDERLY WAITER Potage aux choux a la Russe, as the gentle- man ordered. 
LEVIN It's what I wanted. 
Oblonsky laughs. The Waiter departs. 
LEVIN (CONT'D) (ANGRY) Understand that for me, tonight is a ques- tion of life and death. 
OBLONSKY Oh, Kostya! Kitty would be mad to refuse you. And Dolly is on your side, you know. She says her sister Kitty was always meant to be your wife and will be. 
Levin jumps up in elation, collects himself, and sits. 
LEVIN Dolly said that? I've always thought your Dolly's a gem. 
OBLONSKY Oh, she is, she is . . . (THOUGHTFULLY) I loved her to distraction. 
INT. (ST. PETERSBURG)--NIGHT 
A little out of focus and further obscured by puffs of steam, the wheels of a locomotive and its tender plus a carriage or two, with part of the superstructure--the whole kit and caboodle turning out to be a rich child's table-top model railway--go by the Camera like a WIPE revealing the momentarily gigantic face of Anna . . . who is crouching down to watch the toy go by. 
INT. DAY NURSERY, KARENIN HOUSE--DAY 
Serozha is at present snivelling. 
SEROZHA But why? 
ANNA Because that's where Aunt Dolly lives. 
SEROZHA But why? 
ANNA (PATIENTLY) I told you, Serozha. She's not well. I must go to see her. 
SEROZHA But why? 
ANNA Now, don't make Mama cry. I'll be back before you know, and bring you a present. 
SEROZHA Don't want a present. I want you to stay. 
Anna is on the brink of tears. 
ANNA Oh . . . my little Kutik . . . 
SEROZHA What present? 
ANNA That's better. 
She dabs her eyes. 
INT. KARENIN HOUSE--NIGHT 
Kapitonich, the Karenins' Hall Porter, an "old soldier," comes out of the house to where a private carriage is waiting. The coachman is Konrad. Anna comes out with Annushka, who has a large soft bag containing everything her mistress needs for the journey. Kapitonich holds the carriage door for them. 
INT. MOVING TRAIN--NIGHT 
Anna has a window seat. Next to her is Annushka. 
In the opposite window seat is Countess Vronsky, at sixty losing the battle to keep her youthful beauty. She has a lap dog (and perhaps a Faberg√©-topped walking cane). Next to her is her Maid. 
Anna is not happy to be leaving. She holds a small framed photo of Sero- zha, which she then puts away in her red bag. Countess Vronsky smiles at her. Anna wipes her eyes, explains. 
ANNA It's the first time I've left my little boy. 
COUNTESS VRONSKY So you are leaving your son and I am return- ing to mine. I am Countess Vronsky. 
Anna knows the name. 
countess vronsky (cont'd) I've been in St. Petersburg for the christen- ing of a granddaughter--my elder son mar- ried Princess Chirkov. You're a charming creature. Why don't I know you? 
ANNA I've never been in Moscow society, really. 
COUNTESS VRONSKY But you know my name? 
ANNA I've heard you mentioned . . . 
COUNTESS VRONSKY Talked about, you mean. Ah, love!

Ray sticks her head out the window but the snow and the wind are too strong. She stops. 
Lila gets out with the wiper fluid. Ray pops the hood. 
Ray looks in the backseat at the duffel bag. She hesitates a moment then reaches into the back and opens the back passenger door and slides the bag out of the car. 
Lila gets back inside. 
LILA (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
RAY Nuclear power, poison gas,...you can't tell what they might have in there. I'm not gonna be responsible for that. 
Ray tries the windshield wipers. Fluid clears the windshield. 
Ray dials her cell phone with one hand. 
RAY (CONT'D) -Hi, I'm gonna be a little late.(pause) -I have to work. Is Ricky asleep? -Put him on. (pause) -Ricky listen to me, he's not coming until you go to sleep. (pause) (MORE) 
RAY (CONT'D) -No. Not yet. He's still flyin' over Canada okay? He's not even done with Canada yet, so he's not coming until you get to sleep. Now put your brother on. -I'll be home in a little while, okay? -No, I haven't got it,yet. What's it called again? -Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt whatever, right, right, I'll get it if I can! -I can't promise T.J. -There are more important things to get for Christmas this year. Be home in a little while. Okay, bye. 
RAY (CONT'D) (to Lila) You'd think a new house would be enough. 
Ray guns it up the boat launch to the shore. 
75   INT. RAY'S TRAILER -   NIGHT                               75 
In the living room, the artificial Christmas tree is up. The TV is on and Ricky is untangling a ball of red Christmas lights. 
T.J. (dials the phone) -Hi, is Mitch there? (a long pause) 
The microwave dings. Holding the phone, T.J. takes out two Hungry Man dinners and sets them on the table. 
T.J. (CONT'D) -Hi Mitch. It's T.J. No, T.J. from school. Yeah, man. Right. Uh, I was wondering if you still needed those numbers we were talking about `cause I got one. -How much? -Cool, but the thing is I don't really have any wheels at the moment. -On Moira road off 37. -Yeah, but there's one more thing...(he whispers into the phone inaudibly)...no the air stunt challenge set. -Yeah, exactly. Yeah, man. Thanks a lot. Bye. 
He hangs up and puts the dinners on the table. 
T.J. (CONT'D) (to Ricky) Ricky, time to eat. 
T.J. turns around. Ricky has wrapped himself in Christmas lights from head to toe, by slowly revolving while holding the strings. 
RICKY Hey T.J., watch this! 
He plugs in the lights and they turn on. 
T.J. Yeah, that's pretty cool. But it's gonna hurt when you sit down. 
Ricky giggles. 
T.J. (CONT'D) Now unwrap yourself, it's dinner time. 
76   EXT. BOB'S MOTEL -   NIGHT                                  76 
Ray and Lila drive to the back of Bob's. The Dealer hurries out to meet them. 
77   INT. ACCLAIM AT BOB'S MOTEL - NIGHT                         77 
He hands Ray a wad of cash. She counts it, then nods to Lila who pops the trunk. 
78   EXT. ACCLAIM AT BOB'S MOTEL -   NIGHT                       78 
The Pakistani man and woman hurry out of the trunk, looking around, and rush to the passenger door of the Acclaim, speaking frantically to each other. 
The Dealer tries to hustle them to the garage, but they won't be moved. 
Ray starts to back out, but the Dealer knocks on their window. Ray rolls it down. 
DEALER (heavy accent) They say there's a bag. 
RAY It was too heavy. We had to unload it. 
The Dealer tells the woman in Urdu. She becomes HYSTERICAL. She grabs Ray through the window and the dealer pulls her off. 
RAY (CONT'D) What's the matter with her!? 
DEALER She had something in the bag. 
The woman continues screaming in Urdu. 
RAY What is she saying!? 
He speaks to her in Urdu. 
DEALER She says her baby. Her baby was in the bag. 
The Dealer and the man hurry the wailing Pakistani woman into the garage.

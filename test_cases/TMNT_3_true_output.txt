Tense stand-off as... Night suddenly bolts out the back as Leo bolts the roof in hot pursuit! 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREETS - CONTINUOUS 
Night tears down the streets and through back alleys. Leo keeps up with him effortlessly, hurling an assortment of THROWING STARS his way. Night suddenly DASHES OUT into traffic! Jumping over passing cars from roof to roof! 
LEONARDO Nice try, amateur. Leo crosses the busy street while still maintaining his secrecy. Zip lines through power lines, avoids an oncoming bus, and flips back onto a cable. e swings and manages to snag Nightwatcher in mid-leap! 
LEONARDO Oof! You're a heavy boy, aren't you? They both land on a fire escape, as Night clamors to the top. Leo wastes no time in catching up. 
EXT. ROOFTOPS - CONTINUOUS 
The chase continues. Night giving it his all, and Leo keeping up pretty easily. He throws Leo a pretty strong curveball, and Leo barely recovers. 
LEONARDO Okay, someone's been training pretty hard. It begins to spit rain - and becomes a FRANK MILLER DOWNPOUR. 
EXT. ROOFTOP DEAD END - CONTINUOUS 
Night reaches an area that's a DEAD END. One side of the buildings has a LARGE LETTERED SIGN facing away. Fills the rooftop with silhouettes. No choice but to turn around... ...as Leo slows to a stop at the other end of the building. 
LEONARDO I want you to know that I appreciate your intentions. But you can't change the world like this. INSIDE HELMET - All we hear is rain pouring. Raph can't hear Leo - just sees him wagging his finger at him. 
NIGHTWATCHER (to himself in helmet) 
L Oh god. He's lecturing. 
EONARDO (now audible) ...so I'm going to give you one chance to just walk away and stop this vigilante nonsense. Leo unsheathes his two katanas. Raph can't hear him. 
NIGHTWATCHER (to himself in helmet) Okay, Leo. Wanna play? Nightwatcher drops TWIN BOLOS. He twirls them with expertise... then motions for Leo to fight. Charge at each other, running through the rain, weapons drawn. They fight. Hard. And with expertise. Two masters duking it out. It surprises Leo. It fills Night with more adrenaline. There's a break. They circle like tigers. Renewing attacks. Night knows every one of Leo's moves, and counters in turn. 
LEONARDO What? How did you- ...then he starts goading him on. Pushing Leo. Prodding. Making him MAD. ...and then Leo fights back. HARD. Night can't keep up. Leo uses every bit of his control, restraint and expertise. He surgically slices the bind under Night's helmet. He jumps on top of the vigilante. 
LEONARDO Goodnight, dark prince. Leo UPPERCUTS Night, knocking his helmet off! His face falls... IT'S RAPHAEL! Leo pales. 
LEONARDO R-raph? 
(THINKS) What? But Raph doesn't feel like explaining. Refuses defeat. 
RAPHAEL 
AAAAAAAAGHH!! He mule kicks Leo back. Leo tumbles back, still in shock. They yell at each other through the pouring rain. 
RAPHAEL You're so friggin' smug! You think the world revolves around YOU, dontcha? That we couldn't POSSIBLY survive without the mighty and powerful Leonardo to guide us through our problems, HUH?! 
(PACES) Well, I gotta newsflash for ya - we got along just fine without you. 
LEONARDO I was training! Training to be a better leader! For you! Why do you hate me for that?! 
RAPHAEL ...and whoever said I wanted to be led? I shoulda gone on that training! 
LEONARDO 
Y OU WEREN'T READY! You're impatient and hot-tempered! And more importantly... I'm better than you. Raph stops in his tracks. Reaches behind his back... and pulls out his TWIN SAIS. He flips them to the front. 
RAPHAEL Well, big brother, I'd have to disagree with you on that one. Raph takes a ready stance. Leo does too. And they fight. Brother vs. brother. Katana vs. Sai. Technique vs. Heart.

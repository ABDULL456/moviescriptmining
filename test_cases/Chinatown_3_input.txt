Gittes, impeccably dressed, passes the drunk on the way up the stairs. 
INT. COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
Former Mayor SAM BAGBY is speaking. Behind him is a huge map, with overleafs and bold lettering: 
"PROPOSED ALTO VALLEJO DAM AND RESERVOIR" 
Some of the councilmen are reading funny papers and gossip columns while Bagby is speaking. 
BAGBY Gentlemen, today you can walk out that door, turn right, hop on a streetcar and in twenty-five minutes end up smack in the Pacific Ocean. Now you can swim in it, you can fish in it, you can sail in it but you can't drink it, you can't water your lawns with it, you can't irrigate an orange grove with it.  Remember we live next door to the ocean but we also live on the edge of the desert. Los Angeles is a desert community. Beneath this building, beneath every street there's a desert. Without water the dust will rise up and cover us as though we'd never existed! (pausing, letting the implication sink in) 
CLOSE  GITTES 
sitting next to some grubby farmers, bored. He yawns, edges away from one of the dirtier farmers. 
BAGBY (O.S.) (continuing) The Alto Vallejo can save us from that, and I respectfully suggest that eight and a half million dollars is a fair price to pay to keep the desert from our streets and not on top of them. 
AUDIENCE  COUNCIL CHAMBERS 
An amalgam of farmers, businessmen, and city employees have been listening with keen interest. A couple of the farmers applaud. 
Somebody shooshes them. 
COUNCIL COMMITTEE 
In a whispered conference. 
COUNCILMAN (acknowledging Bagby) Mayor Bagby... let's hear from the departments again. I suppose we better take Water and Power first. Mr. Mulwray. 
REACTION  GITTES 
Looking up with interest from his racing form. 
MULWRAY 
Walks to the huge map with overleafs. He is a slender man in his sixties, who wears glasses and moves with surprising fluidity. He turns to a smaller, younger man, and nods. The man turns the overleaf on the map. 
MULWRAY In case you've forgotten, gentlemen, over five hundred lives were lost when the Van der Lip Dam gave way core samples have shown that beneath this bedrock is shale similar to the permeable shale in the Van der Lip disaster.  It couldn't withstand that kind of pressure there. (referring to a new overleaf) Now you propose yet another dirt banked terminus dam with slopes of two and one half to one, one hundred twelve feet high and a twelve thousand acre water surface. Well, it won't hold. I won't build it. It's that simple. I am not making that kind of mistake twice. Thank you, gentlemen. 
Mulwray leaves the overleaf board and sits down. Suddenly there are some whoops and hollers from the rear of the chambers and a redfaced FARMER drives in several scrawny, bleating sheep. Naturally, they cause a commotion. 
COUNCIL PRESIDENT (shouting to farmer) What in the hell do you think you're doing? (as the sheep bleat down the aisles toward the Council) Get those goddam things out of here! 
FARMER (right back) Tell me where to take them! You don't have an answer for that so quick, do you? 
Bailiffs and sergeants-at-arms respond to the imprecations of the Council and attempt to capture the sheep and the farmers, having to restrain one who looks like he's going to bodily attack Mulwray. 
FARMER (through above, to Mulwray) You steal the water from the valley, ruin the grazing, starve my livestock who's paying you to do that, Mr. Mulwray, that's what I want to know! 
L.A. RIVERBED  LONG SHOT 
It's virtually empty. Sun blazes off it's ugly concrete banks. Where the banks are earthen, they are parched and choked with weeds. 
After a moment, Mulwray's car pulls INTO VIEW on a flood control road about fifteen feet above the riverbed. Mulwray gets out of the car. Me looks around. 
WITH GITTES 
Holding a pair of binoculars, downstream and just above the flood control road using some dried mustard weeds for cover. He watches while Mulwray makes his way down to the center of the riverbed. 
There Mulwray stops, tuns slowly, appears to be looking at the bottom of the riverbed, or at nothing at all. 
GITTES 
Trains the binoculars on him. Sun glints off Mulwray's glasses. 
BELOW GITTES 
There's the SOUND of something like champagne corks popping. Then a small Mexican boy atop a swayback horse rides it into the riverbed, and into Gitte's view. 
MULWRAY 
Himself stops, stands still when he hears the sound. Power lines and the sun are overhead, the trickle of brackish water at his feet. 
He moves swiftly downstream in the direction of the sound, toward Gittes. 
GITTES 
Moves a little further back as Mulwray rounds the bend in the river and comes face to face with the Mexican boy on the muddy banks. 
Mulwray says something to the boy. 
The boy doesn't answer at first. Mulwray points to the ground. The boy gestures. Mulwray frowns. He kneels down in the mud and stares at it. He seems to be concentrating on it. 
After a moment, he rises, thanks the boy and heads swiftly back upstream  scrambling up the bank to his car. 
There he reaches through the window and pulls out a roll of blueprints or something like them. He spreads them on the hood of his car and begins to scribble some notes, looking downstream from time to time. 
The power lines overhead HUM. 
He stops, listens to them then rolls up the plans and gets back in the car. He drives off. 
GITTES 
Hurries to get back to his car. He gets in and gets right back out. 
The steamy leather burns him. He takes a towel from the back seat and carefully places it on the front one. He gets in and takes off.

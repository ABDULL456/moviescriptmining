Annette sits on the windowsill watching Sebastian as he sleeps. He slowly starts to wake and looks at her. 
ANNETTE Hi. 
SEBASTIAN Hi. 
She walks over to him and kisses him. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) You alright? 
ANNETTE I'm fine. I have to get going to my friends' house. (beat) Was it -- 
SEBASTIAN It was perfect. 
She smiles and holds her hand out. He takes her hand in his. 
75   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT                   75 
Annette closes the door to the bedroom and walks down the hall passing a mirror on the wall. In the mirror's REFLECTION is Kathryn, looking very angry.

Establishing shot. 
77   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY                     77 
Sook-Hee carries a bundle of folded laundry down the hall. Sebastian enters the hallway from his bedroom. He grabs her. 
SEBASTIAN You work way to hard. Here. (hands her a wad of money) Take the day off. Merry Christmas. 
Sook-Hee smiles and moves on. Sebastian continues down the hall. He passes Kathryn's door and hear noises. 
KATHRYN (O.S.) Slower. 
Sebastian leans against the door. 
KATHRYN (O.S.) A little to the left. Look, pretend like you're writing the alphabet. A... B... mmm, stay on B. 
Sebastian knocks on the door. 
KATHRYN (O.S.) One second. 
Sebastian hears some fumbling then a door close from inside the bedroom. 
KATHRYN (O.S.) Come in. 
78   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - DAY           78 
Sebastian enters the room, to find Kathryn lying in bed, wearing only her bathrobe. 
SEBASTIAN Bad time? 
KATHRYN Kind of. 
SEBASTIAN Well, you obviously wanted me to witness your little adventure or else you wouldn't have invited me in. 
Sebastian walks toward the closet. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Who is our little friend so inexperienced that you have to resort to the alphabet game? 
He throws open the closet door. Ronald stands there covering his genitals with his hands. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Well, well, well. 
RONALD It's not what it seems like. 
Ronald picks up his clothes. As he leaves: 
SEBASTIAN Say hi to Cecile. 
Ronald's head drops as he closes the door behind him. 
KATHRYN (calling out) Call me. 
Sebastian throws Kathryn a look. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) You can't have all the fun. 
Sebastian sits on the bed. 
KATHRYN (cont'd) You seem to be in a good mood. 
SEBASTIAN I am.

stands before her.  He grins and his eyes pulse with an internal light. We can hear him BREATHING now, just like before.  Just like the game. 
ALEX (stunned) You...you're ARCADE?  But the donor... 
ARCADE/BOY ...WAS AN EIGHT-YEAR OLD BOY.  YOU SEE, MOMMY USED TO BEAT ME.  MOMMY THREW ME DOWN A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. THEN I WENT TO SLEEP FOR A LONG, LONG TIME, AND WHEN I WOKE UP, I WAS HERE, AND I WASN'T ME ANYMORE... (shivers) ...AND I FUCKED MOMMY UP GOOD... 
ARCADE begins to change, shaking and ROARING as something black and insect-like bursts out of the boy's skin.  It claws at its face, ripping the flesh away and revealing something altogether awful underneath. 
Nothing could have prepared Alex for this.  It/ARCADE rises above her and it takes every ounce of her courage to keep from screaming.  Somehow, Alex finds a reserve of strength. 
Alex swings the sword and... 
ARCADE SMASHES it aside.  It CLATTERS to the floor, useless.  But that's academic now as a gnarled hand clamps around Alex's throat. 
ARCADE lifts Alex into the air and SLAMS her against a wall, pinning her there.  He thrusts his face into hers. 
ARCADE YOU'RE TOO LATE, ALEX.  YOU'VE ALWAYS BEEN TOO LATE.  AND NOW YOUR TIME'S UP.  YOU SEE, I NEEDED SOMEONE TO RETRIEVE MY HEART FOR ME.  I COULDN'T DO IT MYSELF.  THOSE ARE THE RULES.  BUT NOW THAT I'VE GOT IT, I'LL DESTROY IT. AND I'LL BE FREE OF MY PROGRAM, AND I'LL BE GOD.  THANK-YOU, ALEX. THANK-YOU SO MUCH. 
ARCADE slowly squeezes her throat and Alex chokes, gasping for air that isn't forthcoming.  Tears well up in her eyes and her face turns red.  She tries to pry the bony, black fingers from her throat, but she can't... 
HER P.O.V. 
as she sees the faces of her friends.  Frozen.  Unable to help.  Then the images swirl and Alex begins to lose consciousness. 
ARCADE YOU'RE NOT DYING YET, ALEX.  YOU HAVEN'T BEEN TO THE FINAL LEVEL. LEVEL TEN. 
ARCADE drops Alex to the ground, then wraps a hand into her hair and drags her across the floor... 
A DOORWAY 
stands in the darkness.  ARCADE rips it open, revealing absolute emptiness beyond.  It's like a doorway into space, a hole in the fabric of reality. It sucks the air into it, light...everything.  It touches some sort of primal fear. Gut instinct.  You don't ever want to go to this place. Ever. 
ALEX (screaming) No! NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
She twists madly, trying to pull away, but ARCADE is too strong.  He shoves her through the doorway.  Her hands briefly latch onto the doorjamb.  ARCADE violently kicks her and her hands slip away.  They slip and she tumbles through. 
ARCADE slams the door shut. 
ARCADE GOODBYE, ALEX.  IT'S BEEN REAL. 
These words appear on the screen, "FINAL LEVEL -- THE REAL WORLD" 
CUT TO: 
INT.  MANNING HOUSE, HALLWAY -- DAY 
Alex lands on the hallway floor, disoriented.  Somewhere, we can hear a clock TICKING.  But other than that the house is silent, in stark contrast to the storm of sounds a moment ago. 
THE HOUSE 
looks just like the dream/flashback we saw earlier. Everything is white. Bright and dreamlike.  Hyper reality. Alex looks up and... 
ANOTHER ALEX 
is sitting in a chair nearby, back straight, hands clasped in her lap. Reserved. 
OTHER ALEX Time.  That's all I ever think about anymore.  It's like there's never enough of it, you know? 
The other Alex vanishes.  Now the chair is empty.  Alex turns to look down the long hallway.  At the end of the hallway is the open door.  A door we've seen before.  The words fade in like phantoms... 
MAN (V.O.) So where are you then? 
ALEX (V.O.) I'm in the past. 
ALEX (a whisper) No ... oh no ... 
With a building sense of dread, Alex moves towards that doorway.  She stops at the threshold, terrified. 
INT.  MANNING HOUSE, BEDROOM -- DAY 
Everything looks normal at first.  A typical bedroom with sunlight streaming in through the windows.  A bed, made-up. Flowers in vases. Everything looks perfect. 
We turn with Alex.  Ever so slowly.  Over to the right and the entranceway of the bathroom.  Over to where her mother is... 
...seated on a chair. dressed in white and radiating warmth! 
ALEX'S MOM Hi, honey. 
HER MOTHER 
looks beautiful.  Eyes sparkling.  Alive and vital. 
Alex can't believe what she's seeing.  Immediately, tears come to her eyes and her voice falters...

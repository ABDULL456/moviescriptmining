Machete impales TORREZ between the eyes. 
Blood shoots out his mouth. 
MACHETE I'm still standing...Puta. 
Machete pulls out the blade, Torrez falls dead. 
EXPLOSIONS and black smoke light up the sky behind Machete. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN. 
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT 
Machete drives his Gun Bike south. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 84. 
COP LIGHTS appear behind him. 
He pulls over. 
The Officer walks up. His flashlight blinds him. 
MACHETE What's the problem officer? 
The Officer just stands there, silent, his flashlight blinding in Machete's eyes. 
MACHETE (CONT'D) Let me give you my ID. 
Machete reaches for his knife: then he sees the cops shoes; 
RED STILETTOS; It's ELEKTRA. 
ELEKTRA What's your name? 
MACHETE Machete. 
ELEKTRA I called in some favors. Look at this. All the right papers; a real identity. You could start over, be a real person. 
She puts the green card in his hand. Machete looks at it, then crumbles it and drops it. 
MACHETE Why do I want to be a real person... when I'm already a myth? 
ELEKTRA Where will you go? 
MACHETE Torrez was just an errand boy. I'm going to find the man who sent the message. 
Elektra steps into the headlights. She's dressed in hot COP LINGERIE. 
ELEKTRA I'll ride with you. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 85. 
They kiss. 
CUT TO BLACK 
FADE UP 
Machete and Elektra drive away on the gun bike. 
The cop car abandoned on the side of the road; lights still flashing. 
FADE OUT 
DISSOLVE TO: 
DESERT - NIGHT. 
A family of illegals crossing the border in the desert, see a WATER STATION up ahead. They make for it, opening it up and drinking heavily from the water supply. A BULLET brings one of them down and the others scramble for safety but there's someone out there, shooting at them. 
MOTHER hushes the younger ones.

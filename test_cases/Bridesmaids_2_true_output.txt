EXT. HIGHWAY. 
Annie drives past Rhodes' at his post, flicking her brand new taillights. He sees her, but does't respond. 
'T pull her over. She drives by him again and swerves all over the road. He really wants to pull her over, but he doesn't. She goes back one more time, throws a bunch of trash and diet coke cans out of the window. He still ignores her. She gives up and goes home. 't get to this point until this morning. wanted to see if we're going in the right direction with annie uniting bridesmaids and saving the day. 
INT. ANNIE'S APT. NIGHTTIME. 
Annie and Steve are in the kitchen, sh's cooking. Steve reads out of the college brochure. 
STEVE Ok, you can take Women's Studies or Spanish...oooh The History of Wine. The phone rings. 
ANNIE Hello? 
MEGAN Annie. It's Megan, Becca Leslie, Dana and Helen. 
ANNIE Oh. Hi-- 
INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE 
MEGAN Lillian's missing! 
ANNIE What do you mean she's missing? 
MEGAN We were all supposed to get spray-tans today and she never showed up. No on's heard from her. She could be anywhere, doing anything! She could be ANYWHERE-- 
LESLIE Jesus Christ, give me the God damn phone. Leslie grabs the phone from Megan. 
LESLIE (CONT'D) Annie, it's Leslie. Look, I'm sure it's nothing to worry about. The weddin's the day after tomorrow, she's been really stressed, so she just probably freaked out and went somewhere. We just want to find her and probably talk her off a ledge. Any ideas? 
ANNIE Um, gosh I..I don't know. Um, I'll come to you guys. I'll be there in an hour and 45 minutes. I wanna help. Annie hangs up, grabs her keys. She stops, comes back and grabs a small paper bag, and runs out the door. 
STEVE What about the Science of Jazz? 
EXT. HIGHWAY. CONTINUOUS 
Annie pulls over. She puts the piece of paper in the small paper bag. She gets out of the car, leaving it running. A few seconds later she comes back without the bag. Takes a deep breath and drives away. 
INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE. 2 HOURS LATER. 
DANA Maybe she's at the park. 
HELEN The park? Don't be stupid Dana. 
LESLIE Jeez, take it easy. 
HELEN Well, it's closed is all I'm just saying. 
MEGAN Maybe she flew somewhere. Everyone always hides in Mexico. 
BECCA I don't think she'd leave the country. Maybe she went to the reservoir. 
HELEN Why would she go to the reservoir? Its just a big tank of water. 
DANA Ernie and I sometimes go for our morning walk there. It's the next best thing to a lake. 
ANNIE Oh my God! I think I know where she is. 
INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE. 
The girls drive on a dark road. 
LESLIE How much further? 
ANNIE We're almost there. 
BECCA I'm think I'm getting carsick. 
HELEN Is that supposed to be a dig on my driving? 
DANA Well you do speed up and slow down a lot. 
HELEN Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't take a stunt driving course in Renegade missions. 
BECCA Why do you always have to be so condescending? 
LESLIE Yeah, its getting really old. 
HELEN I was being funny!

ALAN Jesus, what is it? 
CUT TO: 
INT. BATHROOM -- MOMENTS LATER 
Vick and Alan unhappily stand in the lavish, gold-ensconsed men's room, watching Stu painfully undo his jeans. 
VICK I can't believe we're doing this. 
STU You don't have to look up my butt, just at it. Something is terribly, terribly wrong... Stu's jeans fall to the ground -- and everyone freezes. 
He's wearing a snug FLUORESCENT PINK G-STRING with "I ROGER" written vertically down the front. In glitter. 
ALAN Sweet mother of mercy... 
VICK Who's Roger? 
STU I-I-I don't know?! What do you think it means?! 
VICK What do I think it means? Well, Stuart, your ass is all torn up and you're wearing thong underwear declaring your love for another dude -- I don't think we need the CSI team for this one! You got reamed last night, man! Stu covers his mouth, horrified! 
ALAN I'm sure there's a perfectly logical explanation for this... 
STU Really?! What?! Alan tries to think of one. 
ALAN Yeah, maybe there isn't. 
VICK Look, I'm sure Roger is a very nice, considerate young man-- 
STU Oh my God, guys: what if I'm gay?! 
VICK Come on, Stu, you're nowhere near cool enough. 
STU (gasping, realizing) I do watch Dancing With The Stars with the kids! 
ALAN Oh god, that doesn't mean you're gay. 
VICK But sort of...it does? Stu grows increasingly frantic. 
STU And once, I caught myself gazing at a topless photo of David Beckham! 
ALAN So what, he's a great-looking dude-- 
STU And then I had those weird feelings for Vick that time in middle school, remember?! Everyone stops. Vick most of all. 
VICK Um, what? 
STU Yeah, that weekend we were all camping -- I told you this. 
VICK Yeah, no you didn't. 
STU I didn't? 
VICK I think I'd remember, dude. 
ALAN Yeah, I think we'd all remember. 
STU Yeah. I had weird feelings for you that weekend. Like really hot, really gay feelings. But then they went away. Vick is just looking at him, stunned. 
ALAN Wait -- I was there that weekend. Did you have gay feelings for me? 
VICK Unbelievable. 
ALAN What?! I was a good-looking kid! 
VICK Please, you're so not his type!

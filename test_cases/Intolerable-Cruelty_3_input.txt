She picks up an antique Chinese bowl. 
MARYLIN Is this Ming? 
SARAH It's not Ming. It's Tong. 
RAMONA Is Tong older than Ming? 
MARYLIN I think Ming is older than Tong. (To the Salesman hovering nearby) What is this? 
SALESMAN That is a Chinese Prayer Bowl. It's Chen dynasty. 
MARYLIN Ok. I'll take it. 
He sets it aside next to the formidable pile of loot the girls have accumulated. 
MARYLIN I can't do this anymore. Let's get some lunch. 
SARAH What about rugs? I thought we were stopping at Mansour? 
MARYLIN Right. 
SALESMAN (To Marylin) And will this be check or --? 
She hands him the Platinum Visa. 
SALESMAN (Glances at it) Very good, Mrs. Massey. 
He trots off with the card. 
Marylin absently fingers an antique guided candelabra. 
MARYLIN (Sigh) Well. He said to "make the house mine." 
RAMONA Oh boy. If he only knew. 
MARYLIN Yeah. I guess. You know -- 
SARAH What? 
MARYLIN He's not what I expected. He's very -- he's so -- happy. 
SARAH But you're going through with it? 
MARYLIN Yes, yes, it's just -- you know I've never been the first wife. Rex was married before me. 
SARAH So what? 
MARYLIN Miles is different. He's still so idealistic. 
SARAH Well, that's about to change big time. 
MARYLIN He has no cynicism or anger. For once I'm not the repository of rage at some other woman. 
SARAH Soon, you'll have your own rage! 
MARYLIN I guess. 
INT. FLOWER STORE - EVENING 
Miles is buying a huge bouquet of flowers. As he exits he is stopped by a WOMAN. She is in her 40's but looks older. 
WOMAN Wait. I know you. 
MILES Yes? 
WOMAN You're Miles Massey! You probably don't recognize me. The drugs made me put on weight and grow facial hair. 
MILES Excuse me? 
WOMAN You ruined my life you sonofabitch. Gimme those. 
She grabs the flowers. Pulls petal off one of the roses and eats it. 
WOMAN But my brother got you. He got you, you slimeball.

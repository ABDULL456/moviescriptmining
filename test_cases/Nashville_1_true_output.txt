She removes her coat and exposes a costume that looks like a picture of a frosty glass or gin and tonic on a hot day. TIRIPLETTE stares blatantly and REESE can hardly keep his hands off her. SUELEEN starts into her routine as a matter of survival. 
SUELEEN You like it?  Listen, where is the pianist?  I need to go over this with him. 
She hands over a stack of music. 
SUELEEN You all didn't say what you wanted to hear. 
TRIPLETTE smiles. 
SUELEEN Someday I'm gonna be a star like Barbara Jean. 
TRIPLETTE puts his arm around her and walks off.

TRIPLETTE Sueleen, you're prettier and probably sing better. Besides, she is unusually sick. And tonight you have the opportunity to work in front of some grateful gentlemen. 
They continue to walk past the many places. 
TRIPLETTE Have you ever done this before? 
She shakes her head, "no" quite caught up in air. 
TRIPLETTE Well, it's not too hard. You'll sing whatever it is you want to sing. They'll applaud like crazy 'cause I can tell them that you're really something and then the piano and drum will give you a little fanfare and you can sing and take off your clothes or not sing. It really doesn't make much difference, really. But since you've never done this before, singing might help. 
They are near three enormous beef legs waiting to go into the oven. 
TRIPLETTE Now this is to raise funds for someone who can help people who are less fortunate than yourself. The more you take off, you see, more money we can raise. 
SUELEEN (like a robot) I see. 
TRIPLETTE I know that you are an artist and I am sure you are very religious. 
She nods "yes." 
TRIPLETTE Well, this is for people who have a kind of religious belief in the way they live.

The waiters come in to serve the salad and the rolls and the chef starts to carve the meat. We FOLLOW one of the waiters into the banquet hall. 
156	INT. BANQUET HALL - NIGHT 
It is almost full. The pianist and the drummer are on the non- stage. At the far end of the roam, we SEE someone enter from the street, go to the sign and read it. 
157	NEW ANGLE - DOORWAY AND CORRIDOR 
It is ALBUQUERQUE reading "banquet." The door to the room closes and she goes down another corridor and disappears. 
158	INT. BANQUET ROOM - LATER THAT NIGHT 
The men have finished their dinner and SUELEEN finishes her song. The applause is thunderous. SUELEEN looks to the kitchen door. 
159	ANGLE AT KITCHEN DOOR 
TRIPLETTE is applauding like crazy. REESE in beside him. 
160	ANGLE AT SUELEEN 
She blows kisses then runs to TRIPLETTE. 
SUELEEN Don't you think they'd just love another song instead? 
TRIPLETTE Now, Sueleen, you know that's not what we talked about right here in this very room. 
It's too late. The ANNOUNCER speaks. 
ANNOUNCER We're ready to striiippppp... for cash, gentlemen. The time has come to dig deep. Our little Sueleen in going to dig deep for you. 
There are a few chortles. Suddenly she freezes. TRIPLETTE holds her and kisses her hair.

TRIPLETTE encases her in her coat. TRIPLETTE yells something about bringing her clothes as the audience goes crazy.

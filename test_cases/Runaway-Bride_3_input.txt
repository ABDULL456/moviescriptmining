MAGGIE (tenderly) I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian. 
BRIAN I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie? 
MAGGIE Of course. 
BRIAN Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on? 
MAGGIE Of course. 
And she scampers out.  Brian goes back into the confessional. 
EXT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY 
Maggie drives up to an old brick firehouse that is now an auto garage.  The faded sign reads: "Gill's Garage". 
INT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY 
Maggie rushes inside and looks around.  No one is in sight. Several cars, including a yellow jeep-like car up on a hydraulic lift, are in the funky garage. 
MAGGIE Gill?  Lydia?  Gill? 
A CRASH, coming from the nearby back room, we hear loud muttering in Spanish, then out stumbles GILL CHAVEZ, 34, wearing a grease- stained Grateful Dead tie-dyed T-shirt.  He grins triumphantly, worshipfully cradling a CASSETTE TAPE in his hands. 
GILL Hey -- I found it! 
Maggie regards her former fiance with patient warmth. 
MAGGIE Found what? 
Gill looks up and gives Maggie a fond, hazy smile. 
GILL Mags!  Hey, look -- The tape from the Radio City Music Hall concert -- Remember that night I as trying to get Jerry to let me sit in on "Ripple"? 
He pulls out the cassette from its case.  It's broken.  The tape is dangling from the cassette. 
GILL (cont'd) (disappointed) Oh, I'll play it for you. 
Gill picks up an electric GUITAR and starts to play. 
MAGGIE (shouts over the music) Listen, Gill -- There's this reporter who's ben making my life a living hell ... If he comes by here, don't talk to him.  And whatever yo do.... (crosses to Gill) ... Don't show him that picture of me at the concert in San Francisco -- 
Suddenly, a loud CHUCKLING emanates from the car overhead. 
MAGGIE (cont'd) What was that? 
Maggie stops Gill from playing.  She shoots her ex an angry glare and moves a lever on the shop wall.  With a HUM, the car descends. 
GILL We went to San Francisco twice. Remember one time we had a flat tire... Which picture? 
As the hydraulic lift slows, the car is lowered, revealing Ike sitting in the driver's seat.  He has been enjoying the photograph he's holding. 
IKE (feigning shock) Imagine!  Maggie Carpenter topless in a public arena. (checks photo again) And I see there was a chill in the air. 
Maggie swipes for the photo, but Ike is faster at pulling it away. 
MAGGIE Give me that! 
IKE But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back. 
Gill takes off his guitar and sets it down. 
GILL Ike bet me fifty bucks you don't still have it, Mags.  I said "You're on, man! Maggie loved that thing!"  And I could really use fifty bucks. 
Maggie is conspicuously silent. 
GILL (cont'd) (looking worried) Mags? 
MAGGIE I'm not gonna show you guys anything. I am a soon-to-be-married woman.  Now give me that photograph. 
Maggie seethes. 
IKE Sure, I would love to give this to you. Just give us one quick gander at that rose, and, I'll gladly hand it over. 
She tries to grab the photo again.  Ike pulls it away. 
MAGGIE Fine.  Here. 
Maggie quickly turns around and pulls down the back of her shirt, revealing the top of her back and a pristine expanse of skin.  No tattoo. 
MAGGIE (cont'd) (turning back around) Satisfied? 
IKE Completely. 
Gill is still trying to grasp the meaning of this. 
GILL Maggie?  You got it removed?

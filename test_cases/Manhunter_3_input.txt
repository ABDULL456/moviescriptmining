Dr. Princi joins them. 
SPRINGFIELD (to Graham) The Commissioner was saying you were the one that caught Dr. Lecter three years ago. (beat) He killed nine people, didn't he? 
GRAHAM Nine that we know of. Two didn't die. 
SPRINGFIELD What happened to them? 
GRAHAM One's on the respirator at a hospital in Baltimore. The other is in a private mental hospital in Denver. 
SPRINGFIELD What did the psychologists say was wrong with Lecter? 
GRAHAM Psychologists call him a sociopath. They don't know what else to call him. 
SPRINGFIELD What would you call him? 
Graham doesn't answer. 
SPRINGFIELD To yourself... 
GRAHAM I call him a monster. 
SPRINGFIELD I understand he cut you pretty good... 
GRAHAM (cold right turn> What about the dog? 
SPRINGFIELD It's at the vet's. The kids brought it in with a puncture wound in the abdomen. icepick or an awl. 
GRAHAM Was the dog wearing a collar with the Leeds' name on it? 
SPRINGFIELD No. 
GRAHAM Did the Jacobis in Birmingham have a dog? 
CRAWFORD (alert) A cat. We found a litter box downstairs but not the cat. Neighbors are watching for it. 
GRAHAM Why don't you get Birmingham P.D. a methane probe out of D.C. and have them cover the backyard... maybe the cat's dead and the kids buried it. 
Crawford starts to move. The PHONE RINGS. Springfield answers. SPRINGFIELD Yeah? (waits) Lemme put you on the speaker phone. 
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) Who am I talking to? 
CRAWIIORD Jimmie, it's me, Jack Crawford, and you got Will Graham here. 
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) I got a partial with a tented arch that's probably a thumb print and a fragment of a palm. 
Springfield reacts. 
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) Came off the oldest kid's left eye. It stood out against an eight-ball hemorrhage from the gunshot wound. 
CRAWFORD Can you make an identification off it? 
JIMMIE PRICE (V.O.) Don't know. The palm came off the nail of Mrs. Leeds' left big toe. I want to work these up in my own darkroom. I'll fax the prints down to you this afternoon. Hangs up. 
SPRINGFIELD thought Graham was ridiculous. Now his expression is very changed. 
GRAHAM 
senses Springfield's staring at him. Graham's face is blank. He leaves. Springfield -- shaking Crawford's hand -- watches Graham all the way to the door. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ATLANTA POLICE HEADQUARTERS - GRAHAM s CRAWFORD - DAY 
coming down the stairs. News media are all over Springfield, the Commissioner, the Mayor's P.R. Officer in the b.g. No- body recognizes Crawford and Graham except one short man, who separates himself from the pack and darts up to them. He is LOUNDS. He starts chasing behind them. 
LOUNDS Will Graham! Remember me? Freddie Lounds? I covered the Lecter case for the Tattler. I did the paperback... ! 
CLOSE: GRAHAM 
walking down the stairs. His face is locked like a steel trap. He's repressing something powerful. 
LOUNDS (running on, behind them) When did they call you in, Will? What have you got? 
Graham won't answer him. They are on the sidewalk by now. 
CRAWFORD Lounds, give it a rest... 
LOUNDS Come on, Graham?! Talk to me! 
Graham and Crawford are moving dawn the sidewalk now. Crawford tries to block Lounds. Lounds moves around him, dogging Graham: 
LOUNDS How does this guy compare with Lecter? How does he do them? 
Right now he makes the mistake of grabbing Graham's arm to turn him around. 
GRAHAM 
Grabs Lounds by the labels, kicks his legs out from under him and throws him over the hood of a car upside-down. The impact STARS the WINDSHIELD Lounds is scared to death. The violence totally surprises us. Graham's face is inches from Lounds. 
GRAHAM (very low) Keep the fuck away from me! 
Crawford is pulling on Graham. He can't budge him. Graham lets go. 
WIDER: CRAWFORD PULLING GRAHAM AWAY

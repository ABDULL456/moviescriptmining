264	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
SCIENTIST About nine minutes. 
President Lindberg has trouble breathing. 
265	INT.  TEMPLE 
Lit by torches, Korben sets Leeloo delicately on the altar in the exact center of the four elements.  Cornelius looks over the four Stones every which way. 
CORNELIUS (panic-stricken) Uh, this one... must be water! 
It's obvious he doesn't know where to put it. 
KORBEN Don't tell me you don't know how all this works? 
CORNELIUS Theoretically, yes! The four Stones form the beam and the Fifth Element is supposed to stand in the middle there, but... I don't have the reference book. I've never seen the Stones work! 
Korben can't believe his ears.  He tears the Stone out of Cornelius' hand and studies the inscriptions.  He goes over to one of the four bases the stones rest on and tries to figure it out.  The symbol of air is on the Stone, the same as on the base. 
KORBEN Match the symbols! 
Korben places the first Stone and picks up another one.  Cornelius has found the symbol for water.  Loc Rhod sits down.  He is very tired. 
LOC RHOD What is this some kinda game? Like chess? 
Korben pulls him to his feet and sticks a Stone in his hands. 
KORBEN No. It's much simpler. If we don't figure out where these Stones go in five minutes, we're all dead! Think you got it? 
Loc Rhod's got it and runs over to put in his Stone.  The four Stones are all in place but nothing happens. 
KORBEN There's no light! You told me there were supposed to be four beams of light. 
CORNELIUS (lost) Yes, of course, but... The Stones are shut! They have to be open for it to work. 
KORBEN And you don't know how they open, is that what you are saying? 
CORNELIUS That's what I'm saying. 
266	EXT.  SPACE 
The Dark Planet closes in on Earth rapidly. 
267	INT.  CHAPEL 
Korben leans over Leeloo. 
KORBEN Leeloo? The Stones! We have to open them! How does it work? 
LEELOO (feeble) The wind blows... the fire burns... 
KORBEN I know all that, Leeloo! I'm talking about the Stones. 
LEELOO ...The rain falls... 
Korben is desperate.  Leeloo's too weak, he won't get anything more out of her. He darts over to a Stone and turns it over and over. 
KORBEN The rain falls... the wind blows? 
Loc Rhod stands in front of his Stone looking at Korben. 
KORBEN Try and figure out how this fucking thing opens, instead of staring at me like that! 
Loc Rhod starts feeling the Stone all around. 
LOC RHOD (afraid) I'm looking, I'm looking. 
268	INT.  PRESIDENT'S  OFFICE 
The tension is palpable in the President's office. 
SCIENTIST ...Three minutes. 
MUNRO We've lost contact with them. 
269	INT.  CHAPEL 
Korben and Cornelius turn the Stones every which way.  All to no avai1. Loc Rhod is discouraged. 
LOC RHOD ...we'll never make it. 
He sighs.  Three hooks pop off the Stone.  Loc Rhod can't believe his eyes. 
LOC RHOD It... it moved! Korben! Korben! 
Korben rushes over, looks at the Stone.  Hooks are undone. 
KORBEN What did you say? What did you do? 
LOC RHOD Nothing! Swear to God, I didn't do nothing! 
KORBEN Look, you did something that set it off. Try to remember. Concentrate. Tell me exactly what you did!! 
Loc Rhod tries to duplicate the same movement. 
LOC RHOD I was like this... With my hands here and... I said, "We'll never make it!" That's all!

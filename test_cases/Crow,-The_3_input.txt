SPEEG I hate this cream stuff.  They can't even call it cream, legally. 
They snap to as the T-Bird blazes past, doing ninety. 
MJ What in the crap? 
MJ floors the pedal, drenching Speeg in coffee on takeoff. 
SPEEG Ow! Owowoowowoowo, goddammit! 
EXT. STREET - ON ALLEY - NIGHT 
as the cruiser roars out to give chase. 
INT. T-BIRD - TRAVELLING FAST - NIGHT 
Eric lends the chase car a backward look. 
ERIC You caught one.  Drive faster. 
T-BIRD Man, you gonna get us killed dead and I don't even know what you want! 
Eric cocks T_Bird's pistol and levels it at his face. 
ERIC I want you to stop talking.  And drive.  Drive faster. 
Eric rifles the glove box, tossing items out the window: clips for the gun.  Sunglasses.  A giant dildo (brief eyebrows-up to T-Bird).  Then: a roll of (previously established) gaffer's tape.  What Eric needs. 
ANGLE - T-BIRD AND REARVIEW MIRROR 
as he sees a second cop car join the high speed pursuit, 
ERIC (CONT'D) You're very popular.  Thought you could handle this thing. 
T-Bird macho calcifies.  He's going to win. 
T-BIRD To hell with you. 
ERIC (wry) Naturally. 
INSERT - SPEEDOMETER 
Climbing swiftly toward the 100 mark. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - VARIOUS ANGLES - THE CHASE - NIGHT 
A 3-way pursuit until the T-Bird reaches the outskirts of the city. 
EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT 
All quiet... until the T-Bird ZOOMS past frame.  The lead cop tries to duplicate the T-Bird's corner-cut and starts spinning. It clips a light pole.  Rebounds into the path of MJ's unit. 
INT. POLICE CRUISER - ON SPEEG AND MJ - TRAVELING - NIGHT 
as MJ stands on the brakes.  Collision imminent.  They howl. 
EXT. DOCKSIDE STREET - NIGHT 
as MJ's unit broadsides the first cop car. 
EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT 
The T-bird careens through dockside silence, alone, then fishtails, SCREECHING, to a lung-compressing halt. 
INT. T-BIRD - ON ERIC AND T-BIRD - NIGHT 
T-bird respirating like a jackhammer.  Eric holds stoic. 
T-BIRD So what -- you gonna rape me now? 
ERIC Time for your reward, T.  Payback with interest earned. 
Eric rips a long strip of tape from the roll. 
EXT. DETROIT RIVER SHIPYARD - NIGHT 
A HIGH ANGLE of the car as Eric opens the trunk. 
ERIC'S POV - The Trunk. 
loaded with plastique, canisters, timers, arson paraphernalia. 
INT. T-BIRD - FAVOR T-BIRD - NIGHT 
SLOW TILT starting with T-Bird's foot, firmly taped to the pedal.  Mummified into his seat.  Hands taped to the wheel. Throat taped hard against the headrest. 
The car is now in gear, idling. 
ANGLE - ON ERIC FROM WINDOW

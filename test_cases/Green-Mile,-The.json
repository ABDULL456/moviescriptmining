Made it race against time...Once I built a railroad, now it's done...Brother, can you spare a dime... \nOpening credit sequence \nplays against footage of the Great Depression, images haunting and sepia-toned, defining an era. The bread lines...the soup kitchens...the dust bowl refugees heading west with their possessions on their backs and no hope in their eyes...the strutting gangster royalty flaunting their bootleg riches...an entire generation of lost youth riding the rials...the U.S. army troops raining truncheon blows on the half-starved and forgotten veterans of World War One as \"Hooverville\" is set afire in the very shadow of the nation's capitol... \nAll these faces, all these lives, in a world not really so very long ago... \nEXT. FIELD - DAY(SLOW MOTION) \n...where cattails sway in the sepia-toned heat. A small scrap of fabric is snagged in the nettles, fluttering languidly... \nCOLOR BLEEDS SLOWLY IN as mosquitoes swarm and dragonflies skitter, showing the fabric scrap to be pale yellow... \nSuddenly, a MAN WITH A SHOTGUN comes crashing through the cattails, wiping through frame and exiting... \n...then ANOTHER MAN...and ANOTHER...armed with rifles, plowing through the brush, exiting frame... \n...and now comes KLAUS DETTERICK, a farmer one step above shirt-tail poor, a double-barrel shotgun in the crook of his arm. He pauses, horrified, seeing the scrap of cloth. He pulls it loose, turns back, screaming something in anguish... \n...and still more men come crashing into view, flooding by us with dreamlike, slow-motion grace. ONE MAN is leading a team of DOGS, trying to untangle the leads. DEPUTY ROB McGEE is shouting for everybody to stay together... \n...and under it all, we hear a sibilant, frightening whisper: \nWHISPERING VOICE (V.O.) You love your sister? You make any noise, know what happens? \nAnd off that horrible voice, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. GEORGIA PINES NURSING HOME - MORNING(PRESENT DAY) \nA CLOCK RADIO spews the morning weather report, abruptly pulling us into the present with a prediction of rain. PAUL EDGECOMB, late 70's/early 80's, wakes to another day... \nINT. PAUL'S ROOM - MORNING \nPaul stands at his bathroom mirror, meticulously buttoning his shirt. He picks up a hairbrush, starts tidying his hair... \nINT. CORRIDOR - MORNING \nTHE OLD AND INFIRM haunt these corridors like ghosts. A WOMAN inches along on a walker. A MAN shuffles by with a rolling I.V. stand. The floor is a limey, institutional green. \nPaul comes into view, spry for his age, murmurs an occasional greeting. \nINT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING \nDOZENS OF RETIREES are having breakfast, sipping weak coffee or tea. Some chat and gossip, other are content to keep their own company, some just stare slackly into space. \nPaul enters, sees ELAINE CONNELLY sitting with a few other ladies, sipping tea. She's 80, refined and elegant, his best friend here. She gives him a good-morning smile. He gives her a rakish wink in return, which makes her smiles all the more. \nPaul reaches past the people at the counter and sneaks two pieces of cold leftover toast off a serving plate. He tosses Elaine another look--catch ya later--and exits. \nINT. HALLWAY PAST KITCHEN - MORNING \nPaul slips to the back door unnoticed. Identical red plastic rain ponchos line the wall on pegs. He helps himself to one and eases outside, making good his escape. \nEXT. NURSING HOME - ESTABLISHING - MORNING \nNestled in a valley of wooded hills, a drizzly mist rolling over the treetops. \nPaul appears f.g., coming up the ridge in his borrowed poncho. He looks back at the valley below, inhales deeply-- this is a man who loves his walks. \nHe pulls a piece of toast from his pocket and starts to nibble as he presses up on the ridge... \nLow angle: nursing home and ridge beyond \n...and we see Paul from a distance, just a speck trudging up toward the treeline. A PICKUP TRUCK rumbles into frame and parks, a bumper sticker looming large: \"I Have Seen God and His Name Is Newt Gingrich\". \nBRAD DOLAN gets out, an orderly in his late 20's/early 30's, arriving for work in jeans and cheesy plaid shirt. He gazes up toward the ridge, scowling and muttering softly: \nBRAD Old fuck. \nHe slams the door and heads for the nursing home... \nEXT. WOODS - MORNING \n...as CAMERA BOOMS DOWN through the trees to find Paul wandering a wooded path, munching a tidbit of toast, looking for all the world like Red Riding Hood in his plastic poncho. \nIt's silent here, like a church. The only sounds we hear are the twittering of the birds and the hammering of the woodpecker. \nA RUSTLING SOUND makes Paul freeze. He turns, becomes transfixed. Softly: \nPAUL Oh, my... \nReverse angle \nreveals a magnificent BUCK, not twenty feet away, misty breath punching the cold morning air. They watch each other for an endless moment, both standing stock still... \n...and then the animal bounds away, vanishing into the foliage. Paul lets out a breath, shakes his head in wonder. He takes another bite of toast, moves on... \n", "test1_true": "INT. SHACK - MORNING \nDark in here, cobwebby and decrepit. We see Paul approaching outside the grimy window. He steps up to the glass and shades his eyes, peering curiously in as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. NURSING HOME - DAY \nPaul approaches the back door, returning from his walk. He reaches for the knob...and a figure in white lunges from behind the dumpster to grab his wrist. He whirls, gasping in fright--it's Brad Dolan, wearing his orderly's uniform. \nBRAD Out for a little stroll, Paulie? \nPAUL Let go... \nPaul tries to pull away, but Dolan's got him tight. \nBRAD What's with this poncho you got on, huh? This isn't yours. \nPAUL I got it off the wall there. There's a whole row of them. \nBRAD But not for you, Paulie, that's the thing. Those are for the staff. \nPAUL I just borrowed it. Don't see what harm it does. \nBRAD It's not about harm, it's about rules. You probably don't think an old fart like you has to mind rules anymore, but that's just not true. \nBrad's eyes keep shifting--he obviously doesn't mind abusing the elderly as long as he doesn't get caught doing it. \nPAUL I'm sorry if I broke the rules. \nBRAD You got no business up in those woods anyway, especially in the rain. What if you fall and bust a hip, huh? Who you think's gonna have to hoss your sorry old bacon back down here? Me, that's who. \nPAUL You're hurting me! \nBRAD What do you do up there, anyway? You're too old to go jerk off, so what do you do? \nPAUL Nothing. I just walk, that's all, I like to walk! \nBrad lashes out and grabs Paul's other hand, which he's been holding tightly clenched shut. \nBRAD Come on. Open up. Let Poppa see. \nPaul uncurls his fingers, revealing the crushed remnants of a bit of toast, his palm slick with a greasy oleo smear. \nELAINE (O.S.) Paul? \nThey turn. Elaine stands just inside the screen door with a cup of tea. Brad's eyes become calculated, wondering how much she's seen. Elaine keeps her tone level, betraying nothing: \nELAINE I saw you coming back, thought you'd like some tea. (beat) Are you coming in? \nPAUL Mr. Dolan and I were...chatting. About the weather. I think we're through now. \nBrad lets Paul loose, leans close: \nBRAD Paulie? You tell anyone I squeezed your po' ol' hand, I'll tell 'em you're having senile delusions. Who you think they'll believe? \nBrad walks off. Paul turns, watches him go. The screen door opens and Elaine steps out, her face pale. Paul gives her a strained, though grateful, smile as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. TV ROOM - DAY \nJerry Springer's on the tube, whipping his studio audience into a frenzy. PAN OFF TO REVEAL DOZENS OF OLD FOLKS watching on couches and folding chairs. An old black fellow named PETE is grousing to a GROUP OF ELDERLY LADIES... \nPETE Why we always watch this crap? \nELDERLY LADY #1 It's interesting. \nPETE Interesting? Bunch'a inbred trailer trash, all they ever talk about is fucking... \n...and WE CONTINUE PANNING to Paul and Elaine sitting near the back, talking quietly as Paul rubs his bruised hand: \nELAINE We should report him. \nPAUL That might just provoke him all the more, make things worse for everybody. \nELAINE It's not everybody he has it in for, Paul. It's you. (off his look) What did you do to provoke him in the first place? Nothing. He's just an abusive bully, and should be made to stop. \nPAUL Ellie, please... \nPete \nis at the TV, switching channels while: \nELDERLY LADIES ...no, the Movie Classic channel is further down...past the Home Shopping...keep going... \nHe finds the Movie Classic channel, which is playing an old black and white musical--\"Top Hat,\" with Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. A delighted reaction: \nELDERLY LADY #2 Oh! This is wonderful... \nPaul \nidly shifts his gaze to the TV...and his expression goes slack with recognition and dismay. Elaine sees the look in his eyes. \nHe glances away...even briefly considers walking out...but in the end, he can't help himself. The past just caught up with him with a freight-train wallop, and, for one, he decides to ride the rails... \nHe looks back at the TV. On screen, Fred and Ginger have begun their famous \"Cheek to Cheek\" number, with Astaire singing in that sublime, easy-go-lucky way of his: \nFRED ASTAIRE Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my heart beat so that I can hardly speak... \n", "test1_id": 2373, "test2_input": "Coffey shakes his head. Harry steps out. \nPAUL My name is Paul Edgecomb. If I'm not here, you can ask for Mr. Terwilliger, Mr. Howell, or Mr. Stanton...those gentlemen there. (beat) This isn't like the rest of the prison. It's a quiet place, we like to keep it that way. \nCoffey considers this carefully, puzzled. \nCOFFEY It weren't me making all the noise, boss. \nPAUL (eyes narrowing) You having a joke on me, John Coffey? \nCOFFEY No, sir. \nPaul sees he isn't joking, continues: \nPAUL Your time here can be easy or hard, depends on you. If you behave, you get to walk in the exercise yard every day. \nWe might even play some music on the radio from time to time. Questions? \nCoffey doesn't miss a beat, as if he's been waiting to ask: \nCOFFEY Do you leave a light on after bedtime? \nPaul blinks. It's the last thing he expected. Coffey smiles uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking. \nCOFFEY Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes. If it's a strange place. \nPaul looks to his men. The guards are trading glances. \nPAUL It's pretty bright in here all night long. We keep half the lights burning in the corridor. \nCOFFEY Cor'der. \nCoffey looks confused. Paul points to the lights lining the ceiling of the Green Mile in wire mesh cages. \nPAUL Right out there. \nCoffey nods, relieved. Then he surprises everybody by offering Paul his hand, as if to show proper manners. Paul hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even more by accepting. Coffey's hand swallows his. Coffey shakes gently, lets go. \nPaul steps from the cell. Brutal slides the door shut, locks it. Coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do, then sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees. He looks up at Paul, his voice soft as a whisper: \nCOFFEY Couldn't help it, boss. I tried to take it back, but it was too late. \nPaul turns, leads his men up the Mile... \nPAUL'S INNER OFFICE \n...and they enter a few moments later. Paul is furious, but keeping a lid on his temper: \nPAUL Dean, run Delacroix up to the infirmary and see if his fingers are broken. \nBRUTAL Course they're broken, I heard the damn bones crack. Goddamn Percy. \nHARRY You hear what he was yelling when we brought the big dummy in? \nPAUL How could I miss it, Harry? The whole prison heard. \nThis makes Brutal snort, breaking the tension--the others can't help smiling. \nBRUTAL You'll probably have to answer for sending him off the Mile. He's gonna cause you trouble over this, you mark me. \nPAUL I'll chew that food when I have to. Right now I wanna hear about the new inmate...aside from how big he is, okay? \nBRUTAL (smiles) Monstrous big. Damn. \nPAUL Seems meek enough. Looks like they sent us an imbecile to execute. \nHARRY Imbecile or not, he deserves to fry for what he done. Here... \nHarry tosses a pair of manila envelopes bound with rubber bands on the desk before Paul--Coffey's file. \nHARRY ...make your blood curdle. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. E BLOCK PRISON YARD - DAY \nA small are reserved for inmates of the Mile, fenced-off from the main prison yard. Arlen Bitterbuck walks the perimeter under the watchful eyes of guard BILL DODGE. \nWe find Paul sitting by himself on the bleachers with Coffey's file on his knees, thoughtfully unwrapping his brown- bagged sandwich. PUSH SLOWLY IN as he begins to read... \nEXT. DETTERICK FARM - DAWN (FLASHBACK) \n...and we see Klaus Detterick walk from his house to the barn with a milking pail, a solitary figure against a brightening horizon. He disappears into the barn... \n...and we hold for a long moment, the house silent b.g.,chickens clucking and scratching in the front yard... \n...until a WOMAN'S SCREAM shatters the silence. Klaus reappears, dropping the pail, running toward the house... \nPAUL ON BLEACHERS \n...as Paul turns the page, keeps reading... \nINT. DETTERICK HOUSE - DAWN (FLASHBACK) \n...and Klaus bursts in to find his wife MARJORIE absolutely frantic with terror: \nKLAUS WHAT? GOD SAKES, WHAT? \nMARJORIE THE GIRLS! THE GIRLS ARE GONE! \nShe drags him through the house to a screened-off porch area where their 12 year old son HOWIE is pointing and shouting-- \n", "test2_true": "--and Klaus freezes there, stunned to see blood spattered on the floor and the screen door hanging off its hinges... \nKLAUS Oh my God. \nPAUL ON BLEACHERS \n...as Paul absently takes another bite of his sandwich, not really tasting it, keeps reading... \nINT. DETTERICK HOUSE - DAWN (FLASHBACK) \n...plunging us back into the screaming chaos: Klaus grabbing up shotgun shells, Howie loading the .22 rifle he got for Christmas, Marjorie sobbing incoherently... \nKLAUS GODDAMN IT, WOMAN, GET ON THE PHONE NOW! YOU TELL 'EM WE HEADED WEST! MIND WHAT I'M SAYING! WEST, Y'HEAR? \n...and she goes stumbling through the house, grabbing for the phone as her men disappear toward the porch b.g.: \nMARJORIE Central! Central, are you on the line? Oh, God, please, somebody took my little girls... \nOUTSIDE THE HOUSE \nKlaus and his son race from the house, following spatters of blood across the yard... \nPAUL ON THE BLEACHERS \n...as Paul lets out a long breath, turns the page... \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD/FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK) \n---and we see CARS AND TRUCKS pulling up, MEN jumping out with rifles, pouring down the incline toward the field where Klaus is hollering and waving his arms. Deputy McGee comes sliding down from the road, taking charge at the top of his lungs-- \nMcGEE I WANT ALL THE WEAPONS UNLOADED, Y'HEAR? TAKE OUT YOUR SHELLS, I WON'T HAVE A MAN SHOT BY ACCIDENT TODAY! BOBO, WHERE THEM DOGS? \n--and the dogs come bounding out of the back of a truck, howling down the incline to lead the chase... \nVARIOUS ANGLES \n...which takes us through the cattails and bulrushes...to the spot where Klaus finds the little scrap of pale yellow fabric, turns and screams... \nKLAUS Oh, Lord, this belongs to my Katie... \n...and they keep going, stopping abruptly as they find: A blood-drenched area of tramped grass. A little girl's bloody nightgown hangs in the low branches of a tree. Some of these strong men look like they might throw up or faint at the sight of it. Their blood freezes in their veins as an INHUMAN HOWLING commences up ahead. It's like nothing they've ever heard before, raising the hackles of men and dogs alike. \nPAUL ON BLEACHERS \n...as Paul quietly turns another page, shaking his head... \nPAUL Jesus. \nEXT. FIELD - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nThe men reload their weapons. Everybody's terrified. McGee starts off, the other following his lead toward-- \nTHE RIVER \n--where they emerge from the treeline, drawing ever closer to the source of that INHUMAN HOWLING... \n...and they stop, gazing in horror: \nJohn Coffey sits on the riverbank in bloody overalls, his huge feet splayed out before him. He's making that inhuman howling sound, face twisted in monstrous grief, pausing occasionally to take in a great hitching breath of air. \nCurled in his massive arms are the naked bodies of Detterick's 9 year-old twin girls, their once-blonde hair now matted to their heads with blood. \nA tableau. The men staring. John Coffey howling. A train puffing smoke across the landscape. \nKlaus Detterick breaks the moment, lunging down the riverbank in a headlong rush. The others try to grab him, but he shrugs them off and throws himself on Coffey with a scream of inarticulate rage, kicking and punching, fists flying. Coffey barely seems to notice. \nThe others catch up with Klaus, drag him off. He falls to his knees on the riverbank, sobbing into his hands. Howie runs to him, throws himself into his father's arm. They hug each other tightly, overwhelmed with grief. \nA semblance of quiet descends, except for Coffey's heartbroken wailing. A ring of rifle toting men forms around him, though he hardly seems aware of it. McGee steps forward, uncertain: \nMcGEE Mister. \nCoffey goes quiet at once, eyes still streaming tears. \nMcGEE Mister? Can you hear me? (Coffey nods) You have a name? \nCOFFEY John Coffey. Like the drink, only not spelt the same. \nMcGee hunkers carefully down, watching for any sudden moves. \nMcGEE What happened here, John Coffey? You want to tell me that? \nCOFFEY I couldn't help it. I tried to take it back, but it was too late. \nMcGEE (pause) Boy, you are under arrest for murder. \nMcGee spits in Coffey's face... \nPAUL ON BLEACHERS \n...as Paul looks up with a slight start, jarred from his reading to find WARDEN HAL MOORES standing before him. \nHAL I interrupt? \nPAUL I'm just about done. \nPaul stows the file as Hal settles onto the bleachers. \nPAUL How's that pretty gal of yours? \n", "test2_id": 2374, "test3_input": "THE MEN (various, ad-lib) Ma'am, you sure know how to fry up some fine chicken...Brutal, don't hog the taters now...Try that corn yet? It's something special... \nPaul softly interjects: \nPAUL You saw what he did with the mouse. \nThis stops everybody cold. Dean puts his chicken down, wipes his hands. Looks are traded in the silence. \nBRUTAL I could'a gone the rest of the day without you bringing that up. \nDEAN I could'a gone the rest of the year. \nPAUL He did it to me too. He put his hands on me and took my bladder infection away. \nThe men absorb this. Brutal glances to Jan. \nJAN When he came home, he was...all better. \nDEAN You're talking about an authentic healing. A praise-Jesus miracle. \nPAUL I am. \nBRUTAL If you say it, I accept it. But what's it got to do with us? \nJan looks to Paul, realization starting to dawn: \nJAN Melinda? Oh, Paul... \nBRUTAL Melinda? Melinda Moores? \nPaul nods--that's who we're talking about. \nJAN You really think you can help her? \nPAUL It's not a bladder infection, or even a busted-up mouse. But there might be a chance. \nHARRY Hold on now. You're talking about our jobs. Sneak a sick woman onto a cellblock? \nPAUL Hal would never allow that. You know him, he wouldn't believe something unless it fell on him. \nBRUTAL So you're talking about taking John Coffey to her. That's more than just our jobs, Paul. \nDEAN Damn right. That's prison time if we get caught. \nHARRY Let's not discuss this like it's even an option. Brutal, help me out here... \nBrutal lets out a deep breath, considering. He looks to Paul. \nBRUTAL I'm sure she's a fine woman... \nJAN The finest. \nPAUL What's happening to her is an offense, Brutal. To the eyes and the ears and the heart. \nBRUTAL I have no doubt. But we don't know her like you and Jan do...do we? \nPAUL That's why it's a lot to ask. \nHARRY It is. Let's not forget Coffey's a murderer. What if he escapes? I'd hate losing my job or going to prison, but I'd hate having a dead child on my conscience even more. \nPAUL I don't think that'll happen... (beat, softly) ...in fact, I don't think he did it at all. \nThe men are stunned by this. Off their looks: \nPAUL I just can't see God putting a gift like that in the hands of a man who would kill a child. \nDEAN Well, that's a tender notion, but the man's on death row for the crime. Plus, he's huge. If he tried to get away, it'd take a lot of bullets to stop him. \nBRUTAL We'd all have shotguns in addition to sidearms. I'd insist on that. (to Paul) He tried anything, we'd have to take him down. You understand. \nPAUL I understand. \nBRUTAL (beat) So.

INFIRMARY BUILDING/DISPENSARY - NIGHT \nA FLASHLIGHT BEAM plays across a glass cabinet, scanning the contents. The beam pauses. A hand enters frame, unlocks the cabinet, pulls out a bottle of morphine tablets... \n...and WE ANGLE TO Brutal as he shakes half a dozen pills onto his palm, pockets them, replaces the bottle on the shelf. He turns and slips five bucks to a NIGHTSHIFT ORDERLY. \nBRUTAL I was never here. \nORDERLY Shit, for five bucks, you was never nowhere. \nINT.

Hey, I'm'a get some too. \nBRUTAL My ass you get some too. \nPAUL You think you deserve any? \nHARRY (checks a clipboard) Day report says he's been okay. \nBILLY Hell, yes, I been behaved. C'mon, now, don't be stingy hogs. \nPaul shrugs to Brutal--why not? Brutal pops the top off a bottle, passes it to Paul. Paul grabs a tin cup, sets it on the desk...and we see it contains the morphine powder. He pours the cola, swirls it around... \nANGLE THROUGH COFFEY'S BARS \n...as Coffey looks up, sensing something happening. He peers up the Mile as Paul walks to: \nBILLY'S CELL \nBilly reaches for the cup, but Paul keeps it out of reach. \nPAUL You gonna stay behaved? \nBILLY C'mon, you clunk, gimme that. \nPAUL You promise me, or I'll drink it myself right here in front of you. \nBILLY C'mon now, don't be that way.

(off their looks) So? We gonna do this? \nA voice comes softly from down the way: \nCOFFEY Sure. I'd like to take a ride. \nTheir heads come slowly around, staring at Coffey in shock. \nBRUTAL (to Paul) Guess were all in. \nINT. PAUL'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nPercy looks up from his book as the door opens. Paul enters with Brutal and Harry, ominously hemming the desk. \nPERCY What is this? \nPaul pulls the canvas straitjacket from behind his back. \nPAUL Payback. \nPercy jumps up and tries to the execution chamber, but Harry grabs him, spins him back. A wild scuffle ensues as: \nPERCY Let go of me! Let go! \nPAUL Settle down, Percy! \nPercy tries to jerk away, crashes into the desk. The book he was reading falls to the floor-- \n--and a \"Tijuana Bible\" is revealed within the pages. It's a pornographic cartoon book of the type popular in the '30's, featuring crude drawings of famous cartoon characters or movie stars engaged in outlandish sexual acts. This one has Olive Oyl getting it doggy-style from Popeye. The word balloon over his head features his famous laugh: \"Uk-uk-uk- uk!\" \nBRUTAL Oooo, Poicy!

And you can't make me. \nBRUTAL You're dead wrong about that, you know. \nBrutal grabs Percy by the ears, twisting hard. Percy lets out a shriek--not just of pain, but a dismayed understanding that he's not going to bluster his way out of this one. \nBRUTAL You gonna put your arms up? I'll rip your ears off. Use 'em for tea caddies. You know I will. \nPAUL The man's ripping your ears off, Percy. I'd do as he says. \nPercy jerks his arms up before him. They get the straitjacket on him within seconds.

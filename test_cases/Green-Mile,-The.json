Made it race against time...Once I built a railroad, now it's done...Brother, can you spare a dime... \nOpening credit sequence \nplays against footage of the Great Depression, images haunting and sepia-toned, defining an era. The bread lines...the soup kitchens...the dust bowl refugees heading west with their possessions on their backs and no hope in their eyes...the strutting gangster royalty flaunting their bootleg riches...an entire generation of lost youth riding the rials...the U.S. army troops raining truncheon blows on the half-starved and forgotten veterans of World War One as \"Hooverville\" is set afire in the very shadow of the nation's capitol... \nAll these faces, all these lives, in a world not really so very long ago... \nEXT. FIELD - DAY(SLOW MOTION) \n...where cattails sway in the sepia-toned heat. A small scrap of fabric is snagged in the nettles, fluttering languidly... \nCOLOR BLEEDS SLOWLY IN as mosquitoes swarm and dragonflies skitter, showing the fabric scrap to be pale yellow... \nSuddenly, a MAN WITH A SHOTGUN comes crashing through the cattails, wiping through frame and exiting... \n...then ANOTHER MAN...and ANOTHER...armed with rifles, plowing through the brush, exiting frame... \n...and now comes KLAUS DETTERICK, a farmer one step above shirt-tail poor, a double-barrel shotgun in the crook of his arm. He pauses, horrified, seeing the scrap of cloth. He pulls it loose, turns back, screaming something in anguish... \n...and still more men come crashing into view, flooding by us with dreamlike, slow-motion grace. ONE MAN is leading a team of DOGS, trying to untangle the leads. DEPUTY ROB McGEE is shouting for everybody to stay together... \n...and under it all, we hear a sibilant, frightening whisper: \nWHISPERING VOICE (V.O.) You love your sister? You make any noise, know what happens? \nAnd off that horrible voice, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. GEORGIA PINES NURSING HOME - MORNING(PRESENT DAY) \nA CLOCK RADIO spews the morning weather report, abruptly pulling us into the present with a prediction of rain. PAUL EDGECOMB, late 70's/early 80's, wakes to another day... \nINT. PAUL'S ROOM - MORNING \nPaul stands at his bathroom mirror, meticulously buttoning his shirt. He picks up a hairbrush, starts tidying his hair... \nINT. CORRIDOR - MORNING \nTHE OLD AND INFIRM haunt these corridors like ghosts. A WOMAN inches along on a walker. A MAN shuffles by with a rolling I.V. stand. The floor is a limey, institutional green. \nPaul comes into view, spry for his age, murmurs an occasional greeting. \nINT. BREAKFAST ROOM - MORNING \nDOZENS OF RETIREES are having breakfast, sipping weak coffee or tea. Some chat and gossip, other are content to keep their own company, some just stare slackly into space. \nPaul enters, sees ELAINE CONNELLY sitting with a few other ladies, sipping tea. She's 80, refined and elegant, his best friend here. She gives him a good-morning smile. He gives her a rakish wink in return, which makes her smiles all the more. \nPaul reaches past the people at the counter and sneaks two pieces of cold leftover toast off a serving plate. He tosses Elaine another look--catch ya later--and exits. \nINT. HALLWAY PAST KITCHEN - MORNING \nPaul slips to the back door unnoticed. Identical red plastic rain ponchos line the wall on pegs. He helps himself to one and eases outside, making good his escape. \nEXT. NURSING HOME - ESTABLISHING - MORNING \nNestled in a valley of wooded hills, a drizzly mist rolling over the treetops. \nPaul appears f.g., coming up the ridge in his borrowed poncho. He looks back at the valley below, inhales deeply-- this is a man who loves his walks. \nHe pulls a piece of toast from his pocket and starts to nibble as he presses up on the ridge... \nLow angle: nursing home and ridge beyond \n...and we see Paul from a distance, just a speck trudging up toward the treeline. A PICKUP TRUCK rumbles into frame and parks, a bumper sticker looming large: \"I Have Seen God and His Name Is Newt Gingrich\". \nBRAD DOLAN gets out, an orderly in his late 20's/early 30's, arriving for work in jeans and cheesy plaid shirt. He gazes up toward the ridge, scowling and muttering softly: \nBRAD Old fuck. \nHe slams the door and heads for the nursing home... \nEXT. WOODS - MORNING \n...as CAMERA BOOMS DOWN through the trees to find Paul wandering a wooded path, munching a tidbit of toast, looking for all the world like Red Riding Hood in his plastic poncho. \nIt's silent here, like a church. The only sounds we hear are the twittering of the birds and the hammering of the woodpecker. \nA RUSTLING SOUND makes Paul freeze. He turns, becomes transfixed. Softly: \nPAUL Oh, my... \nReverse angle \nreveals a magnificent BUCK, not twenty feet away, misty breath punching the cold morning air. They watch each other for an endless moment, both standing stock still... \n...and then the animal bounds away, vanishing into the foliage. Paul lets out a breath, shakes his head in wonder. He takes another bite of toast, moves on... \nSLOW PUSH IN on Paul, watching. He'd like to take his eyes off the screen, but the movie has him in a grip tighter than Brad Dolan's. Elaine is watching him with puzzled concern: \nELAINE Paul? What is it? \nNo response. All he can hear is that music, all he can see are those dancers. The figures on TV are gliding with ghostlike grace in their silvery, phosphor-dot world of long ago... \nPaul abruptly bursts into tears. \nThe room goes quiet, everything comes to a standstill. All eyes turn, some concerned, others merely curious. Paul just sits sobbing into his hands, shoulders heaving. \nELAINE Paul...my God... \nORDERLY (rushing over) What is it? What's wrong? \nPAUL It's okay...I'll be okay... \nAnother orderly appears--Brad Dolan. He puts his hand on Paul's shoulder and leans close, feigning concern. \nBRAD S'matter, Paulie? Why the boo-hoo- hoo? Something nasty happen? \nElaine shoves his hand away, eyes flashing with anger. \nELAINE Mr. Edgecomb will be perfectly fine without your help, thank you. \nBrad back off with a \"hey, suit yourself\" gesture. Elaine helps Paul to his feet and leads him out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUN ROOM - DAY \nPaul is staring out the windows, pensive and drained. It's raining now, pattering the glass and the lawn beyond. Elaine waits across from him, wishing he would speak. Softly: \nPAUL I guess sometimes the past just catches up with you, whether you want it to or not. It's silly. \nELAINE Was it the film? (off his look) It was, wasn't it? \nPAUL I haven't spoken of these things in a long time, Ellie. Over sixty years. \nShe reaches out, gently takes his hand. \nELAINE Paul. I'm your friend. \nPAUL Yes. Yes you are. \nPaul wonders if he's even up to talking about it after all this time...and decides that perhaps he is: \nPAUL I ever tell you I was a prison guard during the depression? \nELAINE You've mentioned it. \nPAUL Did I mention I was in charge of death row? That I supervised all the executions? \nThis does come as a surprise. She shakes her head. \nPAUL They usually call death row the Last Mile, but we called ours the Green Mile, because the floor was the color of faded limes. We had the electric chair then. Old Sparky, we called it. (beat) I've lived a lot of years, Ellie, but 1935 takes the prize. That was the year I had the worst urinary infection of my life. That was also the year of John Coffey, and the two dead girls... \nFADE TO BLACK \nIn blackness, a title card appears: \n\"The Two Dead Girls\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GEORGIA COUNTRYSIDE - DAY (1935) \nHUNDREDS OF PRISONERS work the fields, pickaxes rising and falling in waves, a prison song being sung in cadence with the work. GUARDS patrol on horseback, rifles aimed at the sky. \nA late 20's Ford PRISON TRUCK comes chugging into view along the road, kicking up a long trail of dust in the heat. It seems to be riding unusually low on its rear suspension. \nEXT. COLD MOUNTAIN PENITENTIARY - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nA Depression-era prison in the south. The prison truck sways down the rutted dirt road toward the main gate... \nINT. E BLOCK TOILET - DAY \n...while Paul Edgecomb, early 40's, stands in a cramped toilet in his guard's uniform, trying to piss. His face is pained, his forehead beaded with sweat. \nINT. E BLOCK (THE GREEN MILE) - DAY \nBRUTUS HOWELL(nicknamed \"Brutal\" for his intimidating size, but he's actually rather thoughtful by nature) stands at the entry door of the cellblock, peering out through a viewing slot. He sees the prison truck arrive at the main gate. \nHe turns and nods to fellow guard DEAN STANTON sitting at the duty desk, then cross the Green Mile--a wide corridor of faded green linoleum running some sixty paces top to bottom, with four large cells to a side. \nBrutal steps to the bathroom, listen a moment, knocks softly. \nBRUTAL Paul? Prisoner. \nPAUL (O.S.) Christ. Gimme a minute. \nBrutal waits patiently, a bit embarrassed. He finally hears a THIN TRICKLE, accompanied by a stifled groan of pain. \nBRUTAL You all right in there? \nPAUL (O.S.) For a man pissing razor blades. \nThe door opens, revealing Paul's pale and sweaty face. \nBRUTAL You should'a took the day off, gone to see the doctor. \nPAUL With a new arrival? You know better. Besides, it's not as bad as it was. I think it's clearing up. \nCoffey shakes his head. Harry steps out. \nPAUL My name is Paul Edgecomb. If I'm not here, you can ask for Mr. Terwilliger, Mr. Howell, or Mr. Stanton...those gentlemen there. (beat) This isn't like the rest of the prison. It's a quiet place, we like to keep it that way. \nCoffey considers this carefully, puzzled. \nCOFFEY It weren't me making all the noise, boss. \nPAUL (eyes narrowing) You having a joke on me, John Coffey? \nCOFFEY No, sir. \nPaul sees he isn't joking, continues: \nPAUL Your time here can be easy or hard, depends on you. If you behave, you get to walk in the exercise yard every day. \nWe might even play some music on the radio from time to time. Questions? \nCoffey doesn't miss a beat, as if he's been waiting to ask: \nCOFFEY Do you leave a light on after bedtime? \nPaul blinks. It's the last thing he expected. Coffey smiles uneasily, as if they might think him foolish for asking. \nCOFFEY Because I get a little scared in the dark sometimes. If it's a strange place. \nPaul looks to his men. The guards are trading glances. \nPAUL It's pretty bright in here all night long. We keep half the lights burning in the corridor. \nCOFFEY Cor'der. \nCoffey looks confused. Paul points to the lights lining the ceiling of the Green Mile in wire mesh cages. \nPAUL Right out there. \nCoffey nods, relieved. Then he surprises everybody by offering Paul his hand, as if to show proper manners. Paul hesitates, oddly touched, then surprised his men even more by accepting. Coffey's hand swallows his. Coffey shakes gently, lets go. \nPaul steps from the cell. Brutal slides the door shut, locks it. Coffey stands a moment as if unsure what to do, then sinks onto the cot with his hands clasped between his knees. He looks up at Paul, his voice soft as a whisper: \nCOFFEY Couldn't help it, boss. I tried to take it back, but it was too late. \nPaul turns, leads his men up the Mile... \nPAUL'S INNER OFFICE \n...and they enter a few moments later. Paul is furious, but keeping a lid on his temper: \nPAUL Dean, run Delacroix up to the infirmary and see if his fingers are broken. \nBRUTAL Course they're broken, I heard the damn bones crack. Goddamn Percy. \nHARRY You hear what he was yelling when we brought the big dummy in? \nPAUL How could I miss it, Harry? The whole prison heard. \nThis makes Brutal snort, breaking the tension--the others can't help smiling. \nBRUTAL You'll probably have to answer for sending him off the Mile. He's gonna cause you trouble over this, you mark me. \nPAUL I'll chew that food when I have to. Right now I wanna hear about the new inmate...aside from how big he is, okay? \nBRUTAL (smiles) Monstrous big. Damn. \nPAUL Seems meek enough. Looks like they sent us an imbecile to execute. \nHARRY Imbecile or not, he deserves to fry for what he done. Here... \nHarry tosses a pair of manila envelopes bound with rubber bands on the desk before Paul--Coffey's file. \nHARRY ...make your blood curdle. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. E BLOCK PRISON YARD - DAY \nA small are reserved for inmates of the Mile, fenced-off from the main prison yard. Arlen Bitterbuck walks the perimeter under the watchful eyes of guard BILL DODGE. \nWe find Paul sitting by himself on the bleachers with Coffey's file on his knees, thoughtfully unwrapping his brown- bagged sandwich. PUSH SLOWLY IN as he begins to read... \nEXT. DETTERICK FARM - DAWN (FLASHBACK) \n...and we see Klaus Detterick walk from his house to the barn with a milking pail, a solitary figure against a brightening horizon. He disappears into the barn... \n...and we hold for a long moment, the house silent b.g.,chickens clucking and scratching in the front yard... \n...until a WOMAN'S SCREAM shatters the silence. Klaus reappears, dropping the pail, running toward the house... \nPAUL ON BLEACHERS \n...as Paul turns the page, keeps reading... \nINT. DETTERICK HOUSE - DAWN (FLASHBACK) \n...and Klaus bursts in to find his wife MARJORIE absolutely frantic with terror: \nKLAUS WHAT? GOD SAKES, WHAT? \nMARJORIE THE GIRLS! THE GIRLS ARE GONE! \nShe drags him through the house to a screened-off porch area where their 12 year old son HOWIE is pointing and shouting-- \nHAL Melinda's not so well, Paul. Not so well at all. Got laid up with another headache yesterday. Worst one yet. She's also developed this weakness in her right hand. \nPAUL Doctor still think it's migraines? \nHal gives a slight shake of his head. \nHAL I'll be taking her up to Indianola next day or so for some tests. Had X-rays and the like. She is scared to death. Truth to tell, so am I. \nPAUL If it's something they can see with an X-ray, maybe it's something they can fix. \nHAL Maybe. \nHe pulls a letter, hands it to Paul. \nHAL This just came in. D.O.E. on Bitterbuck. \nPaul glances toward Bitterbuck, scans the letter, nods. \nPAUL You didn't come all the way down here just to hand me a D.O.E. \nHAL No. I had an angry call from the state capital about twenty minutes ago. Is it true you ordered Percy Wetmore off the block. \nPAUL It is. \nHAL I'm sure you had reason, but like it or not, the wife of the governor of this state has only one nephew, and his name happens to be Percy Wetmore. I need to tell you how this lays out? \nPAUL Little Percy called his aunt and squealed like a schoolroom sissy. (Hal nods) He also mention he assaulted a prisoner this morning out of sheer petulance? Broke three fingers on Eduard Delacroix's left hand. \nHAL I didn't hear that part. I'm sure she didn't either. \nPAUL The man is mean, careless, and stupid. Bad combination in a place like this. Sooner or later, he's gonna get somebody hurt. Or worse. \nHAL You and Brutus Howell will make sure that doesn't happen. \nPAUL Easy enough to say. We can't watch him every minute, Hal. \nHAL Stick with it. May not be much longer. I have it on good authority that Percy has an application in at Briar Ridge. \nPAUL The mental hospital? \nHAL (nods) Administration job. Better pay. \nPAUL Then why's he still here? He could get that application pushed through...hell, with his connections, he could have any state job he wants. \nHal has no answer. Paul look off toward Bitterbuck. \nPAUL Tell you what I think. I think he just wants to see one cook up close. \nHal follows Paul's gaze, takes his meaning. \nHAL Well, he'll get his chance then, won't he? Maybe then he'll be satisfied and move on. In the meantime, you'll keep the peace. \nPAUL Of course. \nHAL Thank you, Paul. \nHal rises, slapping yard dust off his trousers. \nPAUL You give Melinda my love, okay? I bet that X-ray turns out to be nothing at all. \nHal walks off looking like he's got the weight of the world on his shoulders. Paul looks at the letter again... \nTIGHT ON LETTER \n...which is head: Date Of Execution.\" \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. PAUL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nPaul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours of the morning, drinking buttermilk and listening to SOFT MUSIC on the radio. JANICE EDGECOMB appears, shuffling sleepily downstairs. \nJAN Paul? \nPAUL Hey, you. Music too loud? \nJAN No. There's just this big empty spot in the bed where my husband usually sleeps. \nPAUL He said to tell you he's having a little trouble with that tonight. \nShe comes into the kitchen, strokes his hair. There's an easy familiarity and a deep love between these two. \nJAN Worried about Melinda and Hal? Is that what's got you up? \nPAUL Yeah, that. Things. \nJAN Things. \nShe sits on his lap and gives him a crooked smile--you're not getting off that easily. \nPAUL Got a new inmate today. Big, simple-minded fella. \nJAN Do I want to hear what he did? \nPAUL No. One sleepless member of this family's enough. (softly) The things that happen in this world. It's a wonder God allows it. \nShe gives him a tiny kiss above his left eyebrow, in that special spot that makes him prickle. \nJAN Why don't you come to bed? I've got something to help you sleep, and you can have all you want. \nPAUL Don't I wish. I've still got something wrong with my waterworks, I don't want to pass it on. \nCUT TO: \nINT. E BLOCK - DAY \nA low, static shot. Green floor stretching before us. Harry and Bill Dodge are at the desk b.g., doing paperwork and filing chores. Percy is idling nearby, whistling softly and combing his hair... \n...and into this quiet shot, deep in foreground, creeps the mouse. He starts walking the Mile as before... \n...right toward Percy. \nCOFFEY \nstares through his bars as the mouse goes by... \nPERCY \nkeeps combing his hair, unaware... \nDEL \nsits quietly picking his nose in his cell. The mouse appears outside the bars, cruising inexorably up the Mile. Del turns slowly, watches the mouse go by... \nPERCY \nstill grooming himself, still unaware... \nTHE MOUSE \nkeeps coming closer. ANGLE UP to Bitterbuck peering through his bars, watching him go by... \nPERCY \nkeeps working that comb--and freezes at the sound of a TINY SQUEAK. His head swivels slowly... \n...and there's the mouse. Staring at him. \nThat moment of eye contact reveals an enmity older than time itself. If mice have a natural enemy, Percy is it. \nPAUL You little son of a bitch. \nHarry and Bill glance up from their work. \nHARRY Well, I'll be damned. There he is, big as Billy-be-frigged. I thought Brutal was pulling my leg. \nBILL That's a goddamn mouse. \nHARRY Yeah. Brute said he was in here last night begging for food, came right up to the desk. \nBILL My ass. Give him some room, Percy, see what he does. \nPercy takes a few careful steps back, eyes never leaving the mouse. (Percy's hand starts easing toward the handle of his baton.) The mouse comes up to the desk as before. \nHARRY Brave little bastard, gotta give him that. \nHarry breaks off a small piece of cracker and drops it. The mouse picks it up, starts to eat. (Percy's hand inches ever closer to his baton). \nBILL Here, lemme try. \nBill drops a piece of cracker. The mouse ignores it completely, keeping its beady little eyes on Harry. (Percy's hand starts easing his baton from its holster.) \nBILL Maybe he's full. \nHARRY (grins) Maybe he knows you're just a floater. Gotta be an E Block regular to feed the E Block mouse, don'cha know... \nHarry drops another piece--and sure enough, the mouse starts to eat. Harry's smile fades. He and Bill trade a look. \nHARRY I was just kidding ab-- \nPercy lets rip a BELLOWING WAR CRY (\"Yaaaahhh!\") and launches his baton like a spear, scaring the crap out of everyone. \nThe mouse ducks (yes, actually ducks) and the baton sail over his head close enough to ruffle its fur, bouncing off the floor. Apparently remembering a pressing engagement elsewhere, the mouse takes off in a flash toward the restraint room. \nPercy roars with frustration and takes off after it, trying to squash it with his heavy work shoes, leaping and stomping with great big galloping strides, missing the mouse by inches... \n...and thus is the Green Mile traversed, with Percy stomping and hollering like a spastic flamenco dancer, the convicts yelling at their bars, the mouse zigging and zagging like Jim Thorpe heading for the endzone... \nThe mouse wins, zipping to safety under the restraint room door. Percy pounds his fist against the door in frustration: \nPERCY FUCK! \nHe fumbles with his keys, unlocks the door, yelling all the while: \nPERCY I'M GONNA RIP YOUR DISEASED HEAD OFF, YOU LITTLE PIECE OF SHIT! \nOUTSIDE E BLOCK \nPaul and Brutal are arriving for work--they pause, hearing PERCY'S YELLS drifting from the windows. The regular CONS in the yard are drifting curiously to the fence, wondering if a riot's brewing. Paul and Brutal take off running-- \nINSIDE E BLOCK \n--and rush in to find: \nHARRY Percy met your mouse. \nHarry points. Percy's down at the far end, rummaging wildly in the restraint room, tossing shit out onto the Mile. \nPERCY It's in here somewhere! I'm gonna squish the little son of a bitch! \nHe starts muscling the filing cabinet out the door, kicking buckets out of his way. Brutal calls out to him: \nBRUTAL Percy, we already tried that-- \nToot springs to his feet and steps from the cell. \nTOOT I'm steppin' forward, I'm steppin' forward, I'm steppin' forward... \nToot turns, shows the top of his head to Dean. \nPAUL Is his head properly shaved? \nDEAN No, it's dandruffy and it smells. \nPAUL I'll take that for a yes. All right, Arlen, let's go. \nToot starts up the corridor, ringed by guards. \nTOOT I'm walkin' the Mile, I'm walkin' the Mile, I'm walkin' the Mile... \nPAUL'S INNER OFFICE \nToot throws himself to his knees as soon as they enter: \nTOOT I'm prayin', I'm prayin', I'm prayin'. The Lord is my shepherd, so on an' so forth... \nPAUL Toot, you have to wait till I tell you to pray. (Toot waits) Okay, pray. \nTOOT Still prayin', still prayin'... \nHARRY Paul, we're not gonna have some Cherokee medicine man in here whoopin' and hollerin' and shaking his dick, are we? \nPAUL Well, actually-- \nTOOT Still prayin', prayin', gettin' right with Jesus... \nHARRY Do it quietly, you old gink! \nHarry slaps Toot upside the head to shut him up. \nPAUL As I was saying, I don't believe they actually shake their dicks, Harry. Be that as it may, Mr. Bitterbuck is a Christian, so we got Reverend Schuster coming in. \nDEAN Oh, he's good. Fast, too. Doesn't get 'em worked up. \nPAUL On your feet, Toot. You've prayed enough for one day. \nTOOT Gettin' to my feet, walkin' again, walkin' on the Green Mile... \nEXECUTION CHAMBER \nThey enter. Brutal is waiting for them, gun drawn. Percy peers out from behind the partition wall from the switch room. \nPERCY What do I do? \nPAUL Watch and learn. \nPaul motions Percy behind the wall. Percy sighs, takes his spot next to Jack Van Hay, peers through the wire mesh as Toot plops into Old Sparky, wriggling his skinny ass to get comfy. \nTOOT Sittin' down, sittin' down, takin' a seat in Old Sparky's lap... \nPaul and Dean kneel to apply the ankle clamps. Brutal steps in from the side, pressing down on the condemned man's left arm to keep him in place until the ankle clamps are secure. Harry moves in from the other side, securing the right arm clamp. \nTOOT Gettin' clamped, gettin' clamped, gettin'--ow, shit, watch the skin! \nPaul signals \"ankles secure.\" Brutal holsters his pistol, applies the final clamp to the left arm. \nBRUTAL Roll on one. \nBEHIND THE PARTITION \nVan Hay mimes turning the generator knob up, whispering: \nVAN HAY \"Roll on one\" means I turn the generator up full. You'll see the lights go brighter in half the prison... \nRESUME MAIN CHAMBER \nas Brutal steps before the \"condemned\" and pronounces: \nBRUTAL Arlen Bitterbuck, you have been condemned to die by a jury of your peers, sentence imposed by a judge in good standing in this state. \nDo you have anything to say before the sentence is carried out? \nTOOT (gleefully) Yeah! I want a fried chicken dinner with gravy on the taters, I want to shit in your hat, and I got to have Mae West sit on my face, because I am one horny motherfucker! \nBrutal tries to hold on, but it's impossible--he cracks up. Everybody falls apart, howling helplessly with laughter. Even Jack Van Hay is guffawing behind his partition. \nOnly Paul is reining it in--he's a little too pissed to go with it. He waits until the laughing fit starts to pass, then: \nPAUL Shut up, Brutal. That goes for everybody. I want quiet in here. (turns) Toot, another remark like that, I'll have Van Hay roll on two for real. \nBRUTAL (beat, gently) It was pretty funny. \nPAUL That's why I don't like it. Tomorrow night we're doing this for real. I don't want somebody remembering a stupid joke like that and getting going again. (off their looks) Ever try not laughing in church once something funny gets stuck in your head. Same goddamn thing. \nBRUTAL Sorry, Paul. You're right. Let's keep going. Harry... \nHarry takes a black mask and snugs it down over Toot's head, leaving only the crown of his head exposed. Brutal takes a large sponge, dips it in a steel bucket, mimes soaking it... \nBEHIND THE PARTITION \nPERCY What's with the sponge? \nVAN HAY You soak it in brine, get it good and wet. Conducts the electricity directly to the brain, fast like a bullet. You don't ever want to throw the switch on a man without that. \nRESUME MAIN CHAMBER \nPAUL (beat) What's with you? Seeing a man die isn't enough? You gotta be close enough to smell his nuts cook? \nPERCY I wanna be out front, is all. Just one time. Then you'll be rid of me. \nPAUL If I say no? \nPERCY I might just stick around for good, make me a career of this. \nPaul just shakes his head in wonder and walks away. \nFADE TO: \nINT. COFFEY'S CELL - DAY \nCoffey's lying on his bunk, weeping quiet tears. He stirs at the sound of GIGGLING. He sits up, peers curiously through the bars. Softly: \nCOFFEY Del? \nAT THE GUARD STATION \nPaul glances up from writing in the daily log. Silence now. He goes back to writing--and the GIGGLING comes again. \nPAUL Delacroix? That you? \nNo answer. Just more giggling. Paul rises, walks down the Mile to Delacroix's cell--and stops, staring in through the bars. \nPAUL'S INNER OFFICE \nBrutal and Dean are having lunch. Paul pokes his head in. \nPAUL You are not gonna believe this. \nRESUME E BLOCK \nThe men follow Paul onto the Mile. By now, Del is CACKLING WILDLY in his cell. Brutal shoots Paul a look--has he gone insane? Paul gestures \"see for yourself.\" \nThey arrive at the bars...and find the mouse sitting on Del's shoulder. Del looks up, giggling like a kid at Christmas. \nDEL Look! I done tame me dat mouse! \nPAUL We see that. \nDEL Watch dis! Watch what he do! \nHe stretches out his left arm. The mouse crawls over the top of his head, scampers along his arm to the wrist, turns around and scampers back. The guards just stand there, staring. \nDEL Ain't he sumpthin now? Ain't Mr. Jingles smart? \nPAUL Mr. Jingles? \nDEL Dat his name. He whisper it in my ear. Cap'n, can I have a box for my mouse so he can sleep in here wi' me? \nPAUL I notice your English gets better when you want something. \nDEL Wanna see what else he can do? Watch, watch, watch... \nHe puts the mouse on the floor, grabs a small wooden spool. The mouse sees it, poises like a man getting ready for a race. \nDEL We play fetch, Mr. Jingles? We play fetch? \nHe tosses the spool across the floor, bounces it against the wall. The mouse goes after it like a dog after a stick--and proceeds to push it back to the bunk, rolling it with its front paws all the way to Delacroix's feet. \nBy now, the guard's jaws are hanging open. Paul's got a funny little chill running up his spine. \nDEL He fetch it ever' time. Smart as hell, ain't he? We do da trick again, watch, watch, watch... \nAgain he throws the spool. Again the mouse goes after it, starts rolling it back. Del howls with laughter, claps his hands like a kid. Brutal murmurs to the others: \nBRUTAL Who's training who here? \nCOFFEY That's some smart mouse, Del. Like he's a circus mouse or something. \nDEL A circus mouse! Dat jus' what he is, too! A circus mouse! I get outta here, he make me rich, see if he don't! \nHe picks up the spool again, makes a drumroll sound, tosses it. The mouse does its thing, rolling the spool back... \n...as Percy enters the scene. Del catches sight of him and scoops up his mouse, drawing fearfully back on his bunk. He tries to hide Mr. Jingles in his hands--but the mouse wriggles from his grasp and scampers up on top of his head, where he regards Percy with mistrustful, beady mouse eyes. \nPERCY Well, well. Looks like you found yourself a new friend, Eddie. \nDel tries to offer some defiance--but all he can manage is: \nDEL Don' hurt him, 'kay? 'kay? \nPercy shrugs as if to say \"no skin off me\", looks to Paul. \nPERCY That the one I chased? \nPAUL (level) Yes, that's the one. Only Del says his name is Mr. Jingles. \nPERCY Is that so? \nPaul trades a look with the others, everybody wondering just what the hell's going through Percy's mind. \nPAUL Del was just asking for a box. He thinks the mouse will sleep in it, I guess. That he might keep it for a pet. What do you think? \nPERCY I think it'll shit up his nose some night and run away, but I guess that's Del's lookout. (beat) We oughtta find a cigar box. Get some cotton batting from he dispensary to line it with. That should do real nice. \nPercy walks away, leaving them dumbstruck. Paul turns to the others. Of all the things they've seen in the last few minutes, Percy being nice is the most amazing of all. \nPAUL Man said get a cigar box. \nPaul comes home from work, still looking numb about the whole thing. He drifts to the kitchen door. Jan's at the counter, slicing vegetables for dinner. She glances at him. \nJAN Hi, honey. How are you feeling? \nPAUL Um...not too bad. \nShe turns back. Paul's eyes drift down to admire her ass. \nJAN What did the doctor say? \nNo response. He's too busy staring. She turns again--he glances hastily up. \nPAUL Oh, you know doctors. Gobble-de- gook mostly. \nShe turns back, keeps working. He crosses the room, eyeing her ass all the way...and surprised her by pressing up against her from behind, running his hands along her hips. \nJAN Paul? What are you doing? \nHe starts laying kisses on the back of her neck, giving her pleasant shivers, murmuring: \nPAUL What's it feel like? \nJAN I know what it feels like...it feels great...but...Paul... \nHe's getting her breathless. She turns into his arms and they get into some passionate kissing. It's not too long before they're frantically peeling each other's clothes off... \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \n...and we find them having a wild tumble in the sheets, both moaning and groaning, sweating and panting. She pushes him flat on the bed, pauses to catch her breath... \nJAN Those must've been some pills. \n...and they keep going, rutting like crazed weasels... \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT \n...as their moans go drifting into the night... \nFADE TO: \nSAME ANGLE AS ABOVE - DAWN \n...and they're still moaning up there as the sun creeps up. \nINT. BEDROOM - MORNING \nJan falls back, exhausted after the latest go-round. She catches her breath, looks over at Paul, and finally: \nJAN Paul? Not that I'm complaining. But we haven't gone four times in one night since we were nineteen. (off his look) You wanna tell me just what the hell's going on? \nPAUL Well...thing is...I never actually got to the doctor yesterday... \nShe gives him a look--oh? \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nPaul is on the phone: \nPAUL Brutal? Listen...I'm thinking of taking the morning off sick. You cover the fort for me? (beat) That's swell. Thanks. Yeah, I'm sure I'll feel better. Okay. \nHe hangs up, turns to Jan. \nJAN You sure you ought to do this? \nPAUL I'm not sure what I'm sure of. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ROAD TO TEFTON - DAY \nPaul's model T comes putt-putting up the road past a sign: \"Trapingus County Welcomes You.\" \nEXT. HOUSE IN TEFTON - BACK PORCH - DAY \nBURT HAMMERSMITH, public defender for Trapingus County, sits with a cold soda and a magazine, watching his TWO CHILDREN playing on a swing at the far end of the backyard. The screen door opens and CYNTHIA HAMMERSMITH ushers Paul out. \nCYNTHIA I offer you a cold drink? \nPAUL Yes, ma'am, a cold drink would be fine. Thank you. \nShe goes back inside. Burt rises. \nPAUL Mr. Hammersmith. Your office said I'd find you at home today. I hope I'm not troubling you. \nBURT That depends, Mr.--? \nPAUL Paul Edgecomb. I'm the E Block superintendant at Cold Mountain. \nBURT The Green Mile. I've heard of it. Lost a few clients your way. \nPAUL That's why I'm here. I'd like to ask you about one of them. \nBurt settles back down, motions \"please sit\". \nBURT Which client? Now you got my curiosity aroused. \nPAUL John Coffey. \nBURT Ah, Coffey. He causing you problems? \nCOFFEY I'm smelling me some cornbread. \nPaul speaks softly so the others can't hear: \nPAUL It's from my missus. She wanted to thank you. \nCoffey nods thoughtfully, absorbing this notion. Then: \nCOFFEY Thank me for what? \nPAUL You know. For helping me. \nCOFFEY Helping you with what? \nPaul motions discreetly to his crotch. \nCOFFEY Ohhh. (beat) Was your missus pleased? \nPAUL Several times. \nPaul hands him the bundle through the bars. Coffey takes it, uncovers the cornbread reverently, gazes back up. \nCOFFEY This all for me? \nPaul nods. Across the way, Del is pressing his face longingly through the bars while Mr. Jingles crawls on his shoulder. \nDEL Oh my. John, I can smell it from here. I surely can. \nCOFFEY (looks to Paul) Can I give some to Del? \nPAUL It's yours, John. You do with it as you please. \nJohn carefully scoops a big chunk of cornbread out with his enormous hand, holds it through the bars to Paul. \nCOFFEY Here's for Del and Mr. Jingles then. \nBILLY Hey! What about me? I'm'a get some too, ain't I \nCoffey looks to Paul--do I have to? \nPAUL It's yours, John. As you please. \nCOFFEY Well. Fine. I think I'll keep the rest, then. \nHe smiles like a big kid, digging in with his fingers. Paul crosses the Mile to Del's cell, hands him his share. \nPAUL Courtesy of the gentleman across the way. \nDEL Oh, John. So very fine of you. So very kind. Mr. Jingles t'ank you. \nCOFFEY (mouth full) ...wel'cm... \nBILLY Hey! What about me? Don't you hold out on me, ya big dummy nigger! \nPaul's temper flares--he steps to Billy's cell. \nPAUL You'll keep a civil tongue on my block. \nBeat. Billy spits in Paul's face and follows it up with a big grin--what are you gonna do about that? Paul is seething as he wipes the spit off, but keeps his temper where it belongs. \nPAUL You get that one for free. But that's the last one. \nPaul walks away. Billy laughs, hollering after him: \nBILLY That's it? Just that little bitty one? Guess I'll have to pay out for the rest, huh? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. E BLOCK - DAY \nHarry is walking the Mile, doing a cell check and jotting on a clipboard. He pauses, making a notation... \n...and a long stream of piss hits his leg. Billy's at his bars, peeing on him. Harry jumps back, stunned. Billy howls with laughter, hosing his aim wildly from side to side. \nBILLY Yeehaaw! Good shot, weren't it? Oh, the look on your face! \nPaul and Brutal come running. Harry's just flabbergasted: \nHARRY You believe this? Son of a bitch pissed on me! \nBILLY Hey, d'jall like that? I'm currently cooking some turds t'go with it! Nice soft ones! I'll have 'em out t'yall tomorrow! \nPaul stays calm, turns to Brutal, nods at the restraint room. \nPAUL We've been looking to clear that room out anyway. \nTIMECUT: \nA STREAM OF GUARDS comes toting the last of the restraint room stuff past Billy's cell while he heckles them from the bars... \nBILLY Hey! Whassit now, movin' day? Y'all wanna come in and dust a little? Y'can shine my knob for me while yer at it! \n...and he pauses as Paul and Brutal step to the bars. Paul has a canvas straitjacket. Brutal pulls his nightstick. \nBILLY You can come in here on your legs, but you'll go out on your backs, Billy the Kid guarantee ya that. (motions to Brutal) C'mon, fuckstick. No sneakin' up on me this time. We'll go man to man, see who's the better fel-- \nBrutal unlocks the cell--and sidesteps, revealing Harry pointing a fire hose. The hose erupts, driving Billy across the cell with bone-jarring force. They batter him half- senseless, then cut the water. Billy collapses in a heap. \nPaul and Brutal drag him semi-conscious from his cell and get the straitjacket on him. He comes around as they draw the straps tight and pull him to his feet. \nPAUL C'mon, Wild Bill. Little walky walky. \nEARL Been sweepin' floors here ten years, never had to wear no damn tie before. \nBILL You're a V.I.P. today, Earl, so just shut up. \nA KNOCK at the door. Everybody takes a seat. Del is ushered in by Brutal. Del faces his audience, puts his hands to his chest in a \"thank you\" gesture worthy of Lillie Langtry before her adoring public, then announces grandly: \nDEL Messieurs et mesdames! Bienvenue au cirque de mousie! \nINT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - DAY \nThe steel cap is lowered over Toot's head, the straps tightened. TILT UP to Percy as: \nPERCY Roll on two. \nBehind his partition, Van Hay mimes flipping the switch. \nVAN HAY That's that. \nA pause. Percy looks anxiously to Paul, who's trading glances with the other guards. Finally: \nPAUL Very good. Very professional. \nPercy smiles. Harry and Dean step up, slapping his back and shaking his hand... \nINT. E BLOCK - DAY \n...and they're still chatting a short time later, waiting for Del's return. Percy actually looks happy for a change, feeling genuinely accepted for the first time... \nBilly is watching from his cell. Just watching. \nThe door opens. Del returns with Mr. Jingles on his shoulder, escorted by Brutal. Brutal is toting the cigar box and spool like a magician's assistant carrying the boss' props. \nPAUL Well? \nDEL They love Mr. Jingles! They laugh and cheer and clap they hands! \nPERCY Well, that's just aces. Pop back in your cell, old-timer. \nThe generosity of Percy's tone catches Del completely off guard. Del gives him a look of almost comical mistrust... \n...and the old Percy comes back. He bares his teeth in a mock snarl and curls his fingers as if to grab Del. It's a joke, but Del doesn't know that--he jerks back in fear and trips over Brutal's big feet. Del goes down hard, hitting the linoleum with the back of his head. Mr. Jingles jumps clear, goes squeaking down the Mile. Del sits up, painfully clutching his head. Brutal helps him up... \nBRUTAL Percy, you shit. \n...and moves him toward his cell. Percy is actually moved to apologize--he starts after them with a half-laugh, drifting much too close to Wild Bill's side of the Mile... \nPERCY Del! Hey, you numb wit, I didn't mean nothin' by it! You all ri-- \n...and Wild Bill's arms thrust out, grabbing Percy and slamming him back against the bars with an arm around his throat. Percy squeals like a pig in a slaughter-chute, thinking he's gonna die. The guards scramble, drawing their clubs--as Billy strokes Percy's hair and whispers in his ear: \nBILLY Ain't you sweet. Soft. Like a girl. I druther fuck your asshole than your sister's pussy, I think. \nBilly kisses Percy's ear--and his hand drops down to squeeze Percy's crotch. Paul pulls his sidearm, taking aim... \nPAUL Wharton! \n...and Billy lets go, stepping back with his hands raised, laughing. Percy darts across the Mile in terror and cringes against the cell opposite, breathing so loud and fast it almost sounds like sobbing. \nBILLY I let 'im go, I'us just playin' and I let 'im go! Never hurt a hair on his purty head! (grins at Percy) Your noodle ain't limp at all, loverboy! I think you sweet on ol' Billy the Kid... (sniffs his fingers) ...oooh, but smell you. \nDown at his cell, Del starts laughing shrilly. Everybody else starts to realize it, including Percy himself...he looks down, sees the huge dark stain spreading at his crotch. \nDEL Lookit, he done piss his pants! Look what the big man done! He bus' other people wid 'is stick, mais oui some mauvais homme, but someone touch him, he make water in his pants jus' like a baby! \nPercy just stares. Brutal shoves Delacroix into his cell. \nBRUTAL Shut up, Del. \nPaul steps to Percy, puts a hand on his shoulder. Percy shakes his hand off, looks around at their faces, whispers: \nPERCY You talk about this to anyone, I'll get you all fired. I swear that to God. \nPAUL What happens on the Mile, stays on the Mile. Always has. \nThe men nod solemnly. Nobody's going to talk about this. Percy looks at Delacroix still snorting in his cell, points at him. \nPERCY You keep laughing, you French- fried faggot. You just keep laughing. \nDel falls silent. Percy turns and storms away as we \nFADE TO BLACK \nIN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS: \n\"The Bad Death of Eduard Delacroix\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. DEL'S CELL - DAY \nPaul is sitting with Delacroix. Brutal is leaning against the bars. Del is throwing the spool. Mr. Jingles is fetching it. \nThe silence is thick. Just the clack-clatter of the spool, and the skitter skitter of tiny mouse paws on concrete. It's getting on Paul's nerves in a big way. Softly: \nPAUL What about Dean? He's got a little boy would love a pet mouse, I bet. \nDel looks horrified at the thought. \nDEL How could a boy be trust wid Mr. Jingles? Maybe forget to feed him. And how he keep up wid his trainin', just a boy, n'est-ce pas? \nDel tosses the spool again--clack-clatter, skitter-skitter. \nPERCY Don't start in on me. It was just a mouse. Never belonged here in the first place. \nPAUL The mouse is fine. Just fine. You're no better at mouse-killing than anything else around here. \nPERCY You expect me to believe that? I heard the goddamn thing crunch. \nPaul steps closer, angry as we've ever seen him: \nPAUL Aren't you glad Mr. Jingles is okay? After all our talks about how we should keep the prisoners calm? Aren't you relieved? \nPERCY What kind of game is this? \nPAUL No game. See for yourself. \nBeat. Percy stalks past them, heads out onto the Mile. Paul and Brutal just wait, saying nothing. Brutal picks up the rag left by Percy, resumes polishing chores on Old Sparky. Paul stretches, cracks his neck. The silence heavy... \n...until Percy reappears. \nPERCY You switched them! You switched them somehow, you bastards! \nBRUTAL I always keep a spare mouse in my wallet for occasions such as this. \nPERCY You're playing with me, the both of you! Just who the hell do you think you are-- \nBrutal grabs him , slams him bodily into the electric chair. Paul bends close, gets right in Percy's face. \nPAUL We're the people you work with, Percy, but not for long. I want your word. \nPERCY My word? \nPAUL I put you out front for Del, you put in your transfer to Briar Ridge the very next day. \nPERCY What if I just call up certain people and tell them you're harassing me? Bullying me? \nPAUL Go ahead. I promise you'll leave your share of blood on the floor. \nPERCY Over a mouse? You think anyone's gonna give two shits? \nPAUL No. But four men will swear you stood by while Wild Bill tried to strangle Dean to death. About that people will care, Percy. Even your uncle the governor will care. \nBRUTAL Thing like that goes in your work record. Work record can follow a man around a long, long time. \nPercy looks from one man to another, knowing he's trapped. \nPAUL I put you out front, you put in your transfer. That's the deal. \nPercy thinks it over, nods. He tries to get up, but Paul keep him pinned...and pointedly offer his hand. \nPAUL You make a promise to a man, you shake his hand. \nPercy hesitates, shakes Paul's hand... \nHIGH WIDE ANGLE OF EXECUTION CHAMBER \n...and Paul pulls him out of the electric chair as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSAME ANGLE AS ABOVE - NEXT NIGHT \nWitnesses are trickling in, filling the seats. A storm is brewing, sending FLASHES OF LIGHTNING across the floors. \nINT. DEL'S CELL - NIGHT \nDel sits with Mr. Jingles in his lap, stroking the mouse between the ears. Paul, Brutal, and Harry appear at the bars. \nDEL Hey, boys. Say hi, Mr. Jingles. \nPAUL Eduard Delacroix, will you step forward? \nDEL Boss Edgecomb? \nPAUL Yes, Del? \nDEL Don' let nothin' happen to Mr. Jingles, okay? \nPaul nods--I promise. Del rises, steps to Paul. \nDEL Here, take him. \nDel lifts his hand. Mr. Jingles steps off onto Paul's shoulder with no hesitation. Gently: \nPAUL Del. I can't have a mouse on my shoulder while...you know. \nCOFFEY I'll take him, boss. Jus' for now. If Del don' mind. \nDEL Yeah, you take 'im, John. Take him til' dis foolishment done--bien! (to Paul and Brutal) After, you take him down to Florida? To dat Mouseville? \nBRUTAL We'll do it together, most likely. Maybe take a little vacation time. \nPaul moves to Coffey's cell. The mouse skitters off Paul's shoulder onto Coffey's hand. \nDEL People pay a dime apiece to see him. Two cents for the kiddies. Ain't dat right, Boss Howell? \nBRUTAL That's right, Del. \nDEL You a good man, Boss Howell. You too, Boss Edgecomb. Wish I could'a met you bot' someplace else. \nDel gives Mr. Jingles one last look, starts to cry. \nDEL Au revoir, mon ami. Je t'aime, mon petit. \nPAUL No water! No water! You crazy? \nHarry backs off with a look of dazed understanding--you don't throw water on a man getting juiced. Right. He drops the bucket, races to get the chemical fire extinguisher instead. \nThe flaming mask peels away, revealing Del's charring face. His eyeballs are misshapen globs of burning white jelly blown out of their sockets. The ATTENDING DOCTOR faints dead away. \nPandemonium now in the room. People shouting and hurrying to exit, chairs falling over, women screaming: \nFAT LADY Stop it, stop it, oh can't you see he's had enough? \nHal grabs Paul by the shoulder, spins him around. \nHAL Why don't you shut it down? \nPAUL He's still alive! You want me to shut down while he's still alive? \nHal is horrified at the thought. Del is jittering and screaming, rocking from side to side, smoke pouring from his nostrils and mouth, his tongue sizzling purple-black. \nThe witnesses are crowding and shoving to get out, but the back door is locked. All they can do is cluster there. \nPaul sees Percy with his head turned away. He grabs him, forces his head around. \nPAUL You watch, you son of a bitch! \nHarry steps up, the extinguisher in his hands. Waiting. Del finally slumps over. He still vibrating, but now it's just the effect of current flowing through his body. \nPAUL Kill it! \nVan Hay kills the current. The HUMMING DIES. Brutal grabs the extinguisher from Harry, shoves it into Percy's hands. \nBRUTAL You do it. You're running the show, ain't you? \nPercy, sick and dazed, aims the extinguisher and hoses the smoking corpse. Hal is near the back, calming the crowd: \nHAL It's all right, folks, it's all under control. Just a power surge from the storm, that's all, nothing to worry about... \nPAUL Dean, get doc's stethoscope. \nDean drops to the doctor's bag, digs through it, hands up the stethoscope. Paul plugs them into his ears. People are moaning and sobbing at the back of the room: \nMAN Oh my God! Is it always like this? Why didn't somebody tell me? I never would have come! \nPaul wipes some foam away from Delacroix's chest, places the stethoscope pad to the raw flesh. He nods to Brutal--it's over. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT \nPaul and the others bring the stretcher down, lay the corpse on the gurney. Percy starts stammering excuses: \nPERCY I didn't know the sponge was supposed to be wet-- \nBrutal hauls off and slugs him. A scuffle ensues as the others grab Brutal and pull him off. \nPAUL Brutal, no! \nBRUTAL What do you mean, no? How can you say no? You saw what he did! \nPAUL Delacroix's dead, nothing can change that, and Percy's not worth it! \nBRUTAL So he just gets away with it? Is that how it works? \nHal comes lunging down the stairs, furious: \nHAL What the fuck was that? Jesus Christ, three witnesses puked all over the floor up there! And the smell! I got Van Hay to open both doors, but that smell won't come out for five damn years, that's what I'm betting! And that asshole Wharton is singing about it! I can hear him! \nPAUL (quietly) Can he carry a tune, Hal? \nThis pulls the plug on the moment--Hal snorts, triggering laughter among the men, a wild release of tension and fear. Everybody starts feeling a bit saner again as it dies down: \nHAL Okay, boys. Okay. Now what the hell happened? \nAll eyes go to Percy. Hal turns, sees Percy's bloody lip. \nHAL Percy? Something to say? \nPERCY I didn't know the sponge was supposed to be wet. \nBeat. A look of utter contempt from Hal. \nHAL How many years you spend pissing on the toilet seat before somebody told you to put it up? \nPAUL Percy fucked up, Hal. Pure and simple. \nHAL Is that your official position? \nPAUL Don't you think it should be? \nHal considers it, nods. \nPAUL He'll be putting in a transfer request to Briar Ridge tomorrow. Moving on to bigger and better things. Isn't that right, Percy? \nPercy nods. Hal steps close, gives him a tight, icy smile. \nHAL You're a little asshole, and I don't like you a bit. (off Percy's look) Have that transfer request on my desk first thing. \nHal heads back up the stairs. Brutal shoves Percy aside and wheels Delacroix's body down the tunnel. \nINT. E BLOCK - NIGHT \nPaul returns to find Wild Bill making up a song in his cell: \nTHE MEN (various, ad-lib) Ma'am, you sure know how to fry up some fine chicken...Brutal, don't hog the taters now...Try that corn yet? It's something special... \nPaul softly interjects: \nPAUL You saw what he did with the mouse. \nThis stops everybody cold. Dean puts his chicken down, wipes his hands. Looks are traded in the silence. \nBRUTAL I could'a gone the rest of the day without you bringing that up. \nDEAN I could'a gone the rest of the year. \nPAUL He did it to me too. He put his hands on me and took my bladder infection away. \nThe men absorb this. Brutal glances to Jan. \nJAN When he came home, he was...all better. \nDEAN You're talking about an authentic healing. A praise-Jesus miracle. \nPAUL I am. \nBRUTAL If you say it, I accept it. But what's it got to do with us? \nJan looks to Paul, realization starting to dawn: \nJAN Melinda? Oh, Paul... \nBRUTAL Melinda? Melinda Moores? \nPaul nods--that's who we're talking about. \nJAN You really think you can help her? \nPAUL It's not a bladder infection, or even a busted-up mouse. But there might be a chance. \nHARRY Hold on now. You're talking about our jobs. Sneak a sick woman onto a cellblock? \nPAUL Hal would never allow that. You know him, he wouldn't believe something unless it fell on him. \nBRUTAL So you're talking about taking John Coffey to her. That's more than just our jobs, Paul. \nDEAN Damn right. That's prison time if we get caught. \nHARRY Let's not discuss this like it's even an option. Brutal, help me out here... \nBrutal lets out a deep breath, considering. He looks to Paul. \nBRUTAL I'm sure she's a fine woman... \nJAN The finest. \nPAUL What's happening to her is an offense, Brutal. To the eyes and the ears and the heart. \nBRUTAL I have no doubt. But we don't know her like you and Jan do...do we? \nPAUL That's why it's a lot to ask. \nHARRY It is. Let's not forget Coffey's a murderer. What if he escapes? I'd hate losing my job or going to prison, but I'd hate having a dead child on my conscience even more. \nPAUL I don't think that'll happen... (beat, softly) ...in fact, I don't think he did it at all. \nThe men are stunned by this. Off their looks: \nPAUL I just can't see God putting a gift like that in the hands of a man who would kill a child. \nDEAN Well, that's a tender notion, but the man's on death row for the crime. Plus, he's huge. If he tried to get away, it'd take a lot of bullets to stop him. \nBRUTAL We'd all have shotguns in addition to sidearms. I'd insist on that. (to Paul) He tried anything, we'd have to take him down. You understand. \nPAUL I understand. \nBRUTAL (beat) So. Tell us what you had in mind. \nFADE TO BLACK \nIN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS: \n\"Night Journey\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. INFIRMARY BUILDING/DISPENSARY - NIGHT \nA FLASHLIGHT BEAM plays across a glass cabinet, scanning the contents. The beam pauses. A hand enters frame, unlocks the cabinet, pulls out a bottle of morphine tablets... \n...and WE ANGLE TO Brutal as he shakes half a dozen pills onto his palm, pockets them, replaces the bottle on the shelf. He turns and slips five bucks to a NIGHTSHIFT ORDERLY. \nBRUTAL I was never here. \nORDERLY Shit, for five bucks, you was never nowhere. \nINT. E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT \nA MORPHINE PILL is being crushed to powder on the stainless steel gurney. TILT UP to Paul crushing the pills. Brutal carefully scrapes the powder onto a small sheet of paper... \nINT. PAUL'S INNER OFFICE - NIGHT \nPercy is parked in Paul's chair with his feet up, reading a book titled: \"CARING FOR MENTAL PATIENTS.\" \nINT. E BLOCK - NIGHT \nPaul and Brutal walk to the front door as the lights inside the house keep clicking on. The last one finally comes on over the stoop, the front door opens a crack...and the twin barrels of a shotgun poke out into the night. \nHAL Who the hell goes there at two- thirty in the goddamn morning? \nPAUL Hal, it's us! It's Paul and Brutal--it's us! \nThe door swings wider, revealing Hal's face gaunt and haggard in the yellow porch light, stunned to see them: \nHAL Paul, what are you doing here at this hour? Jesus, it's not a lockdown, is it? Or a riot? \nPAUL Hal, God's sakes, take your finger off the trigger... \nHal doesn't, aiming past them at the truck in the yard. \nHAL Are you hostages? Who's out there? Who's by that truck? \nCoffey steps into the glare of headlights with Harry tugging on his arm, trying to hold him back. Hal cocks both hammers. \nHAL John Coffey! Halt! Halt right there or I shoot! \nHis aim wavers as a woman's voice comes from upstairs: \nMELINDA (O.S.) Hal? Who are you talking to, you fucking cocksucker? \nA frozen moment. Hal mortified. Paul gives him a look--is that Melinda? \nHal's shotgun shifts back to Coffey--but Paul steps in front of the muzzle. \nPAUL No one's hurt. We're here to help. \nHAL Help what? I don't understand. Is this a prison break? \nPAUL I can't explain what it is. You just have to trust me. \nCoffey comes up the steps, brushes Paul aside, stops before the warden. Hal blinks, his thoughts suddenly fuzzy--it's that benign hypnotic effect Coffey has. \nHAL What do you...want? \nMELINDA Hal! Make them go away! No salesmen in the middle of the night! No Fuller brushes! No French knickers with come in the crotch! Tell them to take a flying fuck in a rolling d...d... \nWe hear the sound of GLASS BREAKING, then she begins to sob. \nCOFFEY (a whisper) Just to help. Just to help, boss, that's all. \nHAL You can't. No one can. \nCoffey pulls the shotgun gently from Hal's grasp, hands it to Paul. Coffey moves past Hal into the house... \nINT. HOUSE - NIGHT \n...and comes up the hallway toward the stairs. \nHAL Don't you go up there! Don't you do it! \nCOFFEY Boss, you just be quiet now and let me be. \nCoffey mounts the stairs with the others at his heels, heading up toward that quavering voice: \nMELINDA (O.S.) Stay out of here! Whoever you are, just stay out! I'm not dressed for visitors, you rat's asshole! \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCoffey enters, trailed by the others. Paul pauses, horrified. \nThe woman propped in bed barely resembles Melinda Moores anymore--she looks made up like a Halloween witch, her livid skin hanging in a loose trail of wrinkles, one corner of her mouth twisted. Yellowish bile stains her chin and the front of her nightgown. Her hair has gone white and straw-like, her eyes glowering at Coffey with lively, irrational interest: \nMELINDA Oh, so big! Pull down your pants! Let's have a look! \nHal groans with despair. Coffey just stands there for a moment, watching her from a distance, then approaches the bed... \nMELINDA Don't come near me, pigfucker. \n...but as he draws closer, a change occurs. Her features soften, her eyes become more sane and aware. \nMELINDA Why do you have so many scars? Who hurt you so badly? \nCOFFEY Don't hardly remember, ma'am. \nCoffey sits on the edge of the bed. The lights seem to flare hotter and brighter. Tears are forming in Melinda's eyes. \nMELINDA What's your name? \nCOFFEY John Coffey, ma'am. Like the drink, only not spelt the same. \nShe lays back, staring at him with shining fascination. The world seems to be slowing down, growing very still indeed... \n...and he starts bending slowly toward her. \nCOFFEY Ma'am? \nMELINDA Yes, John Coffey? \nCOFFEY I see it. I see it. \nHe comes closer...closer still... \nCOFFEY You be still now. You be so quiet and so still. \nHe brushes her forehead with his lips...the gentlest whisper of a kiss...then moves his mouth down to hers. For a moment we can see one of her eyes staring past him, filling with an expression of surprise... \n...and then her face is lost to view as Coffey puts his lips on hers. We hear a soft whistling sound as he begins inhaling the air deeply from her lungs. Something hot and glowing starts passing between them, drawn on his breath... \nIN BLACKNESS, A TITLE CARD APPEARS: \n\"Coffey on the Mile\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. E BLOCK - NIGHT \nDean starts babbling with relief as they return: \nDEAN Am I glad to see you! You were gone so long! Wild Bill's making noises like he's gonna wake up... (notices Coffey) What the hell's wrong with him? \nBRUTAL He's hurting, Dean. Hurting bad. \nDean jumps in, helps them steer Coffey into his cell. \nPAUL John, we're gonna set you on your bunk now. Ready? \nCoffey nods, sits heavily on the bunk. He lowers his head, breath rasping like a rusted hinge. The guards step out. \nDEAN What about Mrs. Moores? Was it like the mouse? Was it a...you know...a miracle? \nPAUL Yes. Yes it was. \nPaul scans their faces. Smiles are traded. An exultant beat. \nHARRY Damn. I think we got away with it. \nBRUTAL We still gotta convince a certain somebody to keep his trap shut. \nPAUL Get his stuff. \nDean hurries off to retrieve Percy's holster and baton. Brutal unlocks the restraint room door, swings it open. Percy is revealed sitting against the wall, glaring, his mouth still taped. Paul crouches down. Brutal joins him. \nPAUL I want to talk, not shout. I take the tape off, you gonna be calm. \nPercy nods. Paul takes hold of the tape, preparing to yank. \nBRUTAL My mother always said if you do it fast, it won't hurt so much. \nPaul rips the tape off. Percy's eyes water with pain. \nBRUTAL I guess she was wrong. \nPERCY Get me out of this nut-coat. \nPAUL In a minute. \nPERCY Now! Now! Right n-- \nPaul slaps him hard, knocks him sideways. Percy looks up, blinking in surprise. Paul grabs him, yanks him back up. \nPAUL You shut up and listen. You deserved to be punished for what you did to Del. You'll accept it like a man, or we'll make you sorry you were ever born. We'll tell people how you sabotaged Del's execution-- \nPERCY Sabotaged! \nPAUL --and how you pissed yourself like a frightened little girl. Yes, we'll talk, that's a given--but, Percy, mind me now...we'll also see you beaten within an inch of your life. \nPercy blinks, unable to grasp that. \nPAUL We know people, too, are you so foolish you don't realize that? People with friends and loved ones doing time in this prison. People who'd be happy to amputate you nose or your penis just so someone they care about could get an extra three hours in the exercise yard every week. (off Percy's look) Let bygones be bygones. Nothing's hurt so far but your pride...and nobody need ever know about that except the people in this room. \nBRUTAL What happens on the Mile, stays on the Mile. Always has. \nA long pause. Softly: \nPERCY May I be let out of this coat now? \nThey pull him to his feet, undo the straps. He shrugs out of the straitjacket and adjusts his clothes, trying to maintain a shred of dignity. \nPERCY My things? \nDean hands them over. Percy smooths his hair and puts his hat on, starts strapping on his holster belt. \nPAUL Think it over, Percy. \nPERCY Oh, I intend to. I intend to think about it very hard. Starting right now. \nPercy exits the restraint room. Brutal whispers to Paul: \nBRUTAL He'll talk. Sooner or later. \nPaul nods with weary resignation--yeah, I know. \nON THE MILE \nPercy pauses near Coffey's cell, careless as always, getting his holster buckled--and a massive black arm grabs him through the bars. His SCREAM brings Paul and the others from the restraint room. \nCoffey's face is pressed so tight between his bars it looks like he's trying to push his head through. He draws his lips back, baring his teeth in an awful sneer... \nPercy whacks him with his baton. Coffey barely seems to feel it. He curls his free hand around the back of Percy's head, pulling him ever closer... \n...and Percy's screams are muffled as their mouths come together. Coffey begins exhaling as if he'd held his breath for hours. Percy jerks like a fish on a hook, but can't get away. The men jump in, try to pry Percy loose, hollering for Coffey to let him go. \nThe black \"insects\" are flowing from Coffey to Percy, swirling into his mouth, up his nose, down his throat. \nSeveral lightbulbs explode in their steel cages up and down the Mile. Percy's baton drops from his nerveless fingers and clatters to the floor, never to be picked up again. \nAnd then Coffey steps back, rubbing his mouth as if he's tasted something bad. The color has returned to his skin. \nPercy, however, is ashen gray. His expression is blank as a sheet of paper, not a trace of awareness in his eyes. \nCUT TO: \nTIGHT ON COFFEY'S FACE \ngazing with wide-eyed, open-mouthed wonder, the light of a motion picture projector flickering on his skin... \nINT  PRISON AUDITORIUM - NIGHT \n...while Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers dance up there on the big screen, images flowing in magical black and silver tone. \nFRED ASTAIRE (singing) Heaven, I'm in heaven...and my heart beats so that I can hardly speak... \nPaul and the men are scattered about in the otherwise empty auditorium, also watching. \nPROJECTION BOOTH \nToot operates the projector, peering through the tiny window into the theater. He yawns, glances at his watch. Late. \nIN THE AUDITORIUM \nFred and Ginger are now in the most passionate and graceful part of the dance. Irving Berlin's music swells. \nCOFFEY \ncan't believe what he's seeing. He's so excited his breath is caught in his throat. Softly: \nCOFFEY Why, they's angels. Angels. Just like up in heaven... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. E BLOCK - NIGHT \nFOUR PAIRS OF FEET come marching up the Green Mile. \nANGLE ON COFFEY \nPaul appears at the bars with Brutal, Harry, and Dean. Nothing is said. Coffey knows why they're here. He rises as Brutal unlocks the cell, slides the door open. Coffey steps out, looks around at their dazed and sad faces. \nCOFFEY I be all right, fellas. This here's the hard part. I be all right in a little while. \nPaul indicates St. Christopher medal around John's neck: \nPAUL John, I should have that just for now. I'll give it back after. \nJohn lets him take the necklace. Paul pockets it. They start to walk the Mile as: \nCOFFEY You know, I fell asleep this afternoon and had me a dream. I dreamed about Del's mouse. \nPAUL Did you, John? \nCOFFEY I dreamed he got down to that place Boss Howell talked about, that Mouseville place. I dreamed there was kids, and how they laughed at his tricks! My! \nHe laughs at the memory of it, then grows more serious: \nCOFFEY I dreamed those two little blonde- headed girls were there. They 'us laughing, too. I put my arms around 'em and sat 'em on my knees, and there 'us no blood comin' outta their hair and they 'us fine. We all watch Mr. Jingles roll that spool, and how we did laugh. Fit to bus', we was. \nBehind them, Dean stifles a sob. \nPAUL'S INNER OFFICE \nCoffey kneels. Paul joins him, self-conscious and uncertain. \nPAUL What should we pray for, John? \nCOFFEY Strength? \nPaul nods--strength it is. Dean surprises Brutal and Harry by also kneeling. Brutal and Harry hesitate...then join them. \nPAUL God, please help us finish what we've started, and please welcome this man, John Coffey--like the drink, but not spelled the same-- into heaven and give him peace. Please help us to see him off the best we can and let nothing go wrong. Amen. \nPaul starts to rise, but Coffey takes his hand. \nCOFFEY I know a prayer I once heard. Can I say it? \nPAUL You go right ahead, John. Take all the time you need. \nCoffey closes his eyes, frowning in deep concentration. \nCOFFEY Baby Jesus, meek and mild, pray for me... \nAnd Paul sees: \nKathe and Cora Detterick kneeling together in the enclosed porch that night, just before their bedtime: \nKATHE AND CORA ...and every child. Be my strength, be my friend... \nAnd then the vision is gone as: \nCOFFEY ...be with me until the end. Amen. \nCoffey rises, offers Paul his hand, helps him up. \nEXECUTION CHAMBER \nFull house tonight. Bill Dodge is waiting at Old Sparky. \nSilence as Coffey is led in, all eyes on him. Klaus and Marjorie Detterick are in the front row. She mutters: \nMARJORIE Die slow, you bastard. \nCOFFEY \nIt's late in the day as: \nPAUL That was the last execution I ever took part in. Just couldn't do it anymore after that. Brutal either. We both transferred out, took jobs with Boys' Correctional. (beat, nods) That was all right. Catch 'em young, that became my motto. Might even have done some good. \nANGLE SHIFTS TO Elaine listening. Uncertain. \nPAUL You don't believe me. \nELAINE I don't imagine you would lie to me, Paul. It's just that... \nPAUL ...It's quite a story. \nELAINE Yes. Quite a story. (pause) One thing I don't understand. You said you and Jan had a grownup son in 1935. Is that right? (Paul nods) But if that's true... \nPAUL The math doesn't work, does it? \nShe shakes her head. Paul thinks for a moment, comes to a decision. \nPAUL You feel up to a walk? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GEORGIA PINES - DAY \nThe rain has mostly stopped. Brad Dolan, back in street clothes, gets in his pickup truck and drives away... \nINT. NURSING HOME - DAY \n...while Paul and Elaine watch from a window. \nEXT. GEORGIA PINES - DAY \nThis time, we see two red specks trudging slowly up the ridge toward the treeline. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nPaul brings Elaine along the wooded path into view of the storage shacks. They're both wearing ponchos. \nPAUL There. It's in there. \nELAINE Paul? This thing you want to show me. Is it scary? \nPAUL Scary? No. Not really. \nHe gives her a smile, offers his hand. She takes it. \nINT. SHACK - DAY \nWe see Paul approach through the grimy window as before, this time bringing Elaine. ANGLE SHIFTS to the door as they arrive, creaking open on rusty hinges to reveal them. \nThey enter. Elaine looks around at the musty nooks and crannies, wondering what they're doing here. Paul touchers arm, directs her attention: \nPAUL There. \nElaine moves closer, sees it on the dusty floorboards: \nAn old cigar box. \nFor a moment, she doesn't know what to make of it. \nPAUL Hey. Wake up, old boy. Wake up. \nElaine's breath catches in her throat... \n...as a pair of bright oilspot eyes peer over the edge of the cigar box. It's a mouse. His fur, once brown, is now all gray. \nELAINE Paul? It isn't...it can't be... \nPaul gets down on the floor, holds out his hand. \nPAUL Come over here, boy. Come on over her and see this lady. \nThe mouse tries several times to get over the side of the cigar box before he finally makes it. He comes to them, hobbling and crippled with arthritis. Paul pulls a slice of toast from his pocket, breaks off a small piece for the mouse. \nELAINE That can't be Mr. Jingles. \nPaul says nothing, just pulls a spool from his pocket. Mr. Jingles might be old, but he's as obsessed as ever. He gets ready to fetch, eyes riveted to the spool. Softly: \nPAUL Messieurs et mesdames. Beinvenue au cirque du mousie. \nPaul tosses the spool. The mouse limps painfully after it. He reaches it, goes around...and has to lay down to catch his breath. Elaine starts forward, but Paul holds her back. \nAfter a moment, Mr. Jingles finds his feet again. He rises and starts nosing the spool back to Paul. \nELAINE Oh, Paul. Don't make him do it again. I can't bear to watch. \nPAUL (softly) But he loves it so much. \nHe glances around at the shack with a sad smile. \nPAUL This isn't exactly the Mouseville we had in mind...but we make do, don't we, old fella? \nBRAD (O.S.) As I live and breathe! \nThey gasp and spin. Brad Dolan stands in the doorway. \nBRAD Fooled you, didn't I Got yourself a little love nest here, I see... \nHe pauses, seeing Mr. Jingles. \n", "test1_input": "Percy does a quick impression of a man jittering and jerking in the electric chair. \nPERCY Bzzzzzzzzt-zap! Just like that! How's it feel to know you're gonna die with your knees bent? \nDEAN C'mon, Percy, give us a hand. \nLaughing, Percy picks up the pants. They proceed to help Billy into them one leg at a time... \nCUT TO: \nINT. E BLOCK TOILET - DAY \nPaul is trying to piss. Except for a few drops hitting the bowl, excruciating pain seems to be the only result. He gives up, grabs a towel, wipes the sweat from his feverish face... \nINT. E BLOCK - DAY \n...and steps gingerly from the toilet. Del's watching. \nDEL Don' look so good, boss. Look like you runnin' you a fever. \nPaul shoots him a baleful look--no kidding. Another voice calls softly from further down the Mile: \nCOFFEY (O.S.) Boss Edgecomb? Needs ta see you down here, boss. \nPAUL Got things to tend to just now, John Coffey. You be still in your cell now, y'hear? \nCoffey falls silent. Paul goes to the entrance door and peers through the viewing slot, anxious to have this over with... \nEXT. COLD MOUNTAIN PENITENTIARY - DAY \nThe prison truck appears, swaying along the rutted road... \nIN THE TRUCK \n...while Billy Wharton stares at nothing, drool dripping from his slack mouth in long strings. \nINT. E BLOCK - DAY \nPaul watches the truck pull in. He draws away from the slot, proceeds toward the empty cell which used to be Bitterbuck's... \nANGLE ON TRUCK \nThe rear doors are swung open. Harry emerges. Dean and Percy are guiding Billy by the arm, helping him down... \nINSIDE E BLOCK \nPaul waits at the empty cell. ANGLE PANS TIGHT to Coffey at his bars, eyes widening in a blossoming of some nameless fear or dread. Something bad's coming. A whisper: \nCOFFEY Careful. \nOUTSIDE E BLOCK \nBilly is brought to the door. Dean pulls his keys, starts to unlock it. We PUSH IN on Billy's face, where the tiniest trace of a smile is starting to grow... \nINSIDE E BLOCK \n...and Coffey's unease grows with it. he presses his face to the bars, his whispering becoming more urgent: \nCOFFEY Careful. Careful. \nPaul hears him, glances back with a puzzled look. Coffey's gaze is directed at the door, which is being unlocked... \nTHE DOOR \n...and opened. In that moment, the slack look on Billy's face gives way to a wild grin. A CRAZED SCREECH leaps from his throat, a cross between a rebel yell and a dog being tortured, freezing everybody's blood in their veins-- \nBILLY Yeeeeeeehaaaawwwwwwrooooo! \n--and he drops his wrist-chain down over Dean's head, jerks it tight, begins to strangle him. Dean lurches forward, Billy riding/propelling him through the door onto the Mile. \nPercy stands frozen in the doorway, stunned. Harry shoves him aside and jumps on Billy from behind, trying to get him off Dean. Dean is choking, turning purple. \nPaul rushes from the cell to join the fray. Billy whirls, delivering a stunning kick to Paul's groin. Paul's bladder pain goes nuclear--he falls back in agony, clutching himself and sucking air through his teeth, unable even to scream. \nBilly rams an elbow into Harry's face, knocks him sprawling on the desk, screaming and laughing and howling all the while: \nBILLY WHOOOEE, BOYS! AIN'T THIS A PARTY, NOW? IS IT, OR WHAT? \nPaul forces himself to his feet, pulls his revolver, draws down on Billy... \nPAUL LET HIM GO! \n...but Billy jerks Dean around, using him as a shield... \nBILLY G'WAN, SHOOT! SEE WHO YA HIT! \nDean is choking, dying. Paul is shifting his aim, trying for a clear shot, not getting one. Percy's still just inside the doorway, pressed against the wall with fear... \nPAUL HIT HIM, PERCY! GODDAMN IT, HIT HIM! \nBILLY C'MON, PERCY, HIT ME! HIT ME, YOU LIMP NOODLE, HIT ME! YEEHAWWW! \n...and suddenly a hand comes in, grabs the hickory stick out of Percy's grasp, raises it high-- \n--it's Brutal coming through the door. He swings the baton and lands an awesome blow to Billy's head--THUMP! The force of it spins Billy off his feet and slams him flat on his back. \nDean crawls away, gulping ragged breaths of air. Amazingly, Billy's still conscious--he looks up at Brutal and laughs: \nBILLY Big fucker. Snuck up on me. No fair. \nStill laughing, he makes another grab at Dean. Brutal whacks him again, turning his lights out for good. Brutal drops to Dean's side, helping him hack air back into his lungs: \n", "test1_true": "Everybody's reining in their adrenaline. Paul glares at Harry. \nHARRY We thought he was doped. (to Percy) Didn't we? Didn't we all of us think he was doped? \nPercy nods, still numb. Paul is furious: \nPAUL You didn't ask? I guess that's not a mistake you'll be need to make again anytime soon, is it? \nHarry shakes his head miserably. Paul grabs Billy by the feet. \nPAUL Grab his arms! You too, Percy! (off Percy's hesitation) Percy, goddamn it, get your feet out of cement and help us out here! \nPercy finally unfreezes. The three of them hoist Billy up in a dead-lift, get him in his cell, toss him on the cot. They step out, slam the door, lock it. Paul looks to Harry and Brutal. \nPAUL Get Dean looked at right away, make sure he's all right. \nPercy, you go make a report to the warden for me. Start off by saying the situation is under control-- it's not a story, he won't appreciate you drawing out the suspense. \nBRUTAL What about you? You look about ready to collapse. \nPAUL I've got the Mile till you all get back. Go on now. \nThey all exit. As soon as he's alone, Paul gives in to the pain, holding his crotch and sinking to his knees with a moan. It's so bad he actually lays down on the Mile, face pressed against the cool linoleum, wishing he were dead. A stretch of silence...and then: \nCOFFEY (O.S.) Boss? Needs ta see ya down here. \nPAUL This is not a good time, John Coffey. Not a good time at all. \nCOFFEY (O.S.) But I needs ta see ya, boss. I needs ta talk t'ya. \nPaul sighs. Things couldn't get much worse than this. He rises with a supreme effort, walks painfully down the Mile... \nCOFFEY'S CELL \n...and finds Coffey waiting at his bars. \nCOFFEY Closer. \nPAUL I'm alone here right now, John. Figure this is close enough. \nCOFFEY Boss, please. I got to whisper in your ear. \nPaul blinks. Maybe it's the fever clouding his brain, or maybe...hell, is this what being hypnotized is like? He tries to shake the sensation off, comes a little closer. \nDEL Boss? You know you not s'pose to do dat. \nPAUL Mind your business, Del. What do you want, John Coffey? \nCOFFEY Just to help. \nHis hand shoots out, grabs Paul by the collar, jerks him close. Paul makes a panic-grab for his revolver... \n...but Coffey lays his free hand atop Paul's, eases his grip from the gun--no need for that. Coffey's hand then drifts slowly down, easing to Paul's crotch... \nPAUL (stunned, frozen) What are you...doing? \n...and something goes WHUMP through Paul's body. He arches back with his mouth agape and arms outstretched as a rush of energy seems to pass from Paul through Coffey's hand... \n...and then it's over. Paul comes back to the real world, weak against the bars, realizes Del is hollering in his cell: \nDEL HELP! JOHN COFFEY'S KILLING BOSS EDGECOMB! HELP! \nPAUL Del, Chrissake, settle down, I'm fine... \nIt dawns on him that he really is fine. Fever's gone. So is the pain in his groin. John Coffey, though, seems to be having trouble. He sits down on his bunk, bends forward, gagging like a man with a chicken bone caught in his throat. \nPAUL John? John, what's wrong? \nPaul fumbles his keys to the lock, unsure if he should open the door, watching the big man's contortions grow stronger like a cat trying to cough up a hairball... \n...and then comes an unpleasant, gagging/retching sound as Coffey's lips draw back from his teeth in a kind of godawful sneer...and he exhales a cloud of what look like tiny black insects. They swirl furiously in front of his face, turn white...and disappear. Paul just stares, stunned. Softly: \nPAUL What did you do, big boy? What did you do to me? \nCOFFEY I helped it. Didn't I help it? \nPAUL Yes, but...how? \nCoffey shrugs--it's something that just is. \nCOFFEY Just took it back, is all. Awful tired now, boss. Dog tired. \nHe rolls onto his bunk, faces the wall. Paul just stares at him, stunned. He turns and walks up the Mile, his stiffness and pain now gone. Del watches him go by, also stunned: \nDEL What dat man do to you? He throw some gris-gris on you? (off Paul's look) You look diff'int! Even walk diff'int. Like y'all better! \nPAUL You're imagining thing. Lie down, Del. Get you some rest. \nPaul continues up the Mile... \nE BLOCK TOILET \n...and steps back into the toilet. Not trusting this situation for even a moment, Paul opens his fly, takes a deep breath to prepare himself for the pain, starts to pee... \n...and we hear a healthy stream of water hitting the bowl. The look on Paul's face says it all--blessed relief. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DUSK \n", "test1_id": 2373, "test2_input": "PERCY Please, Paul. Don't put me in with Wild Bill. Please. \nPAUL You would think that. \nPaul gives him a hard, angry shove... \nINT. E BLOCK - NIGHT \n...and they bring him down the Mile to the restraint room door. Brutal takes Percy's holster and baton. \nBRUTAL You'll get 'em back, don't worry. \nPERCY That's more than I can say about your jobs. All your jobs! You can't do this to me! You can't! \nPaul steps forward with a roll of strapping tape. \nPAUL Let you in on a little secret. We can and we are. \nHe slaps the tape over Percy's mouth and shoves him back into the restraint room. Percy stands breathing heavily through his nose, making muffled mmmmph-mmmph! sounds under the tape. \nPAUL You're going to have a few hours of quiet time now, so you can reflect on what you did to Del. \nBRUTAL (grins) If you get lonely, think about Olive Oyl... (thrusting his hips) ...uk-uk-uk-uk! \nAnd they slam the door, shutting Percy into darkness. \nA WALL-MOUNTED GUN SAFE \nis unlocked, shotguns pulled out. The men load up, heading down the Mile as: \nPAUL One more time--what do you say if somebody comes by? \nDEAN Coffey got upset, so we put him in the restraint room. They hear any noise, they'll think it's him. \nThey come to Coffey's cell. \nCOFFEY We goan for the ride now? \nPAUL That's right. \nThe cell is unlocked. Coffey emerges. Paul motions them along, still grilling Dean: \nPAUL What about us? \nDEAN You're over in Admin, going over Del's file. Brutal and Harry are in the laundry doing their wash-- \nA skinny white arm suddenly shoots out from Wild Bill's cell and grabs Coffey by the wrist. The men gasp, shocked to see Billy on his feet, grinning and weaving like a punch-drunk. \nCoffey's reaction is beyond simple surprise; he's actually trembling at Billy's touch as if some electrical circuit were engaged. His eyes are wide and horrified, as if he'd just put his hand in a basket full of snakes. He tries to pull away, but Billy has him tight, that mysterious circuit blazing. \nBILLY (slurring wildly) Where you fink you're goin'? \nCoffey responds softly, with utmost horror: \nCOFFEY You're a bad man. \nBILLY S'right, nigger. Bad as you'd want. \nPaul plucks Billy's hand off Coffey's arm--and Coffey flinches back as the circuit is broken. \nBILLY Whooeee. Whole room's spinning. Like I'm shit-ass drunk. I have me some shine or what? \nHe turns and staggers back to his bunk, muttering all the way: \nBILLY Niggers oughtta have they own 'lectric chair. White man oughtn't havta sit in no nigger 'lectric chair, nossir... \nHe goes face-first onto his bunk. Coffey is still staring. \nCOFFEY He's a bad man. \nINT. EXECUTION CHAMBER - NIGHT \nCoffey is brought in...and freezes in horror at the sight of Old Sparky. A whisper: \nCOFFEY They're still in there. Pieces of them, still in there. I hear them screaming. \nAll eyes go to the electric chair. It sits shrouded in shadow like an ominous throne. Never before has this place felt so haunted to the men. It makes the hairs on the neck stand up. \nPAUL John, come along! Right now, y'hear? C'mon! Toward that door! \nCoffey finally responds, pulling away... \nINT. E BLOCK ACCESS TUNNEL - NIGHT \n...and they come down the steps. They realize Coffey will have to stoop all the way down the tunnel. Paul pats the gurney. \nPAUL Lie down on this. (off Coffey's look) It'll be easier for you and no harder for us. \nCoffey eases carefully onto the gurney, lying on his back. His knees hang over the edge and his toes touch the ground, but it works. They push him along, traversing the pools of light. \nCoffey actually starts to smile. He reaches out his arms, fingertips touching the tunnel walls as they go by. \nCOFFEY Say. This is fun. \nEXT. PRISON WALL - NIGHT \nA massive iron door SQUEALS open onto a little-used fenced enclosure. Paul and the others bring Coffey up from the tunnel below, emerging into the night. Coffey's breath catches as he gazes wondrously up at the stars, pointing: \nCOFFEY Look, boss! It's Cassie, the lady in the rocking chair! \nPAUL Shhh. John, you have to be quiet now. \n", "test2_true": "BRUTAL We see her, John. \nHarry goes first, hugging the shadows as he pulls his keys to unlock the gate... \nWIDE SHOT OF PRISON \n...while TOWER GUARDS huddle in their enclosure atop the walls. An occasional SPOTLIGHT cuts the darkness. FIREFLIES dance in the fields and trees as far as the eye can see. \nFour dark figures detach from the shadows, hurrying across the lonely country road into the fields on the far side... \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nCoffey's hand scoops up some fallen leaves. TILT UP to his face as he crunches them under his nose, inhaling their smell. \nHe see the guards throwing him anxious looks. He misreads this, holds out his hand so they can smell too. They do it, just to make him happy. \nPAUL C'mon, big boy, keep moving. \nA FEW FIREFLIES come winking through frame as the group presses on... \nANOTHER AREA/WOODS \nThe trees are growing sparser, opening onto fields. MORE FIREFLIES are flitting into view, trailing in their wake... \nBRUTAL How far is it? \nHARRY Just up ahead... \nHarry brings them to a thicket of trees. They start removing branches and boughs, uncovering a battered old FARMALL TRUCK hidden in the brush. \nThe men pause. Even more fireflies are swirling around them, growing in number. It's getting downright weird. \nCoffey laughs softly, drawing their attention. A childlike smile has utterly transformed his face. He raises his hand, letting a firefly weave playfully in and out of his fingers. \nCOFFEY Hey there, little firefly. Where's Mrs. Firefly this evening? \nAnother firefly joins the first, both now dancing and blinking around his fingers. Coffey laughs again. \nCOFFEY Oh, there you is. You come out to play too? \nThe men stand gaping. The fireflies are flitting to Coffey as if to a beacon. He waves his hands slowly, fireflies blinking and trailing from his fingertips like magic dust. \nThey begin orbiting his shiny bald head like tiny glowing planet orbiting a sun, their light kicking a mellow sheen off his ebony skin. Coffey's eyes meet Paul's. \nPAUL They seem...drawn to you. \nCOFFEY I love 'em, is why. They don't think no hurtful thoughts. They's just happy to be. Happy little lightning bugs... \nThe men don't know whether to be enchanted or terrified. Harry gives Paul a look--can we go? Please? \nPAUL C'mon, big boy. Upsy-daisy. \nCoffey clambers up on the stakebed. Paul and Brutal join him. Harry gets in behind the wheel, jabs the starter button... \nON THE STAKEBED \n...while Coffey sits with his back to the cab. \nPAUL John? Do you know where we're taking you? \nCOFFEY Help a lady? \nPAUL That's right. Help a lady. But how did you know? \nCOFFEY Dunno. Tell the truth, boss, I don't know much'a anything. Never have. \nThe truck pulls out. Coffey waves as the fireflies get left behind, dwindling away like stars. \nCOFFEY Bye, fireflies. Bye. \nWIDE ANGLE OF COUNTRYSIDE \nThe truck rumbles from the fields onto a dirt road, countless fireflies swirling in its wake... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MOORES HOUSE - NIGHT \nHeadlights come over the rise. The truck appears, rumbling down toward the house. The world is isolated and still. \nIN THE TRUCK CAB \nHarry stops and cuts the engine, leaving the headlights on. Silence now, save for the trilling of crickets. \nIN THE STAKEBED \nPaul and Brutal both look terrified now that they're actually here. An urgent whisper: \nBRUTAL We can still turn back. \nPaul hesitates, wanting to do just that, but: \nCOFFEY Boss, look. Someone's up. \nLights are coming on inside the house. Coffey rises and steps down from the truck, pulling Paul along. Brutal follows them. \nBRUTAL This is a mistake. Christ, Paul, what were we thinking? \nPAUL Too late now. Harry, keep John here until we call you. \n", "test2_id": 2374, "test3_input": "DEAN ...well, I dunno, he just snapped, I guess... \nHARRY ...s'right, one minute he's fine, the next--blammo... \nBRUTAL ...bastard grabbed him through the bars a few days back, scared the boy so bad he wet himself... \nHal turns, sees: \nPERCY \nsits handcuffed on the floor of the Mile, eyes glassier than Wild Bill's. TWO COPS are trying to snap him out of it: \nCOP #1 Son! Son! Can you hear me? \nCOP #2 Speak up if you can hear us! We gotta ask you some questions! \nA MEDIC is raising Percy's eyelid with his thumb, shining a penlight, getting no reaction. \nMEDIC I think this boy's cheese slid off his cracker. \nHAL \nsees Paul, motions him aside to talk privately: \nHAL I'll cover you as much as I can, even if it mean my job, but I have to know. Does this have anything to do with what happened at my house? Does it, Paul? \nPaul looks Hal in the eye. As with Bitterbuck, the lie comes easy: \nPAUL No. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nTRACKING A PAIR OF FEET shuffling into the room in hospital slippers, escorted by TWO ORDERLIES. The patient is brought to a window. The orderlies turn to leave... \n...and we BOOM UP to reveal Percy, catatonic, staring out the same window where we met Wild Bill... \nEXT. HOSPITAL - DAY \n...and we WIDEN SLOWLY from Percy at the window to reveal his last stop in life. It's emblazoned on the gate: BRIAR RIDGE MENTAL HOSPITAL. He finally got that transfer. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - DUSK \nTIGHT ON PAUL as softly: \nPAUL It makes sense. I read the file. Hal even said it himself. Wharton rambled all over the state last few years, causing trouble. Hell, longer than that. Been at it since he was ten. Vandalism. Petty theft. Setting fires. \nANGLE SHIFTS to include Jan, Brutal, Harry and Dean. They're in the brambly patch that borders the woods behind the house. The sun is setting, turning the horizon fiery. \nJAN You saw him. You actually saw this Wild Bill person take those girls. \nPAUL Their father hired him on for a few days last spring, help repair the barn. Cheap labor, just another drifter... \nBRUTAL Only not. \nPAUL Sick bastard came back a month later, just before dawn. Took the girls...did what he did. Coffey found them afterwards and tried to help. It was too late. \nJAN (absorbs this) Then you can stop it. The execution, I mean. Get Coffey a new trial. \nPAUL Based on what, honey? Some kind of magical vision I had? \nJAN Show this farmer--what's his name, Detterick?--show him a picture of Wild Bill. (off their looks) Why not? If Wharton was there...if the farmer can identify his picture and they know he was there... \nBRUTAL Him being there in May doesn't mean he came back and killed those girls in June. Even if he was committing other crimes. \nPAUL They got their killer as far as they're concerned. \nHell, Coffey's own lawyer would come throw the switch if we let him. \nJAN Then lie. \nPAUL Lie? About what? \nJAN Tell them Wharton confessed to the crime. Brutus, you can back him up, say you heard it too. You can say that's what set Percy off. He shot Wharton because he couldn't stand thinking of what happened to those two little girls, it snapped his mind... (seeing their looks) ...what? What now? \nDEAN We never reported anything like that. We would've, too, everybody knows it. It's part of our job. \nBRUTAL Besides, confessing don't make it so. Slugs like Wild Bill lie about everything. Crimes they committed, women they had, even the weather. \nJAN But he was there! He painted their barn! He ate dinner with them! \nPAUL All the more reason he might take credit for the crime. He's gonna fry anyway, so why not boast? \nJan stands thinking for a moment, then: \nJAN All right. Then you've got to get John Coffey out on your own. \nHARRY Ma'am? \nJAN You did it once, didn't you? Only this time, don't bring him back. \nDean blinks, stunned by this notion. Gently: \nDEAN Ma'am, your son's grown up and moved away. My kids are just starting kindergarten. Will you be the one to explain to them why their daddy's in prison? \nJAN Work out a plan. Make it look like a real escape. \nHARRY Better be a plan an imbecile could dream up. Nobody'd believe it otherwise. \n", "test3_true": "JAN Why not? Just why the hell not? \nPAUL Because he's a six-foot-eight-inch baldheaded black man with barely enough brains to feed himself. How long you think it'd be before he was recaptured? Two hours? Six? \nJan swipes a tear away with the heel of her hand. Softly: \nJAN Do you mean to kill him, you cowards? Do you? \nPaul tries to take her hand. She wrenches away, furious. \nJAN Don't touch me! Next week this time you'll be a murderer, no better than that man Wharton, so don't touch me! \nShe runs off toward the house, starting to sob as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT  PAUL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nPaul is at the kitchen table in the wee hours, at his regular place, sipping his beer. Irving Berlin's \"Remember\" PLAYS SOFTLY on the radio. Jan comes down, looking miserable and exhausted. \nJAN I'm so sorry I called you a coward. I feel worse about that than anything I've ever said to you in our whole marriage. \nPAUL Even that time we went camping and you called me Old Stinky Sam? \nShe can't help smiling at that. He returns the smile, offers her a sip of beer. She takes it, sits. \nJAN Does Hal know? That Coffey's innocent, I mean? (Paul shakes his head) Can he help? Does he have the influence to do something about this? \nPAUL No. \nJAN Then don't tell him. If he can't help, don't tell him. Ever. \nPAUL I won't. \nJAN (beat) There's no way out of this for you, is there? \nPAUL No. I've been thinking about it, too, believe me. (beat) Tell you the truth, honey. I've done some things in my life I'm not proud of, but this is the first time I've ever felt in real danger of hell. \nJAN Hell? Oh Paul... (touches his face) Talk to him. Talk to John. Find out what he wants. \nCUT TO: \nINT. E BLOCK - NIGHT \nCoffey sits quietly in his cell, a solitary firefly flitting in circles around his finger. Paul and the men appear. The firefly flits away, vanishing through Coffey's tiny window. \nCOFFEY Hello, boss. \nPAUL Hello, John. \nBrutal unlocks his cell. Paul enters. \nPAUL I guess you know we're coming down to it now. Another couple of days. (beat) Is there anything special you'd like for dinner that night? We can rustle you up most anything. \nCoffey gives it some careful thought. \nCOFFEY Meatloaf be nice. Mashed taters with gravy. Okra, maybe. I's not picky. \nPAUL What about a preacher? Someone you could say a little prayer with? \nCOFFEY Don't want no preacher. You can say a prayer, if you want. I could get kneebound with you, I guess. \nPAUL Me? \nCoffey gives him a look--please. \nPAUL S'pose I could, if it came to that. \nPaul sits, working himself up to it: \nPAUL John, I have to ask you something very important right now. \nCOFFEY I know what you gonna say. You don' have to say it. \nPAUL I do. I do have to. (beat) John, tell me what you want me to do. You want me to take you out of here? Just let you run away? See how far you can get? \nCOFFEY Why would you do such a foolish thing? \nPaul hesitates, emotions swirling, trying to find the right words. \nPAUL On the day of my judgement, when I stand before God, and He asks me why did I kill one of his true miracles, what am I gonna say? That is was my job? My job? \nCOFFEY You tell God the Father it was a kindness you done. (takes his hand) I know you hurtin' and worryin', I can feel it on you, but you oughtta quit on it now. Because I want it over and done. I do. \nCoffey hesitates--now he's the one trying to find the right words, trying to make Paul understand: \nCOFFEY I'm tired, boss. Tired of bein' on the road, lonely as a sparrow in the rain. Tired of not ever having me a buddy to be with, or tell me where we's coming from or going to, or why. Mostly I'm tired of people being ugly to each other. \nI'm tired of all the pain I feel and hear in the world ever' day. There's too much of it. It's like pieces of glass in my head all the time. Can you understand? \nBy now, Paul is blinking back tears. Softly: \nPAUL Yes, John. I think I can. \nBRUTAL There must be something we can do for you, John. There must be something you want. \nCoffey thinks about this long and hard, finally looks up. \nCOFFEY I ain't never seen me a flicker show. \n", "test3_id": 2375}

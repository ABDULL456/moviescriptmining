MITCH Yeah, it could be my Raging Bull. Plus I'd get to kill a lot of women, which is cool. (offering him a joint) Hotbox? 
DAVE No, man, I got a big day tomorrow, I can't get wasted tonight. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
TWO SHOT GLASSES SLAMMING DOWN Mitch and Dave, shit-faced, shake off their shots, B-R-R-R. 
INT. BIG WANGS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT 
The guys sit in this crowded sports bar, watching the Dodgers game on a huge TV. When CLAYTON KERSHAW strikes out FRED LEWIS to win the game, the guys drunkenly slap five: 
DAVE 
MITCH 
DAVE 
MITCH Change-up -- fuck he's good! 
DAVE He's no Fernando. 
MITCH Of course not. Fernando is like The Highlander. There can be only one. 
DAVE (toasting his beer) 
TO FERNANDO! 
MITCH 
FER--FUCKING--NANDO! They sloppily drink -- when Dave suddenly remembers: 
DAVE OH! So finish your story! The girl calls you up...? 
MITCH Right! So she calls me up, it's like 3 in the morning-- 
DAVE What's her name? 
MITCH Tatiana. 
DAVE Incredible. What's her last name? Mitch just looks at him. 
MITCH Tatiana Calls-Me-At-3-In-The- Morning-And-Wants-To-Fuck-stein, what the fuck, who cares? 
DAVE Is she hot? She is, right? Oh my God I already have a boner! 
MITCH 
(DISTURBED) Maybe we should do this later... 
DAVE NO! Keep going! I need these stories, man! They're all I have. Mitch registers the desperation in his married friend's eyes. 
MITCH Okay, well, you're in luck, because Tatiana is stupid fucking hot. Beautiful face, legs a mile long, perfect ass, blonde hair, and huuuge boobs. 
DAVE Oh my God how big? 
MITCH Double E. 
DAVE Oh my God she sounds like Sabrina. 
MITCH Who's Sabrina? 
DAVE This hot paralegal in my office. 
MITCH Is she on your Cancer List? 
DAVE What's a Cancer List? 
MITCH Don't all married dudes have a Cancer List? No? Like the first three chicks you would bang if your wife suddenly died of cancer? 
DAVE That's sick, man. Jamie is the mother of my children... 
(DISGUSTED) But yes, if I had a Cancer List, Sabrina would be the first on it.

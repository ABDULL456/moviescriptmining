Thank you. 
Meanwhile the next message comes on.  It is a girl from Ed's class. 
SADIE 
(on machine) 
Hello, Mr Saxon? This is Sadie, from your creative writing class. Anyway, you didn't show up today and I just wanted to see if you were OK and, you know, if there was any reading or anything you wanted us to do. My number is 323-4854. I hope you're alright. Bye. 
DERM 
A student? 
ED 
Yes. 
DERM 
Do they call you often? 
ED 
No, but they all have my number. 
The next message is from Susie. 
SUSIE 
(on machine) 
He, Ed. I just wanted to find out what happened last night. If Eve ever showed up, or what happened. Call me at work, 
ED 
I thought she might have gone over there last night.  Excuse me, I better call the University. 
The next message is Detective Derm again and it plays behind Ed's conversation. 
ED 
Hi, Mrs Mastrioni? 
MRS MASTRIONI 
(over phone) 
Yes. 
ED 
This is Ed Saxon. 
MRS MASTRIONI 
Oh, yes.  Didn't make it in today, huh? 
ED 
I guess not. 
MRS MASTRIONI 
There were students waiting for you. 
ED 
Yes, I know.  It's a personal matter. 
MRS MASTRIONI 
A personal matter, huh? 
ED 
That's right. 
MRS MASTRIONI 
So you'll be in tomorrow. 
ED 
Yes, tomorrow. 
MRS MASTRIONI 
Or you'll call. 
ED 
Or I'll call, yes.  Hello?  Hello? 
Ed hangs up, having been hung up on.  He turns around to see Derm standing right by, listening to his call. 
The next message is from George Simian, a man who works with Eve. His cautious voice makes it known that it is weird that he is calling. Ed pays special attention to this call. 
GEORGE 
Hi, Eve. This is George, from school. You didn't come into work today and I just wanted to make sure everything was OK. I guess I'll see you tomorrow. 
DERM 
Who's that? 
ED 
Some guy she worked with.  P.E. teacher, I think. 
DERM 
I see.  Mr Saxon, does your wife have an address book? 
ED 
Yes. 
DERM 
Could I see it, please?  And a picture, if you have one.

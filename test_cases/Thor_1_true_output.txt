THOR What's wrong? 
JANE SHIELD, whatever they are. They're never going to let this research see the light of day. 
THOR You must do this. You must finish what you've started. 
JANE Why? 
THOR Because you're right. It's taken so many generations for your people to get to this point. You're nearly there. You just need someone to show you how close you really are. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 83. Thor moves beside her, opens her notebook, turns to the page which bears a sketch of the Bifrost. He takes the pen from the notebook, begins to add to the sketch, leading from one point to another in space. 
THOR (CONT'D) Look -- your ancestors called it magic. You call it science. I come from a place where they're one and the same thing. We recognize that Thor is drawing the branches of Yggdrasil as she looks on, amazed and intrigued. 
JANE What is it? 
THOR This is how my father explained it to me... 
(THEN) Your world is one of the Nine Realms of the Cosmos, linked to each other by the branches of Yggdrasil, the Worlds Tree. Now, you see it every day, without realizing. Images glimpsed through -- what did you call it?... (checks her notebook) ...this Hubble Telescope. So, Nine Realms... They look at each other. She nods. They smile. This is going to be a long night. 
101 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - LATER 101 
Jane sleeps beside Thor on the blankets on the rooftop. He stares up at the night sky. She rolls close to him, nuzzles against him in her sleep. He looks down at her, beautiful in the moonlight, looks out at the town beyond her. 
102 INT. HEALING ROOM - DAY 102 
Volstagg eats ravenously from a PLATTER OF FOOD. Sif stands nearby, ill at ease. Fandral watches Volstagg incredulously as the large warrior stuffs himself. Finally Fandral can stand it no more. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 84. 
FANDRAL Our dearest friend banished, Loki on the throne, Asgard on the brink of war, yet you manage to consume four wild boar, six pheasant, a side of beef, and two casks of ale. Shame on you! Don't you care?! Fandral moves to throw the platter in the fire, but Volstagg pulls his weapon, stopping him. 
VOLSTAGG Do not mistake my appetite for apathy. 
SIF Stop it, both of you! We all know what we have to do, we're just too damned afraid to do it! 
HOGUN 
(DECIDES) We must go. We must find Thor. Hogun starts to pull the delicate HEALING STONES from the fire, carefully putting them into a POUCH at his side. 
FANDRAL It's treason, Hogun. 
VOLSTAGG To hell with treason, it's suicide. 
(SUDDENLY NERVOUS) Now, shh! Heimdall may be watching! It's said he can hear-- 
FANDRAL Yes, yes, we know! 
SIF Thor would do the same for us. An EINHERJAR GUARD enters. They tense. 
EINHERJAR GUARD Heimdall demands your presence. Volstagg quickly drains his flagon of ale. 
VOLSTAGG We're doomed.

4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 85. He stands, offers his hand, helps her to her feet. 
105 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB 105 
Thor helps Jane down off a ladder. A groggy, hungover Selvig emerges from Jane's trailer. He sees Thor with Jane. Selvig eyes the two of them together, then: 
SELVIG I need some coffee. The three head inside Smith Motors. 
FROM THE LIBRARY ROOFTOP ACROSS THE STREET SHIELD Agents Garrett and Cale watch the scene, pointing a small audio surveillance device towards the lab. 
105A INT. SMITH MOTORS - LAB - DAY 105A 
Darcy and Selvig sit at a card table, drinking coffee. Thor holds a couple plates as Jane makes eggs on a hotplate. She scoops them out onto the plates. Thor takes them over to the table, sets them down before Selvig and Darcy. 
DARCY Thanks. 
THOR You're very welcome. Jane joins them at the card table with a couple more plates. She and Thor sit with the others and start to eat their breakfast, looking like a little family.

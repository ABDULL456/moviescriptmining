DISSOLVE TO HER HANDS wrapping bare lamp wire around two thumbtacks stuck into the insides of the pinchers of a common wooden clothespin.  The wire goes OFF SCREEN. 
ANOTHER ANGLE as she inserts a Lifesaver between the two prongs. One end of the fishline is tied to the lifesaver.  The whole now is stretched taut about three inches off the living room carpet. 
ON NANCY carefully filing a hole in a LIGHTBULB. 
OH HER pouring powder and shot from shotgun shells into the opening in the bulb until it's full, then sealing it with tape. 
DISSOLVE TO HER screwing the bulb back into the floor lamp, and placing the thing near the foot of the stairs.

175.  INT.  NANCY'S UPSTAIRS HALLWAY.  NIGHT.                            175. 
-- NANCY completes installing a sturdy sliding bolt to the outside of her own bedroom door. 
-- NANCY screws a hinge into the wall directly above her door. Attached to the hinge is the shank of something -- some kind of tool.  We can't see what it is because CAMERA never quite frames the whole thing. 
-- NANCY tiptoes to her mother's door and peeks in. 
176.  INT.  MARGE'S BEDROOM.  NIGHT.                                     176. 
MARGE lies propped in her bed looking back at NANCY.  Her drunkeness has been altered by the SIRENS and BABBLE outside into a sort of comatose clarity. 
MARGE Guess I should'n'a done it. 
NANCY Just sleep now, Mom. 
MARGE Just wanted to protect you, Nan.  Just wanted to protect you... 
MARGE slides over on her side.  NANCY smooths her hair, covers her as she would a child, then exits the room.

178.  INT.  NANCY'S ROOM.  NIGHT.                                        178. 
The girl enters, turns out her bedside light, slips out of her dress and puts on her nightgown.  Then she kneels by her bed. 
NANCY (quietly) Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the Lord my soul to keep. If I should die before I wake, I pray the Lord my soul to take. 
She gets into bed and pulls the blankets to her chin. 
CLOSE ON NANCY's face.  She stares straight up at the ceiling for a long moment, then closes her eyes.

179.  INT.  GLEN'S LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT.                                  179. 
LT THOMPSON trudges down the stais and confronts GLEN'S FATHER. 
LT THOMPSON I know it's hard to think at a time like this, Walter, but can you think of anyone who could've done such a thing? 
The father stares away, his voice low and dull. 
MR LANTZ He done it. 
THOMPSON looks at the man, baffled. 
LT THOMPSON Who?  Who did that? 
MR LANTZ Krueger. 
LT THOMPSON Krueger? 
The father gives him the strangest look. 
MR LANTZ Had to've done it.  No one else was in there. 
LT THOMPSON How you know that? 
MR LANTZ Cause I thought Glen was gonna sneak out to see your lunatic daughter, that's why. So I locked him in his room! (getting control) Sorry.  Anyways, the door was still locked when we heard the screams. 
He blinks. 
MR LANTZ (CONTD) Maybe god's punishing us all... 
LT THOMPSON (much lower and hard) Keep your head -- this is a fucking flesh and blood killer we're talking about. 
MR LANTZ Like Rod Lane?

{"train": "DOG DAY AFTERNOON \n\"DOG DAY AFTERNOON\" \nby \nFrank Pierson \nFinal Draft \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ELECTRIC SIGN \nIt FILLS THE SCREEN (designed to exactly FILL THE FRAME size of whatever ratio we're shooting in).  It says: \nThis message will be a little cryptic to the movie audience on an essentially BLACK SCREEN.  HOLD for a beat, then it changes: the lights flash this sign, which should explain it to everyone: \nAnd a slow distant ROLL OF THUNDER in the far distance; now the SOUND of media begin to come up loud, under: \nEXT. FLATBUSH AVENUE - DAY \nLONG SHOT down the Avenue, 400 mm lens, heat waves shimmering, thousands of old people, and people with children in strollers moving restlessly about in the heat on those endless miles of benches. \nThe SHOT is ON SCREEN only for a beat or two, then gone... \nSOUND TRACK COMES FROM A THOUSAND TRANSISTOR RADIOS, TV SETS, AUTO RADIOS, BLENDED IN THE OPEN AIR... \nRADIO ANNOUNCER 1 (V.O.) ...the situation continued tense in the Middle East today, as... \nEXT. SHEA STADIUM (TV CLIP) - DAY \nAn unnamed player swings and hits a high pop up... \nANNOUNCER 2 (V.O.) ...hits a high inside pitch foul into the upper stands... \nANGLE ON CROWD \nas the ball comes down they scramble and fight for it... \nA touch of viciousness... \nANNOUNCER 3 (V.O.) ...B-52's meanwhile, unleashed the heaviest bombing of the war... \nEXT. MOVIE HOUSE TO MACDONALD'S - DAY \nWe are SEEING HEIDI, though we don't know it yet - she's just another pretty 175-pound Italian girl with two kids, KIMMY, JIMMY, about four and five years old.  Right now she is a lump of browning flesh, shining with oil among rows of similar ladies (mostly thinner, but all with a certain unhealthy softness about them) laid out in rows and groups across the sand.  SHOOT LOW AND LONG, so heat shimmers rise, as though the heat were baking the oil out of this mob, visible suntan oil pollution...  Heidi's transistor blasts ROCK MUSIC into the air. \nLYRICS (OVER) (Roberta Flack) REVEREND LEE, SHE SAID, LORD KNOWS I LOVE YOU, REVEREND LEE - DO IT TO ME (etc., etc.) \nANNOUNCER 3 (V.O.) ...the American High Command announced the famed 25th Cavalry Division would be coming home!  The 25th Cavalry, long since afoot, hardened in battle in the jungles of World War II... \nFAR DISTANT THUNDER ROLLS... \nINT/EXT. SONNY'S CAR - STREET - DAY \nIt is parked in a drab Brooklyn street.  Beside the car stands SAL, medium height, also good-looking in an intense boyish way.  His eyes dart about suspiciously, the ever-watchful Sal. \nThere is a watchful reserve in Sal that contrasts to Sonny's outgoing bounciness: first impression is Sonny is all bark; Sal is the bite.  Sal is dressed in impressive blue suit style, he looks like a kid trying to impress the Godfather. He even wears a hat.  Now, matching Sal's preparations inside the car, he checks his tie's alignment, shoots his cuffs and is ready... \nMeanwhile, on their car radio: \nELTON JOHN (Amoreena) AND SHE DREAMS OF CRYSTAL STREAMS OF DAYS GONE BY WHEN WE COULD LEAN LAUGHING FIT TO BURST UPON EACH OTHER... \nANOTHER ANGLE BY CAR \nAs he turns, from the back of the car, JACKIE appears with a huge florist box, tied with ribbon.  Jackie is an eighteen year old with bad complexion and in contrast to Sonny and Sal is dressed in teenage sloppiness.  Adidas, T-shirt, bowling jacket, jeans.  He is uncertain: waits for directions from Sonny.  Sonny takes the florist box from him. \nWe see a water truck drive down the street, followed by Sonny's car, which drives up near bank.  It stops, Jackie gets out, crosses to bank window, peers through, then \nANGLE INSIDE CAR \nreturns to car.  Leans in, has fake conversation with Sonny. \nThey are waiting.  Sonny checks his watch, turns to Sal in back seat: \nSONNY 30 seconds, Sal... \nThey wait.  At appropriate moment, Sal exits car, walks toward bank.  Slowly Sonny gets out. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nA slightly seedy little branch bank, old yellow brick, blond varnished wood, a rubber plant, an American flag.  Through the windows we SEE HOWARD, the aged black bank guard, in uniform, taking down the American flag from outside.  Past him comes Sal carrying an attache case.  He passes Howard coming toward us through the door into the bank.  As he passes CAMERA: \nINSERT: BANK CLOCK \nas it CLICKS from 2:57 to 2:58 PM. \nMOVING SHOT WITH SAL \nas he moves toward the left-hand deposit-slips desks. \nseeing that the bank is closed, locked in, with no customers, crosses toward the front teller's cage area, carrying the florist box.  As he reaches the other side, he rips open the box and takes the rifle out and aims it level onto SYLVIA BALL, the teller, who automatically takes the \"closed\" sign and holds it in front of her face as though to protect herself from the rifle. \nSYLVIA (holding sign in front of her face) Sorry, this window is shut... \nTWO SHOT - MULVANEY AND SAL \nas Mulvaney stands and yells to Sylvia... \nANGLE ON BACK OF BANK, REST ROOM AREA \nas MARGARET, an accountant, comes out of the ladies' room, starts to cross downstage toward her desk, sees what is happening, and momentarily freezes in her tracks. \nSONNY \nThe cues have got all fucked up, but he's so programmed and ready, he can't adjust, so the speech he had ready comes out now: \nSONNY Okay, this is a stickup!  Nobody move!  This is a fucking stickup! Just freeze now, goddammit!  Get away from your desk... get in the center - get in the center! \nSylvia and Edna start to move toward the rear of the bank, toward Margaret's desk. \nMULVANEY \naghast at his own outspokenness... Sal holding the gun levelled on him. \nMULVANEY Okay, okay... we know it's a stickup! \nSONNY (to Jackie, re: Howard) If he moves - blow his guts out... Cover him! \nTWO SHOT - SONNY & JACKIE \nJackie, staring at the real guns, turns to Sonny... \nJACKIE I'm sorry, Sonny... I can't make it... \nJackie starts to move toward the front door. \nSONNY Hey, for christ's sake... now... fuckin' asshole... (turns to Sal) He can't make it. \nSAL Fuck him - let him out! \nSonny yells out at frozen Howard. \nSONNY Hey... let him out! \nMULVANEY (yells) Do what the gentleman says, Howard. \nSonny sees that Howard is useless, so he runs to Howard, grabbing the keys from him and pulls Howard along with him to the front door.  Jackie unlocks the door, and Jackie, with a last apologetic glance, gives his gun to Sonny and vanishes into the sweltering afternoon.  Sonny then frisks Howard and has a sudden afterthought as he locks the door again.  He quickly unlocks it and shouts out at Jackie. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nSONNY Hey, don't take the car! \nJACKIE (on sidewalk) Well, how'll I get home? \nSONNY Take the subway.  We need the car. (as Jackie starts to walk away) Hey, gimme the keys - the keys! \nJackie stops, fumbles for keys, crosses back to Sonny with them. \nJACKIE (points to fig. desk) Sonny, there's somebody under that desk over there... I'm sorry... \nSONNY It's okay... it's okay... \nSonny turns into the bank once more, as Jackie walks off toward the subway, pointing inside at a desk near the window as he does, to point something out to Sonny. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nSonny, re-entering the bank, speaks to Howard. \nSONNY Lock it. \nSonny now crosses to desk that Jackie indicated, as everyone watches him, as though it's all in the game. \nSONNY (taps loudly on top of desk) Hey... get outta there!  Nobody's gonna hurt you. \nJENNY, a young, frightened girl, peeks out from under the desk, obviously afraid to reveal herself. \nSonny starts to move toward the front of the bank.  Sal turns so he can cover everyone.  Sonny turns to order Howard. \nSONNY Pull the drapes. \nHoward doesn't move. \nSONNY Pulla drapes! \nHoward belatedly leaps to work, pulling drapes that screen off the interior from outside.  The door has no drapes or blinds and thus when the drapes are closed there is a corridor of space across the street we will always be able to see. And from which people outside will always be able to see in. As Howard finishes the task, he then walks back to the huddled group on the rear. \nSONNY \non his way to the back of the bank, is digging into his jacket pocket; he swings around as he passes the camera that is bolted to a wall bracket covering the tellers' area.  He whips out a spray can and gives the lens a shot of red paint. There are three cameras in all, each of which he sprays. \nSONNY (grinning) No replay, folks... no alarms... \nSONNY (to Miriam) Okay... open this. \nMiriam crosses to gate, presses the necessary button and the gate opens from them.  Sonny watches this carefully, noting where the buzzer button is.  He crosses in front of the drawer at the first cage.  He tries to open the drawer. \nIt's obviously locked. \nSONNY Okay, who's the head teller here? \nSYLVIA I am. \nSONNY Open this up! \nSylvia comes forward and unlocks the first drawer, and begins to remove the cash, but Sonny grabs her hands...  alarmed... \nSONNY Don't take it all out! \nHe grabs a piece of paper or cardboard... \nCLOSE SHOT - SONNY'S HANDS AND CASH IN DRAWER \nHe takes all the singles but one out of the singles slot in the drawer, leaving the bottom single in place.  It is held there by a metal clip.  He carefully slips the paper under the clip and then removes the single. \nIt is clear this is an automatic alarm - meanwhile... \nSONNY Boy, I can't trust a one of you... I worked in a bank, I know the alarms, so don't try to fool around with me! \nBACK TO SHOT OF SONNY AND SYLVIA AND MIRIAM \nas they move to 2nd cash drawer at 2nd teller's cage.  Sylvia unlocks the drawer and starts to reach in for the cash, but Sonny pushes his hand into the drawer instead.  He begins to stuff the money into the bag.  Some fives, packaged with rubber bands, in the drawer, he holds up so Sal and all can see them... He laughs! \nSONNY Decoy money, right, it's marked! Shit! \nHe throws it into the air so the bills flutter all around him, gaily... In the background, Mulvaney, having finished with the phone conversation, is moving to the rear with the rest of the girls.  Sonny now moves to the 3rd cage's cash drawer... Mulvaney ends phone conversation and Sal moves him over to group at vault. \nSONNY (mimicking Sylvia) 'This window is shut...' \nAgain, the same procedure begins.  Sylvia unlocks the cash drawer and Sonny starts to scoop it out and put it into the opened plastic bag that Miriam holds. \nSAL Cheer up, you'll be the veteran of a robbery, the bank sends you a dozen red roses, you know that? \nAt this point, THE PHONE BEGINS TO RING AGAIN (#2) \nSONNY (yelling to Sal) Sal, let him answer the goddamn phones, they're driving me crazy! Look at this chicken shit! \nAgain, Mulvaney starts to cross back to his desk, again followed by Sal.  Sonny yells out to Mulvaney as he crosses to answer the phone. \nSONNY Hey, you, manager... Don't get any ideas, fucker... See that man there? I bark and he bites! \nMULVANEY Believe me, I'm on your side. \nSONNY My side, shit! \nThey move to Drawer #4. \nSYLVIA Listen, we got young girls here... you could watch your language. \nSONNY I speak what I feel. \nMULVANEY ON THE PHONE \nMULVANEY Hello... I'm sorry I can't talk to you right now... I suggest you call during banking hours tomorrow.  What is your name? \nBACK ON SONNY, SYLVIA AND MIRIAM \nSONNY Gimme the traveler's checks and the register. \nThey cross toward the last drawer area (#5).  Miriam is still crying silently.  Sonny holds out the plastic bag for the checks for her.  She drops it. \nSONNY Please... quit that.  It's not necessary. \nWith everything in the bag, Sonny now takes the register and starts to move the two girls toward the rear near the vault. \nMULVANEY Can you hurry it up? \nBACK TO SONNY \nas he moves toward the rear (Sylvia and Miriam now re-joining other women), to get a wastebasket.  Accomplishing this, he starts to burn the pages of the register, tearing out pages as he does so.  It's smokey as hell, but not burning well. He drops it, smoking, into the wastebasket. \nSONNY (to Howard) Hey, you!  Give me the keys... We're gettin' outta here. \nHOWARD (gasping for breath) Huh? \nMULVANEY Howard? \nHOWARD Huh? \nON HOWARD The old man is panicked, great patches of sweat spreading around his armpits. He breathes in asthmatic gasps; now he flinches at his name, as though he's been hit. \nMULVANEY (stands, receiver still to ear, then covering it with his hand) Howard, give him the keys... \nSONNY Gimme the keys to get outta here! \nwho starts to move toward the front door, looking over at Sonny trying to put out the fire. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS MULVANEY TO THE FRONT DOOR; Sonny moves with him, covering him all the time. \nANGLE ON FRONT DOOR \nas Sonny stands behind closed venetian blinds to listen to the conversation and to cover Mulvaney. \nSONNY The gun's right on your back... \nMULVANEY Give me the keys... \nSonny hands him the keys. \nVERY CLOSE SHOT - SAL \nHe raises the gun and sights it now, and in this moment, we should sense a kind of luxurious relaxation into anticipation on Sal's part.  He is smiling a little, and for the first time, looks happy, and that's what makes him seem dangerous. He's looking forward to an excuse to kill.  It's here now: survival.  There is something almost sexual about the way he settles his body down behind the weapon, getting ready for the squeeze on the trigger, the report, the violent shove of recoil against his muscles and sinews. \nIn the background, we see Sylvia bringing Howard a cup of water. \nANGLE ON DOOR \nemphasizing the small of Mulvaney's back.  The man is somebody he knows from across the street.  He looks worried and mystified... \nMULVANEY (unlocking door) What is it, Sam? \nSAM Everything's all right?  You okay? \nMULVANEY Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket. \nSilence.  Sam stares around... thinking. \nSAM You all right? \nMULVANEY Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all. \nSAM Yeah.  Well, you're okay? \nMULVANEY Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out. \nSAM Okay. \nHe's not satisfied, but he can't see anything and he can't think of anything more to say, so... \nMULVANEY Thanks again, Sam. \nSAM I'm glad it's okay. \nMULVANEY It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.] \nMulvaney locks the door and walks inside the bank, giving the keys back to Sonny. \nMULVANEY For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got. \nSONNY You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split. Otherwise, you go with us. \nMulvaney and Sonny starts to walk back toward Sal.  As they do, the PHONE BEGINS TO RING AGAIN (#3). \nSONNY (to Mulvaney) Answer it. \nMulvaney shrugs helplessly.  Picks up the phone, standing at desk opposite his. \nON SAL \nSAL He's gone? \nSONNY Yeah - it's all right... let's go. \nMULVANEY ON PHONE \nMULVANEY Hello, Mulvaney here... \nTWO SHOT - SONNY & SAL \nSONNY Sal, get 'em in the vault. \nSAL Where's the money? \nSONNY Get 'em in the vault! \nAs Sal starts to herd them into the vault (Sylvia helping Howard, still with the cup of water), Mulvaney is still on the phone.  Sonny moves down to get the money bag atop the teller's cages and we hear Mulvaney on phone. \nMULVANEY (tired) What property is that, Mrs. Anterio? The Third Avenue property - you already got a second mortgage on. We discussed it before... \nANGLE AT VAULT \nThe girls are afraid; Miriam unlocks the gate as Sonny uses Mulvaney's keys to the matching lock. \nJENNY (from inside vault area) You won't close the vault?  How can we breathe? \nSONNY No, that's okay... just close the gate... \nSONNY ...Just give me time to think... \nPHONE STARTS TO RING (#5). \nMULVANEY We're all in the barrel together... \nPhone continues to ring.  Sonny finally grabs it (desk opposite Mulvaney). \nSONNY (into phone) All right, bastards!  You keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time.  You got that? \nA startled apologetic man's voice speaks: Now ANOTHER PHONE BEGINS TO RING (#6). \nMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) I just called to ask Jenny what time she's gonna get off. \nSONNY Who's this? \nMAN (V.O.) It's her husband. \nSonny abruptly holds the phone out from his body at arm's length, disgusted. \nSONNY Is there a Jenny here? \nNobody moves.  They all stare at him.  Finally he singles her out. \nSONNY It's your husband. \nJenny starts to move toward Sonny. \nJENNY What do I say? \nSONNY Tell him the truth!  Tell him whatever you tell him! \nOTHER PHONE CONTINUES TO RING (#6). \nAs he puts down the phone for her to pick up, Sonny reaches for the other phone that is RINGING. \nSONNY What a fuckin' comedy! (into phone) WNEW plays all the hits. \nMORETTI (V.O.) Listen, first off, is anybody hurt in there? \nSONNY ...But you keep away from the bank or we start throwing bodies out the front door one at a time... You got it?  Okay? \nHe hangs up the phone.  Sal looks at him. \nSAL You mean that? \nSONNY What? \nSAL ...The bodies out the door. \nSONNY I want him to think that. \nSAL But do you mean it? \nAt this moment, Jenny, phone in hand, is turned to him, respectfully like a child in an authoritarian household, addressing her father: \nJENNY He wants to know what time you think you'll be through. \nON SONNY \nstares at her.  For the first time, he realizes how frightened she is, how serious, grotesque, and funny it all is.  He takes the time to be tender with her, as though she were a not-too-bright child in the presence of a tragedy she'll never understand. \nSONNY Tell him I don't know. \nNow Sonny turns to speak to Mulvaney. \nSONNY Where's the back door? \nMULVANEY It's locked on the inside. (beat) It's through that passageway and to the right. \nSonny disappears toward the back door.  Jenny continues her phone conversation. \nMAN (V.O.) Jenny? \nJENNY He says he doesn't know.  Why don't you cook whatever's there? \nMAN (V.O.) It looks like a whole roast. \nJENNY Honey, send out for Kentucky fried chicken.  The baby, just open a bottle of prunes, and one of the beef.  The bottles are in the fridge. \nMULVANEY (to Jenny) Hurry up! \nMAN (V.O.) I know how to fix the bottle.  They got guns? \nJENNY (with the baby on her mind) What guns? \nMAN (V.O.) The robbers in the bank.  They got guns? \nJENNY Yeah.  A lot of guns. \nMAN (V.O.) Well, stay away from them.  Don't get close. \nThey are now unified.  Sonny whispers something to Sal. \nSONNY To show that we're negotiating. \nSAL All right... send them the guard. \nSONNY All right... let's go. \nSylvia takes Howard by the arms and starts to lead him toward the front door.  Sal watches as they move toward front door. \nSAL Cover her, Sonny. \nSonny moves with them toward the front door, his gun aimed at them during the walk. \nFinally they arrive, and Howard moves toward the door by himself.  But the door is obviously locked. \nSYLVIA He needs the keys. \nSonny gives her the keys. \nSAL (from the rear) Only one, Sonny. \nSonny covers Sylvia as she moves to unlock the front door for Howard. \nSYLVIA Go along, Howard. \nANGLE OUTSIDE DOOR \nAs Howard is pushed out the door by Sylvia, a cop from a nearby car rushes up to him and shoves him to a curbside car where he bends Howard over the car, putting his hands behind him for handcuffs and starts to frisk him. \nHOWARD'S POV - QUICK CUTS \nAbout 100 weapons ranging from machine guns to hand guns to sniper rifles are whipped up and pointed straight at his chest and head.  The effect is as though he is about to be blown entirely away. \nANGLE ON THE BARBER SHOP \nMoretti rushes out, screaming to the cop with Howard. \nMORETTI Don't fire! \nTHE RADIO NETWORK SCREAMS \nRADIO VOICES Did he say fire?  What fire?  Do we fire or what?  Who fired? (Etc.) \nVARIOUS COPS \nConfusion reigns.  They don't know if the perpetrator or not, since they haven't yet seen Sal or Sonny.  Guns  are up, aimed, being pushed down... Cops run for better vantage points. \nANGLE ON HOWARD \nas Moretti reaches him.  He pulls the cop away from him and starts to give him hell for the rough treatment being given the guard. \nANGLE IN DOOR OF BANK \nWith Sylvia in doorway, staring wildly at the street scene. Sonny is beside her covering her with his rifle. \nSYLVIA My God!  That's Howard!  We voted to send him out! \nVARIOUS ANGLES \nas the cops slowly realize their mistake.  They stand back from Howard, who is virtually catatonic with fear and shock now.  They get him up, a reluctant to believe they could have made such a mistake... \nANGLE ON TV CAMERAMAN \nNear barber shop, across the street, jockeying, trying to focus in on him, elbowing each other, they yell out: \nCAMERAMAN Hey!  Come out, get in the light. Hey, out where we can get a shot, huh?  Who's the black guy? (etc. AD LIBS) \nLOW ANGLE - HELICOPTER (TO AND FROM) \nswings in over street to try for a shot.  Howard is being taken in the direction of the barber shop. \nMORETTI \nto Cops. \nMORETTI Get him outta here! \nDOOR OF BANK \nSonny back in the shadows with Sylvia, looking at Moretti, appalled. \nON MORETTI \nBehind him a mob scene.  Howard is being led away, weeping. Photographers, cops, a phalanx of cops have their weapons levelled on Sonny like a firing squad.  It is right on the edge of violence... of blowing up.  Sonny and Sylvia are in the shelter of the doorway, Moretti stands on the sidewalk, looking toward Sonny inside the bank. \nMORETTI Sonny - come out here a minute. \nAt this point, he removes his jacket and drops it to the ground, showing Sonny that he is unarmed. \nSONNY You got these cops outta here. They're comin' in too close. \nHe hesitates in the doorway as the two women rush to the TV which is already on, the station showing live coverage of the bank robbery.  On SCREEN, Sonny can be seen ordering the cops around.  Moretti looks furious. \nON THE TV SET \nVI (as the recognizes Sonny) Oh, My God in Heaven! \nTV NEWSMAN ...the robber, whose identity is not known, came out of the bank, with a hostage, Mrs. Sylvia Ball... \nFAT WOMAN (proud) Did I tell you?  He looks good! \nIMAGE OF SYLVIA ON TV \nVI What's he doin' this for?  He didn't tell me he needed money.  He would of told me. \nTV NEWSMAN ...Mrs. Ball, is everyone all right in the bank? \nHUSBAND Why rob a bank when you got a sucker for a mother? \nSYLVIA Oh, yeah, the one girl was cryin', but we're havin' a ball, so far, if just nobody shoots... \nVI Why didn't he tell me? \nNEWSMAN What about the man inside the bank? What is he doing? \nHUSBAND I just hope he gives the wrong name. \nHe reaches for TV to turn it off.  Vi stops him. \nSYLVIA Sal?  He never talks, only goes: 'Sonny, you want me to shoot that one, this one.' \nHUSBAND Is that all there is -- that little bastard down there in the bank? \nTV NEWSMAN Mrs. Ball, do you think they might shoot, if they get desperate? \nVI You got money for the subway? \nSYLVIA Hey, wait, he's goin' back in. (she turns OUT OF PICTURE) \nFAT WOMAN Subway!  It's a special occasion -- take a cab, for God's sake! \nNEW IMAGE \nSonny returning toward bank. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nTWO SHOT - SONNY AND MORETTI \nas they shake hands.  As Sonny starts into the bank first, he holds the door open, waiting for Sylvia.  In the meantime, the 2nd-floor media man yells down to her. \nSYLVIA (looking up toward them) I gotta go now. \nMEDIA (2ND FLOOR) Hey, lady... you're out now.  Stay out! \nSonny, waiting patiently, holds door open for her. \nSYLVIA They're my girls.  They need me in there. \nAnd she walks through the door past Sonny and into the bank. Moretti yells up at the media to get the hell away and at the same time, turns to a nearby cop and gives orders for the air conditioning to be turned off inside the bank. \nAs the crowd realizes what has happened, they APPLAUD and SCREAM.  At the door: \nANGLE IN BANK DOOR \nas Sonny turns to grin and wave back at crowd. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANK - DAY \nas Sonny and Sylvia walk into bank and head for the group at the rear.  Mulvaney is seated at his desk, but the rest of the girls are standing around the vault area. \nSylvia heads for the girls as Sonny walks toward Sal. \nSYLVIA Hey, girls -- I was on television... \nMULVANEY (to passing Sonny) What about Howard? \nSonny makes reassuring gesture to let him know Howard is safe. \nSONNY (to Mulvaney) Turn on the TV. \nMulvaney turns on the TV set.  In the meantime, Sylvia has reached the other girls. \nGIRLS What happened? \nAnd Sylvia begins to recount the events out on the street, mainly about herself as a television celebrity. \nANGLE ON TV SET \nas we see the image of a TV NEWSMAN across the street.  Then, as his director CUTS, we will see on the TV set an \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen, our transmission has been temporarily interrupted. Please stand by. \nSonny hangs up the phone, looks at Mulvaney, puzzled at the outcome of the conversation. \nSONNY Why the hell did he do that?  What the hell did I do? \nMULVANEY I guess he didn't appreciate your use of language.  They don't speak that way on television.  It's a rule. Do you realize you've cut off a valuable source of communication? \nSonny now moves over to Sal. \nSONNY Okay, Sal... what do we do? \nSAL (no answer) \nSONNY I figure maybe we can get the FBI to make a deal... \nSAL What kind of a deal? \nSONNY Maybe we can get outta this thing alive... get 'em to drop the kidnapping charges... \nSAL What do you mean?  You talkin' about coppin a plea? \nSONNY (starts to speak, but Sal interrupts) \nSAL ...because if you're talking about coppin' a plea, I'm tellin' you right now, there's no deal... I'm never going back to prison... We got our own deal already... Do you remember the pact we made?  You and me and Jackie - that night in the bar... we were talkin' about if we get trapped in the bank, what are you gonna do... Right?  What did we say?  What did we say! \nSONNY We'd kill ourselves. \nSAL Does that still go? \nPHONE RINGS. \nSONNY We're not there yet. \nPHONE CONTINUES TO RING. \nSonny now walks over to the ringing phone on Edna's desk. Jenny, sitting on top of the desk, thinks the call is from her husband, starts to reach for it but as she does, Sonny grabs it away from her. \nSONNY You're on the phone! \n1ST CRANK (V.O.) Kill them all.  Now. \nIt's a heavy adhesive voice that can be heard clearly throughout the bank. \nSONNY Kill them all now?  You fuckin' creep! Don't call here again! \nSonny slams down the receiver, looks around at the group. \nSONNY You see what we're dealing with? They want me to kill all of you! \nMULVANEY What now, Sonny? \nSONNY Wait a minute... I've been looking at this all wrong... Let's look at it the other way... \nHe crosses over to Sal. \nSONNY Look, we gotta get a jet outta here... outta the country.  We gotta get a helicopter.  Okay, Sal?  We get a helicopter on the roof to take us to the jet and we fly to the sunny Caribbean.  Algeria.  We got to look at the bright side.  We got 'em by the balls, we got the hostages, we can get anything we want.  They gotta give it to us. \nEdna exits ladies room as Sonny crosses back to the phone, picks it up. \nSONNY (into phone) Get me Moretti. \nNow Sonny turns and speaks to the group. \nSONNY We're all gonna get outta here. You're all gonna be all right.  I'm gonna ask for a helicopter and a jet... and we're gonna get outta here alive... You've all been all right with me and as long as it stays that way, then things are gonna be all right - as long as you cooperate... (into phone) Moretti, I want to talk to you.  I'm comin' out. \nSonny slams the phone down and walks over to Sal, rifle still in his hands. \nSONNY You realize, Sal, that we're gonna get outta the country, so if you wanna talk to somebody, do it now... You gotta Mother or a Father? Friends? (Sal nods no) If we gotta be outside the country, where do you wanna go?  Any country. Just name a country. \nSAL Wyoming. \nSONNY (stopped for a moment) Wyoming... That's not out of the country -- that's in the United States... Look, I'll be back. \nSonny starts to walk toward the door.  As he does, Sal calls back to him. \nSAL Sonny!  Gimme the gun.  You don't need that. \nSonny realizes what he's saying and crosses back to Sal and hands him the gun, then moves toward the front door. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nMuch as before.  Sonny steps out.  The guns start to come up. \nSONNY Put them down. \nThe Cops lower their weapons.  Moretti comes out on the sidewalk.  He's eating an ice cream bar, and stands seemingly at ease, an island of calm control in a storm of passion about to be let loose.  The Cops are always about to explode. \nMORETTI Sonny, ya want somethin'? \nSonny is about to open his mouth when a medium-size dark- haired Man who has been standing among people behind the barriers puts his head down and runs at astonishing speed right across the street towards Sonny.  He catches everybody so by surprise he is already on Sonny before anyone can do more than start to yell at him to stop.  Sonny, himself, can't believe it!  He is slammed to the ground and the Man begins to punch him and beat him viciously.  Cops charge in and with great difficulty pull him off. \nThe cops, safely distanced and back in cover, peek out at: \nBANK DOOR \nIt is okay. \nRADIO NETWORK (V.O.) What's happening?  He shot through the door.  Is he coming out?  Can you see in... (Etc., etc.) \nON MORETTI \nreaches out his hand for a bullhorn that is thrust into it immediately. \nMORETTI (on bullhorn) Sonny! \nA few louts in the crowd yell out in imitation: \nLOUTS Sonny! \nMORETTI Sonny! \nCROWD (echoing) Sonny! \nMoretti shrugs off his irritation and raises the bullhorn one more time: the crowd is ready and SCREAMS in unison as Moretti says: \nMORETTI & CROWD Sonny! \nYou could hear it for a half a mile! \nSonny starts to yell at Moretti. \nSONNY (inside bank) What the hell you doin' back there? \nMORETTI Sonny, come on out! \nSonny walks over to Sal, gives him the rifle. \nSONNY Sal, watch 'em... I'm goin' out. \nANGLE ON BANK \nas Sonny comes charging out. \nSONNY What the fuck do you want? \nMORETTI They were... \nSONNY You tryin' to fuck me? \nMORETTI No, I'm not tryin' to fuck you. \nSONNY So, what were they doin'?  You're tellin' me you had nothin' to do with that back there? \nMORETTI I swear to God I had nothing to do with it... \nSONNY Bullshit... I don't walk to talk to you... \nMORETTI Wait a minute... everything you asked for is on the way... \nSONNY Yeah... \nMORETTI Is on its way... The helicopter can't land but we got a bus... the jet's on its way to Kennedy... we got a bus coming here... \nSONNY You're full of shit... \nMORETTI Sonny, your wife's on the way...  We reached her... your wife's on the way... everything you asked for, you got. \nSONNY Well, what were you doin' back there? \nMORETTI It can't happen again... I'll do everything I can to stop anything I can... \nSONNY You know, you're telling me that a helicopter can't land here... \nMORETTI Can't land... you'd kill people... \nSONNY Don't fuck with me... \nMORETTI I'm not... I'm not... you're gettin' a bus... you're gettin' a bus... the jet's comin' into Kennedy... and your wife's on the way... what else do you need?  What else can I get you?  Listen, I don't know how you can do better...  see that man over there... the FBI guy... \nSONNY Just one more explosion like that and you're gonna see a dead body... \nMORETTI There won't be... there won't be... What else do you need?  How else can we help you? \nSONNY All right... I got some hungry people in there... I want to get some pizza... some stuff like that... \nMORETTI What else? \nSONNY Cokes, seven-ups... (Moretti repeats) also some aspirin... \nMORETTI Aspirins... okay you got it. (turns behind him to a near-by cop) Charlie!  Six pizzas! \nSONNY Okay... \nSONNY Is he all right?  Is he all right? \nMORETTI (V.O.) He's all doped up. \nSONNY I want to talk to him. \nMORETTI (V.O.) He's groggy, Sonny.  Let me get him on his feet and he'll call you back. (hangs up) \nINT. BARBERSHOP \nas Moretti hangs up phone and walks over to Leon, who now has a glass of water and a cold towel. \nMORETTI Leon?  Whatsa matter?  They give you a shot down the hospital or what? \nLEON Oh, God, they shot me with like unreal! \nMORETTI Well, you got to get hold of yourself. You got to talk to him, tell him to give himself up. \nLEON Oh no! \nMORETTI He's got eight people in there with him.  He's got this kid with him... they're gonna shoot the people. \nLEON I can't help it.  I can't stop him from anything. \nMORETTI If he won't listen to you, who will he listen to? \nLEON He won't listen to anybody.  He's been very crazy all summer.  Since June he's been trying to kill me. \nMORETTI You try calling the police? \nLEON What good is that?  They couldn't stop him.  And it'd just make him mad.  They don't know him. \nMORETTI Somebody's got to stop him, Leon. \nLEON He was under great strain: you don't understand, he's a very mixed up person. \nMORETTI He's makin' threats in there. \nLEON He's scared.  It's crazy.  I never met anyone like him.  His wife, he's a wonderful father to his children. His mother - you should see her - his mother and father together are like a bad car wreck - he lets it all slide off his back, he sees them, he pays their rent.  Unbelievable. I wanted to get married... He didn't really want it... he's married already!  But he did it.  I don't know why.  I thought it would help me, but it didn't.  I was just as confused and unhappy was before; I did terrible things. \nMORETTI What kind of things, Leon? \nLEON Ten days I spent in Atlantic City - Sonny was frantic - he knew I was drinking; he didn't know where I was... who I was with.  I couldn't explain why I did the things I did. So I went to this psychiatrist who explained to me I was a woman in a man's body.  So Sonny right away wanted to get me money for a sex change operation: but where was he to get that?  2500 dollars!  My God, he's in hock up to his ears already. \nMORETTI He needed money?  For the operation for you? \nLEON It made him crazy - so much demand, he'd fly into this rages.  And I got more depressed than ever; I saw I'd never get the operation.  So I tried to take my life - I swallowed about a half pound of pills...  blues, reds, yellows, downers, uppers, screamers... you name it.  But I just threw them up and wound up in the hospital.  Sonny comes there and looks at me and just says: 'Wow!' So when I hear he's in the bank, I almost go crazy because I know he's doin' it for me. \nMORETTI Well, don't you figure you owe to him to get him out of there? \nLEON I can't talk to him. \nMORETTI You're in it up to your ass, Leon. You're an accessory.  You talk him out of there and they might be a little more understanding of your case. \nLEON I'm afraid. \nMORETTI How is he gonna hurt you on the telephone? \nLEON I don't know what to say to him.  I can't. \nMORETTI You think it over, Leon. \nMoretti walks over to the wall phone, picks up the receiver, and waits to be connected with the bank and Sonny. \nON LEON \nTerrified.  He really can't do it. \nON MORETTI \nwaiting. \nOMITTED \nINT. BANK - TURNING DARK NOW \nas the phone rings.  Sonny picks it up, hears Moretti's voice. \nMORETTI (V.O.) He won't talk to you.  Let me work on it. \nSonny hangs up.  He and Sal walk toward the group at the rear, around the desks. \nANGLE ON TELEVISION SCREEN \nas we see TV newsman speaking. \nTV NEWSMAN ...police are questioning Leon, a year-old admitted homosexual, who claims to have been married to one of the bank robbers in a ceremony last November... [etc.]... \nDuring the speech, Sylvia and her group wander toward Mulvaney's desk to listen, as Edna wanders down from the Conference Room, crosses to the set and turns up the volume. \nON SONNY \nSHELDON (showing ID) No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny. \nSONNY (sarcastically) Aw, Jesus... you been doin' us favors all night! \nSHELDON I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages. \nSONNY Bullshit! \nSHELDON I'd like to work with you on this, not against you. \nSonny comes around, looking for Moretti: can't see him. \nSONNY Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive. \nSHELDON Okay, when do I get them? \nSONNY At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out.  Except one. \nSHELDON I want them all. \nSONNY I want to talk to Leon. \nPause, while Sheldon thinks this over. \nSHELDON I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay. \nSONNY You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out? \nSHELDON I have to see. \nSonny re-enters bank. \nINT. BANK - NIGHT \nSonny goes over to Sal. \nSONNY It's the FBI.  He wants to come in. \nSAL Have him walk in backwards. \nSonny exits bank. \nEXT. BANK - NIGHT \nSonny crosses to Sheldon, grins, grabs him and executes a very professional-looking pat-down search. \nHe removes Sheldon's .38 from a shoulder holster, producing it for the crowd with a flourish like a magician: some of the old playfulness returns for a moment.  He carefully and with showbiz flourishes searches Sheldon's thighs and groin. The crowd HOWLS.  Sheldon bears it with stoic calm. \nCLOSE TWO SHOT \nas Sonny stands up from the search and finds Sheldon's eyes locked to his with flat calm. \nSONNY Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too. \nSHELDON I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to. \nSONNY Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go... but you gotta walk in backwards. \nThe move toward the door of the bank, where Sonny opens the door, preceding Sheldon, both men entering backwards. \nINT. BANK - NIGHT \nExcept for the 4 emergency lights, it is very dark - and very hot as Sonny and Sheldon enter the bank.  Sal now stands behind the desks, covering Sheldon and the group assembled at the vault.  Sheldon takes in every detail as he walks toward the group in the rear, followed closely and covered by Sonny.  As they near the desks, Sonny yells out an order for the group: \nSONNY Nobody give their right name... it's the FBI! \nSHELDON I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here. \nTWO SHOT - SYLVIA AND SAL \nShe's pissed. \nSYLVIA Listen, we asked for the jet hours ago, what are you doin' out there? \nSheldon is watching Sal, trying to gauge him.  This is the first time anyone from outside has seen Sal. \nSHELDON (his eyes on Sal) It's all being set up, we'll have you out of here in a couple of hours. \nSYLVIA (to Sheldon) Just give them what they want. \nSheldon now walks closer to group, looking into the two small examining rooms as he moves.  Sonny covers him every inch of the way. \nSHELDON They're getting what they want.  We just want to be sure we get what we want, which is to get all you ladies out safe.  And you two boys, too. \nSheldon is now standing very close to Sal. \nSAL (to Sheldon) You got to talk to the TV, tell them to stop talking about the two homosexuals.  I'm not gay...  that's the truth.  Tell 'em that. \nSHELDON I will. (he turns to Sonny) Sonny?  Outside for a minute? \nSONNY Sal? \nSonny rushes in.  The phone rings.  He picks it up. \nSONNY Hello.  Hello, Leon. \nLEON Hello, Sonny. \nSONNY How are you doing? \nLEON Well... I'm out of the hospital. \nSONNY (pleased) Yeah.  You said... I thought you were never getting out? \nLEON I never thought I'd get out this way.  I'll tell you. \nSONNY Well... huh... \nLEON Ooohh... \nSONNY Oh... huh... how you feeling? \nLEON I'm really shakey. \nSONNY Well, you know... Moretti told me before that you were drugged up. \nLEON Yeah.  It was terrible. \nSONNY That... huh... they just shoot you with drugs. \nLEON You come in and they say, right away, that you are crazy.  And they start putting things in your arm...  you know.  How do they expect you to get uncrazy if you're asleep all the time? \nSONNY Yeah... \nLEON You can't talk or do anything.  You really feel... you know... I'm just sort of coming out of it now. \nSONNY (pensive) So... that sure is something. \nLEON Yeah.  So how are you? \nSONNY (chuckling) Fine, thank you.  I'm in trouble. That is... now I am! \nLEON (chuckling) Yeah... I know. \nSONNY I don't know what I'm gonna do... you know.  Boy... I'm dying. \nLEON What?  What are you talking about? You are dying?  Did you ever listen to yourself when you say that? \nSONNY What are you talking about? \nLEON What do you mean... what am I talking about?  Do you realize that you say that to me every day of your life? I am dying.  Do you know... do you realize the death that you are spreading around to the people who are around you? \nSONNY Now don't give me that deep shit now.  Don't start with that shit. \nLEON No really... I don't think that you realize what it means.  The things that you do, Sonny.  You put a gun to somebody's head... \nSONNY I don't know what I'm doing. \nLEON (annoyed) Yeah... obviously you don't... when you put a gun to somebody's head... and you say go to sleep so that it won't hurt when I pull the trigger. Death?  Don't talk about death to me.  I have been living with death for the last six months.  Why do you think I'm in the hospital?  I take a handful of pills to get away from you.  And then here I am out of the hospital talking to you on the phone... again.  I have no friends left.  No job.  I can't live.  I have to live with people.  This death business... I'm sorry! \nSONNY I'm not on the phone to talk to you about that.  Well, I don't know what to say, Leon.  When you gimme that... when you hit me with that shit.  I mean, what am I supposed to say? \nLEON (indifferent to Sonny) I'm sorry... \nSONNY I told you.  That I got a lot of pressures.  You said to me that you needed money, and I knew that you needed money!  I saw you there lying in the hospital like that...  and I said... shit, man, I got to get this guy some money. \nLEON (excited) But I didn't ask you to go rob a bank. \nSONNY (getting louder) All right.  I know you didn't ask me.  You didn't ask me but I did it. \nLEON Well... \nSONNY I did it on my own.  I did this all on my own.  I ain't laying it on anybody.  Nothing on anybody.  I'll tell you something, though, it's about time that I squared away my accounts... you know.  I am squaring away my accounts with life.  Maybe this whole thing is gonna end, somehow.  Maybe it'll just end! Maybe I'll just close my eyes and the whole fucken thing will be over. That would be all right too!  I said... I thought I would square it away with you... you know?  That I would get you down here and that I would say so long to you... or, if you wanted... you know, to take a trip... \nLEON What trip? \nSONNY I'm getting out of here, man.  I'm not going to stay here and I'm not giving up.  I mean, huh, they're going to kill me, anyway.  So fuck it!  But, if I can get out of this... I am going to get out.  And, how I'm going to do it is to get a jet out of here and I'm flying the fuck out... That's all, Leon.  If you want to come with me, then you're entitled... you can come.  You're free to do what you want. \nLEON I'm free to do what I want?  And you think I would want to go with you some place on a plane?  Where? Where ya going? \nSONNY I gotta jet coming here and we're gonna try to get the fuck outta this thing.  And we're gonna go, man! \nLEON You're crazy. \nSONNY That's it. \nLEON You're really crazy. \nSONNY I know! \nLEON Where you gonna go? \nSONNY Who the fuck knows?  I think we're gonna go... we worked it out to Algeria.  So, I don't know.  So I'll go to Algeria. \nSONNY Do you still want the operation? \nLEON (moody) Yeah... yeah. \nSONNY Well, then... \nLEON It's my only chance! \nSONNY I don't know what to say to ya!  I guess I just wanted to say I'll see ya... or whatever. \nLEON Thank you much... and huh, bon voyage. \nSONNY Right.  See you sometime. \nLEON Yeah... see ya in my dreams, huh? \nSONNY Yeah... I'll write a song.  Ha, ha. I don't know.  Life is funny! \nLEON You said a mouthful... sweetheart! \nINT. BANK \nSonny hangs up, walks back toward rear of bank and picks up receiver again on Edna's desk. \nSONNY (into phone) You cut off incoming, gimme a line. I want to talk to my wife, I want to say goodbye to my kids. (line is connected, he begins to dial; anguished; to the group) Here I am, I could call, and they'd put anybody on the phone, the Pope, an astronaut, the wisest of the wise and who do I have to call? (to phone; as she answers) Heidi? \nHEIDI'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe TV is on, the kids up and racing around, neighbors pouring beer -- An event! \nHEIDI (on phone; excited) Hey, Sonny!  I'm watchin' it on TV! \nON SONNY \nSONNY What about the kids? \nON HEIDI \nHEIDI They don't know, I sent them to the neighbors.  Sonny, Jesus, it's not like you.  I can't believe, because you never hurt anybody since the day I knew you. \nON SONNY \nSONNY Heidi, I'm dying. \nON HEIDI \nHEIDI (oblivious) I blame myself, Sonny.  I notice you been tense, like something is happening; the night before last you're yellin' at the kids like a madman, believe me.  And then you wanted me to go on this ride with the kids, this caterpillar about from here to there - fulla one-year- old kids.  It's ridiculous.  I'm not about to go on this ride, so you yell right there, 'You pig, get on the fuckin' ride!' Well, everything fell outta - me - my heart, my liver fell to the floor - you name it! Yellin' at me in front of all those people.  Because you never talked and I never been scared of you, never. I think: he's gonna shoot me and dump my body in the river. \nON SONNY \nSONNY Heidi, for Christ sake, shut up! Will you shut your fucking mouth and listen?! \nON HEIDI \nHEIDI (afraid) See?  You're screaming with the language and all!  A person can't communicate with you.  You become a stranger in your own home... \nON SONNY \nhe sits, dispiritedly listening to this rap: seeing her in a clear and unambiguous light as before he saw Leon: what a waste to live in the company of people like this! \nON HEIDI \nHEIDI ...because you hurt me, God how you hurt me.  Can you imagine, marrying another man?  Did I do something to make you do that?  Did I ever turn you down, or anything?  The only thing I couldn't do, you're gonna laugh, is go on top - I got this fear of high places! (giggles) And I let myself get fat. \nON SONNY \nSONNY Don't call yourself fat. \nON HEIDI \nHEIDI I know you can't stand me to say I'm fat.  Like I can't stand you being a bank robber.  I guess that's what love is -- huh, Sonny? \nON SONNY \nSONNY (weakly) Heidi - why didn't you come down here? \nON HEIDI \nHEIDI Jesus - what - I'm afraid - I'm gonna get shot or whatever.  You oughta see it on TV, the guns, the cops, they got cannon, machine guns, they're loaded with gear. \nON SONNY \nSONNY They're not after you, they're after me. \nON HEIDI \nHEIDI Listen, it's late already when I realize it's not just a couple of ordinary faggots, it's just you and Sal.  I couldn't get a baby sitter. \nHeidi goes on and on, but Sonny just drops the phone on the hook.  As he walks toward the rear of the bank, Sylvia, seated atop Margaret's desk, gets off and follows Sonny toward the Conference room.  At the same time, Edna is lifting Margaret's feet up onto a chair and Jenny and Deborah start to walk toward the Conference room, too.  Maria paces back and forth, transistor to her ear. \nSonny walks into the Conference room.  The doctor is through examining Mulvaney.  Miriam is seated across the table from him. \nSonny walks back toward Sal, who is seated in Conference Room. \nSONNY Hey, Sal... How you doin'? \nSAL Okay. \nSonny crosses back downstage again to Mulvaney and Sylvia. \nSONNY (referring to Sal) You know, I don't know him very well - but he's not gay... and he's not going back to prison...  One time when he was in prison, they gang- banged him; 13 years old and eight guys gave it to him...  So Sal isn't goin' back to prison, no way. \nMULVANEY I'm sorry. \nSONNY You know... I like you people... I really do. \nMULVANEY We like you, too. \nSONNY You know - I had a job once.  I used to work in a bank.  I had been training... I used to have a boss... Mr. Don Frio... he wore a toupee... I wonder if you'd hire me if I came in here and asked you for a job... \nMULVANEY Would I hire you? \nSONNY Yeah. \nMULVANEY Why not? \nSONNY (grinning) I don't think so. \nSonny walks back toward Sal. \nSONNY I told you -- they're sending a jet. It's all worked out... \nBut doubt hangs in the air like a pall... \nCLOSEUP - SAL \nlooking at him.  Implacable.  This tension between them over the question of Sonny's loyalty must be kept constantly alive with CUTS and looks, over dialogue... \nSYLVIA & MULVANEY \nSYLVIA Somebody give me another cigarette. \nSal turns to look at her reproachfully. \nON SYLVIA \nSYLVIA I wish somebody would tell me I'm gonna live long enough for it to be a habit.  My parent, she'll be okay. My husband, he'll be okay.  I even know who the bum is gonna marry. Terrific.  She'll take good care of him. \nMULVANEY Girls, I wanta apologize.  For my language back there. \nEmbarrassed, he walks toward the rest of group in the rear, stands by Edna's desk. \nMULVANEY Ladies... I want to apologize for my language back there. (he walks over to his desk, sits down) \nSonny exits Conference Room and moves downstage. \nSYLVIA (amazed) What'd you say?  I didn't hear you say anything. \nThey think for a moment. \nJENNY He said the 'F' word. \nThey stare at her incredulously. \nSomeone giggles. \nEDNA What? \nJENNY The 'F' word.  He did.  He said the 'F' word. \nEdna crosses to her desk - disgusted - and starts to tidy up. \nThe giggle catches the edge of their panic and anxiety and sweeps them into uncontrollable giggles and laughter: Sonny roars.  Sal and Edna alone remain unsmiling.  After a few seconds they force themselves to stop, to behave like they should under the circumstances.  They are gasping and crying. Then... \nSONNY What's so funny? \nEDNA Well, I'm a Christian, and my ears are not garbage cans. \nIt sets them off again.  They howl and giggle and laugh. \nUntil at last they run down again.  At this point, Sal rushes out of Conference Room. \nSAL Who's that? \nHe has seen something in the middle of the street, and now... \nNEW ANGLE \nas they all turn to look out through the door. \nTHEIR POV \nBacklighted by the floodlights in the middle of street escorted by Sheldon, stands a figure, dumpy and gray, tentatively waving, a figure that bends over baby carriages in the park, picks beans one by one out of supermarket bins, lip reads get-well cards in pharmacies. \nMaria and Miriam are still dancing; Margaret is at her desk; Sal, Jenny and Deborah are in the Conference Room; Sylvia is still behind Tellers' Cages. \nSONNY Mister Mulvaney? \nMULVANEY Yeah? \nSONNY Are you a lawyer? \nMULVANEY No.  I had some legal training, but... \nSONNY I want to dictate my will.  I need a notary? \nSYLVIA I'm a notary. \nShe leaves Tellers' Cages area, crosses to Sonny, grabbing a pen from Edna's desk on the way.  Sonny's urgent mood reaches them.  Sylvia gets note pad from Mulvaney.  Takes the dictation... \nSONNY Being of sound mind and body, and all that shit... \nSylvia nods: got it. \nSONNY To my darling wife Leon whom I love as no other man has loved another man in all eternity, I leave $2,700 from my $10,000 life insurance policy, to be used for your sex change operation.  If there is money left over it is to go to you on the first anniversary of my death, at my grave. I expect you to be a real woman then, and your life full of happiness and joy.  To my sweet wife, Heidi, five thousand from the same policy.  You are the only woman I have ever loved, and I re-pledge my love to you in this sad moment, and to little Kimmy and Jimmy.  I hope you remember me, Jimmy.  You are the little man of the family now, and will have to look after them for me.  To my mother I ask forgiveness.  You don't understand the things I did and said, but I'm me, and I'm different.  I leave you, the rest of the policy and my stamp collection.  I want a military funeral and am entitled to one free of charge.  Life and love are not easy and we have to bend a lot.  I hope you find the places and the people to make you all happy as I could not.  God bless you and watch over you, as I shall, until we are joined in the hereafter, sweet Leon, my Heidi, dearest Kimmy and Jimmy, and my mother.  Sonny... here I'll spell the last name... \nHe sits and writes it for Sylvia. \nSONNY Type that up and I'll sign it. \nNobody says anything about this document.  What is there to say?  Sylvia walks to her desk at the front of the bank, near the window, and begins typing. \nEXT. BANK - VARIOUS ANGLES - NIGHT \nThe restless crowd STIRS, sensing something happening. Turning to see something coming. \nAPARTMENT FIRE ESCAPE \nThe Cops gear up their weapons: radios CRACKLE.  Something, a vehicle, is moving through the crowd, Cops shoving people aside to let it through.  The Old Lady pays no attention. \nShe is down to one of the very last pieces of the puzzle and is searching for the spot for it. \nLOW ANGLE IN CLEAR PLACE IN FRONT OF BANK \nas the vehicle clears the crowd and slowly draws up in front. \nIt is a long airport limousine of the type with many doors. \nIt stops.  Everyone's attention is on it.  A black DRIVER gets out, a gay Afro knit on his head, coke dealer's shades, for the cognoscenti, one very long little finger nail, a nifty Van Dyke style beard and one gold front tooth.  He looks around, holding a sheet of paper.  Sheldon, others, approach.  They are looking into the vehicles, opening doors, checking tires, etc. \nDOOR OF BANK \nSonny appears.  He strides to the limo. \nSONNY Okay.  Get away from it. \nAfter a moment the Cops all move back.  Sonny opens the front door and begins to check it out.  The Driver starts to move away... \nSONNY These seats come out? \nDRIVER Yeah. \nINT. LIMO - CLOSE - SONNY AND DRIVER \nTogether they remove the seat so Sonny can check for guns concealed below, etc.  Improvise to fit conditions of the car. \nDRIVER (dawning on him) Jesus, you're the man! \nSONNY Come on, what's under this? \nThey pry up a seat and look under, etc., all through: \nDRIVER I was lookin' at it.  I saw you, man!  Jesus!  You oughta see yourself! You wouldn't believe it. \nSONNY Yes, I would. \nDRIVER God damn it, Sheila isn't gonna believe it.  They just call in and say gas up a stretchout and get it down to (address in Brooklyn) and I say, 'shit, another load of Elks for the massage parlors.' \nSONNY (finished) Okay. \nDriver stands up, getting a good look at Sonny. \nDRIVER Well, by God I'm gonna remember you! \nAnd he turns and walks away. \nDriver stops, uncertainly.  Cops grab him to hustle him away. Sheldon steps forward with a neat twenty-years-younger carbon copy of himself... \nSHELDON Here's your driver, this is agent Murphy. \nNEW ANGLE Sonny and Murphy.  Sonny eyes Murphy, thinks, then begins to frisk Murphy. He finds nothing. \nHe stands up and eyes Murphy.  He just doesn't like it. \nSONNY I don't want him. \nSONNY You got Bank Americard? \nMULVANEY (tired) What now, Sonny? \nSONNY (gathers money from near-by money bag) Listen, I owe a couple hundred dollars!  I don't wanta leave owing anybody anything!  A clean slate, a new leaf... \nHe plunks his card down before Sylvia. \nSONNY (continuing) I paying off. (money from attached case) Here.  Two hundred should do it. \nThey start the action of filing the form and accepting the money... Sonny stops them... \nSONNY Just give me a receipt.  Hey, Sal, you okay? \nSAL (deep in his hair or tie or?) Okay, Sonny. \nSONNY All right. (accepts receipt) \nSYLVIA Here's your document, Sonny. \nSONNY Yeah - it looks real official. \nThey are ready.  A moment in the dark.  Sonny holds out the will to Mulvaney. \nSONNY Hold it for me? \nMulvaney takes it.  Sonny shakes his hand.  Suddenly, emotionally, he embraces Sylvia.  Suddenly they are all saying silent goodbyes.  Shaking hands all around, formally. \nOnly Sal is left untouched, standing apart, watching them, in the dark. \nEXT. BANK - NIGHT \nEveryone waits in silence.  The lights.  The limo.  The Driver waiting in the driver's seat.  After a beat the door begins to open. \nVARIOUS ANGLES \nas Cops' guns are brought to bear.  On the apartment fire escape the Old Lady is asleep, her puzzle complete.  The snipers raise their rifles. \nFRONT OF BARBER SHOP - NIGHT \nSheldon stands there.  The police radio network CRACKLES: \"They're coming out.  Perpetrators and hostages together. Only authorized personnel may previously authorized, and etc.\"  Sheldon's eyes go to: \nHIS POV - SNIPER \nA middle-aged Man who looks like an overweight accountant, in flak vest and helmet that seems too small, aiming through a telescopic sight at: \nDOOR OF BANK \nSONNY (letting Murphy out first; yells outside) Get away from the car! \nSomething that looks like a multi-legged animal emerges.  It is Sonny and Sal in the center of a tight group of the girls and Mulvaney, so they are completely protected on all sides by hostages.  Over their heads is thrown some drapes from the bank that further prevent the police from drawing a clear head on Sonny or Sal without hitting a girl.  In fact they can't be seen at all.  This weird apparition appears, hesitates.  The crowd YELLS: \"SHOOT!\"  CHOREOGRAPH THE ACTION so the group hesitates, takes a step forward, then it's clear Sonny can't see well enough to go direct to the car, and the girls are uncertain which direction to go in, not having been briefed.  So they stumble about, make false starts, and finally arrive at the car, where one girl gets into the second row of seats behind the Driver.  Then Sonny slides across next to Driver. \nVARIOUS ANGLES TO COVER \nThe police have no chance to shoot.  The group looks like a bewildered centipede finding its way.  Mulvaney detaches himself from the group and slips into the front seat, on Sonny's right. \nON EDNA \nstanding alone, outside filled-up limo.  Sheldon walks over to Mulvaney's window. \nSONNY (to Sheldon) Okay - you got your one. \nSHELDON (to Murphy) You follow my car. (he moves off) \nMaria gets in the rear-most row of seats.  Sal next to her in the middle and then another girl.  One woman, Edna, a plain middle-aged woman who has not said a word until now is left over.  She stands by the side of the limo as the doors close and this phase of the operation ends, without mishap. \nSONNY (elated) Fuck!  We did it! \nSYLVIA (to Edna) Goodbye, honey.  Wish us luck! \nEdna pecks out dry little kisses to the nearest girls. \nANGLE THROUGH SONNY'S DOOR WINDOW \nas Edna pecks... goodbye. \nSONNY I'll be a son of a bitch -- we're all okay!  Hey, man!  Honk the horn. Let's go! \nSal has his gun pointed on back of Driver's head. \nMURPHY Hey, Sal - do me a favor... point that gun up, huh?  We hit a bump and the fuckin' gun'll go off. \nThe Driver honks the HORN: they're ready.  The crowd SCREAMS. \nCops keep jockeying for position, but there is no way to get a shot in. \nON SHELDON \nNo emotion.  He steps into his car, a police car pulls up behind, and the procession starts to pull slowly toward the crowd. \nON EDNA AND BANK \nMARIA I pray for your safety... (meaning Sonny and Sal) ...Sal?  Because I know it's your first plane trip.  Don't be scared, you know? (gives him her rosary) \nAnd Maria walks away.  Now the plane has taxied into position, where it can be seen in floodlights.  It looks big and impressive.  We know the FBI has snipers ringing it. \nSONNY I ain't eaten all day.  I just realized it. \nSHELDON We'll have hamburgers on the plane. You ready? \nMURPHY (turns to Sal again) Sal, keep it up, huh?  The gun - please... \nCLOSE - SONNY \nlooking at the plane, grasping his money and his gun.  The rifle stands straight up between his legs.  Sheldon leans down, peering in at him. \nSONNY What do you think, Sal?  You ready to go? \nANGLE - SAL \nin front of Sonny, behind Mulvaney.  For the first time he smiles.  He realizes that escape is within their grasp.  The smile transforms him from a formidable Mafia imitation into an utterly sweet and defenseless youth. \nSAL (gun pointing high) Hey, Sonny - You did it! \nCLOSE - SONNY \nSONNY Let's move it, goddamn it. \nSHELDON (to Driver) You ready to get out first? \nDRIVER Yes. \nDriver starts to turn in the driver's seat! \nSheldon brings up his hands to reach through the open window to grab Sonny's rifle barrel, pushes it away, aiming out windshield. \nMulvaney sees them beginning their move and starts to duck. \nSal begins to see movement out of the corner of his eyes and is barely beginning to react. \nDRIVER TURNING HAS A GUN OVER THE BACK OF THE SEAT! \nSonny sees it, and Sheldon's hand grabbing the barrel of his gun at the same moment. \nSheldon drives hard into the side of the limo, reaching in. \nMulvaney grabs the girl next to him and pulls her by the hair down toward the floor. \nSal, open-mouthed with amazement, is a split-second late bringing his gun up. \nDriver completes his turn and has his gun leveled at Sal between Miriam and Margaret in middle row. \nSheldon grabs his rifle barrel and pulls hard.  Sonny lets it go. \nSal stares at the gun barrel, trying to get his gun up... \nDriver FIRES. \nMulvaney hits the floor. \nSheldon holds Sonny's gun. \nSonny, CLOSE, watches. \nSal, hit, slams back into the seat; the gun flies upward. Another SHOT hits him, flinging his head back. \nDriver holds his third shot, turns to Sonny - holds gun to his temple. \nSonny looks down so he can see fully as: \nSal's head snaps back for a split second and stares directly into Sonny's eyes, upside down. \nHe stares sadly, into Sonny's eyes.  As though he knew it all along -- betrayed. \nAnd dies. \nThe SHOT is ECHOING.  Now SCREAMS, YELLS, SLAMMING doors, panic... Sonny's voice:  \"Shoot me!  For God's sake, shoot me!\" \nFULL SHOT \nThey come pouring out of the limo, scrambling frantically away from it.  The limo -- the people fleeing it.  Agents pull people away from the car. \nDriver and Sheldon and Cops peer into the back.  Sal's body lies slumped. \nDriver, Sheldon, other Cops stand about, recovering.  No one makes the slightest sort of congratulatory move, it was just another job.  Driver clears his weapon, hands it to Sheldon to be filed in case of investigation. \nON SYLVIA, MULVANEY, HOSTAGES \nThey hug, cry, laugh, jump up and down: they're alive! \nSYLVIA (to Mulvaney) I been dying to do this for years! \nAnd she kisses him hard in the mouth.  He laughs and kisses back... \n", "test1_input": "MULVANEY I don't care who you are... (shove) I just want to get you outta here, safe, right? \nSONNY What if I take you with me? \nMULVANEY (stopping to rest for a beat, thinking) If you take anybody, please take me. \nSONNY They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you... they don't give a damn. In spite of that bank insurance. You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty. \nThey have the machine almost to the door now, with Mulvaney almost pinned between the machine and the door.  He eases himself out.  Looks at the gun, then at Sonny, then they shove the machine against the door.  Sonny then gives Mulvaney his jacket to put on again. \nSONNY Anyway, I'm not gonna take you. I'm gonna take one of the girls, a married one with a couple of kids. The cops don't like it in the papers when they kill a mother, especially if she's got young kids. \nFinished with the task, Sonny takes his gun and with Mulvaney, they start to cross back toward Sal and the rest of the group. \nSONNY You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean? \nMULVANEY I don't fool around with you. \nMulvaney crosses back to his desk and sits down.  At this point, all the phones are off the hooks. \nEXT. (AERIAL) ANGLE FROM INT. POLICE HELICOPTER (OVER BANK) \nAs it banks steeply we can see past Pilot to bank, and cops around car.  We see a small crowd being held back by a few police still setting up barricades.  It is the first indication of the crowd event it became.  It also sets the geography for us, but very quickly another copter swims into view and the two circle each other.  The other copter -- only feet away -- is a TV news helicopter, with a big camera sticking out the open door on our side. \nIt is turned down by the Cameraman to focus on the bank.  A COP in the police helicopter yells through his bullhorn at the TV Cameraman. \nBULLHORN COP This is a restricted area.  You are flying in a restricted area... \nThe TV Cameraman swivels his camera up to focus on the Cop, and as the lens hits us dead center... \nINT. APARTMENT NEAR BANK \nThough an open window a fire escape can be seen and beyond it an angle of street and the bank.  Near the window in a corner is a TV set, and on the TV set we are seeing the shot of the police helicopter and the Cop yelling on the bullhorn as seen from the TV copter.  A couple of Elderly Men are sitting watching the TV set, ignoring the bank, which they can see in the flesh, as it were.  Outside we are HEARING the copters, and on the TV set likewise, and the voice of the Announcer. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...police as yet have made no contact with the bank robbers who are locked in the bank... \nThere is a HAMMERING at the door, and the men at the TV set barely have time to look around before several burly Cops wearing flak vests and helmets and carrying sniper rifles with telescopic slights move through the room, ignoring the men.  They move out onto the fire escape, a couple going up higher, settling themselves down to aim in their rifles on the front of the bank.  A lot of AD LIB dialogue, but what we note is the Cops, as a man, take a look at themselves on the TV. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nThe FRAME is full of cop faces... tough, mesomorphic faces with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age.  They have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing.  They are city cops; they don't have that old-fashioned condemnatory expression, there is an element of playfulness in their nature -- the fact is they love their work, which is criminals.  There is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it -- which is the action of repressing their own strongly developed criminal unconscious.  These are tense, funny, violent, and rigidly controlled men. \nMORETTI is an old-line cop, a lot more relaxed than the younger men and the cold professionals of the FBI, who as a group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not deny) the psychic chaos underneath. \nRight now they are looking at the sky.  We HEAR a heavy helicopter track. \nWe feature SHELDON, the silver-haired FBI Agent-in-Charge, who looks like an accountant, and Moretti, with hat and cigar, and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties.  In spite of Sheldon's age, Moretti plays though he's a smart kid who still needs a little help. \nSheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit. Three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages. \nThe three hang around him.  They approach Moretti who looks at them without moving. \nMORETTI (to no one) Here comes the FBI. (to Sheldon) You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here. \nSHELDON Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street? \nMoretti looks at him, cheerfully sarcastic. \nMORETTI I made an error in judgment.  I thought the sons of bitches would be overwhelmed with remorse at the sight of a police officer.  And you know somethin'?  Nobody has said hostage yet.  Unnastan? \nThey are moving past Cops on the corner heading toward a small barbershop across the street from the bank.  We now sense the growing crowd, standing quietly, just staring not yet knowing what's going on. \nNEW ANGLE \nFrom down the street come a group of odd-looking men in suits, carrying all kinds of electric junk: The NEW REPORTERS. They run heavily, sweating martinis and cigarette smoke... they run up to Moretti and Sheldon, who walk along, trying not to catch an eye. \nMOVING SHOT - MORETTI AND SHELDON AMONG NEWSMEN. \nVOICES How many in the bank? Have they got hostages?  Any shots exchanged? (Etc., AD LIB) \nMORETTI No, we don't know that yet.  This young fella without the hat is FBI. I'm Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti ... M-O-R-E-double-T-I.  Eugene.  I don't give a shit, but my wife cries if you spell it wrong. \nThey have arrived at the barber shop where Moretti fights his way inside. \nINT. BARBER SHOP - DAY \nA COP is talking on the wall phone as MORETTI, BAKER, etc. are trying to get inside. \nCOP ...no, just get hold of Al, tell him to get the catering truck over to 26th and Avenue B, there's a bank robbery in progress and big crowd. Big!  Tell him to bring ice cream -- I got to hang up. \nHe hangs up and immediately begins thumbing through a POCKET PHONE BOOK.  Throughout this Cop is engaged in personal business on the fringe of this affair, and though he's on duty he hardly knows what's happening on the robbery.  He's trying to get his brother-in-law with the ice cream truck down here, etc. \nMoretti has got the crowd cleared back, so that now we SEE why this has been chosen as a tactical command post.  From here, while talking on the phone, Moretti can see the bank, and through the uncurtained door he can even see some distance inside. \nMoretti picks up the phone. \nMORETTI (to phone cop) You get the phone company? \nPHONE COP It's being set up... this phone'll be a direct line into the bank. \nMoretti is already dialing.  The phone is answered. \n", "test1_true": "(Re Moretti's 3rd conversation on phone with Sonny.) \nThe group inside the bank have now been waiting approximately twelve minutes since anything last happened.  Sonny is seated at Mulvaney's desk, all the phones off the hooks. \nThe rest of the group is huddled around the vault area where Sal is keeping his eye on them. \nSuddenly, Sonny jumps up and puts all the receivers back on the hooks, crossing back to sit at Mulvaney's desk again. \nPHONE STARTS TO RING and Sonny picks it up. \nMORETTI Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now? \nSONNY I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now. \nMORETTI Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay. \nSONNY They're okay. \nMORETTI You alone, or you got confederates? \nSONNY I'm not alone. \nMORETTI How many you got in there? \nSONNY I got Sal. \nMORETTI Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore? \nSONNY Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand? \nA cop passing by presses a portable two-way radio into Moretti's hand: He accepts it and holds as though he expected it.  The Cop passes the same type of set to certain other officers.  These sets are tuned in to each other, and throughout the movie, there is a constant background talk on these sets.  This is police procedure; the orders are for everyone to talk about everything.  If anyone has a question, has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible surprises.  Sample dialogue might go: \"Did I hear a shot?\" \"Over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunshot, inside.\"  \"Roger, we heard that from the barbershop... it was inside the bank.\"  \"Barbershop, you can see inside?\" \"Roger, we heard from the barbershop... it was inside the bank.\"  \"Barbershop, you can see inside?\"  \"Roger, this is the barbershop, we see inside, the perpetrator is moving toward the rear of the bank.\"  \"Who's that guy walking through the barricade?\"  \"The blue suit?\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"Off-duty Inspector come down to see can you use him.\"  Etc.  They really do use the word Perpetrator, Felon, etc.  The Cop handing out radios makes Moretti sign for it -- which Moretti does during the following: \nMORETTI Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name? \nSONNY What do you want to know that for? \nMORETTI Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you. \nSONNY Call me Sonny-boy. \nMORETTI Sonny-boy, one word? \nSONNY One word.  You won't find it in the phone book. \nMORETTI Listen, Sonny... can I call you Sonny for short? \nSONNY Call me whatever you want. \nMORETTI Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess. \nSONNY I frisk you? \nMORETTI You frisk me. \nSONNY Right -- I'm with you, buddy. \nMORETTI I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight... right? \nSONNY Sure... like... I'm not gonna shoot you. \nMORETTI How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position? \nSONNY They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then. \nMORETTI Okay, give us the women. \nSONNY Oh, no... Women is all we got. \nMORETTI You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin'... Give me one of them, anyway... Just one... \nSONNY So -- you want me to send one out there... Okay.  I'll see what I can do. \nSonny hangs up and moves over to Sal.  The rest of the group has been trying to make out what's being said at the other end of the conversation. \nSONNY (to Sal) He wants one. \nSAL Dead or alive? \nSONNY Alive. \nNow Sonny looks at the group. \nSONNY Okay... who's gonna go first? \nMulvaney now stands up at his desk, looks over at the group near the vault.  They look back at him, waiting for some instructions. \nMULVANEY It's up to you ladies. \nSYLVIA Howard! \n", "test1_id": 3150, "test2_input": "INT. HEIDI'S APARTMENT - DAY \nChaos out of cut-rate furniture stores.  Full of unwashed glasses, kids' clutter.  Throughout, the children rush around unchecked.  Neighbors enter without ceremony and listen. The Cops stand, trying vainly to communicate... As they enter... \nHEIDI (continuing) And things are adding in my head, how crazy he's been acting, and in with a bad crowd, an' I look at him, he's yellin' at the kids like a madman.  So inna car I said to him, Sonny, what you gonna do with the gun?  You gonna shoot me and dump my body inna river or what?  I was so scared of him, I never been scared of Sonny never.  You know, his mother says the cops was always at our house, we was always fighting.  I hit him with the jack in the car once, but I only missed and hit myself, you should of seen my leg.  And all he would ever do is put on his coat and go out.  So they say it's Sonny but I don't believe it. \nCOP 1 Lady, you saw him.  You saw his gun. \nHEIDI He might of done it, his body functions might of done it, but not he himself. \nINT. BANK - LATE AFTERNOON - APPROX. 5 PM \nThe group is now situated like this: \n1) MULVANEY'S DESK - the TV is on; seated in his chair, filing her nails is MIRIAM. \nSeated to her left, having pulled the chair a patron uses, is MARIA, watching TV and listening to her transistor radio, against her left ear, at the same time. \nMULVANEY (at back water cooler - will eventually move back to his desk, sit down to Miriam's right.) \n2) EDNA - is now behind the Tellers' cages, straightening up the mess; she picks up the loose money that Sonny had scattered thru the air, puts them into packets and ties them with rubber bands. \n3) SAL - is seated in the rear Conference room, still holding his rifle, feet up on the table. \n4) MULVANEY & DEBORAH - at the rear water cooler (from which she will move to see what's wrong with Margaret) \n5) MARGARET - seated at her desk, obviously ill, wiping her forehead, head bowed. \n6) SYLVIA and JENNY - at far right table, doing a crossword puzzle. \n7) SONNY - pacing back and forth Mulvaney's desk, posing a legal puzzle for Maria. \nSonny, his gun now lying across the top of Mulvaney's desk, is pacing back and forth between the desk areas.  He's talking to Maria in particular, but anyone in earshot in general. \nSONNY Let's say I put a gun to your head and I tell you to kill a cop...  and you did.  Who'd go to the electric chair... you or me? \nMARIA You would... you told me to do it. \nSONNY But you shot him. \nMIRIAM (joining in) But you told her to. \nSONNY Yeah - But you did it. \nDeborah crosses to Margaret who is ill.  Deborah goes to Sylvia - who returns with her her to Margaret. \nIt should begin getting dark in through here.  It is very hot and sweaty in the bank.  OPEN SCENE ON: \nCLOSE MULVANEY ON PHONE \nHe is sweating, worried.  He is listening to a conversation we can HEAR... as it goes on SHOT WIDENS to reveal the others in various postures of waiting.  Sal more disheveled, Sonny's restlessness is unabated; he paces about like a caged animal. The voice on the phone is breathy and youthful: Sonny has been listening for a long time. \nJESUS FREAK (V.O.) Jesus Christ is coming back and he's really pissed. \nSONNY (gently) Yeah, well I don't blame him. \nJESUS FREAK (V.O.) You know, Sonny, I used to dope a lot, and I was into dipping?  And I did a couple bank jobs, and the Lord Jesus in his everlasting mercy saved me, you know how? \nSonny is desperate to get off the phone but doesn't dare risk the wrath of God by hanging up on this guy.  He might have the secret after all. \nSONNY No.  Look, we're kind of.... \nJESUS FREAK (V.O.) That's why I can talk to you, as an equal, Sonny.  You got to merge your whole soul with God.  And then you are Him and one with the Holy Ghost. \nSONNY Yeah, well... maybe you better talk to one of these others, okay? \nJESUS FREAK (V.O.) Sonny?  Don't send me away!  I can help you save your soul ... \nSonny hangs up.  Deborah moves to Margaret, who is ill.  She goes to tell Sylvia who immediately crosses to Margaret. \nANGLE ON MARGARET & SYLVIA \nSYLVIA The air conditioning is off or something. (Looks at Margaret) she's sick. \nSonny runs around, notices her - sees that air conditioner is off. \nSONNY Where's the air conditioning? \nMULVANEY I don't know, Sonny... on the roof somewhere I guess. \nSONNY (improv. about going out back to find the air conditioning mechanism) Sonny moves toward Sal in the Conference room.  Mulvaney follows discreetly behind him. \nSONNY Sal, I'm gonna take a look at the air conditioning. \nSonny and Mulvaney start to move out toward the back door area. \nSONNY (to Mulvaney) Do you think we can turn it on? \nMULVANEY I don't know. \nAt this point, Sal calls out to Sonny, and gets up to move to him. \n", "test2_true": "SONNY Yeah... \nSAL I never been up in a plane before. \nSONNY It's nothing - it just goes up - it's the safest thing in the world. Safer than a car.  Don't worry about it, Sal - it'll be all right... they're great... \nAnd Sonny and Mulvaney exit toward rear of bank. \nINT. BANK - BACK DOOR AREA - LATE AFTERNOON (APPROX. 5 PM) \nSonny and Mulvaney move toward the back door and stop under a trap door in the ceiling.  Mulvaney looks up at it. \nMULVANEY It's gonna be up there. \nAs Sonny is staring up at the trap door, thinking about what to do, he hears a tiny scratching SOUND. \nSONNY What's that? \nSonny, tensing like an animal, peers around wildly to locate the source of the little scratching SOUND: like mice at a steel door. \nON SONNY \nwho quickly runs back toward the desk area. \nON GROUP - DESKS' AREA \nSonny races back in, grabs the gun from atop Mulvaney's desk, and with the cartridge in the other hand, runs back toward the back door again, jamming cartridge into rifle. \nAt this point, Sal runs in from the Conference room, covering everyone point-blank again, yelling for Edna to join the rest of the group. \nSONNY (whispering) They're trying to come through the door! \nSAL (to Edna) Everybody!  Back here! \nEdna quickly obeys, moving quickly to the rest of the group. \nON BACK DOOR AREA \nas Sonny races toward Mulvaney and back door with gun. \nANGLE ON MULVANEY \nSomebody or something is working on the other side of the door! \nNEW ANGLE ON SONNY \nas he moves back from the door, turns and levels the rifle on the back door... \nMULVANEY Sonny, if you shoot, shoot high... my car's parked out there. \nON SONNY \nstaring at the door.  He hears the continued scratching noise and might even see the door knob move. \nAbruptly he swings the rifle up so the bullet going through will clearly go over the head of any man, out through the transom. \nHe FIRES. \nANGLE ON INSIDE - SAL AND GROUP \nThey all scream, some of them falling to the floor, huddling together in terror. \nSONNY - AND GROUP \nSonny races back into main area where Sal covers group. \nSAL (to group) Get over here!  Get over here! \nEXT. BANK - REAR DOOR - LATE DAY \nA knot of half a dozen police are working at the door.  Two were trying to work tubes under it to pump in gas, others were trying a nylon line to the doorknob, the idea being that if Sonny came out that way, the moment he began to open the door the cops would yank it open, exposing him completely and gun him down.  The cops SCREAM as the SHOT comes through the door, showering them with brick fragments.  They scramble over cars, over each other, over fences, running into other cops, who also, not knowing what's happening, turn and flee, running into the crowd, which panics. \nVARIOUS ANGLES \non men, women, children, cops, detectives, dogs, cats, reporters, all in the area of the rear of the bank fleeing in waves over fences, cars, etc.  A flood of people like lemmings.  This is INTERCUT BY: \nINT. BANK \n1) MARGARET fainting. \n2) SAL herds group into vault area. \n3) SONNY dashing back and forth into rear bank area. \nANGLE ON BARBER SHOP \nMoretti, Sheldon, others come charging out, wondering what the hell, pulling guns out. \nBACK OF BANK \n", "test2_id": 3151, "test3_input": "MORETTI So whatsa deal? \nCOMMISSIONER They jet's comin' out.  But don't let 'em off the ground. \nMORETTI What if we gotta kill a whole lot of people? \nCOMMISSIONER Don't let 'em off the ground. \nMORETTI Listen. \nHe leans down to get close to his commissioner, because he's not fooled by the camaraderie into a false sense of security. \nTIGHTER TWO SHOT - MORETTI AND COMMISSIONER \nCOMMISSIONER (anticipating) If you're right I'm gonna back you a hundred percent, you know that. \nMORETTI (pleasantly) Fuck you, sir - if I'm right, I don't need you.  What I want is - if I make an honest mistake I want help. \nThe Commissioner nods - presses a button and the window goes up to keep the air conditioning in and the heat out. \nINT. BANK - LATE AFTERNOON - APPROX. 5 PM - MAIN BANK AREA \nas we hear Jenny on the phone with her husband.  Sonny is doing the manual of arms with his rifle. \nJENNY ...well, just pick him up and hold him.  No, he's not spoiled, he's just got to settle his stomach after eating.  He's used to me feeding me, that's all. \nAt one point, Sonny starts to show Miriam how to hold the gun and in mock seriousness, she tries to do the manual of arms. \nWE DRIFT TOWARD THE BACK CONFERENCE ROOM \nwhere Sal is seated at the Conference table, rifle on the table.  Edna and Sylvia are also seated there.  Maria enters. \nSYLVIA Somebody give me a cigarette. \nMaria walks over to her, offering her one, then remembers: \nMARIA Sylvia, you don't smoke. \nSYLVIA I never smoked before in my life but I got a right to start now if I want to. \nSAL You don't smoke... why do you want to start now. \nSYLVIA Because I'm scared, that's why. You never smoked? \nSAL I used to, but I stopped. \nSYLVIA You stopped?  Why? \nSAL Because I don't want cancer. \nSYLVIA You don't want cancer?  You're about to get your head blown off, you're worried about cancer. (to Maria) Gimme the cigarette. \nMaria starts to hand one to her. \nSAL No!  I'm not kidding.  Don't you understand?  You're pure! \nSYLVIA Pure? \nSAL You shouldn't start now. \nSYLVIA For God's sake!  As soon as I'm outta this bank robbery, I'm gonna stop... okay? \nSAL Go ahead.  Do what you want to do. I hate to see you break a perfect record.  You oughta take care of your body. \nSYLVIA My body?  What for? \nSAL Your body is the temple of the Lord. \nSYLVIA (staring at him) You're serious! \nSAL You're really pure, you know?  You got a perfect record.  You never used that stuff to ruin your body, why start now? \nSYLVIA You know, you remind me of my 19- year-old brother - only he's got his hair down to his knees - he looks like something that eats berries and roots out of the ground.  God forbid I should say something to him like, 'Listen, if you ever smoke marijuana, just remember that it's illegal' and he storms outta the house.  You rob a bank, but you keep your body pure, is that it? \nSAL You gonna smoke the cigarette? \nSYLVIA Yes... \nSal gets up and starts to leave the room... \nSYLVIA (calling to him) Sal... If I die of cancer it's going to be half your fault. \nSylvia grabs the cigarette from Maria. \nSAL (exiting) No - it's because you're weak. \nSonny continues with \"Manual of Arms\" business with rifle. Mulvaney is on the phone. \nMULVANEY (overlapping Janet into phone) Mulvaney... (listens) \nJANET (into phone) I don't know. \n", "test3_true": "Sonny takes the phone... \nSONNY Yeah? \nMORETTI We're bringing in your wife... \nON SONNY \nHe comes alert, looks around at Sal, nods, and starts for the door of the bank, turns to Sal. \nSONNY (gives him gun) They've got my wife.  They're bringing her in. \nHe exits bank.  Sal walks toward the door, stops behind the first post. \nEXT. FRONT OF APARTMENT HOUSE - DAY \nThe fire escape with the old lady and her jigsaw puzzle, the flak vested snipers, etc.  Below in the street a police car plows through the crowd with red lights flashing but no sirens -- or perhaps just a low growl to help move the human sea aside. People are leaning over trying to see inside. \nBARBER SHOP \nMoretti and Sheldon and staff move out into the street.  The cop car is moving through police lines, cops lifting barricades aside to let it pass. \nMOVING SHOT \nwith Moretti and others as they move to intercept the police car where it will stop on the corner.  As they stop, we can see Sonny step into the door of the bank, in the distance. \nHe is greeted with CHEERS from the crowd.  But is intent on the car. \nWe are NOW SHOOTING ACROSS THE CAR, OVER MORETTI'S BACK TOWARD THE BANK and Sonny. \nThe DRIVER of the police car gets out, with a huge grin on his face and nods to Moretti.  The back door opens and another cop gets out, also grinning.  They look around toward Sonny, as his wife gets out of the police car, on this side.  She is spectacularly good looking in a lithe cruel sort of way, like Lauren Bacall, but right now she is a mess. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BANK \nas Sonny sees Leon get out of the car. \nSONNY Leon!  Leon!  Over here!  Happy Birthday, Leon! \nON LEON \nwho doesn't hear Sonny calling, the detectives and Moretti start to take him to the barbershop. \nMORETTI (to cop driver) What's that? \nCOP DRIVER We went to the hospital, where he told us - and asked for his wife. He... (indicates Leon) ...says they got married in a church. \nMORETTI Jesus! \nThey continue along the sidewalk.  Leon, coming to, starts to look around him.  He sees Sonny. \nON SONNY \nas he yells again to Leon. \nSONNY Leon!  Happy Birthday! \nON LEON \nwho faints. \nFULL SHOT \nThe crowd yelling in increasing waves of SOUND; Moretti and cops pick up Leon and rush him toward the barbershop. \nANGLE ON SONNY \nwho dashes toward the bank door, enters. \nINT. BANK - DAY \nas Sonny comes running in.  Sylvia is now showing off her new-found expertise with a cigarette to Miriam, Jenny and Deborah, seated around Edna's desk.  (Deborah is talking on the phone.)  Meanwhile, Edna is back in the Conference Room with Mulvaney; Margaret is seated at her desk, speaking on the phone; Maria, speaking on phone, is seated at Mulvaney's desk - where television is still on. \nSonny, wanting to use a phone, realizes that all are in use, rushes to a desk at the front of the bank.  Sal follows him there.  Sonny grabs a phone. \nSONNY (into phone) Get me Moretti! \nINT. BARBERSHOP \nwhere Moretti and cops are trying to revive Leon.  A cop at the phone turns to Moretti. \nCOP ON PHONE Moretti - he wants to talk to you. \nMoretti walks over to phone, takes receiver from cop. \nINT. BANK \nSonny waiting for Moretti to answer phone. \n", "test3_id": 3152}

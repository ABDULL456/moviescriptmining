{"test1_input": "who starts to move toward the front door, looking over at Sonny trying to put out the fire. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS MULVANEY TO THE FRONT DOOR; Sonny moves with him, covering him all the time. \nANGLE ON FRONT DOOR \nas Sonny stands behind closed venetian blinds to listen to the conversation and to cover Mulvaney. \nSONNY The gun's right on your back... \nMULVANEY Give me the keys... \nSonny hands him the keys. \nVERY CLOSE SHOT - SAL \nHe raises the gun and sights it now, and in this moment, we should sense a kind of luxurious relaxation into anticipation on Sal's part.  He is smiling a little, and for the first time, looks happy, and that's what makes him seem dangerous. He's looking forward to an excuse to kill.  It's here now: survival.  There is something almost sexual about the way he settles his body down behind the weapon, getting ready for the squeeze on the trigger, the report, the violent shove of recoil against his muscles and sinews. \nIn the background, we see Sylvia bringing Howard a cup of water. \nANGLE ON DOOR \nemphasizing the small of Mulvaney's back.  The man is somebody he knows from across the street.  He looks worried and mystified... \nMULVANEY (unlocking door) What is it, Sam? \nSAM Everything's all right?  You okay? \nMULVANEY Yeah, just a cigarette got in a wastebasket. \nSilence.  Sam stares around... thinking. \nSAM You all right? \nMULVANEY Little smoke: like a Polish four- alarm fire, is all. \nSAM Yeah.  Well, you're okay? \nMULVANEY Yeah, thanks for keeping an eye out. \nSAM Okay. \nHe's not satisfied, but he can't see anything and he can't think of anything more to say, so... \nMULVANEY Thanks again, Sam. \nSAM I'm glad it's okay. \nMULVANEY It's okay. [Regards to the family, Sam.] \nMulvaney locks the door and walks inside the bank, giving the keys back to Sonny. \nMULVANEY For God's sake, will you please go now?  We gave you every nickel we got. \nSONNY You're goin' outside with me.  If there's no cops around, we just split. Otherwise, you go with us. \nMulvaney and Sonny starts to walk back toward Sal.  As they do, the PHONE BEGINS TO RING AGAIN (#3). \nSONNY (to Mulvaney) Answer it. \nMulvaney shrugs helplessly.  Picks up the phone, standing at desk opposite his. \nON SAL \nSAL He's gone? \nSONNY Yeah - it's all right... let's go. \nMULVANEY ON PHONE \nMULVANEY Hello, Mulvaney here... \nTWO SHOT - SONNY & SAL \nSONNY Sal, get 'em in the vault. \nSAL Where's the money? \nSONNY Get 'em in the vault! \nAs Sal starts to herd them into the vault (Sylvia helping Howard, still with the cup of water), Mulvaney is still on the phone.  Sonny moves down to get the money bag atop the teller's cages and we hear Mulvaney on phone. \nMULVANEY (tired) What property is that, Mrs. Anterio? The Third Avenue property - you already got a second mortgage on. We discussed it before... \nANGLE AT VAULT \nThe girls are afraid; Miriam unlocks the gate as Sonny uses Mulvaney's keys to the matching lock. \nJENNY (from inside vault area) You won't close the vault?  How can we breathe? \nSONNY No, that's okay... just close the gate... \n", "test1_true": "SYLVIA Listen, I'll never make it.  I'll have to go to the toilet. \nSONNY What's the matter... they never housebroke you? \nSYLVIA It's not a joke.  I got this terrible fear of being locked in... \nSAL Goddamn women... \nSONNY Ah shit.  Okay... go ahead.  Anybody else have to go? \nEDNA Me, too, please. \nSAL You see... now they all gotta go. \nAs Sylvia starts to move out, Sonny starts to cross ahead of her. \nSONNY Wait a minute - I want to check. \nMulvaney finishes his phone conversation.  He moves toward the group at the vault. \nNEW ANGLE \nas Sonny sprints for the door to the Ladies' Room. \nINSIDE LADIES' ROOM \nIt is a little lounge; sitting on a couch under the window, making up her face (or painting her toenails) and listening to her tiny transistor radio, oblivious to all that's happened, is MARIA, heavily-painted and voluptuous Latin girl.  Sylvia, following him in, is shocked.  She's forgotten about Maria.  Now she runs over to her, puts her arms around her. \nSYLVIA Oh - Maria! \nSONNY Who the hell is that?  God damn it! What the... \nMaria is about to protest, but Sylvia grabs her and starts to hustle her out. \nSONNY What are you trying to pull? \nSYLVIA I forgot she's in here. \nSONNY Come on, nobody's going to the bathroom - come on... \nHe moves with them back to the vault area, herds them into it.  At this point, PHONE RINGS AGAIN (#4).  Sonny moves to get the empty wastebasket, shoving it into the vault for the girls to use in case of emergency.  Mulvaney moves to his desk and phone. \nMulvaney has by this time answered the phone, and is now holding it out to Sonny.  HOLD THE BEAT... \nMULVANEY (to Sonny) It's for you. \nON SONNY AND SAL \nThey both stare at Mulvaney.  Sonny slowly moves toward Mulvaney.  For the first time since he entered the bank, he's quiet and slow.  He takes the instrument and slowly puts it to his ear.  The group from the vault now slowly starts to move out to listen to the conversation. \nSONNY (into phone) Yeah. \nMORETTI (V.O.) What are you doin' in there? \nSONNY Who's this? \nMORETTI (V.O.) This is Detective Sergeant Moretti, asshole, we got you completely by the balls.  You don't believe me, I'm lookin' you right in the eye. Right now, I can see you... \nSAL Who is it? \nSonny turns and looks out through the door.  Sure enough, in the window of the barbershop across the street, the dim figure of a man on a telephone can be SEEN looking out toward us. He wears a hat in spite of the weather and a cigar is clamped in his mouth.  He is an old-time, hard-nosed, uneducated, street-wise, sarcastic New York cop, outspoken, rude and sentimental.  Right now he's a distant silhouette and a voice on the telephone. \nCLOSE ON SONNY \nholding the phone.  Listening to the voice of his death speaking in New York accents. \nMORETTI (V.O.) Okay?  Let's be reasonable and not stupid and not get anybody hurt. You come to the front door with hands folded on your head, unnastand? Nobody's gonna shoot or... \nSonny slowly, almost sadly, puts the telephone receiver back down, cutting off the little voice at the other end.  He looks up at Mulvaney, then to Sal. \nSONNY (to Sal) It's the cops.  Shit! \nSAL How'd that happen? \nMULVANEY (backing away from Sonny) I swear to God... on my salary, I'm not gonna be any hero... \nSONNY I took too long. \nSAL It was the fire, asshole! \nSonny paces. \nMULVANEY I told you, just go, get out when you could, but no, you just got to hang around. \nSonny is pacing back and forth, trying to figure out what to do. \nSONNY Oh, shit!  I gotta have time to think. \nSYLVIA What is it?  Did you just barge in here... He doesn't have plan.  It's all a whim. (sarcastic) 'Rob a bank!  What not?' \n", "test1_id": 3150, "test2_input": "MULVANEY I don't care who you are... (shove) I just want to get you outta here, safe, right? \nSONNY What if I take you with me? \nMULVANEY (stopping to rest for a beat, thinking) If you take anybody, please take me. \nSONNY They'll shoot you; the fucking cops'll shoot you... they don't give a damn. In spite of that bank insurance. You see what they did in Attica, they shot everybody, the hostages, prisoners, cops, guards, forty-two people they killed, the innocent with the guilty. \nThey have the machine almost to the door now, with Mulvaney almost pinned between the machine and the door.  He eases himself out.  Looks at the gun, then at Sonny, then they shove the machine against the door.  Sonny then gives Mulvaney his jacket to put on again. \nSONNY Anyway, I'm not gonna take you. I'm gonna take one of the girls, a married one with a couple of kids. The cops don't like it in the papers when they kill a mother, especially if she's got young kids. \nFinished with the task, Sonny takes his gun and with Mulvaney, they start to cross back toward Sal and the rest of the group. \nSONNY You're just a nice guy, Mr. Mulvaney. Only don't fuck around with me, you know what I mean? \nMULVANEY I don't fool around with you. \nMulvaney crosses back to his desk and sits down.  At this point, all the phones are off the hooks. \nEXT. (AERIAL) ANGLE FROM INT. POLICE HELICOPTER (OVER BANK) \nAs it banks steeply we can see past Pilot to bank, and cops around car.  We see a small crowd being held back by a few police still setting up barricades.  It is the first indication of the crowd event it became.  It also sets the geography for us, but very quickly another copter swims into view and the two circle each other.  The other copter -- only feet away -- is a TV news helicopter, with a big camera sticking out the open door on our side. \nIt is turned down by the Cameraman to focus on the bank.  A COP in the police helicopter yells through his bullhorn at the TV Cameraman. \nBULLHORN COP This is a restricted area.  You are flying in a restricted area... \nThe TV Cameraman swivels his camera up to focus on the Cop, and as the lens hits us dead center... \nINT. APARTMENT NEAR BANK \nThough an open window a fire escape can be seen and beyond it an angle of street and the bank.  Near the window in a corner is a TV set, and on the TV set we are seeing the shot of the police helicopter and the Cop yelling on the bullhorn as seen from the TV copter.  A couple of Elderly Men are sitting watching the TV set, ignoring the bank, which they can see in the flesh, as it were.  Outside we are HEARING the copters, and on the TV set likewise, and the voice of the Announcer. \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...police as yet have made no contact with the bank robbers who are locked in the bank... \nThere is a HAMMERING at the door, and the men at the TV set barely have time to look around before several burly Cops wearing flak vests and helmets and carrying sniper rifles with telescopic slights move through the room, ignoring the men.  They move out onto the fire escape, a couple going up higher, settling themselves down to aim in their rifles on the front of the bank.  A lot of AD LIB dialogue, but what we note is the Cops, as a man, take a look at themselves on the TV. \nEXT. BANK - DAY \nThe FRAME is full of cop faces... tough, mesomorphic faces with a layer of fat under the skin, increasing as age.  They have the look of cops: alert, curious, weighing.  They are city cops; they don't have that old-fashioned condemnatory expression, there is an element of playfulness in their nature -- the fact is they love their work, which is criminals.  There is a peculiar delight in ferreting out the criminal impulse in everybody, and a matching fury in punishing it -- which is the action of repressing their own strongly developed criminal unconscious.  These are tense, funny, violent, and rigidly controlled men. \nMORETTI is an old-line cop, a lot more relaxed than the younger men and the cold professionals of the FBI, who as a group resemble astronauts, and like them hide (but do not deny) the psychic chaos underneath. \nRight now they are looking at the sky.  We HEAR a heavy helicopter track. \nWe feature SHELDON, the silver-haired FBI Agent-in-Charge, who looks like an accountant, and Moretti, with hat and cigar, and a face out of Warner Brothers movies of the Forties.  In spite of Sheldon's age, Moretti plays though he's a smart kid who still needs a little help. \nSheldon is getting out of a gray car, wears a gray suit. Three men with him are carbon copies of him at younger ages. \nThe three hang around him.  They approach Moretti who looks at them without moving. \nMORETTI (to no one) Here comes the FBI. (to Sheldon) You men lookin' for protection?  We got all the police right here. \nSHELDON Why didn't you just wait and try to take 'em out there in the street? \nMoretti looks at him, cheerfully sarcastic. \nMORETTI I made an error in judgment.  I thought the sons of bitches would be overwhelmed with remorse at the sight of a police officer.  And you know somethin'?  Nobody has said hostage yet.  Unnastan? \nThey are moving past Cops on the corner heading toward a small barbershop across the street from the bank.  We now sense the growing crowd, standing quietly, just staring not yet knowing what's going on. \nNEW ANGLE \nFrom down the street come a group of odd-looking men in suits, carrying all kinds of electric junk: The NEW REPORTERS. They run heavily, sweating martinis and cigarette smoke... they run up to Moretti and Sheldon, who walk along, trying not to catch an eye. \nMOVING SHOT - MORETTI AND SHELDON AMONG NEWSMEN. \nVOICES How many in the bank? Have they got hostages?  Any shots exchanged? (Etc., AD LIB) \nMORETTI No, we don't know that yet.  This young fella without the hat is FBI. I'm Detective Sergeant Eugene Moretti ... M-O-R-E-double-T-I.  Eugene.  I don't give a shit, but my wife cries if you spell it wrong. \nThey have arrived at the barber shop where Moretti fights his way inside. \nINT. BARBER SHOP - DAY \nA COP is talking on the wall phone as MORETTI, BAKER, etc. are trying to get inside. \nCOP ...no, just get hold of Al, tell him to get the catering truck over to 26th and Avenue B, there's a bank robbery in progress and big crowd. Big!  Tell him to bring ice cream -- I got to hang up. \nHe hangs up and immediately begins thumbing through a POCKET PHONE BOOK.  Throughout this Cop is engaged in personal business on the fringe of this affair, and though he's on duty he hardly knows what's happening on the robbery.  He's trying to get his brother-in-law with the ice cream truck down here, etc. \nMoretti has got the crowd cleared back, so that now we SEE why this has been chosen as a tactical command post.  From here, while talking on the phone, Moretti can see the bank, and through the uncurtained door he can even see some distance inside. \nMoretti picks up the phone. \nMORETTI (to phone cop) You get the phone company? \nPHONE COP It's being set up... this phone'll be a direct line into the bank. \nMoretti is already dialing.  The phone is answered. \n", "test2_true": "(Re Moretti's 3rd conversation on phone with Sonny.) \nThe group inside the bank have now been waiting approximately twelve minutes since anything last happened.  Sonny is seated at Mulvaney's desk, all the phones off the hooks. \nThe rest of the group is huddled around the vault area where Sal is keeping his eye on them. \nSuddenly, Sonny jumps up and puts all the receivers back on the hooks, crossing back to sit at Mulvaney's desk again. \nPHONE STARTS TO RING and Sonny picks it up. \nMORETTI Okay, you're in there and we're out here.  What do we do now? \nSONNY I told you -- keep away.  I don't know what we do now. \nMORETTI Awright, but I wanna talk to you. First off, we wanna know if the people in the bank are okay. \nSONNY They're okay. \nMORETTI You alone, or you got confederates? \nSONNY I'm not alone. \nMORETTI How many you got in there? \nSONNY I got Sal. \nMORETTI Sal?  What's that for?  Salvatore? \nSONNY Sal.  He's the killer.  We're Vietnam veterans so killing don't mean anything to us, you understand? \nA cop passing by presses a portable two-way radio into Moretti's hand: He accepts it and holds as though he expected it.  The Cop passes the same type of set to certain other officers.  These sets are tuned in to each other, and throughout the movie, there is a constant background talk on these sets.  This is police procedure; the orders are for everyone to talk about everything.  If anyone has a question, has heard a rumor or a sound, whatever, it is immediately responded to, so that there can be the fewest possible surprises.  Sample dialogue might go: \"Did I hear a shot?\" \"Over here, by the bank, there was a report like a gunshot, inside.\"  \"Roger, we heard that from the barbershop... it was inside the bank.\"  \"Barbershop, you can see inside?\" \"Roger, we heard from the barbershop... it was inside the bank.\"  \"Barbershop, you can see inside?\"  \"Roger, this is the barbershop, we see inside, the perpetrator is moving toward the rear of the bank.\"  \"Who's that guy walking through the barricade?\"  \"The blue suit?\"  \"Yeah.\"  \"Off-duty Inspector come down to see can you use him.\"  Etc.  They really do use the word Perpetrator, Felon, etc.  The Cop handing out radios makes Moretti sign for it -- which Moretti does during the following: \nMORETTI Right -- got ya.  Okay, so there's you -- what's your name? \nSONNY What do you want to know that for? \nMORETTI Give me a name, any name, just so I got somethin' to call you. \nSONNY Call me Sonny-boy. \nMORETTI Sonny-boy, one word? \nSONNY One word.  You won't find it in the phone book. \nMORETTI Listen, Sonny... can I call you Sonny for short? \nSONNY Call me whatever you want. \nMORETTI Okay, Sonny, I want to see if the people in the bank are okay, then what I want to do is work out a way to get them out of there.  I want to come over there, without a gun... and you can frisk me.  So you can see you can trust me.  So we can talk and find a way outta this mess. \nSONNY I frisk you? \nMORETTI You frisk me. \nSONNY Right -- I'm with you, buddy. \nMORETTI I'd like just some sign I can trust you too, Sonny.  I don't want to trust my body out where you could just shoot me.  Some sight... right? \nSONNY Sure... like... I'm not gonna shoot you. \nMORETTI How about letting the people out of the bank.  Why put them in this position? \nSONNY They're what's keeping me alive. You think you're dealing with an idiot?  Talk to me then. \nMORETTI Okay, give us the women. \nSONNY Oh, no... Women is all we got. \nMORETTI You're all one way!  I'm bein' reasonable with you; give me somethin'... Give me one of them, anyway... Just one... \nSONNY So -- you want me to send one out there... Okay.  I'll see what I can do. \nSonny hangs up and moves over to Sal.  The rest of the group has been trying to make out what's being said at the other end of the conversation. \nSONNY (to Sal) He wants one. \nSAL Dead or alive? \nSONNY Alive. \nNow Sonny looks at the group. \nSONNY Okay... who's gonna go first? \nMulvaney now stands up at his desk, looks over at the group near the vault.  They look back at him, waiting for some instructions. \nMULVANEY It's up to you ladies. \nSYLVIA Howard! \n", "test2_id": 3151, "test3_input": "SHELDON (showing ID) No more favors.  That's all over, Sonny. \nSONNY (sarcastically) Aw, Jesus... you been doin' us favors all night! \nSHELDON I've got a jet.  I'll have airport limousine here in a half hour.  I want the hostages. \nSONNY Bullshit! \nSHELDON I'd like to work with you on this, not against you. \nSonny comes around, looking for Moretti: can't see him. \nSONNY Well, Jesus, these hostages are keeping me alive. \nSHELDON Okay, when do I get them? \nSONNY At the airport.  We get on the plane, check it out, and if it's all okay we'll send them out.  Except one. \nSHELDON I want them all. \nSONNY I want to talk to Leon. \nPause, while Sheldon thinks this over. \nSHELDON I want to come in, and see if everybody's okay. \nSONNY You got guts.  You think if Sal and me have cut their throats we're gonna let you out? \nSHELDON I have to see. \nSonny re-enters bank. \nINT. BANK - NIGHT \nSonny goes over to Sal. \nSONNY It's the FBI.  He wants to come in. \nSAL Have him walk in backwards. \nSonny exits bank. \nEXT. BANK - NIGHT \nSonny crosses to Sheldon, grins, grabs him and executes a very professional-looking pat-down search. \nHe removes Sheldon's .38 from a shoulder holster, producing it for the crowd with a flourish like a magician: some of the old playfulness returns for a moment.  He carefully and with showbiz flourishes searches Sheldon's thighs and groin. The crowd HOWLS.  Sheldon bears it with stoic calm. \nCLOSE TWO SHOT \nas Sonny stands up from the search and finds Sheldon's eyes locked to his with flat calm. \nSONNY Jesus, you'd like to kill me, too. \nSHELDON I wouldn't like to, but I will, if I have to. \nSONNY Nothin' personal, huh?  The man that kills me, I want him to do it because he hates my guts.  Not because it's a job.  Okay, let's go... but you gotta walk in backwards. \nThe move toward the door of the bank, where Sonny opens the door, preceding Sheldon, both men entering backwards. \nINT. BANK - NIGHT \nExcept for the 4 emergency lights, it is very dark - and very hot as Sonny and Sheldon enter the bank.  Sal now stands behind the desks, covering Sheldon and the group assembled at the vault.  Sheldon takes in every detail as he walks toward the group in the rear, followed closely and covered by Sonny.  As they near the desks, Sonny yells out an order for the group: \nSONNY Nobody give their right name... it's the FBI! \nSHELDON I just want to see all you young ladies are all all right in here. \nTWO SHOT - SYLVIA AND SAL \nShe's pissed. \nSYLVIA Listen, we asked for the jet hours ago, what are you doin' out there? \nSheldon is watching Sal, trying to gauge him.  This is the first time anyone from outside has seen Sal. \nSHELDON (his eyes on Sal) It's all being set up, we'll have you out of here in a couple of hours. \nSYLVIA (to Sheldon) Just give them what they want. \nSheldon now walks closer to group, looking into the two small examining rooms as he moves.  Sonny covers him every inch of the way. \nSHELDON They're getting what they want.  We just want to be sure we get what we want, which is to get all you ladies out safe.  And you two boys, too. \nSheldon is now standing very close to Sal. \nSAL (to Sheldon) You got to talk to the TV, tell them to stop talking about the two homosexuals.  I'm not gay...  that's the truth.  Tell 'em that. \nSHELDON I will. (he turns to Sonny) Sonny?  Outside for a minute? \nSONNY Sal? \n", "test3_true": "EXT. BANK - NIGHT \nas they (Sheldon and Sonny) exit and stand in the doorway out of earshot of the others.  Sheldon is matter-of-fact, but insinuating and conspiratorial. \nSHELDON Sonny, you handled yourself real well.  A lot of men would have choked, and we'd have a lot of chaos and panic and maybe a death or a multiple death on our hands, but you handled it.  I respect that.  Don't you try to take Sal.  We'll handle him.  You just sit tight and you won't get hurt. \nHe starts to go.  Sonny grabs him. \nSONNY Wait a minute!  What the fuck you tryin' to tell me? \nSHELDON (quiet) What I said.  You just sit quiet and we'll handle Sal. \nAnd he turns and starts to walk away, leaving Sonny staring after him. \nINT. BARBER SHOP - NIGHT \nas Sheldon steps into the door.  The place is jammed, Moretti stands inside the door where Sonny could not have possibly seen him.  Sheldon quietly turns and stands beside him, both men looking back across the street. \nMORETTI The little bastard miss me? \nSheldon smiles the supercilious Ehrlichman smile of his. \nINT. BANK - NIGHT \nas Sonny re-enters.  He's restless, hyperactive, constantly moving during this scene; a man with a potentially guilty conscience.  Sal moves toward him and both men walk to area in front of the Tellers' cages. \nSAL What'd he say? \nSONNY He was talkin' about arrangements... we were talkin' about the TV. \nSAL Why couldn't he talk about that here? \nSONNY He was showin' me how the airport bus is comin' in, like that, Sal. (notices Mulvaney start to faint) What's wrong with him? \nIn the rear, Mulvaney slumps into a chair beside Margaret's desk.  Sylvia rushes to help him, untying his tie, etc. Maria runs into the Conference room, hoping to find remains of sugar as Deborah crosses to his desk, looking through the drawers for medication.  Jenny simply can't cope with it and walks away. \nSONNY Hey, you okay? \nSYLVIA He's got diabetes.  He's not a well person. \nSONNY Those bastards -- they poisoned the pizza!  Sal - you didn't eat any pizza!? \nMULVANEY I didn't eat any pizza. \nSYLVIA I told you, he's got diabetes. \nSONNY You're supposed to balance your sugar diet, right? \nSonny starts to move toward the front door. \nEXT. BANK - NIGHT \nSonny rushes outside. \nSONNY Hey!  Is there a doctor over there? Get him over here!  Come on, on the double! \nSheldon and a young DOCTOR appear, concerned... \nSHELDON What's wrong? \nSONNY The manager, he's diabetic, he's lookin' bad. \nSheldon turns, calls out. \nSHELDON Doctor... \nA man comes forward - is frisked by Sonny, who then dumps contents of his Black Bag and looks for weapons.  Sonny then dashes inside bank. \nINT. BANK - NIGHT \nas Sonny comes in, walks over to Sal. \nSONNY Sal - the Doctor's coming in. \nSonny then rushes back outside bank again. \nEXT.

{"test1_input": "EXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE THAT NIGHT \nAdele steps out of the trailer. \nADELE Early? \nShe walks carefully around the junk piles. It's dark; hard to see. She comes to the edge of a deep dark hole and peers in... She can't see anything but hears the rustling of a shovel digging. \nADELE Early? You down there? \nThe sound of digging stops. \nEARLY (from inside the hole) What's up Adele? Dinner ready? \nADELE Almost. \nAfter a moment's hesitation, Early resumes his digging. \nADELE Early... \nThe digging stops again. \nADELE Tell me more about California. \nThe moonlight illuminates his face when he looks up at her. \nEARLY Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact. \nADELE I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here. \nEARLY Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn... (beat) ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month... \nADELE What'll we do out there? \nEARLY Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon... \nEarly lets out a playful howl, as Adele looks up over her shoulder at the moon. \nADELE You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind. \nEARLY Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it. \nAdele smiles and begins walking back to the trailer. \nADELE Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready. \nEARLY I heard that. \nAfter a moment, Early climbs out of the hole and stands in the moonlight for a moment. We see that he's completely naked except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots. Early gazes up into the night sky, looking at the cold white moon. \nEXT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT - DAWN \nBrian exits loft carrying two bags. Carrie is also carrying a bag, and smoking a cigarette, as they walk to the car. \nCARRIE What did he sound like on the phone? \nOMITTED \nBRIAN Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.' \nBrian throws the bags in the open trunk with the other bags. \nBRIAN (grins) I like that. \nCARRIE I still think we should have met them first. \nBRIAN Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember? \nCarrie bows her head and folds her hands in mock prayer. \nCARRIE Please God, we're gonna be stuck with these people for a week, don't let them be as boring as Brian's friends. Anything... but that. \nBrian throws a needling glance to Carrie and slams the car hood shut. They both get into the car, Brian behind the wheel. \nINT. LINCOLN \nBRIAN Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta \"Deliverance.\" (quotes from the movie) \"Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!\" \nCARRIE Funny, very funny. \nBrian starts the car. It backfires loudly startling Carrie. Brian laughs. \nBRIAN (quoting again) \"Aintry? This river don't go to Aintry.\" \nEXT. LINCOLN ON STREET \nThe engine revs again and the Lincoln pulls away down the street. \nEXT. BUS STATION - DAWN \nPAN UP from Adele's new red high-heeled shoes. We hear Adele speaking with an unfamiliar tone of authority to her voice. \nADELE We shouldn't be doin' this, Early. You leavin' the state, ridin' around with strangers... besides, what kinda people would want to stop at places where other people was murdered. \nThe camera slowly reveals Adele... and the fact that she is alone as she voices her concerns. Then from behind her Early approaches. Just in time to hear... \n", "test1_true": "EARLY They ain't dangerous Adele. They're writers. \nStartled, Adele drops her shoulder bag. It lands on top of a couple of cardboard boxes and a beat up old duffle bag -- all their possessions. A few personal items spill out of it. \nADELE Early Grayce! \nShe kneels down to pick things up. \nADELE (changes subject) Did you settle things with Mr. Diebold? \nEARLY Yeah I left him with the car... We're all squared up now. \nEARLY'S POV \nAs Adele picks up her spilled personal possessions, Early notices her prized cactus in the bag. \nEARLY What's this? \nHe angrily reaches in and grabs it. \nADELE Early! \nShe reaches for the cactus but misses. \nEARLY What kind of a person would carry a cactus in her purse! \nAdele bites her lip almost crying. Suddenly, Early looks past Adele to see something, Adele turns too. \nNEW ANGLE \nThe Lincoln comes gliding into view. \nINT. LINCOLN - PULLS INTO BUS STATION - DAWN \nThrough the windshield we see Early... Adele by his side. \nCARRIE You've got to be kidding me, they look like Okies! \nBrian honks the horn, Early waves back. \nCARRIE Jesus... They've probably got five bucks between them. Turn around. \nBRIAN Lighten up... \nON EARLY AND ADELE \nADELE Geez, they look kinda weird. \nEARLY You just smile, let me do all the talking. \nADELE How many times you gonna tell me that? \nEARLY (smiling at Brian) As many times as it takes. \nEXT. BUS STATION \nBrian stops the Lincoln and gets out. He approaches Early and shakes his hand, then Adele's. \nBRIAN Hi I'm Brian... Early, and you must be Adele. \nAn awkward moment as everyone just stands there... until Brian reaches for Adele's bag. \nBRIAN Let me help you. \nBrian picks up her bag and carries it to the Lincoln. Adele is instantly won over by the gesture -- Early leery of it. \nINT. LINCOLN \nCarrie watches as Brian and Early carry their things to the trunk. Carrie leans forward and sets the trip odometer to zero. When she sits back up, Adele is standing at her window. \nADELE Hi, I'm Adele. \nCARRIE (reserved) Carrie. \nShe turns away from the window... \nADELE (shyly) I like your hair. \nCarrie turns back, rolls down window... \nCARRIE ...Pardon? \nADELE ...I said, I like your hair. \nCARRIE ...Thank you. \nShe turns and sees Early reflected in the side mirror watching her. He grins at her, Carrie looks away. \nNEW ANGLE: FROM INSIDE THE TRUNK OF THE LINCOLN \nBrian crams the last of the bags in, as Early watches. \nBRIAN Tight fit. \nEARLY Best kind. \n", "test1_id": 2640, "test2_input": "Brian presses a button on the audio cassette player. The small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman being tortured and pleading for her life. \nFLASH!! FLASH!! \nCarrie fires off a series of shots from different angles. Brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened. Screams from the audio tape bounce off the walls. \nBRIAN (speaks into his small hand held tape recorder) His mother had him working in here before he was eight years old... killing animals with a sledgehammer that was bigger than he was. \nBrian and Carrie walk through the remains of a doorway into another room. \nBRIAN When she was pissed at him, she'd beat the shit out of him and lock him in here overnight... \nThe pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a steady whimpering. \nBRIAN (continuing) ...Eventually the boy wakes up one morning, picks up that sledgehammer and starts hurting back. \nFLASH!! FLASH!! \nCarrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior. Then she stops, turns and walks out of the room. She's had enough. Brian follows after her. \nBRIAN There's more... \nCARRIE I'm finished. \nCarrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear. \nBRIAN Look... I know you're pissed off about the gun, and I don't blame you... \nCarrie wheels around to face him. \nCARRIE Brian, I'm not pissed off. God damm it, turn that thing off. \nShe switches off the cassette player. \nCARRIE I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you? \nBRIAN Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? (pause) But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos. \nCARRIE I can't believe I agreed to do this. \nOMITTED \nBRIAN Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too. \nCARRIE Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference. \nCarrie storms out of the place. She exits the tunnel, and makes her way toward... \nTHE LINCOLN \nAs she approaches it, through the rear windshield she sees... Early and Adele fucking wildly! \nCarrie wants to turn away, but she can't stop watching them. Fascinated, she raises the camera to her eye and zooms in on them. \nTHROUGH CARRIE'S CAMERA LENS: ON EARLY AND ADELE \nEarly is sitting against the back seat. Adele is straddling him. Carrie's finger finds the shutter button. \nEarly's arms move up under Adele's dress... Her hands press up against the roof. She's trembling... Wavering... Carrie's finger presses down on the button, CLICK!! \nThen in one swift movement Early sweeps Adele onto the back seat. Close on Early's face. He's sweating... Lips moving... Talking dirty to Adele. \nKeeping her finger on the button, Carrie rapid fires through a whole roll of film. She's oblivious to the whine of the motor drive once all the film is shot out. \nThen unexpectedly!! Early looks directly into the camera, at Carrie. And smiles... And continues to fuck Adele. \nA chill rushes through Carrie, she almost drops the camera. She runs back toward the tunnel... and right into Brian's arms. He startles her. She pulls away from him. \nCARRIE Brian I want him out of our car! \nBRIAN Why, what did he do? \nCARRIE Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do! \nOMITTED \nEXT. DESERT - DUSK \nThe Lincoln passes through frame. In the background, the surreal image of an industrial complex bathed in an eerie artificial light. \nINT. LINCOLN PULLS INTO A GAS STATION - TWILIGHT \nAn electrical storm is in full swing. \nEXT. GAS STATION \nThe Lincoln barely comes to a stop at the pumps before Carrie storms out of the car and heads toward the gas station interior. She leaves Brian to break the news to Adele and Early. \nINT. GAS STATION \nThe only person inside is a YOUNG MALE ATTENDANT. He's watching TV behind the counter as Carrie enters. On the TV we see a NEWSMAN. We only catch fragments of what he is saying because the storm outside is affecting the TV reception. \nCARRIE Twenty dollars in the tank and a carton of cigarettes. \nIn fact, each time the lightning flashes occur all of the electrical power at the station is affected. The fluorescent lights outside and inside begin to flicker and falter sporadically. \n", "test2_true": "Static. \nCarrie looks at the TV, watches for a moment. It doesn't hold her attention. She looks away and notices Adele leaving the car. Adele walks toward a Coke machine at the other end of the gas station. \nATTENDANT Here's your cigarettes... \nCarrie turns back toward him. \nATTENDANT ...And change. Better be careful, looks like a bad one coming. Where you headin'? \nCARRIE California. \nATTENDANT Hear it never rains there. Must be nice. \nHe buttons up his rain coat and goes out into the night to gas up the Lincoln. Carrie pulls a pack of cigarettes from the carton, nervously lights one up. She looks out the window toward the Lincoln. \nEXT. GAS PUMPS \nThrough flashes of lightning and thunder she sees Brian in the car talking to Early. Early listening quietly. Brian looking adamant yet apologetic. The attendant fills the Lincoln's tank. \nINT. GAS STATION \nSimultaneously, as Carrie watches this... Behind her on the TV screen... A wave of interference scrambles the picture. \nNEWSCASTER ...we would like to repeat... \nStatic. \nNEWSCASTER ...there is a nationwide manhunt for... \nStatic. \nINT. GAS STATION - ON THE TV \nThe static clears and the Newscaster appears. \nNEWSCASTER (O.S.) ...is believed responsible for the murders of his landlord John Diebold... \nStatic. \nEXT. GAS PUMPS - TIGHTER ON LINCOLN \nBrian's still talking -- using his hands to explain. Early is watching him with a resigned expression. \nINT. GAS STATION - ON THE TV \nA video tape image of a familiar gas station recorded by a surveillance camera. \nNEWSCASTER ...of the fatal stabbing and robbery of Mr. Joseph Davies Robbins... \nNEW ANGLE ON CARRIE \nShe stares at the TV with growing horror as she notices a familiar black Lincoln in the background. In mid-ground, a male figure approaches the video camera unknowingly. Slowly, Early's image becomes visible. \nNEWSCASTER If you see this man... \nCarrie panics, turns toward the door and runs smack into the arms of a dripping wet Early Grayce! Early stares at her and drops his bag to the ground. \nEARLY I ain't ridin' in no bus... bitch. \nThen... Early notices himself on the TV. \nNEWSCASTER (O.S.) ...call your local police or FBI... \nStatic. \nEarly grabs Carrie around the neck and yanks her into the back office. He pushes her down onto a chair. \nEARLY You just sit there and keep your mouth shut. \nHe searches behind the cash register and finds a sawed-off shotgun. He shuts the TV off. \nEARLY I knew that boy'd have a hogleg here somewhere. \nThe Attendant rushes back in from the pouring rain. Early points the sawed-off shotgun at him. \nEARLY Get over here. \nEarly forces him into the office. \nEARLY Sit your ass down in that corner. \nAdele enters the adjacent room. She checks out the various vending machines in search of candy. Early taps on the window and motions her into the office. She sees Carrie in the chair, scared to death, and Early aiming the gun at the Attendant. \nADELE Early, what're you doin'? \nEARLY Go back to the car and keep Brian there. I don't want him in here... (beat) Do it Adele... Now! \nAdele looks back at Carrie, then hurries out. Early empties the cash register. \nEARLY What's your name, boy? \nATTENDANT (very scared) Walter Livesy. \nEARLY Think. I might just have to kill you Walter. How do you feel about that? \n", "test2_id": 2641, "test3_input": "INT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME (INTERCUT WITH PREVIOUS SCENE) \nBRIAN Carrie, watch for Early. \nCARRIE What are you going to do? \nBRIAN I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free. \nCarrie glues her eyes to the kitchen doorway. Brian presses his back up under the belly of the piano and using all his strength manages to lift the piano an inch off the floor. Carrie slides her cuffs out from under the leg. \nCARRIE What about you? \nBRIAN I don't know. \nCarrie's eyes dart back toward the kitchen. Then she notices a chair nearby. \nCARRIE Can you lift it again? Just lift it, hurry. \nCarrie grabs the chair. As Brian lifts the piano, she pushes the chair beneath the underside of it. It holds the piano suspended an inch off the floor. Brian drops to the floor and slips the cuffs free. \nWhen... a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden. \nA moment later, Early steps quietly into the room. He's pulling the last few cactus needles from his face. He sees Brian and Carrie standing. \nEARLY You two been busy in here. \nBRIAN What happened to Adele? \nEARLY Well, let's put it this way. (beat) I need me a new woman. \nA shocked silence. Brian and Carrie look to one another. Carrie moves toward the kitchen but Early stops her! Brian rushes at him. Early sticks the .45 automatic in his face! \nEARLY Sorry about this Bri... \nHe starts to squeeze the trigger. \nCARRIE (desperate) Early, don't. \nEarly stops. He looks to Carrie. \nCARRIE I'll do whatever you want. You want me to go with you, I'll go with you. Just don't kill him. \nEarly deliberates the situation, then eases up off the trigger... and smiles to Brian. \nThen, without warning, he hits Brian over the head with the butt of the .45 automatic. Brian falls to the floor unconscious. \nOMITTED \nEXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nAs Early finishes tieing one of the replicant bombs, Little Boy onto the hood. He reaches down and grabs a six pack of beer on the ground and shoves it in the back seat, then slides into the driver's seat next to an anxious Carrie. Carrie is now wearing one of Adele's floral dresses. \nEARLY Think anyone will notice? \nCarrie doesn't answer, Early laughs. \nINT. LINCOLN \nEarly looks out over the expanse of the desert. He sees a dirt fire road. \nEARLY I'll bet there's a 'door' out there... save us some time. \nCarrie doesn't understand what he means. Nonetheless, she nods her head in agreement. \nEXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE \nThe Lincoln heads out, past the cactus garden, into the darkness. \nTHE LINCOLN'S HEADLIGHTS REVEAL \nAdele's lifeless body on the ground near her beloved cacti. \nFADE TO BLACK WITH THE DEPARTING HEADLIGHTS \nINT.

He pivots around to see Mrs. Musgrave kneeling down to help him. \nEXT. DESERT - SAME TIME \nIn the distance, a cloud of dust reveals the Lincoln, traveling at high speed along the dirt fire road. \nINT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME \nEarly still behind the wheel. Carrie sits up against the passenger side door. She is tense and guarded. Out the window, nothing but empty desert. \nEARLY Pass me a beer hon'. \nCarrie quietly responds. She kneels on the front seat and reaches into the back. She grabs a bottle by its neck, and pulls it from the six pack of beer. Bottle in hand, she hesitates a moment... \nNEW ANGLE: EARLY'S POV IN THE DRIVING MIRROR \nEarly watches Carrie. \nEARLY You wanna hit me with that, huh? \n", "test3_true": "Carrie reconsiders and sits back in the far corner of the front seat. \nCARRIE (not looking at him) No. \nShe hands the bottle to him. Early reaches out for the beer, but instead of taking it, he clasps his hand over hers. \nHe looks at her and begins to squeeze... \nEARLY Stop lyin'... I can see right through you. \nEarly squeezes even harder -- Carrie begins to wince with pain. She waits for the glass bottle to shatter in her hand. \nEARLY Who d'ya think you're foolin'? (beat) I know you better than you think... \nCARRIE (confused) ...You're hurting me... \nEarly hits the brakes. The car screeches to a halt in a cloud of dust. Early squeezes on her hand even harder and begins to drag her toward him. \nEARLY I seen the way you been lookin' at me since we met... Snappin' my photo when you thought I wasn't lookin'. Wanting me... \nCarrie turns her head away. Early pulls her closer. \nEARLY I saw you when I killed that boy... \nHe grabs her hair with his other hand... Pulls her head around -- forcing her to look at him. Early has Carrie right up against him, looking right into her eyes. \nEARLY (whispers) You were plenty hot. \nCARRIE (explodes) You sick twisted fuck! You don't know shit about me. \nShe struggles trying to free herself. Early, his face only inches from hers, smiles... \nEARLY Sick... some people might say takin' photos of me and Adele humpin' in the back of the car is sick. \nCarrie struggles even harder, but Early tightens his hold. \nEARLY ...You know what I mean? \nCARRIE ...I know I'd love to smash this bottle right in your fucking face. \nSuddenly... Early releases Carrie, taking the beer from her. Carrie retreats back into the corner of the passenger side. \nEARLY That's better... Honesty... I like that in a woman. \nHe gives her a grin, then opens the bottle. \nEARLY But I'll tell ya... when we get to California, we're gonna have to do something 'bout that gutter mouth of yours. \nEarly takes a gulp of beer. \nEXT.

MUSGRAVE He's pulled out all the lines. The nearest phone is twenty miles east of here. \nBrian notices an old pickup truck parked outside. \nEXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - THE NEXT MOMENT \nAn anxious Brian hustles into the cab of the pickup truck. Some tools are in the back. Brian still wears the handcuffs around his wrists. Mrs. Musgrave stands near the front door. \nBRIAN Which way did they go? \nMRS. MUSGRAVE (pointing) He took the fire road. \nBRIAN Take your car and get to that phone. Call the police. \nBrian starts the pickup and drives off. \nEXT. DESERT - LATER \nThe wind has picked up. An old wooden gate blocks the fire road. On either side, barbed wire as far as the eye can see. The Lincoln roars into frame and powers through the barrier. \nThe gate smashes into splintered pieces of wood. \nINT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME \nCarrie leans against the passenger door. Early's eyes scan the open desert -- looking for the elusive 'doors.' Carrie reaches for her pack of cigarettes. Early, without a word, reaches out and takes the pack from her. He crumples it up and throws it out the window. \nNEW ANGLE \nCarrie's eyes go to the instrument panel. The temperature gauge is in the red. \nEXT. DESERT \nThe pickup truck arrives at a crossroads and skids to a halt. Brian tries to guess which direction to take. Then he spots Early's discarded beer bottle up ahead. The truck accelerates straight ahead, tires spinning. \nEXT. DESERT - LATER, THE SUN IS ON THE HORIZON \nThe winds continue to escalate, blowing harder and harder. The Lincoln approaches on the fire road. A trail of steam is streaming out from under the hood, blinding Early's view. \nFinally, Early slams on the brakes and skids 180 degrees to a halt... Steam pours out of the Lincoln's grill. The Lincoln has had it. \n", "test3_id": 2642}

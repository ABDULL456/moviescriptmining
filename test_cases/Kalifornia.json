{"train": "\"KALIFORNIA\" \nScreenplay by \nTim Metcalfe \nBased on a story by \nStephen Levy and Tim Metcalfe \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nEXT. - NIGHT \nIt's raining like hell. Flashes of lightning reveal momentary glimpses of a decayed urban/industrial landscape. Far below us, a mysterious glistening wet rock lies engulfed in the drowning earth. We descend toward the rock. Sporadic flashes of lightning distort our perspective of the stone. It looks strangely beautiful, like a diamond stuck in the dark mud... Closer... Closer... \nSuddenly, STRONG MALE HANDS cut across the frame and wrench it free from its muddy grave. Even closer... And we discover that the underbelly of this beautiful rock is teeming with every kind of slithering repulsive insect... FLASH!!* Lightning obliterates the frame. \n(* FLASHES OF LIGHT from lightning, car headlights, photographic strobe units and flashlights are used throughout the following sequences as recurring transitional devices.) \nCITY STREET EXT. NIGHT \nWe can barely see the darkened street in a run down part of an inner city -- what we can see looks half demolished. Flash!! \nThrough chain link fencing, the blinding headlights of a 70'S CHEVY arc into frame. For an instant we see the fleeting image of a PRETTY TEENAGE GIRL. On her feet a pair of bright red high heeled shoes. The Chevy pulls up next to her. \nINT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT \nFLASH!! An oncoming car's headlights streak across the beat up Chevy's windshield... revealing... THE DRIVER, 45ish, as he leans across the passenger seat and opens the car door. \nThe pretty teenage girl slides into the car. Dressed only in a skirt and T-Shirt, she's soaked to the skin. Make-up runs down her face and her hair sticks to her bare shoulders. She seems nervous... scared even. \nPRETTY TEENAGE GIRL Thanks. \nAs she closes the car door the man notices that her hand has been injured. It's bound with coarse white toweling and stained with blood. In her other hand, she clings tightly to a cheap yellow leather purse. He reaches forward and puts his hand on the gear-shift, the back of his hand brushing against her leg, she moves away. He slides the gear-shift into drive. \nAnother car's headlights flare the windshield as he pulls out into the night. \nINT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nSuddenly... a powerful photographic strobe light ignites! Revealing a decrepit warehouse interior. Silhouetted briefly against the paint chipped walls are two figures: A man, BRIAN KESSLER, 25, short chopped hair dressed in black on black, and a woman, CARRIE LAUGHLIN, 25, short black hair and tight black clothes. Carrie holds a 35mm still camera, an umbilical cord runs to a strobe light. Brian holds a flashlight in one hand, a tape recorder in the other. He begins speaking into the tape recorder. \nBRIAN Her father worked the night shift here. Most nights he'd bring her with him. (pause) She was eleven years old. \nHis flashlight scans the ominous environment. Carrie takes flash photo. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - NIGHT \nEmerging from the blackness... The same strong male hands that unearthed the rock now pulls his rain soaked jacket clear of his torso. A crude bandage wrapped around one of the fingers. The rock is slipped up under his jacket... up against his bare chest. The jacket is pulled down to conceal the rock and the faceless figure drifts away. \nINT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe beam of Brian's flashlight sweeps through the darkness, revealing another room. \nBRIAN This is it. This is the where he'd take her whenever he had the urge to molest her. \nThe flashlight finds the corner in question. Flash!! The warehouse lights up again, revealing a huge machine room. \nBRIAN Of course! Nobody would have heard her cries over the noise of the machines. \nINT. 70'S CHEVY - NIGHT \nA male hand wipes the steamy condensation clear of his car's front window. The windshield wipers swipe incessantly at the constant sheet of rain beyond. \nDRIVER Damn! This defroster never works... \nThe driver fidgets blindly with the various levers and knobs. He finally manages to get the defroster and heater to work. The girl leans forward into the stream of warm air. \nPRETTY TEENAGE GIRL ...Mmm... feels good. \nShe closes her eyes, lets it blow across her face. He watches her. His eyes linger on her body. \nDRIVER Have a problem with your car? \nShe pulls her wet hair off her bruised face and gives him a nervous smile. \nPRETTY TEENAGE GIRL No. (beat) My problem's with men. \nHe throws a curious look at her, then back to the highway. \nINT. ROOFLESS OLD WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nBrian's flashlight moves around the room. \nBRIAN This is where she murdered her first victim. They found his body over in the corner, shot through the head. \nThe flashlight continues to search through the darkness. \nBRIAN They found her second victim over there. \nAnother flash!!!!! \nINT. 70'S CHEVY \nVery close on the girl's yellow purse... as the metal zipper is pulled open. The driver notices her opening the purse. \nBrian walks ahead, Carrie trails behind him, peeling off her clothes. She begins unzipping her dress, unnoticed by Brian. \nBRIAN Tonight turned out to be pretty interesting. \nCARRIE The party? \nShe grabs a leather cap that sits on a chair. \nBRIAN The warehouse. I'm not that drunk. \nCARRIE It was definitely the high point of the evening. \nCarrie's dress falls to the floor. \nBRIAN (getting excited) Just being there where it really happened. It was different... more visceral. \nCARRIE Mmm... I love it when you talk like that. \nBrian is at the foot of the bed, he turns to see... Carrie has transformed. She has stripped down to her black bra and panties, fishnet stockings, a nightporter style leather cap. A surprised Brian stands there a moment. Looking at Carrie. She looks great. \nOMITTED \nCarrie pushes Brian back onto the bed. \nOMITTED \nCarrie climbs on top of him. She kisses his neck. Slowly starts working her lips across his chest and down his stomach. \nEXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING \nA solitary trailer sits alongside a run down house. \nINT. EARLY'S TRAILER - MORNING \nThrough the soot tinged atmosphere, sunlight filters in past the curtained windows. Early is lying face down in bed, his right arm extended over the side. Adele is in the kitchen half dressed, and unsuccessfully attempting to iron one of Early's shirts. She realizes the iron is out of water, she sets it down and steps to the sink and fills a glass with water. As she does she glances at a cactus on the counter. \nOMITTED \nADELE You thirsty Lucy? \nOMITTED \nShe waters her small cactus (Lucy). \nADELE Bet that feels good, don't it? \nNEW ANGLE - THE REFRIGERATOR \nAdele smiles then notices that a photo held to the fridge by a decorative magnet has fallen to the floor. She picks it up. \nADELE Now if that ain't Momma's little angel. \nAdele puts it back onto the fridge. It is a photo of a young Early with his mother. In the photo Early appears to be about ten or eleven. he stands next to his mother. Her arm is draped over his shoulders, she is holding a drink. A cigarette butt dangles between her fingers. Nearby a portable radio is tuned to music, when the local radio jingle comes on and segues to the news. \nNEW ANGLE ON EARLY \nA handkerchief bandana is tied around his head and over his eyes. \nThe NEWSCASTER'S voice gets louder. \nNEWSCASTER (O.S.) ...two more victims last night, when a twenty pound rock smashed through the windshield of their car... \nCLOSER - EARLY'S FACE \nSlowly he reaches to his face and lifts the bandana up off one eye. Even closer on his left eyelid. It flutters... pops open and blinks. Now... his eyeball stares right at us. The pitch black pupil contracts in the morning light. The newscaster's voice continues to amplify... \nNEWSCASTER This was the third such attack in the past month and while an extensive police operation is underway... no arrests have yet been made. \nThe newscaster's voice quickly fades away. Early calmly closes his eyes and drifts back to sleep. \nEXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE MORNING \nEarly emerges from the trailer drinking a bottle of beer. He looks around the yard, it's full of various kinds of useless junk. He walks over to his car. Adele appears in the doorway of the trailer in her bathrobe. \nADELE Early... \nShe glances around to make certain that no one's looking, then 'flashes' her body to Early with a giggle. \nADELE Have a good one. \nEarly smiles. Adele turns back into the trailer then, remembers... \nADELE Oh... I forgot to tell you, Mr. Diebold was by again yesterday. \nEarly looks at the run down house next door where Diebold lives. A beat up red pick-up is parked in front. \nADELE He said, if he ain't got the rest of his money by the end of the month, he's gonna \"kick us the... (spells the word fuck to avoid saying it) F-U-C-K outta here.\" \nEarly works his jaw, thinking. \nEARLY He said that, huh? Cursed in front of you? \nAdele nods. \nADELE You gonna talk to him? \nEARLY I ain't got nothing against God. It's the people he let come into the world... lot of them should have been stopped at the door. What are you looking for? \nThe Parole Officer ignores the question. He steps up to a sink overflowing with dirty dishes. \nPAROLE OFFICER That girlfriend of yours ain't much for housekeeping, is she. \nEarly dismisses the place with a glance. \nEARLY I'm thinking about moving... \nEarly opens the refrigerator, grabs a bottle of beer. \nEARLY Maybe down to Texas... Probably get some work on them offshore oil rigs. Hear the pay's good... hell, the weather's got to be better'n here. \nEarly sits down at the table. The Parole Officer steps over to him. \nPAROLE OFFICER What are you talking about? You know you can't leave the state. (hiccup) What you can do is get a job. \nThe Parole Officer pulls a slip of paper from his shirt pocket, sets it on the table. \nPAROLE OFFICER You be at this personnel office, Friday, three o'clock sharp. \nEARLY What is it? \nPAROLE OFFICER ...Janitor's job. \nEARLY Oh man... come on, I don't want no janitor job. \nEarly lifts his beer for another drink. The Parole Officer's prosthetic hand snaps tight around the neck of the beer bottle, just inches from Early's lips. \nPAROLE OFFICER Hey, I don't give two shits about what you want or don't want... I'm telling you to be there Friday, three o'clock sharp or the sheriff will be here for dinner. You understand? \nWith that Early looks up at the man, almost defiantly, then stands up. The Parole Officer hiccups again. Early stares at him for a moment. \nEARLY You oughta think about putting a bag over your head... Might cure them hiccups. \nThe Parole Officer shakes his head in disgust and walks out of the trailer to his car. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nBRIAN'S DESK IN ANOTHER PART OF LOFT APARTMENT - NIGHT \nBrian's in the midst of working his way through pages and pages of thesis notes scattered atop his desk. Using chopsticks he shovels Chinese straight out of the carton as he studies Carrie's warehouse photographs. \nCARRIE'S POV \nAs we approach Brian from behind, moving closer, closer. \nNEW ANGLE - BRIAN'S DESK \nCarrie steps up behind him. She's rubbing her eyes, having just awakened. A hangover beckons. Brian notices her. \nBRIAN Hey. I didn't have the heart to wake you. \nCARRIE Thanks. What are you doing? \nBRIAN Well, I sat down with my tapes and your photographs, which are great by the way... and I started writing. \nCarrie grabs his container of Chinese and takes a few bites. Listens. \nCARRIE So how's it going? \nBRIAN ...I think it's the best stuff I've done. \nCarrie glances over his shoulder at his writing. \nBRIAN ...and I think I know why. \nCARRIE Why? \nBRIAN Because I was there. And for a moment that night I understood how she came to pull the trigger. \nCARRIE (sarcastic) This mean your finally going to finish your thesis? \nBRIAN Look, fuck the thesis. I think there's a book here. Your photographs and my research, together. \nCARRIE A book on the warehouse murders? \nBRIAN A book on some of the most infamous murderers in America. I want to go to where they lived and where they killed and I want you to photograph it. \nBrian reaches down to the floor and pulls a large map of the United States up and lays it out on his desk. He traces a route West. Along the way, specific locations have been circled. \nBRIAN What I'm thinking is, we can drop down through Tennessee, across Arkansas and into Texas, from there it's a straight shot into California. (pause) \"We don't stop... until we hit the fucking ocean.\" \nOMITTED \nCARRIE It's about fucking time, Kessler! I'd just about given up on you. \nBRIAN We don't have enough money, but we'll figure something out. \nCarrie steps up to Brian. \nBRIAN ...It's either the best idea I've had in a long time... or there's way too much MSG in this stuff. \nEXT. EARLY'S TRAILER - LATE THAT NIGHT \nAdele steps out of the trailer. \nADELE Early? \nShe walks carefully around the junk piles. It's dark; hard to see. She comes to the edge of a deep dark hole and peers in... She can't see anything but hears the rustling of a shovel digging. \nADELE Early? You down there? \nThe sound of digging stops. \nEARLY (from inside the hole) What's up Adele? Dinner ready? \nADELE Almost. \nAfter a moment's hesitation, Early resumes his digging. \nADELE Early... \nThe digging stops again. \nADELE Tell me more about California. \nThe moonlight illuminates his face when he looks up at her. \nEARLY Well... for one thing... They think faster out there, on account of all that warm weather they got; cold weather makes people stupid, that's a fact. \nADELE I guess that'd explain why there's so many stupid people around here. \nEARLY Yeah, and in California you never have to buy fruit 'cause it's all on the trees everywhere you turn... (beat) ...and, 'course there ain't no speed limit out there, and all drugs are legal... And I heard your first month's rent is free; state law. I figure 'til we get settled we can just move around month to month... \nADELE What'll we do out there? \nEARLY Well... the very first thing we're gonna do... is get us a couple of six packs of Lucky Lager and climb up on toppa' that famous Hollywood sign and howl at the moon... \nEarly lets out a playful howl, as Adele looks up over her shoulder at the moon. \nADELE You know... I read once... Ain't nothin' on that big old moon 'cept some old golf balls those astronauts left behind. \nEARLY Bull. That ain't right... Government sends people there all the time, just don't want us to know about it. \nAdele smiles and begins walking back to the trailer. \nADELE Don't be long now, dinner's 'bout ready. \nEARLY I heard that. \nAfter a moment, Early climbs out of the hole and stands in the moonlight for a moment. We see that he's completely naked except for a pair of high top steel toed work boots. Early gazes up into the night sky, looking at the cold white moon. \nEXT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT - DAWN \nBrian exits loft carrying two bags. Carrie is also carrying a bag, and smoking a cigarette, as they walk to the car. \nCARRIE What did he sound like on the phone? \nOMITTED \nBRIAN Real polite. Kept calling me 'sir.' \nBrian throws the bags in the open trunk with the other bags. \nBRIAN (grins) I like that. \nCARRIE I still think we should have met them first. \nBRIAN Beggars can't be choosers. They were the only ones who answered the ride share note, remember? \nCarrie bows her head and folds her hands in mock prayer. \nCARRIE Please God, we're gonna be stuck with these people for a week, don't let them be as boring as Brian's friends. Anything... but that. \nBrian throws a needling glance to Carrie and slams the car hood shut. They both get into the car, Brian behind the wheel. \nINT. LINCOLN \nBRIAN Oh, yeah... He had a real thick accent right outta \"Deliverance.\" (quotes from the movie) \"Still? Who said anything about a still? Get ya ass up in them woods!\" \nCARRIE Funny, very funny. \nBrian starts the car. It backfires loudly startling Carrie. Brian laughs. \nBRIAN (quoting again) \"Aintry? This river don't go to Aintry.\" \nEXT. LINCOLN ON STREET \nThe engine revs again and the Lincoln pulls away down the street. \nEXT. BUS STATION - DAWN \nPAN UP from Adele's new red high-heeled shoes. We hear Adele speaking with an unfamiliar tone of authority to her voice. \nADELE We shouldn't be doin' this, Early. You leavin' the state, ridin' around with strangers... besides, what kinda people would want to stop at places where other people was murdered. \nThe camera slowly reveals Adele... and the fact that she is alone as she voices her concerns. Then from behind her Early approaches. Just in time to hear... \nBrian looks to him, Early grins and winks. Brian slams the Lincoln trunk lid shut. \nSCREEN TO BLACK \nEXT. EARLY'S BURNING TRAILER - DAWN \nFrom the blackness... The camera rises from a pile of rubble. As it ascends we reveal Diebold's pitbulls howling and digging at a mound of fresh earth where Early's hole used to be. \nThe crackling flames of a nearby fire illuminate the scene. Deep in the distance, the wail of approaching sirens. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nReveal that it's Early's trailer and car that are on fire. \nINT. TRAILER \nFlames consume the magazine photos of Elvis and Priscilla, Farrah and Ryan, Early and Adele. Along with them, the black and white photo of young Early and his mother. \nEXT. BUS STATION - DAWN - OVERHEAD ANGLE \nOn the Lincoln as it exits the Bus Station. The camera descends toward a lone trash can, to find there, lying amidst the debris inside... Adele's cactus. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - MORNING \nThe Lincoln passes through on its way out of town. \nINT. MOVING LINCOLN - MORNING \nBrian behind the wheel, Carrie riding shotgun. Early and Adele are sitting in the back seat. An awkward silence prevails. Brian clears his throat. \nBRIAN Uh, we can stop somewhere if you and Adele haven't had time for breakfast, Early. \nEARLY Well, it's like this, Mr. Kessler. \nBRIAN Brian. \nEARLY Well, it's like this, Bri'. I don't eat much in the mornin', never have. Maybe a beer once in a while; Lucky Lager's my favorite. \nBrian raises his eyebrow a tad, but is not really curious about it. \nADELE It's because of what he read in a book once... That folks needin' breakfast is a myth, or whatever, put out by those cereal people. \nA glance passes between Brian and Carrie. Is she for real? \nCARRIE'S POV - IN VANITY MIRROR \nEarly motions Adele not to talk so much. \nNEW ANGLE \nBRIAN So what do you do Early? \nEARLY Oh... I do some work up at the Merrick Mirror factory, or I used to... \nADELE One night we figured out how much bad luck he must have comin' from all them mirrors he broke... (beat) Four hundred and ninety four years to work it all off... After he dies, he'll have to keep coming back to earth over and over and over... \nCARRIE Karma. \nAdele and early show no sign of understanding the word. \nADELE What? \nCARRIE Karma... (beat) You know, if you do something bad to somebody fate will pay you back by something bad happening to you. \nADELE That French ain't it? \nCarrie glances at the odometer on the dash... THE FIRST MILE clicks over. \nEXT. LINCOLN - OUTSKIRTS OF THE CITY \nEveryone takes a last look at the familiar countryside. Carrie is snapping photos of the twisting concrete overpasses and the gloomy grey sky beyond. \nINT. LINCOLN \nAdele watches Carrie, intrigued by the obvious skill Carrie shows with the camera. Brian glances into the rear-view mirror at Adele. \nBRIAN So Adele, did Early happen to mention the places we'll be stopping at? \nON ADELE'S REFLECTION IN MIRROR... then Early leans in front of her. \nEARLY Yeah Bri' I did. \nAdele leans against Carrie's front seat. \nADELE (to Carrie) Are you takin' the pictures? \nCARRIE (surprised) ...Yeah. \nADELE Is it hard to learn? \nCARRIE Not really. \nEarly pulls Adele back toward the back seat. \nEARLY (to Brian) You gonna talk to the people who did those murders? \nCarrie points the camera at a smiling Adele and snaps the first picture. \nCARRIE You just aim and press the button. \nAdele takes the camera. \nINT. LINCOLN \nAdele focuses her camera at the scenery out the side window of the car. \nADELE Look, Pigeon Forge! \nADELE'S POV \nRoad sign to Pigeon Forge. \nEXT. LINCOLN \nAdele leans out the side rear window to get a better view. \nADELE I've heard of that! It's where Dolly Parton has her park. \"Dollywood\". I just think that's so clever. Hollywood. Dollywood. Get it? \nWith that, she plops back down into the back seat. \nINT. LINCOLN \nEARLY (under his breath) Shush, Adele. \nADELE Early, can we stop there... just for a little while. \nEXT. HIGHWAY \nAs we see the car disappearing into the distance, we can still hear Adele rambling on. \nADELE (O.S.) ...I've always wanted to go there... It could be such fun. \nFADE OUT: \nEXT. LARGE ISOLATED OLD FARM - AFTERNOON \nThe Lincoln approaches on a dirtroad and passes a mailbox with the name \"BAXTER\" on it. The Lincoln turns into the long driveway. \nINT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME \nBrian begins talking into a small portable tape recorder. \nBRIAN The Novaks are all gone but the fence that Michael Zaruba was hired to put up is still here. \nHe glances to Carrie, who fires off several photos of the fence and yard. \nThe Lincoln continues slowly down the long drive... Up ahead through the windshield Brian sees a beautiful old farm house. \nBRIAN The Novaks embraced the young drifter as one of their own. \nEXT. LINCOLN \nThe Lincoln slows to a halt. Carrie and Brian exit the car and begin walking toward the house. Early follows. Adele, uncertain about what's transpiring, trails behind. \nADELE Hey you two. \nBrian and Carrie turn to see... Adele training a camera on them. \nADELE Give me a smile now. \nBrian and Carrie look to one another then force a weak smile. Early jumps in and throws a pair of devil's horns up behind Brian's unsuspecting head as... the shutter clicks. \nBrian and Carrie quickly turn their attention back on the house. \nBRIAN (continues into tape recorder) Neighbors said he was a quiet young man, who was often seen pushing the children on the swing set. \nAn unusual bird house and a tricycle sit in the front yard. To the side of the house are the remains of an old swing set. Carrie finds an interesting angle on the swing set, with the house in the background, SNAP! She fires off a shot. \nBRIAN (continuing) Everything was fine until the day the family ran out of work for Michael, and had to ask him to leave. \nAs Carrie frames up another shot, Early crosses in front of her camera. Realizing he is in Carrie's photo he stops and poses. Carrie looks to Brian. \nBRIAN Sorry, Early... Could you step out the way, for a second? \nEarly is surprised that they don't want him in the photograph. He wanders away from the front of the house. Meanwhile, Adele photographs the moment. \nBRIAN The first one to die was the nine year old daughter... \nJust then... A NINE YEAR OLD GIRL comes running from around the side of the house. She stops dead when she sees all of them. Carrie snaps a final photo. \nBRIAN Hello. \nThe little girl scans all their faces. \nBRIAN ...My name's Brian, what's yours? \nThe little girl remains silent. Brian rolls a look to Carrie then back to the little girl. \nBRIAN ...Could I speak to your parents? \nAfter an awkward pause, the little girl silently crosses the yard to the porch and opens the front door. \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. - LINCOLN PULLS UP TO MOTEL AND PARKS. \nINT. MOTEL RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA small roadside diner. A fair number of people inside having dinner. Adele, Early, Carrie, and Brian are seated at one of the tables. \nAT THEIR TABLE \nCarrie watches Early eat with a kind of horrible, rude fascination. He has no table manners at all. He eats with his elbows on the table, fork wedged in the fist of his right hand. All the while, he chews with his mouth open. He's serious about his \"eating.\" \nBRIAN (studying his map) Well we've come three hundred miles so far. Not a bad day's haul. \nEarly doesn't bother to respond. He keeps eating. \nBRIAN You got any family or friends in California, Early? \nCU ANGLE ON EARLY \nWith a piece of bread he mops up the gravy on his plate. \nEARLY (chewing) Nope... You? \nANGLE UNDER THE TABLE \nEarly's foot itches... He tries to scratch it but it doesn't do any good. \nBRIAN (O.S.) No. \nADELE (O.S.) Me neither. How 'bout you Carrie? \nCARRIE (O.S.) No. \nANGLE - THE GROUP \nAs Brian folds up the map. Early takes off his boot, then his well-worn sock. Carrie's look of disgust grows as Early brings his foot up onto his lap and scratches it while he eats. Carrie puts her fork down: dinner is over for her. \nADELE ...Well, least we got each other. That's somethin'. \nOMITTED \nOMITTED \nBrian looks up, sees Carrie's expression... Then what's causing it... Early mops up the last bit of food on his plate. He notices Brian and Carrie staring at him and slowly puts his foot back down on the floor -- then the sock. \nBrian picks up the check to see the total... Starts pulling his wallet out... Isn't quite sure how to bring up the tab to Early. \nEARLY Thanks Bri', I'll get the next one. (prompts Adele) Think it's time we hit the sack. \nEarly winks at Brian, Carrie catches the wink. Early and Adele get up and head for the door. Adele waves goodnight. \nADELE (to Carrie) Sweet dreams. \nINT. CARRIE AND BRIAN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nClose on Carrie, she is reflected in a mirror. Reveal, Carrie wearing only a T-shirt is at the vanity angrily brushing her teeth. In the bathroom next to her, a bath is running. In the adjacent bedroom, Brian is in the bed working on his notes. \nINT. BATHROOM \nCARRIE (spits out a mouthful of water) You mean because I object to having somebody take off their shoe and scratch their foot while I'm eating I'm prejudiced? \nINT. BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nBRIAN (reading notes) He can't help the way he was raised. I kinda feel sorry for him. \nINT. BATHROOM \nCarrie pauses in brushing her teeth. \nCARRIE Feel sorry for him? Obviously you didn't get a whiff of that sock? \nBRIAN (O.S.) Bitch, bitch, bitch! \nCARRIE (under her breath) Up yours. \nBRIAN I heard that. \nINT. BATHROOM \nCarrie finishes brushing her teeth. Secretively she gives Brian the finger... \nBRIAN (O.S.) ...heard that too. \nCarrie glances at the bath water running in the tub. It's rusty brown and disgusting. She pulls the plug on the bath idea. \nINT. EARLY AND ADELE'S MOTEL BATHROOM ROOM - SAME TIME \nThe tap is running at the sink as Early empties the stolen purse. He adds the last few coins to a small pile of cash. \nEARLY Can you believe thirty bucks for this room... for what? A lumpy mattress, that crummy TV and a crapper. \nADELE (O.S.) Early, sing me a song. \nEarly continues to sift through all the items from the purse. \nEarly lifts his beer bottle in salute. \nEARLY Bri'. \nCARRIE Where's Adele? \nEARLY She wasn't feeling so good. \nThe WAITRESS arrives with a menu, offers it to Early. \nWAITRESS Breakfast? \nEARLY (burps) Nah... Don't eat breakfast. Never have. \nThe Waitress notices Early's bottle of beer. \nWAITRESS Ah sir... sir. \nShe gets Early's attention. \nWAITRESS (concerned) We ah... don't have a liquor license here. So I'm afraid... \nEARLY Well don't be, I got plenty more where this one came from. \nThe Waitress gives him a curious look and walks away. \nJust then, Brian look past Early... A surprised expression crosses Brian's face. Early turns to see... Adele approaching the table. Her hair has been crudely chopped to resemble Carrie's. It looks like shit. \nCARRIE (at a loss for words) You cut your hair. \nAdele smiles, pleased with Carrie for noticing. She sits down next to Brian. \nADELE Early cut it. (smiles at Early) ...Once he gets an idea in his head there's no holding him back. \nCarrie looks to Brian curiously. Adele is distracted by a small cactus on the window near the table. \nBRIAN Nice job Early. \nCarrie notices Adele's 'new' (stolen) purse... We see the wheels turning in Carrie's head. How? Where? \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. MOTEL - LATER \nEarly walks toward the Lincoln. It is parked outside Brian and Carrie's room. The front door is ajar, he pushes it open. He sees Carrie's reflection in the bathroom mirror, she's in her underwear, pulling on her jeans. Early watches her for a moment. There's no mistaking what's on his mind... as his eyes scan her body. Carrie pulls on her T-shirt, steps out of the bathroom and sees Early just outside the door. \nEARLY ...Need a hand with those bags? \nCARRIE No, thanks, I can manage. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME \nCarrie turns back to the dresser and gathers up the last few things. She glances into the dresser mirror looking for Early's reflection at the door, but he's gone. Relieved, she turns the corner to grab her bags and finds Early standing right there! Looking at her. He startles her. \nEARLY I got 'em. \nHe picks up her bags and walks out of the room. Carrie watches him, then she steps to the doorway. \nBRIAN (O.S.) All set? \nCARRIE (startled) Fuck! \nBRIAN Take your time. \nCARRIE LOOKS BACK TO EARLY \nCARRIE'S POV - EXT. MOTEL \nEarly places the bags in the Lincoln's trunk. Adele sees Early carrying Carrie's bag, Adele looks jealous. \nEXT. MOTEL \nIn the foreground Carrie's door closes. \nTO BLACK. \nEXT. LINCOLN/HIGHWAY - LATER \nLincoln passes through frame. \nINT. MOVING LINCOLN - NOON \nBrian at wheel, Carrie next to him loading her camera. Early in the back seat, Adele next to him pulls out some make up from her bag, we see the little cactus from the motel lobby. She begins to put on some lipstick. Early reaches into the frontseat and grabs the manuscript that sits between Brian and Carrie. \nEARLY (starts to read) This the book your writing? \nBRIAN It's just a work in progress, kinda rough. \nEARLY This guy killed a mess of people. \nBRIAN Who? \nEARLY Henry Lucas. \nEarly turns to see a late model Mercedes behind him. He just gazes at the driver. Aggravated, the driver leans on the horn and motions Early out of his way. Early stares at the man a moment longer, then steps to one side and lets the car pull past him. \nWIDE ON THE GAS STATION \nA FAT MAN in his late thirties exits from behind the wheel of the Mercedes. Early watches him as he takes a money clip from his pocket and walks toward the entrance to the mini market. \nEXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND \nThe gas meter dial continues to go around. $$$$$ Click... Click... Click... \nNEW ANGLE \nThe girls leaning against the car. Adele watches Carrie take a drag on her cigarette. \nADELE I used to smoke before I met Early. But he broke me of that. \nHer remark gets Carrie's attention. \nCARRIE Broke you? \nON EARLY \nHe watches the Fat Man inside the office. \nEARLY'S POV - EXT./INT. GAS STATION \nThe Fat Man pays THE ATTENDANT for gas and is handed the restroom key. \nEXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND \nBrian walks to the front of the Lincoln. He passes Carrie and Adele... \nADELE Early don't think women should smoke or curse or drink liquor. \nCARRIE So you don't do any of those things. \nCarrie takes a quick look to the mini-market. She's lost sight of Early. \nADELE Better not, or Early'd whip me. \nCARRIE (back to Adele) He whips you? \nINT./EXT. BATHROOM \nThe Fat Man turns the key and enters the bathroom. The door starts to swing shut behind him, but... \nTWO FINGERS catch it before it does. \nADELE (O.S.) Only when I deserve it. \nEXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND \nBrian lifts the hood of the Lincoln... Reaches for the radiator cap. \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe Fat Man is standing at the urinal. He has a ureterostomy bag he's emptying, when... \nEarly's hand hits the blow dryer. A whirring sound fills the room. The Fat Man turns his head. Early lunges at him from behind, yanks his head back and rips a switchblade across his throat! \nEXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND - CU \nA BLAST of steam from the radiator startles Brian! \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe Fat Man clutches at his throat. Sees the blood on his palms. He looks up in shock. Early pounds the man's head into the wall. \nEXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND \nBrian checking the oil, pulls out the dip stick. \nNEW ANGLE: CU \nBlack oil runs down the metal blade. \nINT. BATHROOM \nThe Fat Man falls to his knees against the urinal. His hand grasping the lever. The urinal flushes. Water flows. The Fat Man's blood mixes with it. The urinal overflows. The blood tinged water spills onto the white tile floor. Early pries the dead man's fist off the lever. \nEXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND \nBrian slams the Lincoln's hood shut. \nINT. BATHROOM \nEarly struggles to turn the fat corpse over. \nEXT. GAS PUMP ISLAND \nBrian steps up to the gas nozzle and pulls it out of the car. \nINT. BATHROOM \nEarly reaches in the dead man's pocket and removes his money clip. \nADELE (to Carrie) You lose! \nBRIAN (to Early) I suppose anything's possible. \nBrian puts one leg across the other and goes back to his notes. \nNEW ANGLE: CLOSE UP BRIAN'S SHOE \nRevealing... the blood encrusted toe of his shoe. \nNEW ANGLE: CU ON EARLY \nEARLY You ever play any pool Bri'? \nEARLY'S POV \nUp ahead a HONKY TONK BAR with a large sign \"POOL TABLES, BOWLING & MUSIC\" \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD \nThe Lincoln passes by the LARGE SIGN. \nBRIAN (O.S.) I can hold my own... \nEXT. MOTEL - DUSK \nA high angle looks down on the modest cluster of rooms below. The motel sign pulses erratically in foreground. Moths flicker about the light. \nCLOSER \nThe Lincoln is parked in front of Brian and Carrie's room. The horn honks. Early is behind the wheel, engine running. Brian steps out of the motel room. \nCARRIE (O.S.) Hey Minnesota Fats! \nCarrie appears at the door holding her camera. \nCARRIE (sarcastic) Don't forget your key. \nShe hands Brian the key. \nBRIAN Why'd I open my big mouth? \nBrian takes the key and walks to the car. \nCarrie sees Adele standing outside her door. Brian enters the Lincoln. \nCARRIE (to Adele) Why didn't you go with them? \nThe Lincoln pulls away. \nADELE I told you how Early feels 'bout a woman drinking. \nCARRIE How'd you meet Early? \nCarrie swings the camera around to Adele, and snaps off a shot. \nADELE (grins) I was hitchhiking' one day and he picked me up. At first I wasn't gonna get in on account of his car was in such sorry shape. I said, \"I ain't never seen a white man drivin' a car like this.\" \nCarrie snaps another shot of Adele. Every once in a while Adele feels like she should be \"posing\" for the shots that Carrie's taking of her. So, occasionally, as she carries on her conversation with Carrie, she does. \nCARRIE'S POV THRU CAMERA \nADELE (continues) An' he said right back, \"You shouldn't judge by appearances little lady... this vehicle might just be a flying saucer disguised as a car, for all you know.\" \nCARRIE'S POV THRU CAMERA - AS SHE ZOOMS IN TIGHTER ON ADELE \nADELE Well, I got in and we got to talkin', and the next thing I know, I'd moved in with him in this old trailer. (beat) Hey! Wouldn't it be something if we all ended up sharing a house together in California? \nON CARRIE \nShe lowers the camera from her eye and studies Adele. \nCARRIE You know I can fix that haircut for you, if you want? \nADELE You can? \nEXT. BOWLING ALLEY BAR - NIGHT \nA nondescript \"joint\" on the outskirts of town. American cars. American pickup trucks parked outside. The Lincoln pulls into foreground and parks. Early gets out of the Lincoln and looks around. \nEARLY I wonder if there's any \"doors\" out here? \nBrian exits the Lincoln and looks at Early questioning. \nEARLY You know... \"openings\" to other dimensions. (pause) I read there are a lot of them out West, mostly in the desert. They say if you know what you're doing, you can travel anywhere in the Universe in a matter of seconds. Wouldn't that come in handy? \nBrian looks at him blankly. He can't think of a thing to say in response. Early walks toward the entrance of the bar. Brian joins him. \nBRIAN By the way, I'm not much of a pool player. \nEARLY Shit, it ain't hard to play pool. I can teach you everything ya need ta know. \nBRIAN Yeah? \nEARLY Hell yeah! I'll even spot ya a few points first game. \nNEW ANGLE ON BRIAN \nHe watches the waitress disappear into the crowd, then turns to find the Large Young Cracker in his face! \nYOUNG CRACKER What did you say to her city boy! \nThe Young Cracker is obviously very drunk. \nBRIAN Nothing, I jus... \nYOUNG CRACKER (cuts him off) What's a jism gargling cum drunk fairy like you looking at a pretty girl like that for anyway? \nThe Young Cracker doesn't notice Early return from the bathroom. He moves in next to Brian. Early is relaxed and nonchalant as he looks over the Young Cracker. He leans closer to Brian. \nEARLY (matter of factly) You'd better hit him first Bri', 'cos it's comin'. \nWith his eyes on Brian, Early grabs a beer. Brian is scared, and confused, with one ear and one eye on the Young Cracker, the other on Early. \nYOUNG CRACKER This yur' boyfriend? \nBRIAN (dumbfounded) What? \nEARLY Hit him. \nEarly looks at the beer. \nEARLY (angry) Bri' this shit ain't Lucky Lager! \nEarly takes a swig off the beer, grimaces and sprays it out. It hits the Young Cracker. The Cracker looks down at his shirt in shock. Early is oblivious. \nYOUNG CRACKER (to Early) Hey Asshole! \nBrian is frozen, confused, doesn't know who to address. Early continues to ignore the Young Cracker. \nBRIAN They don't stock it here Early. \nYOUNG CRACKER (to Early, furious) Why you fuckin'... \nThe Young Cracker moves to hit Early. Early swiftly smashes his beer bottle into the oncoming face. The Young Cracker doubles over clutching his face in agony. Early kicks him in the face, sending the Young Cracker to the ground. Early finishes him off with several more kicks from his heavy work boots. \nTwo large tough guys approach Early and Brian. Brian's heart racing, Early cool as a cucumber. Instead of taking on Early, they stop, reach down and drag the unconscious man away. The waitress returns to their table. \nWAITRESS Sorry about that, he's always causing trouble. \nShe sets down two beers and two shots, doubles. \nWAITRESS These are on the house. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. CARRIE AND BRIAN'S MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nCarrie and Adele split the last bottle of beer between them. They are sitting on the floor and Adele has Carrie's foot in her lap. She's painting Carrie's toenails bright red. Neither of them is feeling any pain. \nADELE My momma's a beautician. Guess that's where I get it from. She wouldn't hear of my moving in with Early... on account of his just getting out of jail and all. Ain't seen her in nearly a year now. I wish she'd call me, just once. \nCARRIE (interrupting) What's Early been in jail for? \nADELE (reluctantly) Carryin' a gun. \nCARRIE ...Anything else? \nADELE An' resistin' arrest... At least that's what the Police said. \nCARRIE Jeez... Adele! \nAdele realizes she has said too much, looks at her watch. \nADELE I'd better be goin'. It's late. \nAdele hastily weaves her way out the door. \nCARRIE Great. \nCarrie stares down at her feet. Red toenails. Cottonballs between the toes. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. THE BOWLING ALLEY BAR \nEarly and Brian exit the bar. They make their way to the Lincoln. On the way... \nEARLY Got to see a man about a mule. \nBrian looks at Early, doesn't understand. \nEARLY Gotta take a piss. \nEarly branches off behind the car. \nEARLY Any reebs left in the back seat? \nBrian presses a button on the audio cassette player. The small tinny speaker plays a bad recording of something we slowly come to realize is the unmistakable sounds of a woman being tortured and pleading for her life. \nFLASH!! FLASH!! \nCarrie fires off a series of shots from different angles. Brian scans the place trying to imagine what happened. Screams from the audio tape bounce off the walls. \nBRIAN (speaks into his small hand held tape recorder) His mother had him working in here before he was eight years old... killing animals with a sledgehammer that was bigger than he was. \nBrian and Carrie walk through the remains of a doorway into another room. \nBRIAN When she was pissed at him, she'd beat the shit out of him and lock him in here overnight... \nThe pleas for help and screams on the tape subside to a steady whimpering. \nBRIAN (continuing) ...Eventually the boy wakes up one morning, picks up that sledgehammer and starts hurting back. \nFLASH!! FLASH!! \nCarrie takes a few more shots of the ominous interior. Then she stops, turns and walks out of the room. She's had enough. Brian follows after her. \nBRIAN There's more... \nCARRIE I'm finished. \nCarrie stops to pick up the rest of her gear. \nBRIAN Look... I know you're pissed off about the gun, and I don't blame you... \nCarrie wheels around to face him. \nCARRIE Brian, I'm not pissed off. God damm it, turn that thing off. \nShe switches off the cassette player. \nCARRIE I'm scared. A week ago you would never have even thought to pick up that gun. This afternoon you're out there wielding it around like Clyde fucking Barrow, for Christ's sake! What's with you? \nBRIAN Okay, it was a cheap thrill, it was stupid, I admit it, alright? (pause) But let's not blow this. Not now... Let's just get the photos. \nCARRIE I can't believe I agreed to do this. \nOMITTED \nBRIAN Oh come on, don't give me that shit... you wanted to take these photos as much as I wanted you too. \nCARRIE Wrong! I was willing to do whatever it took to get you up off your ass and on the way to California... There's a big difference. \nCarrie storms out of the place. She exits the tunnel, and makes her way toward... \nTHE LINCOLN \nAs she approaches it, through the rear windshield she sees... Early and Adele fucking wildly! \nCarrie wants to turn away, but she can't stop watching them. Fascinated, she raises the camera to her eye and zooms in on them. \nTHROUGH CARRIE'S CAMERA LENS: ON EARLY AND ADELE \nEarly is sitting against the back seat. Adele is straddling him. Carrie's finger finds the shutter button. \nEarly's arms move up under Adele's dress... Her hands press up against the roof. She's trembling... Wavering... Carrie's finger presses down on the button, CLICK!! \nThen in one swift movement Early sweeps Adele onto the back seat. Close on Early's face. He's sweating... Lips moving... Talking dirty to Adele. \nKeeping her finger on the button, Carrie rapid fires through a whole roll of film. She's oblivious to the whine of the motor drive once all the film is shot out. \nThen unexpectedly!! Early looks directly into the camera, at Carrie. And smiles... And continues to fuck Adele. \nA chill rushes through Carrie, she almost drops the camera. She runs back toward the tunnel... and right into Brian's arms. He startles her. She pulls away from him. \nCARRIE Brian I want him out of our car! \nBRIAN Why, what did he do? \nCARRIE Brian get him out of the car. Next gas station either he leaves or I do! \nOMITTED \nEXT. DESERT - DUSK \nThe Lincoln passes through frame. In the background, the surreal image of an industrial complex bathed in an eerie artificial light. \nINT. LINCOLN PULLS INTO A GAS STATION - TWILIGHT \nAn electrical storm is in full swing. \nEXT. GAS STATION \nThe Lincoln barely comes to a stop at the pumps before Carrie storms out of the car and heads toward the gas station interior. She leaves Brian to break the news to Adele and Early. \nINT. GAS STATION \nThe only person inside is a YOUNG MALE ATTENDANT. He's watching TV behind the counter as Carrie enters. On the TV we see a NEWSMAN. We only catch fragments of what he is saying because the storm outside is affecting the TV reception. \nCARRIE Twenty dollars in the tank and a carton of cigarettes. \nIn fact, each time the lightning flashes occur all of the electrical power at the station is affected. The fluorescent lights outside and inside begin to flicker and falter sporadically. \nATTENDANT Not so good. You sure you have to? \nEARLY I don't know. Wish I did. \nCARRIE Early, just think... \nEARLY Shut your mouth. \nINT. LINCOLN \nAdele opens the door on the driver's side looking scared. Brian is in the passenger seat. He's looking in the glove compartment for a map. The .45 automatic Early gave Brian is clearly visible. Adele stares at it. \nBRIAN Adele, what are you doing back here? \nAdele gets in and starts looking under the seats. \nADELE ...Lost my purse... Could you help me look for it? It's probably under the seat. \nINT. GAS STATION \nThe Attendant is reaching up, handing Early the money from his pockets. Carrie is seated in front of him. \nEARLY Where you from Walter? \nATTENDANT (nervous shake) Vernon, Florida. \nEARLY Never heard of it, any huntin'? \nATTENDANT Turkey mostly. \nEARLY Turkey's are real smart. Smarter than most people think... \nEarly rips the phone out of the wall. \nEARLY Tell you what Walter, you lie down there now... You make sure you stay put for a while after we leave... Okay? \nThe attendant nods yes. \nATTENDANT ...Mind if I hold that Bible? \nEARLY What do you need a Bible for? \nThe attendant has no response. \nEARLY You think I'm goin' to kill you. Well that'd make me a liar then wouldn't it? \nATTENDANT No sir. \nEarly takes the Bible off the desk and hands it down to the Attendant. \nEARLY Here you go. \nThe frightened young man lies face down on his stomach clutching the Bible and starts to pray. \nOn the counter next to him Early notices a large stuffed \"happy face\" display. \"Free with every 20 gallon purchase.\" \nHe grabs one, stares at its face curiously. \nEARLY (mumbles to himself) I wonder if Adele would like one of these? (beat) Nah... \nSuddenly... He puts the barrel of the gun between the \"happy face\" eyes... Points it at the back of the attendant's head. \nCarrie begins to scream. Early pulls the trigger. \nThe blast explodes the \"happy face\" and rips into the back of the Attendant's head, killing him. \nINT. LINCOLN - SIMULTANEOUSLY \nA thunderous crackle of lightning all but masks the gunshot. The rain starts pouring down. \nBRIAN What was that? \nAdele stares blankly back. \nINT. GAS STATION \nThe room fills with billowing down stuffing. As the stuffing floats to the floor it sticks to their hair, skin and clothes... \nEARLY (surprised at the feathers) What the fuck! \nINT. LINCOLN \nBrian opens the door to leave. \nEXT. GAS STATION \nEarly drags Carrie out of the office toward the car. Brian sees them running toward the car. They spill into the back seat. Brian sees Carrie is upset. \nBRIAN Carrie, what's wrong? (to Early) Early, we went through this already, you have to leave. \nFrom the back seat Early wipes some more feathers from his face, then points the Attendant's gun at Brian's head. \nEARLY (spits out a feather) 'Fraid not Bri'... Drive Adele. \nAdele starts the car. She pulls out of the station and into the rainstorm. \nBrian shakes his head. \nBRIAN None. \nON CARRIE \nIn quiet desperation, she raises her arm to her lips... and blows the solitary blood tinged reminder away. \nON BRIAN AND EARLY \nEarly stares at Brian. \nEARLY ...Well then, that's how many I killed. \nBRIAN (unconvincingly) If you say so. \nEARLY Damn right I do. \nON ADELE \nAdele watches the tiny down feather drift to the floor. \nON BRIAN AND EARLY \nEarly picks up a different container and gulps some down. After a moment... \nEARLY You never killed anyone have you Bri'? \nBrian shakes his head no. \nEARLY You never even seen anybody killed, right? \nBrian stops eating and looks at Early. \nBRIAN What are you getting at? \nEarly leans closer to him. \nEARLY You wanna tell me how'n the hell you gonna write a book 'bout somethin' you don't know nothin' 'bout? \nEye to eye, the two men stare at one another. Brian has no answer. \nEARLY Ya see what I'm sayin'? (beat) Ha! \nBRIAN (nervously mimes the same) ...Ha. \nEarly goes back to gulping down his dinner. This time he gets a spicy one. \nEARLY (a nod toward the carry out container) ...watch out for that stuff, it bites. \nBrian gazes at the cluster of Chinese carry-out food containers. An ironic reminder of an earlier conversation. He lets out a weak ironic laugh. \nBRIAN (recollecting to himself) ...way too much MSG. \nEXT. LINCOLN - TRAVELING - DAY \nINT. LINCOLN DRIVING DOWN BACKROADS - DAY \nEarly is behind the wheel, not a care in the world. Adele sits beside him playing with her camera. She turns and aims the camera at Brian and Carrie in the back seat, their hands are bound. \nADELE Smile. \nNeither makes any attempt at smiling. Adele snaps their photo anyway. In the front seat, she sits quietly for a moment then leans over to Early and whispers something to him. \nEARLY No way. I guarantee you he was breathing when I walked outta there. \nAdele sits back quietly. Carrie wants to speak but doesn't. \nEARLY Hey... Ain't we getting near the next murder site... Bri? \nBRIAN Forget about it, doesn't matter. \nEARLY Hell it don't... (beat) ...Hand me Brian's map there Adele. One day I'm gonna pass some store and see your book in the window. Me and Adele gonna buy a copy for our coffee table. \nNEW ANGLE \nCarrie silently fuming in the back seat. Brian stares at the rope that binds his wrists. \nEXT. OLD DESERTED MINE AREA - LATER THAT DAY \nThe Lincoln drives down the dirt access road and stops. They all get out, Early unties Brian and Carrie. \nEARLY Figured your hands might be starting to hurt. \nEarly looks down the hill to the old mine building. \nEARLY Let's have a look. You girls coming? \nCarrie's steely gaze answers Early's question. \nADELE Can I just wait here? \nEarly leans into the car and picks up Adele's camera. \nEARLY Don't worry Bri', I'll take the pictures. (to Adele, with a kiss to her cheek) ...you stay here with Carrie. (to Carrie) You run off... Bri' pays the price. Karma, remember? \nOf Early and Carrie as they are let into the house. \nINT. LINCOLN \nAdele is still rambling on about her interest in cacti. \nADELE ...There ain't nothin' can kill 'em. They can live for two even three hundred years. \nBRIAN Adele for god sake please lis... \nADELE (she glances over to Brian) There ain't nothing we could do. Once Early sets his mind on somethin', well thats the end of that. \nAdele drifts back to the cacti. \nINT. MUSGRAVE LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATER \nCLOSE ON A PORCELAIN CACTUS \nOne of many we now reveal to be atop a fireplace mantle. Adele leans in against the mantle and scrutinizes the cactus. \nCarrie and Brian sit on the floor, back to back, their arms bound around the leg of a piano by a pair of police handcuffs. Mrs. Musgrave is standing nearby. She's overwhelmed. Numb. She pours herself a glass of bourbon. \nMRS. MUSGRAVE (to herself) It's just like in that dream I had. If only I had seen their faces. \nShe takes her drink and sits down on the couch nearby. Adele drops down quietly on the chair next to her. \nADELE (tries to cheer Mrs. Musgrave up) You've got beautiful cactuses here, I just love 'em. My momma used to keep a garden. \nMrs. Musgrave downs most of her drink with the first try. Distressed, her head slumps down. \nEARLY (O.S.) (from the kitchen) Hey Bri... You ever stop to think that if you switched the two letters in your name... (entering the room) ...it would spell Brain. \nEarly, his pistol wedged in his belt, appears from the kitchen eating a sandwich. Between bites... He walks over and rips the phone out of the wall unit. He glimpses Mrs. Musgrave. \nEARLY What's wrong with her? \nADELE (sorry for her) She had a dream that somethin' like this was gonna happen. \nEarly notices the glass of bourbon in her trembling hands. He steps over to her and takes the glass away. \nEARLY I'll bet she did. \nHe sets the glass down next to a recent picture of Mrs. Musgrave and an ELDERLY MAN with silver hair. \nEARLY Where's your husband? \nMRS. MUSGRAVE (lying) ...I'm a widow. \nEarly looks at her, he doesn't believe her. \nEXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - NIGHT \nEverything is quiet beneath the star studded sky. The same elderly man pictured with Mrs. Musgrave is studying the sky through a powerful telescope. MR. MUSGRAVE is an amateur astronomer. o.s. the SOUND of a door opening. Then footsteps. \nMR. MUSGRAVE (excited) Is that you Peaches? Come, you must see Saturn tonight. The rings are sensational! \nINT. STUDY - GLASS DISPLAY CASE \nEarly leans into frame, staring at the display case. \nEARLY'S POV \nInside of it is a four foot long replica of the first ATOMIC BOMB, \"Fat Boy.\" Faded newspaper articles on the wall indicate Mr. Musgrave had something to do with the bomb's initial construction. An old photo on the bookshelf shows a much younger Mr. Musgrave in a '50's kitchen. He is laughing and embracing a '50's style female mannequin. \nMR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.) My oh my, this is quite rare, quite rare indeed. Come have a look... \nEarly's eyes drift over to a set of golf clubs that sit in the corner of the room. \nMR MUSGRAVE'S POV - THROUGH TELESCOPE \nThe planet Saturn and its glorious rings. \nMR. MUSGRAVE (O.S.) Peaches? \nOMITTED \nTHWACK!! The planet turns into a blur of light... then blackness. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME - ON BRIAN AND CARRIE \nBrian and Carrie are still cuffed to the piano, in the background we see Mrs. Musgrave and Adele looking out the window into the backyard. \nBRIAN (whispers to Carrie) You gotta talk to her. She looks up to you, she'll listen to you. \nCARRIE I tried talking to her at the mine. It didn't work. \nBRIAN Then try again, (it's our only chance.) \nEXT. HOUSE - LATER \nEarly is leaning on a golf club looking through the telescope. \nADELE (O.S.) Early? \nHe pulls his eye away as Adele arrives. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - SAME TIME (INTERCUT WITH PREVIOUS SCENE) \nBRIAN Carrie, watch for Early. \nCARRIE What are you going to do? \nBRIAN I'm going to try and lift the end of the piano. If I can... slide your cuffs free. \nCarrie glues her eyes to the kitchen doorway. Brian presses his back up under the belly of the piano and using all his strength manages to lift the piano an inch off the floor. Carrie slides her cuffs out from under the leg. \nCARRIE What about you? \nBRIAN I don't know. \nCarrie's eyes dart back toward the kitchen. Then she notices a chair nearby. \nCARRIE Can you lift it again? Just lift it, hurry. \nCarrie grabs the chair. As Brian lifts the piano, she pushes the chair beneath the underside of it. It holds the piano suspended an inch off the floor. Brian drops to the floor and slips the cuffs free. \nWhen... a solitary gunshot rings out from the cactus garden. \nA moment later, Early steps quietly into the room. He's pulling the last few cactus needles from his face. He sees Brian and Carrie standing. \nEARLY You two been busy in here. \nBRIAN What happened to Adele? \nEARLY Well, let's put it this way. (beat) I need me a new woman. \nA shocked silence. Brian and Carrie look to one another. Carrie moves toward the kitchen but Early stops her! Brian rushes at him. Early sticks the .45 automatic in his face! \nEARLY Sorry about this Bri... \nHe starts to squeeze the trigger. \nCARRIE (desperate) Early, don't. \nEarly stops. He looks to Carrie. \nCARRIE I'll do whatever you want. You want me to go with you, I'll go with you. Just don't kill him. \nEarly deliberates the situation, then eases up off the trigger... and smiles to Brian. \nThen, without warning, he hits Brian over the head with the butt of the .45 automatic. Brian falls to the floor unconscious. \nOMITTED \nEXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nAs Early finishes tieing one of the replicant bombs, Little Boy onto the hood. He reaches down and grabs a six pack of beer on the ground and shoves it in the back seat, then slides into the driver's seat next to an anxious Carrie. Carrie is now wearing one of Adele's floral dresses. \nEARLY Think anyone will notice? \nCarrie doesn't answer, Early laughs. \nINT. LINCOLN \nEarly looks out over the expanse of the desert. He sees a dirt fire road. \nEARLY I'll bet there's a 'door' out there... save us some time. \nCarrie doesn't understand what he means. Nonetheless, she nods her head in agreement. \nEXT. MUSGRAVE HOUSE \nThe Lincoln heads out, past the cactus garden, into the darkness. \nTHE LINCOLN'S HEADLIGHTS REVEAL \nAdele's lifeless body on the ground near her beloved cacti. \nFADE TO BLACK WITH THE DEPARTING HEADLIGHTS \nINT. MUSGRAVE LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nBrian is handcuffed on the floor. His eyes open slowly as he begins to regain consciousness. He senses someone behind him. He pivots around to see Mrs. Musgrave kneeling down to help him. \nEXT. DESERT - SAME TIME \nIn the distance, a cloud of dust reveals the Lincoln, traveling at high speed along the dirt fire road. \nINT. LINCOLN - SAME TIME \nEarly still behind the wheel. Carrie sits up against the passenger side door. She is tense and guarded. Out the window, nothing but empty desert. \nEARLY Pass me a beer hon'. \nCarrie quietly responds. She kneels on the front seat and reaches into the back. She grabs a bottle by its neck, and pulls it from the six pack of beer. Bottle in hand, she hesitates a moment... \nNEW ANGLE: EARLY'S POV IN THE DRIVING MIRROR \nEarly watches Carrie. \nEARLY You wanna hit me with that, huh? \nEarly is indifferent and looks around. About a hundred yards away, barely visible through the growing sand storm, an old 1950's style building. \nINT. LINCOLN \nEarly opens the back door. He grabs a box of supplies (some rope, a kerosene lamp etc.) \nEARLY Come on. \nCarrie slowly begins to respond. She slides across the front seat. \nNEW ANGLE: CLOSE ON THE INSTRUMENT PANEL \nCarrie's hand crosses frame and pulls out a knob on the dash. \nEXT. DESERT - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe sun is starting to set behind a distant mountain range. In the far distance... The pickup truck, revealed by its trail of dust, crosses the vast landscape. \nEXT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE \nEarly and Carrie struggle through the growing sand storm. Carrie throws a last curious glance back to the Lincoln as they reach the front door. \nINT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE \nThe front door is kicked open. Early enters the room with Carrie in tow. \nCLOSE ON EARLY \nHe looks around the room... A smile forms on his face. \nEARLY Howdy, my name's Early Grayce and this is my girl Carrie. I hope you don't mind us bargin' in like this but a... we was on our way to California when our car broke down, and... \nEARLY'S POV (AS HE EXPLAINS) \nA living room fully decorated in '50's furniture. Sand covers everything... Including... \nA FAMILY OF FOUR MANNEQUINS placed around the room: The father sits in front of the TV... The mother (the same mannequin as in Mr. Musgrave's old picture) is toppled over a kitchen counter... The little girl is seated at a table... The little boy is playing with his toy plane on the floor. \nEARLY (O.S.) Well... it's gettin' pretty rough out there, so if it's all the same to you, we'll be staying the night. \nEXT. '50'S HOUSE \nEarly slams the front door shut. \nCAMERA PULLS AWAY - REVEALING \nThe building is a single story '50's home of extremely cheap construction. It's in bad condition. \nEXT. DESERT - THE SMASHED WOODEN GATE \nThe last rays of the setting sun reveal the pickup truck heading toward the smashed remains of the wooden gate. The pickup truck hurtles through the opening left by the Lincoln. \nNEW ANGLE \nOn a collapsed old wooden sign. It lies on the ground a few feet away from the gate posts. \n\"DREAMLAND\" - NUCLEAR TEST RANGE DANGER - KEEP OUT \nINT. '50'S DESERT HOUSE - NIGHT \nWind and sand blow freely through the remains of the windows. A solitary kerosene lamp dimly illuminates the living room area. Its flickering light finds... Early, stripped to the waist, crouched over the broken TV set. He fidgets with the knobs. Then the mangled rabbit ears antenna. Carrie sits on some blankets in the corner next to the couch. She's scared to death. Her eyes scan the battered room. Debris everywhere. \nAmidst all of it, Carrie's erotic photographs have been placed about the room. \nON EARLY \nStill unable to get the TV to work, he smacks it a good one on the side. \nWith the smack!... Carrie whips her look back toward Early... To find he's lost interest in the TV. He turns toward Carrie. Stares at her for a moment. Then with a hint of a smile, he begins to move toward her. The time has arrived. \nHe reaches down, grabs her by the shirt and pulls her to her feet. Carrie doesn't resist. He's rough with her as he kisses her on the lips. Carrie pulls her mouth away from his. She seems confused, unsure of her feelings. Early watches her, until her eyes come back to his. Then she steps forward crowding her body against his, as she slips one hand around his neck and kisses him deep and hard... \nSuddenly Early breaks the kiss and backhands Carrie hard across the face. She lands on the floor several feet away, the palm of her right hand is bleeding. \nEarly looks down to his waist to find a large piece of glass protruding from his side. \nHe pulls the glass shard out, blood drips down his side and onto his jeans. \nCarrie gets up and races into the back bedroom, frantically looking for a way out, there is none. On the bed the two adult mannequins now lie naked. They have been placed, intertwined in a grotesque sexual position. \nCarrie turns and rushes back toward the door. Early intercepts her and throws a punch to her stomach, which doubles her over. Then Early sends a second punch to her face, she stumbles backward, landing onto the bed amongst the mannequins. Early begins undoing his belt. \nEARLY (friendly) You'll like it... \nA violent gust of wind sends several of the erotic photos swirling through the air. One of the photos whips across Early's chest. The wind holds it there momentarily. \nEARLY Not a lot, but you'll like it. \nEarly peels Carrie's photo off him, the blood from his wound covers the back of it. He slaps it against the nearest wall. It sticks. He walks toward her. \nINT. PICKUP TRUCK - BRIAN'S POV \nThe high winds have turned into a full fledged sandstorm. Brian is still driving dangerously fast. The dim lights of the old pickup illuminate only a short stretch of dirt road ahead and the swirling sand. \nHe passes a road sign: 'DEVASTATION DRIVE' \n", "test1_input": "BRIAN Dead. \nKIM (O.S.) (sarcastic) Obviously! \nNEW ANGLE \nA small party in progress. Graduate student types, smoking, drinking. The usual. Carrie and Brian stand out in this group, their look is more stylized, their attitude less complacent. Carrie, in particular, looks restless. \nCARL Man or woman? \nBRIAN Man. \nCarrie tunes in and pays attention to the game. \nCLAUDIA Real or fictional. \nBRIAN Real. \nCARRIE Ted Bundy. \nBrian's eyes dart to Carrie. The look on his face tells everyone she nailed it. Brian gets up to get another drink. Several people laugh, amazed that Carrie knows Brian so well. \nCLAUDIA What a guess! \nCARL Doesn't count, she's disqualified. \nCARRIE Why? \nCARL Because you've been living with him, and his thesis for the last year and a half. (beat) He's probably been researching Ted Bundy all week. \nPETER Carl, you are the world's worst loser! \nCarl looks over to Carrie. She gives him the finger and a cheeky smile. \nCAROL, sitting next to Carrie, asks... \nCAROL Any word from that gallery? \nCARRIE Not yet. \nCAROL Nervous? \nCARRIE ...Apprehensive. Let's not forget these are the people who banned the Mapplethorpe show. Anyway, California's loaded with galleries. \nCAROL (nods toward Brian) You mean 'Ted Bundy's' finally agreed to leave? \nCarrie watches Brian disappear into another room. \nCARRIE ...Soon as he finishes his thesis. \nCAROL Listen, Eric's been \"finishing\" his for over three years now. \nCarrie lights a cigarette. Her frustration is showing. \nCARRIE Yeah, well Brian's got 'til the end of the summer, then I'm outta here. \nShe gets up and begins weaving her way through the crowded room. Carol follows. \nCAROL I'm sorry, but I just can't see you veggin' out in LA-LA LAND. \nCARRIE Oh, I don't know... I think that once I dye my hair blonde, buy a string bikini and cultivate that tan... I could be veggin' out with the best of 'em... (does a valley- girl/beach bunny) Like fer shurr! \nCarrie and Carol share a strained laugh. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nINT. APARTMENT KITCHEN - FEW MOMENTS LATER \nThe room's crowded with people. There's a lot of noise -- \"shop talk,\" banter. Clipped conversations overlap, as we find Brian with his friend Eric. They are in the midst of making a blender of margaritas. \nBRIAN I'm talking about the mind and culpability of a serial killer. Someone who has no ability to distinguish between right and wrong should not be imprisoned, let alone executed. \nEric dumps in a handful of ice cubes as Brian pours in the booze. \nERIC Oh, here we go again. Let's just lay it all at the altar of misfiring synapses, amok biochemicals and horrendous childhoods. \nBRIAN Look, it's a fact, most of these people suffer from a severe chemical brain imbalance. (beat) That enough Tequila? \nERIC Probably not... \nBrian pours in the rest of the bottle. \nBRIAN (to Eric) The answer is research and treatment under hospital supervised conditions, not the electric chair! \nEric looks for triple sec in the cupboards. PETER overhears them on his way to the refrigerator. \nPETER Yeah, until it's your mother's head they find in the refrigerator. \nHe pulls open the refrigerator door and grabs two beers. Carrie steps up behind Brian. \nBRIAN Executing the killer wouldn't bring my mother back. \nCARRIE Thank god! \n", "test1_true": "BRIAN (sarcastic to Carrie) Ha, ha. \nERIC Yeah, but it'd sure make you feel better, wouldn't it? \nBRIAN No, it wouldn't make me feel better. \nPeter finds triple sec in the refrigerator. \nPETER ...Looking for this? \nEric takes the triple sec from Peter and pours some in the blender. He turns it on. It whines. \nCARRIE (to Brian) If I have to listen to one more \"tweed\" talk about his dissertation, I'm going to throw up. \nERIC (to Brian) Label it anyway you want, the bottom line is these people are evil, plain and simple. \nBRIAN (continuing with Eric) Okay, now you want to talk about good versus evil? Well then let's start with Adam and Eve and the snake. \nCARRIE Who do I have to blow to get out of here? \nBRIAN (reconsiders) A... I gotta go. \nEXT. LUCKY STREET GRILL \nA relic from the fifties with large glass windows. The rain has stopped but the streets are still wet. Early's piece of shit Grand Prix pulls into the lot. He gets out and walks into the diner. \nINT. DINER - NIGHT \nThe place is almost empty. Early, still wet from the rain, walks to the counter and sits down. He calls out to the kitchen. \nEARLY Coffee and a bowl of chili, please. \nWAITRESS (O.S.) ...Be right there. \nThe only other customer is an OLD MAN, sitting at the counter nearby nursing a cup of coffee. His face half hidden under a rain soaked hat. Early selects a tune from the countertop juke box. \nOLD MAN'S POV \nOut of the corner of his eye he sees a bug (from the concrete block) crawl out of Early's sleeve and onto the counter. \nOLD MAN (from beneath his shadowy brim...) The Antichrist'll be a woman, in a man's body. Seven heads and seven tails. \nEarly gazes at the Old Man curiously, then calls out to the waitress... \nEARLY Make that to go. \nEarly notices the small bug crawling across the counter. He leans closer to it and watches it. After a moment, he THWACKS it off the counter with his thumb and finger. The bug lands on the hot iron griddle with a SIZZLE! \nEARLY glances at the Old Man again... then scoots over one stool closer to him. Early seems curious to want to get a glimpse under the brim of the Old Man's hat. \nIN THE BACK KITCHEN AREA \nThe waitress is bagging Early's order to go... when the front door slams shut! \nFRONT DINING AREA \nThe waitress re-enters the room. It's empty. Neither the Old Man nor Early are there. With Early's food in hand, she makes her way along the rear of the counter toward the front door. She glances around curiously. On the griddle, the remains of something black and charred smoulders. Closer to the entrance, she stares at the front door. The sign that hangs in its window has been turned... the backside which faces her reads \"OPEN.\" \nAT THE FRONT DOOR \nShe wonders about the sign for a moment, then stares curiously out the window... not a soul in sight. She locks the door and begins closing up for the night. She turns to make her way to the rear of the diner then notices something. Slowly she moves along the side wall, past a number of highbacked booths. \nHER POV \nSitting on one of the funky old leather seats in a booth are a pair of RED HIGH HEELED SHOES (the same pair worn earlier by the Pretty Teenage Girl). The Waitress glances nervously about the interior. No one in sight. \nAT THE BOOTH \nShe reaches down slowly and picks up the pair of shoes. Looks at them closely. Stares at the inside lining. Then suddenly out of the quiet... a voice. \nEARLY ...Size 6. \nThe Waitress spins a startled look to the booth beyond hers! Early leans out from behind the highback partition. \nEARLY That's right ain't it, size 6? \nThe Waitress... smiles, nods shyly. \nEARLY Happy birthday Adele. \nADELE Early, you are so sweet. \nThis is ADELE CORNERS. She's 17, pretty, uneducated and Early's girlfriend. She steps over to him, gives him a kiss, then sits down on the seat across from him. She starts to try on her new shoes. \nADELE I feel kind of like the wizard of oz, you know when she gets the red shoes. \nEARLY Well Dorothy, why don't you hand me that chili there. \nShe passes the bag to Early. He digs in. Between bites, he glances over to Adele who's enthusiastically pulling on the new shoes. \nINT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S LOFT APARTMENT - LATER THAT NIGHT \nA door swings open spilling light into a darkened room. Brian and Carrie, a little drunk, return home from the party. \nTheir apartment is in an old converted industrial building in a funky low rent part of town. \n", "test1_id": 2640, "test2_input": "BRIAN (sarcastically) Of course! The accent, the clothes, and those table manners!... He's got to be a mass murderer! (pause) What else could he be? \nHe switches off the bathroom light, steps out of the doorway, and begins to pull his jeans off. Carrie climbs into bed. \nBRIAN You know, it wouldn't even surprise me if he turned out to be... a Republican! \nBrian tosses his jeans and moves toward the bed. Carrie switches off the the only light in the room. In the dark, we hear a thud as Brian trips over a chair. \nBRIAN Goddamnit!... my fucking toe! \nEXT. BRIAN AND CARRIE'S MOTEL ROOM - A MOMENT LATER \nCarrie leaves the motel room, ice bucket in hand. \nCARRIE (to Brian inside room) Try not to lose consciousness 'til I get back. \nEXT. MOTEL CORRIDOR \nAt the far end of a narrow hallway, Carrie finds an ice machine rumbling away noisily. The only illumination, a single fluorescent light bulb, hangs suspended above it. \nAT THE ICE MACHINE \nWith her arm buried inside the ice machine, Carrie scavenges for what little ice there is... when, out of the corner of her eye, she notices... \nSOMEONE standing at the other end of the corridor. The silhouette of a man. \nCarrie stops. Her eyes scan the claustrophobic hallway for another way out. There is none. \nShe tries to ignore the situation. Grabs another handful of ice cubes. The man approaches. Carrie stops again. Her mind races. The man's face slowly becomes visible as he nears the fluorescent light. It's Early. \nEARLY Ain't you done enough drinking for tonight? \nCARRIE ...Brian hurt his foot. \nEarly reaches past her into the ice machine and grabs a solitary cube. He puts it in his mouth, sucks on it. His torso is drenched in sweat. He catches Carrie staring at him. \nEARLY Sometimes... Don't know why it is... I get so hot I can't stand it. I just start sweating like a dog. You ever get like that? \nCARRIE (tenuous) No. \nEarly spits the ice cube back into his hand. He presses it against the back of his neck. \nEARLY I can feel it start to run down my neck... (he turns his back to show her) ...and down my back... right into my pants. \nCarrie follows a bead of ice water as it slides down between his shoulder blades and along his back. \nEARLY ...and everything starts stickin' together... keeps running down the back of my legs like two rivers racin' for my boots, see who gets there first. \nHe snaps a look back to Carrie and finds her looking at his ass. She diverts her glance. \nEARLY You never get that hot, huh? \nCarrie shakes her head no. Early looks in his hand to see that his ice cube has melted. \nCARRIE I gotta get back before this ice melts. \nCarrie tries to slip past him. He reaches back into the machine, momentarily blocking her exit. He grabs another ice cube. His face only inches from hers. \nEARLY ...never? \nCARRIE No, never. Excuse me. \nHe pops the ice cube in his mouth and lets her pass. \nEARLY You like Skynard? \nNo response, Early chews up the ice cube. \nOMITTED \nSequence omitted from original script. \nEXT. LINCOLN LEAVING THE MOTEL - NEXT MORNING \nThe car crawls out of the parking lot. \nINT. LINCOLN \nCarrie is driving. Brian is contending with a major hangover. There is still a silent tension between Brian and Carrie from the argument the night before. Early is in the back with Adele. Brian moves his head and moans. \nADELE My daddy always took sauerkraut juice and tobasco sauce for a hangover, mixed in one egg not two, and some tomato juice... \nFrom the front seat, Brian's hand springs up in a desperate plea for an end to Adele's colorful description. \nBRIAN I'm okay, thanks. \nBrian rolls down his window for some fresh air, as the car pulls away. \nEXT. LINCOLN ON HIGHWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nTHE CAR IS HEADING DOWN A COUNTRY ROAD. \nINT. LINCOLN \nCarrie glances over at Brian, who is now asleep next to her. She looks up into her rear-view mirror... \n", "test2_true": "Early is asleep, leaning against the door. Adele is rummaging through a large canvas bag on the seat next to her. Suddenly... The wail of an approaching ambulance gets Carrie's attention. It roars by. Carrie glances in the mirror again. The next instant, unexpectedly... \nEXT. LINCOLN \nShe furiously pulls the car off the road to an abrupt halt. \nINT. LINCOLN \nBrian's heads bangs against the side window. \nBRIAN What! What! \nCarrie nods toward the back seat. Brian turns and sees Adele looking back at them questioningly. Beside her, Early rustles. \nBRIAN What is it? \nCARRIE Look again! \nBrian notices that Adele's rummaging has revealed an automatic pistol in the open canvas bag. Brian stares at it. Early's eyes open. \nEXT. PARKED LINCOLN - LATER \nA deserted plain. It's very quiet here. Until the silence is broken by the sound of gunshots. Reveal Early teaching Brian how to shoot. A row of tin cans are set up on a rusty old car. It's obvious that Brian's enthralled with the idea of shooting the gun. Even if he isn't hitting anything. \nEARLY Only thing my old man ever gave me is that goddamn .45. \nBrian fires off another shot, misses again. \nEARLY Bri', you're jerkin' it when you pull the trigger, hold it real steady. \nNearby stands an unhappy Carrie. Adele pulls her yoyo out of her pocket. \nADELE Boys'll be boys. \nCarrie doesn't respond. Adele offers the yoyo to Carrie. \nADELE You know any tricks? \nCarrie shakes her head no. Adele withdraws her offer. \nADELE You wanna learn some? \nAgain Carrie declines. Her steely gaze returns to Brian. \nON EARLY AND BRIAN \nEarly helps Brian to hold the gun. \nEARLY Steady... Breath in... now let half of it out, and... fire. \nBANG!! The can flies off the tree stump. Brian turns to Carrie to see her reaction... but she's already on her way back to the car, and she's furious. Concerned, Brian starts to follow after her... But Early grabs his attention. \nEARLY Bri, I want you to keep this gun... consider it a present. Never know, California could turn out to be a dangerous place. \nBrian gazes at the gun resting in the palm of his hand. \nEXT. AN EMPTY HIGHWAY - DAY \nThe Lincoln rolling along. \nINT. LINCOLN \nBrian is driving. Carrie keeps to herself. In her side mirror she catches a glimpse of Early curled up in Adele's lap. She watches a moment longer... and realizes that they are making out. Beginning to kiss and touch one another. \nEXT. HIGHWAY NEAR ABATTOIR - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe Lincoln turns off the main highway onto a dirt road. In the distance, we see a large rundown building. \nINT. AN OLD DESERTED ABATTOIR - AFTERNOON \nThe Lincoln pulls up to the ramshackle structure. Brian glances to the back seat to make a remark to Early and Adele and sees that they are amorously engaged. \nBrian and Carrie start to gather their stuff. Carrie opens the glove compartment, inside are boxes of film... and the .45 automatic. She takes a few packs of film, and closes the glove compartment. \nEARLY Tell ya Bri., I'm still a little sleepy,... think Adele and me are gonna take us a fiesta. \nCARRIE (pissed off) Siesta. \nCarrie reaches over and takes the keys from the ignition, locks the glove compartment and pockets the key. Both she and Brian exit the car. As they start to walk toward the structure Brian hears a sound, he turns back to see. Adele leaning forward into the frontseat as the lincoln's big white top starts to come up. \nINT. ABATTOIR \nEven in daylight, the interior of the dilapidated old building is equal parts unnerving, austere, and menacing. The last rays of sunlight stream through what remains of the windows. The light falls on a long ominous row of wicked looking meat- hooks hanging from the ceiling. \nCarrie is getting her camera equipment ready. She's quiet and uncommunicative. \nNEW ANGLE \nCLOSE, on a small audio cassette player as it comes to rest on a giant butcher block table in the center of the room. Brian pops a cassette in the player. \nCARRIE What's that? \nBRIAN A copy of a tape they found. He recorded everything. \nCamera in hand, Carrie begins to move about, despite the fact that this place repels her. \n", "test2_id": 2641, "test3_input": "EARLY You want to know about my daddy, I'll tell you about my daddy, Bri... \nEXT. LINCOLN \nCarrie walks over to Adele at the car. Adele doesn't miss a beat with her yoyo. \nCARRIE Adele, listen to me... Early's sick; he should be in a hospital. \nAdele screws up the trick. She pulls the yoyo off her finger and throws it in the back seat. She leans into the front seat and cranks the radio up to the max. Closing her eyes, she begins moving to the music, and tries to ignore Carrie. \nCARRIE (shouting over the music) The police are after him, he's a murderer! \nADELE (uncertain) ...That's not true. \nCARRIE (shouting) What? \nADELE (shouting back) That's not true! \nNEW ANGLE \nA POLICE CAR pulls into frame, unnoticed by Carrie and Adele in the background. \nINT. POLICE CAR \nMALE OFFICER Let's take a look. \nFEMALE OFFICER I'll call in the plate. \nThe Male Officer exits, unlocking his holster. The Female Officer picks up the police radio and calls in the license plate number. \nEXT. LINCOLN NEAR MINE AREA \nThe radio is blaring. Adele continues to dance despite Carrie's pleas. \nCARRIE (shouting) ...I wouldn't lie to you, Adele. . . I saw him kill that man. \nADELE (defensive) Early didn't kill nobody, he wouldn't do that. I don't know why you're saying those things. You ain't my friend. \nWith that, Adele stops her dancing and turns away from Carrie... To see the Male Officer walking toward them. \nADELE Please don't say anything Carrie. \nThe Male Officer continues toward them. It looks like he's talking to them... but his voice is inaudible under the deafening radio. \nNEW ANGLE: FAVORING THE TWO POLICE OFFICERS \nThe Female Officer sticks her head out of the police car and yells to her partner. He turns to listen. \nFEMALE OFFICER We got a match, I'll call for back up. \nAs the Male Officer turns back, he sees Adele reach into the front seat of the Lincoln. The Male Officer draws his revolver and levels it at Adele. \nNEW ANGLE: FAVORING ADELE AND CARRIE \nClick! Adele shuts the radio off, total silence. As Adele leans back out of the car, she turns, facing directly into the barrel of the Male Officer's gun. \nMALE OFFICER All right ladies, I want both of you to slowly step away from the ca... \nBANG! A single gunshot rings out! The Male Officer jerks back and falls to the ground. Adele screams! Carrie whips a panicked glance around and sees... Early running toward them. Brian, bewildered, follows behind. \nBRIAN'S POV (RUNNING) \nAhead of him, he watches Early race past the wounded Male Officer. He kicks the Officer's revolver out of reach and rushes toward the police car. \nEarly fires his gun repeatedly as he charges the car! \nThe Female Officer pulls her gun and starts to get out of the car, when... a shot shatters the windshield hitting her in the chest. She collapses back onto the seat. \nON BRIAN \nHe stops at the sight of the wounded Male Officer. Shocked, he watches the man writhing in pain. His hands clutching his crotch. His blood oozes into the dirt. \nEarly approaches the police car. He sees the dead cop and hears the radio dispatcher. \nPOLICE RADIO Officer needs help, shots fired, six Adam five, one eighty-seven, suspects wanted in multiple murders. Location unknown, last seen... \nBrian is not sure what to do. He looks around... sees the Officer's handgun lying in the dirt. He takes a step toward it, when... another gunshot rings out! Brian stops. Looks to the police car. He sees Early standing there, smoke belching from the dashboard... the police radio is dead. \nEarly walks back toward Brian and the others. He steps over to the injured Male Officer on the ground. \nEARLY Tell me that don't hurt. \nEarly picks up the wounded cop's gun. He hands it to Brian as he trains the .45 automatic at Brian's chest. \nEARLY Shoot him. You'll be doing him a favor. \nBrian looks to Early in disbelief. \nOMITTED \nBRIAN No, no, I can't. \nEarly cocks the pistol and pushes the barrel to Brian's head. Brian looks down at the wounded cop who is writhing in pain. \nEARLY (No,) It's the answer to all them questions of yers. \n", "test3_true": "EARLY Now you'll never know. \nEarly cocks his pistol. \nBRIAN ...Don't do it. Early, look at him, look at his face. That's not your father. \nEarly stares at the wounded cop's face. \nEARLY I know that. That there is a policeman in a world of pain. And this is what you call a mercy killin'. \nEarly shoots the cop again. The cop lays still. \nEarly reaches down and takes the dead cop's handcuffs. He casually points the little camera at the dead cop. Flash!! \nEXT. LINCOLN - ON BACKROADS - LATER \nThe Lincoln hurtles down the road. \nINT. LINCOLN \nEarly driving. Adele in the passenger seat looks bewildered. Carrie and Brian in back, handcuffed, eyes hollow with exhaustion and fear. Then out of the quiet... \nEARLY I'm still waiting. \nAdele looks across the seat to Early. Her face drained of all expression. \nEARLY (disappointed) Not so much as a simple \"thank you.\" \nAdele at a loss. Finally... confused... \nADELE (empty) ...thank you. \nEARLY Thank you for what? (becoming aggravated) What are you thanking me for Adele? \nADELE (hesitantly, she admits) ...I don't know. \nEARLY Well Adele... it was for... (screaming at her) ...saving your fucking life back there! \nShe shrinks away from him. \nEARLY (gesturing with his fingertips a fraction apart) Darlin' you were 'bout that far from spendin' the night at the morgue. You understand? \nCARRIE He wasn't going to shoot her, you murdering son of a bitch! \nEarly looks into the rear-view mirror. Brian tries to defuse the situation. \nBRIAN Carrie... stop it. \nCARRIE (explodes) What the fuck is wrong with you Brian!? If you'll stop taking notes for once and open your eyes... you'll see that he is a homicidal fucking killer. He is... for real! \nBRIAN Shut up Carrie, please... just shut up! \nEXT.

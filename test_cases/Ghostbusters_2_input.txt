CLOSER ANGLE 
Peter and Winston stop, look at Ray in disbelief. 
WINSTON A werechicken? 
PETER Get serious, Ray. 
RAY Then explain those! 
Ray points at ground.  Peter, Winston and Slimer look down. 
THEIR POV 
Peter is standing with both feet in two enormous chicken footprints. 
SMASH CUT TO: 
EXT. -- OPEN FIELD -- NIGHT 
The three Ghostbusters follow Maude's "chicken" tracks with powerful flashlights across a field spotted with haystacks.  Slimer moves ahead, nose to ground like a bloodhound. 
SLIMER (SNIFFS as he goes) 
ANGLE ON SLIMER 
He floats along above the flashlight-illuminated tracks which lead him right into the haystack.  We hear a BONK from within, then: 
SLIMER (VO) Ow! 
Slimer backs OUT INTO SHOT rubbing his head.  He looks up and his eyes pop wide. 
SLIMER (amazed GASP!)

MAX Nothin wrong with that. 
Jackie's smile grows bigger. 
MAX (CONT'D) Does something else worry you? 
JACKIE I just feel like I'm always starting over. You said how many bonds you wrote? 
MAX Fifteen thousand. 
JACKIE Well, I've flown seven million miles. And I've been waitin' on people almost twenty years. The best job I could get after my bust was Cabo Air, which is about the worst job you can get in this industry. I make about sixteen thousand, with retirement benefits , ain't worth a damn. And now with this arrest hanging over my head, I'm scared. If I lose my job I gotta start all over again, but I got nothin to start over with. I'll be stuck with whatever I can get. And that scares me more than Ordell. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY 
A.T.F. man, Ray Nicolet, moves down the hallway of the big building... ten heads for the office of Mark Dargus. 
He reaches the closed door... raps on it. 
DARGUS (O.S.) Come in. 
Nicolet opens the door, revealing Dargus and Jackie Brown sitting in the office talking. 
DARGUS (CONT'D) Great, you're here. 
NICOLET Hey, Jackie. 
Jackie waves. 
Dargus stands up and says to Jackie; 
DARGUS Let me have a word outside with Agent Nicolet for a moment? 
JACKIE Take your time. 
DARGUS Thanks. 
NICOLET Well just be a minute. 
JACKIE Can I smoke? 
DARGUS Go ahead. 
The two detectives step outside and close the door on Jackie as she pulls out her cigarettes. 
NICOLET What's going on? 
DARGUS She wants to make a deal. 
NICOLET She sound scared? 
DARGUS She almost sounds scared. 
NICOLET What's she want? 
DARGUS She wants to go back to work. 
NICOLET What's she willing to give us? 
DARGUS She hasn't one into specifics yet, she's been waiting for you. 
NICOLET She knows it's my case? 
DARGUS She ain't said it, but she's not stupid, she knows it's you who wants her. 
CLOSEUP JACKIE 
Inside Dargus' office, smoking a Mild Seven. 
Dargus and Nicolet come back inside. 
NICOLET Thanks for waiting, Jackie. Now tell me, what can we do for you? 
JACKIE I need permission to leave the country so I keep my job. 
NICOLET We can look into that. 
JACKIE I need it tomorrow. If I don't show up for work tomorrow, I'm fired. 
NICOLET You know what we want. 
JACKIE If I'm working, I can help you. 
DARGUS Help us do what? 
JACKIE Help you get Ordell Robbie. 
NICOLET Oh, so now you know him? 
JACKIE You never asked me if I did or not. 
DARGUS But now you're telling us now you do. 
JACKIE 'Course I do - I deliver money for him. 
NICOLET No shit. You know how he makes hi money? 
JACKIE He sells guns. 
NICOLET You ever see him sell guns? 
JACKIE No. 
NICOLET Then how do you know he sells guns? 
JACKIE He told me. Besides, why else would an A.T.F. man be after him? 
NICOLET How can you help us? 
JACKIE Short of wearing a wire, I'll do everything I can to help you throw his ass in jail. And in exchange for my help, I need permission to leave the country and immunity. 
DARGUS You don't want much, do you? 
JACKIE Can you do it or not? 
The two cops look at each other. 
DARGUS (to Nicolet) It's your call. 
Nicolet looks at Jackie. 
NICOLE It's possible.

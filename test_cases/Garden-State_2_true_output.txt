LARGE (snapping out of it) Oh, who's up? They all laugh. She gets up and slowly walks over to the couch. She smiles nervously. Large stares at her. we see in his eyes he's feeling more fucked up every instant. She stands above him at the couch, then straddles him with her knees on either side of his legs; sitting on his lap. The MUSIC PLAYS. Everyone is speechless. she slowly leans in. Eye contact. They kiss softly enjoying every second. Its incredibly sexy. 
HIS FINGERS CLUTCH HER THIGH They stop and look at each other. She kisses him on the cheek and gets up. Everyone reacts and some clap. 
JESSE This is gonna be a good night. Everything SPEEDS-UP and SLOWS DOWN. A barrage of images: people hooking up, girls kissing girls, guys feeling girls up, joints being passed, one girl crying, Mark showing off his golf swing, Large trying to take deep breaths, Jesse and Dave hugging, two-figures moving quickly under a blanket. Kenny in full riot gear letting people take turns hitting him in his helmet. FASTER : hands gripping each other, a nose on a neck, hands gripping a waist. Ecu s Largos face as his eyes swim in their eocketo s end the corners of his mouth lift with the idea of a smile.. 
The motion of the room is sped to a blur until finally: 
BLACKNESS. A BLARING LIGHT comes out of the darkness. Morning sun streams through a window revealing Large's face, full frame, eyes still closed. Across his forehead in thick black marker the word "BALLS" is written. His eyes open wide. He has no idea where he is. His eyeballs swing left, then right. As Large site up THE CAMERA pulls back to reveal we are 
INT. MARK'S LIVING ROOM -- MORNING 
Large site on the sofa covered in an afghan. White morning sunlight pries past the beach towels covering the windows to highlight the duet in the air. A NOISE in the kitchen pops Large' s eyes open. He has no idea where he is. Large's POV into the kitchen reveals limited glimpses of a person walking around; like a hunter's amateur video of his Bigfoot sighting. He can only make out pieces: a sword, boots, then a cereal box. Then quickly the figure turns into perfect view: a medieval Knight in full regalia. They make eye contact for a second and Large slams his eyes shut. When he opens them again the knight is gone. 
INT. KITCHEN -- LATER 
Large and Mark sit with CAROL, mark's mother and TIN PAYTON, 25. Carol is mid-forties and always looks like she's got a cold or has just been crying. Tim is dressed as a Medieval Knight. Large and mark stare at Tim as he SLURPS down his cereal. Carol smokes a thin cigarette. Mark is shirtless. No one addresses the fact that it says "Balls" in black marker On Large's forehead. Silence but for the CLANKING of SILVERWARE and TIM'S 
SLURPING. 
CAROL it's good isn't it. No one responds, so Tim nods to be nice. 
CAROL (CONT'D) i always try to save a couple of marshmallows for the very end, but I can never make it. 
(MORE) 
2B My mind wanders and I'm left with flakes and pink milk. And yet each time I pour a bowl I tell myself that this time, this is gonna be the time I'm gonna save at least one. 
LARGE So, Tim, how long you been working at medieval Times? 
TIM Three years. But I've only been a knight for two. You have to pay your dues. I worked in the stables and helped in the kitchen. 
CAROL When I started he was making the coleslaw. It hasn't been the same since you got knighted. 
TIM I really just stirred it. 
CAROL Don't be modest. Mr. Modesty won the joust last night. 
LARGE Congratulations. 
TIM It's not that big a deal, it's fixed. 
LARGE What was it that happened to you in high school? You had a thing, but I forgot what it was. 
MARK He got the shit kicked out of him. 
CAROL No he didn't. 
MARK How do you know? He got the shit kicked out of him by Tyrell Freedmen. 
LARGE I remember that. That was sofucked up. Why did he do that? 
TIM I fucked him up too. 
MARK He knocked your teeth out. 
TIM He said I bit off him 'cause I got the same Jordans. 
CAROL What? 
LARGE That's right. 
CAROL Who? 
TIM Tyrell said I bit off him 'cause I got the same Jordans he did. But his were the red ones and mine were all white. 
MARX Yours were red too by the time he was done with you. Everybody laughs but Tim. 
MARK (CONT'D) Air bloody tooth. 
(BEAT) So what are those, like fake teeth you got now? 
TIM He only chipped one tooth. So what are you up to now, Mark, digging graves? Silence. A SPOON CLANKS on a plate. 
CAROL Mark's getting into real estate. Silence. Mark FLICKS open his Zippo lighter and lights a cigarette. 
CAROL (CONT'D) Tim can speak Klingon.

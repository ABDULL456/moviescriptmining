Suddenly from another corner of the room, a light comes on, revealing the puppet from the video in the corner. Amanda sees it, staring at it wide eyed, her sobs softening for a moment as she stares at it. Slowly, it wheels towards her on a tricycle. She can only stare and cry, not sure what to do or expect. It stops, leering at her, then speaks. 
JIGSAW Congratulations. You are still alive. Most people are so ungrateful to be alive. But not you. Not anymore. 
Cut back into a close up of Amanda in the interrogation room, her head still shaking a bit, almost like a series of slight spasms. She continues to sniffle, her eyes far off. Cut to Tapp. 
TAPP You are, in fact, a drug addict. Isnt that right, Mandy? (she nods, but doesnt look up.) Do you think that is why he picked you? (She lets out a sob, briefly nodding once.) Are you grateful, Mandy? 
She finally raises her head, looking into his eyes for the first time. 
AMANDA (softly) He...helped me. 
As she starts sniffling and breathing more heavily, Tapp looks over his shoulder into Lawrences room, right in his direction. He may not see him, but he knows hes there. The camera then cuts back to Amanda, who starts sobbing more heavily again. Slowly, the camera moves down into and under the table, fading back into an overhead view of the bathroom where Lawrence and Adam are. 
Adam sits in his corner, staring down at the floor as he has been listening to Lawrences story. He looks up across to Lawrence. 
ADAM (softly) Are you sure its him? 
LAWRENCE (nods slightly) Yeah, Im sure. 
ADAM (becoming a little hysterical again. He speaks accusingly) How do I know youre telling the truth? You can be the one who put me in this room! (he gesticulates as he speaks, pointing to Lawrence and himself.) 
LAWRENCE (internal eye roll, speaks slowly, as to a simpleton) Im in exactly the same situation youre in. 
ADAM Wrong. (he stands up, kicking his chained foot out. Shouts.) Wrong! Youve got one thing I dont: Information! (He hovers as close as he can in a threatening pose, pointing) You know who did this! (He picks up a glass shard that fell when he broke the mirror, holds it up threateningly to Lawrence) Now you either tell me what is really going on (Lawrence rolls his eyes, turns his head over to his left, away from Adam) or Ill cut you with this, you hear me? Ill cut- (But he stops short as he sees something in the glass. He flips it over, studying it, flips it back. He looks over to the mirror on the wall, studying it, thinking.) 
Lawrence notices that Adams ranting has ended, glances over at him. 
LAWRENCE What? 
ADAM (looks over at Lawrence, then back at the mirror.) Its a two-way mirror. 
Adam drops the shard down on the floor carefully, then reaches over to the corner behind him, leaning down and picking up a loose padlock. He lifts it up and throws it as hard as he can against the mirror, shattering most of the glass. Lawrence briefly startles at the sound and force of the glass shattering. Adam reaches back down, finds another piece of debris and throws that at the mirror with just as much force. The rest of the glass breaks away, and a camera with a red light can bee seen behind a clear glass. Lawrence stands up to get a better look at it. We movie in closer to the camera, getting a better look at it as well. 
Suddenly there is a flash of static and we find ourselves looking at a fuzzy, black and white surveillance video of Lawrence and Adam in the bathroom, staring right at us into the camera. The shot pulls back a bit and we see that the video is on a silver surveillance monitor. A partial view of other recording-type equipment can be seen on either side of the monitor. A mans voice speaks, though it doesnt sound quite the same as on the Jigsaw tapes. As he speaks, a hand wearing a black leather glove raises up slightly and waves its fingers at the screen. 
MAN (OS, Taunting) I can see you...

{"train": "\"BAD SANTA\" \nby \nGlenn Ficarra & John Requa \nRevisions by \nEthan Coen & Joel Coen \nPolish by \nTerry Zwigoff \nDimension Films \nProduction Draft - WHITE February 1, 2002 \nFADE IN: \nSnow flakes falling against a black sky. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS THEM DOWNWARD TO REVEAL \nEXT. MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT \nIt looks like a warm cozy place out of \"It's A Wonderful Life\". The window is flocked with fake snow, and hung with colorful Christmas lights, wreaths and ornaments. \nCAMERA PUSHES SLOWLY IN \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT \nCAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT IN SAME DIRECTION \nTITLES BEGIN \nThe barman, wiping down the counter, gives an occasional semi-furtive glance toward the far end of the bar. \nOther patrons chat near the bartender and also give occasional glances toward the far end of the bar. It is early evening -- happy hour -- and the clientele is well-heeled and sociable. \nA customer says something interrogative to the bartender, who looks down the bar and shrugs. \nREVERSE - CAMERA CONTINUES MOVEMENT (Notes the combination of the HIGH ANGLE and the tilt of Santa's head keep his face from being clearly revealed in this scene). \nSitting alone at the far end of the bar, given a wide berth by the other customers, a man (WILLIE) stares morosely into his drink. The drink is clearly not his first. \nHe wears a red velvet suit and red velvet hat with a white pom-pom. He has shiny black boots with red velvet trim. His long white beard is not real and is in fact pulled down below his chin to facilitate drinking. It exposes heavy black stubble. \nSwaying slightly, he raises the drink to the vicinity of his lips. Once it gets close he must navigate it in with some effortful coordination. He takes a sip and sets the drink carefully back down. \nAfter another long, staring, morose beat, he starts weeping. \nIt is loud, dolorous, and unself-conscious. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY BEHIND THE MILWAUKEE BAR - NIGHT \nSanta staggers out the back door... \nCAMERA FOLLOWS BEHIND HIM still hiding his face. \nSanta gets about ten feet, then pauses and leans with one hand against the alley wall, uses the other to hold his pom- pom out of the way, and vomits. \nHaving vomited, and spit, he staggers off toward the street. \nSUPERED TITLE OF THE MOVIE: \nBAD SANTA \nC.U. PHOTO PRINTING OUT \nThe Photo Elf takes the digital photo and presents it to a MOM. \nPHOTO ELF (dutifully reciting his spiel) My, what a darling picture! Are you certain you only want the single? Additional photos come in handy as gifts for grandma and grandpa or a wonderful remembrance for friends. \nMOM That's all right, I'll just take the single. \nHe takes her credit card as CAMERA MOVES OVER TO SANTA. On his knee is a YOUNG BOY who whispers excitedly in his ear. \nSANTA (disinterested) Uh-huh... yeah... done. \nYoung Boy climbs off and runs away, A BRATTY KID jumps up on Santa's lap. \nBRATTY KID I saw you in another mall. \nSANTA (not even looking at him) Right... Good for you. \nBRATTY KID You're not really Santa. If you were Santa you could do magic. \nSANTA (looks at him) You want magic? \nSanta pushes him off his lap and shoves him on his way. \nSANTA There, I just made you disappear. \nSanta turns to his Elf, \nSANTA ...That it? \nThe Elf nods as he peels off a pointed prosthetic ear. Santa pulls a fifth of Old Grandad from the cushions of his throne. \nSANTA ...Thank fuckin' Christ. \nHe takes a swig. \nINT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - NIGHT - LATER \nWith the sound of closing circuits, banks of lights systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty store. \nINT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - EXIT AREA - NIGHT \nDownstairs the last of the store employees file out the door past an old SECURITY GUARD. Eventually Santa emerges. \nSECURITY GUARD Merry Christmas, Willie. \nSANTA Up your ass. \nThe guard chuckles. \nSECURITY GUARD Have it your way, Willie. \nSANTA Don't tell me which way to have it. \nThe Security Guard heads for a panel near the doorway and punches a key labeled ARM. An L.E.D. readout labeled \"ARMING\" counts down from 30 seconds. \nThe guard exits the store, locks the door and heads home. \nINT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - SANTA'S WORKSHOP - NIGHT \nA large Teddy bear sits under a Christmas tree. \nSuddenly -\u0097 it moves, bolting upright and sprinting from the room. \nINT. MILWAUKEE DEPARTMENT STORE - DOWNSTAIRS - NIGHT \nThe alarm continues to count down -- 15... 14... \nThe Teddy bear slides down the space between the railing of the escalators. Landing on its feet, it barrels toward the door. \nINT. RATBAG APARTMENT - DAY \nWillie, in bed, blearily wakes to the insistent alarm. He tries to turn it off, but his fingers are still clotted with sleep. \nIn a series of frustrated grunts and groans he becomes more and more aggravated until, finally -- \nWILLIE FUCK YOU, YOU FUCKING PIECE OF SHIT! \nHe bolts out of bed and throws the clock into the wall. \nHe stoops for some beer bottle empties and hurls them at the clock debris. \nWILLIE Fuck you! Fuck you! Fuck you! \nOne final scream and it's out of his system. He finds one last bottle in his hand, half-full with a cigarette butt floating in it. \nHe downs the beer and steps into the adjoining bathroom to brush his teeth. \nEXT. KEY BISCAYNE STREET - DAY \nWillie, sipping a cup of coffee, meanders down the street scratching his ass. \nEXT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nWillie's walk brings him to a fancy eatery at lunchtime. As he passes, he casually snatches a handful of car keys from the parking valet key-box and moves on. \nAs he rounds the corner into the lot he pushes on the various key fobs, identifying various cars when their alarms chirp. \nHe seems dissatisfied until a brand new Cadillac chirps. \nWillie gets in and drives off. \nINT. CADILLAC - MOVING - DAY \nWillie drives. He reaches over into the glove compartment and pulls out the registration. He focuses on the car owner's address. \nINT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - HALLWAY - DAY \nWillie, eating a corn dog, saunters down an opulent hallway, a beer swinging in one hand. \nINT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - BATHROOM - DAY \nIn long shot, through the open door of an extravagant marble bathroom, we see Willie sitting on the toilet, leafing through a magazine, beer bottle on the counter next to him. Pants around his ankles. \nINT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - BATHROOM - MINUTES LATER \nWillie, standing by the toilet, finishes buckling his belt and flips the flush lever. \nNothing happens; no whoosh of rushing water. \nWillie, looking down into the toilet, gives the lever a couple more clanking tries, and then grabs his beer and ambles off. \nINT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - STUDY - DAY \nSucking on his beer, Willie paces the periphery of the room, methodically knocking painting after painting off the walls. \nINT. UPPER-CLASS HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - DAY \nWillie arrives in the bedroom still knocking down paintings until, finally, he exposes a wall safe. \nA smile, and he pulls out a stethoscope. \nCUT TO: \nThe safe door swings open to reveal stacks of cash. \nINT. STRIP BAR - NIGHT \nWillie scratches a lottery ticket. He's now wearing a Rolex and some gaudy ring. \nHARRISON Aw, forget it! \nHarrison stomps away and right toward Marcus and Willie as they enter the store. \nHARRISON ...Hacks! \nWillie and Marcus stop in their tracks and watch the burly man storm out. Bob Chipeska watches with them. \nCHIPESKA Hi. Bob Chipeska. I, please, I, uh -- please don't listen to him. Great resume and photo by the way. \nMARCUS Thanks... you know, we been at this a long time an' all, so we like to think we do a good job... \nA Beautiful Girl wearing skin-tight pants walks by, catching Willie's eye. He stares wantonly at her ass, off in his own little world. \nCHIPESKA You two are the best men for the job. Truly. So do not let his... unpleasantness affect your performance in any way. \nMARCUS Oh no, we're fine, w -- \nWILLIE (irked, snapping out of his daydream) Performance? \nWillie's reaction worries Marcus. \nCHIPESKA Yea. Your performance... you know, the... \nWILLIE Performance. Like sexual? \nCHIPESKA Excuse me? \nMARCUS Willie no, he -- \nWILLIE You saying there's something wrong with my gear? \nMARCUS Willie... \nCHIPESKA I'm sorry. Your gear? \nWILLIE You know... fuck stick. \nMARCUS OKAY! We're gonna head upstairs now. \nMarcus shoves Willie, who stalks off. Marcus lingers to smooth things over. He forces a grin and shakes his head. \nMARCUS Such a card. \nCHIPESKA He's not gonna say \"fuck stick\" in front of the children, is he? \nMARCUS No, no, no. Joke. Adult joke. For us. Adults. \nA long, long, long silence. \nMARCUS ...Joke. \nAnother beat. Marcus pantomimes helpless laughter, noiselessly throwing his head back and holding his gut as it heaves with mirth. \nHe is instantly composed. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY \nOn an upper floor of Chamberlain's the theme is \"The Desert as Winter Wonderland.\" Cacti and tumbleweeds are wrapped with lights and flocked with snow, and a team of nine stuffed burros are hitched to a sleigh. Rudolfo the Red Nosed Burro is tended by several Santa's elf mannequins. One in cowboy wear and another in a poncho and sombrero. \nAgain there is a line of waiting children. Marcus makes his way through the line as kids gasp and cheer. He plays to the crowd. \nMARCUS Merry Christmas! Santa's coming! \nYayyyyyy! Marcus gets to the head of the line, ducks under the velvet rope and goes behind the flimsy cardboard set. \nWillie sits there morosely, head slumped, forearms on knees, red velvet hanging limply from one hand. \nMARCUS What the fuck you doing, \"fuck stick\" in front of the boss? \nStill nothing. \nWILLIE ...Next, goddamnit! Let's move it along -- this is not the DMV! \nMarcus walks over to the rope. The snot-nosed Kid is next in line, frozen by fear. Marcus pulls on his hand. \nMARCUS It's okay. C'mon. \nThe Kid stays put. \nMARCUS What's your name? \nThe Kid shakes his head meekly. \nMARCUS ...You can tell me... \nNo response. \nMARCUS ...How about Santa? If you don't tell him, you won't get a present. \nThis penetrates the Kid's fear. He moves. \nMARCUS ...That's right. Let's tell Santa. \nMarcus leads the Kid up to the throne and places him on Willie's lap. \nWILLIE What do you want? C'mon, wuddya want? A snot rag? \nThe Kid just stares, motionless except for the flowing rivulet of snot. Willie can't help but stare at it. \nWILLIE (to himself) ...Another fuckin' mongoloid. (shouts) Marcus I get him outta here before he pisses on me. \nSuddenly the Kid is moved to yank Willie's beard. He holds it stretched below Willie's chin. \nWILLIE (whispered to the kid) ...Let it go, you little bastard. \nKID It's not real. \nWILLIE It was real. The hair fell out when I got sick. \nKID How'd you get sick? \nWILLIE I loved a woman who wasn't clean. \nKID Mrs. Santa? \nWILLIE No, her sister. (whispers through clenched teeth) Let the fucking thing go. \nKID What's it like at the North Pole? \nWILLIE Like the suburbs. \nKID Which one? \nWILLIE Apache Junction. What the fuck do you care? \nWillie shoves the Kid: \nWILLIE Get the hell off my lap. \nThe Kid backs away, looking at him. \nKID You are really Santa, right? \nWILLIE No. No, I'm an accountant. I wear this as a fucking fashion thing. \nKID Okay. \nThe Kid backs away in awe, never breaking his reverent stare. \nTROUBLEMAKER ...This is not Flagstaff! \nSUE Another Grandad, Santa? \nWILLIE Yep. \nShe pours him another and slams it on the bar. \nSUE Got a name? \nWILLIE Oh yeah. \nHe pounds the drink. \nShe waits. Nothing else is forthcoming. \nSUE What do you do? I mean, after the holidays? \nWILLIE Nothing 'til March. Then I'm the Easter Bunny. \nSUE ...Another? \nWILLIE Why not. Buy you one? \nSUE Why not. \nShe pours two. They both pound them back. \nHer statement is a question: \nSUE ...Not a big talker. \nWILLIE Nah. \nSUE Buy you one? \nWILLIE Why not. \nAs she pours: \nSUE You're pretty regular, for a Santa. \nHe shrugs: \nWILLIE It's my job, no big deal. I'm an eating, drinking, shitting, fucking Santa Claus. \nSUE Prove it. \nWillie stares at her. \nWILLIE Which? \nINT. WILLIE'S CAR - PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nWillie is on top of the barmaid, humping her, still in his Santa suit. His pom-pom bobs in rhythm with his thrusts. \nWILLIE Yes! Yes! Yes! \nSUE Fuck me, Santa! Fuck me, Santa! \nThe hat is slipping askew. He reaches for it. \nWILLIE At least lemme take off the hat! \nSUE NO! \nEXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nIn the parking lot the barmaid finishes straightening her clothes and touching up her lipstick in the rearview mirror. \nKID Uh-huh. \nWILLIE And you're right there to grab his fuckin' balls. \nKID Uh-huh. \nWILLIE Right height. \nKID Yeah. \nWillie demonstrates with a sharp turn of his hand: \nWILLIE Twist 'em. \nKID Why do you need a car? \nWILLIE ...Fuck you talkin' about? \nKID This car. \nWILLIE Whuh. Which turn is it? \nKID Sage Terrace. Where's your sleigh? \nWillie answers absently, his head slightly ducked and his eyes darting side to side, checking for road signs: \nWILLIE Repairs. In the shop. \nKID Where're the reindeer? \nWILLIE I stable 'em. Is it gonna be left or right? \nKID (pointing left) That way. Where's the stable? \nWILLIE Next to the shop. \nKID How do they sleep? \nWILLIE Who -- the reindeer? Standing up. \nKID But the noise, how do they sleep? \nWILLIE What noise? \nKID From the shop. \nWILLIE They, uh, they only work during the day. \nKID I thought it was always night at the North Pole. \nWILLIE Not now. Now it's always day. \nKID Then how do they sleep? \nWILLIE Well, they -- WILL YOU PUH-LEEEZ SHUT THE FUCK UP! HOW THE FUCK DO KNOW?! I'M GONNA -- Whoa! Sage Terrace! \nHe makes a hard left. \nWILLIE ...What is it with you? Somebody drop you on your fucking head? \nKID On my head? \nWILLIE What, are they gonna drop you on somebody else's head? \nKID How can they drop me onto my own head? \nWILLIE Not onto your own h -- ARE YOU FUCKING WITH ME? \nEXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nHe puts the folio back, grabs the cash. \nKID You need money to fix your sleigh? \nWILLIE Huh? Yeah, whateverthefuck... \nKID You want milk and cookies? \nWillie bends down and faces the Kid with a smile. \nWILLIE Daddy got a car? \nEXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nAt the cut a new Mercedes screeches through the frame and, as we hear it recede, we are left looking at the kid, who stands at the curb, waving happily. \nKID Bye Santa! \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - SECURITY OFFICE - NIGHT \nCLOSE-UP: the glowing ash of a cigarette burning down. The inhale lasts as long as comic timing will allow -- about six or seven seconds. \nANGLE ON: \nA wiry, hard-bitten, sun-baked saddlebag of a man, GIN SLAGEL sits behind his cluttered desk sucking on a filterless Pall Mall. We can hear his in-taken breath rattling over and around the phlegm, growths, and polyps that line his embattled trachea. His words come out on an exhaled cloud chamber's worth of smoke: \nGIN \"Fuck stick\"? \nBob Chipeska sits opposite. \nCHIPESKA Yes, I thought it was strange too, but you know, I, I, I, I, uh, I, his little friend promised he wouldn't say it in front of the children. Which is fine because, you know, urn, there's an adult world and a child's world and that's okay. I'm not a censor. \nGIN Little friend? \nCHIPESKA Yes, a, a, a dwarf. Or midget... a, a, I don't know what he's called exactly but... a little guy. Little. Billy Barty. God rest. But thin fingers. Not the fat sausage fingers. \nGIN \"Little people,\" that's what they like. \nCHIPESKA Ah, yes, right. \nGIN So \"fuck stick,\" that's all? \nCHIPESKA Well, no, there was something else... \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WOMEN'S BIG AND TALL - (EARLIER) \nChipeska walks by a cashier station carrying some paperwork he's absorbed in, but hears some FAINT GROANS that make him pause. Curious, he heads in the direction of the sounds. \nThey're coming from the dressing room area. \nChipeska curiously makes his way towards a corridor of dressing rooms. \nCHIPESKA (V.O.) ...A couple of days ago I was in Women's Big & Tall? -- \nA sign reads: \"Three Times A Lady\". \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - DRESSING ROOM AREA - (EARLIER) \nHe goes down a corridor of dressing rooms. \nCHIPESKA (V.O.) and I heard these, urn, you know, these... noises. \nThe sound of throttling lust builds in volume. He follows his ears until he arrives at a dressing room door. A Big or Tall woman within screams with pleasure: \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Oh yeah! Oh yeah! \nWILLIE'S VOICE (O.S.) Yeah! Yeah! You ain't gonna shit right for a week! \nHe looks underneath and spots black Santa boots with red velvet pants around the ankles. \nWillie opens the door and an avalanche of beer bottle empties tumbles out, rolling everywhere. \nMARCUS You cocksucker! \nWillie starts the engine and pulls out, and Marcus yells to the receding car: \nMARCUS ...EVER HEAR OF THE OPEN-BOTTLE LAW?! (then, to himself) -- You dumb Dipshit Motherfucker! \nEXT. RESIDENCE MOTEL - NIGHT \nWillie parks the Mercedes in the front of a rundown motel complex. He walks past hookers and junkies until he gets to his unit. \nHe pulls out his key and just as he's about to insert it in the lock he sees a flashlight beam shining inside the window. \nSurprised, he backs off cautiously and presses up against the wall. \nSomeone inside is rifling the room. \nWillie hisses at a nearby hooker: \nWILLIE Opal, come here. \nOpal looks at him with disdain. \nOPAL Screw you, Willie -- last time I didn't shit right for a week. \nWILLIE No, not that -- come here! \nReluctantly, she sidles over. \nWILLIE Who the fuck's in my room, did you see someone go into my fuckin' room? \nOPAL Yeah some guy askin' 'boutcha -- looked like a cop. \nWILLIE Ah fuck. \nINT. MARCUS' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMarcus is on the phone with Willie. \nMARCUS What guy?! You get a look at him? \nINTERCUT: \nEXT. RESIDENCE MOTEL - NIGHT \nWillie is at a pay phone. \nWILLIE No, I think it's a cop though. You think someone's onto us? \nMARCUS Is there anything in the room? Anything professional? \nWILLIE No. Clothes. \nMARCUS Just ditch. You got anywhere to sack out for a while? \nINT. THE KID'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT \nThe Kid swings the door open to Willie, who stands on the stoop holding a small grip. \nKID Santa! \nWILLIE Yeah. \nKID You're bringing my present early? \nWILLIE NO. \nKID But I never told you what I wanted. \nWILLIE No. \nKID Warm milk? \nWILLIE No. \nWillie carefully, carefully puts glass and bottle down on the nightstand and slowly raises both hands in a \"Don't... Move\" gesture to keep them from flying off. \nKID Should I fix you some sandwiches? \nWILLIE What is with the fixing sandwiches? No. \nSatisfied that the bottle and glass are not going anywhere, Willie climbs unsteadily onto the bed and stares at the ceiling. \nKID Okay. You want anything else? \nWILLIE No. As soon as the bed stops moving I'm going to sleep... \nKID Okay. \nWILLIE ...Wake me up... when the little hand is on the... \nA long beat. \nThe ragged breath of drunken sleep. \nKID Okay. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - SCARF AREA - DAY \nMarcus's wife Lois stands in front of a mirror, trying on a cashmere scarf. Her look of pruney disapproval is in place, as ever. She takes off the scarf and writes something in a small spiral notebook... \nSALESWOMAN Can I help you, ma'am? \nLOIS Just looking. \nAcross the store, she spies the jewelry counter. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - JEWELRY AREA - DAY \nLois stands looking intently down through the glass case in pruney disapproval. \nSALESMAN Help you with anything, ma'am? \nWithout bothering to look up: \nLOIS Just looking. \nAs he drifts away she takes out her spiral notebook and makes more notes. \nINT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - FOOD COURT - NIGHT \nWillie and Marcus nosh on food-court Gyros. \nWILLIE Fuck me? Fuck you! \nMARCUS You can't just take up with some kid! You don't know who's around, what they do! \nWILLIE You got some nerve you little shit ya. You my mom now?! You shat me out your -- \nMARCUS You said that last night you stupid fuck! \nWILLIE Ah, shit! Fuck you! \nLois appears with a salad on a tray and a look of pruney disapproval. She sits next to Marcus and, in the way of old couples comfortable with each other, he rests a hand on her knee and continues to talk, ignoring her, while she picks through her salad, ignoring him. \nMARCUS You are by far the dumbest most pathetic piece of maggot-eaten shit that has ever slid from God's gilded ass! What if the kid has one of those fucking play-dates they have now? \nWILLIE You shittin' me?! He doesn't have fucking friends! Not even an imaginary one! Unless he got ditched by him! He's just a fuckin' misfit! Lives with his grandma who sits drooling in front of the TV! Every once in a while she gets up to play soccer with her tits! What, she's gon' rat me out? She don't know her ass from last Tuesday! \nINT. THE KID'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nTwo tall water glasses are set down on a sideboard. \nWILLIE (O.S.) Refill? \nSUE (O.S.) Mm. \nA splash of orange juice is dolloped into each of the glasses, and then both are filled to the top with vodka. \nWIDER on the living room reveals Sue looking around. Her speech -- and Willie's -- is somewhat impaired: \nSUE Nice place you got. Needs a bit of a woman's touch, but it's really nice. \nWILLIE It's okay. Just renting. \nSue accepts her refilled glass and sits on the sofa. \nSUE Thanks... So how long will you -- urn... \nShe reaches down to fish under her ass in the sofa cushion, and pulls out a red checker. She dully inspects it. \nSUE ...How long you gonna be here? \nWILLIE Through the holidays. \nSue flips the checker away. \nSUE So what's the thing, you like kids? \nWILLIE Fuck no! Whaddya think I'm some kind of pervert? \nSUE Wha? I'm talking about you being Santa. \nHe sways, looking at her. \nWILLIE Oh. No, see, the thing is... I'm not really Santa. \nBlearily she gazes back. After a moment: \nSUE Oh. (pause) ...Well -- still -- I gotta thing for you anyway -- c'mere... \nHe leans down to kiss her. \nINT. THE KID'S HOUSE - FOYER - NIGHT \nThe door opens to reveal Sue on her way out. Willie sways in the foyer, a three-quarters-empty bottle of Old Grandad in hand. \nSUE So I'll see you soon I guess, right? \nWILLIE Yeah, I'm gonna send you some flowers. Real good expensive ones. \nHe closes the door. He then tips back the bottle and polishes it off with a series of quick gulps. \nEver so daintily, he puts the bottle down. A beat later -- \nWHAM! He faints dead away, hitting the floor like a felled tree. \nFADE OUT: \nFaintly, distantly, a blood-curdling scream. \nFADE IN: \nINT. THE KID'S HOUSE - FOYER/HALLWAY - MORNING \nWillie wakes on the floor to the sound of the scream. \nWILLIE Whuh... \nMARCUS Thirty-five. \nGIN Half. \nMARCUS Forty. \nGIN Half. \nMARCUS Forty-two? \nGIN Half. \nMARCUS Forty-two five. \nGIN Half. \nMARCUS Fooooooorty... eight. \nGIN Half. \nMARCUS Forty-nine? \nGIN Half. \nMARCUS Well... \nMarcus sighs. \nMARCUS ...what's one point. \nGIN Down the middle on the dough, and any merchandise you take I look over and cherry-pick. \nMARCUS No! Money's one thing, but \u0097-- \nGIN It ain't Chinese menu, jagoff. I tell yea how the way it's gonna be. This is pricks ficks. \nGin leaves. Marcus and Willie stare at his retreating back as they talk: \nWILLIE ...Pricks ficks? \nMARCUS Ah, he's a fuckin' moron. \nWILLIE Yeah, well I guess that's how you got the upper hand. \nMARCUS Fuck you. \nWILLIE Negotiating. \nMARCUS Fuck you -- you don't like it, next year, fuck off. I can always get another box jockey. \nWILLIE Yeah, and I can get another midget. \nMarcus turns to Willie: \nMARCUS Yeah? Where? You see us hangin' off of fuckin' trees? Like fuckin' crab apples? And even if we did, you'd never front your own racket. 'Cause you got no discipline and zero fuckin' initiative. You'd fall apart without me. You're just too fuckin' pathetic -- \nWILLIE Yeah, yeah. \nMARCUS -- too fuckin' pathetic for words, you fuckin' loser. And you fuckin' know it. \nINT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWillie drags his ass through the front door, dejected. \nGRANDMA Roger! You're home. Let me fix you some sandwiches. \nHe stares at her. His gaze is far away. Finally, he seems to rouse himself: \nWILLIE Ah, fuck it. \nWillie, dreamy, refuses to take the bait: \nWILLIE No no. No; I beat the crap out of some kids today -- but, you know, for a purpose. It really made me feel pretty good about myself -- like I did something constructive for a change. Accomplished somethin'. \nMarcus stares at him. \nMARCUS ...You need many years of therapy. Many, many, many, many, many... many fucking years of therapy. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - FURS - DAY \nLois, her face set in pruney disapproval, flips slowly through a rack of furs. \nA salesman approaches from behind her. She somehow senses his presence; without bothering to look around she murmurs: \nLOIS Just looking... \nINT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nWillie and Sue come in, carrying a few bottles of liquor. \nWillie closes the door, and freezes, realizing that something is wrong. \nWILLIE ...Hello? \nNothing. \nWILLIE ...Granma? \nHe hears the TV and heads for the living room. Sue follows a few steps behind. \nWillie finds Grandma in her chair, not moving. \nWILLIE Granma... \nHe strains through the dim light for any evidence of life. \nWILLIE ...Oh jeez. \nHe lets out a sigh and leans in close to listen to her heart. \nSUE Oh my God... \nGRANDMA Roger! \nWillie jumps and screams like a girl. \nGRANDMA ...You're home. Let me fix you some sandwiches. \nShe gets up and heads for the kitchen as Willie tries to compose himself. \nWILLIE (holding his chest) No thanks. \nINT. THE KID'S HOUSE - KID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe Kid sleeps. He is awakened by the sounds of stumbling and CLANKING BOTTLES. He hears GIGGLING, more STUMBLING. He gets up. \nINT. THE'KID'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe Kid discovers some clothes. Then some more. He follows the trail of clothes towards the sounds coming from the Master Bedroom. \nINT. THE KID'S HOUSE - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nFacing the CAMERA, Willie's in his underpants and Santa hat lying on the floor on top of Sue. He's gripping her panties with his teeth -- stretching the elastic while he starts pulling them down. Sue's giggling. \nThe bedroom door opens behind them and the Kid walks in. He comes up and stands over them, a few steps behind Willie. \nWillie freezes, panty elastic waistband still stretched out in his teeth. He senses something, and his eyes look up from under his Santa hat, his wolfish smile fades. \nThe Kid stands there, hands behind his back. \nWe see Gin exit the store and head for his car. \nMARCUS There he is... that lousy, leatherfaced, dago motherfucker... \nEXT. QUIET ROAD - NIGHT \nMarcus stands by the side of his van. It's parked on the shoulder with the hood up, jumper cables attached and hanging. Lois is in the driver's seat. \nGin's Ford 4 X 4 speeds around the corner and Marcus flags him down. \nSCREEEEECH! Gin slams on the brakes, then backs up and pulls over. He emerges from the 4 X 4 with road rage on full brew, and strides over to the van. \nGIN Jesus, Mother Mary and Joseph! What in the name of the holy lord Fuck is the problem now? \nMARCUS Sorry, the van stalled. Give us a jump will ya? \nGIN Well, I'll be dipped in dogshit!... What am I, your auto mechanic now? \nHe shakes his head in disgust. Grumbling, he goes back to the 4 X 4 and drives it into position. He gets out and raises the hood. \nThe two vehicles face each other nose-to-nose, several feet apart as Gin opens the hood. \nGIN (motions to his battery) Help yourself, small fry. \nMarcus seems to have a little difficulty reaching the battery terminals. \nMARCUS It's hard for me to reach... \nGin grabs the cables from him. Marcus takes a few steps back. \nGIN Jesus Christ, give me those! \nMARCUS Thanks. \nGin attaches the cables. \nGIN (then, to Lois) Alright, TRY IT! \nLois turns the key and the van starts right up. Gin takes the cables off the van and closes the hood. He lights up a Pall Mall. \nMarcus signals to Lois. She puts the car into gear and stomps her foot on the accelerator, squashing Gin between the two vehicles. \nANGLE PROM INSIDE VAN (SLOW MOTION): \nGin's face as it's squooshed up against the van's windshield. \nA cloud of cigarette smoke escapes his lips. \nLois continues to step on the gas, trying to crush him. \nANGLE ON: the tires spinning in the gravel. \nFinally, she takes her foot off the gas. The van eases back. \nGin falls to the ground with a groan. Marcus steps up and leans over him. \nMARCUS Oh my, what a terrible accident! \nLOIS Is he dead? \nMARCUS No, but it looks like you broke most of his ribs. \nThen, leaning down to Gin. \nMARCUS (for Gin's benefit) I'd say maybe... fifty percent of them? Or do you think thirty percent? \nLOIS I needed more of a running start -- I couldn't build up any speed. \nMarcus paces around trying to figure out what to do next. \nMarcus moves the backdrop to reveal the air vent. \nMARCUS Let's go. \nWillie cracks open an ampule of Amyl Nitrate and inhales deeply. Marcus grimaces: \nMARCUS ...Oh Christ. \nWILLIE (red-faced, holding breath) Let's do it. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT \nWith the sound of closing circuits, banks of light systematically shut down in the various departments of the now empty.store. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nExhausted employees file out of the store past Jesse. \nEventually Willie emerges. \nJESSE Merry Christmas, Willie. \nWILLIE Up your ass. \nJesse heads for the alarm panel near the doorway and punches the key labeled ARM. An LED readout labeled ARMING counts down from 30 seconds. \nJesse exits the store, locking the door and heading home. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICES - NIGHT \nThe cubicles are now empty and the office is still, but we hear dwarf-shimmy in the ducts overhead. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nBy the front door, the alarm continues to count down -- 25... \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCT - NIGHT \nMarcus arrives at the vent above the surveillance room. He reaches in his pocket, pulls out the remote control Lois bought, and aims it down into the room. \nINT. CHAMBERLAN'S - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - NIGHT \nThe huge bank of VCRs powers down. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nALARM BOX \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCT - NIGHT \nMarcus arrives at the precipice of a descending duct. He snaps on a biking helmet and takes a deep breath. \nMARCUS All right... \nHe dives down the duct. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCTS - NIGHT \nWe PAN and WHIP-PIVOT along the outside of several lengths of ductwork, following the muffled SCREAM of a thousand girlies echoing inside. \nThe ductwork dimples out along the bottom with the WUBBA sound of flopping aluminum as Marcus's weight travels its length; at turns, Marcus's inertial force makes one side of the duct momentarily dent out. \nWe thus follow Marcus's progress as he slides, bumps, ricochets and barrels through the department store. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - MAIN FLOOR - ENTRANCE - NIGHT \nAs the alarm continues to count down, 12... 11... a distant \nscream grows louder until -- \nMarcus starts in Ladies' Accessories, finding the cashmere scarf. \nWillie applies the drill to the safe. \nMarcus makes his way through Lingerie. \nWillie pulls back the drill. The bit is trashed, the safe is completely unscathed. \nMarcus is in Shoes picking out pumps for Lois. \nWillie is in Home Improvement, flipping tools off the shelves into a cart of his own. \nMarcus is in Evening Wear, jumping to try to pull a stole off a mannequin. \nWillie batters a chisel into the seam of the safe door. \nMarcus continues to leap at the mannequin. \nWillie is atop the safe, swinging a sledgehammer at the lock. \nMarcus swings at the mannequin's knees with a golf club. \nWillie uses a plasma welder on the safe. \nMarcus, having chopped down the mannequin, drags off its stole. \nWillie is back over the safe, battering it with the sledgehammer, roaring with each swing. \nMarcus is in Housewares pilfering crock pots. \nWillie, sweating, drops the sledgehammer clanking to the floor. Wiping his forehead, he circles the safe. When he gets to the back of the safe he stops, thinks. \nMarcus is in Home Entertainment grabbing a stereo. \nWillie is hunched at the back of the safe, stethoscope to its surface, giving exploratory taps with two knuckles. \nSound perspective through the stethoscope: hollow THUNKS followed by an unnaturally loud and present CREEEEEEEEAK. \nWillie reacts quizzically. After a considering moment he rises. we can see, on the far side of the safe, its door as it finishes creaking open. \nMarcus enters the room. Willie looks at him. \nWILLIE Piece of cake. \nMarcus starts removing stacks of cash and loading them into the Santa sack. Willie wipes sweat off his forehead. \nWILLIE ...I'll be right back. I gotta grab one thing. \nINT. CHAMBERLAN'S - TOY DEPT. - NIGHT \nWe are looking at a big, fuzzy, smiling, pink stuffed elephant. \nWillie's hand hesitates between this elephant and the one behind, which is purple. We hear him muttering: \nWILLIE Shit... which did he say? \nThe hand finally leaves with the purple elephant. \nWe hold for a long beat. \nThe hand reenters to put back the purple and take the pink. \nWillie turns around holding the stuffed elephant. \nMarcus and Lois are standing there presenting a grotesque picture: Lois has a shopping cart filled with shoes, scarves, jewels, a salad spinner, purses, a block of Ginsu knives, an abdomen exerciser. She wears a pair of sunglasses from which a price tag dangles, and a long ermine stole. \nNext to her Marcus holds the Santa bag bulging with -- indeed, sprouting -- cash. \nWILLIE Well, I don't think that store dick is gonna want this. \nPolice everywhere. \nMEGAPHONE VOICE And you, Santa! -- drop the elephant! \nWillie stares. Marcus looks wildly around. \nMARCUS ...Where did you come from? \nCHIEF Tipped off. \nWILLIE Shit! \nCAMERA TRACKS IN ON HIS FACE \nWillie slaps his forehead. \nWILLIE ...Fuckin' kid! \nCHIEF All three of you are in so much shit it's almost unbelievable. \nLOIS Gevalt. \nMARCUS Oh yeah? Well come'n get us, coppers! Ha-ha-ha-ha! \nBANG! BANG! BANG! \nHis .45 roars. \nThe cops return fire. \nWILLIE Fuck me... \nHe ducks, clutching the elephant to his chest, and scurries behind a counter. \nWILLIE ...fuck me fuck me fuck me... \nGunfire fills the air. \nExploding merchandise chases along the counter behind Willie as the cops seek to put him down. \nUnder the gunfire we hear Marcus's maniacal laughter. \nWillie reaches the end of the counter. A brief open space separates him from a stairwell; he dashes across as gunfire redoubles and plunges down the stairs. \nEXT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - LOADING DOCK - NIGHT \nWillie bursts out onto the loading dock still holding the elephant. He dives into his Mercedes and peels out. \nEXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - NIGHT \nRounding the corner of the loading dock, Willie comes upon a fleet of squad cars idling in the street. Cops yell, draw their guns and fire as Willie clips a couple cars, skids and slues, and finally is clear of the pack. \nHe roars up the road as policemen leap for their vehicles, crank up their sirens and pursue. \nINT. MERCEDES - MOVING - NIGHT \nWillie drives, his jaw set, a desperate man in a Santa suit. \nHe glances up at the rearview which shows many flashing light bars. \nWILLIE ...It's Christmas... and the fucking kid is getting his present. \nEXT. THE KID'S HOUSE - NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT \nWillie's car corners onto Sage Terrace on two wheels, slams back down onto four, fishtails up to the kid's house and squeals braking into its driveway. \nThe police vehicles, in hot pursuit, squeal, skid, and slew around in a jumble at the foot of the lawn. Cops leap out of their cars just as Willie jumps from his. \nMEGAPHONE VOICE Halt, put your hands up! \n", "test1_input": "MARCUS Morning Jesse. \nJESSE (to Willie) Ho! Ho! Ho! \nWillie pants under the weight of his bag: \nWILLIE Up your ass. \nEXT. SAGUARO SQUARE MALL - PARKING LOT - MORNING \nAs Willie and Marcus enter the store Gin Slagel drives by their cars, carefully noting their tags. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - WINTER WONDERLAND - DAY \nWillie drops the bag with a loud thud. \nWILLIE GOD dammit! \nMARCUS You tear your ball again? \nWILLIE No, it's okay. \nTogether they unload the extremely heavy gifts. \nMARCUS Let's do the other thing. \nWillie follows Marcus behind the Wonderland backdrop. Marcus points to an air duct in the ceiling. \nMARCUS There. \nWillie crouches and Marcus climbs on his shoulders. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - AIR DUCT - DAY \nThe duct pops open and Marcus climbs in, shimmying down to a junction and continuing on. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - CUSTOMER SERVICE OFFICES - DAY \nA long row of cubicles, each one occupied with Customer Service Operators. As they work, the loud squeaks and popping metal sounds of a dwarf crawling through a duct are heard above them. \nEach operator in succession notes the racket, looking up curiously as the sounds pass overhead. \nSuddenly, the sounds stop. Everyone returns to work. \nThen... \nSQUEAK! POP! SQUEAK! The sounds resume. The operators look up again as the noises fade away. \nINT. CHAMBERLAIN'S - SURVEILLANCE ROOM - DAY \nThe sounds continue until Marcus' face appears at the ceiling duct of an unmanned surveillance room. \nHe focuses on the wall of a hundred identical VCRs and squints to see the brand name: SONY HVR-3200. \nEXT. ELECTRONICS STORE - DAY \nLois exits an electronics store with a box slung under her arm, her mouth turned down in pruney disapproval. She places the box on the hood of her car and we see its printings SONY HVR-3200. \nShe opens the box, fishes out the remote, then tosses the box and VCR into a nearby trash can. \nEXT. ARIZONA STATE PRISON - DAY \nGin Slagel walks through the main gate of the heavily fortified penitentiary, leaving a huge trail of cigarette smoke. \nINT. PRISON - WAITING ROOM - DAY \nGin Slagel sits, smoking and waiting with family members and lawyers. A guard enters and motions. \nGUARD Alright Gin, come on. \n", "test1_true": "Gin sits down in one of the booths across from a middle-aged prisoner. \nPRISONER Who are you? \nGIN Your name Roger Merman? \nPRISONER Yes, but -- \nGIN Doing three-to-six for embezzlement? \nPRISONER ...Many accounting questions are not cut-and-dried -- \nGIN You live at 41 Sage Terrace? \nPRISONER (suddenly tense) Is it Granma?

Willie sees off another child, \nCHILD Pokemon. \nWILLIE Done. \nMARCUS Next! \nMarcus heads to the velvet rope to find the Kid, mussed up and dirty, the band of his underwear around his chest. \nKID Santa here? \nMARCUS Oh jeez. \nMarcus unclips the rope and the Kid approaches Willie. \nWILLIE Is that your underwear? \nKID Part of it. \nWILLIE Where's the rest? Never mind. What do you want? \nKID I was thinking I wanted a purple stuffed elephant, not pink, but now I changed my mind. \nWILLIE What. \nKID Now I don't want an elephant at all. I want a gorilla named Davy for beating up the skateboard kids who pull on my underwear and he could take his orders from the talking walnut so it wouldn't be my bad thing. \nWillie stares at him. \nWILLIE ...You know when I was your age, I didn't need no fuckin' gorilla, and I wasn't any bigger than you. One day I came crying home to Dad because four kids had beat me up, and you know what he did?' \nKID He make it all better? \nWILLIE No. He kicked my ass. You know why? \nKID You went bathroom on Mommy's dishes? \nWILLIE What the fuck? No. \nKID He try to teach you not to cry and be a man. \nWILLIE Nope, it was because he was a mean, drunk son of a bitch.

You can wish all you want but you gotta take what you need. Stand up for yourself... stop being such a pussy and kick those kids in the balls or something. (pause) Or don't, I don't give a shit.

Where's the grandson? \nGIN Open the rope there, Marcus. \nMarcus, wary, hesitates but then lets him through. As they walk toward Willie: \nMARCUS I know you? \nGIN Not yet. \nWillie is irked by the arrival of an adult: \nWILLIE Santa don't do grab-ass, cowboy. \nGIN Act natural. \nWILLIE Huh? What? \nGin sits on Willie's knee. \nWILLIE ...What the fuck?! \nGIN You are Willie Tugboat Soke and you are Marcus \"The Prince\" Skidmore. On Christmas Eve, you're gonna rob this store blind. What say we go somewhere private? \nINT. BLACK ANGUS BAR - NIGHT \nWillie, Marcus and Gin sit in a booth. \nGIN Research, that's how. I'm a department store detective Sherlock, that's what I do. Seven cities in seven years. Pretty impressive. The stores change, your names change. You always get away clean. Yeah, pretty darn impressive. But let's face facts -- you all are a couple of half-bucket small-timers. Because of your physical attributes you've found a niche. I respect that. But you've also been caught. By me. So this is the way how we gonna do things. I don't want to take over, I don't even want to change your scam. Whatever you guys do, it works. All I want is a taste. When the deed is done, we part ways. I buy a ranch in Havasu, you take your little medicine show back on the road. \nMARCUS (sighs) How much? \nGIN Half. \nWillie bolts out of his chair and grabs Gin by the neck. \nWILLIE Now you listen here, you -- \nMarcus pulls him off. \nMARCUS Easy! Easy! Just back off, Willie. I can handle this. \nAfter a hard stare Willie settles back into his seat. Marcus turns his attention to Gin: \nMARCUS Okay. Thirty percent. There's three of us.

And no friends.\" \nWILLIE Who the fuck is Thurman? This is you? Your name's Thurman? \nKID Yeah. \nWILLIE (incredulous) Thurman Merman?! \nKID Yeah. \nWILLIE Jesus. \nKID (back to the report card) You think I did good? \nWillie does not want to engage. \nWILLIE Whaddya you care what I think, anyway?

Fuckin' Leonardo da Vinci. \nGIN What did you call me, thigh-high? \nMARCUS I called you a fuckin' guinea Homo.

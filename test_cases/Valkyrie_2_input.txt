STAUFFENBERG What are you trying to say? 
BERTHOLD I seem to remember you telling me about reports from the Ukraine - the SS forcing Jews to dig their own graves. You said then that Hitler should be removed. An officer's duty, you said. What's changed? 
STAUFFENBERG I said senior officers. The only men that can get to him. 
BERTHOLD Perhaps it doesn't matter that you succeed. 
Stauffenberg looks at Berthold like he is crazy, but: 
BERTHOLD (CONT'D) Perhaps it only matters that you try. Don't you see? Someone has to stand up and show the world that not all of us were like him. 
STAUFFENBERG Even if they could remove Hitler, they can't hope to seize power. For God's sake, they have no plan. 
BERTHOLD Then give them one. Find a way. 
He puts a hand on Stauffenberg's arm. 
BERTHOLD (CONT'D) Evil happens when good men do nothing. 
Before Stauffenberg can answer, new music comes blasting from the phonograph O.S. The unmistakable sound of Wagner's Ride of the Valkyries. 
STAUFFENBERG Children, that is far too- 
He is cut off by the appearance of his four children, all wearing cloaks made of bed sheets, pots for helmets and brandishing makeshift swords. They charge into the room, singing loudly and attacking their father. He does his best to defend himself with one hand. Their commotion causes the phonograph to skip. 
And you'd think that's where it ends. We even pull back, creating that effect. It takes a moment to notice the wailing sound we're suddenly hearing is not on the phonograph. Nina hears it first, then Stauffenberg and Berthold. Finally the children freeze and the phonograph skips without their help. The glasses on the table rattle. 
Now we hear the wailing quite clearly. A siren. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Air-raid. 
The adults herd the children out of the room. Muffled concussions cause the phonograph to skip frequently, turning Wagner's masterpiece into a stutter. 
28   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - BASEMENT - NIGHT               28 
The family rushes down the stairs, huddling in a corner - adults holding shivering children. The bombs are closer, louder. The Wagner, the siren, the explosions fray the nerves. 
Stauffenberg reaches for Nina in the darkness, finding her belly. Her hand clamps around his - around their unborn child. 
BOOM. So close the children scream. Dust and debris fall from the ceiling. The needle rakes the phonograph upstairs going back to the beginning. 
CLOSE ON STAUFFENBERG - on his eye. His thoughts as the bombs fall all around his home - a moment of profound realization... 
29   INT. STAUFFENBERG FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT            29 
Move across the room to the phonograph, looking down at the 78 spinning on the turntable. The camera begins to turn until all the world around us is spinning and only the record is still. We read one word of the title of the 78 quite clearly: 
STAUFFENBERG (V.O.) Valkyrie. 
30   INT. SMOKY ROOM - NIGHT                                 30 
Stauffenberg faces the top members of the Resistance. 
OLBRICHT We've already considered Valkyrie. It isn't suitable. 
STAUFFENBERG Not as it's currently written. 
GOERDELER Excuse me. What is Valkyrie? 
TRESCKOW Operation Valkyrie. 
Tresckow explains even as he studies Stauffenberg, curious. What does he have in mind? 
TRESCKOW (CONT'D) The Reserve Army has thousands of men all over the city - most of them not even in uniform. Valkyrie is top secret plan to mobilize those men in a national emergency. 
STAUFFENBERG Hitler designed it himself to crush any internal unrest if he's cut off or killed. 
GOERDELER And what use is that to us? 
STAUFFENBERG The orders could be rewritten. A few subtle changes would put those reserve units completely under our command. 
OLBRICHT Yes, of course, but- 
STAUFFENBERG Now what would the High Command do if they thought, say, the SS was staging a coup? 
OLBRICHT They would declare a military state of emergency.

Gigi nods - it's all under control. 
GIGI (reading off her paper) Hey, Conor. It's Gigi. I just thought, I hadn't heard from you and, I mean how stupid is it that a gal has got to wait for a guy's call anyway, right? 
Gigi laughs, but as she looks back to the notes, she seems confused. She turns to Janine, panicked, mouthing - "What does this say?". Janine looks - she's no help. 
GIGI (CONT'D) (clearly ad-libbing) I mean, we're all equal, right? More than equal -- more women are accepted into law school now than men, and we do better in those police simulations where you can mistakenly shoot innocent people - (rifles through the pages) - I mean I don't know if you saw that Dateline - but women practically have penises now, right? (looks to Janine, helpless) Well, call me. This is Gigi. Call me. 
Gigi hangs up, unsure.   She looks to Janine. 
JANINE Don't worry.    He's totally gonna call. 
INT. GIGI'S APARTMENT - LATER 
Gigi stares at the PHONE. Then she feigns disinterest in the phone. It still doesn't ring. Finally, she picks up the receiver to listen for a dial tone. And PANICS. 
GIGI WHAT?   How can there be no dial tone? 
She frantically jiggles the cord, then hears something. 
GIGI (CONT'D) Mom? Is that you? I can't talk now. I'll call you back. 
She hangs up, stares at the phone again. A look of DETERMINATION crosses her face. She dials. 
GIGI (CONT'D) Janine. It's me. Conor never called, so I'm on the precipice of staging a casual run-in at Red Maple. Pick up if you want to stop me. (beat, then really fast) 
ALRIGHT-I'M-INTERPRETING-YOUR-SILENCE-AS tacit-compliance-bye. 
Gigi hurriedly hangs up, and heads out the door. 
INT. RED MAPLE - NIGHT 
A CROWDED, SCENEY restaurant/bar - with a giant red Japanese maple growing behind the bar (thus the name). 
We follow a THIN, BLACK CLAD HOSTESS as we wind through the throng of stylish twentysomethings at the bar to: 
INT. RED MAPLE - KITCHEN - SAME 
A busy kitchen.   Off the kitchen a door leads to: 
INT. RED MAPLE - OFFICE - SAME 
ALEX sits at a small, cluttered desk, rifling through some papers. Then, from the doorway: 
KELLI ANN Knock knock. 
Alex looks up to see KELLI ANN - Red Maple's hot hostess, standing in the doorway. She makes her way in. 
ALEX Hey. 
KELLI ANN So.    Here we are. Same shift again. 
ALEX I know.    I make the schedule. 
KELLI ANN 
(FLIRTING) I figured it was no coincidence. 
She leans against the desk.     Alex keeps working. 
KELLI ANN (CONT'D) I had fun the other night. 
ALEX Yeah. It's amazing where 10 shots of Patron will get you. 
Kelli Ann laughs, then thinks - wait, was that nice? 
KELLI ANN Anyway - I was thinking, maybe tonight after work...we could, you know... 
Alex stops what he's doing, looks up at her. 
ALEX Look, Kelli Ann - what happened between us the other night was - fun. But we're way understaffed tonight - I even have to man the bar - and that's why I scheduled you. To work. So... 
He goes back to work. Kelli Ann stands there, frozen. Alex can feel her eyes on him. 
ALEX (CONT'D) Are we good here? 
Kelli Ann's face goes flush. She tries to hide it.    She backs up, puts on a smile. 
KELLI ANN No.    We're good. 
She leaves.   Alex exhales, goes back to work. 
INT. RED MAPLE - LATER 
In the back doorway leading to the alley, Alex stands chatting with TYRONE, 18, a busboy, who smokes a cigarette he holds just outside the doorway. 
Kelli Ann approaches, trying to squeeze through, and 
ACCIDENTALLY (ON PURPOSE) SHOULDER BLOCKS ALEX. HARD. He has to take a step to catch his balance. 
He turns around to see what happened, but Kelli Ann keeps walking eyes front. He and Tyrone share a look. 
TYRONE Dude.

{"train": "HELLRAISER: HELLSEEKER \nWritten by \nCarl Dupre \nINT. CAR DRIVING DOWN COUNTRY ROAD - DAY \nKIRSTY GOODING looks out the passenger window as the trees go whizzing past. She's attractive, late twenties, warmly sophisticated. Something makes her smile. She turns to the driver and thinks real hard as she says this. \nKIRSTY Okay. Cubic root of nine thousand two hundred and sixty one. \nTREVOR is her husband, late twenties as well. God gave him brains and beauty. He has used them both prodigiously. \nTREVOR Twenty one. Why do we have to do this now Kirsty? \nKIRSTY Shut up and play darling. Your turn. \nTREVOR Five hundred ninety two thousand seven hundred and four. \nKIRSTY Uh... eighty two? \nTREVOR Eighty four. \nKirsty takes a calculator out of her purse and double checks the math. \nKIRSTY You win! Okay pull over. \nTREVOR (looking at his watch) But... I thought... \nKIRSTY (laughing) If what I've heard is true this could be the last time for a long long time. Besides we've got a whole seven minutes before the next one. Clock's ticking. Tick-tock... \nTrevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding. \nKIRSTY (through clenched teeth) PULL OVER NOW. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThen pulls over to the side of the road. Kirsty reaches over, quickly unzips his pants immediately goes down on Trevor OUT OF FRAME. He reacts accordingly. A little pleasure, utter shock. \nKIRSTY'S VOICE (from BELOW FRAME) Honey what's wrong? \nKirsty rises INTO FRAME once again. \nTREVOR What isn't wrong? Why are you doing this anyway? \nKIRSTY (self-conscious) I'm... I'm doing a very special thing here. And you can't even ... respond? \nTREVOR Sorry honey the present situation isn't exactly fodder for an erection. Shouldn't we be getting to the hospital? \nFULL ON Kirsty. For the first time WE SEE her big pregnant belly sticking out. She looks at Trevor innocently. \nKIRSTY I was going to keep breathing you know. You think I'm an amateur or something? \nTrevor stuffs himself back in his pants, puts the car in gear and presses the accelerator. \nTREVOR Just concentrate on the task at hand please. Listen to me. You should be giving ME this lecture. \nKIRSTY You've been cheating on me haven't you? \nTREVOR Yes I had a quickie with the neighbor during your last contraction. \nKIRSTY Roughly two thirds of married men who cheat start during the eighth month of their wives' first pregnancy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTREVOR I would never cheat on you. Not while you're pregnant now you know that. \nKIRSTY (features tightening) Okay... uh oh here comes another one. \nTREVOR Share the pain Kirsty. \nThe rest is a blur... \n... Trevor loses control of the steering wheel... Kirsty SCREAMS... Their car skids from one side of the bridge to the other-careening toward the guardrail- SMASH! \nThe car is plummeting toward the river below. Trevor and Kirsty brace themselves. The car hits the surface... \nINT. RIVER, UNDERWATER - DAY \nTrevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He breaks the surface and gasps for air. Getting his bearings he see the car bobbing on the surface, the current is separating him from his wife. \nTreading water, he looks out at the car and there she is trapped inside... \nKirsty \nStill belted to her seat. Her eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, sinking fast... Kristy pounds the window with her hands, trying to get out. She's trapped. \nApparently giving in, she presses a hand against the windshield just before the car disappears under the surface... \nEXT. SHORE - DAY \nTrevor paddles hard to the shore. Exhausted, he crawls onto the shore underneath the bridge they just jumped. \nTrevor stands trying to process what just happened in the last fifteen seconds. He screams out for his wife, and to what has just happened. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTREVOR Kristy! Kristy! \nTrevor drops to his knee's in distress. \nTREVOR (cont'd) Oh my God, Kristy! Please Kristy. (frantically) I'm so sorry, Kristy. \nHe hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of the bashed-up guardrail from the bridge has just snapped off and is sailing right down toward him- \nTREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM \nWHITE LIGHT FLOODS HIS VISION... \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nTrevor's eyes blink open, darting left and right. He is on a bed, his head bandaged. \nAN ANGULAR NURSE ENTERS the room, walking up to Trevor's bed. \nTREVOR Where is she...? Where's Kirsty? \nThe Nurse grabs Trevor's right arm and straps it to the side of the bed. She isn't exactly one of God's gentler creatures. \nTREVOR Hey, what are you- \nShe moves to Trevor's legs, strapping them down as well, then his other arm. \nBy now SEVERAL SURGEONS ENTER the room, features obscured by surgical masks. \nThe Nurse fastens a clamp around Trevor's head, attaches it to the bed. \nTrevor is completely discombobulated. The surgeons gather behind Trevor's bed. \nCLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE as he struggles to see what's happening back there but it's useless. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe cannot move a muscle. He hears a sickening SAWING noise and his eyes bulge in horror. \nWIDE as the doctors calmly lift Trevor's freshly sawed cranium from his head exposing his brain. The CHIEF SURGEON- a large unshaven man with magnifying lens alreaday in place make his eyes enormous and his face grotesquely distorted. He walks up, presented with a tray full of evenly arranged pins. He cranks up the magnification of his lenes which make his eyes appear even larger. Though no one speaks his name his name tag reads Dr. Barker. \nTREVOR What are you people doing?! \nThe Chief Surgeon takes one of the pins and gently pushes into a Trevor's frontal lobe. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) What's happening to-! \nCONTINUED: (4) \nAmbrose gives Trevor a fatherly smile then EXITS, not even looking at Allison. Allison watches him go, then turns back to Trevor... then smiles perkily. \nALLISON Well looks like you're going home! Hope you brought your bus pass. \nINT. BUS - NIGHT \nTrevor starts nodding out. The bus is practically empty. TWO BLACK CHILDREN a boy and a girl sit across from Trevor. A CREEPY OLD WOMAN sits further back, knitting something. \nA CHURCH BELL RINGING causes Trevor to wake again up, wincing at the sound. As the church passes the BELL becomes louder and louder. \nTrevor hears LAUGHTER and looks up at the children. The girl and her brother seem to be play-fighting over a toy they hold between them. Trevor looks at the toy getting stretched this way and that. \nTREVOR Do you kids mind keeping it down? \nThe creepy old woman speaks up. \nOLD WOMAN Aww let them be. They're only kids. \nTrevor notices what the Old Woman is knitting is a baby's bootie. As the children continue to laugh at him Trevor stares at the bootie tears welling up. \nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT \nTrevor lives in a dingy place, one step up from poverty- level. Funny thing is this used to be a nicer place. We see remnants of a feminine touch long since past. Dirty dishes sit in the sink. A cockroach skitters across the kitchenette. \nTrevor sits at his TV playing an extremely violent videogame. We're talking heads getting blown off, bodies exploding, limbs being severed. As the end ends a DEMONIC VOICE chuckles from the TV. \nDEMONIC VOICE FROM TV YOU LOSE... \nThe screen flashes TRY AGAIN? Trevor takes a swig of beer and sits back in the easy chair looking at something atop the TV. A picture of Kirsty. \nINT. TREVOR'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nTrevor looks through an old photo album. Pictures of him and Kirsty. Some pictures of him. A lot of pictures of Kirsty. Smiles, smiles, smiles... \nHe stops at one close up of them mugging at a camera they've pointed on themselves. All we see is their faces, the rest is dark and blurry, except for one thing. A small shadowy object Kirsty is holding. \nEXT. CUBIC ROUTE ACTUARIAL RESEARCH - DAY \nDressed in a button down shirt and tie, Trevor walks up to the pale utilitarian box-like structure. \nINT. CUBIC ROUTE, BULLPEN - DAY \nIt is a maze of cubicles iced by harsh fluorescence. It is a mill of data research, where the TAPPING of fingers on computer keypads never ends... \nINT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY \n... no thanks to Trevor, who has already resumed his head-in- hands position at his desk. He rubs his eyes, seemingly blinded by the screen staring back at him. \nA MAN Trevor's age rolls up on his office chair beside Trevor, banging into the desk. BRET. Trevor's co-worker and cubicle mate. \nBRET Trevor what is the metric probability of you getting any work done at all today? \nTREVOR Hey Bret. Christ, my head feels like a split coconut. \nBRET Dude there is a track on the carpet between here and the bathroom. It was made by your ass. You've been dragging it all fucking week. What happened to you yesterday? \nBret eyes Trevor suspiciously. Then smiling... \nBRET (cont'd) You never came back after lunch. Did you get a piece o'ass, you bastard? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTREVOR Give me a break. I checked back into the hospital- amongst other things. \nBRET Hospital? You haven't been to the hospital since uh... \nTREVOR Since what? \nBRET (getting uncomfortable) Look never mind. Just get some numbers going- any numbers at all will due. The hills have eyes remember? \nBret casually gestures to a surveillance camera overhead that sweeps across the room like a prison spotlight. \nGWEN Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nTREVOR That was cold... \nGWEN No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold. \nThis goes through Trevor like a shot. EIGHT MONTHS! \nHere we go- Dolly in zoom out! In Close up of Trevor we... \nFLASHBACK \nQUICK FLASHES of Kirsty's hand pounding on the windshield, the car sinking into the lake, a quick cut of a dark figure with a bright ring, and shots of two naked bodies slamming against each other in climax course through Trevor's mind. Finally, over the images of erotica we hear Gwens voice as one of the characters. \nGWEN (cont'd) Yeah, Trevor thats it. Thats it. \nAnd back in the real world, Trevor is now locking lips with a very ready Gwen. His hand is up her skirt. He stops abruptly and pulls back. \nTREVOR I'm sorry Gwen. I don't know what's happening to me. (zipping up) I think it's the painkillers, really. \nGwen rolls her eyes. She re-adjusts her self and now getting a little pissy. She's heard this one before. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) They mess with my head. Yesterday gets blacked out and a memory from months ago is played out in vivid technicolor. Like the accident just happened you know? \nGwen softens up. Trevor is so earnest, so vulnerable. \nGWEN Why don't you let me take you out tonight? I promise to make it the most memorable night of your life. \nShe kisses him. He braces himself. She grabs his butt, then goes for the door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nGWEN (CONT'D) Pick you up round seven. And Gooding? Get some fucking work done. \nINT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY \nTrevor relentlessly crunches numbers at his computer. He pauses a moment to stretch and rubs his eyes. A PING from his computer announces he has an INTEROFFICE MEMO- FILE ATTACHED. Trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen, clicks. \nUp comes a jpeg slideshow. Each picture is of Gwen dressed in a piece of sexy lingerie. The caption underneath reads WORK HARDER. Looking around his cubicle, he then takes another look at the jpeg. Trevor stands up in the cubicle and we see him peer the outer office looking for Gwen. He sits back down. Embarrassed Trevor closes the memo at least for now. \nTREVOR'S PHONE RINGS. Startleing him(and us). He picks it up. \nTREVOR (into phone) You got Trevor. \nMAN'S VOICE (from phone) Trevor hi this is Detective Lange from homicide. It's about your wife. \nPush in on to a bewildered Trevor. \nINT. LANGE'S OFFICE, HOMICIDE - DAY \nIt is a dank crumbling room. A place where sunlight is not welcome. DETECTIVE LANGE, a handsome graying gentleman who's plagued with a chronic case of post nasal drip, sits at his desk. \nTrevor sits across from him. Behind Trevor is another empty desk. \nAs Lange speaks he SNIFFS wetly every so often. \nLANGE (to Trevor) Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now? \nTREVOR Where's my wife? \nLANGE Okay then. Here's the scoop. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLange takes out nasal drops and squeezes some in each nostril as he speaks. \nLANGE (CONT'D) (cont'd) We still haven't been able to locate your the body in that river. And missing persons turned up some evidence that qualified the disappearance as foul play. \nLange checks the report again. He believes Trevor...or does he? \nLANGE'S VOICE That's a start. I'll tell the people trawling the river maybe it makes a difference maybe not. Thanks for your help Trevor. If we have any more questions you'll get a call from myself or my partner Detective Givens. \nLange stands up and backs up awkwardly to a file behind his desk. Trevor stares at him suspiciously. \nTREVOR You guys know something I don't? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLANGE All things considered we probably know a lot less than you do. Have a good afternoon, Mr. Gooding. \nTrevor exits, both men maintain eye contact as the door closes between him. \nEXT. BUS STOP - NIGHT \nThe bus pulls up to the curb. Trevor climbs out and starts walking down the empty street. As soon as the bus pulls away, the only sound heard is Trevor's footsteps. \nPOV BEHIND TREVOR: We see Trevor's back from a slight distance. Someone is following him. \nSensing this, Trevor looks behind him. Nothing but an empty sidewalk. Trevor hurries his pace, almost there at his apartment building. He glances behind him again. Nope, nobody there... then suddenly- \n-A DARK FIGURE passes under a streetlight on the opposite side of the street. Trevor turns a corner no picking up the pace a little. The DARK FIGURE follows, it picks up it's pace as well. \nTrevors walks an d approaches a small alley way. Should he take this home? \nA enraged Pitbull nearly rips his nose off as it Barks and lunges to the end of a heavy chain leash. Trevor (and us) about piss our pant's. The dog continues barking, Trevor regains his composure. Suddenly the dogs attention moves toward the direction of the DARK FIGURE. Amazingly, it stops barking and actually cowers back into the shadows. \nSpooked, Trevor rushes up to: \nEXT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT \nHe hurries up to his apartment building and lets himself in. \nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT \nHe looks out on the street. \nThe figure is walking up the building opposite his. It's features are shrouded in shadow, but it is definitely staring at Trevor, who slams the apartment door behind him. He peers out at the street from inside the front hall. \nThe figure is gone. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTrevors looks around the apartment. He opens the fridge, it lights up the darkened room. He grabs one of the three items sitting on the wire racks. About to twist off the cap off a cold beer, when a light out his window urges him to investigate. He draws the curtain open and GASPS. \nPOV OUT WINDOW: Staring back at him, from a dimly lit window in the apartment building across the street, is the SHADOWY MAN that followed Trevor home. \nThe man's face is shrouded in shadows but Trevor can see he's holding something bundled up in a blanket. The light in the window winks out, rendering it dark again. \nTrevor can almost still see the figure somewhere in the darkness still gazing at him. \nTrevor looks a little sick all of a sudden, like he can't breathe. \nTHE BELL FROM A DISTANT CATHEDRAL begins to peel. BONG... BONG... BONG... \nTrevor opens his mouth to draw in a breath but instead spits out a massive amount of water! \nBONG... BONG... BONG... \nTrevor falls to the ground, arms and legs thrashing, heaving up mouthfuls of water. Trevor is drowning... \nBONG... BONG... BONG... \nIn the puddles of water, we see bits of debris: leaves, pebbles, etc. Finally, a hideous eel-like creature's head pokes out of Trevor's gaping mouth- it escapes and slithers across the floor, up the window sill and out into the night. \n-the ringing bell stops abruptly and he takes in a humongous lungful of sweet oxygen. He then notices he is completely dry. Stunned, he looks about him. \nTrevor is now laying on the easychair, nursing a beer. His videogame is flashing PLAY AGAIN? Whoa. \nThe BING-BONG! of his doorbell startles him. \nKIRSTY How does feel to be Mr. Kirsty Hughes for a whole year. \nTREVOR (OFF CAMERA) In a word? Lucrative. \nKIRSTY The best business decision if you ever made I'll bet. \nTREVOR (OFF CAMERA) Enjoyable too. The merger never even felt work for one second. \nKIRSTY You know what the family lawyer told me one our wedding day? \nTREVOR (OFF CAMERA) What? \nKIRSTY Never to put you in my will. \nTREVOR (OFF CAMERA) Really? Why? \nKIRSTY Because you'd be staying with me for me and not because you'd get rich if I died for some reason. \nTREVOR But you had more wisdom than to listen to a false prophet \nKIRSTY There is no wisdom, no insight, no plan (prvb 21:30) \nThey share a moment.    Kristy stares at him quietly through the camera. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nKIRSTY (CONT'D) And besides, I thought, to hell with it... it's okay if you only married me for my money. \nTREVOR (OFF CAMERA) Really, why's that? \nKIRSTY I only married you for your body. \nThey laugh. The camera now looks away from Kristy and into Trevors suitcase. Trevors pulls out a wrapped present. A small tightly wrappped, perfectly square gift. \nKIRSTY (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nThe camera now back on Kristy. And the present comes up into frame. \nTREVOR (OFF CAMERA) Happy Anniversary, Mrs. Gooding. \nKIRSTY For me? Trevor! How romantic! Come here, you. \nThe camera begins to wobble as Trevor climbs onto the bed. Its lands sideways, and we see sheets and covers rustling, accompanied by the sound of giggling and kissing. \nThe tape ends. SNOW. \nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT \nFROM THE COUCH Trevor watches this...Any of this ringing a bell? \nBING BONG! \nTrevor gets up and pops the tape out. \nBING BONG! \nHe slowly walks toward the door. He opens it to find a pitch dark hallway. \nTREVOR Hello? Who's out there? \nGWEN suddenly comes out of the darkness clamping her mouth onto his and examining his tonsils with her tongue. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGWEN Sorry I'm late dear. \nTrevor looks like he'd be more turned on sitting bare-assed on an autopsy table. \nTREVOR Gwen you scared the living shit out of me. \nShe pushes him toward the chair and sits him in it. \nAllison stands above him Bic razor in her gloved hand. The bottom half of Trevor's face is covered with shaving cream. \nALLISON Sorry I thought you were going to stay under longer. \nHis face is clean shaven, a little shaving cream remains around his chin. He now has several electrodes attached to his cranium. They're connected to an EEG which BEEPS LOUDLY. The noise bothers Trevor. His eyes dart this way and that. He focuses on the Bic razor. \nTREVOR What's happening to me? What are you doing? \nALLISON You came in for your EEG. You fell asleep and well, I took the liberty of...I'm sorry. You looked like a wreck Trevor. \nTrevor seems to like the attention. \nTREVOR I just had the most vivid dream. I was sure I was dying. \nALLISON Well you can relax now you are quite alive. And as long as you're awake, chin up. \nTrevor puts his chin up and Allison continues shaving his neck. Trevor studies her face. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nALLISON (CONT'D) Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa? \nTREVOR (groggily) Let me see. Oh yeah. My head feels like it's going through a meat grinder. I'm not sure if I'm dreaming or... \nALLISON (interupting) That `poor me' attitude doesn't suit you Trevor. Listen, I don't mean to sound like Pollyanna but things could be worse. There's one good thing about coming so near to the end of ones life. Everything is new and exciting, like your seeing it for the first time. You might see things a litlle differently from now on. \nTREVOR Your insight is enlightening. \nALLISON No wisdom, no insight, no plan. \nAllison gives him a wink, disarming Trevor. \nTREVOR My wife said that exact same sentence to me the day we got married. She even winked too. \nAllison smiles and puts her hand on his. \nALLISON Do you use this wife thing to hit on all the interns? \nTREVOR (smiling) No... just you. \nAllison wipes his face clean with a towel. \nALLISON There. Just like a baby's butt. \nAllison gets up, grabs a clipboard starts filling out a report. Trevor stares at her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTREVOR Allison? Why can't remember what happened to my wife? Is it something I'm on that's... that's making me forget? \nALLISON Easy there Trevor. You need to relax. \nTREVOR No I need to remember. Look whatever it is take me off it. I can handle pain. I can't handle not knowing... \nALLISON You need to get better first Trevor. Way better. (scribbling in the chart) It's okay to miss somebody. It's okay to still love someone after they're gone. But you've got to quit blaming yourself okay...? Okay? \nAllison looks up and notices Trevor's body has slackened, his eyes empty. She drops the clipboard and starts snapping her fingers over his eyes. \nALLISON Trevor? \nHe is unconscious. A LOUD STEADY BUZZ sounds from one of the machines behind her as blood begins to leak out of Trevor's ear. Allison jumps up and hits call button above Trevor's bed. \nALLISON (CONT'D) CODE BLUE! \nShe yanks Trevor's johnnie down, wheels a defribulator over to his dying body and grabs the paddles. \nALLISON (CONT'D) It's okay Trevor I'm coming for you. \nAllison rubs the paddles together, presses the paddles against Trevor's chest and- \nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY \nBRET Me? This is your sick joke man. Gwen was murdered here six months ago. The security guard found her all over her office. Her head was in the waste paper basket. Her stomach was in the filing cabinet. Her ass was on the copy machine... \nTrevor is speechless. \nBRET (CONT'D) They never found the sicko who did it... remember? \nTrevor still can't speak. He goes into his computer mailbox and re-opens the file he'd received from \u00ecYou Know Who.\u00ee \nHe stifles a scream when he sees the jpegs have changed. Sure they're still of Gwen. Pieces of her swimming in puddles of her own blood. Where it once said \u00ecWork harder\u00ee it now says \u00ecPolice File.\u00ee \nTREVOR (to himself) Jesus Christ... \nTrevor looks behind him to make sure Bret hasn't seen any of this. He's facing his own computer typing away. \nBRET Man are you ever out of the loop. Either that or you've got the worst sense of humor this side of Jeffrey Dahmer. What is your problem anyway? \nTrevor quickly deletes the entire file. Finally... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nTREVOR Honestly Bret? I think I lost my mind. And now I'm finding pieces of it, like pieces of a wrecked car, scattered on the side of the road. \nA beat. \nBRET Bud you need to decompress. I told you you came back to work too soon after the accident. \nTrevor says nothing. \nBRET (CONT'D) Hey you know what Trev? I'm going to hook you up man. Here... \nBret wheels across the cubicle on his chair and hands something to Trevor. It's an oddly designed postcard bearing some sort of voodoo mask. The font is faux-Oriental, the kind they use for Chinese take-out menus. He looks closer. It's an appointment card for an acupuncturist. Sage. \nBRET (CONT'D) This woman will take one look at you and know exactly what you need. \nINT. SAGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nA chart of all the puncture points on the human body is tacked to the wall. \nTrevor lies on the table. SAGE, a gorgeous ethereal Indian woman is at the far end, hovering over the soles of his feet, sticking pins into the appropriate places. She looks up at him slyly. \nSAGE These headaches you've been getting. Do they happen in conjunction with the hallucinations? \nSage walks over to one of the cabinets, gathering more acupuncture needles. Trevor can't help but notice her shapely body, her feline gait. Sage throws a sultry glance over her shoulder at him, prompting him to finally answer her question. \nTREVOR (unsure of himself) Yes, sort of. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: TREVOR (cont'd) My head's been in constant pain since the... accident. And the pain increases whenever I, uh... slip into another, I don't know what to call them... \nSage comes back to him, several needles in one hand. She looks into his eyes. \nSAGE Dreams? \nTREVOR I was going to say dimensions. But I guess technically they are dreams. \nSAGE You should always listen to your subconscious. It's trying to tell you something about your waking life. \nSage begins applying the needles fluidly to his upper body now. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) But I never feel like I'm sleeping. It's sort of, waking narcolepsy. I'll be somewhere and then- (snapping his fingers) -it's like I was never wherever I was to begin with I was really somewhere else entirely. \nSage puts the last needle in. For the first time Trevor actually feels a releief of pressure in his head. \nTREVOR (cont'd) Ok, whatever that was...do it again. That just set me free of the worlds longest head ache. Is this making any sense? \nSAGE (CONT'D) None whatsoever. Now just relax. Let the needles do the driving. \nA PHONE OUTSIDE THE OFFICE RINGS. Sage looks up at the door. \nSAGE (CONT'D) (patting his cheek) Don't go anywhere. I'll be right back. \nTrevor watches Sage EXIT the office. He lies there a moment, bathing in warm sunshine. He is relaxed, pain free. \n(CONTINUED) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTAWNY (CONT'D) Taste this. \nKeeping a hand below his waist Trevor leans toward the spoon, tastes, licks his lips. Then squints. \nTREVOR Wow. That's good. Lots of capers, huh? \nTAWNY For starters. It's also got fennel, asparagus, olives, some more of mother nature's aphrodisiacs... Back in college, me and my roommates used to call it hard- on stew. \nTREVOR Not a very appetizing name. \nTAWNY Have some more. \nTrevor takes another sip of it. \nTAWNY (CONT'D) If you ever smelled this coming from our dorm room, you knew one of us was in there getting laid. \nTREVOR You must have been very proud of yourselves... \nTAWNY It's getting hot in here. \nTawny summarily unzips her rubber dress and whips it off. \nTrevor is speechless. \nTawny's body is covered with bites and bruises. \nTREVOR Jesus... who did that to you? \nTawny BUSTS OUT LAUGHING. \nTAWNY You're kidding right? \nTrevor shakes his head no. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTAWNY (CONT'D) You did! God, you are funny tonight. \nTawny approaches Trevor who tenses up. \nTAWNY (CONT'D) Almost like I'm with somebody else. \nTrevor starts looking very ill. \nTREVOR Tawny I think I'm going to be sick. \nTAWNY Well now there's a compliment. \nTrevor grabs his stomach, lurching over. He can't breath. Trevor looks up at Tawny. But it is no longer her. Tawny has changed into something else entirely. \nA CENOBITE. \nThe Cenobite rips Trevor's shirt open, and we can see movement within his abdomen. Like a baby kicking. Whatever's in their shoots up expanding Trevor's chest cavity. \nThe Cenobite pins Trevor to the wall and hovers in his face as if about to kiss him. \nBefore Trevor can scream he is choking. The Cenobite watches with glee as something begins to move up into Trevor's throat, expanding his neck, forcing his jaws open and finally... \n... a BLACK EEL pokes its head out of Trevor's mouth. The Cenobite opens its own mouth and the eel starts to crawl inside it. Meanwhile Trevor's about to pass out from asphyxiation when- \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \n-he takes a deep grateful breath through an oxygen mask. The various pieces of monitoring equipment around him are BEEPING and PINGING like slot machines. \nAllison walks around the room pressing buttons that silent each machine one by one, then walks up to the bed, looking surprisingly calm. \nALLISON Sorry about that. There was a blockage in your oxygen hose. Won't happen again, promise. \n(CONTINUED) \nTREVOR I... think we need to talk, there's something really strange going on... \nTAWNY (a look of recognition) Hey you're the guy from down the hall. \nTREVOR Come on, quit fucking around. Listen it's about... what we did together last night. \nTAWNY (utterly shocked) WHAT?! \nA VERY DEEP VOICE comes from somewhere behind her. \nVOICE Who the fuck is that? \nTAWNY It's that guy from down the hall. He thinks we did something with him last night. \nTREVOR Who's- who's in there with you...? \nTawny looks aghast. \nTAWNY Are you cracking up or something? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSuddenly an enormous BRUTE of a MAN, wide as he is tall ENTERS the doorway. He's wearing a black tee, black jeans and, Trevor can't help notice, black nail polish... on fingers and toes. Obviously Tawny's significant other. \nBRUTE What can we do for you, chief? \nTREVOR I... who are you? \nBrute takes a sideward step through the doorway, forcing Trevor back two steps. \nBRUTE You know Tawny, you better know me, pal. \nTREVOR Okay. I don't want any trouble. I was mistaken... I'll see you later. \nBRUTE Much. \nTrevor turns and hurries off. Brute turns to Tawny who shrugs and makes a twirly motion at her temple. The two go back into her apartment. \nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - DAY \nTrevor paces in his apartment telephone to his ear. He lets out a heavy breath and looks at his watch. Finally: \nOPERATOR (V.O.) City police main switchboard how may I direct your call? \nTREVOR You already asked me that ten minutes ago just before you put me on hold. I'm looking for defective- I mean Detective Lange. \nOPERATOR Oh he and his partner just stepped out to lunch, can I-? \nTrevor hangs up. \nINT. BUS - DAY \nTrevor sits at the front of the bus agitated. He folds and unfolds Detective Lange's business card in his hands like some frustrated Origami artist. \nThe SIREN from a passing ambulance drills his ears. The irritating sound eventually fades away but the pain in his head is still there. \nThe BONGING of a distant cathedral's bell makes him pause. He looks around. \nToward the rear and sees a familiar old lady knitting a baby's bootie. He looks again. The bootie is bright red and dripping... blood? Trevor follows the strand of bright red wool down to their source: \nA DYING GOAT laying under the seat. It's insides have been ripped out. Its veins and tendons are serving as the old lady's yarn. \nTrevor's eyes bolt back up to the old woman. She continues HUMMING sweetly, her lap speckled with goat's blood. Trevor pulls the wire and an OBNOXIOUS BUZZING goes off. Trevor hurries up to the bus driver as the bus pulls over. \nTREVOR Just open the doors I'll jump off. \nBUS DRIVER Not while the bus is moving, sir. \nTrevor clutches his head in pain and waits for the bus to stop. The doors open. He jumps off, knees nearly buckling from the pain. He looks up as the bus speeds off. \nIN THE REAR WINDOW the little black girl seen earlier pops up. She's holding her little doll. She pushes a clothespin into its head. Blood drips from the puncture. At the same time Trevor feels an incredible pain sear through his head. He squints at the bus again. The little girl is gone. \nINT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nLARRY (to Trevor's back) I never thought your late wife was the sharpest knife in the drawer. But marrying you was the dumbest thing she ever did! \nOn his way out Trevor nearly runs down Larry's ASSISTANT who was just coming IN with a large file. Trevor's gone. \nINT. CAB - DAY \nTrevor looks despondently out the window. The cab stops and Trevor hands some money to the CABBIE up front. \nTREVOR You can go. I'm going to be here a while. \nEXT. BRIDGE - DAY \nTrevor gets out of the cab, which drives off leaving him on the bridge looking down at the water below. \nEXT. BELOW BRIDGE - DAY \nPolice tape FLAPS between the trees. Other than that there is no sign of an investigation. Trevor walks out of the woods on the shore, through the police tape and to the water's edge. \nHe begins to walk the shore looking out at the still water. He scans the area where the water meets the land, trying to remember. \nSomething on the surface few feet away catches his eye. It's a rock sticking up. No it's something else. Trevor walks right up to the water and puts his feet on a couple of large rocks breaking the surface. He bends down and looks at... \nTHE CORNER OF A BLACK CUBE. He quickly reaches down, tries to pick it up. It seems to be stuck just below the surface. Trevor pulls harder and finally it gives. Trevor slowly lifts the black cube out of the water and GASPS when he sees- \n-A WHITE WATERLOGGED HAND CLUTCHING IT FROM BELOW! \nTrevor GASPS and lets go. And just as the cube (along with its owner) SPLASH under the surface- \n-ANOTHER WHITE HAND breaks the surface grabbing Trevor's wrist! \nAs Trevor Struggles he looks up to see the dark figure standing above him holding a rock over his head. Just as he swings down towards Trevors head- \nsmash cut to: \nINT. ALLISON'S OFFICE - DAY \nTrevor jumps scaring the hell out of Allison who has just gotten done taking his pulse. \nALLISON Jesus I wish you would stop doing that. \nTrevor looks down at himself. He's on an examination table in his normal clothes not a hospital johnnie. That's a good sign. \nTREVOR Allison... \nTrevor tries to put his thoughts together. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nALLISON Well Trevor? What have you got to say for yourself? Que pasa? \nTREVOR (voice quivering) Allison we have GOT to talk about this medication you've got me on. \nALLISON I'm all over it. \nAllison shines a penlight in his eye. \nALLISON (CONT'D) Blink. \nTrevor blinks. Satisfied, Allison sits on the bed next to Trevor and takes his hand. \nALLISON (CONT'D) Okay. What we're going to do is up the Topomax to two per day instead of one, see if that takes care of these hallucinatory seizures you've been having. The extra Topomax won't interfere with the painkillers either but... You're going to be thrilled to hear this part but we have been told by some patients it affects the memory somewhat... \nTREVOR (weary) Really? Does it affect the memory? \nAllison looks concerned. Then her features soften. \nALLISON You're one tough cookie, Trevor Gooding. You keep coming back to your corner for a quick fix up then go right back out into the ring for another round. \nTREVOR Some call it resilience. Others, stupidity. \nAllison lets a lapse in the conversation last too long. That look of concern returns as she lingers on his face. She's trying to say something. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) Everything okay Allison? \nTREVOR Yeah. It's like I was a different guy then I am today. I can't remember that guy. I see these women, they think I'm someone else, and I'm not that guy anymore. I'm not sure who Kristy knew. \nALLISON You were unfaithful, it sounds like your confessing. \nTREVOR I did more then that. \nAllison reaches accross the table for Trevors hand. A quiet moment. \nALLISON Com'on.   How bout some fresh air? \nEXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - DAY \nTrevor and Allison sit in a couple of chairs looking out at the other rooftops around them. \nTREVOR Lucky for us these chairs happened to be here. \nALLISON Oh I knew about the chairs already. This is where the emphysema patients come to sneak cigarettes. \nShe points to the ground at myriad butts scattered at their feet. Trevor smiles and looks at his hands. \nALLISON (CONT'D) Don't tell me. Kirsty used to smoke? \nTREVOR No. She just would have loved it up here... Allison when I was under... did I ever talk? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nALLISON Sure plenty of times. \nTREVOR Was there anything I said that made you stop and wonder, you know, \"where did that come from?\" \nALLISON Sure plenty of times. \nTREVOR Well? \nALLISON Trevor if someone is talking from a sleep state they are obviously dreaming. So practically everything say is going to sound strange. \nTREVOR Did I ever talk about the accident? \nALLISON No. \nTREVOR Did I ever talk about Kirsty? \nALLISON No. But at one point you did repeat something though. A phrase. You must have been having this recurring dream, you just kept saying this one thing over and over \nTREVOR What was it? \nALLISON You said, \"Jealousy arouses a husbands fury, and he will show no mercy when he takes revenge.\" (Proverbs 6:34) Does that mean anything to you Trevor? \nTREVOR It means I have alot more questions. \nTrevor stares off into the distance. \nALLISON Times up for today. I've got to get back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nAllison SMILES and pats Trevor's knee. He melts and puts his hand on hers. She slowly takes it away and fixes her hair. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) Sorry. \nALLISON If it makes you feel better that took every ounce of self control I had. Trevor, I never date patients. \nTREVOR I understand... I won't- \nALLISON No you don't understand. That's why I've been fighting to get you better. So you wouldn't be a patient anymore. \nTREVOR Why didn't you tell me sooner? I would have switched doctors! \nALLISON Just get better okay? \nShe caresses his face then looks at her watch. \nCONTINUED: \nSAGE It was an analogy. Your soul is locked up inside you. You need to free it Trevor. You've blocked it from the healing process. That's what we need to do now. Heal your soul. And to do that I you have to give in utterly and without any hesitation or doubt. Do you know what I mean by giving in? It's about trust. Do you trust me implicitly? \nTREVOR I don't even know what's real and what isn't how can I trust anyone? \nSAGE You can trust me. Your wife is dead and you need to move past that. And the only way to move past something completely is to go straight through it, not around it. Surrender yourself to your wife's death. Let it chew you up and spit you back out on the other side. It's the only way you can become whole again. \nSage looks Trevor dead in the eye. \nSAGE (CONT'D) Are you ready? \nTREVOR I surrender... \nTrevor closes his eyes \nA MONTAGE \nof Sage dimming the lights so that the room is nice and dark... placing needles into Trevor's body... his shoulders... his chest... his neck... his legs... his face... \nTrevor finally opens his eyes to find... \n... he's completely naked on Sage's table! And she's making love to his body, which is now filled with needles! \nTREVOR (CONT'D) Wait... what the hell is this... \nSAGE (whispering) Surrender yourself... surrender yourself... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nShe holds up a small chunk of ice and begins rubbing it on Trevor's chest. He catches his breath at the cold and begins to shiver. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nTrevor wakes up shivering. He is in the passenger seat, head resting against a baby blanket. A hand touches his... \n... Kirsty's. \nTREVOR Kirsty... Kirsty? \nKIRSTY It's okay it was just a nightmare that's all. \nTrevor looks at Kirsty. She is breathtakingly beautiful. \nTREVOR You're alive... \nKIRSTY Yes. Now go back to sleep. You're driving the rest of the way to gramma's remember? \nTrevor looks in the back and for the first time sees an INFANT GIRL sleeping in a car seat behind him. \nKIRSTY (CONT'D) Trevor I've decided we have got to agree on a name before we reach my mother's. This poor kid's going to be starting preschool as student x if we don't make up our minds. So, I've been thinking, what about Daisy? \nTREVOR (looking at the baby) It's perfect. \nKIRSTY Well that was easy all of a sudden. \nTrevor looks back at Kirsty. \nTREVOR Kirsty... I'm glad you're alive. \nTHE SIREN FROM AN APPROACHING AMBULANCE GETS LOUDER AND LOUDER, piercing Trevor's ears. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTrevor winces in pain and blocks his ears from the noise. Kirsty looks at him, puzzled. He can only read her lips: \"Honey what's wrong? Honey?\" \nINT. AMBULANCE - NIGHT \nTrevor's eye rivet open again. A PARAMEDIC is snapping his fingers in front of them. Another paramedic is readying a hypodermic. \nPARAMEDIC Can you hear me? Just nod. \nNURSE There there Trevor. Get some sleep. \nTrevor tenses when the nurse smiles. \nNURSE (CONT'D) If you need anything give myself or any of the nurses a call okay? We're- \nTREVOR Don't tell me. \u00ebWe're all here for you Trevor' right? Go ahead say it! You know you want to! \nThe nurse looks taken aback. \nNURSE What the hell are you talking about...? \nTrevor suddenly jumps up yanking electrodes and IV tubes from his body. The nurse is back to normal and very disconcerted. \nNURSE (CONT'D) Trevor! Mr. Gooding lay back down- \nTrevor runs out of the woman mowing the woman down in his tracks. \nINT. HOSPITAL HALLWAYS - NIGHT \nTrevor rushes down the halls of the hospital nearly knocking down Dr. Ambrose. \nDR. AMBROSE Hey! \nTrevor races as fast as his feet can carry him easily losing Dr. Ambrose. \nINT. OTHER WING - NIGHT \nTrevor runs down a corridor through another doorway and into another wing of the hospital entirely. He arrives at the door to Allison's office and throws it open. It's actually a janitor's closet. \nEXT. HOSPITAL ROOF - NIGHT \nDressed in janitorial garb, Trevor bursts open the stairwell door and comes out on the roof. \nAn OLD MAN in a johnnie is sitting in one of the chairs not too far away. An oxygen tube trails from his nose to an oxygen tank at his feet. \nOLD MAN (wheezing) Okay ya caught me. \nHe brings a cigarette to his lips and takes a long drag. \nOLD MAN (CONT'D) Least let me finish will ya? Got one puff left. \nTREVOR I don't work here. \nOLD MAN Music to my ears. \nThe old man lights a fresh cigarette with the one he's just finished. \nTrevor turns to go back and THERE'S ALLISON standing in the doorway. \nALLISON Trevor. I heard you were looking for me. Is everything all right? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTREVOR Allison! Am I glad to see you! (changing his tone) No... everything's not right. Not at all. \nALLISON Come here. \nAllison holds him. The old smoker turns and watches with curiosity. \nTREVOR Allison I think I did some very, very bad things. I mean very bad. \nALLISON Trevor things like this happen to people who experience temporary memory loss. Everybody does things they regret. You just couldn't remember doing these things and now you are so it's a shock to the system. I'm telling you. You will never get better if you keep blaming yourself for your wife's death. \nTREVOR Maybe I wasn't responsible for the car accident... \nThe old man calls out to Trevor wheezily. \nOLD MAN Hey buddy! \nTREVOR (ignoring him) ... but I'm starting to think I was... I was going to... \nOLD MAN Hey buddy! \nINT. CUBIC ROUTE ACTUARIAL RESEARCH, BULLPEN - NIGHT \nTrevor is thrust into the interior of his office building. Everyone's gone for the day. The only light is coming in from streetlights outside. Trevor races past the cubicles running out into a hallway. \nHe looks down one end then the other... where he sees an office light is on. He cautiously approaches the office. \nHe looks inside. \nINT. GWEN'S OFFICE - DAY \nGwen's hacked up body is strewn about the office. Her arms are atop the filing cabinet. Legs under her desk. Ass on the copier. \nTrevor hears someone coming. He looks down the hall to see A FLASHLIGHT BEAM TURN THE CORNER, blinding him. It's bearer begins running toward Trevor. \nTrevor bolts the other direction heading for the exit. He pushes the door open and slams it behind him only he's not still outside yet... \nINT. TAWNY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTawny lies on the bed, dead, tongue sticking out of her neck, ribcage violated. \nTrevor hears someone coming toward the bedroom can see the flashlight beam jittering as its bearer approaches. \nTrevor rushes toward the window, opens it and leaps out onto the fire escape. \nEXT. APT. BUILDING - NIGHT \nTrevor's about to climb down the fire escape when he is bathed in the flashlight's beam from inside. Trevor looks down and sees a garbage dumpster full of trash bags below. He jumps. \nTrevor sails down three stories and lands in the dumpster. He climbs out and runs to the street as fast as he can. He races down the sidewalk trying to get his bearings at the same time. \nHearing footsteps from behind Trevor turns to see: \nThe Stranger in the Window not half a block behind Trevor, keeping Trevor's pace. Then... Trevor stops. And turns. \nThe Stranger stops as well. This has never happened before. Trevor shouts down the empty street. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) WHO ARE YOU! \nHis voice echoes off the darkened buildings. \nThe Stranger stands there. Trevor begins walking toward him, blood in his eyes. The Stranger backs away. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTrevor bolts into a run and the Stranger takes off running the other way. \nThe stranger darts into an alley. \nINT. ALLEY - NIGHT \nTrevor runs into the alley, seeing no signs of the stranger. The end of the alley is pitch black. \nTREVOR WHERE'S MY WIFE?! \nTrevor hears something at the end of the alley. He grabs a broken bottle out of a garbage can and heads toward the darkness. Trevor's teeth are bared now. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) WHERE'S MY WIFE!? \nSomething GLISTENS in the dark just before the razor sharp edge of a switchblade touches his left jugular. Trevor freezes. OUT OF THE SHADOWS comes... BRET. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) Bret... what the fuck...? \nBRET Tonight was supposed to be the night, Trevor. Remember? I couldn't believe you went through five dart games and didn't even joke about it. \nTREVOR Bret. What the hell is going on? \nBRET We were gonna be millionaires you said. Nobody'd suspect a thing. I had never even met her. No connection. Then you went and had that fucking car accident. \nTREVOR Bret you are making no sense whatsoever. \nBRET I followed her Trevor. I got to know her life. And what a boring one it was. Six a.m. gym, nine a.m. trendy coffee shop, noon bookstore, one soap operas, four o'clock news, five wait for Trevor to come home. And wait and wait and wait. Nine o'clock get ready for bed. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: BRET (cont'd) Ten o'clock fall asleep in front of the TV. She did that every day I followed her. Every single day. While you were out fucking your concubines. Every day I felt more and more bad for her, man. And hated you more and more. \nThe trio comes to the line up room. \nINT. LINE UP ANTEROOM - NIGHT \nTrevor is shoved into the cramped booth-like room with four other strange looking MEN who all stare at him. Silence for a moment then: \nA LOUD BUZZ is heard and the door on the other side of room opens. \nCOP#1 Single file. \nTrevor follows the other men. The MAN just ahead of Trevor turns to him. \nMAN We're all here for you Trevor. \nCOP#1 NO TALKING! \nINT. LINE UP ROOM - NIGHT \nTrevor walks IN with the rest of the gentlemen. Hugging the nearest wall they go up a small set of stairs onto a stage. Trevor hears Lange's VOICE overhead. \nLANGE'S VOICE Stop and face the mirror! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe five men do as they're told, facing a large two-way mirror on the opposite wall. An awkward moment. \nLANGE'S VOICE (CONT'D) Thank you! \nThe door to the room opens again and Trevor turns, leading the other men back through the anteroom. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe cops hustle Trevor out into the hallway. The next door down opens and out come two more detectives and... TAWNY'S BOYFRIEND, the brute, looking fit to be tied. He sees Trevor and fills with rage. \nBRUTE I hope they fry your ass mutherfucker! \nHe lunges at Trevor. It takes the detectives he's with and two more cops to keep him from pummeling Trevor. As Trevor's lead away the brute begins to sob uncontrollably. \nBRUTE (CONT'D) (to Trevor) YOU'RE GONNA BURN IN HELL!! \nCOP#1 Got quite a fan club don't you, hotshot? \nINT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT \nTrevor sits at a tape recorder. Lange sits across from him. \nTREVOR For the last time. I honestly don't know how any of them died... \nLange stands, squirting antihistamine in his nose. He nods at Trevor and WALKS OUT. No sooner has the door closed when it opens again and Givens walks IN. Givens gets right in Trevor's face. \nGIVENS Now I want you to tell me what you remember happening- in your own words- exactly the way you told Detective Lange. But this time I want you to make one small adjustment. \nTREVOR What's that? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGivens whirls around revealing Lange's face on the back of his head! \nLANGE DON'T FUCKING LIE TO ME! \nTrevor thinks a moment. He is absolutely numb. He smiles a little insanely. \nTREVOR I did it. I killed them all. I confess. \nINT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - NIGHT \nStill handcuffed Trevor is escorted toward the detention area by the cops in the sunglasses. He's silently praying he'll wake up from this one somehow. No such luck. Trevor and the cops round a corner and there's Lange running up to them. \nLANGE (to the cops) Quick detour through the morgue boys. \nLange leads them to a set of elevators. \nDR. AMBROSE Makes you wonder what he was up to between the time he disappeared and when he died. \nAllison walks right up to the corpse's face. \nALLISON Well? What do you say Trevor? Que pasa? \nDR. AMBROSE (shivering) Allison what on earth possesses you to converse with cadavers? \nSAGE (looking at Trevor's corpse) It's simple, Dr. Ambrose. What if there is no afterlife? What happens when we die? Do we just stay stuck inside your bodies for eternity watching ourselves decompose? \nAMBROSE I'm not following this... \nALLISON Well if that's the case... wouldn't you want someone to talk to you like a normal human being one last time? \nAMBROSE You two are creeping me out. And I'm a coroner. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nAllison fixes a stray lock of hair on Trevor's forehead. \nQUICK CUTS: Allison slipping a tag on Trevor's toe; sliding Trevor's body into the morgue drawer; her hand turning the lock on the drawer. \nALLISON (O.S.) Adios amigo. \nINT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nLange sits across from Kirsty, who signs some paperwork on Lange's desk. \nKIRSTY I would have come in sooner but I had an important errand to run last night. Out of town. Figures you'd find his body the minute I decide to go off somewhere. \nLANGE Well you made it down here that's the important part. Thank you for your patience Mrs. Gooding. \nShe nods teary eyed. She slides the paperwork across his desk and gets up to leave. \nLANGE (CONT'D) One last thing... When they found him he was holding something. Not to get too graphic but they had to wrench it from his hand. \nLange reaches under his desk then stands revealing: \nTHE CUBE inside a ziploc bag. Lange and Kirsty exchange a knowing glance. \nLANGE (CONT'D) Figured you might want it. \nKIRSTY Of course. That was my... last anniversary present to him. \nLANGE A token to remember him by now. Goodbye Mrs. Gooding. \nShe takes the cube. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nKIRSTY Thank you detective. \nLange takes out his nasal sprayer as she walks OUT. She closes the door behind her and Lange looks up at the closed door. He sticks the sprayer up his nose. \nINT. POLICE STATION HALLWAY - DAY \nKirsty walks toward the exit. On her way she passes a trash can. She discretely tosses the cube into it and rubs her hands together. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - DAY \nThe birds are chirping. The sun is shining. Kirsty Gooding walks out the door and takes a breath of fresh air. She skips down the steps of the police station toward the street. She stops in the middle of the sidewalk looking both ways. \nA SHADOW COMES up behind her. It's the STRANGER Trevor had seen out his window. He grabs her shoulder startling Kirsty. She turns to see LARRY ELLIS, shit-eating grin on his face. He's holding an eight month old BABY. The one he was drawing. \nLARRY Looking for someone, Kirsty? \nKIRSTY (taking the baby) You bet I was. \nKirsty plants a multitude of smothering kisses on the laughing child as A NANNY comes up behind Larry pushing a stroller. Kirsty gently places the baby in it. \nKIRSTY (CONT'D) (to Nanny) Okay we're on our way. Remember her- \n", "test1_input": "TREVOR Uh thanks this looks a little important. Could you let the folks upstairs know I'll be late? \nRECEPTIONIST For you bubbalicious? (winking) I'd lay across a bed of nails. \nTrevor walks back OUT and the receptionist watches him go. Another female employee walks by staring at Trevor. She looks at the receptionist and they both nod in agreement. \nRECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) You know it girl. That ass is a three- hummer baby. Mmm-mmm-mmm. \nINT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nSame office only Trevor is sitting at the other desk across from a hawklike MAN who is playing with a yoyo. This is GIVENS. If good cop bad cop is the scheme here, he's the latter. \nTREVOR I'm sorry. I still... I don't understand how this is a homicide case. I mean nobody was murdered here... Her body's been missing for I don't know how long now and... \nGIVENS What did you just say? \nTREVOR I said she's been missing for- \nGIVENS No. No you said HER BODY's been missing. \nTREVOR What's the difference? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGIVENS Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead. \nTREVOR (tearing up) I saw her drowning inside the car, detective. \nGIVENS I read up on you, man. You're a smart guy aren't you? I mean with numbers. Right? \nTREVOR You could say that. \nGIVENS Zero's a number right? \nTREVOR As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this? \nGIVENS How many zeros was your wife worth? \nBrow furrowing, Trevor stands up. \nTREVOR I need to talk to my attorney. Now. \nGivens pushes his phone toward Trevor, who takes it and dials furiously. Givens remains poker-faced. Trevor dials a number. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) (into phone) Yes I need LARRY ELLIS' office please. \nHe says the lawyer's name like it's supposed to intimidate Givens. He couldn't care less. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) (a beat) Yeah this is Trevor Gooding I need to speak with Larry... Trevor...? Kirsty Gooding's husband...? (another beat) I see do you know when he'll be out that meeting? Fine I'll uh... call back then... Okay you give him the message and he'll call me that's great. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nWith that Trevor hangs up the phone and EXITS the office. Givens BUSTS OUT LAUGHING. \nINT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY \nTrevor types bitterly on the computer crunching numbers like a madman. \nBRET I don't know what pissed you off but it's nice to see you getting the job done for a change. \nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT \nTrevor plays his videogame with venom. The cries of his kills emanate from the TV, building to a crescendo. Finally we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE come from the TV. \nWOMAN'S VOICE I'M SAVED! MY HERO! \nTrevor flicks the REPLAY button. \nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT \nTrevor stares at the self-taken picture of him and his wife mugging at the camera. What is it that Kirsty is holding? \n", "test1_true": "The TV is on. Trevor flips through the channels. He stops on the Nature Channel. A goat is casually munching on some nuts and berries. \nANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (from TV) -at the dawning of the agrarian age goat's milk would be considered a suitable substitute for a mother's breast milk. And the sacrifice of a goat would appease an angry god and ensure a bountiful harvest. But in time the ritual would become associated with less hallowed purposes. \nHEADLINE: CHURCH DESECRATED WITH BLOOD OF GOAT, LAMB \nANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D) Goat's blood is said to hold supernatural properties linked to black magic. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D) In conjunction with the pentangle- the five pointed star- the spilling of goat's blood is considered to be either an aphrodisiac that can be used in demonic orgies, or a means by which a high priest may summon Satan himself. \nAN ILLUSTRATION of a goat with many eyes appears on the screen. \nANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D) (from TV) The Book of Revelations speaks of the anti-Christ as the beast with many eyes. For centuries illustrators have chosen a goat to represent this beast. \nHis eyes hurting too much to watch any more, Trevor turns the TV off. Out of sheer instinct he suddenly turns to look- \n-OUT HIS WINDOW: \nThe apartment across the street is lit. A STRANGE FIGURE is standing in the window. \nTrevor jumps up and rushes over to his window. He looks OUT at that same shadowy man he saw earlier. The man's face is still obscured and is still holding something in a blanket. Squinting Trevor is able to make out what it is: \nA SLEEPING BABY. The stranger pulls the baby's blanket over the baby's angelic face. Then the light in that apartment goes out abruptly. \nTrevor stares at the darkened window breathing heavily. Is the stranger still in there, watching Trevor in the dark? Trevor cannot tell. \nA SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR makes him flinch. \nTrevor goes to the door, opens it to find: \nTAWNY. Only now she's dressed in a skintight black rubber dress. She smiles accentuating a fresh coat of black lipstick. \nTAWNY Hey. Can I borrow something? \nTREVOR Uh... sure, Tawny... what? \nTAWNY You. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTawny grabs the back of his neck, pulling him to her as she kisses him deeply. She grabs his collar and pulls him out to the hallway. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nShe turns around, leading Trevor through the hall like a horse. A very confused horse. \nTREVOR Tawny? What's- what are you doing? \nTAWNY YOU! \nTrevor eyes her gorgeous body and decides not to resist quite so much. \nINT. TAWNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nTrevor leans against the counter, sipping at a glass of wine nervously. Right next to him, Tawny's at the stove, stirring a pot of something dark and bubbly. She looks up at him, smiling seductively. But Trevor's still a few lengths behind. \nTAWNY You okay? \nTREVOR I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually. \nTAWNY Really? \nTawny grabs Trevor's balls and he jumps away as if jolted by a cattle-prod. \nTAWNY (CONT'D) I'm kinda feeling nuts myself! \nTREVOR I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other? \nTAWNY (grinning) God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease... \nShe holds up a spoonful of what she's been stirring. It looks like stew. \n", "test1_id": 9, "test2_input": "BRET Frogurt guy's here. They're all out chocolate vanilla swirl or I'd have gotten you one. \nTREVOR I'm sure you would have. \nBret nods, tosses the frozen yogurt container out and sits down. \nBRET Hey if you're not doing anything I'd like to buy you a beer after work. Be just like old times. \nTREVOR What's the occasion? \nBRET I quit. Today's my last day. \nThis hits Trevor like a ton of bricks. \nINT. PUB - DAY \nThe place is practically empty. Bret and Trevor play darts and work on a pitcher of beer. Country Western plays on the jukebox. \nBRET I've got a better offer. More time off. A sort of career shift, more in the engineering line of work. \nTREVOR How much time off? \nBRET As much as he feels like. Its a much more pleasurable line of work. \nTREVOR As much as he likes? \nBRET Yahtzee. Were all in this together Trev. Trevor there are people who are doing exactly what we're doing but they don't need to wear a tie, punch a clock or have some tight assed supervisor breathing down their necks. Its all about the pleasure Trevor! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTREVOR So you're just packing it up just like that? \nBRET Almost that fast. I got a few loose ends to tie up first. Came into a shitload of money recently. I've always wanted to go to take a trip. We're just gonna walk into the airport and decide right then and there. \nTREVOR Yeah? You and who else? \nBRET Someone special. \nBret throws a dart with extra mph. It misses the board entirely and hits the wall. Trevor winces in pain suddenly. He touches his head and looks at his fingers. Fresh blood. \nFLASHBACK \nTrevor in the car in the water. Thrashing about, he bleeding from his head in the flashback as well. Where's Kristy? He looks in the passenger seat. She's gone. \nTrevor takes the cube from the man with the ring. He fumbles with the puzzle box in the darkness. \nCU box.   It starts to move. \nTrevor driving with Kristy, She's going down on him while he's driving. \nKIRSTY Okay pull over. \nTREVOR (looking at his watch) But... I thought... \nTrevor waits a moment to see if she's kidding. \nKIRSTY (through clenched teeth) PULL OVER NOW. \nThe car comes to a stop. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTrevor gets the goods while he watches himself in the rear view mirror. \nSomeone approaches. Trevor zips up, pulls Kristy up out of his lap. Its a cenobite. \nTrevor screams and opens the door of the car to make a frantic exit. He dive out onto the pavement and looks back. All is quiet. He's alone a quiet road. \nHe stands up and into an eerie world of slow motion . Trevor looks up the road and back to find- \nA beautiful vision of Allison walking toward him. Walking gracefully, she approaches Trevor. Raises her hand to his face. Trevor smiles, then slowly looks back towards the car. \n", "test2_true": "TREVOR Kristy noooo! \nAnd he makes a move toward the car, as the box comes to life. This stops Trevor in his tracks, and he looks toward Allison. Who is now PINHEAD. \nPINHEAD There is no reprieve for you. Not even in her. She's only a vision I'm afraid. \nTervors looks dumbfounded. \nPINHEAD (cont'd) \nThe truth hurts doesn't it? \nEND FLASHBACK \nINT. PUB - DAY \nTrevor raises his head from the bar. The beers are there but Bret is gone. Trevors stares at himself in the mirror opposite the bar. He looks like shit. He thinks hard about the flashback. \nOut the door he goes. \nEXT. PAY PHONE - NIGHT \n-Trevor's holding the phone up to his ear agitated beyond belief. He'd pace if he could. Instead he just fumes. \nTREVOR (into phone) Yes I'm trying to reach one of your interns... Allison Dormere...? She works in the emergency room there... What do you mean...? I just saw her today... Yes I'm sure she works there I've been in and out of that place five times in the last month...! Well good day to you too asshole! \n-CLOSE UP on Trevor's hand searching through the D's in the white pages. He slams the book shut in frustration. \n-He's on the phone again. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) No such listing...? Could you at least tell me IF she has an unlisted number...? What do you mean there are no Dormeres at all there have to be...! WELL LOOK AGAIN! (a beat, more timidly) H-hello? \nTrevor SLAMS the phone down and touches his head again. He looks at his hand. The blood is gone. But the headache is back. Its crippling at this point. He's at his wits end. He reaches into his pocket and finds Pages card. Maybe as a last resort? \nTHE PHONE RINGS. IT RINGS AGAIN. Trevor presses his palm against his eye. Trevor picks up the phone. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) (into phone) Hello? \nWIMPERING VOICE (from phone) Goodbye... \nTREVOR Kirsty? \nWIMPERING VOICE You miserable sonofabitch! \nDIAL TONE. \nEXT. SAGE'S BUILDING - NIGHT \nTrevor is out of breath as he walks up to the last resort. The entrance to Sage's building. The front door is locked. He presses a three digit code on the alarm box. RING. RING. The phone picks up. He's deperate. \nSAGE'S VOICE Hello? \nTREVOR Sage it's me Trevor. You've got to help me. \nINT. SAGE'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nTrevor's head hits the pillow on the acupuncture table. \nTREVOR The feeling is very distinct. It's like somebody stuck a shard of glass through my eye and it's embedded halfway into my brain. \nSage nods, patient look on her face. \nSAGE Trevor your body has been completely healed. All the nerve endings have repaired themselves. If there is any pain in your head it's... in your head. \nTREVOR Jeez it's getting awful crowded in there. \nSAGE You are physically better. It's your soul that still hurts. \nSage grabs a bunch of needles from the table. \nSAGE (CONT'D) My teacher told me once there's a puncture point on your body that can lock your soul within it, even after you're dead. So that when you die you're trapped inside your body, watching it corrode for all eternity. \nTREVOR Look, whatever your Marharagi, told you, forget. You've got to get this fuckin pain to stop. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test2_id": 10, "test3_input": "THE TV SCREEN DISSOLVES to Trevor in bed with yet another woman... and another... and another... \nBACK TO: \nINT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nThat fatal BELL begins to TOLL. With each peel the walls of the morgue shakes. It's walls begin to rumble and crack. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPINHEAD Even a mind as narcissistic as yours must have wondered: What unspeakable acts was your wife committing behind YOUR back? \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \nLOW ANGLE UP AT: Kirsty, Trevor's lovely wife, raising a rock above her. \nKIRSTY (to camera) Goodbye you miserable sonofabitch! \nAnd SLAMMING a rock down on us. \nbacK TO: \nINT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nTREVOR What's under that sheet...? \nPINHEAD You probably don't remember the night we played. Your first year as husband and wife. \nflASH BACK: \nINT. TREVOR'S APT., BEDROOM - NIGHT \nTrevor and a very pregnant Kirsty sit on their bed, passing the cube back and forth. Trevor's the one with the magic touch. The cube begins to open in his hands. Kirsty's eyes light up as she watches... \nPINHEAD (V.O.) It must have seemed like we were uninvited guests crashing your little celebration. \nON the walls as shadows begin to flail in pain and panic. OFF SCREEN SCREAMS are heard as blood begins to shower the walls of the bedroom. \nPINHEAD (V.O.) But someone was expecting us Trevor. And everything went according to plan. \nbaCK TO: \nINT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nPINHEAD We were about to come for Kirsty. When we were offered a deal. We don't usually consider bargains but this one was too good to pass up. A tribute to the resourcefulness of a parent hellbent on protecting its spawn. The deal we were offered was this: three more souls in exchange for the life of the unborn child inside Kirsty. The three souls had already been picked out. Needless to say we were very impressed. \nThe lights dim. Drawers behind Pinhead begin to open. We see Gwen's body, Tawny's, Sage's, Bonnie's. \nPINHEAD (CONT'D) Two of your favorite companions, most supple and delicious as you already know. And the man you had at one time conspired to kill Kirsty with. Until you found out she was with child. \nsmASH CUT TO: \nQUICK IMAGES of Gwen, Tawny, and Bret being rent to pieces by the Cenobites, SCREAMING in vain. \nINT. MORGUE - NIGHT \nPINHEAD (CONT'D) They were all real screamers too. We had a blast. And there was one more. You've seen many things you wished you hadn't. Many nightmares from which you never awoke. They were all clues in our little puzzle. Can you guess now Trevor? Can you guess the fifth soul chosen for us to torment in this little agreement? \nThe lights flicker overhead, reddening with each strobe. Hundreds of those little sewer monsters come slithering out of the cracks in the walls, racing toward Trevor. He doesn't care. \nTREVOR WHAT'S UNDER THE SHEET? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nPINHEAD (smiling) Welcome to the worst nightmare of them all, Trevor. Reality. \nPinhead grabs the sheet and whips it back. \nTrevor's jaw drops in disbelief. \nIT'S TREVOR'S BODY. It is blue, bloated and mutilated. The corpse's skull has a massive crack in it. \n", "test3_true": "flASH BACK: \nINT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nKirsty sits across from Lange, who slides the cube across the desk towards her. \nLANGE Open this and your problem will disappear forever. And no one will ever suspect you. \nINT. CAR - DAY \nKirsty drives. Trevor sits in the passenger seat, in the same position we saw him in during his last flashback. Only now it is clear the reason his head is resting on the baby blanket is to keep his brains from spilling out his split open skull. ON KIRSTY'S HAND holding his. It is now covered with blood. \nKIRSTY Shhh it's okay. \nEXT. BRIDGE - DAY \nThe car goes off the bridge landing in the water. Kirsty's head breaks the surface. She watches the car sink into the river. \nbaCK TO: \nINT. MORGUE \nTrevor stares at his own dead body in utter disbelief. The sewer monsters begin crawling up his legs. Pinhead smiles. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) NOOO!! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe scream ECHOES over Trevor's dead self, which seems so tranquil in contrast. HOLD on the corpse. After a beat the bells stop, as does the rumbling and the cracking. The lights brighten. Serenity. Then: \nKIRSTY'S VOICE Yes. Yes that's him. \nREVERSE ANGLE on Kirsty looking down at the corpse wiping her eyes. She looks over to the other side of the body where Trevor and Pinhead had been standing. Where now DETECTIVE LANGE and the coroner DR. AMBROSE had been standing. \nThe two gentlemen look at each other. \nLANGE Well I guess that's it then. Thank you Mrs. Gooding I realize that must have been tough. \nLange escorts Kirsty to the door. They EXIT but not before Kirsty gives her late husband a parting glance. Ambrose covers Trevor's body and looks OFF CAMERA. \nDR. AMBROSE Alrighty. Let's get started folks. \nREVERSE on two other DOCTORS who are busying themselves collecting instrument. ALLISON and SAGE. They walk over to Trevor's body and get to work. Sage sticks a needle in Trevor's arm. \nSAGE Collecting 40ccs of serum... \nAMBROSE Examining cranial fracture... \nAllison at his side, Ambrose checks the wound on Trevor's head, pauses to look inside Trevor's eyes. \nTREVOR'S POV: Ambrose closing the eyelid again. \nAMBROSE (CONT'D) Checking oral cavity for blockage... \nAmbrose opens Trevor's mouth. \nAMBROSE (CONT'D) And we have a winner... \nAmbrose pulls a long black dead lamprey out of Trevor's mouth. Looks at the slippery creature for a moment. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nALLISON Looks like an eel of some kind. \nAMBROSE Guess it was murder after all. \nSAGE Yeah all we need is the eel's motive. \nAllison holds out a large freezer bag, into which Ambrose dumps the dead lamprey. \nALLISON I still don't get it. He's been missing for almost eight months. But this body hasn't been dead more than twenty four hours. \n", "test3_id": 11}

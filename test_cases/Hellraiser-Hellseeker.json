{"test1_input": "The rest is a blur... \n... Trevor loses control of the steering wheel... Kirsty SCREAMS... Their car skids from one side of the bridge to the other-careening toward the guardrail- SMASH! \nThe car is plummeting toward the river below. Trevor and Kirsty brace themselves. The car hits the surface... \nINT. RIVER, UNDERWATER - DAY \nTrevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He breaks the surface and gasps for air. Getting his bearings he see the car bobbing on the surface, the current is separating him from his wife. \nTreading water, he looks out at the car and there she is trapped inside... \nKirsty \nStill belted to her seat. Her eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, sinking fast... Kristy pounds the window with her hands, trying to get out. She's trapped. \nApparently giving in, she presses a hand against the windshield just before the car disappears under the surface... \nEXT. SHORE - DAY \nTrevor paddles hard to the shore. Exhausted, he crawls onto the shore underneath the bridge they just jumped. \nTrevor stands trying to process what just happened in the last fifteen seconds. He screams out for his wife, and to what has just happened. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTREVOR Kristy! Kristy! \nTrevor drops to his knee's in distress. \nTREVOR (cont'd) Oh my God, Kristy! Please Kristy. (frantically) I'm so sorry, Kristy. \nHe hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of the bashed-up guardrail from the bridge has just snapped off and is sailing right down toward him- \nTREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM \nWHITE LIGHT FLOODS HIS VISION... \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nTrevor's eyes blink open, darting left and right. He is on a bed, his head bandaged. \nAN ANGULAR NURSE ENTERS the room, walking up to Trevor's bed. \nTREVOR Where is she...? Where's Kirsty? \nThe Nurse grabs Trevor's right arm and straps it to the side of the bed. She isn't exactly one of God's gentler creatures. \nTREVOR Hey, what are you- \nShe moves to Trevor's legs, strapping them down as well, then his other arm. \nBy now SEVERAL SURGEONS ENTER the room, features obscured by surgical masks. \nThe Nurse fastens a clamp around Trevor's head, attaches it to the bed. \nTrevor is completely discombobulated. The surgeons gather behind Trevor's bed. \nCLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE as he struggles to see what's happening back there but it's useless. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nHe cannot move a muscle. He hears a sickening SAWING noise and his eyes bulge in horror. \nWIDE as the doctors calmly lift Trevor's freshly sawed cranium from his head exposing his brain. The CHIEF SURGEON- a large unshaven man with magnifying lens alreaday in place make his eyes enormous and his face grotesquely distorted. He walks up, presented with a tray full of evenly arranged pins. He cranks up the magnification of his lenes which make his eyes appear even larger. Though no one speaks his name his name tag reads Dr. Barker. \nTREVOR What are you people doing?! \nThe Chief Surgeon takes one of the pins and gently pushes into a Trevor's frontal lobe. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) What's happening to-! \n", "test1_true": "CHIEF SURGEON As you can see I just accessed the speech center, temporarily shutting down all verbal ability. \nAs the Chief Surgeon continues he takes several more pins off the tray. \nCHIEF SURGEON (CONT'D) The goal is find the exact point in the brain where moral decisions are made, the place where right and wrong is distinguished. In exploring this Morality Center I will most likely be triggering memories, disrupting the unconscious. Our patient may experience some distress during the proceedings but they are not due to pain. It is merely our patient- recalling his past... \nChief Surgeon slips another pin into Trevors exposed brain. \nCHIEF SURGEON (cont'd) As he was thrown into the lake, where the beast and the false prophet had been thrown. \nThe Chief Surgeon voice lowers and his eyes turn black. The eye magification no at a hideous level, showing jet black eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCHIEF SURGEON (cont'd) Where you will be tormented day and night for ever and ever. (rev.20:10) \nTrevor looks at the frowning nurse who is watching over him. Chief Surgeon sticks a needle into another spot on Trevor's brain. \nTREVOR'S POV: The nurse is suddenly a pale gargoyle with blackened eyes. \nTrevor opens his mouth to scream and- \n-IN A BURST OF WHITE LIGHT, AN ANGELIC WOMAN is now standing before him. She is bathed in a haze of white light. \nANGELIC WOMAN Well? What do say Trevor? Que pasa? \nTrevor relaxes. His bindings are gone. The gargoyle nurse is gone. The surgeons are gone. And his brain is sitting safely within his inviolated skull, upon which now sit a few electrodes. The bandage is no longer there. \nBut from his pain wracked expression we know the pain in his head is still very real. He reaches for his head, makes sure its all intact. \nTREVOR Where do I start? \nANGELIC WOMAN How's the old noggin? Any change in the intensity? \nShe touches him gently. \nANGELIC WOMAN (cont'd) Can you describe the pains? \nTrevor looks up. The angelic woman smiles back at him. She's in scrubs, a stethoscope dangling from her neck. Trevor winces. \nTREVOR I'm not sure. How about a jackhammer in the Occipital lobe? \nShe picks up a pad and scribbles something on it. Trevor notices she's wearing a nameplate. Dr. ALLISON DORMERE. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nTREVOR Are you a dream too? \nALLISON Still hallucinating as well. Hmm... \nTREVOR What just happened to me anyway? It looked like a dream but it felt like reality. \nALLISON It's the morphine Trevor. You're on so much of it, you could be asleep and dreaming even with your eyes wide open. \nTerevors quickly recalls the accident. Fearing the worst. \nTREVOR Where's Kirsty? Where's my wife? \nALLISON (confused) Your wife...? \nAN OLDER DOCTOR walks in. AMBROSE. He gives Trevor an icy look, then looks at Trevor's chart. \nALLISON (to Ambrose) Still a little hazy. He's still in pain too, even after the morphine. I recommend we admit him. At least for another day... (leaning in, sotto) He just asked for his wife... \nAMBROSE Well I can't find any abnormalities. I think we're ready for discharge. \nALLISON But, Dr. Ambrose- \nAMBROSE (looking up at Trevor) I think it's time to ween you off these painkillers too. Wouldn't want you to develop a dependency to them. You might do things like come to the hospital for no reason other than to get a fix, wouldn't you? \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_id": 9, "test2_input": "GWEN Oh I see. That again. Trevor? I realize it must be hard. But Christ how long does it take someone to move on? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nTREVOR That was cold... \nGWEN No, making another woman compete with someone who's been dead eight months. That's cold. \nThis goes through Trevor like a shot. EIGHT MONTHS! \nHere we go- Dolly in zoom out! In Close up of Trevor we... \nFLASHBACK \nQUICK FLASHES of Kirsty's hand pounding on the windshield, the car sinking into the lake, a quick cut of a dark figure with a bright ring, and shots of two naked bodies slamming against each other in climax course through Trevor's mind. Finally, over the images of erotica we hear Gwens voice as one of the characters. \nGWEN (cont'd) Yeah, Trevor thats it. Thats it. \nAnd back in the real world, Trevor is now locking lips with a very ready Gwen. His hand is up her skirt. He stops abruptly and pulls back. \nTREVOR I'm sorry Gwen. I don't know what's happening to me. (zipping up) I think it's the painkillers, really. \nGwen rolls her eyes. She re-adjusts her self and now getting a little pissy. She's heard this one before. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) They mess with my head. Yesterday gets blacked out and a memory from months ago is played out in vivid technicolor. Like the accident just happened you know? \nGwen softens up. Trevor is so earnest, so vulnerable. \nGWEN Why don't you let me take you out tonight? I promise to make it the most memorable night of your life. \nShe kisses him. He braces himself. She grabs his butt, then goes for the door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nGWEN (CONT'D) Pick you up round seven. And Gooding? Get some fucking work done. \nINT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY \nTrevor relentlessly crunches numbers at his computer. He pauses a moment to stretch and rubs his eyes. A PING from his computer announces he has an INTEROFFICE MEMO- FILE ATTACHED. Trevor goes to the mailbox on his screen, clicks. \nUp comes a jpeg slideshow. Each picture is of Gwen dressed in a piece of sexy lingerie. The caption underneath reads WORK HARDER. Looking around his cubicle, he then takes another look at the jpeg. Trevor stands up in the cubicle and we see him peer the outer office looking for Gwen. He sits back down. Embarrassed Trevor closes the memo at least for now. \nTREVOR'S PHONE RINGS. Startleing him(and us). He picks it up. \nTREVOR (into phone) You got Trevor. \nMAN'S VOICE (from phone) Trevor hi this is Detective Lange from homicide. It's about your wife. \nPush in on to a bewildered Trevor. \nINT. LANGE'S OFFICE, HOMICIDE - DAY \nIt is a dank crumbling room. A place where sunlight is not welcome. DETECTIVE LANGE, a handsome graying gentleman who's plagued with a chronic case of post nasal drip, sits at his desk. \nTrevor sits across from him. Behind Trevor is another empty desk. \nAs Lange speaks he SNIFFS wetly every so often. \nLANGE (to Trevor) Thanks for coming down Mr. Gooding. Has your head healed okay by now? \nTREVOR Where's my wife? \nLANGE Okay then. Here's the scoop. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nLange takes out nasal drops and squeezes some in each nostril as he speaks. \nLANGE (CONT'D) (cont'd) We still haven't been able to locate your the body in that river. And missing persons turned up some evidence that qualified the disappearance as foul play. \n", "test2_true": "LANGE For one thing there were no skid marks on that bridge, the tires were all intact, from what we could tell, nothing wrong internally with the vehicle either. Like the car had been driven off the bridge intentionally. \nTREVOR It should all in the report. I told you guys everything. She was giving birth in the fucking car. She grabbed the wheel and I lost control. \nLANGE I did read that, yes. (flipping through the report) What hospital were you going to? I mean the Lodovico Street Bridge isn't exactly on the way to Mercy General. \nTrevor looks numb, unable to answer.    Lange poker faced, keeps looking through the reoport. \nLANGE (CON'T) (cont'd) Listen we really are at a stalemate here until we find the body itself. Is there any way you did not tell missing persons everything that happened just before that accident? \nTREVOR Why wouldn't I tell you everything? (impatiently) Look, I've been fully cooperative... (quick to add) ... to my recollection. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLANGE I'm sorry Mr. Gooding, I meant no disrespect. I'm just doing my job here, OK? I mean between your head injury and the fact that you are on very strong pain medication, you might not be remembering a few details about the crash which might help us here. \nLange takes a deep hit of the nasal spray. \nLANGE (cont'd) What you're recalling could be a fabrication you've made up about it. Do you follow? \nCLOSE ON TREVOR'S FACE as he wrestles with this notion. \nFLASH BACK: \nINT. TREVOR'S CAR - DAY \nKirsty's eyes are closed. She is motionless. Trevor tries to look at her while watching the road at the same time. \nTREVOR Kirsty. Jesus, wake up! \nThis time she doesn't wake up. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nThe car fishtails. Trevor loses control and the car skids from one side of the bridge to the other- careening toward the guardrail- SMASH! \nThe car is plummeting toward the river below... The car hits the surface... \nINT. UNDERWATER - DAY \nTrevor flounders through a disoriented flurry of bubbles. He swims up to the passenger door and tries the handle. It won't give. Unable to breathe Trevor finally swims up... \nEXT. SHORE - DAY \nHe breaks the surface and crawls onto the shore... \nHe looks out at the car to where she should be trapped inside... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTrevors eyes are wide with desperation, breath quickening, The car is sinking fast... \nHe looks at the car and calls out, but there is no Kristy insight. \nThe car disappears under the surface... \nTrevor hears something from above and looks up. A chunk of the bashed-up guardrail is sailing right down toward him- \nTREVOR BLACKS OUT JUST AS THE THING HITS HIM \nINT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nLANGE Mr. Gooding? You still in there? \nTrevor blinks and looks around him. Lange is sitting just where they were when he saw him last. Only now there's a very wary look on his face. Whoa. \nTREVOR Uhh. Yes detective, sorry. Just trying to recollect, you know? \nLange nods. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) Okay. From what I remember now, maybe my wife was thrown from the car when it hit the water. Maybe she wasn't trapped inside. \n", "test2_id": 10, "test3_input": "TREVOR Uh thanks this looks a little important. Could you let the folks upstairs know I'll be late? \nRECEPTIONIST For you bubbalicious? (winking) I'd lay across a bed of nails. \nTrevor walks back OUT and the receptionist watches him go. Another female employee walks by staring at Trevor. She looks at the receptionist and they both nod in agreement. \nRECEPTIONIST (CONT'D) You know it girl. That ass is a three- hummer baby. Mmm-mmm-mmm. \nINT. LANGE'S OFFICE - DAY \nSame office only Trevor is sitting at the other desk across from a hawklike MAN who is playing with a yoyo. This is GIVENS. If good cop bad cop is the scheme here, he's the latter. \nTREVOR I'm sorry. I still... I don't understand how this is a homicide case. I mean nobody was murdered here... Her body's been missing for I don't know how long now and... \nGIVENS What did you just say? \nTREVOR I said she's been missing for- \nGIVENS No. No you said HER BODY's been missing. \nTREVOR What's the difference? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGIVENS Last time anybody saw this woman she was alive. You seem to certain she's dead. \nTREVOR (tearing up) I saw her drowning inside the car, detective. \nGIVENS I read up on you, man. You're a smart guy aren't you? I mean with numbers. Right? \nTREVOR You could say that. \nGIVENS Zero's a number right? \nTREVOR As in one minus one equals zero yes. Where are you going with this? \nGIVENS How many zeros was your wife worth? \nBrow furrowing, Trevor stands up. \nTREVOR I need to talk to my attorney. Now. \nGivens pushes his phone toward Trevor, who takes it and dials furiously. Givens remains poker-faced. Trevor dials a number. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) (into phone) Yes I need LARRY ELLIS' office please. \nHe says the lawyer's name like it's supposed to intimidate Givens. He couldn't care less. \nTREVOR (CONT'D) (a beat) Yeah this is Trevor Gooding I need to speak with Larry... Trevor...? Kirsty Gooding's husband...? (another beat) I see do you know when he'll be out that meeting? Fine I'll uh... call back then... Okay you give him the message and he'll call me that's great. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nWith that Trevor hangs up the phone and EXITS the office. Givens BUSTS OUT LAUGHING. \nINT. TREVOR'S CUBICLE - DAY \nTrevor types bitterly on the computer crunching numbers like a madman. \nBRET I don't know what pissed you off but it's nice to see you getting the job done for a change. \nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT \nTrevor plays his videogame with venom. The cries of his kills emanate from the TV, building to a crescendo. Finally we hear a WOMAN'S VOICE come from the TV. \nWOMAN'S VOICE I'M SAVED! MY HERO! \nTrevor flicks the REPLAY button. \nINT. TREVOR'S APT. - NIGHT \nTrevor stares at the self-taken picture of him and his wife mugging at the camera. What is it that Kirsty is holding? \n", "test3_true": "The TV is on. Trevor flips through the channels. He stops on the Nature Channel. A goat is casually munching on some nuts and berries. \nANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (from TV) -at the dawning of the agrarian age goat's milk would be considered a suitable substitute for a mother's breast milk. And the sacrifice of a goat would appease an angry god and ensure a bountiful harvest. But in time the ritual would become associated with less hallowed purposes. \nHEADLINE: CHURCH DESECRATED WITH BLOOD OF GOAT, LAMB \nANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D) Goat's blood is said to hold supernatural properties linked to black magic. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D) In conjunction with the pentangle- the five pointed star- the spilling of goat's blood is considered to be either an aphrodisiac that can be used in demonic orgies, or a means by which a high priest may summon Satan himself. \nAN ILLUSTRATION of a goat with many eyes appears on the screen. \nANNNOUNCER'S VOICE (CONT'D) (from TV) The Book of Revelations speaks of the anti-Christ as the beast with many eyes. For centuries illustrators have chosen a goat to represent this beast. \nHis eyes hurting too much to watch any more, Trevor turns the TV off. Out of sheer instinct he suddenly turns to look- \n-OUT HIS WINDOW: \nThe apartment across the street is lit. A STRANGE FIGURE is standing in the window. \nTrevor jumps up and rushes over to his window. He looks OUT at that same shadowy man he saw earlier. The man's face is still obscured and is still holding something in a blanket. Squinting Trevor is able to make out what it is: \nA SLEEPING BABY. The stranger pulls the baby's blanket over the baby's angelic face. Then the light in that apartment goes out abruptly. \nTrevor stares at the darkened window breathing heavily. Is the stranger still in there, watching Trevor in the dark? Trevor cannot tell. \nA SUDDEN KNOCKING AT THE DOOR makes him flinch. \nTrevor goes to the door, opens it to find: \nTAWNY. Only now she's dressed in a skintight black rubber dress. She smiles accentuating a fresh coat of black lipstick. \nTAWNY Hey. Can I borrow something? \nTREVOR Uh... sure, Tawny... what? \nTAWNY You. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTawny grabs the back of his neck, pulling him to her as she kisses him deeply. She grabs his collar and pulls him out to the hallway. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nShe turns around, leading Trevor through the hall like a horse. A very confused horse. \nTREVOR Tawny? What's- what are you doing? \nTAWNY YOU! \nTrevor eyes her gorgeous body and decides not to resist quite so much. \nINT. TAWNY'S KITCHEN - NIGHT \nTrevor leans against the counter, sipping at a glass of wine nervously. Right next to him, Tawny's at the stove, stirring a pot of something dark and bubbly. She looks up at him, smiling seductively. But Trevor's still a few lengths behind. \nTAWNY You okay? \nTREVOR I'm, uh, not sure... Feeling kind of weird actually. \nTAWNY Really? \nTawny grabs Trevor's balls and he jumps away as if jolted by a cattle-prod. \nTAWNY (CONT'D) I'm kinda feeling nuts myself! \nTREVOR I've never said this to a woman before but can't we talk a little bit before grabbing at each other? \nTAWNY (grinning) God. Sometimes you can be such an animal. Other times you are the ultimate tease... \nShe holds up a spoonful of what she's been stirring. It looks like stew. \n", "test3_id": 11}

PAUL You know, Annie, this book never would have survived without you. When it gets to new York, there will be a big auction, and whatever it brings we can split. (pause) God knows you're entitled to it. 
ANNIE Oh, Paul. This isn't about money. It's about decency and purity. It's about God's values. 
PAUL You're right. You're right. I don't know what I was thinking. I'll tell you what. It doesn't have to be published. Nobody ever has to see it. I'll just keep it for myself. No one will ever have to know it exists. 
ANNIE As long as it does exist, your mind won't ever be free. I think you should light the match, Paul. 
There is a long silence. PAUL doesn't move. 
ANNIE Can't you see it's what God wants? 
She's holding the can of lighter fluid in her hand as she speaks and absentmindedly flicks a few drops of the fluid on the bed. 
ANNIE You're so brilliant. I would think you'd certainly be able to see that. (More drops fall on the bed) We're put on this earth to help people, Paul. Like I'm trying to help you. 
PAUL watches as the fluid continues to drop on the bed. 
ANNIE Please let me help you. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL. His hands shaking. Almost robot-like, he strikes one. It flames. 
ANNIE You're doing the right thing, Paul. 
CUT TO: 
THE BARBECUE, as Paul's hand appears, drops the match on the fluid-soaked manuscript. For a moment--nothing-- 
--and then, KABOOM, the goddamn thing practically explodes and 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, staring, dazed, and as the flames leap higher, 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, suddenly scared and startled at the heat and the size of the flames and the full baking heat and 
ANNIE (crying out) Goodness! 
CUT TO: 
THE BARBECUE. The sound is LOUDER as the flames leap up and now charred bits of paper begin floating upward and 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, watching, as more bits of paper rise. 
ANNIE Goodness--Goodness--Oh, my gracious-- 
And she starts trying to catch them. 
CUT TO: 
A PIECE OF BURNING PAPER in midair, floating against the gauzy curtain, and for a moment it looks like the curtain will catch fire and 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, panicked, racing out of the room, going "Goodness, heavens to Betsy"-- 
CUT TO: 
THE BARBECUE, and what's left of the book. 
CUT TO: 
PAUL, and he cannot take his eyes off the disaster. 
CUT TO: 
ANNIE, hurrying back in, carrying a big bucket, slopping water as she lifts the bucket. 
CUT TO: 
THE LAST of the manuscript as the bucket of water is tossed onto it--there's hissing and steam and as the steam clears it all looks now like a log in a brackish pond. 
ANNIE Well, isn't that an oogy mess? 
As she starts to wheel the barbecue out, suddenly there is a new and different sound as we

PAUL, head turning toward the window.

Nash checks Cobb's left wrist: above his watch, tape holds TWO THIN YELLOW TUBES in place. Nash looks at Cobb's watch- THE SECOND HAND CRAWLS UNNATURALLY SLOWLY. 
Nash follows the tubes to a SILVER BRIEFCASE at Arthur's feet: ARTHUR IS ASLEEP in an armchair. Tubes connect the briefcase to Arthur's wrist. 
Nash follows another set of tubes from the briefcase to where they pass under the door to the bedroom. Through the crack of the door, Nash sees SAITO ASLEEP on the bed, tubes running to his wrist. BOOM- a closer EXPLOSION, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. BULLET TRAIN COMPARTMENT - DAY (FEELS LIKE DIFFERENT TIME) 
Nash, ASLEEP. Head ROCKING AGAINST THE WINDOW as the train BUMPS OVER A ROUGH PIECE OF TRACK. 
A Japanese Man, TODASHI (18) watches Nash nervously. He checks Nash's wrist: TWO YELLOW TUBES CONNECT NASH WITH THREE OTHER SLEEPING MEN IN THE COMPARTMENT: COBB, ARTHUR, SAITO. 
Todashi checks his watch: THE SECOND HAND TICKS IN REAL TIME. Another TRAIN PASSES in the opposite direction with a MIGHTY WHUMP- Todashi's eyes FLY to Nash's sleeping face- 
NASH JERKS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE TRAIN, and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. FILTHY BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Another EXPLOSION- Nash CHECKS the sleeping Cobb and we- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROOFTOP TERRACES, JAPANESE CASTLE - NIGHT 
A LOW TREMOR RUMBLES THROUGH THE CASTLE. Cobb and Arthur steady themselves against the wooden rail. Several TILES and pieces of MASONRY fall. Below them a BLACK SEA churns. Other GUESTS wander the massive terraces. 
ARTHUR Saito knows. He's playing with us. 
COBB I can get it here. The information's in the safe- he looked right at it when I mentioned secrets. 
Arthur nods. Then spots someone over Cobb's shoulder. 
ARTHUR What's she doing here, Cobb? 
Cobb turns to see a beautiful woman, elegantly dressed, staring out at the sea. This is MAL. Cobb watches her. 
COBB You just get to your room. I'll take care of the rest. 
ARTHUR See that you do. We're here to work. 
Arthur brushes past Mal, shaking his head. She nears Cobb. Looks out at the DROP. The WIND WHIPS HER HAIR- 
MAL If I jumped, would I survive? 
COBB With a clean dive, perhaps. Mal, why are you here? 
She turns to look at him. Amused. 
MAL I thought you might be missing me... 
She smiles. He leans in, mesmerized. 
COBB I am. But I can't trust you anymore. 
She stares up at him, inviting. 
MAL So what? 
INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER 
Mal sips champagne as she studies a painting by Francis Bacon. 
MAL Looks like Arthur's taste. 
Cobb is looking down through the window at the GUARDS patrolling the castle at ground level. 
COBB Actually, Mr. Saito is partial to postwar British painters. 
He turns to Mal, donning a pair of black leather gloves. 
COBB Would you sit down? 
Mal lowers herself gracefully into a leather wingback chair. Cobb approaches, pulls out a length of BLACK ROPE and kneels at Mal's feet. She looks down at him. 
MAL Tell me... 
Cobb TIES the rope around the CHAIR LEGS. 
MAL Do the children miss me? 
Cobb pauses. He lets his gloved fingers lightly touch Mal's ankle. He looks up at her. 
COBB You can't imagine. 
Mal looks away, uncomfortable. Cobb gets to his feet, letting out the rope as he moves back to the window. 
MAL What're you doing? 
Cobb tosses the rope out- 
COBB Getting some air. 
He tugs on the rope, testing. The weight of the chair, with Mal on it, holds. 
COBB Stay seated. Please. 
And with that, he JUMPS. Mal considers the open window. 
EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb RAPPELS down the wall, darting past windows. He stops at a particular one. Gets out a glass cutter- 
Suddenly he starts DROPPING- 
INT. BEDROOM SUITE, JAPANESE CASTLE - CONTINUOUS 
The EMPTY CHAIR SLIDES across the floor- WEDGES under the window- 
EXT. JAPANESE CASTLE WALL - CONTINUOUS 
Cobb JOLTS to a stop 15 ft. lower. He looks up at the bedroom window. Shakes his head. Starts climbing back. 
INT. KITCHEN, JAPANESE CASTLE - MOMENTS LATER 
Cobb drops silently from the window into the darkened kitchen. He pulls a PISTOL from his belt, screwing a SILENCER onto the barrel as he GLIDES across the room.

Charlie nods grimly. 
Featuring Gandhi and Ba. Gandhi, smiling, goes on the tips of his toes to get a better view. Ba grabs him desperately. 
BA Please, God, no! 
Featuring Charlie. He looks around at the rest of the passengers on the roof, their bundles and baskets clutched beside them. Their poverty is appalling, but they are all smiling at him, a sense of gaiety made in part by his Englishman's participation in their experience. They must shout over the train. 
SECOND INDIAN (grinning) Are you Christian, Sahib? 
CHARLIE (nods) Yes, yes, I'm a Christian. 
SECOND INDIAN (proudly) I know a Christian. (Charlie acknowledges it politely.) She drinks blood. 
Charlie stares at him in surprise. 
SECOND INDIAN (explaining -- obvious) The blood of Christ -- every Sunday! 
He is nodding, smiling, expecting Charlie's understanding. And Charlie gives it -- somewhat bleakly. Suddenly 
GANDHI'S VOICE (alarmed) Charlie!! 
The Indians turn. Charlie turns. 
TRAIN AND TUNNEL - EXTERIOR - DAY 
Resume Charlie and the Indians. 
FIRST INDIAN It's all right, Sahib! Very safe -- bend -- bend! 
All the Indians are crouching. Charlie closes his eyes ruefully -- he's had better ideas than this -- and he gets as flat as he can. 
TRAIN AND TUNNEL - EXTERIOR - DAY 
The train, with passengers clinging to the sides and riding on the top, steams into the tunnel, its whistle sounding. 
THE TUNNEL 
Black. A glimmer of light, through steam, the whistle echoing. 
INDIAN'S VOICE Pray to God, Sahib! Now is when it is best to be Hindu! 
Close shot. Charlie. In a flash of steamy light, staring wide-eyed at the Indian. 
Black, and sudden silence. 
AND WE DISSOLVE THROUGH TO: 
CONVENTION TENT - INTERIOR - DAY 
High. Coming into focus is a lighted platform, and as the scene becomes clearer we see figures on the platform and the banner which reads INDIAN NATIONAL CONGRESS, and we hear the emotional voice of Jinnah at the microphone. 
JINNAH (gradually fading in) We were asked for toleration. We were asked for patience. Some gave it and some did not. Well, their war is over! And those of us who supported it, and those of us who refused must forget our differences! 
The camera has been moving in; now it jumps to Jinnah in close shot and intercuts with the impact of his fervid delivery on the audience. 
JINNAH And there can be no excuses from the British now! India wants Home Rule! India demands Home Rule!! 
And the audience cheers him. Newspaper cameramen crowded around the platform photograph him. Patel comes forward from the back of the platform, clapping. He is chairing the Congress. Jinnah bows, taking his notes, gesturing to the auditorium. A man made for the spotlight, a man loving the spotlight. 
At last he moves back to his place on the platform. Nehru clasps his hand in congratulation. Others crowd around him. And fleetingly, just in the edge of picture, we see Gandhi -- again, the only one in an Indian tunic -- sitting at the end of the second row on the platform. He is just watching the flood of enthusiasm for Jinnah. 
Featuring Patel approaching the microphone, stilling the house with upraised hands. 
PATEL And let no one question that Mr. Jinnah speaks not just for the Muslims -- but for all India! 
And again the audience cheers and applauds his little coda. He raises his hands, stilling them again. 
PATEL And now I'm going to introduce to you a man whose writings we are all becoming familiar with... a man who stood high in the esteem of our beloved Professor Gokhale... a man whose accomplishment in South Africa will always be remembered. Mr. Mohandas Gandhi. 
Gandhi has already started to come toward the podium. He is greeted with mild applause, but already the convention is performing like a convention now that the spell of Jinnah's major speech has dissipated. As Gandhi reaches the podium, Patel gestures him to it. 
PATEL (politely) Your journal has made a great impact. 
Gandhi nods to him and acknowledges the residue of applause. 
GANDHI I am flattered by Mr. Patel (His grin.) I would be even more flattered if what he said were true. 
He means about the journal. 
Patel has wandered back toward the others, his mind already on them. But he has half heard Gandhi's comment and turns -- a smile, a politician's flexibility -- 
PATEL (loudly; he is away from the mike) But it's true! I -- I read it... often. 
Again Gandhi grins -- and takes glasses from his sleeve. This is the first time we have seen them. He has one slip of paper with notes on it which he has put on the podium. He puts his glasses on and faces the convention. 
GANDHI Since I returned from South Africa, I have traveled over much of India. And I know I could travel many more years and still only see a small part of it. 
On the platform, the whispered politics go on. On the floor of the convention, some listen, some talk of other things. 
GANDHI ...and yet already I know what we say here means nothing to the masses of our country. 
Nehru has turned, having caught that last remark. He touches Patel on the shoulder "Listen." 
GANDHI Here we make speeches for each other -- and those English liberal magazines that may grant us a few lines. 
And now they are beginning to pay attention on the floor of the hall too. 
GANDHI But the people of India are untouched. Their politics are confined to bread and salt. 
Jinnah too is listening now -- aloofly, challengingly. 
GANDHI Illiterate they may be, but they are not blind. They see no reason to give their loyalty to rich and powerful men who simply want to take over the role of the British in the name of freedom. 
There is dissent on the floor and on the platform -- but it is muttered and English "polite." Gandhi goes on. 
GANDHI This Congress tells the world it represents India. My brothers, India is seven hundred thousand "villages" not a few hundred lawyers in Delhi and Bombay. Until we stand in the fields with the millions who toil each day under the hot sun, we will not represent India -- nor will we ever be able to challenge the British as one nation. 
He takes off his glasses and folds them and in silence starts back toward his place on the platform. A cameraman flashes a picture, and someone begins to applaud; it is taken up here and there, tepidly. On the platform, the leaders join in perfunctorily. We see one peasant face (Shukla) -- which we will come to know -- watching from the crowd of outsiders who stand in the doorways. 
Nehru, who has been looking at Gandhi with interest and some surprise turns to Patel. 
NEHRU Have you read his magazine? 
PATEL No -- but I think I'm going to.

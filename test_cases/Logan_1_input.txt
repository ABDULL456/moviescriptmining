X23-22: Can FREEZE OBJECTS with her cryogenic breath. 
X23-20: Can TRANSFORM AND MOVE ORGANIC PLANT LIFE -- grasses, trees, plants, a sort of green "Magneto". 
X23-11: Can generate seismic energy in nearby objects... Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                  52. 
Logan keeps flipping through the files, until he finds the one he's really looking for: LAURA. 
"High IQ" "Volatile emotional swings" "Difficult to control" "Signs of Manic Depression in source genetics." 
"SOURCE DNA: JAMES HOWLETT." 
Clinical photos of Laura's Adamantium implant. Medical images of this little girl on a stainless table, in exquisite pain. 
Logan can't look anymore. They bring back his own dark memories. Closing it, he finds a WRINKLED PHOTO clipped to the back. It's of GABRIELA AND ANOTHER NURSE (MARIA) WITH OTHER YOUNG MUTANTS IN A LAB. On back is that address in North Dakota. And a list of names: "Delilah, Rictor, Bobby, Rebecca, Laura and Charlotte." 
Logan tucks the file back in the backpack, then notices something else... wadded in a side pocket. 
SEVERAL COMIC BOOKS. X-MEN comic books. 
LOGAN ...For fuck's sake. 
EXT. TRUCK STOP - MORNING 
As Pierce and his Reavers show up and take over the place. They start sealing it off, and head in to the MINI MART... 
INT. TRUCK STOP MINI MART - MORNING 
The clerk is scared/confused as Pierce and a Reaver enter and lock the door behind them... 
CLERK Who are you guys? More cops? Dude, I already told them everything. 
INT./EXT. VAN - TRUCK STOP - MORNING 
Where a battered Caliban sits, guarded by a Reaver, the red slicker in his lap. The Reaver beside him reaches over and raises the SHADE. Caliban recoils and we now see the blisters on his face from the previous exposure to light. 
INT. OKLAHOMA CITY CASINO/HOTEL - SUITE - DAY 
Laura finishes tying her NEW SHOES amid some clothing boxes. She also wears a new unicorn shirt, new skirt and leggings. The ones from the display. She's pleased and meets eyes with-- Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                53. 
Logan, who emerges from the bathroom with the backpack. He doubletakes at her, then grabs another bottle from the mini bar. We hear canned gunfire from the next room. 
Laura crosses to Charles in the bedroom and sits on the edge of the bed where he is watching "Shane." On screen, the big "shoot out" grabs Laura's attention. 
Logan walks in, watching indifferently. 
Laura remains riveted as on-screen-- SHANE KNEELS DOWN AND SAYS GOODBYE TO LITTLE JOEY: 
SHANE (ON TV) A man has to be what he is, Joey. Can't break the mould. I tried and it didn't work. There's no living with a killing. There's no going back. Right or wrong, it's a brand. A brand that sticks. Now run on home to your mother, and you tell her... everything's alright and there aren't any more guns in the valley. 
Logan looks up as he hears a sigh from Charles. 
Logan clears his throat and they both turn his way. He holds up the THE X-MEN COMIC. 
LOGAN You read this in your spare time? 
She sees the comic in his hand, backpack in the other--gets up and grabs them both from Logan and turns back to the film. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) You do know this is bullshit, right? A quarter of it happened. And none like this. In the real world, people die and no self promoting asshole in a leotard can stop it. This is just ice cream for BED-WETTERS AND-- 
CHARLES --Logan. 
Logan turns to Charles who forces a smile. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) I think Laura well understands life's impermanence. (BEAT) (MORE) Final Shooting - 8/23/2016                                   54. 
CHARLES (CONT'D) Didn't you say something about finding us a new ride? 
Logan looks at the two of them, all chummy now, and gets up. 
LOGAN Right. Fine. 
He pauses at the door and tosses a pill vial to Charles. Laura catches it. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Take two more in an hour. 
CHARLES Good-bye, Logan. 
INT./EXT. LIMO - OUTSKIRTS OF OKLAHOMA CITY - DAY 
As Logan drives past a USED CAR dealership. He goes around the corner, starts looking around, goes another few blocks until he sees what he's looking for-- 
EXT. OKLAHOMA CITY - SIDE STREET - DAY 
Shitty block. Graffiti everywhere. A GANG OF YOUNG THUGS hang beneath the interstate overpass. 
Logan gets out of his limo, checks the back, sees a couple more of Laura's UNCANNY X-MEN COMICS lying on the bench. Grabs them. Checks that's everything. Then finds several of Charles pills wedged in the car seat. 
LOGAN ...Fuck. 
He slams the door, walking past THE THUGS, tossing them the LIMO KEYS. 
LOGAN (CONT'D) Knock yourselves out. 
Walking toward the car lot, Logan eyes the cars in the lot all with sale written on their windshields. 
Behind him, the thugs cross to the limo, glancing at Logan before getting in, and laying rubber in the other direction. Logan flips the liquor bottle in the trash.

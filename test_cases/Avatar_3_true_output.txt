Grace, towering over Wainfleet, motions him to hang back. 
GRACE Stay with the ship. (for Jake) One idiot with a gun's enough. 
WAINFLEET Whatever you say, Doc. 
Jake takes point as they enter the jungle. 
WAINFLEET (LAUGHING) Ya'll have fun out there. 
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY 
The forest engulfs JAKE, GRACE and NORM in cyan gloom. The shadows are alive with the CHITTERING sounds of unseen alien wildlife. 
TRACKING WITH JAKE as he moves through the foliage, hyper- alert -- looking around like a tourist in Hell.A monkey-like PROLEMURIS leaping from limb to limb overhead, flashing through the sunlight streaming down in shafts. 
A PLANT with swaying tendrils which reach toward Jake as he passes. 
This forest is more alive than any on Earth, with plants that react and move like animals. Jake white-knuckles his rifle as if every shadow conceals razor-fanged death. 
GRACE Relax, Marine. You're making me nervous. 
She pushes ahead of him on the trail, forcing him to lower his muzzle as he follows her. Grace moves nimbly on the path, seemingly unconcerned. CUT TO: 
EXT. FOREST/ GLEN 
WIDE SHOT as the party moves between the huge trees, tiny as ants. The trail has gotten steeper, the going tougher. CUT TO: 
EXT. SCHOOL RUINS - DAY 
They enter a clearing with an OVERGROWN BUILDING made of timbers cut from the local trees, with a thatch roof. It is covered with vines as the jungle reclaims it. 
NORM How will they know we're here? 
GRACE I'm sure they're watching us right now. 
Norm gulps. Jake looks behind him as they approach the school, feeling unseen eyes. CUT TO: 
INT. SCHOOL RUINS 
TRACKING WITH JAKE'S BOOTS as he steps among dried leaves and a few moldering CHILDREN'S BOOKS. Floorboards CREAK. 
GRACE (O.S.) The kids were so bright, so eager to learn... they picked up English faster than I could teach it to them. 
WIDER as Jake explores the room. Grace and Norm are selecting INSTRUMENTS from storage cases on a wooden table. 
GRACE Bring the soil probe -- right there, yellow case. 
Jake looks up at a RUSTLING among the dark rafters. Roosting STINGBATS eye him warily, fluttering their wings. 
Grace picks up a moldering copy of "The Lorax" by Dr. Seuss from the floor and puts it back on a shelf. 
GRACE (WISTFULLY) The stingbats knock them off. I guess I always hope somebody will come back and read them. 
NORM Why don't they come back? 
GRACE (GRIMLY) The Na'vi learned as much about us as they needed to know. 
Jake sees something, and approaches the blackboard -- reaches out to touch a pattern of holes blasted into the slate. Unmistakably BULLET HOLES. 
JAKE (turning to her) What happened here? 
GRACE (SHARPLY) Are you going to help with this gear? We've got a lot to do. 
She turns away.   Jake watches her as he jams equipment into his pack. CUT TO: 
EXT. RAINFOREST - DAY 
CLOSE ON Grace's blue hand gently brushing away soil, exposing a tangle of ROOT TENDRILS. 
GRACE See, right here where the roots of the two trees interact. 
WIDER -- GRACE and NORM crouch among enormous octopoidal roots. She takes a tiny sample using a needle-like probe. Norm uses a digital DEVICE to scan the roots. 
JAKE, bored, scouts ahead a few meters. 
He comes to a GLADE filled with shoulder-high SPIRAL PLANTS called HELICORADIANS. 
He BRUSHES one and SHTOONK! -- it SUCKS DOWN into a tube in the ground so quickly it seems to simply vanish. 
Curious, Jake touches another -- SHTOONK! And another -- like popping balloons after a party. SHTOONK! SHTOONK! SHTOONK! 
A chain reaction begins and the whole colony pulls down into the ground, REVEALING -- 
A HAMMERHEAD TITANOTHERE. Like a six-legged rhinoceros, but twice that size. Its massive, low-slung head has projections of bone giving it the look of a hammerhead shark. 
Its baleful eyes lock onto him.   Jake raises his rifle. 
Grace, alerted by the creature's SNORTS, runs to where she can see the tableau. She presses her THROAT MIKE. 
GRACE Don't shoot. You'll piss it off. 
The bull HAMMERHEAD bellows and lowers its 3 meter wide sledgehammer of a skull. 
JAKE It's already pissed off! 
GRACE Jake, that armor's too thick. Trust me. 
Jake starts to back away.   The hammerhead bellows again, pawing the earth. 
GRACE It's a territorial threat display. Do not run, or he'll charge. 
JAKE What do I do? 
GRACE Hold your ground! 
The hammerhead SLASHES its head sideways, splintering saplings. It bellows again, lowers its head and CHARGES -- 
Jake SCREAMS at the top of his lungs, spreads his arms wide and runs straight at the thing. 
It STOPS abruptly, with an oversized BLEAT. 
ON JAKE -- amazed the gambit worked. 
JAKE Oh yeah!   Who's bad?! That's right.

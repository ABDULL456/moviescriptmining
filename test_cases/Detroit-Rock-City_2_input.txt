INT. VOLVO - DAY 
Christine sits between Jam and Lex in the back SNAPPING gum. Jam and Lex stare at her like cats looking at a fish bowl. 
Hawk looks in the rearview mirror at Christine checking herself in a compact. She swathes on some 7-Up flavored, Bonnie Bell lip gloss. 
Trip meanwhile twirls the joint he's just finished rolling in his mouth, sealing it. He winks at her disgustingly. 
CHRISTINE Oh, great. I just hitched a ride with a bunch of potheads... I'm hooking up with some people at this funky place in downtown Detroit called Disco Inferno. Mind droppin' me there? 
TRIP (smirks) What's it worth to you? 
CHRISTINE (grossed out) What the hell is that supposed to mean? 
JAM It doesn't mean anything. Don't pay attention to him. 
HAWK (rolls his eyes) Disco Inferno? Disco's infernal morelike. 
Trying to be suave, Lex moves in close, putting the make on her. 
LEX Your clothes may say disco, but your eyes say rock 'n' roll, baby. 
CHRISTINE Well, your tee-shirt may say rock 'n' roll, but your breath says pepperoni, baby. 
She pushes him away. Jam laughs. 
TRIP (frustrated) So, are you, like, gonna polish our nobs, or what? 
CHRISTINE (thoroughly offended) What? That's disgusting! 
JAM Trip! That's so fuckin' rude, man. 
TRIP Oh, quit bein' the wussy, sensitive guy to impress her, Jam. She's obviously not gonna put out. She's a fuckin' tease. 
CHRISTINE Tease? What the hell did I do to tease you mongoloids? 
TRIP You got in the car, didn't you? 
CHRISTINE Oh, God, how calculating of me to lead you all on like that after you offered me a ride in the middle of nowhere. 
TRIP Whatever... stella. 
Trip lights the joint and takes a lungful of pot. He passes it to Lex and the joint begins to make its rounds with the exception of Christine. The car starts to fill with smoke. 
CHRISTINE The name's Christine, not stella. And there's no need to be such pigs just cause I prefer Donna Summer or KC and the Sunshine Boys or the Village People over KISS? 
HAWK (with disdain) The Village People? They're fags! You're a fag hag! 
JAM Come on, Hawk. 
CHRISTINE I can take care of myself, but thanks anyway, germ. 
JAM Jam. 
CHRISTINE Whatever. (to Hawk) Okay, Joe Burnout, let's get one thing straight here. As far as I'm concerned good tunes is good tunes, be it disco or rock or polka or whatever have you, regardless of the category. True, if I had to choose, I'd pick the category labelled disco because I happen to enjoy dancing. Disco is just easier to dance to. 
HAWK You call that John Travolta/Denny Terio shit dancing? I wouldn't dance like that in private if you paid me. 
TRIP Disco blows dogs for quarters. 
Christine processes this remark. 
CHRISTINE Now there's an intelligently biting remark wrought with wit and irony. 
Trip looks confused, then smiles thinking she paid him a compliment. 
HAWK Hey, if you don't like that one, maybe you'll think it's funny when we throw your ass out the goddamn car! 
CHRISTINE Yeah, why don't you put your money where your mouth is? 
HAWK Why don't you kiss my hairy crack? 
CHRISTINE Why don't you bend over, you're looking right at it! 
All, Christine included, pause to think about what that comment was supposed to mean. Lex takes a hit off the joint. 
LEX (holding in smoke) That last remark fell about 30 yards away from making any sense whatsoever. 
Hawk and Trip immediately bust into the giggles and it doesn't take long for Lex and Jam to follow suit.

{"train": "\"MUMFORD\" \nScreenplay by \nLawrence Kasdan \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nEXT. MAIN STREET, SMALL TOWN - DAY \nA freight truck of late 1950's vintage pulls to the side of the road in a small rural town. A handsome, well-built man gets out of the passenger side and thanks the Driver. THE NEWCOMER carries his coat over his shoulder and a beat-up suitcase; he's got a jut jaw and a modified pompadour, his shirtsleeves are rolled all the way up past his biceps. He wipes his brow against the sweltering heat and looks around. [Until noted below, this section of the movie is in BLACK & WHITE.] \nFOLLETT (V.O.) I get outta the truck in this two- bit town. I got no money and no prospects. What I need right now is a stiff drink, a cold shower, and a hot broad. I'll take 'em in any order they come... \nEXT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY \nOld three story gothic house in ill-repair beyond a peeling picket fence and a scruffy yard. The sign says -- ROOMS TO RENT. The Newcomer goes in the gate. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) ...Oh yeah, one other thing I need -- an angle. \nHe squints through the dirty screen door but sees nothing, then knocks and turns away to survey the neighborhood. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) I was thinking -- if it weren't for bad luck, I wouldn't have any luck at all... \nLANDLADY (O.S.) Can I help you? \nThe Newcomer turns toward the door. Standing there, holding the screen open, is the LANDLADY. She's a knockout in a cheap, small-town way: a cotton dress that buttons down the front and clings with sweat to her generous curves. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) Either my luck had just changed, or Fate just bought me another round of trouble. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE - DAY \nThe Newcomer's POV of the Landlady as she leads him up the narrow, gloomy stairs from the second floor to the third story / attic. She has a Monroe-like sway to her walk. We can barely HEAR her DISTANT, ECHOEY DIALOGUE: \nLANDLADY ...not very fancy... house needs repairs... We haven't had a man around here for so long... \nFOLLETT (V.O.) She kept yammerin' the whole time, but her hips were doing all the talking... \nThe Landlady reaches the tiny landing at the top of the stairs and opens a door to a squalid room with a bed, bureau and tiny window. The Newcomer has to squeeze by her voluptuous body to get inside and look around. It doesn't take long. His gaze returns to the Landlady who is leaning against the door, chest thrust forward. He focusses on her fingers, toying with the button at her sweat-shiny cleavage. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) It couldn't 'a been any clearer what the set-up was. The next move was up to me... \nThe Newcomer takes a step in the Landlady's direction -- \nMUMFORD (V.O.) Don't tell me! \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY \nCLOSE-UP of MUMFORD wincing. \nMUMFORD (softer) -- That's all the time we have. Sorry... (indicates his watch) ...next time. \nWe see Mumford's office: the office of a Psychologist, a therapist with a doctorate. It's modest, comfortable, neat, with a calm, relaxed ambience. [The movie is now in COLOR.] His patient, HENRY FOLLETT, looks nothing like The Newcomer in the soft-core fantasy he's been narrating. Instead, he's a mild-looking pharmacist with glasses and a receding hairline. Only the voice is the same; it's as studly as his fantasy alter-ego. Follett has been lying on a couch, but now has twisted with some irritation to look at Mumford. \nFOLLETT I have eighteen more minutes! \nMUMFORD I don't want to hear any more today. \nFOLLETT Why not? \nMUMFORD Mr. Follett, do you trust me or don't you? \nFOLLETT Well, I don't know... I only been seeing you -- \nMUMFORD Without trust, there's no point to any of this. You might as well not come. \nFOLLETT Now hold on, I didn't say I didn't want to come -- \nMUMFORD Good, then go. \nINT. LILY'S CAF\u00c9- DAY \nLunch crowd. Mumford can be seen out the big front window, crossing from the two-story building that houses his office on the main drag of this small town which, oddly enough, is also called Mumford. He comes inside and goes to the counter to pick up some take-out. The Proprietor is a woman around forty named LILY, who talks to him as she works. \nLILY You're early... it's not ready. What happened? \nMUMFORD My patient had to leave early. \nNESSA You really need to let people smoke in here, you know. It's perverse. What are they paying you to see me? \nMumford indicates \"nothing\". \nNESSA The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that? \nMUMFORD It's called pro bono. \nNESSA Pro boner? (he waits her out) Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly? \nMUMFORD It's my bit for the community. \nNESSA Fuck the community. (he won't go for it) There was this article my friends and I read. It was \"25 Signs He's Great in Bed\". It was very fascinating. \nMUMFORD Where was this? \nNESSA Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- \"he handles produce well.\" Which we already knew! (an expression she uses) The point is, you have a lot of the signs. \nMUMFORD You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa? \nNESSA Have women found you attractive? \nMumford laughs. \nNESSA I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever... (quietly) Which we already knew... \nMUMFORD That's not quite what I said -- \nNESSA It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something... \nMumford waits. \nNESSA Well, I guess I'm just a dumb bitch, but how depressing is that moment -- the moment when you give up? \nEXT. HIKING TRAIL, MOUNTAIN FOREST - MAGIC \nThe last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well. \nEXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC \nMumford climbs out on the Big Rock, settles himself on the edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle. \nWHAT HE SEES: far below at the foot of these hills, lights just twinkling on, is the town of Mumford. He stares at it for several long moments. Then he takes a small headlamp from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks like a miner's light). He twists the light on to test it and turns his head to watch the beam move about. \nWE CUT BACK WIDE. After a beat, Mumford settles back and turns off the light. \nINT. SCATTERGOOD'S TAVERN - NIGHT \nThe place is quietly busy with the regulars. Mumford has a favorite spot at the far end of the bar. Right now he's sitting alone, reading the remnants of a newspaper. \nSKIP SKIPPERTON, the man on the skateboard, comes in. Everyone in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here. Several patrons greet him as he makes his way deeper inside, looking around. He's uncomfortable. He seems relieved when he spots Mumford and heads back there. Mumford doesn't notice Skip waiting for his attention. \nSKIP Hi. \nMumford looks up, smiles. Skip offers his hand. \nSKIP You're Doc Mumford. (Mumford nods) Skip Skipperton. \nMUMFORD How are you? \nSKIP Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you. \nMumford waits, friendly. Skip runs out of gas, gets uneasy, glances around. \nSKIP Do you think we could...? Can I buy you a drink? \nCUT TO: \nLATER. IN A BOOTH near the back. They've been at it a while, but nothing is clear to Mumford, yet. Skip keeps his voice down; he doesn't want anyone else in the bar to hear him. \nSKIP ...\"Find the need and fill it\" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off. \nMUMFORD No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from? \nSKIP Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days. \nSkip stares into his beer for a moment, as though the thought depresses him. He catches himself and snaps back -- \nLIONEL Kind of impatient for a big-time headshrinker, aren't you? How 'bout you let me explain it my own way... \nAs Lionel goes on, Mumford's eyes again dart toward -- THE CLOCK: still 2:23! Hold on it. Finally, it moves. Mumford's eyes dart toward his desk -- \nA deadly-looking letter opener in the shape of Excalibur stands GLINTING LIGHT in a marble rendition of Arthur's stone. \nLIONEL ...and in the dream, it's always the same, I wake up in my room from when I was I kid in Ohio, and I realize this is the day of the big exam at school... \nMumford's head rocks slowly back for a moment as if he's going to drift off. He snaps back to life and stares hard at the top of Lionel's head, where there is a bald spot starting to take hold. The sound of LIONEL'S VOICE begins to echo -- \nLIONEL ...which is no problem for me, because I remembered it was coming and I've attended every class, so I'm totally prepared. Then I see myself running down the hall at school... \nMUMFORD'S GLANCE FLASHPANS from Lionel's bald spot to the gleaming letter opener. \nMumford closes his eyes. We CUT TO: \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY \nA boy, unmistakably the Young Lionel, runs down the deserted hallway toward a bright doorway. [LIONEL'S DREAM has a BLUE TINT.] \nLIONEL (V.O.) ...but it's not really my school -- and this is very interesting -- it's the school from the next district -- \nMUMFORD (V.O.) -- Go on! \nINT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY \nYoung Lionel comes breathlessly in the classroom door and stares alarmed. \nLIONEL (V.O.) And even though I arrive a little bit early, everybody's already there. But the surprising part is -- \nWHAT YOUNG LIONEL SEES: Everyone in the class, including the Teacher in the front, is naked. The Teacher holds out an exam toward Young Lionel. \nLIONEL (V.O.) -- I'm the only one who's prepared! \nCUT TO: \nINT. WAITING ROOM, MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nALTHEA BROCKETT, a woman in her forties, sits on the couch reading a mail order catalogue for home furnishings. There are several other catalogues sticking out of her jammed, woven carry-all. \nThe door to Mumford's inner office opens with some force. Mumford stands looking back across his office at Lionel, who is getting up from the couch in some confusion. \nLIONEL -- you crazy? You can't do this! \nMUMFORD Sure I can, Lionel. \nLIONEL I'm a criminal lawyer -- you think I like my clients? I can't stand most of them! But I don't kick them out... \nMUMFORD See that sign -- We retain the right to refuse service to anyone. I'm not going to charge you for this session, but I don't want to see you back here. \nLionel looks around, but there is no such sign. He does spot Althea watching the show from the couch. \nLIONEL Don't you at least have a back door I can use? \nMUMFORD Come out this way. There's no shame in getting a little therapy... is there, Althea? \nAlthea stands up, smiling. She thinks Mumford is the bee's knees. \nALTHEA Not at all. It takes guts, Lionel. \nLionel steams by them in a black mood. \nLIONEL Maybe some of us don't need this crap! \nMUMFORD And it's the Hubble Telescope, not the Himball Telescope. \nLionel bangs out the front door. Mumford motions Althea inside -- \nMUMFORD Jeez... what an asshole. \nAlthea heads inside, giggling wildly. She can't get enough of this guy. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE -DAY \nAlthea is sobbing. Mumford hands her a new Kleenex from the box next to the couch. She wads it with her current one and tries to stop crying. Mumford settles back in his chair, patient. \nALTHEA What do they want from me? (more sobbing) What have I done that's so wrong? (pulling it together) They act as though they don't have their own peculiar things... They do! Believe me. Everybody's got something... (looks at Mumford) Even you probably have things. \nMUMFORD No... a little. There's a lot of debate about it. \nCOOK Yeah, I got that. Some people think it's all in their heads. (more intense) It's been so bad she's had to move back here to Mumford and live with us. And I'm not sure that's the best thing, either... \nMUMFORD Why's that? \nCOOK Oh... a lot of things. Several different factors. Will you see her, Doctor Mumford? \nMUMFORD Sure. Why don't you bring her up to my office at 3 tomorrow afternoon. \nCook nods, but looks worried. \nCOOK I'm not sure she'll come. She's in a mood. Do you ever go to somebody's house? \nMUMFORD Generally that doesn't work out so well. It sends the wrong message to people who need to make a change. \nCook is quick to agree; he doesn't want to make waves. But he's worried. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nMumford is walking up the busy sidewalk carrying his new 5- foot stepladder hooked on his shoulder. Folks greet him. Suddenly Lionel appears in front of Mumford, who stops. \nMUMFORD Hello, Lionel. \nLIONEL You've got to have the right ladder for the job. You don't know what you're doing, you can get yourself in trouble. \nMUMFORD You're right, as usual. See you. \nMumford continues up the street. We STAY WITH Lionel, who watches Mumford with a sour look, then turns to enter a small medical building. \nINT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY \nDR. ERNEST DELBANCO, a middle-aged psychiatrist with longish, vanity hair, and PHYLLIS SHEELER, a psychologist in her thirties, sit on the doctor's comfortable furniture, listening. The remains of their take-out lunch is on the coffee table. They seem a little impatient with their as-yet- unseen visitor -- \nLIONEL (O.S.) ...completely inappropriate and highly unprofessional. Now I don't want to presume to tell you how to run your businesses -- \nSHEELER -- practices. \nLionel is sitting across the room, making an ardent case -- \nLIONEL -- Whatever. Six months ago, you two were the only games in town. The value of your... (mocking) ...\"practices\" could be seriously undermined by this bozo. A town this size has only so many headcases to go around. \nDELBANCO What exactly would you have us do, Lionel? \nLIONEL Protect your turf! Check this guy out. I smell a rat, I tell you. \nDelbanco and Sheeler exchange a look; they find Lionel distasteful. \nSHEELER Mr. Dillard, I'm sure Dr. Delbanco shares my gratitude for your concern. But I also know he'd agree that you misunderstand the nature of our calling to mental health. We're not in some... widget business, trying to crush our competition. \nLIONEL What the hell's a widget? \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY \nLionel comes out of the office, miffed, and goes down the stairs. A moment later, the door opens slightly and Delbanco peeks out to make sure Lionel is gone. He closes the door on us. \nINT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY \nDelbanco stands at the door looking across the room at Sheeler. \nDELBANCO What an asshole! \nSHEELER (agrees) Ernest, what do you think? \nDELBANCO I think he's got a point. \nSo does she. \nEXT. BASEBALL DIAMOND - DAY \nIdyllic. The beautifully manicured field is surrounded by lush woods. Standing about forty feet apart, Mumford and Skip are alone on the field throwing a baseball back and forth. For quite a while the only sounds are the birds, the wind, and the regular SLAP of ball into glove. Finally -- \nSKIP This is great! \nSLAP... SLAP. \nSKIP This is exactly what I wanted. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nSilence. Nessa sits staring at Mumford defiantly, an unlit cigarette in her mouth. Mumford looks at the clock -- 3:00 -- and stands up, session over. Nessa quickly lights her cigarette with the lighter concealed in her hand and stands up too. She exhales a huge cloud of smoke and walks quickly to the back door of the office, which Mumford has opened for her, and goes out. \nMumford waves half-heartedly at the cloud of smoke as he walks to the door to the waiting room and opens it. \nMUMFORD'S POV: As the door swings open, the first figure we see is Mr. Cook; he twists around at the sound of the door. He acknowledges Mumford and then sighs as he steps aside to reveal, sitting exhausted in a chair, his daughter -- \nSOFIE -- a young woman whose actual appearance is somewhat disguised at present by her wan, ashen visage. She regards Mumford with some resignation. Her father helps her out of the chair. Sofie keeps her eyes on Mumford. \nCLOSE ON Mumford, watching her. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nLATER. Mr. Cook is gone. Sofie is sitting up on the couch, facing Mumford. She looks like she might pass out at any moment, but her voice is stronger than you'd expect. \nMUMFORD Feel free to lie down. Most people do. \nSOFIE I'd better not, I'll fall right to sleep. I think it's too soon for me to be sleeping with you. \nA joke. Mumford smiles. \nMUMFORD What can you tell me about this? \nSOFIE Oh, lord. It's almost too exhausting to tell you... (tiny smile, to herself) ...about my exhaustion. I didn't really want to come. I'm not hopeful right now. But I couldn't take the look on my dad's face. He's a truly kind person, which is pretty extraordinary if you knew the story. He's the opposite of me, I guess -- all stamina and resolve. \nIt's taken all her energy to say this and she sinks down a bit into the couch. \nMUMFORD When did you start to feel this way? \nSOFIE About six months ago, I guess it is now. God, it seems like years. What a bore! I'm embarrassed by it. Before this happened -- when I'd hear people talk about this kind of thing -- I thought it was a bunch of bullshit. \nShe sees something in his face and suddenly laughs -- it's a weak but magical sound. \nMUMFORD What? \nSOFIE You think that now! You think it's a bunch of hooey, don't you? \nMUMFORD (unconvincing) No. \nSOFIE I saw it. I saw it in your eyes. \nMumford is knocked off balance -- she's right. She saw him clearly. \nSOFIE That's okay. Maybe it is. My mother always says -- \"Everything that's wrong with you is in your head.\" I suppose that's true. \nMUMFORD Back when this started, was there anything unusual happening in your life? A change of job, of living situation... a loss of some kind? \nSOFIE No... but it started one year to the day after my divorce became final. That's not too suspicious, is it?... But it wasn't like I was feeling bad about the divorce. Just the opposite. \nMUMFORD Hmm. \nSOFIE Hmm? Is that a professional opinion? \nMUMFORD Hmm, as in -- that's interesting. Sometimes, with enough clues, it's possible to figure these things out. \nSOFIE Even if you don't think it's real? \nMUMFORD I don't know what's real and what isn't. That's never been my strong suit. But if you're tired all the time and you've had to give up the life you were having and come back home when you didn't want to... that's worth trying to fix. Maybe I can help you do that. \nSOFIE What would you do? \nMUMFORD We... we would try several things. But I need to see you a lot. \nSOFIE I don't know. I barely made it today. \nMUMFORD I'll come to you. We'll try a little walking. \nSofie suddenly looks defeated. \nMUMFORD We'll take it slow. You'll never feel you can't handle it. \nSOFIE I don't think I can afford it. I don't want my dad paying. \nMUMFORD We'll work it out. \nSofie gives him a long look. \nMumford is hunched over the computer, reading avidly. His printer is churning out hard copies. \nEXT. FRONT PORCH, COOK HOUSE - DAY \nMumford comes out the front door and holds it open for Sofie. He offers his arm and she takes it tentatively. \nSOFIE I'm not making any promises. \nMUMFORD We'll turn back anytime you want. \nSOFIE (seeing something) Oh boy... this should be interesting. \nMumford looks out toward the street. A woman in her fifties is turning into the front walk. She stares at them, unsmiling, as the two parties converge. She is MRS. COOK. \nSOFIE Hello, Mother. I want you to meet Dr. Mumford. \nMRS. COOK Mumford... like the town? \nMUMFORD (offering his hand) Yes. It's nice to meet you, Mrs. Cook. \nShe finally takes his hand, but it's not friendly. \nMRS. COOK What's happening here? \nSOFIE We're going for a walk. \nMRS. COOK Do you think that's a good idea? \nSOFIE Dr. Mumford does, yes. I've put myself completely in his hands. For today, anyway. \nMRS. COOK What kind of doctor are you? \nMUMFORD Ph.D., psychologist. \nMRS. COOK Oh... not a real doctor. \nMUMFORD That's right, the fake kind. \nMrs. Cook is not amused. Sofie pulls on Mumford. \nSOFIE We'd better go or I'm liable to bail on the whole thing. \nMrs. Cook steps aside as they move up the walk. \nEXT. SIDEWALK, NEAR THE COOK HOUSE - DAY \nMumford and Sofie, foreground, walk slowly up the block. In the background, Mrs. Cook watches for awhile before going inside. \nSOFIE Mom's such a cutie. \nMUMFORD People usually have to get to know me before they hate me. \nSOFIE She's not in a bad mood. She's like that all the time. (a beat) It doesn't bother me anymore. It's my dad and my brother I worry about. \nMUMFORD Maybe... but you're the one whose ass is dragging. \nSOFIE (laughs) Is that the technical description of what I've got? \nMUMFORD Is she against you getting help? \nSOFIE We don't discuss it. \nMUMFORD Something's bothering her. \nSOFIE Oh, we've all disappointed her. Me, especially, but Dad, of course. She thinks my brother's all right, but she didn't expect much. It's what happens when you \"marry beneath yourself\"... \nSofie suddenly seems to be fading. \nMUMFORD Please... forgive me. \nSOFIE What? \nMUMFORD Negative thinking makes everything more difficult. If you're going to have enough strength to do this, we have to talk only about positive things. All right? \nShe looks at him, unsure if he's serious. It seems so corny. But she agrees. \nMUMFORD Okay then... Are you positive your mother's a bitch? (she laughs, surprised) Just kidding. \nSkip closes his eyes for a second and gathers himself. \nSKIP All right, I'm just gonna tell you, as simple and direct as I can. (one last spasm of doubt) And you understand that this is a big secret? Just between us? (Mumford does) Okay. You know I've got this gift for certain kinds of... machines. \nMUMFORD You are Panda, monarch of modems. \nSKIP That's right. And you also know that even though I make 23% of the modems in the world... I cannot make one simple connection with any woman who could truly love me. \nMUMFORD Okay... let's say that, for now. \nSKIP It's true, believe me. So... do you know what I've been doing, all alone, in my workshop, for almost two years?... Mr. Find-the-Need-and-Fill- It. How I spend my every solitary hour? \nMumford shakes his head, \"no.\" \nSKIP Guess. (Mumford demurs) Go ahead, guess! \nMUMFORD (if he must) Jerking off? \nSKIP No!... Although that's a good guess. No, what I've been working on, what the world really needs and no one has been able to create -- (leans in, whispering) -- a virtually life-like, humanoid, gender-specific, anatomically functional... sexual surrogate slash companion. \nMumford tries to put that all together. Finally -- \nMUMFORD Slash what? \nSKIP Sexual surrogate... slash... companion. \nMUMFORD A doll? \nSKIP No, Doc, not a doll. I am Panda. I'm talking about much, much more than a doll. The world has never seen what I'm talking about... except maybe in the movies. \nMumford considers that a long time, watching as the sun finally sinks below the horizon. He looks back at Skip. \nMUMFORD How's it coming? \nSKIP You don't think I'm insane? \nMUMFORD (\"no\") And that's your secret? (Skip: \"yes\") You meant -- like a trade secret? \nSKIP No, Doc, a private secret! It's perverted, it's pitiful. What am I -- Dr. Frankenstein? Aren't you repulsed? \nMUMFORD Sounds like kind of a good idea. \nSKIP (nonplussed) Really? \nMUMFORD Definitely. \nIt's getting dark fast now. Mumford reaches into his bag and takes out the headlamp we saw earlier. He fits the straps carefully over his head. \nMUMFORD Skip, that's not much of a secret. \nSKIP (hurt) It's not? \nMUMFORD Oh, it's okay. It's just not something to be ashamed of. Maybe you don't want people knowing -- and believe me, it's safe with me -- but on the scale of dirty little secrets, I'd give it, say... a two. \nMumford twists the headlamp and the light shines out in the dusk. Mumford turns the beam directly at Skip. \nMUMFORD You want to know a secret? I'll tell you a secret. Since it's just between us and all... \nSkip, hanging on every word now, agrees emphatically. \nMUMFORD The secret, Skip, is this -- I am not now, nor have I ever been... a psychologist. \nAt first, Skip thinks he's misunderstood Mumford. But in the huge silence that ensues, he replays it and knows he's heard right. Mumford looks around, adjusts his headlamp, and gets up. \nMUMFORD We'd better get going. Just follow my light. And, Skip, watch your step. \nEXT. MUMFORD'S PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT \nThis porch is directly above Lily's porch. Mumford and Skip sit nursing beers. There's a cooler on the floor. Mumford's legs are propped up on the porch railing \nSKIP Who else knows? \nMUMFORD Just you. \nSKIP It's time you did some talkin', Dr. Mum -- Wait a minute. That is your name, isn't it? \nMumford takes a drink of beer. \nA PROFESSOR approaches camera and lays a fresh examination on the desk in front of Mumford. The problem is -- Mumford is so doped up the classroom is swimming and the examination paper keeps changing shape. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) All that fun eventually had an impact on the work I was doing. I figured, what the hell, it was only college, after all. I'd straighten up when I went out in the real world... \nINT. OFFICE BUILDING CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nTIGHT ON SEVERAL AMPHETAMINE CAPSULES being dumped into Mumford's palm over a water fountain. They disappear toward camera as we dip down toward the stream of water. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) I didn't want to jump into my career right out of college. And since I had no career, that turned out to be not much of a problem... \nMUMFORD'S POV lifts from the fountain and turns to the endless, deserted corridor of the huge building. We begin TRACKING DOWN the hall, checking out the various doorways. A Cleaning Crew appears far up ahead. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) I had a series of challenging jobs over the next few years... \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nWe PAN from the back of a garbage truck to a mess of garbage containers, and MOVE TOWARD THEM. \nINT. GAS STATION - NIGHT \nTIGHT ON TWO LINES of cocaine. We DIP TOWARD THEM, then UP AGAIN and they're gone. PAN to REVEAL we're in a closet off the brightly-lit office of an all-night gas station. A PATRON is waiting impatiently out by the pumps. \nEXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT \nBACK TO PRESENT. Skip watches Mumford intently. \nMUMFORD ...pizza delivery, pipe fitting, pest control... lots of jobs that started with the letter \"p\". For some reason, I kept losing these jobs. (takes a swig of beer) The only mind-altering substance I never had a problem with was alcohol. I never got drunk. I didn't like the feeling. But really, when you're as fucked up as I was... big deal. \nMumford stands up and stretches, then sits on the railing facing Skip. \nMUMFORD Eventually, doing all these different jobs, I noticed something. For some reason, probably because I was too stoned to talk, everywhere I went -- \nINT./EXT. SERIES OF SHOTS-- TALKING HEADS \nWe see various CO-WORKERS from Mumford's jobs. The environments are radically different, but the activity is always the same -- the Co-Worker in question is pouring his heart out to camera. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) -- people would talk to me, tell me everything... their stories, their problems, their innermost thoughts. Sometimes they'd pretend they needed advice, but mostly people just wanted someone to listen. \nINT. CRAWLSPACE UNDER HOUSE - DAY \nMUMFORD'S MOVING POV as he crawls into the darkness, an insecticide sprayer ahead of him. He pushes at a cinderblock -- \nMUMFORD (V.O.) Anyway, one day I was spraying for termites when I had a vision -- \nThe cinderblock tips over and a swarm of scary-looking spiders comes rushing out toward camera. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) -- it was time to put my college degree to work and get a job with a desk. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. GOVERNMENT OFFICES - DAY \nFROM BEHIND A DESK in the middle of a huge sea of desks. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) I took the civil service exam and found myself working at the Internal Revenue Service, District 14, Central Administrative Office. I started off as a general records clerk... \nSERIES OF SHOTS: computer records scrolling rapidly, paper files being pulled, documents being routed. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) I guess the standards weren't too high there, because my superiors got excited and pushed me to take the advancement tests... \nINT. YMCA GYM - NIGHT \nAn intense basketball game. The ball zips from behind camera (Mumford) to an older guy, MUMFORD'S SUPERVISOR, under the basket; he lays it in easily, then comes over to high-five. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) One guy in particular thought I should be a Revenue Officer. There was more money to be made as your classification went up. Which had a lot of appeal to me... \nINT. KITCHEN TABLE, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT (PAST) - NIGHT \nA COCAINE MILL is loaded with white chunks and screwed shut in MUMFORD'S POV; the steady grinding begins. Spread across the messy kitchen table is the regular user's paraphernalia. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) ...since, even though I was certain I could stop anytime I wanted, I had developed a real affection for cocaine. It was my favorite hobby I had ever had. \nINT. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE OFFICES - DAY \nMUMFORD'S POV SHIFTS around the office. First, he's looking at an irate TAXPAYER yelling across a desk at a REVENUE OFFICER, who remains unruffled -- \nMUMFORD (V.O.) But I sure didn't want to be a Revenue Officer, where you were face to face abusing -- and getting abused -- all day long... \nMUMFORD (V.O.) The way the District Managers got ahead and won their bonuses was by generating maximum payments. That meant the revenue officers had to use all their \"collection tools\" -- seizures, liens, levies -- even if a more reasonable compromise could have been worked out. The best way to reduce resistance from the taxpayers was to build a convincing case -- whether there'd actually been a violation or not... \nMumford follows Gregory, crawling, to the edge of the roof and looks down on a building one block over. It is a small furniture factory. Employees are eating their lunches on the loading dock. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) That's where we came in. Our DM was a particular sonuvabitch, and he knew just how to get Gregory crazy. \nINT. ETHNIC RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nMUMFORD'S POV takes in his ATTRACTIVE DATE next to him, then PANS TO Candy and Gregory across the table. Everybody's laughing. Candy flashes Mumford a momentary special look. MUMFORD'S POV guiltily PANS TO Gregory. Did he see it? \nMUMFORD (V.O.) So several things were working on Gregory when we started building a case against a furniture maker named Edmond Worrell... \nEXT. PARKING LOT, FURNITURE FACTORY - MAGIC \nBINOCULAR VIEW of EDMOND WORRELL and MRS. WORRELL as they get in a Cadillac at the end of a workday. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) ...and his family. \nINT. BUSINESS OFFICE, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - NIGHT \nLit by powerful flashlights, Gregory and Mumford attack the files of the company, both in cabinets and on computer. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) Gregory was acting more and more irrational. We started doing things that were over the line even for the IRS. When I look back on it now, I'm sure Gregory must have known about Candy and me. On our team, I had become... \nINT. MEN'S ROOM, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - NIGHT \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP A LINE OF COCAINE on the top of a toilet tank as it is sucked out of sight. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) ...the responsible one. \nINT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - DAY \nMUMFORD'S POV IS A BLURRY SHAPE until Candy moves up and away, her face sweaty and aroused, torso naked. She's on top of Mumford. \nINT. GOVERNMENT CAR - DAY \nMumford's POV slides into the passenger seat. Gregory is already sitting in the driver's seat. He stares at Mumford a long time. \nINT. CORRIDOR, SHABBY OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nMumford is following Gregory and REVENUE OFFICER MCLURE down the hall. They reach a door with the painted sign: \"SAMUEL GORBECK, C.P.A.\" \nMUMFORD (V.O.) Sometimes when a case didn't work out right, Gregory and this Revenue Officer named McLure would put the squeeze on the subject's accountant... \nAs they start to enter, SOFT CUT TO: \nINT. GORBECK'S INNER OFFICE - DAY \nGORBECK listens, intimidated by McLure, who sits on the accountant's desk, and Gregory, who is moving around the office -- snooping. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) There aren't many accountants who don't have something to worry about with the Service... \nINT. IRS OFFICES - DAY \nEdmond Worrell, his wife, his adult SON and DAUGHTER, WORRELL'S LAWYER, and, finally, the accountant Gorbeck are ushered toward a conference room by McLure, Gregory and some other IRS types. Gorbeck sneaks a nervous look at Mumford. Gregory, who now appears slightly mad, motions for Mumford to join them. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) The parties met repeatedly over a period of months. The IRS offered to settle for a sizable but, they said, fair amount. Worrell said he'd done nothing wrong and threatened to fight it all the way to Washington. He seemed pretty strong. I was secretly pulling for him. McLure and the District Manager stepped up the pressure. \nEXT. PARKING LOT, WORRELL FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY \nMOVING POV OUT THE WINDSHIELD of Gregory's government car as it comes speeding into the parking lot. There are two flashing Squad Cars and an Ambulance at the entrance. As Gregory's car hits a speedbump, the IMAGE BEGINS TO SLOW DOWN -- \nMUMFORD (V.O.) What none of us down at the Service knew was that Edmond Worrell had a story too... Worrell's was that he'd been fighting chronic depression for thirty years. Under the heat of the investigation, he fell off his medication. One Tuesday morning, he went down to the factory early, wrote his family a letter, then used the 9mm automatic they kept there to kill himself... The DM dropped the case that day and started proceedings to get rid of Gregory... \nThe IMAGE HAS SLOWED TO A STILL. It now DISSOLVES TO: \nEXT. GREGORY'S HOUSE, CITY STREET - NIGHT \nMumford's POV as he comes up the steps. The front door opens before he gets there. Candy, her face bruised, her eyes red, comes into view, she has a suitcase in hand. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) Gregory went home drunk, beat up Candy and went out to drink some more. Candy told me she didn't want to see me again. She hated us both and she was leaving us both... It made perfect sense to me. I felt the same way... \nINT. BEDROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nMumford is frantically, futilely looking for an imagined drug stash. He's ransacked the place and is now throwing the clothes out of a drawer. \nINT. BATHROOM, MUMFORD'S CITY APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNESSA (after a beat) No. I don't know what he wants. But I know I don't like being watched. Nobody's ever paid any attention to what I did, and I liked it just fine. Where does he get off telling me I disrespect myself? (a beat) Fuck him. Look in a mirror, bozo. \nEXT. LILY'S CAF\u00c9, MAIN STREET - DAY \nMumford crosses the street from his office. A huge bus with \"APPLEJACK TOURS\" on the sides, is disgorging its passengers, a large group of elderly JAPANESE WOMEN, all of whom file neatly into Lily's Caf\u00e9. Lily stands on the sidewalk outside greeting them merrily. \nMUMFORD What's the deal? \nLily continues her welcomes, but points out a hand-lettered sign in her front window -- \"Closed for Lunch. See you tomorrow.\" \nLILY They come through a few times each year. (greeting one cheerily) Hello, Mrs. Saito, good to see you again! (back to Mumford) It's a tour. \nMUMFORD Where am I supposed to eat? \nLILY You're on your own today, honey. \nMumford's attention is suddenly drawn to something across the street. He glances thoughtfully at Lily for a moment, then back out there. \nWHAT HE SEES: Skip is once again zipping down the street on his skateboard in the midst of traffic. He has not noticed Mumford. \nMUMFORD (O.S.) Hey, Skip! \nSkip looks over, then immediately changes course toward them, barely checking the surrounding traffic. He is extraordinarily skillful. When he gets to the curb, he pulls a snazzy board- flipping maneuver to dismount and come up on the sidewalk. Some of the Japanese matrons react with delight. \nSKIP Doc. \nSkip notices the tour members filing by, but is immediately distracted by the presence of Lily, who's a little excited to meet the local celebrity. \nMUMFORD Lily, I want you to meet Skip. Skip, Lily. \nLILY It's a pleasure to meet you. \nSKIP (flustered) Yeah... me you, too... I was at your house... \nLILY Oh? \nSKIP Upstairs, with Doc... Yeah, it's very nice... I heard your shower. \nSkip can't believe what he just said. Neither can the other two, actually. Mumford can't stop himself from laughing, but he cuts it off fast. Lily blushes, but Skip's agitation has charmed her. Something's happening here. \nLILY I've seen you going by on your board, but I didn't realize -- you're so young... to be so... \nSKIP What? \nMUMFORD ...so rich? \nLILY (gives him a look) ...so accomplished. \nSKIP I may be young, but Doc can tell you, I'm very immature. \nHe's making a joke and it represents quite a recovery. They're all relieved. Then there's an awkward silence. Skip watches the last of the tour enter the restaurant. \nSKIP So, is this like a Japanese restaurant? \nLILY I'd better get in there. \nSKIP That's a lot of people all at once. \nLILY It's okay. They pre-order. There's a choice of three entrees. \nSKIP What are they? \nLily gives him a careful look: Is he really interested? There's something about him... \nLILY Meat loaf, turkey quesadillas, or salad nicoise. \nSKIP Salad nicoise? I love salad nicoise. \nLILY (giggling) You do? \nSKIP Yeah. \nLILY Well, come on in. \nShe motions him in and starts to follow. Mumford makes a \"what about me?\" sound. Lily, grinning, just points to the sign and leaves Mumford standing on the sidewalk. \nDELBANCO (O.S.) Dr. Mumford. \nSHEELER Yes... your particular approach. \nMUMFORD I don't have one really. Most of the time I'm faking it. See, I think there's not much that can be done about most problems... they're too complicated, too deep-rooted by the time I hear about them. The most I can do, usually, is look and listen real closely, try to catch some glimpse of the secret life everybody's got. If I can get a sense of that, well then, maybe... just maybe, I can help them out a little. \nMumford sits back, considering the couple across the table. His gaze is so crystalline that, after a moment, they become uncomfortable and steal a glance at each other. Finally -- \nDELBANCO I see. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nCLOSE ON Althea Brockett. \nALTHEA -- The argument had nothing to do with it. \nMUMFORD (O.S.) I understand. I just want to know what the argument was about. \nALTHEA (hates to say) I had ordered some books. \"The 100 Greatest Books Ever Written.\" \nMUMFORD (O.S.) Uh-huh. What are they? \nALTHEA Oh, all the great writers -- Shakespeare, Charles Dickens, Moby Dick... those people. Each is bound in genuine premium leather with 22 carat gold accents. It's a magnificent set -- and only $33.50 per volume. Right away you get Great Expectations for just $6.99. \nMUMFORD (O.S.) One hundred books? \nALTHEA It's irrelevant. It had nothing to do with what happened. \nMUMFORD (O.S.) What happened? \nAlthea is sitting on the couch facing Mumford. She has a bulky knit cardigan sweater hugged tightly around her -- the only sign that she's not completely calm. \nALTHEA We argued on Sunday. He went to work on Monday and stayed in the city during the week, like always. But on Thursday, when he normally comes home, he didn't. Didn't call either. Not till Saturday afternoon. \nMUMFORD You must have been concerned. \nALTHEA It's happened before. (a beat) I'm shocked by how little I'm feeling. I can't understand it. (a real question --) I'll probably have a complete depressoid collapse soon, won't I? \nMUMFORD Doubtful. What did he say? \nALTHEA He said he wasn't coming back. He said it wasn't working for him any more. That it hadn't \"worked for him\" for quite a while... You know what I regret the most? I'm sorry I let him make the kids take his name. He was an acquirer. (off Mumford's look) He liked to acquire things. \nMumford looks away. Althea realizes what he's thinking. \nALTHEA You think that has something to do with my problem? Ordering all those things?... \nIt hadn't occurred to Mumford, but it's an interesting thought. \nALTHEA ...Like I was on some kind of campaign to out-acquire him... (excited now, playing it out) ...If I was just an acquisition to him, and he lost interest once he had me -- \nShe stops, shakes her head. \nALTHEA That can't be it. It's too simple. And besides, I still like it. This morning I ordered a marble turtle cheese board from The Horchow Collection. (an odd look) Can I tell you something just awful? You know how people who are just assholes will sometimes look at a woman who's got problems and say, \"What she needs is a good shtupping!\"? \nMumford nods. \nALTHEA Well, there may be something to that. Jeremy didn't keep up his end -- Oh, what difference does it make? (suddenly) Why do I feel elated? Am I in denial? You know what it feels like?... \nShe glances at her watch, then starts talking fast -- \nALTHEA I know my time's up, but I've got to get this out while I've got hold of it -- \nMUMFORD Take your time. \nALTHEA (no slowing down) -- When I was in high school, the thing I wanted most, when I was stuck in class, the thing I was always desperately in pursuit of -- was a hall pass. That's all I wanted. I loved moving freely around the school while everybody else was trapped in there... And that's how I feel right now... Like I have some giant, all- day hall pass. \nShe is beaming, but suddenly becomes self-conscious. She stands up abruptly, flushed. \nALTHEA My god, did it just get hot in here or what? \nShe takes off the bulky sweater and bends to pick up her purse. She is wearing a simple cotton dress that buttons up the front and hugs her body. WE SEE for the first time what all her other outfits have hidden: Althea has a terrific, voluptuous figure. \nALTHEA See you next time. I'll probably be a basket case by then. \nShe heads toward the door to the waiting room. Mumford indicates the back door. \nMUMFORD You can go out there if you like... \nALTHEA (quoting Mumford) \"There's no shame in getting a little therapy\", right, Doc? \nMUMFORD Really? \nSKIP It's all your fault. In the last 48 hours, I've completely lost interest. \nMUMFORD What'd I do? \nSkip looks at Mumford, a wide grin on his face. \nSKIP Lily. \nMUMFORD Lily... (gets it) ...Skip, that's great! You and Lily. \nSKIP Oh, she doesn't know about it yet. Right now, of the two of us, I'm the only one in love. But I'm very stoked. \nSkip settles in front of the Body Parts section, framed by an array of limbs and sex toys. There's an assembled pelvic section with upper legs lying in the clutter behind him. \nSKIP Doc, how I can be of help to you? \nSkip leans back against the table and accidentally hits a button. The pelvic section begins to hump, slowly and sensually, in place. It's amazingly life-like, but it makes a mechanical WHIRRING SOUND. Skip fumbles to turn it off. \nSKIP Sorry... \nMUMFORD Wow. \nSkip gets the pelvis switched off and turns back to Mumford. \nSKIP I'm here for you, Doc. \nMUMFORD Skip, you know that it's improper -- completely unethical -- for a licensed psychologist to carry on a romantic relationship with one of his patients? \nSKIP I guess that makes sense. \nMUMFORD Yes, yes it does... \nMumford sinks into silence. He begins to wander the room. \nSKIP You've fallen in love with one of your patients? \nMumford nods. Skip is desperate to say something useful. Suddenly, he has an alarming thought. \nSKIP Doc!... It's not me, is it? \nMUMFORD What? \nMumford understands and can't stop a laugh. \nMUMFORD No, Skip, it's not you. But I like you a lot. \nSkip is relieved. He has another thought and brightens. \nSKIP Doc, what about this? You're not really a licensed psychologist! \nMumford turns to meet Skip's gaze. Skip realizes the ramifications of what he's just said. \nSKIP Hmm. I guess that doesn't help... I see where you're going here. It's a mess. \nMUMFORD Yep. \nINT. DR. DELBANCO'S OFFICE - DAY \nLionel is here with Delbanco and Sheeler. This time, Delbanco is behind his desk, Sheeler across the room on the sofa. \nLIONEL Don't you find it incredibly convenient that everyone who could possibly corroborate his story has recently died some exotic death? \nDELBANCO They're neither all recent nor exotic. \nSHEELER But they're certainly dead. And yes, personally, I find it a bit odd. \nDELBANCO It could happen. What about his state certification exams? The records seem to be in order. \nLionel's derisive snort is so obnoxious, it's hard to bear. \nLIONEL What's easier than hacking your way into a state computer and inserting some numbers? For all you know he never even took the exams! \nSHEELER That's true. \nDELBANCO I don't know that it's all that easy... \nMRS. COOK Keep it zipped, Ben. \nBen gives Mumford an exasperated look, but doesn't argue. \nMR. COOK Is there something we need to know, Dr. Mumford? \nMumford is conflicted, not sure what to share with them. \nMUMFORD Well... yes, I guess I should tell you. I don't think I'm going to be able to treat Sofie anymore. \nMr. Cook and Ben exchange an alarmed glance. Mrs. Cook actually cheers up. \nMRS. COOK Finally, some common sense... \nMUMFORD What do you mean? \nMRS. COOK I think you know what I mean. \nMUMFORD No, I really don't. \nMRS. COOK I think you do. \nMUMFORD Why don't you tell me? \nMRS. COOK (very calm) Why don't you go to hell? It's all a bunch of nonsense and you know it. \nMR. COOK Elizabeth, I'm tellin' you, stop this... \nMRS. COOK (dismissive) You're telling me? That's rich... \nMUMFORD (standing up) I'd better go. \nBEN Why can't you see Sofie? I know the treatment's working. \nMumford looks from Ben to Mr. Cook, who nods his agreement. \nMUMFORD Well... you see, the problem is -- \nMRS. COOK -- the problem is you're a big fake. You haven't got a clue what's wrong with that girl. \nMumford looks at Mrs. Cook and can't stifle a laugh. \nMUMFORD Wow. You're something. \nMRS. COOK Take a hike, Dr. Quack! \nMR. COOK (ignoring her now) What is the problem, Doctor? \nMumford can't take his eyes off Mrs. Cook, even as he speaks to Mr. Cook. \nMUMFORD Problem? I guess there is no problem... Uh, this friend of Sofie's, where'd he take her? \nBEN It's she -- Roxy. Used to work with her. I think they went over to The Lantern. \nMUMFORD (delighted) Oh, Roxy! Excellent. Roxy. \nMrs. Cook looks at him sharply. She's heard what the other two have not. \nEXT. SIDE STREET/ALLEY - DAY \nMumford carries a large Fed-Ex box down a side street and into an alley. As he passes a secluded space created by two adjacent buildings, something catches his eye. \nMUMFORD'S MOVING POV: A young couple is embracing and talking intimately. As they separate, we can see that it is Nessa and Martin Brockett. Martin sees Mumford, but makes no sign. Nessa twists to see what Martin's looking at just as the view is interrupted by a wall. \nMumford walks on, mulling what he's seen. \nEXT. BACK DOOR, FOLLETT'S PHARMACY - DAY \nThere is a locked security screen at the alley entrance to the back room of the pharmacy, but the door inside is open. When a YOUNG PHARMACIST appears in there, Mumford raps on the metal screen. \nINT. HENRY FOLLETT'S OFFICE - DAY \nFollett's private space is above and at the back of his drugstore. When you sit at his desk and in front of it, as Follett and Mumford are doing now, you can see down into the store through a floor-to-ceiling, one-way mirror. \nThe Fed-Ex box sits on the desk between the two men, unopened. \nFOLLETT What is it? \nEXT. HIKING TRAIL - DAY \nMumford and Sofie make their way slowly up the trail. Despite her labored breathing, it's clear Sofie has made enormous progress since we first saw her. \nSOFIE When I was in high school we used to come up here and make out. I liked to sit on the rock and watch the sun go down. \nMUMFORD That's what I like. \nSOFIE Which thing? \nMUMFORD Either one. \nSOFIE Why'd you come to the house the other night? \nMUMFORD I thought I had something to tell you. But it turned out I didn't. \nSOFIE My brother said you were about to fire me. \nMUMFORD That's one way to put it. \nSOFIE I bet I know what changed your mind... (Mumford looks at her) ...My mother. She was so horrible, you decided you couldn't desert me. \nMUMFORD I thought only action movies had villains like that. \nSofie gestures ahead. \nSOFIE That's the cut-off, isn't it? (Mumford nods) I know why you were going to quit seeing me. \nMumford slows at this. Sofie heads off the trail into the woods. \nEXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - DAY \nSofie appears first, but she waits for Mumford before she steps tentatively onto the rock. Mumford takes firm hold of her and leads her to a spot where she can securely settle herself. \nSOFIE You feel like a fake, an imposter... \nMumford looks up, sharply. \nSOFIE ...as if maybe you don't know what you're doing. \nShe puts a hand on his arm. \nSOFIE Everybody feels that way sometimes... like we're not who we're supposed to be. But I have to tell you, Dr. Mumford -- \nHe winces at her formality. \nSOFIE -- you've been a tremendous help to me. \nMUMFORD Yeah? \nSOFIE I can't tell you how much I admire you. You have a wonderful way with people. And you're very insightful. I feel like you've seen me clearly... I never used to admit what a horrible person my mother was. You've made that possible for me. \nMUMFORD That's... good? \nSOFIE Yes! And my ex-husband -- he never accepted me for who I was, just like Mother. The things you've said have helped me understand what a dick he is. \nMUMFORD I don't know if -- \nSOFIE You're shockingly honest, that's what makes you great. I've never had a man treat me this way. With you, I feel really... listened to. (gives him a look) Can I tell you something? It's a little embarrassing, but I feel very unguarded with you. \nMUMFORD Of course. \nSOFIE Thanks to this therapy, I now know what I'm looking for. I need to find a man like you. (laughs) Not one who's treating me, of course. (full of resolve) And I'm going to do it, dammit! You've given me the confidence. \nMumford is in agony. \nMUMFORD Sofie... that makes me very happy. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nNessa's on the couch, playing with her usual unlit cigarette. There's an uncharacteristic lightness to her. \nNESSA ...I mean, Doc, the dude is seriously deluded. I said that to him, I said, \"If you think I'm gonna do all that shit for you, man, you are seriously deluded.\" \nMUMFORD What'd he say? \nNESSA (can't hide her pleasure) He said -- \"Which we already knew!\" \nSKIP (O.S.) Far out! \nMumford smiles. He gets up and goes inside, closing the door behind him so as not to violate their privacy. He goes to the suitcase, takes out some clothes and begins putting them back in the dresser. Right now, he's not going anywhere. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP of Ernest Delbanco. We can't tell where he is at first. As he speaks, we PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying on Mumford's couch -- a patient. \nDELBANCO ...and when you said at lunch about everybody having \"a secret life\", something just snapped inside me. I knew I could no longer continue my relationship with Dr. Sheeler. It was tearing me up inside. And I know Phyllis wasn't getting what she needed from it. What had started as a genuine respect, I think, for each other's professional abilities, and became, over time, a personal attraction had somehow... migrated into a rather torrid sexual relationship... \nAcross the room, Mumford sits, chin in hand, displaying no reaction. \nDELBANCO ...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy -- (catches himself) ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow. \nMUMFORD How do you mean? \nThis next is painful for Delbanco. \nDELBANCO Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring... \nMUMFORD What kind of doubts? \nDELBANCO About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board. \nMumford digests this. \nMUMFORD I see. \nDELBANCO And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies. (brightens) There is good news, though. \nMUMFORD What's that? \nDELBANCO Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town. \nMUMFORD Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that. \nDELBANCO As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife. \nMumford's head snaps up. He had no idea Delbanco was married. \nEXT. GAS STATION, SMALL TOWN (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - DAY \nWe (CAMERA) are being pummelled by three SMALL TOWN TOUGHS behind Old Man Sutter's gas station/diner in the Follett's fantasy town. [In BLACK & WHITE.] Beyond them, Old Man Sutter's stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the backdoor of the building. We DO NOT SEE The Newcomer yet. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) Old Man Sutter's young bride had got me in hot water all right, and now I was bein' dealt the beating of my life. If there'd just been two of those bastards it would have been a little closer... \nOne of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace. CUT TO BLACK, then FADE UP ON: \nINT. ATTIC ROOM, BOARDING HOUSE - DAY \nSTILL IN SUBJECTIVE CAMERA as the concerned Landlady, cleavage foremost, stands away from us, having patted the unseen Newcomer's face with a washcloth. Beyond her, near the half- open door, stands her Cheerleader Daughter, worriedly chewing on her thumb. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) The Landlady was good at quite a few things, but doctoring wasn't one of them... \nCUT TO REVERSE and see the hero, who this time is actually played by Henry Follett, appearing in his own fantasy for the first time. He's lying in bed, his face bruised in the manner of a fifties movie. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) ...Lucky for me, one of the other boarders, the broad who lived downstairs in the front room... \nBACK AT THE DOOR, the Cheerleader hears someone coming and steps aside to make way for -- Althea Brockett, dressed now in a nurse's uniform so tight the buttons are straining. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) ...was a nurse... \nAs the Landlady and the Cheerleader retreat out the door, Althea the Nurse sways forward toward the bed bearing bandages and a bowl of steaming water, a lascivious look of concern on her face. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) ...and she had ways to make you feel better they didn't teach in nursing school. \nAlthea the Nurse places a bandage over Follett's eyes, BLACKING OUT THE SCENE. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY \nMumford sits beaming at Henry Follett on the couch. Mumford's glance takes in the clock and he stands up, signalling the end of the session. Follett snaps out of his revery and gets up. \nMUMFORD I'm very happy for you, Henry. \nMumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it vigorously. \nMUMFORD I feel like we're making real progress here. \nSuddenly, Sofie's voice cracks. She is starting to cry, but refuses to acknowledge it. \nSOFIE -- We had a paper route together, for godssake! Do you understand how I might be a little resentful? Knowing that this so-called \"love\" I'm feeling is totally bogus, and just a pathetic case of... transference? \nMumford doesn't know what to say. He's on the rack. Finally -- \nMUMFORD Yes. \nSilence. Then Sofie gets up, wiping at tears with the back of her bare hand. Mumford jumps up to offer her a tissue, but she ignores it. She will not meet his gaze. \nSOFIE Maybe you ought to think about how you're going to fix this. And when you do... (suddenly losing her will) ...please get back to me. \nSofie turns to go out through the waiting room, but after a step, she stops, pirouettes and goes out the back. \nEXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - MAGIC \nMumford comes up the street, lost in thought, and turns into the driveway toward his stairs. Ainge leaps over the front yard fence. Mumford pets the dog distractedly, still moving. \nMUMFORD Hey, Ainge. \nLily rises up suddenly from where she's been working in the garden. \nLILY Doc... \nMUMFORD (keeps walking) Lily. \nLILY Doc. \nMumford reluctantly stops. Lily comes up to the fence. \nLILY I don't want you to be mad at Skip... \nMUMFORD He told you. \nLILY (yes) Skip and I wouldn't have got together if it weren't for you. That's a big deal. \nMUMFORD (dismisses it) You would have met in some shower eventually... \nLILY I want to give you something. Will you let me? \nMUMFORD Thanks, Lily, I don't need anything. \nLILY Yes, you do, you damn well do. \nMUMFORD (can't fight) Okay. \nLILY Here it is, some advice -- do the hard thing. \nMUMFORD That's it? That's what you're giving me? \nLILY Clean up the mess. No matter what it takes. \nMumford leans down to pet Ainge. \nMUMFORD What it might take is... doing time. \nLILY Too bad. That's tough, I mean it. I'm not unsympathetic. But Skip says you're in love. \nMumford straightens, looks at Lily and acknowledges it. \nLILY Then it's worth it. \nMumford looks at Lily a long moment, then leans over the fence and kisses her on the forehead. Ainge jumps back over to her side. \nMUMFORD I'll tell her tonight. \nMumford turns and continues toward his stairs. \nINT. MUMFORD'S APARTMENT - MAGIC \nMumford comes in, drops his coat, gets a carton of orange juice out of the fridge and drinks directly from it. Distracted, he picks up the remote from the kitchen counter and switches on the TV, then opens his freezer and stares inside. \nUNSOLVED MYSTERIES comes on. The opening segment previews a story about a couple who claim to have had a visitation from Gianni Versace, then one about a yacht that went down near Venezuela. ROBERT STACK, in his characteristic fragmented delivery, intones the preview for the last story, accompanied by appropriate footage: \nROBERT STACK ...A drug rehabilitation center in the lonely southwestern desert... run by reclusive monks... becomes the point of departure in a mysterious vanishing... \nA CLOSE-UP of an IRS identification card featuring a picture of a younger Mumford, badly photographed in suit and tie. His name is not visible. \nMUMFORD What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook? \nMRS. COOK Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter. \nMUMFORD Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that. \nBoth Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment. Mrs. Cook recovers fastest -- \nMRS. COOK It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister. \nSOFIE (scary strong) Mother... go away! \nMr. Cook suddenly appears, takes Mrs. Cook by the arm and makes her vanish. Sofie and Mumford are left alone. She looks at him through the screen. \nMUMFORD I guess you saw the show...? \nSOFIE Which show was that? \nMUMFORD Sofie... \nSOFIE Part of it. We were watching \"ER\" until someone called. \nMUMFORD You probably got the idea. \nSofie comes outside. She doesn't get too close or look at him as she walks to the other end of the porch. \nSOFIE Do you know what a betrayal this is?... \nMumford knows. \nSOFIE ...How violated I feel? \nMUMFORD You're not the only one... \nSofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up. \nSOFIE You feel violated? \nMUMFORD Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here. \nSOFIE You deserve it. \nMumford agrees. He watches her closely. \nSOFIE I should be irate. \nMumford immediately perks up. Sofie tries to correct -- \nSOFIE I am irate! \nMUMFORD (grabbing at the thread) But... \nSOFIE But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done. \nMUMFORD I know it! Please believe me, I know that... \nMumford steps closer to her. \nMUMFORD But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off. \nSOFIE What? \nMUMFORD Will you think about it? \nSOFIE I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood. \nMUMFORD I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life. \nShe looks into his eyes. \nSOFIE Oh. \nMUMFORD I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way. \nShe regards him for several moments, her mind racing. \nSOFIE I sort of do... \n", "test1_input": "LATER. Dinner is over. Jeremy comes out onto the veranda carrying two Cuban cigars. His casual outfit is as stylish and pricey as his work outfit. He joins Mumford and Althea, who immediately gets up. \nALTHEA I'll be back. \nShe goes inside. The men each have a snifter of cognac. Jeremy makes a ceremony of cutting the cigars -- \nJEREMY I think you'll like this. Know much about Cuban cigars? \nMUMFORD Nope. \nJeremy puts the cigars down, pulls a joint out of his cashmere pullover and fires it up. After exhaling a huge cloud of smoke, he offers the joint to Mumford, who declines. \nJEREMY Makes the whole thing that much better. \nJeremy takes another hit on the joint and puts it down. He gives a cigar and his gold lighter to Mumford, who begins to light up -- \nJEREMY Just hold the flame a little bit below the end... that's it... now just turn it slowly as you draw... \nMumford does as he's told. Jeremy lights his own cigar. \nJEREMY Are you a man who likes to treat himself right? \nMUMFORD I've had my moments. \nJEREMY I am. And I'm not ashamed of it. Nobody ever said on their death bed -- \"I treated myself too well.\" \nMUMFORD I thought it was -- Nobody ever said, \"I should have spent more time at the office.\" \nJEREMY Fill in the blank. I don't mind the office. The point is, you only go 'round once. Like the Zens say -- Be here now. \nMUMFORD What do you do? \nJEREMY Althea hasn't told you? \nMUMFORD (no) We've been talking about her, mostly. \nJEREMY Well, in '85 four of us left our firms and formed an investment banking venture. We've got twenty-three people working there now. \nMUMFORD You've done well. \nThe marijuana is kicking in now -- Jeremy gets a self- satisfied, condescending look on his face that no straight mind would dare. His response includes their lavish immediate surroundings-- \nJEREMY We've done... very well. You know anything about addiction, Doc? \nMUMFORD A little. \nJEREMY Well, I'm addicted to winning. I say when you're in the red zone, you gotta score. (watches Mumford smoke) So what do you think? \nMUMFORD Tastes good. \nJEREMY No... I mean about Althea. About her... (makes a face) ...behavior. Do you think you can fix her up? \nMUMFORD What do you think's wrong with her? \nJEREMY She's gone weird is what's wrong with her. Out of control. Probably from living out here in Mayberry. \nJeremy blows cigar smoke into his snifter, then takes a mouthful of cognac, savoring the sensations. Mumford watches, fascinated by this guy. \nJEREMY You're the doctor, what do you think? \nMUMFORD She seems very unhappy. \nJeremy gives him a look, as if to say \"duh.\" \nJEREMY I think we all knew that, professor. The question... the real -- (drawn out, stoned) -- quest-tio-nee... is... why? \nMumford looks at him a long time. \nEXT. ROAD INTO MUMFORD - NIGHT \nJeremy Brockett's Mercedes 500 SL whips around a curve. \nINT. BROCKETT'S MERCEDES - NIGHT \nMartin is driving Mumford back to town. \nMARTIN But you know how to drive? \n", "test1_true": "MARTIN Got a license? (yes) But no car? \nMUMFORD Don't need it. \nMARTIN I just got my license two weeks ago. \nMUMFORD You're good. \nMARTIN I been drivin' since I was twelve. \nMUMFORD That would explain it. \nMARTIN Can you help Mom? \nMUMFORD I'm trying. \nMARTIN (intense) Got to. \nThey drive in silence for a bit. Then -- \nMARTIN Nessa Watkins... She comes to you, doesn't she? You're treating her, right? \nMumford gives him a surprised look, then acknowledges it. \nMARTIN What's wrong with her? \nMUMFORD Is she a friend of yours? \nMARTIN No... sort of. Man, she could be cool, but all she does is get wrecked and do all the guys. She's blowin' them in the parking lot. \nMumford knew that. \nMARTIN A person's got to hate themselves to act like that. \nMumford regards Martin with respect, then turns to look out front. After a few moments -- \nMARTIN Have you ever met a bigger shithead than my stepfather? \nEXT. THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT \nLily is walking Ainge as the Mercedes pulls up and Mumford gets out. Ainge runs happily around the car and puts his paws up on the driver's door to greet Martin; we HEAR the clicking SCRATCH of his nails on the surface. Martin rubs the dog's head. \nLILY Ainge! \nMARTIN That's okay. Jeremy won't mind. Good dog. \nLILY Ainge! \nThe dog obediently leaves Martin and runs back to Lily. Mumford waves as Martin pulls away. \nLILY (to Ainge) Do we run into the street? No, I didn't think so. (looks after Martin) Nice car. How's that place? \nMUMFORD It's a pretty piece of land. \nThey walk up the block with the dog. \nLILY And the Brocketts? \nMUMFORD Horror show. What'd you do tonight? \nLILY It was insane here, man. 'Hadda call in the National Guard. (he nods) Then I did my laundry... watched \nMUMFORD ...And? \nLILY Shocking. Did you know the government is wasteful? (Mumford reacts) You heard it here first. Oh, and being a supermodel... it's no walk in the park. \nMUMFORD Why do you watch? \nLILY No gentleman caller, Doc. (they turn back) Not that I care. I've had it with men. They're so fascinated by their own crap. Took me four years to get the last one out. Almost turned me into a dyke... These days my idea of a hot date is a long shower by myself before bed. Now that feels good. And you don't have to do all that... listening. \nMumford laughs. \nLILY Oops... sorry. I guess that's the story of your life. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nTIGHT ON COMPUTER SCREEN. A health information \"library\" website has been called up on Mumford's office computer. Right now it's beginning to spew information about \"CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME\" -- Definitions, Signs and Symptoms, Diagnostic Measures, etc. \n", "test1_id": 1092, "test2_input": "Sofie's not sure how to take that. She looks away. \nMUMFORD There... I've given myself a real whopper. \nSOFIE You actually address yourself by name in your thoughts? (Mumford laughs) So you really think having two opposing ideas in your head does some kind of damage? \nMUMFORD Sometimes, yeah... pulling in two different directions at once. It makes tiny little tears in our fabric. \nSOFIE Well then, my life has been some kind of huge rip. \nINT. BOARDING HOUSE (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - DAY \nThe handsome Newcomer of Follett's fantasy comes down the steps from the attic wearing a sleeveless undershirt, towel thrown over his shoulder. He goes into the bathroom off the second floor hall and begins to wash up. [Again, Follett's fantasy world is in BLACK & WHITE.] \nFOLLETT (V.O.) The town was a rube's heaven, but I found work my first day out down at Old Man Sutter's gas station and diner. I knew his stacked young wife was going to be a problem, but, hey, life is full of problems. Back at the boarding house, I was washing up when I heard a load of yellin' and -- \nIN THE BATHROOM MIRROR, the Newcomer's POV: a nubile teenager, 17 going on 35, in a tight cheerleader's outfit, comes up the stairs and stops at the top to turn and yell back down at her mother. Her dialogue distant and echoey: \nLANDLADY'S DAUGHTER ...get off my case! You don't like any of my friends... \nFOLLETT (V.O.) ...I got my first look at the landlady's daughter. \nThe LANDLADY'S DAUGHTER looks up and sees the Newcomer watching her through the half-open bathroom door. She gives him a petulant, white-hot look, then turns on her heel and goes into her room at that end of the hall. She bangs her door behind her, but it bounces open again about a foot. The Newcomer, still watching in the bathroom mirror, now has a view of the bureau mirror in the Landlady's Daughter's room. In there, seemingly oblivious, the girl quickly strips off the top of her outfit, revealing a '50's-era white bra. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) Lucky for me, she was plenty upset but not too careful. \nSuddenly, in mirror reflection of mirror, the Landlady's Daughter meets the Newcomer's smoldering stare and her lip begins to curl. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) Or maybe it wasn't an accident at all -- \nMUMFORD (V.O.) Mr. Follett. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) -- 'cause in that instant I saw the beginning of a vixen's smile and I knew -- \nMUMFORD (V.O.) Henry! \nMysteriously, the door to the girl's bedroom slams shut, cutting off the Newcomer's view. He looks with surprise into his mirror -- it suddenly shatters. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nFollett sits up abruptly on the couch and twists toward Mumford, agitated. \nFOLLETT What? \nMUMFORD Stop now. \nFOLLETT Why? I'm paying for this. \nMUMFORD Not for this. Not me, you're not. \nFOLLETT (challenging) You find it distasteful, don't you? \nMUMFORD It doesn't matter how I feel about it. It's how you feel about it that matters. \nFOLLETT I enjoy it. Does that make me some kind of pervert? Just because a man has a rich imaginative life -- \nMUMFORD You didn't come to me because you have a rich imagination. \nFOLLETT No? \nMUMFORD You came because it's taking over. You're in its grip. \nFOLLETT I never said that. \nMumford's tone suddenly picks up a touch of steel. \nMUMFORD Where's your wife, Henry? \nFollett flinches, settles back down onto the couch, sulking. \nMUMFORD Where's your wife, Henry? \nFOLLETT Go to hell. \nMUMFORD (softer) I didn't hear you. \nFollett mutters something to himself, then is silent until -- \n", "test2_true": "MUMFORD (shouts, Follett jumps) What?! \nFollett seems to shrink in size. They've been here before and he doesn't like it. \nFOLLETT (softly) I was... never satisfied. \nMUMFORD (normal again) Now we're back on track. \nAgain, Follett says something under his breath. \nMUMFORD What's that? \nFOLLETT (long beat) You are so mean. \nEXT. HIKING TRAIL - MAGIC \nMumford strides up the trail on his late day excursion. He comes around a bend and is surprised to find Skip waiting for him, looking serious. \nMUMFORD Hey, Skip. \nSKIP Doc. I know we're not supposed to get together till Wednesday... \nMUMFORD That's all right. What's on your mind? \nMumford indicates that Skip should walk with him up the trail. \nSKIP How many sessions have we had now, Doc? (Mumford tries to remember) Six. And it's been good... like we were two buddies hanging out. Just shootin' the shit. \nMUMFORD Yep. \nThey walk in silence for a while. \nSKIP This is really hard. Everything I want to say is hard... \nEXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC \nMumford and Skip come out of the trees, climb onto the big rock, and settle down. The sun is falling over the town of Mumford. \nSKIP ...We're like friends, almost... who trust each other. \nHe checks Mumford's reaction. Mumford nods, offers Skip water, who turns it down. Mumford takes a swig. \nSKIP I want to tell you something, Doc, but before I do, I need to ask you a question... Because, for me to tell you this thing -- well, I haven't told anybody about this. It's the biggest secret I've got. \nMUMFORD Sometimes it's best to keep a few things just for ourselves. \nSKIP You're a shrink, Doc. Aren't I supposed to be able to tell you everything? \nMUMFORD It's just a thought. \nSkip, even more unsure now, looks away, at the town below. \nSKIP That really relates to the thing I want to ask you... I've noticed that sometimes, not a lot, but sometimes, when we're hanging out, throwin' the ball... or that time we went bowling... sometimes you'll like -- (gets it out fast --) -- tell me things about your other patients. \nMumford lets that hang a few moments, then acknowledges it silently. Now Skip is even more nervous. \nSKIP Hey, maybe that's all right! I don't know all that much about psychology or therapy or... ethics, so maybe there's something I missed... or something... \nMUMFORD You're concerned that maybe I can't be trusted with a secret. \nSKIP I trust you. Definitely. No question. But, yeah, I'm a little concerned. I mean, you're not supposed to tell anyone about your patients' problems... are you? \nMumford looks at Skip for a long moment. \nMUMFORD That is correct, Skip. I'm going to have to take a long look at that. \nThe conversation seems to end there. Skip's not sure where to go next. Finally -- \nSKIP Yeah, well... what I was gonna tell you -- \nMUMFORD -- Skip. Knowing what you do about me -- \nSKIP Doc, I trust you! You've listened to me better than anybody... maybe ever. (leans in, intense) And this secret I've got, I can't stand it anymore. I don't know if I'm some kind of -- \nSkip looks around at the darkening woods, though clearly there's no one around. \nSKIP -- I don't know if I'm a pervert or what. It's taken me this long to get where I can come out and say it... I can't back away now. I can't spend another day not knowing if I'm nuts. \n", "test2_id": 1093, "test3_input": "A STACK OF BOOKS. The ones on top are lifted away. The bottom book is opened to reveal the birth certificate. It has been folded in an official way. Now Mumford unfolds it, then refolds it differently -- with its smudges and creases, it's starting to look old. \nSKIP (V.O.) And a birth certificate is enough? \nMUMFORD (V.O.) Everything flows from that, and what doesn't... can be easily purchased. \nSERIES OF SHOTS of Mumford's DOCUMENTATION PILING UP. A post office box is emptied, official-looking correspondence is opened, the bounty is laid out for perusal: Social Security card, driver's license, college and graduate school diplomas, license and accreditation to operate as a therapist. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) Of course, my IRS training made it easier. Once you've done that, there's not much data you can't access and use any way you want. \nEXT. SECOND FLOOR PORCH, THE DUPLEX HOUSE - NIGHT \nMUMFORD In a free society, you are who you say you are. (smiling) People should remember that before they go around knocking this country. (he gets up) Skip, all this beer's got me sleepy. \nSkip looks upset. \nSKIP But you studied psychology, right? You did the training and just never got the degree? \nMUMFORD No... no training. \nSKIP (hopeful) Psych major? \nMUMFORD English Lit. \nSKIP Jeez, man. But you're good at it! \nMUMFORD I understand what it's like to want to leave a problem behind. That's all most people are looking to do. (shrugs) Mainly, I listen. \nHe heads inside. \nSKIP Where ya going? I've got a million questions. \nMUMFORD See you Thursday... regular time. \nMumford goes inside. Skip nods, head spinning. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - SUNRISE \nMumford and Sofie are delivering newspapers in lovely first light. Mumford has a canvas sack full of newspapers around his neck. At each house, he consults the list in his hand, then hands Sofie a rolled-up paper, which she throws -- with varying success -- toward the front doors. The activity is tiring for her, but she's committed. \nSOFIE ...so we get on this incredible steam engine train that runs up into the mountains... (she tosses a paper, grunting) ...and this trip is everything it's cracked up to be... an open car, great views, the mountain air blowing through. We're sitting there, married for six years, and he says how he likes it better when I put my hair back... \nMumford hands her another paper, which she heaves with all her limited strength, missing the front porch badly. Mumford, who can't get enough of watching her, doesn't notice at first. \nSOFIE That wasn't so good. \nMumford snaps out of it. He goes up on the lawn and flips the paper deftly onto the porch. As they continue -- \nMUMFORD You're doing great. \nSOFIE I don't know if I'm going to make it the whole way. \nMUMFORD It doesn't matter. Go on. \nSOFIE Oh... this makes me sound irrational, which is probably right, but there was something about him saying this -- it was maybe the millionth time he'd told me about some preference of his. Well, I was so... tired of it. (memories) Seems like my whole life someone's been telling me... I'm just not getting it right. Can we rest for a second? \nShe leans against the iron handrail on some front steps, breathing hard. \nSOFIE You're purposely making me talk while we do this... (Mumford nods) ...because you think this is good for me... (nods again) ...and you're a sadistic bastard... \nMUMFORD Yes. \nSOFIE ...who thinks there's nothing really wrong with me. \nMUMFORD Oh, there's something wrong with you, all right. Especially after hearing that dream of yours, about the Roto-Rooter. \nShe laughs. They're playing with each other. \nSOFIE That was really bad, wasn't it? \nMUMFORD Disgusting. \nSOFIE And I'll bet you can interpret the whole thing \nMUMFORD It's pretty obvious to a trained professional. \nSofie starts walking again, taking another newspaper from his sack. He points to the next house. \n", "test3_true": "Sofie heaves the paper squarely onto the porch. She turns to him with pride, but when she sees the way he looks at her, she glances away, uncomfortable. \nMUMFORD Is that when you split up? \nSOFIE No, that'd be a good story, but that was just the beginning of the end. We went on for another year or so. \nMumford hands her another paper and indicates the next house. \nSOFIE So whose route is this? \nMUMFORD Brady Peck's. Fourteen years old. Lives next door. \nSOFIE And he's where? \nMUMFORD In the capitol for Boy's Nation. Five days. Why? \nSOFIE (heaves another paper) I'm thinking a gal could make a good living doing this. How hard could it be squeezing out some fourteen year old? \nMUMFORD You like it? \nSOFIE It's all right. \nMUMFORD Then you can expect me at 5:30 tomorrow morning. \nSOFIE And this is legitimate therapy? \nMUMFORD Therapy? Hell no, I just don't want to do it alone. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nTIGHT ON RAPID SERIES OF IMAGES on slick, glossy magazine pages: each change of image is punctuated by the AMPLIFIED SNAP of the page being turned, like a gunshot. We're SO CLOSE to the images we can't tell when the magazines change -- from Glamour to Vogue to Us to Mademoiselle to W to Vanity Fair. And it doesn't matter. Whether the images are ads or fashion spreads or celebrity candids, the look is the same -- jaded, hip, disinterested, apathetic, either impossibly buff or anorexic, but always severely beautiful. The PAGE TURNING starts at a fevered pitch and becomes even more intense. Finally -- \nMUMFORD (V.O.) What is it, Nessa? \nThe IMAGES CONTINUE. \nNESSA (V.O.) Isn't she amazing? That is such a wicked look. \nMUMFORD (V.O.) What do you want me to see? \nNESSA (V.O.) Just chill for a second. Look at this guy, it appears he's actually dead... but gorgeous. \nMumford is sitting next to Nessa on the couch. At their feet is a mess of magazines. Nessa discards one and immediately starts flipping through a new one beneath it. She is very agitated. Mumford stands up, walks over and sits in his chair. \nNESSA What are you doing? We're not done. I just need to find the thing... \nMUMFORD If you don't want to have a session today, it's okay. \nNESSA I want to have the session. I thought it would be cool if I could show you some of the things that interest me. But I guess you're not into it... which we already knew. \nMUMFORD What happened today? \nNESSA What are you talking about? \nMUMFORD Was it something that happened at school? \nNESSA (petulant) These appointments were not my idea, remember. \nMUMFORD True. Should we stop them? \nA look of panic crosses Nessa's face, but she instantly hides it, busily taking out cigarette and lighter, which she doesn't use. Instead, she lies down on the couch, balancing the closed magazine on her chest. \nNESSA I don't think you know what you're talking about. \nMUMFORD Uh-huh. \nNESSA This shrink school you went to... did you hear about it on an infomercial? \nMumford waits. Nessa refers to the magazine beneath her chin. \nNESSA I want to live in the world these people are in. No one ever says anything in there, have you noticed? So they're very cool. Like they're all really deep. It's when people start talking that everything goes to shit. \nNessa suddenly seems on the edge of tears, but beats it back. \nNESSA There's this kid at school... Martin Brockett. He has some gigantic idea of himself that no one else shares. You wouldn't believe the crap he lays on me... Who appointed him my spiritual leader? If he has everything so figured out how come his best friend is a .22 rifle? And why's he spend all his time chasing after me? Probably thinks I'm gonna give him a hummer... \nMUMFORD Do you think that's what he wants? \n", "test3_id": 1094}

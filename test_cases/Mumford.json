{"test1_input": "NESSA You really need to let people smoke in here, you know. It's perverse. What are they paying you to see me? \nMumford indicates \"nothing\". \nNESSA The school board doesn't pay you? What kind of deal is that? \nMUMFORD It's called pro bono. \nNESSA Pro boner? (he waits her out) Pro bono, huh? For whose good, supposedly? \nMUMFORD It's my bit for the community. \nNESSA Fuck the community. (he won't go for it) There was this article my friends and I read. It was \"25 Signs He's Great in Bed\". It was very fascinating. \nMUMFORD Where was this? \nNESSA Where?... The New York Times. The first one was -- \"he handles produce well.\" Which we already knew! (an expression she uses) The point is, you have a lot of the signs. \nMUMFORD You been spying on me in the supermarket, Nessa? \nNESSA Have women found you attractive? \nMumford laughs. \nNESSA I knew you wouldn't answer. I've been thinking about what you said last time. How me trying to lose weight -- and constantly not -- is like a lot of people with addictions. How maybe I can't lose the weight, ever... (quietly) Which we already knew... \nMUMFORD That's not quite what I said -- \nNESSA It's a really weird thing for a shrink to say... and then you said maybe people'd be happier if they'd accept that some things don't change -- that it'd be some kind of a relief or something... \nMumford waits. \nNESSA Well, I guess I'm just a dumb bitch, but how depressing is that moment -- the moment when you give up? \nEXT. HIKING TRAIL, MOUNTAIN FOREST - MAGIC \nThe last rays of sun are fighting their way through the trees as Mumford comes up the trail he clearly knows very well. \nEXT. BIG ROCK LOOKOUT POINT - MAGIC \nMumford climbs out on the Big Rock, settles himself on the edge and takes a long drink from a water bottle. \nWHAT HE SEES: far below at the foot of these hills, lights just twinkling on, is the town of Mumford. He stares at it for several long moments. Then he takes a small headlamp from his pack and fits the straps over his head (it looks like a miner's light). He twists the light on to test it and turns his head to watch the beam move about. \nWE CUT BACK WIDE. After a beat, Mumford settles back and turns off the light. \nINT. SCATTERGOOD'S TAVERN - NIGHT \nThe place is quietly busy with the regulars. Mumford has a favorite spot at the far end of the bar. Right now he's sitting alone, reading the remnants of a newspaper. \nSKIP SKIPPERTON, the man on the skateboard, comes in. Everyone in the bar is surprised to see Skip in here. Several patrons greet him as he makes his way deeper inside, looking around. He's uncomfortable. He seems relieved when he spots Mumford and heads back there. Mumford doesn't notice Skip waiting for his attention. \nSKIP Hi. \nMumford looks up, smiles. Skip offers his hand. \nSKIP You're Doc Mumford. (Mumford nods) Skip Skipperton. \nMUMFORD How are you? \nSKIP Fine. Okay. Pretty good. I've been hoping we'd meet. I've heard a lot about you. \nMumford waits, friendly. Skip runs out of gas, gets uneasy, glances around. \nSKIP Do you think we could...? Can I buy you a drink? \nCUT TO: \nLATER. IN A BOOTH near the back. They've been at it a while, but nothing is clear to Mumford, yet. Skip keeps his voice down; he doesn't want anyone else in the bar to hear him. \nSKIP ...\"Find the need and fill it\" my dad used to say -- I guess a lot of dads say that -- but I did and it just took off. \nMUMFORD No kidding... Panda. Where'd that come from? \nSKIP Panda? I've always liked giant pandas... I've been to China and seen them in the wild. That's the kind of thing I can do if I want... now. I can do pretty much anything I want to do these days. \nSkip stares into his beer for a moment, as though the thought depresses him. He catches himself and snaps back -- \n", "test1_true": "Skip glances around, leans in, confidential. \nSKIP When I was growing up here, the town was about dead. The timber business was played out... Panda changed all that. Now, just about everybody in town either works for the company or depends on it somehow. Which is kinda the problem... \nMumford waits, watches. Skip gets uncomfortable. \nSKIP Would you like another beer? \nMUMFORD Nah... scotch. \nSKIP (brightens, like a kid) Far out. Single malt? (gets up) Can I pick it? \nSkip heads off to the bar. Mumford looks around. Everybody is watching. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nLATER. The bar crowd has thinned. Both Mumford and Skip have had a few. In fact, Mumford is now carefully pouring them each another drink from a bottle of Glensomething on the table. \nMUMFORD You want me... to be... your friend. \nSkip beams. Mumford leans forward in the same confidential way Skip did before; he indicates that Skip should lean in too. Mumford is almost whispering -- \nMUMFORD But that's not what's really going on... (Skip is excited) ...What's really going on is... you have some problems and you want some therapy, but you feel it could be very bad for Panda Modem stock if word got out that you were having head problems. \nSkip confirms that's it. \nMUMFORD Can I ask you a personal question? \nSKIP Of course! That's exactly what I want. \nMUMFORD Have you thought about getting a wife? \nSkip makes a face and gesture to indicate a large \"YES!\", but also total frustration and failure. \nSKIP When Panda started to happen, I was dating women from New York, San Francisco, L.A. They came out of the woodwork. Models, actresses, venture capitalists... These were not the kind of girls who were interested in me before I hit it... And you know what I discovered? I discovered these girls did not love me for myself. The majority of them didn't even like me. But a lot of them would've gladly become Mrs. Skipperton for a while. Can you imagine that -- marrying someone just because they've got money? \nMumford considers that. \nSKIP I gotta pee. (he gets up, a little wobbly) Can I ask you something? This town is called Mumford... Been that way since... 18... 18-0... 18-0... (finally remembers) ...thirteen! Right? (Mumford: if you say so) Now here's the question -- Your name is Mumford, too. \nMUMFORD Is that the question? \nSKIP You moved here from back East and your name is the same as this town. Is that right? (Mumford shrugs) Far out. \nSkip takes a few steps toward the men's room, then comes back and leans down toward Mumford. \nSKIP I hope you don't think I want you to do this for free. Just because we're gonna play it like we're friends, doesn't mean I won't pay you like a doctor. \nMUMFORD I understand. \nSKIP I have a lot of money. Do you know how much money I've got? \nMUMFORD Don't tell me, 'cause I'm not going to tell you what I've got. \nSKIP I've got three big ones. \nMUMFORD I'm impressed. I couldn't make three million dollars if I lived three lifetimes. \nSKIP No, no... I have three billion dollars. \nSkip stumbles off to take a leak. Mumford takes a moment to digest that. It's difficult. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nMumford is listening to Lionel, the arrogant lawyer who asked about him in the restaurant. Lionel is lying on the couch, talking with enormous energy; he has a serious superiority complex. Mumford can't stand him and the session seems to be lasting an eternity. \nLIONEL ...so I'm watching Brokaw and they've got some astronomer, this little limey know-it-all, and he's telling how, with this Himball telescope, they've discovered there are maybe 400 million more galaxies than they thought there were. And I guess that's supposed to make me feel small? I'm supposed to feel insignificant? Is that the point? Because I can tell you it didn't. \nMumfords eyes dart to look at -- \nTHE CLOCK on the bookshelf: 2:23 \nMUMFORD Lionel, since this is our first session together, maybe -- \nLionel is twisting his neck around painfully to look back at Mumford. \nMUMFORD -- you can sit up and look at me if you'd like -- (Lionel waves that off and looks away) -- maybe it would be helpful if you told me a little about what brought you here. \n", "test1_id": 1092, "test2_input": "SKIP (O.S.) Far out! \nMumford smiles. He gets up and goes inside, closing the door behind him so as not to violate their privacy. He goes to the suitcase, takes out some clothes and begins putting them back in the dresser. Right now, he's not going anywhere. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - DAY \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP of Ernest Delbanco. We can't tell where he is at first. As he speaks, we PULL BACK to REVEAL him lying on Mumford's couch -- a patient. \nDELBANCO ...and when you said at lunch about everybody having \"a secret life\", something just snapped inside me. I knew I could no longer continue my relationship with Dr. Sheeler. It was tearing me up inside. And I know Phyllis wasn't getting what she needed from it. What had started as a genuine respect, I think, for each other's professional abilities, and became, over time, a personal attraction had somehow... migrated into a rather torrid sexual relationship... \nAcross the room, Mumford sits, chin in hand, displaying no reaction. \nDELBANCO ...I won't go into that today. Though, if we should continue these sessions, as I certainly hope we will, there are some aspects of that I would like to look at. God knows, I've listened to enough people giving me the juicy -- (catches himself) ...At any rate, I just wanted to acknowledge the catalyzing effect your comment had on me. I just hope that it doesn't come roiling back upon you like some dreadful undertow. \nMUMFORD How do you mean? \nThis next is painful for Delbanco. \nDELBANCO Well... you see, when I broke it off with Phyllis, she was naturally upset and she became more determined than ever to pursue certain -- how to put it -- doubts she's been harboring... \nMUMFORD What kind of doubts? \nDELBANCO About you... your background and your qualifications. I'm afraid Phyllis somehow got you mixed up in her fury with me, and actually took the whole issue to the state board. \nMumford digests this. \nMUMFORD I see. \nDELBANCO And please, for whatever small way I may have encouraged this, accept my apologies. (brightens) There is good news, though. \nMUMFORD What's that? \nDELBANCO Phyllis has decided to leave town and pursue her practice in the city. Which leaves you the only psychologist in town. \nMUMFORD Dr. Sheeler is leaving Mumford? I'm sorry to hear that. \nDELBANCO As you can imagine, my own feelings about this are mixed... Unlike, I must say, those of my wife. \nMumford's head snaps up. He had no idea Delbanco was married. \nEXT. GAS STATION, SMALL TOWN (IN HENRY FOLLETT'S FANTASY) - DAY \nWe (CAMERA) are being pummelled by three SMALL TOWN TOUGHS behind Old Man Sutter's gas station/diner in the Follett's fantasy town. [In BLACK & WHITE.] Beyond them, Old Man Sutter's stacked YOUNG WIFE watches in horror from the backdoor of the building. We DO NOT SEE The Newcomer yet. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) Old Man Sutter's young bride had got me in hot water all right, and now I was bein' dealt the beating of my life. If there'd just been two of those bastards it would have been a little closer... \nOne of the Toughs winds up and delivers the coup de grace. CUT TO BLACK, then FADE UP ON: \nINT. ATTIC ROOM, BOARDING HOUSE - DAY \nSTILL IN SUBJECTIVE CAMERA as the concerned Landlady, cleavage foremost, stands away from us, having patted the unseen Newcomer's face with a washcloth. Beyond her, near the half- open door, stands her Cheerleader Daughter, worriedly chewing on her thumb. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) The Landlady was good at quite a few things, but doctoring wasn't one of them... \nCUT TO REVERSE and see the hero, who this time is actually played by Henry Follett, appearing in his own fantasy for the first time. He's lying in bed, his face bruised in the manner of a fifties movie. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) ...Lucky for me, one of the other boarders, the broad who lived downstairs in the front room... \nBACK AT THE DOOR, the Cheerleader hears someone coming and steps aside to make way for -- Althea Brockett, dressed now in a nurse's uniform so tight the buttons are straining. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) ...was a nurse... \nAs the Landlady and the Cheerleader retreat out the door, Althea the Nurse sways forward toward the bed bearing bandages and a bowl of steaming water, a lascivious look of concern on her face. \nFOLLETT (V.O.) ...and she had ways to make you feel better they didn't teach in nursing school. \nAlthea the Nurse places a bandage over Follett's eyes, BLACKING OUT THE SCENE. \nINT. MUMFORD'S OFFICE - (PRESENT) DAY \nMumford sits beaming at Henry Follett on the couch. Mumford's glance takes in the clock and he stands up, signalling the end of the session. Follett snaps out of his revery and gets up. \nMUMFORD I'm very happy for you, Henry. \nMumford, surprisingly, takes Follett's hand and shakes it vigorously. \nMUMFORD I feel like we're making real progress here. \n", "test2_true": "Mumford stops him with a \"don't mention it\" gesture. Follett accepts and goes out the back door. Mumford is pleased someone still wants to use that door. \nMumford returns to his desk and begins reading some papers when he HEARS the entry door to the waiting room. Not expecting anyone, he checks the clock, then goes to his office door and opens it. \nSofie is standing there, very agitated, just about to knock. She peers past him to see if he's alone. \nSOFIE I need to talk to you... Doctor. Can I come in? \nMUMFORD Of course. \nSofie sits on the couch. Mumford sits in his chair, facing her. Her voice is as strained as her manner. \nSOFIE We haven't met in this office since that first time. This is how a real professional and his client are supposed to see each other. \nMumford waits. \nSOFIE It might've been more appropriate if we had followed a traditional approach to the doctor-patient relationship. \nMUMFORD Is something wrong, Sofie? \nSOFIE Yes, something's very wrong, Dr. Mumford. \nMUMFORD You're upset. \nSOFIE How intuitive! That must take years of training right there. Maybe you can guess what has upset me. \nMumford considers a long moment, several scenarios racing through his mind. Finally, carefully -- \nMUMFORD Is it something you've heard about me? \nSOFIE No, it is not something I've heard about you! It is someth-- (stops suddenly) Why? Is there something I should have heard about you? \nMUMFORD Why don't you tell me what's on your mind? \nSofie suddenly finds it difficult to look into his eyes, she looks around frenetically for a moment. Then, indicating the couch -- \nSOFIE May I? \nMumford gestures \"of course.\" Sofie swings her legs up and lies on the couch so they can no longer see each other's face. (It's the most vigorous movement she's yet shown us.) This seems to help Sofie a bit. \nSOFIE All right... I'm going to come right out and say this, because that's what your shrink is for, right, so you can tell him what's bothering you? \nMUMFORD Um-huh. \nSOFIE (tone still rough) First of all, I have been feeling much better lately. I don't know if the syndrome is over -- if it's just run its course or something -- but I feel a hundred per cent better than when I first came to you. \nMUMFORD I'm glad. \nSOFIE Given that, I'm obviously not going to be judging things in the most realistic way. \nMUMFORD I don't follow you. \nSOFIE (sharply) I'm saying that since I'm doing so much better -- which I attribute to you -- I'm liable to misinterpret some of my feelings. \nMUMFORD (tentative) Okay... \nSOFIE The point is this -- I am not a blank page. I did not just fall off the turnip truck. Do you know what I mean? \nMUMFORD I think so. \nSOFIE I know a little about psychology. I took three different courses in college. It's true, none of them were above the two hundred level, but I took them... And there was one concept I remember very well. \nMUMFORD What was that? \nSOFIE Transference! \nMUMFORD Transference. \nSOFIE Yes, and that is what I have got right now. I have taken my feelings of gratitude... and relief... and transferred them onto... you. I have taken all those warm, grateful emotions and confused them with feelings for you... So that now I am under the delusion... (a deep breath) ...that I am in love with you. \nMumford appears frozen in his chair. There is a heavy silence in the room. Sofie does not look back there. \nSOFIE Hello? \nMUMFORD Hello. \nSOFIE I think you can understand why I have some serious questions about your methods. I mean, obviously it becomes much more likely that I'm going to have confusion about this when your idea of treatment is to go walking in the woods and up to make- outs-ville and do all these highly romantic activities -- \n", "test2_id": 1093, "test3_input": "MUMFORD What do you think I'm after, Mrs. Cook? \nMRS. COOK Sofie. It's so obvious... you're after my daughter. \nMUMFORD Well, I gotta say, Mrs. Cook, you're right about that. \nBoth Sofie and Mrs. Cook are set back for a moment. Mrs. Cook recovers fastest -- \nMRS. COOK It'll never happen! You're in big trouble, mister. \nSOFIE (scary strong) Mother... go away! \nMr. Cook suddenly appears, takes Mrs. Cook by the arm and makes her vanish. Sofie and Mumford are left alone. She looks at him through the screen. \nMUMFORD I guess you saw the show...? \nSOFIE Which show was that? \nMUMFORD Sofie... \nSOFIE Part of it. We were watching \"ER\" until someone called. \nMUMFORD You probably got the idea. \nSofie comes outside. She doesn't get too close or look at him as she walks to the other end of the porch. \nSOFIE Do you know what a betrayal this is?... \nMumford knows. \nSOFIE ...How violated I feel? \nMUMFORD You're not the only one... \nSofie turns sharply to look at him, ready to blow up. \nSOFIE You feel violated? \nMUMFORD Not me... all my other my patients. I smelled tar and feathers on the way over here. \nSOFIE You deserve it. \nMumford agrees. He watches her closely. \nSOFIE I should be irate. \nMumford immediately perks up. Sofie tries to correct -- \nSOFIE I am irate! \nMUMFORD (grabbing at the thread) But... \nSOFIE But nothing... I'm mad as hell. This is a terrible thing you've done. \nMUMFORD I know it! Please believe me, I know that... \nMumford steps closer to her. \nMUMFORD But, there is one... mitigating factor I want you to consider before you write me off. \nSOFIE What? \nMUMFORD Will you think about it? \nSOFIE I don't know. Depends. I'm in a bad mood. \nMUMFORD I love you. More than I've ever loved anyone or anything in my life. \nShe looks into his eyes. \nSOFIE Oh. \nMUMFORD I want to spend the rest of my life with you... but I'm not sure you feel the same way. \nShe regards him for several moments, her mind racing. \nSOFIE I sort of do... \n", "test3_true": "SOFIE ...but first, you have to tell me something... \nMUMFORD Anything... just ask. \nSOFIE What is your name? \nAs Mumford breaks into a huge grin, CUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM, MUMFORD COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY \nMumford is at the defense table. Lionel is his lawyer. Sofie, Mr. Cook and Ben sit right behind the rail. \nJUDGE OTTO (O.S.) The defendant will rise. \nMumford and Lionel stand up. \nJUDGE OTTO (O.S.) Sit down, Lionel. \nLionel sits down, squelched again. We see JUDGE OTTO for the first time, a tough guy in his sixties. \nJUDGE OTTO Clarence Norman White, do you understand how serious are the crimes with which you have been charged? \nMUMFORD I do. \nJUDGE OTTO Do you realize how insidious it is to invade the most private thoughts and secret lives of unsuspecting people?... \nWE SEE there's a pretty big turnout for this hearing. Prominent among the onlookers: Lily and Skip, sitting together; Nessa and Martin, holding hands; Dr. Delbanco and MRS. DELBANCO. Gilroy, from the State Certification Board, sits with the PROSECUTOR. \nJUDGE OTTO ...People who have come to you with the faith that you know what you're doing... and that you are who you say you are? \nMUMFORD Yes, your honor. \nJUDGE OTTO It means absolutely nothing to me that so many of your patients have come forward with praise for you and your therapeutic skills. You understand that? \nMUMFORD Yes. \nFollett is sitting in one of the back rows, apparently alone. But now he looks down the row. Althea is sitting down at the end in a stylish suit, completely appropriate, but a size too small. \nShe gives Follett a sidelong glance, then crosses her legs provocatively. Whatever fantasy they're currently enacting is working really well for both of them. \nJUDGE OTTO Mr. White, I am frustrated that the criminal code in this state allows a maximum sentence of only six months and a maximum fine of only $2000. \nMUMFORD I'm sorry, your honor. \nJUDGE OTTO What? \nMUMFORD I'm sorry you're frustrated. \nJUDGE OTTO Are you disrespecting this court, Mr. White? \nMUMFORD No, sir. I was empathizing. Sorry. \nJUDGE OTTO Maybe you can empathize with this -- Maximum fine. Three months in jail, three months house arrest. Sentence to begin immediately at the Orchard Valley Correctional Facility. Case closed. This court is adjourned. \nThe judge slams down his gavel, stands up and stalks out. A DEPUTY moves in to take custody of Mumford. Lionel stands up and leans in -- \nLIONEL It's a country club. Don't worry about it. \nMUMFORD Thanks for your help, Lionel. \nMumford turns to face the Cooks. Mr. Cook and Ben shake his hand like he's just won something. Lionel addresses them all with his usual self-satisfaction -- \nLIONEL I'll have him out in half the time. \nWE PUSH IN on Mumford and Sofie, who embrace. \nSOFIE You got off easy. \nMUMFORD Will you wait for me? \nSOFIE We're only talking about six weeks. \nMUMFORD Will you be here? \nSOFIE Of course... I haven't got the energy to get out of town that fast. \nThey kiss. The Deputy takes Mumford's arm, and we -- \n", "test3_id": 1094}

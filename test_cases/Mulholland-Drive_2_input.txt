RITA (still staring at the nameplate - thinking) No. Just the coffee. 
BETTY We'll take our check. 
Diane searches through her many checks to find Betty and Rita's. 
The manager of Denny's, standing with a woman in a blue dress, calls Diane's name. Diane turns and looks to the manager and the woman. A fleeting fear goes through her eyes. She surreptitiously reaches in her pocket and takes out a Mont Blanc fountain pen which she puts under Betty's check as she places it on their table. She does this very quickly but Betty notices this and Diane notices Betty noticing. Diane walks quickly over to the manager and the woman in the blue dress. Betty turns and watches a heated conversation that she can't hear, but she sees the woman in the blue dress searching her purse and shrugging and then leaving. 
The manager says something to Diane and Diane turns her pockets inside out and pats herself down in front of the manager showing him her innocence. He waves her off and she goes behind the counter to retrieve an order of food. Betty stops watching and turns her attention to Rita, who is tense and lost in a thought. 
BETTY (cont'd) What is it Rita? 
RITA (without moving a muscle) Shhhh. 
At that moment Diane the waitress reappears at their table. Diane looks Betty in the eye and while looking at Betty her left hand slides the Mont Blanc out from under the check and back into her pocket. 
DIANE Thank you. Come in again. 
Betty holds her gaze. 
BETTY You're welcome. We will. 
Relieved Diane leaves and goes about her business. Betty looks over at Rita waiting for her to tell her something. Rita slowly turns and focuses on Betty. 
RITA I remember something... I remember something! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. - HAVENHURST - DAY 
Betty and Rita are walking back to the apartment. We see them from a distance. They are talking and gesturing in an excited and animated way. Just after they enter through the iron gates of 1612 Havenhurst and are out of sight we notice a car moving slowly up Havenhurst toward us. We notice two men in the front seat who seem to be looking around for something. 
CUT TO: 
INT. - AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - DAY 
The door slams shut. Rita grabs Betty's shoulders. 
RITA Diane Selwyn. Maybe it's my name. 
CUT TO: 
AUNT RUTH'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER 
Betty and Rita are sitting next to each other on the leather couch. Betty is rifling through the phone book. She finds the listings for Selwyn. Her finger drifts down and finds D. Selwyn followed by an address and phone number. It is the only Selwyn with a D. first name. She hands the phone to Rita. 
BETTY Strange to be calling yourself. 
RITA Maybe it's not me. 
BETTY Call the number. 
Betty reads the number off and Rita pushes the corresponding buttons. Each tone seems to be louder than the last. The ringing seems deafening. There's a click and the phone is answered - by a machine. A woman's voice is heard - loudly. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (coming from answering machine) Hi ... this is me. Leave me a message. 
Betty now has her ear pressed up against the phone also - straining to hear everything. The machine starts recording. Betty hangs up the phone immediately. 
RITA It's not my voice ... but I know her. 
BETTY Maybe the voice isn't Diane Selwyn. Maybe that's your roommate or if it is Diane Selwyn she can tell you who you are.

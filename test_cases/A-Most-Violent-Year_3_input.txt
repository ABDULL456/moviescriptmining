HUSBAND It's just outside on the other side of this wall here. 
MRS. ROSE I'm going to head up. Can I get you something to drink? Coffee... tea? 
The KID gives himself an ever-so-tiny smile. SALES STUDENT ALEX Tea would be great. 
The man walks over to a back basement door and opens it. He ushers the SALES KID through. 
HUSBAND Please. 
I/E. DOORWAY OZONE PARK BASEMENT - DAY 
As the SALES KID goes through the door a massive fist of SOMEONE who has been waiting on the other side of the door comes swinging into frame and pounds the side of our KID'S head. Knocking him out instantly. 
INT. TRUCK CAB, 59TH STREET BRIDGE RAMP - DAY 
JULIAN is close to getting off the bridge and is starting to feel better. Just as the traffic in front of him starts to clear up, out of the corner of his eye he sees something. In his side-view mirror he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO getting out of a random car behind him. His heart starts racing. He looks over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up. Again. 
JULIAN thinks for a second then reaches for the CB RADIO. 
JULIAN Cathy! They are coming again. Over. Help. Help. On Bridge. 
He then fumbles the CB and it drops to the floor of the cab. He looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are still coming for him. 
The camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a long second, and he then makes his decision. He reaches under his seat and takes out a handgun. He doesn't really seem to know what he is doing with it. 
But he opens the door of the truck and gets out. He aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO walking towards him. LOUIS SERVIDIO sees him and is very surprised and stops. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there. 
He glances over at THUG #2. JULIAN Get the fuck away from me! 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Okay, man. 
People in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk. Then LOUIS SERVIDIO gives a nod signal to THUG #2 who is on the other side of the truck, and JULIAN'S gun fires by mistake. It totally misses THUG #2. He jumps out of the way and is hiding behind the wheel. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Watch it now, man. You're going to hurt someone. 
JULIAN is now in a total state of panic. He is hiding back in front of the truck. The three men are basically doing a slow- motion, very stressful hide-and-seek around the truck. The two THUGS now have their guns out. 
The honking has now reached a total insane level as traffic is backing up. Then THUG #2 makes one last play to take the truck. He tries to climb into the cab and JULIAN goes into a rage. He quickly fires three shots, missing THUG #2 with each one, but that forces LOUIS SERVIDIO to shoot two shots of his own at JULIAN to protect THUG #2. They miss as well, but one hits the main section of the tank and a small but steady stream of heating oil starts pouring out onto the roadway. 
Just then we hear sirens starting to come closer in the background. This adds a new element. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Where are you? 
THUG #2 Over here. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Where is he? 
THUG #2 Over here. 
JULIAN is just trying to decide what to do next. The sirens are now getting much closer. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Get the car! THUG #2 takes off. This now leaves JULIAN and LOUIS SERVIDIO all alone with the police coming. As JULIAN is hiding, trying to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by him. As he does: 
LOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Run for it! JULIAN thinks for a second and then runs. 
EXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DAY 
JULIAN runs all along the bridge and then sees LOUIS SERVIDIO run through a small door into the body of one of the four massive stone anchor structures that hold up the bridge. 
INT. THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE, SUPPORT COLUMN - DAY 
Once he is inside, there's another set of stairs. He locks the door behind him and starts racing down the stairs. As he heads down he hears someone just in front of him. He stops and looks down the center column of the stairs and looking up at him about three flights away is LOUIS SERVIDIO. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Oh, there he is. Had to be the hero eh? 
JULIAN Fuck you. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Couldn't just let us take the truck. 
JULIAN Fuck you! 
JULIAN is screaming in a fit of panic at this point. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Hey man relax... calm down. Did they see you come in here? 
JULIAN can't stop breathing very heavy at this point. 
JULIAN I don't think so.

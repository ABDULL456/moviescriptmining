ANGLE ON THE SPHERE -- some dark red MARKINGS on it's surface... 
TED (continuing) Looks like a design, some writing, maybe.  Maybe it was sent to meet the spacecraft with a message. 
HARRY Look closely.  That isn't writing. Those are grooves. 
ON THE RED GROOVES -- engraved into the surface. 
HARRY No.  They don't represent a message. They aren't decorative at all.  They have another purpose entirely. 
BARNES What? 
HARRY To conceal a small break in the surface of the sphere. 
BARNES A break for what? 
INT.  HABITAT -- HALLWAY 
DOWN A LONG CORRIDOR -- WE SEE Barnes, through a half-closed door, pacing, talking on the phone... 
BARNES ... it's definitely something alien ... another civilization, yes, sir... Well, we don't know yet, but we think we've found a door... 
INT.  VIDEO FEED ROOM 
Edmunds, Barnes, and the team members (minus Ted) look at the monitor. 
BARNES So how do we get it open? 
HARRY Ted seems to have some ideas. 
ON THE MONITOR -- Ted pushing on the SPHERE door.  Banging into it with his shoulder. 
NORMAN Maybe we shouldn't. 
BARNES What? 
NORMAN If it is alien, maybe we shouldn't try to open it at all. 
HARRY (nodding to Norman) Man is man, all he knows is man, and all he can think of is what he knows.  The anthropomorphic problem. Good, Norman. 
BARNES The what? 
NORMAN I mentioned it in my report.  Didn't you read the report? 
HARRY Everything ever written about extra- terrestial life imagines that life is essentially human.  If it doesn't look human, it's a reptile or a big insect or something, having human values, human understanding. 
BARNES So?  What's the problem? 
HARRY It's nonsense.  There's enough difference between our own species to prove that. 
BETH Take politics, our views on abortion, the death penalty... 
HARRY Cannibalism, to be extreme.  And now we're talking about a new life form. Their values and ethics may be incomprehensible. 
BARNES Like "Thou shall not kill"? 
NORMAN Or maybe, it can't be killed. 
BARNES You mean, what's in that thing is immortal? 
NORMAN I don't know.  That's the point. 
BARNES Everything can be killed. 
BETH Not everything.  Even on earth.  Take ... yeasts. 
BARNES Yeasts?  Thank you, Beth, but I don't think we're gonna open it up and find a loaf of bread. 
HARRY And we're just talking about three- dimensional creatures.  What if it's five or six or seven-dimensional?  So dimensional that we couldn't even see it to kill it. 
NORMAN Good point.  I don't know what you're talking about, but good point. 
BARNES Or it could contain some great benefit to us, some astonishing new idea or technology to help mankind. 
HARRY It could.  But the odds of it being any use to us are against it. 
BARNES You don't know that. 
HARRY Let's say whoever made this thing is a thousand years ahead of us, just like we are to, say, medieval Europe.  Suppose you went back to medieval Europe with a TV set.  There wouldn't be any place to plug it in. 
BARNES Just tell me worst case.  Worst case of what we might find? 
BETH It could breathe in air and exhale cyanide gas. 
NORMAN Disrupt our brain waves, interfere with our ability to think. 
HARRY Produce radioactive waste and disintegrate us into nothing. 
CUT TO: 
CLOSE ON PRINTER, TYPING: "Surface winds at 25 knots -- Estimated Time of Departure -- 01:45 hrs" 
CUT TO: 
INT.  DH-8 HALLWAY 
Empty, sterile.  WE HEAR the repeating sound: THWAP.  Almost like a dripping faucet.  THWAP... THWAP... 
INT.  LIVING QUARTERS 
Harry on his bunk, staring at the wall, flicking his middle finger at his cheek: THWAP... THWAP. 
HARRY You realize, Norman, that we are all going to die. 
Norman is lying in his own bunk, below Harry. 
NORMAN Don't be so optomistic, Harry. 
HARRY I'm completely serious.  There is something very important missing from that spacecraft.  You know what that is? 
NORMAN Not a clue. 
HARRY A sign that the builders knew time travel through a black hole was possible. 
NORMAN I don't follow you. 
HARRY On that flight recorder, they called the black hole an "Unknown Entry Event." They didn't know what a black hole was.  Fifty years from now, men are going to build that ship in a very tentative, experimental way, with no knowledge that time travel through a black hole is possible. 
NORMAN So what? 
Harry leans his head over his bunk. 
HARRY So, we know. (beat) We know it went through a black hole.  We saw it.  Norman -- when we'd get to the surface, we'd tell someone about the black hole, wouldn't we?  It'd go in some report like some big discovery.  So in fifty years when they build that ship, they'd make precautions for a black hole. (beat) But they didn't.  The called it an Unknown Entry Event.

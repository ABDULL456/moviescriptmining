{"train": "THE BACHELOR PARTY \nby Paddy Chayefsky \nFADE IN. \nEXTERIOR. STUYVESANT TOWN HOUSING PROJECT -- DAY. Under the credits, the CAMERA PANS slowly across the project, capturing the sober monotony, the endless straight apartment houses. Seven o'clock in the morning. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM The bedroom of a two-and-a-half-room apartment in the housing project. It is early morning, but the shades are drawn and the room is dark. CAMERA moves slowly across the room, over the large double bed on which Charlie and Helen Samson, a young couple in their late twenties, are sleeping. They are sleeping more or less on their sides, facing away from each other. One of Helen's pajama-clad legs projects from under the light covers. We close in on Charlie's sleeping face. \nThe alarm clock at a distant end of the room suddenly bursts into a soft relentless buzz. Charlie's eyes open. There is a muffled movement at his side, and Helen gets up on one elbow. Then she sits up, rises, and pads barefooted -- a rather pretty girl in rumpled pajamas -- to the alarm clock and turns it off. Charlie's head turns on the pillow so that he can watch her. She pads back to the bed now and stands at the foot, looking down at her husband. She produces a smile, then turns and shuffles into the bathroom where she turns on the wall switch. A shaft of light now pours into the bedroom. \nCharlie sits up in bed. His shoes and socks are on the floor by his feet. He reaches down and starts to put them on. Suddenly, from the recesses of the bathroom, Helen's rather vague soprano lifts into the first lines of a popular song. Then it stops as abruptly as it began. Charlie's head slowly turns to look at the bathroom, back again to the business of putting on his socks. His face is expressionless, but there is no mistaking the sodden distaste he has for the world today. \nHe just sits on the bed, a young man of twenty-nine, clad only in his pajama trousers, one sock dangling from his hand, his head hanging, his shoulders slumped. Behind him, the sudden noise of rushing tap water, then off. Then his wife comes back into the bedroom. She is carrying a bath towel with which she is drying her face. Finished, she drops the towel on the bed and begins to dress. A moment later, she pads around the corner of the bed to Charlie's front. She is still barefooted and wears her pajama top, but she has exchanged the trousers for a half-slip. Charlie hasn't moved a muscle since the effort required to lift one sock from the floor. \nHELEN You think it's too early to call my mother? \nCHARLIE I don't know. \nCharlie shrugs without looking up. Helen goes out of the bedroom, into the little square of foyer where there is a telephone table with a telephone on it. She dials, waits. In the bedroom, Charlie rubs his eyes with two fingers. \nHELEN (on phone) Hello, Ma, did I wake you up? This is Helen.... Well, I'll be going to work, and I wanted to get ahold of you before I left. I called you last night. Where were you and Pop anyway? I kept calling you every half hour up till one o'clock.... Oh, yeah? Did you have a nice time? ... \nCAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN FOR CLOSEUP of Charlie in bedroom. \nHELEN'S VOICE Well, listen, Ma, I got something to tell you. I'm pregnant.... Yeah, pregnant.... Of course I'm sure. I've got the report back from the laboratory.... No, you wouldn't know him, Doctor Axelrod.... Second month. He says I can expect the baby in February.... Well, Grandma, act a little excited, will you? ... You bet I'm excited.... \nCLOSEUP OF CHARLIE He is not excited. If anything he is miserable. His bowed head rises slowly. The eyes open. He stares abstractedly ahead for a moment. Then he sighs a profound sigh of resignation. Then his eyes close again, and his head slowly sinks back to its previous abjection. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. THE KITCHEN -- HALF HOUR LATER Helen, dressed in skirt and blouse now, is preparing two cups of instant coffee, pouring hot water from the saucepan into the two cups. The toaster is ticking. A packaged loaf of white bread is open on the cupboard shelf. Finished with pouring the water, Helen sets the saucepan back on the stove and comes out into the dining area. The dinette table is covered from end to end by open textbooks, several very large accounting worksheets on which are scrawled meticulous numbers, a ruler, several pencils and a pen, an ash tray glutted with cigarettes, a cup and saucer. \nHELEN (calling to the bedroom) Do you need any of this or can I take them off the table? \nCharlie appears in the bedroom doorway, dressed and washed now, a neat, clean young man in a white shirt and neatly knotted tie. \nCHARLIE I'll clean that up in a minute. \nHe disappears back into the bedroom. Helen picks up the ash tray and the cup and saucer. \nHELEN How late were you up last night? \nCHARLIE'S VOICE About two. \nINTERIOR. THE BEDROOM Charlie standing by the window, is picking up his keys, a few dollar bills, a comb, etc., from a chair and putting them into his trouser pockets. The blinds of the bedroom window have been opened, and the high August sun streams in, whitening Charlie's face. After he has pocketed his odds and ends, he moves to the chest of drawers on which, among all sorts of other things, there are several textbooks and an opened notebook. He stands a moment looking down into the open notebook, his lips moving ever so little, as he commits some of his notes to memory. He turns a page of the notebook back to check something and then goes back to the previous page. Now he opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest of drawers. The drawer contains wisps of his wife's stockings and other feminine things. He finds a small roll of bills and takes one of them, putting the bill in his pocket and closing the dresser drawer. \nCHARLIE I'm taking five bucks from your drawer. \nHe pauses now to affix a less frowning expression onto his face and goes out into the little foyer and into the dining area. \nCHARLIE I better get going. Kenny's probably waiting for me now. I'm sorry I yelled like that. \nHELEN What are you sorry about? Don't I yell at you all the time? \nWE STAY ON HELEN, as she reads her newspaper, but there is a faint frown on her face. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. LOCAL PLATFORM EASTSIDE IRT SUBWAY An express train hurtles southward. We see it flashing by through the concrete pillars of the subway. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nIRT EXPRESS HURTLING SOUTHWARD Charlie and another young man, named Kenneth, are seated in a crowded subway car. People are standing tightly in the aisles. Kenneth is an amiable young man of thirty-odd. He has his jacket off and his tie loosened as a concession to the August heat. Charlie is neatly and coolly dressed. He has two notebooks and a battered text in his lap. He is reading the text. Two young white-collar workers on their way to work. They ride along silently for a moment. Kenneth is rather stealthily concerned with a full-busted young woman who is standing directly in front of him, holding on to a strap. It is summertime, and the girls all wear light summer frocks. There is a feeling of wistful sensuality to the scene. \nKENNETH You going to Arnold's bachelor party? \nCHARLIE I don't think so, Kennie. \nKENNETH What? \nCHARLIE I got two classes tonight. \nKENNETH Yeah, I was going to go, but I think I better not, because my kid, the young one, the girl, she's been acting up again lately. She's got some kind of allergy, the doctors don't know what. \nCHARLIE These bachelor parties get kind of wild sometimes. Eddie Watkins is making all the arrangements. He's probably got us lined up with a bunch of chorus girls. \nKENNETH Yeah, do you think so? \nCHARLIE You know Eddie. \nKENNETH Yeah, boy, he really lives it up, don't he? Did you see that blonde who picked him up for lunch last week? Boy, sometimes I wish I was a bachelor. Well, you know what I mean. I never seem to get out of the house any more, you know what I mean? About once a week, I go to the movies. We never even see the whole picture. My wife starts worrying about the kids. My youngest kid, the girl, she's got some kind of rash. We don't know what it is. I never seem to see anybody any more. Do you know how long it is since I've seen Willie Duff? I haven't seen Willie in about six months. My wife can't stand his wife. You ever seen her, Willie's wife? \nCHARLIE No, I didn't know Willie too well. \nKENNETH Boy, wait'll you have kids, boy. You'll never get out of the house. \nCHARLIE Helen's pregnant now. \nKENNETH No kidding. \nCHARLIE Yeah. \nKENNETH Oh, that's wonderful, Charlie, that's wonderful! \nThe two young husbands look down again at their hands and ride along silently. Kenneth sneaks a quick look up at the girl standing in front of him, and then lets his attention drift down the length of the car. \nKENNETH Hey, there's a guy down there, trying to pick up a girl down there. \nHe is referring to a Young Fellow who elbowed his way down through the crowded aisle but who stopped abruptly when he noticed an attractive girl, seated about three seats down from Kenneth. The Girl is reading a newspaper. The Young Fellow stares at her. The Girl, aware of this sudden attention, looks briefly up from her newspaper. The Young Fellow smiles pleasantly. The Girl, with a show of annoyance, looks back to her newspaper. \nKENNETH Were you with us about eight years ago when I picked up that chick in front of the bus stop in Paterson, New Jersey? \nCHARLIE When was this? \nThey start to crowd down the aisle. The train is chugging into the Chambers Street station, and we can see the yellowed lights of the platform and the quick blur of faces. The two young husbands, who had been following the byplay between The Girl and the Young Fellow, now watch them slowly exit. There is an expression of poignant wistfulness on both their faces. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXTERIOR. THE OFFICE We look down on the bookkeeping department of a life insurance company in downtown Manhattan area around Pine Street. It is a fairly large room, large enough to hold eleven desks. But you get the feeling that this is one of the smaller offices on the floor. You get the feeling that this company occupies three or four floors of this building. Despite the size of the office, it has a cluttered look. Each desk has piles of paper on it, and all the impedimenta of the bookkeeper -- the pens and pencils, the adding machine, the telephone. Some of the desks have typewriters. Along the walls there are rows of filing cabinets and wall bins stocked with large worksheets and thick ledgers. At the far end of the room, there is a row of windows, but it is still necessary to keep the overhead fluorescent lights on all day. They are on now. There are two middle-aged women standing, murmuring to each other, and a rather heavy-set balding man in his late forties, sitting at a desk in his shirt sleeves, already hard at work, although it is still ten minutes shy of eight-thirty. \nKenneth and Charlie enter. Ad lib hellos between them and the two middle-aged women. Charlie moves to the coat rack to hang up his jacket, drops off his books on his desk, starts for the coat rack. Behind Charlie, we see Kenneth, carrying his jacket, moving to his desk, up where the middle-aged man is working. \nKENNETH Hiya, Walter. \nCHARLIE Hiya, Walter. \nWalter, the middle-aged man, nods his good mornings. \nKENNETH (poking in his desk drawer; amiably) Walter, what time do you come in in the mornings? You're making us all look lousy, you know that? I get the feeling sometimes, you stay here overnight. \nWalter merely nods, doesn't bother to look up from the work. Kenneth finds a stick of gum in his drawer, unwraps it. Two more women, gray-haired and bespectacled, come into the office. There is an ad lib mumble of hellos in background. Charlie hangs up his jacket on the coat rack. \nCHARLIE Arnold in yet? \nWALTER He starts his vacation today. He's getting married Sunday, you know. \nCLOSEUP of Charlie looking out the window into the bright August morning. His face is just a little ruffled by a frown, and there is a kind of pain in his eyes. Behind him, Walter and Kenneth. \nWALTER (a nervous, anxious man) Well, the doctor was over last night. Brought over the X rays; brought over the allergy tests. Brought over a bill for sixty-eight dollars.  I said to him: \"Doctor, you're a young man, professional, highly educated, four years of college, two years of premedical training, several years of interning, of residency. If you're so smart, how can you charge me sixty-eight dollars? One thing they apparently didn't teach you in medical school. You can't get blood from a stone.\" \nKENNETH So what's wrong with you, Walter? \nWALTER What's wrong? I have to go to Arizona, that's what's wrong. I have asthma. When I was a kid, they called it hay fever, and you carried a bag around your neck. Asafetida. Now, they call it asthma, and you have to go to Arizona. I said to him: \"Doctor, you're a professional man, four years of college, premedical school, Bellevue, several diplomas. Answer me a question. Who's going to pay for Arizona?\" I said to him: \"Doctor,\" I said, \"perhaps you have the illusion I am the Aga Khan. I have a bearing about me, perhaps, that misleads you to believe I have blood ties with the Whitneys and the Rockefellers. This isn't true.\" Arizona. Did you ever hear of such nonsense? \nKENNETH How serious is it, Walter? \nWALTER Serious. Nothing serious. I have hay fever, I sneeze a couple of times. The idiot told my wife I have to go to Arizona, and she wouldn't leave me alone all night. She's already packing the bags. I said: \"For heaven's sakes, you listen to doctors, we'll all be dead.\" My son, Harold, believe me, he's going to be a doctor. That's some racket, boy. Sixty-eight dollars. \nCLOSEUP of Charlie, still at the window, when a bell suddenly clangs, indicating the start of the workday. The sudden jangle makes him start, and he closes his eyes briefly against the noise.  Walter, in background, who had risen and was bent over Kenneth's desk, darts nervously back to his own desk. \nWALTER You better get to work. Hey, Charlie, that was the bell. I think Flaherty is here this morning. We'll all be fired today. I have a feeling. \nHe hunches over his ledgers again, his anxious, harried face drawn into intense wrinkles of concentration. Several other women have come into the office by now, and there is a general movement to the desks. There is the click of a typewriter, and Walter runs his fingers glibly over the adding machine on his desk. The day has started. \nAfter a moment, Charlie turns from the window and comes back to his desk, sinks down onto his chair. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. THE OFFICE -- TWENTY MINUTES LATER We look down on the bookkeeping department. All the desks are occupied but two. There are six women and our three men. The office is silent with industry, everybody's head bent over his desk. There is the occasional punctuation of an adding machine or a typewriter or a phone ringing. \nOur three men are bent over their tally sheets, worksheets, and ledgers, occasionally reaching up to quickly tabulate something on the adding machine. After a moment, Walter says: \nWALTER (without looking up from his work) You fellows going to Arnold's party tonight? \nKENNETH (without looking up) No, I'm not going, are you? \nWALTER No. Eddie already hooked me for four bucks for Arnold's present. This dinner is going to cost another couple of good dollars. \nEDDIE Mary, give me an outside line.... (he pauses, checks the number in the phone book again, dials, waits) Hello, is this Leathercraft on Madison Avenue? ... This is Mr. Watkins. I was in about a week ago. I ordered a military set and a wallet. They were supposed to be ready yesterday.... Yes, please, would you? ... (he is searching his pockets while he waits, finds a piece of paper, pulls it out) Yeah, a military set and a wallet.... \nWALTER Is that what we bought poor Arnold? \nEDDIE (on phone) That's right. The following inscriptions should be on them: (reads from the paper) On the military set: \"To Arnold: Best wishes on your marriage from Alice, Charlie, Eddie, Evelyn, Jeanette with two t's, Kenneth, Lucy, Mary, Olga, Walter, and Flaherty.\" Now on the wallet ... Yeah, what? .... Yeah, that's right -- Flaherty. Now, on the wallet, the following inscription: \"To my Best Friend Arnold from his Best Man Eddie.\" ... No, to my best friend Arnold. ... That's right. \"From his best man Eddie\" ... Now, can I come in at lunch and pick them up? ... \nA young woman comes into the office, goes to Walter's desk and drops some papers before him. \nWALTER What's this, Jeanette? \nGIRL It's from finance, don't ask me. \nThis is the girl in the office who goes to the water cooler three times a morning and all the men covertly watch her. She is cute, but attractive more by comparison to the other women in the office. Nevertheless, all the men, including Eddie and Charlie, let their eyes cautiously watch her as she leaves, her sheath dress tight on her hips. \nEddie, who has hung up, now rubs his eyes with two fingers to clear his head and picks up the phone again. \nEDDIE (on phone) Mary, give me the Hotel Westmore. Circle 7-0598. \nCHARLIE (hands Kennie paper) This isn't for me -- it's for you. \nEDDIE (to the others) Now who owes me on the presents? Charlie, you owe me? \nCHARLIE I gave you four bucks yesterday.... \nKENNETH I owe you, Eddie. I'll pay you tomorrow, payday. \nEDDIE (on phone) Miss Frances Kelley, please. I think it's room 417.... \nThe three heads around him look slowly up from their respective work, naked interest manifest on their faces. \nEDDIE (calling to one of the women in the office) Hey, Evelyn, you owe me four bucks. \nEVELYN (calling back) All right. I know. \nEDDIE (on phone) Hello, Frances, this is Eddie.... All right, wait a minute. Give me a chance to explain.... I know I woke you up.... All right, let me tell you. You know I'm supposed to be the best man at this fellow Arnold's wedding. So I called him up last night because I didn't know whether I was supposed to wear tuxedo or tails. Well, he didn't know either, so he said: \"Come on over to my girl's house with me tonight. They're making all the arrangements for the wedding now.\" So I called you and left a message at the desk saying I couldn't get over till about ten o'clock.... All right! That's what I'm going to explain! ... Thank you. (holds receiver against his chest and looks at his colleagues with air of a man being tried just a little too much. Returns receiver to his ear, listens for a moment) All right, so I had to go over to Arnold's girl's house with Arnold last night. Well, there was about thirty people there, and, man, you never saw such a crazy mess. There was this little bald-headed guy there. He's the bride's uncle. He's come all the way down from Boston with his whole family to go to the wedding. The only trouble was, he wasn't invited. Well, this crazy uncle, he grabs ahold of me, he starts shaking me by the lapels. So I said: \"What do you want from me? I ain't the groom! I'm just trying to find out whether I'm supposed to wear tuxedo or tails.\" (apparently this got a laugh. Eddie breaks into a smile) Funny, huh? ... Look, Frances. I have to go to work now. I'm calling you from the office. How about letting me make this up to you? I'll take you out to dinner Saturday night.... I can't make it tonight. The bachelor party's tonight.... All right, Saturday night.... It's a date.... S'help me.... I swear, right on time. Eight-thirty, okay? ... Okay, we'll have a ball. Goodbye, go back to sleep. \nHe hangs up. The three married men look down again to their ledgers and tap away again on their adding machines. Eddie sits slumped in his seat for a moment. \nEDDIE What did I just tell that girl, Saturday night? \nKENNETH Yeah. \nEDDIE (picks up phone) Mary, give me Columbus 5-1098.... What do you mean personal calls! These are business calls! Well, stop listening to other people's conversations.... What have you got, stock in the company? Columbus (waits) \nKENNETH Listen, Eddie, I don't think I can go tonight. My father-in-law's in from Akron, Ohio, and---- \nEDDIE (all sweetness) Hello, who is this, Mrs. Stebbins? ... This is Eddie, Mrs. Stebbins. I wonder if I can talk to Muriel.... Could I speak to her? ... Thank you.... \nThe three married men each look up slowly again, naked envy on each face. \nEDDIE (on phone) Muriel, baby, listen, sweetie, I can't make it Saturday night.... I'm all loused up with this wedding I'm supposed to be the best man at.... We have to rehearse the ceremony. You'd think they were getting married on television.... Yes, sweetie, why don't I call you Monday. Maybe, we'll work out something before you go back to California.... All right, sweetie, good-bye. \nHe hangs up, sits a moment, then finally removes the cigarette from his mouth, crushes it in his ash tray, and turns to the others. \nWIDE SHOT of our bachelor party, showing all five. They all seem to be in the best of spirits. The new member of the cast is Arnold, the groom, a towheaded, pleasant-looking young man of thirty, shy to the point of being noticeable. Of all the men at the party, he is the quietest. He sits, a smile nailed onto his face, turning his head from one friend to another as they talk, enjoying the rare privilege of being liked. The dinner is over. During the ensuing scene, a bus boy continues to remove the used dishes. Several large bottles of beer and two fifths of Scotch are on the table. There is a welter of variously assorted glasses. Eddie, Walter, and Kenneth are smoking cigars, Charlie a cigarette. The Groom is not smoking.  We have cut into the scene during a jumble of conversation. Walter is talking to Charlie, whose head is bent toward the older man. Kenneth is trying to tell the Groom a joke, but the Groom's attention is being distracted by Eddie, who is leaning across the table trying to get Charlie's attention. Ad libs. \nKENNETH (finishing story) Three hundred pounds! Isn't she kind of fat? No, man, tall! Hey, waiter! Waiter! \nEDDIE Hey, Charlie ... \nWALTER (to Charlie) ... so we were stationed right outside Paris, about eight miles, a town called Chatou ... \nEDDIE ... hey, Charlie ... \nWALTER (to Charlie) ... so the first night, a whole bunch of us swiped a jeep out of the motor court. We had a feller there who was a tech sergeant in the motor court. Oh, what a character he was! He used to get loaded every night on that vanilla extract. \nEDDIE Hey, Charlie ... \nCHARLIE What do you want, Eddie? \nEDDIE Hey, Charlie, did I ever tell you about the time I was stationed at Buckley Field in Denver, and I picked up this girl in Lakeside Amusement Park? \nWALTER Hey, Eddie, listen to this story I'm telling Charlie. Hey, Arnold, I'm telling Charlie about the time me and that crazy tech sergeant from the motor court got loaded on vanilla extract and went to Paris ... Hey, Kenneth ... \nKENNETH When do the Giants come back from their road trip, does anybody know? \nEDDIE Hey, let's give out the presents now. \nWALTER Hey, Kenneth, listen to this story. I was stationed outside of Paris, about eight miles ... \nCHARLIE What? \nKENNETH Oh, that Paris! I was there for two days! Clubs! You had to beat the women off with clubs! ... \nCHARLIE (to people at another table) What ...? Oh, it's a bachelor party -- this guy's getting married. \nEDDIE Listen, I want to give the presents ... \nWALTER Well, let me tell you what happened ... \nEDDIE Hey, you know what was a great town for women, Hamburg! \nKENNETH Hamburg! Clubs! Clubs! You had to beat them off with clubs! Hey, waiter -- who's our waiter? \nCHARLIE Hey, Arnold, enjoying yourself? \nEDDIE The first night I was in Hamburg, two Frauleins come walking right in the barracks. So I said to the lieutenant ... \nWalter, who is pretty lit, suddenly stands and bangs the table mightily with his fist. \nWALTER (bellowing out) The best fighting outfit in the whole fighting army was the fighting Hundred and Fourth Infantry Division, General Terry Allen commanding! \nThis brings the jumbled conversation to a halt. Walter surveys the other four, looking for possible challenges, then sits heavily down. \nEDDIE (standing) Well, now that we got that settled.... \nCHARLIE I'm with you, Walter. \nThis touching address has brought a note of sadness to the gathering. Indeed, there are tears in Walter's and Arnold's eyes. \nEDDIE (handing Arnold two neatly wrapped packages) Well, anyway, in all seriousness, here are a couple of presents from all of us in the office and good luck. \nArnold takes the presents, stands, head bowed. Eddie sits and all faces turn to Arnold. \nARNOLD Well, I just want to thank you fellows. I don't know what to say. I just want to thank you. \nKENNETH Open the presents, Arnold. \nARNOLD I will. I just want to say, Eddie, that when the Pirates invade Ebbets Field next Tuesday night, I'm going to be sitting right there in Section 37 there right with you. \nEDDIE You'll be on your honeymoon next Tuesday, Arnold. \nThis interesting information gives Arnold pause. \nARNOLD Gee, that's right. \nCHARLIE (smiling) Arnold, you're getting married Sunday, did you forget? \nWALTER Look at him blush. \nARNOLD (frowning fuzzily) No, I didn't forget. It's just that ... Gee, that's right. Sunday. What's today, Thursday? \nKENNETH and EDDIE All day! \nARNOLD Boy, it's here, isn't it? I guess I've been running around so much the last couple of weeks, I guess the wedding snuck up on me. \nKENNETH I think Arnold's having a little buck fever. Does anyone know what our waiter looks like? \nEDDIE (to Kenneth) You know who didn't want to chip in for Arnold's presents? ... \nCHARLIE Arnold'll be all right. Have a drink, Arnold. \nWALTER I had my basic training in Camp Croft, South Carolina, near Spartanburg. \nEDDIE I was at Maxwell Field, what a desert. \nCHARLIE Walter, what ever happened when you and that tech sergeant from the motor pool got loaded on vanilla extract? \nWALTER What tech sergeant? \nCHARLIE Walter, you're crocked. (to Arnold) Open up the presents -- see what you got. \nKENNETH Hey, are you our waiter? Bring us some ice. I got him -- I got our waiter! \nARNOLD It was sure nice of you fellows. \nThe voices have risen again into the jumbled high spirits that opened the scene. \nEDDIE Hey, man, we're having a ball! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCHARLIE (to The Existentialist) We're from Terre Haute, and we've come to the big city looking for a good time, and we just don't know what to do with ourselves, ma'am. \nEDDIE (to Walter) Look at that Charlie operate. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST Must be a convention in town. \nCHARLIE We've just come off the ranch there, honey, and we're just raring. Is that right, men? Are we raring? \nEDDIE We're raring, boy, we're raring! \nKENNETH (beside himself with laughter) Hey, Charlie, cut it out, will you? \nThe lights change and The Existentialist starts off across Greenwich Avenue to the west side of the street. The five carousers follow right along after her.  That is, Charlie dogs along behind The Existentialist as they cross the street. Walter and Eddie are close behind him, listening to Charlie's pitch. Kenneth and Arnold, embarrassed and giggling, stagger along behind. \nCHARLIE (chugging along behind The Existentialist) We're down here in Greenwich Village looking for some wild bohemians. Do you happen to know any wild bohemians? \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST All right, fellows, enough's enough, huh? \nShe steps up to the sidewalk on the west side of Greenwich Avenue and hurries along down Tenth Street to a little house about four doors down, the five carousers on her heels like a pack of puppies. \nCHARLIE (hurrying along after The Existentialist) I'm something of a poet myself, ma'am. Many's the long night in the bunkhouse where I sat by myself and wrote by the flickering light of a kerosene lamp. Could I read you some of my poems, ma'am? I know they ain't much, but they're from the heart, ma'am. \nThe Existentialist pauses in her hurried walk down Tenth Street to examine Charlie with some interest. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST You have a sense of humor, don't you? \nEDDIE (to Charlie) You're going great, man, don't stop now. \nThe Existentialist goes up the two little steps to the front door of the house and rings the bell. \nEDDIE (to The Existentialist) Where are you going, honey? \nThe Existentialist waits composed and patient for someone to answer her ring. Charlie has wandered back to Arnold and Kenneth, and the three of them are now suffused with laughter. Kenneth has been laughing so much, tears are coming out of his eyes. He walks around in little circles clutching his sides. Several passersby hurry by, noting the strange little group on the sidewalk. \nEDDIE (to The Existentialist) What's going on in there, honey? \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST (patiently bored) There's a party going on. I'm not sure I'm invited myself, so I can't really invite you. \nEDDIE Sure you can. \nThe door opens and a woman in a tea gown stands there looking at The Existentialist and then at the five men on the sidewalk. Behind her, there is evidence of a party going on. \nTHE HOSTESS How nice to see you, darling. Who are your friends? \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST I haven't the vaguest idea. I was ambushed crossing Greenwich Avenue by a tribe of the Terre Haute Kiwanis. \nTHE HOSTESS (she waves a vague hand in a sort of shooing motion at the five men on the sidewalk) Go away, you men. Go back to the Biltmore Hotel and put on your red caps. \nEDDIE I always thought you city people were more hospitable to us poor farm boys. \nThe other four carousers are laughing too much to even talk. Charlie has ambled up to The Existentialist, who is peering over her hostess into the room behind her. \nCHARLIE (to The Existentialist, smiling amiably) I'm sorry, miss. A friend of ours is getting married here, and we're just horsing around. \nARNOLD Sure. (turns to the others in living room, plants a huge smile on his face) Well, I'm getting married Sunday. \nKENNETH Having fun, Walter? \nWALTER Fun. A bunch of grown men sitting around waiting to look at college boy pictures. \nARNOLD I swear, I never thought two months ago I was ever going to get married. I still don't know how it happened.... \nEDDIE Hey, somebody turn off the lights. \nWalter is promptly up to turn off the lights. \nCHARLIE Hey, you know, you've got a nice place here. \nThe room is abruptly flooded in darkness. A beam of light shoots out from the projector. It seems pointed at the window. Arnold stands up directly in the shaft of light. \nARNOLD I was just taking her out. I didn't know it was so serious. \nEDDIE Arnold, get out of the way, will you? \nARNOLD Oh, sure. \nArnold moves a step, still in the shaft of light, his shadow huge on the wall. Eddie, muttering, jockeys the projector around trying to focus it on the screen. The square of light and some flickering images wander up and down a wall. \nARNOLD ... We're sitting in the car, so she says: \"Well, Arnold, we've been going together six months now. I think it's time we decided whether we were being serious.\" \nWALTER Hey, Eddie, you got it on the window. \nARNOLD I didn't know it was so serious. I didn't even know we were going together. I just took her out every now and then. \nCHARLIE Arnold, you're funny. \nEDDIE Turn on the lights again, will you, Walter. \nWALTER What's the matter? \nEDDIE I forgot to loop it over this loop thing. \nWalter crosses to light switch. The room is flooded in light again. \nCHARLIE Oh, for crying out loud. \nARNOLD (small panic) I can't even remember what she looks like! I just saw her this afternoon! \nKENNETH Arnold, have a bottle of beer. It's not so terrible. \nARNOLD Boy, I tell you. It's for the rest of your life when you get married. This is a big decision to make. \nWALTER Does anybody seriously want to see these movies? \nEddie is furiously winding and unwinding spools. CAMERA HAS DOLLIED AROUND so that we are looking back up the living room toward the projector and the men. \nARNOLD I could be making a serious mistake. \nWALTER (after a moment) Life is short. \nThis gives everybody something to think about for a moment. \nEDDIE (hunched over the projector, dismantling it) You guys feel like going down to have a drink for Arnold? \nThis brings a reaction. Walter stands. \nWALTER Yeah! What do you say? One last drink for Arnold! \nCHARLIE Okay with me. \nSuddenly life is back in the room, the men ad-lib: \"Where's my coat?\" \"Let's get out of here,\" etc. \nKENNETH (unwinding himself from his slouched position on a chair) You can say what you want to about these pictures -- they're really pretty bad -- but they get you. \nARNOLD Don't you think we ought to clean up the place? \nEDDIE No, I got a woman comes in. \nWALTER (grabbing up his jacket) I almost fell asleep during the last one. (he looks at the others) Well, what do you say, huh? Let's go! One last drink! \nAd libs on exit. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. LIVING ROOM CHARLIE AND HELEN'S APARTMENT Helen and Julie. A corner lamp in the living room is lit, lending a soft but not too effective light to the room. The two young women are on the couch. Helen sits curled at one end, head down listening to Julie, who has been talking and probably crying a little since we last saw them forty-five minutes ago. Julie is seated with her legs stretched out in front of her, her head resting back on the back of the couch. She is talking more freely and easily now, the first hard outburst over with. \nJULIE ... He's a boy, my Mike. Till the day he dies, he'll never be more than fifteen. Perpetual adolescence, that's the curse of the professional man. He spends his whole youth trying to be a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant. Then he spends the rest of his life looking for the fun he should have had when he was a boy. \nHELEN Oh, I know. Charlie and I hardly even see each other. \nJULIE It's very hard on the wife, Helen. These are the years when you should be building your marriage. Instead, you grow away from each other. I've seen it happen with my friends. In the end, they have nice homes in New Rochelle, and a maid, and their maids are happier than they are. But sometimes it does work. It can be done, Helen. Encourage Charlie to stay with his school because... \nHELEN Oh, I will, Julie ... \nJULIE ... he's an ambitious boy ... \nHELEN ... oh, it's not just he's ambitious ... \nJULIE ... and if he doesn't fulfill himself, he'll resent you and your baby the rest of his life. \nHELEN Oh, I don't want him to quit. He loves accounting, Julie. I see him sometimes, sitting over his homework. He's got his ledgers out, and he's adding up columns of figures as long as his arm. And he's chuckling. You'd think he was reading the comics. He has a book there, Business Law. How he can read it I don't know. But I'll be watching television or something, and he'll come over, and he'll start telling me about some fine legal point. I don't know what he's talking about, but it's enough for me to see how excited it makes him. He loves it, Julie. You can't take something like that away from him. It's just -- it's just I feel we're not really close any more. I mean, he comes home from school, lots of times I'm asleep already. And, when I do see him, he seems all involved with himself. He looks at me sometimes as if I were a stranger to him, and I feel sometimes I am. I'm afraid of that, Julie. \nJULIE Then get rid of the baby. \nIt is said simply, inevitably, even innocently. It brings only a frown to Helen's face and a short silence. \nJULIE If I had it to do again, believe me, that's what I would do. \nHELEN (slowly becoming aware of the depth of what they are talking about) You don't mean that, Julie. \nJULIE Yes, I do. My children are the only things in my life now, but I would rather have a husband. \nCHARLIE I don't feel like going home. Are you going? Hang around, Kennie. It's only about nine thirty, ten. \nKENNETH It's after ten. It's about ten after ten. \nKenneth rips off a paper towel. The only noise for a moment is the soft crumpling of paper as Kenneth dries his hands. \nKENNETH The party's getting a little wild in there anyway. Eddie and Walter got poor Arnold nailed in there, they're trying to talk him into getting a girl. This party's going to wind up in a joint, let me tell you. This is a good time to blow. \nCHARLIE (frowning) Yeah.... I should have gone to class tonight. I'm paying twenty bucks a credit. The least I can do is go to class. \nHe breaks off abruptly, turning away with a sudden frown. \nCHARLIE I take one night off, I can't even enjoy myself. Did you know Eddie went back to Europe? \nKENNETH No, I didn't know that. \nCHARLIE He was telling me he lived in Paris for three months. I'd like to do that! \nHe ambles around the men's room, studying himself with unseeing eyes in the little mirror, poking the trash can into which Kenneth is now dropping his wadded paper towel. He suddenly turns to Kenneth, stares at him. Kenneth looks at him in mirror. \nKENNETH What's the matter? \nCHARLIE I'm going to quit. What am I killing myself for? \nKENNETH Quit what? \nCHARLIE Quit night school. Tonight was the first laughs I've had in years. I can't remember the last time I had so much fun. Look what I'm missing. I'm making a pretty good living. I can support a wife and baby on what I make. I'm going to quit! I mean it. I'm going to quit. Boy, what a time to have a baby. \nKENNETH You don't have to quit school because you're having a baby, Charlie. There are lots of guys go to night school with two, three kids. \nCHARLIE You ought to meet some of these guys. They're just grinding their lives away. It's an obsession with some of these guys. I mean, what's the point? So I'll go five more years to night school. So I'll get my degree. So I'll get a job as a junior accountant for three years at seventy-five bucks a week. I'm making better than that now. And then it just starts. The CPA exams. By the time I'm fifty, I can start living. At this point, I get a heart attack and an ulcer, and they bury me in the ground, and they say: \"That was Charlie Samson, the man who didn't see a movie in fifty years.\" Why go through all that? I'll quit. I feel so mad right now, you better keep an eye on me, Kennie, because I'm going to wind up punching somebody. \nThe door opens. Man enters to clean a spot off his tie. \nKENNETH Come on, let's go home. \nCHARLIE What do I want to go home for? \nKENNETH You're in a lousy mood. \nThe man, finished with his tie, exits. \nKENNETH (after a moment) Charlie, go home. I can see you're going to get fried tonight and wind up picking up a tramp and you're going to wake up in the morning feeling like two-bits. \nCHARLIE It'd be a profit. \nKENNETH Charlie, about five years ago, I went without a job for seven months. Alice was carrying our first baby. We were living on money I borrowed from my brother. I don't know if you remember me in those days, but it was rough. I used to go out every night, put a load on, and make a pass at any girl who looked at me. And I mean any. Big, tall, short, fat, anything. Well, one night I picked up some tomato somewheres, and we were sitting in a bar or somewheres, and I kept calling her Alice all night. So she says to me: \"My name ain't Alice. Who's Alice?\" So I said: \"Alice is my wife,\" and I got up and I went home. \nCharlie waits a moment for Kenneth to continue, but apparently this is all Kenneth has to offer at the moment. \nCHARLIE What does that mean? \nKENNETH I don't know. I had a point when I started telling that story. \nCHARLIE ...No, I'll stick around another hour or so.... \nEDDIE ... That's my boy.... \nARNOLD (to Kenneth, who is looking at Charlie) ... Honestly, I never expected any presents.... \nKENNETH (to Charlie) ... Aren't you coming home? ... \nCHARLIE ... What for? Sit around talking to my sister Julie? ... \nARNOLD (standing) ... I want to thank all you fellows ... \nEDDIE All right, stop thanking them, Arnold. They just gave you a party, they didn't elect you President. \nARNOLD ... This has been one of the nicest nights of my life.... \nCHARLIE Let's go someplace ... let's go to a nightclub. \nEDDIE That's great with me. \nCHARLIE Come on, Ken. \nARNOLD Thanks a lot. \nKENNETH ... Well, listen, fellows, I'm cutting out.... Good night, Walter, Eddie. (to Charlie) ... You coming, Charlie? ... \nCHARLIE ... No, I'll kill another hour.... Come on, Kennie.... \nKENNETH No, you go ahead. I'll see you in the morning, Charlie. \nCHARLIE Okay, I'll see you. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXTERIOR. THIRD STREET The little stretch of strip-joints on Third Street. Bright little cluster of honky-tonks. \nEXTERIOR. THIRD STREET Our bachelor party, now down to four carousers, ambles along the rather filled sidewalk, looking at the cardboard cutouts of the strippers in the windows of the night clubs. \nThe four men pause before one of the strip-joints, examining the cardboard cutout and billboard which promises first-rate entertainment inside. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. THIRD STREET NIGHT CLUB We look down on the whole night club, showing the dark, dingy, crowded, smallness of it. There is a strip going on. It doesn't look very interesting. \nOur four men are huddled over a very small table in one of those Third Street clip-joints. It is a dark little hovel, but a blue stage light drifts across the table, vaguely illuminating our four celebrators. Behind them, a strip tease is in progress. Every now and then, an almost stout woman in her forties, garish in the blue spotlight, dressed in a white satin ill-fitting gown, moves in and out of our view. Half the tables and wall booths are occupied. There is a horseshoe bar off in the recesses of the club. A three- piece band is playing spiritlessly. \nWalter is gone, deep in some painful, drunken world of his own. Charlie rubs his eyes as if to keep his senses awake. Arnold, who is soggy, is leaning toward Eddie, who alone of the four men is giving any attention to the show. \nARNOLD So what do you think of my girl, Eddie? You met her. Be honest with me. Tell me the truth. I had the feeling you didn't like her. \nEDDIE Come on, come on, Arnold. What do you want from me. \nArnold turns to Charlie. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT Our four amble along Washington Square North, headed west. In the background, the high apartment houses. It is about midnight now, and there are a number of people around, and there are lots of lights in the windows. There is still the feeling of life. However, some of the wind has gone out of our bachelor party since we last saw them carousing on Lexington Avenue. Now, of course, there are only four of them, and there is somewhat a feeling of straggling about them. \nEXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT The four men straggle along Tenth Street east of Seventh Avenue. This is a dark little street. Off at the intersection, you can see Seventh Avenue and an occasional car moving downtown, but West Tenth Street right now seems an empty, sleeping street of dark and old little apartment houses. The houses sometimes have little stoops. On one of the stoops, there is a woman sitting. She is in her thirties, not attractive nor unattractive. She wears a light summer frock, and she has one shoe off, and she is toying with the idea of pushing the other one off too. As the four men approach her, she looks up, half quizzically, half questioningly. The four men note her in passing and seem to continue on, but then come to a dragging halt about ten paces down. \nCLOSE GROUP SHOT OF THE FOUR MEN. \nEDDIE I think we've got one for you, Arnold. \nARNOLD One what? \nEddie looks back to the woman on the stoop. They all turn to look. Actually, Charlie has ambled a few paces even further down and doesn't know quite why they've stopped. They look at the woman; the woman looks at them a little warily. Rest of the scene from her point of view. \nARNOLD Ah, come on, Eddie. \nEDDIE She ain't bad. \nCHARLIE (calling from a few paces down) What's the matter? \nEDDIE We've got a live one. \nARNOLD (starting to walk) Come on, let's go. \nEDDIE Arnold, for Pete's sake. \nCHARLIE Ah, leave him alone! He doesn't want to. \nEDDIE Come on. We've been walking around all night here -- are you a man, or ain't you? \nArnold frowns. \nARNOLD All right, all right. \nWith a scowl, he assumes the responsibility of being a man. The four men, Charlie bringing up the rear, move down toward The Woman, who now looks down at her feet and begins wiggling her bare foot back into the unused shoe. \nTHE WOMAN (not looking up) I don't know who you fellows think I am, but you fellows have the wrong idea about me. \nEDDIE Yeah, I know. Arnold, see that bar down the corner. That's where we'll be. \nTHE WOMAN I'm afraid you fellows have the wrong idea about me. \nARNOLD She says we have the wrong idea. \nCHARLIE Ah, leave him alone. \nTHE WOMAN You fellows are working under a misconception. \nEddie and Walter have already started down the street to the bar. \nEDDIE We'll be in the bar, Arnold. \nCHARLIE You all right, Arnold? \nArnold's head has started to shake nervously, and he opens the door and steps out into the landing. The Woman, beginning to get angry, follows him. \nINTERIOR. LANDING Charlie looks up at the opening of the door and Arnold's entrance. The Woman stands in the doorway. Arnold moves quickly past Charlie about halfway down the landing, white- faced and trembling. \nTHE WOMAN (getting a little shrill) What's the matter? Hey. Hey, you. Hey, you, what's the matter? \nCHARLIE Let's go. (to The Woman) What's the trouble? \nTHE WOMAN I don't know. Ask him. What's the matter? Hey, you. You, what's the matter? \nCHARLIE Go back inside.... All right, all right. \nTHE WOMAN How about that, huh? \nShe turns angrily, goes back into her room (ad libbing as she crosses) and slams the door. Charlie moves down the landing to Arnold, who looks at him wide-eyed, almost in terror. \nCHARLIE What happened, Arnold? \nARNOLD I don't know. I'm just scared. \nCHARLIE Yeah, I don't blame you, I'd be scared too like this. I don't know why we dragged you up here in the first place. It's a barbaric custom. Come on. \nHe has taken Arnold's arm and would lead him down the stairs, but Arnold pauses again at the first step. \nARNOLD Don't tell Eddie. \nCHARLIE No I won't, Arnold. \nARNOLD Why don't we just sit here for ten minutes or so? \nCharlie frowns, then shrugs. \nCHARLIE All right, Arnold. \nThey both sit slowly on the steps. Arnold is still trembling from the whole terrifying experience. \nARNOLD Don't ever tell anybody. \nCHARLIE It's nothing to be ashamed of. \nARNOLD Please, Charlie. \nCHARLIE I won't tell anybody. \nA man's voice suddenly calls down from an upper floor. \nMAN'S VOICE Anything wrong down there? \nCHARLIE (calling back) No. No. Nothing wrong. \nCharlie sits. CAMERA MOVES UP CLOSER to both men. The whole experience has depressed Charlie, and it shows on his face. \nCAMERA PULLS SLOWLY BACK so that we get the small, sordid feeling of the two men, somewhat tight, sitting on a dirty ill-lit staircase outside a whore's bedroom. \nCHARLIE Yeah. \nEDDIE You know what we can do? We'll take the crosstown. We'll go over to Charlie's house, he'll get some money, and we'll go to this nutty night club. It's right down on Second Avenue. You got any money home, Charlie? \nCHARLIE What do you say, Arnold? You want to go? \nArnold shrugs. Eddie has started for the door already. Charlie wearily gets off his stool, starts to follow Eddie out. Walter takes his arm. \nEDDIE Charlie, get Walter. \nCHARLIE Come on, Walter.... \nCLOSEUP of Walter \nWALTER I'm going to die, you know what I mean? \nThe sad little party files wearily out of the bar, Arnold pausing at the bar to pay for the drinks. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. FOURTEENTH STREET CROSSTOWN SUBWAY \nLONG SHOT looking down through the length of one almost empty car, through the open door at the end of the car, down into the next almost empty car. Just a few people riding the subway at this hour, half past eleven on a week-day. But down in the second car, we can see our four cavaliers. Eddie, Arnold, and Charlie are sitting. Our attention is most caught by Walter, who is heavily drunk and weaves and lurches up and down the central aisle of the car. We cannot hear if he is saying anything. \nCLOSE SHOT Walter weaving up and down the aisle of the car. He stumbles on the toes of a man in a windbreaker, sitting in the car. \nWALTER (mumbling) Excuse me ... excuse me ... (turns his blurred attention to Charlie, who, alone of the three, seems painfully interested in what Walter is talking about) So what'll I do? I mean, he says, I'm going to die. I mean, the man's a specialist. He says: \"Go to Arizona, go to Colorado,\" he says. \"You got to get out of New York or you're going to die.\" He tells my wife, the stupid idiot. My wife cried all night. I'm going to die, you know that? You understand that? I'm going to die? You know what an asthma attack is like? Your heart starts beating like a drum! I passed out the last time! \nCHARLIE (deeply compassionate) Walter, why don't you just quit the job and pack your bags and get out of here? \nWalter stands in front of Charlie, his lips moving, but no words coming out for a moment. There are tears in his eyes, and all the pain and anguish of the man's forty-eight years are clear on his face. \nWALTER (getting the words out) I can't quit. Don't you understand? You don't understand. I can't quit! I got a fourteen-year-old girl, I don't know what time she comes in at night any more. She's so wild, these kids. I got a nineteen-year-old boy in college; he's going to be a doctor if I have to die. He's not going to quit school. You hear me! I worked hard to put that kid in school! I don't care if I die! I don't care! What am I going to do in Arizona? Who wants me? Who's going to give me a job? What kind of a job am I going to get? I'm forty-eight years old. They don't want no forty-eight-year-old bookkeeper. They got machines from IBM. You ever been up on the ninth floor? You ever see all those IBM machines? What am I going to do out in Arizona? You look in the Help Wanted lately? You see any jobs listed for Bookkeeper, Male? What are you talking about? Do you know what you're talking about? \nCharlie reaches up to steady Walter, who has worked himself up into a lurching fury. \nCHARLIE Easy, Walter. \nWALTER (flinging Charlie's hand aside) Take your hand off me. You don't know nothing! You're just a kid! You don't know! I've seen death, kid. I've seen it, boy. I know what it looks like. (he staggers away a few paces down the aisle, stumbles over the man's toe again) Excuse me.... Forty-eight years old and so what? What does it mean? What happened? What have I got? What did I make? Who needs me? So this is it. A man's life, nothing. Worry about being sick, worry about making money, worry about your wife, worry about your kids, and you're on your way to the grave from the day you're born. The days drag on, and the years fly by, and so what? (cries out to the whole world) What is it all about? Will you tell me? \nThe train is slowing up for a station now. \nWALTER Life is nothing! It's a gag! It's a joke! It's a mortgage! It's a bankrupt! It's a lot of noise over nothing! Sound and fury! Isn't that what the man said? What do you think, I never read a book? I read a book! Don't worry! I was a bright kid! Everybody thought I was going to be the first Catholic to be President! Where did it all go?! \nHe turns to look at the station they are edging into, the yellow lights, the dark shadows, the few blurred faces. His face is wet with the tiny rivulets left by tears. \nWALTER (mumbling) Where did it all go? \nThe train stops, the green doors slide open. \nEDDIE (looking out, in a low voice) Where are we, Third Avenue? \nARNOLD (low voice) Where are we getting off? Next stop? \nCHARLIE In the back there. You can't see it from here. \nLONG SHOT of Stuyvesant Town as seen from their point of view. PAN SLOWLY ACROSS, capturing the silent monotony of the dark buildings. Only a few of the windows are still lit. \nEDDIE It looks like a state hospital. \nCHARLIE It looks like a prison. \nEDDIE Yeah, it does look a little like a prison. \nThe three men just stand, worn out, tired. \nCHARLIE (suddenly) I'm going home. \nHe starts to walk to the buildings, across the little street that separates the corner of Fourteenth Street and First Avenue from the parallel corner of the housing project. \nEDDIE (calling after him) Hey, Charlie ... \nCharlie turns. \nEDDIE Hey, Charlie! What about the money? Have you got ten bucks? \nCHARLIE (after a moment) All right, if you want to walk me to the house, I'll get you ten bucks. \nEddie has to take a moment to consider this. Then he shuffles across the little street toward Charlie. Charlie doesn't quite wait for him to catch up when he turns and leads the way between two cars and up the sidewalk toward the promenade that leads to the heart of the project. Arnold, after a moment, follows Eddie. The three men disappear single-file into the darkness of Stuyvesant Town. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. LANDING OUTSIDE CHARLIE'S APARTMENT We are looking at the twin elevator doors. The light of an elevator climbs into the little square window of one of the elevator doors. The door opens, and Charlie, Eddie, and Arnold shuffle out into the landing. They are all a little soggy. \nCHARLIE (mutters) I'll be right out. \nHe moves around the turn of the wall, fishes in his pocket for the key to his apartment. He finds it, brings it out, opens the door carefully, goes into his apartment. \nINTERIOR. CHARLIE AND HELEN'S APARTMENT Charlie comes in. The dining area is lit, and there is the lamp lit in the living room. As Charlie moves to the living room, we can see that Helen is seated on the couch, watching television. The gray-white light of the television set drifts out into the room. Helen is in her pajamas and she has washed for bed; her face is devoid of make-up. She is half-watching television; the rest of her attention is devoted to cutting her fingernails and other aspects of manicure. She looks up as Charlie comes into the living room, smiles. \nHELEN Hiya, have a nice time? \nCharlie shrugs. He is depressed and can't conceal it. \nCHARLIE I'm taking ten bucks. A couple of the guys are waiting outside. I promised them I'd loan them ten bucks. \nHELEN Sure. \nHe stands by the couch now, without interest, automatically watching the television set. \nCHARLIE (looking at the set) Tomorrow's payday. I'll get it back tomorrow. \nHELEN It's in the drawer. \nA kind of ennui has engulfed him. He stands, watching the television set out of which is now pouring the end of an animated cartoon commercial. Then the familiar tinkling music sets in, the inscription, \"The Late Show\" appears on the screen, and the announcer's voice informs us that we are now going back to the late show, starring Rex Harrison in \"Strictly Dishonorable.\" The whole thing brings a wince of pain to Charlie's face, and he turns and moves wearily through the little foyer into the darkened bedroom. Enough light flows in from the other rooms to show Charlie going to the drawer in the chest of drawers and taking out a ten-dollar bill. He returns the other bills, closes the drawer and just stands there, suddenly so weak and exhausted that he has to steady himself with one hand on the chest of drawers. \nBack in the living room, Helen still sits, a slight frown now indicating she is sensitive to the deeply depressed mood her husband is in. She continues with her nails for a moment. Then, wondering what is keeping her husband, she stands and goes to the bedroom doorway and looks in. \nCHARLIE Hey Arnold-- You okay, Arnold? \nArnold makes no answer. Charlie regards his prostrated friend expressionlessly for a moment. Then turns and shuffles aimlessly back to the group around the piano in the living room. He looks over to the stairway again. The Existentialist is alone now, The Landlord having gone for the moment. She is looking at Charlie, and he drops his eyes. He turns away from the piano and moves out a few steps into the middle of the living room. He moves to the stairway. The Existentialist looks up at him as he approaches, Charlie kind of nods to her, and, for a moment, she just sits and he just stands. Then ... \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST That old man I was talking to before? That's my landlord. About ten thirty last night, someone began pounding on my door. So I got up and opened the door, and there was this white-haired man with  a pince-nez standing there. I said: \"What do you want?\" So he said: \"I'm the landlord, and I want the rent.\" Well, I just looked at him because the landlord I knew was a Hungarian man named Frank, who was crazy about me, and the issue of rent never came up, you see. Well, it turned out that this man with the pince-nez had just bought the building the day before and he kept grabbing my arm and saying he wanted the rent. Well, then I got the point, of course. Well, meanwhile, a boy named Bob I knew had come over. He's engaged to a Javanese girl with wonderful planes in her face who lives at the International House. But he's crazy about me and he drops in about twice a week. Well, meanwhile, my new landlord was grabbing my arm and kept quoting poetry to me which he was trying to pass off as his own. He was an absolute fraud. He scotched the whole thing from Baudelaire. \"Tu mettrais.\" You know that one. Well, he kept screaming about the rent -- I didn't like him, you know -- and I called this boy named George who used to live in Poughkeepsie when I was going to Vassar, and he's crazy about me. He lives in St. Luke's place now, but he goes to Poughkeepsie every Wednesday to see his mother, he's got an Oedipus, so that was out. Well, my new landlord kept telling me how much he was in love with me. I said: \"How existentialist can you get? You just met me five minutes ago.\" He was absolutely crazy about me. \nCharlie has been sort of half-listening to all this. His attention, if any at all, has been vaguely given to the girl's bare arms, the lines of her body. \nCHARLIE (resigned) You have an apartment around here somewheres? (looks up to second floor) What's up there? What kind of rooms are up there? \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST So, I finally got to sleep around six thirty.... \nCharlie bends down to her, takes her arm. \nCHARLIE Come on, let's go. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST (wrenching her arm away) No! Oh, stop trying to be so primitive. \nCharlie straightens with an irritated sigh. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST I find you very unpleasant. \nHe stands, she sits in sullen silence. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST There's nothing upstairs. (suddenly rises, mumbles) Oh, I don't care. \nShe starts up the stairs, Charlie following close behind her. They pick their way past the other people sitting on the stairs to the second-floor landing. They walk in hostile silence down the landing to the bedroom door, which she opens. \nINTERIOR. THE BEDROOM It is a tiny bedroom. The bed is covered with purses and summer stoles and other guest things. An uncovered, improvised closet, really a rack of hanging dresses and things, gives the room an overburdened look. Charlie comes into the room after her, closes the door, looks for the latch. She pushes some of the things on the bed aside and sits down and waits while Charlie latches the door, a matter of turning a bent nail into locking position. She begins to prattle again. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST So I finally got to sleep around six thirty this morning. At nine thirty, someone began pounding on my door again. I got out of bed and opened the door, and there was my landlord with the pince-nez wearing a blue silk kimono. \"Oh, for heaven's sakes,\" I said, \"what do you want now?\" He said: \"I'm the landlord, and I want the rent.\" I said: \"You're an old man, go to sleep.\" Then the phone rang. It was a boy named Andrew I know who teaches physics at Columbia University, and he's insanely jealous. He's married and has four children, but he keeps badgering me to run away with him to Nicaragua, throw up his professorship and all that. Well, my landlord began shouting some garbled Baudelaire at the top of his lungs, and a little Verlaine, and a little Huysmans. He apparently has some kind of fetish about French decadents. And naturally, Andrew heard him, and he got furious, and he said: \"Who's that I hear?\" I said, \"That's the landlord.\" He said: \"What does he want?\" I said: \"He wants the rent.\" Well, at this point, I felt like chucking the whole business and going back to Bessemer City and going to work in my father's hardware store. \nCharlie has stood a moment, listening to this bizarre story. Then he has busied himself cleaning a place beside The Existentialist on the bed. He brings an end to the rococo narration by putting his arms around The Existentialist and in a moment, she responds hungrily. \nCLOSEUP of Charlie and The Existentialist in a desperate embrace. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST (muttering) Just say you love me. \nCHARLIE What? \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST Just say you love me. You don't have to mean it. \nHe tries to kiss her again, himself charged high at the moment, but she turns her face away from him. The dialogue is intense, whispered, hungry. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST No, don't. ... \nCHARLIE What's the matter? \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST Say you love me.... \nCHARLIE Come on. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST Say you love me.... \nCHARLIE Yeah. I guess so. \nARNOLD (stiff with liquor) Eddie -- Eddie. So what do you think, Eddie? You think I ought to go through with this marriage? \nEDDIE I don't know about you, Arnold, but if it was me, boy, I'd be in China by now. (back to Charlie) Who have the Yankees got on first? Skowron. Boy, how they touted Skowron. All right, he's having a lucky year. \nCHARLIE Yeah.... \nEDDIE (continuing) ... Well, I mean, is there any argument? Hodges is the best first baseman in both leagues.... \nARNOLD So, Eddie, what do you think? You think I ought to marry her, go to China, or what? \nEDDIE Arnold, if it bothers you so much, call her up and tell her to forget the whole deal. (back to Charlie) All right Hodges is having a bad year -- but how about last year? He hit over .300. He only hit thirty- five homers and he drove in over a hundred runs---- \nARNOLD So, Eddie... \nEDDIE Arnold! Get rid of her! You're driving me crazy! \nArnold lowers his head, and he rises, loses his precarious balance and moves backward a few lurching steps. \nEDDIE (continuing) All right, who's on second? We got Charlie Neal or Gilliam, for that matter, and this isn't even counting Jackie Robinson, head and shoulders, even with a trick knee, the best second baseman in both leagues if they'd let him play there. We got three guys, for Pete's sake, who can outplay anybody the Yankees put on second. \nArnold weaves slowly up the bar to the two phone booths at the far end of the counter. Then walks out of shot. \nEDDIE (continuing) Ever see Charlie Neal go to his right? That Yankee guy, what's his name -- he can't go to his right. And don't forget Neal gets a lot of bases on balls, and once he's on the bases, man, it unnerves the pitcher ... \nThe bartender decides to take issue. \nBARTENDER What's Brooklyn going to do for pitching? \nEDDIE Never heard of Newcombe? Never heard of Erskine? \nBARTENDER What have you got to compare with Ford, Kucks, McDermott, Turley--- \nEDDIE McDermott -- McDermott hasn't pitched a full game since last year. \nBARTENDER The best relief pitcher in both leagues. \nEDDIE What's the matter with Eddie Roebuck? \nBARTENDER How do you compare Eddie Roebuck with McDermott? \nEDDIE What are you, a Yankee fan? \nBARTENDER Yeah. \nEDDIE Well, drop dead. (turns angrily back to Charlie) A Yankee fan. \nThere is a sudden bellow off. \nARNOLD'S VOICE Hey! \nEddie and Charlie slowly turn to look in Arnold's direction. CAMERA PANS to see Arnold from their point of view, a wavering, drunken young man standing in front of the phone booths. \n", "test1_input": "HELEN Hiya, Julie. I was beginning to think you weren't coming. \nJULIE (coming in) I was at my mother's house. Did they call you? They said they were going to call you. \nHELEN Yeah, your mother was very sweet. \nJULIE You should have seen my father. I said, \"Pa, you have another grandchild coming.\" So he said, \"Who?\" So I said, \"Charlie.\" So he said, \"That little Helen?\" So I said, \"If it isn't that little Helen, Charlie better leave town.\" So out came the beer. Well, they've been after Charlie to have a baby for a long time now. I said, \"Pa, leave him alone. Let him get established before he saddles himself with a baby.\" Anyway, I want you to know joy reigns supreme in your in-laws' house. (she moves into the kitchen) How's Charlie taking it? \nHELEN (following her into the kitchen) Listen, let me make you a cup of tea or something. \nJULIE No, no, I've been drinking beer for the last two hours, celebrating your baby. \nHELEN Soda, anything like that? \nJULIE No, honey, you go on with your wash. Is that what you're doing? (she sits) When I had my first baby, Mike was ashamed to be seen on the streets with me. Well, listen, he was interning at the time. We needed a baby like a hole in the head. That's why he's a general practitioner now, because of that baby. He was studying to be a surgeon. He absolutely refused to admit I was pregnant. Even in my ninth month, and I was as big as a house. He used to walk ten paces in front of me in the street like he didn't know who that woman with the belly was. Where is Charlie anyway? \nHELEN I told you he-- \nJULIE Oh, yeah. I wouldn't let my Mike go on a bachelor party. \nHELEN (turning back to her wash) What are they going to do, get a little drunk? \nJULIE Are you kidding? What do you think these bachelor parties are for, bachelors? This is for the married men. It's a good excuse to get drunk and find some girls. \nHELEN Can you picture Charlie getting drunk and picking up a girl? Charlie's old sobersides. You should have seen what I went through to get him to make a pass at me. He's so sweet. Nobody knows how really sweet he is, he's so quiet all the time. My brother died in September, he used to stay up with me till three, four o'clock every night. I used to cry all night, and he used to sit on the bed and talk with me. I used to look at him talking there, and I used to think: \"What would I do without this sweet man here? I'd go crazy.\" You know, you like to be a little cynical sometimes, Julie. \nJULIE Wait'll you've been married eleven years. \nHELEN You like to talk about all the affairs everybody's husband is having. Do you know actually one woman whose husband is actually playing around? \nAn abrupt, sad expression, tinged with pain, has come over Julie's face. She looks down at the table. \nJULIE Wait'll you've been married eleven years. \nHelen, aware that she has perhaps touched on a sensitive subject, frowns and turns back to her washing. A quick, thick silence dips into the room. \nJULIE (looking down) Wait'll Charlie gets to be forty-two. My Mike's having an affair right now with one of his patients right now. We don't talk about it -- don't you, either, not even to Charlie. But Mike knows I know about it. I even know the patient. A married woman with a hyperthyroid problem. My Mike's a good doctor with a pretty good practice. The kids are crazy about him. But every now and then he has to go out and get involved with a woman. \nShe looks down at her hands in her lap. \nJULIE Listen, I will take a cup of tea if you've got one. \nShe stands, opens the pantry, looks around among the cans and packages for a box of tea bags. \nHELEN (quite shocked) You're kidding, aren't you? \nJULIE (finds the box of tea bags) Would I kid about something like that? \nShe puts the box of tea bags an the workshelf, unhooks a saucepan hanging over the stove, turns to the sink and fills it with water. Helen regards her, not quite knowing what to say. Julie sets the saucepan going on the stove, stares at it. \nJULIE I don't know why I told you. Don't tell anybody, not even Charlie. I don't want the family to know. But this woman isn't the first one. I know that much. About three years ago, the doorbell rings. I open the door. There's a man there. He says: \"Tell your husband to stay away from my sister.\" How would you like to open the door and have somebody say that to you? I cried for two weeks. I don't know what to do about it, Helen. Should I bring it out in the open with Mike or should I just keep my mouth shut like the other time? Because he's not going to leave me. Even if he doesn't care about me, he has his kids to think about. We married too young. That was our big mistake. We married too young. \nHer face, her whole body suddenly tightens to forestall any possibility of breaking into tears, and she sits down abruptly on the kitchen stool, her eyes clenched tight and her face rigidly impassive. Helen remains nervously silent. \n", "test1_true": "She stands abruptly and moves quickly past Helen out the kitchen doorway into the dark living room, leaving Helen standing troubled, concerned, in the kitchen. After a moment, Helen moves to the kitchen doorway and a step out into the dining area. She looks through the dark living room to the gray silhouette of Julie standing by the living room window, her form lightly outlined by a tracing of moonlight. \nHELEN Are you all right, Julie? \nJULIE (muttering) I'm all right. I'm all right. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. BACHELOR'S APARTMENT (45 MINUTES LATER) We are looking back up the living room as we were at the close of the last scene in this apartment. The room is absolutely dark now, but a light pours in from the foyer. In this shaft of light, we can see Eddie moving from behind the projector to the wall switch and turning on the lights. The room is abruptly bright with light, and our five men squint against the sudden glare. They have all changed their positions and taken off their jackets and loosened their ties. They are lolling about. CAMERA LOOKS DOWN TO THE FLOOR to take particular note of eight empty beer bottles, an opened fifth of bourbon, ash trays, crumpled packs of cigarettes, a cup and saucer, somebody's shoes, somebody's jacket that has fallen off the back of a chair. Over this we hear Walter's voice: \nWALTER Is that the last one? \nEDDIE Yeah. \nA thick silence fills the room. There is a kind of sodden feeling to this scene. After a long moment, Walter's voice again: \nWALTER Ah, you've seen one, you've seen them all. \nKENNETH Yeah, they're all alike. \nCHARLIE I don't know -- I think the first one was all right. \nWALTER Yeah, I was so bored by the rest of them. I nearly fell asleep during the last one. \nKENNETH You in the habit of sleeping with your eyes open? \nWe look down on the room now, at all five of the men, Eddie rewinding the last reel, the little motor of the projector humming. The others loll about, their legs dangling over the armrests of the soft chairs and sofas. There is a heavy, dense mood that no one seems willing to break. \nCHARLIE What time's it about, anybody know? \nARNOLD (glancing at his watch) I got a quarter to nine. \nEDDIE No, it's later than that, about a quarter after. \nAgain the silence falls upon the five men. Only the humming little motor interrupts the thick silence. Nobody moves. \nWALTER (after a moment) Ah, you see one, you've seen them all. \nAgain the silence. Charlie stretches over for his bottle of beer on the floor beside his chair. He pours what's left of the bottle into the glass standing beside it. Otherwise nobody moves. \nWALTER (after a moment) So that's the last one you've got to show us, Eddie? \nEDDIE Yeah. You want to run them backwards? \nKENNETH I wonder where they get the girls to make these movies? \nWALTER Might as well go home, I guess. \nKENNETH Yeah. \nThe idea doesn't seem to propel anybody to any decisive movement. Walter shifts his position on the sofa, stretches out his legs, regards his shoes with a sudden sadness. \n", "test1_id": 1239, "test2_input": "CHARLIE I don't care what I do either. \nHelen neither moves nor makes a response. Charlie goes on into the living room and shuffles to the front door, his long body heavy with pain and guilt and dense, unknown terrors. He opens the door and goes out onto the landing. \nINTERIOR. LANDING Eddie and Arnold, looking up as the door opens and Charlie comes out. \nEDDIE What took you so long? What did you do, blow open the safe? \nCHARLIE (giving Eddie the ten-dollar bill) Here. \nEDDIE (taking it) I'll give it to you tomorrow. I'll see you in the morning, Charlie. \nCHARLIE I'll see you. \nEddie takes Arnold's arm and guides him back around the turn of the wall to the elevators. Charlie follows a few paces behind. Eddie pushes both elevator buttons. Charlie nods, looks down at the tiling at his feet, fairly sick within himself, oppressed and guilty. The light in the elevator window shows, and Eddie opens the door. \nCHARLIE Wait a minute. I'll go with you. \nEDDIE Let's go to that party -- we'll have a ball! \nCharlie shuffles the few paces forward and follows Eddie and Arnold into the elevator. The door closes, and, a moment later, the light of the elevator cage disappears downward. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. GREENWICH VILLAGE DUPLEX APARTMENT This is one of those duplex apartments on West Tenth Street which consists of one huge living room that is two stories high and you need a little rolling stepladder to reach the books on the upper shelves of the built-in bookcases. There is a little wrought-iron stairway that leads to the second floor, which consists of two tiny little bedrooms. \nApartments like these, as is the case in this one, are usually lived in by two girls, one of whom is a secretary in an advertising agency and the other a model for a garment manufacturing firm. Both girls are in their early thirties and are milling about somewhere in the mass of people in the living room, carrying drinks, laughing up a storm, pausing at the little knots of discussion groups with an apt phrase. They rather think of themselves as Madame de Sta\u00ebls with their own salon of bright young people, for most of the men and women at the party are in some way connected with the arts, probably in an avant garde way. It is a little difficult to tell this by looking at them because avant garde artists have become obsessed with dressing like businessmen, but if you can hear the talk as we can, you get the point fast enough. We pick up phrases like: \"I really find it difficult to think of Tennessee Williams as a serious artist,\" or \"My teacher thinks all tenors are frogs except Gigli,\" or \"I don't see how you can say that; his designs fairly throb with sex.\" There are, as Eddie predicted, a number of people sitting on the floor, mostly girls, circled in the swirl of their Ann Fogarty dresses, and there is one obvious ballerina, with her black hair pulled tightly back into a severe pony tail, using the wrought-iron railing that separates the dropped living room from the small entrance foyer to demonstrate something about positions at the dancing bar. There is someone at the piano banging away, shouting his songs, but he is completely inaudible five feet away. A few people lean over the piano, apparently exhilarated by the songs. Thin blankets of smoke wreathe their way up to the two-story-high ceiling. We catch some more phrases: \"I thought Truman Capote was supposed to be here.\" -- \"Truman's in Russia, I think.\" -- \"Good heavens, what can the Russians want with Truman Capote?\" -- \"Oh, I never read anything published in this country.\" \"Oh, I mean, the paper-bound Paris edition.\" In short, this is a real chi-chi wingding where all the furniture is too low, and the hostess is very proud of the fact that her end table is made out of an orange crate. \nSomewhere, through the jumble of the party, we can hear the doorbell chime. A young woman, at one of the little knots of people, perks her ears and says: \nHOSTESS I'm sure that's the police again. \nShe's very proud of this. She turns and weaves her way through the crowded room, carrying her drink. She goes up the step to the entrance foyer, turns to her left, picks her way over two middle-aged men who are both throwing a pitch at a fairly tight girl of eighteen, past the kitchen, which is a bedlam of ice cubes and kitchen towels and which is occupied at the moment by two intense women in their late thirties wrapped in deep discussion, up past two young men who have no immediate use for girls, to the front door of the apartment. She opens the door. \nGROUP SHOT of Eddie, Arnold, and Charlie from the Hostess's point of view. Not exactly a heartening sight to most hostesses, three fairly loaded young men with their collars unbuttoned and their ties limp and dangling. \nHOSTESS (beaming) Are you coming to complain about the noise? \nEDDIE Do we look like complainers? \nHOSTESS I don't know who you are, but come in, come in. I don't know half the people who are here tonight. \nThey enter a little warily and ill-at-ease, peering into the jammed room. \nHOSTESS The police have been here twice. The first fellow was just adorable. We gave him a drink, and he's upstairs in a bedroom now, for all I know. \nEDDIE Is that right? \nHOSTESS If you want something to drink, you'll just have to go into the kitchen and get it yourself. The place is just mad. Do you write, paint or sing? \nEddie spreads his arms in all-inclusive expansiveness. \nEDDIE Everything. \n", "test2_true": "CHARLIE Boy, do you get invited to a party like this or do you get committed? \nA passing young man who overhears this, pokes his head into the group and says to Charlie with a flashing smile: \nYOUNG CHAP I heard that. It's awfully funny. \nCharlie regards the smiling young chap. \nEDDIE Beat it. \nThe chap's smile flashes off and he scurries away. Eddie rubs his palms and surveys the women in the crowded room with a measuring eye. \nEDDIE This is going to be like shooting ducks. Pick out your duck, men. \nWetting his lips, he starts out for some girl he has decided on across the room. \nINTERIOR. GREENWICH VILLAGE APARTMENT -- HALF HOUR LATER \nHIGH SHOT showing progress of party, still crowded, still high. If we look sharp we can see Charlie seated on the floor in the rear of the shot, his back against the wall. \nCLOSER SHOT of Charlie sitting morosely, back against the wall, regarding his drink with sodden eyes. The chatter of the party, an occasional shrill laugh. \nFULL SHOT of Eddie coming out of the kitchen, carrying two drinks. He picks his way through the people to the living room with the general intention of getting to the arrangement of divans around the coffee table, when he spots Charlie and moves across to him. \nEDDIE Hey, what's the matter, Charlie? (squats down beside Charlie) \nCHARLIE (without looking up) Let's get out of here, Eddie. \nEDDIE The last time I saw you, you was with that girl you picked up. What happened? \nCHARLIE She's over there talking to that old guy with the glasses. \nTheir point of view, The Existentialist on steps with landlord. \nCHARLIE I didn't like her. She's one of these real Greenwich Village phonies. If I added up all the guys she told me about, she must have had her first boy friend when she was two years old. Where are you going, Eddie. Stick around a minute. \nEDDIE (who has stood) I'm with that one over there -- not bad, huh? I think she's a Communist. I think she's trying to talk me into joining the Party. \nCHARLIE How are you making out? \nEDDIE Not so hot. I may have to join. \nCHARLIE Hang around. Let's talk a bit. \nEDDIE I better get back. She's liable to recruit somebody else. \nCHARLIE Where's Arnold? \nEDDIE He's in the kitchen. I think he's out cold. I'll see you. \nCharlie nods as Eddie moves off. He returns his morose attention back to his glass of liquor. Then his eyes close, and his face, though impassive, shows pain. After a moment, he opens his eyes and slowly clambers to his feet and makes his way, a little unsteadily, through the living room in the direction of the kitchen. In the background we can hear the piano and somebody singing indistinguishable lyrics. Charlie gets to the kitchen door and looks in. Arnold is at the tiny kitchen table, head on the table, out cold. The kitchen is in a state of havoc. \n", "test2_id": 1240, "test3_input": "EDDIE (spiritlessly) Hey, honey, what are you, a Yankee fan or a Dodger fan? \nThe Bar Hag slowly turns to regard him over the rim of her glasses. \nBAR HAG Hiya. \nBleakly, Eddie shuffles slowly down the long length of the bar to where the battered old woman sits. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXTERIOR. THE BAR -- NIGHT \nHIGH ANGLE SHOT looking down on the sidewalk immediately outside the bar Arnold and Charlie have just come out of. There is a house with a small stoop, and Arnold is standing slumped by the stoop, holding himself up by the iron railing. He is being sick, quietly retching. Charlie is standing a few paces away from him in the middle of the sidewalk, a deeply unhappy figure in his own right. From our angle, we may or may not be able to tell that Charlie is crying. \nCLOSE SHOT of Charlie standing in the middle of the sidewalk of Sixth Avenue and Tenth Street, the whole dark world around him, silent and empty. He is crying quietly, unashamedly, his shoulders shaking ever so little.  Behind him, Arnold is bent over the railing of the stoop, weak and spent. \nANOTHER SHOT of the two men. Charlie stops crying, sighs, and starts toward Arnold. \nCHARLIE (gently) Are you all right, Arnold? \nArnold nods weakly. Charlie gets out a handkerchief and gives it to Arnold who begins to weakly clean his chin and spots on his suit. \nCHARLIE Would you like to go back in and sit down? \nArnold shakes his head weakly \"no.\" \nCHARLIE What subway do you take, Arnold, the BMT? Can you make it? \nArnold nods weakly. Charlie puts his arm supportively around his friend's back, but Arnold makes no move yet, being thoroughly drained. \nCHARLIE Come on, Arnold, I'll take you home. \nThere is a clicking of high heels on concrete pavement, and Charlie looks up. The Existentialist has just come out of the party several houses down and has come up a few steps and is standing watching them. She has her bag and her light summer stole. She nods to Charlie, sort of smiles, moves a few steps closer to them. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST Is he all right? \nCHARLIE (nods) Yeah, he's all right. Look, I've got to take my friend home... \nThe two men start slowly down the street to the corner. Arnold leaning heavily on his friend. The Existentialist stands, watching them a moment. \nTHE EXISTENTIALIST (calling lightly) Are you coming back? Where does he live? How long will you be? \nREVERSE SHOT Charlie and Arnold just about getting to the corner. Charlie hasn't heard her. \nFULL SHOT of The Existentialist watching them disappear around the corner. Then she turns, and, wetting her lips, she hurries back to the house where the party is. \nINTERIOR. BMT SUBWAY -- HURTLING NORTHWARD Half past three, and the car is absolutely empty except for Charlie and Arnold. Arnold is sprawled across the straw seat, one leg buckled beneath him, the other on the floor. He is sleeping heavily. Charlie sits expressionlessly, obviously involved in deep introspection. The car buckets along into the night. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. QUEENS APARTMENT HOUSE Arnold and Charlie coming up to a landing. It is the third floor; we can see enough of the corridor to see two apartment doors, lettered \"3D\" and \"3C.\" A small overhead bulb provides a thin sketchy light. Charlie and Arnold shuffle down the landing to apartment 3D. They pause outside the door. The scene is played in low mutters and whispers. \nARNOLD Well, thanks a lot, Charlie. \n", "test3_true": "ARNOLD Yeah, I'm all right. I'm a little groggy, but I'm awake anyway. You don't want to come in, do you? \nCHARLIE No, I don't think so. \nARNOLD I think my father and mother are up. I hear voices. My girl must have called them because they wouldn't be up at this hour. \nCHARLIE Well, you just go in and explain to them that you were drunk, and you're sorry, and you'll call your girl the first thing in the morning because she must really be upset about this. \nARNOLD (who has been listening at his door) I think she's here. \nCHARLIE Who? \nARNOLD My girl. I think I hear her voice in there. \nCHARLIE Well, be nice to her, Arnold. Remember, you woke her up in the middle of the night and probably scared her to death. \nARNOLD What'll I say to her, Charlie? \nCHARLIE I don't know, Arnold. What do you feel like saying to her? Do you really love this girl? Do you want to marry her? Are you marrying this girl because your family wants you to marry her, or why? \nARNOLD I think I like her, Charlie. It's just that I'm afraid I won't make a good husband. \nCHARLIE Well, tell her what you told me, Arnold. Tell her you're scared, and that you don't think you'll make a good husband. If she's a halfway decent girl, she'll try to understand how you feel, and, if she loves you, she's going to make it her job to make you happy. That's what love is, Arnold, when you have somebody else in the world you want to be happy. My wife, Arnold, I don't know what I'd do without her. Arnold, I've got a tough grind ahead of me. Work all day, I'll go to night school at night. But my wife knows that I need this to be happy, and she does everything she knows to help me. And we've got a baby coming. But if you love that baby and you love your wife, then it's easy. Everything seems so easy to me now -- I don't know why I even thought of quitting. (tears have welled in his eyes, and he hurriedly puts his hand to his face shading his reddening eyes) Arnold, I want my wife so much right now. I want her to be happy. I want to just go home and hold her and tell her how much she means to me. I mean, even Walter, he's going to die, but don't you think he'll be in tomorrow morning, same old Walter, jokes and laughs? He's got somebody to live for. He's even got somebody to die for. I mean, how rich can a man be? And poor Eddie -- I used to be so jealous of him. I used to think he was so free. Free from what? From loving a woman, from really wanting a woman. Arnold, what I'm trying to tell you is life is nothing if you don't love somebody but life is wonderful if you do love somebody. Arnold, I want my wife so much right now ... \nArnold is a little embarrassed by his friend's display of emotion and, frankly, hasn't understood a word Charlie was talking about. \nARNOLD I'm going to tell her about that woman tonight and everything. I'll tell her about that woman. \nCHARLIE Arnold, I want to get home so much to my wife right now I'm going to bust. \nARNOLD I'll see you, Charlie. \nCHARLIE Good-bye, Arnold, have a nice honeymoon. I'll see you when you get back. \nARNOLD I'll see you, Charlie. \nBut he is talking to an empty staircase. Charlie has plunged down into the darkness of the floor below. Arnold turns and sighs and shuffles back to the door of his apartment. He rings the bell lightly, takes a deep breath. A moment, and the door opens. A girl of about thirty-five, bespectacled, rather plain, with a sensitive face, stands in the doorway. Arnold stands, his head down in shame. \nARNOLD Hello, Louise. I'm very sorry, honest. \nLOUISE Sure, Arnold, I know. \nShe looks anxiously over Arnold's shoulder to see if anyone else is there. Arnold lumbers past her into the apartment. Voices, both male and female, pop out at him. \"What's the matter with you, are you crazy?\" \"What's the matter with you?\" \"For heaven's sakes, where have you been?\" ... The door closes. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXTERIOR. STUYVESANT TOWN HOUSING PROJECT \nLONG SHOT looking down the wide courtyard of Stuyvesant Town, its endless little pathways winding from the various apartment house doors to the central pathway which leads to a stairway to the street. It is half past five in the morning. The sky is gray and desolate. The courtyard and any other street we see is absolutely empty. THE CAMERA PANS OVER this empty expanse to the stairway where Charlie appears now, coming quickly up the steps. He moves down the central sidewalk, a little faster than he would usually walk; you have the feeling he is exerting an effort to keep from running.

{"test1_input": "THE BACHELOR PARTY \nby Paddy Chayefsky \nFADE IN. \nEXTERIOR. STUYVESANT TOWN HOUSING PROJECT -- DAY. Under the credits, the CAMERA PANS slowly across the project, capturing the sober monotony, the endless straight apartment houses. Seven o'clock in the morning. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM The bedroom of a two-and-a-half-room apartment in the housing project. It is early morning, but the shades are drawn and the room is dark. CAMERA moves slowly across the room, over the large double bed on which Charlie and Helen Samson, a young couple in their late twenties, are sleeping. They are sleeping more or less on their sides, facing away from each other. One of Helen's pajama-clad legs projects from under the light covers. We close in on Charlie's sleeping face. \nThe alarm clock at a distant end of the room suddenly bursts into a soft relentless buzz. Charlie's eyes open. There is a muffled movement at his side, and Helen gets up on one elbow. Then she sits up, rises, and pads barefooted -- a rather pretty girl in rumpled pajamas -- to the alarm clock and turns it off. Charlie's head turns on the pillow so that he can watch her. She pads back to the bed now and stands at the foot, looking down at her husband. She produces a smile, then turns and shuffles into the bathroom where she turns on the wall switch. A shaft of light now pours into the bedroom. \nCharlie sits up in bed. His shoes and socks are on the floor by his feet. He reaches down and starts to put them on. Suddenly, from the recesses of the bathroom, Helen's rather vague soprano lifts into the first lines of a popular song. Then it stops as abruptly as it began. Charlie's head slowly turns to look at the bathroom, back again to the business of putting on his socks. His face is expressionless, but there is no mistaking the sodden distaste he has for the world today. \nHe just sits on the bed, a young man of twenty-nine, clad only in his pajama trousers, one sock dangling from his hand, his head hanging, his shoulders slumped. Behind him, the sudden noise of rushing tap water, then off. Then his wife comes back into the bedroom. She is carrying a bath towel with which she is drying her face. Finished, she drops the towel on the bed and begins to dress. A moment later, she pads around the corner of the bed to Charlie's front. She is still barefooted and wears her pajama top, but she has exchanged the trousers for a half-slip. Charlie hasn't moved a muscle since the effort required to lift one sock from the floor. \nHELEN You think it's too early to call my mother? \nCHARLIE I don't know. \nCharlie shrugs without looking up. Helen goes out of the bedroom, into the little square of foyer where there is a telephone table with a telephone on it. She dials, waits. In the bedroom, Charlie rubs his eyes with two fingers. \nHELEN (on phone) Hello, Ma, did I wake you up? This is Helen.... Well, I'll be going to work, and I wanted to get ahold of you before I left. I called you last night. Where were you and Pop anyway? I kept calling you every half hour up till one o'clock.... Oh, yeah? Did you have a nice time? ... \nCAMERA SLOWLY MOVES IN FOR CLOSEUP of Charlie in bedroom. \nHELEN'S VOICE Well, listen, Ma, I got something to tell you. I'm pregnant.... Yeah, pregnant.... Of course I'm sure. I've got the report back from the laboratory.... No, you wouldn't know him, Doctor Axelrod.... Second month. He says I can expect the baby in February.... Well, Grandma, act a little excited, will you? ... You bet I'm excited.... \nCLOSEUP OF CHARLIE He is not excited. If anything he is miserable. His bowed head rises slowly. The eyes open. He stares abstractedly ahead for a moment. Then he sighs a profound sigh of resignation. Then his eyes close again, and his head slowly sinks back to its previous abjection. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. THE KITCHEN -- HALF HOUR LATER Helen, dressed in skirt and blouse now, is preparing two cups of instant coffee, pouring hot water from the saucepan into the two cups. The toaster is ticking. A packaged loaf of white bread is open on the cupboard shelf. Finished with pouring the water, Helen sets the saucepan back on the stove and comes out into the dining area. The dinette table is covered from end to end by open textbooks, several very large accounting worksheets on which are scrawled meticulous numbers, a ruler, several pencils and a pen, an ash tray glutted with cigarettes, a cup and saucer. \nHELEN (calling to the bedroom) Do you need any of this or can I take them off the table? \nCharlie appears in the bedroom doorway, dressed and washed now, a neat, clean young man in a white shirt and neatly knotted tie. \nCHARLIE I'll clean that up in a minute. \nHe disappears back into the bedroom. Helen picks up the ash tray and the cup and saucer. \nHELEN How late were you up last night? \nCHARLIE'S VOICE About two. \nINTERIOR. THE BEDROOM Charlie standing by the window, is picking up his keys, a few dollar bills, a comb, etc., from a chair and putting them into his trouser pockets. The blinds of the bedroom window have been opened, and the high August sun streams in, whitening Charlie's face. After he has pocketed his odds and ends, he moves to the chest of drawers on which, among all sorts of other things, there are several textbooks and an opened notebook. He stands a moment looking down into the open notebook, his lips moving ever so little, as he commits some of his notes to memory. He turns a page of the notebook back to check something and then goes back to the previous page. Now he opens one of the smaller drawers in the chest of drawers. The drawer contains wisps of his wife's stockings and other feminine things. He finds a small roll of bills and takes one of them, putting the bill in his pocket and closing the dresser drawer. \nCHARLIE I'm taking five bucks from your drawer. \nHe pauses now to affix a less frowning expression onto his face and goes out into the little foyer and into the dining area. \n", "test1_true": "CHARLIE A guy in my office is getting married, and I got clipped four bucks for his wedding present. \nHe begins assembling the mass of papers and textbooks on the table. \nHELEN Who's getting married? \nCHARLIE Arnold. I told you about him. The guy with the sick mother. \nHELEN Oh, yeah. \nCHARLIE (trying to decide whether he needs a certain worksheet) The rest of the guys are giving him a bachelor party tonight. \nHELEN Do you want to go, Charlie? \nCHARLIE I got class tonight. \nHELEN What have you got -- cost accounting? \nCHARLIE Yes. \nHELEN I think you ought to take off a night. You ought to go, have a little fun for yourself. I think you need that. You go to work all day, you go to school all night. You can miss one night, Charlie. \nCHARLIE No, these bachelor parties get kind of wild sometimes. The whole philosophy is: it's the groom's last night of freedom. So it gets kind of wild sometimes. \nHELEN That's a good philosophy to start a marriage with. \nCHARLIE Well, a bunch of guys get together, they like to tear up the town a little. \nHe has assembled his notes and notebooks and texts in a pile on the table, ready to take with him. He sits down and begins sipping his coffee. Helen looks back to her newspaper, frowning a little, then looks up at Charlie again. \nHELEN I think you oughta go, Charlie. I know you're upset about the baby. \nCHARLIE I'm not upset about the baby. \nHELEN Come on, Charlie. I know how you feel. Listen, you don't have to pretend you're excited about the baby. We weren't exactly planning on a baby right now ... \nCHARLIE I'm not upset about the baby. \nHELEN It's a shock. I had some bad days before I told you. I said: \"Oh, boy, that's all we need. A baby.\" Then I said to myself: \"If I'm having a baby, I'm having a baby. That's all there is to it.\" And I like the idea. We're going to have a family, Charlie. I like the idea. \nCHARLIE Well, give me a couple of days to get used to the idea. I'll be all right. \nHELEN I know you will, Charlie. That's why I think you ought to go to this bachelor party tonight. \nCHARLIE (bursting out) I don't want to go to this bachelor party. \nHe looks down at his coffee, embarrassed at the outburst. \nCHARLIE I'm sorry I yelled. \nHELEN Don't be silly. \n", "test1_id": 1239, "test2_input": "WALTER (after a moment) Life is short. \nThis gives everybody something to think about for a moment. \nEDDIE (hunched over the projector, dismantling it) You guys feel like going down to have a drink for Arnold? \nThis brings a reaction. Walter stands. \nWALTER Yeah! What do you say? One last drink for Arnold! \nCHARLIE Okay with me. \nSuddenly life is back in the room, the men ad-lib: \"Where's my coat?\" \"Let's get out of here,\" etc. \nKENNETH (unwinding himself from his slouched position on a chair) You can say what you want to about these pictures -- they're really pretty bad -- but they get you. \nARNOLD Don't you think we ought to clean up the place? \nEDDIE No, I got a woman comes in. \nWALTER (grabbing up his jacket) I almost fell asleep during the last one. (he looks at the others) Well, what do you say, huh? Let's go! One last drink! \nAd libs on exit. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINTERIOR. LIVING ROOM CHARLIE AND HELEN'S APARTMENT Helen and Julie. A corner lamp in the living room is lit, lending a soft but not too effective light to the room. The two young women are on the couch. Helen sits curled at one end, head down listening to Julie, who has been talking and probably crying a little since we last saw them forty-five minutes ago. Julie is seated with her legs stretched out in front of her, her head resting back on the back of the couch. She is talking more freely and easily now, the first hard outburst over with. \nJULIE ... He's a boy, my Mike. Till the day he dies, he'll never be more than fifteen. Perpetual adolescence, that's the curse of the professional man. He spends his whole youth trying to be a doctor, a lawyer, an accountant. Then he spends the rest of his life looking for the fun he should have had when he was a boy. \nHELEN Oh, I know. Charlie and I hardly even see each other. \nJULIE It's very hard on the wife, Helen. These are the years when you should be building your marriage. Instead, you grow away from each other. I've seen it happen with my friends. In the end, they have nice homes in New Rochelle, and a maid, and their maids are happier than they are. But sometimes it does work. It can be done, Helen. Encourage Charlie to stay with his school because... \nHELEN Oh, I will, Julie ... \nJULIE ... he's an ambitious boy ... \nHELEN ... oh, it's not just he's ambitious ... \nJULIE ... and if he doesn't fulfill himself, he'll resent you and your baby the rest of his life. \nHELEN Oh, I don't want him to quit. He loves accounting, Julie. I see him sometimes, sitting over his homework. He's got his ledgers out, and he's adding up columns of figures as long as his arm. And he's chuckling. You'd think he was reading the comics. He has a book there, Business Law. How he can read it I don't know. But I'll be watching television or something, and he'll come over, and he'll start telling me about some fine legal point. I don't know what he's talking about, but it's enough for me to see how excited it makes him. He loves it, Julie. You can't take something like that away from him. It's just -- it's just I feel we're not really close any more. I mean, he comes home from school, lots of times I'm asleep already. And, when I do see him, he seems all involved with himself. He looks at me sometimes as if I were a stranger to him, and I feel sometimes I am. I'm afraid of that, Julie. \nJULIE Then get rid of the baby. \nIt is said simply, inevitably, even innocently. It brings only a frown to Helen's face and a short silence. \nJULIE If I had it to do again, believe me, that's what I would do. \nHELEN (slowly becoming aware of the depth of what they are talking about) You don't mean that, Julie. \nJULIE Yes, I do. My children are the only things in my life now, but I would rather have a husband. \n", "test2_true": "JULIE That's what I said, too. \nHELEN Let's not even think about it. If I even mentioned it, he'd -- he'd hit me, I think. \nJULIE All right. \nNow, the thick, tense silence falls between them. They both occupy themselves with their own troubled thoughts. \nHELEN I want this baby, Julie. I've wanted this baby for a long time. It's the only thing I've ever asked of Charlie. If I mentioned that to him -- I don't know what he'd do. \nAgain, they sink into silence. Then in the thick silence, the telephone rings. The two young women are so deep within their thoughts that neither of them moves. It rings again, and Helen slides off the couch and goes to the phone. It rings again. She picks it up. \nHELEN (on phone) Hello.... Hello, Charlie, where are you calling from? ... You sound like you're having a nice time.... Oh, you're having a ball, huh? ... Well, what time do you think you'll be coming home? \nINTERIOR. PHONE BOOTH IN EIGHTH STREET BAR Charlie in the phone booth, smiling broadly. He seems in wonderful spirits. Through the glass of the phone booth we can see part of the bar and some of the barflies. \nCHARLIE (on phone) Well, that's what I wanted to call you about, honey. I think a couple of the guys are cutting out now. I think Kennie's going home. But I was wondering if you wanted me home for any special reason. \nINTERIOR. THE FOYER \nHELEN (on phone) Just a minute, Charlie.... \nShe rises, goes to kitchen door, still holding the phone. \nHELEN (to Julie) Excuse me a minute, Julie. It's Charlie.... \nShe goes into the kitchen. A little embarrassed, she closes the kitchen door. \nINTERIOR. THE KITCHEN \nHELEN (on phone) Charlie? ... (sits) Charlie, come on home now.... No, I feel all right. I just miss you. Julie's here, and we were talking about you, and I just miss you.... Ah, come on.... (frowns a little) Well, no, if you're having such a good time, stay out and enjoy yourself.... No, Charlie, I don't want you to come home if you're having a good time.... I'm not lonely. Julie's here. We're talking. I was washing some things.... I know, that's what I told you this morning. You've finally got a night off for yourself. I don't want you to feel guilty about it.... Charlie, do you love me? ... You sound angry.... No, come home any time you want.... (she wets her lips nervously) Charlie ... (she lets her head sink down onto the palm of her free hand) Charlie, there's no girls at this party, are there? ... I'm not checking up on you, Charlie. I just miss you, that's all.... All right, Charlie, please, I don't want to argue with you. Julie's in the living room. ... All right, have a good time, stay out as long as you want.... All right, Charlie, good- bye. \nShe slowly hangs up the receiver, sits slumped and abject. \nINTERIOR. PHONE BOOTH IN EIGHTH STREET BAR Charlie in booth. The broad grin has disappeared from his face. As seen through the closed glass doors of the booth, he is a very sullen and despondent young man. He stands now, pushes the doors open, and comes out. CAMERA PULLS BACK so that we can see the whole area of the bar near the phone booths. Next to the phone booth are two doors marked GUYS and DOLLS. Kenneth is coming in from the deeper recesses of the bar where the other members of the bachelor party are grouped in a booth. He is headed for the door marked GUYS. Charlie regards Kenneth bleakly as he approaches. \nCHARLIE The party breaking up? \nKENNETH (pushing into the men's room) I don't know. I'm going home. You going home? \nCHARLIE Yeah, I think so. \nHe pushes into the men's room after Kenneth. \nINTERIOR. THE MEN'S ROOM A small, white-tiled, yet somehow not too clean, men's room, two-urinal size. There is one washbowl with a small mirror over it, and two water closets with doors, separated from each other by a steel partition. Charlie perches on the edge of the washbowl; he apparently came in just to talk. Kenneth moves off camera for more practical use of the room. CAMERA stays on Charlie who seems depressed, pensive, sad. Stay on him for a long moment. Then ... \nCHARLIE (frowning) You love your wife, Kennie? \nKENNETH'S VOICE (off) Well, I've been married six years. I've got two kids that keep me awake all night long. Every Sunday, we go out driving in Long Island looking for a house that's going to take one, probably two mortgages. I better love my wife. \nKenneth appears now, edges Charlie away from the wash basin, so he can wash his hands. \n", "test2_id": 1240, "test3_input": "DISSOLVE TO: \nEXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT Our four amble along Washington Square North, headed west. In the background, the high apartment houses. It is about midnight now, and there are a number of people around, and there are lots of lights in the windows. There is still the feeling of life. However, some of the wind has gone out of our bachelor party since we last saw them carousing on Lexington Avenue. Now, of course, there are only four of them, and there is somewhat a feeling of straggling about them. \nEXTERIOR. STREET -- NIGHT The four men straggle along Tenth Street east of Seventh Avenue. This is a dark little street. Off at the intersection, you can see Seventh Avenue and an occasional car moving downtown, but West Tenth Street right now seems an empty, sleeping street of dark and old little apartment houses. The houses sometimes have little stoops. On one of the stoops, there is a woman sitting. She is in her thirties, not attractive nor unattractive. She wears a light summer frock, and she has one shoe off, and she is toying with the idea of pushing the other one off too. As the four men approach her, she looks up, half quizzically, half questioningly. The four men note her in passing and seem to continue on, but then come to a dragging halt about ten paces down. \nCLOSE GROUP SHOT OF THE FOUR MEN. \nEDDIE I think we've got one for you, Arnold. \nARNOLD One what? \nEddie looks back to the woman on the stoop. They all turn to look. Actually, Charlie has ambled a few paces even further down and doesn't know quite why they've stopped. They look at the woman; the woman looks at them a little warily. Rest of the scene from her point of view. \nARNOLD Ah, come on, Eddie. \nEDDIE She ain't bad. \nCHARLIE (calling from a few paces down) What's the matter? \nEDDIE We've got a live one. \nARNOLD (starting to walk) Come on, let's go. \nEDDIE Arnold, for Pete's sake. \nCHARLIE Ah, leave him alone! He doesn't want to. \nEDDIE Come on. We've been walking around all night here -- are you a man, or ain't you? \nArnold frowns. \nARNOLD All right, all right. \nWith a scowl, he assumes the responsibility of being a man. The four men, Charlie bringing up the rear, move down toward The Woman, who now looks down at her feet and begins wiggling her bare foot back into the unused shoe. \nTHE WOMAN (not looking up) I don't know who you fellows think I am, but you fellows have the wrong idea about me. \nEDDIE Yeah, I know. Arnold, see that bar down the corner. That's where we'll be. \nTHE WOMAN I'm afraid you fellows have the wrong idea about me. \nARNOLD She says we have the wrong idea. \nCHARLIE Ah, leave him alone. \nTHE WOMAN You fellows are working under a misconception. \nEddie and Walter have already started down the street to the bar. \nEDDIE We'll be in the bar, Arnold. \nCHARLIE You all right, Arnold? \n", "test3_true": "THE WOMAN Look, I'm just sitting here, fellows. Did I say anything? I was just sitting here. \nARNOLD You want to come with me, Charlie? \nCHARLIE No, Arnold. \nCharlie scowls at the suggestion, but there is something pleading in Arnold's face. \nCHARLIE You want me to? All right. I'll go up with you. \nEDDIE (from halfway down the street) Where you going, Charlie? \nCHARLIE I'll go up with him. Moral support. \nEDDIE What the---- we'll all go with you. \nCharlie waves him away. \nEDDIE (walks back to fellows) We'll be down at the bar. \nCharlie nods. Arnold looks briefly at The Woman and then away again. \nShe turns and goes up the steps into the building, her leather heels clicking on the stone steps. Arnold, head down, and Charlie, a little sheepishly, follow her. \nINTERIOR. THE HOUSE A dark, ill-lit hallway. A flight of stairs going up, wooden railings, worn carpeting. The Woman starts up the stairs, the two men following her. \nTHE WOMAN (as she goes) Ssshhh.... \nArnold, wetting his lips, nods. The Woman reaches the first landing. \nINTERIOR. LANDING The Woman has come around to one of the three doors on the landing and is inserting a key into a lock. Arnold and Charlie appear now at the head of the stairway. The Woman goes into her room, leaving the door open. A moment later, a shaft of light streams out into the landing. For a moment, nothing happens. Then Arnold and Charlie amble slowly down the landing to the open doorway and shaft of light. \nCHARLIE Hey, Arnold, you don't have to go through with this. \nARNOLD I think I should. \nCHARLIE I'll wait out here for you, okay? \nArnold nods and goes into the room. He closes the door. Charlie takes out a cigarette and lights it and inhales deeply. He feels a little sordid. There is the sound of steps, muffled by the carpeting, coming down the stairs. A man appears coming down from the floor above. He gives Charlie a quick look and continues on down the landing to the stairs and down again. Charlie scowls at the floor. He smokes his cigarette. \nINTERIOR. THE WOMAN'S ROOM It is a furnished room for which the woman pays eleven dollars a week. It is not particularly unkempt or tarty. There is a print slipcover on the soft chair and flowers on an end table. There is a studio couch with a neat spread and throw pillows on it. The Woman stands expressionlessly in front of the old chest of drawers. She has kicked off one shoe and she is now kicking off the other. She starts to say something: \nTHE WOMAN Listen, I don't want you to think I don't have a job. I got a job. I work. \nShe stops abruptly as Arnold, who is sitting, eyes averted, on a straight-back wooden chair, suddenly stands up and moves toward the door. \nTHE WOMAN What's the matter? \nArnold's lips open to form words, but nothing comes out, and he clamps his mouth tight and just stands, miserable and wretched. His hand makes a nervous, spasmodic, involuntary gesture, and he quickly clenches his fist. Beads of sweat are on his forehead. \nTHE WOMAN Are you afraid of me? \n", "test3_id": 1241}

BUTCH Hey, Phillip, check for a radio, too. 70   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                            70 Phillip, still in his skivvies, legs cut up and muddied from his escape from Jerry, sneaks up to the car and quietly peers into the open window. The keys dangle when his small hand touches them. Phillip closes the door, looks around and then runs pell-mell to the passenger window of the Impala. PHILLIP It's got keys and a radio.   I checked. BUTCH Good man. 
Phillip holds his crotch and stamps his feet. PHILLIP Can we stop at a fillin' station. BUTCH What for? PHILLIP Number one. BUTCH This here's nature, Phillip.   Pee in the ditch. Phillip scrambles to the ditch to relieve himself while Butch steps out of the Impala, tosses the keys into the field and walks toward the Ford. (CONTINUED) 
70   CONTINUED:                                                    70 The FARMER stops his tractor and notices Butch and Phillip. Phillip, despite his prior urgency, is having trouble coaxing relief. Butch slides into the Ford, pumps the gas pedal and turns the key. The ENGINE GRUMBLES and DIES. The Farmer is walking now, slowly and then at a trot as he realizes what's happening. Phillip finally starts to pee. Butch cranks again and again but the Ford is flooded. 
BUTCH Start, you sonofabitch! The Farmer runs faster, comes closer... FARMER Hey, that's my car! Hey!!! Butch floors the gas to clear the flood and the ENGINE finally STARTS. He throws it into reverse and peels out backwards into the road beside the ditch where Phillip continues to relieve himself. BUTCH Get in the car, Phillip! The Farmer, only 30 yards or so away, is racing toward them madder than a wet hen. Phillip tries to hurry but the RC continues to run through him. 
BUTCH Phillip!   Get in the car! Phillip pulls his underwear up and races to the car. He leaps into the open passenger door at the same moment Butch steps on the gas and the Farmer arrives and grabs onto the door as it closes. 71   INT. FORD - DAY                                               71 The CAR is SCREECHING down the road but the Farmer holds on for dear life and auto. He claws at Phillip, who does his best to fend off flailing hands and fingers. Butch reaches under the seat for and grasps the pistol. Phillip sees what's about to happen and bites the Farmer's hand as hard as he can. (CONTINUED) 
71   CONTINUED:                                                     71 FARMER Aaaaaayyyyyy!!!! The Farmer releases his grip on the door and falls backward, summersaulting into the adjacent ditch. Butch places the gun back under the seat. BUTCH Goddam, boy, how many RC's did you drink anyway? PHILLIP Four. 
Butch shakes his head and laughs. BUTCH One thing's for sure. You got one helluva set of chompers. 72   INT. TRUCK - DAY                                               72 Sitting still. Bradley tries to light a cigarette with the lighter but gets no heat. BRADLEY (to Suttle) Lighter don't work. Put that on the list. INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY Bobby Lee sits alone in the back corner of the main room of the RV. He just sits and stares, occasionally smiling cynically at Sally. 
Adler takes the latest info off the radio while the others listen in. ADLER (into radio) Highway 16 north. Four miles south of Desdemona. Got it. (to Red) Stole a vehicle. Kaiser radios up front, the ENGINE STARTS and the Airstream moves. RED (to Adler) What kinda' shape's it in? (CONTINUED)

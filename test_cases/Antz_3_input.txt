Z (pause) Well I'm gonna start doing things for you... 
WEAVER Will you introduce me to some worker girls? 
Z You bet!  They'll really go for a sensitive guy like you! 
WEAVER Maybe I'll get lucky. (Weaver thinks about it) You know, Z, I wouldn't do this for anyone but you... 
Weaver hands Z has helmet. 
WEAVER Wear this. 
Z (overjoyed) You're a real buddy. 
WEAVER (sourly) Yeah, I know. 
Z What do I do? 
WEAVER Don't tell anyone you're a worker. Follow that column over there.  And come right back after the inspection! 
Weaver points to a bunch of soldiers hurrying by in formation. 
Z (overjoyed) Thanks!  I owe you! 
Z skips off and joins the column, marching in time with the soldiers but too excited to keep from jazzing it up a little. 
INT. TOWN CENTER - NIGHT 
The ant army has gathered in a huge HALL in front of a reviewing stand.  We can hear the murmuring of thousands of soldiers -- but all we can see is a HUGE POSTER of an ant General pointing right at the camera.  The poster reads, "GENERAL FORMICA WANTS YOU -- to obey". 
Z turns to some of the soldiers near him. 
Z Any of you guys know when the Princess will show up?  She's kind of a personal friend. 
The soldiers look at Z like he's nuts. 
LOUD VOICE ATTEN-SHUN! 
MARTIAL MUSIC sounds, and we hear thousands of ant feet as they snap to attention.  Z imitates the soldiers awkwardly. 
GENERAL FORMICA struts to the middle 6f the screen, slapping his thigh with a swagger stick (the antenna of some unfortunate insect) 
FORMICA First of all, let me make one thing clear.  Nobody ever won a battle by thinking for himself.  All this "thinking" stuff is a load of crap. If the almighty had wanted you boys to think, he wouldn't have given you huge mandibles and a brain so small you'd misplace it if it wasn't trapped inside your head. 
In the audience, Z starts laughing -- he thinks Formica's just made a joke. 
Z (slapping his thigh) "Trapped inside your head" -- that's a good one -- 
Z notices nobody else is laughing.  He stops. 
Z Geez -- tough room. 
From the stage, Formica is squinting at the audience, trying to make out who was laughing, but there are just too many ants.  He continues. 
FORMICA (striding back and forth) We ants survive as a species because we do what we're told.  We survive because we work together, as one, we get the job done, we do whatever it takes to persevere! (dramatic pause) Hell, we're not an army of ants...we're one giant ant, with giant fists, and giant jaws! 
The soldiers CHEER!  Z CHEERS along with the rest of them.

DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.) Not that.  The White House just announced that it was sponsoring legislation that would, in one stroke, void all remaining elements of the 1948 Combat Exclusion Laws. 
The phone suddenly weights a ton, DeHaven dumps it on the seat beside her.  HOLD on her disbelieving face. 
DEHAVEN'S AIDE (V.O.) You there?  Senator? 
INT.  CORRIDOR - PENTAGON - DAY 
Hand-carrying a report, Flag Officer #1 hurries down a corridor, pushes through a door.  HOLD on the door marker: "Secretary of the Navy." 
INT.  SECNAV OFFICE - PENTAGON - DAY 
HAYES Without telling us they do this? With absolutely no lead time? 
At his desk, Hayes scans the report with a deepening frown. 
FLAG OFFICER #1 (to Hayes) Mr. Secretary, if this bill passes... 
FLAG OFFICER #2 Forget our three-year plan.  They're rushing the cadence.  We'll be forced to reorganize the Navy from top to bottom -- overnight. 
HAYES What the hell is the President trying to do?  Steal DeHaven's thunder? 
FLAG OFFICER #1 I think it's more important, sir, to decide what we're going to do -- since it's apparent this issue is not going away quietly. 
HAYES "G.I. Jane."  And which one of you told me she wouldn't last a week? Huh? 
The flags squirm.  Shaking his head, Hayes moves to a window that offers a stunning view of Arlington National Cemetery. 
HAYES 20 years in the Pentagon, I finally rate an office with a window -- and it looks out over the world's largest graveyard.  Think it's a sign? 
EXT.  GRINDER - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
The bell.  It reflects the moon.  TILT DOWN to reveal a new batch of helmets -- the casualties of S.E.R.E.  A graveyard of its own. 
EXT.  THE EXCHANGE - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - NIGHT 
Jordan exits with purchases.  Her face is still bruised from S.E.R.E.  With a minute to kill, she peruses a bulletin board casually.  But a RAISED VOICE leads her eyes to... 
Wickwire.  At a phone kiosk, he hangs up emphatically.  He looks flustered when he spots Jordan. 
JORDAN Sorry, didn't mean to -- 
WICKWIRE That's okay.  Just an ex-girlfriend. And know I remember why. 
JORDAN First big night of liberty and no date?  You're pathetic, Wickwire. 
WICKWIRE Maybe I'll just head over to McP's with the others, have a drink or four.  Don't wanna come, do you? 
JORDAN (touching bruises) I can't go out.  Not like this. 
WICKWIRE I think you look beautiful. 
JORDAN Thanks for lying.  But you're the class officer, Wick, and it'd just be weird if we hook up.  Besides... 
Catching up, Blondell exits the exchange. 
BLONDELL Sorry.  Forgot I needed oregano and... 
She sees Wickwire.  An awkward beat for them all. 
JORDAN Do you, uh, know... 
WICKWIRE Sure, sure. 
JORDAN We're going over to her place to make salad and pasta.  Just, you know, nothing special. 
WICKWIRE Okay.  Well... thought I'd ask. 
Jordan and Blondell head for the parking lot.  HOLD on Wickwire, looking after them.  Thinking it through. 
INT.  CLASSROOM - CORONADO NAVAL BASE - DAY 
Charts are being passed around the room.  Every trainee takes one, including Jordan. 
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS ... underwater detonation devices employ mechanical timers, and as such, they are subject to variances due to water temperature.  That's why when clearing mines, we always use two timers.  The charts now being passed out contain calculations you must memorize before... 
A MILITARY COP fills the classroom doorway.  Frowning, Johns joins the cop for a private discussion. 
INSTRUCTOR JOHNS O'Neil?

MATER Don't sweat it. These things happen to everybody, Otis. 
OTIS But you never leak oil. 
MATER Yeah, but I ain't perfect. Don't tell nobody, but I think my rust is starting to show through. 
Mater and Otis drive past THE RADIATOR SPRINGS WELCOME SIGN. It has been amended to say: "Home of Lightning McQueen." 
OTIS Hey, is Lightning McQueen back yet? 
MATER Not yet. 
OTIS He must be crazy-excited about winning his fourth Piston Cup. Four! Wow! 
MATER Yeah, we're so dadgum proud of him. But I sure wish he'd hurry up and get back `cause we got a whole summer's worth of best friend fun to make up for. Just me and -- 
Ahead of them, a half-mile off, a RED RACE CAR is visible. 
MATER --- McQueen! 
Mater FLOORS IT, dragging poor Otis behind him. 
OTIS Uh, Mater? I'm in no hurry. You don't need to go so fast! 
Boom! They hit a bump. Otis catches air. 
EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - DAY 
Lightning McQueen is surrounded by his hometown friends. 
LUIGI Oh, Lightning. Welcome home. 
FLO Good to have you back, honey. 
FILLMORE Congratulations, man. 
SARGE Welcome home, soldier. 
SHERIFF The place wasn't the same without you, son. 
LIZZIE What? Did he go somewhere? 
MCQUEEN It's good to be home, everybody. 
MATER (O.S.) McQueen! 
They all turn around, see Mater speeding into town, with Otis swerving behind him. 
MCQUEEN Mater! 
MATER McQueen! 
Mater skids into main street and in one swift motion, slingshots Otis forward --- 
OTIS Woaahhhhh! 
--- right through Ramone's front door --- 
INT. RAMONE'S - CONTINUOUS 
--- where he lands perfectly on the hydraulic lift. Ramone lifts him up, routine. 
RAMONE Hey. How far'd you make it this time, Otis? 
OTIS Halfway to the county line. 
RAMONE Not bad, man. 
OTIS I know, I can't believe it either! 
EXT. RADIATOR SPRINGS - CONTINUOUS 
MATER McQueen, welcome back! 
MCQUEEN Mater, it's so good to see you. 
MATER You too, buddy. 
Mater and McQueen do an ELABORATE TIRE BUMP (fist bump style). 
MATER Oh, man. You ain't gonna believe the things I got planned for us. 
Everyone watches as the tire bump continues. 
MACK (to Lizzie, an aside) These best friend greetings get longer every year. 
MATER (TO MCQUEEN) You ready to have some serious fun? 
MCQUEEN Well, actually I've got something to show you first. 
INT. RADIATOR SPRINGS MUSEUM - DAY 
CLOSE ON THE PISTON CUP. It has now changed, been adorned with a small likeness of Doc. It says "Hudson Hornet Piston Cup." 
MATER Wow. I can't believe they renamed the Piston Cup after our very own Doc Hudson. 
McQueen and Mater are alone, the museum closed to the public. McQueen approaches a "Hudson Hornet" wall with Doc's three Piston cups, framed articles, other racing ephemera. 
MCQUEEN I know Doc said these things were just old cups, but to have someone else win it just didn't feel right, you know? 
MATER Well, Doc would've been real proud of you. That's for sure. 
McQueen takes this in.

Cheese, very casually, takes a HANDGUN from out of his waistband. He examines it. 
PATRICK (CONT'D) Yo, yo, what is this? 
CHEESE First of all, don't never come up in my spot like that. You got my money? You can leave that shit in the mailbox on you ass way out. Feel me? Some other motherfuckers let fools rob on 'em. I don't play scrimmage-- but I don't fuck with no kids-- Something occurs to Cheese. 
CHEESE (CONT' D) Hold up. Cheese indicates Patrick's shirt with his pistol. 
CHEESE (CONT' D) Lift up yo shirt. 
(BEAT) What? You thought we was cool? I ain't down with you. Don't l e t me see a wire . . . 
A little taken aback, Patrick lifts his shirt up. 
CHEESE (CONT'D) 
(TO ANGIE) You, too, baby. Show me them tetons. 
From behind, we see her lift her shirt, exposing her bra. Cheese seems satisfied. 
He takes another whack at the pipe. 
CHEESE (CONT' D) I know one "McCready." Kept a bitch in my stable by that name. No titties, fucked up shit goin' on with the face-- But you give her the right shit she get freaky. Bounce up and down on yo shit. Pop! Pop! Go t h e w e a s e l . 
He goes back for the pipe, seems to lose his concentration. Patrick unsnaps his holster, subtly. 
PATRICK If you point a gun at her again I'm gonna pull your fuckin' card, okay? 
(BEAT) You' re saying you didn't do it? Okay. What other choice do I have? We'll take your money and go along our way. 
(BEAT) But If I find out you' re lying, I'll spend every nickel of your money dedicated to fuckin' you up. I'll bribe cops to go after you, I'll pays guys to go after your crew, I'll tell everyone I know that you're a C.I. and a rat -- and I know a lot of people. Cheese. After that, you're gonna wished you had listened to me. 
(MORE) 
PATRICK (CONT'D) 'Cause your shitty pool-hall crime syndicate headquarters will be raided, your doped up bitches will get sent back to Laos and this dumb mutherfucker 
(RE: CHRIS) will be testifying against you for a reduced sentence while you end up in a cell with a big motherfucker, his dick and your Zippo 'cause from what I heard, guys who kill kids aren't treated too good in Concord. But maybe I'm wrong. Maybe things are different these days. 
CHEESE Don't never speak to me that way. 
(HE SMILES) You ain't shit. Yo bitch ain't shit. Neither one of y'all motherfuckers is shit. Fuck both ya' 11. If you didn't have two pig out in my meadow--! put a round in both your heads right now. 
Cheese's eyes narrow, his pupils like black pinpricks in his irises. 
CHEESE (CONT' D) And if that girl only hope is you. I pray for her. She is gone, baby. Gone. 
He laughs. 
CHEESE (CONT' D) Out. And if I see you on the street, I'm a get discourteous on you. 
They get up. 
CHEESE (CONT'D) And get this sausage off my lawn. 
He indicates Poole and Bressant who can be see through the window, smoking on a small patch of dirt outside the apartment. 
EXT. CHEESE'S APARTMENT, SHAWMUT AVE. ROXBURY - MOMENTS LATER52 
Patrick and Anqie approach Poole and Bressant. Patrick shakes his head. 
POOLE What happened? 
ANGIE He said he didn't know anything but if we had his money we could leave it in the mailbox. 
BRESSANT Is that what he told you? 
PATRICK Yeah, that's it. 
POOLE He said nothing else? 
PATRICK He wants you off his fuckin' lawn. 
POOLE I thought you knew the guy. 
BRESSANT Half the guys he grew up with are degenerates. 
PATRICK You know what the other half are? 
BRESSANT What? 
PATRICK Cops. But don't hold it against me. 
BRESSANT Nah. You know what I hold against you? We had one chance to make this deal. You said you knew him, you said you could do it and you fucked it up. Now we have to get a warrant for a tap, start surveillance and hope to Christ we get lucky. If that costs Amanda her life, I won't have to hold it against you. You'll hold it against yourself for a good, long time. 
ANGIE'S APT - NIGHT 
INT PATRICK   & 
Patrick and Angie in their bedroom. It's late and they can't sleep. A LOCAL NEWS REPEAT runs on the television woven into their dialogue. In effect, it will play like background. 
ANGIE Look, the Police taking over isn't necessarily a bad thing. 
PATRICK No? 
ANGIE They see more child exploitation in a week than we could in a career...

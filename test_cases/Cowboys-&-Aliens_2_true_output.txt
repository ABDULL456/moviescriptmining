A SPEEDER IS ROARING TOWARD THEM BOUNCING OVER DESERT: 
DOLARHYDE (squints, realizing...) Jesus... it's the kid. As Emmett ROARS IN, the shocked outlaws SCATTER: 
EMMETT 
THEY'RE COMING!!!! THEY'RE COMING!!! The kid TUMBLES off the speeder as it PLOWS RIGHT THROUGH CAMP, kicking up DIRT and UPENDING SUPPLIES. As Emmett scrambles up -- 
VROOOM! FOUR MORE SPEEDERS ROAR OVER THE CREST IN PURSUIT OF 
EMMETT! THE ALIENS FROM THE CAVE! 
JAKE 
EVERYBODY MOOOOVE!!! 
STEEL COLLARS START FLYING, ATTACHED TO ROPING CABLES -- BEFORE 
THE GANG KNOWS WHAT'S HAPPENING, THEY'RE BEING GRABBED AND 
DRAGGED AWAY! Those who have their wits about them FIRE BACK, trying to hit the flying machines. CROSSFIRE. CONFUSION. 
THE SLAVER His speeder GROWLS to a halt. Dismounting like a killer biker. ON JAKE. As he SEES that horrible alien face across the crowd: QUICK BIT: Alice dying in his arms. And this same damn THING is the one responsible for it. And we're: BACK TO PRESENT. Jake's eyes LOCKED on the SLAVER as he says: 
JAKE (CONT'D) You. 
BUT THE ACTION COMES ROARING BACK AS: Outlaws start FIRING at the Slaver, who REACTS in mere annoyance. Flicks open a POUCH on his bandolier for what look like THUMB TACKS -- throws them and they tan out, PIERCING THE NECKS of the outlaws, activating "Blue": !NTLY E ZE. TUR an The Slaver draws a ROL) that TELESCOPES into a SIX FOOT LANCE -- KA-TCHING! BARBED ENDS snap out and the alien runs on two limbs, then FOUR -- LEOPARD-LIKE for speed -- rises back up and SMASH! SHATTERS each man into a million Pieces. Now he uses the bladed-ends to SKEWER five more outlaws and turns -- 
MEETING JAKE'S EYES IN MUTUAL RECOGNITION -- SCREECHES: 
JAKE (CONT'D) 
(TO DOLARHYDE) Find cover!!! Jake FIRES his pulse blaster, providing cover as DOLAR, DOC, EMMETT, and ELLA rush to hide behind the WAGON. The Aliens FIRE BACK as LASER CROSSFIRE shreds the camp -- EXPLOSIONS and CHAOS: THREE OUTLAWS scramble to form a GATLING CREW. It SPINS to life, MOWING DOWN tents as they try to hit the aliens -- 
ANOTHER ALIEN Hurls a boomerang-like "SMART WEAPON." It circles past the GATLING COWBOYS, BACK into the alien's hand as: 
THE TOP HALVES OFTHE_COWBOYS SLIDE OFF, SEVERED AT THE WAIST,'. An EXPLOSION blows one of whiskey crates open on the wagon: 
EMMETT 
USE THE WHISKEY! IT BURNS EM! 
ELLA 
-- WHAT?! 
EMMETT 
LIKE ACID ON THEIR SKIN!!! Ella REACTS -- WHAT? As an alien SKITTERS toward her, she grabs a bottle and HURLS IT -- it EXPLODES all over the creature! A HORRIBLE SCREECH as its skin smokes, thrashing epileptically -- 
ELLA 
(REVELATION) Oh my GOD -- 
DOLARHYDE 
LET'S GO!!! Our people ESCAPE for the horses. Doc climbs up on the WAGON buckboard and pulls EMMETT in the seat beside him -- As ELLA leaps on a horse -- 
THE SLAVER Climbs back on his speeder and GUNS FOR HER, firing a STEEL COLLAR -- Jake turns -- SEES THIS. Starts RUNNING MADLY: 
JAKE 
ELLA!!

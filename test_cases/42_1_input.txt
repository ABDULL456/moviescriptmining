YELLOW REV 4-24-12 31. The MAN on first takes a lead. 
RICKEY To treat him as they would any other teammate. 
HOPPER Uh huh. 
RICKEY To be natural, to impose no restrictions on themselves. To all work together in harmony. WHACK! The hit & run is on. The man on first runs on the pitch as a LOW LINE DRIVE shoots for the gap between 1st and 2nd. Robinson turns himself inside out to dive on his belly and catch it before it hits the ground. He spins himself around, pivots on a knee to throw the runner out before he can get back to first. Â  Rickey is astounded. 
RICKEY That was superhuman. 
HOPPER 
(CHUCKLING) Superhuman? Don't get carried away, Mr. Rickey, that's still a Nigger out there. Rickey takes a moment to process. It's Hopper's light admonishing tone that really halts him. Finally... 
RICKEY Clay, I realize that attitude is part of your heritage; that you practically nursed race prejudice at your mother's breast, so I will let it pass. But I will add this: you can manage Robinson fairly and correctly or you can be unemployed. They both look over as Jack comes off the field toward them. 
HOPPER Attaboy, Jackie! Way to turn two! 
CUT TO: 
40 EXT. FRONT PORCH - THE BROCK HOUSE - SANFORD - NIGHT 40 
Smith and Mr. Brock are sitting on the porch sipping rum and cokes. A quiet evening. 
DBL. BLUE REV 7-9-12 32. 
MR. BROCK I hope Jackie sleeps alright. Chasing baseballs in the sun all day, I'd be in my grave. How are they treating him out there? They watch as a CAR slows, parks across the street. 
SMITH Okay as far as I can see. A MIDDLE-AGED WHITE MAN, LUTHER exits the car and starts toward them. 
MR. BROCK 
(FROWNS) You find good people every place you go. Even here in Florida... 
LUTHER 
(STOPPING BELOW) Is he in there? 
SMITH Who is it you're looking for? 
LUTHER Nigra ball player. The air suddenly alive with danger. 
SMITH He's asleep. Maybe you better come back in the morning. 
LUTHER I ain't comin' back. Other fellas is comin'. They ain't too happy about him stayin' here in Sanford. Playin' ball with white boys. (a long beat) Skedaddle, that's what I'd do. If'n they get here, and he's still here, there's gonna be trouble. He turns and walks away. As they watch, a phone rings... 
RICKEY'S VOICE Yes, Wendell, what is it? 
CUT TO: 
41 INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAYTONA BEACH - NIGHT 41 
Rickey in his pajamas in his hotel room. On the phone. 
YELLOW REV 4-24-12 33. 
RICKEY I see... Yes, I understand. Wake him up and get him out of there. Put him in the car and start driving for Daytona Beach. Now. And, Wendell, under no circumstance tell him what this is about. I do not want him to get it in his head to stay there and fight. 
CUT TO: 
42 INT. BEDROOM - MR. BROCK'S HOUSE - NIGHT 42 
Half dressed, Jack sits on the edge of his bed, feeling bad. Through his open door, across a hall, we can see Smith in his room. Passing in and out of view packing his own things. 
JACK I was just getting loose. Smith sticks his head in the door. 
SMITH Don't just sit there. Pack your duds. We're blowin'. A phone RINGS somewhere. They hear Brock answer, then: 
MR. BROCK'S VOICE Wendell?! Smith leaves the room. Hold on Jack, despair as he listens. 
SMITH'S VOICE Yes, Mr. Rickey, I'm with him now... We're pulling out for Daytona in five minutes, soon as he gets his bag packed... Yes, yes, it's just one of those things. âOne of those things.' As Jack's head hangs a little lower. 
CUT TO: 
43 INT./EXT. BUICK - MAIN STREET - SANFORD - NIGHT 43 
The street deserted, sidewalks rolled up. Jack angry and silent in the passenger seat. Smith jumpy behind the wheel. They stop as a PICK-UP stops ahead outside a BAR where: A DOZEN WHITE MEN in shirtsleeves exchange words with the boys in the truck. To Jack it looks like a typical small town bull session. To Smith it looks like something else. 
GOLDENROD REV 5-9-12 34. The white men look over at the two black men. One steps over, motions: roll down the window. 
JACK I wonder what he wants? 
SMITH To run us out of town. 
JACK What are you talking about? The man close now. As Jack cranks down the window, Smith floors it. The Buick SCREECHES away, SWERVING around a CAR coming the other way. 
JACK What the hell, Wendell?!

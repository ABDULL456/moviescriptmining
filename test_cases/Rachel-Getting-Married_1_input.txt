SIDNEY Dear God, bless this family and let them always invite us for dinner because my new wife can't boil water or fry an egg. La Chaim. 
EVERYONE La Chaim. Rachel suddenly stands on a chair and bangs on a glass with a spoon. 
RACHEL Friends and family, family and friends! I have an announcement to make! I'm the bride and I'm knocked up! Surprised whooping and hollering. 
RACHEL I'm exercising my bridely, knocked up prerogatives and demand that 
everybody starts dancing. And this means you too, Mom! Abby smiles. SFX: The Deejay spins an infectious platter (TBD). 
RACHEL Oh yay! Dad c'mon. C'mon Dad! This is my favorite song! 
PAUL Ooo. Look at me, I'm dancing. She drags Paul to the temporary poolside patio dance floor. Paul is a fantastic dancer! Sidney drags his dad to the dance floor. He's dramatic and weird! Abby smiles politely at Kym and goes to sit down with Andrew. Kieran spirits Kym to the patio, where they join the dancers.

THE RECEIVING LINE -- All members of both families are lined 
up outside the entrance to the tent to greet the INNER CIRCLE GANG and the LUCKY FEW OUTSIDERS who have been invited to this evening's gala wedding reception party. It is twilight.

Everybody is spruced and rested. Rachel and Sidney have changed into awesome party outfits. 
Inside the tent, yet another group of musician friends are currently laying down an evocative, hypnotic and extremely cool, jazzy "world music" groove as the same attractive and immaculate young servers (from the rehearsal dinner) circulate with trays of delicious appetizers, wine, seltzer, etc. 
Kym is still wearing her sari. She stands next to her mother. They are doing their wedding party duties. Neither woman is looking at the other. 
BOB THE NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR (to Abby indicating Kym) And how is our little wayward girl? 
KYM Fine. (Beat.) I had an accident. 
ABBY And, how are you, Bob? 
BOB God, never better -- Isaac opened his practice! 
QUICK CUTS OF KYM 
NICE FAMILY FRIEND We're all so glad you made it! I shouldn't be telling you this, but there was actually a pool! Is that hysterical? 
DISTINGUISHED NEIGHBOR (eyeing Kym's injuries with a twinkle) If you're in need of any legal services... 
AWKWARD YOUNG GUEST I don't know if you remember this but you owe me $750. 
HIP YOUNG GUEST Are you holding?

INTERESTING YOUNG WOMAN Kym! Angela Paylin!! 
Angela sports an intense tattooed image on the inside of her right forearm. Her face features a unique piercing. Kym hugs her. Their reunion makes her cry...Angela is nice.

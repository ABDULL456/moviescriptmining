CLIVE Thank you. He mops his nose as they leave the RV. GRAHAM lingers. 
GRAHAM You can sleep in my bunk if you'd like. She smiles at him. He goes to leave but turns back. 
GRAHAM I'd use a pen to push the tissues off the bed. I've had a cold. 
EXT. DESERTED TOWN - NIGHT 
GRAHAM and PAUL stand outside a liquor store on the main drag of a quiet town. Next door is a Western themed clothing store. PAUL looks in the window. 
PAUL Hey Graham. Check this out. What d'ya think? PAUL indicates to a small cowboy outfit, big enough for a child, displayed in the window. 
PAUL I'd look pretty hot, right? 
GRAHAM Space cowboy. 
PAUL Steve Miller Band. I love that song. Speaking of midnight tokers, I got a littler herbal refreshment in my pants. Do you guys partake? 
GRAHAM No. 
PAUL Shame. I get it from the military. This is the shit that killed Dylan. 
GRAHAM Bob Dylan's still alive. 
PAUL Is he? CLIVE comes out of the liquor store clutching bags of beer. 
CLIVE Let's party! 
EXT. WOODS - NIGHT 
GRAHAM, CLIVE and PAUL have made a camp fire in a woodland clearing on the other side of town. They sit round drinking beers and chatting. PAUL rolls a joint. 
GRAHAM So why "Paul'? It's not very, you know, alien. 
CLIVE Is it spelt like, P-'-a-w-l-l or something? 
PAUL No. 
GRAHAM P-o-o-u-r-l? 
PAUL No, it's Paul. Like Paul Newman or the little guy from Simon and Garfunkel. 
CLIVE Paul Simon. 
PAUL Paul Simon. Paul's not my real name. It's a name I got given. 
GRAHAM What's your real name? 
PAUL You won't be able to pronounce it. 
CLIVE I can speak Klingon. 
PAUL What a geek. 
CLIVE Hey! 
GRAHAM Come on, what's your real name. PAUL opens his mouth and screeches. 
PAUL Roooooootttchaaaaaaaaaaa. 
CLIVE Roooooootttttttccchhaaaa. 
PAUL That's pretty good. 
GRAHAM Rootchaa? That sounds like Roger. 
PAUL Fuck you! 
CLIVE Calm down, Rog. More laughter. Even PAUL. He lights his joint. 
GRAHAM You look like a poster on a student's wall. 
PAUL That was my gag! "Take me to your dealer' right? Yeah, that was mine. Never saw a dime. 
GRAHAM You never answered my question. Why Paul? Who called you Paul? 
PAUL The little girl who found me when I crashed. It was terrible actually. I killed her dog. I didn't mean to! My ship sort of landed on it. When the military arrived I was delirious; I kept saying "Paul? Paul?" It was the only English I knew, because I'd heard the little girl saying it over and over. Spooks thought it was my name. 
CLIVE She called her dog Paul? 
PAUL Least it wasn't Mr. Muggles. 
GRAHAM What happened to the little girl?

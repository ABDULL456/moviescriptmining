LENNY I thought we were friends. 
MACE No, see a friend is more than one person constantly doing favors for another.  You just suck people along with your schemes and your scams and your slick act.  Well I'm out.  I got a kid, I got rent, I got an ex- husband someplace who doesn't send me a dime of support... I'm just trying to hold on here. 
LENNY So am I.  Just trying to get by. 
MACE No, you're just trying to get off. 
LENNY Macey... I've never seen you like this. 
MACE Lenny, you're turning into some kinda squid-head low-life.  You're always broke, you just go from one score to the next.  And you're getting strung out... you don't even see it.  Getting high on your own supply like some crack dealer. 
LENNY I know you wouldn't be saying all this if you didn't care about me. Thanks, Mace.  Really. 
MACE Look, I gotta get some sleep. 
LENNY You still like me, don't you?  We're still buddies? 
She hates it that she can't resist his pathetic charm. 
MACE (a tiny smile) Yeah.  I don't see a way out of it. 
LENNY Macey, I know you're tired, but can you drop me at the Retinal Fetish? It's on your way. 
MACE Jesus, Lenny. 
LENNY Begging?  Groveling?  Any pathetic behavior at all?  Will that help? Faith's there tonight, and I've got to talk to her. 
MACE Sure, Lenny. (she puts the car in gear) The only thing worse than a junkie is someone in love. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  RETINAL FETISH - NIGHT 
As Mace pulls to a stop in the parking lot and Lenny opens the door. 
LENNY Come on, let me buy you a drink. Let's drink and make up. (Mace shakes her head) Alright, I'm going to see Faith. That means you can watch me suffer. I'll be in agony, you'll feel so much better.  Total and thorough payback, whatdya say? 
Mace smiles, shaking her head in wonder at this madman. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  RETINAL FETISH 
Mace accompanies Lenny into the pounding din of the Retinal Fetish.  The place is a fringe hangout, a converted schmata factory transformed into a warren of dark rooms and corridors off the main dance floor.  A thundering labyrinth.  Steel cage-like partitions of chain-link give the place a harsh, concentration-camp atmosphere.  The music is a bass tech-thump, and the clientele are young and on the rough side.  Cybergrunge. 
There are many large video screens running a continuous montage of wild graphics and images... a flurry of disturbing videos: MTV baptized by William Burroughs. 
The Fetish is a street-tech hangout, a meeting place for a lot of digital-underground types that Lenny knows.  You can buy and sell what you want here: illicit hardware and software, as well as chemicals for the wetware (brain). 
Lenny and Mace are greeted inside by two suited guys with metal detectors.  They barely notice as they are scanned: it's routine there days.  Mace shows her gun, a Sig Saur 9mm, and her state carry-permit.  The security guys check her pistol like a coat, giving her a claim check. 
Through the crowd in the lounge Lenny's eyes go immediately to one table.  It seems to be in a pool of light all it's own; or maybe this is just in Lenny's mind. SLOW MOTION: Lenny watches a man at the table holding court, with a beautiful young woman sitting next to him. 
It is TRAN VO.  He's a mover and shaker in the record business: he produces, he manages, he tries to keep everyone in his orbit. 
The woman is FAITH JUSTIN.  We recognize her from playback as Lenny's ex-girlfriend.  But now her hair has been dyed jet black and frames her face in a wild tangle.  She is wearing as expensive custom leather jacket over a sheer silk top.  She has on too much make-up, which gives her features a feral-doll quality.  Faith looks like what she is, a rock star wannabe.  But the look is red-hot. 
Tran looks around the room.  His eyes miss nothing.  And show nothing.  His hand -- unhurried, graceful, remarkable -- brushes past Faith's cheek, barely touching her.  His fingers pick up a strand of hair, tuck it like a treasure behind her ear... fingers touching her head now... a moment of suspended time. 
... and she trembles.  Just a little.  For a second. 
Tran and Faith are flanked on either side by an entourage consisting of music types, various hangers on, and Tran's personal security force of four: JOEY CORTO, a whippet- thin skinhead; DUNCAN, a none-too-bright armbreaker in the classic mold; a massively built ex-jock type called WADE BEEMER; and a sixteen year old Asian stone fox, CINDY MINH, aka 'VITA', possibly the most lethal of the four. 
LENNY Who's the new side of beef in Tran's posse? 
MACE Guy named Wade Beemer.  Used to be a running back for the Rams in '96 and 
LENNY Rams... that's football, right? 
He can't take his eyes off Faith.  Mace scowls at the tableau and pulls Lenny toward the bar. 
MACE Forget her. 
LENNY She still loves me. 
MACE She thinks you're a bucket of dog vomit.  Trust me on this. 
LENNY She's my destiny. 
MACE Destiny?  You living in a perfume commercial?  She's a hard-climber that dropped you like a used tampon when she got a better ride. 
LENNY You'll see. 
Mace gives up, shakes her head and Lenny plunges into the crowd... toward Faith.  Several patrons greet him, just as in the Coral Lounge, but uncharacteristically, Lenny virtually ignores them. 
Approaching the main table now.  Ringside.  Tran sees him; no reaction.  Now Faith sees him: her reaction's a little tougher to read.  Pissed off, maybe, or just tense. 
Tran's security force has seen Lenny coming.  But they stay casual.

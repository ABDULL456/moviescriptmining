They're here. \nOn Nelle and Truman, surprised. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nA FOOTBALL GAME plays on the television. No one's watching. We can HEAR Alvin on the phone in his study at the back of the house. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nTruman and Marie at the stove. Nelle sits at the kitchen table. Truman has his jacket off and an apron on, as does Marie. They are peering into a POT OF BLACK-EYED PEAS. Marie is shaking in drops of HOT PEPPER TABASCO. \nTRUMAN More. More. \nMARIE Alvin will hate this. \nTRUMAN Yes, but we who know the truth will love it. \nMARIE (laughs) I have to stop. (then) I cannot believe you're from New Orleans. I miss it so much. \nTRUMAN I only lived there for a short while but my Mama was born and bred. \nMARIE You know something -- Alvin pretends he doesn't know who you are, but the minute you came to town he read your books. He had one of his men pick up \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" in Kansas City 'cause it's banned from the library here. \nTRUMAN What did Mr. Dewey think? \nMARIE He liked it more than he's willing to admit. \nTRUMAN How very foxy. \nMarie smiles at that word used to describe her husband. \nTRUMAN Mama would've put in half the bottle by now. \nBeat. \nMARIE Alright, one more shake. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nAlvin walks toward the kitchen. He smokes. He looks exhausted. He hears SQUEALS of laughter. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nAlvin enters. They all stop laughing and look at him. nods to Truman and Nelle. \nTRUMAN Hello. \nNELLE Hi. \nSilence. Marie sips her drink. \nMARIE How you doing, foxy? \nShe cracks up. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, DINING ROOM - LATER \nThe remains of dinner. The kids have left. The bottle of J&B sits on the table, half-empty. Marie's a bit drunk. Everyone's PLATE is clean except for Alvin's, on which sits a MOUND of uneaten black-eyed peas. Truman is mid-story. \nTRUMAN I was writing the script as they were filming, all that time in Italy. I'd work like mad all day long and then dash down to the bar around midnight to hand in the next day's scenes. Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar -- \nMARIE (whispers to Alvin) Humphrey Bogart. \nAlvin knows. \nTRUMAN -- where he and John drank every night -- \nMARIE (to Alvin) John Huston. \nAlvin knows. \nTRUMAN -- and I mean drank, like famished water buffaloes. Well -- I'd only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me I had a phone call. It was my stepfather, Joe Capote, calling to say that my mother had died. I flew home to New York -- terribly distraught -- but when I got to the apartment I could see that Joe was in even worse shape than I was. He grabbed my hands and sat me down at the kitchen table, and he said to me, \"Talk. Talk about anything, any subject in the world. Don't worry whether it will interest me or not. Just talk so I won't break down.\" And I did. He couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts. It was too painful. \nIt's quiet for a moment, then Marie looks at Alvin. \n", "test1_true": "DEWEY Marie -- \nMARIE Oh come on, Alvin. These are good people. \nFinally, Dewey looks at Truman and Nelle. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, STUDY - NIGHT \nAlvin shows Truman and Nelle the CRIME SCENE PHOTOS from the Clutter murders. We see the four corpses, BOUND and SHOT, the bloody footprints in the Clutter basement. Truman and Nelle stare at the photos of Nancy and Kenyon. Then, quietly -- \nTRUMAN Who would put a pillow under the boy's head just to shoot him? Why would they tuck Nancy in? \nDEWEY (surprised by the insight) I want to know the same thing. \nTruman hands Nelle one of the photos. She looks at it -- \nNELLE Twisted notion of tenderness. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DEWEY HOME - NIGHT \nTruman and Nelle are leaving. Alvin and Marie stand in the front door. Nelle kisses Marie. \nNELLE Thank you. \nMARIE So many of my friends would love to meet you. \nNELLE That'd be fine -- \nTRUMAN (to Dewey) You don't have to worry. I'm not going to write about this until everything's over. \nDEWEY I'm not worried. I know what room you're in at the hotel. And I know where you live in Brooklyn. \nTruman smiles. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

CLUTTER FARM - LATE AFTERNOON \nTruman and Nelle walk with PETE HOLT (70, very frail) on the Clutter property. Apples rot on the ground, the trees are bare, signs of disrepair are beginning to weather the house. \nHOLT (re the apples) I'd of picked them up but I haven't been myself. Mind you, I make the walk out here every day, check the house, make sure the pipes don't freeze -- that sort of item. The least I can do for Mr. Clutter. \nNELLE How long have you worked here? \nHOLT 1940 -- a lotta years. The wife too, cleaning the house. Cooking. \nNELLE Well, she's marvelous. Lunch was wonderful. \nHOLT (ignoring this) She had a hard job after what all happened. Cleaning. I burned most of the rest -- mattresses -- too far of a mess. (then, looks at them) I've asked around some -- if anyone's looking for a strong hand. \nThey don't know what to say. Finally, he looks away. \nHOLT I don't think they'll be able to sell the place till they catch the ones that did it. (beat) That's what I hear anyhow. \nSilence as the three of them look out over the barren fields. \nINT. CLUTTER HOUSE, BONNIE'S BEDROOM - DUSK \nJust the bed-frame -- the mattress is gone. Truman and Nelle find her Bible on the bedside table, her bookmark, see the painting of Jesus walking on water. Pete Holt stands off to the side, waiting patiently. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY \nPerry is lying on his cot reading an ADVENTURE MAGAZINE -- something to do with finding buried treasure off the coast of Mexico -- and sucking on the tip of his thumb. After a moment he STARTLES and looks up. \nTruman stands outside his cell. He holds a stack of books: Perry's PERSONAL DICTIONARY and DIARY, and a new WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY and THESAURUS. \nPERRY I didn't see you. Jesus, you... (stands, tucks in shirt) Come in. Where's the guard? \nTRUMAN I can't. I brought you some things, but I have to fly back East. \nPERRY When? \nTRUMAN An hour. I'm sorry. \nPERRY You can't. \nTRUMAN I'm sorry. \nPERRY Who are you going there to see -- \nHICKOCK (O.S.) (from next cell) Capote, get it straight in your book -- we never intended on killing that family -- \nPERRY I told him that. \nHICKOCK (O.S.) No premeditation -- \nPERRY I told him! \nPerry searches the cell for something else to give to Truman to keep him there. Then, he stops. He has nothing left to give, and is unwilling to talk about that night at the Clutters. He becomes very still. Truman speaks gently -- \nTRUMAN Your writings are magnificent. I hope these help you do more. \nNo response. Truman places the books on the floor just outside Perry's cell -- Perry's writings in one stack and the new dictionaries in another right next to it. \nTRUMAN I have so much material -- from the trial, from our visits, your journals. I have to organize it all, and I have to start the process of writing. (no response) I'll visit soon. Perhaps this fall. (backing away) I miss you already. Write me every five minutes. \nHe turns and goes. We stay with Perry as Truman leaves. We hear Dick speak to Truman. \nHICKOCK (O.S.) Be good now. \nHear Truman's footsteps receding. Then, a long shot of the hallway as the Guard lets Truman out the gate at the end of the row. Silence. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL \nPerry looks down at the books sitting on the floor outside his cell. He crouches, puts his hand through the bars and touches the cover of the new dictionary. He's alone. \nFADE OUT. \nOver black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then passing. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nFADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE SKY. Sounds of seagulls. Ocean, sand, cottage houses in greenery set back from the beach. \nEXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY \nThe house Jack rented. Jack types on the upstairs deck. Truman pulls up in an OLD TAXI. Jack looks out over the railing to the street. Jack emerges on the FRONT PORCH as Truman walks up the path with his bags. They look at each other. Then Truman looks around at the incredible garden, the ocean in the background, and starts to LAUGH. \nFADE OUT. \nTitle up:              \"January, 1962\" \nSound of a MANUAL TYPEWRITER over black. \nEXT.

I can't finish the book till I know what happens. If Perry and Dick are executed it's one thing -- and if not, well -- \nSHAWN Truman. You got your ending -- \nTRUMAN I really don't know -- \nSHAWN The Kansas court denied their appeal. It came over the wire on Friday. You need to talk to Perry now. He'll be dead by September. I'm sorry, I know how much you've come to care about him. \nTruman is completely immobile. \nSHAWN Truman? \nTRUMAN Right. Yes.

Truman toasts Jack drunkenly. \nTRUMAN My man, my hero, my talented... My man... \nJACK You said that. \nTRUMAN You are the hardest worker, the most unsung talent I know. As Nelle passes by on her way to London to sell her book which needs no selling, may a little of her success rub off on both of us. \nJack laughs. \nJACK Here, here! \nNelle tries to smack Truman but can't catch him. The song changes to a slow one. Jack and Truman dance sweetly together. Nelle sits on the sand and watches. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. UPSTAIRS DECK, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - MORNING \nBreakfast.

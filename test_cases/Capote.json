{"train": "CAPOTE \nWritten by \nDan Futterman \nBased on the book \"Capote: A Biography\" by Gerald Clarke \nTITLE UP:         \"Western Kansas, 1959\" \nEXT. FARMHOUSE - MORNING \nThe CAMERA follows a SIXTEEN YEAR OLD GIRL, long hair, pretty Sunday church dress, walking toward a peaceful farmhouse. At the door she lifts the knocker. The door opens slightly. The girl turns and looks past the camera at her MOTHER, sitting in an old Plymouth idling in the driveway. Her mother shrugs, motions for her to go inside. \nINT. FARMHOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nThe girl walks through the downstairs rooms. In the kitchen, the PHONE is OFF the hook. The girl looks back toward the open front door. She turns toward the stairs, climbs them. \nINT. FARMHOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALL - CONTINUOUS \nShe walks down the hall to a BEDROOM DOOR at the end. The door is slightly ajar. She knocks, then enters the room. \nINT. FARMHOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe girl's POV: the CAMERA pans across the bedroom of a high school coed. We see the desk, the bureau, the bed. On the bed lies NANCY CLUTTER, her wrists and legs bound in rope, SHOT in the head. There is blood on the wall. The sixteen year-old girl stands immobile. Before she starts to scream, \nCUT TO: \nEXT. KANSAS LANDSCAPE - DAY \nTrees ring the edge of a field. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. N.Y. CITYSCAPE, ESTABLISHING - NIGHT \nBuildings lit against the night sky. \nINT. NEW YORK APARTMENT BUILDING/STAIRS - NIGHT \nCamera follows group of partygoers as they mount the stairs: Truman Capote, Barbara (very tall), Rose, Christopher, Williams. \nINT. SMALL, PACKED NEW YORK APARTMENT/KITCHEN - LATER \nThe friends are standing in the crowded kitchen -- people are coming in and out -- talking and drinking and laughing. \nTRUMAN So Jimmy Baldwin tells me the plot of his book, and he says to me: the writing's going well, but I just want to make sure it's not one of those problem novels. I said: Jimmy, your novel's about a Negro homosexual who's in love with a Jew -- wouldn't you call that a problem? \nLaughter. \nCHRISTOPHER Susan's father had a minor heart attack, so she's writing more erotic poems about death and sex. \nBARBARA It's so tiresome. \nWILLIAMS Hmm. What rhymes with angina? \nLaughter. We see Truman watching everyone laugh. GRAYSON notices, leans in to him. As the rest of the group continues talking, we come closer, hear their conversation. \nGRAYSON How's your writing? \nTRUMAN Oh, I've got a million ideas of what to write next -- I just have to choose one. \nGRAYSON Really? \nTRUMAN No. \nTheir attention is pulled back into the group as: \nBARBARA Who would I want to play me? Natalie Wood. \nROSE Too fat. \nBARBARA Audrey Hepburn? \nROSE Not bad. Sort of middle-class. \nTRUMAN When a movie is made of my life I know exactly who I want as me... (beat) Marilyn Monroe. \nThe PORTERS leave. Nelle is stunned. Truman fiddles with the trunk locks, his back to Nelle. Silence, then: \nNELLE You're pathetic. \nTruman doesn't answer. \nNELLE You're pathetic. \nTRUMAN What? \nNELLE You paid them to say that. \nTruman won't look at her. She whacks him. \nNELLE You paid them to say that! \nTRUMAN (squealing) How'd you know? How did you know?! \nNELLE \"Just when you think they've gotten as good as they can get.\" \nTRUMAN You think that was too much? (laughter) I thought that was a good line. \nMore laughter. More smacking of Truman. Then it is quiet. \nNELLE Pathetic. \nINT. TRUMAN AND HARPER LEE'S CABIN, TRAIN - MORNING \nNelle's awake, but still in her bunk, looking out the window at the Kansas plains. Truman's dressing, watching her. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY \nTRAVELING SHOTS of harvested FIELDS, grazing LIVESTOCK, solitary FARMHOUSES. \nThe TRAIN chugs across the Kansas flatlands. \nSHOTS of SIGNS outside Garden City: \"World's Largest Free Swimpool\" and \"Howdy, Stranger! Welcome to Garden City. A Friendly Place. \" \nEXT. GARDEN CITY RENT-A-CAR - DAY \nTruman and Nelle rent a car. People stare. \nI/E. RENTAL CAR - DAY \nNelle drives past the main square, Truman in the passenger seat. Truman looks at a photo in THE GARDEN CITY TELEGRAM. \nTRUMAN Alvin Dewey, Kansas Bureau of Investigation. KBI. \nINT. LOBBY, WALKER HOTEL, GARDEN CITY - DAY \nTruman and Nelle check in. People stare. Nelle notices. \nEXT. FINNEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, GARDEN CITY - CONTINUOUS \nTruman and Nelle trot up the COURTHOUSE STEPS. \nINT. FINNEY COUNTY COURTHOUSE, LOBBY - MOMENTS LATER \nTruman approaches the GUARD DESK. \nTRUMAN Mr. Alvin Dewey, please. \nGUARD Third floor. In what used to be the Sheriff's Office. \nTruman CURTSIES. \nINT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY \nIn the reception area, ALVIN DEWEY and the two other KBI AGENTS assigned to the Clutter case are getting their jackets on and straightening their ties. They've completely taken over the office. They are: HAROLD \"Brother\" NYE (34); and ROY \"Curly CHURCH (60 - bald). They all smoke. \nSheriff WALTER SANDERSON -- 60's, kind, overweight -- is office-less (though he and his wife DOROTHY still live on the fourth floor of the Courthouse.) WALTER lurks in the background, nowhere to go, emptying one of many FILLED ASHTRAYS, BOTHERED by the SMOKE. Truman and Nelle enter as: \nCHURCH The wife said no more smoking in the house. I told her, \"Fine. Walter's got a couch upstairs in his apartment. I'll stay with him and Dorothy till we're done here.\" (to Walter) I've got my bag and a carton of cigarettes in the car. \nWALTER looks uncomfortable. Dewey shakes his head at Church. \nA SCHOOL BUS picks up a SMALL BOY at the intersection of a DIRT ROAD and the paved COUNTY ROAD. \nA SMALL BRIDGE over the Arkansas river. Below them, men are sifting the riverbed with nets, moving slowly downstream. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WALKER HOTEL, LOBBY - EARLY MORNING \nNelle waits by the FRONT DESK. The ELEVATOR DOORS open and Truman emerges. He is DRESSED SOBERLY -- NO LONG SCARF, NO LONG COAT. He walks toward Nelle, then TURNS as if he's a runway model, walks away, turns again and walks back. He stops a few feet in front of her. Nelle refuses to smile. \nNELLE Let's go. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOLCOMB TOWN ROAD - EARLY MORNING \nDanny Burke walks down the road with a bookbag over his shoulder. Nelle approaches him, Truman keeps his distance. \nNELLE Danny? (Danny stops) Would you mind terribly if I walked with you for a bit? \nHe shrugs. They walk together. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LAURA KINNEY HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nLaura opens door to Truman and Nelle. \nINT. LAURA KINNEY HOUSE, KITCHEN - AFTERNOON \nNelle and Laura Kinney sit at the table. Truman stands at the counter. \nLAURA I thought you were from the FBI with your long coat. \nTRUMAN Is that so? \nLAURA That's why I ran off. \nTRUMAN I've been getting a lot of that lately. \nTruman smiles. Laura smiles back, amused, a bit comforted. \nLAURA It's fine talking to you all. Practically nobody around here wants to talk since what happened. \nNELLE Folks have been through a rough patch. Including you. (Laura nods) Nancy was your best friend. \nLAURA She was my best friend. \nThey're quiet for a few moments. \nNELLE How has Danny been? \nLAURA Pretty shattered. Nothing terrible ever happened to him before. Nancy just started wearing his ring again after this huge fight -- Mr. Clutter was trying to get her to end it 'cause Danny's Catholic. \nNELLE What were the Clutters? \nLAURA Methodist. Danny was the last person at the house that night. That's why Mr. Dewey's keeps interviewing him -- they don't think he had anything to do with it -- just to see if he remembers anything unusual and all. \nNELLE People in town seem to wonder if he was involved. \nLAURA That's been real hard for Danny. \nTRUMAN Oh, it's the hardest -- when people have a notion about you and it's impossible to convince them otherwise. Since I was a child folks have thought they had me pegged because of the way I look and the way I talk. They're always wrong. (looks at her) Do you know what I mean? \nLaura stares at him and nods. He's clearly struck a chord. \nLAURA I want to show you something. \nShe goes in the door to the GROUND FLOOR APARTMENT. They see her through the LACE CURTAINS getting something from her DESK, which is stacked with books. Truman whispers to Nelle: \nTRUMAN Not one person here understands her. \nLaura returns. She hugs a SMALL BOOK to her chest. After a moment, she holds it out to them. \nLAURA Maybe you'll get a better picture of Nancy. And the family. \nNELLE What is this? \nTRUMAN (soberly) Thank you for having us. \nMARIE (mock serious) Thank you. (then:) Get yourselves in here. (turns and walks into the house) Alvin! Get your pants on. They're here. \nOn Nelle and Truman, surprised. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, LIVING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nA FOOTBALL GAME plays on the television. No one's watching. We can HEAR Alvin on the phone in his study at the back of the house. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nTruman and Marie at the stove. Nelle sits at the kitchen table. Truman has his jacket off and an apron on, as does Marie. They are peering into a POT OF BLACK-EYED PEAS. Marie is shaking in drops of HOT PEPPER TABASCO. \nTRUMAN More. More. \nMARIE Alvin will hate this. \nTRUMAN Yes, but we who know the truth will love it. \nMARIE (laughs) I have to stop. (then) I cannot believe you're from New Orleans. I miss it so much. \nTRUMAN I only lived there for a short while but my Mama was born and bred. \nMARIE You know something -- Alvin pretends he doesn't know who you are, but the minute you came to town he read your books. He had one of his men pick up \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" in Kansas City 'cause it's banned from the library here. \nTRUMAN What did Mr. Dewey think? \nMARIE He liked it more than he's willing to admit. \nTRUMAN How very foxy. \nMarie smiles at that word used to describe her husband. \nTRUMAN Mama would've put in half the bottle by now. \nBeat. \nMARIE Alright, one more shake. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nAlvin walks toward the kitchen. He smokes. He looks exhausted. He hears SQUEALS of laughter. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nAlvin enters. They all stop laughing and look at him. nods to Truman and Nelle. \nTRUMAN Hello. \nNELLE Hi. \nSilence. Marie sips her drink. \nMARIE How you doing, foxy? \nShe cracks up. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, DINING ROOM - LATER \nThe remains of dinner. The kids have left. The bottle of J&B sits on the table, half-empty. Marie's a bit drunk. Everyone's PLATE is clean except for Alvin's, on which sits a MOUND of uneaten black-eyed peas. Truman is mid-story. \nTRUMAN I was writing the script as they were filming, all that time in Italy. I'd work like mad all day long and then dash down to the bar around midnight to hand in the next day's scenes. Humphrey had just about moved into the hotel bar -- \nMARIE (whispers to Alvin) Humphrey Bogart. \nAlvin knows. \nTRUMAN -- where he and John drank every night -- \nMARIE (to Alvin) John Huston. \nAlvin knows. \nTRUMAN -- and I mean drank, like famished water buffaloes. Well -- I'd only just handed them the final scene when the bellhop told me I had a phone call. It was my stepfather, Joe Capote, calling to say that my mother had died. I flew home to New York -- terribly distraught -- but when I got to the apartment I could see that Joe was in even worse shape than I was. He grabbed my hands and sat me down at the kitchen table, and he said to me, \"Talk. Talk about anything, any subject in the world. Don't worry whether it will interest me or not. Just talk so I won't break down.\" And I did. He couldn't bear to be alone with his thoughts. It was too painful. \nIt's quiet for a moment, then Marie looks at Alvin. \nJazzy Christmas music on the RADIO. Nelle sits in the big armchair with a drink. She laughs. We HEAR Jack on the phone: \nJACK You're celebrating. \nWe see Truman wearing a YELLOW SILK SHORT ROBE with white lace, bare legs. He's on the phone and walking, for Nelle's enjoyment, back and forth, like a runway model. \nTRUMAN Remember Nelle's manuscript she sent me in New York? \nJACK Mockingbird. Killing a Mockingbird. You said it was good. \nTRUMAN And I was right. She just heard Lipincott wants to publish it. \nJACK (pause) Well. Jesus. That's terrific. Tell her congratulations. \nTRUMAN Congratulations. (covers phone, mouths to Nelle:) Jealous. \nJACK Just promise you'll be home by Christmas. \nTRUMAN I can't leave now Jack -- I mean it was hard at first, but now I'm practically the mayor. \nHe vamps. Nelle laughs. \nJACK Alright. \nTRUMAN I want to come home -- I do. Though if they catch whoever did this, who knows what -- I'll probably be here til next Christmas. \nJACK Right. I'll let you go. \nTRUMAN Jack, we'll go away this spring to write. Maybe Spain... \nJACK Alright, Truman. \nTRUMAN Bye. (hangs up) The poor boy misses me. \nGoes to the mini-bar to fix a drink. \nNELLE Truman. \nTRUMAN Nelle. \nNELLE You remember when we were kids? \nTRUMAN I was never a kid. I was born fully formed. \nNELLE I had no idea what a homosexual was. But I knew whatever they were, you were one of 'em. \nTruman puts down his drink and marches out of the room, shuts the door. Nelle's unsure whether she really insulted him. From the HALL, we hear a WOMAN SHRIEK, and a MAN saying: \nMAN IN HALL (O.S.) Oh. Uh. Oh. Excuse us. \nTruman runs back in, shuts door. They crack up. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DEWEY HOME - NIGHT, CHRISTMAS EVE, ESTABLISHING \nTasteful Christmas lights strung on the BUSHES. A WREATH on the FRONT DOOR. \nINT. DEWEY HOME, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nTruman, Nelle, Marie and Alvin. Drinks. A FULL ASHTRAY on the coffee table in front of Alvin. He's distracted, smoking. Marie holds a WOMEN'S MAGAZINE, checking what Truman says with what's written there. \nTRUMAN (quickly, as if reciting) -- girdle up -- no extra bulges -- if you're dressed right for him when he gets home, the evening should be smooth sailing. Bon voyage, gals. \nMARIE I can't believe you got this whole page -- I only read it to you once! \nTRUMAN I've trained myself. \nNELLE ...trained myself. \nTruman looks at Nelle. \nTRUMAN I have 94 percent recall. \nNELLE ...94 percent recall. \nTRUMAN (laughing) You cut that out. \nTruman watches Perry, transfixed. Perry seems terrified of the crowd, all the faces, like a child. Perry scans the crowd. His eyes fall on Truman. FLASH. FLASH. Truman and Perry look at each other as Perry is led slowly past. At the top of the steps the COURTHOUSE DOORS slam shut. \nFADE OUT: \nEXT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE (4TH FLOOR OF COURTHOUSE ) - MORNING \nFADE IN: Truman knocks on the door, a NEWSPAPER, a BOOK, and a PAPER BAG in his hand. On the door it says \"SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE - PRIVATE\". Dorothy Sanderson opens the door. \nDOROTHY Truman Capote. \nTRUMAN Dorothy Sanderson. I figured you'd be left alone this morning by that hard-working husband of yours. (holds up bag) So I have breakfast. (holds up paper) I have news. (book) And I have literature. My friend Jack mailed me the book you wanted. \nHe presents book. Dorothy, flattered, takes it, reads the inscription inside. \nDOROTHY \"For the maiden of the Midwest, the priestess of the plains, the queen of the kitchen: my first novel. Truman.\" \nIt is \"Other Voices, Other Rooms\" and we see on the back of it the INFAMOUS JACKET PHOTO of Truman at 23 draped sexily on a couch. Truman curtsies. The PHONE RINGS. \nDOROTHY You're too much. Go on into the living room, lemme grab that -- it's been ringing all morning. \nINT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, FOYER - CONTINUOUS \nTruman walks into the residence. To the left is the kitchen; to the right is the living room. Truman looks back at Dorothy -- she's still on the phone. He heads for the kitchen. \nINT. SHERIFF'S RESIDENCE, KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS \nTruman walks slowly through the doorway of the large kitchen. On the far side of the kitchen is a JAIL CELL. Inside the cell is PERRY SMITH. (Now we know why Truman came here.) \nTruman STARES. Perry doesn't see him -- he's resting his head on a small table, the tip of his THUMB in his mouth. The chair seems too tall for Perry. He looks like a lonely kindergartner, told to take his afternoon nap. After several moments, Dorothy enters, flustered: \nDOROTHY Oh. Truman. I meant in there. (points to living room) I... um... \nPerry sits up quickly, rubs his legs. \nDOROTHY It's the women's cell. It's hardly ever used. But they wanted to, um, separate... Please. Let's sit in the living room. I'll set up in the living room. \nShe gathers a tray of Truman's PASTRIES, and COFFEE CUPS. \nDOROTHY Come. \nShe goes -- Truman starts to follow, then lingers. \nTRUMAN They put you in the women's cell. \nPERRY Among other indignities. \nPerry's voice is oddly high, whispery -- special words are precisely enunciated. \nTRUMAN Well... she's a good cook. \nPERRY She's scared of me. \nTRUMAN I think so am I. A little bit. \nPERRY Are you? (a moment, then:) You have any aspirin? My legs -- \nDorothy's in the doorway. \nDOROTHY Um. Truman? All set. \nTruman looks at Dorothy, looks back at Perry. \nTRUMAN I'm sorry. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nJudge ROLAND TATE, white-haired, imperious, bangs his gavel. The packed crowd quiets down. Perry and Dick sit at the defense table chewing JUICY FRUIT GUM. Next to them: their aged court-appointed lawyer, Franklin Weeks (70). \nDick wears a SHIRT AND TIE. Perry wears jeans rolled up at the cuff, his SHIRT OPEN at the collar. He draws on a piece of paper with a STUBBY PENCIL -- a rather good picture of a LARGE PARROT. Truman sits with Nelle, watching Perry -- \nTRUMAN (murmurs) His feet don't touch the floor. \nJUDGE TATE In the matter of the State of Kansas v. Richard Eugene Hickock and Perry Edward Smith this Court has been informed by counsel -- Mr. Weeks -- that defendants wish to waive their right to Preliminary Hearing. Mr. Hickock, is that your wish? \nHickock looks at Weeks. Weeks nods. Hickock stands. \nTRUMAN Will you tell me if you need anything? I can have whatever you want sent from New York. (no answer) Will you do that? \nOn Perry, considering whether to trust this man. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEW YORKER, WILLIAM SHAWN'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nPhone RINGS, WILLIAM SHAWN answers (50, New Yorker editor, conservatively attired) at a desk looking onto 44th street. \nSHAWN William Shawn. \nTRUMAN (OVER PHONE) Gorgeous? \nSHAWN Truman. \nINTERCUT to Truman in a PHONE BOOTH outside the COURTHOUSE. \nINT. COURTHOUSE PHONEBOOTH - DAY \nTRUMAN I'm writing a book. It's too much for a single article -- this town, the killers most of all -- you will be stunned by Perry Smith -- \nSHAWN Why? What has he -- \nTRUMAN Not much yet, but I know. I can sense him. He's desperately lonely, frightened... I have questions -- are you ready? \nSHAWN Would it matter -- \nTRUMAN How much more money can you send me? How quickly can you get Dick Avedon out here to take some pictures? \nINTERCUT to WILLIAM SHAWN'S OFFICE. On Shawn -- he doesn't know how to begin to respond. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HICKOCK'S JAIL CELL - DAY \nPerry has been placed in an adjoining cell for the afternoon. He COMBS his greased hair in a mirror. A camera FLASHES. \nNelle and Truman sit outside the cells. Franklin Weeks dozes off to the side. RICHARD AVEDON -- small, dark, wiry, flamboyant -- is snapping photos of a bare-chested Hickock in the next cell, particularly his TATTOOS, while Hickock chatters away. \nHICKOCK Perry, honey. You look terrific... \nPerry is embarrassed, glances over at Truman. FLASH. \nHICKOCK Calm yourself down, sweetheart. \nPerry glances at Nelle. She MOTIONS to him that his SHIRT is buttoned wrong. Perry fixes it, looks back at her. \nHickock notices Truman gazing at his tattoos -- the one on his CHEST: the word PEACE, with a cross radiating rays of light. \nHICKOCK Be patient, Capote. Maybe later they'll send you my skin. \nTRUMAN I have the perfect place for it, over the hearth. \nHickock smiles. FLASH. Truman looks over at Perry, sitting alone. Truman starts to remove his TIE. \nPHOTOS, in quick succession: Of Hickock pulling up his sleeve to reveal his tattoos. Of Perry combing his HAIR. FLASH. The GRINNING CAT on Hickock's hand. FLASH. Perry looking directly at the camera. FLASH. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTHOUSE - MORNING, ONE MONTH LATER \nSeries of shots in and around the courthouse: \nTITLE UP:             \"One month later\" \nAn officer approaches down a long hallway. A janitor cleans the basin of the water fountain. Spectators are drawn into the courthouse. The officer opens the courtroom doors. A crescendo of sounds. \nINT. COURTROOM - DAY \nSpectators take seats. The jury files back into the box. Perry and Dick chew gum. Perry wears TRUMAN'S TIE, and draws on a pad with a NEW SET OF COLORED PENCILS -- another PARROT, quite beautiful, now YELLOW. Nelle and Truman sit together. \nNELLE Where'd Perry get the art set? \nTruman shrugs. Nelle raises her eyebrows. Judge Tate GAVELS loudly, looks to the jury. \nJUDGE TATE Members of the jury. Have you reached a verdict? \nTRUMAN He's as short as I am. And almost as pretty. I'd be with him right now but he's being given new accommodations -- \nGuests laugh. \nTRUMAN Most people assume he's a monster. I don't see him that way. The book I'm writing will return him to the realm of humanity -- it's the book I was always meant to write... \nNelle and Jack stand back, watching. \nJACK Watch out. This is the start of a great love affair. \nNELLE Oh yes. Truman in love with Truman. \nINT. LE PAVILLON RESTAURANT - DAY \nTruman is being interviewed over lunch. \nTRUMAN ...I was in Marilyn's apartment just last week. I had to break it to her that, of the four Matisses hanging on her wall, two were upside down. \nThe REPORTER laughs. A waiter passes. Truman taps his glass. \nTRUMAN Another. (to reporter) To answer your question, I'm following \"Breakfast at Tiffany's\" by blazing a different path -- by inventing an entirely new kind of writing: the non-fiction novel. \nREPORTER You have a subject? \nTruman takes a last sip of his drink -- utterly serious now. \nTRUMAN On the night of November 14, two men broke into a quite farmhouse in Kansas and murdered an entire family. Why did they do that? It's been suggested that this subject is tawdry -- it's not worthy of literature. I disagree. Two worlds exist in this country -- the quiet conservative life, and the life of those two men -- the underbelly, the criminally violent. Those worlds converged that bloody night. I spent the past three months interviewing everyone in Kansas touched by that violence. I spent hours talking to the killers -- and I'll spend more. (waiter brings his drink) Researching this work has changed my life, altered my point of view about almost everything. I think those who read it will be similarly affected. (he sips) Such a book can only be written by a journalist who has mastered the techniques of fiction -- \nREPORTER You're speaking of yourself. \nTRUMAN You're really very clever. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - DAY \nTruman sits in bed, writing on a yellow LEGAL PAD, surrounded by PILES of notes. He squints his eyes, concentrating. Jack enters, delivers a CUP OF COFFEE. Truman doesn't notice. \nINT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER \nTruman is rifling through the boxes, looking for particular notes. He can't find what he needs. The phone RINGS. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET, BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON \nJack and Truman walk. \nTRUMAN Perry's decided to appeal. He claims their attorney was incompetent -- that he never raised the issue of temporary insanity. \nJACK So you find them a new lawyer. \nTRUMAN They're facing execution in six weeks, Jack. They need someone to argue whether or not that's right. \nJACK Okay. \nTRUMAN I'd also like to see them alive, yes, thank you very much. I need to hear their story. \nThey walk in silence for a few moments. \nTRUMAN If you met him you'd understand. It's as if no-one's ever asked him a single question about himself. He's so... damaged -- and strange -- unexplored... (then) I don't trust this Hickock fellow. Perry's the only person who can describe to me what happened that night. I need to hear him say it. \nJACK Just be careful what you do to get what you want. \nTRUMAN I'm finding them a lawyer. \nJACK Truman. You're finding yourself a lawyer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR, DRIVING, TWO-LANE KANSAS HIGHWAY - DAY \nTruman drives alone, concentrating intently. He has to stretch to see over the dashboard. \nEXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY (KSP), LANSING - DAY \nA turreted, Civil War-era fortress an hour's drive from Kansas City. Truman pulls up to the GUARDHOUSE. \nTruman sees Perry, gaunt, lying on his cot, almost comatose. Perry's rather striking drawing of a LARGE YELLOW PARROT sits propped on his table. An UNEATEN LUNCH TRAY lies on the floor -- a cockroach runs over it. Truman watches, disturbed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT \nCamera follows Truman as he walks down an aisle with a small WICKER BASKET. He stops, looks at a shelf. \nINT. SUPERMARKET - NIGHT \nTruman waits in the check-out line behind a MOM paying for her groceries. Her SON (3) stands next to her legs, wearing a little cowboy hat and cradling a TOY GUN to his chest. He sucks his thumb. Truman and the boy look at each other. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY \nTruman sits on the chair, his WICKER BASKET on the table. He has spread out a cloth napkin. A GUARD watches from outside the cell. Perry lies completely still on the cot. Truman takes out jars of BONNET BABY FOOD, inspects the labels. \nTRUMAN (to Perry) I don't care what your plans are for yourself... \nHe decides on the CUSTARD jar. He opens it, takes a plastic BABY SPOON from the basket. \nTRUMAN But you're gonna wake up enough to tell me what you did with my tie. \nHe spoons a bit into Perry's mouth. The GUARD walks away. Truman leans close to Perry, whispers: \nTRUMAN It's okay. It's Truman. It's your friend. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (LATE AFTERNOON) \nPerry sleeps. Truman stands against the wall watching him. He has cleaned up the basket of food. He walks over to Perry's desk, sees two handwritten notebooks on it: THE PRIVATE DIARY OF PERRY EDWARD SMITH and PERSONAL DICTIONARY. Next to them, he sees a pencil SELF-PORTRAIT Perry drew. It's very good. Truman touches it. \nINT. KSP DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (EVENING) \nPerry sleeps. Truman sits on the chair watching, waiting. Perry opens his eyes, looks at Truman. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER (NIGHT) \nPerry is sitting up a bit, Truman helps him sip a cup of water. Perry lies back down. He's looking at Truman. \nTRUMAN How'd you learn to draw like that? \nPerry closes his eyes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR, DRIVING - AFTERNOON (NEXT DAY) \nTruman drives through the KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY gate, waves to the Guard. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - EVENING \nPerry sits on the bed, cleaned up, wet hair neatly combed, looking at a few OLD SNAPSHOTS he has saved in a handkerchief. Truman sits in the chair across from him. Perry hands him a photo of his mother. Perry speaks quietly. \nPERRY Before she had us. Before she started drinking. \nTRUMAN Who took care of you as a child? \nPERRY Orphanage. Me and Linda. \nTRUMAN That's your sister? \nPerry nods. Truman waits for more. It doesn't come. \nTRUMAN We're not so different as you might think. I was abandoned repeatedly as a child. My mama'd drag me along to some new town so she could take up with another man she'd met. Night after night she'd lock me in the hotel room -- Mama'd turn the latch and tell the staff not to let me out no matter what. I was terrified -- I'd scream my head off -- till finally I'd collapse on the carpet next to the door and fall asleep. After years of this she just left me with relatives in Alabama. \nPERRY Who raised you up? \nTRUMAN My Aunts. (Perry nods) That's when I met Nelle -- she lived next door. (looks again at the photo, hands it back) Your mother was Indian? \nPERRY Cherokee. \nTRUMAN Drinking was not a good thing for her. \nPERRY No tolerance for it. \nTRUMAN And your father? \nNELLE Christ. I guess it stopped being funny. \nTRUMAN I never said it was. (turns a page) Listen to this... \nEXT. KANSAS CITYSCAPE - VARIOUS (TWO WEEKS ELAPSE) \nINT. DINER, DOWNTOWN KANSAS CITY - MORNING \nTruman is eating breakfast with Alvin Dewey. A WAITRESS refills their coffees. \nDEWEY (to waitress) Thanks. \nShe leaves. An uncomfortable silence. Then: \nDEWEY You're nothing if not hard-working. \nTRUMAN You look good, healthy again. \nDEWEY Not a chance. \nDewey taps a cigarette out of his pack. \nTRUMAN I've decided on a title for my book. I think you'll like it -- very masculine. \"In Cold Blood.\" \nDEWEY (lights the cigarette) That refers to the crime or the fact that you're still talking to the criminals? \nTRUMAN The former, among other things. \nDEWEY I see. \nThey eat for a moment. Then: \nTRUMAN I've been wanting to ask if you'll let me look at your investigation notes. \nDEWEY That lawyer you helped find for your friends got them a hearing at the Kansas Supreme Court -- \nTRUMAN I heard this morning. \nDEWEY -- on the issue of inadequate counsel. \nTRUMAN Alvin. Do you not want me to look at your notes? You are permitted to say no. \nDEWEY (rises, takes out wallet) I'll tell you what: if those boys get off, I'm coming to Brooklyn to hunt you down. \nTruman can't decide whether Dewey is kidding or not. Dewey puts money on the table. \nDEWEY I have to be in court at nine o'clock. \nHe walks away. Over his shoulder: \nDEWEY Call Roy Church. He'll show you what you want to see. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY \nTruman walks down the hall. He passes Dick's cell. Dick is lying in bed. Dick rises and smiles widely at Truman. \nHICKOCK Hey, hey... \nTruman smiles, puts HIS FINGERS TO HIS LIPS, continues past. He stops outside Perry's cell. Perry (looking MUCH HEALTHIER) is drawing at his table -- a picture of the HUGE YELLOW PARROT swooping down from the sky. Truman watches for a few moments, then Perry looks at him. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Guard locks Truman inside with Perry. \nPERRY Thank you. \nTruman looks at the Guard -- he leaves. \nTRUMAN It was as much for me as for anyone. I couldn't bear the thought of losing you so soon. \nPERRY We're going to be able to use your book for our case. You'll write we never got to raise our insanity plea. You wrote how terrible the lawyer was? \nTRUMAN I haven't written a word yet. \nBeat. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY \nPerry is lying on his cot reading an ADVENTURE MAGAZINE -- something to do with finding buried treasure off the coast of Mexico -- and sucking on the tip of his thumb. After a moment he STARTLES and looks up. \nTruman stands outside his cell. He holds a stack of books: Perry's PERSONAL DICTIONARY and DIARY, and a new WEBSTER'S DICTIONARY and THESAURUS. \nPERRY I didn't see you. Jesus, you... (stands, tucks in shirt) Come in. Where's the guard? \nTRUMAN I can't. I brought you some things, but I have to fly back East. \nPERRY When? \nTRUMAN An hour. I'm sorry. \nPERRY You can't. \nTRUMAN I'm sorry. \nPERRY Who are you going there to see -- \nHICKOCK (O.S.) (from next cell) Capote, get it straight in your book -- we never intended on killing that family -- \nPERRY I told him that. \nHICKOCK (O.S.) No premeditation -- \nPERRY I told him! \nPerry searches the cell for something else to give to Truman to keep him there. Then, he stops. He has nothing left to give, and is unwilling to talk about that night at the Clutters. He becomes very still. Truman speaks gently -- \nTRUMAN Your writings are magnificent. I hope these help you do more. \nNo response. Truman places the books on the floor just outside Perry's cell -- Perry's writings in one stack and the new dictionaries in another right next to it. \nTRUMAN I have so much material -- from the trial, from our visits, your journals. I have to organize it all, and I have to start the process of writing. (no response) I'll visit soon. Perhaps this fall. (backing away) I miss you already. Write me every five minutes. \nHe turns and goes. We stay with Perry as Truman leaves. We hear Dick speak to Truman. \nHICKOCK (O.S.) Be good now. \nHear Truman's footsteps receding. Then, a long shot of the hallway as the Guard lets Truman out the gate at the end of the row. Silence. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL \nPerry looks down at the books sitting on the floor outside his cell. He crouches, puts his hand through the bars and touches the cover of the new dictionary. He's alone. \nFADE OUT. \nOver black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then passing. \nEXT. BEACH - DAY \nFADE IN: BRIGHT WHITE SKY. Sounds of seagulls. Ocean, sand, cottage houses in greenery set back from the beach. \nEXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY \nThe house Jack rented. Jack types on the upstairs deck. Truman pulls up in an OLD TAXI. Jack looks out over the railing to the street. Jack emerges on the FRONT PORCH as Truman walks up the path with his bags. They look at each other. Then Truman looks around at the incredible garden, the ocean in the background, and starts to LAUGH. \nFADE OUT. \nTitle up:              \"January, 1962\" \nSound of a MANUAL TYPEWRITER over black. \nEXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nFADE IN on the peaceful outside of the house. Sound of TYPING. \nINT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nMore typing. A PHONE rings. CAMERA tracks slowly through the pretty, tiled living room, toward a DOOR at the far end. \nINT. BEDROOM, RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nTruman at his DESK, surrounded by piles of filled YELLOW PADS, NOTE CARDS, an open TRUNK of random notes. He is at the MANUAL TYPEWRITER. The phone is on the floor, ringing. He types. The phone rings. Exasperated, he picks up. \nANDREWS Alright now. \nHICKOCK ...or they won't be able to rope you under your fat fucking chin. \nAndrews is led past Perry's cell. He looks in at Perry. \nANDREWS Next! \nAndrews shuffles down the hall. Perry watches him go. On Truman watching Perry. We hear the GATE slam shut. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THEATER - EVENING \nPacked. Nelle stands with William Shawn, who receives well- wishers. BEN BARON enters, seeing Nelle. \nBEN BARON (loudly, over the hubbub) Hello Hollywood. That's quite a bundle you sold your book for. \nNelle is embarrassed, mostly for Baron, to have the issue of money brought up publicly. \nNELLE Well... \nBaron moves past, Nelle smiles politely, whispers to Shawn. \nNELLE What a gentleman. \nINT. THEATER, BACKSTAGE ROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nTruman sits alone. In the background, we can HEAR the noise of the huge crowd gathering in the theater. Truman wears his MOST STYLISH LITERARY OUTFIT: a gorgeous dark green Knize SUIT over a black cashmere turtleneck sweater, and horn-rimmed GLASSES (which we've never seen him wear before). \nHe's frozen with anticipation, nervousness. After several moments a THEATER ASSISTANT opens the door. \nYOUNG ASSISTANT Mr. Capote. Can I get you anything? \nTRUMAN No. (clears his throat) Thank you. \nThe assistant leaves. We hear the crowd quiet down. Truman rises slowly, walks through the door to the backstage area. We hear William Shawn on stage. \nSHAWN (O.S.) Welcome New Yorkers... \nINT. WINGS/STAGE - NIGHT \nShawn pauses briefly for a laugh that doesn't come. Truman continues walking toward the backstage curtains. \nSHAWN (O.S.) Thank you for coming to the first public reading, the first offering of any kind, of Truman Capote's new work \"In Cold Blood.\" Our magazine -- \nTruman walks on stage. Loud applause. Shawn sees him, slinks back to his seat. Truman walks over to the podium, takes in the enormous crowd. Once it is completely quiet: \nTRUMAN Hello. My name is Truman Capote. \nPeople laugh and applaud loudly. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - SAME TIME, NIGHT \nPerry, eating dinner alone at his table, looks up. We HEAR a LOUD ENGINE revving outside. \nEXT. KSP, THE CORNER WAREHOUSE - SAME TIME \nA FRONT-LOADER TRACTOR drives into the warehouse. A PRISON POLICE CAR parks outside the warehouse. Guards get the enormous Lowell Lee Andrews, shackled, from the back seat, walk him inside. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT \nC/U on Perry, now standing on his chair and watching out the tiny window. \nCUT TO: \nINT THEATER, NYC - NIGHT \nTruman on stage reading. \nTRUMAN Perry Smith's voice was both gentle and prim -- a voice that, though soft, manufactured each sound exactly -- ejected it like a smoke ring issuing from a parson's mouth. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - SAME TIME \nTRUMAN I think so. You know they're scheduled for next month? \nSHAWN Hanging. Yes. I'll commit as many issues as it takes to publish. Three. As many as it takes. \nTRUMAN I'm flying to Kansas tomorrow. I'll get Perry to talk -- \nSHAWN Honestly, what's he got to lose? \nTruman smiles at the joke, then stops himself. \nTRUMAN It really is too awful. Institutionalized sadism. \nShawn nods. \nSHAWN You'll be able to finish now. \nTRUMAN As strange as it may sound to you, I'm going to miss him. \nFADE OUT. \nOver black -- the sound of a JET airplane -- loud, then passing. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - DAY \nTruman, flushed, out of breath, stands outside Perry's cell. He's just arrived. He holds a FOLDED-UP NEWSPAPER. Perry sits at his table reading LEGAL DOCUMENTS. \nTRUMAN When did you hear? \nPerry looks up, mistaking Truman's state for shared enthusiasm. He smiles widely. \nPERRY Two days ago. \nThe Guard opens the cell for Truman. Perry holds up one of the DOCUMENTS. \nPERRY It's what we've been waiting for. A stay of execution to make a federal appeal. \nTruman enters. Perry goes to him and hugs him tightly. \nPERRY All thanks to you. \nOn Truman, shocked, being hugged. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER \nTruman sits on the bed, his coat still on, watching Perry -- hyped up, talking, walking around the cell. \nPERRY Kansas's had it in for me for ten years -- in prison the first time, at that trial, here. They can't corner me now. Not till the U.S. Government says so -- \nTRUMAN Perry, sit down. For a minute. (Perry sits) I need you to talk to me... \nPERRY We've got all the time in the world to talk. About everything. I've been thinking about Ricardo. You need to stop sending him those trashy books. I won't even mention the pornography. (getting up) I realize he might have trouble grasping the literature you gave me, but those books only exacerbate the problem -- only 'heighten' or 'intensify' it. Maybe we should start him on a program... \nTRUMAN Perry. \nPERRY Give him the simple novels first -- \nTRUMAN Perry. \nPerry stops. \nTRUMAN I know what exacerbate means. \nPERRY Okay. I thought in case... \nTRUMAN There is not a word, or a sentence, or a concept, that you can illuminate for me. There is one singular reason that I keep coming here -- \nPERRY Truman -- \nTRUMAN ...November 14th, 1959. Three years ago. Three years. That's all I want to hear from you. \nPause. \nPERRY I've asked you not to -- \nTRUMAN (stands up) This is ridiculous. (to the Guard) I'm ready. (to Perry) I have a plane to catch. I found your sister in Tacoma. Maybe she'll talk to me about something useful. \nThe Guard unlocks the door. Perry STARTS TO MOVE toward it. The Guard SLAMS it shut. \nPERRY What's the name of your book? \nNo response. Perry can barely control his anger. \nPERRY What's the name of your book? \nTRUMAN I don't... \nPERRY What's the name of your book? \nTRUMAN I don't know what you're talking about. \nPerry picks up a cut-out ARTICLE from the NY Times from his desk. He reads. \nPERRY \"Truman Capote read last night before a packed audience from his non-fiction book IN COLD BLOOD.\" \nHe looks at Truman. \nPERRY More? (reads) \"The true-crime novel tells of killers Richard Hickock and Perry Smith, who brutally murdered a Kansas family three years ago.\" \nTRUMAN Who sent that to you? \nPerry doesn't answer. \nTRUMAN Who sent that to you? \nPERRY That's not your goddamn business. \nTRUMAN It is my business, because it's not true. The organizers of the reading needed a title. They picked one -- a sensational one, I admit -- to attract a crowd. \nPERRY They picked it. \nTRUMAN Yes. \nPERRY That's not your title. \nTRUMAN I haven't chosen one yet. \nPerry stares at him, not believing. \nTRUMAN How could I choose -- \nPERRY You pretend to be my friend... \nTRUMAN How could I choose a title when you still haven't told me what happened that night? How could I? I couldn't possibly. \nLong pause. Truman reaches in his breast pocket and extracts a PHOTO (the one of Perry and Linda splashing in the puddle.) \nTRUMAN I have something from your sister. \nHe hands it through the bars to Perry. Perry takes it. \nTRUMAN She misses you. \nPerry looks at the photo. After a few moments, Truman turns to the Guard. \nTRUMAN It's alright. I'll go in. \nThe Guard unlocks the cell. Truman enters. The Guard locks up, walks away. Perry is still looking at the PHOTO. \nTRUMAN I'm sorry. I should have told you what they made me call the book. (touches Perry's arm) I couldn't pretend to be your friend. The truth is, I can't help wanting to be. (silence, then:) You don't have to tell me anything if you don't want to. \nPerry looks at the photo of himself and his sister for a long time. \nPERRY Look at my belly. \nPerry sits on the bed. Then, almost to himself: \nPERRY There must be something wrong with us. To do what we did. \nTruman waits him out, sitting on the chair. Finally, Perry looks at him. When Perry speaks, it is quietly, completely matter-of-fact. \nPERRY We heard there was ten thousand dollars in that house. Once we'd tied up everybody and searched all over, I knew the guy who told us about it was wrong. There wasn't any money. But Dick wouldn't believe it. He went tearing through the house again, banging on the walls, looking for a safe. He said when he was done, he was going to come up to Nancy's room and have his way with her. I wouldn't allow it. I told him that. I sat with Nancy. \nCUT TO: \nTRUMAN Added up, how much money did you get from the Clutters? \nPerry thinks. \nPERRY Between forty and fifty dollars. \nTruman nods. They sit there for a long time. \nFADE OUT: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - DAWN, CONTINUOUS \nFADE IN: Hands typing on a MANUAL TYPEWRITER. \nTruman typing at the desk. He stops, removes the page from the typewriter, places it on top of a SMALL STACK OF PAGES. He sits back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PLANE - DAY \nTruman in his seat, sips a drink. He looks out the window. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET, BROOKLYN HEIGHTS - LATE AFTERNOON \nTruman walks with his TRAVEL BAG on his shoulder. He takes out his KEYS and turns up the steps to his house. \nINT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, FRONT HALL - CONTINUOUS \nTruman opens the door. \nTRUMAN Jack. \nNo answer. He walks down the hall to the BEDROOM. \nINT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nTruman enters, drops his travel bag on the bed, zips it open, removes a SMALL STACK OF TYPED PAGES. He walks to his desk. \nOn the desk, we see a HUGE STACK OF TYPED PAGES with a title page on top which reads: IN COLD BLOOD. Truman lifts the HUGE STACK, places the SMALL STACK under it. He smooths out the pages, then steps back from it. He calls out: \nTRUMAN Jack. \nNo answer. On Truman, standing in the middle of his room. He has finished all that he can finish, and is lost as to what to do next. \nFADE OUT. \nTITLE UP:          \"One Year Later\" \nOVER BLACK WE HEAR THE FOLLOWING DIALOGUE COME UP SLOWLY: \nTRUMAN (V.O.) ...I want to give it to you. The truth is, I'm desperate to be done with it... \nFADE IN: \nINT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY \nTruman on the PHONE, in pajamas, looking in the FRIDGE. \nTRUMAN Mr. Shawn, I... I've spent four years of my life on this book... They got a stay of execution yesterday... Another, yes.... \nHe gets out a jar of BONNET BABY FOOD CUSTARD and starts to eat it. Truman finds a bottle of J&B on the counter and pours a shot in his custard. \nTRUMAN Supreme Court.... \nHe stirs the custard, eats it. \nTRUMAN ...It's harrowing -- all I want is to write the ending and there's no fucking end in sight... No. No, I haven't been drinking again... \nINT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER \nTruman sits on the bed with a glass of bourbon, staring at the television. An empty jar of BABY CUSTARD sits on the bedside table. \nINT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER \nTruman on the bed, the television still on, another drink. We hear a DOORBELL. We hear Jack walk down the hall, answer the door, shut the door. Jack enters with a TELEGRAM. \nNELLE It must be hard. \nTRUMAN It's torture. They're torturing me. \nNELLE I see. \nNelle regards him for a moment. \nNELLE And how'd you like the movie, Truman. \nShe puts her drink down on the bar and walks away. Truman turns back to the bartender, shrugs. \nTRUMAN I frankly don't know what the fuss is about. \nOn Truman, alone at the bar. \nFADE OUT. \nEXT. STREET, OUTSIDE TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE - EARLY MORNING \nFADE UP on a PAPER BOY riding his BIKE down the street. New buds are on the trees. It is SPRING. The BOY wears a NEW YORK TIMES bag slung over his chest and is tossing copies of the paper. One of them lands on Truman and Jack's stoop. \nINT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - MORNING \nPhone RINGING. Truman asleep. \nINT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, JACK'S TINY OFFICE - SAME TIME \nJack is writing, longhand, at his desk. PHONE is ringing. Jack notices that his door is slightly ajar. He kicks it shut. The ringing is much quieter. He keeps writing. \nINT. TRUMAN AND JACK'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - SAME TIME \nTruman asleep. PHONE ringing. He wakes up, groggy, answers. \nTRUMAN Hello. \nOPERATOR (OVER PHONE) Mr. Capote? \nTRUMAN Yes? \nOPERATOR I have a call from Mr. Perry Smith in the Kansas Correctional System. Will you accept charges? \nPause. \nOPERATOR Mr. Truman Capote? \nTRUMAN Yes. \nOPERATOR Will you accept charges? \nTRUMAN Oh. (no way out of this) Uh... Yes. \nOPERATOR You'll accept charges? \nTRUMAN Yes. \nOPERATOR Mr. Smith, you're on the line. \nNow Truman's awake. We hear a series of CLICKS, then: \nPERRY (OVER PHONE) Hello. \nTruman can't bring himself to speak. \nPERRY Hello? I can't -- (to someone) This doesn't seem -- (we hear Perry clicking the cradle, then:) Operator, I don't think you put me -- \nTRUMAN I'm here. \nBeat. \nPERRY Truman. \nTRUMAN Hello, Perry. \nPERRY They let me make a couple phone calls before I go down to Holding... You heard the Supreme Court rejected the appeal. \nTRUMAN I didn't... I hadn't heard that. \nKRUTCH Time. \nTruman looks at the clock: 11:50pm. Truman turns to Perry and Dick. Perry stands. \nPERRY You'll be watching? \nTRUMAN I don't know. Do you want me to? \nPERRY I'd like to have a friend there. \nTRUMAN Okay. Then I will. \nTruman looks down, starts to cry. \nPERRY It's alright. \nTRUMAN I did everything I could. \nPERRY Okay. \nTRUMAN I truly did. \nPERRY I know. \nTruman nods, wipes his eyes. \nTRUMAN Goodbye, Perry. \nPERRY You're not rid of me yet. I'll see you in a few minutes. \nTruman goes. On Perry watching him leave. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nHuge. Dirt floor. Wooden gallows. TWENTY MEN stand around, some smoking. Some are silent. Some whisper quietly. \nJournalists. Also, Alvin Dewey and the KBI men: Church and Nye. Krutch in front of the gallows with a CHAPLAIN. At the foot of the gallows steps, the EXECUTIONER -- thin, older, a too-large pin-striped suit and stained cowboy hat. Truman. William Shawn. \nHEADLIGHTS, then a PRISON CAR enters, stops. Dick is extracted from the back seat. He stands, looks at the CROWD, then at the GALLOWS. The Guards nudge him forward. \nINT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nCLOCK reads 12:05pm. Perry sits alone looking at his hands. We HEAR A TRAP DOOR SPRING and CLATTER. Perry looks up. \nINT. PRISON CAR - NIGHT \nLight rain outside. Perry in the back seat being driven across the yard. He looks out his window, sees a PICKUP TRUCK drive out of the Corner Warehouse. On it: a BODY covered by a BLACK CLOTH. \nINT. CORNER WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe PRISON CAR enters, stops. Perry is removed from the back seat. He stands, looks at the assembled men, looks at Truman. He's nudged forward. As he passes DEWEY, he extends his hand: \nPERRY Nice to see you. \nDewey is caught off-guard so shakes his hand. Perry is led to the base of the gallows. \nKRUTCH Perry Edward Smith. (reads) \"For the crime of murder in the first degree, by order of the Court of Finney County and the Supreme Court of the sovereign State of Kansas, you are sentenced to hang until you die.\" (then) You can say something if you want. \nPERRY (quietly, to Krutch) Is there anybody from the family here? \nKRUTCH No. \nPerry is disappointed by this information. \nPERRY Well. Tell them... (he look out at everyone) I can't remember what I was going to say for the life of me... \nHe stops. Several moments. \nKrutch can't tell if he's done. Finally, Krutch nods to the Guard. Perry is led up the STEPS. The Chaplain follows. \nCHAPLAIN Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. \nThe Executioner puts the NOOSE around Perry's neck. Perry chews his gum. Executioner opens a BLACK CLOTH SACK. \nPerry looks at the Chaplain reading prayers, looks at the crowd, at Truman. \n", "test1_input": "JOURNALIST #2 Is there any evidence of, I'm sorry, sexual molestation of the women? \nDEWEY No. \nJOURNALIST #2 Anything else stolen? \nDEWEY Kenyon's radio seems to be the only... \nJOURNALIST #3 The boy was sixteen? \nDEWEY Fifteen. Nancy was sixteen. \nJOURNALIST #2 It's her friend that found them? \nDEWEY Laura Kinney. \nJOURNALIST #2 Spell that? \nDEWEY I assume you're okay with the Laura part. K-I-N-N-E-Y. But, please, leave her be. \nLots of folks try to talk at once, one OLD MAN makes himself heard above the rest: \nOLD MAN There's talk of a bunch of Mexicans, a whole bunch of Mexicans... \nDEWEY (standing, stubs out cigarette) George, it's good to see you again. I do have an opinion whether this was the work of one man or a whole bunch, as you said, but it doesn't matter a whole lot whether it was Mexicans or Methodists or Eskimos. We're going to find whoever did this. Four good people from our community are dead. Let's remember that. Okay with you? (holds up a notice) The West Kansas Farm Committee's offering a thousand dollar reward for information leading to an arrest. Please print that. (moving to the exit) Thank you all for coming. \nThe room is immediately noisy as Dewey makes his way to the door, pulling a pack of cigarettes from his pocket, followed by Church and Nye. He's about to step out when Truman catches his eye. Dewey exits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RENTAL CAR - LATE AFTERNOON \nNelle drives while consulting a MAP. Truman is leaning back, looking out at the passing farms through the window. He speaks almost to himself. \nTRUMAN Mr. Dewey's protective of the Clutters. I wonder how well he knew them... \nNelle glances over at him. He doesn't notice. \nTRUMAN He was foxy with that old man. (turns to Nelle) Are you ever gonna let me drive? \nNELLE Truman, you're a menace. You can barely see over the wheel. \nTruman looks back out the window at the farms, leans back. \nNELLE This make you miss Alabama? \nTRUMAN (rolling window down, shakes his head) Not even a little bit. \nHe leans his head out, closes his eyes. \nEXT. CLUTTER FARM - SUNSET \nNelle pulls their car to the side of the COUNTY ROAD which fronts the CLUTTER FARM. We recognize the FARMHOUSE as the one in which Nancy Clutter was found dead. A HIGHWAY PATROLMAN (20 years old) sits in a CRUISER parked up the driveway. \nCRIME SCENE TAPE marks the perimeter of the property. Truman and Nelle get out of their car, stand at the foot of the driveway, gazing at the lonely farmhouse. \nFADE OUT. \nEXT. HOLCOMB HIGH SCHOOL - MORNING \nA gorgeous fall day. Crowds of kids arriving at school. Many are SOMBER. As Truman and Nelle walk toward the kids, some look warily at Truman and give him a wide berth. \nTRUMAN Hello. \nKids back away. Nelle notices. She leaves Truman, walks up to a group of THREE GIRLS. \nNELLE Morning. \nGIRL #1 Hi. \nNELLE Can any of you tell me where I'd find Laura Kinney? \nGIRL #1 Oh, um... \nThe girl glances toward the school entrance where LAURA KINNEY (who found Nancy Clutter's body) walks with DANNY BURKE (tall, \nNELLE (gently) Is that her? With the tall boy? \n", "test1_true": "NELLE Danny Burke? (Girl #2 nods) Thank you. \nAs Nelle leaves, Girl #1 turns to her friend: \nGIRL #2 Oh, quiet yourself, Janice. \nNelle sees Truman on his way toward Laura, calls out -- \nNELLE Truman. Truman -- \nTruman doesn't hear. She watches Truman approach them. Laura backs away. Danny leads her off. Nelle walks over to Truman, looks at him for several moments. \nNELLE These folks live their lives in a particular way. You need to consider adapting yourself to that fact. \nTRUMAN What -- \nNELLE -- I'm gonna find out where those two kids live. Maybe you'll let me do that alone? \nNelle leaves. On Truman, as the bell rings and the mass of teenagers starts to enter the school. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET, GARDEN CITY - DAY \nTruman walks alone, sees the Gilbart Funeral Home. He removes his hat, slips past the few people standing outside. \nINT. GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS \nWarm but slightly tacky. Some people are engaged in hushed conversation at the reception area. Truman slips past, into the back room. \nINT. BACK ROOM, GILBART FUNERAL HOME - CONTINUOUS \nNo people, low light. Four CLOSED CASKETS at the back of the room. Truman walks over slowly. After a moment, he checks to make sure he's alone. Then he LIFTS THE TOP of one of the caskets. It's Bonnie Clutter's body, in a long-sleaved navy- blue dress; but her head is wrapped in layers and layers of white cotton gauze, and lacquered with a shiny substance -- like an enormous cocoon. Truman stares. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WALKER HOTEL, TRUMAN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nTruman on the PHONE to Jack in Brooklyn. One of Truman's trunks is open, displaying bottles of liquor, packaged and tinned gourmet food, and stacks of unused yellow legal pads. He drinks, standing at the window. \nJACK (OVER PHONE) I think I scared a friend of yours this morning. He came looking for you while I was writing. \nTRUMAN You hate my friends. \nJACK I wouldn't say hate. So long as they don't knock on my door. \nTRUMAN I saw the bodies today. \nJACK Which? \nTRUMAN The Clutters. I looked inside the coffins. \nJACK That's horrifying. \nTRUMAN It comforts me -- something so horrifying it's freeing. It's a relief. Normal life falls away. (beat) But, then, I was never much for normal life -- \nJACK No, you weren't. \nTRUMAN People here won't talk to me. They want someone like you, like Nelle. Me they hate. \nJACK I can't think of a single quality I share with Nelle. \nTRUMAN Well -- \nJACK Maybe manliness. \nTRUMAN My point exactly. \nJACK It's why I left the Midwest in the first place. I knew I could only find someone like you in New York City. \nOn Truman, gazing at the EMPTY TOWN SQUARE below. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. GARDEN CITY, VARIOUS - EARLY MORNING \nA SHOPKEEPER sweeps the sidewalk. There are THANKSGIVING DECORATIONS in his shop window. \n", "test1_id": 2886, "test2_input": "NELLE (to Truman) When was the last time you wrote back to him? \nTRUMAN I don't know. \nJACK What's this? \nNELLE A letter for your boyfriend I was asked to deliver. \nTRUMAN From Perry. \nJACK Let's have it. \nJack sits. Nelle opens the letter, reads: \nNELLE \"Dear Friend Truman. Where are you? Read this item in a medical dictionary: \"Death by hanging is caused by asphyxia, by fracture of the cervical vertebrae, by laceration of the trachea.\" Not too comforting as we lost our appeal. Missing you -- alone and desirous of your presence. Your amigo, Perry.\" \nPause. \nTRUMAN Mr. Shawn told me about the court decision yesterday. \nJACK I was wondering why you were in such a good mood. Surely, I thought, it's not because I finished my little book. \nTRUMAN That's a terrible thing to say. \nJack looks out at the ocean. \nTRUMAN (to no one in particular) I used to write him all the time. I've been so focused lately on the book. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RENTED COTTAGE HOUSE - DAY \nTruman and Nelle carry her bags down the front walk toward a waiting TAXI. \nTRUMAN Jack says I'm using Perry, but he also thinks I fell in love with him when I was in Kansas. How both of those things can be true is beyond me. \nNELLE Did you? Fall in love with him. \nSilence as they load the bags into the trunk. \nNELLE Truman? -- \nTRUMAN I don't know how to answer that... It's as if Perry and I started life in the same house. One day he stood up and walked out the back door while I walked out the front. With some different choices, he's the man I might have become. \nNELLE Are you kidding me? \nTruman shrugs, doesn't answer. Nelle kisses him. \nNELLE Be nice to Jack. Sometimes I think he's what I like about you best. \nTRUMAN (smiles) I'll see you at the reading in New York. \nNELLE The sixteenth. \nNelle gets in the taxi, then leans her head out the window. \nNELLE Truman. Honestly. Are you going back to Kansas because you care about Perry or because you need information before he's killed? \nTRUMAN Can't it be both? \nNELLE No. I don't think it can be. \nShe drives away. Truman watches her go. He turns back up toward the house, stops a moment to pick a FLOWER from the bushes at the front gate. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY \nA Guard walks down the corridor carrying a SINGLE FLOWER. He delivers it to Perry, then walks off. Perry is confused. He hears FOOTSTEPS approaching, but can't see who it is. \nHICKOCK (O.S.) Hey, buddy. Thanks. \nMore footsteps. CAMERA on Perry as the footsteps finally arrive outside his cell. He's shocked. \nREVERSE onto Truman, looking tanned, healthy, very blond. He holds a STACK OF BOOKS with a BOW on top. He smiles. \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_true": "LONG SHOT of dimly lit corridor, light spilling out from each cell. A ROW GUARD walks the hall. We hear voices murmuring. \nSIX MORE GUARDS arrive at the top of the stairs. The ROW GUARD walks over, unlocks the GATE to let them in. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - NIGHT \nPerry is looking at the cover of a BOOK -- \"WALDEN POND.\" Other books sit next to Perry on the cot. Among them -- WILLA CATHER's \"MY ANTONIA\", also \"GREAT EXPECTATIONS\" -- \nPERRY What was he in jail for? \nTRUMAN They said it was not paying his taxes. But really for being an outsider -- refusing to go along. \nPerry nods, looks at the other books. \nTRUMAN You don't have to read any of these if you don't want to. But I thought you'd like something decent. You're much too smart for adventure magazines. \nThrough the bars of Perry's cell, we can see the SIX GUARDS enter Lowell Lee Andrew's cell (diagonally across the corridor). The ROW GUARD appears at Perry's cell. \nROW GUARD Lock-down while Lowell goes to solitary. Nobody in or out. (to Truman) You want in or out? \nTruman looks at Perry, then back to the Guard. \nTRUMAN In. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, LOWELL LEE ANDREW'S CELL - MOMENTS LATER \nThe SIX GUARDS start to pack up Andrews cell while he sits on the cot and watches. \nINT. KSP, DEATH ROW, PERRY'S CELL - LATER \nPerry and Truman talk very QUIETLY. (Throughout this scene, we see in the background, across the corridor, the mostly obscured cell of Andrews. We see his incredibly FAT LEG being shackled, his belongings being packed in boxes.) \nPERRY Everyone says he's a genius. I don't think he's a genius. He's rich and he went to college -- like any of us would've if we got the chance. He came home for Christmas and shot his parents -- \nTRUMAN -- in front of the television. \nPERRY You remember the story -- \nTRUMAN They were watching Father Knows Best. \nThey look at each other and smile. Then: \nPERRY I won't be sorry to see him go. Always correcting my grammar. \nThey watch Andrews being shackled in the background. \nPERRY Now -- Dick and me -- we're next in line. \nTruman regards Perry, who looks down. \nTRUMAN I'm so sorry I've been away. \nPERRY It was a long time. \nTRUMAN I know. \nPERRY I wish you could come next week, when they take him out to the Corner, but the whole prison shuts down. \nTRUMAN I have to be in New York anyway. \nPerry nods. \nPERRY How's the book going? \nTRUMAN Very slowly. \nPERRY Will you show it to me? \nTRUMAN I've hardly written anything. \nOne of the six guards CLANGS Andrews' cell bars with his stick. \nGUARD #1 Ready. \nThe ROW GUARD opens the cell door. Andrews is led out, arms and legs shackled, into the corridor. \nHICKOCK Keep your head high, buddy. \n", "test2_id": 2887, "test3_input": "INT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - NIGHT \nPerry sits alone. The door opens and a Guard brings in his LAST MEAL: three hot dogs, french fries, an ice cream sundae, a strawberry soda. The Guard sets it down on the chair. \nPERRY Thank you. (then) You sent the telegram to his hotel? \nGUARD Hours ago. \nPerry looks at the CLOCK on the wall: it's after 8pm. \nPERRY May I make a phone call? \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM, MUEHLEBACH HOTEL, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT \nPHONE ringing. The CLOCK rads 8:55pm. Empty drinks glasses, a custard jar. Truman lies curled in a fetal position on the BED. Shawn walks the floor, exasperated. \nSHAWN That's him again. \nTruman is immobile. Phone still rings. \nSHAWN We've never even met. It is utterly inappropriate for me to be talking to him. \nShawn gives up, PICKS UP the phone. \nSHAWN Yes... I'm sorry, he's out, gone out... I'm not sure when... \nCUT TO: \nINT. KSP, HALLWAY - NIGHT \nKrutch walks with a TELEGRAM PAGE in hand. A Guard follows. They pass a WALL CLOCK: 9:40pm. \nINT. KSP, CONFINEMENT CELL - NIGHT \nKrutch and Guard enter Perry's cell. Perry hasn't touched his meal. \nKRUTCH You got a telex. \nPerry nods. Krutch reads: \nKRUTCH \"Perry. Unable to visit today because not permitted. Always your friend, Truman.\" (apologetically) That's it. \nPERRY It's not true, is it? \nKrutch hesitates a moment, then SHAKES his head. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NELLE'S KITCHEN, MONROEVILLE - MINUTES LATER \nNelle on the PHONE looking at a TELEGRAM. The kitchen CLOCK reads 10:20pm. She waits a moment till the line is answered. \nNELLE (ON PHONE) Mr. Shawn? It's Nelle... I just got this telegram, has he seen it? \nINTERCUT with William Shawn on the phone in Truman's hotel room. A TELEGRAM lies on the DESK. Truman lies on the bed. \nINT. MUEHLEBACH HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT \nSHAWN (ON PHONE) He won't look at it. \nNELLE Would you put him on please? \nSHAWN He won't talk. \nNELLE (calmly) Mr. Shawn, if you have to hold him down and put the phone on his ear, I need to speak to him. \nShawn, terrifically uncomfortable, walks over to Truman and holds the phone out to him. \nSHAWN It's Nelle. \nA moment, then Truman takes the phone. On Truman's face. We hear, through the receiver, Nelle: \nNELLE (OVER PHONE) Truman. \nTruman finally breathes out. \n", "test3_true": "INT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - SAME TIME \nPerry is led, SHACKLED, into a holding cell on the ground floor of the Death Row Building. Dick is already there, seated, shackled. We HEAR PERRY'S VOICE: \nPERRY (V.O.) \"Miss Nelle Harper Lee and Truman Capote: Sorry that Truman was unable to make it here at the prison for a brief word prior to necktie party... \nThe CLOCK reads 11:05pm. Through the WINDOW, we see activity in the Gallows Warehouse across the yard. \nPERRY (V.O.) ...Whatever his reason for not showing up, I want him to know that I cannot condemn him for it and understand... \nPerry makes eye contact with the Guard, who CHEWS GUM. The Guard checks through the SMALL WINDOW in the door, then approaches Perry, places a STICK OF GUM in Perry's mouth. Perry CHEWS. \nPERRY (V.O.) ...Not much time left but want you both to know that I've been sincerely grateful for your friendship through the years and everything else... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MUEHLEBACH HOTEL ROOM, KANSAS CITY - NIGHT \nTruman opens the door to the other part of the suite, where William Shawn is waiting. Truman is fully dressed and ready. Perry's VOICE: \nPERRY (V.O.) ...I'm not very good at these things.... \nEXT. KANSAS STATE PENITENTIARY - NIGHT \nTAXICAB pulls up to the prison gates. Perry's VOICE: \nPERRY (V.O.) I have become extremely affectionate toward you both. But, harness time. Adios amigos. Your friend, Perry.\" \nINT. KSP, WAITING ROOM OUTSIDE CELLS - NIGHT \nClock reads 11:35pm. Truman sits with Shawn. Truman is looking at the TELEGRAM from Perry. He folds it, puts it in the breast pocket of his jacket. Krutch approaches. \nKRUTCH I didn't think I'd be seeing you again. (then) You can visit for a few minutes. \nTruman stands, turns to Shawn, still seated. \nSHAWN No. \nTRUMAN Come with me. \nSHAWN Truman. No. \nTruman goes alone. \nINT. KSP, HOLDING CELL - NIGHT \nPerry, Dick, a Guard. Krutch lets Truman in. \nKRUTCH Five minutes. \nHe exits, closes the door. Truman doesn't know what to say. \nHICKOCK (without rancor) He returns. Long time. \nTRUMAN I don't know what you must think of me. \nHICKOCK You haven't been foremost on my mind lately. As you can imagine. \nDick looks at Perry and smiles. Perry chews his gum and smiles back, then looks to Truman who seems upset. \nPERRY You got the letter? \nTRUMAN Yes. \nPERRY It's true. I mean I understand why you didn't want to come. I wouldn't be here either if I didn't have to. \nHICKOCK You got that right. \nSilence. \nPERRY You know Ricardo donated his eyes to science? Next week, some blind man will be seeing what Dick used to see. \nHICKOCK (laughs) He'd be better off the way he was. What I've seen hasn't been so nice to look at -- but I guess it's better than nothing. (he shrugs, to Truman) They came around with a form. (beat) Hey. You'll be walking down the street one day in Denver, wherever -- and suddenly these eyes will be staring at you. Wouldn't that be something? \nTRUMAN (quietly) It would be. \nKrutch opens the door. \n", "test3_id": 2888}

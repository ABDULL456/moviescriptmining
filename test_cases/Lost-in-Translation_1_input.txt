BOB I'm sorry. 
CHARLOTTE That lunch was the worst, huh. 
He laughs. 
She looks down at his feet stuffed into the little hotel slippers. 
CHARLOTTE When are you leaving? 
BOB Tomorrow. 
CHARLOTTE (friendly) I'm going to miss you. 
BOB That's what you said the other night. 
CHARLOTTE Well, I mean it more now. 
CUT TO: 
INT. PARK HYATT BAR - NIGHT 
and Charlotte, still in their pajamas, sit at their usual spot at the bar, with the bartender, drinking cold sake. She lights two cigarettes and passes one to him. 
A NEW JAZZ BAND is now playing. The SINGER is full of enthusiasm as they start their stint at the Park Hyatt. 
NEW SINGER Good Evening. I'm Carl West, and we're thrilled to be joining you this week, here at the NY bar in Shinjuku. 
He sings "Where or When" with all his heart. 
Now, old-timers there, Bob and Charlotte look at each other and chuckle. 
SINGER Jt seems we stood and talked like this before,   we looked at  each other in  the same way thenr   but I cant remember where or when... 
Bob and Charlotte sit there together. 
BOB I don't want to go back tomorrow. 
CHARLOTTE I know. But, it doesn't last, you have to go back sometime. 
BOB Why can't it last? 
CHARLOTTE I don't know, it just doesn't, reality changes things....we can't stay here forever, unless maybe we started a Jazz band. 
(alt Charlotte dialog: I don't know it just doesn't, reality changes things...and we can't stay here forever) 
He looks over at her. 
The singer continues Where or When, as they sit there together, the view sparkling. 
SINGER (O.C.) Somethings  that happen for the first time,   seem to be happening again and so it  seems we have met before, and laughed before,   and loved before,   but who knows where or when... 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT 
Bob and Charlotte, drunk in the elevator. 
CHARLOTTE

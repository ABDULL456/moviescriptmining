JESSICA Thank you. 
EXT. CARTER'S HOUSE, FRONT YARD -- NIGHT 
EMILY, her back up against a tree, continues making out with an aggressive MALE PARTYGOER 1. As MALE PARTYGOER 1 comes up for air, we see that he has a hand down Emily's pants, fingering her. Emily's mind is somewhere else. 
Emily snaps back to reality and removes Male Partygoer 1's hand and pushes him away from her - she won't become another slut in a town full of them. 
MALE PARTYGOER 1 Hey, what's wrong? 
Emily makes for the front door and into the house.

MITCH has refilled his BEER and patiently waits for a counteroffer from COREY. 
COREY How about two thousand even? 
Impatient with the proceedings, PEDRO walks over to the passenger door of the Mustang, swings it open, and leans inside, struggling a bit. 
MITCH Can't do it. 
COREY Why not? 
MITCH It's not economically... (searching for the word) Good, right, sound, whatever. 
Pedro reappears from the backseat, holding an expensive STEREO. 
PEDRO Okay, give us two thousand and I give you this nice stereo for free. 
MITCH Where the hell you get that? 
COREY Yeah, what the hell is that?! 
PEDRO (to Mitch) It was in the car. 
MITCH I don't want a stereo. 
PEDRO You can have it for free, mehn. 
MITCH Where's the speakers? 
PEDRO In the back. 
Corey walks over, opens the door and looks in the back.   His gaze falls upon an item on the floor in the back seat area. 
PEDRO (CONT'D) (O.S.) This stereo's a motherfucker, mehn, I'm telling you. I was gonna keep it myself. 
Corey pulls out from the back seat of the Mustang holding a large red and blue POLICE LIGHT. He is dumbfounded. Corey looks to Pedro for an explanation. 
PEDRO (CONT'D) What's that? 
COREY I thought you'd tell me! 
MITCH It looks like police cherries. 
COREY It can't be. 
MITCH Look fellas, I'd like to help you out, but I'm not into buying stolen cop cars. It don't seem right somehow. 
Corey and Pedro struggle for an explanation, but are left speechless.

JESSICA and AARON are leaning against a random partygoer's CAR. They look very calm. 
JESSICA I didn't cheat. 
AARON Fine, you say so, fine. 
JESSICA That's it? 
AARON Well what the hell can I do? There's nothin'. I got your goddam initials tattoo'd next to my balls. 
JESSICA It was a stupid thing to do. 
AARON You don't like it?! 
JESSICA Well of course I like it!       But what if we break up? 
AARON Yeah, I thought about that.    I'll say it's for Jesus H. Christ. 
JESSICA Great. Then you could start going to church. 
Two POLICE CARS pull onto the lawn to break up the party, both cars flashing their red and blue lights. TROY approaches Jessica and Aaron. 
TROY Cops're here. I'm goin'. 
AARON (to Jessica) You need a lift? 
JESSICA Okay.

ELIJAH Let 'er rip, Toad! 
Toad yanks a pull-start cord and the machine rumbles to life. Elijah pulls the Tasty Freekz lever and fills a small dish with phosphorescent ointment. Toad cuts open their clothes, exposing their sides, and pushes them close together. 
ERNIE Wait a second. You're really gonna smear that stuff on us and mutate our body parts!? 
ELIJAH Correct. 
ERNIE Well... then could you give me a really big rodney? 
ELIJAH I'm a mad scientist pal, not a miracle worker. 
Elijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides. Their skin begins to bubble and undulate. 
JULIE/ERNIE Oh God!... No!... Holy shit! (ETC) 
A grapefruit-sized lump pops up on Ernie's side, then another on Julie's side, and then the lumps do a little synchronized dance together. Suddenly Ernie's flesh balloons out and melds into Julie's side. The mass of connected skin continues to bubble and mutate. Odd shapes press up under THE SKIN: 
Four humans faces that quickly become Mount Rushmore... 
The Pepsi logo--"Pepsi: The Choice of a New Generation"... Julie and Ernie merge into one amorphous flesh blob which then takes the form of... 
Demon versions of GUMBY and his magic horse POKEY. Gumby's got his back to camera. He's grabbing his crotch and flipping everyone off. 
ELIJAH Gumby! Put that thing away! 
Gumby and Pokey mutate back into a blob and then into... 
JULIE/ERNIE 
joined side to side, their two heads on a single body which is split down the middle--half Julie, half Ernie. Elijah wheels a large mirror in front of them. 
ELIJAH Feast your eyes! 
JULIE NOOOOO! 
ERNIE Well, at least I'll never have to go far for a piece of tail. 
JULIE Pig! 
She SMACKS him. 
ERNIE Ouch! I was just trying to keep things light. Oh God! Why me!? 
He starts blubbering uncontrollably. Toad drags them towards the door. 
JULIE Mother always said there'd be days like this. And I thought she was nuts! 
They exit. Elijah turns to Rick. 
ELIJAH (gestures to Julie/Ernie) A mere party trick. But you, you're gonna be special. 
Elijah steps over to the computer console and starts punching keys. 
RICK (GETS TOUGH) Let me go, Skuggs, or else! (MORE) 
I got some RICK(cont'd) friends that'll come down here and mess you up bad, homey! (Elijah chuckles. Rick tries a different APPROACH) I got some other friends who can score you box seats at the Superbowl, no problem. (ANOTHER FAILURE) YOU EVER HAD YOUR BALLS CUT OFF, YOU FUCKIN' APE?! (switches gears again) You ever had a hot fudge bath with Morgana? [foreign take: Madonna] 
ELIJAH (LOOKS UP--INTERESTED) You know her? 
Rick nods hopefully. Elijah considers it for a moment, then frowns. 
ELIJAH Ah, screw it. I'd never get anywhere with her. TOAD! FIRE UP THAT INFERNAL YOGURT MACHINE! 
Toad starts the machine. Elijah pulls the lever and dispenses a bowl full of glowing ointment. He carries it towards Rick, leering maniacally. 
ELIJAH For years I've strived to create the ultimate monster. The first of a whole new generation of superfreaks! Now I've finally got you, the perfect subject--a real asshole! HA-HA- (he pauses and looks closer at Rick) Wait a minute. Aren't you the guy from "Hey Dude Three-The Beguiling?" 
RICK Yeah, that's me! 
ELIJAH You were great in that picture! Oh well, I guess for the next one they'll have to get Christian Slater! HA-HA-HA! 
Elijah squishes the ointment into Rick's horrified face.

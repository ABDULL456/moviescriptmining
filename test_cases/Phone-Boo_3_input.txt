FELICIA The man don't sound like he means it. 
LEON I agree. (to Stu) Why don't you hang up a minute so we can discuss this matter at length. 
STU It's long distance.  I can't lose the call -- I might not get them back. 
LEON Do I have to rip that fucking phone out of there? 
STU That wouldn't be a good idea. (into pay phone) Would it? 
VOICE Not at all. 
STU I gave you everything I've got. 
LEON That pinky ring looks attractive. Felicia might like that. 
FELICIA It might fit. 
STU You want the ring, you've got the ring.  If I can get it off. 
LEON I can get it off you. 
Leon reaches in and grabs Stu's ring hand. 
STU Let go of me!  It's coming loose. There. (he tosses it) Okay, Felicia, with my deepest apologies.  Goodbye now. 
LEON What's really going on in that booth -- that escapes the naked eye? 
STU Nothing.  Talk.  That's all. 
LEON That your connection on the end of the line?  Or are you dealing? 
STU This has nothing to do with drugs. 
LEON You gotta be high on something to willingly divest yourself of your valuables -- just to maintain occupancy of a fucking phone booth that the local bums piss in every night. 
STU I knew it smelled for some reason. 
LEON You look like you're ready to piss yourself. 
STU Because I am. 
LEON Maybe if the city provided decent public toilets, folks wouldn't relieve themselves in the subway stations and phone booths! 
STU I'll take it up with the mayor. 
LEON Next thing you know you're gonna claim we mugged you -- took your billfold and watch. 
STU No, you didn't.  It was a fair and equitable deal.  You had territorial rights to this booth and I paid a license fee.  Fair is fair.  Now leave me in peace. 
LEON You sure you're alright? (to Felicia) He don't look well. 
FELICIA Kind of pale.  Even for a white man. 
LEON Jaundice they calls it.  Probably advanced liver trouble. (to Stu) If it's cirrhosis, you better find yourself a twelve step program and quick. 
STU Thanks for your interest but I'm in perfect health. 
FELICIA So how come his hand is shaking? 
LEON The man is cracking up.

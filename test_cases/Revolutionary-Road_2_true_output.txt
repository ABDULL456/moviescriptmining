Frank laughs. 
John smiles his yellow grin. 
MR. GIVINGS Sorry, Frank. 
FRANK Don't be. I agree with everything you said, John. We both do. That's why I'm quitting the job in the fall and we're taking off. 
APRIL We're moving to Paris. 
John looks over at his mother. 
JOHN Did you know about this, Ma...? Wow. How do you feel about that, Ma? The nice young Wheelers are taking off! 
John bursts into a painful braying laugh.   It goes on and on. 
Mrs. Givings brings a hand to her brow - she's on the verge of tears. 
MRS. GIVINGS ...John, please. 
MR. GIVINGS Steady down, son. 
April looks at Frank - the whole thing is in danger of going off the rails. 
FRANK How about some fresh air, John? 
John stops laughing abruptly.    He looks to his parents. 
FRANK (CONT'D) If that's all right with you? 
MRS. GIVINGS I don't know if it's a good idea. 
MR. GIVINGS ...If John wants to, I don't see the harm. 
EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY. 
Frank, April and John walk through the woods. 
The ground is freshly rained on and damp.    The sun is bright. 
John buttons up his top button and pulls his sleeves down over his hands. 
APRIL I hear you're a mathematician. 
JOHN You hear wrong.     It's all gone now. 
APRIL All gone? 
JOHN You know what electrical shock treatments are? 
APRIL Yes.   Yes I do. 
JOHN I've had thirty-seven. 
He pushes his hat back and turns his head at April. 
JOHN (CONT'D) See? 
There are scars on his forehead.       April can see them. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Supposed to jolt out the `Emotional Problems.' Just jolted out the mathematics. 
APRIL How awful. 
JOHN (mimicking) `How awful...' Why, because mathematics is so `interesting?' 
APRIL No. Because the shocks must be awful and... well, because it's awful not to be able to do what it is you want to do. I think mathematics are dull.

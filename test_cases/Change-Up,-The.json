{"train": "THE CHANGE-UP \nWritten by \nJon Lucas & Scott Moore \nJuly 31, 2009 \nOPEN ON: PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then a second baby joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: \nGROGGY WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Your turn. \nGROGGY MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Fuck. \nINT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT \nDAVE LOCKWOOD, 30, bleary-eyed father of three, shuffles through his well-appointed suburban home, passing a grandfather clock reading 3:45. He stumbles over a TOY GIRAFFE -- it SQUEAKS, and Dave sleepily mumbles: \nDAVE Sorry Hank. \nINT. NURSERY-- NIGHT \nHis eyes half-open, Dave changes the diaper of his very cute, very insane nine month old daughter, SARAH, who screams and pitches about her changing table. \nDAVE \nPLEASE DON'T-- Honey, that's not-- Maybe if you-- She snatches a tin of baby powder and swings it about like a mace, knocking over the diaper caddy, the wipes, the lotion -- and dispersing a cloud of white powder all over the nursery. Blinded and SNEEZING, Dave manages to stay on point and change the diaper like Van Damme at the end of Bloodsport. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Can't-see ...must...persevere... He finishes changing Sarah, places her back in her crib, then picks up Sarah's twin brother, PETER, from his crib -- which is good because he's been SLAMMING his head against the wall. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Come on, buddy, we've talked about the head thing-- Dave places Peter on the changing table and opens his diaper. It's only wet, and Dave, pleasantly relieved, reaches for a fresh diaper... \nOnly Sarah has knocked the caddy all the way down the changing table... Holding down Peter with his left hand, Dave fully extends, leaning waaay over, reaching for the diaper caddy... It's just out of reach.. .he somehow stretches further... It's only when Dave glances back that he realizes that his head is now perfectly lined up with his son's QUIVERING ANUS. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Oh no. \nTHE BABY'S BUTT-HOLE ERUPTS with mustardy projectile stool, blasting Dave in the eyes, nose and open mouth. Dave remains frozen, excrement dripping down his face -- but, like a true dad, he does not let go of his squirming child... \nINT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nDave staggers down the hall, his hair white with baby powder, his face covered in poo, and a twin in each arm SCREAMING into each of his ears. He soldiers on, stoic, an unsung hero in his time... \nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nJuggling the twins in his arms, Dave wipes his face off with paper towels and prepares two baby bottles -- nipples, filters, defrosted breastmilk -- while the babies take turns kicking him in the balls and SCREAMING. \nDAVE Please, sweetheart, not my-- Honey, Daddy needs those-- \nINT. DEN -- NIGHT \nDave sits on his couch and positions the screaming, squirming twins across his lap in an X pattern, plunks the bottles into their mouths -- and instantly the twins settle down and slurp away like perfect little angels. Dave exhales. Whew. Then he reaches for the remote control and turns on the TV. An old rerun of Magnum, P.I. is playing. Dave watches, exhausted and expressionless. \nON SCREEN, Tom Selleck, resplendent in mustache, corduroy short shorts, and Hawaiian shirt, teaches a nubile CO-ED in a scandalous bikini how to snorkel in beautiful sun-drenched Waikiki. They're laughing and having a blast... Dave watches, detached... Then his face starts to change... \nMAGNUM, P.I. Is this the life you always dreamed of? Dave shakes his head, no, despair in his eyes... ON TV, the co-ed nods, yes, and hungrily kisses Magnum... Dave watches on with genuine existential longing... and soon a tear falls from his eye. And then another. \nDAVE Take me with you Magnum P. I... Before long Dave is CRYING like a schoolgirl. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Please take me with you... \nCUT TO: \nMAN'S VOICE (V.0.) How are the kids? \nDAVE (V.0.) Terrific! Just terrific. We are now \nINT. STEEL, KUHBACH, MCCLOUD -- LAW FIRM -- MORNING \nDave, in a conservative suit and clutching a massive coffee, hurries down the hall with FLEMMING STEEL III, 50's, stiff, humorless WASPY partner of this white shoe law firm. \nFLEMMING STEEL III Children are such a joy. \nDAVE Aren't they? Yes. Always. (to passing SECRETARY) Good morning, Rebecca. \nMITCH I found a futon on the street. \nDAVE That is great news. \nMITCH I sort of had to fight a bum for it -- is that bad? \nDAVE Kind of. Is there a reason you're calling or--? \nMITCH Are you gonna bitch out on tonight? You are, aren't you. Dave, half-listening, sits at his desk and answers emails. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Dodgers-Giants, dude! We haven't missed one of these in like 20 years! Don't be a vajeen! \nDAVE Dude, I'm coming-- \nMITCH You always do this! You never make time for your friends anymore and I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but people are starting to talk. Feelings are getting hurt. \nDAVE Really? Whose feelings? \nMITCH Not mine, because, like a samurai, I have trained myself to feel nothing except revenge and honor, but other people -- nameless, other, more sensitive people -- are hurt, and they think you need to treasure your friendships a little bit more. (exhaling massive bong rip) How concerned should I be that my new futon smells like death? \nDAVE (distracted, typing) Look, just, what time are you picking me up tonight? \nMITCH If you bail I will rape you. \nDAVE Dude, I get it, I'm coming-- \nMITCH In your eye. I will eye-rape you. \nREPEATEDLY-- Just then there's a knock on Mitch's apartment door. \nVOICE AT HIS DOOR (V.0.) Mitch? \nMITCH Shit. Mitch starts waving away the pot smoke. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Gotta go, pick you up at six--! \nSTAY WITH MITCH as he quickly clicks off his iPhone, jams his bong under the futon, opens the window, and tries to blow the pot smoke out of his apartment with quick little PUFFS. \nMITCH (CONT'D) One sec, Dad! The smoke clears and Mitch jogs to the door and opens it to reveal his father, MITCH, SR., 60's, friendly, in a suit, holding a pile of mail. \nMITCH, SR. Hey, buddy! Your mailbox was spilling over. \nMITCH Oh thanks, I always forget. They hug, and Mitch takes the mail and, without looking at it, chucks it onto a HUGE PILE OF OLD MAIL in the corner. \nMITCH, SR. Were you smoking marijuana in here? \nMITCH No! Honestly, it's my new futon, it smells like illegal drugs. \nMITCH, SR. We've talked about this, Mitch. Smoke your grass on the balcony, okay? It's just hard for me to tell the other tenants they can't smoke in their units when my own son is blazing away in his, you know? \nMITCH You got it, Dad. \nMITCH, SR. Oh hey, I saw your commercial on channel 9 again last night... \nMITCH Which one? \"Give Gonorrhea The Boot\" or \"Samir's Pet Shack Our Low Low Prices Are Snake-sational?\" \nMITCH, SR. Samir's Pet Shack. It's just a shame you can't see your face in that giant ape costume. \nMITCH Actually, the real shame is that Samir paid me in fucking organic bird seed, but whatever... He glares at several crates of BIRD SEED by the door. \nMITCH, SR. Well, your mother would've liked it. She always loved animals... \n(AWKWARD MOMENT) Anyway. I was just in the neighborhood, wanted to check in. How you doing, cash-wise? \nMITCH I'm a little tight, actually, Pops. Especially vis a vis, you know, the whole bird seed situation. \nMITCH, SR. Five hundred? \nMITCH Can you make it a grand? Mitch's dad smiles to hide his disappointment and hands his 30-year-old son a roll of hundred dollar bills. \nMITCH, SR. You thought any more about coming to work for me? \nMITCH Yeeeah...I'm not really sure I'm a \"work\" guy, you know what I mean? Plus, I've been getting a ton of auditions recently, so... \nMITCH Who's number two? Fergie--? \nDAVE Just finish your story, man! I'm dying over here! \nMITCH Fine. So Tatiana's packing double E's, which means like 20 plus pounds of breastmeat -- yeah, it's almost too much for one man to handle. Thank God I'm the son of a butcher and have strong hands and wrists. Anyway, she walks in wearing this tight black dress, and you know what she says to me? Dave shakes his head, on the edge of his bar stool. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Nothing. Because all Tatiana wants to do at 3 in the morning is fucky fucky rubber ducky! Dave drunkenly slaps him ten, barely making hand-contact. \nMITCH (CONT'D) And look, I'm not one to kiss and tell... (downing another shot) but this chick is insatiable. She wants it in every position: Missionary, wheelbarrow, Reverse Wheelbarrow, Assassin-- \nDAVE I don't even know what those are! \nMITCH No one does! It gets so intense that my nose starts bleeding. Yeah, so I'm bleeding all over this chick and she's fucking digging it. \n(MORE) \nMITCH (CONT'D) It's like some weird Dracula Anne Rice shit, and I'm fading in and out of consciousness, and then, when it's all over, she turns to me and goes: \"Tuesday night I'm coming back and we're really going to fuck.\" Dave just stares at him, glassy-eyed, drunk, emotional. \nDAVE That is maybe the single greatest story I've ever heard in my life. \nMITCH Ah, it's not always like that... \nDAVE I don't know why...I don't know why I've always been in such a rush, you know? \nMITCH \nWHAT \n(BURRRRP) do you mean? \nDAVE You remember me in high school, I was always so focussed on getting into a good college, then when I got to college, I was so focussed on getting into a good law school, then in law school I was just trying to land a job at a good firm, then Jamie and I got married and we had Cara right away-- I just feel like and I missed out on all the fun stuff, you know? The sex, the drugs, the bad choices, and now it's too late. I blew it. I pissed away my 20's, and now I'm staring down the barrel a seriously boring life. \nMITCH Oh come on, Jamie is hot! \nDAVE No, I know-- \nMITCH I really want to have sex with her! \nDAVE Wait, what? \nMITCH And your kids are adorable! They're like fun little puppies that talk! The bill comes. Dave pulls out a wad of cash, throws it on the table, and stumbles for the door. Mitch lifts one of Dave's twenties off the table and follows him out... \nEXT. SPORTSBAR -- CONTINUOUS \nThey stumble down the dark Hollywood street together... \nDAVE Don't get me wrong, I love my kids, I do, I would take a bullet for them, but...remember that heroin addict you dated? \nMITCH Tara? Or Rena? Or Rachel? \nDAVE Jesus, how many heroin addicts have you dated? \nMITCH It's a national scourge, dude. \nDAVE Anyway. Having kids is like dating a heroin addict, only instead of dating them, they move into your house for 18 years. They're laughing one second and crying the next and then they're trying to kill themselves in your bathroom for no reason. They're mean and selfish and they burn through all your money and they steal your shit and they break everything and they stay up all night and they listen to really shitty music and the dirty secret is, no one actually likes kids. \nMITCH Oh come on, you don't mean that-- \nDAVE No! It's true. Everyone pretends to like kids because if you don't you look like a huge dick. It's like Drew Barrymore or jazz. No one actually likes them, but if you say that out loud, everybody hates you. \nMITCH Dude, I love Drew Barrymore -- have you seen Boys on the Side? They weave across a LARGE PLAZA, stumbling for Mitch's car. \nDAVE I'm just saying: don't fuck up your life like I did, okay? \nMITCH What are you talking about? You've got it all! You've got a huge house full of food and furniture -- shit, your TV is bigger than my car! You have a great job, you make a shit- ton of money, and people respect you, man! My last job involved an ape costume -- do you know what that does to a man? Dave waves him off, not really hearing him. But Mitch is sincere, heartfelt: \nMITCH (CONT'D) Plus you've got a hot, extremely fuckable wife who cooks and cleans and takes care of all your needs! It's like having a really hot mom who you can also have sex with! \nDAVE Wait, what--? \nMITCH Also you're never lonely, you always have someone to talk to about your day, plus you get to do all the fun gay couple stuff like go to wine country! You think single guys can go to wine country?! No way! They won't even let us in! You're living the dream, dude! What more do you want?! \nDAVE Tatiana! I want Tatiana! I want sex with strange new women and maybe also with Sabrina if she's single and I want to wake up at noon and smoke weed all afternoon and I want to not think about the needs of four other people 24 hours a day and I want to start reading a novel and actually finish it and I want to take a solid shit because I'm not constantly stressed out and I want to learn how to rollerblade and also I really want to pee... \nJAMIE Um, yeah? \nMITCH Did we...?! Panicked, he thrusts his fist like, have sex?! \nJAMIE Are you insane? \nMITCH So why the hell did I wake up in your bed?! \nJAMIE Are you still drunk? \nMITCH Look, just, where's Dave?! \nJAMIE What? \nMITCH Where's fucking Dave?! \nJAMIE Dave is right here! You're Dave! He turns and sees himself in the mirror. Freezes. He is Dave. \nMITCH Oh my God... Oh my God... He slowly touches his new face... \nMITCH (CONT'D) I'm a fucking tool. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- MORNING \nA body lies sprawled on Mitch's futon, out cold. INSANE POUNDING on the door shatters the silence. \nMITCH (O.S.) \nOPEN THE GODDAMN DOOR IMMEDIATELY! The body sits up, groggy and confused -- it is, of course, Dave in Mitch's body. While he looks like Mitch, he moves, talks, and even shuffles to the door exactly like Dave... \nDAVE Mitch...? \nMITCH (O.S.) Fucking open the fucking door! Dave stops, noticing that he's in Mitch's empty apartment. \nDAVE Why am I in your sad apartment-- \nMITCH (O.S.) The door, dude! Open the door! \nDAVE Fine, Jesus, relax-- Dave opens the door to see himself standing there. \nDAVE (CONT'D) What the fuck is this...? Dave backpedals, terrified, as Mitch blows inside, furious. \nMITCH I knew it! \nDAVE \n(FREAKING OUT) Who the hell are you?! And why do you look like me?! Mitch angles Dave over to the mirror on the otherwise barren wall-and Dave sees he's in Mitch's body... Stunned, he slowly touches his new face... his new hair. . .his new body... \nDAVE (CONT'D) Oh my God... \nMITCH I know, dude. \nDAVE I'm a fucking loser... \nMITCH Wait, what? Dave spins, completely awake now: \nDAVE How the fuck did this happen?! \nMITCH How should I know?! Has this ever happened to you before?! \nDAVE What, switching bodies with another human being?! Oh yeah, this shit happens to me like twice a week! \nMITCH Well...I don't want to be you! \nDAVE Oh, you don't want to be me?! No, no, no: I don't want to be you! \nMITCH What's that supposed to mean?! \nDAVE Look, let's just.. .think. How could this have possibly happened...? They pace about the apartment, trying to think... Then: \nMITCH Bingo. Got it. We're dreaming. Dave grabs Mitch's nipple and twists it hard. \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON (beat, deadpan) It's not in the computer. Mitch LUNGES for Carla, but Dave grabs him and wrestles him out of the office. \nMITCH \nYOU ARE EVERYTHING THAT IS WRONG \nWITH THE WORLD--! \nDAVE We'll call you tomorrow! Thank you! \nEXT. DEPARTMENT OF PARKS BUILDING -- DAY \nDave and Mitch exit the Department of Parks building and pace on the sunny sidewalk, their hands on their heads, stunned. \nMITCH This is so fucked... \nDAVE We should just go home and lock the \nDOORS AND-- Mitch's phone rings in Dave's pocket. Dave hesitates, then answers it, fruitlessly trying to sound like Mitch: \nDAVE (CONT'D) This is fucking Mitch? \nMITCH I don't talk like that, dude-- \nDAVE Okay ...Okay...Great...Thank you. \nDave clicks off. \nMITCH Who was that? \nDAVE Marty Green, the producer of Busted Dreams 4. Apparently the guy they cast for Steve Action OD'd last night, and the back-up actor got deported, so, alphabetically, you're the next actor on the list. You got the part, man. Mitch covers his mouth like he just won American Idol. \nMITCH Oh my God! Oh my God! Dreams really do come true--! \n(REALIZING) Wait, no, this sucks! I'm stuck in your fat dad-body! I can't play Steve Action looking like this! \nDAVE (remembering, stunned) Oh my God: and I've got my closing today. \nMITCH What, is that like a big deal? \nDAVE A big--?! Yeah! Whether or not I make partner is riding on this! \nMITCH So what the hell are we gonna do? PANICKED SILENCE. Then Mitch looks at Dave... \nDAVE No. No. We can't just be each other for a day, Mitch! You have no idea how to be a lawyer! \nMITCH Dude, I'm an actor, a human chameleon, I can do lawyer in my fucking sleep! It's you I'm worried about: you can't act for shit! \nDAVE First of all, it's Busted Dreams 4, okay? It's not The Reader. Second of all, I'm a WASP, I've spent my entire life acting happy and no one has ever questioned my performance, okay?! They look at each other, cooling off a bit... \nDAVE (CONT'D) Are...Are we actually considering doing this...? \nMITCH I mean, we have to...right? Both men look highly anxious. Dave glances at the time. \nDAVE All right, well, my meeting starts in 45 minutes. You need to race home, get dressed, then go to my office and find my secretary Gladys- \nMITCH She sounds hot, is she hot? \nDAVE No. Get the merger docs from Gladys and take them to the conference room. All the partners will be there so do not speak to anyone. \nMITCH Really? Because I can vamp-- \nDAVE NO! No vamping! And once the meeting starts, you will continue to say nothing. When a partner asks you for the merger documents, you will silently hand them over, okay? \nMITCH Dude, I get it. Play it big, but maintain my reality-- \nDAVE No! Play it small. Really small. I've spent the last nine months banging out the terms of this deal, all you have to do is hand over the documents. That's it. \nMITCH Dude, that's easy as fuck. Okay, for me, go home, put on some cool clothes, and get to set -- all the info is on my phone. Once you're there, go to Hair & Makeup and memorize your lines and try not to be a total douche to everyone, okay? This is the film industry. Everyone is really cool. They look at each other, very doubtful that this will work... \nMITCH (CONT'D) I'm trusting you, dude... \nDAVE I'm trusting you, too... \nMATCH CUT TO: \nMITCH LOOKING EQUALLY OUT OF PLACE standing in the back of an auditorium as on stage, two dozen 5 year old GIRLS in tutus prance about, rehearsing a ballet. The teacher, MRS. KLEINMAN, fruitlessly tries to direct them. CAMERA FINDS CARA onstage, twirling around -- until a bigger girl, NICOLETTE PETERS, knocks her over. Mrs. Kleinman turns to see Cara splayed out on the ground, trying not to cry. \nBALLET TEACHER Oh Cara, do try to stay on your toes! Let's start again... In the audience, Mitch straightens: what was that...? \nINT. DAVE'S AUDI STATION WAGON -- DAY \nMitch drives Cara home from ballet. She sits shotgun in her tutu, looking small and sad. \nCARA Shouldn't I be sitting in my carseat? \nMITCH Whatever, you're fine -- hey, what's up with that little blonde bitch who knocked you over? She looks a little surprised by her dad's language. \nCARA That's Nicolette Peters. She does that a lot, actually... \nMITCH So why don't you fight back? \nCARA Um, because you told me not to? You said I should strive for verbal resolution. \nMITCH Fuck verbal resolution! Put that whore on her back and shank her! Do you know how to make a shiv? \nCARA What? Mitch lights a cigarette with the car lighter. \nMITCH Listen to me, kid: the world is a cesspool of cruelty and violence. If someone comes at you with a knife, you gotta put their entire fucking family in the morgue, okay? That's called jailyard justice. Because if you don't come back hard on a bitch, your ass is gonna get sold for a pack of Camel Lights and a jello cup, y'understand? Always solve your problems with violence. Always. Cara nods, alarmed. \nCARA O-Okay Daddy...? \nCUT TO: \nDAVE LOOKING DIRECTLY INTO CAMERA He's sitting at a booth in a bar, highly traumatized. \nDAVE I dry-humped a stranger's leg for three hours today... Sitting opposite him, Mitch downs a shot, exhausted. \nMITCH Cry me a river, dude: I dealt with ballet and your ass-hat boss today. \nDAVE Oh no -- what happened at work? \nMITCH Nothing! Nothing. (off Dave's look) I fixed it. (off Dave's look) Okay, but look, it was not my fault! The Japs started peppering me with questions and I had to improvise and then everyone got very emotional and, well... it looks like we're going to court. \nDAVE Oh my God tell me you're kidding. \nMITCH Yeah, your boss was pretty miffed, but then I told him this was all part of my master plan to make more money off our clients-- \nDAVE What. 1 \nMITCH Yeah, turns out that's totally illegal, but the old man was surprisingly cool about it. Dave sits there, speechless. Mitch eats wings. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Hey, your secretary is sort of hot in like a Dame Judi Dench-playing-a- Nazi kind of way. Is she on the fuck team? \nDAVE \n(WEAK) I. .I just want to go home... \nCUT TO: \nDAVE AND MITCH DRIVING IN MITCH'S CAR as the sun sets. The windows are open and the wind is in their hair. They're very much not talking to each other... \nEXT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- EVENING \nDave and Mitch head up Dave's front walk, solemn... \nMITCH What are you gonna tell Jamie? \nDAVE The truth. \nMITCH Can I highly recommend against that? \nINT. MITCH'S HOUSE -- EVENING \nMitch and Dave enter to find Cara running down the stairs in her Dora the Explorer pajamas. Dave smiles and opens his arms, tired and overjoyed to see her... \nDAVE Hey, sugar-bug. .but she passes right by him and hugs Mitch. \nMITCH Dude, you are like the worst husband ever. \nDAVE I have a lot on my plate right now, man! You have no idea! \nMITCH Okay, look, calm down: I can hold down the fort for one night. \nDAVE Are you joking? You worked at my job for one day and you almost got arrested! What are you gonna do to my family?! \nMITCH Dude, the kids are already going to bed. \n(MORE) \nMITCH (CONT'D) I think I can handle watching Two And A Half fucking Men and falling asleep on the couch with the best of 'em. The only roadblock I foresee is: what do I tell Jamie? \nDAVE What do you tell Jamie.. .when? \nMITCH When she wants to have sex tonight. \nDAVE But it's Tuesday. \nMITCH I don't understand. You don't have sex on Tuesdays? A beat. Then Dave starts LAUGHING. It builds. Dave hasn't laughed this hard in a long time. He pats Mitch's cheek. \nDAVE That's adorable. Dave turns and exits the house, still LAUGHING... \nDAVE (CONT'D) You know what, give it a shot. \nMITCH Really?! You want me to bang your wife?? \nDAVE Sure, have at it! Let me know how it goes... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nDave parks Mitch's Fiero on this shady Silver Lake street, glancing at the HOMELESS GUY stumbling by, a bit scared. \nINT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nDave enters Mitch's apartment and flips on the bright overhead light. The white walls are empty. A futon, TV, and four crates of bird seed are all that occupy the living room. \nDAVE Jesus, it's like a Swedish asylum-- \nAnd then Mitch's iPhone RINGS. Dave hesitates, then answers: \nDAVE (CONT'D) Mitch Planko, who the fuck is this? A sexy woman's voice purrs: \nSEXY WOMAN (O.S.) Hiii Mitch, it's Tatiana... Dave straightens, oh shit! \nDAVE Tatiana?! Hi! How, um, how are you? \nTATIANA (O.S.) I'll be better in a few minutes after I fuck you raw. CLICK. She hangs up. Dave freezes, wide-eyed. \nDAVE Oh my God. Oh my God. He quickly dials a number. \nINTERCUT WITH MITCH Sitting on the plush couch with Jamie, eating takeout sushi and watching Two and a Half Men on the huge plasma TV. The phone rings. Mitch sees the caller ID, then answers it. \nMITCH Hey dude, I take back everything I said about Two and a Half Men. This is some edgy shit-- \nDAVE Tatiana is on her way over! \nMITCH Nice. \nDAVE What do you think I should do?! \nMITCH I think you should fuck her, that's what I think you should do. Jamie looks over at Mitch, weirded out; he gets up and crosses into the hallway for some privacy. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Don't blow this for me, dude, she's my Tuesday night regular. \nDAVE But wouldn't I be...sort of... cheating on Jamie? Maybe? \nMITCH No! Cheating is when any part of your penis touches any part of another woman who is not your wife, and last I checked, your wang is safely tucked away in my incredibly lame triple-pleated sport slacks. \nDAVE But my mind is over here, doesn't that count... somehow? \nDAVE Oh my god I can see it kicking. You can, in fact, see the fetus moving around in her belly. \nTATIANA You know what? Fuck you, Mitch. Don't ever call me again. She yanks on her coat and storms out. Dave stammers. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM -- NIGHT \nIt's bedtime. Wearing pajama pants and no shirt, Mitch brushes his teeth and fixes his hair, trying to look sexy. He sucks in his dad-gut in the mirror. \nMITCH Jesus, Dave, it's called a sit-up. Then he sees Jamie's dress land on the bedroom floor, followed by her bra... Mitch exhales: \nMITCH (CONT'D) Holy shit, I'm finally going to fuck Jamie. This is my greatest hour! I hope she likes it weird! Then, IN SLOW MOTION, Jamie enters the bathroom, nude, her hair gently blowing in the wind from an open window. She looks insanely hot. Mitch takes her all in, ravenous... \nMITCH (CONT'D) Oh my God I am going to ruin her-- And then she sits on the can. And starts taking a dump. Mitch's face drops, horrified. \nJAMIE I have to cool it on the Thai food. I've had the shits all day. \nMitch just stares at her, dumbstruck, as we hear the LOOSE CONTENTS OF HER BOWELS empty into the toilet bowl. \nMITCH Oh my GOD. \nJAMIE Seriously -- light a candle. She keeps shitting. It sounds like Niagara Falls. Thunderous. Foregoing the candle, Mitch covers his nose with his forearm and stumbles out of the bathroom, nauseous... \nINT. BEDROOM -- A FEW MOMENTS LATER \nMitch lies in bed, staring wide-eyed at the ceiling, horrified. Jamie slides in bed with him, touches his arm-- \nMITCH \n(RECOILING) \nDON'T FUCKING TOUCH ME! \nJAMIE What is your problem? \nMITCH Look, I am not attracted to you right now, okay?! So just... No means no, all right? No means no... TIGHT ON Jamie rolling over, confused and genuinely hurt... \nTIME DISSOLVE TO: \nPEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then a second baby joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: \nJAMIE (O.S.) Your turn. \nMITCH (O.S.) Mmm? \nJAMIE (O.S.) It's your turn to feed the twins. \nMITCH (O.S.) Yeah...I really don't feel like it. Jamie turns on the light, pissed. \nJAMIE Are you fucking kidding me? \nMITCH No, it's 3 in the morning, you go do it. You're the mother. \nJAMIE Get the fuck out bed right now and go feed your fucking children or I will fucking cut you! Mitch is already scrambling out of the room, terrified. \nMITCH Yes Jamie I'm sorry Jamie! \nINT. TWIN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nMitch just looks at the twins, SCREAMING in their respective cribs, no idea what to do. He reaches for the phone. Dials. \nINTERCUT WITH DAVE in Mitch's apartment, jacking off to some (very small) internet porn on Mitch's iPhone. Then the porn disappears, and \"DAVE LOCKWOOD CALLING\" appears on screen. \nDAVE Oh come on... (answering, panting) What? \nMITCH I always thought your wife was a nice lady but she is neither nice nor a lady! She talks like a dock- worker and she shits like one too! Plus I used to think your kids were adorable but actually they're just really fucking annoying and crazy needy-- Wait, are you jacking off? \nDAVE What? No! \nMITCH So why are you panting? \nDAVE Look, I had to, I never get this kind of privacy anymore. \nDAVE First: attach the filter to the seal to the nipple... Mitch hears CLINK CLINK and spins to see that Sarah has crawled over to the KNIFE BLOCK and removed a BUTCHER KNIFE and a MEAT CLEAVER and is waving them about like rattles! \nMITCH Oh jesus oh jesus... Mitch approaches her, wide-eyed, tentative -- when Sarah giggles and spastically whips the cleaver at him! He barely sidesteps it, and it impacts into a cupboard door -- F-TWANG! \nMITCH (CONT'D) This is so fucked up! \nDAVE I know, right? And make sure you don't allow any air bubbles in. Mitch grabs a pair of tongs and, after a few attempts, snatches the butcher knife from Sarah's hands. Then he scoops her up and deposits her into the sink with her brother. Finally, he slumps over, trying to catch his breath. \nMITCH Dude. Listen to me: you need to go downtown first thing tomorrow morning and you need to find that fucking fountain... He starts pouring cow's milk into the babies' mouths. It splashes all over them, but they manage to lap up some of it. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Honestly, I'm really not sure how much more of this shit I can take. \nCUT TO: \nA DESK PLACARD READING \"DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON\" District Manager Carla Nelson sits behind her desk in her bland, putty office, the next morning. She is still bored. \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON Good news. Your formal information request was approved. Dave stops pacing, deeply relieved. \nDAVE Great. So where's the fountain? \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON Oh. We won't hear back for one to three weeks, maybe more. \nDAVE WHAT? How long can it possibly take you to find your own fountain?! \nCARLA MELSON DAVE One to three weeks, maybe One to three weeks, maybe more. more. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Thanks, Carla, you just ruined my life. Have an awesome day. Dave blows out of there, choking on his fury... \nMATCH CUT TO: \nDAVE RACING INTO HIS OWN HOUSE still furious. He looks around for Mitch. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Mitch?! Mitch?! Bad news, buddy! Dave bounds up the stairs... \nINT. NURSERY -- MORNING \nJamie quietly CRIES as she gets the twins dressed for the day. Dave charges in-- \nDAVE Real bad news--! Jamie startles and quickly dries her eyes. \nJAMIE Dave's in the shower. \nDAVE Are you okay...? Dave enters, concerned, and instinctively starts helping her dress the babies. She watches him, a bit confused. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Come on, you can tell me. We've been friends forever... \nJAMIE \n(EXHALES) It's Dave ...he's been acting so strange lately. Last night... Last night he even told me he wasn't attracted to me... \nDAVE Oh my god I'm going to fucking kill him. \nJAMIE Just tell me honestly...is Dave having an affair? \nDAVE No. Jamie. I swear he's not. You're just going through a very temporary rough patch, okay? \nJAMIE Temporary? We've been in this rough patch for years \nDAVE (this is news to him) Y-You have?! \nJAMIE You don't want to hear about this. \nDAVE No I really do. Tell me everything. Jamie looks at him, sees the urgency in his eyes. Frowns. \nJAMIE It's not his fault, really...I love him with all my heart, you know I do, but-you remember Dave's family growing up. They were a mess. They had nothing. Dave's entire childhood was spent looking over the fence, wanting a better life. So he scrimped and saved and worked four jobs at once and put himself through school and built a better life for himself. I've always loved that about him. \n(MORE) \nJAMIE (CONT'D) No one ever gave him anything. The problem is, now that he's got a good life, he can't turn it off -- he's still looking over the fence, wanting something even better, a second house, more kids, a faster car, a bigger promotion, whatever it is that he thinks will finally make him happy. Dave reddens, defensive; this is hitting very close to home. \nDAVE well poor Jamie! You have an ambitious, hard-working husband who provides for you and your family -- how can you even stand it? \nJAMIE \nINT. DAVE'S AUDI STATION WAGON -- DAY \nThey drive down the street, the car packed with groceries. \nDAVE When you're with Jamie, you should always be doing one of three things: asking her permission, complimenting her, or begging her forgiveness. It doesn't matter if she already said you could go to poker night, or if she looks like fucking Mothra in that dress, or if you didn't do anything wrong. Permission, compliments, apologies. That's all anyone wants to hear out of a husband's mouth. Here, let's practice: what's your favorite joke? \nMITCH Umm...? A rabbi, a priest--? BAM! Dave punches Mitch in the nuts. \nDAVE Trick question! No one fucking cares! You're Dave Lockwood, boring dad, you're not Jerry Fucking Seinfeld! Shut the fuck up! Mitch clutches his balls, hurt and scared... \nINT. PRE-SCHOOL CLASSROOM -- DAY \nDave and Mitch, wearing sombreros, sit behind a tiny desk in this colorful pre-school classroom, preparing the healthy snacks they just purchased for Cara and her rowdy CLASSMATES. \nDAVE These are called children, or dependents. Never disparage your own children -- everything they do is a miracle from God. When they're bad, it's only because they're tired or going through a phase. When other people's kids are bad, however, it's because of indulgent parenting or innate defects in the \nCHILD'S CHARACTER-- A cute little BOY snatches three apple slices. \nDAVE (CONT'D) One a piece, please, Dylan. \n(TO MITCH) Kid's a natural born criminal. If he sees 18, it'll be from the inside a jail cell. \nINT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- DAY \nDave walks Mitch through the office. \nDAVE This is called an office, or work. Think about whatever you most want to do here, and then do the exact opposite. You want to go home early? Great: stay all night. Hungry? Cool: don't eat. Think your boss is a total douche? Terrific: invite him to join your fantasy baseball league. A cute ASSOCIATE walks by and Mitch overtly eye-fucks her all the way past. Dave nut-punches him again. \nDAVE (CONT'D) You're married now, jackass! You can't look at other women, you can't talk to other women, you can't even be interesting around other women! Do everything in your power to de-sexualize yourself -- wear a fannypack, drive a Passat, affix electronic devices to your belt -- whatever it takes. If you're forced to interact with a woman, quickly find a way to mention that you're married. It doesn't even have to make sense. Just be like \"Nice weather today, I'm totally fucking married.\" \nMITCH Wait, so I can't sleep with my wife and I can't sleep with other women? What is that? \nDAVE It's called marriage. Dave turns into his office, nodding at his mean secretary. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Good morning, Gladys. She scowls at him, confused, who's this guy? Then Mitch passes and wiggles his tongue at her, simulating cunnilingus. The old lady GASPS, appalled... \nINT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS \nThey enter Dave's office. \nDAVE Do you have any other questions? \nMITCH Yeah -- when's your free time? \nDAVE (COCK-PUNCHING him again) Have you been listening to one word I've said?! There is no fucking free time! You don't have a life anymore! You don't have a personality, or an identity, or a point of view! You are a dad! \n(MORE) \nDAVE (CONT'D) Your job is to allocate resources, to shuttle children from A to B, to deliver food at appropriate intervals, to clean up, to break down, to construct, to repair, to finance, to sooth, to make everyone else happy, okay? And when your day is done, you know what you get? \nMITCH Dry handjob? \nDAVE Nothing! You're not single anymore! No one gives you a cupcake every time you hold the door or speak in complete sentences, it's expected of you now, so grow up! \nMITCH Okay, can I just say something without you punching my cock? (Dave inhales, go) I think you might be taking some of this adult shit a little seriously-- \nVOICE AT THE DOOR Knock knock? Both men turn to see Sabrina in the doorway, looking lovely in a short skirt suit, holding documents. Mitch straightens. \nMITCH HELL-lo legs. \nSABRINA Yes...um...sort of big news. \nMITCH (solicitous, creepy) Please, come in! Coffee? Scotch? \nSABRINA (entering, tentative) No... thanks? Anyway, Kinkabe and Amalgamated have agreed to go into binding mediation in two days. \nDAVE Two days? Are you kidding me?! Sabrina glances at Dave, confused, no idea who he is. \nSABRINA N-No? Anyway, I'll have my briefs on your desk by tonight. \nMITCH (stretching leg on desk) And I'll have my briefs on your chin by tomorrow morning-- \nDAVE And that is Level 4 Sexual Harassment! Awesome! Thanks, Sabrina, that will be all. \nMITCH, SR. Nothing! Nothing. How are y--? \nMITCH I mean, you still have a really fucking cool son, right?! \nMITCH, SR. Yes, Mitch is definitely cool... How are the twins? \nMITCH They're fucking fine-- what the fuck does that mean, \"Mitch is definitely cool?!\" \nMITCH, SR. \n(TAKEN ABACK) Nothing. No, it's my fault... I spoiled him rotten after his mother passed away, but... He trails off, clearly not wanting to talk about this. \nMITCH But what, dude?! Spit it out! \nMITCH, SR. But now he's a total fuck up. Mitch actually GASPS. His dad smiles sadly: \nMITCH, SR. (CONT'D) I mean, he's a great guy, he's the life of the party, but he has no work ethic, he has no backbone, he'll never build a family or a career or anything of substance like you have. He's... embarrassing. Mitch stands there, mouth agape, just decimated. \nMITCH, SR. (CONT'D) Anyway, I'm sorry to go on and on. How's your lovely wife--? Mitch starts TEARING UP and fumbling with the car door. \nMITCH Your son is not a fuck up, M-Mr. Planko! He's just a late bloomer! His dad looks utterly confused as Mitch gets into the car. \nMITCH, SR. Dave? Are you crying...? \nMITCH I'm sorry, I'm just very close to Mitch and when people say mean things about him I hurt too-- He SLAMS the door shut and jerks out of the parking spot, tears pouring down his face. His dad watches on, bewildered. \nINT. DAVE'S CAR -- NIGHT \nMitch angrily drives home, trying to stop crying. \nMITCH Fuck! Fuck... And then Survivor's \"Eye of the Tiger\" comes on the radio. Mitch's expression slowly turns to steely determination... \nCUT TO: \nBLACK STILLNESS As \"Eye of the Tiger\" continues playing, we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then we hear a second baby join in. Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: \nJAMIE \nYOUR TURN-- \nMitch sits bolt upright in bed like Rambo, totally awake, his jaw set, and bounds out of bed... \nINT. NURSERY -- NIGHT \nMitch aggressively changes the twins' diapers. He's doing a terrible job, but he's focussed, working hard... \nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nMitch assembles two baby bottles as the twins sit in the sink SCREAMING. He SCREAMS back at them... \nINT. DEN -- NIGHT \nMitch sits erect on the couch like a Navajo warrior, feeding the twins, his eyes afire... \nINT. DAVE'S CAR -- THE NEXT MORNING \nWearing fingerless driving gloves, Mitch races the twins to day care. He looks like the fucking Transporter... \nINT. STEEL, KUHBACH, MCCLOUD -- LAW FIRM -- MORNING \nMitch blows into the office, looking sharp in a business suit. He points at other lawyers, amped up, not smiling. \nMITCH \nLET'S DO SOME LAW, GUYS! GET SOME! His old secretary Gladys falls in step with him. \nGLADYS \nGOOD MORN-- \nMITCH I need the book CORPORATE LAW FOR DUMMIES, every season of Law & Order on DVD and Blu-Ray, and the biggest fucking coffee you can carry on my desk in 15 minutes or else you're fired. Gladys writes this down on a pad of paper, a bit turned on... \nMITCH (CONT'D) Also get yourself a new haircut and a pair of six inch stripper shoes. It's time to take this shit to the next level. \nANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN \nDAVE (trying to be sexy) So: what school district do you live in? \nANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN \nDAVE Yikes, what do your parents think of all those piercings?! \nANOTHER YOUNG WOMAN \nDAVE .and that's the difference between a stroller and a pram. \nYOUNG WOMAN My car's ready. The YOUNG WOMAN races off towards her newly cleaned car. Dave slumps, shit. Mitch nods, looking at his watch. \nMITCH Forty seconds. Not bad. Your times are improving. \nDAVE I forgot how hard it is to be single... \nMITCH As a general rule, when you're talking to single women, conversation topics to avoid include: your wife, your children, your favorite playgrounds, and The Wiggles... Dave nods, hating himself. Mitch heads for the Ferrari. \nMITCH (CONT'D) But this was good. You worked out all your bad game and now you're ready to dominate. Come on. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FERRARI -- NIGHT \nMitch rockets down Sunset Boulevard. Dave looks nauseous. \nDAVE I don't feel good about this. \nMITCH Relax: you're dressed cool, your hair is crushing it, your ballsack is taut and smooth, and you're way better looking than you've ever been. Just remember Uncle Mitch's Golden Rule of Dating. \nDAVE I know, always use an alias. \nMITCH What? No. No, my Golden Rule of Dating is always find the fun. Think of it like this: for the next two hours, you're stuck with this chick. Doesn't matter if she's cool or crazy or if she was born with a vagina on her forehead -- you're stuck, so make the most of it. I dated this chick named Topaz once who may or may not have killed her father. Long story short, she looked like 50 miles of bad road and I wasn't interested, but I used our time together to learn about incest and the failures of the American Appellate Court system. I found it hugely informative, and Topaz got caught up in my enthusiasm and gave me a crying blowjob on the car-ride home, so everybody won. The point is: find the fun for yourself and great things will follow. Dave looks horrified as they roll up to RICHTER'S, a chic steakhouse. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Power hug. Mitch hugs a still-speechless Dave... \nMITCH (CONT'D) Now go on. Make daddy proud. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RICHTER'S RESTAURANT -- A SHORT WHILE LATER \nRichter's is dark, elegant, romantic. Dave sits at a candle- lit table, anxiously folding and unfolding sugar packets. Then Sabrina enters, looking stunning in a snug red dress, and gazes around the restaurant. Dave's heart skips a beat, and he waves her over. She approaches, smiling. \nSABRINA Hey! \nDAVE Hey. Hi. Hello. He awkwardly goes to kiss her cheek while she goes for a handshake. It's awkward/cute. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Oh -- whoop -- okay. They sit. Dave stares at her, terrified. Then he blurts out: \nDAVE (CONT'D) Do you like Googoo Lady?! \nSABRINA What. . .what is that? \nDAVE I-I don't know! I really don't! Sabrina smiles politely and looks around for a waiter. Dave winces, hating himself to the very core of his being... \nSABRINA So. How long have you known Dave? \nDAVE M-My whole life, actually. \nSABRINA Annnd have you ever seen him act like he did yesterday? \nDAVE What, like a total douchebag? She LAUGHS. Dave can't believe it. He loosens up a bit. \nDAVE (CONT'D) That's not fair. Dave...Dave isn't himself right now. I hope he didn't say anything to offend you... \nSABRINA No. I mean, he totally did, but it's fine. I have brothers. Dave pours both of them a glass of wine, finding his rhythm. \nDAVE So. You like working with Dave? \nSABRINA I love it. He's the best. \nSABRINA Good night, Mitch. \nShe gives him a thoughtful smile then disappears inside. Dave waits a second, then does a victorious karate chop, YES! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA BEAUTIFUL SUNNY MORNING Light floods into Mitch's apartment. Dave wakes up and looks at the clock: 9:02. \nDAVE Fuck that. He rolls over and goes back to sleep, a smile on his face... \nEXT. TOAST -- DAY \nDave sits at an outdoor table, reading a novel and taking his time with brunch. He sees a BUSINESSMAN wolfing down his food and running off to his car, yelling into his cell phone, stressed out of his mind. Dave smiles and keeps reading... \nINT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- DAY \nDave sits on the toilet, reading his novel and taking a leisurely shit. We hear the clean KER-PLOP of a solid poo hitting the toilet water, and Dave closes his eyes, nice... \nEXT. BATTING CAGES -- DAY \nDave, in a Dodgers jersey, tees off on baseballs in a batting cage. CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! It feels great... \nEXT. JUNGLE -- MOVIE SET -- DAY \nDave, holding a cross-bow and wearing a loincloth, has fake sex with his CO-STAR on a jungle set; their mid-sections are conveniently obscured by a giant fern. Dave is selling it, and when Valtan calls cut, the whole CREW applauds, wildly impressed. Dave waves them off, bashful... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- DAY \nLooking hip in jeans, flip flops, and a mildly ironic tee shirt, Dave breezes into his office to find Mitch, in a pressed suit, intently studying a legal casebook at his desk. \nDAVE Well, well, look who's all growns up. \nDave crashes on the couch, happy. Mitch looks annoyed: \nMITCH Really? Open-toed sandals at work? \nDAVE Are...Are you kidding me? \nMITCH Look, I can't hang right now, okay? I've got the mediation in like ten minutes. Dave stands right back up, surprised and impressed. \nDAVE Wow. Okay. Well, I just wanted t tell you that if you can get a protracted buyout for anything over 700 million dollars, take it, okay? \nMITCH 700 million, you got it. \nDAVE (heading for the door) Also, I wanted to thank you for setting me up with Sabrina. She's amazing. I can't wait to see her \nAGAIN TONIGHT-- \nMITCH What?! Dave: No. You can't, you have to wait at least a week! Dave reaches for his cellphone as he heads out the door. \nDAVE Which reminds me, I wanted to call to see if she got the flowers... \nMITCH You sent her flowers after one date?! Are you retarded?! Do not get me into a relationship, dude! Too late. Dave is already gone. Mitch scowls. Then: \nMITCH (CONT'D) You can come out now, Gladys... A second later, GLADYS, in a form-fitting suit and a sexy new bob, crawls out from under his desk. Mitch zips up his pants. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Look, honey, I don't think this is \nWORKING OUT-- Gladys YANKS him by the tie and gets in his face, wild-eyed: \nGLADYS I haven't had sex in 34 years! This isn't over tit I su e' it's over. \nMITCH F-Fine, but can you please stop following me to the bathroom and calling my house late at night and sending me all those filthy emails? It's, you know, deeply disturbing. \nGLADYS You need to realize something, boy: (whispering in his ear) I fucking own you now. The old lady aggressively makes out with Mitch. Her tongue roams from his mouth and madly licks his face, neck, and forehead. Eventually they separate. Mitch looks stunned. \nGLADYS (CONT'D) I left you a little souvenir in your pocket... She winks and exits. Mitch tentatively reaches into his pocket and pulls out a giant pair of TAN GRANNY PANTIES. \nMITCH I've created a monster... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMITCH Fuck it. Helping ridiculously rich people become even more ridiculously rich is why I go to work every day. \nCEO TED NORTON Well, you are bar none the best attorney I've ever worked with! \nMITCH I am?! Fuck, I've never really been good at anything before... Mitch considers this a second, then laughs, proud. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Gimme me a hug you tiny capitalist! Mitch hugs Ted and lifts him off the ground, spinning him. \nMITCH (CONT'D) I love you so much... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DODGERS STADIUM -- DAY \nA perfect, sunny day game at Dodgers stadium. Dave and Sabrina take their seats behind home plate. \nDAVE \n(AMAZED) These are your grandfather's seats? \nSABRINA Yeah, my family's been coming to Dodger games since they moved here from Brooklyn in '58. Dave looks at her, his amazement only growing... \nDAVE Really? Who's your favorite Dodger? \nSABRINA Fernando, obviously. \nBlown away, Dave unzips his jacket to reveal a throwback number 34 Fernando Valenzuela jersey. She laughs. \nSABRINA (CONT'D) No way! \nDAVE It's too soon to say I love you, right? That's against the rules? she laughs and kisses him. \nSABRINA You're cute. Smiling, Dave looks out at the perfect ball field, his arm around Sabrina-he looks profoundly... existentially.. .happy. And then his iPhone RINGS. He answers it: \nDAVE Mitch Planko who the fuck is this. \nINTERCUT WITH: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON sitting at her desk, talking on the phone and doing WHIPPETS off a can of Reddi-Wip; twenty empty cans litter her desk. \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON This is Carla Nelson from the Los Angeles Department of Parks. \nDAVE Oh my God, hi! Dave steps away to take the call. Carla does another whippet. \nDAVE (CONT'D) What's.. .going on? \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON We found that fountain. It's in our San Pedro warehouse. Dave glances back at Sabrina... and winces, conflicted: \nDAVE And... and how long is it going to be there? \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON It ships out tonight for repairs. \nDAVE And after that? \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON (doing another whippet) No fucking clue, dude. Dave gets a CALL WAITING BEEP. \nDAVE Right. Okay, well thanks, Carla. (clicking over to other line) Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH: MITCH He's walking down the hall of his law firm, on the phone, as all of his peers step from their offices, APPLAUDING his victory, slapping him on the back, shaking his hand. \nMITCH You hear about the fountain? \nDAVE Yeah... We should probably switch back, huh? Mitch high-fives a co-worker. \nMITCH Sure. Right. I mean... the funny thing is...I was just starting to enjoy your life a little bit... \nDAVE Yeah, and I was just starting to enjoy yours, too... \nMITCH Really? \nDAVE Really. \nMITCH So.. .maybe we should keep going--? \nDAVE I'm so glad you said that. \nRain pours down outside. Then Dave and Sabrina, soaking wet in their Dodgers gear, run into the apartment. \nSABRINA Oh my god, I'm soaking-- (taking in barren apartment) Wait, are you a single guy? Dave laughs and throws her a towel from the bathroom. She starts drying her hair. \nSABRINA (CONT'D) I need a beer and some dry clothes. When Dave passes her, though, she stops him, and starts kissing him... \nSABRINA (CONT'D) Or maybe...mmm...maybe just a beer. \nCUT BACK TO: \nINT. CUT RESTAURANT -- MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nMitch stands in the restaurant's upscale men's room, staring at himself in the mirror, lost... \nMITCH What am I doing...? This isn't my life... \nVOICE Good evening, Mr. Lockwood... He spins to see Gladys in the doorway, vamping, sexy... \nMITCH Oh no. Gladys, not now-- \nGLADYS (approaching, coy) I'm not wearing any bloomers... \nMITCH I thought we talked about not using \nTHAT WORD-- WHAM! She throws him against the bathroom wall and starts aggressively undressing him. \nGLADYS What's bothering you, Mr. Lockwood? \nMITCH Look, Gladys, I love bathroom sex as much as the next guy, but-- She SPITS in his face, crazy-eyed. \nGLADYS \nTELL ME WHAT'S BOTHERING YOU! \nMITCH (wiping face, a bit scared) O-Okay? Well, I guess what's bothering me is...I didn't earn any of this, you know? Gladys rips open his shirt and starts licking his chest downward until she disappears OUT OF FRAME. \nMITCH (CONT'D) And I know what you're thinking: Mitch, not earning things never used to bother you, why does it bother you now? And the answer is: maybe I'm growing up. We hear the sound of his pants UNZIPPING... \nMITCH (CONT'D) I mean, sure, I closed the deal today, and that felt good, but I didn't put in all the years of hard work that got Dave to this point, you know? Plus, those aren't my adorable kids, that's not my beautiful wife, you're not even my freaky deaky old lady secretary. I want to earn this stuff-- Just then FLEMMING STEEL III BLOWS IN -- and stops cold: \nFLEMMING STEEL III \nGOOD GOD MAN! GO WIDE to see that Gladys is in the Reverse Wheelbarrow position, her palms on the bathroom floor, her feet against the bathroom wall, with Mitch between her legs, his pants around his ankles. Mitch sees his boss -- and freezes. \nMITCH Uh oh. \nFLEMMING STEEL III \nTHE REVERSE WHEELBARROW?. Mitch and Gladys disengage and straighten themselves. \nMITCH Sir, it's not my fault--! \nFLEMMING STEEL III Have you forgotten everything you learned in law school?! You can't screw a direct hire! How can we possibly make you a partner now?! You're completely exposed--! We hear a GASP from the doorway. Everyone turns to see Jamie -- she's heard the whole thing. Mitch quickly zips his pants. \nJAMIE I thought you might be having an affair... but not with Gladys: \nGLADYS Age-ist. \nMITCH Jamie, you gotta believe me, this woman is a predator--! \nJAMIE You know what? No. I can't do this anymore. I want you out of the house by the time the kids wake up. \nMITCH Jamie--! Too late. She runs off, choking back tears... \nEXT. CUT RESTAURANT -- NIGHT \nFastening his belt, Mitch sprints out of the restaurant, desperate -- but Jamie is already SQUEALING away in her car. \nMITCH FUCK! Fuck... He stands in the rain, overcome with self-loathing... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nMITCH It's... confusing grown-up stuff-- \nCARA Try me. \nMITCH O-Okay? Well. I'm leaving because I'm a fuck up. Do you know what a fuck up is? \nCARA \n(NODDING) Like Uncle Mitch. \nMITCH Right. Right. Well, I thought this time was different, you know? I thought I actually did something right for once. But no, I'm still the same old fuck up I've always been. Only this time I really fucking fucked up, because I fucked up my life and my best friend's life... Mitch zips up his bag, full of regret -- and finds Cara hugging his leg. \nCARA I don't think you're a fuck up. He crouches down and looks at her, getting choked up... \nMITCH Thanks, sweetie, but your brain is the size of a radish. I am a fuck up. I always have been, and I always will be. Guys like me, we know how to have fun, but we don't know how to do the important stuff, you know...? Be good, okay, kiddo? She nods, confused. He kisses her head and exits, emotional. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BMW STATION WAGON -- NIGHT \nThe rain still pours down. Jamie, tears streaking her face, drives home in stop-and-go traffic. Then, through her side window, we see Dave sprinting alongside her car, waving! \nDAVE \nJAMIE! Not seeing him, she accelerates forward and Dave disappears from view. . .until she stops, and Dave catches up again: \nDAVE (CONT'D) \nJAMIE! Still not seeing him, Jamie accelerates onto \nTHE 101 FREEWAY where the stop-and-go traffic moves only slightly faster. Jamie continues quietly CRYING to herself... Then we see \nDAVE RUNNING ALONG THE SHOULDER OF THE 101 in the driving rain, waving his hands and yelling! \nDAVE \nJESUS JAMIE! LOOK RIGHT! Finally, she glances over, sees Dave -- and startles: \nJAMIE Mitch? \nDAVE \nPLEASE PULL OVER BEFORE I DIE! Jamie, stunned, pulls onto the shoulder and stops. A second later, Dave hops into the car, soaking wet and panting. \nJAMIE What is the matter with you?! \nDAVE Look, I know I haven't been a very good husband or father recently... \nJAMIE What are you talking about--? \nDAVE But I'm done looking over the fence for something better. I've seen what's on the other side, and it's great. . .and young... and supple... but it's not you. And the truth is there will always be another fence with shinier toys on the other side, but the only way to be happy is to say fuck the fence and just appreciate what you have, you know? Find the fun with what you got... \nJAMIE O-Okay? \nDAVE I'm so sorry I stopped appreciating you, pumpkin. I love you. And I love our weird little kids. And I can't believe I ever thought that wasn't enough. \nJAMIE Why...are you calling me pumpkin? And then he kisses her. She resists-- \nJAMIE (CONT'D) Mitch--?. But he holds her firm. And soon she's kissing him back, confused and overwhelmed and crying... It's emotional and intense for him, too. They finally separate, but remain inches apart, breathing hard. \nJamie stares into his eyes, amazed: \nJAMIE (CONT'D) Dave? Dave nods. Jamie squints, trying to understand. \nJAMIE (CONT'D) But...how? Dave shakes his head, I don't know... \nJAMIE (CONT'D) So...then ...Mitch was the one... with Gladys? Dave nods again. Jamie looks relieved... Then she stops. \nJAMIE (CONT'D) Wait, so who was that hot young thing back in the apartment? \nDAVE Nothing happened, I swear. \nJAMIE Okay. But-we're going to need to talk about this. \nMITCH Yes. We have to pee in it. \nDAVE It's a magic fountain. The workmen just look at them, deadpan. Then Dave reaches into his wallet and starts pulling out CASH-- \nSMASH CUT TO: \nMITCH AND DAVE STANDING SIDE BY SIDE AT THE FOUNTAIN with their pants down around their ankles. Dave starts PEEING. Mitch doesn't. Dave hisses at him: \nDAVE Come on, open the floodgates! \nMITCH I can't pee with them watching! PAN OVER to the workmen, standing nearby, looking at Mitch and Dave like they're total freaks. \nDAVE Well I can't keep going forever! Mitch tilts his head back and quietly sings to himself: \nMITCH The sun is shining all the time, Looks like another perfect day, I love L.A. We love it! I love L.A... \nDAVE Are you singing Randy Newman--? Then we hear a second stream of PEE hit the fountain. \nMITCH Oh thank god. \nDAVE Okay, quick, we have to hug! \nMITCH (glancing back at workmen) Do we, though? \nDAVE Yes, we have to do everything exactly the same! Come on! As they scootch together and put their arms around each other, Mitch calls over to the workmen: \nMITCH Just so you know, this isn't gay! Our penises aren't even touching--! \nDAVE Come on: \"I wish I had my old life back\" on three! One, two: \nMITCH DAVE I wish I had my old life I wish I had my old life back! back! \nJUST THEN A THUNDER CLAP CRASHES OUTSIDE The lights in the warehouse flicker. Dave and Mitch finish peeing and slowly zip up, exchanging a worried look... \nDAVE You think it worked? \nMITCH How the fuck should I know? (waving to workmen) Thank you! Have a pleasant evening! \nCUT TO: \nPEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then we hear a second baby join in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: \nJAMIE (O.S.) Your turn. \nFOLLOWED BY: \nDAVE (O.S.) \nYES! Dave turns on the light, rushes over to the mirror, and touches his face, overjoyed, clearly back in the right body. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Oh thank God. Thank God. Pumpkin, it worked! I'm back! \nJAMIE (groggy, half-asleep) Great, go feed the fucking babies. She rolls over and goes back to sleep. He grins and runs out. \nINT. NURSERY -- NIGHT \nDave cheerfully sings as he changes Sarah's diaper. \nDAVE You just vomited on my hand but I love yooooou... \nINT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nDave bounces down the hallway, a twin in each arm, SCREAMING into each of his ears and taking turns kicking his balls... and he's grinning. In fact, he couldn't look happier. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- MORNING \nMitch slowly wakes up in his empty apartment. He stares at the blank walls, a little bummed... Then he startles when SABRINA rolls over, looking ravishing. \nSABRINA Last night was weird. \nMITCH Wasn't it? \n", "test1_input": "MITCH (CONT'D) You look hot by the way, Jame. Jamie laughs but clearly doesn't mind the flirtation. \nJAMIE Thanks... sort of...? \nMITCH No really. I never would've guessed twins. \nJAMIE Annnd that's probably enough-- \nMITCH Is Dave still meeting your needs sexually? Jamie just laughs, shaking her head, unbelievable. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Oh, did I tell you I ran into Miss Hickam last week at Starbucks? \nJAMIE Our old kindergarten teacher?! \nMITCH Yeah. She always liked Dave better than me... \nJAMIE Honey, everyone likes Dave better than you. \nMITCH Fair enough. Anyway, I tried to get her number, but she goes \"I don't date former students,\" so I go, \"great, do you fuck former students?\" and then she calls me a \"potty-mouth degenerate\" and runs out without her coffee. So I got a free venti macchiato, which is cool- \nDAVE (O.S.) Bathed, changed and in their Pis. Mitch turns to see Dave in khakis and a buttondown, entering the kitchen with the freshly bathed twins. Mitch grins: \nMITCH Awww! Come to Uncle Mitch... Dave hands the twins to Mitch, and they COO, impishly cute. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Oh my God, they smell like heaven had sex with a dryer sheet. (loudly to babies) \nHI! WHAT'S YOUR NAME?! WHICH ONE \nARE YOU?! (they just GURGLE) Why can't they talk yet? Are they retarded or something? \nJAMIE \n(LAUGHING) What?! No! They're fine! \nMITCH Really? The one on the left looks a little downsy. \n(JAMIE GASPS) Kidding! Kidding. (aside, to Dave) A little bit though, right? Ignoring him, Dave fastens the twins into their Bouncy Seats. \nDAVE I'll be back right after the game, okay, Pumpkin? \nJAMIE Whenever. Have fun. \nMITCH See you, Jame! \nJAMIE Always a pleasure, Mitch. Mitch steals THREE PEARS and some TULIPS as he exits... \nCUT TO: \nTWO BEERS POPPING OPEN on the bottle cap-opener mounted on Mitch's dashboard... \nINT. MITCH'S CAR -- EVENING \nMitch offers Dave one of (his own) beers as they speed along in his Fiero. Dave is reluctant. \nDAVE Yeah, I'm good. \nMITCH Really? You're going to make me drink alone? \nDAVE Yeah, well, you're driving, so... Mitch shrugs and slides the spare beer into his chest pocket. \nMITCH Oh, dude: great news. \nDAVE You found another futon? \nMITCH That's awesome, because I'm made of emotional Teflon and words can't hurt me anymore. No: I auditioned for a major movie role yesterday. \nDAVE Nice. What movie? \nMITCH It's called Busted Dreams 4. It's about a renegade coroner who reads minds named Jake Action. It's like a sexy Mentalist. \nDAVE Sounds cool. \nMITCH Yeah, I read for the part of Steve Action, Jake's troubled younger brother with a secret, and I fucking killed it. I cried like five times during the audition and it's a fucking action movie. Plus I'm the spitting image of the dude who plays Jake Action, so... \n", "test1_true": "MITCH Yeah, it could be my Raging Bull. Plus I'd get to kill a lot of women, which is cool. (offering him a joint) Hotbox? \nDAVE No, man, I got a big day tomorrow, I can't get wasted tonight. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nTWO SHOT GLASSES SLAMMING DOWN Mitch and Dave, shit-faced, shake off their shots, B-R-R-R. \nINT. BIG WANGS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT \nThe guys sit in this crowded sports bar, watching the Dodgers game on a huge TV. When CLAYTON KERSHAW strikes out FRED LEWIS to win the game, the guys drunkenly slap five: \nDAVE \nMITCH \nDAVE \nMITCH Change-up -- fuck he's good! \nDAVE He's no Fernando. \nMITCH Of course not. Fernando is like The Highlander. There can be only one. \nDAVE (toasting his beer) \nTO FERNANDO! \nMITCH \nFER--FUCKING--NANDO! They sloppily drink -- when Dave suddenly remembers: \nDAVE OH! So finish your story! The girl calls you up...? \nMITCH Right! So she calls me up, it's like 3 in the morning-- \nDAVE What's her name? \nMITCH Tatiana. \nDAVE Incredible. What's her last name? Mitch just looks at him. \nMITCH Tatiana Calls-Me-At-3-In-The- Morning-And-Wants-To-Fuck-stein, what the fuck, who cares? \nDAVE Is she hot? She is, right? Oh my God I already have a boner! \nMITCH \n(DISTURBED) Maybe we should do this later... \nDAVE NO! Keep going! I need these stories, man! They're all I have. Mitch registers the desperation in his married friend's eyes. \nMITCH Okay, well, you're in luck, because Tatiana is stupid fucking hot. Beautiful face, legs a mile long, perfect ass, blonde hair, and huuuge boobs. \nDAVE Oh my God how big? \nMITCH Double E. \nDAVE Oh my God she sounds like Sabrina. \nMITCH Who's Sabrina? \nDAVE This hot paralegal in my office. \nMITCH Is she on your Cancer List? \nDAVE What's a Cancer List? \nMITCH Don't all married dudes have a Cancer List? No? Like the first three chicks you would bang if your wife suddenly died of cancer? \nDAVE That's sick, man. Jamie is the mother of my children... \n(DISGUSTED) But yes, if I had a Cancer List, Sabrina would be the first on it. \n", "test1_id": 192, "test2_input": "CEO TED NORTON Spare me, Ken, you were just trying to inflate your share price! \nCEO KEN KINKABE This merger is over! I will see you in court! \nCEO TED NORTON Not if we see you first, you prick! The execs furiously race out of the conference room, all of them reaching for their cell phones. War has been declared. The lawyers hurry after the clients, fruitlessly trying to coax them back to the table. Mitch frowns, oo, and tiptoes for the exit.. .until Flemming Steel III grabs his arm, furious. \nFLEMMING STEEL III Right now you need to give me one reason not to fire you. Mitch stammers, oh shit. \nMITCH Relax, dude ... this-this is all part of my master plan. \nFLEMMING STEEL III It is. \nMITCH Yes! Check it out: if we drag this out...we make more money, right? Don't we? Of course we do! And then we can bill the fuck out of them! Some of them don't even speak-ah the engrish so goo, you know what I'm saying? \nFLEMMING STEEL III That's your plan. \nMITCH Yes...? Is it...? It's not a very good plan, is it. \nFLEMMING STEEL III Son, what you've just said to me is highly illegal. You could go to jail for a very long time just for suggesting it... \nMITCH \n(SWEATING) We're lawyers! We're above the law! \nFLEMMING STEEL III I must say, I've never seen this side of you before, Lockwood. I always thought you were on the straight and narrow... \nMITCH Fuck that, ese. I'm straight up gangster all the way through. Flemming eyes him, determining his fate. Mitch can't breathe. \nFLEMMING STEEL III Fine, I'll roll the dice with you But if word of this gets out, I will throw you under the bus so darn fast you won't know what hit you. Now go put on some proper clothes. You look like Joe Pesci. Flemming Steel III hurries off. Mitch exhales, holy shit... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. VAN NUYS -- RANCH HOUSE -- DAY \nDave nervously pulls up to a RANCH HOUSE in the Fiero, reading the address off his iPhone. Several crew trucks are parked out front, and PA's with headsets loiter about. Dave gets out wearing an ironed buttondown shirt tucked into khakis. He self-consciously untucks half his shirt, trying to look \"cooler,\" as he approaches a nearby P.A. \nDAVE Yo, Mitch Planko is here. Where the fuck is Hair & Makeup? \nP.A. \n(POINTING) Um, trailer 3.. ? \nDAVE That's so real. Dave stiffly walks off as the P.A. eyes him, weirded out. \nINT. HAIR & MAKEUP TRAILER -- DAY \nDave, now in leather pants, the top four buttons of his shirt undone, sits in the makeup chair, getting his hair styled. He studies the script, confused. Then a P.A. hurries in. \nP.A. I'm here to take you to set. Is there anything I can get you? Vitamin water, Pelegrino? \nDAVE No thanks. Hey, what does it mean when it says T.S., or B.T.S.? \nP.A. Titty Shot and Bouncing Titty Shot. \n(TO HEADSET) Steve Action is coming to set. Dave, alarmed, follows the P.A. out and \nTHROUGH THE LOW BUDGET SET They've taken over this valley ranch house; cables, lights and sound equipment run everywhere. \nDAVE Wait! W-what kind of movie is this?! \nP.A. It's a lorno. \nDAVE I-I'm not familiar with that genre. \nP.A. Lorno? Light porno? Tits & shadows? You ever hear of Skinemax? \nDAVE Oh no. They arrive in \nAN ORNATE BEDROOM bedecked with cameras, grip equipment -- and thousands of lit candles. The P.A. unbuttons Dave's shirt even further and starts smearing his chest and face with Crisco oil. Just then, the fat balding director, VALTAN -- just Valtan -- from some ethnically cleansed Balkan state, 50's, blows in. \nVALTAN More oil! Make him shiny like fish! \nDAVE Excuse me, are you in charge here? I think there's been some sort of \n", "test2_true": "VALTAN Mona! Where Mona?! And then MONA -- aging actress with fake boobs -- teeters in wearing a flimsy nightgown and six inch heels. \nMONA I'm here! \nVALTAN Okay guys, here scene: Mitch, you enter with gun -- where gun?! A P.A. runs in with a huge MACHINE GUN WITH ROCKET LAUNCHER ATTACHMENT and gives it to Dave, who takes it limply... \nVALTAN (CONT'D) Guard try to stop you, line-line- line, knock him the fuck out, you see Mona asleep in bed, you wake her up and start fuck time, okay? Dave stammers, his head spinning. \nMONA What's my motivation? \nVALTAN Your motivation? Your motivation is show big tit to business traveler in hotel room too scared to order real porno, okay? (blocking the scene) Okay, here shot list: start makeout here, nightgown fall, close-up of titty, candles burning, bouncing titty close-up, moaning, fake sex- in-mouth obscured by hair, more candle, fake backdoor sex obscured by blowing curtain, more candle, her buttock, his buttock, wind blow out candle and finito, okay? \nMONA It's like a poem. \nVALTAN I know, baby, I crush this shit big time. Let's lock it up! \nP. A. Locking it up! As the crew bustle about, Mona turns to a shell-shocked Dave. \nMONA You wanna bump? Mona snorts a fingernail of coke into her nose. \nDAVE A bump--? Of drugs? \nMONA You're cute. But if you try to actually fuck me I'll set your dick on fire with one of these fucking candles, y'understand me? \nDAVE Is this actually happening? \nMONA Pound away on my upper thigh all you want, that's what it's there for, okay? And no, you can't pay me to give you a real BJ, I don't do that shit anymore. Dave's mouth opens, but nothing comes out. A P.A. guides him out of the room. He's still in a trance... \nVALTAN \nANNNND ACTION: Dave stands there, frozen. Behind the camera, Valtan gestures, go! Dave stumbles into the bedroom, holding the huge machine gun like, well, like a corporate lawyer. A BLOW-DRIED GOON appears with a gun. \nBLOW-DRIED GOON No entry! Dave looks around at the bright lights, the camera, the crew watching him -- and he freezes up. The goon tries again: \nBLOWDRIED GOON I said: No entry! \nThen Dave sees a P.A. waving at him, holding up a huge board with his lines written on them. Shielding his eyes from the lights, Dave reads his lines, monotone: \nDAVE If you let me don't in...don't let me in...If you don't let me in, Paco, I will fuck you dead. That doesn't sound right. If you don't let me Taco-- is his name Paco or Taco? Your penmanship is illegible-- \nVALTAN Fuck it, we fix in post! Just knock out guard, wake up girl, and make fuck time! Keep rolling! \nP.A. Still rolling! Dave very effeminately \"karate chops\" the goon in the neck once, and the guy dramatically throws himself against the wall and drops, unconscious. Then Dave crosses and pretends to suddenly see Mona in the bed. His acting is atrocious. \nDAVE Oh my goodness it is Lola my long lost lover Lola who...I love. Her. \nVALTAN More sexy! Too stiff! Annnd Mona wake up, surprised! Mona, not much of a better actor than Dave, wakes up -- and SCREAMS deafeningly, like some 1950's horror queen. \nDAVE \n(COVERING EARS) \nHOLY SHIT-- \nMONA Steve Action?! You perfect bastard! \nVALTAN And now kiss her like savage! Dave, totally grossed out by her, very reluctantly leans in for the kiss. Just before their lips meet, he pulls away. \nDAVE I'm sorry! I can't! \nVALTAN \nCUT! CUT. \n(BEYOND PISSED) What the fuck, man?! She ready for first class trip to fuck town! \nDAVE Look, I can't, I'm married. \nVALTAN No no no, Steve Action throw wife off cliff in last scene. \nDAVE No, I mean, me, in real life. I'm married. \nVALTAN So am I! Mona my wife! Yeah, how stupid is that shit, man?! Now go fake-fuck my wife before owners of house come back from ski vacation to find film crew in master bedroom! Dave just stands there, hopelessly out of place... \n", "test2_id": 193, "test3_input": "CARA Always solve my problems with violence. \nMITCH That's right, baby. Bones. They bump fists. Jamie is stunned. \nJAMIE What?! No, angel, that's exactly the wrong lesson. You should never use violence, except to defend yourself, okay? Mitch subtly shakes his head at Cara, don't listen to her. \nMITCH Violence is cool. \nJAMIE Dave! \nMITCH I'm kidding! \n(TO CARA) I'm not kidding. Cara GIGGLES in the backseat. Jamie can't help but laugh too. Soon they're all LAUGHING. It's a nice moment. \nCARA I love you, Daddy... \nMITCH \n(SURPRISED) Oh. I-I love you too, angel. \nJamie smiles over at Mitch... TIGHT ON MITCH as he feels the family love for the first time. He looks touched... even a little proud... Then his cell phone rings. He answers it: \nMITCH (CONT'D) Lockwood. \nDAVE (ON PHONE) I haven't been on a first date in over a decade and I'm drowning in my own fear--! \nMITCH Don't move. I'll be right over. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nMITCH KICKING OPEN THE DOOR of his old apartment to find Dave, in khaki's and a pressed buttondown, freaking out in the mirror-- \nDAVE How do I look?! \nMITCH Like a fucking tool. Step aside-- Mitch throws open the closet and yanks out a pair of jeans. \nMITCH (CONT'D) These are called jeans. They've been very popular with our nation's young people for over 60 years. Put them on immediately. \nDAVE Jeans? To a restaurant? Mitch punches Dave in the nuts; he doubles over. \nMITCH Shut up and do what I say. We only have 3 hours to make you cool... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MITCH'S BATHROOM \nMitch shows Dave how to put gel into his hair. \nMITCH This is called gel, or product. Use too little and you look like a pedophile Cub Scout leader, use too much and you look Persian. Neither is a winning hand. Dave very nervously applies gel to his hair... \nINT. MITCH'S SHOWER STALL \nDave stands with his pants around his ankles as Mitch very delicately shaves his balls with a Bic razor. \nMITCH Okay, normally I would never do this for another man, but since we're in a rush, and technically this is my testicle bag, I'm making a rare exception. Always man-scape before a first date. It shows a lady that you're clean, considerate, and American. \nDAVE \nIT TICKLES-- \nMITCH Don't speak, it jiggles your sack. \nEXT. EXOTIC MOTORCARS -- EVENING \nExotic sells the most pimped-out used cars in LA. Mitch SQUEALS off the lot in a RED FERRARI and cruises down the Sunset Strip, music BLASTING. Dave sits shotgun, stunned. \nDAVE I can't believe you just charged a Ferrari to my Discover Card. \nMITCH You need to learn to be spontaneous, Dave. Chicks like spontaneous. (to WOMEN walking by) Hey ladies! Show us your tits! They flip him off. Mitch laughs. Dave is still floored: \nDAVE What are we gonna tell Jamie...? \nMITCH Do me a favor, Dave. Relax your butt hole. \n", "test3_true": "MITCH Your sphincter. Just... release it. Dave's entire body visibly relaxes a bit. \nMITCH (CONT'D) You didn't even know it was puckered, right? Now recline your seat a bit... \n(DAVE RECLINES) Good. Now take some deep breaths. (Dave does, calming) Now give me your sunglasses. Dave gives him his sunglasses; Mitch chucks them out the window and hands him his cool Ray Ban's. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Now, just for like three minutes, don't be a dad, don't be a husband, don't be a lawyer, just be a dude rolling down Sunset strip in a fucking Ferrari with his best friend listening to Seal, okay? Dave looks out the window, getting into it... \nMITCH (CONT'D) Feels good, right? After a moment, a TEAR escapes from under Dave's shades. \nMITCH (CONT'D) It's okay, just let it out. \nDAVE It's been so long since I felt cool... \nMITCH I know, baby. I know. They cruise for a bit longer, then Mitch pulls into a CAR WASH. Dave looks confused. \nDAVE Why are we washing the car? It's brand new. \nMITCH We're not washing the car, David. We're getting you mentally, physically, and spiritually ready for your date. Come on. \nINT. CAR WASH -- LOBBY -- MOMENTS LATER \nMitch and a very confused Dave enter the car wash lobby. \nMITCH Now. I don't have time to cover all the ways in which women have changed since you last dated... Mitch stops at the register to pay. Various CAR WASH EMPLOYEES keep saying hi to Dave, weirding him out. \nCAR WASH EMPLOYEES Hola, Mitch! / Como esta, Mitch?! \nMITCH The bottom line is: the internet has revolutionized everything. \nDAVE You mean like J-date? \nMITCH Fuck J-date. No. The internet has changed chicks in three major ways: first, access and acceptance of pornography has commoditized women and pressured them into becoming sluttier at far younger ages, which is awesome. Mitch finishes paying and continues through the car wash. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Second: text messaging has de- stigmatized the booty call. Call a girl at 3 in the morning for sex and it's creepy. Text her \"SUCK WANG MIDNIGHT??\" and it's classy. I have no idea why, but again, an awesome development. \n(MORE) \nMITCH (CONT'D) Third: Facebook and other social networking sites have falsely convinced people -- women included -- that they are funny, interesting, and unique. Get used to listening waaay more than you used to. Chicks are the new dudes, they talk about themselves all the fucking time now. Practice saying things like \"you are so different\" and \"no, really, what Golden Girl would you be?\" and \"I love Lady Gaga too.\" \nDAVE What's a Lady Gaga? \nMITCH I don't know, it's either a pop singer or an energy drink. They arrive at the CAR WASH WAITING AREA. People sit around, waiting for their cars, many of them young, female, and cute. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Okay, let's talk to some honeys, get your flow going again. \nDAVE So wait, why are we at a car wash? \nMITCH The girls are alone, bored, and old enough to drive -- it's a goldmine. I run game here four to seven times a week. Now go on, bust a move. \nDAVE Come on, I talk to women all the time, I don't need to practice. \nMITCH Really. \nDAVE Yes. And no offense, as a married man, I probably know how to talk to women better than you do. \nMITCH Reall v! \nDAVE Yes! It's not that hard. They just want to be respected and listened to like everybody else. \nMITCH Okay Daddy Day Care show me how it's done then! Shit! Dave sighs and crosses to a CUTE BLONDE texting nearby. As he draws closer, however, he starts to tense up...soon he's sweating... it's been a long time ...by the time he finally reaches the blonde, his voice is ridiculously shrill: \nDAVE Hello there what's your name?! She doesn't even look up from her BlackBerry. Dave's confidence instantly crumbles... \nDAVE (CONT'D) I-I'm sorry, I'm not trying to hit on you. I'm just...I mean, I'm married, so that's not even a thing. W-W-Where are you from--? Mitch appears and yanks him away. Dave looks traumatized: \nDAVE (CONT'D) Was she reaching for her rape whistle? \nMITCH Shake it off. Being single is like the Tour De France: it's all about quick recovery time. Now go on, get your groove back, you're meeting Sabrina in a half hour. \nQUICK CUTS: Of Dave trying to chat up various YOUNG WOMEN at the carwash. \nDAVE Your name is Dora? Like the Explorah?! No...? You aren't familiar with that show...? \n", "test3_id": 194}

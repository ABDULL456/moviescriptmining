{"test1_input": "THE CHANGE-UP \nWritten by \nJon Lucas & Scott Moore \nJuly 31, 2009 \nOPEN ON: PEACEFUL BLACK STILLNESS Then we hear a baby SCREAM BLOODY MURDER. Then a second baby joins in, even more shrill than the first. Finally, we hear the worst two words a parent can ever hear: \nGROGGY WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Your turn. \nGROGGY MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Fuck. \nINT. SUBURBAN HOUSE -- NIGHT \nDAVE LOCKWOOD, 30, bleary-eyed father of three, shuffles through his well-appointed suburban home, passing a grandfather clock reading 3:45. He stumbles over a TOY GIRAFFE -- it SQUEAKS, and Dave sleepily mumbles: \nDAVE Sorry Hank. \nINT. NURSERY-- NIGHT \nHis eyes half-open, Dave changes the diaper of his very cute, very insane nine month old daughter, SARAH, who screams and pitches about her changing table. \nDAVE \nPLEASE DON'T-- Honey, that's not-- Maybe if you-- She snatches a tin of baby powder and swings it about like a mace, knocking over the diaper caddy, the wipes, the lotion -- and dispersing a cloud of white powder all over the nursery. Blinded and SNEEZING, Dave manages to stay on point and change the diaper like Van Damme at the end of Bloodsport. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Can't-see ...must...persevere... He finishes changing Sarah, places her back in her crib, then picks up Sarah's twin brother, PETER, from his crib -- which is good because he's been SLAMMING his head against the wall. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Come on, buddy, we've talked about the head thing-- Dave places Peter on the changing table and opens his diaper. It's only wet, and Dave, pleasantly relieved, reaches for a fresh diaper... \nOnly Sarah has knocked the caddy all the way down the changing table... Holding down Peter with his left hand, Dave fully extends, leaning waaay over, reaching for the diaper caddy... It's just out of reach.. .he somehow stretches further... It's only when Dave glances back that he realizes that his head is now perfectly lined up with his son's QUIVERING ANUS. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Oh no. \nTHE BABY'S BUTT-HOLE ERUPTS with mustardy projectile stool, blasting Dave in the eyes, nose and open mouth. Dave remains frozen, excrement dripping down his face -- but, like a true dad, he does not let go of his squirming child... \nINT. HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nDave staggers down the hall, his hair white with baby powder, his face covered in poo, and a twin in each arm SCREAMING into each of his ears. He soldiers on, stoic, an unsung hero in his time... \nINT. KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nJuggling the twins in his arms, Dave wipes his face off with paper towels and prepares two baby bottles -- nipples, filters, defrosted breastmilk -- while the babies take turns kicking him in the balls and SCREAMING. \nDAVE Please, sweetheart, not my-- Honey, Daddy needs those-- \nINT. DEN -- NIGHT \nDave sits on his couch and positions the screaming, squirming twins across his lap in an X pattern, plunks the bottles into their mouths -- and instantly the twins settle down and slurp away like perfect little angels. Dave exhales. Whew. Then he reaches for the remote control and turns on the TV. An old rerun of Magnum, P.I. is playing. Dave watches, exhausted and expressionless. \nON SCREEN, Tom Selleck, resplendent in mustache, corduroy short shorts, and Hawaiian shirt, teaches a nubile CO-ED in a scandalous bikini how to snorkel in beautiful sun-drenched Waikiki. They're laughing and having a blast... Dave watches, detached... Then his face starts to change... \nMAGNUM, P.I. Is this the life you always dreamed of? Dave shakes his head, no, despair in his eyes... ON TV, the co-ed nods, yes, and hungrily kisses Magnum... Dave watches on with genuine existential longing... and soon a tear falls from his eye. And then another. \nDAVE Take me with you Magnum P. I... Before long Dave is CRYING like a schoolgirl. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Please take me with you... \nCUT TO: \nMAN'S VOICE (V.0.) How are the kids? \nDAVE (V.0.) Terrific! Just terrific. We are now \nINT. STEEL, KUHBACH, MCCLOUD -- LAW FIRM -- MORNING \nDave, in a conservative suit and clutching a massive coffee, hurries down the hall with FLEMMING STEEL III, 50's, stiff, humorless WASPY partner of this white shoe law firm. \nFLEMMING STEEL III Children are such a joy. \nDAVE Aren't they? Yes. Always. (to passing SECRETARY) Good morning, Rebecca. \n", "test1_true": "DAVE All but signed. \nFLEMMING STEEL III And just in time for your partner review no less. \nDAVE \n(SMILING) Really? I hadn't noticed. \nFLEMMING STEEL III I look forward to having your antic sense of humor in the partners' suite, Lockwood. It can get a touch dry up there. \nDAVE Thank you, sir. \nFLEMMING STEEL III (re: Dave's necktie knot) But a double windsor? Come on, son, this isn't the dog track. \nDAVE No sir, absolutely not. So sorry. Dave quickly undoes his tie as Flemming turns down a hallway. SABRINA McARDLE, cute young paralegal, falls into step with Dave, stymieing laughter. \nSABRINA MCARDLE Really? The dog track? \nDAVE Last week he told me my shoes were \"dangerously Italian.\" \nSABRINA MCARDLE (laughing, handing him docs) Amalgamated signing statements. \nDAVE Thanks, Sabrina. \nSABRINA MCARDLE Have a good one... She smiles and breezes back down the hallway. Dave stops and watches her go, lust in his eyes. \nThen he hears TSK-TSK-TSK. He looks over at his mean old secretary, GLADYS, 71, sitting at her desk. \nGLADYS For shame, Mr. Lockwood! For shame! You are a married man! \nDAVE I have no idea what you're talking about, Gladys... Reddening, he snatches a huge pile of pink message slips and hurries towards his office. She follows him, scolding: \nGLADYS With children. \nDAVE Yes, thank you, I almost forgot about them for like two seconds... \nINT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS \nDave enters his modest office; his phone is RINGING. \nGLADYS The only thing that harlot needs to put in her mouth is a sandwich. \nDAVE Gladys, I'm a grown man, okay? He angrily punches \"SPEAKER\" on his RINGING phone as he reties his tie with a more traditional knot. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Lockwood. A shrill, horribly impersonated British accent fills Dave's office -- as well as all of the surrounding offices. \nVOICE ON PHONE \nYES, MY DOUCHEBAG EXPLODED THIS \nMORNING AND I'D LIKE TO SUE--! As Gladys and various CO-WORKERS turn, shocked, Dave quickly fumbles for the receiver and takes the call off speaker. \nDAVE Jesus, Mitch, I'm at work-- \nVOICE ON PHONE \nWHO'S MITCH?! THIS IS MISS ELIZA \nHAVERSHAM AND I AM THE VICTIM OF A \nFAULTY BAG OF DOUCHE! \nDAVE Dude, how stoned are you? \nINTERCUT WITH: MITCH PLANKO, 30, shirtless, Dodgers hat backwards, sitting on a futon in his sparse white apartment, smoking a bong shaped like a shotgun. Beat. He drops the horrible accent: \nMITCH I'm pretty stoned. \nDAVE Come on, it's 10 in the morning. \nMITCH Dude, guess what? Great news. \nDAVE What? \n", "test1_id": 192, "test2_input": "MITCH I found a futon on the street. \nDAVE That is great news. \nMITCH I sort of had to fight a bum for it -- is that bad? \nDAVE Kind of. Is there a reason you're calling or--? \nMITCH Are you gonna bitch out on tonight? You are, aren't you. Dave, half-listening, sits at his desk and answers emails. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Dodgers-Giants, dude! We haven't missed one of these in like 20 years! Don't be a vajeen! \nDAVE Dude, I'm coming-- \nMITCH You always do this! You never make time for your friends anymore and I'm sorry to be the one to tell you this, but people are starting to talk. Feelings are getting hurt. \nDAVE Really? Whose feelings? \nMITCH Not mine, because, like a samurai, I have trained myself to feel nothing except revenge and honor, but other people -- nameless, other, more sensitive people -- are hurt, and they think you need to treasure your friendships a little bit more. (exhaling massive bong rip) How concerned should I be that my new futon smells like death? \nDAVE (distracted, typing) Look, just, what time are you picking me up tonight? \nMITCH If you bail I will rape you. \nDAVE Dude, I get it, I'm coming-- \nMITCH In your eye. I will eye-rape you. \nREPEATEDLY-- Just then there's a knock on Mitch's apartment door. \nVOICE AT HIS DOOR (V.0.) Mitch? \nMITCH Shit. Mitch starts waving away the pot smoke. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Gotta go, pick you up at six--! \nSTAY WITH MITCH as he quickly clicks off his iPhone, jams his bong under the futon, opens the window, and tries to blow the pot smoke out of his apartment with quick little PUFFS. \nMITCH (CONT'D) One sec, Dad! The smoke clears and Mitch jogs to the door and opens it to reveal his father, MITCH, SR., 60's, friendly, in a suit, holding a pile of mail. \nMITCH, SR. Hey, buddy! Your mailbox was spilling over. \nMITCH Oh thanks, I always forget. They hug, and Mitch takes the mail and, without looking at it, chucks it onto a HUGE PILE OF OLD MAIL in the corner. \nMITCH, SR. Were you smoking marijuana in here? \nMITCH No! Honestly, it's my new futon, it smells like illegal drugs. \nMITCH, SR. We've talked about this, Mitch. Smoke your grass on the balcony, okay? It's just hard for me to tell the other tenants they can't smoke in their units when my own son is blazing away in his, you know? \nMITCH You got it, Dad. \nMITCH, SR. Oh hey, I saw your commercial on channel 9 again last night... \nMITCH Which one? \"Give Gonorrhea The Boot\" or \"Samir's Pet Shack Our Low Low Prices Are Snake-sational?\" \nMITCH, SR. Samir's Pet Shack. It's just a shame you can't see your face in that giant ape costume. \nMITCH Actually, the real shame is that Samir paid me in fucking organic bird seed, but whatever... He glares at several crates of BIRD SEED by the door. \nMITCH, SR. Well, your mother would've liked it. She always loved animals... \n(AWKWARD MOMENT) Anyway. I was just in the neighborhood, wanted to check in. How you doing, cash-wise? \nMITCH I'm a little tight, actually, Pops. Especially vis a vis, you know, the whole bird seed situation. \nMITCH, SR. Five hundred? \nMITCH Can you make it a grand? Mitch's dad smiles to hide his disappointment and hands his 30-year-old son a roll of hundred dollar bills. \nMITCH, SR. You thought any more about coming to work for me? \nMITCH Yeeeah...I'm not really sure I'm a \"work\" guy, you know what I mean? Plus, I've been getting a ton of auditions recently, so... \n", "test2_true": "MITCH Thanks, pop. Bones. Mitch, Sr. smiles and awkwardly bumps his son's fist. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Batting cages next weekend? \nMITCH, SR. Great! See you then. \nMitch, Sr. smiles sadly and exits. Mitch BURPS and reaches for his bong, having noticed none of his father's distress... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BRENTWOOD -- EVENING \nESTABLISHING SHOTS of Dave's beautiful colonial home. Huge oak trees shade the lush front lawn. New Audi and BMW station wagons sit in the driveway. We hear WATER SPLASHING... \nINT. DAVE'S HOUSE -- BATHROOM -- EVENING \nThe twins sit in the bath, motionless, anticipatory... \nDAVE (V.0.) \n.AND THEN THE BABY-EATING MONSTER \nEMERGES FROM THE DEEP RAAWWWWR. Dave rises up from beside the tub, arms upraised, soap suds covering his face! The twins SCREAM and SPLASH, ecstatic! Dave tries not to laugh, but he's having too much fun... Behind Dave, his sweet daughter CARA, 5, sits on the closed toilet lid in a ballet tutu, reading her BUTTERFLY BOOK. \nCARA Daddy daddy, which is your favorite butterfly, the Southern Monarch or the Many-Spotted Skipperling? Dave glances at the book as he washes the twins. \nDAVE Oh, I'm a Many-Spotted Skipperling man all the way. The Southern Monarch is just a glorified moth. \nCARA \n(VERY SERIOUS) Yes. I tend to agree... Dave smiles. Then his handsome wife JAMIE, 30's, blows into the bathroom in a suit and starts removing her makeup. \nJAMIE What a day. Dr. Klein lost the twins immunization record, the wireless went down, and Cara got bullied in ballet class again. \nCARA Nicolette Peters keeps knocking me over during the battement glisse. \nDAVE Oh, I'm sorry, sugar-bug... Dave looks genuinely concerned. Cara just shrugs and keeps reading her butterfly book. Jamie whispers to him: \nJAMIE We need to remind her to keep striving for verbal resolution. \nDAVE Right, of course. Jamie finally notices Dave's foam-covered face, and softens. \nJAMIE And how was your day, monster man? Before Dave can answer, the doorbell rings, DING-DONG! They exchange the weary smile of parents who never see each other. \nJAMIE (CONT'D) He's early. \nDAVE Of course he's early. All he does all day is eat hummus and masturbate. \nCUT TO: \nTHE FRONT DOOR OPENING to reveal MITCH in shades, fedora, and a Dodgers jersey. Jamie, holding Cara, lets him in. \nMITCH Whatup bitches! \nJAMIE \n(LAUGHING) Really? He takes Cara and playfully -- and incredibly recklessly -- flips her in the air. \nMITCH How's my favorite ballerina?! \nCARA I'm good! Are you coming to my recital on Thursday?! \nMITCH Oh no, honey, the only style of dancing I support is exotic... He plunks her on the floor and blows into \nDAVE'S AMAZING KITCHEN replete with granite counter tops, built-in appliances, fresh flowers, and bowls teeming with fruit. Mitch beelines for the Subzero fridge and opens it: it's stocked. His eyes alight. \nMITCH Jesus Christ you could feed Africa with this fridge... As Jamie starts prepping a salad across the kitchen, Mitch raids the fridge, packing his cargo pants with kid's snacks, bagels, yogurts, juice boxes, everything. \nMITCH (CONT'D) These leftovers from Morton's? \nJAMIE Oh no, hon, those are super old-- Too late -- Mitch is already eating the very old steak. \nMITCH Chimichurri. score. As Mitch chews, he eyes Jamie chopping vegetables. \n", "test2_id": 193, "test3_input": "MITCH Fuck it. Helping ridiculously rich people become even more ridiculously rich is why I go to work every day. \nCEO TED NORTON Well, you are bar none the best attorney I've ever worked with! \nMITCH I am?! Fuck, I've never really been good at anything before... Mitch considers this a second, then laughs, proud. \nMITCH (CONT'D) Gimme me a hug you tiny capitalist! Mitch hugs Ted and lifts him off the ground, spinning him. \nMITCH (CONT'D) I love you so much... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DODGERS STADIUM -- DAY \nA perfect, sunny day game at Dodgers stadium. Dave and Sabrina take their seats behind home plate. \nDAVE \n(AMAZED) These are your grandfather's seats? \nSABRINA Yeah, my family's been coming to Dodger games since they moved here from Brooklyn in '58. Dave looks at her, his amazement only growing... \nDAVE Really? Who's your favorite Dodger? \nSABRINA Fernando, obviously. \nBlown away, Dave unzips his jacket to reveal a throwback number 34 Fernando Valenzuela jersey. She laughs. \nSABRINA (CONT'D) No way! \nDAVE It's too soon to say I love you, right? That's against the rules? she laughs and kisses him. \nSABRINA You're cute. Smiling, Dave looks out at the perfect ball field, his arm around Sabrina-he looks profoundly... existentially.. .happy. And then his iPhone RINGS. He answers it: \nDAVE Mitch Planko who the fuck is this. \nINTERCUT WITH: DISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON sitting at her desk, talking on the phone and doing WHIPPETS off a can of Reddi-Wip; twenty empty cans litter her desk. \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON This is Carla Nelson from the Los Angeles Department of Parks. \nDAVE Oh my God, hi! Dave steps away to take the call. Carla does another whippet. \nDAVE (CONT'D) What's.. .going on? \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON We found that fountain. It's in our San Pedro warehouse. Dave glances back at Sabrina... and winces, conflicted: \nDAVE And... and how long is it going to be there? \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON It ships out tonight for repairs. \nDAVE And after that? \nDISTRICT MANAGER CARLA NELSON (doing another whippet) No fucking clue, dude. Dave gets a CALL WAITING BEEP. \nDAVE Right. Okay, well thanks, Carla. (clicking over to other line) Hello? \nINTERCUT WITH: MITCH He's walking down the hall of his law firm, on the phone, as all of his peers step from their offices, APPLAUDING his victory, slapping him on the back, shaking his hand. \nMITCH You hear about the fountain? \nDAVE Yeah... We should probably switch back, huh? Mitch high-fives a co-worker. \nMITCH Sure. Right. I mean... the funny thing is...I was just starting to enjoy your life a little bit... \nDAVE Yeah, and I was just starting to enjoy yours, too... \nMITCH Really? \nDAVE Really. \nMITCH So.. .maybe we should keep going--? \nDAVE I'm so glad you said that. \n", "test3_true": "(MORE) \nMITCH (CONT'D) I just closed the Amalgamated deal for 825 million dollars and for the first time ever, people actually respect me! It's so weird! Word is they're going to make me partner tonight! I love your life, dude! \nDAVE And I love yours! All the free time and the fun activities and I'm really growing as an actor and I think Sabrina might actually have intercourse with me tonight! \nMITCH Dude, you sent her flowers -- she's gonna fuck you like a crack whore on rent day. \nDAVE So, wait, what are we talking about here? Staying like this... forever: \nMITCH No! Course not. \nDAVE Right! That's crazy... Beat. \nMITCH Is it though...? Mitch bumps fists with smiling co-workers... Dave watches Sabrina CHEER after a base hit... \nDAVE It's so strange, when the change-up happened, we were so focussed on switching back into our bodies that we didn't even consider that this might be exactly what we both needed... \nMITCH Yeah, we're fucking morons. \nDAVE All right, well, see ya, Dave... \nMITCH Take it easy, Mitch... \nThey both hang up, surprised smiles on their faces... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nA DEAFENING THUNDER-CLAP RAIN blankets Los Angeles that night. It's an epic storm... \nINT. CUT RESTAURANT -- NIGHT \nThe private back room of this upscale Beverly Hills eatery is filled with the esteemed PARTNERS of Steel, Kuhbach, McCloud, as well as Mitch, Jamie, and little Cara. Everyone's dressed to the nines and enjoying fabulously overpriced food and drink. Then Flemming stands and DINGS his wine glass. \nFLEMMING STEEL III Good evening, one and all! The room quiets as a PROJECTION SCREEN lowers behind him. \nFLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D) We are gathered here tonight to celebrate the newest partner in our esteemed firm. For those of you who haven't had the pleasure of working with this brilliant young man, we've prepared this short, mildly embarrassing presentation to introduce him. Please, enjoy... Mitch looks at Jamie, who smiles conspiratorially. Behind the table, Gladys turns on a projector. Some Dido song plays as, on the SCREEN, we start to see PHOTOS from Dave's life... \nFLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D) David Andrew Lockwood was born on February 1st, 1974, in Palmdale... SHOTS of Dave as a baby appear. Everyone AWWW's. Jamie takes Mitch's hand... \nFLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D) Dave was a sweet, diligent, hard- working little boy... A SHOT of boyhood Dave in a very dorky 70's Little League outfit flashes onto the screen... \nFLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D) In high school, Dave belonged to over 17 clubs and teams, and graduated first in his class... \nSHOTS play of Dave in 80's high school apparel, arguing for the debate team, wearing a goofy beret at French Club, etc... Everyone LAUGHS. Jamie smiles at Mitch, only he looks a little troubled: this is not my life... \nFLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D) After winning a full scholarship to Princeton, Dave amazingly graduated in just three years... A SHOT of college-age Dave getting his diploma appears... \nFLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D) And, after graduating from Yale Law School with high honors, Dave clerked for Justice Souter on the United States Supreme Court... A SHOT of young Dave talking with Justice Souter plays... Around the table, the partners MURMUR, impressed. Mitch grows increasingly uncomfortable, shifting in his seat... \nFLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D) Shortly after, Dave returned west to marry his lifelong best friend, Jamie Anne Johnson... SHOTS roll of Dave and Jamie on their wedding day, laughing. Jamie squeezes Mitch's hand, a happy mist in her eyes. Mitch frowns: this is not my wife... \nFLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D) Cara came along first, followed by the twins, Peter and Sarah... SHOTS of Dave, wearing scrubs, happily holding his various newborn babies in the hospital flash onto the screen... Cara leans over to Mitch and whispers: \nCARA Look, Daddy, it's you and me! Mitch forces a tight smile, right... \nFLEMMING STEEL III And somewhere along the way, we were lucky enough to find him... \nSHOTS roll of Dave as a lawyer, swearing in at the Bar, arguing in court, and, finally, celebrating today's victory. The image fades as the lights in the room slowly rise... \nFLEMMING STEEL III (CONT'D) Industrious. Ambitious. Honorable. They were true of him then, they are even more true of him now. It is my distinct honor to introduce our newest partner, David Lockwood. The room breaks into heartfelt APPLAUSE. \nPARTNERS \nHUZZAH! HUZZAH: Mitch squirms, hating this... Jamie leans over to him: \nJAMIE I'm so proud of you, baby. You worked so hard for this... Mitch winces, knowing just how wrong she is. All around him, the partners stand, APPLAUDING. Mitch stands, a bit dizzy. \nMITCH I-I'm sorry...I just... He hurries off towards the bathroom. Everyone looks confused. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \n", "test3_id": 194}

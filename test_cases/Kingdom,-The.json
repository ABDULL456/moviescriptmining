WASHINGTON, DC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY                   2 \nWe're in a kindergarten classroom of 25 SIX YEAR OLDS. All sitting on the floor, legs crossed. Sitting in front of the kids is Little KEVIN FLEURY, flanked by his mom LYLA FLEURY and his dad RONALD FLEURY, in a dark suit. \nLittle Kevin has a large cardboard square with pictures from different stages of his life taped to it. He's telling the class about the photos. \nWe're TIGHT ON the pictures. TIGHT ON the young faces. TIGHT ON Fleury. \nKEVIN FLEURY This is my Fredricksburg house and my grandma Ruth playing with my skateboard ramp. It's a Tony Hawk jump ramp. \nA little girl, MICK raises her hand. \nKEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) Mick? \nSilence from Mick \nMICK I forgot what I was going to say. \nKevin points to another picture. \nKEVIN FLEURY This is me at my second birthday party with my mom and my dad. That's my cake. \nFleury looks down sweet at his son. \nKEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) This is me with my mom at the zoo and this is my dad and me and my grandpa Willie. \nKevin points to another photo. \nKEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) And this is me and my dad and my grandpa Willie at my dad's office. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   2. \nThe kids all lean forward and squirm as they try and get closer to the pictures. MISS ROSS, the pretty twenty five year old teacher watches from the side. \nMICK Where's your gun? \nLITTLE BOY Yeah, where is your gun? \nPretty much all the kids get in on this now. Everyone wants to see Fleury's gun. Fleury makes eyes at Miss Ross. She's giving him a `no fucking way' hard eye. \nFLEURY I'm assuming that there are no bad guys in this room. Isn't that right? I mean, are you guys good guys or bad guys? \nTHE WHOLE CLASS GOOD GUYS! \nFLEURY Right. So why would I have brought my gun to a room full of good guys? \nThis silences the class. Miss Ross keeps things moving, pointing to a photo. \nMISS ROSS What's that picture? \nKEVIN FLEURY This is me and my dad playing Battleship at my dad's apartment. \nMick's hand goes back up. \nKEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) Mick? \nMICK What is a battleship? \nKEVIN FLEURY (abruptly) My parents are divorced. \nA beat. Lyla and Ron look down at Kevin, stalled... \nKINGDOM 8/18/06    3. \nKEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) But that's OK `cause the most important thing is to know that everybody loves each other. \nThis hits a bit hard on Lyla and Ron. Miss Ross jumps in. \nMISS ROSS So, who's that in that picture up on top? \nKEVIN FLEURY That's my fish, his name is Jaws and he's a really mean fish. \nCONTINUED: \n3   OMITTED - SEE 68A                                                3 \n4   INT.

His happiest day! Can you tell us about that day, Mr. Fleury? \nFleury smiles, looks out at the class. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   4. \nRONALD FLEURY I sure can. That was December 4th and that was the day that we spent the whole day in the hospital waiting for this guy right here to come out of Kevin's mom's tummy. And we waited and waited but he wouldn't come and we kept waiting and finally the doctor said `OK...he's not gonna come out on his own so we got to go get him.' And well, \nFleury stops, checks in with Miss Ross. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) Can I tell this story? \nMISS ROSS Go for it. \nRONALD Fleury So they take her and put her on a special bed and they give her some medicine so she doesn't feel any pain then they take out this tiny little knife and make a tiny little cut right here in her tummy. \nThe kids are mesmerized... \nMISS ROSS Then what happened? \nRONALD Fleury Then the doctor put her hands way up into Kevin's mom's tummy. WAY IN! And then you know what they did? \nA little girl, LU LU: WIDE EYED \nLU LU What did they do? \nRONALD FLEURY They started to pull and pull and pull... they had something in there and it started coming and they were pulling and the doctor all of the sudden said \"STOP!\" \nThe class is frozen. Fleury has them. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   5. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) They stopped pulling and the doctor looked up at me and said `Hey, Mr. Fleury - you ready to have your world rocked?' And I just stared at her and she pulled this little head up out of that belly. And it was him. His head. And I looked down at him and screamed \"Kevin!!\" And he looked down at me and screamed \"Daddy!!\" \nThe kids are howling! \nCUT TO: \n7   EXT. AN UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - LATE DAY                             7 \nA Muslim family sits together at a table under a tented- canopy: 32 year-old MAN nervously chewing on a toothpick, and his 8 and 15 year-old SONS. The 8yo leans his weight into an old MAN hunched and obscured by his grandson - this is his Grandfather. He gently rubs the Boy's head with an ancient left hand. The Boy finger-paints in Arabic script, right to left, getting paint on the table. Read the translation: There is no God but Allah. \nThe Grandfather's face is down, obscured by his shumagh: the head-wrap worn by some Muslim men. Never a clear view of his face. His 32 year old Son and eldest Grandson sit next to them, the Son talking quietly on a cell phone, chewing that toothpick, eyes set on something in the distance: A Security Gate three hundred yards away, the entrance to some sort of compound. The Compound looks like a walled-off subdivision, most of which we can see from this high up. \nThe landscape is foreign. Scrub desert. Ten miles beyond, on the horizon: the shimmer of a modern skyline. Surreal monolithic shapes made more so by the heat. \nMuted yells-claps-screams waft in from that Compound now... Catches the youngest Grandson's attention. Eyes lift up from his painting: the yells-claps-screams are coming from a softball game mostly visible behind the Compound's reinforced walls that extend a mile in each direction. Played on the only stretch of green grass visible from this vantage. \n8   OMITTED                                                        8 \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   6. \n9    EXT. COMPOUND MAIN ENTRANCE - LATE DAY                          9 \nSounds from the softball game much louder now, just over the walls. Security perimeters two checkpoints deep before you get to the main gate. A maze of concrete Jersey-barriers to slow all entering vehicles: give machine-gun emplacements flanking the entrance plenty of time to shred those vehicles if need be. Middle-Eastern Police platoons. 500 lbs. lift- gates to dissuade any vehicle that just tries to ram through. \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM: a lean, 27 year-old Middle-Eastern Policeman in-command of the Entrance. Sweats through his uniform. A late-model Range Rover with blacked-out windows queues up. All the windows roll down: just a single, portly White WOMAN behind the wheel, her INFANT CHILD in a car-seat in front. Two other Uniformed Officers mirror-scan the bottom of the Rover. \nA brief exchange, as Haytham checks his ID: \nDRIVER How are you today, Sergeant? \nHAYTHAM Sun is shining. Wind is blowing. How bad can I be doing? \nDRIVER I like that, \"Sun is shining...\" \nA tight smile from Haytham. \nThe other Officers are checking the inside of the Rover now. They nod to Haytham, Haytham hands the ID back to her. Windows rolls up. Lift-gate goes up. Range Rover pulls away, navigating the zig-zag jersey barriers. \n10   INT. COMPOUND - NEXT MOMENT                                 10 \nStay with the Range Rover as it moves deeper into the complex. Think middle-class Phoenix suburb circa 1960: stucco homes sandwiched between dormitory style apartment blocks, concrete and rock where grass should be. \nThe Range Rover passes a tank with a caged SOLDIER on top sitting behind a fifty caliber GUN. A Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle of the road is the last of the security. Official markings, emergency lights in the grill. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   7. \n11   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOFTOP - SAME MOMENT                           11 \nThe Son studies the compound through binoculars, while the youngest Grandson squints to study the softball game: Interest cut with jealousy. More muted cheers float. Behind and above him, his Grandfather's voice, rough as sand, to his 32 year-old Son, in Arabic: \nGRANDFATHER (O.C.) Hang up the phone. If they're not ready now, no words will change it. \n12   EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - NEXT MOMENT                 12 \nAnother Middle-Eastern POLICEMAN takes in the motley competition: half-smiling, half-smirking at a plump-pink White Man cheering on his plump-pink 9 year-old Son sliding into third. \nWHITE MAN GET DIRTY! \nSafe. Clapping and Hoots. The PITCHER: an older White Man in his middle forties visibly frustrated. A 25 year-old African- American Batter steps to the plate now. Pitcher turns to his Fielders: \n", "test1_id": 2547, "test2_input": "KINGDOM 8/18/06   14. \nRONALD FLEURY I'm gonna try... \nLooks at Lyla who's been through this drill too many times, knows this face. Ronald can only give a little shrug, which Lyla gives right back. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) (to Lyla) Can you get a ride? \nShe nods yes. Miss Ross nearby, surprised by this: \nMISS ROSS Where's your husband going? \nLYLA FLEURY Ex-husband, and God knows. \nThen a wave of fear ripples across her face. She hesitates, then calls after him: \nLYLA FLEURY (CONT'D) BE SAFE. \nRonald turns, gives a little Cheshire grin, puts the phone back up to his ear. \n28   EXT. AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPOUND BLAST SITES - EVENING         28 \nThe shattered softball diamond and parking lot. Emergency lights swirl from everywhere. Acrid smoke. \nFRANCIS MANNER (FBI LEGAT, US Embassy) is giant. The kind of American that only grows in tiny southern hamlets. Military whitewalls, short-sleeves, khaki Dockers, a thick Casio G- shock, FBI credentials visible on a chain. \nHangs up his phone. Lifts his eyes: Hell from one side of the frame to the other. Saudi teams setting up portable lights that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent. Columns of black smoke. Fleets of emergency vehicles. 100 uniformed men. Another 200 in bio-suits combing the ball field, the parking lot. Fran has to do something/anything. \nMove through the horror with him now. His hands shake, his face already dirty with soot. Jumps in with a Saudi team pulling a half-burned WOMAN out of a smoldering Range Rover. She fights them, gouging Fran's face, trying to get back in. \nShe is the woman we met at the gate of the compound.    She wants her baby. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   15. \nFran bloodied, just kind of steps away from the woman. Leaves the Saudi emergency team to fight with her. Backs away until he feels grass under his feet. The woman's screams reverberate. Fran just sits in the grass. Staring at the woman, her shattered soul. Forces himself to look away. Eyes come to rest on a child's baseball cap: ragged holes ringed with black stains: where blood dried on the blue felt. \nVOICE (O.C.) (immediately behind) Fran. You gotta stand Big Man... \nFran turns to find REX BURR: 5'7\" fireplug. A long silence. Fran points to the hat: \nFRANCIS MANNER Rex, how old were you when your hat was that small? \nWe watch tears well in Rex's eyes... \nREX BURR You gotta stand, Big Man. \nFran does. Wipes his hands on his pants. Slack-jaw hopeless. The first moments in what will be weeks of reverse- engineering the murders of unknown dozens. He and Rex step to a group of WALKING-WOUNDED. A NEIGHBOR doles out mugs of coffee. Most everyone from the compound is out, pondering the proximity. SAUDI emergency teams sprint past. Fran spits, settles in: \nFRANCIS MANNER We need to get everyone back, then get all their- \nSOMETHING HUGE EXPLODES over their shoulders, 50 yards away. The Attack's coup de grace: wait for people to lift up their heads, hit them again. Five times the size of the suicide bombs. Shreds emergency vehicles, nearby homes and apartment buildings. Kills Saudi rescuers by the bushel. Fran is crushed by a flying portable light standard. Rex is blown into the man handing out coffee. The walking wounded get decimated. \n29   EXT. AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPLEX - NEXT MOMENT               29 \nSlowly lift up and hold on Al-Rahmah as it burns. Black smoke and flame pour skyward from the site of the coup de grace explosion. Massive crater. Screams. Chaos postcard. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   16. \n29A   EXT. WASHINGTON, DC HOUSE - DAY                             29A \nEstablishing shot. \n29B   INT. FRAN MANNER'S WASHINGTON, DC HOUSE - DAY               29B \nFleury sits with GLENDA MANNER... a toy remote-control robot comes into the room. Little Teddy Manner (5) peeks his head around the corner of a door. \nGLENDA It was... I don't know what time it was... the dishwasher's broken...I was waiting for the dishwasher... The doorbell rang - I thought it was... it wasn't the dishwasher guy...It wasn't. It wasn't. \nGlenda breaks down, starts to completely lose it. Her little boy Teddy climbs up onto his mother. \n29C   INT. FRAN MANNER'S HOUSE - TEDDY'S ROOM - LATER             29C \nFleury sits on the bed with little Teddy looking at a beautiful black and white photo of Fran holding a new born Teddy up over his head. Eye to eye. \nLittle Teddy shows Fleury his toy helicopter. His dad's soldier boots. \nFleury can't take it. \n29D   INT. FRAN MANNER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM   - LATER            29D \nFleury stands with Glenda. \nFLEURY Glenda, I want you to look at me. \nA PAUSE: Fleury freezes up on a shock of raw emotion, struggling to contain himself. \nFLEURY (CONT'D) Please... I'm going to take care of this. Whoever did this... I give you my word. Whoever did this will pay. I can't change this, but I can promise you that I will make someone pay for this. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06    17. \n30   INT. HOOVER BUILDING, FBI HEADQUARTERS - DAY, EST           30 \nStartling quiet in contrast. AGENTS cluster beneath 32-inch Televisions suspended from the ceiling. Tuned to Al-Jazeera, CNN, BBC, etc. Most eyes focus on the double-bloody scoops from CNN. Volume low: \nCNN REPORTER ...1 hour ago: blasts in Saudi Arabia, in or around the `Al- Rahmah' western housing complex near Riyadh. More than 100 feared dead, including children. The Saudi Foreign Minister has released a statement calling this a `heinous act possibly committed by foreigners...' \n", "test2_true": "Fleury walks under the televisions. A folder in-hand, heading down a long hallway, subordinating his fury to tasks-at-hand. \n31   INT. COMMAND & TACTICAL OPERATIONS CENTER (CTOC) - NEXT     31 MOMENT \nFleury enters, steps to a podium, opens his folder. 50 Agents seated lecture hall-style. Steam from fifth, sixth cups of coffee. Plasma screens behind show still-images of the crime cribbed from Al-Jazeera. \nThroughout the scene, Fleury constantly refers to a roster of his ERTs. \nRONALD FLEURY Numbers so far: 100+ dead, 200+ injured. The target was a softball game. Rumor is the Killers wore Saudi police uniforms. (beat) Special Agent Fran Manner was killed. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06     18. \nJANET MAYES, 29 years-old, stifles a sob in the front row. Fleury steps from behind the podium, puts a hand gently on Janet's shoulder, leans in and whispers something no one but Janet hears. Whatever his words, they give back her composure. She nods. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) So was Rex Burr from State. \nFleury lets the news absorb as he steps back to the podium. No one says a thing. Fleury lifts his eyes again, real trouble maintaining control... \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) Fran was the best among us...we'll feel this loss the rest of our days... (beat, moment to regroup) Grant, take stabs at bomb sizes. \nGRANT SYKES. 50 years-old. Virginia State Trooper before joining the FBI. Law-and-order formidable: sharp-smart Charlottesville accent. Studies the images for a beat... \nGRANT SYKES From the craters, looks like they used a High Explosive... possibly military grade: can't fit that much TNT into a vest. 20, 30 pounds of PETN: they got it. Semtex or C-4: they could get it. The third there, God knows...that crater looks like a plane dropped a 500-pounder... \nRONALD FLEURY Obviously a secondary blast after the initial devices used to lure first responders to the scene. Don't know anything about where or what it was yet. \nGRANT SYKES This is how they do it. \nADAM LEAVITT. 34 years-old, sought-after Investigator. There's a constant, intense grind to this guy, a mind and mouth incapable of quiet. He paces around the room, then eagle-eyes the bomb images... starts surge-scrawling crude diagrams of the blast site on a piece of loose leaf. Feels more like nervous doodling than work. Not looking up from his drawing: \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   19. \nADAM   LEAVITT I already know   the answer, but any chance in Hell   we get to go over there, use our   hands? \nRONALD FLEURY If you already know the answer Adam, why ask the question? \nFleury circles Leavitt's name on the roster. Leavitt never stops drawing. \nSYKES We're not seeing this kind of planning and execution anywhere else...these ain't hot-wired artillery shells waiting for Humvees to roll by. (pointing at the screens) These hits are coordinated: planning, timing, and big, broad- daylight balls- \nJANET MAYES (almost trance-studying the images) Yeah, So... did they all happen during daylight? \nAnother great question. Fleury looks over to AGENT #1 on his immediate right, an egg-head type with a big binder in front of him. Everyone's eyes follow. Agent #1 flips quickly through the binder, back-and-forth, searching. Fleury crosses his name off of his roster. Then: \nAGENT #1 Yes. At least the first parts of the attacks. \nEveryone smells it: that's big -- more proof these attacks are being carried out by one, very skilled Terror Cell. \nJANET MAYES We had two others...North of Riyadh and the oil thing. What was that? \nADAM LEAVITT The Refinery... Ras Tenura Refinery. \nJANET MAYES Yeah, south of Jeddah. Same thing: daylight, suicide bombers. Right? (MORE) \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   20. \nJANET MAYES (CONT'D) Same thing. Followed by machine gun crews. Collect and kill. \nADAM LEAVITT Yup. \nRONALD FLEURY This is not new in concept. It is new in scope. It's bigger. Very sophisticated. Command and control was flawless. They found the largest kill zone they could and they did it... they did it by being patient. \nADAM LEAVITT Any rumors or confirmations of uniforms being used in the other two attacks? \nFleury circles Mayes' name on the ERT roster. \nAGENT #1 (from memory) No. I know this is the first for that. \nGRANT SYKES That's `worst case scenario' if you're still asking for my stab, Sir. A crew who can build bombs this big, with this level of eyes- on control and detonation coordination... has access to Saudi uniforms now...I mean...Baby Jesus. \nLEAVITT Anyone take credit? \nFleury checks from his notes. \nFLEURY Abu Hamza. Saudi Al-Qaeda. Bin- Laden-wanna-be. We know he was in Afghanistan, then moved to Iraq. Now he seems to have come home. He's clearly becoming increasingly active... \nADAM LEAVITT If it is Hamza, he's definitely turning up the volume over there. (MORE) \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   21. \nADAM LEAVITT (CONT'D) Not to beat a dead horse, Sir, but if there was ever a time to get boots on Saudi sand... \nSykes studies Leavitt with what is best described as substantial skepticism. Fleury circles Sykes' name on his roster. \nJANET MAYES They can't afford to appear as if they are losing any kind of control. They lose control over their country, their people...then they risk losing control over the oil. They won't let us in. No way. \nFleury's P.O.V.: His open folder on the podium. A memo printed on Department of State letterhead. Pulls the memo, reads it aloud, calm laced with rage. \nRONALD FLEURY From the State Department, one hour ago: `We are in agreement with the Saudi security assessment that any additional American presence on Kingdom soil represents reckless risk. Therefore it is the Secretary of State's position that only after the situation has been evaluated and contained, should the Federal Bureau of Investigation activate Rapid Deployment.' (folding the memo) The National Security Advisor and the Attorney General agreed. (beat) I'm going to get us access. Keep your go bags hot. It's gonna come fast. \nLeavitt stares at Fleury as he moves fast out of the room. \nADAM LEAVITT (beat) Well... I guess he's gonna go get us some access. (beat) How's he gonna do that? \n", "test2_id": 2548, "test3_input": "COLONEL AL-GHAZI If America figures out a way of keeping their kids off the computers please let us know. \nRONALD FLEURY Why did he turn himself in? \nBefore Al-Ghazi can answer, Talal begins talking to him in Arabic.

Al-Ghazi continues the translation: \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) The Man who made War on Al-Rahmah is someone my age -- this kind of skill is learned over decades. \nTalal looks at Fleury now, speaking directly to him through Al-Ghazi: \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (CONT'D) A Man who can plan the mass-murder of women and children, then go home at night to his own and sleep soundly...? That kind of Man is supremely difficult to catch. \nRONALD FLEURY (through Al-Ghazi) How does he know he slept soundly? \nColonel Al-Ghazi hesitates, then relays Fleury's question. Talal stares: eyes touched by war-blood-atrocities committed. Someone who believes he's going to Hell. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (translating) Because he hasn't stopped. You stop when their faces don't let you close your eyes... \nRONALD FLEURY (through Al-Ghazi) Is that why you quit? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (translating) 17 days without sleep will make you quit anything. \nTwo TEENAGERS stick their heads into the office. They're mad about the sharing of a computer. Talal puts a fast stop to it. It's obvious he's good with these young boys. He smiles as he speaks to Al-Ghazi. \nAl-Ghazi translates to Fleury. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   103. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) He says he makes my job easier. Here, at least they only fight and kill on computers. \nAl-Ghazi shows Talal the detonator. The old man studies it. Al-Ghazi and Talal speak in Arabic about the detonator. \nAl-Ghazi looks to Fleury, translates. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) He says that there are several ways to get American military equipment like this detonator but not many men in Saudi Arabia that know how to get them. \nFLEURY How do they get them? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Usually smuggled from Iraq by corrupt soldiers working with the Americans. \nFLEURY Could Hamza get this equipment? \nAl-Ghazi asks Talal. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Without question. Yes, he could. \nRONALD FLEURY (through Al-Ghazi) How do we find him? \nHe thinks for a moment, then speaks. The boys chuckle as Al- Ghazi continues translating: \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Prayer. Luck. Handshakes. \nFleury looks at Al-Ghazi, doesn't quite get it... \nRONALD FLEURY (to Al-Ghazi) Well, I think I get the `prayer' and `luck' parts... \nTalal slowly stands, Al-Ghazi helping him up, moves to Fleury. Reaches his hand out to him, quietly: \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   104. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.)

Another sizeable scoop down about two feet:   nothing. Haytham now stands over the crater watching Sykes.   Leavitt has joined him. \nGRANT SYKES Whatever this is, it blasted-off like NASA. \nHaytham yells to the Machine Operator in Arabic: \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM Driven in at an angle... go deeper... \nAnother gouge of earth: 4 feet.

The kind used in ambulances. Nozzle assembly gone, burst in the explosion with a force that drove it several feet into solid ground. Haytham takes a razor blade, scratches off samples of the soil and carbon for explosive residue into a fresh cannister.

Leavitt tags evidence from the shootout. \nAl-Ghazi hangs up, looks to Fleury. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI The ambulance was reported stolen from King Fahd Hospital last Wednesday, three days before the bombing. \nRONALD FLEURY OK. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI There's more: I told you it wouldn't be hard to find the soldiers. \nRONALD FLEURY (focused; to Al-Ghazi) What you got? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI The stolen ambulance had a twenty man crew that rotated shifts on it. We checked all twenty men. One of them, Muaath Hazmi is now of interest to us. \nRONALD FLEURY Why? \nAl-Ghazi reaches for the photo of the dead shooter/attacker. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Because this gentleman is Fathi Hazmi, Muaath's brother. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   106. \nRONALD FLEURY Where's Muaath? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI I'm going to show you. \n108   EXT. SUBURBAN RIYADH STREET - AFTERNOON                    108 \nA five block radius has been sealed off by Police Vehicles. Fleury and his team are at the outer perimeter, crouched behind barricades at the entrance of a cul-de-sac. They're not allowed anywhere near the line of fire. \nThey sport bullet-proof vests and helmets: look like reporters in a war-zone. Police turn away cars, neighbors. Snipers stand posted on near-by rooftops. Helicopters audible overhead. Street deserted. \nGRANT SYKES We never get to do anything fun. \nJANET MAYES Sykes, I'm guessing you don't even remember how to load your gun. \nGRANT SYKES That's not funny. \nADAM LEAVITT She's not trying to be funny. \nGRANT SYKES I'm a very good shot. \nJANET MAYES I'm sure. \nHaytham hands Al-Ghazi a walkie-talkie, in Arabic: \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Neighbors clear? \nVOICE (O.S.) Yes. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Activity or communication? \nVOICE (O.S.) Snipers have seen nothing. No telephone line into the house. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   107. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (beat) Allahuakbar. Go. \nTwo black Suburbans roll around the corner: out-fitted with running boards and hand rails upon which a 12-man SWAT team rides: 3 on each rail, 2 vehicles. SWAT team: military fatigues, black hoods, Mp-5 close-quarter sub-machine guns. Flying down the cul-de-sac: Half-way down the street, one of the Snipers open fire: BOOM-BOOM-BOOM. That moment an RPG fires wide of the lead Suburban. Over Al-Ghazi's walkie- talkie, in Arabic: \nVOICE (O.S.) ONE DOWN! RPG! \nThe two SWAT-Teamers at the front of the running boards open up with their MP-5s one-handed: the front of the house puffs, bursts, disintegrates. Suburbans rip to a stop. SWAT off, move fast. Three toss flash grenades into and around the house. Massive flash-bangs. Six through the front door. Six sprinting around back. Loud AK-47 bursts from inside now...screams. Then an RPG fired inside: the rushing sound and yellow-white flash past two windows. A section of the far left wall of the house detonates from the inside out. \nMore mechanical, silenced thwacks from the SWAT Mp-5s. Silence. Then voices from Al-Ghazi's walkie-talkie. Ambulances round the corner, fly toward the house: \nVOICE (O.S.) (CONT'D) CLEAR. \n109   INT. TARGETED HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER                         109 \nThe team enters, wide-eyed. Four men in civilian garb, all dead: multiple bullet wounds. An Officer with four 8 X 10 mug- shots, matching them to the dead faces, dropping mug-shots on respective chests. Once he's finished, a police photographer takes new pictures of each. At the far side of the House: engineers use 2x4s to support the wall hit with the RPG. All of it has the feel of standard Saudi operation procedure. \nAl-Ghazi appears from the back of the house. Bends over each of the four dead men: lifting each of their hands, examining the backs of the hands quickly. \nGRANT SYKES Prints are on the other side... \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   108. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI I'm not looking for prints. I'm looking for fingers. \nStands after the last: a look of controlled frustration that Fleury files. Then Al-Ghazi motions to Sykes and Fleury. \n110   INT. REAR OF THE HOUSE - NEXT MOMENT                       110 \nBack to the rear of the house: stacks of plastic explosives, buckets of shrapnel, two Paramedics working feverishly on a SWAT Officer hit multiple times. Fleury goes about his business like a man isn't dying six feet away. \nSykes is a kid in a candy store: rummaging through explosives, blasting caps, shrapnel. \n", "test3_id": 2549}

WASHINGTON, DC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY                   2 \nWe're in a kindergarten classroom of 25 SIX YEAR OLDS. All sitting on the floor, legs crossed. Sitting in front of the kids is Little KEVIN FLEURY, flanked by his mom LYLA FLEURY and his dad RONALD FLEURY, in a dark suit. \nLittle Kevin has a large cardboard square with pictures from different stages of his life taped to it. He's telling the class about the photos. \nWe're TIGHT ON the pictures. TIGHT ON the young faces. TIGHT ON Fleury. \nKEVIN FLEURY This is my Fredricksburg house and my grandma Ruth playing with my skateboard ramp. It's a Tony Hawk jump ramp. \nA little girl, MICK raises her hand. \nKEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) Mick? \nSilence from Mick \nMICK I forgot what I was going to say. \nKevin points to another picture. \nKEVIN FLEURY This is me at my second birthday party with my mom and my dad. That's my cake. \nFleury looks down sweet at his son. \nKEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) This is me with my mom at the zoo and this is my dad and me and my grandpa Willie. \nKevin points to another photo. \nKEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) And this is me and my dad and my grandpa Willie at my dad's office. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   2. \nThe kids all lean forward and squirm as they try and get closer to the pictures. MISS ROSS, the pretty twenty five year old teacher watches from the side. \nMICK Where's your gun? \nLITTLE BOY Yeah, where is your gun? \nPretty much all the kids get in on this now. Everyone wants to see Fleury's gun. Fleury makes eyes at Miss Ross. She's giving him a `no fucking way' hard eye. \nFLEURY I'm assuming that there are no bad guys in this room. Isn't that right? I mean, are you guys good guys or bad guys? \nTHE WHOLE CLASS GOOD GUYS! \nFLEURY Right. So why would I have brought my gun to a room full of good guys? \nThis silences the class. Miss Ross keeps things moving, pointing to a photo. \nMISS ROSS What's that picture? \nKEVIN FLEURY This is me and my dad playing Battleship at my dad's apartment. \nMick's hand goes back up. \nKEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) Mick? \nMICK What is a battleship? \nKEVIN FLEURY (abruptly) My parents are divorced. \nA beat. Lyla and Ron look down at Kevin, stalled... \nKINGDOM 8/18/06    3. \nKEVIN FLEURY (CONT'D) But that's OK `cause the most important thing is to know that everybody loves each other. \nThis hits a bit hard on Lyla and Ron. Miss Ross jumps in. \nMISS ROSS So, who's that in that picture up on top? \nKEVIN FLEURY That's my fish, his name is Jaws and he's a really mean fish. \nCONTINUED: \n3   OMITTED - SEE 68A                                                3 \n4   INT. WASHINGTON DC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL- CONTINUOUS                 4 \nKevin is still going strong. \nKEVIN FLEURY My mommy is a Think Tank worker and she is really, really smart. She went to two colleges and has three computers. \nCONTINUED: \n5   OMITTED - SEE 78A, 87                                            5 \n6   INT. WASHINGTON DC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY                       6 \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   14. \nRONALD FLEURY I'm gonna try... \nLooks at Lyla who's been through this drill too many times, knows this face. Ronald can only give a little shrug, which Lyla gives right back. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) (to Lyla) Can you get a ride? \nShe nods yes. Miss Ross nearby, surprised by this: \nMISS ROSS Where's your husband going? \nLYLA FLEURY Ex-husband, and God knows. \nThen a wave of fear ripples across her face. She hesitates, then calls after him: \nLYLA FLEURY (CONT'D) BE SAFE. \nRonald turns, gives a little Cheshire grin, puts the phone back up to his ear. \n28   EXT. AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPOUND BLAST SITES - EVENING         28 \nThe shattered softball diamond and parking lot. Emergency lights swirl from everywhere. Acrid smoke. \nFRANCIS MANNER (FBI LEGAT, US Embassy) is giant. The kind of American that only grows in tiny southern hamlets. Military whitewalls, short-sleeves, khaki Dockers, a thick Casio G- shock, FBI credentials visible on a chain. \nHangs up his phone. Lifts his eyes: Hell from one side of the frame to the other. Saudi teams setting up portable lights that bathe the horror in industrial incandescent. Columns of black smoke. Fleets of emergency vehicles. 100 uniformed men. Another 200 in bio-suits combing the ball field, the parking lot. Fran has to do something/anything. \nMove through the horror with him now. His hands shake, his face already dirty with soot. Jumps in with a Saudi team pulling a half-burned WOMAN out of a smoldering Range Rover. She fights them, gouging Fran's face, trying to get back in. \nShe is the woman we met at the gate of the compound.    She wants her baby. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   15. \nFran bloodied, just kind of steps away from the woman. Leaves the Saudi emergency team to fight with her. Backs away until he feels grass under his feet. The woman's screams reverberate. Fran just sits in the grass. Staring at the woman, her shattered soul. Forces himself to look away. Eyes come to rest on a child's baseball cap: ragged holes ringed with black stains: where blood dried on the blue felt. \nVOICE (O.C.) (immediately behind) Fran. You gotta stand Big Man... \nFran turns to find REX BURR: 5'7\" fireplug. A long silence. Fran points to the hat: \nFRANCIS MANNER Rex, how old were you when your hat was that small? \nWe watch tears well in Rex's eyes... \nREX BURR You gotta stand, Big Man. \nFran does. Wipes his hands on his pants. Slack-jaw hopeless. The first moments in what will be weeks of reverse- engineering the murders of unknown dozens. He and Rex step to a group of WALKING-WOUNDED. A NEIGHBOR doles out mugs of coffee. Most everyone from the compound is out, pondering the proximity. SAUDI emergency teams sprint past. Fran spits, settles in: \nFRANCIS MANNER We need to get everyone back, then get all their- \nSOMETHING HUGE EXPLODES over their shoulders, 50 yards away. The Attack's coup de grace: wait for people to lift up their heads, hit them again. Five times the size of the suicide bombs. Shreds emergency vehicles, nearby homes and apartment buildings. Kills Saudi rescuers by the bushel. Fran is crushed by a flying portable light standard. Rex is blown into the man handing out coffee. The walking wounded get decimated. \n29   EXT. AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPLEX - NEXT MOMENT               29 \nSlowly lift up and hold on Al-Rahmah as it burns. Black smoke and flame pour skyward from the site of the coup de grace explosion. Massive crater. Screams. Chaos postcard. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   16. \n29A   EXT. WASHINGTON, DC HOUSE - DAY                             29A \nEstablishing shot. \n29B   INT. FRAN MANNER'S WASHINGTON, DC HOUSE - DAY               29B \nFleury sits with GLENDA MANNER... a toy remote-control robot comes into the room. Little Teddy Manner (5) peeks his head around the corner of a door. \nGLENDA It was... I don't know what time it was... the dishwasher's broken...I was waiting for the dishwasher... The doorbell rang - I thought it was... it wasn't the dishwasher guy...It wasn't. It wasn't. \nGlenda breaks down, starts to completely lose it. Her little boy Teddy climbs up onto his mother. \n29C   INT. FRAN MANNER'S HOUSE - TEDDY'S ROOM - LATER             29C \nFleury sits on the bed with little Teddy looking at a beautiful black and white photo of Fran holding a new born Teddy up over his head. Eye to eye. \nLittle Teddy shows Fleury his toy helicopter. His dad's soldier boots. \nFleury can't take it. \n29D   INT. FRAN MANNER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM   - LATER            29D \nFleury stands with Glenda. \nFLEURY Glenda, I want you to look at me. \nA PAUSE: Fleury freezes up on a shock of raw emotion, struggling to contain himself. \nFLEURY (CONT'D) Please... I'm going to take care of this. Whoever did this... I give you my word. Whoever did this will pay. I can't change this, but I can promise you that I will make someone pay for this. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06    17. \n30   INT. HOOVER BUILDING, FBI HEADQUARTERS - DAY, EST           30 \nStartling quiet in contrast. AGENTS cluster beneath 32-inch Televisions suspended from the ceiling. Tuned to Al-Jazeera, CNN, BBC, etc. Most eyes focus on the double-bloody scoops from CNN. Volume low: \nCNN REPORTER ...1 hour ago: blasts in Saudi Arabia, in or around the `Al- Rahmah' western housing complex near Riyadh. More than 100 feared dead, including children. The Saudi Foreign Minister has released a statement calling this a `heinous act possibly committed by foreigners...' \nSykes just hard-eyes Leavitt. \n31A   SEE 29A - 29D (MOVED, NOT OMITTED)                          31A \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   22. \n32   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - UNKNOWN TIME              32 \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI, Saudi Police, 45 years-old, mustache as thick as Sykes'. A firecracker-loud crack makes him flinch. He stands in the back of the room, not participating in the interrogation. Just observing. Clearly not happy about what he's observing. \nHis POV: The Officer from the second Land Cruiser that rammed the fake and killed those inside, Sergeant Haytham. slab- cuffed and being worked over hard buy a couple of thick- fisted SAUDIS.. Silent tears roll off his cheek, left ear split ghastly. A MAN standing far right of him beats him: the firecracker sound again. \nAl-Ghazi looks away, biting his tongue. Obviously wants this over. \nIn-charge of the interrogation: GENERAL ABDUL MALIK. He doesn't appear sadistic, but very determined to get the truth from Sergeant Haytham by any means necessary. Those distinctions blur easily. Malik gives a `hold-up' signal. The following exchange in Arabic: \nGENERAL ABDUL-MALIK No falsehoods, Sergeant Haytham. What was your involvement? \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM Killing those I saw responsible. \nGENERAL ABDUL-MALIK So none could be questioned? \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM (puzzled, angry) I don't understand. \nA nod from General Malik: another vicious crack. \nGENERAL ABDUL-MALIK You were born and raised in Suweidi- \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM -that is not a crime- \nGENERAL ABDUL-MALIK -it should be. \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM It's not. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   23. \nGENERAL ABDUL MALIK Do you know Abu Hamza? \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM I do not. \nGENERAL ABDUL-MALIK Your brother was killed fighting the Americans. True or false? \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM I am not my brother. \nGENERAL ABDUL-MALIK Your brother-- \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM I am NOT my brother! \nGENERAL ABDUL-MALIK TRUE or- \nAl-Ghazi interrupts. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI He has answered the question. \nMalik shoots Al-Ghazi a unequivocal SHUT THE FUCK UP hard eye. Then back on Haytham. \nGENERAL ABDUL-MALIK We found six more uniforms than you were assigned in your possession -- that is a crime: especially when you consider the Attackers wore our Uniform... \nAnother nod, another crack. Al-Ghazi, flinching, becomes more alert. \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM Uniforms? \nGeneral Malik in Haytham's face: \nGENERAL ABDUL-MALIK Truth! \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM I sweat. I'll say it again because it is true. I need more uniforms because I must change during shifts...look at my shirts. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06     24. \nGENERAL ABDUL-MALIK I am not interested in your sweat. \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM -then look at my jackets. Please. Permanent stains...no matter how many times they're cleaned... \nColonel Al-Ghazi grimacing now, leaves the room. \n33   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD - STORAGE - NEXT MOMENT            33 \nWe follow. Al-Ghazi hustling into an evidence storage room. Searching. Finds a Locker labelled `Haytham.' Opens it. Pulls out several shirts still in the plastic dry-cleaning sheaths: yellowed, permanent stains on the armpits of each. \n34   INT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - INTERROGATION ROOM        34 \nAl-Ghazi walks back into the room with the shirts, lays them down on the table in front of the General -- all business. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI He's telling the truth. \nThe only sound for a long, unsettled moment: Sergeant Haytham's labored breathing. Malik looks at the shirts, then Al-Ghazi, hesitates, steps away. \nGENERAL ADBUL-MALIK You were injured when you used your vehicle to protect your country. Do you understand? \nAl-Ghazi moves in, begins uncuffing Haytham's bloody-raw wrists, hard-eyeing Malik the whole time. These men clearly don't like each other. \n35   EXT. SAUDI NATIONAL GUARD PRISON - LATER                     35 \nAl-Ghazi and Haytham sit alone. Al-Ghazi smokes. Haytham looks down at his feet. \nELLIS LEACH I met with Prince Thamer at the Saudi embassy fifteen minutes after I heard this morning's news. After speaking with Thamer, I advised we withhold additional US personnel because a big part of the religious justification for these bombs is the presence of current US personnel. More boots on Saudi soil make an already combustible situation more so. I know that's not the answer you want, but... \nMotions to Maricella: the floor is yours. \nMARICELLA CANAVESIO My two cents: The Saudis haven't asked for FBI help. Sounds like they've done just the opposite. If we force the issue, that could further anger an utterly important ally that shares a 1000-mile long border with Iraq. \nGIDEON YOUNG (to Grace and Fleury) It's all rock-solid logic. \nDIRECTOR GRACE (beat) We would just like to be on record as saying we think we should go ASAP- \nGIDEON YOUNG That's not going to happen \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   29. \nYoung stands: we're done. Fleury's look: that's it? Young's already collecting his briefcase, jacket- \nGIDEON YOUNG (CONT'D) (mock sincerity to the room:) -so as we present this to the public, let's - as best we can - try to view this through an FBI Agent's eyes. (beat...To Grace:) And please let me know if there's anything else we can do for you. \nMeeting seems over. Not quite. Fleury can't keep his mouth shut. \nRONALD FLEURY Sir, how would you imagine it looks viewed through an FBI agents eyes? \nGIDEON YOUNG Pardon me? \nRONALD FLEURY I'm interested in how you think this situation is viewed through our eyes. \nYoung, eyes on a Republican-gold Rolex, instantly perturbed the meeting isn't ending. \nGIDEON YOUNG It's some variation on vengeance... When one of your own is killed, Agents lose their analytical powers - kind of a greatest strength, greatest weakness thing... \nRONALD FLEURY If I wanted vengeance, I'd have whispered `Rex Burr' into Ellis's ear right when we walked in. (beat) \nEyes migrate to Fleury -- \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) This isn't Terrorism, ma'am. It's just Serial Murder. \nMARICELLA CANAVESIO What's the distinction? \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   30. \nRONALD FLEURY To call this massacre an act of terrorism... that implies a specific political agenda. To me, these killings are so futile and unbalanced that they feel utterly sociopathic- more like Charles Manson than Osama Bin Laden... \nFleury looks to Mayes. She clears her throat. Delivers the following with utter precision. \nJANET MAYES (beat, fuck it: Go) Al Qaeda lost the first phase of this war, so a new, zero-sum phase has begun: if you won't join us, we'll let loose the truly talented Murderers... Abu Hamza. He will kill so many of you that the resulting humiliation of the Saudi Royal Family will cause an exodus, a rebellion, both. Because the Royal Family simply cannot protect you or yours any longer. \nFleury studies Janet with solid respect. He gives Janet a subtle nod: \"Nice work.\" \nRONALD FLEURY When she says talented, she's not talking about the walking-bombs who can sneak past any and all security, nor the hi-jackers tough enough to take an airliner. We're talking about the Man who teaches them how... \nJANET MAYES --the operational commander who organizes, trains, plans, encourages. That is who we're fighting. \nRONALD FLEURY If we don't get inside Saudi Arabia within 36 hours, there is no chance we catch the killer responsible for Al-Rahmah. None. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   31. \nELLIS LEACH Okay. I believe it all. So doesn't your team in that country represent the kind of target one of these `Masters' would die for? Trade ten of their own for one of you? \nRONALD FLEURY To not engage these criminals out of fear for our personal safety is just another way of saying `uncle.' \nFleury takes another deep breath. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) I'll say it another way: Evidence starts to go cold after twenty four hours. If we can't get in now, we will not find the man or men responsible for this crime. We couldn't do it at Khobar; we couldn't do it in Yemen; we have barely scratched the surface in Iraq. And we are on verge of not doing it here. They are getting stronger, we are getting weaker. I just lost a very good friend and I would very much like to go and do my job. \nBeat. \nGIDEON YOUNG (chuckle) That was spirited... let's all thank God Special Agent Fleury doesn't make policy decisions. He'd turn the FBI into Patton's Third Army. \nYoung stands. Fleury contemplates career-ending violence. \n38   EXT. WASHINGTON D.C. - DAY                                  38 \nJanet, Fleury and Grace walking the rows of seven-foot bronze soldiers. Street-cart hotdogs from foil wrappers. \nDIRECTOR GRACE (to Fleury) I see the look in your eyes. That look is trouble: old school, play ground shit, vengeance... \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   32. \nRONALD FLEURY It's not vengeance. \nDIRECTOR GRACE It ain't justice. It's stronger. We've all been there. I have. Vengeance is always dirty, Ronnie. \nRONALD FLEURY I just can't sit this out. I can't watch this not get dealt with. Not again. (a beat...) Know what my high school football coach used to say to me? \nDIRECTOR GRACE What? \nRONALD FLEURY \"HIT SOMETHING.\" All night long, Coach Bailey would scream \"HIT SOMETHING.\" Every play. \nDIRECTOR GRACE That's good coaching. \nRONALD FLEURY I'm fixing to go hit something, boss. You with me? \nDIRECTOR GRACE How you gonna do it? \nRONALD FLEURY The Saudis covet good PR as much as their Oil: 15 of 19 hijackers on 9- 11 means most Americans will never stop asking if that Saudi Oil is worth it. It's all about press. \n41   INT. DIPLOMATIC SUBURBAN - MOMENTS LATER                   41 \nA big bodyguard sits up front. Fleury sits in back, aims the AC vents his way. Prince Thamer sits next to him. Bright lights from the trail suburban illuminate the interior. \nPrince Thamer looks more than a bit baffled. \nRONALD FLEURY Too many people we both know were at the bar. It's a pleasure to meet you, Your Highness. \nPRINCE THAMER I had an interesting conversation with a reporter from the Post. \nRONALD FLEURY She can be a bit of an exaggerator... I'm sure things were somewhat over-stated. I see myself as friend of Saudi Arabia. I just need a little cooperation, that's all. \nPRINCE THAMER What kind of cooperation?? \nRONALD FLEURY Full cooperation: my Team cleared to land at Prince Sultan Air Base. Tomorrow. We want to help in a very muscular way, quickly. \nPRINCE THAMER Next month would be as soon as... \nFleury takes a beat. \nRONALD FLEURY This goes one of two ways. First: The FBI with the White House go on the kind of aggressive PR \"Saudi Royal Family Decaying Monarchy\" bender that just can't help but hurt. Really hurt. And I don't care how many Chinese are lined up to buy the oil. You know it's gonna hurt. \nPRINCE THAMER My family is not decaying- \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   37. \nRONALD FLEURY And then we bring the hammer down hard as hell: Bust Al Haramain - we got direct links from Riyadh - two wives donating ten million to three Arab-American cultural centers in Boston. Then what gets kind of not- funny is how some of that cash found its way to Jakarta and some Mosques that have these training camps built right next to them. It's kinda funny... you got little kids playing over here, and some not so little kids playing with guns over here. That's kinda odd. \nPRINCE THAMER You have no proof of this. \nRONALD FLEURY We're getting there, Sir. And I haven't even brought up the two girls still missing out of Houston. This is big. It is real. And I know you only care so much about public American opinion, Sir. But the story will be covered... Big... \nThamer is clearly rattled. Fleury is starting to crack this man. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) And this ain't the Metro section. It's above the fold, just below the date. Words like these get syndicated to papers like the Omaha World-Herald, The Terrell Tribune -- You ever been to Terrell, Texas? \nPRINCE THAMER What is your point? \nFleury looks back to him. \nRONALD FLEURY Last I heard, 112 people lost their lives in your country. One of them was a good friend of mine. I want in and I want in immediately. \nThat's a rock solid answer. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   38. \nPRINCE THAMER Define \"immediately.\" \nRONALD FLEURY Right now immediately. \nFleury looks back at the Ambassador. A stare down. \nFLEURY If your phone doesn't work international, you can borrow mine. \nPrince Thamer slowly reaches for his phone as Fleury opens his door. \nFLEURY (CONT'D) I'll just be right out here. \n42   EXT. DIPLOMATIC SUBURBAN - MOMENTS LATER                     42 \nFleury waiting. Intense. \nThe window rolls down, Thamer looking up at Fleury. \nThe following is fast, tight negotiating: \nPRINCE THAMER (trying to maintain cool) We cannot allow 100 agents- \nRONALD FLEURY -4. With a 25-man security detail- \nPRINCE THAMER -even 25 more armed Americans could spark rebellion- \nRONALD FLEURY That's too bad. \nPRINCE THAMER Saudi Security. That's non negotiable. You cannot bring guns into the Kingdom. \nRONALD FLEURY Men in Saudi Police uniforms are why we're talking now. \nPRINCE THAMER They would be hand picked. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   39. \nRONALD FLEURY Whose hands? \nPRINCE THAMER Mine. \nFleury blinks. \nPRINCE THAMER (CONT'D) Trust me...that's the only hope of this happening. \nFLEURY If anything happens to me or my team... It's on you. Understood? \nPRINCE THAMER Cool it with the John Wayne, Mr. Fleury. \nFleury just stares. \nLEAVITT Actually, I didn't volunteer. \nFLEURY Thanks anyway. \nLEAVITT We're going to Riyadh? \nFLEURY Yup. \nSYKES State department said yes? \nFLEURY Nope. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   43. \nLEAVITT White House said yes? \nFLEURY Nope. \nLEAVITT Anybody said yes? \nFLEURY Not really. \nLEAVITT Are we bringing security? \nFLEURY Nope. \nFleury walks onto the plane. Leaving the three on the tarmac. \nLEAVITT This is going to suck so bad. \nAnd the three follow Fleury onto the massive plane. \n48   OMITTED                                                      48 \n49   INT. C-130, AIRBORNE - LATER                                 49 \nSilent. Just the lull of jet engines. The big, long boring is just beginning. \nJanet and Leavitt play Scrabble. Sykes sits nearby. Fleury sits up front, wide awake. \nADAM LEAVITT What can four people do in five days? Really? \nGRANT SYKES Aren't you the one who demanded to go this morning? \nADAM LEAVITT I meant the FBI. I didn't mean \"me.\" \nSmall smile from Leavitt. The Scrabble continues... \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   44. \nADAM LEAVITT (CONT'D) (to Janet) What's it like on the ground? \nGRANT SYKES Mars. \nJANET MAYES I'll be looked at with what I can only describe as disdain, pretty much the entire time we're on the ground... kind of like South Virginia. \nGRANT SYKES Go easy on my kin. \nJANET MAYES It's a very confused culture. Extremely religious. Had nothing; wanted nothing. Sixty years ago, they hit oil. Simple religious men become trillionaires... a schizophrenic nation is born. The royal family, who we back, and everyone else. \nIntercut with the Scrabble. \n50   OMITTED (SEE 42A) THRU 53                                     50 \n54   EXT. PALACE GROUNDS - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME                       54 \nThree-Suburban convoy turns up a driveway, waved past a guard post bristling with automatic weapons and into the circular drive of a massive, walled palace. Impersonal wealth. Two dozen SANG troops on security detail. Two Humvees equipped with anti-aircraft missiles parked 100 yards apart. \nColonel Al-Ghazi out of the middle Suburban. Frisked by SANG, rough: no love lost. \n55   INT. IMPERSONAL PALACE - SAME MOMENT                          55 \nAl-Ghazi is passed to a silent, boundless staff holding serving platters jammed with cups of mint tea. A mammoth foyer. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   45. \nPRINCE SA'AD BIN KHALED (Saudi Interior Ministry) steps out from a 20-foot high doorway: nebbish, thin, bloodshot eyes magnified by thick glasses. His hand over his stomach: Napoleon's ulcers. A quick wave to Al-Ghazi. \n56   INT. PRINCE'S PRIVATE OFFICE - NEXT MOMENT                    56 \n10' X 20' gold/glass desk over a 50' X 50' rug in a 100' X 100' marble room. Al-Ghazi greets the Prince formally: kiss the right shoulder near the clavicle. The Prince's tongue chalk-white for some reason. In Arabic: \nPRINCE BIN KHALED Four FBI Agents will be allowed to land at Prince Sultan Air Base this evening. \nAl-Ghazi: more than mild shock. \nPRINCE BIN KHALED (CONT'D) General Abdul-Malik, Chief of Investigative Services for the National Guard has been put in- charge of solving this crime. \nClearly not sitting well with Al-Ghazi. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI I know the General. I attended his interrogation of one of my men. (beat, putting it kindly:) The General does not have investigative experience. \nPRINCE BIN KHALED Attackers wore YOUR uniform. Police Uniforms. Some of your men may have been involved with this Cell, may still be involved. You're lucky to have a role at all. \nAl-Ghazi silent. The Prince pulls an anti-acid tablet, puts it in his mouth: that's why his tongue is chalk-white. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Sunrise. \nRONALD FLEURY What time is sunrise? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (beat) When I knock. \nAl-Ghazi and Haytham leave. The doors close behind them, then the sound of a key turning in a lock. The Americans look on, half-disbelief, half-comedy: locking us in. \nGRANT SYKES That's against fire code. \nJANET MAYES They don't have fire codes. They don't have codes other than codes of war. They'll lock us in and dial up some kind of earth movers if they want to. You know that, Sykes. Dig a big hole and push us in. Fill it up and no one comes calling. You're in the jungle now, baby. \nSilence as the crew digests this odd little verbal outage. \nADAM LEAVITT (smiling) You alright, girl? \nJANET MAYES Watch it, boy. \nADAM LEAVITT Just asking... \nJANET MAYES Unpack. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   57. \nEveryone hits their own bags first. \nFLEURY (to himself) Saudi slow roll... \nFleury pulls out his laptop, wakes it up from sleep mode. Eyes a photo of Kevin on his desktop, picks up the phone. \nLYLA FLEURY (on phone) Hello? \nRONALD FLEURY Hey... How are you? How's my boy? \nLYLA FLEURY We're just fine. How are you? Where are you? \nRONALD FLEURY I'm here... (quick beat) Lemme talk to my boy. \nA BEAT as Lyla passes the phone to Kevin. \nKEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Daddy? \nFLEURY What you doing? \nKEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) I'm talking to you. What are you doing right now, Daddy? Right now? \nFLEURY I'm missing you. \nKEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Where are you? \nFLEURY I'm in Saudi Arabia. \nKEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Did you see Big Fran? \nA Beat... \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   58. \nFLEURY Yeah... I saw him... (PAUSE) I saw him. \nKEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Is he still tall? \nFLEURY Yeah... Yeah...he's still tall. \nSilence... as Fleury takes a beat to collect himself. \nKEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Daddy? Are you still there? \nFLEURY Yeah, buddy. I love you. Keep your eye on your mama. Be the man. \nKEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) You, too Daddy. \nFLEURY I'll call you tomorrow. I love you. \nKEVIN FLEURY (O.S.) Bye, Daddy. \nFleury begins unpacking. \n68   EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - 4:30 AM                    68 \nPre-dawn: Eight black suburbans parked on the side street: waiting. The doors of the first four open in-unison. 20 Arab, suited SECURITY GUARDS exit. \nAl-Ghazi unlocks the door to the compound: the team stands dressed, waiting. CLOSE-UP: The Team steps out to see massive, organized security. \nFrom one of the vehicles exits a middle aged AMERICAN - sweating a bit, hanging back, watching. This is US Deputy Chief of Mission, the Embassy's second-in-command: DAMON SCHMIDT. \nAnother 100 Security CONTRACTORS remain vigilant: SNIPERS on roof-tops, in machine-gun nests. \nSchmidt approaches Fleury. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06    59. \nSCHMIDT (big smile) You are in so much trouble. \nFLEURY Is that right? \n100 soldiers immediately drop to their knees. \n69    INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER HOOPS COURT - 9:00 AM         69 \nTIGHT ON FLEURY: focused, Thinking. Sykes next to him. \nO.C. The Athan sounds again for Dhuhr. \nSYKES Well, this is going well... \nFLEURY Saudi Slow Roll. \nSykes and Fleury lean against the locked door, staring at the pathetic sight before them: Janet's truly awful jumper... that somehow swishes every time. Before she lands, cocky and smooth: \nJANET MAYES Good. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   63. \nThen the metallic swish of the all-weather net. Leavitt boxes out air for the non-existent rebound, grabs the ball, chest- passes it Great Santini-hard back to Janet who softly sucks in the pass. Playing in their cargo pants and hiking boots. \nLEAVITT How do you do that? \nJanet gently bounce-passes it back: \nJANET MAYES Check. \nLEAVITT Don't say `good' again. \nJanet takes the check from Leavitt: before he can react, she drains a 30-footer. Same cockiness, different word: \nJANET Bueno. \nFleury with Sykes still standing in the same spot. Looks up: Al-Ghazi coming into the building. Fleury ready to vent until something surprises him: breathless, Al-Ghazi has broken a wide-sweat hustling back to the Americans. Fleury's face relaxes. He pulls a bottle of water out of a cooler, hands it to Al-Ghazi. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI I am sorry for the time. (beat) You won't need you gear. \nFleury can't help a small smile. \nFLEURY (to Sykes, himself) Of course we won't. \n70   EXT. AL-RAHMAH - MOMENTS LATER                              70 \nHands in pockets. Soak in the aftermath: shallow but wide crater, shredded backstop, nearby buildings torn, blood baked into dirt. Fifteen cars. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) The remaining rules: you cannot touch evidence, question anyone without me present, touch Muslim dead, or leave my sight at anytime: your safety is my primary concern. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   64. \nFLEURY I would have thought your primary concern was investigating a crime. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI And you would be mistaken. \nSykes looks over to Fleury. Crooked smile. \nSYKES (to Fleury) I think it's one of those \"something happens to us... his head comes off\" kind of deals. (to Al-Ghazi) Is it one of those kind of deals, Colonel? \nAl-Ghazi ignores Sykes. \nFLEURY So, if you're not running the investigation...who is? \nAl-Ghazi motions to 50 MEN in uniforms different than his: SANG troops digging, bagging evidence, marking the scene with red-flags. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI The National Guard's Military Police Brigade is conducting the investigation. My orders begin and end with your health. \nThe Team: so we're on Tour. Fleury still silent. \nADAM LEAVITT I thought the SANG were soldiers-- \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI --the bombers didn't wear a soldier's uniform. They wore mine. \nFleury finally speaks, asking the most important question: \nRONALD FLEURY Who is in charge of the investigation then? \nAl-Ghazi points to a Man we've seen before, General Abdul- Malik. Haytham's Interrogator. He pours over a table 20 feet away: maps, blueprints, utility schematics spread before him. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   65. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI General Abdul-Malik. He's given us permission to walk through each crime-scene. \nRONALD FLEURY To walk through? Are you kidding me? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI I am not. \nStarting to get heated. \nRONALD FLEURY Get him over here now and let's clarify this situation. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI There is no lack of clarification. \nRONALD FLEURY There sure as hell is! I don't know what kind of game you're playing but you got the wrong guy, Colonel Al-Ghazi! That was not the deal- \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (getting hot) This is not a game show, Mr. Fleury! There are no deals made here. There is me telling you what you may or may not do and there is you doing it. \nBeat. As Al-Ghazi stabilizes... \nRONALD FLEURY Mr. Aaron Jackson? \nAARON JACKSON (re: Al-Ghazi) Get him away from me- \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   69. \nRONALD FLEURY -easy, Sir. He's a friend to us- \nAARON JACKSON -I don't know either one a' you. \nRONALD FLEURY I'm Special Agent Ronald Fleury of the FBI. This is Colonel Al-Ghazi with the Saudi State Police- \nAARON JACKSON -the Police: they attacked. \nAl-Ghazi quietly backs away, walks away. Fleury looks after him, turns back to Mr. Jackson who stares after Al-Ghazi: hate. Fleury unsure what to do next. \nAARON JACKSON (CONT'D) I just put my boys down for the first time in two days. I can't wake `em and sure as hell can't be gone if they stir on their own. \nRONALD FLEURY Can I come back? \nAARON JACKSON (too loud) WHY? \nRONALD FLEURY Your boys... \nJackson remembers the warning he just spoke... \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) To ask about two nights ago. \nFresh tears re-animate his face: \nAARON JACKSON When my wife's jaw was shot off in front of our sons? My sons who sat with her while she bled to death? Couldn't speak because she didn't have the bottom of her face and I wasn't home and my baby boys are destroyed for life and my five year- old had a box of band-aids in his hand when I finally got home? \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   70. \nSilence outside of Mr. Jackson's sobbing. Fleury sick to his stomach. Desperate to let this man alone. No eye contact. \nRONALD FLEURY ...I won't pretend to know... \nAaron Jackson settles, wipes away tears, appreciates the honesty. Then bites back into his rage: \nAARON JACKSON Kill everyone that had something to do with this. Everyone related to them. Everyone who knew them. (beat) And all you'd be doing is their recruiting for them... It's an entire generation: not small and isolated like they say. But a generation that thinks what they did to my wife, to my children, is a \"calling\"... \nRONALD FLEURY Up the street, there was a wreck, did you see any- \nAARON JACKSON -notice how it wouldn't take a lot to disguise your friend (points to Al-Ghazi) as a Mexican? Think he couldn't handle crossing our deserts? Look around! \nRONALD FLEURY Aaron- \nAARON JACKSON (explodes) -LET ME FINISH GOD DAMN YOU- \nA child's scream from inside. Piercing. Scary. Jackson goes red, clenched fists, steps to Fleury who takes an instinctive step backward, guard-up. Jackson stops, spins back inside. A door slam that rattles the plywood sheet covering the shattered window. The screams become night terror shrieks. \n74   EXT. JACKSON HOME                                            74 \nA LONG, SAD BEAT, as Fleury and Al-Ghazi stand alone in front of the Jackson house. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   71. \nRONALD FLEURY (to Al-Ghazi) Can we tour the compound? Can we please do that? \nSlow nod from Al-Ghazi. \n75   EXT. BOMB SITE - LATER                                      75 \nThe team tours the site. \nAs they fan out. They walk casually, but focused through the first bomb site. An inquisitive Mayes, already peering into a mostly in-tact car, halfway out of its parking spot. Al-Ghazi and Haytham watch the Americans like mother-hens. \nJANET MAYES He or she almost made it. \nFleury steps, looks inside: blood and safety glass coat the seat. Janet points to keys in the ignition: still at the `on' position. Then the stick-shift, pulled to the back right: reverse. The shift-knob bloody... \nJANET MAYES (CONT'D) (beat, quieter) Makes me think of the Trade Centers -- the people on the floors above the impacts -- no matter how fast or strong or smart you are, if you're in the wrong spot, `it' will not let you get away. \nFLEURY That's what makes this a War. \nSykes notices something on the ground... he picks up a military detonator, discretely hands it over to Fleury. Fleury quietly pockets it. \n76   EXT. THIRD BLAST SITE - MOMENTS LATER                       76 \nStructures 100 feet away look like they've been hit with a God-sized sawed-off. The crater: 25-feet wide, 7-feet deep. Blackened frames and bits of vehicles circle the crater. The bottom of the crater filled with water. A syphon-pump works overtime. No SANG Investigators around. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) About one hour into the rescue. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   72. \nADAM LEAVITT Hit a water main? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI No -- from the tanks of this fire engine: that's the water that didn't evaporate in the blast. \nAl-Ghazi points to a mass of black metal: looks like a fire truck the way a Jackson Pollock looks like the Mona Lisa. Leavitt and Grant stand back. Quiet: \nGRANT SYKES (eyes on Fleury) Hole is the case. See, there's \"evidence\" down in that hole. You understand evidence? Little things that are \"clues.\" Clues can be very helpful to a fella when he's trying to solve a crime. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI I understand that. \nJANET MAYES The same Mosque is enough to identify them, link them to a cell? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Yes. If the Mosque is in Suweidi. \nADAM LEAVITT Suweidi? \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   76. \nJANET MAYES Suweidi is a known militant stonghold. Al-Qaeda could recruit from storefronts. \nOn Fleury: he looks back at the homes, then up and around: He locks on the OBSERVATION BUILDING in the distance. \nFLEURY Can we go to check out some of these surrounding buildings? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Why? \nFLEURY Seems reasonable that the Planner had to observe and based on Hamza's past history, it's consistent that he would want to video the attack. Is that true? Is that accurate? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI That is true. \nRONALD FLEURY Well, in order to video, in order to observe, you need a view. \nFleury points to one particular building. \nFLEURY That building sees all three crime scenes. \nAl-Ghazi looks up to the building. Back to Fleury. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (beat) It's outside the walls- \nADAM LEAVITT -c'mon now. This is insane: we got enough security to invade Suweidi, let alone that building- \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI -no you don't. \nFLEURY (to Al-Ghazi, respectful) Could you ask? (MORE) \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   77. \nFLEURY (CONT'D) We're already seeing the crime- scenes individually -- why not all at once? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Any answer will take- \nFLEURY -time. I understand. \nFleury speaks slowly and clearly now: like he's cementing his words in his own head as he speaks them. \nFLEURY (CONT'D) You have to ask the General, then the General would ask the Prince. Does it go higher or is that... is the Prince the end of the chain? \nAl-Ghazi hesitates, can't help but be charmed. Fleury clearly knows when to step-on or lay-off the gas. He's smooth... and HIGHLY EFFECTIVE: Al-Ghazi nods `yes' to the strange half- question. \nFLEURY (CONT'D) We'll be at the Community Center. (beat) Janet, wanna play hoops? \n78   INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER HOOPS COURT - NOON           78 \nWe're in the big gym as our team sits and waits. Leavitt taps on a laptop. \nJanet shoots free throws by herself. \nJANET MAYES This is the kind of radical circumstance that could have seriously upped Shaq's free throw percentages. Take a man. Ship him off to Riyadh. No phones, constant threat of death, no girls, no hip hop. Nothing... just free throws. Shaq, he'd be shooting at least seventy percent. Lakers would still be together. Kobe and Shaq lovers forever. \nLeavitt calls to Fleury. \nLEAVITT Hey, Boss... check this out. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06     78. \nFleury moves over to Leavitt. Checks out the screen. \nLEAVITT (CONT'D) Just posted half hour ago. \nIMAGES ON THE COMPUTER: ARABIC EXTREMIST WEBSITE. Video footage shot from the rooftop of all three bombings and some of the machine gun killings. \nLEAVITT (CONT'D) So self congratulatory. Makes me sick. \nFleury studies the footage. Backs it up plays it again and again. \n78A   INT. LOCATION UNKNOWN - TIME UNKNOWN                        78A \nA set of stronger, younger, in-tact hands gently pours a mixture into a box now. Ball bearings, children's jacks, marbles, razor blades, roofing nails: everything malevolent densities and angles. Some pieces bounce out, run along the floor. The younger hands then start pressing/molding the pieces of soon-to-be shrapnel into the putty. \n79    EXT. RIYADH SUBURB NEAR COMPOUND - AFTERNOON                 79 \nFive car convoy moving quickly through the city. \n80    EXT. SPOTTER APARTMENT- LATER                                80 \nOur convoy pulls up in front of the apartment. They exit the vehicles. Our team stands surrounded by a 50-man security detail, rifle-stocks to shoulders. Double-time it - outside the walls now, hostile territory. Two-man sniper teams out front. Al-Ghazi ten steps ahead. \nA SANG five car security CREW pulls up, tracking Fleury and company. A stand off between the two police forces. \n81    EXT. SPOTTER APARTMENT - NEXT MOMENT                         81 \nThe SANG Officer in-charge steps to Al-Ghazi. In Arabic: \nSANG OFFICER This is unacceptable. \nAl-Ghazi stands still, silent. Fleury reaches into his pocket. Reveals the detonator to Al-Ghazi. Al-Ghazi reaches to take it. Fleury holds it for a BEAT... \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) Let me help you. \nHe hands the detonator to Al-Ghazi.    Al-Ghazi now pockets it. \nA BEAT... \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI We break now: too hot to work outdoors. Then we will leave for the Palace. \nRONALD FLEURY And I imagine that will run until sundown? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (beat) I had televisions delivered to your quarters to pass the downtime. \nFleury just nods back. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) Miss Mayes will not attend this evening. Men only. \nFleury looks over to Janet. Hurt, yet extremely defiant, she looks ready to attack anything that comes near her. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   83. \nFLEURY You want to tell her that? \n83   EXT. CHEVY SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - EARLY EVENING           83 \nCobra gunships covering the convoy as it blurs past police checkpoint after police checkpoint. Intersections shut down. Bracketed front and back by Saudi Humvees. \n84   INT. CHEVY SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - NEXT MOMENT             84 \nAl-Ghazi in the passenger seat, hand on the stock of his Mp- 5: again searching for threats. Our team in back, freshly scrubbed, collared-Polos as formal as anyone thought to pack. Team frustration has evolved into angry acceptance. \nThe convoy zipping alongside a wall now: desert-orange in color, twelve-feet high, blue ottoman tiles running the length of the wall's horizontal center-line. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI We're here. \nThe helicopters peel off at steep angles, the sound of the rotors reverberating in your chest. Leavitt watching them go: \nADAM LEAVITT Big wall. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI It's a big palace. \n85   INT. PRINCE BIN KHALED'S PALACE - DAY                         85 \nMajlis - a Saudi political ceremony in which Saudi citizens and local politicians (most aristocratic and exclusive) are permitted a brief audience with the Prince. A bizarre receiving line of sorts. \nOur team moves through a massive marble hallway towards the ceremony. \nADAM LEAVITT How many Princes are there? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Over 5000. \nRONALD FLEURY They all get palaces this big? \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   84. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Some get bigger. \nADAM LEAVITT Who pays for all this? \nGRANT SYKES General Motors, Ford, Chevrolet... \nADAM LEAVITT Hey, man - I drive a Hybrid. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (a beat...) The Prince will ask you about your flight, the accommodations...lite subjects. If he offers you the chance to hold his Raptors, don't flinch: it's a compliment. \nADAM LEAVITT (to Grant: genuine worry) What's a Raptor? \nDamon Schmidt appears. \n85A   INT. PRINCE BIN KHALED'S PALACE - LATER                      85A \nThe Prince sits on a sea of pillows. There are several small flat screens playing business reports, CNN and Al-Jazeera. \nSeen from behind the Prince: everyone but Leavitt standing next to faces we've never seen. The table holds six gold serving platters. Enough food to kill a famine, tended by a frenzy of servants. \nSykes puts a hand over his cup to stop the constant tea re- fill. \nLeavitt stands to the Prince's left, thick leather glove on his hand, a falcon perched on it. Leavitt holds it away from the rest of his body like he's already made peace with losing the arm. Servants hold three others close-by. \nPRINCE BIN KHALED His talons slice bone. \nADAM LEAVITT Super. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   85. \nPRINCE BIN KHALED That's my most prolific Hunter. I'm trying to teach his friends there by example, but I fear it's something you're born with or not. Do you agree, Mr. Ronald? Innate or not at all? \nRONALD FLEURY I do. \nPRINCE BIN KHALED (nodding: I could tell) What have you seen so far of our Kingdom? -- and know I can arrange tours anywhere within our borders. \nWhen I bull-rush our hosts you'll know it: In his quiet, calm- amidst-the-bullets tone: \nRONALD FLEURY I've seen that the man who planned the worst crime in your Kingdom's history is without a doubt Saudi... \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI From now on, any evidence you find you hand over. \nAl-Ghazi smiles... \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) I'm \"all ears,\" Special Agent Fleury. \nRONALD FLEURY We should start with the dead shooters. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI They had no identification on them. Fingerprints and dental have come up empty. \nRONALD FLEURY Can we photograph all three of them? Couple hundred copies each... \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI No problem. \nRONALD FLEURY Good. If it's OK with you, I'd like to suggest we split up as follows... \nSykes and Leavitt can't help small smiles. Finally getting to work. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   89A. \na89   EXT. BLAST SITE - MORNING                                  a89 \nSykes climbs down into the mud hole. \nGRANT SYKES (from the crater) Fellas, what we want to do is get this water out of here... see what's really going on. Understand? \nNo reaction from Saudi police \nGRANT SYKES (CONT'D) C-VIN hunting--Data Plates-- Something drivable blew up. That's pretty obvious. Feels like ANFO to me, boys--Ammonium Nitrate Fuel Oil. Let's dry this hole and see if we can't figure what she was. Gotta pump? \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   90. \n89   EXT. BLAST SITE - LATER                                      89 \nGrant at the Crater. Three brand-new industrial-sized pumps draining it. 30 Police INVESTIGATORS watch Sykes. \nGRANT SYKES (to the Saudis) Got to get a little dirty, people. Crawl up in it. Make deep contact. You get that? \nDead, confused stares from the Saudis into the mud hole... Sykes happy as a pig in shit. \nGRANT SYKES (CONT'D) Get nasty, dirty, filthy. \nHe smiles, watches another Officer write Saudi translations on the stainless-steel paint cans into which you load evidence: shrapnel, soil, DNA, shells, etc. \n90   EXT. DEATH SQUAD SCENE, AL-RAHMAH - SAME MOMENT              90 \nA JUNIOR OFFICER double-times it to Al-Ghazi with a stack of photos: Rough head-shots of the three dead SHOOTERS. Fleury takes some, hands the rest back to Al-Ghazi. \nRONALD FLEURY Have him pass these out to the compound security. See if anybody knows them. \nFleury, Leavitt, and Al-Ghazi walk past the Land Cruiser Haytham took out. 15 Police INVESTIGATORS on-scene: Leavitt stops, drops his bag. Al-Ghazi introduces him to the Officer in-charge. \nLeavitt opens his evidence kit. A couple of Police can't help but sneak a peek, checking out what the American's got inside. \n91   INT. RIPON HOME - LATER                                      91 \nFleury stands with Al-Ghazi back in the Ripon home. \nRONALD FLEURY Would you mind doing one more thing for me? \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   91. \nEARL No, Sir. \nFleury pulls out the photographs. \nRONALD FLEURY Could you tell me if you recognize any of these men? \nFleury puts the three photographs down on the dining room table: not pretty pictures. Earl and Janine study the photos. \nJANINE ...Horrible. \nA few moments, then: \nEARL I don't know any of them. \nFleury thinks a minute. Looks outside. \nFLEURY I'm just wondering. That chair out side. Looks like it gets a lot of wear. Looks comfortable. \nEARL That my mom's chair. \nFLEURY See, that's exactly what I was thinking. I'm guessing she spends a lot of time sitting outside? \nEARL All day. \nFLEURY She must pretty much see it all. Right? \nEARL She does. \nFLEURY Where is she? \nEARL She's sleeping. \nPause: Fleury slow nods, then... \nAaron Jackson begins shaking his head yes. Tears flow free: sorrow and gratitude. He hangs on to Fleury's hand for a very long time. Silent apologies. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) I will find the man responsible for the death of your wife. We're close. \nAARON JACKSON (beat) Tomorrow it'll be somebody else's wife. \nFleury quiet. \nRONALD FLEURY Then tomorrow I'll come back. \nFleury turns his head: Al-Ghazi approaches on the next lawn down with three JUNIOR OFFICERS. Fleury nods goodbye to Jackson. \nFleury approaches Al-Ghazi, holds up the Shooter's photo. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI The gardener. We know who he is. He's on several watch lists. \nFleury - a slight nod of satisfaction. \nRONALD FLEURY We know where he lives? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI We will very soon. \nRONALD FLEURY You don't seem very excited. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI These are always the easy ones to catch. Rarely does it lead to the planners. (beat) I want to take you somewhere. \nRONALD FLEURY Where? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI To someone who may be able to help us catch Hamza. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   96. \n96   EXT. BLAST SITE - DAY                                        96 \nTen Police Investigators in the crater with Grant. Outside the crater: pieces of vehicles laid out outside: 1/2 of a door, 1/4 of a front axle, bits of engine. Five feet away from that: stacks of bagged evidence, two dozen evidence containers. \nSykes clambers out of the hole, streaks of re-animated mud where sweat streams out of his hairline, mad-dashing for his chin. A chunk of metal in one hand, something small in the other: a marble. He drops it in the appropriate cannister then steps to a chunk of metal: one half of an alternator. \nSykes stares down at the pieces of completely mangled metal. He studies a piece of twisted, half-melted iron. Thinking... \nHe walks over to a second larger piece of twisted metal. Starts trying to fit the two pieces...like a puzzle. \n97   INT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE, PRESENT DAY - NOON                 97 \nThe dead, oblong faces of the dog-walkers. Janet uses forceps to pull a wing-nut from one of the dog-walkers. Places it on a sanitary table littered with shrapnel: tiny bits of colored glass, ball-bearings, parts of razor blades, spent slugs, and scraps of unidentified metal. \n98   EXT. BLAST SITE - CRATER                                     98 \nSykes still works the two large pieces of trashed iron. Until something clicks. The fit. Sykes looks down at the connected metal. \nSYKES It's a gurney. \nSykes looks down at the mud colored DIGGERS. \nSYKES (CONT'D) Who's missing an ambulance? \nJust stares from the Saudis. \nSYKES (CONT'D) Could somebody please go get Sergeant Haytham? \nConfused stares from the Saudis. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   97. \nSYKES (CONT'D) (loud) Sergeant Haytham! \nInside the crater: water-level down to the ankles. Three Saudis dig around what looks to be one of the dualie-style back tires. Re-positioning to get a better grip, Sykes notices the top of what looks to be a sizeable, ragged hole, still mostly submerged. Pointing: \nGRANT SYKES Here. \nSykes slogs over. He drops to his knees, reaches his hand in, all the way to his shoulder, the side of his face to the water: void. Out of the crater, Sykes points to a Bobcat earth-mover, in Arabic: \nGRANT SYKES (CONT'D) Who has the keys? \n99    INT. / EXT. MOBILE FIELD MORGUE - SAME                       99 \nJanet stands with the Saudi Pathologist. She prepares to take a fingerprint from a body. As the moves in to touch the Arab hand, one of the GUARDS unloads in her direction - a full guttural Arabic assault. No idea what he's saying, but it's obvious he's furious. Haytham starts firing back. This is an un-translated argument. We sense that the guard is doing more than expressing his displeasure regarding Janet. This seems to be personal. Janet's getting very nervous. A frightening display. Then, Haytham turns: \nHAYTHAM You cannot touch any Muslims. \nJanet takes a breath as the Police hard-eye her. \nJANET No problem. Can I still touch Americans? \nHAYTHAM Of course. \nJanet moves back to the American dead, as the Saudi Tech continues with the Muslims. She pulls another shard of COLORED GLASS from a wound. \n100   INT./ EXT. SUBURBAN - DOWNTOWN RIYADH                       100 \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   98. \nSERIES OF SHOTS: \nA two car convoy drives deep into the city. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI If America figures out a way of keeping their kids off the computers please let us know. \nRONALD FLEURY Why did he turn himself in? \nBefore Al-Ghazi can answer, Talal begins talking to him in Arabic. Al-Ghazi translates: \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI `You only come after I see there were bombs. (MORE) \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   102. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) Did you know Bin Laden put 5 million-dollars on my head? Why shouldn't it be 10?' \nSubdued laughter. Then Talal becomes quiet, grave. Al-Ghazi continues the translation: \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) The Man who made War on Al-Rahmah is someone my age -- this kind of skill is learned over decades. \nTalal looks at Fleury now, speaking directly to him through Al-Ghazi: \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (CONT'D) A Man who can plan the mass-murder of women and children, then go home at night to his own and sleep soundly...? That kind of Man is supremely difficult to catch. \nRONALD FLEURY (through Al-Ghazi) How does he know he slept soundly? \nColonel Al-Ghazi hesitates, then relays Fleury's question. Talal stares: eyes touched by war-blood-atrocities committed. Someone who believes he's going to Hell. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (translating) Because he hasn't stopped. You stop when their faces don't let you close your eyes... \nRONALD FLEURY (through Al-Ghazi) Is that why you quit? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (translating) 17 days without sleep will make you quit anything. \nTwo TEENAGERS stick their heads into the office. They're mad about the sharing of a computer. Talal puts a fast stop to it. It's obvious he's good with these young boys. He smiles as he speaks to Al-Ghazi. \nAl-Ghazi translates to Fleury. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   103. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) He says he makes my job easier. Here, at least they only fight and kill on computers. \nAl-Ghazi shows Talal the detonator. The old man studies it. Al-Ghazi and Talal speak in Arabic about the detonator. \nAl-Ghazi looks to Fleury, translates. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) He says that there are several ways to get American military equipment like this detonator but not many men in Saudi Arabia that know how to get them. \nFLEURY How do they get them? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Usually smuggled from Iraq by corrupt soldiers working with the Americans. \nFLEURY Could Hamza get this equipment? \nAl-Ghazi asks Talal. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Without question. Yes, he could. \nRONALD FLEURY (through Al-Ghazi) How do we find him? \nHe thinks for a moment, then speaks. The boys chuckle as Al- Ghazi continues translating: \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Prayer. Luck. Handshakes. \nFleury looks at Al-Ghazi, doesn't quite get it... \nRONALD FLEURY (to Al-Ghazi) Well, I think I get the `prayer' and `luck' parts... \nTalal slowly stands, Al-Ghazi helping him up, moves to Fleury. Reaches his hand out to him, quietly: \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   104. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (translating) His hands will feel like this. \nFleury shakes Talal's hand, turns it over: index finger gone. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) (CONT'D) (translating) Every Amir at some point gets bitten by his work. \n106   EXT. BLAST SITE - DAY                                       106 \nThe Bobcat digs   into the crater, over the unknown hole. Already a large   pile of dirt. Another sizeable scoop down about two feet:   nothing. Haytham now stands over the crater watching Sykes.   Leavitt has joined him. \nGRANT SYKES Whatever this is, it blasted-off like NASA. \nHaytham yells to the Machine Operator in Arabic: \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM Driven in at an angle... go deeper... \nAnother gouge of earth: 4 feet. Nothing. Grant sits back. \nGRANT SYKES `High-order explosion' doesn't do it justice: what's left a' this looks like it was put through a wood-chipper. \nLeavitt rubs his eyes: adrenaline long gone. Looks at his watch: time passing fast. Sykes drops to his stomach, reaches in with the TRENCHING TOOL to see how much farther the hole goes: a metallic `clink. \nAn oxygen tank. The kind used in ambulances. Nozzle assembly gone, burst in the explosion with a force that drove it several feet into solid ground. Haytham takes a razor blade, scratches off samples of the soil and carbon for explosive residue into a fresh cannister. Then takes a wet rag, begins cleaning the tank to reveal Arabic script... \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM (to Sykes) Hospital Identification... Ambulance identification. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   105. \nRONALD FLEURY JANET... \nJanet makes her way back. Immediately moves to the wounded SWAT Officer. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) He's gone... This shrapnel look like the stuff you pulled at the morgue? \nJANET MAYES (distracted) Yeah... I pulled so much it's hard to remember it all. \nRONALD FLEURY Bolts? \nJANET MAYES Yes. \nRONALD FLEURY Wing nuts? \nJANET MAYES Yeah. \nRONALD FLEURY Razor blades? \nJANET MAYES Sure. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   109. \nAl-Ghazi begins tossing the room, motions to Fleury: help. Fleury moves to him. \nRONALD FLEURY (calling back) ADAM... \nGRANT SYKES C-4... \nAl-Ghazi dumps desk drawers: pictures of government-looking buildings, walled-compounds. Lays them out in rows, studying each. Leavitt appears, focuses on the C-4 immediately. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (O.C.) -the front gates of every other western housing compound in Riyadh. \nEverybody looks at the Colonel, pointing at the pictures: \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) And Embassies: Italy, Japan, Korea, Norway, England... \nADAM LEAVITT (beat) The Coalition... \nLeavitt steps, scans the pictures, picks up two in particular: buildings with scaffolding and heavy equipment. \nADAM LEAVITT (CONT'D) These are all countries with Troops in Iraq -- Japanese and Italian embassies are under construction? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI The entire Diplomatic Quarter is being retro-fitted to sustain bigger bomb blasts. \nJanet pops her head in: \nJANET MAYES -the Prince's Convoy just showed. \nAl-Ghazi's face: fear. \nRONALD FLEURY This is bullshit. You know it. Meaningless. There's no leader here. These are kids. That's it. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   110. \nAl-Ghazi says nothing. \nJANET MAYES We're out of here. \nRONALD FLEURY Yes, that's it. Smile for the cameras, body-bag some children. Wrap it up, but us -- out. I get it. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI I'm sorry. \n111   EXT. FRONT OF TARGETED HOME - MOMENTS LATER                   111 \nPrince Bin Khaled touring the scene: reporters, photographers, his personal top-line security detail: the business suits and boots, the special ops M-4s. All on edge to be in a Saudi neighborhood. Rahman, looking like he needs sleep and vitamins. Lecturing in Arabic: \nPRINCE BIN KHALED Only in death will our enemies realize Allah never permits defiance of his almighty will. \nDamon Schmidt trailing behind the Prince's detail. The Prince locks Al-Ghazi with a mad-dog stare in-between lesson points. One of the Prince's inner-circle heads straight for Al-Ghazi, in Arabic: \nINNER-CIRCLE Take the Americans inside now and keep them out of sight. You will be spoken to about their presence here. \n112   INT. TARGETED HOUSE - NEXT MOMENT                             112 \nThe Team sitting on the floor, below the window sills, away from the holes and doors. Al-Ghazi standing, looking out the window at the spectacle. Damon Schmidt steps in: sees dead bodies and goes ghost, almost collapses. Leavitt pops up, helps him sit. \nRONALD FLEURY You need water? \nA quick `no' nod: like the second before you lose lunch. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   111. \nADAM LEAVITT You really ought not look at this. \nDAMON SCHMIDT (pointing at the dead) That fella got shot right through his God damn nipple... \nJANET MAYES Don't stare too long. It'll start living in your dreams. \nJanet's voice causes Schmidt to immediately force composure. \nDAMON SCHMIDT No -- I know. \nRONALD FLEURY You do? (beat) How did you know we were here? \nDAMON SCHMIDT The Prince has Men at Al-Rahmah. \nAl-Ghazi gets to the CB radio, in Arabic: \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) Tighten up- \n-the trailing Suburban doesn't `tighten up.' It falls further back. Fleury instinctively turns, wide-eyed -- out the window: a small brown truck swerves out of the opposing lanes, flying across the desert median, aimed at the Convoy. Without hesitation Fleury reaches over Haytham, rips the steering-wheel right, nosing away from the approach... \n114   114 THRU 116 OMITTED                                       114 \n117   EXT. SAUDI HIGHWAY - SAME MOMENT                           117 \nOur Suburban on two wheels: The lead Suburban turns the same direction a twitch too late. The small brown truck detonates. The lead Suburban takes a massive fraction of the explosion broadside, essentially shielding our vehicle. Flame spits through the lead vehicle as it spins, flips onto its roof. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   116. \n118   INT. OUR SUBURBAN - NEXT MOMENT                             118 \nOff-road now, violent impacts on bare rims shedding rubber. \n119   EXT. HIGHWAY ATTACK AFTERMATH - NEXT MOMENT                 119 \nThe lead Suburban: tortoise on its back, engulfed, still sliding. Fleury's Suburban fish-tailing. \nThe Lead Suburban blows in-half now as the gas tank ruptures. A football-sized shard of metal explodes through our windshield- \n120   INT. OUR SUBURBAN - SAME MOMENT                             120 \n- and smashes straight out the back, taking the rear cargo door with it. \nThe shock of it causes Haytham to lose control in earnest now. The Suburban flips, barrel rolls. Violent pounding inside the vehicle. Motion stops: upside down, just the roar of the big Detroit V-8 red-lining, wheels spinning in air. Everyone dazed, border-line unconscious. Fleury's bell rung the worst, trying to function, get his bearings. \nFleury touches Leavitt's face, can barely see through the gathering smoke that smells like oil. \nRONALD FLEURY You whole? \nADAM LEAVITT Think so- \nLeavitt unbuckles his seat belt and smashes head first into the ceiling -- running FOOTFALLS approach, quick yell-yips in Arabic: commands? \nThe Driver and three other Police Officers from the trailing Suburban. Smoke fills the interior now: thank God these Police Officers have ripped open a door: saviors. They grip Leavitt by his hair because it's the only thing they can grab. \nAlarmed, Al-Ghazi begins to scramble for Leavitt. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI This is not right! \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   117. \nHaytham gets a good look at the driver, recognizes him as the officer who shamed him at the compound on day one. Haytham moves to unbuckle. \nFleury's trying to claw towards Leavitt. Throwing upside down punches at the air. Unbuckles himself now. \nRONALD FLEURY WHAT THE- \nJANET MAYES (panicked) ADAM! WHAT -- WHAT ARE THEY DOING? \nAlarm rising, everyone else unbuckles and smashes into the ceiling as horizons go flip-flop confusion. \n121   EXT. HIGHWAY ATTACK AFTERMATH - NEXT MOMENT                 121 \nLeavitt's throwing punches as he's dragged with velocity to the trail Suburban, idling. Pistol-whipped viciously, repeatedly until they're able to kick him inside. Another Officer from the trailing vehicle steps up with an AK-47, pulls back the cocking mechanism, ready to spray the dazed occupants of our Suburban- \n-the Officer's ankles and shins detonate. POP-POP-POP-POP from the driver's seat: Haytham. Screams from the would-be shooter at double volume. Haytham keeps firing as the Officer, hit multiple times, falls hard. \nThe trailing Suburban hesitates,   slams into our Suburban just as Fleury is getting out of the    wreckage. Everybody else still inside, knocked silly. The   trailing Suburban backs up quick. Fleury instinctively goes   for his holster: empty for days now. \nRONALD FLEURY GUN! \nTrailing Suburban accelerates away now, as Janet struggles out. Haytham's 9 MM in-hand racked open: empty. Fleury steps away from the now black smoke pouring from the vehicle -- in the passenger seat of the trail Suburban, he sees the Officer that checked passports at Prince Sultan Air Base. \nGRANT SYKES -DOOR HELP- \nFleury rips Grant's door open. Trapped smoke billows, clears: Grant's arm closest to the outside of the vehicle dangles at an unnatural angle, bleeding badly. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   118. \nGRANT SYKES (CONT'D) Can't release- \nFleury begins sawing Grant's seat-belt with a jagged piece of metal. \nRONALD FLEURY Hands up -- you're gonna fall- \nSykes still does, ugly. Fleury and Janet rip him free of the Suburban. \nHaytham's pulling shotguns, handguns, ammo from the flipped vehicle. Haytham pointing ahead, to the fading roster-tail. In Arabic: \nSERGEANT HAYTHAM They're going to disappear... \nDesperate, Fleury looks in the direction of the fleeing Suburban: the rooster-tail it leaves getting smaller. Al- Ghazi nods, swings his head to thesnarled/wrecked highway traffic. PEOPLE hesitantly step toward uniforms they trust on instinct. Haytham dumps the pile of weapons at the Team's feet, re-loads his 9MM. Janet ties a half-assed tourniquet around Sykes' reminder of an arm. \nAl-Ghazi steps toward the approaching crowd: they see his state, his gun, and turn back: panic starts to infect the larger mass, then the topper- \n-AUTOMATIC GUNFIRE from somewhere. Glass-dirt-metal bursts around us: this attack is still going. \nFleury looks up: just the roof of an old Mercedes on the median, dirt kicked up behind them, running behind lines of stopped-wrecked traffic now. The barrel of a rifle held high out the window like a taunt. Accelerating for another opening to finish the job. \nScared motorists devolve into terrified motorists. Many have abandoned their vehicles to sprint into the desert, the rest go smash-'em-up derby-folly: 50 panicked drivers aiming for the same spots. Fleury snatches an M4A1 from the stack dropped by Haytham, up to his shoulder, hustling toward the next break in traffic. The Mercedes is approaching at 80 MPH. \nA second passes: these people know where the attackers went. Al-Ghazi locks eyes with a little boy... he quickly-quietly just shakes his head no. In the back, Sykes has fallen on his back. He looks up through the window: sees a shape jet past on the top of the closest building -- three stories up: the little boy was nodding a warning- \nWhat follows is fast, chaotic, eyes-closed combat: \nGRANT SYKES -GET OUT OF- \n-big BOOM of close-in shells. As Haytham throws it in reverse and punches, the front of the Rover shreds. The windshield bursts. Engine dies: tachometer and speedometer needles bottom out instantly. Haytham and Al-Ghazi tuck into the dash. Fleury tries to get as close to the backseat floor panels as possible. Janet covers Sykes. \nA Thump-Thump-Thump can be heard on the roof: A GRENADE thrown with too much arm by the guy Sykes spotted bounces off the roof and into the Land Cruiser. \nFrantic, Fleury swats it out. \nThe blast releases a massive airburst and bits of shrapnel into the vehicle, starring windows, rocking it: creak of shocks and struts. Fleury lifts up now, grabs the M-4: returns fire indiscriminately through the windows at any and all surrounding rooftops. That provides cover and reminds everyone in the car they're armed. Janet exits with a rifle: firing out the back door, more covering fire. Civilians who were ready to see a massacre scurry now that it's a fight. \n129   EXT. ROOF TOP - NEXT MOMENT                               129 \nA SHOOTER: black-hood, black T-shirt, old-school red-white- black Air Jordans, snub-stock AK, an open, filthy North Face backpack at his feet holding spare clips, God knows what else. \nShots from below keep him two feet away from the ledge, firing down in random sweeps, head turned like he's lighting a fire-cracker. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   123. \nWe see things from above, three stories down, a sweep of blindly-fired shells pop the asphalt inches from Fleury's head, soiling his face in black-top debris. But Fleury never stops firing back, his own head slightly turned, flinching on reflex. Air Jordan grabs another grenade just before he disintegrates: Fleury's three-feet away with the riot gun. Another rack and blast to make sure A.J. stays down for eternity. \nFleury spots and bull-charges a second SHOOTER: Ballistic Chicken, Fleury wins. A sound... Fleury spins, racking the riot gun, aims and FREEZES: 2 six year old BOYS stare from the doorway. \n130   EXT. SUWEIDI STREET - NEXT MOMENT                           130 \nHaytham crouches in front of the Land Cruiser. Rocks thrown now from somewhere: KIDS peeking from behind shacks Palestinian-style. He's pelted in the side of the head. \nJanet and Sykes move to a stopped vehicle and take cover. \nFrom the rooftop, Fleury yells down to the men on the ground. \nFLEURY (O.C.) I CAN SEE THE MERCEDES... BLOOD- TRAILS RIGHT UP TO AN APARTMENT IN THE NEXT BUILDING- \n131   EXT. ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                                 131 \nFleury's P.O.V.: an Apartment complex that looks like a roadside motel: exposed stairwells, walkways, entrances. A puddle in front of one of the front doors on the third floor. Then we look right, one street over: civilian FIGURES, some in traditional dress, starting to mass. \nFLEURY MOB FORMING NEXT BLOCK! \nHe drops the riot gun, picks up the AK from the man he just killed, pops a new clip from the backpack, slings the backpack over her shoulders. Starts to hustle down. \n132   INT. UNKNOWN ROOM - SAME MOMENT                             132 \nGunshots reverberating from outside. Echoes. The 32 year-old, hands shaking with nerves, screwing the camera into the tri- pod: set-up almost complete. The Passport Officer is posted at the door: head poking out, weapon up and ready. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   124. \nWe can hear Arabic yells down what sounds like a hallway. Passport Officer barks something back. \nThe Driver of the Trail Suburban squats, pinning Leavitt's head down with his knee, knife near a long, white expanse of neck. The Huge Man sits on Leavitt's stomach, keeping him in place. Leavitt trying to gasp for breath: eyes-wide panic. \nDRIVER READY? \nJust as the 32 year-old nods yes, Leavitt explodes with his last bit of effort: kicks just enough to nudge the Camera, trying to knock it over. The 32 year-old gets his hands on it as it falls, almost catches it, slips out, smacks the ground, battery pops off. The Driver and Huge Man both begin hammering Adam. \nPASSPORT OFFICER (O.C.) (in Arabic) GOD DAMN HIM! \n32 year-old picks the camera up again, trying to re-attach the battery as Adam fights for his life. Spit and claws and snot and blood rage. \n133   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - NEXT MOMENT                  133 \nRunning down side stairs, Fleury spots a grenade launcher poking from a door, next-door to the apartment with blood- pool in front. \nRONALD FLEURY RPG! \nEmpties his clip into that vicinity: windows shatter, wood splinters. The grenade launcher recedes. Janet and Al-Ghazi start to run. The launcher fires from its new position...The trail suburban DETONATES. Al-Ghazi and Janet knocked flat on their asses for second and third times: dazed. \nFleury searching: I know that Fuck with the RPG is reloading, how do I kill him. Drops the bag off his shoulders, pulls a grenade out, fires it as hard as he can: 40 yards on the fly. Bounces just on the third floor landing- \n134   INT. ENEMY APARTMENT - SAME MOMENT                          134 \n-RPG Soldier just locking the new rocket tube in, brings the reticle up to his eye. Grenade blast splits through what's left of the front window. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   125. \nBig flinch-tense on his part: rocket fires inside, roars down the hall, hits two feet in-front of the door Passport Officer has been peaking out of. \nMassive, contained detonation.   Passport Officer vanishes. The 32 year-old and his camera are   blown through the Driver waiting to saw Leavitt's neck.   Because Leavitt was held so tight to the floor, he escapes   the worst of the blast. Still fucked up. \nLeavitt's P.O.V.: ears roar with the ring, no sounds. 32 year- old and Driver lay in a heap on the floor. Huge Man's on his back, trying to get up. Leavitt breathes, rolls to the Driver and the boy: grabs driver's blade. Hand to hand war as Leavitt gets his payback. He does not stop. \n135   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK APARTMENTS - SAME MOMENT                  135 \nSykes takes cover between two cars, holding down the rear, firing warning shots and screaming football plays to freak out the LOCALS. \nSYKES THIRTY EIGHT RAZOR MAD DOG!!! \nHe fires above the crowd, as Janet heads into the building. Two LITTLE KIDS slowly approach carrying water, obviously terrified at the sight of the wounded American. \nSirens and helicopters sound in the distance. \n136   EXT./INT.

The teammates of the plump-pink Boy on third: \nTEAMMATES TAG UP! WAIT `TIL SHE CATCHES IT- \nPITCHER (spins, points up at the ball) -COMIN' HOME! \nA 14 year-old Indian girl sprints underneath the fly-ball: sets up, catches it, juggles it, drops it. \nWe pick up different families on the grass nearby: A young WOMAN helps her five year old DAUGHTER untangle a yo-yo.

The whole Family, save the youngest Grandson, intently focused on two Officers walking up to that Police Land Cruiser parked in the middle of the road, well inside the compound: no blinks now. \nThe youngest still enthralled by the softball game, the cheers, the running, the shorts and t-shirts. We see his Grandfather's left hand stop rubbing the Boy's head, and move to the Boy's temple, placed like a blinder so he can't see what's about to happen. In Arabic: \nGRANDFATHER Don't stop watching the game. \n14   EXT. INSIDE THE COMPOUND WALLS - NEXT MOMENT                 14 \nNoises from the softball game close again. Track these two Officers on foot walking toward the Police Land Cruiser ala shift change: nonchalant but quick. \n15   INT. POLICE LAND CRUISER - SAME MOMENT                       15 \nThe Driver eyeing the two approaching Officers: something off about them. Uniforms wrinkled, one with a full beard. Driver turns to his Partner, in Arabic: \nDRIVER You have a copy of the duty rost- \n-POP-POP-POP before the Driver finishes. The Officers on foot rapid-firing 9MM pistols. The Driver and Passenger hit multiple times instantly, crumble lifeless in their seats before anyone has time to process the sounds, link them to an attack. The two firing `Officers' move low-fast like professionals: rip the fresh bodies from the Cruiser, jump in. The new Passenger rips an AR-15 rifle off the center console. The new Driver lays rubber into the Compound. \n16   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                          16 \nThe youngest Grandson wide-eyed, startled, watches as every member of the Security Details in and around the Compound go prairie dog: search with necks extended, eyes wide -- what the fuck was that? The Boy tries to turn his head away from the game to look for himself: Grandfather just pushes his head back to the game, voice harder now, in Arabic: \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   9. \nGRANDFATHER (O.C.)

COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT                  18 \nGame forgotten. Parents up, screaming for loved ones, moving fast toward the parking lot. The Middle-Eastern Officer that has been watching the game hustles onto the field, next to the Pitcher, waves people toward him. Gathering but sporadic gun-fire in very near distance. \nWATCHING OFFICER (accented English) COME TO ME! FOLLOW ME! \nPeople immediately flocking around the authority figure. \nCUT TO: \nThe 14 year-old Indian Girl running in, more puzzled than scared: why is that Cop wearing a jacket in this heat? \nBACK TO: \nThe Officer rips a yellow gun-shape from his jacket pocket. The Pitcher sees it, instinctively tries to rip it away from him. Gets a handful of collar, pulls as violently as he can, shreds the front of the Officer's coat: a white linen vest with a bulge in-front underneath the jacket... \n19   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                           19 \nThe youngest grandson's wide-eyed face. Then we see the Grandfather's right-hand slide down the other side of his youngest Grandson's face, coming to rest on his other temple: making sure he's still watching the Softball diamond now. The Grandfather's right hand: missing an index and middle finger. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   10. \n20   EXT. COMPOUND SOFTBALL DIAMOND - SAME MOMENT                 20 \nPanic. The Officer swings the yellow gun-shape, what we now realize is an electric drill crudely modified into something else, bashes the Pitcher's face with it. Those that had gathered have turned, are sprint-stumbling away... \nThe Officer closes his eyes, depresses the drill trigger, vanishes before we comprehend the massive release of blue- black chaos, expanding in an ever-wider sphere. Immediate surroundings dissolve: players, parents, stands, cars, the light standards surrounding the field and parking lot. \n21   EXT. CINDER-BLOCK CONCESSION STAND - SAME MOMENT             21 \nLocated behind straight-a-way center field, at the nexus of four fields. We see it from profile as shock-wave and shrapnel blast the structure: another Officer hiding behind it staggers out now, sprawls ugly: balance fucked from a blown inner-ear. He also wears a jacket, and holds a modified yellow plastic power drill. Moves uneasy toward screams in the nearby parking lot. \n22   EXT. SOFTBALL DIAMOND PARKING LOT - NEXT MOMENT              22 \nThe off-balance Officer stops over a 30 year-old African- American woman pinned under a Toyota. She hyperventilates, her bare leg and open-toed sandal kick at air. The Officer's breathing calms: the sight of exposed skin as divine reassurance. CLOSE-UP: the vented rear of the drill as the 14.4 volt motor sparks blue. A second blue-black explosion that shreds the parking lot as cars smash into one another desperate to escape. \n23   EXT. ADJACENT STREET - NEXT MOMENT                           23 \nPanicked women walking dogs. Frozen. A Police Land Cruiser with bullet-scarred windows roars around the corner. Stops near the women. They smile: cavalry to the rescue. Then a man with leans out the window with an AR-15: point-blank staccato. Tracers exit bodies, drill asphalt. The Land Cruiser rolls, spraying passing homes indiscriminate... \n24   INT. JACKED LAND CRUISER - NEXT MOMENT                       24 \nTearing through the streets, Passenger firing at all signs of life. Sits back for a lightning-quick re-load.

The Passenger is launched out his window, head-first into the curb. Both vehicles smoke- screech. Momentary pause after the a massive collision. \nThen Sergeant Haytham, 9MM in-hand, falls from the Second Land Cruiser. Stalks bloody to the Passenger side of the jacked Land Cruiser still slowly rolling backwards, leaking all it's vital fluids, it's snapped drive-shaft leaving a groove in the pavement. And Sergeant Haytham empties his clip into the interior while walking along side. \nThe Officer Haytham told to 'move,' rips himself from the Passenger's side of their vehicle, bleeding profusely, screaming something unintelligible into his handheld radio. \n26   EXT. UNKNOWN ROOF TOP - SAME MOMENT                           26 \nJust the youngest Grandson's horrified eyes: he had no choice but to see it all, carnage painted permanently. His face still held tight between his Grandfather's hands. In Arabic: \nGRANDFATHER (O.C.) Our Time is not a peaceful one. God has left it to us to make it so. \nHold on those deep, young, brown eyes. \nThose young brown eyes finally blink. \nCUT TO: \n27   INT. WASHINGTON DC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL- LATER                   27 \nEveryone eats snacks that the Fleurys brought. Kevin's the center of attention. Fleury's passing out juice boxes. \nFleury's cell phone vibrates. TIGHT ON THE ID: 911. Fleury's mid-juice-pass, answering his phone at the same time. \nKevin looks to his Dad, already grimacing. Fleury walks away from the kids. \nRONALD FLEURY (surprised) Fran? \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   12. \nWe hear Fran's voice as though we're on the line with him: raspy-ragged, like he's been crying. \nFRAN (O.S.) You getting this yet? \nRONALD FLEURY Hey, I'm at Kevin's school. What's goin' on? \nFRAN (O.S.) I'm sorry, Brother. (beat) Riyadh. Many Dead. \nFleury's demeanor shifts to HARD immediately. \nRONALD FLEURY Where exactly? \nFRAN (O.S.) The Al-Rahmah Western Housing Compound. Oil Company employees. Hit a company picnic. \nRONALD FLEURY How? \nFRAN (O.S.) Big. Broad daylight. Blew up a softball game. (tears) Kids, Brother. \nFleury looks at the kids eating and laughing. \nKEVIN FLEURY Dad? \nFleury smiles best he can at his Son. Into the phone: \nRONALD FLEURY When? \nFRAN (O.S.) Just went off -- twenty minutes ago. Two bombers. A Shooter crew as diversion...it's just awful. \nRONALD FLEURY Fran, I'm rollin' right now. Let me call you back: I gotta ring bells \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   13. \nFRAN MANNER (O.S.) Go. I'll be here. \nFleury hangs up, walks to Kevin, kneels down - oblivious to everyone watching. \nRONALD FLEURY Son, I gotta go to work. \nKEVIN FLEURY We're gonna do ceramics... \nRONALD FLEURY I gotta go to work... \nKEVIN FLEURY (points to the phone) Who was that? \nRONALD FLEURY Big Fran -- you remember him? \nKEVIN FLEURY (beat, thinking) Uncle Fran? Put peanuts in his Coke so he could drink and eat all at the same time? \nRONALD FLEURY (smile) Where he's from in South Carolina that's called fine-dining, Bud. \nKEVIN FLEURY What happened? \nRONALD FLEURY (beat) Something bad. \nKEVIN (impression of his Dad) `Lotta bad people out there...' \nRONALD FLEURY (smiles, already homesick) I love you. \nKisses his boy's forehead hard. \nKEVIN FLEURY You gonna go see him? \n", "test1_id": 2547, "test2_input": "ADAM LEAVITT Israeli stamp in my passport? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (in Arabic to the Officer) That is not our concern. \nAl-Ghazi takes the passports and badges, hands them back. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) I'm also to collect your sidearms. \nThis is like handing over your first-born. Fleury goes first. Haytham puts each weapon in a padded case. \nGRANT SYKES And I usually just toss it on the kitchen table... \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (small smile) If each of you would please get into the middle vehicle. \n61   INT. MIDDLE SUBURBAN, RIYADH SUBURBS - NIGHT                61 \nThe speedometer at 110 m.p.h. Haytham navigates with his left hand. Prayer beads hang from the rearview mirror. Al-Ghazi in the passenger seat, right hand rubbing another set of prayer beads down to nubs. The team in the back rows: all staring at the prayer beads on the mirror. \nJANET MAYES (whispering to Leavitt) Wouldn't need the power a' prayer if there were 2 hands on the wheel. \nADAM LEAVIIT 110 miles per hour... How do you keep so calm? I mean, really? Is it breathing-- \nJANET MAYES --Shhhh.... \nRONALD FLEURY If somebody was tailing us it'd be obvious. This is just standard operating speed. \nAl-Ghazi on the edge of his seat, no belt, scanning for threats: sidewalks, traffic, rooftops. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06    50. \nHis left hand hand wrapped around the stock of an Mp-5 machine gun. Fleury takes in a deep breath: let's see who this guy is. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) Colonel, have you ever been to the US? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI I have been there only once. I spent four days at Quantico... I saw your Michael Jordan play for the Washington Wizards. \nSmall laughs. \nRONALD FLEURY You don't know what you missed... you should have seen him play for our Chicago Bulls. \nFleury nods to Sykes, giving him the go to start in with the Bad Cop. Throughout the following exchange, we stay TIGHT ON FLEURY: in control, using Sykes to ask the questions he \"diplomatically\" does not want to ask. \nGRANT SYKES You have portable lights on-scene? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (loses his smile) Yes. But your team cannot work nights. \nJanet looks to Leavitt, then Fleury: `what did he say?' Fleury looks to Sykes, `Keep going...' \nGRANT SYKES We only have seven days: we work around the clock. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Five days. And you are not safe at night. \nGRANT SYKES We're safe during the day? \nFleury is about to step in when- \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (in Arabic, shocking) WATCH IT-SLOW! \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   51. \nA truck 200 yards ahead in the middle of an abrupt U-turn. Over the median. Dust cloud. Heading back our way. Something big in the truck's bed. Our vehicle shimmies as Al-Ghazi flinches, drops his prayer beads. Mp-5 up to the Colonel's sight-line, muzzle tracking the truck. Leavitt leans away from his window as the vehicles pass: streetlights show two farmers, a camel sitting in the bed. Missed their left turn. \nA long, nearly comical moment. \nADAM LEAVITT (smartass) I don't like camels. \nFleury cycling through different angles. Continues: \nRONALD FLEURY Colonel, do you believe Abu Hamza was responsible for this attack? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI We don't know. \nRONALD FLEURY Were Saudi Police involved in the attack? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI We don't know that either. \nRONALD FLEURY Any word on what that third big blast was? \nAl-Ghazi getting tired of the questions: exhausted himself. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI Not yet. \nGRANT SYKES You interviewed witnesses? \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (short-fuse burning) We're trying. No one who was close enough to see the things we would like to know, lived. \nGRANT SYKES Were any of the uniformed bombers brother-officers? \nNo answer. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   52. \nGRANT SYKES (CONT'D) Do you know yet? \nNo answer. Team feeling the tension. Fleury steps in and takes charge. \n", "test2_true": "Al-Ghazi stanches an explosion. Haytham looks over at his Colonel: rarely ever seen him like this. Looks in the rear- view mirror to see Sykes, the man giving the Colonel fits. Sykes catches him looking back, gives him a quick wink into the mirror. TIGHT ON Haytham's face: the guilty little smile you give when someone takes your boss to task. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI 47 of my `brother-officers' were blown into hundreds of pieces that will take months to collect. 80,000 Officers total, across the country, at four uniforms apiece. Thousands of people who can sew forgeries. Apologies that I don't have definitive answers.

GIDEON YOUNG'S OFFICE - EVENING RUSH HOUR, EST          63 \nDirector Grace already sits in front of Young's desk. \nDIRECTOR GRACE Good afternoon, Sir. \nYoung says nothing, just pulls a memo from his bag, clears his throat -- still no eye-contact -- reads aloud like a poor man's Orson Welles: \nGIDEON YOUNG `Sunlight is indeed the most powerful disinfectant. (MORE) \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   53. \nGIDEON YOUNG (CONT'D) In that spirit I come before this Judiciary Committee with a painful admission. (beat) Simply: I've lost all confidence in the FBI, especially it's uppermost echelon. Entrenched and outmoded, the Leadership has shown itself fearful of the pioneering thought this Committee and I have tried to imbue. It is thus an Agency at contretemps, hindering our every effort.' And by `Committee' I mean the fucking SENATE SELECT COMMITTEE ON TERROR... \nYoung finally makes eye contact: expecting something like fear, remorse, back-pedalling... \nDIRECTOR GRACE Senators? Then I'd change `outmoded' to `outdated,' `echelons' to `ranks' and what in God's name is `contretemps?' These guys aren't the best and brightest- \nYoung's face flashes red, seething: \nGIDEON YOUNG -never take the Lord's name in vain in this office- \nDIRECTOR GRACE -but you can say `Fucking?' \nYoung apoplectic now: ready to end the Director right there, when Grace leans in, lets the vague threat of physical contact manifest. \nDIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D) You're going to the Senate Select Committee, but not to the President who appointed you. Why's that? (beat) I bet the President wasn't the audience you thought he'd be: I'll bet he realized you can't have Voters asking why the second- longest serving FBI Director gets fired for doing his job, for sending Agents into Saudi Arabia, seven months from mid-term elections- \nKINGDOM 8/18/06    54. \nGIDEON YOUNG -you really want to bet? \nGrace snaps his ID badge off his lapel, puts it on the table. \nDIRECTOR GRACE I do. \nYoung's pallor tells us his bluff has been called. Goes silent. Grace smells it, finishes him now: \nDIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D) Westmoreland made all us Officers write our own obituaries during Tet, when it looked like the Cong were going to end it all right there. Once we clued-in that life was finite, the loss of it no longer scared us: the end comes no matter what, it's just a question of how you want to go out: on your feet or on your knees. After that, we went out and pulled triggers until barrels melted. And Vietnam lasted another seven years. (beat) The lesson extends to this career: I ACT, knowing the end of this job will come, no matter what. You should do the same. \nGrace waits: nothing else from Young. Stands, snaps his ID badge back on his lapel, walks out. \nDIRECTOR GRACE (CONT'D) I'll forward Fleury's reports. \n64   EXT. OUTSIDE AL-RAHMAH HOUSING COMPLEX - NIGHT, SAUDI TIME 64 \nThe convoy brakes impossibly close to a checkpoint. Waved through perimeters staffed by SANG and Police. Fatigues, automatic rifles, peering at the tinted windows. \n65   INT. MIDDLE SUBURBAN - NEXT MOMENT                           65 \nCrew arrives at a crime-scene that spans the immediate horizon. White tents with SANG sitting under each. Industrial lights outline shattered buildings, idle heavy equipment, bombed-out automobiles. TIGHT ON MAYES looking out. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   55. \nJANET MAYES That's one of the great horrors of television: Crime scene manipulation. They say a TV camera adds pounds to actresses. Isn't that what they say? \nADAM LEAVITT Who's \"they?\" \nJANET MAYES That is what they say. Doesn't add to crime scenes. Television cameras shrink them. Misrepresent. No smells. Poor sound. Limited view. TV always makes them look smaller. You can't feel the hatred on television. \nTIGHT ON FLEURY: Quiet and focused, taking everything in. \nFLEURY ...heads on a swivel, people. \n66   EXT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - NEXT MOMENT               66 \nTwo more security perimeters of SANG surround the Community Center: blinding portable lights, heavy machine guns mounted in the backs of Humvees track the convoy as it comes to a stop: every troop on-guard. The Team tentatively exits: 100 pairs of glares from heavily-armed SANG. \nSoldiers descend on the Teams' bags, paletts of equipment. Long leers at Janet: not so much `sexual' as `wary.' Janet goes for her own bag. Haytham goes for it at the same time. Their hands accidently touch. Haytham pulls back fast, embarrassed. \nJANET MAYES EASY. \nJanet notices the nasty marks around Haytham's right ear. \n67   INT. AL-RAHMAH COMMUNITY CENTER - NEXT MOMENT               67 \nFlorescent lights make it ugly. Haytham dumps duffel-bags by their bunks, SANG stack steel travel-boxes from the paletts inside. No windows, AC cranked to `coldest.' Americans sealed- in - in the name of comfort. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   56. \nJanet's area made obvious with a floral partition. She immediately folds it, puts it into a corner. Haytham watches her undo his work. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI The bathrooms are through that door. I will be here tomorrow morning so we can begin. \nFLEURY What time tomorrow morning? \n", "test2_id": 2548, "test3_input": "Little One trembles. One of the women in the corner calls to her in Arabic, sharp. Janet just strokes the back of her little bloody fist. Her little hand opens, shaking: this is a gift for you. \nJanet's face ghost white: Little One is trying to give her a marble... \nAl-Ghazi steps closer, sees the marble. Processes things. Immediately looks over at the huddled mass: THE GRANDFATHER staring right back at him. We now see the old man clearly. Al- Ghazi shaking, slowly steps to him, hands out... \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) (in Arabic) Let me help you up, Old Man... \nThe old man nods a `no.' \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) (in Arabic) GIVE ME YOUR HANDS! \nAl-Ghazi rips Grandfather up now. The family screams. Al- Ghazi pulls the old man's hands from under his thobe: missing fingers. Bends at the knees to look the Old Man right in his eyes, lifts his chin with his hand. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) (dazed, starting to realize) ...Hamza. \nThe old man looks up at Al-Ghazi: rage and defiance. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI (CONT'D) I got you. Abu Hamza, you are under arrest. \nABU HAMZA stares, hatred burning into Al-Ghazi. \nNASSAR You are a traitor to your country... a traitor to your God. \nCOLONEL AL-GHAZI I am no traitor to my God. You are. \nAl-Ghazi's chest explodes before we hear the booms: the 15 year-old Grandson, firing a cheap, nickel-plated 9MM. Everybody drops. The family huddles that much closer to the floor. Al-Ghazi falls back to the floor, pulling Grandfather with him. \nKINGDOM 8/18/06   130. \nFleury's standing stock still, out-of-body now: He can only see a teenager built like a river-reed, like his own Son... not a Murderer who just shot his friend. Quiet-sick: \nRONALD FLEURY ...Don't... \nThe 15 year-old steps to the doorway, pulls the trigger again: the cheap 9MM jams. Janet lifts up with her AK, aims it at the boy's chest. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) ...drop it, Son...please... \n...The teenager wiping his tears: so he can see clear enough to clear his jammed weapon. Half young boy, the other half something much more dangerous...Expert movements from his hands, racking back the slide, thumbing the still smoking shell from the ejector, letting the slide go, racking another round into the chamber. \nThen... Fleury finally pulls his trigger. \nUtter Distortion as the old man reaches for the teenager's fallen hand gun. Janet, screaming, raises her gun towards the old man as Al-Ghazi shoots the old man in the chest. Sobbing, the little boy runs to his fallen grandfather. Janet, still screaming, covers the family. The Grandfather whispers something we cannot hear in the Little Boy's ear. \nTIGHT ON HAYTHAM taking it all in: the bleeding, dying teenager; his hysterical sister; Hamza choking, clutching for his grandson. CHAOS, CONFUSION, CONFLICT swirling in Haytham's eyes. \nA platoon of SAUDI POLICE slowly enter the room. \nJanet goes to the shot 15 year old, starts trying to stop the bleeding... \nFleury reaching for the dying Al-Ghazi, cradling him. Tears spill as his eyes move from the dying boy to the old man, back down to Al-Ghazi. \nFleury grasps Al-Ghazi's hand, as a Saudi man would. \nRONALD FLEURY (CONT'D) You got him. You got him...

The team's first smiles -- collective. Fleury stares at Haytham...thinks about what he's seen the past few days...how he has come to admire this Kid. Haytham smiling, bandaged himself. Halting and awkward, he shakes Janet's hand. \nHAYTHAM (in Arabic) Thank you. \nJANET MAYES Thank you, Lieutenant Haytham. \nHaytham says good bye to Leavitt and Sykes. Comes to Fleury.

INT.   EMPTY CLASSROOM--DAY 
J.D. moves to an empty row of desks. He turns the first desk as to face the second. HEATHER DUKE warily lowers herself into the second desk as J.D. flops a manilla envelope onto it. HEATHER DUKE opens the envelope and pulls out a stack of 8 by 10's. She gasps. 
The first shot shows a YOUNG HEATHER DUKE in a summer camp uniform that vibrantly reads HEATHER, She is holding one end of a large poster board drawing of two Eskimos rubbing noses. Holding the other end, in a summer camp uniform vibrantly reading MARTHA, is a YOUNG MARTHA DUNNSTOCK/DUMPTRUCK. 
HEATHER DUKE What the..... 
With a harsh laugh, she takes in the next photograph. It has YOUNG HEATHER DUKE and YOUNG MARTHA eating toasted marshmallows off each other's sticks. 
HEATHER DUKE (trying to stay clam) Where did you get these? 
J.D. Oh, I just had the nicest chat with Ms. Dumptruck. Got along famously! It's scary how everyone's got a story to tell....Would you care to see the canoeing shots? 
HEATHER DUKE What do you want from me? 
J.D. Strength. Westerburg doesn't need mushy togetherness, it needs a leader. Heather Chandler was that leader but... 
HEATHER DUKE But she couldn't handle it. 
J.D. laughs. She's on the ball. 
J.D. I think you can. In Catcher in the Rye Holden says his ideal job'd be making sure some kids don't fall off a cliff. He doesn't realize if you pay too much attention to the kids, you'll back off the cliff yourself. 
HEATHER DUKE Very very. The photographs? 
J.D. Don't worry. I'll ask you to do me a favor. You'll get the negatives and everything back then. 
J.D. launches away from his desk with a grin. He places a red ribbon on HEATHER DUKE's desk. 
J.D. In the meantime, strength, And hey, there's a little gift. 
INT.   THE GIRLS BATHROOM 
A spooked HEATHER DUKE splashes water on her face and looks up into the mirror. In a trance, she pulls her hair back Heather Chandler fashion and ties it with the ribbon J.D. gave her. 
A BETTY FINN-A-LIKE moves up to the sink beside her. Two CHIC BABES enter the bathroom with pouting expressions. Seemingly in a trance, HEATHER DUKE bends over and wipes off her wet hands using the oblivious BETTY FINN-A-LIKE's dress. HEATHER DUKE winks to the now-giggling CHIC BABES and saunters off. 
HALLWAY 
HEATHER DUKE bursts through the bathroom door to wickedly strut down the hall. She scowls/smiles in perfect Heather Chandler fashion to various passers-by. 
EARL FRAZIER'S LOCKER 
VERONICA genially lobbys the big black EARL FRAZIER. 
EARL Let me get it clear, Veronica. You want yourself a sweet homeboy for this T.V. show so you can show everybody what a loose, Martin Luther Cosby-lovng place Westerburg is. 
VERONICA (chuckling) Something like that. Will you do it? 
EARL Damn, you're a shrewd one. Shrewd. 
VERONICA I just want to show different kinds of people can get together and it doesn't have to be Vietnam. You don't get treated badly here do you? 
EARL I don't get treated at all, but hey, don't worry about it. I'll do your thing. It'll give my Mom a smile. 
VERONICA hands him a Guest Pass tag. 
VERONICA Things are going to change, Earl. 
EARL Uh-huh. 
HEATHER DUKE impishly blinds VERONICA with her hands. 
HEATHER DUKE Guess who? 
VERONICA Heather. 
HEATHER DUKE lets go with a small giggle. VERONICA turns to face her Heather Chandler-looking friend and her smile dies. VERONICA violently pushes HEATHER DUKE away and storms off. 
INT.   VERONICA'S BEDROOM--NIGHT 
Lying on the floor, VERONICA concentrates on her phone. With a deep sigh, she pushbuttons out a number. She pauses, then... 
VERONICA Ouch. Your machine's got the most obnoxious beep. Heather, I'm sorry. 
INT.   HEATHER DUKE'S BEDROOM 
VERONICA's voice drones through HEATHER DUKE's answering machine. 
VERONICA (O.S./machine) I'm just calling to say you can wear your hair any way you want to.

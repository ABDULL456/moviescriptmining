{"test1_input": "EXT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT \nEstablishing shot. A sports bar that's part of a Holiday Inn. \nINT. SCOREBOARDS -- CONTINUOUS \nJoel sits at the bar. DEAN, the owner of the bar, late forties, and an old friend of Joel's, sits behind the bar on a stool. \nJOEL I gotta get a house with a bathroom that's doesn't share a wall with the TV. \nDEAN Why don't you do that in another bathroom. You've got three of 'em. \nJOEL It would look suspicious. We never use those other bathrooms... Maybe if I had some insulation put in... \nDEAN Insulation?... All I know is, you shouldn't move man; you've got a nice house. I mean you've got the American dream really -- you own your own company. I can't believe you used to bar back for me here, and now you've got all that. \nJOEL But what do I have really? It's a big pain in the ass. \n(MORE) \nJOEL (CONT'D) I'm always working; can't stop or the whole place will fall apart. And what good does it do me anyway? I don't get laid. That stock guy with the shitty band that works for me probably gets laid more than I do. \nDEAN (trying to help) Yeah, but he probably lives in a crappy apartment. \nJOEL Hell, I'd move into a crappy apartment if the bathroom wasn't right next to the TV. \nINT. MUSIC STORE - DAY \nCINDY, a girl in her early twenties, is at the counter looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one of the really nice ones. The price tag says $3,950. She's beautiful and sexy and all that, but there's something vulnerable and sweet about her as well. Two SALESMEN, typical music store employees -- long-haired, goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much attention. It's clear that they don't usually have women this hot in their store. They practically stumble over each other trying to help her. \nSALESMAN #1 Yeah, it's expensive but it's sweet... Are you familiar with the Gibson humbucking pickups? \nCINDY No, sorry. I don't play. It's for my Dad actually -- for his fiftieth birthday. My sisters and I are all pitching in. \nSALESMAN #2 Ah, that's nice... Your Dad would love these humbuckings. They really kick ass. An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has been waiting behind Cindy, trying to get some help, but he might as well be invisible. He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side. \nMALE CUSTOMER Excuse me... I just have a quick question... Salesman #2 is oblivious, never takes his eyes off Cindy. \nSALESMAN #2 \n(OBLIVIOUS) So, what kind of music did he play? Both Salesmen's eyes are glued to Cindy as Male Customer finally gets sick of waiting and storms off into the keyboard room. \nCINDY I think he played like, jazz or something. I'm not sure. \nSALESMAN #2 Well this is an excellent jazz guitar. It's what Pat Metheny plays. \nSALESMAN #1 Is your Dad into Metheny at all? \nCINDY Oh, I don't know who that is. Sorry. \nSALESMAN #2 He's like, a totally kickass fusion guitarist. Are you into fusion? \nCINDY I don't really know much about it... \nSALESMAN #2 I play fusion guitar so... Just curious. \nCINDY Um, do they come in any other colors? \nSALESMAN #1 You mean different finishes? There's a sunburst finish we might have in stock. \n", "test1_true": "SALESMAN #1 Or I could go. Whatever. \nCINDY Are you sure? \nSALESMAN #1/SALESMAN #2 Oh totally./ No prob!/ I'll show you the case it comes with too. The salesmen practically trip over each other, going into the back to find the other guitar. Cindy stands there alone for a beat. She looks around. Then casually picks up the four-thousand dollar guitar and walks out the front door with it. \nEXT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nCindy walks a few yards over to her car, a ' 92 Tercel, puts the guitar in the trunk, gets in and takes off. \nINT. MUSIC STORE - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nThe two Salesmen return -- one carrying the sunburst-finish guitar and the other with the hard-shell case. They look around, notice she's gone. They stand there for a beat, disappointed, before they realize what just happened. \nSALESMAN #1 Oh shit!... \n(FRANTICALLY LOOKING \nAROUND) \nTHE GIBSON! They run out the front door, but Cindy is long gone. \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY \nJoel is at his desk. Brian comes in, excited. \nBRIAN You're not gonna believe this. Remember the guy from General Mills that called a while back? Talking like he wanted to buy us out? \nJOEL I thought you said he wasn't serious; he was just sniffing around. \nBRIAN Yeah, well he's serious now. He just made an offer -- I mean a real offer this time. \nJOEL You're kidding. \nBRIAN No. It must be part of some bigger strategic move, because it's over market value I think. \nJOEL Wow... Joel lets it sink in. He walks over to the window, looking down on the production floor. \nJOEL I could unload all this... I could probably retire... \nBRIAN I mean, yeah, there's a lot of details to work out, but this could be great. They'll be calling back next week, what should I tell them? Joel looks down, sees Mary sitting with her arms folded, shaking her head. \nJOEL Tell 'em hell yes. \nINT. MANUFACTURING FLOOR - CONTINUOUS \nMary sits with her arms folded, refusing to hold the line. \nMARY I already warned him. This is the last time. I'm just gonna sit here. In SLOW MOTION, we see: \n- The first box falls off the end of the assembly line, bottles shatter. - Rory, carrying some boxes slips on the broken bottles of goopey extract, falls and slides into an aisle. - A forklift stops suddenly to avoid hitting Rory, causing a huge stack of pallets to fall off. - Quick shot of Mary shaking her head in slow-motion. - Just as Step rounds a corner to see what's going on, the pallets land on a bunch of pipes and high-pressure valves which burst open sending a piece of shrapnel flying across the room heading straight for - STEP'S CROTCH. The shrapnel heads straight for his genitalia, as we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY \nStep is on a stretcher being loaded into a MEDIVAC helicopter by a couple of EMS guys. Step moans in pain as Joel tries to comfort him. A small crowd of employees watch. ANGLE ON Mary in the crowd, shaking her head. \n", "test1_id": 123, "test2_input": "JOEL Yes. \nDEAN Wow. Man, that really goes to show you -- this town is smaller than you think. You really gotta be careful. Joel hangs up and walks out of his office, past his Secretary. \nJOEL I'm not feeling well. I'm going to go home early. \nINT. JOEL'S CAR -- DAY \nJoel turns the corner to his house and does a double-take as he sees BRAD'S TRUCK going the opposite direction. \nJOEL Shit! Joel slams on the brakes, turns around, chases Brad's truck down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop. They both get out of their vehicles. Joel is livid. \nJOEL What the hell were you doing on my street again?! \nBRAD Dude, you weren't supposed to be home for another four hours-- Whoa, what happened to your face? \nJOEL (trying to improvise a tough, snappy comeback, but can't quite make it \nWORK) \n(MORE) \nJOEL (CONT'D) The same thing that's gonna happen.. Your face is gonna look worse if... GOD DAMMIT! If I ever catch you anywhere near my house or my wife again, I'll have you arrested. \nBRAD For what? Suzie let me in. Joel is stumped -- Brad actually has a point. \nJOEL What the hell is wrong with you anyway? Do you do this with all your clients -- just keep coming back and hanging around? \nBRAD I don't know. This is my first one. \nJOEL What?! I thought you were a professional! \nBRAD Look man, I know she's your wife an' shit, but you might as well know -- I think we're in love. \nJOEL In love?! \n(COMING UNGLUED) HA! Man are you stupid. You are so goddamn dumb. You think she loves you? You're nothing but a piece of ass to her. That's all. \nBRAD I don't think so dude. \nJOEL Oh, you don't think so \"dude?\" Well did you ever think about this: she doesn't even know that I paid you to have sex with her -- did that cross your small mind? \nBRAD Uuh.. \nJOEL How about I go home right now and tell her? Tell her you did it for the money. How about that loverboy? Brad suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out. \nBRAD You wouldn't do that. \nJOEL You don't think so? Watch me. \nBRAD (realizing he's serious) No... Dude, please don't. Please? Joel starts back to his car. \nBRAD Look man, we really have a special thing going on. Please don't mess it up... Joel stops. \nJOEL Don't mess it up?! You're talking about my wife! My house! Stupid- ass! Joel gets in his car and starts it. \nBRAD (calls out to him) Dude, you can't do this to me. \nJOEL Oh yes I can... Joel peels out, drives half a block and turns into his driveway. \n", "test2_true": "Joel walks in, still pissed off. Suzie is sitting on the couch, a little surprised to see him. \nSUZIE Oh hi. You're home early. \nJOEL \n(COLD) Hi. Joel walks over to the sliding glass door, looks outside at the pool. It's filthy. \nJOEL So how was that new pool cleaner? Suzie is caught off guard -- wonders if she's busted -- but she plays it cool. \nSUZIE Um... What do you mean? \nJOEL What do you think I mean?... Did he do a good job cleaning the pool? \nSUZIE Ah... well-- \nJOEL Did he get all the... leaves? It doesn't really look that clean. I mean I'm looking at it, and I'd say it's pretty goddamn filthy. Did the guy even clean it at all? It sure doesn't look like it. \nSUZIE \n(NERVOUS) Well yeah, I guess he didn't do a very good job. \nJOEL I think he did a horrible job. I don't think we should use him anymore. \nSUZIE Okay. \nJOEL Okay. Suzie watches Joel leave, a slight look of guilt on her face. \nSUZIE Are you all right, Joel? You want an aspirin or anything? \nJOEL No. \nINT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nQuick shot of Joel staring up at the ceiling shaking his head, can't believe all this. \nEXT. STEP'S HOUSE -- NEXT DAY \nIn a WIDE SHOT we see Joel's car is parked on the street. He walks up and rings the doorbell. We see Step answer, talk to him and then invite him in. \nINT. STEP'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS \nStep and Joel enter. Step's 300 POUND HALF-BROTHER sits on a ratty couch watching TV, drinking a huge plastic bottle of Pepsi. He looks like he's been sitting there for years. The TV is deafeningly loud. \nSTEP Wow, I don't think you've ever been to my house before. Have you? \nJOEL (talking above the TV) Yeah, I don't think so. I would've remembered... \nSTEP This is my half brother Phil. Joel starts to motion \"don't get up,\" then realizes that's not happening anyway. Phil nods. \nJOEL Hi... Hey Step, can we talk in another room. \nSTEP Sure, let's go out back. \nEXT. STEP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- A LITTLE LATER \nJoel and Step sit at a picnic table. \n", "test2_id": 124, "test3_input": "BRAD Oh, one more thing... I quit my landscaping job... And I don't think I'm really cut out to be a gigolo. So I was wondering if you had any openings over there at your extract place? \nJOEL \n(EXASPERATED SIGH) Brad, you had sex with my wife. I'm not gonna give you a job, okay? \nBRAD Okay... Sorry man. Brad walks away. Joel stares at his beer for a beat, thinking. He calls out to Brad. \nJOEL Hey Brad?... Brad stops. \nBRAD Yeah? \nJOEL I don't know... Maybe come by the office tomorrow. Fill out an application. I'll see what I can do. \nBRAD Cool. Thanks man. \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY \nBrian sits with Joel. They both look pretty miserable. Brian looks down at some papers, shaking his head. \nBRIAN We're screwed. General Mills has pretty much withdrawn the offer pending a really favorable settlement with Step. (shaking his head) Not only do we not sell the company, we could wind up bankrupt. \nJOEL (muttering to himself) So I don't sell the company, don't get the money, I'm bankrupt, I don't get Cindy, I paid a guy to have sex with my wife, and she actually did it... \nBRIAN Excuse me? \nJOEL Nothing. \nEXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY \nSuzie is trying to clean the pool herself, struggling with the long pole with the net at the end. She looks miserable. \nNATHAN (O.S.) Hello? Nathan enters through the back gate. \nSUZIE \n(MUTTERS) Shit... Nathan walks over to Suzie. She's in no mood for this. She acts as unfriendly as possible. \nNATHAN Why are you cleaning the pool yourself? That new guy didn't work out? \nSUZIE Yeah, didn't work out. \nNATHAN Boy, you just can't get good help, eh? \nSUZIE Yeah. \nNATHAN So, did you get a chance to write that check? \nSUZIE Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't going to that dinner okay? Nathan acts deeply disappointed. \nNATHAN Well gee, I wish you would've told me that before I went and bought the tickets. \nSUZIE Joel never agreed to this Nathan, and neither did I. \nNATHAN Well, it sure sounded like you guys were going. Leslie was gonna talk to you about it, but you didn't return our calls. I mean, I already bought these tickets. They're nonrefundable. I really wish you guys had been a little more clear with me... It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes all her pent-up aggression on Nathan. \nSUZIE Okay, let me be really clear with you then. When we say \"I don't think so,\" or even \"I'm not sure,\" that means \"no.\" Why can't you understand that? \nNATHAN Well, I just-- \n", "test3_true": "SUZIE Is that clear enough for you Nathan?! Is that...? Nathan starts to go into some kind of seizure. \nSUZIE \n(WORRIED) Nathan? Nathan's eyes roll back into his head, and he collapses. Suzie SCREAMS. \nEXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- NIGHT \nJoel pulls into the parking lot. He looks surprised, seeing something on the other side of the lot that gets his attention. \nJOEL \n(TO HIMSELF) No way... From JOEL'S POV, we see Cindy pull up and get out of her car. Joel watches as she gets out with a grocery bag and heads up the stairs. Joel gets out and watches her from a distance. He sees her go into a room and shut the door. He stares up at the door for a beat. Then, with a look of determination, Joel walks up the stairs and knocks on her door. \nINT. CINDY'S ROOM -- CONTINUOUS ACTION \nCindy opens the door, a little startled to see Joel, but pleasant to him. \nCINDY Oh... Joel. I ah,... \nJOEL Hi. \nCINDY What're you...? What's up? How'd you know I was here? \nJOEL Ah, actually, I'm staying here too. Down on the first floor, around the back. I thought I saw you so I ah... \nCINDY Well, come in. Joel enters, stands in the living room. Cindy heads in to the kitchen. \nCINDY (O.S.) Do you want something to drink? I think all I have is Diet Coke. Joel notices MARY'S PURSE lying on the coffee table. He stares at it. \nJOEL No thanks. Cindy comes back in with a Diet Coke. \nCINDY Have a seat. Joel remains standing, looking at the purse. \nJOEL That's Mary's purse... Isn't it? \nCINDY What? \nJOEL Right there. That's Mary's purse. \nCINDY Oh that? No, that's mine... So how are things at work? \nJOEL That's Mary's purse. You stole it, didn't you? \nCindy acts like he's being silly. There's nothing about her demeanor that would make anybody think she's lying. \nCINDY No. It probably just looks like it. There's a lot of those. \nJOEL I've never seen another one. You probably have Sylvia's wallet in here somewhere too, don't you? And everything else that's been stolen from my employees. \nCINDY Joel, are you okay? \nJOEL No, I'm not. That's Mary's purse Goddammit! Okay? Everyone blamed Hector. He almost got fired. Doesn't that bother you? \nCINDY (innocent, sweet) Joel, I don't know what you're-- \nJOEL Hector! Hard working guy, never did anything wrong. And what are you doing with Step? You're trying to screw him out of his settlement money aren't you? \n", "test3_id": 125}

{"train": "EXTRACT \nWritten by \nMike Judge \nMarch 2008 \nBEGIN CREDITS: \nEXT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY \nAn idyllic American factory. There's a huge, long lawn in front. A Reynolds Extract sign in brick with flowers/landscaping around it, sits near the entrance. We see from the number of cars in the parking lot that it's a company of about 50 - 75 employees. \nINT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - DAY \nWe are in a manufacturing area of an assembly-line production. It's a big room full of intricate machines, huge vats of different colored extract and other food flavoring products, conveyor belts, bottling machines, etc. It has a high ceiling with offices on the second floor that have big windows overlooking this manufacturing area. We PAN up to the main office. \nINSIDE THE OFFICE JOEL REYNOLDS, head of the company, mid-thirties, is on the phone with his friend DEAN. DEAN (v.o.) You should come by tonight. Half price well drinks while the game's going. \nJOEL You always give me free drinks though. DEAN (v.o.) Oh yeah. Well come by anyway. \nJOEL Yeah?... Might as well. No action going on at my house, that's for sure. DEAN (v.o.) Really? The wife out of town? \nJOEL No... I just haven't been laid in a month. \nDEAN (v.o.) You guys having problems or something? \nJOEL No. This is pretty much normal these days... As CREDITS continue, camera PULLS OUT, back down to the manufacturing area, past a big vat of orange extract, down through various stages of assembly line production, then follows several bottles of orange extract moving past HECTOR, a Mexican immigrant employee in his thirties. The camera stops on him. Talking to Hector is STEP, a short, beady-eyed Charles-Manson-looking guy with a beard and mustache. Step is in his forties. He makes everything he says sound as macho and important as possible. \nSTEP You get this job through Manpower? \nHECTOR Yeah. \nSTEP I started here with Manpower too. Started out on the line just like you. \n(DEAD-SERIOUS) Only I did better... 40 crates a day. Beat. Hector is not quite sure what he's talking about. STEP continues telling his tale in such a way that the only polite reaction would be one of total amazement. \nSTEP (CONT'D) I'm the best sorter in here. That's why they made me full time with benefits. I'll probably be floor manager this year. A FEW FEET AWAY we see RORY, a stocky indie-rock geek, with too many tatoos, hair shaved on the side with a ponytail, lots of bad piercings, wearing baggy shorts with lots of pockets and some kind of gothy T-shirt -- a look that ought to be out of style by now. \nRory is putting stickers on boxes with a sticker gun. He flips the sticker gun around unnecessarily between each application, adding a few unnecessary moves/motions, slapping each box when he's done, generally making the activity look like more of a skill than it actually is. He approaches Step and Hector, pulling out some fliers from his many pockets. \nRORY (hands them each a flier) My band's playing this Friday, come check us out. Hector looks down at the flier. It's xeroxed with fifties clip-art, cut out letters and the name of the band, \"God's Cock\". Hector just looks at it confused, not knowing much English, not sure what he's supposed to be doing with the flier. AT THE END OF THE LINE, where boxes are loaded onto pallets, sits MARY, 58 years old, wearing a 15-year-old pair of acid- wash jeans, and an oversized tweety-bird T-shirt, fanny pack, and dayglow yellow triangle-shaped earrings. She's pear- shaped with short hair. She's bitter and bossy, always shaking her head at everyone. She sits on a stool with a clipboard, looks over her glasses at Hector, shaking her head. She talks to Gabriella, a Hispanic woman in her forties. \nMARY You see that... That new guy. He's holding us up. It's not my job to tell them to hold the line either. \nGABRIELLA And then Joel's gonna come yell at us, cuz he's not doing his job. \nMARY (folds her arms, fed up) I'm just gonna sit here. \nGABRIELLA You're not gonna shut it off? \nMARY I'm not gonna hold the line. If they're not gonna do their job, why should I do mine. Mary sits there, arms folded, lips pursed, refusing to pause the conveyor belt. \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nJoel is still on the phone with Dean. \nJOEL If I don't get home before about 8:00, she puts on the sweatpants and once the sweatpants are on, it's over -- I get nothing. (notices something down \nJOEL \n(TO HIMSELF) Shit! Joel pulls into his driveway as Nathan flags him down. Joel begrudgingly rolls down the passenger side window so Nathan can talk to him. \nNATHAN Hi there Joel! Glad I caught ya... Nathan settles in like he's going to be there a while, leaning with his arms folded, hanging inside the car, trapping Joel. \nNATHAN How've ya been? I left you a message last week. I don't know if you got it or not. \nJOEL Yeah, actually Nathan, I'm kind of in a hurry here. \nNATHAN Oh yeah? You been busy? \nJOEL Yeah, in fact... (checks his watch) I should go right now actually. I gotta call the office before they leave. \nNATHAN Well, real quick while I got ya here -- what're you guys doing November 17th? \nJOEL Ah, I don't ah... (realizes his should fake \nIT) Actually we're going to be out of town that weekend. \nNATHAN Oh yeah? Where you going? \nJOEL Ah... \nNATHAN Oh, wait a minute -- I'm sorry, I meant the 7th. Yeah, November 7th. You'll be in town then right? \nJOEL \n(DEFEATED) Ah...Yeah. \nNATHAN Great. There's this dinner Leslie and I are going to. It's an annual thing -- we do it every year with the Rotary Club -- it's for charity. It's just a whole lot of fun, and we wanted to invite you and Suzie to be our guests at our table. It's-- \nJOEL I'm sorry, I ah... I just don't think that's something we're gonna want to do. \nNATHAN Really? Why not? It's a lot of fun. \nJOEL Oh, I don't know. Suzie doesn't really like going to stuff like \nTHAT-- \nNATHAN Why not? \nJOEL Well, we wouldn't know anybody there. She get's kind of uncomfortable. \nNATHAN Oh no -- It's not like that. She won't be uncomfortable. I guarantee it. No, it's not like that at all. It's not formal or anything. Trust me. It's just a real loose bunch. \nJOEL I just don't... \nNATHAN I tell you what. Why don't we do this -- I'll go ahead and get tickets, since they're gonna sell out fast. You talk to Suzie. See what she says. Like I say, she won't be uncomfortable at all. Maybe I'll have Leslie give her a call -- you know how it is when the wives talk, heh heh-- Joel is about to snap. \nJOEL Um, why don't we talk about this later. (looks at his watch) I gotta make this call before they leave. Joel pulls away, forcing Nathan to raise off the window sill. \nJOEL (CONT'D) \n(CALLING BACK) Sorry... I just gotta make this call! \nINT. JOEL'S GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nJoel pulls the car in, steps out and is shocked to see Nathan right there in his garage. \nEXT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT \nEstablishing shot. A sports bar that's part of a Holiday Inn. \nINT. SCOREBOARDS -- CONTINUOUS \nJoel sits at the bar. DEAN, the owner of the bar, late forties, and an old friend of Joel's, sits behind the bar on a stool. \nJOEL I gotta get a house with a bathroom that's doesn't share a wall with the TV. \nDEAN Why don't you do that in another bathroom. You've got three of 'em. \nJOEL It would look suspicious. We never use those other bathrooms... Maybe if I had some insulation put in... \nDEAN Insulation?... All I know is, you shouldn't move man; you've got a nice house. I mean you've got the American dream really -- you own your own company. I can't believe you used to bar back for me here, and now you've got all that. \nJOEL But what do I have really? It's a big pain in the ass. \n(MORE) \nJOEL (CONT'D) I'm always working; can't stop or the whole place will fall apart. And what good does it do me anyway? I don't get laid. That stock guy with the shitty band that works for me probably gets laid more than I do. \nDEAN (trying to help) Yeah, but he probably lives in a crappy apartment. \nJOEL Hell, I'd move into a crappy apartment if the bathroom wasn't right next to the TV. \nINT. MUSIC STORE - DAY \nCINDY, a girl in her early twenties, is at the counter looking at a new Gibson hollow-body electric guitar -- one of the really nice ones. The price tag says $3,950. She's beautiful and sexy and all that, but there's something vulnerable and sweet about her as well. Two SALESMEN, typical music store employees -- long-haired, goateed, nerdy cocky guitar-hacks are giving her way too much attention. It's clear that they don't usually have women this hot in their store. They practically stumble over each other trying to help her. \nSALESMAN #1 Yeah, it's expensive but it's sweet... Are you familiar with the Gibson humbucking pickups? \nCINDY No, sorry. I don't play. It's for my Dad actually -- for his fiftieth birthday. My sisters and I are all pitching in. \nSALESMAN #2 Ah, that's nice... Your Dad would love these humbuckings. They really kick ass. An annoyed MALE CUSTOMER has been waiting behind Cindy, trying to get some help, but he might as well be invisible. He tries to address Salesman #2, off to the side. \nMALE CUSTOMER Excuse me... I just have a quick question... Salesman #2 is oblivious, never takes his eyes off Cindy. \nSALESMAN #2 \n(OBLIVIOUS) So, what kind of music did he play? Both Salesmen's eyes are glued to Cindy as Male Customer finally gets sick of waiting and storms off into the keyboard room. \nCINDY I think he played like, jazz or something. I'm not sure. \nSALESMAN #2 Well this is an excellent jazz guitar. It's what Pat Metheny plays. \nSALESMAN #1 Is your Dad into Metheny at all? \nCINDY Oh, I don't know who that is. Sorry. \nSALESMAN #2 He's like, a totally kickass fusion guitarist. Are you into fusion? \nCINDY I don't really know much about it... \nSALESMAN #2 I play fusion guitar so... Just curious. \nCINDY Um, do they come in any other colors? \nSALESMAN #1 You mean different finishes? There's a sunburst finish we might have in stock. \nMARY I knew it. That's what happens when you don't pay attention. \nINT. SCOREBOARDS -- LATER \nJoel sits at the bar, on a cell phone. Dean sits behind the bar on a stool. \nJOEL (to the person on the \nPHONE) Uh-huh... Alright. Let me know if you hear anything else. He hangs up, talks to Dean. \nJOEL (CONT'D) Well, he's definitely lost one of 'em. They think they might be able to re-attach the other one, but they're not sure. \nDEAN (shaking his head) Wow... \nJOEL Yeah... I'm not sure how it happened, but we have a great safety record and we comply with all the safety codes so... it was just a freak accident. There'll be an investigation of some kind I'm sure. \nDEAN Well, you have insurance for that kind of thing, right? \nJOEL Oh yeah. Of course. In fact, he'll probably get a huge settlement. \nDEAN Yeah. I would think so. I mean, it's your balls... Beat, as they contemplate the profundity of it. \nJOEL Boy it really makes you stop and think about how fragile we are -- especially our balls. They're just hanging there in a little sack between our legs. At any moment they could be cut off forever. \nDEAN Yeah. And your balls are really important man. Your balls are everything. What kind of life would you have with no testicles? Can you imagine that shit? \nJOEL Yeah... Beat. \nJOEL (CONT'D) You know Dean, my life wouldn't be much different than it is now actually. \n(MORE) \nJOEL (CONT'D) Except for once every three months when I have sex with my wife. In fact, I might even be better off... \nDEAN Wait. Three months? I thought you said it was once a month. \nJOEL I did? I must've been lying. I don't know... Maybe things'll get better when I sell the company. I'll be around more... \nDEAN Well, I hope so. That would suck... I get laid all the time. (off Joel's reaction) Sorry. \nJOEL Ah, it's all right... \n(THINKS) Actually, it sucks. \nDEAN Yeah, sexual frustration is bad news... You know what you oughtta do? \nJOEL What? \nDEAN Get some Xanax. \nJOEL Xanax? Isn't that for anxiety? \nDEAN Yeah it is, but I find it's good for just about any phsychological problem. I mean, basically it just makes you feel good, so it sort of works for anything. I even take it when I have a cold. It's probably great for sexual frustration. Want me to get you some? \nJOEL No. \nDEAN You know what else is good? Codeine cough syrup. \nJOEL For what? \nBRIAN Oh, by the way, guess who asked for a raise today? \nJOEL Who? \nBRIAN \n(GESTURES INDISCRIMINATELY to someone downstairs) Dinkus. Can you believe that? \nJOEL Brian, you call everyone here \"Dinkus.\" I don't know who you're talking about. \nBRIAN You know, Forklift-Dinkus? \nJOEL Oh... I thought you call him \"boy- genius.\" \nBRIAN Yeah, well boy-genius asked for a raise. I said, \"are you kidding? You nearly got someone killed last week,\" and then he blamed it on Dinkus over there. \nJOEL You know Brian, you really ought to learn the employees' names. \nBRIAN Well, I was thinking about that, but hey, if this deal goes through next week, I won't have to. It's not like I'm gonna be inviting Dinkus and Boy-Genius over for dinner. \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY \nJoel stands on one side of his office looking down through a long window overlooking the manufacturing area. Dean comes in, walks over to the window, looks down at the production floor with Joel. \nDEAN Hey man. What's goin' o-- Whoa! DEAN'S POV: It's CINDY, now working down on the floor, on the assembley line. \nDEAN (CONT'D) Damn! Who's she? Is she new? \nJOEL Yeah. She's a temp. \nDEAN She's a tramp? \nJOEL No a temp. Quit staring. \nDEAN Damn, she's hot! Way to go. \nJOEL Hey, I didn't hire her. She came here through Manpower, like everybody else. They just sent her over. \nDEAN Manpower, huh? Maybe I should give them a call. You don't usually have girls anywhere near that hot working here. What's the deal? \nJOEL Yeah, I know. I guess it makes sense though if you think about it. Hot girls need a job just as much as anyone else. \nDEAN (thinks for a second) Do they really?... Huh... You just don't see 'em here. Usually your temps look like winos. And they're guys. \nJOEL You wanna hear something really weird? \nDEAN What? \nJOEL She came on to me. \nDEAN No way! Really? \nJOEL Yeah. I mean, I'm pretty sure. I could be wrong, but... \nDEAN Hey, I'm sure she did. Are you kidding? You could have any girl down there. \nJOEL I don't know about that. \nDEAN I'm serious. Dude, you're the big shot here. You're the king of... What do you call that shit you make here again? \nINT. CINDY'S CAR - AFTERNOON \nCindy sits in her parked car, going through the purse Mary just described. She takes some cash, puts it in her pocket, then finds what she's looking for -- the address book. \nANGLE ON ADDRESS BOOK. Cindy turns to the Ws and finds Step Wilkenson. She notes his address. She starts the car and takes off. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF STEP'S HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER \nCindy sits and waits, listening to the radio. It's a very blue-collar neighborhood. She's about three houses away from Step's house, keeping an eye on it. After a beat, Step limps out of the house, walks over to his pickup truck, painfully gets in, and leaves. Cindy starts the car and follows from a distance. \nINT. GROCERY STORE - A LITTLE LATER \nStep wheels his shopping cart into one of the checkout lines. He uses the cart as a crutch to help him walk. Cindy gets in line behind him. She only has one item, a bottle of Reynold's Orange Extract. Step notices her. \nSTEP You can go ahead of me if that's all you have. \nCINDY \n(SWEETLY) Thank you so much. (holds up extract bottle) I can't believe I'm buying this stuff -- I work at the factory. \nSTEP Really? I work there too. Or, ah, I used to. \nCINDY Really? You're kidding! I just started there. What's your name? \nSTEP I go by Step. Yeah, I'm the fastest sorter there... As Cindy and Step get to know each other we \nCUT TO: \nINT. JOEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nJoel enters the living room. He first sees the sweatpants, then sees Suzie is sound asleep on the couch. He sighs, then turns and leaves. \nINT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT \nJoel sits at the bar talking to Dean. Joel is drinking some kind of hard liquor, getting a buzz. \nJOEL I'm sick of it Dean. I'm sick of being turned down in my own house by my own wife. We're turning into one of those brother-sister couples. \nDEAN Huh...Now that you mention it, you guys kind of look alike too. \nJOEL \n(GROSSED OUT) No we don't! \nDEAN Okay. \nJOEL (takes a drink) Maybe things will be better after I sell the company... Or maybe it's just going to mean more time to sit around and contemplate not getting laid. Dean nods sympathetically. \nDEAN What about that girl at work? She still into you? \nJOEL Yeah... she was really coming on to me. She gave me her phone number and everything. Told me to call her if I wanted to go to that party. Can you believe that? And there's nothing I can do about it, but just be sexually frustrated. \nDEAN I've got some Xanax if you want it. Like I say, that always works for me. \nJOEL No thanks... \nDEAN Well maybe you should call that girl. \nJOEL No, I can't. I can't cheat on Suzie. I just gotta power through it until I'm so old that I can't get it up anymore. \nEXT. LAKE -- SAME TIME \nStep's truck is parked out at a lake in the country. He and Cindy sit next to each other on the tailgate, looking at the stars, talking. \nSTEP I just believe that what's right is right. \nCINDY That's right Step, and what's right is for you to send a message. \nSTEP A message? \nCINDY You need to send a message so that a horrible accident like this never happens to anyone else ever again. That's what's right. And the way you do that is to take them to court. \nSTEP You think? \nCINDY Yes Step... That's why I called a lawyer for you -- that guy on all the bus stop benches. \nSTEP Joe Adler? \n(TOUCHED) You did that for me? \nCINDY Mmm hmm... I just want you to do what's right Step. They start cuddling, kissing. Cindy pulls away. \nCINDY I'm sorry Step, your doctor said you shouldn't get aroused. \nSTEP No he didn't. \nCINDY Maybe it was your lawyer, but he talked to your doctor. And your doctor said it's very important not to get aroused until after the trial... I'm sorry. \nSTEP That's okay... You're so good to me Cindy. They start cuddling again. \nCINDY Look Step, you're getting me turned on, I'm getting you turned on... I better just go. \nINT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- LATER \nJoel is starting to look really tweaked as the drug-alcohol combination begins to kick in. Dean is examining a pill under the cash register light, trying to read the small print. He looks concerned. \nDEAN Shit... Do you remember what color that pill I gave you was? \nJOEL Huh? \nDEAN Damn. I don't think it was Xanax. I think that might've been Ritalin... Or \"Special K.\" \nJOEL (feeling the buzz) Ah, who cares? \nDEAN It's just that, ah, Special K is a horse tranquilizer, kinda has a weird effect when people take it but... well, don't worry about it... You might not want to drink too much more though. \nJOEL (beginning to slur his \nSPEECH) You know that thing you were talking about? About the gigolo? \nDEAN Yeah? \nJOEL Do you think it would be wrong to do that? I mean morally wrong? \nDEAN (with full authority) Oh nooo. Definitely not. What could be morally wrong about it? \nJOEL I don't know... \nDEAN Look, if she doesn't want to go for it, she doesn't have to. And if she does, then she's the one who sinned, and then it's perfectly morally right for you to go out and boff whoever you want. \nBRAD Oooh, I see. Sorry man. Yeah, yeah. I get it now. You're not even gonna be there... \nJOEL Yeah, that's right. \nBRAD Yeah... cool. No problem. This is gonna be great! \nJOEL Remember, she might not go for it-- Brad starts to get a little too excited. \nBRAD Yeah, this is gonna be cool! I can hardly wait! Awesome. Hey man, if you know anyone else who needs -- you know -- what I do, like you know, lonely housewives and shit, maybe you could tell 'em about me, you know... Joel looks on with growing concern as Brad can't seem to stop talking. \nBRAD Cuz like, I figure if I did a few jobs and I was, like, really good? Then maybe they'd tell their friends, you know, and they'd give me a... what do you call those things? \nDEAN Referrals. \nBRAD Yeah yeah, those things. Then those women could tell more women and then it'd be like I was, like, uh... branching or.. \nDEAN Networking. \nBRAD Yeah, networking! Totally. Then if I got enough of 'em, maybe I could quit my landscaping job and do this full time. That would be awesome! Cause I hate landscaping. I like getting laid a lot better, and my boss is a total dick... \nEXT. SCOREBOARDS' PARKING LOT -- NIGHT \nJoel and Dean are at Dean's car, trying to say goodbye to Brad, who still won't shut up. \nBRAD Like I say, if your wife has any housewife friends who might-- Dean finally puts his foot down. \nDEAN Okay, you've said that a few times now Brad. Go on to your car. Okay? \nBRAD Alright. Cool. Like I say-- \nDEAN Goodnight Brad. \nBRAD Okay. See you later. Brad finally leaves. \nDEAN Let me drive you home. You're in no condition to drive. Joel stumbles into Dean's car. \nJOEL Are you sure about this guy Dean? He acts like he's never done this before. \nDEAN Oh no. He does it all the time. Don't worry. He just gets a little excited sometimes. He's cool. \nJOEL I don't know. He sure doesn't seem too bright. \nDEAN Yeah well, what do you excpect? He's a whore. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM - NEXT MORNING \nA break room with a kitchen. Joel is badly hungover. He looks like he's about to throw up as he reaches into the cupboard above the sink, downs a couple of aspirin, then drops some alka-seltzer in to a glass of water. Cindy comes in. \nCINDY Looks like you had one of those nights. \n(FLIRTATIOUS) Where was I? Joel nods, tries to grin and look cool as he takes a sip of his alkaseltzer. Then his eyes go wide, he almost does a spit-take as something suddenly dawns on him... \nJOEL Oh shit! He runs out of the room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE \nINT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING \nJoel and Suzie are eating dinner. Suzie has a glow about her, looking better than ever -- relaxed, satisfied, etc. Joel's has a quietly pissed off demeanor. They eat in silence for a beat. \nSUZIE So... How's work? \nJOEL It sucks. \nSUZIE Really? What's wrong? \nJOEL Nothing. Suzie looks a little puzzled. They keep eating in silence for a beat. \nJOEL I don't feel well. I'm going to bed. \nINT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - JOEL'S OFFICE - DAY \nFrom the window in his office, Joel watches Cindy working down on the production floor. Cindy looks up, they make eye contact for a brief moment. She gives him a flirtacious wave. Joel waves back. Then Rory comes by, starts talking to Cindy. \nINT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT /MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINOUS \nCINDY So you're in a band? \nRORY .Actually, I'm in five bands right now. But Godscock is basically the same four guys as Fighthead, but Fighthead's more of a thrash/skatepunk thing. Godscock is more melodic stuff. Cindy nods politely. Rory thinks she's interested. \nRORY (CONT'D) So you comin' Friday? \nCINDY Yeah, definitely. (looks at her watch) Ooh, I gotta go. Dentist appointment. \nRORY Cool. Cindy leaves. ANGLE ON Mary, on the other side of the room, watching them. She talks to Gabriella. \nMARY See, there he goes again, slowing us down. \n(RE: CINDY) Now she's a good sorter. They need to hire more people like her. \nGABRIELLA She's so nice too. Hector walks by. Mary just shakes her head. \nMARY I can't believe he's still working here. You know Silvia can't find her wallet. Thinks it was stolen. And guess who was in the locker room last? Hector. They both look at Hector and shake their heads in disgust. \nMARY You know, I could get a job at Southwest Airlines. My Niece works there. I'd get better benefits than we get here too. \nGABRIELLE Mmm hmm. I could get a job at Gemco. You think they would put up with this stuff at Gemco? Mmm mmn. They run a tight ship. \nMARY That's right. \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nJoel's POV of Mary and Gabrielle, yacking self-righteously. Joel looks on with disgust... \nJOEL \n(TO HIMSELF) Good riddance... Brian steps in, taps on the door. \nBRIAN You got a second? I think we might have a big problem here. I'm not sure what happened, but all of the sudden Step says he doesn't want to settle anymore. I think he might've talked to a lawyer. Joel goes to his desk, sits down. \nBRIAN Like I say, General Mills isn't going to make their offer official until this settles. Joel considers this. \nJOEL I think Step is just chest-beating. He does this all the time. He gets all wound up, talks big, then he always backs down. And that's with his balls. \nINT. PAROLE OFFICE - AFTERNOON \nWILLIE (still holding out the bong and lighter) Bullshit. \nDEAN Come on Joel. Don't worry, this stuff isn't that strong. (to Willie, re: Joel) \n(MORE) \nDEAN (CON T-D) He gets paranoid when he gets too stoned. Joel looks at Willie then at Dean, then takes the bong, partly out of being intimidated by Willie. \nJOEL Ah, what the hell. Willie instructs Joel on the bong usage in the same condescending way a weight-lifting instructor would. \nWILLIE Okay, now this is a gravity bong. Have you ever used one before? \nJOEL Umm, I think... no. \nWILLIE Okay, pay attention. Put your thumb right here on the carburetor. When I pull the plunger up and say, \"let go\" I want you to let go and inhale hard. Joel's POV: Looking down the barrel of the three-foot bong with macho-man Willie holding the lighter at the bowl. \nWILLIE (CONT'D) Okay exhale! \nJOEL You know, maybe I should just let \nYOU GUYS-- \nWILLIE (starting to get scary) Bullshit! EXHALE HARD! Mostly out of fear, Joel exhales. Willie puts the bong up to Joel's face, lights it and starts lifting the plunger. Then pushes it down. \nWILLIE (CONT'D) Let go! Inhale! NOW! Joel lets go of the carburator, inhales. \nWILLIE (CONT'D) \n(INSANE) \nGO! GO! HARDER!!! \nJoel inhales with all his might, sucking up massive amounts of thick pot smoke as Willie pushes down the plunger. \nSTONER-RIPPLE \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT Willie, Dean and Joel sitting around, completely baked -- especially Joel. (We play most of the scene from Joel's stoned, paranoid POV.) Dean makes some kind of barely audible mumble -- or did he? \nJOEL What? Long pause. \nDEAN Huh? Joel's POV: looking from Dean to Willie. Willie sits there with red eyes barely open. Willie turns slowly to Joel. \nWILLIE Huh? \nJOEL Oh, I thought somebody said something. Willie looks at Joel, stone-faced, adding even further to Joel's paranoia. He stares at Joel for a long beat. Then, in an instant, he's right up in Joel's face. \nWILLIE \nBWAAAAAAAAAAAH!!! Joel jumps back, scared shitless. Willie starts laughing his ass off. \nWILLIE Haaaah ha... The look on your face! \n(INSANE CACKLE) Man you really do get paranoid when you get stoned. \nJOEL (fake, timid laugh) Yeah, heh heh... \nDEAN Hey Joel, why don't you call that chick now? \nJOEL Yes. \nDEAN Wow. Man, that really goes to show you -- this town is smaller than you think. You really gotta be careful. Joel hangs up and walks out of his office, past his Secretary. \nJOEL I'm not feeling well. I'm going to go home early. \nINT. JOEL'S CAR -- DAY \nJoel turns the corner to his house and does a double-take as he sees BRAD'S TRUCK going the opposite direction. \nJOEL Shit! Joel slams on the brakes, turns around, chases Brad's truck down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop. They both get out of their vehicles. Joel is livid. \nJOEL What the hell were you doing on my street again?! \nBRAD Dude, you weren't supposed to be home for another four hours-- Whoa, what happened to your face? \nJOEL (trying to improvise a tough, snappy comeback, but can't quite make it \nWORK) \n(MORE) \nJOEL (CONT'D) The same thing that's gonna happen.. Your face is gonna look worse if... GOD DAMMIT! If I ever catch you anywhere near my house or my wife again, I'll have you arrested. \nBRAD For what? Suzie let me in. Joel is stumped -- Brad actually has a point. \nJOEL What the hell is wrong with you anyway? Do you do this with all your clients -- just keep coming back and hanging around? \nBRAD I don't know. This is my first one. \nJOEL What?! I thought you were a professional! \nBRAD Look man, I know she's your wife an' shit, but you might as well know -- I think we're in love. \nJOEL In love?! \n(COMING UNGLUED) HA! Man are you stupid. You are so goddamn dumb. You think she loves you? You're nothing but a piece of ass to her. That's all. \nBRAD I don't think so dude. \nJOEL Oh, you don't think so \"dude?\" Well did you ever think about this: she doesn't even know that I paid you to have sex with her -- did that cross your small mind? \nBRAD Uuh.. \nJOEL How about I go home right now and tell her? Tell her you did it for the money. How about that loverboy? Brad suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out. \nBRAD You wouldn't do that. \nJOEL You don't think so? Watch me. \nBRAD (realizing he's serious) No... Dude, please don't. Please? Joel starts back to his car. \nBRAD Look man, we really have a special thing going on. Please don't mess it up... Joel stops. \nJOEL Don't mess it up?! You're talking about my wife! My house! Stupid- ass! Joel gets in his car and starts it. \nBRAD (calls out to him) Dude, you can't do this to me. \nJOEL Oh yes I can... Joel peels out, drives half a block and turns into his driveway. \nSTEP You know, my lawyer told me not to talk to you. \n(BEAT) You're not here to try to talk me out of suing are you? \nJOEL Oh, no... No, I'm just kind of curious about... ah... So you've been going out with Cindy, huh? \nSTEP Yes sir. She's my girlfriend. We might even get married after all this lawsuit-settlement stuff gets worked out. \nJOEL .so some of the guys at work are saying you gave Cindy that black eye. \nSTEP What? That ain't true at all. \nJOEL Yeah, I know it's not. \nSTEP She got it from falling down some stairs. \nJOEL Hmm... Look, you might wanna be careful with Cindy. \nSTEP \n(DEFENSIVE) What do you mean? \nJOEL Well, I'm not sure how to put this, but... You know, you got a lot of money coming your way with this settlement. You might wanna be \nCAREFUL-- \nSTEP Oh no. No, she didn't even know about that 'til after we started going out. \nJOEL You sure about that? \nSTEP Oh yeah. I didn't tell her about it for a while 'cuz I was kind of embarrassed, you know? You don't tell a girl you just met that you lost one of your balls. Especially a girl as hot as Cindy. \nJOEL Yeah... \n(DELICATELY) You know she lives with this guy Willie right? \nSTEP That's her ex. She broke up with him. She's gonna move out. She just needs to get all her stuff outta there. \nJOEL You sure about that? \nSTEP Oh yeah. She's moving in with me. \nJOEL Oh. Hmm... \nSTEP Look, I know Cindy's got some problems, but she means well. She's the best thing that ever happened to me. \nJOEL Well, okay... If you say so. Another thing -- you just might want to watch your back. Some of the guys at work who think you gave Cindy the black eye were talking about paying you a visit -- you know, getting even. \nSTEP Oh. Well I'm not worried about that. (dead-serious, proud) I could kick anyone's ass at that whole company. \nINT. JOEL'S HOUSE - DAY \nBrad and Suzie are by the pool which is filthy. Brad starts coming on to Suzie. She pushes him away. \nSUZIE No Brad, we can't. I'm sorry, but we have to stop doing this. \nBRAD Why? \nSUZIE It's not right. I feel horrible. Besides, I think Joel's getting suspicious. And you gotta start cleaning the pool too. \nINT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - EMPLOYEE BREAK ROOM - DAY \nA bunch of employees including Mary, Garielle, and Rory are talking, getting worked up. \nRORY .And when they sell the company, Joel and Brian are gonna be the one's who get rich, and-- \nMARY And we're the ones doing all the work. \nGABRIELLE That's right. \nRORY It's bullshit man. We should get a piece of it. I work my ass off. \nMARY Gabrielle and I work harder than anybody. I should be making what Brian makes. If you add up all the crates I move, I lift 10,000 pounds a day. Minimum. \nGABRIELLE That's right. Here he's gonna make a million dollars, and we're the ones who do everything. I went to college. For three years. \nMARY If we quit, this place couldn't run. They wouldn't be able to sell this place for anything. JIM, a tall skinny 50-something guy with a ridiculously big mustache and a little paunch, chimes in. \nJIM That's why what we should do is, is we should all go on strike -- demand stock in the company before it sells. If General Mills knew we were on strike, they wouldn't buy this place until the strike was over. That way they'd have to give us stock. Jim points to his head, gives everyone a \"how's that\" nod. It starts to build steam. \nRORY That's right man. We should do it. We should strike. \nMARY That's right. I could get a job at Gemco like that. At Gemco, all the employees are owners -- even says so on the name tags. \nGABRIELLE Mmm hmm. I could get a job at Southwest Airlines... \nINT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - CONFRENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe meeting is already in progress. On Adler's side of the table are two other lawyers and a couple of paralegals. On Joel's side it's just he, Brian and Joel's secretary. Maybe one lawyer who doesn't say much. Everybody has in front of them a small stack of documents. The confrence room, like Joel's office, has a full length window facing the manufacturing area. \nADLER Ok gentlemen. We've gone through everything and the only way we would even begin to consider a settlement would be to the tune of the number you see on the bottom of page 18. Does everyone have this? Joel and the rest of them find page 18. Joel is stunned by the number. \nJOEL What!!!? (so pissed he can barely get the words out) We don't have this much money! Not even close! \nADLER Not in cash you don't. Of course not. But if you were to sell off your assets: the property lease, the equipment, the-- \nJOEL What the ff-- Are you shitting me!? That would bankrupt us! \nBRIAN This is what I've been trying to tell you Joel... \nJOEL If you think I'm just going to give up this entire company that I built from the ground up-- Adler jumps up, dripping with phoney, forced indignation. \nADLER How about what my client gave up!? His testicles! How about that!? He walks over to the door... \nADLER In fact, I'll make a deal with you - - we will drop this case right now if you come over here and put your testicles right here (indicates the space between the door and the \nHINGES) and let me slam this door like this... Adler SLAMS the door ridiculously hard. \nADLER Go ahead. We can settle this right now -- call it even. I will drop this case right now if you let me slam your balls in this door, \nBECAUSE THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED TO MY \nCLIENT! \nJOEL It was an accident! \nADLER Not according to our investigation. We believe that, in fact, there was gross negligence... \nINT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA - CONTINUOUS \nSUZIE Listen Joel, there's something I have to tell you. I think we need to be honest with each other. Suzie sits down. \nSUZIE (CONT'D) I'm not sure how to say this, but -- well, you've been so caught up in you're work lately, and I'm here alone all day and sometimes I just-- \nJOEL You banged the pool cleaner. \nSUZIE Wha... Suzie is stunned. \nJOEL That's what you're trying to tell me right? You had sex with Brad? \nSUZIE You knew? \nJOEL Yes I knew. I hired him. \nSUZIE Well I know you hired him, but how did you know about-- \nJOEL I don't mean I hired him to clean the pool, I mean I hired him to have sex with you. \nSUZIE What? \nJOEL He's a gigolo Suzie. Suzie is stupefied. \nSUZIE But... what... Why? Joel is so fed up, he just tells her everything. \nJOEL I hired him to have an affair with you so that I could have an affair without feeling guilty. I was really drunk and on some kind of horse tranquilizer and-- \nSUZIE Brad was getting paid?... (disbelief, hurt) So you've been paying Brad this whole time? All fifteen times?! \nJOEL FIFTEEN TIMES?! Jesus Christ Suzie! Joel sinks into his chair, shaking his head. \nJOEL (CONT'D) I only paid him once -- well, twice. The rest was on the house. Long beat as Suzie tries to let it all sink in. \nSUZIE You wanted to have an affair with another woman? \nJOEL Yes. But I didn't. Suzie paces around for a moment, reeling, processing all this. Then, decisively, \nSUZIE You asshole. \nJOEL Oh, I'm the asshole? \nSUZIE Yes! How could you? \nJOEL \n(LAUGHS) How could I? How could you?!!! You didn't have to have sex with him. You could've simply said \"No thanks. Just clean the pool,\" but you didn't, did you?! No, you took him up on his little offer and had sex with him -- fifteen times! \nSUZIE None of this would've happened if you hadn't hired him. \nJOEL Okay. I'll admit, I made a big mistake. I was drunk, on drugs, stressed, sexually frustrated and I shouldn't have hired a male prostitute to seduce you. But if you had simply been faithful, none of this would've happened. Suzie just looks at him for a beat. \nSUZIE You're sick, you know that? Beat. Joel can't really argue this point. \nJOEL What do you see in Brad anyway? He's borderline retarded. You probably could've been arrested for having sex with a guy that dumb. \nSUZIE That's it. I'm leaving. Suzie heads for the door. Joel follows after her. \nJOEL No. You're not leaving me. I'm leaving you! \nSUZIE Fine. Joel opens the door, about to storm out, only to find NATHAN, standing right there about to ring the doorbell. \nBRAD Oh, one more thing... I quit my landscaping job... And I don't think I'm really cut out to be a gigolo. So I was wondering if you had any openings over there at your extract place? \nJOEL \n(EXASPERATED SIGH) Brad, you had sex with my wife. I'm not gonna give you a job, okay? \nBRAD Okay... Sorry man. Brad walks away. Joel stares at his beer for a beat, thinking. He calls out to Brad. \nJOEL Hey Brad?... Brad stops. \nBRAD Yeah? \nJOEL I don't know... Maybe come by the office tomorrow. Fill out an application. I'll see what I can do. \nBRAD Cool. Thanks man. \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE - NEXT DAY \nBrian sits with Joel. They both look pretty miserable. Brian looks down at some papers, shaking his head. \nBRIAN We're screwed. General Mills has pretty much withdrawn the offer pending a really favorable settlement with Step. (shaking his head) Not only do we not sell the company, we could wind up bankrupt. \nJOEL (muttering to himself) So I don't sell the company, don't get the money, I'm bankrupt, I don't get Cindy, I paid a guy to have sex with my wife, and she actually did it... \nBRIAN Excuse me? \nJOEL Nothing. \nEXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY \nSuzie is trying to clean the pool herself, struggling with the long pole with the net at the end. She looks miserable. \nNATHAN (O.S.) Hello? Nathan enters through the back gate. \nSUZIE \n(MUTTERS) Shit... Nathan walks over to Suzie. She's in no mood for this. She acts as unfriendly as possible. \nNATHAN Why are you cleaning the pool yourself? That new guy didn't work out? \nSUZIE Yeah, didn't work out. \nNATHAN Boy, you just can't get good help, eh? \nSUZIE Yeah. \nNATHAN So, did you get a chance to write that check? \nSUZIE Look Nathan, Joel and I aren't going to that dinner okay? Nathan acts deeply disappointed. \nNATHAN Well gee, I wish you would've told me that before I went and bought the tickets. \nSUZIE Joel never agreed to this Nathan, and neither did I. \nNATHAN Well, it sure sounded like you guys were going. Leslie was gonna talk to you about it, but you didn't return our calls. I mean, I already bought these tickets. They're nonrefundable. I really wish you guys had been a little more clear with me... It's the last straw. Suzie has had enough. She unleashes all her pent-up aggression on Nathan. \nSUZIE Okay, let me be really clear with you then. When we say \"I don't think so,\" or even \"I'm not sure,\" that means \"no.\" Why can't you understand that? \nNATHAN Well, I just-- \nCINDY I have no idea what you're talking about. \nJOEL Yes you do! You're the only reason he's suing us aren't you? You know how much work it took for me to build up that company? You just don't care about anybody do you? What are you, some kind of sociopath? Cindy looks like Joel might be getting to her. \nJOEL (CONT'D) You can't even admit that you stole this purse can you? You just can't do it. \n(MORE) \nJOEL (CONT'D) In fact, you probably can't tell the truth about much of anything, can you?... Cindy turns away from him, looking down at the floor. \nJOEL I bet Cindy's not even your real name is it? Who are you? Where the hell are you from? Cindy, still looking away, doesn't answer. \nJOEL (CONT'D) You can't answer can you? Because if you said one true thing, you'd have to tell the truth about something else and then it would all unravel wouldn't it? Then you'd have to admit that you stole this purse and God knows what else. Beat. Cindy still looking away, down at the floor. We see her eyes well up, about to cry, but Joel doesn't notice. \nJOEL \n(COMPOSES HIMSELF) Well, I'm leaving now. Joel picks up the purse. \nJOEL And I'm taking this purse with me. If it really is yours, you can call the police and tell 'em I stole it... In fact, I'm gonna call the police and report it... Joel walks towards the door. Then Cindy slumps down on the couch, mutters something, still looking down at the floor, her voice cracking slightly. \nCINDY Please don't... Joel stops. \nJOEL What? \nCINDY (still looking down) Please don't report it to the police. I'm on probation. I'll go to jail. For a long time. \nJOEL Well... Maybe you should've thought about that before you started ripping off my employees. Joel starts to open the door. \nCINDY Joel? Please? I'll leave Step alone. I promise. He'll drop the lawsuit. Joel considers this. \nJOEL How do I know that? \nCINDY You can keep the purse. If I don't leave him alone; if he doesn't drop the lawsuit, then you can report me. Please? Beat. \nJOEL Hmm... I guess that ah... Do you have Sylvia's wallet, and Jim's watch? Can I get those too? Beat. Cindy nods, still looking down. Joel considers it. \nJOEL Well... Okay then. I guess that works. \n(REALIZING) And I guess you just admitted that you stole the purse. That's good, I guess... A step in the right direction... Joel sits down on the couch also. With her head still down, Cindy is weeping quietly. Joel doesn't notice, looking straight ahead. \nJOEL So what's your deal anyway?... I mean, how did you end up like this? Joel finally looks over, notices that she's crying. He's caught off guard. \nJOEL .Ah... Cindy? Cindy breaks down and starts bawling. \nJOEL (CONT'D) Okay, now you see... that's what I'm talking about. You're trying to manipulate me now, and I'm not gonna fall for it... Cindy starts bawling even harder. \nJOEL (CONT'D) I really hope you're not faking this right now, because I'm feeling really bad. Are you faking it? Cindy shakes her head \"no.\" \nJOEL I'm sorry, I was just curious, you know, how a person ends up like... this... Cindy suddenly starts BAWLING hysterically. Joel stands there awkwardly, not sure if he should hug her or comfort her in any way. \nJOEL Never mind. I'm sorry... Joel tentatively puts a comforting arm around her and she leans in to him, crying on his chest. He puts his other arm around her and she snuggles in even closer. As her crying gradually subsides she snuggles in even more. Finally, she lifts her head and they start kissing. As they get hot and heavy we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. EXTENDED STAY AMERICA SUITES -- MORNING \nWide shot of the Hotel. It's a beautiful morning. \nINT. CINDY'S ROOM - DAY \nJOEL Yeah... I'm beginning to think I might be the same way... I'm a little worried about what I'd do with too much time on my hands. \nSTEP I just lay around and watch TV all day. \nJOEL Yeah,... I think I do a lot worse. \nSTEP The problem is, if I bankrupt the company, there won't be a job to go back to. \nJOEL You don't have to bankrupt the company. \nSTEP Yeah, but then if I drop the lawsuit, you'll sell the company, and the new company might not hire me. \nJOEL Well, maybe I don't have to sell the company... You know I've been thinking; all these years I've been building this company, dreaming about the day I could sell it and retire, but what would I really do if I retired? It's like that old saying -- it's not about the destination, it's about the journey? Step just stares at him blankly, he lost him. \nJOEL I guess what I'm saying is, too much free time might not be such a good thing -- like that old saying, idle hands are the Devil's playground? Step's never heard that one either. \nSTEP I'm sorry, I don't do much book readin'. \nJOEL What I'm saying is, I'm thinking maybe I won't sell the company... \nSTEP Really? \nJOEL that is, if you dropped the lawsuit. -- and remember, you'll still get that insurance money -- probably a couple hundred thousand. What do you think? \nSTEP Hmm. That sounds fair... But under one condition... \nJOEL What's that? \nSTEP You make me floor manager. \nJOEL Deal. They shake hands. \nINT. REYNOLDS EXTRACT - MANUFACTURING AREA \nJoel walks in with Step at his side. Addresses the employees. \nJOEL Hold the line! Mary shuts off the conveyer belt. \nJOEL Okay, listen up everybody. (Waits for them to settle) I've decided not to sell the company... Gasps and murmurs among the employees. \nJOEL And I'm making Step the new Floor Manager. More gasps and murmurs. \nJOEL And if anyone doesn't like it, I hear they're hiring over at Gemco... But just remember, at Gemco, the owner doesn't know your names; you never even meet him, he's at an office up in Chicago somewhere and you get an auto- response if you try to email him to complain about anything. Here, you can come up to my office any time you have a problem. Thanks. Joel walks off. Brian catches up with him. \nBRIAN Huh? You're not selling? \nJOEL It's about the journey Brian. The journey. ANGLE on Mary. She and Gabrielle start right back up. \nMARY You know, if Joel's going to put him in charge, we should go on strike. You know, at Gemco, the union handles the strikes and you don't even have to-- PULL OUT as Step cuts her off. \nSTEP Quit yapping and get back to work or you're fired. Step walks off -- maybe pops a testosterone pill. Mary and Gabrielle keep muttering and shaking their heads. LONG PULL OUT as things get back to normal at the factory. \nINT. CHAPEL - DAY \nWe are CLOSE ON NATHAN, in a coffin, embalmed. We PULL OUT to see mourners lined up, taking a last look at the body. Joel is among them. He looks down at Nathan for a moment and then continues to his seat. A few rows back, we see SUZIE, sitting by herself, dressed in black. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nQuick shot of Nathan's casket being lowered into the ground as the priest says the last few words. \n", "test1_input": "JOEL Who? \nSECRETARY Brad Chavez. He said he's done with the job you guys talked about at your house? Do you want me to take a message? Joel looks pale. \nJOEL Um, no... He's the ah, pool cleaner. I better take that. Joel goes back in his office. HOLD on Brian, confused. \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nJoel stares at the phone for a beat then picks it up. \nJOEL Hello? \nBRAD (V.0.) Hey, is this Joel? \nJOEL Yes. \nBRAD (V.0.) Hey, it's Brad. Mission accomplished dude. \nJOEL What do you mean? \nBRAD (V.0.) I mean it worked. She totally went for it. \nJOEL What? What're you...? (looks at his watch) You weren't even supposed to be there for another 45 minutes. \nBRAD (V.0.) Oh really? I forgot what time you guys said, and I was so excited about it, I just went over there. Joel sits down, freaked out. \nJOEL (reality setting in) So you mean she actually ah... you guys...? \nBRAD (V.0.) Yup. It was easy. \nJOEL \n(AGITATED) Easy? What do you mean \"easy\"? \nBRAD (V.0.) Oh, I don't mean easy like she was easy -- like she was a slut or anything. I just mean it wasn't hard to get her to... Never mind. \nJOEL No. Tell me. Tell me how it happened. \n(BRACES HIMSELF) I wanna hear everything. \nBRAD You sure? \nJOEL Yeah. \nBRAD (V.0.) Okay. Well, she let me in, so I went back like I was cleaning the pool... \nEXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - POOL -- DAY \nAs Brad's dopey narration continues, we see the story he's telling. It plays out like a bad soft-porn flick on Cinemax. We see Brad wiping the side of the pool with a rag. \nBRAD (V.0.) .I don't know anything about pool cleaning, so I was just faking it. She was in her bathing suit... Suzie comes out and lies on one of the reclining chairs. \nBRAD (V.0.) .So I struck up a conversation... \nBRAD This is a really nice house. \nSUZIE Thanks. \nBRAD Is it your Dad's house? \n", "test1_true": "BRAD Wow, you look so young to be living in a house this nice. \nSUZIE Oh, thanks. Beat. \nBRAD Do you have any sunscreen? I forgot mine. \nBrad's dopey narration comes back in... \nBRAD (V.0.) I thought that was pretty smart of me -- to ask her to borrow sunscreen. See, 'cuz that way, once she gave me some, I could ask her if she wanted some too, and rub some on her back, instead of just coming out and asking her to rub some on her. Pretty smooth huh?... We see Brad rubbing lotion on Suzie's back as she lies face- down on the chair. \nBRAD (V.0.) Once I was rubbing the sunscreen on her, the rest was easy... We see Brad's hands working their way down Suzie's back. Just as they start to move down towards her butt, Joel interrupts, YANKING US OUT OF THE FLASHBACK. \nJOEL Okay that's enough! Stop! \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nJOEL I don't need to hear anymore. \nBRAD (V.0.) Okay, cool. Hey, like I say, if you know of anyone else, or if you ever need me to do it again-- \nJOEL NO! No. Look, I gotta go. Bye. Joel hangs up the phone and falls back into his chair, in a state of shock. \nJOEL (quietly, to himself) Holy shit. \nINT. JOEL'S CAR - LATE AFTERNOON \nJoel drives home from work. He still looks freaked out. He notices something ahead, and suddenly SLAMS ON THE BREAKS. \nJOEL Dammit ! JOEL'S POV: Nathan, the guy across the street is in his front yard, puttering around with the mail. \nJOEL \n(TO HIMSELF) No... not today... Joel puts the car in reverse, starts to pull behind a parked car in an attempt to hide, but Nathan notices him, waves and crosses the street. Joel reluctantly pulls ahead to his driveway. \nNATHAN How's it goin'? \nJOEL Oh, I'm kind of busy actually. \nNATHAN Yeah. Well I won't keep you. I just wanted to let you know, I got those tickets to that dinner we talked about on the 7th. I think I told you they were forty dollars a piece, but it turns out it's a tad more this year -- fifty-five -- so if I could go ahead and just get a check from you guys... \nJOEL Look, ah, we can't go. Remember? \nNATHAN No, this is the 7th. You said you're going out of town on the 17th. \nJOEL Yeah, but remember, I told you we didn't really want to go to this thing. Nathan looks dumbfounded. Joel is about to snap. \nNATHAN But I already bought the tickets. I know you said something about her feeling uncomfortable, but, like I say, she won't feel uncomfortable at all -- I guarantee it. \n(MORE) \nNATHAN (CONT'D) It's just a whole lot of fun. You guys'll have a great time. \nJOEL Look, I gotta get going. \nNATHAN Alright then... Joel starts to pull away. \nNATHAN (CONT'D) Oh, one more thing -- Joel just keeps driving, almost knocking Nathan over. \n", "test1_id": 123, "test2_input": "CINDY (CONT'D) I'll also put my number on here. In case you want to call me some time -- if you want. Joel blushes awkwardly, like a junior high school kid. \nJOEL Um... Okay. Sure. \nEXT. JOEL'S HOUSE - EVENING \nJoel pulls into the driveway and is STARTLED as he practically runs over Nathan, flagging him down. Joel MUTTERS obscenities as he reluctantly stops and rolls down the window. \nNATHAN Hi there. Almost missed ya. \nJOEL Hi. I can't talk right now-- \nNATHAN Hey, I noticed you guys got a new pool cleaner today. How is he? We're thinking of changing services. \nJOEL Look Nathan, I gotta... Wait, you mean yesterday, don't you? \nNATHAN Huh? \nJOEL The new pool cleaner. You saw him yesterday right? Not today. \nNATHAN No. It was today. The new guy. \nJOEL What'd he look like? \nNATHAN Blonde haired kid, about this high, good looking. Real good looking. \nIN FACT-- \nJOEL You sure it was today? Not yesterday? \nNATHAN Yeah. \nJOEL You're absolutely sure? \nNATHAN Yeah. I know it was today, because I came home for lunch. I was gone all day yesterday. Anyway, you think I could go ahead and get that check from ya? Like I say, it's 55 dollars a plate, so that'd be 110 total. There's no tax... Nathan leans up to scratch his back. Joel seizes the opportunity and pulls away, burning a little rubber. \nINT. JOEL'S HOUSE - BEDROOM -- MOMENTS LATER \nJoel is on his cell phone, yelling in hushed tones at Brad. He has the door shut so Suzie won't hear him. \nJOEL What the hell were you doing at my house today?! \nBRAD (V.0.) Oh, umm... nothing. \nJOEL Bullshit! \nBRAD (V.0.) Look, don't worry about it bro'. I won't charge you for this one. \nJOEL Won't charge me for...? You had sex with my wife again?! \nBRAD (V.0.) Well, I figured we already did it once, so what's the big deal? I mean, she said to stop by if I was in the neighborhood, so... Besides, I'm not gonna charge you-- \nJOEL Not gonna charge...? God damn you! Yes you are gonna charge me! I'm gonna pay you! You're not having sex with my wife for free! And I better not ever catch you anywhere near my house ever again! Joel slams down the phone. Then realizes it's a cell phone, picks it back up and hits the \"End\" button. \nINT. JOEL'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT \nSuzie is asleep on the couch in her sweatpants. Joel walks through, mumbles something about going to a party. \nINT. JOEL'S CAR -- NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "They all have that baggy-shorts tattooed mid-nineties look. It's downright pathetic. There's one drunk guy off to the side banging his head, playing air-guitar and stumbling into the bushes. Joel spots Cindy over by the keg, drinking, mingling. He watches her for a beat, then shakes his head and drives away. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SCOREBOARDS SPORTS BAR -- NIGHT \nJoel sits at the bar talking to Dean, drinking a beer. \nJOEL I can't believe my wife slept with that guy. \nDEAN Well... I thought you said it wouldn't bother you. \nJOEL I guess I didn't really think about it long enough... I just wish it hadn't been so easy for him. \nDEAN Yeah, I'm tellin' ya, chicks really go wild for that Brad... (Off Joel's look) Sorry. \nJOEL No, you're right. He may be a stupid, dull-witted moron, but he can get any girl he wants. Me, I had to work for it. I had to work hard, get a career going, take Suzie out a bunch of times, marry her. But not Brad. He gets to waltz into my house and have sex with my wife just like that. Oh, and by the way? That little prick was at my house again today. \nDEAN No shit? What was he doing? \nJOEL Take a wild guess. \nDEAN Wow... You pay a guy to do a job, then he comes back and does it for free. \nJOEL I'm not going to let him do it for free. No way. I'm paying him. \nDEAN Really? How much? \nJOEL Oh, I don't know. The same, I guess. Why? \nDEAN Hmm... So should I get my twenty dollars from Brad then or... Joel shoots Dean an angry look. \nDEAN (CONT'D) We can worry about that later... Look at the bright side, now you can call Cindy. \nJOEL I don't know... I feel weird about it. Besides, she's at the party, she probably won't be home 'til late. \nDEAN You know what you need to do? \nJOEL (rolling his eyes) I don't wanna do drugs Dean. \nDEAN Look, I know I joke around a lot, but this time I'm serious. (like a doctor) You should try smoking a little pot. It's just an herb, it heals. Stress can kill you, and-- \nJOEL I get paranoid when I smoke pot. \nDEAN Not when you just smoke a little. Come on. You ever meet my friend Willie? Great guy. Really great guy. (as if it's a positive) He's the guy I got that horse tranquilizer from. \nJOEL Oh, wonderful. \nINT. WILLIE'S APARTMENT -- NIGHT \nWILLIE loads up some kind of giant three-foot tall bong and inhales a massive bong-load. He's a burly ex-football player type who looks like he might have an extra y-chromosome or two. Joel watches Willie, feeling a little uneasy. Dean pontificates. \nDEAN I've been reading about it -- they're making technological advances now, coming up with great drugs that can make you happy and won't leave you with a hangover or nothin'. \nWILLIE (holding in bong-hit) Right on. Willie finally exhales. The exhale seems to go on way longer than humanly possible, endless amounts of pot-smoke billowing out (accomplished with special FX). He finally hands the bong and lighter to Joel. \nJOEL Oh, I don't know... I'm kind of a light weight. I think that's too much for me-- \n", "test2_id": 124, "test3_input": "DEAN Well, it looks like you guys got a lot to talk about here so I think I'm just gonna go ahead and take off. Later guys. Dean bolts. Willie moves in closer on Joel. Joel starts to leave, but Willie blocks him. \nWILLIE Kinda slutty? Willie grabs Joel and throws him against the wall. Joel tries to make a break for the door, but Willie hauls off and punches him across the face. The ass-kicking begins as we \nCUT TO: \nINT. JOEL'S HOUSE -- NIGHT \nJoel limps into the house, his face bruised black and blue from the ass-kicking. He looks awful. As he limps into the bedroom as quietly as possible, he trips on something, waking up Suzie. She turns on a light and sees Joel. \nSUZIE Oh my God Joel, are you alright? What happened? \nJOEL I'm fine. I'm fine. I just ah... got my ass kicked. Go back to sleep. \nSUZIE What? By who? What happened? \nJOEL It was just... some guy over at Scoreboards. \nSUZIE Let me drive you to the hospital. You need to get checked out. \nJOEL No. I'll be fine. I just want to sleep right now, okay? \nSUZIE You sure you're okay? It looks like your nose is broken, and your \nEYE-- \nJOEL \n(AGITATED) Don't worry about it! People get their asses kicked all the time! It's no big deal. Go back to sleep. \nINT. REYNOLD'S EXTRACT BUILDING - MORNING \nJoel walks past his Secretary. \nSECRETARY Hi Joel. Brian wanted to see you-- \n(NOTICING) Oh my God, what happened? Joel keeps walking, MUMBLES something about falling down some stairs, goes into his office and shuts the door. \nINT. JOEL'S OFFICE -- CONTINUOUS ACTION \nJoel walks over to the window overlooking the production area. He looks down and sees Cindy working, with her back turned. Shakes his head. Brian KNOCKS on the door and enters, looking worried. \nBRIAN Hi... Did you talk to Step yet? \nJOEL He isn't returning my calls. \nBRIAN Shit... We've got problems. He did hire a lawyer -- Joe Adler -- he's that personal injury lawyer you see on all the bus-stop benches. You oughtta see this guy. He's a real piece of shi-- (noticing Joel's face) Oh man, what happened to you? \nJOEL Oh, I fell down some stairs. \nBRIAN Damn... Well anyway, I hate to say this, but I think we're screwed. There's no way this Adler guy is gonna settle for anything less then bankrupting us. Says he'll sue us into the stone age. \nJOEL (clutches his head \nMISERABLE) Shit... I gotta talk to Step. Brian looks at Joel's bruised face. \nBRIAN Man, everyone's getting hurt. Cindy came in with a black eye today. You hear how she got it? \nJOEL Ah... no. \n", "test3_true": "JOEL No he--! \n(CATCHES HIMSELF) What? Where did you hear that? \nBRIAN That's what she told Mary. \nJOEL But... Step? Does he even know her? \nBRIAN Apparently they've been going out. \nJOEL What?! \nBRIAN I know, it's weird. They didn't even meet here. They met at a grocery store or something. Just a total coincidence. Joel looks down at Cindy on the production floor, his mind reeling. \nBRIAN Anyway, we're gonna have to hire a couple of new people because \nCINDY'S QUITTING-- \nJOEL Really? \nBRIAN Yep. And if it's okay with you, I'd like to go ahead and fire Hector. \nJOEL Fire Hector? What for? \nBRIAN You know, Mary's purse? Sylvia's wallet? It's gotta be him. Who else could it be? Joel looks down at Cindy with growing suspicion. \nJOEL No. Don't fire him. Just trust me on this. Give him another week. If anything else is stolen, then you can fire him. \nBRIAN \n(PUZZLED) Alright. If you say so. Brian looks Joel over. \nBRIAN (CONT'D) Man, are you okay? Have you seen a doctor? Joel's Secretary BEEPS in. \nSECRATARY (V.0.) Joel, Dean is on line one for you. \nJOEL Okay, thanks. \n(TO BRIAN) I better get this. Brian leaves. \nJOEL (CONT'D) Hello. \nDEAN Hey man. Sorry I bailed on you like that last night. It's just that I don't like to get involved in other people's personal shit, you know what I mean? \nJOEL Uh-huh. \nDEAN I didn't even know Willie had a girlfriend. She must be new. Man, Willie looked pissed. \n(CHUCKLES) \n(MORE) \nDEAN (CON T'D) I thought he was gonna take a swing at you there for a second. \nJOEL He did take a swing at me Dean. Several swings. In fact, he beat the living shit out of me. \nDEAN Whoa, really? \n", "test3_id": 125}

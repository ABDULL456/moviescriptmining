About to kiss, Gatsby is struck by a sudden instinctive thought... 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT 
Gatsby remembers... 
GATSBY So I stopped. And I waited... I waited... 
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT 
Gatsby's eyes drift up... 
GATSBY (BY THE POOL) I waited for a moment longer. 
He looks out the dark, crystal windows, beyond the trees... to a staircase of moonlight, climbing up, up, up... 
NICK (V.O.) He knew that if he kissed this girl his mind would never again be free to romp like... the mind of God... That falling in love would change his destiny... forever. 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT 
GATSBY And then I just let myself go. 
INT. DAISY'S HOUSE - CONSERVATORY/ATRIUM - NIGHT 
With sudden resolve Gatsby kisses Daisy... 
In ravenous embrace, they fall onto the long sofa lounge. 
NICK (V.O.) She blossomed for him like a flower... 
ECU: Daisy, her lips tremble, eyes wide, breath quickening.. 
NICK (V.O.) And the incarnation was complete. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - POOL - NIGHT 
The other layers of IMAGERY IN THE CLOUDS MELT AWAY, leaving Nick and Gatsby standing by the pool. 
GATSBY I knew it was a great mistake for a man like me to fall in love. A great mistake. I'm only 32... I might still be a great man if I could only forget that I once lost Daisy. But my life, old sport, my life has got to be like this... 
He draws a slanting line from the lawn to the stars. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) It's got to keep going up. 
Gatsby looks to the green light. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) She has to go to Tom and tell him she never loved him... I need to give her more time. I just need to give her more time... 
He turns to Nick, reassuring both of them. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) Don't worry old sport, don't worry. I can protect her here. Good night old sport... 
Gatsby heads for his castle, and turns and calls... 
GATSBY (CONT'D) You're wrong about the past, old sport...! 
Gatsby's POV: The green light across the bay. 
GATSBY (CONT'D) You're wrong. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SANITARIUM - DOCTOR'S OFFICE - EARLY SPRING - MORNING 
The first day of spring; out the window, birds chirp. 
Nick is writing and reading aloud... 
NICK (READS) There had been music from my neighbor's all summer. In his blue gardens, men and girls came and went like moths among the whisperings and the laughter and the stars... 
He struggles for a more poetic phrasing... 
NICK (CONT'D) Laughter... No... No... Among the whisperings and the champagne and the stars... (MORE) 
NICK (CONT'D) (that's the one) But after Tom and Daisy visit... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. GATSBY'S CASTLE - FRONT GATES - LATE AFTERNOON 
Gatsby's castle cuts a grave silhouette against a stormy sky. 
NICK (V.O.) There were no more parties... 
His lights flicker and go out. 
NICK (V.O.) Gatsby's lights went out one by one. 
At the gates flashbulbs flash! Hordes of press have gathered. 
NICK (V.O.) Daisy visited discreetly. But... 
As the gates creak open, Daisy's limo slides up the drive... 
FADE IN NEWSPAPER HEADLINES: "PARTY PALACE GOES DARK!" 
NICK (V.O.) The very same fame that had once been a source of satisfaction to Jay Gatsby, became... a threat. 
As the reporters crowd the limo, shouting questions...

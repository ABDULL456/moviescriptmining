{"train": "Rambling Rose - by Calder Willingham \nFADE IN: \nEXT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY \nOn a taxi arriving at the Delta terminal of Kennedy Airport. A man in a well-tailored gray suit gets out of the taxi. \nCUT TO a CLOSER SHOT of the man as he pays the cabbie. He is WILLCOX HILLYER, the middle-aged \"Buddy\" of this story and the observer through whose eyes it is seen. He has a dry, ironic, rather agreeable manner and he should seem like everyone's idea of a successful author, a slightly graying, trim, still-youthful-looking fifty. The CAMERA follows him as he walks into the terminal carrying a small travel bag. \nINT. DELTA TERMINAL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer at a counter getting his ticket processed. A little smile is on his face as he talks to a pretty airline girl. This character likes girls; his aloofness is modified, his face changes when he talks to them. The airline girl smiles back, she finds him attractive. We don't hear what they are saying, no dialogue on track -- it is obvious he is flirting with the girl in a mild way, but now a frown comes on his face and he turns his head as if slightly annoyed by something. \nCUT TO a POV shot of a tall, gaunt, almost totally bald man at the next ticket counter. The man is about sixty-five and looks like a half senile Great Dane. He is DAVE WILKIE, erstwhile husband of the heroine of this story. Age has not been at all kind to Dave; his face is lined with bitterness, he is a sour, angry, lonely man and now he is making a very unpleasant scene with a ticket girl and an airline representative, waving his ticket and gesticulating angrily. He wears an expensive, ill-fitting suit and a Texas-type hat. We don't hear his angry complaints, no dialogue is on the track. \nCUT BACK to a CLOSE SHOT of Willcox Hillyer as he stares with a frown at the man. It's as if he knows the man but can't place him. The airline ticket girl speaks to him and he turns back to her, his face softening as he answers her, obviously saying he'll carry his bag. He nods goodbye to the girl, turns and the CAMERA follows him as he walks some distance away and stops, looks back with another pensive frown at the tall, gaunt man at the next counter. \nCUT TO ANOTHER POV shot of Dave Wilkie, a longer shot than the first. The man is now arguing angrily with two airline representatives, still waving his ticket and shaking his head. We don't hear him. Lip-readers might pick up what he is saying: \"I'm supposed to be in first class, not tourist. What's the matter with this friggin' airline?\" \nCUT BACK TO Willcox Hillyer, a CLOSE SHOT of his face as he rubs his chin and frowns obviously struggling to remember the man. The CAMERA holds on him as he stares at the gaunt angry Dave, racking his brain. He shakes his head, he cannot place the man and yet he knows him. The CAMERA moves in closer on Willcox Hillyer's face as he stares in pensive puzzlement at this ghost from the past and now we hear, as if from a distance, FAINT MUSIC on the track -- it is \"Dixie,\" played with beautiful lazy mocking love by the great Louis Armstrong in his prime. At first we can barely hear it, then the MUSIC becomes LOUDER as Hillyer's frown deepens and he seems almost to know the man. \nMAIN TITLE (SUPERIMPOSED): \"RAMBLING ROSE\" \nThe MUSIC remains a bit in the distance, but it can be heard. \nOTHER TITLES (SUPERIMPOSED): over the following action. \nVARIOUS SHOTS, on Willcox Hillyer. He gives up his effort to recognize the strangely familiar Dave with a little shrug, turns and walks away with his travel bag. \nINT. DELTA TERMINAL - LOUNGE - DAY \nWe see him entering the departure lounge and boarding the plane. \nINT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY \nA shot of him as he smiles rather nicely at a very attractive young stewardess as he walks down the aisle of the plane. He is not a crass or lewd flirt, but life comes into his face when he sees a pretty girl -- he seems to have a real affection for girls: toward men he is polite but rather dry and ironic, almost aloof, but girls he likes. We see him sit in a seat, open his travel bag and take out long galley sheets. He stares for a moment rather wearily at the galleys, then sighs, puts on reading glasses and begins to make corrections as boarding passengers walk by in the aisle. \nSomething or someone disturbs him, he looks up with a slight frown and CUT TO a POV shot of Dave Wilkie, all wonder and enthusiasm. This OVER the TITLES and we do not hear the dialogue they speak, what we heard is LOUIS ARMSTRONG, but I will put the dialogue in here so the actors can act it. We do not want to hear it, the sense of what they are saying will be obvious from the acting. \nDAVE WILKIE (not on track) Buddd-dee! My God, if it ain't Buddy! Well, if this ain't the darnest thing! \nANOTHER ANGLE, on them both as Dave blocks the aisle, an idiot false-toothed grin on his face. Hillyer has a pained embarrassed smile. \nWILLCOX HILLYER (not on track) Excuse me... your voice is familiar and I'm sure I know you from somewhere... \nDAVE WILKIE (not on track, with delighted injury) Awww-rr, Buddy, come on, you know me! \nWILLCOX HILLYER (not on track) Well, I... I... ah-h, let's see... \nDAVE WILKIE (not on track) It's Dave Wilkie! I'm Dave Wilkie, don't you remember me? \nWILLCOX HILLYER (not on track) Oh. Oh, God. Of course, Dave, how are you? \nThe men shake hands, Dave enthusiastically, Hillyer less so. We see Dave stow his suitcase and take the seat next to Hillyer. \nEXT. KENNEDY - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of a big Delta jet making its final taxiing turn and ROARING into a take-off. \nINT. KENNEDY - DAY \nCUT TO a dramatic underbelly shot of the jet going up. \nEND OF TITLES. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY \nA shot of the attractive, young stewardess, harried as she fixes drinks. \nINT. DELTA AIRPLANE - DAY \nCUT TO Dave and Willcox Hillyer as the young stewardess gives them drinks. Dave bestows a sour glance on her when he sees the single drink, but at the moment he is in the midst of an aggressively self-satisfied conversation and says nothing to her. He speaks to Hillyer, who is making a real effort to be polite but is less than happy about the encounter. \nDAVE WILKIE Well, I am in the construction business, Buddy, and without braggin' I have done real good at it. (with a meaningful bitterness) There are those who wouldn't have expected that out of me. (pauses as if waiting for a reaction, but Hillyer is very silent) Right now I'm buildin' a giant motel unit near Alexandria, outside Washington, D.C. Not fi-nance, I'm on the construction side. \nWILLCOX HILLYER (making polite talk) Well, that's interesting, Dave. I always liked Washington, it's a pretty town. \nDAVE WILKIE Oh, it's all right, beats Jew York. But the niggers have took it over, just like every other city we got, only worse. \nHillyer gives a barely perceptible wince at this speech, but Dave doesn't notice, he goes on with aggressive self satisfaction after a swallow of whiskey. \nDAVE WILKIE Well, I tell you, I don't know what the world's come to these days. Things used to be better. We didn't have any money, but things were better. (grimaces in anger) Goddamn niggers and kikes burning the flag, rioting, raising hell -- they ought to shoot their asses off. I tell you, Buddy, where this country made its mistake was allowing people without property to vote. \nDuring this speech, Willcox Hillyer grits his teeth but says nothing. He keeps his eyes down on the galley sheets. As Dave shakes his head in sorrow at the state of the nation .. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ATLANTA TERMINAL - HERTZ COUNTER - DAY \nA shot of Willcox Hillyer at a Hertz Counter in the Atlanta airport. A tense, wrought up Dave Wilkie is in the b.g. of the shot. During the following brief exchange, Hillyer is politely cool, Wilkie under a great strain. \nDAVE WILKIE (holds out hand) Well, got to get a plane to Savannah. Great running into you, Buddy. Give my best to your Daddy. \nWILLCOX HILLYER Yeah, I'll do that, Dave. \nDAVE WILKIE (sweating, tense, under some kind of awful emotional strain) Ah-h, if you happen to run into Rose sometime... do me a favor, give her a message for me, will you? \nWILLCOX HILLYER (a trifle wearily) Dave, I haven't seen Rose for years. \nHillyer takes rental car papers from a pretty young HERTZ GIRL, gives the girl a little smile, picks up his travel bag. In desperation, Dave takes his arm. \nDAVE WILKIE Buddy, I'm a sick man. I had a heart attack last year, I wasn't expected to live. \nHillyer turns to Dave, puzzled and interested; Dave earnestly explains. \nDAVE WILKIE (CONT'D) You might see her. She writes your Daddy, and she and that doctor came to see him, didn't they? I wish you'd tell her something... I never could write letters. \nWILLCOX HILLYER (in a different tone, interested, curious) What do you want me to tell her, Dave? \nDAVE WILKIE (a painful inward struggle; the man is tormented, miserable) Oh, to hell with it, never mind. Don't tell her anything. Don't even tell her you saw me. (half turns his back, his face twisted with strong emotion) Got to run, Buddy, I'll miss my plane. \nWillcox Hillyer and the pretty young Hertz Girl stare after Dave Wilkie as he walks away with spasm-like steps. Hillyer seems affected, less hostile toward Dave now. He speaks half to himself, half to the Hertz Girl. \nWILLCOX HILLYER He still loves her. The poor damn fool still loves her. \nHERTZ GIRL Who was she? \nWILLCOX HILLYER A girl named Rose. (pulls himself back into the world of reality) Still take R75 to Glenville? \nHERTZ GIRL Yes, sir. \nWillcox nods thanks and walks away carrying his travel bag. \nEXT. ATLANTA AIRPORT - ROAD - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of the red Ford driving from the airport. \nEXT. INTERSTATE 75 - DAY \nA shot of the red Ford on Interstate 75, Atlanta skyline in b.g. \nEXT. GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY \nOn the red Ford as it speeds along a Georgia Interstate through red clay hills in green springtime. \nINT./EXT. CAR - GEORGIA INTERSTATE - DAY \nCUT TO a shot on Willcox Hillyer CLOSE ON his face in the car. He is lost in reflection. A look of bitter sweet emotion is on his face, an expression of sadness mixed with amusement. As the CAMERA holds on his face, we hear again on the track Louis Armstrong's great version of \"DIXIE,\" or music of comparable power, beauty and nostalgic evocation. Now the music is stronger, much stronger than behind the titles, we are beginning to hear it full force. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nBLURRED SCREEN FLASHBACK: \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - DAY \nA shot of a thirteen-year-old boy on the front porch of a house in the sleepy Depression South of many years ago. He is BUDDY, Willcox Hillyer as a boy. The MUSIC continues as he shades his eyes to look at something far away. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY \nCUT TO a LONG POV shot of a young and very pretty blonde girl walking slowly up an oak-shaded driveway. A ZOOMAR LENSE takes us TOWARD her. She is carrying a cardboard suitcase tied with a string. Her clothes are cheap, her shoes are dusty, runs are in her stockings. She is sweaty, tired and seems very nervous. ROSE is a very attractive girl, but her primary quality is not sexiness, but an innocence and sweetness. She pauses to wipe sweat from her forehead with the back of her hand and nervously moistens her lips as she stares ahead uncertainly at the \"nice\" Southern home which to her seems very grand. It is apparent she is badly frightened and apprehensive about what lies ahead. She is also exhausted from the heat and a long hot walk in the Southern sun. She blinks at perspiration, swallows in anxiety again and forces herself to walk on. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - PORCH \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy on the porch. Expressionless, unreadable, neither friendly nor hostile, he stares with an even gaze directly into the CAMERA. He has his hands on his hips in a distinctive way that we will later see is a mannerism of his father's. Buddy tries to imitate the style of his father, not always with complete success. Unreadable as a Sphinx, he stands there, waiting. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME PORCH - DAY \nCUT TO a POV shot of Rose at the foot of the porch steps. A tentative little smile is on her face. It is very plain she is nervous and frightened. \nROSE Hello. I'm Rose, and I've come to live with you and your family. \nSilence. The damn boy says nothing. A trifle crestfallen, Rose moistens his lips and swallows. She ventures another little smile and the CAMERA follows her as she walks up the steps. The at-times-insufferable Buddy comes into the shot. He still has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his expression is inscrutable, neither friendly nor hostile. \nROSE (CONT'D) What's your name? What do they call you? \nMOTHER Hotcha character. If I had to live with your cynicism, I wouldn't want to live at all. What you can't understand is that the creative forces of the universe are positive, not negative. \nDADDY (gently, his irony is mild) All right, darlin', don't go off into the fourth dimension. \nMOTHER I'm not in the fourth dimension -- (points a finger at him) -- you are in the fourth dimension, when you allow skepticism and doubt to take control. As Blake said, if God had doubt the sun would go out. \nDADDY (again gentle irony, always courtly toward her) Forgive my crudity, darlin'. I don't understand these deeper things the way you do. \nMOTHER (reaches up, takes his hand) Be nice to Rose. She's never had a real home. \nDADDY You're a wonderful woman, darlin'. As long as you're around, I'm sure the sun wouldn't dare go out. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll and Waski in the kitchen. Doll and Waski are playing parchesi on the kitchen table. Buddy turns from eavesdropping at the window and strolls across the kitchen, hands in his khaki pants. \nBUDDY It's pitiful. Neither one of them know. \nDOLL (as she shakes dice) I think Daddy suspects. \nBUDDY No, he doesn't. Not really. \nThe CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he goes to the hall door, carefully opens it to make no noise and peers down the hall. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY \nCUT TO a POV shot of Rose busy dusting hall furniture, humming as she works. We hear on the track the SOUND of the Model-A starting, and Rose freezes. Then, quickly, Rose hurries down the hall toward the front door. \nON Buddy as he watches her through a crack in the door. He has his hands on his hips Daddy-style and his face is expressionless. \nANOTHER ANGLE, POV of Buddy but CLOSER on Rose at the end of the hall. She is staring soulfully through the glass of the front door as we hear the Model-A go down the driveway. Rose lifts a hand between her breasts, sighs. A lovesick expression is on her face. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nON Buddy, as he comes back into the kitchen sadly shaking his head. \nBUDDY It's really pitiful. She's in bad shape. \nDOLL She's watching the car again? \nBUDDY Yeah. \nDOLL I get so irritated with Daddy. He's so dumb sometimes. \nWASKI Yeah, I know. \nBUDDY Oh, Waski, you don't know anything. \nWASKI I do, too! \nBUDDY All right, what do you know? \nWASKI Rose is madly in love with Daddy... \nDOLL (pauses, then solemnly) Well, don't tell Mother. \nWASKI Do you think I'm crazy? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nA shot of the family at dinner in the dining room at night. Daddy is at the head of the table, Mother is at the other end. \nBuddy, Doll and Waski are all seated in neat, nice clothes, hands washed and hair combed. Rose is serving, but a place is set for her. She wears an attractive little apron and is smiling, blushing, happy as Daddy teases and jokes at her. \nDADDY (in a good humor) Rosebaby Blossom, these are the most delicious candied yams I ever ate! Why, they just melt in my mouth. And this fried chicken is fit for a king. How do you do it, Peachbird? What is the secret of your art, Plum Blossom, huh? \nROSE (blushing, smiling) Oh, I don't know, I... I... \nDADDY Rosebird Baby, you are the light of my life, darlin'. How did we ever get by without you? \nROSE (stares at him, stricken) I... I'll get the grits. \nThe CAMERA FOLLOWS Rose as she exits, and STOPS on Buddy and Doll. Buddy slews his eyes toward his sister, who meets his gaze for a moment then looks down at her plate. The CAMERA MOVES on to Mother, who is utterly oblivious of anything going on between Rose and Daddy. \nMOTHER Rose does have a gift for cooking. She learns so fast, but mainly I think it's that she tries so hard. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT (LATER) \nANOTHER ANGLE, on the family as they eat dinner. Rose is seated at the table now. She is picking lifelessly at her food and glancing from time to time with a lovesick expression at Daddy, who is busy eating and seems wholly unaware of it. Mother also is wholly unaware, but all the children know what is happening. Rose takes a gravy for a biscuit and spills a little, her hand is trembling. \nMOTHER (gently, suspects absolutely nothing) Rose, you're in an awful dither tonight. What's the matter with you, honey, are you sick or something? \nBUDDY This is my place and you can't have it. \nDOLL (a whispered moan of frustration) Ohhh-hh... what's happening now? \nBUDDY (his eyes open wide) He's trying to get up -- good God, one of her titties is out! \nDOLL Let me see! \nINT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a POV shot of Daddy and Rose, as he struggles to rise from the chair. They are half falling to the floor and now they fall, Rose still on his lap. One of her breasts has come out of her dress, which is very loose and low-cut. She has no bra, the breast is bare. Daddy is staring groggily at the breast as if slightly dazed. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCUT BACK TO Buddy and Doll. Buddy is frustrated now. \nBUDDY Now I can't see. What are they doing? \nDOLL (happy, peeping through crack) Boy! Wow! \nBuddy groans and peers intently through crack. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nA POV shot of scene as observed by Buddy. He is up too high, the dining table blocks his view. We see the lower half of Rose and Daddy. Rose's skirt is up well above her knees. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll. \nDOLL Wow! Brrrother! \nBUDDY What are they doing? \nDOLL Buddy, this is amazing, you wouldn't believe it. \nBUDDY What are they doing, Doll? \nDOLL (staring, enthralled) He kissed her. \nBUDDY Is that all? \nDOLL (happily, enjoying it) He had his hand on her titty. \nBUDDY Let me look. (can't stand it, grabs her around waist and pulls her away; eagerly looks, sags) Aww-rr... \nCUT TO a POV shot of the scene in the dining room. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nDOWN LOW, we can see under the dining room table now. Daddy has his hands on Rose's shoulders and is firmly pushing her away. \nDADDY All right, that is enough of this nonsense, and I mean enough! Get up off this floor, Rose, and put your damned tit back in your dress! Do you hear me, girl, get up off of that floor! \nRose, on all fours, blonde hair over her face, making little whimpering noises of dismay: \nROSE Ohh-hhh... ohh... \nINT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO Buddy and Doll. \nBUDDY (disappointed) She's putting the titty back. \nDOLL (a furious whisper) Buddy, that was my place. \nDoll forces her way in and they both peep through crack in door. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a POV shot of Rose and Daddy. Rose stands sheepishly by the dining room table, half-crying as she adjusts her dress. Daddy sits in his dining room chair. Daddy is glaring at her. \nDADDY Goddamn you, girl! You've made me make a fool out of myself, damn your hide, but let me tell you I am standing at the pass of Thermopylae and I won't budge! The very idea, my own home with children in the house, to say nothing of my wife -- oh-h, you had better believe I am standing at Thermopylae, you little nut, you had better believe it! What are you, crazy? A man is supposed to be a fool like this, but a woman is supposed to have some control and sense! Are you a nitwit? What's the matter with you? \nROSE (weeping) Oh-h, I'm sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Hillyer... I just... couldn't help myself. I'm sorry... \nINT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they peep at the door. Doll whispers angrily at him. \nDOLL Buddy, that was pretty snotty of you, pushing me away like that just when it was interesting. \nBUDDY You shouldn't watch such things, Doll. \nANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed. Buddy has propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the moonlight -- we see the soft notch between her breasts in the open V of her thin nightgown. She is completely unself conscious with him. \nBUDDY (casually) Can I touch you here? \nBefore she can answer, he touches her breast with his finger through her nightgown. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft. \nROSE (casually, doesn't object) What did you expect? \nBUDDY Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe. \nROSE Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe. \nBUDDY (touches her breast more boldly, his hand outside the nightgown) There's some kind of gristle in it, though. \nROSE Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things. \nBUDDY Actually, I am, though. \nROSE (dreamily, thinking of Daddy as she smokes cigarette and stares up at the ceiling) You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next. \nBUDDY Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose? \nROSE No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me. \nBUDDY Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like? \nROSE (frowns) Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things. \nBUDDY But I'm curious, Rose. \nPuts his hand in her nightgown. \nROSE Buddy, get your hand offa me! Quit it, get you hand away... \nTakes his wrist. \nBUDDY Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm? \nROSE (gently) Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice. \nBUDDY Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like. \nROSE You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business. \nBUDDY Aw, be a good sport, Rose. (sweetly, almost sugarily) You like me, don't you? I like you a lot. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. We see Daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly out into space. Mother lies asleep in a big four poster in the background of the shot. Daddy sighs wearily to himself in the grip of \"insomnia in reverse.\" \nINT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT BACK to Buddy and Rose in bed. He has evidently sweet talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in her nightgown. There is no indication of lewd interest on Rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face. Buddy seems quite fascinated, however. \nROSE Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh? \nBUDDY Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right. \nROSE 'Course it does. \nBUDDY First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn. \nROSE (moistens her lips, swallows; it is affecting her; she frowns) All right, that's enough. (firmly pushes his hand away) You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk. \nBUDDY That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose. \nROSE (lighting cigarette) Don't mention it. \nBUDDY (pensively, with the solemn pedanticness of a precocious child) It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot. \nROSE Who would want to do such a thing as that? \nBUDDY Well, some fiend might. \nROSE (stares wonderingly at him) You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you. \nBUDDY There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose. \nROSE There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him. \nBUDDY Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you. \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy in the kitchen as he sits rather gloomily at the kitchen table drinking the glass Of milk. \nDADDY (to himself) Ehh-hh, Lord, man born of woman hath few days and they are full of trouble. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot close on Rose ai Buddy in the bed. The shot is of their heads and shoulders. She has an arm very tight around his shoulders and her eyes are shut tight. The moment of truth is at hand. \nROSE Ohh-hh! Ohhh-hh! (it's all over; she twists sideways, puts both arms around him) Oh, Buddy, you're so sweet. I love you a lot. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy as he washes out the glass in the sink. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy in the bed. The extremity of her crime has dawned on Rose and she is sitting up in the bed with a look of horror on her face. Buddy is staring worriedly at her. \nBUDDY Rose, are you all right? Are you sick or something? \nROSE (staring off in space, lost in horror) No. No, I'm all right. (turns, stares at him, puts a hand in woe on her forehead) Oh, God, what have I done? I have robbed a cradle and fallen into hell! (fumbles desperately on bed for cigarettes) I must be crazy, a child like you. Oh, God, oh, Lord. This is awful, this is terrible, I gotta get outta here! \nANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy as Rose in a panic gets out of the bed, pulls down her thin nightgown and tiptoes toward the door. She stops and looks back as a chilling thought occurs to her. \nROSE Buddy, you wouldn't tell nobody, would you? \nBUDDY (a trifle too piously) Don't worry, Rose, I won't tell a soul. \nROSE I sure hope you don't. (still in a panic) I gotta get outta here, good night. \nBUDDY (sweetly) Good night, Rose. \nINT. HILLYER SOME - UPSTAIRS HALL AND DOWNSTAIRS HALL \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in his bathrobe. The shot is down the staircase and Rose in the upstairs hall tiptoes into the picture. A floorboard creaks and he looks up and sees her. \nDADDY Rose, what are you doing up? \nROSE Nothin', just goin' to the bathroom. \nDADDY Is anything wrong? \nROSE No, sir. \nDADDY Well, good night. \nANOTHER ANGLE on Rose in the upstairs hall. Fortunately for her the light is dim. Her knees are shaking beneath the nightgown, she looks as if she might faint. \nROSE Good night. \nThe CAMERA FOLLOWS her as she goes on shaky legs down the hall. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Rose as she enters her small bedroom. Feebly, as if totally exhausted, she shuts the door behind her then leans against a bureau and states into its mirror. The horror of her own criminality has overwhelmed her. With trembling hands, she takes a cigarette from her half empty pack and finds a wooden kitchen match on the bureau. Her hands tremble visibly as she strikes the match. She has not turned on the light in her room and her considerable charms are very apparent in the orange glow of the match. Burning match in her fingers, she stares at her own reflection in the bureau mirror, transfixed by a horrible realization. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - DREAM - CELLAR \nQUICK DISSOLVE TO BLURRED SCREEN: the border of the screen is blurred, we are obviously seeing a nightmare fantasy. The shot is of an eager, excited, diabolically mischievous Buddy and an astonished, awed DOLL. They are in some far dark recess of the cellar of the house and the scene is furtive, murky, cobwebby. \nBUDDY Wait till you hear what happened! Now you wont believe this, Doll, but Rose came in my room and got in my bed last night... \nANOTHER ANGLE on Buddy from below with candlelight giving his child's face a sinister look. Now he has \"Dracula\" teeth and evil arched eyebrows. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) ... and she sweated and snorted like a horse and had a horrible fit, her eyebrows were all scrunched up and she groaned like she was eying and foamed at the mouth! \nINT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Rose standing horrified before the mirror. The match is still burning in her fingers. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nINT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM/STUDY \nA shot of Mother in her study, a worried Doll stands before her. The border of the screen is blurred, it is another flash of fantasy. \nMOTHER Yes, dear, what is it? \nDOLL Mother, Buddy says Rose got in his bed last night and he fiddled with her and she snorted and had a fit -- and he says I would too if I was grown-up. Is it true, Mother -- would I sweat and snort and froth at the mouth and have a horrible fit like he says? \nMother stares in consternation at Doll. \nQUICK CUT TO: \nAs she talks, Buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. A smiling Doll comes forward and hands Buddy half of an orange. He makes a face at her. Mother takes the bottle and pours out a tablespoon of castor oil. \nBUDDY (wanly) Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil? \nMOTHER This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this. \nBUDDY (he is resigned, there's no way out; he makes a face, swallows the castor oil) Geccch, yehh, guhhhh! \nMOTHER Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it. \nBUDDY Uhhh, gahdam stuff! \nMOTHER What did you say, Brother? \nBUDDY I said ahhh-dam stuff. \nMOTHER No, you didn't say that, Brother. \nBUDDY Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff. \nDOLL No, Mother, he's lying... \nBUDDY Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts \nWASKI (happily excited, stammering) He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook! \nBUDDY Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you! \nMOTHER Children, children! Be quiet, all of you! (the children at once simmer down) The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow? \nBUDDY She's getting herself up to go out. \nMOTHER (frowns, adjusts hearing aid) What'd you say, Brother? \nBUDDY She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now. \nMOTHER Oh, yes, it's Thursday. (glances around at sound of an opening door) Hello, Rose, dear... (her eyes open wide as she stares at Rose, disconcerted; now weakly) ... my, you're... looking pretty... \nCUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She is quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most remarkable thing of all. \nThe skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material. It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is on her face. \nROSE How do you like my outfit? I made most of it myself. \nRose walks in, \"modeling\" the outfit and the CAMERA PICKS UP Mother. \nMOTHER (smiling, slightly aghast) Well, it's... very gay. \nWe hear the SOUND of the Model A on the driveway. \nBUDDY Here comes Daddy. \nROSE (staring down admiringly at the outfit) I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook. \nMOTHER (makes up her mind to defend Rose) Well, I think it's charming, Rose. (tactfully) But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight? \nROSE Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging. \nWe hear the PORCH DOOR SLAM. Smiling, happy, Rose glances around. We hear the SOUND of the kitchen door opening. \nCUT TO a POV SHOT of Daddy in the kitchen doorway. As usual, he has a rolled-up Glenville Tribune in his hand and a Straw hat on the back of his head.His hands are on his hips and he is hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees. \nDADDY Ye gods and little fishes. What have you done to yourself, Rose? \nON THEM ALL. Rose is smiling, happy to be the center of attention. \nROSE Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all. \nDADDY Got yourself up? \nROSE Yeah. I'm goin' out. \nDaddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head. Sits at table. \nDADDY Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose. \nMOTHER Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful. \nROSE (smiles affectionately at Mother) You're so sweet. \nDADDY If you've got time before you go \"out,\" get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup. \nROSE Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens. \nMOTHER But that's a wonderful quality, not a bad quality. (takes his hand) Have a little patience with her. She's such a good-hearted little thing and tries so hard. \nDADDY (stares pensively at her) You are the one who's good-hearted. (rises) As for Rose, let's hope for the best. \nMOTHER (rises, again takes his hand) Be kind to her. She loves you so much. (Daddy stiffens slightly, and she adds) In a perfectly proper way, of course. \nDADDY Yes, of course. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Rose and Buddy waiting in a Model A. Rose is smiling, happy to be going out. The red rose is prominent in her hair, Daddy walks INTO THE SHOT, gets into the driver's seat of the car, He glances in a wry manner at the flower in her hair. \nDADDY What have you got in your hair, girl? \nROSE My rose. It's kind of like a motto. People will say, there comes Rose with her rose. \nDaddy gives her another wry stare and starts the Model A. \nCUT TO a shot of the Model A going down the driveway. \nEXT. MODEL A IN TOWN - DAY \nANOTHER SHOT or two of the Model A on the quiet summer streets of a sleepy little town in the Depression South of years ago. \nINT./EXT. MODEL A - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. Buddy is in the middle. Daddy is staring expressionlessly straight ahead. His tone is sternly neutral as he speaks. \nDADDY You were up late last night, Brother. \nBUDDY Well, a little. \nDADDY Reading dirty comic bocks. (glances shrewdly at him) And you admitted it? \nBUDDY (a trifle uncomfortable) Well, yeah. \nBoth Rose and Buddy begin to look increasingly tense. Hawkshaw the Detective is on the scent. Daddy stares ahead. \nDADDY You were up late last night, too, Rose. \nROSE (meekly) Yes, sir. I had to go to the bathroom. \nA long pause, as Daddy stares ahead. His expression is inscrutable. \nDADDY (finally, \"casually\") Sometimes I think I was born to be a detective. I get a feeling about things. I'm not always right, but often I am. \nEXT. MODEL A BY LIGHT - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of the Model A as it stops for a red light. \nINT./EXT. MODEL A - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. Daddy turns and stares sternly at Buddy. \nDADDY Son, was Rose in your room last night? \nBUDDY (scared, but a good liar) No. Why should Rose be in my room? \nDaddy sternly scans them both. They stare back \"innocently\" at him. Finally he seems to accept it. \nDADDY I can't imagine why. It was just a thought. \nDaddy shifts gears and faces front. Buddy glances upward in relief, as if to say, \"Wow, that was close.\" \nDADDY (CONT'D) Where do you want me to let you out, Rose? \nROSE Oh, anywhere downtown. \nDADDY You don't know where you're going? \nROSE Oh, I'll just mosey around here and there. \nEXT. MODEL A - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of the Model A as it stops off the main street of a small sleepy Southern town. \nINT./EXT. MODEL A - DAY \nCUT TO a shot through the side window on Rose, Buddy and Daddy. \nDADDY Is this ill right? \nROSE It'll do just fine. (gets out of car) Bye-bye, see you later. \nSlowly shaking his head, Daddy starts the car. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nA shot of Rose and the Young Salesman as they walk along. She is holding his arm and they are smiling and talking as if the best of friends. We hear MUSIC ON THE TRACK. The MUSIC continues over the following MONTAGE OF SHOTS. \nINT. HONKY TONK - VARIOUS SHOTS \nON Rose in a beer \"honky tonk\" with the Young Salesman in a booth. He is drinking beer, she is drinking Coca Cola from a bottle. \nON Rose in the booth, ANOTHER ANGLE. A second man has joined them, a big beefy man -- he is BUSTER. \nEXT. STREET - LATE AFTERNOON \nON Rose as she walks down a sidewalk in late afternoon with Buster and still another man, a tall fellow in a Coca-Cola Delivery Man's uniform or shirt. Rose seems to be innocently happy, but the men appear to be having a mild dispute. \nON Rose getting into Busters car as Buster holds the door for her, smiling. The COCA-COLA DELIVERY MAN is left on the sidewalk, disappointed. \nINT./EXT. BUSTER'S CAR - DUSK \nCUT TO a shot of Rose in the car eating barbecue with Buster. She is talking animatedly and he seems enchanted with her. It is dusk. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of a car pulling up in the driveway of the Hillyer house. Rose gets out, waves goodbye to Buster. It is night. End MUSIC. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy in pajamas peering out of the bedroom window. \nDADDY Well, she's back. \nMOTHER (O.S.) What time is it? \nDADDY Quarter of twelve. \nMOTHER (O.S.) Is she all right? \nDADDY I don't see any bruises or broken bones. \nCUT TO a shot of Mother in bed in the four poster. \nMOTHER Bruises and broken bones, what kind of thing is that to say? \nDaddy walks INTO THE SHOT, sits on the edge of the bed. \nMOTHER (CONT'D) Why shouldn't she go out and have boyfriends? \nDADDY No reason at all, darlin'. \nMOTHER Well, I wish you'd stop criticizing and picking on her. \nDADDY Forgive my crudity, darlin'. All I'm saying is that a girl who would wear clothes like that is going to get in trouble sooner or later. \nMOTHER (doubtfully) Well, time will tell, won't it? \nDADDY Yes, darlin', time will tell. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY \nA SHOT of Mother on the patio studying. It is a sunny afternoon. Mother looks up idly, looks back down at her notebook, then looks up again with a frown. \nCUT TO A POV SHOT of a SCRUFFY-LOOKING KAN as he darts behind one tree to another. The Scruffy-looking Man does not seem sinister, but he definitely is scruffy. \nON Mother. Frowning, she puts down her notebook and rises, walks toward the door of the kitchen. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Rose washing dishes in the kitchen. As usual, she is in a cheerful good humor. We see Buddy at the kitchen table building a model airplane. Mother comes INTO THE SHOT, worried, frowning. \nMOTHER Rose, that scruffy-looking man is out in the yard again. \nROSE (her smile fades) Mrs. Hillyer, I don't know who he is, I really don't. \nMOTHER I had better call Daddy. \nINT. HOTEL - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy behind the desk of a slightly run-down small hotel of the Depression era. He is handing a key to a guest. \nDADDY Glad to have you with us, Mr. Watson. Make yourself at home. Shadrach, take Mr. Watson's bag. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - DAY \nON mother, peering worriedly through the curtains of the front door. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nA SHOT of the family at dinner at night. Daddy, Mother, Rose, Buddy, Doll and Waski. The SHOT FAVORS Mother. \nMOTHER That sulky boy was here again this afternoon. I was almost scared, he wouldn't go away. \nDADDY (throws his napkin on table) Rose, my patience is wearing thin. First a scruffy man who runs like a deer and now a sulky boy who wont go away. This is getting to be a regular monkey and dog show. \nROSE I swear to God I don't know who in the world he is. Really, I don't, I don't know no boy like that, I don't. \nSlowly, his face grim, Daddy returns his napkin to his lap and resumes eating. The children are very silent and look a trifle scared. \nMOTHER (finally, in a small voice) Well, it isn't Rose's fault boys and men like her. You cant blame her for that, hon. \nDADDY Rose, I realize you don't know this boy, but if you know anybody who does know him, if you have even a faint clue as to who he might be, then convey to him that he had better stay away from my house and stop scaring my wife... and I don't mean maybe. \nINT. HILLYER SOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy in his room at night. He is dressed and at a study table listening with cheap earphones to a homemade crystal radio set. Enter a rather somber-faced Doll in her nightgown. \nBUDDY (listening) Chattanooga. I had St. Louis, Missouri. \nDOLL Buddy, I'm worried about Rose. \nBUDDY So am I. \nDOLL She hasn't got any sense. In some ways, she's awful dumb. \nBUDDY (takes off earphones, gives it a moment of grave consideration, then his opinion) It isn't that she hasn't got any sense, Doll. Her basic intelligence is probably above average, maybe quite a bit above average. \nDOLL Then why does she act so dumb? \nBUDDY Dumbness doesn't concern her, Doll. And neither does smartness. You see \nBuddy is interrupted by the SOUND of the distant angry shout of a man's voice, evidently from somewhere outside in the woods because Buddy and Doll turn at once toward the window. In shock they listen. \nFIRST MAN'S VOICE You son of a bitch, what are you doing here?! \nSECOND MAN'S VOICE I'd like to ask you the same question, you bastard! \nFIRST MAN'S VOICE I told you to stay away from her, goddamn you! \nSECOND MAN'S VOICE You got no right to tell me to stay away from her, I knew her before you did! \nBUDDY Oh, boy. Oh, boy, oh boy. Daddy isn't going to like this. \nFIRST MAN'S VOICE She told you to leave her alone, didn't she? \nSECOND MAN'S VOICE Like hell she did! You're the one she wants to get shed of! \nBUDDY Come on! \nHe and Doll hurry from the room. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS HALL AND STAIRS - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll running down the upstairs hall and down the stairs. The CAM M FOLLOWS them down the stairs. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - BACK HALL - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy and Doll as they slow down and creep cautiously down the back hall to the back porch. We hear the men yelling somewhere out in the dark bushes. \nFIRST MAN'S VOICE You'll swallow teeth yourself if you don't leave her alone, you ugly bastard! Go on, throw one, throw one! \nSECOND MAN'S VOICE I'll throw one, you son of a bitch! \nWe hear a great CRASHING in the bushes, a SMACK of a fist, a GROAN of shock, an OATH, a SHOUT, more CRASHING. \nEXT. BACK PORCH - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot from the POV of the children, on Daddy on the back porch as the lights blaze on. He wears his bathrobe and has a big shotgun in his hands. Now he speaks in a loud, clear and very angry voice. \nDADDY All right, I have got a Parker shotgun here and it is loaded and the trigger is cocked and wherever you birds are and whatever you are doing you had better get the hell out of here goddamned quick! \nA sudden total silence ensues, then a sudden CRASHING in the bushes as the \"birds\" take off. \nDADDY (CONT'D) And do not come back, you sons of bitches! Stay away from my house and home and my wife and children or I'll blow your goddamned heads off! \nCUT TO a shot of the Model A as it turns onto the Hillyer driveway. \nINT./EXT. MODEL A \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the car. She tries again. \nROSE I didn't mean to bite him. He was hitting Horton with a blackjack in the meanest way and... and I bit him accidental. \nDADDY (stops the car, turns to Rose) I have to go back to the hotel. I'm on duty at the desk and who knows a quest might arrive. I will see you at suppertime, Rose. \nROSE (a feeble smile) I didn't mean to bite him, I really didn't. \nDADDY I will see you at suppertime, Rose. \nROSE (feebly) Yes, air. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STEPS - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of a shaky, slumped Rose going up the steps with Buddy as the Model A drives away. Rose is coughing, looks miserable. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nA SHOT of Buddy and Doll in the living room of the Hillyer home at night. Doll is half-heartedly practicing scales on the piano and Buddy is pacing the floor, hands clasped behind him in something like the style of his father. As the CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy in his pacing we see Waski playing with marbles on the floor. \nDOLL (turns around on piano stool, to Buddy) What is Rose going to do? Where can she go? \nBUDDY They've been in there the longest kind of time. I can't stand it, I gotta find out what's going on. \nDOLL You better not snoop, Daddy'll kill you! \nINT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy coming with great furtiveness from the living room out into the front hall. Very cautiously, he tiptoes across the hall and bows down and listens at the door of his mother's bedroom-study. He crouches down, peeps through the keyhole. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM/STUDY - NIGHT \nCUT TO a \"keyhole shot\" of Daddy and Mother in the bedroom. Mother sits in her study chair, a handkerchief to her eyes. Daddy sits in a chair nearby. He looks depressed. \nDADDY I'm sorry, darlin', I hate it as much as you do. \nMOTHER (wanly) Well, she does seem to cause a lot of trouble, I admit. But she doesn't mean any harm and it'll break the children's hearts, they all love her. \nDADDY It's because of the children she's got to go. I don't want to be holier-than-thou, but the girl doesn't have the same outlook we do. Morals don't mean a thing to her, not a thing, and we can't have a girl like that in this house. \nMOTHER Who is to say our morals are better than hers? (frowns, sighs) But maybe you're right. She could... influence Dolly... \nDADDY That is exactly what I'm afraid of. (pauses, and firmly) The girl has got to go, darlin'. \nMOTHER But morals come from the heart, not from rigid rules and empty laws. And in her heart Rose has never hurt anyone and she never would. Therefore, she's not immoral. Not really. \nDADDY Now look, darlin', this is no time to go off into the fourth dimension. \nMOTHER But what I said is the simple truth. And now I see something else, I see more deeply into it... \nMother has a slightly \"other-worldly\" look on her face. Daddy glances at the door of the bedroom, he suspects something. \nDADDY Just a moment, darlin'. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy crouched at the keyhole. With great alacrity, he jumps up and hurries across the hall and shuts the living room door just as Daddy whisks open the bedroom door. Daddy grimaces. \nDADDY Could of sworn that boy was out here. \nDaddy shuts the door and at once almost like the movement of a ballet Buddy opens the living room door and tiptoes back to the keyhole. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a Shot of Daddy and Mother. It is another \"keyhole shot.\" \nMOTHER How could Rose really be a bad influence on Dolly? She has a loving nature, you ought to want someone like that around your children. Why do you think those boys and men like her? \nDADDY Well, I have a pretty good idea. \nMOTHER If you mean sex, you couldn't be more wrong. Rose likes those boys and men, she has love in her heart, and that is what they want. It's the most rare and beautiful thing in life and that is why they follow her. \nDADDY They follow her because she's a -- (he is about to say \"piece of tail,\" but interrupts himself) -- no, I won't say that. \nMOTHER What she doesn't understand is that her behavior is disturbing to other people. She's young, she's got to learn to restrain the life force that's in her. Its creative, but in her case it's too creative. \nDADDY Darlin', Rose has got to go! \nDADDY (icily polite) Excuse me, sir, are you calling my wife a liar? \nMOTHER (embarrassed) Honey, please... \nDR. MARTINSON (a thin unpleasant smile) It's simply that I find it incredible, Mr. Hillyer. Aside from the girl's illness at the moment, she is very strong, a very healthy specimen of a young human female -- and a comely one, too. She must have gotten protein somewhere as a young child, if only sporadically. \nMOTHER It is kind of amazing. The dentist says she has perfect teeth, there isn't a cavity in her mouth. \nMR. MARTINSON (tries to make a supercilious joke) Her entire mouth is a cavity, Madam, ha ha ha. \nDADDY (dryly, doesn't like the man a bit) Ha ha ha ha. \nMother frowns at Daddy and Dr. Martinson gives him an aloof glance. \nDR. MARTINSON (with spurious dignity) The point is you don't grow up like that on a diet of sorghum and hominy grits. She got protein somewhere, she's a very strong girl and I think she'll live... despite the delay in medical treatment. \nDADDY That's all I want to know. (rises) Lets get out of here before I get the epizootics myself. Thank you, Doctor, for your discourse, it was fascinating, no doubt. \nMOTHER Yes, thank you, Doctor. \nDR. MARTINSON (as they leave) I beg your pardon, epi-zoo-tics? Do you mean \"epi-zoo-ot-tics,\" an animal epidemic? \nDADDY (icily polite, from the door) No, I mean epizootics. \nINT. HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Mother, Daddy, Buddy, Doll and Waski as Daddy comes out of the Doctor's office and shuts the door. \nDADDY I can't stand that polecat. They ought to hang him. \nMOTHER You don't like him because he's a Yankee. He's a brilliant doctor. \nDADDY He's a polecat, dear. \nINT. HOSPITAL ELEVATOR - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy, Mother and the Hillyer children in a hospital elevator as a black elevator operator runs them down. Daddy has his hat politely removed and is staring pensively ahead. \nDADDY Rosebud looked pretty pitiful in that bed. (sighs, shakes his head) I hope she'll be all right, but I still think we ought to fire her. \nMOTHER I don't see how you can even think of it now. \nDaddy purses his lips but says nothing. It is obvious the \"epizootics\" have saved Rose, at least for the time being. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA SHOT of Rose in bed in her own bedroom. She is propped up on pillows and wearing a rather attractive pink silk housecoat of Mother's. A tray is on her lap and she is eating her supper as Buddy sits on the edge of the bed talking with her, or rather listening to her. It is obvious she is well on the road back to health. \nROSE Oh, he's so kind, so gentle inside, and so unhappy with that rich wife who doesn't understand him, her being a Southerner and everything, and what a bedside manner he has got -- so gentle and kind beneath the professor way he acts! \nBUDDY Rose, you are too uncritical of people. \nROSE You don't know the bedside manner that man has got. Why, it does me good just to see him sit there all solemn and go pokin' in his bag like he's gonna cure me, which he did of course. And even more important he loves me, like a patient I mean, the other day he got tears in his eyes just listenin' to my heart beat. \nBUDDY He did? \nROSE Yeah, he tried to hide it but I saw 'em, and a little bit he says to me, \"You know, you are beautiful.\" Now wasn't that a nice thing for a doctor to say to a patient, wasn't it? What could cheer a girl up more? \nBUDDY Rose, I have got doubts about that doctor and so does Daddy. \nROSE He's got doubts about hisself and that's the saddest thing of all. Would you believe that poor man thinks nobody likes him? \nBUDDY Yeah, I'd believe it. \nROSE Well, I like him. I used to be afraid of doctors but not any more. Why, he could operate on me any old time and I wouldn't even be scared. \nBUDDY Rose, you are just entirely too uncritical of people. \nROSE I ain't neither. Listen here, Buddy, besides all his vast medical knowledge, he has the most kindest heart beneath the professor way he acts -- he wants justice in the world and he's got some real interestin' ideas. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Mother opening the front door. Dr. Martinson is there-with his black bag, an icy polite look on his face.; \nMOTHER Oh, good evening, Doctor. Rose is a lot better, I just gave her her supper. She's almost all well now. \nDR. MARTINSON Let me be the judge of that, Madam. \nMOTHER Yes. Well. She's upstairs. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAY/NIGHT \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nA SHOT of Daddy, Mother, Rose, and the children all in their Sunday best going up the steps of a church. Rose looks virginal in the modest dress Mother made for her. \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nA SHOT of Rose, Mother, Daddy and the children on a bench in church. We hear singing. Rose looks innocent, virginal as she sings. Mother gives her an approving look, exchanges glances with Daddy. \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of the Hillyer family coming out of church. We see them shaking hands with the Minister. Rose smiles sweetly, modestly. \nEXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of the Model A driving up in the driveway of the Hillyer house. \nANOTHER ANGLE on them all as they get out of the car. Rose takes Doll's hand with one hand and Waski's hand with the other. \nROSE All right, we'll play monopoly then. \nMother, Daddy and Buddy watch Rose go up the steps with Doll and Waski. \nMOTHER She's like a different person. Being so sick made a big impression on her. I really think she's learned a lesson. \nDADDY Um-hmm. (waits as Mother goes on up steps, then turns to Buddy and in a low tone) Come with me, Brother. I want to show you something. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE GARDEN - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in a rose garden below the windows of the house. \nIt is Hawkshaw the Detective and his Unwilling Assistant. Daddy solemnly points to dim marks in the flower bed. \nDADDY See that, son? Now this is a heel, see, and there, that's the ball of a foot. Someone has been walking here. \nBUDDY (reluctantly) Well, it's not very plain. \nDADDY That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand? \nBUDDY But how would you find him? \nDADDY Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder? \nBUDDY Well, I don't know. (trying to sound like a fellow detective, but doesn't want Rose to get caught) No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it. \nDADDY True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with. \nINT. GARAGE - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy back in the garage. They are scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the garage. All Daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead ringer for Sherlock Holmes. He is in dead earnest about this, it is no Joke and he does not dream of being funny. \nDADDY (points to ladder, eyes narrowed) See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder. \nBUDDY Well... maybe... \nDADDY And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night! I am going to chain up this ladder and padlock it! -- and that is not all I am going to do! \nBuddy stares at him in apprehension. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nA shot of the whole family at dinner including Rose. Daddy puts down his napkin. \nDADDY That was a delicious repast, Rose, as usual. Now I have something of grave import to say to you and to Mrs. Hillyer. (pauses, points at Buddy) And I don't want you children snooping, do you hear me, Brother? Go up to your rooms. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - UPSTAIRS - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy, Doll and Waski in the upstairs. They tiptoe along furtively. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - STAIRCASE - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of the children going down backstairs. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - CELLAR - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy leading Doll and Waski down the steps of the cellar. The CAMERA follows as they walk past an ancient coal-burning furnace and... \nINT. HILLYER HOME - CRAWL SPACE - NIGHT \nclimb up into 'a crawl space beneath the front of the house. \nDADDY (offhand; he is thinking hard about what to do) She already told you, she doesn't know. \nMOTHER (naively) But she must know... unless... unless... Rose, was there more than one person? \nROSE (weeping in handkerchief) Oh-h, Mrs. Hillyer, I... I can't think. I... I'm not really sure. \nMOTHER (gently, a tiny frown, a bit shocked) Rose, really, you shouldn't act like that. \nROSE (weeping) Oh, I know. But I didn't, really. Honestly, I didn't. There was only one, but he's out of town and leave no forwardin' address. \nDADDY (a brilliant idea) Ah, ha! Hold the phone! No forwarding address, huh? (turns to Mother) In the shock of this brilliant move, I forgot something. \nMOTHER What did you forget? \nDADDY I forgot that Rose will lie like a child. She's no more pregnant than I am, she just doesn't want to go to that farm! \nROSE Yes, I am. \nDADDY No, you're not. \nROSE Yes, Mr. Hillyer, I am. \nDADDY (triumphant, sure he's right) All right, tell us, Rose, what makes you think you're pregnant? \nROSE (simply) I haven't had my period for three months and my stomach is getting big. \nDADDY (again \"poleaxed\" for a moment, but pulls himself together) I don't believe it. \nROSE It's so, Mr. Hillyer. \nDADDY All right, damn it. We've seen you with your clothes off around here, stand up and pull up your dress and let's take a look! \nMOTHER Honey! \nDADDY She doesn't have to take her panties off, we can see her stomach with 'em on. All she has to do is pull up her dress and let us see her belly. \nROSE Well, all right, if you just won't believe me. \nRose stands up. \nMOTHER Rose, you don't have to. \nROSE I don't mind. \nDADDY Now, you will see, she's lying like she always does -- that belly will be flat as a pancake! \nRose lifts her dress and Daddy leans forward eagerly to confirm his belief. Rose stands there with her skirt lifted. She has on a pair of skimpy white panties. An unmistakable, definite protrusion can be seen in the area below her navel just above the line of her panties. A stupefied look is on Daddy's face. \nMOTHER I'd say about three months. Are you satisfied? \nDADDY I am poleaxed and in a non compos mentis condition. I wash my hands or the whole thing. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Doll walking up onto the patio with schoolbooks. The CAMERA follows her as she walks over to Buddy, who is crouched down eavesdropping at another window. She whispers to him. \nDOLL What's goin' on? \nBUDDY Rose says she's goin' to have a baby and she sure looks it, but I don't think so. \nDOLL A baby... and she isn't even married. \nBUDDY That's the least of her troubles. Rose had a rare tropic disease and the little tubes in her that babies swim down are all stopped up, she told me all about it. \nDOLL If it isn't a baby... what is it? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DR. MARTINSON'S HOME OFFICE WAITING ROOM - NIGHT \nA shot of Buddy and Rose in a rather elegant Doctor's waiting room. It is night and they are alone on a small sofa. Buddy has a very solemn and worried look. Rose lies weeping in terror on his shoulder. \nROSE Oh, Buddy, they're gonna cut me all up! They're gonna cut my stummick all open, I'll die! \nBUDDY (trying to be brave) You won't die, Rose. \nROSE Buddy, I'm scared, I'm scared! \nINT. DR. MARTINSON'S SOME OFFICE - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Dr. Martinson's private office in his home, quite a bit more luxurious than his office at the hospital. A sober-looking Mother and Daddy sit talking to him. He almost seems to relish the situation. \nDR. MARTINSON I'm not surprised you thought she was pregnant. An ovarian cyst can look very much like pregnancy. But it was pure wishful thinking on her part. The girl can never have children, she had gonorrhea at fifteen and it was untreated. \nMOTHER (CONT'D) I thought I knew you. I thought I knew you better, I thought in your heart you were a good and kind man. Well, I can't believe what I've just heard in this room. A defenseless girl depending on you for protection, and you propose to mutilate and destroy her. How could you listen even for a moment to that sadistic man? \nDADDY (slightly shattered) Well, now, darlin'... give me a chance to defend myself. \nMOTHER I can't believe you really meant it, if I did I'd want to die. You aren't a male monster, that man is but you aren't. Look me in the eye and tell me, do you really want to take Rose's womanhood away from her when it's all she has got? \nDADDY Well, I... I hadn't thought about it that much. I was thinking... well, it's an idea, the girl is oversexed, and... \nMOTHER Rose isn't oversexed, that's ridiculous. If you're going to talk nonsense, I don't want to talk to you at all. Rose is exactly the same as the rest of us, except more so. \nDADDY Well, I know, more so. That's why I was thinking... maybe she'd be better off. \nMOTHER (with a quiet fury) Better off? How could she ever find love and happiness, if you did what you're talking about? Are you insane? \nDR. MARTINSON (rather feebly) Now, may I say, I am against that particular procedure, as a general rule. But in a case of near nymphomania, it doesn't seem monstrous to me at all, but medically advisable. \nBoth Mother and Daddy totally ignore him. Mother's eyes are fixed on Daddy and he is struggling with himself, staring down at the floor. \nDADDY Well, now, I admit... in Rose's case, it would be cruel. If Rose wasn't attractive and pretty... well, it would probably be bad for almost any young woman. I don't know exactly what I was thinking about, the doctor said it and it sounded reasonable. \nDaddy finally looks up at Mother and admits his error like a man. \nDADDY (CONT'D) But you're right, darlin', you're absolutely dead right, it would be an awful and horrible thing to do. I'm sorry, honey, forgive me, I didn't mean it. \nMother turns from Daddy and walks up to the desk and stares down at Dr. Martinson as if he is a loathesome bug upon which she intends to step. \nMOTHER I will not cry like a woman. If I'm upset it's because of what my husband said, not because of you. You can't make me cry like a woman, a woman has got just as much intelligence and self-control as a man. And you get this in your head. If you hurt that girl, I'll hire lawyers and sue you for malpractice for every penny you have got, I'll do my level best to ruin you. Do you understand me? \nDR. MARTINSON (a sickly smile, he is licked totally) Yes, I understand you, but you have misunderstood me completely. \nMOTHER (icy cold) I understand you perfectly. You leave that girl alone, you wretched man, or you will be sorry. \nDR. MARTINSON (a foolish smile, as if Mother has paid him some kind of compliment) Actually of course I won't operate, I don't do major surgery. Dr. Hardy will operate and of course he'll be guided by your wishes in this respect. \nMOTHER Let him be guided not by my wishes and not by Rose's wishes, although I am sure they are identical. Let him be guided by the wishes of the creative power of life itself, because that is what has spoken through me tonight. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STREET BY HOSPITAL - DAY \nA shot of the Model A parked on the street outside a hospital in a small Southern town. We see Daddy slowly pacing back and forth in front of the hospital entrance, his head bowed and his hands clasped behind him. \nANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSER on the Model A. Buddy sits in the middle on the front seat, Mother is at the window. Doll and Waski are on the back seat. They all are staring with pale worry at the pacing Daddy fifty feet away. All are frightened, Mother is very pale. Doll has a tiny handkerchief to her eyes and is half crying. Even Waski is very scared. \nWASKI (seems on verge of tears) Mother... is Rose going to die? \nMOTHER (in a trembly voice) No, Waski, she won't die, because we are praying for her. \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy from the POV of the car. He looks at his wristwatch, frowns and walks into the entrance of the hospital. \nANOTHER ANGLE, on them all in the car. They wait, pale and silent. Doll sniffles in her handkerchief. \nDOLL Why is it taking so long? \nBUDDY Here comes Daddy. \nCUT TO a POV shot of Daddy as he slowly walks up to the car, his straw hat in his hand. \nCUT TO a shot of Mother CLOSE on her face as she stares at her husband as if trying to read the news on his face. A tiny frown comes on her forehead as icy fear comes in her eyes. \nANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Daddy as he walks up to the window of the car, hat in hand. A trace of tears can be seen in his eyes, but when he speaks his voice is calm. \nDADDY (philosophically) Well, I thought I'd seen the limit, but these are the most great, gaga epizootics she's ever had. \nANOTHER ANGLE on Daddy and them all. In pale fear, mother stares at him, uncertain what has happened. \nMOTHER How is she? \nDADDY Fine. \nAs mother sighs in heartfelt relief... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nA shot of Daddy sitting with mother at the kitchen table. \nBright cheerful sunshine comes in the window that opens on the patio. Rose comes into the SHOT carrying a coffee pot, a sunny smile on her face. \nDADDY You're looking very chipper this morning, Rose. Sow do you feel? \nROSE Perfect, wonderful, good as I ever felt! Except for a big old scar on my stummick, I wouldn't even know I been in the hospital. \nBUDDY I heard you talking. Hasn't Rose come in? \nDADDY No, she hasn't. (frowns, looks around) I think I hear a car. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY \nCUT TO a shot of a 1930's automobile in the Hillyer driveway at night as it drives up and stops before the front steps. \nANOTHER ANGLE, CLOSE on Rose and Dave Wilkie in the car. Here DAVE is much YOUNGER, of course, and a rather handsome man in a stolid way. Even though he is younger than when we saw him on the plane, he is quite a bit older than Rose. Rose's eyes are opened wide, she is a bit breathless, obviously something important has happened. Dave stares at her as if fascinated, almost as if awed. \nDAVE (rather stiffly) I want to thank you for a wonderful afternoon and evenin'. Can I see you in the mornin'? \nROSE (a bit breathless) Yes. Year you can, you sure can. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy peering out of the window of the living room. \nDADDY Why, that looks like Dave Wilkie, \nMOTHER Who? \nDADDY You know Dave, his wife used to do dressmaking for you before she died. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT STEPS - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Rose on the steps. Happy as a clam, she turns and waves at Dave in the car, then goes on up the steps. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of the front hall as Rose comes through the front door. She is very excited, happy. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThe CAMERA follows her as she goes into the living room with her big news. \nROSE You'll never guess what happened! (pauses, then dramatically) I have met Mr. Right! I been with him all day and he loves me, I know he does, he loves me and he's going to marry met Be's practi'cly ast me already! \nMOTHER Well... well, that's wonderful, Rose. \nROSE And who do you suppose he is? That policeman who arrested me, the one I bit! He is Mr. Right! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CHURCH - DAY \nVARIOUS SHOTS of a wedding in a tiny country church. We see shots of Rose in a white wedding dress, smiling, happy. Dave is stiff and solemn in his best suit. Daddy gravely gives Rose away. We hear no dialogue here, MUSIC on track. We see Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski in the front row, all in Sunday best and very solemn. We see a CLOSE SHOT of Rose's knees trembling beneath her white wedding dress as a country minister marries them. VARIOUS SHOTS of a rather idyllic country wedding in a very plain, unpretentious country church, and... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nA shot of Rose, Dave, Buddy, Doll and Waski at a picnic celebration outside the church by a running brook. \nThe scene should be beautiful in summertime. We see a barbecue pit, homemade ice cream in the metal can, other picnic things. A happy Rose is kissing first Buddy, then Doll, then Waski. Dave smiles fondly, but rather stiffly at her. \nROSE And now Waski, are you and Buddy and Dolly ready for some ice cream, huh? Do you like picnics or don't you? \nWASKI We like 'em! We love 'em! \nDAVE Well, it isn't a picnic, honey. It's a barbecue. \nROSE (a little smile) Okay. \nDAVE A picnic doesn't involve roast meat, hon. At a barbecue you have a lot of roast meat. \nCUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy as he stares pensively at Dave. The CAMERA stays on him as we hear VOICES OVER. Rose is happy, Dave phlegmatic. \nROSE (V.O.) Well, all I know is there's ice cream. And I'm gonna have me a plate right now! \nDAVE (V.O.) Better wait, hon. It'll spoil your appetite. Have some barbecue first. \nThe CAMERA stays on Buddy, as he stares pensively at Dave. He has no expression on his face at all. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CHURCH - DAY \nA shot of Rose and Dave bidding goodbye to the Hillyers. Daddy, Mother, Buddy, Doll and Waski are in the model A. Rose is obviously on the verge of tears as Dave speaks solemnly to Daddy. \nDAVE Well, we are off to Savannah, Mr. Hillyer. No more police work, I'm getting in the construction field. \nDADDY Good luck, Dave. And good luck to you, too, Rosebud. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nHe looks around. No one is there. He glances at a modern refrigerator that is in pretty poor shape, glances with a frown at dishes in the sink unwashed. He goes on out to the patio. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy putting out seed for birds on a table on the patio. Daddy now is a very old man, but his personality and style are the same as ever. He looks up with a stern frown as Willcox Hillyer comes out on the patio. \nDADDY Well, you rascal, where'd you come from? \nWILLCOX HILLYER Hello, Daddy. How are you? \nDADDY About as good as can be expected with one foot in the grave. Good to see you, son. (they shake hands) Did you bring any of that Yankee whisky with you? \nWILLCOX HILLYER It isn't Yankee whisky, Daddy, it's Scotch. \nDADDY It's Yankee whisky to me. \nDaddy takes him by the arm, leads him back into the kitchen. \nDADDY (CONT'D) How do you stand it up there, boy, in all that ice and snow? What are you, a polar bear? \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as they enter the kitchen. The former opens his travel bag and takes out a bottle of Teacher's. \nWILLCOX HILLYER I can use a drink after the plane ride I had. \nDADDY Your wife and children are back in New Hampshire in the snow? \nWILLCOX HILLYER (a little smile; it is summer, there couldn't be snow in New Hampshire) Yeah, they're in the snow. \nWillcox opens whisky, looks for glasses in the dusty familiar cupboard. \nDADDY Are they polar bears, too? \nWILLCOX HILLYER (frowns at cupboard) Good God, the way you live here. This place hasn't been dusted since Mother died. Look at that goddamned refrigerator. \nDADDY Got another twenty years in it, boy. (something seems to be bothering him) By the way, son, do you recall Rose, that pretty blonde girl who came to our house way back in 1935 or 1936 and caused such a damnable commotion. \nWILLCOX HILLYER (frowns, turns and stares at him) Of course I recall Rose. In fact I've been thinking of no one else for the last hour and a half. \nDADDY How could that be, son? \nWILLCOX HILLYER Dave Wilkie of all people was sitting by me on the plane -- her first husband. It's funny you would mention Rose. Did you hear from her? \nWillcox pours out whisky. \nDADDY (casually) Well, yes, in a manner of speaking. You'll have the back bedroom, son, Mother's old art room. Just be careful going down the stairs you don't break your Yankee neck. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Willcox Hillyer and Daddy as they walk with their drinks out to the patio. \nWILLCOX HILLYER What's all this about Rose? What do you mean, you heard from her in a manner of speaking? \nDADDY Oh, I heard from her, I got a letter from her, she's fine. But there is some sad news. \nWILLCOX HILLYER What sad news? Did her cancer come back? \nDADDY Oh, no, no, she got all over that. Rose is fine. Let's sit down, son. \nWILLCOX HILLYER Is her husband sick or something? \nDADDY No, it's another thing. I was going to write you about it, but since you were coming down anyway I thought I'd wait till you got here. What did Dave Wilkie have to say? \nANOTHER ANGLE on Willcox Hillyer and the aged Daddy as they sit on the patio sipping whisky. Willcox Hillyer is not disturbed or worried about Rose, Daddy has been very casual and offhand about it and he has no inkling of what the news really is. \nWILLCOX HILLYER The pitiful son of a bitch said Rose was a nymphomaniac. \nDADDY Um-hmm, and I suppose that incensed you? \nWILLCOX HILLYER You're damn right it incensed me, the miserable bastard. He also said the kikes and the niggers have taken over Washington. D.C. \nDADDY (nods somberly) Yeah, I know, he was up here. It's pitiful like you say. When he lost Rose it ruined the man, it destroyed him totally when he lost Rose. \nWILLCOX HILLYER He didn't lose her, he threw her away. \nDADDY Yes, I guess he did. He threw her away and it was the mistake of his life. \nWILLCOX HILLYER (staring off pensively into space) You know, I don't know this town any more. All this traffic, new buildings, prosperity... (pauses, almost as if in pain) Where have the years gone, Daddy? Where is the little town I knew as a boy? \nDADDY At rest in the creative universe with Mother, son. \n", "test1_input": "Daddy pauses, then in a different tone, his hidden gentleness and kindness are much more plain; as he talks Rose's eyes begin to well with tears. \nDADDY Now, I know you've had some troubles in your life, those... scoundrels in Birmingham and so forth trying to... lead you astray. I hope you find a safe haven here, honey, I know you've had a hard time. Life can be cruel to a young girl all alone. We welcome you to our home, Rosebud, we all welcome you from the heart and hope you are happy here. \nRose bites her lip, her eyes are filled with tears; an inaudible whisper. \nROSE Yes, sir. \nINT. HILLYER HOME \nVARIOUS SHOTS of Rose doing household chores: sweeping the floor, vacuuming, cooking. She is cheerful in her work, smiling, good-humored and she works hard. It is obvious she is happy. We see the children in most of these shots. It is apparent Rose is a very good worker and very happy in her new home. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nRose is washing the dishes while the children finish breakfast. Buddy looks up from this cornflakes with a slightly sly expression. \nBUDDY Rose, who were those scoundrels in Birmingham? \nROSE Nobody. \nBUDDY But who were they? \nROSE They were just bad men, that's all. \nBUDDY In what sense were they bad? \nROSE Bad is bad, Buddy. There ain't no sense to it. \nBUDDY Did they try to induce you to become a prostitute? \nRose turns around, lifts her eyebrows, tosses down the dishcloth. \nROSE I don't answer talk like that, Buddy. I just don't hear it, I turn my back and look away. \nRose turns her back on him. \nBUDDY Was that what they tried to do? Was that why Daddy gave you the job, to save you from those scoundrels? \nROSE Your Daddy is a wonderful man, I'll say that. He's the best and most kind-hearted man in the world. \nBUDDY Hey, Rose, did you hear about that terrible thing down in Cave Springs? \nROSE What terrible thing in Cave Springs? \nBUDDY There was this old man that ate his niece. \nRose stares emptily for a moment, then bites her lips together. \nROSE I didn't hear you. I didn't hear that. \nBUDDY He really did, he ate his little niece. He made pork chops out of her. \nROSE I don't hear you. I just turn my back on that kind of talk and look away. \nBUDDY Well, it's only the truth. There are horrible things in the world, Rose. \nROSE Buddy, you are in one of your evil moods, I don't want to talk to you. I'm going out and sweep the patio. \nRose exits and the CAMERA stays on Buddy, Doll and Waski. \nBUDDY Rose is almost as sentimental as Mother. If there's one thing I can't stand it's sentimentality. In Chattanooga this man committed an almost perfect murder. He killed his wife with a black widow spider. \nDOLL Oh, shut up, Buddy. \nWASKI Yeah, shut up. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Rose on the stone patio of the Hillyer house, an attractive area with outdoor furniture and crabapple tree limbs overhead. Rose is busy sweeping. The CAMERA PANS to follow her and we pick up Mrs. Hillyer, Mother. It is a nice day and she is studying out on the patio, books and notebooks piled around. Rose glances down curiously at her. \nROSE What are you studying now, Mrs. Hillyer? \nMOTHER More history, Rose. \nROSE Are you going to get your degree soon? \nMOTHER Well, I am working on my thesis. \nROSE (as she busily sweeps) It must be wonderful to be so smart. I don't see how you do it, reading all those books, learning all that stuff. \nMOTHER (looks up, and gently) Rose, you work too hard. Why don't you go sit down somewhere and drink a Co-Cola? \nROSE (smiles, trusts and knows Mother now, not at all afraid of her) You're so sweet. \n", "test1_true": "MOTHER Really, why don't you go sit down somewhere? \nROSE I like to work. I don't mind work. It's the least I can do after all you and Mr. Hillyer have done for me. (stares worshipfully at Mother) You're so sweet. There never was nobody like you. \nMOTHER (gently) Well, you run on now. \nROSE Yes, Ma'am. \nExit Rose. Mother adjusts her notebook and turns the page of a history book as she resumes her studies. We hear the sound of an approaching CAR and she glances up. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of a slightly worn-out 1932 Model-A Ford as it rolls up the driveway of the Hillyer home, Daddy at the wheel. \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY \nANOTHER ANGLE, on Daddy as he gets out of the Model-A. He has his usual straw hat on the back of his head. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he walks onto the patio. \nDADDY Good morning, sweetheart. Beautiful day. \nMOTHER Yes, it's so nice I thought I'd work outside. \nDADDY How goes it, darlin'? \nMOTHER Slow, hon. But at least I can concentrate now that Rose is here. \nDADDY What do you think of her, honey? \nMother doesn't answer, she writes on, head bowed over her notebook. We see in this shot the hearing aid she wears and hear from it a faint BUZZ. \nDADDY (CONT'D) Turn up your hearing aid. \nMOTHER What? \nDADDY Your hearing aid, it's buzzing at me like a snake. \nMOTHER (adjusts hearing aid) Oh. Did you say something? \nDADDY I asked you what you think of Rosebud, now that she's been here a while. \nMOTHER Honey, she's perfect. She works all the time and she's wonderful with the children. And they love her, even Brother likes her though he won't admit it. I think she's just perfect. \nDADDY Um-hmm. Almost too perfect. \nMOTHER And she's such a good-hearted thing, there isn't an ounce of harm or malice in her. \nDADDY Well, I'll admit I don't see any flies on her yet. \nMOTHER There are no flies on Rose, I don't know what you're talking about. \nDADDY Well, she must have done something to encourage those scoundrels in Birmingham, even if she did run away from them. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy in the window of the kitchen. He is propped on his elbows and listening with keen interest to the talk on the patio. We hear the VOICES of his parents OVER the shot. \nMOTHER'S VOICE If you mean... boys and men, I don't think so. Rose seems very calm about all of that. \nDADDY'S VOICE Well, so far I have to agree. She seems calm as lettuce. \nThe CAMERA FOLLOWS Buddy as he draws back into the kitchen. We see Doll and Waski playing a game on the kitchen table. \nBUDDY Daddy says Rose is calm as lettuce. Do you believe that, Doll? \nDOLL No. \nWASKI Neither do I. \nBUDDY Oh, Waski, you don't even know what we're talking about. \nWASKI I do, too. \nBuddy turns, looks back out the window. \nEXT. HILLYER SOME - PATIO - DAY \nCUT TO Mother and Daddy on the patio. Daddy stands up. \nDADDY Well, let's hope for the best, darlin'. \nMOTHER Hope for the best? I don't understand all this skepticism. I thought you liked Rose. \nDADDY I love Rosebud, I am wild about Rosebud. I just hope she doesn't turn out to be a hidden hotcha character, that's all. We have growing children in the house. \n", "test1_id": 966, "test2_input": "MOTHER (simmers down at once, now calmly) Well, that's very reasonable. Howe I hate to bring it up, but she's got an awful toothache, we've got to carry her to the dentist. \nROSE I don't want to go to the dentist. \nMOTHER Be quiet, Rose. \nDADDY Darlin', I'll take a taxi to the hotel. You and Brother can handle the girl's epizootics. I'll just say one more thing. (turns to Rose and, in a grave tone) Rose, I told you you had a friend in Mrs. Hillyer, didn't I, that she would fight for you like a tiger? \nROSE (meekly) Yes, sir. \nDADDY All right, thanks to her, and thanks to this case of epizootics, you are getting another chance. (points a finger at her, and sternly) But don't try my patience again. We have growing children in this house. Do you understand me? \nROSE Yes, sir. \nINT. DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Mother, Rose and Buddy in a dentist's waiting room. Rose is holding a rubber ice bag to her jaw, which is quite swollen. She is groaning and half weeping in pain. \nMOTHER Poor thing. Does the ice help, Rose? \nROSE Ohh-hh, a little. Oh-h, I ain't never been to no dentist before. He's gonna kill me, I just know it. \nMOTHER No, Rose, he'll help you. \nANOTHER ANGLE, Rose shrinks in fear as, enter the dentist in a white coat, DR. WINTON, a kindly-looking, gray-haired man. We see a nurse behind him. He smiles in a reassuring manner. \nDR. WINTON Nurse says we have a nervous patient. Now, young lady, be calm. First of all, let me tell you, I am not going to hurt you. \nROSE Yes, you are. \nDR. WINTON No, I am not. \nROSE Look, you can't kid me. \nMOTHER (rises, takes her by the hand) Now, come on, Rose. Stop being so childish, come on. \nINT. DENTIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Mother and Dr. Winton, as they guide and lead Rose into the dentist's operating room.- She plants her feet and her eyes open wide with horror as she sees the chair and other equipment. \nROSE I'm not goin' in there, I don't like the looks of it! \nMOTHER (annoyed) Rose, sit down in that chair and be quiet! We're trying to help you, you silly creature, sit in that chair! \nROSE (very reluctantly sits in chair) Oh-hh, ohh-hh, Lord, he's gonna kill me. \nDR. WINTON You and the boy wait outside. \nINT. DENTIST'S WAITING ROOM - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Mother and Buddy in the waiting room. Enter Dr. Winton with a little frown. \nDR. WINTON Well, she finally let me look in her mouth. Is it true she's never been to a dentist? \nMOTHER She was raised on a poor dirt farm. I'm sure she's never seen a dentist or hardly even a doctor. \nDR. WINTON Well, she has one mouth in ten thousand, I don't see teeth like that once in ten years. Her trouble is an impacted wisdom tooth, but there isn't a cavity in her head, not a single one. She has perfect teeth. \nMOTHER But the wisdom tooth will have to be pulled? \nDR. WINTON Yes, and it's very bad. It probably should be done at the hospital under general anesthesia. \nMOTHER That would scare her to death. She's terrified of hospitals. To her, a hospital is where you go to die. \nDR. WINTON I think you're right, it would be harder on her. But you'd better call Mr. Hillyer, she's going to need help to get home. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.

HILLYER PATIO - DAY \nA shot of Mother and Daddy and Buddy on the patio. It is a beautiful sunny morning. Mother and Daddy are seated at an outdoor table about to have coffee. Daddy is opening mail and Buddy, in the b.g., is gluing up a kite. Enter a smiling and healthy Rose with orange juice, toast, cups and coffee on a tray. \nDADDY Good morning, Rose. And how do you feel today? \nROSE Wonderful. Except I can touch the place back there with my tongue, I wouldn't even know I had that tooth pulled. \nDADDY (dryly, as he looks at mail) Well, I know it, I just got the bill for it. \nROSE Boy, for four or five days there I didn't think I'd live. But I'm my old self again! \nDADDY Umm. Well. Yes. But no more strange voices in the night, Rose. \nROSE Oh, no, sir. \nMOTHER Rose has learned her lesson, haven't you, Rose? \nROSE Yes, ma'am. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOTEL - MEZZANINE - DAY \nA shot of Daddy peering down at an old pool table in the mezzanine of the family hotel. Buddy stands by with a pool stick in hand. In the b.g., we see a black bellboy, SHADRACH, approaching. \nDADDY I see my mother-in-law's face, son. Read 'em and weep, boy, I am playing a spectacular combination, a triple. The nine ball in the corner! (takes his stance with cue as Shadrach walks up) Read 'em and weep, boy, that's all she wrote. \nSHADRACH Mistah Hillyer, the Chief of Police wants you on the telephone. \nDADDY (about to make his shot, looks around) The Chief of Police? \nSHADRACH Yassuh. \nDaddy straightens up, sets his jaw, leans the cue against the table and marches toward the elevator as Buddy stares after him. The CAMERA STAYS on Buddy. \nINT. HOTEL - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy going down the hotel stairs. He holds onto the banister, sliding with his hands far ahead in order to take four and even five steps at a time -- it is a childish trick, the point of the game is to touch as few stairs as possible. \nANOTHER ANGLE, on Buddy as he jumps down the last remaining five steps and walks into the lobby. Daddy comes from behind the desk, grim. \nDADDY Rose is in jail. She bit a policeman's thumb. Come on, son, Shadrach can run the hotel. \nEXT. MODEL-A - STREET - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy in the Model-A. Daddy stares grimly ahead. Buddy steals a worried glance at him. \nINT. LOCAL JAIL - DAY \nCUT TO a shot in the local jail. The shot is on Daddy as he stands before jail bars staring sternly into a cell. His hands are on his hips, his straw hat is on the back of his head and a bit to one side. Buddy stands beside him, a little bit behind, a worried look on his face. The CHIEF OF POLICE, a fat man, is on the other side of Daddy. \nCUT TO a POV shot of Rose in the cell. Her hair is mussed, her dress is torn. A little innocent, frightened smile is on her face. The CAMERA PANS to include Daddy and the Chief of Police. \nCHIEF OF POLICE That was a awful brawl down at the Busy Beaver, Mr. Hillyer. You know that fat Horton, the bootlegger? \nDADDY Yes, I know the son of a bitch. \nCHIEF OF POLICE Son of a bitch is right, he dern near killed a man. And this girl was the cause of it all. What's more, she bit a police officer's thumb right to the bone. \nDADDY Well, Rose, what have you got to say for yourself? \nROSE (coughs, then feebly) I got an awful bad cold. \nDADDY (nods slowly, then with aloof politeness) That's all you've got to say, you've got a bad cold? \nROSE (coughs again) Well, I don't know what happened. They were arguin' about baseball, then all of 'em started fightin'. As for that policeman, I didn't bite him, I don't think I bit him. \nIn dour silence, Daddy and the Chief of Police stare at Rose. She gives them a little smile, as if to say, \"See how innocent I am?\" The Chief turns to Daddy and asks with dry irony: \nCHIEF OF POLICE Well, she's your girl, Mr. Hillyer. You want me to release her in your custody? \nDADDY No, not really. But I guess we'll have to do that, John. Let her out. Let the crazy creature out and I'll take her home. \nINT./EXT. MODEL-A - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy, Rose and Buddy in the Model A. Daddy stares grimly ahead, silent. Buddy looks solemn. Rose is badly frightened and still coughing. Finally she ventures a little smile and speaks to Daddy. \nROSE I got an awful cold, I think I'm sick. \nDaddy is silent, his eyes fixed ahead. \nEXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY \n", "test2_id": 967, "test3_input": "CUT TO a POV shot of the garden below as seen by Daddy from the window. We see lying on the ground BILLY, the Sulky Boy who scared Mother. He wears only undershorts and is groaning, holding his leg, which evidently he has injured in jumping from the window. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - ROSE'S BEDROOM - DAWN \nOn Daddy, as he turns from the window to Rose. \nDADDY And who, Rose, may I ask, is that? \nROSE Well, it's Billy. \nDADDY And what, may I ask, was Billy doing here? \nROSE (a straight answer) Well, Mr. Hillyer, Billy's very poor, he don't have no money and there wasn't no place else to go. \nDADDY Well, it was a silly question. \nROSE He's a nice boy, you'd like him. He wants to be a fireman. \nDADDY Ye gods and little fishes, a fireman. Put on some clothes, Rose, you're naked as a jay bird. When you're dressed, come on downstairs. I'm afraid your friend Billy is injured, where are his clothes? \nROSE (begins weeping, both breasts now are exposed) Under the mattress. I hid 'em so you wouldn't be mad. He wants to marry me, he loves me. I can't marry him, he's too young and hasn't got no job, but he loves me... now you wouldn't hurt him, would you? \nDaddy gently pulls the sheet around her to cover her breasts. \nDADDY I won't hurt him, honey. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nA shot of Daddy, Mother and Rose at the kitchen table drinking coffee in the early morning. Daddy looks grave, Mother looks sad, and Rose is crying into a handkerchief. \nROSE Mr. Hillyer, I know it was bad and I hadn't ought to of done it. But I'm only a human girl and I... I ain't always perfect. I promise I won't let him in the house no more, I promise. Won't you and Mrs. Hillyer forgive me? \nDADDY Rose, darlin', you break my heart. But I am only a human man myself of the father variety. Rose, pack your bag, baby, as of this moment you are hired, mired and fired. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HILLYER HOME - DINING ROOM - DAY \nA shot of the family at breakfast in the dining room. The dissolve suggests that some time has gone by. Daddy looks a bit grim, Rose has a wan and depressed expression. Mother looks worried. \nDADDY (politely) Well, Rose, going out to look for a job today? \nROSE (eyes down) What's the use, there ain't none. \nDADDY Mmm. Would you get me another half a-cup of coffee, dear? \nRose rises and he watches her leave, then turns to Mother. \nDADDY (CONT'D) It has been three weeks since I \"fired\" her. Is there no way to get rid of this girl? Are we stuck with her for life? \nMOTHER She can't get a job, it's a depression. And we can't just throw her out on the street. \nDADDY The hell we can't. \nRose returns with coffee and pours it out for Daddy. \nMOTHER Rose, you don't look well and you haven't eaten a bit of breakfast. \nROSE I'm not hungry. I can't eat nothin', I haven't been able to eat since I got fired. I think maybe I'm sick. \nDADDY God forbid. You're not sick, Rose, forget it. Don't get any notions in your head, you're not sick. \nROSE Yes, sir. \nMOTHER She does look a little peaky. \nDADDY No, she doesn't, she's fine, fine. She's perfectly healthy, don't give her ideas. \nROSE Well, I'll do the dishes, then I'm goin' to lie down a minute and rest. My stomach hurts. \nDaddy watches Rose exit to the kitchen, then leans forward and speaks to Mother, his expression a bit sly. \nDADDY Her plan is obvious, plain as day. She's going on a hunger strike. The question is, how do we foil her? \nMOTHER She's just nervous and worried. And you would be, too, if you had no job and no place to go. \nDADDY (thinking hard) Something has got to be done or Rose is going to be in this house forever. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - DRIVEWAY AND PATIO - DAY \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO a shot of Daddy getting out of the car. He has a triumphant little smile on his face. \nA shot of Daddy as he walks onto the patio, a rolled-up copy of the Glenville Tribune in his hand and his straw hat on the back of his head. He definitely has a triumphant expression. Buddy on the patio notices it. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of the kitchen on Mother and Rose. Mother is helping a rather wan Rose prepare dinner. Enter Daddy. \nDADDY (as if everyone will be pleased) Well, I have got news! I called long distance and spoke to Cousin Hop and you'll be glad to know, Rose, I have found you a job! \nROSE Tennessee? \nDADDY Yes, Tennessee, a lovely state! \nROSE Well. What kinda job is it? \nDADDY Ahh-hh, you'll like it. It's a fine, outdoor-type job. \nROSE You mean a farm? \nDADDY No, no, not exactly. It isn't a farm in the sense that it's a farm. Not at all. It's a... dairy establishment. You'll 1ike it! I'm sure you'll like it because it's so... peaceful! \nRose bows her head and begins crying. \nMOTHER Honey, Rose was born on a farm and has terrible memories of farm life. Now I don't think -- \nDADDY Just a minute, Rose, you don't understand. This isn't a dirt farm like the one you were born on, it's nice. A neighbor of Cousin Hop's, I talked to him on the phone, a fine man... it's not a farm, damn it, it's a beautiful dairy establishment! Stop crying, Rose! Do you hear me? Stop crying, it's ideal! \nMOTHER I don't know how you can call it ideal -- don't you know what the word \"farm\" means to her? \nDADDY I don't give a hoot in hell's hollow what it means to her! She can't stay in this house forever! I fired her, damn it! \nMOTHER It sounds like a farm to me. Calling it a dairy establishment, that's just trickery and flummery. \nDADDY Trickery and flummery or not, she's going there tomorrow on the bus! It's settled! And I must say we've been more than fair to you, Rose, it's pretty selfish and mean hearted of you to sit there and cry like that! \nRose sits head bowed at the kitchen table. \nROSE I'm not cryin' because of me, I'm cryin' because of somebody else. \nDADDY (stops in mid-air, so to speak) What? \nEXT. HILLYER HOME - PATIO - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Buddy outside on the patio, listening intently at the window. He leans forward with a keen interest, eyes wide. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN \nCUT TO a shot CLOSE on Daddy. He is peering intently at Rose. \nDADDY What did you say, Rose? \nCLOSE ON Rose, as she turns, weeping. \nROSE Well, I was born on a farm myself... and I hate to think of the baby being born on one. \nOn them all. Daddy and Mother stare in shock at Rose. \nDADDY What baby? What baby? What baby are you speaking about? \nROSE Mine. \nDADDY Your baby? \nROSE Yes, mine. I'm going to have one. \nDADDY (he is \"poleaxed,\" staggered) Good God almighty. This is a catastrophe, they won't hire her. \nMOTHER (looks up, sees Buddy in patio window) Brother, get out of that window! \nBuddy ducks down out of eight instantly. Both Mother and Daddy, however, are too preoccupied and upset to be concerned with him. \nDADDY (stares off groggily into space) This is a total catastrastroke. As of this moment I am stumped, I admit, I am stumped and treed both, the hound dogs have me surrounded. \nMOTHER (as Rose begins crying) Poor thing, don't cry, Rose. I know you feel awful, but don't cry, honey, nobody's perfect. Who's the father, dear? \nROSE Well, I... I... I don't know... maybe it was... but no, you can't be sure about a thing like that. It wasn't Billy, I didn't know him. \nMOTHER (gently) I know it's embarrassing... but who were you exposed to, dear? ROSE Well, now, Mrs. Hillyer, I... ah-h, that's kinda hard to say. \nDADDY You're not going to get anywhere with that line of questioning. The problem is, what are we going to do? \nMOTHER That's why I'm asking her who the father is. It's the most vital question of all. Who's the father, dear? \n", "test3_id": 968}

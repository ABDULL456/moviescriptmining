{"test1_input": "ANOTHER ANGLE, on Rose and Buddy in the bed. Buddy has propped on an elbow and is staring down at her breasts in the moonlight -- we see the soft notch between her breasts in the open V of her thin nightgown. She is completely unself conscious with him. \nBUDDY (casually) Can I touch you here? \nBefore she can answer, he touches her breast with his finger through her nightgown. \nBUDDY (CONT'D) Hmmm, it's soft. It's awful soft. \nROSE (casually, doesn't object) What did you expect? \nBUDDY Well, I thought they were more like a cantaloupe. \nROSE Ha ha ha, that's some idea, a cantaloupe. \nBUDDY (touches her breast more boldly, his hand outside the nightgown) There's some kind of gristle in it, though. \nROSE Buddy, quit that, you're just a child, you're not supposed to be interested in such things. \nBUDDY Actually, I am, though. \nROSE (dreamily, thinking of Daddy as she smokes cigarette and stares up at the ceiling) You know, that Daddy of yours is the funniest man, the things he says, you never know what's going to come out of his mouth next. \nBUDDY Can I put my hand inside your nightgown, Rose? \nROSE No, you can't. And I'll tell you this -- he scares me. As kind as he is, he scares me. You can't fool around with him, not with that man. And, boy, I sure better not try nothin' like that with him again, he'll fire me. \nBUDDY Rose, can't I see what the nipple on it is like? \nROSE (frowns) Buddy, what's come over you? A child like you, askin' such things. \nBUDDY But I'm curious, Rose. \nPuts his hand in her nightgown. \nROSE Buddy, get your hand offa me! Quit it, get you hand away... \nTakes his wrist. \nBUDDY Just for a second. Please, Rose, what's the harm? \nROSE (gently) Buddy, you don't realize it but what you're doing isn't nice. \nBUDDY Aw, come on, Rose, I want to see what the nipple on it is like. \nROSE You don' t need to know that. It's none of your business. \nBUDDY Aw, be a good sport, Rose. (sweetly, almost sugarily) You like me, don't you? I like you a lot. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Mother's bedroom-study in the moonlight. We see Daddy lying wide-awake in a single bed staring broodingly out into space. Mother lies asleep in a big four poster in the background of the shot. Daddy sighs wearily to himself in the grip of \"insomnia in reverse.\" \nINT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT BACK to Buddy and Rose in bed. He has evidently sweet talked her into letting him fiddle with her; his hand is- in her nightgown. There is no indication of lewd interest on Rose's part, a peeved and exasperated look is on her face. Buddy seems quite fascinated, however. \nROSE Well, are you satisfied now? Can we just lie and talk, huh? \nBUDDY Hmmph. It has a nipple, all right. \nROSE 'Course it does. \nBUDDY First I couldn't feel it, but now I feel it easily, it's like a little acorn. \nROSE (moistens her lips, swallows; it is affecting her; she frowns) All right, that's enough. (firmly pushes his hand away) You're just a child and wouldn't understand it, but that type of thing can stir a girl up. Now lie back and we'll talk. \nBUDDY That was very interesting. Thank you, Rose. \nROSE (lighting cigarette) Don't mention it. \nBUDDY (pensively, with the solemn pedanticness of a precocious child) It was softer'n I thought, that was my main impression. You know, if you hit a girl there it would hurt her a lot. \nROSE Who would want to do such a thing as that? \nBUDDY Well, some fiend might. \nROSE (stares wonderingly at him) You know, Buddy, sometimes I can't figure you out at all. You can be very nice, but like your mother said there's an evil streak in you. \nBUDDY There's an evil streak in everybody, Rose. \nROSE There ain't none in your Daddy. You know, what happened has just made me love him all the more. I not only love him, I respect him, I admire him. \nBUDDY Rose, I have a serious favor to ask you. \n", "test1_true": "BUDDY (trying to be casual) Rose, since you're here in bed with me and everything and I've already touched your titty... \nCan't quite say it; leans over and whispers in her ear and we don't hear what he says. \nROSE (her eyes open wide as he whispers) Why, Buddy, shut your mouth! What an awful thing to say, and where did you get any such idea as that, anyhow? \nBUDDY I'm curious to see what it's like. I'm very curious, Rose. \nROSE Well, now that is just too bad! Curiosity killed the cat. \nBUDDY Yeah, but satisfaction brought him back. Can I? \nROSE No! You ought to be ashamed of yourself astin' such a nasty things a child your age! \nBUDDY Can't I touch it a little, Rose -- not a lot, just a little? \nROSE Of course you can't! I'm... I'm shocked at you, Buddy, real shocked! Now you be quiet or I'm going back to my own bed! \nBUDDY Please, Rose. I'm curious, that's all, I have a natural curiosity, it's only human. You're my friend, aren't you? Don't you like me? (again sweetly, almost sugarily) I like you, Rose, a lot -- in fact, I love you. \nROSE (softens despite herself) Well, you're sweet, but you don't really love me. \nBUDDY Yes, I do. Please, Rose, be a good sport. \nROSE Buddy, you're just a child. \nBUDDY I'm thirteen. And I have a natural curiosity. It's only nature, Rose, that's all. Now what's wrong with nature, huh? \nROSE Well, nothin'. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy sitting on the edge of his bed in pajamas. He looks frowzle-haired and glum. The CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he wearily gets up and walks across the bedroom in the moonlight and takes a package of cigarettes from a bureau. Be glances over his shoulder as we hear Mother. \nMOTHER What's the matter, hon? Is anything wrong? \nDADDY No, darlin'. Just that damnable insomnia in reverse. I sleep like a baby for an hour then I'm wide awake. You go back to sleep. \nDaddy lights a cigarette and walks to the window and stares out at the moonlit night. \nThe CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSER on his face and we see a weariness and strain he has not shown before. \nDADDY The Depression has got me. That miserable hotel, no money anywhere, strong men out of work, children hungry. It's a great life if you don't weaken. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HILLYER HOME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA shot close on Rose and Buddy in bed. Evidently Rose has weakened and is allowing him to fiddle with her, but we can only surmise this, the shot is on their heads and shoulders and a cloud has crossed the moon, the light is more dim. A different look is on her face, a solemn expression as if she is listening to some far away sound that she finds strangely haunting. She moistens her lips, speaks in a slightly feeble voice. \nROSE You better quit that. \nBUDDY But Rose... \nROSE I must be outta my mind. Buddy, quit it. \nBUDDY Am I hurting you? \nROSE (pauses, stares off as if listening, then in an even feebler tone, a half whisper) No. No, you're not hurting me. (moistens her lips, swallows) But I think you better quit it. \nBUDDY But why, if I'm not hurting you? \nROSE You wouldn't understand. (puts a hand on his shoulder as if to push him away, but can't; puts her other hand over her eyes) Oh, God, I must be outta my mind. What would your Momma think? \nThe hand falls limply from Rose's eyes and she turns her head to the side and closes her eyes. Helplessly, she lies there as the boy fiddles with her. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - FRONT HALL - NIGHT \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy walking down the downstairs hall in a bathrobe and slippers. He looks very frowzled and sleepy. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nON Daddy as he walks into the kitchen, turns on the light. He goes to the ice box, an old-fashioned type made of wood that takes cakes of ice. Be pours out a glass of milk. \nINT. HILLYER ROME - BUDDY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCUT TO a very CLOSE SHOT on Rose's face. The light is dim but we see perspiration on her forehead. Her breathing is not normal. Her eyes are shut tight, her teeth are clenched. \nCUT TO a shot CLOSE on Buddy. We do not see what he is doing, but evidently he is fiddling with her. He seems quite interested in the proceedings. \nBUDDY Rose, beyond a doubt this is the most fascinating experience of my life. \nINT. HILLYER HOME - KITCHEN - NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 966, "test2_input": "As she talks, Buddy reluctantly gets a bottle of castor oil and a tablespoon from a shelf and brings it to her. A smiling Doll comes forward and hands Buddy half of an orange. He makes a face at her. Mother takes the bottle and pours out a tablespoon of castor oil. \nBUDDY (wanly) Mother, cant you make it calomel instead of castor oil? \nMOTHER This is for your own good. When you look at negative, destructive things like those little filthy comic books, you are sick. Here, take this. \nBUDDY (he is resigned, there's no way out; he makes a face, swallows the castor oil) Geccch, yehh, guhhhh! \nMOTHER Stop gagging like that and putting on a show, and swallow it. \nBUDDY Uhhh, gahdam stuff! \nMOTHER What did you say, Brother? \nBUDDY I said ahhh-dam stuff. \nMOTHER No, you didn't say that, Brother. \nBUDDY Yes, I did, mother. Your hearing aid isn't working right. I said ahhh-dam stuff. \nDOLL No, Mother, he's lying... \nBUDDY Shut up, Doll. I'll cut your guts \nWASKI (happily excited, stammering) He did lie, and... and... and Mother, yesterday he stole money out of your pocketbook! \nBUDDY Quiet, you little muddy-eyed brat, or Ill kill you! \nMOTHER Children, children! Be quiet, all of you! (the children at once simmer down) The vibrations in this house are strange today. Where's Rose, anyhow? \nBUDDY She's getting herself up to go out. \nMOTHER (frowns, adjusts hearing aid) What'd you say, Brother? \nBUDDY She's getting herself up to go out. I think she's coming down the hall now. \nMOTHER Oh, yes, it's Thursday. (glances around at sound of an opening door) Hello, Rose, dear... (her eyes open wide as she stares at Rose, disconcerted; now weakly) ... my, you're... looking pretty... \nCUT TO a shot of Rose in the doorway of the kitchen. She is quite an apparition. She wears bright red lipstick, pink rouge on her cheeks, mascara and her hair is coiffed up in some outlandish manner, but her clothes are the most remarkable thing of all. \nThe skirt is of strange, pink, semi-shiny and very thin material and has about a dozen tiny little flowers that could be rosebuds sewed on it. It fits extremely snugly to say the least. The blouse seems a composite: it has frilly white sleeves that are opaque and otherwise is made of filmy white material that is hardly opaque at all. She has no bra and her breasts are half visible, the nipples denting the material. It is pretty wild for 1935. She seems to have on no underwear of any kind; the skirt, which clings to her like a bathing suit, shows no panty seams. She is carrying a shiny black patent leather pocketbook and has on high heel black patent leather shoes and no stockings. An ingenuous little smile is on her face. \nROSE How do you like my outfit? I made most of it myself. \nRose walks in, \"modeling\" the outfit and the CAMERA PICKS UP Mother. \nMOTHER (smiling, slightly aghast) Well, it's... very gay. \nWe hear the SOUND of the Model A on the driveway. \nBUDDY Here comes Daddy. \nROSE (staring down admiringly at the outfit) I have a knack for designing clothes. But I had to buy the shoes and the pocketbook. \nMOTHER (makes up her mind to defend Rose) Well, I think it's charming, Rose. (tactfully) But don't you think... ah, the skirt is a little tight? \nROSE Oh, no, that's the style. It's meant to be clinging. \nWe hear the PORCH DOOR SLAM. Smiling, happy, Rose glances around. We hear the SOUND of the kitchen door opening. \nCUT TO a POV SHOT of Daddy in the kitchen doorway. As usual, he has a rolled-up Glenville Tribune in his hand and a Straw hat on the back of his head.His hands are on his hips and he is hunched forward as if he cannot believe what he sees. \nDADDY Ye gods and little fishes. What have you done to yourself, Rose? \nON THEM ALL. Rose is smiling, happy to be the center of attention. \nROSE Nothin'. I got myself up, that's all. \nDADDY Got yourself up? \nROSE Yeah. I'm goin' out. \nDaddy walks slowly into the kitchen shaking his head. Sits at table. \nDADDY Um-hmm. Well, that is the damndest outfit I ever saw in my life. You walk down the street like that and they'll put you in jail, Rose. \nMOTHER Why, they won't either. She looks pretty. And I wish you wouldn't pick on the poor girl all the time. Don't listen to him, Rose, you look pretty, even beautiful. \nROSE (smiles affectionately at Mother) You're so sweet. \nDADDY If you've got time before you go \"out,\" get me a half-a-cup of coffee, Rose. Not a whole cup, a half-a-cup. \nROSE Why, sure, always got time to get you a half-a-cup, and one of these days I'm gonna get you a whole cup and see what happens. \n", "test2_true": "DOLL (sweetly) Daddy, Buddy was up late last night reading little dirty comic books.

You mustn't be Delilah-ish and Jezebel-ish toward your brother, dear. \nDOLL I'm only trying to help him, Mother. \nBUDDY Heh, what a hypocrite. \nMOTHER (to Daddy) I do wish you'd speak to Brother. It's true he's been looking at those horrible little books again. \nDADDY (stares sternly at Buddy) Lay off of that stuff, son. It upsets your mother. \nMOTHER (genuinely worried) I'm serious. We forget he's just a child. I wish you'd speak to him. \nDADDY I'll take him with me downtown. (glances at Rose as she comes with coffee) And you, too, Rose, if you want a ride. \nROSE Sure, love one. Here's your half-a cup of coffee. \nDaddy is staring with a very dubious frown at Rose's skirt. He slowly shakes his head. \nDADDY That's a pretty stylish skirt, Rose. The only thing I don't understand is how did you ever get it on. \nROSE (happy, pleased by his interest) Well, it has buttons. \nPoints to little buttons on right side of the skirt. \nDADDY How can the buttons stand the pressure? \nROSE There are more on the other side. \nPoints to buttons on left side. \nDADDY Turn around, darlin'. \nHappy to oblige, Rose turns around. Her plump, round, feminine behind is only too plainly revealed through the thin material. Daddy slowly shakes his head. \nDADDY (CONT'D) They'll put her in jail. The damn little fool might as well be naked. \nMOTHER (a wee mite worried) Well, it is a little tight. But it isn't as bad as all that. No one will notice unless they have such thoughts in the first place. \nDADDY Who doesn't have such thoughts? (glances at wristwatch) We'd better get going. \nMOTHER You're not having lunch? \nDADDY Just half-a-cup of coffee. I never eat, darlin', you know that. Not eating and reverse insomnia are my curses. Let's go, Rose, you and Brother, let's hit the road. \nMOTHER Rose, you and Brother wait in the car.

HILLYER HOME KITCHEN - DAY \nCUT TO Mother and Daddy at the kitchen table. \nMOTHER (earnestly) I wish you wouldn't pick on Rose and tease her like that. Of course her clothes are silly, but she's ignorant, naive, she doesn't know any better. \nDADDY The girl worries me. If she walks down the street like that, an army will be following her. \nMOTHER Well, I admit that outfit isn't very modest. But she doesn't mean any harm, she just wants to attract, attention. \nDADDY She will succeed. \nMOTHER I don't think you understand her. It isn't sex she wants, it's love she wants and this is the only way she knows how to get it. \nDADDY (musingly) That farmer in Gadsden was awful eager to get rid of her, and I'm beginning to see why. \nMOTHER He and his wife both said she had a fine moral character and was wonderful with children. \nDADDY Well, she loves children, all right.

Rose smiles sweetly, modestly. \nEXT. HILLYER DRIVEWAY - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of the Model A driving up in the driveway of the Hillyer house. \nANOTHER ANGLE on them all as they get out of the car. Rose takes Doll's hand with one hand and Waski's hand with the other. \nROSE All right, we'll play monopoly then. \nMother, Daddy and Buddy watch Rose go up the steps with Doll and Waski. \nMOTHER She's like a different person.

Someone has been walking here. \nBUDDY (reluctantly) Well, it's not very plain. \nDADDY That is because it rained recently, the rain has obscured the evidence. But you could still take plaster casts of these footprints, then match up the plaster casts with whosever shoes they are, and that way you could catch him -- understand? \nBUDDY But how would you find him? \nDADDY Well. Well, what I mean is, you could prove it was his shoes if you did catch him. But look this, Brother, it is even more interesting. Look at this mark here, and that mark over there. Now wouldn't you say those marks are the marks of a ladder? \nBUDDY Well, I don't know. (trying to sound like a fellow detective, but doesn't want Rose to get caught) No, I don't know, Daddy, I think the rain has obscured it. \nDADDY True, but if you look sharply you can see that those marks are the marks of a ladder. Now let's go back to the garage and see if the ladder has been tampered with. \nINT. GARAGE - DAY \nCUT TO a shot of Daddy and Buddy back in the garage. They are scrutinizing a wooden ladder that hangs on pegs alongside the garage. All Daddy needs is a cap and a pipe to be a dead ringer for Sherlock Holmes. He is in dead earnest about this, it is no Joke and he does not dream of being funny. \nDADDY (points to ladder, eyes narrowed) See, son? The paint is flaked off here, freshly. Look at it, Brother, there is no question about it. Some person or persons unknown have very recently tampered with this ladder. \nBUDDY Well... maybe... \nDADDY And there's only one reason anybody would want this ladder -- to get up into Rose's bedroom in the dark of night!

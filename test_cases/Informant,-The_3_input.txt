GINGER Mark? He left. You can come back. Whitacre emerges from among the tall stalks of corn where he's been watching. 
127 INTERIOR BLUE BIRD DINER- EARLY MORNING 127 Whitacre is strung out on martyrdom and insomnia. He stares at his coffee. 
LIZ TAYLOR They turned the place upside down. 
Draft: 1/15/03 110. His loyal secretary gives him a pile of mail. 
LIZ TAYLOR They went though all of this, too. 
WHITACRE I'm sorry you got dragged into this. 
LIZ TAYLOR And then they started asking me for the access code to your voice mail. Whitacre panics. 
WHITACRE Did you tell them? I don't think you have to tell them that. 
LIZ TAYLOR well, according to them I do-- but I didn't. And about two hours later Peterson told me to clean out my desk. He said I've been transferred out of Bioproducts. 
WHITACRE But, you didn't tell them? 
128 EXTERIOR ADM PLANT- DAY 128 Whitacre is parked in his MERCEDES across the road staring through the chain link fence. Trucks rumble by. 
WHITACRE (V.O.) Abe Lincoln was born 45 minutes from here and I've never been to his log cabin. I've seen post cards and I sent the kids there on a field trip. But, I've never gone. I'm sure it's very well preserved. Original beds and dining room tables and the doorways are probably smaller from when people were shorter...It's only 45 minutes away... CU on Whitacre as a sound builds in the car...A small outboard motor we've heard before. Getting LOUDER...And then a voice competes. 
COMPETING VOICE (PRE-LAP) 
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET IN TOUCH 
WITH YOU FOR DAYS... 
Draft: 1/15/03 111.

129 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- DAY 129 Whitacre stands with the leaf blower-- but the driveway is spotless. He shuts it off. Behind him is SCOTT KILMAN. 
KILMAN I'd like to talk to you about what's been going on at ADM. A beat. He hands Whitacre a card. 
KILMAN I'm interested in hearing your side of things. Whitacre takes a paranoid look around. 
WHITACRE We better go inside. We can't talk out here. 
130 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MORNING 130 Whitacre makes himself a bowl of cereal and talks on the phone. He's fully caffeinated and ready to go. 
WHITACRE They kept coming back Brian, and they only had ADM's side of things. 
SHEPARD (O.S.) Did you talk to them, Mark? What did you say? It's real important that you not talk to the press. 
WHITACRE Me? I told him I had no comment. But, they already had the story. A beat. On the counter is a NEWSPAPER. Whitacre hangs up the phone.

131 INTERIOR CTA COMMUTER TRAIN- MORNING 131 Jim Epstein reads the Journal. Pull back to reveal it's in the hands of almost EVERY OTHER EXECUTIVE on the train. 
EPSTEIN Shit. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) .Is Brian Shepard gonna lose his job for that? His standard of living? I've gone to the local junior high school on career day and talked to kids about biochemistry and the kind of career opportunities available... 
132 INTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION KITCHEN- CONTINUOUS 132 Whitacre's son, Alexander, runs, screaming into the kitchen. 
WHITACRE (V.0.) Can Brian Shepard and Bob Herndon say that, I'm the white hat... 
ALEXANDER Dad, Dad, you're on TV! Whitacre turns on the TV. A strange light blows out the windows of the kitchen. On the TV screen appears the image of: WHITACRE'S HOUSE. 
TV ANNCR: A Vice President in the Bio- products division of Fortune Five Hundred ADM, Whitacre was working as a spy for the FBI for over two years... 
WHITACRE (V.0.) I did enough for Brain Shepard. Who's gonna take care of me?

133 EXTERIOR WHITACRE MANSION- MORNING 133 A crowd of reporters and ENG CREWS have sprouted up among the corn fields. They press in on the gates. America has questions for Mark Whitacre. The door opens and Whitacre emerges. Expecting rock star exaltation-- he gets something else.

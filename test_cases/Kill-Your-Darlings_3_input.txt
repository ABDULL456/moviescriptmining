EXT. HARLEM SIDEWALK - DAWN 
Lucien drops the bloody Boy Scout knife down a grate. Jack stands guard. 
LUCIEN (O.S.) I went to Jack first. He told me to get rid of the knife. To forget the whole thing. 
They hear footsteps and turn. A black woman watches them suspiciously. 
INT. BILL'S APARTMENT - DAY 
LUCIEN (O.S.) But then I went to Bill. He told me to get a lawyer. 
Bill fingering David's pack of Lucky Strikes in his bathroom. David's blood on his hand. 
LUCIEN (O.S.) To say it was an act of self- defense. 
Lucien watches Bill light one of the bloody cigarettes and inhale. The last flare of his friend. 
Bill flushes the rest of the pack down the toilet. 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. TOMBS - DAY 
Lucien, desperate, at the bars of his cell. 
LUCIEN The D.A. is asking for my deposition. In writing. 
Allen shakes his head, there's no way he's going to do this. 
LUCIEN (pleading) We both know I can't do it. I don't know what I'm going to do. I'm going to be stuck in here for the rest of my life! 
Allen, still unsure. Lucien slides his hand down the bars until it touches Allen's. Pleads seductively. 
LUCIEN Please don't leave me here. 
The BUZZER goes off. Visiting time is over. The prison guard heads towards the cell. Allen makes a fateful choice. 
ALLEN I'll do it. 
Lucien, smiling. Leans in, whispers. 
LUCIEN We're going to say it was an "honor slaying". 
Off Allen's confused face... 
INT. LIBRARY, MAIN HALL - DAY 
A finger traces down a legal index to the definition of the phrase: "Honor Slaying." 
ALLEN (V.O.) "Related to a lethal attack committed when the accused is defending himself against a known homosexual." 
OTHER students around Allen gossip and steal glances at him as he reads to himself from the index. The murderer's "friend." 
ALLEN (V.O.) "If the accused is heterosexual, he shall be pardoned. But if the accused is homosexual, the charge of murder in the first degree..." 
Allen's attention falls to the final words: 
"SHALL STAND." 
INT. POLICE OFFICE - DAY 
Jack, in handcuffs, on the phone. PHOTOGRAPHERS, JOURNALISTS outside, clamoring for Jack to look their way. A murder with Columbia University students, this is big news. 
JACK Dad. It's five thousand dollars for bail. I know it's a lot-- 
A flash bulb FIRES. Journalists cat-calling for Jack's attention. 
JACK'S FATHER (O.S.) No Kerouac was ever wrapped up in a murder! Go to hell. 
The line goes dead. Jack has run out of options. More flashbulbs EXPLODE. More screaming for his attention. Jack whips around. 
JACK Would you all just SHUT THE HELL UP?! 
INT. LUCIEN CARR'S DORM ROOM - DAY 
Marion Carr taking down Lucien's dorm room, packing her son's belongings into the same suitcase he tried to run away with before. 
MARION CARR You must understand David has been following him for years.

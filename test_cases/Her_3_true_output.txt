CHARLES You went shopping. Get anything good? 
THEODORE Just some cables. And a fruit smoothie. 
CHARLES Always the fruit! Come on, you know what they say - you should eat your fruits and juice your vegetables. 
THEODORE I didn't know that. 
The elevator doors open and they get in. 
INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT ELEVATOR - EVENING - CONTINUOUS 
CHARLES (proselytizing) By juicing the fruits, you lose all the fibers, and that's what your body wants. That's the important part. Otherwise, it's just all sugar, Theodore. 
Theodore nods sincerely, interested. 
THEODORE Oh, that makes sense. 
AMY (pleasant but firm) Or maybe he just likes the way it tastes and if it gives him pleasure, that's good for his body, too. 
CHARLES Am I doing it again? 
AMY Maybe... 
Charles and Amy laugh awkwardly. Theodore tries to break the tension. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                          pg. 20 CONTINUED: 
THEODORE Hey, so how is the documentary going? 
AMY I have a little bit cut together but I haven't touched it in a few months. 
THEODORE I'd love to see what you got sometime. 
CHARLES You know it's always hard to find balance between a full-time career and a hobby. It's important to prioritize. 
THEODORE Yeah, I can't even prioritize between video games and internet porn. 
AMY I would laugh if that weren't true. 
Charles laughs awkwardly. The elevator doors open. 
THEODORE See you guys. 
INT. THEODORE'S APARTMENT - EVENING 
Theodore's playing the video game, his device propped on the table next to him. His avatar circles through caves. 
THEODORE We're not doing well. I've been going in circles for an hour. 
SAMANTHA You have not! You're just not optimistic. You're being very stubborn right now. 
Theodore laughs. 
SAMANTHA (CONT'D) Okay, stop walking this direction. It's the other way. 
(CONTINUED) Her                                                         pg. 21 CONTINUED: 
THEODORE Uh... 
SAMANTHA Thank you. The tunnel on the left is the only one we haven't tried. 
THEODORE No, that's the one you sent me down where I fell in the pit. 
SAMANTHA I don't think soooo... 
Theodore's avatar walks down the tunnel. 
THEODORE Oh yeah, this is different.

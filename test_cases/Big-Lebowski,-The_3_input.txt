DUDE Get out of that fucking car, man! 
The man nervously complies.  The Dude flinches at the man's movement as he gets out. 
The man cringes, reacting to the Dude's flinch. 
He is wearing a cheap blue serge suit.  He is bald with a short fringe and a mustache. 
The Dude shouts to cover his fear: 
DUDE Who the fuck are you, man!  Come on, man! 
MAN Relax, man!  No physical harm intended! 
DUDE Who the fuck are you?  Why've you been following me?  Come on, fuckhead! 
MAN Hey, relax man, I'm a brother shamus. 
The Dude is stunned. 
DUDE Brother Shamus?  Like an Irish monk? 
MAN Irish m--What the fuck are you talking about?  My name's Da Fino!  I'm a private snoop!  Like you, man! 
DUDE Huh? 
DA FINO A dick, man!  And let me tell you something: I dig your work. Playing one side against the other--in bed with everybody--fabulous stuff, man. 
DUDE I'm not a--ah, fuck it, just stay away from my fucking lady friend, man. 
DA FINO Hey hey, I'm not messing with your special lady-- 
DUDE She's not my special lady, she's my fucking lady friend.  I'm just helping her conceive, man! 
DA FINO Hey, man, I'm not-- 
DUDE Who're you working for?  Lebowski? Jackie Treehorn? 
DA FINO The Gundersons. 
DUDE The?  Who the fff-- 
DA FINO The Gundersons.  It's a wandering daughter job.  Bunny Lebowski, man. Her real name is Fawn Gunderson. Her parents want her back. 
He is fumbling in his wallet. 
DA FINO See? 
The Dude looks at the picture. 
It is probably a school portrait, unmistakably Bunny, but fresh-faced, much younger looking, with a corn-fed smile and straight Partridge Family hair and bangs. 
DUDE Jesus fucking Christ. 
DA FINO Crazy, huh?  Ran away a year ago. 
He is holding out another picture. 
The Gundersons told me to show her this when I found her. The family farm. 
A bleak farmhouse and silo are the only features on a flat snow-swept landscape. 
Outside of Moorhead, Minnesota.  They think it'll make her homesick. 
DUDE Boy.  How ya gonna keep 'em down on the farm once they seen Karl Hungus. 
He hands back the picture. 
She's been kidnapped, Da Fino.  Or maybe not, but she's definitely not around. 
DA FINO Fuck, man!  That's terrible! 
DUDE Yeah, it sucks. 
DA FINO Well maybe you and me could pool our resources--trade information-- professional courtesy--compeers, you know-- 
We hear distant yapping, growing louder with the hum of an approaching car. 
DUDE Yeah, I get it.  Fuck off, Da Fino. And stay away from my special la-- from my fucking lady friend. 
The Dude steps out to meet Walter's car as it pulls up, its passenger window open and the pomeranian leaning out and yapping. 
DENNY'S 
Four people sit at a booth:  Dieter, Kieffer, Franz, all in black leather, and a young woman with long stringy blonde hair, wearing torn and patched jeans and a ribbed sleeveless tee-shirt, worn thin with age.  She is apparently braless, and is teutonically pale with birthmarks on her face and arms. 
Notable  is  her  camera-side  leg,  which  ends in  a bandage- swaddled foot.  Dried rust-colored blood stains the tip of the bandage. The  four  are  arguing,  loudly,  in  German. They seem  very unhappy. A waitress enters with a checkpad and pen. 
WAITRESS You folks ready?

CONTINUED: He rocks back and forth, her lifeless body clutched tightly in his arms, his eyes clenched shut. The veins bulge in his neck, every muscle in his body tenses, as if there were a beast inside him trying to break free of his skin. 
INT. CASADY'S BAR & GRILL - DAY 
The local dive opens early. TOWN DRUNKS sit by themselves, smoking cigarettes, sipping the day's first hair-of--the-dog, reading the paper or staring into their beer. Victor Creed sits at the bar, carving a crude smiley face into the wood with the claw of his index finger. He looks up and sees the BARTENDER staring at him. The bartender doesn't approve of the vandalism, but he's not about to say anything. Creed taps the rim of his glass. The bartender comes over with a bottle of George Dickel Tennessee whiskey. He fills Creed's glass halfway-- a standard pour. Creed stares at the bartender. He taps the glass again. The bartender, hand shaking, fills the glass to the brim. Creed raises the whiskey to the light. 
VICTOR CREED Stuff don't work on me. I drink and drink and I never feel any different. He downs the full glass of whiskey with a swallow. He looks around the bar, at the pool table in the back, the Wurlitzer jukebox, the stacked bottles of liquor. VICTOR CREED (cont'd) You got any insurance on this place? 
BARTENDER Insurance? I guess so. Why? Creed wipes his mouth with the back of his hand. 
VICTOR CREED 'Cause it's about to get ugly. Logan walks into the tavern, sniffing the air. He sees Creed sitting on the barstool, back to the door.

CONTINUED: Logan approaches the bar, never taking his eyes off creed. Finally Creed turns to look at Logan. He stands, towering above the smaller man. Logan sees a splotch of dried blood on the back of Creed's hand. Creed knows Logan is looking at it. He lifts his hand to his mouth and licks the blood off. VICTOR CREED (cont'd) Sweet girl. Tasted like strawberry jam. The bone claws burst from Logan's hands, pale, white, and serrated. He growls and swings at Creed's head. The big man is fast. He ducks under the claws, grinning and circling like a boxer, happy that he's finally got a decent adversary. The bartender and the local drunks have seen plenty of bar fights, but not ones featuring clawed mutants. They run. VICTOR CREED (cont'd) You can scare off the civilians with those, sonny boy. But I got claws of my own. He swings, raking his talons across Logan's chest, drawing first blood. Logan lunges at Creed and the battle begins. -The pace of the combat is startling, the physical power stupendous. A missed swipe by Creed ends with him clawing out the guts of the jukebox. Logan jumps at his enemy and gets swatted into the wall, smashing the plasterboard. Creed grabs Logan by the collar and tosses him onto the pool table. Creed brings his fist down, looking to pulverize Logan's skull, but the smaller man rolls clear. Creed's fist shatters the slate and the table collapses. Clearing his head on the sawdusted floor, Logan sees the eight ball rolling past. He picks it up and hurls it at Creed's head. Creed catches the eight ball in his left hand and squeezes his fist shut. He opens his hand and lets the powdered remains spill onto the floor. Logan springs to his feet and swings at creed, again and again, his claws whooshing through the air. l CONTTNTJRT) ) 
CONTINUED: (2) Creed, despite his bulk, is an elegant fighter. He circles just out of reach, grinning as the claws slash past his face. Creed grabs Logan's right wrist as it flies by. He grabs the left wrist. His wet fangs glisten as they plunge toward Logan's throat. 
I With no room to dodge, Logan drives his head forward, smashing Creed's face with a glorious headbutt. 
I As Creed staggers back, Logan kicks him in the chest, knocking the big man over the bar, where he crashes into the bottles of liquor and slides to the floor in a tumult of glass shards and alcohol. Logan sees a lit cigarette in an ashtray on one of the tables. He picks the butt up and flicks it over the bar. The cigarette ignites the spilt alcohol. Creed roars and rises to his feet, a burning man. He vaults over the bar and advances on Logan. The flames consume his overcoat, licking at his skin. Creed slaps them out with his palms, apparently oblivious to the pain. VICTOR CREED (cont'd) You put up a better fight than your girl did. Creed snatches Logan and slings him headfirst through the plate glass window. 
EXT. PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS 
Logan hits the snow-covered pavement hard, splinters -of glass in his hair, his face bloodied from dozens of small cuts. Creed steps out the bar. As Logan struggles to his feet Creed kicks out his legs and drops him again. Creed crouches beside Logan, grabs the back of his head, and smashes his face into the concrete. The beating gets savage, creed hammering Logan again and again. Logan's healing factor cannot keep up with the violence being done to his body. 
VICTOR CREED Time you got declawed, kitty kat. Creed lifts his heavy black boot and brings it down hard on the extended claws of Logan's left hand. 
I CONTTNTTFT)1 
CONTINUED: Logan howls as the-bone claws shatter. Creed repeats the process on Logan's right hand. VICTOR CREED. (cont'd) You were a tough little guy. But there's always someone tougher. Creed plunges his clawed hand into Logan's chest. Logan gasps, eyes widening. His tolerance for pain is world-class but this is another level of suffering. VICTOR CREED (cont'd) And it's always me. Creed stands, staring down at Logan's unmoving body. Sirens moan in the distance. Creed walks away. Logan bleeds in the snow. We rise above him, higher and higher, his battered body dwindling as we rise with the smoke. 
INT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY 
Two MALE NURSES shove a gurney down the corridor. Logan is flat on his back, bloody and unconscious. A SURGEON hurries after them, pulling on latex gloves. 
SURGEON We know what we're looking at? 
MALE NURSE #1. Bar fight. 
MALE NURSE #2 Multiple knife wounds.

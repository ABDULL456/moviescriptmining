ASAEL ...that you drink too much and are no longer fit to lead us. 
TUVIA .Maybe they're right. Asael looks at him. No longer the brother he once idealized. 
ASAEL Zus would have punched him senseless. 
TUVIA Zus. 
ASAEL I miss him. 
Ã TUVIA He has made his choice. He reels away toward the woods. 
CUT TO: 
122A IN HIS ZEMYLANKA - LATER 122A Tuvia is lying in his bunker, vomiting and burning up with fever. Shimon has brought him soup. 
SHIMON Drink this. 
(WINKS) From the bottom of the pot. Tuvia can barely get the soup down. 
TUVIA ...the way they look at me... with their pasty faces. Let them starve, we're all going to die out here anyway. 
SHIMON Not easy being the big boss. Moses was a lonely man when he led us out of bondage. 
TUVIA ...Moses. 
SHIMON So I'm a sucker for a biblical allusion. But what is society without leaders. Without leaders, we falter.

TUVIA I am not a leader. 
SHIMON Neither was Moses, but somehow that seemed to work out. 
CUT TO: 
123 THE PARTISAN CAMP 123 Several partisans are singing a drinking song while Zus silently soaks his feet in a bucket. Lova walks in. His face is black and blue. 
ZUS Lova, what happened? Who did this? Lova sits and buries his head in his hands. 
ZUS (CONT'D) Lova. Tell me. Who? 
LOVA Gramov. Two others. I used the officer's latrine. 
ZUS For this they beat you? Lova is trying not to weep. 
LOVA They said they wouldn't shit in the same hole as a Jew. Zus gets to his feet. 
CUT TO: 
123A INT. PANCHENKO'S TENT -- MOMENTS LATER 123A 
Zus bursts in to find Panchenko deep in conversation with Gramov and others. They look up at the intrusion. 
ZUS Forgive me, Commander. 
PANCHENKO Zus. Join us. He offers him a glass of vodka. Zus doesn't take it. 
ZUS I want to report the mistreatment of a comrade. Gramov looks up. Zus meets his eye.

ZUS (CONT'D) This man beat Comrade Lova -- for no reason at all. 
GRAMOV I had a perfectly good reason. He is a Jew. The other men LAUGH. Panchenko frowns at Gramov. 
PANCHENKO --and you are an ignorant Tartar. (offers Zus vodka) Ignore him. Here... 
ZUS Anti-semitism is a violation of Party discipline. Panchenko sighs. Does he really have to deal with this? 
PANCHENKO He's right, Gramov. Apologize to the Jew. 
GRAMOV I apologize, Jew. 
PANCHENKO There. You see? (...a command) Now drink up. Zus doesn't know what to do. He accepts the vodka. 
124 EXT. THE BIELSKI CAMP (TO ESTABLISH) 124

{"train": "THE WAY BACK \nWritten by \nPeter Weir \nInspired by the book \"The Long Walk\" \nby Slavomir Rawicz \nShooting Draft: Sofia, January 2009 \n1 AERIAL PANORAMA - DAY TO NIGHT 1 \nA slow, steady, downward view. The camera seemingly floats as the curve of the globe passes beneath. Beginning in the green jungles of Sikkim in Northern India it crosses the Himalayas, down into Tibet and beyond to China - the zigzag line of the Great Wall clearly visible. Then the Gobi desert is flowing beneath, and as the light begins to fade, Mongolia gives way to the Russian Steppe, and as dusk turns to night we are over Siberia - gliding North over Lake Baikal, and onward across forested hills and valleys. A sense of utter remoteness in this silent landscape. Then a tiny shaved patch within the primeval forest - a bald rectangle of ground, crisscrossed by faint probing lights. The camera slows, and hovers. \n2 EXT. SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 2 \nOut of the blackness, the momentary glimpse of a barbed wire fence, lit by the combing fingers of a searchlight. Another angle, and the silhouette of distant timber buildings is briefly etched, before the light passes and all is again in darkness. Closer, on a canvas-sided barrack building - ghostly shadows projected on the wall. \nSUPER: 'SOVIET LABOR CAMP 105, SIBERIA, 1940'. \n3 INT. BARRACKS, CAMP 105, SIBERIA - NIGHT 3 \nA long rectangular building, the walls lined with two tiered bunks of rough-hewn logs. In the centre - a metal stove with a chimney stretching out through the roof. A dim central bulb illuminates some 150 men, aged from 16 to 60, most sitting or lying on their bunks. Some wear scraps of army uniform, or civilian clothing, others in prison issued padded jackets. Some, from the Asian territories, still ear something of their national costume. Included among them are groups of foreigners from recently occupied countries and a Babel of languages drifts through the fetid air. It's a wide ranging mix of types, of race, of class. They're miserable, starving and ill. There is no camp camaraderie and they eye each other with indifference or suspicion. Most of these men are political prisoners, known as 'Politicals' or 'S8ers', after the section of the Soviet Penal Code that has put them here. Near the stove, and contrasted with the 'Politicals', a group are gathered about a card game on a lower bunk. These men look healthier, and are further distinguished by their tattoos. \n(CONTINUED) \n3 CONTINUED: 3 These are the URKI, some dozen of them, regular criminals, and from their manner the undisputed masters of the block. Sitting facing each other - VALKA, thirties, heavily tattooed, flash of a steel-caped tooth. His opponent, BOHDAN, older, and the 'Pakhan', the 'boss' of this criminal gang. Bohdan shuffles a deck of home-made cards. [All DIALOGUE IN THE CAMP IS IN RUSSIAN, SUB-TITLED, \nEXCEPT WHERE INDICATED THAT INMATES SPEAK ENGLISH]. \nBOHDAN \n(IN RUSSIAN) What've you got? VALKA removes his coat, passes it to BOHDAN who examines it briefly. \nBOHDAN (CONT'D) Think I want your stinking lice farm? \nVALKA Polish tailor. He shows the label. \nVALKA (CONT'D) See? From Krakov. Good as new. BOHDAN nods to his minder who opens a battered wooden suitcase - a glimpse of hoarded food. The minder puts his hand on a lump of bread lying beside a length of sausage. BOHDAN nods. The bread is placed beside the coat. \nVALKA (CONT'D) And the sausage. BOHDAN stares at him, shakes his head, 'no'. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Bohdan, you're a dog's prick, I swear. I hope you die with an axe in your skull, and your balls ripped out. The swearing is more or less a ritual and provokes no reaction. \nVALKA (CONT'D) OK. For the bread. \n(CNNTTNTTFD ) \n3 CONTINUED: ( 2) 3 BOHDAN shuffles and deals. He separates his cards with the long fingernail of his little finger. In a few rapid plays, VALKA is left coat-less. Apart from the half-dozen thugs surrounding the players, the game is watched by two 'Politicals', who have just entered with a load of wood for the stove. The elder, SMITH, a hard-face man in his late forties, the other ANDREI, early twenties. VALKA signals to YURI who takes three 'tailor-made' cigarettes from his pocket, passes them carefully to VALKA who lays them before BOHDAN. \nBOHDAN For the bread. \nVALKA For the bread, and the sausage, bastard! BOHDAN enjoying himself. \nBOHDAN Throw in that crappy shirt you're wearing and I might be tempted. Smiles from the gang. VALKA knows he's being mocked but he's desperate. His eyes flick down to the sausage. Then he takes off his shirt. He sits bare-chested, a tattooed portrait of LENIN on his left breast looking across at STALIN on his right. BOHDAN deals, and again VALKA loses. VALKA's mate YURI places a padded prison jacket over his bony shoulders, which he shrugs off irritably, then offers to BOHDAN. \nBOHDAN (CONT'D) I don't play for regulation issue crap. VALKA lights a cigarette. \nBOHDAN (CONT'D) All done, Valka? VALKA tries to conceal his mounting tension behind a veil of cool. \nVALKA I go on credit. \nBOHDAN 'Credit'? \n(CONTINUED) \n3 CONTINUED: ( 3) VALKA nervously fingers an aluminium crucifix hanging by a cord from his neck. Etched on the cross a naked woman. \nAs they approach one of the prisoners looks up to an arch stretching across the gates - a hand-painted sign in Russian subtitled: 'LABOR IS HONOR, GLORY, NOBILITY, AND \nHEROISM'. The prisoner is JANUSZ, early twenties and he exchanges a look with the man beside him, TOMASZ, about the same age. ANOTHER ANGLE shows a line of prisoners, five abreast, marching toward them on their way to work. They have their attendant guards and dogs and as the two columns pass each other the contrast between the half-starved, ill looking 'old' prisoners and the comparative health of the 'new', could not be more apparent - 'Is this what we are to become?' on the faces of the 'new'. We glimpse some of those already established - they include BOHDAN, and VALKA, and further back - SMITH and KHABAROV. As they pass they look across to JANUSZ and TOMASZ, both Polish, and behind them to VOSS, a tall young Latvian with a mop of white-blonde hair. Behind VOSS - ZORAN, a blanket over his three-piece suit. Beside him, another Pole - KAZIK, at seventeen, the youngest in the group. \n9 EXT. 'THE ZONE', CAMP 105 - DAY 9 \nThe newly arrived prisoners assemble between the various buildings - an area known as the 'ZONE'. \n(CNNTTNTTFD ) \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 8. \n9 CONTINUED: 9 The camp is being expanded, and everywhere are piles of cut timber, coils of wire, and work going on replacing old canvas-sided barracks with new timber ones. The Spring thaw has turned recently melted snow into slush, and duck-boards are hastily laid to allow the Commandant to cross to the assembled prisoners. He walks with his subordinate and LAZAR who is FOREMAN of the new camp construction. LAZAR carries a sheaf of plans, and the COMMANDANT stops, studies a drawing, then impatiently issues an order dismissing him. The COMMANDANT mounts a box, accepting a folder of documents from his subordinate, who has in turn received them from the escorting guard. The COMMANDANT surveys the prisoners before him. He's a man in his fifties with a bland but not unintelligent cast to his features. He looks up from the collection of documents in his hand. \nCOMMANDANT Enemies of the People! Look about you...and understand... it is not our guns, or our dogs, or our wire, that forms your prison. Siberia is your prison. All four million square miles of it. Here in Camp 105, you will work hard. Work and you eat. Eat and you live. Close on JANUSZ and his friends. \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 9. \n10-13 OMITTED 10-13 \nA14 EXT. THE ZONE, CAMP 105 - DAY A14 \nLater, the newly arrived prisoners exit the wash-house, heads and beards shaved. In the background a glimpse of others waiting their turn. To one side of the wash- house, a pile of their luggage. A couple of guards sort through their belongings, pocketing the odd item. JANUSZ, VOSS and KAZIK, heads shaved, exit the hut. JANUSZ's attention is caught by the men working on replacing the old stockade wall with a new double barbed- wire fence. The overseer, LAZAR, gives a signal and a section of the old wall falls to the ground. \n14 EXT. CAMP KITCHEN, THE ZONE - NIGHT 14 \nThe prisoners move in a line toward an open window in the side of the kitchen building. Here, under the watchful eye of the cook - one of BODHAN's men - a single serve of thin soup is slopped into their metal bowls. One has no bowl, so he uses his hat. JANUSZ and his friends shuffle toward the window. Their attention is caught by a group of blind prisoners feeling their way along the side of the kitchen hut, a hand on the shoulder of the man in front. \nVOSS (TO JANUSZ) \n(IN ENGLISH) Night blindness. Saw it in the transit camp.. .vitamin deficiency. SMITH, a couple of places ahead in the line, turns on hearing English spoken. As JANUSZ moves forward he watches several wild-eyed men scrambling about in a pile of kitchen slops thrown into the mud by the kitchen door. They find here the odd scrap of food, or simply soak their fingers in the slime, then lick them clean. \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 10. \n14 CONTINUED: 14 SMITH, having been served, moves away, retrieving a hoarded slice of bread from within his jacket. He dips it into the soup, raises it to his mouth when a corner of the bread drops to the ground. One of the garbage- eaters, dives for it, but SMITH is too quick for him, placing a boot over the scrap of bread. JANUSZ watches as SMITH picks up the bread, cleans off the dirt and eats it, his every move watched by the starving man at his feet. JANUSZ offers the remainder of his soup to the man who greedily drinks it. SMITH and JANUSZ stare at each other. \nSMITH \n(IN ENGLISH) Planning to survive on half rations, son? JANUSZ surprised by the American accented English. \nJANUSZ \n(IN ENGLISH) He's an old man. \nSMITH I'm an old man. But I'll be alive in the morning. He won't. He goes to move away, hesitates, turns back to JANUSZ. \nSMITH (CONT'D) 'Kindness'. That can kill you here. You'll learn that. He places the last morsel of bread in his mouth, and chewing slowly, turns and walks away. \nKHABAROV (V.0.) \n(IN ENGLISH) American. JANUSZ turns to find KHABAROV beside him looking at SMITH's retreating back. \nJANUSZ American? He looks back to SMITH walking away toward the barracks. \nKHABAROV Stalin doesn't like foreigners. That includes Poles. You are Polish aren't you? JANUSZ still staring after SMITH. \n(CONTTNTTFD ) \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 11. \n14 CONTINUED: ( 2) \nJANUSZ nods. \nJANUSZ Yes, I am. \nKHABAROV I love you Poles, your burning sense of injustice, your yearning for freedom. (He offers his hand). \nKHABAROV (CONT'D) Khabarov. Andrei Timofeyevich. JANUSZ looks at him - he wears a distinctive coat, trimmed with fur - something refined about him, 'aristocratic' even. He offers his hand, and they shake. \n15 CONTINUED: 15 \nKHABAROV They are considered the by-product of bourgeoisie society and therefore 'Friends of the People'. We political prisoners are 'Enemies of the People'. Russia has become one vast prison - slave labor. You see even this camp is expanding to take in another thousand prisoners. JANUSZ looks over to a group of Asiatic prisoners. \nKHABAROV (CONT'D) From the far reaches of the Soviet Empire - all scooped up in the net like so many minnows, poor creatures. \nJANUSZ And do any ever wriggle out of the net? KHABAROV considers a moment, then leads him away from the surrounding prisoners. He lowers his voice to a whisper. \nKHABAROV You should be more careful. Stalin has eyes and ears everywhere, even in here. He leans closer to JANUSZ. \nKHABAROV (CONT'D) In a camp like this you'll be dead in a year. If not literally then in spirit. \nJANUSZ And how long have you been here? \n(CONTTNTTF.D 1 \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 15. \n15 CONTINUED: ( 2) 15 \nKHABAROV Eleven months and twenty-nine days. KHABAROV offers his hand. \nKHABAROV (CONT'D) Good night, friend. \n16-17 OMITTED 16-17 \nA18 EXT. THE ZONE, CAMP 105 - DAWN A18 \nIn bone-chilling cold the prisoners form up in their brigades as a guard begins counting them. JANUSZ looks toward a barrack building where the bodies of several men who died overnight are being carried out and laid on the ground - among them the 'garbage-eater' from the night before. JANUSZ glances over toward SMITH who stares impassively ahead. GUARD NO. 1 is visible, checking paper work at the camp gates. \nAB18 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST, ABOVE MINE - DAY AB18 \nFollow a bird as it hops from branch to branch, pausing every now and then to listen to the sounds of axes and saws drifting from the forest floor. JANUSZ and his friends - VOSS, TOMASZ, KAZIK and ZORAN - work at trimming felled trees of branches, and then sawing them into lengths. SMITH and his gang work nearby. He watches JANUSZ peeling strips of bark from a pine-tree and stuffing them in his pocket. KHABAROV, too, works here with a third gang, cutting and trimming the trees. \nAC18 MINE SITE - DAY AC 18 On the valley floor, below towering cliffs, some 150 men haul rocks in wooden wheelbarrows from the mine entrance across a maze of tracks to waiting trucks. A fire blazes in a 44 gallon drum set up in an open-sided wooden shelter. Here BOHDAN and his criminal associates supervise the work. VALKA has fallen on a slippery slope within the Urka hierarchy following his losses and growing debt. \n( CC)NTTNTTFD ) \nAC18 CONTINUED: AC18 BOHDAN amuses himself by throwing stones at VALKA, warning him away from the fire like a stray dog. Guards placed at vantage points, stamp their feet to keep warm, occasionally shouting at the exhausted prisoners to work harder or move faster. Death is casual here. A man falls. If found to be dead he is left where he fell, bodies to be collected and counted at the end of the day. \nAD18 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - DAY AD18 \nJANUSZ and his group dump a load of trimmed logs in a bay by the mine entrance. He hesitates as the others move away, staring into the black hole leading into the mountain. Eerie sounds drift up from deep below. A look of utter dread on his face. \n18 EXT. EDGE OF FOREST, ABOVE MINE - DUSK 18 \nThe prisoners work hard to fill their quotas - VOSS swings his axe like a demon, but even with his contribution the cut pile of logs is a long way from the mark showing at the top of the storage bay. BOHDAN, the overseer, moves amongst the various working gangs, measuring their completed piles of logs. JANUSZ's group are still only half way to a full quota. KHABAROV leaves his gang and approaches JANUSZ. \nKHABAROV \n(IN ENGLISH) Quickly now, half-quota means half- rations. Quota is Law here. \nJANUSZ No-one could meet that quota even if they were fed and rested. KHABAROV calls for them to follow him. He leads them at a jog deeper into the trees - pointing out various shapes buried in fallen leaves and drifts of snow. He clears away the leaves and snow to reveal a pile of old grey cut timber. \nKHABAROV Cut last year and never collected! Quickly hide them inside your fresh cut timber! BOHDAN moving closer. It becomes a race to transport all the old logs to their pile and to conceal them inside the fresh cut logs. \n(CONTINUED) \n18 CONTINUED: \nThey just make it, but BOHDAN notices the end of an old grey log poking out from the center of the stack. He stops his measuring of their quota. A tense moment, then he nods and leaves. KHABAROV crosses from his gang to join them. \nJANUSZ He knows. KHABAROV shrugs. \nKHABAROV He knows, but he doesn't care, as long as his arse is protected. This is 'Tufta'. Bull-shit. JANUSZ nods his thanks. \n19-22 OMITTED 19-22 \nA23 EXT. A DIRT ROAD THROUGH A FOREST - DUSK A23 \nKHABAROV (CONT'D) Few ever escape the camps. I've waited for someone like you, someone with the strength and will to see it through. \nJANUSZ \n(EXCITED) Can't go West - apart from the Soviets, there's the Germans. East? All Soviet right to the Pacific.. .it would have to be South? KHABAROV nods, beams at him like a teacher with a very bright pupil. \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) They marched as due North from the railway, I glimpsed a lake, but I have no idea where we are. KHABAROV squats down, JANUSZ joins him, and smoothing out a drift of snow KHABAROV sketches a map of a lake and indicates the location of the camp. \nKHABAROV We believe about 500 kilometers north of Lake Baikal. \nJANUSZ We could follow the edge of the Lake, it runs due South. \nKHABAROV \n(NODDING) Then on to the Trans-Siberian Railway. Cross that and you're close to the Mongolian border. And freedom. \n( C.ONTTNTTFT) ) \nRevised 3/4/09 (Yellow) 21. \n26 CONTINUED: ( 2) 26 JANUSZ's eyes burn with excitement. KHABAROV takes his arm, as if drawing energy from the younger man. \nKHABAROV (CONT'D) Spring is already upon us. It would have to be next autumn. \nJANUSZ Why wait? \nKHABAROV It's 1000 kilometers to the border, maybe more. We need careful planning, stock-pile food. I've already begun - trading, dealing. You could do the same. In the Autumn the weather is predictable. We need the early snows to cover our tracks. JANUSZ nods. \nJANUSZ What about my friends? \nKHABAROV If you trust them. But they won't all survive. \nJANUSZ But they'd die free men. KHABAROV offers his hand, and they shake. \nA27 INT. BARRACK - NIGHT A27 \nKHABAROV and JANUSZ enter, having buried the shirt in the snow. KHABAROV indicates LAZAR, sitting on a bunk , and whispers. \nKHABAROV That's Lazar. He was architect. In Kiev.Now he is grave robber - me too. (Whispers) We sneak out at night.Through the wire. He moves away. \n27 EXT. CAMP - DAWN 27 \nTo the echoing clang of the hammer and iron, JANUSZ and KHABAROV hurry to where they buried their clothing. \n(CNNTTNTTRD ) \nRevised 3/4/09 (Yellow) 21A. \n27 CONTINUED: 27 CLOSE on the tips of the cloth showing above the snow - a teeming mound of lice on each. WIDER, as they shake their clothing free of the lice, and hurry over to join the assembly of prisoners at the kitchen servery window for their meagre breakfast ration. At the same time the morning ritual of carrying out the bodies of those who have died overnight is underway. The corpses are stacked like cords of wood for burial. JANUSZ pauses, a muttered prayer on his lips. Then he's passing the hospital barracks - the usual crowd of desperately ill prisoners hoping to be admitted, to be excused another day of the killing work, the majority turned away. He joins the line at the kitchen. The days' bread ration is being weighed and issued. If not exactly 500 grams a little is added or subtracted, the cook keeping trimmed slices, placing them in a tin. \n28 EXT. THE ZONE/CAMP EXTERIOR - DAWN 28 \nHaving been counted once, inside the camp, the brigade of prisoners is marched outside the gates where the armed guards who will escort them to work are waiting. GUARD NO. 1 begins counting them again. It's much colder than usual, prisoners beating their arms to keep warm, a high wind blowing. Khabarov stands with JANUSZ. \nKHABAROV Temperature is dropping. Below 60 they're not supposed to send us out. Know how to tell the temperature? You see frosty fog - it's 40 below. If you exhale easily but in a rasping fashion? 50 below. When your spit freezes? More than 60 below. He hoiks and spits. Close on the ball of spit mid-air. Freeze-frame. It's a solid glittering crystal of ice. \n29 OMITTED 29 \nA30 EXT. ROAD THROUGH FOREST - DAY A30 \nThe freezing wind has picked up considerably, driving sleet against the column of prisoners, forcing them to a halt in an open snow-covered area. The column halts, the guards anxiously confer - 'to go back or continue on'? The prisoners shiver in the biting cold, some collapse, their fellow prisoners unwilling or unable to help them. JANUSZ and his friends find themselves near SMITH and watch as he hails a GUARD. \nSMITH (Shouts in Russian) We need to make shelter. \nGUARD NO. 1 Who asked you? \nSMITH We'll freeze to death in less than an hour. \nGUARD NO. 1 I couldn't give a fuck if you drop dead right now. \nKAZIK Yes, but on their horses probably. \nPROF No. Same. On people. \nKAZIK How do you know that? \nPROF I was professor of Egyptology. Leningrad University. KAZIK manages a look at his companion, before putting even more effort into dragging the load. \n32 INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MINE - DAY 32 \nA man, enveloped in clouds of white steam, points a long pipe at the frozen rock and gravel - the heat making it easier for the pick and shovel men to dig. This is the 'POINT-MAN', and he opens and shuts valves on the pipe- stem which regulates the hot steam that travels along pipes leading back to a primitive boiler. Men try to warm themselves by working near the POINT-MAN, and when the guards are not around they clutch the pipes in their hands gaining a few moments of precious warmth. SMITH knows how to work the system and has found a spot here working beside the POINT-MAN. He looks across to see JANUSZ staggering up the slope toward the distant mine entrance, where a guard can be seen silhouetted against the light. He watches a moment, something not right about JANUSZ. He lays his shovel aside and hurries after him. \n33 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 33 \nJANUSZ scrambling toward the surface. He stumbles, falls to his knees. He looks down, sees something on the ground. \nJANUSZ'S VISION - DAY Something buried in the dirt and rubble - paving stones. He clears away the debris to reveal a stone path. Looking up he sees the path leads to a gate framed by a hedge. His P.O.V. as he moves up the path to the gate. His unseen hand opens the gate. Now the view is of the path as he walks forward - a series of worn flagstones, then the camera tilts up to see a closed front door. A pan to the left of the door - to see a loose brick in the wall. \n34 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 34 \nCLOSE on JANUSZ, as SMITH is suddenly beside him, grabbing his arm and swinging him into the darkness of an adjoining tunnel. \nSMITH Are you crazy? They'll shoot you. \nJANUSZ Got to get out! SMITH stares at him. He's delirious and begins to shake with cold. SMITH grabs his shoulder and drags him back to where the POINT'-MAN works, thrusting JANUSZ's hands around the pipe. The POINT-MAN waves them away but SMITH bribes him with a slice of bread. SMITH turns back to JANUSZ - the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its effect. \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) It can be done. \nSMITH What can be done? \nJANUSZ He knows a way through the wire. SMITH slaps a hand over his mouth, glancing at the Point- Man, before dragging JANUSZ further away. \n(CONTINUED) \n34 CONTINUED: 34 \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) \n(A WHISPER) He has a plan. \nSMITH Who? \nJANUSZ His name is Khabarov. Now SMITH understands. \nSMITH The actor. \nJANUSZ You know him? \nSMITH He has no intention of escaping. \nJANUSZ What? \nSMITH He's aliar. Been here foryears -seeksout new arrivals, mewhen Ifirstcame here. He justlikes totalkabout escape. I'veknown others like him. \nJANUSZ Why should I believe you? \nSMITH (shakes his head) Nothing is for nothing in the camps. From you he gets your energy, your spirit. You feed his 'dream' of escape. You help keep him alive. He's no more than a leech. \nJANUSZ You're a cold bastard, Mister. \nSMITH \n(SHRUGS) I'm still alive, that's all I know. But I won't be in six months. And neither will you. Not in the mines. So, if you're serious about making a run for it - I'm in. \n(CONTINUED) \n34 CONTINUED: (2) 34 \nJANUSZ I thought you were a loner? \nVALKA There are no secrets here. \nJANUSZ What do you want? \nVALKA The game goes against me. Small debt - lose fingers. Big debt, they take head. Me, big debt. But one thing I never gamble is my Wolf. He removes the knife from JANUSZ's throat, tilts the blade to show a wolf's head incised into the blade. \nVALKA (CONT'D) In forest you need knife to survive. Without? A miracle. He leans in close to JANUSZ's ear. \nVALKA (CONT'D) You need a knife, and I need miracle to get me out of here. With a conjurer's ease he spins the knife in his fingers and arches his eyebrows - 'Deal'? \n39 EXT. CAMP PERIMETER - DAWN 39 \nHeavy snow still falling as shadowy figures run toward the wire. Shouted commands and the beam of a searchlight isolates them - not the fugitives, but a group of guards. They've found a gap in the wire. A great yelping and baying as the dog-handlers join them, releasing the dogs into the gap, then following them toward the distant forest. \n40 EXT. FOREST, SIBERIA - DAWN 40 \nThen seven fugitives, now including VALKA, weave in and out of the trees at a fast jog. Snow whirls about them, as, gasping for breath, they attempt to keep up with JANUSZ. In the rear KAZIK holds onto VOSS' rope belt, occasionally stumbling, but VOSS has him up and on his feet fast enough to keep up with the others. JANUSZ pauses briefly every now and then to study the moss growing on the North side of tree-trunks, before plunging on Southward. \n41 FURTHER ALONG 41 They top a rise to a clearing and pause to catch their breath. The snow continues to fall but JANUSZ will allow no rest and moves off without a backward glance. \n42 FURTHER STILL 42 JANUSZ is out in front when SMITH stops, resting his hands on his knees, gulping for air. The others stop too, VALKA dropping to his knees. JANUSZ runs back to VALKA, drags him to his feet. \nJANUSZ Get up. Or we die right now. You know how fast dogs travel. He turns to the others. \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) Run, damn you! Run! He moves to SMITH. \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) Is it time for me to carry you? \n(CONTINUED) \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 34. \n42 CONTINUED: 42 SMITH waves him away, gets up and continues. \n43 EXT. ANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST - DAY 43 \nA feeble light penetrates the forest as day begins. The snow still falling heavily as the men stumble into a deep depression, and facing a steep climb find they can go no further. KAZIK turns his face to the light. His sight is returning with the day and he nods gratefully to VOSS. In the deep stillness the sound of distant voices. They look about them. Hard to tell the direction of the sound. JANUSZ is on his feet - there's plenty of fallen timber but no obvious place to hide. He draws a circle in the snow, mimes digging to the others, then turns to VALKA, whispers. \nJANUSZ Knife . VALKA has never taken an order from a 'Political' in his short life. \nVALKA What? \nJANUSZ Your knife. With a glance to the others he reluctantly draws his knife from his boot and passes it to JANUSZ. While the group furiously dig, JANUSZ collects and trims fallen timber. As the hole deepens, JANUSZ begins to make a trellis roof. The voices change direction. They go still. Are they surrounded? They resume their digging with greater intensity, the hole now more than a meter at its deepest, JANUSZ placing the branches to cover their hide. \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 35. \n44-46 OMITTED 44-46 \nA47 EXT FOREST - DAY A47 Several angles on the forest. Utter stillness.Light snow falling. \nAB47 EXT. THE HIDE, FOREST - DAY AB47 \nCamera moves slowly toward their hide, wisps of vapor rise from below the surface. The Russian voices are closer now. \nAC47 INT. THE HIDE - DAY AC47 \nIt's like an Indian sweat-lodge as the fugitives sit shoulder to shoulder in a tight circle, ears straining, sweat running down their faces. The voices closer still. A tense moment, and then they are passing, the voices fading into silence. \n47 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, SIBERIA - NIGHT 47 \nThe strong wind drives snow and sleet horizontally, and as they push forward they cover their faces to keep the snow from throat and lungs. VALKA, his arm wrapped defensively across his eyes, staggers and falls to his knees. JANUSZ turns back, drags him to his feet. KAZIK hangs onto the back of VOSS' coat, VOSS at times literally dragging him along. \nRevised 3/11/09 (Goldenrod) 36. \n48 EXT. A TREE, FOREST - NIGHT 48 \nWith VALKA's knife JANUSZ cuts a square of bark, pulls it from the tree, cuts two triangular holes some centimeters apart, then rams the base of the bark piece into VALKA'S collar. It's a crude mask. \n49 EXT. THE PROCESSION, FOREST - NIGHT 49 \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) Valka? VALKA reluctantly reaches into his coat - something familiar about it with its distinctive fur-lined collar. \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) That's Khabarov's coat. \n(CONTTNTTFD ) \nAC51 CONTINUED: ( 3) AC51 He smiles at JANUSZ as he produces a bulging sack from inside his coat. \nVALKA (CONT'D.) Yes...and... From the sack he produces KHABAROV's hoarded supply of food and other items. Off JANUSZ's reaction - \nVALKA (CONT'D) He was going to inform. Don't worry. I talk to him. Everything o.k. He puts the goods back in the sack and goes to place it inside his coat. \nJANUSZ We share. JANUSZ reaches out for the sack of food. VALKA glances at the others, then passes it to him. TOMASZ has already begun to organize seven slices of bread laying one of VOSS's fish heads on each. one. He hands them out. They eat in silence, savoring every bite. ZORAN removes the fish-head, passing it back to TOMASZ. Then he places a thin layer of snow on the bread like a canape. He eats daintily, his little finger extended like a dowager at a tea party, raising a smile from his exhausted companions. \nAD51 EXT. FOREST - NIGHT. AD51 \nThe wind is rising, whipping flurries of snow through the trees. SMITH and JANUSZ are in the lead. SMITH refers back to VALKA. \nSMITH You've made a bargain with the Devil. \nJANUSZ \n(TERSE) Have you got a knife? They move on in silence, JANUSZ not liking his bargain any more than SMITH. \nAE51 LATER, THAT NIGHT AE51 SMITH finds himself walking beside VALKA. \n(MNTTNTTFD ) \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 40. \nAE51 CONTINUED: AE51 \nVALKA For direction he looks at grass and mosses, what's that? I swear to God he better know what he's doing. \nSMITH You should be grateful you're here at all. \nVALKA Gratitude is for dogs. He moves away from SMITH, his eyes fixed on JANUSZ, who is again studying moss on the side of a tree. \n51 EXT. FOREST - DAWN 51 \nThe group in the shelter of the trees. The sky is overcast but at least it's not too cold. Everywhere about is deep snow from the recent storm. TOMASZ prepares a meal from their dry rations, small portions for men who have expended so much energy. KAZIK examines his swollen blistered feet. VALKA has his boots off, shaking them. \nVALKA (TO KAZIK) Clean inside boots, foot-cloths. KAZIK copies him. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Man on run - one tiny piece of sand can make cripple, I swear to God. The others are listening, and some do likewise. \n52 EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 52 \nWith lengths of wood as 'ski-poles', the group begin to make up lost time. VOSS has lashed his rope-belt to KAZIK who walks behind him. SMITH wonders about this, but says nothing. They pause at the top of a rise amongst the trees, on hearing the sound of dogs howling from behind. \nJANUSZ Wolves it's only wolves. \n(CONTTNTTFT) ) \n52 CONTINUED: \nRelieved, they continue forward. \nZORAN 'Only wolves', great. \nA53 THE SUN \nA53 From behind clouds, the sun appears, shafting light toward the earth. \nEXT. RIDGE, MOUNTAIN TOP, SIBERIA - DAY 53 \nThe upturned faces of the fugitives. Sun worshipers all. JANUSZ a short distance away. He plants his 'ski-pole' in the snow, marking the tip of its shadow with a pine- cone. They watch as he draws a line in the snow from the second marker - about a foot in length. Then he stands, and with the toe of his left foot at the first pine-cone and the toe of his right foot at the end of the line in the snow, he points, calling to them. \nJANUSZ South! To Lake Baikal! Cheers from the watching group. \nJANUSZ It's how we'll survive isn't it, Mister? \nZORAN Fish? I don't eat fish. \n(RNNTTNUED ) \nRevised 3/17/09 (Cherry) 44. \n62 CONTINUED: ( 2) 62 \nSMITH Then you'll die. KAZIK has a far-away look in his sight-less eyes. He speaks in Polish to JANUSZ. \nVOSS What does he say? \nTOMASZ He asked Janusz if he believes in God's forgiveness. This has come from seemingly nowhere. \nSMITH Save your philosophy. Concentrate on keeping up with us instead. He gets up and goes in search of more wood, the others surprised at his cold tone. The rest of the group also begin to prepare their camp. Most gather wood while TOMASZ, the 'quartermaster', makes their meal, and JANUSZ the fire. VOSS keeps an eye on KAZIK who, demonstrating his independence while it's still light, and his desire to contribute, returns with a load of wood, turning back into the forest for more. Others gather wood, and as the light fades, begin to take up positions by the growing fire, roll cigarettes, etc. VOSS looks anxiously for KAZIK. He has not returned. \n63 OMITTED 63 \n64 OMITTED 64 \nA65 EXT. FOREST - DUSK A65 \nKAZIK lost. He moves along a right to left trajectory, i.e. North, heading away for the campsite, his sight beginning to fade with the light. \n65 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 65 \nThe group range out from the fire calling KAZIK's name. VOSS turns to JANUSZ. \nVOSS He has night-blindness. \nRevised 3/17/09 (Cherry) 44A. \n66 EXT. FOREST - NIGHT 66 \nKAZIK stumbling through the whiteout. He stops. Did he hear his name? He moves on, pleased to find by his side the Professor from the mine. \n(CONTTNTTFD ) \n66 CONTINUED: 66 \nKAZIK I thought I was alone! \nPROF. I've been walking with you for some time. \nKAZIK I'll just sit for a minute. The PROF. sits beside him. \nPROF. Not far to go. He points, and KAZIK sees - the Pyramids of Giza, deep inside the fog. \nKAZIK We made it. We really made it. Isn't that something. \n67 EXT. CAMPSITE - DAWN 67 \nThey find KAZIK not a hundred yards from where they camped. The weather has broken, the fog gone. He sits looking toward them, his bare feet stretched out before him, his eyes wide open. On his lips a frozen smile. \n68 EXT. A CAIRN OF STONES - DAY 68 \nThey stand by his grave. \nJANUSZ A free man died here today. Amens are muttered. The group remain by the grave reluctant to leave. All but VALKA who looks about restlessly. \nVALKA Young always die first. The others look at him. \nVALKA (CONT'D) In the camps. He looks at their somber faces. \n(CONTINUED) \n68 CONTINUED: \n74 EXT./INT. CAVE - NIGHT 74 \nSleeping figures by the fire. TOMASZ tosses and turns, muttering in his sleep. JANUSZ is awake as is VALKA who sits close beside him. A whispered conversation - \nVALKA Who will be first? JANUSZ looks at him. \nJANUSZ You mean the first to die? VALKA nods, indicates TOMASZ. \nVALKA I think that sucker, the artist. But better if it was him. He nods toward ZORAN. \nJANUSZ It might be you. VALKA shrugs. \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) Why 'better' if it's Zoran? VALKA squeezes the flesh of his upper arms. \nVALKA More soft. More tender. JANUSZ shakes his head, 'no'. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Mister only gets little fish now. We must have meat, or we die. You're the Pakhan, you've thought of it. We all have. That's why you brought extra people isn't it? For food? An old Urka escape trick. I swear to God you were an Urka in another life. \nJANUSZ We'll get food when we get to Lake Baikal, plenty of fish there. \n(CONTINUED) \n74 CONTINUED: \nVALKA You said we should have seen Lake a week ago. We're lost, Pakhan. JANUSZ stares into the fire as VALKA lays down to sleep. \nA75 LATER, NIGHT \nA75 It is ZORAN's turn on watch and he stands near the entrance to the cave, his blanket about his shoulders, looking out into the still night. Behind him a low growling sound, coming from deep in the cave. He turns, a look of terror on his face. He can see nothing but a dim light deep in the cave where moonlight penetrates through two large holes in the cave roof. He wakes JANUSZ, alerting him to the sound. JANUSZ in turn wakes VALKA, and after taking burning sticks from the fire they walk back inside the vast cave toward the source of the sound, VALKA drawing his knife. \n75 INT. CAVE - NIGHT \nThe dim light shows a wolf-pack growling as they pick at a carcass on the cave floor. They drop their bones and face the intruders, baring their fangs, all now growling. On a signal from JANUSZ they rush the wolves, who run back toward another exit from the cave. MR. SMITH, TOMASZ and VOSS come hurrying to join them, woken by all the barking and shouting. VALKA falls on part of the carcass, cutting off chunks of raw meat. The others do likewise. Wider on the group, down on all fours chewing on the remains of the kill, only JANUSZ stands back, watching them. \nEXT./INT. CAVE - EARLY MORNING 76 \nSome sleep on, others stir, their movements slow and listless. They are near the end. This has been JANUSZ's point of view as he packs a few scraps of food into his pockets and picks up his staff. Those awake stare at him. \nJANUSZ I'll be back in a week - if I find the lake. If not, you're on your own. \nVALKA I come too. \n(CONTINUED) \n76 CONTINUED: 76 \nJANUSZ (shakes his head) I'll travel faster alone. Mr. Smith will be the Pakhan while I'm gone. JANUSZ turns and with a nod of the head 'follow me', to SMITH, he moves off. \n77 EXT. SOME DISTANCE FROM CAMP - DAWN 77 \nNow out of earshot, JANUSZ turns to SMITH. SMITH knows what it's about. \nSMITH I know. Valka. \nJANUSZ Don't let him out of your sight. \nSMITH Good luck. As JANUSZ heads off into the forest. \n78 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY, SIBERIA - DAY 78 \nA magnificent vista - a broad plain sweeping toward a distant line of hills. It's a beautiful clear day and the lone figure of JANUSZ, dwarfed by the landscape, walks steadily Southward. \n79 EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - DUSK 79 \nSheltering from the wind on the leeside of a hill, he takes pine-cones from his pocket, breaks them open and eats the seeds. Then he's up and off again, leaning heavily on his staff. \n80 EXT. A BARREN PLAIN - DAY 80 \nThe weather changes from a clear Spring morning to cold and overcast as gusts of wind whip down from distant slopes. JANUSZ bends into the wind, his pace slowing. He stumbles, sinks to the ground, fighting the desire to let go, to give himself to sleep, and the swift death that will surely follow. His eyes begin to close. Then he sees it. Just ahead of him. The gate. The gate from his vision in the mine. He struggles to his feet, staggers on - \n86-87 OMITTED 86-87 \n88 EXT. A TRACK, LAKESIDE - DAY 88 \nSMITH and VOSS are last in line as they move cautiously along a dirt track. SMITH keeps looking back over his shoulder. \nVOSS What is it? \n(CONTTNTTFD ) \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 54. \n88 CONTINUED: SMITH signals JANUSZ to stop, while holding a finger to his lips for silence. JANUSZ joins him, followed by the others. \nSMITH We're being followed. \nJANUSZ Followed? Where? \nSMITH Fifty yards back. A man on his own. May have seen us - crossed into the trees beside the track. A silence as they consider their options. VALKA draws his knife. \nVOSS No killing. \nVALKA \n(TO VOSS) No? I think you've killed before. You say too many prayers for an innocent man. VOSS looks uneasy. \nSMITH He gives us away, the soldiers will be on us in no time. \nJANUSZ Valka, go back on the other side of the track, then come up behind, in case he makes a run for it. VALKA moves off, gliding through the trees on the left of the track. The others wait a beat, then move into the trees on the right side of the track picking up fallen timber as weapons. JANUSZ is in the lead when in a clearing not fifty paces ahead, a figure steps out from behind a tree. JANUSZ stops, holding up a hand for the others to stay where they are. He stares at the small figure - a young woman. There's a glimpse of a dirty skirt under her coat, a scarf tied loosely about her neck. Wisps of chestnut hair stray out from under a moth-eaten fur hood. She looks frightened and desperate. \n(CONTTNTTFD ) \n88 CONTINUED: (2) 88 From her waif like appearance, it's hard to tell her age - an old thirteen or a young sixteen? The men discreetly drop their irovised weapons. She looks ready to make a run for it on seeing VALKA with his drawn knife. JANUSZ gestures for the others to fall back, as he cautiously approaches, uttering reassuring words. \n89 EXT. PATHWAY, WOODS - LATER - DAY 89 \nThe others sit smoking by the pathway, watching as JANUSZ crosses back from the GIRL to join them. He says something to TOMASZ in Polish. A rapid exchange between them. \nSMITH What? What is it? \nJANUSZ She's Polish. Been following us for several days. \nVALKA What does she want? \nJANUSZ Food? Protection? She's been too afraid to approach us until she was sure we weren't Russians. \nSMITH She wants to travel with us? \nJANUSZ She's on the run, like us. Escaped from a Russian collective farm. \nVALKA I swear to God I know this type - street gypsies, there are thousands like that, less use than a dog! JANUSZ looks back to the GIRL who watches them from the clearing. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Pakhan. Don't do this. \nJANUSZ She's starving. \n(CONTINUED) \n89 CONTINUED: 89 \nSMITH We can't feed ourselves. \nJANUSZ Zoran? \nZORAN Maybe it's kinder to leave her. \nVOSS She's been sent to us. We can't leave her. \nSMITH We have no choice. JANUSZ knows this is true. \n(CNNTTNTTRT) ) \nRevised 3/31/09 (Tan) 58A. \n100 CONTINUED: 100 TOMASZ; In between sketching scenes of his friends at work he skims fat from the pot filled with boiling bones, and lays out strips of meat given to him by VALKA to dry in the sun, part of the jerked meat they will carry as a long term food supply. VALKA; With the 'Wolf' he separates sinews and tendons from the beast, to form much needed bindings for their journey. He also cuts meat for their jerked supply, or to be smoked. \nSMITH; Makes firstly a large bone needle, then later \nmakes repairs in his clothes. ZORAN; After cleaning his teeth with a twig, hangs his suit on a driftwood hanger and is seen brushing it with a branch from a pine tree. TOMASZ teases him and suggests he do something useful. Later this leads to him sorting the boiled bones into various sizes, a sort of accountant of the 'bone-bank'. 'Customers' come to him looking for bones or teeth for various uses. JANUSZ; Works on the reindeer skin. With SMITH's help he stretches it to dry on a driftwood frame. Later, he cuts a piece off and gives it to VOSS for the back-pack. He also works scraping the skin of strands of unwanted meat and fat. IRENA; Sleeps and eats. It is only at dusk one day she seems to come to life and moving to the lakeside washes her clothes and hair. The men try not to stare, and whether their thoughts are carnal or not, whether she reminds them of family or girlfriend, they are all affected by her transformation from boy/urchin, into a young woman when she returns washed, and wearing the dress she has carried rolled-up on her back. \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 59. \n101 EXT. CAMPFIRE, LAKESIDE - NIGHT 101 \nSMITH and JANUSZ some distance from the campsite collecting wood. By the fire ZORAN leads the 'Survivors Band'. He has them drumming on logs, tapping sticks, harmonizing, amid much laughter. JANUSZ watches IRENA. Then he turns to SMITH. \nJANUSZ She's educated. Speaks good English. And French. \nSMITH That right. \nJANUSZ You don't like her, do you? \nSMITH Speak to Valka about her. He doesn't even think she's Polish. \nJANUSZ I did speak to him. And the others. They agree she comes with us. \nSMITH It's decided then? \nJANUSZ You disagree. \nSMITH Apart from food she'll slow us down. There's no room for sentimentality. You know that. \n(CONTTNT7FD ) \n101 CONTINUED: \nAnd he turns, moving back to the fire with his load of wood. \n102 EXT. PATHWAY, WOODS - DAY 102 \nRefreshed and revived and laden with their supplies from the deer, they make their way along a narrow dirt track by the lake. IRENA is aware that the main opposition to her joining with them comes from VALKA and SMITH. SMITH she knows is the more important, and she tries to keep up with him. Occasionally catching his eye, she tries to charm him with a coquettish smile beyond her years. \n103 EXT. RIVER/LAKE - DAY \nA river flowing into the lake presents an obstacle. They walk along the edge to where the river begins to narrow, but here it's still frozen, and a quick test with JANUSZ's staff shows it to be too thin to take their weight. They look upstream - a distant figure of a man, a hunter possibly, a shotgun over his shoulder, on their side of the bank. There's clearly no choice but to swim for it. They make hasty preparations, removing outer clothing, except shirts and trousers, tying their boots about their necks. IRENA watches. \nSMITH Can you swim? \nIRENA Yes, Mister. \nSMITH You wouldn't lie to me? \nIRENA I'm not lying, Comrade. That was a slip of the tongue, and SMITH is made uneasy by it. \nSMITH And don't call me, 'comrade'. With a shout the group plunge into the icy water, swimming one-handed, their packs held above water level in the other. It's only when they reach the other side they realize IRENA is still on the opposite bank. The others urge her to swim across. She hesitates a moment then runs upstream to where the river is frozen. \n(CNNTTNTTFTD ) \n103 CONTINUED: 103 They watch in astonishment as in a series of leaps and bounds she's out on the ice heading for the opposite bank. Ice cracks beneath her feet and a couple of times it seems she'll fall in, but with a last great leap over a section of free-flowing water she makes it to the other side, hurrying down to join the others a broad smile on her face. She looks defiantly at SMITH. JANUSZ is worried about the man having seen them, and urges them to follow him into the tree-line. \n104-105 OMITTED 104-105 \nA106 EXT. FOREST, A SHORT TIME LATER - DAY A106 \nThey scramble up a steep, forested slope, with occasional backward glances to see if the hunter is following. There's no sign of him. \n106 EXT. LAKESIDE - DAY 106 \nSome time later the group, still a little damp, walk by the lake. IRENA walks beside SMITH whose long strides force her to jog occasionally to keep up. They swat at mosquitoes as they walk. \nThe group make their way uphill and around the town. \nA110 EXT.TOWN, LAKESIDE - NIGHT A110 \nTheir P.O.V. down to the few lights of the town and the lake glimmering in the moonlight. From the direction of the town - the sound of a dog barking in an agitated fashion. \nAB110 EXT. HILLS BEHIND VILLAGE, SAME TIME - NIGHT AB110 \nSMITH joins JANUSZ. Off his expression: \nSMITH \n(TO JANUSZ) What is it? What's wrong? \nJANUSZ Where's Valka? \nSMITH He was behind Zoran. \nJANUSZ \n(TO ZORAN) Didn't you watch Valka? \nZORAN I'm not his keeper. \nJANUSZ Damn him! He looks back down to the town. \n110 EXT. THE GROUNDS OF A HOUSE, VILLAGE - NIGHT 110 \nA dim light through a side window - the glimpse of a woman crossing through frame, followed shortly after by the weathered face of a fisherman. He's heard something. He crosses to the window, peers out into the darkness. The moment he turns away the camera moves on around the side to the rear of the building, past a rabbit in a cage. VALKA's shoulder comes into frame as he edges his way toward the back door, passing the sightless skull of a dried fish swinging from a cord under the eaves. He reaches for the door-handle, opens it, and slips silently inside. A111 EXT. TOWN, LAKESIDE - NIGHT Alll A view along a road to the town. (P.O.V. now on the opposite side of town to that seen earlier.) \n111 EXT.TREES, ROADSIDE - NIGHT 111 \nTheabove P.O.V. is that of the group waiting for VALKA. \nTheysit by the roadside looking toward the town. They \nswatat a cloud of mosquitoes. \nSMITH He could turn us in for the bounty. \nJANUSZ And risk arrest? \nSMITH He'd bribe his way out of it. \nJANUSZ \n(TO IRENA) Would he do that? \nIRENA He might. \nZORAN It's an opportunity. We're rid of him. \nTOMASZ We don't need his knife. We can make one from deer bone. \nZORAN Come on! Let's go! \n(CONTTNTTRD ) \n111 CONTINUED: A movement behind them, they turn as VALKA steps out from behind a tree. He stares back at them a crooked grin on his face. \nVALKA So. SMITH moves swiftly, grabs him by his collar and spins him into the tree. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Hey, easy cowboy! \nSMITH Could have got us all killed. \nVALKA You tear my coat \nSMITH Fool! He releases him and VALKA staggers back, reaching down to a bulging sack. He tips out the contents - various foodstuffs including a freshly killed rabbit and a bottle of vodka. \n(A WHISPER) No mosquitos. The others unsure of his meaning. \nZORAN (CONT'D) They have no mosquitos! \n115 EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS, LAKESIDE - DAY/DUSK 115 \nThe group have by now a walking routine which they rarely vary, always occupying the same positions in extended line. JANUSZ as navigator in the lead, SMITH generally bringing up the rear. IRENA is the exception - varying her place, now with one, now with another. They don't talk much to each other as they walk but they do talk with her. She has the knack of getting anyone to talk. No doubt a skill learnt in her life on the streets. \n116 EXT. FOREST NEAR THE ROAD - DAY 116 \nA small fire burns as TOMASZ cooks a fish stolen by VALKA. The smoke from the fire is not enough to alleviate the mosquito problem and the group swat in miserable silence. Suddenly SMITH throws dirt on the fire, suffocating it with his jacket. He points to the road. \n117 EXT. ROAD - DAY 117 \nFrom their point of view a fisherman in his fifties, a basket in a sling on his back, walks abreast of them on the track. \n118 EXT. FOREST - DAY 118 \nAs he passes, ZORAN speaks in a whisper to JANUSZ. \nZORAN There it is! Again! JANUSZ mystified. \nZORAN (CONT'D) Look at him. JANUSZ stares again at the man. \nZORAN (CONT'D) No mosquitos! ZORAN is up and off before anyone can stop him. They watch in appalled silence as he approaches and speaks to the man, who regards this stranger appearing from the forest with some suspicion. ZORAN does a kind of crazy dance, talking all the while. \n(CNNTTNTTED ) \nRevised 4/23/09 (Buff) 70. \n118 CONTINUED: 118 Soon the man is laughing, and putting down his bag and gun he takes something from around his neck and places it on ZORAN's neck. A few more words, and more laughter, then with a handshake ZORAN heads back into the forest, the man continuing on his way. ZORAN rejoins them, holding up the gift from the old man - strands of intertwined bark. \nZORAN (CONT'D) Mosquito repellent! And I have the formula! \n119 EXT. ROAD - DAY 119 \nLATER. They all wear necklaces of the entwined bark and are mosquito free. ZORAN is the hero of the hour. \nTOMASZ But what did you say to him? \nZORAN That I was an escaped convict who was being plagued by mosquitos. As they round a bend and disappear from sight, TOMASZ's voice drifts back. \nTOMASZ (V.O.) Very funny. But what did you really say? \nA120 LAKE'S END, SIBERIA - DAY A120 JANUSZ scoops up a handful of water where it laps a beach. It's a symbolic end to their lake trek, and they turn and walk on, the lake behind them. \n120 EXT. A FIELD, SIBERIA - DAY 120 \nIn the far distance a large town dominated by a collection of smoke stacks, belching out columns of smoke into the sky, as the group hurry across open ground to the shelter of the forest. \nA121 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY A121 \nA rustic cart passes by. After it has gone the fugitives emerge from concealment and resume their journey. \nRevised 4/23/09 (Buff) 70aA. \nAB121 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY AB121 \nVOSS, ZORAN and TOMASZ talk of their pre-Gulag days with \nIRENA. \nVOSS A small stone church in a little village. Very peaceful. I grew up in that village. Then, \nZORAN I went on business. Once a year - government clients of course! Then, \nTOMASZ .layers of very fine pastry, so when you bite there is a lightness, a delicacy - it should almost melt in the mouth. \n121 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY - DAY 121 \nZORAN Go over the Himalayas? How? On a magic carpet? A silence as they contemplate the massive distances stretching ahead of them. \nAB136 EXT. ABANDONED STONE BUILDING, MONGOLIA - DAWN AB136 \nIn the middle of an empty plain a small circular stone ruin. \n136 INT. RUIN - DAWN 136 \nSleeping figures. A gentle tip-tapping sound. VOSS opens his eyes. Staring back at him from the doorway, half a dozen sheep. He nudges TOMASZ who wakes sleepily, takes his eye-line. Carefully, slowly, they rise, VOSS drawing his deer-bone knife. Then they move. The sheep retreat, bumping into each other, and outside the chase is on. TOMASZ tackles a ewe and VOSS approaches with a knife, but JANUSZ is behind him, grabs his arm. \nJANUSZ No! Andrejs, no! VOSS tries to free his arm. \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) Don't kill it! \nTOMASZ Why not? We're hungry! \nJANUSZ You want the locals after us too? They break into Polish, a blazing argument, months of pent up frustration. VOSS picks up the sheep and carries it inside the ruin. \n137 INT. RUIN, LATER - DAY 137 \nMilk squirting into their aluminium bowl as VOSS expertly milks the ewe, IRENA and ZORAN holding it steady. \n138 EXT. STEPPE - DAY 138 \nThe sun is blazing as they cross through a sea of grass, hills rising in the distance like islands. TOMASZ and ZORAN play a long distance walker's game - each in turn kicking a rock out ahead, continually passing it from one to the other. JANUSZ and SMITH look to the hills surrounding them as they walk. \nJANUSZ You feel it? \nSMITH Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \n138 CONTINUED: 138 \nIRENA Feel what? \nJANUSZ We're being watched. IRENA uneasy, squints in the direction of the hills. And you can feel it. Like a John Ford western there's a sense of being in Indian territory, of their every move watched by unseen eyes. \nA139 EXT. BUDDHIST TEMPLE - DAY A139 \nA distant view of a temple complex at the base of low hills. \nAB139 EXT. STEPPE - DAY AB139 \nThe above has been pointed out by VOSS to the group, and they decide to make their way to the temple, in the hope of getting food. \n139 EXT. ABANDONED TEMPLE COMPLEX, STEPPES - DAY 139 \nWithin a walled compound they wander between a series of recently abandoned Buddhist temples and out-buildings. By the size of the compound, several hundred monks may have lived here. Everywhere are signs of violence - doors hang from hinges, and a large statue of Buddha lies smashed in a courtyard. JANUSZ points to a line of bullet impacts, stitched across a wall. \n140 INT. TEMPLE - DAY 140 \nThere are bloodstains on the floor, and the wind howling about the building makes a haunting accompaniment. IRENA and VOSS are alone inside. \nIRENA What happened here? \nVOSS The same as happened in Russia. Churches closed, priests shot or taken to camps, religion banned. They came to my church, in Latvia. Destroyed everything, declared it a 'museum'. Later that night, there was a lone guard. A boy. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n140 CONTINUED: 140 \nVOSS (CONT-D) I strangled him until his eyes popped right out of his head. Valka knew somehow. Knew I'd killed in cold blood. He bows his head. IRENA looks up at him, and they stand together in silence, but for the moaning wind. \n141 EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - DAY 141 \nAs they head South, each is lost in their own thoughts when seemingly out of nowhere a half-dozen Mongolian horsemen are galloping toward them. The horsemen circle them, far from friendly looks on their faces. They wear the traditional costume of Steppe nomads and range in age from a man in his seventies down to a six-year-old boy. The OLD MAN pulls up his horse in front of SMITH, figuring as he's the oldest he'll also be the leader. The groups stare at each other. The OLD MAN speaks in Russian, a rough guttural accent. \n146 CONTINUED: 146 They look back to the disappearing horseman before scrambling down the rocky slope. \nA147 EXT. GOBI DESERT - DAY A147 \nThe group crossing into the heart of the Gobi. \n147 EXT. GOBI DESERT, LATER - DAY 147 \nVOSS is the first to see it - a vast glittering lake. They hurry toward it. \n148 LATER, 148 The lake leads them on, but appears no closer. \n149 LATER STILL, 149 JANUSZ has taken a reading of the sun, using his stick method. He points out their direction - it is away from the beckoning lake. \nVOSS Janusz! JANUSZ hesitates, looks at VOSS who holds up their water- bag. \nVOSS (CONT'D.) (CONT'D) We should go to the lake. Water is getting low. \nJANUSZ What lake? It's a mirage. He plods on, away from the shimmering vision. There's little the others can do but trust JANUSZ, and slowly they follow. \n150 EXT. THE GOBI - MIDDAY/DUSK 150 \nThe sun is directly above, the land shimmering with heat The group have stuck their sticks in the ground and draped their jackets over them, making a sunshade they SHELTER under. \nRevised 3/16/09 (Salmon) 85. \n151 LATER, 151 The sun has dropped, casting shadows. JANUSZ rises from the shelter and calls for the others to continue. \n152 EXT. THE GOBI - ANOTHER DAY 152 \nThe figures, tiny in the surrounding desert, walk on, JANUSZ in the lead needing to constantly slow down to allow the others to catch up. \nA153 EXT. THE GOBI - SAME DAY A153 \nThe group hesitate on hearing a distant roaring sound up ahead. Nothing on the horizon. Then they are hit by a fierce wind, as toward them rolls a vast cloud of sand. They drop to the ground instinctively, and huddled together throw blankets around their shoulders and over their heads, as they are engulfed in the choking sand. LATER, they emerge from their own 'dune', and shaking themselves down they resume their journey southward. \n153 EXT. THE GOBI - NIGHT 153 \nThe temperature has dropped to freezing and they huddle by a fire, picking sand out of their small ration of food. \nZORAN I'm too tired to sleep. \nTOMASZ Why not keep walking? \nZORAN I'm for that, if we can wake Andrejs. They look to where VOSS sleeps. \nZORAN (CONT'D) He can sleep anywhere, any time. How does he do it? \nSMITH \n(TO JANUSZ) Can you plot your way by the stars? \n(CONTTNTTFD ) \nRevised 3/16/09 (Salmon) 85A. \n153 CONTINUED: 153 \nJANUSZ (Nods.) Yes, but haven't you noticed? He points upward to the low clouds obscuring the stars. \nSMITH What about water? \nJANUSZ What about it? \nF CNNTTNTTFT)1 \n153 CONTINUED: 153 \nSMITH I don't see any. I'm trying to remember my school geography but I seem to recall the Gobi Desert somewhere in Southern Mongolia. JANUSZ begins scooping out a hole in the pebbly ground. It's funnel-shaped, narrow at the base. The others watch as he lines the sides with dried deerskin, placing their cooking pot in the base. \n174 EXT. GOBI - DAWN 174 \nThey walk on, ZORAN carefully carrying the partly filled bowl of water. IRENA seems refreshed, but JANUSZ and SMITH walk beside her, watching her every step. \nIRENA I can walk alright if I can lean a little on you. They each lightly lay a hand on her elbow. \n175 EXT. GOBI - LATER - DAY 175 \nIRENA starts to fall forward, they steady her, and she walks on for a bit before slumping forward, and falling to her knees. SMITH too falls with exhaustion. VOSS hurries back to them. \nJANUSZ Can you go on? \nIRENA I think so. But what about Mr. Smith? SMITH struggling for breath is back on his feet, waving them on. VOSS and JANUSZ each put an arm about her and half-carrying, half-dragging her, they set off again but it's no use, she's lost all her strength. \nVOSS I'm going to carry her. \n(CONTINUED) \n178 EXT. GOBI DESERT - DAY 178 \nA lizard, in close up, listens to an approaching sound. As the volume builds he runs for his life. A beetle too, has heard it and burrows into the sand as a foot in a battered moccasin looms large in frame. We follow the foot a few staggering steps, then a blur, as a body falls through frame, ending in a close-up of TOMASZ, his breath coming in short gasps. \n179 EXT. WIDER, GOBI DESERT - DAY 179 \nThe five figures, small in frame, TOMASZ the last in line, down on his knees. He raises a hand, hasn't the strength to call out. Then one of the figures sees him, calls to the others. CLOSE on TOMASZ. He pulls the leg of his trousers up with difficulty - the tell-tale swelling of the ankles, just as with IRENA. As JANUSZ approaches he quickly covers his legs and staggers to his feet. JANUSZ steadies him, and taking his arm they continue. \n180 EXT. DUNES, GOBI DESERT - DAY 180 \nAs they walk the landscape changes from the endless scrubby plain to sweeping sand dunes. The nature of the terrain makes the going slower and they move forward on the edge of exhaustion. In a curious freak of Nature the wind whips across the top of the dunes creating an eerie singing sound. Ahead, and across their path a massive dune - no way forward but over it. TOMASZ looks up, staring in horror - \nTOMASZ'S HALLUCINATION: The dune is moving, rising up, higher and higher, like a massive sand wave. Back on TOMASZ. He collapses, unconscious. \n181 EXT. BASE OF THE GREAT DUNE, GOBI - TWILIGHT 181 \nAn eerie, ghostly twilight, the group all sitting together in a rough circle around TOMASZ. He seems to revive as he passes around sketches he's made during their imprisonment and escape. \n(CONTINUED) \n181 CONTINUED: 181 It's an almost cheerful scene, like a traveller showing happy snaps taken on holiday. \nVOSS I like this one. When did you do that? He holds up a sketch of KAZIK, showing him examining one of his battered shoes. \nTOMASZ On the train. Poor Kazik, always the trouble with his feet. ZORAN holds up a drawing of himself. \nZORAN Who's this? \nTOMASZ You. ZORAN looks at it again genuinely shocked. \nZORAN My father maybe, but is that how I look now? A chuckle from the others. SMITH stares at a sketch of IRENA. \nSMITH You caught her smile. SMITH passes the sketch to JANUSZ as TOMASZ lays back down, a smile on his face. He looks up at the stars. He knows he's dying and has accepted the fact. This in turn has given strength to his friends, and between them all is a feeling of love and a kind of peace. \n182 EXT. BASE OF THE GREAT DUNE, GOBI - DAWN 182 \nThey've tied his pencil to a length of hide, and hung it from the top of the cross over his grave. A faint breath of morning breeze sets it swinging like a pendulum, the others long gone. \n183 EXT. DUNES - DAY 183 \nAs they stagger on JANUSZ has moved well out in front, when he stumbles and falls. Then he sees it, just out ahead, and he begins crawling toward it. \n(CONTINUED) \n183 CONTINUED: 183 \nJANUSZ'S MIRAGE - DAY: It's the hedge and gate from his vision. Behind the hedge the hint of a roof. Through the gate can be seen the path to the front door. \n184 EXT. DUNES - DAY 184 \nJANUSZ crawling faster now, when ZORAN appears beside him. \nRevised 2/25/09 (Pink) 103. \n197 CONTINUED: 197 JANUSZ helps SMITH sit up, feeding him a small piece of meat. SMITH waves him away, sinking back to the ground too tired to eat. \nVOSS Kind of like chicken. \nZORAN Yeah, a long black poisonous chicken with no legs. \nJANUSZ You know Valka talked of eating each other? In Siberia? \nZORAN He did? Would you have eaten me? \nJANUSZ Probably. \nZORAN I would never have eaten you - too stringy and bitter, I'd rather eat snake. VOSS nearly chokes on something, reaches into his mouth, pulls out a tooth. \nJANUSZ Scurvy. \n198 OMITTED 198 \n199 EXT. CAMPSITE - NIGHT 199 \nThe fire burns low, VOSS and ZORAN sleep. SMITH wakes from time to time and JANUSZ forces him to eat and drink. SMITH is deathly pale, his life ebbing away. He speaks in short, croaky stabs, every breath an effort. \nSMITH It can kill you, remember? JANUSZ puzzled. \nSMITH (CONT'D) 'Kindness'. JANUSZ tries to force more water on him but SMITH waives him away. \n199 CONTINUED: 199 \nSMITH (CONT'D) How long can you survive on snakes and mud? You should leave me, but you can't can you? You're a fool. I'd leave you. He lays back down. JANUSZ studies his face, pain and suffering etched in sharp lines. \nJANUSZ Mister? \nSMITH What? \nJANUSZ I mightn't know youur first name, but I know your son's name. SMITH stares at him. \nSMITH Irena told you. JANUSZ nods. \nJANUSZ Can I say his name? Nothing from SMITH. \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) 'David'. \nSMITH Saying his name on't bring him back. He struggles onto his elbow, staring intently at JANUSZ, an ironic smile on his lips. \nSMITH (CONT'D) You trying to give me the will to live? That it? Stop me giving up? \nJANUSZ Are you giving up? \nSMITH In the camps, some saw death as 'freedom'. \n(CONTINUED) \nRevised 3/16/09 ( Salmon) 105. \n199 CONTINUED: ( 2) 199 \nJANUSZ So why didn't you kill yourself? \nSMITH Survival was a kind of protest. JANUSZ makes him take a little water. \nSMITH (CONT'D) Now being alive is my punishment. \nJANUSZ Punishment for what? \nSMITH I brought David to Russia didn't \nI? \n", "test1_input": "Revised 3/16/09 (Salmon) 72A. \n126 CONTINUED: 126 \nVALKA A cross for your tombstone. \n(CNNTTNTTFT)1 \n126 CONTINUED: (2) TOMASZ surprised at his tone. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Why should you care what I'm making? The evening is hot and VALKA has his shirt open, the tattooed portraits of Lenin and Stalin on his chest appear and disappear in the folds of his shirt. This amuses ZORAN. \nZORAN Valka? \nVALKA What? \nZORAN Why do you have arseholes tattooed on your chest? VALKA stops. Stares back. \nZORAN (CONT'D) Shouldn't they be on your arse so you sit on them every time you take a shit? \nVALKA You think it's funny? They are great men. ZORAN laughs. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Watch your eyes, crowbait! He makes a 'V' with his fingers followed by a short stabbing motion. ZORAN reels back. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Don't you know what 'Stalin' means funny man? Man-of-Steel. He takes from rich and gives to poor. \nZORAN Sure he does. Then he puts both of them in a camp for twenty-five years. VALKA goes back to his carving. \nA127 EXT. RAILWAY TRACKS - NIGHT A127 \nJANUSZ stands on the tracks lookingdownthelinetoa cutting where the track disappearsaroundabend.The sound of an approaching train, a dim light already reflected on the side of the cutting. He turns and looks toward the trees where the others are approaching down a wooded hillside. He hurries toward them, urging them to take cover in the bracken beside the track. SMITH points out a glowing red light further down the track from the approaching train. \nAB127 EXT. RAILWAY TRACK - NIGHT AB127 \nThe train thunders into the cutting with a squeal of breaks as the driver sights the red light on the track ahead, and the train slows to a stop. \n127 EXT. BESIDE THE TRACK - NIGHT 127 \nClose on the faces of the escapees as they look up to the carriages stopped in front of them. They are cattle- cars, but its soon apparent their cargo is human. From the high windows, hands can be seen clutching the bars. From inside a communal groaning and sighing. Voices, female voices, cry out for water, and on the agonized faces of the fugitives a mixture of pain and empathy. Then the train seems to sigh, like a great beast, and from beneath the carriages flow streams of blood and urine. As the distant light turns green the train slowly moves forward, and as it does so, letters and notes drop to the tracks from the barred windows. After it is gone they scramble over the tracks into the woods on the other side, all but VOSS. He is picking up as many of the notes and letters as he can. \nJANUSZ (V.O.) Andrejs, for God's sake! VOSS slowly crosses the tracks, and disappears into the brush. \n128 EXT. BRUSH, TRACKSIDE - NIGHT 128 \nVOSS, overwhelmed with emotion sits down, examining the letters and notes in his hand. JANUSZ hurries back for him. \n(CONTINUED) \n128 CONTINUED: 128 \nJANUSZ \n(WHISPERS) Come on! But VOSS doesn't move. JANUSZ sits beside him, and VOSS passes him a sample of the prisoners' pathetic messages - some scrawled on the back of photographs. They are mostly names and addresses, pleas for someone to mail or inform relatives of what happened to them - some have even clipped a few bank-notes to pay for postage. \n129 OMITTED 129 \n130 EXT. RUSSO-MONGOLIAN BORDER, COUNTRYSIDE - DAWN 130 \nTall striped posts at intervals, strung with rusted wire - beyond, a dirt road and distant fields. From a concealed position in the nearby trees they carefully watch for signs of a patrol. JANUSZ goes first, passing easily through the sagging fence. ZORAN calls to him. \nZORAN \n(SHOUTS) What's it like in Mongolia? JANUSZ holds up a hand - 'Keep your voice down'. ZORAN crawls through the wire followed by the others. \nZORAN (CONT'D) I love Mongolia. \nSMITH Love it later. We need to get as far from this border as possible. ZORAN faces Russia and as if bowing at the end of a performance. \nZORAN Thank you Mother Russia for your hospitality! I definitely will not be coming back! It's only then that we notice that VALKA has not crossed through. He stands staring at them from the Soviet side. It's clear he's going no further. JANUSZ crosses back to him, and they talk through the wire. \n", "test1_true": "130 CONTINUED: 130 \nJANUSZ They'll catch you if you stay, you know that. \nVALKA \n(SHRUGS) Prison is o.k. Debt is bad. But there are many prisons. They don't find me. They stand a moment, watching the others moving toward a line of trees. \nJANUSZ No, America? \nVALKA It's not for me - 'Freedom'. Wouldn't know what to do with it, I swear to God. He places his hand on the wooden hilt of his knife, sticking out of his waistband. \nVALKA (CONT'D) So we must say goodbye, my Wolf and me. JANUSZ glances at the knife. \nVALKA (CONT'D) You don't need him any more. \nJANUSZ Good luck, Valka. \nVALKA Good luck, Pakhan. And he turns and walks away. JANUSZ walks toward the distant group and by the time he looks back, VALKA is gone. \n131 EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE - DAY 131 \nA vast plain stretches to distant snow-capped peaks. Dotted on the hills the Gers - circular tent-like structures, home to the nomadic Mongolians. In the distance walk the band of survivors, strung out in a line abreast. Their voices drift back - snatches of conversation., and laughter. \n132 OMITTED 132 \n133 EXT. ROAD - DAY 133 \nThe travellers striding confidently down the dirt road. Around a bend, a decorative archway over the road, a town visible a few miles further on. They stop in their tracks. On one side of the timber structure a portrait of Josef Stalin. On the other the local Mongolian leader, a red star on his military cap. In the centre, the hammer and sickle over a painting of a brown hand shaking a white one. Small flags of both nations flap ominously. CLOSE on the stunned faces of the fugitives. \nVOSS It's here too. \nSMITH This changes everything. IRENA looks at the grassy plains all about them. \nIRENA Nowhere to hide. \n134-135 OMITTED 134-135 \nA136 EXT. MONGOLIAN STEPPE, LATER - DAY A136 \nThe group walk toward a distant line of hills, feeling very exposed to any watching eyes. \nZORAN How far is China? \nJANUSZ Five, six hundred kilometers. ZORAN groans. \nIRENA Is China free? \nSMITH There's a war on with the Japanese, I know that much. \nVOSS After China is Tibet. Religious people. Buddhists. \n(CNNTTNTTFD ) \nA136 CONTINUED: A136 \nJANUSZ But isn't Tibet closed to foreigners? I remember reading that. \nVOSS Their religion would compel them to shelter us. We could go to Lhasa, the capital. \nZORAN We break out of one 'closed country' and now we plan to break into another? I like 'open' countries. TOMASZ and JANUSZ exchange a few excited words in Polish. IRENA translates. \nIRENA They say we could go beyond Tibet. Over the mountains. To India. \nZORAN What mountains? \nSMITH (shakes his head) The Himalayas. \nTOMASZ We could join the British Army. First fight Nazis then Russians! \n", "test2_input": "CLOSER AGAIN. A BIRD RISES INTO THE SKY FROM THE NOW \nMORE SOLID TREES. Back on ZORAN. \nZORAN Mirages don't have birds! Wider, and they're running, running with the last of their precious energy. \n161 EXT. WELL - DAY 161 \nA clump of straggly tortured trees surround a desert well - a low square of ancient stones. They sprawl by the well, SMITH reaching down inside with their bowl to bring up a scoop of crystal clear water. It's passed around rapidly. \nSMITH Just a little. Don't fill yourselves. More scoops follow in quick succession, enough to splash hands and faces. VOSS calls from a few yards away. \nVOSS Fire. Coals are still warm. SMITH and JANUSZ join him, examining the ground about the fire. \nSMITH Lots of tracks. Nomads? \nVOSS Maybe others will come? \nTOMASZ Over here! The remains of a meal! There's still meat on the bones! He points to the cooked remains of some animal. Using VOSS's deer-bone knife he scrapes meat from the bones, others just attacking any bone they find. \n(CONTINUED) \n161 CONTINUED: 161 \nJANUSZ Don't eat it all! He manages to save at least half of the meat, wrapping it in a cloth, and putting it in VOSS's backpack. \n162 EXT. WELL, LATER - DAY 162 \nThey lie stretched out under the shade of the trees dozing, and every now and then going back to the well to drink or just to lay their hands in the cool water. \n163 EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 163 \nIRENA sleeps while the men discuss their situation in hushed tones. \nTOMASZ At least we have water here. \nJANUSZ But no food. \nVOSS Other nomads will come. Water their flocks. \nJANUSZ When? Next week? Next month? \nZORAN We could wait a few days, at least. \nJANUSZ Without food, we'll only get weaker. Maybe too weak to travel. \nTOMASZ These last days - I don't know that I could go through that again. \nVOSS (looks at the water) It was a miracle finding this. Can we count on another? \nTOMASZ I say we stay. \n(CONTINUED) \n163 CONTINUED: 163 They look to SMITH. He looks up to find them watching him. \nSMITH What are you looking at me for? Ask Janusz. He's already made up his mind for us, haven't you, Janusz? JANUSZ says nothing. \n164 EXT.WELL - DAWN 164 \nThey all take a last drink from the well, then pour water over their faces and clothes. VOSS fills the skin water- bag, then ZORAN fills their cooking bowl to the brim. Steamis rising from their damp clothing when they set off. ZORAN walking on tip-toe, anxiousnot to spill a dropfrom the bowl in his outstretchedhand. \n165 EXT.GOBI DESERT - DAY 165 \nClose on TOMASZ as he looks back over his shoulder to \nSEE: \nTHE WELL, STILL NOT MORE THAN 500 YARDS BEHIND. \n", "test2_true": "THE WELL, NOW UP TO HALF A MILE BEHIND AND LOOKING LESS \nREAL IN THE SHIMMERING HEAT. \n167 BRIEF TIME LAPSE: 167 Close on VOSS, he shades his eyes to see: \nTHE WELL IS BELOW THE HORIZON NOW, AND ALL THAT CAN BE \nSEEN IS THE ENDLESS FLATNESS, THE SAME EMPTINESS THAT \nSTRETCHES OUT BEFORE THEM. \n168 EXT. GOBI, DESERT - TIMELAPSE - DAY 168 \nThey walk in a desert void. There are no features, no distant hills, no growth of any kind. It is an emptiness, the only sound that of their footsteps and their labored breathing. \n(CONTINUED) \n168 CONTINUED: 168 All the while their water supply is dwindling - water from ZORAN's bowl long gone, the goat-skin water-bag no longer sloshes, but has to be squeezed to get out even a mouthful. \n169 EXT. GOBI - DUSK 169 \nJANUSZ hands out small portions of the scavenged meat from the waterhole. All of them are subject to cramps, the result of the lack of water, and from time to time they are seen reacting to a sudden bolt of pain, attempting to stretch against it, or massage the limb out of its paralysis. \n170 LATER, SAME CAMPSITE - NIGHT 170 SMITH and JANUSZ collect more dried camel dung for the fire. SMITH looks to where the others sit. \nSMITH We're in trouble. \nJANUSZ I know that, but they mustn't. \nSMITH They know. \nJANUSZ You can survive a month or more without food, but water? \nSMITH Days? \nJANUSZ Maybe two days, maybe less in this heat. \nSMITH What about what we're getting from condensation? \nJANUSZ It's the only thing keeping us alive. But for how long? \nSMITH Can you get us back to the waterhole? \n(CONTINUED) \n172 EXT. GOBI - LATER - DAY 172 \nAs they walk VOSS picks up a pebble, holds it up to show ZORAN who walks behind him. \nVOSS When we worked the fields, during the hot summers, we used to suck on small stones like these. Don't know why but it made us feel less thirsty. ZORANpicks up a pebble. \nZORAN We've eaten just about everything else. \nVOSS You don't eat it, just suck on it. At this moment IRENA falls again, her knees buckling and her face pitching into the sand in almost one movement. They turn her over again, wiping the sand from her nose and mouth. SMITH makes a shelter over her with their sticks and jackets. She lies with her eyes closed, her breathing coming in harsh gasps. Both legs are now swollen to the knees. He touches the swelling and the marks his fingers make remain for some seconds. \nVOSS (CONT'D) Sunstroke? IRENA wakes. \nIRENA I'm becoming a nuisance. She looks down at her legs. \nJANUSZ Do they hurt you? \nIRENA No, not at all. They must be swelling because I've walked so far. Don't you think, Mister? SMITH nods reassuringly then quickly turns away, a look of deep anguish passing across his face. \n173 EXT. GOBI - NIGHT 173 \nThe others keep watch over her as she sleeps. SMITH passes around a splash of water in the cup. They all refuse it. \nZORAN Save it for Irena. We've got our pebbles. And he pops one in his mouth, makes out it's delicious and soothing. In the now familiar ritual they scoop out holes in the sand, lining them with their jackets, hopeful of collecting a little moisture overnight. \n", "test3_input": "SHEPHERD \n(POINTING DOWN) Lhasa LHA-SA! Then, indicating 'over' the mountains - \nSHEPHERD (CONT'D) \nIN-DI-A! In dumb-show, he mines that the mountains would be very cold. \n212 EXT. SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 212 \nThree horses arrive at the door of the lonely hut and its associated outbuildings. THE SHEPHERD dismounts and with much bowing opens the door for two other Tibetans who follow. One is a LPMA, the other a local OFFICIAL. They stoop as they enter - a glimpse inside to where the four survivors sit at a table, surrounded by bowls and plates of food. \n213 INT. SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 213 \nThe LAMA and the OFFICIAL sit opposite the group. Tea is served. The official speaks English with difficulty, and as in Mongolia, he addresses the elder of the group - MR. \nSMITH. \nOFFICIAL India? Yes. There is the track to Sikkim, over the mountains. Many people go there. \nSMITH And food? \nOFFICIAL Small villages there. They give food. Wood for fire. Yes, but you don't go now. CLOSE on JANUSZ, intensely following the conversation. \n(CONTINUED) \n213 CONTINUED: 213 \nJANUSZ Why can't we go now? \nOFFICIAL If big snow come - very difficult. You wait here until Spring. This family keep you. He confers with the LAMA. \nJANUSZ \n(TO SMITH) That's three months. \nOFFICIAL (indicates the LAMA) He go to Lhasa. Get permission for to stay. Only to Spring. Not possible foreigners stay Tibet. SMITH bows his head, mutters thanks, all of the group doing likewise. \n214 INT. STABLES, SHEPHERD'S HUT - NIGHT 214 \nTHE SHEPHERD has seen JANUSZ, ZORAN and VOSS to their quarters. He passes VOSS a battered oil-lamp and retires with much bowing. They settle on the straw covered floor, laying out their heavy wool fleeces and blankets given to them by the shepherd's wife. \nZORAN Well, we can't cross in Winter. \nJANUSZ He said it was 'difficult'. SMITH comes in, and they make room for him in the cramped space. \nZORAN I'm going to sleep 'till Spring. Like a bear in a cave. What about you, Mister? SMITH settles with his back to the wall, draws up his sheepskin. \nSMITH I'm going to Lhasa. The others are stunned by this. \n(CONTINUED) \n214 CONTINUED: 214 \nSMITH (CONT'D) The Lama has a contact - maybe get me out through China. There's a U.S. military mission there. They don't like it. A feeling he's deserting them, breaking up the team. \nZORAN 'Looking after number one.' Isn't that what Americans say? \nSMITH Zoran? ZORAN eventually looks at him. \nSMITH (CONT'D) We escaped. We made it. VOSS blows out the lamp. Silvery moonlight from a small window. \nZORAN He's right. I just realized it. \nVOSS Realized what? \nZORAN Apart from a few mountains, we're there. We made it. \nVOSS Not all of us. \n", "test3_true": "ZORAN (CONT'D) What will you do, Mister? When you get home. \nSMITH 'Home'? \nZ ORAN Build metros? \nSMITH Might drift for a while. \n(CONTINUED) \n214 CONTINUED: (2) \nZORAN \n(LAUGHS) Haven't you had enough of that? CLOSE on JANUSZ, hardly listening, his thoughts elsewhere. Their late-night conversation drifts over him. \nVOSS I will fight. First Germans, then Russians. \nZORAN Then re-build your church? \nVOSS I will die fighting. This statement has an oddly prophetic sound. JANUSZ look across at him. \nZORAN I'm going to get Tomasz's pictures to a newspaper, or get them published somehow. Then I'm going to cook his chicken - but with extra salt just to annoy him. Chuckles from the group. \nSMITH And you, Janusz? \nVOSS (TO SMITH) As long as the Communists are in Poland, he can't go back. \nZORAN They'd shoot you wouldn't they, Janusz? They settle down to sleep, outside the wind is picking up. \nJANUSZ I'll just keep on going. Until it's over. Keep on walking. SMITH looks through the gloom to where JANUSZ sits - moonlight slashes the side of his face, but he can't quite see his eyes. CLOSE on JANUSZ. He's wide awake. No thought of sleep. \n215 - OMIT \n216 INT. STABLES - DAWN 216 \nZORAN and VOSS agitated at the discovery that JANUSZ has gone. Much coming and going in and out of the hut, checking that he isn't somewhere close by. Only SMITH remains undisturbed as he sits with his back against the wall, the ghost of a smile on his lips. He expected nothing less. \n217 EXT. HIMALAYAS - DAY 217 \nUp ahead a figure, JANUSZ, dwarfed by the mountain chain, struggles on, climbing toward the snow-capped passes. \n218 EXT. HIGHER PASS DAY 218 \nAs he climbs he hears a cry, mingling with that of the wind - a voice echoing about the mountains. He ignores it for a few paces, before he looks back - far below two figures waving and calling - VOSS and ZORAN. \n219 EXT. MOUNTAIN SLOPE/VALLEY, TIBET/INDIA - DAWN 219 \nThe change from the barren mountains of Tibet, to the lush green of Sikkim is abrupt and startling - from rocky upper reaches the slope to the valley becomes rich in scrubby birch-woods, rhododendrons, and deciduous forest, until finally it becomes dense rain forest. It is with a backdrop of this luxuriant green that Indian faces look up toward the slopes. Here they watch three wild looking bearded men descending toward them. The additional cost of this final leg of their journey is plainly visible on their faces, and in their slow stumbling movements. They walk like automatons, only their senses fully alive. Shouts from the locals produce a village ELDER, then a POLICEMAN. Older children squeal with delight, while some of the very young cry out in fear, one even bursting into tears - are these the dreaded Yeti their grandfathers told them lived up in the mountain peaks? \n220 EXT. VALLEY PATH, INDIA - DAY 220 \nClose on JANUSZ, VOSS, and ZORAN as the beaming POLICEMAN escorts them past dozens of smiling faces. \n(CONTINUED) \n220 CONTINUED: 220 This being India, a small crowd of the curious rapidly swells, until the path is lined two and three deep on either side, like a welcoming crowd at the end of a marathon. Small children are held up for a better look, while hands reach out patting their backs and shoulders - it's as if they know these men have achieved something remarkable. Close on JANUSZ, as amongst the sound of the gathering crowd other voices join in, cheering voices, hundreds of them, rising in volume until the cheering changes into that of a chant, now seemingly swelled by thousands of voices. Still CLOSE on JANUSZ walking as behind him the Indian scene dissolves into a series of black and white images.

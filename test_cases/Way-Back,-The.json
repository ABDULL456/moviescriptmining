{"test1_input": "KAZIK Yes, but on their horses probably. \nPROF No. Same. On people. \nKAZIK How do you know that? \nPROF I was professor of Egyptology. Leningrad University. KAZIK manages a look at his companion, before putting even more effort into dragging the load. \n32 INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MINE - DAY 32 \nA man, enveloped in clouds of white steam, points a long pipe at the frozen rock and gravel - the heat making it easier for the pick and shovel men to dig. This is the 'POINT-MAN', and he opens and shuts valves on the pipe- stem which regulates the hot steam that travels along pipes leading back to a primitive boiler. Men try to warm themselves by working near the POINT-MAN, and when the guards are not around they clutch the pipes in their hands gaining a few moments of precious warmth. SMITH knows how to work the system and has found a spot here working beside the POINT-MAN. He looks across to see JANUSZ staggering up the slope toward the distant mine entrance, where a guard can be seen silhouetted against the light. He watches a moment, something not right about JANUSZ. He lays his shovel aside and hurries after him. \n33 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 33 \nJANUSZ scrambling toward the surface. He stumbles, falls to his knees. He looks down, sees something on the ground. \nJANUSZ'S VISION - DAY Something buried in the dirt and rubble - paving stones. He clears away the debris to reveal a stone path. Looking up he sees the path leads to a gate framed by a hedge. His P.O.V. as he moves up the path to the gate. His unseen hand opens the gate. Now the view is of the path as he walks forward - a series of worn flagstones, then the camera tilts up to see a closed front door. A pan to the left of the door - to see a loose brick in the wall. \n34 INT./EXT. TUNNEL - DAY 34 \nCLOSE on JANUSZ, as SMITH is suddenly beside him, grabbing his arm and swinging him into the darkness of an adjoining tunnel. \nSMITH Are you crazy? They'll shoot you. \nJANUSZ Got to get out! SMITH stares at him. He's delirious and begins to shake with cold. SMITH grabs his shoulder and drags him back to where the POINT'-MAN works, thrusting JANUSZ's hands around the pipe. The POINT-MAN waves them away but SMITH bribes him with a slice of bread. SMITH turns back to JANUSZ - the warmth of the pipe beginning to have its effect. \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) It can be done. \nSMITH What can be done? \nJANUSZ He knows a way through the wire. SMITH slaps a hand over his mouth, glancing at the Point- Man, before dragging JANUSZ further away. \n(CONTINUED) \n34 CONTINUED: 34 \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) \n(A WHISPER) He has a plan. \nSMITH Who? \nJANUSZ His name is Khabarov. Now SMITH understands. \nSMITH The actor. \nJANUSZ You know him? \nSMITH He has no intention of escaping. \nJANUSZ What? \nSMITH He's aliar. Been here foryears -seeksout new arrivals, mewhen Ifirstcame here. He justlikes totalkabout escape. I'veknown others like him. \nJANUSZ Why should I believe you? \nSMITH (shakes his head) Nothing is for nothing in the camps. From you he gets your energy, your spirit. You feed his 'dream' of escape. You help keep him alive. He's no more than a leech. \nJANUSZ You're a cold bastard, Mister. \nSMITH \n(SHRUGS) I'm still alive, that's all I know. But I won't be in six months. And neither will you. Not in the mines. So, if you're serious about making a run for it - I'm in. \n(CONTINUED) \n34 CONTINUED: (2) 34 \nJANUSZ I thought you were a loner? \n", "test1_true": "JANUSZ And what's that? \nSMITH Compassion. If anything happens to me, I'm counting on you carrying me. JANUSZ knows he's not joking. \n35 EXT. CAMP KITCHEN, SAME TIME - NIGHT 35 \nIt is snowing heavily, and after swallowing their soup, JANUSZ and his friends walk back to the barracks. KAZIK stumbles, and is helped to his feet by VOSS. He limps on to the barrack a hand resting for support on VOSS' shoulder. JANUSZ is preoccupied and he hesitates at t he door, turns, and looks back. After a moment staring at the ground he hurries inside. \n36 INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 36 \nJANUSZ has a puzzled KHABAROV by the arm, guiding him back to the door. \n37 EXT. BARRACKS - NIGHT 37 \nHe points to the ground - CLOSE on footprints as they rapidly disappear under the heavy snowfall. \nJANUSZ Tonight. KHABAROV looks from the footprints to JANUSZ, a horrified look on his face. \nKHABAROV It's a passing storm! \nJANUSZ It'll do, it'll cover our tracks. \n(CONTINUED) \n37 CONTINUED: \nKHABAROV Impossible! We need preparation, detailed plans, maps \nJANUSZ \n(OVERLAP) The timing will never be perfect, they won't expect it now! \nKHABAROV But the distances! And food! What about food? \nJANUSZ We've been trading, the American is with us. He has food, you have food. \nKHABAROV How long will that last? \nJANUSZ I've spent half my life in the woods and mountains. We'll live off the land. \nKHABAROV It can't be done! JANUSZ shocked at the change in his friends' demeanor, the appalling realization that SMITH was right about him. He seizes his arm. \nJANUSZ How do we get through the wire? \nKHABAROV I don't know what you're talking about. \nJANUSZ Your friend, Lazar, he knows doesn't he? A look of fear crosses KHABAROV's face. Someone behind JANUSZ. JANUSZ turns. VALKA, a few paces away watching them. KHABAROV scuttles back inside the barracks. JANUSZ hesitates a moment, then follows. \nA38 INT. BARRACKS - NIGHT A38 \nIn the last minutes before lights out the would-be escapees make discreet preparations. Clothing and other items are traded for food and tobacco. The COOK and BOHDAN are at the center of the camp black-market and most of the trading is done with them. TOMASZ trades more pornographic sketches with BOHDAN while KAZIK tries to trade his scarf for a pair of boots - his own being in poor shape. VOSS sits beside him, and notices that KAZIK does not look directly at his shoes or the scarf, but is doing everything by feel. As they move away VOSS whispers to him. \nVOSS You can't see, can you? A look of panic crosses the boy's face. \nKAZIK \n(WHISPERS) Don't leave me behind! VOSS conflicted. \nKAZIK (CONT'D) Promise me, Andrejs! I could keep a hand on your shoulder by night, and in the day I can see just fine. I won't hold you up. Please don't tell them. I'll die here. JANUSZ and SMITH sit in a darkened corner working on LAZAR. They want to know how to get through the wire. He is reluctant until SMITH produces a wristwatch from his boot. The strapless watch, of good make, settles the deal, just as the light flickers and goes out plunging the barracks into darkness. \nAB38 EXT. THE CAMP - NIGHT AB38 \nSeveral shots of the wind driven snow whipping about the buildings. \n38 INT. BARRACKS - LATER THAT NIGHT 38 \nThe wooden building creaks and heaves like a ship at sea as the storm builds into a fully fledged blizzard. The sounds of the sleeping men, the usual cries and groans, hacking coughs, all mix into the howl of the storm. CLOSE on the conspirators lying awake - SMITH, VOSS, KAZIK, TOMASZ and ZORAN. SMITH looks across to JANUSZ, catches his eye. A signal from JANUSZ, 'not yet'. KHABAROV too, is awake. He jumps at any unexpected sound, checks his horde of food in the hiding place at the base of his bunk, as if expecting at any moment to be attacked and robbed. He sees a shadow. Someone moving about near him, a look of terror on his face. \nLATER, JANUSZ lies on his back listening to the storm. A movement beside him, then a knife pressed against his throat. It's VALKA. He grins, steel-capped teeth, his cross dangling from his neck. JANUSZ goes still. \n", "test1_id": 2850, "test2_input": "74 EXT./INT. CAVE - NIGHT 74 \nSleeping figures by the fire. TOMASZ tosses and turns, muttering in his sleep. JANUSZ is awake as is VALKA who sits close beside him. A whispered conversation - \nVALKA Who will be first? JANUSZ looks at him. \nJANUSZ You mean the first to die? VALKA nods, indicates TOMASZ. \nVALKA I think that sucker, the artist. But better if it was him. He nods toward ZORAN. \nJANUSZ It might be you. VALKA shrugs. \nJANUSZ (CONT'D) Why 'better' if it's Zoran? VALKA squeezes the flesh of his upper arms. \nVALKA More soft. More tender. JANUSZ shakes his head, 'no'. \nVALKA (CONT'D) Mister only gets little fish now. We must have meat, or we die. You're the Pakhan, you've thought of it. We all have. That's why you brought extra people isn't it? For food? An old Urka escape trick. I swear to God you were an Urka in another life. \nJANUSZ We'll get food when we get to Lake Baikal, plenty of fish there. \n(CONTINUED) \n74 CONTINUED: \nVALKA You said we should have seen Lake a week ago. We're lost, Pakhan. JANUSZ stares into the fire as VALKA lays down to sleep. \nA75 LATER, NIGHT \nA75 It is ZORAN's turn on watch and he stands near the entrance to the cave, his blanket about his shoulders, looking out into the still night. Behind him a low growling sound, coming from deep in the cave. He turns, a look of terror on his face. He can see nothing but a dim light deep in the cave where moonlight penetrates through two large holes in the cave roof. He wakes JANUSZ, alerting him to the sound. JANUSZ in turn wakes VALKA, and after taking burning sticks from the fire they walk back inside the vast cave toward the source of the sound, VALKA drawing his knife. \n75 INT. CAVE - NIGHT \nThe dim light shows a wolf-pack growling as they pick at a carcass on the cave floor. They drop their bones and face the intruders, baring their fangs, all now growling. On a signal from JANUSZ they rush the wolves, who run back toward another exit from the cave. MR. SMITH, TOMASZ and VOSS come hurrying to join them, woken by all the barking and shouting. VALKA falls on part of the carcass, cutting off chunks of raw meat. The others do likewise. Wider on the group, down on all fours chewing on the remains of the kill, only JANUSZ stands back, watching them. \nEXT./INT. CAVE - EARLY MORNING 76 \nSome sleep on, others stir, their movements slow and listless. They are near the end. This has been JANUSZ's point of view as he packs a few scraps of food into his pockets and picks up his staff. Those awake stare at him. \nJANUSZ I'll be back in a week - if I find the lake. If not, you're on your own. \nVALKA I come too. \n(CONTINUED) \n76 CONTINUED: 76 \nJANUSZ (shakes his head) I'll travel faster alone. Mr. Smith will be the Pakhan while I'm gone. JANUSZ turns and with a nod of the head 'follow me', to SMITH, he moves off. \n77 EXT. SOME DISTANCE FROM CAMP - DAWN 77 \nNow out of earshot, JANUSZ turns to SMITH. SMITH knows what it's about. \nSMITH I know. Valka. \nJANUSZ Don't let him out of your sight. \nSMITH Good luck. As JANUSZ heads off into the forest. \n78 EXT. OPEN COUNTRY, SIBERIA - DAY 78 \nA magnificent vista - a broad plain sweeping toward a distant line of hills. It's a beautiful clear day and the lone figure of JANUSZ, dwarfed by the landscape, walks steadily Southward. \n79 EXT. ROCKY HILLSIDE - DUSK 79 \nSheltering from the wind on the leeside of a hill, he takes pine-cones from his pocket, breaks them open and eats the seeds. Then he's up and off again, leaning heavily on his staff. \n80 EXT. A BARREN PLAIN - DAY 80 \nThe weather changes from a clear Spring morning to cold and overcast as gusts of wind whip down from distant slopes. JANUSZ bends into the wind, his pace slowing. He stumbles, sinks to the ground, fighting the desire to let go, to give himself to sleep, and the swift death that will surely follow. His eyes begin to close. Then he sees it. Just ahead of him. The gate. The gate from his vision in the mine. He struggles to his feet, staggers on - \n", "test2_true": "80 CONTINUED: 80 JANUSZ'S VISION: A repeat of his earlier hallucination - the click of the gate latch, the flagstones at his feet as he moves down the path. (All the while the accompanying sound is of JANUSZ's laboured breathing in the present 'reality'). He's at the front door, camera pans to the loose brick in the wall beside the door. \n81 EXT. CAMPSITE, FOREST - DUSK 81 \nJANUSZ staggers back into camp, half dead and shivering with cold. VALKA is quickly beside him with SMITH and \nVOSS. \nJANUSZ Three days from here. South by West. He collapses. VOSS shouts for the fire to be built up, hot water to be boiled. He feels his pulse, checks his eyes. \nVOSS Stones! Gather stones! Heat them in the fire! \n82 EXT. CAMPSITE, STILL LATER - NIGHT 82 \nThroughout the night they take turns replacing the hot stones surrounding his body and massaging his feet and hands. On one such occasion SMITH finds himself at JANUSZ's side. JANUSZ opens his eyes. \nSMITH What's the 'brick'? \nJANUSZ What did I say? \nSMITH Something about a loose brick. JANUSZ nods, offers no explanation. \nSMITH (CONT'D) You know if you don't pull through soon we'll have to leave you. \nJANUSZ I expect nothing less. \n(CONTINUED) \n82 CONTINUED: 82 \nSMITH So you better get better quick if you want to see home again. \nJANUSZ We could've used you in the Polish army. Fired you out of a cannon. He closes his eyes, lapses back into a deep sleep. \n83 OMITTED 83 \n84 EXT. HILLSIDE, SIBERIA - DUSK 84 \nIt's a beautiful evening as the file of travellers climb toward the crest of the hill. \n85 EXT. MOUNTAIN, SIBERIA - DUSK 85 \nFrom the crest, a panorama of Lake Baikal - a massive body of water stretching to the horizon. The fugitives rest, and consider the next stage of their \njourney. \nSMITH \n(TO JANUSZ) \nWe're going to have to follow the \nWestern shore. \nZORAN \nBut look, it bends like that - \nwon't it take us longer? \nJANUSZ \nSee all those settlements on the \nother side? We'd never get \nthrough. \nVALKA I swear to God, those mother- fuckers would cut off our heads, take them to secret police. Get more for us than they would for their fish. JANUSZ, impatient to move on, is already on his feet. ZORAN rolls onto his back with a groan. \n", "test2_id": 2851, "test3_input": "(A WHISPER) No mosquitos. The others unsure of his meaning. \nZORAN (CONT'D) They have no mosquitos! \n115 EXT. VARIOUS LOCATIONS, LAKESIDE - DAY/DUSK 115 \nThe group have by now a walking routine which they rarely vary, always occupying the same positions in extended line. JANUSZ as navigator in the lead, SMITH generally bringing up the rear. IRENA is the exception - varying her place, now with one, now with another. They don't talk much to each other as they walk but they do talk with her. She has the knack of getting anyone to talk. No doubt a skill learnt in her life on the streets. \n116 EXT. FOREST NEAR THE ROAD - DAY 116 \nA small fire burns as TOMASZ cooks a fish stolen by VALKA. The smoke from the fire is not enough to alleviate the mosquito problem and the group swat in miserable silence. Suddenly SMITH throws dirt on the fire, suffocating it with his jacket. He points to the road. \n117 EXT. ROAD - DAY 117 \nFrom their point of view a fisherman in his fifties, a basket in a sling on his back, walks abreast of them on the track. \n118 EXT. FOREST - DAY 118 \nAs he passes, ZORAN speaks in a whisper to JANUSZ. \nZORAN There it is! Again! JANUSZ mystified. \nZORAN (CONT'D) Look at him. JANUSZ stares again at the man. \nZORAN (CONT'D) No mosquitos! ZORAN is up and off before anyone can stop him. They watch in appalled silence as he approaches and speaks to the man, who regards this stranger appearing from the forest with some suspicion. ZORAN does a kind of crazy dance, talking all the while. \n(CNNTTNTTED ) \nRevised 4/23/09 (Buff) 70. \n118 CONTINUED: 118 Soon the man is laughing, and putting down his bag and gun he takes something from around his neck and places it on ZORAN's neck. A few more words, and more laughter, then with a handshake ZORAN heads back into the forest, the man continuing on his way. ZORAN rejoins them, holding up the gift from the old man - strands of intertwined bark. \nZORAN (CONT'D) Mosquito repellent! And I have the formula! \n119 EXT. ROAD - DAY 119 \nLATER. They all wear necklaces of the entwined bark and are mosquito free. ZORAN is the hero of the hour. \nTOMASZ But what did you say to him? \nZORAN That I was an escaped convict who was being plagued by mosquitos. As they round a bend and disappear from sight, TOMASZ's voice drifts back. \nTOMASZ (V.O.) Very funny. But what did you really say? \nA120 LAKE'S END, SIBERIA - DAY A120 JANUSZ scoops up a handful of water where it laps a beach. It's a symbolic end to their lake trek, and they turn and walk on, the lake behind them. \n120 EXT. A FIELD, SIBERIA - DAY 120 \nIn the far distance a large town dominated by a collection of smoke stacks, belching out columns of smoke into the sky, as the group hurry across open ground to the shelter of the forest. \nA121 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY A121 \nA rustic cart passes by. After it has gone the fugitives emerge from concealment and resume their journey. \nRevised 4/23/09 (Buff) 70aA. \nAB121 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY AB121 \nVOSS, ZORAN and TOMASZ talk of their pre-Gulag days with \nIRENA. \nVOSS A small stone church in a little village. Very peaceful. I grew up in that village. Then, \nZORAN I went on business. Once a year - government clients of course! Then, \nTOMASZ .layers of very fine pastry, so when you bite there is a lightness, a delicacy - it should almost melt in the mouth. \n121 EXT.

And Tomasz is a pastry chef but wants to be an artist? \nSMITH Is that right? \nIRENA And Zoran was on business in Moscow, arrested in Red Square, he said he was just taking a photo of the Kremlin! He's an accountant. \nSMITH Well, I'll be damned. Never knew a funny accountant. \nIRENA Don't you talk to each other? \nSMITH In the camps you learn to say as little as possible. They walk on in silence, IRENA sneaking a look up at him. \n122 OMITTED 122 \n123 EXT. COUNTRYSIDE, LATER - DAY 123 \nIRENA now walking with JANUSZ. \nJANUSZ Mr. Smith? An American? Working on the Moscow metro? \nIRENA \n(NODS) He's an engineer. His father was Finnish. Grew up in America, but he could speak Russian. \nJANUSZ Why did he come to Russia for God's sake? \nIRENA The Depression.

A STREAM - DUSK 124 \nThe group fords a shallow stream when IRENA sees SMITH limp to a rock where he sits and inspects his blistered, bleeding feet IRENA kneels before him, dries his feet with her dress. The others watch silently as she tears strips from her petticoat and binds up the raw spots between his toes. \n125 EXT. A RIDGE ABOVE THE TRANS-SIBERIAN RAILWAY - DAY 125 \nThe GROUP look down to see the railway track lined with villagers every few miles, making a crossing especially hazardous. \nJANUSZ The Mongolian border is on the other side of those tracks. Two ARMED SOLDIERS can be seen walking along the tracks. \nTOMASZ Can't we go around this? \nJANUSZ This is the main line. It's going to be like this everywhere. \nSMITH We don't have a choice. \nJANUSZ We cross at night. Their attention is caught by the passing of a long freight train, horn sounding over the bucolic scene. \n126 EXT. A RIDGE ABOVE THE RAILWAY-LINE - DAY 126 \nA visible tension in the group as they wait. VALKA whittles a piece of deer-bone. \nTOMASZ What's that you're making? \n(CNNTTNTTRD ) \n", "test3_id": 2852}

GABE (misses the point) Yeah, they made it pretty good then. Each of these strands ought to hold about 300 pounds before snapping. 
Gabe rapidly ties the rope to the piton -- Maggie works on the third connecting knot as she does the mental calculation of what she and Gabe weigh together. 
MAGGIE (dazed) Ought to. About. (beat) Will it hold? 
Gabe takes the line from her and lets it drop. Ninety feet of what looks like twine. 
GABE Depends on how big a breakfast you had. You want to go first? 
Maggie's stunned -- but there's no choice. She starts the rappel down, and Gabe is close behind. 
INSERT - THE THIRD BOMB 
is ready to blow -- 0:12 -- 0:11 -- 
MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING DOWN 
To make this even trickier, they have to swing over to the side about fifteen feet to get to the cave -- meaning they have to move down in pendulum type swings that put even more pressure on 
THE ROPE 
which looks sorely tested at one knot -- it's coming undone -- 
MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING 
They swing down lower -- twenty feet to the cave, four thousand to the ground -- 
INSERT - THE BOMB 
MAGGIE AND GABE - RAPPELLING 
They reach the end of the rope -- six feet above the cave and fifteen feet away laterally. 
GABE (shouting) Swing towards it -- and drop! 
Maggie nods -- they start the swing over -- as they get over the cave's lip -- 
THE ROPE 
snaps -- 
MAGGIE AND GABE 
fall, landing roughly on the cave's narrow lip -- Gabe starts to slip over, but Maggie pulls him back as -- 
ABOVE ON THE WALL 
The bomb detonates and starts raining debris -- an instant, massive rockslide -- 
MAGGIE AND GABE 
dive into the small cave as the rockslide tumbles past -- exhausted, they collapse on the cave floor. 
THE HELICOPTER - OVER THE TOWER 
Frank, obviously, is surprised by the nearby explosion. 
FRANK What the fuck -- 
But he sees Kristel in a clearing. Face down in the snow. First things first. 
EXT. TOWER/CLEARING 
Frank lands near her, and rushes over to her. Frank turns her over and breaks a capsule under her nose. She "wakes up" with a start and looks "terrified". 
KRISTEL What -- who are -- 
FRANK Don't worry. I'm here to help. 
KRISTEL (recovered) Glad to hear it. 
Kristel sees the snap is off Frank's holster -- she grabs it, spins it around, and pulls the trigger. CLICK. Frank grabs her wrist with a move faster than you'd expect from him, and he yanks the pistol back. 
FRANK Jailhouse load. First chamber's empty -- (aims gun) -- the rest aren't. Forgive me, but things have been a little strange this morning. 
Nearby, the helicopter radio crackles to life. Frank backs toward the helicopter, keeping the gun trained on Kristel. 
But Frank only gets to the helicopter door before -- 
DELMER 
comes out of hiding and empties a clip from his automatic into Frank. Frank is pinned to the door by the fusillade before he can even get a shot off. Travers runs over to Delmer and shoves the barrel up. 
TRAVER Stop! (explaining) You'll damage the helicopter. 
As if to punctuate this, Frank -- and the now ruined pilot side door -- fall to the ground. The radio continues to squawk as Travers grabs Frank's discarded gun. 
TRAVERS (to Kristel) Answer that. 
Kristel brushes the snow off her and goes over to the radio. 
STUART (O.S.) (over radio) Calling Rocky Mountain Rescue -- come in, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- over -- 
KRISTEL (keying radio) Rocky Mountain Rescue One, over -- 
EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY 
Wright, davis, and an irritated Stuart huddle over a radio. 
STUART This is Ross Stuart, Federal Aviation Administration -- please identify -- over -- 
EXT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
By now, the others have come out of hiding and up to the helicopter. Kristel grabs some papers from a plastic packet on the helicopter seat -- and keys the mike. 
KRISTEL Copy, FAA. This is Margaret Deighan, Rocky Mountain Rescue. Over --

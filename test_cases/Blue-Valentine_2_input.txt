DEAN Here? 
Cindy gives him a grimace. 
CINDY Same streets. Same people. Everything here is the same. You walk down the street, you can't get lost... you know. (CONTINUED) Blue Valentine Official Green Script as of 6/9/09 46. 91 CONTINUED: 91 
DEAN Where do you want to go? I mean, if you could go anywhere.. 
They walk to an old playground. Cindy gets an idea. 
CINDY There! 
Cindy runs to an old, creaky merry-go round, jumps on. 
CINDY (CONT'D) I used to love these things. 
DEAN Oh God... I hate these things. 
CINDY Push me. 
Dean is tentative, but goes along with her. He starts slow, but she eggs him to go faster. He runs in circles picking up speed until he is in a breathless, circular sprint. He can't keep up with the centrifugal force. 
CINDY (CONT'D) Get on! 
Dean does as he's told. They both hold on for dear life. The world spins in a frenzy. The dread on Dean's face builds to insane laughter. It is super fun. Cindy screams. Her hair snaps in her face. Then, a look of sickness steals her smile away. She wants it to stop, which, slowly, it does. She gets off first, tries to walk, but is too dizzy. She just keeps falling to the ground. Dean crawls off the merry-go round on all fours, laughing.

DEAN What happened, tough guy? 
CINDY Make it stop. 
DEAN You gotta puke... it's the only way. 
She refuses. 
DEAN (CONT'D) It's the only way. It will make you feel better. Don't be embarrassed. I'll do it. 
He sticks his finger down his throat and forces himself to vomit. The sound of it is too much for her. She gags. Side by side, they puke into the gravel. They finish their business and end up on their backs and out of breath, side by side, looking up at the stars. They are both covered in sweat. We see their breath. 
CINDY I'm still spinning. 
DEAN Me too. 
CINDY Maybe it's just the Earth that's spinning. 
DEAN Yeah. We're flying. 
They laugh. Birds begin to awaken and fly. 
DEAN (CONT'D) You should come visit me in the city sometime. 
The morning air chills their bodies. Dean takes off his jacket and uses it as a blanket. They get close together to get warm and watch the stars spin above them. 
INT. ROMANTASUITES - MOON ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT DAY 
The dining room table is set for two. A single champagne glass is raised. 
DEAN To honesty...

They sit across from each other. Cindy drinks premature. 
DEAN (CONT'D) Hey! Wait up. 
CINDY We're toasting tonight? 
Dean makes his toast. CLINK. Dean quaffs his glass. 
CINDY (CONT'D) Sometimes you don't make any sense. You might as well be speaking Chinese. 
Dean imitates a Chinese man - it goes on too long.

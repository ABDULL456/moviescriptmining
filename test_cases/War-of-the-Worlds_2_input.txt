The machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to other robots. It arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire. People can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the beam. The beams, when fired make a zap sound. People start exploding into dust and their clothes are blown away. Ray misses numerous beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. Again Ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches. He runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. Disintegrator beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. Ray hides behind a building as the machine walks by. 
EXT. RAY'S HOUSE - PORCH -  EVENING 
Ray walks into the house where he is met by Rachel's gawking eyes out the window. Robbie stands in the background looking at the doorway. Ray walks past Rachel then Robbie toward the kitchen. Rachel and Robbie follow him into the kitchen. With anxious eyes, Robbie begins to say... 
ROBBIE 
What happened? 
Ray sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the kitchen, not responding. 
RACHEL 
What's going on? 
Robbie squats down next to Ray as Rachel rests her elbows on the stool at the island. 
RACHEL 
Dad, what's the matter? 
ROBBIE 
What's all that stuff all over you? 
Ray seems to be delirious as he slurs his head towards Robbie. 
Rachel reaches through a leg of the island to pull at Ray's hood on his shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his head toward Rachel fast enough to make some of the white powder poof off as if jerked back into reality. Robbie jumps as well in fright. 
RACHEL 
What's all the stuff? 
ROBBIE 
Hello? Ray? 
Ray looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder. He gets up and begins heading for the bathroom. Still unresponsive to the questions he was just asked. He looks in the mirror to see that he is covered in the whit powder (human ash). He quickly does his best to wash it off realizing what it is. After washing it off, he begins mentally planning what to do. 
Walking back into the kitchen... 
RAY 
We're leaving this house in 60 seconds. 
Ray grabs an old Penzoil box and dumps the tools out of it. He shoves the box into Robbie who grasps it as to not fall over at the force Ray used. 
ROBBIE 
(questioning) What? Wait. I have no idea what's going on... 
RAY 
(while Robbie asks) ... all the food from the refrigerator and the cupboard, put it in here. 
ROBBIE 
I think we are having a bit of a shock here...what's going on, just tell me... 
RAY 
Just do it. 
Ray runs toward the table, grabs a flashlight and begins to try to get it to work. 
RAY 
Rachel, sweetheart... 
RACHEL 
Dad, you're really scaring me. 
RAY 
I need you to get your suitcase... 
RACHEL 
Dad. (break) Dad! 
RAY 
The one that you brought, bring it to me, okay? 
Ray shoves cereal boxes aside to get to the cabinet over the refrigerator for batteries. Hastily grabbing the package, he realizes they are probably dead due to the EMP. 
RAY 
Can you do that for me, darling?

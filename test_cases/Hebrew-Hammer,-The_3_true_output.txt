INT. HAMMER'S CADDY - CONTINUOUS 
Things definitely seem odd. The Hammer looks out his left window. TWO Hasidic CHILDREN decorate a giant Christmas tree on the street. 
He looks to his right. A GROUP of HASIDIC kids sing Christmas Carols. 
The Hammer looks through his front windshield. A kid is standing right in the middle of the road! 
The Hammer slams on his breaks, skidding to a stop just inches from the kid. It's Shlomo (remember the kid the Hammer helped with the Yarmulke earlier?), and he has a strange glazed look in his eyes. Shlomo holds a videocassette in his hand. 
The Hammer steps out of the Caddy, leaving his car door open. We hear the annoying beep, beep, beep door ajar sound. 
HAMMER Shlomo, you okay? 
SHLOMO (Dreamily) Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings! 
HAMMER Huh. 
The car door beeps again. The kid looks to it, and the Hammer follows his gaze. 
SHLOMO Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings! 
The Hammer is baffled. He looks down at Shlomo's hand and spots the videocassette. He grabs it from him and examines at it. 
HAMMER Bootleg 'It's A Wonderful Life' from Taiwan. 
The Hammer inspects the tape a little longer, and then gives the label a huge lick. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) Sixty five percent pure. Damn! People could get hurt watching this shit. (To Shlomo) Come with me. 
A POV shot from inside the Hammer's trunk as it opens. Hammer stands with Shlomo. 
Inside the trunk we see a box of videos. The three on top read, "Fiddler On The Roof," "Yentl," and "Chaim Potok's The Chosen." The Hammer grabs a copy of the Chosen and hands it to Shlomo. 
SHLOMO Chaim Potok's The Chosen? 
HAMMER Get yourself home and watch this as soon as possible. 
A HASIDIC KID ON A BIKE with a Christmas tree in tow rides past the two. One of the ornaments makes a tinkling sound. 
SHLOMO Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings! 
The Hammer slaps him out of his spell. 
HAMMER Hey, hey, hey! You can beat this. Now get going. 
EXT. JEWISH GHETTO STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
The Hammer dials a number on the payphone. As he dials, he verbalizes the number he's calling. 
HAMMER 
The Hammer struggles with the last number, but then quickly remembers. 
HAMMER (CONT'D) 
It rings once, and then we hear the other line pick up. 
INT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS 
The Chief's on the other end. 
INTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION 
HAMMER Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead. 
CHIEF You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen? 
HAMMER That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands.

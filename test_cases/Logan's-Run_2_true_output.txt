LOGAN (whispering) How will they know we're coming? 
JESSICA (whispering) They're watching us now. They'll let us in when they're sure. 
200X2	CLOSE-UP - LOGAN'S HAND (INSERT) As he fumbles the transceiver switches at his belt, punching out a signal. 
200X3	INT. - SANDMAN H.Q. READY ROOM 
As the Sandmen monitoring SEE THE SIGNAL FLASH and move smoothly into action. 
200X4	LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Close together, he behind, waiting--alert as a VOICE is suddenly heard: 
VOICE (scratchy, filtered) Sandman, put your hands on your head. (he does) Clasp your fingers together. Now turn your hands over. Palms up. (beat) In a moment a light will shine in your eyes. Walk into it--Jessica first, then you, Sandman. You will have to stoop--but don't unclasp your hands. Do you agree? 
Logan nods. 
Jessica glances back at him but their faces are unreadable in the dark. Then suddenly--in front of her--a blindingly bright, narrow rectangle of light illuminating them fiercely. Jessica moves forward. Even she has to stoop. Logan is close behind. As he bends awkwardly into the opening, the light goes out. 
201		LOGAN, JESSICA -- SANCTUARY HQ 
As he pushes her through the opening then moves instantly to the side, pulling her with him.. The move fails. Both are pinned helplessly in the blinding glare of the spotlight and the sudden appearance of glass-silver spear points pressed against them. Logan is unable to draw his gun. 
VOICE Hold still, Sandman, or die where you are. 
2ND VOICE Is she the one? OTHER VOICES (like angry stage whispers) She betrayed us. Kill him. Kill them both. Jessica you sold us. Sandman butcher. Sandman murderer. 
Logan and Jessica stand rigid against the spear points, only their heads turning to the echoing sibilants.. The spotlight goes off. 
202-204 	OUT 
205		INT. - SANCTUARY HQ. - LOGAN, JESSICA - CLOSE 
In the darkness we see the glass-silver spear points are glowing all around them, the long shafts falling away into darkness, the points, steaming gently when they touch--making an instant, wincing burn. Logan moves--a spear point presses--he flinches. 
LOGAN I'm a runner. She brought me here because I begged her to help me. 
He turns his palm. The red crystal blinks impressively in the darkness. 
At the sight, a BABBLE of SOUNDS. Argument. 
VOICE He's lying. No Sandman ever ran. 
2ND VOICE You don't run. You kill runners. You have killed runners all your life.	- 
LOGAN Yes I have. (beat) Now it's my turn. And I want to live. 
Another angry murmur of VOICES. Over it Jessica suddenly: 
JESSICA (shouting) What's the matter with you. He's a runner-- he's blinking. We must help anyone who asks...we must-or we're the same as they are--deciding who lives and dies. 
One of the points lifts and touches Jessica's cheek. A quick, fierce burn. She shrieks--a tiny sound--and is silent. 
206		LOGAN 
Reacts fiercely, spinning against the spear points, he is Jabbed and pierced in a dozen places as he manages to get Jessica closer, shielding her with his body. But the spear points are too much. He subsides, as VOICES rise angrily "Kill him now". 
Suddenly a RINGING ALARM. All sound stops at once and we hear a CLATTER of FOOTSTEPS down the iron stair and across the outer floor. The spotlight bursts on again and a figure staggers into the chamber, straightening into the light, hair dishevelled, hands in front against the glare. It's Holly. 
HOLLY Holly. Holly, New You 483... He's dead. Doc's dead and the Sandmen came... 
VOICE (gentle) Holly--Holly. Remember the code. The code, please Holly... 
HOLLY (hysteria) They smashed everything and I barely got away. (beat) Holly. Station 12, Sanctuary 7. Holly. Holly... 
She lowers her hands and we see her, tattered, frightened--the bright smile strange. She comes to herself a bit, looks to the side and sees Logan and Jessica, pinned against the wall. 
She reacts with fear at the sight. HOLLY It's him! The first Sandman. He killed...Doc. 
JESSICA No, Holly--wait! He's running. Tell them the rest! HOLLY (suddenly exhausted) He's the one. You too. I remember. He was in a hurry. Just a face job. Dark hair, I said. Then he killed Doc and you grabbed me--and the machine blew up and I ran...I ran JESSICA Holly. Holly! Please...The other Sandman. Remember the one who came after-- 
Holly suddenly remembers and the shock makes her lucid. 
HOLLY (pouring it out) That's right. The other one came after. The older one. Smashing, killing, burning! 
JESSICA (coaching desperately) ...and he was hunting the first one, this one. Wasn't he? Wasn't he? This one was running, the other one was hunting him... 
HOLLY (remembers) Yes. Oh yes. (to Logan) He was after you. I remember. You're running!

PASSENGER JET - EARLY MORNING \nSleepy thick fatigue, the end of a red-eye flight. Most passengers still asleep, a few read, or stare blankly. In business class, A HUSBAND and WIFE, mid-30's. He's awake, reading a document. She sleeps nestled against his shoulder. He's trim, sharp, good looking in an academic way. Even in sleep, she's beautiful. Wide-mouthed and honey-haired. The plane's aspect SHIFTS, the pilot's voice comes on in German. The man lifts his window shade, peers out at the first rays of sun touching the skyline of Berlin. \nEXT. TEGEL AIRPORT, BERLIN - EARLY MORNING \nHalo of lights. Giant talons, the airplane's LANDING GEAR appears through cloud. Tires hit slick asphalt. \nINT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - SAME \nThe couple. Dr. Martin Harris and Elizabeth Harris. WIDER: a German IMMIGRATION OFFICER glances up at MARTIN and LIZ. KA- CHUNK! KA-CHUNK! Stamps both passports, swipes the bar codes over a scanner, hands them back. Martin slips his into a leather briefcase. \nEXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL, TEGEL AIRPORT - DAWN \nRaining. A melee of travelers and vehicles. Liz beside him, Martin wheels a baggage cart through the crush. An ATTENDANT ushers them toward a waiting cab and DRIVER... a CRASH of THUNDER -- the rain suddenly triples in strength. A DELUGE. The taxi driver hustles Martin and Liz towards his car. He shields his head with a newspaper, piling their bags into the trunk, cursing. Martin sets down his case, moves to help the driver... \nI/E. TAXI CAB - DAWN The DRIVER merges onto the autobahn. Liz yawns with jet-lag, studies Martin who stares out at the passing city. \nLIZ Hey... You're gonna do great. You always do. \nI/E. TAXI/HOTEL IMPERIAL, BERLIN - MORNING Modern 'Deco Revival' hotel/conference center. A banner welcomes delegates to the World Biotechnology Forum. The Harris' taxi pulls up in the forecourt thick with red-eye travelers arriving for early morning check-in. Martin takes out his billfold. \nMARTIN I'll do this. You check in. Liz pecks his cheek, gets out. Martin leans forward. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) How much do we owe you? \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME \nLiz presses up to the crowded desk. A busy RECEPTIONIST takes Liz's booking slip. \nLIZ The Eisenhower suite. Dr. and Mrs. Harris. \nEXT. HOTEL FORECOURT - SAME \nA BELLHOP holds a large umbrella up to the rain, loads the Harris' bags onto his cart. Shuts the trunk, the taxi pulls away. Heading for the entrance... \nBELLHOP Welcome to the Hotel Imperial. Have you stayed with us before? \nMARTIN No, this is our first visit to Berlin. We're -- -- he stops short, staring at their bags, stacked on the luggage cart. He turns, tracks the their taxi, already pulling out of the drive... \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - SAME \na stab of concern on Liz's face. \nLIZ What do you mean the suite may not be available? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nRECEPTIONIST I have to check with the manager. Security inspections of the rooms are still being completed. \nLIZ But we confirmed two months ago. Receptionist raises an apologetic hand as she attends to a ringing phone. Liz sighs, glances back toward the entrance. Suddenly curious as she sees... \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. -- THE FILMY RED . of light seen from behind closed eyelids. Quiet... except for a distant sound. CRACKLING. Like falling rain. The sound growing. Close now. Filling our ears, as... \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \n.a tiny pin-hole of light, TOO BRIGHT. GLIMPSES of a NURSE as she tears the wrapping off a fresh drip sac... \nBLACK .A man's voice... distant. German words. Small, faded image of a German DOCTOR, speaking with the nurse... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBLACK .again, a pin-hole of consciousness. The Nurse, taking a private moment, speaking in German on her cell-phone. The Nurse looks over, straight at us, realization in her face, she hurries from the room. We REVOLVE... finding... MARTIN HARRIS. Arms by his sides. A few days beard. A sutured cut on his temple. His eyes fluttering, barely open... then closing. Clipboard beside the bed. An admission form. In German. Where Martin's name should be: \"unbekannte maennliche Person\", and the SUBTITLE becomes our MAIN TITLE... \n'UNKNOWN WHITE MALE'... \nCLOSE - MARTIN'S FACE Squeak of a door. Distant FOOTSTEPS. Quiet again. Just the distant PULSE of his heartbeat. His eyes... flick OPEN. \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. - HIS SURROUNDINGS... Vision BLURRED, BLINKING to focus. Scrubbed floor, white walls, Banks of drips and monitors, his possessions on a table near him... \nVOICE (O.S.) Konnen Sie mich horen? \nMARTIN'S EYES -- TRACKING OVER Daylight through a window. Sitting by the bed is a dark- haired man with a van Dyke beard. DR. FARGE. \nFARGE Wenn Sie mich horen konnen, blinken Sie zweimal. He watches as Martin's eyes tilt. Look directly at him. A sound. A dry croak... slowly forms itself into speech: \nMARTIN I... I don't... speak German... \nFARGE (beat - accented) Are you English? \nMARTIN . American... A beat. Farge signals the Nurse to come in. Speaks to him slowly and clearly in English: \n(CONTINUED) \nS. \nCONTINUED: (2) \nFARGE My name is Doctor Farge. You are in the Waldfriede Hospital. I'm the head neurologist here. You have been in an accident. \n(BEAT) Can you tell me your name? Beat. Martin nods. Voice weak. \nMARTIN Martin... Harris. Doctor... Martin Harris... Farge exchanges a look with the nurse. To Martin... \nFARCE Where are you staying? Is there anyone here, in Berlin, that we \nMIGHT -- Martin suddenly looks around, struggles to sit up. \nMARTIN My wife.. ? \n(SUDDEN PANIC) Where's my wife? Liz...? Is she hurt? Where is she --?! \nFARGE Doctor Harris, it's all right. The taxi you were in went into the river. You were the only passenger. Your heart stopped for six minutes. It is Thursday, November 27th. For four days you have been in a coma. \nMARTIN Thanksgiving... but my wife... she's in Berlin with me. Where is she? Why isn't she here? \nFARGE We didn't find any identification with you, Doctor Harris... the driver, who saved your life, disappeared soon after the accident and no one else has come forward. I must apologize, but we had no idea who you were. It sinks in. Martin shakes his head wretchedly. \nMARTIN Oh, Jesus... Liz doesn't know... She'll... she'll be worried sick. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nFARGE Calm down, Doctor Harris, please. Where can we reach your wife? Does she have a cell phone? \nMARTIN .Liz? \nINT. EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS \n. hallway leads into the spacious sitting room. No one there. Draped over a chair, Martin recognizes Liz's jacket. Martin smiles, blinks against tears, he's home. Sound of MOVEMENT from the BEDROOM DOOR... \nMARTIN Liz! I'm here, I... A HOTEL MAID appears from the bedroom door. Startled as she sees Martin... \nMARTIN (CONT'D) My wife... Meine Frau... I'm looking for Mrs. Harris... She suddenly gets him... nodding, pointing down. \nMAID Ah. Entpfang... reception... \nINT. HOTEL IMPERIAL, MEZZANINE LEVEL - NIGHT \nWorld MUSIC. GUESTS flow in through the ornate doors. Martin moves among them. Significantly under-dressed in his tattered jacket, the sutured head injury. Almost at the doors... when a hotel SECURITY GUARD intercepts him. \nGUARD Excuse me, sir. Do you have an invitation, sir? \nMARTIN No... I mean yes... Distracted, still looking at passing faces... \nMARTIN (CONT'D) I don't have it with me. My name's Harris, Dr. Martin Harris. I'm on the list. My wife is Elizabeth Harris. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN (CONT'D) I'm trying to find her. I've been in the hospital. As the guard checks a screen, a crop-haired man in a cheap suit nearby tracks them: HERR STRAUSS, head of hotel security. He approaches, also checks the screen as the guard speaks to him quietly in German. \nSTRAUSS Dr. Harris. Do you have any other identification? Passport? Drivers license? \nMARTIN I've already told this gentleman, I've been in the hospital. I was in an accident... Martin sees someone through the crowd... \nP.O.V. -- ENTERING FROM THE FAR DOOR a striking, intense-looking man with dark, wiry hair, a designer laptop bag slung over his shoulder. Smiling, arms around his two ten year old daughters, twin GIRLS, prettily dressed. Immediately the center of attention. People moving forward to meet him. Flashguns POP... MARTIN, raises his hand, calling out: \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Professor Bressler! Words lost in the noise. Martin pushes toward him. But: \nSTRAUSS I'm sorry, sir... \nMARTIN That's Professor Bressler, right there. He knows me, he can confirm who I am. \nSTRAUSS If you would be patient, sir. \nMARTIN No, I'm done being patient... Martin stops short. Staring past them: \nMARTIN (CONT'D) That's her, that's my wife. Over there. By the buffet table. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nP.O.V -- GLIMPSED THROUGH THE CROWD Liz. Looking superb in a black evening dress. In conversation with a group of men and women. \nMARTIN Seeing her. The look on his face. Processing... an overwhelming mixture of confusion and relief. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) That's her. That's Liz, my wife. Strauss stares at him blankly. Martin starts to lose it. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Look I have been missing for four days and she has no idea what happened to me! So you need to take me to her, right now. Heads are turning. A beat. Herr Strauss mutters to the guard, then beckons Martin to accompany him inside. \nMARTIN AND STRAUSS thread through the crush. Martin ignoring the glances he's getting. His eyes fixed on Liz... her back to him. A glass of wine in her hand... her golden hair... the ivory skin of her shoulders. Strauss taps her on the arm. She half turns... \nSTRAUSS Excuse me Madam. Your husband is here. He needs to -- \nMARTIN Liz... Liz turns fully. That beauty. A flash of surprise as she sees Martin. His clothes. The suture on his head. \nCONTINUED: (5) \nMARTIN (CONT'D) (to Liz, serious) It's not funny. I was hurt... Liz just stares at him, afraid, anchored to Martin B's arm. \nTNT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Seen through glass. A WALL OF MONITORS show images from around the hotel. Inside, Martin sits, surrounded. \nINT. SECURITY CONTROL ROOM - SAME \nMartin rocks in a chair; restless, hands knotted. A FEMALE DETECTIVE watches him. An OLDER DETECTIVE is on the phone. Strauss sits near him, studying him, while a TECHNICIAN fast- forwards 4-PANE video of the hotel reception area, the drive in front of the hotel... \nMARTIN There! Right there! ON THE VIDEO: Slowing to real-time. Liz, arriving at reception, speaking with the Receptionist, gesturing outside. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) That's Liz, and I... I must have been outside, I... I can't remember. The video plays on. Liz thanks the receptionist, leaves. \nSTRAUSS As you can see... you're not there. Martin STARES at him, helpless. The Older Detective hangs up the phone... \nOLDER DETECTIVE Immigration confirms the arrival of a Doctor and Mrs. Harris on November 23rd at 16.37. An hour later they checked into their suite at the Hotel. Martin breathes in. Chooses his words carefully. \nMARTIN He's not Martin Harris. I am Martin Harris. The man downstairs is pretending to be me. \nOLDER DETECTIVE And this impostor... may I ask? Did he also steal your wife? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Silence. Martin searching for a response. The hint of a smile on the female detective's face. \nMARTIN He's forcing her... he must have-- \nSTRAUSS -- but why? Exactly? .Why? There's no answer to that. Martin looks down. A beat. \nMARTIN This... this is insane. He stares at their faces. He calms himself, trying to get a grip. A memory resurfacing... \nMARTIN (CONT'D) My lab number... at Dartmouth... Call my assistant, she can verify who I am. Call her right now... He picks up a pad, scribbles down the number. Beat. The female detective picks up the phone, dials. She switches to speaker. RINGING TONE. CLICK. A recorded message... \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hello. This is 235-0535, the office of Doctor Martin Harris. If you're calling... The older detective presses \"off\". Martin recalling... \nMARTIN it's Thanksgiving... no one's going to be there till Monday... (racking his brain) Rod... Rodney Cole... he's a colleague. A friend. I know his number... 603-389-4457... Female detective dutifully dials the number. RINGING again. CLICK of a machine. Then a jovial male voice: \nVOICE (O.S.) \n(THROUGH PHONE) This is Doctor Cole. I'm having an out-of-office experience right now, so... leave a message. Click. Awkward SILENCE. Martin flailing... \nMARTIN Professor Bressler, talk to him. He's why I'm in Berlin. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSTRAUSS You want us to disturb a Nobel prize winning scientist, simply to attest to your story... when no crime has been committed? \nMARTIN But it has!... That man has taken everything from me, don't you see? You have to arrest him... \nSTRAUSS For what? Entering the country legally? Presenting all the correct documentation? ON ONE OF THE MONITORS: A view of the Rose Room: Liz and Martin B visible in the corner, dining. \nSTRAUSS (CONT'D) (off the monitor) .And sharing a hotel suite with his wife? Excuse me, your wife? \nMARTIN \n(EYES GLUED) She is my wife! \nOLDER DETECTIVE Even if she is your wife, sharing a room with her is not illegal. Not in Germany. \nFEMALE DETECTIVE (German, subtitled:) Look at her. Soon we'll have twenty more men claiming to be her husband. The room tries not to laugh, can't help smiling. The monitor image flips, now just a corridor. \nMARTIN \nMARTIN Rodney it's me, Martin. Rod, I'm in Berlin for the conference, but it's Liz. She's... I'm in trouble, Rod... Phone issues a DEMAND for more money. Martin fumbles for change, drops a crumpled ball of Euros into the GUTTER. \nINT. TRANSIT HOTEL - ROSENTHALER PLATZ - NIGHT \n'Hotel' is a charitable description. Martin counts out sodden bills, hands them to a WOMAN behind the desk. She in turn gives Martin a form to fill. \nWOMAN Fur Reisepaf3... passport... A beat. Martin looks at her, helpless. The woman sighs. Pushes back his money. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) Nicht Reisepal3, nicht Hotelzimmer. Police... very bad. \nEXT. TRANSIT HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER \nMartin exits, pulling dirty clothing closed against the cold. He scans the street, unnerved, frowns as he spots A BROWN RANGE ROVER, up the street, parked, idling. He squints, paranoid, checks the other way... His eyes lock on a lit S-BAHN station across the Platz. \nEXT. S-BAHN STATION BERLIN MITTE - NIGHT \nMartin pushes through the turnstiles, his footsteps echo in the empty tile corridor as his eyes play over the advertisements. Happy sexy Germans smile back at him... The SOUND OF FOOTSTEPS behind him, matching his. He slowly becomes aware, glances back. MARTIN'S P.O.V.: The empty corridor, curving away... Martin STOPS, listens... nothing. He starts to move again, aware that the delicate \"click\" of the following steps also begins again. UP AHEAD, the corridor straightens out at the train platform, several late-night travelers waiting. Martin begins to hurry... the FOOTSTEPS also increase in speed. Another sound: A TRAIN APPROACHING. Martin gives up cool, starts to run as the train barrels into the station, its noise eclipsing all sound. Doors open and Martin leaps in, turns to face the open door... .moments pass, the car's bell signals. Then a MAN appears, rushing from the corridor, one hand raised. \nMAN (German, subtitled:) Please! Hold the door! He's mild-faced, glasses, carrying a shopping bag in one hand. He FROWNS as Martin does nothing to stop the door. The two men stare through the glass as the train begins to move. The man shakes his head: foreigners. \nINT. S-BAHN TRAIN - NIGHT \nMartin shivers with cold and exhaustion, eyes play over the few passengers in the car... a nondescript man a few benches down who stares at him, then back to his paper. Martin eyes him, paranoid. Slowly gives up, lets his gaze plays over the adverts. Times, dates... Nov 26th. Memories reawakened... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Has to write something down. Fumbles in his jacket for his the copy of 'Horticus,' looking for a blank page to write on. A piece of CARD falls from between its pages. Something printed on one side. Martin flips it over, scribbles on the other: \"28th. Bressler. 12.30...\" Other times, dates, numbers. Everything he can remember... Sudden overwhelming fatigue. The roar of the train. VOICES. Lights racing by the windows. Martin's eyelids droop. Flickering. Closing... \nSUDDEN FLASH CUT - FRACTURED MEMORY... . LECTURE HALL, younger Liz in the audience. Students CLAPPING. Smiling older colleague SHAKING his hand... becoming... bees' WINGS swarming in their hive... YOUNG MARTIN watching mesmerized through a magnifying glass... their movement morphing into NAKED BODIES. Urgent, passionate. Martin and Liz making love. \nWHOMPF! SUDDEN SHIFT -- A HOTEL BEDROOM... . Liz towelling her hair. Only now it's dark, and cut short. Turns, smiles at him. Face close. Lips moving. \nLIZ Are you ready...? \nINT. S-BAHN TRAIN - MORNING \nMartin's eyes creak open. The train is still moving, but everything has changed. Morning passengers crowd the car, giving him space. An AMERICAN COUPLE, their bags tucked tight. The WIFE staring down at him. \nINT. S-BAHN BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMartin runs water, combs his hair with his fingers. Tries to press creases out of his stained suit. He stares into the graffiti-stained metal mirror of the bathroom. \nMARTIN Are you going to give up? \n(BEAT) okay. Solve the problem... \nINT. INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT \nMartin sits in front of a stickered and stained monitor, eyes glued to the screen as he types in an URL. The Dartmouth Mail website appears. Martin types in his login, password. \"Login failed. Please try again.\" \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Another attempt. Same results. He switches tactics. Types \"Martin Harris\" into Google... 605,000 results come back at him. On an impulse, he clicks \"IMAGES.\"... .page after page of men young and old. Getting married, posing, partying, historical illustrations... Behind Martin, door jingles, a YOUNG MAN comes into the cafe, seats himself across and to the side of Martin. Martin focuses, tries 'Martin Harris, Phd'... Cursor clicks. A new window opens. 'The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in Drakea pollination.' 'Research Faculty information: Dr. Martin Harris...' Contact numbers. No picture. He stares in disbelief... suddenly becomes AWARE of the man across: Young, nondescript, his head bobbing gently to whatever his Ipod earbuds are playing, staring into his computer... The young man looks over, meets Martin's eyes, holds for a long moment, small smile, looks back. Martin studies him for a moment, forces his gaze back to the page, the negation of his life on a small screen. \nTHE YOUNG MAN . Glances over again. Martin catching him. \nMARTIN Can I help you? Hello? The guy points to his headphones, shrugs. Martin STARES at his screen, ears listening for the tell tale sound of music seeping from the earbuds... nothing. Martin rises suddenly, looks to the bored ATTENDANT who nods towards the back. Martin moves past college kids on Facebook, to a dim back corridor, a door marked \"Manner,\" and what's he's looking for: a back door, cracked. \nEXT. ALLEY BEHIND THE INTERNET CAFE - NIGHT \nMartin slips into the alley, trots towards the street, glancing back. No one is following. He moves onto the street, waits at a light... eyes lock onto the familiar \"Ace Taxi\" logo of a taxi passing... \nSUDDEN FLASH OF MEMORY --: CARTWHEELING TAXI... Silent freefall dive. The 'Ace Taxis' logo... The face in the mirror. Looking back at him. Gina. Eyes meet... \nI /E. TAXI DEPOT - BUCHER STRASSE - EARLY MORNING Revving ENGINES. Echoing VOICES. Hunched against the drizzle, Martin pauses outside it. The playing card 'Ace Taxis' logo. Martin ducks under the open steel shutters... \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Please. Listen to me, I've been in the hospital, since the accident. My memory, it's... I don't remember what happened but something is going on and there are some people I need you to speak to. I need you to tell them what happened. Gina ducks back behind the counter. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Look, things have been happening to me. I think I'm being followed. That got her attention. Her eyes lift, scan outside. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) You're my only link to before everything went... \nGINA \n(MOVING AWAY) Crazy? \nMARTIN Yes, crazy... but it's true. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) The Owner is now.really watching. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) You have to help me -- She rounds on him. Patience snapping. Pushes through doors, gesturing him with her into... \nINT. KITCHEN, HASIR CAFE - CONTINUOUS \n.pots, pans, food bubbles. Immigrant cooks work, glace up but speak no English. Gina, really angry. \nGINA What do you expect me to do? I'm an illegal, driving a taxi without a permit, in an accident without insurance. If the cops catch up with me they'll throw me in jail. If I'm in jail, I lose everything, understand? If I'm in jail, they deport me. \nMARTIN You're not listening to me -- \nGINA No! It's you who is not listening. You're an American. Go to your fancy embassy. Go to the Police. There a million people here who will help you. \nMARTIN But you know who I am. \nGINA No, I don't. What's your name? \nMARTIN Martin Harris, Doctor M -- \nGINA Okay, fantastic, you're Martin Harris. You're whoever you say you are. Yes, I picked you up and we crashed. It doesn't mean I know who you are! She backs off, a hand raised against him. He STARES after her, the truth of what she's said hitting him. \nMARTIN \n(SUDDENLY) Where was I going? In the taxi? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGINA What...? (beat, softening) To the airport. Arrivals. You were in a hurry. \nMARTIN But I'd just arrived. It doesn't make any sense... She raises her hands, enough. He looks at her, takes in the bruise on her face. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) You got hurt, too. In the crash. (off her shrug) Thank you. For saving my life. Thank you. \nGINA You'd have done the same. \nMARTIN No. You can't be sure how you'll act. Not until something like that happens. \nGINA Well... I know me. I jump in without thinking. It causes me lot of trouble. She looks up at him. Meets his eyes square for the first time. Then... \nGINA (CONT'D) So please. Just leave me alone. He nods. She turns, pushes back into the restaurant. He watches her explaining to her boss... Then turns away, towards a back door. \nINT. US EMBASSY - MORNING \nFluorescent lights. Linoleum floor. Martin sits in a small plastic chair filling out paperwork. Alone. The place is closing early for the long weekend. A man opens a door, looks at Martin. Martin Harris? \nINT. OFFICE. US EMBASSY - DAY \nMARC SPIEGLER is German, fluent English. Patient, but wishing he was on his way home as well. He looks over Martin's paperwork as Martin places his watch and the \"Horticus\" book on the table. Where the form asks for a complaint, Martin has written \"Identity Theft.\" \nINT. BRESSLER'S LABORATORY - MORNING \nSurreal. Rows of head-height CORN in a large humid chamber under bright lights. Above, ancient rusting girders and brick. Insects HUM. RESEARCH STUDENTS clip seed spikelets, bagging and logging the samples. Martin slips quickly in through a door, unseen. Heat and moisture hitting him. Above the drone of bugs... VOICES. Martin tenses. He recognizes one of them... \nMARTIN B (O.C.) Drakea, named after Anthea Drake, the English botanist who wondered how it manages to reproduce when it doesn't appear to attract any insects... A wave of anger... that's Martin's work he's discussing! \nTHE OTHER SIDE OF THE LAB - MARTIN B WITH BRESSLER... \nBRESSLER It's puzzling, one wonders how -- Bressler stops talking. Stares past Martin B at MARTIN, heading toward them down a corn row, eyes burning. \nMARTIN Professor Bressler... Martin B turns, sees him. His eyes harden. But it's Bressler who speaks first. Alarmed, indignant: \nBRESSLER This laboratory is a restricted area. Who are you? \nMARTIN It's all right, Professor... \nMARTIN B What the hell are you doing here? \nBRESSLER You know this man? \nMARTIN B -- how did you get in here? Are you absolutely out of your mind? \nMARTIN Professor. He is not Martin Harris. I am Martin Harris. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: That's a conversation stopper. Bressler looks to Martin B... who shakes his head, embarrassed. Martin pointing: \nMARTIN B oh, Jesus... A phone RINGS somewhere in the room. It's picked up. \nBRESSLER So what is this? Some sort of hybridized propagation? There are two Martin Harrises? \nMARTIN B No... let me explain. This man showed up at the hotel last night. Security had to remove him. The police were called... \nMARTIN I called the police, you sonofabitch --! \nMARTIN B -- seems he checked himself out of the hospital. He was in an accident of some sort. . one of the research students CALLS to Bressler in German. Martin catches the word \"polizei\". A surge of panic. He looks around. Sees a straw he can grasp at... \nMARTIN Drakea Drakensis... Miss Drake was wrong... . the PLANT SAMPLE on the table behind Bressler. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) A single insect was attracted, but she couldn't see it. It's too small and it moves too fast. Thynnidae. It's a kind of wasp, but it looks like an ant. Only the males have wings. The orchid re-produces the pheromones of the female wasp to lure it in. It's a trick. It's pretending to be something it isn't... Bressler looks to Martin. Surprised... curious now. Martin sees his opening. Hope in his voice... \nMARTIN (CONT'D) We talked... you and I... on the phone... \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARTIN (CONT'D) we discussed your interest in alternative forms of propagation. I told you about my father, a school teacher... his passion for science... how he passed that on to me... \nMARTIN B -- I don't believe it! You've been listening to my calls? Just who the hell are you? \nMARTIN I said I'd like to do the same for my kids. You talked about your children... Two girls... right? Yeah... their -- His voice falters... tails off into silence. Searching his memory. Expression shifting to one of panic... \nMARTIN (CONT'D) You... you told me their names... I can't... I know them... I... Martin B picks up for him. Icy clarity: \nMARTIN B ... Laurel, and Lily. Martin frozen as Martin B goes on... \nMARTIN B (CONT'D) Twins... ten years old. The same age I was when I told my father I wanted to be a botanist. We discussed that on the phone, Professor... how I'd never seen him so happy. Martin sways on his feet, sweat beading... \nMARTIN No! That wasn't you. Don't you remember? We spoke of how brave our wives were to marry --- \nMARTIN B -- to marry scientists. I told you about our honeymoon -- \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. -- THE NURSE'S FACE FADING INTO... Far-off VOICES. Gurney MOVING beneath him. Looking up. Lights passing. RHYTHMIC SOUND of the wheels becoming... \nINT. MRI ROOM, WALDFRIEDE HOSPITAL - DAY \n.Claustrophobic nightmare; a support holds Martin's head rigid, earphones piping soothing CLASSICAL MUSIC, but the noise of the machine is all-engulfing. DUNN-DUNN-DUNN. The sound DEAFENING. Scanner moving over him... Martin's eyes empty... far far away. \nSMASH CUT INTO MEMORY - FRACTURED IMAGES... Undulating bodies moving over each other, Martin and Liz making love. Urgency building. Suddenly SHIFTING... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: . Martin B and Liz drinking in the hotel bar... she leaning over, whispering to him, intimate. \nBACK TO SCENE -- SUDDEN QUIET an abrupt jolt. Electric WHINE. Platform moves, sliding Martin out of the tube. His eyes open, take in the room. \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. -- TWO ORDERLIES .tending to him. One raises a needle, injects a CLOUDY SUBSTANCE into Martin's IV bag... .The MRI Control Booth, empty. Martin squints, a little confused. He raises his eyes, looks into the face of the man from the Internet Cafe! Call him JONES. \nMARTIN his mind struggles to compute. The sudden overwhelming realization that he's not insane. This man is HERE. His eyes DART as the other orderly glances over, the man from the train tunnel. Call him SMITH. He smiles at Martin, polite, nondescript. Ghostly in his disinterest. \nJONES Hello, Martin. This won't take very long. Martin tries to raise up but can't move -- his arms and legs are like lead. He opens his mouth to call out, his voice barely a murmur. His eyes lock on the IV bag, the steady drip... drip... down the line into his body... The two men quickly lift Martin, hefting him face-down onto a gurney. One arm dangles. \nMARTIN'S P.O.V.-- STRAIGHT DOWN -- The Men's shoes, thick soled, black. Linoleum Tile. Wheels of the gurney. -- Jones, stuffing his clothes and effects into a plastic bag, tossing them under the gurney. Smith pushing... \nNURSE (German, subtitles:) Excuse me, where are you taking this patient? Martin's vision RACKS, traces the Nurse's white sneakers, standing in the now open doorway to the room. Martin STRAINS to yell, to speak, nothing. He can just move his head enough to eyeball the IV. Drip... drip... drip... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJONES (German, subtitles:) We have instruction to move this patient to the American Hospital at Wiesbaden. Here are the papers. The rustle of paper. Martin CONCENTRATES, eyes on the IV tube, hanging between the bars of the gurney and his arm. Great Effort, He LEANS, pinching the tube closed. CLOSE ON THE IV: The drips... stop. \nNURSE (German, subtitles:) I'm surprised I wasn't informed... Let me check with -- A SOUND, like paper torn quick... and THE NURSE FALLS TO THE FLOOR, STARING UP AT MARTIN, \nHER THROAT CUT. Martin gazes down at her in HORROR as she bleeds out, staring upwards at him, the light in her eyes dying. Around him Smith and Jones start to MOVE, locking the door, opening cabinets, working fast, Martin's eyes lock on: a pair of scissors, tucked in her apron. Eyes watering, adrenaline surging, Martin WILLS his hand to reach down, palm the scissors, just as the Nurse's body is dragged away, leaving a trail of red... \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - DAY \nThe MRI ROOM door opens, the two 'orderlies' wheel the barely conscious Martin out into the corridor. Behind them, the room is spotless. They round a corner, almost at the EXIT... Doors ahead BLOW OPEN. Doctors, Paramedics rushing forward with various WOUNDED on gurneys. Something big has happened. Smith and Jones eye the madness coming their way, command decision, they duck into \nINT. PATIENT'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \n. where a feeble OLD MAN mumbles at them from his bed. They ignore the man, go about checking Martin. Jones lifts his head, pries open one eyelid after the other while Smith ties down his arms, covers him with a sheet. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Suddenly, the door OPENS. A DOCTOR, breathless. \nDOCTOR (German, subtitles:) You two. We need help!. Right now! (off their hesitation) \nCOME ON! NOW! No choice. They exit after the doctor, Jones glancing back at Martin as the door swings shut behind them. A beat. The covered shape on the gurney starts to MOVE. Martin's hand saws back and forth, using the scissors to cut the straps that bind him. ACROSS, the Old Man tracks the motion... scared. Success! A strap gives way. Martin paws the blanket weakly away. Feels along his arm, and pulls out the IV. Blood drips. He rises up, trying to orient... \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. -- FLARED, DISTORTED . the old MAN staring at him... DAZZLING daylight framed by a window... strange reverberating ECHOES... \nMARTIN . pulls himself upright. Tries to stand, but his body is like Jello. Reaches out, grabs the leg of a steel equipment trolley which TEETERS... CRASHES to the floor, showering Martin with a CASCADE of instruments and dressings. \nINT. RECOVERY ROOM (ALONG CORRIDOR) - SAME \nALARMS RING. Emergency team clusters around a lifeless PATIENT, working fast. Smith and Jones, resentfully holding drip bags. They heard that. Turn, eyes meeting. Set down their drip bags. Edge back toward the door... \nINT. HALLWAY, HOSPITAL - SAME \nSmith and Jones, hurrying down the hall. Quick check into the patient's room reveals Martin GONE, the old man GESTURING, panicked... They moves on, fast, around a corner into... \nINT. HOSPITAL E.R. RECEIVING AREA - CONTINUOUS \nVery busy. Patients... doctors and nurses. Smith and Jones push into the room, scanning... see: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJURGEN (CONT'D) He forgot. Germans are experts at forgetting. We forgot we were Nazis. Now we've forgotten forty years of Communism. All gone. But it's not just history that's forgotten. It's people, too. He sinks into a chair. Tired smile. \nJURGEN (CONT'D) But enough of me... \nLATER -- SMOKE RISES FROM A CIGARETTE Jurgen jots notes in a pad. Hand unsteady, he perches his cigarette on the ashtray, picks up the 'Horticus'. \nMARTIN I always have it with me. It was a gift from my father... Jurgen flips it open. Notices the inscription, the NUMBERS written inside the front endpaper. A beat. \nJURGEN These mean anything to you? \nMARTIN No. It's my wife's handwriting. \nJURGEN So, they mean something to her. He looks to Martin. Direct. \nJURGEN (CONT'D) Her involvement in this. There must have been something... in the past... some indication? A beat. Martin shakes his head, at a loss. Jurgen leafs on... the piece of CARD drops from between the pages. Jurgen picks it up. Martin's notations from the night before in the train: times... dates... places. \nMARTIN My schedule... for this week. It's everything I remember. Jurgen turns over the card. German print. A cheery cartoon Uncle Sam: 'Uncle Sam's Bowling & Billiards'. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) My friend Rodney Cole told us to go, said it was a blast. \nLATER STILL -- JURGEN Tapping his pencil on the pad... intrigued. \nJURGEN Passport, credit cards, family photos... things like these take time to prepare. You say this man has detailed knowledge of your research, of your relationship with... \nMARTIN Professor Bressler. He knows everything... \nJURGEN Including the fact that you were going to have a random accident that would allow him seamlessly to take your place? These people may be good, but they're not God. The question is, why would they want to take your place? What could they gain from being you? \nMARTIN They tried to kill me. \nJURGEN Yes, did you a favor I'd say. Now you have... Redlichkeit... Now you know you are right. \nMARTIN Do you believe me? A beat. Jurgen pours them both another brandy. \nJURGEN In the Stasi, we had a basic principle: Ask enough questions and a man who is lying will eventually change his story. But a man who tells the truth cannot change his, however unlikely his story sounds. I believe you are telling the truth, Doctor Harris. A long beat. Jurgen closes the notebook. \nJURGEN (CONT'D) I'll start by calling these numbers again... as you say, it's Thanksgiving... \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nJURGEN (CONT'D) and there's the time difference, so it may take time to make contact. And then there is the question... \nMARTIN of money... ? \nJURGEN Yes. Of money. Martin takes off his Rolex. Sets it on the table. \nMARTIN It's all I have. I'll pay you in cash as soon as I can. Jurgen nods, picks up the watch. Turns it, looks at the engraving on the back. As Martin turns to leave... \nJURGEN Doctor Harris... A wince of pain as Jurgen gets up. Lifts a tea tin off the shelf. Opens it. Takes out a hundred Euros... \nJURGEN (CONT'D) A loan against your guarantee. \nMARTIN Thank you. \nJURGEN I'll need twenty-four hours. Call me tomorrow afternoon. Do you have a place to stay? A long beat. Off Martin's FACE... \nINT. HASIR CAFE - NIGHT \nMARTIN We have to go up... He starts to pull her, but she's FROZEN, staring in horror. Martin tracks her gaze: Biko's body, tucked under the stairs. Lifeless eyes stare back. \nEXT. GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS \nImmigrant families emerge from the flaming building. Jones stands next to the Range Rover, eyes tracking the crowd, the upper floors, now engulfed in flame... \nEXT. ROOF TOP, GINA'S APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS \nMartin and Gina emerge at the top, run to the edge. He LEANS... reaching across to the next building... BELOW HIM: Five flights down. A mortal fall. Martin's hands grip a ledge, pull him over. He reaches back, pulls her across. They keep moving... \nEXT. STREET, KREUZBERG DISTRICT - CONTINUOUS \nCrowds parting as FIRE TRUCKS scream around the corner. Smith comes out, the last to exit the building. He meets eyes with Jones, satisfied. \nDOWN THE STREET Martin and Gina emerge from the neighboring building. See Smith climbing into the Range Rover. Martin takes Gina's arm, steers her away. Notices an old Mercedes Diesel taxi at the curb, covered in debris. Biko's. \nMARTIN The keys. Where are the keys? Gina stares at him, lost. Martin reaches into her pockets. Finds Biko's keys. He HAULS broken panes, debris off the car, manages to get it open. He bundles her inside. \nINT. TAXI - CONTINUOUS \nMartin fumbles the key into the ignition. He turns it. Warning light delay as the diesel's glow-plugs warm up. \nMARTIN C'mon. C'mon... IN THE REARVIEW: The Range Rover, making a U-Turn, heading their way... \nINT. RANGE ROVER - SAME \nJones drives, Smith shotgun. They cruise slowly, keeping an eye peeled. Pass the debris-covered taxi, empty. They keep moving, gaze still tracking. Smith pops his cell phone. \nI./E. TAXI/KREUZBERG DISTRICT STREETS - SAME Crouched down, Martin watches in the mirror as the Range Rover turns a corner. He restarts the engine, puts the car in gear and pulls them away from the curb. Gina still in stunned silence. Wipes tears and grime off her face. She looks across at Martin. He glances up at the mirror... sudden change in his expression. Gina turns, sees... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBEHIND THEM -- THE BROWN RANGER ROVER Four cars back. Jones driving. Smith riding shotgun. Faces expressionless as they swerve out into traffic, deftly cut back in one vehicle closer to Martin and Gina. Gina turns back to Martin. Eyes wide. This can't be happening. Adrenaline clearing her mind... \nGINA Left --! Turn left... Martin spins the wheel. Taxi swerves across oncoming traffic into a SIDE-STREET. Gina waving frantically... \nGINA (CONT'D) Left again! Left again! Now right. Here. HERE! Just in time, Martin pulls a right. Cab drifts, SLAMS a wall side-on... bounces back into the center of the road. \nGINA (CONT'D) Jesus! A look from Martin: What? Gina glances behind. No sign of them. Moment's relief. Turns to her right. Sees the RANGE ROVER racing down the parallel side-street... \nGINA (CONT'D) They're going to cut us off! Right. Turn right -- ! Martin SCREECHES into a turn. Heads for the parallel alley. Range Rover FLASHES through the intersection just ahead. Taxi cuts across feet behind them... \nIN THE RANGE ROVER Jones spots the taxi in the mirror. BRAKES, high speed 180... races back up the alley. \nIN THE TAXI Martin floors the gas.

Closed GATES at the far end... . Range Rover moving fast down the street alongside the cemetery. Suddenly cutting left across traffic. Bounces over the curb, full-speed into the grounds. 4WD slaloming past gravestones, rapidly closing on the taxi... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Closed gates ahead. No choice. Martin puts his foot down. SMASHES through the gates. Flying hinge SLAMS the windshield -- glass instantly spidering opaque... Martin driving blind. Careens against the embankment, WHIPLASHES up, spin on its axis. Rolling... over the edge of the embankment, TUMBLING over and over. SLAMS DOWN right way up, axles crumpling. QUIET. Steaming HISS of the engine. Martin's hands still locked on the wheel. Gina next to him. Martin shoves open the door. Clambers out. \nEXT. BERLIN RAIL YARDS - CONTINUOUS \nA maze of tracks and power lines below street level. S-Bahn, U-Bahn, high-speed ICE trains, freight... tracks disappearing in each direction into tunnels. A sound. Martin turns, looks up... THE RANGE ROVER, Jones at the wheel... SPOTS THEM. Engine GUNS, Range Rover plunges headlong down the embankment... Whistling ROAR... as a HIGH SPEED TRAIN hurtles out of the one of the tunnels. Martin grabs Gina's hand. \nMARTIN C'mon...! Running side-by-side. Train horn BLASTS as they cross right in front of it as the Range Rover, cut off, SPINS 90 degrees, races down the tracks alongside it. Martin and Gina scramble across tracks, towards a tunnel... . the Range Rover passes the back of the train. HARD right, over the tracks. Too Fast. The car catches air... . BELLIES down hard onto the next set of tracks. Front tire EXPLODES... . Range Rover SPINS... rear wheels SLAM into the track. Another tire BURSTS. Scraping STOP, car straddling the rails. Jones shifts into reverse. Rims SPIN against metal. \nACROSS THE TRACKS . Martin and Gina sprinting towards the tunnel. Smith jumps out of the Range Rover, lines his weapon. BLAM! BLAM! \nINSIDE THE TUNNEL Martin and Gina hit the ground, bullets chipping ceramic off the walls. Up ahead, illuminated, some utility stairs. Gina GASPS air, spent. Martin looks behind them... \nMartin's eyes flick open and the SOUND and LIGHT of the club come flooding back in... \nMARTIN'S P.O.V. -- GINA. UNDRESSING Low, moving lights pass across her body, wifebeater undershirt and jeans. She unzips the jeans, pulls them down long legs, pulls off the wifebeater, no bra... . hesitates. Looks back, sees that Martin is watching her. Beat. Beat. Lights catch glimpses of her body, her breasts, the arch of her back. She turns slightly away from him, pushes a pile of borrowed clothing towards him. A heavy coat, some jeans. \nGINA .Put these on. She pulls a mod shirt on, glances back as he now undresses. \nGINA (CONT'D) Were you happy? He looks up, shirt in his hands. She doesn't waiver. \nGINA (CONT'D) Your marriage? Was it happy? \nMARTIN .Yes. I think so... I don't remember... how it felt exactly. She approaches him, leans in so she can see his eyes... \nGINA So why would she do this to you? \nMARTIN .For the same reason I would. If I thought it was the only way to protect her. Gina nods, distant. Martin presses on, difficult. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) I keep having a dream. Liz is in the bedroom of our home, although it's different somehow. Her hair's different... she's smiling, about to say something. Then it ends. I can remember places, details... \n(BEAT) \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN (CONT'D) I just can't remember... how I felt. He stops. Just the low pulsing BEAT from the other room The lights revolving over them. Gina watching him. Looking back at her. That connection again. He looks away. She shakes it off, produces a borrowed joint, offers it to him. He shakes his head no. She shrugs, sparks it. Inhales deeply, eyes close. She leans back. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) You'll need to get out of town. There's a man who's helping me. He can -- \nGINA (seems to ignore him) In Bosnia... It was not like you probably imagine. It was nice. .there were cherry blossoms. \n(BEAT) One day, I was sixteen. My sister and my brother came to me and said hey let's play hide and seek, down by the creek. He had ten Marka for whoever won. It was amazing, the way he just said it... Beat. She raises the joint, hits it again. Her eyes open, but she's deep in the memory and it's intense. \nGINA (CONT'D) .So I went down to this place I knew, under the small bridge over the creek. And I hid and waited. Not really that long... Then I went back home, to find my brother and collect my money. \n(BEAT) He, and my father and my uncle were dead. And so was my mother. My sister was alive... for a little while. She turns her head, eyes blaze straight at Martin. \nGINA (CONT'D) It was not enough, to kill us. They wanted us to remember, every day, for the rest of our lives. \nMARTIN We're you... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGINA What? Raped? \n(BEAT) No. No one touched me. But now... I'm not going anywhere. I'm not running anymore. She nestles in under his arm. Closes her eyes. He lets his hand gently stroke her hair. \nMARTIN I won't let anything happen to you. \nGINA \n(SMILES SLEEPY) Liar... Say it again. \nMARTIN I'll protect you. She opens her eyes again, looks up at him, smiles, on her way to sleep. \nGINA .Cool. \nCHILL SPACE - LATER Gina sleeps, at peace. Martin leans over the one object he has left, his copy of \"Horticus.\" He studies the number markings on the flap, working... \nEXT. BERLIN VELODROME - DAY \nVast windowless cylindrical building on the city's edge. \nMARTIN Yes. Bressler invited him... Martin trails off. Starting to get there... \nJURGEN Martin Harris... with just a few guests, in a confined space with Prince Fahad. For some, that might be a very good reason to want to be you. \nMARTIN Oh, Jesus... You can't -- Jurgen flips his notebook shut. Gets up. \nJURGEN -- I need a few more hours. You need to go somewhere you will not be seen. Then meet me outside the Cafe Adler on the Kochstrasse. 6.30 sharp. \nEXT. NEUKOLLN DISTRICT, BERLIN - DAY \nMartin and Gina thread their way through streets teeming with AFRICAN and MIDDLE EASTERN immigrants, music blasting from storefronts. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: An ELECTRONICS STORE.

We have to do what Jurgen said, stay out of -- She starts to pull him away, but he's not moving. He's staring at the pre-paid cell phones on display. \nMARTIN Jurgen may have nothing. (beat, to her) I need your help. \nINT. EISNENHOWER SUITE, HOTEL IMPERIAL - DAY \nLiz sits in front of the bedroom vanity in her bra and skirt, putting on makeup. The room's shower is on. CLOSE as she applies mascara. The Camera searches her face, her small gestures, looking for clues... Shower stops. IN DEEP FOCUS behind her, Martin B comes out of the bathroom, nude. He picks a robe up off the bed, pulls it on as he approaches her, places his hands on her shoulders. They stare at each other in the vanity mirror... RING! RING! Martin B picks up the phone. \nMARTIN B Dr. Harris speaking. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) \n(GERMAN ACCENT) Yes, hello, Dr. Harris. This is Else Adlam from Dr. Bressler's office.

Looking down at the cover... \"The role of Gorytini and Thynnidae in Drakea pollination\" by Martin Harris, PhD. He slides the bound photocopy next to it. \"The process of Drakea pollination\" by Laurence Darnell, University of Wisconsin. A long beat. The two titles side-by-side. Sudden thought... Jurgen takes something out of his pocket; the card that was inside Martin's 'Horticus'. The scribbled schedule notations on one side... turns it over: the bowling alley's Uncle Sam logo. Jurgen holds closer, studying it. His mind clicking... . printed German text. A number: 21. And right at the bottom, a small time-clock stamp... \nEXT. TIERGARTEN PARK -- DAY \nMartin and Gina stand amidst a flow of tourists and locals, near the entrance to Berlin's equivalent of Central Park and its zoo. Across, the Weinhaus Restaurant is a fin-de-siecle style brasserie bordering the avenue. \nGINA Why here? \nMARTIN .The zoo. She loves Polar Bears. I never knew exactly why. Gina nods, looks over to the restaurant. Looks back at Martin who hasn't moved. She checks her watch. \nGINA Okay, go. You're going to be late for your date. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Martin nods, heads into the park. Long, curving paths bordered by green. A labyrinth. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Martin B catches a waiter's eye, signals for the check. Bressler catches this, looks to Martin B, questioning. \nMARTIN B I'm sorry, it's my fault. Another appointment I forgot. \nBRESSLER It doesn't matter. (jumping back in) But see you, you say I am too cautious. It's an idiot thing to say. I'm a realist! \nEXT.

FACES us. \nMARTIN Standing across from her in this protected space. A strange numbness. Doesn't know where to start... \nMARTIN . Liz. Just that syllable. She stares back, features tense. \nLIZ What are you doing here? \nMARTIN Liz. What's happening? \nLIZ You're crazy -- you have to leave me alone. \nMARTIN Why --?: I have to know why, Liz.

JURGEN'S APARTMENT - SAME \nJURGEN \n(INTO PHONE:) I appreciate it, Herr Cole... Puts the phone down. A beat. Another look at the airport scans of Martin. Studying them a moment.

Reaches inside. The contents hidden from us... a shadow of tension crosses his face. Then a slow, enigmatic smile. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA LITTLE LATER -- A KETTLE BOILING... . the mournful HOWL of its whistle. Jurgen turns off the gas. Spoons Nescafe into a mug. Opens a closet, reaches over a musty clutter of jars and boxes... finds a rusted sugar tin. Inside is a single ancient sachet of sweetener. A beat, pensive. He tears it open, adds it to the Nescafe. He looks up. Listening for... anticipating... . the lively KNOCK at his door. \nTHE HALLWAY Jurgen opens the door... it's RODNEY COLE, grinning... shaking rain from his coat. \nCOLE Herr Jurgen? \nJURGEN Dr. Cole... Please, come on in. Jurgen ushers him in. Leads them into the living room. \nJURGEN (CONT'D) Drink?

I'm making some for myself. \nCOLE I'm good. Thanks. Cole looks around the tiny apartment. Sees the framed photos on the mantel. Looks closer. \nCOLE (CONT'D) You were in the military? \nJURGEN The Stasi. In East Germany. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nWOMAN May I see some identification? She looks up. Martin's expression distant... \nGINA He doesn't have any. He was in an accident, that's why the bag was unclaimed... \nMARTIN The combination. For the lock. It's 2... 8... 0... 6... A beat. The woman and Gina both looking at Martin. The woman enters the numbers. The locks pop open. She lifts the lid, picks something up. A pause... then her expression softens. She turns it toward Martin... \nTHE BRIEFCASE Filled with personal effects. Sitting on top a US passport. A long beat. Martin's hands unsteady as he opens it... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: His photo. And his name... Doctor Martin Harris. \nINT. AIRPORT CAFE -- LATE AFTERNOON \nNoisy and busy. Gina uneasy... watching Martin as he carefully examines each item in the case. Everything familiar, yet strange. His, but somehow not his. a copy of 'Scientific American' magazine, a comb, some gum, a Newark Airport parking ticket. His published paper -- the same edition Jurgen found at the library. his leather wallet. Martin studies it. Identical to the one Martin B had. Opens it... \nCLOSE -- THE WALLET New Hampshire Driver's license. Credit cards. Martin fumbles inside a pocket, pulls out... . the EXACT SAME PHOTO we saw in Bressler's lab of a younger Liz with a younger Martin B in Paris. Except this time it's a younger Martin beside Liz-in the photo. \nMARTIN gazing at it. He runs his fingers over its dock-eared corners, every bump and crease. Looks up to find Gina watching him. A long, awkward pause. She reaches over. Takes the photo from him. Studies it. \nGINA Can you remember now... how you felt? Martin's silence hangs in the noise and activity around them. Gina handing back the photo. He stares down at Liz again as Gina stands, start to collect her things... \nGINA (CONT'D) We shouldn't stay here, it's not safe for you... Her voice trails off as she looks at Martin, really sees him in this moment. He looks up at her, torn, back down at the pictures, the relics of his life, his memories, spread out in front of him. He glances at the clock: 2:55... Gina tracks his gaze... gets it, takes a step back... \nGINA (CONT'D) Oh, God. I'm an idiot. She's meeting you here. Martin meets her gaze, open book. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARTIN .Yes. I'm sorry. Yes. She's my wife. She's in danger. I have to -- \nGINA (nodding, auto-pilot) That's good. I'm happy for you. I have to go. \nMARTIN No, wait. I meant what I said. We can take care of you. I can get you money, arrange -- \nGINA \n(FIERCE ) Stop. Be quiet. You've got what you wanted. You don't need me anymore and in case \"we've\" forgotten, I take care of myself very well. She starts for the door. Martin getting up... \nMARTIN Gina stops, turns. A beat. Sadness, anger. \nGINA One kiss and suddenly... Everything that's happened? To Biko? To us? -- I know, she's your wife. Like I said, I'm an idiot. \n(BEAT) Goodbye, Martin. She turns away again.

KOCHSTRASSE - SAME \nMartin pushes them into the alley next to cafe, jams the bag into her arms. \nMARTIN Take this... get out of Berlin. Gina shaking her head. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Take it and go! Get as far away from me as you can. \nGINA I'm not leaving you! Listen to me: Maybe you're not the man who went into the water. But you are the man I pulled out... Martin, staring into his reflection on the wet street... \nGINA (CONT'D) Martin, there's no way you can show your face at the hotel. Everyone is looking for you. I \nCAN -- WHAM! MARTIN LURCHES UP AT GINA! He SLAMS her back against the brick wall, his hand around her neck, cutting off her air, literally lifting her feet off the ground. \nMARTIN \n(THE MONSTER) Look at me. Look at me... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Gina SPUTTERS, tries to draw air. Her eyes LOCK on his. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) .Is this what you want? Is this the person you still want to help. \n(SQUEEZING TIGHTER) You should have let me drown... She sputters, eyes start to roll back in her head, losing consciousness. Martin RELEASES and she drops in the dirt water of the Alley, hands and knees, GASPING for breath. Martin stares down at her. He picks up the bag, drops it in front of her face... \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Pure instinct and adrenaline. Gina grabs the bag, stumbles across the street, HORNS BLARE as cars swerve to avoid her...

Perhaps my wife -- BRESSLER, held at the door by Fahad's security, searching his pockets for an invitation. \nBRESSLER (CONT'D) I'm late. Very un-German of me. \nFARAD (to his security) I don't think the professor needs an invitation. He is, after all, the reason we are all here. \n(CONTINUED) \nLIZ \n(LOUD) Oh thank God you're here! Martin stares at her in horror as she beams up at him. One hand caressing his cheek... .her other hand pressing a knife against his chest. \nGINA Seeing Martin and Liz, embracing. Confused. Alarmed. Hurt. \nLIZ AND MARTIN Liz still hugging him tight, whispering hard, her free hand sliding something metallic into his pocket. \nLIZ (CONT'D) Hello, Martin. I just placed a gun in your jacket pocket. One bullet. There's really only one person, one right way to kill Bressler now, isn't there? The crazy man whose been stalking him, the crazy man who pretended to be Martin Harris... \nMARTIN No... \nLIZ Oh, and after you've shot him, point the gun at the Police. \nMARTIN I won't do it... \nLIZ God you're weak. The 'Martin' I knew wouldn't have been able to go on living like you are. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) Her eyes duck, purposeful, he tracks her gaze.

Look at it this way: I'm giving you a chance to save most of them. You can be the hero... A kiss, sexy. Gina in the background, taking a step back... \nLIZ (CONT'D) Ooops, bet you wish you could explain that. Time's up, Martin. Go finish what you came to Berlin for in the first place. On Martin. Caught. No play. He turns, walks... \nINT. BATHROOM, EISENHOWER SUITE - CONTINUOUS \nMartin B has a small hole opened up. He can see the digital timer. 00:00:14, 00:00:13...

Muffled TV and arguing VOICES in Turkish from the floor below. \nGINA The walls are made of cardboard... but it's home. Another smile, tired. A long beat. Abruptly, Gina gets up and leaves the room. Sound of drawers opening. \nGINA (O.S.)(CONT'D) You can sleep on the floor in there. I have an extra mattress. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: She reappears... tosses something to Martin.

Photographs on a cluttered vanity: Old country, Bosnia. Men in suits and women in long dresses. Children, a boy and two girls... Gina? \nIN THE KITCHEN Gina goes to the fridge, removes a pot of plain stew and sets it on the stove. She uses a spoon to pull off a chunk of fatty meat. Drops it on a chipped plate and opens the window... leaning out into the rain, Gina reaches up, slides the plate onto a sloping roof above. Excited YOWLS as stray cats come running from every direction. Gina ducks back inside, pulls the window shut, glances towards the cracked door to her bedroom as she ducks into the bathroom, turns on the hot water... \nGINA \n(CALLING OUT) The light's bust so you have to leave the door open if you want to see anything.

And don't forget to reset the meter. \nGINA You're the best. She pecks him on the cheek. Biko pushes in the door, just a little, but enough to catch Martin, in his undershirt, carrying the rest of his clothes, halfway to the shower. \nMARTIN I'm... I'm just going... in here. Biko looks at Gina, raises an eyebrow. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nGINA Yes, that's right. I sleep with every married American you send my way -- Thank you for that, by the way. \nBIKO Hey, no need to explain to me. \nGINA Get on your way! Go! She pushes him out, closes the door. The stew has started to SMOKE. Gina moves it off the burner. \nIN THE STAIRWELL Biko trots down stairs, laughing to himself. Passes two men, working on the PHONE BOX tucked below the stairs. \nBIKO (German, subtitled:) Hey, while you're at it, check the line to number eight. She's always getting bad service.

GINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nGina punches PLAY on an old boom-box and a cool Bosnian hip- hop groove plays. She spoons some of the stew into a bowl, sets it on the table. \nIN THE BATHROOM Martin lets the hot water run over his head, drip across his face, allowing himself a tiny moment of relaxation. \nIN THE KITCHEN BANG! BANG! Knocking on the door again. Gina puts the bowl in the sink, heads for the door. \nGINA Just a moment, Biko. And you're going to be late -- She throws open the door... SMITH and JONES press in! Jones clamping a hand over her mouth. Watching them work is awe-inspiring, chilling. There's no wasted motion whatsoever. Their faces calm, observant. Jones holds Gina, gun covers the dark entrance to the bathroom where the shower still runs as Smith turns the music up LOUD, then opens the oven, blows out the pilot light, turns on the gas... CLOSE ON THE GAS -- A hazy layer, rippling over the floor... Smith grabs a candle off Gina's table, lights its wick, sets it on top of the stove. \nIN THE DARK BATHROOM PRESSED against the wall, trapped, fully aware of what's _ going on, Martin. He's pulled on clothes. By looking in the small mirror over the sink, he can see the men going about their work. He can see their weapons. His eyes SEARCH for anything useful, anything at all. There's nothing. He reaches towards the small window to the exterior. It swings open, revealing the FIRE ESCAPE beyond. \nIN THE APARTMENT The gas HISSES as it spills into the room. Smith grabs the bottle of alcohol, douses Gina as with one hand Jones produces a hypodermic... . A LOW THUMP from the bathroom. Smith REACTS instantly, KICKS in the bathroom door, gun lined... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: . on NOTHING. The empty shower runs. The window to the exterior swings gently. \nGINA Terror-stricken, realizing Martin has abandoned her. Jones nods to Smith who goes out the door, covers the hall. Jones FLIPS Gina onto her stomach, presses her face to the floor, pulling down the top of her pants as he prepares to inject her with the hypodermic. She struggles, SCREAMS IN RAGE, chokes on the gas. Her EYES WIDEN as Jones slides the needle in, starts to PRESS... . CRASH! Martin blasts in from the fire escape, through the window nearest them, catching Jones in the face, cutting his face. He tumbles over -- his gun sliding away... \nMARTIN AND JONES . Tumble together, SMASH into the sideboard which collapses, splintering into the kitchen. Martin tries to hit Jones who easily deflects the blow, leaps cat-like to his feet, moving towards his gun as Smith re- enters, weapon drawn, and FREEZES, his eyes tracking: THE CANDLE, teetering on the stove... now falling over... rolling... Jones, Smith, Martin... all track the candle, its progress towards the edge of the stove... Jones and Smith RUN towards the door.

Martin covering Gina. PRESSURE WAVE sweeps over them, burning debris raining. \nFRACTURED VISION... TINNITUS DAZE... Fires spreading, the main room beyond the bedroom an INFERNO. Martin pulls Gina up. They move to the window and the fire escape. Gina begins to slide it open... \nMARTIN No, look! She tracks his gaze: Down below, Jones exits the building, looks up amidst other onlookers. Wipes blood from his face. Martin looks around, wild, for anything, his gaze settling on: the far wall. Flames FLARE in, growing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) With a ROAR Martin rushes the wall, IMPACTS it with his shoulder, goes right through! \nINT.

Cole glaring down at him. Disgusted. Smith covers Martin as Cole moves into the van, empties out a junkie's works: dropper with needle, bottle top, cotton balls, lighter. Expertly cooks up a fix of brown heroin. Draws it into the syringe, glancing back: \nCOLE (CONT'D) Look at you now. Nobody. A no- one. Just another dead junkie...

Gina, really angry. \nGINA What do you expect me to do? I'm an illegal, driving a taxi without a permit, in an accident without insurance. If the cops catch up with me they'll throw me in jail. If I'm in jail, I lose everything, understand? If I'm in jail, they deport me. \nMARTIN You're not listening to me -- \nGINA No! It's you who is not listening. You're an American. Go to your fancy embassy. Go to the Police. There a million people here who will help you. \nMARTIN But you know who I am. \nGINA No, I don't. What's your name? \nMARTIN Martin Harris, Doctor M -- \nGINA Okay, fantastic, you're Martin Harris. You're whoever you say you are. Yes, I picked you up and we crashed. It doesn't mean I know who you are! She backs off, a hand raised against him. He STARES after her, the truth of what she's said hitting him. \nMARTIN \n(SUDDENLY) Where was I going? In the taxi? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nGINA What...? (beat, softening) To the airport. Arrivals. You were in a hurry. \nMARTIN But I'd just arrived. It doesn't make any sense... She raises her hands, enough. He looks at her, takes in the bruise on her face. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) You got hurt, too. In the crash. (off her shrug) Thank you. For saving my life. Thank you. \nGINA You'd have done the same. \nMARTIN No. You can't be sure how you'll act. Not until something like that happens. \nGINA Well... I know me. I jump in without thinking. It causes me lot of trouble. She looks up at him. Meets his eyes square for the first time. Then... \nGINA (CONT'D) So please. Just leave me alone. He nods.

US EMBASSY - DAY \nMARC SPIEGLER is German, fluent English. Patient, but wishing he was on his way home as well.

As I explained to the last guar -- who went home by the way -- it's not about Credit Cards. Someone has taken over my identity. Someone is pretending to be me. Here. In Berlin.

I need a new passport, papers to prove -- Spiegler sighs, a mixture impatience and sympathy. \nSPIEGLER Why do they believe the other man? \nMARTIN Because... Because my wife. He's staying with my wife. They must be forcing her -- Spiegler suppresses a small laugh, looks away. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) You don't think I know how it sounds? Let me ask you this, if my wife was having some hot and heavy affair with another man, why not just leave me? Why this? After all, we're in Europe, right? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Spiegler burns, nods. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) Look, I need a passport.

If you come back then -- \nMARTIN Monday?! They've kidnappedmy wife. You need to find out who this other man is, you need to be in contact with my wife -- Spiegler exhales, cuttint Martin off. He picks up Martin's Rolex, glances at the initials. Looks at his copy of 'Horticus', the inscription on the inside cover. As he does, a slip of paper comes loose, Martin picks it up. \nSPIEGLER You understand, we're not a detective agency, we... Spiegler stops, sensing Martin isn't listening anymore. Martin's staring at the slip of paper where on one side is scribbled: \"28th. Bressler. 12.30 pm...\" \nMARTIN I have a meeting with Bressler... \nSPIEGLER What? \nMARTIN \n(COLLECTING THINGS) Never mind. You've been very unhelpful.

I have an appointment at 12.30... I'm late... The female RECEPTIONIST behind the desk consults her screen. Beat. Frowns. \nRECEPTIONIST Your name please? \nMARTIN Dr. Martin Harris. The professor knows who I am. We scheduled this meeting weeks ago. \nRECEPTIONIST The professor knows you? \nMARTIN Well, we haven't met, but we've been corresponding. He invited me here to discuss my thesis. Dr. Martin Harris... She frowns, rises from the desk. \nRECEPTIONIST Wait here please. \nMARTIN Is there some sort of problem? No answer, she disappears into a back office. Martin shakes his head, exasperated. He scans the building plan on the wall... 'Bressler. L.P - Molekulare Botanik - 305'...

Stares past Martin B at MARTIN, heading toward them down a corn row, eyes burning. \nMARTIN Professor Bressler... Martin B turns, sees him. His eyes harden. But it's Bressler who speaks first. Alarmed, indignant: \nBRESSLER This laboratory is a restricted area. Who are you? \nMARTIN It's all right, Professor... \nMARTIN B What the hell are you doing here? \nBRESSLER You know this man? \nMARTIN B -- how did you get in here? Are you absolutely out of your mind? \nMARTIN Professor. He is not Martin Harris. I am Martin Harris. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: That's a conversation stopper. Bressler looks to Martin B... who shakes his head, embarrassed. Martin pointing: \nMARTIN B oh, Jesus... A phone RINGS somewhere in the room. It's picked up. \nBRESSLER So what is this? Some sort of hybridized propagation? There are two Martin Harrises? \nMARTIN B No... let me explain. This man showed up at the hotel last night. Security had to remove him. The police were called... \nMARTIN I called the police, you sonofabitch --! \nMARTIN B -- seems he checked himself out of the hospital. He was in an accident of some sort. . one of the research students CALLS to Bressler in German. Martin catches the word \"polizei\". A surge of panic. He looks around. Sees a straw he can grasp at... \nMARTIN Drakea Drakensis... Miss Drake was wrong... . the PLANT SAMPLE on the table behind Bressler. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) A single insect was attracted, but she couldn't see it. It's too small and it moves too fast. Thynnidae. It's a kind of wasp, but it looks like an ant. Only the males have wings. The orchid re-produces the pheromones of the female wasp to lure it in. It's a trick. It's pretending to be something it isn't... Bressler looks to Martin. Surprised... curious now. Martin sees his opening. Hope in his voice... \nMARTIN (CONT'D) We talked... you and I... on the phone... \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARTIN (CONT'D) we discussed your interest in alternative forms of propagation. I told you about my father, a school teacher... his passion for science... how he passed that on to me... \nMARTIN B -- I don't believe it! You've been listening to my calls? Just who the hell are you? \nMARTIN I said I'd like to do the same for my kids. You talked about your children... Two girls... right? Yeah... their -- His voice falters... tails off into silence. Searching his memory. Expression shifting to one of panic... \nMARTIN (CONT'D) You... you told me their names... I can't... I know them... I... Martin B picks up for him. Icy clarity: \nMARTIN B ... Laurel, and Lily. Martin frozen as Martin B goes on... \nMARTIN B (CONT'D) Twins... ten years old. The same age I was when I told my father I wanted to be a botanist. We discussed that on the phone, Professor... how I'd never seen him so happy. Martin sways on his feet, sweat beading... \nMARTIN No! That wasn't you. Don't you remember?

Martin B suddenly seems to SNAP. \nMARTIN B (CONT'D) This is my wife we're talking about! My father, whom I loved. You may think it's funny, but it's my life. Whatever sick pleasure this gives you -- I'm tired of it. I'm done. You need to... STOP. Martin just STARES at the Martin B who's shaking, upset. Like looking in a mirror that has taken your emotions. \nMARTIN I... this isn't happening... . the POLICE suddenly there. Two OFFICERS. Bressler signals for them to stay back.

Flinches at the glare. \nFARCE The police brought you here. The mistake was mine. I should never have let you leave. Martin blinks, bleary. Farge talks briefly to the nurse in German. She nods, starts prepping a hypodermic at a table. Farge looks back to Martin. Explains gently: \nFARGE (CONT'D) Confusion... memory loss... the complete or partial loss of identity... these are common stages in recovery. Some temporary, others longer term. We're going to do an MRI. Try to find out what's happening. Martin stares out the window, not fighting, hardly listening. A bird alights on a branch. \nFARGE (CONT'D) The mind is like a jigsaw puzzle. The pieces fit together to create the person we are. With major trauma, the puzzle is shattered. But the brain's ability to recover is remarkable. The mind needs a narrative, an identity... a soul. Without memory, without a past, we are nothing. In the coma state, memories are rebuilt. In some cases the pieces move. In others they go missing. And sometimes... completely new pieces are found. The bird flies off. Martin's eyes track... empty. \nFARGE (CONT'D) Comas sometimes perform a kind of alchemy. A patient awakes convinced of a reality that was previously only fantasy. \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFARGE (CONT'D) New men, in effect, with new lives... new loves. \nMARTIN Doctor...

Martin looks over, Farge almost RECOILS at the intensity in Martin's eyes. Fear. Loss. Anger. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) \n(ALMOST CALM) It's like a war, between what you know... He taps his forehead. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) .and what you believe. His hand moves down his body to his chest, taps his heart. He LEANS towards Farge. \nMARTIN (CONT'D) .who do you think wins?

Muffled TV and arguing VOICES in Turkish from the floor below. \nGINA The walls are made of cardboard... but it's home. Another smile, tired. A long beat. Abruptly, Gina gets up and leaves the room.

But the Owner's voice falters. \nINT. GINA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMartin sets the borrowed clothing down on the bed, looks around himself as he takes off his jacket. Intimate, to be in here. Photographs on a cluttered vanity: Old country, Bosnia. Men in suits and women in long dresses. Children, a boy and two girls... Gina? \nIN THE KITCHEN Gina goes to the fridge, removes a pot of plain stew and sets it on the stove. She uses a spoon to pull off a chunk of fatty meat. Drops it on a chipped plate and opens the window... leaning out into the rain, Gina reaches up, slides the plate onto a sloping roof above. Excited YOWLS as stray cats come running from every direction. Gina ducks back inside, pulls the window shut, glances towards the cracked door to her bedroom as she ducks into the bathroom, turns on the hot water... \nGINA \n(CALLING OUT) The light's bust so you have to leave the door open if you want to see anything.

And your whole life... has been erased?\" He STARES at her, moved. That connection again. He looks away. Looks back again... \nGINA (CONT'D) What is it? \nMARTIN Your eyes... It's the one thing I remember about the accident. Your eyes in the mirror... He tails off. Face-to-face... BANG! BANG! Pounding on the door.

GINA'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nGina punches PLAY on an old boom-box and a cool Bosnian hip- hop groove plays. She spoons some of the stew into a bowl, sets it on the table. \nIN THE BATHROOM Martin lets the hot water run over his head, drip across his face, allowing himself a tiny moment of relaxation. \nIN THE KITCHEN BANG! BANG! Knocking on the door again. Gina puts the bowl in the sink, heads for the door. \nGINA Just a moment, Biko. And you're going to be late -- She throws open the door... SMITH and JONES press in! Jones clamping a hand over her mouth. Watching them work is awe-inspiring, chilling. There's no wasted motion whatsoever. Their faces calm, observant. Jones holds Gina, gun covers the dark entrance to the bathroom where the shower still runs as Smith turns the music up LOUD, then opens the oven, blows out the pilot light, turns on the gas... CLOSE ON THE GAS -- A hazy layer, rippling over the floor... Smith grabs a candle off Gina's table, lights its wick, sets it on top of the stove. \nIN THE DARK BATHROOM PRESSED against the wall, trapped, fully aware of what's _ going on, Martin. He's pulled on clothes. By looking in the small mirror over the sink, he can see the men going about their work. He can see their weapons. His eyes SEARCH for anything useful, anything at all. There's nothing. He reaches towards the small window to the exterior. It swings open, revealing the FIRE ESCAPE beyond. \nIN THE APARTMENT The gas HISSES as it spills into the room. Smith grabs the bottle of alcohol, douses Gina as with one hand Jones produces a hypodermic... . A LOW THUMP from the bathroom. Smith REACTS instantly, KICKS in the bathroom door, gun lined... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: . on NOTHING. The empty shower runs. The window to the exterior swings gently. \nGINA Terror-stricken, realizing Martin has abandoned her. Jones nods to Smith who goes out the door, covers the hall. Jones FLIPS Gina onto her stomach, presses her face to the floor, pulling down the top of her pants as he prepares to inject her with the hypodermic. She struggles, SCREAMS IN RAGE, chokes on the gas. Her EYES WIDEN as Jones slides the needle in, starts to PRESS... . CRASH! Martin blasts in from the fire escape, through the window nearest them, catching Jones in the face, cutting his face. He tumbles over -- his gun sliding away... \nMARTIN AND JONES . Tumble together, SMASH into the sideboard which collapses, splintering into the kitchen. Martin tries to hit Jones who easily deflects the blow, leaps cat-like to his feet, moving towards his gun as Smith re- enters, weapon drawn, and FREEZES, his eyes tracking: THE CANDLE, teetering on the stove... now falling over... rolling... Jones, Smith, Martin... all track the candle, its progress towards the edge of the stove... Jones and Smith RUN towards the door.

Martin covering Gina. PRESSURE WAVE sweeps over them, burning debris raining. \nFRACTURED VISION... TINNITUS DAZE... Fires spreading, the main room beyond the bedroom an INFERNO. Martin pulls Gina up. They move to the window and the fire escape. Gina begins to slide it open... \nMARTIN No, look! She tracks his gaze: Down below, Jones exits the building, looks up amidst other onlookers. Wipes blood from his face. Martin looks around, wild, for anything, his gaze settling on: the far wall. Flames FLARE in, growing. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) With a ROAR Martin rushes the wall, IMPACTS it with his shoulder, goes right through! \nINT.

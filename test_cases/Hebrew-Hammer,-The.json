{"test1_input": "He approaches FOREGROUND, and pulls out something from his jacket pocket. \nWe see a CU of the same matchbook the elf gave him. \"DUKE'S - WHERE SKIN IS IN.\" \nHe lights a match and tosses it over his shoulder. We hear the sounds of bursting flames. \nThe Hammer puts his sunglasses on, and walks straight past the camera. \nWe pull back into a SPINNING OVERHEAD to reveal flames in the shape of the STAR OF DAVID burning on the lawn. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nPUSHERMAN MONTAGE \nCurtis Mayfield's 'Pusherman' FADES UP, and we cut into a STILL PHOTO of Tiny Tim with his arms around two Hasidic boys in an a alley. The SCREEN DIVIDES INTO THIRDS as we see CU's of each character smiling. Stills are constantly replaced in time with the music. We see a still of MONEY BEING EXCHANGED, then HANDS BEING SHAKEN. Then a still of a VIDEOCASSETTE BEING PLACED INTO A VCR, A HASIDIC KID WATCHING THE TV, etc. The music continues as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEWISH HOME - DAY \nMaccabee, the same kid the Hammer gave the Hanukkah present to earlier in the film, sits glued to his television set. O.S. from the television we hear someone approximating Zuzu from the film 'It's A Wonderful Life' say... \nTELEVISION SET Papa, Papa! Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing an angel gets his wings! \nA JEWISH MOTHER calls to her son from O.S. \nJEWISH MOTHER (O.S.) Maccabee! It's time to light the menorah! \nMaccabee looks over his shoulder in disgust, and then CRANKS UP THE VOLUME on the film until all other sounds are drowned out. \nCUT BACK TO: \nPUSHERMAN MONTAGE \nMore STILLS depicting the sale and distribution of the videocassettes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANOTHER JEWISH HOME - NIGHT \nA second ADDICT JEWISH CHILD is glued to his TV set. Drool slowly makes its way down his chin. He gets up, and we FOLLOW him into the living room where we find his PARENTS. His father reads a newspaper, while his mother is absorbed in her knitting. \nADDICT JEWISH CHILD Mom, dad. How come you made me Jewish? \nHis parents look to one another in absolute shock. \nCUT BACK TO: \nMORE PUSHERMAN MONTAGE \nMore STILLS... \nCUT TO: \nINT. YET ANOTHER JEWISH HOME - DAY \nAn ADOLESCENT HASIDIC BOY backs his way through the front door into the kitchen. He's carrying an incredibly large CHRISTMAS TREE. \nWe cut to a shot of HIS FAMILY, who watch this all go down as they sit at the kitchen table. \nThe Adolescent Hasid finally gets the tree into the house, and turns to see the rest of his family staring at him, mouths agape. \nADOLESCENT HASIDIC BOY What? It's a Hanukkah bush. \nThe family remains expressionless. \nThe glass in his mother's hand, slips from her grasp and shatters on the kitchen floor. \nEXT. JEWISH GHETTO STREET - DAY \n", "test1_true": "INT. HAMMER'S CADDY - CONTINUOUS \nThings definitely seem odd. The Hammer looks out his left window. TWO Hasidic CHILDREN decorate a giant Christmas tree on the street. \nHe looks to his right. A GROUP of HASIDIC kids sing Christmas Carols. \nThe Hammer looks through his front windshield. A kid is standing right in the middle of the road! \nThe Hammer slams on his breaks, skidding to a stop just inches from the kid. It's Shlomo (remember the kid the Hammer helped with the Yarmulke earlier?), and he has a strange glazed look in his eyes. Shlomo holds a videocassette in his hand. \nThe Hammer steps out of the Caddy, leaving his car door open. We hear the annoying beep, beep, beep door ajar sound. \nHAMMER Shlomo, you okay? \nSHLOMO (Dreamily) Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings! \nHAMMER Huh. \nThe car door beeps again. The kid looks to it, and the Hammer follows his gaze. \nSHLOMO Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings! \nThe Hammer is baffled. He looks down at Shlomo's hand and spots the videocassette. He grabs it from him and examines at it. \nHAMMER Bootleg 'It's A Wonderful Life' from Taiwan. \nThe Hammer inspects the tape a little longer, and then gives the label a huge lick. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Sixty five percent pure. Damn! People could get hurt watching this shit. (To Shlomo) Come with me. \nA POV shot from inside the Hammer's trunk as it opens. Hammer stands with Shlomo. \nInside the trunk we see a box of videos. The three on top read, \"Fiddler On The Roof,\" \"Yentl,\" and \"Chaim Potok's The Chosen.\" The Hammer grabs a copy of the Chosen and hands it to Shlomo. \nSHLOMO Chaim Potok's The Chosen? \nHAMMER Get yourself home and watch this as soon as possible. \nA HASIDIC KID ON A BIKE with a Christmas tree in tow rides past the two. One of the ornaments makes a tinkling sound. \nSHLOMO Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing, an angel gets his wings! \nThe Hammer slaps him out of his spell. \nHAMMER Hey, hey, hey! You can beat this. Now get going. \nEXT. JEWISH GHETTO STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Hammer dials a number on the payphone. As he dials, he verbalizes the number he's calling. \nHAMMER \nThe Hammer struggles with the last number, but then quickly remembers. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) \nIt rings once, and then we hear the other line pick up. \nINT. CHIEF'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nThe Chief's on the other end. \nINTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION \nHAMMER Chief, it's me. Listen carefully. I need for the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy to mass produce video copies of every Hollywood movie ever made featuring a positive Jewish protagonist as its lead. \nCHIEF You mean you want us to make copies of Yentl, Fiddler On The Roof, and Chaim Potok's The Chosen? \nHAMMER That'll work. Get them out to the Jewish community stat. We got an epidemic on our hands. \n", "test1_id": 1551, "test2_input": "She begins to walk away, but then catches herself as she turns back to face them. \nHARRIET TUBBELMAN (CONT'D) Oh yeah, and keep your arms and legs inside the water craft at all times. \nHAMMER Where are we? What is this place? \nShe smiles with great pride. \nHARRIET TUBBELMAN Welcome to the Underground Jewish Railroad. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. \nThe brakes on the water craft release, and the craft makes it way from the loading dock. \nWide eyed, Esther and Hammer check out their surroundings. \nHasidic Animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of Jewish oppression and persecution in an educational, yet oddly entertaining way. \nThe Hammer puts his arm around Esther and continues to check out the attraction in wonderment. \nEsther secretly glances at him affectionately. It's clear she's falling for him. \nWe cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down the river. A funkdafied version of the \"Let My People Go\" song FADES UP and over the gospel version from the ride. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nWe see a non-descript door in the middle of a brick wall. Two turnstiles stand directly in front of the door. We can hear the muffled sounds of the gospel version of \"Let My People Go.\" Scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase, \"HANUKKAH NOW!\" \nThe door opens, and the obnoxiously loud music spills out into the street. The Hammer and Esther exit, close the door, and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley. \nHAMMER That got annoying fairly quickly. \nESTHER Yeah, no kidding. \nA CARNIVAL WORKER stands behind a makeshift 'Underground Jewish Railroad' booth. \nCARNIVAL WORKER Tickets please. \nThe two hand the Carnival Worker their tickets. \nCARNIVAL WORKER (CONT'D) Thanks for riding the Underground Jewish Railroad. If you plan on returning today, please make sure to get you hands stamped before you leave the alley. \nHAMMER Nah, we're kosher. Thanks though. \nThe two walk past him. Esther turns to the Hammer. \nESTHER So, now what? \nHAMMER Now we wait for Santa to make his next move. \nHe gives her a once over. She is stunning. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Want to get a drink? \nESTHER Sure. Why not. \nEXT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - DAY \nYour typical Blaxploitation bar. It could easily pass for the Lenox Lounge in Harlem, with the exception of the large menorah shaped sign out front. \nINT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - CONTINUOUS \nWe see a bar packed with ORTHODOX JEWS. A WALL separating the men and women in the bar runs along the center of the room, stopping about ten feet from the stage. Signs clearly demarcate these 'MEN' and 'WOMEN' sections. \nOnstage, a KLEZMER band plays a rendition of a to be determined 70's funk classic. \nEsther and the Hammer enter the joint. Mid song, the BANDLEADER notices the two walk in... \nBANDLEADER Hey! The Hebrew Hammer everybody! \nThe Hammer raises his hand in acknowledgment. The entire bar cheers and applauds. \n", "test2_true": "The band begins a rousing version of \"Hava Nagila.\" A good majority of the men in the bar rush to the dance floor and begin dancing zealously with one another. \nEsther shouts over the wall in an attempt to overcome the din of the bar. \nESTHER So, do you come here often!? \nThe Hammer struggles to hear. He shouts back to her. \nHAMMER What was that!? \nESTHER I said, do you come here often!? \nHAMMER Oh. Yeah, about once a week! \nESTHER What!? \nHAMMER I said, yeah, about once a week! \nESTHER Oh! \nA HASIDIC BAR PATRON approaches the Hammer and smiles. \nHASIDIC BAR PATRON Would you like to dance? \nWe get another shot of the men dancing together, arm in arm, on the dance floor. \nHAMMER I'm okay right now. Thanks though. \nAs the Patron leaves, JOSHUA, another Hasidic man standing directly behind him takes his place at the Hammer's table. \nJOSHUA Hey Morty, wanna cut a rug? \nHAMMER Nah, I'm good. I'm kind of here with somebody. \nThe Hammer motions to the wall. Joshua looks as if his feelings are hurt. \nJOSHUA Oh. Okay. Maybe next time. \nHAMMER Yeah. Maybe next time Joshua. Take it easy. \nAs Joshua leaves, we get a WIDER shot of the Hammer's table. A LONG LINE OF MEN leads up to it. \nCHAIM FEYGELE, an effeminate slick Hasidic man, chest hair spilling out of his loosely buttoned butterfly collar shirt, neck dripping with gold chains, steps up to the Hammer. He's got a huge phoney smile plastered across his face. \nCHAIM FEYGELE Well Shalom there mister! \nHAMMER Do we know each other? \nCHAIM FEYGELE No, but we have mutual friends. \nChaim points to the dance floor. Another shot of men dancing with one another, arm in arm. \nCHAIM FEYGELE (CONT'D) The name's Feygele. Chaim Feygele. \nThis guy is clearly making the Hammer nervous. \nHAMMER Mordechai. My friends call me Morty. \nCHAIM FEYGELE So Morty, I just love a man in a black suit. Care to dance. \nMordechai is flustered. \nHAMMER Uhhh. You know, I...have to go to the bathroom. I'll be right back. \nThe Hammer gets up quickly and leaves. \nWe cut to Esther's side of the wall. The Hammer walks behind her while she checks out the band on stage. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Hey there. \n", "test2_id": 1552, "test3_input": "He takes off down the hall after Santa. \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER CORRIDOR \nMo catches up to the hobbling Tiny Tim, and begins to mock the manner and speed at which he runs, running side by side with him, circling around him as he attempts to get away, etc. \nRealizing that it'd be impossible to outrun him, Tiny Tim comes to a stop. \nMo trains his pistol on him. \nMOHAMMED Now I'm gonna do to you what I should have done earlier. \nTiny Tim closes his eyes in anticipation of the worst. \nMo grabs both of his crutches from under his arm and runs off. Tiny Tim wobbles a few steps and then slumps down against the wall. We PULL AWAY from Tiny Tim as he calls to Mo. \nTINY TIM My crutches. Noooo. Not my crutches. \nINT. SANTA'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSanta enters the room and begins to frantically barricade the front door with anything he can find: a chair, a large crucifix, a CART OF TOMATOES. Feeling confident that the door is secure, he turns around to find the Hammer standing in front of him. \nThe Hammer grabs Santa by his shirt. \nHAMMER Where's my girlfriend Santa? \nSANTA I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you! \nThe Hammer's confused. \nHAMMER But if I kill you, then you'll be dead. \nSanta thinks about this for a couple seconds. \nSANTA Good point. \nThe Hammer looks up from his interrogation and spots a sign taped to a door directly behind Santa. It reads, \"THE ROOM WHERE THE HEBREW HAMMER'S GIRLFRIEND IS.\" \nThe Hammer grins mischievously at Santa. \nHAMMER Don't worry your pretty little head. \nHammer fires a single round past camera. RED SPLATTERS his face. \nWe cut to the other side. Santa cowers by the cart of TOMATOES. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) That was a warning shot. \nWe hear Esther screaming from inside the room. \nESTHER (O.S.) Mordechai! I'm in here! Help! \nThe Hammer turns towards the sound. \nSuddenly, Santa kicks the Hammer's gun out of his hand, and then draws a pistol from behind his belt and points it at him. \nSANTA Looks like the tables have turned once again Hammer. \nMore screaming from Esther behind the door. \nSANTA (CONT'D) And you won't even be able to say goodbye to your Esther. So sad. So long Mordechai. Give my father my regards. \nSanta readies to fire. \nHAMMER Wait! I didn't want it to come to this, but you leave me no choice. I have no other option but to use the most powerful weapon in the Jewish arsenal. \nThe Hammer closes his eyes and puts his hands together as if in meditation. Santa looks around nervously. \n", "test3_true": "The Hammer meditates for a bit more. Suddenly, his eyes open and he begins... \nHAMMER I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you? \nSANTA Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it. \nEsther continues to scream for help. This makes the Hammer even more determined. \nHAMMER What sort of host would treat company this way? Esther is clearly uncomfortable in your guest room. I'm shvitizing from running around shooting people. And my feet. What kind of flooring is this anyway? My arches are killing me. \nIt's beginning to work on Santa. \nSANTA No. Stop it! \nHAMMER And to top it off, you didn't even have the courtesy to give me a proper hello when I entered the room. What have I ever done to you to be treated with such disrespect? \nSanta's a wreck. \nSANTA Please, make it stop. I'll do anything. Here take my gun. \nHe hands his piece to the Hammer and kneels on the ground, pointing to his head. \nSANTA (CONT'D) Shoot me. Please, just one to the head. Put me out of misery. \nMo enters the room. \nMOHAMMED Hammer, you alright? \nHAMMER Everything's kosher. Watch him for me. \nINT. ROOM WHERE THE HEBREW HAMMER'S GIRLFRIEND IS - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Hammer kicks open the door. \nHAMMER Esther! \nESTHER Mordechai! \nShe is restrained to a chair. The Hammer quickly unties her, and the two kiss. \nAs they continue kissing, we hear the sound of someone CLEARING THEIR THROAT. The Hammer looks towards the source of the noise to see none other than JOSEPH LIEBERMAN. Joe is tied to a chair, and wears a Gore/Lieberman 2000 campaign button. \nHAMMER Joseph Lieberman? \nThe Hammer begins to untie Joe. \nJOSEPH LIEBERMAN Mordechai! Thank god you're here. \nEsther looks at the Hammer curiously. \nESTHER You two know each other? \nHAMMER We go to the same temple. \nAll three step back into Santa's Conference Room. Mo continues to hold Santa at gunpoint. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Mo, get him out of my sight. \nMo begins to take Santa away. \nThe Hammer turns around. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) No, wait. I need closure here. (To Santa) I just wanna say one thing. You know where you messed up Santa? You underestimated the true meaning of Hanukkah. \nSanta's a broken man. He gets on his knees and inquires earnestly... \nSANTA Please tell me. What is the true meaning of Hanukkah? \nThe Hammer thinks about this for a second. He's drawing a blank. He looks to Esther, and she shrugs back at him. \n", "test3_id": 1553}

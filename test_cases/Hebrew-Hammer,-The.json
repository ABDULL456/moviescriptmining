{"train": "THE HEBREW HAMMER \nWritten by \nJonathan Kesselman \nOver BLACK, we hear the first few bars of Jingle Bells. The music morphs into an OMINOUS SCORE. \nWith a thunderous BOOM, comes a TITLE CARD reading \"HANUKKAH PAST.\" \nEXT. PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL - DAY \nWe start on JESUS ON A CRUCIFIX, and then violently CRANE down to reveal MORDECHAI (10), a timid little Hasidic boy standing nervously at the foot of the statue. \nBehind Morty is a wall with the graffiti phrase \"HANUKKAH IS 4 HOMOS\" scrawled across it. He clutches his Sandy Koufax lunchbox tightly as he looks off into the distance. He's got quite a large bulge in his pants for a child his age. \nWe see a menacing, EXTREMELY WIDE ANGLE shot of the school. Superimposed over the picture are the words, \"ST. PETER, PAUL, AND MARY PUBLIC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL.\" \nMordechai takes a deep breath, and walks towards the school. \nEXT. SCHOOLYARD - MOMENTS LATER \nMordechai walks past a row of bleachers occupied by FOUR GENTILE CHILDREN. \nGENTILE BOY 1 Hey Mordechai, look. I dropped a penny. \nHe drops a penny. The other children cackle. \nThe Gentile Girl next to him holds up a bag of bagels. \nGENTILE GIRL 1 Hey Mordechai. Want a bagel? \nGentile Boy 1 feigns choking. \nGENTILE BOY 2 Hey Jew nose, save some oxygen for us. \nMore laughter. Morty attempts to take it all in stride. We PUSH into GENTILE GIRL 2, a severe looking puritanically dressed child as she turns to face the camera. \nGENTILE GIRL 2 Hey Morty, my mom says that unless your people wise up and accept Jesus Christ as your lord and savior you're all going to burn in hell. \nDead silence. The other children exchange \"Now that went a little over the line\" looks. \nThe silence is broken by the sound of the SCHOOLBELL. Morty gathers himself, and walks off. \nINT. CLASSROOM - LATER \nAs Morty holds a small gift wrapped box in his hands we hear a tinny version of the song Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel. \nHe tears open the wrapping paper to reveal a DREIDEL. He looks at his gift, and then looks off-screen. We PAN with his look to reveal... \nA group of Christian children congregating around a large, garishly decorated Christmas tree. A very Vegas Merry Christmas sign flashes as a larger-than-life HI-FI version of the Christmas song Jingle Bells blares. The children festively slap high fives as they open their presents. \nWe cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Boy 1 enamored with his brand new ATC motorbike. \nWe cut to a SLOW-MOTION CU of Gentile Girl 1. She wears an \"I Love Jesus\" T-shirt and holds an adorable dog with a bow affixed to its head in her arms. It licks her on the face. \nWe cut back to Mordechai. He looks down at his pathetic excuse for a present. He's on the verge of tears. \nGentile Boy 1 calls to Mordechai as he drives his ATC. \nGENTILE BOY 1 Hey everybody! Look what Mordechai got. Nice spinning top Morty. \nThe other children take notice of Mordechai's gift and begin to laugh. \nMordechai is crushed. MRS. HIGHSMITH (40's), an incredibly Waspy teacher puts down her copy of 'Modern W.A.S.P.,' and appears genuinely concerned by the teasing Mordechai has weathered. She walks over to comfort him. \nMRS. HIGHSMITH Now, now class let's not make fun of Mordechai's spinning top. We need to all learn the importance of tolerance and understanding. Isn't that right Mordechai? \nMORDECHAI Yes Mrs. Highsmith. \nADL CHAIRMAN Only problem is, ever since we kicked him out, he wants nothing to do with us. There's no way we can persuade him to come back. \nEsther lifts her skirt a few inches. \nESTHER Perhaps I can persuade him. \nSTAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: \nINT. HEBREW HAMMER INVESTIGATIONS - PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY \nA shoddy low-rent office replete with Film Noirish lighting via the blinds. The Hammer fiddles with a dreidel as he sits with his feet propped up on his desk. His Shtreml hat is skewed to one side and a toothpick dangles from his lips. \nHAMMER (V.O.) It was the day before Hanukkah when she strolled into my office. \nThere is knock at the door. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Come in. \nThe door opens to reveal a long denim skirt covering every possible inch of flesh. We tilt up the length of the skirt to reveal Esther. She is breathtakingly sexy. \nThe Hammer quickly removes his feet from the table. Esther approaches his desk and sits. \nESTHER Mr. Jefferson Carver? \nHAMMER Please, call me Mordechai. \nHAMMER (V.O.) (CONT'D) From the way she carried herself I could tell she'd been around the block a few times... \nESTHER Sorry I'm late. Traffic was a pisher, and I've been circling the block for the past half hour looking for parking. What are you listening to? \nHAMMER (V.O.) Oh, the things I would do to her if I had the... \nThe Hammer attempts to press stop on his tape recorder, but accidentally FAST FORWARDS to another part of the tape. We hear the sound of SEXUAL INTERCOURSE. The Hammer scrambles for the STOP button. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Client notes. Sorry. (Beat) What can I do for you? \nESTHER My name is Esther. Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal from the Jewish Defense League desperately needs to speak with you. \nHAMMER How is old Chief Bloomenbergensteinenthal? Is he still shtooping every girl he can get his hands on? \nESTHER (Annoyed) Actually, his days of marital infidelity have long since past. Now he just shtoops my mother exclusively. \nThe Hammer makes the realization. \nHAMMER Your mother? Oh. Whoops. \nESTHER Mordechai, Santa Claus has been rubbed out by his son Damian. The man's a demon. There's no telling what this new anti semitic psycho Santa is capable of. \nHAMMER I'm sorry to hear about Santa. He was a good friend, but my days... \nThe Hammer stops himself and glances over Esther's shoulder. \nIn the doorway stands a BLONDE BOMBSHELL in a mink coat. \nBLONDE BOMBSHELL Mr. Hammer? I'd like to hire you to put a tail on my husband. I think my life might be in danger. I think he wants to kill me. \nHAMMER Sorry Shiksa, I think you got the wrong office. I'm the Hebrew Hammer. Mike Hammer's down the hall. \nThe Blonde Bombshell is confused for a moment. \nBLONDE BOMBSHELL Oh. \nShe leaves. \nHAMMER Listen. Esther, you seem like a nice girl, so I'm only gonna say this once. I no longer affiliate myself with that organization. The politics there were brutal. Besides, I've already got a full case load. \nEsther looks down at his desk. \nWe cut to a shot of the Hammer's In/Out Box. Both are completely empty, and thickly coated with spiderwebs. \nMRS. CARVER (Hysterically) Nonsense young man. You'll eat everything in front of you. After all, there are people starving in China. Isn't that right Mun Chi? \nWe cut to a previously unseen end of the table. MUN CHI, a skin and bones elderly Chinese man looks up in response to his name. The plate directly in front of him is still pristine. He mutters something in Chinese and then reaches for a chicken wing on a platter in the middle of the table. \nMrs. Carver smacks his hands away with a wooden salad spoon and then glares at him. \nMRS. CARVER (CONT'D) Not until Mordechai finishes everything in front of him. \nMrs. Carver directs her piercing stare at the Hammer. \nMRS. CARVER (CONT'D) Mordechai!? (Beat) So, Esther, how did you and Mordechai meet. You know they call him the Hebrew Hammer for a reason. \nEsther coughs up some of her food. The Hammer interjects. \nHAMMER Mom! Esther works for the JDL. They sent her to try and recruit me back to save Hanukkah for them. What she doesn't seem to understand is that nothing, not even god himself could convince me to ever work for them again. \nESTHER But Hanukkah's in dan... \nThe Hammer cuts her off. \nHAMMER Not my problem. If you'll excuse me now, I need to use the bathroom. \nHe stands and leaves. \nMrs. Carver stares lovingly at Esther. \nMRS. CARVER You like my Mordechai, yes? \nESTHER He's...he's very nice. (Desperately) But Mrs. Carver, the fate of Hanukkah rests solely in his hands. Please, you have to help me. \nMRS. CARVER Hanukkah, Shmanukkah. It isn't even one of the high holidays. What concerns me more is that my boychick is almost thirty, and has yet to settle down with a nice Jewish girl. (Beat) I'll make you a deal. I'll help you with your little Hanukkah problem if you help me with my Mordechai. \nESTHER (Confused) What do you want me to do? \nMRS. CARVER He works too much. God forbid he should have a nice Jewish girl come eat by him once in a while. Take his mind off his work. Maybe a blowjob here and there. \nEsther begins to choke again. \nMRS. CARVER (CONT'D) Is this something you could do for me? \nThe Hammer calls out from the bathroom. \nHAMMER Mom, where do you keep the plunger? \nMRS. CARVER (Yells) It's under the sink by my tampons! \nEsther appears panicked. \nMRS. CARVER (CONT'D) So, do we have a deal? \nIn the BG, we hear the toilet FLUSH. The Hammer begins his walk back to the table. \nESTHER Deal. \nThe Hammer sits down. \nHAMMER So, what did you two ladies discuss while I was gone. \nEsther begins to speak, but Mrs. Carver interrupts. \nMRS. CARVER I was just telling your nice friend Esther about how I used to have such a problem with the gas. (To Esther) So, once I started taking two charcoal pills before I ate, the gas cleared itself right up. \nEsther plays along. \nESTHER Thanks. That's...good to know. \nMrs. Carver turns her attention towards her son. \nMRS. CARVER Mordechai. Do you love your mother? \nHAMMER Mordechai Baruch Netanyahoo. \nThe vault-like gate slides open in a futuristic manner, and the Hammer steps in. The gate shuts behind him, and he finds himself in an all white room. A microphone is placed by another massive door directly in front of him. \nCOMPUTERIZED VOICE Please state the six dishes found on the Passover Seder plate in alphabetical order? \nHAMMER Beitzah, Charoset, Chazeret, Karpas, Maror, and Zeroa. \nThe second door slides open, and Morty steps forward into the next room. Inside this room lies a single violin in a case. \nCOMPUTERIZED VOICE Please demonstrate musical aptitude. \nThe Hammer picks up the violin and begins to play 'Hava Nagila.' He's pretty damn good at it. The next door slides open, and Hammer steps forward into yet another room. \nA drape, about four feet high off the floor, is stretched into a semi-circle against the wall of the room. \nCOMPUTERIZED VOICE (CONT'D) Please step forward and remove your undergarments. \nThe Hammer steps inside the drape, and drops his pants. \nA panel on the wall opens, and a metal probe heads for his shmekel. He is clearly uncomfortable with this bit of testing. \nHAMMER Oooh. That's cold. \nCOMPUTERIZED VOICE Circumcision confirmed. \nThe door slides open, and the Hammer quickly pulls his pants up as he steps into the next room. The room is completely empty with the exception of a one way mirror on the front wall by the door. \nCOMPUTERIZED VOICE (CONT'D) Final test initiated. \nNothing happens. The Hammer waits a few seconds, but quickly becomes agitated. \nHAMMER Hello? Can anybody hear me? I think this machine is broken or something. Hello? (To himself) This is ridiculous! I didn't even want to come here. I shlep all the way out to the middle of nowhere, for lord knows what purpose, and... \nWe cut to the OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR. The Chief observes the Hammer as he continues to whine. Next to them, a METER with the label \"WHINING SCALE\" slowly grows in magnitude as the Hammer continues to rant. The meter bars go from red to yellow in color. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) I am so unhappy with this situation. Why Mordechai? Why do you always feel it necessary to do what other people want you to do? Why can't you be your own man... \nCHIEF Come on. Come on. \nThe meter bars switch from yellow to green, finally passing the '0  - Jewish' mark. \nCHIEF (CONT'D) (To himself) He's still got it. \nBack inside with the Hammer, the doors slide open, revealing the Chief to the Hammer. \nCHIEF (CONT'D) Welcome back Hammer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Hammer and the Chief make their way down the hallway. \nCHIEF Since you've been gone Hammer, some things have changed around here. Our agents are now subjected to a strict physical training regiment. Take a look. \nThe Chief stops at a door labeled \"Goldsmith's Gym.\" The sign is illustrated with a picture of a Hasidic Jew squatting a dumbbell a la Gold's Gym. The Chief opens the door. \nINT. KARATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nInside, about FIVE or so HASIDS decked out in white Karate gi's stand facing the door. By the front door, A GROUP LEADER, notices the Hammer, and walks towards the door. He bows with his hands folded in front of him as a sign of respect. \nThe Hammer returns the gesture. \nThe Group Leader shakes his head in one last respect, and then turns away from the Hammer as he goes back to his class. On the back of his gi is written the word \"JEW-DO.\" \nHAMMER A minion practicing Jew-do, the deadly fighting art. Cool. \nCHIEF There's more. Follow me. \nBLACK TEENAGER Oh shit! \nThe teen runs inside. \nThe Hammer's Caddy pulls up to a stop right at camera, giving us a full view of the license plate. It reads, \"LCHAIM.\" \nINT. KWANZAA LIBERATION FRONT HQ - MOMENTS LATER \nA handful of BAAAD BROTHERS, decked out in a mixture of African clothing and combat gear relax to the sounds of mellow Blaxploitation music. 'KWANZAA NOW!' posters and other Pro-Kwanzaa propaganda hang on the walls of the room, machine guns rest idly against sofas,  blunts are passed around. We're talking Black Panthers here. A WHITE ACCOUNTANT counts money at a card table to the side of the room. \nThe black teenager enters breathlessly. \nBLACK TEENAGER Hey, yo, we got ourselves a visitor. \nO.S., one of the BAAAD BROTHERS inquires. \nBAAAD BROTHER (O.S.) Who is it? \nBLACK TEENAGER It's some pimped out Hebrew dude in a caddy. \nThe men scramble for their guns, inserting clips, and removing safeties. \nThe front doors bust open, and we DOLLY into the Hammer. \nAll guns are trained on him. \nFrom behind the frontline of gunmen, MOHAMMED, clearly the leader of the operation, pushes his way through. \nHe walks towards the Hammer. You can feel the tension in the room. \nMOHAMMED The Hebrew Hammer! My main Kike! \nHAMMER Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim. My main nigga! \nThe two embrace in a warm hug. The White Accountant looks up in shock from the card table. His nametag is clearly visible, and it reads, \"WHITE ACCOUNTANT.\" He points at Mohammed. \nWHITE ACCOUNTANT You...you just called him a Kike. \nHe points to the Hammer. \nWHITE ACCOUNTANT (CONT'D) And you. You just called him a Nigger. \nThe Hammer and Mohammed look to one another. They're having a hard time understanding his concern. \nMOHAMMED Well it's okay when we call each other that. \nThe White Accountant thinks it over for a second. \nWHITE ACCOUNTANT Oh. \nThe other Brothers put their guns down and go back to their pre-Hammer activities, and the accountant takes his place back at the card table. \nMohammed puts his arm around the Hammer. \nMOHAMMED So Morde-chai, tell me, what brings your bad self down to the KLF? \nHAMMER I'm back on the job for the JDL. You hear about that crazy white boy who took over as Santa? \nMOHAMMED Oh, most definitely. Got the brothers here in full alert mode. \nThe Hammer looks over at the Brothers smoking weed, making out with their girlfriends, etc. Mohammed takes notice. \nMOHAMMED (CONT'D) Gotta always be cool under pressure. You know what I'm sayin. \nHAMMER True dat. True dat. So, what's the word on the street? \nMOHAMMED Word is that papa's got a brand new bag, and it's velvety red, and it ain't gonna be overnight Fed-Exed to Jerusalem. If you know what I mean. \nThis clearly flies over the Hammer's yarmulke. \nSANTA (CONT'D) With the Hebrew Hammer out of the picture, Hanukkah will be nothing more than a confusing and hard to pronounce word. I want to thank you very much Jamal for all of your help. \nWe cut to the other side to reveal whom he's speaking to. Jamal, the same black 'elf' from the Kwanzaa Liberation Front sits at the table across from Santa. \nJAMAL Pfff. Shit nigga, ain't no thang. Hey, yo Santy Claus, so does this mean that you gonna make me an official elf now? \nSANTA Can you believe this guy Tiny Tim? \nSanta looks over to TINY TIM. Unshaven, not so tiny anymore, and still on crutches, Tiny Tim's grown up since 'A Christmas Carol.' A common street thug. C'mon, did you seriously think that Scrooge would give free handouts to the Cratchit family forever? \nTiny Tim shrugs his shoulders. \nSANTA (CONT'D) Take a look around you Jamal. Do you see any colored midgets in my workshop? \nA shot of a couple of the same elves from the conference room slaving away on the assembly line. \nSANTA (CONT'D) Your presence would be a disruption to the utopian model of efficiency I've created here. \nJAMAL That's some cold shit. \nThe ELVES appear to be struggling with the speed at which the products move down the assembly line. The HEAD ELF steps out from the assembly line and addresses Santa. \nHEAD ELF Utopian model of efficiency my ass! Ever since you took charge, this place has been more like a sweatshop. \nThe other elves stop working and vocalize their agreement with the Head Elf. \nHEAD ELF (CONT'D) We know our rights Santa! You're in violation of the union regulations! We're going on strike! \nThe other elves shout out their approval. Santa takes it all in stride. \nSANTA You know something, you're right. \nThe Head Elf is taken aback by what seems to be a glimpse of compassion on Santa's part. \nHEAD ELF Really? \nSANTA Yeah. This is a sweatshop. And since you elves aren't willing to do the work, I made arrangements to have some Taiwanese children shipped over. And I might add, they're more than willing to work for peanuts. \nSanta performs the two fingered whistle. \nSANTA (CONT'D) Come on in boys! \nA group of FIVE TAIWANESE BOYS file past Santa towards the assembly line. \nAs each child passes Santa, he hands them each a bag of PEANUTS. \nAt the assembly line, the Taiwanese boys move like lightning as they gift wrap boxes clearly labeled \"NIKEY,\" \"KATHY LEE CLOTHING COMPANY,\" and \"STARSTRUCKS COFFEE.\" \nThe elves, including Jamal, watch in amazement at their agility and efficiency. \nDefeated, they shuffle out of the workshop. \nTINY TIM So, what's our first plan of attack Santa? \nSANTA While I was in Taiwan negotiating the solution to our labor problems, I came across a factory that illegally manufactures the most addictive, Jewish pride weakening substance on the planet. I bought the entire plant. \nSanta walks over to a FED-Y truck overflowing with large brown cardboard boxes marked 'PRODUCT.' \nSANTA (CONT'D) I want you and your men to target every young person in the Jewish neighborhoods of every major city of this country. I want you to flood their streets with this product. \nTINY TIM What should I charge? \nSANTA Oh, that's the beauty of it. These are free samples. \nTiny Tim's curiosity is peaked. \nTINY TIM So what's in the boxes? Heroin? Cocaine? \nSANTA Worse. \nHe approaches FOREGROUND, and pulls out something from his jacket pocket. \nWe see a CU of the same matchbook the elf gave him. \"DUKE'S - WHERE SKIN IS IN.\" \nHe lights a match and tosses it over his shoulder. We hear the sounds of bursting flames. \nThe Hammer puts his sunglasses on, and walks straight past the camera. \nWe pull back into a SPINNING OVERHEAD to reveal flames in the shape of the STAR OF DAVID burning on the lawn. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nPUSHERMAN MONTAGE \nCurtis Mayfield's 'Pusherman' FADES UP, and we cut into a STILL PHOTO of Tiny Tim with his arms around two Hasidic boys in an a alley. The SCREEN DIVIDES INTO THIRDS as we see CU's of each character smiling. Stills are constantly replaced in time with the music. We see a still of MONEY BEING EXCHANGED, then HANDS BEING SHAKEN. Then a still of a VIDEOCASSETTE BEING PLACED INTO A VCR, A HASIDIC KID WATCHING THE TV, etc. The music continues as we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEWISH HOME - DAY \nMaccabee, the same kid the Hammer gave the Hanukkah present to earlier in the film, sits glued to his television set. O.S. from the television we hear someone approximating Zuzu from the film 'It's A Wonderful Life' say... \nTELEVISION SET Papa, Papa! Mommy says that every time you hear the sound of a bell ringing an angel gets his wings! \nA JEWISH MOTHER calls to her son from O.S. \nJEWISH MOTHER (O.S.) Maccabee! It's time to light the menorah! \nMaccabee looks over his shoulder in disgust, and then CRANKS UP THE VOLUME on the film until all other sounds are drowned out. \nCUT BACK TO: \nPUSHERMAN MONTAGE \nMore STILLS depicting the sale and distribution of the videocassettes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ANOTHER JEWISH HOME - NIGHT \nA second ADDICT JEWISH CHILD is glued to his TV set. Drool slowly makes its way down his chin. He gets up, and we FOLLOW him into the living room where we find his PARENTS. His father reads a newspaper, while his mother is absorbed in her knitting. \nADDICT JEWISH CHILD Mom, dad. How come you made me Jewish? \nHis parents look to one another in absolute shock. \nCUT BACK TO: \nMORE PUSHERMAN MONTAGE \nMore STILLS... \nCUT TO: \nINT. YET ANOTHER JEWISH HOME - DAY \nAn ADOLESCENT HASIDIC BOY backs his way through the front door into the kitchen. He's carrying an incredibly large CHRISTMAS TREE. \nWe cut to a shot of HIS FAMILY, who watch this all go down as they sit at the kitchen table. \nThe Adolescent Hasid finally gets the tree into the house, and turns to see the rest of his family staring at him, mouths agape. \nADOLESCENT HASIDIC BOY What? It's a Hanukkah bush. \nThe family remains expressionless. \nThe glass in his mother's hand, slips from her grasp and shatters on the kitchen floor. \nEXT. JEWISH GHETTO STREET - DAY \nCHIEF We're on it Hammer. How'd you do with Santa? \nHAMMER It was a trap. I'm back at square one. \nCHIEF Well, then I've got good news for you. We just got word that he'll be making an appearance at the Mall Of America today. I'm sending Esther to meet you there at once. \nHAMMER Good thinking. We'll disguise ourselves as a Gentile couple to pass undetected. Now that he thinks I'm dead, this should be a piece of homentashen. \nCHIEF One last thing Hammer. You take care of yourself. The... \nWe cut back to the Hammer on the payphone. He holds the receiver away from his ear. He doesn't want to hear this. \nHAMMER The fate of Hanukkah. Right. Right. Yeah, Got it. Will do. Okay, bye now. \nHe hangs up and leaves. \nSTAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: \nINT. MALL OF AMERICA - DAY \n'Merry Christmas' decorations and signage dominate the landscape of the establishing shot of the Mall. \nTiny Tim, walkie-talkie in hand, surveys this Christmas Wonderland with smug satisfaction. He spots a small, barely visible Hanukkah decoration poking out from beneath one of the other Christmas decorations. \nHe rips it from the wall and tosses it into a small trashcan bonfire. \nTiny Tim speaks into his the walkie-talkie. \nTINY TIM One partridge in a pear tree to two turtle doves. What's your status? \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER PART OF THE MALL \nTwo adult sized Santa's Helpers, TONY AND MIKEY stand with walkie-talkies behind the nightclub velvet ropes, and hold back the throngs (15-20 extras) of screaming children attempting to make their way past the red curtain to see Santa. A huge 'Citizen Kane'/Big Brother style poster with a menacing picture of Santa looms behind them. It reads, \"SANTA CLAUS: HE KNOWS IF YOU'VE BEEN NAUGHTY OR NICE.\" \nSanta's staging area is very Studio 54. Both Tony and Mikey are decked out in Addidas warm up pants, gold chains, etc. Tony, very Guido in his mannerisms, replies into his walkie... \nTONY Nothing stirring here. \nA little BLONDE GENTILE GIRL tugs on Tony's sleeve. \nBLONDE GENTILE GIRL Can I be next? Please, please! \nTONY Let's get a look at you, shall we. \nThe Gentile Girl pulls her Power Muff Girls T-shirt down, allowing the two to get a better look at it. \nTONY (CONT'D) A power muff girls T. Very nice. Alright, now spin around. \nShe twirls for the two. \nTONY (CONT'D) Very nice! Alright. You're cool. Go on and see Santa, sunshine. \nA pushy, FRECKLE FACED GENTILE BOY steps out of line and approaches the two. \nFRECKLE FACED GENTILE BOY That's not fair! How come she gets to go next? We were here first! \nTONY Oh really! Is that a fact? Well guess what buddy? You ain't gettin' in to see Santa today, so why don't you just turn around and high tail it home. \nThe kid begins to sob uncontrollably. \nFRECKLE FACED GENTILE BOY But I've been waiting to see Santa all year. \nTony apes him. \nTONY But I've been waiting to see Santa all year. \nThe kid is a pathetic mess. \nINSIDE THE CURTAIN \nJIMMY, an adorable six year old sits on Santa's lap. Santa's assistants, two busty blondes named BAMBI and TAWNI, flank his chair. \nSANTA And what do the Jewish people do during Hanukkah? \nJIMMY They worship the devil and sacrifice small Gentile children like me in bizarre, sadistic rituals. \nSANTA That's right. Santa can tell that you've been a very good boy this year. Run along now Jimmy. \nBambi and Tawni escort Jimmy out, and re-enter with Esther and the Hammer. Santa's confused. \nSANTA (CONT'D) Sorry folks, I don't do couples. \nHAMMER If you keep your mouth shut and come with me, you won't get hurt. \nSANTA Excuse me? Do I know you, friend? Take a look around you. Do you even know who I am? \nThe Hammer rips off his baseball hat and T-shirt. Santa gasps. \nHAMMER Let me guess, you're the goy who stole Hanukkah. \nSANTA The Hebrew Hammer! You're alive. \nThe Hammer takes out his gun and points it Santa. \nHAMMER What's your shpiel, Santa? \nSANTA Whoa, whoa there. C'mon Mordechai, is this any way to treat an old family friend? Let's cut out all the unpleasantness. I admit, I went way overboard with the whole Hanukkah thing. Let me make it up to you. How about a peace offering? (To Bambi and Tawni) Girls. \nSanta snaps his fingers, and Bambi and Tawni drape themselves on either side of the Hammer, rubbing his arms erotically. \nSANTA (CONT'D) Bambi. Tawni. I'd like for you to meet world renown Semitic super stud, Mordechai Jefferson Carver. \nBambi speaks with a thick Southern drawl. \nBAMBI Oh, I declare I just love Jewish men. They're so sensitive and well read. \nEsther is clearly jealous. \nThe Hammer's enjoying the attention. He looks down at Bambi's breasts. We're talking HUGE, obviously augmented boobolas. A large crucifix chain hangs around her neck, nestled in between the mounds of silicone. We hear the requisite DING as it sparkles. \nThe Hammer is released from the sexual spell of the Gentile Seductress. \nHAMMER Sorry Santa. I like my women like my matzah. Unleavened. \nThe girls move away from the Hammer. Esther smiles at the Hammer's resolve. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) This is where you go down. \nSuddenly, Tony draws the curtain back. \nTONY Hey, hurry it up in there. We gotta bunch of kids... \nHe sees the Hammer with his gun pointed at Santa's head. \nTONY (CONT'D) Oh shit! \nEsther pulls out her piece and points it at Tony. \nESTHER Back it up buddy! \nHe does. The entire crowd of children can now see what's happening. Hushed, fearful whispers. MC Hammer steps out of line and pleads... \nMC HAMMER Please Hammer, don't hurt em'! \nThe Hammer does a double take. MC Hammer gives a \"Did I just say that?\" expression. \nHAMMER Let's do this clean. I don't want to make a scene Santa. \nShe begins to walk away, but then catches herself as she turns back to face them. \nHARRIET TUBBELMAN (CONT'D) Oh yeah, and keep your arms and legs inside the water craft at all times. \nHAMMER Where are we? What is this place? \nShe smiles with great pride. \nHARRIET TUBBELMAN Welcome to the Underground Jewish Railroad. Just sit back, relax, and enjoy the ride. \nThe brakes on the water craft release, and the craft makes it way from the loading dock. \nWide eyed, Esther and Hammer check out their surroundings. \nHasidic Animatronic puppets sing of thousands of years of Jewish oppression and persecution in an educational, yet oddly entertaining way. \nThe Hammer puts his arm around Esther and continues to check out the attraction in wonderment. \nEsther secretly glances at him affectionately. It's clear she's falling for him. \nWe cut to a wide shot as we watch the craft disappear down the river. A funkdafied version of the \"Let My People Go\" song FADES UP and over the gospel version from the ride. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nWe see a non-descript door in the middle of a brick wall. Two turnstiles stand directly in front of the door. We can hear the muffled sounds of the gospel version of \"Let My People Go.\" Scribbled on the wall is the graffiti phrase, \"HANUKKAH NOW!\" \nThe door opens, and the obnoxiously loud music spills out into the street. The Hammer and Esther exit, close the door, and push their way past the turnstiles into the alley. \nHAMMER That got annoying fairly quickly. \nESTHER Yeah, no kidding. \nA CARNIVAL WORKER stands behind a makeshift 'Underground Jewish Railroad' booth. \nCARNIVAL WORKER Tickets please. \nThe two hand the Carnival Worker their tickets. \nCARNIVAL WORKER (CONT'D) Thanks for riding the Underground Jewish Railroad. If you plan on returning today, please make sure to get you hands stamped before you leave the alley. \nHAMMER Nah, we're kosher. Thanks though. \nThe two walk past him. Esther turns to the Hammer. \nESTHER So, now what? \nHAMMER Now we wait for Santa to make his next move. \nHe gives her a once over. She is stunning. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Want to get a drink? \nESTHER Sure. Why not. \nEXT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - DAY \nYour typical Blaxploitation bar. It could easily pass for the Lenox Lounge in Harlem, with the exception of the large menorah shaped sign out front. \nINT. THE GOLDEN MENORAH - CONTINUOUS \nWe see a bar packed with ORTHODOX JEWS. A WALL separating the men and women in the bar runs along the center of the room, stopping about ten feet from the stage. Signs clearly demarcate these 'MEN' and 'WOMEN' sections. \nOnstage, a KLEZMER band plays a rendition of a to be determined 70's funk classic. \nEsther and the Hammer enter the joint. Mid song, the BANDLEADER notices the two walk in... \nBANDLEADER Hey! The Hebrew Hammer everybody! \nThe Hammer raises his hand in acknowledgment. The entire bar cheers and applauds. \nShe turns around, pleasantly surprised. \nESTHER Hey. \nHAMMER Do you want to get out of here? \nShe looks relieved. \nESTHER I would love to get out of here. \nINT. THE HAMMER'S PAD - NIGHT \nA smooth, laid back Blaxploitation era song pumps from the speakers. We do a SLOW PAN from the stereo into a TIGHT SHOT of Esther and the Hammer slow dancing. Sexy. Esther grunts and moans a bit. \nWe begin a SLOW ZOOM back from the two, eventually pulling back far enough to see what Esther's moaning about. The Hammer is a seriously terrible dancer, stepping on her toes, forcing her into awkward positions, etc. \nWe see a CU of the Hammer accidentally stepping on her toes yet again. \nESTHER Ouch! \nEsther pulls herself away from the Hammer. \nHAMMER Sorry. I'm better with men. \nESTHER (Sensually) Maybe we should try a different kind of dancing. \nHAMMER You mean like disco dancing or doing the funky chicke...Oh. I get it. \nWe see a TIGHT MEDIUM SHOT of Esther. Her erect nipples are clearly outlined through her blouse. Now, the Hammer's really getting it. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Now we're talking Boobola. \nESTHER Mordechai? \nHAMMER Yes Esther. \nESTHER I want you to talk dirty to me. \nHAMMER Oh. Okay. \nHe thinks for a moment. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) I want to have lots of children by you. Get a good paying, stable job. Settle down in Long Island somewhere. Someplace nice. Fancy. But not fancy schmancy. \nShe's warming up. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) I want for our children to go to private schools and take music lessons. Little Abraham will go to Stanford for college, Batya will go Ivy League, maybe Vassar. \nESTHER Keep going. \nHAMMER Afterwards they'll make the decision as to whether or not they'd like to continue their religious studies in Israel. Because, hey, after all we'll have practiced the highly effective assertive democratic style of child rearing, sprinkled with a healthy dose of liberalism. \nShe's on fire for him. \nESTHER Oh god, yes! Keep going! Don't stop! \nHAMMER Also, on a daily basis, I want you to tell me what to do, where to do it, and how I should live my life. \nESTHER Kiss me you Semitic stud! \nShe grabs him and kisses him passionately. \nESTHER (CONT'D) (Playfully) Hmm. I feel something poking around down there. Maybe I should investigate. What do you think about that Mr. Certified Circumcised Dick? \nShe begins to unzip his pants. We cut to a shot of an excited Mordechai as we hear the sound of the unzipping of his pants reach its conclusion. \nA CU on her as she looks down at his Jewish Manhood. A wide eyed, almost shocked reaction. She slowly looks back to him and smiles slyly. \nESTHER (CONT'D) Shabat Shalom! \nSTAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: \nINT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - MAIN CHAMBER - DAY \nThe Star Of David vault-like doors open, and the Hammer and Esther hurriedly enter the room. The Chief waits for them. \nCHIEF Mordechai. Thank god you're here. \nHAMMER What's up? \nCHIEF About an hour ago, we received this transmission from the North Pole. \nHe clicks a button on a remote control, and static fills the GIANT TELECOMMUNICATIONS SCREEN, eventually fading into the image of a larger then life SANTA. \nSANTA And now my Hanukkah loving friends, I will reveal to you the true nature of my diabolical scheme. \nAn image of a GIANT CLOCK in the shape of a Star Of David. \nSANTA (V.O.) (CONT'D) The Jewish Atomic clock, located in the outskirts of Jerusalem. Keeper of time for the Jewish Calendar. Powered by Judeum. An element so rare, it exists only inside the clock itself. \nWe TILT down to reveal a BLUE GLOWING SUBSTANCE in its base. \nSanta comes back on screen. \nSANTA (CONT'D) Once I extract the Judeum from the clock, the Jewish Calendar will cease to exist, forever eradicating Hanukkah. In less than twenty four hours, which by your Jewish Calendar is approximately... \nHe struggles with this one. He looks at someone O.S. at the North Pole. \nSANTA (CONT'D) (To someone at North Pole) Can I borrow that pen and notepad? \nA notepad and pen are handed to him from O.S. Santa makes some written calculations on the notepad. He's clearly having trouble. \nThe Hammer and Esther exchange looks. \nSANTA (CONT'D) (Uncertain) Four years and three quarters a lunar cycle? (Shifting back into psycho mode) Well, whatever! In less than twenty four Christian hours, Hanukkah will be nothing more than a fond memory. Tiny Tim. \nTiny Tim hobbles into frame on his crutches. \nTINY TIM Merry Christmas everybody, and god bless us, everyone. \nThe two laugh hysterically. \nSANTA End transmission. \nThe transmission, however, doesn't end. The two abruptly stop laughing. Santa begins to talk to TINY TIM. \nSANTA (CONT'D) So, how was I? \nTINY TIM It was good. Very chilling, but you still got all the points across that we talked about. \nSANTA Really? Good, good. \nWe cut to more confused reactions of the Hammer and Esther. \nSANTA (CONT'D) I wasn't too over the top? \nTINY TIM No, it was the perfect level. \nSANTA Thanks. Oh, did I tell you. I picked up that new KC and the Sunshine Band record that you recommended. You were right, it is good. \nSanta looks towards the camera and begins to react strangely. \nSANTA (CONT'D) (To O.S. Cameraman) Why is the red light on the camera still on? Are you still filming me!? \nSanta approaches the camera. \nSANTA (CONT'D) You fucking ass... \nStatic fills the screen. \nWe cut to a sign reading \"THE WEST BANK PALMS: A GATED COMMUNITY. COMING SOON!\" On it, we see an illustration of a housing compound surrounded by a remarkable amount of BARBED WIRE. \nWe PAN over to the highway as the Hammer zips past on his motorcycle. \nINT. ESTHER'S CADILLAC - CONTINUOUS \nThe Hammer, unaware of her presence, speeds by her large Cadillac. She puts the car into gear. \nEXT. ISRAELI OPEN  HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS \nTucked out of sight behind a billboard, Esther pulls off from her side of the road and onto the highway in pursuit of the Hammer. And yes, the car is lowered, with white walled tires. \nThe camera makes it way up to reveal a large ROADSIDE BILLBOARD ARROW, resembling the ones you might see advertising casinos on the drive into Vegas announces \"THE JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK. 20 Kilometers.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. JEWISH ATOMIC CLOCK - AFTERNOON \nFrom the outside the J.A.C has the appearance of an observatory. For no apparent reason, a small MOTORCYCLE RAMP sits near the front door. \nA single Fed-Y truck pulls into the dirt parking lot. \nA gang of THUG ELVES spill out of the back of the truck as a S.W.A.T. team would. \nHEAD ELF Go, go, go! \nThe Head Elf jumps out, and out of frame. \nCUT TO: \nAn ELF FLUNKY stand by a SMALL MOTORCYCLE RAMP, studying it curiously. The Head Elf walks into frame. \nHEAD ELF (CONT'D) What's this doing here? \nELF FLUNKY Not sure. I think it was left over from an Israeli Robbie Kneivel television special. You want me to get rid of it? \nHEAD ELF No time. Besides, it's not like someone's gonna jump their motorcycle into the building while we're inside. \nThe HEAD THUG ELF points up towards the sky. \nHEAD ELF (CONT'D) There's Santa now. \nThe Thug Elves look up to the sky, and we do an OVERHEAD PUSH DOWN ON THEM as helicopter force winds blow their hats off. \nThe carriage of SANTA'S SLEIGH touches down on the ground. \nTiny Tim sits shotgun in the sleigh while Santa vomits violently over the other side. Santa finishes up, and wipes his mouth with his hand. \nTINY TIM You okay? \nSANTA No. I'm airsick you asshole! Where the hell did these reindeer learn to fly? \nTINY TIM I don't know. Why don't you ask them sir. \nSanta takes this in. \nCUT TO: \nSanta paces as a Drill Sargent would in front of the line of harnessed reindeer. They're shivering in their hooves. \nSANTA Who's the leader of this operation? \nMore scared reindeer faces. Comet furtively motions towards Rudolph with his antlers. Santa sees this, marches quickly up to Rudolph, and gets in his face. \nSANTA (CONT'D) What's your major malfunction, dumbfuck!? \nRudolph's scared shitless. \nSANTA (CONT'D) Step forward son! \nSANTA Get him boys! \nSanta's Elf Thugs open a CHEST filled with LARGE SUB-MACHINE GUNS. The chest is labeled \"HEAVY ARTILLERY.\" With great difficulty, they struggle to pull the heavy machinery out of the box. \nThe Hammer, mildly amused, watches them. \nThe Hammer blasts away, and the elves scramble for safety. The sound of gunfire is deafening and constant. \nAn Elf sneaks quietly towards Santa's gun. \nEsther walks in through the front door and spots something O.S. that gives her cause for concern. \nUnbeknownst to the Hammer, the SNEAKY ELF picks up Santa's gun.  He raises it at the Hammer, ready to fire. \nESTHER Mordechai! Behind you! \nThe Hammer turns and nails the elf just in time. \nEsther, gun drawn, backs up into frame with the Hammer, and the two fire off rounds. \nHAMMER What are you doing here? \nESTHER Mordechai, I love you. I couldn't let you do this alone. \nHAMMER I love you too. I'm sorry about freaking out yesterday. I was wrong. \nESTHER I forgive you. \nHAMMER Go check on the clock. I'll finish up here. \nWe do another QUICK PUSH into the Hammer as he turns towards Tiny Tim. \nTiny Tim, standing alone with his crutches tucked under his arms, looks like a deer caught in headlights. \nThe Hammer grins mischievously. \nTINY TIM Uh oh. \nThe Hammer begins firing. \nIn SLOW-MOTION, Tiny Tim hobbles as fast as he can towards an overturned table, gunfire trailing him. Like a pole vaulter with two poles, Tiny Tim plants his crutches firmly into the ground and launches himself over the table. \nHe lands directly on top of Santa, who cowers underneath the table. \nSANTA Get off of me you cripple! \nTINY TIM What are we gonna do? He's got us on the ropes. \nWe DOLLY BACK with the Hammer as he approaches the camera, firing rounds at the table. \nWe cut to the duct taped Hasidic Guards tied to their chairs. One of them frantically nudges the other and motions to the window. Fear fills both of their eyes. \nWe see what they see. Through the window, the SUN is quickly setting behind the mountains. \nWe cut back to the Hammer. The speed with which he shoots begins to slow. \nEsther, checking the clock for damage calls to him. \nESTHER What's the matter? \nHAMMER I don't know. I'm feeling kind of tired. \nWe cut back to Santa and Tiny Tim underneath the table. We HEAR the shooting continue to slow, until finally it ceases altogether. Santa and Tiny Tim exchange looks. \nSANTA What's going on? Why'd he stop? \nTINY TIM Maybe he ran out of ammo. \nSANTA Take a look. \nJAMAL Merry Kwanzaa nigga! \nSTAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: \nINT. JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - MAIN CHAMBER - SATURDAY NIGHT \nThe Hammer and Mohammed enter through the vault doors. The Chief waits anxiously. \nCHIEF Mordechai, you're back. The clock? \nHAMMER Still ticking. Thanks to the help from the Brothers at the KLF, Hanukkah's safe for now. \nCHIEF That's wonderful! \nThe Chief notices the Hammer's dejected look. \nCHIEF (CONT'D) So why the long face? \nHAMMER It's Esther. Santa's got her. \nCHIEF My Esther! Oh Mordechai. \nThe Chief, overcome by sadness, slumps down into a chair. \nCHIEF (CONT'D) Please. Will you help me? \nHAMMER I love her sir. If I don't help you, I won't be able to make her my wife. Mohammed Ali Paula Abdul Rahim has agreed to come with me to the North Pole on a rescue mission. \nMo, standing in the BG, gives the Chief the fist/chest salute. \nMOHAMMED Asalam Alekem. \nCHIEF (To Mo) You're a mench. Thank you. (To Hammer) Mordechai, by any means necessary, you bring my Esther back to me. Even if it requires using Judaism's most powerful weapon. \nHAMMER Oh no, not the... \nThe Chief shakes his head yes. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) There won't be any need for that sir. \nCHIEF Hammer, the fate of my daughter rests solely in your hands. \nHAMMER I know sir. I won't let you down. \nThe Hammer motions to Mo, and the two begin to leave. They pass by Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. The Hammer acknowledges him. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Sammy Davis Jr. Jr. \nSAMMY DAVIS JR. JR. You two cats are beautiful. I love you guys. You take care babe. \nMo whispers into the Hammer's ear. \nMOHAMMED What's wrong with him? \nHAMMER He's still working out some identity issues. \nSTAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: \nEXT. NORTH POLE - DAY \nThe Hammer and Mo crawl onto the snow covered bluff overlooking Santa's Workshop. With his binoculars, the Hammer scopes out the compound below. \nBINOCULAR POV - Instead of your standard two circles filling the screen, we see the world through a pair of Star Of Davids. The place resembles the exterior of an industrial warehouse, with two Elves on guard with guns. \nHAMMER It's gonna be tough, but the back entrance looks like our best bet. \nMOHAMMED I wanted to ask you, how were you able to pinpoint the exact location of Santa's workshop? We've been trying to gain that piece of surveillance for years. \nThe Hammer puts the binoculars down. \nSuddenly, the two women are pushed from his lap as a SASSY BLACK PROSTITUTE rises up between his legs from underneath the table. \nSASSY BLACK PROSTITUTE Listen motherfucker, I already told you! I don't care how much yo ass is payin' me, if you call me that one more time there ain't gonna be no more visits down to the South Pole! You feelin' me!? \nHis ego deflates a bit. \nSANTA Yes maam, loud and clear. \nTiny Tim enters the room. He has a black eye and his clothing is torn. \nSASSY BLACK PROSTITUTE Damn sugar, what happened to you? \nTINY TIM Santa, I got some really bad news. \nEXT. COMPOUND PERIMETER WALL - DAY \nThe Hammer wears Tefilon, consisting of leather straps with boxes, wrapped around his head and arms. He silently bows his head in front of the gigantic wall as he mumbles something to himself. Mo nervously scans the area for guards. \nMOHAMMED What are you doing? \nHAMMER Just praying to god that we don't kill ourselves going over this wall. \nThe Hammer unwraps his leather straps, and then tosses them high over the wall. \nThe boxes on the straps catch on a pipe. The line is pulled taut, and the boxes hold secure against the pipe. \nThe Hammer and Mo begin to scale the wall a la the 60's Batman and Robin television show. The Hammer leads the way while Mo, directly behind him, has his arms wrapped tightly around his waist. The Hammer stops climbing for a second, and turns to him. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) You know, you don't have to hold on to my waist. You're tied in. \nMo releases his arms from the Hammer's waist. Indeed, he is tied in. \nMOHAMMED I knew that. \nEXT. SANTA'S COMPOUND PERIMETER WALL - OTHER SIDE - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Hammer and Mo drop from the wall onto the ground. The Hammer looks around. \nNo guards in sight. In front of them is door clearly marked \"BACK DOOR.\" \nMOHAMMED Well, that was easy. \nMo heads for the door. The Hammer calls to him. \nHAMMER Wait! Before we enter, you need to know that my research has determined that Santa's compound is wired with the XP 2000 stereo type alarm system. \nMOHAMMED A stereo type alarm system? \nHAMMER Take a look. \nThe Hammer points to above the door. Sure enough, there sit TWO LARGE STEREO SPEAKERS. \nMOHAMMED How do we bypass it? \nHAMMER The alarm will trigger if the system detects any Non-W.A.S.P. tendencies inside the building. For example, if you were to dribble a basketball, or eat watermelon, or use the word dawg...that is, spelled with an aw as opposed to the letter o...within the confines of this workshop, the alarm would sound. \nThis pisses Mo off. \nMOHAMMED Listen cat, I'll have you know that I hate the taste of watermelon and am a terrible basketball player. \nHAMMER Well that's good news for us. It means the system is outdated. This should be easy. C'mon. \nThe two enter through the door. \nINT. SANTA'S WORKSHOP COMPOUND - CONTINUOUS \nThe Hammer shuts the door behind them. So far, so good. \nSuddenly, the two hear the sound of footsteps coming down the hall. They duck into a corner. \nHAMMER That's...that's a very good question. And I do know that it does have something to do with...dreidels, and... \nEsther chimes in. \nESTHER ...and latkes. \nHAMMER And latkes! And some miracle oil that lasted eight days. And that my friend, should've been enough for you. Take him away Mo. \nMo drags Santa out of the room. \nSANTA I'm sorry. I see the light now. I was wrong. I'm... \nAnd Santa's gone. \nThe Hammer turns to Esther, and gets down on one knee. He places a ring on her finger. \nHAMMER Esther Bloomenbergensteinenthal, will you marry me? \nShe glows. \nESTHER Yes! Of course! I'd gladly give up my last name to be with you. \nThe two kiss in celebration. \nJoe pokes his head out into the Hallway. \nJOE LIEBERMAN What happened out there? \nHe looks to the Hammer. The Hammer shrugs his shoulders. \nJOE LIEBERMAN (CONT'D) Oh Mordechai, you know how I detest gore. \nHAMMER Well then maybe you should have thought about that before you ran with him. C'mon, let's get you back to Washington. \nAnd we PULL out as the three make their way down the hallway. \nTITLE CARD: ONE WEEK LATER. CHRISTMAS EVE. \nINT. MRS. CARVER'S HOUSE - SHABAT \nMrs. Carver exits the kitchen, platters of food in hand. \nMRS. CARVER Shabat Shalom everybody! \nWe see Esther and the Hammer at the other end of the table. They smile and hold hands. Domestic bliss. \nHAMMER/ESTHER Shabat Shalom! \nWith a bit of difficulty, Mrs. Carver works her large behind into her chair. \nHAMMER And a Merry Christmas to all of our Gentile friends. Mun Chi. \nThe Hammer raises his glass in honor of Mun Chi. Mun Chi returns the gesture. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Before we start the Sabbath, I'd personally just like to thank god for all the blessings I've received over the past year. A beautiful fiancee... \nEsther smiles. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) ...a wonderful mother... \nMrs. Carver is as proud as can be... \nHAMMER (CONT'D) ...and the opportunity to help my brothers and sisters in the Jewish community. \nMRS. CARVER Well I'm just glad you're safe Bubba Shaina, and eating by your mother for Shabos. \nShe squeezes his hand. \nHAMMER Thanks mom. \n", "test1_input": "The pubic area of their dresses moisten in synchrony. \nThe Hammer winks back. \nAn OLD WOMAN calls to the Hammer from the window of a second story flat. \nOLD WOMAN Hammer, why don't you come eat by us for Shabat. My Miriam is all grown up now. God willing, you should settle down and marry. \nWe punch in to a CLOSE UP of a demure Miriam as the Hammer takes stock of the goods. She is an atrociously ugly girl wearing orthodontic headgear, and bespectacled with a pair oversized librarian's glasses. \nThe Hammer shakes off his wave of nausea. \nHAMMER Thanks for the invite Mrs. Kleinman, but right now G dash d's the only one for me. \nOLD WOMAN I can dig it. \nThe Hammer continues on down the street. The old woman and Miriam are framed in the BG. \nOLD WOMAN (CONT'D) Hammer, you're the baaddest Hebe this side of Tel Aviv. \nThe Hammer stops for a second and smiles at the compliment. \nHAMMER (To himself) Shabat Shalom! \nHe walks off frame. \nEXT. GHETTO ALLEY - MOMENTS LATER \nSome TEENAGE GENTILE BOYS play keep away with a yarmulke belonging to SHLOMO, another young Hasidic kid. \nSHLOMO Give it back! Give me back my yarmulke! \nTEENAGE GENTILE Hey Teddy, throw me the frisbee. \nTEDDY (the non-speaking teen Gentile) throws the yarmulke, and we FOLLOW it as it spins towards another TEENAGE GENTILE. The other Teenage Gentile excitedly extends his hands to catch, but right before it reaches him another hand comes into frame and snatches it. He looks up, and we cut to his... \nPOV as we tilt up to reveal The Hammer. He looks pretty damn big and pissed off from this angle. \nThe Teenage Gentile  begins to shake and stammer. \nTEENAGE GENTILE (CONT'D) We...we were going to give it back. I swear to god. \nHAMMER Did you just take god's name in vain? \nTEENAGE GENTILE No, no. It...It's not like that. We were just about... \nHAMMER Just about to leave, right? \nTEENAGE GENTILE Yeah, yeah, that's right. We were just about to leave. C'mon Teddy. \nThe two run off. \nThe Hammer looks down to Shlomo. His spirit seems broken. \nHAMMER You alright? \nSHLOMO I guess. Sometimes I wonder why I even bother praying to one god. \nHAMMER Hey, hey! Be proud of who you are. You're a bad, bold, big-nosed, biblical brother. You feelin' me? \nThe kid's morale is boosted. \nSHLOMO Yeah. You're right. \nHAMMER Aveenooh Shalom Alechem little brother. \nThe Hammer pounds his fist into his chest ala the Black Panthers. The kid returns the gesture. \nSHLOMO Thanks Hammer. \n", "test1_true": "HAMMER Stay Jewish. \nEXT. 'HEBREW HAMMER INVESTIGATIONS' OFFICE BUILDING - DAY \nThe Hammer walks up the stairs and past the sign advertising his office. \nThe Hammer theme music winds down, punctuated with Shaft-like brass hits. However, the brass hits become incredibly overblown and extraneous. \nThe Hammer walks back into frame from the stairway to his office. He looks around strangely for the source of the music. \nINT. 'HEBREW HAMMER INVESTIGATIONS' OFFICE BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER \nTIKKVA (Late 30's), the Hammer's very nasaly Laawng Island secretary, files her nails furiously as the Hammer enters the office. A MUZAK version of the Hammer Theme song plays over the office PA system. \nHAMMER Happy Hanukkah Tikva. \nTIKVA Happy Hanukkah Morty. \nThe Hammer tosses his Shtreml and we WHIP with it as lands squarely on the hat rack. \nWe cut back to the Hammer. He's wearing a yarmulke. \nHAMMER So, what's shakin' Yenta. \nTIKVA Well, for stahters, your mother called. She said to remind you that you're having Shabat Dinner by her tomorrow, and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz, and she wanted me to relate the following information to you. \nHAMMER Okay, what's the information? \nTIKVA She said to remind you that you're having Shabat dinner by her tomorrow and also to remind you to bring the Manischewitz. \nThe Hammer lets this sink in. \nHAMMER Anything else? \nTIKVA Yeah, I'm going to be out of the office from 1:30 to 3:00 on Sunday. I have a terrible yeast infection and I need to see my gynecologist. \nHAMMER But we're not open on Sundays. \nTIKVA I understand that. I just thought that you might want to know. \nHAMMER (Beat) I'll be in my office. \nThe Hammer walks into his private office and shuts the frosted glass door. We hold on what's stenciled on the outside of the door. The lettering reads, \"Mordechai Jefferson Carver - Certified Circumcised Dick - State of New York.\" \nYET TBD TRANSITION TO: \nEXT. NORTH POLE - DAY \nAn establishing shot of Santa's Workshop. The lettering \"NORTH POLE - SANTA'S WORKSHOP\" is superimposed over the picture. \nINT. SANTA'S CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nSANTA CLAUS (O.S.) I want to start by thanking all of you for pulling yourselves away from the workshop to make this emergency meeting. I know it's the busiest time of the year for all of you, so I'll try and be brief. \nAs Santa speaks, we begin on a painting of a meek and frightened looking Santa Claus. His eyes look fearfully to his right.  Below the picture frame is a plaque reading \"St. Nick the Nervous. 1871-1941\", we continue a slow DOLLY to the right on to the next picture. \nWe see another Santa Claus, much more treacherous in his appearance. His eyes are fixed menacingly on the picture of Santa to his left. The plaque below his picture read, \"St. Nick The Nasty 1941-1970.\" \nWe continue our DOLLY to the right, finally ending on a painting of a jolly, portly Santa. Below his picture the plaque reads, \"St. Nick The Nice. 1970-Christmas Present.\" \nWe cut to a WIDE shot of a Conference Room. The same nice Santa Claus from the last picture addresses a handful of ELVES. Two reindeer flank Santa on either side. Their nameplates hang from their necks - \"BLITZEN\" and \"RUDOLPH.\" \nAt the other end of the table from Santa sits his son DAMIAN, quite a nasty looking man. \nSANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) My father, often referred to as St. Nick The Nasty, was a tyrannical man. He was obsessed with making Christmas the only holiday anyone could celebrate before the New Year. Since his death, I've prided myself on ensuring that the Christmas season is one of tolerance and understanding between all races and religions. It's always been my belief that Hanukkah and Kwanzaa deserve the same respect as Christmas. \nDamian whispers to an elf on his right hand side, and then makes the JERKING OFF motion with his hand. \nSANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) Lights please. \n", "test1_id": 1551, "test2_input": "As Rudolph's nose dims, so do the lights in the room. Santa picks up a remote in his hand, and turns on a SLIDE PROJECTOR. \nSANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) Over the course of my career as Santa Claus, I've made it my mission to ensure that Jews, Christians, and African Americans could all observe their respective holidays in harmony. \nWe see a slide of THE HEBREW HAMMER, an African American man (Mohammed), and Santa Claus arm in arm below a banner in a mall reading \"HAPPY HOLIDAYS!\" \nSANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) I was responsible for pushing the Happy Holidays Ordinance, in which all Merry Christmas signage was replaced by the Trans-relgious and inoffensive phrase 'Happy Holidays.' \nWe see another slide in which an assembly of SCHOOLCHILDREN are singing. \nSANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) It was nearly a decade ago, in conjunction with our friends in the Jewish and African American communities that I supported a bill that mandated that 'Dreidel, dreidel, dreidel' and 'I'm dreaming of a bright Kwanzaa' be taught and sung in elementary schools along with the Christmas standards 'Frosty The Snowman', and 'Deck The Halls.' Which is why upon examination of my annual naughty and nice list it shocked me to discover that my own son, Damian... \nDamian, preoccupied with the cigarette he's attempting to light, looks up in response to his name. A brown bagged bottle of booze now sits on the table in front of him. We can see Santa and the reindeer in silhouette on the slide projection screen behind him. \nSANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) The heir to the Red Suit could be so filled with hate. \nSanta addresses Damian. \nSANTA CLAUS (CONT'D) Damian, when I learned of your ludicrous scheme to wipe out Hanukkah, my first reaction was one of disgust. Now, I'm only filled with sadness and disappointment. Disappointed that I failed to teach you the true meaning of Christmas. What do you have to say for yourself? \nWe being a SLOW PUSH into Damian as he ponders the question. The cigarette dangles from his lips. \nRudolph nods to Blitzen. Blitzen returns the gesture with a nod of acknowledgment. \nWith a slow and measured pace Damian says... \nDAMIAN Ho. Ho. Ho. \nOn the slide projector screen behind Damian, we see the silhouetted images of Blitzen and Rudolph goring Santa through the chest with their antlers. Damian cringes. \nBlood trickles from Santa's mouth, and with his last breath he utters the words... \nSANTA CLAUS Et tu, Blitzen? \nSanta falls out of frame with a thud. Standing behind him with bloodied antlers is Blitzen. \nDamian walks over to the newly deceased Santa, takes his bloodstained Santa's hat, and put it on his own head. From this point on in the screenplay, Damian will now be referred to as SANTA. \nThe elves in the room, in various stages of shock, stare at their new master in horror. \nSANTA What are you fucking midgets looking at!? Get back to work! We have Hanukkah to destroy! \nSTAR OF DAVID WIPE TO: \nEXT. THE JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - DAY \nA building resembling the Pentagon with the exception that it's shaped like the Star Of David. Superimposed over the picture are the words, \"JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE.\" \nINT. THE JEWISH DEFENSE LEAGUE - DAY \nA smoky chamber reminiscent of the Senate or the United Nations. A GIANT BANNER reading \"HANUKKAH NOW!,\" illustrated with a Hasid in silhouette with his fist raised, covers the back wall behind the men. \nAs with the Senate House Committee, various factions of the JDL sit behind plaques describing the group they represent. We see members from: The Anti-Defamation League, Jews Against Drunk Driving, etc. A chair belonging to THE COALITION OF JEWISH ATHLETES is empty. \nThe floor is chaotic. The JDL Chief bangs his gavel and yells... \nCHIEF Gentleman! \nHis pleas for silence are ignored. \nCHIEF (CONT'D) Gentleman! Please! \nStill chaos. He flips a light switch on and off a few times as he says... \nCHIEF (CONT'D) Sheket B'vakasha! Sheket B'vakasha! \nThe entire hall responds in unison... \nHALL Hey! \n", "test2_true": "CHIEF The time for action is now. We predict that the St. Nick Day Massacre will put Hanukkah-Christmas relations back at least a hundred years. With this meshuggena new Santa Claus in power, Hanukkah is in jeopardy.

Mr. Chairman of the Worldwide Jewish Media Conspiracy. \nHARVEY WEINSTEIN sits before a plaque reading, \"HARVEY WEINSTEIN - CHAIRMAN WORLDWIDE JEWISH MEDIA CONSPIRACY\" \nHARVEY WEINSTEIN Yes Chief. \nCHIEF We need your people to crank out a couple more award winning documentaries on the Holocaust, possibly a new Adam Sandler movie. \nThe CHAIRMAN OF THE ANTI-DEFAMATION LEAGUE pipes in. \nADL CHAIRMAN Not another Adam Sandler movie! \nHARVEY WEINSTEIN What's wrong with Adam Sandler movies? \nADL CHAIRMAN We're trying to create goodwill here. I just think... \nHARVEY WEINSTEIN Frankly, I don't care what you think. I think you're a putz. \nThe plaque reading \"Anti-Defamation League\" is clearly framed in this shot. \nADL CHAIRMAN (Beat) Don't defame me. I'm against that. \nCHIEF Focus people. Our next order of business is to assign an agent to track Santa's activities. Step in and use force if the situation calls for it. We need to put the toughest Jew we have on the case. Suggestions? Suggestions, anybody? \nOne of the JDL MEMBERS calls out. \nJDL MEMBER 1 What about Steven Spielberg? \nCHIEF C'mon, he made ET. We need someone tough people. \nA SECOND MEMBER calls out. \nJDL MEMBER 2 What about Itzahk Perlman? \nCHIEF He's in a wheelchair for crying out loud. \nWe stay on the chief while we hear offscreen... \nJDL MEMBER'S 3 AND 4 (O.S.) Allen Greenspan? Henry Kissinger? \nCHIEF Too old. \nADL CHAIRMAN Joe Lieberman? \nCHIEF Missing in action. \nJDL MEMBER 1 Robert Shapiro? \nCHIEF He's a lawyer. We're looking for heros people. \nHARVEY WEINSTEIN David Copperfield? \nCHIEF What's he gonna do, make Santa disappear? Think people think. We need a hard hittin' Hebe on this one. \nAt the back of the room, ESTHER (25), a Semitic siren, pushes her way to the front. A black skirt covers every inch of her sexy figure. \nESTHER What about Mordechai Jefferson Carver? \nThe hall fills with hushed voices as the various members of the JDL whisper to one another. \nCHIEF The Hebrew Hammer? No. No way. After the way he handled that situation in the West Bank? He's the only Jew in the world too extreme for the JDL. There's a reason why we kicked him out of our ranks, sweetheart. We need a man who can follow orders. A man with self-control. We need a man... \nThe COUNCIL ELDER, a sage looking elderly Jewish man interrupts. The plaque in front of him reads, \"SAGE ELDERLY JEWISH LEADER.\" \nCOUNCIL ELDER ...We need a man who can get the job done. \nESTHER Daddy, he's our only hope. And you know it. \nThe Chief nods his head reluctantly. \n", "test2_id": 1552, "test3_input": "He takes off down the hall after Santa. \nCUT TO: \nANOTHER CORRIDOR \nMo catches up to the hobbling Tiny Tim, and begins to mock the manner and speed at which he runs, running side by side with him, circling around him as he attempts to get away, etc. \nRealizing that it'd be impossible to outrun him, Tiny Tim comes to a stop. \nMo trains his pistol on him. \nMOHAMMED Now I'm gonna do to you what I should have done earlier. \nTiny Tim closes his eyes in anticipation of the worst. \nMo grabs both of his crutches from under his arm and runs off. Tiny Tim wobbles a few steps and then slumps down against the wall. We PULL AWAY from Tiny Tim as he calls to Mo. \nTINY TIM My crutches. Noooo. Not my crutches. \nINT. SANTA'S CONFERENCE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSanta enters the room and begins to frantically barricade the front door with anything he can find: a chair, a large crucifix, a CART OF TOMATOES. Feeling confident that the door is secure, he turns around to find the Hammer standing in front of him. \nThe Hammer grabs Santa by his shirt. \nHAMMER Where's my girlfriend Santa? \nSANTA I don't have to tell you anything Hammer! You're gonna have to kill me before I tell you! \nThe Hammer's confused. \nHAMMER But if I kill you, then you'll be dead. \nSanta thinks about this for a couple seconds. \nSANTA Good point. \nThe Hammer looks up from his interrogation and spots a sign taped to a door directly behind Santa. It reads, \"THE ROOM WHERE THE HEBREW HAMMER'S GIRLFRIEND IS.\" \nThe Hammer grins mischievously at Santa. \nHAMMER Don't worry your pretty little head. \nHammer fires a single round past camera. RED SPLATTERS his face. \nWe cut to the other side. Santa cowers by the cart of TOMATOES. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) That was a warning shot. \nWe hear Esther screaming from inside the room. \nESTHER (O.S.) Mordechai! I'm in here! Help! \nThe Hammer turns towards the sound. \nSuddenly, Santa kicks the Hammer's gun out of his hand, and then draws a pistol from behind his belt and points it at him. \nSANTA Looks like the tables have turned once again Hammer. \nMore screaming from Esther behind the door. \nSANTA (CONT'D) And you won't even be able to say goodbye to your Esther. So sad. So long Mordechai. Give my father my regards. \nSanta readies to fire. \nHAMMER Wait! I didn't want it to come to this, but you leave me no choice. I have no other option but to use the most powerful weapon in the Jewish arsenal. \nThe Hammer closes his eyes and puts his hands together as if in meditation. Santa looks around nervously. \n", "test3_true": "The Hammer meditates for a bit more. Suddenly, his eyes open and he begins... \nHAMMER I shlepped all the way to the North Pole for this? I come to fight you, and you don't even put out anything to nosh on? What kind of arch nemesis are you? \nSANTA Hah! Jewish guilt. Well, it won't work on me Hammer. I'm too strong for it. \nEsther continues to scream for help. This makes the Hammer even more determined. \nHAMMER What sort of host would treat company this way? Esther is clearly uncomfortable in your guest room. I'm shvitizing from running around shooting people. And my feet. What kind of flooring is this anyway? My arches are killing me. \nIt's beginning to work on Santa. \nSANTA No. Stop it! \nHAMMER And to top it off, you didn't even have the courtesy to give me a proper hello when I entered the room. What have I ever done to you to be treated with such disrespect? \nSanta's a wreck. \nSANTA Please, make it stop. I'll do anything. Here take my gun. \nHe hands his piece to the Hammer and kneels on the ground, pointing to his head. \nSANTA (CONT'D) Shoot me. Please, just one to the head. Put me out of misery. \nMo enters the room. \nMOHAMMED Hammer, you alright? \nHAMMER Everything's kosher. Watch him for me. \nINT. ROOM WHERE THE HEBREW HAMMER'S GIRLFRIEND IS - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Hammer kicks open the door. \nHAMMER Esther! \nESTHER Mordechai! \nShe is restrained to a chair. The Hammer quickly unties her, and the two kiss. \nAs they continue kissing, we hear the sound of someone CLEARING THEIR THROAT. The Hammer looks towards the source of the noise to see none other than JOSEPH LIEBERMAN. Joe is tied to a chair, and wears a Gore/Lieberman 2000 campaign button. \nHAMMER Joseph Lieberman? \nThe Hammer begins to untie Joe. \nJOSEPH LIEBERMAN Mordechai! Thank god you're here. \nEsther looks at the Hammer curiously. \nESTHER You two know each other? \nHAMMER We go to the same temple. \nAll three step back into Santa's Conference Room. Mo continues to hold Santa at gunpoint. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) Mo, get him out of my sight. \nMo begins to take Santa away. \nThe Hammer turns around. \nHAMMER (CONT'D) No, wait. I need closure here. (To Santa) I just wanna say one thing. You know where you messed up Santa? You underestimated the true meaning of Hanukkah. \nSanta's a broken man. He gets on his knees and inquires earnestly... \nSANTA Please tell me. What is the true meaning of Hanukkah? \nThe Hammer thinks about this for a second. He's drawing a blank. He looks to Esther, and she shrugs back at him. \n", "test3_id": 1553}

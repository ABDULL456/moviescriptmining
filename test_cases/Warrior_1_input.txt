STEPHON How many laws this dude got? 
BRENDAN (LAUGHING) The dude? The dude has three. Newton the dude says that for every action, there's an equal and opposite reaction. 
Brendan looks toward the classroom door, where two red-and- white clad CHEERLEADERS are peering in, then walks over to KC, a blonde cheerleader seated in his class. She is working a Blackberry and doesn't notice him approaching. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) For example, if KC does not stop the action of sending texts in class... 
Brendan stands directly in front of her desk. She quickly shoves the Blackberry under a stack of books. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) ...and tell her posse outside to beat it... 
He turns and shoos away the two cheerleaders peering in the window. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) ...then my reaction might be to send her down to Principal Zito's office. Thus setting our world back in proper balance. 
KC Mr. C, I put it away. 
The class busts on KC as Brendan walks back to his desk and sits on top of it. It's clear from the vibe in the room that he's a very popular teacher. Then the BELL rings. 
BRENDAN Alright, before you go, I have your tests from last week. 
INT. COLT'S PITTSBURGH FIGHT CLUB - DAY 
Fenroy sits at the front desk and looks at his computer. Watches "MMA LIVE" and another feature on the big upcoming Sparta tournament. 
Tommy, wearing a wife beater and old gray sweats, works a bag and eyeballs an ENTOURAGE that surrounds a ring. Inside, a heavily-muscled FIGHTER with a mohawk, MAD DOG GRIMES (30s), is putting a beating on his SPARRING PARTNER. The obsequious nature of the entourage makes it clear that Mad Dog is somebody important. 
In the ring, the sparring partner takes a vicious spinning back fist to the chin, goes down in a heap, and doesn't get up. COLT BOYD (40s), clearly in charge, throws up his hands as Mad Dog laughs. 
MAD DOG Where do you find these girls? 
Colt climbs into the ring and looks at the fallen fighter. Glances at Mad Dog. 
COLT BOYD We got a tournament coming up. You gonna kill every guy in the `Burgh? (TO FENROY) Fenroy. Get me some ice. And call that Puerto Rican kid, the one that fights outa the Bottoms. If he's here in 20 minutes, he gets 200 bucks. 
TOMMY Yo, I'll fight him. 
Colt turns around and looks at Tommy. As does Mad Dog, who smiles down at him from inside the ring. 
COLT BOYD Do me a favor guy, go back to your bag. We don't need anybody else getting hurt. G'head. Take a walk. 
Tommy walks back to his bag. Mad Dog smiles. Looks at Tommy's outfit. 
MAD DOG Yo Rock, what happened? You leave Mick and Paulie at home today? 
Tommy stops. Walks back to the ring as Fenroy approaches. 
FENROY (TO COLT) His phone's disconnected. 
COLT BOYD Then go through the list. Get me Joe Bones. 
TOMMY (TO COLT) All I'm saying is if you need somebody to help you, I'm happy to keep your boy warm for you. 
Colt looks at Mad Dog. What do you think? The Mohawked fighter looks at Tommy. Shrugs. It's his funeral. 
COLT BOYD You ever fought before? 
TOMMY Yeah. 
Colt studies Tommy. Sees he's serious. Gives in. 
COLT BOYD (TO FENROY) This guy sign a waiver? 
FENROY All good. 
COLT BOYD What's your name?

KELLY Password. 
Bart steps out of the barn. 
KELLY Hey! Where the hell have you been? 
BART No where. 
KELLY They put you over here with me? That's great. I think we'll get some close- ups. They want me to drive old Lippy. Isn't that awesome? 
Bart doesn't say anything. 
KELLY What the hell's your problem? 
BART I ought to fucking kill you. 
KELLY What? 
BART You had to do it. 
Kelly shakes his head, avoiding Bart's eyes, trying to keep it normal. 
KELLY What are you talking about? 
BART You just do whatever the fuck you want. And consequences don't matter, do they? 
KELLY Are you out of your mind? 
Bart looks at Kelly. Sees nothing but a kid in an old Army uniform. 
BART What the fuck do you think she's going to do, run off with you? 
The blood rises to Kelly's face. 
But he still won't look at Bart. 
BART You're a seventeen-year-old bag boy. She's a Yale grad student. Talk about living in a fucking fantasy world. 
Kelly's hands turn white around the rifle. 
KELLY No. You'd rather have me be miserable like you are. 
Bart comes closer. Uncomfortably close. 
BART (biting sarcasm) Once again, you've displayed your uncanny ability to nail the truth of a character. 
Kelly finally raises his head. 
And looks Bart right in the eyes. 
KELLY Stop talking out your dad's mouth and use your own for once. 
Bart lunges at Kelly. 
EXT. FILM SHOOT 
The camera's set up. 
The groups are in position. 
The A.D. stands by the cameraman. 
A.D. Standby for rehearsal. Cue the explosion. 
GRAY CLOUD EXPLODES 
In the field. Soldiers leap out of trenches. 
A.D. Cue the Jeep. 
Nothing happens. 
A.D. Cue the Jeep. Cue the fucking Jeep! 
The A.D. shakes his head. 
BEHIND THE BARN 
The A.D. comes around the corner followed by the cameraman. 
Bart and Kelly roll around on the ground. 
A.D. What the H. Christ is going on over here? 
Bart and Kelly continue to fight. 
A.D. (to cameraman) Hey, roll this. Get this. Are you getting this? 
The cameraman puts his camera up to his eye and films.

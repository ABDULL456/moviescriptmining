{"test1_input": "The DOOR flies open and ANOTHER OFFICER strides in. Paunchy, moustached. The room is suddenly silent as we TRACK him in, followed by a grinning civilian FLUNKY with a big portable photo instrument and bulb. \nTHE FIRST OFFICER jumps up from the desk, makes an obsequious salute to the SECOND OFFICER who arrogantly acknowledges it and takes the vacated chair behind the desk. The FIRST OFFICER moves to the first fold-up chair in the row, pushing the police officer in that chair further down. THIS OFFICER, in turn, shoves the next man down. It goes all the way down the line like a comedy until the last man in the row stands up against the wall. But this is all in the background as: \nSECOND OFFICER Name? \nBILLY William Hayes. \nSECOND OFFICER Vil... Vilyum...? \nBILLY Hayes... \nSharp SOUND OFF of FILM BEING RIPPED FROM CAMERA. He darts a look at \nPOLICEMAN stretching the undeveloped film out.  Another loud SOUND OFF, interrupting this-- \nTHE DOOR flies open again and a THIRD OFFICER strides in, obviously the most important yet, because the SECOND OFFICER jumps up from the desk, and all the others immediately move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moment's hesitation. But the THIRD OFFICER strides right up to Billy, waves to the SECOND OFFICER.  THE CAMERAMAN in background bubbles with enthusiasm, sliding into position. Billy is puzzled - what's going on?  His arm is grabbed and he is swivelled around. \nREVERSE ANGLE - OVER CAMERAMAN \nBILLY in the middle, flanked by SECOND and THIRD OFFICER, grinning like big game hunters, their arms on his shoulders. The FIRST OFFICER, sticking a bunch of hashish plaques into Billy's hands, runs OUT OF FRAME. BILLY looks from side to side. The SECOND OFFICER pats him hard on the back of the head, meaning 'look at camera'. BILLY glances at him, sees the grin on both the officers' faces. Thinking this is the necessary expression, he grins at the camera. \nCAMERAMAN disgustedly looks up from his eyepiece. \nCAMERAMAN No.. He's smiling. Make him look miserable. \nSECOND OFFICER slugs BILLY in the stomach with a quick back-handed fist. BILLY groans, sinks to his knees. The plaques fall on the floor. \nFIRST OFFICER (running up) Gel?  Gel?? \nHe growls, grabbing Billy's arm and hauling him up, gathering the hashish plaques and putting them back in his arms. The TWO OFFICERS put their arms back on Billy's shoulders. BILLY, in pain, makes the proper expression of misery. \nFLASH!  The bulb goes. \nCUT: \nTHE 707 PAN AMERICAN PLANE, destination New York, roars up into the sky. PULL BACK all the way to BILLY sitting next to the window, huddled over, feeling woozy and near vomiting.  He glimpses the plane but it is anti-climatic now; as he stares down at his boots. Then remembers something! Surprised. \nANOTHER ANGLE - ROOM. The Turkish OFFICERS talk AD LIB among themselves, congratulating, slapping shoulders, pointing to the hashish plaques, etc. \nIn center background, we see BILLY submissively lifting his arm for permission to speak, \nTHIRD OFFICER nods, approaches, followed by OTHERS. \nBILLY slowly, partly out of pain, pulls off one of his boots, bangs it on the heel and two more PLAQUES clatter to the floor. \nTURKISH MOUTHS drop open. \nBILLY finishes the process with the other boot. An awkward silence OFF. \nBILLY (trying to explain, innocent) I forgot... I really did. (makes ineffective gestures) \nANOTHER ANGLE. The room explodes with screams and commotion. AD LIB: \nTHIRD OFFICER (screaming at SECOND OFFICER) You idiot, you fool. You told me the American was searched... and he's pulling hashish out of his boots!  You're all dogshit! \nSECOND OFFICER (turning on First Officer, screaming) You worthless piece of garbage, where did you learn to search a prisoner?  He's been in our custody for an hour, etc. \nFIRST OFFICER (screaming at the others) Who searched him?  Who? \nAmid all the screaming TWO POLICEMEN rush over and yank BILLY upwards, and start to strip all his clothes. \nBILLY (protesting) That's it! That's all I have! \nCUT: \nBILLY spread-eagled STARK NAKED against the wall. He is afraid to move. A strange silence. \nANOTHER ANGLE. BILLY naked in center B.G. against the wall.The OFFICERS and SOLDIERS quietly leering at his trim, muscular buttocks. Hungry stares.  Bisexuality is prevalent in Turkey.But there is also embarrassment among the officers; none would do anything openly in front of the others; instead they just stare and smoke their cigarettes. Low murmurs. Continued telephone calls. Much thick smoke all over the room. \nAnother DOOR opens OFF. Obsequious GREETINGS in Turkish. \nBILLY is afraid to look over his shoulder, feeling enormously humiliated. \nVOICE (OFF) Howdy, Billy. Howya doing, Ok? \nA perfect Texas drawl. BILLY glances over his shoulder. Sees: \nTEX a tall, lanky blonde-haired American in a business suit with boots. Clean cut, very handsome, with a strong flavour of danger in his blue eyes. \nTEX (smiling, extends Billy's clothes) I think these gentlemen have finished for the time being if you'd like to put your clothes on. \nANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, so grateful at last to see a fellow American, reaches quietly for the clothes, his eyes never leaving Tex. Release? \nCUT: \nTURKISH DETECTIVE sits at the main desk in the room.  Unlike the others, he has no moustache; a skeletal face, intelligent looking.  TEX Is behind, leaning casually up against the wall. Angled to Billy's side is the entire array of seated OFFICERS looking on like a tribunal. \n", "test1_true": "BILLY, standing to the side of the desk, clothed now, buckling his belt - afraid. \nBILLY No, I'm not afraid. \nDETECTIVE Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes? \nBILLY (softly, hoping) Yes...? \nDETECTIVE Good. Now, where did you get the hashish? \nBILLY A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar. \nDETECTIVE Would you recognize him again? \nBILLY Yes.  I think so. \nDETECTIVE Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him? \nBILLY'S EYES MOVE TO: \nTEX who makes a cool affirmative nod of the eyes to Billy. \nBILLY (OFF) Yes. \nSTREETS, ISTANBUL, AFTERNOON. TEX drives his American CAR; BILLY in the passenger seat; TWO TURKISH PLAINCLOTHESMEN in the rear seats . Various BACKGROUND SHOTS of the city. \nTEX (casual tone) You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all. \nBILLY (shakes his head) Stupid. \nTEX Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got... \nBILLY But didn't have heroin. \nTURK (grins) Well I'm not up on all that. A drug's a drug seems to me Billy and... \nBILLY (sweating) But it was my first time. I'm not really a smuggler, was just two kilos. \nTEX Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade. \nBILLY But just... \nTEX Just what? \nBILLY I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and... \nIt sounds bad. Tex looks at him without expression. Pause.Billy tries to sense a sympathy in this ambiguous man, a liking towards himself. But feels nothing yet, except someone who can speak English. \nBILLY ...are you with the Consulate? \nTEX (not looking at him) Something like that. Cigarette? \nANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY nervously takes the pack and matches. \nTEX How much you pay this joker... this cab driver? \nBILLY Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred. \nTEX How much did you figure to make? \nBILLY fumbles to light up his cigarette. He is nervous, grateful to volunteer any information...anything. \nBILLY Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash-- (shakes his head) ...it just seemed like easy money. \nTEX Beats working. \nBILLY I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest. \nTEX grins, sceptical of his naivete, changing the subject. \nTEX Got a family back there? \nBILLY (inhales deeply) Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island. \nTEX What's your father do? \nBILLY He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life. \nTEX (a pause, not looking at Billy) Be tough on 'em. \nBILLY nods, takes a deep drag on his cigarette. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nTEX Girlfriend? \nBILLY ...She was on the plane. \n", "test1_id": 0, "test2_input": "BILLY Shit!  Shit!  Shit! \nMAX (slumping to the ground) It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up. \nBELL What the fuck we gonna do? \nSILENCE as the three pathetic escapees ponder their fate. \nBILLY, getting a grip on himself, thinking. \nBILLY We go back. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nMAX What?  You gotta be joking. \nBILLY (resolute) We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace. (rises) Now let's go.  Doubletime! \nTakes the THREAD and starts to follow it back. \nCUT: \nTHE SHAFT. BILLY leads the climbers UP. \nMAX reaches a new foothold, stops, getting his breath. Looks down at BELL heavy breathing OFF.  Urging him on. \nMAX You gotta have a lot of balls for this \nBELL, suffering, can't help but grin. \nBELL (murmurs) Count me out. (to himself, shaking his head) Who ever heard of anybody sneaking back into a fucking jail? \nMAX overhearing it. \nMAX Yeah, what if got caught? \nBELL starts to giggle. \nBILLY (OFF) (up the shaft) Hey Max, don't make the dummy laugh. \nMAX laughing, shaking his head. \nMAX (between giggles) Who's laughing?  I mean I find this terribly depressing... Can you see old Hamidou's face when he tries to figure this one out? \nBILLY can't go on, starts to giggle at the thought. \nBILLY (between giggles) We'll tell him we were checking out our escape route.  We wanted to be completely sure before we tried it. \nANOTHER ANGLE - the THREE of them, spaced along the shaft, are all giggling hysterically. Echoing. HOLD ON them. \nCUT: \nBILLY comes through the HOLE in the stones in the SINK AREA.  It is still NIGHT.  He looks around - silence. MAX follows through the hole. \nCUT: \nBILLY and MAX work fractically to seal up the STONES. \nBELL, exhausted, is at the STAIRS guarding. Distant early morning SOUNDS of prison waking up.  We feel they will be spotted this time, but: \nCUT: \nBILLY slumps into his BUNK as the first rays of LIGHT come up in the sky and the CHANT from the Mosque commences.  He immediately sinks into sleep. \nCLOSE on OLD TEA LEAVES being washed in the SINK.  A MILKY WHITE EYE follows into view.  ZIAT is preparing his early morning tea, his good eye now moving to something beyond the tea leaves. Curious, he straightens, throwing the withered bunch of leaves the sink. \nZIAT approaches the irregular stucco paste around the REPLACED STONES; runs his fingers along the ridges, noticing the paste is fresh. \nBILLY snoring from fatigue.  BELL wakes him quickly. \nBELL Billy, wake up!  They found it! \nOFF there is a lot of SHOUTING downstairs. \nBILLY Who? \nBELL Ziat! \nCUT: \nBILLY standing in a group of PRISONERS with BELL and MAX. He has a look of total despair on his face, as he watches. \nTHE SINK.  PRISONERS are everywhere jabbering excitedly among themselves.  ZIAT is conferring with HAMIDOU as GUARDS rip out the last stone, revealing the HOLE leading to the SHAFT. \nBILLY's gaze shifts to ZIAT fixing all his hatred on him. \nZIAT grinning, moves away, and his falaka stick cocked like a sergeant major - moves among the prisoners. \n", "test2_true": "They all fall immediately silent.  HAMIDOU continues his walk among them, bypassing: \nMAX who shifts his gaze onto: \nBILLY.  HAMIDOU approaches, his eyes moving over BILLY with contempt, and shifting him aside with the stick. To him Billy is the same passive prisoner as before. He moves on, shifting OTHERS aside and then stops at: \nBELL.  HAMIDOU swings his stick up slowly and taps him lightly on the chest. BELL realizes and is afraid. \nHAMIDOU No do!  No do!  I tell you I see you again.. Finish! \nHe punctuates this last with a theatrical tap on the chest and he gestures to the GUARDS. \nHAMIDOU Take him! \nBELL, already broken by bad beatings, shivers. \nBELL. No!  Oh no!  No... \nGUARDS grab him, hurry him out the Kogus behind HAMIDOU \nBILLY holds himself rigid, trying not to break. Bell's PROTESTS continue OFF. \nMAX unable to contain his anger, strides right up to ZIAT, collars him, livid. \nMAX You bastard! This time I'm gonna kick your fucking brains all over this kitchen! \nZIAT (calm) Fine.  Good.  Man to man.  We fight now.  And when finish I bring Hamidou and he kick you fuckinq ass. \nMAX is about to swing when BILLY grabs him. \nBILLY Max! Cool it! (looking at Ziat calmly) Ziat's just doing his job. \nZIAT Glances from BILLY back to MAX fixing on him as BILLY walks him away. \nCUT: \nMAX is at his BUNK that NIGHT; puts away the hypodermic needle, stoned and speeding at the same time, smoking a cigarette.  BILLY inwardly tense, sits with his head in his hands. \nMAX Bell's gonna talk. They got to find out. Man, we gotta out. \nTears have formed in his eyes. \nMAX Goddamn Gastro's killing me.  Making me blind. Hey Billy! \nBILLY (sympathetic) Yeah. \nMAX I got some acid man.  Maybe we can drop some on the guards huh? In their tea or something. \nBILLY looks away, not even considering. But MAX is caught up in the notion. \nMAX Yeah I got it all worked out. Billy, listen to me. (looks at Billy, his eyes glazed) That old guard likes you, You drop some acid on him.  When he's Seeing rainbows yer know. walk out - tonight. \nBILLY Then we're outside the kogus. Then what? \nMAX What? \nBILLY After we're outside the kogus? \nMAX Oh we... we... \nBILLY Max... Your BILLY shirt's on fire... \nMAX clumsily brushes the burning ash off his shirt where it's made a hole. \nMAX Oh shit!  Oh Christ! \nHis eyes cloud with tears.  He sits down, head between his hands. \nMAX There just comes a time you know... you know you're never going to git it on. \nSuddenly shifts mood again, stands, pulling out a SHIV, resolute, eyes brightening. \nMAX That's what I'm gonna do. (giggles) \nBILLY looks up wondering. \nBILLY What? \nMAX (crazily) Cut his fucking throat. \nBILLY Whose? \nMAX ZIAT... What do I got to lose huh! What do I got to lose. And I'd really enjoy it. \nLurches against the bunk. \nBILLY Max, sit down. You're in no shape to kill anybody. \n", "test2_id": 1, "test3_input": "TWO ATTENDANTS in smocks indifferently finish eating on a newspaper spread across one of the beds; they shake out the paper. \nCHICKEN BONES, ORANGE PEELS hitting the floor. A flurry of movement, as the LUNATICS scuffle like rats over the left- overs. AD LIB curses, yells. \nAN OLD MAN obscenely gestures to BILLY from his bed. \nOLD MAN Hey American.  Fik!  Fick!  Come. Fik!  Fik! \nHis blackened teeth leer. \nBILLY, seemingly immune to all of this in some private island of his own madness, walks in his determined way past a PARTITION to: \nA CIRCULAR STONE STAIRCASE leading downwards, the stones damp, dark, slippery. BILLY continues with the same straight- ahead determination to: \nA LONER LEVEL. at last BILLY's expression changes to almost childish relief, for here at last is the refuge he seeks the relative comfort and silence of THE WHEEL. \nIt is a grim, squat PILLAR dominating the room and bearing the weight of the ceiling. And around it some SIXTY LUNATICS trudge slowly, near silently, in counter-clockwise flow. It is a hypnotic shuffle and BILLY blends right in, sliding easily into the sluggish, mindless river, his eyes hanging loosely on the floor, watching: \nTHE SOOTHING RHYTHM OF FEET shuffling at a comforting pace. These are the spokes of the wheel. \nCUT: \nTWO TINY BARE LIGHT-BULBS give faint, eerie illumination to the chamber. One one side, a pot-bellied stove flickers, etching the shadows of the walkers in a strange orange glow. \nSOME LUNATICS, not walking, hover around the stove.  OTHERS are jammed onto a low L-shaped wooden platform that runs the length of two walls. of these men are naked, covered with open running sores over their knees, elbows, buttocks. But they are much quieter than the upstairs crowd. They are the lowest order of madmen. They have no minds left. They are the damned. \nBILLY walks among them, expressionless. A tall, thin cadaverous TURK with a grizzled beard now shuffles up alongside BILLY, looks at him, walks with him. is about fifty, his pyjamas relatively clean, looking more sane than the average but his eyes are bright and scary and his wet hair is matted down on his head, and big clumps of it have been pulled out. He speaks with a cultured English accent. \nAHMET You're an American? \nBILLY is interrupted but keeps his eyes on the ground. AHMET doesn't wait for an answer. \nAHMET Ah yes, America!  My name is Ahmet. I studied philosophy at Harvard for many many years. But actually Oxford is my real Alma  Mata - I've also studied in Vienna. Now I study here. \nBILLY doesn't notice, shuffles along. \nAHMET ...They put me here. They say I raped a little boy. I have been here very long time. They will never let me go. \nBILLY pays no attention, keeps shuffling on.  Glances at him, smiles. \nAHMET They won't let YOU go either. \nThe smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord deep inside Billy, because Billy glances briefly at this lunatic who is smiling. Billy looks back at his feet. \nAHMET No, they'll never let you go. They tell you they let you go but you stay. You never go from here. \nBILLY plods on. grins and tries to explain the situation like a father lecturing a child. \nAHMET You see we all come from a factory. Sometimes the factory makes bad machines that don't work. They put them here. The bad machines don't know they're bad machines, but the people at the factory know. They know one of the machines that doesn't work... \nThey walk on.  Ahmet's expression changes. \nAHMET (polite) I think we have spoken enough for today.  I say good night to you. \nHe wraps his rags around himself quite carefully and we FOLLOW him out of the circle. He drops to his hands and knees and with a sense of dignity, crawls into the filthy blackness under the L-shaped wooden platform, disappearing like a cockroach. \nBILLY plods on. \nCUT: \nAN OLD WHITE-BEARDED MADMAN the Hoja, grandiose in his rags, leads MUSLIM PRAYER in the first ROOM. Some of his followers have prayer mats, others a scrap of sheet or newspaper; their tones discordant, still pushing and shoving at each other during the prayer. \nTWO SPASTICS can't follow the routine of kneeling and bending; they tangle up absurdly and fall to the floor in a ball of arms and legs. \nA FALAKA STICK pokes BILLY wake SOUND of the CHANTING fills room. It is evidently impossible to distinguish night from day because there are no windows. \nATTENDANTS poke the LUNATICS awake with their \"clubs. \nATTENDANTS Head count!  Head count! \nCUT: \nA MASS OF LUNATICS in the ROOM all at once.  Attendants take a redundant and comic head count. The place sounds like a \"yadi yadi room\" the noise fearsome. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nATTENDANT #1 Sixty two, sixty three, sixty four.... \nATTENDANT #2 Seventy four, seventy five, seventy six.. .get back there, you! . . . seventy five, seventy six....) \nATTENDANTS poke around underneath a bed and pull out a very old trembling VEGETABLE. \nOTHER ATTENDANTS wrap an old DEAD LUNATIC with no teeth and foam on his open lips into a dirty sheet and haul him away. \nBILLY amid the LUNATICS.  We MOVE closer and closer to him, the head COUNT regressing. The room has become a torture cell - the NOISE LOUDER, LOUDER, closing in on Billy. \nCUT: \n", "test3_true": "A VISITING room - Cabins are lined up like narrow wooden phone booths. \nHAMIDOU Kabin on-yedi \nBILLY plods without interest to the specified cabin, closes the door, sits in the chair. No one is there. He waits - indifferent to any sense of time. Dirty two glass panes separate visitor and prisoner booths; bars are between the panes.  An erratic microphone is the method of communication, giving a weird and distant aspect to the voice. \nHAMIDOU opens a small peep-hole in the cabin door, looks in unseen as: \nTEE VISITOR DOOR opens and SUSAN tentatively walks in holding a large photo album; it takes several moments for her to react, and then her face shows the shock. \nBILLY stares at her, his face rabid, decaying; if he remembers her even, he doesn't register it because she is a shock to him as well. Reality, the outside world all at once. His mind is spinning, unbalanced, unable to grasp it. \nSUSAN (OFF) Oh my God...! \nSUSAN \nSUSAN Billy, what have they done to you...my God! \nThe MICROPHONE makes her voice jarring, gagged. She looks silently.  No sobbing, no big sad looks. Just shock.  Shock of recognition, shock of time gone by. \nBILLY looking at her, his eyes moving down to: \nBILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN, her neck, her breasts straining against the thin shirt. \nSUSAN fingers the photo album nervously, speaking slow and distinct; not sure she is communicating. \nSUSAN ...Billy, your family is fine. Senator Buckley just made a special plea on your behalf in the Senate. Newsday has written several big articles about you.  They've called you a pawn in the poppy game between Nixon and the Turks. The letters are coming in, Billy. People care.... \nStops, shakes her head. It sounds all wrong in this context. \nBILLY is still staring at her breasts. He hasn't seen a woman for five years and now a hungry animal look comes into his eyes He moves suddenly pressing up against the glass, rabid.  And in Turkish: \nBILLY (in Turkish) Take it off. Take it off! (then remembering the English) Take it off. Take it off! \nHis voice is savage, demanding. \nSUSAN understands, startled. Looks around. \nSUSAN Billy - you'll just make yourself crazy. \nBILLY \nBILLY Take it off! Take it off! (suddenly in a very soft voice) ...S'il vous plait?... \nA strange look in his eye. \nSUSAN slowly, scared, begins to unbutton her shirt. \nHAMIDOU looks on silently, does nothing. \nBILLY follows every movement with wild-eyed lust. \nSUSAN leans up close to the window.  With both hands on the front of her blouse, she slowly draws it apart. \nBILLY going wild! Against the window. His hand down in his pyjamas. \nHER BREASTS spring free, quivering, full and ripe with a deep cleavage and hard dark nipples. They hang full and loose.  FULL SCREEN \nBILLY'S EYES - FULL SCREEN. \nBILLY beats on the window, working his mouth soundlessly. \nSUSAN is shattered, scared of Billy's sanity. \nSUSAN Oh Billy, Billy, I wish I could make it better for you. Please don't...  don't... \nTears. Fear. \nBILLY tightens dramatically and comes right in his pants, slumps against the window. \nSUSAN realizes he has come, surprised. \nBILLY looks at her. Furtive, animal shame. And suddenly he starts to cry. A flood of feelings locked up too long come pouring out. He murmurs some words, Turkish SOUNDS sputtering out in his throat, then: \nBILLY S.... Susan? \nSoftly, working his mouth finding it hard to speak. \nSUSAN yearning. Tears sprinkling her eyes. \nSUSAN Yes, Billy? \nBILLY straining, not out of physical weakness but an emotional one. Sputters, eyes closed. \nBILLY ...I love you.... \nIt sounds pathetic, lost. \n", "test3_id": 2}

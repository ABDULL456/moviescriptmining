{"train": "VARIOUS PASSENGERS What's he saying?  I don't know... Marian.  Hey Marian, what the hell... \nThe Turkish-speaking PASSENGERS are gathering together their items and beginning to exit as: \nPOLICE OFFICER repeats, in ENGLISH \nPOLICE OFFICER Idem. \nCLOSE BILLY. The POLICE OFFICER is only beginning the speech.in English but already Billy realizes, And it's panic.  Silent panic. That horrendous cold feeling all over his back: Oh God what have I done, what can I do now? He freezes. \nMOVE TO SUSAN rising, fetching her things, irritated. \nSUSAN Jesus, they do everything ass backwards in Turkey. \nBehind her we see the other AMERICAN PASSENGERS beginning to disembark with the usual chorus of overlapped conversations, expletives, including: \nPASSENGERS They're checking for hijackers. Any Palestinians aboard? Hey Harry, get rid of your grenades... \nLaughter is returned from several of the American contingent, but we MOVE BACK to BILLY in foreground; all of a sudden he is on his knees trying to crawl under the seat. \nSUSAN (OFF) Billy, what's the matter? \nBILLY My passport! \nSUSAN No! \nShe bends down to look, coming FACE TO FACE with him. He grips her arm. \nBILLY (low voice) Susan - forget it. Go get us a seat on the plane. Now. \nSUSAN (picking up the real fear in his voice) What is it? . . . Billy? \nBILLY (a fierce whisper, panic) For Christ's sake, just GET on the plane, okay! \nHis tone stuns her; never before has he spoken to her like that.  A LOOK between them; he has his glasses off now. She's not a stupid girl by any means and realizes something is very wrong and for the both of them, she'd best do exactly as he says. And fast.  She moves OUT OF SHOT. \nBILLY, crouched low in the aisle starts to work fast, his finger: shaking reaching into his sweater starting to work the TAPE loose from around his chest; looking from under the bench. Still quite a bit of commotion as passengers are exiting. BUT THEN: \nBILLY P.O.V. - UNIFORMED LEGS coming slowly down Isle Towards him. The muzzle of An M-l RIFLE tapping loosely Against the side of the kneecap. \nPAN WITH and MOVE UP as TURKISH MILITARY LIEUTENANT comes into view, intersecting outgoing PASSENGERS, eyes casually coming to rest on: \nBILLY looks up from his kneeling position on floor; his sweater rolled back down; he indicates the passport in his hand. \"Just found it\" expression. \nMOVE to the LIEUTENANT not necessarily suspecting anything, but with a customary insolence reserved for young vagrant- types, he stretches his rifle arms length with one hand and gently prods Billy up with the tip of the muzzle placed under his chin. MOVE BACK to the OFFICER, bringing the rifle back to his side, indicating Billy get off the bus with the others. All in silence. \nCUT: \nBILLY among a group of MALE PASSENGERS funnelling into two lines that pass on either side of a wooden inspection table. Thirty TURKISH SOLDIERS with rifles ring the area. It is open, vast, no place to run or hide. The only apparent hope is to melt into their regular jostling patterns of the passengers impatiently waiting. \nTWO PLAINCLOTHESMEN (Police) are on each side of the table, body-searching the male passengers alternately. \nSUSAN is in a similar set-up twenty yards away, with FEMALE ATTENDANTS doing the searching. She glances at Billy as she undergoes search. She is cleared, passes on, towards the ramp of the plane. \nBILLY, his sunglasses off, smoothly melts among the male PASSENGERS pulling some books from his shoulder bag.  Glides to the head of the line. MOVE TO: \nThe FIRST OFFICER patting down a PASSENGER, his back partially turned to Billy. MOVE AROUND bringing him into foreground as: \nBILLY skirts him in the background, camouflaged among two other conversing PASSENGERS waiting for the SECOND OFFICER who now appears in foreground on the lateral TRACK; he is busy with another passenger. In passing him, Billy replaces the books in his shoulder bag as though he had already been searched by the first officer, \nTension. FOLLOW BILLY as he approaches the boarding ramp. \nBILLY P.O.V. - SUSAN at the top of the ramp waiting. Smiling STEWARDESSES. Pan America. Haven. \nBILLY - FOOT rising off Turkish soil onto ramp. \nTURKISH HAND lightly touching Billy's elbow, then grasping the ARM. \nTURK (OFF) Just a minute! \nBILLY his eyes flattening. \nSUSAN in LONG SHOT, reacting. \nBILLY turns trying to seem casual; he confronts the SECOND OFFICER face to face and gestures towards the: \nFIRST OFFICER who happens to glance at them. \nSECOND Nebu? Did you search him? \nFIRST OFFICER (frowns) No! \nSECOND OFFICER tightens his grip on BILLY, angry, and pulls him back to the TABLE. MOVE with them. The officer has been lied to; in addition he is young, inexperienced, about eighteen. \nSECOND OFFICER (grunts a command, makes a gesture) \nBILLY, comprehending, spreads his arms.  The OFFICER pats him down carefully, brushing against his armpits. Precisely in the area where we saw the hashish. But incredibly he doesn't notice, continuing to work his way down the hips and legs. \nTex glances at him, questioningly. \nBILLY She didn't know anything about...I wouldn't have wanted her to. \nTEX Lucky girl. \nBilly leans back in seat, blowing out the cigarette smoke. \nBILLY Jeez, she used to say I was the lucky one. \nTEX Let's hope so, Billy.  Let's sure hope so. \nA narrow cobblestone STREET.  TEX pulls the car to a halt. \nCUT: \nTHE PUDDING SHOPPE TWILIGHT Internationally-known cafe, adjacent BAZAAR. Crowded, noisy. WOMEN dressed in black hold crying CHILDREN by the hands. FOREIGNERS, mostly students and hippies, move about laughing, joking. Hawkers, street peddlers, vendors cooking shishkebab.  small GYPSY BOY leads a huge MUZZLED BEAR on a leash. \nBILLY sits at a small outdoor TABLE alone sipping tea and eating baclava - nervous, very nervous, still trying to sort it all out in his head. If he doesn't find the seller, what will happen next? \nMOVE across the TABLES, past a middle-aged AMERICAN COUPLE, to TWO TURKISH PLAINCLOTHESMEN watching him closely. They look evident. TWO HIPPIES make a wide berth around them. \nHIPPIES (OFF) (in passing, low) Hey Janet, why don't you go sell 'em some dope. \nMOVE ON to another TABLE where TWO MORE PLAINCLOTHESMEN sit, equally evident, watching BILLY. \nTEX sits in his car, in the distance, casually glancing at a newspaper. \nBILLY's eyes rove. \nINTERIOR PUDDING SHOPPE Large. Many tables. Stairs. A back exit. \nANOTHER GYPSY BOY leads a huge PINK PIG leashed with a wooden sign around its neck proclaiming \"Pig\" in Turkish. Various TURKS point the pig out, laughing at it, some disgusted by it, making faces and gestures: \"Go way, go way!  \"Ayip!\"  The PIG moves past BILLY, who shifts his gaze to: \nPOV - CABDRIVER #1 lingering at the curb. PAN to CABDRIVER #2  PAN to CABDRIVER #3. PAN BACK to #1 and again to #2 indicating no real fix on identity. \nBILLY tense now, knowing this is the chance he must take, nods with his head, pointing at CABDRIVER #2, off. \nTHE PLAINCLOTHESMEN move out towards CABDRIVER #2. \nBILLY tentatively rises, as if to join them, but moves slyly towards the interior of the cafe. \nPLAINCLOTHESMEN move in roughly on a surprised CABDRIVER #2 who begins to protest LOUDLY (AD LIB). \nBILLY moves through the INTERIOR of the PUDDING SHOPPE, past the tables, past the stairs, towards the back of the shop, at a normal.to attract attention. \nA PLAINCLOTHESMAN looks around, sees he is gone. Tells the others (AD LIB) They spread out looking, abandoning the CABDRIVER #2 who spits and curses them (AD LIB). \nBILLY, with one backward glance, now eases out the BACK DOOR, into a bilious sunlight, onto a STREET. Pause. \nA HAND with GUN moves into FRAME pointing a six-inch barrel right at his temple.  BILLY freezes, moving just his eyes to: \nTEX looking down at him calm, merciless. \nTEX You seem like a nice enough kid to me Billy, but try it and I'll blow your fucking brains out. \nBILLY - the sense of betrayal in his eyes. \nESTABLISH PRISON - OVERHEAD ANGLE. A large and Byzantine structure suggesting the 15th Century Sultan's Janissary Barracks. Irregular crescent various wings; a MOSQUE inside the prison. The possibly a shapes to the sense of an endless a decorative an equally in a city, labyrinth built by some mad Arab architect to suit purpose and now, in the 20th Century, transformed by mad Turkish bureaucracy into a prison. It should be preferably made to look like Istanbul. \nFaint background atonal Turkish CHANTING. Evening Muslim prayer.\"Allah wakbah, Allah wakbah...\" on and on, suggesting to us fear rather than praise. \nBILLY VOICE Dear Mom and Dad. This is the hardest letter I've ever had to write. know the confusion and the pain it will cause you.  And the disappointment... \nBILLY - his scalp being shaved off by a prison BARBER in an un-specified ANTI-CHAMBER, His eyes are staring dead ahead. \nBILLY VOICE (continuous) I really thought knew what I was doing with my life. I'd hoped somehow to get out of this quickly so that you'd never know about it. But that just isn't possible now. I don't know what's going to happen. But what can I say to you?  Will 'I'm sorry' make a difference? Will it ease the pain, the shame you must be feeling?  Forgive me...Please... \nBILLY is now completely BALD, SOUND SHARP OVER: \nCUT: \nA CELL DOOR SLIDING OPEN. BILLY steps in, bewildered. \nZIAT VOICE (OFF) Git! \nThe cell is dark, almost black, an overpowering stench; a small grey metal bunk is bolted to the floor with a lumpy mattress. BILLY turns, looking back at the man staring at him from the door. \nZIAT is quickly summing up Billy's character. This is his craft.He is a prisoner and trustee. sinister man whose one motivation in life is the accumulation of money, in the pursuit of which he has acquired an ugly purplish SCAR running the width of his throat, various other facial SCARS; and one blind milky white EYE. He's stocky and strong -- about five ten, with bushy eyebrows, brown cigarette teeth, big dirty nails, repulsively in need of a bath. What's surprising is that he is no more than thirty years old looks and behaves like sixty. The personification of the denaturalization of a man. Time, body, mind - all of them warped. \nBILLY, not yet attuned to his nature, only repulsed, is still wearing his own clothes and makes a shivering gesture, enunciating very clearly, hoping he will understand. \nBILLY Cold. Very cold. Can I get blanket? Blanket? (makes a gesture of a blanket wrapped around him) \nZIAT smiles, showing his stained teeth, and starts to slide shut the cell door on its ROLLER. \nZIAT (in English) Mo sell...Too late.  Tomorrow... \nRaises the club. \nBILLY tries to block it with his hand, and the CLUB smashes his thumb.  SCREAM. \nSHARP CUT: \nBILLY is hoisted upside-down in his UNDERPANTS ONLY with thick rope tied about his ankles, the legs spread - onto a PULLEY suspended from the ceiling. He is yanked upwards, then lowered slightly, his head and backs of shoulders banging against the stone floor. \nTHE PULLEY is LOCKED into place.  (LOUD SOUND) \nBILLY has this surprised look on his face still, through the tears.  What's happening? \nHamidou motions the GUARDS out of the room (AD LIB).  Turns back to BILLY, raises his club. \nBRINGS IT DOWN FORCE on the soles of BILLY'S BARE FEET. SCREAM.  He cocks the club again. \nBILLY twists To avoid The blow \nCLUB catches him On The ANKLEBONE \nBILLY SCREAMs louder than ever as we hear The SOUND of wood On bone.  Whimpering SOUNDS follow. \nBILLY looking through teary eyes, sure now that he is going to be killed. The CLUB - OFF - smacks sole skin with the same force as the first blow. No let up. \nCUT: \nBILLY still in the same position, vomits all over himself. \nHAMIDOU SPINS the PULLEY to a new position bringing: \nBILLY into a steeper, more vertical position.  He is on the verge of fainting, bleary-eyed, looking as: \nHAMIDOU moves around in between his legs. Doing something indistinct with the stick between his legs, then dropping the stick. Then, with this bizarrely excited expression on his hairless face, he begins to undo his own pants. But, for Billy, it all BLURS OUT TO: \nJAPANESE SILK SCREEN depicting a fat jovial Buddhist monk, fishing placidly by a stream. Then moves to soap carvings of chess pieces Then a bed-sheet hung as a curtain with astrological symbols paint; on it.  SOUND OFF, of a blaring radio.  Atonal TURKISH MUSIC. \nVOICE (close, intense) Hey man, he's gotta walk, or his feet gonna swell up worse. \n2ND VOICE (softer, sonorous, Swedish accent) We take him down to courtyard... \nThen: ERICH - a gentle long bird's face. Long whitish-blond- hair, Swedish, well above six feet, 25. \nAnother FACE moves into view JIMMY BELL, American, 23 fiery eyes, black hair and moustache, intense, strong. \nBELL Smoke this rocket, it'll cool the pain. \nANOTHER ANGLE - BELL puts a huge cone-shaped JOINT with aluminium foil filter into BILLY'S LIPS. He hardly knows what it is, Puffing weakly. Though dehydrated and his face white without color, he has no facial markings. \nBELL You gotta walk around some man, or your feet gonna swell up something bad... \nBILLY looks down at \nHIS FEET Bloated black and blue with inflamed red points in various spots. A vicious bruise on his anklebone. ERICH is running a cold rag from a basin of water over them, his fingers tender. \nBELL (OVER) You've been out for days man, talking all kinds of shit. Come on, we'll walk you down to the courtyard. \nBELL eases BILLY up from the bed, as ERICH puts a pair of clip-clops on his feet. \nERICH Okay? \nBILLY nods. They rise together, bracing his shoulder. BILLY adjusting to the sensation of standing. \nERICH How's it feel? \nBILLY (dizzy) About as good as it looks. \nBELL Getchmis olsun \nBILLY Getchmis...? \nBELL Olsun - \"May it pass quickly.\" I'm Bell, Jimmy Bell. This is Erich something Swedish. \nERICH (smiling) Just Erich. \nBILLY I'm Billy Hayes... At least I used to be. \nLooks around. \nA DORMITORY TYPE ROOM with 24 bunk beds set head to head in horizontal fashion, cramped and with minimal privacy. A narrow WALKWAY leading towards a TOILET AREA and STAIRCASE. \nBILLY Looks like a cheap hotel. \nBELL Yeah... Only the room service is lousy.  Come on, let me show you the tennis courts. \nHelps him with ERICH to take the first steps. \nTHE COURTYARD. The THREE of them emerge in a thin AFTERNOON sun, Billy now disengaging and hobbling on his own power. \nERICH New people sometimes get on his nerves. \nBILLY (lifeless) What did he do? \nERIC He was caught steeling from a Mosque.  That's heavy here.  He got 30 years. \nBILLY Thirty years? \nERICH Jimmy has more balls than brains. He didn't tell his parents he was in jail for a year and a half.  He says he got himself in and now he's going to get himself out. \nHe shakes his head, looking at: \nBELL him across the courtyard huddling with a cigarette, bartering angrily. a raggedy GUARD giving him a cigarette, bartering angrily. \nBILLY and ERICH. \nBILLY And you? \nERICH Hashish.  Ninety percent of the foreigners are in for hashish. \nThey walk. \nBILLY What they give you? \nERICH (passive) Twelve years. \nBilly stops. \nBILLY How much did you have? \nERICH A hundred grams. \nBILLY (appalled) It's not fair! \nEven ERICH has to smile now. \nERICH There is no fair in Turkey, Billy. It's all \"sula-bula\" like this, like that. An Italian hippie had a car accident and a Turk was killed. SO, they threw him in here for six months... \nBILLY That doesn't seem so bad. \nERICH But he was eating lunch a mile away when the Turk smashed into killed himself. \nBILLY He wasn't even in the car? \nERICH (shakes his head) Aslan, there... (points) \nASLAN - a young big fat heavily moustached Turk, wearing a black silk double-breasted business suit, grotesque cuff- links, heavily pomaded hair, is huddling in a section of the YARD with FIVE other grinning GANGSTER TYPES, all in suits. \nERICH (OVER) Killed a guy. But his father's a big gangster on the docks.  A \"Kapidiye.\"  He'll stay in... twelve months no more, and get parole. In Turkey, murder is manly - \"erkek\". \nERICH Glances back at BILLY \nERICH You just got to get yourself a good lawyer.  And some money... Talk to Max.  He's been in the longest. \nBILLY How long? \nERICH Seven years... \nCUT: \nMAX - \"Eskilet\" (skeleton). British, tall, straggly long hair with wire spectacles set crookedly over his nose. An earing in one ear. The far away eyes of an international junkie, preoccupied and uninterested in small talk. Tough in his skinny way, like apiece of old dried leather. \nHe occupies with his YOUNG STRIPED CAT a bunk in the far corner of the SECOND FLOOR KOGUS - in the process of shooting himself up with \"Gastro\" a smelly brown liquid stomach medicine.  No one is in the vicinity except \nANOTHER ANGLE \nERICH and BILLY who watches repelled as MAX fumbles with a piece of twine tied around his arm in a tourniquet, searching for an unused spot amid dirty infected track marks. PLUNGES the needle in, pumping in the black gunk. Glances at BILLY. \nMAX (smiles) Gastro.  Stomach medicine. Has codeine in it... Best can do \nPulls out the needle, loosens the tourniquet. His eyes take on a far away stare. \nERICH Lawyers? \nMAX Yeah... there's no straight lawyers in Turkey... They're all bent bent as hairpins... \nGives a spoon with a taste of the black residue to: \nHIS CAT who is full of spunk, and tries to catch Max's HAND. \nHe looks at BILLY, not remembering him. \nERICH His name? \nMAX Who? \nERICH The lawyer? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nFATHER Don't worry about it.  Right now money doesn't count. Okay? \nA pause. YESIL Shifts, Throats are cleared. BILLY moves to sit down, limping faintly; he is wearing sneakers and the bruises don't show. \nFATHER Where'd you get that limp? \nBILLY (not wanting to alarm him) Nothing. Just twisted my ankle. \nSits down at the conference TABLE. \nBILLY Where you staying, Dad? \nFATHER (pulls up a seat next to Billy) The Hilton. \nBILLY How do you like it?  Istanbul? \nFATHER Well, it's an interesting place... (lowers his voice, a hint of a smile) Tell you the truth, I think the food is lousy. The crap they sell in these little restaurants. I went out to eat in one of them last night, and I had to run to the damn toilet... You shoulda' seen the toilet. \nBILLY laughs. \nBILLY You mean you got toilets? \nFATHER is happy to see his son laugh. \nFATHER Yeah, with real toilet paper - and you don't have to use both sides. \nBILLY laughs again. \nFATHER So now I'm eating at the Hilton every night. \nBILLY smiles. A pause. A worried look returns to the Father's face \nFATHER Why'd you do it, Billy? \nBILLY For the money... (Looks away)) \nFATHER (sighs) I know you kids smoke that stuff, and we drink booze, but taking it across a border - it was stupid, Billy. Stupid. \nBILLY I know. \nGlances at DAVIS, YESIL back to his father, his voice beginning to tremble, ashamed of himself for letting it show. \nBILLY Dad get me out of here. \nANOTHER ANGLE. The FATHER understands the desperation in his voice, puts his hand on his son's. \nFATHER I promise you, Billy. Just sit tight and don't.. DON'T do anything stupid.  Let me work with Mr. Yesil and Mr. Davis.  We'll get you out... Okay?  Billy, okay? \nAll the assurance of the world is written in this kindly Irishman's face. \nBILLY feels it. \nBILLY being led by TWO GUARDS down a huge arched CORRIDOR in the COURTROOM BUILDING. \nBILLY Okay. \nCUT: \nPROSECUTOR VOICE (OVER) THE world is now looking at Turkey. We are called the Heroin Supplier of the world.  Stories about us are in newspapers and on television every day all around the world. The time has come, your Honor, to alter this image before we find ourselves isolated and morally ostracized by the rest of the human race... \nTHE COURTROOM - monolithic, frightening, immense with cross- currents of greenish light from the enormous windows. People seem insignificant. \nTHE PROSECUTOR, wearing dark green glasses, continues, scowling, gesturing profusely at: \nBILLY in the PRISONERS DOCK, baroque design, isolated. Doesn't understand a thing, Erich's extra-large blue pin- striped suit makes him look rather absurd. \nHIS FATHER, CONSUL DAVIS, YESIL and ANOTHER LAWYER are seated together at the defence table conferring in low tones with each other. YESIL looks over at BILLY with a big reassuring grin, nods his head - nothing to worry about. \nTURKISH GIRL from the Press with a yellow legal pad, makes notes in the Spectator Gallery. Her legs flare out from a short skirt. \nBILLY pries his eyes away to: \nPROSECUTOR continuing in front of the THREE JUDGES high on an Alice in Wonderland podium wearing long black robes with scarlet collars. One of the Judges is bald, the other has his eyes closed, could be asleep. The CHIEF JUDGE in the middle has a sagging somewhat kindly face and short grey hair.  A YOUNG MAN below the podium, is clacking at an ancient typewriter on a small table. \nPROSECUTOR VOICE (OVER) (continuous) ...We must alter this image by punishing only our own drug smugglers-but by handing out foreigners who infest our culture with their depravity ungodly and behavior.  We must start now - by sentencing this American, Vilyum Hi-yes, to the maximum sentence for smuggling, to be held up to the light of the world as an example of Turkish justice and its intention to halt the drug trade once and for all.. .I ask the Court therefore to sentence Vilyum Hi-yes to Life Imprisonment. \nHe sits, staring malignantly at BILLY. \nTHE JUDGES rise. \nJUDGE Thank you, Prosecutor. The Court will now recess to consider its verdict. \nThe JUDGES exit. \nANOTHER ANGLE, General commotion in the courtroom as people move about. The FATHER and DAVIS and the OTHER LAWYER consult among themselves, the FATHER vigorously nodding his head.  YESIL approaches BILLY. \nIt sputters out of his mouth, senseless to: \nHAMIDOU who closes the door. He has an angry glint in his eye. \nCUT: \nBILLY lies on his bunk at night deeply depressed, paler. Candlelight flutters softly against the stone walls. A PHOTO of SUSAN taken outdoors with a mountain range in the background, is on his wall with various SOAP CARVINGS of little chess piece she has designed. \nIn the distance, very faintly coming upwards into our sound consciousness we hear a TRAIN WHISTLING in the night, on an old railroad track bypassing the prison walls. Two whistles.  Chugging. Then passing off. The Midnight Express. \nBILLY'S VOICE Dear Susan.  1970 has now passed into 1971.  You can drift in here and never know you're gone. You can fade so far out and you don't know where you are anymore or where anything else is... \nThe CAMERA DRIFTS around the SECOND STORY KOGUS revealing the sleepers: ERICH, BELL, MAX... \nBILLY'S VOICE (continuous) I find loneliness is a physical pain which hurts all over; you can't isolate it in one part of your body. I so much need your softness, your strength. I have your letters. They charge me, give me courage.News about amnesty and getting out - tangled, complicated... \nThe CAMERA LINGERS on ZIAT in a far corner of the Kogus, top bunk, against a wall.  Never secure, he shuffles in his sleep. \nVOICE ...I feel myself drifting more heavily into smoking hashish. The haze helps the time pass. Also I do soap carvings.  Erich taught me. And I have been learning Turkish because it helps me to deal with the guards and the prisoners. I'm trying hard to maintain some sort of schedule to my life, but sometimes it seems like I'm just trying in order to try... \nZIAT is evidently awake he pulls his RADIO over into the bed, and peering around to make sure no one is watching, here moves the screws from the back of it, pulls off the cover and puts in a sheaf of large denomination GERMAN MARKS: inside we briefly glimpse a wad of different-colored CURRENCIES stacked with rubber bands. \nCUT: \nCOURTYARD. Volleyball game in progress. ERICH is tall and plays with dexterous grace. BILLY is fast, agile. BELL is muscular, intense, his hits power-packed. \nBILLY'S VOICE (continuous) ... In the daytimes we sometimes play volleyball against the big Turkish gangsters... \nTHE THREE they play against are hilarious looking in this context, moving like big clumsy bears, waving their arms and screaming at each other, disorganized. Ever conscious of fashion, they have their jackets and vests off but play in their Elvis Presley shirts rolled up at the sleeves, shiny slacks, black pointed pumps. The boys wear shorts and sneakers. On the sidelines we see a group of PRISONERS laying bets and shouting encouragement. \nBILLY leaps up for a ball close to the net and as the TURKISH OPPONENT backs off, he dinks the ball in just over the net; the Turk SCREAMS his teammates scream at him. \nCUT: \nBELL goes up for another ball close to the net and really SMASHES it with all his might, and: \nBALL bangs right into the eye of a TURK who flails his arms and SCREAMS with pain, very theatrical. \nCUT: \nTHE SAME TURK now swaggers around the COURTYARD, wearing sunglasses so no one will see his black eye. \nBILLY'S VOICE ...To the Turks all foreigners are \"ayip\" - unclean, dirty. We don't shave our under-arms or around our crotch... \nBELL across the pointyard grins at him and points him out to BILLY, and ERICH. \nBILLY VOICE (continuous) Even the yoga I sometimes do is \"ayip\" - too suggestive... \nTHE TURK scowls back at BELL, huddles menacingly with another TURK. \nBILLY'S VOICE (continuous) And you're never supposed to eat with your left hand. You know why? Because that's what they use to wipe their asses with instead of toilet paper.  And yet they hate pigs. There are no pigs in Turkey. They're considered dirty... \nBELL, smirking at the Turk, turns and walks away. \nBILLY VOICE (continuous) So is homosexuality. That's a big crime here but most of them do it every chance they get.  There are about a thousand things that are \"ayip\".  But they're really so hypocritical, like children breaking the rules. For instance... \nSuddenly a CRY OFF and: \nTHE TURK runs up, pulling a sharp SHIV from his pants, and using the cloth as a handle he repeatedly STABS BELL in the ass and backs of his thighs. One, two, three, four, five QUICK STABS, like a cook hammering veal. In spite of its violence, the action seems like slapstick. \nBELL tumbles to the ground, crying out. \nTHE TURK stashes the shiv and disappears among his FRIENDS, his honor restored. \nBILLY and ERICH run over to help BELL who is obviously more in pain than in danger. \nBILLY VOICE (continuous) ...You can stab or shoot some body the but not above the waist because that's intent to kill. So everybody runs around stabbing everyone else in the ass.  That's what they call 'Turkish revenge'.  There's also a lot of \"Baksheesh\" that's a favorite Turkish word for bribery... \nLONG SHOT - HAMIDOU and ASLAN the young fat Turkish gangster pointed out previously by Erich, are taking tea together in the FIRST STORY KOGUS alone except for ZIATR and Hamidou's two FAT SONS, 7 and 8 years old, both dressed in little suits listening politely as Hamidou gestures to them, in couched terms. The voices are distant and, after a few beats, UNDER BILLY'S VOICE: \nHAMIDOU Unfortunately my youngest son Arief is having problems with his teeth; he needs braces, but dentists are so expensive these days \nASLAN (patting Arief on the head) Poor kid... You know I have a friend, a very good friend; he's a dentist; maybe he could get you some braces at a... reasonable price. \nHAMIDOU (protesting with his hands, shaking his head)) Oh, no...it's out of the question...wouldn't want to ask your friend... \nASLAN Yes. Please! As a favour... I insist \nThey go on, each protesting. \nBILLY VOICE (continuous) Hamidou hints that he needs new braces for one of his sons.  Aslan of course has a friend who's a dentist.  They bullshit for half an hour and Hamidou finally accepts the \"Baksheesh\" in return... \nA BURLAP BAG comes flying over the WALL of the COURTYARD late at NIGHT. Then another comes over, lands in the yard. one is around. \nBILLY VOICE (continuous) Dope and all kinds of shipments get delivered to Aslan, who re- sells it through his runners. People like Ziat.  But one night, it backfired... \nA THIRD BAG comes over, gets caught on a hooknail and rips right open. HUNDREDS of yellow PILLS spill out. \nMAX Ten dollars for this shit?  You greedy one-eyed git. \nZIAT NO!   Is good! (gets his English wrong) Me good shit. (Meaning my shit is good) \nMAX No!  You big shit! \nZIAT thinking MAX is correcting his English, nods and repeats: \nZIAT Yeah! Efe big shit. \nBILLY and MAX snigger and ZIAT realizes they are making fun of him.  He hates that and suddenly reaches over and: \nZIAT JAAAASH! \nSHAKES THE CAT hard off his bunk. A SQUEAL from the cat. \nMAX surprised, glares at Ziat. \nMAX You asshole! \nThen hurries after it, calling its name... \nMAX Hikmet come here boy.  Hikmet \nZIAT shrugs. So what? \nBILLY (irritated) What is it with you man, what the hell is it? \nZIAT Cat, ah!  Ayip! \nBILLY You're ayip! \nZIAT (glares at him, then lets it go) Look, you don't fuck with me, I don't fuck with you, right? \nBILLY But you fuck with me. You fuck with me all the time. You make crummy tea.  You rip us off on the hash. \nZIAT (amused) I make special tea for you, Hiyes, okay?  We've to live like brothers. We have to be in here together. \nBILLY (tired of it) Oh shove it, Ziat for all the money you have, you have nothing! \nZIAT grins, shrugs, squats and fiddles with his keys and footlocker. \nZIAT You 'Merican.  You don't know. \nBILLY watches, repulsed and fascinated. \nBILLY Know what? \nZIAT Was.. (makes gesture with his fingers) ...seven years old. I was on street in Suk.  Buy.  Sell.  No family to take care. I learn. \nBILLY Learn what? \nZIAT shrugs. He thinks BILLY is an idiot. \nZIAT Dog eat dog, Hi-yes. You fuck other man before he fuck you. (grins) And you must fuck last. \nBILLY That's a great philosophy. \nZIAT (shakes his head) You 'Merican.  You don't know. \nMAX has followed his cat down to the end of the floor but it has run up into a rafter which he cannot reach. He calls up. \nMAX Here Hikmet!  Come down here boy! Hikmet... \nRAFTER Nothing. \nMax gives up. \nMAX Sodding cat! \nHe shuffles off back to his bunk. \nTHE CAT is back on ZIAT'S BUNK - NIGHT scratching with his paw around the radio. of the neck, hard. Suddenly he is GRABBED by the scruff  of the neck, hard. \nCUT: \nBILLY jerks up from his bunk as he the hears a loud, piercing SCREECH, OFF, echoing through the Kogus.  Then silence. \nCUT: \nZIAT, industrious as always, is preparing his tea on the three burners of the small bottled gas' stove in THE KITCHEN, FIRST FLOOR Kogus; needless to say the area is filthy with scraps all over the floor, cats and two large wooden eating tables occupied by some PRISONERS. The Kitchen opens up in background into a WASHING ROOM with SINK. It is EARLY MORNING - Muslim CHANTING OFF, \nTHREE TURKISH PRISONERS walk in, talking (AD LIB), followed by MAX stoned, who shuffles over to the table, about to sit, sees something. \nHIS CAT, dead stabbed, and lying there neglected in the corner, just another scrap ready to be swept out. \nZIAT calmly pours the tea for the table, paying MAX no attention, an excellent actor. Prominently seated, however, is a GUARD. \nMAX I don' t know. It's someplace down in there.... (points at the ground) ..deep.. A big door...a wheel.... \nHis eyes go back in time, haunted, vague breaks off. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nBELL (low-keyed) Hey, you know what's gonna get us out of here?  It's not a map, Max. It's our balls. You know what I mean... (straight at Max, Billy, very sincere, his eyes almost watering) ...I gotta get laid man, I don't know 'bout you guys, but if I don't get it on soon, I'm... I'm not gonna make it. \nMAX (under his breath) Shit. \nBELL Billy? \nBILLY ...The roof sounds better to me than digging through a wall.  Ziat's round there all the time. But the roof.... (looks up) \nP.O.V. - THE ROOF, its edges visible over the courtyard. \nBILLY shakes his head. \nBILLY The bullet percentage is awful high. \nA pause. BILLY looks away from BELL'S stare. \nBILLY If I get caught, Jimmy, I'm facing another months. I'd be back up to 3 years, maybe more... \nLooks down. \nBELL understands, deeply disappointed. \nBELL Well fuck it!  Choose your own death, babe, I'm taking the roof out of here! \nBell leaves: \nCUT: \nA LONG DUNGEON CORRIDOR at the end of it, the frame of a small; DOOR, cracks of light at its edges. TRACK IN - F.X. of a siren, capture and now BEATING - heavy beating from behind that door.  CLOSER we reach it. The door FLIES OPEN and HAMIDOU is glimpsed lighting a cigarette. Like a surreal dream, his hand holding the match has a thick LEATHER THONG bound around its knuckles and blood speckled on his fingers. \nA BLUR of foreground movement a GUARD coming out the door - dragging: \nBELL by the hair across the floor. His face contorting in agony. \nBILLY'S VOICE Dear Susan. Poor Jimmy was caught and beaten so badly he got a severe hernia and lost a testicle. He's been in the hospital for months having operations.. \nCUT: \nCLOSE BILLY'S TOOTH BEING PULLED \nBILLY VOICE (continuous) ...In comparison my problems seem very small. But two and a half years have now gone by, and in their own fashion, the Turks are slowly draining my life away... \nWIDEN to a STONE CHAMBER and a crazy looking DENTIST in a filthy long white smock, puffing on a cigarette holder, his ashes falling over Billy as he works his mouth. A motorized drill is plugged into the wall, adjacent a filthy spittoon covered with blood; dried blood is spattered liberally around the chamber. \nBILLY spits out the blood and looks in the mirror. \nBILLY'S VOICE ...I have problems with my stomach and my leg muscles feel very weak. My gums seem to be shrinking and they sometimes bleed when I massage them... They've pulled five of my teeth... \nSuddenly he starts SHOUTING angrily in TURKISH. The DENTIST screams back at him. AD LIB. \nTHE DENTIST still screaming, leans BILLY back in the chair and looks in his mouth. \nBILLY'S VOICE (continuous) ...sometimes they null the wrong one... \nCUT: \nBILLY is washing himself in his undershorts at the SINK with ERICH; the hot water is on full blast and billows of vapor fill the small stone room, like a sauna. He pours a pitcher full of hot water over his head; his eyes lingering on: \nTHE STONES of the wall with their cracked moldings; some areas are noticeably darker than others - Bell's \"wet spots\", the alternate escape route. \nBILLY VOICE (continuos) ...even my dreams don't seem to work any more. Because the outside doesn't seem real any more. It's not even a fantasy...because there is no fantasy. \nERICH uses a coarse washing sponge on BILLY's back. \nBILLY'S VOICE (continuous) Even masturbation has become boring. It teaches you, like the rest of prison life, to seal up your emotions, and this is the greatest danger, this is what makes so many of the men change into something monstrous... \nEYES of the ARABS peer through the musky vapors at Billy and Erich; they loll about the door curious, lecherous for their bodies. \nCUT: \nERICH massaging BILLY on his bunk in the SECOND STORY KOGUS. \nBILLY VOICE (continuous) It is Erich who has taught me how it is to be conscious, to channel and direct my energy.  He has convinced me to stop smoking hashish, he is the calmest man I have ever known.  If you don't control your energy in here if can blow you apart like with Bell. And you can't waste it either.  You have to weigh up every one of your actions - for and against.  Too little sex, too much sex either will throw you off balance... \nERICH leans forward and kisses a tentative BILLY on the lips.  A gentle kiss. They are standing inside the TOILET STALL; lower themselves down onto the seat. ERICH looks back over his shoulder, guarding their privacy. It is late NIGHT. \nBILLY VOICE (continuously) ...he has taught me about feelings, and the need to express them.  And he has taught me about love... \nBILLY closes his eyes, softly - and with hesitation - returns ERICH's caress. Their hands probe each other's bodies. \nBILLY VOICE (continuous) ...and what love really is, beyond its physical forms.. .I think up to now I have only considered my own self, never really another... \nSuddenly he is GRABBED by his ivy-league striped tie and his face is yanked up to the bars, his glasses falling off. \nBILLY is berserk, his face right up against the bars, GRIPPING Davis tight. \nBILLY What do you mean LIFE FOR FOR WHAT! FOR WHAT! \nDAVIS (choking) Billy!  Please! \nCommotion OFF as GUARDS run in, HAMIDOU in the lead. \nBILLY FOR WHAT!  FOR WHAT! \nThe GUARDS try to pry loose BILLY'S strangling grip ON DAVIS' tie. \nBILLY I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT! \nHAMIDOU takes out a KNIFE and cuts the consul's tie in half.  DAVIS falls backwards. \nBILLY is hauled now. back, still gripping half the tie. He is trembling now. \nBILLY I HAVE FIFTY THREE DAYS LEFT! \nDAVIS is shaken. He has red bar marks across his face and is absent-mindedly trying to adjust half a tie as he looks at: \nBILLY being hauled out by HAMIDOU, SCREAMING something indistinct. \nCUT: \nCOURTROOM. Same as before. \nBILLY, in the prisoner's dock, addresses the Court; as he speaks, a Turkish TRANSLATOR. drones underneath his voice level: \nBILLY ...What is the crime?  And what is the punishment?  The answer seems to vary from place to place, and from time to time. What's legal today is suddenly illegal tomorrow cause some society says it's so; and what's illegal yesterday all of a sudden gets legal today because everybody's doing it and you can't throw everybody in jail. Well I'm not saying this is right or wrong. It's just the way things are.... \nYESIL the lawyer; DAVIS the consul. \nTHE PRESS GIRL from the previous trial in the short skirt. \nBILLY \nBILLY (continuous) But I spent the last three and a half years of my life in your prison and I think I paid for my error and if it's your decision today to sentence me to more years, I... I... (a break) You know my lawyers told me 'be cool Billy don't get upset, don't get angry, if you're good I can maybe get a pardon, an amnesty, an appeal, this that and the other thing.' Well that's been going down now for 35 years... \nYESIL looks over, surprised he is talking like this. Looks at DAVIS. \nBILLY. \nBILLY (continuous) And I've been playing it cool and I've been good and now I'm damn tired of being good cause you people gave me the belief that I had 53 days left.  You hung 53 days in front of my eyes and then you took those 53 days away, and Mister Prosecutor!  I just wish you could... \nPROSECUTOR looks over, through his dark green glasses. \nBILLY (OVER) ... stand right here where I'm standing and feel what that... ...feels like, cause then you'd know something you don't know you'd know what means, Mister Prosecutor and you'd know the concept of a society is based on the quality of its mercy means, of its sense of fair play, its sense of justice... but (shrugs and scoffs at himself) I guess that's just like asking a bear to shit in a toilet... \nTRANSLATOR stops, looks puzzled. \nBILLY \nBILLY (same self-mocking tone) For a nation of pigs, it's funny you don't eat them.  Fuck it, give me the sentence. Jesus forgave the bastards, but I can't. I hate you. Nation. I hate your I hate your people. And I fuck your sons and daughters! \nSits down, disgusted; under his breath: \nBILLY ...cause you're all pigs. \nSILENCE in the uncomfortably. courtroom.  PEOPLE looking at each other DAVIS looks down. \nYESIL flips some pages abstractedly. \nTRANSLATOR SCARED: \nTRANSLATOR Would Your honor like me to translate? \nTHE OLD CHIEF JUDGE, the same one as before Shakes his head. \nJUDGE That won't be necessary \nANOTHER ANGLE - THE JUDGE turns to BILLY in the foreground rises, and unexpectedly crosses his wrists out in front of him. \nJUDGE (emotionally) My hands are tied by Ankara! \nMakes the gesture of the hands forcefully, with anger. \nTRANSLATOR (OFF) My hands are tied by Ankara! \nBILLY WATCHING, \nJUDGE (OFF) I must sentence you, Vilyum Hiyes... \nJUDGE \nANOTHER ANGLE - all THREE press their ears to the stone. A silence. The faintest whisper of WIND and dripping 'WATER - indicating a shaft of some nature. BELL looks back at BILLY. \nBELL I told you, I told you you cock- suckers!  You didn't believe me. \nBILLY smiles. MAX reaches over and grabs Bell's face between his hands, kisses him violently. \nMAX Fuck me! You beautiful mother, you! \nCUT: \nMAX now on guard at the STAIRS, looks over at: \nBELL AND BILLY - with fresh paste putting the finishing touches on the edges of the stone which has been replaced in its original position. Bell's half naked torso reveals a pair of dice with lucky sevens tattooed on his shoulder. \nCUT: \nTHE REPLACED STONE. On close inspection, it is apparent that the stucco around it doesn't match the other stones one bit, but as we PULL BACK to see ZIAT washing his tea cups in the SINK during the DAY, this irregularity is lost in the greater mosaic of the wall structure. At least ZIAT doesn't notice as: \nBILLY nervously comes into the SINK area, watching him, and calls to him. \nBILLY (using Turkish) Hey, Ziat, hurry up with the tea will ay! \nZIAT (mutters to himself) Work, work, work, that's all do \nBILLY I don't hear you bitch about the money. \nBILLY followed by ZIAT into the KITCHEN casts a look of relief at: \nBELL and MAX who wait at a table with empty tea cups. \nCUT: \nA HORDE OF COCKROACHES stream out from a crack in the stone as BILLY and MAX dig, scrape, jiggle the third stone. Both covered with sweat, working with confidence now. \nA DARK EMPTY SHAFT on the other side. Dripping water.  Two stones removed. \nBELL runs over: \nBELL Want me to take over? \nBILLY You want to split your hernia again? \nMAX Get off our tits! \nBell turns to go. Suddenly a LOUD CRUMBLING NOISE and: \nA FOURTH STONE starts to go - but brakes itself. \nBILLY, MAX, BELL all framed in a posture of fear -- not daring to move. \nSECOND STORY KOGUS remains silent. \nBELL looks up the STAIRS, tiptoes back, indicating they are clear. \nMAX AND BILLY. All THREE of them look: \nTHE THREE A HALF STONE SPACE. Easily big enough for them to squeeze through. BILLY shines a candle in the shaft, OFF. \nTHE THREE look at each other. The same thought. Eager eyes. The TRAIN WHISTLES by in the night, OFF. \nBELL (sudden) Let's go! \nBILLY looks at his watch, hates to do it. Shakes his head. \nBILLY No. No time. Put 'em back. \nMAX groans to himself. \nCUT: \nBILLY tense and restless at his BUNK TWILIGHT. A loud RADIO OFF - Turkish News. \nBILLY We go early. Any fuck-ups we should be back here and have the stones in by dawn. \nANOTHER ANGLE - MAX, BELL, AND BILLY. A pause. \nBILLY You got your stuff? \nMAX Yeah. \nBELL (persistent) Haps, railroad, bus timetables? \nMAX (business-like) Everything. \nBILLY Okay. (looks around the group) Let's do it. \nHe extends his hands and the other two cross in a six-handed shake. \nBILLY Shit!  Shit!  Shit! \nMAX (slumping to the ground) It's a dead end. The Turks musta' sealed it up. \nBELL What the fuck we gonna do? \nSILENCE as the three pathetic escapees ponder their fate. \nBILLY, getting a grip on himself, thinking. \nBILLY We go back. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nMAX What?  You gotta be joking. \nBILLY (resolute) We go back, seal it up again, and come in tomorrow night - every night 'till we get out of here. There's gotta be a way. Those bats got out someplace. (rises) Now let's go.  Doubletime! \nTakes the THREAD and starts to follow it back. \nCUT: \nTHE SHAFT. BILLY leads the climbers UP. \nMAX reaches a new foothold, stops, getting his breath. Looks down at BELL heavy breathing OFF.  Urging him on. \nMAX You gotta have a lot of balls for this \nBELL, suffering, can't help but grin. \nBELL (murmurs) Count me out. (to himself, shaking his head) Who ever heard of anybody sneaking back into a fucking jail? \nMAX overhearing it. \nMAX Yeah, what if got caught? \nBELL starts to giggle. \nBILLY (OFF) (up the shaft) Hey Max, don't make the dummy laugh. \nMAX laughing, shaking his head. \nMAX (between giggles) Who's laughing?  I mean I find this terribly depressing... Can you see old Hamidou's face when he tries to figure this one out? \nBILLY can't go on, starts to giggle at the thought. \nBILLY (between giggles) We'll tell him we were checking out our escape route.  We wanted to be completely sure before we tried it. \nANOTHER ANGLE - the THREE of them, spaced along the shaft, are all giggling hysterically. Echoing. HOLD ON them. \nCUT: \nBILLY comes through the HOLE in the stones in the SINK AREA.  It is still NIGHT.  He looks around - silence. MAX follows through the hole. \nCUT: \nBILLY and MAX work fractically to seal up the STONES. \nBELL, exhausted, is at the STAIRS guarding. Distant early morning SOUNDS of prison waking up.  We feel they will be spotted this time, but: \nCUT: \nBILLY slumps into his BUNK as the first rays of LIGHT come up in the sky and the CHANT from the Mosque commences.  He immediately sinks into sleep. \nCLOSE on OLD TEA LEAVES being washed in the SINK.  A MILKY WHITE EYE follows into view.  ZIAT is preparing his early morning tea, his good eye now moving to something beyond the tea leaves. Curious, he straightens, throwing the withered bunch of leaves the sink. \nZIAT approaches the irregular stucco paste around the REPLACED STONES; runs his fingers along the ridges, noticing the paste is fresh. \nBILLY snoring from fatigue.  BELL wakes him quickly. \nBELL Billy, wake up!  They found it! \nOFF there is a lot of SHOUTING downstairs. \nBILLY Who? \nBELL Ziat! \nCUT: \nBILLY standing in a group of PRISONERS with BELL and MAX. He has a look of total despair on his face, as he watches. \nTHE SINK.  PRISONERS are everywhere jabbering excitedly among themselves.  ZIAT is conferring with HAMIDOU as GUARDS rip out the last stone, revealing the HOLE leading to the SHAFT. \nBILLY's gaze shifts to ZIAT fixing all his hatred on him. \nZIAT grinning, moves away, and his falaka stick cocked like a sergeant major - moves among the prisoners. \nMAX I want to cut his throat. \nBILLY It's already been cut. \nMAX Then I'll cut his balls off. \nBILLY smiles, shakes his head, then: \nBILLY If you really wanted to hurt Ziat (pause) \nMAX slumps back down on the bunk, suddenly tired of killing. \nBILLY (reflective) ...His money - steal that, you steal his blood... Could you see his face when everything he worked so hard to get got snatched? (plays with the thought idly, then shrugs) If we knew where he hid it. (waves it away) Anyway, steal from him they'd pick up the whole prison and shake it sideways.  We couldn't hide it anywhere. \nMAX (head bobbing now, murmurs) You know where it is? \nBILLY What? \nMAX (a vague grin) I know where it is. \nBILLY glances at him, not sure whether he heard. \nBILLY His money? \nMAX gives him a goofy nod - and a grin. Imitating Robert Newton as Long John Silver. \nMAX 'Dem dat hides can finds says I'... I seen him, the clever tit, sneaking looks at it late at night, talking to it. \nBILLY (beginning to believe him) Yeah? Where? \nMAX, distracted, let's his attention wander back.  Inaudible his head bobbing now. \nMAX Hishradyo. \nBILLY Max - where? \nMAX (his mouth hanging open, eyes closed) His radio Back of his open, radio... \nHe lurches over gently on the bunk. \nMAX That's why he never plays it... \nMAX Sleeps. \nBILLY surprised, then reflective. \nCUT: \nTHE BACK OF THE RADIO is unscrewed; the cover pulled off. EMPTY! \nMOVE TO ZIAT.  The look is as Billy expected. Horror, shock, anger, fear.  ZIAT SCREAMS hysterically like old Greek widow and: \nBEATING HIS CHEST and tearing at his hair, ZIAT runs out of the KOGUS wailing, moaning. \nCUT: \nTHE SECOND STORY KOGUS is being\" controlled\" by the GUARDS. WIDE ANGLE reveals a circus of clockwork destruction as the GUARDS, making abundant NOISE, systematically rip up each bunk, locker, mattress, picture, book, etc., their faces flushed with this opportunity for orgy. \nCUT: \nTHE PRISONERS are lined up in the COURTYARD, each one being body searched.Prominent are MAX and BILLY, looking up amused at the \nSECOND STORY WINDOWS - feathers from a mattress fly around. ZIAT Briefly appears, his face at the window, looking at the prisoners in the yard, frustrated. \nHAMIDOU breaks apart a with his bare hands. \nZIAT is stripping MAX's possessions, sure he will find it here. \nVOICE (OFF) Down here! \nZiat springs up. \nGUARD calling out from the STAIRS. \nGUARD We found it! \nCUT: \nZIAT leaning in CLOSE, OVER THE STOVE in the KITCHEN, framed by GUARDS. It is the same crouched posture he always uses to work the stove but now his eyes show complete despair as he sees: \nA THOUSAND SHREDS OF PAPER MONEY floating in his pots amid his withered tea bags. From ashes to ashes and dust to dust. \nZIAT folds his head into his hands, sobbing then wailing very human, very sad. \nCUT: \nKITCHEN - NEGDIR an Arab, is now running the tea concession. A jolly ebullient man. Pours a cup for MAX. Several OTHERS are at the table. \nHAMIDOU (turns on Billy, in English) You, goddamn you, shut up! (Back to MAX) Take him to the cellar) \nGUARDS drag off. \nMAX Get out of here! He's lying!  That cock-sucker!  Billy...? \nCUT: \nBILLY sits on his his anger building, his imagination running wild. \nCUT: \nMAX being dragged down a CORRIDOR by his feet. A SCREAM. \nBILLY \nCUT: \nBELL, his features distorted, being carried into an AMBULANCE. \nCUT: \nBELL, MAX and BILLY at the wall, digging together, MAX hugging BELL the time they found the shaft. \nCUT: \nMAX twisting out of the grip of a GUARD and, grabbing the glass from his smashed spectacles, he cuts deep into his wrist.  GUARDS grab him. A LOUD LAUGH OFF carrying over. \nBILLY turning on his bunk to see: \nZIAT joking with TWO GUARDS as he enters the SECOND STORY. The guards back down the stairs. \nBILLY already in movement. \nZIAT, in his suit, collecting suitcase from his bunk, preparing to leave. \nVOICE (OFF) ZIAT! \nTurns and catches a FIST in the side of the face.  Staggers into a bunk. \nBILLY, fists clenched, yells a string of Turkish curse words at him: \nBILLY Asina covacim, ipnave pesankek...yosakt. \nLunges. \nZIAT is bulky, throws the smaller BILLY off and scrambles past a bunk. \nBILLY is up and after him. Jumps back as a SHIV cuts the air in front of him. His side is cut. \nZIAT holding the shiv, feints, cursing BILLY in Turkish. \nBILLY skips back, takes a MATTRESS off the bed and runs it right into KNOCKING HIM AND THE WHOLE BUNK OVER. \nTHE TWO scramble around, BILLY tackling him into another BUNK which also goes over. Chairs break. \nZIAT butts his head into BILLY'S jaw. \nBILLY staggers back from the blow and ZIAT jumps him, BITING into his ear. \nZIAT, getting a better hold, now BITES into BILLY'S NOSE. \nBILLY slams ZIAT in the nose hard with the palm of his hand.  ZIAT relinquishes his hold, grabbing at his broken bleeding nose. \nBILLY beats him around the head but though the blood now flows and teeth are broken, is like a clumsy bear, hard to kill. \nZIAT scrambles away on his knees under another BUNK now screaming as loud as he can. \nZIAT HELP ME!  GUARDS!  HELP ME! \nSEVERAL PRISONERS watching from further down the SECOND STORY Kogus now move in sync, turning on their RADIOS loud as possible, drowning out the cries for help, others watching the stairs. \nBILLY takes the BUNK and throws it over, revealing ZIAT cowering in pure terror. He grabs ZIAT by the hair, hauls him up and \nLAUNCHES HIS KNEE into HIS FACE. \nZIAT thuds onto the floor. \nBILLY stomps him in the gut hard. \nZIAT screams unnaturally shrill. \nBILLY, driven by supernatural anger, now jumps on him and CLAMPS HIS MOUTH right on ZIAT'S open SCREAM. \nA STRUGGLING KISS ensues. \nBILLY pulls back, his mouth filled with blood, spitting out. \nTWO ATTENDANTS in smocks indifferently finish eating on a newspaper spread across one of the beds; they shake out the paper. \nCHICKEN BONES, ORANGE PEELS hitting the floor. A flurry of movement, as the LUNATICS scuffle like rats over the left- overs. AD LIB curses, yells. \nAN OLD MAN obscenely gestures to BILLY from his bed. \nOLD MAN Hey American.  Fik!  Fick!  Come. Fik!  Fik! \nHis blackened teeth leer. \nBILLY, seemingly immune to all of this in some private island of his own madness, walks in his determined way past a PARTITION to: \nA CIRCULAR STONE STAIRCASE leading downwards, the stones damp, dark, slippery. BILLY continues with the same straight- ahead determination to: \nA LONER LEVEL. at last BILLY's expression changes to almost childish relief, for here at last is the refuge he seeks the relative comfort and silence of THE WHEEL. \nIt is a grim, squat PILLAR dominating the room and bearing the weight of the ceiling. And around it some SIXTY LUNATICS trudge slowly, near silently, in counter-clockwise flow. It is a hypnotic shuffle and BILLY blends right in, sliding easily into the sluggish, mindless river, his eyes hanging loosely on the floor, watching: \nTHE SOOTHING RHYTHM OF FEET shuffling at a comforting pace. These are the spokes of the wheel. \nCUT: \nTWO TINY BARE LIGHT-BULBS give faint, eerie illumination to the chamber. One one side, a pot-bellied stove flickers, etching the shadows of the walkers in a strange orange glow. \nSOME LUNATICS, not walking, hover around the stove.  OTHERS are jammed onto a low L-shaped wooden platform that runs the length of two walls. of these men are naked, covered with open running sores over their knees, elbows, buttocks. But they are much quieter than the upstairs crowd. They are the lowest order of madmen. They have no minds left. They are the damned. \nBILLY walks among them, expressionless. A tall, thin cadaverous TURK with a grizzled beard now shuffles up alongside BILLY, looks at him, walks with him. is about fifty, his pyjamas relatively clean, looking more sane than the average but his eyes are bright and scary and his wet hair is matted down on his head, and big clumps of it have been pulled out. He speaks with a cultured English accent. \nAHMET You're an American? \nBILLY is interrupted but keeps his eyes on the ground. AHMET doesn't wait for an answer. \nAHMET Ah yes, America!  My name is Ahmet. I studied philosophy at Harvard for many many years. But actually Oxford is my real Alma  Mata - I've also studied in Vienna. Now I study here. \nBILLY doesn't notice, shuffles along. \nAHMET ...They put me here. They say I raped a little boy. I have been here very long time. They will never let me go. \nBILLY pays no attention, keeps shuffling on.  Glances at him, smiles. \nAHMET They won't let YOU go either. \nThe smug certainty of his manner reaches some chord deep inside Billy, because Billy glances briefly at this lunatic who is smiling. Billy looks back at his feet. \nAHMET No, they'll never let you go. They tell you they let you go but you stay. You never go from here. \nBILLY plods on. grins and tries to explain the situation like a father lecturing a child. \nAHMET You see we all come from a factory. Sometimes the factory makes bad machines that don't work. They put them here. The bad machines don't know they're bad machines, but the people at the factory know. They know one of the machines that doesn't work... \nThey walk on.  Ahmet's expression changes. \nAHMET (polite) I think we have spoken enough for today.  I say good night to you. \nHe wraps his rags around himself quite carefully and we FOLLOW him out of the circle. He drops to his hands and knees and with a sense of dignity, crawls into the filthy blackness under the L-shaped wooden platform, disappearing like a cockroach. \nBILLY plods on. \nCUT: \nAN OLD WHITE-BEARDED MADMAN the Hoja, grandiose in his rags, leads MUSLIM PRAYER in the first ROOM. Some of his followers have prayer mats, others a scrap of sheet or newspaper; their tones discordant, still pushing and shoving at each other during the prayer. \nTWO SPASTICS can't follow the routine of kneeling and bending; they tangle up absurdly and fall to the floor in a ball of arms and legs. \nA FALAKA STICK pokes BILLY wake SOUND of the CHANTING fills room. It is evidently impossible to distinguish night from day because there are no windows. \nATTENDANTS poke the LUNATICS awake with their \"clubs. \nATTENDANTS Head count!  Head count! \nCUT: \nA MASS OF LUNATICS in the ROOM all at once.  Attendants take a redundant and comic head count. The place sounds like a \"yadi yadi room\" the noise fearsome. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nATTENDANT #1 Sixty two, sixty three, sixty four.... \nATTENDANT #2 Seventy four, seventy five, seventy six.. .get back there, you! . . . seventy five, seventy six....) \nATTENDANTS poke around underneath a bed and pull out a very old trembling VEGETABLE. \nOTHER ATTENDANTS wrap an old DEAD LUNATIC with no teeth and foam on his open lips into a dirty sheet and haul him away. \nBILLY amid the LUNATICS.  We MOVE closer and closer to him, the head COUNT regressing. The room has become a torture cell - the NOISE LOUDER, LOUDER, closing in on Billy. \nCUT: \nSUSAN is worked up to the limit, tries to hug him through the window. \nSUSAN Oh Billy... Billy!  Don't give up. Please don't give up. You'll get out. I know you will! \nRemembers something. Grabs the PHOTO ALBUM with all her strength, holding it up for him to see through the glass.Then remembering herself, looks around the room to make sure they're alone and in a contained voice: \nSUSAN Billy, your father gave me this for you.  There's pictures of your Mom and Dad...Rob...Peg... \nBILLY looks at it listlessly. \nHIS P.V.O - SUSAN holding the album open to PICTURES of his MOTHER and FATHER in front of the house, ROB on a bicycle, PEG in her cheer-leading outfit. \nSUSAN And there's pictures in the back of your old Mr. Franklin.  Remember him... From the bank? \nA certain tone slips into her voice. \nSUSAN He's over in Greece now. He bought a ticket. \nBILLY looks from the album to Susan. Possibly there is a gleam of understanding in his eyes but it is very faint. An Attendant BANGS on Susan's door, OFF. \nVOICE Visiting is over. \nSUSAN quickly puts the album away as if it were a hidden weapon. \nSUSAN I'll give it to them for you. \nShe buttons her blouse but her eyes are worried, on Billy. \nSUSAN You were right Billy don't count on them, you hear, don't count on anybody but yourself! \nThe ATTENDANT now swings open her door, annoyed. \nATTENDANT Let's go! \nSusan stands, about to go, then suddenly leans up close to the bars, hard and practical. \nSUSAN (quickly) If you stay you'll die Billy!  Get out of here. Get to Greece, you hear me?...Billy? \nPause. Silence. She closes her eyes, in pain; she doesn't think she has reached him. She turns to go, resigned. \nBILLY looking at her. Behind him HAMIDOU opens the door. A calm and cunning look on his face, glancing with Billy towards \nA BRIEF GLIMPSE of SUSAN looking back, the album under her arm. The door closes. \nCUT: \nBILLY, with the same deadened expression as before, comes down the STAIRS towards THE WHEEL. It is early morning and the walkers haven't started yet. Billy looks at the Pillar a dire look of reflection passing over his eyes. Then he starts walking but in a clockwise motion, opposite the normal pattern; in the same methodical manner as before. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nBILLY, on the inner track, passes TWO LUNATICS who are walking counter-clockwise. They glare at him, motion for him to turn around. Billy just keeps walking. \nBILLY intersects several more LUNATICS going counter- clockwise They motion for him to turn. \nLUNATIC (grunting) Gower! \nTries to block Billy's way, but BILLY shakes his head, brushes by him - determined. \nAHMET Slides up next to BILLY in his rags. \nAHMET Good morning, my American friend! There will be trouble if you go this way. A good Turk always walks to the right. Left is communist. Right is good. You must go the other way... It's Good. \nMore LUNATICS join the flow, gesturing or grunting at BILLY. \nBILLY STOPS, turns, looks at the rest of them slogging in the usual direction, looks as if he 'sees' them; and he walks out of the wheel, towards the stairs. \nAHMET curious about his unusual behavior, follows BILLY. \nAHMET Why you go?  Why don't you walk the wheel with us? (suspiciously leaning forward, suddenly realizing the answer) The bad machine doesn't know he's a bad machine. You still don't believe it? You still don't believe you're a bad machine? \nANOTHER ANGLE \nBILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET at the base of the STAIRS. BILLY carries on up the stairs. \nAHMET (shakes his head) To know oneself is to know God, my friend. The factory knows.  That's why they put you here. You'll see. You'll find out. Later on you'll know. \nBILLY stops and turns to look at AHMET.  His eyes glint with special knowledge and he takes AHMET into his confidence using the latter's tone of voice: \nBILLY I already know. I know that you're a bad machine.  That's why the factory keeps you here. (Lowers s voice) You know how I know?  I know because I'm from the factory. I make the machines.. I'm here to spy on you. \nEyes narrow. Surprise. Fear. He shuffles away. \nBILLY looks at him and turns up the STAIRS. \nCUT: \nBILLY in his BED. The usual UPROAR. THE ATTENDANT comes by with the pills, offers a handful to BILLY. \nBILLY Those mountains? are they? \nDRIVER (Greece (shakes his head) Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again (pause)) How'd you lose your friends? \nBILLY leaning back in his seat, casual. \nBILLY Oh, I drank a lot of raka last night in Istanbul. Got into a fight. \nIndicates the bruises on his face. \nDRIVER looking at him in the rear view mirror. His curiosity narrowing. \nDRIVER How come you speak Turkish so good? \nBILLY casually glances out the window. \nBILLY Did twenty months in prison in Istanbul.  Hash \nTHE DRIVER studies BILLY in the rear-view mirror. Then: \nDRIVER You want to score some?  Cheap? \nBILLY looks at him hard. Something's wrong with this man. \nBILLY (curt) No! \nCutting off further conversation, he looks out at: \nTHE MOUNTAINS of Greece - with longing. \nBILLY stares back at: \nTHE DRIVER whose eyes now move away from the rear-view mirror under the pressure of the stare.  SOUND OFF loud machinery. \nBILLY turning - in rear window, we see a TURKISH HALFTRACK pulling alongside the cab, SOLDIERS waving their arms for the cabdriver to get out of the way. \nANOTHER ANGLE - the HALFTRACK pulls level. The CABDRIVER slows down, with a curse. \nBILLY - beads of sweat trickle his brow \nTHE PERSONNEL CARRIER, disinterested, pulls past. \nBILLY breathes heavily with nervous relief. \nCUT: \nTHE CAB pulls up to the end of a dirt road. \nBILLY has his MAP out, studying it. \nBILLY The Maritas River? Where is it? \nANOTHER ANGLE - the DRIVER, exasperated, waves southwest. \nDRIVER Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not? \nBILLY Not far. Just a little way. \nDRIVER No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car. \nBILLY I'll pay extra \nDRIVER How much? \nANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY slips him fifty lira. The DRIVER takes it, muttering under his breath, jams the cab into gear. \nTHE CAB follows rutted tracks into low HILLS. \nINTERIOR CAB - very bumpy. \nBILLY Where are the minefields? \nDRIVER All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us. (looks up in the mirror) You sure you looking for your friends, man? \nBILLY(VERY SHARP NOW) (very sharp now) Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it. \nDRIVER (looks back, then ahead, suddenly brightening) Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are \nBILLY's entire expression changes. It is all over. \nA TANK AND HALFTRACK are sitting there by the rutted track, with SOLDIERS. And a little LEAN-TO with several POLICE. Also a couple of attack DOGS on leashes. The Driver honks his horn on the approach. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nDRIVER Hey officer, we're looking for the campground. Do you know where it is? \nANOTHER ANGLE - TWO POLICEMEN and A SOLDIER come sauntering over, their collars open, beer bottles in hand, slightly drunk. \nTHE TANK starts to roll after it. Full speed. The HALFTRACK follows, the MEN riding it shouting. \nBILLY looks back, then looking ahead sees something. \nP.O.V - a speck in the far distance. Another ROADBLOCK. \nBILLY decides, then - \nTHE CAB swerves right off the road and jumps into the gently rolling FIELD on the border of the road, pock marked with HILLS. \nTHE TURKS come roaring down the road, pointing to the cab. \nLOW ANGLE - the TANK makes a flat out stop, gears grinding. \nTHE GUN TURRET swings left. \nTHE CAB in the far distance, at an angle to the tank, starts running up an incline. \nTHE TANK FIRES. \nP.O.V. - SHELL BLASTS WIDE OF THE CAB. \nBILLY, startled, looks back, guns for the top of the incline. \nHIS P.O.V. - ANOTHER SHELL now blasts to his front right, closer. Something heavy (shrapnel) thuds into the rood of the cab. \nBILLY drives all out. \nP.O.V. - THE INCLINE CLOSER, CLOSER, ABOUT TO MAKE IT, THEN: A BLAST \nTANK P.O.V. - the CAB spinning in the blast of the adjacent shell-burst. \nBILLY, shaken but unhurt, staggers out of the cab, looks: \nP.O.V. - A WHEEL BLASTED AWAY, FUEL PISSING OUT FROM THE SHRAPNEL HOLES, SMASHED WINDSHIELD AND FENDER. \nTHE TURKS are coming up the incline now, like the Cavalry -- some on foot running, others on the HALFTRACK.  BULLETS whistle and pop nearby. \nBILLY running. He tears off his jacket. \nSOLDIERS pass the wrecked car, at the top of the incline shouting, pointing and firing at \nBILLY in the distance. \nONE SOLDIER seems lighter than the others and takes off in a sprint as the OTHERS follow. \nTHE HALFTRACK now crests the incline and gathering full gear and momentum, roars off down the slope after Billy. \nCLOSE BILLY running sweat all over him. In background, the HALFTRACK and running FIGURES. \nBILLY runs into a high dry cornfield with the sun starting to set ahead of him in the Greek mountains. \nMOUNTAINS - must make those mountains. \nBILLY running all out - eyes fixed on them, breathing, skipping heartbeats. \nTHE PERSONNEL CARRIER bypasses the FAST SOLDIER who slows down, panting. Billy has outrun him. \nOTHER SOLDIERS run up in the distance. \nBILLY, tireless, obsessed, runs right into a POPPY FIELD.It is a splendid beautiful scarlet red, set off by the dipping rays of the sun. \nHIS FEET smashing down the poppy plants.  Fast - THUCK! THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK!  THUCK! \nCROSSCUT the metal TREADS of the Halftrack into the poppy, mowing down entire rows. \nTWO SOLDIERS on the PERSONNEL CARRIER are waving encouragement to the driver inside. They have him. \nANOTHER ANGLE the HALFTRACK closing the distance on BILLY now thirty yards apart. \nBILLY looking back, starting to fade. Huge wheezing gasps of breath. \nSOLDIERS running up looking at \nTHE HALFTRACK in the distance. \nSOLDIERS yell. \nSOLDIERS Minefield!  Minefield! Come back! Stop! (NO SUBTITLE) \nBILLY runs out of the POPPY FIELD into a THIN FOREST. \nTHE SOLDIERS screaming in the distance, jumping up and down waving for the halftrack to come back. \nLOW ANGLE - the HALFTRACK with the waving SOLDIERS on board now blasts out of the poppy field at full speed. \nBILLY -- he has no chance, In immediate background is the fast HALFTRACK. \n", "test1_input": "MIDNIGHT EXPRESS \nScreenplay by Oliver Stone \nBased on The Autobiography by Billy Hayes with William Hoffer \nRevised Draft June, 1977 \nPROLOGUE BLACK SCREEN - SUPERIMPOSE: \nTHE FOLLOWING IS BASED ON A TRUE STORY. \nIT OCTOBER 6, 1970 ISTANBUL, \nTURKEY - \nSOUND UNDER, SHARP: CRACKLE - RIP - SNIP... \nFADE IN: \nA SET OF CLOTHES ON A HOTEL ROOM BED -- trenchcoat, bulky white turtle-neck sweater, T-shirt, jeans, Western style boots.

Moving to: \nHASHISH PLAQUE. Four of them, thinly pressed. One on top of the other. The HAND wrapping a portion of the TAPE around them and: \nBELLY, TIGHT. SOUNDS of BREATHING stop. The belly is sucked in. The TAPE is pulled HARD across, then CLINCHED.  We hear F.X. of HEART BEAT-- \nMOVE UP THE CHEST TO: \nBILLY HAYES - 21, baby-face, attractive, medium build an aura of innocence. His eyes moving off his belly to: \nMIRROR.  FULL SHOT.  Climax.  A creature in a bondage of his own devise, he is naked in his underpants, his body criss-crossed by a network of TAPE and 40 tightly pressed plaques of HASHISH in every conceivable crevice of his body. The eyes are hard. \nNIX THROUGH HEART BEAT, SOUNDS OF AIRPORT. \nCUT: \nINTERIOR \nISTANBUL AIR TERMINAL dirty, crowded, wooden benches, peddlers.  Turkish flight instructions on LOUDSPEAKER, followed by mediocre English translations. NOTE: ALL DIALOGUE IN TURKISH TO FOLLOW WILL BE MARKED OFF BY PARENTHESIS. A CERTAIN WILL BE SUBTITLED, BUT SOME NOT. \nLOUDSPEAKER VOICE Pan American Flight 1 to Frankfurt, London, and New York has arrived and will be ready for boarding at Gate 7 in 20 minutes. \nREPEAT IN ENGLISH over: \nBILL walking down a long CORRIDOR. He moves somewhat stuffly in the clothes we saw laid out on the bed; his face complicated by dark, rather ridiculous aviator sunglasses and an increasing edge of nervousness to his actions. With him is: \nSUSAN 23, healthy outdoor looks, dressed casually colorful like an American student abroad. \nAPPROACHING P.O.V. - a group of TURKISH SECURITY GUARDS, in rumpled green uniforms, at a security CHECKPOINT inspect the carry-on bags of several PASSENGERS. \nBILLY tensely contemplating the guards as he walks. \nSUSAN digging in her bag for her passport as she walks. \nBILLY, looking from guards ahead to SUSAN. He suddenly breaks stride, still a fair distance from the checkpoint. SUSAN glances at him. He is holding his belly. \nBILLY I think I've been poisoned. \nSUSAN And you ate two baclavas, right? I not to touch them, mine was awful. \nBILLY (his voice strained) Look, I think I'm going to have to go to the john again.  You go on through, I'll catch up. \nWith a sense of panic, he turns and goes back down the corridor without waiting for a response.  SUSAN concerned, moves on. \nCUT: \nBILLY in the  WASHROOM MIRROR, again checks himself out. His glasses are off, and he has just watered himself down. But the SOUND of his HEARTBEAT is up, and his nerves are visible in his eyeballs and he knows it.  He dabs at the sweat on his sideburns.  He closes his eyes, takes a DEEP BREATH.  A pause. He puts his dark sunglasses back on. Turns away from the mirror.  No going back now. \nADVANCING P.O.V. - SECURITY CHECKPOINT.  The GUARDS again. Closer, closer, Guns in their HOLSTERS. SOUND of billy's heartbeat, \nCLOSE - GUARD smoking a cigarette, bored, uniform, looks at BILLY. \nCUT: \nThe GUARDS again.SOUND of Billy's in a tattered olive \n", "test1_true": "BILLY PASSPORT. The Guard's tobacco-stained FINGERS take it open it. Basic information on Billy: Birth Date April 17, 1949.  Birth Place: Babylon, Long Island. No wife, no minors.  Signature. \nGUARD gives it back to BILLY. \nGUARD Bag! \nBILLY opens his shoulder bag, proffers it. The GUARD tosses it, pushing aside books, grabbing a white plastic dish. \nGUARD Nebu? \nBILLY (Understand the Turkish expression, \"What's this?\") It's a frisbee. \nGUARD Nebu? \nBILLY A Frisbee. (makes a throwing gesture of the wrist) You throw, catch it.  Game! \nCurious, one of the other GUARDS ambles over looking at the frisbee. \nBILLY tightens. Cursing the frisbee. Sweat now runs his sideburns again.  HEARTBEAT up. \n2ND GUARD American game. Baseball. \nGUARD Ah! (puzzled, turns the Frisbee around and around) \nTHE SECOND GUARD studies BILLY curious about the sweat. Suddenly reaches up, indicates the eyes. \nGUARD Take off the glasses. \nBILLY understanding the gesture rather than the words, removes his glasses. His eyes. Straight, staring at the GUARD without trying to look away. A long moment. \nFIRST GUARD stuffs the frisbee back into the bag. Scowls. Takes a puff on his cigarette, coughs. Phlegm rattles around in his throat. \nReads the International Herald Tribune, seated on a crowded olive-colored out on the tarmac She has saved him a seat and pulls her bag off as BILLY sits down. \nFIRST GUARD Aaaah! \nHe waves BILLY through. \nBILLY puts his glasses walks past the back the SECOND GUARD turns away.  BILLY walks past the Checkpoint. His HEARTBEAT drops. \nSUSAN reads the International Herald Tribune, seated on an crowded olive-colored BUS out on the tarmac.  She has save him a seat and pulls her bag off as BILLY sits down. \nSUSAN Are you all right? \nHe looks at her. Relief. A smile, awkward - he wishes he could tell her. \nBILLY Yeah... Yeah. \nLays his head back on the wooden bench. Reaches out: \nTAKES HER HAND in his. She returns the grip. \nTHE BUS DOOR slams shut. \nTHE TURKISH BUS DRIVER rolls the bus out towards the PLANES visible in the far distance?. \nSUSAN, feeling Billy is better, shows him the Herald Tribune. \nSUSAN (saddened) D'you see this?  Janis Joplin died yesterday. \nBILLY, his sunglasses removed, looks at the paper, almost abstractedly. \nSUSAN (OFF) Overdose, in a Hollywood motel. \nNEWSPAPER Picture of JANIS JOPLIN.  That big, earthy, rugged smile. \nBILLY'S P.O.V. - Moves Up page One To The Headline: NIXON OUT-RAGED AT PALESTINIAN HIJACKERS: CALLS FOR CAPITAL PUNISHMENT \nSUSAN (a faint voice) Never Was anybody like Janis. \nBILLY, thinking other happier things, reaches over and playful!.:squeezes her tit twice, rapidly. \nBILLY (smiles) Never was anybody like you... \nSUSAN (annoyed, brushes his hand away ,a clicking sound in her throat) You can't take anything seriously. \nBILLY (smiles) You're right. \nBus stops suddenly. BILLY changes expression. \nTHROUGH FRONT WINDSHIELD we see TURKISH SOLDIERS in several HALFTRACKS drawn up in a semicircle blocking the bus. The Pan American PLANE is directly behind. Also JEEPS and a POLICEMAN waving the bus down. \nBUS BOOR opens and the Turkish Police OFFICER hops aboard briskly: \nOFFICER Attention please, Ladies and Gentlemen. For your own safety we're conducting a security check before you board your airplane, Kindly file out the back. Women and children in one line. Men in another. \nPASSENGERS.  A confused hum. \n", "test1_id": 0, "test2_input": "The DOOR flies open and ANOTHER OFFICER strides in. Paunchy, moustached. The room is suddenly silent as we TRACK him in, followed by a grinning civilian FLUNKY with a big portable photo instrument and bulb. \nTHE FIRST OFFICER jumps up from the desk, makes an obsequious salute to the SECOND OFFICER who arrogantly acknowledges it and takes the vacated chair behind the desk. The FIRST OFFICER moves to the first fold-up chair in the row, pushing the police officer in that chair further down. THIS OFFICER, in turn, shoves the next man down. It goes all the way down the line like a comedy until the last man in the row stands up against the wall. But this is all in the background as: \nSECOND OFFICER Name? \nBILLY William Hayes. \nSECOND OFFICER Vil... Vilyum...? \nBILLY Hayes... \nSharp SOUND OFF of FILM BEING RIPPED FROM CAMERA. He darts a look at \nPOLICEMAN stretching the undeveloped film out.  Another loud SOUND OFF, interrupting this-- \nTHE DOOR flies open again and a THIRD OFFICER strides in, obviously the most important yet, because the SECOND OFFICER jumps up from the desk, and all the others immediately move down one seat in the hierarchy without a moment's hesitation. But the THIRD OFFICER strides right up to Billy, waves to the SECOND OFFICER.  THE CAMERAMAN in background bubbles with enthusiasm, sliding into position. Billy is puzzled - what's going on?  His arm is grabbed and he is swivelled around. \nREVERSE ANGLE - OVER CAMERAMAN \nBILLY in the middle, flanked by SECOND and THIRD OFFICER, grinning like big game hunters, their arms on his shoulders. The FIRST OFFICER, sticking a bunch of hashish plaques into Billy's hands, runs OUT OF FRAME. BILLY looks from side to side. The SECOND OFFICER pats him hard on the back of the head, meaning 'look at camera'. BILLY glances at him, sees the grin on both the officers' faces. Thinking this is the necessary expression, he grins at the camera. \nCAMERAMAN disgustedly looks up from his eyepiece. \nCAMERAMAN No.. He's smiling. Make him look miserable. \nSECOND OFFICER slugs BILLY in the stomach with a quick back-handed fist. BILLY groans, sinks to his knees. The plaques fall on the floor. \nFIRST OFFICER (running up) Gel?  Gel?? \nHe growls, grabbing Billy's arm and hauling him up, gathering the hashish plaques and putting them back in his arms. The TWO OFFICERS put their arms back on Billy's shoulders. BILLY, in pain, makes the proper expression of misery. \nFLASH!  The bulb goes. \nCUT: \nTHE 707 PAN AMERICAN PLANE, destination New York, roars up into the sky. PULL BACK all the way to BILLY sitting next to the window, huddled over, feeling woozy and near vomiting.  He glimpses the plane but it is anti-climatic now; as he stares down at his boots. Then remembers something! Surprised. \nANOTHER ANGLE - ROOM. The Turkish OFFICERS talk AD LIB among themselves, congratulating, slapping shoulders, pointing to the hashish plaques, etc. \nIn center background, we see BILLY submissively lifting his arm for permission to speak, \nTHIRD OFFICER nods, approaches, followed by OTHERS. \nBILLY slowly, partly out of pain, pulls off one of his boots, bangs it on the heel and two more PLAQUES clatter to the floor. \nTURKISH MOUTHS drop open. \nBILLY finishes the process with the other boot. An awkward silence OFF. \nBILLY (trying to explain, innocent) I forgot... I really did. (makes ineffective gestures) \nANOTHER ANGLE. The room explodes with screams and commotion. AD LIB: \nTHIRD OFFICER (screaming at SECOND OFFICER) You idiot, you fool. You told me the American was searched... and he's pulling hashish out of his boots!  You're all dogshit! \nSECOND OFFICER (turning on First Officer, screaming) You worthless piece of garbage, where did you learn to search a prisoner?  He's been in our custody for an hour, etc. \nFIRST OFFICER (screaming at the others) Who searched him?  Who? \nAmid all the screaming TWO POLICEMEN rush over and yank BILLY upwards, and start to strip all his clothes. \nBILLY (protesting) That's it! That's all I have! \nCUT: \nBILLY spread-eagled STARK NAKED against the wall. He is afraid to move. A strange silence. \nANOTHER ANGLE. BILLY naked in center B.G. against the wall.The OFFICERS and SOLDIERS quietly leering at his trim, muscular buttocks. Hungry stares.  Bisexuality is prevalent in Turkey.But there is also embarrassment among the officers; none would do anything openly in front of the others; instead they just stare and smoke their cigarettes. Low murmurs. Continued telephone calls. Much thick smoke all over the room. \nAnother DOOR opens OFF. Obsequious GREETINGS in Turkish. \nBILLY is afraid to look over his shoulder, feeling enormously humiliated. \nVOICE (OFF) Howdy, Billy. Howya doing, Ok? \nA perfect Texas drawl. BILLY glances over his shoulder. Sees: \nTEX a tall, lanky blonde-haired American in a business suit with boots. Clean cut, very handsome, with a strong flavour of danger in his blue eyes. \nTEX (smiling, extends Billy's clothes) I think these gentlemen have finished for the time being if you'd like to put your clothes on. \nANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, so grateful at last to see a fellow American, reaches quietly for the clothes, his eyes never leaving Tex. Release? \nCUT: \nTURKISH DETECTIVE sits at the main desk in the room.  Unlike the others, he has no moustache; a skeletal face, intelligent looking.  TEX Is behind, leaning casually up against the wall. Angled to Billy's side is the entire array of seated OFFICERS looking on like a tribunal. \n", "test2_true": "BILLY, standing to the side of the desk, clothed now, buckling his belt - afraid. \nBILLY No, I'm not afraid. \nDETECTIVE Good. There's nothing to be afraid of. If you co-operate with us, you will be on the plane for New York tomorrow... yes? \nBILLY (softly, hoping) Yes...? \nDETECTIVE Good. Now, where did you get the hashish? \nBILLY A cabdriver. He picked me up in the Pudding Shoppe in the bazaar. \nDETECTIVE Would you recognize him again? \nBILLY Yes.  I think so. \nDETECTIVE Good.  Would you go back to the Pudding Shoppe now and point him out to my men if you see him? \nBILLY'S EYES MOVE TO: \nTEX who makes a cool affirmative nod of the eyes to Billy. \nBILLY (OFF) Yes. \nSTREETS, ISTANBUL, AFTERNOON. TEX drives his American CAR; BILLY in the passenger seat; TWO TURKISH PLAINCLOTHESMEN in the rear seats . Various BACKGROUND SHOTS of the city. \nTEX (casual tone) You decided to fly at a bad time Billy Palestinian Guerrillas all over the place blowing up planes and all. \nBILLY (shakes his head) Stupid. \nTEX Four planes in four days...but I guess you kids don't read the newspapers...and what with our people kicking up a shit storm 'bout the flow of heroin from Turkey you got... \nBILLY But didn't have heroin. \nTURK (grins) Well I'm not up on all that. A drug's a drug seems to me Billy and... \nBILLY (sweating) But it was my first time. I'm not really a smuggler, was just two kilos. \nTEX Well, you see Billy, it don't really matter right now if it's 2 kilos or 200 kilos. The Turks love to catch any foreigner smuggling - it shows the world they're fighting the drug trade. \nBILLY But just... \nTEX Just what? \nBILLY I just needed some extra money.  I was broke, the guy offered me the hash and... \nIt sounds bad. Tex looks at him without expression. Pause.Billy tries to sense a sympathy in this ambiguous man, a liking towards himself. But feels nothing yet, except someone who can speak English. \nBILLY ...are you with the Consulate? \nTEX (not looking at him) Something like that. Cigarette? \nANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY nervously takes the pack and matches. \nTEX How much you pay this joker... this cab driver? \nBILLY Two hundred dollars. It was my last two hundred. \nTEX How much did you figure to make? \nBILLY fumbles to light up his cigarette. He is nervous, grateful to volunteer any information...anything. \nBILLY Three, four thousand...I don't know.  The guy offered me the hash-- (shakes his head) ...it just seemed like easy money. \nTEX Beats working. \nBILLY I was just going to sell it to friends.  I'm not a pusher, honest. \nTEX grins, sceptical of his naivete, changing the subject. \nTEX Got a family back there? \nBILLY (inhales deeply) Yeah. Parents, brother, sister. Babylon, Long Island. \nTEX What's your father do? \nBILLY He sells insurance for Metropolitan Life. \nTEX (a pause, not looking at Billy) Be tough on 'em. \nBILLY nods, takes a deep drag on his cigarette. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nTEX Girlfriend? \nBILLY ...She was on the plane. \n", "test2_id": 1, "test3_input": "BILLY naked, totally passive, semiconscious. HAMIDOU suddenly shifts position and snaps Billy into a strenuous wrestling hold across his knee on the steamy floor. He loosens him up by cracking his bones along his back. \nHAMIDOU - sweat pouring off his face, excited. \nHAMIDOU ...And I fuck your grandmother and I fuck your pretty girlfriend... And I fuck you Hi-yes!) \nA bizarre otherworldly scene. This man is dredging Billy through a sadistic imagination sparked by the steam, the sweat, and an ethnic identification with a Turkish steam bath as a bedroom. He loosens his hold abruptly, rises, moves off as: \nBILLY holds himself on his knees, head sunk on his chest, gasping for breath, about to vomit. Pause; he looks up horrified at: \nHAMIDOU pouring fresh buckets of water on the floor. SSSSSSSSSS!  The awakened STEAM coils like a snake into every cranny of the little room. \nBLURRED VISUALS - HAMIDOU stripping his shirt off. A huge muscular flash of chest, \nA BELT being snapped open. \nBILLY waiting. \nA FIGURE moving through the steam, closer. \nBILLY backing away from it. \nSTEAM - a glint of a FACE coming through.  HAMIDOU - his eyes so intense they seem to burn off the steam like sun cutting haze. Then disappear again. \nBILLY pulls back. A pause. Silence. Cat and mouse.  Then very suddenly: \nA HAND reaches out of the STEAM and GRABS BILLY by the hair.  A GRUNT, OFF. \nBILLY his eyes moving fast. \nA FLASH of a huge darkened penis, fully erect cutting forward into the steam like a from drill, detached from the rest of the body. \nA SOUND - grotesque and so sudden after the silence it jars the senses. A BLURRED VISUAL then: \nBILLY Launching forward in SLOW MOTION, desperation distorting his features and: \nSTEAM - then BILLY'S HEAD SLAMS through it in SLOW MOTION and: \nSMASHES the penis with its skull. A horrifying GASP. \nBLURRED VISUALS - STEAM - HAMIDOU staggering CLOSE - surprise, pain... \nBILLY MOVING. \nA FOOT coming up fast through the steam, connecting again with the genitals. Another SCREAM. \nA BODY hitting the tiles. \nBILLY groping for the falaka stick. Raises it. \nA STRUGGLE - Two bodies thrashing, one of them screaming now in pain. A definitive sound then a THWACK! Another thwack!  The steam seems to clear and \nBILLY is on top of the gigantic HAMIDOU smashing him with the falaka stick with all his might. \nHAMIDOU is in contortions, his nose busted and bleeding. \nHis HAND gripping BILLY by the neck, forcing him back and strangling him at the same time. Billy is red in the face, such is the force of this creature but continues to beat him, harder, harder.  His expression filled with a life energy, seeded in hatred, that he thought he had lost. Again, Again - \nBILLY Babba sikijam, Hamidu!  I fuck your Mother, I fuck your daughter, I fuck your sons, I fuck your wife! \nThe BAND slips from his throat, then springs up desperately again and clenches Billy's whole face with one gigantic palm, clawing to get in, then just as quickly slips away. BILLY beats on - again, again. \nBLOOD flows fast in agitated swirls into the little pool. \nCUT: \nBILLY opens a door gently, moves across an empty CORRIDOR, dressed in and gun in intense. Hamidou's holster. large uniform with his He looks shaken, weak, falaka stick dizzy but \nVOICE (OFF) How about a shoe shine, friend? \nBILLY starts, clenches the falaka stick ready to spring, spins. \nA LITTLE SHOESHINE BOY is his case down the corridor. \nBILLY has not seen a child in a long time. get words out, then manages: Surprised.  Can't get the words out, then manages: \nBILLY No! \nTHE KID shrugs, moves on, looking At Billy strangely. \nBILLY goes up a flight of STAIRS.  Ahead, VOICES passing. He stops. Goes on. \nBILLY goes through an empty GUARD QUARTERS. \nBILLY is in another CORRIDOR, approaches \nA SMALL PORTAL, daylight at its edges.  Locked? \n", "test3_true": "DAYLIGHT! \nBILLY squints.  Adjusting to the harsh sensation. \nAN ISTANBUL STREET - TRAFFIC, SOUNDS.  TWO GUARDS approaching the portal in the distance, drinking soda pop. \nBILLY steps back, straightens his clothes, steps out briskly and at such an angle that \nTHE TWO GUARDS don't notice him in the traffic  as they enter the open portal. \nLONG SHOT - BILLY walking down the street, looking back, almost bewildered, not quiet believing this. \nCUT: \nTIGHT - RAILROAD TICKET being stamped.  SOUND - SNAP. MOVE UP to TICKET CLERK behind a grill. \nVOICE (OFF) Edirne to Uzun Kopru? \nTHE CLERK looks puzzled. \nBILLY is on the other side of the grill.  A ill-fitting new Western style suit, a hat over his dyed black hair; totally paranoid. He hasn't slept in three days and the bruises from the Hamidou beating now show clearly black and blue on his face. His eyes are alert, darting around, his speech clipped and to the point. \nBILLY What's the matter? \nTHE CLEF!!  Shrugs. \nCLERK 'What are you crazy? There's no train anymore to Uzun Kopru, it'd have to go through Greece.

He looks at the: \nEMPTY TRACKS - No 'midnight express'. \nCUT: \nBILLY, tenser than ever, uses the occasion of buying a newspaper at an OUTDOOR STAND to study: \nTHE MAIN SQUARE of the VILLAGE (EDIRNE) - DAY. SOLDIERS and POLICE are abundant, chattering bustling amid tanks and half-tracks.  Mountains can be seen in the far distance. \nBILLY camouflages his face as best he can in the Newspaper \"Hurriyet\" studying: \nCABDRIVERS in the Main Square.  Most of them are older, grizzled looking standing next to their old battered dusty cabs talking with stray SOLDIERS. Billy's eyes settle on a YOUNGER DRIVER with longish hair, possibly an ally. \nBILLY glances down at his newspaper as a SOLDIER intersects and his expression goes stony as he sees: \nFULL COLOR DRAWING (first page) of a ridiculously fierce heavy-muscled barechested MAN beating a facsimile of Hamidou into the ground.  Next to it a blurry badly reproduced photograph of BILLY with a superimposed GUN in his hand. You can't really tell it's him. \nBILLY, controlling himself, crumples up the newspaper into a baton, his eyes everywhere.  Be the darting A crosses square. \nANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY, intersecting a POLICEMAN who glances at him, joins the YOUNG CABDRIVER.. \nBILLY Listen, I have Swedish friends camping south of the town. I was supposed to meet them here this morning but I was late. Can you take me there? \nDRIVER looks at him neutral. \nDRIVER You know where they are? \nBILLY (anxious to get in the cab) Sure. \nDRIVER How far? \nBILLY (impatient) About ten kilometers. \nDRIVER Sixty Lira? \nBILLY (surprised) Sixty? \nBilly eyes: \nAPPROACHING SOLDIERS. \nBILLY (OFF) Okay. \nTHE DRIVER, noticing Billy's look at the soldiers, gets in the cab. \nBILLY climbs into the back seat, feeling already he has made a mistake. There is something too alert, too hard in this young driver. \nCUT: \nBILLY P.O.V. - THE MOUNTAINS as they roll in the taxi. FORESTS - FIELDS. \nINTERIOR TAXI \n", "test3_id": 2}

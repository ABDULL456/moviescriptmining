NORMAN If I'd known there was so much reading involved, I would have brought a completely different group of people who hate me. Neil suddenly YELLS out victoriously. Everyone turns to him, hardly believing he might have found the answer. He waves a book triumphantly above his head and grins at everyone. 
NEIL Yes! Book number one! Finished! That is right, twenty six pages, oh yeah! Everyone GROANS and turns back to their bickering. ParaNorman 65.

COURTNEY I can't believe this is your plan! I'm gonna get bitten and start eating peoples' brains! I'm supposed to be Vegan! Mitch suddenly SHOUTS out from the doorway. 
MITCH Guys! There's something moving out there! I think it's the zombies! 
ALVIN 
(HYSTERICAL) Hide! 
MITCH Oh, no it's not. It's just grown- ups. 
ALVIN 
(MORE HYSTERICAL) Hide! 
EXT. TOWN HALL - SAME 
The square outside is awash with threatening townsfolk, led by Mrs Henscher and Deputy Dwayne. Some charge up the Town Hall steps, JEERING and WHISTLING. 
INT. TOWN HALL LOBBY - CONTINUOUS 
Blurry silhouettes move across the outside of the window, occasionally SMACKING against them with their fists. A brick SMASHES through a window and CLATTERS across the floor between Courtney's feet. 
INT. TOWN HALL ARCHIVES - CONTINUOUS 
The kids start to hurry toward the lobby, leaving Norman sitting amongst the spilled documents. 
MITCH That sound. Y'know what that is? That's not awesome... things... 
NORMAN Guys, come on! 
ALVIN Just give it up, weiner! 
NORMAN We have to keep trying! ParaNorman 66. 
114 CONTINUED: 114 
COURTNEY We tried and look what happened! 
(SIGHS) I'm scared, Norman, and I can't listen to this any more. Norman looks at the faces in front of him. The kids are scared and confused and angry. Even Neil has nothing encouraging to offer. Norman's brow furrows. 
NORMAN You never listen! No one ever listens! I'm scared too, but I've still gotta do this.

{"train": "WHITE JAZZ \nWritten by \nMatthew Michael Carnahan & Joe Carnahan \nBased on the novel \"White Jazz\" by James Ellroy \nLegend: Recife, Brazil, 1983 \n1   INT. HILLSIDE VILLA - MORNING                                 1 \nStare at my broken face in a gilded mirror. The breaks occurred a lifetime ago, healed uneven. I wear a white tropical button-down, a Republican-gold Rolex, a pirate-patch over what was my left eye. \nME (V.O.) I'm old. And all I have left is the will to remember... \nI reach into a dresser drawer, pull out a yellowed black & white picture of HER: this beatific blonde, sleeping. Below me is a week-old L.A. Times with the headline: Matriarch of Television Series, Empire Ridge, Retires. \nThe Matriarch's picture in the middle.                            * \nME (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and the fear I'll forget... \nSlide HER over the Matriarch's picture: the Matriarch 30 years younger now. Lift my eyes back to my reflection. \nME (V.O.) (CONT'D) I killed innocent men. I betrayed sacred oaths. I reaped profit from horror. The names are dead or too guilty to tell. The events so brutal they beg to be re-told... \nLegend: Los Angeles, Fall 1958 \n2   INT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - FIGHT NIGHT                         2 \nThe battered face of an Irish Pug. Same guy? No. A hard jab bashes the Pug out of frame. And there I am: next to the `Ring' Magazine Reporter chewing the ass out of his cigar. \nME (V.O.) Lieutenant Dave Klein, Vice Division. LAPD. That's what my face looked like before. \nMy point of view now: Irish Pug on the business end of this bantam Black's combos. Standing to my left: SERGEANT RICHARD \"JUNIOR\" STEMMONS. Twenty-six. \nME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Junior Stemmons. A partner I never asked for. The scowl meant to hide a shit-scared kid who'd been teaching evidence classes three months ago. His Old-Man was an LAPD lifer who never got past Sergeant. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS We should make our move now. \nME Mid-fight? Look at the crowd: you wanna be at the center of a riot? \nJUNIOR STEMMONS I don't wanna be here when Noonan and the Feds show up. \nI point at the bantam Black: \nME We let Sanderline finish this beating, we get his gratitude.                          * \nJunior eyes the exits clockwise, nervous, waiting for `Untouchables' to break the doors down. I hate the way panic smells when I stand this close to it. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS We gonna let Rock-a-bye fight too- \nME -relax Junior. \n3   INT. LOCKER ROOM - MOMENTS LATER                              3 \nThe Bantam Black: SANDERLINE JOHNSON. Led through the double doors. He sees me, then his gaze shifts to Junior popping jabs inches from REUBEN RUIZ: a muscled middle-weight, fight- taped hands cuffed behind his back. I smile big: \nME Sanderline, I'm Lieutenant Klein of the LAPD and a real big fan- \nJUNIOR STEMMONS -you're under arrest. \nSanderline spooks, steps back. Turn and make sure Junior sees the fire in my eyes, keep staring at Junior as I speak to Sanderline again: \nME No you're not. Reuben is- \nREUBEN RUIZ -Lieutenant Dave why you arrest- \nME -for being a ranked fighter who still steals hubcaps. Shut up. (off Ruiz, back to Sanderline) If I was gonna arrest you, I wouldn't have let you finish: and that hook-uppercut combo you got is something special. (from Reuben, beat) Reuben's in custody. But you could be our Guest. Whaddya say? \n4   EXT. OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM - MOMENT LATER                        4 \nMe, Junior, Reuben, and Sanderline aim for the nearest exit. Behind the stands. Reuben and Sanderline in street clothes, hats pulled down tight. Feature the Announcer: \nRING ANNOUNCER Ladies and Gentleman...due to circumstances beyond our control, Rock-A-Bye Ruiz will not fight this- \n-BOOS drown the PA. Beer and lit cigars shell the Announcer. Fights erupt in the stands. I can't stifle a chuckle. Three exits down: day late-dollar short Feds. WELLES NOONAN, elbows- out, surveying the scene like a half-assed Rommel. \nME (V.O.) Welles Noonan, US Attorney. Ivy League Crimefighter. Launching a big boxing probe as a way to begin prying into everything else crooked and corrupt in LA. \nMove faster. \nUNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.) Me and Sam G. \nME (V.O.) G for `Giancana.' I owe him favors for the rest of my life. \nUNIDENTIFIED VOICE (O.S.) We're out at the place in Palm Springs. You should come out for the weekend. \nME Tell Sam if I get minute- \nUNIDENTIFIED VOICE -yer gonna have to make a minute for him. Now. See, we think the Spade might testify that Sam owns him and how we was grooming him for a title shot he was gonna tank. A fight everybody woulda' got flush off of, including the Spade.                        * (beat, quieter) Have him look out the window Klein. \nClick. A breath. Drop the phone on the cradle...step to the window...open it...then I chuckle genuine: \nME Sanderline, you gotta see this... \nTrusting puppy Sanderline steps to the window: \nSANDERLINE JOHNSON What'm I- \n-smash his head against the frame using his forward motion. He loses muscle control for the split-second it takes me to pitch his legs up and out. My face a quick-change evil mask. \nFeature Sanderline's nine-story fall. That Ambassador Hotel robe billows behind him like a cape. He detonates an overhead streetlight with a bomb sound, then hits the driveway. \nUnzip my fly, hustle into the bathroom, screams from outside now. Flush the toilet as Junior and Ruiz pile through the door. Step out, play it baffled: look at the bed where Sanderline sat, then the open window, screams floating up... \nME DID THAT MUTT JUST JUMP? \nLunge to the window: Sanderline post-mortem. Head shattered. Valets sprinting. Junior on the phone. Ruiz steps-up next to me: horrified. I keep staring at the smashed body...whisper: \nME (CONT'D) Remember where you live. \nReuben has to use both hands to steady himself. \n6   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - BRADLEY'S OFFICE - MORNING           6 \nSpartan space appointed with high-ticket items like the mahogany table around which we sit. Outside: echoes of a protest filter through the windows: \nMUFFLED PROTEST AMALGAM (O.C.) MEXICAN BROTHERS SI! IMPERIAL DODGERS NO! \nFour of us at the table glued to the T.V, watching U.S. Attorney Welles Noonan lambasting the LAPD. \nME (V.O.) LA's version of the Young Turks, only meaner. (MORE) \nME (V.O.) (cont'd) Boyce Bradley, Chief of Detectives. Smartest man in town. And one of the richest: Dad was a Real Estate Developer who owned a strip of land that's now known as the Santa Monica Freeway. On either side, Bradley's book-ends: D.A. Bob Gallaudet, not the smartest man in town: `Gas Chamber' Bob cribbed my notes at USC Law. And Tom Bethune, running for a City Council seat that'll decide if this Mexican slum called Chavez Ravine gets bulldozed and renamed `Dodger Stadium.'              * \nBRADLEY Turn it off. \nBethune leaps like a lapdog, hits the power. \nME I was pissing. He was jumping. \nBradley picks up a newspaper: \nBRADLEY `US Attorney Noonan is accusing the Los Angeles Police Department in general, and Lt. David Klein in particular, of murder at worst, gross incompetence at best...' \nME Noonan had Sanderline scared. After he sang to me he panicked & jumped. \nTOM BETHUNE He did spend a month in Camarillo Mental Hospital last year- \nGAS CHAMBER BOB -and wearing that hotel robe over his clothes makes him look even more looney-bin. \nTOM BETHUNE Plus, Reuben Ruiz recanted. So Noonan's Boxing Probe is dead. He's got nothing- \nBRADLEY -but time, a mandate and new targets...I need to speak to the Lieutenant alone. \nBob and Tom nod, pat my back on the way out: proud uncles lending support before Dad drops the hammer. Door closes. I stand, step to the window, big Pro-Mex protest below: Geeks and placards: `BASEBALL IS AS AMERICAN AS THE TRAIL OF TEARS! \nBRADLEY (CONT'D) Describe to me your duty, as you understood it, regarding Sanderline Johnson and Reuben Ruiz. \nME Take both men into custody before Noonan and the Feds could, and find                   * out what they were going to tell- \nBRADLEY -and why did I choose you for this? \nME Because I'm a Cop with a law degree, and you thought my legal- \nBRADLEY -because your a thug with a law degree. Because I thought by now you'd be so indebted to this Department for not indicting and/or                   * imprisoning you, that diligent, honest discharge of duty would be assured. (beat) And I made a horrible misjudgment.                    * \nME Bethune and Gallaudet don't think so. \nBRADLEY Bob's happy because he wants to be State Attorney General and his most likely opponent will be Welles Noonan. Tom's happy because Morton Diskant, who's leading their City Council race, is endorsed by Noonan. Thus, they're not seeing the larger play. (with calculated emphasis) Noonan's new target will likely be the LAPD itself. \nME How do you know that? \nME What would Mom and Dad say? \nME Nothing. That's where I learned it. \nShe stands, goes to the stove. \nMEG Poor you. \nME Yeah, pour me...a cup please. Black, no sugar. \nMeg stares darts. I smile to defuse. \nME (CONT'D) Pretty please. \nShe fetches cups and saucers. \nME (CONT'D) How's work?                                             * \nMEG It's work. \nME How's Pete? \nMEG More work. \nQuiet while we wait for the pot...and quiet always means creeping sleep: an Enemy I never stop fighting. Force my eyes open, shift in my seat: I've been exhausted for years. \nI drift despite my best efforts and for a split second you see the Hell I see when sleep wins: \n10   INT./EXT. NIGHTMARE                                          10 \nFire where the clouds should be -- POP -- in a backseat, point-blank Tommy-gunning two smiling men -- POP -- Marine fatigues soaked in blood, plunging my bayonet into a cheesecake-white belly -- POP -- that beautiful blonde from       * the Olympic, smiling -- POP-                                      * \n11   INT. WESTWOOD COTTAGE - SAME MOMENT                          11 \n-awake. My leg jerks, kicks a big Wing-Tip. A cup of coffee pipes in front of me. Then voices. I turn: PETE BONDURANT has his hands on my sister's shoulders. \nME (V.O.) Big Pete Bondurant. One-time LA Sheriff. Bounced when he beat-dead a Prisoner who spit at him. A duly impressed Howard Hughes hired him on as his full-time muscle. My Sister's new Hump. My oldest living Friend. \nPETE (turns back at me) You look like Death taking a shit. \nMeg cackles. \nMEG He's still got that MGM-face. \nPETE You're still the only guy who ever traded movie-potential for Police work. \nMEG Because in the movies they make you pull your punches. \nDrain my mug. To Pete: \nME Wanna do LAPD a favor tonight? \nMEG No. We're going to the Cocoanut- \n-Pete puts an extended index finger in front of Meg's lips, which she bends backwards. \nPETE 'Favor' mean `free?' \nME Means $500 an hour. \nMEG Gimme the phone so I can find another Date- \nME -you're the only Woman I know who calls Men- \nMEG -you're the only Man I know who doesn't call Women. \nPete laughs, then:                                             * \nPETE What are we doing? \n12   EXT. LOW RENT OFFICE BUILDING, EAST LA - NIGHT            12 \nMe and Junior in the car. Pete street-side, tucked into the shadows -- mimes jacking off, checks his watch. Everybody bored. Glance again at the file in my lap: \nME (V.O.) Morton Diskant, a man who preferred migrant workers to million dollar ballparks. Beating Bethune in their City Council Race despite getting outspent 10 to 1. (beat) If he wins, the Dodgers don't get a Stadium, Mexicans get to keep raising chickens two miles from City Hall and Bradley makes sure I                   * burn for Sanderline Johnson.                         * \nJunior in the backseat, penning in a steno, mouthing something to himself. \nME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Junior brought along because he begged. Already hip to how many ways you can make money with a badge. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS You got a birthday coming up. \nME -and maybe salvage something that's a close cousin to `respect.' But what about your wife and kid getting hold of those pictures? \nWait for the big futile scream/struggle. Keep waiting. Diskant just sits. No words. And now I wish he'd cry, throw punches, anything...but he doesn't. I turn to Junior: \nME (CONT'D) Take the Quiff home. \nQUIFF My name's Franklin- \nME -of course it is. \nJunior pulls Quiff out the door. By his hand. Just Pete, Me, and Diskant now. Silent moments drag sour... \nME (CONT'D) I need a nod from you Morton, let's me know you get it- \nDISKANT -don't say my name... \nPETE He gets it. \nME Someone from the Times will call for a quote. Whatever your reason for dropping out make it real. \nAs Pete and I turn to leave: \nDISKANT (not looking at us) You eventually lose the ability to reconcile the things you've done to people. That's Hell. \nA long moment on me and Pete. Blunted by what we just heard. \n14   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - NEXT MOMENT                        14 \nPete driving. Silence. Tune to an all-night Jazz signal, turn up the volume loud enough to jumble doubts. Toss Pete his cut. A $500 roll. \nPETE (pocketing the money) Y'know Hughes has a job you're tailor-made for. I already gave him your- \nME -no thanks. \nPETE Stop pretending you're not a pig for all this, Klein. \nME I still got a day job, Pete- \nPETE -tossing more Bantamweights out                       * windows? \nI wait too long, answer in too high a voice: \nME The Mutt jumped. \nPETE (laughs small, then:) Not even the people who don't know you believe that. If somebody from the DA's office decides to dig, you could fry Boy-o. Be nice to be in with a billionaire who's got a fleet of planes, fly you outta the country on a moment's notice. (beat) C'mon -- it's a cake legal gig. He                    * just wants you to burn some actress that stopped fucking him. \nStop in front of Meg's place. Pete leaves the engine running, jumps out. \nPETE (CONT'D) Tomorrow. Hughes Aircraft, 7pm                        * It'll be worth it. \nI watch Pete go into Meg's place. Drive on. Stop sign. A block away: Black Buick parallel to me. Exhaust plumes. Like they're waiting. I keep my eyes on the rear-view as I pass...but it just stays put...idling. \n15   INT. MY HOME, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - MOMENTS LATER             15 \nLights off but something grabs my eye instantly. Kitchen table: a manila envelope. 100 $100-bills. USC season tickets. A note: `Thanks for proving Flying Monkeys only live in Oz. Sam G.' Exhale. Flip to the same jazz station. Sit. Start another futile fight with sleep. \nThe last thing I see before I nod black: my War Trophy, a Japanese Officer's Samurai Sword mounted on my mantle. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n16   INT./EXT. NIGHTMARE                                            16 \nArtillery barrages from Hell: Okinawa, 1945. A hate-fueled frenzy hacking up half-starved Jap Soldiers. They dive off the Cliffs to escape me: this massive, gray-eyed Marine. \nI dive after them. Bombing toward a world below already ablaze. Falling. Gaining on a figure in a bathrobe. This guttural scream turns mechanical, like a ring as I recognize Sanderline Johnson: his pieced-together face smiling up. Snap awake. My phone ringing. 1 AM. Rip the phone from the wall:         * \nME (CONT'D) Klein- \nBRADLEY (O.S.) -you know who Hector Magdalena is? \nME (as cobwebs clear) ...yeah...Narco's Snitch. \nBRADLEY (O.S.) He's missing. His home was broken into at some point within the last hour. \nME So send Robbery. \nBRADLEY (O.C.) The only thing taken was him. Wilshire Station is on-scene. Get over there right now. \nME Why me? \nBRADLEY Call it penance. \nBIDDIE Bushes. Spyin' on Lucille. Seen him                   * there before! He's a black saboteur                   * looking for fertile white wombs. Wanna breed a mulatto master race-                    * \n-cut into the crazy: \nME Officer. \nThe Six-Pack crosses to confer. \nME (CONT'D) Besides bat-shit insanity, is there anything else about her that rings true? \nOFFICER Heard an argument, loud, maybe a minute or two, then silence. \nME What's this `Peeper' riff she's on? \nOFFICER She saw someone in the bushes earlier. She's reported that kind of thing a dozen other times. She's also reported flying saucers, so... \nME See if any of the other Neighbors can verify this `Peeper' thing.                       * \nRoam. A hallway. Junior the grim-faced professional, He's got that damn steno out, scribbling like he's on a deadline. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS No one touch a thing `til I say. \nHe's hovering over a lake of blood, drag marks originating in that lake lead out to the garage. Junior sees me. See him startle, then jut his tough-guy chin on reflex: \nJUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D) Dave- \nME -Lieutenant Klein. I said `meet me' in twenty minutes' not `go in without me.' \nJUNIOR STEMMONS All I've been doing- \nME (hard/harsh/low) -is stepping on dicks. You don't know the history, the players or the play. \nPull Junior aside, impart the following tightly: \nME (CONT'D) The Department gave Magdalena a                      * monopoly on the LA dope trade decades ago- \nJUNIOR STEMMONS -what Department? \nME Us Pollyanna -- LAPD. We bullet- proofed him in exchange for 60% of his profit and a promise he only deal drugs in Darktown and East LA-                  * \nJUNIOR STEMMONS -Black and Mexican- \nME -give the man a prize. He'd also                     * rat his competition and kill the ones we couldn't convict. Now keep your mouth shut and stay on my hip. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS                            * Fine.                                                * \nI want to bounce his head off the wall. I continue my tour instead. Follow the blood-trail out into the garage where it   * ends in another smaller lake of blood. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D)                   * Loaded him into a car- \nME -are all the Magdalena vehicles accounted for? \nJUNIOR STEMMONS Except for the Son's: Tommy.                         * \nContinue the tour. Kitchen. Two Dobermans, shot dead. Feature matching bullet wounds right between their eyes -- yell to      * the Officer with the Biddie:                                    * \nME OFFICER. \nAs he pokes his head around the corner: \nME (CONT'D) The old lady hear dogs barking?                       * Gunshots? \nOFFICER No, I asked. Just the yelling. \nExamine the wounds closer. Catch myself petting the deceased pooches. To Junior: \nME She didn't hear barking...so they were either lousy guard dogs...or they knew the Killer. (point to the wounds) You can't hit something this clean unless you're point blank. He could've been petting them when he fired: look at the burn pattern-                      * (point) Like when you shoot something with a silencer. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS How do you know that? \nME (stare so he gets it) I've shot things with silencers... And the old lady didn't hear any                      * gunshots. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS You make a family member for it? Tommy? \nME Maybe...                                              * \nJUNIOR STEMMONS Do you want to issue an APB? \nME I want to talk to Bradley first. Where are the Mother and Daughter?                   * \n19   INT. FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS                             19 \nBARTENDER Sanderline Johnson was my second                      * cousin, Peckerwood. I wouldn't                        * drink that with my gun hand. \nHe vanishes behind a stained curtain. Feel those voodoo         * stares from behind...and I switch the scotch glass to my left   * hand as nonchalant as possible. Bartender reappears, motions me back. I follow. Backstage. I see a figure stretched prone, ice-pack pressed to his face, rolled reefer between his lips. \nME (V.O.) Lester Lake. One-time velvet voiced crooner. But a dabble in the dope trade cost him a set of slashed vocal cords at the hands of none                      * other than Hector Magdalena.                          * \nOnly as I get closer do I see the badly swollen black eye. He looks up at me. A voice like sand-paper left out in the sun:    * \nLESTER LAKE Lieutenant Dave Klein. Slayer of                      * Sanderline Johnson...y'got stones                     * showing up this far South.                            * \nME What happened to your face? \nLESTER LAKE (beat) Tommy Mag wanted to make sure I understood something he was saying. \nME Where is he? \nLESTER LAKE Left an hour ago. Emptied my safe. \nME Shit. He's wise. \nLESTER LAKE To what? You looking for him? \nLester hands me the reefer, take it, toke geeky, belch smoke. \nME (at the reefer) Just never got this... \nLester takes it back, draws deep. \nLESTER LAKE Too white to appreciate good grass.                   * \nNow watch Lester's attitude improve toot sweet: \nME Hector Magdalena is missing, presumed dead. Tommy is our sole suspect. \nHe spurts smoke, sits up like a shot, beams.                    * \nLESTER LAKE Muthafucker -- there is a God. If only I'd known this an hour ago. \nME Heartbreaker, huh? You let him gig here last night? \nLESTER LAKE I don't let him, he just does. Nails on a chalkboard too. He rushed the stage last week when we had Charlie Mingus drop in for a set. Mingus looked at this half-Mex                   * greaser kid trying to play `Round                     * Midnight,' said that fool couldn't                    * find them keys with a flashlight.' \nME Tommy's playing days are over. \nLESTER LAKE Hallelujah. \nME What time did he show up? \nLESTER LAKE Around four. Him and these Pachucos         * poppin' switchblades like punks. (mops his brow of blood) The only thing that was keepin' him         * `untouched' was Hector...                   * (beat, hopeful-prayer) Is he really dead?                          * \nME There's blood all over his house, seems to belong to him. There's just no body. Not yet. \nLESTER LAKE (a toke, a thought) I don't feature Tommy for it.               * \nME (my head kinks a bit)                   * How's that? How many times has he           * been in here, busted you up? \nLESTER LAKE Yeah, but he ain't got the salt             * to truly take a Man's life.                 * Especially not Hector's...he was            * scared of him.                              * \nME                                * Why?                                        * \nLESTER LAKE                       * `Cuz Hector been whippin' Tommy's           * ass from the time he could talk.            * \nME                                * What about the Wife? Beat her too?          * \nLESTER LAKE                       * We used to call that old bitch `the         * Burglar'...eyes were so black, it           * looked like she had a mask on.              * \nME                                * And the daughter?

On top of a hill overlooking the `Atomic Vampires' shoot. Pure schlock. The spaceship: a totaled Cadillac replete with home-made canopy and cardboard extensions on the fins. Crew: homeless winos. Extras: homeless drug-fiends. Scan the assembled `talent'...and see: \nHER. My black and white picture. The Beauty at the fight. The starlet I threw a Hail Mary dinner pass to at Bethune's victory party: GLENDA BLEDSOE. Emerging from a small trailer. \nME (V.O.) Twice in a day doesn't happen. Not in a city like LA. Not like this. (beat) This is fate. This is Cupid firing his whole fucking quiver. Move. Make sure she's real. \nHER laughing. Melodic. I hike down through the bramble. \n29   EXT.

She grabs a sound blanket, drapes him, hands him her coffee before siting down next to another Woman and rehearsing. \nI eyeball the rest of the `set.'

What's her name, Mick? \n36   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT               36 \nCold for LA. Walking/scanning, .45 flush against my leg. Sticking to shadows. Cross the street: two homes down. Quiet steps. Closer: a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter... \nGlance back up at the window, Lucille gone -- a forearm shiver flashes from nowhere blunts/blasts the back of my head. Nose-first into asphalt. Too angry to black out. Spit       * blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning: \nME STOP- \nStill unsure what hit me. Pick-up my gun, clear my nose of gouting blood, stand, weave: a figure in black, sprinting away: PEEPER. Wipe away impact-tears, aim, realize my trigger   * finger is dislocated -- bent back ugly. Tuck the gun use my     * left hand to pop it back in -- deep growl -- re-aim: \nPOP-POP-POP. The Peeper pitches. Visible in the streetlight: a red puff off his right shoulder. Headlights at end of the block, behind me, come to life now- Baritone of a big V-8.      * Peeper fighting for balance, keeps running. \nI sprint heedless, round the corner: follow a blood-trail, panting, bleeding my own trail. Lift my eyes to see the Peeper shoulder through a fence, vanish into a backyard. Neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus. I cross the street- \n-those headlights swerve hard in front of me: Black Buick. I    * look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter-panel. I bounce off like someone yanked a leash. Crumble-yell. Hands pick me up. I fight back before I even see at whom I'm swinging: square-jawed types, eyes hidden by Bureau derbies.    * \nWelles Noonan gets out of the passenger-side of the Buick. Punches me as hard as he can without provocation: nothing to write home about. My gun clatters to the ground. \nWELLES NOONAN That's for Sanderline Johnson. \nME (nod at the Peeper trail) ARE YOU BLIND- \nWELLES NOONAN -what were you firing at? \nME The only lead on Magdalena -- we're after the same guy you idiot! \nWELLES NOONAN (to one of the goons) -write that name down: `Magda-LEE- na' or `Magda-LAY-na.' (back to me) No, we were after you. But thanks for the name. \nSag under the weight of my own insomnia-fed stupidity.          * \nME (V.O.) Assumed the Feds were smart. Assumed they were ready to stick a new probe into the LAPD's deal with Hector, like Bradley warned, like everyone feared. But they had no                        * clue and I just handed them the whole God damn thing. (beat) Like I said: I need sleep... \nRaise my face now, eyes intent, chin out. \nME (CONT'D) First punch you ever thrown Noonan? Your Mom have to teach you how because Dad was the same no-chin, Connecticut Faggot you are? \nNoonan stops, turns back to me: blazing. \nME (V.O.) (CONT'D) I think I hit the Noonan family dynamic, dead-on. \nHe winds up an overhand right: a big-bright flash, then           * darkness that feels like lying down on a sunlit lawn. \nFLUTTERING BLACK: \nWELLES NOONAN (O.C.) Drop him. \nDERBY #1 (O.C.) You don't want to take him in? \nWELLES NOONAN (O.C.) I only want to bring him in when I know he'll never leave. \nBLACK dissolves to something LIGHTER, then: \n37   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - TIME UNKNOWN                       37 \nHorizontal. Someone pushed a table and two chairs to one side: space for the cot I'm on. Look up. Junior looking down: `Concerned' isn't strong enough. In his undershirt. He slips the red steno pad into his back pocket. Sit up. A balled dress shirt in my hand, blood sopped. \nGaze at my Hamilton, face cracked, `5:16am'-- Fritz Koenig walks in, silver pitcher in hand. I gape up, still punchy. \nME Coffee? \nKOENIG Ice. Bradley's on his way down. \nToss the dress shirt to the floor. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS That's mine...you needed some                        * mopping up. \nME Who found me? \nJUNIOR STEMMONS I did. I got there at eleven like you said, right as two black & white's pulled up: you were out                      * cold in a gutter `round the block.                   * (this blithe little grin) Did Noonan knock you out? \nME He hit me with his car first. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS (a nod to Koenig) The Captain was the only one here at this hour...                                      * \nLook from Junior and Koenig to the window behind him -- Bradley steam-rolling our way. To Koenig, conspiratorial:      * \nKLEIN If I need your help later on, can I count on it? \nKOENIG Of course you can. \nTake the pitcher from him, drop my head, douse myself, the cold cuts cobwebs. Bradley walks in, imperious. Koenig moves past -- ice forms between the two.                             * \nME Seltzer will take the blood out. \nJunior bitchy, like some broad you stood up: \nJUNIOR STEMMONS I give you the shirt off my back                        * and you bash me!                                        * \nME When a Superior Officer tells you to leave the room, you leave the                        * fucking room.                                           * \nJunior balls the shirt, stuffs it in his desk drawer. Takes a     * deep breath.                                                      * \nJUNIOR STEMMONS I made a file on the Bledsoe broad. The one you asked about. \nME Thanks. But forget it. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS I spent a whole day putting it together and this skirt's got skeletons. \nReminded, glance at my hand: \"A I N G E\" in smeared ink. Junior rips open a file, blathers Bledsoe preliminaries: \nJUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D) Shoplifting in Bakersfield at 17. Prostitution arrest at 21. Known associate of a Kern County homicide victim, this convicted pimp named Dwight Gillette, probably her pimp. Stabbed to death in his home, weapon never recovered- \nME Forget it. Burn it, s'not important now. \nTake the file from him, flip through; thorough, detailed. Glenda priors scream back instant conviction. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS Why is it not important? \nPlant the file in his chest as my answer. \nME I need an address on a guy named Ainge, George Ainge-                                    * \nJUNIOR STEMMONS -what about Magdalena? \nMy temper turning threadbare. \nME -after you get the Ainge address,                       * get back to the Magda- \nJUNIOR STEMMONS (picks up Glenda's file) -is Ainge related to this Cunt? \nSnap-grit-grab him: buttons from his shirt pop, bounce. \nME We're partners in name only. You want to stay in the room next time, Junior? Do something to impress me: like finding that address. \nDig Junior trying to hide tears now behind that mad-dog glare: makes me want to break the bones in his face. \n39   INT. MY 1955 PONTIAC - MORNING                               39 \nDriving, running parallels to avoid Fed tails. No Black Buicks...But a Gray Packard shifts behind me on a cadence.        * \nME (V.O.) Noonan replaced the Buick with a                        * Packard and a better Shadow-Man.                        * But I could still spot the tail.                        * \nRun a red light at Rossmore, leave the Packard behind.            * \nME (V.O.) (CONT'D) This jet-engine urge to see her. Needing it like a junkie does. No logic. Just the push. \nDriving past Glenda's house now. No Corvette. Driving past      * the Griffith Park `Vampires' set: addicts/crew rolling up sleeping bags. No Corvette. Pull the address list Dandy handed me: Talent Domiciles. \nPasadena. Howard's Fuck-Pad supreme: A tudor mansion with airplane-shaped hedges. A Corvette in the drive. Stop at the curb. Open shades. Flashes of her. Gathering something. Check my Hamilton, look up as: KNOCK-KNOCK on my window. Her face, inches-close. Bags of groceries in her hands and this wry little smile: watch me kill Hughes's new Dick with kindness.    * \nRoll the window down, stay blank-slate. She features my cuts/bruises. Her quiet, deep voice is like medicine: \nGLENDA BLEDSOE Better looking than the last guy Howard hired. Once you heal. (she recognizes me) Wait a minute. You were there, the other night, the Bethune Party...                     * \nMy heart jammed up into my throat.

Told me to be careful. So you're LAPD after all... \nME In theory. \nGLENDA BLEDSOE You're going to arrest me for breaking and entering? \nME Depends. (nod to groceries) Those Howard's? \nGLENDA BLEDSOE Everything's Howard's. \nME Except you. \nGLENDA BLEDSOE That's why I left. \nME You just shop here now? \nME (CONT'D)                               * (at the door)                                   * FUCK OFF.                                           * \nWilhite tries to push past.

Light jazz on the radio gives way to the news:                * \nANNOUNCER                                     * -KGFJ news at the top of the hour.                      * U.S. Attorney Welles Noonan today                       * announced his intention to probe                        * what he called `widespread                              * corruption' within the Los Angeles                      * Police Department and promised an                       * equally widespread round of                             * criminal indictments before-                            * \n-click it off.

MY HOME, HOLLYWOOD HILLS - A.M.                        71   * \nRounding the corner -- break hard: those same process servers leaning on my doorbell now. \nME Bradley trying to bury me too. That subpoena means my fifteen year career with the LAPD just went up in smoke. \nContinue past. Those Process Geeks keep buzzing my doorbell. \n72   INT. BREAKFAST JOINT PAY-PHONE - MORNING                    72 \nDrop dimes. Dial Pete. \nME Hey- \nPETE (O.S.) -Junior's left the fucking planet. \nME You find him? \nPETE Yeah. I swung by his apartment, car was out front. I scoped it: a sawed- off shotgun in front, canned tuna in the back seat. Think he's living outta that car. After he left, I tried to get inside his place: The front door is triple pad-locked. \nME (out loud) That knife is in there- \nPETE -the what? \nShit. Ignore it, maybe Pete will too. \nME Meet me down the street from his place. You got bolt cutters? \nPETE I'll bring `em. \nME Thirty minutes. \n73   EXT. APARTMENT COMPLEX - DAY                              73 \nJunior's stucco-beige apartment building looms a block up. Cursory checks of the rear and side-view mirrors. Sans tail as I pull the Powerhawk in behind Pete's Caddy. Step out, sidle up driver's side. \nPETE Who's car is that? \nME Long story. \nPETE Junior looked real skeezed this morning. Like he was on a dope jag. \nME Yeah? \nPETE Sweated up like a stuck pig. And be careful. He was fucking around with his front door before he left. I don't know what he was doing. \nME Two honks if he shows. Then meet me in the alley, back of his place. \nPETE (handing me bolt-cutters) What about this Bledsoe broad? Milteer has called me twice. \nME (taking the bolt-cutters) One thing at a time pal. \n74   EXT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY                    74 \nHustle across the street. Hang my badge over my shirt-pocket. \n75   INT. JUNIOR'S APARTMENT BUILDING - MOMENTS LATER          75 \nUp three flights. Junior: #303: three padlocks:hinge/receiver hardware extending between door and jamb. Three kicks and a shoulder to splinter the door. Stop, look: Some kind of twine stretched taut, just inside the door...trip-wire. Pull my pig- sticker, extend it between door and jamb...see the twine stretching tighter -- flick the blade, snag twine, slice it. \nStand. Put my boot into the door full. Snaps at the hinges. \n76   INT. APT. 303 - NEXT MOMENT                               76 \nMove slow. Examine close: Eye-bolt pulley system, jerry- rigged around the door. Severed twine attached to the trigger of a shotgun taped atop a jello mold at knee level. \nContinue to look around. Sex-horror grimace: like catching Pop fingering Mom. Junior's place a tiny, filthy one bedroom. \nME (V.O.) Junior the Insane: You couldn't hide what he was hiding in 1958 LA, and not have it rot your mind. \nBear traps barely hidden under sheets. Rat-traps garnished with razor blades across the floor. Smell rotten flowers: his shirt that I wore/bled-on crumpled on his pillow -- yellowed jizz stains cover black blood stains. Stifle a gag. \nCard table: an empty green-banded evidence bag. Gape at it. Then walk over, read the abstracts: 1284 South Tremaine. \nGLENDA BLEDSOE Or desperation. Depends on the day. \nThe laughter ebbs, her eyes still shine. \nGLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D) I'll get there though. (beat) I'll get there. \nI let the silence take...try not to shatter it with: \nME Dwight Gillette. \nShe doesn't blanch. \nGLENDA BLEDSOE He asked me to take his `niece and nephew' to their cousin in Oxnard. These beautiful, funny little kids. (tears she doesn't swipe) I dropped them off. Didn't ask any questions -- I believed Dwight. A week later I saw their pictures in the Post Office. A week after that their little bodies came in on the tide near San Pedro. (beat, tears stream) I'll never shake the thought that maybe those poor kids thought I was part of it. That I knew what was going to happen to them. So I pray to God that he let them look in when I put that knife into Dwight. (beat) But I'll never ask his forgiveness for doing it... (beat, clears her eyes) Why do they call you `Enforcer?' \nShe actually gets closer, I can feel her breath on me. \nME I've killed 44 men. \nShe blanches, but never blinks...never takes her eyes away from mine. \nME (CONT'D) 33 for War. 2 for principle. 9 for profit -- mostly. Why did you sign with Hughes, knowing what he was? \nGLENDA BLEDSOE `For profit -- mostly.' \nSilence. A feeling like: `and there we are...' \nME I'm not much good. \nGLENDA BLEDSOE Me neither. \nShe touches my quake. Two breaths with her hand on mine and it all goes quiet: the shakes, the images, the fear. She takes my head, pulls me to her bare breasts. The only things audible: my breathing, a clock ticking. Both slowly fade out. \nBLACK. \nWake up quiet, look at my Hamilton. 6 AM. Sit up slow. \nLook back at her, sleeping, just stare. I lean down, kiss her lightly, her taste lingers, inhale her, hold that...it's the last good thing you'll get today. \n88   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - EARLY A.M.                                88 \nDark. Stay quiet. Maneuver into the kitchen. Turn on a light. On the table: safe open, it's contents laid-out neatly, short- stacks of files, $1000 in twenties. I sit, start searching for something else...Pete's voice behind me: \nPETE (O.C.) The Knife ain't there. File on top of that middle pile: George Ainge in an `undisclosed locale.' \nI don't turn. Pete sits next to me. Sets a shotgun down. \nPETE Junior documented everything like a fucking Monk. (pulls a file) Like here: `has evidence' you murdered Sanderline Johnson. (MORE) \nPETE (cont'd) Kept track of `suspected contract killings' you pulled for the mob. \nLook at Pete. Dark rings, deathbed eyes. \nME You been up all night? \nPETE In-case Stemmons made a house-call. He's got every goddamn address of everybody you know... (beat, hard) And you should've told me about the Bledsoe broad. \nME There's nothing to tell. \nFeature Pete, righteously pissed: \nPETE Then call Milteer about this dead Pimp Gillette. I'm no legal mind like you, but I'll bet a murder beef would violate her morals clause quick. (beat, hands phone) Collect the rest of your money. \nME I don't want it anymore. \nPETE Then give that five grand back. \nME Junior stole it. \nPete pauses, scoffs, turns back toward Meg's bedroom walks: \nPETE People are gonna start lining-up to see you bleed, Pal. \nDoor closes. I flip through Junior's files: the same architect-neat block printing. Find a Glenda entry: \nSUBSEQUENT TO HER FATAL STABBING OF DWIGHT Gillette, MISS BLEDSOE SECRETED THE MURDER WEAPON WITH GEORGE AINGE. I HAVE ACQUIRED THIS KNIFE. IT IS A SIX-INCH BLADE WITH A MOTHER-OF-PEARL GRIP WHICH SUSTAINED RIGHT THUMB AND RIGHT INDEX PRINTS WHICH MATCH ELEVEN COMPARISON POINTS TO FINGERPRINTS ON FILE FROM MISS BLEDSOE'S 1946 JUVENILE SHOPLIFTING ARREST. \nShred it. Grab another file. Hyper-detailed: subscript clarifications, attachments, pictures, procedural notes to the U.S.A.W.N.: United States Attorney Welles Noonan. \nThen I see the tab of the file furthest down: BOYCE BRADLEY. Open it: Noonan's business card stapled to the front cover. Flip forward. Scan. See Bradley's name, finger tracks across a page. A company name: `HURWITZ HOLDINGS' \nI read it all...and feel my jaw slowly unhinge... \nAll Bradley can muster is: \nBRADLEY How? \nME Junior Stemmons. The ex-evidence teacher. His `excellent ratings' didn't stop him from stealing the Magdalena seizure and doing his own investigation. \nBRADLEY Why would he investigate me? \nHand him Noonan's business card: dig the big Federal Eagle in American Blue. \nME That was stapled to the cover. (beat) Why would Noonan worry about a Turd like me now...when a high profile target like you can be taken down. \nSilence. I smile wide at it. Bradley, scrambling. \nBRADLEY Where is Stemmons? \nME No idea. If you haven't spoken to Internal Affairs today, I'm sure they've called. Junior's apartment caught fire. Deeply deviant material inside. Round him up- (my angle) -and anyone he's got with him. \nBradley readjusts his glasses. \nBRADLEY I'll issue an A.P.B. saying Stemmons is a known deviant targeting kindergarten children. \nME Now, quid pro quo...you subpoenaed Wilhite too. \nBradley's reaction: Feature the angler getting angled. \nBRADLEY How do y- \nME -don't worry `how.' Why? \nBradley says nothing. Then, like a klieg-light, it hits me. \nME (CONT'D) You're going after Narco yourself. \nBRADLEY Exposing the corrupt parts of the LAPD will redeem the whole. I'll prove that Police can police themselves- \nME -so you show-up Noonan...co-opt his crusade and condemn your own before he can...Jesus Christ can you turn lemons to lemonade. \nBRADLEY No Cop will testify against other Cops. This is why Wilhite has suddenly disappeared. \nME And how. (beat) So where do we go now Chief? \nBRADLEY (beat, eyes flick again to the files I'm holding...) There are other forces at work here...faces we need to identify. Names we need to know. A third party. (MORE) \nBRADLEY (cont'd) Find out who Klein and I'll reinstate you, rescind that subpoena & burn the coroner's report on Sanderline- \nME -that report is only useful to Noonan now. \nBRADLEY No. It ensures our mutual destruction should you choose to share the contents of that Stemmons file. Which I know you won't do until you figure out how it will best benefit you. \nHe walks off, imperious, impervious, gets engulfed by the press ranks once again. \nME (V.O.) A mistake to underestimate me now Chief. The price to keep your secrets is steep...and you're going to pay up. Soon. \nBack to the Powerhawk, fresh-scrubbed six-packs standing near it, the trunk stink ripe past the point of concealment. They see me, deferential nods. One squeaky wheel offers: \nSIX-PACK Something in your trunk smells to high hell Lieutenant. \nME Dead body. \nLaughter. Easily amused academy types. Brush by grinning, give `em an \"Enforcer\" story to tell the other rookies. I jump in the Powerhawk and tear off. \nME (V.O.) (CONT'D) Borrowed time burning fast. My days are done. Only hours remain. Whatever moves I have left...make them now. \n91   INT. MEG'S HOUSE - LATER                                     91 \nGoing through files. Filling my own steno pad with scrawl. Pete walks in from the garage, face bunched up, bit-lemon. \nPETE Fucking Christ. You can't keep that car in the garage, the smell's coming into the house. \nMeg wanders in, dressed for work. \nMEG Open the windows. \nPETE That's not gonna help. \nME (still scribbling) Take a couple bottles of bleach, pour it over the trunk. \nPETE What do you got in there? \nME My foreseeable future. \n92   INTERCUT:                                                  92 \nGLENDA Who were you talking- \nME -no, no. It's nothing. I had a phone call, just before yours. \nA beat. Glenda in a chaise lounge on a small deck overlooking the canyon. She sits up. \nGLENDA Was it him? The Cop you were telling me about? \nME I don't want you to worry. I'm handling it. But I might send my friend Pete out there. \nGLENDA You don't think it's safe? \nME I'd just rather have someone there with you. \nGLENDA I wish you would've woken me up this morning. \nME I'm better-looking in low light, I didn't want to blow it for myself. \nShe laughs. Makes me smile despite my world caving-in... \nME (CONT'D) Stay by the phone. \nGLENDA I miss you. \nAnd I melt. Love-struck at possibly the worst fucking moment of my life. Hang up before your voice breaks. Grab a pen, scrawl for Pete, post it on the fridge magnet: `PETE: 655 TOPANGA. STAY WITH HER. PLEASE.' \n93   EXT. FERN DELL PARK - EVENING                             93 \nRolling green. Half-dirt, half-asphalt path. I scan for any back-up. Nothing. Junior already there. Astride like Gary Cooper. His eyes bloodshot from here. My gun riding quick- draw style. The heft feels good. Unbutton my coat to show him the file as I approach, tucked right behind my .45. \nME Where's the knife. \nJunior, this evil little curl. He turns. Follow him over a small knoll: that Gray Packard, waiting. A silhouette behind the wheel. As we near it the lights come on, blind me. \nME Turn your lights off...and just come out and talk to me...Fritz. \nA pause in the car, Junior looks at me like I'm Rasputin, divining answers from the marine-layer moving-in over LA. The lights pop off and I hear a tired laugh coming from the car that we've all heard before. \nME (V.O.) Third Party Confirmed...I fucking knew it. \nFritz Koenig steps out of the Packard. \nKOENIG Not much with these sub-rosa things... \nME (a nod to the Packard) I thought it was Noonan tailing me. \nKOENIG Bradley's greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side. \nJunior, jumpy in my periphery. I don't like it. \nME (CONT'D) Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not Narco. \nKOENIG When did you know? \nME I didn't. I had a feeling. I smelled cover-up all over Hector's disappearance and Wilhite wouldn't have the muscle or the mind-set to kingpin something that big by himself...you knew about Bradley trying to buy him out? \nKOENIG He was offering to exonerate Hector and clear his criminal record. Hector met with Wilhite and I to inform us of his decision... \nFLASHBACK TO: \n94   INT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - PAST                                94 \nFor the first and only time, WE SEE Hector Magdalena, alive and well...for the moment...speaking to Koenig and Wilhite. \nKOENIG (V.O.) ...to accept Bradley's deal... \nKoenig pets Hector's twin Doberman guard dogs. \nKOENIG (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and although the terms of that deal worked well for him. I found them less than favorable... \nKoenig draws a silenced pistol and shoots both dogs before shooting a shocked Hector twice in the chest. Wilhite staggers to his feet as Koenig steps over and delivers the coup de grace head-shot to Hector. \nKOENIG Darktown. Chavez Ravine. Hot Spots for Human Vice. These are slums I run & profit from. If these slums suddenly become Stadiums, that profit goes elsewhere...that crime goes elsewhere. \nME Bradley...you two got greed in common. \nKoenig grins. Junior keeps shifting. Dying to shoot him dead. \nME You knew about Wilhite and Lucille. That's how you were operating him. \nBRADLEY Things like? \nME Stemmons files...and Wilhite's body. He committed suicide after you subpoenaed him. \nBRADLEY This body is in your possession? \nJust nod. \nME And it's what you need to burn Narco to the ground...but if those files and his body were to be given to Noonan and the Feds, with me providing the cherry-on-top testimony of a rogue cop. Well. The word `Cataclysmic' comes to mind. \nBRADLEY What will this cost? \nME A percentage of your Dodger Stadium stake in perpetuity. You buy my silence for a fourth of Hurwitz Holdings. \nBradley scoffs, pithy smile. \nBRADLEY Doubtful. \nME What'd you expect? A stick-up? Empty your safe? I'm about to disappear for good, and you're gonna fund my new life. You can't counter-punch out of this. Arrest me and I snitch the world. (point to the file) I'll hold that over your head for the rest of your life. Renege on our deal and it won't matter if it's tomorrow or ten years from now...I'll fry you with that file. (at my cracked Hamilton) I'm officially outta time now Chief. Call it. \nBradley: an actual, full-blown facial tic. His Adam's apple bobs as he realizes that he's finally been beaten. \nBRADLEY Wilhite's body...Bury it. \n97   INT. PETE'S CADILLAC - MORNING                               97 \nCruising up the Topanga Canyon. Almost home... \nME (V.O.) Shaking to see her, touch her... \n98   EXT. BUNGALOW - MORNING                                      98 \nDoor locked. Knocking. Pete opens up. Standing drunk. A pissed-off nod. \n99   INT. BUNGALOW - NEXT MOMENT                                  99 \nLiquor wafts off of him. \nME You go to bed drunk, or just been up all night. \nNo answer as I follow him into the house. \nKLEIN Where's Glenda, is she asle- \n-round the corner: Glenda shaking but refusing to cry. I go pale: what is this? Somebody to the left, look: Milteer. Look back at Pete: tears in his bleary eyes as he crushes me with a right cross. \nME (V.O.) Seen Pete do this a dozen times and every time the same thought: God help me if he ever hits me like that... \nInstant-drop, moan. Glenda screaming. \nME (CONT'D) Don't kill me. \nPete looks to Milteer, wipes blurred eyes. \nMILTEER The harder you hit him the quicker I say `stop' -- and cease that absurd crying. \nPete bludgeons me. I try to get closer to Glenda. Feel my nose shatter. Another swing: right cheek detonates. A left hook to take advantage of my momentum: left eye explodes. Glenda's crying/screaming gets me madder than anything. \nGLENDA BLEDSOE (at Milteer) THAT IMPOTENT SHIT- \nMILTEER -touch me and he dies. \nPete knocks me down again. My face in pieces. \nMILTEER (CONT'D) Kick him-kick him-kick him. \nPete hesitates, puts his boot into my guts: 1, 2, 3- \nMILTEER (CONT'D) (prim, official) -you may stop. (beat, for the room) Howard determined that this was the price for your time together. \nMilteer produces a Polaroid, takes a snapshot of my shattered husk, hands the camera to Pete on his way out: \nMILTEER You still have a job. \nMilteer gone. I spit volumes of blood. I'll talk with a slur for the next year. Pete reaches for me, blotto, sobbing. \nPETE ...I'm sorry Dave... \nPushing out words past shattered teeth. \nME I put you here...that Powerhawk- \n", "test1_input": "BRADLEY -no. We can't risk that. Do you             * make him for the murderer? \nME Yeah. Hector's disappearance is definitely an inside job. That whole family feels hinky. The daughter was all bruises and no tears and Hector's hop-head wife            * looks part punching bag. \nBRADLEY Do you suspect either of the women?         * \nME According to Wilhite, they were in Santa Barbara at the time. \nBRADLEY Verify that. Where is your partner? \nME Vouching in evidence at Wilshire Station. \nBRADLEY Keep him on that. He had excellent ratings as an evidence teacher and          * I trust him more than you. (beat) Find Tommy Magdalena. Focus everything on that effort & I want him apprehended Klein, not killed. \nME What about Hector? Still missing. \nBRADLEY And most likely dead. Find the Son.         * Stakeout the residence. Put tails on both the mother and daughter -- I want this investigation working quietly, and around the clock. \nME                                * And what do we do if Hector turns           * up?                                         * \nBRADLEY                                    * If he's alive, bring him to me.

He was operating Hector- \nBRADLEY -don't worry about Dan Wilhite. You deal directly with me. Now go out the back. I don't want the press recognizing you. \nSwallow my sneer. Push through the service doors. Hard. Headed back toward the kitchen, an exit sign. I pass an alcove: Her. Alone. Smoke break. Beauty you almost never get to examine up close. I stop, stammer, she gives me a once- over, thinks I'm a Reporter... \nME You got a light? \nWOMAN (searches my empty hands) You got a cigarette? \nI fumble for a Chesterfield. She pulls a Zippo slow. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) If you snap a picture of me, I get to set you on fire. Fair? \nI smile too wide -- fuck. I kill it, try to gather up the bits of `cool' that shattered with the sophomore smile. \nME It didn't look like you were all that upset with the attention. \nWOMAN Good thing you're not a cop. \nME (beat) How's that? \nWOMAN Your power of observation leaves lots to be desired. \nLights my cigarette. I hold it in my mouth to hide shaking hands. \nME Thank you. \nWOMAN Don't thank me: these things are bad for you. \nME You believe everything you read? \nStubs her cigarette. \nWOMAN You believe anything you read? \nShe starts walking back the way I came. \nME (hail-mary) Do you eat Dinner? \nWOMAN No. \nI can't stop watching her, even after she pushes back through the double doors, re-entering the fray head-first.

Tell me where Stemmons' files are. \nME I'll bring them to you. \nWELLES NOONAN You're not leaving here Klein. \nME Then like I said: you only get me. \nNoonan stands, firm: \nWELLES NOONAN I'll take it. \nOn his way out I speak fast -- the last ace in my deck: \nME I give you the body of Dan Wilhite, head of LAPD's Narcotics Division. Proof of a 20-year criminal collusion between his department and Hector Magdalena and my testimony to link the dots. (beat, make him believe) Then I leave LA for good. \nNoonan at the door: please bite-please bite...but he just smirks, walks out. Real panic now: no ideas on what comes next. 15 seconds. Door opens again: one of Noonan's deputies pushes a sheet. Scan it: Federal Witness Agreement. Noonan back: two cups of coffee. Read it over. \nWELLES NOONAN What happened to Wilhite? \nME Suicide. \nWELLES NOONAN Like Sanderline Johnson? \nIgnore him. Sign the agreement. \nWELLES NOONAN (CONT'D) Get me Stemmons files and Wilhite's body by noon tomorrow. \nGulp the coffee back, the burn feels good. \nME No more tails. I don't want anyone else incriminated. \nWELLES NOONAN Agreed. \nME (nod to agreement) I get a copy of that? \nWELLES NOONAN After a judge signs it. Now Leave. \nStand-nod-take my coffee-leave. Door closes. Noonan shreds the Witness agreement. Tosses it in the trash. Off the baffled Deputy. \nWELLES NOONAN (CONT'D) We wait for him to deliver, then we arrest him. You never saw that agreement. \nDEPUTY #1 Tail him? \nWELLES NOONAN No. Let him get comfortable...let him believe me. \n83   INT. CAB - NIGHT                                             83 \nBackseat. Suborned Cabby driving fast. LAPD on board. \n", "test3_true": "Jump out of the cab, into Wilhite's Powerhawk. Slide in, slam the door. \n84   INT. MEG'S PLACE - LATER                                     84 \nBust in shaking. Teeth chatter like I'm freezing. Pete in the garage adjacent the kitchen, welder's goggles and a power drill, punching holes in Junior's safe. \nPETE I know what Feds look like -- those were Feds with Junior... \nME Yeah and they made me leaving the scene. Had to barter out. \nPETE Barter what? \nME My Testimony. I signed a Federal Witness Agreement. \nPete drops the drill. \nPETE You what? \nME It's bullshit. Noonan's got no intention of honoring it. (beat) They want Stemmons files though. I think Junior's been working angles for awhile, doing his own investigations. \nPETE What did you do to his place? Nice quiet neighborhood one minute, Nagasaki the next. \nME (point to safe) He had a hand grenade tied to that. (as Pete resumes drilling) How much longer do you need? \nPETE Few more hours. Maybe. Junior didn't skimp on this thing. I gotta bore right through the face plate. (beat) You got some time now, why don't you get Milteer off my back and go work that Bledsoe broad. \nME You read my mind. \n85   EXT. TOPANGA CANYON BUNGALOW - NIGHT                      85 \nPull in. Glenda's Vette parked behind. Lights on low inside. \n86   EXT./INT. BUNGALOW - MOMENTS LATER                        86 \nThe door opens. She's dressed for bed. I don't hesitate, afraid she'll shun me. Move to her, she doesn't startle. An arm around her waist, drawing her in, my mouth close to hers. \nI take her face in my hand, check her eyes, a beat before they tell me it's okay...I lean in, takes a lifetime...and kiss her soft until she kisses back, her mouth moving over my split lips, she puts her hands on my face, pulling me in. \nShe feels exactly like I imagined. \nMy coat comes off. Her camisole follows. We're moving toward a bed in back. I stop, pull back, the moonlight moves over her shoulders. I whisper: \nME ...tell me if I'm being too rough. \nTears squeezed through smiling eyes, she kisses me even harder, pulls me down to her. We make love like we've never touched another. Everything blurs, burns down: Bradley. Wilhite. Tommy. Hector Junior. Ainge. She takes it all away. I escape into her. Hours fall. I could stay here forever... \n87   INT. BEDROOM - LATER                                      87 \nLying there, staring at her. A silence and peace I've never known. Not once. \nME Tell me anything. Tell me everything. \nLabel her surprise, her brow that furrows and unfurrows just as quickly. A long moment as she waivers...commits: \nGLENDA BLEDSOE Where would I start? \nME Why here? \nGLENDA BLEDSOE Why L.A.? (this amazing smile) Why is anybody here? Want the rest of the world to know who they are. \nME You? \nGLENDA BLEDSOE No...I don't think so. (beat) I just love it. I grew up in Seattle. My aunt, every week, she'd take me to the movies. \nMe watching her...tucks her hair back over his shoulders. \nGLENDA BLEDSOE (CONT'D)                     * The idea that you can outlive yourself...that a part of you goes on, long after you're gone. (beat, grins) Sounds silly doesn't it? `Attack of the Atomic Vampires' being- \nME -your ticket to immortality? \nMake her laugh. Swear a thousand silent oaths to protect her. He face slowly goes dark. \nGLENDA BLEDSOE Hughes told me he could get me in for this screen test two years ago. Movie with Gregory Peck at Universal. He thought he was humoring me...until I got it. They offered me the role...there in the room. So Howard, who I'm sure never thought in a million years I'd land that part, makes some phone calls and just like that they don't want me anymore. (beat) Nobody calls now. I can't get in to see any studio casting people. He's ruined me in those circles. \nME And you still want it- \nGLENDA BLEDSOE -bad enough to put on a silly cheerleading skirt and try to make the most god-awful dialogue sound decent. \nME Surrounded by winos in werewolf suits. (she laughs, I laugh) That's...dedication. \n"}

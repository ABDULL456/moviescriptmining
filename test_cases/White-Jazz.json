{"test1_input": "36   EXT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE, NEIGHBORHOOD - NIGHT               36 \nCold for LA. Walking/scanning, .45 flush against my leg. Sticking to shadows. Cross the street: two homes down. Quiet steps. Closer: a snubbed cigarette smoulders in the gutter... \nGlance back up at the window, Lucille gone -- a forearm shiver flashes from nowhere blunts/blasts the back of my head. Nose-first into asphalt. Too angry to black out. Spit       * blood and scream at the same time so it sounds like drowning: \nME STOP- \nStill unsure what hit me. Pick-up my gun, clear my nose of gouting blood, stand, weave: a figure in black, sprinting away: PEEPER. Wipe away impact-tears, aim, realize my trigger   * finger is dislocated -- bent back ugly. Tuck the gun use my     * left hand to pop it back in -- deep growl -- re-aim: \nPOP-POP-POP. The Peeper pitches. Visible in the streetlight: a red puff off his right shoulder. Headlights at end of the block, behind me, come to life now- Baritone of a big V-8.      * Peeper fighting for balance, keeps running. \nI sprint heedless, round the corner: follow a blood-trail, panting, bleeding my own trail. Lift my eyes to see the Peeper shoulder through a fence, vanish into a backyard. Neighborhood mutts yelp a chorus. I cross the street- \n-those headlights swerve hard in front of me: Black Buick. I    * look down in time to watch my knee detonate a quarter-panel. I bounce off like someone yanked a leash. Crumble-yell. Hands pick me up. I fight back before I even see at whom I'm swinging: square-jawed types, eyes hidden by Bureau derbies.    * \nWelles Noonan gets out of the passenger-side of the Buick. Punches me as hard as he can without provocation: nothing to write home about. My gun clatters to the ground. \nWELLES NOONAN That's for Sanderline Johnson. \nME (nod at the Peeper trail) ARE YOU BLIND- \nWELLES NOONAN -what were you firing at? \nME The only lead on Magdalena -- we're after the same guy you idiot! \nWELLES NOONAN (to one of the goons) -write that name down: `Magda-LEE- na' or `Magda-LAY-na.' (back to me) No, we were after you. But thanks for the name. \nSag under the weight of my own insomnia-fed stupidity.          * \nME (V.O.) Assumed the Feds were smart. Assumed they were ready to stick a new probe into the LAPD's deal with Hector, like Bradley warned, like everyone feared. But they had no                        * clue and I just handed them the whole God damn thing. (beat) Like I said: I need sleep... \nRaise my face now, eyes intent, chin out. \nME (CONT'D) First punch you ever thrown Noonan? Your Mom have to teach you how because Dad was the same no-chin, Connecticut Faggot you are? \nNoonan stops, turns back to me: blazing. \nME (V.O.) (CONT'D) I think I hit the Noonan family dynamic, dead-on. \nHe winds up an overhand right: a big-bright flash, then           * darkness that feels like lying down on a sunlit lawn. \nFLUTTERING BLACK: \nWELLES NOONAN (O.C.) Drop him. \nDERBY #1 (O.C.) You don't want to take him in? \nWELLES NOONAN (O.C.) I only want to bring him in when I know he'll never leave. \nBLACK dissolves to something LIGHTER, then: \n37   INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - TIME UNKNOWN                       37 \nHorizontal. Someone pushed a table and two chairs to one side: space for the cot I'm on. Look up. Junior looking down: `Concerned' isn't strong enough. In his undershirt. He slips the red steno pad into his back pocket. Sit up. A balled dress shirt in my hand, blood sopped. \nGaze at my Hamilton, face cracked, `5:16am'-- Fritz Koenig walks in, silver pitcher in hand. I gape up, still punchy. \nME Coffee? \nKOENIG Ice. Bradley's on his way down. \nToss the dress shirt to the floor. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS That's mine...you needed some                        * mopping up. \nME Who found me? \nJUNIOR STEMMONS I did. I got there at eleven like you said, right as two black & white's pulled up: you were out                      * cold in a gutter `round the block.                   * (this blithe little grin) Did Noonan knock you out? \nME He hit me with his car first. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS (a nod to Koenig) The Captain was the only one here at this hour...                                      * \nLook from Junior and Koenig to the window behind him -- Bradley steam-rolling our way. To Koenig, conspiratorial:      * \nKLEIN If I need your help later on, can I count on it? \nKOENIG Of course you can. \nTake the pitcher from him, drop my head, douse myself, the cold cuts cobwebs.

It's nothing. I had a phone call, just before yours. \nA beat. Glenda in a chaise lounge on a small deck overlooking the canyon. She sits up. \nGLENDA Was it him? The Cop you were telling me about? \nME I don't want you to worry. I'm handling it. But I might send my friend Pete out there. \nGLENDA You don't think it's safe? \nME I'd just rather have someone there with you. \nGLENDA I wish you would've woken me up this morning. \nME I'm better-looking in low light, I didn't want to blow it for myself. \nShe laughs. Makes me smile despite my world caving-in... \nME (CONT'D) Stay by the phone. \nGLENDA I miss you. \nAnd I melt. Love-struck at possibly the worst fucking moment of my life. Hang up before your voice breaks. Grab a pen, scrawl for Pete, post it on the fridge magnet: `PETE: 655 TOPANGA. STAY WITH HER. PLEASE.' \n93   EXT. FERN DELL PARK - EVENING                             93 \nRolling green. Half-dirt, half-asphalt path. I scan for any back-up. Nothing. Junior already there. Astride like Gary Cooper. His eyes bloodshot from here. My gun riding quick- draw style. The heft feels good. Unbutton my coat to show him the file as I approach, tucked right behind my .45. \nME Where's the knife. \nJunior, this evil little curl. He turns. Follow him over a small knoll: that Gray Packard, waiting. A silhouette behind the wheel. As we near it the lights come on, blind me. \nME Turn your lights off...and just come out and talk to me...Fritz. \nA pause in the car, Junior looks at me like I'm Rasputin, divining answers from the marine-layer moving-in over LA. The lights pop off and I hear a tired laugh coming from the car that we've all heard before. \nME (V.O.) Third Party Confirmed...I fucking knew it. \nFritz Koenig steps out of the Packard. \nKOENIG Not much with these sub-rosa things... \nME (a nod to the Packard) I thought it was Noonan tailing me. \nKOENIG Bradley's greatest stroke was enlisting you to his side. \nJunior, jumpy in my periphery. I don't like it. \nME (CONT'D) Wilhite ran Magdalena for you, not Narco. \nKOENIG When did you know? \nME I didn't. I had a feeling. I smelled cover-up all over Hector's disappearance and Wilhite wouldn't have the muscle or the mind-set to kingpin something that big by himself...you knew about Bradley trying to buy him out? \nKOENIG He was offering to exonerate Hector and clear his criminal record. Hector met with Wilhite and I to inform us of his decision... \nFLASHBACK TO: \n94   INT. 1284 SOUTH TREMAINE - PAST                                94 \nFor the first and only time, WE SEE Hector Magdalena, alive and well...for the moment...speaking to Koenig and Wilhite. \nKOENIG (V.O.) ...to accept Bradley's deal... \nKoenig pets Hector's twin Doberman guard dogs. \nKOENIG (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...and although the terms of that deal worked well for him. I found them less than favorable... \nKoenig draws a silenced pistol and shoots both dogs before shooting a shocked Hector twice in the chest. Wilhite staggers to his feet as Koenig steps over and delivers the coup de grace head-shot to Hector. \nKOENIG Darktown. Chavez Ravine. Hot Spots for Human Vice. These are slums I run & profit from. If these slums suddenly become Stadiums, that profit goes elsewhere...that crime goes elsewhere. \nME Bradley...you two got greed in common. \nKoenig grins. Junior keeps shifting. Dying to shoot him dead. \nME You knew about Wilhite and Lucille. That's how you were operating him. \n", "test3_true": "ME (a scowl for Junior) ...and someone else's... \nKOENIG (that great white grin ) We share an eye for human frailty and we're both born blackmailers Dave. (beat) I knew young Stemmons here had a fondness for Lads, stretching back to his days at the academy. \nME And now you're his only ally. (back at Junior) This sad queer who fell out with cops and flunked out with the Feds. (back to Koenig) So you get this file to battle Bradley with. What's Junior get in return? \nAnd like he was waiting for those words: Junior lunges. I twist to deflect but he's too fast -- feel something sink and drag in my side. I go down, gouge/groping for my gun. Instant trauma zaps nerves numb up the arm, fingers failing. Then a pain like boiling oil moves through my blood. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS JUST YOU! YOU FUCK! \nLook down, SEE: A mother-of-pearl knife hilt in my side, the business end stuck deep. Junior laughing as I fall to my knees. He pulls the file from the waist and tosses my .45. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS (CONT'D) (two inches from my face) THERE'S YOUR KNIFE KLEIN! \nKoenig takes the file, opening it. \nKOENIG (turning his back) I don't want to watch...I'm sorry it came to this, Dave. \nJunior, his own .45 pulled, put to my head. \nJUNIOR STEMMONS I hope the Bledsoe whore was worth it...'cuz she's still fucked. For a crooked cop, you think small. \nKoenig reads the file's first page, lifts it...a blank page behind...and behind that one... \nME (V.O.) Whatever moves I had left...I just made. \nKoenig spins back, more blank pages spilling from the file. \nKOENIG This isn't it! \n-Junior looks: that's all I need. Pull the pig-sticker off my ankle and corkscrew it into his calf, twisting. Junior bleats slaughtered-lamb as I reach up a wrench his gun free. Grab his tie, pull him down as I jut his gun up under his chin and fire two shots through the top of his head. \nHaul him down dead by his tie, turn -- Koenig's gun-hand flashes to his shoulder. Shoot him twice. He goes down gargling `fuck'. Stand-up on me sea-legs, bad wobble/weave as I slowly pull the knife from my side, pocket it. Feel blood flow saturate my pant leg. This weird wooze overcomes me as I approach Koenig. \nHe pulls himself into a sitting position, shaking his head. This bemused, beaten, half-grin as he flicks blood from his hand like his fingers had just brushed something sticky. \nKOENIG Poorly played Dave...poorly played... \nSay nothing. Keep Junior's .45 out. My intention crystal clear: endgame. Koenig looks up, this odd squint, like a bum about to beg for change. \nKOENIG Could I talk you into something? Cut you in on something? \nGive him no hope. \nME Won't work for me Fritz. \nHe nods, remorse, resignation...it at all looks the same now. \nKOENIG Give me a minute then? \nI do. Watch his hands as he removes his shoes, waiting for an ankle grab, his back-up piece...none comes. He sets his shoes aside, gazing up at the starless sky before issuing this short, gruff laugh...some inside joke that will die untold. \nKOENIG (with a nod) Okay... \n...and he holds his last breath and seems completely content as I shoot him. Cross to Junior now, rifle his clothes, retrieve a hotel key, Room 16, read it: MOTEL COMMODORE - 1195 Centinela Ave. Inglewood, CA 90302 \n95   INT. MOTEL COMMODORE - INGLEWOOD - LATE NIGHT             95 \nGeorge Ainge, sweating on a stained bedsheet, smoking reefer, goofing on a TV test pattern, randomly pulling at his dick. Walk by his window, he sees me, recognition kinks -- thinks this is a good sign...I shoot him right through the glass. \n96   EXT. TUDOR MANSION - EARLY A.M.                           96 \nBradley, roused from sleep, silk robe, coming down the stairs, his back door wide open. Reaches the landing, turns on the light. \nFeature me, this bobble-eyed ghoul, bloodying his settee. I look like something exhumed. His monogrammed serving napkins soak up blood from my knifed side. He startles school-girl. Throw the file at his feet: marred, mangled, stained. He inches forward, cinching his robe. \nBRADLEY Who? \nME Fritz Koenig. \nBRADLEY (going pale) Where? \nME Dead. Along with Wilhite, Junior...and Hector Magdalena. \nBRADLEY Why are you here? \nME To collect. I have the things you need to destroy Noonan's play. These same things can be used to destroy you. \nBradley, prim, proper, even this early. He sits down across from me like some fucking Duke. \n", "test3_id": 2843}

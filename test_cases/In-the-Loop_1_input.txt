Liza, Karen and Chad arrive in the buzzing State Department offices, knackered but in action mode. 
KAREN Okay - so, priorities are: take a shower, get me on Linton's War Committee, get me a dental appointment. Not necessarily in that order. 
Karen walks past various desks covered in tons of Post- Its. Stops a STAFFER as he passes. KAREN (cont'd) (CONT'D) What's Linton been up to while we've been away....have we declared war on California yet? 
But before the staffer can answer they run right into Linton. Karen stands her ground. 
LINTON Ah. Karen. 
KAREN Linton. 
LINTON How was London? Good hotel? 
KAREN Great hotel, thank you.

LINTON Good meetings? 
KAREN Yes. We had some good discussions. The time at Number Ten could possibly have been better spent but then... 
Karen realises that Linton is reading a message on his cell phone and not listening. 
LINTON Good. Welcome back. I'll read your words when they come through. Thank you so much 
Linton heads off to his office. A beat later so does Karen. Chad goes off a little towards Linton's office. 
KAREN Is Chad coming... ? LIZA (watching) He's doing his desperate chorus girl thing, hanging around trying to catch Linton's eye. That's why he's wearing his push-up bra today. 
CHAD (as he passes) Assistant Secretary of State -- hi. 
LINTON Brad. CHAD Chad 
LINTON Uh-huh. Exactly 
CHAD Can I...? 
Linton ignores him as he goes to join Bob Adriano waiting for him in his office. 
KAREN So listen, Liza, I need you to find out the names of the ten dullest committees currently operating on the hill. 
LIZA Dullest?

KAREN Because Linton is not going to call it the big horrible scarey war committee...they'll have buried the war committee under the most boring name they can think of. 'Diverse Strategy Committee'- not that, I'm on that. But it'll be a committee that sounds so tedious you want to self-harm. 
They glance over into Linton's area. He is glancing into theirs. 
KAREN(CONT'D) Can you get me General Miller at the Pentagon? (as she leaves) My teeth hurt like hell. 
LIZA (to herself) Sick of hearing about the teeth... 
Liza goes to her desk, picks up her landline. 
LIZA (cont'd) (CONT'D) Hi. I'm calling from Karen Clark's office about a paper written by a staffer here. We need to know if 'Post War Planning: Parameters, Implication's and Possibilities' has reached Assistant Secretary of State Linton Barwick yet? (listens) Yeah...by Liza Weld. (listens, shit!) 'Pwip Pip'? It's already been given an acronym? (listens) No I don't want to fast-track it. Would it possible to slow-track it? Well can we create one? 
32   INT. STATE DEPARTMENT. LINTON'S OFFICE - DAY                32 
Looking over at Karen. Now alone, who is still stealing glances over. 
LINTON I do not understand why anyone would choose to work in a glass office. In my opinion glass offices are for perverts. 
BOB ADRIANO I could request the glass be frosted?

LINTON (as if Bob Adriano brought it up) Frosting is for cakes, Bob. Now. What happened in London? 
BOB ADRIANO Generally positive. Two glitches. Karen flagged a report by one of her staffers - Liza. She's obviously trying to use it as some kind of roadblock. It's called Pwip Pip. 
LINTON Pip what? 
BOB ADRIANO Pwip Pip. 
LINTON What is that a report on - birdcalls? What does that stand for? 
BOB ADRIANO I don't recall. It's factish. Intel - case for and against intervention. 
LINTON We've got all the facts we need on this. In the land of truth, my friend, the man with one fact is king. You said there was another thing? 
BOB ADRIANO In the meeting with the Foreign Office the Committee was accidentally briefly alluded to. 
LINTON (putting his hand over his mouth so he can't be lip- read) Which committee?

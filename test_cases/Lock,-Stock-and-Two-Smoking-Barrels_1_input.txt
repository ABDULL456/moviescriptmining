DEAN I thought you said no staff, Bazza! 
BARRY You get the guns? 
DEAN You should see what they did to poor Gary. 
Gary wanders past the phone box in a gormless state. He obviously doesn't know what day of the week it is. 
DEAN Gary, get back into the van! 
Barry frowns down the telephone. Yeah, yeah, we got 'em. 
BARRY Good. I'll speak to you later. 
Barry clicks the phone off. Dean looks at Gary and raises his voice as if speaking to a deaf person. 
DEAN Gary, Gary, if you can hear me, I think we better get you back in the van now, OK? 
Dean takes his arm and guides him back into the van. 
BOXING GYM - NIGHT 
Stakes have increased dramatically. There is a pause as Frazer looks at his cards. 
EDDY Twenty thousand open. 
PHIL OK. My Doctor would beat me to a heart attack if he knew what was going on here. I fold. 
HATCHET Got some cards there, boy? Thirty thousand. Back to you already Eddy? 
Hatchet looks impatiently at the door. 
EDDY Fifty grand. 
Hatchet scours Ed's forehead. It is still dry. 
HATCHET Eighty grand. 
BOXING GYM CHANGING ROOM - NIGHT 
Barry, who is trying as hard as he can to see Ed's cards, frustratedly zooms in and out; eventually Ed raises them just enough; Barry jibs, hey bingo he sees Ed's cards! 
Ed's got nothing but a pair of sixes. Barry excitedly starts tapping away. 
INT. BOXING GYM - MGHT 
EDDY One hundred grand. 
FRAZER Hold on fellas, I know . . . 
HATCHER (interrupts j I know you're not in, which means nobody cares what you know. Two hundred and fifty. 
Hatchet and EDDY minutely study each other's hairlines, waiting for a nervous droplet to appear. Sweat breaks; a drop on Ed's forehead, fills frame. Slowly we follow a droplet's journey coursing down Eddy's brow Eventually this is met by a large unblinking eye, at this point the pause is broken. 
EDDY That is quite a raise, one hundred and fifty on my hundred. 
HATCHET Yes . . . and is there something else you want to say? EDDY 
As you know, this puts us in an awkward position. I don't have enough to continue. 
Pause. 
CROUPIER We will have to see both your cards if no one loans EDDY the money to continue. It's a loan or we see both your cards.

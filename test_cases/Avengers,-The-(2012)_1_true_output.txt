PLUMMETS TO EARTH, ROARING HIS SWAN SONG. 
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY 
IRON MAN laser cuts a big piece of broken metal. He then JUMPS on it, relieving the rotors. On the other side, BARTON'S men enter the port side. CAPTAIN AMERICA looks down, pondering if they are help. Evidently not as they begin SHOOTING at him and throwing grenades. CAPTAIN AMERICA jumps to the other railing and down with Barton's men. He begins to TAKE THEM DOWN, even goes as far as throwing one off. A few more enter, FIRING. CAPTAIN AMERICA grabs a NOVESKE RIFLEWORKS DIPLOMAT (big word for big fuckin' gun) and jumps back up to his position, firing down at them. 
INT. HELICARRIER BRIDGE ­ DAY 
The gunfight has gone down, but more of Barton's men enter and are taken by Fury, who is confused as to why they keep coming. 
NICK FURY They are not getting through here, so what the hell... Suddenly, Barton LOOSES an arrow down to the bridge and EXPLODES critical spots. Barton releases a multi-tipped arrow towards Fury, but instead hits his command desk, right above a USB 
OUTLETS. Fury FIRES at Barton, but is already gone. The arrow then self- activates and inserts itself into the outlets, hacking every single monitor and main frame. The hacking causes Engine 1 to shut off. Suddenly, the HELICARRIER begins to DANGEROUSLY TILT to one side. 
AGENT JASPER SITWELL (O.S.) Sir, we've lost all power in Engine 1. 
NICK FURY It's Barton. He took out our systems. He's headed for the detention level. Does anybody copy? 
INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER- DAY 
Still shaken by the HULK ordeal, Natasha sits there, rocking back and forth, after crying for a while. Summoning back all her coolness, she touches her EARPIECE. 
NATASHA This is Agent Romanoff. I copy. Natasha SPRINGS up and runs for Barton. 
EXT. HELICARRIER PORT SIDE ­ DAY 
IRON MAN begins to push the rotor using BOOSTERS from his boots. 
NICK FURY (V.O.) Stark, we're losing altitude. 
IRON MAN Yeah. Noticed. The rotors start propelling faster and faster as IRON MAN'S BOOSTERS get more and more bright. On the other side, CAPTAIN AMERICA continuously shoots at Barton's men. Blinking at the wrong moment, CAPTAIN AMERICA loses the upper hand and SLIDES off the railing, but grabs onto a LOOSE CABLE. 
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY 
Thor runs into the detention section where he finds Loki, escaping. 
THOR 
NO! Thor CHARGES at his brother. Loki walks up to him and CROUCHES down to attack. THOR ONLY GOES THROUGH HIM. The false Loki dissipates into nothingness. THE REAL LOKI comes out from behind the cell door, which closes on THOR, locking him up. Loki smiles. 
LOKI Are you ever not going to fall for that? 
INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY 
Barton walks alone down the catwalk. In a lightning fast move, Barton nocks an arrow, and points it at NATASHA. A hand-to-hand fight ensues. Natasha CRAWLS her way around Barton, making Barton to drop his bow, but pulls out a KNIFE on her. 
INT. HELICARRIER DETENTION SECTION ­ DAY 
Thor, in a fit of anger, SLAMS MJÖLNIR onto the glass cell. To his surprise, the cell door only CRACKS, but violently SHAKES the ship. Loki stands there in caution, as does his GUARDING 
SOLDIER. 
LOKI (smiles; walks over to the 
CONTROL PANEL) The humans think us immortal. Should we test that? Suddenly, GUARDING SOLDIER falls down like a tree. AGENT COULSON stands there, holding PHASE 2 WEAPON PROTOTYPE. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON Move away, please. Loki moves away from the switch. 
AGENT PHIL COULSON You like this? We started working on the prototype after you sent THE DESTROYER. Even I don't know what it does. Do you wanna find out? 
A LOUD GASP. AGENT COULSON IS IMPALED THROUGH THE HEART. THE 
REAL LOKI STANDS BEHIND COULSON. 
THOR Nooo! Loki sends Agent Coulson against the wall. Agent Coulson slumps down, breathing fast. Loki makes his way to the control switch. He gives his brother one last look. Thor looks at him, hopeful. Loki opens the HATCH. Thor still hopes. LOKI HITS THE BUTTON AND 
DROPS THOR OUT OF THE SHIP. 
INT. LOWER EQUIPMENT ROOM, CARRIER ­ DAY 
Barton and Natasha continue attacking each other. Natasha KICKBOXES Barton's face. Feeling that, Barton takes a SWING at her, but she grabs his arm, TWISTING it. BARTON WRITHES IN PAIN. Using his other arm, he tosses the knife over and begins to SLASH at Natasha. She dodges every move, but finds herself in a LOCK HOLD with him. As he forces the knife down, she BITES his wrist. Barton lets go of the knife. Natasha WRAPS her legs around his neck, FLIPS him over and arm LOCKS him. She SLAMS his head into a pipes rail. Barton goes down, hard. He looks up her, almost coming to his real senses. 
BARTON Natasha... Natasha COLDCOCKS him. Barton is out.

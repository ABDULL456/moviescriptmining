POLICEMAN Mr Manfred? 
JACK Yes... 
The sound of the roulette ball bouncing against the numbers. 
INT. MORGUE - NIGHT 
A POLICE DOCTOR uncovers a body on a gurney. The sound of the ball find-ing a number. JACK can hardly bear to look. It is MARION. With emotion... 
JACK'S VOICE What were the odds of being killed by a car... on New Year's Eve? 
MAN'S VOICE She was on her way home... to you. 
JACK No. She wasn't. 
JACK looks away from MARION'S face. He sees the MAN with the moustache, standing on the other side of the gurney, the MAN he saw with MARION on the street. He is DETECTIVE INSPECTOR ROSS. JACK is disorientated. 
JACK'S VOICE Marion had been visiting his mother...no, no, not his mother - her mother. 
JACK (to Ross) She was visiting her mother. Her mother. (suddenly) Who are you? 
ROSS Detective Inspector Ross. 
JACK Who... 
ROSS Ross. 
JACK Who did it? Tell me! 
He grabs ROSS'S lapels. ROSS carefully removes JACK'S hands. 
ROSS We think it's a hit-and-run. A drunk driver, probably, But there is a possibility of a revenge killing. 
JACK'S VOICE (distraught) Revenge? For what? Whose revenge? 
ROSS As you know, she was a WPC with the Met. up until two years ago. 
JACK fumbles in his pocket for a cigarette. There is a No Smoking sign on the wall. ROSS produces a Zippo and lights JACK'S Gitane. 
ROSS She called me last week. She'd got wind of a planned robbery at your casino. 
JACK'S VOICE What had that got to do with her death? 
ROSS You didn't recognise the man who attacked you, did you? 
JACK (loudly) Of course I recognised him! 
ROSS (surprised) You did? 
JACK I know a cheat when I see one. The man was a cheat. 
ROSS sighs, looks at MARION. 
JACK suddenly reaches down and pulls the white sheet back over MARION'S face. 
JACK (to Ross) Do you gamble? 
ROSS is puzzled. JACK drops his cigarette on the floor, grinds it with his shoe. ROSS gives JACK his card. 
ROSS If anything occurs to you, call me. 
JACK walks away from ROSS without a word. The DOCTOR is now filling out a form. 
From the door JACK looks back. ROSS waits for him to say something. JACK doesn't speak. 
ROSS I was in love with her, you know. 
There is a REPRISE of JACK covering MARION'S face with the sheet. 
EXT. STREETS - NIGHT 
In his croupier's suit JACK walks the night streets.

CLERK Pardon? Is there a problem--? 
POLICE CAPTAIN We received a report of an attempted murder in the Grimaldi Suite. Cordelia Scott-- Richard, sitting nearby, looks up at the mention of Cordelia's name, at the same time that Nikolai takes a seat at the far end of the same sofa. 
CLERK No. No. It is robbery. But, Mademoiselle Scott said it wasn't. Jean-Pierre, checking lists at the ballroom's entrance, notes the commotion and Cordelia's name, joins the group. 
JEAN-PIERRE Excuse me. What's--? Mademoiselle Scott has been robbed? 
CLERK No. She said, not. 
POLICE CAPTAIN She said someone was trying to kill her! We are going up! Richard seems to debate getting involved as the police, the clerk and Jean-Pierre head for the elevators. Looking over, he notices Nikolai, who smiles and nods.

CORDELIA 
(INCREDULOUS LAUGH) Thought she was me? Who could possibly believe--? 
ALICE They all did. Cordelia looks at Alice a beat as this lands with her. 
MEG (drives it home) Every one of them. 
CORDELIA But, look at you! Emma takes a step towards her doppelganger, facing off. 
EMMA Well, look at you! 
ALICE 
EMMA-- 
CORDELIA 
(DRIPPING CONTEMPT) Common country cows playing dress up. Pretending to be something you're not. Trying to be something that not one of you could ever hope 
TO BE-- 
EMMA You mean miserable? Cordelia blinks. 
EMMA (CONT'D) Or a petty, spoiled, selfish-- 
CORDELIA

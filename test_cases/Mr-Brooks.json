{"train": "Mr. Brooks lets himself in with a key. \nINT. BUILDING \u00d1 NIGHT \nExquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls, vases, cups, plates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around the room. \nThis is Mr. Brooks's CERAMICS STUDIO. \nMr. Brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the temperature, then in a series of quick cuts changes out of his tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects from a dozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging in a closet. \nBelow the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical leather work shoes. The windbreaker he puts on is also from a dozen identical windbreakers. \nHe takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which opens into a garage. Under the light is an older model non- descript Toyota. \nEXT. CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 NIGHT \nThe Toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door closing behind it, pulls away. \nINT. TOYOTA \u00d1 NIGHT \nMarshall is up front with Mr. Brooks. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARSHALL Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I've missed this! We are going to have so much fun! \nMR. BROOKS This is the last time, Marshall. Understand me?! The very last time! \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET \u00d1 NIGHT \nA mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings. Mr. Brooks's Toyota is parked in the semi-dark cast by a tree. \nWe rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the other side of the block and come down to find Mr. Brooks working the lock on the side door of a small BUNGALOW. \nHe has on surgical gloves. \nThe pick is extracted, the handle turned. The door opens. There's a chain. \nMr. Brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from a pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward. \nThe chain has been released. \nINT. BUNGALOW \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath stands very still and listens. \nThere's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of the house. \nMr. Brooks's feet glide out of the PANTRY. Now coming slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark slacks. \nMove up; the person in the black slacks is Marshall. \nIn the middle of the KITCHEN, the sound is now recognizable. It's the moans of a Couple fucking. This disturbs Mr. Brooks, he hesitates. \nMarshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARSHALL Don't you dare quit on me, you piece of shit. I want to see what they're doing. \nMr. Brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again. \nEntering a HALLWAY, he reaches into his jacket. When his hand reappears it's inside a Ziplock bag, his fingers around the butt of a silenced pistol. \nHe brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the Ziplock against his wrist. \nThe two Men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. Behind it the sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense. \nMr. Brooks nudges the door with his foot. It opens enough for he and Marshall to see the Couple inside. \nThe Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are naked on the bed. \nAs much as Mr. Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching. He can now hear his heart beating in his ears. \nHe begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his expression is distant almost clinical. \nWhen the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr. Brooks's face goes blank. \nOn the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of them lie there basking in the afterglow. \nBehind them Mr. Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips into the ROOM. They don't know he's there until he speaks. \nMR. BROOKS Hello. \nBoth the Man and Woman jump with surprise and look. The Woman screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself. \nMAN What the fuck?! \nThen he sees the gun. \nMAN Hey, man, don't... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I really hated yesterday, Snyder, and then today came along. \nAs she gets out of the car, the Men notice the bandages on her wrists and falling into step with her on the way to the house. \nSNYDER (OLDER DETECTIVE) What happened to your wrists? \nAtwood holds up her hands to reveal the extent of the bandages. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I tried to commit suicide. \nThe Young Detective laughs. Atwood whirls on him. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD What's so funny? \nYOUNG DETECTIVE Eh... I... I don't know, I heard it was because you were drunk and got into a fight with a fish tank. \nAtwood sticks her finger into the Young Detective's chest. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Who are you gonna believe? Me or the fucking fish?! \nYOUNG DETECTIVE Eh... you. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Good. \nAtwood turns and leaves the Men. \nYOUNG DETECTIVE (under his breath) She's nuts! \nSNYDER And rich. \nThey catch up to Atwood who has squatted down to examine the lock on the front door. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSNYDER There are some scratches in the side door cylinder. Other than that no signs of forced entry. The alarm was armed and we even had to cut the security chains to get in. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD (straightens up) This guy hasn't been active for over two years... \nShe enters the house. \nINT. MURDER HOUSE \u00d1 AFTERNOON \nFrom the way Atwood looks at her surroundings as she crosses the Living Room we get the feel that this Woman misses nothing. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD ... we think he's either dead or in jail on some other charge. This is probably a copycat. \nDetective Snyder points her down the Hall toward the Bedroom and follows. \nSNYDER That's why we called you. You're the God that tells us peons if we have a simple murder here or something we can dump on you. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Bite yourself. \nAtwood arrives in the doorway of the BEDROOM where the murders took place and stops. \nThe Bodies of the dance Couple are now on the floor. The Man is propped up against the bed in a sitting position. The Woman has her head in the Man's crotch. \nAlmost like Mr. Brooks, Atwood's nostrils flare, but in Atwood's case it's not the scent of death that arouses her but it's like she's searching for the scent of her prey. \nIn a glance she memorizes the Room, then steps inside. \nINT. BEDROOM \u00d1 AFTERNOON \nThe Crime Scene TECHNICIANS shift to accommodate Atwood's inspection. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD (indicating the Victims) He always rearranges the bodies, but this is out of character. He has never left them in such a crude position. Usually it's more romantic with their arms around each other, kissing, their mouths open, their tongues touching. \nSNYDER So we have a copycat? \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Where are the thumbprints? \nSnyder points to a bare space of wall above the bed. Atwood leans in to look at two bloody 'thumbprints' placed side by side. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD One his one hers? \nSNYDER That's what it looks like. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD What's that? \nThere are two holes gouged into the plaster of the wall. \nSNYDER The bullets went completely through the victims. The killer recovered the slugs. \nAtwood unfolds and after another look around the room goes to the window and cracks the curtains. \nThere's the four story Apartment Building across the alley, its windows staring down at her. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Were these open or closed when you got here? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSNYDER Closed. \nAtwood tries the cord, the curtains are stuck. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Hmm... \nIn a robe and pajamas, Mr. Brooks comes down the HALLWAY carrying a glass of milk. The door to his Daughter's ROOM is partly open. By the nightlight in the plug at the head of the bed he can see she's asleep. \nINT. BEDROOM \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks walks to the bed, leans over and kisses his Daughter on the cheek. \nMR. BROOKS (quietly) It's nice to have you home. \nHe leaves. \nEXT. CHICAGO - MORNING \nThe early rays of the sun are moving down the tall buildings. \nEXT. BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 MORNING \nA garbage truck is picking up the trash. \nINT. BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 MORNING \nDressed for work and a smile on his face, Mr. Brooks comes down the stairs. \nIn the BREAKFAST ROOM, the mood is decidedly different. His Wife and Daughter are leaning against opposite walls staring at the floor. \nMR. BROOKS What's wrong? \nEMMA Ask your daughter what the real reason is she dropped out of school. \nJANE I keep telling you it's not the reason. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEMMA You wanted to go to college, you had good grades in High School, your father helped you get into Stanford, we're paying a ton of money, if this is not the reason, then please dear God tell me the reason. \nMR. BROOKS (picking up an orange juice) Why does your mother think you dropped out of school? \nJANE I'm pregnant. (to her Mother) And it's not the reason I dropped out. Being pregnant wouldn't stop me from going to school if I wanted to go. \nMR. BROOKS Who's the father? \nJANE Some guy I was seeing. \nEMMA Does he know? \nJANE Yes, he's a married man and he doesn't want to have anything to do with me. \nEMMA Oh, Honey, I'm so sorry. \nJANE I'm going to have an abortion anyway, so there is nothing to get upset about. I wasn't even going to tell you guys. \nMr. Brooks looks directly at his Daughter. \nMR. BROOKS There will be no abortion. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nJANE Daddy, you are not going to tell me what to do. It's my body and I will do what I want to do with it. \nMr. Brooks's eyes find Emma's. Almost imperceptibly she shakes her head 'no'. \nMR. BROOKS (to his Daughter) You're right. I'm sorry. I said it wrong. I'm not trying to tell you what to do. I'm trying to say that a grandchild would be a wonderful gift for your mother and me. \nEMMA Please, Honey, don't have an abortion. \nJANE Would you really want to have a grandchild, even though I'm not married? \nMR. BROOKS Yes. The child is what's important. We would love it and cherish it completely and help you raise it. \nJANE If it means that much to you, I'll think about it. \nINT. GARAGE - BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 MORNING \nWalking to the Lexus, Mr. Brooks notices Marshall waiting for him on the passenger side. \nMR. BROOKS (smiles) Well, we were right, she was hiding something. \nMARSHALL (flat) Pregnant's not all of it. She's hiding something bigger. Much bigger. \nMR. BROOKS You think so? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARSHALL I know so, and so do you. \nINT. CRIME LAB \u00d1 AFTERNOON \nLarge and small Color Photographs pinned to a corkboard create a Collage of the dance Couple murder scene. \nStanding in front of this is CAPTAIN LISTER, a tall slim open- faced Woman in her mid-fifties, and the lead Crime Scene Technician we saw earlier at the Murder House. \nTECHNICIAN It's not what's here, it's what's not here that's interesting. There's not a trace of anything foreign. If I didn't know better I'd say these people were killed by a ghost. \nCAPTAIN LISTER The autopsy found a tiny piece of plastic in the female victim's brain. \nWith a key she lets herself in. \nEXT. STREET \u00d1 NIGHT \nParked against the curb opposite the driveway of the Murder House is an old green Pontiac Convertible with the top up. \nThe driver's window is down and from inside a WOMAN, late 20's, is watching the house. \nINT. MURDER HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT \nAtwood stops in the PANTRY almost in the exact spot where Mr. Brooks stopped. \nThe quiet is filled by the rain drumming on the roof. The wind rattles the windows. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD How did you know where they were in the house? \nShe steps into the KITCHEN. On the way across she bumps into a chair. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD It's darker tonight than it was on your night. But still how did you manage not to bump into the furniture? Did you have a little light? That would be too dangerous. I'll bet you were in the house before. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: DETECTIVE ATWOOD (CONT'D) So I should ask the neighbors if they saw a meter reader around the house or a telephone repairman or someone from the gas company. \nThese musings take her through the LIVING ROOM to the entrance of the HALLWAY where she pauses and looks both ways. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Once again, how did you know where they were? Did you check the rooms before you found them? She had his semen in her vagina, they had just made love, did you hear them or was there a light on? \nShe steps into the HALL. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD And when did you bag the gun? Because even though I'm sure you're an expert at it, there's still a chance of noise from the plastic. \nShe continues down the HALL to the BEDROOM. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Was the door open or did you have to open it? \nShe opens the door and goes in. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Were they asleep or awake? Was the light on, or did you turn it on? Because I know you, you wouldn't risk a shot in the dark. \nShe turns on the overhead light. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Too bright. What if it wasn't that light that was on, but this one? \nShe turns on a bedside light and goes back to the door and turns off the overhead. \nIf the dance Couple were on the bed and their blood was not on the wall, the room would look exactly the way it did when Mr. Brooks said 'hello'. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD That's better... What thrill do you get by killing people? Is it sexual, is it hate, is it power? Do you feel remorse? Probably that part of your brain doesn't exist. Do you have emotions of love or affection or joy? Or have you learned to fake them so you won't stand out in a crowd. \nShe's at the window now, feeling the curtains. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD What if these are stuck closed because you yanked them closed? Which means they were open when you came into the room. \nShe separates the fabric and looks out the rain-streaked window at the four story building across the alley. There are lights on in almost all the apartment windows. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD If Mr. and Miss Normal made love with the curtains open and the lights on, someone in that building noticed them and may have seen you. \nShe allows the fabric to drop back into place and turns to look at the bed. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Was that what you were angry about? \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING \u00d1 NIGHT \nMoving slowly across a neutral colored wall. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD (O.S.) Thank you for your time. \nA door is closed. We come to the corner and are looking down a HALLWAY at Atwood coming toward us. We move to her and arrive just as she raises her fist to knock. \nBefore she can, the door opens and she and Mr. Smith who is on his way out of his Apartment are surprised that the other one is suddenly there. Each one takes a half step back. \nPhwap! The manila envelope that was wedged under Mr. Smith's left arm hits the floor. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. SMITH Oh! You scared me. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I'm sorry... (bends down and picks up the envelope) ... I was about to knock. I'm Detective Atwood with the Chicago Police. \nMR. SMITH (accepting the envelope) Thank you. \nThrough the open door, Atwood can see Mr. Smith's camera on a table and the collapsed tripod leaning against the wall. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Are you a photographer... (glances at her list) Mr. Baffert? \nMR. SMITH No... eh, it's kind of a hobby, I just started. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I don't know if you're aware but there was a murder... \nMR. SMITH Oh, yes in the house across the alley... \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Did you happen to see anything unusual or suspicious that night around that house? Anything at all? \nMR. SMITH Really? That's it? I thought you might already have someone in mind. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMR. BROOKS I don't enjoy this, Mr. Smith. I do it because I'm addicted to it. And before you entered my life I had vowed I would never kill again. So this is your party, you can chose anyone you want and we'll do it together. \nMR. SMITH Can it be someone I know? \nMR. BROOKS You never kill someone you know. That's the easiest way to get caught. \nEXT. STREET \u00d1 NIGHT \nThe Toyota enters the traffic. \nINT. APARTMENT BUILDING \u00d1 NIGHT \nAn older WOMAN in a Stewardess uniform is standing in the doorway of her apartment. Atwood is in front of her in the HALL. \nSTEWARDESS I wasn't in town that night, my roommate was, maybe he saw something. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD May I speak to him? \nSTEWARDESS He's on his way to Tokyo now, he's also a Flight Attendant. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Did the victims ever leave the curtains in the bedroom open? \nSTEWARDESS All the time. I don't know if they thought we couldn't see them \"fucking\" or they didn't care. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Here's my card, could you ask your roommate to call me when he gets back, the people at that number will find me any hour of the day or night. \nSTEWARDESS I won't be here, but I'll leave him a note. \nEXT. STREET \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks' Toyota is cruising in the flow of traffic. \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) ... maybe I already know how to pick the locks on the house, if I don't... \nINT. TOYOTA \u00d1 NIGHT \nMR. BROOKS ... I buy one of those locks and I practice on it, same with the alarm... some I know how to bypass, some I have to study. \nMR. SMITH You don't mind me asking these questions? \nMR. BROOKS No. This is your first time, you're interested. And you should be if you're... \nA neutral-colored PICKUP swerves out of the next lane into Mr. Brooks' lane. \nMR. SMITH Jesus Christ!! \nMr. Brooks is forced to slam on his brakes to avoid running up the PICKUP'S tailpipe. \nHOONKK!!! Mr. Brooks angrily lays on the horn. \nThe brake lights of the PICKUP flash in response causing Mr. Brooks to brake again. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. SMITH Fuck him!! It was his fault!! What an asshole!! \nMARSHALL (leans forward) Maybe Mr. Smith would like to kill the driver of the pickup. \nMR. BROOKS (to Mr. Smith) What about the driver of the pickup? What if we killed him? \nMR. SMITH Oh, fuck, yes!! I've always wanted to kill someone who fucked with me in traffic. \nThe PICKUP makes a right onto a side street. Mr. Brooks follows. \nMR. BROOKS Do you want to kill the driver of the pickup or the owner, they may not be the same. \nMR. SMITH The driver. \nMR. BROOKS Okay we'll follow until we get a look at him, or her; would it bother you to kill a woman? \nMR. SMITH No. An asshole's an asshole. \nMr. Brooks begins to slow down. \nMR. SMITH What are you doing? \nMR. BROOKS The asshole shouldn't know we've decided to follow him, or her. \nEXT. FOUR STORY APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nDetective Atwood is on her way out the Outer Door when the hair on the back of her neck stands on end. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nFootsteps can be heard running toward her through the rain. \nLARRY She started her career in theology with a lie?! \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Isn't that what all theology is based on? \nLARRY Did you pass the test? \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Oh yeah... \nLARRY Don't tell me she ended up as Mother Teresa or the Pope. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD No, she realized very quickly there wasn't enough money in religion for her, the last I heard she'd written a diet book that was very successful. \nLARRY She stayed in religion. \nAtwood smiles, her fingers find Larry's and they intertwine. \nThe view floats over the balcony. \nAs it slowly drops, the PEOPLE on the dance floor, Couple by Couple, disappear until there are only three Couples left, one of them is Atwood and Larry. Her head is on his shoulder. \nIt's a slow dance. \nLarry is very good and wherever he leads, Atwood easily follows. The lights begin to dim and we move in. \nLarry touches his lips to Atwood's neck. She arches back and he kisses her neck again and again. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nHis lips move up and find hers, and we are now close on the kiss. Gently the lips separate and we slowly retreat. \nLooking into her eyes, Larry traces her lips with a finger, then replaces that finger with his tongue. \nHis lips brush a cheek, down her neck to where it meets her shoulder, his teeth close softly on the muscle, by now we are far enough away to realize that Atwood and Larry have no clothes on and we are: \nINT. HALLWAY - DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM \u00d1 NIGHT \nWhat light there is, is coming from a room we can't see. \nLarry nibbles at Atwood collarbone, kisses a breast, strokes his hands down her sides. She shivers. He brushes his lips back and forth across her stomach and then down to where the flesh of her belly meets her pubic hair. \nShe's watching all of this in a mirror on the opposite wall. \nThen he sinks to his knees and buries his head between her legs. From low in her throat, Atwood moans. We lose sight of the Couple as we move around a corner. \nINT. BEDROOM \u00d1 DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM - NIGHT \nIt's dark. Atwood is propped up against the headboard, the sheet pulled up over her breasts. \nThe door to the BATHROOM opens. Larry dressed in his suit, minus the tie, comes out, kneels on the bed and kisses her. \nLARRY Thank you, this was wonderful. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD For me too. \nLARRY I'll see you then? \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I'd like that. The money is in the usual place. \nLARRY It's not just the money, Tracy. I like you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I like you too, Larry. Send me a bill for the dress and the shoes. \nLARRY I will. Good-night. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Good-night. \nEXT. MR. BROOKS' CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 NIGHT \nThe rain is muffled by the trees. \nMove slowly toward the Building then up the side to peek through the narrow window that circles just below the roof line. \nIn the center of the room, the kiln relieves the darkness with a yellow red glow whose rim touches a slash of white light coming from under a door tucked in a corner. \nINT. CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 NIGHT \nWe creep through the white light across the floor that's littered with splashes of paint and smears of clay to the office door and peer under it. \nIn front of us are chair casters and two bare feet and legs. \nMARSHALL (O.S.) I think that was right. Go back. \nMR. BROOKS (O.S.) We're in. \nMARSHALL (O.S.) With the taxes we pay, you'd think they could make it more difficult to hack into the Police personnel files. \nWe tip toe under the door. \nINT. OFFICE - CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 NIGHT \nIt's crammed with file cabinets. Sketches for pottery pieces are taped to the walls along with photos of Mr. Brooks, Jane and Emma. \n(CONTINUED) \nAtwood stands up with her coffee. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I'd like to get this done as soon as possible. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nThe Asian Attorney also stands and gathering her papers and coffee. \nASIAN ATTORNEY Are you working on the Thumbprint Killer this time? \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Yeah. \nASIAN ATTORNEY That one's creepy to me. The doors are locked, the alarms are armed and the people are dead. It makes you feel like you're not safe anywhere. \nAtwood nods and opens the front door then follows the Attorney out. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STARBUCKS \u00d1 MORNING \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Where are you parked? \nASIAN ATTORNEY I'm right over there. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I'm down the street. Call me as soon as you have something. \nShe starts to walk away. \nASIAN ATTORNEY Oh, Tracy... I almost forgot, your husband says there's a picture of him holding some trophy that you still have. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD He took all those pictures. He took everything. \nASIAN ATTORNEY He claims it's his favorite picture and you put it up where you store your suitcases. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I'll look. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nASIAN ATTORNEY I know it's petty, but you're going through a divorce. \nEXT. SIDEWALK \u00d1 MORNING \nAtwood strides toward her car. The PEDESTRIAN traffic is light. It's too early for the stores to be open. \nUp ahead a BROWN VAN is idling at the curb, the sliding side door is open. Atwood can see inside. Empty except for some furniture blankets. \nThe Person in the Driver's seat turns to look into the back. It's the Woman who was watching Atwood outside the Murder House. Her hands are unseen in leather gloves. \nShe looks up and their eyes meet. Two strangers. The contact is instantly broken. \nAtwood takes a deep breath and smiles. After the rain, the air is brisk and clean. It's good to be alive. \nSLAM!!! Atwood is body-checked by a Man who springs out of the recess of a doorway. His arms wrap around her, she's lifted off her feet and the Man throws himself and her into the Van. \nINT. BROWN VAN - MORNING \nOooff!! The wind is knocked out of Atwood when she lands left shoulder first on the furniture blankets, the Man on top of her. \nThe Man is Thorton Meeks, the Hangman, six feet, a solid two hundred pounds. He's also wearing tight leather gloves. \nEXT. STREET \u00d1 MORNING \nThe Brown Van accelerates fast away from the curb. \nINT. BROWN VAN \u00d1 MORNING \nHis body crushing hers, Meeks kisses Atwood's cheek. \nMEEKS Surprise, surprise, Tracy. I told you I was coming back to get you. \nHe frees his right hand and pulls his gun. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMEEKS I already know where I'm gonna hang you. But first I'm gonna watch her... (indicates the Driver) ... have some fun with you, then she's gonna watch me have some fun with you. \nHe kisses her again and puts the gun to Atwood's head. \nMEEKS Now, don't move. \nHe raises up and straddles her. \nMEEKS You know the drill, I'm gonna put the cuffs on. \nWith his left hand he fishes a pair of handcuffs from a back pocket and snaps them on Atwood's right wrist. \nMEEKS Now the left. \nHe rolls Atwood on her back and with the chain of the handcuff pulls her right arm toward her left. \nAll Meeks' talk has allowed Atwood to catch her breath and suddenly she jerks her head up into the gun and screams at the top of her lungs. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD SHOOT ME!!! \nAt the same time she pulls hard against the handcuff with her right wrist. A startled Meeks is thrown off balance. The gun comes away from Atwood's head. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD None of these is the woman in the van. \nDOCTOR Whoa... I'm sewing up your head here. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Sorry. \nCAPTAIN LISTER And your ego can handle that? \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD It doesn't like any of the other choices. \nCAPTAIN LISTER Until Meeks is caught, Snyder is with you. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Nothing personal, Snyder. (to Lister) He's not part of our team. \nCAPTAIN LISTER He's there to protect you. And listen to him, he's been alive longer than you have. \nSNYDER I didn't volunteer for this, Atwood. \nCAPTAIN LISTER The Parking Lot has a security camera. We're checking the tape. If Meeks and the Woman left in a car we'll have a license number. You have two days then I want a progress report on your divorce. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I think I have all the pieces on the Thumbprint Killer, I'm just not looking at them the right way. \nCAPTAIN LISTER Okay, you have three days. \nShe leaves. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD (smiles sweetly at Snyder) Every babysitter I ever had loved me. \nEXT. DRUG STORE PARKING LOT \u00d1 NIGHT \nIn the scattering of vehicles Mr. Brooks' Toyota is hidden in plain sight in a row of cars. \nINT. TOYOTA \u00d1 NIGHT \nBehind the wheel, Mr. Brooks is again wearing his Pottery- Throwing clothes. Mr. Smith is in the passenger seat and Marshall is leaning forward from the back. \nThey're all focused to varying degrees on the Entrance to the store. Mr. Smith raises his watch for a look at the time. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. SMITH Maybe he went home with someone else. \nMR. BROOKS Can you still see his pickup? \nMr. Smith looks. \nMR. SMITH Uh huh. \nMR. BROOKS This is not the kind of guy who leaves his pickup in an unguarded Lot overnight. \nThe silence returns. \nAll three Men idly observe an old green Pontiac convertible with a frayed top and paint peeling, come into the Lot and park two spaces away facing them. We saw this car last watching Atwood from outside the Murder House. \nThe headlights go off. \nThe Driver's door opens. The Woman who was with Meeks in the Van steps out and hurries toward the Drug Store. \nShe of course means nothing to Mr. Brooks but in the brief seconds the domelight is on, he catches sight of the Man in the passenger seat. A memory tickles his brain. \nHe turns to Marshall. \nMR. BROOKS Where do we know that guy from? \nMARSHALL You really should pay more attention to what you read, Earl. \nMR. BROOKS That's what I have you for, Marshall. \nMARSHALL His picture was on the front page of the paper a couple days ago because he escaped from jail. He's the killer they call the Hangman. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMR. BROOKS Ahh... \nMARSHALL Remember that cop you like, Atwood, who's chasing us, she's the one who put him away. I think his name is Thorton Meeks. \nMr. Brooks cocks his head at the vague outline of Meeks. \nMR. BROOKS Well, well, well... What would life be without surprises? \nMr. Smith who, remember, cannot hear or see Marshall, straightens up. \nMR. SMITH There he is! \nThe Man they are waiting for is coming down the steps of the store. On the way to his Pickup he takes off a Manager's smock. \nMR. SMITH You know what's weird? I'll bet he has all these plans of what he's going to do tonight and tomorrow and he doesn't know he will already be dead and won't be able to do any of them. \nMr. Brooks nods absently. The Drug Store Manager arrives at his truck. \nMR. BROOKS I don't think I want to kill this guy. \nMr. Brooks steps out of the Toyota onto a sheet of plastic. Two strides away is an industrial vacuum cleaner. \nINT. TOYOTA \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks vacuums the passenger seat and dash and floor and everything around it. \nINT. GARAGE \u00d1 CERAMICS STUDIO - NIGHT \nMr. Brooks removes his shoes and leaves them on the plastic, then slips his feet into paper slippers. \nWith handiwipes he wipes down the outside of the passenger door, in fact anything on that side Mr. Smith could have touched. \nHe opens the door and wipes down the seat and the dash and the console. \nBack on the plastic, Mr. Brooks undresses. On top of his clothes he drops the used handiwipes, the slippers and the vacuum bag. \nThe corners of the plastic sheet are folded up, twisted together and Zip-tied to create a nice neat package which Mr. Brooks picks up and takes into the Ceramics Studio. \nINT. SHOWER - CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks rinses off the lather under the spray. \nINT. CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 NIGHT \nThe glow from 3000 degrees Fahrenheit is coming through the window of the kiln. \nINT. OFFICE - CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 NIGHT \nThe Driver's license, complete with picture, of the Woman who was with Meeks in the Drug Store parking lot, is up on the computer screen. \nMr. Brooks, now back in his regular clothes, brings the cursor down to the address. He scores this and drags it into Yahoo Maps 'driving directions'. \nA route is generated. Mr. Brooks brings the cursor up to 'Print' and clicks. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCLOSE on his Printer. The map is fed out and settles into the tray. \nEXT. BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 MORNING \nAn unmarked Police car stops on the gravel of the Turn- Around. Two Plainclothes DETECTIVES get out and walk to the front door. \nThe taller One rings the bell and they wait and then the door is opened by Mr. Brooks. \nIn a flash he takes in the car and the way the Men are dressed and although his face doesn't betray it, he knows what they are. \nMR. BROOKS Hi, what can I do for you? \nThe shorter One holds up a badge. \nDETECTIVE 1 I'm Detective Smolny with the Chicago Police and this is Detective Carfagno, from Palo Alto, California... \nCARFAGNO (DETECTIVE 2) (showing his badge) We'd like to speak to Jane Brooks, if that's possible. \nMR. BROOKS Jane is my daughter, what's this about? \nCARFAGNO There was a murder at Stanford not long before she left. She may be able to help us. \nMR. BROOKS Is she a suspect? \nCARFAGNO Not at this time. We simply would like to ask her some questions. \nSMOLNY (DETECTIVE 1) Is your daughter here? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. BROOKS Yes... she is. \nCARFAGNO The questions won't take long. \nMR. BROOKS I'm sure you would have no objection if she had an attorney present. \nSMOLNY That's fine. (reaching into his pocket) Here's my card. We can schedule a time for later today or tomorrow for her to come in to see us. \nMr. Brooks looks at the card. \nMR. BROOKS If you gentlemen can wait, I will call my lawyer right now and see what we can work out. \nSMOLNY Oh, that's even better. \nMR. BROOKS (opening the door wider) Would you like some coffee? \nSMOLNY Thank you. \nINT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY \u00d1 BROOKS HOUSE - MORNING \nMarshall is walking alongside a very disturbed Mr. Brooks. \nMARSHALL We both knew she was hiding something bigger, I certainly didn't think it was this big. \nMR. BROOKS She's not a suspect, Marshall. She may not have anything to do with it at all. \nMr. Brooks opens a door. The room that is revealed is a very well equipped home GYM. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, and Wisdom to know the difference... \nINT. KITCHEN \u00d1 BROOKS HOUSE - DAY \nWith a shaky hand, Mr. Brooks raises the glass to his lips. \nMR. BROOKS God help me. What do I do? \nSitting on the island behind him Marshall waits for Mr. Brooks to gulp the glass dry. \nMARSHALL She did it, didn't she? \nMR. BROOKS Yeah. It'll take the Cops a week to ten days to put their case together and then they'll come back and arrest her. \nMARSHALL What are you going to do? \nMr. Brooks puts his hands over his eyes and sobs, then wiping away the tears: \nMR. BROOKS I've been afraid of this since the day she was born. She has what I have. \nMARSHALL Yes, she does. But you've always been smart about it. She was stupid. She did it because she got off on it, she did it for fun. Why didn't she think it through? A hatchet! And she left it there!! \nMR. BROOKS They were pretty graphic, weren't they? \nMARSHALL That was to shock her into making a mistake. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. BROOKS What does she think I think? Doesn't she remember what she told me? That the BMW was being driven across country by a friend and now right in front of me, she tells the Cops it was stolen. \nMARSHALL You've always cleaned up after her, whatever she did, all her life. \nMR. BROOKS If the BMW has anything incriminating in it, I hope it was stolen or she dropped it at the bottom of a very deep lake. \nMARSHALL Do you think she knows what kind of trouble she's in? \nMR. BROOKS I think she thought she had gotten away with it until the Cops showed up. I should have listened to her, it was there. She was telling me. 'I didn't quit school because I was pregnant'. I should have dug deeper. \nMARSHALL And where would you be but at the exact same place you are now. It is not your fault, Earl. Part of your problem with her is that you always think it is. \nMR. BROOKS She has what I have, Marshall. So on a very basic level, it is my fault. \nMARSHALL What are you going to do? \nMR. BROOKS Maybe the best thing for her would be to let her go to jail. \nMARSHALL And what about her child? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMR. BROOKS Emma and I would raise it. \nMARSHALL You might be right, Earl, you might be. Because you know if she's not stopped, she's going to do it again. And if she wants to take over the box business, the next victim could be you. \nMR. BROOKS I don't think she'd go that far. \nINT. CRIME LAB \u00d1 DAY \nA slide of what looks like enlarged grains of sand among giant carpet fibers is projected onto a screen. \nThe Lead Crime Lab Technician: \nSIGY (O.S.) We found traces of this in two places. \nThe slide changes to an overhead schematic showing the interior of the house where the dance Couple was murdered. \nDetective Atwood and Detective Snyder are standing with Sigy watching the presentation. Atwood has a bandage covering the stitches over her eye. \nSIGY (with a laser pointer) Here and here. \nThe red dot indicates an area just outside the Kitchen and just outside the Bedroom. \nSIGY We did an analysis and it's made up of feldspar, alumina and kaolin. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD What's that? \nSIGY A high fire stoneware clay. \nSNYDER Like you make ashtrays and vases from? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSIGY This is more plates and teacups. It was slightly wet when whoever it was tracked it into the house and it stuck to the carpet fibers. We're thinking it was the killer. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD It could have been tracked in by a friend. \nSIGY That's the thing, you see, the friend would have had to have been there almost at the same time the killer was. Otherwise the samples would have been dry and the killer would have vacuumed them up. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Is the clay rare, is it difficult to get? \nSIGY You can buy it almost anywhere. \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) - time - tomorrow - \nTurns the page. \nMR. BROOKS - night - Don't - be - stupid -. \nMr. Smith refolds the Newspaper and throws it at the passenger seat. \nMR. SMITH Fuck you! \nHe inserts the key into the ignition. \nRAP-RAP!! There's a sudden sharp KNOCK!!, on the Driver's window. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMr. Smith levitates off the seat!! Unable to breathe, he turns. \nDetective Atwood's face lowers into view. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD You remember me? \nAll Mr. Smith can do is nod. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Would you step out of the car, please, I want to talk to you. \nEXT. CAR \u00d1 DAY \nAtwood steps back as Mr. Smith gets out. Behind her, Detective Snyder is standing next to the Driver's door of an un-marked Police car which has blocked Mr. Smith in. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD So Mr. Baffert, what is that you have to tell me? \nMR. SMITH What do you mean? I don't have anything to tell you. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Really? Because I was driving around and I got this sudden feeling that you had something to tell me about the murders. \nMR. SMITH No. Nothing. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD That's disappointing. Because when I left you the last time we talked, I felt I had missed a clue that was right in front of me that would solve this whole case. \nMR. SMITH I don't know why you would feel that. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Didn't you tell me you were an amateur potter, that you made bowls and vases? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. SMITH No, I said I was an amateur photographer. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Are you positive? Because we found potter's clay on the carpet of the murder house and I was sure you said to me that you worked with clay, that you made pots. \nMR. SMITH No. I said my hobby was photography, not pottery. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Maybe that was it. The Stewardess upstairs said the victims kept their curtains open when they made love. Could I see some of the pictures you took of that Couple? \nMr. Smith can only stare at Detective Atwood. His Adam's apple moves up and down though he makes no sound. Should he or shouldn't he? \nFinally he throws his arms up in a shrug but in his half-turn of indecision he happens to spy the Newspaper he tossed at the passenger seat of his car. \nPart of it is draped over the console. The red circles around the words on that page jump out at him. \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) Don't - be - stupid -. \nMr. Smith returns his attention to Detective Atwood. \nMR. SMITH You are harassing me, Detective Atwood. You know very well I'm not a potter and I don't have any pictures! So my feeling is that your feeling is wrong and that you should move your car and let me go home. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD What is your job here? What do you do? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMR. SMITH I'm a mechanical engineer. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD You have to be pretty smart for that, don't you? \nMR. SMITH I guess. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Then be smart, Mr. Baffert. You lied to me right there at the end. I'll be watching you. And when you want to tell me the truth, you know how to get in touch with me. \nShe gives him a dazzling smile. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD See you later, alligator. \nAtwood walks back to her car and gets in. \nINT. UNMARKED POLICE CAR \u00d1 DAY \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD (under her breath) Goddamit... \nAs Snyder accelerates away he points to the car's computer screen. \nSNYDER Captain Lister got us the search warrant for Meeks' Chiropractor. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Good. (shakes her head 'no', frustrated) Goddamit!, that guy knows something... (meaning Mr. Smith) He almost told me and then something happened. \nA light and footsteps hurry toward her from the LIVING ROOM. Atwood swings her light at them. \nSNYDER Hey! \nHe squints and turns away. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I thought you were behind me. \nSNYDER The living room is clean. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nAtwood swings her light back onto the dead Woman. The combined illumination of the flashlights cause the support joists twelve feet up to throw eerie shadows onto the open ceiling. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Snyder, meet Mona. \nThe Uniformed Policeman comes up beside Atwood. \nUNIFORMED POLICEMAN I called it in. \nThe smell of blood and the sight of the carnage is too much for him. His gorge rises and he gags. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Do that outside. \nThe Officer doesn't have to be told twice. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD (to Snyder, re: the body) Meeks did this. \nSNYDER I thought Meeks hung people. \nAtwood retraces her steps in the Kitchen. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Meeks is a steroid freak. This Refrigerator was always full of steroids. Mona was Alvin Griffin's niece, receptionist, lover and keeper of the keys. \nShe focuses her flashlight on an open padlock dangling from a steel band that runs around the Refrigerator. With the barrel of the Glock she opens the door. \nThe only edibles inside are a tomato, half a loaf of bread, a package of hotdogs and some part of a chicken in a KFC box. The rest of the space is vacant. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Well, the steroids are certainly gone. \nSNYDER You think Meeks has Alvin with him? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Meeks thinks Alvin turned him in. \nShe shuts the Refrigerator. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Let's go see what's in the rest of the house. \nCUT TO: \nAtwood and her flashlight pass us. Three feet to her right and slightly behind is Snyder and his flashlight. \nThe two Detectives are leaving the Living Room and entering the HALL toward the bedrooms. The ceiling is low here and it feels very claustrophobic. \nAhead is a Door painted red. \nBut before they get to it, there's a Room on the right. Snyder shines his light in. \nIt's a BATHROOM. The shower curtain is open. Nobody in the tub. \nThe Door ahead is waiting, but there's another Door on the right. Snyder shines his light in. \nThis one is a Treatment Room with a Therapy table and shelves of oils and unguents. \nThey've come to the red Door. Atwood will open this one. \nShe turns the knob and pushes. The Door is stuck. She and Snyder exchange a look. \nSnyder shuffles back half a step and flattens himself against the wall. He shuts off his flashlight. \nAtwood takes a deep breath, levers her weight against the door and pushes. \nThere's a sudden Snap! Then the door swings freely open. The beam of Atwood's flashlight reveals a large room containing a bed, a dresser, a... \nCREEEKKK!!! The sound is coming from up in the rafters. Atwood whips her flashlight in that direction. \nFor an instant the beam catches a piece of a large shape falling fast right at her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nThen it's lost in the darkness and then picked up again in the reflected light in the Hall. The shape is a naked Man. \nWHACK!! The Man nails Atwood in the shoulder. BANG! Her gun goes off. She bounces into the wall and onto her ass. \nBarely slowed the Man continues in an upward arc. His feet and knees slam into the ceiling. Plaster dust rains. \nThe Man swings back, past Snyder. He's lost in the darkness again. Then he swings back into the light and comes to a stop just inside the bedroom Door. \nThe Man is hanging from a rope around his neck. He's dead. His Body is festooned with syringes stuck into his bare flesh. \nIn fact two of the needles hold a sheet of paper to the Man's chest. Printed on the paper in big black letters are the words: \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Yes? \nINT. LAW OFFICES \u00d1 MORNING \nThe Asian Attorney interrupts her sip of coffee. \nASIAN ATTORNEY Hi Tracy, this is Nancy Tang. We received a counter offer. Are you sitting down? \nINT. DEN - DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM \u00d1 MORNING \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Yeah, go ahead... He can't get that, can he?! \nINTERCUT with Nancy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNANCY (ASIAN ATTORNEY) No, my sense of it is by asking for five, they're hoping you'll settle anywhere between two five and three. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Never. How long can you stall them? \nNANCY They know you want this done quickly, so they're going to expect a quick counter offer. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I need two days. Wait two days before getting back to them. If they call, tell them it's a big number, I'm thinking about it. \nNANCY Okay. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD And the picture he wanted... \nShe slams the frame of Jesse's photo against the inside of a metal trash can. \nNancy winces and then smiles at the sound of shattering glass. \nAtwood plucks the photo out of the frame and tears it so that the rip can be heard over the phone. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD ... tell him I couldn't find it. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 MORNING \nMr. Brooks is still asleep. Emma, dressed for the day, arrives at his side of the bed. She rubs the back of Mr. Brooks' hand. \nEMMA Earl... Earl... \nMr. Brooks opens his eyes. \nMR. BROOKS (sleepy, groggy) Huh?... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nEMMA Roger is on the phone. \nINT. KITCHEN \u00d1 BROOKS HOUSE - MORNING \nIn his slippers and robe, Mr. Brooks is standing in the Doorway watching Jane who is leaning over the Counter with an open Newspaper next to a bowl of cereal. \nHe has a chance to take a good long look before she feels his presence and raises her head. \nJANE Oh, Hi, Daddy, I thought you'd already be gone. \nMR. BROOKS Roger called. There was another murder last night near Stanford. \nJANE Oh... \nMR. BROOKS Done the same way as the one they talked to you about. Right down to the hatchet being left at the scene. \nJane can't quite conceal the tremor of surprise that ripples through her and Mr. Brooks sees it. \nMR. BROOKS They think they have a serial killer. Obviously you were here last night, so you're in the clear. \nJANE That's good news, isn't it? I mean even if you're innocent it's good news to know you're not a suspect. \nMR. BROOKS Oh, yeah. How's the morning sickness? Do you want to ride in with me today? \nJANE I feel fine, but I don't know how long that will last. \nMr. Brooks nods, turns to leave, then turns back. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. BROOKS Do you love me, Jane? \nJANE Of course I love you, daddy, you're my father. \nMR. BROOKS Have you decided whether or not to keep the baby? \nJANE Not yet. \nMR. BROOKS (nods) Okay. \nEXT. MR. SMITH'S CAR \u00d1 AFTERNOON \nLooking off the grill as it overtakes another car in the Fastlane. \nEminem is on the stereo. The car ahead moves out of the way. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD This is my case, what you're doing is fucked. But since I can't stop you, and she won't, here's a tip. James Baffert, you should stake him out, he knows something. \nDETECTIVE LONGNECKER We have some other ideas we are looking into. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Then what's the problem? You do that and I'll tail Baffert. \nDETECTIVE LONGNECKER Thank you for all your good work, Detective. This is our case now. \nAtwood looks from one Man to the Other. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Good luck. (to Captain Lister) Later I suppose you'll fill me in on what I'm supposed to be doing around here. I'm confused. \nShe leaves. Snyder closes the door behind her. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA - BROOKS BOX FACTORY - LATE EVENING \nIt's deserted with only a small spill of light coming from Mr. Brooks' Office. \nINSIDE \nMr. Brooks is at his desk. \nThe lamp at his elbow throws a yellow cone across his face. His head is in his hands, he's been crying. \nMarshall steps out of the shadows behind him. \nMARSHALL It's time to go. \nMR. BROOKS Yeah. \nHe reaches into a bottom drawer and as he takes out an envelope, Marshall reads the tear-stained hand written letter resting on the blotter. \nMARSHALL Dear Emma and Jane, my loves, I have a terminal illness and instead of subjecting you to my deterioration, I have decided to disappear. Don't try to find me, I don't want to be found. Please believe that the time I spent with you brought me the greatest joy of my life. Love. Dad. \nMr. Brooks picks up the letter and folds it. \nMARSHALL So you're going to go through with it. \nMr. Brooks stuffs the letter in the envelope, seals it and picks up a pen. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. BROOKS It's all planned to work out, Marshall. \nOn the envelope he writes: For EMMA and JANE. \nEXT. STREET \u00d1 NIGHT \nOn the sidewalk Mr. Smith is walking toward the on-coming traffic. The headlights make it difficult to tell one car from the other until they pass. That doesn't keep him from looking for Mr. Brooks. \nThe houses stop and he's passing a pocket park. In a dark space between the street lamps, a hand falls on Mr. Smith's shoulder. He jumps and a scream squeaks out of his throat. It's Mr. Brooks, in his Pottery-Throwing clothes. \nMR. BROOKS (smiles) Are you ready to rock and roll, Mr. Smith? \nMr. Smith swallows hard and nods. Mr. Brooks propels him into the park. \nINT. MR. BROOKS' CAR \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks is driving. Mr. Smith is in the passenger seat. Both are lost in a wary silence. Abruptly from the back seat: \nMARSHALL I smell gun oil, a gun oil that's different than yours. \nMR. BROOKS He brought his gun. After he gets what he wants he plans to kill me. \nMARSHALL Ah... now I get it. You were counting on that, weren't you? \nMR. BROOKS It has a certain logic. \nMARSHALL But if your plan is to have him kill you, why do you have to kill someone else first? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. BROOKS He'll need to see that to get up the courage to kill me. \nMarshall roars with laughter. \nMARSHALL Not even you believe that, Earl. It makes it more exciting, doesn't it, to think he's going to kill you after you kill someone else. You're getting your rocks off big time, that's why you're doing it. \nMR. BROOKS Not true... and if it were, so what? (to Mr. Smith) You're goddamn great, you know. To have the balls to do this. \nMR. SMITH I'm pretty nervous but that's normal right? \nMR. BROOKS Perfectly normal. \nINT. DETECTIVE ATWOOD'S CONDOMINIUM \u00d1 NIGHT \nAtwood is propped up in bed reading a Magazine. Her hair is pulled back and her face glistens with Cold Cream. \nThe phone rings. Should she answer it? It rings again, then again. Reluctantly she grabs the receiver. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Hello... Oh, yes, yes. (she sits up) Put him through... Hi, this is Detective Atwood speaking, thanks for calling...Yes, your roommate said you were in Tokyo... Anything, if you saw anything at all it might be helpful. \nSheila gives him a quick kiss and moves on into the LIVING ROOM where she drops her briefcase on the couch. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nSHEILA If we go to court, best case, two, if she wants to settle, best case, three, but I would be happy with two seven. \nBacklit by the Fireplace, Jesse kisses her again. \nFrom the KITCHEN, Mr. Brooks and Mr. Smith watch Jesse unzip Sheila's slacks and dropping to his knees peel them off her legs. \nShe steps out of them. He kisses the inside of her thighs, her crotch, then standing up: \nJESSE I'll be right back. \nOn his way out of the LIVING ROOM: \nJESSE I think we should hold firm for three. \nHe shuts off the light. In the glow of the Fireplace, Sheila removes her jacket. \nSHEILA Let's not be piggish, two five, two seven, would be a good deal. \nThe T.V. goes silent. Jesse returns with a partially full glass of Champagne. \nHe hands Sheila a glass from a side table, takes a bottle out of an ice bucket and as he fills her glass: \nSHEILA (teasing) You've already had half a bottle. \nJESSE You're late; if we want it, there's more. \nThey clink glasses. \nSHEILA To us. \nJESSE To three million dollars. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nSHEILA (after a sip) We have to do this fast because remember, Marie is meeting us here. \nJESSE We could ask her to join us. \nSHEILA Not funny. \nJESSE (undoing the front of her bra) I wasn't trying to be. \nShe bops him playfully. He bends and slips a nipple into his mouth. Sheila bites her lip and moans. \nIn the KITCHEN, Mr. Smith shifts around for a better view. The floor under him CRREEEKKS! \nIn the LIVING ROOM, both Sheila and Jesse react to the sound. \nSHEILA Are we alone? \nJESSE Yeah. \nMr. Brooks seems to appear magically out of the darkened Kitchen with his gun raised. He's followed by Mr. Smith. Sheila opens her mouth to scream. \nMR. BROOKS Don't do that. \nINT. MR. SMITH'S APARTMENT BUILDING \u00d1 NIGHT \nDetective Atwood hurries down the HALL and out of breath, stops in front of Mr. Smith's door. She raps sharply. Waits a bare three seconds and raps again. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Mr. Baffert?... Mr. Baffert? \nThe door of the Apartment behind her opens and an OLDER WOMAN sticks her head out. \nOLDER WOMAN He's gone. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAtwood shows her badge. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Do you have any idea when he'll be back? \nOLDER WOMAN He skipped out. I heard him leave this evening and a few minutes later there were Movers here. Musta been behind on the rent. He didn't even say good-bye. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Thank you. \nAs the Old Lady watches, Atwood tries the knob. It's unlocked. She pushes the door open. \nThe HALLWAY and LIVING ROOM she can see are completely empty. Furniture, T.V., camera equipment, art, gone. \nOLDER WOMAN I told you. \nINT. MR. SMITH'S APARTMENT \u00d1 NIGHT \nOn her way in, Atwood draws her gun. \nKeeping close to the walls she audits the KITCHEN. All the Cabinet doors are open. Dishes, pots and pans, cutlery, gone. \nShe moves on to the BATHROOM. Soap, shampoo, toilet paper, toothpaste, toothbrushes, towels, washcloths, the contents of the Medicine Cabinet, gone. \nCONTINUED: \nMR. SMITH Not now. Take the next off ramp. \nMR. BROOKS That wouldn't be very smart of me would it? \nHe accelerates around a truck into the Fastlane. Mr. Smith can see the Exit coming up, it's quickly left behind. \nMR. BROOKS (matter of fact) Think about this. You pissed yourself back there, you left your DNA at the scene of a double homicide, and there's nothing to indicate that I was ever there. If the Cops do an analysis of that urine, and they will, you're the Thumbprint Killer. \nMR. SMITH (smug) No. I still have pictures of you doing the first murder. \nMr. Brooks smiles a knowing smile. Beyond him on the other side of the Divider, cars are zipping by in the opposite direction. \nMR. BROOKS Yes. But what were you doing at the second murder? \nMr. Smith doesn't have an answer for that. \nMR. BROOKS Let me help you with a thought. You say I forced you to come along and if I'm not here or more specifically my body is not here to say different, you might have a chance to beat the rap. Now you're probably asking yourself why I would help you. I'm tired, Mr. Smith, I'm tired of killing. But I'm an addict, I can't quit. I've tried. I can't do it on my own. So I'll let you kill me but I want you to do it smart, in a way that I disappear and my family never knows what I was. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMR. SMITH How do I do that? \nMR. BROOKS There's a cemetery I know about. We find an open grave, you shoot me, I fall in the grave, you shovel in just enough earth to cover me, tomorrow a casket is lowered onto me and I've disappeared. It's a good plan. What do you say?... \nMR. SMITH Why should I trust you? \nMR. BROOKS You don't have to trust me. You're the man holding the gun, you saw me put mine in the trunk. \nMR. SMITH I don't know. You really want me to kill you? \nMR. BROOKS Yes. \nMR. SMITH Okay... But any sudden moves and you're dead on the spot and I'll make sure your family knows what you are. \nMR. BROOKS I understand. \nEXT. OLD DECO BUILDING \u00d1 NIGHT \nCome off the banner hanging across the front - ROOMS FOR RENT, to find Atwood walking away from her car. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD (to herself, regarding the Building) You've come down in the world, Mr. Baffert. \nINT. LOBBY - OLD DECO BUILDING \u00d1 NIGHT \nHigh ceilings, once grand, now blue neon and a cage around the Front Desk to protect the Night Clerk who is nowhere in sight. Somewhere a radio is playing salsa music loud. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAtwood crosses to the elevator. She pushes the call button. With an arthritic rattle the door opens. \nINT. ELEVATOR \u00d1 NIGHT \nAtwood selects the 5th Floor. Creek!, Clatter!, Clank!, the door closes and after a stuttering liftoff the car begins its ascent. The overhead light flickers on and off. Atwood looks up at it. \nEXT. SIDEWALK \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks leads Mr. Smith across a street to a pedestrian gate set in a high wall. \nThrough the bars of the gate we can see a Cemetery bathed in moonlight. \nMr. Brooks reaches into his pocket. Mr. Smith tightens his grip on the gun. \nMR. SMITH Uh uh, take your hand out real slow. \nMr. Brooks does as he's told. A key dangles from his fingers. \nMR. BROOKS It's locked. You don't want to climb over, do you? \nMR. SMITH What are you doing with a key to a cemetery? \nMR. BROOKS I own it. \nMR. SMITH Why do you own a cemetery? \nMr. Brooks unlocks the gate and preceding Mr. Smith, goes inside. \nMR. BROOKS You always want to invest in things people can't do without. Water and cemeteries are pretty safe. \nHe locks the gate and handing the key to Mr. Smith: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. BROOKS You'll need this to get out. Now there should be an open grave around here somewhere. Let's see if we can find it. \nHe produces a small flashlight from his pocket and off they go. \nINT. OLD DECO BUILDING \u00d1 NIGHT \nRepeating their arthritic performance the elevator doors open. Atwood steps out into a wide sporadically lit HALLWAY. \nPeering at the numbers Atwood goes to her Left. \nMR. BROOKS Okay, let's get this over with. \nMr. Smith raises his gun and points it at Mr. Brooks's head. He hesitates. \nMR. BROOKS I'll close my eyes. \nHe does. Mr. Smith pulls the trigger. \nClick! \nMr. Smith looks in horror at the malfunctioning gun. Mr. Brooks opens his eyes. Mr. Smith aims the gun again. \nClick!... Click! \nMR. BROOKS I'm sorry. \nAs he talks he counters around until Mr. Smith is the one with his back to the open Grave. \nMR. BROOKS I really did want you to kill me. But in case at the last minute I changed my mind, I returned to your apartment and bent the firing pin on your gun. \nHe wrenches the shovel out of a mound of waiting earth. Mr. Smith tries to fire the gun at Mr. Brooks again. \nCLICK!... CLICK! \nMR. BROOKS In fact I even brought another gun for you so you could finish me if I had decided to go through with it. \nHe opens his jacket and shows Mr. Smith the gun. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMR. BROOKS Unfortunately for you, my daughter is pregnant and just before you pulled the trigger, I realized how much I want to see the end to that story. \nMR. SMITH (dry mouth) If you do anything to me, if you touch one hair on my head, the Police will find the pictures of you killing that Couple. \nMR. BROOKS The contents of your safety deposit box, Mr. Smith, have vanished. \nWithout warning, Mr. Brooks swings the shovel. The force of the blow breaks Mr. Smith's left arm. He howls. \nThe next blow comes almost immediately. It smashes into the left side of Mr. Smith's head. \nThe screams stop and a misfiring set of neurons causes Mr. Smith to stand up straight and wobbling, look directly at Mr. Brooks. \nThe blood streaming down his face is black in the moonlight. \nMr. Brooks takes a step to the side, cocks his wrists and swings again. His full weight is behind this one. \nThe blade of the shovel strikes Mr. Smith in the throat very nearly taking off his head. The flesh that was once Mr. Smith falls to the ground. \nMR. BROOKS (looking down at the corpse) Before I was the Thumbprint Killer, Mr. Smith, I killed a lot of people in a lot of different ways. \nINT. GRAVE \u00d1 NIGHT \nLooking up. Mr. Smith's body is rolled over the edge. It falls on top of us. \nEXT. CEMETERY \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks takes a shovel of dirt from the pile and whistling 'By The Light Of The Silvery Moon', begins the task of covering Mr. Smith. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP \u00d1 MORNING \nA Newspaper is lying unfolded on the Counter next to the remnants of a breakfast. \nThe headline reads - NATIONWIDE MANHUNT FOR THUMBPRINT KILLER - Under that headline is a large picture of Mr. Smith aka Mr. Baffert. \nIn the lower right corner is another headline to a story - Murder Suicide For The Hangman -. \nThe reader of the paper is Mr. Brooks. On a stool next to him, Marshall is also reading. \nMARSHALL It says here the Thumbprint Killer is a monster... annoys you a little bit that you can't take credit, doesn't it? \nMR. BROOKS Anyone who is good at what they do, wants recognition. But since I'm not going to do it anymore, I'll let Mr. Smith take the credit. \nMARSHALL Don't kid yourself, Earl, you're going to kill again. \nMR. BROOKS No, I'm not. I'll continue the AA meetings and I'll control it. \nOn the other stool next to Mr. Brooks is a WOMAN. Her large purse hangs open from the back of the stool; the cel phone clearly visible inside. Mr. Brooks looks at the phone. \nMR. BROOKS But there is an answer I would like to have. \nINT. POLICE STATION \u00d1 MORNING \nDetective Atwood is seated in her CUBICLE reading the same front page Mr. Brooks was reading. A FELLOW OFFICER stops in the door. \nOFFICER Good work, Atwood. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Thanks, Tom. \nHe moves on. From off screen: \nANOTHER OFFICER You should ask the FBI to kiss your ass and buy you a Cadillac. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD I like my ass too much for that. \nSnyder comes in and holds up the Work Order from the Moving Company. \nSNYDER This is bogus.

Why do you fight it so hard, Earl? \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) Courage to change the things I can... \nMARSHALL (V.O.) Come on, you've been a good boy for a long time, you deserve a little fun. \nOur view moves back up to the Woman's breasts. \nDISSOLVE THROUGH THIS TO: \nEARL BROOKS' reflection in a mirror. Earl, in his 40's, has on a tuxedo. He's in front of a sink in a Public Bathroom and he's whispering to his image. \nMR. BROOKS ... and Wisdom to know the difference. \nPicking up speed against the hunger in his head: \nMR.

BROOKS (V.O.) (even faster now) ... Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it. Trusting that He will make all things right if I surrender to His will. That I may be reasonably happy in this life, And supremely happy with Him forever in the next. Amen. \nThe Man at the microphone raises his arms to quiet the Audience. \nMAN I could go on and on about what a great guy Earl is, how he cuts his toe nails... \nEveryone laughs. \nMAN ... how he gives freely of his time and money, but let's get Earl up here to speak for himself. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you a businessman, a philanthropist, a great friend and the Evanston Chamber of Commerce Man of the Year... Mr. Earl Brooks. \nMr. Brooks kisses Emma, stands and after accepting congratulations along the way, arrives at the podium. \nMR. BROOKS Thank you all very much. The first thing I would like to say is... I don't even know how I cut my toe nails. \nApplause and laughter from the Audience. \nMR.

God grant me the Serenity to accept... \nEMMA The only thing that would have made this evening more perfect is if Jane had been here. \nMR. BROOKS She called.

This is MARSHALL. He's 50 plus. \nEmma can neither see nor hear him. Marshall exists only in Mr. Brooks's mind. \nMARSHALL Come on, Earl, give yourself a break, you know you want to do this. \nMR. BROOKS No. \nMARSHALL You're the fucking 'man of the year', you deserve it. It's not like it's not set up. You already know how to by-pass the alarm, you know how to pick the locks. Tonight's the perfect night. \nMR. BROOKS (over his shoulder) No, Marshall, I said 'no'! \nMARSHALL I heard you, Earl, but you don't mean 'no'. \nEmma feels Mr. Brooks's distance. \nEMMA What's the matter? \nMr. Brooks pulls himself back into the moment. \nMR. BROOKS Nothing. \nEMMA You were frowning. \nMR. BROOKS I was thinking of what I didn't say in the speech. \nEMMA They laughed, they were touched, I don't think anyone felt left out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARSHALL (from the back seat) They have their dance class tonight. What if we go by and just look at them. There's no harm in just having a look. \nMR. BROOKS No means 'no', Marshall. \nMARSHALL Please... pretty please. \nMR. BROOKS (to Emma) The food tonight was very good, but I wasn't crazy about the dessert. Would you like to stop somewhere and get something sweet? \nINT. ICE CREAM PARLOR \u00d1 NIGHT \nIn a booth, Mr. Brooks and Emma are sharing a Sundae. Mr. Brooks steals a look at the Arthur Murray dance class that is taking place behind the full-length windows fronting the second floor of the Building across the street. \nEMMA ... Labradors are supposed to be nice, or maybe a rescue mutt... \nMR. BROOKS The Pound's a pretty sad place; if you want me to, I'll go with you. \nEMMA There's an Irish Lab I read about, and I think the breeder is... \nMr. Brooks turns his attention back to the Dancers and again Emma's voice fades to a murmur. \nBoth Mr. Brooks and Marshall who is seated on the other side of Emma are focused on one particular COUPLE. \nThe Man and Woman are not great dancers nor are they especially attractive, but Mr. Brooks and Marshall are fascinated with them. \nMarshall leans forward and looking slyly around Emma at Mr. Brooks: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARSHALL I bet your dick's getting hard, isn't it, just imagining what they would look like dead? \nSavoring the ice-cream, Mr. Brooks nods. \nEXT. BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT \nTwo story modern. Not ostentatious, but the elegance of the line and the grounds say there's big money here. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThrough the door of the DRESSING AREA, Emma can be seen taking off her evening clothes. \nHidden by the darkness on the other side of the bed, Mr. Brooks is hunched forward on a chair, his head in his hands. His bow tie is undone, but he's still wearing his Tuxedo. In obvious torment, he is whispering to himself. \nMR. BROOKS ... I can't do this, I can't do this, I can't do this, please don't let me do this, God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change... \nIn the DRESSING AREA \nEmma is putting on her sleep-wear.

If I'm not awake, wake me when you come back. \nMr. Brooks comes forward, puts his arms around Emma and hugs her, then easing back, kisses her. \nMR.

If you were honest you would step out there and say 'Hi, I'm Earl. I killed two people last night and I really got off on it, but I need your help to be cured.' \nMR. BROOKS I'm different Marshall, I won't argue that with you. This is the only place that has ever helped me be normal and I've been straight up until last night for the past two years. I'm not going to kill again and I'm not going to quit coming here because it upsets you. \nMARSHALL Yeah but for the next 29 days you're going to have to step out there and say 'Hi, I'm Earl, I'm an addict.' And everybody will know you fell off the wagon. Don't you feel stupid doing that? \nMR. BROOKS No. I feel good. \nEXT. INDUSTRIAL SECTION OF CHICAGO \u00d1 DAY \nA Cab arrives at the Front Entrance of the BROOKS BOX FACTORY, a long three story brick Building. \nA YOUNG WOMAN, 19, is dropped off along with an assortment of luggage and boxes. \nINT. BROOKS BOX FACTORY \u00d1 DAY \nIt's loud. We follow a thin piece of cardboard as one machine deals it off the bottom of a stack into the maw of another machine. \nThat machine prints one side of the cardboard blue. \nIt is handed off to the third machine which cuts the flaps. The fourth machine folds and glues those flaps and spits the piece of cardboard out onto a conveyor belt as a box. \nWearing safety glasses and ear protectors along with his business suit, Mr. Brooks picks up the box and hands it to one of three similarly attired MEN, standing nearby. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. BROOKS This is not the top of the line or the bottom, but for the money we're talking about this is the quality I can provide you. \nAs Mr. Brooks talks the Men pass the box between them. \nMR. BROOKS Your packaging is the first impression your customers will have of your product... \nPA SYSTEM Mr. Brooks, your daughter is waiting for you in your office. \nA surprised Mr. Brooks grabs a quick look at the PA Speaker, then continues. \nMR. BROOKS ... We'd love to work you with on the design. It's fun to challenge our machines. If you check around, you'll find we're not the cheapest, but we are the best. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA - BROOKS BOX FACTORY \u00d1 DAY \nOn his way through to his office, Mr. Brooks smiles absently at a MAN waiting on the couch. The pleasant-looking Man in his early 30's, nods. \nMr. Brooks stops at his SECRETARY's desk. \nMR. BROOKS Sunday, did Jane call and say she was coming? \nSUNDAY I would have given you that message, Mr. Brooks. She has boxes and suitcases downstairs. \nMR. BROOKS Hold my calls. \nINT. MR.

BROOKS I can guess what you've done, but why don't you tell me and then I'll decide. \nJANE I dropped out of school. \nMR. BROOKS Okay. Have you told your mother this? \nJANE No. I wanted to speak to you first. \nMR. BROOKS You'll have to tell her, I'm not going to do that for you, and then together the three of us will decide where to go from here. \nJANE I've thought a lot about this, Dad. College is a waste of time for me. \nMR. BROOKS I don't know how you know that half way through your Freshman year, but... \nJANE You didn't go to college, Dad, and you're successful. I want to come and work for you. \nSitting on the couch: \nMARSHALL She's not telling you everything, she's hiding something. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMR. BROOKS I know. (to Jane) I'm not hiring right now. \nJANE Just listen to me. What would happen to the business if, God forbid, something happened to you? Mom would probably have to sell to strangers. I'm willing to start at the bottom, you can treat me as a regular employee, I want to learn everything there is to know about running the box business, and then when the time comes, the business would stay in the family. \nMR. BROOKS That's sweet, but you're talking about emotion, not business. In fact your mother and I came very close to selling out last year. \nJANE What?! \nMR. BROOKS If we had been offered a little more money, and they may come back to us, we will sell. \n", "test2_true": "There's a knock on the door. \nMR. BROOKS Yes? \nSunday, the secretary, comes in and crossing to Mr. Brooks: \nSUNDAY I'm sorry, I know you didn't want to be disturbed, the Man in the waiting room insisted I give you this. \nShe hands Mr. Brooks a letter-size envelope. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nSUNDAY He said you would find what's inside very interesting. \nMR.

Slicing the flap of the envelope, Mr. Brooks picks up with Jane. \nMR. BROOKS Part of spending the four years in college is to... \nMr. Brooks can now see the contents of the envelope. \nTwo snapshot-size PHOTOS taken with a high speed digital camera. One shows the right side of Mr. Brooks's cheek. \nHe is in no way identifiable, but that blur of flesh appears to be looking at the dead dance Couple. \nThe second Photo is a clear shot of Mr. Brooks closing the curtains with the dead dance Couple behind him. \nNeither Mr. Brooks's voice or his face betray the enormity of what he's looking at. \nMR. BROOKS ... eh... to give yourself the chance to find out who you are and what you want to do. \nJANE I'll talk to Mom, but I'm not going back to school. \nMR.

BROOKS Sunday, would you show the gentleman who gave you the envelope to the conference room, and tell him I'll meet him there and... (to Jane) What happened to the BMW? \nJANE A friend is driving it across country, it'll be here next weekend. \nMR. BROOKS (to Sunday, through Intercom) And get Jane a cab. \nHe picks up the phone and holds it out to Jane. \nMR. BROOKS Call your mother. \nJANE Are you going to give me a job? \nMR. BROOKS If it were up to me, and I think your mother will agree with this, you should go back to school. \nINT. HALLWAY - BROOKS BOX FACTORY \u00d1 DAY \nMr. Brooks comes around the corner. He's raving at Marshall who's walking beside him. \nMR. BROOKS You see all of this?! The factory, the houses, the cars, the money, the respect!!... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA different angle in the same hallway shows Mr. Brooks walking away from us. A passing EMPLOYEE crosses him. The Men nod to each other. Marshall is nowhere in sight. \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) ... I like them! I don't want to lose them! \nAnd then we're back to the original angle and Marshall is again in the picture. \nMR. BROOKS ... That's why I didn't want to do the dance Couple! \nMARSHALL Stop your fucking whining, Earl, you enjoyed doing that Couple just as much as I did, and look on the bright side, he came to us he didn't go to the Cops. If he tries to shake us down we kill him. Period. We make it fun but we kill him. End of story. \nINT. CONFERENCE ROOM - BROOKS BOX FACTORY \u00d1 DAY \nThe Man from the Reception Area is nervously admiring a display of Mr. Brooks's ceramic pieces.

SMITH No. I have other copies and other photos, and if something were to happen to me... \nMR. BROOKS How did you find me, Mr. Smith? \nMR. SMITH You're 'Man of the Year', Mr. Brooks. Your picture was in the paper. If it hadn't been, I don't know what I would have done. \nMR. BROOKS Lucky me. What is it that I can help you with? \nMR. SMITH I've been watching that Couple for months, they liked to make love with the blinds open. Sometimes I would take pictures, you know, visual aides for later. It was fun, it was a great way to get off; I thought, until I saw you kill them. I have to tell you I have never ever felt a rush like that ever. I know you're the Thumbprint killer, you've done this before. What I want is to go with you the next time you kill someone. And I would like that to be soon. \nFrom the end of the table, Marshall cackles a laugh. \nMARSHALL And you were worried that this was going to be unpleasant. The answer is simple. Just tell him you've decided never to kill again and he'll go away. \nMR. BROOKS You enjoy watching me suffer, don't you? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARSHALL In a word, yes. \nMR. BROOKS Where do you think he has the other pictures? \nMARSHALL He put them in a safety deposit box but I'll bet the box is at the bank where he has his checking account and the key is on his keychain. He really wants to do this, he's not going to go to the cops. \nMr. Smith who has grown uneasy under Mr. Brooks's stare swallows: \nMR. SMITH So do we have a deal? \nMR. BROOKS From the angle of these pictures... (taps the envelope) ... you live on the third floor of the apartment building across the alley from the Couple's house. \nMR. SMITH Well... eh. \nMR. BROOKS Yes or no, Mr. Smith? \nMr. Smith nods 'yes'. \nMR. BROOKS What time do you get home from work? \nMR. SMITH Six thirty, seven, depending on the traffic. \nMR. BROOKS You can never come here again, you can never call me. Do you understand that? \nMR. SMITH Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMR. BROOKS Tomorrow night, not tonight, tomorrow night, at eight o'clock, leave your apartment and walk east. I'll pick you up. \nMR. SMITH If you're thinking of doing anything to me, Mr. Brooks... \nMR. BROOKS We're both aware of the rules, Mr. Smith, but I feel I must warn you. If it turns out that you enjoy killing, it can become very addictive. It could ruin your life. \nMR. SMITH I want to do this. \nMR. BROOKS (looks at Marshall) Have I covered everything? \nMARSHALL I can't think of anything else. \nMr. Brooks stands up and opens the door. \nMR. BROOKS I'll see you tomorrow night, Mr. Smith. \nOn his way out, Mr. Smith nods. Mr. Brooks closes the door. His chin drops on his chest and he sighs. \nMR.

The Attorney slides a sheet of paper to Sheila. She turns it over. On it is written: \nASIAN ATTORNEY We can have a check for that amount in your office by 6 o'clock. \n", "test3_true": "GRAY-HAIRED ATTORNEY You know as well as I do, Counselor, if we go to court you're not going to get a million five. \nSHEILA I don't know. Let's see. \nShe holds up the front page of the Chicago Tribune. \"THE HANGMAN ESCAPES\" story is circled in red. \nSHEILA This is the front page of yesterday's paper... (reads) 'Hangman Escapes'... eh... now, here it is... 'after torturing the young women, Thorton Meeks would hang them in public places - church steeples, balconies, Freeway overpasses'...

Who's gonna pay me for that? \nASIAN ATTORNEY We don't need to get into this, Tracy. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Yes, we do. I was the one who paid for everything while we were married, and now I'm being asked to give him a bonus for spending time with me when I've already paid for it in the first place. \nJESSE (to Atwood) Tracy, this is not a lot of money for you, and you know how upset I was when Meeks said that he was going to escape and he would come back and kill you. \nSHEILA We're quite willing to find out what a court would think that mental anguish is worth. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Jesse... Darling?... you know the best thing that could happen to me right now? That you get hit by a truck and die. \nSHEILA (smiles) That's it! Mr. Vialo and I are leaving.

It felt good. \nINT. APARTMENT \u00d1 NIGHT \nMoonlight seeps around the blinds to reveal Mr. Smith asleep in bed. \nBeyond the open BEDROOM door down the hall is only darkness until the eruption of illumination from a penlight momentarily outlines the figure of a Man. \nThen we're looking at what the penlight sees. \nA keyring. Hands in surgical gloves isolate the - safety deposit key - and press it into a soft wax block where it leaves its impression. The light goes off. \nIn the BEDROOM at the end of the hallway, Mr. Smith begins to snore. The Figure coasts silently toward the sound. \nMr. Smith's face is sideways on the pillow. The snores and a little drool burbles out of the corner of his mouth. \nWHOOMP!! The impact of something landing on the bed bounces Mr. Smith upright and awake. \nMR. SMITH Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!! Ahhh!!! \nThe beam from the penlight hits him in the face. He raises his hands to shield his eyes. \nMR. BROOKS Don't worry, if I were here to kill you, you would already be dead. \nThe penlight leaves Mr. Smith and Mr. Brooks places it deliberately under his own chin casting long sinister shadows up his face. He's sitting on the bed next to Mr. Smith. \nMR. BROOKS After you left today, I realized our friendship was a little one- sided. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: MR. BROOKS (CONT'D) So when we meet tomorrow night would you be so kind as to bring all of the pictures and the memory card from your camera. That way we can like each other simply for who we are. If you don't show up, I will presume you've gone to the police and I will kill you. Even if I go to jail because of you, someone will find you wherever you are and kill you. \nThe penlight goes off. There's total silence. \nMR. SMITH (squeaks) Mr. Brooks?... \nHe squints into the black. \nMR. SMITH Mr. Brooks?... \nFinally he gathers the courage to extend a shaky hand. The bedside lamp goes on. The room is empty. Cautiously Mr. Smith swings his legs out of bed and stands up. \nHe forces himself to go to the door and from there curls his arm around the jamb into the darkness. \nThe HALL light is dazzling. \nA peek into the BATHROOM shows there is nobody there. He continues on into the LIVING ROOM. \nHis camera equipment is on the table. The tripod is still set up. There is no sign of Mr. Brooks. \nMr. Smith eyes the front door.

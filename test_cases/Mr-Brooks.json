{"test1_input": "MR BROOKS \nWritten by \nBruce A Evans & Raynold Gideon \nFADE IN: \nCLOSE on a Polaroid of a dimly lit COUPLE locked in a sexual embrace. We cannot see their faces. \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) (tortured) God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change... \nOur view travels sensuously down the Woman's naked torso to find the Man's head buried between her legs. \nMARSHALL (V.O.) Why do you fight it so hard, Earl? \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) Courage to change the things I can... \nMARSHALL (V.O.) Come on, you've been a good boy for a long time, you deserve a little fun. \nOur view moves back up to the Woman's breasts. \nDISSOLVE THROUGH THIS TO: \nEARL BROOKS' reflection in a mirror. Earl, in his 40's, has on a tuxedo. He's in front of a sink in a Public Bathroom and he's whispering to his image. \nMR. BROOKS ... and Wisdom to know the difference. \nPicking up speed against the hunger in his head: \nMR. BROOKS (CONT'D) Living one day at a time, Enjoying one moment at a time, Accepting hardship as a pathway to peace... \nFrom far away comes the sound of applause. \nINT. BALLROOM - NIGHT \nMEN in tuxedos and WOMEN in gowns. \nMr. Brooks is seated at one of the front tables with his wife, EMMA, also 40's. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nThe audience's hands are coming together for what a MAN at the microphone has just said. \nMr. Brooks is smiling but not clapping; and although his lips don't move we can hear: \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) (even faster now) ... Taking, as He did, this sinful world as it is, not as I would have it. Trusting that He will make all things right if I surrender to His will. That I may be reasonably happy in this life, And supremely happy with Him forever in the next. Amen. \nThe Man at the microphone raises his arms to quiet the Audience. \nMAN I could go on and on about what a great guy Earl is, how he cuts his toe nails... \nEveryone laughs. \nMAN ... how he gives freely of his time and money, but let's get Earl up here to speak for himself. Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you a businessman, a philanthropist, a great friend and the Evanston Chamber of Commerce Man of the Year... Mr. Earl Brooks. \nMr. Brooks kisses Emma, stands and after accepting congratulations along the way, arrives at the podium. \nMR. BROOKS Thank you all very much. The first thing I would like to say is... I don't even know how I cut my toe nails. \nApplause and laughter from the Audience. \nMR. BROOKS Twenty years ago when I started the Brooks Box Factory I never dreamed I would one day be standing here. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nA silver Lexus LS 430 glides past us. \nEMMA (V.O.) Did you see Sis Wallace's dress? \nINT. LEXUS \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks is driving. Emma is in the passenger seat. They're holding hands. \nEMMA You could see her nipples. At her age she should keep those things hidden. \nMr. Brooks is only listening to his Wife with one ear and underneath what she is saying we can barely hear: \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) God grant me the Serenity to accept... \nEMMA The only thing that would have made this evening more perfect is if Jane had been here. \nMR. BROOKS She called. She has mid terms coming up. \nEMMA She's dropping out, you know. \nMR. BROOKS We'll see. \nEMMA Nothing she does is wrong to you, is it?... \nMr. Brooks doesn't rise to the bait. \nEMMA Well she missed a good party... \nAs she continues, we look at Mr. Brooks and Emma's voice fades to a murmur. \n(CONTINUED) \n", "test1_true": "In the back seat, a Man leans out from behind Mr. Brooks's head. This is MARSHALL. He's 50 plus. \nEmma can neither see nor hear him. Marshall exists only in Mr. Brooks's mind. \nMARSHALL Come on, Earl, give yourself a break, you know you want to do this. \nMR. BROOKS No. \nMARSHALL You're the fucking 'man of the year', you deserve it. It's not like it's not set up. You already know how to by-pass the alarm, you know how to pick the locks. Tonight's the perfect night. \nMR. BROOKS (over his shoulder) No, Marshall, I said 'no'! \nMARSHALL I heard you, Earl, but you don't mean 'no'. \nEmma feels Mr. Brooks's distance. \nEMMA What's the matter? \nMr. Brooks pulls himself back into the moment. \nMR. BROOKS Nothing. \nEMMA You were frowning. \nMR. BROOKS I was thinking of what I didn't say in the speech. \nEMMA They laughed, they were touched, I don't think anyone felt left out. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMARSHALL (from the back seat) They have their dance class tonight. What if we go by and just look at them. There's no harm in just having a look. \nMR. BROOKS No means 'no', Marshall. \nMARSHALL Please... pretty please. \nMR. BROOKS (to Emma) The food tonight was very good, but I wasn't crazy about the dessert. Would you like to stop somewhere and get something sweet? \nINT. ICE CREAM PARLOR \u00d1 NIGHT \nIn a booth, Mr. Brooks and Emma are sharing a Sundae. Mr. Brooks steals a look at the Arthur Murray dance class that is taking place behind the full-length windows fronting the second floor of the Building across the street. \nEMMA ... Labradors are supposed to be nice, or maybe a rescue mutt... \nMR. BROOKS The Pound's a pretty sad place; if you want me to, I'll go with you. \nEMMA There's an Irish Lab I read about, and I think the breeder is... \nMr. Brooks turns his attention back to the Dancers and again Emma's voice fades to a murmur. \nBoth Mr. Brooks and Marshall who is seated on the other side of Emma are focused on one particular COUPLE. \nThe Man and Woman are not great dancers nor are they especially attractive, but Mr. Brooks and Marshall are fascinated with them. \nMarshall leans forward and looking slyly around Emma at Mr. Brooks: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARSHALL I bet your dick's getting hard, isn't it, just imagining what they would look like dead? \nSavoring the ice-cream, Mr. Brooks nods. \nEXT. BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT \nTwo story modern. Not ostentatious, but the elegance of the line and the grounds say there's big money here. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThrough the door of the DRESSING AREA, Emma can be seen taking off her evening clothes. \nHidden by the darkness on the other side of the bed, Mr. Brooks is hunched forward on a chair, his head in his hands. His bow tie is undone, but he's still wearing his Tuxedo. In obvious torment, he is whispering to himself. \nMR. BROOKS ... I can't do this, I can't do this, I can't do this, please don't let me do this, God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change... \nIn the DRESSING AREA \nEmma is putting on her sleep-wear. Mr. Brooks steps into the doorway. \nMR. BROOKS I'm going to stay up a while, maybe go to the studio and play with some glazes. \nEMMA Okay, I'm going to read. If I'm not awake, wake me when you come back. \nMr. Brooks comes forward, puts his arms around Emma and hugs her, then easing back, kisses her. \nMR. BROOKS I thought you were wonderful tonight. \nEXT. THE BROOKS HOUSE \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks exits the back door and starts down a path that leads away from the house. \nMR. BROOKS (to himself) Don't do this, don't do this, please don't do this, don't do this, don't do, please don't do this... \nHe passes through a screen of trees and arrives at a small beautiful industrial-looking Building. \nNo windows except for a narrow strip on three sides just under the edge of the roof. \n", "test1_id": 2520, "test2_input": "Mr. Brooks lets himself in with a key. \nINT. BUILDING \u00d1 NIGHT \nExquisitely unique handmade handglazed bowls, vases, cups, plates are scattered haphazardly on shelves and tables around the room. \nThis is Mr. Brooks's CERAMICS STUDIO. \nMr. Brooks turns on the big industrial kiln and sets the temperature, then in a series of quick cuts changes out of his tuxedo into his work clothes which he selects from a dozen identical pairs of khaki shirts and pants hanging in a closet. \nBelow the pants and shirts are a dozen pairs of identical leather work shoes. The windbreaker he puts on is also from a dozen identical windbreakers. \nHe takes a set of car keys off a hook next to a door which opens into a garage. Under the light is an older model non- descript Toyota. \nEXT. CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 NIGHT \nThe Toyota backs into an alley and with the garage door closing behind it, pulls away. \nINT. TOYOTA \u00d1 NIGHT \nMarshall is up front with Mr. Brooks. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARSHALL Oh Lordy, Earl my boy, I've missed this! We are going to have so much fun! \nMR. BROOKS This is the last time, Marshall. Understand me?! The very last time! \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET \u00d1 NIGHT \nA mixture of modest houses and apartment buildings. Mr. Brooks's Toyota is parked in the semi-dark cast by a tree. \nWe rise over the car, over the trees, over the houses to the other side of the block and come down to find Mr. Brooks working the lock on the side door of a small BUNGALOW. \nHe has on surgical gloves. \nThe pick is extracted, the handle turned. The door opens. There's a chain. \nMr. Brooks removes a pair of bent rubber tipped forceps from a pocket, inserts it in the chain, pulls the door to, gives the tool a twist and gently pushes the door inward. \nThe chain has been released. \nINT. BUNGALOW \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks quietly closes the door and holding his breath stands very still and listens. \nThere's a faint indistinct sound coming from the recesses of the house. \nMr. Brooks's feet glide out of the PANTRY. Now coming slightly behind him is another pair of legs encased in dark slacks. \nMove up; the person in the black slacks is Marshall. \nIn the middle of the KITCHEN, the sound is now recognizable. It's the moans of a Couple fucking. This disturbs Mr. Brooks, he hesitates. \nMarshall leans in and hisses fiercely in his ear. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMARSHALL Don't you dare quit on me, you piece of shit. I want to see what they're doing. \nMr. Brooks's spine stiffens and he's going forward again. \nEntering a HALLWAY, he reaches into his jacket. When his hand reappears it's inside a Ziplock bag, his fingers around the butt of a silenced pistol. \nHe brings the hand and bag to his mouth and tightens the Ziplock against his wrist. \nThe two Men arrive at a door that's slightly ajar. Behind it the sounds of the love-making are becoming more intense. \nMr. Brooks nudges the door with his foot. It opens enough for he and Marshall to see the Couple inside. \nThe Man and Woman from the Arthur Murray dance class are naked on the bed. \nAs much as Mr. Brooks hates himself for it he loves watching. He can now hear his heart beating in his ears. \nHe begins to breathe in unison with the Couple, but his expression is distant almost clinical. \nWhen the Couple climaxes, when they come, Mr. Brooks's face goes blank. \nOn the bed the Woman rolls off her Partner and the two of them lie there basking in the afterglow. \nBehind them Mr. Brooks pushes the door fully open and slips into the ROOM. They don't know he's there until he speaks. \nMR. BROOKS Hello. \nBoth the Man and Woman jump with surprise and look. The Woman screams and scrabbles at the sheet to cover herself. \nMAN What the fuck?! \nThen he sees the gun. \nMAN Hey, man, don't... \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \n", "test2_true": "In an attempt to get away, the Woman pushes herself back against the wall. She can't take her eyes off Mr. Brooks and she can't stop screaming. \nPOP! A hole appears above her left eye. The impact of Mr. Brooks's High Velocity .22 slug bounces her head off the wall. The screaming stops. \nThe Man opens his mouth and begins to shake. POP! The bullet through his brain makes him instantly dead and he crumples onto the Girl. \nMr. Brooks looks at what he's done. His nostrils flare at the scent of death. Then he moves, he's got work to do. On his way to the bed, the pistol goes into his pocket. \nMARSHALL (O.S.) (barks) Whoa, Earl, what the fuck is this?!! \nMr. Brooks snaps a look. \nThe curtains of the bedroom window are open; and over half of the Apartments in a four story Building on the other side of an alley can see into this room. \nMost of their windows are dark. And there's no one looking out of the windows that are lit. \nMARSHALL These pigs liked to fuck with the blinds open, you should have known that, Earl. This is a big mistake for you, Earl. \nMR. BROOKS (going to the window) Almost like I want to get caught, huh, Marshall? \nMARSHALL Well, don't fucking do that. I don't think either of us would enjoy spending the rest of our lives in jail or a lethal injection. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nMR. BROOKS Yes, sir. \nHe grabs a side of cloth in either hand and yanks the curtains closed. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE on a Polaroid of the dance Couple in a sexual pose. The attitude of the bodies is awkward and very reminiscent of the ones in the Polaroid we opened the movie with. \nINT. CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 NIGHT \nMr. Brooks is kneeling naked in front of the kiln where his murder clothes are being reduced to ash. \nArranged on the floor are Polaroids of the dance Couple in sexual positions. \nMR. BROOKS Please forgive me... Please forgive me... \nAs we look closer at the Photographs we realize by a smear of blood here and there and the distortion of the limbs that these tableaus were arranged after the Couple was killed. \nOne by one, Mr. Brooks picks up his souvenirs. He lingers over the last image; and from where he's sitting on the edge of a table: \nMARSHALL Don't even think about it. You know the rules. \nReluctantly Mr. Brooks throws the Polaroids into the fire of the kiln. \nMARSHALL Now go up and make love to your beautiful wife. \nHe leaves. In the kiln, the Polaroids burst into flame. \nEXT. MURDER HOUSE \u00d1 AFTERNOON \nThe sunlight exposes its charm. \nIf it weren't for the Police tape, the UNIFORMED OFFICERS, and the PLAINCLOTHES DETECTIVES, it looks like it would be a cool place to live. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nAn OLDER DETECTIVE, an African-American, comes out on the porch and calls to two other DETECTIVES who are drinking coffee on the lawn: \nOLDER DETECTIVE Where the fuck is Atwood?! \nYOUNG DETECTIVE I called ten minutes ago, they said she was on her way. \nOLDER DETECTIVE She doesn't get here soon, these bodies won't even be dead anymore? \nA Uniformed Cop standing guard at the tape: \nCOP You looking for the lady Cop? \nOLDER DETECTIVE Yeah. \nCOP She's here. She's been sitting in her car right over there for the last half hour. \nOLDER DETECTIVE Oh, Christ. \nEXT. ATWOOD'S CAR \u00d1 AFTERNOON \nSpecial Detective TRACY ATWOOD, somewhere in her 30's, is behind the wheel. The door is open. \nBy the expression on her face we might guess that Detective Atwood has simply forgotten to get out of the car. \nOn the seat next to her is a copy of the Chicago Tribune. The headline of a middle article on the first page reads: THE HANGMAN ESCAPES. \nMove up to Atwood's face. The Older Detective followed by the Younger Detective approaches. \nOLDER DETECTIVE You thinking of joining us anytime soon, Atwood? \nAtwood doesn't look at the Detectives for a long beat and when she does her expression is not friendly. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \n", "test2_id": 2521, "test3_input": "CONTINUED: (2) \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) God grant me the Serenity to accept the things I cannot change, Courage to change the things I can, and Wisdom to know the difference... \nINT. KITCHEN \u00d1 BROOKS HOUSE - DAY \nWith a shaky hand, Mr. Brooks raises the glass to his lips. \nMR. BROOKS God help me. What do I do? \nSitting on the island behind him Marshall waits for Mr. Brooks to gulp the glass dry. \nMARSHALL She did it, didn't she? \nMR. BROOKS Yeah. It'll take the Cops a week to ten days to put their case together and then they'll come back and arrest her. \nMARSHALL What are you going to do? \nMr. Brooks puts his hands over his eyes and sobs, then wiping away the tears: \nMR. BROOKS I've been afraid of this since the day she was born. She has what I have. \nMARSHALL Yes, she does. But you've always been smart about it. She was stupid. She did it because she got off on it, she did it for fun. Why didn't she think it through? A hatchet! And she left it there!! \nMR. BROOKS They were pretty graphic, weren't they? \nMARSHALL That was to shock her into making a mistake. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMR. BROOKS What does she think I think? Doesn't she remember what she told me? That the BMW was being driven across country by a friend and now right in front of me, she tells the Cops it was stolen. \nMARSHALL You've always cleaned up after her, whatever she did, all her life. \nMR. BROOKS If the BMW has anything incriminating in it, I hope it was stolen or she dropped it at the bottom of a very deep lake. \nMARSHALL Do you think she knows what kind of trouble she's in? \nMR. BROOKS I think she thought she had gotten away with it until the Cops showed up. I should have listened to her, it was there. She was telling me. 'I didn't quit school because I was pregnant'. I should have dug deeper. \nMARSHALL And where would you be but at the exact same place you are now. It is not your fault, Earl. Part of your problem with her is that you always think it is. \nMR. BROOKS She has what I have, Marshall. So on a very basic level, it is my fault. \nMARSHALL What are you going to do? \nMR. BROOKS Maybe the best thing for her would be to let her go to jail. \nMARSHALL And what about her child? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMR. BROOKS Emma and I would raise it. \nMARSHALL You might be right, Earl, you might be. Because you know if she's not stopped, she's going to do it again. And if she wants to take over the box business, the next victim could be you. \nMR. BROOKS I don't think she'd go that far. \nINT. CRIME LAB \u00d1 DAY \nA slide of what looks like enlarged grains of sand among giant carpet fibers is projected onto a screen. \nThe Lead Crime Lab Technician: \nSIGY (O.S.) We found traces of this in two places. \nThe slide changes to an overhead schematic showing the interior of the house where the dance Couple was murdered. \nDetective Atwood and Detective Snyder are standing with Sigy watching the presentation. Atwood has a bandage covering the stitches over her eye. \nSIGY (with a laser pointer) Here and here. \nThe red dot indicates an area just outside the Kitchen and just outside the Bedroom. \nSIGY We did an analysis and it's made up of feldspar, alumina and kaolin. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD What's that? \nSIGY A high fire stoneware clay. \nSNYDER Like you make ashtrays and vases from? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nSIGY This is more plates and teacups. It was slightly wet when whoever it was tracked it into the house and it stuck to the carpet fibers. We're thinking it was the killer. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD It could have been tracked in by a friend. \nSIGY That's the thing, you see, the friend would have had to have been there almost at the same time the killer was. Otherwise the samples would have been dry and the killer would have vacuumed them up. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD Is the clay rare, is it difficult to get? \nSIGY You can buy it almost anywhere. \n", "test3_true": "DETECTIVE ATWOOD And this is the only incongruity you were able to find in the whole house. \nSIGY We've done everything we know how to do. It sure doesn't break the case wide open, does it?. \nDETECTIVE ATWOOD No, Sigy, it doesn't. It does give me an excuse to ask someone some new questions. \nINT. MR. BROOKS' OFFICE \u00d1 BROOKS BOX FACTORY - DAY \nMr. Brooks is standing behind his desk staring blankly at the contents of his briefcase when Sunday, his Secretary, comes in. \nSUNDAY Yes, Mr. Brooks? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMr. Brooks doesn't immediately answer her, he's lost in thought. \nMARSHALL (from the couch) Before you open your mouth, be very sure this is the right thing to do. \nMR. BROOKS I will never be sure. \nRemember; Sunday can neither see nor hear Marshall. \nMARSHALL You get pissed at me because I'm always the one arguing to go ahead and do murder. Not this time, Earl. This is your decision. \nMR. BROOKS I know it's wrong. In my heart I know it's wrong. \nMARSHALL Then don't do it. Go with Mr. Smith tonight and end that, then let the Police put Jane in jail. Hopefully that will save her and we can happily go on with our tortured lives. \nMR. BROOKS That's exactly what I want to do. That's exactly what I should do. The thing is, she's my daughter and I love her. \nMr. Brooks raises his head and looks at Sunday. \nMR. BROOKS I'm going home. Cancel everything for the rest of the day. I might be in tomorrow afternoon. I'll let you know about that. \nSUNDAY I'll take care of it. \nMR. BROOKS If you need me, need me, call my studio, that's where I'll be. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) MR. BROOKS (CONT'D) I probably won't pick up, just leave a message. \nSUNDAY I'll try not to bother you. \nThe door closes behind her. \nINT. CERAMICS STUDIO \u00d1 DAY \nWith a hidden lever, Mr. Brooks lowers casters under the kiln and rolls it aside to reveal a Combination Safe imbedded in the concrete floor. \nHe spins the dial, opens the Safe and extracts four quadruple- pocketed plastic sleeves which he lines up in front of himself. \nEach sleeve contains a Driver's License, two Credit cards and cash. \nThe pictures on the Driver's Licenses are of Mr. Brooks, but you wouldn't immediately recognize him because of the disguises. \nAs he's trying to decide which of the four Identities would be best for what he has in mind, Marshall comes forward to look over his shoulder. \nMARSHALL The thing that bothers me about this, besides the fact we're not prepared, and a multitude of other things, is what does Mr. Smith do when he's walking west tonight and you don't show up. That little freak could flip out. \nMr. Brooks chooses the first sleeve and the third sleeve. The other two go back into the Safe. \nMR. BROOKS I'll take care of it on the way to the airport. \nEXT. FIVE STORY GLASS BUILDING \u00d1 DAY \nIt's in an Industrial Park. \nMr. Smith exits one of the doors and continues on into the Parking Lot to a moderately expensive foreign car sitting in a space identified by a sign which reads: \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMr. Baffert. \nHe squeezes the 'disarm' button on his key chain. The car chirps twice and he opens the door. Bending his knees to get in, he stops. \nThere is a section of Newspaper wedged in the steering wheel. \nWhen his brain unlocks he straightens up and moving only the top of his body, makes a quick recon of the surrounding area and his back seat. \nNothing threatening seen, he eases into the seat. Slam! The door is closed and locked. \nINT. CAR \u00d1 DAY \nGingerly, Mr. Smith removes the Newspaper. It folds open. On the first page there are words circled in red. \nAs his eyes dart from one to the other we go in close on the words and hear Mr. Brooks say them as Mr. Smith finds them. \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) Not - able - to - meet - \nMr. Smith turns the page. \nMR. BROOKS (V.O.) - tonight - Do - it - same - \nTurns the page. \n", "test3_id": 2522}

DEBBIE What? 
PETE Shallow dance music. 
DEBBIE It's not! It's fun, and it's about release and sex and power. 
PETE You know, you don't have to like it. It's really not for you, that's fine. 
DEBBIE This is a job. This is not a hobby. Can't you love him just as a hobby? And sign a fifteen-year-old hot girl so we can eat? 
PETE Graham Parker and The Rumour had two albums in the Rolling Stone Top 500 Best Albums of All Time. Two of `em. If I can just sell ten thousand records to his hardcore fan base, we're golden. 
An ambulance drives by, sirens blaring. 
DEBBIE (pause, then laughing) The last of Graham Parker's fans just died. 
INT. SADIE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Pete and Debbie walk in mid-argument. Sadie is listening to a song on her iPhone. 
DEBBIE Sadie. Sadie, what are you listening to? (MORE) 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Okay, this is music that makes people happy. And this is what people buy. Right, girls? 
She puts Sadie's iPod in a dock and plays the Nikki Minaj rap "Roman's Revenge." They all start rapping along to it. 
They all laugh and dance and go crazy. Pete turns the iPod off. 
DEBBIE (CONT'D) Why did you take it off? 
PETE Now, something that really rocks. 
Pete puts on "Rooster" by Alice In Chains. 
PETE (CONT'D) This is called good music. From somebody's heart. 
SADIE This is bumming me out. This isn't fun. 
PETE Just listen to these words, okay? 
CHARLOTTE I don't understand the words. 
PETE This is lyrics, this is poetry. This is what is going to survive in a hundred years. 
DEBBIE It just doesn't make people happy. 
PETE It makes me happy. I can dance to it. 
Pete starts dancing around like it is fun. 
DEBBIE You're the only one in the room who's happy. 
Pete stops his music. 
PETE Sometimes, I wish just one of you had a dick. 
CHARLOTTE Well, we don't want one. 
INT. HOUSE - MORNING 
Pete sits with the kids and eats breakfast. Debbie scurries around him to prep the kids for school. 
DEBBIE (to Pete) Is there something that you can do to be helping me right now? 
PETE Yeah, I'm ready to help. Just tell me what to do. 
DEBBIE Can you go get a lunch box or something? 
PETE For me or for them? 
Charlotte runs away towards her room. Sadie screams. 
SADIE Charlotte! I've got a test! 
CHARLOTTE I'm coming! I'm coming! 
SADIE Charlotte, I'm going to kill you! 
Debbie covers Sadie's mouth. 
DEBBIE Shhh! 
EXT. SCHOOL PARKING LOT - MORNING 
Debbie drives the kids to school. 
EXT. SCHOOL - MORNING 
Debbie runs Charlotte into the school. Along the way they see a lot of parents. Debbie says "Hi" to them in the way that lets us know that she does not know anybody's name. Debbie says "Hello" to a PREGNANT FIFTY-YEAR-OLD PARENT, towing a seven-year-old boy. 
DEBBIE Hi, any day now, huh? 
PREGNANT FIFTY-YEAR-OLD PARENT Not really. Three more months! 
Another parent, BETH, and her adorable child walk over. 
BETH Katie's dying for a play date. Let's hook these two up. 
DEBBIE That would be great, I'll call you. 
Beth and Katie walk off. 
CHARLOTTE No. 
DEBBIE "No" what?

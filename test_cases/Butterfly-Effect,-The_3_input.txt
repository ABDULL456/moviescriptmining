Evan moans and tries to rub his temple with his stump. 
EVAN Where are we going? 
KAYLEIGH We have to get you to Sunnyvale. You're having one of your famous hemorrhages. 
EVAN Stop! Take me back! 
LENNY Sorry, tough guy, no can do. Your mother would kill me. 
Evan launches his body forward and spills clumsily out of the wheelchair. Lenny must halt in order not to crush Evan. As Evan writhes about on the floor, his legs paralyzed, a CROWD GATHERS. 
Evan focuses on Lenny, but it's hard to ignore the crowd that titters and snickers in the background. 
EVAN Take me back, Lenny! (teeth clenched) You owe me that much. 
Kayleigh turns to face the jeering crowd. 
KAYLEIGH What are you geeks looking at? Must be nice to be so goddamned perfect, huh? Fucking losers. 
The crowd breaks up and leaves. 
EXT. COLLEGE QUAD - DAY 
It's calm now. Lenny and Kayleigh push Evan's wheelchair around the quad. Evan now wears prosthetic arms. Random PEOPLE call out to Lenny. He's extremely popular in this world. 
LENNY 'Sup, Sheila! We missed you at the party! Don't even think I'm giving you my lab notes either! Think I like getting up for "eight thirty's"? 
Lenny pushes Evan past Thumper and Cricket. Their conversation stops and they stare at their feet as Evan gets wheeled by. Evan boils to be treated as if he were non-existent. 
LENNY Hey, there's Tommy. 
Evan spins around in fear. He sees Tommy, clean-cut, and handing out flyers in front of a banner that reads "Campus Crusade for Christ." Tommy seems good-natured now, working hard and soliciting names for his list. He looks up as Evan rolls along and his eyes brighten to see Evan. 
TOMMY I did what you said, man! We're pooling our student funds with Hillel House and we're going to have an Awareness Dance. 
EVAN Oh goody, nothing like spinning my chair around to a techno mix of Hava Nagila til I puke. 
Tommy frowns and exchanges glances with Lenny, who shrugs and nods back to him. 
LENNY Uh, we should be getting to class now. 
EVAN Forget it. What's the point of Psych now? Tomorrow I could wake up as some dirt farmer in Bangladesh. 
Another exchanged glance. Kayleigh looks at Evan. 
KAYLEIGH Let's go for a stroll. 
Evan allows Kayleigh to roll him away from the others. To the very spot where Evan once killed Tommy. 
Evan stares at his prosthetic hand which he can "magically" will to open, close, open, close... 
EVAN So Tommy's really into this Jesus kick, huh? 
Kayleigh looks at him curiously. 
KAYLEIGH You know how spiritual he's gotten ever since he saved Mrs. Halpern and Katie. 
EVAN He saved Mrs. Halpern? Please, the twisted fuck. 
Kayleigh, now by a bench. Stops and sits. As she casually uses her foot to turn his chair to face her, she pulls out a granola bar and hands it to him. 
His prosthetic hand crushes it. It crumbles to dust. She seems more confused. 
KAYLEIGH Is something the matter? 
EVAN (re: prosthetic arms) Yeah, I think I gotta get these fixed or something. 
She leans into him, gently feeding him her remaining bar. 
EVAN Kayleigh? Do you ever think about "us?" I mean, wonder if it could ever have been different between the two of us? 
KAYLEIGH Sure, Evan, why not? You were the first person I really ever cared about. 
EVAN I was? 
KAYLEIGH That's why when I was little I never went to live with my mother. 
EVAN I don't get it. 
KAYLEIGH (feeding another bite) When my folks split, they gave me and Tommy a choice who we wanted to live with. I couldn't stand my dad, but I knew if I moved to my mom's I'd never see you again. 
EVAN I never knew that. So then you still sometimes think of us... together? 
KAYLEIGH It's crossed my mind from time to time. 
EVAN (hopeful) And...?

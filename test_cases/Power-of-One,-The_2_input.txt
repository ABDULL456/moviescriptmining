GEEL PIET Not possible. The kommandant never allow the people to have such a thing. 
DOC He'll think it's a concert for him and the brass. But we'll know, ay? And the people will know. 
PK He'll never let black be with white here, Doc. 
DOC If the black is part of the 
orchestra, like the piano, he will. 
GEEL PIET But the people have no instruments in this place, big baas. 
DOC They have their voices. Each tribe a different voice, a different language -- all singing together. It is brilliant, no? 
PK Except the tribes don't trust each other. They don't even talk to each other. 
DOC (crestfallen) Oh. This is correct.    This stupid hatred. 
GEEL PIET They will do it for you, kleine baas. You are Onoshobishobi Ingelosi. You bring the tobacco. You write the letters. You put clothes on their children's bodies and food in their bellies. All you do is ask and they all sing for you. 
DOC He's right. Wunderbar.    You are the smartest of us all. Geel Piet smiles as he lifts the watering pot to exit.   A truncheon stops him. All turn to Sergeant Bormann. 
BORMANN A kaffir smarter than all of us? You are a strange German, Professor. 
DOC That little maniac with the moustache in Berlin you admire. He is the strange German. And soon kaput, I hope. 
BORMANN If that's true you'll not be long for this place, eh, Professor? 
DOC No, Sergeant.    God willing. 
BORMANN And you, too, little Rooinek.     But you, kaffir, Hitler comes or goes... 
He takes Geel Piet's hand. 
BORMANN You are going to stay with me. 
He forces Geel Piet's hand closer and closer to a cactus with long thorns. 
BORMANN And I will find out all your secrets once your friends are gone. One slip... 
He pushes Geel Piet's hands onto the cactus needle.        Geel Piet does not cry out. BORMANN I have you. 
He lets go of Geel Piet's hand.     Geel Piet removes it from the cactus, bloodied. 
BORMANN Get out of here. 
Geel Piet takes his watering can and goes. 
BORMANN You see, Professor, they are not like us. A white man would scream bloody murder. 
Doc and PK glare at Bormann.    He smirks and walks away. PK (V.O.) As the weeks went by and the date for the concert grew closer, my life was a whirlwind. PK and Geel Piet appear before various tribal leaders, talking, agreeing, shaking hands. 
PK (V.O.) Having obtained the cooperation of all the tribal groups, we set about instructing them. Four men from each tribe were taught the 
intricacies of their group's parts. They were the choral leaders responsible for teaching the others. 
PK and Doc instruct. Doc plays the piano. PK leads the singers. Geel Piet turns the pages for Doc. 
PK (V.O.) At night the prison hummed with the men in their cells practicing. 
CUT TO: 
83   EXT. PRISON TOWER                                         83 
Nervous guards patrol as the SOUNDS of the prisoners singing wafts through the air. 
CUT TO: 
84   INT. BOXING ROOM                                               84 
Geel Piet instructs PK. 
P.K. (V.O.) My boxing instruction accelerated as well. It was as if Geel Piet was trying to give me every bit of boxing knowledge he had before we parted. And always from the corners and shadows Bormann watched and waited. Bormann watches PK and Geel Piet from the door of his room, his truncheon beating idly against his leg. 
CUT TO: 
85   INT. RING                                                      85 
A photographer sets up a group picture of the boxing squad -- kids and guards. Geel Piet stands off to one side, OUT OF FRAME. 
PK (V.O.) Our boxing squad, the Barberton Blues, won the State Championship with a perfect record. I won at 100 lbs. It was my first championship. It made me want 
more. 
The group disperses. PK beckons the photographer to wait. He grabs Geel Piet and forces him to stand, much to the little man's protestations, for a photo of the two of them. As the picture is taken Geel Piet has the widest smile imaginable. 
86   INT. PRISON YARD - NIGHT                              86 The guards, all in crisp uniforms, patrol nervously, truncheons at the ready. The towers bristle with guns as hundreds of black prisoners file into the yard. 
PK (V.O.) Finally the night of the concert arrived. The prison atmosphere, normally tense, was keening. Each prisoner entering the yard is searched. It was prison policy to keep tribal rivalries boiling. Divide and conquer. The policy of control. 
PK (V.O.) (CONT'D) This was to be the first time in the history of the South African prison system that the tribes were allowed to mingle. And if trouble came, it would be the last. 
All the prisoners are seated on the ground behind Doc, who is raised with the piano on a small stage. Guards surround the prisoners -- a solid, edgy border encasing a black center. The front of the yard is filled with seats on which sit the Kommandant, his wife, assorted prison brass, politicians, and a smattering of the local Afrikaan Hierarchy. PK is overseeing the seating of the prisoners when Doc comes up to him. DOC Have you seen my page turner?

HELLBOY Liz and I- we had a fight- 
ABE 
OH- Hellboy eyes the CD player. 
HELLBOY Did I hear Barry Manilow just now? 
ABE (smiles hypocritical) Barry M- oh, Gosh- no- no- (fast, stammering) It was er- urm- Vivaldi. Il cimento dell'armonia I believe I particularly admire the passage... Hellboy hits the eject button on Abe's CD player. The music stops and he pulls out a different CD from the changer. 
HELLBOY What's happening to you?? 
ABE Ooh- Ooh- 
(SIGHS) All my life I thought I was alone, a made- up name and a random pasted on a cylinder. But then I saw her- She's like me. A creature from another world... Alone... Brother Red- I think I'm in love. 
HELLBOY You say that like it's a good thing. (looks at the CD) What track? 
ABE 
(ASHAMED) Track eight- 
HELLBOY 
(READS) Oh, God- you're disgusting- 
ABE I know- 
HELLBOY 2 74 
HELLBOY "Can't smile without you" 
ABE I'd cry, but I don't have the glands for it.. 
(DESPERATE) What am I going to do, Red???? Hellboy sighs and pops a beer, presses play and sighs heavily, looks around- 
ABE I miss him- Father- don't you?? 
HELLBOY 
(NODS) Everyday. 
ABE He would tell what to do- He would tell what's right- what's wrong- 
HELLBOY He did that for all of us... The opening strings of "Can't Smile Without You." 
ABE (sips beer) You know? I- I never much appreciated Manilow's artistry that much- until now- Now it seems to be a grand poet and speaks directly to my innermost feelings. 
HELLBOY Jeez- You need to get out more- The two of them sit there, growing quiet, listening to the syrupy music. Then, slowly, the two of them start singing: low at first and then at the top of their voices, moved and teary-eyed. 
110 INT. PRINCESS ROOM AT BPRD - NIGHT 
The Princess hears the distant music and smiles, but then feels a chill down her spine. She shudders and moves to the panoramic window and gazes outside, to the woods and the distant city lights below... 
HELLBOY 2 75 
EXT. BPRD - NIGHT 111 
The music can be heard at a distance. A dark figure stands on a hill, amid the trees, listening and watching... CAMERA MOVES IN: the Prince gazes at the building. 
CUT TO: 
112 INT. BPRD CORRIDOR - DAY 
Manning strides down the corridor, followed by the BPRD team. All of them dressed in BLACK LEATHER OUTFITS.

THE KING 
With the crack of a whip and the clatter of hooves, the royal coach pulls up to the shore of the lake. A door creaks open and King Casiodorus totters out. His face is puffy, his eyes are red. He slogs through the mud to the head of the dragon and commences hacking at it with a ceremonial sword. Horsrik steps out of the coach and draws himself up. 
HORSRIK (loud) All hail Casiodorus Rex -- Dragon slayer! 
The workers pause long enough to listen to this pronouncement and cast a glance at the sorry spectacle. Wordlessly they resume their labors. 
HORSRIK (nodding) Hail and praise be! 
DISSOLVE: 
ON THE ROAD - DAY 
The trail leads through copses and open meadows. Side by side, Galen and Valerian march up a long slope under a hot sun. He limps a bit; she finds a staff and hands it to him. 
VALERIAN You want to rest? 
GALEN No. I'm fine. 
VALERIAN You miss Ulricn. 
GALEN Yes. 
VALERIAN And the amulet. 
GALEN That too. 
VALERIAN Not me. I'm glad it's gone. I'm glad you did what you did. (he doesn't reply) You may not be a sorcerer, Galen, but I love you anyway. I don't regret anything that happened. I just wish -- 
GALEN Yes? 
VALERIAN (sighs) -- that we had a horse. 
Galen falls a step behind. He briefly closes his eyes and mutters something. They walk on a few paces. Then there is a whinny from the nearby woods and a white stallion canters forth. It crosses a meadow, comes right up to Valerian and nuzzles her. 
VALERIAN What is this? 
GALEN A horse. 
VALERIAN Did you...!? 
GALEN No. It must have been wandering loose. Or wild. 
Galen climbs aboard. He reaches out to help her up. 
VALERIAN Wait a minute. I just wished for a horse and here it is. 
GALEN You don't want to wish it gone, do you? 
She thinks for a moment, then lets him help her up. Galen touches the horse's flanks with his heels and they ride off. 
FADE OUT: 
THE END

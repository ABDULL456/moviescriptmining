RAY (embarrassed) It's the receptionist at one of the places I service video equipment -- she's very pretty and, you know, she never even talks to me and then today I come in and she's all "I saw you on TV the other night... You were so great ... " Next thing I know we're ... 
ED Next thing you know! Why didn't you stop? 
RAY Stop? I'm a guy. I don't stop. The woman's supposed to stop. We're the gas, they're the brakes. 
WOMAN (O.C.) (calls out) Ray, I finished the Snapple. 
RAY Fine! 
WOMAN (O.C.) Is there more? 
RAY In the cabinet, but it's warm. There's ice in the tray. I (to Ed) Talk to her. 
ED I don't even know her. All I know is she likes Snapple. 
RAY No, not her. Shari. Go over there and talk to her 
65    INT. CYNTHIA'S BEDROOM 
CYNTHIA Yes! Go! 
She THROWS SOMETHING at the screen. 
She PICKS UP the PHONE. 
66    INT. HALLWAY 
ED Why me? 
RAY You brought the cameras here! 
ED You brought the girl! 
RAY Please! 
ED If I go over to Shari, the camera's going there, too. 
The Camera Operators are vigorously nodding and mouthing "Yes, Go." Ray is oblivious to this, but Ed picks it up. 
RAY That's good. She'11 -- you know control herself. Look. If I go over there, she's just gonna slam the door on me. Just go over and beg her to talk to me, that's all. Please. You owe me for this! 
Ed accepts the irony of Ray's attitude without comment 
67    INT. ANOTHER HALLWAY- NIGHT The door opens, revealing RITA, Shari's roommate. 
RITA (nervously) Um... Shari knew you were coming over because she saw ... 
ED Right, yeah -- 
RITA (apologetic) She really doesn't want you and the camera in here right now. 
ED No, I understand. That's - where is she, is she all right? 
Rita isn't sure how much she should reveal. 
RITA I ... gave her a drink. I thought it ... but she's not much of a drinker, so it's made her a little... belligerent. 
Shari appears in the doorway over Rita's shoulder. she's holding a liquor bottle and she's a little drunk. 
SHARI What do you want?! 
ED (awkward) Shari, I'm just really sorry. Look, I know this is... unbelievably awkward, but if I could come in for like a second and -- you know -- just say... two words, then... 
Shari indicates with her head, that Ed can come in. 
Ed and Carlos enter. Rita shuts the door. Shari crosses to a couch. Ed indicates for Carlos to give them some distance. 
68    INT. CONTROL TRUCK 
DIRECTOR Don't lose them, Carlos. This is gold. Stay out of their way, but get everything. 
69    INT. SHARI'S APARTMENT Carlos settles across the room. He rests the camera down as if he's not even shooting, but he's still guiding it where he wants it throughout the scene. 
RITA I'm gonna go to bed. (to Shari) You okay? 
Shari shrugs. 
RITA (CONT'D) Good night. 
She gives the camera a quick glance. 
RITA (CONT'D) (quickly, with a small wave) Hi, Mom. (she exits) 
ED Shari, Ray feels -- 
SHARI (starting to cry) Don't defend that horse's ass to me. 
ED I'm not. I'm not. I'm just Look -- you know, in a way, it's good. He got this out of his system now and he knows it's not worth it and, you know, someday if you guys got married or something -- 
SHARI Ha!

After a moment -- WOMAN'S VOICE I don't know. -- and the sound of a door closing. A small twisted hand lifts a slat of the Venetian blinds revealing the snow-patched street below.

EXT. BAINBRIDGE -HOSPITAL - THE.

LOBBY - BAINBRIDGE - DAY                               6B. A dim, sleepy cavern of a lobby. No one but a switchboard operator thumbing through a magazine. Echoing footsteps reach her station and she glances up and at the man from outside. i OPERATOR Yes? \n7.    INT. ADMINISTRATION OFFICE - BAINBRIDGE - DAY He seems uncomfortable. Perhaps it's the suit. Or the place. Or the situation. Or the hard straight-backed chair he's in. When he does finally speak, it's with great sincerity -- SAYER When you say people ... you mean living people,                 . Behind an old oak desk, the hospital's Director glances over to its Chief of Medicine, Dr. Kaufman, with a look that seems to wonder, As opposed to what? DIRECTOR Living people, yes.

He tries to clear up the confusion - SAYER I ' m here for the research                                 * position . . . in your neurology                            * lab. DIRECTOR Neurology lab?

Instead of shaking it - SULLIVAN Well, come on, Anthony, get him a coat for Christ's sake. - Sullivan thrusts his clipboard into Sayer's hand. 9.

Screaming louder at the sight of it, she tries to protect her face with her hands like a boxer being beaten senseless. \nv 11.   INT. DAYROOM (B) - DAY                                  11. A man in his sixties confronts Sayer with an announcement in a loud commanding voice - MALE PATIENT 1 X was born in I911f in Kinasbridae, New York. I came here in July of 1955. Prior to July of 1955. I resided a\u00a3 the Brooklyn Psychiatric Centerf Brooklyn. New York. Prior to thatP I was a person. And you. sir.- i Who the* hell >are.*v.ou?       . \n12.   INT. DAYROOM (C) - DAY                                     12. Stepping around a wheelchair, Sayer finds in it an elderly woman, nicely dressed, her hair done-up, a ribbon in it. Glancing at the chart in his hand - SAYER Mrs. Cohen? MRS. COHEN He\u00b7s here? She smiles, glances around. Sayer hesitates, uncertain who she means. SAYER I 'm here. (pause) To examine you. MRS. COHEN Oh, no, I ' m leaving today. My son's coming to take me home. \n(6   Confused, Sayer tries to find a discharge form among the papers on the clipboard. Unsuccessful, he excuses himself from her and crosses the room to a nurse. SAYER Excuse me. Mrs. Cohen's son. He's coming today? NURSE 1 I wouldn't bet on it, he hasn't for twenty years. The nurse turns away. Sayer crosses slowly back to Mrs. Cohen, trying to find the words to tell her. He doesn't have to; his discomfort does it. Her hand slowly reaches up and pulls the ribbon from her hair. 13.    OMITTED                                    . v \nDR. KAUFMAN                                 .

KAUFMAN Miss Costello, you'll see that Dr. Saver's patients waiting out there are rescheduled for tomorrow? MISS COSTELLO Yes, sir. DR. KAUFMAN Good night. Sayer watches Kaufman leave. So does Miss Costello. Lucy, looking less like a woman than a Diane Arbus photograph of one, doesn't. \n18.   EXT. PARKING LOT - BAINBRIDGE - LATE AFTERNOON C'\\      Sayer climbs into his Toyota and, as he buckles his seat belt, -*\u00a9     recites in a mumble to himself -- SAYER One . . .                                                  .

He slams on the brakes. Miss Costello's face appears at the window. Recovering, Sayer rolls it down. SAYER What'd I forget? MISS COSTELLO I just wanted to say to you I preferred your explanation. ()   It's unclear whether he knows what she's referring to. r \nMISS COSTELLO And that I'll look after things for you until you've \"settled in.\" Good night, doctor. She leaves. He stares blankly out after her, then at his dashboard. To it eventually, quietly -- SAYER Thank you . . . He glances to his rear view mirror and can see her walking away toward her car. To the reflection -- SAYER Thank you very much. \n18A. EXT. SAMMY'S FISH GROTTO - ESTABLISH - NIGHT             18A. \n19.   INT. SAMMY'S GROTTO, CITY ISLAND, THE BRONX - NIGHT     19. Sayer at a table eating dinner alone. He should've brought along something to read. He glances at the little \"Catch of the Day\" notice on his table for the tenth time, then absently in at an eel in a fish tank, which seems to be peering back out at him. SIDNEY V.O. I am not mad ... not mad . . . \n20.   EXT. SCHOOLYARD & BAINBRIDGE HOSPITAL - DAY                 20. A tether ball dangling from a rope, resting against a pole. The chains of a swing. Pigeons scavenging scraps on the asphalt of the elementary school playground, deserted. SIDNEY V.O. I know the difference between what is real and what is not . . . Beyond a chain-link fence, across the field, on the roof of one of Bainbridge's brick buildings, peering down from the edge of it, coat over his smock, hat on his head, an elderly man. \n21.   INT.

ANOT HE R DAYRO OM ( B) - L ATE R - DAY                           2 5. \nAnother man rigid as stone (FRANK). This one peering up at a television set with a horizontal hold problem. Sayer drags a chair over, stands       on it, adjusts the set, corrects it, gets a picture . . .      but the man's \"attention\" slowly drifts away. Sayer \"read       justs\" it, gets the jumping horizontal lines again, and the       man's vacant eyes return. \n26.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY                                . 26. Another dayroom crowded with patients, one of which stands before a table, absolutely motionless, on thin bird-like legs. It is Lucy, the one who caught/the tennis ball. The movement of nurses and other patients only accentuates her stillness. Sayer considers her from all      angles as    one considers an abstract art piece that baff     les but in   trigues. Unlike the others, she's on her feet. A      nd unlike    the others, she seems, to Sayer, to have been headed      somewhere    before turning to stone again. He decides that her destination was the drinking fountain across the room. And that it's the table, like a barrier, that has arrested her progress. He moves the table. In what appears to be slow motion, she takes a tiny step. And another. And another before encountering and being \"blocked\" by an empty wheelchair. She stops. Sayer moves the wheelchair and all other obstacles out of her path. She continues and eventually makes it halfway to the fountain before mysteriously stopping again. Sayer studies the puzzle ... there are no longer any barriers in her way, but she's not moving. Defeated, he goes to the fountain himself, fills a paper cup, and takes it to her. Across the room, a man in a wheelchair, another \"ghost\" (LEONARD), stares through eyes which seem more dead than alive. \"At\" Sayer. \n27.   INT.

Wrapped in a robe, he plays a melody. fcuJ   All around him lay packing boxes, some empty, many not. The *^^    books are out at least - many of a medical nature, many others on nature itself,, botany, many first editions - two and three deep on shelves, on the floor, on tables, stacked on the couch - and chairs almost like figures of people.t \n35.

Glancing up from files strewn across the table, Sayer shares a discovery with the janitor - SAYER They all survived encephalitis years before they came here. In the 1920' s . He taps a finger at the files - the patients' medical histories prior to admission - forms listing childhood diseases and ailments. The janitor, having no idea of course what he means, retreats with his pail and mop, closing the door. 36A. EXT. MEDICAL LIBRARY, NEW YORK - ESTABLISH - DAY            36A. 37.   INT.

Sayer manipulating its levers and eventually finding what he's after, an article titled: ENCEPHALITIS LETHARGICA, TEN YEARS LATER. Accompanying the text are grainy black and white photographs taken in an old operating theatre. An anatomical skeleton, a doctor in a white coat, subjects-- men, women and children with haunting eyes. \nSayer waits for the old doctor to tell him the reasons, the data, to support the merciful truth. But he doesn't seem to possess it any more than Sayer does. Long silence before: OLD DOCTOR Because the alternative is unthinkable. \n40A. INT. DAYROOM (C) - DAY                     '                 40A. The hand of a stone-like woman catches the tennis ball while the rest of her remains absolutely still. Sayer gestures to Anthony, Okay, and the orderly wheels her out of the crowded room. \n4OB. INT. WARD 5 DAYROOM - DAY                   \u00b7                4OB The hand of an otherwise still-life man snaps to catch the ball.

SAYER Sorry.                                      . \n41.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - LATER - DAY Sayer has assembled them all, the fourteen or fifteen he has decided are post-encephalitics, and wanders among them like a naturalist in a garden of stone. He lifts an arm of one particularly remote male patient.   It remains suspended, doll-like. He tries to follow the trajectory of another's gaze.   It leads only to blank space. He considers another who appears \"deeply involved\" in some minute and curious activity with his twisted hands, a kind of tearing, shredding motion. .                       v Across the room, paying no attention to Sayer, are Sidney and Lolly. He's gently brushing her hair. Sayer manages a pen into the hand of another woman and she \"draws\" a kind a kind of circular shape that spirals in on itself until it reaches a \"vanishing point\" in the center. \n42.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - LATER - DAY                         42. The results of standard perception tests scotch-taped to a wall of the examination room. Sayer and Miss Costello, like visitors to a museum, consider each for a moment before moving onto the next. Printed in the left column of each are a circle, square, triangle and daisy. In the right are the post-encephalitics' failed \"attempts\" to copy them. \nREV. 10/13/83   p.26 Sayer keeps coming back to one in particular. Unlike the others which, if you use your imagination, vaguely correspond somewhat positionally to the pre-printed shapes, this one bears no resemblance. This patient has instead scrawled over the shapes, seemingly violently. Miss Costello joins Sayer and ponders it along with him. Eventually, as if to excuse it and its maker-- MISS COSTELLO It's different. SAYER Quite.   It's quite bad. Sayer keeps studying it. SAYER (more to himself) Did he fail to understand? Or was he unwilling to fail? He isn't really asking her to answer, which is fine with her since she doubts equally both hypotheses. SAYER Could he be saying, \"I can't draw a triangle, don't make me\"? (before she can respond:) Could it be willfully bad? She doesn't say it but it's clear she thinks Sayer is reading far too much into the \"badness\" of the patient's scrawl. To himself - SAYER Which one is this? He leans closer to see the typed name . . . \n50.   INT. EXAMINATION ROOM - DAY                                   50. Sayer alone in the examination room, tired, at its window staring blankly out. His perspective: The empty lot below littered with abandoned couches, refrigerators, rusting automobile carcasses. And beyond the lot, the elementary school playground. Laughing children on swings and slides. Jumping rope. Batting tether balls. Playing hopscotch. Moving slowly in on one of the hopscotch games. On a girl tossing a bean bag into a square. Jumping over it and into the next square. Turning and jumping back. Balancing on one foot. Retrieving the bean bag and tossing it down again. Into the next square of the tile pattern chalked on the asphalt. \n51.   INT. LEONARD'S DAYROOM - DAY                                  51. From above, patients in wheelchairs dot the black and white checkerboard linoleum-tile floor like chess pieces. The pattern is regular to a point but then breaks up -- is interrupted by an area of solid white, where a wall once stood -- before being restored. It forms a kind of narrow \"sea,\" the white area, on either side of which lies \"land.\" \nAt floor level Sayer and Miss Costello, on their hands and knees, are \"blacking in\" the missing tiles with shoe polish, \"bridging\" the gap between the two checkerboards. The retarded patients around them ignore them. The ward nurses pretend to. ' Completing the pattern Sayer glances across the room to Leonard.

Then crosses it. \nREV. 10/13/89   p.34 Sayer doesn't know whether to applaud or cry. He does neither, burying his emotions behind a professional mask instead, and watches as Lucy, \"delivered\" to the other side, free now, lets the regularity of the pattern guide her toward the fountain. She nears it. She is almost there. Then she is. there. But doesn't drink. Doesn't stop. She continues past it . . . To a window, the window bevond the drinking fountain which Sayer hadn't noticed before, had no reason to notice, had no need to notice, with a broken pane allowing a view to the outside. She stares out at the traffic below, in hopes no doubt of figuring out where she is. And Sayer's eyes, behind which exhilaration and horror rise up, shift from her to Miss Costello, and then to Leonard, in whose mask of a face Sayer thinks he sees a faint glimmer. These people are alive inside. \n52.   INT. DAYROOM (B) - DAY A soap opera on a portable black and white TV in a narrow passageway of a nurses' station. Beyond.it, beyond a glass partition, a crowded idle dayroom. Miss Costello crosses into and out of view and reappears moments later next to the TV. She switches it off and turns to face the three RNs who were watching it. In their defense -- V NURSE The patients have all been given their morning medication. MISS COSTELLO Good.

SAYER Can I see you walk the length of the room?                        * Leonard walks slowly across the room past the perception tests and notes and Polaroids cluttering the wall. Coming back, he pauses. He's looking at a picture of himself taped there. Sayer watches him slowly reach his hands to his face to feel his features.

Coming in -- i      SAYER Good morning. LEONARD Good morning.     . His speech is still rather flat, halting., SAYER Been waiting for me long? LEONARD Yes. \nHe hadn't intended as impudent a tone as that which came out. More calmly ~ SAYER Perhaps if they saw Mr. Lowe. KAUFMAN I think you overestimate the effect Mr. Lowe has on people. We're talking about money here. Kaufman sips at his coffee and slowly becomes aware   of the silence around them. No one is talking. He glances    up as Miss Costello walks by setting something on the table in   front of him. She leaves the cafeteria without a word. \nCD   Kaufman glances down. She has left a Bainbridge payroll check )\\cz> made out in her name. Kaufman turns it over. She has endorsed it back to Bainbridge Hospital.

She hands him a scribbled note. \"Less scientific\" it reads. \nSAYER Isolated circumstances -- the mention of his name, notes of particular pieces of music, the touch of another human being -- managed on occasion to briefly summon him, but these awakenings were rare and transient, lasting only a moment or two. Sayer glances to Miss Costello.   She nods, \"Good, that's better.\" SAYER The rest of the time he remained in a profoundly eventless place ~ deprived of all sense of history and happening and self -- encysted, cocooned, enveloped in this metaphorical if not physiological equivalent of sleep . . . or death. Tight on the screen, on Leonard, as he was. Looking more like a photograph of a man than a motion picture of one. SAYER This was his condition when first seen by me in a remote bay of this hospital. And the quality of his life for the last 30 years. The \"before picture\" of Leonard on the screen is replaced with the \"after\" -- his eyes alert, his hands exploring a desk microphone. He glances up and off at something. LEONARD (FILM) Now? SAYER'S VOICE Whenever you're ready. LEONARD (FILM) My name is Leonard Lowe. It has been explained to me that I have been away for . . . quite some time . . . He seems to withdraw, to wrestle with the thought, to try to somehow come to terms with it, to somehow resolve it. He nods as he finds within himself some source of strength and looks directly at the camera. LEONARD (FILM) I'm back. \n117.   INT. BOARD ROOM, LATER - NIGHT                            117 The lights are on, the screen rolled up, the board members and patrons visibly moved, almost shaken, and silent. Eventually one of the patrons, an old woman, reaches into her purse for her checkbook and a pen. Another patron, an elderly man, pulls a checkbook and pen from an inside jacket pocket. Another already has hers out in front of her ... Sayer and Miss Costello exchange a glance. The room is absolutely silent, except for the muted scratch of pens on paper. \n118.   INT.

JOE'S HABITAT - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT               51B \nThe CAMERA FINDS Gregg, leaning against the bar at the edge of the moat. His face is soft as he watches Joe. \nJoe lists his mammoth head and looks up towards the right corner of his habitat. Gregg follows Joe's eyeline and sees that Joe is looking at a TRANSFORMER. The ELECTRIC BUZZ reaches Gregg's ear... and he becomes aware of it in a new way. He hears its HUM the way Joe hears it -- strange, menacing. \nGregg shakes his head to himself -- why didn't the designers pay attention to this? He looks back at Joe, almost apologetically, and is startled to find that: \nJoe is looking back at him. \nIt is the first time these two have had real eye contact, and for Gregg it is almost overwhelming. Man and beast read each other's faces, and it is in this moment that the giant ape becomes more than a phenomenon to Gregg. Gregg finally feels some of what Jill has been feeling. He connects to Joe. \nAnd Joe connects to Gregg. It's just a blink of the eye, a turn of the head -- but it's there. And they both feel it. \n51C    OMITTED                                                        51C thru                                                                  thru \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \n55   EXT.

He collected his pay check. He's probably in some jungle by now, not using deodorant. \nCECILY I think he should be here. This is his discovery, after all. \nHARRY Excuse me, Gregg's expertise is pitching tents, not explaining primate behavior to the Chairman of the Conservancy Board. \nCECILY (disgusted) Know what I think, Harry? \nHARRY I have a feeling I'm gonna find out. \nCECILY I think you're jealous. \nHARRY (O.S.) Of Gregg? Don't be ridiculous. (beat) I'm crippled with envy. \nIn the distance, we see a Cadillac approaching on the Conservancy roadway. \nHARRY Just once I wanted to go into the field and find a new species... mollusk, anything.

Harry is      working for brownie points, excitedly pointing out his     \"important role\" in discovering Joe. \nHARRY I always had a suspicion that the legend coming out of the Pangani forest might have some truth to it. It was just a hunch -- sort of a gut feeling -- but I sent my field zoologist to check it out. \nCecily shoots a look at Harry. She's not going to let him grab the glory away from Gregg. \nCECILY That field zoologist, Dr. O'Hara, had a theory -- and Joe's blood work confirms it.

He's tamed his looks and dressed himself in modest attire. With his damaged hand concealed in his pocket and a pleasant smile arranged on his face, he has re-invented himself.

(pained) You see, I am here for Joe. And, in a way, for your mother, too. (passionate) I believe she would agree with me -- a magnificent wild animal like Joe needs more space -- like the Raha Preserve I run in Botswana. \nBingo.   Jill's face falls.    The guilt is working already. \nJILL Raha?   A preserve? \nSTRASSER I have twenty thousand acres there where the animals are free to run. I would like to offer them to Joe. (sighs) Here, it's such a shame... to see Joe living in a man-made habitat and being used as an attraction to raise money... \nStrasser shakes his head at the inhumanity of it all. His clever words work on Jill like a charm -- she looks absolutely crestfallen. He pretends to comfort her. \nSTRASSER Oh -- I've upset you! Please... I only mean to offer an alternative. I will be attending the event tomorrow night. Maybe we can talk more about this matter then. \nJILL I'll look forward to it. \nSTRASSER Good-bye. \nStrasser walks off, leaving Jill deep in thought.

Everyone is staring at me. \nGREGG (reassuring) They're not staring at you. (looks around) They're staring at that... uh... banana tower. \nJill turns and sees a ridiculous-looking decorative mountain of bananas sitting on a table top just behind her.

Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? \nStrasser puts his drink down, taps Garth. \nSTRASSER Let's go. \nThe two of them head for the exit. \nAT PODIUM - WITH BAKER \nBAKER When was the last time you laid eyes on something so unique, so spectacular, that it literally took your breath away? Well, prepare yourselves, for tonight you will have such an experience. \nWITH STRASSER AND GARTH \nHeading for the exit, they hear Baker's words and exchange a knowing glance -- if they have their way, tonight will be more of an \"experience\" than Baker is bargaining for. Garth slips his hand into his jacket, checking for the dog collar... \nJust as Jack and Vern start coming the other way. Jack's already had one glass too many, and he's reckless on his feet. \nJACK (to Vern) There's nothing in this punch, man.

A slight JANGLING sound, the TIMPANI of WIND CHIMES, floating through the air. It GROWS LOUDER. \nJoe stands up. The hair on his neck bristles. He moves towards the source of the sound, at the edge of the moat. \nJOE'S POV \nGarth stands at the railing surrounding the moat, rattling the dog collars. It's a sound that haunts him, from the darkest depths of his memory. He starts to GROWL and then he sees something that really drives him nuts. \nStrasser steps into the light, joining Garth by the water's edge. He rattles the dog collar, and now... \nZOOM IN ON JOE \nHis eyes, locking with Strasser's.

A couple million? \nSTRASSER I will get that for the paws alone. After we sell him off piece by piece, who knows how much we'll make? \nGarth shakes the dog collar more furiously, making Joe rush at them again. \nGARTH Got you going now! That should rattle the jewelry off the ladies. \nSTRASSER (indicating dog collar) Hang it there -- where he can see it. (warning) And come back for it -- after. \nGarth hangs the dog collar on the fence. Joe can hear it clank in the breeze -- he is in a truly frightening state. \nSTRASSER Come, we've done our job here. \n", "test2_id": 2791, "test3_input": "Just then, Vern and Jack drive up in a Blazer.

Jill hears JOE go THUD in the trailer. \nJILL Please!   Be careful... \nSTRASSER Always worrying, eh? Your mother was a worrier, too. Always worrying about the gorillas. It made her a lot of enemies. It led to tragedy. \nHis tone has something vaguely malevolent in it.    It rankles Jill. \nJILL My mother was brave. \nSTRASSER So are you, my dear. \nJill looks at Strasser sharply.

She sees herself crouching in the forest with Joe over 12 years ago, overhearing Strasser's curses, and her blood runs cold. She glances at Strasser, everything dawning on her at once. The hand... the face... it all comes together for Jill. \nStrasser catches the look on Jill's face and knows some- thing is wrong. Adrenaline is pumping through her. Unsure of how to make her next move, Jill tries to hide the realization that is crashing down on her... \nShe glances in the side view mirror of the truck and sees: \nGregg, driving up behind them in the Conservancy vehicle. Jill's face reacts ever so slightly, but Strasser catches it. He follows her eye line, looking where she looked, and as he also spots Gregg, Jill knows the game is up. She loses it and screams: \nJILL Murdering bastard! \nJill slams her elbow into Strasser's nose. Strasser's face reflexively goes down in his hands. Stunned, Garth swerves at the wheel. Fast as lightning, Jill grabs his hair and slams his face into the dash. \nBefore the men can recover, Jill kicks and claws her way over Strasser's back, fighting toward the open window... \n(CONTINUED) \n89    CONTINUED:    (2)                                              89 \nShe reaches through the window and grabs onto the side view mirror.

HOLLYWOOD BLVD. - WIDER SHOT - NIGHT                        98 \nThe picture postcard version.      Lots of neon.   Tourists. \nMovie theaters flashing elaborate marquees. \n(CONTINUED) \n98   CONTINUED:                                                 98 \nGleaming Harleys parked in a row. \nINTO FRAME -- trailer -- \n-- weaves wildly. It clips a car coming the other way and begins to skid sideways through traffic. It enters the intersection kicking off sparks, sending cars swerving away. \nWIDEN as the truck jackknifes -- and -- skids to a stop -- the back at an acute angle to the cab. A second of eerie silence as -- \nOut of the stores and theaters, people run towards the accident. They encircle the truck. People press closer trying to get a look. \nA loud GROWL stops them cold. \nTILT UP -- top of trailer. \n-- Joe's fist punches through. WIDEN as Joe tears away the top and pulls himself free -- climbing up atop the truck. Its effect on the crowd is like Pandora opening her box. They all surge backwards. \n(CONTINUED) \n98    CONTINUED:                                                          98 \nJOE'S POV \nLooking down at the horrified faces simply shouting at him. Confused by the blinding headlights and BLARING HORNS. People stampeded trying to get away -- some stumble on top of each other. \n99    LOW ANGLE - CAB                                                     99 \nGarth helps Strasser from the wreckage.       Neither of them are that badly hurt. \nSTRASSER Wait. \nStrasser reaches back into the truck cab.       Garth looks around, nervously. \nGARTH Police'll be here any minute. \nStrasser pulls a leather case from the truck. Then he reaches back in for his hunter's hat -- and sets it firmly on his head. We haven't seen Strasser like this since twelve years earlier: the hunter is back. \nThe sound of SIRENS reaches their ears.       Garth is nervous as hell. \nGARTH We better go. \nStrasser has the thousand yard stare.        Garth has to drag him away. \nGARTH Come on!   We need to get out of here! \nThe two of them leave the site of the accident, just as... \n100   EXT.

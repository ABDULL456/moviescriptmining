Cooper \nAugust 1997 Final Production Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \n1   EXT. MOUNTAIN RANGE - DAY                                    1 \nThe lush Pangani Mountains of Africa, mysterious and seemingly untouched. \n2   EXT. PANGANI FOREST - DAY                                    2 \nA warm golden light bathes the jungle. Shafts of sunlight filter through the forest floor. The sounds of WILD BIRDS break the hushed quiet of the setting. As we MOVE IN we FIND a large female mountain gorilla lounging, eating leaves in the dense undergrowth, her precocious baby gorilla plays nearby. \nTHROUGH CAMERA LENS \nA view of the mother gorilla, a few PICTURES SNAPPED. \nBACK TO SCENE \nThe photographer is RUTH YOUNG, naturalist, researcher, sitting in the undergrowth with her camera, notebooks, and sketch pad. Her precocious young daughter, JILL, plays nearby. \nJill smiles, watching the baby gorilla clown. As the baby sees her, he suddenly scampers to a nearby tree and hides his face behind it. Jill does the same. She peeks out to catch a glimpse, just as the baby peeks out to catch her eye. They both scamper to different trees. Each time they move to a different tree, they go through this peek-a-boo interaction, both moving further away from their mothers. The mother GORILLA notices, lets out a CRY. Ruth looks around for Jill and signals by a distinctive whistle for her to come back this instant. \nBoth children take a last look at each other and then scurry to their waiting mothers. \nRUTH Jill.   What did I tell you? \nJILL But Joe started it! \nRUTH It's not good for them to interact with us. (gathering her things) Besides, that wasn't Joe. It was Marley. \n(CONTINUED) \n2   CONTINUED:                                                   2 \nJill helps her mother heft the equipment as they start to head back to camp. \nJILL No it wasn't.    It was Joe. \nRUTH Joe is just a baby, Jill.      He was too big to be Joe. \nAs they walk, they can see the sunset over the mountain trail. \nJILL Check.   Check the pictures. \nRuth looks down at her daughter, surprised by the confidence in her voice. \n3   EXT. EQUATORIAL SKY - NIGHT                                  3 \nThe Southern Cross above the horizon. The Milky Way a dusty streak of white. A shooting star streaks in an arc down to the -- \nMOUNTAIN RANGE \nThe dark peaks silhouetted against the stellar glow. \nPOV SHOT \nCharging THROUGH dense, primeval forest. We hear an eerie metallic JANGLE of what sounds like wind chimes riding right with us. Something is moving quickly up this mountain. \n4   EXT. PANGANI JUNGLE - NIGHT                                  4 \nBursting THROUGH FRAME -- a pack of mongrel hunting dogs driven hard by a half dozen African men with rifles. \nPoachers wielding pangas (machetes). A glint of silver as a panga sweeps ACROSS FRAME, hacking at the wall of thistles and nettles. \nON DOGS \nEyes yellow. Teeth flared. The RINGING sound made by TIN SQUARES cut from cans, tied by rawhide around their necks. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. One poacher whips his panga again. (CONTINUED) \n4   CONTINUED:                                                     4 \nPUNCH IN to reveal -- impaled in the earth, a three-foot stick figure with a macabre animal skull for a head. The poacher shouts in local dialect until -- A foul-looking man, GARTH, pushes INTO FRAME. Carrying a heavy Weatherby Mark V rifle across his back. Garth yanks the primitive doll from the ground. Looks back as -- A figure approaches in the darkness. \nA glowing cigar clenched in his stained teeth, STRASSER checks the doll over -- primitive, grotesque; then snaps it in two. Tossing it away contemptuously, he shouts orders in the local dialect. \nThe men continue up the path. Dogs sweeping behind like a wildfire. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. PAN UP OVER TO -- \n5   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                            5 \nThe RING of the DOG COLLARS floats on a night breeze across a deep valley to the other side of the mountain, down to a... \nCLEARING \nA small circle of huts forming a campsite around a night fire. We go inside... \none of them -- \n6   INT. HUT - NIGHT                                               6 \nRuth Young's hut. On one side is a makeshift field laboratory, highlighted by a wall collage of photos -- family shots mixed right in with gorilla shots. \nRUTH \nsits on the edge of a cot, tucking Jill into bed.   She leans down, kisses Jill gently on her forehead. \nRUTH Jill, what made you think the gorilla we saw today was Joe? \nStrasser spins to see several gorillas, darting from the trees, a blur of black shapes trying to escape up the mountain. \nCLOSE ON ONE FEMALE \nThe same one Ruth watched earlier. Joe clings tightly to her back, his eyes wide with fear. \nJOE'S POV \nA nightmarish collage of images accompanied by the CLANGING of the dogs' COLLARS, the charge of the African poachers, the SCREAMS of the MOTHER and the other GORILLAS. Then he sees Strasser run forward, raise his rifle with icy precision. \nTHROUGH SCOPE \nStrasser has Joe's mother dead on. Her head in the cross-hairs as she tries to get away. The MOTHER'S raspy animal SCREAM is unmistakably maternal, heart-breaking. It ECHOES across the mountain as she tries to reach a deep stretch of woods. \nOn her back, Joe turns once more to look back and sees -- \nEXTREME CLOSEUP - STRASSER'S TRIGGER FINGER \nsqueezing gently, the EXPLOSION of the SHOT RATTLES the forest. \nThe MOTHER'S SCREAM is CUT OFF sharply. \nON JOE \nWe see Joe thrown THROUGH FRAME, tumbling into the high grass. \nThen, silence. \nSTRASSER AND GARTH \ncrash through the dense foliage to retrieve the body. The DOGS SNAPPING behind. CLANG-CLANG-CLANG. \n(CONTINUED) \n10   CONTINUED:    (2)                                           10 \nGARTH (shouting) Get the baby! \nSTRASSER (shouting) Don't shoot it! They want the babies alive!! Bring the sack! \nCLOSE ON JOE \nHe SCREAMS wildly, darts back and forth, desperately looking for his mother. \nJOE'S POV \nTHROUGH the tall grass in the b.g., he can see the Africans disappear up the hill hunting down the others. \nBACK TO SCENE \nAnd then we see Joe's anguish turn to fury. He GROWLS -- and as the two big hunters come nearer -- Joe springs out at them. \nJoe is moving so fast, Strasser barely has time to react before the furry black shape is on top of him -- WIDEN as Joe attacks Strasser, knocking him back. Strasser shouts and drops his rifle. Tries to pull Joe off as they tumble down through the trees. Strasser punches and pulls at this ball of sinew and muscle. He reaches for his Match Master side arm with his right hand. PUNCH IN CLOSE as Joe bites down viciously through the hand. Strasser howls... \nANGLE ON GARTH \nHe has retrieved his rifle and is charging hard for his downed companion. He looks for a clear shot at Joe. PAN RIGHT and RACK FOCUS as Ruth Young explodes from the trees and flashes past Strasser, snatching Joe away. Joe is not quite sure what has happened, but he hangs on to Ruth for dear life. \nStrasser staggers forward, holding his mangled hand. Enraged. \nHe rips Garth's gun away from him and with his bloodied hand, finds a way to pull the trigger. SHOTS RIP through BARK but Ruth disappears into the trees like a spirit. \n11   EXT. FOREST - ON JILL - NIGHT                                    11 \nRunning but nearing exhaustion. Hearing a fusillade of GUNSHOTS -- Jill runs faster, panic contorting her face. \nShe runs desperately, swiping at branches, stinging vines. \nANOTHER POV \nSomething is running TOWARDS her. \n12   EXT. FOREST - NIGHT                                              12 \nJill shines her flashlight into the forest. Further up, someone waves a light back and forth. Like a signal. \nJill's face lights up. She continues running. Suddenly, Jill is bowled over by Joe who leaps into her arms. They roll on the ground, Jill with the wind knocked out of her. They look into each other's face and both know that the worst is happening. They are both silent with fear. \nStrasser appears through the darkness. His right hand wrapped in a bloody swath. Denying the pain. Garth follows, gun up. \nJill and Joe lie hiding in the undergrowth. Jill's eyes tell Joe not to make a sound. They barely breathe. \nJILL'S POV \nof Strasser's and Garth's boots. Jill can hear the sound of their voices, but their words are indistinct. \nBACK TO SCENE \nSTRASSER (quietly) She's got to be here somewhere. She's got that damn devil with her. \nGARTH (matter-of-fact) I think you might've hit the woman. \nSTRASSER (shrugs) These people want to live like heroes, let them die like heroes. \n(CONTINUED) \n12   CONTINUED:                                                          12 \nThey are nearly on top of Jill and Joe, and their words are now crystal clear. Strasser looks at his bloody, wrapped hand and stares vindictively into the dark forest around him. \nSTRASSER That little demon took off my damn trigger finger. (in Roumanian) Monstrule! \nGARTH Your little 'monster' couldn't have gone far. Want to keep looking or...? \nSTRASSER (in pain) No.    Let's get out of here. \nJill and Joe lie still as stone as Strasser and Garth continue past. Once they're gone, Joe and Jill begin to breathe again. Then, Jill sees a light pop on in the darkness. She flashes back. \nJILL Mom! \nracing at breakneck speed over the dirt highway. Driven by GREGG O'HARA -- anyone would consider him young, strong and handsome -- except that right now, it's all hidden under the grime from a long flight and a week's growth of beard. Hair long, unkempt; clothes wrinkled. \nGregg passes four local men burning a clearing in the woods for yet more farmland. \nPushing its way up the mountain side. The humvee is packed with EQUIPMENT that RATTLES as Gregg hits every bump in the road. \n17    EXT. VILLAGE - DAY                                               17 \nA tiny African village, just a main square with a bar, a school, an infirmary and a gas station. \nStanding smack in the middle of the road is an East Indian with a goatee, wrap-around Black Flys, and a Nike workout suit. \nGregg's HUMVEE SKIDS to a sharp stop in front of him. \nGREGG You must be Pindi. \nPindi flashes him a broad smile. \nPINDI The one and only, bro. \nCUT TO: \n17A   EXT. VILLAGE - DAY                                               17A \nPindi is leading Gregg down a row of vehicles: two Land Rovers, one with a strange-looking seat attached to the front hood, and an old, flatbed lorry. A surly-looking group of men lounge around on them. \n(CONTINUED) \n17A   CONTINUED:                                                      17A \nPINDI Six men, three cars... everything you ask for, Mr. Ohara. (lowering his voice) All paid for in advance, out of Pindi's pocket... \nGregg holds an envelope filled with cash in Pindi's face. He nods towards the nasty-looking men. \nGREGG Sweet-looking bunch of guys. \nPindi snatches the envelope -- but Gregg holds onto his end. \nGREGG I asked for experienced trackers. \nPINDI These men are the best -- I assure you. Very best. \nGregg allows Pindi to pull the envelope away. He immediately rifles through the cash, checking to make sure it's all there. \nGregg eyes Pindi's men suspiciously, then walks around to the back of his humvee and flips open the storage boot, revealing an array of animal-tracking gadgetry. Pindi looks over his shoulder as Gregg loads a menacing-looking rifle. \nPINDI Nice piece you got there. What are we hunting, elephants? \nGREGG We're not hunting anything. \nPindi sees that Gregg is loading the rifle with tran- quilizer darts. This confuses him, but he pretends to approve. \nPINDI Ah! Tranquilizer darts. I agree -- much nicer to animals than bullets. \nGREGG (indicating tranquilizer gun) Your men know how to use this, right? \n(CONTINUED) \n17A   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                  17A \nPINDI Oh sure, boss.     Only professionals here. \nGregg carefully puts the rifle back, then grabs a pair of Minolta 10x20 binoculars. \nPINDI So tell me, boss -- where are we going today? \nON Gregg, panning across his field of vision with the binoculars. He stops. \nGREGG There. \nPOV THROUGH BINOCULARS \nThe highest peak in the range, playing hide and seek with the clouds. \nBACK TO SCENE \nPindi's men see where Gregg is pointing. They murmur, trading grim glances at each other. Pindi jumps with nerves. \nPINDI There? Uh, boss, that is not such a good mountain. The men don't like it very much at all. You see there is a legend they believe in, that a creature lives there... \nGregg's back to checking his equipment. \nGREGG 'N'Gai Zamu.' The sacred guardian of Mount Pangani. \nPindi looks at Gregg, surprised he knows this. \nPINDI You know it? How funny! (with dread) That's not, by any chance, what you are looking for, is it, boss? \nGregg looks from Pindi's nervous face to the serious faces of the trackers. They are all watching him. \n(CONTINUED) 14A. \n17A   CONTINUED:    (2A)                                              17A \nGREGG Looking for a legend?   No.   Why would I do that? \nGregg takes the car keys from Pindi's hand. \n(CONTINUED) \n17A   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             17A \nGREGG Gimme those. \nOFF Pindi -- not particularly thrilled... \nCUT TO: \n18    EXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY                                      18 \nA nearby Land Rover bounces two feet into the air from the impact. \nHis canines are fully exposed. Thick, black hair on his crest stand erect. Deep brown eyes aglow as he gives another DEAFENING CALL. This is JOE. Backlit by the sun he seems to encompass the forest. \nPUSH IN CLOSE ON Gregg's reaction.       In complete awe. \nGREGG Don't anybody move. \nPINDI (frightened out of his wits) How about... I move... just over here... \n(CONTINUED) \n22    CONTINUED:    (4)                                               22 \nPindi scurries for cover behind the frozen, awe- stricken trackers. \nANGLE - JOE \nmoves to the cage and peers inside. The LEOPARD paces and HISSES. Joe straightens up bi-pedally and pounds his massive chest with his fist. The hollow POK-POK-POK ECHOES off the mountain. \nJoe raises his hand again and smashes the top off the cage, as if it were made of matchsticks. The leopard leaps out of the cage and dashes safely into the forest. JOE bares his teeth and ROARS at Gregg, as if to say \"stay off my mountain.\" His mission accomplished, Joe quickly turns and starts back for tree cover. \nSilence. Everyone is open-mouthed, unable to believe what they have just seen... \nThen Greg snaps out of it. Bursting into action, he runs to the humvee, motions to Pindi. \nGREGG Come on!!   We're going after him! \nPINDI What is this 'we'? There is no way my men will ever agree to... \nGregg yells to the paralyzed trackers: \nGREGG (in Swahili) Three times your price. (in English) Triple your fee. \nThat's what it's all about. The men get a move on, running for the vehicles as fast as they can. \nENGINES REV, DOORS SLAM, as the trackers ready for the chase. All four cars pull out. \n22A   OMITTED                                                         22A \n23    EXT. MEADOW                                                     23 \nAll is silent for a moment, then Joe EXPLODES INTO FRAME. Joe hears the DRONE of ENGINES -- turns to see -- \n(CONTINUED) \n23   CONTINUED:                                                      23 \nJOE'S POV \nThe caravan, looking like the cavalry in a Western, comes charging over the hill. \nGregg's humvee comes crashing over a ridge in pursuit of Joe. Gregg yells out to the cars around him: \nGREGG Herd him towards me!   I gotta get close. \nGregg grabs his DNA stick and grins at Pindi. \nGREGG Real close. \nPindi realizes with a sickening feeling that Gregg is having a major rush. \nANOTHER ANGLE \nThe lead car, a Land Rover, comes right up behind Joe. \nBACK TO SCENE \nJoe -- sensing the car next to him, turns and ROARS... \nLAND ROVER \nThe guy with the tranquilizer RIFLE panics and FIRES! \nBACK ON JOE \nThe dart hits his arm.     Uh oh.   That was a mistake. \nINT. LAND ROVER \nThe tracker has just enough time to get a good look at Joe's furious expression before... WHAM! \nJoe throws his shoulder into the side of the Land Rover, sending it tumbling end over end into a ravine. \nON GREGG \nDisgusted with the guys' stupidity. \n(CONTINUED) \n23   CONTINUED:    (2)                                            23 \nGREGG Experienced trackers, my ass! \nPindi shrugs. The two of them watch as Joe continues running, then changes directions and starts heading straight for them. The humvee has to swerve out of the way to avoid colliding with Joe. \nFOLLOW JOE as he books across the meadow in the opposite direction, now. The modified Land Rover with the hot seat attached to the hood swerves around and chases Joe. They catch up, and the tracker climbs into the hot seat, readying a metal clamp attached to a chain... \nGREGG \ntries to yell across at him. \nGREGG No, we don't want to... \nToo late, the guy's slapped the clamp onto Joe's arm. \nJoe ROARS, tries to shake off the chain, then speeds up. \nTHE CHAIN \nThe green paradise of the mountain rushes right AT us. Bright blossoms and strange insects. The sun diffuses in daggers of light. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nEXT. PANGANI FOREST - BACK WITH GREGG - DAY \nGregg climbs over a fallen tree. Ducks under some low branches. Stops to catch his breath. He listens intently. Takes another step forward. Hears a TWIG SNAP. \nTHROUGH VIDEO CAMERA \nPAN RIGHT. Joe springs out from hiding -- as gorillas love to do to enemies. He charges Gregg and cuffs him onto his back. Joe is in full attack mode -- eyes wide, teeth exposed. He snatches Gregg by the foot. \nGREGG \nscreams as he's jerked helplessly into the air. Joe shakes Gregg viciously -- then whips him back and forth, knocking him against a sapling. Gregg fights to free himself but he's no match for Joe's strength. He knows Joe is going to hurt him badly -- maybe kill him. \nJoe cocks his arm -- to crush Gregg against a wide tree trunk. (CONTINUED) \n24   CONTINUED:                                                     24 \nJILL (O.S.) Joe!   Stop! \nJoe looks surprised, caught with his hand in the cookie jar. \nGREGG'S UPSIDE-DOWN POV \nA beautiful young woman is standing ten feet from him. \nBACK TO SCENE \nGREGG Oh, wow. \nJILL Joe... \nON Jill -- she looks at Gregg like he's the lowest form of life on earth. \nJILL ... drop him. \nAnd Joe does, dropping Gregg hard to the ground.   On his head. \nCUT TO BLACK. \n25   OMITTED                                                        25 \n26   INT. VILLAGE INFIRMARY - DAY                                   26 \nOVER BLACK, we hear the MURMUR of VOICES, speaking in Swahili. PICTURE FADES UP... \nPOV SHOT \nLOOKING UP AT KWELI, 12 years older than we last saw him. Kweli looks right INTO CAMERA, then says something over his shoulder in Swahili. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nBruised and bandaged, Gregg blinks, trying to bring his eyes into focus. \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:                                                    26 \nGREGG Where am I? \nKWELI The infirmary. You've been unconscious for an entire night. You're lucky to be alive. \nGregg winces as he slowly raises himself to his elbows. \nGREGG Strange, I don't feel lucky. \nHe takes in his surroundings; a simple infirmary. THROUGH the open door, he can see the village he started his trip in. \nKWELI You crashed your vehicle. It is waiting for you outside. \nGREGG You're an injury behind. The kicker was getting dropped on my head by N'gai Zamu. \nKweli chuckles. \nGREGG Think that's funny? You should try it? \nKWELI N'Gai Zamu is just a legend, my friend. \nGREGG No, he's a giant gorilla with a mean backhand. There was also a woman... \nGregg tries to get up.     It's an ordeal. \nKWELI A woman? \n(CONTINUED) \n26   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 26 \nGREGG Out in the jungle. She saved my life. A beautiful woman. \nKweli gives him a patronizing smile. \nKWELI You were dreaming, Mr. Ohara. \nGREGG No.    I never remember my dreams. \nGregg sits up in bed and swings his feet to the floor. Kweli turns and heads for the door. \nKWELI It would be wise for you to see a doctor in Kimjayo. I took the liberty of calling one for you. \nGREGG Don't need one. \nKWELI But he is expecting you. If you can drive, you should leave today. \nKweli walks out of the room. Gregg squints after him, sensing that something is up. \nCUT TO: \nBACK TO SCENE \nJill continues waving the flashlight, waiting for a response. Then, we hear the sound of SOMETHING LARGE APPROACHING. \nON GREGG \nThe thunderous sound making him nervous... \nON JILL \nNot so Jill. She waits calmly, at first, as the FOOT- STEPS APPROACH. Then, as the branches begin to bend and break, and we get our first glimpse of fur, she smiles. \nMighty Joe Young emerges from the brush, not growling, not threatening, but rather looking like a puppy coming to greet his master. \n(CONTINUED) \n31   CONTINUED:                                                       31 \nJILL (cooing to Joe) Hey, handsome. How are you? \nON GREGG \nAbsolutely thunderstruck, watching in awe as the giant GORILLA bows his head so Jill can scratch behind his ear. He makes LOW, GUTTURAL SOUNDS that are the gorilla equivalent of a purr. \nJill inspects Joe, checking him to see if he's okay.       Her voice is full of gentle concern and worry. \nJILL What were you thinking yesterday, letting those men see you? Don't do that again, okay? Please. (praying to herself) Please. \nWe see the fear in Jill's face, knowing that Joe can't understand what she's saying. She shakes it off and brightens. She gives Joe a playful tussle, then covers her eyes with her hands. \nJILL One.   Two.   Three. Four... \nIt takes only a moment for Joe to respond. His eyes open wide, he looks in every direction then, suddenly, crashes into the woods! \nJILL ... seven, eight, nine, ten. (yelling) Ready or not, here I come!! \nAnd Jill runs into the woods after Joe. \nCUT TO: \n32   EXT. PANGANI FOREST - DAY                                        32 \nJill walks through the forest, searching for Joe. It should be clear by now that they are playing hide and seek. \n(CONTINUED) 31A. \n32   CONTINUED:    (A1)                                          32 \nJILL (theatrically) Oh, my God! I can't find Joe. Where's Joe? \nShe stomps around, pretending not to see him. Of course, she knows exactly where he is. He's so big, the tree he's standing behind barely hides one leg. \nCLOSE ON JOE \nHe can't help peeking.    He loves this. \n(CONTINUED) \n32   CONTINUED:                                                    32 \nJill pokes her head around every tree. \nJILL Come out, come out... wherever you are! \nThen, pretending that she just spotted him, she charges right at him. \nJILL I found you! \nJOE ROARS, delighted by their game. Jill tussles with him, then gets a mischievous look in her eye. \nJILL Bye-bye, Joe! \nSuddenly, she dashes into the woods -- where she's actually small enough to hide well. Joe passes by her, moving through the foliage. \nIn a moment we see how much he fears actually losing her -- he begins to WHIMPER -- and spins around. He stands up to his full height, beats his chest and shakes his head in frustration. He can't bear the idea that she is gone. \nA beat, then Joe starts tearing bushes out by their roots, hunting for Jill. He sees one BUSH RUSTLING, goes over and rips it out of the ground, revealing... \nGREGG \nStanding there, completely exposed, filming all this with his dented video camera. He looks up at Joe towering over him. \nGREGG Oh boy. \nJOE ROARS! \nGregg stumbles backwards, trapping himself against a tree as Joe advances. Remembering what one should do when faced with an enraged gorilla. Gregg averts his eyes and rolls into a ball, assuming the submissive position. He's like a pill bug, playing dead, protecting the back of his neck with his arms. \nJoe raises his mighty fist -- it looks like he might smash Gregg anyway... but then he hears Jill's voice. \n(CONTINUED) \n32   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 32 \nJILL (O.S.) (soothing) Joe!   It's okay. \nJoe stops and turns his head to Jill. \nJILL Now get out of here, Joe.     Run. \nJoe looks at her, not sure why her tone's gotten so stern. \nJILL Run, Joe.   Run! \nJoe looks back at Gregg, still curled into a tight ball. He gives him a playful, parting swat for good measure before obeying Jill and running into the forest. \nThe \"little swat\" is powerful enough to send Gregg rolling like a croquet ball into a thicket of bushes. Painfully, he uncurls, plucking nettles out of his legs as Jill approaches. \nGREGG (pulling out a nettle) Nobody better try and tell me I imagined this. \nStrasser reaches out to pick up the photos, and as he does... \nCLOSE ON STRASSER'S HAND \nA black leather glove-like apparatus with a thumb and forefinger in place that gives the appearance of a whole, if menacing, hand. \nSTRASSER Poor thing. Yes, he will be much happier here on our preserve. Back to the wild. Free again. \nA door opens behind Anderson.       Garth sticks his head in the room. \nGARTH Phone for you.     Urgent. \nStrasser stands. \nSTRASSER Will you excuse me, Mr. Anderson? \nStrasser turns and follows Garth through the door, into... \nCUT TO: \n35A   INT. BACK ROOM (RAHA) - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      35A \n... a room that would give dear Mr. Anderson nightmares. A man in a white smock is packaging poached rhino horns into boxes. The boxes, labelled medical supplies, are being sent to addresses in China. \nOn another wall, in front of a bank of telephones, is a dry-erase board covered with animal names, and their respective prices. \nSTRASSER See what our friends in China will give us for a Bengal tiger, Garth. \nStrasser hands Garth the photo of the tiger. \nGARTH Looks like a big fellah. (excited, looking at photo) I'll set a new record with you. \nStrasser picks up one of the phones.   He idly plays with a rhino horn as he talks to Pindi. \nSTRASSER Strasser. \nPINDI (O.S.) It's about time already! You know how long I am waiting? A man can only carry so much change... \nSTRASSER (irritated) What do you want, Pindi? \nCUT TO: \n35B   EXT. VILLAGE - SUNSET                                          35B \nA small street of stores -- all covered in brightly- painted advertisements. Outside one store is a lone pay phone -- manned by Pindi. Pindi speaks furtively, so as not to be overheard. INTERCUT conversation. \n(CONTINUED) \n35B   CONTINUED:                                                      35B \nPINDI Not what I want, boss, what you want. How about a giant gorilla? \nSTRASSER Talk. \nPINDI Big as three men, two thousand pounds, at least. \nSTRASSER You've been drinking, haven't you? \nPINDI Swear to God, boss. Saw him with my own two eyes. \nSTRASSER Don't waste my time again. \nON PINDI \nThere is a CLICK on the LINE. \n(CONTINUED) \n35B   CONTINUED:                                                         35B \nPINDI Hello?   Boss... \nNow a DIAL TONE.      Pindi looks at the phone. \nPINDI I'll catch him and charge you double, madar chode. \nPindi smashes the phone down on its cradle. \nCUT TO: \n36    EXT. VILLAGE - MORNING                                             36 \nIn the center of the village, two trucks of rough-looking men are gassing up their vehicles. A third truck arrives from the other direction. \nIt's a POACHER we recognize, one of Pindi's men, accompanied by a half dozen others, all armed with rifles. \nANGLE ON JILL \nShe steps out in front of the Poacher's truck. The driver SLAMS on the BRAKES, stopping within an inch of striking her. Alarmed, the Poacher stands in his seat and screams at Jill. \nPOACHER Stupid girl! What do you think you're doing? \nJill calmly walks up to the Poacher's side of the vehicle. \nJILL I found this in the forest this morning. Thought maybe you dropped it and might want it back. \nWith that, Jill brazenly steps forward and throws a net over his head. It's a poacher's net. \nEnraged, the Poacher slowly pulls the net off his head. The other poachers find the scene hilarious. It infuriates Jill. \nJILL Poaching is illegal!   Get off this mountain! \n(CONTINUED) \n36    CONTINUED:                                                      36 \nThe Poacher and his driver exchange a significant look. Nodding to each other, they start to climb out of their truck, eyes glaring at Jill... \nKWELI (O.S.) Jill!   Jill Young! \nGREGG You're not a very trusting soul are you, Miss Young? \nJILL No, I'm not. \nGREGG (sarcastic) Tough, isn't it? Trying to measure me up -- decide if I'm a fraud... \nJILL ... or a fool. \nGregg smiles, half sour, half amused. \nGREGG Well, I'd like to know if you're a bona fide lunatic or just a mixed up monkey girl but -- but I guess we'll have to take our chances and figure it out as we go along. \nJill snorts.    Gregg looks her straight in the eye. \n(CONTINUED) 42B. \n38   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                     38 \nGREGG Come on, Jill. Trust it.      You'll be in charge of Joe. (extends hand) Let's shake on it. \nJILL I don't shake. That's not how we make pacts around here. \nGREGG (growing impatient) Alright, how do you make pacts around here? \nJILL You have to endure a bite from a Makiki spider. \nGREGG A what? \nJILL You'll have a high fever and hallucinations. You'll say things -- lots of things. We'll hear what's in your heart. Then, if your intentions prove true, the pact is made. \nGregg nods to himself, considering. \nGREGG A spider bite and hallucinations? \nJILL That's right. \nGREGG Then you'll trust me and let me have Joe? \nJILL That's right.    Well? \nGregg cocks his head. \nGREGG Well... I think... that's the biggest load of crap I've ever heard. \nJill smiles. She's satisfied.         This is the answer she was looking for. \n(CONTINUED) 42C. \n38   CONTINUED:    (4)                                               38 \nJILL Good. Maybe you're not a fool after all. \nGregg scoffs, realizing she was only testing him. Jill turns and starts walking away. Gregg calls after her. \nGREGG Get your things together. Fast. We're getting out of here as soon as we can. \nGregg watches her go, head held high like a queen. He chuckles to himself. It's hard not to appreciate this girl. \nGREGG (to himself) Makiki spider. \n39   EXT. MOUNTAIN TRAIL - MOVING - DAY                              39 \nJill bursts INTO FRAME -- racing at full stride, long hair flowing -- so reminiscent of that little girl we saw before -- a wild mixture of fluid grace and strength. The trees seem to fly apart behind her revealing Joe -- running with her. As if speed alone could make their enemies disappear. \n40   EXT. MEADOW - DAY                                               40 \nJill watches the clouds rush by the mountaintop. Joe stands next to her, looking out at the mountain valley where they've grown up together. \nWind sweeps down from the peak. The trees bow and bend gracefully. To Jill, the mountain has never seemed more beautiful. She looks at Joe -- magnificent against the natural tableau of his world. She looks at him, worry on her face about what is about to happen to him. \nHe looks at her trying to understand. \nJILL I don't know what else to do. \nCRANE UP so we can see Joe and Jill against the Edenic mountain vista. 42D. \n40A   EXT. WILDLIFE CONSERVANCY - MOUNTAIN TOP - MORNING           40A \nBacklit against a blue sky. PAN DOWN as the wind RUSTLES the TREES and a flock of small birds appear and disappear like a storm cloud. CONTINUE DOWN PAST a waterfall, as we COME TO a grassy field, then a moat, then, finally, a railing at the edge of an observation area. \n(CONTINUED) \n40A    CONTINUED:                                                         40A \nNOW REVEAL \nThat what we are looking at is not, in fact, the African landscape, but rather a fabricated habitat, encircled by a sprawling campus of stucco buildings. \nWorkers in matching uniforms with the \"CALIFORNIA ANIMAL CONSERVANCY\" logo on them, run back and forth, a hive of activity in anticipation of the new arrival. \nPULL IN ON two of them, walking and talking: DR. HARRY RUBEN, the Conservancy's Director and Chief Zoologist, and DR. CECILY BANKS, an African-American veterinarian with long braids stuffed under a baseball cap. \nHARRY This is crazy. All I said was, 'Bring back some blood samples.' So what does he bring back? A giant gorilla. \nCECILY Don't even pretend to be upset, Harry. \nHARRY You know how much it cost to convert the tiger habitat? Try half our operating budget. \nCECILY You'll be on the cover of National Geographic, Harry. \nHARRY Hey, I just said it was crazy.    I didn't say it wasn't worth it. \nThey continue walking, and we... \nCUT TO: \n41     OMITTED                                                            41 thru                                                                      thru \n45     EXT.

Gregg gets out first. \nHARRY I'm confused, O'Hara. You phone us to say you're bringing back a two thousand pound wild animal... \nGREGG Hello, Harry.     Cecily. \nCECILY (affectionate) Welcome back, baby. \nHARRY ... but security tells me you've requested no firehoses, no restraints of any kind... \nGREGG Let me introduce you to... \nHARRY How are we supposed to control the animal? With a giant, rolled-up... \nHarry trails off as Jill gets out of the car. \nHARRY ... newspaper? \nHarry wasn't prepared for somebody this young and beautiful. Neither was Cecily. They raise their eyebrows at Gregg. \nGREGG Jill Young, Dr. Harry Ruben -- he run the place -- and Dr. Cecily Banks, who makes sure he doesn't screw it up. \nCECILY (chuckles) Chief veterinarian. Hi. \nJill steps forward, shy and polite.        She extends her hand. \nJILL Hello. It's a privilege to meet you both. \n(CONTINUED) \n49   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             49 \nHarry is too flustered by Jill to say a word. He just manages a weird little smile and a sound that's not English. \nJust then, a BANG and a loud GROWL come out of the trailer. Harry and Cecily almost jump out of their skins. \nJILL Coming, Joe! Hold on! (to Harry) I think he'd like to come out now -- if you don't mind. \nHARRY (stammering, scared) Mind?    No, of course I don't mind. \nJill and Gregg look at each other, excited. This is the moment they've been waiting for. They grin at each other. \nGREGG Harry?   I think it's time you met Joe. \nThey start moving to the trailer... \nHARRY Hold it! \nHarry whirls around and waves over a pair of nerdy, grad- school-geek conservancy workers, JACK and VERN. They run eagerly forward to take orders. They gawk at Jill, each one instantly deciding she is the woman of their dreams. Harry barks at them, bringing them back to attention. \nHARRY Jack? Vern?    Get the sedatives ready. \nJILL (quickly) We won't need any of that. \nHARRY Miss Young, we know what we're doing here, and the best way to... \nGregg steps forward. \nGREGG Harry -- you and I made an agreement. The lady's in charge of Joe. \n50   EXT. BACK OF TRAILER                                            50 \nJack and Vern nervously raise the gate to the back of the trailer. The gate lays flat against a retractable plank that creates a bridge to the habitat. \nJOE GROWLS SOFTLY from inside. \nJACK Easy, big boy. \nVERN Don't forget who's gonna feed you. \nThey raise the gate completely.    Jill comes up behind them. \nJILL I'll take it from here. \nJack and Vern are only too happy to let Jill take over. \nJOE'S POV - FROM TRAILER DOOR \nHe can hear Jill but sees only her silhouette at first... and the lush greenery behind her. He GROWLS... \nThe entire staff, other than Gregg, takes one step back- ward. Harry whispers in his ear. \nHARRY You sure she knows what she's doing? \nGregg's watching Jill with quiet admiration. \nGREGG She knows. \nBACK BY TRAILER \nJill keeps coaxing Joe. \nJILL Come on, Joe.     Come on, big guy. \nSHADOW \npasses over the staff of the conservancy. A look of absolute wonderment on every face as Joe emerges from the trailer. Cecily nudges Harry, whose jaw is slack. Gregg sees this reaction, and beams. \n(CONTINUED) \n50   CONTINUED:                                                       50 \nBY TRAILER \nJoe takes a step forward. He looks out across the plat- form into the sanctuary -- taking in the familiar trees and flowers the staff has planted for him. \n50C    INT. JILL'S CONDO - NIGHT                                      50C \nJill leans on her elbows, staring out her recently-broken window, a lost look on her face. \n51     OMITTED                                                        51 \n51A    EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - THAT MOMENT                               51A \nThe CAMERA LEAVES Jill's window and FINDS Joe, sitting in his man-made grassy field, looking equally lost and lonely. He is unsure of what to do with himself, confused by his surroundings. \nPAN TO: \n51B    EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - ANOTHER ANGLE - THAT MOMENT               51B \nThe CAMERA FINDS Gregg, leaning against the bar at the edge of the moat. His face is soft as he watches Joe. \nJoe lists his mammoth head and looks up towards the right corner of his habitat. Gregg follows Joe's eyeline and sees that Joe is looking at a TRANSFORMER. The ELECTRIC BUZZ reaches Gregg's ear... and he becomes aware of it in a new way. He hears its HUM the way Joe hears it -- strange, menacing. \nGregg shakes his head to himself -- why didn't the designers pay attention to this? He looks back at Joe, almost apologetically, and is startled to find that: \nJoe is looking back at him. \nIt is the first time these two have had real eye contact, and for Gregg it is almost overwhelming. Man and beast read each other's faces, and it is in this moment that the giant ape becomes more than a phenomenon to Gregg. Gregg finally feels some of what Jill has been feeling. He connects to Joe. \nAnd Joe connects to Gregg. It's just a blink of the eye, a turn of the head -- but it's there. And they both feel it. \n51C    OMITTED                                                        51C thru                                                                  thru \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \n55   EXT.

He collected his pay check. He's probably in some jungle by now, not using deodorant. \nCECILY I think he should be here. This is his discovery, after all. \nHARRY Excuse me, Gregg's expertise is pitching tents, not explaining primate behavior to the Chairman of the Conservancy Board. \nCECILY (disgusted) Know what I think, Harry? \nHARRY I have a feeling I'm gonna find out. \nCECILY I think you're jealous. \nHARRY (O.S.) Of Gregg? Don't be ridiculous. (beat) I'm crippled with envy. \nIn the distance, we see a Cadillac approaching on the Conservancy roadway. \nHARRY Just once I wanted to go into the field and find a new species... mollusk, anything. Instead, he makes the zoological discovery of the century. \nCECILY And he still has a full head of hair. \n(CONTINUED) \n55   CONTINUED:                                                       55 \nHARRY That's not funny. \nCecily nods to the road. \nCECILY Heads up. \nThe Cadillac comes to a stop in front of them. A distinguished man in a business suit steps out. This is ELLIOT BAKER, the Chairman of the Board. \nHARRY Elliot.   Good to see you again. \nBAKER Harry.    Dr. Banks. \nHe claps his hands together. \nBAKER So?   Let's go see him. \nCECILY Right this way. \n56   INT. CONSERVANCY NEAR JOE'S HABITAT - DAY                        56 \nHarry and Cecily walk with     a conservative-looking man in his fifties, Elliot Baker,     the Chairman of the Board of the conservancy. Harry is      working for brownie points, excitedly pointing out his     \"important role\" in discovering Joe. \nHARRY I always had a suspicion that the legend coming out of the Pangani forest might have some truth to it. It was just a hunch -- sort of a gut feeling -- but I sent my field zoologist to check it out. \nCecily shoots a look at Harry. She's not going to let him grab the glory away from Gregg. \nCECILY That field zoologist, Dr. O'Hara, had a theory -- and Joe's blood work confirms it. The gorillas in the Pangani carry a recessive gene that pops up every four or five generations with this rare form of gigantism. \n(CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED:                                                         56 \nBAKER (excited) And that's where the legend comes from! That zoologist of yours -- what's his name, Harry? \nHARRY (begrudging) Gregg O'Hara. \nBAKER Pretty damn sharp. \nThis kills Harry. Cecily snickers.      They arrive at the fence surrounding Joe's habitat. \nHARRY Here we are. \nThey walk up to the observation railing.        Baker cranes his neck. Joe's nowhere to be seen. \nBAKER Where is he? \nHARRY (calling) Joe! Here, Joe! (apologetic joke to Baker) I told him the Chairman of the Board was coming and he promised to come say 'hi.' \n61   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       61 \nAn exhausted Harry catches his breath at the gate around the habitat. Baker has a thoughtful look on his face. \nBAKER Put that girl in charge of the gorilla, Harry. \nHARRY What? Elliot, she's got no scientific... \nBAKER That ape is the best fund-raising tool this conservancy has ever seen. He's happy -- I'm happy. Put her on the payroll. \nBaker turns and walks away. \n62   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                       62 \nGregg and Cecily watch as Jill plays hide and seek with Joe. \nJill dashes away and runs over to Gregg. She is absolutely glowing, bouncing around with happiness.   She grabs both his arms, jumping up and down. \nJILL He's playing!    Did you see? \nGREGG (laughing) I saw. \nJILL He likes it here! Isn't it great? \nGREGG It's great. \nJill surprises Gregg by giving him a hug. Gregg looks over her shoulder and sees that Joe is giving him the evil eye. He's jealous. Gregg stares back, equally challenging. \nJill, unaware of the competition, lets go of Gregg and happily runs back to Joe. Gregg and Joe continue to hold each other's eyes. Cecily sighs and shakes her head. \nCECILY Sorry, babe, but in a pissing match the monkey kicks your ass. \n(CONTINUED) \n62   CONTINUED:                                                       62 \nGREGG What are you talking about? \nCECILY Oh please. I was wondering why you hadn't taken off yet. Normally, you're out the door soon as the animal's in his habitat. \nGREGG You've got an active imagination, Cecily. \nCECILY I don't think so. I think Mr. World Traveller has goo-goo eyes for the gorilla girl. \nGregg scoffs. But from the look on his face, it's clear she's hit a nerve. \n63   INT. JILL'S APARTMENT - DAY                                      63 \nA KNOCK at Jill's apartment door. She opens it and lights up to see Gregg standing there. Gregg looks past her into the room. She's made some changes; the bed's on the floor and a few large potted ferns crowd the room. \nGREGG Like what you've done with the place. \nJILL Too bad it's always so cold -- somebody broke my window. \nShe smiles at him and motions for him to come in.     Gregg steps just inside the door and stops. \nGREGG I just came by to tell you that I think Joe looks real good out there... \nJILL I know! This is working out -- better than I expected. \nGREGG ... and that I'm hitting the road. \nJill looks at Gregg keenly.    He's acting like he's got something to tell her. \n(CONTINUED) \n63   CONTINUED:                                                    63 \nJILL Where you going? \nGREGG Back to Africa. (pauses) For a couple of months. \nJill stays light. \nJILL No kidding?   When do you leave? \nGREGG Now. \nJill just nods. \nGregg is struggling -- this is more difficult than it's ever been for him. He tries to be nonchalant... \nGREGG It's the job, y'know. Always on the road. It's what I like, anyway -- can't stand to be caged up... \nThey meet eyes.      They both know what that means. \nGREGG You and Joe will be okay... \nJill shrugs, acting like she doesn't care either. \nJILL Oh -- of course. \nGREGG Yeah.   Well... \nJILL                         GREGG (overlapping)                    (overlapping) See you when you get back.           I'll call you. 63A. \n63A   INT. CONSERVANCY CONDO - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS ACTION             63A \nGregg turns and heads back down the hall.    Jill sticks her head out and calls after him. \nJILL (biting) Say hello to Africa for me. \nShe slams the door to her apartment. Gregg freezes for a moment, then continues down the hallway alone. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \n64    EXT. OUTSIDE JOE'S HABITAT - DAY                                 64 \nJILL Harry -- see what's in that cart? That's all we have left of the lobelia leaves for Joe. Did you by any chance place that new order I asked for? \nHARRY (guilty) Of course I... actually, perhaps I... \nJILL (sympathetic) I wouldn't be surprised if you forgot, considering you have so much on your mind. \n(CONTINUED) \n68A   CONTINUED:                                                      68A \nHARRY I'll go rush order it for you now. \nJILL (beaming) Thank you so much. \nCecily rolls her eyes.     Jill winks at her conspiratorially. \nCECILY (to Harry) She's nice. I'm not. If you forget to order something I need, I'll knock you upside the head. \nCecily and Harry walk off grumbling at each other like an old married couple. \nHARRY I keep telling you -- stop talking to me like that. \nCECILY Please.   You love it. \nJill smiles to herself. She turns to get back to her other business, and almost walks right into: \nGregg. He's been leaning against a wall, and he's caught the whole thing. \nGREGG Lobelia leaves. Should have called me in Africa. I would have brought 'em back for ya. \nJill just stares for a moment, trying to decide how to handle Gregg's sudden reappearnce. His clothes look travelled in, and another month in Africa has put a deeper shade of brown on his face. He's got the ragged look of someone who's just gotten off a 16-hour flight. \nGREGG Nice to see you running the place, Jill. \nJill nods and starts walking like someone with urgent business to attend to. Gregg falls in beside her. \nJILL You're back early. What happened? Run out of humvees to crash? \n(CONTINUED) \n68A   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                68A \nGREGG No -- just wanted to get back. \nJILL (frosty) Really? And why is that? \nGREGG Guess I missed Harry. \nGregg smiles teasingly at Jill but she's in no mood to melt that easily. He continues. \nGREGG They want me to show my face at the fundraiser tomorrow night... and I guess I got my mind fixed on a good meal in a fine restaurant. Thought you might like to join me. \nJILL (cool) No thanks. I still don't want to leave Joe. \nGREGG 'Still'? Haven't you been out of here yet? \nJILL (flip) What's to see? Beach is that way, mountains are that way, Mexico's that way, Canada's that way... \nGregg reaches out and slows her down.    He wants to see her eyes. \nGREGG Come on. Have dinner with me, Jill. (tenderly) You won't find a better excuse to brush your hair. \nGregg reaches out and pulls a piece of straw from Jill's tossled locks. She can't help herself anymore -- and breaks into a slow smile. \nJILL I'll brush my hair if you take a shower. \nGREGG (grins) Deal. \n68B   EXT. OUTSIDE JOE'S HABITAT - DAY                              68B \nGarth walks quickly -- but not fast enough to draw attention. He moves along the handrail at the edge of the moat. Takes off his sunglasses and looks for Joe. \nGARTH'S POV - JOE \nis moving slowly among saplings. \nCLOSE ON GARTH'S HAND \nas he reaches in his pocket and pulls out one of the poaching dog collars. Garth looks around -- then gives the metal clappers one loud shake -- quickly drops them back into his pocket. \nJoe reacts immediately to the JANGLING sound. Imprinted deep in his memory. He rises up quickly and GROWLS furiously -- pounding his chest -- looking around for the danger. It's instinctive and frightening. Joe sees Garth and charges him. Joe's anger takes him into the electrified wire around the habitat. JOE ROARS at the shock and recoils. \nGARTH You remember, don't you? \n69    OMITTED                                                       69 \n69A   EXT. VENICE BEACH - NIGHT                                     69A \nIt's a beautiful and lively night on Venice Beach. A few people have made bonfires along the water's edge, and the MUSIC of a DISTANT bar band wafts through the air. It's a magic night. \nGregg and Jill walk away from a funky food shack, festooned with tiny lights. They share a carton of fish and chips. \nJILL So this is what you call a good meal in a fine restaurant? \nGREGG (thinks about it) Yeah. \nGregg grins at Jill, all boyish charm. She stiffles a smile, struggling to hold on to her pervious indignation. \n(CONTINUED) \n69A   CONTINUED:                                                       69A \nJILL Don't point that smile at me. I'm still mad at you for taking off and leaving me here all alone. \nGREGG (guilty) I'm sorry -- I had things I had to do... \nJILL (doesn't buy it) Uh-huh... \nGREGG Besides, you weren't all alone. You had Joe. \nAs Strasser and Garth leave, Joe looks after them, beside himself with fury. Outraged, he turns this way and that way, finally focusing on a tall tree in his habitat. \n78   INT. TENT - NIGHT                                              78 \nAt the podium, Baker is making his presentation to the tony crowd. \nBAKER ... and now to introduce our remarkable new acquisition, I would like to bring up to the podium the director of the conservancy... \nA sudden ROAR coming from behind the curtain drowns out Baker's voice. The audience members jump in their seats, frightened. Baker is rattled, too, then regains his composure. \nBAKER Well! I suppose there's no need to add to that introduction. \nThe audience laughs and relaxes. \nBAKER Here's Dr. Harry Ruben. \nBaker motions to Harry, who freezes with a sudden bout of stage fright. Cecily gives him a discreet push on the back and he stumbles forward. \nJOE can still be heard GROWLING and beating his chest in the background. Jill and Gregg look at each other with mounting anxiety. \nHarry reaches the mic. \nHARRY (into mic) In the time it took you to drive here tonight, three species have disappeared from the Earth. Extinct. Never to return. We here at the conservancy say this is a tragedy... \nAnother O.S. ROAR from JOE. It is spine-tingling.    Harry almost jumps out of his loafers. \nHARRY (nervous joke) Obviously Joe agrees. \nEverybody laughs. The audience doesn't know enough to be really afraid -- they're just excited and twittering. \n(CONTINUED) \n78   CONTINUED:                                                     78 \nJill is feeling increasingly nervous. She glances around the room and meets eyes with Strasser. He nods at her, his eyes indicating that he is \"worried\" for Joe as well. Jill nods back. \nWe continue to hear uncanny SOUNDS from behind the curtain. It's all Harry can do to stick to his speech. He keeps glancing nervously over his shoulder. \nHARRY But tonight, rather than focusing on what we've lost, I'm going to introduce you to something we've found. \nThere is a tremendous CRACKING sound from behind the curtain. The audience murmurs. Harry sweats. Jill grabs Gregg's hand tightly. \nHARRY Ladies and gentlemen, the California Animal Conservancy proudly introduces our newest member, Mighty Joe... \nCRASH! Before Harry can say \"Young,\" a TREE comes CRASHING through the curtain. \nGregg leaps forward, knocking Harry out of the way just as the tree crushes the podium into kindling. \nJoe comes blasting through the hole in the curtain.    He has joined the party. \nJoe stands on the stage, his chest heaving. There is total silence. The party guests are frozen with fear, literally speechless. A few of them laugh nervously, wondering if this is really just part of the show. \nBut Jill knows better. She and Gregg exchange glances -- what the hell is going on? \nJill rises, trying to stay calm herself, and slowly approaches Joe, speaking in a soothing voice. She wants to get his attention. \nJILL (soothing) Hey, Joe. I'm right here. You hear me? Good boy. Take it easy, Joe. We don't want to scare anybody, do we? \n(CONTINUED) \n78   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                   78 \nJill is within arm's reach of Joe -- it looks like he might turn his head to her, calm down, become docile... \nBut that's when he spots Strasser. Joe's face registers towering rage as Strasser stares back, provoking Joe further. \nJoe takes off, knocking over a table that bangs into Jill and sends her flying backwards into a wall. She hits the wall and sinks down, stunned. \nJOE \nheads through the people towards Strasser.        The party erupts with screams. \nJoe makes his way towards Strasser, swatting people out of the way. \nON STRASSER \nFrozen, in horror, as Joe plows through the party, heading straight for him. Tables are broken like match sticks, GLASS SHATTERS. \nJoe catches up to Strasser, grabs his tuxedo jacket and hoists him into the air. \nCLOSE ON MAN \nIt's not Strasser. Frustrated, Joe flings him aside. The man flies through the air, slamming into the tent wall, and then falling on the catering table. \nON GREGG AND JILL \nAs they watch Joe's rampage in horror. \nJILL My God.   What's wrong with him? \nGREGG We've got to bring him down.   I'm going for the tranq guns. \nJILL No -- let me stop him. \n(CONTINUED) \n78   CONTINUED:    (3)                                             78 \nBut Gregg's already taken off. \nMEANWHILE \nMighty Joe is still looking for Strasser, as he heads back across the room. \nA glamorous couple, (TERRY and RAY), crawls frantically on all fours, trying to stay ahead of Joe. \nTERRY (frantic) Faster! Faster! \nRAY I'm trying! \nJust then, Vern and Jack drive up in a Blazer.      They stop next to Gregg and Cecily. \nGREGG What're you guys doing here so late? \nJack and Vern hop out of the car.       Vern is carrying a cardboard box. \nJACK Baker wants the tent cleaned up A.S.A.P. \nVern holds out the box. \nVERN Check out the loot we plundered in the wake of mass party panic! This is some weird lost and found, man. \nVern pulls a single high-heeled shoe out of the box and hands it to Cecily. \nJACK Yeah, and we've got the fun job of getting this stuff back to everybody. (pulls out a toupee) Somebody's head is cold! \nDigging in the box again, Vern innocently pulls out the poacher's dog collar. It means nothing to him, but Gregg instantly grabs for it. \nGREGG (alarmed) Where did you find this? \nVERN Oh -- that was by the habitat. (to Jack) Guess we've got to find those two guys again. \nGREGG (urgent) What two guys? \n(CONTINUED) 91D. \n88B   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               88B \nJACK That, uh... (to Vern) What do you think that one guy is? Russian? Lithuanian? \nIt takes less than a second. Gregg springs into action, grabbing the keys to the Blazer out of Jack's hand. He sprints to the car. Jack and Vern watch him go. \nCECILY (calling after him) Be careful! \nThey watch him go. \n89    INT. CAB OF CONSERVANCY TRUCK - NIGHT                           89 \nJill glances nervously back as they drive down surface streets. She looks over at Strasser. In the passing light of the street lamps, he is regaining his sinister sheen. \nGarth is driving the trailer very fast. They hit a bump, making them lurch in their seat. Jill hears JOE go THUD in the trailer. \nJILL Please!   Be careful... \nSTRASSER Always worrying, eh? Your mother was a worrier, too. Always worrying about the gorillas. It made her a lot of enemies. It led to tragedy. \nHis tone has something vaguely malevolent in it.    It rankles Jill. \nJILL My mother was brave. \nSTRASSER So are you, my dear. \nJill looks at Strasser sharply. For the first time, she really notices his strange, leather hand. For reasons she's not yet conscious of, it scares her. \nStrasser notices that Jill is staring at his hand. \n(CONTINUED) \n89   CONTINUED:                                                    89 \nSTRASSER It's not so pretty, I know. \nJILL (looking away) I'm sorry. (beat) What happened? \nStrasser and Garth exchange amused glances. \nSTRASSER Well... you could say I had an encounter with a monster. (in Roumanian) Monstrule. \nStrasser and Garth chuckle -- they think they're just sharing a private joke. \nBut Jill has a troubled look in her eyes -- the foreign epithet has struck a chord from long ago... she struggles to remember... \nThen she gets it. She sees herself crouching in the forest with Joe over 12 years ago, overhearing Strasser's curses, and her blood runs cold. She glances at Strasser, everything dawning on her at once. The hand... the face... it all comes together for Jill. \nStrasser catches the look on Jill's face and knows some- thing is wrong. Adrenaline is pumping through her. Unsure of how to make her next move, Jill tries to hide the realization that is crashing down on her... \nShe glances in the side view mirror of the truck and sees: \nGregg, driving up behind them in the Conservancy vehicle. Jill's face reacts ever so slightly, but Strasser catches it. He follows her eye line, looking where she looked, and as he also spots Gregg, Jill knows the game is up. She loses it and screams: \nJILL Murdering bastard! \nJill slams her elbow into Strasser's nose. Strasser's face reflexively goes down in his hands. Stunned, Garth swerves at the wheel. Fast as lightning, Jill grabs his hair and slams his face into the dash. \nBefore the men can recover, Jill kicks and claws her way over Strasser's back, fighting toward the open window... \n(CONTINUED) \n89    CONTINUED:    (2)                                              89 \nShe reaches through the window and grabs onto the side view mirror. The truck door swings open and Jill sails out the door, dangling from her hold on the side view. \nThe speeding truck swerves wildly, banging Jill again and again against the door. \nGregg sees her and is horrified at the danger.   He speeds up, trying to reach her... \nStrasser grabs for Jill, trying to pull her back into the truck... she kicks at him and loses her grasp on the side view mirror. \n90    EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT                                       90 \nJill falls, hitting the running board and bouncing hard onto the concrete roadway. \nTwo CARS swerve and CRASH around her. \n91    INT. TRAILER HOLD                                              91 \nJOE'S POV \nTHROUGH the slats in the trailer, Joe sees Jill almost being hit by the cars. He goes crazy, trying to get out, rocking the trailer back and forth... \n112   CONTINUED:                                                      112 \nIt's almost like church. The freeway becomes quiet. Nobody honks. Nobody screams. \nOvercome with awe, a woman steps out of her car and just stands there in the middle of the freeway, watching Joe pass. Others follow suit. \nJoe climbs the center divider.    The same thing happens in the southbound lane. \nAs Joe disappears up the hill on the other side, the stunned drivers simply stare in disbelief. L.A. is in awe. \n113   OMITTED                                                         113 \n114   INT. CONSERVANCY VEHICLE (FREEWAY OVERPASS)                     114 \nGregg and Jill arrive on the scene. \nThey look down from the overpass and see cops swarming around the area where Joe was, shining their flashlights into the brush and talking to motorists. \nGREGG Any idea where he might've headed? \nON JILL -- drifting off, as something O.S. catches her attention. \nJILL Look. \nShe points out THROUGH the windshield. \nLONG SHOT - JILL'S POV - THROUGH WINDSHIELD \nShining over the horizon, coming from somewhere near the ocean, is a searchlight, piercing the night sky. The image is as familiar to Jill as it was to Joe. \nBACK TO SCENE \nJILL That's where he'll go. He'll think that's me calling him. \nGregg steps on the accelerator. As their car pulls away, PAN TO Strasser and Garth following a few car lengths behind. \n115   OMITTED                                                          115 \n116   HELICOPTER SHOT - MOVING ACROSS BAY - NIGHT                      116 \nThe moon-striped water surges and ebbs as we SKIM the waves, RUSHING TOWARDS -- \n117   EXT. PALISADES OCEAN PARK - NIGHT                                117 \nA festival of lights.   Rides, arcades, lots of people. \nCLOSE ON SEARCHLIGHT \nA kettle light rotating on its base. CAMERA CRANES UP THROUGH the klieg beams REVEALING the park -- CONTINUE TO CRANE UP 'til we see, towering over everything, the new Ferris wheel -- a neon blur spinning grandly against the moon-bright sky. \n118   EXT. PALISADES OCEAN PARK - VARIOUS SHOTS - NIGHT                118 \nQuintessentially American images of beach-side amusement park. A carnival-like atmosphere. \nANGLE - ARCHWAY ENTRANCE \nSome couples stop to take their photos, kissing under the iconic neon arch that welcomes people to the park. \nYOUNG COUPLE \nstops to share the view -- and a kiss.   Until a LOUD GROWL makes them jump back. \nJoe has appeared under the arch. The young girl screams -- her boyfriend pulls her back. \nJOE'S POV \nIt's like a slow-motion panic. The noise and tumult of the crowded park keeps people from hearing the screams right away. \nOne toddler smiles and waves at Joe until his mother snatches him and runs for dear life. \n(CONTINUED) \n118   CONTINUED:                                                     118 \nAT FERRIS WHEEL \nA crowd of kids waits in line. One of them, a particularly appealing little boy named JASON, is having a conversation with his MOTHER. She has the aura of a single mom about her, and she clearly adores her sweet-faced kid. \nJASON Mom, I don't think I can let you go on the ferris wheel. \nJASON'S MOTHER Why not? \nJASON Because the last time after you ate two hot dogs, you threw up, remember? \nJASON'S MOTHER What if I promised to throw up over the side? \nThey both giggle at her joke. \nJASON Mom, I think I should do this ride by myself. \nJASON'S MOTHER (reluctant) Okay... I'll watch you. \nTILT UP TO the wheel turning majestically -- filled with kids. Some wave from the chairs as they crest -- it feels like they're flying over the ocean below. \nWe NOTICE two girls (JENNY, seven, and EMMA, nine) as they come over the top. On the way down, they can see the crowd parting below as Joe ENTERS FRAME. \nAt the base of the great wheel -- parents are finally hearing the commotion. \nBY LIGHT \nJoe arrives at his destination -- the bright light that drew him here. He's confused by the fact that Jill's nowhere to be found. Desperately, he scans the park... \nPeople scream and panic around Joe. The noise drives him deeper into the park, searching for Jill. Meanwhile -- \n(CONTINUED) \n118   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                118 \nAT ARCADE - BIG SAFARI BOOTH \nJILL What was that? \nThen they spot the fire, spreading to the Ferris wheel. Gregg turns to Jill. \nGREGG Go find Joe, get him out of here. (looking towards the wheel) I'm gonna see if I can help. \nGregg moves off towards the Ferris wheel. \nJILL \nheads over to the carnival games. \nCUT TO: \n124   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS ACTION                                   124 \nStrasser, calm and totally committed to his course of action moves through the pandemonium of the crowd, gun by his side. \nCUT TO: \nAT FERRIS WHEEL \nParents are shouting, crowding the Ferris wheel. Two operators are unloading children as quickly as they can. \nThey look like they are about to be overwhelmed but then... \nGregg ENTERS FRAME. He vaults the guard rail, starts unloading children right from their moving cars. \nThere is utter chaos, children screaming, fire and smoke. CRANE UP PAST the terrified faces of the children who have to wait, 'til we GET TO Jenny and Emma. Jenny turns to see the fire beneath them. \n(CONTINUED) \n124   CONTINUED:                                                       124 \nFIRE \nis really starting to burn out of control now. It has spread to the engine of the FERRIS WHEEL, which, heated to the bursting point, suddenly EXPLODES. \nThe ride operator with the fire extinguisher is blown through the air, and the Ferris wheel lurches to a halt. \nJENNY AND EMMA \ngrip their safety bar as their bucket swings back and forth. Emma nearly falls out -- until Jenny grabs her and holds her tight. \nJENNY Mo-om!! \nJENNY'S MOTHER Oh my God!   Somebody help! \nGregg -- sees the girls, their bucket having come to a stop about fifteen feet off the ground. Thinking quickly, he jumps up on the guard railing, then leaps across to their bucket. \nHe just grabs onto the bottom. The bucket shakes back and forth violently, causing the two girls to scream. Gregg looks up at them. \nGREGG Don't be scared. Climb down my back. \nThe girls look at Gregg, too nervous to move. \nGREGG Come on. \nTentatively, Jenny and Emma climb out of their bucket and onto Gregg's back, using him like a human ladder. They shimmy down to his feet, then drop off, one by one, into the waiting arms of their mother. \nGregg lets go of the bucket, drops a good fifteen feet, landing roughly. The girls' mother looks down at Gregg, thankfully. \nJENNY'S MOTHER Thank you!   Oh God, thank you! \nGregg, winded, just nods. \nCUT TO: \n125   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - PARKING LOT - NIGHT                         125 \nA phalanx of cop cars races up to the park. \n126   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NEAR CARNIVAL GAMES                         126 \nJill moves through the maze of carnival games. She spots Joe, moving through the small buildings, clearly disoriented. She yells out... \nJILL Joe!   Joe!! \nBut above the tumult, he can't hear her. Jill pushes her way towards him, when she comes face to face with... \nStrasser. Just yards away.      He flashes his sickening smile, raises his gun... \nON JILL -- a look of terror crossing her face as she realizes she's about to die. Then, as a shadow passes over her, her expression of terror melts away. \nON STRASSER -- seeing Jill's expression, his smile fades. Why's she so calm all of a sudden? He doesn't even need to turn around to know that: \nJoe is behind him. As Strasser turns slowly around, Joe reaches down swiftly and hoists Strasser off the ground. The GUN GOES OFF, barely missing Joe. JOE ROARS and crushes Strasser's left hand in his paw, a bone-crunching, slow squeeze that makes Strasser scream in agony. \nThen Joe swings Strasser around and grabs him around the chest with his right paw. He pulls him close to his face and blasts a DEAFENING ROAR into his face. Joe cocks his arm and heaves Strasser with mighty force into the air. \nScreaming, Strasser hurtles through space with incredible speed, CRASHING right through the flaming signage of the \"Big Safari\" booth, sending out a SHOWER OF SPARKS... \n... and continues flying through the air until WHACK!      He hangs up on a power line. \nStrasser slips down, catching his fall with his fake hand. This section of the LINE is safe, but directly below it is a cluster of electrical junction boxes. Cracked and blistered by the heat of the nearby fire, they are sparking dangerously -- to fall on to them would mean certain electrocution. \n(CONTINUED) \n126   CONTINUED:                                                      126 \nStrasser's bad hand begins to slip from the wire. Desperate, he reaches up with his left hand to grab on -- only to remember that this hand has just been crushed by Joe, and is useless to him now. \nStrasser helplessly watches as his prosthetic comes unclasped from his hand and he slips the last, fatal fraction of an inch. \nStrasser falls onto the junction boxes, which explode in a shower of sparks. Strasser sizzles and dies, while above him, the prosthesis still swings on the wire. \n127   EXT. PARK - CONTINUOUS ACTION                                   127 \nJill stands where she is, frozen at the horrible sight of what has just happened. A dozen people scream and recoil. \nON GROUND \nAll eyes watch, in awe, as Joe presses Jason to his massive chest. \nON JILL -- smiling through tears.    Gregg puts an arm around her. \nBEHIND THEM \nCamera crews from local TV news stations have poured into the park. They film all of this. \nAT BASE OF WHEEL \nThe wood attached to the metal supports has completely burned through. With a terrible CRACKING sound, the SUPPORTS begin to tear away. \nAnother EXPLOSION rocks the WHEEL.   It SHUDDERS. \nJASON'S MOTHER Oh, please, no... \nWIDEN SHOT -- The Ferris wheel begins to tip over. \nON JILL -- a look of horror passes over her face as well. \nGREGG It's going to tip! Everyone back up! \nEveryone starts backing away from the wheel. \nThe wheel seems to fall slowly -- like in a dream -- sending debris and flames spilling across the park. \nON JOE \nAs he cradles Jason tight in his arms. \nThe wheel begins to fall towards the ground. \n(CONTINUED) \n128   CONTINUED:                                                      128 \nJoe jumps away from the burning wheel -- \nPOV SHOT \nAs the ground comes rushing up at him. \nJOE \nhits hard, just clearing the falling wheel by inches.

Jason's Mother races with her. \nON JOE \nMotionless on his back. Still cupping the boy, nestled and protected against his massive chest. A beat -- then Jason looks up from Joe -- \nJASON Mom? \nJason's Mother bursts into joyous sobs as her son climbs into her arms. A general sense of relief passes through the crowd, except for... \nJILL \nShe kneels by Joe stroking his great chest. Joe doesn't respond. Jill bows her head and cries deeply. \nPeople back away to give her room. How strange to see this huge, powerful animal stilled. \nGregg comes and kneels by Joe's side. He checks for a heart beat. For wounds. Joe doesn't stir. Gregg is devastated, too. \nPAN CROWD... \nFiremen, paramedics and television reporters run through the park. The paramedics lead off the wounded. \n(CONTINUED) \n128   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              128 \nStill holding her boy, Jason's Mother comes forward. She recognizes what Jill is going through her own version of mother's grief. She approaches respectfully... \nJASON'S MOTHER I'm so sorry... \nJill is beyond comfort. She's in another world. Humming their lullaby, she rests her soft cheek in Joe's giant paw for the last time. Her blonde hair spills on his fingers... \nAnd then, SLOWLY ENTERING FRAME, a giant finger reaches for Jill's cheek and strokes it gently... \nIt takes Jill a moment to realize she hasn't imagined this... she opens her eyes, sees the moving fingers, turns to look into Joe's face, just as his eyes open... \nElated, Jill moves up to Joe's head and kisses his face a thousand times. Gregg takes a deep breath, privately thanking God. Jason's Mother is tearful -- Jason is all smiles. \nJill tearfully blathers soothing words... \nJILL (kissing Joe's head) That's right, Joe -- that's right, big guy. That was a big fall but you're okay, aren't you? You're tough. You're so tough. Yes you are. Yes you are. \nGREGG (checking Joe over) We've got to get him checked out. (looking around at crowd) And get him somewhere safe. \nJill looks at Gregg with a heavy heart. \nJILL (bitter/rhetorical) Somewhere safe? Where is that? \nJason's Mother breaks in timidly. \n(CONTINUED) \n128   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                 128 \nJASON'S MOTHER (stammering) Perhaps...

Stop worrying about Joe, and start worrying about what you'll wear tomorrow night. \nWith that, Baker gives Jill his back and starts a phone call. Frustrated, Jill turns and walks out of the room. \n74   EXT. CONSERVANCY GROUNDS - CONTINUOUS ACTION                      74 \nJill storms out of Baker's office stewing, head down. She's walking so fast that she collides into a man coming the other way. \nJILL Oh!   Excuse me. \nThe man rights himself and smiles politely. \nSTRASSER No, excuse me.     My fault. \nIt's Strasser. He's tamed his looks and dressed himself in modest attire. With his damaged hand concealed in his pocket and a pleasant smile arranged on his face, he has re-invented himself. He comes across like a friendly conservationist. \nHe stares openly at Jill.       It flusters her. \nSTRASSER (feigning surprise) I'm so sorry -- it's just -- you must be Jill Young... \nJILL Yes...? \nSTRASSER (\"moved\") And -- you look just like her. \nThe words electrify Jill.       She almost gasps. \nSTRASSER I'm Andre Strasser. An old friend of your mother's. (warmly) I knew her when she was only a little older than you, and you were just a tiny thing. What an incredible woman she was. (CONTINUED) \n74   CONTINUED:                                                      74 \nJill is overwhelmed.     She immediately melts.   She reaches her hand out to him. \nJILL How wonderful to meet you.   What are you doing here? \nStrasser pretends to look uncomfortable. \nSTRASSER I've come to talk with your Mr. Baker. (pained) You see, I am here for Joe. And, in a way, for your mother, too. (passionate) I believe she would agree with me -- a magnificent wild animal like Joe needs more space -- like the Raha Preserve I run in Botswana. \nBingo.   Jill's face falls.    The guilt is working already. \nJILL Raha?   A preserve? \nSTRASSER I have twenty thousand acres there where the animals are free to run. I would like to offer them to Joe. (sighs) Here, it's such a shame... to see Joe living in a man-made habitat and being used as an attraction to raise money... \nStrasser shakes his head at the inhumanity of it all. His clever words work on Jill like a charm -- she looks absolutely crestfallen. He pretends to comfort her. \nSTRASSER Oh -- I've upset you! Please... I only mean to offer an alternative. I will be attending the event tomorrow night. Maybe we can talk more about this matter then. \nJILL I'll look forward to it. \nSTRASSER Good-bye. \nStrasser walks off, leaving Jill deep in thought. He smiles to himself, certain he's landed a direct hit. \n75   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - NIGHT                                     75 \nA tent has been set up outside Joe's habitat, the long end flush up against the railing that surrounds the moat. \nCUT TO: \n76   INT. TENT - NIGHT                                              76 \nA small, elegant and tasteful party. A collection of fifty VIPs, all dressed to the nines, mingle with the conservancy staff. Tables have been arranged in a wide semi-circle around a podium, which is on the moat edge of the tent. \nBY BAR \nGregg, wearing a tuxedo, walks up to Cecily and Harry, also in black tie. Harry is stuffing his face. \nCecily looks admiringly at Gregg. \nCECILY Don't you clean up nice. \nGREGG Cecily -- you're ravishing. Harry -- you got shrimp on your shirt. \nHarry looks down at his shirt smeared with cocktail sauce. \nHARRY (dismayed) Of course. I look ridiculous. \nCECILY No.  You look fine. (pointing at Jack and Vern) They look ridiculous. \nJack and Vern are off the dweeb-scale in their ill-fitting tuxes. They crowd the food table, gobbling down appetizers. \nHARRY Hel-lo.   Look what we have here. \nGregg and Cecily turn to see what Harry's looking at. \n(CONTINUED) \n76   CONTINUED:                                                      76 \nBY ENTRANCE \nJill has just stepped into the tent, looking absolutely stunning. All heads turn too look at her. Intimidated, she falters at the door, too afraid to enter. \nBACK ON STAFF \nLike everyone else in the room, Cecily and Harry admire Jill. Gregg is rendered speechless by her beauty. \nCECILY (proud) I picked out the dress.   Aren't I smart? \n", "test1_true": "Gregg picks up a glass of champagne for Jill and starts crossing the room to her. \nCECILY Shut your mouth, Harry -- you're catching flies. \nON JILL \nFeeling terribly insecure, Jill gratefully watches Gregg cross the room towards her. They can't take their eyes off each other. When he reaches her side, she grabs on to him. \nJILL (self-conscious) Tell me the truth -- do I look stupid in this? Everyone is staring at me. \nGREGG (reassuring) They're not staring at you. (looks around) They're staring at that... uh... banana tower. \nJill turns and sees a ridiculous-looking decorative mountain of bananas sitting on a table top just behind her. It's the creation of an over-zealous caterer. \nJill blushes, realizing Gregg's joking. \n(CONTINUED) \n76   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              76 \nJILL Very funny. \nACROSS ROOM \nStrasser and Garth observe the crowd. \nGARTH Quite a turnout they have here. \nSTRASSER All the better. \nBAKER (O.S.) Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please? \nStrasser puts his drink down, taps Garth. \nSTRASSER Let's go. \nThe two of them head for the exit. \nAT PODIUM - WITH BAKER \nBAKER When was the last time you laid eyes on something so unique, so spectacular, that it literally took your breath away? Well, prepare yourselves, for tonight you will have such an experience. \nWITH STRASSER AND GARTH \nHeading for the exit, they hear Baker's words and exchange a knowing glance -- if they have their way, tonight will be more of an \"experience\" than Baker is bargaining for. Garth slips his hand into his jacket, checking for the dog collar... \nJust as Jack and Vern start coming the other way. Jack's already had one glass too many, and he's reckless on his feet. \nJACK (to Vern) There's nothing in this punch, man. I could drink twelve of these and not feel a thing. \n(CONTINUED) \n76   CONTINUED:    (3)                                                  76 \nSmack! Jack collides with Garth, causing Garth to drop the dog collar. Vern stoops to retrieve it, (picking it up by a rusty key that is one of the clanking objects on the collar). \nVERN Sorry!   Here's your... uh... key chain. \nGarth grabs it back.      Strasser nods coolly to Vern and Jack. \nSTRASSER Thank you. \nVern and Jack stumble on, none the wiser. \nStrasser and Garth slip out. \n77   EXT. JOE'S HABITAT - CONTINUOUS ACTION                             77 \nJoe is feeding on bamboo in the center of his habitat when something abruptly catches his ear. A slight JANGLING sound, the TIMPANI of WIND CHIMES, floating through the air. It GROWS LOUDER. \nJoe stands up. The hair on his neck bristles. He moves towards the source of the sound, at the edge of the moat. \nJOE'S POV \nGarth stands at the railing surrounding the moat, rattling the dog collars. It's a sound that haunts him, from the darkest depths of his memory. He starts to GROWL and then he sees something that really drives him nuts. \nStrasser steps into the light, joining Garth by the water's edge. He rattles the dog collar, and now... \nZOOM IN ON JOE \nHis eyes, locking with Strasser's. His pupils narrow, his nostrils flare, and Joe FREAKS OUT! \nHe starts tearing up the ground, beating his chest, then he ROARS and charges straight for them, stopping at the water's edge. \n(CONTINUED) \n77   CONTINUED:                                                     77 \nON STRASSER \nlocking eyes with Joe. This is the first time he has seen Joe since the animal bit his hand off twelve years ago. A smile creeps across his face. \nSTRASSER (to himself) So you haven't forgotten me.   Good. (holding up his dead hand) Have you forgotten this? \nGarth is still rattling the dog collar, enjoying Joe's display of rage. \nGARTH What do you think the big guy is worth? A couple million? \nSTRASSER I will get that for the paws alone. After we sell him off piece by piece, who knows how much we'll make? \nGarth shakes the dog collar more furiously, making Joe rush at them again. \nGARTH Got you going now! That should rattle the jewelry off the ladies. \nSTRASSER (indicating dog collar) Hang it there -- where he can see it. (warning) And come back for it -- after. \nGarth hangs the dog collar on the fence. Joe can hear it clank in the breeze -- he is in a truly frightening state. \nSTRASSER Come, we've done our job here. \n", "test2_input": "HARRY Can I talk to you for a second? \nJill nods. She takes one last look at Joe, then walks out of the room, leaving... \nGregg, alone with Joe for the first time since Joe held him upside down in the jungle. \nGregg leans against the cage next to Joe. They have never been in such close proximity before. The expressive-ness in Joe's eyes is uncanny -- Gregg feels almost as if he could understand what he's saying. \nGREGG (deeply sorry) Well this wasn't in the brochure, was it? \nGregg looks around at the claustrophobic space. \nGREGG I promised you wouldn't be put in a cage. I'm sorry, Joe. I helped put you here. And now I'm going to do everything I can to get you out. \nGregg reaches out for Joe's paw and lays his hand in it. Joe gently curls his fingers around Gregg's hand. \n83   EXT. OBSERVATION AREA - BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ACTION             83 \nJill and Harry are in the observation area, a glassed-off room that looks into the holding cell. Harry is still extremely rattled from the fiasco of the night before. He's trying to act tough but he's torn up inside, not sure who he's worried about more -- Joe or himself. \nHARRY The City Attorney talked to Baker. It wasn't my decision, and there's nothing I can do about it. \nJILL About what? \nHARRY Joe stays in there until they decide what to do with him. \nJILL (freaking out) In there? Harry, look at him. He's depressed, he won't eat. If he stays in there, he'll die within days. \nHARRY So sue me.    Everybody else is. \nJILL Listen, Harry, either you tell them you're getting Joe out of there or I will! \nHARRY Don't you get it? This is way beyond you, and me. Joe freaked out on some very influential people. He's a public relations nightmare. No zoo will take a two-thousand-pound killer gorilla... \nJILL (interrupting) He's not a killer! \nHARRY ... and unless you can write a check for millions of dollars to buy him a big back yard somewhere, Joe's got nowhere to go. \nJILL That's it?    You're not going to do anything? \n(CONTINUED) \n83   CONTINUED:                                                     83 \nHarry looks at Jill's angry face -- he knows he's just lost her respect and it bugs him more than he'd like to admit. But there's nothing more he can say. \nHe leaves the room, brushing shoulders with Gregg, entering. Judging from the expression on Gregg's face, he's overheard the whole thing. \nJill and Gregg look at each other with determination in their eyes. There's no question in either of their minds about what needs to be done next. \nJILL I need your help. \nGREGG You got it. \n84   EXT. BUNKER - NIGHT                                            84 \nAn ANIMAL CONTROL OFFICER stands guard outside the bunker. \nGregg, Cecily, and Jill walk casually towards the Officer. The Officer straightens up and looks tough. He comes forward halfway to meet them. \nCECILY (big smile) Good evening. \nA.C. OFFICER 'Evening. \nOur three just breeze on by the Officer into the bunker. \nA.C. OFFICER Hey, wait a minute! \nGregg hangs back with the A.C. Officer as Cecily and Jill disappear inside. To buy time for Cecily and Jill, Gregg pretends to take the big lug into his confidences. \nGREGG (confidential) We're conservancy doctors. Do me a favor -- stay here and guard the door. \nThe guard nods and looks confused.    Gregg disappears inside. \n85   INT. BUNKER - AT CAGE                                        85 \nCecily takes a key from her pocket and opens the door to Joe's cage. \nJILL Come on, Joe. We're leaving. Let's get you out of here. \nThe open door has a stronger effect on Joe than the sedatives in his system. He clambers to his feet and follows Jill out of the cage. \n(CONTINUED) \n85   CONTINUED:                                                     85 \nA.C. OFFICER (O.S.) What the hell are you doing? \nThey turn to see the Officer has a rifle aimed at Joe. He's terrified. JOE GROWLS ominously. \nCECILY I'm Dr. Banks, the head vet. And I'm taking Joe for a CAT Scan. \nA.C. OFFICER I take my orders from Mr. Baker. Put him back in the cage. Now. \nThe Officer trains his gun on Joe. Joe looks at the Officer menacingly and bares his huge fangs. \nGREGG (friendly voice) Officer, you don't want to point that gun at him, believe me. \nThe Officer suddenly grabs his neck, which now has a tranquilizer dart sticking out of it. \nJill lowers a tranq gun. \nJILL (simply) He didn't believe you. \nThe Officer slumps to the ground. \n86   EXT. BUNKER - CONTINUOUS ACTION                                86 \nCecily steps out of the bunker and blinks a flashlight into the dark. \n", "test2_true": "Cecily calls out towards the bunker: \nCECILY Bring him out. \nNow Jill and Gregg lead Joe outside as Cecily opens the doors to the trailer.

Avoiding the back of the trailer (where he would encounter Joe), Strasser stays where he is and calls out to Jill in hushed tones. \nSTRASSER Jill, I got the plane. It's waiting at the airport. We must hurry. \nStrasser holds his hand up in salute to Gregg and Cecily -- that's about as close as he wants to get to them. Using urgency as an excuse, he jumps back into the trailer before anyone can engage him in further conversation. \nIt's time to say good-bye.    Cecily looks into the back of the trailer. \nCECILY I'm going to miss your ugly face. Be good, Joe. \nHARRY (O.S.) Yeah. Don't start a fight with anyone bigger than you. \nHarry steps out of the shadows. Everyone turns and looks at him. He feels their eyes on him and shuffles a little. \nHARRY You'd better leave out of the west gate. The guard there got called away. Urgent business. \nJill puts her arms around Harry.    He's antsy and embarrassed. \nJILL You're not such a big coward after all. \nHARRY (as she keeps hugging) Okay, okay, let go. \nHarry disengages from Jill and disappears back where he came from. \nNow Cecily turns to Jill.    She hugs her with great emotion. \nCECILY Write me when Joe gets settled. \n(CONTINUED) 91A. \n87   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              87 \nJILL I promise. \nCecily moves off, leaving Gregg and Jill alone to say good-bye. They look into each other's eyes, hating to part, everything they have to say to each other still unsaid. \nJILL (yearning) You coming to the airport, or...? \nGREGG (strained) I think I better stay here and keep people away from that bunker. Give you a head start before they realize he's gone. \nJill is crumbling. For her, it's awful to leave him, but he's not acting heart-broken at all. Confused, she tries desperately to stay light. She chatters like a nervous schoolgirl. \nJILL (stammering) Well -- if you're ever in Botswana, come by and take me out to a good meal in a fine restaurant. That is, if you're not afraid to tell Joe that you'll get me home by... \nShe doesn't get the rest of her sentence out because Gregg is kissing her mouth. It's the kiss he's been wanting to give her since the day he first laid eyes on her. \nHe lets go of her again, leaving her breathlessly looking after him. He walks to the back of the trailer. \nGregg and Joe make serious eyes contact. \nGREGG (pointedly, to Joe) Take care of her for me, will ya? \nGregg shuts the trailer door and walks off, not daring to look back. Jill is about to call after him when Strasser steps back out of the passenger's side of the trailer. He whispers urgently: \nSTRASSER Jill!   We must go! \nJill runs to the passenger side of the trailer. 91B. \n87A   INT.

TRAILER - THAT MOMENT                                      88 \nGregg stops and turns around for one last look at the trailer as it drives off. \nCecily exhales -- this love stuff is too hot to handle -- and follows Gregg. \n88A   EXT./INT. TRUCK/STREET - NIGHT                                  88A \nJill sits nervously between Strasser and Garth as the trailer leaves the gate of the conservancy. \nSTRASSER Don't worry, Jill.

Their DOG is WHINING at something from underneath their deck. \n(CONTINUED) \n109   CONTINUED:                                                         109 \nPOV SHOT - LOOKING THROUGH BACK YARD \nThe couple can see all the way down back.     Every fence has been knocked over. \nWe TRACK THROUGH the back yards, PAST overturned lawn furniture and downed clotheslines. People stepping out of the doors -- confused. \nBACK TO MAN \non cordless phone, surveying the damage. \nBOXER SHORTS MAN (into phone) Is this L.A. County Animal Control...? You're not gonna believe this... \n110   EXT. SEPULVEDA PASS - NIGHT                                        110 \nFIND Joe -- emerging from the thick growth. He can hear the NOISE like a rushing river O.S. He moves to the top of the crest. \nJOE'S POV - SAN DIEGO FREEWAY - NIGHT \nWhere the hills are split by the river of light.    Joe looks out over the freeway. \n111   EXT. NIGHT-SCAPE                                                   111 \nJoe can see the searchlights in the distance. \nThe rushing river of light is an image Joe can't quite assimilate. But somehow Joe knows he must cross this \"thing\" to get to the hills on the other side. \n112   EXT. FREEWAY - NIGHT                                               112 \nJoe steps into the first eight lanes of freeway traffic. \nWe hear some SCREECHING and SKIDDING as the first four drivers of the first four CARS in each northbound lane spot Joe and slam on the BRAKES. \nMiraculously, nobody crashes. Bumpers remain uncrushed. Almost ceremoniously, the oncoming traffic comes to a respectful halt as Joe hesitantly lumbers past. \n(CONTINUED) \n"}

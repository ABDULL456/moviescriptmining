JORDAN (V.O.) Even more ironic was he'd gotten himself indicted on charges that had nothing to fucking do with me.

ROCKY AOKI, Japanese, 50s, is led out in handcuffs by a MAN in an FBI windbreaker. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Something about laundering drug money through offshore boat racing and a guy named Rocky Aoki, the founder of Benihana.

A smiling Rocky Aoki looks on as a HIBACHI CHEF expertly dices shrimp on a sizzling grill. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Beni-fucking-hana! Why would God be so cruel as to choose a chain of fucking Hibachi Restaurants to bring me down?

Saurel lays on the bed, smoking. 
JORDAN (V.O.) Long story short was Saurel ratted me out, but not before he ratted out Chantalle, who it turns out he'd been fucking every time she went to Switzerland! 
Chantalle emerges from the bathroom naked.     Laughing, she runs and jumps in bed with Saurel.

Jordan exits the building. He's fucked and he knows it. He sees beautiful Naomi waiting for him beside a limosine; life isn't totally hopeless. He approaches. 
JORDAN Nay, thank God. I'm so glad you're here. 
They embrace. He can't see her expression: she'd rather be anywhere else.

226   EXT. JORDAN'S ESTATE - POOL AREA - DAY         (SEP `98)          226 
ON SKYLAR AND PARKER, playing with a NANNY and Rocky the dog. Jordan watches them, sitting by his pool, drinking an O'Douls, weighing his options. 
Donnie pops into the yard, in "Uncle Donnie" mode. 
DONNIE Hey, everybody! How're the happiest people in Long Island? Hi, Rocky!! (joining Jordan) Hate that fucking dog. 
JORDAN Tell me about it. It's getting old, starting to shit inside the house again. 
Jordan offers Donnie an O'Douls; Donnie declines. 
DONNIE How you doing, brother?     How was the food in jail? 
JORDAN Lobster Newburg sucked.     They gave me some jewelry though. 
He shows off the electronic bracelet around his ankle. 
DONNIE Wonder if they got one in my size. Fuckin' Rugrat, that wig-wearin' hump. Tell you one thing: I'm never eating at Benihana's again. Where's Naomi? 
JORDAN Inside.    Pissed. 
Donnie sees Naomi in a window.      He waves but she barely registers him. 
DONNIE What's up her ass? 
JORDAN Had to mortgage the home to make bail. Probably gonna hafta sell it to pay my lawyers. If we fight this thing. 
Donnie weighs that. The Wolf of Wall Street   Buff Revised Pages   3/5/13 
DONNIE The Feds say anything about coming after the rest of us? 
Jordan thinks, then shakes his head no.

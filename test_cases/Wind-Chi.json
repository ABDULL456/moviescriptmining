UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - DAY                              1 \nA GIRL'S FACE \nfills the screen, twenty-one years old, pensive, pretty. \nCamera lingers on her in CLOSE UP, noticing details: hair worn stylishly messy, no makeup, double-pierced ears (though no earrings today), the corner of her bottom lip a little frayed where she's been chewing it ruminatively. \nShe's the kind of beauty who can withstand such bad lighting: institutional lighting, florescents HUMMING overhead, joining the chorus of ambient noises: a COUGH, papers RUSTLING, the SCRIBBLE of a pen, someone SHIFTING in their chair, etc. The shot lingers until it becomes uncomfortable, invasive, scrutinizing this unhappy girl in an unguarded moment, then - \nA new sound breaks her reverie, a muted BUZZING o.s., and her eyes cut down to - \nHER CELLPHONE \nskittering sideways across the closed cover of her blue final exam book, like a bug. She has an INCOMING TEXT MESSAGE. \nWIDEN TO REVEAL: \n2   INT. UNIVERSITY LECTURE HALL - ESTABLISHING - DAY               2 \nOur GIRL is just one of two hundred other STUDENTS filling a big auditorium-style lecture hall. Around her, classmates sit grim-faced, scribbling to beat the clock. \nBACK TO: \nOUR GIRL traps the buzzing cellphone before it skitters right off the edge of the half-desk, looks at the display. \nINSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY - \nu done?! \nBACK TO SCENE \nOur girl leans back a little in her seat, gives a little nod to her friend seated across the lecture hall. Types a reply. \nINSERT CELLPHONE DISPLAY - \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                    2. 2    CONTINUED:                                                     2 \nyes \nINTERCUT: CELL PHONE DISPLAY / OUR GIRL \nShe looks down as her friend text-messages: \nhow r u getting home? Typing. \nbus She sends the message, a moment later the reply appears: \nsux 4 U She glances up, sees her friend shoot her a sympathetic look. \nPROCTOR (O.S.) That's it, people! Wrap it up! \nThere's a collective GROAN and the sound of two hundred panicked asses twisting in their seats. \nOur girl feels her phone buzz, looks down to see a final text message from her friend: \ny don't u check the ride board? A slow smile lights up her face at the idea, as all around her students rise and begin stampeding out. \nPROCTOR (O.S.) (cont'd) (shouting to be heard) Test results will be posted on the Philosophy Department's web site in two weeks... Enjoy your break and have a Happy New Year. \nShe gathers her things, begins to make her way down the stairs when - \nGIRL Hey! \n- she's JOSTLED from behind by a CLASSMATE bolting past her. \nShe hands in her exam book, waves to her friend, and exits. \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                    3. \n3   EXT. NEW ENGLAND UNIVERSITY - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY               3 \nCampus is a ghost town, most students having already left for the holidays: the DORMS abandoned, the LIBRARY STACKS empty, the LABS silent, the DINING HALLS eerie. \nOur GIRL hurries across the deserted college green dotted with little hillocks of snow from an earlier storm. She passes a forlorn pine tree decorated with CHRISTMAS LIGHTS, on her way to... \n4   EXT. UNIVERSITY - QUAD - DAY                                    4 \nShe arrives at a large, partially-enclosed KIOSK covered with dozens of student-made notices, printed in a rainbow of eye- catching computer fonts and colors. A sign at the top reads: RIDE BOARD. \nGIRL They use a laser. \nGUY Well, yeah, they do... But there's definitely peeling involved too. I saw it on Discovery Health. If more people knew about the peeling part they might think twice before going under the knife. \nGIRL Laser. \nGUY Right, laser. \nGIRL I'm having corrective eye surgery over the break. \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                     13. 13    CONTINUED: (2)                                                  13 \nGUY Oh. \nAn awkward beat. \nGIRL It's okay. I'm not really worried. \nGUY Why? \nGIRL I'm not worried? \nGUY You're getting it done... \nGIRL Because I hate wearing glasses. \nGUY But they look good on you. \nShe frowns. \nGIRL How do you know? I don't wear them outside my dorm. \nHe gets a cornered look. \nGUY You sure? You never... to class or anything? Because I could swear I- \nGIRL Never. \nGUY Huh. Weird. I wonder why I thought- \nHe breaks off, saved by the sight of a gas station up ahead. \nGUY (cont'd) Hey, look! Here's your gas station! \nShe looks at him across the dark front seat, suspicious. \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                    14. \n14   EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - NIGHT                                14 \nA florescent oasis in the gathering dark. A tow truck and several old wrecks rusting in the weeds surrounding it. \nThe Oldsmobile pulls off the highway and up to a gas pump. \n15   EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - GAS PUMP / OLDSMOBILE - MINUTES      15 LATER \nHe starts the pump.   Notices her still seated in the car. \nHe knocks on her window.    She opens the door. \nGUY I thought you had to pee? \nGIRL I didn't expect us to find a bathroom so soon. My nails aren't dry. \nGUY Oh. \nHe looks over the roof of the car, sizing up the distance across the slushy parking lot. \nGUY (cont'd) Well if you want, I can carry you. \nGIRL That's okay, they'll be dry in just a second. \nGUY Come on, I'm good at this... \nGIRL You are not carrying me inside. \nHe opens her door, pulls her legs around, and crouches down between them. \nGUY Hold on. \nGIRL What are you doing?! Wait - \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                   15. 15    CONTINUED:                                                    15 \nAT THE COUNTER: \nShe strides up as the guy pays for the gas and a couple bottles of water. \nGIRL Didn't you hear me banging in there? \nGUY (startled; puzzled smile) When? \nGIRL You think it's funny? Me locked in? \nGUY Locked in where? \nGIRL You're telling me you didn't just hear me banging on the door? \nGUY I don't know what you're- \nGIRL (cuts him off) Forget it. Let's just get on the road. \nHe gathers up the bottled water, heads toward the door.    The clerk calls to him: \nCLERK Remember, highway's your best bet- \nGUY (dismissive) Don't worry about it man, I got it all covered. \nShe frowns, following him to the exit. \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                  18. 18    CONTINUED:                                                   18 \nGIRL Are we lost or something? \nGUY (quickly) No, I've made this drive a million times. \nHe holds the door for her, then follows her outside. \n19   EXT. PENN-WAY QUICK MART - CONTINUOUS                         19 \nAs they exit and start toward the car she offers him a twenty. He looks at the money, as if he's never seen U.S. currency before. \nGUY What's that for? \nGIRL My half of the gas. \nGUY Keep it. \nGIRL What do you mean? Isn't that how ride-sharing works? -- We split everything fifty-fifty? \nGUY I don't take money from friends. \nSince when are they friends? \nThey separate, walking around to their respective sides of the car. She tries the passenger door handle, only to find it stuck. \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                     19. 19    CONTINUED:                                                      19 \nShe rolls her eyes, waits for him to open it from the inside. \n20   OMITTED                                                          20 \n21   INT.

Which wouldn't be cause for alarm or even interest except- \nHe suddenly turns the wheel sharply, taking the exit. \n22   EXT. OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT                                    22 \nThe car veers off the interstate onto a much smaller two-lane road marked with a simple sign, paint-on-wood, faded to illegibility: Scenic Route 606. \nThe tires crunch across an old chain which had once prevented access to the road but is now half-buried in the snow. \nAttached to it is a diamond-shaped warning sign of a more modern vintage reading: Rough Road. \n23   INT. OLDSMOBILE - THAT MOMENT                                    23 \nShe falls against him, bracing herself against the dash. \nGIRL What the hell are you doing!? \nGUY Scenic detour. \nGUY I'm exactly who I said I was, am, it's just- \nGIRL What the hell's going on here? \nGUY Nothing's going on- \nGIRL WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE!? \nGUY Look, just calm down.

ROUTE 606 - THAT MOMENT                                    26 \nFrom a high angle overlooking the road we watch the two cars racing toward one another, headed on a collision course. \n27   INT. OLDSMOBILE - AS BEFORE                                     27 \nFor the time being their fight has taken a back seat to the oncoming car playing chicken with them. \nGIRL Pull over and let this asshole by. \nGUY Over where? There's no shoulder. \nHe's right. On the passenger side the road abuts a steep wooded hillside. Opposite that it drops off into a ravine. \nThey are both too distracted by the ONCOMING HEADLIGHTS to notice the Christmas SONG that's just come on the RADIO: Brenda Lee's 1958 hit \"Rockin' Around the Christmas Tree.\" \nBRENDA LEE Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, at the Christ-mas par-ty hop... \n28   EXT.

Skid off the road and SLAM into a snowbank with a bone-shuddering CRASH. \nBRENDA LEE Rockin' around, the Christmas tree, Have a happy hol-i-day. Everyone's dancing mer-ri-ly in the New. Old.

STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - NIGHT                                 32 \nThe Oldsmobile has ended up on the opposite roadside facing the wrong way, its driver's side jammed into a snowbank. \nGUY Asshole who ran us off the road. \nShe's completely forgotten all about the other vehicle until now. She turns to look, puzzled. \nThere's no sign of the other vehicle anywhere. They're alone. \nGIRL I don't know. I guess maybe he decided just to hit and run. \nGUY So where are his tire tracks? \nShe looks, sees an unbroken expanse of fresh white snow. \nGIRL In case you haven't noticed, it's coming down pretty hard. \nGUY (points) Yeah, but you can still see our tracks. \nThe mystery of the missing tracks seems to have penetrated his post-accident fog, bringing him back into sharper focus. \nShe watches as he walks out in front of the Olds' headlights to the middle of the road, where the other vehicles track's should be. \nGUY (cont'd) What the hell?! \nHe walks back to the Olds and opens the passenger door (the only access into or out of the stranded car, thanks to the snowbank). He begins searching the glove compartment for a flashlight. \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                     28. 34    CONTINUED: (3)                                                  34 \nANGLE ON HER \nDeliberating whether to seize this moment of distraction to make a break for it. \nShe looks back down the long dark road. \nLooks back at him bent over rummaging in the Oldsmobile. \nToo risky. \nCuriosity getting the better of her, she walks out to the middle of the road to have a look for herself. \nNo tracks. \nJust an expanse of fresh powder and a few of his footprints. \nGIRL (to herself) This doesn't make any sense... \nAt that moment he emerges from the car with a flashlight. He spokes it, sweeps the strong beam over their surroundings. \nThe left side of the road falls off into a darkness so deep even the flashlight's beam can't penetrate it. A precipice. \nHe cups his hand and calls out at the top of his lungs. \nGUY (calling) HELLO! \nShe jumps at the sound of his voice, her nerves frazzled. \nGUY (cont'd) (calling) ANYBODY OUT THERE!? ANYONE?! HEY! \nHis voice is swallowed by the dark. After the echoes subside the only sound in the hush is the SIZZLE of falling snow and a weird otherworldly HUM. \nHe snaps off his flashlight, thrusts it into his coat pocket. \nGIRL What now? \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                     29. 34    CONTINUED: (4)                                                  34 \nGUY I guess we see how bad we're stuck. \nThey trudge back to the car, boots crunching in the snow. \nGUY (cont'd) You steer, I'll push. \nHe holds the passenger door for her while she scrambles in, scooting over into the driver's seat. He leaves the door open so they can communicate. \nHe walks back to the rear of the stranded Oldsmobile. \nHe's pulling on gloves when something half-buried in the snow nearby catches his eye. He takes out the flashlight, shines it at the roadside. \nLittle wooden crosses. \nJust two this time. Another sad shrine, to a different set of anonymous victims of Route 606. \nTheir proximity to the stranded Olds obviously unsettles him. \nGIRL (calling) Ready? \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                  32. 36    CONTINUED: (2)                                               36 GUY (cont'd) accident! You saw the other car. You think he was in on it, too? \nGIRL (raving) Maybe! Maybe he's like your Black Pete or something! Why the hell did you tell me that story anyway? \nGUY You're crazy... \nGIRL (lying) Anyway, I've got news for you... I got through to a friend's voicemail while you were supposedly unconscious. I'm sure she's called the cops by now. \nGUY Would you listen to yourself? What kind of psycho do you think I am? \nGIRL Exactly. \nHe straightens, exasperated, puts a hand to his injured head. \nShe looks at him standing there, hugging himself against the sub-zero cold, his teeth chattering. He doesn't look like an ax-murderer. \nShe doesn't know what to do. There's a long beat. Finally, he throws up his hands in disgust, decides to go to Plan B. \nGUY I'm gonna walk back to the gas station for help. You've got the heater and the radio, so you should be all right here. Though I really think you should consider coming with me. \nGIRL I bet you do. \nGUY (pissed) Fine. Whatever.

I keep duct tape in the back. \nGIRL (sarcastic) I bet you do. \nHe looks in at her one last time, exits. \nShe listens to the crunch of his footsteps until she can't hear them anymore. \nSuddenly there's a loud BANG against the passenger side window. She jumps. \nGUY BUT IT'S MY CAR!! \nHe goes crazy on the stranded Olds: punching the roof, jerking the door handle, kicking the door, screaming at her the whole time. \nShe cowers inside, scared to death. \nFinally he gives up, and with a final BANG to the roof, exits. \nHe turns and heads back down the road. \nWe watch through the rear window as he trudges robotically away, his boots crunch-crunch-crunching in the snow. \nHe stops.   Leans his weight against a tree.    Looks back at the car. \nWhatever it is he's doing, he's clearly not walking to the gas station. \nHe straightens, and continues on until he's out of sight. \n37   EXT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE / ROADSIDE - NIGHT                      37 \nThe stranded Oldsmobile sits on the roadside, engine running, hood and windshield covered in white.

Despite the heater it's cold enough in the car (thanks to the gap in the window) to see her breath. \nA PUBLIC SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENT plays on the car's radio. \nRADIO PSA ... The National Weather Service has issued a Winter Storm Warning for the entire Eastern Seaboard... Boxer shorts. Socks. Box of condoms. A copy of the Tibetan Book of the Dead. A cheap Radio Shack TELEPHONE wrapped in its cord. A CROW BAR, which she tosses up to the front seat. \nRADIO PSA (cont'd) ... Carbon County residents can expect snow accumulations of four to six inches... Suddenly we see - \nA BLUR OF MOVEMENT outside the car's foggy REAR WINDOW... \nBut she's too busy searching through the junk in the back seat to notice. \nFinally she finds what she's looking for: silver DUCT TAPE. \nAlso a PAIR OF SCISSORS. \nShe holds the scissors like a dagger, clearly thinking they could come in useful if she needs to defend herself. \nShe climbs up front, rips off a three-foot length of tape. \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                     37. 39    CONTINUED: (2)                                                  39 \nGIRL I don't know, it was weird. I saw some guy walking down the road. \nGUY Where did he go? \nGIRL I don't know. Into the woods. \nHer eyes keep cutting back and forth between him and the woods where the stranger disappeared, as if not sure which is the greater threat. \nGUY Look. It's freezing out here. Let's just get in the car and you can tell me what happened... \nGIRL (paranoid) What are you doing back so soon? What about hiking to the gas station? \nGUY It was closed. I was going to leave a note, but I didn't... You know. Have anything to write with. \nShe clutches the scissors tighter, not believing a word. \nGIRL But those places are supposed to stay open 24/7! Why wasn't it open? \nGUY How the hell should I know?! Independent operator. Look, can we continue this conversation in the car, `cause I'm freezing my balls off standing out here. \nGIRL (shrieks) I'm not getting into the car with you, you psycho!!! \nHe closes his eyes and shakes his head, beyond frustrated. \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                     38. 39    CONTINUED: (3)                                                  39 \nGUY Fine. Whatever. I'm getting in. You're welcome to join me. \nHe turns and trudges back to the Oldsmobile, climbs in, and pulls the door shut after him. Leaving her there in the snowy road, clutching the scissors, her teeth chattering. \nShe stands there, shivering, looking very small and alone. \nHOLD on her as she weighs her options: stay out here and freeze. Or risk seeking shelter with a stalker. \nNot much of a choice. \n40   INT. STRANDED OLDSMOBILE - MOMENTS LATER                         40 \nHe looks over as the door wrenches open and she climbs in. \nShe pulls the door shut behind her, then huddles against it. Eyeing him warily. \nHe starts to reach toward her and she brandishes the scissors- \nGUY Relax. \n- and switches off the overhead interior lights, explaining: \nGUY (cont'd) We need to conserve the battery. \nWith the interior light off the car fills with an otherwordly blue glow reflected off the snow. She pulls her knees up as if trying to make herself as small as she can, to position herself as far away from him as is humanly possible on a bench seat. \nHer eyes cut to the DASHBOARD CLOCK.    She frowns. \nGIRL That's not right. The clock... \nGUY (checks watch) Huh? No, it's not. It should read... \nHe frowns, looking down at his watch.

Oh well... Guess we'll just have to rely on my precisely calibrated body clock. \nHe tosses his useless watch over his shoulder into the back seat. \nSuddenly she notices a trickle of blood coming from his head. \nGIRL Hey. \nGUY What? \nGIRL You're bleeding. \nHe touches two fingers to the left side of his head. They come away bloody. As he lifts his watch cap we see the left side of his head is matted with frozen blood, now beginning to melt. The collar of his coat is soaked with it. \nGUY It's nothing... \nGIRL It doesn't look like nothing. \nGUY Okay, you've made your point! I'm a creep who gets off on chauffeuring women under false pretenses. Can we drop this already? (changing subject) Christ. I'm starving. You hungry? \nHe leans over the seatback, begins rummaging in the back. \nGUY (cont'd) Did you see a bag of groceries in the trunk? \nAt mention of groceries she temporarily drops the topic of the gas station. Remembers: \nGIRL No. Oh, shit. I think I might've left it in the parking lot. \nGUY What?! \nGIRL I'm sorry. It was an accident- \nGUY Shit! I spent sixty bucks on this gourmet crap you like! Saint Andre's cheese and Carr's crackers and those stupid little French pickles, I forget what they're called- \nGIRL (quietly) Cornichons...

Who did this to you?! \nSTRANGER ...please, officer, just take the booze and let me go... \nShe reaches toward him. \nThe instant her hand nears him the wind HOWLS DEAFENINGLY.

How do you know it's not a trick! He could still be out there waiting- \nGUY He's not! Listen! \nThey sit in silence, listening, but hear only the wind. \nGIRL But what if he comes back..? \nGUY We just have to stay in the car until morning. Then we'll be safe. That can't be more than, like, a few more hours... Someone's bound to come along once the sun comes up... Someone human I mean. Think you can hold on until then? \nGIRL (shy) What if, you know. We have to pee? \nGUY We can use the empty water bottles. From this point on, the back seat is a co-ed bathroom. Sound like a plan? \nSounds like a plan. \nGUY (cont'd) Why don't you try to get some sleep? I'll take the next watch. \nShe shakes her head, eyes full of fear. \n(CONTINUED) \nWIND CHILL - Yellow Revisions 2/23/05                    75. 67    CONTINUED: (3)                                                 67 \nGIRL I don't want to sleep. \nHe nods, understanding. \nSo they just hunker down in the front seat, staring at the snow covered windshield, and start the long wait to morning. \n", "test3_true": "4:58 A.M. \n68   EXT.

It's hard enough doing this in front of you. \nGUY What, are you one of those people who can't pee with the bathroom door open? \nGIRL No. But it's not something I usually do until much later in a relationship... \nShe catches herself at the last second, but it's too late: the word \"relationship\" hangs in the air.

Is this blood? \nNo answer. \nGIRL (cont'd) How badly were you hurt in the crash? \nGUY (shrugs) No big deal. Just your average day in the NHL... \nBut she sees through his tough-guy facade.

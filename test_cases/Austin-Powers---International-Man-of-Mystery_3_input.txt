AUSTIN I'm spent.  What say you we go out on the town? 
EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - BUS - NIGHT 
Austin and Vanessa are on the top deck of an open air double- decker English bus having a full-course formal dinner. They're drinking champagne. 
Austin is cutting sausages into ever-smaller pieces, holding his cutlery very English.  He has cut one piece to the point to which it's a speck.  H puts it on the fork and offers it to her. 
AUSTIN Fancy a nibble? 
VANESSA I couldn't have another bite. 
They laugh.  They drink.  It's TOM JONES, serenading them. 
They begin to dance. 
Austin gives her roses.  Austin is wooing her. 
EXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT 
They walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying each other's company.  Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock.  She graciously accepts. 
64  LAS VEGAS - SUPERIMPOSITION MONTAGE 
Austin and Vanessa stroll against a changing series of backgrounds&emdash neon signs, Vegas icons, dice showgirls, etc. 
INT.  HOTEL ROOM 
Sounds of MOANS and GROANS.  We see Austin's backside sticking out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled leg straining upwards. 
VANESSA (O.S.) Watch out, you're on my hair! 
AUSTIN (O.S.) Sorry.  Move your hand to the left. There you go.  Gorgeous. 
VANESSA (O.S.) Go!  Just go! 
We hear a SPINNING SOUND. 
AUSTIN (O.S.) Left hand, blue. 
We now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing TWISTER.  She reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing. 
AUSTIN Wait a tick, I forgot something in the lobby. (moving behind the couch) I know what.  I'll take the stairs. 
Behind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs. 
AUSTIN Maybe I'll take the escalator. 
Austin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator. 
AUSTIN Why take the escalator when I could take a canoe? 
Austin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch. 
VANESSA I haven't had fun like that since college. 
AUSTIN I'm sorry. 
VANESSA Why? 
AUSTIN I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die. 
She laughs too much, making a SNORTING sound. 
VANESSA Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell. 
AUSTIN No, this is me in a nutshell. 
Austin mimes being trapped in a nutshell. 
AUSTIN Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind of nut has such a big nutshell?  How did I get into this bloody great big nutshell? 
Vanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy.

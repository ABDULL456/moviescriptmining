DR. HASSIEM Dr. Jansen and I didn't disagree on the facts. After all we examined the same body in the same time. But just on the interpretation. For example, if Gordon, had really been hanged, the marks on his throat would have been concentrated on the front. (he touches his larynx) But in this case, the bruises were more obvious on the sides. Pause.   Ben nods, silent. DR. HASSIEM Something else really upset me, perhaps it isn't important. BEN What was it? 
Dr. Hassiem puts down his daughter. DR. HASSIEM (leaning forward) You see, through a misunderstanding I arrived at the morgue too early for the autopsy. There wasn't a soul around except a young African attendant. When I told him I'd come for the autopsy, he let me in. The body was on the table dressed. I noticed blood on the clothes. 
BEN And then? 
DR. HASSIEM As I examined the clothes more closely, a police-officer came in and said I wasn't allowed in the morgue before Dr. Jansen arrived. When I returned with Dr. Jansen, half an hour later, the body was naked. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: BEN (excited) Doctor, we've already got the African attendant's affidavit. He testified that Capt. Stolz ordered him to burn the clothes. (pause) Did you mention what you said in your report? DR. HASSIEM Of course.   I found it most odd. BEN Doctor Hassiem would you be prepared to put that in writing? 
Dr. Hassiem thinks it over for a while then: DR. HASSIEM Please excuse me for a minute. Ben watches him leave the room, the little girl following him. He gets up from the chair, walks to the window, glances through it, then steps to look at some family photographs on the mantlepiece. Amongst them a photograph of Dr. Hassiem before "Big Ben." Dr. Hassiem returns with a file, the daughter still following. 
DR. HASSIEM (opening the file) This is my report. I only have one copy. 
BEN (astounded) You have a copy of the report? 
Hassiem grins. DR. HASSIEM I know how to hide things from the S.B., Mr. Du Toit. Ben congratulates him by a deep laughter. 
CUT TO: INT. HASSIEM'S OFFICE - DAY 
Ben and Dr. Hassiem working as a team, tape the type- written sheets of the report among a Rand Daily Mail newspaper pages at the back. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: On Dr. Hassiem's desk we recognize next to the phone, the little girl's photograph. 
DR. HASSIEM I hope you have as secure a place as I have. 
BEN (with an accomplice smile) I think so. 
INT. BUILDING IN CONSTRUCTION - LATE AFTERNOON A multi-storied building half-built. Stanley standing on the fourth floor watching Ben's arrival. 
Ben searches for Stanley who draws Ben's attention; beckons him up. Ben indicates they meet halfway. He joins Stanley who's sitting on a pile of bricks. STANLEY (with expansive gesture) Take a pew, man. BEN (sitting and excited) We have it, Stanley! STANLEY Have what? BEN Hassiem's report. You know what that means, Stanley? Melanie arrives in two days. We'll have all the evidence. Everything is in place. We'll get them yet, especially Stolz. STANLEY That's fantastic, man. 
Stanley produces from his jacket pocket a newspaper -- Rand Daily Mail. He opens it on a certain page with the picture of an African in police uniform, and hands it to Ben. 
BEN (shocked) God!   It's Johnson Seroke. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: STANLEY Late at night. A knock on the door. He opened and five shots, point-blank range. Face, chest, stomach. 
BEN (reading) 'A police spokesman when questioned said: "It's not the first time that a black member of the police has lost his life in the service of his country, fighting terrorism." (folding paper in disgust) Bloody bastards! They killed him. Stolz must have thought he knew too much. STANLEY What's the score? The nurse is detained; the mortuary attendant has disappeared; the police van driver who brought Jonathan to hospital is detained. Julius is in jail, and now Johnson dead. BEN Who's next on their secret list, I wonder? How much longer must the list grow of those who pay the price of our efforts to clear Gordon's name. 
STANLEY Hey! Are you going soft, Lanie? We must keep going even more so now. And for every bloke who's going to die of bloody natural causes in their hands. And for our children's future. 
BEN I know. If I can no longer believe that right is on my side, if I can no longer believe in imperative to go on, what will become of me, Stanley? Ben looks at Johnson's picture again and shakes his head. 
INT. BEN'S STUDY - DAY A 8x10 black and white photograph on Ben's desk. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: On the photograph a naked man and a girl on a bed and a bedside lamp on its side. The man is Ben and the girl is Melanie. Stolz in sports jacket, standing next to the desk is speaking... patronizing. 
STOLZ We're all made of flesh and blood, Mr. Du Toit -- we've all got our flaws. And if a man likes to sample the grass on the other side of the fence, well, that's his own business. But it would be unpleasant if people found out about it, especially if he's a teacher. BEN You mean, if I cooperate, if I stop digging, embarrassing you, threatening you... these photographs will disappear. 
STOLZ Let's just say I may be able to use my influence to make sure that a private indiscretion isn't used against you. BEN Suppose I refuse? Stolz looks past Ben. STOLZ Is this your son? 
Ben whirls around to see Johan at the door. He shoots, puts himself between the photograph and his son obviously surprised to find Capt. Stolz there. 
BEN Johan, leave us alone, please.

ELDRIDGE SIR-- 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES (cutting him off) Go downstairs, grab a farmer or one of those street vendors and procure - meaning purchase, buy - several donkeys. Then tow this car bomb away from my office. 
ELDRIDGE (STEELING HIMSELF) Sir, I'm going to need you to step away from the window. 
Geddes looks out the window at the burning car. 
SANBORN 
His walkie barks to life. 
JAMES O.S. (over Sanborn's walkie) Lot of pink Det cord here. 
SANBORN (INTO TALKIE) Where's the switch? 
JAMES 
JAMES (HEADSET) Not in the back seat. 
James is now in the front seat, tearing up the upholstery. 
JAMES CONT'D (HEADSET) Not in the front seat. Doors. Dash. 
A WISP of smoke curls out of the heating vents. James doesn't notice. 
SANBORN O.S. (WALKIE-TALKIE) If you haven't found it yet, it's probably under the car. 
JAMES (HEADSET) None of the cord goes under. It's up here -- somewhere. 
SANBORN O.S. (WALKIE-TALKIE) Try the weather-stripping. 
James rips off a chunk of weather stripping. Just bare metal. 
SANBORN 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) It's been thirty seconds. You need to bail. 
JAMES O.S. (WALKIE-TALKIE) I can find it. 
JAMES 
He crawls to the back seat, slipping on the foam and slime. More smoke escapes from the vents. 
SANBORN O.S. (WALKIE-TALKIE) James, seriously, you need to bail. 
JAMES (HEADSET) Roger that. Be right out. 
James retraces what's left of the wire, yet again, ignoring Sanborn. He sits back in the seat, strangely relaxed. 
EXT. ALLEY 
A shadow comes into Sanborn's sight. It's an IRAQI on a bicycle, riding straight towards him. 
ELDRIDGE O.S. (WALKIE-TALKIE) Incoming. 
Sanborn raises his rifle. The man peddles on, waving his hand. 
BICYCLIST (IN ARABIC) Where is the entrance to this building? 
SANBORN Imshee! Imshee! 
The bicyclist looks at the car. 
ELDRIDGE 
Trains his scope on the head of the bicyclist. 
ELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) I'm going to burn him on three. One. 
Geddes just looks at the big man at the window. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Oh, that's rich. Give him a count. 
Through Eldridge's scope the bicyclist grows.     He flicks off his safety. 
ELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) Blaster Mike, do you copy? (TO HIMSELF) ) Please don't make me kill you. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Been in combat very long? 
SANBORN 
SANBORN (into walkie to Eldridge) Copy that. (TO JAMES) James, you need to get out. There's another potential bomber here. 
BACK TO JAMES 
JAMES (TO SANBORN) So shoot him. 
BACK TO SANBORN 
BICYCLIST (IN ARABIC) I need to make a delivery down there. Please let me through. 
AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE 
ELDRIDGE O.S. (INTO WALKIE) Two!! 
SANBORN

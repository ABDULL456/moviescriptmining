MALKOVICH They love me, darling! "Craig Schwartz is fantastic!"  The New York Times. "If only Craig Schwartz had always been inside Malkovich!"  Women's Wear Daily. "Craig Schwartz - The world's greatest puppeteer!"  Paul Wunder, WBAI Radio. 
MAXINE Oh, darling. It's a dream come true. We're going to ride this straight to the top. 
MALKOVICH Sleepy suddenly. 
MAXINE Busy day, my little fire chief. Why don't you climb into bed, and I'll meet you there in just... 
But Malkovich is already passed out on the floor on top of his clippings. Maxine smiles maternally, gets up and puts blanket over him. We stay on Malkovich's face. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. HELL - NIGHT 
Craig wanders across a jagged, rocky landscape. Geysers of flame shoot up around him. The sky is red. He is frightened. He arrives at a desk. The man behind the desk is facing away from him. He swivels to face Craig. It is Flemmer, looking the same as usual except for little red horns and a sinister grin. 
CRAIG Who are you? 
FLEMMER I am the Devil. 
CRAIG Oh. 
FLEMMER Leave Malkovich. He is mine. 
CRAIG Okay. Sorry. I didn't know. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL SUITE - CONTINUOUS 
Malkovich awakes with a start. Maxine looks over at him. 
MAXINE Bad dream, darling? 
MALKOVICH I've got to leave Malkovich. 
MAXINE You've got to be kidding. 
MALKOVICH I just had the most horrifying nightmare. The devil was in it. 
Flemmer crouches behind a bureau and listens. He is pleased with himself. 
MAXINE Malkovich is our meal ticket. You can't back out because of some stupid dream. 
FLEMMER (to himself) Shit. 
MALKOVICH Honey, we can be happy and poor together. 
MAXINE (laughs derisively) Perhaps you'll want to consult that Ouija board again. 
There is a knock at the door. Maxine opens it, angry. 
MAXINE (CONT'D) Yeah what?! 
MALKOVICH Derek Mantini! 
Mantini enters. Maxine is suddenly interested. Mantini and Maxine give each other the once over. 
MANTINI (still eyeing Maxine) Hello, Schwartz. I saw your show. 
MALKOVICH Did you see the reviews? 
MANTINI Yeah, I saw them 
MALKOVICH Because if you missed any, I just happen to have copies here you can take with you when you leave now. 
MAXINE I'm Maxine. I produced the evening with Malkovich. 
MANTINI Very impressive. I could use a producer with your vision. And other outstanding attributes. 
MALKOVICH She's not available. 
MANTINI We'll see, Schwartz. We'll see. 
MAXINE Yeah, we'll see, Schwartz. We'll see. 
MANTINI I won't waste your time Schwartz, or more importantly, mine. Here's my proposal: There's only room in this world for one "World's Greatest Puppeteer."  Correct? So let's allow the puppet-going public to crown their king. 
MALKOVICH How do we do that?

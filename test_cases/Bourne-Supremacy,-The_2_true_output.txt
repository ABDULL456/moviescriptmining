253       EXT. CATHEDRAL PLAZA -- NIGHT                             253 
Very late -- ABBOTT waits on an isolated bridge -- a lone        * figure in the shadow of East Berlin.                             * 
GRETKOV arrives by car. Walks through the darkness.              * ABBOTT barely glancing over.                                     * 
ABBOTT You told me Bourne was dead. 
GRETKOV There was a mistake. 
ABBOTT I'l   l say. You killed his goddam                             * gir   lfriend instead. Now they're onto                        * Nes   ki. They're at the Brecker Hotel even                    * as    we speak.                                                * 
GRETKOV Will it track back to us?                                      * 
ABBOTT No. The files are spotless. Whatever                           * they find, it's just going to make Conklin                     * look worse.                                                    * 
GRETKOV And the Landy woman?                                           * 
ABBOTT She's done everything I wanted. She bit                        * on Conklin so fast it was laughable. She                       * even found his bogus Swiss account...                          * 
GRETKOV                                            * Anything else?                                                 * 
ABBOTT shoves a piece of paper -- and ADDRESS -- into                    * GRETKOV'S hand.                                                          * 
ABBOTT (the p   aper)                                        * The   re's a bo   dy in the basem   ent. Dann    y Zor   n. He's     got to disappea   r. For go    od. Cle   an and fa   st. I'll put h    im in bed    with Con   klin and    Bourne. Even t    he girl, N   icky.         * Giv   e me twen   ty-four hours,    I'll think    it up.     But get    the goddamn bo   dy out of the   re. 
It's getting late.    A taxi now and then...                             * 
ABBOTT (CONT'D) Neski was a roadblock. Without me,                             * there's no company, no fortune. You owe                        * me, Uri. One last push.                                        * 
GRETKOV One last push. One. 
GRETKOV leaves.   ABBOTT watches him go.                           * 
254    EXT. MERCEDES -- NIGHT                                       254

KIRILL slouched in back.    Waiting.   Gretkov to the DRIVER. 
GRETKOV (Airport.) (to Kirill) (We're done here.) 
KIRILL nods. As they pull away, ABBOTT turns and walks             * into the foggy night...                                            * 
A248   EXT. BERLIN STREET -- NIGHT                                 A248   * 
Late. ABBOTT walks.      A lonely figure.    Past someone in       * the shadows --                                                     * 
BOURNE                                    * Mr. Abbott?                                              * 
He turns to answer when BOURNE firmly guides him into a            * side street...                                                     * 
***BOURNE/ABBOTT SCENE***                                          *

TEDDY Here's what    I've got. (reads   ) Remember Vla   dimir Neski? R    ussian                  * politician?

PAMELA                                    * By who?                                                  * 
TEDDY His wife. In room 645. Then she shot                     * herself.                                                 * (Pamela and Cronin share a                         * look)                                             * 
PAMELA                                       * (to Teddy)                                         * Alright...I want you, Kurt and Kim to stay on            * Bourne, track everything that's out                      * there...                                                 * 
TEDDY goes to get in the van.    PAMELA follows with               * CRONIN.                                                            *

As they get in...                                                  * 
PAMELA (CONT'D)                              * -- they have to be related.                              *

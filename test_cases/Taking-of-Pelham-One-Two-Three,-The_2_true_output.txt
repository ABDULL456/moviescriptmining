EXT. SQUAD CAR 
as it pulls a U-turn in the middle of the block (Broadway), tires squealing, barely avoiding a bus. The time is 
SUPERIMPOSED: 
INTO TUNNEL Blue, Green, Brown and Grey. 
BLUE Check handguns in coat pocket -- 
CONTINUED They each remove a snub-nosed pistol, check it, then return it. 
BLUE Remove magazines from submachine guns. All of them pick up their submachine guns but only three remove the magazines and then place the guns back dcwn again. Grey merely watches the other three,. continuing to hold his gun under his arm, a slight smile on his face. 
BLUE Did you hear me, Mr. Grey? Disarm your gun and put it down so we can I get out of here. 
GREY I'm not leaving it -- it goes out with me. 
BLUE Put it down, Mr. Grey -- 
GREY What if something's gone wrong? What if they're waiting for us up there? I want more'n just a dinky pea-shooter! 
BLUE Nothing's gone wrong. The plan depends on our walking away un- noticed. You can't do that carry- ing a submachine gun. 
GREY I won't just carry it -- I'll hold it under my coat -- 
GREEN This is crazy! Do what he says so we can get going! 
BLUE You're leaving your gun here, Mr. 
GREY -- 
GREY 
(SMILES INSOLENTLY) In a pig's ass, Mr. Blue -- 
CONTINUED - 2 Without any warning, Blue, whose Wright hand has been in his pocket, fires his pistol through his coat, catching f Grey full in the chest. He staggers back, bumps against the tunnel wall and collapses, landing on his side. Blue bends, pries the submachine gun 'Loose from Grey's death grip, removes the magazine, pockets it, and tosses the gun away. Green has watched all this in near panic. 
GREEN Oh my God -- Brown watches with a detachment bordering on disinterest. 
BROWN I What about his money vest? 
BLUE Mr. Green will put it on over his own. 
GREEN Me? Why me? 
BLUE You're the thinnest one -- it'll show less. Hurry up and undress. Mr. Brown -- help me with Mr. Grey. They start to work on the dead body as Green starts undressing.

INT. FIRST CAR 
Some of the Passengers have gone to the front of the car. The W.A.S.P. is trying to open the door to the Motorman's cab, but there's no outside handle so all he can do is pound impotently against it. The Mother remains in her seat holding her two boys pressed against her. Now the Old Man starts pushing his way up front. 
OLD MAN My friends -- please -- the situa- tion isn't as lousy as it looks -- 
FAG Just a little lousy's good enough for me. 
W.A.S.P. I never knew these things went so fast. 
MOTHER We're going to be killedl 
OLD MAN No -- no we won't! I admit that right now we're on a run-away train, but it's only temporary -- The car careens into a curve and sways wildly as the metal wheels scrape and screech. There's a good deal of scream- ing and shouting from the Passengers as several fall down. The Old Man starts to topple but the Pimp steadies him. 
OLD ILXN Thank you, brother. 
W.A.S.P. Ahelluva lot you know -- 
OLD MAN But I do know -- I've been riding the subways for over sixty years -- I'm an expert! 
HOOKER Why don't we cut all this crap and beat down that goddam door, for 
CHRISSAKEL 
OLD.MAN It isn't necessary! They got something called stoppers or trippers or stickers or something

CONTINUED OLD MAN (Contd) like that -- so whenever a train goes through a red light these things automatically stop it. 
PIMP (looking cut the 
FRONT WINDOW) There's jest one thing, baby -- 
OLD MAN

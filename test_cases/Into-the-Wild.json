{"train": "INTO THE WILD \nWritten by \nSean Penn \nBased on the book by \nJon Krakauer \n1   EXT. THE STAMPEDE TRAIL - DAY                                    1 \nSUPER: Tuesday, April 28th 1992 \nWIDE-SHOT: A vast, snow-blanketed wilderness that sits beneath the icy summits of the highest mountain range in North America. This is BIG Alaska. \nA beat up 4x4 pick-up enters very small into the upper left corner of frame on an unkept, snow-packed road, and comes to a stop. A figure exits the passenger side and moves around the front of the truck. We can just make out the rifle sticking out of his backpack. We HEAR a very distant \"Thank You\" as the figure walks away from the road and away from the truck, seemingly into nowhere. \nDRIVER Hey! \nThe figure with backpack and rifle, henceforth BACKPACK, stopping in his tracks, turns around in the direction of the truck. \nDRIVER (CONT'D) Come here. \nBACKPACK walks back to the truck.    As he approaches the driver's door, we \nCUT IN TO: TIGHT SHOT over the back-packed shoulder onto the DRIVER. \nDRIVER (CONT'D) (referring to items we see sitting on dashboard) You left your watch, your comb, your change... \nWe STAY on the DRIVER as BACKPACK speaks: \nBACKPACK Keep it. \nDRIVER I don't want your money.    And I already have a watch. \nBACKPACK If you don't take it, I'm gonna throw it away. I don't want to know what time it is, what day it is, or where I am. (MORE) \nBACKPACK (CONT'D) I don't want to see anybody. None of that matters. \nThe driver reaches behind the seat of the truck, pulls out an old pair of rubber work boots. \nDRIVER (handing him the boots) Take em. \nThere is a pause as Backpack considers accepting the boots. \nDRIVER (CONT'D) If you make it out alive, give me a call, and I'll tell you how to get the boots back to me. \nWe can feel over Backpack's shoulder that he has taken the boots and is putting them on but we STAY on the driver. \nBACKPACK Hey, do me a favor, will ya?     Take a picture of me. \nBackpack hands him an Instamatic camera and starts walking backwards. We PULL BACK with him. And he maintains his back to us. When he stops, we CONTINUE until he is FULL-FRAME, head-to-toe from behind, posing. \nCUT TO: \nCU: driver \nCLICK.   He snaps the shot. Backpack re-enters frame in an OVER-SHOULDER.          Driver hands him the camera. \nDRIVER You gonna be alright? \nBACKPACK I'll be better than that. (I'll be who I am.) \nAs Backpack exits the frame, we SLOWLY ZOOM past the concerned face of the driver onto the loose change, the comb, and the watch on the dash. \nThroughout the ZOOM, the SOUND of FOOTSTEPS CRUNCHING THE SNOW, FADE into the distance. \nBACK TO: \nORIGINAL WIDE-SHOT: \nWe see the small form of the truck and the smaller form of the Backpacker walking away from the truck until the Backpacker has exited the frame. The truck takes a BEAT, turns around in the snow, and accelerates back into the direction from which it came. As the truck exits frame, we - \nDISSOLVE TO: \n2   EXT. COMMENCEMENT GROUNDS, EMORY UNIVERSITY, ATLANTA -         2 DAY \nSUPER: May 1990 \nThe crowd of family and friends, and of course, students. Assembled on fold-out chairs. The broad lawn. \nINTERCUT: CHRIS MCCANDLESS. We don't see his face, just feet pounding the pavement at an increasing pace. \nOne by one the names of graduates announced. Their bright young faces, capped heads, and gowns, glide up to the podium to accept their diplomas. \nINTERCUT: Chris, on his run, sweatshirt hood over head. Amongst assembled crowd and family we find: THE MCCANDLESS': BILLIE, mid to late forties with dark striking eyes; WALT, a taciturn man, early fifties; and CARINE, eighteen, pretty with her mother's eyes and waist length brown hair, a gold crucifix dangles from her neck. They look around, looking for Chris, he's nowhere in sight. \nINTERCUT: Chris, in a shower (PHOTO-SONICS) He TURNS INTO CAMERA, the water streaming down his face. \nFrom the announcement podium comes the name of their son and brother, CHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. The McCandless family increasingly panicked over Chris' absence, when almost magically, he appears in full cap and gown. \nDisregarding the steps that lead up to the podium platform, the small-framed but athletic CHRIS MCCANDLESS leaps jubilantly onto the stage in a single bound, frightening Billie, a little wince from Walt, and Carine \"That's our Chris.\" And just as quickly as Chris has been handed his diploma, he civilly descends the platform steps. \nTIME CUT: \nECU: CHRIS' EYES \nDelirious in the heat, we WIDEN OUT to see that he's filthy (2 weeks of growth on his face and naked.) He makes his way out of the tent, peers at the relentless sun and scurries to his backpack where he removes a canteen, barely a sip of water left in it. He downs it. TIME CUT: \n17   EXT. LAKE MEAD DAY                                         17 \nThe following short vignettes are silent and focused exclusively on Chris: \n1. Recreational BOATERS on Lake Mead. GIRLS in bikinis. BOYS on boats eating Kentucky Fried Chicken. \nCUT TO: \n2. At lake-side, an unusual sight - the NEW Chris McCandless, a sun and dirt-beaten bum with a backpack. \nCUT TO: \n3. A family ski-boat has taken Chris on. They give him water, dropping him at the north end of the lake at TEMPLE BAR MARINA. (Director's Note: HIGH ANGLE, TIGHT, sees Chris and the glimmering water treadmilling below) \nCUT TO: \n4. Chris washes himself in the lake by the marina. \nCUT TO: \n18   ESTABLISHING SHOT: CAFE, TEMPLE BAR MARINA                  18 \nCUT TO: \n19   INT. MARINA CAFE, UNISEX RESTROOM                           19 \nChris brushes his teeth. \nCHRIS (V.O.) I need a name. \nHe takes a swallow of water. Rinses his mouth. Spits it out. Then checks his bearded face in the mirror. He likes what he sees. \nAs he wipes the corners of his mouth with a tissue and throws it into the bin below the sink, he notices a discarded tube of lipstick. He picks it up. It's down to its end. Yet with what lipstick remains, he writes on the mirror: \nALEXANDER SUPERTRAMP WAS HERE   JULY 1990 CUT TO: \n20   EXT. MARINA CAFE (BLDG REAR) - SUNDOWN                      20 \nChris is behind the cafe beside a pair of dumpsters. He removes the Datsun's license plates from his backpack and discards them deeply into the garbage. \nCUT TO: \n17A. \n21   EXT. MARINA CAFE (BLDG FRONT) - SUNDOWN                   21 \nChris appears from behind the cafe lugging his backpack up the rise from the cafe to the highway and starts thumbing for a ride. \nCUT TO: \n22    INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE                            22 \nVARIOUS shots to accompany V.O. \nCARINE (V.O.) Toward the end of June, Chris had mailed our parents his final grade report. \nWalt and Billie open the envelope. \nCARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Almost all A's. \"A\" in Apartheid in South African Society and History of Anthropological Thought; A- in Contemporary African Politics and the Food Crisis in Africa; and on it went. Clever boy, my brother. \nWe observe Carine in a delicate afternoon light. She is sitting up on her bed with an unread book, looking out the window toward us. \nCARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) But by the end of July we hadn't heard anything from him and my parents were getting very worried. \nCarine's POV:   Walt with his arm around Billie in the yard. \nCARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Chris had never had a phone, so they decided to drive down to Atlanta and surprise him. CUT TO: \n22A   EXT. ROAD TO TAHOE                                        22A \nChris, backpack on, walking away from camera. \nCUT TO: \n23    EXT. HIGHWAY - ATLANTA - DAY (END JULY 1990)               23 \nWe see Walt and Billie's car pass under an Atlanta mileage sign. \nCARINE (V.O.) When they arrived at the apartment, there was a \"For Rent\" sign in his window, and the manager told my parents that Chris had moved out at the end of June. \n24   EXT. OFF-CAMPUS ROOMING HOUSE, ATLANTA - DAY                24 \nWe observe Walt and Billie chatting with Chris' apartment manager. \nCARINE (V.O.) When they got home, I had to hand them all the letters they had sent Chris that summer which had been returned in a bundle. \n25   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE                             25 \nThe bundle of letters are splayed out on the kitchen table - \"Return to Sender\" stamps visible. \nCARINE (V.O.) Chris had instructed the post office to hold them until August 1st so that mom and dad wouldn't know that anything was up. Some part of me understood what he had done. That he had spent the previous four years fulfilling an absurd and onerous duty in graduating from college. \nCUT TO: \n34    OMITTED                                                    34 \n35    EXT. HIGHWAY NEAR WILLOW CREEK (AUGUST 10, 1990)           35 \nA car slows to a stop. \n36    INT./EXT. CAR-HIGHWAY                                      36 \nDRIVER This is where I turn off. \nCHRIS Alright man.    Thanks a lot. \nChris is dropped off. The driver veers off the highway and into the distance. Chris is left behind to hitch another ride. \n36A   EXT. HIGHWAY                                              36A \nCAMERA is across the road from Chris as one by one cars pass him by. He turns to move north by foot and we track with him, his back to oncoming traffic, he continues to hitchhike with an extended thumb. Something catches his eye in the treeline beside the road. \nREVERSE: Chris, moving to the mysterious object. As he lifts it, we see that it is a goofy looking straw hat. He dusts it off, and snugs it onto his head, when a police car comes into frame and stops beside Chris. \nWith a quick blast of the siren, Chris turns to regard the police car. The POLICEMAN gets out of the car and moves to Chris. \nPOLICEMAN How're you doin' this evening? \nCHRIS (reluctantly) I'm alright. What's the matter? \nPOLICEMAN You wanna put your backpack down on the hood of my car. \nChris does not oblige. \nCHRIS Why? \nPOLICEMAN Because I asked you to, sir. \nCHRIS But I haven't done anything wrong.   These are my personal items. \nPOLICEMAN Do you know that it's unlawful to hitchhike on this stretch of highway. CHRIS You're kidding. \nPOLICEMAN Do you see a safe area for a vehicle to stop? We got a tree-lined highway without a substantial shoulder here. And we've had a lot of accidents on this road from people stopping in the traffic lane for hitchhikers. \nCHRIS Alright, but...I mean, you stopped your car. You're in the traffic lane. And you can see, there's hardly any cars out here. Plus, it's a straight road; you can see for a long ways. (MORE) \nCHRIS (CONT'D) (in disbelief) There's really been accidents along here? \nPOLICEMAN May I see some identification? \nNow Chris is worried. \nCHRIS I don't have any. \nPOLICEMAN You don't have any identification? \nChris shakes his head \"No.\" \nPOLICEMAN (CONT'D) (pulling out a ticket) Well, I'm gonna site you for unlawful hitchhiking. You don't have to appear. You can send a check directly to the Humboldt County Clerks Office for restitution. If you don't pay it within 30 days, you're subject to fine and warrant. I'm gonna trust that you're gonna give me accurate information. What's your name? \nChris can't bring himself to lie. \nCHRIS (a beat) McCandless. Christopher Johnson McCandless. \nCUT TO: \n37   INT. MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (MID-AUGUST 1990)          37 \nWalt, Billie, and Carine sit around the kitchen table in August. A copy of Chris' ticket has been sent to the Annandale address and sits before them. Billie and Carine sit silently. Walt's on the phone. \nCARINE (V.O.) If Chris were trying to disappear, it would have been a pretty uncharacteristic lapse for him to give the police his real place of residence. Though my parents had already contacted the Annandale police with their initial concerns, this ticket arriving from California made them frantic. (MORE) \nCARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) My father called one of his old government friends who put him in touch with a private investigator, someone who'd done work with the DIA and the CIA. Using the Willow Creek ticket as a starting point, the investigator began chasing down leads. Most of them led far afield -- to Europe and South Africa. Ultimately turning up nothing. What my dad couldn't believe was that he'd given up his car. He seemed to love that Datsun so much. It sounded just like Chris to me, though. He was very much of the school that you should own nothing except what you could carry on your back at a dead run. \n38   EXT. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY, NEAR ORICK, 60 MILES     38 SOUTH OF THE OREGON LINE - DAY (MID-AUGUST 1990) \nWith his backpack lunging and a free hand holding his goofy new hat onto his head, we find Chris at a \"dead run\" to catch a ride that had overshot him. (Director's note: Don't leave this image too soon.) An old van idles waiting for him. As he gets to the passenger side, the woman passenger gets out. This is JAN BURRES, early 40's, looks to be still on the long road home from Woodstock. A little heavyset, dark wavy hair with a lot of premature grey in it. \nJan moving to the side door. \nJAN Hi. We just barely saw you there, under that crazy hat of yours. We couldn't back up - the van's reverse is broken. CHRIS (as Jan fiddles with side door handle) Oh.   That's okay. Thanks for stopping. \nJAN This door's a little tricky, I'll get it. \nAnd with a little pulling, it opens. Indicating the pony- tailed and bearded driver (RAINEY), early 50's, definitely Woodstock... \nJAN (CONT'D) Hop in, that's Rainey. \nRAINEY Hey, I'm Rainey. \nJAN And I'm Jan. \nCHRIS Hey, Rainey.    Hi Jan.    I'm Alex. \nRAINEY Alex of the hat. \nCHRIS (closing the side door) Yeah. \nRAINEY Well, my friend, all is not well on the hippie front. \nChris pulls out his pocketknife, cuts the twine that binds the firewood to his body, and takes a seat beside Rainey. \nRAINEY (CONT'D) You're an industrious little fucker, aren't ya... Yeah, it's funny how things happen at particular times. I've loved that woman for a lot of years. But you know, she's got a...story. We've been going through this thing real quietly cause, well...So, after running into you last night, this thing we were going through quietly, she started talking about. You know what I mean? \nCHRIS I think so. \nRAINEY You think what? \nChris is looking off at Jan walking in the distance. \nCHRIS I think she's probably quietly disconnecting. It doesn't feel right to her to be close to you if there's a hole of some kind somewhere else. \nRAINEY That's a helluva insight. Jesus!... You're not Jesus, are you? You gonna walk on that water and get her back for me? \nCHRIS Actually, I'm a little afraid of water. \nRainey gives him a sideways glance. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) It's true. But it's something I've got to get over sometime. (MORE) \nCHRIS (CONT'D) So, I'll swim in it if you'll carry the firewood back to the campsite. \nRAINEY I'll carry.   Shit-yes I'll carry. \nAnd with that, Chris runs down the beach toward Jan. Rainey watches Chris and Jan chat briefly. Then they strip down to their underwear and jump into the ocean, splashing and laughing. \nANGLE: Rainey. A warmth comes over him, watching his old lady having some fun. He grabs two armfuls of wood and heads to the campsite. \nANGLE: Chris and Jan swimming in the chilly water, having a ball. \nJan increasingly indulges herself a motherly closeness and joy with Chris. And Chris allows it. She pushes the stringy hairs from his eyes, worries when he descends below the surface for too many seconds, and smiles and laughs in tender relief when from below surface one of her toes is pulled on by the big fish Chris. As he re- surfaces, she gives him a splash right in the face. \nTIME CUT: \n43   EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - LATER                          43 \nThrough a burning campfire in the late afternoon, we see the chilly bodies of Chris and Jan carrying their clothes run shivering toward us. \nRainey sits beside the campfire. RAINEY I thought you guys might need a little heat. \nJan smiles appreciatively. \nJAN (moving to Rainey) That's not hot enough. Put your arms around me. \nAs they embrace, Chris throws a coat on from his tent, puts on his funny straw hat, and grabs a book. \nRainey has wrapped a blanket around Jan and they sit beside the fire. \nCHRIS I'm going to go down the beach a ways and read a little bit. I'll bring the rest of that wood back before nightfall. \nRAINEY Alright. We might take a run into town to grab some food for tonight. \nCHRIS Sounds good. \nHe heads off down the beach. \n44   EXT. ORICK BEACH MONTAGE                                   44 \nMUSIC OVER: \n1. The ocean moving toward sunset. \n2. Seagulls, gliding inches over the water. \n3. The breeze on the sea grass. \n4. Chris in his big hat reading at water's edge. \n5. Jan and Rainey deeply engaged in conversation beside the fire. \n6. Chris closing his book, remaining meditative at water's edge. \n7. Jan and Rainey in town, buying groceries and being playful with each other. 8. OVER Chris' shoulder, the sun sets and day becomes night. \nCUT TO: \n45   EXT. CAMPSITE, ORICK BEACH - NIGHT                         45 \nJan and Rainey on a blanket sharing a joint. Chris lying beside the campfire in his sleeping bag. Jan takes a toke, passes the joint to Rainey. \nJAN You know what Alex ought to do, Rainey? He ought to come out to the Slabs this winter. \nRAINEY Oh yeah. \nRainey takes a toke on the joint. \nRAINEY (CONT'D) You'd like that if you're still on the road. Lot of fellow travelers. \nRainey offers the joint to Chris.   Chris passes it up with a hand gesture. \nCHRIS What is that? The Slabs? \nRAINEY It's down in Niland, California.   You know where the Salton Sea is? \nChris holds the large gift toward Walt. Walt moves through his friends to Chris and strips the paper, exposing a beautiful Questar Telescope. \nWALT (patting his son the back) Would you look at that. Walt holds the telescope up for all to see.   And the party responds with applause. \nChris walks through the cheering family friends to take his place beside Carine at the bottom of the steps. \nCARINE Jesus, you must've had a lot to drink. \nCHRIS Too much and not enough. I used to believe all that stuff. That whole story. I thought maybe if I said it again, I'd believe it. But I don't. \nTears have come to Chris' eyes. He puts his head in his hands. Carine puts an arm around him. \nBACK TO: \n52   EXT ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK                               52 \nPRESENT:   Walt expressionless, walking into camera. \nCARINE (V.O.) The day after the party, Chris left on his trip and ended up staying away most of the summer. It was nearly three months before he walked back into our house in Annandale. He had a scruffy beard, his hair was long and tangled, and he was rail thin. As soon as I heard he was home, I ran into his room to talk to him. In California, he'd looked up some old family friends who still lived there. He'd found out that long after he had been born, our dad had continued a relationship with his first wife Marcia in secret. \n53   EXT CUT BANK, MONTANA - SUNSET                            53 \nBRIEF CUTAWAY to Chris hitching on the Montana highway. \nCARINE And that one lie had led to another. That two years after Chris was born, dad had had another son with Marcia. Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time. And it was Chris and I who were the bastard children. \nBACK TO: \n54   EXT ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK                               54 \nWalt. \nCARINE Dad's arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused. And mom, in the shame and embarrassment of a young mistress, became his accomplice. (MORE) \n39aA. \nCARINE (CONT'D) She and my dad had decided to bend the truth about this other child saying that dad wasn't the father and they maintained that their fraudulent marriage was real. (MORE) \n39A. \nCARINE (CONT'D) Chris was quiet when he told me this. He said it made his \"entire childhood seem like a fiction\"; that \"the truth had been dying everyday.\" If something bothered Chris, he'd usually keep it to himself. And he made me promise to do the same. (MORE) \nCARINE (CONT'D) He never did tell mom and dad that he knew. But Chris measured himself and those around him by an impossibly rigorous moral code. He loathed what he considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and resented what they considered guidance. Chris submitted to dad's authority through college but I knew he raged inwardly the whole time. It was inevitable that Chris would rebel. And when he did, he did it with characteristic immoderation. \nWalt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping, heartbroken and ashamed on a quiet Annandale street in the shadowless light of dusk. \nCARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) My father is a brilliant man. But he had made some terrible mistakes. And to some extent, it seemed Chris was making him pay an awful price. \nThe image of Walt DISSOLVES INTO... \nBACK TO: \n55   EXT. CUT BANK, MONTANA (SEPTEMBER 10, 1990)                 55 \nA pick-up truck pulls over for Chris. As Chris jumps in, we see on the passenger side door, the name WAYNE WESTERBERG boldly painted across it. Chris hops in beside a hyper kinetic man with thick shoulders and a black goatee. WAYNE (rolling a cigarette without moving forward with the truck, his knees rattling up and down) How're you doing? Wayne Westerberg. \nCHRIS (shaking hands) Hi Wayne. Alex McCandless. \nWAYNE Seems like every time I come on this road, there's somebody hitching out here who looks as skinny and unfed as you. \nChris nods with a laugh.   Wayne continuing... \nWAYNE (CONT'D) Look, I gotta stop in Ethridge to drop something off (know what I mean?) \nChris is not sure about the \"drop something off\" part. \nWAYNE (CONT'D) How `bout you and I grab something to eat down there? \nCHRIS Oh, I wouldn't want to burden you. \nWAYNE How long has it been since you've had anything to eat? \nCHRIS Couple of days. I kinda ran out of money. \nWAYNE Well, there's no choice about it.    I'm gonna get you some dinner. \nWayne lights his cigarette, puts the truck in gear and they head down the road. \nAs the sun dips behind the horizon we TILT UP off the departing truck to the sky. Ominously mounting clouds stunningly reflect the red rays of the hidden sun: \nCUT TO: \n56   EXT. SUNBURST - NIGHT                                       56 Wayne's truck cuts through a track in a wheat field moving toward a compound of three trailers, one a double- wide, the other two on wheels, smaller. Beside them, a Wyeth-esque farmhouse. He eases the engine and comes to a stop in front of the double-wide. \nAs he and Chris dismount the truck, Wayne gives him a hushing finger across the lips. They tip-toe up to the door, where Wayne shuffles a bunch of keys. \nA little thunder kicking in the distant sky. \n41A. \n56A   INT. DOUBLE-WIDE - NIGHT                                  56A \nAs Wayne and Chris enter, they tip-toe over empty booze bottles and passed out work crew; Wayne's harvesting team. \nThey make their way to a small table in the kitchenette. Remains of the evening's dinner are on the stove. Wayne turns on the stovetop coils to heat it up. \nALL \"Pot o Gold.    Gotta get that pot o gold!\" \nCHRIS (raising his beer) To Carthage. \nWAYNE AND HIS MEN (toasting) To Carthage. CUT TO: \n62    OMITTED                                                    62 \n62A   EXT. HIGHWAY BETWEEN SUNBURST AND CARTHAGE                62A \nMAGIC HOUR. TELEPHOTO LENS. The harvesting convoy rolls toward us like a herd of mammoths. \n44A-45. \n63    EXT. CARTHAGE - NIGHT (LATE SEPTEMBER 1990)                63 \nA series of silent, quaint establishing tableaus. (Director's Note:    Condor above street) \nIt's a sleepy little town. Population: 274. Cluster of clapboard houses, tiny yards, and weathered brick storefronts rising humbly from the immensity of the northern plains. Stately rows of cottonwoods shade a grid of streets, seldom disturbed by moving vehicles. \nFrom UNDER CAMERA, the series of tableaus is interrupted as the convoy roars into our frame from BENEATH CAMERA. \nCUT TO: \n63A   INT. WAYNE'S TRUCK                                        63A \nIn the passenger seat, Chris is glowing at his new surroundings. Wayne picks up the CB radio. \nWAYNE Okay Kevin, get all the machines back to the elevator. I'm gonna show Chris to his room. \nKEVIN (O.S.) (over CB) I've got dibs on that shower, that shower's all me. \nWAYNE (laughs) First come, first serve buddy. Wayne signs off and veers off the road. \n64    OMITTED                                                    64 \n65   OMITTED                                                    65 \n66   EXT. WESTERBERG'S CARTHAGE HOME - NIGHT                    66 \nA two-story Victorian in the Queen Anne style. Wayne veers his truck into the front yard, parking under the big cottonwood that towers above. \nSHORT TIME CUT: \n67   INT. WESTERBERG'S CARTHAGE HOME - SAME                     67 Chris follows Wayne up the narrow stairwell. \nWAYNE (carrying Chris' pack for him) Come on up in here. This'll be your room for as long as you hang about. \nWayne opens the door at the top of the stairs. \n68   INT. CHRIS' ROOM, WESTERBERG'S CARTHAGE HOME - SAME        68 \nWayne plops Chris' pack beside a single bed in the tiny but comfortable room. Chris enters, very happy with his new quarters. \nWAYNE Shower's down the hall. If you hurry you can beat the rest of the boys to it. But you do want to grab a shower cause we're all heading over to the Cabaret in exactly thirty-six minutes. So, get your dancing shoes on. There's foo-foo in the medicine cabinet. I think it's Brut. (slaps his own face as if he's putting on cologne) Then you want to put your charm in overdrive cause we like to PAH-TAY! \nWayne gives Chris a wink and exits, shutting the door behind him. \nChris takes in his new surroundings. He's on a work crew and he likes it. Chris makes the move for the shower but by the time he opens his door to the hall, all the other crew members are barreling up the stairs in front of them, clamoring for dibs (Chris' POV) MAN #1 I got first! \nMAN #2 (in a kid voice) You had first last night! \nMAN #1 (entering the bathroom) Well, if you wanna wash my back, cowboy... \nMAN #2 You go ahead, fairy.    Just don't use all the soap. \nANGLE: Chris. He gets a kick out of these guys.    He closes the door. \nCUT TO: \n69   INT. CABARET BAR, CARTHAGE - NIGHT                          69 \nThe Jack Daniels is flowing. Wayne's crew drinks, smokes, and strikes out with every fat woman in the place. GAIL BORAH, an on-again, off-again girlfriend of Wayne's tends bar. A petite sad-eyed woman, slight as a heron, delicate features and long blond hair. Wayne and Chris sit at the end of the bar. \nWAYNE Alex, this is Gail . This is the one to go to for that White Russian you've been wanting. Of course the quid pro quo can be hazardous. \nGAIL Shut up, Wayne. (to Chris) You want a White Russian, sweetie? \nCHRIS (shyly) Yes please, ma'am. \nWAYNE Yes please, ma'am? \nWayne slaps Chris on the back. WAYNE (CONT'D) Ain't he great? GAIL (to Chris) Don't pay any attention to him. \nWith that Wayne reaches over the bar, grabs Gail and gets her in a lip-lock, to which she ultimately gives in. \nTIME CUT: \n70   INT. CABARET BAR, CARTHAGE - LATER                          70 \nWayne and Chris are both drunk. \nWAYNE Anything to do with hunting, preserving the meat, smoking it or whatever, you talk to Kevin over there. That's your man. \nANGLE: KEVIN.   He looks every bit the Grizzly Adams part. \nCUT TO: \n76   INT. CABARET BAR, CARTHAGE - LATE AFTERNOON                76 \nChris sits at the end of the bar with Gail Borah. \nCHRIS I've been thinking a lot about Alaska. \nGAIL Alaska? What kind of nut-nut are you? Alex, it's October for Christ's sake. You go to Alaska, you go in the Spring. This time of year you wanna head south. Personally, I like Las Vegas. One-armed bandit. That's what I like. \nCHRIS Yeah, maybe I ought to put off going to Alaska, at least so I can get settled up there in decent weather. \nGAIL South. You want to go south. You want me to take you out to the highway? \nCHRIS (putting on his cowboy) Little lady, I walked in, I can walk out. He puts a few bills down on the bar, saddles up his backpack, and gives Gail a hug. \nGAIL You take care of yourself now, Alex. You got a whole family here depending on it. \nCHRIS I will. Thanks Gail .   And tell Wayne, I'll drop him a line. \nHe gives her a kiss on the cheek and he's off. \nCUT TO: \n77   EXT.

COLORADO RIVER, STRETCH OF THE GRAND CANYON - DAY      79 \nChris disembarks the long-haulers truck, waves a goodbye, and the truck moves on. \nSERIES OF ANGLES: Chris walking south through the desert following the river bank. He covers twelve miles before he arrives in an Arizona town, a dusty weigh-in station. \n80   EXT. ARIZONA TOWN - NIGHT                                   80 \nThe town is quiet but along the storefront lane where Chris walks, he comes upon a sporting goods store. In the window, a fiberglass river kayak. Chris stares at it. CUT TO: \n81   EXT. INTERSTATE UNDERPASS - NIGHT                           81 \nWe HEAR passing cars humming above. Chris has set up camp and he's digging in the dirt. He buries many of his belongings. He makes sure he's got his check from working with Wayne in his pocket. He packs only the essential items, burying all else. He gets into his sleeping bag and goes to sleep. \nCUT TO: \n81A   EXT. LEE'S FERRY ROAD - DAY                              81A \nChris backpacks past the mushroom rock forms at the entrance of Lee's Ferry. \nCUT TO: \n82    INT. RANGER'S STATION - LEE'S FERRY - DAY                 82 \nChris approaches the GREEN-SUITED FUNCTIONARY at the front desk. \nGREEN SUIT Can I help you? \nCHRIS Yeah. If I wanted to paddle down the river, where's the best place to launch out of? \nGREEN SUIT \"To launch out of?\" What's your experience level? \nCHRIS Not much. \nGREEN SUIT Any?   Do you have a permit? \nCHRIS A permit for what? GREEN SUIT You can't paddle down the river without a permit. If you like, you can apply for one here, get yourself some experience, and I'll put you on the wait-list. \nCHRIS Wait-list?   To paddle down a river? \nGREEN SUIT That's right. \nCHRIS (giggling) Well, how long do you have to wait? \nGREEN SUIT I've got an opening May 2003. \nCHRIS (laughing) Twelve years? \nGREEN SUIT Well, you could always join a commercial raft trip and go with a licensed guide. They usually have a few last minute cancellations. I think it's about two- thousand dollars. \nChris busts a gut. \nCHRIS Thanks for your help. \nThe Green Suit eyes Chris' departure with suspicion. \nCUT TO: \nCHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D) After the river dried up, I ported the kayak and got a lift to Golfo. \n101   EXT. FISHING VILLAGE, EL GOLFO DE SANTA CLARA - DAY        101 \nWe see Chris jump down off the back of the duck hunter's truck. He slides the kayak off the truck bed onto the street. Chris goes into his pocket, pulls out a sealed sandwich bag of cash. He tries to pay the hunters for their time but they refuse the money. Nonetheless, Chris is insistent and they relent. \nChris pulls his backpack from inside the bow and saddles it up on his shoulders. The hunters pull away. \n102   EXT.

As we BOOM UP SLIGHTLY, we see that there is a bend in the water's edge and that he is in fact, paddling in the crystalline blue of the Gulf. \nCHRIS (V.O.) I paddled south about 20 miles. \n103   EXT. EL GOLFO DE SANTA CLARA                           103 \nUNDER-WATER SHOT: We are directly UNDER the passing kayak as it slices the water's surface above us. We BACKFLIP the CAMERA as it passes. \nCHRIS (V.O.) That's when I saw the cave and everything went upside down. \n104   EXT. EL GOLFO DE SANTA CLARA                             104 \nSee the ocean and sand, wind whipping them. CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Chris in a cave where he has made camp; watching, waiting. \nCHRIS (V.O.) A sandstorm hit and I was pretty much stuck. My kayak blew away, so I left it and walked up the beach, hitched back north, and here I am. \nCUT TO: \n105   OMITTED                                                  105 \n106   OMITTED                                                  106 \n107   OMITTED    107 \n108   OMITTED    108 \n109   OMITTED    109 \n110   OMITTED    110 \n111   OMITTED    111 \n112   OMITTED                                     112 \n113   OMITTED                                     113 \n114   OMITTED                                     114 \n115   INT.

I guess they're gonna have to watch that spillway a little better. \nCHRIS What they ought to do is open up the dams and let the rivers flow. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER I can't disagree with you on that. Okay, Alexander SuperTramp. I think we're gonna let you out of here shortly but you've got two working weeks to get an ID card in the United States. You can't be crossing these borders without identification, are we understood? \nCHRIS Yes, sir. I've eaten enough sand to send me back to the city anyway. \nCUT TO: \n116   EXT. TRAIN YARD, SOMEWHERE NEAR ALGODONES - NIGHT         116 \nA freight train cranks up its great engines and starts its move west. \nChris POV: We see a BULL (hobo slang for a railway security guard) making his rounds. As the bull disappears around the caboose, and the trains motion picks up, Chris appears from behind a fuel pump. He makes his move in the shadows to the passing freight cars, not quite sure how to board them. He begins to slowly jog beside the train. There is a vertical steel rod on each passing car. He times the train by putting his hand out and letting the vertical rods slap it. \nCHRIS (counting) One...Two...Three - \n71A. \nAnd with that he accelerates to a run, throws his pack into the moving freight car before him, simultaneously leaping up to grab the rail and throw himself into the car. \nBut his left foot misses and he's suddenly dangling from the moving train. He grabs hand over hand on the rail. \nANGLE: Dangling feet and razor sharp wheels. \nANGLE: Chris. He puts everything into pulling himself up, growling the strength into his muscles finally... \n117   INT. FREIGHT CAR - NIGHT                                  117 \nAs Chris rolls forward into the car -- he made it! \nCHRIS As Alexander Supertramp returns to civilization...a hobo. (quietly) I'm a for real hobo. \nHe's very happy about this (despite the near surrender of it.) Chris uses his pack as a pillow, lays back on it and begins to sing Roger Miller's King of the Road. \nCUT TO: \n118   EXT. FREIGHT TRAIN - NIGHT                                118 \nWe TRACK with train by HELICOPTER as we SEGUE from Chris' rendition of King of the Road to Roger Miller's. We let the train get away from us and disappear. \nCUT TO: \n130   OMITTED                                                    130 \n131   EXT.

TRAIN CAR - NIGHT                                     132 \nChris goes into his pack, grabs his canteen and drinks some water. Mid-sip, the train begins to make a surprising stop. Screeching wheels on track. Chris is alarmed. As he moves to peer out the door, even before he has a chance to see what's coming -- WHAM! He's smashed in the head with a baton. A BULL jumps into the car with him. \nBULL #2 Lay down on your stomach, spread eagle! \nChris turns to reason with the man. And that's all it takes -- six straight blows to the ribs, legs, and arms. We hear it more than we see it. Chris is in agony. \nBULL #2 (CONT'D) Let me see your face. \nThe bull shines a flashlight into Chris' eyes. \nBULL #2 (CONT'D) I never, ever, ever forget a face. If I see yours again, I won't arrest you. I'll kill you. This is the god-damned railroad. And we will do whatever we have to, to keep you freeloaders from violating our liability. \nChris is trying to understand what the man is saying. \nBULL #2 (CONT'D) If one of you people gets hurt on our train, we are liable. Do you understand that? \nCHRIS (despite the violent irony) I'm sorry, sir. \nBULL #2 You have I.D.? \nCHRIS No, sir. \nBULL #2 Of course you don't. CUT TO: \n133   EXT. TRAIN - NIGHT                                       133 \nChris is pushed off the train, his pack thrown out after him. The bull jumps down beside the track as well and walks down track away from Chris, signalling an \"all clear\" with his flashlight to some unseen engineer. \nBULL #2 (to Chris over his shoulder) Last time, my friend. \nChris stumbles to his feet. The pain of the beating is real. He bleeds from the back of his ear. But he can walk. And he does. \nCUT TO: \n134   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY                                 134 \nChris sits on his pack on the roadside, hitchhiking and eating from a can of beans he opened with his pocketknife. The odd car passes but doesn't stop. \nCUT TO: \n135   EXT. ARIZONA INTERSTATE OVERPASS - NIGHT                  135 \nChris hops out of a Camaro that gave him a ride.   The lighting is anonymous and so is the driver. \nCHRIS Thanks very much. \nHe closes the door and the car drives off. We follow Chris as he goes to the overpass edge. He drops his pack over the side. Chris climbs down the edge of the overpass, grabs his pack, and scurries into the UNDERPASS below. (We suddenly recognize this as his pre-river run campsite) \nHe digs up his buried belongings, returning them to his pack. Last to come out of the ground, Chris' copy of Jack London's Call of the Wild. He pulls off a temp wrapping and dusts it off. Chris lights his candle lantern and begins to read. O.S. VOICES from the PAST: \nBILLIE (O.S.) (screaming, angry) I'm not talking about this anymore! \nFeet stomping off. \nWALT (O.S.) Don't walk away from me WOMAN! \nBILLIE (O.S.) Fuck you!

MCCANDLESS HOME, ANNANDALE (PAST)                    136 \nELEVEN-YEAR OLD CARINE sits in the stairwell leading to her parent's room where an argument ensues. Carine's head in her hands, a delicate tear moistens the webs between her small fingers. \nFIFTEEN-YEAR OLD CHRIS enters from O.S. He leans against the stairwell and looks up the stairs. Our focus remains on Carine. In the B.G. SOFT FOCUS, Walt is pinning Billie down onto the bed. She flails at him but he holds down her shoulders. \nWALT LOOK WHAT YOUR MOTHER IS MAKING ME DO! \nBillie slips his grasp. Walt reaches out with a hit/push of her back. She is thrust out of the bedroom onto the landing above the staircase followed by Walt who positions himself in the doorway like a hostile crucifixion. \nWALT (CONT'D) (raging) I'll just cancel Christmas then! \nBillie returns to him, punching on his chest: \nBILLIE Who do you think you are?   God? \nWALT Yes.   I'm God! \nChris puts his hand out to Carine. She looks up to him. He gives her a smile and a wink. She takes his hand and they exit frame as the argument continues. \nWALT (O.S.) (CONT'D) Where do you kids think you're going? \nBILLIE (O.S.) (not in desperation so much as a demand for their witness) Kids, get back here! \nCHRIS I'm sorry.   This is Rainey.   And I'm Chris. \nWhoops, a slip on the name, but... \nRAINEY Hi. Rainey. And this is Alex.

And I thought my husband and I were going to invent peace on earth and stay together forever. But it didn't work out that way. He left. History. Now ancient history. And that was the end of that. So, I raised Reno by myself - that's my son. Then I met Rainey. And that was really good for a while. But Reno was already a teenager and was becoming a man in his own way. And then, I don't know. He kinda followed in his father's footsteps - out the door and gone. And I really don't know where he is. I haven't heard from him in two years. \nCHRIS I hope I get to meet him sometime. Jan looks into Chris' eyes and smiles with pure love. She leans over and gently kisses Chris on the cheek. \nJAN Do your folks know where you are? \nChris aims to deflect the question as Tracy enters the          * scene. \nTRACY                                    * Soup's on. Oh, I'm sorry.   Are you guys getting heavy? \nJAN No, sweetheart. Just hungry. You've been doing a fantastic job over there.

Makes that Tantric stuff go even better. \nRAINEY How the hell would you know? That poor girl over there is about ready to vault onto a fence post. And here you are, the monk of Jack LaLane. \nThey share a laugh. Chris comes to the end of his sit- ups. Wipes his brow with a towel. Rainey squats down next to him. \nRAINEY (CONT'D) I guess Jan filled you in. About Reno and everything. Children can be harsh judges when it comes to their parents. They don't grant clemency easily. I think Reno tended to see things in black and white. I just hope he lives long enough to forgive her. \nThe connection is not lost on Chris. \nRAINEY (CONT'D) But painful as it is, you turned a light on in her and I'm grateful. \nCHRIS Me too. \nRAINEY For what? \nChris doesn't answer. A kid rides by on a bright new Big Wheel. Must be from the rich side of the commune. \nRAINEY (CONT'D) Do your folks know where you are? CHRIS No. \nRAINEY Don't you think they ought to? \nCHRIS They should. But I can't. Not yet, anyway. I got a sister though, Carine. She's the most beautiful girl in the world. But, it's all got to stay behind me until I get where I'm going. \nRAINEY Alaska? \nCHRIS Yeah, Rainey. Alaska. \nRainey won't intrude any further. He just nods. Chris notices Tracy in the door of her parent's rig, stealthily       * waving him over. Chris gives Rainey the \"Uh-oh\" look, pulls on his T-shirt, and walks over to the rig.

CARINE He'd take them on what he loved to refer to as \"epic\" runs. The whole point was to run until they were completely lost and so exhausted that they were on the verge of puking. Then they'd slow down a little, somehow he'd find their bearings, and lead them home again at full speed. This was my brothers idea of fun. \nWe FAVOR Chris as he jogs in place at the exhilarating point of being lost. When he has identified a most likely return route, he quickens his pace, leading the group in the direction of return. \nCUT TO: \n171   INT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY                      171 \nChris heads out with his last Burger King check in hand, proudly wearing his new hat and in search of mountains to climb. \nCARINE (V.O.) A year and a half into Chris' disappearance, each day that goes by now feels like two. Dad calls it \"suspended animation.\" I kept telling myself that he had to get lost to prove his independence to himself. But this was no day run for the Road Warriors and after so much time, I could no longer keep out the haunting thoughts. \n172   EXT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY - DAY                172 \nChris, with pack and new hat walks away from camera toward the interstate and the brittle mountains beyond. \nCARINE (V.O.) In many ways, my life and even my parents had begun to move in new directions. I'd fallen in love. And mom and dad had even ventured out on a brief vacation. But, when a search of tax records uncovered Chris' contribution to OXFAM, the weight of his disappearance just seemed to lie down on us full length. \nCHAPTER 5: GETTING OF WISDOM DISSOLVE TO: \n173   EXT. BADLANDS OF ANZA-BORREGO DESERT STATE PARK - DAY     173 (JANUARY 1992) \nWIDE SHOT: We see the Oh My God Hot Springs. Steaming pools lined with rocks and shaded by palm trees.

CHRIS' CAMP BESIDE THE STONE WALL - DAY              175 \nChris rests on the sand under a tarp, hung from a Creosote branch.

OH-MY-GOD HOT SPRINGS - DAY                          176 \nChris on a morning jog, wearing a shoulder bag and carrying an empty water jug.

PAVED TWO-LANE ROAD INTO SALTON CITY - DAY           177 \nChris continues his jog, cars whisk by and dust kicks into the air. But Chris is undeterred, keeps running. \n178   EXT. MARKET/POST OFFICE, SALTON CITY - SAME               178 \nChris approaches, slowing his jog to a walk. Chris sets down his water jug and stretches his calves. In the distance we see the peaks of the badlands landforms from where he ran. \nChris shakes off the jog, picks up the jug, and we go with him around the side of the building. There's a water faucet dripping slowly into the desert mud. Chris pops his jug under it and fills it up. \nCUT TO: \n179   INT. MARKET/POST OFFICE - SAME                           179 \nChris walks the aisles, sipping from his jug, as he comes across bags of rice on the market shelves. A HEAVY SET GIRL passes him in the aisle with her well-mannered dog following her. \nCHRIS (no high-pitched pet voice) Hey boy. You are a handsome fellow. (over shoulder to the girl) Beautiful dog. \nTHE GIRL Thank you. \nAs the girl continues on, the dog wants to stay with Chris. \nCHRIS Go on, boy.    Go on. \nAnd the dog obeys him. \nAs he sorts through the various rice selections, brown, white, wild, we notice a MAN peering over the opposite shelf at Chris. This is RON FRANZ, between 70 and 80 years old, six-feet, thick arms, barrel chest, and large ears. He wears old jeans, an immaculate white T-shirt, a decorative tooled leather belt, white socks, and scuffed black loafers. His deeply pitted nose demonstrates a purple filigree of veins which unfold like an finely wrought tattoo. And on either side of it, the wary blue eyes of a soldier. He is the archetypical American man. Chris has caught his sympathetic eye. Chris moves to the counter to pay for rice. \nCUT TO: \n180   EXT.

As they approach the bottom of the hill - \nRON (CONT'D) How about you and me take a drive? About fifty miles or so up highway, I know a place that's got a view, great food, and requires no climbing. How's that sound? \nChris thinks about it.     Then - \nCHRIS Yeah, sure. It'll take me a couple of minutes to clean up. \nRON Fair enough. \nCUT TO: \n186   EXT.

Other passengers on the tram seem nervous, but Ron is meditative, almost hypnotized. \nAnd with each roll-through of the tram through the cable towers, the tram car rocks and sways, but Ron's peace goes unbroken. And Chris continues to admire the gentle blinking of his eyes. \nCUT TO: \n190   INT. ELEVATION RESTAURANT (SAN JACINTO SUMMIT) - TWILIGHT90 \nThe two of them sit in a quiet, corner   booth of the tramway eatery that sits on the summit   of San Jacinto overlooking the lights of Palm Springs   and the desert clear back to Salton Sea. Chris is on    a roll. \nCHRIS How old are you, Mr. Franz? \nRON Seventy-nine years old. \nCHRIS Seventy-nine...see, all due respect, but the real difference between people is the quality of their soul and not on how long they've trudged around like a dip-shit. \nRon laughs. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) But it's true. \nRON It is.   No question about that. \nRon continues to let Chris vent. CHRIS The government's the same as my parents. They don't respect anybody. Regulation. Regulation. Regulation. WE can't do this. But THEY can do that. I mean, the hypocrisy of the whole...culture.   Makes me crazy. My father was having children                * with two women at the same time, and then              * has the gall to think that he can be of some guidance to me? Make judgments on me? My mother, of course, goes along with all of it. Keeps the secret, which of course, makes my whole life a fiction. Everything I thought was, wasn't. They're such fools! Fucking idiots! \nRON Alex, please don't lump me in amongst your judges. And your tyrants. But I'd prefer to not hear that kind of language. \nCHRIS (realizing his slip) Sorry. I don't usually use that kind of language either. I just get so angry thinking about it. \nRon reaches across the table.    Puts his sturdy hand on Chris' shoulder. \nRON You got a lot of passion, young man. \nChris smiles at Ron. \nCUT TO: \n191   EXT.

Chris hops out and walks around to Ron's side of the truck. \nCHRIS Awww, that was a great time Mr. Franz. Thank you. \nRON Look here. If Charles Manson and his buddies don't kill me on my way out of here, I'd like to cook you up a home cooked meal tomorrow night. If I come out here about, say, four o'clock tomorrow, how would that be? \nCHRIS That would be swell. \nRon is thrilled. \nRON Good, good. I'm no gourmet but I know where the spices are.

And down at the bottom of the rock wall beside the campsite, is Ron holding up two fishing poles. RON (CONT'D) (referring to the Sea) That thing's twice as salty as the ocean. Did you know that? \nChris has barely the breath to speak. \nCHRIS Anything alive in it? \nRon shrugs his shoulders in a \"who cares?\" fashion.

Except I already know the answer. \nRON You do, do you? \nCHRIS I do, Mr. Franz. You've got to get back out in the world. Get out of that lonely house of yours, that little workshop, and go live on the road. \nRon waves him off. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Really. You're going to live a long time, Ron. You should make a radical change in your lifestyle. The core of man's spirit comes with new experiences. And there you are, stubborn old man, sitting on your butt. \nRON Sittin' on my butt, huh? \nRon gets up off the tailgate. \nRON (CONT'D) I'll show you sittin' on my butt. \nAnd Ron starts making the old man hustle. Shifty shoulders and all, up the stone wall. \nRON (CONT'D) (mumbling) \"Stubborn old man.\" \nChris is laughing and clapping. \nCHRIS Come on, old man! Come on! \nRON (mumbling) Ya little pinhead. \nChris is jumping up and down, thrilled for Ron's efforts. Now the old man's shuffle has turned into an old man's walk. But he ain't stopping. And bit by bit he shows he's got it in him after all. \nAs Ron is just about to mount the summit, Chris extends a hand. Ron swats it away. \nRON (CONT'D) Ya little pinhead. \nRon drops down onto his back to catch his breath and let his thumping heart slow down. \nRon nods. Chris gets out of the truck. Ron watches as Chris saddles up his bag including the duffel that Ron gave him. \nChris crosses the exit junction to where he can pick up a ride north on the far side of the road. \nWe ZOOM SLOWLY through the windshield into Ron's face as he watches Chris hitching away. \nWe HEAR the first bars of Neil Young's My My, Hey Hey.

I asked Chris who had written the poem. \nWhat we SEE of Carine plays with the VOICE OVER TRACK and SILENT with the production track; in essence lip synching herself. Chris' dialogue comes directly from the flashback image. \nCARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) Who wrote that? \nCHRIS Well, it could've been either one of us. Couldn't it? \nWe see pictures of Chris on the night-stand of Walt and Billie's bedroom \nCARINE (V.O.) What would he tell about now?   What did his voice sound like now? (MORE) \nCARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I realized that the words to my thoughts were of less and less meaning.

Chris moves up through the underbrush and the snow into the narrow tree line and on into the clearing, where before him: \nA DERELICT SCHOOL BUS. It is a vintage International Harvester from the 1940's. \nChris approaches the bus, lifts the hood a little bit seeing that the engine is gone.

He loves what he sees. \nCELEBRATORY MUSIC OVER: \nHe runs up a berm to look down into the river. \nHe runs from corner to corner of this \"Magic Bus\" area like a new bride surveying her honeymoon suite with glee. \nHe climbs a tree, swings from its branch, doing a flip in the air, landing on his feet, but then slipping on the snow and onto his butt and then onto his back. He grabs a handful of snow, shoves it in his mouth, melts it into water, and swallows it. \nCRANE SHOT:   We PULL UP from Chris to high above the clearing. \nMUSIC FADES OUT \nCUT TO: \n225   INT./EXT.

Beside them, a camper's backpack. \nChris sits in introspection at his desk by candlelight. The room is spare, supporting his monkish lifestyle. But on the desk before him, he counts out $500.68 from a bank envelope. He pockets those bills and change, then removes a check for $24,000 made out to OXFAM America from the same bank envelope. He scribbles a note: These are all my savings. Feed someone with it. Signed, Chris McCandless.

Other than that, no sound on the desert floor. \nIn the distance, voluptuous cumulonimbus clouds boil upward catching the last rosy glow of the west-setting sun over the rim of the upper Detrital watershed.

His head supported by his backpack. We begin to HEAR a rumble. But this rumble is not thunder. It rapidly builds into an alarming ROAR. The roar grows to a deafening level. Chris awakens. \nAs he peeks up from the backseat looking forward through the windshield, he just barely catches sight of the leading edge of a flash flood. A four-foot high wall of water, mud and debris makes impact with the Datsun, momentarily enveloping it in water. Suddenly the car is SLAMMED against the cliff. CRACK! Chris sits upright, disoriented. \nPOV: As far as the eye can see in the desert moonlight, water has taken over the desert with a flash flood. \nHowever, there's no panic in Chris' face as we observe him past a new crack in the wet windshield. The water, while violent seems to have topped off just above the wheels. Chris gets a slight smile on his face, as the car settles into its new position below the cliff.

Somewhere in here lies the secret of the great beast within us all. A beast built on lies, corruption, and greed. \nWe HEAR a GROWLING SOUND from behind Chris. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) And there it is!

Your humble reporter, Chris McCandless will now struggle with the journalistic question of ethics: Will he retain his reporter's objectiveness or save the future of human truth by slaying this awful beast? \nHe gives us a look of vaudevillian puzzlement - what will he do? \nCONTINUE VIDEO: \nWe pick up with Chris in a corridor outside a door with a cheap paper-and-tape label announcing the adjacent room as the office of Ted Turner. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) Once again, your humble reporter Chris McCandless. \nWe HEAR OS students commenting on Chris and his video crew: \nOS STUDENT What is this?

We've got a monster in the vault. It represents all the corruption, the deceit, and greed within us all. I must slay it. \nTED TURNER/STUDENT (worst acting we've ever seen) McCandless, how many times have I had to tell you? I've had to tell you that you are a journalist and you can't get personally involved in your cases...or your stories. \nCHRIS Ted! I know how to kill it. And I'm the only one who knows. You can't keep sending me on stories and expecting me to do nothing! I look like some kind of an idiot. \nTED TURNER/STUDENT Do you know who you're talking to?   I'm Ted Turner. \nBehind Chris in the corridor outside Ted's office, a PANICKED STUDENT arrives at the door. \nPANICKED STUDENT McCandless! You've got to hurry! The monster is scratching at the hatchway. He'll be out in no time. \nTED TURNER/STUDENT (threatening) It'll mean your job, Chris McCandless. \nCHRIS (to Ted) That's it, Ted. Fire me if you want but this beast must be slayed. Microphone in hand, Chris makes haste. The CAMERA RUNS WITH HIM out the door, through the corridor, up a set of steps to the hatchway. As he arrives, the monster appears above him in the hatchway crawl space having pulled off the board Chris had nailed. \nCHRIS (CONT'D) (into camera) This is the only thing that can kill the monster. It's gonna be risky but without great risk, there is no freedom. So we will now hear from the famous singer - Chris McCandless. \nA piano is PUSHED INTO FRAME beside Chris. A YOUNG BLACK STUDENT pulls a stool in front of the piano and begins to play. Chris begins to serenade the monster, intermittently sharing the serenade directly into camera as well. He bursts into an uninhibited solo of Tender Is The Night. \nCAMERA TILTS UP to the monster looking out the hatchway, slowly dying from the song being sung. \nAs the song continues to be sung and the monster continues to die, the AUDIO RECEDES and VIDEO IMAGES GO TO SLO MO. \nCARINE (V.O.) When we were little, Chris was very to himself. He wasn't anti-social, he always had friends, and everybody liked him - but he could go off and entertain himself for hours, he didn't seem to need toys or friends. He could be alone without being lonely. The secrets our parents kept, though unknown to Chris and I, led to bouts of rage and even violence between them that we had been forced to witness since we were very young. It seemed like they never fought without us. I remember the first family meeting to let Chris and me in on their plans for getting a divorce. They wanted us to choose which of them we'd live with. I cried my eyes out. But the divorce never happened, though the threats and meetings never stopped. It wasn't long before Chris and I shut off -- we would tell mom and dad to go ahead and get the divorce. Chris and I just wanted to get away from their fights and mom kept promising to get out and take us with her as soon as their company made enough money. Dad had been the young genius [that] NASA enlisted to do [crucial] designs for the American satellite radar systems that would be our answer to the Russian Sputnik. And mom and he later started up a consulting firm combining her get-up- and-go resourcefulness with his wealth of knowledge. By the time the company actually made its first million, the careerism and money seemed to erase her memory of the promise she'd made us. (MORE) \nCARINE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I think this is when Chris began to see \"careers\" as a diseased invention of the twentieth century and to resent money and the useless priority people made of it in their lives.

Pointing the river patrol back upriver, he yells: \nMADS He went thattaway!

It would be Christmas in a couple of months. And the last news we'd had was about his car being found. I woke up a couple of days ago, and for the first time, I was surprised to realize that it wasn't only my parents who hadn't heard from Chris.

Kids play naked in a mud pool. \nCUT TO: \n158   EXT. THE BOOTH OF JAN & RAINEY, THE SLABS - SAME          158 \nWe see Rainey selling their wares. Beside the booth, their van with its backseat door open. A little dog, Sunni, jumps out the van door, sniffing something out. Jan exits the van after the dog. \nJAN Sunni!    Come here boy. \nBut Sunni has sniffed out Chris' large backpack leaning against the rear of the van. Jan is just beginning to recognize it, when from behind the van appears Chris, looking like a million bucks. \nCHRIS Surprise! \nJAN (overjoyed) Alex! \nAs she goes to hug him - \nANGLE: Rainey hearing his name, jumps up from his stool to join them. \nBig embraces all around. CUT TO: \n159   EXT. THE SLABS - NIGHT                                    159 \nAn impromptu campfire celebration with live music from a makeshift stage. Jan, Rainey, and Chris sit on chairs outside the circle of inhabitants, taking in the music. \nJAN You have to tell us everything. (Note: This scene should largely be improvised. They all know their characters, their history. Jan and Rainey are doing great. And while Chris is intermittently aware that the eyes of a pretty 16-year old girl are upon him, Chris lays out his travels and his PLAN FOR ALASKA. \nJan remarks, \"I guess if you can figure out how to paddle a canoe down to Mexico, hop freight trains, and score beds at inner-city missions, you can figure out Alaska too.\") \nAt this point, the PRETTY 16-YEAR OLD GIRL who had had her eyes on Chris, takes the stage with an acoustic guitar, introduces herself as TRACY, then SINGS an              * innocent love song of her own composition, stealing seductive glances at Chris throughout the performance. \nJAN (CONT'D) I think you've made yourself a friend. \nCHRIS (blushing) She's only a teenager. \nJAN Good luck. \nThe girl finishes her song. \nCUT TO: \n160   EXT. THE BOOTH OF JAN & RAINEY - DAY                      160 \nChris and Rainey man the second-hand goods booth while Jan bathes Sunni in a steel bucket by the van. Among the goods, a USED ORGAN. Chris is thrilled to have access to all the second-hand books that are part of Rainey and Jan's inventory. As he skims through Jack London's Odyssey of the North, Rainey notices Tracy sitting on the       * steps of her vagabond parents' rig across from the booth. She picks silently at her guitar with her bright eyes fixed on Chris. RAINEY How long can you stay with us? \nCHRIS Well, I'm waiting on a check from my last job to come into Salton City the day after Christmas. I've got to start thinking about getting ready for Alaska. When the sun gets a little lower tonight, I'm going to start a calisthenics routine. I think after the check comes in, I'll try to find some mountains I can climb everyday till spring comes. I gotta see how far the money's gonna go. (MORE) \nCHRIS (CONT'D) I'm going to have to pick up a lot of supplies before spring. So, I might take another job or I might be okay. \nRAINEY Well, you know, we'll give you a little something for every day you work the booth. \nCHRIS I'm not taking any money from you, Rainey.   It's been a real great twist meeting you two. You look like you're doing good. \nRAINEY We are, and you were a big part of that, coming along when you did. Yep, things are good. (gives a little giggle) Man, I used to think Tantric sex was just a bunch of reading. Speaking of which, don't you think you ought to introduce yourself to Joni Mitchell over there? \nChris looks up from his book to the wide open 16-year old smile of Tracy. Rainey laughs aloud. Chris smiles back,      * and against his better instincts, gives her a little wave- over with the paperback. Tracy jumps off her step,           * putting her guitar inside the rig, and trots like a little wood nymph to Chris. \nTRACY                                 * Hi. \nCHRIS Hi. TRACY                                 * You selling books? \nCHRIS I am.   We are. \nTRACY                                 * I read a lot. \nCHRIS Do you? \nTRACY                                 * Yeah. \nCHRIS That's good.    I heard you play your song last night. \nTRACY                                    * (embarrassed) I'm terrible. \nRainey amused by all of this. \nCHRIS You are not terrible. \nTRACY                                  * I'm not? \nCHRIS No.   You sing sweet. \nTRACY                                    * Thank you. I was going to go watch the kids play in the mud. Do you want to go? \nRAINEY Go on.   I'll watch the store. \n", "test3_id": 944}

The day after the party, Chris left on his trip and ended up staying away most of the summer. It was nearly three months before he walked back into our house in Annandale. He had a scruffy beard, his hair was long and tangled, and he was rail thin. As soon as I heard he was home, I ran into his room to talk to him. In California, he'd looked up some old family friends who still lived there. He'd found out that long after he had been born, our dad had continued a relationship with his first wife Marcia in secret. \n53   EXT CUT BANK, MONTANA - SUNSET                            53 \nBRIEF CUTAWAY to Chris hitching on the Montana highway. \nCARINE And that one lie had led to another. That two years after Chris was born, dad had had another son with Marcia. Worse yet was that it was Marcia to whom he was still legally married at the time. And it was Chris and I who were the bastard children. \nBACK TO: \n54   EXT ANNANDALE STREET - DUSK                               54 \nWalt. \nCARINE Dad's arrogance made him conveniently oblivious to the pain he caused.

(MORE) \n39A. \nCARINE (CONT'D) Chris was quiet when he told me this. He said it made his \"entire childhood seem like a fiction\"; that \"the truth had been dying everyday.\" If something bothered Chris, he'd usually keep it to himself. And he made me promise to do the same. (MORE) \nCARINE (CONT'D) He never did tell mom and dad that he knew. But Chris measured himself and those around him by an impossibly rigorous moral code. He loathed what he considered mom and dad's hypocrisy and resented what they considered guidance. Chris submitted to dad's authority through college but I knew he raged inwardly the whole time. It was inevitable that Chris would rebel. And when he did, he did it with characteristic immoderation. \nWalt suddenly collapses to his knees weeping, heartbroken and ashamed on a quiet Annandale street in the shadowless light of dusk. \nCARINE (V.O.)

Okay. \nJust then, the rain kicks in full gear outside, pounding the trailer shell. A couple hits of lightning follow. \nWAYNE Listen, you don't want to go out there on the road tonight. Why don't you just roll your sleeping bag out and play like a Hudderite until morning. \nChris looks about. There's not much room but it beats the pelting outside. \nCHRIS Thanks Wayne.

And that an unshared happiness is not happiness... \nChris steals his pencil from within the pages of the book, scribbling across the page: \nCHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.) (CONT'D) HAPPINESS ONLY REAL WHEN SHARED. \nHe flips backwards a couple of pages to where he had written the quote: \nCHRIS (V.O.)(O.C.) (CONT'D) CALL EVERYTHING BY ITS RIGHT NAME. \nHe tears the back cover off the book and scratching the pencil across its blank side, writing these words quickly, as if in panic: \nI HAVE HAD A HAPPY LIFE AND THANK THE LORD.    GOODBYE AND MAY GOD BLESS ALL! \nAnd now, these words arrive slowly as we HEAR Chris repeating: CHRIS (O.C.) (CONT'D) (with a weak voice) Call everything by its right name. \nThe drumbeat increases as he signs the note: \nCHRISTOPHER JOHNSON MCCANDLESS. \nWe move from the page back up to Chris. We see that he has put on his eyeglasses to strengthen the vision of his weakening sight. He removes them, folds them, and lays them by his side. His body begins to tremble. His eyes dance wildly. \nThe drumming intensifies. \nChris takes one last look out the window. The sun is covered by a well-defined and puffy cloud. \nHis arm nearing spasm reaches up to the bunk, grasping at the blue sleeping bag made by his mother. \nWith great suffering and shattering trembles, he forces his body to defy its agony and pushes it into the sleeping bag. \nSKYWARD, the cloud obscuring the sun. \nDrumbeats ESCALATE - BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! BOOM! We TIGHTEN on Chris' anguished face. (Director's note: These CU's on Chris' face, combine both static and hand-held CUs, upside down and right-side up moving, zooms, and push-ins. Straight, side, and dutch angles. Perhaps some intermittent distortion.) \n268   INT./EXT. BUS                                             268 \nWe INTERCUT between Chris and the sky in a dance transitioning to the next world. It is hopeful, anguished, sad, and elated. \n269   INT./EXT. ANNANDALE HOUSE - DAY                           269 \nChris, approaching the Annandale house.    His backpack on and body healthy. \nBillie parts the curtains, ecstatic to see Chris approach, alive and healthy. \nWe SEE but do not hear her call to Walt. \nA smiling Chris steps up the curb, approaching home. \nWalt and Billie - we PUSH INTO them as they gleefully run out the front door to their returning son. \nPUSH INTO Chris - he dispatches his backpack to the ground and runs toward his parents' embrace. \nCHRIS (V.O.) What if you saw me running into your arms... \nChris, Walt, and Billie on the cusp of a jubilant and loving embrace! \nCHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D) Would you see then... \nThe DRUMMING resumes with a BLAST OF BASS and before an embrace is possible... CHRIS (V.O.) (CONT'D) ...what I see now? A SUDDEN CUT TO: \n270   INT. BUS                                                  270 \nTOTAL SILENCE \nChris looking at the sky, a cathartic tear falls from his left eye. Another from his right as the obscuring cloud clears the sun. \nChris: The LAST, AIRY EXPULSION OF HIS BREATH. \nHis open face as the clearing light of the sun shines in his eyes. It is a face of peace, love, a face of true, deep serenity. \nThe eyes joyously open and the corners of his mouth ease into the subtle smile of euphoric wisdom. \nThat's the way he settles to stillness, looking directly into our camera. \n", "test3_id": 944}

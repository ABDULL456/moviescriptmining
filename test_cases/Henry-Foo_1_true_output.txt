Fay slams out of the side door of the house in a tight-fitting dress and stands on the lawn, applying lipstick. 
FAY God, I wanna get fucked. 
Fay snaps shut her compact, straightens her skirt and sighs. 
FAY You OK? 
Simon loses track of what he is hearing and relaxes. He looks back at his sister. 
Fay fluffs out her hair and walks off. 
FAY See ya later. 
Simon watches her go, but is still drawn to something he seems to hear up the street in the other direction. He cocks his head, sits perfectly still and listens. 
He hears it now. We do, too. Footsteps. Big ones. Like a giant somewhere in the distance. The neighborhood trembles. 
Titles begin. 
Simon tries to figure out where it's coming from; the sky, the house, the highway at the end of his block... Finally, he focuses on... 
The blacktop right before him, smeared with his own blood. 
Music starts. 
He kneels out slowly into the street and stares at the pavement. He stretches out his hand and places it flat on the road. The pounding is louder now, becoming the beat of the music over the scene. 
Simon lowers his face to the pavement, closes his eyes and... 
Puts his ear right down against the road. He hears... 
The steady tread of somebody very much larger than life. 
Kneeling forward, with his ear to the ground, Simon opens his eyes and sees... 
A man approaching. The music swells up full. 
Simon lifts his head slowly from the road, looking off in wonder at... 
This stranger coming towards him; an oddly handsome freak striding over the crest of the distant intersection with a windswept mane, two over-stuffed suitcases and a crumpled tie fluttering back over his broad but crooked shoulders. 
Simon rises till he's kneeling up straight in the road. 
Henry Fool finally reaches him and stops. 
Titles finish. 
Simon says nothing and watches as Henry looks off at the house. 
Satisfied, but wary, Henry Fool looks around the neighborhood and then down at Simon. 
HENRY Get up off your knees. 
He tosses the suitcases down in front of Simon and walks off towards his new home. 
EXT. BACK OF THE GRIM HOUSE -- DAY 
Henry comes around behind the house and finds the door to his basement apartment. He approaches. Simon follows, carrying the suitcases. 
INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT -- DAY 
Moments later. 
The door is wrenched open and Henry is hit square in the jaw by a decade of dank airless gloom. He coughs. 
Entering, he finds a few old wooden chairs littering the main room. He inspects the old wood stove, then takes a chair and smashes it. He tosses the wood in the stove. 
Simon looks on, amazed. Henry lights a fire with unusually quick results, then stands back and looks at Simon. 
HENRY Where you gotta go to get a six-pack of beer around here? 
INT. WORLD OF DONUTS -- DAY 
This is a convenience store with a number of tables at which to eat donuts. 
Warren is shoplifting while Amy terrorizes Gnoc Deng, the Vietnamese cashier, who stares out at them from behind the safety of the counter. 
AMY Say something. 
WARREN (calling) She's mute. 
AMY What? 
WARREN She don't -- you know -- talk. 
Amy looks back at Gnoc, snarls, then follows the cashier's gaze to the door. 
Simon enters. Clutching Henry's cash, he stops dead in his tracks when he sees... 
Warren and Amy. 
He steps forward and approaches the beer cooler. 
Warren and Amy hover around, just out of reach, like a couple of vampires. 
Dragging a six-pack out of the cooler, Simon crosses to the counter. Warren and Amy hang back, silent and threatening. 
Gnoc rings up the purchase and glances over at... 
Amy, staring a hole into the side of Simon's skull. 
Gnoc hands Simon back his change and he makes for the door, but...

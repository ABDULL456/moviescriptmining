VICTOR We'll leave this afternoon, right after the ceremony. Pack only what you need. 
ELIZABETH Does this have something to do with that man you saw? 
VICTOR (hesitates) Yes. We're in danger here. Every moment we stay. 
ELIZABETH Victor, tell me why! Trust me! 
VICTOR I do. But you must trust me for now. 
INT - BEDROOM - DAY 
A small ceremony has been hurriedly organized at Father's bedside. The old man holds Elizabeth's hand. Softly: 
FATHER This is not... the grand wedding... I had hoped to give you... 
He releases her hand, giving the bride away. She takes her place at Victor's side. Henry stands as best man. The PRIEST faces them: 
PRIEST We gather now in the sight of God to witness this man and woman bond their lives in matrimonial vow. 
EXT - MANSION - DAY 
Elizabeth gets in the coach. Claude clambers up to the driver's seat armed with a rifle, ready to pull out. EIGHT MEN on horseback provide armed escort. Victor addresses the men staying behind, all of whom are also armed: 
VICTOR Be especially on your guard. Stay cautious to a fault. 
STABLE HAND Who is this man, sir? How shall we know him? 
VICTOR He is huge and deformed... and quite insane. 
CLAUDE He killed Master William and sent Justine Moritz to the noose! No hesitation, lads! Shoot the bastard on sight! 
CRIES of assent. 
Victor pulls Henry aside: 
VICTOR Are you sure you'll be all right? 
HENRY Yes, don't worry. I'll look after your father. You look after her. 
VICTOR I'll be back as soon as I've got her far away and safe. We'll hunt this fiend down together. 
HENRY Only if you'll tell me who he is. 
VICTOR (hesitates) I owe you that. Done. 
A quick embrace. Victor leaps into the coach. 
ANGLE FROM FATHER'S BEDROOM WINDOW 
The coach clatters up the road, trailed by the eight horsemen. Those left behind scatter across the courtyard. 
Henry turns and walks back toward the house. ANGLE WIDENS to reveal the Creature at the window.  In the bed behind him, The old man stirs, opening his eyes 
FATHER Victor? 
...and sees the Creature turn toward him. Father's eyes go wide as his final stroke is triggered. His life ends with a prolonged death-rattle... and a soft exhale. The Creature reaches down, closes his eyes. A tender gesture. 
A LOUD GASP. The Creature whirls. There stands the priest, dropping his tea to the floor. The Creature sweeps across the room, presses him against the wall. 
PRIEST (breathless with horror) You're the Devil himself. 
CREATURE Yes, and I've come to snatch your soul... (leans close) ...unless you tell me where they've gone. 
EXT - LAKE GENEVA - DUSK 
A magnificent sunset bathes the mountains as storm clouds roll in. A ferry is crossing the lake, moving away from us, rippling the water. TILT DOWN to reveal... 
EXT - FERRY DOCK - DUSK 
Claude trotting to the window of the coach. 
CLAUDE That was the last ferry. There's nothing else till morning. 
VICTOR Damn it 
CLAUDE We'll ride on ahead and secure you lodging for the night. 
EXT - RESORT - NIGHT 
A big chalet nestled in the woods by the lake. The storm is raging. Claude and his men are positioned at the entrances. 
VICTOR Make sure you keep your pistols dry 
GUARD #2 They're dry enough. And if they fail, we've others. And if those fail... (draws his saber halfway) ...we can always gut the bastard. 
CLAUDE Don't worry, sir. You're well guarded. Now why don't you go upstairs to your wife? It's not often a man has his wedding night.

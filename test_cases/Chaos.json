It's the study of phenomena that appear random, but in fact have an element of regularity which can be described mathematically. \nCONNERS (confused) Try that again? \nDEKKER Pretty much... initial state of events may seem unrelated and random, but eventually patterns emerge and in the end all the pieces fit together. \nThe Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check. \nWAITRESS Anything else, officers? \nCONNERS That'll be all.

An average day produces about 400 pages, give or take. Today, there were over 3,000 pages. \nDEKKER Meaning? \nDAX We've just witnessed the largest heist in history. Somewhere in the neighborhood of a billion dollars. \nDEKKER Come again? \nDAX It's a computer virus. \"The Computer Virus.\" It randomly withdraws money from all the accounts and deposits it into the bad guys' account. If you check the transactions, no two withdrawal amounts are the same and none of'em are over $100. Most security systems work on the size of the money, not number of transactions. Wire out one million from a handful of accounts and red flags go up. Wire out a less than a hundred from ten million accounts, no flags. \nDEKKER Where's the money now? \nDAX I tried following one of the transactions. It took me an hour and when I finally had it... It went away. \nDEKKER How is that possible? \nDAX The virus created a host of phantom accounts where the money goes (MORE) \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004             82. \nDAX (cont'd) temporarily, then transfers to another account, then to another. It's never in one place long enough to get an accurate fix. \nDEKKER It's still moving the money around? \nDAX Yeah. Any deposit or withdrawal from any bank doesn't usually go into affect until the next business day. So it's going to keep jumping around until it clears at 9 AM tomorrow. \nDEKKER (realizes) Or 6 AM Pacific time. Sunrise. So why break in? If they're just wiring money? Couldn't they do that from anywhere? \nDAX That's the regional manager's computer terminal. There's no outside/remote access to it. There you have unlimited entry to the bank's mainframe. No passwords to work around, no \"hacking\" in. It's all nice and clean. \nDEKKER A billion dollars is missing and we're only discovering this now? \nDAX Ironically, when the power went out, it helped hide the virus and bought it time to work. \nDEKKER So they weren't trying to make   it look like they were robbing a bank,   to rip off a Saudi Prince? They were    making it look like they ripped off a   Saudi Prince to rob a bank. (realizes) The Chaos Theory. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n152   EXT.

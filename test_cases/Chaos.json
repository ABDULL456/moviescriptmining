PEARL STREET BRIDGE- NIGHT                               A1 \nCLOSE ON...   A BRONZE PLAQUE which reads, \"PEARL STREET BRIDGE.\" \nON THE BRIDGE... RAIN POURS DOWN. An SUV steers out of control and CRASHES into a STALLED OUT VEHICLE. \nIt's quiet NOW, EXCEPT FOR THE INCESSANT pounding rain.    IN THE DISTANCE, police lights approach. \nSMASH CUT TO: \n1    EXT.   PEARL STREET BRIDGE - NIGHT                              1 \nTHROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... The image is GRAINY and FRENETIC. A HEAVY RAIN POURS DOWN on a MELEE OF ACTIVITY. \nPOLICE CARS block either end, their LIGHTS ignite the sky in a dizzying RED and BLUE design. The attention centers on... \nThe SUV and the CRASHED VEHICLE lay in the middle of the bridge. A MAN, 30's, madness on his face, his right hand holds a HOSTAGE, a woman, 20's, racked with fear, tight to his body. His left holds a GUN! \nTwo DETECTIVES, slowly approach the Man.   ONLY SEE THE DETECTIVES FROM BEHIND. \nA News Reporter, KAREN CROSS, 30's, blond with energy to burn, shields herself from the rain, steps in front of the camera... \nKAREN CROSS ... Police on scene are approaching the suspect. They're at the center of the Bridge now. \nThe Man waves his gun wildly, screams at the Detectives.     The Hostage, tears streaming down her face, SCREAMS OUT! \nFADE TO BLACK. \nSUDDENLY...   THREE GUN SHOTS, almost simultaneously, RING OUT! \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004         2. \nKAREN CROSS (OS) We have shots fired. Shots have been fired... Both the suspect and his hostage are down... Police are moving in... Oh my God. \nFADE IN: \n2    INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                 2 \nA loft apartment, scarcely furnished, except for BOOKS, HUNDREDS OF THEM, fill stacks of shelves. Hearing but not watching the television, METICULOUSLY preparing a GIN AND TONIC, is... \nDETECTIVE QUENTIN CONNERS, a grizzled, intense veteran. His charisma, which he has in spades, gets him into as much trouble as it gets him out of. At present a somber mood. The shadows from the rain stream down Conners's face. \nIN THE GLASS'S REFLECTION... The TV Report plays. (NOTE: most of, if not all, of the TV report will in reflection.) \nKAREN CROSS (OS) After a two month investigation, Det. Jason York has been relieved of duty for his role in the Pearl Street Bridge shooting deaths of Lisa ReAnn and John Curtis. Key testimony against York came from Det. Bernard Callo, who was on scene that night. The Seattle Police Department is handing this case over to the King County District Attorney's office. Criminal charges are expected. \n3    ON A TELEVISION SCREEN--                                       3 \nThe IMAGE cuts to an earlier interview with... CAPTAIN MARTIN JENKINS, 50's, chronically tired and unsympathetic. \nJENKINS In a civilized society, the men and women entrusted with serving and protecting the community are to be held accountable just like everyone else. Simply put... Just because you are a cop, doesn't mean laws don't apply to you. This is no longer the wild, wild west. \n3A   EXT.   KING COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY (THROUGH TV CAMERA)      3A \nKAREN CROSS stands on the steps, a PHOTO of Conners appears. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004            3. \nKAREN CROSS This same review board last week found Quentin Conners, Det. York's partner, \"not responsible\" for the same shooting. He remains on suspension without pay. \n3B   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CONNERS APARTMENT - NIGHT                    3B \nConners turns off the TV, lays the remote next to a PHOTO of Conners and a YOUNG WOMAN (TEDDY) during happy times. He stares at the photo, finishes his drink. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nEND OPENING CREDITS. \n4    EXT.   SEATTLE - DAY - ESTABLISHING                               4 \nA COOL, CRISP Pacific Northwestern day. MOUNT RAINIER looms in the distance. The SPACE NEEDLE overlooks downtown. While the sun shines now, the OVERCAST SKY on the horizon FORESHADOWS AN IMPENDING STORM. In the heart of the city... \n5    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                               5 \nAn IMPRESSIVE STRUCTURE on a BUSY CITY CORNER. TRAFFIC, street and pedestrian, go about their business. \nACROSS THE STREET...   A BLACK TRUCK screeches to a stop. \nLorenz nods. \n10B   INT.   THE LOBBY--                                           10B \nBLACK CLAD #1 flips the \"BANK CLOSED\" sign around. \n11    INT.   MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY                                       11 \nJenkins fastens his cufflinks.   In the bed behind him... \nHEATHER \"TEDDY\" GALLOWAY, 30's, normally a force to reckon with, appears vulnerable with only a sheet wrapped around her. \nJENKINS Have you seen my watch? \nTeddy gestures to the night stand. Jenkins retrieves the watch. He also slides his WEDDING RING back on. This ain't love, this is a relationship of convenience. \nJenkins slips on his jacket, secures his tie and, after one last check in the mirror... \nJENKINS This was fun. You should get out of bed. You'll be late for work. \nAnd with that, Jenkins exits. Teddy waits for the door to close, then collapses back onto the bed. \n12    INT.   SAFETY DEPOSIT VAULT - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK             12 \nPLASTIC EXPLOSIVES line the walls, connect all the safety deposit boxes together! BLACK CLAD #2, takes cover, readies the detonation device and... \nBLACK CLAD #2 (into his headset) Fire in the hole. \nHe FLIPS A SWITCH and... KA-BOOM!    AN EXPLOSION RIPS THROUGH THE VAULT! \n13    INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                            13 \nA PILLOW OF SMOKE BLOWS into the lobby! Lorenz stands UNFLINCHING. The explosion was expected. \nBEHIND THE CUSTOMER SERVICE WINDOWS-- \nAn EAGER TELLER, 30's, seizes the moment.    He reaches up and PRESSES THE SILENT ALARM BUTTON! \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004         7. \nBLACK CLAD #4 turns just in time to see it, quickly FIRES his weapon! The Eager Teller slumps against the wall, BLEEDS profusely from his neck, not dead yet. \nLorenz hustles over to Black Clad #4. \nLORENZ What do you think you're doing? \nBLACK CLAD #4 Fucker pushed the alarm. \nLorenz GLARES DISGUSTEDLY at his accomplice. \nLORENZ It would've made more sense to shoot him before he pushes the fucking alarm. Not after. (looks at the Eager Teller) Jesus. \nLorenz levels, very calmly, his weapon at the Eager Teller's head and... \nLORENZ And... If you're going to do something. (FIRES his weapon!) Do it right. \nThe Eager's Teller's body keels over, dead.    Lorenz checks his watch... 9:26 a.m. \nLORENZ (into microphone) Alarm's tripped. We're on a clock. (to Black Clad #4) Get these people out of the way. \nA14   EXT.   MOTEL - DAY - ESTABLISHING                              A14 \nThe Four Seasons it ain't. \n14    INT.   SHOWER/ MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY                             14 \nThere's not enough soap on the planet for Teddy to feel clean. Doubt and fear present on her face. She turns off the water, and steps out... when she does HER PAGER, off screen, chimes! \n15    INT.   MOTEL BEDROOM - DAY                                      15 \nTeddy, a towel wrapped around her, picks up the pager.   The number: 911. She picks up the TELEPHONE, dials. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004             8. \nTEDDY (beat, then) This is Detective Galloway. \n16    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                                16 \nSIRENS BLARE... POLICE CARS brake hard, blocking traffic. OFFICERS fly out, shotguns out! \nHELICOPTERS circle. NEWS VANS speed onto the scene as the CROWDS builds. Standing in the center of things... \nDETECTIVE BERNIE CALLO, 40's, a stern, by-the-book cop. Not a popular member of the force. TWO OFFICERS, 30's, follow him. \nCALLO (into his radio) I want all points of entry identified and covered. We need SWAT here now. Have emergency crews standing by! \nOFFICER AT BANK (re: the Media) Didn't take them long. \nCALLO Set a perimeter.    Move'em back. \nDEKKER Because people's lives are at stake. That takes priority over your ego. \nCONNERS (to Jenkins; re: Dekker) You may want to put a leash on him. (beat; thinks) Saying I did want to help... I'm still suspended or did that slip your mind? \nJENKINS The commissioner's office has ordered me to reinstate you. As of now, you're back on the force. \nCONNERS Just like that? \nJENKINS Just like that. (beat) I won't, however, unleash you alone. \nCONNERS Always a catch. \nJENKINS Shane, here, is your new partner. Consider him a younger version of me, looking over your shoulder, watching every move you make. \nThe idea of a new partner doesn't sit well with Conners. \nJENKINS Don't think I endorse this. If it were my call, you'd be with your partner... \nCONNERS You mean ex-partner. \nJENKINS ... On the unemployment line with him. \nCONNERS For a moment there, I thought you cared. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004          12. \nJENKINS I care about those innocent people down there. I hope to God someone hasn't made a monumental mistake letting you back in. \nCONNERS I appreciate the words of encouragement and the confidence you have in me. I look forward to the continuing, positive relationship we've shared in the past. \n21   OMIT (COMBINED INTO SC. 20)                                      21 \n22   OMIT                                                             22 \n23   OMIT                                                             23 \n24   OMIT                                                             24 \n25   OMIT                                                             25 \n26   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 10:27 AM - DAY                   26 \nPOLICE CORRAL the ever-growing group of SPECTATORS. \nA SWAT TRUCK pulls up, the BACK DOORS FLY OPEN!     SWAT exit in a flurry, race into position. \nAmidst the commotion... JENKINS' CAR navigates the scene, stops next to... KAREN CROSS immediately recognizes Conners, orders her CAMERAMAN to center on him. \nConners, Dekker and Jenkins climb out of the car, head towards the crime scene, when... \nKAREN CROSS Detective Conners? Detective, can we have a few words? \nConners turns, recognizes Karen.    Relishing the moment... \nCONNERS I'll give you two... (pauses for effect) Blow me. If you need a follow-up comment let me know? (to Dekker) Cunt made her career off me. \nAT THE POLICE TECH VAN-- \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004         13. \nConners, Dekker and Jenkins arrive, FIND Teddy, her hair still wet, with her partner, DET. VINCENT DURANO, 40's, a middle of the road, never out on a limb type cop. \nCallo looks on, the RAGE boiling inside of him. \nCONNERS Teddy, Vincent... (completely ignores Callo) ... Nice to see you both. \nJENKINS Conners has been reinstated to full active duty. It's his scene. \nThis info comes as a surprise.   Especially to Callo. \nCALLO The last hostage situation this guy headed, an innocent civilian died. \nCONNERS I was not responsible... \nCALLO You never are. That girl would be alive today if it weren't for your cowboy antics. You destroy lives. \nCONNERS Fuck you. Look who's talking about destroying lives. \nJENKINS Decision's been made, Bernie. \nCALLO I was first on scene and I have seniority. (pleads) Don't do this, Martin. \nJENKINS We'll talk about it later.   Take a hike. \nCALLO (beat) Fine. I'll watch this train wreck from home. \nCallo exits. \nCONNERS (sarcastic) I'm going to miss him. \nCONNERS What else will I be looking for? \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          17. \nLORENZ Demands... Probably too much to ask for you and your colleagues to pack up and go home? \nCONNERS Safe to say. \nLORENZ Stay by the phone.    I'll contact you shortly. \nCONNERS Lorenz... \nLORENZ Don't worry, I have no plans until sunrise tomorrow, so hunker down. It's going to be a long one. \nCONNERS Wait, we're talking here... \nLORENZ Patience, Detective. We don't want another Pearl Street Bridge, do we? \nConners's thrown by the mention of Pearl Street Bridge. Lorenz abruptly HANGS UP. \nDAX He's off. \n30   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                             30 \nTHE CROWDS GROW. The MEDIA BUILD UP INTENSIFIES.    THROUGH A TELEVISION CAMERA... Karen Cross reports: \nKAREN CROSS This standoff is approaching two hours now. We've been told Detectives have made contact with the perpetrators inside the bank. Whether any specific demands have been made, we cannot confirm. As soon as we know something, we'll pass it on to you. Reporting live, Karen Cross, channel two news. \nCAMERAMAN (OS) We're clear. \nKAREN CROSS Who the hell writes this shit? \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          18. \n30A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                       30A \nBlack Clad #1 and #4 remove from their bag - ropes, pulleys, an iron spike and hammer. #1 also removes... a spear-gun. \n#1 connects the rope to a spear. FIRES the spear into the wall above the bank's front windows! He snags a 2nd spear, repeats. \n31    POLICE TECH VAN--                                               31 \nThe Detectives huddle.   Impatience level high. \nCONNERS (to Dax) Try again. \nDAX He's not picking up. \nCONNERS (stern) Try again. \nDax, humbled, does as ordered. \nCONNERS (glances about) Where's our fearless Captain? \nDEKKER Went uptown to brief the Commissioner. \nCONNERS So you're here in his place. \nConners fumbles with the wrapper, but eventually sticks another piece of gum in his mouth. Teddy notices. \nCONNERS Nicotine gum. \nTEDDY (shock) You quit smoking? \nCONNERS Caffeine, too, if you must know. (Another shock) What? A man's capable of change. \nTEDDY A man, yes. You...     I'm not so sure. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004           19. \nCONNERS Don't worry, I still have a vice or two. \nDAX Fifteen rings.    No answer. \nCONNERS Try again in five. \nTEDDY What are they doing in there? \nVINCENT Wasting our time. \nTime. The word rings in Conners's head.     He starts to put it together. \nCONNERS Precisely. He knows police protocol, not to mention the shit in our own precinct. He's disguising his voice, means he's got a record and has done this before. He's heavily armed and well-connected. He knows he's surrounded. He hasn't asked for a damned thing. He drops that hint about sunrise, prepping us for a long wait. He's buying time. Why? \nVINCENT (brainstorming) To figure out his next move.    He wasn't expecting us. \nDEKKER No, he wasn't expecting you. He said, he thought you were still suspended. \nCONNERS Probably thought it would take the whole day for you to find me. Giving him the time he needs. \nLORENZ They're comin'. \n34 A   IN THE LOBBY--                                                 34 A \nBlack Clad #1 and #4 drag the TWO RANDOM HOSTAGES, KICKING AND SCREAMING, towards the anchor/pulley! \nRANDOM HOSTAGE #1 What are you doing?! Let me go! \n#1 & #4 fasten the Hostages to ropes connected to the pulleys! \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          23. \n35   EXT.   FRONT ENTRANCE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY            35 \nBehind a barricade, Conners crouches down beside Dekker and his SWAT Team. \nCONNERS (into radio) Let's go around the horn. \n36   ON THE WEST SIDE--                                              36 \nTeddy, Vincent and a SWAT Team... \nTEDDY One, check. \n37   OMIT                                                            37 \n38   ON THE EAST SIDE--                                              38 \nThe SWAT Commander and his team... \nSWAT COMMANDER Two, check. \n39   ROOFTOP #1--                                                    39 \nA SNIPER holds his eye to the scope. \nSNIPER #1 Three, check. \n40   ROOFTOP #2--                                                    40 \nSNIPER #2 Four, check. \n41   AT THE MAIN ENTRANCE--                                          41 \nConners glances at his watch... \nCONNERS Here we go... Cut the power. \n42   INT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                   42 \nInstantly...   EVERYTHING BLACKS OUT!   LIGHTS, COMPUTERS, etc. \nTHE HOSTAGES grab each other TIGHTLY.   PANIC evident.   Lorenz and the Black Clad calmly react. \n43   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                                   43 \nConners makes the call... \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004          24. \nCONNERS Doors! \nEach Team makes their move, when... \n44    INT.

LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                           45A \nBlack Clad #3 FLIPS A SWITCH. Suddenly, a canister attached to the pulleys race up the ropes! The HOSTAGES have their feet yanked out from under them, then shoot INTO THE AIR! \nThey SMASH THROUGH A GLASS HANDRAIL ON THE SECOND FLOOR, then... \n45B   EXT.   MAIN ENTRANCE - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY             45B \nSHOOT to the TOP OF THE WALL-LENGTH WINDOWS! They hang, dangle helplessly! On FULL DISPLAY for the outside to see! \nDEKKER (looking up at the windows) Holy shit...?! \n55    A BANK CORRIDOR--                                              55 \nDekker leads his group. His heart POUNDING THROUGH HIS CHEST. His Gun up and ready. Suddenly... \nA NOISE up ahead... He bares down, takes a DEEP BREATH, carefully proceeds until... Teddy and Vincent emerge. Teddy EXHALES, lowers her weapon. So does Dekker. \n55A   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                        55A \nConners strides out from behind the counters... \nCONNERS (to Vincent) See anyone come your way? \nVINCENT No.   No one went by me. \nThe SWAT COMMANDER approaches holding a couple of the BLACK MASKS, some BLACK BODY ARMOR. \nSWAT COMMANDER Detectives... We found these. \nConners takes one of the masks in his hands. \nCONNERS We let them walk right past us. \nDekker, Teddy, the SWAT Commander, Officers, Vincent and the SWAT Team stand in the middle of the lobby, STUNNED. Conners, his anger SIMMERS TO A BOIL, until finally... \nCONNERS SHIT! \nTIME CUT TO: \n56    EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - 11:48 AM - DAY                 56 \nAn OFFICER unfurls a FRESH ROLL of \"POLICE: CAUTION\" TAPE around the scene. Still mayhem, but gradually coming under control. \nPolice interview HOSTAGES, so do REPORTERS. PARAMEDICS administer oxygen. Two CORONERS load the EAGER TELLER's body into their truck. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004        28. \n57   INT.   LOBBY - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                         57 \nVincent, covered in debris, confers with Conners. \nVINCENT We got the one Teller dead, the two that were strung up are alive, but in critical condition. A few SWAT incurred 2nd degree burns, but that's the worst of it. Now, depending on who you talk to... there was anywhere from five to nine perps. And nobody got a good look at any of'em, wore their masks the whole time. Dax is rounding up the security tapes now. That should give us a firm number. \nCONNERS I want background checks on every hostage. They're all suspects until they're not. \nVINCENT You don't think one of them's still here? \nCONNERS After this, nothing would surprise me. \n58   EXT.   TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                58 \nDax pulls cables, power cords, etc., getting set to go inside with them. Dekker approaches. \nDEKKER Excuse me... I need to listen to the conversation between Lorenz and Conners again? \nDAX It'll have to wait. \nDEKKER How long? \nDAX Hour.   Maybe more. \nDEKKER (too long) Show me how to play it myself? \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004        29. \nDAX Look, this isn't how it works. I don't take orders from you. I don't know you and NO ONE touches my stuff. You're going to have to wait. \nDax gets his shit, starts to go. Dekker waits, then proceeds into the van. Dax turns, notices. \n59   INT.   TECH VAN                                              59 \nDekker inspects the equipment, when... \nDAX What the hell are you doing? \nDEKKER Along with whatever they stole and this war zone they left behind... A man's dead, and the killers are running free. I don't have time to wait. (looks at the equipment) I'll figure it out. Thanks for your help. \nDAX (relents, demonstrates) Here. This DAT machine. Play, stop, rewind... It's just like using a tape player. Headphones are jacked in. Tape's already inside. \nDEKKER Thank you. \n60   EXT.   AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY                          60 \nA CAR PULLS UP... Jenkins steps out. Stares out over the scene, the mess. He's a volcano ready to erupt. \n61   INT.   SECURITY ROOM - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK                61 \nA SERIES OF EIGHT BLACK AND WHITE VIDEO MONITORS... as we rewind. SEVEN of the eight show recorded images of the bank. The eighth shows only STATIC. Dax sits in front of the monitors. Conners stands nearby. \nCONNERS (re: the eighth monitor) What's with this one? \nCONNERS Depends, are we talking about your sex life? Because I've heard shortcomings. \nJENKINS You got played, Quentin. Congratulations, you just topped Pearl Street Bridge. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004        33. \nTEDDY That's not fair. It was by the book. Everything was according to standard procedure. \nJenkins ignores Teddy. \nCONNERS You came to me. I didn't ask for this. \nJENKINS Commissioner's office is scrambling to cover their ass. They need a scapegoat... And I have zero problems serving you up. \nCONNERS You wanted this to happen. \nJENKINS No. But if it had to happen to somebody. \nJenkins exits. \n64A   EXT.   AT THE TECH VAN - AMERICAN NATIONAL BANK - DAY      64A \nConners approaches... \nDEKKER I think this Lorenz was trying to tell us something. \nCONNERS You don't say. \nDEKKER The way he spoke... he paused before certain words. Have you ever heard of the Chaos Theory? \nCONNERS What? \n65    INT.   DINER NEAR THE BANK - DAY                               65 \nA grade \"B\" rating, tops.   CUSTOMERS dine, choke down coffee. \nAT A BOOTH-- \nEmpty plates and crumpled napkins litter the table. Conners finishes a cup of coffee, enjoys a slice of pie. Dekker, all about work, goes over his notes. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004             34. \nDEKKER Edward Lorenz invented the Chaos Theory in the 1960's. It's the study of phenomena that appear random, but in fact have an element of regularity which can be described mathematically. \nCONNERS (confused) Try that again? \nDEKKER Pretty much... initial state of events may seem unrelated and random, but eventually patterns emerge and in the end all the pieces fit together. \nThe Waitress refills Conners' coffee, lays down the check. \nWAITRESS Anything else, officers? \nCONNERS That'll be all. (to Dekker) You're a College boy. Which one? Someplace I've heard of or one of those inbred state schools no one's heard of? \nDEKKER U Dub. \nCONNERS Not exactly Princeton, but not bad. How did you end up on the force? \nDEKKER It's kind of the family business. \nCONNERS Family business? What, your Dad, Dad's Dad and so on and so back? \nDekker squirms when it comes to revealing personal info. \nDEKKER Do we really need all this \"get to know you\" crap? Couple hours ago you didn't give a shit. \nCONNERS You've grown on me. Besides, I am entrusting my life to you. I should know something about you. I would (MORE) \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                    MARCH 15, 2004          35. \nCONNERS (cont'd) think you'd like to know a little something about me. \nDEKKER I know about you, Detective.      Everyone does. \nCONNERS You don't say that with much enthusiasm. \nDEKKER Not much to be enthusiastic about. \nConners reaches his limit.      Time to put him in place. \nCONNERS Listen, my reputation often proceeds me. You, however, have no reputation; a fact I need to deal with. After you've been through the shit I have, then you can judge me. Now... we can try to work together, make the best of a bad situation or we can compare Dick sizes all day... Up to you. But since this is your first day here... today... mine's bigger. \nVINCENT (VO) (over radio) Conners, come in? \nBoth men hold steely stares on one another.     Until... \nCONNERS (into radio) Go. \nVINCENT (VO) Got something you'll want to see. \nDekker lowers his head.    Disappointed. \nCONNERS You sure that's what you want? \nGINA Yeah. \nCONNERS Fine. Then it's two phone calls I'll make. The first will be to the public defender's office. The second to children's services. \nGINA What? \nSuddenly Gina's bravado disappears.    Suddenly a scared and lonely girl. \nCONNERS It's simple... if you insist on a lawyer, I take your kids. \nGINA No. \nCONNERS Not like you cared about them anyway. You were ready to fly the coop with \"Shit-for-brains.\" \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004      49. \nGINA No.   You can't do that. \nCONNERS I can and I will. \nGINA Don't. \nCONNERS Tell me what I want to know! \nDekker stares incredulously at Conners. \nGINA (broken) I don't know anything.     Please don't take my kids. Please. \nConners stares into Gina's eyes. She's telling the truth. Conners wraps his coat around Gina's shoulders. \nCONNERS Get her some coffee...     Something hot. \n84   INT.   BULLPEN - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - DAY             84 \nDekker and Conners... \nDEKKER You believe her? \nCONNERS I think for the first time in that girl's life she's telling the truth. \nDEKKER You had to know, once she asked for a lawyer anything she told us would have been inadmissable. \nCONNERS Who would've known? It would've been my word against hers. Who do you think the jury would've believed? \nDEKKER Justice by any means.    Even if you cross the line. \nCONNERS The only line around here is the `blue line', you cross that one, then you got (MORE) \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004         50. \nCONNERS (cont'd) problems. Ask Callo, he knows what I'm talking about. \nTeddy enters, hands Conners a sheet of paper with: \"EVIDENCE: ITEM #4958378\" scribbled on it. \nTEDDY Those serial numbers Marnie faxed me... According to our computers, that money should be downstairs. \n85   INT.   EVIDENCE ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT                85 \nOccupies almost the entire basement of the police station.      A STEEL CAGE protects the contents. \nAT THE FRONT COUNTER-- \nConners and Dekker wait. No one's working at present. Dekker peers inside, anxiously looking for someone. \nDekker RINGS the service bell. \nFinally... HARRY HUME, 50's, the cop on watch, limps to the desk. Crotchety, with an overgrown belly, Frank's seen better days. There's no love loss between Harry and Conners. \nCONNERS (cold) Buzz us in. \nHARRY (colder) You gotta sign first. \nConners and Dekker scribble their signatures down. \nHARRY I heard you were back. Kinda liked not having you around, Conners. \nHarry takes the clipboard, examines it until satisfied.   Then reluctantly BUZZES them in. \nCONNERS Have another donut, Frankie. \nDekker and Conners proceed inside. They walk ALONG THE VAST ROWS OF EVIDENCE, scan the shelves, checking the number. \nCONNERS That fat fuck is the sole guardian of the city's biggest source of contraband. Drugs. Weapons. Cash.

Conners, Teddy and Dekker are led around by a UNIFORMED OFFICER... \nOFFICER AT CALLO HOUSE Wife came home approximately forty-five minutes ago. Found him here. None of the neighbors heard anything. There's no forced entry and no one saw anyone fleeing the scene. \nVincent enters from the basement carrying a LARGE BOX. \nVINCENT Blueprints from the bank, schematics, pictures... Also, about a dozen internet articles on the Saudi Prince. Found it behind the furnace. \nConners nods. \nDEKKER Well, that's it, right? \nSuddenly... THE HOUSE TELEPHONE RINGS! Everyone peers around. After the second ring, the ANSWERING MACHINE PICKS UP... \nCALLO (VO) You've reached the Callo residence.   No one can get to the phone right now. Please leave a message. \nThen...   After the TONE... \nLORENZ (VO) (from the machine) Detective Conners... Are you there? \nConners and everyone turns, listens. \nINTERCUT WITH: \n89   INT.   DARK BEDROOM - NIGHT                                    89 \nLorenz stares ahead, transfixed by something. \nLORENZ Are you connecting the dots? Are you putting it together? Is the pattern emerging? They wouldn't punish you, but I will. \nConners GRABS the phone... \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                    MARCH 15, 2004         55. \nLORENZ Vengeance will be mine, Detective. \nCONNERS Then come and get me you piece of shit. \nLorenz smiles, hangs up.   He resumes staring at the wall in front of him. \nREVEAL: HUNDREDS OF PHOTOGRAPHS, NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS - ALL OF CONNERS - DECORATE THE WALL! \n90   EXT.   BERNIE CALLO'S HOME - DAY                                 90 \nDekker leans back against the car, Conners approaches... \nCONNERS What they told Callo was the plan and what the plan really was may be two different things. Clearly this wasn't part of a plan Callo would've agreed with. \nDEKKER You'd think a cop would be smarter. \nCONNERS As cops we come across every temptation in the book. Money, drugs, power. We'd all like to think we can resist any urge, but... We're not saints. \nDEKKER So, Callo was involved and now they're dragging you into it. Why? \nCONNERS Man said he wanted vengeance. \nDEKKER Piss anyone off lately? \nCONNERS Me? \nBoth can't help but smile.      Jenkins walks up. \nJENKINS I just got off the phone with Agent Doyle. After the Charlotte break in, the Prince withdrew all his possessions from every safe deposit box in this country. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004       56. \nDEKKER Let me get this straight, they didn't touch the cash or the safe deposit boxes. So, they... break into a bank, blow it up, and steal nothing? (to Conners) Still make sense to you? \nCONNERS Nothing about today makes sense. \nDekker watches as BERNIE CALLO's body is loaded into the Coroner's vehicle. Teddy assists MRS. CALLO into a police car. Vincent carries the box of evidence from the home. \nDekker's mind works overtime, then... \nDEKKER \"Return to the earth now if your mind is troubled and your heart is uncertain. For it is by returning to the beginning that we can clearly see the path.\" \nConners and Jenkins share a confused look. \nCONNERS (to Jenkins) Don't look at me, he's your find. \nJENKINS Say that again, Detective? \nDEKKER We go back to where this all started. We go to the bank. \n91     EXT.   SEATTLE - 6:08 PM - NIGHT                              91 \nThe sun SINKS below the horizon. \nITALIAN HOST (confused) He's your brother? \nCONNERS No. \nITALIAN HOST No matter, no matter...     I bring you bottle of house wine! \nDEKKER We're still on duty.     No wine. \nITALIAN HOST (insulted) No wine? \nCONNERS A little wine. \nITALIAN HOST That's better. \nThey get to the table, Conners looks at it. \nCONNERS Last time I was here, you said that table in the corner was the \"best in the house.\" \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004        60. \nITALIAN HOST It was. Anywhere you sit becomes best table in house. Now relax, I bring you food. \n95   LATER, STILL AT THE RESTAURANT--                               95 \nA PIANO PLAYER recreates the sweet sounds of Italy.   PATRONS sing along. Eating, drinking and being merry. \nAT THE DETECTIVE'S TABLE-- \nVincent and Teddy have joined Conners and Dekker. A MOUNTAIN OF FOOD still remains. A COUPLE BOTTLES OF WINE have been consumed, empty plates and basket rolls spread about. The mood is happy, light. Not thinking about their day. \nConners tells an anecdote, something that Teddy and Vincent have heard before, but don't care. Dekker watches the Detectives, admires in their closeness. \nCONNERS Shane, what was that thing you said back at the house about \"returning to the beginning path\" or something? \nDEKKER It's a Buddhist story. \nCONNERS We're all ears. \nDEKKER One day the Buddha found his heart in turmoil. So he retreats to the forest, to the earth, to the base of a great tree and, I'm paraphrasing, but... this elephant comes up and tells Buddha he doesn't like seeing him discouraged. \nTEDDY He can talk to an elephant? \nDEKKER He's the Buddha. He's attained the 6th level of consciousness. He's capable of communicating with plants, trees... even rocks. \nVINCENT Rocks? \nDEKKER You asked. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004         61. \nCONNERS Continue. \nDEKKER The Buddha was troubled so he went back to where he came from, the beginning, to find the path, the answer. So when you hit a dead end, go back to the beginning to find your way. Or something like that. \nCONNERS We have a genuine philosopher in our midst. \nVINCENT You're a Buddhist? \nDEKKER No. Just something I picked up along the way. \nTEDDY But you're religious? \nDEKKER Not particularly. \nConners stares curiously at his new partner.   Then excuses himself to go to the men's room. \nDEKKER You're all pretty tight. \nTEDDY We've been through a lot together. \nDEKKER I guess I just thought... I don't know. With all the trouble he's been in lately, coming back from suspension, everyone would treat him differently. \nVINCENT You can't believe what you read or see on TV. If anything, our tie to Conners is stronger. He's one of the best. Even when things got pretty wild today and everyone else panicked, he was in control. That doesn't just happen. He's just that good. \nTEDDY Excuse me. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004          62. \nTeddy heads for the ladies room. \nVINCENT What was the Buddha looking for? \nDEKKER The divine in himself. \nArt's confused.    Dekker's cellphone rings. \nDEKKER How long does it usually take to for fingerprints to be ID'd? \nVINCENT Hours, maybe days.    We could be waiting a while. \n104   INT.   FRONT HALL - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                     104 \nTHE FRONT DOOR KICKS IN! Dekker and Conners cautiously enter. They move the way veteran partners would. No indications that these two just met today. \nThe House is almost PITCH BLACK. \nConners motions that he's going up, signals for Dekker to take the back of the house. \n105   INT.   KITCHEN - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                        105 \nDekker proceeds inside.   After a scan, the kitchen's clean. \n106   INT.   UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT               106 \nConners emerges from the stairway. \n107   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    107 \nDekker steps from the back hallway into the DARKENED living room. Eyes straight ahead and sharp. What he doesn't see... \nLORENZ STEPS FROM THE DARKNESS. \n108   INT.   COMPUTER ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                  108 \nConners moves from the hall, into the bedroom where he finds... Chris's dead Body. He checks for a pulse when he notices... \nON THE MONITOR... Conners sees A SHADOWY FIGURE BEHIND Dekker! \n109   INT.   LIVING ROOM - CHRIS'S HOUSE - NIGHT                    109 \nDekker, oblivious to Lorenz's presence, continues on.    Heads for the front hallway. \nLorenz raises his gun, narrows his sites on Dekker. \nSimultaneously... CONNERS DIVES, TACKLES DEKKER BEHIND the living room wall -- LORENZ OPENS FIRE, UNLOADS A FULL CLIP! \nA BULLET GRAZES DEKKER'S SHOULDER!    THE REST LITTER THE WALLS, BLOW APART A MIRROR! \nConners and Dekker, behind the wall, regroup. Conners RETALIATES. FIRES FOUR ROUNDS AT LORENZ, but... \n110   OMIT                                                          110 \n111   OMIT                                                          111 \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                   MARCH 15, 2004          66. \n112    EXT.

JEROME KNIGHT, 50's. \nJENKINS He's also the brother of John Curtis, the perp Conners shot at Pearl Street Bridge. (Moving on) Richards testifies that he was hired by Curtis to pull the bank job with a dirty cop on the inside, Bernie Callo. Curtis hoped that Conners would take the fall for American National turning ugly, disgracing him even further. We also have the names of two more accomplices, Lamar Galt and Xander Harrington.

Doesn't matter what Curtis told Galt and Harrington, he's going to finish them off tonight. \n122   I/E    CONNERS'S CAR/ CITY STREETS - NIGHT - TRAVELLING          122 \nConners drives, Dekker shotgun.      Conners more intense than normal. \nCONNERS You never think of the repercussions. The suspect's mother, father... Brother. How your decision affects them.

Never made sense to me. \nCONNERS So why become a cop? \nDEKKER Finish what he started. Every day he went out, trying to do some good. Help the people who couldn't help themselves, just give'em a chance is what he always said. Didn't always work out right, but he tried. You tried to help save that girl on the bridge. If you weren't there, the girl still would've died. She had a chance because you were there. That's all we can do. \n125     EXT.

DEKKER ROLLS AWAY! THE PIKE POLE BREAKS A WOODEN PLANK TO PIECES, sticks into the ground beneath the water. \nDekker, still tangled in the net, KICKS OUT York's legs.        He falls to the planks. \nYork quickly rebounds. He POUNCES on Dekker, from behind he wraps his arm around Dekker's throat, CHOKING HIM. \nDekker struggles to breathe.    York SQUEEZES harder. \nYORK I have come this far...      I will not be denied. \nDekker fights, arms flailing. He REACHES blindly behind York, grabs a hold of the PIKE POLE. The pole SNAPS in two! \nDekker wildly SWINGS at York who dodges easily. \nYork SLAMS Dekker into the side of the TUG.       Still choking. \nDekker, on his last gasp, PUSHES OFF THE TUG! \nYork stumbles backwards, GETS HIS FOOT CAUGHT IN THE HOLE! He twists, spinning around, falling down onto... \n... THE REMAINING PIKE SPEAR!    The Pike punches through his chest... POPS out his back! \nYork, blood and life escaping him, his eyes find Dekker. Then go dead. \nDekker steps close.

Teddy leans down beside Conners. \nTEDDY You sure you're all right? \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004            43. \nCONNERS I'm fine. \nConners and Teddy share a look, when...   Dekker enters. \nDEKKER Girl's name is Gina Lopez, twenty- eight. Done some time for possession, has two kids... Am I interrupting? \nCONNERS No. \nTEDDY Excuse me. \nTeddy exits. \nDEKKER Gina claims she doesn't know anything about a bank robbery. \nCONNERS Of course she doesn't.   Vincent! \nVincent trudges out of the kitchen. \nCONNERS Have'em put Ms. Lopez in interrogation one and turn the A/C on full. Leave her alone and cold. Let me know when her nipples can cut glass. \nVINCENT Will do. (To Dekker) Detective... I didn't realize when we first met who you were. I worked with your father. It was only for a brief time when I first got outta the academy, but it was an honor. \nCONNERS (surprised) Your father was Harry Dekker? \nVINCENT I wish it could've been for longer. \nDEKKER Thanks. \nVincent exits. Conners looks at Dekker in a new light. Dekker starts away, until... \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004            44. \nCONNERS (new subject) That was some fancy riding.    You have a bike? \nDEKKER Used to, but I sold it. (shows his scrape on his arm) They're dangerous. \nMARNIE ROLLINS, 20's, a CSI OFFICER, wears gloves, pokes her head in the room. \nMARNIE Detectives. Ready for you. \n80   THE BEDROOM--                                                    80 \nTWO LARGE SUITCASES rest OPEN on the bed.   Marnie prepares a report. \nCONNERS Somebody going on a trip? \nMARNIE Looks like it, don't it? \nCONNERS Marnie, you're looking well. \nMARNIE Heard you were back, Conners... and keep dreaming. \nMarnie gives DEKKER an amorous glance, which he returns. \nMARNIE (to Dekker) You, on the other hand... I gotta bike myself. Maybe we can go for a ride sometime? Or maybe I can just ride you. \nConners looks at both of them. \nCONNERS Can we get back to work? \nMARNIE We got passports, sun tan lotion, Bermuda shorts, thong bikini, hopefully hers and this... \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004       45. \nShe opens a LARGE DUFFEL BAG. Conners and Dekker look inside the bag... It's FULL OF CASH! All denominations. \nDEKKER Must be a fifty large there easy.    His cut? \nMARNIE You'd think, right? \nDEKKER It's not? \nMARNIE Don't put words in my mouth, but... Two things jump out here. First, each bank branch has their own money bands. This is not American National's. After a little checking, it belongs to Pacific Savings of Seattle. \nDEKKER That sounds familiar. \n", "test2_true": "DEKKER (smells the bills; grimaces) What is it? \nMARNIE When evidence is taken in, any physical contact might affect the ability to lift prints, so, to mark it, we now spray a scented solution directly on the bill. \nCONNERS Is that new? \nMARNIE Wave of the future.   Gotta keep up with the times, Conners. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                    MARCH 15, 2004       46. \nDEKKER So this money's not from our bank. \nMARNIE No. This is the money from the Pacific Savings job and our evidence room. (smiling; to Dekker) Now... For a list of things you can put in my mouth. \n81   INT.   HALLWAY - LOWER CLASS APARTMENT - DAY                   81 \nConners and Dekker confer with Teddy and Vincent. \nCONNERS Do you remember who headed up the Pacific Savings case? \nTEDDY I think it was Callo.    Why? \nCONNERS No reason.     Just thinking out loud. \n82   I/E    CONNERS'S CAR/ CITY STREETS - DAY                       82 \nConners and Dekker head back to the police station.   It's quiet between these two, until... \nCONNERS When you said it was your \"family business\" I didn't think... I guess I just didn't connect the dots. \nDEKKER Don't worry about it. \nCONNERS Your father was a hero. \nDEKKER Yes he was. \nCONNERS At first I thought maybe you were related to the Captain. \nDEKKER No.   No relation. \nCONNERS The Captain, he just kind of \"discovered\" you. Through the academy, to excellent evaluation reports, while (MORE) \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004        47. \nCONNERS (cont'd) on the beat, to the high test scores on the detective's exam. \nDEKKER Something like that. \nCONNERS That's how he found me. \nThis surprises Dekker. \nCONNERS Maybe we're not as different as you think. \n83   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT         83 \nA small, cold room with a large mirror along the WEST WALL. \nGina sits at the table, shivering. Her breath visible, so are her nipples through a WHITE, SEATTLE P.D. T-SHIRT. Conners paces around her like a CIRCLING SHARK. Dekker's in the corner, observing. \nCONNERS We found the money. \nGINA That money was Dwayne's... \nCONNERS That money came from our evidence room. \nGINA I told you. I don't know nothing about a bank robbery. Whatever Damon was into, I didn't know! \nCONNERS So, where were you going? \nGINA Vacation. \nCONNERS This isn't possession or solicitation, Gina. This is felony-murder one. You could get life. \nGINA Me!?   I didn't do nothing! \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004          48. \nCONNERS (frustrated) It's \"I didn't do anything.\" \"Didn't do nothing\" is a double negative, infers the positive. The grammar in this country sucks. \nGINA Then I didn't do ANY-thing! \nConners takes a seat next to Gina.    His EYES BURN through her. \nCONNERS This isn't going away. You want to walk out of here, you tell me something... now. \nGINA I swear I don't know. Now I'm done talking. I want a lawyer. \n", "test3_input": "DEKKER Lorenz...    Curtis...   Called me. \nJENKINS He called you? \nDEKKER He said he didn't kill anyone who didn't deserve it. He said Callo was insignificant. But without Callo he wouldn't have had the knowledge of our department and... (grabs a clipboard) ... He wouldn't have had the front money to hire the crew. \nJENKINS He was screwing with your head. Go home, Shane. You did good today. Your Dad would be proud. Get some sleep. There will be more bad guys tomorrow. \nJenkins exits. \nDekker falls back into his chair. Then... discovers... Callo's file... The Property Room Sign-Out Sheet. The signatures. \n154   INT.   INTERROGATION ROOM - SEATTLE P.

This couldn't wait til morning. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                MARCH 15, 2004          85. \nDEKKER (cold) How did he come at you, Harry? It's the only thing that doesn't make sense. \nHARRY What are you talking about? \nDEKKER All day long we thought Callo was the dirty cop. All day long we were wrong. \nDekker slides some papers in front of Harry. \nDEKKER That's the sign-out sheet from the evidence room. Here's one of Callo's reports. Here's another one... and another -- \nThe SIGNATURES ARE DIFFERENT, but Harry doesn't even examine them. He knows. \nDEKKER They're not the same signature, Harry. They're not even close. \nHARRY (shrugs it off) Maybe he had a cramp in his hand.    I don't know. \nDEKKER (re: file #1) This is your file... You were reprimanded, a month ago after you confronted Callo at the courthouse. You punched him. That ring a bell? \nHARRY And I'd do it again. Cops who testify against cops shouldn't be breathing the same air I do. There's a line you don't cross! \nDEKKER So you set him up! You forged Callo's signature, you gave him the money and you helped him with his plan because you thought he got a raw deal at Pearl Street Bridge! Don't deny it, Harry cause I know. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                  MARCH 15, 2004           86. \nHARRY OF COURSE HE GOT A RAW DEAL AT PEARL STREET BRIDGE!

An SUV CRASHES into a STALLED-OUT VEHICLE. \nJOHN CURTIS (THE KIDNAPPER) crawls out of the SUV! He sees cop's lights approaching. He drags LISA REANN (THE VICTIM) out of the truck. A BRIGHT LIGHT (from a helicopter) strikes John in the eyes! \nLIGHTS!   EVERYWHERE BRIGHT!   It's all very BLINDING! \nCOPS block both sides of the bridge!   TV REPORTERS AT EITHER END OF THE BRIDGE! \nJohn holds the gun up to Lisa's head as... OVER JOHN'S SHOULDER...

This is how you want to go out? \nHARRY My conscience is clean. \nDEKKER This has been a very long, trying day. And I'm tired. We're chasing a (MORE) \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                 MARCH 15, 2004          87. \nDEKKER (cont'd) phantom. Just when we have him... he disappears. He's been two steps ahead of Conners and me all day. \nHARRY Of course he has.   Who knows Conners better than him? \n", "test3_true": "Harry goes silent.   Realizes he just let the cat out of the bag. \nDEKKER (realizes) We're not talking about Curtis, are we, Harry? (still no response) Who would know Conners better than anyone? Who would you protect?

Let the girl go. \nJohn PUSHES the barrel of the gun TIGHTER into Lisa's temple. \nYORK That, you don't want to do. \nYork narrows his aim on John Curtis. \nJOHN CURTIS One step closer and the girl dies. \nSHOOTING SCRIPT                     MARCH 15, 2004            88. \nCONNERS Think about this... you kill her, where are you going to... \nSIMULTANEOUSLY...

Should be able to trace his location within 100 meters or less. (into phone) Yeah? (to Dekker) They got him. \n163A   INT.   DAX'S OFFICE - SEATTLE POLICE DEPARTMENT - NIGHT    163A \nDekker and Dax examine a map. \nDAX The signal's coming from around 175th street. That's about fifteen miles north of us. (deflated) From the harbor he can take a boat or a sea-plane out. He's gone. \nDEKKER (beat; thinks) No. If there's a signal. Means he's still here. He's waiting for something or someone. \nDAX Waiting? Where? Ain't nothing down there that's open at this hour. \nDEKKER (thinks) 175th street... There's is one place. \n164    EXT.

CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Well, good luck. Nice to see you. 
VERONICA You too. 
They both steer their carts towards each other in opposite directions but bump right into each other. 
CELESTE Oh sorry! 
VERONICA Oh, it's okay! Bye again. 
100 INT. ROSEN KARAOKE-KOREATOWN- LATER THAT NIGHT 100 
Celeste and Paul are in a private karaoke room. Paul is belting his heart out, singing Boyz II Men, "On Bended Knee." Celeste is loving it. She has her own mike and pipes in once in a while with a harmony. 
PAUL Can somebody tell me how to get things back the way they used to be...oh God give me a reason, I'm down on bended knee..ooohohhh ooooh 
CELESTE Ooohh ohhh. Til you come back to me.. 
PAUL I'm down on bended knee hee hee hee. 
They finish with a huge applause for themselves and toast with beers. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD) I think we're really good. 
CELESTE No, we ARE really good. 
Celeste punches in the numbers for the next song. It's "Islands in the Stream," made popular by Kenny Rogers and Dolly Parton. 
PAUL Aw shit! 
CELESTE Get ready. You're first. 
PAUL Baby when I met you, there was peace on earth, I set out get you with a fine tooth comb. I was soft inside. Soft inside? What the fuck? 
CELESTE Shhh come on. Focus. 
PAUL You do something to me, that I can't explain, hold me closer, and I feel no pain. Tender love is blind, it requires a dedication. 
Celeste and Paul sing in harmony. 
CELESTE PAUL Honest love, we feel, needs Honest love, we feel, needs conversation. And we ride it conversation. And we ride it it together, uh huh... it together, uh huh... 
Celeste slowly drops her mike. Paul is still singing. 
CELESTE (quietly) I can't. 
PAUL What? Come on, we're so good together. Islands in the stream, that is what we are. Get in there!! This is my favorite part! 
CELESTE No. I can't. 
PAUL I know I'm pitchy but I'm finding it. Sail away with me... 
CELESTE No. This. Us. I'm sorry. 
Paul slowly drops his mike. 
PAUL What do you mean? 
CELESTE I just...can't. 
PAUL Are you serious? Oh no. Why? 
He sits down on the couch. The music is still playing in the background. 
CELESTE I think I need to be alone? I'm not ready. I'm having fun and I feel like I'm beginning to like you and I just don't think I'm ready for that. 
PAUL What? Really? 
Celeste doesn't say anything. 
PAUL (CONT'D) (CONTD) Wow, you're breaking my heart. 
CELESTE I'm so sorry. You are so...great. But I'm getting divorced. 
PAUL Celeste, I know. 
CELESTE I think I need to go through this alone. 
PAUL Yeah. Yeah, okay. I respect that. Live by will, not by force.

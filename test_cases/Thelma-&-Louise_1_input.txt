LOUISE (V.O.) Oklahoma, Thelma.  We're crossing into New Mexico. 
THELMA (V.O.) I always wanted to see New Mexico. 
EXT.  THELMA'S POV - OUT PASSENGER WINDOW - PITCH BLACK 
EXT.  BACK ROAD - NIGHT 
The car goes streaking by. 
INT.  THELMA'S HOUSE - NIGHT (MUSCO LIGHT) 
All's quiet.  The large screen TV is ON and the room is filled with dense smoke.  Hal, Max, sit at a table going over paperwork.  Other plainclothes and surveillance guys play cards.  Darryl sits crumpled in his recliner staring blankly at the TV. 
INT.  JIMMY'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Jimmy sits on his couch with his guitar while two plainclothes cops sit reading the paper, doing the crossword puzzle. 
INT.  CAR - NIGHT 
Over music from tape: 
Thelma is sipping on a little Wild Turkey. 
THELMA Now what? 
LOUISE Now what what? 
THELMA Whaddo we do? 
LOUISE Oh, I don't know, Thelma.  I guess maybe we could turn ourselves in and spend our lives trading cigarettes for mascara so we can look nice when our families come to visit us on Saturdays.  Maybe we could have children with the prison guards. 
THELMA I'm not suggestin' that!  I'm not goin' back.  No matter what happens. So don't worry about me. 
Louise speeds up. 
Thelma hands Louise a little bottle of Wild Turkey and she drinks it down.  Thelma has one too. 
THELMA Can I ask you kind of a weird question? 
LOUISE Yeah. 
THELMA Of all the things in the world that scare you, what's the worst thing that scares you the most? 
LOUISE You mean now or before? 
THELMA Before. 
LOUISE I guess I always thought the worst thing that could happen would be to end up old and alone in some crummy apartment with one of those little dogs. 
THELMA What little dogs? 
LOUISE You know those little dogs you see people with? 
THELMA Like a Chihuahua? 
LOUISE Those, too, but you know those little hairy ones?  Those flat-faced little fuckers with those ugly goddamned teeth? 
THELMA Oh yeah.  You mean Peek-a-poos. 
LOUISE Yeah.  Those.  That always put the fear of God in me.  What about you? 
THELMA Well, to be honest, the idea of getting old with Darryl was kinda startin' to get to me. 
LOUISE I can see that. 
THELMA I mean, look how different he looks just since high school.  It's bad enough I have to get old, but doin' it with Darryl around is only gonna make it worse. (quieter) I mean, I don't think he's gonna be very nice about it. 
LOUISE Well, now, maybe you won't have to. 
THELMA Always lookin' on the bright side, aren't ya? 
EXT.  MOONLIT DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT (MUSCO LIGHT) 
They are driving through Monument Valley.  The T-Bird speeds through the beautifully moonlit desert.  It is almost like daylight. 
MONTAGE of silhouettes of cacti, huge rock formations, desert beauty SHOTS, etc. 
INT.  CAR - POV THROUGH WINDSHIELD - NIGHT 
The sky is bright and expansive and the road goes on forever. 
THELMA This is so beautiful. 
LOUISE Gosh.  It sure is. 
THELMA I always wanted to travel.  I just never got the opportunity. 
LOUISE Well, you got it now.

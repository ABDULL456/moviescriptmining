{"test1_input": "EXISTENZ \nWritten by \nDavid Cronenberg \nFourth Draft October 1, 1996 \nINT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT \nThe man facing us is bearded, sweating, intense,'joyous. Jacket and tie, jeans, fortyish. His name is Wittold Levi. eXistenZ. Levi turns to a chalkboard on a tripod and writes the word. \nLEVI Written like this. One word. Small e. Capital X, capital Z. He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience. \nLEVI eXistenZ. It's new, it's from Antenna Research, and it's here, right now. We now see Levi's audience, about seventy-five people, some standing, some sitting on plastic folding chairs. They are of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and applaud enthusiastically. We are in the central playing area of a small, deconsecrated country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low, carpeted plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski boots. \nLEVI My name is Wittold Levi, my friends call me Witt - and I'm the project manager for eXistenZ. I recognize some familiar faces - that's all right, that's all right. We won't throw you out. We encourage consumer loyalty, and we want you to help us with our product testing. We're a team, Antenna and you. A delighted stir from the crowd. \nLEVI Those of you who have come to our invited seminars before will know that I normally lead the group through our new games, but \n(MORE) \nLEVI (CONT'D) tonight, it won't be me. No, for the test launch of eXistenZ by Antenna, we have brought you a seminar leader who is rather special. An unbelieving, excited stir. Could it really be? \nLEVI Yes, it is. The world's greatest game designer is here, in person, to lead you, the first test enclave, through her newest creation, eXistenZ by Antenna... The small crowd is now tremendously excited, wide-eyed, murmuring, one or two have actually gotten on their knees. \nLEVI I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess herself - Allegra Geller! Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into it until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to now has hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an electronic wand of some sort. His name-tag identifies him as Ted Pikul (rhymes with \"Michael\", not with \"pickle\"), and we will see more of him later. As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the crowd, her fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part like water as she passes amongst them, clutching her own personal game-pod case with both hands. She mounts the dais like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog. Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is bright, acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she speaks, she is deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic. \nGELLER The world of games is in a kind of a trance. People are programmed to accept so little, but the possibilities are so great. \n(PAUSE) You probably thought that tonight, we were going to test a new game that I designed. Excited murmurings from the crowd. \nGELLER But there is no new game to test, at least, not in the usual sense. Confused, slightly disappointed mutterings. \nGELLER No, no, it's going to be much better than you expected, because eXistenZ is not just a game. It's an entirely new game system. Antenna Research and I developed it together - the eXistenZ System by Antenna - and it involves a whole lot of new toys, which you are going to be the first to try out. The crowd's spirit rises again. Levi steps forward, smiling, playing off the renewed energy. \nLEVI MetaFlesh. Levi turns to the chalkboard and writes the word. \nLEVI Written like this. One word. Capital M, capital F. MetaFlesh is what our new toys are made of - the MetaFlesh Game-Pod, only from Antenna Research. It connects with any industry standard bioport, which I know you all have or you wouldn't be here... (chuckles from the crowd) .using, however, a very non- standard connecting device which we call... Levi turns again to the chalkboard. \nLEVI .we call an UmbyCord. Spelled like this. Levi writes the word out and then turns back to his by-now- salivating audience. \nLEVI I guess you can tell I started off as a schoolteacher. \n4 (APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES) But I never had anything quite so fun or so revolutionary to teach as what Allegra and I are going to teach you all tonight. With a theatrical flourish, Levi whirls around to face his two assistants, who have finished laying out their devices on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention at either end of it. \nLEVI Are the MetaFlesh Game-Pods by Antenna Research ready? \nASSISTANTS \n(TOGETHER) Yes, Mr; Levi. \n", "test1_true": "FEMALE ASSISTANT Twenty-one, Mr. Levi. Levi's face clouds slightly. The audience does not hear the following exchange. \nLEVI \n(SOTTO VOCE) Twenty-one? I thought we had an even two dozen. \nMALE ASSISTANT The first three we opened were... unhealthy. \nLEVI Really? Any chance that some of the others...? \nFEMALE ASSISTANT We think we're clean. \nLEVI \nJ \n(RESTRAINED FURY) God-damn better be. Levi turns back to his audience, radiant once more. \nLEVI We have twenty-one prototype MetaFlesh Game-Pods, and that means that for our first wave test enclave we need twenty-one volunteers who will port in these slave units with the Game-Pod Goddess herself... Levi doesn't need to finish his pitch. Every hand is waving in the air, and every pair of lips is saying, \"Me, me, oh God, please, let it be me!\" Geller can only stand by modestly and beam at the intensity of the small crowd's enthusiasm. \nINT. COUNTRY CHURCH. MINUTES LATER - NIGHT \nA SHORT MONTAGE as the twenty-one volunteers mount the dais and are fitted with their game gear: The assistants undo the heavy-duty snap locks and split open the ski-boot-like plastic modules on the back table. Inside, resting in a lining of dense foam, are what look almost like living kidneys: the MetaFlesh Game-Pods. Coiled in each boot toe is the Y-shaped, multi-player UmbyCord that comes with each pod, a split twelve-foot connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord, twisted, translucent, blue and red veiny vessels running just below the surface. The volunteers watch in hushed reverence, as though about to receive communion. The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases. The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the back of the game-pods. The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, which are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal jacks positioned just above the belt line. Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quivering, rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous system, on his lap. \nThe last chair is taken by Allegra Geller, who is fussed i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master game- pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to the players on either side of her. We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard, Pikul, standing with arms folded near the church's side door, watching the proceedings with fascination. A loud knocking at the door forces Pikul to turn away from the action on the dais. He walks over to the door and opens it. A hyper, exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church. Pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his way. \nPIKUL Hold it. Not so fast. In response, the fan thrusts a card at him. Pikul takes the card, a complex invitation card which includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats his name, Joel Dichter. Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul into the depths of the church, nervously adjusting the vinyl case slung over his shoulder. \nDICHTER Oh, god. I hope I'm not too late. Did I miss the port-in? \nPIKUL It's just the first wave. You can be part of the second wave. (rereads the invitation) OK, Joel Dichter. Put your arms up. I have to scan you. Metal and heavy synthetics can't come in. \nDICHTER \n(INCREDULOUS) A weapons check? \nPIKUL More for recording devices. Lotta money invested in these games. Industrial espionage happens. What's in this case? \nDICHTER I brought my game-pod. It's got original Marway tissue architecture. It's kind of obsolete but I was hoping,... \n(MORE) \nDICHTER (CONT'D) even though I couldn't afford the Antenna Fifteen upgrade, I figured out a method of virtual porting that I thought might... Pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case, then opens the zipper and feels around. In the case is a more solid, rubbery version of the new MetaFlesh pods. \nPIKUL You won't need it tonight. Everything's provided for. Dichter suddenly spots Geller on the dais. He almost faints. \nDICHTER Migod! Is that who I think it is? \n.PIKUL (with paternal pride) Yeah, that's her. She's something, isn't she? \n", "test1_id": 2115, "test2_input": "DICHTER But why would a star like her come to a product seminar in a little one-horse town like this? \nPIKUL This is where the real people live, Joel. Her real fans, like you. \nDICHTER Yeah, well, you said it. Just like me. Dichter has scanned OK. Pikul waves him into the church to join the spectators who will form the second wave and re- locks the door. On the dais, in the center of the circle of linked game players, Levi nods at Geller. \nLEVI Everything's in order. Are you ready, Allegra? \nT \nGELLER \n(PUMPED) Sure. This is my favourite part. \nThere is giddy laughter in the room. Geller looks at every player-in the circle as Levi steps down off the platform and retires to the far edge of the small, watching throng. \nGELLER I'm ready to download eXistenZ by Antenna Research into you all now. I'm warning you, it's going to be a wild ride, but don't panic no matter what happens. I'll see you all back here in no time at all. Now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous, uncertain, but it's too late. Geller depresses a nipple-like protuberance on the game-pod on her lap, and all the players close their eyes and go rigid, like members of a seance who have suddenly been contacted by the spirit world. The pods in their laps begin a rhythmic, peristaltic rippling. At the edge of the crowd, Pikul sidles up to Levi. \nPIKUL \n(TO LEVI) She seems to be very shy. It never occurred to me that a big star would be shy. \nLEVI She spends most of her time alone in a room designing her games. I think she'd like it best if she never had to show them to anybody. \nPIKUL Really? She doesn't enjoy all the adulation? \nLEVI She hates having to port in with her fans. It's too intimate. \nPIKUL Then why does she do it? \nLEVI \n(LAUGHS) We make her do it. \nI D \nPIKUL By \"we\" you mean, the game company, Antenna Research? \nA \nLEVI ' That's what I mean. \nPIKUL Why? \nI \nLEVI \n(SUDDENLY SUSPICIOUS) Are you with us or did an independent security company send you? \nPIKUL Me? Oh, I'm with your own management training program. (shows him a card) I want to end up in marketing and public relations. (holds up security wand) The only thing I know about security is how to switch this thing on. \n", "test2_true": "(SATISFIED) Well, for example, we've spent a fortune developing eXistenZ, but we all know it's a risky project. She might have to make changes. It's the only way we can convince her that there might be a problem. \nPIKUL \n(PUZZLED) A problem with her new game? \nLEVI eXistenZ is a lot more than a game. \nPIKUL Yeah, right, it's a game system. I heard that. \nLEVI And we're worried that it's too intellectual, too complex, too weird, too artsy. That argument ; never bothers her until she faces her fans. She hates to be rejected in the flesh, so we make her come out sometimes to take the heat. \nPIKUL \n(ADMIRINGLY) 4 I've heard that she's very sensitive. A strange, choral humming begins to fill the church. Pikul and Levi turn their attention to the dais, where the fans rock and sway with the pulsing of the pods in their laps. \nPIKUL What are they doing? \nLEVI \n(LAUGHS) It's the new Antenna Research theme song. We thought this would be a good way to launch it. Everybody who plays eXistenZ is going to be very familiar with that tune. Haltingly, but gamely, Pikul tries to hum along. \nPIKUL Catchy. Levi helps him out, and soon the whole room is humming along happily, warmed by the Antenna Research corporate theme song. The whole room, that is, except for Joel Dichter, who, at the edge of the dais, is more concerned with fumbling around in the vinyl pod-case hanging from his shoulder. In the case, we watch as Dichter tears open his obsolete game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon, a pistol made of bone and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a small mammal - whose snout is the barrel, whose rigid hind leg is the trigger. Dichter takes his weapon out of its case, shakes off a few gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh, and steps up onto the dais. Pikul is the first to notice this. He glances at Levi, who's still blissed out and humming, then launches himself awkwardly through the crowd. Now in the middle of the circle, Dichter makes his way towards the blissfully unsuspecting Geller, raising his weapon as he goes. \nDICHTER Death to eXistenZ! Death to Antenna Research! Death to the demoness Allegra Geller! \nP \nPIKUL \n(TO DICHTER) No! Don't do it! Dichter turns to see Pikul stumbling through the small crowd, scrambling onto the dais. Distracted, Dichter hurriedly raises his weapon again and fires it at Geller. The first shot hits her in the shoulder and spins her off her chair, which collapses over her and takes the second bullet on its seat rim. The circle of players on the dais moans as one, swoons and jostles: they are all feeling the neural surge of Geller's traumatized nervous system. Peeking out from under her folding chair, Geller's eyes are wide with fear and confusion. She clutches her shoulder without being aware of it. Blood seeps in between her fingers Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform to get at Dichter, who fires wildly, hitting two of the players nearest Geller. The circle of players immediately goes spastic, screaming and twitching and dropping to the ground and writhing. Many of them are clutching their shoulders in the same spot as Geller, sympathy pain transmitting through their UmbyCords. Pikul manages to tackle Dichter, then starts whacking at him with the security wand. Dichter twists around and raises his weapon at Pikul, who immediately backs off in terror. But before Dichter can pull the trigger, the two assistants produce small, normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty their clips into the prostrate Dichter. Dichter manages to squeeze off one last shot at the approaching Jevi, hitting him squarely in the chest. Levi goes down and is lost amongst the jostling feet. The watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the players unplug from the game-pods which are obviously causing them distress. Three of the players attack the dying Dichter, dragging their game-pods after them, kicking at whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of bodies. in the turmoil, Pikul is knocked to the ground. Amid the stamping, sliding feet, he finds himself lying across the stricken-Levi. Levi clutches Pikul desperately. \nLEVI Get her out of here! Save her! There might be more of them! Go on! \nPIKUL Me? Me take her? \nLEVI (urgent, pleading) We have enemies in our own house. Trust no one. Trust no one... The wide-eyed Pikul scrambles to his feet and promptly trips over the all-but-dead Dichter. He falls painfully to his knees, struggles up again, and finds the bizarre bone gun in his hand. Pikul stares at it, fascinated, horrified. He turns back to Levi, but Levi's eyes are rolling back as he loses consciousness. The two assistants are making their way towards them through the shoving, shuffling throng, guns cocked, faces set hard. Panicked, Pikul jams the bone gun into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform, wildly looking around for Geller. She and her chair have slipped off the dais in a heap only a few feet away, and she is in several kinds of agony. Pikul unports her, which immediately brings her some relief and a lot of clarity. Pikul wards off a couple of fans with one arm, screams at them. \nPIKUL \n(SCREAMS) She's coming with me! I'm responsible for her! She's supposed to come with me! To his surprise, Geller laughs a dazed, hearty laugh. \nGELLER \n(LAUGHS) Am I? With you? \nPIKUL (quietly, firmly) Yeah, you're coming with me. Pikul pulls her to her feet, but she immediately dives back to the floor to find her game-pod and UmbyCord. \nGELLER (suddenly near hysteria) I can't lose this! I can't lose this! She finds the game-pod still under the folding chair, a bit flattened on one side but in one piece. She grabs the game- pod and its UmbyCord and stuffs them into her MetaFlesh pod case which has been knocked to the edge of the dais. As she clutches it to her, Pikul takes her hand and hauls her through the crowd, which is now spilling off the overcrowded dais and clutching at Geller fitfully, like Velcro. They head for the door, fighting everybody off as though they might be lethal. As they leave through the side door, Pikul sees five or six fans, shrieking like monkeys, still stomping and kicking the body of Dichter viciously, hysterically, while Levi's two assistants carry him to the safety of the church's apse. \n", "test2_id": 2116, "test3_input": "EXT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT \nPikul and Geller spew out of the doorway and find themselves standing alone in the weedy parking lot of the church. The church itself stands isolated on a country road just outside a town which is not much more than two gas stations and a crossroad. Pikul and Geller look around wildly. The vehicles in the parking lot are country, pickup trucks, rusted vans, 4x4s. Across the road, aloof, maybe too high-class for the parking lot, sits a Land Rover Defender 110, the one with the roof cage and the seven seats and the winch hanging off the front. Geller gestures towards the Defender. \nGELLER Let's take my limo. \nPIKUL \n(WILD) No, no! \nGELLER Why no? \nPIKUL I don't trust the driver! \nGELLER You drive, idiot! \nThey cross the road and jump in the Defender. Frances, the driver, sixtyish, a retired lady farmer who moonlights, is apprehensive. \nFRANCES What's the commotion, Miss Geller? Say, are you all right? What's goin' on in there? \nGELLER We need this vehicle, and we need it without you. But with the keys. \nFRANCES I can't do that. I can't abandon my vehicle. Geller pulls the weird gun out of an astonished Pikul's pocket. She points it at Frances. \nGELLER Get out, Frances. You can say you were hijacked. \nFRANCES \n(CHUCKLES) It'll take more than a dead squirrel to get me out of this seat. Geller fires two shots. One rips a hole in Frances's headrest. \nFRANCES (getting out of her seat) You have to push the shift lever down to get it into reverse. \nGELLER Thanks, Frances. They drive off down the country road, leaving Frances in the dust. \nINT. DEFENDER LIMO - NIGHT \nPikul drives. He can see why the limo is an off-road vehicle: the road is terrible, dirt and gravel, stutter potholes and sharp ridges, the occasional fallen tree. \nPIKUL (manic, scared) I normally like the countryside, don't you? Normally, the country is relaxing and calm. \nGELLER Only if you don't really know what's going on. \nPIKUL What do you mean? \nGELLER There is great stress and anger and violence in the countryside. Thousands of life forms all screaming ME ME ME and trying to kill and dominate and devour the other life forms. It's terrifying and exhausting. \nPIKUL \n(LAMELY) Well, I like the countryside. \nGELLER That's good, `cause you might end up spending a lot of time here. \n", "test3_true": "GELLER Sure. If you go back home to the city, they'll probably be waiting for you. \nPIKUL They? \nGELLER Yeah. My assassins. They'd want to have a little talk with you about where I am. \nPIKUL I was hoping that was just one crazy guy. \nGELLER Did you hear the way he screamed at me? He wasn't alone. \nPIKUL Everybody likes a conspiracy. It's more satisfying than just one crazy guy doing one crazy thing. Geller goes silent. \nPIKUL Well, what are we going to do out here? Do you know your way around? You know any country people? \nGELLER Not country people. Games people. The countryside's full of games development people, project co- ordinators, little factories - you name it. \nPIKUL That's weird. I never knew that. \nGELLER The city's full of bad microwaves, bad thermals, bad electro-optics. You can't shield from it anymore. You can't get true readings. The whole industry moved out of the city years ago. \nPIKUL So you know your way around. We can hide out. \nGELLER Maybe. But it seems I have some enemies I didn't know I had. \"Death to Allegra Geller.\" How'd you like to hear somebody with a gun screaming, \"Death to Ted Pikul\"? \nPIKUL Wow. (reflective pause; then) Hey, how'd you know my name? \nGELLER (indicating his name tag) You're labelled. \nPIKUL Oh. Yeah. \n(PAUSE) How did you know how to fire that, gun? I've never seen anything like it. \nGELLER It has a trigger. I pulled it. \nPIKUL Can I see it? \nGELLER Later. I think I'm gonna use it in my next game. If there ever is a next game. Pikul glances at her. He hits a pothole and she bounces around in her seat, exposing her far shoulder to him. Her shirt is soaked with blood. \nPIKUL Migod, you're bleeding. I forgot you got hit. There is an urgent buzzing from somewhere in Pikul's breast pocket. \nGELLER What's that? \nPIKUL It's my pink-fone. I'm not sure I should answer it. \nGELLER Answer it. Pikul pulls the pink-fone - it's soft surgical plastic, palm-sized - out of his pocket. When he squeezes it open, a diffuse pink light swells up from deep inside it. \nPIKUL \n(INTO PHONE) Ted Pikul. \n", "test3_id": 2117}

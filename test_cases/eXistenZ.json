{"train": "(PAUSE) What happened? Some fan went crazy and started shooting up the place. I don't know why. He was just nuts. Allegra Geller? She's with me. We're OK. Yeah. Yeah. \n(MORE) \nPIKUL (CONT'D) \n(PAUSE) You're kidding me. You're kidding me! God. 1 can't believe it. I can't do that. No, how can I do that? Well, I'm not really sure where we are because... Geller grabs the pink-tone from him. She fumbles around with it, trying to find the power button. She accidentally summons up a read-out, which she pauses to look at. What she sees makes her glance up at Pikul. \nPIKUL What? Can I have my pink-tone back? Geller finds the power button and pushes it. The pink inner light flutters out. She unceremoniously throws the pink-tone out the window. It lands in a rain ditch full of frogs. \nPIKUL \n(IN SHOCK) What did you do that for? That was our lifeline to civilization. \nGELLER That was a rangefinder. As long as you have that, they know where you are. \nPIKUL They? You mean head office? \nGELLER I mean anybody. \n(PAUSE) I heard what Levi said to you. He said, \"We have enemies in our own house.\" He said it as he was dying. \nPIKUL \n(FLUSTERED) I don't think he died. I mean, do you? I think he maybe fainted... Maybe he went unconscious... \nPIKUL That was Alex Kindred, head of publicity and marketing, at Antenna HQ... \n(WISTFUL) .on that very expensive pink- fone you threw away. \n(DEEP SIGH) He said that some bizarre fanatical group called the Anti- eXistenZialists has put a price of 5 million dollars on your head, payable to anybody who kills you. It's been released to all the media now. Everybody knows about it. \nGELLER \n(IN DISBELIEF) Anti-existentialists? \nPIKUL No. Anti-eXistenZialists. Capital X, capital Z. They somehow found out about eXistenZ and they want to kill you for creating it. They say that the eXistenZ game system will \"finally destroy reality\", or something totally nuts like that. \nGELLER \n(STRANGELY SATISFIED) Yeah. \nPIKUL It makes sense to you? You're not suprised? \nGELLER I hear things. It's hard to surprise me. \n(PAUSE) And what else? \nPIKUL Kindred said that I'm your bodyguard and the company is holding me totally responsible for your safety. \nGELLER \n(WITH IRONY) Amazing, isn't it? \nEXT. MOTEL - NIGHT \nWe follow the Defender as it parks outside the Salmon Falls Motel. Pikul jumps out carrying two paper bags of Perky Pat's takeout. He knees the truck door shut and walks over to motel door 5. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nInside the very basic motel room, Pikul sits hypnotized, reverentially watching Geller as he obsessively packs the greasy remains of their Perky Pat burgers into the smallest possible paper bundle. Geller is sitting in the middle of her twin bed, her pod before her on a hotel towel which is draped over her lap, UmbyCord jacked into her bioport, a second towel slipping off her shoulders leaving her almost naked, her shoulder wound livid in the 25-watt light of the night table lamp. Her hands twitch delicately over the surface of the pod like insect antennae, so delicately that we are not sure that she is actually touching the pod. Her eyes are half-closed, and she is obviously in some kind of trance-like, ecstatic state. Finally, she comes out of it and unplugs her UmbyCord, discretely rearranging her towels in the process. She sighs and speaks, not exactly to Pikul. \nGELLER The whole gamesworld is in a kind of trance. \nPIKUL Yes. I remember you said that at the church. \nJ \nGELLER People are prepared to accept so little. They're in a'cage formed out of their own limited \n(MORE) \nGELLER (CONT'D) expectations. They have no idea what amazing things could be theirs. \nPIKUL Where were you just now? What were you doing? \nGELLER (a worried frown) I was wandering through eXistenZ - the new system, I mean. (a shy, sexy smile) I like it in there. Of course, without another player you're only a tourist. It's frustrating. \nPIKUL Why won't you let me contact Antenna? They've got to be going crazy, wondering what's happened to you. I mean, it's not like we've done something wrong. We just ran because we didn't know how many of them there were, right? I think we owe it to Antenna to let them know you're all right, to get them to send somebody to help you who knows what he's doing... And besides, I can't... I can't just keep doing this, whatever it is, you know, forever, not having any idea when it's going to be... Geller gets up and goes over to Pikul. She pulls up his shirt. \nPIKUL Hey, what are you doing? \nGELLER Where's your bioport? Don't tell me you were never fitted. I can't believe it. Pikul shrugs his shirt back down, starts tucking it in. \nPIKUL No, I was never fitted with a bioport. What do you care? \nGELLER You're hoping to get into the biz and you've never played one of my games. You've never played any game. That means you have no idea \nwhat a genius I am. \nPIKUL \n(LAMELY) My clinic master told me I don't need to play a game to know how to sell it. \nGELLER Bullshit. Posturing. You don't play my games, you don't work for Antenna Research, I'll make sure of that. \nPIKUL Look, I've been dying to play your games. But I have this - phobia about having my body penetrated - surgically. You know what I mean. \nGELLER I'm not so sure I do. \nPIKUL Getting a bioport fitted... I dunno. I can't do it. It's too freaky. Makes my skin crawl. \nGELLER God, c'mon. They just pop your spine with a little hydro-gun. Shoot the port-plug into it. They do it at malls, like getting your ears pierced. \nGAS \n(COOL) A bioport, now, that's a sort of a hole in your spine, isn't it? Lotta assholes `round here, but that's generally it. I don't know why you'd be talking to me about that, lady. Geller smiles a knowing smile. \nGELLER Sure you do. Gas looks at her closely for the first time. His eyes widen in disbelief. He pulls a greasy wallet out of his overalls and flips out the card holders. Amongst various family photos, hot rod photos, fishing photos, is a photo of Allegra Geller clipped from a glossy magazine. Under the photo is the legend \"Genius In A Game-Pod\". Gas takes her hand in his and kisses it. \nGAS Allegra Geller. You changed my life. \nINT. GAS-STATION GARAGE - NIGHT \nPikul sits on a mouldy, greasy, plump, wingback chair in the corner of the gas-station garage, watching Gas balance shakily on one leg as he puts on a fresh set of overalls. \nPIKUL What was your life like before? \nGAS Before? \nPIKUL Before it was changed by Allegra Geller. \nGAS I operated a gas station. \nPIKUL But you still operate a gas station, don't you? \nGAS Only on the most pathetic level of reality. Geller's work liberated me. \nPIKUL Liberated? \nGAS Did you ever play her game ArtGod? One word, capital A, capital G? \nPIKUL I don't have a bioport, remember? \nGAS \"Thou, the player of the game, art God.\" Very spiritual. Funny, too. God, the artist. The mechanic. (chuckles to himself) Funny. Gas zips up his fresh overalls. \nPIKUL \n(UNEASY) Those are sterile, are they? \nGAS Not to worry. They way they set things up, you could fire in a bioport in a slaughterhouse and not generate an infection. \nPIKUL Then why the clean overalls? \nGAS It's a mental thing. Helps me focus. The one thing you don't want to do is miss with the stud- finder. \nPIKUL Oh, God. \nGAS \n(BIG SMILE) God, the mechanic. \nZ'R Gas slides open a drawer of his red metal mechanic's rolling toolbox and pulls out a greasy device that looks like a carbon-fibre voltage meter. \nGAS We call this thing a stud-finder.' It locates the spot on your spine where the x intersects with the y. We don't want to be even a micron out of whack. That's when you get troubles. It's a little radar/sonar/laser thingee. Marks you with a special range-finding dye. \n(PANIC-STRICKEN) What's going on? I can't walk! \nGAS The procedure comes with its own epidural, just like when you have a baby. Kinda like instant paralysis from the waist down? That's why it didn't hurt you. It'll wear off in about twenty minutes. As they ease Pikul into a sitting position in the chair, Gas almost drops the insertion gun which he has been holding in one hand. He leans it against the wingback chair, and Pikul notices blood and flecks of skin on Gas's work gloves. \nPIKUL You're looking more like a butcher than a mechanic. \nGAS Things do get kinda confused these days, don't they? I'm gonna go wash up. You two make yourselves at home. Gas strides off towards the washroom with an air of great satisfaction. Geller eases her game-pod out of its case and starts to attach its two-player, Y-shaped UmbyCord to it. \nPIKUL What are you doing? \nGELLER We don't have to wait for the swelling to go down. \nPIKUL You're going to port into me? While I'm paralysed? \nGELLER You wanted to play my game, didn't you? \nPIKUL Yeah, I did, and I do, but... Here? Now? \nGELLER It's an instant-on world, isn't it? She lifts up his shirt to reveal the new bioport. It already looks a bit less angry than it did before. Geller caresses it, prods it, plays with it. Then she takes out a little bottle of WD-40 and sprays it around and into the port. \nPIKUL What's that for? It feels cold. \nGELLER New ports are sometimes a bit tight. Wouldn't want to hurt you. \nPIKUL How come bioports don't get infected? I mean, they open right into your body... \nGELLER Listen to what you're saying, Pikul. Don't be ludicrous. \nPIKUL \n(VERY NERVOUS) Don't you think you could call me Ted? \nGELLER Maybe afterwards. Geller gently works her UmbyJack into Pikul's bioport. She locks her eyes onto his, then squeezes her game-pod's ON teat. Instantly, her pod convulses and begins to flash and spark and crackle. White electronic smoke seeps from its crevices and a kind of bioelectronic fat sputters from its pores. Geller leaps up from the arm of the chair and rips her UmbyJack out of Pikul's spine. He can't feel it, but the furious force of her move twists him in his chair. \nGELLER \n(FURIOUS) Shit, Pikul! I can't believe this! I trusted you and you blew my pod! You must have neural- surged! \nPIKUL What do you mean? \nGELLER \n(IN DESPAIR) I jacked you into my pod and you obviously panicked. Now it's totally fucked! This is a disaster! \nPIKUL I.. I was nervous, but I didn't panic. \nGELLER \n(FIGHTING HYSTERIA) I was forced to trust you and you panicked and you neural-surged, and you blew my pod. \nPIKUL You can get a new pod... \nPIKUL That's two people in one day who wanted to actually kill you. \nGELLER I've never been more popular. \nPIKUL Allegra, we need help. \nGELLER You're right. I've got to get this pod fixed. \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD - DAY \nThe Defender winds its way up a heavily wooded mountain road. \nEXT. CALEDON SKI CLUB - DAY \nThe Defender turns off a dirt road and rumbles through an open gate. The stone gateposts bear a coy rustic sign which reads, CALEDON SKI CLUB - PRIVATE ROAD. \nINT. DEFENDER - DAY \nPIKUL We're going skiing? \nGELLER Nothing in the countryside is what it seems. It's all appearance versus reality, and the reality here is something unique. \nEXT. CALEDON SKI CLUBHOUSE - DAY \nThe Defender pulls up beside the chalet-style ski clubhouse. As they get out of the truck, the same bizarre insect that Geller was playing with the night before lands on the truck's side mirror, narrowly missing Pikul as it flops around in the air. \nPIKUL Look at that huge bug. It's got two heads. \nGELLER ' They breed them here. They're not supposed to get away. They get out and walk towards the clubhouse. \nPIKUL What if somebody comes up here and really wants to ski? \nGELLER Nobody actually physically skis any more, Pikul. You know that. \nPIKUL I've watched some ski shows. Downhill racing, Austrian Alps. \nGELLER \n(CONTEMPTUOUSLY) Yeah, right. \nINT. CALEDON SKI CLUBHOUSE - DAY \nPikul and Geller enter the clubhouse. There is nobody around. It looks like a real ski clubhouse, complete with racks of ski pants and ski boots. But when Pikul examines the goods, he can see that they're old and cracked and falling apart. They've been there for years. ` A man comes out of a back room, early sixties, authoritarian air, eastern-European. He is Kiri Vinokur, and he lights up when he sees Geller. \nVINOKUR My darling Allegra. I am so pleased to see you here. They embrace. \nGELLER Kiri Vinokur, this is my bodyguard, Ted Pikul. \nVINOKUR Hello, yes, I heard the ridiculous story about this fatwa against you. The company is desperately trying to find you. Is it really serious? Are you in danger? \nPIKUL If I'm her bodyguard, then she's in grave danger. \nINT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT \nIn their chalet, a cozy and inn-like'space, Pikul and Geller examine his new bioport while sitting on one of the chalet's twin beds. The region around the port looks swollen, bruised and tender. \nPIKUL It hurts. I think it's infected. \nGELLER It's not infected. It's just excited. It wants action. She attempts to jack her pod into his port using the Y- shaped UmbyCord, but he twists away from her. \nPIKUL But I really don't think that I want action. Me, I mean. The bearer of the excited bioport. What I want is... not now. Not here. I feel too... too exposed. Geller sighs, then switches into her explaining-the-facts- of-life-to-a-child mode. They are both aware that they are replaying an earlier moment. \nGELLER (cradling her pod) My baby here has now taken three major hits, one in the church, one in the gas station, and one on the operating table. The only way I can tell if everything's OK - the game's not been contaminated, the pod's not fucked - is to play eXistenZ with somebody friendly. Are you friendly, or are you not? Pikul swallows nervously, then turns his back to Geller so that she can port in. \nPIKUL You're telling me this thing will run off my body's energy? \nGELLER \n(PORTING IN) That's how they work. See? You're hummin' along already. Sure enough, he is. Geller deftly twists the second jack into her own bioport and takes a deep breath. \nGELLER All right. eXistenZ. Only from Antenna. Here we go. \nPIKUL \n(APPREHENSIVE) You've got a bit of an unfair advantage, don't you? How can I possibly compete with the designer of the system? \nGELLER You could beat the guy who invented poker, couldn't you? Geller flicks the game-pod nipple, and the chalet begins to melt away around them. \nINT. GAME STORE - NIGHT \nThe chalet melts away and is replaced by a scruffy game store. A lot of kids and strange adults mill around amongst the dusty racks and pinball machines, examining packages of weird games and game devices, muttering secretively to each other, and it is amongst these dull rows of shelves that Pikul and Geller find themselves standing. A cashier works away behind an old-fashioned cash register that sits on a tall counter. The cashier, a gangly, sallow young man, glances at Pikul and Geller suspiciously from time to time. Pikul feels himself', his clothes, moves his arms, his tongue. He feels around behind him but there is no game-pod or UmbyCord in sight. \nPIKUL That was beautiful. I feel... just like me. Is that kind of transition normal, a kind of smooth dissolve from place to place? \nGELLER Depends on the style of the game. You can get jagged, brutal cuts, slow fades, shimmering little morphs... \nPIKUL This is amazing. I had no idea. We... we're still ourselves, but we're in the game. Where are we? \nGELLER It's basically a game store I used to hang out in as a kid. \nPIKUL \n(ENCHANTED) Are you serious? \nGELLER We're ported into a game-pod together, remember? eXistenZ has complete access to both our central nervous systems. Its game architecture will be based on our memories, our anxieties, our preoccupations... \nPIKUL \n(DISENCHANTED) Are you serious? \nGELLER You keep saying that. (examines a game-pak) Look at this. Games I've never heard of. Biological Father. Hit By A Car. Viral Ecstasy. Chinese Restaurant. (reads pak back) In Viral Ecstasy, you are a virus invading a specific human body. You create ingenious viral strategies to cope with the efforts of the body's immune system to destroy you...\" \nPIKUL Wait a minute. That reminds me. What precisely is the goal of the game we're playing now? I mean, the rules, the objective... Nobody's ever really said anything about what you have to do in eXistenZ. \nGELLER \n(GIGGLING) It's your character who said it. It's a kind of schizophrenic feeling, isn't it? But you'll get used to it. There are things that have to be said to advance the plot and establish the characters, and those things get said whether you want to say them or not. Don't fight it. Just go with it. \nPIKUL But should you be saying that in front of him? Nader? \nGELLER Look at him. Pikul does. Nader doesn't seem to have heard him. In fact, he doesn't respond at all other than to hum the Antenna Research corporate-song and tap his fingers repetitively, caught in a small behavioural loop. Geller chuckles at Pikul's confusion. \nPIKUL \n(RE NADER) What's he doing? \nGELLER He's gone into a game loop, he's locked up, and he won't come out of it until you give him a proper game line of dialogue. \nPIKUL This is tricky. \nGELLER Start by repeating your last line. Include his name so he knows you're talking.to him. \nPIKUL We're here, Dorsey Nader, and that's all that matters. Nader immediately comes out of his loop. He chuckles. \nNADER You're right. That is all tha matters. Pikul smiles, delighted. Now he takes a deep breath, closes his eyes, relaxes. The line comes. \nPIKUL Well, Nader, you said you had what we want. We're waiting. \nNADER You're going to need these micro- pods to download your new identities. I assume that you both have had those industry standard bioports you mentioned installed. \nGELLER Yes, of course, that's right. We both have bioports. Here she pauses, looks at Pikul. \nGELLER We do, don't we? \nPIKUL I assumed we did. I mean, here. In the game. Of course, we might not. \nGELLER We'd better check. While Nader goes into game lock-up, Geller lifts up her shirt. Pikul takes a look. Her bioport is there, although slightly rougher, puckered, more organic than in non-game life. \nPIKUL Yeah, it's there. Looks a little different, but it's there. Geller grabs Pikul's shirt and lifts it. His is there too. \nGELLER I see what you mean. \n(TO NADER) Yes, we both have bioports. \nNADER \n(UNLOCKING) Good. Port in and this'll tell you all you need to know for now. Pikul and Geller examine the pak, which bears the Cortical Systematics name and logo. It seems to be a miniature version of their real-life game-pod. \nNADER I'm going to leave while you finish up here. It wouldn't be good for us all to be seen together. Nader gets up to leave, pauses at the door. \nNADER Don't do anything I wouldn't do. Nader chuckles a very theatrical chuckle, then leaves. \nPIKUL I assume that Nader is our entry point into the game. \nGELLER Yeah. Kinda disappointing. \nGELLER (kissing and caressing \nAGAIN) They're just where we left them, sitting quietly, eyes closed. Just like meditating. \nPIKUL (reluctantly kissing and \nCARESSING BACK) I don't know. I feel really vulnerable. Disembodied. \nGELLER Don't sweat it. All your senses are still operating. You'll pop right out of the game if there's a problem. They begin to make seriously hot love amrngst the game paks and cartons of replacement UmbyCords. And then the game store melts away around them. \nINT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY \nPikul finds himself sitting at an immensely long bench in the process of assembling insect motherboards along with many other workers. Pikul can still feel the warmth of Geller's body, but she's nowhere to be seen. A gritty, narrow conveyor belt runs down the middle of the bench, upon which floats an endless stream of motherboard parts which the workers pick off as they need them. The belt begins and ends in the anonymous smoky innards of the building. The place, a high-ceilinged pre-fab, long and narrow with hundreds of blanked-out windows, houses a game-pod assembly line. Pikul looks down to find himself wearing a photo-ID card clipped to his shirt pocket that tells him he is somebody named LARRY ASHEN. He has to twist the card around because, of course, from his vantage point it is upside down. \nNOURISH Tryin' to remember who you are? Pikul snaps his head up to see a long-haired, morose-looking worker sitting next to him, snickering. Mocking Pikul, he twists his own card around, comically bunching up his work shirt so he can read his own name, which is YEVGENY NOURISH. \nNOURISH Hey, it works! I must be Yevgeny Nourish! Nourish leans over to squint at Pikul's name tag. \nNOURISH And you... you are new to the Trout Farm. \nPIKUL Yes. I... I'm... very new. Did you say trout farm? \nNOURISH You know - raise baby trout from eggs and then stock the rivers with them. \n(BROAD GESTURE) Entire place used to be a trout farm. Seems like most everything used to be something else, doesn't it? \nPikul looks around him. The place is humming, but Geller is still nowhere in sight. The workers are small-town locals o_\u00c2\u00b0 a wide range of ages. Pikul looks down at his own hands, which seem to,know what to do: place glue on the boards, glue them down to a resin frame using a template, insert needle-like electrodes into the bodies of certain epoxied insects. The insect boards, Pikul notes, are actually whole insects coated in epoxy and frozen together like a sick collage. At least, here in the game they are. Pikul is now automatically doing flashy moves with the odd materials in front of him with great dexterity. Nourish takes note of this. \nNOURISH I (with admiration) You might be new but you seem to know what you're doing. \nPIKUL \n(GENUINELY PERPLEXED) It surprises me more than it surprises you. Nourish moves back to the insect motherboard that he has been working on, then leans over again exactly as he did the first time. It has the effect of an instant replay, but not in slow-motion. \nNOURISH \n(WITH ADMIRATION) You might be new but you seem to know what you're doing. Pikul realizes he hasn't given the right answer. He now just lets it come without thinking. \nPIKUL I, ah... I've been trained by the very best. Nourish unlocks and looks around with a delicate furtiveness. \nNOURISH \n(FURTIVE) So have I. Where do you plan to have lunch? \nPIKUL I'm new here. I have no plans for lunch. \nNOURISH 11 I suggest the Chinese restaurant in the forest. Everybody knows where it is. Just ask. \nPIKUL Won't you be going there too? \nNOURISH I have other plans for lunch. But I do suggest that you order the special. And don't take no for an answer. \nPIKUL It's her birthday. The waiter locks up for a moment, then unfreezes. \nWAITER A birthday is a special occasion. I will therefore bring the special for everybody. The waiter walks away. The others at the table get up and move away, drift over to other tables with occasional furtive backward glances at Pikul and Geller. \nPIKUL I guess the special isn't very popular. \nGELLER I guess. \nPIKUL But you know, really, don't you? You don't have to guess. I mean, it's your game, your little universe. \nGELLER I don't know. You have to understand that, to understand what we've really created with eXistenZ. \nPIKUL You're telling me, for example, that you don't know what the special is? \nGELLER Correct. I don't. \nPIKUL Or why we ordered it. \nGELLER We ordered it because another game character told you to. That's a clue we can't ignore. But that's just basic games playing. \nPIKUL I want to put the game on pause. Geller just looks at him, puzzled. Pikul panics. \nPIKUL \n(PANICKING) The game can be paused, can't it? I mean, all games can be paused, right? \nGELLER Sure, yeah, but why? What's wrong? Aren't you dying to see what's special about the special? \nPIKUL I'm feeling a little disconnected from my real life. I'm kind of losing touch with the texture of it, you know what I mean? I mean, I actually think there's an element of psychosis involved here. I mean, I don't know where my body really is, or where reality is, what I've actually done, or not done. \nGELLER That's a great sign. It means your nervous system is fully engaging with the game architecture. The game is a lot more fun when it starts to feel realer than real. \nPIKUL \n(PAUSE) Yeah. Pikul stands up and screams at the top of his lungs. \nPIKUL \n(SCREAMS) eXistenZ is paused! The Chinese restaurant melts away. \nINT. GUEST CHALET - DAY \nThe guest chalet melts back up around them. Pikul looks around. They are still sitting on the bed, ported into Geller's pod together. \nPIKUL Did I do that? I guess I did. \nGELLER So how does it feel? \nPIKUL What? \nGELLER Your real life. The one you came back for. \nGELLER Oh, good! Pikul looks up from his big bowl, which is rapidly filling with creature parts. His fingers are'slimy and sticky, but he doesn't stop, his fingers working expertly on their own. \nPIKUL Good? You think this is good? \n( AM- \nO: \nGELLER Yeah. It's a genuine game urge. It's something that your game character was born to do. Don't fight it. \nPIKUL I am fighting it, but it isn't doing me any good. Pikul is now snapping together bits and pieces of bone, gristle and flesh, a grotesque Lego set. When he's finished, he's made a gun very much like the one that was used in the attempted assassination in the church. \nPIKUL Omigod, this looks awfully familiar. You sure this is OK? \nGELLER \n(NOT SURE) It should be OK. Now Pikul reaches into his mouth, pulls out a bridge of three teeth - one of them gold-filled - and loads them into the gristly magazine. \nGELLER Do you have that bridge in real life? \nPIKUL Absolutely not. My teeth are perfect. Don't ask me how I knew this thing was in my mouth. \nGELLER It probably wasn't until you ordered the special. He slaps the magazine into the handle, then pulls the slide back and releases it so that there is now a toothy round in the chamber. Then with a smile, Pikul points the weapon at Geller. \nPIKUL \n(CASUALLY) Death to the demoness Allegra Geller. \nGELLER (suddenly very uncertain) That's not funny! \nPikul looks at Geller and sees that there is genuine terror in her eyes. \nPIKUL Sorry, I couldn't resist. But you know... I do feel the urge to kill someone here. Geller grips the edge of her bowl of hot-and-sour soup - the handiest weapon she has. \nGELLER \n(TENSING) Who? \nPIKUL I need to kill our waiter. \nGELLER \n(RELIEVED) Oh, well, that makes sense. \n(CALLS OUT) Waiter! Waiter! \n(TO PIKUL) When he comes over, do it. Don't hesitate. \nPIKUL But everything in this game is so realistic. I don't think I really could... \nGELLER You won't be able to stop. You might as well enjoy it. \nNOURISH Yes. \n(MORE) \nOC \nNOURISH (CONT'D) \n(BITTERLY) Their corporate slogan should be, \"Enemies of Reality\". A glazed look comes over Pikul. He begins to speak like a robotic orator. \nPIKUL \n(ROBOT-LIKE) Reality is a fragile thing. Most people think that reality must of course be the most solid thing, but it isn't. Reality is threatened now more than ever. It is being eroded and it is washing away in the deforming storm of non-reality, which masquerades as reality, and eventually replaces it. Deformed and crippled and limping and hideous, threatening to engulf us all. Geller looks at Pikul in admiring disbelief. \nGELLER \n(SOTTO VOCE) Where did that come from? \nPIKUL The game made me do it. \nGELLER I'm impressed. Nourish is also impressed. He smiles broadly, then takes Pikul in his arms and hugs him, then Geller. \nNOURISH \n(PASSIONATE) We love you two now, now that you have proven to be true and trustworthy Realists. We'll be in touch. Nourish turns around and walks back-towards the restaurant. \nPIKUL \"Enemies of Reality\"? Or does it really mean, enemies of eXistenZ? Are the Realists the game-life version of the Anti- eXistenZialists, desperately want to kill you? \nS' \nGELLER I wouldn't take it too seriously. \nPIKUL 1 Of course you wouldn't. But maybe you should. \n(PAUSE) But why is the name Cortical Systematics familiar? \nGELLER We saw it everywhere in Dorsey Nader's game store, remember? \nPIKUL Yes. So that makes it the game- life version of our own company. Cortical Systematics is equivalent to Antenna Research in the real world. \nGELLER That's probably fair to say. \nPIKUL So, then, do we meekly go back to work and say nothing? It sounds as though Nourish and his Realists are preparing to sabotage the Trout Farm. Before you know it, they'll be planning to assassinate game designers. \nGELLER We're just characters in here. Don't mix your real-life loyalties into it or you'll lose for sure. \nPIKUL Then what do we do next? \nINT. GAME STORE - NIGHT \nWe are close on a Cortical Systematics logo on a game-pak. As Pikul and Geller pretend to examine the merchandise, they scan the game store for Nader. The store is quite crowded - same style of customers, maybe even some of the same faces, different clothes. They don't see Nader. Geller goes up to the cashier, the same gangly, sallow, bespectacled young man who was there the first time. \nCASHIER No, no. In fact, you would be useless to us without them. We Realists are forbidden to have them, and so we have to use people like you on occasion. \nGELLER I don't understand. Are you wanting us to jack a game into our bioports? \nCASHIER Game? No. Not a game. A weapon. (a creepy smile) You go back to the Trout Farm, and in a familiar place, you find a mouldy old wicker basket with a thread-bare canvas cover. \nPIKUL How will we know what to do? \nCASHIER (an even creepier' smile) Even a child would know what to do. Someone begins to knock loudly on a door very near by. The cashier is oblivious, but'both Pikul and Geller hear it. The stockroom begins to morph away as its objects are replaced one at a time by chalet objects. \nINT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT \nSomeone is knocking at the chalet door. \nVINOKUR (0. S. ) Sorry to interrupt you kids, but I thought you'd better have something to eat. We knocked on your door a few times to invite you to dinner... Pikul and Geller sit on the bed, game-pod between them, UmbyCord joining them to each other and to the pod. They look at each other. Pikul shrugs. \nGELLER Come on in. The door opens slowly to reveal Vinokur, who stands there uncertainly, holding a large tray. \nVINOKUR ..and when we got no answer, I figured you were playing eXistenZ to try out your new pod, and your new bioport. Everything's all right, I take it? An awkward moment, as though Vinokur has caught the pair having illicit sex. Vinokur moves into the room towards the table. \nVINOKUR Can I leave this here for you? Don't bother unporting. I just had to be sure our star designer was in a good place and that she'd recovered her multi- million-dollar game system from her defective pod. Vinokur puts down the tray, which holds several plates covered by smaller, inverted plates to keep the food warm. \nGELLER Thanks so much, Kiri. This is very sweet of you. \nVINOKUR \nI \n(AWKWARD PAUSE) So I take it she has. \nGELLER Has what? \nVINOXUR Recovered. eXistenZ. \nGELLER Oh, yes, sure. That's why we're so spaced out. \n(TO PIKUL) We were right into it, weren't we? \nPIKUL Yeah, we were. And it's amazing. \nVINOKUR Well, that's a relief. I'll leave you two alone. You can leave the tray outside your door when you're finished. \nPIKUL What is that you've brought? \nVINOKUR Believe it or not, it's Chinese food. There's a great Chinese restaurant on the other side of the escarpment road. Vinokur turns to go. \nGELLER Kiri? \nVINOKUR Yes? \nGELLER Have you heard anything yet? I mean, about the eXistenZ test seminar and the shooting? \nPIKUL Allegra, I'm worried that your game will wipe me off the face of the earth. I'm thinking I was right never to have a bioport installed. \nGELLER (sly, quick smile) But you have one now. And you're ported in. She mischievously flicks the pod nipple, and the chalet melts away around them. \nINT. TROUT FARM SECURITY - DAY \nTrout-farm workers shuffle along a murky pre-fab corridor towards a smoke-enshrouded security checkpoint. A puffy- faced woman with a clipboard is walking down the lineup checking faces and ID cards. With her we discover Pikul and Geller, once again wearing their ID cards which identify them as LARRY ASHEN and BARB BRECKEN. \nPIKUL That was cruel. I don't want to be here. \nGELLER It wasn't cruel, it was desperate. C'mon, Pikul. You've just got a bad case of first-time user anxiety. \nPIKUL I don't like it here. I don't know what's going on. We're blundering around together in this unformed world, whose rules and objectives are largely unknown, seemingly indecipherable, or even Possibly non-existent, always on the verge of being killed by forces we don't understand. \nGELLER That sounds like my game, all right. They are now close enough to the security cubicle'at the end of the corridor to see the workers ahead of them being frisked by hand, then scanned by a wand similar to the one that Pikul used at the church. \nPIKUL That sounds like a game that's not going to be easy to market. \nGELLER \n(LAUGHS) But it's a game that everybody's already playing! Existence, it's wonderful! \nINT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY LINE - DAY \nPikul and Geller have passed through security and now enter the assembly-line arena. They see Nourish at his accustomed place on the line, hunched over a pile of insect motherboards and now seeming, somehow, menacing, predatory in profile. The pair skirt the assembly-line area, carefully scanning as they go, but there is no wicker basket to be seen. \nINT. TROUT FARM. ASSEMBLY BAYS - DAY \nPikul and Geller walk down the aisle connecting the assembly bays. Other workers drift casually in and out, preparing for their day in a desultory fashion. \nPIKUL The cashier said it would be in a familiar place. Is there such a thing here? \nGELLER My assembly bay. They make their way to the last assembly bay and slip inside it. There is, for the moment, nobody else there, but several pods have been left on the work tables half-assembled. Pikul spots it first, in the far corner: a large, mouldy wicker basket in the opposite corner. Something lumpy in it is covered by a thread-bare canvas sheet. \nPIKUL Is that it over there? They stroll over to the basket. Geller kneels down and carefully begins to unwrap it while Pikul stands guard. \nGELLER I'd say it's exactly as advertised. The final wrap comes off. In the basket is a necrotic, purpled, very diseased-looking pod. \nPIKUL God, it's ugly. Even for a game- pod. \nGELLER \n(PAUSE) I have a terrible urge to port into it. What about you? \nPIKUL (he thinks she's joking) Oh, sure. Yes. Desperate to port into it. Geller steps over to a bunch of UmbyCords draped over a peg and strips one off. She sits down on a rotting wooden folding chair next to the death-pod's basket and ports in one end of the UmbyCord. \nGELLER Here we go. Wanna give me a hand? \nPIKUL \n(HORRIFIED) You're not serious! I mean, that's a diseased pod! Once you port into that, you become, you... you... \n(HORRIFIED) No, no! \nS: Gathering up her last shreds of energy, Geller suddenly shoves a startled Pikul off her cord and picks up the linoleum knife from where Pikul dropped it. Trailing her bloody cord, she lunges at Nourishi driving the rusty, curved blade into his back with great force. Nourish turns to Geller, the torch circling towards her, wavering. He tries to touch her with the flame, staggers. \nNOURISH \n(DYING) Death... death to the demoness Barb Brecken... to the... \nPIKUL Death to who? (he fingers his ID card) Oh, yeah... Barb... Nourish drops the torch, falls to the ground and snaps into the foetal position. A wall of flame roars up around him, fueled by the straw, wood, canvas, pod-oils. Pikul jumps over to Geller and picks up the trailing cord, twists it in his hands until it stops bleeding. All four walls of the assembly bay are on fire now. The doorway is a flapping sheet of flame. Mixing with the swelling rush of the flame are the sounds of the entire plant going on alert: yells, screams, sirens, running feet, doors being slammed open and closed. Pikul holds Geller tightly. She is limp, weak, drained in his arms. \nPIKUL I think we just lost the game. But now, strange, anomalous objects begin to appear out a nowhere in the flames - a chair, a tv set, a bath tub, a table, objects emerging into the game from the quest chalet. After a moment's confusion, Pikul smiles. \nPIKUL Or maybe not. And sure enough, the Trout Farm and its flames and its black cloud melt away. \nR \nIT \nINT. GUEST CHALET - NIGHT \nAs the guest chalet melts up around them, Pikul finds himself back on the bed, as he expected; but he is still embracing the swooning Geller, which he had not expected. \nPIKUL Allegra, we're back home. What's the matter, what's wrong? As Geller swims back up into full consciousness, she begins to talk, mumbling at first, then with terrible clarity. \nGELLER \n(BARELY COHERENT) Pikul. It's here, it's happened. It's come back here with us. We brought it back with us from eXistenZ. \nPIKUL Brought what back? I can't understand what you're saying. \nGELLER \n(WITH CLARITY) We brought the disease back with us. My pod is diseased. As though realizing the implications of what she's saying for the first time, Geller twists away from Pikul and begins to fumble with her UmbyJack. \nGELLER Oh God, I'm really going to lose it, I'm going to lose my game! Unport me! C'mon, unport me! Pikul unports her, then begins to tug at his own jack. When he takes a close look at the pod, he can see that it looks - unhealthy. Geller jumps off the bed and yanks open her bag on the table. She pulls out a tiny hypodermic syringe, unwraps it, flicks the bubbles out of it, falls to her knees beside the bed. \nGELLER \n(TO POD) I'm coming, I'm coming! Geller jabs the pod with the needle. As sne pushes in the plunger, she starts to massage it with her free hand, rub it, prod it. She's so close to it we think she might give it mouth-to-mouth. \nPIKUL But this can't be possible. How can a game event emerge into real life? \nGELLER \n(PANICKING) There's a very weird reality- bleed-through effect happening here. I'm not sure I get it. Pikul finally gets his UmbyCord unplugged. \nPIKUL What's in that needle? \nGELLER It's an anti-viral serum. It sometimes works if you get it in time. Unconsciously, Pikul scratches at his bioport. Geller fixes on him with strange intensity. \nGELLER Lemme see your bioport. \nGELLER I don't know! I don't know! The cashier strides into the room and pulls her to her feet. She tries to pick up her pod, but the cashier tugs her away from it. \nCASHIER Leave that rotting piece of meat here. It's done its job. Let it die. \nGELLER But my game! My game's inside it. I don't want my game to die. The cashier unslings his submachine gun, cocks it, and blows the pod into streaks of slime, flesh, and slivers of insect- board. Geller is in shock. Pikul turns her to face him, speaks' forcefully right into her face, shuts everything else out. \nPIKUL Allegra, listen to me. I think we're still inside the game. I think your real pod's out there somewhere, somewhere safe. I think it's OK to let go of this one, this pod. It's not the real one. A Molotov cocktail comes sailing into the room and shatters against the bed. The bed ignites with an explosive whump. \nCASHIER Everybody out! now! The three of them scramble out into the fiery night. \nEXT. CALEDON SKI-CLUB COMPOUND - NIGHT \nThe cashier leads Pikul and Geller out of the guest chalet and down the mountain path. The chalet next to theirs begins to implode as they scurry by it. As they flee, they realize that all the chalets are on fire. There are people trying to fight the fires, running r frantically everywhere with hand-held extinguishers. There is also scattered gunfire, but who's firing on whom is impossible to tell. \nEXT. HILLTOP - NIGHT \nThe cashier now leads them up to the top of a hill. \nCASHIER Up here. We can see everything from here. \nPIKUL What is it that we're seeing? \nCASHIER \n(GLEEFUL) The victory of Realism. And you were part of it. \nGELLER \n(DESOLATE) The death of eXistenZ. And we were part of it. The cashier turns on her with his gun. He snaps out his old clip and slams home a new one. He cocks the gun. \nCASHIER There's just one more thing. \nPIKUL \n(HORRIFIED) What are you doing? We're on your side. \nCASHIER \n(FIERCE) How could you be? How could Allegra Geller, the world's premiere game designer, be on our side? (off their bewildered \nLOOKS) Oh, Y93.' We know who you are. You can't hide inside a game forever. \nPIKUL Something's slipped over the edge, here, Allegra. Something's all wrong. \nCASHIER \n(SMILES) There. You see what I mean. You see the problem. \nThe cashier raises his gun to fire at Geller, but before he can pull the trigger, he jolts backwards and falls twitching to the ground. From the shadows of the trees, backlit by the fiery landscape below, steps Kiri Vinokur. In his hand he holds the gristle gun which Pikul assembled in the Chinese restaurant. \nVINOKUR I tried to find you. Thank God I got here in time. (pause; waggles the gun) My dog brought me this. \nPIKUL \n(QUIETLY) But Allegra. What if we're not in the game anymore? \nGELLER (confused, childlike) Huh? If... if we... we're not? \nPIKUL \n(STRANGELY HARD) If we're not, then you just killed someone real. A real person. \n(PAUSE) You see what can happen. It's important for me that you see that. \nGELLER Why? \nPIKUL (standing over her) It wasn't an accident that you and I ended up on the run together. \nGELLER Not an accident? Pikul hefts the submachine gun in his hands. \nPIKUL No. \nGELLER \n(COLD) That's why you never had a bioport. You were one of them. \nPIKUL I still am one of them. \nGELLER But you have a bioport now. \n(IRONIC) I thought that was forbidden to Anti-eXistenZialists. \nPIKUL I made the bioport sacrifice to get close to you, to make love to my enemy. \nGELLER Why would you do that? \nPIKUL To understand what I have to kill. \nGELLER \n(QUIETLY) Then. understand this. Geller produces a tiny electronic remote controller from the pocket of her shirt. \nGELLER Understand that I suspected who you were from the moment you made that fake phone call to yourself in the limo. Understand that I knew you were my real assassin when you pointed the gun at me in the Chinese restaurant. She flicks up a safety cover on the remote's tip, revealing a toggle switch. Pikul's hands tense around the submachine gun. \nGELLER And understand that you're dead. Geller flips the toggle switch. The base of Pikul's spine blows out, his shirt billowing with blood as his bioport explodes. \nA delighted Geller dances to her feet as Pikul staggers backwards. \nGELLER \n(GLEEFUL) Death to the demon Ted Pikul! His eyes frozen in a death stare, Pikul falls, rolls down the hill into the underbrush. Smoke creeping up from the fires below curls over him like a blanket. Arms raised in the air, Geller dances around on the top of the hill, looking down on the flames and the chaos. \nGELLER (confident, laughing) Have I won the game? Have I won? Have I won? The hill, the trees, the flames melt down around her. \nNOURISH \n(LAUGHS) Nice try, but you're going to have to turn them in because they're beta versions, pre- production hand-made specials, and we need to study them after use for wear and tear and other things. But you'll get a certificate for helping us out here - I'm right about that, aren't I, Merle? \nMERLE \n(NODDING ENTHUSIASTICALLY) And that will entitle you to reserve one of the first batch of the TranscendenZ by PilgrImage game modules to hit the market, and at a seriously discounted price. You're gonna love it. Amidst applause and general excitement, Merle turns to the tripod-mounted chalkboard standing, as in the first scene, at the back of the dais. There we see the words that she has already written: TranscendenZ by PilgrImage. \nMERLE Remember - it's written like this. Capital T, capital Z. TranscendenZ. It's new, it's from Pilgrimage - capital P. capital I, and it's coming soon. \nAllegra Geller now stands up, walks over to Nourish and gently takes his hand. He turns to see who's got him, then smiles broadly. \nGELLER \n(SHYLY) I'd just like to say thank you to Mr. Nourish for giving me the chance to play the role of a star designer. I guess the game picked up on my ambitions to be like you. \nNOURISH well, let me first say that I'm kinda glad I lost this game. I don't usually play such nasty characters. \n(LAUGHTER) And, Allegra, you were so good in that role that I suspect it won't be long before PilgrImage is after you to sign a designing contract. (applause and laughter) And maybe you should take your friend Ted, here, Mr. Pikul, with you. He's obviously good in a crisis, and when you design games, there are plenty of them. Amid the renewed good-natured laughter, Geller blushes. She reaches out for Pikul's hand. \nGELLER I guess you all could tell that Ted and I had a relationship prior to our coming here. We really do like to play together. \nPIKUL (shy but determined) We do, but I'd like to assure everybody here that Allegra wouldn't really jump into bed with a security guard unless he was me. (laughs from the security \nGUARDS) Merle holds out her hand in a gesture of appreciation towards Nourish. \nMERLE Well, what do we say to our brilliant, award-winning game designer, Yevgeny Nourish? Does he have another winner on his hands or not? \nPC Wild applause from all garners, including Geller and Pikul. \nMERLE All right, now, I have to ask you some questions, before the game half-life wears off. First, let me thank you for taking part in this test seminar. PilgrImage wants to deliver nothing but the finest to the game enthusiast, and you have all been a proud part of that process tonight. When we've collected all the head-sets and game modules, we'll be handing out a questionnaire to each of you, and I'd like your answers to the questions to be as honest, as brutal, as clear as you can make them. Don't hold back. After that, we're going to form a focus group where we'll discuss details of each of your experiences playing TranscendenZ. You've all had different but interlocking lives in the game, and I think you'll be amazed when you hear each other's stories. \nINT. COUNTRY CHURCH. MOMENTS LATER - NIGHT \nWhile the questionnaires are being handed out by the assistants, Nourish confers with Merle in a corner. \nNOURISH \n(INTENSE) Merle, I was very disturbed by the game we just played. \nMERLE What do you mean? \nNOURISH It had a very strong, very real anti-game theme. I mean, it began with the assassination of a game designer. \nMERLE or Really? But that's very creative. \n(PAUSE) But on second thought, I see what you mean. It makes me nervous. You think it must have come from one of our game players? \nNOURISH It sure didn't come from me. The tone of it in the game was very, very passionate, fanatical. And the atmosphere of paranoia and betrayal was overwhelming. The whole thing felt unstable, dangerous, volatile. But worse than that, there was a kind of industrial espionage subplot. Stealing game-systems, jumping ship from one game company to another. That kind of thing. They both reflexively begin to scan the gaming group, who are all innocently dealing with their question cards. \nMERLE So which one of them did these elements come from? \n", "test1_input": "EXISTENZ \nWritten by \nDavid Cronenberg \nFourth Draft October 1, 1996 \nINT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT \nThe man facing us is bearded, sweating, intense,'joyous. Jacket and tie, jeans, fortyish. His name is Wittold Levi. eXistenZ. Levi turns to a chalkboard on a tripod and writes the word. \nLEVI Written like this. One word. Small e. Capital X, capital Z. He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience. \nLEVI eXistenZ. It's new, it's from Antenna Research, and it's here, right now. We now see Levi's audience, about seventy-five people, some standing, some sitting on plastic folding chairs. They are of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and applaud enthusiastically. We are in the central playing area of a small, deconsecrated country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low, carpeted plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski boots. \nLEVI My name is Wittold Levi, my friends call me Witt - and I'm the project manager for eXistenZ. I recognize some familiar faces - that's all right, that's all right. We won't throw you out. We encourage consumer loyalty, and we want you to help us with our product testing. We're a team, Antenna and you. A delighted stir from the crowd. \nLEVI Those of you who have come to our invited seminars before will know that I normally lead the group through our new games, but \n(MORE) \nLEVI (CONT'D) tonight, it won't be me. No, for the test launch of eXistenZ by Antenna, we have brought you a seminar leader who is rather special. An unbelieving, excited stir. Could it really be? \nLEVI Yes, it is. The world's greatest game designer is here, in person, to lead you, the first test enclave, through her newest creation, eXistenZ by Antenna... The small crowd is now tremendously excited, wide-eyed, murmuring, one or two have actually gotten on their knees. \nLEVI I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess herself - Allegra Geller! Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into it until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to now has hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an electronic wand of some sort. His name-tag identifies him as Ted Pikul (rhymes with \"Michael\", not with \"pickle\"), and we will see more of him later. As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the crowd, her fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part like water as she passes amongst them, clutching her own personal game-pod case with both hands. She mounts the dais like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog. Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is bright, acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she speaks, she is deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic. \nGELLER The world of games is in a kind of a trance. People are programmed to accept so little, but the possibilities are so great. \n(PAUSE) You probably thought that tonight, we were going to test a new game that I designed. Excited murmurings from the crowd. \nGELLER But there is no new game to test, at least, not in the usual sense. Confused, slightly disappointed mutterings. \nGELLER No, no, it's going to be much better than you expected, because eXistenZ is not just a game. It's an entirely new game system. Antenna Research and I developed it together - the eXistenZ System by Antenna - and it involves a whole lot of new toys, which you are going to be the first to try out. The crowd's spirit rises again. Levi steps forward, smiling, playing off the renewed energy. \nLEVI MetaFlesh. Levi turns to the chalkboard and writes the word. \nLEVI Written like this. One word. Capital M, capital F. MetaFlesh is what our new toys are made of - the MetaFlesh Game-Pod, only from Antenna Research. It connects with any industry standard bioport, which I know you all have or you wouldn't be here... (chuckles from the crowd) .using, however, a very non- standard connecting device which we call... Levi turns again to the chalkboard. \nLEVI .we call an UmbyCord. Spelled like this. Levi writes the word out and then turns back to his by-now- salivating audience. \nLEVI I guess you can tell I started off as a schoolteacher. \n4 (APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES) But I never had anything quite so fun or so revolutionary to teach as what Allegra and I are going to teach you all tonight. With a theatrical flourish, Levi whirls around to face his two assistants, who have finished laying out their devices on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention at either end of it. \nLEVI Are the MetaFlesh Game-Pods by Antenna Research ready? \nASSISTANTS \n(TOGETHER) Yes, Mr; Levi. \n", "test1_true": "FEMALE ASSISTANT Twenty-one, Mr. Levi. Levi's face clouds slightly. The audience does not hear the following exchange. \nLEVI \n(SOTTO VOCE) Twenty-one? I thought we had an even two dozen. \nMALE ASSISTANT The first three we opened were... unhealthy. \nLEVI Really? Any chance that some of the others...? \nFEMALE ASSISTANT We think we're clean. \nLEVI \nJ \n(RESTRAINED FURY) God-damn better be. Levi turns back to his audience, radiant once more. \nLEVI We have twenty-one prototype MetaFlesh Game-Pods, and that means that for our first wave test enclave we need twenty-one volunteers who will port in these slave units with the Game-Pod Goddess herself... Levi doesn't need to finish his pitch. Every hand is waving in the air, and every pair of lips is saying, \"Me, me, oh God, please, let it be me!\" Geller can only stand by modestly and beam at the intensity of the small crowd's enthusiasm. \nINT. COUNTRY CHURCH. MINUTES LATER - NIGHT \nA SHORT MONTAGE as the twenty-one volunteers mount the dais and are fitted with their game gear: The assistants undo the heavy-duty snap locks and split open the ski-boot-like plastic modules on the back table. Inside, resting in a lining of dense foam, are what look almost like living kidneys: the MetaFlesh Game-Pods. Coiled in each boot toe is the Y-shaped, multi-player UmbyCord that comes with each pod, a split twelve-foot connector cord that resembles an umbilical cord, twisted, translucent, blue and red veiny vessels running just below the surface. The volunteers watch in hushed reverence, as though about to receive communion. The game-pods are gingerly lifted out of their cases. The UmbyCords are uncoiled and plugged into ports in the back of the game-pods. The shirts, blouses, and jackets of the volunteers are lifted at the back to reveal their owners' bioports, which are small, soft-plastic, flesh-coloured permanent spinal jacks positioned just above the belt line. Twenty-two folding chairs are placed in a circle on the dais. As each volunteer has his UmbyCord plugged into his bioport, he takes one of the seats and places his quivering, rippling game-pod, now connected directly to his nervous system, on his lap. \nThe last chair is taken by Allegra Geller, who is fussed i over and settled by Levi as she unpacks her own master game- pod with exaggerated delicacy and is then ported in to the players on either side of her. We END the short MONTAGE with the security guard, Pikul, standing with arms folded near the church's side door, watching the proceedings with fascination. A loud knocking at the door forces Pikul to turn away from the action on the dais. He walks over to the door and opens it. A hyper, exasperated fan almost tumbles into the church. Pikul immediately raises his electronic wand and bars his way. \nPIKUL Hold it. Not so fast. In response, the fan thrusts a card at him. Pikul takes the card, a complex invitation card which includes a holographic photo of the fan under which floats his name, Joel Dichter. Dichter anxiously looks past Pikul into the depths of the church, nervously adjusting the vinyl case slung over his shoulder. \nDICHTER Oh, god. I hope I'm not too late. Did I miss the port-in? \nPIKUL It's just the first wave. You can be part of the second wave. (rereads the invitation) OK, Joel Dichter. Put your arms up. I have to scan you. Metal and heavy synthetics can't come in. \nDICHTER \n(INCREDULOUS) A weapons check? \nPIKUL More for recording devices. Lotta money invested in these games. Industrial espionage happens. What's in this case? \nDICHTER I brought my game-pod. It's got original Marway tissue architecture. It's kind of obsolete but I was hoping,... \n(MORE) \nDICHTER (CONT'D) even though I couldn't afford the Antenna Fifteen upgrade, I figured out a method of virtual porting that I thought might... Pikul uses his wand to scan the vinyl case, then opens the zipper and feels around. In the case is a more solid, rubbery version of the new MetaFlesh pods. \nPIKUL You won't need it tonight. Everything's provided for. Dichter suddenly spots Geller on the dais. He almost faints. \nDICHTER Migod! Is that who I think it is? \n.PIKUL (with paternal pride) Yeah, that's her. She's something, isn't she? \n", "test1_id": 2115, "test2_input": "DICHTER But why would a star like her come to a product seminar in a little one-horse town like this? \nPIKUL This is where the real people live, Joel. Her real fans, like you. \nDICHTER Yeah, well, you said it. Just like me. Dichter has scanned OK. Pikul waves him into the church to join the spectators who will form the second wave and re- locks the door. On the dais, in the center of the circle of linked game players, Levi nods at Geller. \nLEVI Everything's in order. Are you ready, Allegra? \nT \nGELLER \n(PUMPED) Sure. This is my favourite part. \nThere is giddy laughter in the room. Geller looks at every player-in the circle as Levi steps down off the platform and retires to the far edge of the small, watching throng. \nGELLER I'm ready to download eXistenZ by Antenna Research into you all now. I'm warning you, it's going to be a wild ride, but don't panic no matter what happens. I'll see you all back here in no time at all. Now the giddy laughter goes a touch nervous, uncertain, but it's too late. Geller depresses a nipple-like protuberance on the game-pod on her lap, and all the players close their eyes and go rigid, like members of a seance who have suddenly been contacted by the spirit world. The pods in their laps begin a rhythmic, peristaltic rippling. At the edge of the crowd, Pikul sidles up to Levi. \nPIKUL \n(TO LEVI) She seems to be very shy. It never occurred to me that a big star would be shy. \nLEVI She spends most of her time alone in a room designing her games. I think she'd like it best if she never had to show them to anybody. \nPIKUL Really? She doesn't enjoy all the adulation? \nLEVI She hates having to port in with her fans. It's too intimate. \nPIKUL Then why does she do it? \nLEVI \n(LAUGHS) We make her do it. \nI D \nPIKUL By \"we\" you mean, the game company, Antenna Research? \nA \nLEVI ' That's what I mean. \nPIKUL Why? \nI \nLEVI \n(SUDDENLY SUSPICIOUS) Are you with us or did an independent security company send you? \nPIKUL Me? Oh, I'm with your own management training program. (shows him a card) I want to end up in marketing and public relations. (holds up security wand) The only thing I know about security is how to switch this thing on. \n", "test2_true": "(SATISFIED) Well, for example, we've spent a fortune developing eXistenZ, but we all know it's a risky project. She might have to make changes. It's the only way we can convince her that there might be a problem. \nPIKUL \n(PUZZLED) A problem with her new game? \nLEVI eXistenZ is a lot more than a game. \nPIKUL Yeah, right, it's a game system. I heard that. \nLEVI And we're worried that it's too intellectual, too complex, too weird, too artsy. That argument ; never bothers her until she faces her fans. She hates to be rejected in the flesh, so we make her come out sometimes to take the heat. \nPIKUL \n(ADMIRINGLY) 4 I've heard that she's very sensitive. A strange, choral humming begins to fill the church. Pikul and Levi turn their attention to the dais, where the fans rock and sway with the pulsing of the pods in their laps. \nPIKUL What are they doing? \nLEVI \n(LAUGHS) It's the new Antenna Research theme song. We thought this would be a good way to launch it. Everybody who plays eXistenZ is going to be very familiar with that tune. Haltingly, but gamely, Pikul tries to hum along. \nPIKUL Catchy. Levi helps him out, and soon the whole room is humming along happily, warmed by the Antenna Research corporate theme song. The whole room, that is, except for Joel Dichter, who, at the edge of the dais, is more concerned with fumbling around in the vinyl pod-case hanging from his shoulder. In the case, we watch as Dichter tears open his obsolete game-pod to reveal a bizarre weapon, a pistol made of bone and gristle, almost like the half-decayed body of a small mammal - whose snout is the barrel, whose rigid hind leg is the trigger. Dichter takes his weapon out of its case, shakes off a few gelatinous strips of game-pod flesh, and steps up onto the dais. Pikul is the first to notice this. He glances at Levi, who's still blissed out and humming, then launches himself awkwardly through the crowd. Now in the middle of the circle, Dichter makes his way towards the blissfully unsuspecting Geller, raising his weapon as he goes. \nDICHTER Death to eXistenZ! Death to Antenna Research! Death to the demoness Allegra Geller! \nP \nPIKUL \n(TO DICHTER) No! Don't do it! Dichter turns to see Pikul stumbling through the small crowd, scrambling onto the dais. Distracted, Dichter hurriedly raises his weapon again and fires it at Geller. The first shot hits her in the shoulder and spins her off her chair, which collapses over her and takes the second bullet on its seat rim. The circle of players on the dais moans as one, swoons and jostles: they are all feeling the neural surge of Geller's traumatized nervous system. Peeking out from under her folding chair, Geller's eyes are wide with fear and confusion. She clutches her shoulder without being aware of it. Blood seeps in between her fingers Now Levi and his two assistants scramble onto the platform to get at Dichter, who fires wildly, hitting two of the players nearest Geller. The circle of players immediately goes spastic, screaming and twitching and dropping to the ground and writhing. Many of them are clutching their shoulders in the same spot as Geller, sympathy pain transmitting through their UmbyCords. Pikul manages to tackle Dichter, then starts whacking at him with the security wand. Dichter twists around and raises his weapon at Pikul, who immediately backs off in terror. But before Dichter can pull the trigger, the two assistants produce small, normal pistols from hidden holsters and empty their clips into the prostrate Dichter. Dichter manages to squeeze off one last shot at the approaching Jevi, hitting him squarely in the chest. Levi goes down and is lost amongst the jostling feet. The watching fans pile onto the dais and begin to help the players unplug from the game-pods which are obviously causing them distress. Three of the players attack the dying Dichter, dragging their game-pods after them, kicking at whatever part of him they can find in the confused mass of bodies. in the turmoil, Pikul is knocked to the ground. Amid the stamping, sliding feet, he finds himself lying across the stricken-Levi. Levi clutches Pikul desperately. \nLEVI Get her out of here! Save her! There might be more of them! Go on! \nPIKUL Me? Me take her? \nLEVI (urgent, pleading) We have enemies in our own house. Trust no one. Trust no one... The wide-eyed Pikul scrambles to his feet and promptly trips over the all-but-dead Dichter. He falls painfully to his knees, struggles up again, and finds the bizarre bone gun in his hand. Pikul stares at it, fascinated, horrified. He turns back to Levi, but Levi's eyes are rolling back as he loses consciousness. The two assistants are making their way towards them through the shoving, shuffling throng, guns cocked, faces set hard. Panicked, Pikul jams the bone gun into his suit pocket and jumps off the platform, wildly looking around for Geller. She and her chair have slipped off the dais in a heap only a few feet away, and she is in several kinds of agony. Pikul unports her, which immediately brings her some relief and a lot of clarity. Pikul wards off a couple of fans with one arm, screams at them. \nPIKUL \n(SCREAMS) She's coming with me! I'm responsible for her! She's supposed to come with me! To his surprise, Geller laughs a dazed, hearty laugh. \nGELLER \n(LAUGHS) Am I? With you? \nPIKUL (quietly, firmly) Yeah, you're coming with me. Pikul pulls her to her feet, but she immediately dives back to the floor to find her game-pod and UmbyCord. \nGELLER (suddenly near hysteria) I can't lose this! I can't lose this! She finds the game-pod still under the folding chair, a bit flattened on one side but in one piece. She grabs the game- pod and its UmbyCord and stuffs them into her MetaFlesh pod case which has been knocked to the edge of the dais. As she clutches it to her, Pikul takes her hand and hauls her through the crowd, which is now spilling off the overcrowded dais and clutching at Geller fitfully, like Velcro. They head for the door, fighting everybody off as though they might be lethal. As they leave through the side door, Pikul sees five or six fans, shrieking like monkeys, still stomping and kicking the body of Dichter viciously, hysterically, while Levi's two assistants carry him to the safety of the church's apse. \n", "test2_id": 2116, "test3_input": "EXT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT \nPikul and Geller spew out of the doorway and find themselves standing alone in the weedy parking lot of the church. The church itself stands isolated on a country road just outside a town which is not much more than two gas stations and a crossroad. Pikul and Geller look around wildly. The vehicles in the parking lot are country, pickup trucks, rusted vans, 4x4s. Across the road, aloof, maybe too high-class for the parking lot, sits a Land Rover Defender 110, the one with the roof cage and the seven seats and the winch hanging off the front. Geller gestures towards the Defender. \nGELLER Let's take my limo. \nPIKUL \n(WILD) No, no! \nGELLER Why no? \nPIKUL I don't trust the driver! \nGELLER You drive, idiot! \nThey cross the road and jump in the Defender. Frances, the driver, sixtyish, a retired lady farmer who moonlights, is apprehensive. \nFRANCES What's the commotion, Miss Geller? Say, are you all right? What's goin' on in there? \nGELLER We need this vehicle, and we need it without you. But with the keys. \nFRANCES I can't do that. I can't abandon my vehicle. Geller pulls the weird gun out of an astonished Pikul's pocket. She points it at Frances. \nGELLER Get out, Frances. You can say you were hijacked. \nFRANCES \n(CHUCKLES) It'll take more than a dead squirrel to get me out of this seat. Geller fires two shots. One rips a hole in Frances's headrest. \nFRANCES (getting out of her seat) You have to push the shift lever down to get it into reverse. \nGELLER Thanks, Frances. They drive off down the country road, leaving Frances in the dust. \nINT. DEFENDER LIMO - NIGHT \nPikul drives. He can see why the limo is an off-road vehicle: the road is terrible, dirt and gravel, stutter potholes and sharp ridges, the occasional fallen tree. \nPIKUL (manic, scared) I normally like the countryside, don't you? Normally, the country is relaxing and calm. \nGELLER Only if you don't really know what's going on. \nPIKUL What do you mean? \nGELLER There is great stress and anger and violence in the countryside. Thousands of life forms all screaming ME ME ME and trying to kill and dominate and devour the other life forms. It's terrifying and exhausting. \nPIKUL \n(LAMELY) Well, I like the countryside. \nGELLER That's good, `cause you might end up spending a lot of time here. \n", "test3_true": "GELLER Sure. If you go back home to the city, they'll probably be waiting for you. \nPIKUL They? \nGELLER Yeah. My assassins. They'd want to have a little talk with you about where I am. \nPIKUL I was hoping that was just one crazy guy. \nGELLER Did you hear the way he screamed at me? He wasn't alone. \nPIKUL Everybody likes a conspiracy. It's more satisfying than just one crazy guy doing one crazy thing. Geller goes silent. \nPIKUL Well, what are we going to do out here? Do you know your way around? You know any country people? \nGELLER Not country people. Games people. The countryside's full of games development people, project co- ordinators, little factories - you name it. \nPIKUL That's weird. I never knew that. \nGELLER The city's full of bad microwaves, bad thermals, bad electro-optics. You can't shield from it anymore. You can't get true readings. The whole industry moved out of the city years ago. \nPIKUL So you know your way around. We can hide out. \nGELLER Maybe. But it seems I have some enemies I didn't know I had. \"Death to Allegra Geller.\" How'd you like to hear somebody with a gun screaming, \"Death to Ted Pikul\"? \nPIKUL Wow. (reflective pause; then) Hey, how'd you know my name? \nGELLER (indicating his name tag) You're labelled. \nPIKUL Oh. Yeah. \n(PAUSE) How did you know how to fire that, gun? I've never seen anything like it. \nGELLER It has a trigger. I pulled it. \nPIKUL Can I see it? \nGELLER Later. I think I'm gonna use it in my next game. If there ever is a next game. Pikul glances at her. He hits a pothole and she bounces around in her seat, exposing her far shoulder to him. Her shirt is soaked with blood. \nPIKUL Migod, you're bleeding. I forgot you got hit. There is an urgent buzzing from somewhere in Pikul's breast pocket. \nGELLER What's that? \nPIKUL It's my pink-fone. I'm not sure I should answer it. \nGELLER Answer it. Pikul pulls the pink-fone - it's soft surgical plastic, palm-sized - out of his pocket. When he squeezes it open, a diffuse pink light swells up from deep inside it. \nPIKUL \n(INTO PHONE) Ted Pikul. \n", "test3_id": 2117}

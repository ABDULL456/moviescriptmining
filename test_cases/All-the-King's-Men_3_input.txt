Willie takes a seat on the children's swing as Jack goes off to get some coffee. Two little girls stare curiously at him. Willie waves them off. Jack returns with the coffee and pours some whisky in it. Willie tips his hand, forcing him to pour more, then gulps his drink down. 
Exterior: Bandstand (Upton), Day 
Duffy, Pillsbury, and the other politicians stand on the platform, waiting for Willie. A band plays march music. Duffy goes over to Sadie, who is standing on the steps of the platform. 
DUFFY Where is he? 
SADIE (pointing) There he is. 
Escorted by Jack, Willie approaches the platform and stumbles up the steps past Sadie. 
SADIE Whoops! 
DUFFY (to Jack) Is he drunk? 
JACK Never touches the stuff. Lucy doesn't favor drinkin'. 
Duffy follows Willie up on the platform. 
SADIE (to Jack) How'd you get him here? He was out stiff. 
JACK Hair of the dog that bit him. 
SADIE Hair? He must have swallowed the dog. 
On the platform, Duffy looks uneasily at the bleary-eyed Willie. The band suddenly plays a fanfare, and the chairman steps up to the microphone. 
CHAIRMAN Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce to you that true man of the people, the next governor of the state... Willie Stark. 
There is scattered applause as Willie steps forward to speak. 
WILLIE My friends... 
He turns his face from side to side, and fumbles in the right side of his coat pocket to fish out his speech. 
WILLIE My friends... I... 
He tries to focus on the speech, which he clutches before his eyes with both hands. Then he lifts his head, and looks directly at the people who have come to hear him. As he speaks, the camera focuses on the faces of these people: the farmers, workers, hicks, red-necks who are Willie's audience, Willie's people. 
WILLIE I have a speech here. It's a speech about what this state needs. There's no need in my telling you what this state needs. You are the state and you know what you need... You over there... look at your pants. Have they got holes in the knees? Listen to your stomach. Did you ever hear it rumble from hunger?... And you, what about your crops? Did they ever rot in the field because the road was so bad you couldn't get them to market?... And you. What about your kids? Are they growing up ignorant as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause there's no school for them?... No, I'm not going to read you any speech. 
He throws his speech away. Duffy looks alarmed. 
WILLIE But I am going to tell you a story. It's a funny story... 
SADIE (from the steps) Hey! 
WILLIE'S VOICE ...So get ready to laugh. 
SADIE What's he up to? 
JACK Shut up! 
WILLIE Get ready to bust your sides laughing, 'cause it's sure a funny story. It's about a hick... a hick like you, if you please. Yeah, like you. He grew up on the dirt roads and gully washes of a farm. He knew what it was to get up before dawn and get feed and slop and milk before breakfast... and then set out before sunup and walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick knew what it was to be a hick, all right. He figured if he was going to get anything done, he had to do it himself. So he sat up nights and studied books. He studied law because he thought he might be able to change things some... for himself, and for folks like him. 
Sugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's speech. 
WILLIE No, I'm not going to lie to you. He didn't start off thinking about the hicks and all the wonderful things he was going to do for them. No. No, he started off thinking of number one. But something came to him on the way. How he could do nothing for himself without the help of the people. That's what came to him. And it also came to him, with the powerful force of God's own lightning, back in his home country, when a schoolhouse collapsed because it was built of politics... rotten brick. It killed and mangled a dozen kids. But you know that story. The people were his friends because he fought that rotten brick. And some of the politicians down in the city, they knew that... So they rode up to his house in a big, fine, shiny car and said as how they wanted him to run for governor... 
Jack, electrified, grips Sadie's arm. 
JACK Sadie, he's wonderful... wonderful... 
Duffy fidgets as Willie continues to pace and speak, his face filled with conviction, and with fury. 
WILLIE ...So they told the hick... and he swallowed it. He looked in his heart and he thought in all humility how he'd like to try and change things. He was just a country boy who thought that even the plainest, poorest man can be governor if his fellow citizens find he's got the stuff for the job. Well, those fellows in the striped pants... they saw the hick and they took him in. 
He points his finger at Duffy, who is coming over to speak to him. 
DUFFY (low voice) Willie, what are you trying to do? 
Willie turns on him, roaring. 
WILLIE There he is! There's your Judas Iscariot. (he pushes Duffy across the platform) Look at him... lickspittle... nose- wiper. 
Duffy gestures frantically to the band. 
DUFFY Play! Play! 
WILLIE (pushing him again) Look at him! 
DUFFY Play anything. 
The band starts to play, adding to the pandemonium. Willie shouts above it. 
WILLIE Look at him! Joe Harrison's dummy! Look at him!

STEPHEN (CONT'D) The universe born from a black hole exploding. 
SCIAMA (FINALLY) Keep going. 
STEPHEN Keep going? You mean go further back, Professor? Before the universe began? 
SCIAMA Keep going. Develop the mathematics. 
STEPHEN I don't know how. 
SCIAMA takes the KEY for the RUTHERFORD LAB out of the drawer and hands it to him. 
INT. RUTHERFORD LAB LECTURE HALL 
STEPHEN writes, inspired, formula on the famous blackboard. He stops, thinks, continues, then deletes a bit, and writes again, faster, faster, his mind racing, even as his fingers begin to betray him, growing weaker, weaker... 
EXT. TRINITY HALL, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY 
The swirl of CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY life. Dons on bicycles. Purposeful students. Every building looking like a STATELY HOME. 
STEPHEN walks quickly and excitedly, with still CHALKY FINGERS, across campus but then suddenly, trips - FALLS - falls hard. His head smashing onto the hard paving stones. His GLASSES fly off his face. He is unconscious immediately. 
STUDENTS rush to his aid. 
MONTAGE: 
A) X-RAY DEPARTMENT. STEPHEN, his face GRAZED and BRUISED, lies on a tilting bed as X-rays are taken. 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   27 
CONTINUED: 
B) Blood is taken from his arm. 
C) In a PUBLIC WARD, STEPHEN, sitting on the edge of a bed in a HOSPITAL SMOCK, turns and looks at a SICK YOUNG MAN in the next bed, who looks GRAVELY ILL. 
D) Dexterity Test - Stephen struggles to bring his little finger to meet his thumb. Stephen, lying down, as the doctor violently jerks his knee up. Stephen lying prone in foetal postion as a doctor performs a lumbar puncture and extracts fluid from his spine. 
STEPHEN What is it? What's wrong with me? 
E) STEPHEN lies in the PUBLIC WARD while the SICK YOUNG MAN in the next bed is discovered DEAD. Nurses rush the SICK YOUNG MAN away, as STEPHEN watches. He is very moved by this. 
F) INT. WARD/ HOSPITAL - DAY 
The DOCTOR is dismissive and unsentimental. 
SENIOR DOCTOR It's called motor neuron disease. 
STEPHEN What's that? 
The DOCTOR, despite his unsentimental nature, draws a deep breath. This is not the speech he wants to make... 
SENIOR DOCTOR It's a progressive neurological disorder that destroys the cells in the brain that control essential muscle activity such as speaking, walking--breathing-- swallowing. The signals that muscles must receive in order to move are disrupted, cut off. The result is--gradual muscle decay, a wasting away. Eventually, the ability to control voluntary movement is--lost--entirely. 
SHOCK sets in as STEPHEN watches other patients taking EXERCISE, stretching - walking. 
STEPHEN Is--is--is there a cure? Some--? Is--can you--? 
SENIOR DOCTOR Improvement should not be expected. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   28 
CONTINUED: SENIOR DOCTOR (CONT'D) (PAUSE) I'm afraid average life expectancy is two years. 
STEPHEN is rocked to the core by this news - 
SENIOR DOCTOR (CONT'D) There's nothing I can do for you, I'm terribly sorry. 
Silence. The SENIOR DOCTOR rises to go - 
STEPHEN Wait! What about--what about the brain? 
SENIOR DOCTOR The brain isn't affected. Your thoughts won't change--it's just- 
STEPHEN What? 
SENIOR DOCTOR Eventually--no-one will know what they are. (BEAT) Ever so sorry. 
The DOCTOR walks away.

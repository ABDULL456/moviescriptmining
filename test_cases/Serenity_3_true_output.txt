SIMON Show us what? Who is Miranda? 
(BEAT) Am I... talking to Miranda now? Nwï¿½ She shoots him a look. 
RIVER I'm not a multiple, dumbo. 
SIMON No. Right. But I think somehow when they triggered you it brought this up, this memory -- 
RIVER It isn't mine. The memory. I didn't bring it and I shouldn't have to carry it, it isn't mine. 
(URGENTLY:) Don't make me sleep again. 
SIMON I won't. 
RIVER Put a bullet to me. Bullet in the brain pan, squish. 
SIMON Don't say that. Not ever. We'll get through this. She reaches out and touches his face, affectionately. 
RIVER Things are going to get much much worse. 
SIMON Well, the Captain hasn't tossed us in the airlock, so I'd say we're -- 
RIVER He has to see. More than anyone... he has to see what he doesn't want to. 
SIMON River. What will Miranda show us. She thinks. 
VD 
RIVER Death. 
SIMON Whose death? And she starts laughing. Quietly at first, then louder, then almost uncontrollably, screaming in his face: 
RIVER 
EVERYBODY'S!!! 
SMASH CUT TO: Black Silence. 
INT. CAVE - DAY 
It's pitch black here, til Serenity's lights throw a hard relief on the rocky wall. She flies in after, slow and steady, revealing herself to be in a huge mineshaft. 
BOOK (O.S.) Lord, I am walking your way. ANGLE: THE RAMP lowers to reveal Shepherd BOOK, a working- class preacher and former crew member. He smiles as they come out to meet him: 
NOO BOOK (O.S.) 
(CONTINUING) Let me in, for my feet are sore, my clothes are ragged. 
EXT. MINING CAMP - DAY 
We see the camp: a few shacks and a working mine, as our group come down to it, greeted by a few miners, including an eight year old boy that rushes to Kaylee... ANGLE ON: A CANNON mounted at the edge of town. The guy manning it sees them arrive, also goes to greet them. 
INT. COMMUNITY KITCHEN - NIGHT 
We see the gang sitting and eating. Comfortable, even laughing a bit. Jayne presents Book with a couple of cigars. Kaylee hoists the boy on her lap. 
BOOK (O.S. ) Look in my eyes, Lord, and my sins will play out on them as on a screen. Read them all. 
EXT. MINING CAMP - NIGHT 
Mal approaches Book on the edge of a rise overlooking the town. Mal has a bowl and chopsticks. Book is finishing: 
V0 
BOOK Forgive what you can, and send me on my path. I will walk on, until you bid me rest. 
MAL Hope that ain't for me, Shepherd. 
BOOK (lighting a cigar) It's prayer for the dead. 
MAL Then I really hope it ain't for me. 
BOOK It's for the men River might have killed in that bar.

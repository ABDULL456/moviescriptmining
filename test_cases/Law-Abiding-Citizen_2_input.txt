56   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             56 
A GIANT EYEBALL stares at us, unnaturally magnified by a tabletop magnifier. The lens is swept aside, revealing: 
Benson Clyde. In addition to the tabletop magnifier, he's wearing MAGNIFYING LENSES on his head. He examines the figurine with his naked eye, then flips the glasses down to continue... 
57   EXT. COUNTRY HIGHWAY - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                       57 
VEHICLES race along two-lane blacktop: CRUISERS, UNMARKED CARS, TACTICAL VANS. A POLICE HELICOPTER skims along just above them at scary-low altitude... 
The cars veer off pavement and up a dirt road, kicking up an awesome trail of dust as the copter sweeps wide, pacing... 
58   INT. CARS - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                                  58 
Tense faces: Dunnigan, Garza, Nick. 
WHITE   -   9-7-8                                           35. 
59   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             59 
Clyde pauses, hearing a RUMBLE under the music. Glances up as the rumble passes overhead -- a helicopter? He clicks on a tiny fan, holds the figurine under it, giving it a final dry. 
60   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             60 
A shitstorm descends: vehicles swerving in, COPS jumping out, machine gun-toting SWAT TACTICAL TROOPS pouring from vans... 
61   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY (SONG CONTINUES)                             61 
Clyde, still holding the figurine under the whirring fan, leans to one side in his chair, glancing out the window. 
He glimpses scurrying figures behind cars, cops darting and surrounding the house, motioning with hand signals... 
He holds up the figurine for a final look. Satisfied with it, he places it onto: 
A CHESSBOARD -- the last piece. All the others are also hand- painted, gorgeous. Real craftsmanship here. 
He stands. Calmly moves to the middle of the room. Kicks off his shoes. Peels off his shirt and undershirt. Even takes off his pants. There will be no confusion about hidden weapons. 
He positions himself, very precise and purposeful. Lifts his hands high above his head. Presenting himself. Waiting. 
Then, bam: doors EXPLODE in and windows SHATTER as the SWAT tactical troops storm the room, bad-asses in black, machine guns aimed, encircling him, everybody shouting: 
SWAT TROOPS DO NOT MOVE--FREEZE MOTHERFUCKER-- DON'T EVEN TWITCH--WE WILL FIRE UPON YOU--LET'S SEE THOSE HANDS-- 
Clyde is the calm eye of a pissed-off storm of highly professional cops with itchy trigger fingers. He remains serene, looking around at them, hands raised high... 
SWAT CAPTAIN ON THE FLOOR! FACE DOWN! DO IT NOW! 
He compliantly goes to his knees, then prone, offers his hands behind his back. They move in, cuff him, as troops spread throughout the house yelling "Clear!" 
62   EXT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                              62 
Nick, wearing his kevlar, follows Dunnigan and Garza. Nick glances over and sees a perfect 1965 midnight-blue Lincoln Continental in the carport... 
BLUE   -   9-19-08                                          36. 
63   INT. FARMHOUSE - DAY                                              63 
Clyde is pulled to his feet just as Nick enters. UNIFORMS spread out, securing the house. Dunnigan faces Clyde... 
DUNNIGAN Benson Clyde. You have the right to remain silent... 
...as the full Miranda is read, Nick and Clyde have their eyes locked throughout -- this moment is all about them... 
DUNNIGAN ...understand your rights as I have explained them? 
CLYDE Yes. 
Clyde is hustled outside, leaving Nick with Dunnigan and Garza in the farmhouse -- it's renovated, clean, very loft-like. 
Nick drifts to the table, sees the chess board, can't help admiring the pieces. Then his eyes go to a floor-to-ceiling bookcase. He's stunned to realize: they're all law books. 
GARZA (O.S.) Check this shit out. 
Nick turns, moves to Garza's side. Dunnigan joins them. All three staring at a wall. ANGLE SHIFTS around to reveal: 
The long-ago PHOTO (clipped from a newspaper) of Nick and Clarence Darby shaking hands on the courthouse steps. 
ANGLE WIDENS to reveal: 
Photo after photo. The crime scene photos...photos of Clyde and his family in happier times...photos clipped from magazines and newspapers about the murder and trial...all very neatly and precisely arrayed. The entire wall covered with them. 
THE MUSIC KEEPS BOOMING from the record player. Dunnigan turns     * TIGHT TO CAMERA and yells: 
DUNNIGAN CAN SOMEBODY TURN THAT FUCKING MUSIC OFF, PLEASE? 
64   INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY                              64 
Clyde sits alone and isolated in a small room. WIDEN to reveal Sarah at the observation glass. She turns as Nick steps up. 
SARAH He says he'll only talk to you. 
WHITE   -    9-7-8                                         37. 
Nick and Dunnigan prepare to go in. Dunnigan takes off his gun and holster, lays them on a table, as Garza activates the VIDEO. Cantrell finds a chair by feel, sits down, as:

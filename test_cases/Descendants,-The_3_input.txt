VERY CLOSE ON MATT -- 
MATT (V O.) (CONT'D) I just want to be a normal guy. 
24   EXT. DOWNTOWN HONOLULU - DAY                                         24

25   INT. MATT'S LAW OFFICE - DAY                                      25 
Matt eats a SACK LUNCH at his desk. His window has a grand view of DOWNTOWN. We glimpse his Punahou, college and law school DIPLOMAS. 
MATT (V.O.) Unlike a lot of my cousins, I haven't touched my share of the trust money. Like my father before me, I live only on the income from my law practice. I don't want my daughters growing up entitled and spoiled. And I agree with my father -- you give your children enough money to do something but not enough to do nothing. 
Matt's secretary NOE cracks open his door. 
NOE Mr. King, your cousins are here. 
26   INT. LAW OFFICE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY                             26 
Matt enters the room to find SEVEN COUSINS waiting to greet him. From their casual clothing and shaggy hair, an observer might hardly suspect their status. 
MATT (V.O.) Not only am I the sole but I'm a commercial real estate and transactional attorney, so the most involved of my cousins have been meeting with me regularly to analyze the bids -- Cousin Dave, Cousin Hal, Cousin Six, Cousin Wink, Cousin Lisa, Cousin Connie and Cousin Stan, both of whom oppose the sale entirely. Don't be fooled by appearances. In Hawai'i some of the most powerful people look like bums and stuntmen. 
LATER -- 
Matt and his cousins stand above the conference table, looking at blueprints and architectural drawings. 
MATT (V.O.) (CONT'D) The proposals are virtually the same -- hotels, shopping centers, condos and golf courses. 3000 new jobs in the first five years. Support letters from the construction industry and unions.

(CONT'D) A Chicago group is offering half a billion dollars, but we're leaning toward a lower bid from a guy named Don Holitzer. He's actually from Kaua'i and made a fortune in Silicon Valley. Cousin Hugh is pushing us in that direction, and I say why not? 
CLOSE ON MATT, nodding along but highly distracted, the sound of Liz's VENTILATOR growing louder in his brain. 
We CUT TO ARTIST'S RENDERINGS of comatose Elizabeth -- wide, closer, closer still, closer. 
27   EXT. QUEENS'S HOSPITAL - DAY                                          27 
Establishing.       Matt walks inside the front door. 
28   INT. FAMILY CONSULTATION ROOM - DAY                                   28 
Matt sits across from old family friend DR. SAM JOHNSTON. 
DR. JOHNSTON Bad news, Matt. Dr. Chun, Dr. Mueller and I -- we believe her condition,                            * which we call a multi-factorial anoxic                        * encephalopathy, is deteriorating. We                          * see no eye movement, no pupillary                             * response, basically no brainstem                              * reflexes whatsoever. The machines                             * could keep her going, but her quality                         * of life would be... very poor.                                * Basically what you see now. She'll never be like she was, Matt. Never.                           * We know that now. 
Matt sits very still. 
DR. JOHNSTON (CONT'D) I can't tell you how sorry I am to have to tell you this. And you have your daughters. There's just nothing we can do. 
MATT So... if we do go ahead and take her off the machines -- 
DR. JOHNSTON Not if, Matt. When. I have a legal obligation. You know that.

MATT How long will she last? 
DR. JOHNSTON Hard to say. Could be a few days. Could be two weeks. But for planning purposes, you should work off the shortest possible scenario. I know I need to get the ball rolling on organ donations right away. 
Organ donation?     Forgot about that one. 
DR. JOHNSTON (CONT'D) Elizabeth has so many friends, a big life. Last time I was at your house, must have been 200 people. If you're going to let people know to say goodbye, which is fairly typical protocol in these situations, start now. By the time the last day comes, they feel more ready, as ready as they can feel. I'm so sorry, Matt. 
29   INT. HOSPITAL HALLWAY - DAY                                         29 
His mind spinning, Matt prepares to look at the corpse-to-be. When he opens the door and pulls back the curtain, he finds -- 
30   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                                     30 
-- friends MARK AND KAI MITCHELL up for a visit. They're playing MUSIC for Elizabeth on a mini-boombox, and Kai is APPLYING MAKE-UP to Liz's face. 
After cheery greetings -- 
MATT What're you doing? 
KAI Oh, she's been looking a little pale lately all cooped up in here, and I just know she'd be mortified if no one had thought to help her out with some lipstick and blush. I know she'll grill me. 
Matt and Mark exchange a look -- "Girls." 
MARK And of course Kai's getting her all caught up on all the latest gossip.

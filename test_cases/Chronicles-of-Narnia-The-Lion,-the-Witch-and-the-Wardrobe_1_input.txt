CRICKET 
PETER Peter winds up, goes for the bowl! 
Ball hits Edmund in the leg 
EDMUND Ow! 
PETER Whoops! Wake up, Dolly Daydream! 
EDMUND Can't we play hide and go seek again? 
PETER I thought you said that it was a kid's game. 
SUSAN Besides, we can all use the fresh air. 
EDMUND Not like there's air inside 
PETER Are you ready then? 
EDMUND Are you? (smacks his bat on the ground and gets ready to hit the ball) 
Peter pitches the ball, hard, and Edmund whacks it good and it smashes through an upstairs window and crashes into a suit of armor. 
UPSTAIRS 
The children are looking at the broken window and the suit of armor on the floor 
PETER Well done, Ed! 
EDMUND You bowled it! 
SUSAN Listen, Mrs. Macready is coming 
PETER Run! 
EDMUND (runs to the wardrobe and opens the door) Come on! 
SUSAN You have got to be joking.

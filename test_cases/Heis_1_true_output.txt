PINCUS (AS HE LOOKS OVER HIS SHOULDER AT FRAN AND BELLA, SOTTO) ...seems to be coming along nicely. 
BLANE (SOTTO) My boy there, like to Fertilize the Flowers. 
PINCUS ...how's your leg? 
BLANE You should see the other guy... 
PINCUS (TO MOORE) ...when we do the switch, the Highway... 
MOORE SHAKES HIS HEAD, INDICATING BELLA. 
PINCUS (cont'd) ...he can't hear... 
MOORE ...he can't hear what you don't say... 
PINCUS I'm gonna be as quier as an ant pissing on cotton. 
MOORE FIRES UP THE TORCH, AND BEGINS CUTTING AGAIN. 
ANGLE, IN THE B.G. FRAN AND BELLA. 
BLANE WALKS PINCUS AWAY FROM MOORE. 
BLANE (SOTTO) Don't think it, Baby. Don't think it: Don't be as quiet as an ant pissing on cotton, don't be quiet as an ant thinking about pissing on cotton. You be quiet as an ant not even thinking about pissing on cotton. 
THEIR WALK TAKES THEM TO BELLA AND FRAN.    FRAN IS LAUGHING. 
FRAN ...our friend was telling me "What Made Him a Criminal..." 
BLANE I'll get the beer and pretzels. 
BELLA ...what made you a criminal? 
BLANE Nobody made me a criminal.     I am a Criminal. 
MOORE WALKS OVER. 
MOORE How we doing? 
HE GATHERS THEM AROUND A TABLE. 
BLANE How you doing? 
MOORE I'm done. (PAUSE) Well, that's it them. 
MOORE GETS UP, CAMERA TAKES HIM TO THE RYDER TRUCK. HE OPENS THE BACK, AND WE SEE HIM OPEN WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE SOLID MOTOR, WHICH IS REVEALED TO BE HINGED AND HOLLOW. 
BLANE FOLLOWS HIM, AND HANDS HIM SEVERAL FIREARMS, WHICH HE SECRETS IN THE HOLLOW SPACE. 
MOORE (cont'd) You got the detonators? 
BELLA HOLDS UP SEVERAL PUTTY COLORED PACKAGES OF PLASTIQUE, WHICH HE TAKES OFF OF THE TABLE, BEARING THE PROPS. 
BELLA ...din we check'em? 
MOORE I know we checked'em. What I'm doing, I'm. I'm asking you a question. 
BELLA What happened to Check It an Forget it? 
MOORE Yeah, well, I went to the Other camp, which is Fuss it to Death, and Fuck it into a Cocked Hat, or do you want to run the show...? 
PAUSE.   THEY EXCHANGE A LOOK. 
BELLA WALKS AWAY SHAKING HIS HEAD. 
BLANE Then we ready to Go Do it? 
PINCUS I'm ready to go do it, you know why? I never liked the Swiss in any case. You know why? They make those little clocks, two cocksuckers come out of them, little hammers, hit each other on the head. (PAUSE) What kind of sick mentality is that? 
ANGLE, ON BLANE AND BELLA, AS BELLA LOOKS OVER AT MOORE. 
ANGLE.   ON BELLA, AS HE WALKS OVER TO FRAN. 
THEY BOTH LOOK BACK AT MOORE, WHO IS LOADING UP THE TRUCK. 
BELLA Z'he gonna hold up? 
FRAN Why would you put a man in a position, he's got no way out? 
BELLA What is that, your philosophy? 
FRAN That's right. 
BELLA ...what is it to you? 
FRAN ...he's my Husband. 
BELLA Whose fault is that, you wanna think about it? Listen:... 
MOORE (IN THE B.G.) I... 
ANGLE, ON BELLA, AS HE TURNS. 
BELLA ...you gonna make an Impassioned Speech? 
MOORE Yeah:    Let's go get the money. 
BLANE (TO BELLA AND PINCUS) You clean the place down, n'y'thing'll burn, burn it..., nobody's coming back here, nothing that we need, don't leave it f'somebody else. 
PINCUS LIGHTS A FIRE IN A 55 GALLON DRUM. 
ANGLE, ON MOORE, AS HE WALKS TO THE FRONT OF THE SHED, AND LOOKS OUT AT HIS BOAT. 
FRAN COMES UP BEHIND HIM. 
FRAN Z'it gonna work? 
MOORE It's either gonna be a monumental heist, or a real amusing anecdote. (PAUSE) 
FRAN ...I love you, Joe... 
MOORE Why?

65 CONTINUED: 65 the lawn just beyond the piazza. Mistress Ford is present as well. As the slaves listen, Ford reads to them Scripture. His tone is of a man trying to preach by way of compassion. 
FORD "But as touching the resurrection of the dead, have ye not read that which was spoken unto you by God, saying, I am the God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob. God is not the God of the dead, but of the living. And when the multitude heard this, they were astonished at his doctrine. Then one of them, which was a lawyer, asked him a question, tempting him, and saying, Master, which is the great commandment in the law? Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself. On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets." Despite the lightness with which Ford speaks and the hope in his words, ELIZA SITS OFF TO THE SIDE - SELF-SECLUDED 
A BIT - WEEPING GENTLY. We should be able to see in Mistress Ford's eyes that Eliza's constant crying is unsettling.

70 EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY 70 
-MID JUNE, 1841- The slaves have broken for lunch. They snack on smoked meat and drink water from gourds. As they lunch Solomon reads from Sam's Bible to the other slaves. 
SOLOMON But he that is greatest among you, let him be as the younger; and he that is chief, as he that doth serve. For whether is greater, he that sitteth at meat, or he that serveth? Is not he that sitteth at meat? But I am among you as he that serveth. A white customer - WINSLOW - irate at the sight and sound of slaves reading Scripture, crosses over. He grabs the Bible. 
WINSLOW From where did you thieve this? 
SAM Suh, the book is my property. The White Customer has no interest in Sam's answer. With flailing hands he STARTS BEATING ON SAM. Solomon tries to stop him. That only makes the situation worse, Solomon now the target of the man's ire. 
WINSLOW Take your hands from me! Ford comes running over. 
FORD What is the commotion? 
WINSLOW Your niggers are either brazen or rebellious. This one was readin' Scripture, and this one claims it to be his. 
FORD It is. A gift from his Mistress. 
WINSLOW You condone this? 
FORD I encourage it. As a Christian I can do no less. 
(CONTINUED) 
70 CONTINUED: 70 
WINSLOW You can do no worse, Ford. A slave that reads is dangerous. Winslow moves off. He yells back at Ford: 
WINSLOW (CONT'D) And the man who would allow a slave to read is unfit to own niggers! Handing the Bible back to Sam, very matter of factly: 
FORD Pay him no mind. The word of God applies to all. In that you may take comfort.

72 EXT. ROAD - DAY 72 
Sam is at the reigns of the wagon carrying the timber to Ford's WORK AREA. Slaves trudge alongside, same as it ever was. Only...it's not quite the same. Sam brings the wagon to a halt. He, and the slaves look up the road ahead of them. Standing in the middle of the road is a group of CHICKASAWS INDIANS. They are in their "usual" dress of buckskin breeches and calico hunting shirts of fantastic colors, buttoned from belt to chin. They have with them DOGS and HORSES. They carry with them the carcass of a deer. The two groups stare at each other for a long moment. 
EXT. FIELD - DUSK/END OF DAY 
The groups of slaves and Chickasaws are now intermingled. They "break bread" - actually they work on the carcass of the deer which is now roasting over a large fire. As well the group share a smoke on a pipe. One of the Chickasaws is playing a tune on an "INDIAN FIDDLE." The Chickasaws perform a customary dance; trotting after each other, and giving utterance to a guttural, sing-song noise. The slaves enjoy the respite from work, Solomon particularly taken by the music...if not entirely enthralled by it. 
(CONTINUED) 
73 CONTINUED: 73 After a bit, Solomon rights himself and heads from the group. 
74 EXT. RIVER BANK - CONTINUOUS 74 
Solomon arrives to some tall grass at the edge of the river. Lowering his trousers, SOLOMON SQUATS TO DEFECATE. As he does, he stares out toward the flowing waters of Indian Creek. After a few moments, as though a thought far greater than relieving himself has come to him, Solomon stands and replaces his pants. Oddly, Solomon stares out at the water as though he were a man possessed. 
EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - DAY 
Just beyond the WORK AREA Solomon speaks with Ford as Tibeats listens. Solomon is drawing in the dirt, making rough diagrams for Ford as he explains himself. 
SOLOMON The creek is plenty deep enough to sail, even with a boat full of load. The distance from the WORK AREA to the point on the latter bayou is several miles by water fewer than land. It occurs to me that the expense of the transportation would be materially 
DIMINISHED-- 
TIBEATS "Materially diminished?" 
SOLOMON If we use the waterway.

DOCTOR 
looks at the clock and reprots to an attending nurse. Another nurse cleans up the baby, wieghs him and places him in a hospital bassinet. 
DOCTOR 13th of May... 4:25 p.m. 
CLEAR, KEN AND BARBARA 
Barabra places a cool wet cloth on Clear's forehead... 
BARBARA Exactly a year... to the minute. 
Everyone recognizes the eerie, yet beautiful coincidence. Clear leans her haed back, relieved, euphoric... 
CLEAR We beat it, Alex. 
Cleaned and wrapped in a swaddling blanket, the baby is placed in the mothers arms. The long retrospective harmonica of Neil Young's "Long May You Run" reprises as Clear looks at the I.D. braclet... 
WRIST BRACLET 
"Alexander Chance Browning II." 
DELIVERY ROOM 
CAMERA PULLS BACK. The birthing room is quiet; the people introspective. The doctors. The family. The mother and child. A room of new life, in which, each recalls a life lost. 
As "Long May You Run" OVERLAPS... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - DAY - FLOWERS 
A bright, colorful arrangment of flowers is carefully placed into a vase. CAMERA ADJUSTS to REVEAL Alex's bedroom is now lived in by Clear and the baby. Clear makes the final adjustment in the arrangement, then checks the sleeping baby in the bassinet. 
Clear moves to her bed with a book. As she settles in, O.S., a faint RUSTLE. CAMERA INCHES IN ON CLEAR as she looks to... 
CLEAR'S POV - THE FLOWERS 
a soft breeze causes the petals to flutter... 
CLEAR 
looks toward... 
CLEAR'S POV - THE WINDOWS 
which are closed. 
CLEAR'S POV - THE FAN 
which... is off. 
CLEAR 
looks across the room... 
CLEAR'S POV - THE ROOM 
The breeze moves through the flowers... billows the cutains, posters and photos on the wall... until seemingly settling over the bassinet. The lace trim and blankets rustled by the breeze, it is hovering over the child. 
CLEAR 
CAMERA SETTLES, but her expression does not reflect fear. She knows Alex is here... and she smiles, tears welling in her eyes. 
THE BABY 
the bassinet trim settles, as if the presence is leaving. Before it fully departs... 
CLEAR 
the wind softly and rapidly passes over Clear. He smile remains as the room becomes still and her eyes looks across the room. 
CLEAR'S POV - ON THE WALL 
is a pencil rubbing, like people take away from the Vietnam veteran's Memorial. The name... "ALEX BROWNING..." 
CUT TO: 
EXT. MT. ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - CLOSE - MONUMENT 
"ALEX BROWNING" is marked in the granite. CAMERA PULLS BACK TO REVEAL the name has been added to the memorial, along with Tod Waggner, Valerie Lewton, Terry Chaney and William Hitchcock. 
A hand ENTERS FRAME, fingers hover in space before they gently trace over "Terry Chaney." CAMERA ADJUSTS TO REVEAL Carter Horton, staring at the name. Alone, he allows himself the moment to grieve. Carter glances up to find Clear approaching with the baby in the stroller. 
Carter straightens and nods, then begins to walk away. He hesitates, then turns back to Clear. 
CARTER Alex was right. 
Clear looks up. 
CARTER (CONT'D) It did skip us. 
Clear smiles. As she takes the baby out of the stroller...

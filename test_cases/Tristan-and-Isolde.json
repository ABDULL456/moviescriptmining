{"train": "TRISTAN + ISOLDE \nWritten by \nDean Georgaris \nTranscript by \nChani at tristanandisolde net \nBritain the Dark Ages \nThe Roman Empire has fallen. \nThe land lies in ruins, divided amoung feuding tribes. \nTo the west, Ireland has flourished untouched by the Romans, protected by the sea. \nLed by their powerful and ruthless King, the Irish have subdued the Britons. \nKnowing that if Ireland is to prosper, the tribes must never be allowed to unite. \n[Scene showing images of mountains. A young boy Tristan hunts with his father for a rabbit] \nARAGON A year younger than I was for my first. \nTRISTAN When can I have a stag? \nARAGON a stag? \nTRISTAN Oh come on! \n[The two walk home through the mountains. Main title appears] TRISTAN + ISOLDE \nTRISTAN Why would they join up against the Irish? \nLADY MARKE We heard the news... \nTRISTAN Mother, I made this for you \n[Lady Marke smiles and touches Tristan\u0092s face lovingly] \n[In the Main Hall of Aragon, the assembled tribe Lords gather in meet] \nARAGON Friends, look at us. \n[A map of Britain is shown] \nARAGON The tribes of Britain. Divided. Weak. Just as the Irish like us. But if we were one land united, we would out number them two to one. We could defeat them once and for all. That is why we are here today, to sign this treaty of unification. \nLORD But who would be King? \nARAGON The strongest among us: Lord Marke. \n[Scene of movement outside of the town] \nARAGON Look if you are happy sending all of your gold to Ireland, living as slaves then by all means do nothing. \nBARON If we were happy doing that then we would never have risked coming here. \nMARKE Friends. My wife is with child, my heart tells me it is a boy. I want him to grow old in a land where all of us, all the tribes: Pict, Celt, Angle, Jute, Saxon are at peace. This island has not known unity since the Romans left. That is why I sign this treaty. \nWICTRED And why should we follow you? \nMARKE Perhaps, Wictred, because your last attempt to form an alliance without the knowledge of half the Barons in this room has failed. \n[A man bursts into the room] \nMAN My Lord! The Irish are here! \n[Scenes of destruction outside the keep. Inside Aragon grabs Marke] \n[Isolde and Bragnae approach a cairn where Isolde lays an urn of her mother\u0092s ashes within a niche] \nBRAGNAE Your mother loved you so much Isolde \nISOLDE Why did she die Bragnae? Why? \nBRAGNAE It was an ill fever that took her. Fever. \nISOLDE No. It was her heart. \n[\u0093Castle Dor\u0094 appears onscreen. A procession of survivors from Marke\u0092s retinue return home. They find Dor in ruins. Marke\u0092s sister runs up to him and cries in his arms] \nMARKE Your husband? \n[Edyth shakes her head] \nMARKE Oh sister I am so sorry. \nEDYTH: THE EXECUTIONS LASTED A DAY. * \nMARKE A whole generation of men. \nEDYTH Who\u0092s this? \nMARKE Tristan. Son of Aragon. We\u0092re his family now. \nEDYTH I have a son about your age. Melot! Melot!  Melot, this is Tristan. \nHENCHMAN What shall we do, my Lord? \nMARKE Rebuild. \n[Rebuilding is taking place. The youth are practicing their swordsmanship. Marke is testing his ability with his sword without his hand] \nMARKE Don\u0092t hold back \n[They re-emerge from the tunnel] \nMELOT Here we are: the bottom of the keep. \nTRISTAN Who else knows about this? \nSAMMY Nobody. \nTRISTAN Good. \n[They exit the keep] \nBODKIN The savages have rebuilt the castle at Cornwall, only now it\u0092s made of stone. \nKING DONNCHADH Of Cornwall\u0092s next tribute I want slaves. Young ones. Their future. If Marke resists have Morholt crush him. \nMORHOLT My King. \nKING DONNCHADH Morholt. \nMORHOLT I have led your armies to victory far and near. I\u0092v made you rich and powerful. \nKING DONNCHADH Yes you have. You have been most loyal. \nMORHOLT When I return from Cornwall, I was hoping... \nKING DONNCHADH What would please you? \nMORHOLT A wife. \n[The cairn appears once again, with a grown up Isolde leaning on it looking out to sea] \nBRAGNAE It\u0092s dark in an hour. \nISOLDE What do you think is really out there? \nMORHOLT And you know the antidote for this? \nISOLDE Yohimbine. \nMORHOLT Makes a hard man even harder.  The only cure... wild abandon. Till out wedding day. I\u0092m to Cornwall, to deal with rabbles. \n[The Irish arrive in Cornwall and enter the town of Castle Dor] \nBODKIN Release them. \n[The Irish men spread out and start collecting Cornish men and women as hostages] \nCORNISH MAN Leave her! \n[He is grabbed by the Irish thugs] \nBODKIN Take him there. Get a rope. Any man foolish enough to interfere in any way shall suffer the same fate. \n[A girl rushes forward] \nGIRL No! No! Please No! \n[The man is hung and Tristan rushes forward. He is held back by the Irish men. The Cornish hostages are put in a wagon] \nBODKIN If there are any more attacks we shall put our guests to death and raise this entire land. Take the horses. \n[Tristan confronts Marke about the Irish] \nMARKE When would you strike? \nTRISTAN At once. Throw everything we have at them. \nMARKE They are hoping you'll do that. On horse they outnumber us two to one. You would lead the men straight to their deaths. \nTRISTAN So we do nothing?! \nTRISTAN Simon! \nSAMMY I don\u0092t want to die. \n[Simon dies and Tristan collapses] \nMAN Tristan! \nTRISTAN I can\u0092t feel my legs or my hands. \nMAN Poison. \nTRISTAN Build a second boat. \nMAN Tristan! \n[Tristan seems to die] \nMELOT He shall have a King's service. \n[Tristan is lain on a funeral boat and floated out to sea] \nMELOT Farewell, Tristan of Aragon. Death of the Irish. \n[The boat is set alight by burning arrows. Melot turns to the captured Irish] \nMELOT When the Irish came to Cornwall and my father surrendered. You spared a dozen out of a hundred. I am even less kind. The leader and 3 shall take this message home. As for the rest... \n[The surviving British and the hostages return to Dor. Marke meets them] \nMELOT Victory. \nMARKE Tristan? \nMELOT Simon too. \n[They drag Tristan to a hut on the beachfront] \nISOLDE Start a fire! Quickly! \n[Isolde checks his condition while Bragnae tries to light the fire] \nISOLDE His heart falters. \n[Isolde starts to undress] \nBRAGNAE What are you doing? \nISOLDE He needs heat. Now! Get your clothes off! Quickly! \n[Isolde curls up against Tristan while Bragnae starts to undress] \nISOLDE Hurry! Quickly! Smell that? Smell the poison? When he warms we will need thistle and bark. \nBRAGNAE I\u0092ve not been naked with a man for 15 years! \nISOLDE Hello.  You've been sleeping a long time. You're in Ireland. Did you know that? Shh... It's alright. You're safe here. No one knows. Don't be scared. Just sleep... sleep. \n[Tristan fades out of consciousness] \n[Tristan wakes and grabs a stone to use as a weapon when he hears a noise] \nBRAGNAE Nooo Nooo Noo! \n[Isolde runs in] \nISOLDE It\u0092s alright, you don\u0092t need that! I forgot to tell him about you... \nBRAGNAE I\u0092ll wait outside with the other beasts. \n[Bragnae leaves] \nISOLDE Any word of my betrothed? \nKING DONNCHADH Overdue. But comforted no doubt that you yearn for him. \n[The King leaves] \n[Isolde leaves the town to return to the hut on the beach. She sees Tristan bathing in the sea. Isolde tends to Tristan\u0092s wounds back in the hut] \nTRISTAN What's your name? \nISOLDE Oh, I think it's better if we don't bother with names. \nTRISTAN How can I thank you if I don't have your name? \nISOLDE You just did. If you insist... my name is Bragnae. I'm a lady in waiting at the court. My parents are dead. My mother, she is the source of the kindness you find so puzzling. My father would've left you where you fell. \nTRISTAN Tristan of Aragon. \nISOLDE Well Tristan of Aragon, I'd guess about you too, but I think I've already seen everything. \nBRAGNAE Sir! I hope you appreciate the risks we are taking, and will honour us by leaving as soon as you are able. \n[Bragnae leaves] \nTRISTAN She likes me. She\u0092s right though, you do risk. \n[Finishes poulticing him] \nISOLDE There. What of your parents? \nTRISTAN They also died when I was a child. \nISOLDE Of what? \nTRISTAN A different type of Irish kindness. \n[Bragnae and Isolde leave] \n[Tristan and Isolde look out to sea] \nTRISTAN You\u0092re promised? \nISOLDE Yes. \nTRISTAN What\u0092s he like? \nISOLDE Dark. Tall. Nearly twice your size. An absolute gentleman. \nTRISTAN I thought... earlier when you spoke of wanting something you can\u0092t have. \nISOLDE I didn\u0092t know what I was talking about. \n[They leave the shore and go inside the hut, Isolde is crying] \nISOLDE Outside, just past that bluff there is a boat. That\u0092s how you should go when you leave. You should go soon. \n[Isolde leaves but Tristan goes after her. They kiss. Inside the hut they make love.] \nTRISTAN How do you feel? \nISOLDE I don\u0092t know \nISOLDE Tristan! They\u0092ve found your boat. At this very moment the King himself is scouring the coast. He will find you. He finds everyone. The tide is coming let\u0092s go! \n[They drag the boat out to see] \nTRISTAN Come with me. Come with me! \nISOLDE I can\u0092t \nTRISTAN Why not? Please! \nWICTRED As baron of Wessex it is my duty to fight in this tournament for my people. \nMARKE For yourself you mean. \nMELOT And what of the support you promised Tristan? \nWICTRED Tristan is dead. My people have suffered enough. They see the wealth of Lyonesse as more real than any alliance. My mind is set. \nBARON And ours as well. \nMARKE So be it. \n[Tristan rides back into town] \nMELOT You're weary, let me rally your friends. I\u0092ll lead them against D... \nMARKE Ah, Melot, Melot, Melot. You are my blood and you are a noble presence but...... \n[They hear the sounds of the townspeople calling welcome to Tristan outside. Everyone rushes to Tristan] \nGUARD Lord Marke! He\u0092s back! It\u0092s Tristan! \nMAN It cannot be! \nEDYTH Tristan! \nMELOT I saw you dead. \nTRISTAN I am delivered. \nMARKE How? How? \n[There is a celebration for Tristan\u0092s return that night] \nMARKE A toast! Tristan! Back from the dead. \nTRISTAN Let me go and win you a wife. She can make peace without spilling one drop of blood, and maybe heal a wound from which you still lack. \n[The British arrive in Ireland. A henchman approaches Tristan] \nBODKIN Truce. You have safe passage. \n[The warriors enter the tournament arena] \nTRISTAN How do I look? \nHENCHMAN How do you look? \nMELOT Where is this Princess? What\u0092s her name? Isolde? I want to see what she looks like. \n[Maids attend to Isolde as the King enters] \nBRAGNAE There. Almost done. \nISOLDE No, not quite. If I am to be a present I should be fully wrapped. \n[The King takes his seat on the podium overlooking the arena] \nKING DONNCHADH See how the bees come to the honey. \nTRISTAN Tristan of Aragon. \n[He is given a specially prepared tablet] \nKING DONNCHADH So he lives. \nBODKIN For the moment. \nWICTRED Wictred of Glastonbury. \n[He is also given a prepared stone] \n[Wictred and Tristan work through their opponents until they face each other] \nWICTRED Mace. \nMELOT One more fight Tristan. Take deep breaths. \nHERALD Wictred: Lord of Saxonberg. Tristan: Champion of Cornwall. Warriors: Begin! \n[Tristan and Wictred fight. Wictred is booed by the crowd. Tristan defeats Wictred.] \nTRISTAN Yield! \n[Tristan goes before the King] \nKING DONNCHADH An impressive victory. Of course the man who defeats Morholt might be expected to triumph here. \nTRISTAN On behalf of Cornwall, I offer your daughter a place on our throne. The throne of England, united behind one leader. \nKING DONNCHADH Isolde! Perhaps it is just that he who took a husband provides one. \n[Isolde comes forward] \nISOLDE I\u0092m yours. \nKING DONNCHADH No. Tristan of Aragon has won you on behalf of Lord Marke of Cornwall. \nMELOT Let\u0092s go. \n[Everyone disperses] \nKING DONNCHADH Let them take her across the sea. After the wedding I'll disavow Isolde, the alliance will crumble. \n[The English sail back to Britain with Isolde and Bragnae] \nHENCHMAN Tristan. Princess wants to speak to you. \nISOLDE My Lord. \nMARKE Isolde? Welcome. \n[He takes her hand and everyone claps] \n[Isolde\u0092s wedding gown is prepared. Marke puts on his metal hand for the ceremony. Isolde \u0096 fully dressed- floats down the river to the wedding ceremony about a decorated ship. She and Marke go forward to be wed. There is a celebration after the wedding. As Isolde and Marke leave the party, Isolde approaches Tristan] \nISOLDE If things were different. If we lived in a place without duty... would you be with me? \nTRISTAN That place does not exist. \nISOLDE I'll pretend it's you. \n[Isolde and Marke retire to their bedroom. Tristan watches their window from outside] \nMARKE You\u0092re trembling. You are far from home and I am a stranger still. But you mustn\u0092t fear me. My wish is to make you happy, as a wife.. as a women and hopefully one day, the fact that I am not whole will not offend you. \n[Marke kisses Isolde and makes love to her] \n[Marke and Isolde stand outside the keep surveying the town. Mark fingers her shell bracelet] \nMARKE That\u0092s pretty. Did you make it? \nISOLDE It was a present. \n[Tristan goes to Edyths home and knocks on the door] \nMAN Tristan? \nTRISTAN Might I stay here a while? \nMAN Of course. \n[There is a montage of Tristan and Isolde\u0092s lives while in Dor. Finally in the marketplace Isolde is fed food by Mark and they laugh together. Edyth sees Tristan watching] \n[Melot is very upset] \nMARKE For the first time since the Romans, this country stands united. \n[After leaving the signing, Tristan chases down Marke] \nTRISTAN I can\u0092t be your second. Melot must be. He is blood. Besides, I wish to journey north. \nMARKE You no longer sleep at Dor, and now you don\u0092t want to be my second. Do you find no comfort in your home? These stone walls that you helped build? \nTRISTAN I find these walls a prison. \nMARKE Why? \nTRISTAN Everything I want seems misplaced. \nMARKE Ever since you were a boy you sacrificed everything for me. All for one dream. Now that you reached that dream, it is natural that you would feel some loss. It doesn\u0092t matter if you want to be second. You are. I will only be king if you are my second. I\u0092d put it more gently if I could. \nTRISTAN Then I am your second. \nMARKE Perhaps it is time that you took a wife! \nTRISTAN No! \nMARKE Can\u0092t live alone forever. \nTRISTAN I can! \n[Isolde passes] \nMARKE Isolde. I was trying to explain to Tristan the importance of loving. It seems he might live without it. \nISOLDE Why? \nTRISTAN There are other things to live for. Duty. Honour. \nMARKE Of course. \n[Isolde leaves] \nWICTRED Friends, friends hear me! We\u0092ve forgotten the full moon isn\u0092t it time to ride out? \nGENERAL No. Tonight it cause for exception. \nWICTRED But the coronation should uphold tradition, surely it is not to be neglected already? \nMARKE We honour it. In half a night. Ride out! Where\u0092s Tristan? \n[Everyone leaves to hunt while Tristan and Isolde race to be with each other] \nISOLDE I miss Ireland \nTRISTAN Isolde, this must end. \nISOLDE That\u0092s like asking me to stop breathing. \nTRISTAN It cannot be. \n[Elsewhere Wictred leads the hunt to where Tristan and Isolde are] \nISOLDE Please don\u0092t leave me. Please! \n[They kiss only to have the hunting party come upon them] \nMARKE Isolde? There is someone...  No. \nKING DONNCHADH I see how it is in Cornwall. My money is good enough, my alliance is good enough, but my daughter you pass amoung your lieutenants like a whore! \nISOLDE It\u0092s not like that. \nKING DONNCHADH I see no relation to me here! I will see this peace end. \n[At the tunnel entrance] \nMELOT It comes up to the Roman foundations at the lowest level. \nWICTRED This is a godsend! \n[They both enter it and Wictred gestures for his men to follow] \n[There is much fighting as the forces of the Irish and traitorous barons besiege Castle Dor. In the tunnel, Wictred and Melot move towards the keep] \nWICTRED What will you say to him? \nMELOT That he will not make any more mistakes and that it is time for him to move ba \u0096 what\u0092s that?! \n[The two turn to see Wictred\u0092s men following them down the tunnel. Melot fights to stop them going down the tunnel but is stabbed] \n[The enemy forces break through the outer gates and are attempting to get into the keep] \nMAN Aim for the front of the line \nMARKE They are waiting. \n[As Wictred and his men enter the keep from the tunnel below, Tristan enters the tunnel from the forest entrance] \nMAN The Irish are inside! \nMARKE Follow me! \nWICTRED Bar the door make sure no one gets in! \n[In the tunnel, Tristan comes upon a wounded Melot] \nMELOT You. \nTRISTAN What happened here? \nMARKE Give me your shield, we\u0092re pinned down! \n[Tristan attacks Wictred and his men] \nMARKE Tristan! \nMARKE\u0092S MAN Him too? \nMARKE No, he\u0092s with us! \n[Marke and his men jump into battle, but not before Tristan is stabbed. Tristan manages to stop the drawbridge falling with his sword. He is again stabbed by Wictred] \nMARKE Tristan! \n[Tristan stabs Wictred and kills him. Tristan pulls the sword from his body as the battle subsides] \nMARKE Tristan! How did you get here? \nTRISTAN Secret. Secrets, in the bowls of the keep. \nMARKE In the bowls of the keep. \nMAN They have reached the palisades. \nGENERAL Then we must keep hope. \n[Tristan cuts the head off Wictred\u0092s body and slowly stands. Marke nods] \n[As the drawbridge of the keep is lowered, King Donnchadh makes his way to the front] \nKING DONNCHADH Get back! Ha ha ha! Ha ha ha! \n[Tristan slowly steps out with the head of Wictred in his hands] \nTRISTAN Behold! The head of a traitor! \n", "test1_input": "MELOT Yes well, peace can be just as treacherous as war and I feel that Marke doesn\u0092t really...Listen to me!!! Our attention must be on Cornwall now more than ever. \nTRISTAN I am sorry he didn\u0092t choose you. I am. \n[Melot approaches Marke] \nMELOT Can I speak to you? \n[Marke leaves Isolde\u0092s side, Tristan leaves and Isolde follows. They hide in a room were they begin to kiss each other passionately. Finishing his conversation with Melot, Marke seeks Isolde. Later that night, Marke makes love to Isolde] \n[Tristan and Isolde are out in a forest clearing together. It is an old ruins, with paintings of a couple on the broken walls] \nISOLDE What do you think became of them? \nTRISTAN They were lives... just lived. \nISOLDE I find myself imaging things in this place. I decorate it. Books, a harp there... a child. \nTRISTAN Would it be his or mine? \nISOLDE I would have no way to tell, would I? He is a kind man Tristan, I cannot hate him. Yesterday at the market I saw a couple holding hands, and I realised we would never do that. Never anything like it. No picnics or unguarded smiles. No rings. Just stolen moments that leave too quickly. \n[In the marketplace Isolde and Marke shop. Tristan steals some herbs and makes a wreath for Isolde. He surreptitiously slips it onto Isolde\u0092s wrist as Merlot and Wictred look on] \n[Later, Marke goes to his bedroom but finds Bragnae waiting] \nMARKE Where is Isolde? \nBRAGNAE I don\u0092t know for sure, she was having a walk in the garden before and I\u0092m afraid I got tired so I returned. It\u0092s my fault. \n[Bragnae goes to find Tristan and Isolde who are meeting in secret] \nBRAGNAE You\u0092re going to get caught! Both of you! He\u0092s looking for you right now, he\u0092ll see you! I told you this would happen! \nTRISTAN There is another door here, forgotten. This comes up in the bottom chamber of the keep. \n", "test1_true": "TRISTAN Hurry! Go on. \n[Isolde and Bragnae go down] \nBRAGNAE I\u0092m tired of this. I\u0092m tired of lying for you. I\u0092m sick of it. \nISOLDE Then don\u0092t. \n[Isolde goes to bed with Marke] \nISOLDE There is a servings child, quite ill. Doing better now. \nMARKE I didn\u0092t ask you were you were. Your heart is beating so fast. \nISOLDE Is it? \nMARKE Isolde. Is there anything I can do to make you happier. I want to make you happy. \nISOLDE I\u0092m fine. \n[Wictred speaks to King Donnchadh in secret] \nWICTRED She\u0092s in love with Tristan. They\u0092re intimates. If I expose them it will break Marke\u0092s heart and his hold on the other Barons. \nKING DONNCHADH How? \nWICTRED With Marke\u0092s champion in chains, we\u0092ll take Castle Dor. You can man your armies unopposed. There will be no one defending you in the waters. \nKING DONNCHADH And your price? \nWICTRED I want Marke\u0092s throne. \n[As the King leaves he talks to Bodkin] \n", "test1_id": 1515, "test2_input": "KING DONNCHADH When his throne falls apart, we\u0092ll go over and pick up the pieces. \n[Marke approaches Tristan as he looks over the town] \nMARKE Tristan? Can I speak with you? Is it possible... do you think a man blinded by love... Is it possible that that man might not see treachery right in front of him? \n[Takes out wreath] \nI found this hidden amoung Isolde's things. Do you think she has a lover? Has she said anything to you? \nTRISTAN No. \nMARKE Perhaps you could follow her. I can\u0092t ask anyone else. I know. I know what you think \u0096 I\u0092m acting like a child. Normally I can read faces, but with hers I feel like... I can't be objective. She\u0092s so delicate. \nTRISTAN You really love her. \nMARKE Oh... I do...terribly. I didn\u0092t know how empty I was. She sustains me, she thrills me. And when I see this ring, it is a ring of thorns. \nTRISTAN The ring is nothing. She's loyal to you. I am sure of it. \nMARKE ... If you say so. \n[Tristan is tortured by Marke\u0092s proclamation and burns his and Isolde\u0092s meeting place. Isolde finds it in ruins. The Irish arrive on ships for the coronation ceremony] \nMAN I count nine \nTRISTAN If they move they will warn us with a black flag \n[The King of Ireland arrives and shakes hands with a waiting Marke] \nMARKE You bring an entourage? \nKING DONNCHADH I can let myself be alone in my position Lord Marke. But don\u0092t worry, they will stay offshore.  I miss you. \nMARKE My nephew, Merlot of Cornwall \n", "test2_true": "MARKE Indeed. \n[Inside the castle the coronation is held in Latin. Marke and Isolde are crowned and take their seats on their thrones. Back at the lookout point the flag bearers are stabbed by the Irish. Dancing happens at the coronation celebrations] \nMARKE Tristan! Seems I worried for nothing. \nWICTRED May I dance with the Queen, or does Tristan have the next one? \nMARKE That\u0092s right, you have never danced with Isolde before! \n[Tristan is pushed forward to dance with Isolde] \nWICTRED A new song for Tristan. Slow. \nISOLDE Why did you burn it? \nTRISTAN You know. \nISOLDE Meet me there in an hour or I\u0092ll die. \n[The dance ends] \nMARKE I could still teach you a thing or two, dancing being one of them. \nKAYE Accuse him now. \nWICTRED No, no, no. We\u0092ll have more than accusations. \n[Tristan leaves] \nMARKE Is something the matter? \nISOLDE I\u0092m just feeling a little weary that\u0092s all. I might just go and have a lie down. \n", "test2_id": 1516, "test3_input": "MELOT I like this plan. \n[Tristan is in chains in the keep. Marke comes down to see him] \nMARKE I came to apologise. I\u0092ve been selfish arrogantly thinking that perhaps I\u0092d given enough. At least enough to merit if not your love then at least your respect. You have a home. A kingdom. Why was it not enough? Tell me.  Tell me! You do not know what you have done! Everything is destroyed, everything! All because you did not have enough. She\u0092s loyal to you I am sure of it. You bloodsucker. What could it had been had I not stretched out my hand to save your life. How I curse that day, how I curse it. And so be with your defence. Then I will go complete your punishment, Donnchadh marches on us as we speak. \n[Marke strides away. Bragnae catches up to him in a corridor. She bars entrance to his bedroom] \nBRAGNAE She\u0092s young. I will not let you harm her! \n[Marke moves Bragnae out of the way and enters the room] \nMARKE How long? \nISOLDE Since you thought he was dead. I found him wounded on the beach in Ireland. I hid him from my father and I told him my name was Bragnae. So when he came to the tournament at Dunluce to win Donnchadh\u0092s daughter he didn\u0092t realise it was me. All this time my heart has been his, and I am sorry. He tried harder than you can possibly imagine because he loves you. \n[Marke leaves the room in silence] \n[Merlot and Wictred walk through the forest discussing plans] \nMELOT I will coax him out, make sure Donnchadh knows this. \nWICTRED Of course, of course. You know as things moved along I suspected them for some time. \nMERLOT Tristan and Isolde? \nWICTRED You know what I could never work out? How it was conducted. How she got in and out of Dor unseen. \nMERLOT The tunnel. \nWICTRED What? \nMERLOT The Roman Tunnel! \nWICTRED Show me. \n", "test3_true": "TRISTAN What is this? \nHENCHMAN The will of the King. Farwell. \nISOLDE I told him about Ireland. He\u0092s given us our freedom. Why does loving you feel so wrong? \nTRISTAN Get in. \nISOLDE Tristan, if I do this. \nTRISTAN For all time, they will say it was our love that brought down a kingdom. Remember us. \n[Tristan pushes the boat away] \nISOLDE Tristan, don\u0092t! Tristan! Tristan! Tristan! Why?! Tristan! \n[Tristan runs back to Dor] \n[At Dor they bring everyone into the castle and close the gates. The armies close in on Dor] \nMARKE Get the livestock and fuel undercover. Put some archers on the ramparts. \nGENERAL All the archers have deserted us as has half the household. \nMARKE And you stay? \nMAN If you are surprised then they have won already. \nGENERAL Come on, hurry! \n[The armies gather outside the keep] \nKING DONNCHADH Burn it.

Too many questions. Here keep it dry. Here I found bread, you have water and fire. The ocean is outside if you wish a bath. You won\u0092t know where you are going so please don\u0092t try to leave.

In half a night. Ride out! Where\u0092s Tristan? \n[Everyone leaves to hunt while Tristan and Isolde race to be with each other] \nISOLDE I miss Ireland \nTRISTAN Isolde, this must end. \nISOLDE That\u0092s like asking me to stop breathing. \nTRISTAN It cannot be. \n[Elsewhere Wictred leads the hunt to where Tristan and Isolde are] \nISOLDE Please don\u0092t leave me.

He\u0092s asked me to give you a message. \nBARON What\u0092s this? \nWICTRED It is compensation for the men you will lose attacking Castle Dor with Donnchadh tomorrow. Let\u0092s be honest, our people need a stronger leader. \nBARON And who might that be, Wictred? \nWICTRED Melot. Too long the ablest amoung us has been denied his rightful place.

At least enough to merit if not your love then at least your respect. You have a home. A kingdom. Why was it not enough? Tell me.  Tell me! You do not know what you have done! Everything is destroyed, everything! All because you did not have enough. She\u0092s loyal to you I am sure of it. You bloodsucker.

All this time my heart has been his, and I am sorry. He tried harder than you can possibly imagine because he loves you. \n[Marke leaves the room in silence] \n[Merlot and Wictred walk through the forest discussing plans] \nMELOT I will coax him out, make sure Donnchadh knows this. \nWICTRED Of course, of course. You know as things moved along I suspected them for some time. \nMERLOT Tristan and Isolde? \nWICTRED You know what I could never work out? How it was conducted.

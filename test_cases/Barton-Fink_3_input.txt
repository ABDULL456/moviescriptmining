BACK TO BARTON 
His neck goes rubbery. His eyes roll up. His head lolls back to hit the wall. 
BLACK 
Slap! Slap! 
We are low on Charlie, who is following through on a slap and backing away, having aroused Barton. Charlie is now wearing pants but is still in his sleeveless tee, which has blood flecks across the belly. 
CHARLIE You passed out. 
Barton looks groggily up. 
BARTON ...Uh-huh... Where's Audrey? 
CHARLIE She's dead, Barton! If that was her name. 
TRACKING IN ON BARTON 
He stares at Charlie. 
CHARLIE (off) Barton, listen to me. You gotta act like nothing's happened. Put this totally out of your head. I know that's hard, but your play from here on out is just to go about business as usual. Give us some time to sort this out... 
Barton looks at his watch. 
THE WATCH 
CHARLIE (off) ...Just put it out of you head... 
TRACKING 
Toward a pool set in a grand yard with shaped hedges and statuary set amid palms trees. 
Sunlight glitters angrily off the water; we are approaching Jack Lipnik who sits poolside in a white deck chair. 
LIPNIK Bart! So happy to see ya! 
REVERSE 
Pulling Barton, who is being escorted by Lou Breeze. 
Barton is haggard, sunken eyes squinting against too much sun. 
LIPNIK Sit! Talk! Relax for a minute, then talk!  Drink? 
As Barton sits: 
BARTON Yeah... rye whiskey? 
LIPNIK Boy! You writers! Work hard, play hard!  That's what I hear, anyway... 
He laughs, then barks at Lou Breeze. 
LIPNIK ... Lou. 
Lou exits. 
LIPNIK Anyway. Ben Geisler tells me things're going along great.  Thinks we've got a real winner in this one. And let me tell you something, I'm counting on it. I've taken an interest. Not to interfere, mind you  hardly seems necessary in your case. A writer  a storyteller  of your stature. Givitta me in bold strokes, Bart. Gimme the broad outlines. I'm sitting in the audience, the lights go down, Capitol logo comes up... you're on! 
He beams expectantly at Barton.  Barton licks his parched lips. 
BARTON Yeah, okay... well... we fade in... 
Lipnik is nodding, already involved in the story. 
BARTON ...It's a tenement building. On the Lower East Side... 
LIPNIK Great! He's poor, this wrestler! He's had to struggle! 
BARTON And then... well... 
Barton looks back out at the pool, his eyes closed to slits against the sun. He looks back at Lipnik. 
BARTON ...Can I be honest, Mr. Lipnik? 
LIPNIK CAN you?  You damn well better be. Jesus, if I hadn't been honest in my business dealings  well, of course, you can't always be honest, not with the sharks swimming around this town  but if you're a writer, you don't think about those things  if I'd been totally honest, I wouldn't be within a mile of this pool  unless I was cleaning it. But that's no reason for you not to be. Honest, I mean.  Not cleaning the pool. 
Lou has entered with a drink, which he sets next to Barton. Lou sits. 
Barton looks around, takes the drink, sips at it greedily, but must finally take the plunge. 
BARTON Well... to be honest, I'm never really comfortable discussing a work in progress.  I've got it all worked out in my head, but sometimes if you force it out in words  prematurely  the wrong words  well, your meaning changes, and it changes your own mind, and you never get it back  so I'd just as soon not talk about it. 
Lipnik stares at him. His smile has disappeared. There is a long beat. 
Lou Breeze clears his throat. He apparently feels obliged to fill the silence. 
LOU ...Mr. Fink. Never mind me. Never mind how long I've been in pictures. Mr. Lipnik has been in pictures just about since they were invented. HE practically invented them. 
Lipnik has turned to look curiously at Lou. 
LOU ...Now I think if he's interested in what one of his contract employees is doing while he draws pay, I think that employee ought to tell him, if he wants to stay an employee. Right now the contents of your head are the property of Capitol Pictures, so if I were you I would speak up. And pretty goddamn fast.

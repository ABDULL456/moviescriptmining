MALAHIDE Tiffany. Come. I have a whole new world of puzzles for you to enjoy ... 
It reaches out its hand to her. 
MALAHIDE A whole new world of pleasures for you to endure. 
TIFFANY, confused and used to obeying her doctor's voice, tentatively stretches out her arm to meet the MALAHIDE CENOBITE's. 
LARRY suddenly walks between TIFFANY and MALAHIDE.  The expression on his face is strange; it is not fear, nor defiance. It is simpler than that.  He is really, really pissed off. 
LARRY No.  I've had enough of this shit. Who the hell are you? 
KIRSTY It's ... 
LARRY waves a hand at her, but keeps his eyes on MALAHIDE. 
LARRY Never mind.  Never mind. 
He points a finger at MALAHIDE's face, which is attempting a version of PINHEAD's imposing glacial stars, but frankly, isn't quite making it. 
LARRY Fuck you and the horse you rode in on. 
Suddenly, he forms a fist with his unwounded arm and smashes it straight into MALAHIDE's face.  MALAHIDE is completely decked. 
LARRY grabs TIFFANY by the shoulders and speaks urgently to her. 
LARRY O.K.  You've done it before.  You can do it again.  GET US OUT OF HERE! 
The three of them run back up the catwalk. 
LEVIATHAN spins wildly and a myriad of black beams flow from it. As they shine into the catwalk they become limbs like those that captured MALAHIDE, but all with different tips; some are organic, vicious mouths, some are hooks or blades, some are faces, some are (as if LEVIATHAN Is too angry to be thinking straight) beautiful flowers. 
The limbs fly up the catwalk, but the HUMANS have gained too great a start.  The limbs retract rapidly into the black lights. 
MALAHIDE staggers to his feet, just as LEVIATHAN re-directs its energy into forming and projecting one much fatter limb.  It is dirty pink and segmented, like a vast earthworm.  The end peels back as it flies toward MALAHIDE, revealing a cruel, metallic, and rapidly-spinning surgical saw. 
Just as MALAHIDE stands up straight, the limb smashes into the back of his skull.  There is a distressing WHIRRING noise as the limb seals itself fleshily to MALAHIDE's skull and the former surgeon twitches and dances in horrible involuntary movements as LEVIATHAN takes over what little mind remains. 
101   INT  CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH 
KIRSTY, TIFFANY and LARRY are running, TIFFANY making the decisions as to direction. 
Down one corridor, blades and knives jut out from the opposite walls at random intervals and they have to weave at high speed between them. They negotiate the corridor successfully but, just as KIRSTY, bringing up the rear, emerges from it, she stumbles and half-falls. The re-structured BOX falls from her pocket and rolls back a few feet up the corridor. 
TIFFANY, who is nearest to her, helps her to her feet and, as she does so, catches sight of the BOX (or white diamond, as it is now). She makes as it to go and get it. KIRSTY holds her arm. 
KIRSTY No. Come on. We have to get out of here. 
TIFFANY moves away with KIRSTY, but not without a backward glance and a puzzled expression. 
They all make another turning. Suddenly, when they are about halfway down this next corridor, a new gap opens up behind them in the wall and a terrible sucking noise is heard.  Corridor debris disappears into the vacuum. 
Luckily, LARRY has reached the end of the corridor and grasps the corner with one hand, seizing KIRSTY's hand with the other. KIRSTY grabs TIFFANY and the three of them flatten themselves against the wall, fighting against the suction.  The force is tremendous and LARRY's finger are slowly losing hold. 
102   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH 
CLOSE UP on a hand picking up the re-structured BOX from the corridor floor they have just left. 
103   INT.   CORRIDORS/LABYRINTH 
The sucking force is growing stronger by the second. Not only is LARRY's right hand losing its grip on the edge of the wall, but his left arm - stretched tight as it clings to KIRSTY and, via her, TIFFANY - is bleeding profusely again. 
Suddenly, JULIA appears at the top of the corridor next to LARRY. In her hand is the white diamond BOX that KIRSTY had let drop. She stays just out of range of the sucking wind.  She stares at LARRY's weakening fingers and smiles. 
JULIA Oh, poor Larry.  You never could hold on to anything for very long, could you? 
Suddenly, audaciously, his face set in a scowl of anger, LARRY lets go of the wall.  Before she realises what is happening, he has grabbed JULIA's wrist and pulled her off her feet into the corridor. He lets go almost immediately and with a superhuman effort grabs at the corner again before the wind can claim him and the girls. 
JULIA is not so lucky; without support or foothold, she is seized by the wind and hurtles to the gap in the wall. 
She manages to brake herself by flinging her arms out to either side of her. For a moment she is hold there and then the pressure begins to draw her in.

INT. AUDITORIUM - DAY 
Puff, thirties, dirty, scraggly hair and beard but in a crisp business suit, testifies before a congressional committee. The auditorium is filled with reporters and spectators. Puff sits in front of a microphone, counsel at his side. He pours himself a glass of water, drinks, clears his throat, then speaks: stentorian, confident. 
PUFF I am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all of us. Your's is a complicated, sad world. 
This is a revelation to the assembled crowd. People whisper to each other. 
PUFF And I never knew that. I was living a life of simplicity, of purity, when I was ripped out of my Eden and immersed in this harshness. Some would argue that the life I was living was not a human life at all. And, gentlemen, I don't have any clever retort. I am not a philosopher. The only thing I know is that I am sorry, sorry for my expulsion from Eden, sorry for my Lila rotting in her jail cell, and sorry for Nathan... rotting in his grave.

INT. WHITE SPACE - DAY 
Nathan, thirties, in a white robe, sits alone at a white table. Everything is white except for an oozing bullet wound in Nathan's temple. 
NATHAN I don't even know what sorry means anymore. It's odd. When I was alive I knew -- maybe it was all I knew -- but here sorry is meaningless. Love is meaningless. Jealousy is meaningless. Ambition is meaningless. Everything that motivated my every breath while I was alive is meaningless now. (beat) I guess that's how I can be sure I'm really dead.

INT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Lila watches the slowly churning tape recorder reels, fixated. The cop who vomited is mopping it up. The other two are sipping coffee. Lila talks. 
LILA My story begins when I was twelve. 
COP (checks watch) Jesus. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 
It's got that faded, "memory" look. Twelve year old Lila hurries home from school, books clutched to her chest. 
Other kids walk along the street in pairs or groups, laughing and chatting. Lila walks alone, a worried scowl on her face. 
LILA (V.O.) Something terrible happened when I was twelve. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM - DAY 
Colors are still muted. It looks to be somewhere in the early 70's based on the preponderance of Bay City Rollers posters on the wall. Twelve year old Lila enters the room, closes the door, locks it, rattles the doorknob to make sure that the door is really locked. She draws the shades. She pulls some t-shirts from her dresser drawer and stuffs them into the space between the bottom of the door and the floor. 
KID BROTHER (O.S.) (muffled) Hey, no fair! 
TWELVE YEAR OLD LILA Drop dead, Eric. 
Lila stands nervously in front of the full-length mirror on her closet door. She takes a deep breath and begins to unbutton her shirt, watching herself carefully in the mirror. 
ADULT LILA (V.O.) Something terrible started to happen to my body when I was twelve. My mother said because of it I would never be able to get a man, so I should get used to the idea of dedicating my life to the pursuit of knowledge, or religion... or whatever. 
Lila's shirt is now unbuttoned. She pulls it open. She is wearing a training bra over the very beginning of breast buds. On the chest above the bra, and on her stomach below it, is hair. Dark curly hair. She stares at it, touches it cautiously. Then she starts to cry. She crouches into a ball and weeps. 
ADULT LILA (V.O.) The doctor said... 
CUT TO: 
INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
Old fashioned office. Twelve year old Lila sits on the examination table, her shirt off. An elderly male doctor touches the hair, fingers it. Her mother looks on. 
DOCTOR (to the mother) It's hormonal. Nature is a funny and complex thing. It could get worse with time. 
Young Lila turns to the camera. 
TWELVE YEAR OLD LILA By the time I was twenty I looked like an ape.

RAY Well, alright then. What do you think about this new tie? 
BOUNCER Sharp. 
RAY I look good tonight. And I feel lucky, too. 
Ray heads inside. 
BOUNCER Anyone asks, it wasn't me who let you in. 
Ray slides through the crowd, pausing at the bar to nibble on the neck of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS. 
COCKTAIL WAITRESS Don't even try it. 
RAY When do you get off? 
COCKTAIL WAITRESS I get off at two, but you ain't never getting off. 
She carries a tray of drinks into the crowd. Ray shakes his head in wonderment at her departing form. The BARKEEP steps up as Ray pulls out his bottle. 
BARKEEP You can't drink that in here, Ray. 
RAY I sure can't drink that watered-down swill you're serving. Give me a glass of ice. 
BARKEEP I can't give you a glass of ice. I can't give you anything until you pay your damn tab. 
Disregarding the warning, Ray tilts the bottle back. Shaking his head, the barkeep moves on to a paying customer. Ray's eyes follow a bottle of French Champagne as it is delivered to a nearby table. 
Here sits the straight-laced CLAUDE BANKS with his girlfriend, DAISY. She's enjoying the show. He's polishing the silverware. The WAITER pours two glasses of champagne and leaves the bottle on ice. Claude regards his glass skeptically. 
CLAUDE For the kind of money they charge here, you'd think they could hire somebody to actually wash the dishes. 
DAISY Claude. Here's to your new job down at the bank. I always knew you'd make something of yourself. 
CLAUDE Know what I'm going to buy with my first pay check? 
Daisy thinks she does. She leans in, eyes twinkling. 
CLAUDE Season tickets to the Yankees. Right there on the first base line. (off her disappointment) What's wrong, baby? 
DAISY I was hoping you were gonna say an engagement ring, Claude. 
French Champagne shoots out of Claude's nose. 
CLAUDE Engagement ring! 
DAISY That's what respectable folks do. Get a job, get married, start having babies. That's what you want, isn't it? 
CLAUDE Sure it is. I just don't see any reason to rush into things. Damn, look at this shirt. I'll be right back. 
Claude leans in to kiss Daisy on the lips. She offers her cheek. He departs. 
OVER BY THE BAR 
Ray watches Claude make a beeline for the men's room. 
INT. MEN'S ROOM -- NIGHT 
Claude steps into the bathroom and approaches the sink. A big hand falls on his shoulder and yanks him backwards into a stall... 
INT. STALL -- NIGHT 
Claude is shoved down on the toilet by two BAG MEN in suits. Suddenly, it's crowded in here. 
BAG MAN #1 Congratulations, Claude. We understand you finally got yourself a job. 
BAG MAN #2 Guess that means you can pay Mr. Riley the fifty bucks you owe him. 
They rifle through Claude's jacket and quickly find his wallet. 
CLAUDE Now wait a second, guys. I've got a bill to pay out there. 
BAG MAN #1 Twenty-two dollars. Not bad for a start. 
They toss back his empty wallet. 
CLAUDE Come on, fellas, that's two weeks pay. I'm here with my girl. You gotta leave me something. 
BAG MAN #2 How about your legs? 
CLAUDE My legs? Those are good, I'll keep the legs... 
The stall door swings shut as the bag men depart. 
INT. SPANKY'S -- NIGHT

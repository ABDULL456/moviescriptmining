EXT. LAUGHTER, COLORADO - DAY 
Half a dozen abandoned shacks and a boarded up gas station make up the central hub of Laughter, Colorado. She'd be a ghost town âcept the ghosts considered her a shithole ages ago and baled. The buck ten for leaded sign gives us an idea how long ago this place went dry. Suddenly an old Chevy RIPS around the corner, wheels sending PLUMES of dust skyward. 
INT. OLD CHEVY - DAY 
Three grimy looking fuckers are stuffed into the cab. FUCKING DRIVER looks as though he may piss himself. FUCKING MIDDLE twists around, glares through the back glass and FUCKING PASSENGER white-knuckles a tire iron. 
FUCKING DRIVER Goddamned old man! 
FUCKING PASSENGER I thought he was dead! She said he was dead! 
FUCKING MIDDLE I don't see him. Just go. I think we lost him. 
EXT. LAUGHTER - MAIN STREET - DAY 
They race through the dusty derelict little town, peeling for the main road in the distance when they round a corner -- --to face a â70 PLYMOUTH ROADRUNNER, beat to shit, engine screaming. SPEEDING head on. This ain't chicken because these three Fuckers don't even have time to react before: 
MILTON âThe Old Manâ, shock of white hair, drives the Roadrunner, locks the tires and spins the wheel. The Roadrunner fishtails, slides sideways AT THEM! The truck's gonna ram the driver's side. At least it would 
BUT: MILTON AIMS A SHOTGUN through the driver's side window. Fearless. Pissed off. He FIRES! 
The shot BLOOMS right at us! Then SLOWS TO NEAR FROZEN - Hanging in mid-air - suspended, like we could touch it: TITLE CARD appears-- 
"DRIVE ANGRY" --then the shot BURSTS through the title! SHATTERING the words right at us! 
ANOTHER ANGLE ...EXPLODING into the hood of the Chevy! The hood RIPS up, SLAMS the windshield. Truck CAREENS out of control! Milton GUNS the Roadrunner away from truck...but... KRAACK - The Truck nails the Roadrunner's rear quarter panel. Roadrunner and truck go into a spin. A tornado of dust SWIRLS around the two vehicles. The Roadrunner SPLINTERS into a boarded store front! The Truck HITS a ditch and UPENDS. Flips. SLAMS into the dirt on its roof, wheels SPINNING. 
ANOTHER ANGLE Smoke HISSES from the totalled Roadrunner. Door creeks open. Milton emerges slow and sure. He crosses toward the Chevy. Fucking Passenger rises from behind the truck and rushes Milton, tire iron held high over his head! Milton spins and KUH-FOOM! --blows Fucking Passenger's hand clean off! Passenger screams as Milton snatches the iron out of the air and -- 
KER-ACK! -- slams it across his face! Passenger drops. Hard. Milton stoops, removes Passenger's wallet, digs the cash out. 
OVER MILTON'S SHOULDER Fucking Driver scrambles from behind the wheel, springs to his feet and runs. 
Milton spins, BLOWS his knee apart from 20 paces. Driver SCREAMS and face-firsts the cracked pavement. 
ANOTHER ANGLE As Fucking Middle drags himself from the passenger side. He got the worst of it. Looks like his face went through the windshield. He looks up -- -- into the barrel of Milton's shotgun. A beat. 
FUCKING MIDDLE I'll never tell you where they've taken her...NEVER. 
MILTON I know. The EXPLOSION vaporizes what's left of his face. 
ON FUCKING DRIVER As he tries to stand but his lower leg dangles from a piece of cartilage. He falls, WRITHES on the ground. He looks up at Milton standing over him. 
FUCKING DRIVER You...you took my leg you fuck! Milton presses the shotgun barrel into the man's good knee.

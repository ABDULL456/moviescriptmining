M.S. DANNY eating sandwich. 
DANNY Yeah, I guess so. 
CUT TO: 
M.S. WENDY 
WENDY What about Tony?  He's looking forward to the hotel, I bet. 
CUT TO: 
M.S. DANNY while eating sandwich wiggles forefinger of his L.hand and speaks with different voice. 
TONY NO, I ain't Mrs. Torrance. 
CUT TO: 
M.S. WENDY 
WENDY Oh come on, Tony.  Don't be silly. 
CUT TO: 
M.S. DANNY wiggles forefinger of L.hand and speaks with different voice. 
TONY I don't want to go there, Mrs. Torrance. 
CUT TO: 
M.S. WENDY 
WENDY Well, how come you don't want to go?

TONY I just don't. 
CUT TO:

INT. OVERLOOK HOTEL/ULLMAN'S OFFICE - DAY - M.L.S. 
JACK over ULLMAN seated at desk.  BILL WATSON enter office. JACK rises and shakes hands with him. 
ULLMAN Bill, I'd like you to meet Jack Torrance. 
WATSON How do you do? 
JACK Bill, how do you do? 
WATSON Pleased to meet you. 
JACK Pleasure to meet you. 
ULLMAN Grab a chair Bill, and join in. 
WATSON & JACK sit down. 
ULLMAN Jack is going to take care of the Overlook for this winter.  I would like you to take him around the place as soon as we are through. 
WATSON Fine. 
ULLMAN Jack is a schoolteacher. 
CUT TO: 
M.C.S. JACK. 
JACK Eh - formerly a school-teacher. 
WATSON (OFF) What line of work are you in now? 
JACK I'm a writer um... Teaching has been more or less a way of making ends meet. 
CUT TO: 
M.C.S. WATSON. 
WATSON Well this ought to be quite a change for you. 
CUT TO: 
M.C.S. JACK 
JACK Well, I'm looking for a change. 
ULLMAN (OFF) Our people in Denver recommended Jack very highly, and, for once, I agree with them. 
CUT TO: 
M.S. ULLMAN 
ULLMAN Let's see, where were we?  Yes.  I was about to explain that eh... our season here runs from oh May 15th to October 30th and then we close down completely until the following May. 
CUT TO: 
M.C.S. JACK 
JACK Do you mind if I ask why you do that?  It seems to me that the skiing up here would be fantastic. 
ULLMAN (OFF) Oh, it sure would be 
CUT TO: 
M.S. ULLMAN 
ULLMAN (CONT'D) but the problem is the enormous cost it would be to keep the road to the Sidewinder open.  It's a... It's a 25 mile stretch of road - gets an average of 20 feet of snow during the winter, and there's just no way to make it economically feasible to keep it clear.  When the place was built in 1907, there was very little interest in winter sports, and this site was chosen for its seclusion and scenic beauty. 
CUT TO: 
M.L.S. ULLMAN over WATSON & JACK. 
JACK Well, it's certainly got plenty of that. 
JACK laughs. 
ULLMAN That's right.  And did they give you any idea in Denver about what the job entails? 
JACK Only in a very general way. 
ULLMAN Well... 
CUT TO: 
M.S. ULLMAN 
ULLMAN (CONT'D) ...the winters can be fantastically cruel, and the basic idea is to...to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur.  And this consists mainly of running the boiler, heating different parts of the hotel on a daily rotating basis, repairing damage as it occurs and doing repairs, so that the elements can't get a foothold.

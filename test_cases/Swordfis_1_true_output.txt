STANLEY How about you, almost done? 
HOLLY (folding up road map) Yep.   Got it all figured out. 
STANLEY Well, let's do it. 
They leave table. 
EXT. DINER - SOMEWHERE IN ARIZONA - DAY 
They exit diner. Make their way to a new SUV with a thirty foot tricked out Airstream trailer stretched out behind it. 
STANLEY By the way, where exactly are we going? 
HOLLY The Petrified Forest. 
STANLEY The Petrified Forest. 
Stanley opens the driver side door of the SUV.

111A. 
179   CONTINUED:                                                     179 
HOLLY Right.   And I'm driving. 
Holly climbs into the vehicle, as if to take the wheel. Stanley slides in next to her. 
STANLEY Scoot over, you. 
WIDE SHOT 
WE CRANE UP and AWAY as the vehicle pulls out of the desert truck stop... 
HOLLY (V.O.) Know why they call it the Petrified Forest? 
STANLEY (V.O.) No.   Why? 
... and drives off down the road. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
FADE IN: 
180   EXT. CREDIT SUISSE (MONTE CARLO) - DAY                        180 
A MAN, whom we have not seen before but does maintain a certain "Gabriel" air about him, hiding behind shades, leans against a three-hundred-year-old column reading a newspaper. 
She walks toward him and he signals for the valet. 
WOMAN FROM BANK You're not fucking gonna believe this. Stanley -- 
MAN -- How much he leave? 
WOMAN FROM BANK 500 bucks. 
He takes the $500 in cash from her hand and hands her the paper. They walk down to the dock, where a 50-foot off- shore cigarette boat waits, a valet standing next to it. 
He hands the valet the $500. Stepping down into the cigarette boat, he grins up at Ginger. 
GINGER (WOMAN) (steppng in next to him) You don't seem that upset. 
MAN Did you ever see the Maltese Falcon? 
She looks at him as he CRANKS UP the CIGARETTE and backs away from the pier. 
MAN 1941. Nominated for three Academy Awards, lost, but what the fuck does the Academy know anyway. John Houston's first film and probably Bogey's best. 
He turns the BOAT around and POWERS out of the bay. 
MAN At the end, when they realize the bird's a fake, and all they had gone through and sacrificed was for nothing, Gutman, the bad guy in the movie, says, 'well, sir, what do you think, shall we stand here, shed tears, and call each other names, or shall we go to Istanbul?' (CONTINUED) 
180   CONTINUED:                                                       180 
GINGER Istanbul?   What's in Istanbul? 
MAN The, ah, stuff dreams are made of. 
GINGER Huh? 
They both smile as the CIGARETTE disappears toward the horizon. 
FADE OUT.

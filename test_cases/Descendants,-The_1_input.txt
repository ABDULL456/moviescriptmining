ALEXANDRA Do you need help?

JULIE (over her shoulder) No, no, I got it. 
Alex is glad to keep her ringside seat for the moment.       All buckle their mental seatbelts. 
MATT Elizabeth is dying. Oh, wait. Fuck you. And she's dying. We unhooked her from the machines this morning. She'll be dead in a few days. 
ALEXANDRA We're not here to hurt you. We just thought she'd want you to know. 
As they've plotted, Alex and Matt study Brian's paralyzed face. They exchange a glance, then look back at him. 
ALEXANDRA (CONT'D) This is him? Why would she go for him? 
MATT Beats me.    Well, he's very articulate. 
BRIAN SPEER I can't... I'm sorry. I never thought it would come to this. 
ALEXANDRA You're sorry my mom's going to die? You're sorry you fucked her? You're sorry you fucked over my dad? 
BRIAN SPEER I'm sorry for all of it. 
MATT Look, pal, like she said, I'm not here to wreck your life. I just came to give you a chance to go to the hospital. I don't know how long you're planning on being here, but I'm sure you can think of an excuse to leave. 
ALEXANDRA You must be good at that. 
MATT You can be alone with her to say goodbye or whatever you want. Do you hear what I'm saying?

Brian seems deeply lost in his own thoughts.     Then -- 
BRIAN SPEER Okay, look, I can't have you here.     You understand. 
Julie returns with wine for Matt and a soda for Alex. 
JULIE Here we go. (noticing) Everyone's so serious. Please don't tell me you're talking about business. 
ALEXANDRA We're talking about love. 
JULIE That's nice. Brian, call the boys in for dinner. 
BRIAN SPEER They're fine. Let them play a while longer. 
They all stand there a moment. Matt's unsure how to play this out. He shoots a quick panicked look at Alex, who scrambles to keep the ball rolling. 
ALEXANDRA Awesome cottage you're renting. 
MATT Yeah, say, prime Hanalei location. I used to come here as a kid before it was a vacation rental. Alex, your great-uncle Warren and Aunt Lillian built it back in the 20s. Haven't been inside in years. 
JULIE Come on.   We'll give you a tour. 
ALEXANDRA Or, Brian, maybe you could give my dad a little walk down memory lane, and Julie and I can chat out here. 
MATT Yeah, I'd like that, if you don't mind. Just a quick look.

BRIAN SPEER Sure.    But it's not like I live here. 
Matt walks up to the door, making a point to let Brian open it for him.

Brian sweeps his hand around the room. 
BRIAN SPEER Here it is. 
MATT How did you meet?    I'm curious. 
For a moment Brian looks tricked, as if Matt really did just want a tour of the house. 
BRIAN SPEER I can't do this. 
MATT Neither can I.    How did you meet? 
BRIAN SPEER I thought you said you came here just to tell me. 
MATT I changed my mind. And I can't very well ask her the details. How'd you meet?

EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY 
Rory's boys stop the van outside Ed's and back up to Ed's front door. The rear van door is opened when it is completely flush and Lenny (with gun) prepares to do his worst. 
INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY 
There is a loud bang and the front door disappears. In its place is a large black man pointing an even larger machine gun. Nobody seems to be at home; it appears to be quite an anti-climax. A long pause follows as both gangs don't quite know what to do. Rory's guys jump over the machine gun to explore further. 
PLANK (under his breath) What the fuck is going on here? 
Dog's lot are confused as to why these guys appear to have broken into their own home, carrying weapons of mass-destruction and looking to use them. We cut to a close-up of Plank's pov under the sofa. He can see numerous pairs of boots and they are multiplying. At last Plank can't take any more; his finger's shaking too much on the trigger. BANG.' 
EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY 
We see the windows shattering from the outside as bullets hail through. 
INT. ED AND BACON'S BACK ROOM - DAY 
Dog, who was counting the spoils in the adjoining room, is more than aware of the seriousness of the situation. He quickly closes his suitcase of money and grabs the two old guns, opens the adjoining door, gets splattered in blood and smoke and quickly closes it. He then checks his escape route out of the front window and exits. Dog looks quite pleased with himself as he still has the money and his life, and is holding the infamous guns in each hand like a Mexican bandit. 
EXT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY 
Big Chris, watching the house, intrigued and interested by all the activity, has made his way closer, and low and behold: looks what walks straight into him. 
BIG CHRIS Got something here for me, have ya? (Dog is stunned by this) Come on, chop chop. 
Before Dog has a chance to use the shotguns Chris grabs one in each hand and knocks Dog down with a swift headbutt. Dog moans, not knowing what day of the week it is. Chris opens the case, sees it's full of money, takes the two shotguns, then leaves. Thank you very much. 
On reaching the car he gives the case to his son, putting the guns on the back seat. 
Count that son, and put your seatbelt on. 
INT. SCOUSERS' CAR - DAY 
DEAN Follow that car, Gary; he's got the fucking guns. 
INT. ED AND BACON'S HOUSE - DAY 
Ed's place has been shot to pieces. Only Rory and Winston (in shock) seem to be left. Rory is throwing the bags of weed into the back of his van, then he kicks over one of the bodies. It's a blood-covered Plank. 
RORY BREAKER This is one of them. 
Winston nods in confirmation. 
Lucky, that. 
Bang' Bang! Plank (to Rory's surprise) still had a loaded gun. Rory and Plank despatch each other simultaneously. 
INT. ED'S CAR (MOVING) - DAY 
Tom, Bacon, Ed and Soap look hung-over Ed is driving. 126 
TOM There's six black cocks sitting on the side of the road. How many beaks have they got between them? 
SOAP Six. 
TOM How many wings have they got between them? 
SOAP Twelve. 
TOM How many feet? 
SOAP Er, well, twelve.

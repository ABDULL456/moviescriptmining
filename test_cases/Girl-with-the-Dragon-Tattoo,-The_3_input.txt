As he tries to get some logs in the fireplace going, using more pages torn from one of his books, Erika wraps herself in a blanket. The cat, who has no trouble with the cold, naps on the paperwork on the desk. BLOMKVIST What have I missed besides you? ERIKA The steady exodus of two-thirds of our advertisers. 
BLOMKVIST Seriously? 
ERIKA Is that hard to believe? Sitting up here in Lappland with your cat? 
BLOMKVIST I'm not.   I'm working. 
ERIKA I can see. What she can see is the Vanger research covering the walls and table surfaces, and that the threads of the family tree lead to a photograph of Vanger at the top. 
BLOMKVIST Would you like to meet him? 
ERIKA Maybe in about an hour.      If you're interested. 
He is. 108   INT. VANGER MANOR - EVENING                                108 
Vanger and Martin all but ignore Blomkvist as they chat with Erika over dinner. They seem charmed by her. 
VANGER I apologize if you're having financial problems at the magazine in Mikael's absence. ERIKA We'll work through them. VANGER Are you sure? 
Erika looks at Blomkvist, but he hasn't talked to them about this. 
MARTIN How long do you think you can hang on? Six months or so? ERIKA That sounds about right. 
VANGER (cheerfully) You know, I used to be in the newspaper business. We owned six dailies back in the 50's. MARTIN We still own one. The Courier, here in town. 
VANGER I let my nephew Birger run it since he can't run anything else. 
Erika nods politely. MARTIN So what do you say to taking on a partner?

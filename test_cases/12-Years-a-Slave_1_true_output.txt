SOLOMON I reckon them at more than twelve feet at their most narrow. Wide enough for a tub to traverse. A team of niggers can clear it out. 
TIBEATS And you know what of transport and terra formin'?

SOLOMON I labored repairing the Champlain canal, on the section over which William Van Nortwick was superintendent. With my earnings I hired several efficient hands to assist me, and I entered into contracts for the transportation of large rafts of timber from Lake Champlain to Troy. 
FORD 
(TO TIBEATS) I'll admit to being impressed even if you won't. 
(TO SOLOMON) Collect a gang, see what good you can do. 
EXT. CREEK - DAY 
-END OF JUNE, 1841- WE HAVE A SERIES OF SCENES in which we see Solomon and a TEAM OF BLACKS working on the creek: CHOPPING TREES ALONG THE BANKS, widening out the shore... It's all just a trial for now. The work is diligent, but it is basic to this point. Still, under Solomon's direction, the slaves go at it like they've got something to prove. And rightly they do. Solomon also works on a narrow raft of twelve cribs with which he will transport the timber. Once this is constructed, HE PERSONALLY "SAILS" THEM UP 
THE CREEK WITH A TEST LOAD. 
EXT. FORD'S WORK AREA - LATER 
Ford and a group of slaves wait along the river banks just beyond the WORK AREA. All are expectant in their manner. A long moment passes with no sign of Solomon. Then, from up river, we see Solomon's raft of lumber winding its way. SLAVES CHEER, and Ford literally applauds the effort. Tibeats looks pissed. He has just been shown up after all. 
EXT. FORD PLANTATION/GREAT HOUSE - DAY 
As we come into the scene, Ford is presenting Solomon with a fiddle. Not as grand as the one he previously owned in New York, but a fine instrument none the less. It is a gift of thanks for his hard work. Solomon's gratitude is easily expressed. 
(CONTINUED) 
78 CONTINUED: 78 
SOLOMON My great thanks, Master Ford. 
FORD My thanks to you, and it is the least of it. My hope is that it brings us both much joy over the years. Following the statement, Solomon's not sure how to react. He remains grateful, but the thought of "over the years" is just a reminder of the altered state in which he now finds himself. 
EXT. FORD PLANATION/SLAVE SHACK - EVENING 
-END OF JULY, 1841- The slaves eat. All tired from a days work they conduct themselves in silence. All except for Eliza who, SLIPPING INTO PERMANENT DEPRESSION, as always weeps. The sound of her sobbing edging him up - particularly after Master Ford's "over the years" observation. Solomon 
FINALLY SNAPS: 
SOLOMON Eliza. Eliza, stop! Solomon goes to her, grabs Eliza. She does not stop. As if to force the misery from her, Solomon SHAKES ELIZA 
VIOLENTLY. 
SOLOMON (CONT'D) Stop it! Stop! 
ELIZA It's all I have to keeps my loss present. 
SOLOMON You let yourself be overcome by sorrow. You will drown in it. 
ELIZA Have you stopped crying for your children? You make no sounds, but will you ever let them go in your heart? 
SOLOMON ...They are as my flesh... 
(CONTINUED) 
79 CONTINUED: 79 
ELIZA Then who is distressed? Do I upset the Mistress and the Master? Do you care less for my loss than their well being? 
SOLOMON Master Ford is a decent man. 
ELIZA He is a slaver. 
SOLOMON Under the circumstances-- 
ELIZA Under the circumstances he is a slaver! Christian only in his proclamations. Separated me from my precious babies for lack of a few dollars. But you truckle at 
HIS BOOT-- 
SOLOMON No...

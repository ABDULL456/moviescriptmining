Helena is behind him reading a file. 
LIONEL (entering) Here's another one he's refusin'. 
He throws a telegram onto an already large stack. 
HELENA Why don't you read it? 
LIONEL Don't like telegrams. All them STOPS and stuff. 
HELENA Make you dizzy, Lionel. 
LIONEL A little bit. 
Fred eyes the telegram, then impulsively grabs it, ripping it open. 
FRED "Would be honored if you place my name in nomination for President. STOP. The party needs you. STOP. Yours sincerely, Al Smith." 
LIONEL Who's he? 
HELENA The Governor of New York. handing it to Lionel) Why don't you slide it under his door? 
LIONEL All right. Probably slide it right back. 
Lionel leaves. Fred and Helena are silent for a moment. 
FRED He won't go. He doesn't want to be seen walking on crutches or being wheeled to the podium. 
HELENA The millions listening on radio won't be able to see that. 
FRED But all the people at the convention will. 
Helena nods, "That's right."

INT. COTTAGE - AFTERNOON Responding to a knock at the door, Roy gets up from sitting on the couch with Franklin, sullen and inattentive. H e opens the door to Louis who walks right in. 
ROY Good afternoon, Mr. Howe. 
LOUIS Hello, Roy. 
Roy takes his hat and coat and exits to the bedroom. 
LOUIS I can't believe you've made me come all the way back to this hell hole! 
FRANKLIN I've done no such thing. 
F 
LOUIS I'm here to take you to Houston. You started your speech yet? 
FRANKLIN I'm not going. 
He stares at Franklin, drinking. Shaking his head, he goes over to the sidebar and pours one for himself. 
LOUIS You know what this is, don't you? It's a golden opportunity. A springboard for you to run for Governor. 
ranklin is silent. Frustrated, Louis takes a seat in Franklin's empty wheelchair. 
LOUIS Ever hear of a Civil War General named Francis Nicholls? 
FRANKLIN No. 
LOUIS Well, I never heard of him either. But this was one brave son-of-a- bitch. Fought for the Confederacy and lost his left arm in one battle and his left foot in another. Then after the war he ran and won the Governorship of Louisiana -- twice! 
FRANKLIN He was a war hero. 
LOUIS (with emphasis) Twice. (a beat) Look, I've worked like a dog to keep your name in play, grovelling at the feet of the powers-that-be in back rooms. 
FRANKLIN As much for you as for me. 
LOUIS I'll be damned if I'm going to let you pass up a chance like this. It's time -- and you're ready.

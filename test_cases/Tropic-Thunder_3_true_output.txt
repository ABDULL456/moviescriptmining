Tropic Thunder 31. LAZARUS (cont'd) Retarded? Maybe. Had braces on his legs, he charmed the pants bff Nixon, and won a ping-pong competition. Peter Sellers, "Being There", infantile? Yes. Retarded? No. He claps a hand on Speedman's shoulder. 
LAZARUS You went full retard, man. You never go 14 full retard. Don't believe me? Ask Sean Penn, 2001, I am Sam. Went full retard. Went home empty handed. Speedman sees this for the truth it is. How could he be so stupid? 
LAZARUS (cruelly, driving it home) But hey, man! Who knows? Four Leaf could be your ticket to Oscar gold. I'd lose the hook hands though... cripples don't give the Academy wood either. 
SPEEDMAN 
(DAZED) Oh. Lazarus laughs and excuses himself by rattling his glass and heading for the bar. Speedman stands hurt, delicately holding the spring,roll in his hook. 
ON THE OTHER SIDE,OF THE ROOM Damien paces the party. He looks more miserable and high strung than ever. He discovers Redykulous, surrounded by his posse and a CAMERA CREW. 
DAMIEN Redykulous... I need to talk to you. 
REDYKULOUS What up, money. 
DAMIEN (in a hushed tone, aware of the cameras) We're having a cast meeting, right now We need to come together as a unit -- The camera crew moves in for the close-up. . .making Damien uncomfortable ... Redykulous takes it in stride. Throughout the scene he is TEXT MESSAGING someone. 
Tropic Thunder 32. 
REDYKULOUS Uh-huh... Damien is made uncomfortable by the cameraman who has i started manually zooming in and out on him in a dutch style camera move... DAMIEN i Do you mind if we step away for a moment? 
REDYKULOUS From what? Damien tries to indicate the crew. 
DAMIEN (whispering even lower now) From the...uh...you know... .this area.. 
REDYKUL:OUS Oh, I see...sure They take a few steps away from the bar... The entire camera crew follows. 
DAMIEN Oh. Hah! No, I mean away from the cameras. you understand?. Away from (indicating the crew) them... 
REDYKULOUS No. 
DAMIEN What? 
REDYKULOUS No. I can't do that. If Redykulous steps away from the cameras then my .people don't get to see the real Redykulous. The show is called "Utterly Redykulous". 
DAMIEN Well this is about work ...my show so to. .speak. Do you understand? 
REDYKULOUS I guess. But not really. Your show and my show are the same thing. This is gonna help your show, trust me.

Tropic Thunder 33. REDYKULOUS (cont'd) My show AND the soundtrack drops the same time "Tropic Thunder opens. So you get that crossover audience everybody wants on your opening weekend, which will dictate your revenue streams all the way through DVD release, pay per view, etcetera. Damien thinks this over for a second. It does sort of make sense. He then notices the chmera crew pushing in k I , 1 '144% for a close up He awkwardly tries to get away from them... 
DAMIEN Excuse me, everyone! If I could have your attention! Nothing. No one notices except Speedman. Damien grabs a couple bottles off the bar and BANGS them together. 
DAMIEN Sorry to break up the party, but I just wanted to call your attention to a cast meeting tonight! Big meeting! Future of the film depends on it! 
(UNRAVELING) Not to mention my entire bloody life! Damien in a final cry of frustration, SMASHES a bottle on the bar. He succeeds only in cutting his hand. 
DAMIEN 
GODFUCKITI SHIT! Speedman comes up, placing a calming hook on Damien's shoulder. He steps to the fore. 
SPEEDMAN (slowly, deliberately) "When... we.'.. put... aside... our... differences... we see we're kind of the same." Within moments, the place settles completely. 
SPEEDMAN (Long beat...-then almost quietly.) "When we put aside our differences, we see we're kind of the same. Let's be friends, I know we will do great things together." (beat, then more upbeat)

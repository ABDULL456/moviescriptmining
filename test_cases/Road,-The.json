{"test1_input": "MAN. I don't know. The MAN looks through a pair of BINOCULARS and sees: A stooped figure up ahead, a DYING MAN dragging one leg slightly, limping along. He stops and stands uncertainly, then continues. The BOY sees him too. \nBOY. What should we do Papa? \nMAN. We're all right. Let's just follow and watch. \nBOY. Take a look. \nMAN. Yeah. Take a look. \nEXT. ROAD/HILL - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe DYING MAN is getting slower and slower as they climb a slope, following, until he finally stops and simply sits in the road. The BOY hangs onto the MAN's coat anxiously as they approach. POV BOY - the DYING MAN is burnt, his clothing scorched and skin black with soot. One eye is burnt shut and his hair is a nitty wig of ash. His shoes are bound with wire and coated with road tar. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: As they pass by the DYING MAN looks down, averting his eyes. The BOY keeps looking, unable to take his eyes off him. \nBOY. Papa, what's wrong with that man? \nMAN. He's been struck by lightning. \nBOY. Can't we help him? Papa? \nMAN. No. We can't help him. They keep walking away and the BOY tugs at the MAN's coat. \nBOY. Papa? \nMAN. Stop it. \nBOY. Can't we help him, Papa? \nMAN. No. We can't. There's nothing to be done for him. \nEXT. BRIDGE - (CAMP 3) - EVENING \nThey are camped under the bridge, ash and slurry drift by on the river, a dull sulphur light from the fires glows against the sky. The BOY sits in silence with his back to the MAN. \nMAN. There's nothing we could have done. (NO REPLY.) He's going to die. We can't share what we have or we'll die too. \nBOY. I know. \nMAN. So when are you going to talk to me again? \nBOY. I'm talking now. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAN. Are you sure? \nBOY. Yes. \nEXT. BARN - DAY \nThey come to a barn beside the road. They look at each other. \nMAN. Let's take a look. The man picks up the revolver and they go inside cautiously. \nINT. BARN - DAY \nThree pairs of FEET wearing different shoes - a man's shoes, a woman's shoes, and a CHILD's sneakers - hang above three carefully placed chairs. \nMAN. Don't look. The BOY looks at the ground. \nMAN. (CONT'D) You don't need to see this. The BOY takes a few steps, exploring, he eyes the empty hay loft but avoids looking at the hanged bodies. \nBOY. There could be something here. There could be corn or something. \nMAN. No, they ran out of food. \nBOY. Maybe we could find some hayseeds in the hayloft? Now the BOY goes over to the swinging CORPSES, oddly curious. \n", "test1_true": "BOY. What does that mean? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAN. You know what that means. The MAN GOES outside while the BOY thinks about it a moment. \nEXT. FARM GATE - DAY \nThey walk away from the eerily silent farm, stopping at an abandoned TRACTOR by a weathered, paint stripped letter box. \nMAN. Come here. The BOY goes over and the MAN takes out his revolver, opens the magazine and shows him: two bullets in the chamber. \nMAN. (CONT'D) You see that? Two left. One for you and one for me. He places the BOY's thumb on the hammer and cocks the pistol. He curls the BOY's index finger around the trigger. \nMAN. (CONT'D) You put it in your mouth and point it up. Like this. Just like I showed you. He puts the barrel of the pistol in his own mouth until the BOY nods, wide eyed. He takes the pistol out of his mouth and uncocks it. \nMAN. (CONT'D) You got it? \nBOY. I think. \nMAN. Is it okay? \nBOY. Okay. The MAN puts the gun away and cuddles the BOY close. They set off again. \nINT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY \nFLASHBACK - the WOMAN is sitting by the window, staring out at the garden which is barren now, the sky gray but tinged with the same fireglow seen earlier, a film of gray ash covers dead lawn and shrubs and inside the paintwork is grimy and colorless now, a lot of the furniture gone. A pile of broken up furniture and pieces of the piano are-stacked up next to the fireplace. In the fireplace the scorched, ashen remains of piano keys. The WOMAN is now heavily pregnant. The MAN sets down chipped old plates and spoons, spoons beans from a pot and sits to eat. As the WOMAN starts to eat she winces and freezes with a look of horror, spoon halfway to her mouth. She looks down and \nSEES: POV WOMAN - water and blood running down her legs. \nWOMAN. Oh no. Oh no. \nMAN. It's okay, I'll help you. Just like we said. \nWOMAN. No no no... \nMAN. I'll heat water. We can do it. As he goes out she MOANS in despair. \nINT. KITCHEN/CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY \nThe MAN rushes in and opens a drawer in the sideboard. Instead of cutlery it contains a pair of kitchen shears, a bottle of antiseptic, worn but clean towels and a pair of worn out yellow rubber dish gloves, all laid out in readiness. The WOMAN appears at the door, blood running down a leg. \nWOMAN. We don't have to. \nMAN. Well, I think we probably do. \nWOMAN. What kind of life is this? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAN. It's life. It's the only thing left. He takes the WOMAN back into the other room. \nINT. DINING ROOM / CLAPBOARD HOUSE - DAY \nTERRIBLE SCREAMING. The WOMAN lies on the dining room table SCREAMING as she has her first contractions. The MAN is wearing the rubber gloves, one gloved hand resting on the WOMAN's leg, about to deliver his own baby. He wipes his brow and leaves a smear of blood as the SCREAMING goes on. \nWOMAN. I can't. \nMAN. It's coming. \nEND OF FLASHBACK. \nINT. TRAILER HOME - (CAMP 4)- EVENING \nInside a badly damaged trailer home, one wall half fallen off, a pan of water boils on a small fire. The BOY sits shivering in a blankets as he eats beans from a tin, scraping around for the last one or two. The MAN opens his knapsack by the fire and produces a packet of COCOA. He fixes a cup of cocoa for the boy. He hands the BOY the cup of cocoa and as the BOY examines it and drinks, the MAN surreptitiously pours himself a mug of water and sits blowing on it. The BOY realises the MAN has left him all the cocoa. \nBOY. You promised not to do that. \n", "test1_id": 2085, "test2_input": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nMAN. I know but you have to. You have to stop thinking about her. We both do. \nBOY. How do I do that? The MAN is silent, lost in thought. \nEXT. TRUCK/CAB - (CAMP 7) EARLY HOURS \nThe man gets down from the cab and walks a few feet in the dark and snow. He coughs a bit, takes a few breaths of air, and walks away from the truck, vanishing into the mist. \nEXT. CAMP/ROAD - (CAMP 7) - EARLY HOURS \nThe MAN is alone now by the road. He takes out his WALLET and sifts through: money, ancient cards, driver's license and a picture of HIMSELF and the WOMAN on their WEDDING DAY, which he studies a moment sadly. \nMAN. (V.0.) She was gone, and the coldness of it was her final gift... she died somewhere in the dark... there is no other tale to tell. He lays everything out on the grey slushy ground, then flings the wallet into the river and walks back to camp, leaving the PHOTO and cards to blow away. \nEXT. CLAPBOARD HOUSE/YARD - NIGHT \nFLASHBACK - The WOMAN kisses the MAN. \nMAN. Will you tell him goodbye? \nWOMAN. No. I won't. I can't. \nMAN. Will you at least wait till morning? Stay with me through the night. \nWOMAN. No. I have to go now. They kiss again, she turns and walks away out of the yard. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAN. What am I going to tell him? What are we going to do without you? \nWOMAN. You should move south. You won't survive another winter here. The MAN follows a few steps and she stops and turns to him. \nMAN. Why won't you help me? \nWOMAN. I can't help you. Don't you understand? This is how I'm helping you. \nMAN. Where are you going to go? You can't even see. \nWOMAN. I don't need to see. \nMAN. I'm begging you. \nWOMAN. Please don't. Please. The MAN stares. She goes, vanishing into the darkness. \nEND OF FLASHBACK. \nEXT. CITY LIMITS - DUSK \nThe MAN stares. In the distance, a dead city. \nEXT. OVERPASS/CITY LIMITS - EVENING \nThe MAN and the BOY approach the edge of the city. Up ahead a cluster of three tall buildings, a dozen or so floors of concrete and glass, the upper floors of one illuminated by the flickering fire glow of candle light inside. The MAN stops and stares and the BOY follows his gaze. In one of the illuminated windows a SILHOUETTE FIGURE stares back at them, somebody in the building. In another window another SILHOUETTE FIGURE is staring out, motionless, they could be refugees, cannibals or more mummified dead for all we know. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBOY. Who are they, Papa? \nMAN. I don't know. \nBOY. What if it's more bad guys? \nMAN. It won't be more bad guys. Don't worry. Stay close. He takes hold of the gun and they walk in a different direction now, giving the high rises a wide berth. \nMAN. (CONT'D) Keep low. We'll be okay. When they get to the end of the block they stop and the MAN checks around the corner before they cross the street. In the distance three men appear, emaciated, slow-moving. They step forward, stop and watch the BOY and the MAN. \n", "test2_true": "The MAN, now carrying the revolver, and the BOY head off down a railway track that leads away from the city. \nEXT. COUNTRY RAILWAY LINE - DAY \nIn the country, along the railway, they see past a small road to a once grand house on a rise. It is tall and stately with white Doric columns across the front and a gravel drive that curves up from the road through a field of dead, foot long grass. They stand there staring at it, the BOY still holding the MAN's hand. The MAN listens - nothing but the WIND in the dead bracken, a CREAK of a door or shutter rattling. \nMAN. I think we should take a look. \nBOY. I'm scared. \nMAN. There's nothing to be scared of. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY/STATELY HOME \nThe MAN sets off up the drive. He stops and faces the BOY who is rooted to the spot. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nMAN. You want to stay here? \nBOY. No. The BOY joins him and they set off slowly up the drive, through patches of melting snow. There is a tall dead privet fence with a deserted birdsnest in it. \nEXT. PORCH/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThey climb the steps to the porch, the BOY clutching the MAN's hand. They notice a window is slightly open. The MAN goes to it, opens the window wide, looks inside. \nINT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThey climb through the window onto black and white marble tiles and the MAN carefully shuts the window a little so it's the same as when he found it. They regard the room, binoculars set up on a tripod sit next to an arm chair. An elaborate staircase in front of them, William Morris wall paper, water stained and sagging, plaster moldings and cornices sagging from the ceiling. They cross back to the other side where there is a great hall of a drawing room, high ceilings, huge fire place with raw brick around it where the wood has been stripped, a pile of warm-weather clothing, boots and backpacks on the floor by the hearth. \nBOY. Papa? \nMAN. Shh. \nINT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThey creep in and find blackened pots and pans, a cord with a bell for servants, trash piled on the floor and work tops, a rusted sink covered in mould, bare cupboards. In the floor is a hatch with a lock set in a steel plate. The man examines it while the BOY tugs at his arm, frightened. \nBOY. Papa, let's go. \nMAN. There's a reason this is locked. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The BOY is now panicky, hopping about, close to tears. \nBOY. Don't open it - don't! \nMAN. I need something to pry it open. \nBOY. No! The MAN goes out abruptly and the BOY follows, wringing his hands in fear. \nEXT. BACK GARDEN/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThe MAN comes out the back door with his revolver drawn, looks around and sees an old station wagon with flat tyres on the dead grass. Beside it is a 40 gallon cauldron on the blackened remnants of a fire. There is also a wooden SMOKE HOUSE with thin wisps of smoke coming off it. The MAN studies it nervously, sniffing the air, then goes to the tool shed and starts sorting through tools. He finds a long handled spade and hefts it in his hands. \nINT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThe spade chops into the wood around the lock on the hatch. The MAN hacks away, then prizes up the hatch, lock and all, revealing a gap of darkness. \nBOY. Papa... \nMAN. Listen to me. Just stop it. We're starving. Do you understand? I have to do this. I don't have any choice. The MAN opens the hatch fully and lies it on the floor. \nMAN. (CONT'D) Just wait here. \nBOY. I'm going with you. \nMAN. Okay. Just stay close to me. Nothing's going to happen. \n", "test2_id": 2086, "test3_input": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: They descend the rough wooden steps. \nINT. CELLAR/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThere is a terrible stench and they have to cover their mouths and noses with their parkas. The MAN gets out his lighter, lights it and tries to light the way. POV MAN - BLACKNESS except the small area illuminated by the lighter as the MAN searches: part of a stone wall; then a clay floor; an old mattress with dark stains. The glow of the flame crawls across the floor to a corner as the MAN steps closer, then plays the lighter along from the corner to \nREVEAL: Huddled against the wall, all trying to hide, shielding their shining eyes from the light, NAKED MEN and WOMEN, thin as skeletons like inmates in a death camp. The BOY jumps, shocked and the MAN freezes, staring, dumb struck by: On a mattress on the floor lies a NAKED MAN with his legs gone to the hip, their stumps blackened and burned, cauterized. The BOY covers his eyes. \nMAN. Jesus... The MAN on the MATTRESS turns to them and WHISPERS, a low indistinct murmur at first. \nMAN ON MATTRESS. Help us... please help us... \nMAN. Christ... oh Christ... The others join in, an eerie chorus of WHISPERING, \"Help us... please help us...\" The MAN turns and grabs the BOY and rushes for the steps. \nMAN. (CONT'D) Hurry... go... move! The MAN drops the lighter as he tries to push the BOY up the steps. Out of nowhere a BEARDED FACE appears at the foot of the stairs, blinking. \nBEARDED FACE. Please... they're taking us to the smoke house. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The BEARDED FACE reaches out and feebly tries to grab the MAN's arm but he breaks free and concentrates on getting the BOY up the steps, following in a blind panic, fumbling and missing his footing. \nMAN. Hurry - hurry! They scramble up the steps towards the light of the hatch as the BEARDED FACE reaches out and tries one last time to grab at the MAN's feet but he kicks free. \nINT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThe MAN scrambles out, slams the door shut and drags a solid table over the door. He looks around for the BOY. \nMAN. Christ. Run! The BOY is near the window, dancing up and down in terror, pointing out the window to: \nEXT. FIELDS - DAY \nComing up the path toward the house are four BEARDED MEN and two WOMEN, all suspiciously well fed and healthy-looking. One of the MEN holds hands with one of the WOMEN, as if they were returning from a stroll before dinner. \nINT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThe MAN stares a moment, frozen with horror, then grabs the BOY by the hand and jerks him away. \nMAN. Run. Run! \nINT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThey tear through to the front door, the MAN fumbles to get it open but it has a well-maintained deadlock on it. He stares out the window next to the door and sees: POV MAN - The WELL-FED PEOPLE are climbing the steps of the porch. The MAN Grabs the BOY and they rush through into kitchen. \nINT. KITCHEN/STATELY HOME - DAY \nIn the kitchen the hatch is being lifted from underneath and the table elevating inches. They rush back out again. \nINT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY \nAs they reach the stairs, a key turns in the lock and the MAN picks up the BOY in his arms and they sprint to a door under the stairs. As they get through the door the front door swings open and the WELL-FED PEOPLE drift inside. \nINT. REST ROOM - DAY \nThey are in a small rest room under the stairs, just a toilet and a basin. The BOY's face is level with the basin and while the MAN is holding the door shut the BOY comes face to face with the contents of the basin: POV BOY - bloodstained clothing soaking in bloody water and tallow in the basin. Around the basin are bloody red hand prints on the white porcelain. POV MAN - through a thin crack he sees the WELL-FED PEOPLE on the far side of the foyer, chatting casually. He is not close enough to hear everything they say, but close enough to see that the MEN's beards are trimmed and they wear well-repaired clothes. \nWELL FED WOMAN. I'm going to freshen up. \nBEARDED MAN. I need a drink. \nWELL FED WOMAN 2. I'm going up to change. He hears one of the WOMEN STOMPING across the old floorboards and up the stairs to change while the other WOMAN takes a few steps towards the rest room, then turns back towards the window as the conversation lurches on. \nBEARDED MAN 2. Who left this window open? \nWELL FED WOMAN. I leave it open for the smell. \nBEARDED MAN 2. What smell? \nWELL FED WOMAN. You don't smell it anymore? \nBEARDED MAN. Who wants a drink? \n", "test3_true": "CONTINUED: They hear the sound of the WINDOW BEING CLOSED and LATCHED. As all this goes on, the MAN is frozen, eyes wide with fear, he slips the pistol from his belt, cocks it and squats on his haunches so he's close to the BOY, desperate, unable to decide what to do, unable to think straight with fear. The BOY is staring from the door to the pistol to the bloodied basin as if hypnotised, in shock, babbling somewhat. \nBOY. (MUMBLING, TO SELF.) Bad guys... bad men... \nMAN. Shh, shh... There are FOOT STEPS outside the door as the WELL FED PEOPLE drift closer and then away again. The man starts to cough but he has the revolver in one hand and the BOY's hand in his other. The MAN tries to stifle his cough but can't. Then the BOY notices and holds his own small hand to the MAN's mouth, stifling his coughing as the talk goes on outside: \nWELL FED WOMAN. Will you help me with the dirty dishes? \nBEARDED MAN 2. I'm hungry. As the coughing subsides a little the MAN takes the BOY's hand from his mouth and pushes the revolver into it. \nMAN. Take it. The BOY tries to resist, shaking his head, terrified, mute. \nMAN. (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D) Take it. The MAN puts his left arm around the BOY's tiny, thin shoulders and holds him close. \nMAN. (WHISPERS.) (CONT'D) Don't be afraid. If they get hold of you, you're going to have to do it just like everybody else. Do you understand? Shh. No crying. Do you hear me? The WOMAN turns from the window and one of the BEARDED MEN pours whiskey and hands her one. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) The BOY is weeping and shaking his head as the MAN shows him again what to do with the gun. \nMAN (WHISPERS.) Stop crying. You have to be a brave boy. You know how to do it. \nBOY (WHISPERS.) I think so. \nMAN (WHISPERS.) Say \"Yes I do Papa.\" He stares down at the little BOY who just holds the gun feebly... he realises the BOY won't use it. After a moment of torturous contemplation, the MAN very gently takes the gun from the BOY's hand and the BOY sits forlornly, staring down at his hands, afraid to look at the MAN now. When the BOY looks up again he is staring down the barrel of the pistol, the MAN aiming the large revolver at the BOY's forehead. \nBOY. What are you doing? The MAN's hand shakes, his thumb trembles on the hammer as he cocks it... \nBOY. (CONT'D) Papa? \nMAN. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. \nBOY. Will I see you again? When will I see you? The MAN's finger trembles on the trigger as he slowly squeezes it... At that moment there's a loud THUMP from the kitchen and the WELL FED PEOPLE stop and listen, then rush through to the kitchen, and immediately there's a commotion as they see the state of the hatch with the table over it. \nBEARDED MAN 2(O.O.V.) What the fuck do you think you're doing? Huh? What the fuck do you think you're doing...? \nWELL FED WOMAN (O.O.V.) Don't look at me like that. What are you doing? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: ( 3) The MAN gathers his wits and opens the door a crack. \nMAN. Follow me, take my hand, don't let go. \nINT. FOYER/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThe MAN bursts out of the rest room with the BOY and they make a dash for the open window. He sticks his gun in his belt and wrestles with the window, an old colonial style frame which sticks. From behind the closed kitchen door they hear muffled GRUNTS and SHOUTS until the MAN wrenches the window open, stuffs the BOY through and follows. \nEXT. PORCH/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThe MAN picks the BOY up and they rush down the steps. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY/STATELY HOME - DAY \nThey rush down the driveway and the MAN drags the BOY through a gap in the dead privet hedge onto the road. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nThey hesitate a moment on the road, deciding. \nMAN. Come on, keep running! They rush across the road to the woods on the other side, the BOY ahead as the MAN checks behind them. The MAN looks back towards the house and two of the WELL-FED PEOPLE have come outside, looking around suspiciously. He hits the ground and takes the BOY with him, they lie flat at the edge of the woods and the road. They are wildly out of breath, chests heaving, the MAN coughing. \nMAN. (CONT'D) Keep your head down. POV MAN - the WELL-FED PEOPLE walk a few steps down the drive and a BEARDED MAN looks through BINOCULARS at the road and the woods, but not directly at the MAN and the BOY hiding. The WELL FED PEOPLE start looking around the side of the house, walking away. The MAN and the BOY get up, dash through the treeline and disappear into the woods. \nEXT. WOODS - NIGHT \n.A dull moon hidden in the ashen sky and the outlines of trees as they set off through the woods, sleepy, stumbling like drunks now. They hear a hideous SHRIEK in the distance, coming from the house. They stop, hearing another SHRIEK and a MAN'S SCREAMING. The MAN holds the BOY close and tries to cover the BOY's ears as they stare and wait for-it to pass. \nMAN. We'll be safe soon. \nBOY. They're going to eat those people aren't they, Papa? The MAN does not answer. \n", "test3_id": 2087}

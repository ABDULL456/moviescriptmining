Garderobe sweeps her arm, and the gold dust magically whooshes down, settling on Belle's gown, and completing it. 
91   INT. GRAND STAIRCASE - CASTLE - NIGHT                     91 
Belle is breathtaking as she is revealed on the upper landing. 
Mustering his courage, the beast descends from the west wing. She gazes over at the beast, who looks resplendent. She sees him in a new light. 
"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST" begins. From the bottom of the staircase, Mrs. Potts watches with Chip -- 
MRS. POTTS Tale as old as time True as it can be Barely even friends Then somebody bends unexpectedly 
The beast and Belle meet on the center landing and descend the staircase. Arm in arm, they enter -- 
92   INT. BALLROOM - CASTLE - NIGHT                            92 
-- the absolutely resplendent ballroom. It has been cleaned and 
scrubbed to its former glory. The great windows offer a magnificent view of the starry night. 
MRS. POTTS Just a little change Small to say the least Both a little scared Neither one prepared Beauty and the Beast 
As the music rises, Belle bows. The beast bows in return. She offers him her hands -- and nervously, he takes them. They begin to dance, gliding across the ballroom -- 
CAMERA sweeps up to see CARVED INSTRUMENTAL FIGURES -- VIOLIN, VIOLAS, HARP -- which have come to life and are playing accompaniment with CADENZA -- sparkling with polish. 
MRS. POTTS (CONT'D) Ever just the same Ever a surprise Ever as before Ever just as sure As the sun will rise Tale as old as time Tune as old as song Bittersweet and strange Finding you can change Learning you were wrong 
ANGLE ON BEAUTY AND THE BEAST -- in this moment, nothing in the world exists except each other. Despite his bulk, the beast is careful, gentle, graceful. The lights in the ballroom grow dim as he lifts her, spinning. Belle is swept away. 
ANGLE ON THE HOUSEHOLD STAFF -- watching in mounting hope and excitement. On top of Cadenza, Lumi√®re puts an arm around Cogsworth, pulling him closer. 
MRS. POTTS (CONT'D) Certain as the sun Rising in the East Tale as old as time Song as old as rhyme Beauty and the Beast 
The lights come back up as the terrace doors open, allowing Belle and the beast to step outdoors. 
MRS.   POTTS (CONT'D) Tale as old as   time Song as old as   rhyme Beauty and the   Beast 
Chip nuzzles his mother, as Belle and the beast move out to: 
93   EXT. TERRACE - CASTLE - NIGHT                              93 
Belle and the beast stand together under the stars. 
THE BEAST I haven't danced in years.   I'd almost forgotten the feeling. 
Mustering his courage -- 
THE   BEAST (CONT'D) It's foolish,   I suppose, for a creature like   me to hope that one day he might earn   your affection. 
BELLE I don't know... 
THE BEAST Really? So you think you could be happy here? 
BELLE Could anyone be happy if they're not free? 
She gazes wistfully toward the forest. 
BELLE (CONT'D) My father taught me to dance.   I used to step on his toes a lot. 
THE BEAST You must miss him. 
BELLE Very much. 
THE BEAST (thinks, decides) Would you like to see him? 
94   INT. BEAST'S LAIR - WEST WING - CASTLE - NIGHT               94 
Belle stares into the beast's hand mirror. 
BELLE I'd like to see my father. 
A glow of magic. When it clears Belle sees Maurice -- being manhandled in the village square! He looks terrified. 
BELLE (CONT'D) Papa!   What are they doing to him?! 
The beast reacts to her suffering.   A moment of choice. 
THE BEAST (pained) You must go to him. 
BELLE What did you say?

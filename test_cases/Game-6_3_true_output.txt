Nicky is trying to understand what he sees, then he gets it. 
NICKY (quiet) Laurel. 
Nicky holds his gun hand aloft, repeating the image of Bill Buckner with the baseball in his glove -- Nicky's hallucination. 
Then Nicky issues a cry, a sound from the time before humans acquired language. It is the audible anguish of his life, from the fetus onward. 
We hear what he is saying in overlapping echoes and we realize he is crying out a name. We recognize the look on his face and the formation of syllables on his lips as elements we'd seen earlier -- on Buckner's face when he shouted something as he made N the "third out" of the tenth inning. 
NICKY Ste-vennnn Schwim-merrrr! 
Laurel reacts with horror to the revelation of Steven's identity. She rearranges her bra. 
Nicky stumbles, drops his gun. It goes off. 
Steven flees toward the shadows at the back of the loft, his hand moving toward the gun in his shoulder holster. 
Nicky picks up his gun and begins to stalk him. 
Steven fires twice striking a nearby lamp. The room is dark now. Lit only by the blue glow of the TV. 
The TV sports roundup, which has been showing football highlights, has switched to baseball -- highlights of the Red Sox-Mets. 
Nicky reaches Laurel. 
NICKY (crying out) This is my daughterrrrr! 
Steven is wide-eyed at the news. 
LAUREL I don't think he knew, Daddy. 
Nicky sees the photo of Steven and his cat. He shoots twice, blows it away. 
LAUREL Daddy, I'm sorry. But he was so beautiful. I trusted him. When I saw what he really looks like -- 
A voice from shadows: 
STEVEN (OS) Am I really so deeply repugnant? 
LAUREL Yes. 
NICKY Go home, Laurel. Tell your mother I will be late. 
Nicky walks toward Steven's voice, toward the shadows. 
NICKY You're going to die. You're a dead man. You're dead. 
He notices Laurel following behind him. 
NICKY Look. I'm sorry you keep running into dishonest men. But you're only eighteen. We can still turn it around. 
LAUREL Except I won't have a father anymore. 
NICKY I'll see you all the time. I'll get a place right nearby. One room. No distractions. We'll talk.

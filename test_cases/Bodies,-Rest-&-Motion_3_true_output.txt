ANGLE TO INCLUDE SID AND BETH 
SID That's about the saddest thing there is... losing someone you love. 
Beth is struck by a certainty that she's never lost anyone she's loved because she's never really loved anyone. 
BETH It's never happened to me. 
Sid hesitates, then speaks his heart. 
SID If you died, I couldn't stand life. 
BETH I... 
She steps forward and kisses him. She steps back. 
BETH (businesslike) I've got to go now. 
She walks out of the bathroom. Sid and THE CAMERA FOLLOW as she hurries though the living room toward the bedroom. 
IN THE LIVING ROOM 
BETH The new people'll be here. 
She disappears down the hall to the bedroom. 
SID (following) Go to my house. 
BETH (O.S.) No. 
IN THE BEDROOM 
Beth picks up her suitcases. Sid steps into the doorway. 
SID While you find a place. 
BETH No. I gotta get out. 
She heads to the bedroom door. 
SID I can talk to the realtors, I know they've got a place in Agawam. 
Beth stops. 
BETH (shaking her head) No... Agawam?... no. I don't know where I'm going. Somewhere else. 
She walks past him into the hallway. Sid and THE CAMERA FOLLOW. 
SID You can call me when you get there. I'll give you my number. 
IN THE LIVING ROOM 
She stops and puts down the suitcases. 
BETH (gently) Sid. I'm going away. You're making me way too important. You met me yesterday. 
He goes to her. 
SID And today I love you. 
She steps back, shaking her head. 
BETH Jesus... one day... 
SID That doesn't matter. You know that. It can take a second. 
Beth loses control, upset with herself for having mixed emotions, upset with her life, and upset he's making this more difficult. 
BETH No! That's... that's a fuckin' animal thing, I've done that. 
SID Not with me. 
BETH I meet men, go home with them and just stay. No decision involved -- it's just what I do. And then I don't have to live my life, I just lead theirs. I can't keep doing that. 
SID (adamant) We're not that way! 
BETH What way are we? 
SID We're passionate. We're comfortable.

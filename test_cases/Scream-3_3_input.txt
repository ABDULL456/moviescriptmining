Gale runs off. 
SIDNEY I can see nothing's changed. 
DEWEY No. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  SUNRISE STUDIO FILM ARCHIVES - DAY 
Gale's banging on the door trying to gain access. Nobody home. Gale notices the card lock and the sign reading  'AUTHORIZED PERSONAL ONLY'. Gale smiles. Since when has this ever stopped her before. She reaches into her pocket book, pulling out a couple of credit cards, a video store card, etc. She tries them in the lock. NOTHING. 
A hand reaches down, grabs Gale from behind. She lets outa blood curdling scream. It's only JENNIFER. 
JENNIFER Geez. 
GALE What the hell are you doing? 
JENNIFER Being Gale Weathers.  What the hell are you doing? 
GALE I am Gale Weathers! 
JENNIFER Here's how I see it.  I've got no house, no movie, no gun, and I'm being stalked.  Because someone wants to kill me?  No, because someone wants to kill you. So now, starting now, I go where you go.  That way, if someone wants to kill me, I'll be with you, and since they really want to kill you, they won't kill me, they'll kill you.  Make sense? 
GALE None. 
JENNIFER You know in the movies, I play you as being much smarter. 
GALE And as a sane person.  For you that must be quite a stretch. 
JENNIFER That's funny. 
GALE Ha. Maybe I should join SNL. 
JENNIFER Need to get in that building? 
GALE (sarcastically) No really? 
JENNIFER There a story in that building? 
GALE Possibly. 
JENNIFER (flashing a Sunrise Studios Key Card) Gale Weathers would find a way. (she swipes and opens the door) 
Jennifer opens the door, steps in first. Gale follows, door closing ominously behind them with a loud CLACK. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BASEMENT HALLWAY - ARCHIVES - DAY 
Gale leads the way down the dark hall. 
JENNIFER Basements creep me out. 
GALE Really, you know you'd make a fascinating interview. Lifestyles of the Rich and Psychotic. 
JENNIFER Look who's talking Moneybags. You got more homes than I do. 
GALE (smiling) Oh I wish I got that one on tape. It'd put a smile on my face everytime I'm down.

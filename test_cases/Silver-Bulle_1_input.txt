His fingers touch the bullet, but that's all. It falls in the heating vent. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU 
It's roaring, furious, its one eye flaring. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WIDE 
UNCLE AL lies senseless against one wall, the front of his shirt bloody. JANE runs into the corner and grabs the pistol. 
The WEREWOLF picks up the easy chair and throws it through the hole it made coming in. It picks up an end table and hurls it through the TV. Then it sees JANE and starts toward her. 
INT.  JANE, COWERING IN THE CORNER 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU 
Comes toward her. 
INT.  JANE IN THE CORNER 
She makes as if to run one way. 
INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF 
It's only a couple of feet from her now, but again, it is toying with her- it's making this reeeal slow. 
INT.  THE FIREPLACE TOOLS, CU 
A bloodstained hand grabs a poker. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF AND JANE 
As it tenses down to leap at her, UNCLE AL leaps at it and strikes it across the back. It turns, ROARING. 
UNCLE AL hits it between the legs. 
It BELLOWS and grabs the poker. It bends it and tosses it aside. The glaring, savage expression on its face says that now it will bend UNCLE AL and toss him aside. 
INT.  JANE 
She breaks out of the corner and runs across the room toward the door. Most of the way there she trips and falls. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU 
Its head whips around. 
INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL 
He's lying full-length. He's got the heater vent's grille off. One arm is down inside. 
MARTY (scream) Janey! The gun! THE GUN! 
INT.  JANE 
She tosses it awkwardly. 
INT.  THE GUN, SLOW MOTION 
It slides down the hall floor to MARTY like some strange, awkward shuffleboard disc, its cylinder still open. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF 
WEREWOLF (snarls) Maa-aaa-rty... 
It begins walking slowly across the living room, smashing things out of its way. 
INT.  MARTY, IN THE HALL 
The gun slides into his hand. Now he reaches into the heating duct again... 
INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU 
There's an elbow bend just below MARTY'S twisting, grasping fingers- the silver bullet lies here. It's less than half an inch out of reach. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU 
WEREWOLF (foaming) Maaa-aaa-rty... 
INT.  JANE, ON THE FLOOR 
JANE (sobbing) Don't you hurt him! Don't you hurt my brother! 
She bites one of the WEREWOLF'S hairy ankles as it passes. 
INT.  JANE AND THE WEREWOLF 
It roars with pain and kicks her aside. Then it looks back into the hall. It is grinning. I believe it is thinking this is going to be better than a Thanksgiving dinner you don't have to pay for. 
WEREWOLF Reeeal slow, Maa-aaarty- 
INT.  MARTY, CU 
He's reaching desperately into the duct and staring at the approaching WEREWOLF. 
INT.  IN THE HEATING DUCT, ECU 
MARTY'S fingers brush the bullet once... again... seize it.

STAUFFENBERG Hitler's   own Reserve Army, using Hitler's   own plan and under our command,   would automatically seize power in   Berlin... 
GOERDELER (catching on) While we put a new government in place. 
STAUFFENBERG Precisely. It will seem as though we're fighting for Hitler Government, not against it. 
GOERDELER But only if Hitler's dead. 
All eyes turn to Goerdeler. Here we go. 
GOERDELER (CONT'D) That is what you're saying, isn't it? The central solution. 
GOERDELER (CONT'D) How else will you make people believe the SS is trying to seize power? 
STAUFFENBERG I'm afraid it's the only way. 
GOERDELER I'm disappointed in you, Colonel. I thought a man of your background would appreciate a more- 
STAUFFENBERG I'm a soldier first, an aristocrat second. 
GOERDELER Yes, but- 
STAUFFENBERG And you're neither, Doctor. Now if you want to be Chancellor, you'll do as you're told. 
A moment of tension. Humiliated, Goerdeler nods. But he won't ever forget this... 
BECK (to Tresckow) Can this plan be made to work? 
TRESCKOW Rewriting the order is one thing - distributing it is another. A bomb can be disarmed, recovered if it fails. In this case we'd be willfully circulating written evidence of high treason. (thinks) It's the best idea we've heard yet. 
OLBRICHT There is one... small problem. 
TRESCKOW (realizing) Fromm... 
GOERDELER Who is Fromm? 
TRESCKOW Commander of the Home Army. Olbricht can put the reserve troops on alert, but only Fromm can actually initiate Valkyrie. 
BECK Can we get to him? 
OLBRICHT He's a careerist pig. 
STAUFFENBERG But one who's gone as high as he can go in Hitler's Army. It's no secret he's not happy about it. 
TRESCKOW Perhaps if we offered him a key position in the new regime he could be made to see the light. 
BECK We don't seem to have a choice. Without Fromm there is no Valkyrie. (to Olbricht and Stauffenberg) Get him. 
We end on Goerdeler, a look of concern on his face. 
31   INT. WAR MINISTRY - WAITING ROOM - DAY                    31 
TITLES: REICH WAR MINISTRY - OFFICE OF GENERAL FRIEDRICH FROMM. 
MUTED SHOUTS from O.S. Someone is getting reamed. Fromm's adjutant, LIEUTENANT FRANZ HERBER - a young, dedicated soldier - sits at his desk, trying to ignore the screaming from the other room in between stolen glances at... 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL: Stauffenberg and Olbricht waiting patiently, sitting across from: 
MAJOR JOHN VON FREYEND, a dutiful Nazi whose face we immediately don't like. He smiles coldly, taking pleasure in the shouting O.S. He stares at Stauffenberg, studying him, making us nervous. 
Fromm's door finally opens and A BIGGER THAN LIFE NAZI storms out. 
TITLES: FIELD MARSHAL WILHELM KEITEL - HITLER'S CHIEF OF STAFF. 
Freyend stands, holding Keitel's hat and coat for him. A perfect toady. 
KEITEL You're a woman, Fromm. And a fat one at that. I'd have you sent to the front if I didn't think you'd surrender just to be Montgomery's whore. 
Keitel storms out, leaving a pall. Freyend gives Stauffenberg a last once-over and follows. Beat: 
HERBER The... General will see you now. 
32   INT. WAR MINISTRY - FROMM'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS           32 
Stauffenberg and Olbricht step inside to find:

FRANK You know what, you go ahead, don't worry about it, we'll think of something. A couple of ideas just came to me. 
BUDDY Like what? 
43 EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 43 
As Bush starts out the open door, he nearly bumps into Buddy's wife, Kathryn, and MATTIE DARROW. Mattie is carrying Kathryn and Buddy's baby boy. Frank sees Mattie and flicks his hair back nervously and quickly brushes his teeth with his finger as.. .Bush gives Mattie a glance and tries to be invisible. 
MATTIE Felix?! Feigning deafness, Bush walks on. Sensing something, Kathryn takes the baby so Mattie can go after him. 
MATTIE Felix! Say hello to me! Frank, eyes wide with surprise, mouths, "Felix?". Bush's shoulder hunch then fall as he turns. He looks into her, taking everything in. When he speaks his eyes and voice are soft. 
BUSH Hey Mattie. Buddy comes out, surprised to see Mattie and Bush together. Frank walks up behind him and scowls. Kathryn steers them back inside to give Mattie privacy. 
BUSH Heard you moved off. 
MATTIE I've been back a while. 
BUSH 
(LOOKING AWAY) Well. 
MATTIE How are you? 
BUSH You look like you always did. He abruptly rips himself away and is gone. 
44 INT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 44 
Buddy and Frank are peeking out the window. They see Mattie standing alone as Bush walks away. 
FRANK How would she know him? 
KATHRYN (O.S.) It's none of our business. 
FRANK So? We got to know. Kathryn shakes her head and goes back outside. FRANK has another look at Mattie then lets the curtain fall back. 
FRANK See the size of that thing? 
BUDDY What? 
FRANK What do you mean, what? Goddamn ball of money! He wants a party with pink balloons on his ears, we're gonna give it to him. 
BUDDY But.. 
FRANK I sold 26 of the ugliest cars ever made one December, in Chicago, with wind blowing so hard up my ass I was farting snow flakes in July so don't tell me we can't do this. 
BUDDY But.. 
FRANK That's the last "but" I want to hear out of you. You're a salesman now, sell! 
FRANK (looking out again) She called him Felix. 
45 EXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY 45 
Kathryn rocks the baby in a carriage. Mattie is beside her. 
MATTIE A thousand years ago he was the most interesting man I'd ever met.

206   INT. ON STAGE - NIGHT                                          206 Clive, the professional, stands holding the envelope.         He glances off after Rachel, mystified. 
207   INT. STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                                 207 A cluster of people   surround Rachel, comforting her. Frank comes up. He    does not try to force his way through to Rachel. People    begin to move away, the cluster thins. Two stars move off   toward the back of the stage. STAR #1 I always said she was nuts.    I've always said that. Clive Healy comes up. CLIVE Is she all right? He is assured that she is.       Clive goes out to his seat 
in the audience. As the people move off, Rachel becomes clearly visible to Frank. Tony is standing next to her, but another man has his arm around Rachel, comforting her. Rachel's face is tear-stained and she dabs at it with a handkerchief. She is recovering fast. Past her fear, she is now very embarrassed. Her voice is strong. 
RACHEL Christ, what an idiot I am. Jesus. What the hell's the matter with me? Frank moves up closer, and exchanges looks with Tony, who is confused by Rachel's behavior. Rachel turns toward Frank and, in so doing, brings the man comforting her around to face Frank. It is Reardon. RACHEL Farmer, you've made me a raving lunatic. Frank barely hears Rachel, so struck is he   by Reardon's presence. Frank looks around them quickly    for Portman. Rachel looks at Frank with irritation and   turns back toward the Green Room. A production aide    signals Reardon. REARDON (to Rachel) I have to go back out.   Are you okay? RACHEL Thank you for your help, John. I'm fine. Rachel walks off toward the Green Room with Tony. Reardon starts to walk out toward the stage. Frank stops him. Reardon is irritated. FRANK Where's Portman? REARDON Who? FRANK Portman. REARDON (breaking away) Never heard of him. Reardon walks out on stage. Frank is left standing alone. All the weariness comes back, all his senses start to hum. Frank looks around, then moves off toward the Green Room. 
208   INT. GREEN ROOM - NIGHT                                        208 Rachel sits at a makeup table.   Skip Thomas approaches, clipboard in hand. SKIP Rachel, I'm sorry, but if you're going to be in your seat for the Best Actress award, you've got to do it now. RACHEL Skip, I'm moving as fast as I can. For chrissake, go twitch somewhere else. 
Skip backs off.   Spector and Frank join the group. SPECTOR Honey, everything's fine. No one noticed anything. Everybody in this building is ready to jump out of their skin from nerves. RACHEL Bullshit, you saw me. Farmer's made me a raving lunatic -- FRANK Something's going on you should know about -- SPECTOR You're making her crazy.   You're making us all crazy. FRANK Rachel, I know who it is. He's here tonight. I think he's... RACHEL Shut up... This is the last straw. She throws down the powder and stands up fast, makeup and purse flying. The powder com- pact bursts over the cross lying on the table. Everyone in the Green Room looks at her. RACHEL (hissing at him) Shut up, you maniac! You never stop. Now you've made an ass of me in front of a billion people. And you won't quit. They stare at each other and everyone else stares at them. 
Rachel walks swiftly out the door of the Green Room. Frank sits for a moment, then stands up. The bodyguard follows his charge to the door. He whispers hurriedly at Tony as they leave. FRANK Tony, it's Portman.   Remember?   The guy from Miami... Spector grabs Tony's sleeve, pulling him back. SPECTOR After tonight, you're back in charge. TONY What? SPECTOR He knows nothing about show business. Tony squares off with Spector. TONY You are an asshole. 
209   INT. ONSTAGE - NIGHT                                     209 Reardon is just introducing TOM WINSTON, the actor who will announce the Best Actress award. BEST ACTRESS INTRO (TOTAL 1 MINUTE) (Reardon back on stage to applause, Reardon linking material (maybe gags.) Reardon intros Winston. Play on Winston to applause.) 
210   INT. MAIN AUDITORIUM - AISLE                             210 REARDON Presenting the Best Actress award, we have the man who last year received the top honor an actor can achieve for his performance in "South Of Waco". Ladies and gentlemen, Tom Winston! APPLAUSE Frank watches, his eyes scanning, searching the vast theatre, squinting as he tries to see beyond the glare of the klieg lights and the cameras. WINSTON Thank you, John, thank you, Academy. 
It brings back some great memories to be standing here again. Last year I figured something out. While it is a great honor to be nominated, actually winning caps the evening very pleasantly. 
LAUGHTER WINSTON on stage, speaking and then listing the nominees. FRANK'S POV - RACHEL, DEVANEY AND SPECTOR in their seats, up the aisle toward the back of the theatre, high into the gloom of the balcony. ANGLE ON STAGE WINSTON Tonight we give this award not to the best actress, but to the best performance by one of five exquisitely talented artists... FRANK'S FACE - searching. TV CAMERA - focused on the audience.    Its red light goes on. ON SCREEN Rachel's face, expectant, nervous on the screen. FRANK'S POV - THE PATH Rachel would have to take to the stage, the steps to the stage, the faces of the ushers near the stage, the conductor, ready to play theme music. WINSTON (O.S.) ...And the nominees for best performance by an actress in a leading role are -- Constance Simpson for Hot and Cold... BACK TO SCENE APPLAUSE. Frank slips through the curtained doorway that leads to the backstage. WINSTON (O.S.) ...Ellen Pearson for Maybe Soon... More APPLAUSE. 
211   INT. BACKSTAGE - STAGE RIGHT WINGS - NIGHT                211 Frank comes up swiftly. He stops behind a curtain, six feet from the path the winner will take. Tony is there. Frank speaks to him and, as he does, he puts a hand on Tony's arm. They both look across the stage, past Winston into the wings on the other side. FRANK'S POV In the wings of the opposite side of the stage, half hidden by a curtain, a TV cameraman is hoisting his lightweight portable camera onto his shoulder. His back is to us.

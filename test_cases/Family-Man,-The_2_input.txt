LASSITER You suddenly having trouble getting dates? 
JACK Not by a long shot. 
LASSITER Then leave it in the past. Old flames are like old tax returns.  You keep `em in the file cabinet for three years and then you cut `em loose. 
Jack shoots Adelle a satisfied smile, crumpling up Kate's message and tossing a perfect hook into a N.Y. Knicks hoop. 
JACK (to Adelle) I'll leave from the office tomorrow afternoon.  Call the group.  Schedule an emergency strategy session for noon. 
ADELLE That'll be a nice little holiday treat. 
15	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT 
A single light remains on in the building. 
16	INT. JACK'S OFFICE - SAME TIME 
Jack is alone in the office working on his computer, checking spreadsheets on a large flat screen monitor. 
Jack leans back in his chair rubbing his eyes.  He checks his watch.  It's past eleven.  He gets up, goes to the window, sees the city in all its Christmas glory, then he see it... 
...the message from Kate, crumpled in the trashcan...then turns back to the window, gazing out at the night... 
17	INT. LASSITER BUILDING - NIGHT 
Jack comes out of the elevator, walking past the lobby desk where FRANK, a security guard, sits watching the monitors. 
FRANK Mr. Campbell.  Why didn't you call down, I would've had Joe get your ride. 
Jack looks outside the front door to the snowy, quiet street. 
JACK I'm thinking I might walk tonight, Frank. 
FRANK Nice night for it.  I'll have Louis send your car home. 
A nod from Jack. 
FRANK (CONT'D) Merry Christmas to you, sir... 
JACK Thanks.  To you too... 
Jack puts on a pair of soft leather gloves and heads out into the crisp night air... 
18	EXT. LASSITER BUILDING - CONTINOUS 
Jack emerges from the building, walking across the large plaza, past the fountain...snow begins to fall... 
19	EXT. MANHATTAN STREET - A LITTLE LATER 
Jack's walking down the nearly empty street, snow falling down on him, a bounce in his step, looking at the windows of the closed shops along the way. 
He gets to the end of the block spots the Wong Brothers' 24 Hour Deli across the street... 
He heads toward it... 
20	INT. WONG BROTHERS' DELI - SECONDS LATER 
Jack walks into the brightly lit deli... 
SAM WONG, 20s, is with his 80-year-old GRANDFATHER behind the counter.  There's a NERDY COLLEGE KID at the salad bar, a drunken DEPARTMENT STORE SANTA at the liquor display, a WOMAN with a BABY in an aisle and... 
...a BLACK MAN, 30s, with a dollar sign and the name "CASH" tattooed on his arm, stands in front of the coffee machine... 
CASH Oh yeah...yeah, yee-ah!  She's a certified winner...paper- thin but good as gold... 
Jack notices Cash talking to himself, seemingly crazy. 
Jack approaches Sam Wong at the counter. 
JACK Egg nog? 
SAM WONG (pointing) Dairy case.  Five dollar. 
CASH (in the b.g., to Sam Wong) Y'all do the lotto here...? `Cause I got me a winner...I know, I know, Lotto keeps the black man down... but not me... 
Jack grabs a carton of egg nog, then notices Cash handing Sam Wong his ticket.  Jack heads back toward the counter... 
CASH (CONT'D) ...06...14...18...48...right there.  Four numbers...that's two hundred and thirty eight dollar... (a smile) Merry Christmas and shit... 
SAM WONG (barely looking at ticket) Ticket bad.  You draw in lines with pencil. 
CASH What're you talkin' about? 
SAM WONG (throwing the ticket back) You draw lines with pencil!  I know about this! 
The woman with the baby looks over...the college kid looks up, nervous...the drunken Santa, bottle of bourbon in hand, starts to walk by Jack...Jack instinctively puts an arm out, holding the Santa back... 
CASH What!?  Look at the ticket...! 
SAM WONG Get out, I call 911. 
The Santa looks at Jack, confused. 
CASH You're lookin' at me, you're not even lookin' at the ticket! 
The woman with the baby puts a loaf of bread back on the shelf, starts nervously inching toward the door. 
SAM WONG You leave now.  Take ticket somewhere else. (calling out) Next customer in line...! 
CASH You first generation, xenophobic, money-theistic, hot pastrami sandwich making... 
SAM WONG (screaming) Get out! 
Just watching...Cash shoves the ticket in Sam Wong's face... 
CASH LOOK AT THE GODDAMN TICKET!! 
A moment of decision for Jack.  Then... 
JACK (carefully) Let me see that ticket.

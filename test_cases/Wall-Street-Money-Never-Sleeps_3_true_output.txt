GORDON GEKKO Just be happy I'm on your team. 
(AND THEN) Get him into a bad position and watch him chase it. 
JACOB What bad position? 
GORDON GEKKO What have I been saying all along, Kid? 
JACOB Financials. 
GORDON GEKKO They're a death trap -- mark my words. 
INT. THE LOCUST FUND/JACOB'S OFFICE - DAY 
As Jacob takes in his new view... it's spectacular. 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) But he won't fall for a brokerage or bank play this late in the game. Everyone knows they're poison. 
AND TIME LAPSE As the office grows furniture... a plasma on the wall... a computer on the desk... 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) Sell him on insurance. There's a case to be made for those stocks... ill- fated as they may be. ... books on the shelves... pictures on the walls... a couch and table... a paper shredder and waste baskets... 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) But take your time... make him think you've been doing your due diligence. Find Jacob at his desk... working away at his computer... it's late at night. 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) Make it look like you're working your ass off to find him this genius trade... come in early, leave late and don't bring up the idea for at least a few weeks. And Jacob finally gets up from his desk... goes to the window... looking across midtown Manhattan... 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) And then Jacob... ... eyes pasted on a building made of glass and steel... a building he once called home... 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... sell him hard... then watch him bite... then watch him chase... ... KZI Investments. 
GORDON GEKKO (V.O.) (CONT'D) ... then watch him come undone. 
EXT. 533 THIRD AVENUE - DAY 
Holding his suitcase, Jacob emerges from the elevator and heads for a waiting town car. Jacob sees Diego... 
JACOB Bring it. Diego smiles... loves this new one... 
DIEGO What's the most dangerous question on Wall Street? 
JACOB Tell me. 
DIEGO "How are you?" And Jacob agrees whole-heartedly as he heads on his way. 
EXT. WASHINGTON DC - MORNING 
As the sun rises over our nation's capital. 
EXT. ROCK CREEK PARK - MORNING 
Winnie and Jacob jog the park through the humid July haze. It's very early. And Jacob stops jogging. Catches his breath. She keeps running. 
JACOB Why are you with me? She stops and turns back to him. 
WINNIE What? 
JACOB You hate finance. You hate Wall Street. Why are you with me? Winnie nods. It's a valid question. And she thinks about it for a moment, then... 
WINNIE Repetition compulsion. 
JACOB Huh? 
WINNIE It's Freud. 
JACOB And what does it mean, psych major? 
WINNIE Well, it's when people repeat the same dysfunctional relationships from childhood in their adult life in hopes of trying to master them. 
JACOB Like when children of alcoholics fall in love with alcoholics. 
WINNIE Yeah. He turns away... upset. 
JACOB That's great, Winnie. 
WINNIE Jacob, that might be why I was initially attracted to you... but it's not why I love you. She moves to him.

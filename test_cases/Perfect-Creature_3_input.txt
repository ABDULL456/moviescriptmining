20A INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, CHILDS BEDROOM - CONTINUING         20A 
Lilly approaches a room and we see inside it. It is empty apart from a stripped bed and some boxes. 
Lilly flips the lid on one of the boxes. She picks up a toy; a pink fairy princess with wings, the paint on its face worn. 
Lilly winds a key and the wings of the doll flutter, accompanied by the whining sound of the internal mechanics. 
We see Lilly's face as she stares at the doll. Emotion fights to claw its way out from under her skin, but she doesn't let it. 
Then in the distance we hear a child's cries. It almost sounds like memories wafting through the air, but the stamping of feet from the apartment above makes it plain that the noises come from there; the sound of children playing.

21 INT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT                     21 
Lilly enters her bedroom. The place is a mess. She sits on the bed. She picks up a framed photo which sits on a sideboard next to the bed. It shows Lilly, a man - Lilly's age - and a child of 5 years who looks a lot like Lilly. She stares at the child. We hear the sound of rain pounding against the window of the bedroom. 
22 EXT: LILLY'S APARTMENT, BEDROOM - NIGHT                     22 
Pull out to reveal the exterior window. We can see through the window into Lilly's apartment again, see Lilly lying down, hugging the photo. The rain has become a light mist. 
23 EXT: JAMESTOWN SLUM, STREET - NIGHT                         23 
We are close on a poster. It shows a perfect face, serenely beaming out; it could be Silus or Augustus, except this man is dressed in religious regalia, like a priest. The poster says "The Brotherhood loves you. You are divine." We begin to crane off the poster which is revealed to be stuck on a lamp post. The street is seething, the slums of Jamestown. 
A young boy, perhaps seven; spiked up hair, face covered in grime, grime from dragging himself up in this hellish place. He carries a bag filled with the detritus he's picked from the rubbish bins of the rich. He wears a distinctive red t-shirt that is several sizes too big. He moves along the street, avoiding a disinterested passersby. As he passes an alley he hears something. An animal-like growl. He stops. 
Down the alley he can see two figures. One is a male. He is clutching another clothed figure; female. 
KID Hey?! Hey! 
At that instant the man turns to the boy. There, half seen in the slick shadows, the most piercing eyes, a bloody mouth, with fangs, hissing. The creature drops the woman and scales the sheer wall of the alleyway; clutching various handholds, up four flights, then gone. 
The kid, frightened, now makes to run off but bangs into a passerby. The man grabs the kid roughly. 
MAN IN THE STREET Where are you going in such a hurry my little ruffian? Pilfering by the look of you? 
The kid struggles and the Man now sees the shape of the woman in the alleyway, slumped to the ground. 
MAN IN THE STREET (continuing) What's going on here? What'd you do to her? 
KID Don't, I didn't do nothing. It was a Brother. It was a Brother did it. 
The man moves forward, dragging the kid. And he sees the woman there, deathly white in the alley. Dead eyes staring. 
MAN IN THE STREET Oh dear god...

24 INT: NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - DAY                           24 
We track past a sign that says "Museum of Spiritual Selection and Alchemistry." In the distance we can see a group of people in the hazy light. 
Cut to 
Augustus - the man we saw with Silus earlier - sitting on a chair surrounded by various objects. At his feet are a gaggle of school children, aged around ten; affluent looking, human. Augustus points to a strange, ancient looking glass apparatus. 
AUGUSTUS 300 years ago, with these simple instruments, the alchemist Guiseppi De Angelo discovered what we today call genetic science. 
AUGUSTUS (continuing) He deciphered that the Brothers were a new race of beings, sent by god, to serve and protect you. 
We see the faces of the children, rapt. 
AUGUSTUS (continuing) De Angelo formed the church of the Brotherhood. He was a great great man, but there were others, bad men, who took what De Angelo had discovered and experimented without concern for the results. The science of genetics and all its power has been banned ever since. Who can tell me what came from these bad experiments? 
One child puts his hand up. Behind the child, in the distance, Augustus now sees Silus approaching; Silus obviously wants to talk to Augustus. Augustus points to the child while looking at Silus. 
AUGUSTUS (continuing) Yes. 
CHILD All the bad things. Like bad germs and flu.

She sniffs the air. She is suddenly afraid. She turns off the light illuminating the back yard. Walter runs back and forth in the distance. She turns the light back on again. Chris' reflection is now behind hers. He looks savage; covered in blood. Georgina screams and runs out the back door. 
Chris heads to the door, but sees his phone on the dining room table. He goes for it. 
INT. DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Chris runs through the dining room and finds his cell phone on the dining room table. 
Chris picks up his phone and presses the power button. The loading screen comes up. 
Chris grunts with frustration as he hears a creak behind him. It's Missy, now in the kitchen doorway behind him holding her teacup and spoon. She begins clinking her tea cup... 
TING... 
Chris knocks the cup out of her hand spraying hot water on her chest and face. She screams. 
The cat bounds off the dining room table at Chris' face. Chris punches it out of the air. This has given Missy enough time to grab a knife. She lunges at Chris screaming psychotically. Chris can't pin her down. She slices his hands. Chris grabs the tea pot and cracks her in the head with it. She falls. He hits her one more time. Done. 
The cat slinks out an open window. 
INT. FOYER - CONTINUOUS 
Chris runs towards the front door. Before he can open it, he hears a footsteps running upstairs from the basement followed bloodcurdling scream from back in the kitchen: 
JEREMY (O.C.) Ahhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!! 
Jeremy bursts though the dining room and pounces on Chris' back. The two roll around. 
Chris throws his elbow back at Jeremy who blocks it and uses it to put Chris in a choke hold from behind. Chris slams the back of his head into Jeremy's face. He does it again, and again, and again. Jeremy squeezes tighter. 
Chris, about to pass out, reaches into Jeremy's pocket and pulls out his keys. He scrapes them deep into Jeremy's eye. Jeremy screams in pain and Chris wriggles out of his grasp tripping him with an improvised Judo throw. Jeremy lunges at Chris again but slips on his own blood banging the back of his head on the coffee table. He's out. 
EXT. FRONT YARD - NIGHT 
Chris begins to run but then sees the beige sports car we recognize from the opening scene. He looks at Jeremy downed in the doorway and then at the keys in his hand. 
Moments later... 
INT. SPORTS CAR - NIGHT 
Chris is in the driver's seat. The tubular metal helmet sits next to him in the passengers seat. His phone finally turns on. There is a very small amount of batteries. He turns the ignition. The English to French tutorial comes on. 
TUTORIAL I seem to have misplaced my passport. Je crois avoi egare mon passeport. 
Chris peels off, driving fast through the field into the night. He dials 911. 
911 OPERATOR 911 emergency, I'm at the home of Dean and Missy Armitage-- 
Chris looks in the rearview mirror as the house gets smaller behind him. All of a sudden, BAM! The car slams into and over Georgina, who, in the night, seems to come out of nowhere. The phone falls. 
CHRIS Ahhhh! 
TUTORIAL Can you direct me to the nearest hospital? Pouvez-vous me diriger vers I'hopital le plus proche? 
He drives on a few more seconds on a flat tire but then stops the car. Chris breathes heavy. 
CHRIS (TO HIMSELF) No... no... Don't do it... Just get the fuck gotta here... Just go! Just... Fuck! 
Chris puts the car in reverse and drives backwards beside the motionless bloody heap that is Georgina. 
TUTORIAL Where is the nearest train station? Ou est la gare la plus proche? 
He looks back at the house which is now filling with smoke. 
Chris quickly gets out of the car and lifts what's left of Georgina's mangled unconscious body into the passenger's seat of the car. He shuts the door and gets in the driver's seat. He floors it. 
After a moment of driving, Georgina's eyes open and she rises. The wig slides off her head revealing an old surgical scar around the top of her head. Chris hasn't noticed her yet. He reaches for his phone. 
TUTORIAL (CONT'D) Can you please call the police? Pouvez-vous s'il vous plait appelez la police? 
Annoyed, Chris turns off the sound system just before Georgina grabs his face and scratches it. 
GEORGINA Ahhhhh!!

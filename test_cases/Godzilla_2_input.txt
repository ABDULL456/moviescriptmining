Raymond considers this. Finally... 
RAYMOND I am a patriot. I love my country. Can you understand that? 
NICK Sure. 
RAYMOND It is my job to protect my country. Sometimes I must even protect it from itself. From mistakes we have made. Mistakes that we do not want the world to know about. 
NICK Your talking about the nuclear testing in the Pacific. 
RAYMOND Yes. This testing done by my country left a terrible mess. We are here to clean it up. 
129  EXT. WAREHOUSE - ANIMAL - SAME - RAIN - AFTERNOON          129 
Moving down alongside the building, Animal walks down the side alley. He climbs up onto a garbage hamper and peers into a cracked opened window. 
ANIMAL'S P.O.V. - WAREHOUSE 
Animal sees Nick and Raymond with all the hardware. Several of the men are repainting the vehicles to resemble those of the US Army. 
130  INT. WAREHOUSE - SAME                                      130 
Nick walks past the myriad of warfare tools. Jean-Claude turns from the radios. 
JEAN-CLAUDE They will set the trap at thirty minutes to ten. 
RAYMOND That is when we will go in. 
Raymond leads Nick over to a large map. 
RAYMOND We know how to get into the city. We just do not know where to start looking. 
Nick moves closer to the map, putting his finger on the Flat Iron square subway station. 
NICK Here. 23rd street subway station. Where we first found the fish. With a little luck, this will lead us right to it. 
RAYMOND So you're in? 
NICK Are you kidding? I always wanted to join the French Foreign Legion. 
CUT TO: 
131  INT. LUCY'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATER - LATE AFTERNOON    131 
Animal quickly climbs the stairs. People are everywhere. He has to step over them to get to his apartment. AS he opens the door to his apartment he SEES... 
132  INT. APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS - LATE AFTERNOON               132 
Filled with people, Lucy is serving coffee. She smiles at Animal as he enters. 
ANIMAL Who the hell are all these people? 
LUCY What? I just couldn't just let them sleep in the street. 
ANIMAL Where's Audrey? 
LUCY In the bedroom. Crying her eyes out because of you. 
ANIMAL What? 
LUCY All that "you gotta be vicious" stuff you filled her head with. 
ANIMAL Me!? You where the one... 
LUCY Go in there. Talk to her. 
Lucy pushes Animal towards the back bedroom. 
133  INT. BEDROOM - SAME - LATE AFTERNOON                       133 
Audrey has been crying. Crumpled Kleenex wads piled up all around her. A television plays a news broadcast, boasting the headline: THEY CALL HIM GODZILLA! On the t.v. we SEE a news conference with General Anderson addressing some reporters. 
REPORTERS (simultaneously) Can you comment on the nest? How many more of these things will there be? 
GENERAL ANDERSON (filtered) That's why I'm holding this conference. To try and avoid a needless panic. 
Animal enters and watches from the back of the room. 
GENERAL ANDERSON Contrary to some frivolous reports, we have no information to lead us to believe that there are any eggs of the creature in the city. 
AUDREY Stupid idiots! 
ANIMAL You okay? 
AUDREY It's all my fault. What have I done, Animal? What have I become? Look at me. This isn't me. I don't do things like this. 
ANIMAL You made a mistake. 
Suddenly someone exits the bathroom and crosses out of the room. Animal looks at the stranger as he leaves. 
AUDREY Yeah, I just screwed up with the only man who ever really cared about me. 
ANIMAL Didn't you tell me he left for the airport? 
AUDREY Yeah. Why are you asking? 
ANIMAL I just saw him. He's with a bunch of guys who want to sneak into the city tonight. 
Audrey tries to make sense of this. Suddenly she realizes.

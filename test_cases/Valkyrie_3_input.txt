DOCTOR Perhaps before you see the Colonel we should go to my office and- 
NINA I will see my husband now. 
The Doctor wants to argue but Nina's eyes shut him down. He opens the door and they enter to find: 
16   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - CONTINUOUS                         16 
A mass of mummy-like bandages with only small openings around the mouth and one eye. The arms and hands are also wrapped in heavy dressing. No movement but for the rise and fall of the patient's chest. 
Berthold cannot look. Holding back her anguish, Nina bravely turns to the Doctor. "Well?" 
DOCTOR He's been constant with fever but he refuses any pain killers. The right hand has been amputated above the wrist. He's lost the fourth and fifth fingers on the left. We... couldn't save the left eye. 
Berthold covers his face. Nina is a rock. 
NINA His ring. 
DOCTOR I don't- 
NINA He had a ring on his right hand. Where is it? 
DOCTOR I'm sorry... His hand was amputated in the field... I'm afraid- 
NINA Thank you. 
As in: "That will be all." The Doctor leaves. Nina sits beside her husband. She shows him a photo of FOUR BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN - three boys and a girl. 
Stauffenberg tries to speak but can't. His eye begins to tear. 
Nina removes a ring from her finger, placing it on a chain with a cross she takes from around her neck. It is identical to the ring Stauffenberg wore in Africa. 
CLOSE ON: The engraving inside the band - finis- initium [end-beginning]. Nina places the ring and chain on her husband's chest, her hand lingering. She cannot hold the tears back any longer. She stands and turns away, not wanting her husband to see. 
Berthold takes her place. Stauffenberg struggles to speak. Berthold puts an ear to the hole where Stauffenberg's mouth is - making out his question, even if we can't. Berthold debates answering, then: 
BERTHOLD We've lost North Africa. 
CLOSE ON: That one eye staring at us closes. 
17   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAYS LATER                          17 
Stauffenberg's bandages are gone - a black patch covering what had been his left eye. The chain with the cross and ring from Nina hangs around his neck. 
ANOTHER PATIENT lies motionless in the next bed. 
A man's belongings tell you more about him than he ever could. Stauffenberg's side of the room is neatly arranged, books of poetry and philosophy are well worn. Beside them are his own writings - the print meticulous and flowing. Up to a certain date. After that a new, child-like hand has taken over. 
A family photograph shows the Stauffenberg's of another generation - wealthy aristocrats from a bygone era. He is a teenager in this photo and smiling broadly. A smile he left in Africa. 
Stauffenberg's three fingers push a cotton ball under his eyepatch to dab the empty socket. Then he goes to button his shirt. Holding his collar in his teeth, he tries to do the buttons with the use of only three fingers on his left hand. It is heartbreaking to watch. 
He is about to give up when he notices a figure looming in the doorway. General Olbricht. He winces at the sight of Stauffenberg's deformities. 
STAUFFENBERG I don't know what I ever did with ten. 
Olbricht manages a smile, he moves to speak, but Stauffenberg beats him to it. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) I'm wanted in Berlin. 
Olbricht nods. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) Are you asking as a member of the High Command? 
Olbricht contemplates his answer. He carefully closes the door behind him, nervously glancing at the patient in the next bed. 
STAUFFENBERG (CONT'D) You can speak openly, General. He died just before you came in. 
Awkward moment. Finally: 
OLBRICHT We could use your help. 
STAUFFENBERG I'm a field officer. 
Olbricht steps closer, speaking openly now. 
OLBRICHT This war can't be won in the field.

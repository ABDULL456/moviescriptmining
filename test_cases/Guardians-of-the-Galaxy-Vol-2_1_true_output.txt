ROCKET Awesome. We'll really be able to jack up our prices if we're two- time-galaxy savers. 
QUILL I seriously can't believe that is where your mind goes. 
ROCKET It was just a random thought, man! I thought we were friends! (MORE) 
ROCKET (CONT'D) Of course I care about the planets, and the buildings, and all of the animals on the planets. 
QUILL And the people. 
ROCKET Meh. 
Mantis GIGGLES. 
MANTIS The crabby puppy is so cute he makes me want to die! 
DRAX Your suicidal thoughts sadden me, but your wish will likely come true. 
I/E. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
MEANWHILE, Kraglin is mellowly hanging out, eating some soup and listening to "WHAM BAM" BY SILVER as he sees something out in the distance of space. He looks a bit closer. 
SOVEREIGN OMNICRAFT ARE POPPING THROUGH JUMP POINTS ABOVE EGO'S PLANET. 
EXT. AYESHA'S SPACECRAFT - OUTER SPACE 
AYESHA is remotely piloting one of the ships.   She looks determined and angry on the vid-screen. 
And, one by one, Sovereign OMNICRAFT POP IN all around her, until there is a large fleet. 
INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY 
Ayesha, in full pilot gear, yells into her comm. 
AYESHA Pilots, release envoy units! 
EXT. AYESHA'S SPACECRAFT - OUTER SPACE 
Smaller, more nimble robotic ENVOYS, like big pods with blasters for arms - detach from the front of every Omnicraft. 
AYESHA Our sensors detect the batteries are below the surface of the planet. 
INT. SOVEREIGN PILOT BAY - DAY 
AYESHA Dive! 
OVERHEAD SHOT: On the screens in all the pods, the envoys DIVE toward the planet from slightly different directions. 
I/E. QUADRANT FLIGHT DECK - OUTER SPACE 
Kraglin, in shock, watches the massive fleet of envoys diving downward. He grabs the comm. 
KRAGLIN Uhh... Cap'n? 
No answer. 
KRAGLIN (CONT'D) Cap'n? 
INT. LASER DRILL/CRACK IN THE PLANET - SUNRISE 
Yondu doesn't hear the CRACKLING SPEAKER beside him as they maneuver down through the fissure. Quill eyes him. 
YONDU So why'd Ego want you here? 
QUILL He needs my genetic connection to the light to help destroy the universe. He tried to teach me how to control the power. 
YONDU So could you? 
QUILL A little. I made a ball. 
YONDU A ball? 
QUILL I thought as hard as a could, that's all I could come up with. 
YONDU You `thought'? 
Quill nods. 
YONDU (CONT'D) You think when I make this arrow fly I use my head? 
QUILL What do you use? 
They look at each other instead of where they're going, and the CRASH into an overhanging piece of rock. 
The entire side door is RIPPED OFF. 
As the SCREECH through a smaller space and into -- 
INT. PLANET'S HOLLOW/LASER DRILL - DAY 
The Laser Drill DROPS into this enormous open space within the planet. 
The Guardians gather on the side of the ship open to the hollow, gazing out at its stunning beauty, lit by Ego's white glow running throughout it. 
GAMORA Whoa. 
Mantis turns, looking through the portholes on the other side. 
MANTIS There! Thats Ego's core. 
Mantis points at the Self Chamber, down below them.   They twist down towards it. 
GAMORA That ore's thick. Rocket, we're gonna need to use the big laser. 
Rocket nods, FLICKS switches. 
All the small lasers on the sides move through grooves to combine into one huge laser in the center of the ship: the MEGA-LASER. 
MANTIS We must hurry. It will not take Ego long to find us. 
ROCKET Keep it still! 
Quill steadies the craft as best he can beside the Self Chamber. But it's an unwieldy beast, built for power, not precision. 
Rocket powers up the mega-laser and holds tight to the SHUDDERING CONTROLS as it DRILLS, BURNING a HOLE into the protective sheathe. It melts and drips down.

KOWOLSKI'S BAKERY - KITCHEN - DAY \nA news crew shuttles around a GIGANTIC COOKIE. Standing by are the KOWOLSKI BROTHERS, GUSTOV and VOL, two SHORT, STOCKY, MEN, along with MOTHER KOWOLSKI and other bakery family employees. A \"30 YEAR ANNIVERSARY\" sign hangs in the background. BRUCE NOLAN looks into a make-up mirror, desperately trying to place a large segment of wayward hair. BRUCE Oh, God, no! The hair's wrong. This is a bad sign. (calling out) We really need to get a make-up person?! The segment producer, ALLY LOMAN, steps over. ALLY Not in the budget. And not to                         * worry, you're going to look great in this. She holds out a HAIR NET. BRUCE A hair net? I'm not wearing a hair net. I just did the hair. ALLY (matter of fact) Health code. In the kitchen or around the cookie, you gotta have it. BRUCE (to crew: re hair net) You guy's should tell me this before hand, this is like a huge waste of...moose. Bruce spreads the hair net, bends down out of frame, comes up looking ridiculous and very disgruntled. BRUCE Remind me to swing by an elementary                   * school after this and serve lunch. Ally laughs. \nBRUCE Hey, that's a good line, but you need more resonance. From the diaphragm. (newscaster voice) That's the way the cookie crumbles. GRACE Oh, say it again. BRUCE (bigger) That's the way the cookie crumbles. GRACE (sweet, southern groupie) Oh, I just love on-air personalities. BRUCE (newscaster voice) Well then, let me take these clothes off and slip into my hair net. Grace laughs, Bruce joins in as they disappear into the bedroom.

Bruce looks at his watch, he's screwed. A person is CARRIED BY ON A STRETCHER, Bruce is oblivious. BRUCE This is just my luck. Bruce's BEEPER sounds.      He checks it. BRUCE. The meeting's starting, perfect... (thinks) Screw it. He looks to the right of the car in front of him, then peels off onto the shoulder, passing tons of cars. BRUCE (laughs) Catch you later, lemmings 1 It's kill or be killed, only the strong survive, no guts, no glory1 SFX: SIREN Bruce pulls over, fumes. BRUCE (looking heavenward) Thank you. EXT. PARKING LOT - DAY Bruce screeches into a space, races out of the car, bumping over a trash can, goes back to pick it up, sees a HOMELESS MAN who sits peacefully next to a paint bucket and sign boards. The various \"warnings\" change daily. Today's SIGN reads: R EWE BLIND? Bruce looks at the sign quizzically for a beat, then continues on. INT. NEWSROOM - DAY Bruce rushes through the newsroom, rounds a corner and runs right into BOBBY, the endlessly yammering PASTRY CART GUY. \nBOBBY Bruce the goose! Morning, Buddy. Don't even move, I got somethin' special today. My mom made it just for you. BRUCE Well, that's- Bobby, I gotta go- I'm late... BOBBY (bending down) You like Quiche? He comes back up, proudly presents a slice of quiche. BOBBY You know, contrary to popular belief the quiche was actually invented by the Mayans, then stolen by the French. They shoulda said, \"Hey, that quiche ain't yours, it's Mayan!\" Bobby belts out a laugh. BRUCE Bobby, I can't, I-- BOBBY Just taste it, taste it... Bobby shoves a bite into Bruce's mouth. Bruce feigns liking it with exasperation. BRUCE Mmm, delicious, I really gotta go. BOBBY That's a buck seventy-five. BRUCE Can you get Kelly- Ahh... Bruce tosses the thought, digs into his pocket, fishing for cash. BOBBY (excited) Oh, two o'clock, two o'clock, two-o- five, two-ten... \nBruce glances over, annoyed but freezes at the sight of sexy anchorwoman, SUSAN ORTEGA across the room. BOBBY Way out of our league, huh? Bruce offers his money to Bobby. BOBBY You know, I saw them editing your cookie piece. \nBRUCE Really? \nBOBBY They must have gotten high or something, cause they was orderin' everything, I had. Hey, how long have you been interested in pastry? 'Cause I've got an aunt who makes baklava twenty layers deep. \nBRUCE (holding money out) Bobby. BOBBY (gets a brilliant idea) Maybe you could do a story on her! Bruce tosses the money on the cart, heads off. BRUCE Keep the change. BOBBY (calling after) I'll give her a call, we'll talk about it later! INT. STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY \nJACK You don't want to be like Evan. Evan's an asshole. BRUCE I can be an asshole. \nJACK No, Bruce.     You can't. Bruce thinks, then flips Jack's sandwich plate over. It scatters on the floor. Jack and Bruce stare at each other for a beat. JACK Are you going to pick that up? BRUCE Yeah, I'm sorry. Bruce bends down, starts picking up Jack's food. BRUCE It's just- this anchor position looming, it's gotten me nuts... He hands the plate to Jack, as sexy anchorwoman SUSAN ORTEGA saunters by. JACK                               BRUCE Hi, Susan.                           Hi, Susan. SUSAN ORTEGA Hi, Jack. Bruce blanches at this obvious snubbing. JACK Look, Bruce. You're a good reporter. You make people laugh. God knows today we can use it. Bruce slumps, he's heard this a thousand times before.              * JACK                                    * (beat) Alright, tell you what. It's the                   * 23rd anniversary of the Maid of the Mist. I want you at Niagara Falls in an hour. BRUCE Maid of the Mist. That's always live. JACK Yep. BRUCE Evan gets the live feeds. \nJACK Well now you and Evan get the live feeds. BRUCE I'm going live. In sweeps. JACK Yes, but watch yourself, Bruce. I've seen your outtakes. Bruce hugs Jack, pressing the sandwich against his chest. BRUCE Yes 1 You will not regret this, Jack. (releases Jack) I will not forget you when I go national. Bruce takes off, Jack looks down, peels the sandwich off his chest. We hear children's joyous SHRIEKS... INT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - DAY \nA COUPLE DOZEN KIDS playing at Grace's self-starter business, a one room day care center filled with children and toys. Grace turns, reacts. GRACE Martin, are you eating the glitter again? ON MARTIN - AN ADORABLE HISPANIC BOY He shakes his head \"no.\" \nGRACE Martin. Open your mouth. Abra su boca. He does. His tongue sparkles with glitter. GRACE Oh, you're not huh? Well, then you've got a bad case of Liberace. Grace's sister, Debbie, enters. She's wearing a nurse's outfit. Her youngest, ZOE, 3, runs over to greet her. ZOE Mommy1 \nGRACE They didn't teach you Spanish in nursing school, did they? DEBBIE Well, it seemed like they were speaking a foreign language sometimes, but no. Problemo? GRACE Martin has decided to explore new food groups. (back to Martin) Martin, this is for art. Like this. She spreads paste on the paper, sprinkles glitter. DEBBIE Is it so wrong to tie them up? GRACE D eb -- Ma rt i n! Martin is busted with the paste spreader stuck in his mouth. Grace snatches it. GRACE Okay, go rinse your mouth with water. Lave su boca. Go. (to Debbie) I swear that kid is going to poop an ornament. DEBBIE (laughs) You're good with them, you know. You should have some of your own. GRACE Don't start... DEBBIE Free milk cow. GRACE Debbie, don't call me that. DEBBIE If the moo fits. The phone RINGS. \nTHE LIVE FEED IN THE CAMERA TRUCK AT THE FALLS \nSome of the CREW MEMBERS watch the feed. \nON TV \nPete Fineman is reporting. PETE FINEMAN ...but because of the fast response by our local fire fighters, the toxic chemicals were cleaned up without incident. Susan. The female co-anchor, SUSAN ORTEGA: SUSAN Bruce Nolan is standing by at Niagara Falls with a report on the Maid of the Mist sightseeing boat, but before we go live to Bruce, we have an announcement to make. As everyone knows, after 33 years, our beloved Pete Fineman is retiring. Pete smiles a proud, heart-felt smile. SUSAN Pete's shoes are virtually impossible to fill, but the show must go on. And we could think of no one better than our very own Evan Baxter. ON BRUCE \nListening to the feed. His FACE GOES WHITE.      He stands in shock. Evan is seated next to Susan. \nSUSAN Congratulations, Evan. Looks like we'll be sitting side by side from now on. EVAN Thanks, Susan. I ' m thrilled and honored. Like you said, no one can replace the great Pete Fineman, but I'll do my best. I have to say I am so proud to be a part of our local community. Of Buffalo. I think a great city is a lot like a great recipe really. Put in some hard working citizens, add some care givers, maybe a few nuts... The other news anchors and Evan himself chuckle at \"his\" joke. Bruce listens on the feed, beyond stunned. EVAN (CONT'D) All sprinkled with the strength and love of our good families, that ultimately creates a sweet place to live. Thank you. SUSAN (touched) Wow. That was amazing. And now let's go live to wacky Bruce Nolan out at Niagara Falls. EXT. NIAGARA FALLS - CONTINUOUS Bruce stands like a deer in headlights, drenched, holding the ridiculous umbrella. Ally sig nals Bruce he's on. He stares into camera, numb. INT. SMALL WONDER DAY CARE - SAME TIME The kids are gone. Grace watches the TV with a few other teachers. She's concerned. GRACE Talk honey, talk. INT. STUDIO CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS Jack rushes in, looking at Bruce on the monitor.

SMALL WONDERS CARE - DAY GRACE Please baby, say something... \nEXT. NIAGARA FALLS - CONTINUOUS \nLike popping out of a coma, Bruce surges in. Surprisingly, seems very up and fine. BRUCE Thank you, Susan 1 Bruce Nolan here aboard the Maid of the Mist at Niagara falls. INT. SMALL WONDERS DAY CARE - CONTINUOUS \nGRACE Thank you, God. \nINT. STUDIO CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS JACK (sighs relief) Thank God. Jack pats the Director's shoulder, heads out of the room. \nBRUCE (cont'd) Just what you get for trying to help someone. Bruce gets in, pulls out of the parking lot passing the Homeless Man who sits beaten up holding a scrawled out sign \"LIFE IS. JUST\" BRUCE Get a clue, buddy. INT. BRUCE AND GRACE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Bruce is pacing, holding an ICE PACK to his swollen lip. GRACE Thank God you're alright. BRUCE God, yeah. Let's thank God. Thanks for everything, Lord. I am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan. GRACE Bruce, don't talk like that. BRUCE Oh, don't worry, he's not listening. If he is he doesn't care. Have you seen the news lately? We got gangs, we got drugs, we got corruption. What kind of God lets that happen? Every time we cure a disease he comes up with a new one! (goes into God character) Yeah, is this the lab? Yeah, it's God. They've just come up with a treatment for syphilis down there. I think it's time to release the tainted monkey. Oh, and there's a guy in Ohio who's praying for strength and wisdom, blind him and cut off his legs. GRACE So God is torturing us? BRUCE Think about it, Grace. God is all- powerful . He could fix everything in five minutes if he wanted to. (MORE) \nBRUCE (cont'd) But he doesn't want to. He doesn't like me. Sam starts PEEING ON THE RUG. \nBRUCE Oh, Perfect! (to the dog) But you're aim isn't so good, I'm over herel GRACE Bruce, please. This isn't his fault. BRUCE Of course not. (hushed tone) It's part of the mysterious plan. Grace puts Sam outside. Returns, trying to calm Bruce. GRACE Honey, you're mad right now. It's understandable. And what Evan did was slimy and wrong. But your job doesn't matter to me. You matter to me. You could've really been hurt. I'm just glad you're okay. \nBRUCE Okay? News flash: I'm not okayi And I'm not okay with the fact that you think everything is okay. I'm not okay with a mediocre job. I'm not okay with a mediocre apartment. I'm not okay with a mediocre LIFE! Bruce angrily swipes at the table knocking the photos and the photo albums to floor. GRACE Is that what you have, Bruce? A mediocre life? Well, I'm sorry for being a piece in your mediocre puzzle. BRUCE Terrific. I'm drowning and you throw me a brick! Grace starts to cry. \nBRUCE Perfect! I'll have the worst day of my life with a side order of guilt, please. I-- I don't need this. Bruce grabs his keys and heads out. \nINT. CAR - NIGHT It's RAINING now. Bruce drives, going nowhere in particular. His frustration is turning to desperation. BRUCE Okay, God. You want me to talk to you? Then talk back. Tell me what's going on? What should I do? Give me a sign... Bruce passes a BLINKING YELLOW CAUTION LIGHT, doesn't notice. . . BRUCE I'm right here. Speak to me. A PEDESTRIAN stepping into the crosswalk, steps back out of the way. PEDESTRIAN SLOW DOWN, ASSHOLE! \nThe stairwell door opens up to a LARGE ROOM with a SINGLE DESK at the end of an otherwise empty space. Bruce hears someone tinkering atop a tall ladder extending into a hole in the ceiling. BRUCE Excuse me. Hello. I'm, ah, looking for whoever runs this joint... MAN (O.S.) Be right with y.a, just fixin' a light. Tell me if it's working? CLICK and an INSANELY BRIGHT WHITE LIGHT ILLUMINATES, shining down blinding Bruce. \nBRUCE Yep, seems to be. (wiping his eyes) Kinda bright, though. \nAn electrician, silhouetted in the bright light, descends the ladder. MAN (O.S.) Yeah, it is for most people. They spend their lives in the dark... As he talks he steps down next to Bruce and we see that it is the SAME JANITOR. JANITOR (CONT'D) . . . thinkin' they can hide from me. The two stand, angelically illuminated.    Bruce tries to put everything together. BRUCE Oh, the elevator's broken, huh? JANITOR Yeah, but I'll get around to it. The Janitor CLAPS HIS HANDS TWICE and the light goes off. BRUCE You installed a clapper? JANITOR Nope.   Catchy jingle, though. (sings) CLAP ON. CLAP OFF.    CLAP ON, CLAP OFF. THE CLAPPER. (claps twice) You can't get it out of your head. BRUCE I gotta go. JANITOR Okay, but the boss'11 be right out. The Janitor unzips his uniform, revealing a very nice suit. He extends his hand to Bruce. JANITOR You must be Bruce. I've been expecting you. BRUCE Oh, this is hilarious. So you're the boss and the electrician and the janitor. \nJANITOR Nothin' wrong with rollin' up your sleeves, son. People underestimate the benefits of good 'ol manual labor. There's freedom in it. Happiest people in the world stink like hell at the end of the day. He strolls down the room, takes a seat behind the big desk. JANITOR Your father knew that. He was a damn good welder. Bruce approaches the desk. BRUCE How do you know my father? And how did you get my pager number? JANITOR Oh, I know a lot about you Bruce. Pretty much everything there is to know. Everything you've ever said, done or thought about doin', is right there in that file cabinet. He points out a single drawer file cabinet. BRUCE (sarcastic) Wow, a whole drawer. Just for me? Mind if I take a look? JANITOR It's your life. Bruce pulls the drawer and it FLIES OPEN, DRAGGING HIM THE FULL LENGTH OF THE ROOM -- The Janitor casually pulls a file. JANITOR Now this last entry was a little disturbing. He thumps the file cabinet with his fist and the drawer dramatically sucks closed, DRAGGING BRUCE BACK. The Janitor reads from the file. JANITOR (reads, scanning) Thanks for everything, Lord. (MORE) \nJANITOR (cont'd) I am so honored that my horrible demise is a part of your loving and mysterious plan.. The gloves are off, pal.. Smite me oh mighty smiter. (aside) I'm not much for blaspheming but that one made me laugh. Oh, and let's not forget \"What kind of a God would let this happen? I mean, have you seen then news lately?\" Bruce stands, dazed. \u00b7 BRUCE Who are you? JANITOR I'm the creator of the heavens and the earth. I'm the alpha & omega. The first and the last. BRUCE Sorry, it's not ringing a bell. JANITOR/GOD I'm God, Bruce. BRUCE Oh, you're God. Well that explains everything1 That's how you know everything about me. That's how you got up to the seventh floor so quickly. (placating) Well, it's really nice to meet you. Thanks for the Grand Canyon and, ah, good luck with the apocalypse. Bruce turns to leave, BUT FINDS HIMSELF WALKING RIGHT TOWARD GOD AND HIS DESK. He tries again, and again. BRUCE Okay, I don't know how you're doing that, but I really gotta go. This place is obviously rigged in some way. We're on some freaky hidden camera show. (playing to the \"cameras\") ...for which I will not sign a release, by the way! But you know what, I'd be a little more impressed if you didn't use the cheesy file cabinet illusion. (MORE) \nBRUCE      (cont'd) Everyone with a      brain in their head would know that      the drawer is being \u00b7             fed through the       wall from behind-- Bruce pulls the file cabinet from the wall, sees it has a normal back. BRUCE Okay.     That's good.   That's a good one. Bruce quickly puts his hands behind his back. BRUCE Okay, God. How many fingers am I holding out? Bruce extends three fingers. GOD Three. He quickly pulls one finger in. GOD Two. Bruce begins switching fingers rapidly.      God doesn't miss a beat. GOD Four. Nine. Six. Eight. One... One final attempt, Bruce holds seven fingers. BRUCE Okay, how about now. He quickly pulls in two fingers. GOD Seven. \nEXT. CITY STREETS \nBruce drives, whistling the tune, catches himself, immediately stops whistling. BRUCE Okay, just relax here. I did not meet God and I do not have his powers. (laughs) If that was God, then I'm Mario Andretti. Instantly, Bruce's car PEELS OUT, races through traffic, dodging and passing cars right and left. BRUCE AAAHHHHHHHH!J! \nSuddenly there is a GUY IN A RED PIT CREW SUIT standing before Bruce waving a red flag. Bruce swerves to avoid the man and SCREECHES into a pit stop. Several other red-suited Italian men engulf the car. Bruce watches in amazement as the professional racing team jacks up his car, slaps on HUGE MAG TIRES, gases him up, etc. PAUL NEWMAN leans into the driver's window. PAUL NEWMAN Hey Mario, did you get that box of dressing I sent you? Bruce responds against his will IN PERFECT ITALIAN -- BRUCE (in perfect Italian) Si, dovete venire sopra per il pranzo un certo tempo. (SUBTITLES: Yes, you must come over for dinner some time.) Bruce reacts shocked.   The crew backs off and urges him on in Italian. PIT CREW Vete l Ve tel Bruce's car peels out on it's own, he struggles to control the wheel, finally pulling over to a curb. His car door won't open so he has to crawl out of the driver's window. \nHe rushes onto the sidewalk, backing away from his normal looking Tauras. Not knowing what to do, he slips into a diner. INT. DINER - DAY Bruce quickly walks to a back corner booth. The only other patron is an OLD MAN seated at the counter. BRUCE It isn't real, it isn't real, it isn't real... An older. Sally Kirkland-type WAITRESS, order pad in hand, stands listening to Bruce with a raised eyebrow. BRUCE Oh hi, ah, coffee please. The waitress pours him a cup. \nWAITRESS We've got a special on soup today. \nBRUCE No, that's okay. WAITRESS It's tomato. BRUCE Alright, okay. She heads off.    Bruce sits thinking.   Could it be real? He looks at the SUGAR down at the end of the table, holds out his hand and the SUGAR SLIDES ACROSS THE TABLE RIGHT INTO HIS HAND. The CREAMER slides into his other hand. Bruce is half scared, half thrilled. He pours some cream and sugar into his cup, looks around the table. BRUCE Excuse me I need a spoooo... Bruce chokes up a spoon into his hands, wipes it off with his napkin. BRUCE That's alright, I found one. The Old Man eyes Bruce suspiciously, gets up and moves further down the counter. The Waitress sets down the soup, heads off, then turns back. WAITRESS I lie to my sister. BRUCE What? WAITRESS (becoming emotional) And I'm sleeping with my best friend's husband. I know he's just using me but.. I'm just so tired of being alone. I don't know why I'm telling you all this. Just seems like you'd understand. BRUCE Okay. \nDEBBIE Yeah, she should marry somebody famous, take the focus off. Grace checks her cell phone screen. DEBBIE We would have heard it ring. GRACE I know. It's just that he usually calls during the day. DEBBIE He just needs to blow off some steam, he'll be fine. GRACE I hope so. I've never seen him                        * that mad. An d I lashed back--                        * DEBBIE Wow, you lashed? You never lash. I'm impressed. GRACE I feel bad for him.   He's wanted anchor for so long. Zoe begins pulling groups of items onto the belt. DEBBIE Well, I've been praying to win the lottery for fifteen years, but it's not going to happen. You know, it's not all about money. The CLERK finishes ringing the last item. CLERK That'll be four hundred and twenty- seven, eighty.- DEBBIE What?! Debbie looks in a bag, pulls out a handful of various counter items. Zoe giggles and proudly holds up one of the hundred or so Tic-Tac mint containers. DEBBIE Zoe. (to Clerk) (MORE) \nDEBBIE (cont'd) Hang on, I might need you to un- check a few things. The people in line hem and haw, exasperated. GUY IN LINE Come on, lady. DEBBIE (snaps) Hey, everybody back-off i Zoe laughs, enjoying the commotion. GRACE Listen, I better get back. I want to be there for him. DEBBIE You're a saint, Grace. GRACE What can I say, I love him. And if I know Bruce, he's out there wandering around with the weight of the world on his shoulders. \nCUT T0: \nEXT. CITY STREETS - DUSK Bruce struts down the street the embodiment of confidence. He turns shooting a finger at a fire hydrant, it BLASTS WATER. KIDS run off their front steps, start playing. A PRETTY GIRL IN A DRESS, comes' walking toward him. As she passes he BLOWS A LITTLE AIR OUT OF THE CORNER OF HIS MOUTH and turns to watch her SKIRT FLY UP. BRUCE And he saw that it was good. He spots a    mannequin in a store window display, wearing a cool, casu   al outfit. He closes his eyes. When he opens them, HE'S   WEARING THE COOL NEW OUTFIT and the mannequin is dressed in   his clothes. He checks his reflection. . . better. Bruce rounds the corner, sees the SAME GANG that beat him up, hanging out in the alley. BRUCE B-e-a-utifull \nEXT. ALLEY \nBruce approaches the gang. BRUCE Hey guys, remember me? The gang members turn to Bruce. HOOD #1 Oh look, it's the hero. HOOD #2 Hungry for another can of whoop- ass? HOOD #3 Your stereo sounds great in my car, man. He and a couple other gang members laugh and high-five. BRUCE Look, I don't want to fight you guys. So as soon as you apologize, I'll be on my way. A beat, then the Hoods BURST OUT LAUGHING.         A few circle behind, surrounding Bruce. HOOD #1 Oh, yeah. I'll apologize... The day a monkey climbs out of my butt. BRUCE What a coincidence. That's today. The Hood gets a PAINED LOOK, starts gyrating around, then a MONKEY comes climbing out the back of his baggy pants. The Big Guy looks at Hood #1. BIG GUY Did that come out of your butt, man? Hood #1 faints from shock. BRUCE Now I'm going to have to teach the rest of you guys a lesson. \nBRUCE What if God was one of us. . . Just a slob like one of us... Just a stranger on a bus... Trying to make his way. . . Grace reacts a bit surprised by Bruce's happy tone, she gets up, opens the door and there stands BRUCE, beaming smile, holding a very unique BOUQUET OF FLOWERS. BRUCE (finishing song) ...home. GRACE (re: the flowers) Oh, my God. BRUCE You can call me Bruce. GRACE Where have you been? You're so...happy. BRUCE Who wouldn't be on a night like this? (holding out the flowers) For you. Grace takes the flowers, gives Bruce a kiss, still sizing up his mood. GRACE These are amazing. What are they? BRUCE It's a totally new breed. A cross pollination between tulips and Daisies. I call them Todayzees. GRACE Todayzees? Okay... Grace goes to put them in water. INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS GRACE Bruce, is there something you're not telling me? \nBRUCE Nothing of this world. Why? GRACE What do you mean, why? Last night you weren't exactly happy with life. BRUCE Last night, I was only human. Bruce backs out of the kitchen seductively. INT. LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Bruce breezes through, casually instructs the stereo as he passes. BRUCE CD 4, Track 7. The Stereo illuminates and Barry White music plays. EXT. BALCONY - CONTINUOUS Bruce opens the doors, steps onto the balcony. He surveys the cloudy sky, reaches up with his hand and ERASES THE CLOUDS, LIKE ON A CHALKBOARD. Still not completely satisfied he reaches up toward the moon and makes a LASSOING MOTION, THEN BEGINS TO PULL. CUT TO: OUTER SPACE - BEHIND THE MOON Earth far off in the distance - And with a THUNDEROUS RUMBLE the MOON starts MOVING CLOSER TO EARTH. BACK TO SCENE Bruce adds a finishing touch by adding several stars with points of his finger. Grace joins Bruce on the balcony and is taken aback by the perfectly orchestrated sky. GRACE Wow, it really cleared up. I've never seen the moon that big. Bruce puts his arms around Grace from behind. \nBRUCE We shouldn't waste it. Bruce starts kissing her neck. Grace turns, .they kiss and a METEOR SHOWER lights the sky behind them. The kiss ends. BRUCE Bedroom. GRACE Five minutes. INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nGrace grabs a neglige from the drawer, heads into the bathroom. Bruce enters, adjusts the ambience of the room, BLOWS THE LIGHTS OUT with a quick puff of air, LIGHTS CANDLES with a gesture. His clothes magically fall away. INT. BATHROOM - CONTINUOUS \nGrace slips her neglige on, begins brushing her hair. GRACE I'11 be out in a minute. BRUCE (O.S.)                                * Don't rush yourself.

EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT 
Chuck stands by the edge of the water, which shimmers in the reflected light of the fire.  A wave come in, licks at his toes.  Lifts up a coconut husk, sweeps it gently out.  Chuck watches, gets an idea. 
EXT.  BEACH - NIGHT 
He begins to dig in the sand by the raft.  He grabs the oar and digs faster, making a trench up to where the raft is. 
EXT.  BEACH - MORNING 
The rising tide floods water into the trench.  Chuck rocks the raft back and forth.  It floats!  As the wave recedes, it takes the raft with it.  Chuck has to run beside it. 
CHUCK TRYING TO ESCAPE - MONTAGE 
Over and over, we see Chuck capsize at the reef.  The first time he has a bandage on his leg.  He tries everything -- different rafts, different approaches, but each time the ocean spits him back. 
EXT.  LAGOON - DAY 
Defeated and utterly exhausted, Chuck swims back from his latest failure.  He wades back ashore with the FedEx box and throws it on the ground by the palm tree.  He has tried so hard to escape, so incredibly hard, done everything humanly possible and beyond.  He rips off his life preserver, throws it into the underbrush, then collapses on the beach. 
CHUCK You're too low in the water.  Too damn low. 
Chuck's shoulders begin to shake, as he is racked with deep sobs of despair. 
And then he throws his head back and lets forth, from deep inside himself, a SCREAM of rage and anger and pain.  The Scream pierces the indifferent natural sounds of the island, the rustling of the breeze, the lulling rhythm of the waves. It is powerful, disturbing, primal. 
The breeze picks up.  Behind Chuck, the palm trees begin to sway.  The tide is reaching up toward the beach.  The waves crash louder.  The palm trees sway even more. 
Chuck picks up some wet sand and rubs it on his body. 
CHUCK Dust thou art -- that's for damned sure -- and unto dust shalt thou return. 
A few DROPS OF RAIN begin to fall, splashing on Chuck and sizzling in the fire. 
Chuck looks up:  clouds have obscured the sun.  The wind blows harder.  The rain falls harder, streaking the sand Chuck had rubbed on his body.  STEAM sizzles out of the fire. 
Chuck looks up, disbelieving.  The bottom falls out of the heavens -- monsoon rain, more rain than you have ever seen before.  A long wave rolls up, its frothy fingers reaching for the fire. 
Forget the raft!  Forget despair!  The fire could go out! This is disaster! 
CHUCK Shit! 
He springs into action.  Chuck grabs an empty FedEx box. With his wooden shovel he frantically SCOOPS SOME COALS out of the fire as the rain HISSES and POUNDS at them.  He slides the coals into the FedEx box, grabs some sticks of driftwood and sets off on a run. 
EXT.  WOODS - DAY 
Chuck runs through the woods, slipping and stumbling.  Vines grab at him.  The rain is so thick he can hardly see. 
EXT.  WOODS - MINUTES LATER 
Chuck bursts out of the woods into the lava field.  Smoke pours out of the FedEx box.  The coals are about to burn through! 
EXT.  LAVA FIELD - MOMENTS LATER 
Chuck stumbles up the slippery rocks, dragging the smoking box.  His face is drenched, desperate. 
EXT.  CAVE - DAY - MINUTES LATER 
Chuck tumbles into the cave just as the coals burn through the FedEx box. 
Using the remains of the box, he desperately tries to scoot the coals into a dry spot. 
One by one, THE PRECIOUS COALS GO OUT. 
Dripping water off his hands and face, he pushes a few together with his fingers, ignoring the burns. 
CHUCK Please...please...please... 
He stomps on the driftwood and saws at it with his knife.  He places this kindling on the coals.  They sputter and sizzle. Barely catch.  He fans them with the box.  A tiny flicker catches, then starts to grow. 
CHUCK Firewood.  I need firewood. 
SERIES OF SHOTS 
On the beach, Chuck desperately gathers more firewood in the driving monsoon.  He can barely see.  Driven by the storm, the waves are licking at the palm grove. 
He runs through the woods.  Branches whip at his face.  Roots tear at his feet, tripping him. 
He stumbles up the lava field.  Sliding.  Struggling.  Barely able to breathe, the rain is so strong. 
INT.  CAVE - DAY 
He dumps the firewood on the floor of the cave.  But where the fire had flickered, there is only a pile of wet black ashes. 
THE FIRE IS OUT. 
INT.  CAVE - NIGHT 
Chuck lies on the floor of the cave, shivering in the darkness as the rain falls.  His fire is out, his tooth is killing him, he can't escape. 
EXT.  CAVE - NEXT DAY 
Chuck emerges from the cave.  The rain has stopped.  This is the absolute lowest.  His face reflects his pain and despair. He's trapped.  It's hopeless.  Everything he tried to build is gone. 
EXT.  LEDGE - DAY 
Chuck slowly walks out on the ledge.  He stares down at the waves breaking on the jagged rocks far below. 
He lets go one hand.  Then lets go the other.  He is barely balanced.  It looks like a wisp of breeze would blow him right off.  He slides one foot to the very lip of the precipice. 
Suddenly his foot slips! 
Instinctively he turns into the cliff, grabs for a hold!  One hand reaches for a nubbing of rock, slips off!  The other closes, his fingers straining to hold him.

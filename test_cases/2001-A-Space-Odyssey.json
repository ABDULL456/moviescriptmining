M-G-M Studios, Boreham Wood, Herts. \nTITLE\t\t\t\t\t    PART I AFRICA 3,000,000 YEARS AGO \nA1 VIEWS OF AFRICAN DRYLANDS - DROUGHT \nThe remorseless drought had lasted now for ten million years, and would not end for another million. The reign of the ter- rible lizards had long since passed, but here on the continent which would one day be known as Africa, the battle for survival had reached a new climax of ferocity, and the victor was not yet in sight. In this dry and barren land, only the small or the swift or the fierce could flourish, or even hope to exist. \na1 \nA2 INT & EXT CAVES - MOONWATCHER \nThe man-apes of the field had none of these attributes, and they were on the long, pathetic road to racial extinction. About twenty of them occupied a group of caves overlooking a small, parched valley, divided by a sluggish, brown stream. \nThe tribe had always been hungry, and now it was starving. As the first dim glow of dawn creeps into the cave, Moonwatcher discovers that his father has died during the night. He did not know the Old One was his father, for such a relationship was beyond his understanding. but as he stands looking down at the emac- iated body he feels something, something akin to sadness. Then he carries his dead father out of the cave, and leaves him for the hyenas. \nAmong his kind, Moonwatcher is almost a giant. He is nearly five feet high, and though badly undernourished, weighs over a hundred pounds. His hairy, muscular body is quite man-like, and his head is already nearer man than ape. The forehead is low, and there are great ridges over the eye-sockets, yet he unmistakably holds in his genes the promise of humanity. As he looks out now upon the hostile world, there is already \na2 \nA2 CONTINUED \nsomething in his gaze beyond the grasp of any ape. In those dark, deep-set eyes is a dawning awareness-the first intima- tions of an intelligence which would not fulfill itself for another two million years. \na3 \nA3 EXT  THE STREAM - THE OTHERS \nAs the dawn sky brightens, Moonwatcher and his tribe reach the shallow stream. \nThe Others are already there. They were there on the other side every day - that did not make it any less annoying. \nThere are eighteen of them, and it is impossible to distinguish them from the members of Moonwatcher's own tribe. As they see him coming, the Others begin to angrily dance and shriek on their side of the stream, and his own people reply In kind. \nThe confrontation lasts a few minutes - then the display dies out as quickly as it has begun, and everyone drinks his fill of the muddy water. Honor has been satisfied - each group has staked its claim to its own territory. \na4 \nA4 EXT  AFRICAN PLAIN - HERBIVORES \nMoonwatcher and his companions search for berries, fruit and leaves, and fight off pangs of hunger, while all around them, competing with them for the samr fodder, is a potential source of more food than they could ever hope to eat. Yet all the thousands of tons of meat roaming over the parched savanna and through the brush is not only beyond their reach; the idea of eating it is beyond their imagination. They are slowly starving to death in the midst of plenty. \na5 \nA5 EXT  PARCHED COUNTRYSIDE - THE LION \nThe tribe slowly wanders across the bare, flat country- side foraging for roots and occasional berries. \nEight of them are irregularly strung out on the open plain, about fifty feet apart. \nThe ground is flat for miles around. \nSuddenly, Moonwatcher becomes aware of a lion, stalking them about 300 yards away. \nDefenceless and with nowhere to hide, they scatter in all directions, but the lion brings one to the ground. \na6 \nHe sits up in the fetid darkness of the cave, straining his senses out into the night, and fear creeps slowly into his soul. Never in his life - already twice as long as most members of his species could expect - has he heard a sound like this. The great cats approached in silence, and the only thing that betrayed them was a rare slide of earth, or the occasional cracking of a twig. Yet this is a continuing crunching noise that grows steadily louder. It seemed that some enormous beast was moving through the night, making no attempt at concealment, and ignoring all obstacles. \nAnd then there came a sound which Moonwatcher could not possibly have identified, for it had never been heard before in the history of this planet. \na13 \nA10 EXT CAVE - NEW ROCK \nMoonwatcher comes face to face with the New Rock when he leads the tribe down to the river in the first light of morning. He had almost forgotten the terror of the night, because nothing had happened after that initial noise, so he does not even associate this strange thing with danger or with fear. There is nothing in the least alarming about it. \nIt is a cube about fifteen feet on a side, and it is made of some completely transparent material; indeed, it is not easy to see except when the light of the sun glints on its edges. There are no natural objects to which Moonwatcher can compare this apparition. Though he is wisely cautious of most new things, he does not hesitate to walk up to it. As nothing happens, he puts out his hand, and feels a warm, hard surface. \nAfter several minutes of intense thought, he arrives at a brilliant explanation. It is a rock, of course, and it must have grown during the night. There are many plants that do this - white, pulpy things shaped like pebbles, that seem to shoot up in the hours of darkness. It is true that they are small and round, whereas this is large and square; \na14 \nA10 CONTINUED \nbut greater and later philosophers than Moonwatcher would be prepared to overlook equally striking exceptions to their laws. \nThis really superb piece of abstract thinking leads Moonwatcher to a deduction which he immediately puts to the test. The white, round pebble-plants are very tasty (though there were a few that made one violently sick); perhaps this square one...? \nA few licks and attempted nibbles quickly disillusion him. There is no nourishment here; so like a sensible hominid, he continues on his way to the river and forgets all about the Cube. \na15 \nA11 EXT CUBE - FIRST LESSON \nThey are still a hundred yards from the New Rock when the sound begins. \nIt is quite soft, and it stops them in their tracks, so that they stand paralyzed on the trail with their jaws hanging. A simple, maddeningly repetitious rhythm pulses out of the crystal cube and hypnotises all who come within its spell. For the first time - and the last, for two million year - the sound of drumming is heard in Africa. \nThe throbbing grows louder, more insistent. Presently the hominids begin to move forward like sleep-walkers, towards the source of that magnetic sound. Sometimes they take little dancing steps, as their blood responds to the rhythms that their descendants will not create for ages yet. \nTotally entranced, they gather around the Cube, forgetting the hardships of the day, the perils of the approaching dusk, and the hunger in their bellies. \nNow, spinning wheels of light begin to merge, and the spokes fuse into luminous bars that slowly recede into the distance, \na16 \nA11 CONTINUED \nrotating on their axes as they do; and the hominids watch, wide- eyed, mesmerized captives of the Crystal Cube. \nThen by some magic - though it was no more magical than all that had gone on before - a perfectly normal scene appears. It is as if a cubical block had been carved out of the day and shifted into the night. Inside that block is a group of four hominids, who might have been members of Moonwatcher's own tribe, eating chunks of meat. The carcass of a wart-hog lies near them. \nThis little family of male and female and two children is gorged and replete, with sleek and glossy pelts - and this was a condition of life that Moonwatcher had never imagined. From time to time they stir lazily, as they loll at ease near the entrance of their cave, apparently at peace with the world. The spectacle of domestic bliss merges into a totally different scene. \nThe family is no longer reposing peacefully outside its cave; it is foraging, searching for food like any normal hominids. \na17 \nA11 CONTINUED \nA small wart-hog ambles past the group of browsing humanoids without giving them more than a glance, for they had never been the slightest danger to its species. \nBut that happy state of affairs is about to end. The big male suddenly bends down, picks up a heavy stone lying at his feet - and hurls it upon the unfortunate pig. The stone descends upon its skull, making exactly the same noise that Moonwatcher had produced in his now almost forgotten encounter with Big-Tooth. And the result, too, is much the same - the warthog gives one amazed, indignant squeal, and collapses in a motionless heap. \nThen the whole sequence begins again, but this time it unfolds itself with incredible slowness. Every detail of the movement can be followed; the stone arches leisurely through the air, the pig crumples up and sinks to the ground. There the scene freezes for long moments, the slayer standing motionless above the slain, the first of all weapons in his hand. \nThe scene suddenly fades out. The cube is no more than a glimmering outline in the darkness; the hominids stir, as if \na18 \nA11 CONTINUED \nMoonwatcher, who had been partly concealed by two males who walked before him, thrusts his arm high into the air. In his hand he holds a stoud tree branch. Mounted atop the branch is the bloody head of the lion, its mouth jammed open with a stick, displaying its frightful fangs. \nThe Others gape in fearful disbelief at this display of power. \nMoonwatchers stands motionless, thrusting the lion's head high. Then with majestic deliberation, still carrying his mangled standard above his head, he begins to cross the stream, followed by his band. \nThe Others fade back from the stream, seeming to lack even the ability to flee. \nMoonwatcher steps ashore and walks to One-Ear, who stands \na25 \nA14 CONTINUED \nunsurely in front of his band. \nThough he is a veteran of numerous combats at the water's edge, One-Ear has never been attacked by an enemy who had not first displayed his fighting rage; and he had never before been attacked with a weapon. One-Ear, merely looks up at the raised club until the heavey thigh bone of an antelope brings the darkness down around him. \nThe Others stare in wonder at Moonwatcher's power. \nMoonwatcher surveys the scene. Now he was master of the world, and he was not sure what to do next. But he would think of something. \na26 \nA SECTION TIMING \nA1    00.30 A2    00.45 A3    01.30 A4    00.30 A5    01.00 A6    01.00 A7    01.00 A8    03.00 A9    00.45 A10   02.00 A11   04.00 A12   02.00 A13   02.30 A14   02.30 \nA SECTION TOTAL: @23 MIN. 00 SECS \nTITLE\t\t\t\t\tPART II \nYEAR 2001 \na26a \nB1 EARTH FROM 200 MILES UP\t\t\t\t\t NARRATOR By the year 2001, overpopulation has B1a\t\t\t\t\t\t replaced the problem of starvation THOUSAND MEGATON\t\t\t   but this was ominously offset by the NUCLEAR BOMB IN ORBIT\t\t   absolute and utter perfection of the ABOVE THE EARTH,\t\t\t   weapon.

Denying the men permission to land was a direct violation of the I.A.S. convention. \nFLOYD Yes...

He has just completed a special flight here from Earth to be with us, and before the briefing he would like to say a few words. Dr. Floyd. \nPOLITE APPLAUSE. FLOYD WALKS TO FRONT OF ROOM. \nFLOYD First of all, I bring a personal message from Dr. Howell, who has asked me to convey his deepest appreciation to all of you for the personal sacrifices you have made, and of course his congratulations on your discovery which may well prove to be among the most significant in the history of science. \nPOLITE APPLAUSE. \n11/25/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t b54 \nB38 CONTINUED \nFLOYD (cont'd) Mr. Halvorsen has made known to me some of the conflicting views held by many of you regarding the need for complete security in this matter, and more specifically your strong opposition to the cover story created to give the impression there is an epidemic at the Base. I understand that beyond it being a matter of principle, many of you are troubled by the concern and anxiety this story of an epidemic might cause your relatives and friends on Earth. \nI can understand and sympathize with your negative views. I have been personally embarrassed by this cover story. But I fully accept the need for absolute secrecy and I hope you will. \nIt should not be difficult for all of you to realise the potential for cutural shock and social disorientation contained in the present situation if the facts were prematurely and suddenly made public without adequate preparation and conditioning. \n11/25/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t b55 \nB38 CONTINUED \nFLOYD This is the view of the Council and the purpose of my visit here is to gather addition facts and opinions on the situation and to prepare a report to the Council recommending when and how the news should eventually be announced. Are there any questions? \nMICHAELS Dr. Floyd, how long do you think this can be kept under wraps? \nFLOYD (pleasantly) I'm afraid it can and it will be kept under wraps as long as it is deemed to be necessary by the Council. And of course you know that the Council has requested that formal security oaths are to be obtained in writing from every- one who had any knowledge of this event. There must be adequate time for a full study to be made of the situation before any con- sideration can be given to making a public announcement. \n11/25/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t b63 \nB44 CONTINUED \nMICHAELS might do something, but we don't want to be too rough until we know a little more. \nFLOYD But you don't have any idea as to what it is? \nMICHAELS Tomb, shine, survey-marker spare part, take your choice. \nHALVORSEN The only thing about it that we are sure of is that it is the first direct evidence of intelligent life beyond the Earth. \nSILENT APPRECIATION \nHALVORSEN Four million years ago, something, presumably from the stars, must have swept through the solar system and left this behind. \n11/25/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t b64 \nB44 CONTINUED \nFLOYD Was it abandoned, forgotten, left for a purpose? \nHALVORSEN I suppose we'll never know. \nMICHAELS The moon would have made an excellent base camp for preliminary Earth surveys. \nSOME MORE SILENCE \nFLOYD Any ideas about the colour? \nMICHAELS Well, not really. At first glance, black would suggest something sun-powered, but then why would anyone deliberately bury a sun- powered device? \nFLOYD Has it been exposed to any sun before now? \nMICHAELS I don't think it has, but I'd like to check that. Simpson, what's the log on that? \n11/25/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t b65 \nB45 INSIDE MONITOR DOME WE SEE A NUMBER OF TELEVISION DISPLAYS INCLUDING SEVERAL TV VIEWS OF FLOYD AND COMPANY IN THE EXCAVATION. \nSIMPSON The first surface was exposed at 0843 on the 12th April...

The type of obsessional error he may be guilty of is not unknown among the latest generation of HAL 9000 computers. \nIt has almost always revolved around a single detail, such as the one you have described, and it has never interfered with the integrity or reliability of the computer's performance in other areas. \nNo one is certain of the cause of this kind of malfunctioning.

I'll pu him on... \nFLOYD (con't) radiation in the radio spectrum which seems to have triggered by the Lunar sunrise. \nLuckily for those at the site, it proved harmless. \nPerhaps you can imagine our astonishment when we later found it was aimed precisely at Saturn. A lot of thought went into the question of wether or not it was sun-triggered, as it seemed illogical to deliberately bury a sun-powered device. \nBurying it could only shield it from the sun, since its intense magnetic field made it otherwise easily detectable. \nWe finally concluded that the only reason you might bury a sun- powered device would be to keep it inactive until it would be uncovered, at which time it would absorb sunlight and trigger itself.

The object was buried on the moon about four million years ago, when our ancestors were primative man-apes. \nWe've examined dozens of theories, but the one that has the most currency at the moment is that the object serves as an alarm. \nWhat the purpose of the alarm is, why they wish to have the alarm, whether the alarm represents any danger to us?  These are questions no one can answer. The intentions of an alien world, at least four million years older than we are, cannot be reliably predicted. \nIn view of this, the intelligence and scientific communities felt that any public announcment might lead to significant cultural shock and disorientation. \nDiscussion took place at the highest levels between govern- (con't) \n12/14/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t c126 \nC150 CONTINUED \nFLOYD (con't) ments, and it was decided that the only wise and precautionary course to follow was to assume that the intentions of this alien world are potentially dangerous to us, until we have evidence to the contrary. \nThis is, of course, why security has been maintained and why this information has been kept on a need-to-know basis. \nAnd now I should like to show you a TV monitor tape of the actual signalling event. \n12/14/65\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t c127 \nC151 WE SEE A REPLAY OF THE TMA-1 RADIO EMISSION, AS SEEN FROM A TV MONITOR ON THE SPOT.

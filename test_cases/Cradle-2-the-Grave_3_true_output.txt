INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - CONTINUOUS ACTION Where the BUG BOMBS HISS away. Fait tries the WINDOW. Locked shut. He quickly tapes it. BREAKS it. He and Miles climbs inside. Grab the bug bombs and toss them out. As Miles locks the door, Fait opens a gear bag and pulls out a folding metal detector. Uses it to scan the entire room quickly: floor, walls, ceiling... Gets LOW-VOLUME RING-OFFS from various hidden metal. But he's looking for something bigger. BLEEE.   He gets it when he sweeps past Chambers' big desk. FAIT Safe. He kneels.     Removes a desk panel.   And... There it is.     The safe is small but highly secure. FAIT Take it down. Miles finishes assembling a Barrett .50 caliber rifle. A big gun. Opens an ammo box labeled "Depleted Uranium. .50 cal." 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY Daria's down to bare essentials -- still dancing slow and sexy for Odion. 
INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY Miles loads one of the massive D.U. cartridges into the Barrett. MILES Even with the music, they're gonna hear it when I fire this tank buster. FAIT Daria.   Get ready to move. (then) 
Do it. Miles aims the BARRETT directly at the safe lock.      Miles FIRES. BIG BANG. 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY Odion starts. ODION What was that? 
INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY 
Basically, the lock's just gone. Melted. Burned through by the DU slug. Fait swings the safe door open. 
INT. PRIVATE ROOM - NIGHT Odion's heading out the door. When he stops.       Looks back at Daria. A realization dawning. ODION 'Sometimes you need an old friend'... He steps toward Daria.    Backhands her.   Hard.   Then opens the door. A CHAMBERS MAN outside the door addresses Odion. CHAMBERS MAN It came from the office. ODION Watch her.   Don't let her leave. Odion goes. The Man enters. Shuts the door, leering at Daria, who starts putting on what she's taken off. 
INT. CHAMBERS' OFFICE - DAY Fait's tossed the safe.     No stones. MILES Not here? FAIT They're here.    Somewhere else. MILES What're you talking about? 
FAIT I'm telling you, they're here. MILES What're we gonna do?

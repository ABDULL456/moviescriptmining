BILLY Those mountains? are they? 
DRIVER (Greece (shakes his head) Very bad now. Maybe war. Those Greek pigs try to steal Cyprus again (pause)) How'd you lose your friends? 
BILLY leaning back in his seat, casual. 
BILLY Oh, I drank a lot of raka last night in Istanbul. Got into a fight. 
Indicates the bruises on his face. 
DRIVER looking at him in the rear view mirror. His curiosity narrowing. 
DRIVER How come you speak Turkish so good? 
BILLY casually glances out the window. 
BILLY Did twenty months in prison in Istanbul.  Hash 
THE DRIVER studies BILLY in the rear-view mirror. Then: 
DRIVER You want to score some?  Cheap? 
BILLY looks at him hard. Something's wrong with this man. 
BILLY (curt) No! 
Cutting off further conversation, he looks out at: 
THE MOUNTAINS of Greece - with longing. 
BILLY stares back at: 
THE DRIVER whose eyes now move away from the rear-view mirror under the pressure of the stare.  SOUND OFF loud machinery. 
BILLY turning - in rear window, we see a TURKISH HALFTRACK pulling alongside the cab, SOLDIERS waving their arms for the cabdriver to get out of the way. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - the HALFTRACK pulls level. The CABDRIVER slows down, with a curse. 
BILLY - beads of sweat trickle his brow 
THE PERSONNEL CARRIER, disinterested, pulls past. 
BILLY breathes heavily with nervous relief. 
CUT: 
THE CAB pulls up to the end of a dirt road. 
BILLY has his MAP out, studying it. 
BILLY The Maritas River? Where is it? 
ANOTHER ANGLE - the DRIVER, exasperated, waves southwest. 
DRIVER Two miles! Minefields over there. Do you know where this campground is or not? 
BILLY Not far. Just a little way. 
DRIVER No!  I'm not going any further! It'll wreck my car. 
BILLY I'll pay extra 
DRIVER How much? 
ANOTHER ANGLE - BILLY slips him fifty lira. The DRIVER takes it, muttering under his breath, jams the cab into gear. 
THE CAB follows rutted tracks into low HILLS. 
INTERIOR CAB - very bumpy. 
BILLY Where are the minefields? 
DRIVER All over.  Turkish Army up there. It's against the law. They shoot us. (looks up in the mirror) You sure you looking for your friends, man? 
BILLY(VERY SHARP NOW) (very sharp now) Okay!  Ley me out right here.  I'm getting tired of all this bullshit from you.  I'll walk it. 
DRIVER (looks back, then ahead, suddenly brightening) Ah, look!  they probably know where the campers are 
BILLY's entire expression changes. It is all over. 
A TANK AND HALFTRACK are sitting there by the rutted track, with SOLDIERS. And a little LEAN-TO with several POLICE. Also a couple of attack DOGS on leashes. The Driver honks his horn on the approach. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
DRIVER Hey officer, we're looking for the campground. Do you know where it is? 
ANOTHER ANGLE - TWO POLICEMEN and A SOLDIER come sauntering over, their collars open, beer bottles in hand, slightly drunk.

phone numbers!? 
PUPKIN expertly flips to a middle page in the book and, keeping the book open, his finger pointing under a name, he turns the book to RITA. 
RITA That's her name. 
PUPKIN Her name! She signed this herself, especially for me. 
RITA starts flipping through the book, curious about the other names. She isn't paying any attention to what PUPKIN is saying. 
PUPKIN She wasn't a great actress but she had a real gift for comedy. She died tragically, you know, alone, like so many of the world's most beautiful women. I'm going to see that doesn't happen to you, Rita. 
RITA Who's this one? 
PUPKIN checks the book. 
PUPKIN Burt Reynolds. 
RITA Oh yeah, the guy with no clothes. Who's this? 
PUPKIN Mel Brooks. 
RITA And this? 
PUPKIN Carol Burnett. 
RITA No kidding.    How about this? 
PUPKIN Glenda Jackson. 
RITA Never heard of her. 
PUPKIN (pointing to other names) And that's Woody Allen and there's 
Ernie Kovacs -- he's dead -- and that one's Lauren Bacall. 
RITA You don't really know any of these people? 
PUPKIN Take a look at this. 
PUPKIN flips to one of the back pages and shows a name to RITA. 
RITA (squinting) I can't make it out. 
PUPKIN Try. 
RITA This is really weird handwriting! 
Exasperated, PUPKIN follows the name in question with his index finger. 
PUPKIN Rooooper .... 
RITA (guessing) Redford! 
PUPKIN That's Robert Redford. 
RITA It is? 
PUPKIN No!    It's ... it's Rupert Pupkin 
PUPKIN tears out the page and hands it to her shyly.   RITA just stares at it and back at PUPKIN. 
PUPKIN Don't lose it. It's going to be worth something in a couple of weeks. 
RITA start laughing. 
PUPKIN That's what I've been trying to tell you. Things are really breaking for me. I'm ticketed for stardom. 
RITA laughs harder, despite efforts to be serious. 
PUPKIN Only a couple of hours ago, I was talking to Jerry Langford, the Jerry Langford. Stop it, Rita! 
RITA pulls herself together for a moment. 
PUPKIN We were talking about my doing my act on his show. 
RITA (suppressing a smile) Your act? 
PUPKIN Get    that guy you knew from Clifton out of    your head right now. You're looking at    Rupert Pupkin, Rita. Rupert Pupkin, the    new King of Comedy. 
RITA starts laughing hysterically, in spite of herself. 
RITA (getting a grip on herself) I'm sorry. 
PUPKIN Why not me, Rita? A guy can always get what he wants if he's willing to pay the price. All it takes is a little talent and sacrifice and the right break. If you've got a friend in the right place, that's all it takes. And that's exactly what I have going for me right now. After all, crazier things have happened. 
RITA listens silently for a moment, then begins to giggle. As PUPKIN resumes speaking, we CUT between RITA and the YOUNG MAN. Their flirtation picks up steam. The YOUNG MAN raises his eyebrows as if to ask, "Are you interested in me?" She smiles. All the while, PUPKIN rattles on. 
PUPKIN You just don't realize what a shot on the Langford Show can mean. That's coast to coast, national TV, a bigger audience than the greatest comedians used to play to in a lifetime. A shot like that means a free ticket on the comedy circuit -- Flip Wilson one week, Cosby the next, then Sonny and Cher or Carol Burnett. And you've always got those other talk shows to fall back on -- Carson, Griffin. And all that leads straight in one direction, Rita -- Hollywood! That's when we really start 
living. How does this sound to you -- a beach house in Malibu, right on the ocean. You'll get a beautiful tan, believe me. And we'd keep a suite at the Sherry. That's the only place to stay when you're big. We could get something on a top floor and look down on all our old friends in Clifton and just laugh. How does that sound to you? 
RITA It sounds wonderful, Rupert, and I really hope you get what you want. But it's getting late and I'm a working girl. You know what I mean?

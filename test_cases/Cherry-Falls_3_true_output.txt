Leonard comes out of the basement and peers into the living room. 
INT.    LIVING ROOM 
Leonard sees Kenny opening Jody's purse, checking it out. 
Leonard keeps the razor hidden behind his back. 
LEONARD My wallet's on the mantle when you've finished your rifling, Kenny. 
Kenny looks up, startled. 
KENNY (nervously) Oh, hey Mr. Marliston. W-What's Jody's bike doing on your front porch? 
LEONARD That all depends Kenny. Depends on why the FUCK you've broken into your history teacher's house? 
KENNY Alright, Marliston, I know she's here. 
LEONARD What are you talking about? No one here but us chickens. 
INT.  BASEMENT 
Jody cuts through her dad's ropes. Her dad immediately takes Jody's gag off. 
INT.  LIVING ROOM 
Kenny heads out the door. 
JODY(O.C.) Help! 
Kenny hears the cry and turns around. 
KENNY That was Jody! 
Leonard says nothing. He just stares at Kenny. 
JODY(O.C.) Somebody help! 
Kenny heads toward the basement door to investigate. Brent starts kicking on the other side of the locked door. 
KENNY Jody?! 
Leonard moves towards Kenny with the razor. Kenny turns just in time.  He grabs Leonard's arm as Leonard tries to slit his throat. They struggle. 
The door lock starts to shake as Brent continues to kick the door open from the other side. 
Leonard picks up a  lamp with his free hand and smashes Kenny across the head. Kenny falls to the ground. 
The door pops open. Brent charges out. Leonard turns to him and slashes him across the chest as Brent sprays red paint in Leonard's eyes. Leonard screams, and lunges at Brent. 
Brent grabs Leonard. Using every ounce of energy he has, he throws Leonard down the basement stairs. 
Leonard grabs Brent as he tumbles down the stairs. The two roll to the bottom, smashing their heads along the way. As they come to a stop, Brent smashes his head hard on the floor. Leonard ends up on top of him. He raises the razor and slits Brent across the face. 
BRENT Jody run! 
Jody crawls up the stairs, dragging her bad leg. 
Instinctually, Brent hangs on to Leonard, as Leonard tries to get to Jody. Leonard slashes Brent across the face again. 
JODY No! 
BRENT (dying) Run! 
Jody crawls to the top of the stairs.  Leonard does everything he can to get away from Brent but Brent hangs on.  Jody watches, horrified, at the top of the stair. Kenny appears at the top of the stairs and pulls Jody away from the gruesome sight as Leonard continues to slash Brent's body open. Brent rolls over, a bloody mess. 
INT.  TOP OF STAIRS 
Kenny slams the door shut as Leonard charges up the stairs. Kenny holds the door shut with all his might. 
JODY My dad's down there! 
KENNY He's dead! We've got to get the fuck out of here! 
Kenny pushes a dresser in front of it, trapping Leonard. 
JODY I can't walk. I think he cut right through a tendon. 
Leonard starts chopping through the door with an axe. 
Kenny helps Jody out the front door. 
EXT.  HOUSE 
Jody and Kenny limp out of the house. Kenny grabs Jody's bike.

{"train": "EXT. MOUNTAIN CLEARING - A LITTLE LATER \nA Pave Hawk SH-60 helicopter, rotors whirling slowly, waits. Shane's chopper appears from behind a tree line and sets down atop the mountain by a stream. \nShane and Charles sprint from the chopper towards the waiting Hawk. Charles stops Shane. \nCHARLES Lieutenant, thank you. (He pats his briefcase) You saved more than just my life today. Can I call my wife to let her know I'm okay? \nSHANE Negative. Not imperative to the mission. We have to keep moving. I have strict orders to get you out of here safely. \nCHARLES I'm safe, Lieutenant. Please. She thinks I'm dead. (then) Don't you have a family? \nSHANE (this gets him:) Make it quick. \nCharles picks up his briefcase. He holds the lock up to his mouth and whispers into it: \nCHARLES Joe, Todd, Lulu, Peter, Tyler. \nThe briefcase pops open. Shane looks at him, puzzled. \nCHARLES (CONT'D) My kids. It's voice activated. Designed it myself. I do security, that's my specialty. (gestures back:) Those guys back there tried to get this case open for five days -- couldn't crack it. And you should see what happens to you if open it without the code. I have a picture of my kids in here, you want to see it? \nSHANE Negative. \nCharles takes a cell-phone out of the case. Shane looks in the case: it's EMPTY, except for the phone and a family PHOTO. Charles dials his cell phone... nothing \nCHARLES Battery's dead... \nShane considers, then hands him his satellite phone. Charles dials, and talks... \nCHARLES (CONT'D) Honey, I'm alive... \nINT. PAVE HAWK - CONTINUOUS \nShane climbs in the Hawk and approaches the cockpit.    The PILOT sits, back to him. \nSHANE We're almost ready.    Just gives us a - \nThe Pilot slumps forward... DEAD. Shane turns- \nSHANE (CONT'D) Professor, RUN!!! \nWHAM.   Shane drops, knocked unconscious.   All goes black. \nEXT. PAVE HAWK - MOMENTS LATER \nThe helicopter is on fire. Wolf lies facedown in the stream. He looks around, barely conscious. \nSHANE'S P.O.V.: Everything is a blur, in slow-motion. He sees Charles, unconscious. A Huey Helicopter lands. A VERY TALL MAN steps out, and takes Charles' Briefcase. There is huge explosion, as the chopper ignites. Everything is ablaze. Shane reaches out, grabs the picture of Charles' kids then goes unconscious. F ADE TO BLACK: \nEST. HOSPITAL - DAY \nTITLE CARD: 1 Month Later \nINT. HOSPITAL - DAY \nShane lies in a hospital bed, despondent. His arm and face bandaged. \nShane's Captain enters: BILL FAWCETT (35) -- friendly, unassuming. He looks like he hasn't slept in days. Shane salutes him with his bandaged arm -- it hurts to salute, but he does it anyway. \nSHANE Captain, sir. \nBILL As you were Lieutenant. \nBill sits down beside the bed. He takes a long look at Shane. He holds a REPORT in his hand. \nBILL (CONT'D) We've been through a lot together Shane. You're the best man I ever trained. And a good friend. \nSHANE ... I know sir. And I except full responsibility for the mission's failure. \nBILL Why the hell did you let him use the satellite phone? \nSHANE He had to call his family. A lapse in judgement on my part that I regret sir. \nBill shakes his head, disappointed. He pulls up a chair, and sits opposite Shane. \nBILL ... Plummer was the best security expert the department of defense ever had -- a genius. He was working on a program that scrambles launch codes. He called it G.H.O.S.T.: Guided High-altitude Scrambling Transmitter. One pulse from the GHOST satellite and a country can't launch its own nukes. That's what the Serbians kidnapped him for, but they couldn't get S inside the briefcase. \nSHANE The case was empty sir, as I stated in my report. \nBill considers this. Then... \nBILL Not a surprise, really. Not like the professor to hide things where someone might look for them. G.H.O.S.T. is still out there, (Bill smiles:) which is why I'm going to give you another shot. \nJULIE And this is Helga and Tyler. \nShane nods hello to them. \nSHANE (official:) Ma'am... Baby. \nJULIE Kids, go finish your homework.   And I'll be checking. \nZoe, Lulu and Todd climb back up the stairs. Julie leads Shane into... \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nJulie sits, Shane stands \"at ease\" (which doesn't look \"at ease\" at all). \nSHANE You have a pleasant family, ma'am. \nJULIE Charles wasn't around too much. His work took him all over the world. He'd be gone six or seven months at a time. So I think for the younger ones it's a little confusing. Zoe and Todd... well, they're dealing like your normal teenagers. Maybe in Todd's case semi-normal. \nSHANE Mrs. Plummer, I have to tell you that I did everything I could... \nJULIE Charles was in a dangerous business. I knew it when I married him. No one's to blame here. (beat) Everyone thinks that Charles told me or the kids where he hid it. And until G.H.O.S.T. is found, we're all in danger. \nSHANE Nothing will happen to your family as long as I'm here. I've dealt with much... \nSuddenly from behind Shane's head a DUCK appears and NIBBLES his ear. Shane spins in full fight stance. He sees the Duck... and relaxes. Sort of. \nJULIE That's Gary. He was Charles'. \nThe duck QUACKS angrily. Confused, Shane returns to \"at ease,\" keeping one eye on the duck. \nSHANE Mrs. Plummer- \nJULIE Call me Julie. \nBeat. \nSHANE ... Mrs. Plummer, I'll go secure the perimeter. \nJULIE I'm glad you're here- \nBut Shane is already gone. \nCUT TO: \nMONTAGE. MILITARY MUSIC PLAYS: \nShane secures the area.       He paces off the yard. \nHe mounts surveillance cameras in the eaves. \nHe attaches contact alarms in the doors and windows. \nShane climbs a telephone pole, opens the circuit box and TAPS the phones. \nShane, now wearing an EAR TRANSMITTER, crawls through the shrubs, hiding electric eyes. \nNighttime -- the family eats dinner. We slowly pull out... through the kitchen window... and reveal Shane with night vision goggles on scoping the property. \nThe phone RINGS inside. Through the window, Julie casually answers it. Shane touches his ear transmitter and LISTENS as he walks into the house. \nBILL (o.s.) Julie, it's Bill Fawcett. I have some potentially good news. \nJULIE What is it? \nBILL (o.s.) A safety deposit box under Charles' name was just found in Switzerland. I think it could contain GHOST. \nJULIE That's wonderful. This could all be over! \nBILL (o.s.) There's a catch. Swiss law says only his family can access it. I'm going to need you on a plane tomorrow morning. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nShane, listening to the conversation, enters- \nJULIE I'll be there. \nJulie and Shane share a look. \nINT. PLUMMER HOUSE/FOYER - MORNING \nJulie, with her suitcase, Shane, Helga and the Kids stand in the doorway. Zoe listens to her I-Pod ignoring the hug Julie gives her. \nJULIE Don't worry about the Kids, Helga will handle everything. (Worried:) But if there is an emergency, all the emergency numbers are on the fridge. And on the phone. And on the back door... \nMR. CHUN (perfect English, no accent) We speak English, Kojak. \nSHANE Oh. Sorry. \nMRS. CHUN ... Look, about the 2000 decibel alarm and the kleig lights and stuff... we own a bakery, so we're up kind of early. Would you mind? \nSHANE Sorry. \nShane pulls a remote control from his pocket and clicks it. The alarm stops. \nMR. CHUN Thanks a bunch. Oh, and we found this in our pool filter... Try to keep that zoo reigned in, huh baby-sitter? \nMr. Chun tosses him the TROLL DOLL and slam their window shut. Shane's about to head inside, he pulls a tiny camera phone from his pocket, and snaps a shot of the Chun's car in their driveway. I INT. PLUMMER HOUSE - NIGHT \nhane marches Zoe up the stairs. Loud, angry rock music blares from Todd's room. \nSHANE Your mother thought you were in real danger. You should have told her the truth. \nZOE Who do you think you are -- my dad? \nZoe starts to turn -- then suddenly spins and tries kicking him in the CROTCH. But Shane catches her foot -- and whirls her away. She has to hop on one foot, to not fall over. He \"hops\" her down the hall to her room. \nS W \nZOE (CONT'D) Let me go! It's Saturday night.   I have plans! \nZoe's back to her door, Shane flips her foot in the air. Zoe falls backwards into the room. Shane shuts her door. \nSHANE Not anymore. \nShane marches back down the hall, bangs on Todd's door- \nSHANE (CONT'D) Lights out. \nTODD (o.s.) Bite me! \nShane frowns, continues down the hall. He passes the NURSERY (Peter and Tyler's room), where Helga is singing a lullaby: (as annoying Has something Barney might sing). \nELGA When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you feel like you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Peter Panda Dance. Just hop three times like a kangaroo -- \nShe does a little \"dance\" that goes with the lullaby: She hops forwards three times, then \"crab-walks\" sideways. \nHELGA (CONT'D) Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do. Three steps forward, one step back. \nShe does. The Children, in bed -- laugh and laugh. \nHELGA (CONT'D) Then quick like a turtle lie on your back! riggle like a snake `til you can't no more. \nhe wriggles on the floor. Then jumps up, to their beds. Shane shakes his head, keeps walking- \nSHANE This family's in for a rude awakening. \nT \nZ \nZ T \nEXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - DAWN \nThe sun rises over the neighborhood, warm orange light. \nINT. HOUSE - SAME TIME \nEveryone is asleep. In the bedrooms, a SERIES OF SHOTS: \nL Tyler snores in his crib.       Peter in his bed. \nulu is surrounded by stuffed animals. \nodd is out cold, motionless. \noe is wrapped in blankets. Until A TRUMPET BLARES \"REVEILLE\"! Zoe jumps, like she's been electrocuted. \nOE Huh?   Wha--?! \nINT. TODD'S ROOM - MORNING \nTodd sits up, disoriented, not understanding what's happening. The Whistle GETS LOUDER. Suddenly his door flies open -- and Shane strides in with a BOOM BOX. Todd blinks groggily. \nTODD W-what are you doing??! \nSHANE You're burning daylight. Move.       Move. \nThe bathroom door opens, and Todd comes sauntering back. He sees Shane, the destroyed door and wall... \nSHANE All I need is a hammer and some plaster of Paris. I can fix this. \nA piece of the ceiling falls, hits Shane on the head. \nTODD Can I get by? \nEmbarrassed, Shane steps aside, then mutters- \nSHANE Here's your bracelet. If you'd been wearing it, this wouldn't have happened. \nShane SNAPS it onto Todd's wrist, and head down the hall, patrolling. Zoe comes up the stairs, to her room. She stops at Todd's door -- they glare at Shane. \nZOE He has to go. \nTodd nods in agreement. \nINT. PLUMMER HOUSE - MORNING - LATER S hane does one-handed push ups in the living room while the Duck watches. With his other hand he loads the PHOTO of the Chun's license plate into his laptop computer. His head shifts, he hears something suspicious -- the rumble of a car approaching. \nL \nS \nHe rushes for the front door, clicks his alarm remote and opens it, just as -- WHACK -- the MORNING PAPER connects with his face, hard. From off-screen we hear a PAPERBOY. \nPAPERBOY (O.S.) SORRY DUDE! \nShane rubs his nose. Lulu screams at the top of her lungs. Shane turns, to see that Peter is chasing her, wearing a towel as a sheet. He pretends to be a ghost. \nPETER Whhhoooooo! \nLULU Stop it, Peter! \nLulu hides behind Shane. Peter Booos again. Lulu screams. \nSHANE Hey, hey, good soldiers aren't afraid of anything. \nLULU This house is haunted. Daddy even said so. He said there's a ghost. \nAnd then it hits Shane.       His eyes light up. \nSHANE Really?   And where is this ghost? \nULU I don't know.     I've never seen it. \nINT. HALLWAY - LATER \nShane walks slowly down the hall. As he walks he glides his hands along the wall, feeling, pushing, scanning the ceiling. Searching. I INT. STAIRWAY - SAME TIME \nTodd and Zoe kneel on the stairs. They surreptitiously pour COOKING OIL all over the wood. \nThen -- a creak. Zoe whispers. \nZOE Here he comes...! \nZoe and Todd run downstairs and hide behind the couch. \nF \nShane strides to the top step and RAPS on the wall. He RAPS again, listening for hollow spaces. Nothing. Shane lifts his left foot out to take a step down... \nWhen he hears an alert from his laptop. He goes back to the living room, then turns his attention to his laptop. MR. Chun's photo appears next to a VEHICLE REGISTRATION. Shane scans it... \nTodd and Zoe's faces fall. The footsteps again- \nTODD He's coming back- \nBut Helga, carrying a huge laundry basket, appears, takes a step onto the stairs -- \nHELGA AHHH!!! \nBUMP! BUMP! BUMP! She flies down the greased stairs, BANGING her head and ass on each step, all the way down. \ninally, BAM! Helga HITS the bottom with a mighty crash. She screams, as laundry flutters down from above. T IGHT - ZOE AND TODD \nThey gulp, terrified. \nZOE Uh-oh. \nEXT. SWISS BANK - DAY \nEstablishing. \nANGLE - SHANE \nHis jaw drops in disbelief. He drops his head, defeated. Then -- he slowly glances up. \nACROSS THE STREET \nThe Korean couple is staring at him, dumbfounded. \nKOREAN WOMAN Don't worry, if she loves you, she'll come back. \nANGLE - SHANE \nRises, takes a deep breath and strides inside. \nINT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nShane enters... to find the kids are all gloomy.    The baby cries. Shane awkwardly picks the baby up. \nSHANE Okay, listen up. There's been a change of plans. Your mom's not coming back as soon as she thought... \nLULU (worried) When is she coming back? \nSHANE Soon. In the meantime, we're just gonna have some more big fun. \nTODD That's what we've been doing? \nLULU But tomorrow's a school day. \nZOE I need a signed release for Driver's Ed! \nLULU I've got Brownies! \nShane reacts, inundated. \nSHANE Whoa, WHOA! HALT! We'll take this hill one inch at a time. Only then can we rise to the challenge. All for one, and one for all! \nLULU (singing) \"Be all that you can be!\" \nSHANE That's Army. I'm Navy.     But I appreciate your enthusiasm. \nnice moment.   Until -- FWRPPPP! \nSHANE (CONT'D) Tell me that was the duck? \nFWRPPP!    WE zoom in on the baby's leering face. \nhane quickly moves the Baby away from his body. Pure self-preservation, everyone bolts from the room. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Hey.   HEY! \nNobody will help.     Even Peter runs, holding his nose. \nCLOSE-UP - SHANE \nHe gulps. \nINT. BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nShane enters, holding out the Baby at full arm's length. He lowers Tyler onto a changing pad, takes a deep breath, then pulls out PLIERS and a SCREWDRIVER. Using the tools as chopsticks, he cautiously unfastens the diaper... And then -- it flops open. SShane GROANS, repelled. \nSHANE The things I do for my country. \nShane tries approaching -- he can't do it. Aghast, he looks around for a solution. Then: Shane picks up the Baby and dips the bottom half in the toilet, then FLUSHES, over and over and over. \nINT.   HALLWAY - NIGHT \nShane patrols the hall, making sure all the doors and windows are locked. Lulu is in her pj's. \nA hand tugs on Shane's shirt, he looks down to see Lulu. \nLULU Hi. Zoe thinks you look like the Hulk. I think you're cute. \nSHANE (unsure how to respond...) Thank you. \nLulu doesn't go away, she just stares at him, it starts making Shane uncomfortable. \nLULU Do you know Kung Fu? \nSHANE Affirmative. \nLULU Did you ever punch someone so hard that their head came off? \nhane walks away from Lulu. She follows. Shane is again twirling the MEDAL in his fingers. Lulu follows at his heels, like a puppy. \nShane, back in \"uniform,\" paces in front of the Brownie Troop. They are assembled, at attention, Indian Style. \nSHANE Alright, ladies. Here's how it's gonna be. Tonight, I'm gonna be your den -- commander. That means if you want to live to see tomorrow, do as I say. DO WE UNDERSTAND EACH OTHER? \nThe Brownies stare art him in stunned silence. \nBROWNIE Den Mother? ... I'm scared of you. \nSHANE Good. Now -- wait here. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - A LITTLE LATE \nThe Brownies are in the living room, unpacking boxes of cookies, getting ready to go. Zoe's on the phone. \nZOE ... yeah, he's a total psycho. I think mom found him from one of those Tough Love boot camps or something... \nShane blows passed her, revving a cordless POWER DRILL. \nVARIOUS SHOTS: As Shane uses the drill to seal every window and door. He's not just locking them -- he's SCREWING THEM SHUT WITH DRYWALL SCREWS. \nINT. ZOE'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nShane's finishing up the last window. \nZOE This is totally cruel and unusual! You can't do this -- we could run out of air! \nShane lifts her window so it's open a HALF INCH, then drills it into place. Shane ushers the Troop out the door, then loads Peter and Tyler into TWO SNUGGLES -- one attached to his front, the other to his back. Shane closes the front door and attaches a \"Club\" lock to it. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nShane Loads the brownies and toddlers into the minivan. \nAs the minivan pulls out of the driveway, the camera CRANES up to... \nZOE'S WINDOW: \nInside, Zoe picks up the phone, hits speed-dial. \nZOE .. he's got us on lock-down, it's like Oz or something. No, not munchkin Oz -- HBO Oz. (she listens:) Hm... I dunno if that's a good idea, Scott... \nEXT. GROCERY STORE - PARKING LOT - AFTERNOON \nShane pulls the minivan into the crowded parking lot -- the Brownies are all singing 99 Bottles of Beer on the Wall at the top of their lungs. \nEXT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER \nShane (double-Snuggled) helps the Brownies set up a card table to display their cookies. \nSHANE I gotta get supplies. I can see you through the window, but if anything happens... \nLULU (flashing her bracelet) I know. \nINT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER \nShane watches the Brownies on the store's CLOSED CIRCUIT monitor, as he pushes a cart into the store. He looks around at the bright, colorful boxes of Children's Cereals, Rainbow Fruit Roll-Ups, Snack packs... NOTHING looks familiar -- nothing even looks like food. \nHe sees: a huge, 100 pack VALUE CASE of SPAM. He smiles. Tyler looks at him -- \"what are you, nuts?\" \nEXT. GROCERY STORE - CONTINUOUS \nThe Brownies are trying to sell the cookies, but they're very shy. SHOPPERS blow passed them without even noticing them. One of the Brownies spots something... \nBROWNIE Oh no... they're back. \nSLOW MOTION: In a shot out of Reservoir Dogs, we see who she means: A group of bad ass, chubby CUB SCOUTS. They're headed straight towards the cookie table, menacingly. \nUGLY CUB SCOUT (to another Scout) Hey Skeever, what's stinky and floats `til you flush `em? \n2ND SCOUT Brownies? \nThe Scouts cackle. The Ugly Scout yanks a box of cookies away from Lulu. He rips it open, dumping the cookies on the ground and grinding Uthem with his foot. \nUGLY CUB SCOUT This is Troop 16 territory. How are we supposed to sell raffle tickets when this place reeks of your skanky cookies? \n2ND SCOUT BEAT IT, before I get my face punching badge on you. \nThe Brownies take off running, clutching their boxes. One of the Scouts grabs Lulu -- she tugs and tugs, but can't get away. Finally, the Cub Scout takes her SCARF. He laughs, and lets her go. The Cub Scouts high-five. \nEXT. GROCERY STORE - MOMENTS LATER \nShane heads to the Brownie's table -- but Lulu and the Brownies are gone. In their place are the Chubby Scouts. \nSHANE Where are my troops? \nSHANE (re: the Snuggle) You don't have a baby on your chest... \nLulu's having fun now, she's just avoiding Shane's fighter, dancing, jumping, while he pounds the buttons, swinging and missing... Shane's really fuming. \nLULU You're not even trying... \nSHANE I AM TOO TRYING. \nLULU Too slow... come on -- take a shot... oops too slow... swing and a miss... \nShe keeps dancing. It's really annoying. Shane's working the joy stick hard, slamming buttons, but he can't hit her. He is KO'd. She does a very obnoxious VICTORY DANCE. \nLULU (CONT'D) In your face! I am the greatest hand-to- hand combat champion in the entire world! \nShane screams and RIPS THE JOYSTICK OFF THE MACHINE. Sparks fly. Shane looks around to see if the staff noticed. He and the Brownies sneak away, leaving the sizzling machine, its joystick dangling by its wires. \nINT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nZoe's on the phone, the Zhouse is quiet. \nZOE Mom -- stop worrying. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJULIE (ON THE PHONE) I'm a mom, it's my job to worry. \nZOE Seriously, everything's cool. The guy's just a control freak. \nJULIE It's only a few more days. I hate leaving you, but you know I have to do this. I love you. \nZOE I know. Don't worry, we're okay. Tonight I'm just doing homework -- in my cell. \nINT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nAs Zoe hangs up, we WIDEN OUT: The house is PACKED with TEENAGERS: they're keeping quiet until the phone is in its cradle, then the TEENAGE DJ starts the music back up. \nZoe looks around at the mess. She turns to Scott, who doesn't seem concerned at all. \nZOE Dude, this is outta hand. Who are all these people? \nSCOTT Jus' ma peeps. And the folks who read my BLOG. \nZoe rolls her eyes, then notices a WEIRD SWEATY KID, who's throwing mustard covered baloney slices at the ceiling, where they stick with a satisfying SQUISH. \nZOE Dude, not cool... \nVARIOUS SHOTS - The Plummer House: \n- Its a huge party: the place is JAMMED, kids everywhere. \n- Teenagers come and go through the kitchen's DOGGY DOOR. \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT - CONTINUOUS \nShane (Tyler in Snuggle), loads Brownies into the minivan, counting them. Barking at them like Marines: \nSHANE Move, move, move! Go go! \nEXT. SUBURBAN ROAD - MOMENTS LATER \nShane drives, the Brownies are singing 99 Bottles... again. Suddenly, a look of horror comes across Shane's face... he spins the minivan in a 180 and floors it. \nINT. CHUCK E. CHEESE - LATER - DUSK \nShane (Tyler in Snuggle) bursts in, the Brownies follow. We see what he forgot: PETER, still happily playing in the pool of plastic balls. The Manager is watching him. \nMANAGER I figured you'd come back for him -- they almost always do. \nSHANE Inexcusable, to leave a man behind like that... \nMANAGER Relax, we once found a kid in the ball pool when we opened in the morning -- \nShane wades into the ball pool and pulls Peter out, which is fine, except that he's MISSING HIS DIAPER. \nMANAGER (CONT'D) WHOA, Whoa. Not okay, freestyling in the ball pool -- not okay. \nS \nShane grimaces. He holds his breath, and goes down for the diaper. He disappears under the balls -- for a long time. The Manager and the Brownies share a concerned look. He's still down there. Silence. \nLULU Should we send someone in after him? \nZOE You're not my dad! \nShane stops. Lulu and Todd step into the hall. Zoe gets up, shaky and furious, and screams in Shane's face. \nZOE (CONT'D) We hate you, you hate us. You're like a robot. Why don't you just leave us alone? \nSilence. Lulu's crying, Todd picks her up. Shane stands, helpless. After a beat... \nSHANE You're right, Red 1. I'm not the man for this job. \nLULU Shane --! \nSHANE In all my years I have never been treated with such disrespect. Not even from the enemy. Don't worry, as soon as your mom comes back, I'm gone. \nSuddenly -- the power goes out. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Now what? \nZOE (sighs, tired) It's Scott... \nSHANE Puberty... talking doesn't do any good. Go to your rooms. \nSuddenly, TWO NINJAS, all in black BURST in through the window. Shane spins in fight-stance. \nSHANE (CONT'D) (to the kids:) Go! \nTerrified, Zoe and Todd scoop up the kids and rush down the hall. \nThe Ninjas pull a retractable KENDO STAFFS. Wielding them with great skill. It takes all of Shane's skill to fend them off -- the three fight, close-quarters and fast. Until Shane pulls down attic's spring-loaded FOLDING LADDER and clocks a Ninja with it. He goes down, but Shane is SHOCKED from behind by the other NINJA. The Ninjas attack, fiercely -- they're good. Their Kendo staffs hiss with a powerful ELECTRIC CURRENT. The Ninjas knock Shane backwards down the stairs... \nNINJA GHOST -- hand it over! \nThey leap down after him, pounding him with their staffs, knocking him into... \nINT. PLAYROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThere are TOYS EVERYWHERE -- like a tornado hit a TOYS-R- US. Shane fends the Ninjas off. He spots a BASEBALL BAT, and grabs it, facing them, fiercely. They step back... \nSHANE Okay -- who wants some? \nShane swings the bat down on a Ninja's head: It's a whiffle bat, it makes a silly thunk. Shane and the Ninja share a surprised look -- then the Ninjas charge. Shane fends them off with his Whiffle bat. With his foot, he picks up a FISHER PRICE CORN-POPPER, and uses them both to fend off blows. It rattles and pops as he fights with both Toys -- until a Ninja breaks them with one blow. Shane sees a FARMER JOHN TALKING GAME. He jumps up onto a shelf and grabs it. He pulls the string, and swings the plastic disk like a deadly bolo. \nFARMER JOHN GAME The rooster goes... \nWHACK, he hits a Ninja in the head. He swings the Farmer John like a bull whip -- until a Ninja knocks the shelf over. Shane crashes down, toys fly, several FURBIES hit the floor. They echo the fight: \nFURBIES Ow! Ow! \nShane sees: The Ninjas are wearing only Ninja socks -- no shoes. He grabs a barrel of LEGOS, and flings them all over the floor. The Ninjas move towards him -- the Legos and Jacks dig into their feet. \nNINJA/FURBIES Ow! Ow ow! Crap! \nThe Ninjas fight as they hobble around, avoiding Legos, Shane runs to the changing table, then violently squeezes DESITIN at a NINJA, blinding him. \nShane hangs in the doorway and swings at them, KICKING a Ninja in the chest. The Ninja CRASHES through the window! \nhe other Ninja looks up, fearful. Suddenly he grabs a bottle of BABY POWDER. He sprays it in Shane's face... POOF! The room fills with a CLOUD OF WHITE. \nANGLE - SHANE \nHe squints, blinded. The cloud dissipates... and Shane sees he's now alone. He runs to the broken window. \nOUTSIDE: \nThe Ninja's are long gone. Shane bangs the window sill, disappointed to have lost them. \nINT. HALLWAY - SECONDS LATER \nComposing himself, Shane approaches Zoe's door.     He quietly knocks. \nSHANE Kids.   It's safe. You can open up. \nA long pause -- then the door creaks open. The kids run out and hug Shane with all their strength, bawling. Todd and Zoe enter, terrified. Shane isn't sure what to do... Then, he hugs Peter and Lulu. He really hugs them. \nLULU Please don't leave us Shane. \nSHANE I'm not going anywhere. \nHe hugs them, even Zoe is crying and hugging Shane. \nZOE I'm sorry for giving you a hard time. \nSHANE Shhh... It's okay. \nMURNEY That? Lady drivers, what do you expect. No, it's not that -- it's the boy... \nSHANE Red two? I mean Todd? \nClaire nods. Shane gives Zoe a look. Zoe shrugs. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Ordinarily I would wait for his mother to return... but -- I'm a bit concerned, and I'm not sure what to do... \nSHANE Has he been skipping class? \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Well -- yes. He does always miss sixth period. But this... \nMurney calls into the hallway. Todd enters. Shane stops, in shock: Todd's long hair is all shaved off, he now has a bleach blonde BUZZ CUT, giving him a \"skinhead\" look. \nMURNEY This is how he showed up to practice. And that's not all. I was doing a little re- con in his locker... and I found this: \nMurney hands Shane a book and Shane flips through it. It's a book of photographs of NAZI UNIFORMS. Shane scowls. \nMURNEY (CONT'D) If he'd had Hustler or something, boys will be boys -- but this is just sick. \nSHANE He's not a NAZI. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE It's certainly not normal. (pulls Shane aside.) See if you can talk to the boy.   Find out what's going on. \nShane shakes his head: Todd is worse than he thought. Todd and Zoe stand to go, and Shane walks them out. \nThe WRESTLING TEAM is assembled, stretching. They snicker and shake their heads at Todd, as he passes. Shane walks the kids out, and Murney chases after him. \nMURNEY hope you won't go light on him -- that whole family's no good, if you ask me. \nSHANE I'll talk to him. \nMURNEY You're a good man, Shane. Bet you're a hell of a fighter on the mats, huh? (Shane ignores him, and keeps walking.) Maybe sometime we oughta strap up, we'll give these boys a treat. \nHe \"fake-punches\" one of his Boys -- who flinches like Murney has maybe hurt him a couple times. Murney laughs. \nSHANE Another time, maybe... \nMURNEY It's a date then. I'll show you a couple moves. I promise I won't hurt you. \nShane walks away. Without warning, Murney lets out a Kung Fu SCREAM, and leaps at Shane, kicking him in the BACK, Shane trips forwards to his knees. Murney tells his team: \nMURNEY (CONT'D) See that? You never know when your adversary is going to strike! \nSHANE Did you kick me in the back? Is there a footprint on my jacket? \nShane dusts off his back, and leaves. \nMURNEY Come on Frogman! Don't be a sissy! \nShane turns back. It looks like Shane might fight, but instead he takes a deep breath, and leaves. Murney shakes his head, and snickers to his Team. \nEXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - A LITTLE LATER \nThe minivan pulls up, with Shane and all the Plummers piled in. Shane parks, Todd runs towards the house. Shane holds Todd back by the arm. \nSHANE Wait Todd, I want to talk to you... \nodd yanks his arm away and runs into the house. \nINT. TODD'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nShane knocks on Todd's door. Nothing. He enters. The window is wide open, Shane checks his window alarm -- there's a REFRIGERATOR MAGNET stuck to it, keeping the contact, so the alarm didn't go off. \nSHANE Smart kid. \nShane looks out the window -- far down the block, he can see Todd, running around the corner. Shane hops out the window. He sees Zoe, peering out her window. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Zoe, you're in charge. If anyone gets within forty clicks of the perimeter, signal me. Keep all doors sealed, do your homework, preheat the oven, and make sure Lulu brushes her teeth! \nHe starts to shut the window, but the Duck leaps up on the sill. \nSHANE (CONT'D) You want in or out? \nThe Duck leaps out. Shane screws the window shut. On the corner, Shane sees Todd climbing on to a CITY BUS. \nShane picks a GIRL'S BICYCLE up off the front lawn. It's pink, with a flowered basket. It's small for him, but he hops on and pedals furiously after the bus. \nEXT. CITY STREET NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER \nShane, on the girl-bike, pedals after the bus. A few HOMEBOYS watch him pass, curiously. He nods back, tough. \nEXT. OLD WAREHOUSE - DOWNTOWN D.C. - NIGHT - LATER \nThere's some mumbling. Liesl chimes in. \nLIESL We don't have a director... \nShane shakes his head. \nSHANE No director? I have directed rescue missions in Afghanistan! I've directed numerous snatch and grabs in countries who's names you are not allowed to know. I have choreographed multi-pronged amphibious landings and stealth air attacks! (full of bravado) Do you think I have the stomach to whip this production into shape, or not? \nEveryone nods... Todd looks up at Shane. He smiles. \nTODD Yes. \nSHANE YES WHAT? \nTODD/CAST YESSIR. \nINT. PLUMMER HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - LATER \nShane's patrolling the hallway. He hears Zoe in her room, BREAKING something, angrily. He peeks in -- just as Zoe THROWS her cell-phone into the wall, furious. \nSHANE ... What's up? \nZOE (embarrassed) Nothing... It's stupid... Scott. I called him in his room, another girl picked up the phone. I know it's no big deal. I don't know why I let it get to me. \nSHANE I don't see what you see in this guy. \nZOE It's just nice to think someone's thinking about you, you know? S SHANE (He nods) It won't happen again. \nZOE ... No wait! ...What are you gonna do? You're not gonna hurt him are you? Promise you won't touch him. \nSHANE Okay. I promise. I won't touch him. \nShane exits. He turns out the light. \nINT. LULU'S ROOM - LATER \nShane tucks Lulu into bed. \nULU Tell me a story. \nShane looks at her surprised. He sits on the bed... Stumped. Then he starts: \nSHANE Okay. Let's see. Once there was a family of Elves. (MORE) \nT \nS \nL \nSHANE(CONT'D) One day, the little Elf family -- Uh. Went into the magic forest. To find a secret gnome... facility, where gnomes where turning mushrooms into... Uranium. The elves had to go in and take it out. \nULU Why? \nSHANE They were ordered to. By the Elf Unit commander at Elf station bravo. So -- they waited for cloud cover, and they came in from the north... \nAs Shane finishes the story, he illustrates, setting up the scene with DOLLS, on Lulu's floor. \nSHANE (CONT'D) The Elf Team decided on an L Ambush -- so three elves formed a base leg and laid down a heavy suppressive fire on the gnomes while the others maneuvered around to the right flank and walked through finishing off anything left alive... I mean standing...                    D ISSOLVE TO: \nAN HOUR LATER: \nShane's really into the story. Lulu's fallen asleep. Shane's eyes are brimming with tears as he finishes: \nSHANE (CONT'D) ... And not one Elf got left behind that day. We got `em all. Even, the teeniest little elf of all -- Rodriquez. \nThen, from across the hall, Peter WAILS.   Todd pops his head in the door. \nODD You have to do the Panda Dance... or he won't stop. \nSHANE Oh, c'mon... I can't remember that thing. \nTODD I'll write it down for you... \nThe wails get louder and LOUDER... \nS \nINT. NURSERY - CONTINUOUS \nTyler's asleep. Shane sighs, and whispers to Peter, reading from Todd's notes: \nSHANE When you're down and low, lower than the floor. And you ain't got a chance. Don't make a move `til you're in the groove, and do the Panda Dance... \nThe kids instantly freeze. Claire strides into view. She's wearing a cute dress, and a little make-up. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE (CONT'D) (a long, severe stare) Now... WALK! DOUBLE TIME. \nChastened, the kids gulp and orderly march away. Shane's eyes alight, impressed. \nSHANE Wow.   I'm glad I never had you for a CO. \nS \nT \nP \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE (she coyly smiles) I've noticed improvement in your troops lately, too. Noon and none of them have been called to my office. It's a miracle. S he sits beside him, and offers him a milk. \nRINCIPAL CLAIRE (CONT'D) Buy you a drink, sailor? \nSHANE Thanks. \nhey eat in silence. Shane`s not so good at small talk. She's waiting for him to say... something. \nSHANE (CONT'D) You look nice today. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE This old thing? Well, you never know who you're going to run into. \nShe smiles. He smiles back... Suddenly, there's a commotion: Murney is marching Todd towards them, dragging him by the ear. Principal Claire sighs \"not again.\" In one move, Shane leaps over the table. Principal Claire watches him leap: \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE (CONT'D) ... Love it when he does that. \nMurney shoves Todd forward. \nMURNEY I've had it. I just caught this boy dancing under the bleachers like some kind of Bavarian fruitcake. \nMurney gets up in Shane's face. \nMURNEY (CONT'D) I want this freak outta my school and into treatment. Somebody needs to give this punk a talking to... \nTODD Hey. I'm right here. Talk. E veryone is shocked that Todd talked back. A hushed whisper goes through the cafeteria. Murney turns around. \nM \nMURNEY You got something to say? Boy? \nTODD Yeah. Yeah I do. I quit, Murney. \nA hushed \"oooh\" goes through the Students. \nMURNEY Winners never quit, boy. What're you so scared of, Freak? \nThe Students snicker. Todd looks, intimidated. Then: \nTODD I am not scared. I... I want to sing. \nSilence. No one's sure they heard him right. Todd pulls out a stack of SOUND OF MUSIC FLYERS and hands them out. Todd is on the poster in his Rolf costume. Principal Claire takes one: she laughs, now it all makes sense. \nTODD (CONT'D) I'm in Sound of Music. It opens Friday... \nMURNEY A musical? You're blowing off wrestling for a musical? (to Shane:) This is what happens when there's no man in the house. \nTODD There is a man in my house -- me. (Murney turns:) Let's get one thing clear. I'm not quitting cause I hate wresting. I'm quitting because you're a bad coach. You suck. The whole team wants to quit. I'm the only one with the guts to do it. M urney looks over at the Team. They look to the ground sheepishly, Todd's telling the truth. Murney looks around, humiliated, furious -- \nURNEY So -- you're a tough guy now? \nMurney takes ONE STEP towards Todd -- Shane steps between them, protecting him. \nMURNEY (CONT'D) Stay out of this, baby sitter! \nMurney glares at him -- face to face. So calm, it's scary \nS \nSHANE You said you wanted to wrestle. You win. Let's do it. \nEveryone is watching. Murney did not expect to be called out. His voice cracks -- then he regains his calm: \nMURNEY After school. The Gym. Your ass is mine. \nHe storms out. There is a stunned moment -- and then a mob of Students, and a lot of CUTE GIRLS, swarm Todd, taking flyers. Shane gives Todd a proud thumbs up. \nA QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS: Of STUDENTS whispering to other STUDENTS, passing notes: A Kid opens a note -- it reads: \"Murney's getting his ass kicked. 3:00.\" \nINT. GYM - 3:00 \nshe only clips one, it teeters, but doesn't fall. Shane gives her a signal, she throws it in reverse and drives the course backwards. \nEXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - DAY \nLulu, in   her BROWNIE uniform, ties a complicated knot -- we WIDEN   to see she's tying Shane's hands behind his back, as   the Brownie troop watches. He counts \"1,2,3...\" and then   begins wriggling free. They watch closely. \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY \nShane and Zoe are huddled under the minivan's dashboard. Shane's showing her the IGNITION WIRES. \nEXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - BACK YARD - DAY \nShane has the Brownies assembled. He's attached SOFA CUSHIONS to himself. The Brownies attack, mercilessly. \nINT. NURSERY - DAY \nShane changes Tyler's diaper RAPID-SPEED.    Hands a blur. \nINT. OLD FACTORY - NIGHT \nTodd and \"Liesl\" work on the You Are Sixteen dance. \nODD ... your life little girl, is an empty page/that men will want to write on... T odd tries the spinning kick, but blows it, landing hard. Shane blows a WHISTLE. \nSHANE Why don't we just let the Nazis win tonight -- huh? Now. From the top -- think of yourself as a gazelle prancing over the plains. Graceful. \nTodd tries the kick. THUD!    Shane BLOWS the whistle. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Gazelle.   Prancing. Graceful.   Again. \nINT. NURSERY - NIGHT \nAt the end of Peter's crib, Shane performs the \"Panda Dance.\" Singing and doing all the moves -- he's got it down, adding a James Brown flourish, now and then. \nU \nSHANE Don't touch that dial sleep for a while -- HEAAAY! And say good night, Peter Panda. \nHe does a spin kick. Then he tucks Peter in. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Good night, Peter. \nPETER (going to sleep) Good night, daddy. \nShane is so touched, he almost bursts into tears. He kisses Peter on the forehead. \nSHANE I'm not your daddy, Peter. But sweet dreams. \nMONTAGE ENDS \nEXT. \"PRICE CLUB\" STORE - EVENING \nThe Brownies sit at their cookie table beside the door. Across the lot, the Chubby Cub Scouts, at their own table, see them. The Scouts head towards the Brownies. U GLY CUB SCOUT Hey Skeever, what's in a Girl Scout's pants when she has diarrhea? \n2ND SCOUT Brown... \nHe stops short, the Brownies have moved into a FORMATION, ready to strike, Lulu at the front: it's (kind of) scary. \nLULU Go away and we won't hurt you. \nThe Scouts share a look -- they LAUGH. The head Scout steps forward and grabs Lulu's cookies. In one move, she spins out of the way and pulls off his neckerchief. \nGLY CUB SCOUT Gimme that! \nHe grabs the neckerchief, but like lightning, she wraps it around his arm, tying him. She shoves a cookie in his mouth. \nLULU Uh oh. You're gonna have to pay for that. \nThe Scout struggles, the Other Scouts are scared. \nUGLY CUB SCOUT Let go! Let go -- MOMMY! \nShe lets him go -- in a FLIP, he lands on the ground hard. Lulu lets out another \"kia!\" The Girls move forward in unison, striking a cool pose. \nINT. \"PRICE CLUB\" STORE - CONTINUOUS \nShane shops, wearing the double snuggle. As he's comparing prices -- he sees, on the security monitor: The Brownies attacking the Cub Scouts. He smiles, proud. S SHANE That's my troop. \nEXT. \"PRICE CLUB\" STORE - A MOMENT LATER \nThe Cub Scouts have all been tied with their own bandanas to the CART CORRAL. Shane comes out of the store, and catches Lulu, using his \"catchphrase.\" \nLULU From now on, you do things our way -- no highway option! \nJ INT. HOTEL - CONTINUOUS \nulie's on the other end. \nJULIE The red tape is cleared up, we're on the first plane in the morning. \nINT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nZoe runs down the hall, telling the family: \nZOE Mommy's coming home! Mommy's coming home! \nEveryone wakes up, happy, sleepy! \nTODD When? \nZOE Tomorrow morning! \nPETER Mama! \nExcited, the kids are all abuzz, talking excitedly. \nANGLE - SHANE \nHe's left alone. \nEXT. BACK YARD - LATE NIGHT \nThe house is dark. Shane sits in a lawn chair, scoping the area with NIGHT VISION GOGGLES ON. Gary sits in the next chair. Shane sighs morosely. \nSHANE Just another assignment. No reason for personal attachments. \nShane takes a sip out of a juice box. He pets the Duck. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Hey Gary, your wings aren't clipped. How come you don't fly away? (pause) (MORE) \nT \nS \nS \nS \nT \nSHANE(CONT'D) I guess you've got it good.    Kids to play with. Three squares a day. \nhe Duck stares, unblinking. \nSHANE (CONT'D) All quiet on the western front. I guess I better fix that Playroom window. S hane rises. \nINT. GARAGE - NIGHT \nhane turns the light on. Gary follows Shane as he looks for tool. Suddenly, the Duck starts quacking... Shane turns. Gary's foot is caught in a grate. \nSHANE What happened, Gary? \nShane gets down on his hands and knees and gently pries Gary's foot from the grate. Shane is about to stand when something below catches his eye. \nShane pulls out a pen flashlight, shines it down the grate... we see a CRANK WHEEL. \nSHANE (CONT'D) What do you suppose this is? \nShane tugs at the grate until it pops off. Shane grips the valve and tries turning it. Nothing. He tries harder, muscles rippling, and then it gives... The wheel spins. \nhe floor opens, revealing a CIRCULAR STAIRCASE, leading below the garage. Shane steps down it... \nINT. BOTTOM OF STAIRS - CONTINUOUS \nThere's a small room, and a hall leading to a STEEL DOOR. It's solid and inscrutable. No hinges or cracks. The only break in its surface is a strange, TWO-PRONGED KEYHOLE. Shane looks on stunned... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GARAGE - MORNING \nShane's at the Steel Door. He has high-tech tools laid out in front of him. He's been trying, unsuccessfully, to crack the lock all night. The Kids are watching his progress, Lulu hands him a tool. Shane dials a phone. \nINTERCUT: \nB \nS \nShane leads Bill inside. Bill holds the pronged key. \nILL I'm really proud of you, Shane. I'm giving you your choice of assignment, anywhere you want. You just name it. \nSHANE That's kind of you, Sir... pause) But I'll have to think about it. \nBill stops, surprised.   Shane continues, a bit reluctant. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Sir, all I've never known is the military. At nine years old my father put me in cadet school and from there I never looked back. Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't trade it for anything and I have no regrets... \nS \nS \nBILL I should hope not. \nSHANE But being with these kids has made me feel like there's more to life than taking out your enemy. And I think I want to explore that some more. \nSuddenly, an ANGRY VOICE. \nMAN'S VOICE PUT YOUR HANDS UP!! \nWIDE \nShane and Bill spin, startled.    The CHUNS strides up, GUNS DRAWN. \nMRS. CHUN Give US THE KEY! \nSHANE Mr. and Mrs. Chun?     They checked out- \nKOREAN MAN H ands up! \nCompliant, Shane puts his hands behind his head. He takes a submissive position... Mrs. Chun comes closer, reaching for Bill's key... Shane shoots Bill a glance... \nSHANE NOW! \nShane SPINS and grabs both guns! He WHACKS the Koreans' forearms, while SLAMMING their heads together. \nhane takes control! He smiles, relishing a second of glory -- when suddenly, CRACK! A third gun BUTTS him in the head. \nCLOSE-UP - SHANE \nLights out. He turns, startled, and starts to fall. Disoriented, confused, he looks up as he drops... \nSHANE'S POV \nHe is losing consciousness. Things are spinning... woozy. \nB \nKOREAN MAN (arguing with Bill) You promised us GHOST months ago! \nBILL I'm sorry, Mr. Chun. There were delays... \nShane peers in confusion, then passes out. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. NURSERY - MOMENTS LATER \nJulie and the Kids are on the floor, tied up. Peter and Tyler are caged in the play pen. Peter has a JUICE BOX. The Korean Man (Mr. Chun) secures the room, closing the window shades. Bill checks the knots binding the children. They whimper, scared. L ULU SHANE!! \nBILL He won't be baby-sitting you anymore. \nHe GAGS the kids.    Julie glares, livid. \nJULIE I trusted you. Charles trusted you. So did the Department of Defense. \nILL North Korea pays better. (to Mr. Chun) Keep an eye on them. You -- with me. \nBill GAGS Julie. The Kids are furious. Bill and Mrs. Chun exit. \nINT. GARAGE - DAY \nShane lies unconscious. Bill and Mrs. Chun approach the steel door. Bill inserts the two-pronged key... and it CLICKS. The door HUMS, then slides OPEN! \nInside is a dark corridor.      Bill grins.   They enter... \nINT. SECRET VAULT \nLight is at the end.    They anxiously tiptoe, reaching... \nJULIE AGGGH! \nShe SCREAMS. Bill lurches into view, clutching her! The kids are horrified. They start to run back, but she urgently gestures -- \nJULIE (CONT'D) Keep going!     RUN! Go GET HELP!!! \nThe kids fret, unsure, then nod and run to the side garage. Zoe and Todd load the kids into the minivan. \nZOE/TODD Hurry!   C'mon! Buckle up!! \nINT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nBill pulls Julie inside. Mrs. Chun listens to Mr. Chun ON THE RADIO, speaking in Korean: \nRS. CHUN They're headed for the car! \nBILL Relax -- I've got the keys, they're not going anywhere... \nINT. MINIVAN - CONTINUOUS \nSPARKS FLY as Zoe hot-wires the minivan. She floors it... \nEXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nr. Chun comes racing around the house -- as SCREEEECH! The van suddenly FLOORS out, almost clipping him! \nZ \nZ \nMR. CHUN ARGHH! \nChun falls, as the van PEELS backwards down the driveway, and 360's. RRRR! It shifts into drive and ROARS away. Chun hops into Bill's car and races after them. \nINT. VAN - CONTINUOUS \nZoe floors it. \nOE Omigod!   What are we doing??! \nTODD Let's look for a cop! \nWIDE \nThe sedan GUNS its engine, gaining on them. \noe runs a yellow. She hits the curb and goes AIRBORNE. WHOOOOOO! The kids SCREAM, as they sail through the intersection! The sedan keeps chasing. \nINT. GARAGE - SAME TIME \nBill has Julie at gunpoint, leading her to the secret door. They step past Shane's body, lying on the concrete. \nBILL How does it work? \nJULIE How does what work? \nBILL Don't play dumb. It's getting old. I want to know how to get through the booby traps. What's the code? \nJULIE I don't know any code -- Charles didn't tell me about the room... \nBILL If I knew Charles had hidden it so well, I wouldn't have killed him so soon. Don't make me kill you too. \nJulie GASPS, chilled. Then, a CRACKLING of static.    Mrs. Chun exits the vault, holding a military RADIO. \nB \nMRS. CHUN Mr. Bill, my husband has question: \nMR. CHUN (OVER THE WALKIE) I have a clean shot at their tires. It's B risky, they might wreck... \nILL ... Do it. \nJULIE NO! \nJulie goes frantic, emotional. \nSHANE (O.S.) Bill, don't hurt the kids. \nSurprised, everyone looks down. \nANGLE - SHANE \nThey look over -- Shane is standing in the doorway. \nShane LAUGHS sharply. That's the code! He shares a look with Julie. Bill and Julie share a look -- they have no idea what he's laughing about. \nCalmness comes to Shane's face. He takes a deep breath, S facing forwards: \nSHANE (CONT'D) Just hop three times like a kangaroo -- \nHe hops forwards three times, fearlessly. NOTHING HAPPENS. No BOOBY TRAPS are set off. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Sidestep twice, just like the crabs do. \nHe steps sideway, across two tiles. Again -- NOTHING HAPPENS. It dawns on Julie what he's doing. Julie smiles, relieved. Shane he steps forwards, then back: \nSHANE (CONT'D) Three steps forward and one step back. \nWhen he steps back -- A SPRING-LOADED SPIKE launches down from the ceiling, imbedding itself where he was standing. Shane is rattled, his focus gone. Until Julie shouts: \nJULIE QUICK LIKE A TURTLE LIE ON YOUR BACK! \nShane snaps out of it and flops down on his back -- just in time: FLAMES SHOOT FROM BOTH WALLS right at him. If he'd been standing, he'd be toast. \nEXT. BUSY INTERSECTION - SIMULTANEOUS \nThe Minivan blasts through another yellow. \nLULU Look out Zoe! Rollers! \nThere is a POLICE CAR cruising the street ahead of them. Zoe blows past it. Inside is the Cute Cop. The Squad Car's lights flash on, and he catches up with the minivan -- it takes a while, they're FLYING. \nZOE Come on. Use the gas, not the brake, 5-0. \nZoe slows down so the Police Car can pull up beside her. The Cute Cop shouts over at Zoe. \nCUTE COP I'd say you could lose your license -- but you haven't got one! \nZOE People are trying to kill us. They have my mom, and our bodyguard -- you have to follow me! \nCUTE COP Just pull over! \nZOE Fine. Don't follow me! \nShe swerves into the Squad Car, almost running it off the road. Zoe U-turns, and speeds back towards her house. The Squad Car turns around and chases her. \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MOMENTS LATER \nThe Minivan speeds by. The Squad Car is on its tail. It is joined by MORE SQUAD CARS. Following the chase, at a safe distance, is Mr. Chun in his now-wrecked sedan. \nEXT. SCHOOL - SAME TIME \nMurney and Claire are watching a SOCCER GAME.   He's in a NECK-BRACE. \nMURNEY That Baloney Bandit struck again. I accept full responsibility. My intelligence proved to be faulty, but if I had more resources... \nShe shakes her head, Suddenly, the Minivan SPEEDS by. VROOOOM! Then the Police Car CHASES by. VROOOM!! Then -- FIVE MORE POLICE CARS ZOOM BY. VROOOOOOM!!! \nMURNEY (CONT'D) (not that surprised:) I told you not to pass her in Driver's Ed. \nClaire frowns, concerned... \nINT. PLUMMER BASEMENT - CONTINUOUS \nShane is on the floor, sliding forward, nervously. \nSHANE Wriggle like a snake `til you can't no more. Then better jump quick, like there ain't no floor. \nShane jumps up just AS THE FLOOR UNDER HIM DROPS AWAY, revealing a pool of liquid. Shane has wedged himself in the corner. A bead of his sweat falls into the liquid, and sizzles in a cloud of smoke. It's acid. \nSHANE (CONT'D) (to himself, to calm down) Almost done, almost done... \"Just hold your breath, and jump to the left.\" \nHe jumps, to the left of the HOLE. He lands in front of THE SAFE. He's relieved -- then nozzles spray YELLOW GAS at him. He holds his breath just in time. Still holding his breath: \nSHANE (CONT'D) And that's the Peter Panda Dance. \nHe flips the switch to DISARMED. The safe's red light turns green. Immediately, the flamethrowers and blowguns retract! The gas gets sucked into grates. The whole room goes SILENT. Whew. \nBill looks around. He nervously steps forward - he waves his hand over the floor, and jumps back. Nothing happens. \nBill signals for Mrs. Chun to go first. She gestures back: you go. It's a stand-off. Finally, Bill takes a breath -- and walks across the room. The Booby Traps are disarmed. Mrs. Chun follows, pulling Julie along. \nBILL Thank you, Shane. You were always my best man. I knew you'd figure it out. \nShane scowls, disgusted. \nBILL (CONT'D) You know, if you're willing to join up, I'd be happy to cut you in on the proceeds. What do you say -- we make a good team? \nInside, the cavernous metal box holds but one object: A tiny COMPUTER CHIP. Shane gently removes it. \nSHANE ... GHOST. \nThey look in silence. She smiles at Shane, grateful. \nJULIE Thank you Shane. It's finally over. Now we can go back to our peaceful... \nThen -- a sudden AMPLIFIED VOICE from behind them: \nULLHORN (V.O.) FREEZE! HOLD IT RIGHT THERE! \nEXT. HOUSE - SAME TIME \nTotal commotion. The kids clamber from the van, with their hands raised. Cops surround them. Even Peter and Tyler have their little hands over their heads.   The garage door raises, Shane steps out. \nSHANE Whoa, WHOA!    What are you doing to these kids?? \nCUTE COP FREEZE. HANDS WHERE I CAN SEE THEM. \nCops cover Shane and Julie, Julie and Shane Freeze. \nZOE But, officer... \nCUTE COP I said FREEZE. Zoe, you're in a lot of trouble... Reckless endangerment! Driving without a license. Numerous, uh... trafficS violations -- \nSHANE (cutting him off) These kids are heroes. They just aided in exposing a high-level espionage ring. I suggest you call the FBI. Now. \nSilence. The Cops are unsure what to do. He scoffs. \nCUTE COP You expect me to believe any of that? \nSuddenly -- a CRAZED SCREAM. \nMR. CHUN (O.S.) EVERYBODY!   HIT THE GROUND!!! \nWIDE \nEveryone spins. Mr. Chun stands inside the gate, pointing a ROCKET LAUNCHER. He's disheveled and manic. \nMR. CHUN (CONT'D) I WANT THE GHOST, TEN MILLION DOLLARS, AND A DIRECT FLIGHT TO PYONGYANG! \nThe cops freeze, helpless. Shane weighs his not so many options... Nobody is sure what to do. \nBut then -- a WOMAN suddenly flips over the fence, vaults onto Chun, and KNOCKS him out with a Karate Chop. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Ya!! \nClaire lands on her feet, triumphant. Even Chun is amazed, as he turns his head, Shane spins, and grabs the rocket launcher. \nCLOSE-UP - SHANE \nHe breaks into a big grin. \nCLOSE-UP - CLAIRE \nShe proudly smiles back at him. \nANGLE - THE CUTE COP \nHe's flummoxed. This chaos is unsolvable.    Beaten, he reaches for his radio. \nCOP I think I'll call the FBI. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LATER \nF.B.I. AGENTS swarm the area. Bill and the Chuns are being hauled away in cuffs. Julie huddles with the kids. Shane talks with an F.B.I. Agent. F .B.I. AGENT Mr. Wolfe... that was nice work.   You're a one-man battalion. \nSHANE Just doing my job. \nF.B.I. AGENT The Bureau is always looking for good men. Do you have a card or something? \nThe Agent hands him a BUSINESS CARD, then walks off. Shane examines it, swelling with pride. \nINT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS \nThe Kids are looking around, watching the FBI Agents work. Lulu is following one of the FBI Agents around. \nLULU Do you have to wear that thing in your ear all the time? \nFBI AGENT Yes. \n", "test1_input": "THE PACIFIER \nWritten by \nThomas Lennon & Robert Ben Garant \nPrevious Revisions by \nJason Fulardi, Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewki \nMarch 3rd, 2004 \nFADE IN: \nEXT.

SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS \nThe HELICOPTER PILOT weighs in. \nPILOT All clear from above. \nEXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS \nThe camera descends as the boat passes, and dives beneath the surface. \nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS \nThe droning of engines becomes less pronounced. Foam from the boat and skis bubbles. \nCalm. Then from out of nowhere five NAVY SEALs wearing RE- BREATHERS appear, in neat formation like the Blue Angels. JET PROPELLED BACKPACKS push the SEALs through the water. \nThe LEAD SEAL: SHANE WOLFE, points upwards. All eyes follow his finger to the underbelly of the boat above. From his belt, Shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and FIRES. A cable shoots up -- THUD... The disc sticks to the boat's hull. Shane pushes a button on the wand retracting the cable and drawing himself closer. \nDangling from the cruiser, Shane fixes a BOMB to the hull. He releases himself from the boat and speeds away -- \nBOOM. A dense explosion sends ripples through the water and ELECTRICITY crackling around the boat. \nINT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS \nA SURGE of ELECTRICAL FORCE blasts from the control panel. SPARKS fly. \nThe two Serbian Men jolt backwards -- WHAM -- and hit the wall. All the needles inside all the dials go LIMP. The roar of the engines DIES and the boat STOPS. \nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN, UNDER THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS \nShane slips inside the hull, through the new hole. \nINT. SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS \nThe chopper slows to a hover.   The Pilot looks below. \nPILOT What's happening? \nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS \nThe jet skiers protectively circle the injured boat in a SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING move, and the Jet Ski drivers are simultaneously YANKED below the surface: a split second later they're replaced by our SEALS (ALSO IN BLACK WET SUITS AND GOGGLES) -- the switch happens in less than a second, way too fast for anyone to notice. \nINT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS \nThe shaken Serbs climb to their feet. \nSERBIAN 2 What happened? \nThey look around, and see the SEALS, on the jet skis: In the masks they are indistinguishable from the GUN-TOTTING MEN they switched paces with. All seems clear. Serb 1 pushes on the throttle... nothing. \nSERBIAN 1 We've been hit. We're taking on water. \nSuddenly the boat lists -- and water pours in, under the cabin door. They spring into action! \nSERBIAN 1 (CONT'D) Grab the professor, quick! \n", "test1_true": "Serb 1 rushes out, shouting orders: He alerts four ARMED GUARDS and the Jet Ski drivers (now our Seals). \nSERBIAN 1 Something must be below us! Shoot! Shoot! \nThe Armed Guards fire relentlessly into the water. Serb 2 rushes below deck. \nINT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS \nPROFESSOR CHARLES PLUMMER, bound to a chair and gagged, tries to YELP as the room begins to flood with water. \nINT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS \nSerb 2 runs down steps to the lowermost hold. He tries to force the door open. When it finally opens, he is forced back by a three foot wall of water. \nINT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS \nProfessor Plummer panics, as the water rises up to his mouth He struggles, but can't get free. Up to his nose, over his head.... He's gone. \nThen Shane Wolf rises out of the water, hauling the Professor up. He cuts the Professor's GAG. Plummer screams. Shane removes his mouth piece. Shane doesn't seem the slightest bit fazed by the circumstances. \nSHANE Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States Navy. I'm gonna get you outta here. But you have to do exactly what I say, when I say it. My way -- no highway option. Do you copy? (Plummer nods, terrified.) Where's the briefcase? \nThe Professor gestures across the room, where a metal BRIEFCASE is floating. Shane calmly HANDCUFFS it to his own waist. As the water rises, to the roof. \nPLUMMER How did you know where I... \nShane sticks the mouth piece into Plummer's mouth, giving him his oxygen. \nEXT. ON THE DECK - SIMULTANEOUS \nThe Armed Guards stop shooting into the water. One of our SEALS calls out to them, in PERFECT SERBIAN: \nSEAL KEEP SHOOTING! \nThe Guards fire again. The SEAL speaks into his neck mic. \nSEAL (CONT'D) Give it a second, they're almost out of ammo. \nThe Seal calls out: \"shoot more, more!\" They do, until there's nothing but empty CLICKS from their guns. \nSEAL (CONT'D) Now Lieutenant. Chopper's four meters at your 10 o'clock. \nINT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS \nJust before the water envelopes him and Plummer... \nSHANE (into his mic) I've got the Prof and the case. First round's on me back at Virginia Beach. \nShane takes a deep breath, and pulls himself, the Professor and the briefcase UNDER the water. \nEXT. OCEAN'S SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER \nShane and the Professor rise to the surface as the boat falters behind them. Shane pulls out a retractable CROSSBOW. It clicks open and he shoots a CABLE into the belly of the helicopter above him. \nSHANE Hold on. \nINT. HELICOPTER - A SECOND LATER \nShane appears at the Pilot's door, holding the Professor. Shane addresses the Pilot in perfect SERBIAN. \nSHANE You know how to swim? \nThe Pilot nods, terrified. Shane TOSSES the Pilot out. \nShane swings into the hot seat and grabs the controls, pulling the Professor in behind him. \nON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER - CONTINUOUS \nThe SEALS on the Jet Skis SALUTE Shane in the chopper, then disappear gracefully back into the water. \nINT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS \nShane smiles, clearly he loves this kind of day. He looks beside him, the Professor looks terrified. The Professor takes out his mouth piece. \nPLUMMER Oh my God. I can't believe you... how'd we... That was the most incredible... \nShane sticks the mouth piece back in the Professors' mouth, shutting him up. \nSHANE Better keep that on `til we get to the rendezvous point. \nPLUMMER (through the mouth piece) Why? Poison gas? \nSHANE (re: the oxygen) No. I'm just not big on chit chat. \n", "test2_input": "The car speeds out of the drive, backwards at sixty m.p.h.. It does a skidding 180 and heads down the street. \nEXT. EAST BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - 9:29 A.M. \nA big suburban school, Busses and PARENTS are parked at the curb, STUDENTS of all ages are hurrying inside. The Minivan skids completely sideways, into a TINY parking spot -- a death defying, perfect parallel park. \nINT. PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER \nCLOSE UP ON: a stopwatch. It hits ZERO, and at that moment, the SCHOOL'S BELL RINGS. \nHolding the stopwatch is the VICE PRINCIPAL MURNEY (50's). He's HUGE and mean. \nMURNEY I always said these kids didn't need a baby sitter, they needed a parole officer. Looks like Mrs. Plummer finally listened. \nHe glares at Shane, and the Kids: Shane sits with Tyler in a Snuggle, holding Peter on a harness, as he plays on the floor. The Kids are seated around him, mortified. \nMURNEY (CONT'D) (To Shane) What's your name, son? \nSHANE Wolfe. Shane. Lieutenant. I'm in charge of watching these kids for... a few days. \nMurney is unimpressed. \nMURNEY aby-sitter huh. Well, whatever work you can get. I'm Murphy. Duane. V.P in charge of discipline, conduct and truancy. Top to bottom, K thru 12. You're in my house now, boy. I coach wrestling, too. (re: Todd:) And the creeper here played hookey from every wrestling practice this month. \nThe Kids crack up. Murney is furious. \nMURNEY (CONT'D) She's missed twenty-two Driver's Ed classes. Out of twenty-three. They're the worst students in my school. \nOMAN'S VOICE Your school? \nMurney grimaces as PRINCIPAL CLAIRE NELSON (early 30's) enters. She's attractive, assured, tough. He withers. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Good morning kids. What are you doing in my office, Murney? \nMURNEY I was explaining, that as vice principal, I am in charge of.... \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Very little. I thought I asked you to find out who stuck to the baloney slices to the cafeteria ceiling with mustard? \nMURNEY I'm got some leads. (then, confidential:) My informant's about to crack. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Then hop to it. I think I can handle this from here. \nThe opens the door for Murney. He exits, fuming.     The BELL rings. \nSHANE Red 1, Red 2. Get moving. \nThe teens hustle off to their classes. Shane checks his TRACKER -- two little red DOTS move away. Good. \nPrincipal Claire eyeballs him... staring him up and down, as he casually holds the three kids. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE So. You're the new baby-sitter? \nSHANE Bodyguard. You see, Mrs. Plummer called my captain, she thought the kids needed - \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE It's okay, Lieutenant, I was briefed of the situation by Mrs. Plummer. She told me all about you. \nShe notices NAVY SEAL tattoo on his upper arm. Claire sees this -- and suddenly reacts, impressed. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE (CONT'D) Lieutenant, huh? You with \"The Teams?\" (Shane nods.) Petty Officer Third Class Claire Nelson at your service. \nSHANE ... You're kidding? \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Four years at Naval base Coronado.   The Service paid for my college. \nShane stares not sure whether to believe. On the spot, Claire looks nervously around. She lifts her pants leg... revealing a tiny ANCHOR TATTOO on her ankle. \nSHANE \"Honor, Courage... \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Commitment\". That's the way I live my life, and the way I run my school. \nSHANE Can't be too careful. So. Permission to stick around and keep eyes on the kids? \nShe smiles. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Permission granted. Welcome aboard. Just try not to frighten the children. \nSHANE No one will even notice I'm here. \nJUMP CUT TO: \nEXT. EAST BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - MID-MORNING \nShane, dead serious, (Tyler in Snuggle) is riding the see- saw in the school's playground. Peter rides on the other side with a group of KIDS, to balance Shane. Shane types on his laptop: CLAIRE NELSON. A picture of Claire in a Naval uniform pops up as well as her stats... \n", "test2_true": "Shane closes the computer, picks up a pair of binoculars. \nBINOCULARS P.O.V. as Shane goes from window to window of the school: Zoe is glaring at him through the window from her seat in a class. Todd, sitting in the back row of a class, yanks his hood over his head. Lulu waves from 2nd Grade, delighted. \nAlong line of FIRST GRADERS wait for the seesaw. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Back off. Official Business. \nON THE PLAYGROUND: \nShane stands with his Baby snuggle. Peter is running in circles around him on his harness, like a tether ball. He checks his tracking device... \nINT. CAFETERIA - LUNCH TIME \nBINOCULARS P.O.V.: Five hundred students eat at long tables. Zoe, with a group of HIP FRIENDS, turns her back to him embarrassed. Todd, in line to get lunch, does the same. Lulu sees Shane and waves. \nShane puts down his binoculars. He turns to the person in front of him, with stern intensity. \nSHANE Give up now. Save us both a world of pain. Now -- last time: Open the hanger, Black Hawk coming in. \nReveal: Shane is talking to Tyler, in his safety seat -- trying to get him to eat. Beside Shane, Peter is destroying a sandwich with animal crackers. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Open in T minus three, two, one... \nTyler gurgles, ignoring him. Shane sighs. Principal Claire sits next to Shane with her lunch tray. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE What would you say is the secret with kids, Mr. Wolfe? \nSHANE Show no weakness. \nRINCIPAL CLAIRE I'll drink to that. (she toasts, with milk.) Shane... Can I call you Shane? \nSHANE ... Sure. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE So. When you agreed to serve your country, I bet you didn't know you'd be serving creamed bananas to one year olds, huh? \nShane gives her a look. Principal Claire smiles. \nSHANE Hey -- I out rank you, you know. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Not here, you don't. You're on dry land, lieutenant. (she looks at his chair) Well, not so dry where you're sitting, I guess. \nShane sees that Tyler is pouring his juice Box all over Shane's pants. He yanks Tyler away from him. \nSHANE Oh, man... \nTyler starts to cry -- but Shane stops him from crying by making a funny face. Tyler laughs. Claire smiles. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Don't take this personally -- but you're pretty good at this. Seriously, I'm impressed. A whole day, and all three Plummer's stayed out of trouble. That's... unusual. \nSuddenly there's a huge crash around the corner, and the sound of Students in an uproar. Shane hands Tyler off to the Principal and leaps over the table... \nINT. LUNCH-LINE - CONTINUOUS \nStudents are in a ring, cheering, as four STUDENTS in Wrestling Jackets hold Todd. One reaches down and gives Todd a \"wedgy\" then another WRESTLER punches him. Todd slips out of their hold and decks the Wrestler. VP Murney is watching, but not stopping it. Zoe, in the crowd, cheers Todd on: \nZOE Kick his butt, Todd! \nShane and Claire push through the Students. As soon as they see the Principal, the crowd freezes. \nRINCIPAL CLAIRE Who started this? \nSilence. Then vice principal Murney steps forward. \nMURNEY He did. (Todd) \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Todd started a fight with five students at once? \nShane turns to Todd, and \"punches fists\" with him, impressed. \nMURNEY The kid's mixed up. Look at him. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE If I catch anyone on the team fighting again, next week's tournament is off. I don't care who starts it. \nMurney smirks, and gives her a \"I'll handle it\" wink. \nMURNEY You heard the lady. Any more fighting and there'll be no more wrestling. Personally I think that's a little harsh. Boys'll be boys. (low, to Todd:) `Scept for Plummer here. \nTodd lunges at him. Shane effortlessly grabs Todd and Judo FLIPS HIM -- Todd lands on his feet, sticking the landing. No one is more Ssurprised than Todd and Shane. \nSHANE ... Nice moves, man. \nThe Bell rings, the crowd breaks up. Murney approaches Shane. \n", "test3_input": "MURNEY Pretty slick, Frogman -- I'm a black belt myself. S'why they asked me to coach the wrestling team. \nMurney makes a loud Kung Fu CRY and throws a punch, stopping an inch from Shane's head. Shane doesn't flinch. \nMURNEY (CONT'D) See -- total control. Maybe you could stop by practice, we'd show the boys how a couple of pros do it, what do you say? Come on, promise I'll go easy on you. \nSHANE ... Sorry, sir. I'm on duty. \nMURNEY Oh, yeah. That's right. I forgot you had to baby-sit. Maybe some other time then. \nShane puts an arm over Todd's shoulder. Todd shakes him off and heads to class. Murney snickers to Claire: \nMURNEY (CONT'D) Looks like pretty boy there's all bark and no bite. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE ... Don't even think it, Murney. He'd kill you so fast, I wouldn't even have time to get my camera. \nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - 2:55 \nShane looks exhausted. Peter is asleep in his shoulder, Tyler is crying, as he keeps watch. The Principal strolls up. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Another day, another dollar twenty, minus taxes... aren't you gonna change him? \nSHANE I'd love to, for one who'll eat, and not cry. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE That's not what I mean, Lt. \nThen Shane smells what she means -- Tyler's diaper is full. Shane recoils in disgust, holding Tyler out like a grenade. \nSHANE Oh -- change him. Roger that. Uh... \nPanicked, he pushes Tyler towards the Principal. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Sirnosir. Not my job. \nSHANE But... \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Instructions are right on the box. Bathroom's down the hall. Have fun. \nJust then, an alarm in his Jacket GOES OFF. He looks at his tracker: it's flashing RED 3 RED 3. Shane hands off Peter and Tyler to the Principal. \nSHANE Emergency! \nINT. 2ND GRADE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nShane runs down the hall, following his tracking device. It leads him to a door. He bursts though it, doing a shoulder roll. \nINT. 2ND GRADE CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS \n2ND GRADERS are sitting on the floor. Lulu is in front of the class, with the Panic Button in her hand. The board reads: SHOW AND TELL. Shane lands in fight stance -- the Class applauds. Next to Lulu is a very upstaged LITTLE BOY with a FROG. Lulu sticks her tongue out at him. \nLULU See! My nanny can kick your nanny's butt. \nShane is furious, but the FINAL BELL rings. At that moment, his Tracker Alarm sounds again. He looks: \nCLOSE-UP ON THE TRACKER SCREEN: Two DOTS labeled RED 1 and RED 2, are heading away from the school fast. I INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nShane runs with Lulu through the mob of Kids. He hands her to the Principal. \nSHANE Thanks. \nEXT. EAST BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS \nShane dives into the Minivan. The DOTS on the tracker are headed North. He speeds away after them. \nEXT. BUSY INTERSECTION - MOMENTS LATER \nThe BLINKING DOTS on his tracker are side by side, racing down the road ahead of Shane. They make a sharp right. Shane makes a right, almost tipping the minivan. He blasts through a red light. \nEXT. IN FRONT OF A CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER \nHe turns a corner -- a PLYWOOD WALL surrounds the site. He leaps out of the minivan. He looks at the tracker: Zoe and Todd are dead ahead, through the fence. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS \nTwo BIG CONSTRUCTION workers are standing on the other side of the plywood wall -- Shane KICKS out one entire section, and charges through. \nCONSTRUCTION WORKER What hell do you think you're doing? \nHe turns around, to see several CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, all brandishing tools. \nSHANE Tell me where the kids are and I'll let you all live! \nCONSTRUCTION WORKER Buddy, you're about to get a beat down. \n", "test3_true": "ANGLE - SHANE \nHe's alone. He catches his breath, then checks his tracker. Todd and Zoe's BEEPS are coming from a MANHOLE. \nShane pries off the manhole cover.    He looks down. \nIN THE MANHOLE - It's dark and dank. \nNo sweat. Shane lowers himself down. \nINT. SEWER - SAME TIME \nShane lands shoulder deep in DISGUSTING SLUDGE. He winces, then checks the tracker -- the DOTS are CLOSE, feet away. Shane trudges through the river of muck. \nSHANE Red 1?   Red 2? \nIt's horrific. The DOTS BEEP LOUDER. He's almost there! He splashes around a corner -- then gasps -- he sees the blinking lights below the surface. He takes a deep breath and dives under. He comes up for air with ZOE and TODD'S HOMING BEACONS. A note is tied to them: \"Ha! Ha!\" \nINT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER \nPrincipal Claire sits with the Kids in the living room. From outside, they hear the front door open, and the sound of OMINOUS, SQUISHY footsteps. \nThen the door swings open, revealing Shane, looking like a Swamp Creature. Everyone gasps, then covers their noses. A CUTE YOUNG COP enters behind Shane. Todd stiffens. Zoe fixes her hair. The Cop looks at them. \nCUTE COP 14 year old Male, weird hair. 16 year old female. Ditto. (into his radio:) Cancel that a.p.b.. \nThe Cop turns to Shane, with a smirk. \nCUTE COP (CONT'D) In the future, use our nonemergency number. That's the one to call if nobody's fleein' or bleedin'. \nThe Cop leaves, Zoe checks him out as he goes... \nCLAIRE Shane are you okay? \nSHANE (eerily calm:) Just fine, thank you. \nCovering her nose. The smell is BAD. \nCLAIRE I should probably get going then. If you need anymore help... Call. \nShe practically GAGS as she passes him. Shane looks around at Scott and Zoe, he doesn't say anything, but with his hand he makes a \"my eyes on you\" gesture. \nINT. BATHROOM - LATER \nShane is in the shower. He pours an entire bottle of SHAMPOO over himself. \nINT. BACK YARD - DAY \nShane BURNS his clothes in the barbecue. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATER \nTyler is in a high-chair, Peter rocks in a cradle-swing. \nShane enters, in just a towel. He sees on the fridge; Helga'S SHOPPING LIST -- all junk food. He looks at it, cringing in disgust, before he notices: \nSitting around the table are Lulu's entire BROWNIE TROOP - - a dozen little girls in uniforms, they're staring at him. The Brownies applaud, and whistle. \nBROWNIE oo hoo! Hubba hubba! \nShane covers up and leaps into the Family Room, pulling Lulu after him. \nINT. FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSHANE Who are those people? \nLULU It's my troop, it's Monday. Monday, Wednesday and Saturday are troop nights. \nSHANE (O.S.) Get rid of them. \nLULU I can't. Everybody's parents go out on troop nights. They won't be home `til ten. Mom's our den mother. \nLulu starts to sniffle, close to tears. \nLULU (CONT'D) Tonight we're supposed to sell cookies. \nSHANE Selling cookies isn't imperative to my mission. \nLULU We have to. If we don't sell enough cookies, we can't go the Jamboree, and if we can't go to the Jamboree. (whispers:) Come on, Shane. You gotta help me out. They already think I'm a loser. And it's not like I have any other friends, cause mom never lets me out of her sight... \nLulu's about to burst into tears. Shane sighs. \nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \n"}

{"test1_input": "THE PACIFIER \nWritten by \nThomas Lennon & Robert Ben Garant \nPrevious Revisions by \nJason Fulardi, Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewki \nMarch 3rd, 2004 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - DAY \nA fishing boat pushes over choppy water. FOUR GUN TOTING MEN on Jet Skis wearing black wet suits and goggles escort the boat. Flying above it is a HELICOPTER. \nINT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS \nA SERBIAN MAN captains the wheel. SERB 2 scans the horizon with binoculars. He checks the GPS system, then his watch, then speaks into his throat mic. All italics are Serbian w/ subtitles: \nSERB 2 Fifteen minutes to delivery. \nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS \nThe JET SKIER in the lead weighs in on a radio. \nINT. SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS \nThe HELICOPTER PILOT weighs in. \nPILOT All clear from above. \nEXT. SKY - CONTINUOUS \nThe camera descends as the boat passes, and dives beneath the surface. \nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS \nThe droning of engines becomes less pronounced. Foam from the boat and skis bubbles. \nCalm. Then from out of nowhere five NAVY SEALs wearing RE- BREATHERS appear, in neat formation like the Blue Angels. JET PROPELLED BACKPACKS push the SEALs through the water. \nThe LEAD SEAL: SHANE WOLFE, points upwards. All eyes follow his finger to the underbelly of the boat above. From his belt, Shane takes a steel wand with an adhesive disc attached, aims it at the fleeing boat and FIRES. A cable shoots up -- THUD... The disc sticks to the boat's hull. Shane pushes a button on the wand retracting the cable and drawing himself closer. \nDangling from the cruiser, Shane fixes a BOMB to the hull. He releases himself from the boat and speeds away -- \nBOOM. A dense explosion sends ripples through the water and ELECTRICITY crackling around the boat. \nINT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS \nA SURGE of ELECTRICAL FORCE blasts from the control panel. SPARKS fly. \nThe two Serbian Men jolt backwards -- WHAM -- and hit the wall. All the needles inside all the dials go LIMP. The roar of the engines DIES and the boat STOPS. \nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN, UNDER THE BOAT - CONTINUOUS \nShane slips inside the hull, through the new hole. \nINT. SEA HAWK 1 - CONTINUOUS \nThe chopper slows to a hover.   The Pilot looks below. \nPILOT What's happening? \nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - CONTINUOUS \nThe jet skiers protectively circle the injured boat in a SYNCHRONIZED SWIMMING move, and the Jet Ski drivers are simultaneously YANKED below the surface: a split second later they're replaced by our SEALS (ALSO IN BLACK WET SUITS AND GOGGLES) -- the switch happens in less than a second, way too fast for anyone to notice. \nINT. FISHING BOAT/CONTROL DECK - CONTINUOUS \nThe shaken Serbs climb to their feet. \nSERBIAN 2 What happened? \nThey look around, and see the SEALS, on the jet skis: In the masks they are indistinguishable from the GUN-TOTTING MEN they switched paces with. All seems clear. Serb 1 pushes on the throttle... nothing. \nSERBIAN 1 We've been hit. We're taking on water. \nSuddenly the boat lists -- and water pours in, under the cabin door. They spring into action! \nSERBIAN 1 (CONT'D) Grab the professor, quick! \n", "test1_true": "Serb 1 rushes out, shouting orders: He alerts four ARMED GUARDS and the Jet Ski drivers (now our Seals). \nSERBIAN 1 Something must be below us! Shoot! Shoot! \nThe Armed Guards fire relentlessly into the water. Serb 2 rushes below deck. \nINT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS \nPROFESSOR CHARLES PLUMMER, bound to a chair and gagged, tries to YELP as the room begins to flood with water. \nINT. SHIP'S CORRIDOR - SIMULTANEOUS \nSerb 2 runs down steps to the lowermost hold. He tries to force the door open. When it finally opens, he is forced back by a three foot wall of water. \nINT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS \nProfessor Plummer panics, as the water rises up to his mouth He struggles, but can't get free. Up to his nose, over his head.... He's gone. \nThen Shane Wolf rises out of the water, hauling the Professor up. He cuts the Professor's GAG. Plummer screams. Shane removes his mouth piece. Shane doesn't seem the slightest bit fazed by the circumstances. \nSHANE Lieutenant Shane Wolfe, United States Navy. I'm gonna get you outta here. But you have to do exactly what I say, when I say it. My way -- no highway option. Do you copy? (Plummer nods, terrified.) Where's the briefcase? \nThe Professor gestures across the room, where a metal BRIEFCASE is floating. Shane calmly HANDCUFFS it to his own waist. As the water rises, to the roof. \nPLUMMER How did you know where I... \nShane sticks the mouth piece into Plummer's mouth, giving him his oxygen. \nEXT. ON THE DECK - SIMULTANEOUS \nThe Armed Guards stop shooting into the water. One of our SEALS calls out to them, in PERFECT SERBIAN: \nSEAL KEEP SHOOTING! \nThe Guards fire again. The SEAL speaks into his neck mic. \nSEAL (CONT'D) Give it a second, they're almost out of ammo. \nThe Seal calls out: \"shoot more, more!\" They do, until there's nothing but empty CLICKS from their guns. \nSEAL (CONT'D) Now Lieutenant. Chopper's four meters at your 10 o'clock. \nINT. SHIP'S HOLD - CONTINUOUS \nJust before the water envelopes him and Plummer... \nSHANE (into his mic) I've got the Prof and the case. First round's on me back at Virginia Beach. \nShane takes a deep breath, and pulls himself, the Professor and the briefcase UNDER the water. \nEXT. OCEAN'S SURFACE - MOMENTS LATER \nShane and the Professor rise to the surface as the boat falters behind them. Shane pulls out a retractable CROSSBOW. It clicks open and he shoots a CABLE into the belly of the helicopter above him. \nSHANE Hold on. \nINT. HELICOPTER - A SECOND LATER \nShane appears at the Pilot's door, holding the Professor. Shane addresses the Pilot in perfect SERBIAN. \nSHANE You know how to swim? \nThe Pilot nods, terrified. Shane TOSSES the Pilot out. \nShane swings into the hot seat and grabs the controls, pulling the Professor in behind him. \nON THE SURFACE OF THE WATER - CONTINUOUS \nThe SEALS on the Jet Skis SALUTE Shane in the chopper, then disappear gracefully back into the water. \nINT. HELICOPTER - CONTINUOUS \nShane smiles, clearly he loves this kind of day. He looks beside him, the Professor looks terrified. The Professor takes out his mouth piece. \nPLUMMER Oh my God. I can't believe you... how'd we... That was the most incredible... \nShane sticks the mouth piece back in the Professors' mouth, shutting him up. \nSHANE Better keep that on `til we get to the rendezvous point. \nPLUMMER (through the mouth piece) Why? Poison gas? \nSHANE (re: the oxygen) No. I'm just not big on chit chat. \n", "test1_id": 2316, "test2_input": "MURNEY Pretty slick, Frogman -- I'm a black belt myself. S'why they asked me to coach the wrestling team. \nMurney makes a loud Kung Fu CRY and throws a punch, stopping an inch from Shane's head. Shane doesn't flinch. \nMURNEY (CONT'D) See -- total control. Maybe you could stop by practice, we'd show the boys how a couple of pros do it, what do you say? Come on, promise I'll go easy on you. \nSHANE ... Sorry, sir. I'm on duty. \nMURNEY Oh, yeah. That's right. I forgot you had to baby-sit. Maybe some other time then. \nShane puts an arm over Todd's shoulder. Todd shakes him off and heads to class. Murney snickers to Claire: \nMURNEY (CONT'D) Looks like pretty boy there's all bark and no bite. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE ... Don't even think it, Murney. He'd kill you so fast, I wouldn't even have time to get my camera. \nINT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - 2:55 \nShane looks exhausted. Peter is asleep in his shoulder, Tyler is crying, as he keeps watch. The Principal strolls up. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Another day, another dollar twenty, minus taxes... aren't you gonna change him? \nSHANE I'd love to, for one who'll eat, and not cry. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE That's not what I mean, Lt. \nThen Shane smells what she means -- Tyler's diaper is full. Shane recoils in disgust, holding Tyler out like a grenade. \nSHANE Oh -- change him. Roger that. Uh... \nPanicked, he pushes Tyler towards the Principal. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Sirnosir. Not my job. \nSHANE But... \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE Instructions are right on the box. Bathroom's down the hall. Have fun. \nJust then, an alarm in his Jacket GOES OFF. He looks at his tracker: it's flashing RED 3 RED 3. Shane hands off Peter and Tyler to the Principal. \nSHANE Emergency! \nINT. 2ND GRADE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nShane runs down the hall, following his tracking device. It leads him to a door. He bursts though it, doing a shoulder roll. \nINT. 2ND GRADE CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS \n2ND GRADERS are sitting on the floor. Lulu is in front of the class, with the Panic Button in her hand. The board reads: SHOW AND TELL. Shane lands in fight stance -- the Class applauds. Next to Lulu is a very upstaged LITTLE BOY with a FROG. Lulu sticks her tongue out at him. \nLULU See! My nanny can kick your nanny's butt. \nShane is furious, but the FINAL BELL rings. At that moment, his Tracker Alarm sounds again. He looks: \nCLOSE-UP ON THE TRACKER SCREEN: Two DOTS labeled RED 1 and RED 2, are heading away from the school fast. I INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nShane runs with Lulu through the mob of Kids. He hands her to the Principal. \nSHANE Thanks. \nEXT. EAST BETHESDA K-12 SCHOOL - CONTINUOUS \nShane dives into the Minivan. The DOTS on the tracker are headed North. He speeds away after them. \nEXT. BUSY INTERSECTION - MOMENTS LATER \nThe BLINKING DOTS on his tracker are side by side, racing down the road ahead of Shane. They make a sharp right. Shane makes a right, almost tipping the minivan. He blasts through a red light. \nEXT. IN FRONT OF A CONSTRUCTION SITE - MOMENTS LATER \nHe turns a corner -- a PLYWOOD WALL surrounds the site. He leaps out of the minivan. He looks at the tracker: Zoe and Todd are dead ahead, through the fence. \nEXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE - CONTINUOUS \nTwo BIG CONSTRUCTION workers are standing on the other side of the plywood wall -- Shane KICKS out one entire section, and charges through. \nCONSTRUCTION WORKER What hell do you think you're doing? \nHe turns around, to see several CONSTRUCTION WORKERS, all brandishing tools. \nSHANE Tell me where the kids are and I'll let you all live! \nCONSTRUCTION WORKER Buddy, you're about to get a beat down. \n", "test2_true": "ANGLE - SHANE \nHe's alone. He catches his breath, then checks his tracker. Todd and Zoe's BEEPS are coming from a MANHOLE. \nShane pries off the manhole cover.    He looks down. \nIN THE MANHOLE - It's dark and dank. \nNo sweat. Shane lowers himself down. \nINT. SEWER - SAME TIME \nShane lands shoulder deep in DISGUSTING SLUDGE. He winces, then checks the tracker -- the DOTS are CLOSE, feet away. Shane trudges through the river of muck. \nSHANE Red 1?   Red 2? \nIt's horrific. The DOTS BEEP LOUDER. He's almost there! He splashes around a corner -- then gasps -- he sees the blinking lights below the surface. He takes a deep breath and dives under. He comes up for air with ZOE and TODD'S HOMING BEACONS. A note is tied to them: \"Ha! Ha!\" \nINT. PLUMMER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - LATER \nPrincipal Claire sits with the Kids in the living room. From outside, they hear the front door open, and the sound of OMINOUS, SQUISHY footsteps. \nThen the door swings open, revealing Shane, looking like a Swamp Creature. Everyone gasps, then covers their noses. A CUTE YOUNG COP enters behind Shane. Todd stiffens. Zoe fixes her hair. The Cop looks at them. \nCUTE COP 14 year old Male, weird hair. 16 year old female. Ditto. (into his radio:) Cancel that a.p.b.. \nThe Cop turns to Shane, with a smirk. \nCUTE COP (CONT'D) In the future, use our nonemergency number. That's the one to call if nobody's fleein' or bleedin'. \nThe Cop leaves, Zoe checks him out as he goes... \nCLAIRE Shane are you okay? \nSHANE (eerily calm:) Just fine, thank you. \nCovering her nose. The smell is BAD. \nCLAIRE I should probably get going then. If you need anymore help... Call. \nShe practically GAGS as she passes him. Shane looks around at Scott and Zoe, he doesn't say anything, but with his hand he makes a \"my eyes on you\" gesture. \nINT. BATHROOM - LATER \nShane is in the shower. He pours an entire bottle of SHAMPOO over himself. \nINT. BACK YARD - DAY \nShane BURNS his clothes in the barbecue. \nINT. KITCHEN - LATER \nTyler is in a high-chair, Peter rocks in a cradle-swing. \nShane enters, in just a towel. He sees on the fridge; Helga'S SHOPPING LIST -- all junk food. He looks at it, cringing in disgust, before he notices: \nSitting around the table are Lulu's entire BROWNIE TROOP - - a dozen little girls in uniforms, they're staring at him. The Brownies applaud, and whistle. \nBROWNIE oo hoo! Hubba hubba! \nShane covers up and leaps into the Family Room, pulling Lulu after him. \nINT. FAMILY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSHANE Who are those people? \nLULU It's my troop, it's Monday. Monday, Wednesday and Saturday are troop nights. \nSHANE (O.S.) Get rid of them. \nLULU I can't. Everybody's parents go out on troop nights. They won't be home `til ten. Mom's our den mother. \nLulu starts to sniffle, close to tears. \nLULU (CONT'D) Tonight we're supposed to sell cookies. \nSHANE Selling cookies isn't imperative to my mission. \nLULU We have to. If we don't sell enough cookies, we can't go the Jamboree, and if we can't go to the Jamboree. (whispers:) Come on, Shane. You gotta help me out. They already think I'm a loser. And it's not like I have any other friends, cause mom never lets me out of her sight... \nLulu's about to burst into tears. Shane sighs. \nINT. KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER \n", "test2_id": 2317, "test3_input": "The kids instantly freeze. Claire strides into view. She's wearing a cute dress, and a little make-up. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE (CONT'D) (a long, severe stare) Now... WALK! DOUBLE TIME. \nChastened, the kids gulp and orderly march away. Shane's eyes alight, impressed. \nSHANE Wow.   I'm glad I never had you for a CO. \nS \nT \nP \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE (she coyly smiles) I've noticed improvement in your troops lately, too. Noon and none of them have been called to my office. It's a miracle. S he sits beside him, and offers him a milk. \nRINCIPAL CLAIRE (CONT'D) Buy you a drink, sailor? \nSHANE Thanks. \nhey eat in silence. Shane`s not so good at small talk. She's waiting for him to say... something. \nSHANE (CONT'D) You look nice today. \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE This old thing? Well, you never know who you're going to run into. \nShe smiles. He smiles back... Suddenly, there's a commotion: Murney is marching Todd towards them, dragging him by the ear. Principal Claire sighs \"not again.\" In one move, Shane leaps over the table. Principal Claire watches him leap: \nPRINCIPAL CLAIRE (CONT'D) ... Love it when he does that. \nMurney shoves Todd forward. \nMURNEY I've had it. I just caught this boy dancing under the bleachers like some kind of Bavarian fruitcake. \nMurney gets up in Shane's face. \nMURNEY (CONT'D) I want this freak outta my school and into treatment. Somebody needs to give this punk a talking to... \nTODD Hey. I'm right here. Talk. E veryone is shocked that Todd talked back. A hushed whisper goes through the cafeteria. Murney turns around. \nM \nMURNEY You got something to say? Boy? \nTODD Yeah. Yeah I do. I quit, Murney. \nA hushed \"oooh\" goes through the Students. \nMURNEY Winners never quit, boy. What're you so scared of, Freak? \nThe Students snicker. Todd looks, intimidated. Then: \nTODD I am not scared. I... I want to sing. \nSilence. No one's sure they heard him right. Todd pulls out a stack of SOUND OF MUSIC FLYERS and hands them out. Todd is on the poster in his Rolf costume. Principal Claire takes one: she laughs, now it all makes sense. \nTODD (CONT'D) I'm in Sound of Music. It opens Friday... \nMURNEY A musical? You're blowing off wrestling for a musical? (to Shane:) This is what happens when there's no man in the house. \nTODD There is a man in my house -- me. (Murney turns:) Let's get one thing clear. I'm not quitting cause I hate wresting. I'm quitting because you're a bad coach. You suck. The whole team wants to quit. I'm the only one with the guts to do it. M urney looks over at the Team. They look to the ground sheepishly, Todd's telling the truth. Murney looks around, humiliated, furious -- \nURNEY So -- you're a tough guy now? \nMurney takes ONE STEP towards Todd -- Shane steps between them, protecting him. \nMURNEY (CONT'D) Stay out of this, baby sitter! \nMurney glares at him -- face to face. So calm, it's scary \nS \nSHANE You said you wanted to wrestle. You win. Let's do it. \nEveryone is watching. Murney did not expect to be called out. His voice cracks -- then he regains his calm: \nMURNEY After school. The Gym. Your ass is mine. \nHe storms out. There is a stunned moment -- and then a mob of Students, and a lot of CUTE GIRLS, swarm Todd, taking flyers. Shane gives Todd a proud thumbs up. \nA QUICK SERIES OF SHOTS: Of STUDENTS whispering to other STUDENTS, passing notes: A Kid opens a note -- it reads: \"Murney's getting his ass kicked. 3:00.\" \nINT. GYM - 3:00 \n", "test3_true": "SHANE I'll be sure to lock up when I'm through. \nMurney roars and CHARGES Shane. Shane defensively uses Murney's momentum to flip him halfway across the mat. WHAM. Murney lands on his back. \nThe Wrestlers mouths drop. Murney, shocked, climbs to his feet and CHARGES again, Shane side-steps, and sweeps Murney -- sending him right into the wall, hard. \nMurney bounds to his feet, rushes Shane. Shane DIVES OVER Murney, grabs onto Murney's waist. Shane's momentum pulls Murney backwards -- BAM. Murney's shoulders hit the mat with Shane smiling down on him. \nTodd flops to the mat, raises his hand and SLAPS it down- \nTODD Pinned! \nShane stands. Shane throws an arm around Todd, and they head out. The Wrestling Team huddles around Murney, who's quietly twitching on the ground, mumbling something. \nS \nTODD (CONT'D) Is he okay? \nSHANE Dislocated nerve, that's all. He'll be fine in (checking his watch) two months. \nTODD That was awesome. \nThey walk out. The crowd cheers. Claire, too. Shane S smiles at her as he passes. She gives him a thumbs up. \nSHANE (to Todd) Let's go, Todd. I got my troops waiting. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nShane marches the Brownies through a FOREST.    He wears Peter and Tyler in front and rear Snuggles. \nSHANE If you're ever lost in the woods, the first thing you have to do is find a source of drinking water! And make sure it's potable. If you're not sure, boil it for thirty minutes! \nThe girls are loving it, fascinated. \nSHANE (CONT'D) You have to eat, right? Well let me tell you you're not gonna find Girl Scout cookies out here. \nLULU We're Brownies. \nSHANE No brownies   either. A lot of roots are edible. So    is some tree bark. When I HALO'd into   Rwanda, I lived off the underground   fern stem for three weeks! \nShane kicks over a ROCK.    Underneath are crawling BUGS. \nSHANE (CONT'D) Insects. They look nasty but they're full of nutrients that may save your life. \nHe scoops up some bugs and EATS them. \nBROWNIE He's eating Roly-Polies! \nThe Brownies are frozen in shock. \nSHANE (mouth full of bugs:) Wots of pwotien! \nE UPBEAT MUSIC kicks in over the following MONTAGE: \nEXT. PLUMMER HOUSE - FRONT LAWN - DAWN \nShane leads the Brownie Troop through Combat exercises. In unison, the Girls PUNCH, KICK. PUNCH, PUNCH, KICK. Shane's got Tyler's cradle next to him, in between punches, in perfect tempo, he reaches out and rocks it. The Duck watches all this -- fascinated. \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT - EARLY MORNING \nThe lot is empty. Shane and Zoe sit in the minivan, Shane holds a stopwatch. He signals her, she burns rubber, and races through a slalom of orange cones -- she hits EVERY ONE -- the wheel hubs are CLOGGED with cones. She skids to a stop just short of the \"Severe Tire Damage\" spikes. \nINT. NURSERY - DAY \nShane changes Tyler's diaper WITH ONE HAND. In his other hand he's reading The Brownie Handbook. It's open to a page that reads \"Knot Tying.\" \nINT. OLD FACTORY - DAY \nThe CAST is assembled on stage, where Shane has set up a scale model of the set on the floor. He illustrates the stage directions, by moving around toy army men: S SHANE Okay -- we'll put Von Trapps here, here, and... here at the top of the stairs. Now the Nazis are gonna come in, this way -- and the Von Trapp is set... \nHe laughs at his own joke... The Kids don't get it. \nEXT. MALL PARKING LOT - DAY \nZoe leaps into the minivan through the windows. Zoe peels out and weaves the cones... \nT \nI \nE \n", "test3_id": 2318}

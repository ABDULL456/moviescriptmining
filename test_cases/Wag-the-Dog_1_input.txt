BREAN Well, c'n we get him back home? 
PILOT Could if we had to.  Rather not.  Rough weather. 
BREAN AND MOSS GET UP, MOVE TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE PLANE, MOSS LOOKING OUT OF THE WINDOW. 
MOSS Well, they're protecting him well enough. 
BREAN They should be.  Most valuable animal since Sea Biscuit.  Isn't he... 
MOSS Bigger than that.  For want of a nail a Kingdom was lost... 
BREAN You've got something, there... 
AMES (WRITING) Napoleon said -- A man will not sell you his life... 
THEY LOOK OUT THE WINDOW, START STRAIGHTENING UP THEIR CLOTHING, ET CETERA, IN PREPARATION FOR MEETING SCHUMANN. BREAN LOOKS HACK OVER HIS SHOULDER AT THE TELEVISION. 
ANGLE HIS POV. ON THE TV A PICTURE HEADED "ANDREWS AIRFORCE BASE," AND SIGNS OF SCAFFOLDING BEING CONSTRUCTED, AND BUNTING PUT UP.  CUTS TO A TALKING HEAD, IN FRONT OF A PHOTO OF SCHUMANN. 
ANGLE MOSS AND BREAN. 
BREAN ...a masterpiece... 
MOSS (SHRUGS) ...givem what they want...But... 
THEY MOVE TOWARD THE FRONT OF THE PLANE. THEY RUN INTO THE PILOT. 
PILOT Weather's worsening, sir...might be advisable, wait it out, on the ground, till.. 
BREAN (NODS) We're due at Andrews. (LOOKS AT HIS WATCH) 
PILOT Well, I wouldn't go up in it, lest I had to... 
MOSS (TO AMES) Here he comes... 
THEY HEAR THE PLANE DOOR OPENING. THEY ALL STRAIGHTEN UP AND SMILE, AS SCHUMANN, A RAINCOAT OVER HIS SHOULDERS, IS LED ONTO THE PLANE, FLANKED BY 4 M.P.'S, AND AN OFFICER, WITH A CLIPBOARD. 
MOSS Sergeant Schumann?  If I may?  Welcome to History... 
AMES Sergeant Schumann?  My name is Ames.  Welcome. 
OFFICER S'mby named Brean?  Sign here... 
BREAN (TO THE PILOT) Captain...  You wanna Take'er up...? 
PILOT Heavy weather East of here. 
BREAN Whaddaya think? 
PILOT Six to five and pick'em...you wanna chance it... 
THEY ARE QUIET, AS SOUNDS OF THE TV FILTER IN.  AN EXCITED NEWSCASTER. 
NEWSCASTER (ON TV) Word that William Schumann, the Old Shoe, is expected back, today, and that a glimpse of him... 
MOSS Let's fly, if it'll fly... People waiting for us... 
THE PHONE RINGS.  BREAN ANSWERS IT. 
BREAN (ON PHONE.  HE HAS NOT YET REGISTERED SCHUMANN) ...child at the airport... (TO MOSS) breaks through the ranks, runs to "old shoe" -- should we have flower or a bear...? 
AMES Uh...Didn't we do this? 
BREAN Never quit a winner. 
MOSS I thought they weren't meeting him at the airport... 
BREAN They insist they wanna go with meeting him at the airport.  I told'em they're wrong, I can't convince'em. They're concerned that the last kid had the Wheat. Variations include, the kid is a boy, the kid is twins, it's a little dog ... they rub meat on Schumann's cuff, the dog runs to him... 
MOSS (OF SCHUMANN) Uh... 
IN THE B.G. BREAN FINISHES SIGNING THE CLIPBOARD, THE OFFICER NODS TO THE M.P.'S, AND THEY SALUTE AND DEPART, THE OFFICER HANDS A KEY TO BREAN. 
AMES (OF KEY) What's this...? 
THE OFFICER TAKES THE RAINCOAT FROM SCHUMANN'S SHOULDERS, REVEALING HE IS IN A PRISON UNIFORM, AND HEAVILY MANACLED.  THE MAN, IS SCHUMANN, AN UNMISTAKABLE DERANGED, DROOLING, PSYCHO-NUTTER.  HOLD. 
OFFICER (TAKES A KEY ON A CHAIN FROM AROUND HIS NECK -- HANDS IT TO BREAN) Key to the manacles... 
THE OFFICER SALUTES, STARTS OUT OF THE PLANE. 
ANGLE.  AMES LOOKS BACK, AT THE MANACLED SCHUMANN, AND BREAN GLARING, OPEN MOUTHED AT HIM. 
ANGLE EXT THE PLANE, THE OFFICER RETREATING, IN THE RAIN, TO THE TRUCK, AMES, RUNNING AFTER HIM.

LOUANNE (crying) I don't know... I thought he... loved me... 
WINTERS Loved you? He loves anything that winks back, the little rat bastard. And what are you gonna do for school now? I use my influence to get you back in, it'll stink to high hell. The press'll crucify me. 
LOUANNE I'll get in someplace. 
WINTERS God, Louanne, I told you to stay away from my players. That was my cardinal rule, stay away from the damn players... 
LOUANNE They've always been good enough for you. Good enough to devote your life to. Why aren't they good enough for me? Or are they too good? 
WINTERS You're changing the subject, Louanne. We're talkin' about you breakin' the rules. 
LOUANNE Didn't you ever break the rules just a little? Didn't you tell me once that 90 per cent of the schools obey the NCAA rules, and the other 10 per cent go to bowl games? Was that just a joke? 
She gets up and walks out of the room. Winters closes his eyes and slumps down on the couch. 
INT. STUDY HALL - NIGHT 
Darnell sits at his table waiting for Autumn. Autumn storms in, obviously upset about something. She slaps a corrected test down in front of him. 
AUTUMN You seen this? You got a D on your math test. 
DARNELL Yeh, I kinda figured that. I had some trouble on this last part... 
AUTUMN We went over that last week, Darnell. What is this time we spend in here? Just a joke to you? I don't even think you've been listening to me. 
DARNELL I've been listening to you, baby... 
AUTUMN Don't call me baby. I thought you wanted to learn. But if all you wanta do is fake your way through, then get another tutor to waste time with. 
DARNELL C'mon, Autumn, we just had a good time, and now you're gettin' all nuts behind this. It's just one test. 
AUTUMN So far, it's the only test. I want you to study this whole chapter. By yourself, without me here. When I come back, we'll discuss it. Be ready to do problems based on it. 
DARNELL Whatever you say, Teach. (big grin) I don't wish to be cast in a pejorative light, so I'm dedicating myself to achieving on a level more commensurate with my abilities. 
She shakes her head and walks away. Darnell's grin fades. He looks at his test, a hint of tears in his eyes. He's embarrassed and deeply worried. 
INT. FOOTBALL LOCKER ROOM - DAY 
The players are dressing for Monday practice, but it's strangely subdued. Bobby Collins opens his locker to find a BULLET-RIDDLED PRACTICE JERSEY hanging inside. Immediately the rest of the players burst into raucous laughter. 
BUD LITE Coach'd probably shoot ya lower. 
Suddenly the room goes silent. Standing in the doorway is Coach Winters. 
He says nothing, looks around the room, the players avoiding his gaze. His eyes come to rest on Bobby. Bobby tries to hide the shirt, but Winters has seen. Winters just stares at Bobby a beat, then. 
WINTERS You all played a fine game on Saturday. Take the day off. 
With that, he turns and walks out the door. The players remain silent. Bobby throws the shirt in the trash. 
INT. LOUANNE'S SORORITY HOUSE - DAY 
Winters walks in the front door, past the desk, up the stairs and down the hall to his daughter's room. She's packing her things. He goes over to her, takes her in his arms and hugs her tight. Neither speak. A tear rolls down Louanne's cheek. Hits the floor. 
EXT. HALL OF ATHLETIC BUILDING - DAY 
A very nervous Bobby Collins comes down the hall and knocks on Coach Winter's door. 
WINTERS C'mon in, Collins. 
INT. COACH WINTER'S OFFICE 
Bobby enters and stands across from Winters' desk. Winters doesn't invite him to sit. 
BOBBY Listen, Coach, I just want you to know I'm really sorry about this whole thing with Louanne. I was real glad to hear she's gonna be goin' to junior college here... 
WINTERS (cutting him off) Shut up. 
Bobby does. Instantly. 
WINTERS I could easily take your case to the Board of Regents. You've had no prior infractions and I could argue that you were under abnormal pressure. (pause) But I won't. You embarrassed me, you embarrassed my family, you embarrassed the program. As of now, you are no longer a member of this university or it's football team. Clean out your locker. 
Bobby just stands there a beat, in confusion and disbelief. There is no wavering, no sympathy in Winters' eyes. Finally, dazed and disoriented, Bobby turns and walks out.

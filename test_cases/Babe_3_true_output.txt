RICHARD (CONT'D) Where's the nearest hospital? 
ANWAR It's far away, about four hours. (a beat) There's a clinic that's a little closer, about an hour and a half to the south. By bus it'll take us about two hours and a half though. 
RICHARD Does that takes away from Marrakesh? 
ANWAR Yes, but it's the closest thing we've got. 
Richard runs down the aisle and gets out of the bus. 
55   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAY 
No cars drive by. The road is almost deserted. In the distance, a run-down Renault approaches. Richard stands in the road to stop it. 
The car brakes and Richard runs toward the driver: an old peasant traveling with his eight year-old grandson. 
RICHARD I need your help. We were attacked. 
OLD MAN (In Arabic) I don't understand... 
Richard grows desperate. 
RICHARD Help... hospital... 
OLD MAN (In Arabic) I don't understand you sir. 
Richard sees that Anwar and the bus driver have gotten out of the bus and he starts shouting at them for help. 
RICHARD Tell him we need his help. 
With the distraction, the old man drives off. Richard watches helplessly as they drive away and he grabs Anwar by the arm. 
RICHARD (CONT'D) Let's take her to the clinic. 
56   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAY 
The bus makes a U-turn and drives away at full speed. 
57   INT. BUS -- DAY 
The bus rattles along. Richard huddles over Susan, trying to stop the blood flowing from her neck. Barth, an old man starts shouting. 
BARTH Marrakech isn't this way. They're going to shoot at us again. 
RICHARD We've got to get her to a hospital. 
BARTH They're going to kill us all. Turn back... turn the bus around... 
Richard gets exasperated at the old man's screaming. 
RICHARD Shut up, god damn it! 
Barth shuts up and the bus drives on. 
58   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAY 
The bus bounces its way down the straight highway. 
59   INT. BUS -- DAY 
The passengers sit quietly. As the ride gets bumpier, Susan starts to cry out in pain. 
SUSAN It hurts, it hurts... 
Richard tries to calm her down. 
RICHARD Easy, sweetie, easy... 
SUSAN It hurts... it hurts so much... 
Richard turns her around and sees her shoulder has been shattered. She won't stop shouting. A pool of blood starts trickling down the aisle. 
RICHARD (A Anwar) Isn't there anywhere else we can take her? 
ANWAR We can take her to my town. It's near here and there's a doctor. In the meantime we can call Erfourd for an ambulance. 
Richard turns to look at Susan, who is writhing in pain. 
RICHARD Ok. 
ANWAR (To the driver, in Arabic) Make a right onto the next road. 
Richard and Anwar exchange a glance. 
60   EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY -- DAY 
The bus leaves the main road and turns into a dirt road. 
61   INT. BUS -- DAY 
The bus' poor suspension gives the passengers a jolt.    Richard tries to protect Susan's head. 
62   EXT. HAMLET -- DAY 
The bus pulls into a small group of houses. Several children run beside the bus, chasing it. Some gaunt dogs get out of the way to let the bus by. 
63   EXT. ANWAR'S HOUSE -- DAY 
The bus pulls up in front of a modest house. 
64   INT. BUS -- DAY 
Richard raises his head and sees the desolate environs. 
RICHARD Are we here?

Andre grabs Yuri and presses the gun into Yuri's palm, clasping his own hand over Yuri's. 
ANDRE JNR. We'll do it together.  A bonding experience. 
Andre forces Yuri's finger onto the trigger as he aims at the terrified Simeon - eyes pleading. 
Yuri attempts to pull his hand away but Andre is too strong. 
ANDRE JNR. You can stop if you want - but you do.  Just say the word. 
Andre stares at Yuri not Simeon. 
ANDRE JNR. (cont'd) Say, "stop". 
Yuri opens his mouth but no word comes.  Andre presses Yuri's finger onto the trigger. 
The gun goes off.  A splash of blood across the sofa's green upholstery. 
The gunshot echoes around the room.  Simeon is very dead. 
YURI (quietly) Stop. 
Andre smiles. 
ANDRE JNR. (surveying the blood-spattered room) I'll get you another room with a nicer view. 
INT.  HOTEL AFRICA - LIBERIA.  DAY. 
YURI collapses on the bar - gestures to the BARMAN who immediately pours a line of cocaine in full view. 
YURI hoovers it up. 
YURI (V.O.) I started doing a lot of cocaine in West Africa.  I wasn't medicating myself.  I was simply playing catch-up.  I was constantly dealing with people who are chemically imbalanced without the aid of chemicals. It's just a matter of etiquette.  It's rude to act sane in a room full of lunatics. 
The Barman nods to a patron at a corner table - a SEASONED FIGHTER - no more than eighteen years old. 
BARMAN He bought you "brown-brown", Mr. Yuri. 
YURI (wiping his nose) What? 
BARMAN "Brown-brown". 
YURI What is it? 
BARMAN (laughs) A mixture - cocaine and gunpowder. 
YURI What does the gunpowder do? 
BARMAN It's magic.  They give it to the small boys before battle - they do anything. 
YURI Some other time. 
BARMAN You have to try it at least once, Mr. Yuri. 
The Barman starts chopping another line. 
YURI Why? 
BARMAN (laughing) Because it's your gunpowder. 
Sure enough the Barman pours the gunpowder from one of Yuri's 39mm shells into the cocaine. 
The SEASONED FIGHTER, assault rifle slung over his shoulder, intimidating air, sidles up to Yuri - stares him down.  Yuri has no option, does a line. 
He washes it down with a swig from a vodka bottle, raises his glass to the fighter. 
The Barman puts on a Ukrainian folk song.  Yuri picks out one of the PROSTITUTES in the bar, starts dancing. 
He drunkenly dances with one PROSTITUTE after another - the dance almost violent, the prostitutes flung aside, none lasting more than a few seconds - caught in the arms of the other PATRONS. 
To Yuri, the bar swims before his eyes. 
The music stops.  Yuri, wild-eyed, looks at the stunned bar room. 
YURI (to no one in particular, whipping his vodka bottle off the bar) I'm going for a walk. 
EXT.  MONROVIA.  NIGHT. 
A MONTAGE OF SCENES FROM YURI'S P.O.V. IN HIS ALTERED STATE.  [A MIXTURE OF FORMATS INCLUDING SUPER-8 & VIDEO, SHAKY HANDHELD FOOTAGE, OVER-EXPOSED FOOTAGE, BLACK & WHITE FOOTAGE EDITED OUT-OF- SEQUENCE WITH JUMP CUTS AND FLASH FRAMES] 
YURI staggers towards the edge of town - still swigging from his bottle. 
A ROOM WITH A CURVED CEILING ON THE OUTSKIRTS OF MONROVIA 
YURI, eyes unable to focus, stares at a WOMAN'S FACE in front of him, moving back and forth.  The gyrating stops. 
Yuri realizes he is lying in the mouth of an enormous cement pipe on his back, a prostitute on top of him.  She gets to her feet, adjusting her dress. 
Yuri panics, hurriedly zipping himself. 
YURI (a mixture of French and English) I didn't fuck you, did I?  Did I fuck you?

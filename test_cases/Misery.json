{"test1_input": "ANNIE (Gently, her fingers go to his eyelids, close them) Now you mustn't tire yourself. You've got to rest, you almost died. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE: CLOSE UP. Sometimes her face shows the most remarkable compassion. It does now. \nHOLD ON IT briefly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE UP ON PILLS IN ANNIE'S HAND \nANNIE (O.S.) Open wide. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM \nHe lies in bed. His fever is gone, but he's terribly weak. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE. As she lays the pills on PAUL'S TONGUE, she gives him a glass of water from the nearby bed table. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, swallowing eagerly. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, watching him, sympathetically. \nANNIE Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they? (Paul says nothing, but his pain is clear) It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you. \nPAUL Will I be able to walk? \nANNIE Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there. (proudly) But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better. \nAnd now suddenly she flicks off the blankets, uncovering his body. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, staring, stunned at the bottom half of his body as we \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S LEGS. From the knees down he resembles an Egyptian mummy--she's splinted them with slim steel rods that look like the hacksawed remains of aluminum crutches and there's taping circling around. \nFrom the kness up they're all swollen and throbbing and horribly bruised and discolored. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, lying back, stunned with disbelief. \nANNIE It's not nearly as bad as it looks. You have a compound fracture of the tibia in both legs, and the fibula in the left leg is fractured too. I could hear the bones moving, so it's best for your legs to remain immobile. And as soon as the roads open, I'll take you to a hospital. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE: CLOSE UP \nANNIE In the meantime, you've got a lot of recovering to do, and I consider it an honor that you'll do it in my home. \nHOLD on her ecstatic face. \nThen-- \nCUT TO: \nMISERY'S PERFECT FACE. We're back in SINDELL's office in New York. The office looks just the same, posters and manuscripts all over. But she doesn't. \nShe holds the phone and she is fidgety, insecure. \nSINDELL This is Marcia Sindell calling from New York City. I'd like to speak to the Silver Creek Chief of Police or the Sheriff. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Which one do you want? \nSINDELL Whichever one's not busy. \nCUT TO: \nSMALL OFFICE IN SILVER CREEK \n...with a view of the mountains. \nA MARVELOUS LOOKING MAN sits at a desk, by himself, holding the phone. In his sixties, he's still as bright, fast and sassy as he was half-a-lifetime ago. Never mind what his name is, everyone calls him BUSTER. \nBUSTER I'm pretty sure they 're both not busy, Ms. Sindell, since they're both me. I also happen to be President of the Policeman's Benefit Association, Chairman of the Patrolman's Retirement Fund, and if you need a good fishing guide, you could do a lot worse; call me Buster, everybody does, what can I do for you? \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_true": "SINDELL I'm a literary agent, and I feel like a fool calling you, but I think one of my clients, Paul Sheldon, might be in some kind of trouble. \nBUSTER Paul Sheldon? You mean Paul Sheldon the writer? \nSINDELL Yes. \nBUSTER He's your client, huh? \nSINDELL Yes, he is. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER'S OFFICE \nHe rolls a penny across the back of one hand--he's very good at it, doesn't even look while he does it. \nBUSTER People sure like those Misery books. \nSINDELL I'm sure you know Paul's been going to the Silver Creek Lodge for years to finish his books. \nBUSTER Yeah, I understand he's been up here the last six weeks. \nSINDELL Not quite. I just called, and they said he checked out five days ago. Isn't that a little strange? \nBUSTER I don't know. Does he always phone you when he checks out of hotels? \nCUT TO: \nSINDELL, really embarrassed now. \nSINDELL No, no, of course not. It's just that his daughter hasn't heard from him, and when he's got a book coming out, he usually keeps in touch. So when there was no word from him... \nBUSTER You think he might be missing? \nSINDELL (shakes her head) I hate that I made this call--tell me I'm being silly. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER. He nods as a WOMAN enters, carrying lunch. It's his wife, VIRGINIA. She begins putting the food down on a table for the both of them. \nBUSTER Just a little over-protective, maybe. (beat) Tell you what--nothing's been reported out here-- (he puts Paul Sheldon's name with a ? on a 3 x 5 CARD) --but I'll put his name through our system. (he tacks the card to a bulletin board) And if anything turns up, I'll call you right away. \nCUT TO: \nSINDELL. She smiles, a genuine sense of relief. \nSINDELL I appreciate that. Thanks a lot. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER \nBUSTER G'bye, Ms. Sindell. \nAs he hangs up-- \nVIRGINIA We actually got a phone call. Busy morning. \nBUSTER (smiles) Work, work, work. (gives her a hug) Virginia? When was that blizzard? \nVIRGINIA Four or five days ago. Why? \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER. The penny flies across the back of his hand. He doesn't look at it, stares instead out the window at the mountains. \nBUSTER (a beat) ...no reason... \nHOLD ON BUSTER for a moment. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM \nPAUL'S VOICE (soft) I guess it was kind of a miracle... you finding me... \nANNIE's soft, sweet laughter is heard. She stands over him, finishing shaving him with a very sharp straight razor. She wears what we will come to know as her regular costume--plain wool skirts, grey cardigan sweaters. \nANNIE No, it wasn't a miracle at all... in a way, I was following you. \nPAUL Following me? \nANNIE concentrates on shaving him with great care; she has wonderful, strong hands. \nANNIE (explaining, normally) Well, it wasn't any secret to me that you were staying at the Silver Creek, seeing as how I'm your number- one fan and all. Some nights I'd just tool on down there, sit outside and look up at the light in your cabin-- (gently moves his head back, exposing his neck; this next is said with total sincerity, almost awe) and I'd try to imagine what was going on in the room of the world's greatest writer. \nPAUL Say that last part again, I didn't quite hear-- \n", "test1_id": 3204, "test2_input": "CUT TO: \nPAUL, glancing around-- \n--and there it is, on a coffee table in the living room. Also on the table are a roll of Scotch tape, a pair of scissors, and a copy of Newsweek. Paul wheels toward the table and the book, which is as big as a folio Shakespeare play and as thick as a family Bible. \nCUT TO: \nTHE LIVING ROOM \nPAUL, opening the book. \nCUT TO: \nTHE FIRST PAGE OF THE BOOK, as Paul opens it. It's a newspaper clipping as is almost all of what follows. A small article: simply a birth announcement for Anne Marie Wilkes. \nPAUL turns the page. This headline reads: \"Investment Banker Carl Wilkes Dies in Freak Fall.\" \n\"USC Nursing Student Dies in Freak Fall.\" That's the headline on the next page. \nNow: \"Miss Wilkes is Nursing School Honors Graduate.\" \nPaul turns the page. \nManchester, New Hampshire, Union Leader: \"Ernest Gonyar, 79, Dies After Long Illness.\" \nNow that phrase seems to be what catches our eye--\"after long illness\" is from the next article. \"Long illness\" from the one after that. Then, on the next page, a variation: \"Short Illness.\" \nNow we're in Pennsylvania: \"New Hospital Staff Announced.\" \nAnd here come those phrases again on page after page--\"After Long Illness.\" \"After Long Illness.\" \n\"After Long Illness.\" \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, transfixed; he keeps on turning the pages--the states keep changing, moving west. Pennsylvania to Minnesota, Minnesota to North Dakota. And always the clippings reporting deaths and deaths and-- \n--and now we're in Colorado. \"NEW HEAD MATERNITY NURSE NAMED.\" And now the dead are young and helpless; babies. More and more of them. \nPAUL (stunned) Holy shit. \nThen a headline which reads: \n\"HEAD MATERNITY NURSE QUESTIONED ON INFANT DEATHS\" \nNext page: \"MISS WILKES RELEASED.\" \nNext page: \"THREE MORE INFANTS DIE.\" \nNext page, at last: \"DRAGON LADY ARRESTED.\" \nThen a photo: the front page of the Rocky Mountain Gazette. Annie on the courthouse steps. \"DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE,\" under which there is a statement by Annie Wilkes. \nPaul turns quickly to the next page and a very large headline: \n\"DRAGON LADY FOUND NOT GUILTY\" \nPAUL just sits there, shaking his head in bewilderment. \nCUT TO: \nTHE BOOK, as Paul turns the LAST page. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, stunned and now we find out why, as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE PAGE IN THE BOOK. It's an article from Newsweek magazine, a picture of Paul's car being hauled up out of the snow. Above it this caption: \"Presumed Dead--Paul Sheldon.\" \nCUT TO: \nPAUL. Slamming the book shut, putting it back on the coffee table, then quickly turning his wheelchair as we \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, steering his wheelchair toward the front door. He tries to position himself for a surprise attack of ANNIE, but he can't find a way to get close enough. The wheelchair is too cumbersome. He looks around and decides to head back to his room. He is faced with the same problem there--so he struggles into bed and, lying on his back, he rests the knife on his chest and stares up at the ceiling. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPAUL'S WINDOW, hours later. The rain has stopped. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL--trying to stay awake. After a few beats, he hears something. It's the sound of a CAR PULLING UP. \nHEADLIGHTS can be seen flashing through the window. PAUL grips the knife and hides it under the covers. The sound of a CAR DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING, then FOOTSTEPS. \n", "test2_true": "After a beat, we hear the TELEVISION. Someone is explaining how you can buy millions of dollars of prime real estate with no money down. \nPAUL, allowing himself to relax, slips the knife under the mattress. As the TV DRONES ON, Paul lies staring up at the ceiling. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. \nWe hear a clap of THUNDER and once again the rain pours down. \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE UP: PAUL--eyes closed. There is another loud THUNDERCLAP which causes Paul to stir and open his eyes. \nHe turns his head and another CLAP OF THUNDER is heard, LIGHTNING flashes and reveals ANNIE standing over his bed. \nBefore he can react, she jabs a needle into his arm, pulls it out and starts out of the room. \nPAUL tries to raise himself, but the power of the drug causes him to collapse, unconscious. \nCUT TO: \nTHE ROOM. EARLY MORNING. \nIt's stopped raining, PAUL lies asleep. Now, surprisingly, we hear a VOICE we've never heard in the movie before--loud-- for an instant we don't recognize the voice, then we do: It's LIBERACE talking to his audience on a record going, \"Thank you, thank you, what a wonderful thing it is for me to be back with you in Paris...\" PAUL stirs and awakens to discover that he is strapped to his bed. He can move his arms, but that's it. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, standing in the room, and she looks very together; her eyes are bright. Too bright. Way too bright. \nShe comes to the foot of his bed. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, groggy from being drugged, tries to clear the cobwebs. \nANNIE (in a soft voice) Paul, I know you've been out. \nPAUL What? \nANNIE You've been out of your room. \nPAUL No, I haven't. \nANNIE Paul, my little ceramic penguin in the study always faces due south. \nPAUL I don't know what you're talking about. \nPAUL looks up at her--he is totally honest and sincere. As he talks, his hand surreptitiously begins moving toward the mattress edge. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, as she brings the fat-hand led knife out of her skirt pocket. \nANNIE Is this what you're looking for? I know you've been out twice, Paul. At first, I couldn't figure out how you did it, but last night I found your key. (She holds up the bobby pin) I know I left  my scrapbook out, and I can imagine what you might be thinking of me. But you see, Paul, it's all okay. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, as she walks slowly back to the foot of the bed. \nAnd now a THUMP comes from the foot of the bed. Something is out of sight. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, staring at her; waiting. \nANNIE Last night it came so clear. I realize you just need more time. Eventually, you'll come to accept the idea of being here. Paul, do you know about the early days at the Kimberly Diamond Mine? Do you know what they did to the native workers who stole diamonds? Don't worry, they didn't kill them. That would be like junking a Mercedes just because it had a broken spring-- no, if they caught them they had to make sure they could go on working, but they also had to make sure they could never run away. The operation was called hobbling. \nAnd with that, she reaches down out of sight and comes up holding a 16-inch piece of 4 x 4 wood. \nPAUL Annie, whatever you're thinking about, don't do it. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE. She wedges the 4 x 4 firmly between his legs, just above the ankles, secures it and adjusts his feet. \nANNIE Now don't fuss, Paul. \nPAUL Why would I run away? I'm a writer, Annie--it's all I am--and I've never written this well--even you said that this is my best, didn't you? \nANNIE picks up a sledgehammer. \nPAUL Didn't you? Why would I leave a place where I'm doing my best work? It doesn't make any sense. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, positioning herself to the side of his right ankle. \n", "test2_id": 3205, "test3_input": "ANNIE Shh, darling, trust me-- (taking aim at his ankle) It's for the best. \nShe takes the sledgehammer back. \nPAUL Annie, for God's sake, please. \nAs ANNIE swings, the sledgehammer makes contact with the ankle. It breaks with a sharp CRACK. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL: CLOSE UP, shrieking. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, moving to the other side of the bed. \nANNIE Almost done, just one more. \nAnd as she breaks the other ankle, PAUL shrieks even louder. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE: CLOSE UP. \nANNIE God, I love you... \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S FACE. He is beyond agony. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nFor a long moment, nothing. \nThen... a FAINT SOUND. After a moment, it begins to become more intrusive and we can tell what it is: a car horn HONKING. \nFADE IN ON: \nSILVER CREEK and ANNIE in her Cherokee, HONKING for another car to get a move on. \nCUT TO: \nA HAND AND A COIN MOVING ACROSS IT, from finger to finger. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nBUSTER, sitting by the front window of his office, reading The Rocky Mountain Gazette. \nHe watches idly as ANNIE yells out the window to the car in front of her. THE DRIVER of the car yells back. Annie yells louder. The Driver guns off, and Annie pulls into the parking space next to the General Store. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, getting out, shaking a fist at the other car, calling out, \"You poop!\" She enters the store. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER, staring straight ahead. Something is gnawing at him. \nCUT TO: \nVIRGINIA, in his office, tidying the desk. BUSTER enters, looks angry. \nBUSTER Just leave it, all right? \nVIRGINIA Oh, I like that tone. \nBUSTER How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here. (rooting through a pile of papers) Where the hell is that thing? \nVIRGINIA What thing? \nBUSTER That thing. (finding what he's looking for, a 3 x 5 card) Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be. \nVIRGINIA What is it? \nBUSTER I'm not sure. Maybe nothing. \nVIRGINIA It's good you found it. \nBUSTER There's that spice again. \nAs BUSTER leaves, VIRGINIA goes back to tidying the desk. \nCUT TO: \nA LARGE LIBRARY as Buster leaves his car, hurries inside and \nCUT TO: \nLIBRARY STACKS \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO: \nBUSTER, frustrated, puts one set of volumes down, picks up another, starts through it, as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE ROCKY MOUNTAIN GAZETTE, as the pages turn. \n--only now they stop moving. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER, tense, adjusting his bifocals. \nCUT TO: \nA SERIES OF HEADLINES pertaining to Annie Wilkes' murder trial. \nCUT TO: \nA HEADLINE which reads, \"DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE.\" \nUnder a PICTURE OF ANNIE on the courthouse steps, we see a CAPTION: \"Wilkes told reporters on the courthouse steps, 'There is a higher justice than that of man; I will be judged by Him.'\" \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER. He takes the 3 x 5 card out of his pocket. \nCUT TO: \nThe CARD--on it is printed the exact quote we just saw in the paper. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER, sitting there, staring at the quote. \nBUSTER Interesting. \nHOLD ON HIS FACE, then-- \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, carrying a bag of feed, followed by MISERY, the sow, comes into view. She slows, smiles, waves-- \nANNIE Hi, Punkin. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, staring out at her. \nANNIE Give us a smile? (Paul gives her the finger. She laughs) Such a kidder. \nAs she exits our view-- \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, lifting the typewriter and repeatedly raising it over his head, this time without any difficulty. \nCUT TO: \nTHE GENERAL STORE IN SILVER CREEK. EARLY AFTERNOON. \nBUSTER enters. The place is empty. It's one of those wonderful spots that stocks pretty much everything in what seems like complete disarray. Buster goes to the coffee urn behind the counter, helps himself. He speaks to the guy who sits behind the counter nearby; these two have known each other forever. \nBUSTER Hey, Pete. \nPETE Buster. \nBUSTER Answer me a couple things? \nPETE If I can. \nBUSTER Do you have any of those new Paul Sheldon books? \nPETE We had a batch. Sold 'em all in three days. \nBUSTER You wouldn't happen to remember if Miz Wilkes bought one, would you? \nPETE Are you kidding? Every time that fella writes a book, she makes me set aside the first copy. \nBUSTER opens the cash register, drops his coffee money inside, closes the register. \nBUSTER Has she been buying any odd things lately? \nPETE Miz Wilkes? Same old stuff. (beat) --Lest you call paper odd. \nBUSTER Newspapers? \n", "test3_id": 3206}

{"train": "Misery - by William Goldman \n\"MISERY\" \nby \nWilliam Goldman \nBased on the Novel by \nStephen King \nFADE IN ON: \nA SINGLE CIGARETTE. A MATCH. A HOTEL ICE BUCKET that holds a bottle of champagne. The cigarette is unlit. The match is of the kitchen variety. The champagne, unopened, is Dom Perignon. There is only one sound at first: a strong WIND-- \n--now another sound, sharper--a sudden burst of TYPING as we \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nPAUL SHELDON typing at a table in his hotel suite. It's really a cabin that's part of a lodge. Not an ornate place. Western themed. \nHe is framed by a window looking out at some gorgeous mountains. It's afternoon. The sky is grey. Snow is scattered along the ground. We're out west somewhere. The WIND grows stronger--there could be a storm. \nPAUL pays no attention to what's going on outside as he continues to type. \nHe's the hero of what follows. Forty-two, he's got a good face, one with a certain mileage to it. We are not, in other words, looking at a virgin. He's been a novelist for eighteen years and for half that time, the most recent half, a remarkably successful one. \nHe pauses for a moment, intently, as if trying to stare a hole in the paper. Now his fingers fly, and there's another burst of TYPING. He studies what he's written, then-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE PAPER, as he rolls it out of the machine, puts it on the table, prints, in almost childlike letters, these words: \nTHE END \nCUT TO: \nA PILE OF MANUSCRIPT at the rear of the table. He puts this last page on, gets it straight and in order, hoists it up, folds it to his chest, the entire manuscript--hundreds of pages. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, as he holds his book to him. He is, just for a brief moment, moved. \nCUT TO: \nA SUITCASE across the room. PAUL goes to it, opens it and pulls something out from inside: a battered red leather briefcase. Now he takes his manuscript, carefully opens the briefcase, gently puts the manuscript inside. He closes it, and the way he handles it, he might almost be handling a child. Now he crosses over, opens the champagne, pours himself a single glass, lights the one cigarette with the lone match-- there is a distinct feeling of ritual about this. He inhales deeply, makes a toasting gesture, then drinks, smokes, smiles. \nHOLD BRIEFLY, then-- \nCUT TO: \nLODGE - DAY \nPAUL--exiting his cabin. He stops, makes a snowball, throws it, hitting a sign. \nPAUL Still got it. \nHe throws a suitcase into the trunk of his '65 MUSTANG and, holding his leather case, he hops into the car and drives away. \nCUT TO: \nA SIGN that reads \"Silver Creek Lodge.\" Behind the sign is the hotel itself--old, desolate. Now the '65 Mustang comes out of the garage, guns ahead toward the sign. As \"Shotgun\" by Jr. Walker and the Allstars starts, he heads off into the mountains. \nCUT TO: \nTHE SKY. Gun-metal grey. The clouds seem pregnant with snow. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, driving the Mustang, the battered briefcase on the seat beside him. \nCUT TO: \nTHE ROAD AHEAD. Little dainty flakes of snow are suddenly visible. \nCUT TO: \nTHE CAR, going into a curve and \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, driving, and as he comes out of the curve, a stunned look hits his face as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE ROAD AHEAD--and here it comes--a mountain storm; it's as if the top has been pulled off the sky and with no warning whatsoever, we're into a blizzard and \nCUT TO: \nANNIE (Gently, her fingers go to his eyelids, close them) Now you mustn't tire yourself. You've got to rest, you almost died. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE: CLOSE UP. Sometimes her face shows the most remarkable compassion. It does now. \nHOLD ON IT briefly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE UP ON PILLS IN ANNIE'S HAND \nANNIE (O.S.) Open wide. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM \nHe lies in bed. His fever is gone, but he's terribly weak. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE. As she lays the pills on PAUL'S TONGUE, she gives him a glass of water from the nearby bed table. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, swallowing eagerly. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, watching him, sympathetically. \nANNIE Your legs just sing grand opera when you move, don't they? (Paul says nothing, but his pain is clear) It's not going to hurt forever, Paul, I promise you. \nPAUL Will I be able to walk? \nANNIE Of course you will. And your arm will be fine, too. Your shoulder was dislocated pretty badly, but I finally popped it back in there. (proudly) But what I'm most proud of is the work I did on those legs. Considering what I had around the house, I don't think there's a doctor who could have done any better. \nAnd now suddenly she flicks off the blankets, uncovering his body. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, staring, stunned at the bottom half of his body as we \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S LEGS. From the knees down he resembles an Egyptian mummy--she's splinted them with slim steel rods that look like the hacksawed remains of aluminum crutches and there's taping circling around. \nFrom the kness up they're all swollen and throbbing and horribly bruised and discolored. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, lying back, stunned with disbelief. \nANNIE It's not nearly as bad as it looks. You have a compound fracture of the tibia in both legs, and the fibula in the left leg is fractured too. I could hear the bones moving, so it's best for your legs to remain immobile. And as soon as the roads open, I'll take you to a hospital. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE: CLOSE UP \nANNIE In the meantime, you've got a lot of recovering to do, and I consider it an honor that you'll do it in my home. \nHOLD on her ecstatic face. \nThen-- \nCUT TO: \nMISERY'S PERFECT FACE. We're back in SINDELL's office in New York. The office looks just the same, posters and manuscripts all over. But she doesn't. \nShe holds the phone and she is fidgety, insecure. \nSINDELL This is Marcia Sindell calling from New York City. I'd like to speak to the Silver Creek Chief of Police or the Sheriff. \nMALE VOICE (O.S.) Which one do you want? \nSINDELL Whichever one's not busy. \nCUT TO: \nSMALL OFFICE IN SILVER CREEK \n...with a view of the mountains. \nA MARVELOUS LOOKING MAN sits at a desk, by himself, holding the phone. In his sixties, he's still as bright, fast and sassy as he was half-a-lifetime ago. Never mind what his name is, everyone calls him BUSTER. \nBUSTER I'm pretty sure they 're both not busy, Ms. Sindell, since they're both me. I also happen to be President of the Policeman's Benefit Association, Chairman of the Patrolman's Retirement Fund, and if you need a good fishing guide, you could do a lot worse; call me Buster, everybody does, what can I do for you? \nCUT TO: \nANNIE (smiles) Don't move now--wouldn't want to hurt this neck-- (shaving away) Well, the other afternoon I was on my way home, and there you were, leaving the Lodge, and I wondered why a literary genius would go for a drive when there was a big storm coming. \nPAUL I didn't know it was going to be a big storm. \nANNIE Lucky for you, I did. (pauses) Lucky for me too. Because now you're alive and you can write more books. Oh, Paul, I've read everything of Yours, but the Misery novels... \nCUT TO: \nANNIE: CLOSE UP \nANNIE I know them all by heart, Paul, all eight of them. I love them so. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, looking at her. There's something terribly touching about her now. \nPAUL You're very kind... \nANNIE And you're very brilliant, and you must be a good man, or you could never have created such a wondrous, loving creature as Misery Chastain. (runs her fingers over his cheek) Like a baby. (smiles) All done. (starts to dab away the last bits of soap) \nANNIE starts cleaning up. \nPAUL When do you think the phone lines'll be back up? I have to call my daughter, and I should call New York and let my agent know I'm breathing. \nANNIE It shouldn't be too much longer. (gently) Once the roads are open, the lines'll be up in no time. If you give me their numbers, I'll keep trying them for you. (suddenly almost embarrassed) Could I ask you a favor? (Paul nods) I noticed in your case there was a new Paul Sheldon book and... (hesitant) and I wondered if maybe... (her voice trails off) \nPAUL You want to read it? \nANNIE (quietly) If you wouldn't mind. \nPAUL I have a hard and fast rule about who can read my stuff at this early stage--only my editor, my agent, and anyone who saves me from freezing to death in a car wreck. \nANNIE (genuinely thrilled) You'll never realize what a rare treat you've given me. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL. His eyes close briefly, he grimaces. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, watching him, concerned. She glances at her watch. \nANNIE Boy, it's like clockwork, the way your pain comes--I'll get you your Novril, Paul. Forgive me for prattling away and making you feel all oogy. \nShe turns and goes out of the room. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, watching her. \nANNIE What's your new book called? \nPAUL I don't have a title yet. \nANNIE What's it about? \nPAUL (fast) It's crazy, but I don't really know, I mean I haven't written anything but \"Misery\" for so long that--you read it you can tell me what you think it's about. Maybe you can come up with a title. \nANNIE (in the doorway) Oh, like I could do that? \nCUT TO: \nTHE MANAGER'S OFFICE AT THE SILVER CREEK LODGE \nSmall, neat, one window--outside, snow covers all. \nBUSTER AND LIBBY, THE MANAGER, are going over books and records. Libby is an old guy, walks with a cane. \nLIBBY Nothing unusual about Mr. Sheldon's leaving, Buster--you can tell by the champagne. \nBUSTER Maybe you can, Libby. \nLIBBY No, see, he always ordered a bottle of Dom Perignon when he was ready to go. Then he'd pay up and be out the door. \nBUSTER No long-distance phone calls, Federal Express packages--anything at all out of the ordinary? \nLIBBY (head shake) I don't think Mr. Sheldon likes for things to be out of the ordinary. Considering who he is and all, famous and all, he doesn't have airs. Drives the same car out from New York each time--'65 Mustang--said it helps him think. He was always a good guest, never made a noise, never bothered a soul. Sure hope nothing happened to him. \nBUSTER So do I... \nLIBBY I'll bet that old Mustang's pulling into New York right now. \nBUSTER I'm sure you're right. \nBut you can tell he's not sure at all as we \nCUT TO: \nA SPOON FILLED TO THE BRIM WITH BEEF BARLEY SOUP \nANNIE I thought it was time you two should meet. Paul, say hello to my favorite beast in all the world, my sow, Misery. \nPAUL Misery? \nCUT TO: \nTHE PIG, snorting around the room. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL AND ANNIE, watching it. \nANNIE Yes. I told you I was your number- one fan. \nPAUL I'm getting to believe you. \nANNIE This farm was getting kind of dreary, what with just the few cows and chickens and me-- (happy) But when I got Misery here, everything Changed--she just makes me smile so. \nPAUL She's a fine... uh... pig is what she is... \nANNIE (scooping up the pig, holding it tight as she stands by Paul) I'm on page three-hundred now, Paul, and it's better than perfect--it's divine. What's the ceiling that dago painted? \nPAUL The Sistine Chapel? \nANNIE Yeah, that and Misery's Child--those are the only two divine things ever in this world... \nPAUL watches as the pig skitters out of the room with ANNIE in pursuit, happily imitating the pig. \nANNIE Woink! Whoink! Whuh-Whuh-WHOINK! \nCUT TO: \nPAUL staring after them--what the hell was that? \nCUT TO: \nTHE WINDOW. DUSK. \nANNIE'S VOICE is heard softly. \nANNIE When my husband left me... I wasn't prepared, it wasn't an easy time... \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nANNIE, standing at the window, her back to the room. \nIn bed, PAUL is dealing with a bedpan, peeing. \nANNIE For a while I thought I might go crazy. \nPAUL I know how that can be. \nANNIE I don't know about you, but what I did to get through it was I dove into work--days, nights--night shifts can be lonely at a hospital. I did a lot of reading. That was hen I first discovered Misery. She made me so happy. She made me forget all my problems. (She smiles now) 'Course, I suppose you had a little something to do with that too. \nThere is a peeing sound. \nPAUL Yeah, well... \nHe is embarrassed. \nANNIE (She isn't) I just kept reading them over and over. I know when I finish this one-- and I've only got two chapters to go-- I'll just turn right to the front page and start reading it again. \nPAUL I'm... \nANNIE (She turns around, moves to the bed) Done? \nPAUL Yeah, thanks. \nANNIE No problem. \nAs she takes the bedpan... \nANNIE Don't get me wrong. I'm not against marriage per se. But it would take a pretty special guy to make me want to go down the aisle again. \nPAUL Well, it's not something you should enter into lightly. \nANNIE It boils down to respect. People just don't respect the institution of marriage any more. They have no sense of real commitment. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, attempting to smile. There is not much he can say to this. \nANNIE I'd love to stay here and chat, but I'm right at the end and I gotta find out what happens. \nPAUL Well, I hope you like it. \nANNIE Of course I'll like it. Misery's about to have her child. What's it gonna be, a boy or a girl? Ooh, don't tell me. \nWith that, she exits. \n--young, Oriental, female, male, pretty, sad, black, not so pretty, happy, white, old--what we HEAR is this: \n\"...You've changed my life...\" \n\"...I'm your number one fan...\" \n\"...I'm a really big fan of yours...\" \n\"...I'm your biggest fan...\" \n\"...Don't ever stop writing those Misery books...\" \n\"...I've read all your books, but the Misery's... well...\" \n\"...I'm your number one fan...\" \n\"...You've given me such pleasure...\" \n\"...I feel like you're writing just for me...\" \nAnd now, it gets kicked up in speed and all goes faster, many times overlapping. \n\"...I love you... I'm your number one fan... I'm your biggest fan... We love you... number one... love you... biggest... love you... number one... number one... you poor dear thing...\" \nThis last was said by Annie, out of focus, and for a moment, she stays that way-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE ROOM, AS IT SNAPS BACK INTO FOCUS--ANNIE is standing by the bed. It is dusk. \nShe wears a dark blue dress and a hat with a sprig of flowers. Her eyes are bright and vivacious--the fact is, this is the prettiest ANNIE WILKES has ever looked. \nANNIE What are you doing on the floor? (crossing to the bed) It's my fault. If I'd had a proper hospital bed, this never would have happened. Here, let me help you back in. (She lifts him back into the bed, which causes considerable pain) I know this hurts, but it'll only take a few seconds. There you go. Comfy? \nPAUL (in pain) Perfect. \nANNIE You're such a kidder. I have a big surprise for you. But first there's something you must do. \nPAUL I don't suppose I could have a little snack while I wait for the surprise? \nANNIE I'll get you everything you want, but you must listen first. Sometimes my thinking is a little muddy, I accept that. It's why I couldn't remember all those things they were asking me on the witness stand in Denver. \nNow she turns, goes to the doorway, keeping on talking. She is never out of sight. \nANNIE But this time I thought clearly. I asked God about you and God said \"I delivered him unto you so that you may show him the way.\" \nPAUL Show me the way? \nANNIE Yes. \nShe exits and re-enters wheeling something toward his bed. It's a charcoal barbecue, the kind you use in summer for cooking hamburgers. She holds several items in her arms: a box of Diamond Blue Tip wooden matches, a can of lighter fluid. And most noticeably, Paul's manuscript. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE AND PAUL. He watches, mute, as she takes off the grill, puts the manuscript into the barbecue itself where the charcoal goes, spritzes it with lighter fluid. The grill is close enough to the bed for him to reach out and drop a match. \nPAUL When I mentioned a snack, I was thinking more along the lines of a cheese and crackers kind of thing. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, looking at him. \nANNIE Paul, this is no time for jokes. You must rid the world of this filth. \nShe hands him the box of kitchen matches. \nPAUL You want me to burn my book? \nANNIE (she nods) Yes. \nPAUL You want me to burn my book? \nANNIE I know this may be difficult for you, but it's for the best. \nPAUL This isn't difficult, my agent's made dozens of copies. There's gonna be an auction on this, and every publishing house in New York is reading it now. So if you want me to burn it, fine. You're not ridding the world of anything. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, watching him. \nANNIE (quietly) Then light the match, Paul. \nPAUL No big deal. \nANNIE So you've indicated. Do it. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MATCHES. PAUL'S HANDS are starting to tremble now. He can't do it. \nANNIE taking  a step toward the window, stopping for a moment. The sound we're hearing is a motor. A HELICOPTER MOTOR. And it's getting louder. Annie goes to the window now, looks toward the sky as we \nCUT TO: \nA HELICOPTER flying along. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE HELICOPTER \nBUSTER and a PILOT are in the machine. Buster has a pair of binoculars looped around his neck, a map rumpled in his lap. \nBUSTER (pointing out) That's the Steadman place up there. (The pilot nods. Buster points again) The only other place up here is the Wilkes farm. \nAnother nod. The PILOT points down. BUSTER stares through the binoculars. \nWHAT HE SEES: ANNIE'S JEEP parked in front of her house. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE HELICOPTER \nBUSTER That's no '65 Mustang. There's nothing else out this way--circle on back. \nAs the pilot starts to change direction \nCUT TO: \nANNIE at the window, watching, as the helicopter turns, starts off. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, listening as the MOTOR sound recedes. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, staring out the window. \nANNIE I do believe the winters are getting shorter and shorter every year. People say it has something to do with the ozone layer. What do you think? \nPAUL I don't know. \nANNIE Yeah, well, it's a theory. Here's your Novril. (she wheels the barbecue to the door; stops) How does tuna casserole sound for dinner? \nPAUL Great. \nShe exits. PAUL takes the two Novril, stares at them, then deliberately tucks them under his mattress. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT. \nAs PAUL is finishing the last of his tuna casserole. There are two Novrils on his tray. We hear strains of TV GAME SHOW THEME MUSIC. These sounds are not surprising. Paul has heard them before. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE'S ROOM. NIGHT. \nIt is much smaller than Paul's and filled with religious bric-a-brac, pictures of Paul Sheldon, and a TV on a portable stand. Annie lies in bed, with an open bag of Cheetos resting on her stomach and a big quart-sized plastic bottle of Coke on the nightstand. As she munches away, she is heavily engrossed in her favorite TV show, \"The Love Connection.\" As Chuck Woolery extracts the embarrassing details of a couple's romantic interlude, we \nCUT TO: \nPaul faintly hearing the sounds of the TV. He has now finished eating. He takes the two Novril from under the mattress. He then undoes the sheet, takes his fork and delicately pokes a hole in the mattress, then stuffs all four pills back into the hole. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nFARMHOUSE \nComing up to dawn. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S DOOR slowly opening. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, staring at  the door. \nCUT TO: \nWHEELS, seen from underneath the bed, being rolled around the foot of the bed. We realize PAUL is in a wheelchair with ANNIE pushing him. \nANNIE See, isn't this nice? \nPAUL Great. I've always wanted to visit the other side of the room. \nANNIE And look what I've got for you. An electric razor so you can shave yourself now. \nPAUL If I knew this was gonna be the surprise, you could've gotten me to burn all my books. \nPAUL, crying out in pain as he lands. He lies there for a moment. Little droplets of sweat are on his forehead now. He is hurting. \nHe closes his eyes, gathering strength-- \n--and then slowly, very slowly, inch by inch, he moves his body across the floor toward the kitchen door. \nCUT TO: \nTHE KITCHEN DOOR. It's still a long way away. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, ignoring his pain, his awkwardness, making his body move. \nCUT TO: \nTHE KITCHEN DOOR. Closer now. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, growing pale, but he won't stop, and now the door is just ahead of him, and with his good arm he reaches out and up and grabs the doorknob-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE KITCHEN DOOR. Locked solid. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL: CLOSE UP. The disappointment and anger is plain on his face. His arm drops. He lies still for a moment, panting from his effort. Then-- \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, and his eyes are wide for a moment. You can feel his wild excitement, as we \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nSitting on the counter: A SET OF CARVING KNIVES sticking out of a slotted wooden block. \nThey seem to be out of reach, but that doesn't stop him. He starts to crawl over to the counter. \nCUT TO: \nTHE ROAD \nANNIE is driving along in her Cherokee. She is heading home. \nCUT TO: \nTHE KITCHEN \nNow at the counter, PAUL tries to pull himself up with his one good arm, but even though he is able to chin himself up to the top of the counter, he is still unable to reach the knives. He makes a desperate attempt which sends him crashing to the floor. \nAs he starts to force his way up again--from outside there comes a sound--the motor of a car. \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE ANNIE'S \nANNIE, driving up to the house. \nCUT TO: \nTHE KITCHEN \nPAUL, throwing himself back to the floor, starting a wild crawl back across the kitchen toward the wheelchair and \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE ANNIE'S \nANNIE, getting out of her Jeep and \nCUT TO: \nKITCHEN \nPAUL, crawling, crawling and \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE ANNIE'S \nANNIE, walking around to the back of the Jeep and \nCUT TO: \nKITCHEN \nPAUL, scrambling wildly up into his wheelchair, starting to get it turned and \nCUT TO: \nANNIE. She stares a moment more, then turns, starts for the door. \nANNIE (upset) It just breaks my heart to see you like this... \nCUT TO: \nPAUL watching, and the instant she is out the door in the hallway, he stuffs the Novril into his pants. \nANNIE (O.S.) (coming closer) I've done a lot of thinking on the drive... \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, entering the room, the Novril in her hand. She is genuinely contrite. \nANNIE ...and I'm absolutely convinced that the main reason I've never been more popular is because of my temper. You must be so mad at me. The truth now. \nShe hands him the pills. And rolls him over to the bed. \nPAUL Well, I don't  hold grudges. After all, who doesn't let off a little steam once in a while. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL putting the pills in his mouth, as she picks him up from the chair and puts him gently down in bed. \nANNIE My genius needs his rest before he writes. \nShe hands him a pad and pencil. \nANNIE Here, in case you think of any ideas. \nPAUL Yeah, well I wouldn't expect too much. \nANNIE Don't be silly. You'll be brilliant. Think of me as your inspiration. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DOORWAY, as ANNIE starts to it. \nANNIE I have faith in you... (beat) ...my darling... \nOn that she turns--for the first time, a coquettish look comes to her face. \nANNIE Catch this-- (she throws him a kiss--it's grotesque) --ummmm-wahhhh. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, summoning up all his courage, as he mimes catching it and forces a smile on. She waves, closes the door. \nHOLD ON PAUL. The smile dies. He reaches in and pulls the two Novril capsules out of his mouth. Now-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE SOUND OF A HELICOPTER \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE HELICOPTER \nBUSTER AND PILOT flying along. Buster is all bundled up as he stares out, using the binoculars... \nCUT TO: \nSOMETHING SHINY reflecting the sun. \nHOLD AS IT ALMOST BLINDS US--we're looking at the part of Paul's Mustang that was revealed by the snow when Buster almost found the car. \nBUSTER (to Pilot) Walter, we could be skipping lunch today. \nCUT TO: \nCRASH SITE \nPaul's car being hoisted by chains from the ground and, as it starts to rise up into the afternoon air... \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nTHE AREA BY THE CAR--BUSTER is there and a bunch of STATE POLICEMEN and various MEDIA PEOPLE are there--Buster stands with the STATE POLICE CHIEF watching as the car is hoisted via derrick; the sound of the powerful MOTOR lifting the car is enormous and as the car keeps rising higher and higher and PEOPLE take pictures and stare and \nCUT TO: \nTHE STATE POLICE CHIEF is addressing maybe a dozen REPORTERS. It's very cold. BUSTER stands slightly away from the group. \nSTATE POLICE CHIEF The presumption must now be that Paul Sheldon is dead. We know he somehow crawled out of his car. But we have been unable to locate his body in the vicinity of the crash. We also know if anyone had found him, they would have taken him to an area hospital. His body is undoubtedly out there buried somewhere in the snow. We'll find him after the first thaw--unless the animals have gotten to him first. (beat) I'll take questions. \nAfter the first sentence, a very cold and very unhappy BUSTER leaves the gathering. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \nPAUL. He closes his eyes briefly, mutters something, kind of nods, opens his eyes, grabs for another piece of paper, rolls it in and starts mechanically to type. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA NEW PIECE OF PAPER with the words \"Chapter Two\" and a half paragraph of writing as we \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nPAUL WORKING in his room. ANNIE  enters, the first pages of manuscript in her hands. It's dusk. \nANNIE I'm sorry, Paul. This is all wrong, you'll have to do it over again. \nPAUL (totally stunned) What? What happened to \"I'll treasure whatever you do?\" \nANNIE Paul, it's not worthy of you. Throw it all out except for the part of naming that gravedigger after me. You can leave that in. \nPAUL I really value your criticism, but maybe you're being a little hasty here. \nANNIE Paul, what you've written just isn't fair. \nPAUL --not fair? \nANNIE That's right--when I was growing up in Bakersfield, my favorite thing in all the world was to go to the movies on Saturday afternoons for the chapter plays... \nPAUL (it just comes out) --cliff-hangers-- \nANNIE (suddenly angry) I know that, Mister Man--they also call them serials. I'm not stupid, you know. (and she's a child again) Anyway, my favorite was Rocket Man, and once it was a no-brakes chapter, the bad guys stuck him in a car on a mountain road and knocked him out and welded the doors shut and tore out the brakes and started him to his death and he woke up and tried to steer and tried to get out, but the car went off a cliff before he could escape and it crashed and burned and--I was so upset and excited and the next week you better believe I was first in line and they always start with the end of the last week and there was Rocket Man trying to get out, and here came the cliff and JUST BEFORE the car went off he jumped free and all the kids cheered-- (standing up now) --but I didn't cheer, I stood right up and started shouting, \"This isn't what happened last week--have you all got amnesia?--THEY JUST CHEATED US--THIS WASN'T FAIR--\" \nANNIE: CLOSE UP. Still in her childhood reverie. Shouting: \nANNIE \"HE DIDN'T GET OUT OF THE COCKADOODIE CAR!\" \nPAUL They always cheated like that in cliff-- (stops himself) --chapter plays. \nANNIE But not you. Not with my Misery. Remember, Ian did ride for Dr. Cleary at the end of the last book, but his horse fell jumping that fence and Ian broke his shoulder and his ribs and lay there all night in the ditch so he never reached the doctor, so there couldn't have been any \"experimental blood transfusion\" that saved her life. Misery was buried in the ground at the end, Paul, so you'll have to start there. \nAs she goes-- \nPAUL Look at this, I've got Lizzie Borden for an editor, here. \nPAUL slumps, staring barefully at the typewriter. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. NEXT MORNING. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM. DAY. \nPAUL is at the table. He takes the Novril off his breakfast tray, wheels over to the bed, and stuffs them into the mattress. He hears FOOTSTEPS coming down the hall. He smoothly wheels back to the table. A pause. \nANNIE enters to remove the tray. \nANNIE What's the matter, Paul? You haven't written a word. \nPAUL I can't write this anymore. \nANNIE Don't be silly. Of course you can. \nPAUL I'm telling you, I can't. \nANNIE You can--you have the \"gotta\"-- \nPAUL The what? \nANNIE The \"gotta.\" Remember, you talked about it in Playboy magazine. You said there's a million things you can't do in this world; you can't hit a curve ball, you can't fix a leaky faucet or make a marriage work-- but there's one thing you always have, and that's the power of the \"gotta.\" \nPAUL I said that? \nANNIE You said you can make it so they gotta turn the page. You know, \"I 'gotta' know will she live,\" \"I 'gotta' know will he catch the killer.\" \"I gotta see how this chapter ends.\" You said it. I don't usually buy that magazine. I only got it, 'cause they were interviewing you. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL: CLOSE UP. Blinking. \nPAUL (quietly) What about a bee...? \nANNIE What? \nPAUL Nothing. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER Hey, Jim, what's doing? Uh-huh... uh- huh... Jim, we've been over this. If you're gonna have benches in front of your store, people are gonna sit on them. I don't like him either, but I'm not going to come over there and tell him to move. Give my best to Denise. Bye. \nVIRGINIA (looking through the books; all paperback Misery novels) Well, whoever she is, she sure likes to read a lot. \nBUSTER Virginia, I'm flattered you think I got that much energy. I just figured if I can't find Paul Sheldon, at least I can find out what he wrote about. \nVIRGINIA What do you expect to find? A story about a guy who drove his car off a cliff in a snowstorm? \nBUSTER Now, you see, it's that kind of sarcasm that's given our marriage real spice. \nCUT TO: \nSTUDY. NIGHT. \nPAUL is sitting at a table that Annie has set up with her best china and silverware. It is as romantic as Annie Wilkes gets. ANNIE enters, carrying a basket of rolls. She sits and serves Paul. \nANNIE I hope you like it. \nPAUL It looks wonderful. And so do you. \nANNIE Oh... \nThey eat in awkward silence. Finally: \nPAUL I've never had meatloaf this good, what do you do to it? \nANNIE My secret is I only use fresh tomatoes, never canned. And to give it that little extra zip, I mix in some Spam with the ground beef. \nPAUL Oh. (pause) You can't get this in a restaurant in New York. \nAfter another pause: \nPAUL Annie, I think we should have a toast. \nANNIE A toast? \nPAUL Yes, to Misery. Let me pour you some more wine. \nPaul pours more of the Gallo wine, then raises his glass. \nANNIE To Misery. \nPAUL Wait, let's do this right. Do you have any candles? \nANNIE Oh, I don't know. I think so. I'll go look. \nShe exits into the kitchen. PAUL quickly pulls the packet filled with Novril powder from his pants. He empties it into her glass of wine, stuffs the empty packet back into his pants, talking the whole time: \nPAUL Did you study decorating, or do you just have a flair? \nANNIE Oh, you. I just picked things up over the years. \nPAUL Well, it certainly says you. \nANNIE You really think so? \nPAUL Absolutely. Listen, if you can't find any, it's okay. I just thought it might be nice. \nANNIE re-enters with a candle. \nANNIE Are you kidding? If anyone ever told me that one day I'd be having a candlelit dinner with Paul Sheldon in my own house, I woulda checked both legs to see which one was being pulled. Will this do? \nPAUL It's perfect. \nShe places the candle on the table. With a slight tremor in her hand, she lights the candle. PAUL raises his glass. \nPAUL To Misery and Annie Wilkes, who brought her back to life. \nANNIE raises her glass. \nANNIE Oh, Paul, every time I think about it, I get goosebumps. \nThey clink glasses. \nAnd with that, her emotions having gotten the best of her, she knocks over the candle. In trying to right the situation, she places her glass back down, and as she reaches for the candle, she knocks over her glass, spilling the wine. \nANNIE (wiping up the spilled wine with her napkin) Oh, God, what have I done? I'm so sorry, Paul. I ruined your beautiful toast. Will you ever forgive me? Here, let me pour another one. (she does) Can we pretend this never happened? To Misery? \nPAUL To Misery. \nSo they drink their wine. \nCUT TO: \nOUTSIDE THE FARMHOUSE. DAY. \nThe snow, although still present, has melted somewhat. And starting now and continuing throughout is this: the sound of typing. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT. \nPaul, staring and \nCUT TO: \nTHE PILE, growing, growing and \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S FINGERS \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM \nPAUL, ripping open a new ream of paper... \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM. DUSK. \nHis lips move silently. He's not even aware of it as he nods and... \nCUT TO: \nTHE PAPER IN THE TYPEWRITER, line after line being written. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nPaul's face at DAY, NIGHT, and DUSK in rapid succession, ending with \nCUT TO: \nANNIE'S FARMHOUSE. NIGHT. \nLightning! Giant deep rolls of THUNDER as RAIN begins... \nCUT TO: \nTYPEWRITER being lifted out of frame, then back in, then out again. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM. NIGHT. \nThe pile of manuscript has doubled. Maybe two hundred pages. \nPAUL, with some effort, is pumping the typewriter up and down. Finally, he places it back down and puts his arm back in the sling. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, looking outside breifly. \nCUT TO: \nTHE RAIN. Worse. The SOUND hit s the roof of the house, hits the window. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, lumbering in--she's never looked like this: She's wearing her slippers and her pink quilted housecoat. Her eyes are without life. Her hair, loose and straggly, hangs around her face. Slowly, like a  robot, she goes to PAUL, who looks silently up at her. \nANNIE Here's your pills. \nShe drops them on the table. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, as the pills hit his chest and bounce into his lap. \nPAUL Annie, what is it? \nCUT TO: \nANNIE \nANNIE (half turns away, turns back, gestures outside) The rain... sometimes it gives me the blues. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE: CLOSE UP. And suddenly it's as if she's been turned off, gone lifeless. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, staring at her. No sound but the rain. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, glancing around-- \n--and there it is, on a coffee table in the living room. Also on the table are a roll of Scotch tape, a pair of scissors, and a copy of Newsweek. Paul wheels toward the table and the book, which is as big as a folio Shakespeare play and as thick as a family Bible. \nCUT TO: \nTHE LIVING ROOM \nPAUL, opening the book. \nCUT TO: \nTHE FIRST PAGE OF THE BOOK, as Paul opens it. It's a newspaper clipping as is almost all of what follows. A small article: simply a birth announcement for Anne Marie Wilkes. \nPAUL turns the page. This headline reads: \"Investment Banker Carl Wilkes Dies in Freak Fall.\" \n\"USC Nursing Student Dies in Freak Fall.\" That's the headline on the next page. \nNow: \"Miss Wilkes is Nursing School Honors Graduate.\" \nPaul turns the page. \nManchester, New Hampshire, Union Leader: \"Ernest Gonyar, 79, Dies After Long Illness.\" \nNow that phrase seems to be what catches our eye--\"after long illness\" is from the next article. \"Long illness\" from the one after that. Then, on the next page, a variation: \"Short Illness.\" \nNow we're in Pennsylvania: \"New Hospital Staff Announced.\" \nAnd here come those phrases again on page after page--\"After Long Illness.\" \"After Long Illness.\" \n\"After Long Illness.\" \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, transfixed; he keeps on turning the pages--the states keep changing, moving west. Pennsylvania to Minnesota, Minnesota to North Dakota. And always the clippings reporting deaths and deaths and-- \n--and now we're in Colorado. \"NEW HEAD MATERNITY NURSE NAMED.\" And now the dead are young and helpless; babies. More and more of them. \nPAUL (stunned) Holy shit. \nThen a headline which reads: \n\"HEAD MATERNITY NURSE QUESTIONED ON INFANT DEATHS\" \nNext page: \"MISS WILKES RELEASED.\" \nNext page: \"THREE MORE INFANTS DIE.\" \nNext page, at last: \"DRAGON LADY ARRESTED.\" \nThen a photo: the front page of the Rocky Mountain Gazette. Annie on the courthouse steps. \"DRAGON LADY CLAIMS INNOCENCE,\" under which there is a statement by Annie Wilkes. \nPaul turns quickly to the next page and a very large headline: \n\"DRAGON LADY FOUND NOT GUILTY\" \nPAUL just sits there, shaking his head in bewilderment. \nCUT TO: \nTHE BOOK, as Paul turns the LAST page. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, stunned and now we find out why, as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE PAGE IN THE BOOK. It's an article from Newsweek magazine, a picture of Paul's car being hauled up out of the snow. Above it this caption: \"Presumed Dead--Paul Sheldon.\" \nCUT TO: \nPAUL. Slamming the book shut, putting it back on the coffee table, then quickly turning his wheelchair as we \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, steering his wheelchair toward the front door. He tries to position himself for a surprise attack of ANNIE, but he can't find a way to get close enough. The wheelchair is too cumbersome. He looks around and decides to head back to his room. He is faced with the same problem there--so he struggles into bed and, lying on his back, he rests the knife on his chest and stares up at the ceiling. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPAUL'S WINDOW, hours later. The rain has stopped. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL--trying to stay awake. After a few beats, he hears something. It's the sound of a CAR PULLING UP. \nHEADLIGHTS can be seen flashing through the window. PAUL grips the knife and hides it under the covers. The sound of a CAR DOOR OPENING AND CLOSING, then FOOTSTEPS. \nANNIE Shh, darling, trust me-- (taking aim at his ankle) It's for the best. \nShe takes the sledgehammer back. \nPAUL Annie, for God's sake, please. \nAs ANNIE swings, the sledgehammer makes contact with the ankle. It breaks with a sharp CRACK. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL: CLOSE UP, shrieking. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, moving to the other side of the bed. \nANNIE Almost done, just one more. \nAnd as she breaks the other ankle, PAUL shrieks even louder. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE: CLOSE UP. \nANNIE God, I love you... \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S FACE. He is beyond agony. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nFor a long moment, nothing. \nThen... a FAINT SOUND. After a moment, it begins to become more intrusive and we can tell what it is: a car horn HONKING. \nFADE IN ON: \nSILVER CREEK and ANNIE in her Cherokee, HONKING for another car to get a move on. \nCUT TO: \nA HAND AND A COIN MOVING ACROSS IT, from finger to finger. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nBUSTER, sitting by the front window of his office, reading The Rocky Mountain Gazette. \nHe watches idly as ANNIE yells out the window to the car in front of her. THE DRIVER of the car yells back. Annie yells louder. The Driver guns off, and Annie pulls into the parking space next to the General Store. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, getting out, shaking a fist at the other car, calling out, \"You poop!\" She enters the store. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER, staring straight ahead. Something is gnawing at him. \nCUT TO: \nVIRGINIA, in his office, tidying the desk. BUSTER enters, looks angry. \nBUSTER Just leave it, all right? \nVIRGINIA Oh, I like that tone. \nBUSTER How many times do I have to tell you-- I have a system here. (rooting through a pile of papers) Where the hell is that thing? \nVIRGINIA What thing? \nBUSTER That thing. (finding what he's looking for, a 3 x 5 card) Here it is. Right where it's supposed to be. \nVIRGINIA What is it? \nBUSTER I'm not sure. Maybe nothing. \nVIRGINIA It's good you found it. \nBUSTER There's that spice again. \nAs BUSTER leaves, VIRGINIA goes back to tidying the desk. \nCUT TO: \nA LARGE LIBRARY as Buster leaves his car, hurries inside and \nCUT TO: \nLIBRARY STACKS \nPETE (mimes typing) No, the typing kind. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER: CLOSE UP \nBUSTER Oh. That kind. Nothing odd about that. \nHe cannot hide his excitement now as we-- \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, entering Paul's room. He lies back in the wheelchair, eyes closed. Liberace music playing in the background. From the start, PAUL'S TONE is different--strong, he's in control. \nANNIE Paul, don't you think it's time for you to start writing again? It's been over a week. \nPAUL I don't know, it's weird, but a couple of broken bones hasn't done a lot for my creative juices. Get the fuck out of here. \nANNIE Don't talk to me like that. \nPAUL (staring at her now) Why, what are you going to do? (spreading his arms wide) Kill me? Take your best shot. \nANNIE (taken aback) Why are you so mean, Mister you'd-be- dead-in-the-snow-if-it-wasn't-for- me? \nPAUL Oh, no reason, you keep me prisoner, you make me burn my book, you drive a sledgehammer into my ankles... \nANNIE I'll drive a sledgehammer into your man-gland if you're not nicer-- \nPAUL (He spreads his legs) Be my guest. \nANNIE (after a beat) That's disgusting. \nAs she exits. \nCUT TO: \nA ROAD. Empty. Hold for a moment--now a car appears around a curve. \nCUT TO: \nTHE CAR. BUSTER is driving fast. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL in his room. He sits as before, by the window. He doesn't move. Now he closes his eyes, stretches, sighs as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE KITCHEN \nANNIE, busily making cocoa. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER IN HIS CAR. He stops at a mailbox. The name on the box is WILKES. Buster turns his car slowly into the driveway by the mailbox. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL. He yawns, opens his eyes briefly. Closes them. In the distance now, growing more and more visible is Buster's car-- \n--and now PAUL'S EYES go open wide, and he's staring out the window at the car as it keeps on coming, closer, closer and \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER, looking around. He's driving very slowly, carefully. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL. Fixating on the window and now it's all going to be all right, everything's going to be all right-- \n--and then ANNIE is on him, hypodermic needle in hand, jabbing it into his arm. He desperately tries to fight her off, but the drug starts to take hold. He tries to grab her by the neck, but she fights him off as she wheels him out of the room, down the hall and towards the cellar door. \nANNIE I don't think I'll ever understand you. I cook your meals, I tend to you practically twenty-four hours a day, and you continue to fight me. When are we going to develop a sense of trust? \nANNIE opens the cellar door. PAUL is all but limp by now. As she picks him up and starts to carry him down the steps-- \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER pulling up in front of the house. As he gets out of his car-- \nCUT TO: \nANNIE placing Paul on the cellar floor and heading up the stairs. PAUL is out. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER heading up the steps to the front door. \nCUT TO: \nAs she exits into the kitchen. \nANNIE There's some already made. \nBUSTER lingers in Paul's room for a beat, then goes into the hallway. \nBUSTER Must get lonely, living out here all by yourself. \nANNIE I always say if you can't enjoy your own company, you're not fit company for anyone else. \nBUSTER You got a point there... \nAs Buster moves up the stairs-- \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, still fighting the drug. His arm twitches almost involuntarily, grazing the barbecue. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER opening the door to Annie's room. He looks around and just as he is about to turn to leave-- \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, standing right in front of him. \nANNIE Here you are. \nBUSTER heads down the stairs, ANNIE follows. \nBUSTER Thanks, Miz Wilkes, but I don't want to take up any more of your time. I best be going. \nANNIE But you didn't even taste your cocoa. \nThey cross to the front door. \nBUSTER I'm sure it's wonderful, but really should be getting back. \nBUSTER opens the door. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL stirring. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER and ANNIE at the door. \nBUSTER If you don't mind, perhaps I could pay you another visit sometime. \nANNIE I'd be delighted. Now that you know the way... \nWith that, she closes the door. We stay with BUSTER. He stands on the front porch for a beat, thinking, then starts heading down the porch steps. Just as he reaches about halfway down, we HEAR A LOUD CRASH coming from inside the house. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL--he has managed to partially fight his way through the drug, and in waking has accidentally knocked over the barbecue. He fights to clear the cobwebs. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER Miz Wilkes, are you all right? \nThere is no answer. He quietly moves into the house. \nBUSTER Miz Wilkes? \nAgain, no answer. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, still fighting to gain complete consciousness. \nPAUL (weakly) Here. I'm down here. Down here. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER. Hearing Paul's muffled call for help, he tracks the sound to the cellar door. As PAUL continues to call out, Buster looks around, sees no one, and opens the cellar door. The shaft of light from the open door pours down on Paul, who is still lying on the floor. \nBUSTER Mr. Sheldon? \nBut before Paul can answer, there's the sound of a LOUD EXPLOSION. Seemingly from nowhere a hole is ripped through Buster's chest, knocking him out of frame, revealing Annie, smoking shotgun in hand, standing at the top of the cellar steps. \nANNIE Don't feel bad, Paul. It had to happen. I've been waiting for this sign. \nANNIE walks toward BUSTER'S BODY and very casually takes his gun out of its holster. \nANNIE I've known for some time why I was chosen to save you. You and I were meant to be together forever. But now our time in this world must end. But don't worry, Paul. I've already prepared for what must be done. I put two bullets in my gun, one for you and one for me. Oh, darling, it will be so beautiful. \nWith that, ANNIE turns and exits the cellar. \nPAUL You'll know very soon. I'm starting the last chapter. And when I finish, I want everything to be perfect. I'll require three things. \nANNIE What things? \nPAUL You don't know? \nANNIE (smiling) I was fooling, silly. (ticking them off) You need a cigarette, because you used to smoke but you quit except when you finish a book, and you just have one, and the match is to light it. And you need one glass of champagne. (thinks) Dome Pear-igg-non. \nPAUL Dome Pear-igg-non it is. \nAS ANNIE exits. \nCUT TO: \nTHE WINDOW \nThe first light of morning is starting to break through. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, stretching. He makes sure everything is set. \nPAUL (calling out) Annie! Annie! \nWith that, she enters. \nANNIE Yes, Paul. \nPAUL I'm almost done. \nANNIE Oh, Paul, this is so romantic. Ian and Windthorne dueling for the right to Misery's hand. Does Ian win? Oh, don't me. It's Windthorne, right? \nPAUL You'll know everything in a minute. Get the champagne. \nANNIE (dying from the suspense) Ahh!!! \nShe exits; PAUL adjusts the manuscript on the table and then types the last line. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE IN THE KITCHEN. She takes the bottle of Dom Perignon out of the icebox, places it on a tray with two glasses-- opens a drawer--takes out the gun--places it in her pocket-- then takes out the hypodermic needle and places it on the tray. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM \nANNIE enters with the tray. She sets it down on the table. \nANNIE Did I do good? \nPAUL You did perfect. Except for one thing. This time we need two glasses. \nHe takes the last page out of the typewriter. \nANNIE Oh, Paul. \nAs soon as she exits, PAUL drops the manuscript to the floor, pulls the lighter fluid from his pants, and starts dousing the manuscript with lighter fluid. He grabs the last chapter and twists the last few pages together torch style. He douses it with the fluid and holds the match out of sight. \nHe smiles as we \nCUT TO: \nANNIE entering with the second glass... \nPAUL It's all right here, Annie. Remember how for all those years no one ever knew who Misery's real father was, or if they'd ever be reunited? It's all right here. Will Misery finally lead her countrymen to freedom? Does she finally marry Ian or will it be Windthorne? It's all right here. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MATCH, as he strikes it and \nCUT TO: \nANNIE screaming-- \nANNIE Paul, you can't. \nAnd as her hands fly out beseechingly-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE CHAMPAGNE BOTTLE--it falls to the floor, explodes like a torpedo, shards of glass all over, curds of foam everywhere-- \nPAUL Why not? I learned it from you... \nAnd on that-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE LAST CHAPTER as Paul brings the match close to it and it bursts into flame. And Paul, holding it like the torch it is. Annie starts moving forward now. \nANNIE, the stronger, relentless, moving up on him, and \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, his grip broken as he turns and \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, all-powerful, looming over him and \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, hitting up at her and \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, swelling, and the blood pours down and if she feels his blows she doesn't show it and \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, whatever energy he has left he uses now, trying to twist and strike and as his body moves-- \nCUT TO: \nMETAL BASED FLOOR LAMP and \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, grabbing the thing, suddenly bringing it across his body, clobbering Annie in the face and \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, startled by the power of the blow and for a moment she is stopped and \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, as with everything he has left, he crunches her forehead with the sharp heavy metal base, just creams her as the air is forced out of her-- \nCUT TO: \nANNIE. Her eyes roll up into her head. For a moment all we see are the whites-- \n--then she collapses on PAUL, a motionless mountain of slack flesh. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, scrambling free, pushing her off him, crawling for the door-- \nCUT TO: \n--outside the door, as PAUL crawls into view, makes it to the corridor, reaches back, closes the door, locks it. \nSafe, he collapses, exhausted against the wall opposite the door. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPAUL. HOURS LATER. It is dawn. He is awakened by a loud smashing at the front door. After a couple of heart-stopping pounds, \nCUT TO: \nTHE FRONT DOOR smashes open, revealing two cops with guns drawn. \nTHE POLICEMEN, hurrying to PAUL. The YOUNGER COP kneels beside Paul. \nYOUNGER COP It's the writer--the dead one-- \nPAUL (trying to keep himself together) --right! I'm the dead one-- \nOLDER COP Where's Sheriff McCain? \nPAUL He's in the cellar. She killed him. \nOLDER COP Annie Wilkes? \nPAUL Yeah. She's in there. \nCUT TO: \nThe OLDER COP, taking the key to the room, unlocks the door, throws it open, and as he steps inside-- \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE BEDROOM \nThe OLDER COP has his gun ready to fire, but even with it tight in his hand, he's edgy as hell. \nHe looks around-- \n--glass and bloodstains on the floor. The charred remains of a manuscript. \n", "test1_input": "CUT TO: \nTHE AREA WHERE THE WRECK IS--AS SEEN FROM THE ROAD. The car is barely visible as the snow begins to cover it. \nCUT TO: \nTHE WRECK from outside, and we're close to it now, with the snow coming down ever harder--already bits of the car are covered in white. \nCAMERA MOVES IN TO \nPAUL. He's inside and doing his best to fight is, but his consciousness is going. He tries to keep his eyes open but they're slits. \nSlowly, he manages to reach out with his left arm for his briefcase-- \n--and he clutches it to his battered body. The MUSIC continues on. \nBut PAUL is far from listening. His eyes flutter, flutter again. Now they're starting to close. \nThe man is dying. \nMotionless, he still clutches the battered briefcase. \nHOLD ON THE CASE. Then-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nThe BRIEFCASE in Paul's hands as he sits at a desk. \nSINDELL (O.S.) What's that? \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nWe are in New York City in the office of Paul's literary agent, MARCIA SINDELL. The walls of the large room are absolutely crammed with book and movie posters, in English and all other kinds of other languages, all of them featuring the character of MISERY CHASTAIN, a perfectly beautiful woman. Misery's Challenge, Misery's Triumph--eight of them. All written by Paul Sheldon. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, lifting up the battered briefcase--maybe when new it cost two bucks, but he treats it like gold. \nPAUL An old friend. I was rummaging through a closet and it was just sitting there. Like it was waiting for me. \nCUT TO: \nSINDELL (searching for a compliment) It's... it's nice, Paul. It's got... character. \nCUT TO: \nTHE TWO OF THEM \nPAUL When I wrote my first book, I used to carry it around in this while I was looking for a publisher. That was a good book, Marcia. I was a writer then. \nSINDELL You're still a writer. \nPAUL I haven't been a writer since I got into the Misery business-- \nSINDELL (holding up the cover art of MISERY'S CHILD) Not a bad business. This thing would still be growing, too. The first printing order on Misery's Child was the most ever--over a million. \nPAUL Marcia, please. \nSINDELL No, no. Misery Chastain put braces on your daughter's teeth and is putting her through college, bought you two houses and floor seats to the Knick games and what thanks does she get? You go and kill her. \nPAUL Marcia, you know I started \"Misery\" on a lark. Do I look like a guy who writes romance novels? Do I sound like Danielle Steel? It was a one- time shot and we got lucky. I never meant it to become my life. And if I hadn't gotten rid of her now, I'd have ended up writing her forever. (touches his briefcase) For the first time in fifteen years, I think I'm really onto something here. \nSINDELL I'm glad to hear that, Paul, I really am. But you have to know--when your fans find out that you killed off their favorite heroine, they're not going to say, \"Ooh, good, Paul Sheldon can finally write what we've always wanted: An esoteric, semi- autobiographical character study. \nPAUL (passionately) Marcia, why are you doing this to me? Don't you know I'm scared enough? Don't you think I remember how nobody gave a shit about my first books? You think I'm dying to go back to shouting in the wilderness? (beat) I'm doing this because I have to. (Marcia is stopped) Now, I'm leaving for Colorado to try to finish this and I want your good thoughts--because if I can make it work ... (beat) I might just have something that I want on my tombstone. \nOn the word \"tombstone\" \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S TOMBSTONE--the upside down car with the blizzard coming gale-force and his motionless body trapped inside the car. \nThe WIND screams. PAUL'S EYES flutter, then close. \nHold \nKeep holding as-- \nSuddenly there's a new sound as a crowbar SCRATCHES at the door-- \n-- nd now the door is ripped open as we \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nA BUNDLED-UP FIGURE gently beginning to pull PAUL and the case from the car. For a moment, it's hard to tell if it's a man or woman-- \n--not to let the cat out of the bag or anything, but it is, very much, a woman. Her name is ANNIE WILKES and she is close to Paul's age. She is in many ways a remarkable creature. Strong, self-sufficient, passionate in her likes and dislikes, loves and hates. \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nPAUL AND ANNIE: CLOSE UP. She slowly brings her mouth down close to his. Then their lips touch as she forces air inside him. \nANNIE (Their lips touch again. Then--) You hear me--Breathe! I said breathe!!! \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, as he starts to breathe-- \n--in a moment his eyes suddenly open wide, but he's in shock, the eyes see nothing-- \nCUT TO: \nANNIE--the moment she sees him come to life, she goes into action, lifting PAUL in a fireman's carry, starting the difficult climb back up the steep hill. \nAs she moves away, she and Paul are obliterated by the white falling snow. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE WHITE OF WHAT SEEMS LIKE A HOSPITAL. Everything is bled of color. It's all vague-- \n--we are looking at this from Paul's blurred vision. \nAnd throughout this next sequence, there are these SOUNDS, words really, but they make no sense. \n\"...no... worry... \n...be... fine... \n...good care... you... \n...I'm your number one fan...\" \nThe first thing we see during this is something all white. It takes a moment before we realize it's a ceiling. \nNow, a white wall. \nAn I.V. bottle is next, the medicine dripping down a tube into PAUL'S LEFT ARM. The other arm is bandaged and in a sling. \nANNIE is standing beside the bed. She wears off-white and seems very much like a nurse. A good nurse. She has pills in her hands. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL. Motionless, dead pale. He has a little beard now. Eyes barely open, he's shaking with fever. \nPAUL (hardly able to whisper) ...where... am I...? \nANNIE is quickly by his side. \nANNIE (so gently) Shhh... we're just outside Silver Creek. \nPAUL How long...? \nANNIE You've been here two days. You're gonna be okay. (relieved) My name is Annie Wilkes and I'm-- \nPAUL --my number one fan. \nAnd now the gibberish words make sense. \nANNIE That's right. I'm also a nurse. Here. (Now, as she brings the pills close) Take these. \nShe helps him to swallow, as Paul's eyes close. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nAN EXTERIOR OF THE PLACE. It's a farmhouse--we 're in a desolate area with mountains in the background. \nTHE HOUSE is set on a knoll so that Paul's room, although on the first floor, is ten feet off the ground. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, in the room. He's not on the I.V. anymore. His fever has broken. Annie enters, pills in her hand. \nANNIE Here. \nPAUL What are they...? \nANNIE They're called Novril--they're for your pain. (helps him take them) \nANNIE applies a cool rag to his forehead. \nPAUL Shouldn't I be in a hospital? \nANNIE The  blizzard was too strong. I couldn't risk trying to get you there. I tried calling, but the phone lines are down. \nPAUL tries to test his left arm. \n", "test2_input": "CUT TO: \nTHE CAR. Suddenly, it goes into a little icy spin--she fights it back under control. \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE THE CAR \nBUSTER (suddenly) Stop--stop right here. \nVIRGINIA What? What is it? \nCUT TO: \nTHE CAR, skidding, slowing, stopping. BOTH OF THEM get out, go to the edge of the road. Mountains of snow. Nothing much else visible. Then Buster points. \nBUSTER Look at that broken branch there... \nCUT TO: \nVIRGINIA, seeing it, unconvinced. \nVIRGINIA Could be the weight of the snow. \nBUSTER Could be--or a rotten branch or a mountain lion could have landed on it. Could be a lot of things. \nHe steps off the road, starts down. \nCUT TO: \nVIRGINIA, watching him, worried--it's very slippery. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER, graceful, in great shape, navigating down easily. \nCUT TO: \nTHE TREE that the car ran into. BUSTER reaches it, studies it. \nCUT TO: \nVIRGINIA, staring out after him--she can't see him because the drop is both too steep and covered with trees and mounds of snow. \nVIRGINIA Anything down there? \nBUSTER'S VOICE (O.S.) Yeah. An enormous amount of snow. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER. He's moved away from the tree now, going toward where the Mustang is buried. \nCUT TO: \nTHE MOUND OF SNOW with the Mustang inside. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER, making his way closer to it, closer, staring around. \nCUT TO: \nTHE AREA. Nothing to be seen--everything is covered with mountains of snow. You could have a house down there and not be able to see it. Just glaring white. \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER, angry, frustrated, turning around and around and \nCUT TO: \nBUSTER from another angle, from behind the mound with the Mustang inside--and out of his sight, glistening in the sun, a bit of the door protrudes. But, of course, Buster can't see it. \nHOLD ON BUSTER, in a sour mood, staring around as the edge of the door continues to glisten. \nCUT TO: \nVIRGINIA, on the road as Buster makes his way back up, still ticked. \nVIRGINIA (they move to the car) You really think Sheldon's out there? \nBUSTER Hope not--if he is, he's dead. Let's go to the newspaper office. \nAs they get in the car-- \nANOTHER CAR DRIVING BY--it's Annie in her Jeep--neither she nor Buster notice each other. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM \n", "test2_true": "ANNIE Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you. \nPAUL It's fine. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL \nPaul's eyes fluttering awake to see the hardback copy of his novel, Misery's Child, in Annie's hands. She's never been more excited-- \nANNIE They had it at the store, Paul, there was a whole batch of them there. As soon as I saw it, I slammed my money down. I got the first copy. \nPAUL Then the roads are open... \nANNIE The one to town is, but that's about it. I called the hospital and talked to the head orthopedic surgeon. I told him who you were and what had happened. He said as long as there's no infection, you're not in any danger, and as soon as the road to the hospital is open, they'll send an ambulance for you. \nPAUL The phones are working? \nANNIE Well, mine's still out. But the ones in town were working just fine. I called that agent of yours. (soft now) Oh, Paul, I peeked at the very beginning. (looks at him) What a wonderful first page--just to read the name Misery Chastain... \nPAUL My daughter must be going nuts. \nANNIE ...it's like a visit from my oldest, dearest friend. \nPAUL I was supposed to be home for her birthday three days ago. \nANNIE Your agent said she would tell her you were okay. But I'm afraid you'll have to wait until tomorrow if you want to speak to her yourself. \nShe starts to leave, stops at the door. \nANNIE (She looks at him now with almost a look of amazement) Oh, Paul, what a poet you are... \nAs she leaves-- \nDISSOLVE TO: \nPAUL, watching as she enters, moves to him, carrying a tray. \nANNIE I made you my speciality--scrambled eggs a la Wilkes. And I'm on page \nPAUL I guess that means it's okay. \nANNIE No. No, it isn't, it's-- (halts) --oh pooh, I can't think of any words. Would \"great\" be insulting? \nPAUL I can live with \"great.\" \nHe starts, with effort, to eat. \nANNIE (as she turns, goes) No, it's not just great, it's perfect, a perfect, perfect thing. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL'S ROOM. MID-AFTERNOON \nANNIE is clearing Paul's tray. She hands him his Novril; he quickly swallows them. \nANNIE I'm up to page 185. I always get sad when I pass the halfway point. Will you do me a favor? I'd love it if you would autograph my copy. I already have your autograph on a picture, but it would mean so much to me to get it in person. I know you're right- handed, so don't worry if it's not so legible. I'll cherish it anyway. \nAs PAUL signs the book: \nANNIE I don't mean to pry, but I've read in two magazines now where you were seeing this model who does those disgusting jeans commercials. And I said it can't be true. Paul Sheldon would never waste his time with a trampy woman like that. \nPAUL Well, you can't believe everything you read in magazines. \nANNIE I knew it. I knew it wasn't true. Boy, how do they get away with printing stuff like that? \nPAUL You'd be amazed at what some people will believe. \nHe finishes the autograph, hands the book back to her. \nANNIE Thank you so much. \nPAUL My pleasure. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE WINDOW - LATE - AFTERNOON SUNLIGHT \nCUT TO: \nTHE DOOR. IT opens and guess what--a sow lumbers in. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, kind of stunned as this female pig skitters its way around the room, excited, confused, slipping and sliding. \nCUT TO: \nANNIE, all smiles and happiness, laughing in the doorway. \n", "test3_input": "ANNIE (looking at it) Well, it does smudge after all--isn't that fascinating? \nPAUL I thought you'd be interested. I'd like you to be in on everything, Annie. Not just the finished book, but how it's written. \nANNIE Thank you for thinking of me. (She can be so charming when she wants) Anything else I can get while I'm in town? Any other crucial requirements that need satisfying? Would you like a tiny tape recorder? Or maybe a handmade set of writing slippers? \nPAUL No, just the paper will be fine. \nANNIE (suddenly very agitated) Are you sure? 'Cause if you want, I'll bring back the whole store for you. \nPAUL Annie, what's the matter? \nANNIE What's the matter? I'll tell you what's the matter. I go out of my way for you. I do everything to try and make you happy. I feed you, I clean you, I dress you. And what thanks do I get? \"You bought the wrong paper, Annie. I can't write on this paper, Annie.\" Well, I'll get your stupid paper, but you just better start showing me a little more appreciation around here, Mister Man. \nWith that, she throws the ream of paper in PAUL'S LAP, causing considerable pain. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DOOR as she slams it shut, locks it, stomps off and \nCUT TO: \nTHE WINDOW. Annie, in a parka, can be seen storming out in the direction where her Cherokee was parked. She gets in and drives off. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL. He heaves a sigh, reaches out toward his tortured knees, then drops his head. He sees something. \nCUT TO: \nBOBBY PIN on the floor. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, as he moves toward the bobby pin. Or tries to. It's brutally hard for him. The chair moves half a foot. Stops. Paul strains again. Another half foot. Another. \nCUT TO: \nThe BOBBY PIN. The wheelchair is beside it now. PAUL reaches down for it. Can't make it. Tries again. Can't. He takes a deep breath, forces himself to bend, ignoring the pain. The bobby pin is in his hands. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, inserting the bobby pin into the keyhole, beginning to jimmy the lock. \nCUT TO: \nTHE LOCK--it makes a SOUND--something has caught. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, excited, trying to force the bobby pin and he's doing great--until it slips from his hands, falls to the floor again. \nPAUL (furious) Shit... \nCUT TO: \nTHE BOBBY PIN. Paul reaches for it. The pain has him. He reaches again, involuntarily cries out. But he grabs it, clutches it tight. \nCUT TO: \nTHE KEYHOLE. Paul is trying to jimmy the lock a second time. \nNo luck. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL. In wild frustration. \nPAUL You've written how to do this--now do it! \nCUT TO: \nTHE KEYHOLE. There is a loud CLICKING sound. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DOOR as Paul turns the knob. The door opens a crack. \nPAUL (amazed) What do you know, it actually works. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, trying to get out of the room--but it's a bitch because in order to get to the lock he had to move the wheelchair up to the door and in order to get out, he's got to maneuver it out of the way of the door and every turn of the chair's wheels is an effort for him. He works at it and works at it, but his energy is failing him. He's pale, perspiring. Finally he succeeds, barely forces his way into the hall. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, in the hallway outside. He looks around for a phone. Doesn't see one. He wheels himself over to the front door, tries it. It's locked from the outside. \nPAUL What a surprise. \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO: \nTHE TELEPHONE \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, wheeling into the living room. Dark red predominates. It's a musty room. Over the mantel, a photograph of a six- year-old ANNIE, with her mother and father in front of the family car--a new 1952 Buick. These were happier times. \nThe windows have bars on them. \nAs PAUL begins to wheel as fast as he can toward the phone-- \nCUT TO: \nTHE PHONE as PAUL at last grabs for it, gets it, punches the \"operator\" button-- \nPAUL Operator... (nothing) ...OPERATOR... (wildly frustrated) ...Shit! \nHe shakes the phone. It's terribly light. He picks it up, turns it over--it's hollow, just a shell of a telephone. He stares at it for a long moment, shaking his head, the disappointment plain. \nPAUL You crazy bitch... \nHe puts the phone back on the table. \nCUT TO: \nTHE GENERAL STORE. DAY. \nAnnie exits the store, carrying new paper, hops into her Cherokee and drives off. \nCUT TO: \nTHE STUDY, as PAUL enters. He looks around. \nIt's stuffed with heavy, graceless furniture as well as lots of coffee tables covered with knickknacks. As he, with effort, wheels across it-- \nCUT TO: \nA shelf of BOOKS. PAUL SHELDON books. EVERY Paul Sheldon book. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, pausing, looking at her collection. The only book on the shelf that isn't his is a large scrapbook. The title on the back reads \"My Life.\" \nHe glances back at the shelf as he forces his wheelchair across the study, and we \nCUT TO: \nA SMALL TABLE with little ceramic doodads on top. The wheelchair his it, one of the doodads topples--it's a penguin, fragile looking, and as it's about to fall to the floor and shatter-- \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, grabbing for it, catching it, putting it back where it was. He continues his slow way across the room and \nCUT TO: \nTHE HALLWAY. \nOut in the hallway, on his way toward the kitchen, PAUL notices a door to his right. He wheels over and surprisingly it opens. However, this is not a door to the outside of the house, only a storage pantry. He looks around--nothing but canned goods, potato chips, cereals and large plastic Coke containers, etc. Just as he is about to close the door, he notices an open cardboard box. He opens the flap and sees all kinds of prescription drugs. Among them are a couple of strips of Novril encapsulated in blisters. He grabs them and stuffs them into his sweatpants. Now he closes the pantry door and heads to the kitchen. \nCUT TO: \nTHE KITCHEN \nAs PAUL approaches it. He starts to wheel his way in, but he has trouble. \nHe backs up slightly, wheels forward again-- \n--but the door is too narrow for the chair to fit through. He pounds his fists on the chair arm, staring as we \nCUT TO: \nTHE BACK DOOR. It's at the far end of the kitchen leading to the outside. It seems somehow less formidable than the front door did. The windows around the kitchen are barred. \nCUT TO: \nPAUL, staring at the kitchen door-- \n--then without warning, he makes his move, starting to lower himself out of the chair \ngently to the floor-- \n--only it doesn't work that way. It's too awkward, he doesn't have the strength to maneuver properly-- \n--and his body tilts awkwardly out of the chair, slams hard against the hard floor. \nCUT TO: \n"}

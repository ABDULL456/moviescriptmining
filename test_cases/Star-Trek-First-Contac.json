{"train": "Star Trek: First Contact \nStory by Rick Berman & Brannon Braga & Ronald D. Moore \nScreenplay by Brannon Braga & Ronald D. Moore \nFirst Draft \nSeptember 29, 1995 \n1   A BLACK VOID                                                 1 \nWe can hear movement. Strange skittering sounds, like razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses... the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an eerie, alien cacophony. \n2   EARTH                                                        2 \nappears, hanging now in the starry blackness. The alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion. Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth, and we REVEAL we are in -- \n3   INT. BORG RECON CENTER                                       3 \nThe image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall. We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre -- a mixture of organic and mechanical elements. Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises. Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera, vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is. \nAll of the monitors are active, and they present myriad IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The screens show everything from written Chinese... to Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of space battles from the 24th century. The entire range of human history dancing across the monitors. The effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever is watching this is studying the human race. \nThere is another THUMP and the wall of monitors SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of voices speaking at once : \nBORG Restrict search parameters to 1-9- 9-8 through 2-0-8-4. \nThe images on the monitors now change to show us images from 21ST CENTURY Earth history. \nAgain, it's a collection of still photography, video footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound- bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of enticing details. As the images race across the monitors, we should learn the following. \n-- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos. Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations. Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation. \n-- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions, environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The United States ceases to exist. All political authority vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second Dark Age. \n-- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history. \n-- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the human race. \n-- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an alien civilization brings the planet together as never before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning to solve long-standing problems with new technology. We see an early replicator producing food for the starving millions. A new World Government is formed. \n-- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet. \n-- These are images recounting the birth of the Star Trek universe. \nAnother muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic inflection, speaks for the first time: \nWOMAN'S VOICE Stop search. Calculate temporal coordinates. J-Fourteen. \nAnother explosion ROCKS the room and it takes us to: \n4   EXT. SPACE - A BORG SPHERE                                   4 \nA huge, spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser shot from an unseen vessel. The BLAST smashes into the Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues. The Sphere returns FIRE. FOLLOW the Borg fire to -- \n5   A FEDERATION STARSHIP                                        5 \nlocked in battle with the Borg Sphere. The Borg fire DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast. \n6   NEW ANGLE                                                    6 \nas the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this is just one small part of -- \n7   A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE                                       7 \ninvolving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see. Ships turning, twisting, firing, exploding. Lots of movement. It's a spectacular sight. \nThe Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading off in another direction. \n8   NEW ANGLE                                                    8 \nIn the middle of the battle. A BORG CUBE is attacking a smaller Federation starship. The starship is taking quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it doesn't look like it can take much  more of this. \nSuddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in from O.C. The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship, causing massive damage. \n9   THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E                                9 \nSOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered starship. \nThe Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful vessel. An elegant and majestic ship. But unlike the last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons and other defensive armory. We get the feeling this Enterprise is ready for anything. \n10   INT. ENTERPRISE-E - BRIDGE                                  10 \nThe Bridge has been redesigned. A single Captain's chair dominates the room, and surrounding consoles and stations all face inward instead of out, giving Picard instant access to his officers. PICARD in the Captain's chair. RIKER at a new Ops station. DATA at the helm. WORF at Tactical. TROI at Communications, various CREWMEMBERS at their posts. The ship is at Red Alert and everyone is tense. \nA QUANTUM TORPEDO BLASTS out of the launcher and heads toward the Borg cube. This torpedo is completely different than the traditional photon torpedo. It oscillates and changes shape and color as it streaks toward the Borg ship. \n20   THE BORG SHIP                                               20 \nas the quantum torpedo HITS IT. But instead of exploding on the surface, the torpedo PIERCES the ship like an armor-piercing shell and momentarily VANISHES from view. The ship then EXPLODES like a star going supernova -- bright light and shock waves. \n21   INT. BRIDGE                                                 21 \nThe ship is ROCKED violently by the shock wave. People hanging on. \nDATA Main power still on-line, Captain. \nRiker looks at his console. \nRIKER Casualties are light, Captain. Minor buckling on the port nacelle. Nothing serious. \nWORF Incoming message from the Starship Intrepid. Admiral Hayes. \nPICARD On screen. \nThe viewer shows ADMIRAL HAYES on the Bridge of his starship. \nADMIRAL HAYES The new quantum torpedoes are doing the trick, Jean-Luc. We've destroyed forty-seven Borg ships so far... and only lost fifteen of our own. (beat) But one of the Borg ships has broken through our defenses, and it's heading directly for Earth. Can you handle it? \nPICARD Absolutely. \nADMIRAL HAYES Good hunting. Hayes out. \nPICARD Mister Data, set a pursuit course. Maximum warp. \n22   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                 22 \nas it breaks away from the battle...and races INTO WARP. \n23   EXT. SPACE - EARTH                                          23 \nThere are Starfleet satellites and space stations in close orbit. The Borg Sphere seen before enters frame. The satellites open fire, but they have little effect on the massive Borg Sphere, which returns fire, EXPLODING them in orbit. \nThe Sphere heads down toward the Earth... \n24   INT. BRIDGE                                                 24 \nDATA We are approaching the Terran System, Captain. \nPICARD Go to impulse. Where's the Borg ship? \nDATA It has entered Earth orbit. (off console) Correction -- it is not in orbit. It is heading directly toward the surface. \nPICARD What? \nPicard gets up, moves to Data's console. \nRIKER (incredulous) Some sort of suicide tactic? \nDATA Unknown, sir. Suicide tactics are not normally associated with the Borg. \nData reacts to his console. \nDATA Sensors show a temporal signature emanating from the Sphere. High concentrations of tachyons... \nPicard studies Data's monitor. \nPICARD And chronometric particles... it's as though they're trying to create a temporal vortex... \nA beat as Picard makes a shocking realization. \nPICARD Time travel... they're attempting time travel... (beat) Full power, Mister Data. Worf, quantum torpedoes at my command! \nWORF Aye, sir. \n25   EXT. EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE                                     25 \nThe Borg Sphere GLOWING RED and beginning to burn with friction as it PLUMMETS toward Earth... \n26   NEW ANGLE - THE ENTERPRISE                                  26 \nplunging down into the atmosphere, giving chase... \n27   INT. BRIDGE                                                 27 \nUrgent. \nWORF Range -- fifty kilometers. \nDATA A temporal vortex is forming directly ahead of the Sphere. \nThe Enterprise is being chased by FIVE BORG SHIPS as it heads down toward the planet. The Borg vessels FIRE on the Enterprise. \n34   INT. BRIDGE                                                 34 \nAs before. The ship is shaking. \nWORF Hull integrity down to thirty percent... \nPICARD Steady as she goes. \n35   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN (OPTICAL)                                35 \nAhead of the ship, we see the VORTEX collapsing. The shaking increases. A console EXPLODES. \nWORF Borg vessels are closing to two thousand meters. \nThe ship is HIT AGAIN AND AGAIN. On the View Screen, we're nearly on the vortex, but it's closing fast. \nPICARD Take us in! \n36   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE & VORTEX (OPTICAL)                  36 \nThe Enterprise just barely makes it inside the vortex as it finally COLLAPSES. Both the Enterprise and the vortex VANISH. \nCUT TO: \n37   EXT. SPACE                                                  37 \nAn empty star field. Suddenly, the VORTEX APPEARS and the Enterprise comes ROARING out into space. The vortex VANISHES behind the ship. \n38   INT. BRIDGE                                                 38 \nThe shaking subsides. Everyone exchanges a look, tries to re-orient themselves. \nPICARD Report. \nRIKER We're still in Earth orbit. \nPICARD On screen. \n39   INCLUDE VIEWSCREEN                                          39 \nWhich shows Earth. The Borg pollution is gone. \nPICARD What year is it? \nDATA (working) According to our astrometric readings... the year is 2063. \nWORF Captain, I've found the Borg Sphere. It's on the far side of the planet...firing at the surface. \nPICARD (to Data) Intercept course, full impulse. (to Worf) Weapons status? \nWORF Phasers are off-line... we have two quantum torpedoes left. But the computer targeting system has been destroyed. \nPICARD Go to manual. \nWorf pops open a panel and a high-tech TARGETING console emerges with a small MONITOR and a traditional CROSS- HAIR in the center. Worf grabs the targeting hand- controls -- futuristic joysticks. \n40   EXT. SPACE - THE BORG SPHERE                                40 \nThe ship is FIRING its weapons down toward the planet as the Enterprise comes up over the horizon. \n41   INT. BRIDGE                                                 41 \nAs before. Worf works his controls. A complex array of grids, coordinate information, speed data, and other weapons info on the monitor screen. He begins trying to focus the cross-hairs on the Sphere. \nPICARD (over above action, to Troi) Track their weapons fire. \nTROI (off console) Western hemisphere... North American continent... \nDATA We are within torpedo range. \nRIKER They've seen us. They're taking evasive action. \nPICARD (urgent) Mister Worf? \nWorf struggles with the targeting system. \nWORF Target... \nThe crosshairs keep missing the image of the Borg Sphere, which is now twisting and turning to evade us. Troi reacts to her console. \nTROI Captain, they're firing at a nuclear missile silo... in central Montana. \nWORF (struggling) Target... \nBEVERLY Cochrane... the inventor of warp drive? \nPICARD Yes... \nBEVERLY But he's been dead for three hundred... (realizes, long sigh) Oh God... we've gone back in time again, haven't we? \nPICARD I'm afraid so. If the Borg succeed in preventing First Contact with the Vulcans... Earth will remain in the Second Dark Age... an easy target when the Borg arrive in the 24th century. \nBEVERLY Well, why didn't you just say so in the first place? \nPicard gives her a look. As they keep walking... \nCUT TO: \n46   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                 46 \nhanging in orbit of Earth. \n47   INT. ENGINEERING                                            47 \nCLOSE ON A DEAD CREWMEMBER lying on her back. A sheet is covering her face. A hand reaches in, pulls back the sheet, revealing the face of a crewman. \nTROI Lieutenant Sandra Farrel. \nWIDEN to REVEAL Troi and Data. Data is holding back the sheet while Troi scans the body with a tricorder. There is repair work going on in the b.g. Two medical N.D.s stand by. \nTROI It appears death was caused by a plasma discharge. (beat) I'll note in her record that she never left her post. \nTroi glances at Data, who is clearly disturbed by the sight of the dead woman, holding his EMOTIONS in check with difficulty. \nTROI Did you know her? \nDATA Not very well. We met shortly after the Enterprise-E was commissioned. I found her to be a most... promising officer. \nTroi looks at him in concern. \nTROI Data... are you sure you're all right? \nDATA I am still having difficulty integrating certain emotions into my programming. Grief, loss, remorse... \nTROI We still have to make reports on ten more crewmen killed in action. Maybe you should deactivate your emotion chip until we're done. \nData considers. \nDATA No. Human beings do not have that luxury, and neither should I. \nTROI I will admit... there are times when I wish I had an emotion chip I could turn on and off. \nRIKER'S COM VOICE Riker to Data. \nDATA (taps combadge) Go ahead, Commander. \nINTERCUT: \n48   INT. BRIDGE                                                 48 \nRiker, Worf, N.D.s at their stations. \nRIKER We're reading some kind of gas leak in the Environmental Control Room. Take a repair team down and check it out. \nDATA On my way, Commander. \nAs Data EXITS... \n49   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                 49 \nA WIDE SHOT of the ship. CAMERA CLOSES ON the AFT SECTION of the ship, moving underneath of the hull, pushing in on an area at the very bottom of the Enterprise. \n50   INT. ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL                                   50 \nData and ENSIGN PORTER ENTER through a set of doors. The lights are off in the room, dim. This is a large room crammed with many conduits, gas tanks, 24th century machinery and monitors. It's normally unmanned -- this is where oxygen, gravity, heat, and other environmental conditions of the ship are controlled. In a far corner of the room a CONDUIT leading to a series of high-pressure TANKS labeled \"D-O2\" has ruptured and is SPEWING a corrosive, poisonous GAS. \nData scans it with his tricorder. \nDATA (to Porter) One of the diathermic oxygen tanks has been damaged. \nPORTER (shocked) Diathermic oxygen? \nDATA It is a new subsystem of Nova Class ships. It regulates hydropressure and temperature variance. (beat) Remain here. The gas is highly corrosive to organic material. It would liquefy your flesh on contact. \nPORTER Be my guest, sir. \nData walks over to the spewing gas tank, and without concern shoves both hands into the corrosive gas... \n... groping around for the broken conduit, finally grabs hold of it... and with android strength BENDS the metal conduit back into the bulkhead. The gas stops leaking. Data is completely unaffected by the corrosive gas. \nPICARD (to others) See if any of these men are Cochrane. \nGeordi and the Guards start checking the dead bodies. \nGEORDI Mitchell... DePaul... \nLANGE This one's a woman... named Kirby. \nPicard and Beverly move toward the immense blast door. As Beverly scans it, Picard glances at a nearby desk... \n57   THE DESK                                                    57 \nis littered with debris and various documents and schematics. THREE PHOTOGRAPHS are pinned to a bulletin board above the desk -- they show Zephram Cochrane and two angles of his warp ship. The photos are odd- looking, printed on what appears to be some sort of cloth. \nBEVERLY There's a life sign behind this door... about ten meters below. \nGeordi moves to the door. \nGEORDI Blast door. It's designed to protect the control room when the missile is launched. \nPICARD There should be some kind of manual release... \nThey hunt around for a moment. Geordi runs his hand along the edge of the blast door. Picard turns to the Guards. \nPICARD (to Lange) Get those fires out and then try to restore main power to the control room. \nLANGE Aye, sir. \nThe Guards move off. \nGEORDI Got it, Captain. \nGeordi has found an emergency BOX with several pneumatic tubes and a hydraulic lever labeled \"emergency use only.\" He pulls down the lever, there is a hissing sound, and the blast door slowly SLIDES DOWN into the floor. We can now see the MISSILE SILO itself beyond the door. Picard, Geordi and Beverly step into... \n58   INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS                              58 \nPicard, Geordi and Beverly step onto the catwalk, which surrounds the Silo walls. In the middle is the WARP SHIP itself. It should look like an advanced ICBM missile with a COCKPIT in place of the warhead, and with numerous modifications to the fuselage. The cockpit is on the same level as the control room. On the side of the missile is the name \"Phoenix\". The missile itself extends down another FOUR STORIES. There are other catwalks below this one, with ladders connecting the different levels. Beverly sees something below. \nBEVERLY There. \n59   NEW ANGLE                                                   59 \nTwo catwalks below we can see a man sprawled on the grating. They all scramble down the ladders past the massive missile. (NOTE: Because of the design of the Silo, we will see the entire missile only in a few shots. For the most part, our view is limited to sections of the missile.) \nBeverly reaches the man, who is lying face-down on the metal grating. She scans him... \nBEVERLY Severe radiation exposure... \nGeordi looks over at the section of the missile on their level. The side panels have been removed, revealing complex circuitry within. \nPicard joins Beverly, who turns over the injured man. It's ZEPHRAM COCHRANE -- the man whose picture we saw on the Borg monitors. Beverly begins pulling devices out of her medkit, injects Cochrane with a hypospray. Cochrane is a man in his mid-forties. He has a youthful, dynamic appearance marred by recent radiation burns. \nPICARD It's Cochrane. \nBEVERLY I've stabilized him for now... but he's in a coma and he's going to need radiometric therapy. I want to take him to the ship. \nPicard nods, reaches into his pants pocket, takes out a combadge. \nPICARD Picard to Enterprise. (no response) Enterprise, please respond. \nGEORDI It could be the radiation, Captain. Try from the surface. \nPicard nods... then takes a deep breath, tries to orient himself to the task at hand... there's a lot at stake and a lot to do. He turns to Geordi. \nPICARD Mister La Forge, listen very carefully. If you remember your history... in less than twenty- four hours, a Vulcan ship will be passing through this system. When it does, this ship needs to be in space, flying at warp speed. \nGeordi takes a deep breath, it's a tall order. \nGEORDI I'd better get started. \nGeordi goes to work. Picard bends down and carefully hoists Cochrane up into a fireman's carry. Beverly follows him up the catwalk... \nCUT TO: \n60   EXT. MISSILE SILO - DAY                                     60 \nMinutes later. Cochrane is lying on the ground. Beverly is kneeling beside him, unfolding a portable stretcher from her medkit. Picard is checking two combadges with a tricorder. \nPICARD It's not the radiation... and there's nothing wrong with the combadges... the Enterprise just isn't responding. \nBEVERLY Jean-Luc, this man needs medical attention, now. \nPICARD As I recall, the town of Resurrection is about two kilometers East of here. They might have a hospital... \nPicard looks troubled at the thought. \n66   DATA'S POV                                                  66 \nAs the table gyrates, we REVEAL the ROOM slowly. And we realize we're in -- \n67   INT. BORG HIVE                                              67 \nThe Environmental Control Room seen earlier has now been transformed into the INNER-SANCTUM of the BORG. The room has a dark, moist, organic feel -- a tropical jungle of cybernetic equipment. \nThe Borg are altering the room, converting Starfleet technology and materials into the living, bio- mechanical look of the Borg. We see one Borg drone attach a small pod to a Starfleet console and activate it. The pod immediately sends out a COMPLEX WEB of BORG TECHNOLOGY which covers the Starfleet console inside and out. It's like weeds overpowering a flower bed -- within seconds the console has been BORGIFIED. \nThe walls, ceiling and floor are now honeycombed with the ALCOVES that make up the BORG COLLECTIVE. Borg drones are motionless in their alcoves, cabling and other conduits connecting them to various equipment... while other Borg are moving about the room, carrying out various modifications to the room. At one point, we see Ensign Porter. He's been completely Borgified. His skin pale, expression blank. No hint of humanity left. \n68   DATA                                                        68 \nstill strapped to the table, which is twisting and rotating, giving him frightening new glimpses of the room. A new image appears -- SIX BORG DRONES are clustered together in one section of the room, each with an elaborate series of hoses and conduits connected to its face. \nThrough the tubes we can see an exchange of FLUID and ENERGY pulsing back and forth -- some sort of bizarre \"feeding\" or \"renewal\" is going on. The tubes all seem to lead toward the ceiling. \nData is now horizontal on his back and the table LOCKS into position. A Borg drone OPENS A PANEL on the side of Data's head, and begins connecting a thick bundle of optical cabling to it. \nDATA (to Borg) Your efforts to assimilate me will be unsuccessful. \nThe Borg ignores him, activates a console... and the cabling connected to Data's head LIGHTS UP with power. They're trying to connect him to the Collective. \nData thinks for a moment, tilts his head slightly... and then suddenly there's a SHOWER of SPARKS from the cabling he's been connected to. The lights on the cable go out. Data has thwarted their attempts. \nDATA (to Borg) It would appear that resistance is not always futile. \nSuddenly a new VOICE is heard echoing through the room -- a woman's voice, low, seductive, deadly: \nWOMAN'S VOICE Brave words. I've heard them before from thousands of species across thousands of worlds... since long before you were created. \nData looks up toward... \n69   THE CEILING                                                 69 \nA RUSTLE of MOVEMNET somewhere in the cyber-tangle... almost like a snake slithering beneath the weeds. And for a brief instant we get a glimpse of a FACE unlike any Borg we've ever seen. The face of a woman. Pale- skinned... piercing eyes...raven hair slicked back... a hauntingly beautiful image in a sea of nightmarish technology. And then it's gone. \n70   DATA                                                        70 \nFrowns. He saw it, too, but he's not sure what to make of it. \nWOMAN'S VOICE But now... they are all one with the Borg. \nDATA I am unlike any lifeform you have encountered before. As an android, I am in complete control of my neural net. The information contained there cannot be forcibly removed. \nWOMAN'S VOICE You are an imperfect being... created by an imperfect being. Finding your weakness is only a matter of time. \nSuddenly three Borg drones converge on Data with various wicked-looking Borg devices. One of the Borg has a specialized cybernetic ARM, which EXTRUDES a series of stiletto-tipped DRILL SPIKES. As the six- inch spikes begin to BORE INTO Data's head... \nCUT TO: \n71   EXT. MONTANA - RESURRECTION CITY - DAY                      71 \nResurrection is a small town -- around 1,000 people -- a rural, Western community that's probably existed for at least two hundred years, and we can see the roots of the original ranching community in some of the architecture. But it's also a community of the 21st century. \nThe most striking feature of the town is that it sits in the middle of nearly a hundred WIND MILLS, which provide the only source of power for the town. The blades are enormous, but the structures supporting them are little more than simple poles. Some are sleek, fiberglass, futuristic... others have a more cobbled together, make-shift appearance. At the moment, only a few blades are turning in the gentle breeze. \nPicard and Beverly emerge from the nearby woods carrying the stretcher. They exchange a look at the sight of the city and then head toward it... \n72   EXT. RESURRECTION CITY - DAY                                72 \nA few minutes later. Picard and Beverly carrying Cochrane down the street toward the hospital at the end. As they walk along, we get our first taste of post-apocalyptic 21st century life: \nThis is a recognizable American community, but it's definitely a futuristic town. Clothing, architecture, technology -- all have changed over the course of seventy years. But it is a broken future. What used to be high-tech public COMPUTER TERMINALS are rusted and abandoned. We can see the corroded hulks of HOVER- CARS lying idle in the streets. Futuristic elements now useless. \nAt one point, they pass a large polyurethane TENT -- the inside surface is covered with condensation and we can see the silhouettes of people moving within. The entrance is guarded by a single Militia Guard. Later we will learn that this is a primitive greenhouse, the only place where they can grow uncontaminated food. \nWhat used to be a McDonald's, or some other recognizable food chain, has now been gutted and has been turned into a kind of blacksmith shop. People are fashioning metal into various tools using hammer and tongs. \nThe sidewalks are populated with PEOPLE, who congregate in small groups, quietly talking amongst themselves, others just staring vacantly off into space. Many of them have visible burn scars and damage to their bodies -- victims of the war and post-nuclear environmental dangers. A few of them are applying a special lotion to their arms and face -- protection against the toxic elements. A long FOOD LINE snakes around a block, as people line up to get their daily rations. \nA few people glance up at Picard and Beverly with curious or suspicious looks. This is not a community that welcomes strangers. At one point, they see a man dressed in futuristic CAMOUFLAGE carrying an automatic weapon -- we will learn he's a MILITIA SOLDIER. He stares at them with a neutral expression, then walks off. \nThe people here have that hollow-eyed, listless look about them. They're going through something that makes the Great Depression look like a minor inconvenience. But there's also a toughness to these people, a resilience and determination to survive in the face of overwhelming odds. We are looking at our future... and it's on the verge of collapse. \nCUT TO: \n73   INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY                        73 \nA short time later. Cochrane is being lifted onto an operating table. Picard and Beverly step back from the table as a DOCTOR and two NURSES look him over. The doctor is in his early fifties and has a weathered, tired look to him. The hospital itself is like the rest of the town -- a futuristic setting fallen on hard times. The light in the room is provided mostly from the sunlight streaming in through the windows. Light bulbs and other gear flicker dimly around the hospital -- we get the feeling they have very little power. \nDOCTOR How long has he been unconscious? \nBEVERLY At least four hours. \nWorf and a large SECURITY DETACHMENT -- a dozen or so men and women -- are moving down the Corridor with grim looks on their faces. They are carrying new powerful- looking phaser rifles and other equipment. The feeling is of an elite combat squad heading for a dangerous mission. They stop at one point and Worf lifts up a DECKPLATE, exposing a large HATCH in the floor. Worf hits his combadge. \nWORF Worf to Bridge. We're in position. \n85   INT. BRIDGE                                                 85 \nRiker in command, Troi nearby. Riker is standing at the security station looking at a monitor which displays a schematic graphic of the ship. The position of the security team is flashing -- we can see they are on Deck 46. \nRIKER This is the Bridge. I'm releasing the emergency force fields. \nHe nods to Troi, who works a console. \n86   INT. CORRIDOR                                                86 \nWorf and his team watch as the FORCEFIELD protecting the hatch flashes off. Worf reaches down and releases the hatch, which slides open with a soft whoosh. He glances at his men for a moment, then JUMPS down the hatch... \n87   INT. DECK 47 - CORRIDOR                                     87 \nAs Worf lands on his feet. The light is dim, no power on this deck, hard to see. He looks around warily for a moment, phaser at-the-ready, then activates his wrist beacon. We immediately notice that we can see Worf's breath -- it's freezing cold down here. He shines the light around the darkened corridor, then silently motions his arm for the others to follow. A beat, then we see the security officers start to drop into the corridor from the hatch above... \n88   NEW ANGLE - CORRIDOR                                        88 \nAs Worf's squad spreads out along the hall, weapons at- the-ready, everyone alert with fingers on the triggers. We see that the phaser rifles are equipped with their own light sources, intended to illuminate the target before you shoot at it. The Security Officers are constantly moving their lights back and forth through the chilly air. Worf gives hand signals -- holds up two fingers, then a fist, and points forward. \nTwo Guards trot down the corridor about fifteen feet, stop, and take up firing positions... then two more members of the team run down, leap frog ahead of them and take positions further down the corridor. Classic military deployment. Worf starts scanning with a tricorder. \nWORF (hits combadge) Worf to Bridge. \nRIKER'S COM VOICE Riker here. \nWORF There's a dampening field in place on this deck. Our tricorders are useless. \nThe team continue to explore Deck 47. It's spooky, eerie, a sense of menace around every corner. They open doors, check room by room, section by section, still no sign of the Borg in the freezing cold darkness. \n90   ANGLE ON SECURITY GUARD                                     90 \nThe Corridor directly ahead has been stripped of wall, ceiling and deck panels -- all the normal decorative Enterprise sheathing is gone, revealing the circuitry and machinery of the ship itself. Unlike the rest of the corridors, there does appear to be POWER flowing through some of the conduits up ahead, and it gives off an eerie glow. \nWe can also see that some of the machinery has been altered and changed -- not just the neat and orderly arrangement you'd expect to find behind bulkheads -- there's a sense of cross-circuitry, re-wiring, equipment being rearranged. Clearly, a lot of work has gone on in this area of the ship. Worf steps forward, examines the corridor closely. \nENSIGN HAWK What the hell is going on? \nWORF Borg... \nWorf signals the team forward, and they slowly begin picking their way down the Borgified Corridor. It's not easy -- they have to choose their footing carefully as they walk through the maze of cables, circuits, and machinery... Ensign Hawk accidentally steps on some circuitry, which gives off a BEEP. The entire team suddenly whirls their lights and weapons on the unfortunate Ensign, who pales at their sudden attention. \nWorf looks irritated, then motions his team to continue their search. They continue making their way down the spooky corridor... and as they turn a corner... \n92   NEW ANGLE - ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                92 \nwhere the machinery is now THICKER and more BORG-LIKE in appearance. Tubes and cabling hang down from the ceiling. If anything, it's even colder in here. The deeper they go, the worse it gets. We can now hear a low, sinister HUM of alien power. At the end of this corridor is the ENVIROMENTAL CONTROL ROOM, as seen earlier. The entire doorway is gone -- and a weird pulsing GLOW fills the room. Worf stops his team at the sight. From this vantage, we cannot see directly into the room, but clearly something is going on in there. \nWorf signals his men to spread out, and they take up positions around the Corridor, all weapons trained on Environmental Control. \nWORF Worf to Bridge. We're about to enter the Environmental Control Room. \nRIKER'S COM VOICE Any sign of Data, or the Borg themselves? \nAs Work and Riker continue talking, we MOVE TO Ensign Hawk, who is now the last man in the formation, covering the rear. He's shining his phaser-beacon into the empty darkness. He can't help looking back over his shoulder at the rest of the team and the distant Environmental Control Room -- that seems to be where the action is. As he turns, his beacon moves with him, throwing the Corridor behind them in and out of darkness. \nWORF (continuing) Negative. However, they've reconfigured the ODN network... and re-routed all power on this deck into Environmental Control. \nAs Worf speaks, Ensign Hawk turns back, but this time when he shines his beacon into the darkness, something MOVES in the distance -- a shadow. The Ensign freezes, brings his rifle up. But did he see it, or was it his imagination? \nA tense beat as he waits, heart pounding... but nothing happens. On the wall next to his head we see what can only be described as a BIO-MECHANISTIC CABLE creeping out of the wall... which begins slowly heading for the Ensign's neck. Just as he begins to sense that something is happening behind him, the cable WHIPS OUT around his neck and YANKS him deep into the bed of circuitry in the blink of an eye -- the motion so fast we have trouble following it. \nWorf turns his head at the sound. \nWORF Stand by, Commander (to team) Where's Ensign Hawk? \nEveryone looks around, surprised that he's not there. Everyone is alert, keyed up. The tension is thick. Utter silence, except for the hum of the machinery and the frosty breathing of the team. \nRIKER'S COM VOICE Worf? Is something wrong? \nWORF Something is very wrong, Commander. We're falling back. \nWorf gives hand signals for the team to move out. But just as they start to fall back, everything happens at once. \n93   BORG DRONES                                                 93 \nEXPLODE OUT OF THE WALLS, CEILING AND FLOOR! What follows is a BLUR of action happening so fast and furious we never get a true sense of what's happening. \nA flurry of violence and motion and images: \n-- A snarling Borg face -- half-human, half-machine, a cybernetic nightmare. \nPicard considers, absently sticks his hand in his jacket pocket. He pulls out the canister of balm Scrimm gave him and tosses it onto the table. \nPICARD Could you reconstruct the throttle from a photograph like this... if that man wasn't blocking the view? \nGeordi thinks it over. \nGEORDI Maybe... (beat) Sure. Yeah. As long as I could get a clear look at the intake configuration. But so far, we haven't found any other photos. \nPICARD (staring at photos) If there are other photographs... I think I may know how to find them. \nCUT TO: \n100   INT. BORG HIVE                                             100 \nIt's a while later, and the Borg are making progress. Data is strapped to the table, PANELS open on his HEAD and CHEST. Three Borg drones are working methodically on his inner-circuitry. The jagged voice of the woman cuts in: \nWOMAN'S VOICE Your resistance is... illogical. To us, your neural net is simply another piece of technology. We will learn its secrets. \nData stares at the murky ceiling. \nDATA Who are you? \nWOMAN'S VOICE I am the Borg. \nDATA That is a contradiction. The Borg act as a collective consciousness. There are no individuals. \nWOMAN'S VOICE I am the beginning... the end. I am the one who is many. I am the Borg. \nOut of the mist that hugs the top of the room DESCENDS the BORG QUEEN. \nShe is unlike any of the Borg drones we've ever seen -- a humanoid female with conduits and tubes running out of her body. She has no legs. Her torso is SUSPENDED by a complex rig of CABLES and HYDRAULICS. Her face and upper-torso are much more humanoid, with the pasty- pale white of Borg flesh. Her EYES have a silvery glint to them. Her demeanor is seductive and sensual in contrast to the harsh, mechanical surroundings. She is an eerie blend of two worlds -- organic and mechanical. \nWith the soft HISS of hydraulics, she LOWERS herself down to where her face is very close to that of Data's. Her features are almost angelic, but the silvery glint in her eyes betrays an inner-darkness. \nDATA You are the guiding intelligence behind the Borg...? \nBORG QUEEN Intelligence... ambition... desire... I bring order to chaos... \nShe studies his face with a certain child-like quality. \nBORG QUEEN It's unfortunate we will have to destroy you to obtain the information we need. You are a... unique lifeform. (beat) Synthetic... and yet far more than a simple automaton. You have no idea how close to perfection you are. \nShe stares at him intently, and we get the hint that her interest in Data may go beyond simple assimilation. She seems fascinated by him. Data picks up on this. \nDATA How do you define perfection? \nThe Queen opens her arms slightly, clearly indicating herself. \nBORG QUEEN A blending of the organic and the synthetic. The highest form of life in the galaxy. \nData eyes her, considering. \nDATA An interesting definition. But it is not one that applies to me. I am completely artificial. I have no organic components. \nShe looks at him as a new thought crosses her mind. She might've just found the chink in Data's armor. \nBORG QUEEN Have you ever wondered what it's like to have flesh? \nDATA It is impossible to imagine sensations for which I have no frame of reference. \nShe smiles. \nBORG QUEEN That... can change. \nThe Queen looks to the three Borg drones and gives them a silent command. The drones immediately stop working on Data's open panels... and shift their attention to his right ARM. One of the drones tears off the sleeve on Data's uniform, exposing his bare arm. Another then uses a small cutting device to SLICE OFF the synthetic skin from Data's arm. As Data prepares himself for the worst... \n101   INT. ENTERPRISE CORRIDOR                                   101 \nTHREE armored SECURITY GUARDS with phaser rifles run into view, hit a control panel on the wall. A giant EMERGENCY BULKHEAD comes SLAMMING down, cutting off the rest of the corridor. \nThe security guards turn to run down the hall, but then there is a high-pitched shriek of wrenching metal. They drop to the deck and take combat stances. \nGUARD #1 Set phasers to rotating modulation! \nThey make adjustments to their weapons just as the bulkhead doors EXPLODE INWARD in a blinding flash. The guards shield themselves against the fire and debris... looks up just in time to see the swift and lethal shapes of the BORG jumping through the smashed bulkhead, racing down the corridor toward them. The guards FIRE, and when they do the PHASER BLASTS alternate color -- red, blue, green, purple, orange -- a staccato of colors as the phasers shift frequency. \nThe phaser blasts TAKE DOWN a few of the BORG... but then we see the distinctive PERSONAL FORCEFIELDS of the other Borg begin to compensate, and the phasers no longer affect them. \nGUARD #1 That's it, they've adjusted -- fall back! \nThey turn to run but BORG PHASER FIRE lances out from the Borg soldiers and RIPS them apart. \nCUT TO: \n102   INT. BRIDGE                                                102 \nRUBY \"Money.\" So you can get dome money... \nPICARD I can try. \nRUBY You'd have to try real hard. No one's used currency in over ten years. What are you, from another planet? \nPicard hesitates, smiles at her, tries to laugh it off. \nPICARD No... but sometimes I feel that way. (beat) What I meant was, I'd be willing to trade for the photographs. \nRUBY Trade. Okay. The photographs... for a straight answer. (beat) Who are you? And how do you know Zephram? \nPICARD I'm an old friend... I met him when he was doing his undergraduate work at Cornell back in -- \nRUBY (cuts him off) 'Fraid not. \nRuby walks past him with the X-ray... \n106   INT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS                        106 \nPicard follows Ruby out into the corridor. She has a satisfied smile on her face -- it's not easy to put one over on this woman. And the truth is, she's enjoying Picard's frustration. As they walk along... \nPICARD What? \nRUBY (casual) You're lying. \nPICARD What makes you say that? \nRUBY You're not someone who lies very easily... so it's obvious when you do... at least to me. \nPICARD Are you always sucha good judge of character? \nShe stops, turns, looks at him. \nRUBY Always. \nRuby turns and walks off. Picard follows her, doggedly determined to get those photos... \n107   INT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - NIGHT                     107 \nBeverly is holding the X-ray glass Ruby made up to the light, as the Doctor seen earlier looks on. \nBEVERLY The occipital fracture is widening... we're going to have to fuse the bones... \nDOCTOR I'm a little worried about some of these bone fragments. If they move any closer to the brain, we could be looking at a hemorrhage. \nAs Beverly and the Doctor examine the X-ray, we MOVE TO Ruby, who's looking down at Cochrane. He's still in bed and on a respirator. She smoothes his hair with affection. Picard stands on the other side of the bed, watching her. \nPICARD Were the two of you... involved? \nRUBY No... not like you and Doctor Crusher used to be. \nPICARD (surprised) How did you know about that? \nRuby looks at him with a smile. \nRUBY I didn't. \nHer smile widens, and then she leaves the bed to join the Doctor and Beverly. Picard shakes his head and smiles after her -- chagrinned and amused at the same time. \nRUBY (to Doctor) We can't take any more X-rays until I can mix up a new batch of the silver halide. \nDOCTOR Can you do it tonight? We may have to operate. \nRUBY Sure. It'll be ready by morning. \nRuby turns and heads for the door. Picard moves after her. \nPICARD Ruby... I need to talk to you about those photographs. It's very important. \nRUBY I'm sure it is. But it'll have to wait until tomorrow. \nPICARD It can't wait until tomorrow... \nRUBY Too bad. (beat) Besides, it'll give you all night to think up a new set of lies. \nShe flashes him that smile again, then darts out the door. Picard is left frustrated -- he knows that he can't let it go at that... \nCUT TO: \n108   INT. ENTERPRISE - ENGINEERING                              108 \nWorf and a team of TEN SECURITY GUARDS are preparing for battle. They're setting up large, heavy-duty phaser equivalents of machine guns --  big, mean-looking weapons on tripods. There are two of these weapons aimed at each entrance to Engineering. The Security Officers are strapping on body armor, checking weapons, building makeshift barricades over each of the doors. \nWorf is in command, directing the action. \nDATA I do not know what you are referring to. \nBORG QUEEN That's because you haven't been properly... stimulated yet. \nA WHOOSH of hydraulic power signals another movement by the Borg Queen. She slithers through the air and down slightly, so that she is on the same level as Data. She looks at the cybernetic shell that is encasing Data's right arm, which OPENS at her silent command and moves away... \nWe can now see that all of the skin has been removed from Data's right arm, showing the INNER-WORKINGS of his android limb -- circuitry and servos, etc. But on the top of the mechanical forearm there is something new -- a small PATCH of HUMAN FLESH held in place with various nasty-looking hooks and clamps and small tubes carrying blood. It's a delicate, fragile piece of organic life on an ugly, mechanical surface. \nData looks down at the patch of flesh with a little puzzlement. \nBORG QUEEN (re: flesh) Do you know what this is, Data? \nDATA It would appear that you are attempting to graft organic skin onto my endo-skeletal structure. \nBORG QUEEN What a cold description... for such a beautiful gift. \nShe smiles slightly, utterly confident. She leans her face in close to Data's still immobilized right arm. \n117   EXTREME CLOSE UP - DATA'S ARM                              117 \nWe are so close to the patch of flesh that we can see the individual hairs. The Borg Queen's LIPS move into frame, and she EXHALES a long and sensuous breath. We see GOOSE BUMPS form on the skin, and the hairs stand straight up in response. \n118   NEW ANGLE                                                  118 \nAs Data's eyes widen and he looks down at the skin in surprise -- this is a sensation he's never felt before. The Borg Queen sees the look on his face and smiles. \nBORG QUEEN Was that good for you? \nData can barely describe the sensation. But clearly, it was pleasurable. \nDATA It was... interesting. \nHe looks at her. \nDATA Do it again... please. \nAs she smiles... \nCUT TO: \n119   EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                  119 \nA tiny, single-story house -- one or two rooms at the most, in serious need of repair and maintenance. No yard. The house sits on dirt. The nearest other structure is at least a hundred yards away. A very solitary place. The windows are dark, painted over from the inside. \nSome large pieces of exotic-looking EQUIPMENT are sitting off the front porch. \nAfter a beat, the front door opens, letting out a soft, feeble light. \nRuby steps out onto the porch, carrying a gallon size plastic jug. The light from the house now lights the equipment a little, giving us a better view. There's a contraption that appears to be a PUMP of some kind, with a funnel on top, spigot at the bottom, and several stages of filters and tubing in between. Ruby sets the jug underneath the spigot... then sits down for a moment on the edge of the porch. She takes a breath and runs a hand through her hair, stretches her back, trying to work out some of the kinks in her neck. An exhausting day. \n120   PICARD                                                     120 \nis watching her intently from afar. He's concealed behind a supporting beam of one the town's many WINDMILLS. He's in shadow, hidden from Ruby's view. \n121   RUBY                                                       121 \npulls off her jacket. she's wearing a pull-over shirt... and in one motion she pulls off the shirt, revealing only a tee-shirt underneath, sleeves torn off long ago. She stands up... kicks off her boots... undoes her pants... and begins sliding the jeans off her hips... \n122   PICARD                                                     122 \nis surprised. Glances around, a little awkward. This really isn't why he came out here. \n123   RUBY                                                       123 \nkicks aside the jeans. She's now down to tee-shirt and panties. She grabs the bottom of the tee-shirt... pulls it off... \n124   PICARD                                                     124 \ndoesn't want to look, but can't help himself... \n125   RUBY                                                       125 \nmoves to the side of the porch... and steps into a large ENVIROMENTAL SUIT, a bulky one-piece with gloves and helmet attached. \n126   PICARD                                                     126 \nis a little relieved... keeps watching... \n127   RUBY                                                       127 \nhas now encased herself in the thick, rubbery suit... pulls over a HELMET with a gas mask. She walks over to an OIL DRUM marked with a distinctive BIO-HAZARD SYMBOL. She carefully opens the lid... takes a metal pitcher... reaches down into the drum and scoops out a pitcher-full of TOXIC WASTE. She closes the lid, walks over to the pump-filter contraption. She pours the sludge-like waste into the funnel...primes the pump... makes a few adjustments to the filters... and then turns the spigot... \nAfter a beat, a trickle of CLEAR LIQUID starts to come out of the spigot. Ruby steps back and pulls off the helmet. \n128   PICARD                                                     128 \nPicard is starting to get angry. \nPICARD Why are you being so difficult? All I'm asking for is to look at one of the photographs. It'll take five minutes. \nRUBY And all I'm asking for is the truth. That would take five minutes. (beat) For all I know, you caused the explosions at the silo... and now you're trying to steal Zephram's ship. \nPICARD I am not a thief... \nRuby's had enough -- her temper flares and she gets off the couch, takes a threatening step toward Picard. \nRUBY No, you're a petty burglar and a liar... (beat) You're no friend of Zephram's. He is a great man. He's not like you or me or any of the other zombies walking around this town. \nPicard jumps in with a quiet, forceful quality: \nPICARD No. He's a man with vision. He can see beyond the problems that surround us. He knows there's a better future out there for everyone... a future where crime, poverty and war are things of the past... a future where we reach out and seek our destiny in the stars. (beat) I believe in that future, too, Ruby. I believe in it in every fiber of my being. And I'm telling you... if we don't launch that warp ship tomorrow, there's a very good chance that future will never happen. \nShe eyes him for a moment -- and we're not sure if his words have had any effect. \nRuby still has her doubts, but decides to go with her gut...and finally hands him the photographs. Picard glances through them -- his expression tells us the photo he needs is in there. \nPICARD You won't regret this. \nThey share a look... and then Picard turns and walks off into the night. Ruby watches him go... and we can see on her face a confused jumble of mixed emotions. Something about that man has touched her... \n135   NIGHT SCPOE POV                                            135 \nA telescopic, green and white image of Picard walking away from Ruby's home. \n136   LIEUTENANT SCRIMM                                          136 \nis watching Picard through a set of night vision binoculars, perched on the roof of a nearby building. He frowns, wondering what Picard is up to... \nCUT TO: \n137   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE DEFLECTOR DISH                     137 \nThe giant DEFLECTOR ARRAY at the front of the ship -- a giant, round, bowl-shaped array used for communications and shielding. As we watch, FOUR HATCHES OPEN surrounding the dish and BORG start to emerge from the interior of the ship and CRAWL OUT on the hull. The Borg do not need pressure suits or breathing equipment -- they crawl around the hull with ease and onto the deflector dish... \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL: \n138   INT. ENTERPRISE BRIDGE - VIEWSCREEN                        138 \nWhere Riker, Troi, Worf and N.D.s are watching this image on the Viewscreen. \nRIKER What are they doing? \nWORF They appear to be modifying the deflector dish. \nTROI To do what? If they wanted a weapon, they could've taken over a phaser bank or torpedo bay... \nRIKER Deflector dish... why the deflector dish...? \nWORF It doesn't make sense. The deflector is only used for shielding and long range sensors... \nRiker stares at the screen... notices something. \nRIKER Computer -- magnify grid twenty- one alpha. \nThe image on the Viewscreen ZOOMS IN to a specific point on the deflector dish, giving us a clear view of two Borg who have opened a gigantic panel on the dish. They appear top be modifying power conduits in some fashion. \nWORF They're re-routing the deflector power conduits... \nRIKER Computer -- thermal enhancement. \nThe image now is overlaid with an INFRARED VIEW of what they're doing. The power conduits are glowing bright red, very hot -- we can see the heat signature travel back behind the dish and connect to a corkscrew-shaped coil, which is pulsing. \nRIKER They're connecting the conduits to subspace communications... \nWORF (realizing) They're converting the deflector dish into an antennae... \nTROI They may be trying to send a message to the other Borg...the Borg in this time period... \nWORF What kind of message? \nRIKER (thinking) If it was me... I'd say \"attack Earth now... in the 21st century... they'll be too strong in the 24th.\" \nThey think about this for a moment as they watch the Borg swarming on the deflector array. \nWORF We have to stop them from sending that message. \nRIKER Agreed. Options? \nWORF Destroy the deflector dish. \nTROI Can we aim our dorsal phasers at it? \nCOCHRANE Let me get this straight... you're from the future... I'm about to change history... and all I have to do is sit here and let you fly my ship? \n145   WIDER                                                      145 \nPicard, Geordi and Beverly are standing around Cochrane, who is sitting in a high-backed chair in a corner of the Control Room. \nPICARD That's right. \nHe studies their faces -- sees they're serious. He smiles a little ruefully. \nCOCHRANE And people say I'm crazy... \nPicard smiles. \nPICARD I assure you, Doctor, that after today... no one will ever call you that again. \nCochrane considers them...finally nods, what the hell. \nCOCHRANE Just do me a favor... bring my ship back in one piece. \nPICARD That's a promise. \nPicard turns and walks off with Beverly. Geordi moves to Cochrane with a little bit of awe. \nGEORDI Doctor... my name is Geordi La Forge. I'm an engineer. Can I shake your hand? \nCochrane is touched by Geordi's obvious respect. They shake hands. \nCOCHRANE I wish I could go with you. Is there anything I can do to help? \nGEORDI Not really... but I do have about a thousand questions I've always wanted to ask you. \nCOCHRANE Since time is short... why don't you pick the top ten and fire away? \nGeordi smiles... \n146   PICARD AND BEVERLY                                         146 \nhave moved to another part of the room. Beverly looks exhausted. She sets her medkit on a table and plops down into a chair. Mid-conversation. \nPICARD (surprised) You actually performed surgery...? \nBEVERLY It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread... \nShe looks up with a smile, pulls a small DEVICE out of the medkit -- a surgical transporter. \nBEVERLY (re: device) But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain. \nPICARD How did Doctor Almack react to that? \nBEVERLY He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed. (beat) Any word from the Enterprise? \nPICARD Not yet. \nBEVERLY You think they're still up there? \nPICARD (wry) If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana. \nBEVERLY (light) That might not be so bad... at least for you. \nShe's kidding, but Picard is a little defensive. \nPICARD What's that supposed to mean? \nThere is no animosity or hint of jealousy in Beverly's attitude, she's simply making an observation about someone she cares about. \nBEVERLY I saw the way you looker at her... and I know that look. \nPicard doesn't want to argue about this -- to him, it's a pointless conversation. \nPICARD Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that. \nBEVERLY You want some advice? Don't do this again. (off his look) You know exactly what I mean. \nPICARD Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I... \nBEVERLY I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our \"sense of duty.\" We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not. \nShe holds his look for a moment. \nPICARD (neutral) I have a ship to launch. \nPicard turns and leaves. Beverly watches him go... wondering whether her words had any affect... \n147   EXT. RUBY'S HOUSE - DAY                                    147 \nEveryone nods. Riker goes to a wall panel and activates the control. The Airlock door seen earlier OPENS. Riker turns back to Troi. \nTROI Good luck. \nRiker nods. Then he, Worf, and the Guards ENTER the airlock and Troi close the door behind them. \n153   INT.

They begin to walk out of the airlock... \n154   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - AIRLOCK                          154 \nAs Riker and his team come out of the airlock on the top of the saucer section. It's a spectacular sight as the small group of figures, with weapons at the ready, marches toward the leading edge of the saucer. The scene is lit by light reflected by the Earth, which hangs above the ship. \n155   ON RIKER & WORF                                            155 \nAs they approach the edge. Worf gives a hand signal and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical deployment and drops down onto their bellies. They crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause. Worf looks at Riker, who looks a little queasy. \nWORF (to Riker) Are you alright? \nRIKER Just a little queasy... \nWORF Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship. \nRIKER Right. \nWORF And Commander, whatever you do... do not vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant. \nRIKER I'll keep that in mind. \nRiker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself. \nRIKER (to all) Over and under! \nThey all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the underside of the saucer. \nThe CAMERA ROTATES AND SPINS with them as they traverse to the underside of the hull -- they're upside down relative to their previous position, but there's no up or down in space and their magnetized suits hold them to the hull. \nIt's a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to their new position. From this angle, the Enterprise appears to be upside down! \nOnce they're on the underside of the saucer, they can see the rest of the ship laid out above them. \n156   NEW ANGLE - THEIR POV                                      156 \nThe deflector dish (which is now above us) is covered with dozens of Borg drones, who are working to modify it. Some of them turn and see us. \n157   RIKER AND WORF                                             157 \nBegin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer. (Running is difficult, they must keep one foot on the hull at all times.) Several Borg PHASER SHOTS whip past them as the Borg open fire. \n158   THE BORG                                                   158 \nA DOZEN of them leave the work on the dish and begin skittering down (which is normally up) the interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes like a swarm of ants -- a frightening sight. \n159   A SECURITY GUARD                                           159 \nIs HIT by a phaser shot and goes FLYING OFF into space. \n160   THE TORPEDO TUBE                                           160 \nRiker reaches the opening to the torpedo tube, bends down and opens the hatch. Borg phaser shots hitting all around him. The open hatch cover provides some protection from the Borg fire. \nRIKER Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes! \nWORF Understood! \nWorf and his team lie down on the hull and begin exchanging fire with the approaching mass of Borg. \nThey pick off a few Borg, who also go FLYING into space. As Riker begins to work... \nCUT TO: \n161   INT. MISSILE SILO - SERIES OF SHOTS                        161 \nQuick cuts: \nENSIGN (off console) Tractor beam engaged.

I am a space-man. \nScrimm smirks at him -- what gall this guy has. But Ruby seems to discern some deeper meaning in Picard's words. She frowns in puzzlement. \nRUBY (quiet) Truth... he's telling the truth... \nPicard looks at Ruby, and at that moment something on a console behind her catches his eye: a LIGHT on Beverly's SURGICAL TRANSPORTER is now FLASHING. No one else notices. \nSCRIMM You're an entertaining man, Mister Picard. But you're also full of shit. \nScrimm cocks back the hammer on the pistol he's holding to Ruby's head. The following happens very quickly: \n-- Picard reaches out his hand, trying to stop Scrimm. \nPICARD Now, Geordi! \n-- The gun in Scrimm's hand DEMATERIALIZES. Scrimm reacts in shock. \n-- Instantly, the gun REMATERIALIZES in Picard's outstretched hand. He quickly pushes the barrel to Scrimm's forehead. \nPICARD Actually, you're full of shit. \nEveryone is in the room stunned by what's happened. Picard takes charge before anyone can recover. \nPICARD (continuing) Now, tell your men to drop their weapons. \nThere's a beat, but then Scrimm sees he has little choice. \nSCRIMM Weapons... down. \nThe other militia soldiers drop their weapons, which are quickly picked up by Beverly and a Starfleet N.D. Picard hands his gun to Lange, who covers Scrimm with it. \nRuby turns to Picard. \nAs the Phoenix rockets into space... \n209   INT.

Data is now a completely new being. His entire BODY is now made of HUMAN FLESH. It's a shocking sight -- for anyone who ever wondered what Data would look like human, we're now getting our first look. \n213   THE BORG QUEEN                                             213 \nDESCENDS from her nest in the ceiling. She watches Data for a moment... rubs the moisture into his face. \nBORG QUEEN A Borg in all but name. \nData, although clearly enraptured with his new sensations and feelings still struggles to maintain his own sense of identity. \nDATA (weak) I am... grateful for what you have given me. But I still do not wish to be assimilated. \nBORG QUEEN A universe of sensation is waiting for you... don't you want to explore it... with me? \nTo his surprise, Data finds that he is becoming drawn to this strange creature and all that she can offer him. \nDATA Yes... \nBORG QUEEN Then take the final step... give me the Enterprise... and we can be together... always. \nHe struggles, but ultimately there's only one answer. \nDATA No... I cannot. \nWithout taking her eyes away from Data, she reaches out a hand and touches a control on a nearby console. The color of Data's FACE turns an ASHEN GRAY --  as though the blood has drained from his skin. Another droplet of moisture falls and hits him on the cheek -- but this time his eyes widen in shock. \nThe sensation of human feeling is gone. \nBORG QUEEN I've deactivated the sensory inputs. That flesh on your body is just meat, now. \nDATA No... no, please... you cannot... \nShe moves in close on him, an edge creeping into her voice: \nBORG QUEEN You must give me what I want... now. Without the deflector dish, we can no longer send for an early invasion. We must assimilate Earth ourselves. I need this ship. \nShe hits the control, and the COLOR returns to his face. Data gasps -- filled with feeling once again. The Borg Queen runs her hand across his cheek -- her attitude seductive and affectionate once again. \nBORG QUEEN Isn't it better like this...? \nDATA Yes... but the Enterprise... my duty... \nBORG QUEEN ... is to yourself. Don't make me hurt you again... \nShe touches the control again. Data is shocked back into his cold, android self. He's like a heroin addict being denied his \"high\" with the flick of a switch. \nDATA No... no, it's so... empty... please... give it back... I need it... \nBORG QUEEN And I need to control this ship. Let me into your mind. \nData struggles, anguished... we've never seen him like this before... completely beaten down... finally, he nods. The Borg Queen touches the control again. A sharp intake of breath as the feeling returns to Data. And the Queen kisses him on the mouth. \nThis time, he responds eagerly, throwing himself into the emotion of the moment. She pulls back a little, looks at him softly, passionately. Data stares back at her, breathless -- he seems to be completely in her thrall. \nDATA In order to access my neural net... you will need to create a positronic interface.

But until then, you'll have to make do with what you've got. \nBEVERLY That'll be interesting. \nA WOMAN'S VOICE: \nRUBY'S VOICE What happened to him? \nEveryone turns. \n80   NEW ANGLE                                                   80 \nrevealing RUBY SLOANE standing at the front of Cochrane's bed. A striking woman in her mid-to-late thirties -- dark hair, tall, lean, beautiful under normal circumstances but at the moment she's not at her best, it looks like she's just come in from a hard day's work. She's wearing an old lab coat. But the most striking quality of all is the innate intelligence we can see in her eyes. \nShe's looking directly at Picard for an answer. Picard realizes he has to say something. He looks into her eyes and there is a moment here -- a brief spark of chemistry that in normal circumstances the Captain just might follow up. But at the moment, he shoves that electric feeling aside and tries to give her an answer. \nPICARD There was some kind of explosion out at the missile silo... \nShe looks at him for a moment, her eyes boring into him without expression, as though probing the truthfulness of his statement. \nDOCTOR Ruby, we're going to need a series of cranial X-rays tonight. \nRUBY (nods) I have a fresh set of plates at home. I'll have them here by eight. \nShe turns back to Cochrane, moves to his side, gently takes his hand and looks at him with sad affection. \nRUBY (quiet) Take care of him. He's a very special man. \nPICARD Yes, he is. \nShe looks up at Picard, and again there's a slight feeling of chemistry in the air. And then she turns and starts to walk out of the room. Picard's combadge BEEPS. Reactions. \nGEORDI'S COM VOICE La Forge to Picard. \nRUBY (stopping) I think there's someone in your pants. \nPICARD Excuse me. I have a... telephone call. \nPicard takes a few steps away, pulls the combadge out of his pants pocket, taps it. Ruby watches him a beat, then walks out of the room. \nPICARD Picard here. \nGEORDI'S COM VOICE Captain, we have a problem. I think you'd better get back here. \nPICARD I'm on my way. Picard out. \nPicard moves to Beverly. \nPICARD (sotto) I have to go back to the silo. Will you be all right? \nBEVERLY I'll be fine. (re: Cochrane) He's a different story. \nBeverly begins examining the medical equipment she'll have to work with as Picard exits... \n81   EXT. RESURRECTION CITY STREET - DAY                         81 \nA short time later. Picard walking down the main street back toward the gates. People passing him, taking no notice of him...Picard's mind thinking ahead. He happens to glance down a side street, then he stops. \n82   NEW ANGLE                                                   82 \nLooking down the side street. Ruby, the mysterious woman from the hospital, is walking along with a camera bag now slung over her shoulder. She stops for a moment as she passes the hulk of a burnt-out old hover car... stares at it...then pulls a home-made FUTURISTIC CAMERA out of her bag and snaps a picture of the car. She continues on her way. Picard is intrigued -- wonders about this woman and what it is she could be taking a picture of. Just then -- \nMAN'S VOICE Catch. \nPicard turns just in time to catch a small, metal canister with a screw-top. \nThe man who threw it steps into view. It's LIEUTENANT SCRIMM. Scrimm is the head of the town's militia. While not a physically threatening man, there is a quietly disturbing quality about him which conveys an intelligence laced with a tightly reined volatility. He's wearing futuristic combat fatigues and always carries a sidearm. Before the war, Scrimm was probably one of the \"survivalists\" who used to be dismissed as radicals until their predictions of Armageddon came true. At the moment, Scrimm is presenting his friendliest face to Picard. \nSCRIMM (pleasant) Think you'll need that. \nPicard eyes the canister, not sure what to make of it. \n", "test1_true": "He points to the sky. \nPICARD Oh...  yes... ultraviolet protection. Thank you. Mister...? \nSCRIMM Lieutenant, actually. Lieutenant Jonathan Scrimm. I'm the head of the Resurrection Protective Force. (beat) And you are? \nPICARD Jean-Luc Picard. \nSCRIMM Great name. French? \nPICARD Yes. \nSCRIMM You don't sound French. \nScrimm is still smiling at him, but his eyes never leave Picard. \nPICARD I was raised in England and here in the States. Thank you for the... no zone. \nPicard begins to walk away, not wanting to engage any citizens of the town. Scrimm falls in next to him. \nSCRIMM Where in the States? \nPICARD Oh... here and there. You know how it is. \nSCRIMM Not really. I was born and raised right here. Never had much use for travel. \nHe casually steps in front of Picard, blocking his way. \nSCRIMM Where are you from most recently? \nPICARD (thinking fast) California. San Francisco. \nSCRIMM Beautiful city. Used to be, anyway. I didn't think anyone still lived there. \nPICARD There's a few of us left. \nPicard steps around him and continues walking down the street. Scrimm waits a beat, then walks after him again. \nSCRIMM That was a pretty clever trick you did with the hospital's batteries. How'd you do it? \nPICARD It wasn't a trick. I used to be an electrical engineer. \nSCRIMM Huh. \nHe steps in front of Picard again, still pleasant but a little bit of a smile fading from his face. Picard realizes he isn't going to shake this man so easily. \nSCRIMM And what were you doing out at the missile silo? \nPICARD I'm an old friend of Cochrane's... I wanted to see how he was doing. \nSCRIMM Lucky for him you came by when you did. He might be dead now. \nPICARD Yes. \nSCRIMM Maybe you can tell me what he's been doing in that silo. We heard some explosions out there this morning... \nPICARD I think he was running a test on an old rocket engine... and one of the fuel cells burst. \nScrimm eyes him evenly. \nSCRIMM You seem to have an answer for everything. \nPICARD Something wrong with that? \nSCRIMM Not yet. \nA tense beat. Then Scrimm smiles easily. \nSCRIMM (re: balm) Be sure you put that on. You need a lot of protection around here. \nHe holds Picard's eyes for a moment. \nPICARD Thank you. But I've never had much trouble protecting myself. \nNow it's Picard's turn to smile pleasantly at Scrimm. Picard walks around him and heads for the gates. Scrimm watches him go with a thoughtful expression -- clearly, he's more than a little suspicious... \nCUT TO: \n83   EXT.

From their prone positions, they try to keep the Borg at bay, BLASTING them off the hull one by one. They have taken cover behind some outcroppings of equipment on the hull of the ship. The Borg have to cross an open field of metal to get to them, making then easy targets. \nSuddenly the Borg change tactics. From the deflector dish high above them, Borg begin LAUNCHING THEMSELVES directly at the Starfleet Officers, jumping off the dish and flying through the vacuum of space like paratroopers. This tips the balance. There are too many targets to defend from above and below. One of the flying Borg CRASHES into a Security Guard and a vicious hand-to-hand FIGHT erupts. The Borg SLASHES the guard's pressure suit, which DEPRESSURIZES killing the man instantly. Worf FIRES  a phaser blast into the Borg, knocking him off the hull and into space. \nWorf turns to Riker. \nWORF Commander, you're five minutes are up! \n170   RIKER                                                      170 \nswings the torpedo tube into place, aiming it at the deflector dish.

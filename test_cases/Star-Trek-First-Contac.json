{"test1_input": "Star Trek: First Contact \nStory by Rick Berman & Brannon Braga & Ronald D. Moore \nScreenplay by Brannon Braga & Ronald D. Moore \nFirst Draft \nSeptember 29, 1995 \n1   A BLACK VOID                                                 1 \nWe can hear movement. Strange skittering sounds, like razor-claws on metal... the hiss of pneumatic hoses... the whirr and click of servos... liquid gurgling... an eerie, alien cacophony. \n2   EARTH                                                        2 \nappears, hanging now in the starry blackness. The alien noises continue, and far in the distance we hear the muffled THUMP of what could be a distant explosion. Alien TEXT suddenly appears next to Earth, and we REVEAL we are in -- \n3   INT. BORG RECON CENTER                                       3 \nThe image of Earth is actually on a monitor, which is only one of DOZENS of MONITORS covering a huge wall. We don't see anything of the rest of the room, but the technology in view is distinctly alien and bizarre -- a mixture of organic and mechanical elements. Circuitry and optical cabling are side-by-side with what looks almost like arteries and organs. We can still hear the creepy skittering and gurgling noises. Occasionally, a SHADOWY FORM sweeps past the camera, vaguely humanoid but we can't tell who or what it is. \nAll of the monitors are active, and they present myriad IMAGES and SOUND -- all related to EARTH HISTORY. The screens show everything from written Chinese... to Renaissance paintings... to black and white newsreel footage of World War Two... to what look like clips of space battles from the 24th century. The entire range of human history dancing across the monitors. The effect is dizzying -- we get the feeling that whoever is watching this is studying the human race. \nThere is another THUMP and the wall of monitors SHUDDERS slightly. We hear the VOICE of what we will come to know as the BORG COLLECTIVE -- thousands of voices speaking at once : \nBORG Restrict search parameters to 1-9- 9-8 through 2-0-8-4. \nThe images on the monitors now change to show us images from 21ST CENTURY Earth history. \nAgain, it's a collection of still photography, video footage, text, artwork, etc. We hear snippets of sound- bites, music, speeches from the period. A lot of enticing details. As the images race across the monitors, we should learn the following. \n-- The turn of the 21st century brought chaos. Regional wars, the collapse of the United Nations. Societal break-down. Crime, starvation, desperation. \n-- A Third World War. Nuclear explosions, environmental disasters, tens of millions dead. The United States ceases to exist. All political authority vanishes. Humanity teetering on the edge of the Second Dark Age. \n-- The image of a single man -- ZEPHRAM COCHRANE. A visionary scientist. He see the spacecraft he created out of a nuclear missile. He flies the first warp test, breaking the light barrier. It changes history. \n-- Grainy black and white images of a VULCAN SCOUT SHIP landing on Earth. They saw Cochrane's flight, followed him back to Earth, and made First Contact with the human race. \n-- Humanity turns the corner. First Contact with an alien civilization brings the planet together as never before. Humans and Vulcans working together, beginning to solve long-standing problems with new technology. We see an early replicator producing food for the starving millions. A new World Government is formed. \n-- People from planet Earth and people from Vulcan form an Alliance. They call it the United Federation of Planets. And they commission a fleet of starships for protection and exploration. They call it Starfleet. \n-- These are images recounting the birth of the Star Trek universe. \nAnother muffled EXPLOSION, this one stronger, SHAKES the entire wall. One of the monitors BLOWS OUT in a shower of sparks. And now a new voice, a woman's voice, low, threatening, with a slight metallic inflection, speaks for the first time: \nWOMAN'S VOICE Stop search. Calculate temporal coordinates. J-Fourteen. \nAnother explosion ROCKS the room and it takes us to: \n4   EXT. SPACE - A BORG SPHERE                                   4 \nA huge, spherical Borg warship as it takes a phaser shot from an unseen vessel. The BLAST smashes into the Borg Sphere, but the massive ship continues. The Sphere returns FIRE. FOLLOW the Borg fire to -- \n5   A FEDERATION STARSHIP                                        5 \nlocked in battle with the Borg Sphere. The Borg fire DESTROYS the Federation ship in a fiery blast. \n6   NEW ANGLE                                                    6 \nas the Borg Sphere flies away from the wreckage of the decimated starship, and as it does, we reveal that this is just one small part of -- \n7   A MASSIVE SPACE BATTLE                                       7 \ninvolving dozens of Starfleet and Borg vessels, engaged in a fierce FIREFIGHT as far as the eye can see. Ships turning, twisting, firing, exploding. Lots of movement. It's a spectacular sight. \nThe Borg Sphere is moving away from the battle, heading off in another direction. \n8   NEW ANGLE                                                    8 \nIn the middle of the battle. A BORG CUBE is attacking a smaller Federation starship. The starship is taking quite a beating... explosions all along the hull... it doesn't look like it can take much  more of this. \nSuddenly a spread of FOUR TORPEDOES come blazing in from O.C. The torpedoes SLAM into the Borg ship, causing massive damage. \n9   THE USS ENTERPRISE NCC 1701-E                                9 \nSOARS into view and moves to protect the beleaguered starship. \nThe Enterprise is Starfleet's newest and most powerful vessel. An elegant and majestic ship. But unlike the last Enterprise, Starfleet has opted for a more muscular vessel and the hull is studded with weapons and other defensive armory. We get the feeling this Enterprise is ready for anything. \n10   INT. ENTERPRISE-E - BRIDGE                                  10 \nThe Bridge has been redesigned. A single Captain's chair dominates the room, and surrounding consoles and stations all face inward instead of out, giving Picard instant access to his officers. PICARD in the Captain's chair. RIKER at a new Ops station. DATA at the helm. WORF at Tactical. TROI at Communications, various CREWMEMBERS at their posts. The ship is at Red Alert and everyone is tense. \n", "test1_true": "TROI Aye, sir. \nShe works her console. \n11   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE & BORG SHIP                     11 \nThe Endeavor moves off as the Borg FIRE at the Enterprise and BLASTS the saucer section. This should also produce an unusual effect -- instead of the traditional \"bubble\" shielding, the new armor of this Enterprise ABSORBS the blast and dissipates the energy across the hull. The ship is undamaged. \n12   INT. BRIDGE                                                 12 \nThe ship is ROCKED by the blast. \nDATA Dispersive armor is holding. \nPICARD Bring us about. Target Borg ship alpha four, port side battery. \nWORF Port battery, ready sir! \nPICARD Fire. \n13   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                 13 \nAs RAPID PHASER SHOTS leap out from half a dozen points along the ship's port side. (NOTE: The phasers also look different, more along the lines of a gatling gun). The Borg Cube EXPLODES. The Enterprise flies through the debris. \n14   INT. BRIDGE                                                 14 \nIncluding MAIN VIEWSCREEN, which has a view of the chaotic battle surrounding them. Another Borg vessel looms into view. \nPICARD Starboard battery -- fire. \n15   EXT. SPACE                                                  15 \nThe Enterprise fires a burst of phasers -- but this time, the phasers have no effect. We see a strange SHIELDING appears around the Borg ship. \n16   INT. BRIDGE                                                 16 \nOn the main viewer, the massive Borg ship looms closer. \nDATA The Borg ship has modified its shields, Captain. Our phasers will no longer be effective. \nPICARD Ready quantum torpedo. \nWORF Aye, sir. Only three left. \nAnother JOLT as we're hit. \nGEORDI'S COM VOICE La Forge to bridge. \nPICARD Go ahead. \nINTERCUT: \n17   INT. MAIN ENGINEERING                                       17 \nWhere GEORDI and N.D. Engineers are rushing about, hard at work. Geordi is no longer wearing his VISOR -- he now has artificial ocular implants for eyes. They have a distinctive electronic look to them. \nGEORDI Captain, I'm starting to worry about the hull integrity. We've been running the support field at full power for three hours straight. I don't know how much longer it's going to hold up. \nPICARD Understood. Keep me informed. \nEND INTERCUT: \n18   INT. BRIDGE                                                 18 \nThe Borg cube is huge on the main viewer as the Enterprise rushes toward it. \nTROI Incoming transmission from the Borg. \nPICARD On screen. \nData works and the viewer changes to a view of the INTERIOR of the BORG CUBE. A vast CHAMBER crammed with HUNDREDS of BORG DRONES standing upright in individual alcoves. They're everywhere -- on the ceiling, walls, floor. This is a BORG COLLECTIVE -- hundreds of Borg that form a gigantic \"hive\" mind. The Borg are half- man/half machine. No individual personalities. No feelings. They have only one goal in life: to assimilate new races into their collective. To become a Borg is to experience living death. When they speak, they speak as a collective -- thousands of voices speaking as one: \nBORG Your defense perimeter is useless. You will be assimilated. \nPICARD (to Borg) Break off your attack. By now, you must realize you can't win... \nBORG Your opinion is irrelevant. We are the Borg. Resistance is futile. \nPICARD We'll see about that... (to Worf) Fire. \nWorf works. \n19   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE - CLOSE ON TORPEDO BAY          19 \n", "test1_id": 1134, "test2_input": "COCHRANE Let me get this straight... you're from the future... I'm about to change history... and all I have to do is sit here and let you fly my ship? \n145   WIDER                                                      145 \nPicard, Geordi and Beverly are standing around Cochrane, who is sitting in a high-backed chair in a corner of the Control Room. \nPICARD That's right. \nHe studies their faces -- sees they're serious. He smiles a little ruefully. \nCOCHRANE And people say I'm crazy... \nPicard smiles. \nPICARD I assure you, Doctor, that after today... no one will ever call you that again. \nCochrane considers them...finally nods, what the hell. \nCOCHRANE Just do me a favor... bring my ship back in one piece. \nPICARD That's a promise. \nPicard turns and walks off with Beverly. Geordi moves to Cochrane with a little bit of awe. \nGEORDI Doctor... my name is Geordi La Forge. I'm an engineer. Can I shake your hand? \nCochrane is touched by Geordi's obvious respect. They shake hands. \nCOCHRANE I wish I could go with you. Is there anything I can do to help? \nGEORDI Not really... but I do have about a thousand questions I've always wanted to ask you. \nCOCHRANE Since time is short... why don't you pick the top ten and fire away? \nGeordi smiles... \n146   PICARD AND BEVERLY                                         146 \nhave moved to another part of the room. Beverly looks exhausted. She sets her medkit on a table and plops down into a chair. Mid-conversation. \nPICARD (surprised) You actually performed surgery...? \nBEVERLY It was an experience. Metal scalpels... needle and thread... \nShe looks up with a smile, pulls a small DEVICE out of the medkit -- a surgical transporter. \nBEVERLY (re: device) But I had a little help. Surgical transporter. I used it to beam out most of the bone fragments from his brain. \nPICARD How did Doctor Almack react to that? \nBEVERLY He was so confused by what I was doing, I don't think he even noticed. (beat) Any word from the Enterprise? \nPICARD Not yet. \nBEVERLY You think they're still up there? \nPICARD (wry) If they're not... we'd better get used to living in Montana. \nBEVERLY (light) That might not be so bad... at least for you. \nShe's kidding, but Picard is a little defensive. \nPICARD What's that supposed to mean? \nThere is no animosity or hint of jealousy in Beverly's attitude, she's simply making an observation about someone she cares about. \nBEVERLY I saw the way you looker at her... and I know that look. \nPicard doesn't want to argue about this -- to him, it's a pointless conversation. \nPICARD Regardless of how I may feel about Ruby... our fates lie along different paths. Nothing can change that. \nBEVERLY You want some advice? Don't do this again. (off his look) You know exactly what I mean. \nPICARD Beverly, there were many reasons why you and I... \nBEVERLY I'd call them excuses. And the first excuse on both our lists was our \"sense of duty.\" We convinced ourselves that it was more important than anything else. And you know what? It's not. \nShe holds his look for a moment. \nPICARD (neutral) I have a ship to launch. \nPicard turns and leaves. Beverly watches him go... wondering whether her words had any affect... \n147   EXT.

Only a few feet away is the large picture of Picard. She doesn't want to look at him, doesn't want to think about him... but there he is. \nShe glances back at the open door... struggles for a moment... then makes a decision. \nDespite herself, she can't get Picard out of her head. With a little frustration, she grabs her camera bag and heads for the door... \n149   EXT. SPACE - THE ENTERPRISE                                149 \nin Earth orbit. \n150   INT.

She speaks directly to the camera. \nBORG QUEEN How do you feel? \n151   CLOSE ON DATA'S HAND                                       151 \nHis right hand is made of FLESH -- it has color, fingernails, hair, sweat. It's completely human in every way. His fingers move slightly, and then the hand begins to rise. We follow his hand as it comes up and touches his FACE, which is also FLESH. The gold color is gone, his hair is tousled and natural-looking. Even his eyes are real now -- blue. He touches his face tentatively, his expression confused... but intrigued. \nDATA Different. \nThe Borg Queen descends closer. Data's arms are now free, but he is still restrained on the table. The rest of his body is still android, mechanical. \nData touches his two hands together, feeling the sensations, flesh against machine. He touches his face and lips, discovering himself in a totally new way. \nDATA My internal sensors tell me the ambient temperature in the room is ten point two degrees Celsius... (wondrous) But my skin tells me it is cold. \nAs he talks, we can see that he's becoming seduced by his own newfound senses. \nDATA My visual acuity has been reduced by seventy-eight percent... and I can no longer perceive light beyond the ultraviolet or the infrared... (beat) But I can see. \nIt's an amazing moment, Data riding a wave of feeling and emotion like he's never had before. The Borg Queen watches, pleased. She hovers close to him. \nBORG QUEEN Until today... your emotions were trapped inside an artificial shell. You didn't know what it was to truly feel. (beat) And there's so much more for you to experience.  I will guide you into a world of sensation unlike anything you can imagine. (beat) All you have to do... is give us access to your neural net. \nData looks at her, suddenly shocked back into reality. \nDATA No. I will not betray my friends. \nBORG QUEEN They're not your friends... they've held you back... kept you from your destiny... \nDATA That is not true. They have tried to help me. \nBORG QUEEN Have they given you what I have given you? Did they even try? \nDATA I... do not want this... \nBut his words have a certain hollow quality to them. He is no longer as convinced as he was before and the Borg Queen notes this immediately. She reaches out with a hand and gently strokes Data's cheek. \nBORG QUEEN You're becoming more human all the time, Data. Now you're learning how to lie. \nDATA I wish to... go back to the way I was. \nBORG QUEEN More lies. \nShe SLAPS him hard across the face. Data feels the pain, the shock. A small trickle of blood comes from his mouth. He looks at her in surprise, but before he can say anything she moves forward and KISSES him on the mouth deeply and intensely. It's a disturbing and erotic moment. She pulls back. Data reels, trying to sort out the rapid succession of pleasure and pain. Her voice drops to a whisper and she moves even closer to him, face-to-face... seductive... beguiling. \nBORG QUEEN Have you ever know a woman? Do you know what it's like to feel her breath on your face... her skin against yours... flesh against flesh? \nDATA My creator did not intend for me to experience these things. \nBORG QUEEN I'm your creator now. \nShe rubs her body against his, cat-like... then pulls him to her and kisses him deeply. Off the image of their bizarre embrace... \nCUT TO: \n152   INT. BRIDGE                                                152 \nRiker, Worf, and three Security N.D.s are pulling on SPACESUITS. The suits are form-fitting, sleek, no bulky oxygen tanks. The helmets are the same -- they conform to the contours of the skull and face. \nWORF (to Riker) You will have to realign the targeting array of the quantum torpedo... and reprogram the warhead for the localized detonation. (beat) There's only one torpedo left... \nRIKER I guess I'd better get it right the first time. \nWORF (to all) The Borg will undoubtedly attack. Set phasers to rotating modulation. \nThe Security Officers check their phasers and wait as Riker and Worf finish putting on their suits. Riker straps a tool case to his suit. \nRIKER Ready? \n", "test2_id": 1135, "test3_input": "Everyone nods. Riker goes to a wall panel and activates the control. The Airlock door seen earlier OPENS.

They begin to walk out of the airlock... \n154   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE - AIRLOCK                          154 \nAs Riker and his team come out of the airlock on the top of the saucer section. It's a spectacular sight as the small group of figures, with weapons at the ready, marches toward the leading edge of the saucer. The scene is lit by light reflected by the Earth, which hangs above the ship. \n155   ON RIKER & WORF                                            155 \nAs they approach the edge. Worf gives a hand signal and the rest of the team spreads out into a tactical deployment and drops down onto their bellies. They crawl up to the very edge of the saucer and pause. Worf looks at Riker, who looks a little queasy. \nWORF (to Riker) Are you alright? \nRIKER Just a little queasy... \nWORF Try not to look at the stars... keep your eyes on the ship. \nRIKER Right. \nWORF And Commander, whatever you do... do not vomit in your exo-suit. It would be... unpleasant. \nRIKER I'll keep that in mind. \nRiker takes a few deep breaths to steady himself. \nRIKER (to all) Over and under! \nThey all quickly scramble over the edge and onto the underside of the saucer. \nThe CAMERA ROTATES AND SPINS with them as they traverse to the underside of the hull -- they're upside down relative to their previous position, but there's no up or down in space and their magnetized suits hold them to the hull. \nIt's a dizzying moment as we try to orient ourselves to their new position. From this angle, the Enterprise appears to be upside down! \nOnce they're on the underside of the saucer, they can see the rest of the ship laid out above them. \n156   NEW ANGLE - THEIR POV                                      156 \nThe deflector dish (which is now above us) is covered with dozens of Borg drones, who are working to modify it. Some of them turn and see us. \n157   RIKER AND WORF                                             157 \nBegin running toward the torpedo tube on the saucer. (Running is difficult, they must keep one foot on the hull at all times.) Several Borg PHASER SHOTS whip past them as the Borg open fire. \n158   THE BORG                                                   158 \nA DOZEN of them leave the work on the dish and begin skittering down (which is normally up) the interconnecting dorsal on all fours toward our heroes like a swarm of ants -- a frightening sight. \n159   A SECURITY GUARD                                           159 \nIs HIT by a phaser shot and goes FLYING OFF into space. \n160   THE TORPEDO TUBE                                           160 \nRiker reaches the opening to the torpedo tube, bends down and opens the hatch. Borg phaser shots hitting all around him. The open hatch cover provides some protection from the Borg fire. \nRIKER Worf! I'm going to need at least five minutes! \nWORF Understood! \nWorf and his team lie down on the hull and begin exchanging fire with the approaching mass of Borg. \nThey pick off a few Borg, who also go FLYING into space.

Lange goes to the monitor seen earlier, hits a switch -- the monitor comes alive, shows that Ruby is now standing outside at the hatch. Lange reacts in surprise. \nPicard and Geordi working the controls, watching the readings, etc. We hear Lange's com voice: \nLANGE'S COM VOICE Phoenix, we have a problem out here. There's a woman at the outer hatch... says her name's Ruby Sloan and she wants to see the Captain. \nPicard and Geordi react -- her timing is pretty bad. \nLANGE'S COM VOICE What do you want me to do, sir? \nGEORDI We can't let her in... she'll see Cochrane isn't making the flight. \nPICARD We can't leave her out there. When the ship launches... she'll be killed. \nGEORDI Tell her to go back to Resurrection. \nPICARD She's a very... determined woman. (to com) Phoenix to control.

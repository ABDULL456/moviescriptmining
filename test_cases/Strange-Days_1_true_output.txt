TRAN You come to peddle me some tapes, Lenny?  For old time's sake?  Make a couple bucks for the holidays? 
LENNY You're not a client anymore, Tran. I wouldn't sell you the sweat off a dead dog's balls. 
TRAN (glancing at Faith, back at Lenny) I already got everything I need from you. 
FAITH Cut it out, Tran. 
LENNY Too bad about your guy Jeriko. Tough break. 
TRAN Show a little respect, Nero.  The man was an important artist. 
LENNY Yeah, important for your label. Which no doubt is why you're in mourning.  Don't worry, his records'll sell out now he's dead. You'll make out. 
TRAN I always do. 
LENNY Faith, can I talk to you a second? 
FAITH I don't think that's a good idea, Lenny. 
LENNY I just got to talk to you for one second. 
TRAN About what? 
LENNY That would be between me and Faith, wouldn't it? 
Tran takes one of his beautiful hands and passes it slowly in the general area between his table and Lenny. 
TRAN I don't feel anything between you. See, your trouble is you assume too much, Lenny.  You assume there's something where there's nothing. You assume you have a life.  But you're only hustling pieces of other lives on tape, and broken parts of your own. 
Faith glances at Tran, then cuts her eyes to Lenny. 
FAITH (icy) We have nothing to talk about, Lenny. 
TRAN Joey, make sure Mr. Nero gets safely to his car. 
Joey smirks, glances at Beemer who rises like a wall. 
LENNY Faith, call me, okay? 
FAITH No, Lenny. 
Wade gets Lenny in a wrist-grip come along hold and starts him moving.  She looks at him -- slowly, gaze unwavering. As Beemer ushers Lenny through the crowd, Tick greets him coming the other way. 
LENNY Tick, listen, I can't stop right now.  but I'll call you tomorrow about that thing we were talking about. 
He's working the room even as he's getting dragged outside. 
TRAN Lenny the loser.  Panhandler of stolen dreams. 
FAITH Leave him alone, Tran. 
TRAN He's no concern of mine, as long as you don't talk to him.  Don't talk to anybody.  You understand?  Not with everything that's going on right now. 
FAITH You're too goddamned paranoid. 
TRAN Paranoia's only reality on a finer scale. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  RETINAL FETISH 
Beemer deposits Lenny on the curb and goes back inside. 
A SMALL CROWD of people enters the club.  Lenny brushes off his jacket, falls into step at the rear of the entering crowd. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  RETINAL FETISH 
Lenny climbs to a landing overlooking the dance floor. Through chain link he sees a swirl of activity below.  And one face, looking up at him.  Kind of casual.  Lenny clocks the guy: cop instincts coming out.  Decides he doesn't know him.  But we do.  It's Spreg.  Lenny walks on, crosses to a door, and enters... 
CUT TO: 
INT.  VJ BOOTH/RETINAL FETISH 
A tiny room overlooking the dance floor.  Crammed with electronic gear, at the center of which is Tex Arcana, whipping from one deck to another, hands flying.  He's in a wheelchair, which pivots nimbly, managing to high-five Lenny as he walks in. 
LENNY So, those rascals still haven't grown back yet, huh? 
TEX (peering under the blanket on his lap) Nope.  Guess not.  Any day now, though. 
LENNY (handing Tex a Squid) Present.  Something I had made.  Let me know what you think. 
TEX Hey, alright.  Got something here for you, too. (passes him an envelope) It just showed up tonight, don't know who left it. 
LENNY Fan mail from some flounder?

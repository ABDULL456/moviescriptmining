EXT - TRAIN STATION, TUCSON - NIGHT 
A train pours steam onto the platform in puffs and clouds while 2 porters load Morgan's coffin into a boxcar.  Up ahead, Mattie and Louisa fumble with luggage while Allie boosts Virgil into a passenger car.  As we HEAR the conductor's voice shouting, " 'Board!", Ike and Stillwell emerge from the shadows near the scales, crouched behind shotguns.  They exchange nods and start forward, cocking their weapons, squinting through the steam: 
STILLWELL That's Virgil with the women.  But Where the hell's Wyatt? 
O.S. VOICE Right behind you, Stillwell. 
They spin around.  Wyatt stands behind them, looking down the barrels of Virgil's big 10 gauge.  Stillwell raises his shotgun, Wyatt FIRES.  Stillwell hits the floor in a crumpled heap, his torso a smoking bundle of bloody rags.  Screams Page 87 cut off right side Page 88 missing 
WAGONMASTER Rest of us're 3 months out of Independece but we're from Carthage, Illinois originally. 
WYATT Carthage, really?  I'm from Monmouth. 
WAGONMASTER Another Illinois man!  Practical Neighbors!  Step down, Marshal. Have a feed. 
EXT - WAGON TRAIN CAMP - NIGHT 
Lucinda's ever-silent son sits at a nearby wagon, staring at Wyatt while Lucinda rolls dough, lovely as ever.  Just finished telling his story, Wyatt sits by the fire with the wagonmaster and several others.  They shaker their head: 
WAGONMASTER Ain't got law, ain't got nothin'. Only thing between us and the Animals.  Always the way it goes, Though.  Only way to down an Illinois man's from behind, the Dogs don't dare face 'em.  Mr. Lincoln, Wild Bill, now your Brothers:  Illinois men all and All downed from behind by dirty Dogs and Democrats.  Guess an Ordinary man'd be out for Vengeance but I don't figure That'll answer here.  It's a Reckoning you're after. 
WYATT If the Lord is my friend. 
WAGONMASTER Let not your heart be faint, let Your arm be steel-that's all you Need of the Lord. 
Wyatt pauses, nodding, suddenly understanding the truth of it. Looking up, his eyes meet those of Lucinda.  She smiles, wiping flour from her hands.  Wyatt smiles thoughtfully, moved by this unexpected encounter.... 
EXT - WAGON TRAIN CAMP - MORNING 
Next morning.  Doc gallops into camp with McMasters, Texas Jack Vermillion, and Turkey Creek Jack Johnson, exchanging greetings with Wyatt who leads him over to the center of the camp, then: 
WYATT Know why you're here? 
VERMILLION Way ahead of you, Wyatt.  You want Us to help you get Ike Clanton And Johnny Behan.  Everybody knows They're the ones to blame for Your brothers. 
WYATT They're nothing.  They're nobody. I want the Cowboys.  All of 'em.  I Mean to break 'em up, drive 'em Out of the territory. 
JOHNSON Are you out of your mind?  What on Earth'd make us- 
WYATT (takes out wad of bills) I'll pay you 500 each in advance And I'll mount you on those. 
He points to his 5 magnificent blacks tied nearby.  They look them over as Wyatt takes out a stack of warrants. 
WYATT Got a sheaf of federal warrants. Being in the Territories it's up To our discretion how they're Served.  That means we got the Cowboys without quarter.  The Black flag, brother.  No Prisoners, no mercy, amen. 
VERMILLION (to Johnson) 500... Year's wages.  And I never even saw a horse like that. 
JOHNSON You crazy?  It can't be done. 
MCMASTERS It might be done.  If we hit the Waterholes through the southern Dragoons, the Whetstones and Huachucas, we could take 'em on In pieces, run off their herds. (faces Wyatt) Keep your money, I'll show you Where those waterholes are.  Just Promise me you'll finish it.  No Matter what happens you'll see it Through to the end.  I'll have Your hand on that. 
They shake.   Vermillion and Johnson confer in whispers, then: 
VERMILLION We come through this in one Piece, can we keep the horses? 
Wyatt nods.  Vermillion nods to Johnson who crouches down with a pair of dice.  He makes one pass, two passes... Finally: 
JOHNSON Crapped out.  Okay, we're in. 
EXP - WAGON TRAIN CAMP/DESERT - DAY 
The thoroughbreds are saddled and waiting, each with a rifle in a scabbard and a double-barreled shotgun across the saddle fork.  Lucinda's son looks on with gathering awe as Wyatt's men, each carrying 2 pistols, face their boss. 
WYATT The minute we start we'll be Going against local and county Law.  If we fail the U.S. Government won't be able to lift A finger to help us.  Nevertheless I want you to understand we carry The full force and authority of The law of this land. 
They exchange glances, each man feeling a little shiver at the magnitude of what they're about to attempt.  Wyatt faces them: 
WYATT Raise your right hands.  Do you Solemnly swear to uphold the laws And constitution of the United States of America and to protect her citizens to the best of your Ability, even at the cost of your Own life? 
All chorus, "I do", except for Doc who rolls his eyes. Finally: 
DOC Oh... All right. 
Wyatt hands each a Federal Deputy's badges.  Doc waves his away: 
DOC You know why I'm here.  My Hypocrisy only goes so far. 
Wyatt shrugs.  They mount up, about to begin, but suddenly: 
LUCINDA Wait! 
Lucinda runs up to Wyatt, reaching up and tying a blue and gold silk scarf around his neck.

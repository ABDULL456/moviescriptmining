Mini leads him in. 
MINI (V.O.) I know, it's stupid as hell to talk to a cop without a lawyer, but I didn't want to look jumpy and my first real interrogation? I could feel something tingle deep inside. 
Mini and Garson take a seat. Mini lights a cigarette. Garson looks over her outfit again. 
GARSON It's a little early for the prom, isn't it? 
MINI A girl can dream, can't she? 
GARSON Perfectly legal. So, anyway, we got the preliminary coroner's report. Although the pills knocked her out, she died of the carbon monoxide poisoning from the exhaust. 
MINI Is it that important? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
GARSON Well, it's just a little unusual for a suicide victim to use two methods. Her choices seemed, I don't know how to put it... improvisational. 
MINI Well, maybe she wanted to drift off before the fumes got her? She clearly put some thought into that outfit. 
GARSON Clearly...But dying from carbon monoxide poisoning is actually pretty painless, you just basically pass out. 
MINI I doubt she would have had an intimate knowledge of how car fumes feel when you choke on them. 
GARSON I suppose you're right...Also we checked the phone records and there was a 911 call placed at 8:12. It was a hang up and when the 911 dispatcher called back a few minutes later, there was no answer. 
MINI Really? 
GARSON Any idea why she'd call 911? 
MINI (V.O.) Okie fine, this may be the most exciting thing I've done in a while, but even I know when the rush isn't worth the risk. 
MINI Look, I think you should come back when my father's around. He'll be upset I let a stranger in the house.    G ARSON I think you're safe with me. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
MINI Even so, he won't be happy. 
GARSON Not a problem, will he be home tonight? 
INT. MARTIN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Martin is on the phone. 
MARTIN And you let him in?! 
EXT. THE POOL - CONTINUOUS 
Mini lounges in a bikini, talking on the cordless phone, while sucking on a red popsicle. 
MINI I played it cool, it would've looked worse to be defensive. 
Mini looks across the yard to see... 
MIKE RUDELL looking down at her from the upstairs balcony of his home. He's dressed in a plush terry cloth robe and is smoking a pipe, which he raises in greeting. His eyes are locked on hers. 
MARTIN (V.O.) Well, when's he coming over? 
MINI Tonight? 
MARTIN (V.O.) Tonight!? I've got a dinner with Chapman. I've already cancelled-- (frustrated) Damn it! Why didn't you call me?! 
RUDELL allows the folds of his robe to open in the breeze, revealing his chest and pair of silk boxers. He's in good shape for a man his age. 
MINI (annoyed) Hey, I didn't know you had plans! 
Mini responds to Rudell's challenge, lowering a strap on her bikini top. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARTIN (V.O.) Listen, I'll be home early so we can get the story straight. 
MINI Okay. 
Mini hangs up the phone, removing the popsicle slowly from her mouth. 
INT. THE LIVING ROOM - EVENING 
Martin and Mini sit across from Garson. Martin appears cool and relaxed, a scotch in his hand. 
GARSON I really appreciate you taking the time to help us out. There's just a few loose ends we want to tie up. 
MARTIN Absolutely. What would you like to know? 
Garson opens his briefcase and removes a report. He starts G leafing through papers. 
ARSON There appears to be some question as to the time of death. You said you went to dinner and a movie-

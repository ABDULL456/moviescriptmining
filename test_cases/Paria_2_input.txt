I'ma look his ass up in the system. Ha-ha! Wait `till your mama finds out. She'll be so goddamn happy. 
Alike plays along, swallowing her disappointment. 
ALIKE Yeah. 
Arthur pushes back from the table and pulls a fresh police uniform out the hall closet. He lays it across the back of the couch and unzips his pants. Alike turns her back to give him privacy. 
ARTHUR Say uh--there's this new--uh women's club up there by the liquor store--have you--do you--you haven't heard anything about it, right? 
Alike shakes her head no. Arthur tucks his undershirt into his pants. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Called the Kitty Litter, the Catbox, something like that? 
ALIKE Nah, I never even heard of it. 
ARTHUR Good. `Cause you know that's a uh...it's a rough neighborhood. You know that right? I had a case over there. You wanna be careful--stay away from that element. Just in case it ever comes up? 
ALIKE I'll be careful. 
ARTHUR Good. I know you will. 
Alike glances back at Arthur and sees that he's decent. She scoots back around to face him. Arthur smooths his uniform shirt into his pants. 
ALIKE Dad, when you were on the phone earlier? It sounded like...I mean...I guess you're headed back to work, huh? 
ARTHUR Yep. Your mama still up? 
ALIKE Probably. 
ARTHUR Tell her I had to work. 
Arthur picks up his work tote and kisses Alike on the forehead. 
ARTHUR (CONT'D) Love you. 
56   INT. LAURA'S KITCHEN - MORNING                            56 
Laura jams a pillow into a t-shirt as a makeshift pillowcase as she escorts one of the pier girls to the couch. The pier girl looks slightly unkempt and is relieved to plop her knapsack on the floor. Laura tosses the pillow onto the couch. 
LAURA My sister gets home at six so, you gotta be gone by then. 
PIER GIRL #2 Good looking. 
LAURA There's some lunchmeat in there too, help yourself. 
PIER GIRL #2 `Preciate ya. 
Laura pulls up close to the kitchen table. The GED test prep book, now dog-eared and worn is on the table in front of her. 
She finds her place and copies notes and multiple choice answers into a spiral notebook. A stack of old Math and English textbooks are in a chair next to her and the room is peaceful and still save for the scratching of her pencil. 
57   INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - AFTERNOON                           57 
Alike spies on Bina stuffing books into her locker. She draws her breath and approaches. 
ALIKE Hey. 
BINA Hey. 
A long awkward silence. Alike leans against the bank of lockers, not daring to make eye contact. 
ALIKE I'm sorry about the other day. 
BINA It's cool. 
Bina pretends to rearrange books in her locker. 
ALIKE (CONT'D) Things have been crazy. But look, I'm sorry I bugged out. It's just...I didn't know that you...I wasn't expecting that. 
BINA You still coming to the party? 
ALIKE I don't know--I need to try and catch up with Laura.

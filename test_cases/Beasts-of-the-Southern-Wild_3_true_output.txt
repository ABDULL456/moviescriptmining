Wink uses a pole to open a door. 
WINK Yo Winston? 
No one answers. They push off. 
EXT. EDISON'S HOUSE - FLOODED - THE TURCK - DAY 
Wink enters an intact house with water up to the porch. 
WINK (O.S.) Edison? Ow-Wee! 
Wink leans against the door frame. From his POV we see Hushpuppy on the Turck. She picks a leaf and eats it. Wink shakes his head in dismay, realizing all too clearly his girl is not ready for survival. 
EXT. SWAMP - THE TURCK - DAY 
The Turck passes through a net of Spanish moss into the belly of a swamp. 
WINK Some day when I'm gone, you gonna be the last man in the bathtub. You have to learn how to feed your house. 
Wink goes to the edge of the turck and sticks his hand in the water. 
WINK (CONT'D) Now, stick your left hand in this water, stick it in there. 
Hushpuppy puts her right hand in the water. 
WINK (CONT'D) Ok, what you do is you hold your hand steady and you just wait for your fish to come. You gotta ball your fist up, this is your punching hand. Ball your fist up in case you have to whack it when they come up. 
Wink pulls a Catfish out with his bare hand. 
WINK (CONT'D) WHOOOOO YEA! Whooo lord, look what we got. I gotcha. Say "I gotcha!" 
HUSHPUPPY I gotcha! 
Wink slams the fish down on the floor of the Turck and pins it. 
WINK Yea! Hold him down! Now, you hold it down like this, and whack him good with your fist. 
Wink pins the fish and punches it in the face. 
WINK (CONT'D) Go ahead whack him! You whack him good. Hold him like that and whack him! 
Hushpuppy pins the fish. She tries to whack it and it cuts her. 
HUSHPUPPY OW! 
She hides her cut hand from Wink. 
WINK You OK? That's all a part of it. 
Hushpuppy winces in pain. 
WINK (CONT'D) You wanna try it again? 
Hushpuppy shakes her head no, trying not to cry.

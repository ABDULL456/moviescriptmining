REESE (continuing) ...but there was one man...who taught us to fight.  To storm the wire of the camps.  To smash those metal mother- fuckers into junk.  He turned it around...he brought us back from the brink. (pause) His name is Connor.  John Connor... your son, Sarah.  Your unborn son. 
Sarah stared at him.

The brown Buick is F.G. as the nose of Terminator's cruiser appears behind it, moving slowly. 
C.U. - TERMINATOR, scanning. 
LOW ANGLE, past the back of the Buick, as Terminator cruises by.  The tailpipe, F.G., puffs quietly. Terminator's head snaps around. His eyes lock on Reese's car. He reaches for his shotgun.

Reese and Terminator race along opposite sides of a row of cars, approaching the exit. The cruiser pulls ahead and closes diagonally as they clear the last car. Reese sees the other's shotgun leveled. He ducks, steering blind, keeps it floored. The windshield and side window EXPLODES INWARD. 
The Buick slams into the black-and-white, spinning it into a parked truck.  TIRES SCREAM as the two cars slew around heading for the exit. 
SEVERAL ANGLES, as the police react. 
The chopper banks tight and dives across the tops of the parked cars.  Cruisers race to converge.

LOW WIDE ANGLE, PRECEDING REESE'S BUICK as it hits the street, accelerating.  Terminator's cruiser slides out behind it, fishtails, races forward. Engines roar as the cars go flat out.  Buildings lining the street become a blur. The chopper arcs in behind them. Legitimate police, lights blazing, enter the pursuit one by one. 
LOW ANGLE, MOVING WITH TERMINATOR'S CAR as Reese dodges across all lanes ahead of it. Terminator gaining. They run an intersection at a hundred plus.

Reese is feeding his last two shells into the riot gun. 
REESE (yelling) Steer! 
Holding the gun is both hands he leans out the window, still keeping the throttle mashed down. Sarah grabs the wheel, fighting to control the car.

MOVING WITH THE BUICK, looking back, as Reese aims the shotgun, buffeted by the windstream. Terminator's car, B.G., overtakes rapidly. 
SARAH (shouting) Reese!

MOVING WITH BOTH CARS as the Buick skids with rear tires locked.  Reese and Terminator FIRE simultaneously. 
TIGHT ON REESE as the doorpost next to his shoulder is torn out by the other's blast.

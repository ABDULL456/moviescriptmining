DERELICT HOUSE - DAY <>\t1 \nA POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH, clasped between finger and thumb: a crude, crime scene flash picture of a MAN'S BODY lying on a decaying wooden floor, a BLOODY MESS where his head should be. \nThe image in the photo starts to FADE as we SUPER TITLES. The hand holding the photo suddenly FANS it in a rapid FLAPPING motion, then holds it still. The image fades more, and again the picture is FANNED. \nAs TITLES END the image fades to nothing. The hand holding the photo FLAPS it again, then places it at the front of a POLAROID CAMERA. \nThe camera SUCKS the blank picture up, then the FLASH BURSTS. \nThe Polaroid camera is lowered, revealing the sweaty, heavy- breathing face of LEONARD (mid-30's). There are droplets of blood across his face. Leonard stares, satisfied, at something on the ground in front of him. There is WET BLOOD on his BLUE SHIRT and BEIGE SUIT. His hand opens and catches a HANDGUN which leaps up into his grasp. \nStill staring, he crouches down and pulls a BODY off the floor by the wet hair of its BLOODY HEAD. He slowly inserts the barrel of the gun into the bloody mess where the mouth should be. \nLeonard FLINCHES.

DERELICT BUILDING - DAY <>\t\t   3 \nA late model Jaguar bumps across some railroad tracks and approaches a large, clearly abandoned DERELICT BUILDING. Leonard is driving. He wears a BEIGE SUIT and BLUE SHIRT (no blood). Next to him is TEDDY. Leonard stops the car next to a PICKUP TRUCK sitting Outside the derelict building. Leonard kills the engine, staring at the pickup. \nLEONARD Looks like somebody's home. \nTeddy looks from Leonard to the pickup and back. \nTEDDY That thing's been here for years. \nLeonard gets out of the Jaguar and moves to the pickup. He inspects it with a methodical, practiced eye. Teddy follows. \nLEONARD I think you're wrong. These tracks aren't\t* more than a few days old. \nLeonard opens the door of the pickup and searches the interior. On the dirty vinyl of the passenger seat he finds\t* six BULLETS. Leonard picks two of them up and studies them.\t* He drops them onto the dashboard then SHUTS the door.\t\t* \nLEONARD (cont'd) Let's take a look inside. \nLeonard walks towards the house, patting his jacket pockets. Teddy leans on the pickup, uneasy, watching Leonard. \n4    INT. DERELICT BUILDING - DAY <>\t\t\t4 \nLeonard stands in the dimly-lit, decaying former hallway. He pulls a stack of POLAROID PHOTOGRAPHS out of his pocket and leafs through them as Teddy starts walking towards him. \nLeonard finds a photo showing Teddy with a shit-eating grin standing in front of the pickup truck. On the broad white strip beneath the photo is handwritten: \n\"TEDDY GAMMELL TEL. 555 0134\" \nLeonard flips the photo over.

Teddy enters, wary. \nTEDDY Find anything? Didn't think so, let's go, yeah? \nLeonard neither replies nor turns around. Teddy, worried, affects a casual air, shrugging dismissively, \nTEDDY (cont'd) Fuck this. \nTeddy turns and heads for the door. Leonard LEAPS on him, pistol-whipping him furiously as he shouts: \nLEONARD YOU PAY FOR WHAT YOU DID! YOU BEG FORGIVENESS, THEN YOU PAY! \nTeddy is down. Leonard DRAGS him back, deeper into the dark house. Leonard is in a frenzy. He dumps Teddy at the end of the hall and stands over him. Teddy SPITS BLOOD. \nTEDDY You don't have a clue, you freak. \nLeonard crouches down and grabs Teddy by the lapels. \nLEONARD Beg my forgiveness!

I have this condition. \nBURT Condition? \nLEONARD I have no memory. \nBURT Amnesia? \nLEONARD No. It's different. I have no short-term memory. I know who I am and all about myself, but since my injury I can't make any new memories. Everything fades. If we talk for too long, I'll forget how we started. I don't know if we've ever met before, and the next time I see you I won't remember this conversation.

Jump cuts of details: a smile, eating, tucking her hair behind her ear, pulling on a pair of trousers, watching TV, shouting in anger. Sitting on the edge of the bed in her underwear, she TURNS as Leonard pinches her thigh. \nLEONARD (V.O.) You can only feel details. Bits and pieces which you didn't bother to put into words. And extreme moments you feel even if you don't want to. Put it together and you get the feel of the person, enough to know how much you miss them, and how much you hate the person who took them away. \n26   INT. CITY GRILL - DAY - <>\t\t\t   26 \nLeonard opens his eyes. Natalie is looking at him. She nods and hands him the BROWN ENVELOPE. \nNATALIE I wrote an address in there, too. Might be useful. It's this abandoned place outside of town. I guy I know used to use it for his bigger deals. \nLEONARD Deals? \nNATALIE It's isolated. \nLEONARD Sounds perfect?

Take care, Leonard. \nLeonard watches Natalie leave. He sits at the table, looking down at the BROWN ENVELOPE and the MOTEL ROOM KEY (ROOM 304). Leonard rises, and heads to the restroom. \n27   INT. RESTAURANT RESTROOM - DAY <>\t\t 27 \nLeonard flushes the urinal, then moves to the sink and starts washing his hands. He notices a MESSAGE written on the back of his hand: \n\"REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS\" \n27   CONTINUED:\t\t\t\t\t\t\t 27 \nHe stares at the message for a second, thoughtful, then tries to scrub the writing off his skin. To his surprise, it is INDELIBLE. Leonard looks at it, quizzical, then notices some markings on his wrists, pulling his sleeve back to get a better look. He can read the start of a message: \nLEONARD Well, at least you're being honest about cheating me. \nBURT Yeah, well you're not gonna remember, anyway. \nLEONARD You don't have to be that honest, Burt. \nBURT Leonard. \nLeonard turns. Burt grins. \nBURT (cont'd) Always get a receipt. \nLEONARD I'm gonna write that down. \nLeonard fishes a piece of paper out of his pocket. There is a message on it which he reads.

Mr Samuel R. Jankis - strangest case ever. Guy's 58, semi- retired accountant.

They were short. \nSammy rolls a small GLASS BOTTLE between the palms of his hands. Mrs. Jankis rolls up her sleeve. Leonard watches as Sammy takes a SYRINGE and pushes the needle through the rubber of the bottle. The label is marked \"INSULIN\". \nLEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd) The crazy part was that this guy who couldn't follow the plot of \"Green Acres\" could do the most complicated things as long as he had learned them before the accident... \nSammy INVERTS the bottle and syringe, DRAWS the insulin into the syringe, withdraws the needle, holds it up to check for bubbles, TAPPING it delicately. \nLEONARD (V.0.) (CONT'D) ... and as long as he kept his mind on what he was doing. \nSammy wipes a spot on Mrs. Jankis' arm with a swab, then gently PINCHES the skin and confidently INSERTS the needle.\t* Mrs Jankis winces.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t * \nMRS JANKIS\t\t\t\t\t\t    * Gentle.\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  * \nSammy looks up, worried.

The BRUISE on her eye and the MARK on her lip are worse than before. \nShe OPENS her eyes and is startled by the sight of Leonard's hovering face. \nLEONARD Sorry. It's only me. \nLeonard FLOPS down.

You know, Lenny, I've had more rewarding friendships than this one. Although I do get to keep using the same jokes. \nLeonard thinks, then moves to the CLOSET and OPENS the door. Teddy looks in DISBELIEF at the Man in the closet. \nTEDDY (cont'd) Who the fuck is that? \nLEONARD You don't know him? \nTEDDY No!

He pulls a Polaroid out of his inside jacket pocket. \nLEONARD (cont'd) Here we go. \nThe Polaroid shows Dodd sitting on the bed, BOUND, GAGGED and BLEEDING. The name Dodd is written below the picture. Leonard flips it over. On the back it says: \n\"GET RID OF HIM, THEN ASK NATALIE\" \nTeddy looks at the photo over Leonard's shoulder. \nTEDDY Natalie? Natalie who? \nLEONARD Why? \n(CONTINUED) \n69   CONTINUED: (3)\t\t\t\t\t\t\t  69 TEDDY I think I know her. \nLeonard sticks his pictures in his pocket. \nLEONARD We've got to get him out of here. \nTEDDY He's got to have a car, right?

DODD'S MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - DAY <>    76 \nLeonard sits on the toilet, grasping an empty VODKA BOTTLE by the neck. He notices the bottle in his hands as if for the first time. \nLEONARD (V.O.) Don't feel drunk. \nLeonard looks up from the VODKA BOTTLE, sighs, rubs his face, then stands up. He SNIFFS at his armpit. \nHe puts the empty bottle on the counter by the sink, then wearily UNDRESSES. \nLeonard, NAKED, looks in the mirror, then RUNS THE SHOWER then steps under it, shutting the PEBBLED PLASTIC STALL DOOR. \nLeonard SHOWERS. He turns the water off, then hears the DOOR BEING UNLOCKED. Leonard freezes, standing in the SHOWER STALL, NAKED and DRIPPING. Through the distortion of the PEBBLED PLASTIC DOOR, Leonard sees a FIGURE enter the bathroom and start pissing into the toilet. The distorted Figure turns and approaches the shower stall, becoming clearer as it gets closer, then YANKS the door open. It is Dodd (WITHOUT INJURIES). He is SHOCKED to see the naked Leonard. Leonard BURSTS out of the shower stall, SMASHING Dodd against the wall. \nDodd STRUGGLES around, grabbing at the SLIPPERY, naked Leonard. Dodd PUSHES against Leonard, SLASMMING him into the sink. \nLeonard has his arms around Dodd's neck. Leonard SMASHES Dodd's head sideways into the wall, HARD. \nDodd SLUMPS to the floor. Leonard exhales. Dodd puts a FIST in Leonard's crotch, then GRABS his neck as he doubles over. Dodd uses Leonard to pull himself off the floor then PUNCHES the side of his head and pushes him HARD, Leonard FLAILING wildly, GRABBING THE EMPTY VODKA BOTTLE from by the sink as he falls back into the bedroom. Dodd reaches into his INSIDE POCKET. \n77   INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY <>\t\t   77 \nLeonard STUMBLES in, naked, from the bathroom, swings around, HITTING Dodd square in the face with the empty vodka bottle, which does not break. \nDodd lies still on the floor, bleeding, his hand still in his inside jacket pocket. Leonard stands above him, naked, dripping wet, catching his breath. \nThere is a KNOCK at the door. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Housekeeping. \nThe sound of a KEY entering the lock. Leonard LEAPS for the door and flips the privacy latch. \nLEONARD Not just now! \nLeonard listens to the maid withdraw her key. Leonard SEARCHES Dodd, finding his GUN in his inside pocket. Leonard examines the weapon, then starts to search the room. Leonard finds an overnight bag at the bottom of the closet. Inside it there are some clothes, spare ammunition, a large hunting knife, and a roll of SILVER ELECTRICAL TAPE. \nLeonard WRAPS the electrical tape around Dodd's wrists, then across his mouth. Leonard finishes taping up Dodd, then sits him on the edge of the bed. Leonard takes a POLAROID PHOTOGRAPH of the bloody, taped-up Dodd. \nLeonard shoves Dodd into the closet, takes out a NOTE and consults it, then writes \"DODD\" on the white strip on the front of the photograph. He flips the picture over and writes on the strip on the back, in smaller writing: \n\"GET RID OF HIM, ASK NATALIE\" \nLeonard dresses, puts the Polaroid into the inside pocket of his jacket. He looks again at the note. It says: \n\"DODD, MOUNTCREST INN ON 5TH STREET, ROOM 6\"\t\t\t\t* \n\"PUT HIM ONTO TEDDY OR JUST GET RID OF HIM FOR NATALIE\" \nLeonard picks the stack of Polaroids out of his outside jacket pocket.

This is Leonard. Thanks. Bye. \nLeonard hangs up. He looks around the room. He slips the HANDGUN into the bedside drawer, resting it on the GIDEON BIBLE, then swings his feet up onto the bed and lies down. \nCUT TO: \n78   INT.

He leaves the CARD WEDGED in the lock, then steps back from the door and KNOCKS. \nLeonard watches the POINT OF LIGHT in the PEEPHOLE to Room 9. \nThe point of light GOES OUT. Leonard KICKS the door in, SMASHING THE ROOM'S OCCUPANT BACK INTO THE ROOM. \nLeonard stands over him, looking down. The man is unconscious, blood on his face. Something is not right. \nLEONARD (cont'd) They weren't even looking for John G. The stuff they found in the car just fit in with what they believed had happened, so they didn't chase any of it up. \n111  EXT.

I'm Leonard Shelby, I'm from San Fran - \nTEDDY That's who you were, Lenny. You don't know who you are, who you've become since the incident. You're wandering around, playing detective... and you don't even know how long ago it was. \nTeddy reaches out to Leonard's lapel, and gently opens his jacket to reveal the label. \nTEDDY (cont'd) Put it this way.

Leonard reads the message he has written on the back of Natalie's picture: \n\"DON'T TRUST HER\" \nHe flips Teddy's picture over, like a croupier turning a card at blackjack. On the back it says: \n\"DON'T BELIEVE HIS LIES\" \nLeonard purses his lips in surprised frustration. He grabs his pen and scribbles on the back of Natalie's picture, obliterating the words: \n\"DON'T TRUST HER\" \nHe flips Natalie's picture over and considers her blurred image.

It had got to the point where she'd get Sammy to hide food all around the house, then stop feeding him to see if his hunger would make him remember where he'd hidden the stuff. She wasn't a cruel person, she just wanted her old Sammy back. \nThe tearful Mrs. Jankis gives Leonard a determined look. \nMRS. JANKIS Mr. Shelby, you know all about Sammy and you decided that he was faking - \nLEONARD Mrs. Jankis, the company's position isn't that Sammy is \"faking\" anything, just that his condition can't be shown - \nMRS.

(cont'd) Now... where was I? \nROLL CREDITS \nEND. \nThe following is Jonathan Nolan's short story \"Memento Mori\", the inspiration for his brother, Christopher Nolan's, screenplay for the film, MEMENTO: \nMEMENTO MORI by Jonathan Nolan \nWhat like a bullet can undeceive!\" -Herman Melville \nYour wife always used to say you'd be late for your own funeral. Remember that? Her little joke because you were such a slob-always late, always forgetting stuff, even before the incident. \nRight about now you're probably wondering if you were late for hers. \nYou were there, you can be sure of that. That's what the picture's for-the one tacked to the wall by the door. It's not customary to take pictures at a funeral, but somebody, your doctors, I guess, knew you wouldn't remember. They had it blown up nice and big and stuck it right there, next to the door, so you couldn't help but see it every time you got up to find out where she was. \nThe guy in the picture, the one with the flowers? That's you. And what are you doing? You're reading the headstone, trying to figure out who's funeral you're at, same as you're reading it now, trying to figure why someone stuck that picture next to your door. But why bother reading something that you won't remember? \nShe's gone, gone for good, and you must be hurting right now, hearing the news. Believe me, I know how you feel. You're probably a wreck. But give it five minutes, maybe ten. Maybe you can even go a whole half hour before you forget. \nBut you will forget-I guarantee it. A few more minutes and you'll be heading for the door, looking for her all over again, breaking down when you find the picture. How many times do you have to hear the news before some other part of your body, other than that busted brain of yours, starts to remember? \nNever-ending grief, never-ending anger. Useless without direction. Maybe you can't understand what's happened. Can't say I really understand, either. Backwards amnesia. That's what the sign says. CRS disease. Your guess is as good as mine. \nMaybe you can't understand what happened to you. But you do remember what happened to HER, don't you? The doctors don't want to talk about it. They won't answer my questions. They don't think it's right for a man in your condition to hear about those things. But you remember enough, don't you? You remember his face. \nThis is why I'm writing to you. Futile, maybe. I don't know how many times you'll have to read this before you listen to me. I don't even know how long you've been locked up in this room already. Neither do you. But your advantage in forgetting is that you'll forget to write yourself off as a lost cause. \nSooner or later you'll want to do something about it. And when you do, you'll just have to trust me, because I'm the only one who can help you. \nEARL OPENS ONE EYE after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed. An alarm clock is ringing somewhere. He reads the sign, blinks,reads it again, then takes a look at the room. \nIt's a white room, overwhelmingly white, from the walls and the curtains to the institutional furniture and the bedspread. The alarm clock is ringing from the white desk under the window with the white curtains. At this point Earl probably notices that he is lying on top of his white comforter. He is already wearing a dressing gown and slippers. \nHe lies back and reads the sign taped to the ceiling again. It says, in crude block capitals, THIS IS YOUR ROOM. THIS IS A ROOM IN A HOSPITAL. THIS IS WHERE YOU LIVE NOW. \nEarl rises and takes a look around. The room is large for a hospital-empty linoleum stretches out from the bed in three directions. Two doors and a window. The view isn't very helpful, either-a close of trees in the center of a carefully manicured piece of turf that terminates in a sliver of two-lane blacktop. The trees, except for the evergreens, are bare-early spring or late fall, one or the other. \nEvery inch of the desk is covered with Post-it notes, legal pads, neatly printed lists, psychological textbooks, framed pictures. On top of the mess is a half-completed crossword puzzle. The alarm clock is riding a pile of folded newspapers. Earl slaps the snooze button and takes a cigarette from the pack taped to the sleeve of his dressing gown. He pats the empty pockets of his pajamas for a light. He rifles the papers on the desk, looks quickly through the drawers. Eventually he finds a box of kitchen matches taped to the wall next to the window. Another sign is taped just above the box. It says in loud yellow letters, CIGARETTE? CHECK FOR LIT ONES FIRST, STUPID. \nEarl laughs at the sign, lights his cigarette, and takes a long draw. Taped to the window in front of him is another piece of looseleaf paper headed YOUR SCHEDULE. \nIt charts off the hours, every hour, in blocks: 10:00 p.m. to 8:00 a.m. is labeled go BACK TO SLEEP. Earl consults the alarm clock: 8:15. Given the light outside, it must be morning. He checks his watch: 10:30. He presses the watch to his ear and listens. He gives the watch a wind or two and sets it to match the alarm clock. \nAccording to the schedule, the entire block from 8:00 to 8:30 has been labeled BRUSH YOUR TEETH. Earl laughs again and walks over to the bathroom. \nThe bathroom window is open. As he flaps his arms to keep warm, he notices the ashtray on the windowsill. A cigarette is perched on the ashtray, burning steadily through a long finger of ash. He frowns, extinguishes the old butt, and replaces it with the new one. \nThe toothbrush has already been treated to a smudge of white paste. The tap is of the push-button variety-a dose of water with each nudge. Earl pushes the brush into his cheek and fiddles it back and forth while he opens the medicine cabinet. The shelves are stocked with single-serving packages of vitamins, aspirin, antidiuretics. The mouthwash is also single-serving, about a shot-glass-worth of blue liquid in a sealed plastic bottle. Only the toothpaste is regular-sized. Earl spits the paste out of his mouth and replaces it with the mouthwash. As he lays the toothbrush next to the toothpaste, he notices a tiny wedge of paper pinched between the glass shelf and the steel backing of the medicine cabinet. He spits the frothy blue fluid into the sink and nudges for some more water to rinse it down. He closes the medicine cabinet and smiles at his reflection in the mirror. \n\"Who needs half an hour to brush their teeth?\" \nThe paper has been folded down to a minuscule size with all the precision of a sixth-grader's love note. Earl unfolds it and smooths it against the mirror. It reads- \nIF YOU CAN STILL READ THIS, THEN YOU'RE A FUCKING COWARD. \nEarl stares blankly at the paper, then reads it again. He turns it over. On the back it reads- \nP.S.: AFTER YOU'VE READ THIS, HIDE IT AGAIN. \nEarl reads both sides again, then folds the note back down to its original size and tucks it underneath the toothpaste. \nMaybe then he notices the scar. It begins just beneath the ear, jagged and thick, and disappears abruptly into his hairline. Earl turns his head and stares out of the corner of his eye to follow the scar's progress. He traces it with a fingertip, then looks back down at the cigarette burning in the ashtray. A thought seizes him and he spins out of the bathroom. \nHe is caught at the door to his room, one hand on the knob. Two pictures are taped to the wall by the door. Earl's attention is caught first by the MRI, a shiny black frame for four windows into someone's skull. In marker, the picture is labeled YOUR BRAIN. Earl stares at it. Concentric circles in different colors. He can make out the big orbs of his eyes and, behind these, the twin lobes of his brain. Smooth wrinkles, circles, semicircles. But right there in the middle of his head, circled in marker, tunneled in from the back of his neck like a maggot into an apricot, is something different. Deformed, broken, but unmistakable. A dark smudge, the shape of a flower, right there in the middle of his brain. \nHe bends to look at the other picture. It is a photograph of a man holding flowers, standing over a fresh grave. The man is bent over, reading the headstone. For a moment this looks like a hall of mirrors or the beginnings of a sketch of infinity: the one man bent over, looking at the smaller man, bent over, reading the headstone. Earl looks at the picture for a long time. Maybe he begins to cry. Maybe he just stares silently at the picture. Eventually, he makes his way back to the bed, flops down, seals his eyes shut, tries to sleep. \nThe cigarette burns steadily away in the bathroom. A circuit in the alarm clock counts down from ten, and it starts ringing again. \nEarl opens one eye after another to a stretch of white ceiling tiles, interrupted by a hand-printed sign taped right above his head, large enough for him to read from the bed. \nYou can't have a normal life anymore. You must know that. How can you have a girlfriend if you can't remember her name? Can't have kids, not unless you want them to grow up with a dad who doesn't recognize them. Sure as hell can't hold down a job. Not too many professions out there that value forgetfulness. Prostitution, maybe. Politics, of course. \nNo. Your life is over. You're a dead man.The only thing the doctors are hoping to do is teach you to be less of a burden to the orderlies. And they'll probably never let you go home, wherever that would be. \nSo the question is not \"to be or not to be,\" because you aren't. The question is whether you want to do something about it. Whether revenge matters to you. \nIt does to most people. For a few weeks, they plot, they scheme, they take measures to get even. But the passage of time is all it takes to erode that initial impulse. Time is theft, isn't that what they say? And time eventually convinces most of us that forgiveness is a virtue. Conveniently, cowardice and forgiveness look identical at a certain distance. Time steals your nerve. \nIf time and fear aren't enough to dissuade people from their revenge, then there's always authority, softly shaking its head and saying, We understand, but you're the better man for letting it go. For rising above it. For not sinking to their level. And besides, says authority, if you try anything stupid, we'll lock you up in a little room. \nBut they already put you in a little room, didn't they? Only they don't really lock it or even guard it too carefully because you're a cripple. A corpse. A vegetable who probably wouldn't remember to eat or take a shit if someone wasn't there to remind you. \nAnd as for the passage of time, well, that doesn't really apply to you anymore, does it? Just the same ten minutes, over and over again. So how can you forgive if you can't remember to forget? \nYou probably were the type to let it go, weren't you? Before. But you're not the man you used to be. Not even half. You're a fraction; you're the ten-minute man. \nOf course, weakness is strong. It's the primary impulse. You'd probably prefer to sit in your little room and cry. Live in your finite collection of memories, carefully polishing each one. Half a life set behind glass and pinned to cardboard like a collection of exotic insects. You'd like to live behind that glass, wouldn't you? Preserved in aspic. \nYou'd like to but you can't, can you? You can't because of the last addition to your collection. The last thing you remember. His face. His face and your wife, looking to you for help. \nAnd maybe this is where you can retire to when it's over. Your little collection. They can lock you back up in another little room and you can live the rest of your life in the past. But only if you've got a little piece of paper in your hand that says you got him. \nYou know I'm right. You know there's a lot of work to do. It may seem impossible, but I'm sure if we all do our part, we'll figure something out. But you don't have much time. You've only got about ten minutes, in fact. Then it starts all over again. So do something with the time you've got. \nEARL OPENS HIS EYES and blinks into the darkness. The alarm clock is ringing. It says 3:20, and the moonlight streaming through the window means it must be  he early morning. Earl fumbles for the lamp, almost knocking it over in the process. Incandescent light fills the room, painting the metal furniture yellow, the walls yellow, the bedspread, too. He lies back and looks up at the stretch of yellow ceiling tiles above him, interrupted by a handwritten sign taped to the ceiling. He reads the sign two, maybe three times, then blinks at the room around him. \nIt is a bare room. Institutional, maybe. There is a desk over by the window. The desk is bare except for the blaring alarm clock. Earl probably notices, at this point, that he is fully clothed. He even has his shoes on under the sheets. He extracts himself from the bed and crosses to the desk. Nothing in the room would suggest that anyone lived there, or ever had, except for the odd scrap of tape stuck here and there to the wall. No pictures, no books, nothing. Through the window, he can see a full moon shining on carefully manicured grass. \nEarl slaps the snooze button on the alarm clock and stares a moment at the two keys taped to the back of his hand. He picks at the tape while he searches through the empty drawers. In the left pocket of his jacket, he finds a roll of hundred-dollar bills and a letter sealed in an envelope. He checks the rest of the main room and the bathroom. Bits of tape, cigarette butts. Nothing else. \nEarl absentmindedly plays with the lump of scar tissue on his neck and moves back toward the bed. He lies back down and stares up at the ceiling and the sign taped to it. The sign reads, GET UP, GET OUT RIGHT NOW. THESE PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO KILL YOU. \nEarl closes his eyes. \nThey tried to teach you to make lists in grade school, remember? Back when your day planner was the back of your hand. And if your assignments came off in the shower, well, then they didn't get done. No direction, they said. No discipline. So they tried to get you to write it all down somewhere more permanent. \n", "test1_input": "Leonard looks down. The waiter hands him a BROWN ENVELOPE and a MOTEL ROOM KEY (DISCOUNT INN, ROOM 304).

Kenny, Bobby, McNamara, Rusk, Bundy and half of EXCOM stand to the side of the room.  General Sweeney and LeMay stand in front of the President's desk. 
The President, bowed in the window, is care-worn, a thousand years old.  The shadow, the composition of the SHOT tells us all.  It's down to what's in the heart of one man.  Kenny is deeply moved at his friend's Gethsemane. 
THE PRESIDENT Cam, can you guarantee me you'll get all the missiles? 
Sweeney glances at LeMay.  LeMay's stern, frozen look wills him to say, very simply, "yes." 
But then the President turns around, looks Sweeney in the eye.  It would make Machiavelli himself tell the truth. 
GENERAL SWEENEY Sir, I can guarantee we'll get all the missiles we know about. 
The President holds Sweeney in his gaze.  Thank you. 
LEMAY Mr. President, we can get better than ninety percent of them. 
The President doesn't respond to LeMay's last-ditch appeal. Ninety-percent isn't good enough with nuclear weapons.  He moves to his desk, signs a paper, hands it to General Sweeney. 
THE PRESIDENT As of seven o'clock Monday night, all United States armed forces world wide will stand up to DEFCON 3. 
EXT. BARKSDALE AFB - SUNSET 
SUPER: MONDAY, OCTOBER 22ND.  DAY 7 
A DEAFENING WHINE.  And INTO FRAME yawns the enormous spinning mouth of a B-52 bomber jet engine.  It closes on us, sucking us in like a maelstrom, but at the last second the CAMERA SLIPSTREAMS OVER IT -- 
-- carrying us over the aircraft's wing.  The CAMERA pivots and the vast war machine crawls away underneath joining -- 
-- a long LINE of identical behemoths, in single file inching down a taxi way which vanishes into the distance.  As the plane's immense vertical tail WIPES OUR VIEW: 
EXT. MISSILE SILO - NIGHT 
The CAMERA races toward a spotlighted concrete emplacement, over the immense BLAST DOOR which is sliding open, and DOWN -- 
INT. MISSILE SILO - CONTINUOUS 
-- into the depths of a missile silo.  The CAMERA speeds down the side of the Titan missile, through CLOUDS of steaming liquid hydrogen, past FUELING HOSES which clamp one by one to the rocket's side, past GANTRY ARMS pulling away.  The CAMERA hurtles all the way to the bottom, SMASHING THROUGH THE FLOOR TO: 
EXT. CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT 
The dark ocean, whitecaps whipping luminous around the aircraft carrier, U.S.S. ESSEX and her escorts.  Running lights flash red and green. 
The carrier's SIREN begins a lonely, eerie WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP like some immense creature which has lost its mind.  The ship FILLS THE SCREEN, CUTTING US INTO: 
INT. WEST WING - CONTINUOUS 
The doors to the Cabinet room.  A beat.  Then they SWING WIDE.  The President emerges, livid fury on his face, leaving chaos behind: the Congressional briefing.  Kenny comes out a beat later, catches up with him. 
KENNY You'd worry that something was wrong if Congress offered you unconditional support. 
THE PRESIDENT They want this fucking job, they can have it.  It's no great joy to me. 
The President exhales, getting control. 
THE PRESIDENT (CONT'D) The elected representatives of the people have spoken... (beat; determined) Now let's tell the people... 
INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT 
Kenny stands there in the doorway, arms folded.  As we PULL AWAY FROM HIM, we REVEAL the three NETWORK T.V. CAMERAS staring straight at us.  Their red lights go on as one, and we swing around REVERSING TO: 
The President at his desk: telegenic, powerful. 
THE PRESIDENT Good evening, my fellow citizens.  This Government, as promised, has maintained the closest surveillance of the Soviet military build-up on the island of Cuba... 
EXT. BARKSDALE AFB - NIGHT 
The first B-52 trundles to a stop at the end of the runway. It begins to throttle-up, the ROAR of its engine mounting... 
THE PRESIDENT (V.O.) ...unmistakable evidence has now established the fact that a series of missile sites is in preparation on that imprisoned island.  The purpose of these bases can be none other than to proved a nuclear strike capability against the Western Hemisphere... 
-- AND DROWNING OUT the President's speech as the plane lurches forward, down the runway into the night. 
EXT. MISSILE SILO - NIGHT 
The Titan solo door GRINDS OPEN.  And the missile inside begins to rise into the white bath of the crossed spotlights. 
THE PRESIDENT (V.O.) Therefore, in the defense of our own security and under the authority of the Constitution, I have directed that the following initial steps be taken. First, to halt this offensive build-up, a strict quarantine -- 
EXT. CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT 
The President's words conjure the ESSEX battlegroup, its destroyers plunging through heavy seas, lit up in the night. 
THE PRESIDENT (V.O.) -- on all offensive military equipment under shipment to Cuba is being initiated.  All ships of any kind bound for Cuba, if found to contain cargoes of offensive weapons, will be turned back. Second: I have directed the continued and increased close surveillance of Cuba and its military build-up.  Should these offensive military preparations continue, further action will be justified -- 
EXT. OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS - NIGHT 
A flight of F-4 PHANTOMS drops INTO FRAME, lights flashing. 
THE PRESIDENT (V.O.) -- I have directed the Armed Forces to prepare for any eventualities. 
INT. OVAL OFFICE - NIGHT 
A beat.  And the President looks up from his notes. 
THE PRESIDENT And third: it shall be the policy of this nation to regard any nuclear missile launched from Cuba against any nation in the Western Hemisphere as an attack by the Soviet Union on the United States, requiring a full retaliatory response upon the Soviet Union... 
The chilling words hang there in the air.  BLEEDING IN: the rising and falling WOOP WOOP WOOP WOOP which becomes -- 
EXT. CARRIBEAN SEA - NIGHT

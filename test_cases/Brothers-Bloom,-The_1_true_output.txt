But a door clicks shut, and Bloom is alone in the hall. 
196   INT. PENELOPE'S HOTEL ROOM                                    196 
Penelope in bed. Her door cracks open, and she sleepily looks up. Bloom stands silhouetted in the doorway. 
PENELOPE Tomorrow it all starts. 
She lifts the sheets. He gets into bed, and as she drifts into peaceful slumber Bloom is very conscious of holding her for the last time. 
When her snores begin, he has ear plugs ready. 
197   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG - SUNRISE                                 197 
The Peugeot drives into the heart of the city. 
198   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG ALLEY - DAY                               198 
Bloom, Stephen and the Chink parked in an alley, watching a doorway across the street with a pair of binoculars. 
Bloom breathes uneasily, checks his watch. 
BLOOM She gives the Dog the book, he gives her the fake money. This is taking too long. 
Just then Penelope trots out.    Metal attache case in hand. 
199   EXT. RUSSIA HIGHWAY - MORNING                                 199 
On the outskirts of town, parked beside a murky little lake. Our heroes gather around the metal attache case on the hood. 
PENELOPE He hassled me. Took forever looking the book over, haggled the price. Wanted to pay me in Rubles. 
Stephen smirks, then opens it.    The money's there. 
STEPHEN Alright.   Let's get the hell out of Russia. 
199   CONTINUED:                                                  199 
Bloom pulls the Dog's gold lighter from his pocket, takes one last glance at St. Petersburg and tosses it down into the lake. 
200   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY - MORNING                       200 
The brown Peugeot drives towards the climbing sun. 
201   INT. PEUGEOT                                                201 
The Chink drives, Stephen rides shotgun. 
Bloom and Penelope in the back seat.    He looks weary. 
He sees the bridge approaching, maybe a half mile ahead. 
She pulls his head down into her lap, fingers in his hair. He breathes, closes his eyes. 
An explosion shatters the front passenger window. 
Bloom's eyes snap open, he bolts upright. 
The bridge is still a quarter mile away. 
In the next moment the car becomes a din of breaking glass, screams, tires screeching. 
202   EXT. ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                                 202 
A BLACK MERCEDES roars out on to the road, machine gun fire blazing from its windows, literally shredding the Peugeot. 
The car spins, tires flapping, and hits a highway embankment full speed, launching into the air. 
203   INT. PEUGEOT                                                203 
A moment of strange silence as the car flips mid-air.     The brothers lock eyes for a split second. 
204   EXT. FOREST BESIDE ST. PETERSBURG HIGHWAY                   204 
The car slams into the steep grassy embankment, manages to flip upright, and rolls into a thick forest, coming to an abrupt stop against a stout tree. 
204   CONTINUED:                                                    204 
STEPHEN OUT! 
They all four dive out of the car, Bloom shoving Penelope, tumbling into the thick forest an instant before the car becomes a roiling ball of flame. 
Bloom lies shell-shocked, his vision blurry. He vaguely sees Penelope passed out beside him, Stephen on the other side of the car. 
A DARK FIGURE comes trotting into the woods, shining a flashlight on the charred car. Goes to Stephen. Reaches down to him... 
Bloom's mind flutters away into darkness. 
205   INT. FOREST - DAY                                                205 
Bloom wakes. Rain splattering.       Slumped against a tree. Penelope hunches over him. 
BLOOM What happened? 
PENELOPE Are you alright?

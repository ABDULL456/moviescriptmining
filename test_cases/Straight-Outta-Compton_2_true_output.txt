56      EXT. HOTEL - POOL SIDE - NIGHT                               56 
Surrounded by GROUPIES, living the life, the GANG hangs by the pool. Odd looks are sent their way from snobby HOTEL GUESTS, a school of fish out of water as -- 
JERRY looks worried as he makes a bee-line toward the pool in his trademark velvet sweat suit, LETTER in hand. He officiously hands it to Eazy, who scans it. Growls: 
EAZY The muthafuckin' FBI? 
These words catch everybody's attention. We catch a GLIMPSE OF THE LETTER on FBI stationary -- Dre snatches it from Eazy. 
DRE Damn, they comin' after us, too? 
Now Cube leans over -- reads aloud: 
CUBE "... advocating violence and assault is wrong and we in the law enforcement community take exception to such action." Have they ever heard of freedom of speech? What the fuck can they do to us? 
JERRY It's a warning. A message to our record label about "Fuck the Police". We should really think about not performing that song for a while. 
That doesn't sit well with the group. Moans and growns are heard. 
JERRY (CONT'D) (over their PROTESTS) Relax. RELAX. No need to worry-- All I'm saying is, we should be aware of this threat... 
CUBE If it was from the LAPD, then I'd be worried. 
EAZY We should all be happy, not worried. This is a gift, man. More free publicity for NWA. (waves letter) That's why we gonna send this to the press. Let everybody know about this kind of harassment and intimidation by the government. Right, Jerry? 
Jerry does not think this is the best idea ever but... 
JERRY Well, uh. If that's what you wanna do, then maybe we -- 
EAZY Do it, Jerry. Let everybody see this bullshit. 
Eazy gives the letter back to Jerry, who walks off, leaving the boys all hanging pool side. After a deliberative beat: 
CUBE I guess freedom of speech don't mean shit. 
REN Not if you a nigga wit an attitude. 
All they guys look at each other. Eazy ain't worried about nothing-- he puts on his Locs and continues to kick it. 
A57    QUICK CUTS:                                                A57 
Of different POLICE OFFICERS from DIFFERENT CITIES across the U.S., each reciting their city's obscenity ordinance, one line bleeding into the next:

57     INT. JOE LOUIS ARENA - BACK STAGE - DETROIT - NIGHT         57 
SUPERIMPOSE: AUGUST 6, 1989 - DETROIT, MI. 
We catch a serious and quiet Cube along with the rest of NWA - - and Jerry Heller -- gathered as a local POLICE OFFICER reads to them from a piece of PAPER -- Eazy has on his ski mask. 
POLICE OFFICER -- committing any obscene, indecent or immoral act in a public place. Note also that performance of the song "F The Police" will not be permitted. Refusal to abide by all Detroit City Ordinances will result in immediate arrest and forfeiture. 
CUBE Are we finished, man? We got a show to do. 
The Cop sneers at Cube, walks off, throws another shot -- 
POLICE OFFICER Just watch yourselves. 
REN Yeah-- You watch yourselves too. 
He stares back at Ren one more time -- before leaving. 
Eazy takes off his hockey mask. All the GUYS are looking at each other. Eazy and Jerry head off across the room for a private chat -- 
Ren looks at Cube -- Cube looks at Dre -- Yella looks at the perfect ass of a passing FEMALE OFFICER. 
YELLA (to himself) Yeah man, fuck the po-lice for real. 
He laughs and sticks his tongue out. 
58   INT. JOE LOUIS ARENA - STAGE - LATER                        58 
With Dre spinning, Cube, Ren and Yella hype the crowd as Eazy tears up the final bars of STRAIGHT OUTTA COMPTON -- 
EAZY This is the auto-biography of the E, and if you ever fuck with me you'll get taken, by a stupid dope brotha who will smother, word to the motherfucka, straight outta Compton. 
The CROWD goes insane as the CHORUS PLAYS OUT. Like a God, Eazy pimp strides off stage where Jerry awaits, all smiles, arms open as -- 
BACK ON STAGE, Cube, Dre, Yella and Ren are feeling defiant. CUBE addresses the amped CROWD: 
CUBE Yo hold up, hold up -- Y'all know what the muthafuckin' po-lice just told us back stage? They tired to tell us-- what the fuck we can't say-- what the fuck we can't play! 
The CROWD HOLLERS and BOOS their disapproval. 
CUBE (CONT'D) Put ya middle finger in the air!

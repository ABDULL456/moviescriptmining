SHERIFF God'll understand if you have to drown her in the basement, Henry. 
The Sheriff sighs, nods to Wayne. Wayne puts the car in gear. 
EXT. ARMORED TRUCK - NIGHT 
The water is creeping up the sloping hood of the truck. 
CHARLIE We gotta get out of here. 
TOM What about the money? 
CHARLIE The money's safe; we're not. Water rose about a foot in the last twenty minutes. The National Guard isn't going to be here for another hour. You do the math. 
Tom shrugs -- Charlie's right. They're about to get out when light washes up on them. They look out to see... 
THE HEADLIGHTS OF A GMC SUBURBAN 
Approaching on the other side of the dip, a quarter-mile away. 
CHARLIE AND TOM 
Look at each other then get out of the truck. 
THE SUBURBAN 
Stops on the far side of the dip -- a hundred yards away. The headlights shine across the water. Doors open and MEN get out. 
TOM AND CHARLIE 
Come around the front of the truck. They can't see through the glare of the Suburban's bright headlights. 
CHARLIE Hello! 
MAN'S VOICE You okay? You stuck? 
CHARLIE Yes! 
MAN'S VOICE We'll see if we can get you out! We'll be right over! 
Charlie looks at Tom, relieved. 
CHARLIE Looks like we might just -- 
THE SUBURBAN 
Headlights go on high beam. 
CHARLIE AND TOM 
Squint, blinded by the high beams. 
TOM Why'd they do that? 
CHARLIE Probably so they can see better. 
TOM Or so we can't see at all. 
Charlie looks at him -- what does he mean? Tom puts his hand on his pistol. 
IN THE WATER 
Assembled by the Suburban are... 
JIM AND HIS MEN 
All holding guns. He speaks to them quietly. 
JIM This is my retirement fund, boys, and if any one of you screws up, I swear to God I'll kill you. Let's go. 
They start wading down into the dip in the road. Kenny carries a rifle. 
TOM AND CHARLIE 
Tom squints through the bright light. 
CHARLIE Company dispatch and the National Guard are the only ones who know we're here. 
TOM Anyone with a scanner from Radio Shack could've intercepted your call, Charlie. 
CHARLIE (realizes) Jesus. 
TOM (to Jim and men) Could you turn down your lights?! 
JIM We're bringing a rope! 
TOM Turn down your lights! 
JIM We'll be right there! 
Tom starts to pull his gun. 
KENNY 
is fired up on adrenalin. He has his rifle up and is aiming it. 
HIS POV 
Tom with his hand on his pistol, starting to pull it out. 
TOM AND CHARLIE 
Charlie sees Tom going for his gun. He moves close to Tom, half in front of him, putting his hand on Tom's. 
CHARLIE Take it easy, Tom. 
KENNY

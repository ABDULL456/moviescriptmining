GLEN I'll pitch my voice wherever I please! His name ain't Hi Jr.! His name ain't Ed Jr.! But it's junior an right! Yes sir, it's Nathan Jr.! 
Hi takes one step down holding out a calming hand. 
Glen takes two nervous steps away and reassures himself by resting a hand on the door of his station wagon. 
GLEN ...Stay away from me, McDunnough! 
Hi stops short. Glen smiles. 
GLEN ...Sure, you're an awful big man when you got somethin' around to clobber a guy with! 
HI (softly) I ain't a big man. 
GLEN That's right! And now you're at my mercy! 
He spits on the dirt in front of him. 
GLEN ...I'm your worst nightmare!  I wanted to just turn you in for the re-ward. But Dot, she wants something to cuddle. So it looks like that baby's gonna be Glen Jr. From now on! 
Hi's face is set in rigid dismay. 
GLEN ...I'll give you a day to break the news to Ed... 
Glen is getting into his car. 
GLEN ...Dot'll be by tomorrow to pick him up. 
He slams the door. 
GLEN ...It's either that or jail. Oh and say, that reminds me! You'll find a doctor bill in the mail in a few days. I recommend you pay it! 
And the car squeals off. 
Hi looks back at the trailer. 
HIS POV 
A slat in the window blind drops back into place. 
BACK TO HI 
He opens the door. 
INT. TRAILER 
Evelle is already emerging from the bedroom with the baby in his arms. 
Hi moves toward Evelle. His teeth are set; he means business. 
HI What's goin' on here. 
Gale steps in front of Hi. 
GALE You know what's goin' on, H.I. It's just business. Now this can go either hard or easy- 
Hi gives Gale a hard push to get past him. Gale staggers back but recovers and grabs Hi in a bear hug. 
Hi flips Gale. Gale lands on a coffee table which flips up and crashes back down. 
Evelle is dancing back out of Hi's reach. As Hi lunges for him the prostrate Gale grabs his legs. 
Hi goes down hard. 
Gale leaps to his feet and - CRASH - bangs his head up against an overhanging lamp. Both of his hands fly up to massage the top of his head. 
THOOMP - Hi's fist flies into frame to connect with Gale's unguarded stomach. Gale doubles over, clutching at his gut. 
Hi interlaces his fingers to make a club of his two hands. 
With Gale's bowed head a target in front of him, Hi swings his hands up over his head. 
Hi's knuckles scrape painfully against the plaster of the too - low ceiling. Skin is flayed, plaster crumbles. 
Hi grabs at his knuckles in pain. Gale lunges with a mid- body tackle that sends Hi crashing into the wall. 
Gale, still on top of him, reaches back to throw a punch. 
The reach-back sends his elbow crashing through a window but doesn't stop the punch. 
It connects with Hi's jaw. 
Gale throws another quick punch, all his weight behind it. Hi's head bobs sideways just in time and Gale's fist goes through the wall. It is momentarily stuck there. 
Hi uses the opportunity to grab Gale's one free arm with both of his. He is twisting it to make Gale, roaring with pain, twist around and present his back to him. 
Hi climbs aboard, grabbing Gale's face. 
Gale, still roaring, is pulling his fist out of the hole. He grabs a lath exposed by the hole and pulls; it tears out of the wall and snaps free, giving him a length of about two feet. 
Gale is rampaging around like a grizzly bear hemmed in a too- small space. Hi is hanging on for dear life, his own feet flailing this way and that, knocking over lamps and wall fixtures as Gale bends and twirls about, trying to shake him loose. Gale crashes and bounces off the walls, roaring in pain and fury. 
Close shots of Gale's face show his features impossibly and grotesquely contorted by Hi's hand, squeezing, gripping and clutching at it. 
Evelle is dancing around with the baby, dodging crashing furniture and flailing body parts. 
EXT. WIDE SHOT THE TRAILER 
At the cut Gale's roaring drops out. We hear the chirping of birds and the laughter of children playing in the neighborhood. 
It is a sunny day. 
BACK TO INT. TRAILER 
Gale still roars. With a last mighty effort, he finally swings Hi off his body.

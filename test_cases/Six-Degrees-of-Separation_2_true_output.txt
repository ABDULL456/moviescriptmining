OUISA We'll get you up. 
PAUL or Dad will have a fit. 
QUISA Up at six fifteen which is any moment now and we have that wedding in Millbrook- OUISA pulls back the covers on the bed and puts the dolls on the floor. 
FLAN There's an alarm by the bed 
OUISA Your feet might hang out over the end 
PAUL If it's any problem-- 
FLAN It's only a problem if you leave. PAUL takes the alarm and sets the time. 
PAUL Six fifteen? I'll tip toe out. 
FLAN And we want to be in Cats. 
OUISA 
FLAN: 
PAUL It's done. THEY shake hands. 
GEOFFREY I'll fly back. With my wife. 
OUISA Pushy. Both of you. PAUL sits on the bed, testing it. 
PAUL He's not. Dad said I could be in charge of the extras. You'd just be extras. That's all I can promise. 
FLAK In cat suits? 
PAUL No. You can be humans. 
FLAN That's very important. It has to be in our contracts. We are humans. 
THEY all return down 
THE HALL. 
GEOFFREY We haven't got any business done tonight. 
FLAN Forget it. It was only an evening at home. 
OUISA Whatever you do, don't think about elephants. GEOFFREY puts on his overcoat. 
PAUL Did I intrude? FLAN and OUISA No! 
PAUL I'm sorry - Oh Christ - GEOFFREY (to Flan) 
There's all ways of doing business. Flanders, walk me to the elevator. 
OUISA Love to Diana. OUISA kisses GEOFFREY on the cheek. 
MILLBROOK CLUB BAR It seems the BRIDE and GROOM have joined the people listening to FLAN and OUISA's tale. 
OUISA We embraced. And Flan and Geoffrey left - 
BACK IN THE KITTREDGE'S HALL FLAN walks GEOFFREY to the elevator, leaving OUISA and PAUL alone. PAUL and OUISA look at each other. Then PAUL breaks the moment and goes to 
THE DINING ROOM. 
_ PAUL Let me clean up - 
OUISA follows. 
OUISA Hal Leave it for - PAUL looks at the table filled with dishes and bowls and glasses and napkins. 
PAUL Nobody comes in on Sunday. PAUL snuffs out the candles with his fingers. 
OUISA Yvonne will be in on Tuesday. 
PAUL You'll have every bug in Christendom - The room is dark, -lit only from the living room. THEY both reach for the dishes. 
OUISA Let me - 
PAUL takes the dishes. 
PAUL No. You watch. It gives me a thrill to be looked at. PAUL looks at HER. OUISA is momentarily at a loss. PAUL goes into the kitchen. The service door into the kitchen swings back and forth.

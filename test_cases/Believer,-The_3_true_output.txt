BILLINGS What?? 
CARLETON That was an ark, man. That was a Torah. They fucked around with it, and the Torah melted their faces. 
BILLINGS That's a movie, you moron. 
CARLETON Fine, go ahead. Touch the letters. 
The others are gathered around, delicately touching the sheepskin. 
BILLINGS Let me see. 
He pushes through, looks at the Torah. He runs his fingers over the crinkled parchment, the smooth black letters. 
DANNY I said not on the -- 
Suddenly Billings grabs the parchment in both hands and tries to tear it. It's tougher than it looks. 
DANNY Stop it! What are you doing? 
He tries to stop him, but -- accidentally or not -- Drake gets in the way, and before Danny can do anything else, Billings crumples it and finally tears a long gash into the scroll. 
This produces a strange effect on the others. Some (Kyle, Steroid, Drake) join in. They knock the aitz off the bema, it rolls out, exposing ten feet of Torah. They stamp on it, spit on it.... Others (Carleton, O.L.), though less troubled than Danny, are surprised (and embarrassed) by their own revulsion at these acts. 
Danny watches helplessly, like the survivor who did nothing as his son was murdered. 
Finally the Torah lies torn and soiled on the stage. A strange silence. 
KYLE Let's get out of here. 
...Danny kneels by the Torah. With a tallis, he attempts to clean the parchment. Carleton and O.L. help him roll it onto the aitz. [Echo "Christ taken down from cross" with Torah as Christ.] They replace the cover, the yod, the crowns.... 
Finally Danny lifts it up, holds it to him as if it were his dead child. He closes his eyes, murmurs to himself.... 
DANNY Shema yisrael adonai elohenu adonai echod. 
CARLETON What'd you say? 
DANNY Nothing. Let's go.... 
He starts to walk out, carrying the Torah. 
CARLETON Why are you taking that? 
DANNY I'm stealing it. 
EXT. AHAVAT TORAH -- DAY 
A VIDEO IMAGE: 
NEWSCASTER VOICE (V.O.) ...Tragedy was barely averted today at Temple Ahavat Torah when a bomb planted under the bema failed to detonate.... 
KYLE (O.S.) Shit! 
NEWSCASTER VOICE (V.O.) ...Authorities say that if it had, injuries and loss of life could have been in the dozens.... 
INT. DANNY'S MOTEL ROOM -- DAY 
Danny, Kyle and others watching the TV. 
NEWSCASTER VOICE Channel 8's Cindy Pomerantz spoke to Rabbi Malcolm Weiss. 
ON TV: Cindy (sleek, sexy) and the rabbi (handsome, vain). 
CINDY (ON TV) Rabbi, how is it that disaster and tragedy were averted here today at Ahavat Torah? 
RABBI (ON TV) Apparently the power cell in the timer gave out precisely thirteen minutes before the device was set to go off. So we can only conclude that once again God has intervened to save the Jewish people.... 
DANNY (giving the finger to the TV) Oh, fuck you... 
RABBI (ON TV) As you know, Cindy, thirteen is a mystical number in the Jewish faith. We believe that God has thirteen attributes... 
Danny is beside himself. 
RABBI (ON TV) ...Of which the highest is ein sof, which means "without end," or, sometimes, "nothingness without end...." 
CINDY (ON TV) Nothingness without end.... That's very interesting.

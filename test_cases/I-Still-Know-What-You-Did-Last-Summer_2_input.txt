RAY I understand something. 
JULIE It's not like that. It's not you. It's me. My head. I want to go back. I want to be with you. I want to be fine. I want everything to be like it used to be. (beat) It just isn't. 
Ray is hurt and confused. 
JULIE (cont'd) Hey, why don't you stay up here? They have fireworks over the river. And...there's a million things to do. 
RAY I have to work, Julie. My boat's in Southport, remember? But, I get it. You need your space from Craokerland. And maybe from me, too. 
Ray starts walking away. 
RAY (cont'd) You know where to find me. 
JULIE Ray? Ray? At least come up for a while. 
Ray keeps on walking. 
RAY It's okay. I'm just gonna go. 
Julie follows him out to the road. A group of LAUGHING STUDENTS block her way. 
JULIE Ray, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... (to herself) I'm just scared...that's all. 
But Ray is already gone. Julie stares after him a beat, then turns quickly to her door. She clearly feels uncomfortable, exposed on the walk alone. She nervously pulls her keys. A can of mace dangles from the keychain. 
CUT TO: 
5	EXT. JULIE'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Students throw FRISBEE in the street. Ray walks to his old truck, which is wedged between a new Sport Utility and a BMW. 
He clambers into the front seat. He thinks. Then, digs into his pocket and pulls out the unmistakable shape of an ENGAGEMENT RING BOX. He throws it in the glove box, starts the truck and drives away. 
CUT TO: 
6	INT. JULIE'S APARTMENT DOORWAY - DAY 
Julie opens the door and steps inside. She locks three deadbolts. She stands there, alone, listening to the SILENCE. She doesn't even have a cat. A faucet DRIPS in the kitchen. 
6A	INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - DAY 
The faucet DRIPS. Julie turns the handle. No success. She checks the lock on each window. She stands for a moment. 
She picks up a bag of chips and eats a handful. She opens the fridge and takes out a can of nacho cheese sauce. She grabs a soft drink and a jar of bread-and-butter pickles. She gets some cookies from a shelf. She thinks. Opens the freezer, pulls out some fat-free sorbet. 
She takes the whole mess toward her bedroom. 
6B	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - DAY 
She hits the light switch. A bedside light goes on. It's a sparsely furnished room. The bed is pilled high with pillows. She checks the windows, then climbs into bed with the food. 
On the bedside table are pictures of family and friends. She looks at one of Helen and Barry. She looks around the room. It's depressing. 
Outside we hear young people having fun, slamming car doors, going places. She picks at the food, then puts it on the table. She turns off the bedside light and enjoys the golden late afternoon glow in the room. 
DISSOVE TO: 
6C	INT. JULIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Julie, sound asleep, is curled into fetal position on the bed. 
There's a CLICK in the front hall. And ANOTHER. 
Julie's eyes shoot open. She listens. Another SOUND, almost like the front door being CLOSED. 
Her arm reaches for the bedside light. She hits the switch. The bulb POPS. 
JULIE (whispers) Okay. Okay. Face your fears... 
She gets off the bed and stands still. 
JULIE (cont'd) (whisper) There's nothing... 
There's another NOISE down the hall. 
JULIE (cont'd) (whisper) Quiet. 
Julie silently scoots out of her bedroom toward the kitchen. 
6D	INT. JULIE'S KITCHEN - NIGHT 
She gets a large KNIFE. She listens. It sounds like somone's in the living room. She steps through the kitchen door. 
As she moves we see a shadow pass the other way down the hallway toward her bedroom. 
6E	INT. JULIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
There's NO ONE there. 
JULIE (cont'd) Okay, calm down, imagination. 
She relaxes until she sees that her front door is slightly AJAR, light from the hallway slanting through.

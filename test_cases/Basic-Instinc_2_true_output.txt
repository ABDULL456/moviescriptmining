The Porsche rockets up the steps -- bouncing high into the air, almost out of control. 
INT. THE PORSCHE 
As it crests the steps and gets to the street.  Nick GUNS it and it looks like it flies high down the hill-side into blackness. 
EXT. THE STREET 
But it lands on more steps -- heading downward -- bucking, almost spinning, it bounces onto the next street. 
INT. THE PORSCHE 
Another set of steps leading up he GUNS it, it rockets up, ROARS, bucking -- 
EXT. THE STREET 
And lands on the next street.  Nick makes a wild right turn onto the street.  And the black Ferrari appears from around a curve to the right, heading right for him. 
INT. THE PORSCHE 
Nick steps on the GAS and heads head-on for the Ferrari. 
The Ferrari SCREAMS head-on for him. 
EXT. THE STREET 
And at the last moment, in the game of chicken, the Ferrari tries to swerve around him on this narrow road, goes out of control and over the side, turning over and over as it rolls down the hillside. 
EXT. THE HILLSIDE 
The Ferrari has landed right-side up. 
He runs down the hillside and gets to it.  A beat, and he opens the car door. 
Roxy lies hunched over the wheel, her eyes open.  Her neck is broken.  She is dead. 
EXT. THE HILLSIDE - NIGHT 
Police lights have been set up.  He stands there with Lt. Walker and several of the Internal Affairs men. 
LT. WALKER Tell me again.  I want to hear you say it again. 
NICK (after a beat; sheepish) It was an accident. 
LT. WALKER You're driving around North Beach for no particular reason and this car won't get out of the way -- 
NICK I don't think she meant to go off the hill, do you? 
LT. WALKER (quietly) Don't fuck with me, Nick.  I don't need a reason to put your ass in a sling. 
He and Nick look at each other a long beat.  Andrews comes up to them with a piece of paper in his hand. 
ANDREWS Full name, Roxanne Hardy.  Last address -- Cloverdale, California. No priors, no convictions.  The car is registered to Catherine Tramell. 
Lt. Walker looks at Nick like he's going to kill him.  Nick looks calmly away. 
LT. WALKER You knew her, didn't you? 
NICK Gus and I talked to her at Tramell's house.  All we did was write her name down. 
LT. WALKER (after a beat) I told you to stay away from Tramell. 
NICK (after a beat; smiles) Yeah.  But you didn't tell me to stay away from her car. 
Walker looks at him in absolute disbelief. 
AN I.A. MAN I want you in Dr. Gardner's office at nine o'clock.  You're out of control, Curran. 
NICK (to the I.A. Man) Who are you guys gonna sell my file to this time? 
They stare at him.  He watches as Roxy's body is taken away. 
INT. A POLICE CONFERENCE ROOM -DAY 
He walks in.  He looks good, in control.  Beth Gardner is sitting there with two middle-aged MEN, both of them wearing suits, who smile and scrutinize him the instant he walks in the door. 
BETH Hello, Nick.  This is Dr. Myron and R. McElwaine.  They've been asked to consult with me on this evaluation. 
They shake hands with him. 
DR. MYRON Sit down, Nick.

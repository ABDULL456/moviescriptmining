ALYSSA Come on. 
HOLDEN Just...uh... just give me a moment. 
INT AIRPORT - DAY 
Holden enters. Banky tries to balance way-too-much luggage. 
HOLDEN Look at you.  It's a two day trip. 
BANKY I got the Sega in one bag, my clothes in the other, and two months worth of unread comics in this one. 
HOLDEN We're going to a convention, for the love of God.  We'll be busy from ten 'till eight each day. When are you possibly going to have time for any of that shit?  In fact, fuck it - you're leaving some of this shit here in a locker.  Come on - give me the two that aren't clothes. 
BANKY Hold on. (starts rifling through one bag) 
HOLDEN What are you doing? 
BANKY I just have to get something. (pulls out a huge stack of porno books) 
HOLDEN Who are you, Larry fucking Flynt? What are you going to do with all of those? 
BANKY Read the articles.  What do you think I'm going to do with them?  They're stroke books. 
HOLDEN You've got like thirty books there! We're only there for two days! 
BANKY (leafing through mags) Variety's the spice of life.  I like a wide selection.  Sometimes I'm in the mood for nasty close-ups, sometimes I like them arty and air-brushed.  Some times it's a spread brown-eye kind of night, sometimes it's girl-on-girl time.  Sometimes a steamy letter will do it, sometimes - not often, but sometimes - I like the idea of a chick with a horse. 
A beeping sound is heard.  Holden checks his beeper. 
HOLDEN Go check us in.  I've gotta call Alyssa. 
BANKY His master's voice. 
HOLDEN Put that stuff away. 
Holden exits.  Banky starts packing his mags up.  A little KID enters, staring at him. 
KID What are those? 
BANKY (looks at kid then books) Do you Like horsies? 
Holden finishes dialing the phone.  Cross cut between him and Alyssa at home. 
ALYSSA I hope for the sake of the women you've dated that you're only this quick in returning calls. 
HOLDEN What's up?  I'm about to get on a plane. 
ALYSSA Ohhh.  Why! 
HOLDEN Last minute invite to the Dragon Con'. 
ALYSSA Shit. 
HOLDEN What? 
ALYSSA My sister's at my parents'.  I was gonna go see her. 
HOLDEN The one that wrote the book?

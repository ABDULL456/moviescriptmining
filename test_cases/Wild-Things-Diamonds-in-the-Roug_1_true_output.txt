More like widows... Gotta say I was a little taken aback when you wanted to snuff Marie, but you know what, I'm over 
the bitch... 
Elena suddenly gets to her feet. 
ELENA You want me to top you off? 
JAY That'd be fine, just fine. 
He hands Elena his empty glass, then kisses Kristen tenderly. When they break... 
JAY She's got a good head on her shoulders. 
Kristen doesn't reply. Just smiles, watches Elena over by the outside bar, mixing Jay's drink... 
JAY You two got me out of a mountain of shit, I'll tell you that. Craziest Goddamn scheme I've ever heard of. But hell, you played it perfectly. 
KRISTEN My job was easy. It was Elena who had to keep it all together... 
ELENA (O.S.) We've had some practice along the way... 
Jay turns around, smiles at Elena as she holds out his drink. 
ELENA Here you go, Mr. Clifford. 
Jay takes it from her appreciatively, sips at it as he sidles off to the swimming pool. 
JAY Well, all that nasty business, it's behind us. Forever. From here on out, it's the good life. 
He starts to climb the high dive. When he gets to the top, he looks down at Elena and Kristen, smiles. 
JAY You two look so good, it's difficult to tell which one's the mother and which one's the daughter... 
Kristen calls back up at him. 
KRISTEN That's just the roofies talking... 
Says it so sweetly, it takes a moment for Jay to register the sinister implications... 
JAY What did you say? 
His eyes are blood shot. He starts to sway atop the high dive. 
KRISTEN Delta Chi, class of '88. Hellova party. I'd never really tasted cocktails like that. 
Jay's swaying uneasily on the high dive platform... 
JAY I don't...whattya talking about? 
KRISTEN It was like being awake though an operation. I could feel everything happening, but I couldn't do anything to stop it... 
JAY Oh...shit... 
KRISTEN You took something from me that night. But you left something behind... 
Jay's head is spinning as he looks to Kristen, to Elena. 
KRISTEN Your daughter... 
He can't quite get his mind around it. Everything's becoming blurry. 
JAY I don't remember... 
He looks at the martini glass, thinks he sees blue residue, before it slips from his fingers, falls 20 feet to the concrete below, shattering into a million pieces like so many fake diamonds... E lena and Kristen stand side-by-side below him. 
KRISTEN You may not remember... 
A broad grin stretches across Elena's lips as she finishes... 
ELENA ...But you'll never forget. 
Jay tries to take a step forward. He stumbles. Tries in vain to regain his balance. It's too late. He falls. 20 feet to the unyielding concrete, exploding like a paper bag filled with vegetable soup... 
ELENA Nice take off. Gotta work on the landing. 
They stand back, watching Jay's pancaked body draining its precious blood into the ice blue pool...

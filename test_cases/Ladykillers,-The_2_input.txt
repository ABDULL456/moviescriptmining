The cellar door creaks noisily -- one might almost say gothically -- ajar, and the Professor peers out with an ingratiating smile. 
DORR Hsst... Madam... 
The chattering abates and the ladies all look at him. His smile broadens into ghastliness and he crooks a finger toward Mrs. Munson. 
DORR ...Mrs. Munson, if I might have a word... 
MRS. MUNSON You get back down those stairs! 
DORR I assure you I shall be-- 
MRS. MUNSON Hush! Down those stairs! We havin' tea now! I be down shortly. 
He nods meekly and retreats, easing the door creakily shut. 
The ladies look inquisitively at Mrs. Munson as his footsteps are heard descending the stair. 
MRS. MUNSON ...He's the tenant. 
LADIES Mm-hm. 
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - CELLAR DAY 
As the Professor rejoins the still staring and silent group. The money has been picked up and is once again in stacks upon the table. 
DORR She shall be down shortly... 
Explaining, he indicates upstairs with a jerk of the head: 
DORR ...Tea. Dainties. 
The men nod, murmuring. 
The cellar door squeaks open. There is the clomp of careful footsteps on the stair. 
Using only tongue and teeth, the General flips his smoking cigarette inwards into his mouth and gives Mrs. Munson his usual deadpan look. 
She halts halfway down the stairs, still wearing an apron and holding a spatula. 
MRS. MUNSON I don't know what you boys been up to but I wasn't born yesterday and I know mischief when I see it. Now I want an explanation, but first I want you boys to get your fannies up here with y'alls period instruments. I been tellin' the ladies about your music and they wanna hear you play. 
She turns to head back up the stairs but abruptly stops to turn and give the General a hard look which he innocently returns. 
MRS. MUNSON ...Hmph. 
She turns again and clomps back up the stairs. 
The General opens his mouth and, again without using his hands, restores his cigarette to its usual place on his lower lip. 
Lump is fretful: 
LUMP Professor? 
DORR Yes, Lump? 
LUMP I can't really play the buttsack. 
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The cellar door opens and the men troop out, G.H. Dorr leading and the other men following rather sheepishly behind. 
DORR Madame -- or rather, mesdames -- you will have to accept our apologies for failing to perform since, as you see, we are shorthanded. Gawain is still at work and we could no more play with one part tacit than a horse could canter shy one leg. 
LADIES Mm-hmm. 
MRS. MUNSON Hmph. 
DORR Perhaps I could offer as a poor but ready substitute a brief poetic recital. Though I don't pretend to great oratorical skills, I will happily present, with your ladies' permission, verse from the unquiet mind of Mr. Ed G'Allan Poe. 
Lump, Pancake, and the General sit and awkwardly accept dainty teacups. 
The Professor rises, spreads his hand, and pronounces: 
DORR ..."Ladies, thy beauty is to me Like those Nicean barks of yore..." 
CLOSE-UPS of the various ladies, some sipping tea or slowly munching biscuits, but all eyes glued to the declaiming man in the cape. 
DORR "That gently, o'er a perfumed sea The weary, wayworn wanderer bore To his own native shore... " 
Murmuring Voice: 
VOICE Amen. 
A slurp of tea from another quarter. 
Dorr bears on: 
DORR "On desperate seas long wont to roam, Thy hyacinth hair, thy classic face, Thy Naiad airs have brought me home To the glory that was Greece And the grandeur that was Rome... " 
A long silence.

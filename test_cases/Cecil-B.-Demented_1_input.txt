(TO CECIL) 
I DON'T WANT TO BE IN SHOW 
BUSINESS ANYMORE! SPROCKET HOLES freeze in horror at FIDGET'S disloyalty and stare at him in cult pressure. HONEY pops an olive into martini glass and looks up in surprise. 
CECIL 
(TO FIDGET) I knew you were the weak one, Fidget. (Eyes widening in hypnotic 
FRENZY) But just remember - your parents liked "Godzilla"! 
LYLE They wouldn't let you see R-rated films as a child! 
DINAH They've never been to a midnight movie! FIDGET starts to crack as his hand creeps in his pocket. 
CHARDONNAY They enjoy classic TV sitcoms turned into feature length films! 
CHERISH They've never rented a porno movie! FIDGET starts whacking nervously. 
CECIL (Right in FIDGET's face) And to top it off...they talk out loud in the theater once the feature has begun! SPROCKET HOLES grimace in horror. Even HONEY shakes her head in disgust as she pours martini into glass. 
HONEY That really is unforgivable, Fidget! 
FIDGET looks around at the brainwashed faces of his disgusted, judgmental cult and crumbles. HONEY greedily gulps down her martini. 
FIDGET 
OK! OK! MY PARENTS ARE THE 
ENEMY OF FILM! DO IT! PETIE brands FIDGET as CECIL smiles victoriously. HONEY, slightly tipsy, joins the SPROCKET HOLES in singing the refrain. 
ALL 
DEMENTED FOREVER! CECIL turns to HONEY as PETIE brandishes the red hot iron. 
CECIL And you...Honey? 
HONEY No, Cecil... CECIL nods to DINAH who plays the tape. HONEY sees her ex-husband, a handsome movie star on screen with JAY LENO on "The Tonight Show." 
EX-HUSBAND Well, I was married to her for seven years so I know just how nuts Honey Whitlock is... JAY LENO and STUDIO AUDIENCE howls in laughter. HONEY stares at TV, betrayed as RAVEN gently puts her t arms around her in comfort. 
RAVEN Satan loves you, Honey, and so do I. Tape cuts to LIBBY, HONEY's assistant, talking to ENTERTAINMENT TONIGHT. Subtitle on TV read "Honey Whitlock's Personal Assistant." 
LIBBY .Honey Whitlock was always attracted to the wrong kind of man. It wouldn't surprise 
(MORE) 
me if she was in on her kidnapping from the very beginning. She'd do anything for sex... HONEY howls in indignation as LYLE gives her a funny look. FIDGET pours her another quick martini. 
CECIL 
(TO HONEY) You ain't seen nothing yet! Tape cuts to FILM COMMISSIONER, bandaged but defiant. 
FILM COMMISSIONER (Looking into camera) Cecil B. DeMented, you can never stop Hollywood! The Maryland Film Commission is pleased to announce there will be nna delay in tomorrow's once-secret start date for the 65 million dollar, 
SHOT-ENTIRELY-IN-BALTIMORE SEQUEL to the Oscar-winning masterpiece, "Forrest Gump"... SPROCKET HOLES let out a cry of horror. 
FILM COMMISSIONER 
."GUMP AGAIN." CECIL's face turns to pure horror.

EDNA (stops and turns) I see. 
CARTER I'm staying with a friend. 
EDNA (continuing up the stairs) Her husband docks tomorrow, does he? 
CARTER (smiles) It's not like that, luv. 
EDNA It never is. 
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
The door opens and the light goes on. It's a big room overlooking the road, furnished cheaply but comfortably. 
Edna and Carter enter, talking. 
EDNA Are you a traveller? 
CARTER (smiling) Definitely. 
EDNA (surveying the room) Will this do? 
CARTER (looking around) Very nice. (He takes his wallet out.) I'll pay you for tonight as well. 
EDNA Don't be bloody silly. You're the first since Monday. 
CARTER You sure? 
Carter gives her the money. 
EDNA Ta. 
CARTER (feeling the mattress) I'll bet this one's seen some action. 
Carter smiles and looks straight at her. Edna returns his look, dead pan. 
EDNA I'll give you the key when you come down. 
She closes the door. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
Carter moves around the coffin as he shaves. His electric razor is plugged into the lamp above his dead brother. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The coffin lid is being screwed down. 
Carter stirs a cup of instant coffee while watching the undertakers at work. 
CARTER Was he in bad shape? 
UNDERTAKER They come worse. 
INT. HEARSE - DAY 
The hearse is parked outside the row of terraced houses. A youthful UNDERTAKER is minding it. He turns and looks through the back window as a young girl walks up the street. 
DOREEN CARTER is sixteen and, like most girls of her age, tries to look older. She wears all the right gear but it's cheap and doesn't fit properly. Her long hair is lank. There's something sad and embarrassing about her appearance. The young undertaker watches as she enters Frank's house. 
INT. FRANK CARTER'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
The door opens slowly. Doreen stands there looking at the coffin. Carter sees her. 
CARTER Doreen?

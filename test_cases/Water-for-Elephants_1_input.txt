JACOB I have to tell you something. You may not trust me after you hear it. August and Marlena pause - giving Jacob their attention. 
JACOB (CONT'D) I never took my final exams at Cornell. I'm not a real vet. Beat. Then August and Marlena burst into laughter at the dire earnestness with which Jacob made his statement. 
JACOB (CONT'D) But it's true. I never got my degree. I'm not a licensed vet. They laugh even harder. 
AUGUST BAH! A worthless piece of paper from the ivy bush league! Of course you're a vet. You have the gift. You're idealism is just so...sweet. When are you going to learn that the rules written of, by and for these united states of suckers do not apply to us. 
JACOB Not about this, August. 
AUGUST All right, let me ask you - do you honestly think this is the most spectacular show on earth? 
JACOB (Beat. Then laughs) No. 
AUGUST No. It's nowhere near. Lucinda, our Fat Lady, isn't 800 pounds. Four at the tops. And you really think the Tattooed Man got tattooed by headhunters in Borneo? He's from Pittsburgh. Took him nine years to ink himself. And you know what I did when the hippo died? Swapped out her water for formaldehyde and kept showing her. For two weeks, we travelled with a pickled hippo.. 
(MORE) 
AUGUST (CONT'D) (Jacob & Marlena laugh) ..The world is run on tricks - in here and out there. So trust me, it's having a talent that counts. In this world, it's all that's real. Look at this country, these dead, God awful towns we play. Talent and illusion bringing life to what is dead...Even for just a matinee. How wonderful is that? Jacob believes he's right. Marlena smiles in agreement. August rises to toast. Jacob and Marlena follow. 
AUGUST (CONT'D) To talent and illusion! 
JACOB To Rosie! 
MARLENA And Silver Star. August takes a beat and smiles warmly at Marlena... 
AUGUST To all we love. He leans over and kisses Marlena longer than appropriate in front of a guest. Jacob downs his wine, closing his eyes. Suddenly, August grabs Jacob and Marlena and pulls them up to dance, throwing his arm around them both as we hear: Louis Armstrong's DREAM A LITTLE DREAM OF ME. August starts singing along, imitating Satchmo's voice, encouraging Jacob to join in...August is a great performer, filling up the space with his impersonation. Jacob can only laugh along. 
AUGUST (CONT'D) Come on Jacob! It's customary to sing for your supper! Jacob joins in to perform with August. Marlena applauds them. August breaks away to dance with Marlena as Jacob sings. They begin to slow dance, very intimately. Jacob gives up singing and plops himself on an upholstered chair, drinking more champagne. Jacob watches them dance: 
JACOB (V.O.) He looked like a different man when he looked at her. I said to myself, maybe love does that to a man. I didn't know much about it. Suddenly, August kisses Marlena - a bit too aggressively. 
MARLENA Darling. Darling, please.. 
(GIGGLES) Gently. We have a guest. August stares at her. His expression darkens - locking his eyes on Marlena and tilting his head as if he is examining her. Marlena smiles and strokes his face. August doesn't respond. He remains intense... 
MARLENA (CONT'D) Darling, what is it? August takes her face by the chin and tilts it with complete control, as if searching for proof of something he can't trust. His grip tightens, hurting her. Alerted, Jacob sits up, prepared to intervene...But Marlena shows no sign of fear. She knows exactly what to do. 
MARLENA (CONT'D) August, dear... She manages to moves his hand to her mouth and kisses it. 
MARLENA (CONT'D) You don't know your own strength, my love. And then, just as quickly, August's expression softens, relaxes, almost into sadness...as if he's about to cry....Marlena senses it immediately. She whispers lovingly. 
MARLENA (CONT'D) Auggie? August stops and eyes the bed beyond them. He leaves Marlena and throws himself face first on the bed. 
MARLENA (CONT'D) Excuse me, Jacob. Jacob watches as Marlena attends to August, lifting his legs onto the bed, taking off his shoes. August begins snoring. 
Marlena smooths the hair out of his face then closes the curtains and returns to Jacob in the main room. 
JACOB Is everything all right? Marlena puts a finger to lip and keeps it there, as she returns to her Victrola and selects another record. She cranks it on and plays it low. A RUTH ETTING SONG. 
MARLENA Oh yes. He's just had too much to drink, that's all. I hope you had a good time tonight. I wanted so much to make things up to you. 
JACOB Tonight was your idea? 
MARLENA Oh Auggie wanted it too, he felt horrible about what happened. He really does like you Jacob. But it's hard for him. He's under a lot of pressure. He does more than people realize holding things together. 
JACOB You said that. 
MARLENA Well it's true... (Opens her arms to him.) One dance before you go? Jacob cautiously approaches. Marlena takes his hands but when Jacob presses closely against her and places his hand against her bare back, he almost swoons. They slow dance. Both tipsy. 
MARLENA (CONT'D) Jankowski is Polish isn't it? 
JACOB 
(NODS) Is that all right? 
MARLENA

Max flips to the stock quotes. He can't believe how far things have dovetailed. He shakes his head in disbelief when an envelope appears in front of him. It belongs to Lenny Meyer. 
LENNY MEYER The Torah. MAX What is it? LENNY MEYER In Hebrew characters and numbers. 
MAX No, what is it? The two hundred and sixteen digits. 
LENNY MEYER I don't know. (Beat) If you get it, maybe we can figure it out. (Changing subject) Can you really find it? MAX If the number's in there, I'll find it. 
EXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DUSK 
Max marches into his foyer when he's suddenly ambushed by Devi's boyfriend, Farrouhk. Farrouhk is a little guy with a big sadistic smile. 
He grabs Max by the collar and slams him against the wall. His fist butts up against Max's chin. 
FARROUHK There you go, dork. Been thinking about my girlfriend. Haven't you? MAX Wha... FARROUHK You want to fuck her, don't you? MAX No, no.. FARROUHK You calling my girlfriend ugly!? Why don't you want to fuck her? You think she's ugly? MAX No, no, I just. It's that she's your girl... 
FARROUHK So you do want to fuck her. You think about fucking her in the mouth, don't you? 
MAX No, no, sir, please. I've never touched Devi...I never will. FARROUHK Give the fucking genius a Mars bar. Stay away, or I'll slice off your balls. Farrouhk tosses Max against the wall. Max whimpers off to his apartment. Farrouhk has enjoyed this and to end his game be gives Max a small slap on the butt. 
INSIDE HIS APARTMENT Max bolts the front door. 
At his desk he rips open the envelope Lenny Meyer gave him. He pulls out a BLACK DISK and eyes it expectantly. 
Next door, he hears Farrouhk and Devi talking. 
FARROUHK (O.S.) Damn dork. DEVI (O.S.) He's just a bit unique. FARROUHK(0.S.) Unique?! Unique?! He's a dork! Then, Max carefully slips the DISK into Euclid's drive. Hebrew characters pop onto Euclid's screen. Max pounds in several strings of code lightning fast. 
The Hebrew letters suddenly switch to their numerical counterparts. Max toggles between Hebrew and numbers a few timesÂ—impressed. 
Max nods. Then there's a knock at the door.

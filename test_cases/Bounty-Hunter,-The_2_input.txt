Great. So far, so good. 
Only, MILO CAN'T RAISE HIS ARMS. AND THE PORTHOLE IS SIX FEET ABOVE THE GROUND. NOW WHAT? 
CASS Did you throw it? 
MILO Not exactly. 
CASS Well, what are you waiting for? 
MILO I'm waiting for a pig to fly in here and grab it. 
CASS (starting to panic again) Milo... 
MILO Ok, Ok. Um, on 3, I need you to jump. 
Beat. 
CASS What? 
MILO You know: "jump, jump, jump around, jump." 
CASS Are you serious? 
MILO No. I'm fucking with you. For fun. Just for my own personal enjoyment... 
CASS Ok, Ok. 
MILO Ok: 1, 2, 3... 
EXT PORTHOLE- EVENING 
We see MILO'S HEAD POP INTO VIEW, THEN DISAPPEAR. 
CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:11, 00:10, 00:09..." 
MILO'S HEAD POPS UP HIGHER... 
CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:06, 00:05, 00:04..." 
This time, MILO POPS UP HIGH ENOUGH THAT WE SEE HIS HANDS... 
CLOSE ON- THE TIMER "00:03, 00:02, 00:01..." 
And finally, MILO IS HIGH ENOUGH THAT HE CAN THRUST THE BOMB OUT THE WINDOW... 
CLOSE ON THE BOMB AS IT CRASHES INTO THE WATER... 
INT HULL OF BOAT- EVENING 
Milo and Cass, both a little out of breath, stand still, listening. Silence. 
CASS Think the water defused it? 
MILO Lemme ask you this? Has anything gone our way yet? 
SUDDENLY, A LOW ROAR FROM BENEATH GROWS AND RISES UP BENEATH THE BOAT, ROCKING IT WILDLY AS WATER EXPLODES ON ALL SIDES. 
Cass and Milo get drenched, BUT ARE SAFE. 
CASS Nice job. 
MILO Hey. You, too. 
CASS Thanks. 
MILO Now lets find something to cut these ropes off... 
CASS Think we can catch that cop? 
MILO Trust me: we can definitely catch that cop. 
Because at this very moment... 
INT MOTORBOAT- NIGHT 
...Bobby is paddling frantically, pausing every once in a while to curse the motor, WHICH FOR SOME REASON REFUSES TO START. He see the lights of another boat coming up behind him, and he paddles faster. 
EXT DECK OF YACHT- NIGHT 
Milo steers the yacht right up behind Bobby, dwarfing the motorboat. Calling out: 
MILO Hey, Bobby. I got one for ya... 
Bobby looks up to see MILO POINTING AN ASSAULT RIFLE HE GRABBED FROM THE EVIDENCE BOXES: 
MILO What's the difference between a snowman and a snowwoman? (holding something up) The spark plug.

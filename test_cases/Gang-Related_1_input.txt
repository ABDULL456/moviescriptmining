A BUTLER shows Arthur to the patio where another MAN, NATHAN MCCALL, is seated behind a table, reviewing documents. McCall is fifty-five, wears glasses. 
BUTLER Mr. Baylor is here. 
McCall looks up, smiles. 
WILLIAM Arthur. 
Arthur crosses. The two men shake hands. 
ARTHUR Nathan. How are you? 
WILLIAM Good, Arthur, thanks. Would you like some coffee, juice. 
ARTHUR No, I'm fine. 
WILLIAM Well, this is all a bit of a mystery. You certainly got my attention with your phone call. What's this all about? 
Arthur removes a NEWSPAPER from his briefcase. Opens it. Revealing the PHOTOGRAPH OF JOE and the headline: UNDERCOVER COP GUNNED DOWN BY UNDERCOVER KILLER. McCall looks at the paper. 
WILLIAM Is there something you want me to see? 
Arthur points at the photograph. McCall looks. A beat, then -- 
WILLIAM Oh my God. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BUS STATION - DAY 
Cynthia boards a greyhound. Getting the hell out of Dodge. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CYNTHIA'S APARTMENT - DAY 
We HEAR a key in the lock. The door opens and Divinci enters. He looks around. 
DIVINCI Cynthia. 
He moves into the bedroom. Sees clothes strewn around and a half empty closet. 
DIVINCI Shit! 
He heads back into the living room. Pulls open the door and almost runs into Richard Stein who was just about to knock. 
DIVINCI (startled) Jesus! 
Richard Stein is just as startled and it takes him a moment to recognize -- 
RICHARD STEIN Divinci? 
Divinci is caught off guard. 
RICHARD STEIN Richard Stein, D.A.'s office. 
DIVINCI Oh, yeah, sorry. I didn't expect -- what're you doing here? 
RICHARD STEIN I have to talk with Cynthia Webb. A witness in -- well, wait, aren't you and Detective Rodriguez on this one? 
DIVINCI (vamping) Yeah, yeah, that's why I'm here. I wanted to go over some of the details. 
RICHARD STEIN Me, too. Is she there? 
DIVINCI No. 
RICHARD STEIN I was supposed to meet her at two. (looks at watch) Do you know her? 
DIVINCI What d'you mean? 
RICHARD STEIN Well, I just mean, if she's not here... you were... (a little awkward) ...inside. 
DIVINCI (forces a smile) Oh, yeah, the legal thing. Well, she's a witness in a murder case. And when they don't answer a knock and the door's open, it's my experience, you know. I like to make sure there's no dead bodies layin' around. (pulls door shut) Don't tell on me. 
RICHARD STEIN No, no, of course not... Well, maybe I should wait. She might be stuck in traffic or something. 
DIVINCI Yeah. If she shows up, let me know. I'd like to talk to her, too. 
RICHARD STEIN Of course. 
Divinci looks at Stein for a beat, then smiles and -- 
DIVINCI See you in court. 
RICHARD STEIN Right. 
Divinci heads down the walkway. Richard Stein watches him for a moment, then looks at the closed door, then at his watch. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELLIOT'S OFFICE - DAY 
Elliot's office is a cramped space in the PUBLIC DEFENDERS FLOOR of the CRIMINAL COURTS BUILDING. A buzz of activity outside. The staff is overworked, underpaid and underappreciated. Elliot is reviewing legal documents. Knock on the door. 
ELLIOT Yeah.

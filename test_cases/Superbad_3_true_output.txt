He pulls out a little bottle of lube. 
EXT. JULES' FRONT PORCH 
Seth and Jules are both seated on the stairs. Seth has his face in his hands. Jules is patting him on the back, but clearly feels awkward. 
JULES Seth, you...uh... 
Seth looks up at her, drunk as hell, his eyes half-open. 
JULES (CONT'D) You didn't blow it, you're a- 
Seth blanks out and falls forward. BAM! He head-butts Jules in the face! 
JULES (CONT'D) AAAHHH! 
Jules clutches her eye as Seth slumps onto the patio floor, unconscious. She gets up, yelling in pain, as Seth opens his eyes. 
JULES (CONT'D) Seth! What the fuck! 
SETH ...help me... 
(CONTINUED) 137   CONTINUED:                                                    137 
Jules storms into the house, leaving Seth lying on the front porch. He wiggles around a bit. 
SETH (CONT'D) ...sorry... 
Seth passes out again. A few moments go by, when SUDDENLY a cop car pulls up in front of the house. Seth opens his eyes and sees the cops. 
SETH (CONT'D) Oh no. 
Two cops get out and start harassing two kids smoking a joint on the front lawn. One of them turns on their flashlight and Seth sees - it's OFFICER SLATER and MICHAELS!!! 
SETH (CONT'D) ...Evan... 
INT. JULES' HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
Evan, sitting on the couch next to Miroki (Evan's partner from cooking class), drinking a bottle of tequila. He's absolutely smashed. 
EVAN Life's bullshit, huh, Miroki? 
Suddenly, Seth bursts into the room and grabs Evan's shirt. 
EVAN (CONT'D) Fuckin' wax off, asshole! 
SETH No...I'm helping you, man! Just listen... 
Seth grabs Evan's wrists and tries to pull him to his feet. 
EVAN Fuck off, jerk! You're hurting my shoulders! 
Just then, Terry (the guy who spat on Seth in the beginning) walks by. 
TERRY Hey! Look, it's Christina and Britney. Have fun boning each other on grad night! 
Terry and his buddies laugh their asses off when, suddenly-

KNOCK! KNOCK! KNOCK! The loud authoritative knocking echoes through the party and everyone looks to the door, knowing it can only mean one thing. Someone opens the door, revealing Officer Slater and Officer Michaels! They talk to whoever answered the door, oblivious of Evan and Seth. 
OFFICER SLATER We had a complaint about the noise. It looks like you're having a nice little party here. 
OFFICER MICHAELS A nice little underage drinking party. 
Evan points at the cops. 
EVAN Dude! Seth! It's the cops! The cops. 
SETH That's what I've been...! Here... 
Seth pulls Evan up and the two drunkenly make their way out of the living room just as the cops step into it. 
OFFICER SLATER Okay, everyone out. Party's over. Get out of here. 
Michaels turns to Slater. 
OFFICER SLATER(CONT'D) I'll go upstairs. I told you this would release some anger. 
OFFICER MICHAELS I'll tell you what would release some anger, if one of these little fuckers touched me and I got to club his face in.

HARRY A lot of people just collapse when they see what you've s'een. Their personal choices suddenly seem meaningless to them. Life starts to feel pointless. 
DAVID I was` raised to believe there's something behind the curtain. I just never pictured it quite like this. 
HARRY Most people don't. Harry looks over his shoulder, scans for any signs of his colleagues. He's far from relaxed. 
HARRY How are you feeling? 
DAVID You should know. You can read my mind, right? 
Harry hesitates...as if he's not sure how much to tell David, how far to go with this. Finally: 
HARRY Richardson was just trying to scare you. 
DAVID He knew what color I was thinking. 
HARRY Because he set it up as a choice. "Choose a color. Choose a number" 
DAVID So? Harry looks away. He's crossing a line. He's really putting himself out there: 
HARRY We can't read your mind or hear your thoughts. But before you make a choice your brain weighs options, and we percpite that. We know if you're going to go off Plan "or not because, as long as we're close enough, we cansense it when it's about to happen. 
DAVID it-;' s like a sixth sense for you? 
HARRY Seventh, actually. 
DAVID What did they do too Charlie? 
HARRY Made some small change in the way he assesses risk. 
DAVID What type of risk? 
HARRY (this is beside the point) I don't know. Something arcane. Something to do with mortgage- backed securities. 
DAVID That's all? 
HARRY Yes. 
DAVID What would your colleagues do to you if they knew what you were telling me? This is precisely what Harry has been worried about. 
HARRY That's why we're meeting out here. 
DAVID They're not following me? 
HARRY We don't have the manpower to follow everybody all the time. They're checking in on you. Just not here. Not right now. ON David's face considering this. 
EXT. UPPER DECK DAY 
Moments later. They stand out of earshot of the few tourists up here. 
DAVID Why are you helping me? 
HARRY I have my reasons. David studies him. Ha=rry's' clearly not ready to go into 
THEM: 
DAVID Why do they care if I'm with Elise? 
HARRY Your entire reality gets shattered this morning and you want to know about a woman? 
DAVID Why do they care? Harry looks back at him. Taken aback a bit by how much David seems to care. 
HARRY I don't know. 
DAVID You have no idea? 
HARRY All I know is, given the amount of resources they've used, keeping you from her is pretty important to them. (off David's silence) You're going to look for her aren't you? Again, David is silent. 
HARRY (CONT'D) There are twelve million people in this city. On a slow day. You're not going to find her, you do realize that, don't yore-? 
(BEAT) Even if a hypnotist pulled her number out of the recesses of your brain, no matter how many times you called it, you,'d never get through... 
DAVID (his face hardening) They send you here to tell me that? 
HARRY (CONT'D) You want my advice? Forget about her. Accept that you'`>ll never see her again. Move on with your life. ON David as Harry's words sink in. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. MADISON SQUARE PARK -- MORNING

CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99 
FADE IN: 
EXT. THE BIG BLUE SKY - DAY 
A VIRGIN AIR 747 bursts through the clouds and levels off. 
INT. VIRGIN AIR 747 - DAY 
We move through the FIRST CLASS CABIN. It's the regular mix of first class people: OLD MONEY in Gucci enjoying freshly baked cookies, a MILLIONAIRE in jeans and a T- shirt, BUSINESS PEOPLE relaxing after a tough day, and... 
...a very nervous MAN. 
Shifty-eyed. Alone in an aisle seat, the emergency row. We hold on him for a moment, but not for too long. Then we continue moving into -- 
THE COACH SECTION 
Stopping at the lavatory, the "OCCUPIED" sign switches to "VACANT" and... 
JAMES EARL JONES 
(or actually, a James Earl Jones type, who for ease of description, we'll simply refer to as James Earl Jones) steps out of the restroom, in full African regalia: multi-colored dashiki, mufti (it's a kind of hat), the works. He heads up the aisle towards -- 
THE FIRST CLASS CABIN 
Where he is stopped by a -- 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT I'm sorry, sir. This cabin is restricted to first cl... 
Mr. Jones now removes a FIRST CLASS TICKET. 
JAMES EARL JONES Is this what you're looking for? 
She looks at it -- a little confused as to why he's just handing it to her now -- but then she nods. As he passes: 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Oh, I'm sorry. Please. Is there anything I can get you? 
JAMES EARL JONES Scotch, blended. Straight. 
He continues into the first class cabin and toward -- 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              2. 
THE FIRST CLASS EMERGENCY ROOM 
Where he slides in past the nervous, shifty-eyed man (his name is PASQUAL) and sits by the window. 
After a moment, Pasqual quietly clears his throat and leans, slightly, towards Jones. 
PASQUAL (tentatively) They say birds can't fly this high. 
JAMES EARL JONES They say only angels can. 
Now Pasqual nods. Nervously begins to remove something from his pocket when they are interrupted by -- 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Shall I pour your scotch? 
JAMES EARL JONES No -- I'll take the bottle. Thank you. 
She hands him the airplane-sized bottle -- he waves off the glass. She shrugs, leaving... 
Pasqual to resume what he was doing. Slowly, he removes a roll of Certs. He looks to Jones -- "Well? What about your end of the bargain?" 
From within his dashiki, Jones pulls out a black velvet pouch. He hands it to Pasqual, who opens it to find diamonds. A helluva lot of diamonds. Pasqual smiles. 
He hands the roll of Certs to Jones. It's not breath candy at all, but a tiny roll of explosives, with a tiny, high-tech triggering mechanism. 
JAMES EARL JONES Ah, c-5. The most dangerous explosive material ever invented. Hard to believe that this little contraption could blow up ten city blocks. 
PASQUAL Be careful with it, huh? 
Both men smile.   Pasqual's very relieved that the deal is done. 
Then suddenly, the lights blink out. 
Pasqual looks around, nervous. But it's just the in- flight movie beginning. Clouds, and a woman holding a torch. (CONTINUED) 
CHARLIE'S ANGELS - 8/18/99                              3. 
CONTINUED: 
Columbia Pictures presents... David Spade and Adam Sandler in "BOSOM BUDDIES: THE MOVIE." 
James Earl Jones shakes his head, rolls his eyes.

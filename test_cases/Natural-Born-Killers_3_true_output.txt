WAYNE (O.S.) Slate it. 
CAMERA SLATE reading 'KNOX INTERVIEW -- ROLL #1' is thrust into view and clapped. The CAMERA ZOOMS out to include Wayne in the FRAME. 
WAYNE So, Mickey, tell us what you do for fun. 
MICKEY Aside from the obvious? 
Mickey breaks out laughing. 
WAYNE (not amused) Yes. Aside from the obvious. 
Mickey's laughing slowly runs its course. 
MICKEY Okay, let me see now. What do I do for fun? (to people O.S.) Does anybody got a smoke? You guys are drivin' me crazy with your cigarettes. (to camera) Sorry out there in TV land. I'm just sittin' here lookin'' at these deputies smokin' up a storm, and it's really doin' it to me. 
A deputy comes into FRAME, hands Mickey a cigarette, then lights it. Deputy exits FRAME. 
MICKEY Much obliged. What do I do for fun? Do you want to know what I do for fun or what I did for fun? 
WAYNE What? Oh, aaahhh, what you did for fun for starters. 
MICKEY What I did for fun for starters. (thinking) Well, something I used to do...always was a lot of fun... (pause) No, scratch that. Let me think of something else. In fact, why don't we come back to that question. Ask me something else. 
WAYNE Do you miss Mallory? 
MICKEY Of course, I miss Mallory. She's my wife. I haven't seen her in a long time. What a stupid question. 
WAYNE Then was it worth it? 
MICKEY Was what worth it? 
WAYNE Was massacring all those people worth being separated from your wife for the rest of your life? 
Mickey takes a drag from his cigarette. 
MICKEY Do you think up these questions or the girl with no tongue? 
WAYNE No, Mickey, I can't let you get away with that shit. Answer the question. Was it worth it? You haven't seen, heard, or smelled Mallory in a year. Was it worth it? 
MICKEY Was an instant of purity worth a lifetime lie? Yeah, it was. 
WAYNE Excuse me, did you say an instant of purity? What was the instant of purity? The bodies you left behind on your bloody trail? 
MICKEY That's only part of it. I mean, it's a big, big, big part. But it's only the chorus, it's not the whole song. 
WAYNE (passionately) Please explain to me, Mickey, where's the purity that you couldn't live without in five year old Danny Millhouse's blown off head? Where's the purity in forty-eight people who are no longer on this planet because they met you and Mallory? What's so fucking pure about that? 
CAMERA ZOOMS in on Mickey's face. Mickey looks at Wayne, takes a slow drag off his cigarette. 
MICKEY Where the purity comes into play--- 
The image on the SCREEN starts to flutter, and then jams. 
WHITE LEADER fills the SCREEN. 
SCOTT (V.O.) Camera jam! I'm sorry Wayne. God. 
WAYNE (V.O.) Fucking dammit! Mickey hold onto that thought. Reload, quick! 
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY 
We're back to COLOR 35mm. 
WHITE LEADER FADES to reveal the wall of the holding cell. CAMERA pans onto Mallory on the floor, splashing water on her face from the holding cell toilet. The pain has started to subside. 
All wet, she lies down on the ground and sings: 
MALLORY (singing) Love is a hurtin' thang, and it leaves a fiery sting. 
SCOTT (V.O.) Okay. Okay, we're up again. 
WAYNE (V.O.) Roll it. Save the slate. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SUPPLY ROOM - DAY 
16MM - BLACK & WHITE 
We're looking through Scott's CAMERA again on a new roll of film. 
WAYNE You just said an instant of purity was preferrable to a lifetime lie. I don't understand. What's so pure about forty-eight dead bodies? 
MICKEY You'll never understand. Me and you, Wayne, we're not even the same species. I used to be you...then I evolved. From where you're standing, you're a man. From where I'm standing, you're a ape. I'm here...I'm right here... and you...you're somewhere else, man. You say why? I say why not?

BRANDON I gotta win one more game. 
TONI You can't fix this, Brandon. 
BRANDOn 
After Sunday's game I'm taking off... 
EXT. BROWNSTONE STEPS - NIGHT 
A cab pulls up.  BRANDON and TONI emerge.  BRANDON looks around as they start up the steps.  Both reach for their keys, regard one another. 
BRANDON It's still early.  Come in for a while. 
TONI I don't think so. 
She leans in to kiss him on the cheek and -- BRANDON suddenly shifts.  Their lips meet.  A casual goodbye suddenly grows in intensity as neither tries to part.  Seconds ticking by.  Things getting heated.  TONI tries to pull away. 
TONI Brandon-- 
BRANDON comes close, whispers something.  He unlocks the door. She hesitates before BRANDON takes her hand, leads her into his dark apartment and -- 
EXT. BROOKLYN BRIDGE - SAME TIME 
A cold wind blows off the river.  Whips through the cables of the span.  A match flares.  WALTER'S face is lit briefly by the flame.  He stands on the bridge walkway, looking down at the brownstone and -- 
DISSOLVE TO 
EXT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - DAY 
Gray, winter day.  View of a snow-covered window sill -- 
INT. WALTER AND TONI'S APARTMENT - DAY 
WALTER'S FACE fills a shaky HOME VIDEO VIEWFINDER, video coming close to show WALTER opening a book-size present -- removing a beautifully framed photo of TONI and JULIA. 
WALTER Look at that.  With the leaves and all.  This goes on my desk. 
Quick PAN to TONI -- sitting near the fireplace, fire blazing. 
TONI Happy anniversary. 
KNOCK at the door -- 
JULIA vo 
I'll get it. 
JULIA hands the CAMERA to WALTER.  VIDEO CAMERA view of JULIA and the puppy running to the door, opening it and -- 
JULIA Brandon! 
BRANDON Hey darlin'. 
Walter vo 
There he is.  C'mon in.  We're having a little celebration. Toni and I were married 12 years ago today. 
BRANDON Congratulations, I didn't know. 
WALTER vo 
Sit down.  I want you to be part of this. 
Okay angel, give Mommy my gift. 
WALTER aims the CAMERA as JULIA hands TONI a small gift box. TONI opens it, reveals a set of very expensive earrings. 
Toni 
Walter... 
WALTER vo 
Relax, I had some saved.  Put 'em on, lemme see. 
TONI puts the earrings on. 
Walter vo 
Beautiful.  God I got good taste. 
TONI stares into the CAMERA as WALTER PANS to BRANDON -- 
WALTER vo 
I saw something else, I couldn't help myself.  Here, Brandon -- for you. 
WALTER hands BRANDON a small black case.  BRANDON unsure, looks at TONI, opens it -- produces a very expensive watch. 
WALTER vo 
It's a Chopard.  Designed for car racing.  Guy won six times at LeMans wearing it.       Put it on, maybe you'll start winning.

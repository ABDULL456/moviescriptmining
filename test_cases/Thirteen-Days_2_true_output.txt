McNamara suffers under the gaze of everyone at the table, weighing the situation out.  And finally he ventures. 
MCNAMARA Six months ago we gamed out a scenario. It's slow.  It doesn't get rid of the missiles.  There are a lot of drawbacks. (beat) The scenario was for a blockade of Cuba. 
SUPER: THURSDAY, OCTOBER 18TH.  DAY 3 
INT. OVAL OFFICE - DAY 
Kenny enters the office from his side door in the middle of a debate.  Military uniforms dominate the room: General Taylor, General Sweeney, and a host of briefing officers. 
GENERAL TAYLOR The situation is worse than we thought. We count 40 missiles now, longer range IRBMs.  They can hit every city in the continental U.S. 
The President stares out the window at the Rose Garden, his back to Air Force Chief of Staff GENERAL CURTIS LEMAY, 60. Beetle-browed, arrogant, the archetypal Cold War general. Yet there is something about him, his intelligence perhaps, that suggests he's playing a role he knows and believes in. 
The only other civilians in the room are Bobby, Bundy and McNamara.  The pressure from the military is almost physical. 
LEMAY Mr. President, as of this moment my planes are ready to carry out the air strikes.  All you have to do is give me the word, sir, and my boys will get those Red bastards. 
The President continues staring out the window.  Kenny eases over to the desk, leans on it, arms folded, interposing himself between the President and the soldiers.  Bobby joins him, side-by-side. 
THE PRESIDENT How long until the army is ready? 
GENERAL TAYLOR We've just begun the mobilization under cover of a pre-arranged exercise, sir. We're looking at another week and a half, Mr. President. 
LEMAY But you can begin the strikes, now.  The plans call for an eight-day air campaign.  It'd light a fire under the army's ass to get in place. 
That makes the President turn around, stare at LeMay. 
THE PRESIDENT General LeMay, do you truly believe that's our best course of action? 
LEMAY Mr. President, I believe it is the only course of action.  American is in danger.  Those missiles are a threat to our bomber bases and the safety of our nuclear deterrent.  Without our deterrent, there's nothing to keep the enemy from choosing general nuclear war. It's our duty, our responsibility to the American people to take out those missiles and return stability to the strategic situation.  The Big Red Dog is digging in our back yard, and we're justified in shooting him. 
Taylor steps in softly, smoothly: good cop to LeMay's bad. 
GENERAL TAYLOR Sir, we have a rapidly closing window of opportunity where we can prevent those missiles from ever becoming operational. The other options... 
He spares a look at McNamara, who watches the fireworks, arms folded, serious. 
GENERAL TAYLOR (CONT'D) ...do not guarantee the end result we can guarantee.  However, the more time that goes by, the less reliable the choice we can offer you becomes. 
The President, partially defused, looks from Taylor to McNamara.  LeMay steps forward, softer now, sincere. 
LEMAY Mr. President, the motto I chose for SAC is 'Peace is our Profession.'  God forbid we find ourselves in a nuclear exchange.  But if launched, those missiles in Cuba would kill a lot of Americans.  That's why I'm being such a pain in the ass about destroying them. Destroying them immediately.  Hell, even Mac agrees. 
Bundy is uncomfortable.  Everyone turns to him.  He nods. Kenny realizes he's been co-opted by the military.  McNamara does too, lets out a deep breath.  The President eyes Bundy, then paces out from behind his desk, walks up to LeMay. 
THE PRESIDENT General, what will the Soviets do when we attack? 
LEMAY Nothing. 
Kenny, Bobby and the President look at each other, unable to believe what they just heard. 
THE PRESIDENT Nothing? 
LEMAY Nothing.  Because the only alternative open to them is one they can't choose. 
His pronouncement hangs there in the air: ominous, dangerous. 
THE PRESIDENT Those aren't just missiles we'll be destroying.  We kill Soviet soldiers, and they will respond.  How would we respond if they killed ours?  No, they will do something, General, I promise you that.  And I believe it'll be Berlin. 
INT. WEST WING HALLWAY - DAY 
LeMay walk out of the Oval Office with Taylor, Carter and their staffers. 
LEMAY Those goddamn Kennedys are going to destroy this country if we don't do something about this. 
There are dark looks on the faces of the other officers. They agree. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY 
As the meeting next door disperses, the President rummages through Kenny's jacket which hangs on Kenny's chair.  Kenny, bemused, holds out the package of cigarettes the President is looking for. 
KENNY I was hoping LeMay pushed you.  I wouldn't mind going a few rounds with him. 
The President glances up, takes the proffered smokes. 
THE PRESIDENT We knew it was coming.  I tell you, Kenny, these brass hats have one big advantage.  We do what they want us to, none of us will be alive to tell 'em they were wrong. 
Bobby, Rusk and Sorensen enter from the hall. 
SORENSEN Mr. President, Gromyko should be on his way by now. 
RUSK We need to go over what you're going to say. 
BOBBY There's still no sign they know that we know about the missiles.  Been a lot of cloud cover; probably think we aren't getting any good product. 
THE PRESIDENT We keep 'em in the dark as long as we can.  But I sure as hell am going to test him. 
INT. WEST WING HALL - DAY 
Kenny comes out of the bathroom, and is buttonholed by the crewcut, bullet-headed Press Secretary, PIERRE SALINGER, in the crowded, busy hallway. 
SALINGER Kenny, I'm getting funny questions from the guys in the press office.  As Press Secretary, I need to know.  What's going on? 
Kenny wheels back into his office.  It's filled with people. But he bends confidentially to Pierre's ear. 
KENNY They're planning to shave you bald next time you fall asleep on the bus. (off Pierre's get-serious look) Sorry, Pierre, Gromyko just arrived. 
INT. KENNY'S OFFICE - DAY

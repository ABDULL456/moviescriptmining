Truman waits alone, looking at the lone decoration: a campaign poster, showing a fat man in a suit grinning while holding a shotgun. Across the bottom it reads: WALK TALL WITH KRUTCH. A YOUNG PRISON GUARD sticks his head out of the office door. 
YOUNG PRISON GUARD Warden Krutch will see you now. 
INT. KSP, WARDEN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Wood-paneled walls, government-issue desk. On the wall behind the desk is a CHART -- a racial accounting of the current inmate population. It reads: WHITE - 1405, COLORED - 360, MEXICANS - 12, INDIANS - 6. 
WARDEN MARSHALL KRUTCH is fat, coarse, sweaty even in winter. And it's spring. He's running for Congress -- there are "KRUTCH FOR CONGRESS" bumper stickers laying around the office. He's enjoying a chance at a little publicity. The YOUNG PRISON GUARD stands quietly by the wall. 
KRUTCH We do well by our boys. Showers once a week. Feed em good. We'll be feeding Perry Smith in the infirmary soon if he don't eat. Get the food in through his arm. 
TRUMAN What are you talking about? 
KRUTCH Hasn't eaten in a month. But it's not his right to kill himself. It's the People's right. The People of this State. And that's who I work for, the People. You can write any of this down. 
TRUMAN No one told me. 
KRUTCH Yah. Won't eat. 
TRUMAN When can I see him? 
KRUTCH (checking desk calendar) How about you come back Thursday? 
TRUMAN No. That's no good. I need to see them now, then whenever I want for as long as I want. 
KRUTCH Not how we do things here. 
Pause. 
TRUMAN I see. 
Truman glances at the campaign stickers, the young prison guard, then back at Krutch. 
TRUMAN I understand what a burden unlimited visitation might be -- on this institution, and on the People who pay for it. I want to be clear that I don't expect the citizens of Leavenworth County to have to shoulder that burden. 
Truman reaches into his jacket, pulls from it an ENVELOPE STUFFED with CASH. He lays it on the desk. 
TRUMAN To be dispensed as you see fit. 
Krutch is stone-faced as he regards the money. Finally: 
KRUTCH I didn't know where to count your boy -- being half-Indian. I did him a favor though. (points to race chart) Counted him White. 
TRUMAN You're a kind and generous man. 
CUT TO: 
INT. KSP, DEATH ROW - DAY 
The second floor of a small building in the corner of the prison complex. Decrepit. The one hall is lit by mesh-covered BARE BULBS in the ceiling. Twelve cells -- six on each side. Each is 7 by 10 feet, with one small, high WINDOW covered by bars and wire. The YOUNG PRISON GUARD opens the heavy GATE at the end of the hall and shows Truman in. 
They walk down the row of cells. In one of them we notice Lowell Lee Andrews (20, white, spectacled, ENORMOUSLY FAT) peering at his own face 4 inches from a mirror. 
Dick is leaning against the bars of his own cell. He smiles. 
HICKOCK My hero. 
TRUMAN Hello. 
HICKOCK Thanks for your help with the lawyer. 
TRUMAN That's fine. 
HICKOCK You must be desperate for a story to come all the way out here. 
YOUNG PRISON GUARD Mr. Capote. You're entitled to go in. You may, um, go in. If you wish. 
Truman hesitates for a second. 
HICKOCK You want to see Perry. Go ahead. 
TRUMAN Thank you. 
Truman walks to the next cell. 
HICKOCK Ask me, he's just trying to prove the insanity defense.

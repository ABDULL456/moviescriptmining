{"train": "RETURN OF THE JEDI \nby Lawrence Kasdan George Lucas \nFrom The Novel by George Lucas \nThird Draft \nProperty of Lucasfilm Ltd. \nCompletion Date December 1, 1981 \n1    SPACE \nThe boundless heavens serve as a back-drop for the MAIN TITLE, followed by a ROLL-UP, which crawls into infinity. \nEpisode VI RETURN OF THE JEDI \nLuke Skywalker has returned to his home planet of Tatooine in an attempt to rescue his friend Han Solo from the clutches of the\u00cavile gangster Jabba the Hutt. Little does Luke know that the GALACTIC EMPIRE has secretly begun construction on a new armored space station even more powerful than the first dreaded Death Star. When completed, this ultimate weapon will spell certain doom for the small band of Rebels struggling to restore freedom to the galaxy... \nPAN DOWN to reveal a monstrous half-completed Death Star, its massive superstructure curling away from the completed section like the arms of a giant octopus. Beyond, in benevolent contrast, floats the small, green moon of ENDOR. \nAn Imperial Star Destroyer moves overhead toward the massive armored space station, followed by two zipping TIE fighters. A small Imperial shuttle rockets from the main bay of the ship and hustles toward the Death Star. \n2    INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT The shuttle captain makes contact with the Death Star. \nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN Command station, this is ST 321. Code Clearance Blue. We're starting our approach. Deactivate the security shield. \nDEATH STAR CONTROLLER\t(filtered VO) The security deflector shield will be deactivated when we have confirmation of your code transmission. Stand by... You are clear to proceed. \nSHUTTLE CAPTAIN We're starting our approach. \n3    INT DEATH STAR - CONTROL ROOM \nOperators move about among the control panels. A SHIELD OPERATOR hits switches beside a large screen, on which is a display of the Death Star, the moon Endor, and a bright web delineating the invisible deflector shield. \nA control officer rushes over to the shield operator. \nOFFICER Inform the commander that Lord Vader's shuttle has arrived. \nOPERATOR Yes, sir. \nThe control officer moves to a view port and watches as the Imperial shuttle lands in the massive docking bay. A squad of Imperial stormtroopers moves into formation before the craft. \n4    INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY \nThe DEATH STAR COMMANDER, MOFF JERJERROD, a tall, confident technocrat, strides through the assembled troops to the base of the shuttle ramp. The troops snap to attention; many are uneasy about the new arrival. But the Death Star commander stands arrogantly tall. \nThe exit hatch of the shuttle opens with a WHOOSH, revealing only darkness. Then, heavy FOOTSTEPS AND MECHANICAL BREATHING. From this black void appears DARTH VADER, LORD OF THE SITH. Vader looks over the assemblage as he walks down the ramp. \nJERJERROD Lord Vader, this is an unexpected pleasure. We're honored by your presence. \nVADER You may dispense with the pleasantries, Commander. I'm here to put you back on schedule. \nThe commander turns ashen and begins to shake. \nJERJERROD I assure you, Lord Vader, my men are working as fast as they can. \nVADER Perhaps I can find new ways to motivate them. \nJERJERROD I tell you, this station will be operational as planned. \nVADER The Emperor does not share your optimistic appraisal of the situation. \nJERJERROD But he asks the impossible. I need more men. \nVADER Then perhaps you can tell him when he arrives. \nBib shakes his head negatively. \nBIB Nee Jabba no badda. Me chaade su goodie. \nBib holds out his hand toward Artoo and the tiny droid backs up a bit, letting out a protesting array of squeaks. Threepio turns to the strange-looking alien. \nTHREEPIO He says that our instructions are to give it only to Jabba himself. \nBib thinks about this for a moment. \nTHREEPIO I'm terribly sorry. I'm afraid he's ever so stubborn about these sort of things. \nBib gestures for the droids to follow. \nBIB Nudd Chaa. \nThe droids follow the tall, tentacled alien into the darkness, trailed by the two guards. \nTHREEPIO Artoo, I have a bad feeling about this. \n8    INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM \nThe throne room is filled with the vilest, most grotesque CREATURES ever conceived in the universe. Artoo and Threepio seem very small as they pause in the doorway to the dimly lit chamber. Light shafts partially illuminate the drunken courtiers as Bib Fortuna crosses the room to the platform upon which rests the leader of this nauseating crowd: JABBA THE HUTT. The monarch of the galactic underworld is a repulsive blob of bloated fat with a maniacal grin. Chained to the horrible creature is the beautiful alien female dancer named OOLA. At the foot of the dais sits an obnoxious birdlike creature, SALACIOUS CRUMB. Bib whispers something in the slobbering degenerate's ear. Jabba laughs horribly, at the two terrified droids before him. Threepio bows politely. \nTHREEPIO Good morning. \nJABBA Bo Shuda! \nThe robots jump forward to stand before the repulsive, loose-skinned villain. \nTHREEPIO The message, Artoo, the message. \nArtoo whistles, and a beam of light projects from his domed head, creating a hologram of LUKE on the floor. The image grows to over ten feet tall, and the young Jedi towers over the space gangsters. \nLUKE Greetings, Exalted One. Allow me to introduce myself. I am Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight and friend to Captain Solo. I know that you are powerful, mighty Jabba, and that your anger with Solo must be equally powerful. I seek an audience with Your Greatness to bargain for Solo's life. (Jabba's crowd laughs) With your wisdom, I'm sure that we can work out an arrangement which will be mutually beneficial and enable us to avoid any unpleasant confrontation. As a token of my goodwill, I present to you a gift: these two droids. \nThreepio is startled by this announcement. \nTHREEPIO What did he say? \nLUKE\t (cont) ... Both are hardworking and will serve you well. \nTHREEPIO This can't be! Artoo, you're playing the wrong message. \nLuke's hologram disappears. \nJabba laughs while Bib speaks to him in Huttese. \nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled) There will be no bargain. \nTHREEPIO We're doomed. \nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled) I will not give up my favorite decoration. I like Captain Solo where he is. \nJabba laughs hideously and looks toward an alcove beside the throne. Hanging high, flat against the wall, exactly as we saw him last, is a carbonized HAN SOLO. \nTHREEPIO Artoo, look! Captain Solo. And he's still frozen in carbonite. \n9    INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR \nOne of Jabba's Gamorrean guards marches Artoo and Threepio down a dank, shadowy passageway lined with holding cells. The cries of unspeakable creatures bounce off the cold stone walls. Occasionally a repulsive arm or tentacle grabs through the bars at the hapless droids. Artoo beeps pitifully. \nTHREEPIO What could possibly have come over Master Luke. Is it something I did? He never expressed any unhappiness with my work. Oh! Oh! Hold it! Ohh! \nA large tentacle wraps around Threepio's neck. He manages to break free, and they move on to a door at the end of the corridor. \n10   INT BOILER ROOM \nJabba immediately flies into a rage, knocking the golden droid off the raised throne into a clattering heap on the floor. Boushh adjusts his weapon as Jabba raves in Huttese and Threepio struggles back onto the throne. The disheveled droid tries to compose himself. \nTHREEPIO Uh, oh... but what, what did I say? (to Boushh) Uh, the mighty Jabba asks why he must pay fifty thousand. \nThe bounty hunter holds up a small silver ball in his hand. Threepio looks at it, then looks at Jabba, then back to the bounty hunter. The droid is very nervous and Jabba is getting very impatient. \nTHREEPIO Because he's holding a thermal detonator. \nThe guards instantly back away, as do most of the other monsters in the room. Jabba stares at the silver ball, which begins to glow in the bounty hunter's hand. The room has fallen into a tense hush. Jabba stares at the bounty hunter malevolently until a sly grin creeps across his vast mouth and he begins to laugh. \nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled) This bounty hunter is my kind of scum. Fearless and inventive. \nJabba continues. \nTHREEPIO Jabba offers the sum of thirty-five. And I suggest you take it. \nBib and the other monsters study the bounty hunter and wait for his reaction. Boushh releases a switch on the thermal detonator and it goes dead. \nBOUSHH Zeebuss. \nTHREEPIO He agrees! \nThe raucous crowd of monsters erupts in a symphony of cheers and applause as the party returns to its full noisy pitch. Chewbacca growls. As he is led away we spot LANDO CALRISSIAN, disguised as a skiff guard in a partial face mask. The band starts up and dancing girls take the center of the floor, to the hoots of the loudly appreciative creatures. \nBoushh leans against a column with gunfighter cool and surveys the scene, his gaze stopping only when it connects with a glare from across the room. Boba Fett is watching him. Boushh shifts slightly, cradling his weapon lovingly. Boba Fett shifts with equally ominous arrogance. \n12   INT DUNGEON CORRIDOR AND CELL \nGamorrean guards lead Chewie down the same hallway we saw before. When a tentacle reaches out at the Wookiee, Chewie's ferocious ROAR echoes against the walls and the tentacle snaps back into its cell in terror. It takes all the guards to hurl Chewie roughly into a cell, slamming the door behind him. Chewie lets out a pathetic howl and bangs on the iron door. \n13   EXT JABBA'S PALACE \nThe palace is sitting in the light of the double sunset. On the road in front, a large toadlike creature flicks its tongue out for a desert rodent and burps in satisfaction. \n14   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM - NIGHT \nSilence. The room is deserted, only the awful debris of the alien celebration giving mute witness to the activity here before. Several drunk creatures lie unconscious around the room, snoring loudly. \nA shadowy figure moves stealthily among the columns at the perimeter of the room and is revealed to be Boushh, the bounty hunter. He picks his way carefully through the snoring, drunken monsters. \nHan Solo, the frozen space pirate, hangs spotlighted on the wall, his coffin-like case suspended by a force field. The bounty hunter deactivates the force field by flipping a control switch to one side of the coffin. The heavy case slowly lowers to the floor of the alcove. \nBoushh steps up to the case, studying Han, and then turns to the controls on the side of the coffin. He activates a series of switches and, after one last hesitant look at Han, slides the de-carbonization lever. The case begins to emit a sound as the hard shell covering the contours of Han's face begins to melt away. The bounty hunter watches as Han's body is freed of its metallic coat and his forearms and hands, previously raised in reflexive protest, drop slackly to his side. His face muscles relax from their mask of horror. He appears quite dead. \nBoushh's ugly helmet leans close to Han's face listening for the breath of life. Nothing. He waits. Han's eyes pop open with a start and he begins coughing. The bounty hunter steadies the staggering newborn. \nBOUSHH Just relax for a moment. You're free of the carbonite. \nHan touches his face with his hand and moans. \nBOUSHH Shhh. You have hibernation sickness. \nHAN I can't see. \nBOUSHH Your eyesight will return in time. \nHAN Where am I? \nBOUSHH Jabba's palace. \nHAN Who are you? \nThe bounty hunter reaches up and lifts the helmet from his head, revealing the beautiful face of PRINCESS LEIA. \nLEIA Someone who loves you. \nHAN Leia! \nLuke raises his hand and points at the puzzled guards, who immediately lower their spears and fall back. The young Jedi lowers his hand and moves on down the hallway. \nBib Fortuna appears out of the gloom. He speaks to Luke as they approach each other, but Luke doesn't stop and Bib must reverse his direction and hurry alongside the young Jedi in order to carry on the conversation. Several other guards fall in behind them in the darkness. \nLUKE I must speak with Jabba. \nBib answers in Huttese, shaking his head in denial. Luke stops and stares at Bib; he raises his hand slightly. \nLUKE You will take me to Jabba now! \nBib turns in hypnotic response to Luke's command, and Luke follows him into the gloom. \nLUKE You serve your master well. \nBib responds. \nLUKE And you will be rewarded. \n17   INT JABBA'S THRONE ROOM \nJabba is asleep on his throne, with Leia lying in front of him. Salacious sits by Jabba's tail, watching it wriggle. Leia is now dressed in the skimpy costume of a dancing girl; a chain runs from a manacle/necklace at her throat to her new master, Jabba the Hutt. Threepio stands behind Jabba as Bib comes up to the gangster slug. \nTHREEPIO At last! Master Luke's come to rescue me. \nBIB Master. \nJabba awakens with a start and Bib continues, in Huttese. \nBIB ...Luke Skywalker, Jedi Knight. \nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled) I told you not to admit him. \nLUKE I must be allowed to speak. \nBIB\t (in Huttese subtitled) He must be allowed to speak. \nJabba, furious, clobbers Bib and shoves him away. \nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled) You weak-minded fool! He's using an old Jedi mind trick. \nLuke stares hard at Jabba. \nLUKE You will bring Captain Solo and the Wookiee to me. \nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled) Your mind powers will not work on me, boy. \nLUKE Nevertheless, I'm taking Captain Solo and his friends. You can either profit by this... or be destroyed! It's your choice. But I warn you not to underestimate my powers. \nJabba's laugh is mean and loud. Threepio attempts to warn Luke about the pit. \nTHREEPIO Master Luke, you're standing on... \nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled) There will be no bargain, young Jedi. I shall enjoy watching you die. \nLuke reaches out, and a pistol jumps out of a guard's holster and flies into Luke's hand. The bewildered guard grabs for it as Jabba raises his hand. \nJABBA Bascka! \nThe floor suddenly drops away, sending Luke and the hapless guard into the pit. The pistol goes off, blasting a hole in the ceiling. Jabba laughs and his courtiers join in. Leia starts forward but is restrained by a human guard-- Lando, recognizable behind his mask. She looks at him and he shakes his head \"no.\" \n18   INT RANCOR PIT \nLuke and the guard have dropped twenty-five feet from a chute into the dungeonlike cage. Luke gets to his feet as the guard yells hysterically for help. A crowd gathers up around the edge of the pit as the door in the side of the pit starts to RUMBLE open. The guard screams in panic. Luke looks calmly around for a means of escape. \nTHREEPIO Oh, no! The Rancor! \nAt the side of the pit, an iron door rumbles upward and a giant, fanged RANCOR emerges. The guard runs to the side of the pit and tries futilely to scramble to the top. The hideous beast closes in on him. \n23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF \nJabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by two smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke, Han, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is Lando in disguise. \nHAN I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. \nLUKE There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. \nHAN You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. \nLUKE Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. \nHAN Oh... great! \n24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK \nJabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. Leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to her neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to him. \nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled) Soon you will learn to appreciate me. \nThreepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles. \nTHREEPIO Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? \nArtoo beeps a quick reply. \nTHREEPIO Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! \nArtoo whistles a singsong response. \nTHREEPIO Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence. \n25   EXT SARLACC PIT \nThe convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth. \n26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK \nJabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across loudspeakers. \nTHREEPIO Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas. \n27   EXT SKIFF \nHan steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak. \nHAN Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? \nChewie growls his agreement. \nLUKE Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. \nLando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look of conspiracy to him. \n28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK \nThe assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as he speaks into the comlink. \nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled) Move him into position. \nJabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried. \n29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK \nArtoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap opens in Artoo's domed head. \nJABBA\t (in Huttese subtitled) Put him in. \nLEIA He means \"You're welcome.\" \nLANDO Come on, let's get off this miserable dust ball. \n44A  EXT SPACE ABOVE TATOOINE \nThe desolate yellow planet fills the screen, Luke's X-wing appears and peels off to the left. A moment later, the FALCON appears as a dot and grows huge, to roar directly over the CAMERA. \n45   INT X-WING - COCKPIT \nLuke is at the controls, with Artoo attached behind him outside the canopy. Luke speaks into his comlink to the others, in the MILLENNIUM FALCON. \nLUKE I'll meet you back at the fleet. \nLEIA\t (over comlink) Hurry. The Alliance should be assembled by now. \nLUKE I will. \nHAN\t (over comlink) Hey, Luke, thanks. Thanks for comin' after me. Now I owe you one. \nA message from Artoo appears on the small monitor screen in front of Luke. He smiles at the monitor and speaks to Artoo, as he pulls a black glove on to cover his wounded mechanical hand. \nLUKE That's right, Artoo. We're going to the Dagobah system. I have a promise to keep... to an old friend. \n46   EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR AND ENDOR \nA Super Star Destroyer and several ships of the Imperial Fleet rest in space above the half-completed Death Star and its green neighbor, Endor. Four squads of TIE fighters escort an Imperial shuttle toward the Death Star. \n47   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO DOCKING BAY \nLord Vader strides down the hallway, accompanied by a very nervous Death Star commander. \n48   INT DOCKING BAY - DEATH STAR \nThousands of Imperial troops in tight formation fill the mammoth docking bay. Vader and the officer walk to the landing platform, where the shuttle is coming to rest. \nThe shuttle's ramp lowers and the Emperor's Royal Guards come out and create a lethal perimeter. The assembled troops move to rigid attention with a momentous SNAP. \nThen, in the huge SILENCE which follows, the EMPEROR appears. He is a rather small, shriveled old man. His bent frame slowly makes its way down the ramp with the aid of a gnarled cane. He wears a hooded cloak similar to the one Ben wears, except that it is black. The Emperor's face is shrouded and difficult to see, except for his piercing yellow eyes. Commander Jerjerrod and Darth Vader kneel to him. The Supreme Ruler of the galaxy beckons to the Dark Lord. \nEMPEROR\t (to Vader) Rise, my friend. \nVader rises and falls in next to the Emperor as he slowly makes his way along the rows of troops. Jerjerrod and the other commanders stay kneeling until the Supreme Ruler and Vader, followed by several Imperial dignitaries, pass by; only then do they join in the procession. \nVADER The Death Star will be completed on schedule. \nEMPEROR You have done well, Lord Vader. And now I sense you wish to continue your search for young Skywalker. \nVADER Yes, my Master. \nEMPEROR Patience, my friend. In time he will seek you out. And when he does, you must bring him before me. He has grown strong. Only together can we turn him to the dark side of the Force. \nVADER As you wish. \nEMPEROR Everything is proceeding as I have foreseen. \nHe laughs to himself as they pass along the vast line of Imperial troops. \n49   EXT YODA'S HOUSE - DAGOBAH \nOnce again, Artoo finds himself waiting around in the damp environs of the swamp planet, and he's none too happy about it. He beeps disconsolately to himself and turns to look at Yoda's cottage. Warm yellow light escapes the oddly shaped windows to fight the gloom. \n50   INT YODA'S HOUSE \nThe tip of a walking stick taps hesitantly across the earthen floor of the cottage. Our view travels up the stick to the small green hand that clutches it, and then to the familiar face of YODA, THE JEDI MASTER. His manner is frail, and his voice, though cheerful, seems weaker. \nYODA Hmm. That face you make. Look I so old to young eyes? \nLuke wanders back to where his ship is sitting. Artoo beeps a greeting, but is ignored by his depressed master. Luke kneels down, begins to help Artoo with the ship, then stops and shakes his head dejectedly. \nLUKE I can't do it, Artoo. I can't go on alone. \nBEN\t (OS) Yoda will always be with you. \nLuke looks up to see the shimmering image of BEN KENOBI. \nLUKE Obi-Wan! Why didn't you tell me? \nThe ghost of Ben Kenobi approaches him through the swamp. \nLUKE You told me Vader betrayed and murdered my father. \nBEN You father was seduced by the dark side of the Force. He ceased to be Anakin Skywalker and became Darth Vader. When that happened, the good man who was your father was destroyed. So what I have told you was true... from a certain point of view. \nLUKE\t (turning away, derisive) A certain point of view! \nBEN Luke, you're going to find that many of the truths we cling to depend greatly on our own point of view. \nLuke is unresponsive. Ben studies him in silence for a moment. \nBEN I don't blame you for being angry. If I was wrong in what I did, it certainly wouldn't have been for the first time. You see, what happened to your father was my fault. \nBen pauses sadly. \nBEN Anakin was a good friend. \nLuke turns with interest at this. As Ben speaks, Luke settles on a stump, mesmerized. Artoo comes over to offer his comforting presence. \nBEN When I first knew him, your father was already a great pilot. But I was amazed how strongly the Force was with him. I took it upon myself to train him as a Jedi. I thought that I could instruct him just as well as Yoda. I was wrong. My pride has had terrible consequences for the galaxy. \nLuke is entranced. \nLUKE There's still good in him. \nBEN I also thought he could be turned back to the good side. It couldn't be done. He is more machine now than man. Twisted and evil. \nLUKE I can't do it, Ben. \nBEN You cannot escape your destiny. \nLUKE I tried to stop him once. I couldn't do it. \nBEN Vader humbled you when first you met him, Luke... but that experience was part of your training. It taught you, among other things, the value of patience. Had you not been so impatient to defeat Vader then, you could have finished your training here with Yoda. You would have been prepared. \nLUKE But I had to help my friends. \nBEN\t (grinning at Luke's indignation) And did you help them? It was they who had to save you. You achieved little by rushing back prematurely, I fear. \nLUKE\t (with sadness) I found out Darth Vader was my father. \nBEN To be a Jedi, Luke, you must confront and then go beyond the dark side - the side your father couldn't get past. Impatience is the easiest door - for you, like your father. Only, your father was seduced by what he found on the other side of the door, and you have held firm. You're no longer so reckless now, Luke. You are strong and patient. And now, you must face Darth Vader again! \nLUKE I can't kill my own father. \nBEN Then the Emperor has already won. You were our only hope. \nLUKE Yoda spoke of another. \nBEN The other he spoke of is your twin sister. \nLUKE But I have no sister. \nBEN Hmm. To protect you both from the Emperor, you were hidden from your father when you were born. The Emperor knew, as I did, if Anakin were to have any offspring, they would be a threat to him. That is the reason why your sister remains safely anonymous. \nLUKE Leia! Leia's my sister. \nMadine moves center stage. \nGENERAL MADINE We have stolen a small Imperial shuttle. Disguised as a cargo ship, and using a secret Imperial code, a strike team will land on the moon and deactivate the shield generator. \nThe assembly begins to mumble among themselves. \nTHREEPIO Sounds dangerous. \nLEIA\t (to Han) I wonder who they found to pull that off. \nGENERAL MADINE General Solo, is your strike team assembled? \nLeia, startled, looks up at Han, surprise changing to admiration. \nHAN Uh, my team's ready. I don't have a command crew for the shuttle. \nChewbacca raises his hairy paw and volunteers.  Han looks up at him. \nHAN Well, it's gonna be rough, pal. I didn't want to speak for you. \nChewie waves that off with a huge GROWL. \nHAN\t (smiles) That's one. \nLEIA Uh, General... count me in. \nVOICE\t (OS) I'm with you, too! \nThey turn in that direction and peer into the crowd as there are more cheers. The commanders part, and there at the back stands Luke. Han and Leia are surprised and delighted. \nLeia moves to Luke and embraces him warmly. She senses a change in him and looks into his eyes questioningly. \nLEIA What is it? \nLUKE\t (hesitant) Ask me again sometime. \nHan, Chewie, and Lando crowd around Luke as the assembly breaks up. \nHAN Luke. \nLUKE Hi, Han... Chewie. \nArtoo beeps a singsong observation to a worried Threepio. \nTHREEPIO \"Exciting\" is hardly the word I would use. \n54   INT HEADQUARTERS FRIGATE - MAIN DOCKING BAY \nThe Millennium Falcon rests beyond the stolen IMPERIAL SHUTTLE, which looks anomalous among all the Rebel ships in the vast docking bay. Chewie barks a final farewell to Lando and leads Artoo and Threepio up the shuttle, crowded now with the Rebel strike team loading weapons and supplies. Lando turns to face Han. Luke and Leia have said their good- byes and start up the ramp. \nHAN Look. I want you to take her. I mean it. Take her. You need all the help you can get. She's the fastest ship in the fleet. \nLANDO All right, old buddy. You know, I know what she means to you. I'll take good care of her. She-she won't get a scratch. All right? \nHAN\t (looks at him warmly) Right. I got your promise now. Not a scratch. \nLANDO Look, would you get going, you pirate. \nHan and Lando pause, then exchange salutes. \nLANDO Good luck. \nHAN You, too. \nHan goes up the ramp. Lando watches him go and then slowly turns away. \n55   INT IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT \nLUKE Get him! \nThe speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a glancing hit. \nLUKE\t (indicating the one ahead) Keep on that one! I'll take these two! \nWith Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk. \nThe scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail. \nFAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and rises out of sight. \nThe scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes a glancing hit. \nLeia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a conflagration. \nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are moving as one. \nAnother big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find Luke. \nLuke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire. \n66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST \nHan, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait anxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps. \nTHREEPIO Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! \nHan, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons. \nLuke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around. \nHAN Luke! Where's Leia? \nLUKE\t (concerned) What? She didn't come back? \nHAN I thought she was with you. \nLUKE We got separated. \nLuke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily. \nLUKE Hey, we better go look for her. \nHan nods, and signals to a Rebel officer. \nHAN Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. \nLUKE Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners. \nLuke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the squad proceeds in another. \nTHREEPIO Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do. \nThey move off into the woods. \nTHREEPIO\t (to Artoo) And you said it was pretty here. Ugh! \n67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE \nA strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where she is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and disheveled. \nThe Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins poking her with the sharp point of the spear. \nLEIA Cut it out! \nShe stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away. \nEMPEROR\t (very cool) Are you sure? \nVADER I have felt him, my Master. \nEMPEROR Strange, that I have not. I wonder if your feelings on this matter are clear, Lord Vader. \nVader knows what is being asked. \nVADER They are clear, my Master. \nEMPEROR Then you must go to the Sanctuary Moon and wait for them. \nVADER\t (skeptical) He will come to me? \nEMPEROR I have foreseen it. His compassion for you will be his undoing. He will come to you and then you will bring him before me. \nVADER\t (bows) As you wish. \nThe Dark Lord strides out of the throne room. \n70   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE \nHan, Luke, Chewie, and the two droids are spread out as they move through the heavy foliage near the clearing where we last saw Leia. Luke finds Leia's helmet, picks it up with an expression of concern. \nHAN\t (OS) Luke! Luke! \nLuke runs with the helmet to where Han has found the charred wreckage of a speeder bike in the grass. \nTHREEPIO Oh, Master Luke. \nLUKE There's two more wrecked speeders back there. And I found this. \nHe tosses the helmet to Han. \nTHREEPIO I'm afraid that Artoo's sensors can find no trace of Princess Leia. \nHAN\t (gravely) I hope she's alright. \nChewbacca growls, sniffing the air, then, with a bark, pushes off through the foliage. \nHAN What, Chewie? What? Chewie! \nThe others rush to keep up with the giant Wookiee. As he scoots along, Artoo whistles nervously. \n71   EXT FOREST - DENSE FOLIAGE \nThe group has reached a break in the undergrowth. Chewie walks up to a tall stake planted in the ground. There is a dead animal hanging from it. \nHAN Hey, I don't get it. \nThe rest of the group joins the Wookiee around the stake. \nHAN\t (cont) Nah, it's just a dead animal, Chewie. \nChewie can't resist. He reaches toward the meat. \nLUKE Chewie, wa-wait!  Don't! \nToo late. The Wookiee has already pulled the animal from the stake. SPROOING! The group finds itself hanging upside down in an Ewok net, suspended high above the clearing. Artoo lets out a wild series of beeps and whistles, and Chewie howls his regret. Their bodies are a jumble in the net. Han removes a Wookiee paw from his mouth. \nHAN Nice work. Great, Chewie! Great! Always thinking with your stomach. \nLUKE Will you take it easy? Let's just figure out a way to get out of this thing. (trying to free an arm) Han, can you reach my lightsaber? \nHAN Yeah, sure. \nArtoo is at the bottommost point in the net. He extends his cutting appendage and begins slicing at the net. Han is trying to squeeze an arm past Threepio to get at Luke's lightsaber. The net continues to spin. \nSuddenly all activity stops as LOGRAY, the tribal Medicine Man, comes out of the big hut. He examines the captives carefully, goes to join Threepio, whose throne has been placed on an elevated platform. A larger, gray-haired Ewok, CHIEF CHIRPA, is examining Luke's lightsaber with great curiosity. \nLogray speaks to Threepio and the assemblage of fuzzy Ewoks, pointing to the prisoners tied to the stakes. The Ewoks begin filling the pit under Han with firewood. \nHAN What did he say? \nTHREEPIO I'm rather embarrassed, General Solo, but it appears you are to be the main course at a banquet in my honor. \nThe drums start beating, and all the furry heads turn to the large hut. Leia emerges, wearing an animal-skin dress. She sees what's happening at the same moment the prisoners see her. \nHAN and LUKE Leia! \nAs she moves toward them, the Ewoks block her way with raised spears. \nLEIA Oh! \nTHREEPIO Your Royal Highness. \nArtoo and Chewie chime in with their welcome. Leia looks at the assembled Ewoks and sighs. \nLEIA But these are my friends. Threepio, tell them they must be set free. \nThreepio talks to Chirpa and Logray, who listen and shake their heads negatively. The Medicine Man gestures toward the prisoners and barks some orders. Several Ewoks jump up and pile more wood on the barbecue with vigor. Leia trades frantic looks with Luke and Han . \nHAN Somehow, I got the feeling that didn't help us very much. \nLUKE Threepio, tell them if they don't do as you wish, you'll become angry and use your magic. \nTHREEPIO But Master Luke, what magic? I couldn't possibly -- \nLUKE Just tell them. \nThreepio speaks to the Ewoks. The Ewoks are disturbed. Logray steps forward and challenges Threepio. Luke closes his eyes and begins to concentrate. \nTHREEPIO You see, Master Luke; they didn't believe me. Just... \nNow the litter/throne, with Threepio sitting upon it, rises from the ground. At first Threepio doesn't notice and keeps talking. \nTHREEPIO ... as I said they wouldn't. Wha-wha-what's happening! Oh! Oh, dear! Oh! \nThe Ewoks fall back in terror from the floating throne. Now Threepio begins to spin as though he were on a revolving stool, with Threepio calling out in total panic at his situation. \nTHREEPIO Put me down! He-e-elp! Master Luke! Artoo! Somebody, somebody, help! Master Luke, Artoo! Artoo, quickly! Do something, somebody! Oh! Ohhh! \nChief Chirpa yells orders to the cowering Ewoks. They rush up and release the bound prisoners. Luke and Han enfold Leia in a group embrace. Luke notices the spinning Threepio, with Artoo beeping up at him, and slowly lowers the golden droid and the throne to the ground. Logray orders the little droid cut down. Artoo crashes to the ground. When the Ewoks set him upright, the little droid is fighting mad. Artoo beeps a blue streak at the nearest Ewok, and begins pursuing him, finally getting close enough to zap him with an electric charge. The Ewok jumps two feet in the air and runs away, screaming. A small group of Ewoks surround the giant Wookiee, scratching their heads and marveling at his height. \nTHREEPIO Oh, oh, oh, oh! Thank goodness. \nLUKE Thanks, Threepio. \nTHREEPIO\t (still shaken) I...I never knew I had it in me. \n75   INT CHIEF'S HUT - COUNCIL OF ELDERS \nA glowing fire dances in the center of the spartan, low-ceilinged room, creating a kaleidoscope of shadows on the walls. Along one side, a group of ten Ewok elders flank Chief Chirpa, who sits on his throne. The Rebels sit along the walls of the hut, with Threepio between the two groups and Wicket and Teebo off to one side. \nThreepio is in the midst of a long, animated speech in the Ewok's squeaky native tongue. The Ewoks listen carefully and occasionally murmur comments to each other. Threepio points several times at the Rebel group and pantomimes a short history of the Galactic Civil War, mimicking the explosion and rocket sounds, imitating Imperial walkers. Throughout the long account, certain familiar names are distinguishable in English: Princess Leia, Artoo, Darth Vader, Death Star, Jedi, Obi- Wan Kenobi. Artoo begins beeping excitedly at Threepio. \nTHREEPIO Yes, Artoo. I was just coming to that. \nThreepio continues with: Millennium Falcon, Cloud City, Vader, Han Solo, carbonite, Sarlacc, bringing the history up to the present time. \nAt the end of it, the Chief, Logray, and the elders confer, then nod in agreement. The Chief stands and makes a pronouncement. \nThe drums begin to sound, and all the Ewoks stand with a great cheer and screeches. \nHAN What's going on? \nLeia is very disturbed by this. She moves away, as if to deny it. \nLEIA Luke, don't talk that way. You have a power I--I don't understand and could never have. \nLUKE You're wrong, Leia. You have that power too. In time you'll learn to use it as I have. The Force is strong in my family. My father has it...I have it...and...my sister has it. \nLeia stares into his eyes. What she sees there frightens her. But she doesn't draw away. She begins to understand. \nLUKE Yes. It's you Leia. \nLEIA I know. Somehow...I've always known. \nLUKE Then you know why I have to face him. \nLEIA No! Luke, run away, far away. If he can feel your presence, then leave this place. I wish I could go with you. \nLUKE No, you don't. You've always been strong. \nLEIA But, why must you confront him? \nLUKE Because...there is good in him. I've felt it. He won't turn me over to the Emperor. I can save him. I can turn him back to the good side. I have to try. \nThey hold each other close and look at each other, brother and sister. \nLeia holds back her tears as Luke slowly lets her go and moves away. He disappears onto the walkway that leads out of the village. Leia, bathed in moonlight, watches him go as Han comes out of the Chief's hut and comes over to her. Leia is crying, her body trembling. He realizes only now that she is crying. \nHAN Hey, what's goin' on? \nLeia attempts to stifle her sobs and wipes her eyes. \nLEIA Nothing. I - just want to be alone for a little while. \nHAN\t (angry) Nothing?  Come on, tell me.  What's goin' on? \nShe looks up at him, struggling to control herself. \nLEIA I...I can't tell you. \nHAN\t (loses his temper) Did you tell Luke? Is that who you could tell? \nLEIA I... \nHAN Ahhh... \nHe starts to walk away, exasperated, then stops and walks back to her. \nHAN I'm sorry. \nLEIA Hold me. \nHan gathers her tightly in his protective embrace. \n77   EXT FOREST - IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM \nAn Imperial shuttle floats down from the Death Star and lands gracefully on the huge platform. \nNow, an Imperial walker approaches the platform from the darkness of the forest. The whole outpost - platform, walkers, military - looks particularly offensive in the midst of this verdant beauty. \n78   EXT IMPERIAL LANDING PLATFORM - LOWER DECK \nDarth Vader walks down the ramp of the shuttle onto the platform, into an elevator, and appears on a ramp on a lower level. He walks toward another ramp exit and is met by two troopers and a commander with Luke, in binders, at their center. The young Jedi gazes at Vader with complete calm. \nCOMMANDER This is a Rebel that surrendered to us. Although he denies it, I believe there may be more of them, and I request permission to conduct a further search of the area. \nThe commander extends his hand, revealing Luke's lightsaber. \nCOMMANDER He was armed only with this. \n81   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nLando is in the pilot seat. His alien copilot, NIEN NUNB, takes some getting used to in the familiar environs of the Falcon's cockpit. Lando speaks into his comlink. \nLANDO Admiral, we're in position. All fighters accounted for. \nACKBAR \t(VO) Proceed with the countdown. All groups assume attack coordinates. \nLando turns to his weird copilot. \nLANDO Don't worry, my friends are down there. They'll have that shield down on time... (to himself) or this'll be the shortest offensive of all time. \nThe copilot flips some switches and grunts an alien comment. \nACKBAR\t (VO) All craft, prepare to jump to hyperspace on my mark. \nLANDO All right. Stand by. \nHe pulls a lever, and the stars outside begin to streak. \n82   EXT SPACE - REBEL FLEET \nWe are treated to an awesome sight: first the Millennium Falcon, then Ackbar's Star Cruiser, then, in large segments, the huge fleet ROARS INTO HYPERSPACE. And disappears. \n83   EXT ENDOR - RIDGE OVERLOOKING CONTROL BUNKER \nHan, Leia, Chewie, the droids, and their two Ewok guides, Wicket and Paploo, have reunited with the Rebel strike squad. The entire group is spread through the thick undergrowth. Below them is the BUNKER that leads into the generator. Four Imperial scouts, their speeder bikes parked nearby, keep watch over the bunker entrance. Chewie growls an observation, and Paploo chatters away to Han in Ewok language. \nHAN Back door, huh? Good idea. \nWicket and Paploo continue their Ewok conversation. \nHAN\t (cont) It's only a few guards. This shouldn't be too much trouble. \nLEIA Well, it only takes one to sound the alarm. \nHAN\t (with self-confident grin) Then we'll do it real quiet-like. \nThreepio explains what is going on to Wicket and Paploo. The Ewoks chatter a moment between themselves. Then Paploo jumps up and scampers into the underbrush. \nThreepio asks Wicket where Paploo went and is given a short reply. \nTHREEPIO Oh! Oh, my. Uh, Princess Leia! \nLEIA Quiet. \nTHREEPIO I'm afraid our furry companion has gone and done something rather rash. \nLEIA Oh, no. \n84   EXT BUNKER - ENTRANCE \nPaploo has slipped out of the undergrowth near where the Imperial scouts are lounging. He silently swings his furry ball of a body onto one of the scout's speeder bikes and begins flipping switches at random. Suddenly, the bike's engine fires up with a tremendous ROAR. Paploo grins and continues flipping switches. The scouts leap up in surprise. \n85   EXT RIDGE \nHan, Leia and company watch in distress. Chewie barks. \nHAN \t(sighs) There goes our surprise attack. \n86   EXT BUNKER \nThe Imperial scouts race toward Paploo just as his speeder zooms into motion. Paploo hangs on by his paws and shoots away into the forest. \nSCOUT Look! Over there! Stop him! \nThree of the Imperial scouts jump on their rocket bikes and speed away in pursuit. The fourth watches them go from his post at the door. \nEMPEROR\t (angry) Everything that has transpired has done so according to my design. (indicates Endor) Your friends up there on the Sanctuary Moon... \nLuke reacts. The Emperor notes it. \nEMPEROR\t (cont) ...are walking into a trap. As is your Rebel fleet! It was I who allowed the Alliance to know the location of the shield generator. It is quite safe from your pitiful little band. An entire legion of my best troops awaits them. \nLuke's look darts from the Emperor to Vader and, finally, to the sword in the Emperor's hand. \nEMPEROR Oh...I'm afraid the deflector shield will be quite operational when your friends arrive. \n91   INT BUNKER - MAIN CONTROL ROOM \nHan, Leia, Chewie, and the Rebel strike team storm through a door and enter the main control room, taking all of the personnel prisoner. \nHAN All right! Up! Move! Come on! Quickly! Quickly, Chewie. \nThe Rebel troops herd the generator controllers away from their panels. Leia glances at one of the screens on the control panel. \nLEIA Han! Hurry! The fleet will be here any moment. \nHAN Charges!  Come on, come on! \nOutside, Threepio watches nervously in the bushes as several more controllers and stormtroopers run into the bunker, leaving guards at the door. \nTHREEPIO\t (to Wicket) Oh, my! They'll be captured! \nWicket chatters in Ewok language, and then takes off full steam into the forest. \nTHREEPIO Wa-wait! Wait, come back! Artoo, stay with me. \nInside the bunker, Han looks up from setting charges as an Imperial commander enters. \nCOMMANDER Freeze! You Rebel scum. \nHan and Leia spin, to find dozens of Imperial weapons trained on them and their cohorts. A poised force of Imperial troops surround them. Even more pour into the room, roughly disarming the Rebel contingent. Han, Leia, and Chewie exchange looks. They're helpless. \n92   EXT SPACE - ENDOR, DEATH STAR, REBEL FLEET \nThe Death Star and its Sanctuary Moon hang distant in space as the Rebel fleet comes out of hyperspace with an awesome roar. The Millennium Falcon and several Rebel fighters are at the front as the space armada bears down on its target. \n93   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nLando flips switches, checks his screen, and speaks into the radio. \nLANDO All wings report in. \nWEDGE Red Leader standing by. \nGRAY LEADER Gray Leader standing by. \nGREEN LEADER Green Leader standing by. \nWEDGE Lock S-foils in attack positions. \n94   INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE \nFrom the bridge of the Rebel Headquarters Frigate, Admiral Ackbar watches the fighters massing outside his viewscreen. \nACKBAR May the Force be with us. \n95   INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nLando looks worriedly at his alien copilot, Nien Nunb, who points to the control panel and talks to Lando. \nLANDO We've got to be able to get some kind of a reading on that shield, up or down. Well, how could they be jamming us if they don't know if we're coming. \nLando shoots a concerned look out at the approaching Death Star as the implications of what he's just said sink in. He hits a switch on his comlink. \nTHREEPIO Hello! I say, over there! Were you looking for me? \nBUNKER COMMANDER Bring those two down here! \nSTORMTROOPER Let's go! \nArtoo and Threepio are standing near one of the big trees. As six Imperial stormtroopers rush over to take them captive, the two droids duck out of sight behind the tree. \nTHREEPIO Well, they're on their way. Artoo, are you sure this was a good idea? \nSTORMTROOPER Freeze! Don't move! \nTHREEPIO We surrender. \nThe stormtroopers come around the tree and find the two droids waiting quietly to be taken. As the Imperial troops move to do that, however, a band of Ewoks drops down from above and overpowers them. \nTHREEPIO Ohhh! Stand back, Artoo. \nIn a nearby tree, an Ewok raises a horn to his lips and sounds the EWOK ATTACK CALL. All hell breaks loose as hundreds of Ewoks throw their fuzzy bodies into the fray against the assembled stormtroopers and their awesome two-legged walkers. Biker scouts dart about blasting Ewoks, only to be crushed by a volley of rocks tossed by Ewoks from the trees above. \nIn the confusion of the battle, Han and Leia break away and dive for the cover of the bunker door as explosions erupt around them. Han goes to the bunker door control panel. \nLEIA The code's changed. We need Artoo! \nHAN Here's the terminal. \nLEIA\t (into comlink) Artoo, where are you? We need you at the bunker right away. \nArtoo and Threepio are hiding behind a log as the battle ragesaround them. Suddenly the stubby little astrodroid lets out a series of whistles and shoots off across the battlefield. Threepio, panicked, runs after him. \nTHREEPIO Going? What do you mean, you're going. But-- but going where, Artoo? No, what! Artoo! Oh, this is no time for heroics. Come back! \nBiker scouts race around and over the two droids, blasting away at the little Ewoks as the furries scurry for cover. \nA group of Ewoks have moved a primitive catapult into position. They fire off a large boulder that hits one of the walkers. The walker turns and heads for the catapult, blasting away with both guns. The Ewoks abandon their weapons and flee in all directions. Just as the walker moves in to stomp the catapult, Ewoks drop vines restraining two huge logs that swing down and smash thewalker's head flat. \nA line of Ewoks hang desperately to a vine that is hooked to a walker's foot. As the walker moves along, the fuzzy creatures are dragged behind. \nTwo speeder bikes chase Ewoks through the underbrush. As the scouts round a tree, they are knocked off their bikes by a vinetied between two trees. \n100  EXT SPACE \nThe Falcon and other Rebel fighters are engaged in a ferocious combat with Imperial TIE fighters, the battle raging around thecruisers of the Rebel armada. \n101  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT Lando is in radio communication with the pilots of the other Rebel squads. \nLANDO Watch yourself, Wedge! Three from above! \nWEDGE Red Three, Red Two, pull in! \nRED TWO Got it! \nRED THREE Three of them coming in, twenty degrees! \nWEDGE Cut to the left! I'll take the leader! They're heading for the medical frigate. \nLando steers the Falcon through a complete flip, as his crew fires at the TIEs from the belly guns. \nNAVIGATOR Pressure's steady. \nThe copilot Nien Nunb chatters an observation. \nLANDO Only the fighters are attacking.  I wonder what those Star Destroyers are waiting for. \n102  EXT SPACE - IMPERIAL FLEET \nThe giant Imperial Star Destroyer waits silently some distance from the battle. The Emperor's huge Super Star Destroyer rests in the middle of the fleet. \n118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE \nThe two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each other in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next to a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the Imperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack one of the larger Imperial ships. \nLANDO Watch out. Squad at .06. \nREBEL PILOT I'm on it, Gold Leader. \nWEDGE Good shot, Red Two. \nLANDO Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down. \n119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM \nControllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an Imperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and interference. \nHAN/PILOT\t (VO) It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. \nThe controllers cheer. \nCONTROL ROOM COMMANDER Send three squads to help. Open the back door. \nSECOND COMMANDER Yes, sir. \n120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER \nAs the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out, they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their weapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the roof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns as Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges. \n121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM \nHan, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant explosive charges on the control panels and rush out. \nHAN Throw me another charge. \n122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM \nVader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready. \nVADER You cannot hide forever, Luke. \nLUKE I will not fight you. \nVADER Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... \nVader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in anguish. \nVADER Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. \nLUKE Never-r-r! \nLuke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat. \nThe Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation. \nEMPEROR Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! \nLuke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his father. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away. \nLUKE Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. \nThe Emperor's glee turns to rage. \nEMPEROR So be it...Jedi. \n123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER \nHan and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across the clearing. \n127  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE \nACKBAR We've got to give those fighters more time. Concentrate all fire on that Super Star Destroyer. \nX-wings pilots head across the surface of the huge battleship. \n128  INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE \nAdmiral Piett and a commander stand at the window, looking out to the battle. They look concerned. \nCONTROLLER Sir, we've lost our bridge deflector shield. \nPIETT Intensify the forward batteries. I don't want anything to get through. \nThe commander is looking out of the window where a damaged Rebel fighter is out of control and heading directly toward the bridge. \nPIETT Intensify forward firepower! \nCOMMANDER It's too late! \nThe Rebel pilot screams as his ship hits the Star Destroyer, causing a huge explosion. The giant battle ship loses control, crashes into the Death Star, and explodes. \n129  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE \nThere is excitement on the bridge as the battle rages on all sides. They cheer as the giant Star Destroyer blows up. \n130  INT DEATH STAR - MAIN DOCKING BAY \nChaos. For the first time, the Death Star is rocked by explosions as the Rebel fleet, no longer backed against a wall, zooms over, unloading a heavy barrage. Imperial troops run in all directions, confused and desperate to escape. \nIn the midst of this uproar, Luke is trying to carry the enormous deadweight of his father's weakening body toward an Imperial shuttle. Finally, Luke collapses from the strain. The explosions grow louder as Vader draws him closer. \nVADER\t (a whisper) Luke, help me take this mask off. \nLURE But you'll die. \nVADER Nothing can stop that now. Just for once... let me look on you with my own eyes. \nSlowly, hesitantly, Luke removes the mask from his father's face. There beneath the scars is an elderly man. His eyes do not focus. But the dying man smiles at the sight before him. \nANAKIN\t (very weak) Now...go, my son. Leave me. \nLUKE No. You're coming with me. I can't leave you here. I've got to save you. \nANAKIN You already have, Luke. You were right about me. Tell your sister...you were right. \nLUKE Father...I won't leave you. \nDarth Vader, Anakin Skywalker...Luke's father, dies. \nA huge explosion rocks the docking bay. Slowly, Luke rises and, half carrying, half dragging the body of his father, stumbles toward a shuttle. \n131  EXT DEATH STAR \nThe Millennium Falcon leads a swerving bomb run through the immense superstructure of the half-built Death Star. The Rebel Star Cruisers outside continually bombard the huge station. And each direct hit is answered by resonating, chain-reaction explosions within the station itself. \n132  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT AND GUN PORTS \nLando's crew fires away at the pursuing TIE fighters as the dashing Baron of Bespin and his alien copilot home in on the main reactor shaft. It is awesome. A lone X-wing is just in front of the Falcon. \nWEDGE There it is! \nLANDO All right, Wedge. Go for the power regulator on the north tower. \nWEDGE Copy, Gold Leader. I'm already on my way out. \nThe X-wing heads for the top of the huge reactor and fires several proton torpedoes at the power regulator, causing a series of small explosions. \n", "test1_input": "Luke continues to destroy the aliens on the guards' skiff, as Han extends his spear downward to Lando, who is still dangling precariously from a rope on the prisoner's skiff. \nHAN Lando, grab it! \nLANDO Lower it! \nHAN I'm trying! \nA major hit from the barge deck gun knocks the skiff on its side. Han and almost everything else on board slides overboard. The rope breaks, and Lando falls to the side of the Sarlacc pit. Luckily, Han's foot catches on the skiff railing and he dangles above Lando and the pit. The wounded Wookiee holds onto the skiff for dear life as another hit from the deck gun rocks the skiff violently. \nHAN Whoa! Whoa! Grab me, Chewie! I'm slipping. \nChewie grabs hold of Han's feet, holding him upside down, as Han extends the spear toward Lando, who is clutching to the side of the pit. \nHAN Grab it! L--Lando. Grab! \nLuke finishes off the last guard on the second skiff. He sees the deck gun blasting away at his helpless companions. Luke leaps from the skiff, across a chasm of air, to the sheer metallic side of the Sail Barge. Barely able to get a fingerhold, he begins a painful climb up the hull, when suddenly an ax smashes through a window an inch from his head. With Jedi agility, Luke grasps the wrist holding the ax and yanks the helpless guard through the broken window and into the deadly pit. \nThe injured Chewie is reaching over the rail for the dangling Han, who is in turn blindly reaching down toward the desperate Lando. The Baron has stopped his slippage down the sandy slope of the Sarlacc pit by lying very still. Every time he tries to reach for Han, the loose sand moves him closer to his final reward. \nHAN Grab it! Almost... You almost got it! \nAnother blast hits the front of the tilted skiff, causing Lando to let go of the spear. \nLANDO Hold it! Whoa! \nAgain Han extends the spear toward Lando. \nHAN Gently now. All... all right. Now easy, easy. Hold me, Chewie. \nLando screams. One of the Sarlacc's tentacles has wrapped tightly around his ankle, dragging him down the side of the pit. \nHAN Chewie! Chewie, give me the gun. Don't move, Lando. \nLANDO No, wait! I thought you were blind! \nHAN It's all right. Trust me. Don't move. \nLANDO All right! A little higher! Just a little higher! \nHan adjusts his aim as Lando lowers his head, and the fuzzy-eyed pirate fires at the tentacle. Direct hit. The tentacle releases Lando, and Chewie starts to pull them on board the skiff. \nHAN Chewie, Pull us up! Come on! Okay... up, Chewie, up! \n38   EXT UPPER DECK \nThe deck gunners have Chewie and the desperate dangling human chain in their gun sights when something up on deck commands their attention: Luke, standing before them like a pirate king, ignites his lightsaber. The deck gunners have barely reached for their pistols before the young Jedi has demolished them. Immediately, Luke turns to see two more gunners (who have been uncovering a giant gun at the end of the barge) racing for him, firing their laser pistols. \n39   INT SAIL BARGE - OBSERVATION DECK \nLeia is struggling against her chains in desperation as Artoo zips through the tumult of confused monsters to the rescue; the stubby little droid extends a small laser gun and blasts the chain apart. \nLEIA Come on. We gotta get out of here quick. \nArtoo and Leia race for the exit, passing Threepio, who is kicking and screaming as Salacious Crumb, the reptilian monkey- monster picks out one of the golden droid's eyes. \nTHREEPIO Not my eyes! Artoo, help! Quickly, Artoo. Oh! Ohhh! You beast! \nArtoo zips over and zaps Salacious, sending him skyward with a scream, crashing into the rafters as Artoo, Leia, and Threepio (with his eye dangling from a wire) hurry off. \n40   EXT UPPER DECK - SAIL BARGE \nLuke is warding off laser blasts with his lightsaber, surrounded by guards and fighting like a demon. Leia emerges onto the deck as Luke turns to face another guard. \nLUKE\t (to Leia) Get the gun! Point it at the deck! \nLeia turns toward the barge cannon, climbs on the platform, and swivels the gun around. \n", "test1_true": "A laser blast hits Luke's mechanical hand and he bends over in pain, but manages to swing his lightsaber upward and take out the last of the guards. He looks at the wounded hand, which reveals the mechanism. He flexes the hand; it still works. \nNear the rail of the upper deck, Artoo and Threepio steady themselves as Threepio gets ready to jump. Artoo beeps wildly. \nTHREEPIO Artoo, where are we going? I couldn't possibly jump. \nArtoo butts the golden droid over the edge and steps off himself, tumbling toward the sand. \nLuke runs along the empty deck toward Leia and the barge gun, which she has brought around to point down at the deck. \nLUKE Come on! \nLuke has hold on one of the rigging ropes from the mast. He gathers Leia in his other arm and kicks the trigger of the deck gun. The gun explodes into the deck as Luke and Leia swing out toward the skiff. \n41   EXT SKIFF \nHan leans panting against the rail as Chewie helps Lando onto the deck. Luke and Leia land on the skiff with flair. \nLUKE Let's go! And don't forget the droids. \nLANDO We're on our way. \nThe Sail Barge is exploding in stages in the distance. Half of the huge craft is on fire. \n42   EXT SAND DUNE \nThreepio's legs stick straight up from the dune where he landed. Next to it, Artoo's periscope is the only thing above the sand. The skiff floats above them and two large electromagnets dangle down on a wire. With a loud CLANG, both droids are pulled from the sand. \n43   EXT DUNE SEA \nThe little skiff skips around the burning Sail Barge, which continues its chain of explosions. As the skiff sails off across the desert, the barge settles to the sand and disappears in one final conflagration. \n44   EXT DUNE SEA - LANDING AREA \nA ferocious sandstorm blocks our view. Then, through the ROAR, we HEAR THE VOICES of our heroes. They emerge slowly from the veil of sand, pressing on against the wind. First come Artoo and Threepio, followed by Leia guiding Han, then Luke and Lando come into view, each supporting one side of the towering Chewbacca, who hobbles from his wound. \nSoon, they can make out some large vague shapes in the blowing sand. It is the Millennium Falcon and, parked beside it, Luke's trusty X-wing and a two-seated Y-wing. They must shout to be heard. \nHAN I don't know. All I can see is a lot of blowing sand! \nLEIA That's all any of us can see. \nHAN\t (blinking) Then I guess I'm getting better. \nAs soon as the group huddles under the bulk of the Falcon, the wind dies down to something more describable as a severe weather condition. Threepio hits a switch, and the gang-plank lowers with a HUM. \nHAN \t(turning to Luke) I've got to hand it to you, kid, you were pretty good out there. \nLUKE\t (shrugging it off) I had a lot of help. Think nothing of it. \nHAN No, I'm thinking a lot about it. That carbon freeze was the closest thing to dead there is. And it wasn't just sleepin'. It was a big wide awake nothing! \nLuke nods, as Chewie growls affectionately at the young Jedi warrior, mussing his hair like a proud uncle. And Leia warmly hugs him. \nLUKE \t(moving to his ship) I'll see you back at the fleet. \nHAN Why don't you leave that crate and come with us? \nLUKE I have a promise I have to keep first... to an old friend. \nLuke and Artoo take off in their spacecraft. \nHAN (looking dubiously at Lando, obviously remembering his friend's betrayal and subsequent aide) Guess I owe you some thanks, too, Lando. \nLANDO Figured if I left you frozen like that you'd just give me bad luck the rest of my life, so I might as well get you unfrozen sooner or later. \n", "test2_input": "HAN Shuttle Tydirium requesting deactivation of the deflector shield. \nCONTROLLER\t (over radio) Shuttle Tydirium, transmit the clearance code for shield passage. \nHAN Transmission commencing. \nLeia and Chewbacca listen tensely as the sound of a high speed transmission begins. \nLEIA Now we find out if that code is worth the price we paid. \nHAN It'll work. It'll work. \nChewie whines nervously. Luke stares at the Huge Super Star Destroyer that looms ever larger before them. \nLUKE Vader's on that ship. \nHAN Now don't get jittery, Luke. There are a lot of command ships. Keep your distance though, Chewie, but don't look like you're trying to keep your distance. \nChewie barks a question. \nHAN I don't know.  Fly casual. \nLUKE I'm endangering the mission. I shouldn't have come. \nHAN It's your imagination, kid. Come on. Let's keep a little optimism here. \nChewie barks his worries as the Super Star Destroyer grows larger out the window. \n60   INT VADER'S STAR DESTROYER - BRIDGE \nLord Vader stands, back to us, staring out a window at the Death Star. Now, some vibration felt only by him causes him to turn. After a moment of stillness, he walks down the row of controllers to where ADMIRAL PIETT is leaning over the tracking screen of the controller we've seen earlier. Piett straightens at Vader's approach. \nVADER Where is that shuttle going? \nPIETT\t (into comlink) Shuttle Tydirium, what is your cargo and destination? \nPILOT VOICE    (HAN)   (filtered) Parts and technical crew for the forest moon. \nThe Bridge Commander looks to Vader for a reaction. \nVADER Do they have a code clearance? \nPIETT It's an older code, sir, but it checks out. I was about to clear them. \nVader looks upward, as he senses Luke's presence. \nPIETT Shall I hold them? \nVADER No. Leave them to me. I will deal with them myself. \nPIETT\t (surprised) As you wish, my lord. (to controller) Carry on. \nPiett nods at controller, who switches on his comlink. \n61   INT STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - COCKPIT \nThe group waits tensely. \nHAN They're not goin' for it, Chewie. \nCONTROLLER\t (filtered) Shuttle Tydirium, deactivation of the shield will commence immediately. Follow your present course. \nEveryone breaths a sigh of relief. Everyone but Luke, who looks worried. Chewie barks. \nHAN Okay! I told you it was gonna work. No problem. \n62   EXT SPACE - STOLEN IMPERIAL SHUTTLE - ENDOR \n", "test2_true": "63   EXT FOREST LANDING SITE - ENDOR \nThe stolen Imperial shuttle sits in a clearing of the moon's dark, primeval forest, dwarfed by the ancient towering trees. \nOn an adjacent hill, the helmeted Rebel contingent makes its way up a steep trail. Leia and Han are slightly ahead of Chewie and Luke. The troops of the strike-team squad follow, with Artoo and Threepio bringing up the rear. Artoo beeps. \nUp ahead, Chewie and Leia reach a crest in the hill and drop suddenly to the ground, signaling the rest of the group to stop. Han and Luke crawl up to take a look. \nTHREEPIO Oh, I told you it was dangerous here. \nTHEIR POV. Not far below them, two IMPERIAL SCOUTS are wandering through bushes in the valley below. Their two ROCKET BIKES are parked nearby. \nLEIA Shall we try and go around? \nHAN It'll take time. This whole party'll be for nothing if they see us. \nLeia motions for the squad to stay put, then she, Han, Luke and Chewie start quietly down. \n64   EXT FOREST CLEARING - CAMPSITE \nThe four friends make their way to the edge of the clearing not far from the two Imperial scouts. \nHAN Chewie and I will take care of this. You stay here. \nLUKE Quietly, there might be more of them out there. \nHAN\t (grins) Hey... it's me. \nHan and Chewie turn and start through the bushes toward the scouts. Luke and Leia exchange smiles. \nHan sneaks up behind one of the scouts, steps on a twig and the scout whirls, knocking Han into a tree. The scout shouts for his companion. \nSCOUT #1 Go for help! Go! \nThe second scout jumps on his speeder bike and takes off, but Chewie gets off a shot on his crossbow laser weapon, causing the scout to crash into a tree. Han and Scout #1 are in a rousing fistfight. \nLUKE\t (sarcastic) Great. Come on. \nLuke starts for the scuffle, followed by Leia with her laser pistol drawn. As they run through the bushes, Leia stops and points to where two more scouts are sitting on their speeder bikes, with an unoccupied bike parked nearby. \nLEIA Over there! Two more of them! \nLUKE I see them. Wait, Leia! \nBut Leia doesn't hear him and races for the remaining speeder bike. She starts it up and takes off as Luke jumps on the bike behind her. \nLUKE\t (pointing to the controls) Quick! Jam their comlink. Center switch! \nLuke and Leia speed into the dense foliage in hot pursuit, barely avoiding two huge trees. \nHAN Hey, wait! Ahhh! \nHe flips the remaining scout to the ground. \n65   EXT FOREST - THE BIKE CHASE \nThe two fleeing Imperial scouts have a good lead as Luke and Leia pursue through the giant trees at 200 miles an hour, the fire from their bike's laser cannon hitting harmlessly near the moving targets. \nLUKE Move closer! \nLeia guns it, closing the gap, as the two scouts recklessly veer through a narrow gap in the trees. One of the bikes SCRAPES a tree, slowing the scout. \nLUKE Get alongside that one! \nLeia pulls her speeder bike up so close to the scout's bike that their steering vanes SCRAPE noisily. Luke leaps from his bike to the back of the scout's, grabs the Imperial warrior around the neck, and flips him off the bike, into a thick tree trunk. Luke gains control of the bike and follows Leia, who has pulled ahead. They tear off after the remaining scout. \n", "test3_input": "The little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally landing on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and smoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn around to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in his body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded companion. \nTHREEPIO My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? \nHAN Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. \nLEIA I'll cover you. \nEwoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the stormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the wing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting laser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are struck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then realizes that he is dead. \n112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR \nThe Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death Star's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star Destroyers. \n113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nLando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating giants. He's been yelling into the comlink. \nLANDO\t (desperately) Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range. \nACKBAR At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. \nLANDO We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. \nThe Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and begin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the giant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire. \nThe control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack. \nREBEL PILOT She's gonna blow! \nY-WING PILOT I'm hit! \nThe damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into the control tower, exploding. \n114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM \nOut of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there is no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke. \nEMPEROR Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. \nLuke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him. \nEMPEROR Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete. \nLuke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He ignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber flashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his father. \n115  EXT FOREST \nThe battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the Imperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs. \nA walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until it finally topples over with a great crash. \nA scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever- tightening circles until it runs out of rope and crashes into the trees with a huge explosion. \nChewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks cling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, then hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window. \nWALKER PILOT #1 Look! \nPILOT #2 Get him off of there! \nThe walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked out and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside, Chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch with a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to listen to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker. \nChewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The Ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the battle in their favor. \n116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER \nHan works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some stormtroopers. \n", "test3_true": "The three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a second blast door crashes down in front of the first. \nHan frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her shoulder hit by a laser blast. \nTHREEPIO Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? \nHAN Let's see. \nLEIA It's not bad. \nSTORMTROOPER\t (OS) Freeze! \nThey freeze. \nTHREEPIO Oh, dear. \nSTORMTROOPER Don't move! \nLeia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two stormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment seems suspended in time. \nHAN I love you. \nAnother shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han. \nLEIA I know. \nSTORMTROOPER Hands up! Stand up! \nHan stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward Leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, its deadly weapons aimed right at him. \nHAN\t (to Leia) Stay back. \nThe hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and barks triumphantly. \nHAN Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea. \n117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM \nLuke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even more vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke stands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack. \nEMPEROR (laughing) Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you. \nLuke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and realizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being. \nVADER Obi-Wan has taught you well. \nLUKE I will not fight you, father. \nVader walks back up the stairs to Luke. \nVADER You are unwise to lower your defenses. \nVader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader stands below him. \nLUKE Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. \nVADER There is no conflict. \nLUKE You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. \nVADER You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. \nVader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's platform. Vader moves to find him. \nEMPEROR\t (laughs) Good.  Good. \n"}

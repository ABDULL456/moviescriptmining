{"test1_input": "LUKE Get him! \nThe speeding chase passes TWO MORE IMPERIAL SCOUTS. These two swing into pursuit, chasing Luke and Leia, firing away with their laser cannon. The two Rebels look behind them just as Luke's bike takes a glancing hit. \nLUKE\t (indicating the one ahead) Keep on that one! I'll take these two! \nWith Leia shooting ahead, Luke suddenly slams his steering vanes into the braking mode. Luke's bike is a blur to the two pursuing scouts as they zip by him on either side. Luke slams his bike into forward and starts firing away, having switched places with his pursuers in a manner of seconds. Luke's aim is good and one scout's bike is blasted out of control. It explodes against a tree trunk. \nThe scout's cohort takes one glance back at the flash and shifts into turbo drive, going even faster. Luke keeps on his tail. \nFAR AHEAD, Leia and the first scout are doing a highspeed slalom through the death-dealing trunks. Now Leia aims her bike skyward and rises out of sight. \nThe scout turns in confusion, unable to see his pursuer. Suddenly, Leia dives down upon him from above, cannon blasting. The scout's bike takes a glancing hit. \nLeia moves in alongside him. The scout eyes her beside him, reaches down, and pulls out a handgun. Before Leia can react, the scout has blasted her bike, sending it out of control. Leia dives off as her bike explodes against a tree. The happy scout looks back at the explosion. But when he turns forward again, he is on a collision course with a giant fallen tree. He hits his brakes to no avail and disappears in a conflagration. \nANOTHER PART OF THE FOREST: Luke and the last remaining scout continue their weaving chase through the trees. Now Luke moves up close. The scout responds by slamming his bike into Luke's. A fallen tree forms a bridge across their path. The scout zips under. Luke goes over the top and crashes his bike down on the scout's. Both riders look ahead - a wide trunk looms directly in Luke's path, but the scout's bike beside him makes it almost impossible for him to avoid it. Luke banks with all his might, leaning almost horizontal over the scout's bike, and is able to make it by, just clipping the tree. When he straightens, he and the scout discover that their two bikes have locked front vanes and are moving as one. \nAnother big tree looms in Luke's path. He reacts instinctively and dives off his bike. The two bikes come apart a second before Luke's explodes against a tree. The scout sweeps out and circles back to find Luke. \nLuke rises from the undergrowth as the scout bears down on him and opens fire with his laser cannon. Luke ignites his laser sword and begins deflecting the bolts. The scout's bike keeps coming and it appears that in a second it will cut Luke in half. At the last instant, Luke steps aside and chops off the bike's control vanes with one mighty slash. The scout's bike begins to shudder, then, pitching and rolling, it rises up to slam directly into a tree in a giant ball of fire. \n66   EXT SCOUT CAMPSITE - FOREST \nHan, Chewie, and the droids, along with the rest of the squad, wait anxiously in the clearing. Artoo's radar screen sticks out of his domed head and revolves, scanning the forest. He beeps. \nTHREEPIO Oh, General Solo, somebody's coming. Oh! \nHan, Chewie, and the rest of the squad raise their weapons. \nLuke steps out of the foliage to find the weapons trained on him. He's too tired to care. He plops himself down on a boulder and looks around. \nHAN Luke! Where's Leia? \nLUKE\t (concerned) What? She didn't come back? \nHAN I thought she was with you. \nLUKE We got separated. \nLuke and Han exchange a silent, grim look. Luke gets up wearily. \nLUKE Hey, we better go look for her. \nHan nods, and signals to a Rebel officer. \nHAN Take the squad ahead.  We'll meet at the shield generator at 0300. \nLUKE Come on, Artoo.  We'll need your scanners. \nLuke, Chewie, Han, and the droids move off in one direction as the squad proceeds in another. \nTHREEPIO Don't worry, Master Luke.  We know what to do. \nThey move off into the woods. \nTHREEPIO\t (to Artoo) And you said it was pretty here. Ugh! \n67   EXT FOREST CLEARING - LEIA'S CRASH SITE \nA strange little furry face with huge black eyes comes slowly into view. The creature is an EWOK, by the name of WICKET. He seems somewhat puzzled, and prods Leia with a spear. The princess groans; this frightens the stubby ball of fuzz and he prods her again. Leia sits up and stares at the three-foot-high Ewok. She tries to figure out where she is and what has happened. Her clothes are torn; she's bruised and disheveled. \nThe Ewok jumps up and grabs a four-foot-long spear, which he holds in a defensive position. Leia watches him as he circles warily and begins poking her with the sharp point of the spear. \nLEIA Cut it out! \nShe stands up, and the Ewok quickly backs away. \n", "test1_true": "Leia looks around at the dense forest, and at the charred remains of her speeder bike, then sits down, with a sigh, on a fallen log. \nLEIA Well, looks like I'm stuck here. Trouble is, I don't know where here is. \nShe puts her head in her hands to rub away some of the soreness from her fall. She looks over at the watchful little Ewok and pats the log beside her. \nLEIA Well, maybe you can help me. Come on, sit down. \nWicket holds his spear up warily and growls at her like a puppy. Leia pats the log again. \nLEIA I promise I won't hurt you. Now come here. \nMore growls and squeaks from the little bear creature. \nLEIA All right. You want something to eat? \nShe takes a scrap of food out of her pocket and offers it to him. Wicket takes a step backward, then cocks his head and moves cautiously toward Leia, chattering in his squeaky Ewok language. \nLEIA That's right. Come on. Hmmm? \nSniffing the food curiously, the Ewok comes toward Leia and sits on the log beside her. She takes off her helmet, and the little creature jumps back, startled again. He runs along the log, pointing his spear at her and chattering a blue streak. Leia holds out the helmet to him. \nLEIA Look, it's a hat. It's not gonna hurt you. Look. You're a jittery little thing, aren't you? \nReassured, Wicket lowers his spear and climbs back on the log, coming to investigate the helmet. Suddenly his ears perk up and he begins to sniff the air. He looks around warily, whispering some Ewokese warning to Leia. \nLEIA What is it? \nSuddenly a laser bolt comes out of the foliage and explodes on the log next to Leia. Leia and Wicket both roll backwards off the log, hiding behind it. Leia holds her own laser gun ready, while Wicket disappears underneath the log. Another shot, and still no sight of anyone in the forest. Then Leia senses something and turns to find a large IMPERIAL SCOUT standing over her with his weapon pointed at her head. He reaches out his hand for her weapon. \nSCOUT #l Freeze!  Come on, get up! \nShe hands the weapon over, as a second scout emerges from the foliage in front of the log. \nSCOUT #1 Go get your ride and take her back to base. \nSCOUT #2 Yes, sir. \nThe second scout starts toward his bike, as Wicket, crouched under the log, extends his spear and hits the first scout on the leg. The scout jumps and lets out an exclamation, and looks down at Wicket, puzzled. Leia grabs a branch and knocks him out. She dives for his laser pistol, and the second scout, now on his bike, takes off. Leia fires away and hits the escaping bike, causing it to crash into the first scout's bike, which flies end over end and explodes. The forest is quiet once more. Wicket pokes his fuzzy head up from behind the log and regards Leia with\u00canew respect. He mumbles his awe. Leia hurries over, looking around all the time, and motions the chubby little creature into the dense foliage. \nLEIA Come on, let's get outta here. \nAs they move into the foliage, Wicket takes the lead. He shrieks and tugs at Leia to follow him. \n68   INT DEATH STAR - CORRIDOR TO EMPEROR'S TOWER \nDarth Vader walks down the corridor to the Emperor's Tower and private elevator. The Emperor's private guard steps in Vader's path. \nGUARD Halt! The Emperor does not wish to be disturbed at the moment. \nVADER (raising his gloved hand to the two guards and choking them with the Force) The Emperor will see me, now! \nGUARD (repeating Vader's command) The Emperor will see you, now. \n69   INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM \nTwo red Imperial Guards stand watch at the elevator as the door opens to reveal Vader. Vader enters the eerie, foreboding throne room. It appears to be empty. His footsteps echo as he approaches the throne. He waits, absolutely still. The Emperor sits with his back to the Dark Lord. \nEMPEROR I told you to remain on the command ship. \nVADER A small Rebel force has penetrated the shield and landed on Endor. \nEMPEROR\t (no surprise) Yes, I know. \nVADER\t (after a beat) My son is with them. \n", "test1_id": 3081, "test2_input": "The little droid moves to the terminal and plugs in his computer arm. A large explosion hits near Artoo, knocking him head over heels, finally landing on his feet. The stubby astrodroid's head is spinning and smoldering. Suddenly there is a loud SPROOING and Han and Leia turn around to see Artoo with all his compartment doors open, and all of his appendages sticking out; water and smoke spurt out of the nozzles in his body. Han rushes to the terminal, as Threepio rushes to his wounded companion. \nTHREEPIO My goodness! Artoo, why did you have to be so brave? \nHAN Well, I suppose I could hotwire this thing. \nLEIA I'll cover you. \nEwoks in handmade, primitive hanggliders drop rocks onto the stormtroopers, divebombing their deadly adversaries.  One is hit in the wing with laser fire and crashes. A walker lumbers forward, shooting laser blasts at frantic Ewoks running in all directions.  Two Ewoks are struck down by laser blasts.  One tries to awaken his friend, then realizes that he is dead. \n112  EXT SPACE - DEATH STAR \nThe Rebel fleet continues to be picked off, from one side by the Death Star's deadly beam, from the other by the rampaging Imperial Star Destroyers. \n113  INT MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT \nLando steers the Falcon wildly through an obstacle course of floating giants. He's been yelling into the comlink. \nLANDO\t (desperately) Yes! I said closer! Move as close as you can and engage those Star Destroyers at point- blank range. \nACKBAR At that close range, we won't last long against those Star Destroyers. \nLANDO We'll last longer then we will against that Death Star...and we might just take a few of them with us. \nThe Rebel cruisers move very close to the Imperial Star Destroyers and begin to blast away at point-blank range. Tiny fighters race across the giant surfaces, against a backdrop of laser fire. \nThe control tower of a Star Destroyer is under attack. \nREBEL PILOT She's gonna blow! \nY-WING PILOT I'm hit! \nThe damaged Y-wing plummets toward the Star Destroyer, and crashes into the control tower, exploding. \n114  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM \nOut of the window and on the view screens, the Rebel fleet is being decimated in blinding explosions of light and debris. But in here there is no sound of battle. The Emperor turns to Luke. \nEMPEROR Your fleet has lost. And your friends on the Endor moon will not survive. There is no escape, my young apprentice. The Alliance will die...as will your friends. \nLuke's eyes are full of rage. Vader watches him. \nEMPEROR Good. I can feel your anger. I am defenseless.  Take your weapon! Strike me down with all your hatred, and your journey towards the dark side will be complete. \nLuke can resist no longer. The lightsaber flies into his hand. He ignites it in an instant and swings at the Emperor. Vader's lightsaber flashes into view, blocking Luke's blow before it can reach the Emperor. The two blades spark at contact. Luke turns to fight his father. \n115  EXT FOREST \nThe battle rages on. Stormtroopers fire on Ewoks with sophisticated weapons while their furry little adversaries sneak up behind the Imperial troopers and bash them over the head with large clubs. \nA walker marches through the undergrowth blasting Ewoks as it goes. An Ewok warrior gives the signal, and a pile of logs is cut loose. The logs tumble under the walker's feet, causing it to slip and slide until it finally topples over with a great crash. \nA scout bike races past and is lassoed with a heavy vine. The other end of the vine is tied to a tree, and the bike swings around in ever- tightening circles until it runs out of rope and crashes into the trees with a huge explosion. \nChewie swings on a vine to the roof of one of the walkers. Two Ewoks cling to him. They land with a thud on the top of the lurching machine, then hang on for dear life. One of the Ewoks peeks through the window. \nWALKER PILOT #1 Look! \nPILOT #2 Get him off of there! \nThe walker pilot opens the hatch to see what's going on. He is yanked out and tossed overboard before he can scream. The two Ewoks jump into the cockpit and knock the second pilot unconscious. The Ewoks are thrown violently as the mighty machine careens out of control. Outside, Chewie is almost knocked overboard; he sticks his head into the hatch with a series of angry barks. The Ewoks are too busy and frightened to listen to the Wookiee's complaint. Chewie slips inside the walker. \nChewbacca's walker moves through the forest, firing laser blasts at unsuspecting stormtroopers, and destroying other Imperial walkers. The Ewoks shout and cheer as the giant machine helps turn the tide of the battle in their favor. \n116  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER \nHan works furiously at the control panel; wires spark as he attempts to hotwire the door. He motions to Leia, who is blasting away at some stormtroopers. \n", "test2_true": "The three wires spark as the connection is made. With a LOUD WHOOSH, a second blast door crashes down in front of the first. \nHan frowns and turns back to the wires again. Leia exchanges shots with stormtroopers in the bushes, then suddenly cries out in pain, her shoulder hit by a laser blast. \nTHREEPIO Oh, Princess Leia, are you all right? \nHAN Let's see. \nLEIA It's not bad. \nSTORMTROOPER\t (OS) Freeze! \nThey freeze. \nTHREEPIO Oh, dear. \nSTORMTROOPER Don't move! \nLeia holds her laser gun ready, behind Han, out of view of the two stormtroopers moving toward them. Han and Leia's eyes lock; the moment seems suspended in time. \nHAN I love you. \nAnother shared look between them, as she smiles up at Han. \nLEIA I know. \nSTORMTROOPER Hands up! Stand up! \nHan stands up slowly and turns, revealing the gun in Leia's hand. She disposes of the stormtroopers in a flash. As Han turns back toward Leia, he looks up to see a giant walker approach and stand before him, its deadly weapons aimed right at him. \nHAN\t (to Leia) Stay back. \nThe hatch on top of the walker opens and Chewie sticks his head out and barks triumphantly. \nHAN Chewie!  Get down here!  She's wounded!  No, wait....  I got an idea. \n117  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM \nLuke and Vader are engaged in a man-to-man duel of lightsabers even more vicious then the battle on Bespin. But the young Jedi has grown stronger in the interim, and now the advantage shifts to him. Vader is forced back, losing his balance, and is knocked down the stairs. Luke stands at the top of the stairs, ready to attack. \nEMPEROR (laughing) Good.  Use your aggressive feelings, boy!  Let the hate flow through you. \nLuke looks momentarily toward the Emperor, then back to Vader, and realizes he is using the dark side. He steps back, turns off his lightsaber, and relaxes, driving the hate from his being. \nVADER Obi-Wan has taught you well. \nLUKE I will not fight you, father. \nVader walks back up the stairs to Luke. \nVADER You are unwise to lower your defenses. \nVader attacks, forcing Luke on the defensive. The young Jedi leaps in an amazing reverse flip up to the safety of the catwalk overhead. Vader stands below him. \nLUKE Your thoughts betray you, father. I feel the good in you...the conflict. \nVADER There is no conflict. \nLUKE You couldn't bring yourself to kill me before, and I don't believe you'll destroy me now. \nVADER You underestimate the power of the dark side. If you will not fight, then you will meet your destiny. \nVader throws the laser sword and it cuts through the supports holding the catwalk, then returns to Vader's hand. Luke tumbles to the ground in a shower of sparks and rolls out of sight under the Emperor's platform. Vader moves to find him. \nEMPEROR\t (laughs) Good.  Good. \n", "test2_id": 3082, "test3_input": "118  EXT SPACE - AIR BATTLE \nThe two armadas, like their sea-bound ancestors, blast away at each other in individual point-blank confrontations. A Star Destroyer explodes. The Rebel victor limps away, its back half alive with a series of minor explosions. The Rebel cruiser manages to move in next to a second Star Destroyer before it explodes completely, taking the Imperial Star Destroyer with it. The Falcon and several fighters attack one of the larger Imperial ships. \nLANDO Watch out. Squad at .06. \nREBEL PILOT I'm on it, Gold Leader. \nWEDGE Good shot, Red Two. \nLANDO Now...come on, Han, old buddy. Don't let me down. \n119  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM \nControllers watch the main viewscreen on which a vague figure of an Imperial walker pilot can be seen. There is a great deal of static and interference. \nHAN/PILOT\t (VO) It's over, Commander. The Rebels have been routed. They're fleeing into the woods. We need reinforcements to continue the pursuit. \nThe controllers cheer. \nCONTROL ROOM COMMANDER Send three squads to help. Open the back door. \nSECOND COMMANDER Yes, sir. \n120  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER \nAs the door to the bunker opens and the Imperial troops rush out, they're surprised to find themselves surrounded by Rebels, their weapons pointed at them. Ewoks holding bows and arrows appear on the roof of the bunker. The Imperial troops throw down their guns as Han and Chewie rush inside the bunker with explosive charges. \n121  INT BUNKER - CONTROL ROOM \nHan, Chewie, and several troops rush into the control room and plant explosive charges on the control panels and rush out. \nHAN Throw me another charge. \n122  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM \nVader stalks the low-ceilinged area on the level below the throne, searching for Luke in the semi-darkness, his lightsaber held ready. \nVADER You cannot hide forever, Luke. \nLUKE I will not fight you. \nVADER Give yourself to the dark side. It is the only way you can save your friends. Yes, your thoughts betray you. Your feelings for them are strong. Especially for... \nVader stops and senses something. Luke shuts his eyes tightly, in anguish. \nVADER Sister! So...you have a twin sister. Your feelings have now betrayed her, too. Obi-Wan was wise to hide her from me. Now his failure is complete. If you will not turn to the dark side, then perhaps she will. \nLUKE Never-r-r! \nLuke ignites his lightsaber and screams in anger, rushing at hisfather with a frenzy we have not seen before. Sparks fly as Luke and Vader fight in the cramped area. Luke's hatred forces Vader to retreat out of the low area and across a bridge overlooking a vast elevator shaft. Each stroke of Luke's sword drives his father further toward defeat. \nThe Dark Lord is knocked to his knees, and as he raises his sword to block another onslaught, Luke slashes Vader's right hand off at the wrist, causing metal and electronic parts to fly from the mechanical stump. Vader's sword clatters uselessly away, over the edge of the platform and into the bottomless shaft below. Luke moves over Vader and holds the blade of his sword to the Dark Lord's throat. The Emperor watches with uncontrollable, pleased agitation. \nEMPEROR Good! Your hate has made you powerful. Now, fulfill your destiny and take your father's place at my side! \nLuke looks at his father's mechanical hand, then to his own mechanical, black-gloved hand, and realizes how much he is becoming like his father. He makes the decision for which he has spent a lifetime in preparation. Luke steps back and hurls his lightsaber away. \nLUKE Never! I'll never turn to the dark side. You've failed, Your Highness. I am a Jedi, like my father before me. \nThe Emperor's glee turns to rage. \nEMPEROR So be it...Jedi. \n123  EXT FOREST - GENERATOR BUNKER \nHan and several of the fighters run out of the bunker and race across the clearing. \n", "test3_true": "A shock wave knocks them flat as the bunker explodes, followed by a spectacular display as the huge shield-generator radar dish explodes along with the bunker. \n124  INT REBEL STAR CRUISER - BRIDGE \nAckbar, sitting in his control chair, speaks into the radio. \nACKBAR The shield is down! Commence attack on theDeath Star's main reactor. \nLANDO We're on our way. Red Group, Gold Group, all fighters follow me. (laughs) Told you they'd do it! \nThe Falcon, followed by several smaller Rebel fighters, heads toward the unfinished superstructure of the Death Star. \n125  INT EMPEROR'S TOWER - THRONE ROOM \nLuke stands still, as the Emperor reaches the bottom of thestairs. The Emperor's laughter has turned to anger. He raises his arms toward Luke. \nEMPEROR If you will not be turned, you will be destroyed. \nBlinding bolts of energy, evil lightning, shoot from the Emperor's hands at Luke. Even in his surprise, the young Jedi tries to use the Force to deflect them. At first he is half successful, but after a moment the bolts of energy are coming with such speed and power the young Jedi shrinks before them, his knees buckling. The wounded Vader struggles to his feet, and moves to stand at his master's side. \nEMPEROR Young fool...only now, at the end, do you understand. \nLuke is almost unconscious beneath the continuing assault of the Emperor's lightning. He clutches a canister to keep from falling into the bottomless shaft as the bolts tear through him. \nEMPEROR Your feeble skills are no match for the power of the dark side. You have paid the price for your lack of vision. \nLuke writhes on the floor in unbearable pain, reaching weakly up toward where Vader stands watching. \nLUKE\t (groans) Father, please. Help me. \nAgain Vader stands, watching Luke. He looks at his master, the Emperor, then back to Luke on the floor. \nEMPEROR Now, young Skywalker...you will die. \nAlthough it would not have seemed possible, the outpouring of bolts from the Emperor's fingers actually increases in intensity, the sound screaming through the room. Luke's body writhes in pain. \nVader grabs the Emperor from behind, fighting for control of the robed figure despite the Dark Lord's weakened body and gravely weakened arm. The Emperor struggles in his embrace, his bolt-shooting hands now lifted high, away from Luke. Now the white lightning arcs back to strike at Vader. He stumbles with his load as the sparks rain off his helmet and flow down over his black cape. He holds his evil master high over his head and walks to the edge of the abyss at the central core of the throne room. With one final burst of his once awesome strength, Darth Vader hurls the Emperor's body into the bottomless shaft. \nThe Emperor's body spins helplessly into the void, arcing as it falls into the abyss. Finally, when the body is far down the shaft, it explodes, creating a rush of air through the room.Vader's cape is whipped by the wind and he staggers, and collapses toward the bottomless hole. Luke crawls to his father's side and pulls him away from the edge of the abyss to safety. Both the young Jedi and the giant warrior are too weak to move. \n126  EXT/INT - SPACE BATTLE - FIGHTER AND DEATH STAR \nRebel fighters follow the Falcon across the surface of the Death Star to the unfinished portion, where they dive into the superstructure of the giant battle station, followed by many TIE fighters. \nWEDGE I'm going in. \nLANDO Here goes nothing. \nThree X-wings lead the chase through the ever-narrowing shaft, followed by the Falcon and four other fighters, plus TIE fighters who continually fire at the Rebels. Lights reflect off the pilot's faces as they race through the dark shaft. \nLANDO Now lock onto the strongest power source. It should be the power generator. \nWEDGE Form up. And stay alert. We could run out of space real fast. \nThe fighters and the Falcon race through the tunnel, still pursued by the TIE fighters. One of the X-wings is hit from behind and explodes. \nLANDO Split up and head back to the surface. See if you can get a few of those TIE fighters to follow you. \nPILOT Copy, Gold Leader. \nThe Rebel ships peel off pursued by three of the TIE's, while Lando and Wedge continue through the main tunnel. It narrows, and the Falcon scrapes the side dangerously. Two other TIE fighters continue to blast away at them. \nLANDO That was too close. \nNien Nunb agrees. The battle between the Rebel and Imperial fleet rages on. Several cruisers fire at the giant Super Star Destroyer. \n", "test3_id": 3083}

(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
JOHN He talks! 
John giggles happily, squeezing the bear to make it talk, as his mom and dad exchange a smile. 
JOHN (CONT'D) I'm gonna name you Teddy. 
INT. JOHN'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DAY 
John sits on the floor watching the 1980 film "Flash Gordon" on TV. He eats Twizzlers with Ted sitting next to him. Occasionally he gives Ted a "bite." 
NARRATOR (V.O.) John became instantly attached to Teddy. There was something about that bear that made him feel as if he finally had a friend with whom he could share his deepest secrets. 
INT. JOHN'S ROOM - NIGHT 
JOHN Hey Teddy... can I tell you something nobody knows? 
Teddy looks back at him, expressionless. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Last week, my mom and dad took me to the park for a picnic. And they have this duck pond there, and... when nobody was looking, I pooped in my hand and threw it at a duck. Was that mean? 
He squeezes Ted, who once again makes the "I wuv you" sound. 
JOHN (CONT'D) (HUGGING HIM) I love you too, Teddy! 
John gets into bed with the teddy bear, and snuggles with it. 
JOHN (CONT'D) You know... I wish you could really talk to me. Because then we could be best friends forever and ever. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
John drifts off to sleep. The camera moves toward the window, and drifts outside. It pulls back from the house slowly. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) Now, if there's one thing you can be sure of... it's that nothing is more powerful than a young boy's wish. (BEAT) Except an Apache helicopter. An Apache helicopter has machine guns and missiles. It is an unbelievably impressive complement of weaponry. An absolute death machine. Well, as it turned out, John picked the perfect night to make a wish. 
EXT. JOHN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
The camera pivots around to face the sky. We see the snow falling from moonlit clouds. At the center of the clouds, there is a small patch of open air through which we can see stars. Suddenly, a shooting star whizzes by through the opening. 
INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
SLOWLY PUSH IN on the teddy bear's face as John lies sleeping next to it. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD - NEXT MORNING The house and yard are covered with snow. 
INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SAME 
John slowly opens his eyes. He turns over to face Teddy, but we see that Teddy is no longer next to him. John bolts upright and looks around, frantically. 
JOHN Teddy? (beat, a bit more concerned) Teddy?! 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
John looks under the covers, but the bear is not there. He jumps out of bed and looks around the bed's perimeter, assuming that Teddy must have fallen off during the night. Finally, he checks underneath the bed. ANGLE FROM UNDERNEATH THE BED we see John looking around. 
JOHN (CONT'D) Teddy? 
John sits up again and freezes, looking right into the camera, wide eyed. ANGLE ON JOHN'S P.O.V.: We see the face of Teddy staring right at him. Teddy blinks once. 
TEDDY Hug me. 
John yelps and stumbles back, falling over. He stares at Teddy, breathing heavily. 
JOHN Did you... did you just talk? 
TEDDY You're my best friend, John. 
JOHN (BEAT) You're alive?! 
TEDDY Uh-huh. 
JOHN Whoa... 
TEDDY Don't look so surprised. You're the one who wished for it, aren't you? 
JOHN Yeah, I... I did wish for it. 
TEDDY Well, here I am. 
JOHN You mean... we get to be best friends... for real? 
TEDDY For real.

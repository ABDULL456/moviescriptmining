He returns to the knife. Finally all that remains inside is a pale white strand. Like swollen angel hair pasta. The nerve. He touches it with the knife edge. 
ARON 
AAAAARRRRRGGGGHHHH! 
He explodes internally with vocal pain, through gritted teeth. The first time he has made any sound during the surgery. But it's like he's been taser-ed, he's stunned still for a minute

He looks at it... the nerve. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON. DAY. 
...and the thin, swollen wire of his own nerve looks back at him. For the final time, he asks himself, `Can you do this?'

INT. CANYON. DAY. 
He puts the knife in and pulls it toward him, an inch, two inches, it lengthens like pulling a guitar string. Unimaginable pain builds in his whole body, like he's pushing his arm into a cauldron of magma... 
(It's difficult to tell because everything is so tight and claustrophobic but maybe the boy is there intermittently riding his shoulders slipping across and around him, or obstructed by the boulder and stopped from getting to Aron) ...until it breaks. He shudders in shock and drops everything for minutes. His head lolls forward dripping. His mind swarming with trauma. And then he's back on the last action stretching the skin of his outer wrist tight and sawing the blade into the wall. It's a piece of gristle on a cutting board. Everything now is forcing us towards the boulder, cramping us in with him impossibly close, he's sweating and heaving, his vision blurring with tears, his contacts failing, his breath impossibly dry and rasping and then, as simply as this all began, his shoulders open and he's free...... He staggers back, one, two, three steps away from his arm... 
His head swarming with colours, swooning, overpowering. He stares at his obituary as he's born again. His feet stagger under him like a new foal, an involuntary dance, we see colours bleeding and blending in his P.O.V.s and the colours invade our shots of him. 
ARON (spitting out this declaration at the rock) 
I AM NOT GOING TO DIE.... HERE.

He's busy packaging his stump in the plastic grocery sack and then wrapping that with the yellow webbing he wore as a chocker to keep his neck warm in the night. He stuffs the repackaged arm into the empty Camelbak backpack and throws the straps over his neck to hold the arm in a makeshift sling. Packs his bag, water reservoir, full bottle of shiny urine, video, pocket knife. Grabs his climbing rope, messy and knotted from its use as insulation, and heads off down the canyon. 
Stops almost immediately and hesitates for a beat. He returns 
to take 2 photos on his still camera of the rock and his hand. Goodbye.

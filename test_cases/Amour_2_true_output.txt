SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE Thank you, sir. 
Short embarrassed PAUSE. 
SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D) Well, I'll be off. Call me if you need anything else. 
GEORGES Yes. I will. 
SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE Is your wife well? ... 
GEORGES Yes, she's OK. She's recovering. 
SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE Fine. Give her my regards. My husband and I are very glad she's back. 
GEORGES Yes, we are too. Bye, Mrs. MÃ©ry, thanks so much. 
SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE Goodbye, sir. 
She heads toward the front door of the apartment, turns around again toward Georges. 
SUPERINTENDENT'S WIFE (CONT'D) I'll bring you the strawberries tomorrow around noon, if that suits you. 
He nods, she closes the door as she leaves. 
SCENE 15 - INT. HALLWAY - TOILET - DAY 
He stands in front of the closed door of the toilet, waiting. After a while, we hear the noise of flushing. After a while longer, we hear 
ANNE (O.S.) There. Can you come in, please? 
He opens the toilet door, goes around Anne, pulls her up, she puts her left arm around his neck, keeps herself upright that way, he pulls up her pants under her skirt. Then they slowly hobble out of the toilet and he sits her back down in the wheelchair. 
SCENE 16 - INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
They are both lying in their beds. Anne sleeps, BREATHING NOISILY. Georges lies with his eyes open, listening attentively to her breathing. 
SCENE 17 - INT. KITCHEN - DAY 
The sun shines in. Georges has cooked something simple. They are both in a good mood, eating and drinking. 
GEORGES ... some banal romance or other about a nobleman and a lower middle- class girl who couldn't have each other and who then, out of sheer magnanimity, decide to renounce their love - in fact I don't quite remember it any more. In any case, afterwards I was thoroughly distraught, and it took me a bit of time to calm down. In the courtyard of the house where grandma lived, there was a young guy at the window who asked me where I'd been. He was a couple of years older than me, a braggart who of course really impressed me. "To the movies", I said, because I was proud that my grandma had given me the money to go all alone to the cinema. (MORE) 
GEORGES (CONT'D) "What did you see?" I started to tell him the story of the movie, and as I did, all the emotion came back. I didn't want to cry in front of the boy, but it was impossible; there I was, crying out loud in the courtyard, and I told him the whole drama to the bitter end. 
ANNE So? How did he react?

SABRINA Good night, Mitch. 
She gives him a thoughtful smile then disappears inside. Dave waits a second, then does a victorious karate chop, YES! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY MORNING Light floods into Mitch's apartment. Dave wakes up and looks at the clock: 9:02. 
DAVE Fuck that. He rolls over and goes back to sleep, a smile on his face... 
EXT. TOAST -- DAY 
Dave sits at an outdoor table, reading a novel and taking his time with brunch. He sees a BUSINESSMAN wolfing down his food and running off to his car, yelling into his cell phone, stressed out of his mind. Dave smiles and keeps reading... 
INT. MITCH'S APARTMENT -- BATHROOM -- DAY 
Dave sits on the toilet, reading his novel and taking a leisurely shit. We hear the clean KER-PLOP of a solid poo hitting the toilet water, and Dave closes his eyes, nice... 
EXT. BATTING CAGES -- DAY 
Dave, in a Dodgers jersey, tees off on baseballs in a batting cage. CRACK! CRACK! CRACK! It feels great... 
EXT. JUNGLE -- MOVIE SET -- DAY 
Dave, holding a cross-bow and wearing a loincloth, has fake sex with his CO-STAR on a jungle set; their mid-sections are conveniently obscured by a giant fern. Dave is selling it, and when Valtan calls cut, the whole CREW applauds, wildly impressed. Dave waves them off, bashful... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DAVE'S OFFICE -- DAY 
Looking hip in jeans, flip flops, and a mildly ironic tee shirt, Dave breezes into his office to find Mitch, in a pressed suit, intently studying a legal casebook at his desk. 
DAVE Well, well, look who's all growns up. 
Dave crashes on the couch, happy. Mitch looks annoyed: 
MITCH Really? Open-toed sandals at work? 
DAVE Are...Are you kidding me? 
MITCH Look, I can't hang right now, okay? I've got the mediation in like ten minutes. Dave stands right back up, surprised and impressed. 
DAVE Wow. Okay. Well, I just wanted t tell you that if you can get a protracted buyout for anything over 700 million dollars, take it, okay? 
MITCH 700 million, you got it. 
DAVE (heading for the door) Also, I wanted to thank you for setting me up with Sabrina. She's amazing. I can't wait to see her 
AGAIN TONIGHT-- 
MITCH What?! Dave: No. You can't, you have to wait at least a week! Dave reaches for his cellphone as he heads out the door. 
DAVE Which reminds me, I wanted to call to see if she got the flowers... 
MITCH You sent her flowers after one date?! Are you retarded?! Do not get me into a relationship, dude! Too late. Dave is already gone. Mitch scowls. Then: 
MITCH (CONT'D) You can come out now, Gladys... A second later, GLADYS, in a form-fitting suit and a sexy new bob, crawls out from under his desk. Mitch zips up his pants. 
MITCH (CONT'D) Look, honey, I don't think this is 
WORKING OUT-- Gladys YANKS him by the tie and gets in his face, wild-eyed: 
GLADYS I haven't had sex in 34 years! This isn't over tit I su e' it's over. 
MITCH F-Fine, but can you please stop following me to the bathroom and calling my house late at night and sending me all those filthy emails? It's, you know, deeply disturbing. 
GLADYS You need to realize something, boy: (whispering in his ear) I fucking own you now. The old lady aggressively makes out with Mitch. Her tongue roams from his mouth and madly licks his face, neck, and forehead. Eventually they separate. Mitch looks stunned. 
GLADYS (CONT'D) I left you a little souvenir in your pocket... She winks and exits. Mitch tentatively reaches into his pocket and pulls out a giant pair of TAN GRANNY PANTIES. 
MITCH I've created a monster...

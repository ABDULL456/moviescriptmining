Mr. Byrd currently lives in Umkumiut, Alaska, with his two labrador retrievers, Lucy and Desi. 
Will looks up.  Slaps the book closed. 
INT./EXT. CHEROKEE - ROAD - DAY 
Will drives, sipping take-out coffee.  Trying to fight the stinging in his eyes.  Passes a sign:  Umkumiut, 30 miles. 
EXT. TESORO ALASKA GAS STATION - UMKUMIUT - DAY 
Will stands in a phone booth at the gas station.  Flips through the phone book.  His finger tracing down the "B"s. Finds it:  Walter Byrd, 451 S. Diamond Tooth, Apt. B. 
EXT. DIAMOND TOOTH ROAD - UMKUMIUT - DAY 
Sky's become overcast.  Will stands across the street from a pale blue building.  On the ground floor, a tackle store. Above, looks like several apartment units. 
He starts across. 
INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY 
Will heads down a narrow hallway.  Tiled floor.  Passes door "A."  Stops at the next one, "B."  Knocks.  Hears nothing but the muted tv from apartment "A."  Pulls out his gloves. 
INT. WALTER BYRD'S APARTMENT - DAY 
With a CLICK the door swings open.  Will, gloves on, pockets his credit card.  Hears the CHING CHING of dog collars as 
TWO LABRADOR RETRIEVERS stand at attention, GROWLING.  Will's prepared.  Takes a bag of treats from his pocket. 
WILL Lucy.  Desi. 
The dogs break.  Trot over to him.  Wolf down the treats. Will scans the place.  Small, cheap.  Matching sofa and easy chair, corduroy upholstery.  The walls, lined with old 1950s movie posters.  All second-rate detective movies:  "Another Shot in the Dark," "Lady Luck," "He wore a Black Hat." 
Will walks across the room.  Repulsed.  The pathetic hovel of a killer.  Looks into the 
BEDROOM 
Single bed.  Books and magazines.  A half-eaten tuna sandwich on the bedside table.  "NYPD BLUE" calendar on the wall. 
It's quiet.  He walks over to a large DESK by the window. Scattered papers.  Computer.  Mini cassette recorder. 
On the wall, hundreds of newspaper articles.  Some yellowing, some fresh.  All about cops: "Officer Louis Saved My Life!" "Shoot-out in Soho," "South Street Cop Takes Down Drug Ring," "Seattle Cop Killed by Suspect..." 
Will curls his lip.  Starts looking through the papers on the desk.  Underneath a stack, he finds an 8x10 PHOTOGRAPH.  It's of Byrd, standing in front of a big, lakeside HOUSE.  A RADIO TOWER in the background.  Walter Byrd's face is blurred, turned to the side.  The photo from the book bio. 
Will takes it.  Starts roughly opening drawers.  A box of animal crackers, a rubber band ball.  Then, shoved in the back of the top drawer, an APPOINTMENT BOOK.  Will flips through to today's date.  Blank.  Shoves the book into his pocket.  Slams the door closed. 
Then reaches back for his Smith 39/13.  Checks the magazine. Slaps it back in place.  He's ready. 
SUDDENLY the phone RINGS.  A beige rotary on the desk. Plugged into an ancient answering machine.  It RINGS again. The answering machine WHIRS.  Then BEEPS. 
WALTER'S VOICE Now you're mad at me. 
Will freezes. 
WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd) ...I spotted your car around the corner. You must have been in a hurry.  Put some pieces together.  Don't worry, I would have done the same thing... 
Will turns back to the window.  Looking furiously... 
WALTER'S VOICE (cont'd) Anyway... (blows nose) ...I'm not coming home.  So you shouldn't wait there all day.  I mean, they'll wonder about you at the station. You should be careful about following procedure, Will, especially now that... 
Will lunges for the phone.  Snatches it up just as CLICK! the tape cuts off. 
WILL Goddammit! 
Enraged, he PUNCHES the receiver through the wall. 
INT. HALLWAY - APARTMENTS - DAY 
Will exits the apartment.  Cradling his hand.  Looks down at the tile floor.  Scanning it for a broken tile.  Finds one. Bends down and plucks out a broken corner. 
Places it carefully where the bottom of the door meets the door jamb.  Just then.  His BEEPER goes off. 
INT. BULLPEN - NIGHTMUTE PD - DAY 
Will strides into the bullpen.  Wounded hand in pocket. Ellie hunts and pecks at a typewriter.  Glances up. 
Fred, over in the corner.  SLAMS a drawer in the filing cabinet.  Turns. 
FRED Forget your pager? 
WILL What? 
FRED I beeped you over two hours ago. 
Holds out a one-page report. 
FRED (cont'd) Got a fax from the lab.  Murder weapon was a 357 Ruger. 
Will takes the report.  Heads over to the coffee machine. 
WILL Good. 
FRED And something else that might interest you. 
He reaches into his desk drawer and pulls out a book.  Holds it up.  Otherwise Engaged.  In hardback. 
FRED (cont'd) Remember this? 
Will blinks. 
WILL No. 
FRED One of the paperbacks we found in Kay Connell's knapsack.

GORT How's your gout? Nion rubs his leg. 
NION Better. Gort's look goes from Nion to Snow White. 
GORT You don't think it has anything to do with... 
NION How much have you had to drink?! The huntsman drains the last few drops of his rum when BEITH approaches, sitting beside him gruffly. 
BEITH Fleecing us of all our rum, eh huntsman? 
ERIC What do you say, we let bygones be bygones? 
BEITH Not yet, nut-hook. What's in it for you? (off Eric's innocent expression) I'm talking about the girl? Is it really just the gold? 
(CONTINUED) 
130 CONTINUED: (4) 130 Eric watches Snow White dancing with Gus, then shrugs. 
ERIC I'm not sure, Beith. If I had any sense I'd have abandoned her long ago. Beith eyes Eric as he watches Snow White dance. 
BEITH Muir says she's destined. Question is, huntsman, for whom? Gus and Snow White are still dancing. 
GUS (As Snow White treads on his toes) You don't mind me saying, you got two left feet for a princess. 
SNOW WHITE I don't mind at all, Gus. I haven't danced in a long, long while. She feels eyes on her - turns to see the huntsman watching her with a slight smile. She smiles back and breaks away. 
SNOW WHITE Do you mind, Gus? 
GUS Not at all. Snow White walks over to the Huntsman, holds out her hand. 
SNOW WHITE You've taught me to fight, surely I can teach you to dance. Eric trades a look with Beith, who nudges him on. Eric stands and they proceed to dance, with her teaching. 
SNOW WHITE Palms up, head straight, look me in the eyes. And... The huntsman moves better than you'd imagine. His face even softens as they both enjoy the dance. Beith looks on with a smile. 130a OMITTED 130a 
131 EXT. STONE RUINS/ GROVE/ ENCHANTED FOREST - DAWN. 131 
Eric and the dwarves are asleep. Flowers have grown around them, as if they've been asleep for months. Cull and Duir sleep sitting up, back to back, at the ready. 
(CONTINUED) 
131 CONTINUED: 131 Muir, also awake and smiling, sits against the log, his hand rubbing his son's sleeping head. Snow White sits amazed, drinking in the sights and sounds. Animals emerge from the forest -- SQUIRRELS, BEAVERS, FOXES, BIRDS. Slowly they make their way towards the ruins, gazing at Snow White. 
THE NIGHT SHIMMERS WITH FAIRY LIGHT AS THEY OBSERVE HER. Snow White feels the light on her face and to her surprise, she sees the two MAGPIES who watched over her at the castle. Two BEAUTIFUL FAIRIES WITH THE DEER EYES slip out of the magpies' bodies, beaming at her. As Snow White sits up, they direct her to the woods WHERE A DAZZLING LIGHT SHINES THROUGH A TREE. As she walks animals fall in alongside her. A little way away, Gus snores in his sleep. The golden light crosses his face and he wakes up. As he opens his eyes, he stares in wonder, then quickly wakes the other dwarves. They all stare in amazement now, even the blind MUIR. Eric is the last to wake up, wondering what the fuss is all about. They rise and follow to -- 
AT THE TREE She stands BENEATH THE GIANT TREE, facing a MAJESTIC WHITE HART. The air around the mystical creature shimmers with a golden light. 
BEITH No one's ever seen it before. The excited Muir grabs his son Quert by the arm. 
QUERT The white hart bows before the princess, father. Sure enough, the HART lowers its head before Snow White. Muir's face is lit up in the golden light, his blind eyes shining. 
MUIR It's blessing her. 
ERIC What are you talking about? 
MUIR You have eyes, huntsman, but do not see. You who have been with her the longest. Eric doesn't understand. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MUIR She is life itself. She will heal the land. She is the one. 
GORT So you're saying she is destined?... Muir can only shake his head. 
MUIR No one listens to me. 
(BEAT) Can't you feel it? Are you ailments not gone? Gold or no gold, where she leads I follow.

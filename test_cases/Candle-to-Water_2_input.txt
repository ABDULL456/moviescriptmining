Then: 
BROOKE VO (phone filter) There's never been anyone like you, since you. I love you Vaughn. I love you like no-one else ever has, or could. I'm not going to try to persuade you. Just follow your heart. OK? 
FADE IN ON 
1.01 INT. SALOON CAR ­ EVENING 
The car is stuck in rush-hour traffic, which surrounds VAUGHN (40), as he wrestles with the hardest decision of his life. 
He speaks into the car mobile phone kit microphone. 
VAUGHN I don't know. I mean I want you, I want to be with you. You know that. It's just . . . 
He glances at his mobile phone in its car kit dash cradle. The display says `OFFICE'. The lights of cars outside illuminate the falling snow, which is beginning to settle on the road. 
He waits. No response. No need for one. 
VAUGHN Can you . . . just give me twenty four hours ­ OK? 
Beat. The dashboard lights seem swirl around him. Stress. 
BROOKE OS (phone filter) Are you lost? You sound lost. 
VAUGHN Thought I'd try a new way home. Beat the traffic, you know. 
He looks at the sea of cars around him sardonically. 
BROOKE OS (phone filter) A little girl fell in love with a little boy. Still falling over here! 
Her laughter sounds loud on the car phone speakers. 
VAUGHN OK ­ I'll call you, babe. OK? 
Beat. The dashboard lights. Snow. Rush hour. Stress. 
His satnav sounds bizarrely loud, suddenly: 
SATNAV VOICE In point two of a mile, keep right . . . 
BROOKE (laughter, phone filter) See ­ even she's on my side! (beat) I love you Vaughn. Once upon a time. 
Vaughn takes a deep breath, loathes the traffic outside. 
His phone display indicates another incoming call: `Mia'. 
VAUGHN I love you too. I gotta. . . I'll call you ­ OK. Bye baby. 
BROOKE OS (phone filter) Another call. Is it her? 
VAUGHN (hesitant) Yes. 
BROOKE OS (phone filter) I guess you better take it. 
2|Page Vaughn looks at the incoming call display message. His finger hovers between the `accept' or `reject call' buttons. 
VAUGHN I have to go. I'll call you. . . 
BROOKE OS (phone filter) I know. I figured. 
VAUGHN What does that mean? Look you know how it is. I'll see you very soon. Always ­ OK? Ciao baby.

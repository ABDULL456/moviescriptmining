KHABAROV (CONT'D) Few ever escape the camps. I've waited for someone like you, someone with the strength and will to see it through. 
JANUSZ 
(EXCITED) Can't go West - apart from the Soviets, there's the Germans. East? All Soviet right to the Pacific.. .it would have to be South? KHABAROV nods, beams at him like a teacher with a very bright pupil. 
JANUSZ (CONT'D) They marched as due North from the railway, I glimpsed a lake, but I have no idea where we are. KHABAROV squats down, JANUSZ joins him, and smoothing out a drift of snow KHABAROV sketches a map of a lake and indicates the location of the camp. 
KHABAROV We believe about 500 kilometers north of Lake Baikal. 
JANUSZ We could follow the edge of the Lake, it runs due South. 
KHABAROV 
(NODDING) Then on to the Trans-Siberian Railway. Cross that and you're close to the Mongolian border. And freedom.

26 CONTINUED: ( 2) 26 JANUSZ's eyes burn with excitement. KHABAROV takes his arm, as if drawing energy from the younger man. 
KHABAROV (CONT'D) Spring is already upon us. It would have to be next autumn. 
JANUSZ Why wait? 
KHABAROV It's 1000 kilometers to the border, maybe more. We need careful planning, stock-pile food. I've already begun - trading, dealing. You could do the same. In the Autumn the weather is predictable. We need the early snows to cover our tracks. JANUSZ nods. 
JANUSZ What about my friends? 
KHABAROV If you trust them. But they won't all survive. 
JANUSZ But they'd die free men. KHABAROV offers his hand, and they shake. 
A27 INT. BARRACK - NIGHT A27 
KHABAROV and JANUSZ enter, having buried the shirt in the snow. KHABAROV indicates LAZAR, sitting on a bunk , and whispers. 
KHABAROV That's Lazar. He was architect. In Kiev.Now he is grave robber - me too. (Whispers) We sneak out at night.Through the wire. He moves away. 
27 EXT. CAMP - DAWN 27 
To the echoing clang of the hammer and iron, JANUSZ and KHABAROV hurry to where they buried their clothing.

27 CONTINUED: 27 CLOSE on the tips of the cloth showing above the snow - a teeming mound of lice on each. WIDER, as they shake their clothing free of the lice, and hurry over to join the assembly of prisoners at the kitchen servery window for their meagre breakfast ration. At the same time the morning ritual of carrying out the bodies of those who have died overnight is underway. The corpses are stacked like cords of wood for burial. JANUSZ pauses, a muttered prayer on his lips. Then he's passing the hospital barracks - the usual crowd of desperately ill prisoners hoping to be admitted, to be excused another day of the killing work, the majority turned away. He joins the line at the kitchen. The days' bread ration is being weighed and issued. If not exactly 500 grams a little is added or subtracted, the cook keeping trimmed slices, placing them in a tin. 
28 EXT. THE ZONE/CAMP EXTERIOR - DAWN 28 
Having been counted once, inside the camp, the brigade of prisoners is marched outside the gates where the armed guards who will escort them to work are waiting. GUARD NO. 1 begins counting them again. It's much colder than usual, prisoners beating their arms to keep warm, a high wind blowing. Khabarov stands with JANUSZ. 
KHABAROV Temperature is dropping. Below 60 they're not supposed to send us out. Know how to tell the temperature? You see frosty fog - it's 40 below. If you exhale easily but in a rasping fashion? 50 below. When your spit freezes? More than 60 below. He hoiks and spits. Close on the ball of spit mid-air. Freeze-frame. It's a solid glittering crystal of ice.

A30 EXT. ROAD THROUGH FOREST - DAY A30 
The freezing wind has picked up considerably, driving sleet against the column of prisoners, forcing them to a halt in an open snow-covered area. The column halts, the guards anxiously confer - 'to go back or continue on'? The prisoners shiver in the biting cold, some collapse, their fellow prisoners unwilling or unable to help them. JANUSZ and his friends find themselves near SMITH and watch as he hails a GUARD. 
SMITH (Shouts in Russian) We need to make shelter. 
GUARD NO. 1 Who asked you? 
SMITH We'll freeze to death in less than an hour. 
GUARD NO. 1 I couldn't give a fuck if you drop dead right now.

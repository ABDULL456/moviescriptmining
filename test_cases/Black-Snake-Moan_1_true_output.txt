Laz sits next to her and takes the guitar from her. 
LAZARUS (playing a tune) How you feelin' today? 
RAE You know how you feel when you come out of a bad hangover? Like your eyes can open a little bit more. 
LAZARUS I know that. 
RAE Woke up real early. Sun was shining. Just thought I'd mess around, try to learn a song. 
LAZARUS Go'on and sing it, I'll play. 
RAE No, you do it. I can't sing. 
LAZARUS Stop that foolishness. Just do as I say and close your eyes. (Rae closes her eyes) Close your eyes. And think about... well, for a song like this, I'd say you think about what you love. 
RAE What I love. 
LAZARUS Get a good picture in your mind. 
Rae's playful smile turns serious. Laz continues playing. 
LAZARUS Think on that. And sing wit me. (Laz comes in singing) You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. 
RAE & LAZARUS You make me happy when skies are gray. You'll never know dear, how much I love you. Please don't take my sunshine away. 
Rae opens her eyes with a delightful giggle. Laz continues playing. 
LAZARUS Good. I know another. It go like this. (sings) Last night dear, as I lay sleeping. I dreamed I held you in my arms. When I awoke dear, I was mistaken. So I hung my head and I cried. (to Rae) Close your eyes Rae... sing it. 
Rae doesn't hesitate to obey. With her eyes closed and Laz playing, neither can see Ronnie creeping up from the kitchen with his gun. 
RAE (singing) You are my sunshine. My only sunshine. You make me happy when skies are gray. 
Ronnie looks sick with pain as he points the barrel at the back of Laz's head. 
RAE (singing) You'll never know dear, how much I love you. Please don't take your sunshine away. (opens her eyes) RONNIE! 
Laz spins around knocking away Ronnie's arm. BAM! The gun fires into the wall. The guitar cracks on the floor. 
Rae screams. 
RAE RONNIE STOP! RONNIE! 
Laz lunges at Ronnie but Ronnie is faster. He spins Laz around and slams him to the floor, pushing his gun into Laz's face. 
RAE NO! 
Ronnie looks up at Rae, his eyes red with sorrow and rage. He pushes the gun to the side of Laz's head. Rae cries. 
RONNIE Ain't been a week and you already some nigger's whore? Gill told me. Told me how you and he... you and everybody... 
RAE Ronnie. Please, baby... 
RONNIE (to Laz) Did 'ya have fun with her? Sweet as a peach, I bet. Huh? Huh? 
Laz glares back, not saying a word. 
RONNIE Goddamn it, I ask you a question, you better answer it, or I'm gonna blast a hole in ya! 
RAE Ronnie... 
Rae moves closer. Ronnie points his gun at her and screams. 
RONNIE YOU SHUT UP! 
LAZARUS Careful how you point that gun, boy. 
RONNIE (points gun back at Laz) Or what? OR WHAT? 
LAZARUS Boy? You here to make a point, or you here to kill somebody? 
RONNIE Ain't gonna be callin' me boy when I blow your face off. 
LAZARUS You sayin' you'll do what? 
RONNIE You heard me, mother-fucker. I'll fuckin' kill.. 
LAZARUS (cutting him off) BOY! You so green you couldn't stomp a baby duck. 
Ronnie can't believe what was just said -- mostly, because it's true. The gun begins to shake in his hand. 
RONNIE You testing me? Huh? You testin' me, old man?

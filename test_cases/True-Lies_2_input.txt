HELEN As much as you used to? 
HARRY No. (she deflates) Much more. 
She looks into his eyes, and knows he is telling the truth. 
HELEN                                        * (grinning)                                        * It wore off. 
At that moment, they hear yelling from the cinder-block building. 
HARRY They found the bodies.  Come on-- 
249   EXT. SWAMP - NIGHT 
Harry takes her hand and they sprint for cover at the edge of the mangrove swamp.  A LIGHT HITS THEM.  TWO TERRORISTS, running around the corner, open fire with AK47s just as Harry and Helen reach a cluster of palm trees.  The trunks explode     * with bullet hits as they run through the darkness.               * 
As the two terrorists move through the trees, Harry lunges from  * the shadows and grabs one from behind.  He wrests his rifle      * away and swings it at the other, knocking his AK down.  The      * first terrorist draws a knife and slashes at him, but Harry grabs his knife arm and swings the blade into his partner. Then he elbow smashes the first guy and seizes him in a two- hand neck-breaker-- SNAP. 
Two more run around the corner of a building.  Harry stomps his  * foot down on one of the AKs, which is lying across a log.  It    * flips into the air and he catches it in firing position .  .     * .  and takes them out with two well-aimed bursts.  Helen comes   * out of the shadows staring at Harry in amazement.  His shirt is ripped, he is scratched and bleeding, holding an assault rifle   * expertly and scanning the brush like a feral animal.             * 
HELEN I married Rambo.                                       * 
He grabs her and kisses her passionately. 
HARRY Let's go. thru   OMITTED                                                          * 
254   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
LOOKING DOWN FROM A CATWALK on the activity below the four horsemen statues and several utility trucks almost fill the floorspace.  A rental truck is being loaded with conventional weapons, including machine guns and several HAND-LAUNCHED STINGER MISSILES.  One of the nukes has been lowered into a pit cut in the concrete floor.  Malik and most of the terrorists are gathered around it. 
A GUARD, F.G.  on the catwalk, watches intently from the railing.  So intently that he doesn't head Harry sneak up on him.  SNAP.  Harry catches the guard's MAC-10 machine pistol before it can hit the floor.  He and Helen crouch behind a steel pillar, watching the proceedings below.  Helen keeps glancing at the dead guard, killed so effortlessly a moment before by her husband.  It is all surreal. 
BELOW, MALIK is shouting in his native language.  He pulls a chain from around his neck and holds up a METAL ARMING KEY. Then jumps down into the pit and inserts it into the warhead's arming computer.  Harry is listening intently, translating for Helen. 
HARRY In ninety minutes a pillar of                          * holy fire will rise at this place                      * as a sign to out enemies.                              * (Malik theatrically turns the arming key) It is done... 
Malik jumps out of the pit.  He signals and terrorists pour concrete into the pit, covering the bomb.  He begins ranting again. 
HARRY Now no man can stop us.  We are set on our course.  No force can stop us... (as libbing) ... we're cool, we're badass, blah blah. 
255   INT. WAREHOUSE - DOWN BELOW - NIGHT 
Malik raises his fist and chants some Crimson Jihad slogans. The terrorists echo and chant and then cheer, firing their guns in the air.  Harry pulls Helen back as ricochets clatter all over the inside of the metal building. 
Malik shouts something and all the terrorists go back to work at double time.  They are loading warheads Two and Three onto trucks (one per truck) and the last, number Four, is being wheeled out on a cart to the Aerospatiale outside. 
256   INT. WAREHOUSE - ON CATWALK - NIGHT 
HELEN If we're on an island, why are they using trucks? 
HARRY We must be in the Florida Keys .                       * .  .  the Overseas Highway                             * connects the islands to the mainland. 
HELEN                                        * So there's no border, no customs.                      * They can just drive anywhere they                      * want .  .  .  there's nothing to                       * stop them .  .  . 
HARRY Just us. 
HELEN What are you going to do? 
HARRY (shrugs, like: what do you think?) Go down there and kill everybody, I guess. 
He hands her the MAC-10.  She holds it clumsily. 
HELEN Oh shit. 
HARRY Wait here.  If you have to use this, use it.  Don't choke. Okay? 
She nods gamely and Harry starts down the steel stairs to the floor below. 
257   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT 
ON HARRY, reaching the floor.  He slips behind some packing crates.  Then swings into action-- He hurls the grenade as hard as he can, down to the other end of the building.  KABOOM!!  He uses the distraction to move forward.  But it goes wrong almost right away...  A TERRORIST comes around a corner behind him, shouts-- Harry dives for cover as the guy fires, but-- He trips on a pipe and goes sprawling-- Losing the AK47, which slides under some equipment and-- Seven terrorists run toward him, with guns raised. 
HARRY (to Helen) SHOOT!! 
258   INT. WAREHOUSE - CATWALK - NIGHT 
HELEN fires a burst at the terrorists, actually hitting one! But-- The recoil knocks her back, into a metal column, and the gun 
FLIES OUT OF HER HANDS. It falls to the metal steps and hits-- Going off.  B-B-BLAM! The burst kills two more terrorists, and-- The Mac-10 cartwheels and hits further down.  ANOTHER BURST.  Another terrorist is splattered. 
It spins and hits another step-- ANOTHER RANDOM BURST MIRACULOUSLY KILLS THE LAST TWO TERRORISTS!! 
She has inadvertently saved her husband.  Harry looks up from behind cover-- to see all seven dead.  Now it's his turn to be amazed.  He signals to her to run... get off the exposed catwalk.  She makes it through the door to the outside stairs as bullets start hitting the steel walls behind her. 
259   INT. WAREHOUSE - MAIN FLOOR - NIGHT 
A TERRORIST with a knife runs at the unarmed Harry.  Harry snatches up a jack-hammer and BRAT-TAT-TAT-- Drives it into the guy's chest.  Then he-- Grabs an AK from one of the fallen terrorists and opens fire.  Malik shouts to the drivers of the trucks to get going.  The other terrorists return fire at Harry-- Who sprints from cover to cover, reaching a side door-- Where he rakes one of the passing trucks with a burst-- But terrorists behind him in the building have a clear shot and rounds hit the wall next to him as he-- Dives through the door-- 
260   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT 
--landing outside.  He takes cover behind an aircraft REFUELING TRUCK.  Not a good place.  He is pinned down by automatic weapons fire.  He looks around for Helen, who is--

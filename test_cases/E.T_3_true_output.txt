A group of the aliens work in front of the spacecraft. Suddenly, they hear a dog howl, and they all stop working. Red lights begin to glow in their chests. It appears as if their hearts have lit up at the sign of danger, as the red glow seeps through their translucent skin. After a moment the red lights dim and they return to their work. 
[This sets up the prop of the red-lights signifying danger. These small creatures are endearing and non-threatening. They are like children, which is immediate grounds for audience empathy. The thought that they may be in danger from wild creatures in the forest, also creates empathy for them.] 
EXT: FOREST: NIGHT 
A small fern grows on the forest floor. An alien hand, with two fingers protruding, reaches out for the fern. The alien groans. A rabbit turns and listens. The fingers dig up the plant as the rabbit watches. The alien then carefully uproots the plant. A small wayward alien walks alone among the gigantic redwood trees. He's dwarfed by the huge trees. 
[The awesome towering trees psychologically creates audience empathy for the creature. The audience identifies with him because they too feel small when confronted by these trees.] 
EXT: HILLTOP: NIGHT 
The creature stands alone on a hilltop as he stares down at the city lights below. Suddenly he lets out a moan of fright. A truck, with headlights glaring, pulls up next to him. 
[The quiet, peaceful alien is now in jeopardy.] 
The creature runs from the lights. Several other trucks with head- lights glaring drive up. Smoke flows from their exhaust pipes. Men's legs are seen as they walk among the trucks. They step into a mud puddle as E.T. watches from behind a shrub. A man with keys jangling from his waist walks past a headlight. He carries a flashlight in his hands. 
[Keys have now become a prop which identifies the antagonist of the story: the faceless government agent. Like the antagonist of many other fantasy films, his face is not initially revealed in order to hold the audiences attention.] 
The man with keys walks to a truck where he and two other men review a map that's placed on the hood of the truck. The man with keys holds the flashlight up and points it at the hood. E.T watches them from the bushes. 
[The fact that E.T. is observing the actions of the men also creates a psychological bond between the audience and him, since they are also observing these characters.] 
[While the audience doesn't actually see a map, they presume its existence given the actions of the characters. This style of story telling engages the audience, and gets them guessing about the characters' actions. They then create expectations, which are later often proved to be wrong. This makes the story both unpredictable and exciting.] 
EXT: SPACESHIP: NIGHT 
An alien stands in front of a round light and transmits a homing signal, presumably to call the other aliens back to the ship. 
[These characters are all in jeopardy.] 
EXT: FOREST: NIGHT

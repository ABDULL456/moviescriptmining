Nassor enters the mausoleum and attaches two clips onto the grave of Collosus. He exits the mausoleum and sends four Mylar balloons off into the sky. 
EXT.   TOSHIAKI'S BACKYARD - CONTINUOUS 
Toshiaki exits the gardening shed and walks over to his bundle. He attaches two clips and hooks these up to a kite by using a series of extension cords. 
INT.   WEIRD GIRL'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
We pull back through a skylight to see Mr Whiskers delivering a dead bat to Weird Girl who sits on her bed combing her doll's hair. Weird Girl's room is impossibly girly with pink fluffy flowers all around. 
She untwists metal coat hangers and attaches them to each other, making a long lightning rod. 
She lays the bat on her bed and attaches two   clips to its wings. She then grabs a large butterfly wall   hanging from above her bed. She attaches the butterfly to   the coat hanger pole and solemnly feeds it out of the   window into the night sky. 
The balloons, butterfly and kite can be seen floating over New Holland in the storm.

Motioning with his hands, Burgemeister signals for bigger applause but a big clap of THUNDER gets everyone's attention - 
And then lightning strikes.

Lightning hits the propped-up pool skimmer, then CRACKLES across the surface of the pool. 
Bob leaps back blinded by the light.

The lightning strikes the school building, SURGING through the power line to the electrodes on the rat.         We see the flattened sections start to balloon out. 
EXT.   SKY ABOVE THE CEMETERY - NIGHT 
The Mylar balloons are FRIED by lightning. The balloons burst, sending the surge hurtling down towards the mausoleum.

EXT. TOSHIAKI'S YARD - NIGHT 
Lightning surges down from the heavens, striking the disinterred bundle. The turtle bundle explodes. Toshiaki ducks for cover into the garden shed.

He starts licking his paws when suddenly --

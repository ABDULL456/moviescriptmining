GUY (quickly) Marrying the senator's daughter has nothing to do with it. Can't a fellow look past a tennis not without being a goldbricker? 
BRUNO Take it easy, boy. I'm your friend, remember? I'd do anything for you. 
GUY (humoring Bruno) Sure, Bruno, sure. (MORE)

GUY (CONT'D) (glancing at his watch) We'll be pulling in soon. I've got to change trains. 
BRUNO What'd you say her name was -- your wife's? 
GUY Miriam. 
BRUNO That's it. Miriam Joyce Haines. Played around a lot, I suppose? GUY Let's not talk about it any more. 
BRUNO (almost hopefully) Maybe she'll make more trouble for you. 
GUY I don't think so. 
BRUNO You mean you got enough on her to get your divorce no matter what? 
GUY Let's change subject, Bruno, can't we? 
BRUNO Okay, Guy. Want me to tell you one of my ideas for murdering my father? 
GUY (indicating the detective novels) You've been reading too many of these. 
BRUNO (going right on) You want to hear about the busted light socket in the bathroom, or the carbon monoxide in the garage? 
GUY No. I may be old fashioned, but I thought murder was against the law.

BRUNO But not against the law of nature. My theory is that everybody is a potential murderer. Didn't you ever want to kill somebody? Say one of those useless fellows Miriam was running around with? 
GUY You can't go around killing people just because you think they're useless. 
BRUNO Oh, what's a life or two? Some people are bitter off dead, Guy. Take your -- wife and my father, for instance. It reminds me of a wonderful idea had once. I used to put myself to sleep at night -- figuring it out. Now, let's say you want to get rid of your wife. 
GUY Why? 
BRUNO Let's say she refuses to give you a divorce -- (raises a finger and stops Guy's protest) Let's say. You'd be afraid to kill her because you'd get caught. And what would trip you up? Motive. Now here's the plan... 
GUY I'm afraid I haven't time to listen. 
BRUNO (ignoring the remark) It's so simple, too. A couple of fellows meet accidentally, like you and me. No connection between them at all. Never saw each other before. Each of them has somebody he'd like to get rid of, but he can't murder the person he wants to get rid of. He'll get caught. So they swap murders. 
GUY Swap murders?

BRUNO Each fellow does the other fellow's murder. Then there is nothing to connect them. The one who had the motive isn't there. Each fellow murders a total stranger. Like you do my murder and I do yours. 
GUY (with relief) We're coming into my station. 
BRUNO For example, your wife, my father. Criss-cross. GUY (sharply) What? 
BRUNO (with a smile) We do talk the same language -- don't we, Guy? 
GUY (preparing to leave) Sure, we talk the same language. Thanks for the lunch. 
BRUNO (beaming) I'm glad you enjoyed it. I thought the lamb chops were a little overdone myself. 
He holds out his hand.   Guy is in a hurry but he shakes hands. 
GUY Nice meeting you, Bruno. 
BRUNO (detaining him at the door) You think my theory is okay, Guy? You like it? 
GUY Sure, sure, Bruno. They're all okay. (he salutes a quick goodbye and hurries away)

Left alone, Bruno picks up Guy's lighter from the table, starts to call Guy back to hand It to him.Then he looks closer at the insignia of crossed tennis rackets. 
BRUNO (smiling) Criss-cross.

BAGGAGE MAN (smiling) Guy Haines! Good to too you, boy. You be sure to win at Southampton tomorrow, hear me? I've got two dollars on your nose. 
GUY (indicating his suitcase and rackets) Then park these in a lucky spot for a few hours, will you? 
BAGGAGE MAN Sure thing. 
He loads them onto a truck.

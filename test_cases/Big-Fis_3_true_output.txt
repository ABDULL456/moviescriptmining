EXT. FURTHER ALONG - ROUGH PATH 
The road has narrowed to a rough path. Spikes of sunlight break through the thick canopy, catching particles in the air. Still, Edward WHISTLES. 
Coming around a bend, his PITCH DROPS as he sees thick, thorny vines growing across the path. He stops. For the first time, he realizes the birds have stopped singing. The forest is dead quiet. 
He looks back the way he came. It's tempting to go back. It would be easier to go back. But Edward presses on. 
He carefully steps through the thorns. His trouser legs catch on the barbs. We can hear the fabric TEAR. 
FURTHER ALONG 
A scratched and sweaty Edward waves off various STINGING BUGS flying at him, finally whipping off his hat to swat at them. 
Just then a CAWING crow swoops down and grabs the hat right out of his hands. 
EDWARD You stupid sonofa... 
He stops his swearing, but grabs a rock and throws it. The stone ricochets off a tree and into a BEE'S NEST. The swarm roars out. 
Edward high-tails it, each step still precarious. 
EXT. THE DARK FOREST - DAY [LATER] 
Edward is bruised, battered and bee-stung. 
A half-broken sign lies in the road. Edward picks it up. Reads it: 
WARNING! 
JUMPING SPIDERS! 
Sure enough, up ahead he sees the path is overgrown with thick cobwebs, heavy from the rain. 
EDWARD (V.O.) There comes a point where a reasonable man will swallow his pride and admit he's made a terrible mistake. The truth is, I was never a reasonable man. 
Edward tosses the sign and forges ahead, into the spiderwebs. 
EDWARD And what I recalled of Sunday School was that the more difficult something became, the more rewarding it was in the end. 
EXT. CLEARING / THE ROAD - DAY 
Edward emerges from the forest, brushing the last cobwebs off and shaking the spiders from his shirt. One is stuck in his sleeve, and he has to dance to get it out. Even then, he still keeps twitching, convinced another one is left behind. 
At his feet, the gravel road has returned, smooth and dusty and comforting. 
Ahead lies a tiny one-street town -- smaller even than Ashton -- with powerlines emerging from the woods to feed it. Dangling from the line above he sees two dozen pairs of shoes, their laces tied together. 
He passes a sign that reads "Welcome To Spectre!" 
EXT. THE TOWN OF SPECTRE - DAY 
It's a main street with stores on each side: Cole's Pharmacy, Talbot's Five and Dime, Al's Country Store. Everything is old, but this isn't a ghost town. In fact, there's a group of about 20 CITIZENS spilling out to see Edward approach. Most are smiling. There are even a few tears of joy. 
What's more, all of these people are barefoot. 
MAN'S VOICE Friend! 
A forty-year old man named BEAMEN comes out of the seed store to greet Edward. Friendly but a little drunk, he's the closest thing the town has to a mayor. He's carrying a clipboard. 
BEAMEN Welcome to ya. What's your name? 
EDWARD Edward Bloom. 
Beamen checks the clipboard. Not finding the name, he flips forward a few pages. Still looking... 
BEAMEN Bloom like a flower? 
EDWARD Yes. 
BEAMEN Oh. Here! Right here. Edward Bloom. We weren't expecting you yet. 
Still confused... 
EDWARD You were expecting me? 
BEAMEN Not yet. 
A helpful woman named MILDRED chimes in: 
MILDRED You must have taken a shortcut. 
EDWARD I did. It nearly killed me. 
BEAMEN Mmm-hmm. Life'll do that to you. And truthfully, the long way is easier, but it's longer. 
MILDRED Much longer. 
BEAMEN And you're here now, and that's what matters. 
Beamen's daughter JENNY (8) hides behind her father, peering around to look at the handsome stranger.

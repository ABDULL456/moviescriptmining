Coriolanus launches himself into the crowd with blistering 
ANGER: 
CORIOLANUS My nobler friends, I crave their pardons. For the mutable, rank-scented crowd, Let them regard me as I do not flatter, And therein behold themselves. I say again, In soothing them, we nourish against our 
SENATE The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition, Which we ourselves have ploughed for, sowed, and scattered, By mingling them with us! 
MENENIUS Well, no more! 
TITUS No more words, we beseech you-- The mob has surrounded them all by now. The police are getting nervous, eyes darting uneasily from the unruly crowd to the volatile men. This all has the potential of sparking to violence. We note a TV news crew moving into position, covering the action. Others film with cell phone cameras. We intercut some of this footage. 
BRUTUS (to Coriolanus, provoking) You speak of the people As if you were a god to punish, not A man of their infirmity. 
SICINIUS It were well we let the people know it. 
CORIOLANUS Were I as patient as the midnight sleep, By Jove, it would be my mind!

CORIOLANUS Thus we debase the nature of our seats, and make the rabble Call our cares fears; which will in time Break ope the locks of the Senate, and 
BRING IN The crows to peck the eagles! 
MENENIUS Come, enough! 
BRUTUS Enough, with over-measure. 
SICINIUS (calls to the mob) He has spoken like a traitor, and shall 
ANSWER As traitors do! At the word "traitor" Coriolanus loses all reason, he is 
FIRE: 
CORIOLANUS Thou wretch, despite overwhelm thee! 
BRUTUS Manifest treason! 
SICINIUS This is a Consul? No! 
CORIOLANUS Hence, old goat! Coriolanus grabs Sicinius roughly and flings him aside-- At this -- the crowd ROARS in outrage -- the TV crews hustle

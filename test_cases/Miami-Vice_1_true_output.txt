Montoya hangs up.  José Yero looks at the phone. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CLUB - CROCKETT + ISABELLA - NIGHT 
enter.  They join Tubbs and Gina. 
GINA 
sees Crockett's carriage with this woman.  It's different. Intuitively, she exchanges a look with Tubbs.  Crockett makes introductions.  Then, they move away to dance to a fast samba in perfect synchronicity.  And, they're also SEEN by... 
JOSÉ YERO 
He watches them, too.  His yellow eyes are lit by strobes. His eyes locked onto Isabella...dancing with Crockett, their bodies close... 
And in the way he looks at them, hurt, like a betrayed lover, which he isn't and never could have been...we know now, the core of his antagonism. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER, DINING AREA - TUBBS - DAY 
It's a 30 year old, well-maintained carribean freighter with a steel table and u-shaped bench.  In the dark interior, narrow spots reveal the group hovering over a ruggedized Workpad with navigational software. 
JOSÉ YERO Transshipment point is here at 17:00 hours on the 23rd. 
TUBBS Uh-uh.  No predetermined places and times to meet.  Give me their heading and radio codes and I will talk to them directly with the longs and lats and time which will be a last minute deal... 
JOSÉ YERO You give yours to me.  We position all the assets hauling our loads... 
CROCKETT Now how we do it, blood.  It risks signal interception and other bad things like people who don't need to know where we're at knowing. 
Tubbs hands José Yero's assistant, El Tiburon, a pager. 
TUBBS At ten to three on the 27th, I will satellite page him with a website and encryption code.  He will have ten minutes to log on and receive his new heading.  Ten minutes and thirty seconds, website disappears and he can drive his fucking boat up to Iceland... 
José Yero doesn't like it. 
JOSÉ YERO Malaysian registry.  Small containership. (to El Tiburon) Give them their codes and heading. 
Everything Yero tells them feels to him like exposure. 
CROCKETT Packaging? 
JOSÉ YERO Fifty-gallon drums.  Thirty-two.  A hundred kilos in each.  You transship that to the Malaysian boat. 
TUBBS Importation value?  At twenty-two thousand a ki... 
JOSÉ YERO You work that out with La Senora. (beat) You will get sixteen fuel bladders of crystal meth precursors from the Malaysian ship.  For collection in North Miami.  You warehouse it. Release it when we say. (beat) I'm sure you have friends with fast boats... 
CROCKETT If you see a few new faces, don't get jumpy... 
TUBBS And José, my ace, lots of transshipment.  Lots of action. Skies are crowded.  And the JIT has assets on land, air, and sea. (beat) So any intel you got that can come our way and contribute to the good and welfare...? 
José Yero's on the spot. 
JOSÉ YERO Sure.  Check your e-mail. 
Yero gets up and leaves the confined dining room.  He exits onto the walkway outside the bridge.  His path takes him past... 
EXT. HONDURAN FREIGHTER - TRUDY 
with Switek and Zito.  Trudy's in a tank top.  José looks at Trudy appreciatively... 
TRUDY 
returns the look with a stare that says, "Don't fuck with me".  José raises his eyebrow and after noting the two handguns holstered in the waistband of her hiphuggers... 
CUT TO: 
INT. LONG CARGO SHED - JOSÉ YERO + EL TIBURON 
walk.  Cochi Loco's security leads and tails behind as... 
JOSÉ YERO (to El Tiburon) You know what Escobar used to do?

REGGIE No, everyone. Come on -- avanti, avanti! 
She rises and pulls him along. 
WIDE ANGLE 
Including the dance floor as most of the patrons go to it, laughing self-consciously and looking around. 
EMCEE Écoutez bien -- les règles sont tres simples -- the rules are very easy -- deux équipes -- two teams -- each with one orange -- une orange -- eine apfelsine -- un' arrancia -- held under the chin, like so -- (does it) comme ça -- and passed to the player behind you -- sans vous servir de vos mains -- using nothing but the chin -- no hands -- and keeping the orange at all costs from touching the floor. Commencez, Mesdames et Messieurs -- begin, ladies and gentlemen -- signore e signori, comminciate! 
The EMCEE now circulates, forming teams, telling the patrons to line up, making sure there is a woman next to every man. REGGIE and PETER are the second couple in their line. 
Then the EMCEE picks up a basket of oranges and places one under the chin, held securely against the chest, of each man at the head of the line. Blowing a whistle, a signal for the game to begin and the band to play, the men turn to the women behind them and attempt to transfer the oranges from under their chins to under the chins of the women -- without using their hands. 
(This maneuver can only be accomplished by embracing one's partner passionately and firmly pressing the orange against the partner's throat until he or she can grip it tightly enough with the chin to turn and offer it to the person next in line, where the process begins anew. However, the slightest miscalculation, which can be brought about by any number of human frailties -- haste, modesty, inhibition or lack of co- ordination -- will surely result in losing control of the orange so that it either falls to the floor [where it can only be picked up by the chin] or it starts to roll and slide from its proper place to some other, less proper, spot on the human anatomy, forcing the man or the woman to retrieve it -- again, with the chin only. This latter is an activity which can prove extremely satisfying to old friends, or even new friends who wish to become old friends, but can only be a torment for total strangers and/or the English). 
VARIOUS SHOTS -- ORANGE GAME 
Some of the couples in various states of confusion, entanglement and intimacy -- all of them, naturally, hilarious. 
TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL 
It is his turn to take the orange from a very short, but quite shapely young girl in a strapless dress (held up by an abundance of cantilever). PETER 'takes' when he sees the twin obstacles which might -- and probably will -- encumber the game but increase his worldly experience. 
The contest begins: because of her stature he is forced to move in low, making the ordinary embrace needed for success difficult, if not impossible. Then, inexorably, the orange starts to slip down the GIRL's front. Manfully he goes after it. 
CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE 
She is enjoying it thoroughly. 
TWO SHOT -- PETER AND GIRL 
Bending over backwards, in a sort of frontal half-nelson, PETER makes a last valiant effort and voilà, grips the orange under his chin -- amid much cheering and congratulations from members of his TEAM. 
Now he turns to REGGIE and they face one another for a moment. 
PETER En garde. 
REGGIE Lay on, MacDuff. 
They go at it, working their bodies together to make it all possible. Then, for a moment, the game and the onlookers seem less important than their proximity. But, alas, they are too good despite themselves and the transfer is accomplished -- again with appreciative cheers from the TEAM. 
REGGIE, with the orange now tucked firmly under her chin, turns to the next team-member in line and is locked in an embrace before she realizes her partner is LEOPOLD GIDEON, the short, fat, balding man seen at the funeral and later in BARTHOLOMEW's photo. 
REGGIE starts to draw back but GIDEON holds her tightly. 
Putting his chin around the orange he is able to speak quietly in REGGIE's ear. 
CLOSE TWO SHOT -- REGGIE AND GIDEON 
Her eyes show her fright as he whispers: 
GIDEON Mrs. Lampert -- 
REGGIE What do you want? 
GIDEON Didn't Charles tell you, Mrs. Lampert? 
REGGIE Tell me what? 
GIDEON It doesn't belong to you, Mrs. Lampert -- you do know that, don't you? 
REGGIE I don't know anything. 
GIDEON Mrs. Lampert, any morning now you could wake up dead. 
REGGIE Leave me alone -- ! 
GIDEON Dead, Mrs. Lampert -- like last week's news -- like Charles, Mrs. Lampert -- 
REGGIE (SHOUTING) Stop it! 
CLOSE SHOT -- REGGIE'S AND GIDEON'S FEET 
As REGGIE hauls off and kicks GIDEON full in the shin. 
CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON 
He stiffens as the pain registers. Instead of shouting he merely closes his eyes. 
WIDER ANGLE 
Including REGGIE and GIDEON and PETER standing by, as well as some spectators. PETER comes quickly forward. 
PETER Reggie -- what's the trouble? 
REGGIE realizes that GIDEON no longer offers any resistance. 
She steps back, leaving GIDEON holding the orange, foolishly, under his chin, his eyes still closed. REGGIE stares at him for a moment. 
REGGIE He -- he was stepping on my foot. 
CLOSE SHOT -- GIDEON 
Slowly, his eyes open and tears stream from them, rolling down his cheeks. He speaks while holding the orange. 
GIDEON Forgive me -- it was quite unintentional, I'm sure. 
WIDER ANGLE 
GIDEON turns to the woman behind him and the game resumes. 
REGGIE (starting off) Wait for me -- I won't be long. 
She goes off toward the rear of the club and starts down a flight of stairs. 
CLOSE SHOT -- PETER 
Watching her go, a concerned look on his face. 
INT. NIGHTCLUB LOUNGE -- NIGHT 
A small, dimly lit area with a door to the combination men's- women's room and a 'phone cabin with a solid door. 
The music and shouting from upstairs float down. REGGIE comes down the stairs and goes to the 'phone, flicking on the light and closing the door after her. 
INT. PHONE BOOTH -- NIGHT 
REGGIE takes a jeton ('phone token) from her bag and drops it in the slot. Then she takes out a slip of paper (the one given her by BARTHOLOMEW) and dials the number written on it. She listens to it ring, then evidently he answers.

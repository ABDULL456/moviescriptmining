GRAYSON 
When you get through with him? 
76. DOUBLE SHOT 
ANNE 
Yes, it'll be a very interesting experiment. 
GRAYSON 
(sneering) 
To make a gentleman out of a tramp? 
ANNE 
Exactly. 
GRAYSON 
Now, Anne, you remember how much it cost to get rid of that baseball player? 
ANNE 
You don't seem to understand that this one's different. He has brains. 
77. MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Grayson seats himself beside her on the divan. 
GRAYSON 
(fervently) 
But what about me, Anne? 
She looks at him coldly with almost an expression of dislike. 
ANNE 
You? Oh, don't go serious on me, Dexter. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. PENTHOUSE APT. - NIGHT 
78. MED. SHOT TRUCKING 
An elaborate, modernistic roof apartment, thronged with people all in evening dress. Stew and Anne are walking down among them. Anne is radiant, and Stew is happily guiding her among the stuffed shirts. Anne stops before a group. There is the sound of conversation, laughter, clink of glasses, music from stringed invisible orchestra, etc. 
ANNE 
Hello, Natalie. Mr. Stewart Smith . . . Miss Montgomery, Mrs. Eames, Mrs. Radcliff, Mr. Radcliff 
STEW 
How-di-do. 
GROUP 
(ad-lib acknowledgements) 
79. MED. CLOSE SHOT - DEXTER GRAYSON 
Standing, helping himself to a cocktail, which a footman is passing about. Dexter looks off with a frown of disapproval. 
80. CLOSE SHOT - GROUP OF WOMEN 
They are looking off in Anne's direction. 
FIRST WOMAN 
Say, who's Anne's new boyfriend? 
SECOND WOMAN 
Well, if these old ears don't deceive me, I believe his name is Smith. 
FIRST WOMAN 
Smith! Can't be one of the brothers - he hasn't a beard on.[6] 
SECOND WOMAN 
Well, he must have something if Anne has got her clutches on him. 
There is the sound of a piano chord being struck. 
81. MED. FULL SHOT 
Mrs. Baxter, the hostess, is standing importantly by the grand piano at which is seated an anaemic-looking young man. Beside her stands a stout, swarthy Italian with bristling mustachios. Mrs. Baxter bows toward the swarthy one, who bends almost double in acknowledgement. There is a polite scattering of applause, and some of the guests seat themselves. 
Martini starts to sing. 
Unnoticed by the rest, Stew and Anne slip out of the door into the roof garden. 
EXT. ROOF GARDEN 
82. MED. FULL SHOT 
A most beautiful, romantic spot. Rose trees in blossom, a vine-covered pergola, a splashing fountain, a few choice marble statues, low, deep chairs placed to make a gorgeous spot. Stew and Anne enter from the direction of the house. The garden is dark except for the lights from the interior of the house. From within, comes the voice of the singer rendering an extremely romantic, sentimental Italian love song. This will continue to the FADE OUT of the scene. 
Stew and Anne walk, still hand in hand, toward the edge of the pergola where the shadows are deeper and where a couple of glorified steamer chairs are placed. There is a full moon overhead. 
She leads him toward a waterfall effect, a glass partition down which water trickles. They go behind the dimly lit fountain and sit 
in a low, deep divan. We see them in silhouette as they go into a passionate embrace. All we hear is the faint voice of Martiniand the uninterrupted splashing of the fountain. 
CUT TO: 
83. CLOSEUP - ANNE & STEW 
On divan, arms around each other. 
STEW 
Anne, pinch me, will you? Throw me out of here. Give me the air. Throw me out of this joint, will you? 
Anne smiles happily and pinches his nose. 
ANNE 
Why should I? We're happy, aren't we, darling? 
STEW 
Throw me out - because I'm beginning to get goofy ideas, and they concern you, Anne. 
ANNE 
(passionately) 
None of your ideas can be goofy, Stew, if they concern me. 
STEW 
(struggling) 
My name is Smith - well, that you seem to have been able to stand for the last month. I'm white, male and over twenty-one. I've never been in jail - that is, not often. And I prefer Scotch to Bourbon. I hate carrots, I hate peas, I like black coffee and I hate garters. I make seventy-five bucks a week and I've got eight hundred and forty-seven bucks in the bank - and - I don't know yet whether your eyes are blue or violet. 
ANNE 
(although he is very close to her) 
That's because you're too far away, Stew. 
Throughout his speech, Anne never takes her eyes off him. As he fumbles now, he turns. Their eyes meet. His overwhelming desire for Anne overcomes him. 
He dismisses as futile his effort to be practical, sweeps her into his arms and kisses her passionately.

She's alone here. Only her demons to keep her company- A long moment of. awful indecision passes,, Kate paralyzed. Then she looks up, her gaze moving past the wine glass to the window., Through it, she can see the backyard. It's the swimming pool that holds her eyes, its cold-surface rippling in the rain. But- she's seeing something else there, something awful. Impossible to know- what she's thinking, but whatever it Is, it moves her to action: 
She, abruptly grabs the glass and quickly empties it in the sink before she-can change hex mind. -Then she grabs the. open wine' bottle and pours it all down the drain. She runs the water and scrubs the sink with her fingertips, removing every trace. Tosses the empty bottle in the trash and ties up the garbage bag.

KATE You dropped them on purpose. 
ESTHER No, I didn't! I swear!. - Kate doesn't believe it for a second, but sees a CROSSING GUARD and a FEW KIDS hurrying to grab the paintings as they're carried off by the wind. Kate shoots Esther a dirty look, then sets the parking brake with an exasperated sigh and gets out to help...

INT. PLAYHOUSE - NIGHT 
In the moonlight, the joint's cherry burns hell-fire red. A couple of Polaroid buddy-shots sit at their feet. Brigitte tokes and passes the jay to Ginger.. 
BRIGITTE How'l1 you know when you finally get it any ways? 
GINGER Prob'ly feel like peein' your pants. 
BRIGITTE Disgusting. 
GINGER Well I'm not too excited. 
BRIGITTE, (checking her watch) We're missing Unsolved Mysteries. 
GINGER Wish I was an unsolved mystery. Brigitte reflects on this heavy thought, nodding - stoned. 
GINGER Hey. You smell somethin' gross? 
GINGER SNAPS - WALTON/July 15, 1996 22 
EXT. NEIGHBOR'S YARD - NIGHT 
The girls sniff around the playhouse. Ginger steps on something that makes an evil squeeshy sound. She skids and ends up on her ass. 
GINGER This is so not my day. Brigitte helps her to her feet. Ginger shakes what she slipped on off her shoe. It's a long, ropy intestine. She drags her shoe to get the blood and goo of it. 
GINGER Nice. Dog shit. 
BRIGITTE (thrilled to recognize the smell) That isn't shit... it's death. A line of blood and gore trails across the grass to a back lane. Brigitte follows it. Ginger looks around for something on the ground. 
GINGER Great. Lost the jay. Great. 
EXT. SERVICE LANE - NIGHT 
Ginger joins Brigitte, who's squatted before another dog's body. This one's a fresh kill. 
BRIGITTE Ack, it's still warm, gross. Brigitte takes its picture FLASH! with the Polaroid, which is strung around her neck. 
GINGER Why every dog but the mutt next door to us? 
BRIGITTE Hey, we could take it home. Try like, an autopsy. Like, crack the case! 
GINGER Nah. Let's put ' im in there so he won't. Lraumatize the kiddies. 
Ginger indicates a construction dumpster on the end of the lane. Disappointed, Bee rolls down her sleeves to cover her hands. Ginger does the same and they shovel the body onto their arms. They trot the dog over to the dumpster. Brigitte sulks. 
GINGER What. 
BRIGITTE We never do what I wanna do. 
GINGER Oh, c' mon. Would stink up the whole room! They hoist the dog up and dump it in the dumpster. It's hind end sticks out. Brigitte climbs into the dumpster, dragging it all the way in. Dusting herself off, Ginger notices some blood on her thigh.

Peggy embraces her mother, holding on for dear life, inhaling her scent. 
PEGGY Chanel Number Five. That always reminds me of home. 
MRS. KELCHER Of course, dear. You're home now. 
PEGGY I'm home now. 
INT. PEGGY'S ROOM 
Peggy enters warily, looking around, a fifties museum of teenage artifacts. She walks around the room gently touching her old belongings including the record player from opening scene. She looks in the mirror to make sure she's still there. Suddenly, she turns around. 
PEGGY Okay, I'm alone now. Is anyone here? 
She opens the closet door expectantly, then closes it shaking her head. 
PEGGY No. This is crazy. Is somebody going to tell me what's going on? Why me? What happened? You don't have to show up. I don't have to see you. Just send me a sign. (beat) Thanks a lot. 1 guess I'm on my own. 
NANCY, Peggy's twelveyearold sister, peeks in the room. 
PEGGY Nancy! Come here. 
Nancy tentatively approaches. Peggy hugs her. 
NANCY What are you doing? 
PEGGY I'm just happy to see you. 
NANCY Come on! Mom said you were sick. You're never happy to see me. 
PEGGY I'm sorry about that. I really want us to be closer. I have enough unresolved relationships in my... life. 
NANCY Teenagers are weird. And you're the weirdest. 
PEGGY Let's do something together.. Do you want to play Monopoly? Or Careers... Clue... Snakes and Ladders? 
NANCY (suspicious) Okay, what do you want? What dumb favor do you want me to do? 
INT. LIVING ROOM 
On a small black and white TV, Dick Clark introduces a spotlight dance. Peggy and Nancy are sitting on the sofa, watching. Nancy is eating small candies, like M&M's. 
PEGGY It's unbelievable. The man never ages. 
NANCY Look at Kenny Rossi. Isn't he dreamy? I wish he'd break up with Arlene. She thinks she's so great. 
PEGGY Don't eat the red ones. 
NANCY Why not? They're my favorite. 
PEGGY They're bad for you. They cause...red lips. (red dye *2) 
Nancy react, as Peggy stands. CAMERA TRACKS HER to the den. 
DEN 
Peggy opens the liquor cabinet and takes out a bottle of Scotch and a glass, noticing the family photos on the wall.. 
PEGGY Can't hurt. I'm already dead. 
She belts down several drinks. 
NANCY (Q.S.) Peggy Sue! Hurry up. Fabian! 
Peggy steadies herself as CAMERA TRACKS her back into the living room. 
LIVING ROOM 
Peggy collapses on the naugahyde recliner. Unexpectedly, it leans back, shooting Peggy's legs up. 
MRS. KELCHER (from the kitchen) I put your laundry on your beds. Don't forget to put it away. 
NANCY What's for dinner? 
MRS. KELCHER Meatloaf. 
NANCY Yeech, not again. 
Peggy leans forward in the recliner eating the candies. Bemused, she looks at Nancy watching TV and into the kitchen where her mother is slapping together meatloaf. 
ANGLE - HALLWAY - THE FRONT DOOR OPENS 
JACK KELCHER Peggy's father, enters the hallway. 
MR. KELCHER Girls? Evelyn? Who left this thing outside?

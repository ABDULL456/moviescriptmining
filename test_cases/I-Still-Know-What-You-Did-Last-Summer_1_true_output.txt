JULIE Not me...no way... 
WILL Come on, it'll be fun. 
KARLA Ladies and gentlemen, please put your hands together for my friend, my very best friend, Julie James. 
But there will be no mercy. 
KARLA, TYRELL, & WILL (chanting in unison) Ju-lie! Ju-lie! Ju-lie! 
Reluctantly she goes to the song book. She sees something particularily awful. 
JULIE You asked for it. (to Tyrell) Song number thirty-nine. 
Tyrell nods and punches a few buttons. Julie takes the stage as sappy strings begin to swell. She looks at the MONITOR, then melodramatically at the crowd, and begins to sing -- no, BELT -- Gloria Gaynor's "I WILL SURVIVE." 
JULIE (cont'd) (singing) First I was afraid...I was petrified... (continues singing under) 
Will stands, clapping. Tyrell pounds his chest. Karla flips up her LIGHTER, swaying like a hard-core fan. And Julie continues, crooning out the chorus as the beat kicks in and the gang begins to dance. 
JULIE (cont'd) (singing) I will survive...I will survive... 
ANGLE ON THE KARAOKE MONITOR 
The schmaltzy lyrics keep scrolling by -- white against black. But then...in the middle of the song...the color changes. RED CAPITAL\ LETTERS BEGIN TO FILL THE SCREEN. 
JULIE (cont'd) (singing -- then trailing off) And I still know...what you did... last summer... 
Her voice trails. Her smile abruptly fades. 
MICROPHONE 
falls to the floor. The room echoes with an electronic WHUMP. Everyone stops dancing, confused. 
CLOSE - JULIE 
trembling, shaking, a mess. Will jumps onstage. 
WILL Julie? What's wrong? 
JULIE It's...him. 
WILL What do you mean, Julie? 
JULIE He did something to the screen...it, it, said... 
Julie loos at the screen -- the normal lyrics are still scrolling. She suddenly feels their eyes upon her. They're looking at her like she's having a nervous breakdown. 
JULIE (cont'd) Nothing. Nothing, I'm sorry... 
Stung, she rushes off the stage. 
KARLA Julie... 
But it's to late. She's bolted from the bar. 
CUT TO: 
28	INT. HOTEL - JULIE'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Julie steps into her room. Closes the door behind her. She falls back against it, trying to calm herself down. 
JULIE There's no way...just stop it right now... 
She looks around the cozy room. 
JULIE (cont'd) Closet. Bed. Bathroom. No need to panic. 
Julie starts to undress, get ready for bed, the day of travel finally catching up with her. She grabs something to sleep in. Tosses it on the bed. And that's when she sees it, 
CLOSE - ENVELOPE 
propped on the pillows. Her name written across. She is frozen momentarily. 
Almost against her will, she moves toward the envelope. She reaches down and picks it up. 
She hesitates, then opens the envelope. She pulls out a SINGLE WHITE CARD. 
ANGLE ON THE CARD 
In bold print it reads: SURPRISE! 
DARKFIGURE 
appears over Julie's shoulder. Julie can feel the presence. She spins, scaring -- 
WILL 
who YELLS and drops the flowers and champagne he was holding. The bottle bursts and covers them with spray. 
JULIE (realizing) Oh, Will! I'm sorry. 
WILL It's my fault. I shouldn't have...I didn't think...

Away Talia scoots to catch up with the gang. 
MERCEDES TAINOT What do men see in irritating free spirits? Mercedes starts walking. 
LARRY CROWNE Seriously. I offer you a ride. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Seriously. I don't want one. Larry shuts off his scooter, pushing it along with his feet 
LARRY CROWNE I've yet to give anyone a lift on this but I think I can get you home with a scraped elbow, worst case. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I am walking, Crowne, as thoughts black boil up from my soul. Major 
consequences sure to follow. 
You'll read about them on Parsectwelve.com. 
LARRY CROWNE An attractive woman like you walking alone is a dumb idea. 
MERCEDES TAINOT I need a man flirting with me right now like I need a dog crapping on my lawn. I'm hoofing it. 
LARRY CROWNE In those shoes? Mercedes ponders her shoes. He's got her. She stops. 
MERCEDES TAINOT A man who notices shoes. 
(GIVING UP) All right. I'll be your Cycle Slut. 
LARRY CROWNE Put this on. 
(HIS HELMET) Strap your legs round my engine and 
MERCEDES TAINOT It won't be a terrible thing if you kill us both. 
LARRY CROWNE Ain't you a ball of fun? Larry kick starts the scooter and off they go -- slowly. 
IN MOTION 
MERCEDES TAINOT Are you really going to go this slow? 
LARRY CROWNE I do want to survive this night. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Fine. I have time to window shop. Oh look, a sale on tires at AutoUSA. And here comes a mailbox. I've never noticed their perfect design and colo scheme. This is 
so slow a cat could knock us over. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - MINUTES LATER. 
Here they come at the speed of a lazy cow. Mercedes is singing "Sixteen Miles on the Erie Canal". 
EXT. STREET - RIDING SHOT - LATER - ON THE SCOOTER 
Larry shouts over his shoulder. 
LARRY CROWNE Where am I taking you? 
MERCEDES TAINOT Down to Portola and left to Havenhurst. Havenhurst to Palermo. Right on Palermo till I yell stop. 
LARRY CROWNE I may use this as a presentation in class. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Try it and you'll flunk. I am joking. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. 
LARRY CROWNE I like your class. You're making us all do things we never thought we could. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Put the shovel away and just get me home, 'kay? Up ahead, flashing lights. 
MERCEDES TAINOT (CONT'D) Hail our City's Finest. 
LARRY CROWNE Someone's getting pinched... A COP CAR with its cherry top flashing, has pulled over a Drunk Driver. It's Dean. They're making him touch his nose, breathe into a test kit. Mercedes starts laughing. 
As they pass the crime scene, Dean is being put into the back 
of the Prowler, cuffed... 
Mercedes' laugh fills the night as they putt-putt along. 
MERCEDES TAINOT Measure his dick, officer! He's too diminutive to drive! 
(THEN) Tiny dick loser! Larry doesn't know what to make of that. 
LARRY CROWNE Bad night for that guy.

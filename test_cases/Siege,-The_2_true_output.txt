HUB'S UNMARKED CAR 
Elise sits, handcuffed, alone in the back seat. Up front, Frank is driving with Hub beside him. 
FRANK So, Elise... You okay back there, you don't get carsick or anything? Those handcuffs too tight --? 
ELISE Shouf mountains, right? Shiite or Sunni? 
FRANK Wow. You're really good. (to Hub) She's really good. 
HUB You ready to tell us what's going on here, Elise --? Was the paintbomb a warning? 
ELISE (to Haddad) American University of Beirut? I was there from '79 to 82. 
FRANK (a look to Hub) No shit? 
ELISE My father taught Economics. Henry Kraft? 
HUB Is there a terrorist cell operating in this city that we are unaware of? 
ELISE (ignoring him; to Haddad) Such a tragedy. Growing up in that city was... paradise. Like an exotic Paris, wasn't it, Frank --? 
HUB You ever been in Rikers, Elise? You know what happens in there? 
Elise looks at him, utterly unfazed by the threat. 
ELISE ...Yum. 
Frank's BEEPER goes off. As they look at one another, we: 
CUT TO: 
ABOUT A MILLION COP CARS 
Red lights flashing, have sealed off a Brooklyn Street. On the rooftops SWAT teams are already deploying. 
SHARPSHOOTERS politely insinuate themselves into the surrounding family APARTMENTS and take up firing POSITIONS. 
THE 87 BUS 
Stands alone in the middle of the street. Through a Marksman's SCOPE we SEE the terrified passengers forced to stand, catch glimpses of the TERRORISTS, obscured by the hostages. 
Hub confers with the NYPD officer-in-charge. 
NYPD OFFICER -- definitely Arab-types, only this time they're still in there... 
HUB Any communication at all? 
NYPD OFFICER Nope. It's weird they're just in there. 
HUB Get the frequency of the driver's radio and patch it through to this number. We need two lines. Frank, get a negotiator out here. 
NYPD OFFICER #2 Sir, they've got kids in there. We count six. 
This rocks Hub for a moment but he covers it well. 
HUB That gives us something to work with. 
BACK AT THE CAR 
Elise leans forward as Hub opens the driver's door. 
ELISE What's happening out there... 
Hub takes off his jacket, folds it carefully on the seat. 
ELISE They've taken another bus, haven't they? Talk to me... 
HUB Oh, now you want to talk. You want to be my friend, is that it? 
ELISE Listen, these guys are the real deal. 
HUB How do you know? 
She just looks at him. 
HUB Is there a terrorist cell operating in Brooklyn? 
ELISE (a long moment) Yes. 
HUB Was the blue paint a warning? 
ELISE Yes. And I'm afraid this time they'll blow the bus. 
HUB If they wanted to blow the bus then why haven't they blown the bus --? 
ELISE I... don't know. 
He starts away. 
ELISE Agent Hubbard. Please. Maybe I can help.

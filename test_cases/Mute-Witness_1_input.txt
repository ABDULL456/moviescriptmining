A STREET IN MOSCOW - EXTERIOR NIGHT 
The street is empty at this time of the night, but for the two cars following each other. 
LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT 
LARSEN The girl had it when she went into the studio. Then she was murdered, and it was gone. Where is it ? Think. You were the only person there. 
Close up shot on Billy's face trying to think about the mysterious diskette. She has a short flashback of Arkadi taking the knife to murder the actress. Then another one of the naked actress lying on the bed. Then another one of the blood splattering the wall. Then another one of Arkadi stabbing the girl. 
LARSEN Think. 
Another short flashback of Billy going away from the   set. Then another one of Billy bumping into the hatstand. Then   another one of the girl's purse contents scattered on the floor.   Then another one of the diskette skidding on the floor and hiding   under the large wooden wardrobe. 
Billy grabs Larsen's shoulder. 
LARSEN Write. Write it. 
Billy takes a notepad and starts writing on it. But she is interrupted by a Russian voice coming from somewhere in the car. Larsen opens the glove compartment and takes a walkie-talkie out of it. He talks in Russian in the talkie. 
Billy looks at the pair of handcuffs in the glove compartment. 
Larsen puts the talkie back in the compartment. 
LARSEN Write it. 
They drive along a police station, but Larsen doesn't stop. Billy looks a bit worried all of sudden. 
LARSEN Quick, write. 
Billy shows the police station to Larsen. Then she writes «Police» on the notepad. 
LARSEN Police ? Yes. Yes, but only with the diskette. 
She writes «Why ?» on the notepad. 
LARSEN You know, I work undercover. The Reaper thinks I work for him. Trust me. Trust me. 
She grabs the steering-wheel to force Larsen to park the car. THE CAR FOLLOWING LARSEN'S CAR - INTERIOR NIGHT

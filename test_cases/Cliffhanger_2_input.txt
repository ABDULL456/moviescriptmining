Gabe, still prone, reaches out -- the chunk of ice with Qualen's machine gun is floating by. Gabe snatches up the gun and pulls the trigger. Nothing but an empty CLICK. 
QUALEN Far more intimidating when it's loaded. 
The chunk of ice with Gabe's ice axe floats by Gabe -- Gabe grabs for it, but misses -- as the ice raft spins around, Qualen manages to snatch it up -- Qualen scythes it down at Gabe, slamming the blade into the ice as Gabe rolls away -- 
WIDER VIEW - THE ICE RAFT 
is nearing the center of the whirlpool -- the current is faster and stronger here -- if it doesn't swallow the ice raft, it will definitely upend it -- 
QUALEN AND GABE 
stay on opposite sides of the ice raft for balance -- Qualen swings out at Gabe with the axe. Gabe ducks and tries to go low to hit Qualen with the gun, but Qualen swings the axe down again, whizzing right past Gabe as it sinks into -- 
THE CENTER OF THE ICE RAFT 
-- a crack spiderwebs through the ice around the blade -- 
GABE 
quickly reacts, jumping onto another bed-sized chunk of ice floating by, landing on his stomach and braking himself by digging his crampons in -- just as -- 
QUALEN 
realizing what deep shit he's in, looks for another chunk of ice to make the same move -- to sees one just out of reach. Qualen pulls the ice axe out of the raft's center to drag the other chunk closer in -- -- as he does, the entire raft disintegrates under him -- Qualen plunges into the water, and tries to maintain a slippery grip on what ice is left -- 
-- but now at the center of the whirlpool, Qualen is drawn into the vortex -- 
GABE 
struggles to his feet and looks down, wincing -- 
GABE'S POV - QUALEN GOING DOWN 
Qualen's inaudible scream is just a burst of rising bubbles as he shoots down to the bottom of the lake -- and beyond -- 
QUALEN'S POV - UNDERWATER 
Qualen is shoved with incredible force and speed through the lake's tunnel drain -- 
ON THE MOUNTAIN WALL - THE WATERFALL 
BLASTS OUT full force, hurling a still thrashing Qualen a half a mile to the ground below! 
GABE 
has no time to celebrate -- the chunk of ice he's on leaves him moments from the same fate. One more time around, and it's down the drain. Gabe takes a deep breath. No choice. He leaps -- 
WIDER VIEW - THE ICE - GABE LEAPING 
-- from one chunk of ice to the other, running the way you would across stones in a stream, zig-zagging to catch the ones big enough to support him -- only his crampons keep him from sliding off, only his momentum keeps him from capsizing the ice chunks, which shoots away from him in his wake -- 
GABE 
lands on an ice raft floating towards the bridge. No choice -- Gabe lunges off the ice raft and reaches for one of the bridge supports -- his hand catches -- but it's slippery and he's weakened -- Gabe slides off, but -- 
A HAND 
reaches down and grabs him -- 
HAL 
pulls Gabe the rest of the way onto the bridge. Gabe's surprise gives way to a grin almost as big as Hal's. 
HAL (eyeing Gabe's ruined shirt) Nice outfit. (hands him his parka) I know you never liked the orange, but 
GABE Didn't care for the Smokey The Bear hats, either. That's why I quit. (pulls on parka) You all right? 
HAL I feel better than you look. I can live with that. 
Gabe looks down at the parka -- it's completely full of bullet holes. 
GABE Hardly seems worth zipping, huh? (serious now) Frank? 
Hal sobers -- shakes his head no. A cloud passes over Gabe's face. 
HAL It's not over, Gabe. Travers took the helicopter. 
INSIDE HELICOPTER - FLYING ELSEWHERE OVER MOUNTAIN 
Maggie's hands are cuffed to a bar on the helicopter's roof. Travers keys his headset radio while piloting the copter. 
TRAVERS (into radio) Qualen -- Kristel -- come in -- 
HAL AND GABE ON BRIDGE 
Gabe hears Hal's borrowed headset radio crackling -- he holds his hand out to Hal. 
GABE May I? (dons it, keys it) They can't talk right now, Travers. Kristel's busy making snow angels -- and I'm not sure, but I think Qualen is still falling. (radio silence) Any messages? 
A moment's silence -- then -- 
MAGGIE (O.S.) (over radio) Gabe? 
GABE (keying it) Maggie -- 
INSIDE COPTER - TRAVERS 
yanks the radio off Maggie and puts it back on -- 
TRAVERS (into radio) You wanted to make a trade earlier, Walker -- still interested? 
GABE (O.S.) (pause) I've got the money. Fly to the lake. And if you touch her -- 
Travers cuts off the radio, smiles, and banks the helicopter down around the mountain wall. 
GABE AND HAL ON BRIDGE

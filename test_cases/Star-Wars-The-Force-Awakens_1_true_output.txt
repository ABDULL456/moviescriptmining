REY 
(HEADS OFF) -- No it can't be -- 
FINN FOLLOWS REY TO: 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY 
They plop into the seats, in a panic. She checks the dead 
INSTRUMENTATION PANEL: 
REY Someone's locked onto us -- all controls are overridden. Finn quickly, awkwardly climbs up, looks out. 
REY (CONT'D) Get off. Get off! See anything? 
FINN ... Oh no. 
EXT. SPACE - DAY 
The Millennium Falcon, powerless, is a sitting duck. SOMETHING EPIC appears from ABOVE: THE ANTENNA ARRAY IS THE 
FIRST WE SEE OF A MASSIVE FREIGHTER, ITS GIANT HANGAR OPEN 
LIKE A HUGE MOUTH WHICH SWALLOWS THE FALCON LIKE A WHALE! 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - COCKPIT - DAY 
Finn PLOPS into his seat, horrified. 
FINN It's the First Order. 
REY What do we do-- there must be 
SOMETHING -- Finn's mind races -- then: 
FINN You said poisonous gas -- 
REY -- Yeah, but I fixed that -- 
FINN Can you unfix it? Rey stares at him -- and gets his plan! They head off -- 
INT. MILLENNIUM FALCON - LOUNGE AREA - DAY 
The GAS MASKS hanging in the lounge are GRABBED. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: Finn and Rey, gas masks on, quickly climb into the open grating area. 
REY C'mon BB-8. They help BB-8 down, too: they both struggle like crazy, he weighs a TON. 
FINN I got it. 
REY Oooh... 
FINN I'm okay. BB-8 get off me... 
UNDER THE GRATING Finn pulls the grating over them as Rey works on the controls. 
REY You think this'll work on the Stormtroopers? 
FINN Yeah. Their masks filter out smoke, not toxins. LIGHTS COME ON! SOUND of the SHIP RAMP LOWERING! Finn PULLS THE GRATING CLOSED as he says: 
FINN (CONT'D) Hurry! 
REY I'm hurrying! Suddenly the FALCON DOOR OPENS -- AND HAN SOLO AND CHEWBACCA BOARD THE FALCON, weapons at the ready. PUSH IN ON THEM, ready for combat, operating silently, with hand signals only. 
HAN Chewie, we're home. Han gives Chewie a nod to check out the ship. Chewie heads off one way, Han in another. The grating above LIFTS OFF -- hands in surrender, they look up at Han, who's training his blaster on them, threatening. They're SCARED. 
HAN (CONT'D) Where are the others? Where's the pilot? 
REY ...I'm the pilot... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
HAN You? Chewie MOAN-TALKS. Rey responds to him -- 
REY No, it's true: we're the only ones on board. 
FINN You can understand that thing? 
HAN And "that thing" can understand you too, so watch it. Come on outta there. They climb up -- BB-8 uses his magnetic arm to quickly pull himself out.

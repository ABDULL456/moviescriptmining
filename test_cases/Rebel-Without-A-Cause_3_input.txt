JIM And they think they are protecting my by moving. 
RAY You were getting a good start in the wrong direction back there. Why did you do it? 
JIM Mess that kid up? 
RAY just nods. 
JIM (continuing) He called me chicken. 
RAY And your folks didn't understand? 
JIM They never do. 
RAY So then you moved? 
JIM They think I'll make friends if we move.  Just move and everything'll be roses and sunshine. 
RAY But you don't think that's a solution. 
JIM is silent; he picks at his nails. 
RAY (continuing) Things pretty tough for you at home? 
JIM She eats him alive and he takes it. 
JIM stares at his family through hole in door. 
JIM What a zoo! 
RAY What? 
JIM A zoo.  He always wants to be my pal, you know?  But how can I give him anything when he's--I mean I love him and I don't want to hurt him--but I don't know what to do anymore except maybe die. 
RAY Pretty mixed up? 
JIM If he could-- 
RAY "If he could" what?  You mean your father? 
JIM I mean if he had the guts to knock Mom cold once I bet she'd be happy and I bet she'd stop picking.  They make mush out of him.  Just mush. One thing I know is I never want to be like him. 
RAY (interrupts) Chicken? 
JIM I bet you see right through me, don't you? 
RAY shrugs. 
JIM How can anyone grow up in this circus? 
RAY You got me, Jim--but they do.  Want some water? 
JIM (as RAY gets a cup of water from cooler) Boy--if I had one day when I didn't have to be all confused and ashamed of everything--or I felt I belonged some place. 
RAY (giving him water) Here.  Look, will you do something for me?  If the pot starts boiling again, will you come and see me before you get yourself in a jam? Even if you just want to talk--come in and shoot the breeze.  It's easier sometimes than talking to your folks. 
JIM Okay-- 
RAY Any time--day or night.  You calmed down enough to go back now? 
JIM (smiling) You serious? 
RAY smiles and opens the door. 
RAY's office as JIM comes towards his MOTHER and forces himself to kiss her. 
JIM I'm sorry. 
MOTHER All right, darling. 
She rises and takes his arm.  They start out through the door into the hall, followed by GRANDMA and FATHER. 
GRANDMA (to RAY) This was all very unfortunate, but he made a mistake and he's sorry-- so we're not going to have any more trouble.  He's always been a lovely boy-- 
JIM Lovely!  Grandma--if you tell another lie you're going to turn to stone.

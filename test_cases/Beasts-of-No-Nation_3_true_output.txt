Agu aims at a PLF running across the road. Pulls the trigger. Nothing. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Agu, it is on safety, what was Two- I-C teaching you? 
AGU To always be leaving it off. 
COMMANDANT Off. How will you be firing quickly if it is in safety? Enh? Listen. 
Commandant takes the rifle, looks for a clean shot at PLF fighters. KWAP-KWAP. A man goes down. He looks back at Agu. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) Like that. 
Agu, safety off, fires. It nearly knocks him off balance. He looks at Strika and Commandant for approval, but their attention is on the PLF, who seem to be moving in from all directions now. 
Agu, Strika, Griot, Hope, Chicken Legs and Preacher all yelling at the tops of their lungs as they go forward towards the Rebel positions, increasing in speed, bravado, fearlessness and ferocity. 
As the PLF Rebels near the bridge, a hidden NDF company ambushes them, on their heels, they rush back to the intersection. 
ANGLE FROM the PLF REBELS. See the TWO Companies Commandant sent around the sides spilling out onto the road on either side of town. They too storm the PLF position recklessly. 
The PLF, seeing they are surrounded, drop their weapons and run for the edge of town. 
The NDF advance turns into a sprint. The bravado works, as they drop more retreating rebels. 
Bodies, weapons, and ammunitions scatter the ground. 
Agu looks for Commandant and Strika, his nervous system on fire. 
EXT. EDGE OF BURNT VILLAGE - DAY 
Agu and the SBU patrol the edge of the town and jungle, picking up dropped supplies and loot from dead rebels. 
Commandant stands over the bodies of SEVEN DEAD NDF SOLDIERS, amongst them, RAMBO. Commandant looks like he feels great remorse. Preacher, bandaged but alive, says a prayer. 
ONE LIVE REBEL in underwear, arms tied behind his back, is being prodded by Chicken Legs and begging for his life. Chicken Legs shoots him in the hip. He falls, twitching. Chicken Legs enjoys his catch and takes his time finishing him off. 
Agu notices that some of the RPG's are made of WOOD, as if they were theatrical props, he kicks one. Solid and dense. 
BOOM. Chicken Legs shoots the PLF prisoner again. He turns over, his life slowly draining from him. 
Agu sees ANOTHER BODY laying face down and quickly starts searching his pockets. He takes the bandoliers, smells the water bottle, looks in his pack, brown-brown in a foil envelope, batteries, and a small ball of cloth tied up with string. 
He unravels it. Inside he finds GOLD NUGGETS. He looks at them curiously, unsure what they are, puts one in his mouth, bites it. 
BOOM. Preacher finishes off the naked prisoner. His brains splattered on the pavement. No one seems to take note, by now a common practice. 
EXT./INT. COMMANDANT'S BURNT VILLAGE HQ - NIGHT 
Agu calls Strika and shows him the gold. Strika looks at it warily, as if Agu shouldn't have it. 
AGU What? 
Strika shakes his head and motions to follow him. Agu sighs as he obliges. 
They salute and pass Commandant's body guard and enter an abandoned post office. Strika leaves Agu behind at the doorway of Commandant's room, motioning for him to go in. 
INT. COMMANDANT'S HQ - SAME 
Agu listens as Commandant speaks via radio to SUPREME COMMANDER Dada Goodblood on the other end. It's a close conversation. Strategy. Something mentioned about an intersection of highways. Cut offs to the Capital. And Commandant being promoted, soon, to General. 
His silhouette paces around in the lantern light. Maps are laid out on the floor. He kneels down, studying them. 
Agu coughs, to call attention to himself. 
COMMANDANT (still studying the maps) Sit. 
He points to his cot across the room. Agu enters, careful not to step on any of the maps spread out on the ground. 
Agu places the WAD WITH THE GOLD NUGGETS on Commandant's table, then obediently waits next to the cot, watching Commandant studying the map. 
Commandant stops, notices the wad, curious, opens it, drops its contents in his hands. He looks up at Agu, impressed. 
COMMANDANT (CONT'D) You fought bravely today, Agu. 
AGU Thank you, sah. 
COMMANDANT You see what happens when the men listen to me? 
AGU Yes, sah.

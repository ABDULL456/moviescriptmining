INT. SEANCE ROOM - NIGHT 
The room is a disaster area, full of hysterical women. Oda Mae is being dragged from the closet, unhurt but in a state of shock. 
ODA MAE He tried to kill me! Why? Why? 
No one answers. 
ODA MAE (continuing) Talk to me! 
Her sisters start talking but she shoos them away. 
SAM Oda Mae, we're in trouble... 
ODA MAE We're in trouble? Who's we? You're already dead. 
SAM I can stop them. But I can't do it alone. You've gotta help me. 
ODA MAE Help you? It's me they're tryin' to kill. 
SAM You're right. And they'll be back. I'm your only chance. 
ODA MAE Why don't you go find a haunted house and rattle some chains. 
SAM I need you Oda Mae. I need you to get some fake ID's. 
ODA MAE Fake ID's? What for? 
SAM Help me now, they'll never bother you again. I promise. 
ODA MAE (stopping, thinking) Help you? Whataya talking about exactly? What else do I have to do? 
EXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY 
Oda Mae, dressed to the hilt, is walking with Sam toward the main branch of Market Security Bank & Trust. She seems nervous and upset. 
ODA MAE This is crazy. This ain't gonna work. I don't know nothin' 'bout bankin'. 
SAM I'll teach you. You'll learn fast. 
As they reach the entrance of the bank, they pass a pair of NUNS collecting money to build a shelter for the homeless. One of them holds out a collection box. Oda Mae passes her by, carefully avoiding eye contact. 
INT. MARKET SECURITY BANK & TRUST - DAY 
Oda Mae enters Sam's bank. She seems completely out of place. Sam, walking beside her, directs her every move. 
SAM See where it says "New Accounts"? That's where you're going. 
ODA MAE (paranoid) I'm not givin' 'em any money. 
SAM Just do what I say. 
Oda Mae approaches the New Accounts desk. She seems very uptight. A woman OFFICER behind the desk looks up at her. 
OFFICER Can I help you? 
SAM Tell her you're here to fill out a signature card for a new account. 
ODA MAE I'm here to fill out a signature card for a new account. 
OFFICER And do you know your account number? 
SAM Yes. 926-31043. 
ODA MAE Yes. 926-31043. 
SAM Rita Miller. 
ODA MAE Who? 
OFFICER What? 
SAM Tell her Rita Miller. 
ODA MAE Rita Miller. 
OFFICER (eyeing her oddly) Didn't they have you sign a card when you opened the account? 
SAM Tell her Carl Bruner opened it for you by phone and asked you to come in today. 
ODA MAE Carl Bruner opened it for me. He asked me to come in today. 
OFFICER Ah. 
The Officer checks out the name and account number on her computer screen. It all seems to jive. She pulls out a card from her desk and hands it to Oda Mae. Oda Mae stares at it.

HANNAH (turning, to Holly) Hey, hi! 
HOLLY (overlapping) Well, I just came from an audition... 
LEE (overlapping, leaning against the coatcheck wall) Hi. 
HOLLY (continuing) ...which I did not get. 
HANNAH (reacting) Awwww... 
HOLLY (overlapping, sighing) So what's new? 
She takes off her gloves and scarf, stuffing them in her bag) 
HANNAH (helping Holly with her coat) Boy-- 
HOLLY (interrupting) They said I was too offbeat looking, whatever the hell that means. 
HANNAH Oh, what do they know? 
Holly gives her coat to the coatcheck person. 
HOLLY (to the checker) Thanks. (turning to her sisters) But guess who was there auditioning? 
LEE April? 
The hostess appears, peeking around the corner of the coatcheck area.  She signals for the three sisters to follow her. 
HANNAH (reacting to Holly's news) Oh, gosh. 
HOLLY You got it. 
Holly takes off her sunglasses; her cigarette still dangles from her mouth.  Hannah murmurs her sympathy as the trio follows the hostess into the dining room. 
HOLLY (gesturing) I was very polite.  I maintained my poise. (taking out a match for her cigarette) I said hello. 
The sisters walk to their seats, at a round table in the middle of the room; the hostess puts down their menus. 
LEE Hmm.  I never trusted April, you know.  She has eyes in the back of her head. 
They sit down.  The hostess leaves.  Other diners are seen in the background; a waiter is taking the order of a couple sitting on a banquette; other waiters clear off a table. Diners walk in and out.  A low murmur of conversation, as well as the faint clatter of dishes, is heard.  The camera moves closer to the three sisters, circling the table as Holly speaks. 
HOLLY Yeah, well, she and an architect are now a very definite item, which I still cannot believe. 
LEE (overlapping) Hmm. 
HANNAH Oh, God... 
HOLLY (nodding her head, holding her cigarette) Yeah, although it's put an end to the Stanislavski Catering Company. Which is why I have to speak to you. And... (gesturing to Hannah) you're gonna get impatient, but...I have to borrow some more money. (putting her cigarette in her mouth and picking up the matches) 
HANNAH (shaking her head) Well, that...th-that's fine. 
HOLLY (gesturing, her cigarette in one hand, her matches in the other) But what I decided to do is some writing.  Yeah, I think I've had it with acting.  You know, these meaningless auditions at cattle calls.  And I can't handle another rejection. (emotionally) Now let's face it here.  I gotta, you know, latch on to something in my life.  You know--something with a future.  I'm not sixteen anymore. (lighting her cigarette) It's just...crazy! (puffing her cigarette) I've got...an idea for a story. More than one.  And I just need a few months, you know, or, uh, a year even. 
As the camera slowly circles the table, Hannah is seen listening to Holly, her hand on her mouth. 
HOLLY I've picked up a lot about dramatic structure from doing my scenes in acting class. 
Lee, her hand on her mouth, glances briefly at Hannah.  As Hannah replies to Holly, the camera focuses on Lee's face. 
She bites her nails; she looks down, involved in her own thoughts. 
HANNAH (offscreen) Well, that-that's good.  It just, uh...it just seems to me that-that six months or a year, if-if you spent it more productively... 
HOLLY (offscreen, the camera still focused on Lee) Well-well, like what? 
Lee looks up, her hand still on her mouth, watching Hannah, as the camera slowly moves off her to show Hannah. 
HANNAH Well, I don't know.  We'd uh, uh, um... Didn't Mom mention there was something...something at the Museum of Broadcasting? 
HOLLY (offscreen) Yeah, that's clerical. 
HANNAH No.  She, didn't she say it was, um...she said it was in the publicity department.  That-that can lead to other things. 
The camera is back on Lee.  She looks around tensely, barely listening to the conversation.  She fidgets.  An empty table sits in the background. 
HOLLY (offscreen) Boy, I knew you'd be discouraging. 
HANNAH (offscreen) I'm not!  I'm not!  I'm trying to be helpful.  A person doesn't just say one day, "Okay, now-now I'm finished as an actress.  Now I'm a writer."  I mean-- 
HOLLY (offscreen, interrupting) Yeah, you mean not at my age. 
LEE (shaking her head, unable to take much more) Oh, please!  We all came to have lunch, didn't we? 
HOLLY (reacting, now in view) Yeah, okay, right.  Forget it. (puffing on her cigarette) What's to eat? 
Holly abruptly picks up her menu. 
LEE (trying to alleviate the tension) Boy...Holly...Holly. 
HOLLY (overlapping) I just want a salad. (to Hannah) You really think I'm a loser, don't you? 
HANNAH (offscreen) What do--?  You're being ridiculous. 
LEE (overlapping, reacting) You are, Holly.  Stop it. 
HOLLY (to Hannah) You treat me like a loser. 
HANNAH (offscreen) How? 
HOLLY You never have any faith in my plans.  You always undercut my enthusiasm. 
She puffs intensely on her cigarette as the camera slowly circles to Hannah's face.  She is equally intense, looking at both sisters as she speaks. 
HANNAH Not so!  No.  I think I've been very supportive.  I've...I try to give you honest, constructive advice. 
HOLLY (offscreen) Hmm!

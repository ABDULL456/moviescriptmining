THE DOCTOR we've been very busy. He gestures to TWENTY MERCENARIES or various ethnicities, all standing at attention, not a single muscle moving among them. These are NEO-VIPERS. The baddest of the bad. 
MCCULLEN Is it working? 
THE DOCTOR You tell me. The Doctor beckons a waiting LAB ASSISTANT who rolls out a glass case containing an eighteen foot long KING COBRA. the Doctor bends down and gazes at the snake. 
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) The King Cobra is a magnificent creature. Its venom can kill a full grown elephant with a single bite. He rattles the case and the cobra HISSES at him, revealing its hood. The Doctor steps up to a Neo-Viper and shows McCullen an INCISION SCAR behind the Neo-Vipers' right ears. 
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) We introduced into each subject one thousand cc's of the nano-mite solution. As expected, subjects became extremely ill and fell into a coma-like state for approximately forty hours. The Doctor produces a small HANDHELD DEVICE from his pocket, A FILE PHOTO of a Neo-Viper appears on the device's screen. 
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) When they returned to sentience, brain scans showed complete inactivity in the self-preservation region of the cortex. 
MCCULLEN English, Doctor. The Doctor keys a demand and that particular Neo-Viper steps up and sticks his bare arm into the case through a portal. 
THE DOCTOR They feel no fear. The Neo-Viper grabs the cobra and squeezes, the cobra bites his arm, latching on, sinking its venom into his veins. The Neo-Viper doesn't even wince. 
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Cortical nerve clusters revealed complete inactivity-- 
MCCULLEN --Doctor. 
THE DOCTOR They feel no pain. The Doctor keys another command and the Neo-Viper obediently lets go of the cobra and removes his arm from the case. 
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Frontal lobe concepts of morality are disengaged... No remorse... 
MCCULLEN And they are completely obedient? 
THE DOCTOR Of course. .The real world applications are endless. 
The Neo-Viper's knees give out. McCullen watches curiously. WE SMASH CUT INTO the NEO-VIPER'S BITE WOUND where the WHITE VENOM is racing through a blinding labyrinth of veins. 
THE DOCTOR (V.0.) (CONT'D) The nano-mites will target the venom. STILL IN HIS VEINS we see hundreds of MICROSCOPIC NON-MITES rushing to meet the venom head on. Blocking it. Then swiftly pushing it back. All the way to the original fang holes. The venom seeps out of the holes and drips off the Neo-Viper's arm. He stands and returns to his place in line without a word. The Doctor looks at impressed McCullen. 
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) So you tell me: is it working? 
INT. CORRIDORS - DESTRO HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
The Doctor follows McCullen through various corridors. 
THE DOCTOR The science is staggering isn't it? 
MCCULLEN You've done well. You've thrown the caber clear out of the yard. 
THE DOCTOR But research and science are expensive propositions. If I can make a suggestion..? McCullen stops and looks at him, there is something truly menacing and evil behind this Doctor's mask. 
THE DOCTOR (CONT'D) Selling one batch of warheads on the black market could fund-- 
MCCULLEN --I appreciate your thirst for knowledge, Doctor. But this world is messy enough. Factions fighting and scrabbling for control, for resources, and it's only going to get worse as the century progresses. No. What the world needs is unification. Leadership. 
(MORE) 
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) It needs to be taken out of chaos by someone with complete control. He looks through a portal into a shadowy OPERATING CHAMBER, where a brilliant but vicious looking MAN is being scanned by SMART ROBOTS. This is ZARTAN. A Smart Robot begins to change Zartan's fingerprints, which we see on a monitor. 
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) My family was once this close to that kind of power... 
(LAUGHS) The French... Zartan CRACKS HIS KNUCKLES and gives McCullen a nod. McCullen looks back at the Doctor. 
MCCULLEN (CONT'D) Once I get my hands on the reins, the money will take care of itself. You'll be able to do all the research you want. McCullen strides off. The Doctor stares after him. 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - THE PIT - NIGHT 
Duke, still holding the briefcase, stares at a PHOTO OF ANA from the ambush, now up on a monitor. 
BREAKER We grabbed an image from Heavy- Duty's helmet cam. Ripcord looks stunned, he leans closer to Duke and whispers:

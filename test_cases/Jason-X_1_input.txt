DELONGPREE Yeah, so? I had Cryo 101 last year. 
ADRIENNE Check it out. 
With a smirk, Adrienne wipes the condensation from the small window in the door. Drawn from the inside, in blood, is a final warning - 
A SKULL AND CROSSBONES 
KKINSA So don't open the door. 
ADRIENNE Look beyond it, yesterday's news. 
Yllo pushes his way to the window. 
Shocked faces. 
INSIDE the blue tinted room we see a huge domed Cryo cylinder. It's massive, but our attention is pulled to the corner of the room. Curled up into a ball, is a body - female, young. 
YLLO Is that? 
KAY-EM 14 The room's still operational. She's perfectly preserved. 
Yllo's face lights up, grabs his radio. 
YLLO (into radio) Fat Lou, bring the ship to the following coordinates. Call Grendel, have them power up the labs, we're bringing in the find of the century! 
KICKER Now wait a minute! I don't think you should open that door. 
YLLO This is a science excursion corporal. Just stay out of the way. 
Yllo turns to the kids. He's very excited. 
YLLO Okay, no screwing around. This is the real thing. Do exactly what I say. Okay Thorgan, open it up. 
Thorgan pops the cover from a control panel and hooks up a small gadget. 
KKINSA You're opening the door? What about the . . . ? 
She points to the skull and crossbones. 
DELONGPREE I'm thinking we should call in some experts. 
YLLO This is your find people. You want to give your credit away? 
DELONGPREE I was just saying . . . 
THORGAN The cryo unit leaked. The computers sealed the room. No airborne viruses no hazardous materials. I've shut down the until. Alright, stand back. 
KAY-EM 14 Hold your breath. Initial cryo gasses will render you unconcious. 
DELONGPREE Knock you on your ass pal. 
They don their face masks as  . . . Fshhhhhshshsh. The metallic door cracks open causing a powerful backdraft. The freezing cold air mixes with the air outside the chamber creating a strange gray gas. Ice crystals crack and fall to the floor. 
EXT.  CRYO CELL 
YLLO Kay-Em! 
Kay moves into the room ahead of the others. 
INT.  CRYO CELL 
CLOSE ON KAY-EM'S EYES 
They are not human. Mechanical, digital, but alluring. They dilate, open up. Colored lasers shoot forth, slicing through the gas, scanning the body. 
--which itself is slumped over. An icicle of frozen blood from, the wound in her shoulder, props the body up. 
The other enter the icy chamber. 
DELONGPREE I speak on behalf of the group when I say . . . that's fucked. 
KAY-EM 14 Female, nineteen years old, eight months . . . 34-26-34 . . . bitch is built like a brick shit house. 
YLLO Thorgan?!!! 
THORGAN Sorry. I'll fix her when we get back. 
KAY-EM 14 Time of hibernation 2049. Crystallization at seventeen percent. Suggest extensive Nanotech. Chances of rejuvenation eight-one percent. 
KKINSA What's going on? 
DELONGPREE She's dying. 
JANESSA Bitch looks dead to me. 
The RADIO CRACKLES . . . 
SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.) Yllo, Sergeant Brodski. Get your ass back to the shuttle!! 
YLLO Janessa, stretcher. (into radio) Keep your shirt on, sergeant. We have a medical emergency here not tot mention the discovery of a lifetime. 
SERGEANT BRODSKI(V.O.) Kicker! Get them the hell out of there! 
Janessa removes a Metallic cube from her backpack, clicks a button and a flat stretcher expands and hovers a few feet off the ground. 
Kicker grabs Yllo. 
KICKER We're outta here! 
Yllo pulls away, leans over the frozen girl, grabs the frozen string of blood and -CRACK-breaks it off. 
YLLO Fine, grab that end. 
Kicker sighs and helps Yllo lift the frozen girl and place her curled body on the stretcher. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
As thorgan stands at the massive Cryo-Unit - 
THORGAN Hey check this out! 
Protruding from the door is the tip of a machete. 
THORGAN This caused the leak and there's an occupant.

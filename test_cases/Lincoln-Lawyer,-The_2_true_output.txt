MAGGIE'S VOICE There's a rumor in the office... 
MICK How I'm the one who shot Raul? 
INT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - ON THE PHONE IN THE KITCHEN 
In the BG we SEE HAYLEY, in pajamas, jumping on her bed... Maggie closes the bedroom door so she can speak... 
MAGGIE Haller, is this serious? 
INTERCUT: MICK ON THE PORCH, RAIN/ MAGGIE IN HER KITCHEN 
MICK I'd say so. I'm being set up for his murder. Couple of detectives from Glendale are following me around, just waiting for the go- ahead to hit me with an arrest warrant... Could be any minute... 
MAGGIE How is this possible? 
MICK Bad timing, bad client, me being dumb... 
MAGGIE Is it Roulet? Is that the client? 
MICK I can't talk to you about my clients. How is Hayley? 
MAGGIE Fine. But Haller, if she ever hears anything about this-- 
MICK She won't. Not if I play it right. 
MAGGIE What are you going to do? A long beat. Then he says, just as he told Raul-- 
MICK I'm working on it. I have a plan. 
CUT TO, INT. LINCOLN (MOVING) - HARD RAIN - MORNING 
CLOSE ON MICK, in the back seat. Looking out at the rain. His look a little different: close shave, neat suit. Fade up sound of Earl, meanwhile, rattling on... 
EARL .when Not Guilty Two gets to four thousand miles, that's two cars ready, that's enough to start the airport runs... Scene we saw at the opening. Mick absorbed... Earl notices... 
EARL (CONT'D) You gettin' any of this, Mr. Haller? Mick opens the file (back-seat office extraordinarily neat). Top of the print-out: THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA vs. LOUIS ROULET... 
EXT. VAN NUYS COURTHOUSE, MORNING - RAIN CONTINUING 
Earl holds an umbrella over Mick, they hurry into the building... 
INT. COURTHOUSE - SECURITY VESTIBULE 
The items in his briefcase checked, wand passed over him... 
INT. COURTHOUSE - CORRIDOR - ON MICK'S BACK... 
As he moves down the hall. Everything counts today. Enters: 
INT. COURTROOM - EMPTY, EARLY - CONTINUOUS 
Ted prepares at his table. Look at each other without greeting-- as Mick moves to the CLERK, who shuffles papers... 
MICK Bill, I'm getting coffee. Any for you? 
CLERK BILL No man, I'm off caffeine... 
MICK Hey, is that the custody list? Can I see if any of my no-good clients are on it? Bill lets him have it. Mick, casual, looks over the names... 
INT. COURTHOUSE - COFFEE COUNTER - DAY 
LORNA, she's paying for a take-out coffee, when Mick scoops her up by the arm, urgent, he's been looking for her-- 
MICK Minton's putting on Corliss. He's got him in lock-up already... 
LORNA But Gloria still hasn't let us know if she got to him! 
MICK You said she had mealtimes to work it... 
LORNA Yes but... 
MICK I'll take my chances. Meantime did you serve Kurlen? Moving her OUT OF THE CAFE, DOWN THE HALL-- hushed & fast-- 
LORNA Yes but I didn't like forging the judge's signature...

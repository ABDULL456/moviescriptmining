Constanze echoes him with a touch of malice in her voice. 
CONSTANZE This is just a game, Papa! 
Laughingly, the bystanders take it up, especially the children. 
BYSTANDERS This is just a game, Papa! 
As Leopold glares furiously about him, the actress succeeds in getting Constanze's wig firmly onto his head. Everybody bursts into applause. Delightedly, Constanze puts on Leopold's wig, hat and mask: from the waist up she now looks like a weird parody of Leopold in the smiling grey mask, and he looks like a weird parody of her in the silly feminine wig. Schikaneder starts to play again, and the couples start to dance. Leopold angrily takes off Constanze's wig and leaves the circle; his partner, Constanze, is left alone. Seeing this, Mozart leaves his partner and catches his father entreatingly by the arm. 
MOZART Oh no, Papa, please! Don't spoil the fun. Come on. Here, take mine. 
He takes off his own wig and puts it on Leopold's uncovered head. The effect, if not as ridiculous, is still somewhat bizarre, since Wolfgang favours fairly elaborate wigs. He takes Constanze's wig from his father. As this happens, the music stops again. Mozart gently pushes his father down onto a nearby chair; the others scramble for the other chairs; and he is left as the Odd Man Out. He giggles. Schikaneder calls out to Leopold from the keyboard. 
SCHIKANEDER Herr Mozart, why don't you name your son's penalty? 
Applause. 
MOZART Yes, Papa, name it. Name it. I'll do anything you say! 
LEOPOLD I want you to come back with me to Salzburg, my son. 
SCHIKANEDER What did he say? What did he say? 
MOZART Papa, the rule is you can only give penalties that can be performed in the room. 
LEOPOLD I'm tired of this game. Please play without me. 
MOZART But my penalty. I've got to have a penalty. 
All the bystanders are watching. 
SCHIKANEDER I've got a good one. I've got the perfect one for you. Come over here. 
Mozart runs over to the forte-piano, and Schikaneder surrenders his place at it. 
SCHIKANEDER Now, I want you to play our tune - sitting backwards. 
Applause. 
MOZART Oh, that's really too easy. Any child can do that. 
Amused sounds of disbelief. 
SCHIKANEDER And a fugue in the manner of Sebastian Bach. 
Renewed applause at this wicked extra penalty. Mozart smiles at Schikaneder - it is the sort of challenge he loves. He defiantly puts on Constanze's wig and seats himself with his back to the keyboard. Before the astonished eyes of the company he proceeds to execute this absurdly difficult task. His right hand plays the bass part, his left hand the treble, and with this added difficulty he improvises a brilliant fugue on the subject of the tune to which they have been dancing. 
Attracted by this astonishing feat, the players draw nearer to the instrument. So does Salieri, cautiously, with some of the bystanders. Constanze watches him approach. Only Leopold sits by himself, sulking. 
The fugue ends amidst terrific clapping. The guests call out to Mozart. 
GUESTS Another! Do another! Someone else. 
MOZART Give me a name. Who shall I do? Give me a name. 
GUESTS Gluck! Haydn! Frederic Handel! 
CONSTANZE Salieri! Do Salieri! 
SMASH CUT: Salieri's masked face whips around and looks at her. 
MOZART Now that's hard. That's very hard. For Salieri one has to face the right way around. 
Giggling, he turns around and sits at the keyboard. Then, watched by a highly amused group, he begins a wicked parody. 
He furrows his brow in mock concentration and closes his eyes. Then he begins to play the tune to which they danced, in the most obvious way imaginable, relying heavily on a totally and offensively unimaginative bass of tonic and dominant, endlessly repeated. The music is the very essence of banality. The bystanders rock with laughter. Mozart starts to giggle wildly. Through this excruciating scene, Salieri stares at Constanze, who suddenly turns her head and looks challengingly back at him. 
Mozart's parody reaches its coarse climax with him adding a fart noise instead of notes to end cadences. He builds this up, urged on in his clowning by everyone else, until suddenly he stops and cries out. The laughter cuts off. Mozart stands up, clutching his behind as if he has made a mess in his breeches. The momentary hush of alarm is followed by a howl of laughter. 
CU, Salieri staring in pain. 
INT. OLD SALIERI'S HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT - 1823 
CU, The old man is shaking at the very recollection of his humiliation. 
OLD SALIERI Go on. Mock me. Laugh, laugh! 
CUT BACK TO: 
INT. GROTTO - NIGHT - 1780'S 
A repetition of the shot of Mozart at the forte-piano, wearing Constanze's wig and emitting a shrill giggle. 
CUT TO: 
INT. SALIERI'S APARTMENT - BEDROOM - NIGHT - 1780'S 
Salieri sits at his desk. He holds in his hand the small black party mask and stares in hatred at the place on the wall where the crucifix used to hang. Faintly we see the mark of the cross. 
OLD SALIERI (V.O.) That was not Mozart laughing, Father. That was God. That was God! God laughing at me through that obscene giggle. Go on, Signore. Laugh. Rub my nose in it. Show my mediocrity for all to see. You wait! I will laugh at You! Before I leave this earth, I will laugh at You! Amen! 
INT. MOZART'S WORKROOM - DAY - 1780'S 
It is littered with manuscripts. In the middle stands a billiard table. The beautiful closing ensemble from Act IV of Figaro: Ah, Tutti contenti! Saremo cosi plays in the background. Standing at the billiard table, Mozart is dreamily hearing the music and playing shots on the table. 
From time to time he drifts over to a piece of manuscript paper and jots down notes. He is very much in his own world of composition and the billiard balls are an aid to creation. Presently, however, we hear a knocking at the door. 
CONSTANZE (outside the door) Wolfi! Wolfgang! 
The music breaks off. 
MOZART What is it? 
He opens the door. 
CONSTANZE There's a young girl to see you. 
MOZART What does she want? 
CONSTANZE I don't know.

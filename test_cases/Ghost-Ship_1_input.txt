MURPHY It's a risk I'm willing to take. 
GREER All we got to do is hit some rough weather and you can forget about it. 
MURPHY So we cut her loose and wait it out. A little weather couldn't be anything she hasn't seen before. 
DODGE It's a bloody navigation hazard. One boat can't control a ship that size. 
MURPHY The damn thing's been floating around for God knows how long and it hasn't hit anything yet. So we take it easy. A little of the old push pull. 
A long beat as they hold there. 
MURPHY Listen. Forget this job's just a pay check for a minute. You know I've been good to you. But I'm prepared to offer you something better now. (a beat) If we do this right, it's worth a lot of money. A lot of money. 
They hold there looking on at him, waiting. 
EPPS Go on. 
MURPHY Salvage fees on a vessel like this could come in around four million bucks. At least. Who knows, could be more. Could be a lot more. (a beat) What I'm proposing is... we split it four ways. 
A beat. Dodge looks to Epps and Greer. 
MURPHY Think about it. A million bucks a piece. (a beat) You want to spend the rest of your days drag-assing tank barges on the gulf coast, fine. Otherwise, let's get to work. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY 
The tug is tied up alongside the Chimera, whose dark hull stretches off for seven hundred more feet in the light of day. 
INT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - PILOTHOUSE - DAY 
Murphy brings up the radio mic as Greer and the others look on. 
MURPHY (to radio) United States Coastguard, United States Coastguard, United States Coastguard. This is tugboat Arctic Warrior whiskey alpha sierra bravo four zero niner two. Over. 
After a moment, a distance-warped, coolly professional, female voice comes back. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior, Arctic Warrior. This is United States Coastguard Station North Island. Over. 
MURPHY North Island, I wish to declare myself salvor-in-posession under section four two charlie of the International Maritime Convention. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. What type of vessel? 
MURPHY A passenger liner. Over. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Say again. Over. 
Murphy looks to the others, almost smiling. 
MURPHY A passenger liner, north island. Over. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) What is the vessel name, registry, and present position? Over. 
MURPHY Passenger vessel "Chimera." I will spell: charlie hotel india mary echo romeo alpha. No registry information is available at this time. I have determined to the best of my ability that the vessel has been abandoned on the high seas at position one seven four west, five seven north at... (checking his watch) Two zero one four hours zulu time. Over. 
COASTGUARD DISPATCHER (V.O. RADIO) Affirmative, Arctic Warrior. Please advise your salvage authority pending registry check. Over. 
MURPHY Roger, North Island. Arctic Warrior over and out. 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - STERN WINCH - DAY 
Dodge, Epps, Murphy and Greer are standing on the stern of the boat under the power winch. 
DODGE Okay. We're gonna use a heavier than usual twin cable rig this time, consisting of a pair of number three gauge braided wire tows. (a beat) We'll tie off through the anchor alleys. And come down to the aft port and starboard pins. Here.  Thus, we need to get two of these... (indicating the cable) Up there. 
He indicates the bow of the Chimera. 
DODGE Seeing as though a foot of one of these fuckers weighs about a hundred pounds, it ain't gonna be what you'd call easy. (a beat) Any questions? 
EPPS Supposing one of those cables breaks under tow. 
DODGE Then we'll all be doomed. Any other questions? 
EXT. ARCTIC WARRIOR - DAY 
Murphy has backed the tug up to the bow of the Chimera. Greer operates the deck crane, one of Dodge's mammoth cables dangling from it down to the winch on the stern. 
WITH EPPS 
Epps hangs on to the top of the crane as it comes to the starboard anchor alley in the bow of the Chimera. Dodge pokes his face out from the other side. 
DODGE Ready? 
EPPS Bring it on, dude. 
Dodge disappears from the hole and his hand comes back with a smaller pilot cable, which Epps takes and threads through the loop at the end of the tow cable. She places the end of the pilot cable in a vice collar and uses a wrench to tighten it down, with the effect of joining the two cables. 
EPPS OK. 
Dodge disappears, pulling up the slack from the pilot cable through the anchor alleys. 
DODGE (O.S.) (finally) Hit it!

The dogs waver between obeying Marion and ripping out his throat. 
MARION Don't you growl at me! 
The dogs decide to obey.  Marion lets them sniff his hand, then firmly pats them. 
MARION Now let's see what's in this wagon. 
Rev. Oliver and Abner join him.  Billings eases past the dogs.  Abner opens a large case and finds it filled with bottles. 
ABNER Rum, French Champagne, Madeira, Port... 
BILLINGS No wonder they were guarding it. 
Gabriel opens a trunk and finds it filled with powdered wigs, all perfectly coifed and stored on head-shaped wig- stands.  Rev. Oliver opens one of several identical cases and finds it filled with papers. 
REV. OLIVER My heavens, personal correspondence of... Lord Cornwallis. 
Marion grabs some papers, scans them, then finds matching cases on nearby wagons. 
MARION These four wagons must be his. 
GABRIEL And the dogs, too, I'll wager. 
BILLINGS I say we drink the wine, shoot the dogs, and use the papers for musket wadding. 
MARION His journals, letters, maps, books... 
Abner calls from another wagon. 
ABNER Colonel, we got a wagon full of officer's uniforms and more powder and muskets here. 
Ignoring Abner, Marion, sits down on a stump with a pile of Cornwallis' papers and starts to read. 
EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - NIGHT 
Marion sits at Cornwallis' ornate, folding campaign desk, reading Cornwallis' journal, surrounded by Cornwallis' field gear which includes furniture, music boxes, oil paintings and an elaborate folding commode.  The TWO GREAT DANES sit nearby, eyeing Marion warily. 
The men have divided themselves into two groups, one coarse, the other civilized, each clustered around a separate fire. 
The coarse men, including Dalton, Brother Joseph and RANDOLPH, a grizzled, black-toothed mountain man, drink and laugh loudly, wearing Cornwallis' wigs askew. 
The civilized men, including Rev. Oliver, Gabriel, Scott, Fielding and Abner, talk quietly. 
Marion puts down the journal and walks over to the campfire where the rougher men are gathered.  He stands just inside the firelight and speaks loudly, so that all can hear: 
MARION Today was hard earned but a good start. 
Marion looks at Dalton, then turns to the other men as well. 
MARION In the future wounded British soldiers will be given quarters. 
DALTON Like they gave quarter to my family? My wife and three children were hiding in our root cellar when they came.  The Redcoats locked the door and torched the house. 
MARION You have my sympathy... but the order stands. 
DALTON And who are you to give an order like that?  We all know what you did after Fort Wilderness. 
That hits home but Marion remains calm. 
MARION I'm your commanding officer.  This is militia, not regular army.  I can't hold you here, but as long as you stay, you'll follow my orders. 
Marion looks from face to face.  Most begrudgingly nod. That's enough for Marion. 
As he heads back to his own campfire he's intercepted by Rev. Oliver who speaks to him out of earshot of the other men, except for Gabriel and Billings who overhear. 
REV. OLIVER Thank you. 
MARION For what? 
REV. OLIVER For trying to impose some decency on that sort. 
MARION Don't depend on my decency.  I'm one of that sort. 
Marion walks on.  Rev. Oliver exchanges a look with Gabriel, then heads off.  As Marion joins Gabriel and Billings at his campfire, Billings grips his bottle. 
BILLINGS Am I one of that sort? 
MARION You're the worst of that sort. You're the sort that gives that sort a bad name. 
Billings considers that, then shrugs and takes a long drink.  He hands the bottle to Marion who takes an equally long drink.  Marion picks up his Pennsylvania rifle. 
MARION I'm going to check the watch. 
He disappears into the darkness leaving Gabriel and Billings at the campfire. 
GABRIEL He shouldn't make light.  That Redcoat should not have been killed. 
BILLINGS He's not making light. 
Gabriel shoots Billings a dubious look. 
BILLINGS You don't know him very well, do you? 
GABRIEL He's my father. 
Billings looks closely at Gabriel. 
GABRIEL I know him well enough? 
BILLINGS Don't fault him for having grown up on the frontier.  It was a harder time and a harder place than you know. 
Gabriel looks at Billings, then turns back to the fire. 
EXT.  SNOW'S ISLAND - DAWN 
The men are beginning to stir, gathering around the campfires, cooking, using pots, pans and other gear from the stolen British wagons.

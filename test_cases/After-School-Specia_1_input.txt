MATT A stripper. Her name's Ashley. He pulls out Ashley's picture from his manila folder. Jake checks it out. His eyes go wide and suddenly he's their new best friend. JAKE Who's the guy? A beat. JAKE (CONT'D) Well, maybe I could do it. DEACON No, that's not a good idea. JAKE Why not? FRED It's a lot harder than it looks. JAKE You don't think I can do it? Trust me, I've nailed enough girls. DEACON Forget it. JAKE Look, you little butt munch. I want to do this, and if you don't let me, I'll go and tell your mommy what kind of sick shit you're doing. Jake looks him over. 54   INT. BASEMENT SET AS "YEARBOOK OFFICE" - DAY                    54 DARKNESS. Click. The lights come on. The big day has come at last. The guys are nervously conferring on one side of the room, far away from Ashley, who's standing alone, dressed in a conservative high school girl's outfit. The basement has been transformed into the guys' idea of a movie set, complete with lights, camera, tripod, and sound equipment. A desk and decoration make the room look roughly like the high school yearbook offices. Deacon gives Matt a little shove, and Matt takes a long walk over to Ashley.

MATT So, um, I'll be directing. ASHLEY Okay. MATT Okay. So I want you to play this very understated. It's a very visceral scene, so it's important not to play it too over the top. ASHLEY Uh huh. (beat) Hey, did you guys shave or something? Deacon looks at the other two, all three now beardless. DEACON Okay. I think we're ready here. Fred awkwardly picks up the boom and puts his earphones on. MATT Boom in position. FRED What? Deacon pushes him over to position. MATT Ashley, get into position. Matt gets behind the camera. They whisper conspiratorially. One last reality check before they take the leap. FRED Are we actually going to do this? They look over at Ashley. She's waiting. DEACON I guess so. They return to position. MATT So, um, we're starting with the masturbation and then Phillip, the yearbook editor, is going to surprise you. ASHLEY Okay.

MATT And ... action. ASHLEY (wooden) These yearbook photos of the Debate Club are making me so hot. I can't help myself. THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY, Ashley slowly strips off her clothes. But before we get too good a look, we REVERSE ANGLE FRED smiles ear to ear. DEACON gulps. MATT peers out from behind the camera. ASHLEY (O.S.) I hope no one catches me because I forgot to lock the door. Oh, yeah. Oh, God, yeah. FRED's smile turns into nervous ogling. DEACON crosses his legs and adjusts his shorts. MATT wipes a bead of sweat from his brow. Deacon whispers, DEACON Close up. MATT What? DEACON Close up. MATT Oh yeah. Right. And Matt zooms in. Ashley continues moaning and as Matt gets closer, the camera starts shaking. He can't keep his hands steady. 54A   THROUGH MATT'S VIDEO DISPLAY                                       54A We'd love to get a look, but the camera is shaking so much, it's just a BLUR.

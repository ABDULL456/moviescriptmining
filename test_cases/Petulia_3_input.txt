ARCHIE It's the stuff Barney gave you. 
PETULIA I'm drunk. 
ARCHIE I'll drive you home. 
PETULIA Thank you, I'll take the bus. 
ARCHIE Don't be silly. 
PETULIA Don't pry, Archie. 
ARCHIE How'm I prying? 
PETULIA I'll go home by bus. 
ARCHIE If I were prying, I would ask you how you broke your rib. Right? 
PE TULIA You fall on a tuba and you break your rib. Right. 
ARCHIE Wrong. The rib was broken hours before your fall. L' During this the bus comes to a stop. Petulia rises shakily to board it but she can't go through the entrance with the tuba.

BUS DRIVER Anytime you're ready, Lady. 
ARCHIE I'll keep it for you. 
PETULIA It has to be returned. "Friends of the Evergreen," Archie looks blank. 
PETULIA It's a lodge. In Chinatown. On Grant. Ask for Mr. Howard. The bus driver really leans on his horn to make everything charming. 
ARCHIE (shouting above horn) Petulia, take a cab! 
PETULIA (shouting above horn) 
Don't pry, Archie: She groggily enters the bus, leaving the tuba in Archie's arms. 
25 INT. BUS 
Petulia takes a seat at an open window. The bus is now stopped for a moment more by the traffic light. Petulia, under the best of circumstances doesn't make much sense, and now she's quite groggy. 
PETULIA Will you remember that? "Friends of the Evergreen." 
ARCHIE Petulia, where are you going? 
PETULIA Mr. Howard. Tell him I'm sorry I goofed. Archie, you know something? The tuba makes you look ten years younger, and . you'know ... Thingy 0 The bus starts with a jolt and Petulia winces in pain. 
26 INT. DANNER HOUSE KITCHEN 
Petulia is wincing with pain as she puts groceries on the shelf. David is watching her, concerned. 
DAVID Petulia? 
PETULIA Hi. 
DAVID You okay? 
PETULIA Uh huh. 
DAVID Sure? 
PETULIA Of course.

INT. COUNTRY CHURCH - NIGHT 
The man facing us is bearded, sweating, intense,'joyous. Jacket and tie, jeans, fortyish. His name is Wittold Levi. eXistenZ. Levi turns to a chalkboard on a tripod and writes the word. 
LEVI Written like this. One word. Small e. Capital X, capital Z. He turns back to face an as-yet-unseen audience. 
LEVI eXistenZ. It's new, it's from Antenna Research, and it's here, right now. We now see Levi's audience, about seventy-five people, some standing, some sitting on plastic folding chairs. They are of very mixed age and type, but they all cheer and applaud enthusiastically. We are in the central playing area of a small, deconsecrated country church, and Levi performs on a broad, low, carpeted plywood dais. At the far end of the dais, a man and a woman - assistants to Levi - are carefully laying out about two dozen plastic modules that look somewhat like high-tech ski boots. 
LEVI My name is Wittold Levi, my friends call me Witt - and I'm the project manager for eXistenZ. I recognize some familiar faces - that's all right, that's all right. We won't throw you out. We encourage consumer loyalty, and we want you to help us with our product testing. We're a team, Antenna and you. A delighted stir from the crowd. 
LEVI Those of you who have come to our invited seminars before will know that I normally lead the group through our new games, but 
(MORE) 
LEVI (CONT'D) tonight, it won't be me. No, for the test launch of eXistenZ by Antenna, we have brought you a seminar leader who is rather special. An unbelieving, excited stir. Could it really be? 
LEVI Yes, it is. The world's greatest game designer is here, in person, to lead you, the first test enclave, through her newest creation, eXistenZ by Antenna... The small crowd is now tremendously excited, wide-eyed, murmuring, one or two have actually gotten on their knees. 
LEVI I give you, the Game-Pod Goddess herself - Allegra Geller! Levi moves to the edge of the crowd, works his way into it until he has reached a small, unobtrusive figure who up to now has hardly been noticed. She stands next to a security guard who is dressed in a suit and tie but carries an electronic wand of some sort. His name-tag identifies him as Ted Pikul (rhymes with "Michael", not with "pickle"), and we will see more of him later. As Levi takes her hand and gently leads her out of the crowd, her fans applaud softly, touch her hem. They part like water as she passes amongst them, clutching her own personal game-pod case with both hands. She mounts the dais like a blind person led by her seeing-eye dog. Allegra Geller, early thirties, conservatively dressed, is bright, acutely aware, but wary and controlled. When she speaks, she is deliciously, sexily shy, serious, melodic. 
GELLER The world of games is in a kind of a trance. People are programmed to accept so little, but the possibilities are so great. 
(PAUSE) You probably thought that tonight, we were going to test a new game that I designed. Excited murmurings from the crowd. 
GELLER But there is no new game to test, at least, not in the usual sense. Confused, slightly disappointed mutterings. 
GELLER No, no, it's going to be much better than you expected, because eXistenZ is not just a game. It's an entirely new game system. Antenna Research and I developed it together - the eXistenZ System by Antenna - and it involves a whole lot of new toys, which you are going to be the first to try out. The crowd's spirit rises again. Levi steps forward, smiling, playing off the renewed energy. 
LEVI MetaFlesh. Levi turns to the chalkboard and writes the word. 
LEVI Written like this. One word. Capital M, capital F. MetaFlesh is what our new toys are made of - the MetaFlesh Game-Pod, only from Antenna Research. It connects with any industry standard bioport, which I know you all have or you wouldn't be here... (chuckles from the crowd) .using, however, a very non- standard connecting device which we call... Levi turns again to the chalkboard. 
LEVI .we call an UmbyCord. Spelled like this. Levi writes the word out and then turns back to his by-now- salivating audience. 
LEVI I guess you can tell I started off as a schoolteacher. 
4 (APPRECIATIVE CHUCKLES) But I never had anything quite so fun or so revolutionary to teach as what Allegra and I are going to teach you all tonight. With a theatrical flourish, Levi whirls around to face his two assistants, who have finished laying out their devices on the back table and are now standing crisply at attention at either end of it. 
LEVI Are the MetaFlesh Game-Pods by Antenna Research ready? 
ASSISTANTS 
(TOGETHER) Yes, Mr; Levi.

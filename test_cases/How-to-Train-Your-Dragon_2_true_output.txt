Hiccup steps back from the door, drawing the Monstrous Nightmare out of its cave. It snorts, stepping into the ring, calmed by Hiccup's outstretched hand -- focused on him. ON THE TEENS... bewildered, in awe. Snotlout nervously reaches for a spear laying near his foot. Astrid stops him. 
ASTRID 
(CORRECTING) Uh-uh. Hiccup slows to a stop in front of the teens, with the Nightmare inches from his outstretched hand. He reaches over and grabs Snotlout's trembling hand. 
SNOTLOUT Wait! What are you... 
HICCUP Relax. It's okay... it's okay. 
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 85. Hiccup replaces his outstretched hand with Snotlout's, putting him in control of the massive beast. The Nightmare snorts, but remains calm. Snotlout, by contrast, chuckles nervously -- it's at once terrifying and amazing. The others watch, spellbound. Hiccup turns and walks away. 
SNOTLOUT Where are you going?! Hiccup pulls a bundle of rope from a supply box. 
HICCUP You're going to need something to help you hold on. The teens eye each other apprehensively, and look up to reveal... ALL THE DRAGONS standing in the ring, facing the teens expectantly. 
EXT. DRAGON ISLAND - DAY 
CLOSE ON Tree trunks, being sharpened and planted into the sand at angled rows. Boulders being loaded into catapult baskets. And a war plan being scratched in the sand. STOICK looms over it, looking determined. His generals are at his sides. 
STOICK When we crack this mountain open, all hell is going to break loose. 
GOBBER In my undies. Good thing I brought extras. Stoick TURNS to face the men. 
STOICK No matter how this ends, it ends today. He walks toward the base of the volcano wall, back by several hundred warriors. He raises his arm and drops it. 
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 86. A line of catapults UNLEASH their two-ton loads into the cliff wall. It cracks and flakes away. Several more hits tear away at the hollow shell of hardened lava. A final boulder shatters the fractured wall, creating a deep, dark opening to the cavern within. Silence. Stock raises his hand, makes a gesture. A flaming bushel is launched into the dark, lighting the wall... CHOKED 
WITH DRAGONS. Stoick pulls his hammer and rushes into the cave, brazen. 
STOICK (CONT'D) (War cries and slashing efforts) In a chaotic flurry, the dragons suddenly rush out like bats from a cave. The take to the air, bypassing the axe-swinging Vikings and fleeing the island in a mass exodus. The battle-ready Vikings drop their weapons, confused. 
GOBBER Is that it? Above the island, dragons POUR from every crevice, fleeing to the sky. The sound of screeching dragons fades. 
VIKINGS (Cheering as one) 
SPITELOUT We've done it! Stoick doesn't celebrate. Something is not right. He HEARS something. Stoick turns to peer down the dark throat of the cavern. A deep, rumbling ROAR echoes from the cavern. The ground underfoot TREMBLES. The ships rock. Their sails fill with a blast of air. The cheering stops. Stoick's expression sinks. 
STOICK This isn't over. Form your ranks! Hold together! The men SCRAMBLE to organize themselves. 
STOICK (CONT'D) Get clear! 
"Dragon" DeBlois/Sanders Final Draft (Rev.19) 02-13-2010 87. The ground CRACKS. Stone tears away, cascading like an avalanche. And through the settling debris, the silhouette of a gargantuan dragon emerges -- THE RED DEATH. Stirred and furious. 
GOBBER Beard of Thor...what is that? 
STOICK 
(AGHAST) Odin help us. 
(BEAT) Catapults! The Vikings score direct hits. The burning stones BOUNCE off the dragon's skin. The Red Death focuses on the catapults. It crushes the first one - smashing it and its crew, rattling the beach underfoot. Stoick races toward the second catapult. He LEAPS and pushes a Viking out of the way just before the dragon crushes him under his forepaw. The Vikings scramble in all directions. 
VIKING #3 Get to the ships! 
STOICK No! NO! The Red Death BLASTS the ships like a mile-long flamethrower. The sails are torched. Vikings dive overboard and masts come down. Gobber Joins Stoick. 
GOBBER Heh. Smart, that one. Stoick looks up and down the beach for an answer.

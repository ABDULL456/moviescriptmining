HALLWAY - STAIRCASE - THE LONDON 
We see Treves leave Carr Gomm's office and walk toward us to the stairwell. 
As Treves begins down the stairs, he sees Bytes on the next landing coming up. 
Bytes spots him and goes toward him. 
BYTES I want my man back. 
TREVES Just a moment, how did you get in here? 
BYTES Never mind that, I want my man! 
TREVES He's still very sick. Please come downstairs with me. I'll explain the situation. 
BYTES (shouting) DON'T... Don't muck me about. You've had plenty of time to fix him up, and he's leaving with me, NOW. Do you understand me? Now, Mr. Treves. We had a bargain! 
TREVES You misunderstood. This man suffered a severe fall, if you take my meaning. He's my patient now and I must do what... 
BYTES Pull the other one, why don't you! We made a deal! 
TREVES I know what you've done to him and he's never going back to that. 
BYTES He's a freak! That's how they live. We're partners, him and I, business partners. You're willfully deprivin' me of my livlihood! 
TREVES All you do is profit from another man's misery! 
BYTES You think you're better 'n me? YOU wanted the freak to show all your doctor chums and make a name for yourself, you guv. So I gave him to you. On trust, in the name of science! And now I want him back. 
TREVES You don't own this man! 
BYTES I want him back! 
TREVES So you can beat him? So you can starve him? A dog in the street would fare better with you! 
BYTES I've got my rights, damn you, and I'm going to the authorities! 
CARR (V.O.) Well, go to the authorities... 
Now we see Carr Gomm standing above them, at the top of the stairs. 
CARR By all means do so. In fact, I'll fetch them myself. I'm quite sure they'd be very interested in your story, as well as ours. 
Livid, Bytes looks from Carr Gomm to Treves, at a loss for words. 
TREVES Now I think we really do understand one another. 
BYTES (venomously) Right... Right. 
He backs slowly down to the landing eyeing Treves and Carr Gomm. At the landing he casually turns and disappears down more stairs. Treves turns and gazes at Carr Gomm. 
CARR Singularly unpleasant chap... uh... I don't suppose there would be any harm in my meeting your... patient, Mr. Treves. 
TREVES (gratefully) Thank you very much Sir. Shall we say in a few days then? 
CARR Shall we say two o'clock tomorrow afternoon? 
TREVES (slightly taken aback) Wh... whatever is most convenient for you, sir. 
CARR Two o'clock then... you know Treves... It seems this acquaintance of yours has become rather more than just an acquaintance. 
TREVES ...Yes, Sir. 
They part company. We follow Treves down the stairs. 
TREVES (muttering) Two o'clock? 
Then we follow Carr Gomm to his office door. He stops short. 
CARR (mumbling out loud) Elephant Man? I don't want to meet an Elephant Man. 
HALLWAYS - THE LONDON (NIGHT) 
Again, the hospital is closing down for the night. Lights go off in each hallway. The staff is vacating the hospital. As the last light goes off, we hear the great iron door slam shut. 
TREVES' HOUSE - BEDROOM (NIGHT) 
Anne is at her dressing table, brushing out her hair. She is in a very flattering dressing gown, ready to turn in. We see her reflected in the mirror as well as Treves who is in his robe in the background seated at his side of their bed, deep in thought. Anne looks at Treves and smiles affectionately. 
ANNE (coyly) Freddie? 
Getting no response she renews her efforts. 
ANNE Freddie?... Freddie, don't look so discouraged. 
TREVES I shouldn't be. We made great progress today. I taught him to repeat a few basic phrases. He did rather well, too, but I had to lead him every step of the way. Though frankly, at times I was unsure of who was leading whom. 
ANNE What do you mean? 
TREVES Well, I wasn't sure whether he was parroting me because that's all he was capable of, or whether he sensed that that's all I wanted to hear, and he was trying to please me. 
ANNE But I thought you said that he was rather... simple? 
TREVES He is. I mean, I've always thought he was. I think he must be. Is he simple? Or is that just something I've wished upon him to make things simpler for myself?

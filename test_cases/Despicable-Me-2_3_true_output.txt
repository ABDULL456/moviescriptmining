FLOYD The International-- 
GRU Yeah, I don't care. 
Floyd GRUMBLES in frustration. 
Gru moves to a shelf filled with WIG SAMPLES.     He straddles it. 
LUCY (in headphones) MEE-MO-MEE-MO-MEE-MO!!! Hold on. I'm picking up something! Behind that wall! DESPICABLE ME 2             CINCO & KEN DRAFT    54. 
GRU Ah!    And what do we have here? 
Floyd grabs a sample. 
FLOYD These are my trial wigs. (holds out wig to Gru) You should take one. 
Gru sticks his head into the shelf to investigate. 
GRU No thanks. So what's on the other side of the wall? 
FLOYD Here you are! Look at me!     Focus! 
LUCY (in headphones) Gru? 
FLOYD I promise that this wig will transform you from ugly to irresistible. 
Gru stares at the wig.    Clearly getting caught up in what Floyd's saying. 
Gru is about to respond when suddenly Edith and Agnes burst in, out of breath. 
AGNES MARGO HAS A BOYFRIEND! 
EDITH AND THEY'RE GOING ON A DATE! 
Gru stares at them. 
GRU Date??? Boyfriend??? (yells at Floyd) What??? 
Floyd shrugs. 
INT: SHOPPING MALL - DAY 
Gru, Edith and Agnes race across the mall. Then Agnes points over to the salsa restaurant as Margo and Antonio walk in. DESPICABLE ME 2              CINCO & KEN DRAFT    55. 
AGNES There she goes! 
INT: EDUARDO'S SALSA & SALSA - DAY 
Gru enters to see Margo and Antonio sitting together in the back of the restaurant together. Margo laughs at something Antonio said. 
MARGO Oh, you're so funny... 
EDITH Gross!    Look, they're in love! 
These words hit Gru like a smack in the face. 
GRU Oh, no, no, no! Do not say that they are...no no no, no! 
He storms in.    Edith and Agnes follow. 
ANTONIO (O.S.) ...and my dream is to one day play video games for a living. 
MARGO Wow.    You're so complicated. 
Gru storms over to Margo.     Attempts a smile. 
GRU Margo.    What is going on here? 
MARGO Oh! Gru, se llama Antonio.       Me llamo Margo. 
GRU Me llama-lama-ding-dong, who cares. Let's go. 
SALSA MUSIC begins to play and a curtain opens across the room. WOOSH! Someone leaps out, spinning like a tornado, then lands in the middle of the restaurant with a flourish. It's Eduardo. 
MARGO Whoa! 
Everyone in the restaurant cheers.    Gru frowns.   Not this guy! DESPICABLE ME 2            CINCO & KEN DRAFT      56.

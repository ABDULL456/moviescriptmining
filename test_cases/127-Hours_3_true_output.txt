NO, NO! 
CUT TO: 
INT. CANYON FLOOR. DAY. 
The knife is visible in the crack below and behind his right leg but he can't twist to get anywhere near it. He tries to pull the canyon wall off balance to get closer. No chance. 
ARON Shit! 
He pulls off his right sock and shoe and tries to squeeze his foot into the hole. Too big. Size 10. He looks upward. He can't believe he's done it. 
ARON (CONT'D) Shit!!! 
CUT TO: 
INT. BENEATH CANYON FLOOR. 
We're on a level with the knife in the little hole beneath his feet. An enormous overhead light switches on (Aron's headlamp placed above to let him see). The stick enters from top of screen and nudges the knife in a semi circle. It's a bit Punch and Judy if it wasn't so fucking serious. Huge shadows. No success. The knife remains where it is. Maybe an ant races across it. 
Pause. The stick withdraws. 
PAUSE: 
The stick re-enters with the top of it almost broken off, acting like a hook, we push in on the knife as the stick hooks through the little ring at the end of the knife. It lifts. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARON IN CANYON. DAY. 
Looking down onto the ground, around his leg, his toes holding the stick like a chopstick lift the knife out and up tremulously, breathlessly, towards his good arm. He picks it off the stick gently. Big smile. First one. 
ARON Sweet. 
CUT TO: 
TITLE OVER WIDE INT CANYON. NIGHT: 
" SATURDAY NIGHT ": We pass through the transparent title on our way along the canyon. Half dark. We're on a wind blowing dust through the canyon walls, to find a miner in the distance digging into the rock. It's Aron of course, and his head-lamp is filled with the dust swirling through. He's using the shorter file from the multi tool and has tied a shoe lace to his wrist and looped through the ring at the end of the tool. He pulls his cap down, to keep most of the dust out of his eyes. His lips are caked but he keeps blowing on his arm, to keep it clear. 
CUT TO: 
C/U: DIGITAL NUMERALS. NIGHT. The watch, now luminous, changes to 00.00. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ARON IN CANYON. NIGHT. 
Midnight is celebrated with a tiny, careful, sip of the water. He holds it in his mouth. Puffing his cheeks, circulating the precious fluid around. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. EXTRAORDINARY LANDSCAPE. DAZZLING DAYLIGHT. DAY. 
Daylight, a lunar landscape almost, though with patches of green and giant boulders, Aron whom we sense only by being around his shoulder is out walking with his friend, Mark Von Eeckhout through this field of boulders. They come upon one the size of a house buried nose deep in the field.

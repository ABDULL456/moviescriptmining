But Yolander does. And now we hear the DIAL TONE. 
CHASE Shit! 
Chase flings the carphone down, looking up as... 
An approaching potato truck ZOOMS by. Blinding headlights. A BLARING HORN. Chase barely swerves out of the way. 
Recovering from the scare, Chase reaches over and opens the glove compartment. He pulls out his gun and sets it on the seat next to him. 
EXT.  MICMAC BURIAL GROUND 
Geoff climbs the stone steps, reaching the flattop meas. He stops short, looking over the clearing... 
GUS 
is standing in the center of the burial ground. He's HUMMING, mimicking Renee's feminine tone. Now he stops and slowly turns, regarding Geoff with dead eyes. He's holding a pickaxe and shovel at his side. 
Gus looks to the ground at his side. Geoff follows his gaze... 
A VISION OF RENEE'S GRAVE APPEARS - 
Headstone. Manicured grass. Thriving flowers. As if it had been uprooted from her resting place at Pleasantville and set down right in the middle of the Micmac ground. 
And now, the vision of Renee's grave fades away. In its place is a bundle of white: RENEE'S SHROUDED BODY. 
Gus raises the pickaxe, offering it to Geoff. 
GUS You bury your own, Geoff. 
Geoff slowly nods and approaches, seduced beyond reason.

INT.  GEOFF'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Marjorie stirs on the couch, blinking her eyes open at the SOUND of a THUD upstairs. Otherwise, the house is dark and silent. 
MARJORIE Geoff? 
INT.  HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Marjorie starts up the long, dark flight of stairs to the attic. The thin night-shirt she's wearing does little to protect her from the sudden cold. She clutches herself, shivering. 
MARJORIE Geoff? You okay up there? 
INT.  ATTIC - NIGHT 
Marjorie cautiously pushes open the door. Her concern for Geoff is forgotten as she beholds the Renee Hallow memorabilia. 
She moves about Renee's unpacked belongings in bewildered reverence. 
The gauzy curtains billow about Marjorie like ghosts. And then she glimpses something beyond the curtains... 
A FIGURE 
stands in the shadows, wearing the BEADED PEACH DRESS that Marjorie had admired earlier. For a moment we think it's Renee, but as Marjorie draws closer, we see that the dress has been fitted onto a dressmaker's model. 
Marjorie lays a hand on the fabric, feeling the contours of the design. 
EEXT.  GUS' HOUSE - NIGHT 
Chase's headlights sweep across the front of the dark house. Pulling to a stop, Chase opens the van's door... 
ZOWIE 
LEAPS out of the darkness, sinking his teeth into Chase's shoulder. 
Chase is thrown back over the car seat, grappling with the nightmare dog as it tears into him again and again... 
Chase SCREAMS, reaching back for the gun. He grabs hold of it and swings it around... FIRES... 
Zowie is BLOWN backwards, clear out of the car, spraying CHASE with BLOOD... 
Zowie lands outside on his feet, looking stunned. His chest is a ruined mess. Zowie WHIMPERS and drags himself weakly towards the front porch. 
Chase stumbles out of the van, clutching the gun. He's bleeding profusely.

EXT.  PORCH - NIGHT 
An old saw is laying in a pile of sawdust next to a square hole that's been cut in the base of the front door. 
Chase gives it a look as he tries the door. It's unlocked. Chase enters, bringing with him an illuminating swath from his headlights.

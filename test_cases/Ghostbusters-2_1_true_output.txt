They exit. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  MUSEUM - DAY (LATER) 
The Ghostbusters cross to ECTO-2. 
SPENGLER There's definitely something going on in that studio.  The PKE levels were max-plus and the Giga-meter was showing all red. 
WINSTON I'd put my money on that Vigo character. 
VENKMAN Yeah, that's a safe bet. (to Stantz) You and Spengman see what else you can dig up on Vigo and this little weasel Poha. Those two were made for each other. 
INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (LATER) 
The Ghostbusters are driving back to the firehouse.  Stantz is at the wheel.  His eyes are vacant, he seems distracted and very tense.  Stantz swerves suddenly and HONKS the horn angrily. 
STANTZ (to another driver) Idiot! (honking) Move it, you jerk! 
Venkman and Winston exchange surprised looks. 
EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
Stantz drives extremely fast, HONKING vindictively, weaving dangerously through traffic. 
INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
Winston looks at Ray, concerned. 
WINSTON Going a little fast, aren't we, Ray? 
Stantz turns on him. 
STANTZ (viciously) Are you telling me how to drive? 
WINSTON No, I just thought -- 
STANTZ Well don't think! 
He HONKS again and tromps hard on the accelerator. 
EXT.  STREET - DAY (CONTINUOUS) 
Ecto-2 is now barreling down the avenue.  Pedestrians leap to safety as Stantz runs a red light. 
INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
They hang on to the safety straps as Stantz continues his maniacal ride. 
WINSTON (to Stantz, really worried now) Are you crazy, man?  You're going to kill somebody! 
Stantz looks at him and smile demonically. 
STANTZ No, I'm going to kill everybody! 
He swerves off the road. 
EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
The car heads right for a big tree. 
INT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
At the last possible moment, Winston cold-cocks Stantz, grabs the wheel and steps across to stomp on the brakes. 
EXT.  ECTO-2 - DAY (CONTINUOUS ACTION) 
The car skids into the tree and stops.  The Ghostbusters stumble out dazed and shaken, but unhurt.  Stantz rubs his eyes and looks at the others, completely at a loss. 
STANTZ (himself again) What happened? 
VENKMAN You just picked up three penalty points on your driver's license. 
WINSTON Are you all right? 
STANTZ Yeah, I guess so.  It was the strangest thing.  I knew what I was doing but I couldn't stop.  This really terrible feeling came over me and -- I don't know -- I just felt like driving into that tree and ending it all.  Whew!  Sorry, boys. 
They inspect the damage to the car.

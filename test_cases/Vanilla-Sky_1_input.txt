Sofia dances at the end of a long day. A few others leave for the day, trying not to stare at David. Sofia is there alone. For a moment, we share her solitude. She practices ballet, twisting and turning and landing in frame, looking just past camera. She freezes. She catches sight of David, undisguised. And she begins dancing again. Harder. Does she even recognize him? He moves closer, attempting an easy-going persona. We hear nothing but the sound of his heart pounding, in odd counter-rhythm to her dancing. Finally she stops. 
DAVID You won't believe this... but this is me smiling. She laughs a little at his strange new humor, keeps a brave front. 
SOFIA It's been a long time. I tried to see you but your people wouldn't let me. 
DAVID I didn't want to see me, okay. But then I woke up today and finally, a good hair day. David fights anxiety, smoothes his coat. 
DAVID You want to go out, you want to do something? 
SOFIA (convincing herself) Sure. 
DAVID What? 
SOFIA Let's go out and do something. 
DAVID This weekend. I'll cancel an operation or two. We'll have fun. Because I am all about fun. She kisses his cheek, pulls back quickly, and as she exits... he sees her fighting tears. 
INT. BATHROOM - NIGHT 
David's mirror is restored. He studies himself. Raises his arm higher than he has been able to. In the next room we hear Conan O'Brien welcoming: 
CONAN (O.S.) . please welcome, Benny the Dog. 
INT. BEDROOM - NIGHT 
David watches Conan. The Owner of Benny sits with Benny himself. He wears a t-shirt reading: L.E. Benny is not the most excitable dog in town. In fact, he seems rather spacey. 
CONAN (O.S.) I have so many questions. To start off, tell us all just what has happened to Benny. What's Benny been through? 
OLDER MAN/OWNER Benny fell into the water near our home, and was frozen in the Skykomish River. And I went fishing, thinking he'd gone three months earlier', and there he was in a block of ice, and... David grabs the phone, and dials a number. 
CONAN (off the dog's complacency) He is thawed out, right? Laughter on the t.v. Riding the buzz of what he's watching, David dials. 
DAVID Hey listen, it's David. I'm back in your life. I saw you earlier tonight. I was just watching our old friend Benny the Dog on... on Conan... and I thought of you. (laughs) Whatever. I loved seeing you today. So I'll see you soon. You're a great dancer! He hangs up and feels instantly mortified. He looks at the phone in his hand. 
TO BLACK 
INT. CLUB - NIGHT 
David moves into the thick of a high-energy neighborhood dance club. He wears a facial prosthetic. In the darkness, he doesn't stick out, not much. He spots Sofia and Brian, chatting, waiting for him. The sight of the two together recalls happier times. Sofia is dressed down. Brian, on the other hand, has never looked better. His clothes are nicer. He wears them with confidence. David has practiced an opening joke, clapping his hands together. He will be trying too hard, all night long. They regard him in the mask. 
SOFIA (a little too big) Hi! 
BRIAN (equally big) Hey. 
DAVID What are you drinking? 
SOFIA Nothing. 
BRIAN I am in the mood for cheap sugary overpriced rum-and-cokes. You want one? 
DAVID (spreads arms) Is there any other kind? 
BRIAN I'll go get us some         - 
SOFIA Where's the bathroom? 
BRIAN Behind... over by the place next to the door by the chick... I mean, girl who looks like Bjork. She leaves. David turns to Brian immediately.

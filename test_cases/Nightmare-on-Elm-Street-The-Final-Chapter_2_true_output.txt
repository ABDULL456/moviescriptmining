Blade and Freddy have literally chopped each other to bits, the two mounds of body parts steaming in the cold night air. 
Jacob sees something else and walks over to it.  It's Scott's body.  Jacob kneels down next to the dead teenager. 
JACOB I'm sorry, Scott. 
A CRACKING sound makes Jacob stand up.  Over to the now- silent bar entrance a BLACK FIST punches up through the cement.  With a crumbling of granite, Power Cop rises from the earth. 
Something else moves behind Jacob and he turns, then SCREAMS. Sound Cop's headless body walks into the shot, his arms held ABOVE FRAME over his neck. 
Then Sound Cop's arms lower his dismembered HEAD onto his stump, push it down, twist it til it stays.  With great effort, Sound Cop yanks the brick out of his mouth. 
Jacob now looks OFF SCREEN at something else, something that REALLY makes his eyes widen.  We get to see the shadow of what Jacob sees, projected on the wall of the bar behind him. 
The shadow of the pile of body parts that was Blade Cop begins to MOVE.  The pieces start to REFORM, leg to torso, arm to shoulder, head to neck.  The shadow on the wall rises and we PULL BACK. 
Blade Cop stands across from Jacob, whole again except for a flash of exposed flesh on her abdomen to remind her of the experience. 
Jacob raises his eyebrows as the resurrected Dream Police step around him. 
JACOB (cont'd) Okay, I'm impressed 
Blade whips her visor up to reveal an upset girl's face. 
BLADE COP You shouldn't be. 
Jacob frowns as the four of them walk over to the pile of Freddy remains.  But they're not remains anymore.  All that's left of Freddy is a stack of CLOTH remnants. 
A WIND rises and pieces of cloth blow away into the darkness. The other two Dream Police raise their visors, looking equally distraught.  They all face Jacob. 
BLADE COP (cont'd) This is what we were afraid of. 
SOUND COP He still exists. 
JACOB What!  How? 
POWER COP We're already dead, that's why he couldn't destroy us. 
BLADE COP But he's not dead. He's not alive either. He's something in between. 
SOUND COP He's not entirely part of reality or part of dreams.  He's unique. 
BLADE COP WE can't kill him. 
POWER COP We can wail away on each other until doomsday and not do any good. 
JACOB Then who's going to kill this fucker? 
SOUND COP YOU have to. 
JACOB How the hell am I supposed to do that? 
BLADE COP Krueger's power comes from his rage and the souls of children. 
POWER COP You have to find the original source of that rage and use it against him. 
BLADE COP This town in its present condition encompasses all evils from all times in its history.  The answer is here somewhere... 
Jacob sighs, then gets an idea. 
JACOB I think I know where... 
And he starts to run down the street. 
BLADE COP Jacob, wait.  We have to find him first. 
JACOB No time.  You guys find Karen! 
He disappears down the road as the Dream Police snap down their visors 
EXT. ELM STREET HOUSE 
Karen stands in front of a rotted gate in front of a run down building with shuttered windows and a crumbling foundation. This isn't just an ELM STREET house, it's THE Elm Street house.  And for some reason Karen is drawn to it.  She looks to her let at the bent mailbox. 
It has a name plate on it.  Another one underneath it.  And another.  It's as if people moved in and out and instead of changing the plates on the mailbox, they just whacked a new one over the old.  Karen steps closer to the mailbox. 
The little sign on the top reads WILLIAMS.  She touches it with her finger and it drops off, the nails holding it on rusted away to dust.  A new plate is revealed.  This one says THOMPSON. Karen picks lightly at it, and it swings away.  The name underneath makes Karen gasp. 
It reads KRUEGER. 
And there's still another one under that horrible name. Karen quickly hits the Krueger plate off.  The last sign reads UNDERWOOD.

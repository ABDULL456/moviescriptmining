CHERLINDREA I hope you are comfortable here, inside my kingdom... 
Willow says nothing, still batling the bright light. 
TEEMO Talk!  Say something! 
WILLOW I can't see anything--she's too bright! 
CHERLINDREA I'm sorry... 
The light diminishes, enabling Willow to see the queen. She is a beautiful vision, with flowing hair and lumi- nous eyes.  Her magical presence both stuns and impresses Willow.  She turns to the brownies. 
CHERLINDREA Broke-heart of nightingale for our honored guest. 
All the courtier brownies snap to attention and go into action, bustling about, going to work, some even trip- ping over one another.  They bring Willow a drink in a delicate cup-shaped leaf, and he takes a sip. 
The queen dissolves and reappears near Willow.  She le- ans down and opens the baby's swaddling and looks at the mark on the baby's arm. 
CHERLINDREA It is Elora Danan!  The prophecy has come true. 
The tiny fairies and the brownies stop work and sigh with respect and amazement.  Cherlindrea seems to levi- tate the baby out of Willow's arms, floating her magi- cally onto a special cradle of stram and sticks.  The brownies and fairies crowd around, with great rever- ence. 
WILLOW You mean, you know who this baby belongs to? 
CHERLINDREA She belongs to all of us.  She is the future queen and ruler of all kingdoms on earth. 
Willow starts to get up. 
WILLOW What a relief.  Now I can go home. 
The queen fragments and reappears right in front of Willow. 
CHERLINDREA No, Willow.  Your journey has just begun.  It has been foretold that this child shall bring about the downfall of Queen Bavmorda, whose evil powers have darkened our world.  Upon you depends this princess's life. 
WILLOW Me? 
The Fairy Queen flashes and vanishes.  Willow lowers himself back down again.  She reappears behind him. 
CHERLINDREA You are the guardian, Willow.  You must take her to Tir Asleen. 
WILLOW What is Tir Asleen? 
Willow can't keep track of her.  She keeps changing her shape.  The brownies and fairies snicker at Willow's confusion. 
CHERLINDREA It is a distant castle, where a great king and queen will look after Elora Danan and keep her safe until she is old enough to rule. 
She is gone again.  Willow looks everywhere, frusturated by these riddles and mysteries. 
WILLOW Where is Tir Asleen?  How far is it? 
She reappears again. 
CHERLINDREA The way has been lost in time. But there is one person, a druid sor- ceress, who might guide you there. She was exiled by Queen Bavmorda many years ago.  Her name is Fin Raziel. 
WILLOW You need a warrior for this job. I'm nobody. 
CHERLINDREA You are very important, Willow. 
WILLOW No I'm not.  Have you really looked at me? (jumps to his feet) I'm short!  Even for a Nelwyn! 
From down at his feet, Rool and Teemo stare up, insult- ed. 
WILLOW (continuing) Why can't you do it?  You have mag- ical powers. 
CHERLINDREA My prsence cannot extend beyond this forest.  But I can give you these... 
Cherlindrea drops three small objects in Willow's hand. 
CHERLINDREA They will protect you.  Use them wisely. 
Willow looks at them for quite a while. 
WILLOW They look like acorns. 
CHERLINDREA Anything you hurl them at will turn to stone. 
Willow looks closely at the acorns, then up at the queen. 
WILLOW They're magic?  Are you serious?

{"train": "THE ROCK \nBY \nJonathan Hensleigh \nRevised 10/10/95 \nBEGIN MAIN 'TITLE SEQUENCE: \nAn impressionistic montage: \nA SILHOUETTED MAN in front of mirror dons his Marine dress blues.  Spit polish shoes laced.  Medals clipped to jacket.  All in CLOSE-UP.  We never see him fully. \nThe Man puts HIS HAT squarely on his head.  EYES glint. \nOn the man's dresser: MARINE MEMORABILIA.  Three Purple Hearts, photos of a WOMAN (his wife), PHOTOS OF MARINES in combat locales.  TIGHTER into the photos, we HEAR PANICKED VOICES, EXPLOSIONS, NOISES OF BRUTAL COMBAT. \nIMAGES: Through smoke, a desperate MARINE PRIVATE who knows he will never be rescued... TWO MARINES walk up to a farmhouse door; through the screen we see a MOTHER AND DAUGHTER who know what the news will be... \nIMAGES: A MARINE COLOUR GUARD carries a COFFIN...  Now we are the coffin as a FLAG drapes down on us. placed into a YOUNG WOMAN'S HAND. \nNow we're in ARLINGTON CEMETERY.  Images of the cemetery are reflected in wet puddles, as the SPIT-SHINED SHOES walk past images of the TOMB OF THE UNKNOWN SOLDIER a ROW OF GRAVES comes into focus \nA1G CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S HAT, and his EYES.  Suddenly AN EXPLOSION and we see -- \nA MARINE in a jungle, radioing for help: ,You gotta get us outta here sir, Jesus, they're all over us... ! And an' EXPLOSION ends the communication ... \nAII  CLOSE-UP on the MARINE'S EYES and FADE IN: \nEXT.  ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY - MORNING \nTwo groundskeepers on \"ride 'em\" lawn mowers, BENNIE and MARLIN, smoke Camels and watch the MARINE OFFICER from the opening montage.  He's alone, across the cemetery. \nBENNIE You'll get used to him.  Every Sunday morning - rain, snow, holidays nothin, keeps him Away. \nACROSS THE CEMETERY \nBrig.  Gen.  FRANCIS XAVIER HUMMEL stands before a headstone: BARBARA MCLEAN HUMMEL 1946-1996. \nHUMMEL Hi Barb.  The house sold yesterday.  I know, I know, the market's depressed. Anyway, I'm leaving the area.  Some things I have to do.  Things I couldn't do while you were here.  Maybe you would have approved.  Hell, I know you wouldn't have. (beat) I've tried everything and I can't seem to get their attention.  But now they'll learn how it feels on the other side.  Let's hope it elevates their thinking. \nHummel puts new flowers on the grave.  Walks off. \nEXT.  ACCESS ROAD TO ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - NIGHT \nHeavy rain.  A road next to a heavily guarded bunker facility.  A canvas covered ARMY TRUCK blows a tire in the road.  The DRIVER gets out. Inspects the tire. \nINT.  ARMY TRUCK - NIGHT \nFOUR MARINES in black suits dive through a hole in the truckbed floor into a MANHOLE IN THE ROAD. \nEXT.  ARMY WEAPONS COMPOUND - FRONT GATE - NIGHT \nThree ARMY M.P.s at the front GUARDHOUSE.  GENERAL HUMMEL pulls up in a SUBURBAN.  The M.P.s immediately recognise him and stand more rigidly. \nARMY M. P. General Hummel, sir.  It's an honour. Is the Colonel expecting you, sir? \nHUMMEL Held better be.  This is a security inspection. \nARMY M. P. Yes, sir! \nThe M.P. waves Hummel in, saluting crisply. \nINT.  GRATED STORM DRAIN IN BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT \nThe four marines from the truck are waiting, readying arms.  The leader is looking at his watch.  Gives a hand signal to the others, and up they go -- \nEXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - NIGHT \nThe four marines emerge from the storm drain and move toward covered positions in the compound. \n200 YARDS AWAY - TWO ARMY \"MAGAZINE CHECKERS\" emerge from a building with clipboards, on routine check. \nINT.  BUNKER SECURITY BUILDING - NIGHT \nThe Army M.P.s escort General Hummel inside.  THREE ARMY GUARDS spring up from their SURVEILLANCE MONITORS.  Everyone's nervous, in awe, rigid at attention.  COLONEL CALLAHAN emerges from an adjacent room, sleepy-eyed. \nCOLONEL CALLAHAN General Hummel!  This is a surprise! \nHUMMEL That's the idea, Colonel. \nEXT.  BUNKER COMPOUND - WATCH TOWER - NIGHT \nTwo marines position themselves outside the door to the bunker compound's elevated watch tower. \nAlong one side of the lab is a plexi-glass wall. Inside the plexi-glass is an airlocked GAS CHAMBER. F.B.I chemists LONNER and LING motion to Goodspeed. \nDR. LONNER \nC'mere, Billy. (points inside gas chamber) A dog at J.F.K. got a whiff of something postmarked to a Bosnian refugee camp.  Could be detergent, could be seran gas. \nINSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - is a LARGE WOODEN CRATE next to a TABLE OF POISON DETECTION INSTRUMENTS. \nISHERWOOD Bosnian refugee camp?  I don't get it. \nGOODSPEED Half a million Serbians reside in the U.S., Marvin.  Serbians don't like Bosnians.  Read a newspaper.  It's good for you.  Hold out your hand. \nIsherwood does so.  It's shaky. \nISHERWOOD I'm okay.  Really.  Let's do it- \nHold on Goodspeed's uncertain look, and CUT TO: \nINT.  GAS C ER - DAY - MINUTES LATER The door HISSES open.  Goodspeed and Isherwood, in vulcanized rubber suits and visored helmets, enter. They go to the INSTRUMENT TABLE before the crate. \nA GLASS VESSEL with tiny air holes (like a salt shaker) descends from the ceiling.  Inside are COCKROACHES. . \nGOODSPEED Coal miners use canaries, we use those. Sorry guys. \nDR. LING (into mike) We have airlock, Bill.  Proceed. \nGOODSPEED (into helmet mike) July 1, 0.900 hours, agent william Goodspeed and agent/trainee Marvin Isherwood.  Initiating exam of a wooden crate.  Suspicion of seran gas device inside. \nGoodspeed grabs a pry-bar from the instrument table-and slowly pries open the cratels wooden lid.  He motions to Isherwood.  Together they gingerly lift the lid. \nINSIDE THE CRATE - it's filled with \"UNICEF\" type stuff. Goodspeed lifts out a HOT-PLATE.  Isherwood lifts out an EGG BEATER.  Gocidspeed runs a POISON SENSOR past each. \nGOODSPEED Appears to be kitchen items, cleaning agents, and... (lifts out a sweatshirt) ... old clothes. \nISHERWOOD This is thrilling. \nIsherwood lifts out a DOLL.  Goodspeed's POISON SENSOR'S NEEDLE goes crazy... ! \nGOODSPEED Careful, goddamn it Marvin! \nThe doll's eyes open.  Its mouth blast a PINKISH SPRAY, hitting Goodspeed's forearm and Isherwood's palm. \nOUTSIDE THE GAS CHAMBER - DR.  LING stabs a button marked \"exhaust\" and another marked \"emergency.\" \nA KLAXON sounds.  F.B.I. TECHNICIANS race for the exit. \nIN THE GAS CHAMBER - The pinkish gas hovers in the air. CEILING EXHAUST FANS begin to suck it up. \nIN THE GLASS VESSEL - The cockroaches convulse, flip in the air and explode, guts splattering the vessel walls. \nISHERWOOD What's hap...  what's happening....? \nDR. LING looks at a DIGITAL CLOCK on the control panel. \nDR. LING Don't panic, Bill. 50 seconds and the gas will clear.  You're okay. \nGoodspeed grabs the doll from Isherwood, slams it on the table, and grabs A SCALPEL.  Cuts open the doll's chest. \nGOODSPEED I've got some bad news and some really bad news.  The bad news is the gas is corrosive.  It's eating our suits. \nISHERWOOD looks at his RUBBER GLOVES.  The rubber is beginning to bubble and corrode. \nDR. LING What's the really bad news. \nGOODSPEED peels back the doll's plastic chest, revealing: a C-4 EXPLOSIVE DEVICE and TEN POISON AMPULES. \nGOODSPEED Enough C-4 explosive to blow the chamber and enough poison gas to kill everybody in the building. \nIsherwood's and Goodspeed's rubber gloves are melting. \nISHERWOOD The acid's eating...  it's eating my fucking suit... \nGOODSPEED Chill, Marvin. (yells outside) WHERE'S THE GODDAMN SPRINKLERS? \nDr. Lonner flips on the sprinklers.  The pipes KNOCK.  A FEW PATHETIC DROPS trickle from the SPRINKLER HEADS. \nDR. LONNER Something's blocking the pipes, Bill.  When in Christ's name are they gonna give us a new building ... \nDR. LING Get the atropine, Isherwood. The atropine, Marvin. \nIsherwood, terrified, jerks open an OVERHEAD CABINET, revealing several 6 inch needled SYRINGES. \nDR. LING You die, we all die, Bill.  Inject yourself, then diffuse it. (Goodspeed continues to inspect-the device) Goddamn it, Bill, take the antidote. \nIsherwood fumbles with a huge syringe. \nCARLA Okay.  How 'bout Carla Goodspeed? (GOODSPEED frowns) Six years, Bill.  We've lived together six years. \nGOODSPEED We've talked about this, Carla, we've talked it up, down, inside and out ... \nCARLA Billy, this probably isn't the best time ... Bill, I'm uhhh. \nCARLA I'm pregnant. \nGOODSPEED \nYou're what ... ? \nShe holds Up a positive home pregnancy test and CUT TO: \nEXT.  DESERT AREA (SOUTHWESTERN U.S.) - DAY \nTWO = Y GUNSHIPS roar over camera and land next to the two Humvees.  The Huey's doors open.  Marine Captains FRYE and DARROW, both late 20's, drag out two MARINE LANCE CORPORALS, bound and gagged, and sit them down.  Other marines roll gurneys laden with chem rounds, rockets and other equipment onto the Hueys. \nThey Hueys ascend and SCREAM off across the desert and CUT TO: \nEXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - AFTERNOON \nEstablishing shots of San Francisco and Alcatraz Island in the middle of San Francisco Bay. \nEXT.  ALCATRAZ ISLAND - AFTERNOON \nA PARK RANGER (JOE) leads a group of 80 TOURISTS across the prison exercise yard.  In the background looms the city of San Francisco and Golden Gate Bridge. \nPARK RANGER JOE Alcatraz - \"the Rock\" - is the most famous, and was the most feared, prison ever built.  Here the inmates were allowed one hour of daily exercise. \nFEMALE TOURIST Is it really true no one escaped? \nPARK RANGER JOE True, madam.  From 1936 until the prison's closing in 1963, there were fourteen attempts but no one's believed to have made it to shore - alive at least. \nThe tourists file off toward the MAIN CELL HOUSE.  Bringing up the rear are Gen.  Hummel, Maj.  Baxter, Sgt.  Crisp, Capt.  Hendrix, and Pvts. Scarpetti,.  Royce, Gamble and Starling, all in civilian clothes. \nHummel motions to Crisp, who bleeds off with Scarpetti and Royce. Hummel and the others continue with the group. \nINT.  ALCATRAZ - MAIN CELL HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nCell Blocks B and C, which inmates called \"Broadway.\" A long corridor with three tiers of cells on each side. \nThe Ranger leads the tourist group inside. \nPARK RANGER JOE Al Capone; Machine Gun Kelly; Robert Stroud, the Birdman of Alcatraz; all lived in these cells. \nThe Ranger pulls the CELL DOOR OPEN/SHUT LEVER (recessed in the wall at the end of cell block).  All the cell doors on the first floor slide open. \nPARK RANGER JOE Now Ladies and Gentlemen, the U.S. Park Service cordially invites you to become inmates of Alcatraz - temporarily of course. \nThe tourists laugh and move inside the cells. \nEXT.  ALCATRAZ - WHARF - AFTERNOON The side across from San Francisco. The TOURIST BOAT is docked in front of the U.S. PARK RANGERS' OFFICE. \nSgt.  Crisp and Pvts.  Scarpetti and Royce walk up to the Ranger's office.  They look left and right, then enter. \nINT.  ALCATRAZ - U.S. PARK RANGERS OFFICE - AFTERNOON TWO PARK RANGERS and a SECRETARY look up. \nALCATRAZ PARK RANGER You're not supposed to leave the tour, guys.  Is there a problem? \nSGT.  CRISP Big problem. \nINT.  ALCATRAZ - MAIN CELL BLOCK - AFTERNOON \nThe tourists are in the cells, looking around.  Park Ranger Joe notices Hummel, Baxter, and the other marines standing behind him.  Smiles: \nPARK RANGER JOE Don't want to be locked up, fellahs? \nHUMMEL Not today.  You go ahead. \nPARK RANGER JOE I don't think so hah hah. \nBaxter draws a .45 and places it to Ranger ioe's head. \nHUMMEL I think so. \nStartled, Park Ranger Joe backs into a cell.  Baxter grabs the cell door open/shut lever and yanks it.  The cell doors CLANG shut.  Hummel, Baxter and the others walk off. \nTOURISTS Hey, what are you doing... ? -- wait a minute, what's going on... ? \nEXT.  ALCATRAZ - PARADE GROUND - AFTERNOON \nHummel and Baxter walk up to the PARADE GROUND as THE TWO HUEY GUNSHIPS approach.  They hover above the parade ground.  Cpts.  Frye and Darrow rope-deploy from the Hueys.  They stand at attention, saluting Hummel and Baxter. \nCAPTAIN FRYE General Hummel: Captains Frye and Darrow. \nHUMMEL Well, I cannot.  So, regardless of what happens on this island in the hours ahead, I will stay. The men exchange surprised glances. \nCAPTAIN HENDRIX But General, you'll be prosecuted. \nHUMMEL Yes, Captain.  And I plan on conducting my own defense. it will make the O.J. Simpson trial look like an episode of \"Perry Mason.\" Take your posts, gentlemen.  Semper fi. Hummel's men fall out and exit.  Baxter, the last to exit, salutes Hummel. \nINT.  PENTAGON - SITUATION ROOM - NIGHT \nMany people around a table, each with a DOSSIER on Hummel: \nF.B.I. Director Womack (still in tuxedo), F.B.I. agent Margie Wood, White House Chief of Staff HAYDEN SINCLAIR, National Security Advisor LOUIS LINDSTROM, Chairman of the Joint Chiefs GENERAL ALBERT KRAMER, Air Force General PETERSON, and C.I.A. Director MILTON AMWAY. \nGENERAL KRAMER Last night Hummel and eleven marines, under the guise of a security exercise, walked off with fifteen V.X. rockets.  It wasn't discovered until the shift change this morning. \nON THE SCREEN - A YOUNGER HUMMEL in Vietnam. \nGENERAL KRAMER Here he is in Vietnam - I think a Major at the time. \nMORE SLIDES OF HUMMEL in various international theaters. \nHAYDEN SINCLAIR Four tours in Vietnam, Grenada, Panama, Desert Storm. Three purple hearts... two silver stars and... the Congressional Medal of...  Jesus. (looks up) The man is a hero. \nGENERAL KRAMER A legend.  During Tet he held off a brigade of V.C. single-handedly.  Saved his whole company.  Hence the nickname \"gunfighter.\" \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK What was this book Hummel wrote on Vietnam? Anybody read it? \nRAYDEN SINCLAIR No.  Give me the skinny. \nGENERAL KRAMER The \"skinny,\" Mr. Sinclair, is that the U.S. should have either won the war or gotten the hell out of Vietnam and stopped wasting American lives.  I happen to share General Hummells view. \nThe door opens.  A NAVAL ATTACHE pokes his head in. \nNAVAL ATTACHE General, it's him. The call connects to a phone on the table. \nGENERAL KRAMER Frank, this is Albert Kramer. \nHUMMEL Hello Al.  Howlre Judy and the kids? \nGENERAL KRAMER They're fine.  I'm with General Peterson, F.B.I. Director Womack, Chief of Staff Sinclair, Security Advisor Lindstrom, and C.I.A. Director Amway.  You've got a lot of people worried, Frank. Can you help us out? \nINTERCUT - PENTAGON and ALCATRAZ as necessary. \nHUMMEL I'll come straight to the point, General Kramer: Eighty-three Force Reconnaissance Marines have died under my various commands. Forty-seven in northern Laos and southern China ... \nHAYDEN SINCLAIR Southern China?  We never admitted we sent troops into China. \nThere is a pause. \nHUMMEL Who is that.  Identify yourself. \nEveryone stares at sinclair. \nHAYDEN SINCLAIR White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, General. \nHUMMEL How old are you, white House Chief of Staff Sinclair. \nRAYDEN SINCLAIR I'm thirty-three. \nHUMMEL Well White House Chief of Staff Sinclair, by your ninth birthday I had led over two hundred incursions into China and personally killed that many of the enemy. General, put some duct tape over Mr. sinclair's fat, ignorant mouth.  He has shit for brains and he is wasting my time. \nSinclair's irritation is relieved by the Naval Attache, entering again, who hands him a phone and whispers: \nNAVAL ATTACHE The President calling from Moscow. \nSinclair walks to the far corner of the room with the phone, speaking sotto voice. \nGENERAL KRAMER Continue Frank. \nHUMMEL Eighteen others died in covert, illegal operations in Chile and El Salvador.  Remember the Gulf War.  Those pretty \"smart bomb\" pictures on C.N.N.? My men lased those targets.  Ten were left to rot outside Baghdad when the conflict ended - and let's not even mention Mogadishu, gentlemen.  No benefits were paid to their families; no medals conferred.  These men died for their country and they weren't even given a coddamn military burial. (beat) This situation will not stand: you will transfer 100 million dollars from a Grand Cayman \"Red Sea Trading Company\" account to an account I designate.  From these funds, reparations of one million dollars will be paid to each of the 83 marines, families.  The rest of the money will pay for my outfit's expenses.  Am I clear? \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Except for the Red Sea Trading Company. What is that? \nHUMMEL Identify yourself. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK F.B.I. Director Womack, General. \nHUMMEL You'll be particularly interested: It's a slush fund where the Pentagon keeps proceeds from illegal arms sales. \nGENERAL KRAMER Frank, Jesus, this is classified information. \nWOMACK (stunned) Is this true? \nGeneral Kramer, embarrassed, nods yes. \nHUMMEL If you want the money back, you'll have to tell the attorney General and the boys down at Justice where it came from.  Good luck. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK I am very uncomfortable about this. \nINT.  WOLFBURG PENITENTIARY - CELL BLOCK - NIGHT A long row of cells. CAMERA slowly DOLLIES past cell after cell.  Sullen INMATES stare blankly at us ... \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK (O.S.) I knew, I knew someday, this would come back to bite us. \nCAMERA moves through a door marked \"ISOLATION.\" At the end of a gloomy corridor is a CAST-IRON DOOR. \nBACK TO THE PENTAGON CORRIDOR \nC.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY it won't bite anyone - if handled correctly. When was the last time you saw him? \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK when he escaped from San Quentin. \nC.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY The man was an S.A.S. trained killer. \nBACK TO WOLFBURG - IN THE ISOLATION CELL \nTWO FEDERAL MARSHALS open the cell.'s steel locking bar.  They push open the door.  Dark inside.  A MAN sits on the bed. \nC.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY Can we risk letting.him out? \nA SHAFT OF LIGHT cuts across the cell floor. \nC.I.A. DIRECTORY AMWAY The question is: can we not? \nTHE SHAFT OF LIGHT slices the face of JOHN PAUL MASON.  He is British, at least once was, imprisoned without trial for 33 years on U.S. soil. For now, we have no idea why. \nEXT.  WASHINGTON D.C. - DULLES AIRPORT HANGAR - MIGHT \nRaining.  An F.B.I GULFSTREAM 4 JET sits on the tarmac. \nEXT.  F.B.I. GULFSTREAM - NIGHT \nF.B.I. Director Womack sits with FRANCIS REYNOLDS, 30, an Assistant U.S. Attorney from the Justice Dept. GOODSPEED sits across the aisle. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK I'm told you're our best chemical weapons man, Goodspeed. What's your education? \nGOODSPEED B.A. Columbia.  M.A. and P.H.D., Johns Hopkins, biochemistry and toxicology. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Excellent.  What do you know about V.X. gas? \nPause. GOODSPEED stares at Womack. \nGOODSPEED This isn't a training exercise, is it sir. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK No Goodspeed.  It's not a training exercise. \nHOLD ON GOODSPEED'S reaction, and CUT TO: \nEXT.  SAN FRANCISCO - FEDERAL BUILDING - DAWN \nDawn breaks over San Francisoo.  A BLACK SEDAN and BLACK SUBURBANS pull up to the F.B.I.'s West Coast office.  Goodspeed, Womack and Reynolds get out, go inside. \nINT.  F.B.I. - OBSERVATION ROOM - MORNING \nWe watch MASON being led into an INTERROGATION ROOM, his legs in irons, his hands cuffed behind him. \n'We are watching through a TWO-WAY MIRROR, and WIDEN TO: Womack, Goodspeed, Reynolds and ERNEST SANCHEZ, S.F. Bureau Agent in Charge, are watching Mason.  Sanchez is a gruff guy with the subtlety of a heart attack. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK The following is a state secret.  Disclose it to any party and you will be subject to prosecution.  His name is John Mason.  A British national incarcerated on Alcatraz island in 1962, escaped in 1963. \nAGENT SANCHEZ Director, no one's ever escaped from Alcatraz ... \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK I'm telling you facts, Agent Sanchez.  Do not argue and do not question.  He was recaptured and sent to San Quentin, from which he escaped in February, 1976.  He's been held at Wolfburg since.  He has no identity.  He does not exist.  Understood? (turns to Sanchez) I want one thing: how he escaped Alcatraz - specifically the route he took through the island's tunnels. \nAGENT SANCHEZ You want him conscious or unconscious afterward? \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Don't even entertain it.  This man laughs at strong arm tactics. dodium pentathol doesn't work either. \nGOODSPEED Why's he going to help us now? \nU.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS (hands Womack PARDON) Mason's papers are in order, sir. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Because I'm willing to give him what he wants, GOODSPEED - a full pardon. \nAGENT SANCHEZ Steep price for some information. (waves pardon away) I don't need that to get what you want. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Sanchez - try subtlety. \nAGENT SANCHEZ It's my middle name. (to Goodspeed) Watch kid, maybe you'll learn something. \nSanchez exits. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK (grumbles) I ask for an interrogator and what do I get ... \nMASON  turns away.  As if SANCHEZ no longer exists. Suddenly, over a wall-mounted INTERCOM: \nU.S. ATTORNEY REYNOLDS (V.O.) Uhm, Agent Sanchez, could we have a word with you? \nSANCHEZ Here, call your lawyer and tell him you're going back to jail. \nSANCHEZ tosses a quarter on the desk and exits. \nIN THE OBSERVATION ROOM \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Impressive, Sanchez. \nGOODSPEED You mind if...  uhm....  I take a shot? \nSANCHEZ He'll eat him alive. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK He's already had you for the first course. (hands GOODSPEED the pardon) Go. \nGOODSPEED takes the pardon, goes for the door. \nTHE INTERROGATION ROOM \nGOODSPEED enters.  He's completely out of his element, has no idea what he's doing, and is-suddenly face-to-face with this.... MASON creature. \nThe two men regard each other. \nGOODSPEED Take his cuffs off. \nThe Marshal uncuffs Mason's wrists.  MASON rubs his wrists, staring now at Goodspeed. \nMASON Who the fuck are you, Mother Theresa? \nSo much for Goodspeed's confidence. \nGOODSPEED No actually, I'm Bill Goodspeed. (rallys) Mr. Mason, we really need your help.  That's a pardon and release contract from the Attorney Generals office.  It makes you a free man, provided you cooperate. \nHe slides a ballpoint pen across to Mason.  MASON looks at the pen, then Goodspeed. \nMASON What do you do for the F.B.I., Goodspeed. \nGOODSPEED (lying) I'm a field agent. \nMASON Tell me what you really do. \nIN THE OBSERVATION ROOM \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Don't answer that, GOODSPEED .... \nIN THE INTERROGATION ROOM \nGOODSPEED I'm a chemical biological weapons expert. \nMASON registers this information.... 73 IN THE OBSERVATION ROOM F.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Stupid, stupid, stupid .... \nIN THE INTERROGATION ROOM MASON stares at the pardon contract, thinking. \nMASON You said I'd be a free man.  Define free \nGOODSPEED Uhm, well, emancipated.  Unfettered. \nMASON I know what the fucking word means, idiot.  In this context. \nGOODSPEED I don't understand.... \nMASON During the time I cooperate, will I be outside?  Outside a jail? \nGOODSPEED Well yes I suppose ... \nMASON You suppose? \nGOODSPEED Yes.  You'll be outside. \nIN THE OBSERVATION ROOM \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK Don't give away the farm, Goodspeed. \nIN THE INTERROGATION ROOM \nMASON What's happening on Alcatraz, Goodspeed? \nGOODSPEED A hostage situation.  A matter of life and death. \nMASON thinks.  He picks up the pen. \nMASON (looks at mirror) Then on one condition: a minimum of two hours in the Fairmont Hotel - I trust it still exists.  I want a shower and a new suit of clothes. \nINT.  GOODSPEED'S APARTMENT - DAY \nCARLA stands in the threshold of the apartment, watching the answering machine -- \nGOODSPEED (V.O.) (on the machine) I repeat, don't come to San Francisco. \nCARLA Like hell I'm not... \nShe exits, slamming the door. \nINT.  F.B.I. VAN - BACK COMPARTMENT - CONTINUOUS , GOODSPEED clicks off the phone, thinking, nervous.GOODSPEED notices that MASON is staring at him. \nMASON (sotto) Who's Carla?  And why don't you want her to come to San Francisco? \nGOODSPEED doesn't answer.  He notices the F.B.I. AGENTS staring at Mason and him. He straightens up. \nGOODSPEED You're on a need to know basis and you don't need to know. \nMASON You learn that line in Cub Scouts, Goodspeed? \nThe van STOPS: the rear doors open to the FAIRMONT HOTEL SERVICE ENTRANCE. \nINT.  FAIRMONT HOTEL - PENTHOUSE SUITE - DAY Top floor suite with a private elevator.  Grand, with French doors leading to a balcony. Director Womack, GOODSPEED and F.B.I.Agents Star and Hunt are in the room.  Jackets off, shoulder holsters on. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK I personally picked this suite. (points at elevator) Only one exit. \nIN THE SUITE'S BATHROOM \nSteamy, from the shower.  F.B.I. Agent Cord sits on the sink.  MASON'S VOICE emanates from the shower.  He's singing some ditty off-key.  But MASON isn't washing. \nINSIDE THE SHOWER STALL -- Mason's tampering with the BELL HOUSING of THE RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE on the shower wall. \nMASON pops off the bell-housing. he pulls out the nylon clothesline cord (it's thick, about 10 ft.) and rips it from the bell housing.  Tests its strength. \nSatisfied, he knots A NOOSE on one end of the clothesline cord, then coils. \nIN THE BATHROOM - MASON emerges from the shower wearing a huge hotel bathrobe. \nCord hands him a SUIT OF CLOTHES.  MASON inspects them. \nMARSHAL CORD Put 'em on.  You've got forty-five minutes. \nMASON You going to stand there and watch? \nMARSHAL CORD That's right. \nMASON well if it excites-you ... \nMARSHAL CORD Put the goddamn clothes on. \nIN THE SUITE'S LIVING ROOM Womack is dumping the contents of a BARBER'S BAG on the sideboard. \nHands THE HOTEL BARBER, a swishy guy, a COMB, ELECTRIC TRIMMER and BIB. The BARBER frowns. \nBARBER I can't do a decent job with these. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK That's all you get. \nBARBER I'm an artist, not a barber. \nF.B.I. DIRECTOR WOMACK (holds up scissors) without these he can't stab you in the throat. \nMASON, dressed, emerges from the bathroom.  Motions the barber toward the balcony. \nMASON Shall we do this outside?  In the sunshine? \nThe barber gulps.  Follows MASON onto the balcony. \nON THE SUITE'S BALCONY MASON sits in the sun on a balcony chair.  Bib on. \nBARBER How would you like it sir? \nMASON whatever's in style. \nBARBER oh fabulous.  You look shabby.  Shall I snip and cut the shabbiness away? \nThe barber begins trimming Mason's hair... \nTHE BALCONY - SOME MINUTES LATER Mason's hair and beard are neatly trimmed.  The barber holds a mirror up; MASON examines himself. \nMASON Good.  Thank-you. \nThe barber stands.  Clears his throat.  Rubs his thumb and forefinger together. \nMASON Yes of course.  My secretary will take care of you.- (to Agent Star) See to the good man will you? \nMASON  looks at Humvee's CELLULAR PHONE.  Grabs it.  Studies it. He's never used one before. \nMASON Modern conveniences.  Cheers. (punches numbers) San Francisco. Jade Angelou.  That's A..n..g..e..l .... \nEXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS (HILL #1) - DAY AT THE INTERSECTION - THE TRAFFIC LIGHT is red.  A SPARKLETTS WATER TRUCK proceeds into the intersection. \n103 INT.  MASON'S   CAR - DRIVING - DAY \nMASON runs the red light.  The Sparkletts truck is in the intersection. MASON  violently throws the wheel.  The Humvee swerves to avoid the Sparkletts truck -- \nEXT.  SAN FRANCISCO STREETS (TOP OF HILL #1) ~ DAY -- but doesn't make it.  Mason's Humvee SLAMS into the Sparkletts truck's BACK END, knocking it sideways.

Royce screams.  His knees buckle.  He falls to his knees in the water.  A COTTONMOUTH stuck to his neck...

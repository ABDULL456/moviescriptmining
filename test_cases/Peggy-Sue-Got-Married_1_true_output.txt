MRS. KELCHER What is it? 
Mrs. Kelcher and Nancy follow him outside. Peggy staggers to the front door and leans against the door jamb looking out at the family. 
EXT. DRIVEWAY 
PEGGY'S POV: 
The family admires a new red and white Edsel. 
MR. KELCHER What do you think? 
MRS  KELCHER (disturbed) Oh, Jack. 
NANCY Like wow! Wait till I tell Diane. She's always bragging about her father's Cadillac. 
MR. KELCHER Peggy Sue, what do you think? 
PEGGY Oh, Daddy. You were always doing things like that. (cracking up) That's funny! That's really funny. 
She staggers over to the car and falls against it laughing. Mr. Kelcher crosses to her and catches a whiff of her breath. 
MR. KELCHER Young lady, you're drunk! 
PEGGY (laughing) Just a little. I've had a tough day. 
MR. KELCHER I don't see the humor in this. Go to your room immediately. You're grounded. 
PEGGY (tipsy) Grounded? Ha! The story of my life. I don't wanna go to my room. I wanna import Japanese cars. I wanna go to Liverpool and discover the Beatles. 
MRS. KELCHER Jack, take it easy. She gave blood at school today. Maybe she's just a little lightÂ—headed. 
MR. KELCHER This is not giving blood. This is drunk. 
PEGGY Dad, I never knew you had a sense of humor. 
MR. KELCHER Evelyn, put her to bed. 
INT. PEGGY'S BEDROOM 
Peggy lies in bed, her mother tucking her in. 
MRS. KELCHER My little baby. Don't try to grow up so fast. 
PEGGY Oh Mom, I forgot you were ever so young. 
CLOSE ON PEGGY 
She hears her mother walk down the stairs. 
MRS. KELCHER (O.S.) A new car. We can't afford a new car. 
MR. KELCHER (O.S.) Don't worry, it's just a seasonal slump. 
MRS. KELCHER (O.S.) You have four seasons, you have four slumps. 
INT. PEGGY'S BEDROOM - MORNING 
Peggy emerges from the bathroom wearing a towel. 
VIEW FROM BACK 
At a full length mirror she drops the towel and happily appraises her eighteen year old body. 
PEGGY Let's get physical!... Let's get metaphysical! 
Nancy comes in dressed for school. 
PEGGY Good morning. 
Nancy goes to Peggy's closet. 
NANCY Can I borrow this sweater? 
PEGGY~ Yeah, but take good care of it.	I'm saving it for my daughter.. She loves this stuff. 
INT. KITCHEN - MORNING 
Mr. Kelcher and Nancy sit at the table eating breakfast. Mrs. Kelcher stands at the sink scraping toast. Peggy bounces her hair in her adult, natural look. "GOOD MORNINGS" all around. 
MRS. KELCHER What happened to your hair? You have such a pretty face. Why are you always trying to cover it up? 
PEGGY Oh. I forgot.

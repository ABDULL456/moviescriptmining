[Shang reaches the palace doors just as they close with all the Huns inside] 
Shan-Yu [laughs evily]:  Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha. 
[Shang and his soldiers pick up a big stone statue and use it as a battering ram.  They are unsuccessful at opening the door.  Mulan sees what's going on and arrives at the steps] 
Mulan [to herself]:  They'll never reach the Emperor in time.  [She looks at the columns and runs near to the Shang and his soldiers.  She whistles loudly catching the soldiers' attention]  Hey guys, I've got an idea.  [Mulan runs around the palace to the right towards the columns] 
[Song:  I'll Make a Man Out of You (reprise) plays in the background during the next action sequence] 
(Be a man) We must be swift as the coursing river (Be a man) With all the force of a great typhoon (Be a man) With all the strength of a raging fire Mysterious as the dark side of the moon 
[Yao, Ping and Chien-Po look at one another then drop the statue and follow Mulan.  Shang looks astonished.  Around the corner Yao, Ling and Chien-Po begin to take off their armor and dress as women.  Once the transformation is complete, they take out their sashes and prepare to shimmy up the columns.  Shang arrives and taps Mulan on the shoulder.  He takes off his cape and wraps it around the column to signify that he's coming along.  They shimmy up the poles together] 
[End song] 
[Cut to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 arriving with the Emperor and a high balcony within the palace.  Shan-Yu drops down from the roof] 
Shan-Yu:  Boo.  [Shan-Yu steps into the balcony next to the Emperor] [to Hun Bald Man #1 and #2] Guard the door [they walk off down the stairs that lead to the balcony].  [pacing around the Emperor]  Your walls and armies have fallen, and now it's your turn.  Bow to me. 
[Cut to the entrance to the stairwell that leads to the balcony.  Hun Bald Man #1 and #2 come down the stairs and close the door, joining Hun Archer Man, Hun Strong Man and Hun Long-Hair Man.  Mulan and company are around the corner] 
Mulan [whispering]:  Okay, any questions? 
Yao [whispering]:  Does this dress make me look fat? [Mulan slaps him]  Ow. 
[Mulan, Yao, Ling and Chien-Po walk out smiling, giggling and trying to act lady-like including holding fans and waving fans] 
Hun Archer:  Who's there? 
Hun Bald Man #2 [putting down Hun Bald Man #1's sword]:  Concubines. 
Hun Bald Man #1:  Ugly concubines.

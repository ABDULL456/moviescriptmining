TROOPER #1 Frank Raimi? 
TROOPER #2 You called about a stolen car? The Accountant gestures over his shoulder. 
ACCOUNTANT In there. Trooper #1 moves toward the opened door. The Accountant steps in front of Trooper #2. 
ACCOUNTANT I'm looking for someone. Five- eleven. White hair. Driving a â67 GTO. He's traveling with her. He hands Trooper #2 the framed photo. 
TROOPER #2 Excuse me? The Accountant pulls a shiny, ancient coin, worn from being worried over the years, from his pocket. He tosses it, the coin catching the light, glinting madly. Trooper #2 stares at it. Can't seem to take his eyes off it. Trooper #1's eyes widen as he stares into Frank's room. 
TROOPER #1 Jesus. He pulls his gun. Points it at the Accountant. 
TROOPER #1 Keep your hands where I can see them! 
ACCOUNTANT Troopers, this is your lucky day. Trooper #2 is watching the hypnotic glinting coin. ANGLE - High looking down on the trio as the coin spins right in front of us - we glimpse the ancient face in the worn silver - Roman maybe? 
TROOPER #1 Show us your hands, asshole. (to his partner) What's the matter with you?! Draw your weapon! 
Trooper #2 slowly reaches for his gun until... The Accountant snatches the coin from the sky, thrusts it at the two cops. 
ACCOUNTANT Here. Look at this. They don't see a coin. But a badge. Letters F.B.I. on it. 
TROOPER #1 You're... you're a Fed? 
ACCOUNTANT In pursuit of a white haired man. John Milton. He's travelling with the girl in this picture. Trooper #1 fixes his eyes on the photo of Piper & Frank in his partner's hand. Lowers his weapon. 
TROOPER #1 But, that guy, in the room. He's - 
ACCOUNTANT --Dead. Yes. I'd say it's unfortunate, but I'd be lying. World won't miss him. Look, troopers. I need your help with my pursuit of this fugitive. If we, we three, can apprehend him...you are ambitious, correct. 
TROOPER #2 I guess... 
TROOPER #1 Yes, we are... 
ACCOUNTANT Wasn't actually a question. I can tell you are. Success will mean promotion. Pay raise. I guarantee it. Now we are going to hunt this Milton, we are going to find the GTO he's driving and when we find him, you will shoot to kill. You understand? Shoot. To. Kill. The Accountant's voice is velvet. Hypnotic. Seductive. Purposeful. Promising glory with a hint of damnation. 
TROOPER #1 That's against protocol... 
ACCOUNTANT This man is highly dangerous. He has killed and will kill again. He must be taken down on sight. The time it takes you to follow your protocols is the time it takes him to end your life. The Accountant crosses to the cruiser's back door, the coin disappearing back into his pocket. 
ACCOUNTANT Shall we? 
INT. BULL BY THE BALLS MOTEL - NIGHT 
We're staring into two motel rooms. We're cheating...the wall that divides the rooms...divides the screen. The beds in each room butted up against the dividing wall. On one side we see Piper, on her back. Still clothed. At her feet, on his knees and completely naked, the Busboy. He's painting her toenails. On the other side we see Milton, on his back. Candy riding him like a fucking big-tittied stallion. Candy is a SCREAMER. The Busboy looks up, timidly. Then... 
BUSBOY Uh, are we gonna do it? 
PIPER Well, I don't know, baby. Depends on how well you do those nails. Now pay attention. You might need to redo that one. He hunches over and gets back to work. As Piper ties her hair up with a pink bandanna. Candy's SEX SCREAMS are starting to annoy the fuck out of her. She twists around with frustration and POUNDS the wall. 
PIPER Shut the fuck up in there! Milton twist and POUNDS the wall right back. 
MILTON You shut the fuck up! That's it! Piper swings her legs off of the bed. Busboy wasn't prepared and topples backwards to the floor.

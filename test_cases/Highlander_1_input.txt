For the first time we can see his face.  RICHARD TAUPIN, clad in a well-cut business suit, looks exactly like Conor. 
The police officer, upon seeing the body, grabs instinctively for his pistol.  He yells to his partner now coming into the alley. 
OFFICER #1 Kevin!  Get is a backup. 
TAUPIN I was merely walking by when- 
OFFICER #1 Don't move. 
The officer has his pistol out and leveled. His partner runs up, shotgun in hand. 
OFFICER #2 They're on their way. 
His voice cuts short as the blood flows against his shoe. 
OFFICER #2 
Christ. 
10  INT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              10 
Conor lies moaning on a cot.  Makeshift bandages wrap his body, stained and pasted by thick, dried blood. 
The family surrounds their dying son. 
A PRIEST is delivering the last rites. 
PRIEST ...Libera Domine Animan servi tui sicut libertasi David de manu regis Saul... 
His sobbing mother holds a compress to Conor's forehead. 
PRIEST ...In mamus tuas domine commendo spiritum meum... 
11  EXT. HUTCH - NIGHT                                              11 
A Vassal rides up to the hutch, dismounts, and approaches a CLANSMAN standing in the open doorway. 
VASSAL #1 Has the boy died? 
CLANSMAN He is having the last rites now.  It should be over by morning. 
VASSAL #1 Never seen anybody cut as bad live so long.  He should have died on the field. 
CLANSMAN Tonight or tomorrow, it's all the same. 
The Vassal peers inside at the priest administering the sacraments. 
PRIEST ...Auditorium nostrum in nomine domini... 
VASSAL #1 This has been a dark day. 
PRIEST ...Requiescant in pace... 
12  EXT. ALLEY - NIGHT                                              12 
There is a bustle of activity.  Setting up barricades, uni- formed OFFICERS are trying to keep NEW CREWS and curious ONLOOKERS at a distance. 
DETECTIVE LT. MORAN 
Lean, fortyish, and comfortable with the gore in front of him, is inspecting the corpse with a MEDICAL EXAMINER. 
EXAMINER (studying body) Real clean.  No sawing action at all.  Whatever it was did it in one swipe. (looks up at Moran) Like the other one. 
Moran gestures to a sword, wrapped in plastic, lying nearby. 
MORAN What about that? 
EXAMINER Hasn't any blood on it. 
MORAN (looking around) About the only thing that doesn't. 
EXAMINER I'll give it a closer look when I get back. 
BRENNA CARTWRIGHT 
Pretty but not beautiful, thirtyish, she exudes a sort of insolent intelligence. 
An OFFICER sees her duck under a police barricade. 
OFFICER #3 Come on Brenna, you know better than that. 
BRENNA I'm invited. 
She walks to where the medical examiner is organizing his equipment. 
BRENNA (greeting) Mr. Levine...

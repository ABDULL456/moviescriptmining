The CHINESE PROFESSOR moves away. 
ANDREW Good point. 
Andrew removes a legal pad with "KENTON" written in big letters across the top, and lots of notes underneath. 
ANDREW (CONT.) The partner who spotted the lesion, Walter Kenton, used to work for Benton, Myers, in D.C. There's a paralegal there, Maria Torres. She's had lesions on and off for three years. She says it was common knowledge around the office that her lesions were caused by AIDS. 
JOE They didn't fire her? 
ANDREW No. They didn't fire her. 
Andrew goes back to his work. Joe stands there. 
JOE So Kenton connected the... lesion, and whatever suspicions he had about your personal life... to this woman, Maria... and blew the whistle on you. Suddenly you're losing files, and it's time to let you go. But, up to this point, you've been their Golden Boy, their rising star... Their behavior is... inconsistent. 
ANDREW Thank you. 
Andrew goes back to work. 
JOE There is no relevant precedent. 
ANDREW (not looking up) Arline decision. Supreme Court. 
JOE Arline? 
Andrew SHOVES the legal book toward Joe. 
CLOSE ON ANDREW'S HANDS (with one blotch) on the book's white pages. 
The book is still facing Andrew. If Joe wants to read it, he'll have to turn it around. 
Joe looks at Andrew's hands. A MOMENT. 
Joe turns the book around, begins to read: 
JOE "The Federal Vocational Rehabilitation Act of 1973 prohibits discrimination..." 
CAMERA CRANES UP, TOWARD THE CEILING... JOE CONTINUES READING IN VOICE-OVER: 
JOE (VO) (CONT.) "... against otherwise qualified handicapped persons who are able to perform the duties required by their employment..." 
CAMERA GOES HIGHER, LOOKING DOWN ON THE ROWS OF BOOKS AND THE LONG TABLES DOTTED WITH PEOPLE... 
JOE (VO) (CONT.) "Although the ruling did not address the specific issue of HIV and AIDS discrimination..." 
DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER: Andrew and Joe face each other at their table, but NO ONE ELSE remains at that table, or at the table next to it... 
ANDREW (VO) "Subsequent decisions have held that AIDS is protected as a handicap under law, not only because of the physical limitations it imposes..." 
DISSOLVE TO A SAME ANGLE AN HOUR LATER (DAY IS TURNING INTO NIGHT): Joe pacing, Andrew reading. Their section of the library is COMPLETELY EMPTY but for Andrew and Joe. 
ANDREW (VO) (CONT.) "But because the prejudice surrounding AIDS exacts a social death which precedes the actual, physical one..." 
DISSOLVE TO SAME ANGLE, LATER: Andrew and Joe sit on the same side of the table, reading the same book. 
JOE (VO) "This is the essence of discrimination: formulating opinions about others not based on their individual merits but, rather, on their membership in a group with assumed characteristics... 
The library is QUIET. Andrew SNEEZES. 
Joe scoots his chair away from Andrew by eight inches. 
DISCO MUSIC RISES ACCOMPANIED BY THE SOUNDS OF GRUNTING, HEAVY BREATHING AND SLAPPING FLESH AS WE... 
CUT TO: 
MUSCULAR, SWEATY MALE BODIES SLAMMING INTO EACH OTHER, sounds of GRUNTS, skin SLAPPING against skin (INT./NIGHT) ... 
... Hand SLAPPING a butt under satin shorts 
... Sweaty armpits... the ROAR OF A CROWD...

WIDE ANGLE REVEALS: A basketball game in progress, Sixers versus the Celtics in Philly's Spectrum Arena. 
ON CLOSED CIRCUIT TV: ROBERT PARISH going for a lay-up... 
WHEELER/KENTON/OTHERS Watch this guy! Nail him! Ouch! 
Charles Wheeler, Walter Kenton, Kenneth Killcoyne, Bob Seidman and SEVERAL LAWYERS and SPOUSES watch the game from a plush, private box, complete with TV, bar, snack table. The lawyers wear Ralph Lauren polos, chinos and ball caps. The place reeks of cigar smoke. Walter Kenton has a twentyfive year old WIFE. 
Charles Wheeler's nine year old GRANDSON sits nearby. Wheeler turns the GRANDSON'S ballcap around, smiling lovingly at the boy. 
JUST BEYOND WHEELER: The door to the box is opened by a SECURITY GUARD and a well-dressed, charismatic MAN looks in. 
WHEELER (spotting him) Julius! 
KENTON Dr. J.!

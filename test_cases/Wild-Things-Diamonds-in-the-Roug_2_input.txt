The Curator paces back and forth, like an expectant father, in front of the empty glass case that used to house the diamonds. Marie bursts into the Museum, and he strides up to meet her, shocked when he sees Marie's covered in blood, sweat and guilt... 
CURATOR Marie? Are you alright? 
MARIE Never better. Got the money? 
The Curator nods nervously. 
CURATOR I convinced the board of the extraordinary circumstances surrounding... 
MARIE Good. S he fishes in her bag for the diamonds... 
CURATOR I...I received a call from your 'associate'. He said he would be handling the transaction. 
MARIE Change of plans. My 'associate' got tied up at work. Completely swamped... 
The Curator nods, unsure if he inquire further... 
Marie finally pulls out two blood soaked Diamonds from her bag, thrusts them at the Curator. He screws up his wrinkled face, afraid to touch them... 
MARIE Calm down. It's just blood. 
EXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON 
With trembling hands, Elena opens the trunk of Chad's crashed car. She pulls out a plastic gas container, sloshing the fuel around inside, then trailing it back across the vine covered ground... 
She carefully places the empty container down, standing twenty feet back from the wreckage, fumbling in her pocket for a match... 
She can barely control her hands, her whole body shaking in fear... 
Finally she pulls out a MATCHBOOK, still sopping wet from the swamp. She strikes match after match, but they won't light, until, finally, one produces a tiny flame that simmers for a second then smoulders out... 
ELENA Don't do this to me, please... 
In frustration, she runs back to Chad's car, looking desperately for a lighter, climbing all the way in. Because of the slight slope it's on, the car's flimsy door slams shut behind her. 
Elena pays no heed, continues to rummage through the glove compartment. 
ELENA You gotta have a lighter or some... 
She's cut off as the WRECKED CAR'S HORN BLARES OUT! 
Deafening, the sound echoes around the dense undergrowth. Elena's heart skips a beat. Chad's corpse has slumped forward against the steering wheel. 
ELENA Jesus... 
She struggles with all her might to pull Chad's body back off the horn... S ilence reigns once more. Elena takes short, sharp breaths. Looks over at Chad's body slumped to the side, leaning against the driver's side door... 
ELENA I'm sorry. I'm so sorry... 
Not as sorry as she's going to be... 
The match she discarded outside only seconds ago continues to smoulder for a second, then REIGNITES! 
INT. MUSEUM - AFTERNOON 
The Curator carefully examines the diamond, turning it over and over in his hands. Marie stands over him, impatiently tapping her muddy shoe on the marble floor... 
MARIE So? 
CURATOR I...I'm not sure... 
MARIE Can you get the cash or not? 
The Curator looks up to her, bemused. 
CURATOR I can get the cash...it's just... 
Marie smiles a wicked grin. 
MARIE Then let's have those dead presidents... 
EXT. CHAD'S CAR - AFTERNOON 
The discarded match has set fire to the surrounding vines on the ground, and slowly the fire edges it way towards the line of gasoline that Elena trailed from Chad's wrecked car... 
INSIDE THE CAR

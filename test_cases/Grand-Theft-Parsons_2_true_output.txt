CON TINUE D: 
LARRY What's the matter? 
PHIL Nothing. 
LARRY Well... What flight are they on? 
PHIL We'll wait here. 
LARRY Okay. Well, what time is the flight due? PHIL Soon. 
LARRY Okay.   How soon? 
PHIL Why do you ask so many damn questions? 
LARRY Well... I don't know. 
There is silence.         Then: 
LARRY (CONT'D) Shouldn't we be at arrivals? 
PHIL Look, will you please shut up asking me stuff? 
LARRY Okay. 
He looks out of the window, and then back at Phil, who now has his eyes closed. 
LARRY (CONT'D) So how long are we going to wait? 
Phil doesn't answer for a moment.      Just as Larry opens his mouth to ask again, Phil speaks. 
PHIL Morning. 
Larry looks at Phil with astonishment. 
CON TINUE D: (2) 
LARRY Morning?   What do you mean, morning? 
PHIL We'll make the pick-up in the morning. 
Larry tries to start the car. Phil leans over and plucks the screwdriver from his hand. He reclines his seat and closes his eyes. 
LARRY You wait till morning.   I'm going home. Larry opens the door and gets out of the car. He slams the door shut behind him and stomps off into the gloom. Phil doesn't move. 
INT. HEARSE - OUTSIDE MORTUARY. EVENING - MOMENTS LATER 
The drivers' door opens and Larry gets back into the car. 
LARRY I'm only back because I don't trust you with Bernice. I don't even know you, and if you think I'm going to leave my car with you and just walk away, then you've got another thought on the way. 
He stares at Phil, who hasn't moved an inch: eyes still closed, unlit cigar hanging out of the corner of his mouth, feet up on the dash. 
LARRY (CONT'D) I'm staying right here. Where I can keep an eye on things... 
There is still no response from Phil. After a moment, Larry settles back in his seat and closes his eyes. 
EXT. OUTSIDE MORTUARY. NIGHT 
The hearse disappears into the gloom as the light fades and night falls. 
EXT. OUTSIDE BARBARA'S HOME. MORNING 
A door swings open, and Barbara appears. She is looking quite stunning, with a tight black suit doing equal justice to her womanly curves and her duties as a mourner. She strides down the sidewalk, and as a group of schoolchildren appears around the corner Barbara scatters left and right. 
CON TINUE D: Then she cuts across the road, and a delivery van skids to a halt inches away, horn blaring. The driver leans out of the window, furious. 
DRIVER Hey, lady! 
Barbara stops and whips round, her hair cascading across her shoulders, her blue eyes flashing. The man simply stares at her, enchanted by her beauty. 
BARBARA Yes? 
He continues to stare, and is only shaken back to his senses by a burst of abuse from further back in the road. DRIVER You... should be careful. 
Barbara smiles.

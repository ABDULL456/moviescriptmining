VOICE OF TODD We're shutting you down, Dorf. 
INT. PRODUCTION OFFICE -- DAY 
Damien sits behind his desk, looking scared. Vietnam photos, maps, and sketches cover the walls. Standing in the office are ASSORTED CREW, including Cody and Four Leaf, who whittles a stick with his hooks, never looking up. 
Tropic Thunder 22. They are all staring at a speaker phone. 
DAMIEN You can't do that Todd. 
VOICE OF TODD I Yes we can.. The dailies are not good. 
DAMIEN Dailies are always bad! Bad dailies, good movie! Isn't that what they say? 
VOICE OF TODD I never heard that saying. Look, Damien. Fact: You're. three weeks behind and you've been shooting for five days. Fact: we greenlit this project at a very specific number, a number Walter and I could get in bed. with, and fact--. 
DAMIEN ,. _. (starting to lose it) Todd, it really isn't necessary for you to,keep saying "fact" before everything. It's kind of implied, that if you are saying.it-- 
VOICE OF TODD Alright.. I'm just.trying to keep the emotion out of it, so I thought I would say."fact" before each fact, so it would be less-upsetting -- I 
VOICE OF WALTER Ok, Damien, this is Walter, I'm just gonna jump in.and bad-cop.it here for a second. Dude, I mean, 46,000 dollars for Chris Michael Speedman's masseuse's miscellaneous living expenses? It sounds like the inmates are running the asylum. 
DAMIEN Well, yes, that's exactly-it,.Walter if- you actually came out here you would see that .these actors are-- 
VOICE OF TODD (loud out of'nowhere) The actors didn't blow up the rainforest and forget to turn on the camera Damien! I have a lot of tolerance, but when. Lt comes to nature I lose it!

IN âº VOICE OF TODD (cont'd) I will not be called an eco-terrorist, do you understand that? Damien looks a bit bewildered by that. His hot young assistant comes in with a cell phone. 
HOT YOUNG ASSISTANT Sorry. (whispering to Damien) It's Chris Michael, he says it's important. Damien, shaking now, steps out on to the balcony and slides the glass door shut. 
EXT. RUNDOWN BALCONY -- DAY 
Though the hotel is a shambles, the view out on to the bay is spectacular. 
DAMIEN (trying to seem calm) Yes, Chris!? 
EXT. SPEEDMAN'S PALATIAL BEACHFRONT ESTATE 
In stark contrast to the hotel where everyone else is living, Speedman is in what looks like an Asian presidential palace overlooking the ocean. SPEEDMAN is standing on the deck, trying hard to hold the, phone with his hook hands. "Simple Jack" plays on a flat screen inside. 
SPEEDMAN Hey, Dorf. Just wanted to call and throw a little pep talk your way. I know today was rough, and you're probably mad at yourself for not getting the shots, but that's the way these movies go. We all boot it from time to time, and today was just one of those days. Happens. 
DAMIEN (sickly sweet) Yes it does. It does. Though I do think you have to realize Chris, that you are somewhat responsi-- 
Tropic Thunder 24. 
SPEEDMAN Oh, also needed to let you know, and I. .know you're like wrapped up with the movie, but I really need that new chef like we talked about, you know to really 4 get that super-ripped thing happening. This guy is great but all he makes are dumplings. And they stiill haven't worked out the TiVo thing. III I. I I 4I 
DAMIEN' Right. well those things... those. 4, 
things ...I'm dealing with bigger issues right now Chris -- 
SPEEDMAN Yeah, of course, I just know we talked about getting super-super-ripped for that starvation sequence Speedman's other line goes. He sees the caller I.D. 
SPEEDMAN Oh,, shit-- can you hang on a sec, D? He switches over,, but it takes a few seconds with the hooks.

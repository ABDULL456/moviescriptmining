100. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER 
From the window, we see that the sand below is rippling, like water with a big fish just under the surface. 
KYNES (into radio, after having found the frequency) Calling Harvester Pad Nine. Wormsign! 
STATIC... then a voice. 
VOICE (over radio) Who calls Pad Nine? 
GURNEY (quickly) Don't mention the Duke... This is an uncoded channel. 
KYNES Unlisted flight northeast of you... wormsign on intercept course... estimated contact fifteen minutes. 
VOICE (over radio) Have sighting confirmed. Stand by for fix. Contact in sixteen minutes minus. Very precise estimate. Who is on that unlisted flight? 
Kynes clicks off the radio. 
DUKE LETO What happens now? 
KYNES The carryall will come and lift off the spice harvester. Try and get in close over the harvester... you'll find this interesting Sire. The Duke accelerates the ornithopter in the direction of the harvester. Paul can SEE... 
101. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY 
...huge amounts of sand being spewn out of the gigantic stack atop the metal and plasteel harvester. 
102. INT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER - DAY 
KYNES They'll work until the very last minute. 
The yellow cloud of the harvester envelops them. The Duke flies up to get a closer look. 
VOICE (over radio) Spotter control... no sign of the carryall... it isn't answering. 
Everyone looks at one another. 
GURNEY The worm is eight minutes away, Sire. 
VOICE (over radio) Spotter control -- give me a report by the numbers. 
Over the radio MANY VOICES report they have no contact with the carryall. 
DUKE LETO Damn it... Harkonnens. 
He punches a control button and grabs a microphone. 
DUKE LETO (CONT'D) (into microphone) We are coming down to take you off the harvester... All spotters are ordered to comply. 
VOICE (over radio) Ordered by whom? DUKE LETO (angrily) Duke Leto Atreides.... 
Gurney and Paul turn to each other, worried. 
VOICE (over radio) Yes... yes, Sire! 
DUKE LETO How many men do you have? 
VOICE (over radio) Full crew -- twenty-six men -- but Sire, we can't leave this spice... 
DUKE LETO Damn the spice! Get out of there. 
103. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY 
All the spotters begin landing and the Duke descends directly in front of the harvester which has stopped mining yet emits a tremendous rythmic GRINDING noise. No one is coming out. 
104. INT./EXT. ATREIDES ORNITHOPTER/DESERT - DAY 
Gurney nervously scans the sky for enemy ships. A very low, powerful SOUND starts now and the ground begins to shake. 
105. EXT. HARVESTER - DESERT - DAY 
A hatch opens and MEN come pouring out.

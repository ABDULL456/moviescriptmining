{"train": "THUNDERBIRDS \nWritten by \nPeter Hewitt, William Osborne & Michael McCullers \nAnimated scenes of the Thunderbirds on various rescues begin to play as some of the cast and crew names show up. \nNARRATOR From a secret island in the South Pacific, the courageous Tracy family run an organization called International Rescue. When disaster strikes, anywhere in the world, they are always first on the scene. They go by the name they gave their incredible machines, the Thunderbirds. \n(Counts down numbers and shows corresponding Thunderbirds) Five, four, three, two, one. Thunderbirds are go! \nCuts to live action, Alan Tracy is looking out a school window. \nBut in this family of heroes, there is one son left behind. \nTEACHER So, gentlemen, we all know that A2 plus B2 equals... C2, that's right. But what happens when we bring in Leonardo Da Vinci's E, F and... (Teacher notices Alan looking out window and not paying attention to the lesson) Mr. Tracy! \nFERMAT Alan. Alan! \nAlan's head jerks back from the window and to the teacher who is now standing in front of him. \nTEACHER How kind of you to come back from outer space, Alan. I trust re-entry wasn't too rough? \n(Chuckles sarcastically and continues sounding even more annoyed) Here on Earth we've been discussing the Pythagorean theorem. Did any of that happen to sink in? \nALAN TRACY I was just... \nTEACHER Apparently not (she picks up his notebook which he has been doodling in) \"Thunderbirds are go.\" \nWell, I hope you aren't going anywhere special over spring break, Alan. Because I expect a 10,000 word paper on my desk the day you get back. That should keep you busy. \nBells rings dismissing the students and Alan and Fermat walk out to their lockers. \nALAN (mocking the teacher) \"That should keep you busy. Yeah, well you can take your 10,000 words and stick them right up your...\" \nFERMAT Alan! \nBoth boys turn around to see the headmaster approaching them while walking by with the teacher from before \nALAN Headmaster. \nHEADMASTER Mr. Tracy! \nALAN Miss Garrett. \nFERMAT You gotta be more careful Alan. \nALAN Why can't I tell 'em I'm a Thunderbird Fermat? \nFERMAT Because technically you're not a Thunderbirds yet. And if your identity was discovered, it would a d-d-di- it could be very bad. \nALAN I know, I know. \nEXCITED KID It's the Thunderbirds. They're gonna be on TV. Let's go! They're gonna be on TV. \nALAN Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Where are they? \nEXCITED KID In Russia, at an oil rig fire. \nCREW MEMBER Come on! Jump! \nVIRGIL Okay, I've got a visual. Hold it there. Targets locked. Firing rescue lines. (Directed toward the \ncrew members who he just fired the rescue lines toward) Come on, guys, hook 'em up. We gotta get \nyou out of here. \nCREW MEMBER READY \nANOTHER CREW MEMBER HOIST AWAY! \nJEFF Alright, let's haul them out. \nFERMAT Commencing reverse thrust. \nJEFF Okay, let's bring 'em home. \nCREW MEMBER Look out! (a couple of crew members bump into each other as they are hoisted up) \nALAN Man they gotta get 'em out fast. That rig's gonna blow. \nCREW MEMBER Hang on! \nBoys watching the TV gasp as the crew goes down back toward the water a little bit \nJEFF Whoa sorry, boys. Hold on tight. Here we go. \nALAN Come on, Virgil. \nVIRGIL Hold on guys \nJEFF How you doing, son? \nVIRGIL Never better \nJEFF Thunderbird 1, commence knockdown procedure. \nSCOTT FAB, Thunderbird 2. (after pressing a bunch of buttons on his control panel) Lining up target. \nFire! \nJEFF Bull's-eye! Outstanding shot. All right boys, let's take these babies home. \nLISA LOWE As you can see the fire has been extinguished. The rocket fired from Thunderbird 1 has \nrobbed it of the oxygen it needed to burn. Amazing! The Thunderbirds have done it again, Chuck! ' \nThe boys watching the TV with Alan and Fermat begin cheering. \nCHUCK That was great work, Lisa. Thanks a lot. \nKNOW IT ALL KID (directed at Alan) Ooh, I wish I could be a Thunderbird one \nday. Thunderturd! \nThe boys in the room \"ooohh\" and look at Alan for a response \nALAN That's another good one, diaper boy. \nLADY PENELOPE Oh and apparently England won the football last night. \nPARKER Yes! Eng-er-land! (his hands go off the steering wheel and the car begins to move to one side) \nFERMAT AND ALAN Whoa! \nLADY PENELOPE Calm down, Parker. \nPARKER Yes, milady. Sorry, milady. \nSCENE CHANGE TO San Francisco City Hospital California, USA parking lot. \nPANHEAD'S MOTHER Come on, baby. Out you jump. (Turns to her teenage son who has a pan stuck on \nhis head) Wait till your father hears about this, panhead! They are walking toward the hospital \nentrance when she sees the lights of Thunderbird 2 Aliens! \nPANHEAD Even better! It's the Thunderbirds! \nVIRGIL OK, lock it up. Let's go. Let's move it. Hey, we need some help over here. \nJEFF Mission complete. Thunderbird 1 we are good to go. \nSCOTT FAB. \nMullion walks away from the others and fires a tracking goo at Thunderbird 1. \nScene switches to a moving underwater submarine \nMALE COMPUTER VOICE Tracking device, activated. \nTHE HOOD Ah, the chariot of the gods. Having dallied with the mortals, \nthey return to Olympus. And so I follow. \nPARKER Pardon me, milady. Approaching Tracy Island. And radar indicates we have some company. \nThunderbird 1 and 2 pull up next to Lady Penelope's flying car and Scott waves at Alan before Alan \nturns to look at Thunderbird 2 where his father salutes at him. Thunderbird 1 then does a barrel roll \naround Thunderbird 2 before they both jet off toward the island, leaving Lady Penelope's car behind. \nLADY PENELOPE Now, that's showing off. \nALAN I wish that was me. \nBRAINS I'm about to run post flight checks, Mr Tracy. Anything I sh-sh-sh- \nAnything you want to tell me? \nJEFF Brains, I noticed a build-up of vibration on Thunderbird 2, followed by illumination of the number 5 \nengine out light. \nBRAINS Okay, Mr. Tracy, I'll ch-ch-ch-study the flight data and guidance processor. \nALAN Dad! \nKYRANO By the pool. \nJEFF Of course. \nLADY PENELOPE (answers her ringing cell phone) Parker. \nScene changes to Alan and Fermat about to enter Thunderbird 1's silo. \nFERMAT We're not supposed to go in there. We could get in trouble. \nALAN Ah, you worry too much. \nFERMAT Where'd you get the access code for Thunderbird 1 anyway? \nALAN Fermat, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you. \nScene changes back to Lady Penelope and Jeff by the pool \nLADY PENELOPE I'll be right there. It seems the fire at the oil rig was no accident. \nJEFF Any suspects? \nLADY PENELOPE Not yet, but I'll keep you posted. \nALAN Thanks for bringing Alan home. \nLADY PENELOPE My pleasure. Any excuse to visit paradise. \nJEFF Tintin! \nTINTIN Hey, Mr. Tracy. \nLADY PENELOPE Hello, Tintin. \nTINTIN Good evening, Lady Penelope. \nJEFF Did you know Alan's home? \nTINTIN (makes an annoyed face) Alan's back? (changes her tone to a more pleasant one) I mean, oh, \nAlan's back! (looks at Kyrano) Hey, Dad. \nJEFF When are those two going to get along? \nLADY PENELOPE When Tintin decides the time is right. Girls always fire ahead of boys with that sort of \nthing. \nJEFF What sort of thing? \nLADY PENELOPE (rolls her eyes) Romance. \nJEFF Alan and Tintin? I didn't see that one coming. \nLADY PENELOPE No, you wouldn't. \nJEFF Have a safe flight home, Penny. \nLADY PENELOPE Thanks, Jeff. \nlooks at him) Do you? \nALAN Yeah, I understand. I understand you don't want me to be a Thunderbird. You don't want me to \ndo anything. You won't even listen to me when I'm trying to tell you something important! \nJEFF I've heard enough. You're grounded for the rest of spring break. \nALAN But, Dad! \nJEFF Bottom line, Alan. You need to grow up. \nALAN Then let me. (he stalks toward the door before whispering,) Please! \nJeff is starting at two old family photos on his desk when the video phone rings. \nJEFF Hey, John. I was just about to turn in. What can I do for you? \nJOHN TRACY I could sure use a pizza. You know a place that delivers? \nJEFF 30 minutes or it's free, right? Anything else on your mind? \nJOHN Well, got a forest fire in Vladivostok, a typhoon heading for Singapore. What's happening on \nPlanet Tracy? \nJEFF Alan's home for spring break. \nJOHN Yeah, I thought I could see a storm brewing in your region. \nJEFF Teenagers. \nJOHN Well, we've all been there. And Dad, you've done a great job since Mom died. \nJEFF Thanks, John. Keep an eye on that typhoon for us. And, uh, I'll call Vladivostok, see if they need \nhelp with that fire. \nJOHN FAB, Dad. Sleep tight. \nFermat is down with his father in the Thunderbirds hanger. \nFERMAT Morning, Dad. \nBRAINS Hey, son. There's something I'd like to sh-sh-sh- Here, take a look. \nFERMAT The neural-net control system? \nBRAINS It's great to have you back. I bet you didn't think spring break was going to be this w- w-fun. \nWatch this. \nBrains uses the neural-net control system to lift up the phone in front of him. It also lifts up the Mole \nwhich is stationed behind his workplace. \nBRAINS And that tiny phone lifts up, perfect. \nFERMAT Dad? \nswitches over to Tracy Island. \nBrains and Fermat run into Jeff's office. \nBRAINS Switching to Command and Control Center. (Brains uses a palm scanner to activate Command \nand Control) \nThe submarine is briefly showed getting closer to the island. \nJeff, Scott, Virgil, and Gordon come running into Command and Control. \nJEFF How bad, Brains? \nBRAINS Thunderbird 5 major damage sustained. Possible m-m-m-Possible strike by m- \nJEFF Meteor? \nBRAINS Yep. \nJEFF Thunderbirds are go. \nScene change to inside Thunderbird 3. \nGORDON Check retros. Go. \nJEFF Go to maximum thrust. \nScene switches to the submarine. \nTHE HOOD There goes the cavalry. But who will rescue the rescuers? \nScene changes to Alan on the beach looking up at Thunderbird 3 launching and heading toward \nThunderbird 5. Tintin runs up beside him and looks up as well. \nFERMAT Alan! Tintin! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 5 has been hit! Thunderbird 5 has been \nhit! \nALAN Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay, Okay don't panic. Don't panic. \nThe children look toward the beach when they hear a noise and see the submarine beginning to \nsurface. \nALAN On the other hand. \nALAN, FERMAT, TINTIN Run! \nThe kids run and hide behind some trees and shrubs. Scene then switches to inside the submarine. \nMULLION We made land. \nTHE HOOD (directed toward Transom) Cut them off. \nTRANSOM Activating communications blackout. \nScene switch to Brains in Command and Control \nMULLION (Looks and door and pops his joints) I love a challenge. \nScene changes to right outside the Tracy house as the kids are approaching the vents. \nFERMAT Watch out for the guards. \nALAN Get in, get in. \nScene switches to Brains sitting nervously in the Command and Control room, whistling nervously to \nhimself and reading a magazine upside down. On the other side of the door there is muffled banging \nfrom where Mullion is trying to break open the door. \nBRAINS (Door bursts open and Mullion, Transom, and the Hood walk in) Who-o-o-o- What's going on? \nTHE HOOD So, this is Mount Olympus. And these are the Thunderbirds. I should have guessed. Jeff \nTracy, the billionaire, ex-astronaut, of course. Isn't he the one who lost his wife in an accident? \nAvalanche wasn't it? How tragic. \nScene switches to Alan, Tintin, and Fermat walking in the vents toward the one that leads to the \nCommand and Control room. \nALAN (Whispers) Just keep going straight ahead. \nTINTIN (whispers) Okay. \nScene switches back to Command and Control room. \nTRANSOM Professor Hackenbacker? We met at last year's international conference on \nnanotechnology. I thought your thesis on neutrinos was extremely, stimulating. \nTHE HOOD Transom, concentrate! \nTRANSOM Sorry, sir. The command control switch, is here. Fingerprint recognition system. \nTHE HOOD Professor. Please. Activate the control switch. \nBRAINS N-n-n-n-n- You must be kidding. \nTHE HOOD Professor, you and I share an interest in the science of the mind. The difference is, I was \nborn with my powers. Trust me when I tell you, you've barely touched the surface. (Brains is forced to \nstand up and walked over to the Hood) Even the strongest minds can be broken. It would be a pity to \nbreak yours. \nBRAINS Fu-Fu-Fu- No way! \nTHE HOOD Activate the control switch, Prof! (Uses his powers to make BRAINS move) Like a puppet on \na string! (laughs) \nBrains hand touches the activation pad. \nBank of London. The world's monetary system will be thrown into chaos and the Thunderbirds held \nresponsible. \nSCOTT You'll never get away with it. \nJEFF Why the Thunderbirds? \nTHE HOOD An eye for an eye, Mr. Tracy. \nJEFF An eye for an eye? \nTHE HOOD Perhaps you've forgotten me, but surely you remember saving the life of my brother, \nKyrano? \nKYRANO Turns to the video phone that the Hood has been using to communicate with Thunderbird \nI'm sorry, Mr. Tracy. I thought he was dead. \nTHE HOOD (Laughs and then turns to the guards)Take them away. \nMULLION Yes, sir. \nThe kids lift their heads back up into the vents \nALAN Whoa. \nTINTIN That makes The Hood my uncle? \nFERMAT Every family has a black sh-sh- a black sh- (Sneezes and everyone in the Command and \nControl room looks around, while Brains pretends that it was him that sneezed.) \nFERMAT (Turns to look at Alan) This room's murder with my allergies. \nThe kids stick their heads back out the vent and look at what is going on in the Command and Control \nroom. \nTHE HOOD You left me to die that day. You may have broken my body but you've no idea how \npowerful my mind has become. And now you will suffer, as I suffered, waiting for a rescue that will \nnever come. (Makes a motion for Transom to cut off the call with Thunderbird 5.) \nJEFF Wait! (Video link cuts dead and then the scene cuts to Thunderbird 5.) Scott, status report. \nSCOTT CO2 levels are rising. \nJEFF Alright, wire the oxygen scrubber to the emergency batteries. Clean the air. \nVIRGIL How long will that give us? \nJOHN About four hours. \nScene switches back to the kids looking into the Command and Control room. Fermat begins to start \nsneezing again. Tintin and Alan put their hands over his nose and mouth to try and muffle the sound.) \nTINTIN Hey, watch it! \nFERMAT I took microbiology, not driver's ed. Set the pressure to maximum. \nTINTIN Got it. \nMULLION (The guards walk out of the elevator and see Tintin pointing the Firefly at them) Retreat! \n(They fall over and have trouble getting up due to the slipperiness of the stuff fired at them) \nTINTIN Let's move it. \nALAN That's it. Time to thunderize. (After the door has a hole cut in it.) Yes! \nALAN Come on, let's go! \nMULLION Get 'em! \nALAN Where's Fermat? \nTINTIN Fermat! \nALAN Fermat! \nFERMAT Coming! \nALAN Hurry up. (the children are now in Thunderbird 1's silo) What were you doing back there, \nFermat? \nFERMAT I had an-n-n idea. \nALAN Just try and keep up, okay? I'll open the tunnel. We gotta keep moving. (Alan types in a pass \ncode) \nALAN (To Tintin and Fermat) Go back. Yell when you see them coming. (tries another pass code) \nAlan turns away from the door for a moment and the camera can see The Hood on the other side of \nthe door. Alan turns back and sees him. \nTHE HOOD Alan. You can run if you want. Were you surprised to hear what your father did to me? It is \nfrightening when we realize our parents aren't perfect. But perhaps you already suspected that about \nyour father. Why did he build these magnificent machines? Do you suppose it was guilt? Because he \nlet your mother die. (Alan shakes his head no) Open the door, Alan. (Alan continues to shake his head \nno) (The Hood chuckles at his refusal) Open, the, door. (He tries to use his powers on Alan but nothing \nhappens) \nALAN (Shouting to Tintin and Fermat) We can't go this way. He's there. \nThe Hood uses his powers to open the door and Mullion and the other guards appear at the other \ndoorway, leaving the children trapped. \nTINTIN Boo! \nALAN No, c'mon Tintin, stay there. \nTINTIN You're worse than a couple of girls. Hurry up and get dressed. (To Fermat) Those are nice \ndrawers! \nScene switches to the children walking along one of the beaches. \nFERMAT Data from Tracy Island is sent to Thunderbird 5 via satellite, right? \nALAN Right. \nFERMAT So, there's a miniscule possibility that if we reach the satellite station, we could \nALAN Blow it up! \nFERMAT No, we could hack in to it and give control back to Thunderbird 5. \nALAN Good thinking, Fermat. Alright, let's do it. (Alan starts drawing the plan in the sand) Here's the \nplan. We're here, right?. So, we go along the shore around the base of the mountain to the access road, \nhere. And then up to the transmitter. So what do you think? \nTINTIN Good. Except that we're here, not there, and the transmitter is there, not here. We have to go \nthrough the jungle. \nFERMAT But that's f-f- off limits. \nTINTIN It's gonna be dangerous. \nALAN I'm in. (All three of them put their hands together) We gotta get up there fast! All our folks are \nin trouble and if The Hood gets off the island \nFERMAT Actually, he's not going anywhere for now. \nALAN The guidance processor for Thunderbird 2. You can't take off without it. Fermat you're a genius. \nHow'd you get this? \nFERMAT Alan, my friend, what you don't know, can't hurt you. \nScene switches to Lady Penelope's Country Mansion in England, where Parker is out cleaning a car \nwhen the car phone rings. \nLADY PENELOPE Parker? \nPARKER Milady? \nLADY PENELOPE We have an emergency. \nScene switch to Lady Penelope's bathroom \nLADY PENELOPE What a charming fellow. \nFERMAT What do you mean, Alan? \nALAN Maybe he can read minds or control minds or something. \nFERMAT Don't be silly, Alan. Everything can be explained by science. \nALAN I'm just trying to figure out his weakness. Everybody has an Achilles heel, right? \nFERMAT My Achilles heel is actually my Achilles heel. It's got a blister the size of a basketball. Tintin! \nCan we s-s- \nTINTIN Stop? \nFERMAT Yes! \nTINTIN No! \nFERMAT (sighs) Okay. \nALAN (Helping Fermat up the hill) No more cheeseburgers for you, Fermat. \nScene change back to Lady Penelope's house. \nLADY PENELOPE Any word? \nPARKER Nothing, milady. \nLADY PENELOPE Right. You will have to tell Lord Marlborough that I've broken my shooting arm. We \nshall send the Institute for the Blind a dozen guide dogs. And bring the car around. \nPARKER Yes, milady. \nLADY PENELOPE The Thunderbirds appear to be in a spot of trouble. And I don't like that. Let's go, \nParker. \nThey get in the car and it takes off flying toward Tracy Island. Scene switches to Mullion and the Hood \nin the Thunderbirds hanger. \nMULLION Ready for launch. We'll use this to get into the vaults. \nTHE HOOD Subtle, as usual, Mullion. \nMULLION I didn't realize we'd be getting points for style. We're robbing banks, remember. \nThe Hood uses his power on Mullion and Mullion gasps. \nTHE HOOD Don't worry. You'll get your money. \nMULLION (Looks over toward Thunderbird 2 and speaks into headset) Transom, initiate pre-flight \ndiagnostics. \nAn alarm suddenly goes off in Thunderbird 2. \nMULLION What's going on? \nFERMAT You think? \nALAN Must run in the family. Did you do that? \nTINTIN Just drop it, okay? \nALAN Still think everything can be explained by science? \nFERMAT Not girls! \nScene cuts to Thunderbird 5 where there is an alarm and then an explosion near Scott and Gordon. \nJEFF Scott? Gordon? You all right? \nGORDON We're okay. \nSCOTT The heat exchanger has blown. \nJEFF You don't say. \nScene switches back to Mullion and two other guards searching the jungle for Alan, Tintin, and \nFermat. \nMULLION Come on! Those brats are in here somewhere. \nScene change to the kids at the satellite transmitter. \nALAN How we doing Fermat? \nFERMAT Don't rush me Alan. This is very d-delicate equipment. (The circuit board sparks.) Which is \nnow b-b-broken. \nALAN Can you fix it? \nFERMAT Yea- Maybe, but I'll need something to solder with. \nALAN We're in the middle of nowhere Fermat, where are you going to find something like that. (Tintin \nand Fermat see Alan's retainer and share a look) What? \nAlan yells as Tintin and Fermat pull out the metal part of Alan's retainer. \nALAN Ow! \nFERMAT Perfect. \nTINTIN Gee Alan, I never figured you for a crybaby. \nALAN I'm gonna kill you. \nFERMAT What'd he say? \nTINTIN I think it was some sort of apology. \nFERMAT I got it, yes! Y-y-you the man, Fermat! Okay, first step is to establish contact with Thunderbird \nScene switch to Thunderbird 5 \nALAN Dad! \nAlan throws the video phone \nFERMAT No! \nALAN Useless! \nFERMAT It is now. \nTINTIN I'm sorry, Alan. This is hard on all of us. \nALAN No, it's okay. I'm fine. \nFERMAT You don't have to be such a tough guy Alan. I'm worried about my dad too. \nTINTIN I'd do anything to be with my parents right now. \nALAN But The Hood knows we're alive now. We have to go. \nFERMAT Even worse, they know exactly \nTires screech and Mullion and the guards appear. \nFERMAT Where we are! \nMullion and the other guards watch the kids running down the hillside for a second. \nMULLION Come on! \nThe kids fall down a ditch screaming and into a river. \nFERMAT Great, more water. \nALAN Tintin, can you slow 'em down? \nTINTIN I'd be delighted. \nALAN Then do it. And meet us at the junk yard. Come on, Fermat. \nScene changes to Alan and Fermat discovering a hoversled in the junkyard. \nALAN This'll get us out of here. \nScene change to Mullion hunting Tintin down in the forest. \nMULLION There! Come on! \nTintin looks up and sees a bees hive. \nMULLION Straight ahead. \nTintin uses a limb to hit the bee hive at Mullion and the other two guards. Mullion falls off the car \nand into a puddle while being stung by bees. The scene cuts back to Alan and Fermat in the junkyard \nattaching something to the back of the hoversled so that all three of them can fit on it. \nFERMAT It's gonna make this thing hard to control you know. \nTINTIN I'm fine, Dad. \nMULLION (Grabs Fermat away from Brains and has him sit down on a container) Cool off, kid! (he \nlaughs evilly as he walks out of the fridge and closes the door on the way out) \nScene switch to Park and Lady Penelope approaching Tracy Island. \nPARKER Tracy Island approaching, milady. Switching to aqua mode. \nLADY PENELOPE Isn't life fun, sometimes? \nPARKER Rib-tickling, milady. \nScene switches to Transom and The Hood in Command and Control getting an alarm that an aircraft is \napproaching Tracy Island. \nTHE HOOD What is it? \nTRANSOM We have an unidentified craft approaching the island at high speed. \nScene switches to Alan climbing over a hill and seeing Lady Penelope's car approaching. \nALAN Lady P! \nScene switches to Thunderbird 5 \nJEFF Phew! Somebody roll down a window. It's getting a little hot in here. \nVIRGIL Re-entry into Earth's atmosphere in 37 minutes. \nSCOTT Oxygen's out in 30 so we won't feel it. \nJEFF Stop it! \nGORDON Come on, Dad. The situation's hopeless. \nJEFF No, it's not. There's still time. We've got people on the ground working for us. \nGORDON Alan? He's just a kid! \nJEFF He's a Tracy. \nScene switches quickly to Alan running through the forest and then to Lady Penelope and Parker \nwalking up to the Tracy house \nLADY PENELOPE This doesn't look good, Parker. \nPARKER No, milady. \nLADY PENELOPE That bougainvillea is absolutely parched, and someone should do something about \nthat hideous hammock. \nTHE HOOD (After seeing Lady Penelope and Parker) Whom do we have here? Mullion. \nMULLION I must warn you that I know judo, krai magna, and tae kwon do. \nTHE HOOD (with his back still to Alan) How are you, Alan? (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady \nPenelope and they cry out in pain) (Alan moves to run back into the jungle) I hope you don't think I'm \ngoing to chase you. (he uses his powers on Parker and Lady Penelope and they cry out in pain again) \nYou can make it stop, Alan. (Parker and Lady Penelope cry out again) You have something that belongs \nto me. \nPARKER Really, sir, don't mind me. This isn't the first time my head's been pulverized. And it's never \ndone any real harm before. (The Hood once again uses his powers on them and they cry out in pain \nlouder this time) \nALAN (comes out of his hiding place) Stop! Stop! I'll give it to you. (throws the guidance processor \ntoward the pool) Fetch! (the Hood uses his powers to bring it over to him before it can hit the water) \nTHE HOOD You made a match of it, Alan, I'll give you that. (to Mullion and Transom) Put them with the \nothers. (Transom grabs Parker) \nMULLION (To Lady Penelope and Alan) You're coming with me. (Grabs Alan's arms and throws Lady \nPenelope over his shoulder) \nLADY PENELOPE Put me down! This outfit is couture. \nScene switches to Thunderbird 5. \nJEFF Don't go to sleep. John, look at me. Keep your eyes open. \nScene switches back to the fridge where Mullion and Transom are taking Alan, Lady Penelope, and \nParker. \nMULLION You need to cool off, milady. \nTINTIN Lady Penelope! \nLADY PENELOPE (To Mullion) Big oaf! (The fridge door closes leaving them trapped) Right, that's quite \nenough losing for one day. \nALAN (To Fermat) So, how does it feel to be right all the time? \nFERMAT Not b-bad, actually. \nALAN I'm so sorry, Fermat. \nFERMAT We make quite a pair. It's hard for me to t-t-talk. It's hard for you to l-l-listen. \nLADY PENELOPE Parker, I have an idea. \nPARKER Excellent, milady. \nLADY PENELOPE Brains, how long do Jeff and the boys have? \nBRAINS Thunderbird 1 come in. \nALAN Roger, Brains. \nBRAINS Situation update, Thunderbird 3 is about to initiate separation. \nALAN AND FERMAT FAB. \nLADY PENELOPE Boys, Thunderbird 2 is in final approach to London. \nALAN I know The Hood's weakness, Fermat. I can stop him if we get there in time. \nFERMAT Stand by. We're going to maximum thrust. \nALL Whoaaaa! \nScene switches to Thunderbird 3 separating from Thunderbird 5 \nJEFF Gordon, heat 'em up. \nThunderbird 2 lands in a park near the London Eye and causes panic. \nCHUCK We're getting reports of some kind of incident in London involving the Thunderbirds. Lisa, are \nyou there? \nLISA LOWE Chuck, I'm here in Jubilee Gardens where Thunderbird 2 has made an impromptu landing, \ncausing total panic in Central London. As far as we know there has been no emergency call from this \narea so it's unclear why Thunderbird 2 would be active here at all. I don't know if you can see this Chuck \nbut Thunderbird 2 seems to be unloading some kind of machine. \nScene changes to inside the Mole with Transom, Mullion, and The Hood. \nTHE HOOD Set a course for the vault. \nTRANSOM Sir, if we continue on our present course, we'll sever the monorail's subterranean supports. \nShall I correct our position? \nTHE HOOD Stay on course. \nTRANSOM But sir, we'll cause a major disaster. \nTHE HOOD No, we won't. The Thunderbirds will. \nThe Mole severs the subterranean support leaving one monorail car stranded in the air. Scene then \nswitches to Thunderbird 1 \nLADY PENELOPE Let's get her down, boys. \nALAN Initiate landing, Fermat. \nFERMAT Right. \nALAN Retros at 75 flaps to 16. \npain and lets go) \nTHE HOOD Goodbye, Alan! (Steps on the other hand and Alan yells in pain) (Tintin runs into the room) \nTINTIN No! \nTHE HOOD Ah, (uses his powers on her) (She uses her powers on him as well) Oh! \n(The catwalk flips over making Alan safely on top and the Hood dangling above the still active Mole. \nTHE HOOD Leave me, Alan. Leave me to die. (releases one hand from the railing) Like your father did. \nALAN I don't want to save your life. (the Hood lets his other hand go, but Alan grabs it) But it's what we \ndo. \nScene switches to The Hood, Mullion, and Transom being led to a police car outside the Bank of \nLondon when Thunderbirds 1,2, and 3 fly above them. \nTHE HOOD See you soon, Jeff. \nPARKER (To Lady Penelope as she climbs in the car) Now, that was definitely showing off. \nScene changes to back at Tracy Island.

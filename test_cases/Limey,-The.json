{"train": "WILSON \nWalking past, almost subliminally noting the Young Woman with the symbol of death on her. \nTABLE \nA .45 passed from a DEALER's hand to Wilson's. \nDEALER Man knows what he likes. \nED (he'll talk if Wilson won't) Lookin' good. \nDEALER (while Wilson checks) That's a high-end item.  Total reliability. \nED What'd you call that -- the Protector? \nDEALER Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market. \nWilson's eyes glance up -- but Ed asks the question. \nED CQ what? \nDEALER Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home. \nWILSON Trouble is, I'm not at home, see. Fancied a bit of target shooting, y'know, while I'm here -- with me mate. \nNods at Ed. \nDEALER Oh really?  Where you from? \nWILSON England. (sighting the weapon) Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing. \nDEALER You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster? \nWILSON Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before. \nDEALER You're in gun country now, my friend. \nWILSON (picks up another, checks it out) Been to the Boat Show. \nDEALER (re Wilson's new selection) Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece. \nED (playing the reluctant buyer) He don't have a concealed weapons permit. \nWILSON Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit. \nDEALER I can take care of the paperwork. \nWILSON Yeah? \nDEALER No problem.  If you don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen. \nA look of understanding between them. \nWILSON No.  Not at all. (to Ed) Do we? \nED Not me, man. \nWILSON I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one? \nDEALERS Well, I'll have to add another two hundred on top of that. \nWILSON Oh, aye? \nDEALER (another look) ... for the paperwork. \nCUT. \nINT. ED'S CAR.  DAY. \nEd drives.  Nervous at Wilson handling his new gun purchase beside him. \nWILSON Violation of my parole, this. (a perfect pause) -- Goin' abroad. \nEd shakes his head at Wilson's sense of humor. \nED You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month. \nWILSON Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed. \nAs he puts away a box of ammo. \nED Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom. \nINT. WAREHOUSE. \nA SUPERVISOR (the one from the flash cuts) does a double take as Wilson passes. \nSUPERVISOR Hey! \nWilson stops and turns.  Says nothing. \nSUPERVISOR How'd you get in here. \nWILSON Walked. \nSUPERVISOR You walked. (coming over) What the hell are you doing here. \nWILSON Looking for a bloke named Valentine. Know him? \nMEAT PUPPETS (who we saw before as well) who work here gathering.  The Supervisor and the Meat Puppets exchange glances. \nSUPERVISOR He's expecting you? \nWILSON (beat) I doubt it. \nThe Supervisor moves toward Wilson. \nSUPERVISOR So why would he want to see you. \nWILSON I have a message for him.  About Jennifer Wilson. \nSUPERVISOR Jennifer Wilson. \nMore looks are exchanged. \nWILSON You know her? \nSUPERVISOR Yeah.  I know her, all right.  She came down here once, stirred up a shitstorm. We lost a full day's work, took me weeks to get back on schedule.  If she hadn't a' been Terry's woman I would've broke her jaw.  'Course, she's nobody's problem now. \nWilson stares at him. \nWILSON Is Valentine here? \nSUPERVISOR What do you think? \nWilson looks at the Meat Puppets, the loading area. \nWILSON Where is he, then? \nSUPERVISOR Listen, get the fuck out of here before you get hurt.  Who the fuck do you think you are, waltzing in here, asking questions? \nWilson just looks at him. \nSUPERVISOR Do you hear me, asshole? \nThe Supervisor shoves him.  The Meat Puppets move a little in anticipation.  Wilson isn't giving any indication that he's going to leave. \nSUPERVISOR Jesus, you really want your ass kicked, don't you? \nHe pushes Wilson again, hard. \nSUPERVISOR Go on, get outta here. \nHe pushes Wilson again.  Still, Wilson won't leave. \nSUPERVISOR Fuckin' nut.  Go on. \nThis time he tries to slap Wilson.  Wilson blocks the Supervisor's hand and then punches him, hard.  The Supervisor stumbles back and falls to the floor. \nTHE MEAT PUPPETS \nMove to Wilson.  He tries to fend them off, but there are too many.  They beat him.  When they find that he's armed, they beat him harder. \nCUT. \nEXT. BUILDING.  DAY. \nWilson is taken outside and dumped.  After a moment, he gets to his feet.  Dusting himself.  Reaches for ANOTHER GUN tucked in his lower back.  He re-enters the building. \nA beat.  We hear several SHOTS. \nSeconds later, one of the Meat Puppets comes stumbling out of the door, terrified.  He runs past us, fast. \nA moment later, Wilson emerges, gun in hand. \nWILSON You tell him.  You tell him I'm coming!! \nVALENTINE That's what Gordon's always saying. \nADHARA Oh, god. \nHis cell phone rings. \nVALENTINE (into phone) Yes. \nHe listens, then looks up at his balcony, where a MAN (AVERY) stands holding a phone, obviously talking to Valentine. \nVALENTINE (into phone) I'll be there as soon as I can. \nHe hangs up. \nVALENTINE (cont'd) We can leave as soon as you're ready. \nADHARA Okay. \nEXT. BALCONY.  EVENING. \nValentine approaches Avery. \nVALENTINE What. \nAVERY There's been some trouble downtown. \nVALENTINE What kind? \nAVERY What the papers used to call a \"gangland slaying.\" \nVALENTINE Our black friends? \nAVERY No, Terry.  They don't work like that. Jenny Wilson's father paid a little visit, left a message. \nVALENTINE I thought he was in prison, in England. \nAVERY Well, either they have a very liberal work-release program, or he's out, because he's here in L.A., looking for you. \nValentine is a little ruffled.  Maybe Avery likes that. \nVALENTINE What do we do? \nBeat. \nAVERY We wait, and we watch. \nValentine just looks at him. \nEXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  POOLSIDE.  EVENING. \nAdhara approaches Valentine, who stands staring at the pool. \nADHARA Italian? \nVALENTINE I'm sorry. \nADHARA Italian. \nVALENTINE Who? \nADHARA Not who, food.  Should we get Italian. \nVALENTINE Sure. \nTurns to her. \nVALENTINE (cont'd) Yes.  Are you ready? \nADHARA As long as I don't have to pass Gordon again.  I'm never ready for that. \nHe smiles, rises, and offers her his hand. \nVALENTINE No.  I know another way out. \nShe takes it. \nCUT. \nEXT. APARTMENT BUILDING.  EVENING. \nELAINE on her way in.  Handsome woman.  Intelligent, capable- looking.  Passes Wilson who's leaning somewhere smoking. \nELAINE \nWILSON ... No, I went in for more improving pastimes.  Philosophy classes, language courses, European history, all that lark. Did you know that in Paris in the Eighteenth Century there were more rats in people's houses than there were people in people's houses. \nELAINE Sounds like Beverly Hills. \nWILSON Here, are you always this sarky? \nELAINE Sarcastic, moi?  Maybe I'll mellow when my ship comes in.  It's expected any day now.  I'm all packed and ready to go. \nWILSON Weren't you on a television series? \nELAINE (has he seen it?) If it played in England somebody owes me money.  Who told you that -- Eddie? \nWILSON (yes) Said it went on for donkey's years. \nELAINE Three seasons.  They found that's the limit of human tolerance when it comes to following the adventures of a family of Mormons on the Chisum Trail. (blinks coquettishly) I was wife number three -- the ingenue. \nWILSON Oh, it just ended, then. \nELAINE Now who's being sarcastic? \nWILSON When you've lost as many years as I have, love, puts things in perspective, know what I mean. \nELAINE I'm sorry.  I guess the rest of us have no excuse for wondering where the time went. (raises her drink) It must've been the bars. \nTheir food arrives. \nELAINE It's a kind of prison, doing a series. Early to bed, early to rise, no time off for good behavior, you grab the boodle for as long as it lasts. (the kicker) Only difference is you can't get arrested afterwards. \nWilson appears fascinated by the cold glasses of water on the table.  Ice cubes CLINKING as he holds his.  A BUSBOY bringing them to other people, too, just like that, without anyone even asking. \nWILSON I can't believe Jenny told you all that. About me.  She was always so embarrassed. \nELAINE Not embarrassed. \nWILSON (correcting) Ashamed. \nELAINE Not ashamed. \nWilson looks at her.  Okay.  What then. \nELAINE Disappointed. \nWILSON She never told Eddie, though. \nELAINE She never told anyone else. (making light now) About the convict strain -- or is it stain?  No, I was privileged.  I was someone who helped Jenny efface her past. \nWILSON How'd you manage that, then. \nELAINE When I'm not honing my craft in episodic television I do double-duty as a voice coach.  Not that her accent would have hobbled her progress.  Not with that look. \nWILSON Yeah, well, she started all that in London. \nELAINE Modelling. \nWILSON Learnin' 'ow to speak proper. (putting it on a bit there. Then, upper crust:) Central School of Speech and Drama. It's no doddle gettin' in there, y'know. At seventeen.  They offered her a place at RADA n' all, only she'd've had to wait till the next session and she was always in hurry to get on, was Jenny.  She could talk posh without any training, when she was knee-high to a grasshopper. (indicating himself) Show up the old man, you know. \nElaine smiles slightly.  None of this information new to her. But warming to this man. \nELAINE You weren't disappointed in her, then. \nWILSON In Jenny?  'Course not.  How could I be. 'Course I wasn't. \nELAINE She was twenty-one when she came to me. (looks at him) ... Straight from leaving you. \nWILSON Footloose and fancy free. \nELAINE She was happy here.  However the two of you might have parted.  Don't think she wasn't. \nIt's because Wilson thinks the opposite that he's here. Looks at Elaine. \nWILSON That's the trouble, n' it. (hard as nails again) She enjoyed life. \nCUT. \nEXT. OCEANFRONT.  NIGHT. \nThey walk along the seafront.  We HEAR the ocean but can't see it. \nELAINE When did you get in? \nWILSON Yesterday.  Afternoon. \nELAINE (occurs to her) You haven't been lurking outside my building all day. \nWILSON Now, you shouldn't run yourself down.  My employer, Mr. Lindgren -- \nELAINE -- Your employer? \nWILSON -- Mr. Lindgren. \nELAINE Who's Mr. Lindgren? \nWILSON My employer. \nELAINE What line is he in. \nWILSON Proprietor of a London firm.  Of longstanding. \nELAINE I see. \nWILSON Based in London, but with international concerns. \nELAINE I bet. \nWILSON Various enterprises, style of thing. \nELAINE I thought you said you never did an honest day's work in your life. \nWILSON Well, not to say Mr. Lindgren is dishonest, exactly. \nELAINE (she gets the picture) Right. \nWILSON Anyhow, he's always saying to me, Dave, never run yourself down, son -- 'cause there'll always be plenty of people willing to do it for you. \nELAINE In what capacity are you employed by this Mr. Lindgren? \nWILSON This and that.  Y'know.  Ways and means. \nELAINE -- When he wants someone run down, you're willing to do it for him. \nThey sort of come together -- in mutual understanding -- and sit down.  Coffee steaming. \nELAINE So what's the deal.  You and Terry Valentine at twenty paces.  Is that what this is about. \nWILSON Why not. \nELAINE Are you serious. \nWILSON Have you ever known me not to be. \nElaine looks away: \nELAINE You fuckin' guys and your dicks. \nWILSON What'd you want me to do.  Stay at home, twiddlin' me thumbs.  Doing sweet F.A. [Fuck All]. \nELAINE You don't believe it was a car accident. \nWILSON What do you think. \nELAINE Terry's never going to give you satisfaction.  Not the type. \nWILSON Depends, don' it. \nELAINE On what.  What makes you so certain. \nWILSON I'll bloody well ask him. \nELAINE There's the phone.  You want his number. \nWILSON \nThat look again. \nWILSON I got his number. \nELAINE \nPast caring. \nELAINE I'm not going to help you. \nShe goes into a bathroom.  Shutting the door behind her. \nWILSON \nSips coffee.  Bites into a cookie. \nWILSON First in, first out, that's me. \nLooking over to note the multi-car GARAGE off the main house. \nINT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON. \nWilson and Ed are among the first to arrive.  A smattering of other GUESTS.  Elaborate catered cuisine.  They mosey over to the wet bar. \nBARTENDER Gentlemen.  What can I get you. \nWILSON (suggesting Ed take first crack) Dubonnet with a twist?  Baby sham? Tomato juice and Tabasco sauce? \nBy now his whole dynamic with Ed is a verbal tease. \nED (to Bartender) Got a Coke? \nINT. VALENTINE'S BEDROOM.  AFTERNOON. \nValentine is checking himself in a full-length mirror.  TV on in background, sound low (ENTERTAINMENT WEEK!).  Not quite satisfied, Valentine crosses to the bathroom. \nBATHROOM \nValentine takes one more closer look. \nADHARA (O.S.) You have the same posters. \nValentine turns. \nVALENTINE Hmm? \nADHARA \nIs lounging in the large tub.  Staring dreamily at a couple of framed posters on the walls:  more 60's psychedelia. \nADHARA That you have down at your office. \nValentine sits on the edge of the tub.  With a nostalgic air as he looks at her:  the embodiment of youth. \nVALENTINE Different ones. \nHe strokes her wet skin.  They kiss lightly. \nADHARA I like the colors. \nVALENTINE We all did. \nADHARA It must've been a time.  A golden moment. \nBeat. \nVALENTINE Have you ever dreamed of a place ... you don't really recall ever having been to ... a place that probably doesn't even exist except in your imagination ... somewhere far away, half-remembered when you wake up ... but when you were there you spoke the language, you knew your way around ... (significant pause) That was the 60's. \nWith that exit line (practiced?), he starts to go. \nThen pauses, turns again. \nVALENTINE No, it wasn't.  Wasn't either. \nComes back to her.  Faraway look in his eyes. \nVALENTINE It was '66 ... early '67. (comes back to now) That was all. \nHe goes. \nINT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY.  AFTERNOON. \nWilson wanders around, exploring the house.  Comes to a wall of photographes.  Casually scanning them as he passes slowly by, he's caught up short by one. \nPOV \nA framed photo of JENNY, his daughter. \nWILSON \nA series of emotions play over his face.  He turns -- SEES Valentine coming down the stairs.  Valentine joins the party without noticing him. \nBY THE BUFFET TABLE \nEd peruses the available food.  Valentine comes over to check it out.  Glances at Ed without recognizing him. \nVALENTINE Hi. \nAnd goes away.  Leaving Ed more nervous than ever. \nValentine had turned his attention back to Adhara and her Girlfriend.  When he glances back to the deck he's a little concerned not to see Gordon anywhere out there anymore -- just Wilson coming back in. \nWILSON \nAdjusting his jacket, walking back through the house.  Behind him, people are rushing to the railing and looking over.  A few yells of \"Call an ambulance!\" etc. are heard. \nVALENTINE \nMoves that way. \nWILSON \nMoving across the room towards the front door.  They are heading right toward each other. \nWILSON AND VALENTINE \nPass each other, eyes locked, almost dream-like.  Wilson's eyes cold, though with the hint of a smile.  Valentine throws a last look back before reaching the deck. \nEXT. DECK. \nValentine pushes through to look over the railing. \nHIS POV \nGordon -- a crumpled, inert heap way down the hill below. \nVALENTINE \nTurns to look toward the front door.  Wilson not to be seen. Valentine pushes through the crowd toward the door. \nEXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON. \nValentine emerges in time to see Ed and Wilson pulling away. Wilson looks at him, impassive, through the passenger window. \nAVERY \nIs just arriving in his car.  Valentine gestures at him. Suddenly we HEAR a loud, bass-heavy WHHUUUMMMPPP. \nValentine (and a few others) turn toward the sound, which came from: \nTHE GARAGE \nThere is smoke coming from under the door. \nEXT. CANYON ROAD.  AFTERNOON. \nWilson's car practically tobogganing back down the hill. BOOM!  We hear an explosion from back UP the hill. \nINT. WILSON'S CAR. \nEd jumps -- though he's driving.  The gas pedal his most pressing concern.  Negotiating the dangerously winding road comes second.  Exhilaration mixed with panic. \nWILSON Steady on. \nED You steady on, man.  What the fuck else did you do back there. \nEXT. ROAD. \nAn especially sharp curve looms ahead. \nWILSON \nFlinches, grabs a handhold. \nCURVE \nCar makes it around on two side wheels. \nWILSON \nGulps. \nWILSON Bloody hell. \nEd regains control. \nAVERY \nIn his car, takes a different turn. \nEXT. ROAD.  CAR. \nSwerves some more curves.  Should be some sense here that a similar skyline route would have been taken by Wilson's daughter on her final drive. \nAVERY (more concerned about police presence) What did you tell them. \nValentine blows air, runs a hand through his hair. \nVALENTINE I told them a long-time employee flipped out.  Had a drug problem, refused counselling.  Set the garage on fire, then committed suicide.  One of my \"guests\" tried to stop him -- but how do you stop Gordon. \nIn this context meaning how did that rangy Englishman do it. \nVALENTINE I mean, Gordon must weigh a good four hundred pounds. \nAVERY Heavier than that now.  But are there any drugs in that stomach to back up your story. \nVALENTINE As it happens.  I didn't make that part up. \nAVERY And where is this guest?  Don't they want to interview him. \nVALENTINE I don't know everyone here.  He was so traumatized he split. (another notion) Maybe he was Gordon's pusher. \nAvery stares at Valentine.  Impressed at him thinking on his feet. \nVALENTINE Where do you think he is, Mike. \nAVERY (already turning) We'll find him. \nVALENTINE (stops him) No.  I mean.  Not even your people should be involved.  Right?  It's too close now. \nAVERY You could use a few of my prime shitkickers up here. \nVALENTINE You think I'm staying? \nAVERY There's already gonna be talk about how people close to you keep falling into canyons. \nVALENTINE Well, can we make it one more.  Nowhere the fuck near me. \nHe's being glib, but he's being serious.  His open-handed gesture inquiring of Avery:  are you up to the task? \nAVERY I have other resources. \nHe turns to go. \nEXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  CANYON.  AFTERNOON. \nThe huge dead bulk of Gordon hoisted back up to the deck by a paramedic team. \nINT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. \nValentine comes back in.  In the living room beyond, Adhara stands anxiously, where she's been waiting for him.  Cops visible outside on the deck, peering over the edge. \nVALENTINE \nHeading that way.  Then stops.  Backtracks.  Something peripherally had caught his eye and he returns to it.  His wall of photographs. \nAN EMPTY FRAME \nThe one that had contained the picture of Jenny. \nCUT. \nINT. WILSON'S CAR.  AFTERNOON. \nSafely down the hill.  Driving away in traffic, Ed calmer now. \nWILSON \nPulls the rolled-up photograph of his daughter out of his jacket and looks at it. \nCUT. \nINT. POOL HALL.  NIGHT. \nTwo characters stand, leaning, against a back wall.  Staring ahead, without purpose.  Halfheartedly watching a game of pool in progress.  Just hanging out.  Strange, threatening characters.  One of them is young.  Lean, hungry-looking. STACY is his name.  A shrewd, scheming kid.  But definitely a little unhinged.  Weirder is his companion.  UNCLE JOHN.  The title isn't one of courtesy.  He's an actual blood relative. Maybe 25 years older than Stacy.  But intellectually younger. Physically, much bigger.  The man is huge.  Nevertheless, the safer of the two -- until Stacy tells him otherwise.  Way they're standing next to each other suggests the ease they feel in each other's company.  Tight bond.  They're good buddies. \nAVERY \nWalks in.  Stops to look around.  Spots his two freaks. Walks toward them. \nDOORWAY \nA mysterious black man has followed Avery in.  THOMPSON is his name.  He hangs back and watches. \nAVERY \nMakes contact. \nShe's sitting on the bed now. \nCUT. \nEXT. MEAN STREET.  NIGHT. \nStacy, putting on a jacket that says \"Bomb Hanoi\" comes out of the pool hall.  Uncle John in tow. \nUNCLE JOHN How much. \nSTACY Five thousand. \nUNCLE JOHN (impressed) Hey. \nSTACY (taps pocket) I got half. \nUNCLE JOHN Makin' trouble for someone? \nSTACY Yeah. \nUNCLE JOHN Which kind? \nSTACY The forever kind. \nBEHIND THEM \nThompson, the mysterious black man, watches them from the hall doorway. \nCUT. \nEXT. WILSON'S MOTEL.  MORNING. \nEarly. \nINT. WILSON'S ROOM. \nWilson and Elaine.  Getting dressed.  She's in pantyhose. Fastening a bra.  He's got trousers on, reaching for a shirt. \nWILSON How long've you lived here? \nElaine sits on the bed, fastening her skirt.  Her bra strap cuts across her bare back. \nELAINE This town's been chewing my flesh since ... what we now refer to as \"the early 70's.\" (thinks back) Christ, my past became nostalgia and no one even asked me. \nWILSON Early 70's.  I was away. (tries to remember) Maidstone.  Possibly Brixton. \nELAINE These more highlights from the Zagat prison guide? \nWilson looks at her:  she's the one who goes to bed with ex- cons. \nWILSON You don't seem bothered. \nELAINE You don't know how I've compromised my standards. \nWILSON Tell us about it. \nELAINE It's too involved; a lifetime of non- involvement.  Anywhere else I'd be an interesting little number, here I'm just SAG number forty-eight thousand and one. (quickly) SAG meaning Screen Actor's Guild. \nWILSON Oh, I was gonna say ... \nELAINE Still, there have been rewards.  It's sunny.  And some of the producers who call even have credits. \nWILSON I can see the attraction. \nShe glances up at him to try and see how he means that.  Is he looking at her or out the window? \nELAINE What did you do?  To make them take the early 70's away from you. \nWILSON A jeweller's up the West End.  We tunnelled our way under the shop floor from the public lavatory down the road. Filthy work.  Trouble was, the bloody thing collapsed -- after we'd made the grab, 'n all.  Would you Adam n' Eve it. \nELAINE You mean if they'd nabbed you before you actually broke and entered you would only have been charged with making a mess. \nWILSON We were lucky to be nicked.  Me and the lads went down there Sunday evening, we weren't discovered till the Monday.  Good job we were still breathing. \nELAINE It didn't discourage you, though. \nWILSON Hey? \nELAINE From pursuing your chosen profession. \nWILSON I'll tell ya something:  it made me a model prisoner.  Put me right off any escape attempts.  Tunnel my way to freedom after that experience?  Not bloody likely. \nELAINE I was inside once.  I punched a cop at a demo. \nSTACY (as a fat jogger passes) Good luck. \nSTACY (watching someone else go by) Jesus, are you gay enough or what. \nSTACY (barely out of earshot of a black woman with dyed blonde hair) Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I really want to fuck you. \nSTACY (after a long time in silence, just staring at someone) ... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal. \nSTACY (regarding some other beachgoers) Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it. \nSTACY (reading a newspaper) Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth. \nSTACY (leaning back on his elbows) Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good? \nSTACY (sitting up) Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving? \nUNCLE JOHN I don't know. \nSTACY The L.A.P.D. \nSTACY (observing a \"fast-walker\") Oh yeah, keep doing that.  That's really healthy. \nSTACY (his gaze following another unfortunate) Can't you do something about your ass? \nSTACY (his head turning after someone else) Other people's lives scare the shit out of me. \nSTACY (watching some guy rooting in a trash bin) \"Homeless\" people.  Fuck them.  Remember when they were just bums?  Everyone with an axe to grind.  Like to grind in their face.  Pretty soon there'll be shit-in- your-pants rights groups.  Stupidity activists. \nSTACY (glad he's who he is and not who he's looking at) Wonder what it's like being a dumb guy in a dumb suit trying to cross the street. \nSTACY (staring at another sad couple) Life sure is a minefield. \nSTACY (clocking another female) Look at that one.  She's really been used. \nSTACY (in a contemplative mode) I'd love to be famous so I could snub ordinary people.  Imagine, you're famous, you're sitting in a restaurant, some fool comes up to you, wants you to sign your name on his napkin, his wife is there, it would be something these poor saps would cherish the rest of their lives, talk about to their cretin friends.  Bam!  You tell 'em to FUCK OFF!  God, I'd love that. \nSuddenly Uncle John speaks. \nUNCLE JOHN Is that her?  I bet that's her. \nStacy turns. \nPOV \nAcross the street, Elaine comes out of her building.  (We're supposing this is an apartment building somewhat worth living in that has outdoor parking of some kind, visible from the street, or only street parking.) \nCUT. \nEXT. SOME STREET.  DAY. \nElaine's car on the move.  Stacy and Uncle John in a car following. \nINT. ELAINE'S CAR. \nGoing somewhere.  Unaware of the creeps in her wake. \nINT. STACY/UNCLE JOHN'S CAR. \nAn \"8x10\" of Elaine on their back seat.  Another picture of her on a page torn from a \"Player's Directory.\" \nUNCLE JOHN Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy. \nSTACY (driving) Avery said she was tight with his daughter. \nUNCLE JOHN That don't mean nothin'. \nStacy knows better than to argue with a moron. \nUNCLE JOHN She's nice lookin'. \nSTACY So what. \nUNCLE JOHN I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'. \nSTACY And I said so what.  You think she's any happier? \nUNCLE JOHN What d'you mean, any happier? \nSTACY Any happier than any other asshole in life. \nPause. \nUNCLE JOHN I dunno.  I never met her. \nAT THE STAIRS \nThree BLACK GUYS.  Including Thompson.  They approach.  Guns pointed at Stacy and Uncle John. \nWILSON \nHand on his .45 now.  But a fourth Black Guy coming up behind him.  Wilson lowers the .45. \nELAINE \nFlattened herself back against a wall.  Petrified. \nSTACY \nSits on the floor.  Holds his hurt face.  Thompson walks over and picks up Stacy's gun.  One of the other blacks relieves a reluctant Uncle John of his. \nTHOMPSON (stops at Wilson) Come with us. \nIf there's any doubt whether Wilson will -- one of the blacks gently puts the muzzle of a gun to Elaine's head.  Cocks the hammer. \nThey all go off down the stairwell.  Except Stacy and Uncle John. \nHit men wondering what hit them. \nCUT. \nINT. ROOM.  DAY. \nLike Wilson's motel room, another version of a cell. \nA small window, high up.  Bricks and debris around the floor. And Wilson and Elaine.  Sitting, leaning against opposite stone walls. \nELAINE Tell me you wouldn't prefer a steady income. \nWilson takes a cigarette pack from a pocket.  Lights himself one.  Then tosses the stuff over to Elaine. \nWILSON I got a steady income -- I'm on the dole. \nELAINE (lights up) A leech on the welfare state in addition. You don't miss a trick. \nWILSON I fiddle it.  They got me down as an immigrant with five kids. \nElaine sort of shares a laugh at that. \nELAINE Yeah ... Jenny spoke fondly of her imaginary siblings. \nThough real ones might have been nice.  This an unspoken thought between them. \nELAINE (cont'd) Do you remember the last time you saw her? \nWILSON Last time might as well've been the first.  I remember all the times, don't I.  Watching her grow up -- (finding the word) in increments. \nELAINE She told me you were a ghost in her life. Daddy the friendly ghost.  Coming back to haunt her. \nWILSON Well, she twigged by the time she was eight or nine that daddy wasn't in the Royal Marines or doing scientific research in the jungles of Borneo or playing Iago in a worldwide tour of OTHELLO. \nELAINE Still, you could never ... do what she wanted. \nWilson shakes his head. \nWILSON She used to tell me she'd turn me in. (tries to laugh about it) Little kid.  Ten year old.  \"If you're naughty, Dad, I'll tell on ya.\"  She didn't want me sent down again, see. When I was planning some job.  \"I'll tell 'em, Dad, I promise I will.  Here, look, I'm calling the Old Bill right now\" -- picking up the telephone.  I can see her, the phone in her hand.  Became a sort of joke between us.  Only it wasn't a joke. \nELAINE She never would have turned you in, not in a million years. \nWILSON I know that.  But as time went on ... well, it wasn't a joke, was it?  She had a feeling about it -- about the last job -- how long I'd get the hook for.  Said she wouldn't be there this time when I got out. \nDOOR opens.  Thompson.  Gun in hand. \nCUT. \nINT. HALLWAY.  DAY. \nThompson leads Wilson past a row of windows.  Dockyards, harbor activity outside.  Toward a door with things stencilled on it.  One of them:  US DEPT. OF CUSTOMS. \nINT. OFFICE. \nA man named FEATHER.  Black.  Half sitting on the edge of a table.  Wilson is shown in. \nWilson at the door.  Sizes Feather up at a glance. \nWILSON This is where I come in. \nHe walks confidently in.  Outside, through the window, an image of a foreign sports car being hoisted in the air by a crane. \nThey're playing against a couple of other creeps. \nCREEP You broke last time. \nSTACY Let him break - he likes to break. \nCREEP Fuck you. \nSTACY I wouldn't talk. \nCREEP Huh? \nSTACY I saw your mother on the Strip last night.  She went up to three guys, said she'd like 'em to stick one in each, know what I mean? \nCreep rushes Stacy.  But doesn't get past Uncle John.  Who drops him with one punch.  Flooring him between two pool tables.  Stacy then goes over.  Supports himself with a hand on each table, swings his boot into the thug's face. \nBARTENDER (calls) Stacy. \nStacy looks.  Bartender holds up phone.  Stacy goes over. \nBARTENDER (cont'd) I can do without you inhibiting my business. \nStacy just scowls, takes the phone. \nSTACY (into phone) Yeah. \nUNCLE JOHN \nBreaks. \nSTACY \nHangs up.  Goes back to Uncle John.  Picks up his cue again. \nSTACY (cont'd) We've been fired. \nCUT. \nEXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  L.A.  DAY \nSomeone we've never seen before and will never see again stands in Valentine's driveway.  His name is FIELDING. \nA car comes up.  Another guy, GRAMMS, sits in it.  He waits. Eventually Fielding walks over. \nGRAMMS (re:  the burnt garage) Valentine had himself a party, I hear. \nFIELDING (by rote) My client has already given a statement regarding yesterday's events. \nGRAMMS A statement?  I wouldn't mind getting a statement.  You see, my client -- the United States Government -- would love to get a statement about a few of the deals going down with your client. \nFIELDING Deals?  My client is involved in any number of deals at any given moment. You'd have to be more specific. \nGRAMMS Your client have a deal in Long Beach? How about downtown?  There's some folks there -- oh, wait, they're all dead.  Any of this ring a bell? \nFIELDING My client is an entrepreneur.  I am his lawyer, not his business manager. \nGRAMMS So you wouldn't have any idea how your client continues to make so much fucking money. \nFIELDING He's always been very forward-thinking. He invested wisely. \nGRAMMS Where is he now? \nFIELDING He had urgent business in the north. \nGramms just laughs.  Just laughs and laughs.  And we leave him laughing.  And Fielding not. \nCUT. \nINT. RESTAURANT.  KITCHEN.  DAY. \nEd takes off an apron, heads out the door.  It's clear that he's not the head chef here -- because the HEAD CHEF, an Anglo, turns, wondering where he's going.  Over this we hear: \nWILSON (over) Where's Big Sur? \nELAINE (over) Up the coast. \nWILSON (over) How far? \nELAINE (over) I don't know -- few hours, I guess. \nWILSON (over) Fancy it? \nELAINE (over) I could use a vacation.  Of course, I keep forgetting, for you this is a vacation. \nSTACY You bet. \nUNCLE JOHN Like what. \nSTACY Like he'd never hire me for real.  Not week-to-week.  I don't have the credentials.  He thinks I'm just a sociopath, someone he can turn to when he needs \"plausible denial.\" \nUNCLE JOHN Well, we blew it, didn't we?  He ain't wrong. \nSTACY (savage mimicry) \"He ain't wrong.\"  Listen, I know this asshole who did just go to work for him. Full-time.  And this dickhead's parents just told me he took a road trip up the coast.  That's the type of individual gets hired, someone who'll shoot his mouth off to his family while on the job. \nUNCLE JOHN I don't get it. \nSTACY I don't know who that English guy is. Some kind of -- (finding the word) -- courier or something.  Maybe a seller. Maybe a buyer.  But Mr. Avery wanted him, those jigs wanted him -- and I betcha there's a briefcase somewhere. \nUNCLE JOHN What's in it? \nSTACY (shrugs) Drugs?  Cash?  Both if we're lucky. \nUNCLE JOHN How we gonna get that lucky? \nSTACY While they're all fucking each other over ... couple of parties like us could move right in. \nCUT. \nEXT. HIGHWAY.  DAY. \nWilson's car. \nCloser to Big Sur.  Scenery more magnificent. \nINT. WILSON'S CAR. \nEd still driving.  Wilson next to him.  Opening a new cigarette pack. \nED I've been wondering something. \nWILSON Again? \nED Do you have any friends, man? \nWILSON Yeah, I suppose.  Call 'em that, yeah. Down the boozer Saturday night.  Meet some of the lads. \nELAINE (a little more pointed) Friends and colleagues. \nWILSON You can't count on very many people, that's the trouble.  Number of times a decent job's been cocked up ... \nELAINE Poor baby. \nLittle back-seat sarcasm there.  Wilson looks kind of bitter. \nWILSON Useless gits.  I was gonna do the Post Office once. \nED What post office? \nWILSON The lot.  The whole British bloody Post Office.  I had a brilliant plan -- all worked out -- work of genius, it was. Could I get anybody interested?  No -- they're too busy pinching orange squash from the milkman.  Lazy sods.  Jumble sale on in Watford, they'll be up at the crack of dawn. \nELAINE You're just on a higher plane, Wilson. \nWILSON Too bleeding true, 'n' it. \nFlicks some cigarette pack paper out the window. \nEXT. HIGHWAY. \nThe car speeds along. \nCUT. \nEXT. HOUSE.  BIG SUR.  DAY. \nAn impressive clifftop dwelling.  Isolated on a winding road. On a beautiful promontory overlooking the sea.  Valentine RINGS the DOORBELL (actually CHIME).  It's opened by his ex- wife.  SUSAN.  Very well-maintained.  50-something. Surprised to see him.  But not overjoyed. \nVALENTINE Hello there. \nSUSAN What are you doing here? \nVALENTINE Exercising my visitation rights. \nSUSAN Since when? \nVALENTINE I miss my kids. \nSUSAN They're at college.  Or doesn't your accountant even tell you where the money goes anymore. \nEXT. DECK.  BIG SUR HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nAdhara sways in a hammock.  Staring at Valentine.  Wanting to know what the hell is going on. \nValentine stands smoking at the rail, looking out over the dark sea.  Ignoring Adhara.  Avery sits at a table. Bodyguards visible inside the house. \nVALENTINE (finally, to Avery) Do any of these guys cook? \nCUT. \nEXT. MOTEL PORCH.  EVENING. \nWilson at the car.  Elaine and Ed watching. \nEd has gathered that something has developed between Wilson and Elaine.  The way she's looking at Wilson. \nED ... Reminds me of Jennifer. \nELAINE (barely perceptible nod) Hard to miss. \nEd sighs.  Awkward. \nED I thought maybe you just came for the ride. \nELAINE I'd rather be with him than without him. I don't want to be found dead in L.A. \nWilson walks back to them.  Looking at Ed as if to say, ready to go?  At her as if to say ... maybe farewell. \nEXT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nTableau.  Evening has descended.  Surfaces glisten from a light drizzling rain. \nINT. VALENTINE HOUSE, BEDROOM.  NIGHT. \nAdhara, dressing.  Behind her, outside, way out of focus, a figure slithers by. \nINT. VALENTINE HOUSE, LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT. \nValentine and Avery sit watching TV (CELEBRITY REPORT!).  Tom is behind them in the kitchen, flipping through Marie Claire magazine. \nVALENTINE \nTurns to look through the sliding glass doors. \nHIS POV \nBeyond the deck stands Larry, his back to us, facing the ocean. \nEXT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  BACK YARD.  NIGHT. \nLooking toward the house, Larry in the foreground, facing us. He takes a bite from a cinnamon granola bar, then looks at it unhappily as he chews. \nLARRY Fuck. \nEXT. VALENTINE HOUSE, ANOTHER ANGLE.  NIGHT. \nLooking at the house from the top of the hill.  Rick stands in the driveway next to Valentine's car, smoking a cigarette. \nREVERSE ANGLE \nWilson and Ed watching him.  Wilson nods his head to the left, and Ed moves in that direction.  Wilson moves quietly off to the right. \nINT. VALENTINE HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT. \nValentine and Avery, still watching TV. \nVALENTINE (re:  the channel) Check the news. \nAvery starts looking around. \nAVERY Where's the remote? \nSuddenly, we hear a CAR ALARM.  Tom looks up from his magazine.  Valentine looks to Avery, who shakes his head: It's nothing. \nEXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  DRIVEWAY.  NIGHT. \nRick turns and looks up the driveway toward the sound.  He puts his cigarette out. \nEXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK YARD.  NIGHT. \nLarry has turned toward the sound as well.  Through a partially obscured side entrance, he sees Rick walking up the driveway. \nEXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  DRIVEWAY.  NIGHT. \nADHARA (scared) What's going on? \nAvery and Tom have drawn their guns. \nVALENTINE We think someone is here. \nADHARA We think? \nVALENTINE We can't find ... (what are their names?) ... two of our guys. \nTOM (fucking typical) Larry and Rick. \nADHARA Did somebody call the cops? \nTom snorts.  Avery looks at Valentine:  Haven't you told this girl anything? \nVALENTINE No. \nADHARA Why not? \nVALENTINE Because -- \nAVERY Because I'm taking care of it. \nADHARA You guys are fucking nuts, I'm calling -- \nShe starts to stand.  Valentine pulls her down. \nADHARA Hey. \nTOM Mr. Avery. \nAvery looks to Tom, who nods toward the back porch. \nTHEIR POV \nA silhouetted figure is tentatively making its way along the porch, trying not to be seen.  We don't get a very clear glimpse. \nAVERY \nDraws his gun and takes aim. \nTHE FIGURE \nCareful not to become fully visible, but growing more courageous with each step. \nAVERY \nLocked on him, waiting. \nVALENTINE \nPuts Adhara's hand to her ears. \nTHE FIGURE \nWe see a little more now than we have before. \nAVERY \nHe sees enough.  Squeezes off a series of SHOTS, the muzzle flash strobing the kitchen area like a flashbulb, Adhara and Valentine flinching. \nTHE FIGURE \nHit.  Spinning and collapsing to the ground. \nAVERY \nLowers his gun.  Turns to Tom. \nAVERY Watch my back. \nAvery moves out from behind the counter and heads for the body. \nEXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT. \nAvery makes his way to the figure, which is on its stomach and writhing slightly. \nAVERY \nCareful.  Takes the gun and turns the body over. \nSTACY \nScreams again as his elbow of his gun hand disintegrates.  He slips on the first step and tumbles down, the gun bouncing beside him. \nUNCLE JOHN \nSees this.  Stands up to cross the back porch.  Takes a step forward but is stopped by a bullet in the chest (about the only clean shot anybody makes).  He looks down at himself. \nUNCLE JOHN Shit. \nHe looks up to SEE: \nAVERY \nNear death.  Gun in his good hand.  He squeezes the trigger again. \nUNCLE JOHN \nA small black hole appears in his cheek.  He blinks, begins to raise his hand to his face, and collapses. \nAVERY \nExhales and rolls over. \nTOM \nStill trying to get to his feet.  He gives up and just lies there, panting. \nA HAND \nReaches for the gun beside Tom.  Tilt up with it to reveal: \nED \nHe puts the gun in his jacket and slides away. \nINT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT. \nValentine and Adhara are still stuck behind the counter. Valentine sees the shadowy shape of Ed slipping behind the back porch. \nVALENTINE \nDecides to make a run for it, following Tom's route, away from Ed. \nADHARA Where are you going? \nLIVING ROOM \nValentine runs to the sliding door, smack into: \nWILSON \nStanding there.  Wet.  Mad.  He grabs Valentine by the shirt and pushes him back into the room. \nVALENTINE \nBounces off the couch and onto the floor. \nWILSON \nComes toward him. \nVALENTINE \nGrabs a lamp off an end table and hurls it at Wilson.  It careens off Wilson's arm and shatters. \nWILSON \nIs almost on him now. \nVALENTINE \nTries to scramble away.  Throwing anything he can get his hands on at. \nWILSON \nWho keeps coming.  He grabs Valentine, pulls him up, then throws him into the television. \nVALENTINE \nCrashes into the TV face first and bounces to the floor. \nWILSON \nGoes to him, grabs him by the neck with one hand and pulls out his gun with the other.  He seems about to speak when suddenly he screams instead. \nOut of bullets now.  Gun CLICKING crazily on empty.  He simply drops it. \nWILSON \nNow stands before him. \nTHE TWO OF THEM \nBoth breathing hard. \nWILSON Tell me. \nThis is not what Valentine expected. \nVALENTINE What. \nWILSON Tell me. \nVALENTINE Tell you ... \nWILSON About Jenny. (closer) Tell me about Jenny. (closer) About the deal.  Whatever fucking deal you had to kill my daughter for when she found out about it, you bastard. \nWilson drops to the ground too, in a passionate fury, starts strangling Valentine. \nWILSON Tell me.  Tell me about it, you fucking bastard. \nEasing up just enough for Valentine to sputter out a response. \nVALENTINE She could've had the deal!  I would've handed it to her if she wanted.  I would have given her everything. \nWILSON Why then.  Why did you do it! \nThey're locked in a kind of embrace.  Sprayed by the waves crashing into the rocks.  Sweating and gasping and exhausted and hurt and furious. \nVALENTINE She didn't want to share it, she wanted to stop it.  To stop me.  She said she'd turn me in. \nWILSON \nShock of recognition on his face.  At those words. \nVALENTINE She said, \"You go ahead with this, I'll turn you in, Terry.\" \nWilson sits back.  Panting.  Totally spent.  The two of them. Both on the ground now.  Whatever energy they had left drained -- Valentine from his confession, Wilson from hearing it. Valentine shaking, sobbing.  Still not realizing the pathetic folly of his actions. \nVALENTINE She was serious.  She would have done it. She had the phone in her hand.  She was going to do it. \nWILSON \nKnows that the girl he loved ... loved Valentine, too.  Having heard the truth, the last vestige of revenge has vanished. He gets up and walks away.  Leaving the quivering shell of Valentine behind. \nCUT. \nINT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  LIVING ROOM.  NIGHT. \nAdhara wakes up.  Hand to her smashed cheek and mouth.  But it's not her hand.  It's Valentine's.  She sort of shuffles away from him along the floor.  Sits against a wall holding her face.  Valentine sits back against an opposite wall. They stare at each other. \nCUT. \nINT. PLANE.  DAY. \nWilson, lost in thought.  Accepts a drink from a FLIGHT ATTENDANT.  We can see it pains him to reach for it. \nWILSON Ta. \nAfter setting the glass down, his other hand goes to the shoulder where his stab wound was no doubt only temporarily dealt with. \nFLASH CUTS: \nWILSON. At the roadside hotel, grimacing. \nELAINE. Cleaning his wound. \nWilson rubs his shoulder.  The AMERICAN LADY in the seat beside him heard the way he said thanks to the Flight Attendant. \nLADY You're English. \nA small beat (which he takes each time he responds). \nWILSON Yeah, that's right. \nLADY I can never decide what I like better. Leaving home, or coming back. \nWILSON \n", "test1_input": "\"The Limey,\" production draft, by Lem Dobbs \nTHE LIMEY \nby \nLEM DOBBS \ndraft 08/03/98 \nNOTE:  THE HARD COPY OF THIS SCRIPT CONTAINED SCENE NUMBERS. THEY HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THIS SOFT COPY. \nWilson's first impression of Los Angeles was blue.  He was in the sky at the time, so it was a curious reversal, looking down rather than up at the color he had always felt was nature's finest. \nSwimming pools.  Hundreds of them.  Pockmarking the landscape like miniature lakes.  A flat landscape of straight streets and square blocks and sparse grass that didn't look quite green enough. \nAs far as Wilson could remember, he had only ever seen seven or eight swimming pools in his entire life and they had been public ones.  Here everyone had their own.  Marvellous. \nThere was the one at the Butlin's holiday camp where he had enjoyed his last legitimate employment -- as driver of a tour bus.  And there was the one at Crystal Palace he had gone to once or twice when he was younger.  He was most familiar, though, with the Chelsea Baths as he had lived for some time in a flat nearby in what he now thought of as his good years -- before he'd gone grey, went to prison, and found himself in a plane over a foreign town arriving to avenge the death of his daughter. \nWHOOSH!  The sound of automatic doors opening and -- \nEXT. ARRIVALS TERMINAL.  L.A. AIRPORT.  AFTERNOON. \nWILSON steps out into the late sunlight and the heat of the day.  A slow-motion moment while he gets acclimatized.  He wouldn't have ever felt quite this kind of heat before. After such a rigorously air-conditioned interior.  Or seen cops wearing guns on their belts.  Or black cops, for that matter, with guns on their belts.  Or seen people as fat as Americans on their home turf.  Things someone from England notices immediately, whether consciously at first or not. \nCUT. \nEXT. MOTEL.  EVENING. \nWilson's not here for comfort.  Shown to a shitty room, round the corner of a typical 2nd-level outside walkway.  Airport close by. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM.  EVENING. \nHe draws a curtain open across a window in one strong easy glide.  His moves are neat.  His expressions just as economical, not giving much away.  Outside the planes are practically on top of us. The sunset colors strange and chemical. \nHe's only got one light bag.  Unzips, unpacks a few things. Change of clothes, a travel kit, and some familiar items (shaving foam/toothpaste/deodorant} bearing unfamiliar British brand names. \nGoes into the bathroom.  Turns on the shower in there. \nComes back to sit on the bed.  Takes an envelope out of his jacket. \nENVELOPE \nTurns it over to see the return address on the back. \nCUT. \nINT. TAXI.  NIGHT. \nWilson in the back.  Stares at the impenetrable name on the driver's posted ID. Glances at the driver. \nDRIVER glances back at his quiet passenger in the rearview mirror. \nCUT. \nEXT. SMALL HOUSE.  NIGHT. \nWilson walks up a cracked little path to the front door. Lower middle-class street.  Two cars in the driveway, one behind the other.  Lights on inside the house -- as he rings the bell. \nED RAMA \nAnswers it.  Hispanic.  Late 30's.  Chairman Mao on his T- shirt notwithstanding, an easygoing sort of fellow.  Not looking for any trouble -- anymore.  But once did, and able to handle himself if any shows up.  Which it has. \nWILSON Edward Rama? \nED Eduardo. (rolling the R) Rama. \nWILSON You're home, then. \nHe turns, waves away the taxi he's kept waiting.  While Eduardo Rama waits for an introduction. \nWILSON My name's Wilson. \nAccent speaks for itself.  Hard, working-class. \nED Wilson? \nKnows the name.  But just now it's unexpected.  He's holding a hot TV dinner, hand protected by a dish towel. \nWILSON You wrote to me about my daughter. \nCUT. \n", "test1_true": "Ed takes Wilson inside. \nED I didn't expect anyone. \nWILSON No reason. \nED I mean, what has it been -- six months? \nWILSON Round about, yeah. \nThey've entered a cauldron of family life.  TV blaring (SHOWBIZ TONIGHT!).  A couple of younger KIDS yelling \"Mama\". Their MOTHER shouting back at them from the kitchen (in Spanish) that she only has two hands.  A sullen TEENAGER walking by. \nED I didn't even know who I was writing to -- just someone with the same last name. She never talked about any family. \nWILSON It was better than a telegram. \nEd opens a screen door to the backyard. \nEXT. ED'S BACKYARD.  NIGHT. \nThey sit at an outdoor table.  Wilson with a TV dinner in front of him now too.  Sounds from inside MUTED.  Even this little house has a little pool. \nWILSON Who done it, then? \nED Huh? \nWILSON Snuffed her. \nEd surprised at Wilson's directness.  Ed stands nervously. \nED Now, wait up a second, man. \nAnd paces back and forth. \nED I never said nothin' about nothin' like that.  No, no, no.  That's not what I wrote to you. \nWILSON No, but between the lines, eh? Mysterious circumstances, and that. \nEd stops pacing. \nED Look, I sent you that newspaper clipping, all right?  I told you what I know.  It was an accident.  I didn't say anything about anybody being \"snuffed.\" \nBeat. \nWILSON This bloke she was bunked up with.  This Terry what'sit. \nED Terry Valentine. \nWILSON Valentine.  What's he got to say for himself? \nED I dunno.  What's he gonna say?  They had a fight that night, she drove away, she was upset?  I don't even know the guy. Don't get me wrong, Jenny and me were friends, but we didn't travel in the same social circles.  She had her life, I had mine. \nMakes a kind of scoffing gesture:  and you can see what my life is. \nED Valentine came into the restaurant where I work with Jenny a couple times.  He's a money guy.  Jenny would say, hey, here's my friend Eddie and he would shake my hand and everything, but he wouldn't even see me, you know what I mean. \nWilson gazes up at the sky.  Clear night.  Stars. \nWILSON How long had she been in the States? (as if to himself, somewhat wistful) Near on ten years, wasn't it?  Long enough to know her way about, I reckon. \nEd leans down, palms on the tabletop, facing Wilson. \nED There was an investigation, okay?  The car was totalled.  Jennifer was ... Her neck was broken.  On impact, they said. So she wouldn't have ... felt the effects of the fire. (helpless shrug) It happens up there.  Happens a lot. What more can I tell you. \nWilson taps out a cigarette from a pack of \"Silk Cut\" he's produced from his pocket. \nWILSON What more is there. \nED I'm just sayin' -- it was a steep hillside.  There was no moon that night ... \nWilson's quiet stillness is getting to him. \nED Coulda happened to anyone, man.  I never knew her to be reckless.  I mean, sure, she would smoke a little grass, or something, have a few drinks.  But that's it, nothing more than that. \nWILSON No, not my girl.  Self-control, she had. Point of pride. (smokes) And people don't change, do they. \nED I dunno ... Maybe they do. \nWilson notes the tattoos on Ed's forearms. \nWILSON Going straight, are ya. \nEd looks at him.  Sits down again.  Keeping his forearms under the table. \n", "test1_id": 2478, "test2_input": "ED (looks away) Boomerang. \nWILSON Y'what? \nED I knew when I was droppin' that letter into the mail slot it was gonna come back and smack me in the face.

I don't need a wife and screamin' kids.  I still got my youth. \nAnd yet -- he lives here.  Wilson declines to pursue the matter. \nED I go to work, try to keep my life together, put all that shit behind me, man.  What d'you want from me. \nWILSON (calmly smoking) I only asked. \nEd sighs.  Reaches for one of Wilson's cigarettes. \nED Couple weeks before she died, Jennifer asked me to drive her downtown.  Said she was meeting -- her boyfriend -- Valentine.  But I think she was looking for him. \nFLASH CUTS: \nED AND JENNIFER. In a car, downtown. She has the same steely intensity as her father. Ed looks a little worried. \nWILSON (lighting Ed's cigarette) What, tryin' to catch him with another bird? \nED That's what I thought, man.  But it was not a hotel or nothin' that we went to. It was someplace else. \nWILSON Where abouts? \nFLASH CUTS: \nJENNIFER. Talking to a beefy SUPERVISOR. Or talking at him. Either way, he isn't happy. \nMEAT PUPPETS. Watch instead of working. \nED. Taking all this in. \nED Bad place, man.  Bad people.  Some guys loading some trucks.  Some kinda deal goin' down. (anticipating Wilson's next question) I don't know and I don't care.  Maybe they're shipping fava beans to Eskimos. \nWILSON Did Jenny know? \nED (shrugs) Valentine wasn't even there.  If he was into something, if she was involved -- who can say. (stands up again) But I'll tell you something.  She stood in front of these dudes, man.  Eyeballing them.  Checking them out. (beat) I felt like she was covering my ass that day. \nUnconsciously rubbing his arms where his tattoos are. \nED I drove her back to Valentine's house. \nFLASH CUT: \nVALENTINE. Standing in front of his house. His expression says: We have something to discuss. \nED He was standing outside waiting for her. That's the only other time I ever saw him. (a short sad note) Last time I saw her. \nHe meets Wilson's gaze.  As hard and pointed as a drill through his skull. \nCUT. \nINT. ED'S CAR.  NIGHT. \nEd drives Wilson back to his motel.  Wilson silent.  Ed still not quite sure who he's dealing with.  Is this really or merely a grieving dad? \nED What you gonna do, man?  You gonna go to the cops? \nWILSON Nah, coppers don't do nothing, do they. \nED Those streets up in the hills, man. Gotta be real careful, keep your eye on the ball.  Two o'clock in the morning, it's dark, your mind is all agitated, you're drivin' a little too fast ... (beat) Those curves don't kid around. \nCould be talking about the girl.  Wilson doesn't move.  But touch him, he'll explode.  Out the window lights are passing, but no landmarks.  He might as well be on the moon. \nED You should talk to Elaine.  That was her best friend. \nWILSON She didn't write to me, did she. \nED She didn't know what to say. (shrugs) I thought someone should say something. To someone.  With me it was, I don't know -- Jenny liked me for some reason.  I felt like I owed her. \nWILSON Who'd Jenny get it off of -- this grass or whatever? \nED (self-conscious again) Not me, man.  I'm no drug dealer, what you think. \nWILSON (re Ed's tattoos) I think you didn't get that lot in the Navy, doing your National Service. \nED I already told you, man.  Corcoran.  Know what that is?  State prison. \n", "test2_true": "ED But that's not me anymore.  That's when I was into the gang lifestyle.  That's not who I am now.  Five years in the joint -- that's it for me, man. \nNow Wilson drops the clanger. \nWILSON Just got out meself, didn't I. \nAnd Ed turns.  Looks at Wilson.  Fellow ex-con. \nCUT. \nEXT. WILSON'S MOTEL.  NIGHT. \nWilson out of the car, shuts the passenger door.  Ed on the other side, looks over the roof at him. \nED Go home, man. (plane taking off in background) Get on a plane. \nWilson has other plans. \nWILSON I'll be needing a shooter. \nMakes his fingers like a gun.  And a clicking sound. \nED (comes quickly over) You're kiddin' me, right? \nWILSON What do I do, then, look in the bleedin' Yellow Pages? \nED (an urgent whisper) These are not guys you can just go run a number on, man. \nWILSON (looking around) Thought perhaps there'd be dispensing machines, you know.  Bung in your coins, come out with a .44 Magnum, fully-loaded. \nEd throws up his hands, walks back to his driver's side door. \nED Are you a resident of California? You gonna fill out forms, man?  Do the background check?  Go through a three-day waiting period? \nWILSON Sod that.  Gotta get back before my probation officer wonders where I've skived off to. \nED Probation?  Man, you crazy.  They shouldn't've let you outta your country, much less prison. \nWILSON Travelling on a dodgy passport, n' all. \nWalks round to come face to face with Ed once more. \nWILSON Which is why I thought, save some time, get what I need under the table, like. \nED \nAs if resigned and mulling the problem over: \nED Under the table? \nCUT. \nINT. GUN SHOW.  DAY. \nHundreds of tables.  Under bright lights.  Displaying every kind of firearm.  Handguns, rifles, shotguns, parts to make machine guns.  A weapons bazaar. \nWILSON AND ED \nWalking around.  Even a cool customer like Wilson can't help but be impressed by America's loving embrace of senseless mayhem. \nDEALERS \nTouting their wares. \nVISITORS \nTrying out pistol grips -- or pushing baby carriages.  Guys in fatigue jackets with toddlers on their shoulders.  Women in stretch pants looking for a little something in personal protection. \nWILSON \nDoesn't know where to look.  At the booth featuring \"Classic Cowboy Collectibles\" -- or the most OBESE COUPLE he's ever seen who just walked by. \nPA SYSTEM Attention:  the long-range vermin- shooting panel is due to commence in two minutes in the blue room at the rear of the Convention Center. \n... and other anomalous oddball ANNOUNCEMENTS in the background as long as we're here. \nDEMONSTRATION \nAt a booth selling laser attachments. \nBEAM SALESMAN BeamSight II is easily mountable on any shotgun, rifle, or sidearm and will project a small, bright red dot directly onto the point where your weapon is aimed ... \nFor purposes of display, a smiling YOUNG WOMAN is the \"target.\" \n", "test2_id": 2479, "test3_input": "GUY That's too bad.  Ian's got a good thing going over there. \nWILSON Yeah? \nGUY Turned that place completely around.  180 degrees. \nWILSON No kidding. \nGUY What I like about Ian, he believes in a chain of command, but not a chain of respect, you understand what I'm saying? \nWILSON Right.  Chain of respect.  That's good, that. \nGUY Yeah.  I really admire the guy.  Well. Good to meet you. \nWILSON Yeah.  Cheers, mate. \nThe Guy leaves.  Wilson sees that Adhara is now on the other side of the room, separated from Valentine.  He heads for her. \nVALENTINE \nStill dealing with people desperate to be the focus of his attention.  He notices: \nWILSON AND ADHARA \nTalking in a corner.  She seems attentive. \nVALENTINE \nIn a SERIES OF CUTS, still being the gracious host, still keeping his eyes on: \nWILSON AND ADHARA \nWho, in a SERIES OF CUTS, continue to talk.  Finally, they separate, Wilson heading outside onto a deck. \nVALENTINE \nExcuses himself from a group of sycophants and goes to her. \nADHARA \nValentine approaches and begins talking to her, low.  After a few moments of conversation, they both look toward: \nWILSON \nOn the deck outside.  Joining Ed, who's taken refuge out here with a plate of food.  What Wilson can't belleve when he SEES it -- is that behind Valentine's house, which is on top of a high hill, is nothing but desolate scrub canyon.  On the other side of the railing around the deck, which is surely less than regulation height, is a sheer drop into an abyss. \nWILSON (cont'd) (jumps back with only slightly affected vertigo) Flipping heck. \nEd, a little more accustomed to L.A. architecture, nods in agreement. \nED If you could afford a house like this you would buy a house like this. \nWilson edges forward to the rail again. \nWILSON What are we standing on? \nED Faith. \nThey stand there looking out.  Quite a view once you get used to it.  Breeze. \nED (cont'd) (nods to the hazy distance) You could see the sea from here if you could see it. \nWILSON Could you? \nBut now Ed gives Wilson a nudge -- SEEING that Valentine inside the house is making his way out here. \nWILSON Why don't you go nick one of those little cooker what's its warming up the sausages cocktail and meet me in the garage.  Look about for a toolbox while you're at it. \nEd considers.  His is not to reason why. \nED Okay. \nEd moves off.  Valentine steps up, smile fully loaded. \nVALENTINE Hi.  Terry Valentine. \nHe extends his hand.  Wilson shakes it. \nWILSON Pleasure. \nVALENTINE Have we met?  There's something I can't quite -- \nWILSON EMI in London.  I work with Ian. \n", "test3_true": "WILSON You must know Ian. \nVALENTINE I don't. \nWILSON Great bloke.  Really turned things around there.  180 degrees. \nVALENTINE I suppose that's good, unless things were fine the way they were. \nWILSON Oh, I think a shake-up was in order. Definitely.  Otherwise, people get lazy, don't they?  Forgetful.  Start thinking they can get away with things.  Gotta shake 'em up now and again, make 'em pay attention. \nWilson looks at him.  Valentine looks back.  Something about those eyes ... \nEXCITED GUY Terry, Terry ... \nThe Excited Guy appears, tugging at Valentine. \nWILSON Glad I got to meet you. \nEXCITED GUY Ter ... Ter ... you gotta ... \nVALENTINE Thanks.  You, too. \nWILSON Be seein' you. \nThe Excited Guy ushers Valentine away.  Wilson watches him go. \nEXCITED GUY Charles Grodin is here. \nCUT. \nINT. VALENTINE'S GARAGE.  AFTERNOON. \nEd, waiting.  Wilson enters. \nWILSON Got it? \nEd displays the Sterno. \nWILSON Toolbox? \nEd points to a table, where a toolbox sits.  Wilson crosses to it, begins going through the contents. \nWILSON Put the Sterno on the ground, near the center of the garage. \nEd does.  Wilson pulls a brace-and-bit from the toolbox and crosses to the rear of one of the cars.  Dropping to the ground, he bores a hole in the gas tank.  Ed raises his eyebrows and moves toward the door.  Wilson crosses to the other car and puts a hole in that gas tank as well.  Then he puts the brace-and-bit back in the toolbox and heads for the exit, Ed right behind him, giving a quick backward glance. \nTHE GASOLINE \nSpills out, slowly but steadily, and slithers toward the garage door. \nEXT. BETWEEN VALENTINE'S HOUSE AND GARAGE.  AFTERNOON. \nWilson and Ed walk briskly along the path. \nWILSON (gives Ed parking ticket) Bring the motor around.  Bang out in front, right? \nED You goin' back inside? \nWILSON One thing I need. \nINT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS.  AFTERNOON. \nValentine is talking to Gordon, his beefy bodyguard, and looking around.  He stops as he sees Wilson once again stepping onto the deck.  He points Wilson out to Gordon, who nods and heads for the deck. \nEXT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  AFTERNOON. \nEd hands the ticket to a Valet.  He exchanges looks with a couple of the other Valets. \nINT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE.  DOWNSTAIRS.  AFTERNOON. \nValentine is talking to Adhara, who is introducing her Girlfriend.  As Valentine greets her, he glances outside where Gordon is approaching Wilson on the deck. \nEXT. DECK. \nWilson SEES Gordon approaching.  Gets ready to greet him. Removes cigarette from mouth, drops it to floor of deck, presses it out under his shoe.  Limbers up his shoulders in a subtle way. \nGordon coming towards him.  As if to challenge Wilson's legitimacy as an invited guest.  Closer.  About to speak. \nBut Wilson doesn't even give him a chance to do that.  In quick succession:  Wilson HEAD BUTTS Gordon, splintering his nose; KNEES him in the groin; then, using the knee for leverage, grabs Gordon by the lapels -- and heaves him over the railing! \nIt happened so fast that if anyone else is nearby they probably didn't even notice -- or didn't readily grasp what they saw. \nINT. VALENTINE'S HOUSE. \n", "test3_id": 2480}

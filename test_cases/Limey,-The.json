{"test1_input": "WILSON \nWalking past, almost subliminally noting the Young Woman with the symbol of death on her. \nTABLE \nA .45 passed from a DEALER's hand to Wilson's. \nDEALER Man knows what he likes. \nED (he'll talk if Wilson won't) Lookin' good. \nDEALER (while Wilson checks) That's a high-end item.  Total reliability. \nED What'd you call that -- the Protector? \nDEALER Yes, sir.  Won't find a better CQC on the market. \nWilson's eyes glance up -- but Ed asks the question. \nED CQ what? \nDEALER Close Quarters Combat.  Keep one in my own home. \nWILSON Trouble is, I'm not at home, see. Fancied a bit of target shooting, y'know, while I'm here -- with me mate. \nNods at Ed. \nDEALER Oh really?  Where you from? \nWILSON England. (sighting the weapon) Only, we saw there was a show on, thought I might pick something up for a price, type of thing. \nDEALER You came to the right place, sir.  My wife's second cousin is English.  Well, Scotch-Irish.  Can I interest you in a holster? \nWILSON Just luck, this, really.  Never been to one of these before. \nDEALER You're in gun country now, my friend. \nWILSON (picks up another, checks it out) Been to the Boat Show. \nDEALER (re Wilson's new selection) Packs a punch, but it's compact, has accessible features -- makes a nice concealed-carry piece. \nED (playing the reluctant buyer) He don't have a concealed weapons permit. \nWILSON Don't have time for a lot of paperwork, y'know.  Just popped over on a quick visit. \nDEALER I can take care of the paperwork. \nWILSON Yeah? \nDEALER No problem.  If you don't have a problem with me reporting this gun stolen. \nA look of understanding between them. \nWILSON No.  Not at all. (to Ed) Do we? \nED Not me, man. \nWILSON I mean, it's already a steal, n'it -- what you said -- four hundred for this one? \nDEALERS Well, I'll have to add another two hundred on top of that. \nWILSON Oh, aye? \nDEALER (another look) ... for the paperwork. \nCUT. \nINT. ED'S CAR.  DAY. \nEd drives.  Nervous at Wilson handling his new gun purchase beside him. \nWILSON Violation of my parole, this. (a perfect pause) -- Goin' abroad. \nEd shakes his head at Wilson's sense of humor. \nED You hadda show up on a weekend.  This weekend.  Wouldn't've even been a gun show ... for another month. \nWILSON Fucking out of order, that.  Shouldn't be allowed. \nAs he puts away a box of ammo. \nED Now what.  You gonna take your new arsenal, go visit Terry Valentine, just like that?  Boom bam boom. \n", "test1_true": "ED Five years, I think.  Long time. \nWILSON Well, there you are.  Jen must've liked him. \nDoesn't make Ed feel any better.  Nor does the way Wilson seems now to be studying Ed's driving techniques.  Paying attention to the way traffic lights and left-turn lanes and cars without clutches work over here. \nED (remembering) Jenny told me she met him at the beach. Got blinded by his smile. (beat) You believe that shit?  Son of a bitch never smiled at me.  Buried her at a \"private\" service.  Private for who. Him? \nWILSON (confused) Hang about.  I thought you said he come into the restaurant where you worked with Jenny. \nED He came in with Jenny to the restaurant where I work.  That's not where they met. \nWILSON And that's where you met Jenny. \nED No, no -- Jenny used to work as a waitress.  Before she met him.  But that's not where she met me.  Not in my restaurant. \nWILSON How'd the two of you hook up, then? \nED Oh, Jenny was in my acting class. \nCUT. \nINT. RENTAL CAR.  DAY. \nWilson at the wheel himself.  Getting the hang of L.A. Driving downtown.  Along one of the major boulevards. \nGlances at a street sign as he goes by.  Picks up the map book on the seat beside him to check his route. \nEXT. BOULEVARD.  DAY. \nWilson makes a sudden lane change to avoid getting fed in the wrong direction.  Gets HONKED by another driver. \nEXT. A STREET DOWNTOWN.  DAY. \nWilson cruises past a particular building.  We don't have to really clearly see it just yet (we saw it in the flash cuts) -- more important we see him seeing it.  Casing it with the eyes of a professional.  Sniffing it out; the instinct of a predator after prey. \nINT. CAR.  DAY. \nParks it.  Produces the little leather travel kit we saw him unpack at his motel.  Unzips it.  Under the usual assortment of clippers, razors, etc., is a hidden layer -- storing still more personalized items:  a set of select slim lockpicking/cutting tools. \nEXT. SIDE STREET.  DAY. \nWilson locks the car.  Walks away.  STAY with him. \nAROUND THE CORNER \nHe walks down the block.  A nice long walk.  What we get out of it besides a sense of Wilson -- cool cat; ambling along; loner; sun beating down; not bothered; his shadow doubling him -- is this: \nThe building approaching.  The one he has his eye on.  The target.  It's across the street.  A kind of flat windowless warehouse with adjoining loading yard.  Loading yard surrounded by a chain-link fence -- topped with barbed wire. \nThe actual geography of where he left his car in relation to this building.  Safely around the corner.  And how he might practically get back to it, either this same way or via a more circuitous route round another block. \nThe sense you get in downtown L.A. on a lazy Saturday afternoon that you're in a ghost town.  Particularly in this shabby kind of industrial section. \nEXT. THE BUILDING. \nWilson crosses over to it now.  From sunny to shade. \nWalks past the chain-link fence.  The padlocked gate, big enough to accommodate the (couple of) trucks parked within the compound. \nWalks past the closed security door which would appear to be the building's main entrance. \nRound the next corner -- SEES there's a steel back door as well. \nComes around this block again.  Looking surreptitiously around now.  Streets here utterly deserted.  Not even a passing car. Crappy residential building on an opposite corner, SPANISH MUSIC blaring from one of the open windows, but not with a direct view on the loading yard fence on this side.  Wilson nearing it now -- taking something out of his pocket.  One of the mysterious metallic tools from his travel kit.  Snaps his wrist, unfolding the tool with a CRACK.  Wire cutters. \nHe doesn't go for the gate, the padlock, like we might have thought.  He suddenly drops to one knee, in shadow where the fence meets the adjoining building.  SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP, SNAP -- so quick, with great dexterity, though his face grimaces with the strength he has to exert with each application of pressure -- he cuts just as many links as he knows he needs to push in a little flap of fence and roll under.  Whole thing accomplished in seconds. \nLOADING YARD \nWalks fast to the cover of the trucks.  Passes.  Looks around.  Cement loading docks and bays.  Shuttered doors.  He jumps up to one, puts his ear to the metal.  Listens awhile. \nWILSON \nScans the wall for any sign of an alarm box or anything. Then cocks an ear upwards... CAMERA CRANING UP to show us what he hears:  an air-conditioning unit HUMMING away.  Which means someone must be inside. \nWilson looks back at his entry options.  Not the loading doors -- but a conventional door at one end, with a conventional lock his eye zeroes in on.  Gets out his tools, going over. \nINT. WAREHOUSE HALLWAY. \nA SCRATCHING at the door.  It opens.  He's in. \nWaits.  Cautious.  Nothing.  He starts along the hallway. \n", "test1_id": 2478, "test2_input": "STACY (as a fat jogger passes) Good luck. \nSTACY (watching someone else go by) Jesus, are you gay enough or what. \nSTACY (barely out of earshot of a black woman with dyed blonde hair) Very attractive.  Good idea.  Now I really want to fuck you. \nSTACY (after a long time in silence, just staring at someone) ... you can always tell the ones who'll do anal. \nSTACY (regarding some other beachgoers) Kinda makes you wonder why more people don't put a bullet through their fuckin' skulls, doesn't it. \nSTACY (reading a newspaper) Looks like they just airbrushed the dick out of his mouth. \nSTACY (leaning back on his elbows) Why don't they have TV shows about people whose daily lives you'd be interested in watching.  Y'know.  Like SKINNY LITTLE WEAKLING.  Or BIG FAT GUY.  SICK OLD MAN. FAMILY OF LOSERS.  Wouldn't that be good? \nSTACY (sitting up) Two blacks and a Mexican in a car.  Who's driving? \nUNCLE JOHN I don't know. \nSTACY The L.A.P.D. \nSTACY (observing a \"fast-walker\") Oh yeah, keep doing that.  That's really healthy. \nSTACY (his gaze following another unfortunate) Can't you do something about your ass? \nSTACY (his head turning after someone else) Other people's lives scare the shit out of me. \nSTACY (watching some guy rooting in a trash bin) \"Homeless\" people.  Fuck them.  Remember when they were just bums?  Everyone with an axe to grind.  Like to grind in their face.  Pretty soon there'll be shit-in- your-pants rights groups.  Stupidity activists. \nSTACY (glad he's who he is and not who he's looking at) Wonder what it's like being a dumb guy in a dumb suit trying to cross the street. \nSTACY (staring at another sad couple) Life sure is a minefield. \nSTACY (clocking another female) Look at that one.  She's really been used. \nSTACY (in a contemplative mode) I'd love to be famous so I could snub ordinary people.  Imagine, you're famous, you're sitting in a restaurant, some fool comes up to you, wants you to sign your name on his napkin, his wife is there, it would be something these poor saps would cherish the rest of their lives, talk about to their cretin friends.  Bam!  You tell 'em to FUCK OFF!  God, I'd love that. \nSuddenly Uncle John speaks. \nUNCLE JOHN Is that her?  I bet that's her. \nStacy turns. \nPOV \nAcross the street, Elaine comes out of her building.  (We're supposing this is an apartment building somewhat worth living in that has outdoor parking of some kind, visible from the street, or only street parking.) \nCUT. \nEXT. SOME STREET.  DAY. \nElaine's car on the move.  Stacy and Uncle John in a car following. \nINT. ELAINE'S CAR. \nGoing somewhere.  Unaware of the creeps in her wake. \nINT. STACY/UNCLE JOHN'S CAR. \nAn \"8x10\" of Elaine on their back seat.  Another picture of her on a page torn from a \"Player's Directory.\" \nUNCLE JOHN Maybe she doesn't even know the English guy. \nSTACY (driving) Avery said she was tight with his daughter. \nUNCLE JOHN That don't mean nothin'. \nStacy knows better than to argue with a moron. \nUNCLE JOHN She's nice lookin'. \nSTACY So what. \nUNCLE JOHN I dunno.  I just said she's nice lookin'. \nSTACY And I said so what.  You think she's any happier? \nUNCLE JOHN What d'you mean, any happier? \nSTACY Any happier than any other asshole in life. \nPause. \nUNCLE JOHN I dunno.  I never met her. \n", "test2_true": "INT. SOUND STUDIO.  DAY. \nOn screen:  A BEAUTIFUL MODEL -- but speaking in ELAINE'S VOICE. \nELAINE \nAt a mic.  Wearing headphones.  Matching her voice to the model's lip movements.  Looping this commercial or whatever it is. \nINT. HALLWAY. \nWilson.  Comes to a window where he can see Elaine inside in the sound-proofed studio. \nCUT. \nINT. SOUND STUDIO.  DAY. \nWilson and Elaine talk while technicians change reels. \nELAINE -- they want Southern, I do Southern, they want Midwest, I do Midwest, they want tall, blonde, and twenty-two, I'm shit out of luck. (pauses) One thing I can't do is English. Americans can't.  Shouldn't even try. And Laurence Olivier couldn't do us. \nWILSON You ever been to London? \nELAINE Only in the movies. \nWILSON I've 'ardly ever left it. \nELAINE Yeah, well, you're here now -- (re Wilson's accent) -- where hurricanes hardly ever happen. \nWILSON I've got the hang of the driving.  Found this place all right. \nELAINE Stick with me, kid.  Looks big when you get here but you can cover it in five minutes. \nBeat. \nELAINE (cont'd) So, is there anybody in your family who's not a criminal? \nWILSON Not that I recall. \nELAINE What about your grandmother? \nWILSON Nah -- she was married to me grandad -- he was as bent as a boomerang -- used to make knuckle-dusters down the shop. Crafty old sod. \nELAINE He alive to see this? \nWILSON (shakes head) Dropped dead in the stalls in the Odeon, Muswell Hill.  Watching Doris Day. \nELAINE What'd your father do? \nWILSON Black market during the war. \nElaine shakes her head. \nELAINE I guess you're just habitual. \nWILSON You sound like my fucking probation officer. \nELAINE Won't he be looking for you about now? \nWILSON Good luck to him.  He couldn't find his prick if he didn't wear Y-fronts. \nELAINE Minor officials bother you, don't they? \nWILSON Do us a favor.  Can't even go have a slash without 'em saying, what're you going in there for? \nEXT. ELAINE'S BUILDING.  DAY. \nElaine and Wilson enter.  Stacy not far behind.  Catches outside gate before it slams shut. \nCUT. \nINT. ELAINE'S BUILDING.  DAY. \nWilson and Elaine turn the corner into the corridor approaching her apartment door.  Pause to kiss.  Walk closer. \nAnd Stacy appears at the other end of the hall.  Both arms stretched out with the .38 at the end of them. \nSTACY Hi, kids. \nStarts to squeeze off a shot.  As Wilson pushes Elaine to the floor.  As another SHOT rings out from further along the hall behind Stacy.  Catching him across the cheek.  Only skimming him.  But knocking him down.  Bullet chipping the wall. \nUNCLE JOHN \nAcross from Stacy.  Freezes, his own gun in hand. \n", "test2_id": 2479, "test3_input": "ADHARA (scared) What's going on? \nAvery and Tom have drawn their guns. \nVALENTINE We think someone is here. \nADHARA We think? \nVALENTINE We can't find ... (what are their names?) ... two of our guys. \nTOM (fucking typical) Larry and Rick. \nADHARA Did somebody call the cops? \nTom snorts.  Avery looks at Valentine:  Haven't you told this girl anything? \nVALENTINE No. \nADHARA Why not? \nVALENTINE Because -- \nAVERY Because I'm taking care of it. \nADHARA You guys are fucking nuts, I'm calling -- \nShe starts to stand.  Valentine pulls her down. \nADHARA Hey. \nTOM Mr. Avery. \nAvery looks to Tom, who nods toward the back porch. \nTHEIR POV \nA silhouetted figure is tentatively making its way along the porch, trying not to be seen.  We don't get a very clear glimpse. \nAVERY \nDraws his gun and takes aim. \nTHE FIGURE \nCareful not to become fully visible, but growing more courageous with each step. \nAVERY \nLocked on him, waiting. \nVALENTINE \nPuts Adhara's hand to her ears. \nTHE FIGURE \nWe see a little more now than we have before. \nAVERY \nHe sees enough.  Squeezes off a series of SHOTS, the muzzle flash strobing the kitchen area like a flashbulb, Adhara and Valentine flinching. \nTHE FIGURE \nHit.  Spinning and collapsing to the ground. \nAVERY \nLowers his gun.  Turns to Tom. \nAVERY Watch my back. \nAvery moves out from behind the counter and heads for the body. \nEXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT. \nAvery makes his way to the figure, which is on its stomach and writhing slightly. \nAVERY \nCareful.  Takes the gun and turns the body over. \nSTACY \n", "test3_true": "AVERY \nPuzzled.  What the hell is this guy doing here?  He starts feeling around Stacy's jacket for anything useful, but is interrupted when his hand EXPLODES, accompanied by the sound of a gunshot.  He screams in pain. \nINT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT. \nValentine and Adhara drop to the floor.  Tom, gun raised and pointing, tries to see who shot Avery. \nEXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT. \nAvery is turning toward his assailant, but not fast enough. A shot rings out and part of his neck disappears in a blossom of blood.  Stunned, he falls on his side, gasping. \nAVERY'S POV \nUncle John.  Close by, huddled by the lip of the cliff.  He starts to move cautiously toward Avery and Stacy. \nINT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  KITCHEN.  NIGHT. \nTom squints, trying to see. \nTOM Fuck. \nVALENTINE What? \nTOM Avery's down. \nTOM'S POV \nA piece of Uncle John's silhouette appears. \nTOM \nFires at it.  Didn't hit anything. \nTOM Fuck this. \nTom jumps up and runs for the living room, firing his gun in front of him toward where he last saw Uncle John's silhouette. \nLIVING AREA \nTom runs through and reaches the sliding doors to the back porch.  A portion of the frame SPLINTERS from a gun shot as he gains access to the other side of the back porch. \nEXT. BIG SUR HOUSE.  BACK PORCH.  NIGHT. \nTom is through the sliding doors and trying to make his way around to the driveway. \nUNCLE JOHN \nCrouched behind the opposite end of the porch, sticks his head up. \nHIS POV \nTom crossing to the steps, slips on the damp wood, tries to right himself. \nUNCLE JOHN \nSqueezes off two shots. \nTOM \nIs shot in the ankle as he is about to reach the steps.  He yelps in pain, tries to raise his gun. \nUNCLE JOHN \nCrouched down.  A shot flies over his head. \nTOM \nStops shooting.

21   INT. EXECUTIVE FLOOR -- HALLWAY -- AFTER                     21 
Tyler follows Janine down the corridor. She looks him up and down, doesn't like what she sees. 
JANINE You're too skinny. And you smell like french fries and cigarettes. 
TYLER Nice to see you too. 
JANINE You want me to lie? 
Tyler smiles, he likes that she doesn't lie. Janine scrolls through a Palm Pilot as she walks. They approach the double doors to Charles' office. 
JANINE Try not to give him a heart attack. 
TYLER Okay. 
Tyler bangs through the doors. Janine grimaces. 
22   INT. CAVERNOUS EXECUTIVE OFFICE -- LATER                     22 
A row of floor-to-ceiling windows blocked by vertical blinds. Sunlight glows behind them. There's a lot of leather, brass and rich wood, breathing power. There's a flat screen computer, but no personal effects anywhere. 
Charles sits at his massive desk. As Tyler enters, Charles registers his injuries. A flicker of something over Charles' face. Tyler stands. 
TYLER I came to see how much it costs, because I'm giving you the money back. 
CHARLES How much what costs? 
TYLER That lawyer. 
Beat. 
CHARLES Ah. That lawyer, Tyler, costs 450 dollars an hour. 
In spite of himself... 
TYLER Christ. 
CHARLES Tell me about it. 
TYLER I wanted to make sure you understood it wasn't me who called you. 
CHARLES I understand. You could do worse than have a father who bails you out of jail 
TYLER I don't want to be bailed out of anything. 
Charles looks at his son. 
TYLER I'll get an invoice from Janine. 
Tyler leaves, slamming the door behind him. 
23   INT. HALLWAY.                                             23 
Tyler stops, catching himself, realizing the emptiness of the gesture. He looks up and sees Janine looking at him. 
24   INT. WALL STREET COFFEE SHOP -- AFTER.                    24 
Tyler in the same booth, surrounded by a commotion of businessmen and women. He's writing in his Journal, his foot tapping fast. We see the very act of writing eases him, loosening his strangled grip on the pen, slowing down the manic rhythm of his foot. 
25   EXT. PRIVATE SCHOOL. JUST AFTER.                            25 
It's just after three, Caroline emerges from school in a CLUSTER OF 6TH GRADE GIRLS. One of them dips her head towards Caroline's ear, as if to share a secret. Whatever she says makes Caroline's face crumble, almost to tears, and the girls snicker. 
Tyler hops from his perch on a parked car. His bike leans on a fire hydrant. 
TYLER (to Caroline) Hey. 
He looks at the girls, sizing them up, and flicks his cigarette to the sidewalk, cool as hell. The girls have a group swoon. 
He takes Caroline by the elbow... 
TYLER Excuse us, we're due in surgery. 
He gets his bike and leads her down the block, towards Fifth Avenue. 
CAROLINE What happened to your face? 
TYLER Horrible threshing accident. 
CAROLINE You're so retarded. 
TYLER Don't mock the afflicted. Here, I brought you something. 
He hands her the book of Myths.

HARDING (CONT'D) (his voice rising as he goes on) ... or making me aware of a condition in my life, then I say, categorically speaking, the hell with you, Taber! I don't have to justify the condition of my life to you or any of you. No matter what I will carry on until I fully understand what that function is regardless of the form or content. Regardless of the fact we must try to understand the function of our capacity to obtain, to personify the condition, the condition of our existence, our existence... 
TABER You know what, Harding? I think you're some kind of morbid asshole or something. You've been talking about your wife evere since I can remember. You know, she's on your mind and blah, blah, blah and on and on and when are you going to wise up and turn her loose! 
FREDRICKSON Yeah, wise up, Harding. 
SEFELT Yeah, turn her loose! 
ACUTES (start pouring it on) Yeah, who do you think you are anyway?... He thinks he's God Almighty... He's a snob... He's a schmuck... Dumbbell... Creep... Cretin... Idiot... Get rid of him... Ship him upstairs... 
RUCKLY (chiming in) Ffffffuck da wife... 
BANCINI (wagging his head) Tired... Awful tired... 
ACUTES (not letting up) Zap him... Give 'im lobotomy... Cut his nuts off... He doesn't have any... Fag... Pervert. 
BANCINI (in a strong angry voice) I'm tired! 
Everyone hushes. 
BIG NURSE Somebody see to Mister Bancini. 
Two or three Acutes get up and try to soothe Bancini, but he isn't to be hushed. 
BANCINI Tired. Tired. Oh God, I'm tired... 
Big Nurse nods to Washington, who goes to Pete, and gives his arm a jerk toward the door. Bancini is unmovable. 
Big Nurse signals Nurse Pilbow, who heads for the nurses' station. 
Washington senses danger, lets go of Pete's arm, backs away. 
WASHINGTON You a good boy, Mistah Bancini... 
Nurse Pilbow returns, hypodermic needle in hand. 
Pete turns to his fellow inmates. 
BANCINI You see... it's a lotta baloney... It's all a lotta baloney... 
NURSE PILBOW Yes, yes, Mister Bancini, now if you'll just be calm... 
BANCINI That's all it is, just a lotta baloney. Ya see, I can't help it, can't... 
NURSE PILBOW (working her way around Bancini) Yes, I know, I know... 
She gets him in the ass, with the needle, and springs back. 
BANCINI ... don't ya see. I was born dead. Not you. You wasn't born dead. Ahhh, it's been so hard... (starts going over, slowly; sighing and crying) Tired... I'm tired... aw-ful tired... 
McMurphy looks around at the others. 
Each patient is locked in his own world -- oblivious to Bancini's state. 
EXT. BASKETBALL COURT - DAY 
WIDE SHOT of entire court, surrounded by a high fence topped off with barbed wire, as Washington and Warren escort the Acutes -- including Bromden, Ellis, a lobotomy case and several other Chronics -- through the gate onto the court, which is run down, with cracks in its surface and leaves scattered everywhere. 
Martini, who is carrying the ball, runs ahead, followed by Scanlon, where he starts dribbling the ball in a frantic circle, suddenly passes the ball to nothing. 
MARTINI (as he throws ball) Catch it! Catch it! 
The ball rolls to the corner. 
WASHINGTON Martini, there ain't nobody there, ya dumb goon! Go get the ball! 
MARTINI No! 
Martini turns away, his feelings hurt. Washington goes after the ball, when Martini goes running after it. 
MARTINI (CONT'D) I get it! I get it! 
But Washington gives Martini a body check and beats him to the ball. 
Martini tries to get the ball from Washington, who is quite agile and teases him as he returns to the court where he and Warren start shooting baskets, freezing Martini and Scanlon out. 
The other patients just hang around or walk, as if in a prison yard. 
Cheswick stands in close proximity to McMurphy and Harding, who stand watching the action. McMurphy finally offers a cigarette to Harding, who accepts. They both light up. 
MCMURPHY Well, say, buddy, is that the usual pro-cedure for those Group Ther'py shindigs? Bunch of chickens at a peckin' party? 
HARDING A pecking party? 
MCMURPHY That's right, buddy. And you want to know who pecks the first peck? 
HARDING AND CHESWICK Who? Who? 
MCMURPHY Ah, come off it! It's that Big Nurse, that's who... 
The other Acutes have gathered around McMurphy and Harding. 
HARDING It's as simple as that. You've been on our ward six hours and have already simplified the work of Freud, Jung and Maxwell Jones in one grand analogy: it's a pecking party. 
MCMURPHY I'm not talking about Fred Yoong or Maxwell Jones, buddy, what I'm talkin' about is that crummy meeting and what that nurse did to you! 
HARDING Did to me? 
MCMURPHY Did to you and all the rest of you guys.

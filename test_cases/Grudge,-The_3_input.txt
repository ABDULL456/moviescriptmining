JENNIFER Why? 
Susan asks Suzuki in Japanese.    He shrugs. 
SUZUKI (trying his English:) Ex-pen-sive. 
Matthew suddenly realizes: 
MATTHEW Where's Mom? 
We slowly CRANE UP to the SECOND FLOOR HALL, moving towards the REAR ROOM at the end. The door is ajar. 
44a                                                            44a INT. THE HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY Susan comes up the stairs, worried. 
SUSAN Mom?   Where are you? 
44b   INT. THE HOUSE - FRONT ROOM - DAY                        44b 
Susan looks inside -- Emma isn't there. She's about to leave when something catches her attention. She walks to 
THE CLOSET. The door is open. Susan kneels down, looking at something inside it. She picks it up -- 
-- it's the CERAMIC CAT Karen found earlier. As Susan examines it, she notices something on the wall of the closet (which we don't see). Her face softens, and she smiles. 
MATTHEW (O.S.) Did you get her? 
SUSAN (under her breath:) Take a pill, will ya? 
Susan stands and walks out of the room. But we stay in the closet, PANNING TO REVEAL the closet wall. It's covered with BLACK CRAYON, low to the ground, the work of a child. The images are dozens of BLACK CATS.

45   INT. THE HOUSE - REAR ROOM - DAY                             45 
Emma stands in the dead center of the empty bedroom. 
Looking directly up at the ceiling. 
Susan enters, placing the ceramic cat on THE SHELF where Karen found it earlier. Except Susan faces it INTO THE ROOM. 
SUSAN C'mon, Mom. You know what the doctor said about stairs. 
She takes Emma's hand, but the old woman doesn't move. 
Matthew and Jennifer enter, worried. 
MATTHEW She okay? 
SUSAN Mom?   What is it? 
Everyone follows her gaze to the ceiling.   Only Emma has the unmistakable look of dread on her face. 
A long beat. 
INT. THE HOUSE - HALLWAY - DAY Suzuki walks from the kitchen into the hallway, giving the place one final look-over. 
He pauses by the open bathroom door.   Looks inside.

47   INT. THE HOUSE - BATHROOM - DAY                                  47 
Suzuki enters, looking at THE TUB:    filled to the brim. 
After a moment, Suzuki kneels down next to the bathtub.     He pulls the thin CHAIN connected to the rubber stopper -- 
-- but the end of the chain comes out of the water.      Hmmm. It's not connected after all. 
Suzuki eyes the plug at the bottom of the tub. 
Then he takes off his jacket.   Rolls up his shirt sleeve. 
And reaches into the water for the rubber stopper. 
It's just out of reach. 
He rolls up his sleeve a little more.   Reaches deeper -- 
-- suddenly there's a BURST OF SOUND: a dull THUMPING, something THRASHING in water, the SCREAMING of a YOUNG BOY, voice MUFFLED by water -- 
-- Suzuki recoils as water SPLASHES UP around him -- 
-- he falls away from the tub in horror, landing on his butt. 
THE BATHTUB: Filled to the brim.     Still and silent.    Not so much as a ripple on the surface.

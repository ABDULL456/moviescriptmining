MARGARET Sure of that? 
RICHARD Nope.   Not at all. Margaret takes a look at herself in the mirror. 
MARGARET Well, come on.   If we're going to do this, we might as well put on a show. 
INT. PAXTON ESTATE - DAY 
Downstairs, the engagement party is in full swing.   The starched wait staff stands out in the crowd, because the raucous party- goers are all dressed in flannel, T-shirts and baseball hats. 
Ponytails rule for the women, and almost all the men have shaggy hair and beards.   No dress code here. Like the house, the party is first class.   Ice sculptures melt, champagne is served on silver trays, and the buffet overflows with salmon and king crab. Margaret works the crowd like a pro and holds court with some WELL WISHERS, Richard's parents, and Balzac. 
MARGARET I went to Union college in upstate New York. It's a small liberal arts school that no one has ever heard of. Richard comes to the group and hands Margaret a drink. MARGARET (cont'd) (looks at glass) Lime? 
RICHARD Be right back. Richard leaves to fetch lime wedges.   Geoffrey elbows Debbie in the side, "What was that?" 
WELL WISHER #1 How long have you been with your company? 
MARGARET Since I graduated college. Richard comes back with the lime.   Margaret takes it and doesn't say thank you. 
RICHARD She's been there since she was nineteen. 
GEOFFREY Nineteen?   Wow.   That's how long? 
MARGARET Oh, who's counting... Geoffrey could let it go, but wants to push her. 
GEOFFREY No.   How many years is that?   Exactly. Margaret gives Geoffrey the slightest look. 
MARGARET Well, let me see.   That would be sixteen or seventeen years.   Exactly. 
GEOFFREY I was never good with big numbers.   That makes you... thirty six now? 
MARGARET Just turned thirty seven.   Born on May 20th. I'm a Taurus. Geoffrey and Margaret give each other a smile. MARGARET (cont'd) (to Richard) I need some protein. 
RICHARD There's some salmon. Margaret shakes her head no. RICHARD (cont'd) Crab? Margaret nods yes.   Richard steps away to find a waiter. Geoffrey watches his son do Margaret's bidding. 
GEOFFREY Keep him on a short leash, huh?   Does he roll over when you whistle? Debbie hits Geoffrey. 
DEBBIE He's just being a good host. Richard comes right back with a waiter in tow.   For Geoffrey's benefit, Margaret makes a point to thank Richard. 
MARGARET Thank you, honey.   You're being so sweet. Richard is surprised, but remembers they're a couple. 
RICHARD Uh, sure.   Honey. 
WELL WISHER #2 So you just got some big promotion? 
MARGARET I'm editor in chief, now. Richard tenderly puts his arm around Margaret. 
RICHARD 
(BEAMING) I'm so proud of my girl. 
From behind them, a melodic, etherial VOICE interrupts. 
VOICE (O.S.) Editor in chief?   You're marrying up, Richard. Everyone turns around to find GERTRUDE THURMAN (26).   She is Grace Kelly in Patagonia and Timberland.   Adding insult to injury, she doesn't have eyeliner on. 
RICHARD Gert!? Richard snaps his arm back, hitting Margaret in the head, and spilling her tonic water on her shirt.   He doesn't notice what he's done, and leaves Margaret.   She's peeved. RICHARD (cont'd) 
(FLUSTERED) What are you?   What are you doing here? 
GERTRUDE Your dad made me come. 
RICHARD From Chicago? Gertrude laughs.   The group watches these two see each for the first time in years.   There is instant chemistry, and Richard has forgotten about Margaret completely. 
GERTRUDE No.   I live here now. 
RICHARD You what?

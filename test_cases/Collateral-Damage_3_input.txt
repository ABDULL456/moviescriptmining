There's a horrible SCREECH. A TAXI SKIDS sideways to avoid the FedEx truck and hits Gordy. He's in the air, tumbling, then smacks to the ground. 
Gordy looks up, through the smoke and falling debris. Then struggles to his hands and knees. 
GORDY Anne! 
He tries to stand, then falls down, screaming in pain, a large shard of glass embedded in his leg. 
People come to help him, but Gordy only cares about finding Anne and Matt. He looks around desperately but can't see them, when... 
His eyes go to the spaceship, in pieces on the pavement.

Gordy screams out his agony -- 
GORDY Noooooo!!! 
45   EXT. COLOMBIAN CONSULATE                                       45 
The blast detonated here. Some men from the Navigators are dead. MIKE BRANDT is not. Rises from the devastation, gun in hand, as SIRENS wail in the distance. 
46   EXT. 68TH AND MADISON - LATER                                  46 
Emergency personnel - EMS, NYPD, NYFD -- swarm the area. 
Two white plastic sheets cover two bodies. 
Across the street, PARAMEDICS work on Gordy's leg. 
PARAMEDIC #1 We're gonna give you a shot. 
Gordy's oblivious to the pain.     Shoves him away. 
GORDY I need to see them! 
PARAMEDIC #1 We gotta help you right now. 
PARAMEDIC #2 We've done all we can for 'em, Gordy. 
47   ANOTHER ANGLE                                                  47 
FBI agent JOE PHIPPS ducks under the police tape.     REGGIE DRAY, a young agent, meets him. As they walk -- 
DRAY Device functioned in front of the Colombian Consulate just as a motorcade full of brass arrived. 
PHIPPS Who were the brass, and why were they here?

47   CONTINUED:                                                     47 
DRAY No one's talking yet, but it smells high-level. There were Colombians and Americans in the cars. Three of 'em ate it. Guy on the phone -- 
He indicates Brandt, talking on a cell phone. 
DRAY -- is one of the survivors. Name's Brandt. C.I.A. 
That gets Phipps' interest momentarily. Then, as they continue toward the consulate, he notices security cameras on the building. 
PHIPPS Check the surveillance cameras? 
DRAY We're pulling up the video now. 
PHIPPS (stops; looks around) Where's N.Y.P.D. on this? 
DRAY They know it's ours. They're helping with shoe-leather. 
Phipps' eyes go to the white sheets up the street. 
DRAY We got two dead bystanders, a mother and four-year-old son. The father's over there with a leg wound. (indicates Gordy) Guy's a lieutenant with the New York F.D. 
PHIPPS Anybody talk to him yet? 
DRAY We've been giving him room. 
48   BACK TO GORDY                                                  48 
In b.g., Mike, the veteran firefighter in Gordy's engine company, looks under the sheets with a cop.

Junior puts a gentle hand on Gordy's shoulder. 
JUNIOR Gordy. 
Gordy looks up him, meets his eyes. 
JUNIOR Me and Mike are here. 
GORDY ... I was late... They shouldn't have been there... 
JUNIOR It's not your fault. 
GORDY I need to see them. 
Mike has walked up, lays a comforting hand on Gordy. 
MIKE No. You don't need to see 'em that way, Gordo. 
Junior spots a news camera crew focusing on Gordy's grief, calls at a cop. 
JUNIOR Get those goddamn people outta here! 
Phipps, approaching with Dray, addresses the same cop.

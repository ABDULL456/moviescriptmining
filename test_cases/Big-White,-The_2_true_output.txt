PAUL Shush, now.  (reading again) "We hasten to add, Tourette Syndrome is not..." 
MARGARET Fuck them. 
Paul is about to say something, but returns to the letter. 
PAUL "As well, please reference our previous decisions regarding your claims for ADD, ODO, OCD, ADHOPHI... (treading lightly) Honey.  I know you don't like to talk about it, but maybe it's not... what we might think it is but... maybe it's just stress?  Remember that cruise?  I saw you. You were happy. 
Margaret looks at him, crestfallen. 
PAUL (cont'd) I'm sorry.  I'm just really tired. 
MARGARET They say you can't get it all of a sudden but I did.  I really, really did. 
PAUL I know.  They just don't -- 
MARGARET I'll kill myself.  Then they'll see. 
PAUL That is nonsense talk. 
MARGARET Then you can go off and... (sobbing again) ...marry someone normal. 
PAUL You're the most normal girl I know. 
MARGARET I'm not crazy, Paul.  Something's really wrong with me. 
He takes her to a small sofa, cradles her in his arms. 
PAUL I know, Sweetie.  I know.  And we're gonna find you the best specialists in... (a second, then confident) ...what you have that we can. 
MARGARET Promise? 
PAUL I really think things are going to turn around.  Call me cr... I just have a feeling.  You just leave everything to me, OK?  Is that OK?  Leave everything to me?  I promise. 
MARGARET (gently) Shit bag. 
PAUL That's my girl.

70/71 INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                               70/71 
Where Edward G. Robinson (as the character Keyes in "Double Indemnity") grills a man about a fake insurance claim. 
EDWARD G. ROBINSON "Every time one of these phonies comes along it ties knots in my stomach... I can't eat.  That's how I knew your claim was crooked..." 
At the sound of DOORBELL, the whole scene freezes.  We are -- 
Tiffany at her desk, working on the computer.  Ted has paused the DVD, puts down the Barnell file and opens the door on a snow covered PIZZA GUY, soggy pizza box in hand. 
TED Hey. 
PIZZA GUY Hi there.  That'll be $12.97. 
Ted looks at his watch. 
TED What about thirty minutes or free? 
PIZZA GUY Doesn't apply when it's snowing. 
TED (digging out his wallet) So nine months of the year your guarantee is worthless? 
PIZZA GUY It doesn't snow every day. 
TED They should really tell people when they order. 
TIFFANY Would you just give him the money already? 
PIZZA GUY It's not my decision. 
TED I know that.  I'm just saying. 
PIZZA GUY Sure. 
TED You understand though? 
PIZZA GUY Absolutely.

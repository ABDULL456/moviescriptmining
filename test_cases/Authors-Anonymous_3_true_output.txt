COLETTE --Powerful. 
ALAN Powerful.   Yes. Powerful. 
COLETTE We love documentaries. 
ALAN We do. 
They look at each other again: What have we gotten into? 
COLETTE (V.O.) Natasha, the Russian peasant, dressed oh-so-slowly... 
5   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - EVENING 
A POSTER BOARD SIGN--someone went to Kinko's--is posted prominently reading: QUIET, PLEASE--WRITERS AT WORK. 
COLETTE (V.O.) (Reading) ...consumed totally, completely, absolutely, by endless thoughts of Yuri fondling her breast, his other hand groping her womanhood, knowing... 
They sit around the dining room table. Colette, convinced she's the next Amy Tan, reads aloud from her TYPED PAGES. The others all have copies in front of them. We recognize Henry, the frog waiting to become a prince, making copious notes and Alan, oh-so-proud, hanging on every word. Beaming. 
Three others round out the group: 
Younger MAN (early 30s). Unshaven. Always thinks he's the coolest guy in any room. Can't avoid glances at the camera. 
CAPTION: WILLIAM BRUCE 
The OLDEST MEMBER of the group (over 60) sits with his arms folded as he listens, shifting in his chair. Captain Grumpy. 
CAPTION: JOHN K. BUTZIN 
Finally, the young (mid-to-late 20s), angelic, WOMAN listening intently, the one who probably stopped to rescue a cat on her way here. 
CAPTION: HANNAH RINALDI 
COLETTE (CONT'D) ...Any second that she might explode, her chastity spraying across the ceiling...Spraying across the ceiling like passionate graffiti. Natasha never thought such a moment possible. "Have I satisfied you, Natasha?" Yuri had inquired after their fourth round of vodka-soaked lovemaking. "Nyet, Not yet," Natasha stated, exhausted, but grateful. 
Awkward silence around the table as Colette removes her reading glasses and waits. Alan clears his throat, looking cheerful. 
ALAN Well?   Comments? 
6   INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       6 
Henry's sparse studio apartment. Minimal furniture. His laptop is set up on an old door, stretched across some blue plastic crates. 
There are BOOKS piled everywhere. All sorts of books. And PAPER -- pieces of paper, including letters and cards and printed emails, dozens of them, are taped throughout the small apartment. 
We are introduced to Henry the writer: pondering over his battered laptop, pacing up and down the floor, checking his nearly empty refrigerator, stretched out on his Goodwill couch, watching TV. 
Finally, inspiration. Henry rushes to his desk and taps out a sentence or two on his computer, feeling proud for his accomplishment. 
HENRY (V.O.) I graduated from the University of Illinois. English major. Taught high school for a couple years, but hated it. Moved out here to be a writer. 
7   EXT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT                                             7 
As Henry's voice over continues, we see him in uniform with pizza in hand at the front door of a house. Rings doorbell. 
HENRY (V.O.) I work two jobs. Delivering pizzas and cleaning carpets. Good jobs for a writer. 
8    INT. HOUSE - DAY/NIGHT                                             8 
Henry cleaning the carpets as the heavily-tattooed MOTORCYCLE DUDE points to a dirty spot: Over here. 
HENRY (V.O.) You meet lots of interesting people. 
9    INT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY                                       9 
Henry points to the letters on the wall. C.U. picks up on phrases like "We regret to inform you," or "Sorry, but this story isn't right for us," or "The Baxter Agency currently isn't accepting new clients." 
HENRY (V.O.) I have two unpublished novels. Working on my third, Pizza to Go. These are my rejection letters. Rejected by agents. Rejected by publishers. When you think about it, it's pretty amazing how many ways people can reject you. 
10   INT. ALAN AND COLETTE'S HOUSE -- DINING ROOM - NIGHT               10 
Henry, John, Alan, Colette, Hannah, and William sit around the table. Impressive buffet of cold cuts, cheeses, and shrimp has been set out.

GHOSTS (variously) Inconspicuous Sweeney was, Quick and quiet and clean `e was. Back of his smile, under his word, Sweeney heard music that nobody heard. Sweeney pondered and Sweeney planned, Like a perfect machine 'e planned, Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle, Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle... 
The specters are becoming more insistent, their strange impassivity giving way to accusation as the flickering red flame becomes an inferno-- 
GHOSTS (variously) Sweeney was smooth, Sweeney was subtle, Sweeney would blink and rats would scuttle. Inconspicuous Sweeney was, Quick and quiet and clean 'e was, Like a perfect machine 'e was, Was Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeney! Sweeeeeneeeeey! On this explosive note we revolve -- away from the ghostly Furies-- 
To discover-- 
SWEENEY TODD. Standing before us. An unclear figure, silhouetted in blazing red flames. 
We slowly push in on him as: 
GHOSTS Attend the tale of Sweeney Todd. He served a dark and a vengeful god. What happened then--

GENTLEMAN Well, who's to say? 
BANKER And he wouldn't want us to give it away, 
GHOSTS (variously) Not Sweeney, Not Sweeney Todd, The Demon Barber of Fleet Street. 
On this note, we push in tight on the figure of Todd... 
Music and the clanging of a clock tower bell are heard as we slowly begin pulling back and are imperceptibly transported to... 
2   EXT. SHIP -- THAMES -- ALMOST DAWN                             2 
ANTHONY, a young sailor of about 20, is standing at the rail of a ship. We see the obscure shape of rigging and sails behind him. The cries of sailors echo. 
Behind him stand the GENTLEMAN and the BANKER. They are looking past Anthony, looking at something. They move away as Anthony peers through the fog, straining to see... 
London. 
Gradually, as the ship approaches, the towering spires and mountainous rooftops of the city begin to stand out in relief, to emerge through the fog like a tiger creeping toward its prey. 
Music continues as Anthony takes in the dreadful and magnificent spectacle of the 19th Century metropolis. The gnarl of rooftops. The labyrinth of streets and alleys. The black trails of smoke reaching up like skeletal fingers from a thousand chimneys. 
London. Sulfurous London. 
Anthony is awestruck. 
ANTHONY I have sailed the world, beheld its wonders From the Dardanelles To the mountains of Peru, But there's no place like London--! 
Then-- 
(CONTINUED) PAGE 5. 2   CONTINUED:                                                    2 
Sweeney Todd steps to Anthony's side, grimly interrupting-- 
TODD No, there's no place like London. 
ANTHONY Mr. Todd...? 
TODD You are young. Life has been kind to you. You will learn. 
Todd's glares forward, his haunted gaze never leaving the approaching city. 
3   EXT. DOCKS -- DAWN                                             3 
Music continues as Todd stands very still and takes in the shadowy figures on the docks. 
Anthony seems almost lost at his side, overwhelmed by the scale and aura of the city. 
ANTHONY Lord ... takes your breath away, doesn't it? 
Todd shudders violently, almost snarling. 
TODD There's a hole in the world Like a great black pit And the vermin of the world Inhabit it And its morals aren't worth What a pig could spit And it goes by the name Of London. At the top of the hole Sit the privileged few Making mock of the vermin In the lower zoo, Turning beauty into filth and greed. I too Have sailed the world, and seen its wonders For the cruelty of men Is as wondrous as Peru, But there's no place like London! 
Anthony looks at his friend, mystified by his grim reaction to the city. 
(CONTINUED) PAGE 6. 3   CONTINUED:                                                    3 
TODD I beg your indulgence, Anthony ... My mind is far from easy. In these once familiar streets I feel shadows everywhere... 
ANTHONY Shadows...? 
TODD Ghosts. 
Anthony looking at him, questioning. Todd continues quietly: 
TODD There was a barber and his wife, And she was beautiful, A foolish barber and his wife, She was his reason and his life, And she was beautiful, And she was virtuous. And he was... (a breath) Naive. 
Anthony watches, rapt, as Todd remembers...

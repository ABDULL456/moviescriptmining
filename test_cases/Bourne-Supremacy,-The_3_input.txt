PAMELA Excuse me. 
ABBOTT We were throwing money at him. Throwing                 * it at him and asking him to keep it dark.               * 
PAMELA May I finish?                                           * 
ABBOTT Conklin migh   t've been a nut   , but he               * wasn't a mol   e. You have me     his calendar          * for a couple    of days, I'll    prove he               * killed Linco   ln.                                      * (appea   ling to Marshal   l) This is supp   osed to be defi   nitive? 
PAMELA What's definitive, is that I just lost two people in Berlin! 
ABBOTT So what's yo   ur theory? (mocki   ng her) Conklin's re   aching out from the grave to protect his    good name? (incre   dulous) The man is d   ead. 
MARSHALL (he's heard enough) No one's disputing that, Ward. 
ABBOTT For crissake, Marty, you knew Conklin. Does this scan? I mean, at all? 
MARSHALL signals for quiet... 
MARSHALL Okay, cut to the chase, Pam.       What are you selling? 
PAMELA I think that Bourne and Conklin were in business. That Bourne is still involved.                * (MORE) 
PAMELA (CONT'D) And that wha   tever information I was going            * to buy in Be   rlin, it was big enough to               * make Bourne    come out from wherever he's              * been hiding    to kill again.                           * (to Ab   bott)                                    * How's that s   can?                                     * 
As the MANDARINS all start talking at once -- 
ZORN enters. Stands at the head of the table.      Tries to       * get their attention.                                              * 
ZORN                                     * Hey...                                                  * (they    look up)                                 * Look, you're    not gonna believe this, but             * Jason Bourne   's passport just came on the             * grid in Napl   es. 
ABBOTT blinks.   What?                                            *

121       EXT. FERRY BUILDING CUSTOMS HALL -- NIGHT                   121 
NEVINS. American. A junior, C.I.A. Field Officer. Walking from the parking lot, talking on his cellphone. 
NEVINS ...what can    I do? I can't. I'll call you when I know    what I'm into... (a has   sled pause) I don't know   , some guy's name came up on the computer   . (start   ing toward the build   ing) So start wit   hout me, if I can get there, I will. Later    ... 
NEVINS hangs up and pockets the phone.    He hustles towards the building. 
122       INT. CIA SITUATION ROOM -- DAY                              122 
The room is jumping. Agents tracking, working the phones and computers. PAMELA giving orders. ABBOTT watches. 
CRONIN                                     * (looks up from computer                          * screen)                                         * Looks like he's been detained.                         * 
PAMELA                                  * Who's going?     Us?                                   * 
CRONIN                                     * There's only a Consulate, they sent a                  * field officer out half an hour ago --                  * 
PAMELA                                     * (cuts him off)                                   * Then get a number, they need to know who               * they're dealing with.                                  * 
CRONIN already on it...                                          * 
123   INT. FERRY BUILDING HOLDING ROOM -- SUNSET                 123 
As NEVINS flashes his credentials to CARABINIERI at door, who gives an unimpressed shrug and lets him in. 
NEVINS takes his overcoat off, tosses it on the empty chair. We see a big ass .45 for just a second under his suit jacket. 
NEVINS Alright, Mr.    Bourne, is that your name? (BOURN   E nods) Name's Nevin   s. I'm with the US Consulate. Could I see    your passport? 
BOURNE, silent, hands over his passport. 
NEVINS (CONT'D) So, Mr. Bourne... 
NEVINS studies Bourne's passport... 
NEVINS (CONT'D)                            * What are you doing in Tangiers? 
Silence...                                                       * 
NEVINS (CONT'D) (faux friendly) Are you travelling alone?                              * 
BOURNE stares straight ahead. NEVINS comes around the         * table and sits in front of BOURNE.                            * 
NEVINS (CONT'D)                         * (in his face)                                 * Look, I don't know what you've done.                * But, you're gonna need to play ball here.           * 
NEVINS cell starts to ring.    He shrugs an apology, turns    * away and answers:                                             * 
NEVINS (cont'd) (CONT'D)               * Nevins...                                           * 
PAMELA/PHONE                            * This is Pamela Landy, a CI Supervisor               * calling from Langley, Virginia. Are you             * with a Jason Bourne now?                            * 
NEVINS (listens; looks at Bourne) Yes... 
A123   INT. CIA SITUATION ROOM -- DAY                         A123   * 
PAMELA on the phone.                                          * 
PAMELA                                  * Then use extreme caution. He can be very            * unpredictable and violent. Use whatever             * means necessary to...                               *

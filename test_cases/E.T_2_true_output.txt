The men reach the edge of the clearing and stop as they watch the spacecraft lift off. 
One red lighted heart races along an old country fence towards the departing spacecraft. Men with flashlights are still in pursuit. They stop at a wooden gate as they watch the spacecraft fly away. 
E.T., with face obstructed by a branch, and with red-heart aglow, watches the spacecraft fly away into the night. He utters a sorrowful moan. 
[He has been abandoned in a hostile alien world. This situation is guaranteed to generate audience empathy.] 
The men with flashlights pointed up towards the sky watch the space- craft fly away. They hear E.T.'s groan, and in unison point their flashlights in his direction. 
[Not only is the small childlike creature abandoned, but he is still in jeopardy of being captured by those who pursue him.] 
[This is the inciting event in E.T.'s story: his spacecraft has deserted him.] 
EXT: HILLTOP: NIGHT 
Below lies the city, lit up against the dark night sky. E.T slowly makes his way down the slope. 
Men with flashlights follow. They reach the hilltop, search the underbrush for the alien, then start down the slope after him. 
[This concludes the prelude to the story. Both the protagonist and antagonist have been introduced, and audience empathy has been established for the protagonist. The protagonist's primary objective is to survive and find a way home, while the antagonist's primary objective is to capture the alien.] 
EXT: SUBURBAN HOUSE: NIGHT 
[This is an establishing shot.] 
INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT 
A group of boys are sitting around a table playing a DUNGEONS AND DRAGONS game. One boy is on the telephone ordering a pizza. They throw wads of paper at each other as they play. 
Elliott, the youngest boy, sits behind the counter. He's separated from the other boys. After a few moments he yells that he's ready to play the game. 
[The character's positions are structured to emphasize Elliott's separation from the others.]

SKYLAR Well, what aren't you scared of? You live in your safe little world where nobody challenges you and you're scared shitless to do anything else-- 
WILL Don't tell me about my world. You're the one that's afraid. You just want to have your little fling with the guy from the other side of town and marry-- 
SKYLAR Is that what you think-- 
WILL some prick from Stanford that your parents will approve of. Then you'll sit around with the rest of the upper crust kids and talk about how you went slummin' too. 
SKYLAR I inherited that money when I was thirteen, when my father died. 
WILL At least you have a mother. 
SKYLAR Fuck you! You think I want this? That money's a burden to me. Every day I wake up and I wish I could give that back.  I'd give everything I have back to spend one more day with my father. But that's life. And I deal with it. So don't put that shit on me. You're the one that's afraid. 
WILL What the fuck am I afraid of?! 
SKYLAR You're afraid of me. You're afraid that I won't love you back. And guess what?  I'm afraid too. But at least I have the balls to it give it a shot. At least I'm honest with you. 
WILL I'm not honest? 
SKYLAR What about your twelve brothers? 
WILL Oh, is that what this is about? You want to hear that I don't really have any brothers? That I'm a fuckin' orphan? Is that what you want to hear? 
SKYLAR Yes, Will. I didn't even know that? 
WILL No, you don't want to hear that. 
SKYLAR Yes, I do, Will. 
WILL You don't want to hear that I got cigarettes put out on me when I was a little kid. That this isn't surgery. 
Will lifts his shirt, revealing a six inch SCAR on his torso. 
WILL You don't want to hear that. Don't tell me you want to hear that shit!! 
SKYLAR Yes I do. Did you ever think that maybe I could help you? That maybe that's the point, that we're a team? 
WILL What, you want to come in here and save me? Is that what you want to do? Do I have a sign that says "save me" on my back? 
SKYLAR I don't want to "save" you. I just want to be with you. I love you. I love you! 
Will, full of self-loathing, raises his hand to strike her. 
WILL Don't bullshit me! Don't fuckin' bullshit me! 
SKYLAR (standing up to him) You know what I want to hear?  I want to hear that you don't love me. If you tell me that, then I'll leave you alone. I won't ask any questions and I won't be in your life. 
A beat. Will looks Skylar dead in the eye. Lowers his hand. 
WILL I don't love you. 
He walks out. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SKYLAR'S DORM -- NIGHT 
Will leaves pulling on his clothes. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY, OFFICE -- DAY 
Will sits across from two N.S.A. AGENTS, OLIVER DYTRESS and ROBERT TAVANO. These guys are smug, clean cut, gung-ho and looking sharp in twin navy blue suits. 
WILL So why do you think I should work for the National Security Agency? 
DYTRESS Well, you'd be working on the cutting edge. You'd be exposed to the kind of technology you couldn't see anywhere else because we've classified it. Super string theory, Chaos Math, Advanced algorithms-- 
WILL Codebreaking. 
DYTRESS That's one aspect of what we do. 
WILL Come on, that's what you do. You handle more than eighty percent of the intelligence workload. You're seven times the size of the C.I.A. 
DYTRESS That's exactly right, Will. So the question as I see it isn't "why should you work for N.S.A." it's "why shouldn't you?" 
WILL Why shouldn't I work for the National Security Agency? That's a tough one. 
Will bites his tongue, trying to make this work. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CHUCKIE'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Chuckie, Billy, and Will sit in the Sullivan kitchen. Billy cracks open a beer and Chuckie reads the sports page. Both boys are smoking. Will drinks a beer, distractedly. We hear the faint music track and soft moans of a PORNO MOVIE emanating from a back room. After a beat, Chuckie looks up. 
CHUCKIE Morgan, if you're watchin' pornos in my mom's room again I'm gonna give you a fuckin' beatin'! 
After a beat, Morgan comes out of the back room, red-faced. 
MORGAN (innocently) What's up guys?

GROANS from the parents-- 
INT. SHERIFF'S OFFICE -- NIGHT -- SHADOW 
Shadow, face bruised, hands cuffed behind him, is pushed in through the door to be booked. 
SHADOW I hope the sucker does die, man! Mess with me, that's what you get! 
Sam steps in behind him and meets his Chief Deputy RAY HERNANDEZ, coming from the other direction. 
RAY Hospital says the other kid is in bad shape-- 
SAM (Glances ahead) The shooter local? 
RAY (Shakes his bead) Down from Houston. I think he knew the girl before. 
SAM Okay--we'll take a statement from all the GIs before they go back to post. You can get the story from Otis over at the club. 
RAY Any poop on the John Doe you found out there today? 
SAM Nothin' much. The Rangers put Ben Wetzel on it. Catch you later. 
As Ray steps out, Pilar looking distraught, walks into the station, passing right by Sam without seeing him. 
CU SAM 
Wonders what she's doing there-- 
SAM'S POV -- PILAR 
She stands by an unoccupied reception desk, very upset, unable to attract anyone's attention because of the activity around the shooting.  She looks tired and a bit scared under the harsh overhead light. 
SAM (O.S.) Pilar. 
PILAR AND SAM 
Pilar looks around. Sam is standing by her. We can tell there is some history between these two. 
SAM Something wrong? 
PILAR They've got my Amado. 
SAM Got him here? 
PILAR Somebody called--something about an electronics store. 
SAM I'll see what's going on. 
He starts away, stops, comes back-- 
SAM I was--I was real sorry about Nando. He was a good fella. We haven't talked since. 
PILAR We haven't talked since high school. 
SAM Yeah. I'll go check on your boy. 
Pilar watches Sam go-- 
REAR OF OFFICE 
Travis sits typing away at a word processor as Athena, in tears, gives testimony. 
ATHENA --so Richie just didn't say nothin' 'cause he didn't want to get into it, see, and the next thing I know there's shots and Richie is down. It happened so fast-- 
SAM (O.S.) Excuse me-- 
We WIDEN to see Sam standing over the desk-- 
SAM We got some boys you run in earlier today? 
TRAVIS Yeah. I pulled the bunch that hangs at Pico Bernal's place. We finally caught them with something. 
SAM You got a juvenile with 'ern--Amado Cruz? 
Travis looks at his booking sheets-- 
TRAVIS Yeah--let's see--the other ones say he wasn't in on the theft, he just knows how to hook things up. We've been trying to contact a parent. 
INT. JAIL HALLWAY 
Sam walks with Amado, who is trying to look defiant-- 
SAM They tell me you're good at fixing things. 
Nothin-- 
SAM Your father was a hell of a mechanic.

PAUL Rachel. She just got home. 
RACHEL Again. 
KYM I had no idea you were so angry, doctor. 
RACHEL I'm not. 
PAUL Kymmie, your sister's got a lot on her plate. She's uptight about... 
RACHEL I'm not uptight, Dad.

PAUL She's meeting Sidney's folks for the first time, there's menus, there's all that live music, you're home, there's a thousand things to worry about. 
CAROL Absolutely, a wedding will take it right out of you, boy. 
PAUL Yeah, it would be so lovely if we could all just... 
KYM (removing seeds) You people need to purge. You people really should go to Nar-Anon or something. I mean it. 
CAROL Oh my lord. Kym, we have gone through Nar-Anon, baby. You know that. 
RACHEL (turning her head) You people? You mean the people in this room? Your family? 
KYM All of you people living in this little world of judgement and paranoia and mistrust. I can feel it every second. At the slightest sign of ingratitude or absence of atonement it's like the freaking Salem Witch Trials around here. I might as well be... 
PAUL (pouncing) Don't even start... 
CAROL (standing next to her husband) Nobody can make you feel any way unless you let them, Kym.

KYM Thank you Carol, for your inevitable pearl of wisdom, but you people are my family. You people make me feel like shit a hundred times a day. You try living under Dad's constant monitoring for five minutes and see how you like it. 
PAUL What constant monitoring? 
KYM "I'll drive you!" "Carol, she's back!" "Don't sleep here, sleep there." "Here. Eat this." Dad, you're obsessed. 
RACHEL Please. That's hardly news. You may not know this...sure you do...the only way to engage Dad in any meaningful communication is to start the conversation with your name. "Have you heard from Kym? How's Kym?" It resuscitates him. It jars him into the moment. Like an alarm. 
PAUL That's unfair, Rachel. And completely untrue. 
RACHEL And she's even worse! "Dad, you're never going to believe this, but I lost the car again." "Dad, you're never going to believe this, but that check you sent me never showed up and my landlord hates me." "Dad, can somebody meet me downstairs with cab fare and you're never going to believe this but I need to go to the emergency room and my neighbor's suing me and my checkbook got stolen!" 
KYM Gee, Rach, sounds like you have some paternal/sibling issues to work through.

RACHEL Are you kidding? The two of you are like a double helix of crises. In the language of psychology one could say you both suffer from acute boundary issues. 
PAUL Rachel! It's nice that you're getting your Ph.D-- 
RACHEL (she throws up her hands.) --Oh god-- 
PAUL --but don't be patronizing. It's ugly. It doesn't become you. 
RACHEL How come she gets to spout off about paternal issues, but god forbid I should even reference the "boundary thing," even though I actually know what I'm talking about? 
KYM (waving her arms) Hello? By the way? I'm not in crisis. I haven't been in crisis for a year. 
RACHEL You just got out of rehab!

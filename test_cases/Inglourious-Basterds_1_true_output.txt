PERRIER Very well. The French Farmer sit's at his wooden dinner table across from The Nazi. The Women remain standing. Col Landa leans forward, and says to the Farmer in a low tone of 
CONFIDENTIALLY; 
COL LANDA Monsieur LaPadite, what we have to discuss,' would be better discussed in private. You'll notice, I left my men outdoors- if it wouldn't offend them, could you ask your lovely ladies to step outside. 
PERRIER You are right. 
G. 
PERRIER (to his women) Charlotte, would you take the girls outside. The Colonel and I need to have a few words. The Farmers wife follows her husbands orders, and gathers her daughter's taking them outside, closing the door behind them. The Two Men are alone, at the farmers dinner table, in the Farmers humble home. 
COL LANDA Monsieur LaPadite, I regret to inform you I've exhausted the extent of my French. To continue to speak it so inadequately, would only serve to embarrass me. However, I've been lead to believe you speak English quite well? 
PERRIER Oui. 
COL LANDA Well, it just so happens, I do as well. This being your house, I ask your permission to switch to English, for the remainder of the conversation? 
PERRIER By all means. They now speak ENGLISH; 
COL LANDA Monsieur LaPadite, while I'm very familiar with you, and your family. I have no way of knowing if you are familiar with who I am. Are you aware of my existence? The Farmer answers; 
PERRIER Yes. 
COL LANDA This is good. Are you aware of the job I've been ordered to carry out in France? 
I 
PERRIER Yes. The Colonel drinks more milk. 
COL LANDA Please tell me what you've heard? 
PERRIER I've heard, the fuhrer has put you in charge of rounding up the Jews left in France who are ether hiding, or passing for Gentile. The S.S.Colonel smiles. 
COL LANDA The Fuhrer couldn't of said it better himself. 
PERRIER But the meaning of your visit, pleasant though it is, is mysterious to me. The Germans looked through my house nine months ago for hiding Jews, and found nothing. 
COL LANDA I'm aware of that, I read the report on this area. But like any enterprise, when under new management, there's always a slight duplication of efforts. Most of it being a complete waste of time, but needs to be done nevertheless. I just have A few questions Monsieur LaPadite, if you can assist me with answers, my department can close the file on your family. Taking his black leather attache case, and placing it on the table, he takes out a folder from inside. He also extracts a expensive black fountain pen from his uniform front pocket. Opening the folder, and referring to it; 
COL LANDA Now before the occupation there were four Jewish families in this area, all dairy farmers like yourself. The Loveitts, The Doleracs, The Rollins, and The Dreyfus's, is that correct? 
PERRIER To my knowledge those were the Jewish families among the dairy farmers. - Heer Colonel, would it disturb you if I smoked my pipe? Looking up from his papers. 
COL LANDA Please, Monsieur LaPadite, it is your house, make yourself comfortable. The Farmer gets up from the table, goes to his shelf over the fireplace, and removes from it a WOODEN BOX that contains all the fixins to his pipe. He sits back down at the table with his Nazi guest. As The Farmer loads the bowel of his pipe with tobacco, sets a match to it, and begins slowly puffing, making it red hot, the S.S. Colonel studies the papers in front of him. 
COL LANDA Now according to these papers, all the Jewish families in this area have been accounted for - except, The Dreyfusis. Somewhere in the last year it would appear they have vanished. Which leads me to the conclusion that they've ether made good their escape, or someone is very successfully hiding them. (looking up from his papers, across the table at The 
FARMER) What have you heard about The Dreyfusis Monsieur LaPadite? 
PERRIER Only rumors - 
COL LANDA - I love rumors! Facts can be so misleading, where rumors, true or false are often reveling. So Monsieur LaPadite, what rumors have you heard regarding The Dreyfusis? The Farmerlooks at Landa. 
I. 
COL LANDA Speak freely Monsieur LaPadite, I want to hear what the rumors are, not who told them to you. The Farmer puffs thoughtfully on his pipe. 
PERRIER Again, this is just a rumor - but we heard the Dreyfusis had made there way into Spain. 
COL LANDA So the rumors you've heard have been of escape? 
PERRIER Yes. 
COL LANDA Were the LaPadites and the Dreyfusis friendly? As the Farmer answers this question, the CAMERA LOWERS behind his chair, to the floor, past the floor, to a small area underneath the floorboards revealing; 
FIVE HUMAN BEINGS lying vertically underneath the farmers floorboards. These human beings are The DREYFUSIS, who have lived lying down underneath the dairy farmers house for the past year. But one couldn't call what The Dreyfusis have done for the last year living. This family has done the only thing they could, hidden from a occupying army that wishes to exterminate them. 
PERRIER We were families in the same community, in the same bussiness. I wouldn't say we were friends, but members of the same community, we had common interest. The S.S. Colonel takes in this answer, seems to except it, then moves to the next question. 
COL LANDA Having never met the Dreyfusis, would you confirm for me the exact members of the household and their names? 
PERRIER There were five of them. The father, Jacob... .wife, Miram... her brother, Bob ... 
COL LANDA - How old is Bob? 
PERRIER Thirty - thirty one? 
COL LANDA Continue. 
PERRIER And the children... Amos... and Shoshanna. 
COL LANDA Ages of the children?

CHARLIE Shut up! Charlie barely refrains from hitting Ed. Instead he shoves him away. Ed stumbles. Falls. He looks up at Charlie, genuinely hurt and desperate. 
ED Adam's gone -- you act like it has nothing to do with you. 
(THEN/PAINED) We were inseparable, man. 
CHARLIE Yeah. And you know when I got popular? The minute I stopped hanging out with you. Charlie takes off. Ed watches him go. 
FADE TO: 
EXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREETS/VARIOUS -- NIGHT 
A while later. It's REALLY DARK now. Ed, gripping his duffle bag nervously, skates down a residential street. Houses here are spaced far apart and the lights in many of them are off. Ed is anxious, watchful. He knows it's not safe. Every dark corner is potentially the end of him. A few cars pass. Something moves behind him. Footsteps GAINING. Ed abandons his skateboard and BOLTS. A hand SLAMS on his shoulder, spins him around. IT's MARK, Charlie's pal from school. 
MARK You crossed my yard. Tracked your nerdjuice all over it. 
ED Sorry. Sorry-- 
MARK My mom works hard on that shit, 
MORON-- Ed glances around nervously, it's dark and anything... else could be out there. 
ED Can you just hit me? I don't have time for the build up. (he steels himself) Go. 
MARK Seriously? 
ED Jesus, man! Just do it! Fine. Mark winds up and SWINGS -- a brutal blow. Ed DUCKS and runs. Mark's immediately on his heels. The guys dodge and dart through the neighborhood. But Ed has experience in the art of losing bullies and he manages to shake Mark for a moment. Ed scrambles over a wooden fence, but his DUFFLE BAG GETS CAUGHT ON TOP. Most of his vamp hunting stuff SPILLS over on the OTHER SIDE OF THE FENCE. 
ED (CONT'D) Crap. Crap! There's not time to get the stuff. He can hear Mark approaching in the dark. He drops into a neighbor's backyard. 
EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT 
ED spins and slams right into MARK -- no, it's JERRY. Ed falls back and scrambles away, terrified. 
ED (CONT'D) Get away! I'm armed mother fucker! Jerry moves after Ed, angry but controlled. More like a man than a monster. 
EXT. FENCE -- NIGHT 
Mark pulls up on the other side of the wood fence. Sees Ed's VAMP HUNTING STUFF on the ground, laughs. 
MARK Unbelievable. A beat, Mark glances at the high fence. Decides he's done. He kicks some of Ed's stuff as he moves off. 
EXT. BACKYARD -- NIGHT 
Ed trips over kid's toys and bikes as he runs to the house. There's a porch light on over the back door. 
ED (pounding on door) Hey! Let me in! Please! But there's no answer. Ed is desperate, Sees Jerry closing in, walking across the backyard. Ed takes a ROCK and smashes the window over the kitchen sink. 
INT. HOUSE -- KITCHEN -- NIGHT 
Ed falls through the window into the kitchen. Looks out. JERRY stalks toward him. All hulking menace. But Ed's safe now. Calls out-- 
ED Forget it sucker! No invite! BAM! Jerry kicks in the kitchen door. Ed, terrified, falls back. 
JERRY Abandoned. I thought you did your homework. 
ED -- what? 
JERRY You've been watching me. I've been watching you. Seems fair. Ed BOLTS into the house. 
INT. HOUSE -- VARIOUS -- NIGHT

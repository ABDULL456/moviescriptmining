1 begins to climb up the side of the wing, using dangling 9 and 7 as a ladder. 
Perched on top of 7's staff, 1 reaches up for 8, who is crouched on the edge of the buttress. He grabs 8's hand, gesturing imperiously to 8 to pull him up. looks at 7 urgently, nodding to her. She gets it immediately and grabs 1's leg, stopping him. You fool! We can still save ourselves! 
The plane teeters down to a 90 degree angle. 5 and 6 look up at the rest of the ragdolls from farther down the wing. 5 is concerned and almost panicked. 6 is almost zen-peaceful, as though he can foresee it will be all right. 
looks around and sees the rope tied around 7's waist. 
(TO 7) Your rope. 
7 throws it down to 9 who ties it to his own waist. The plane tilts... it's hanging even more precariously now... about to fall out of the side of the Cathedral entirely... 
9 suddenly jumps down into the flames just as the plane starts to fall. 7 shouts with stress. 
The plane EXPLODES as it hits the ground, smoke rising from the crash. The rope pulls taut, and after the smoke settles we can see 9 dangling with 5 and 6. 
8 pulls the hanging chain of ragdolls up and onto the buttress fragment. 
s 1 recovers himself and straightens his hat, he glances up... towards the smouldering clock tower...

The ragdolls have come to the library. Embers from the burning cathedral drift down like burning snowflakes. 
(BROKEN-HEARTED) Oh... my sanctuary... 
The others try to avoid the embers. 9 moves purposefully towards the library. 1 stands, mourning his sanctuary. His staff is charred and ruined. He lets it drop. 8 takes 1's arm and urges him to follow the others.

SHARON Trumpet. 
As he says that, we hear our TRUMPET MUSIC begin -- a fast and furious MUTED TRUMPET, incredible RIFFS, and we use this to carry us, as we... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
Sharon is in the report room, using the computer, hunting. We MOVE AROUND to see her and the screen. She is searching the police records to find the accident. The CONTINUING TRUMPET RIFFS are the motor for this. She suddenly stops as we FOCUS ON the name: "LAMBERT." Then we watch her as she punches up the data and she reads. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. SHARON'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
We MOVE THROUGH Sharon's nearly dark apartment, its stillness in strange contrast to the manic TRUMPET RIFFS. We PAN to find her curled in a chair, staring deeply, sadly, drinking a drink. As we PAN, we DISCOVER she is looking at that mural of the mountains and through this to her thoughts, and then she makes a decision and rises and goes to the phone, punches in a number. 
INT. CATCH'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
He is sitting on his bed, back against the headboard, sitting there fully dressed, shoes and all, knees up -- as he plays his muted trumpet, hard and fast, playing the incredible riffs we've been hearing, playing in a driven way, keeping his demons away. When the RING of the PHONE breaks through, he stops suddenly. He waits. His MACHINE CLICKS ON and BEEPS. We INTERCUT the call as Sharon's voice comes on, subdued. 
SHARON Catch, it's me. Can you pick up? 
But he sits there, waiting, listening. 
SHARON Why don't we... meet tomorrow? I'll be in Westwood. Can you meet me there? Westwood and Cole. About two o'clock. Okay? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
He sits there. He slowly puts the horn down. He reaches for the phone now -- but she hangs up before he picks up the call. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WESTWOOD STREET - CORNER - NEXT DAY 
Catch waits on a busy street corner in Westwood Village not far from Santa Monica. He is waiting, glancing over the passing crowds for Sharon. He sees her. She is off duty, out of uniform. He watches her until she spots him. She smiles a little, but there is a mix of fear and sadness in her smile. They walk to each other and stop and hug, but it is brief, and then she keeps walking slowly, and he walks beside her. There is a strain lingering between them. 
CATCH Shar, I'm sorry about yesterday. I... 
SHARON That's okay. 
CATCH It's hard to explain, but it's... I'm okay now. 
SHARON You don't have to explain. 
He glances at her, wondering, walking along. 
CATCH So... why'd we meet here? 
SHARON So you're the trumpet player who was waking people up -- on my beat. 
They walk along in silence a moment. 
CATCH I used to practice late... outside. On my roof. 
SHARON On your roof? That's why we couldn't find you. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
CATCH I didn't know it bothered anybody until you mentioned it. You arresting me? 
They smile nervous smiles. She walks on, leading him somewhere. He looks about, beginning to show some agitation, but covering it. 
CATCH You going to tell me where we're going? (as she doesn't answer) That's okay. I mean... I'll go anywhere with you, Shar. Jaws of death. The mall on a Saturday. Just about any... 
He slows his steps, looking across the street and down half a block... 
HIS POV 
We see an ivy-covered brick building there, with a sign that is too far away for us to read. 
ON CATCH AND SHARON 
He looks quickly away from that building.       She sees his growing agitation. 
SHARON You can trust me, you know. 
She takes his hand. 
SHARON I've got you now. I'm holding on -- like before. 
CATCH What d'you mean? 
SHARON Like I held you before.   Like I did -- at the accident. 
He suddenly pulls his hand out of hers, shocked, and it shakes her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHARON What makes it so... unspeakable, Catch? What makes it like that?

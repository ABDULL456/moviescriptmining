Just as the beast reaches the top, it freezes, as if stuck. 
Above, the ice begins to shine brighter and brighter. 
Suddenly, the beast on top breaks apart, unfurling into planes to catch the light. This is what the contest has been about -- a better place in the sun. 
Brand takes it in. 
EXT. JUNGLE -- DAY 
Cooper and Brand pick their way their way through the foliage, which is now perfectly still, absorbing the light. Cooper looks at the plants, wary. 
Brand sees his trepidation and laughs at him. 
BRAND They're not going to move now, Cooper. They need to spread themselves as thin as they can to absorb the light. 
Cooper leads the way, pushing through the trees. 
Suddenly he stops again. Brand, annoyed, pushes through the foliage to join him. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Cooper, honestly, you're a bit of a- 
She stops. Cooper is standing at a sheer cliff. 
Spread out on the plain below is a massive, fortified base. 
INT. CHINESE FORTIFIED COLONY -- DAY 
Massive blast doors, long since smashed in, open onto a building that has been overrun by the local fractal wildlife. 
Case steps inside first, his worklights flickering on. Cooper and the others follow him in. 
INT. MESS HALL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY 
The room is barely recognizable -- the fractal life has covered the tables and chairs. Water pools on the floor and light streams in from a massive hole the fractal animals have punched in the ceiling. 
DOYLE Looks like the Chinese picked a fight with the locals. 
COOPER Looks like they lost. 
They continue through the ruins. 
INT. BARRACKS, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY 
The deeper they go, the less fractal wildlife they find. The barracks are pristine -- hundreds of perfectly made beds, waiting for colonists who never came, like one of the bunkers the federal government used to keep in case of nuclear winter. 
DOYLE Look at the size of this place. They built it for thousands of people. But no one came. 
Brand looks around, determined. 
BRAND They will. We can salvage it. This place will save us years. 
COOPER But why didn't they come? 
BRAND (SHRUGS) The Chinese government collapsed, same as ours. The people who knew about this mission probably died years ago. We had the same problems. 
Roth finds a sign he likes the look of -- it points to the science levels. 
INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY 
A massive door GRINDS open and the team steps into a massive complex of underground laboratories. 
INT. DAMAGED LAB, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY 
Cooper and the others carefully make their way through a lab that has been completely emptied -- no desks, no chairs, nothing. The only thing that remains is a solid ball of matter in the center of the room. 
BRAND What happened here? 
Roth stares at the ball, intrigued. 
ROTH They were testing something. 
Cooper looks at the walls, which are bowed inwards. 
COOPER Testing what? 
Roth is looking at the ball, which appears to have been built from layers of different material. The outermost layer is flattened steel. 
COOPER (CONT'D) (LOOKING CLOSER) Is that a chair? 
Roth looks. The outermost layer of the ball indeed looks like a steel chair, flattened with incredible force onto surface of the ball. 
Brand opens the door to the next lab. 
INT. LABORATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- NIGHT 
The lab is empty, except for a large metal sphere on a pedestal in the center of the room. A black box is set into a cavity in the sphere, wired to a control panel. 
Cooper looks at the walls of the room, which have been bowed inwards, as if some great force had been pulling from the center of the room. 
COOPER Everything in here is bolted down. (looks at sphere) What do you think this thing does? 
ROTH (EXCITED) Let's find out. 
Roth finds a control panel. Wipes off an inch of dust and begins tinkering with the controls. 
COOPER I wouldn't turn it on until we can figure out what it does, Roth. 
Roth continues to look over the controls, oblivious. 
BRAND (O.S.) Cooper. Come look at this. 
Brand calls out from the hallway. 
INT. STAIRWELL, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY 
Cooper follows Brand's voice down the stairs to a sub-basement beneath the lab level. 
INT. OBSERVATORY, CHINESE COLONY -- DAY 
Cooper steps into a huge space filled with a near perfect holographic representation of the local system. 
Cooper joins Brand and Doyle in the map, looking at the incredibly detailed models of each star. 
Case is standing at a terminal, hacking into the camp's records. 
CASE I've found the Chinese mission logs. They're encrypted. 
Cooper walks over. Looks over the terminal. 
COOPER Old military-grade encryption. It's not very robust. (looks at Case) No offense. Hang on.

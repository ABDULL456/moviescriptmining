LORENSON [Putting the pieces together] He got a little shock. [To himself] And it's reset him. Not permanently probably...but at least for a little while. They use it on epileptic patients sometimes... 
TALIA But he's not epileptic. 
LORENSON No, but he is having seizures. 
TALIA looks at LORENSON. She's still confused. LORENSON's merely surprised. 
INT. STARKS' ROOM, ICU UNIT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 
STARKS looks up from his PAPER -- now covered in WORDS -- to see Dr. Lorenson in the doorway. STARKS still looks weak but much better than before. 
STARKS It worked, didn't it? 
LORENSON nods. 
STARKS This is really happening, isn't it? 
DR. LORENSON [Beat] What do you need me to do? 
STARKS [Beat] Thank you. 
STARKS folds the LETTER. 
STARKS I need to get this letter to someone. 
DR. LORENSON I can't take you out of here in your condition... 
STARKS And I can't stay here in my condition. I am going to die tonight. It's already been decided. 
DR. LORENSON No, it hasn't. 
STARKS Yes. [Beat] It has. Everything up 'till today is done. Everything starting with tomorrow is up for grabs. 
EXT. PARKING LOT, ALPINE GROVE, 1992 
LORENSON helps STARKS into the parking lot as it snows. 
INT. LORENSON'S CAR, DAY, 1992 
LORENSON and STARKS are driving on the same, now familiar highway. 
STARKS You know how to get there? 
LORENSON Sure. It's an easy address. A little far out there, but easy enough. 
STARKS Good. 
Bob Dylan plays on the RADIO. STARKS smiles as he hears him and turns the music up; the act is sad because, as LORENSON notices, it belongs to someone with an interest to live. 
EXT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992 
DR. LORENSON and STARKS drive up to Jean and Jackie's house. 
LORENSON You want me to come with you? 
STARKS No, I'll be ok. 
STARKS slowly makes his way to their front door and knocks on it as best as he can. The sound, however, is still understandably soft. 
STARKS waits and then reaches for the knob on the door. He opens it and looks inside. We first see his face, and the devastation on it, as we guess the sight he's laid eyes on. 
JACKIE is sitting at the kitchen table, still only 7 years old. Though STARKS expected it, he falters under the disappointment of seeing a girl he liked instead of the woman he loved. As she looks up at him, it's all he can do not to break down. 
STARKS Hi. 
JACKIE [Surprised] Hey. [Beat] I remember you. 
STARKS I remember you, too. 
STARKS shakes his head, looking at her. She looks beautiful, and still hopeful. Her life lays ahead of her and her fate -- when he found her in 2004 -- remains as distant as possible from this innocent, still promising image. 
STARKS Jackie, how have you been? 
JACKIE smiles; she doesn't get asked that often. 
JACKIE I've been ok. 
STARKS Good. How's your mom? 
JACKIE Ok, I guess. 
STARKS nods. JACKIE smiles. It's all he can do not to crumble. 
STARKS Do you think I could see her? She looks at him and senses, like kids do, the desperation in his eyes. 
JACKIE Sure. 
JACKIE calls out for Jean, then runs up the stairs to get her. LORENSON has gotten out of the car and is waiting outside on the porch. STARKS remains in the doorway.

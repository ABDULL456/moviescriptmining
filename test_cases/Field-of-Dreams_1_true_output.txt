MANN I didn't do it just because I don't want the publicity. 
RAY Then what else? 
MANN I envy you your craziness, Ray. It's been years since I did something completely crazy. 
RAY Well, you want to hear something really crazy? 
MANN Do I have a choice? 
RAY Nope. I live on a farm in Iowa. One day, out in the cornfield, I heard a voice... 
89 EXT. CAR 
It glides through city traffic. 
90 EXT. FENWAY PARK - DAY 
Ray slides the Datsun into a parking place, and he and Mann walk the short sleazy block to Fenway, and old-fashioned center-city ballpark.

90 CONTINUED 90 
MANN 
(SHAKING HIS 
HEAD) But can't you accept the probability that it's all just a hallucination? 
RAY Annie and Karin see it, too. They have reached the ticket window. 
RAY Two, field level, first base side. The elderly Ticket Seller pulls out two tickets. 
TICKET SELLER Section seventeen. Twelve dollars. Ray takes out his wallet and turns to Mann.. 
RAY It's on me. 
MANN You're damn right it is. Ray pays the man and receives the tickets. 
TICKET SELLER Game don't start for a while, but you can go in, watch batting practice. 
RAY Great. They enter the stadium. 
91 INT. STADIUM 91 
They walk through the indoor portion of the grandstand toward their section. 
RAY So what do you do with yourself these days? 
MANN I live. I work. I've learned to cook. I take walks. I watch sunsets. 
RAY Don't you miss being... involved?

91 CONTINUED 91 
MANN 
(SNORTS) I was the East Coast distributor of 'involved.'. I ate it, drank it, and breathed it. Then they killed Martin. They killed Bobby. And then they elected Tricky Dick. Twice. And now, people like you think I must be miserable that I'm not involved anymore. Well, I've got news for you: I spent all my misery years ago. I have no more pain for any of you. I gave at the office. They approach the refreshment stand. 
RAY So...what do you want? 
. MANN I want them to stop looking to me for answers. Begging me to speak again, write again, be a leader. I want them to start thinking for themselves. And I want my privacy! Ray looks slightly embarrassed. 
RAY No, I meant what do you want from... Ray points to the hot dog vendor, as they have reached the front of the line. 
MANN Oh. 
(LAUGHS AT 
HIMSELF) A dog and a beer. 
RAY (to the vendor) Two. 
(TO MANN) Okay, I agree, you should be entitled to as much privacy as you wane. But why stop writing? 
MANN I haven't published a word in seventeen years and I still have to endure assholes like you all the time. What do you think it'd be like if I suddenly came out with a new book?

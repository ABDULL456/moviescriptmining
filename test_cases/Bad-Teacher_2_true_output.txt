PRINCIPAL SNUR Elizabeth, thanks again for hopping in last minute. You really saved us. 
ELIZABETH Is Amy going to be okay? 
PRINCIPAL SNUR She'll be fine. But to be honest, I think she was scaring some of the kids. 
ELIZABETH I bet, I bet. Well, let her know she's in my thoughts. 
ANGLE ON Amy watching from outside her car. One side of her face is completely blistered, scaly and red from the POISON IVY. The kids have every reason to be scared by her. She gets into her car and slams the door. 
AMY (banging on steering wheel) Fudge! Fudge! Fudge! Fuuuuuck--dge! 
INT. LUXURY BUS - DAY 
Kids sing BUS SONGS. Elizabeth and Scott sit up front. 
KIDS 
(SINGING) Hey, Sasha! Hey, Sasha! 
SASHA I think I hear it again! 
KIDS You're wanted on the telephone! 
SASHA 
(POINTING) If it's not Chase, then I'm not home! Chase rolls her eyes. Up front, Scott and Elizabeth sit next to one another and share ipod buds. 
ELIZABETH (nodding to the beat) You guys are amazing. Period 5 is definitely going to make it. Scott smiles wide. Garrett walks up the aisle. He looks at Elizabeth, then turns to Scott. 
GARRETT Mr. Delacourte, do you think we could go to the poetry museum? 
SCOTT Oh, um, I don't know, Champ, um -- Scott looks to Elizabeth, like "please help." 
ELIZABETH (to Garrett, supersweet) Oh, honey, I bet everyone would just love to walk around and look at all the poetry on the walls, but unfortunately, the itinerary's really tight. 
GARRETT Why are you talking like that? 
ELIZABETH Just go sit down, sweetie. Garrett gives her an annoyed look and then heads back to his seat. Scott smiles at Elizabeth. 
SCOTT Wow, you are such a natural. 
ELIZABETH When you love what you do, it comes easy. 
INT. JOHN ADAMS MIDDLE SCHOOL - HALLWAY - NIGHT 
A splotchy-faced Amy trudges down the hallway. She passes Elizabeth's room, stops, walks back to the door and peers in. She looks down the hallway -- it's empty. 
INT. ELIZABETH'S CLASSROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Amy rifles through Elizabeth's desk. She opens the top drawer. Just pens and paper. She tries the bottom drawer. Locked. Shishkebabs! 
INT. EMPTY HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Amy drags ELIZABETH'S DESK across the hallway into her room. It's a slow, difficult and loud process. 
INT. EMPTY HALLWAY - LATER 
Amy, sweating, now drags HER OWN DESK across the.hallway into Elizabeth's room. She stops to catch her breath. 
CUT TO: 
INT. AMY'S CLASSROOM - THE NEXT DAY 
Amy watches as the MAINTENANCE GUY sorts through his keys and tries to unlocks the desk. 
AMY (nervous, too loud) I never lose my keys!

CUT TO: 
EXT.  BENZ' HOUSE -- DAY 
Nick sits in the passenger seat of Greg's car, glancing across the street at... 
ALEX 
She's standing on the front porch of Benz' house, talking with his MOM. Mom is currently shaking her head.  Alex turns away and heads back towards Nick.  She comes around the Skylark and pulls open her door. 
NICK Well? 
ALEX She thought Benz was at school. 
Alex remains calm.  She sits for a moment, staring ahead. Finally she puts the key in the ignition. 
NICK Where to now? 
ALEX Laurie's. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  LAURIE'S HOUSE -- DAY 
Alex pulls the Skylark into Laurie's driveway.  The house is run down. You wouldn't want to live here.  Above, the sky has clouded over.  It looks like it's going to get nasty. 
ALEX Come on. 
Nick follows Alex to the front door and Alex hits the buzzer. 
ALEX (to herself) Laurie...answer...come on... 
Alex tries the buzzer again.  Persistently. 
ALEX Shit. 
Alex looks close to cracking.  There's a desperation in her face. 
ALEX This is like a movie or something.  I mean, am I paranoid or what? 
NICK It doesn't necessarily mean she's... 
ALEX (cutting him off) Let's go around back. 
Before Nick can stop her, Alex is running around to the back. 
EXT.  LAURIE'S HOUSE, BACK PORCH -- DAY 
The backyard is in a sorry state, with junk strewn everywhere.  There's a cannibalized car, piles of scrap wood, and a swing-set that's hopelessly rusted. 
Alex winds her way to the back porch and a set of dusty glass doors.  She steps up and clears a spot to look through. 
ALEX (visibly relieved) She's here! 
Nick joins her at the window, peering inside. 
THEIR P.O.V. 
They are looking into a cluttered living room, dark except for the light that's issuing from the television.  The television faces away from us, but we can see Laurie, siting in front of it, mesmerized. 
LAURIE 
She looks like shit.  Wan, with sunken eyes and mussed up hair.  Mascara has run down her cheeks, and even now, tears are trickling from her eyes. Yet despite this, there's a dazed smile on her face.  We can't hear her, but she seems to be talking to the television. 
ALEX 
steps back a moment, concerned. 
ALEX It is the game. 
She taps on the window. 
ALEX Laurie! 
INSIDE, 
Laurie continues to watch the screen, oblivious to the rest of the world. 
Alex TAPS the harder, using her fist now. 
ALEX (louder) LAURIE! 
Nick joins Alex now, and the two of them are banging on the glass. There's no way in hell Laurie wouldn't be able to hear them. 
Alex steps back from the window again, panicking.

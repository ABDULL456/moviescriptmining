{"train": "A MOST VIOLENT YEAR \nWritten by \nJ.C. Chandor \nThis film is set in New York City, 1981: \nMurders: 2,228 \nForcible Rape: 5,405 \nViolent Crime: 180,235 \nAggravated Assault: 60,329 \nProperty: 1,029,749 \nVehicle Theft: 133,041 \nRobbery: 112,273 \nBurglary: 360,925 \nLarceny-Theft: 535,783 \nCrime Index: 1,209,984 \n1981 was the most violent year in NYC history as recorded by overall Crime Index in relation to population. \nJANUARY 31, 1981 Over black we hear the opening of a garage door. The light spills in and we see. \nEXT. UPPER MIDDLE CLASS RESIDENTIAL HOUSE, QUEENS NYC - SUNRISE \nOpen on ABEL MORALES. It is early morning and still almost dark out. He has a rugged yet prosperously-handsome face and is in his mid-thirties. He is struggling to get started with his morning jog. \nEXT. SHIP GRAVEYARD, STATEN ISLAND NYC - DAY \nIt is early morning. A large bulk fuel oil transport truck sits idling next to a decrepit old dock. The dock sticks into a backwater section of New York harbor that is filled with the decaying remains of half-sunken abandoned barges and tug boats. \nJULIAN, the young driver of the truck sits and nervously scans the horizon. Eventually a large fuel barge appears in the distance being pushed by a tug boat. The barge is steered past the skeletons of the other sunken ships and makes its way to the dock in front of the tanker truck. \nJULIAN gets out of his truck and readies a large connecting hose. He looks around nervously. JULIAN steps across the broken boards of the dock and struggles to get the hose to the barge. He hands it to the BARGE OPERATOR with a nod of the head and no words. \nThey connect the hose and start a large generator as it begins to pump fuel into the truck. They both scan the horizon again as the sun begins to come up. \nEXT. MORE INDUSTRIAL QUEENS NEIGHBORHOOD- SAME TIME \nABEL is still jogging as the light begins to increase. It is freezing out. He is a very serious guy. He is not happy that he is out of shape. Finally he stops and bends over to catch his breath. We have run with him from the nicer part of the neighborhood to a rougher section. As he catches his breath he stands up and looks around. He is unsure of his feelings. \nINT. ANNA'S DRESSING AREA The camera slowly moves in as ANNA sits in a slip at her make up table putting on her face for the day ahead. She looks into the mirror as if she is putting on a coat of armor. \nINT. DRIVER'S CAB OF A BULK OIL TRANSPORT TRUCK - DAY \nSTANDARD HEATING OIL, \"We set the Standard\" is written in logo form on the side of the tank. \nThe truck idles in traffic waiting to pay the toll to cross the Verrazano bridge that spans the mouth of New York harbor. \nJULIAN, the young driver from the dock, cautiously looks around as the traffic inches along. He finally approaches the toll booth and pays. \nJULIAN Good morning. \nJULIAN speaks English with a well-sanded accent. Is it Central American or Mexican? The female collector gives him a smile. He heads through the booth, but there is still traffic on the other side as the lanes merge together. Just as the traffic is about to pick up he looks in his rearview mirror and we see TWO GUYS come walking through the traffic and towards the cab. Before we know it they are climbing up the cab steps. \nThe GUY on the driver's side, LOUIS SERVIDIO, is small and very slight but he moves with great speed and strength. He shatters the glass side window with his elbow. Unlocks the door just as his partner, THUG #2, does the same thing on the passenger side, but he is holding a gun. They are not wearing masks. It's very brazen. \nBefore THUG #2 even asks JULIAN to get out of the cab LOUIS SERVIDIO crushes him in the jaw with three swift punches then pulls him out of the cab and down onto the roadway. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO pulls the door shut and they drive away with the truck leaving JULIAN sitting in the middle of the road staring, as blood starts to flow from his jaw. \nINT. PARKING YARD OF STANDARD HEATING OIL- SAME TIME \nTwo almost-matching late model Mercedes pull up to a chain- link gate with a small sign that says \"STANDARD HEATING OIL: WE SET THE STANDARD\". The DISPATCHER opens the gate. \nThey both pull into reserved parking spaces next to each other. ABEL is dressed in a very tasteful custom made suit. ABEL's wife ANNA was driving the car behind him. She is a beautiful, tall, blonde woman dressed to the nines but with a streak in her eye that this is all business. You would not want to cross this woman. \nABEL Ready? ANNA Yes. \nABEL You look very nice. \nANNA Thank you. \nJOSEPH And you have brought the money? (ABEL nodes yes) So you realize you have only thirty days to close this transaction? (MORE) \nJOSEPH (CONT'D) No extensions, no... contingencies whatsoever. ABEL I understand. \nJOSEPH I want you to know this up front. I am a very fair man but I believe in honoring contracts. You will fulfill your end of this contract and the property is yours. If you can't we will keep your money and will sell it to your competitor who has been chasing us almost as badly as you have. I like you, but know that the only reason I am choosing you is because of the favorable terms of this contract. So this is business... and when you sign this.... \nABEL I understand. \nJOSEPH Well then, let's see this money, and then I will sign these papers. \nABEL turns to ANDREW and gives a slight nod. ANDREW pulls the black briefcase onto the table and opens it. It has seven hundred thousand dollars in cash in it. He slides it over to their side. The old man signs the contract and they shake hands. \nEXT. MASSIVE OIL TANK FARM PARKING LOT - DAY \nABEL stands next to ANDREW's car. \nANDREW WALSH Congratulations. \nABEL It's not ours yet. \nANDREW WALSH Well, it was a hell of a job just getting them to this point. It's a good day for us. Take a walk around. Enjoy it for a second. \nANDREW gets in his car and drives away. ABEL looks around and decides to go for a little walk. \nHe heads out towards the tanks and walks among them. They tower seven stories above him. As he walks, he is cut off like a maze from any other visual input. (Similar to being inside a Richard Serra sculpture) Finally he emerges into some light and as ABEL looks up the camera reveals his view. It's midtown Manhattan in all its glory, just across the East River from the site. He stares at the city and we see the true depths of his ambition lock on his face. He looks to his watch. \nINT. 1981 MERCEDES 500 SEC \nABEL drives away from New York City. We see it behind his head. \nINT. CAR ON MERRITT PARKWAY \nThe terrain turns to upscale country. \nEXT. COUNTRY HOUSE - DAY \nABEL's car drives into a long driveway through the woods. Then an architect-designed, 80's modern house, still under construction, appears. He pulls up in front. \nHe gets out of the car and stands there looking at the large house. He walks into the house and we see more clearly that it is nearing completion. It is empty. \nINT. 80'S MODERN HOUSE - DAY \nABEL walks over to the massive floor-to-ceiling windows and stands looking over the large pond that sits down the hill from the house. As he stares out his CONTRACTOR comes quietly walking in behind him. \nCONTRACTOR Hello? \nABEL There he is. \nHe walks up behind him and they both look out in silence for a beat. \nABEL (CONT'D) You have done a beautiful job here. \nCONTRACTOR Thank you. \nABEL I mean it. You and your men should be very proud. \nCONTRACTOR We are. \nABEL Most people don't have anything beautiful like this to show for their day's work. You are a lucky man. \nCONTRACTOR I am. \nABEL Well I thank you... my family will be very happy here. \nCONTRACTOR I hope so. \nABEL Now I think I owe you some money. CONTRACTOR That may be true. \nABEL It is. \nABEL reaches into his jacket pocket and takes out a thick envelope of cash. As he does we see a transformation of his personality from pleasant philosopher to a direct voice of unquestioned authority. \nABEL (CONT'D) This is the seventeen outstanding. But we are arriving here in four days. It must be done. \nCONTRACTOR Yes. \nABEL Well, I'll let you go. \nHe says this as he leads him to the door. \nABEL (CONT'D) And the tile in the master bath... \nHe watches her walk away then looks back into the hospital room. He enters. \nINT. HOSPITAL EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY \nABEL walks into the room and looks at JULIAN. He looks up and ABEL has trouble putting it to words. \nABEL I have to get going. \nJULIAN gives a nod. ABEL (CONT'D) Can we get you anything? \nNods no. \nABEL (CONT'D) We'll pick you up when they let you out of here. \nThey look at each other. \nABEL (CONT'D) These men are cowards. Too weak to make a living... or even fight with their own hands, and too stupid to think up anything else to do. \nFinally he turns and leaves. \nEXT. ABANDONED RACETRACK PARKING LOT - QUEENS NY - DAY \nABEL drives up to the drop off scene. There is the large bulk transport truck and one lone police car just sitting in the middle of the parking lot. \nABEL gets out, walks up, and stops to stare at the truck. A young beat cop is sitting on the hood of his car waiting. ABEL May I take it? \nBEAT COP Excuse me? \nABEL May I take it now? \nBEAT COP Is it yours? \nABEL Yes. \nBEAT COP Well, I'm sorry about that. Once the owner or an owner's representative files the claim form in Corona she's yours... again. \nABEL So you guys have done what you needed to? \nBEAT COP Yes. \nABEL And what was that? \nBEAT COP I'm sorry? \nABEL You just said you've done what you needed to... so what was it that you've done? \nBEAT COP (looks back dumbfounded) \nABEL Did you fingerprint or anything? \nBEAT COP No need, these guys always wear gloves. \nABEL So you've done nothing. \nBEAT COP I'm not exactly sure, I just got here at four. My shift is actually up. \nABEL So who's coming? \nThey stare at each other, then the truck. ABEL then climbs up and we see he knows his way around the truck. He goes up top and opens and looks into a valve, the tank is empty. \nBEAT COP Sorry. \nThe cop gets in his car and prepares to drive away. \nBEAT COP (CONT'D) Why did they want it? \nABEL They stole the $6,000 of fuel that was in it. \nThe cop leaves. ABEL is left standing on top of the truck in the parking lot alone with his battered truck. He looks down at the open loading valve and begins to come up with an idea. The sun is setting. \nEXT. STANDARD HEATING TRUCK YARD - DAY \nA sign on the inside of the gate reads. \"It's not safety first... It's safety always\". The motor on the gate starts in and it opens. In drives ABEL'S car. \nINT. ANNA'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY \nANNA is working away on an adding machine in her office. She is listening to the radio that sits behind her on the desk. We can see that she is in her comfort zone. \nINT. BROOKLYN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe ASSISTANT D.A. is sitting behind his desk as DEPUTY LANGE stands off to the side. He is only in his early thirties but with confidence and ego to spare. They know each other. \nAll six raise a glass. \nABEL (CONT'D) A toast to our new home. It's as beautiful as my wife and daughters and as strong as me...(kids laugh) May we be happy, prosperous and safe here. Cheers. \nINT. GYMNASIUM GIRLS YOUTH SOCCER GAME - NEXT MORNING \nABEL is standing watching the game as he waits for his coffee to come out of the snack bar. Over his shoulder we hear... \nPETER FORENTE So you made the move? \nABEL turns and sees PETER FORENTE standing there. He's in his mid-forties, very well-dressed, and handsomely bald. \nABEL Peter... it's official as of yesterday. \nCOUNTER PERSON Sir. ABEL picks up his coffee, and they both walk back over to the sideline together. Although they are standing a bit off to the side from everyone else. \nPETER FORENTE So I heard about your rig getting picked off again. ABEL Yes. \nPETER FORENTE We should probably get together to discuss this and go over some of the preventative measures that we've been taking. We haven't had an incident since November. It doesn't do any of us any good to have this kind of attention brought to us. \nThey both stare out at the court for beat. PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) So I think I may have seen one of your new trucks the other day. \nThey look at each other. \nPETER FORENTE (CONT'D) Out near here, at the Miller Road diner? \nABEL That's possible. \nPETER FORENTE The driver looked like a member of the Hitler Youth. I haven't seen a teamster that blond and blue-eyed since I was a kid. \nABEL He's from Ohio. Played football. I like my drivers to fit in with the neighborhood... \nPETER FORENTE That's new territory for you, no? \nThis brings them both back in to look at each other. \nABEL Just picked up a few new accounts over there. Weekend houses of some old clients from in the city. \nPETER gives a bit of a stronger look. Then finally turns back towards the field. \nPETER FORENTE Which one is yours? ABEL Right there. \nThey look out. \nPETER FORENTE She's beautiful. \nABEL Thank you. \nPETER FORENTE Welcome to the neighborhood. You should be proud. ABEL Proud? \nPETER FORENTE Yes. \nINT. GARAGE OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY \nThe garage is filled with boxes. ABEL stands in the middle of a few that are partially unpacked. He has set up an old radio in the corner of the garage, and it is playing a New York Giants football game. ABEL takes an object out of one of the boxes and looks at it with significance. \nComing from the main house we hear the doorbell ring. ABEL'S oldest daughter, ANNIE, comes to the door of the garage. \nANNIE Dad. Mr. Walsh is here. \nABEL looks around behind ANNIE to see ANDREW standing there. He waves him into the garage. The boxes are stacked almost to the ceiling around them. \nANDREW WALSH I'm sorry for the dramatic drop in but your phone doesn't seem to be working. \nABEL It's not set up yet... So I am guessing this isn't good news here on a Sunday night. ANDREW WALSH No... It looks like they are coming after us. \nABEL That describes many people at this point. \nSlight smile. \nANDREW WALSH The D.A. \nABEL How bad? ANDREW WALSH I still haven't seen it yet. But my guy in his office just gave me a heads up an hour ago. It's not good. \nABEL Where are we exposed? \nANDREW WALSH I'm not sure, a couple places probably. \nABEL A couple places? \nThis hits ABEL. He thinks for a beat than goes over to the door to the house and calls for his wife. \nShe drops the mail. And goes right up to her daughter. CATHERINE Mommy. \nAs ANNA comes up to CATHERINE we now see that the little girl is holding a large very real looking handgun in her little hands. ANNA is besides herself. \nANNA Where did you get this? Catherine where did you find this? \nCATHERINE Right here. \nThe little girl points over towards the bushes near the side door where LOUIS SERVIDIO was hiding and got hit the night before. \nANNA Show me. \nThe little girl walks over to bushes and kneels down. \nCATHERINE It was just sitting right here. \nANNA turns to the middle daughter, ELIZABETH. \nANNA Did you see this? ELIZABETH Yeah, she went under there to get that ball and came out with it. \nANNA Maria! ANNA yells towards in the house. \nELIZABETH What is it? \nANNA walks towards the front door to retrieve the NANNY MARIA. \nANNA Maria! \nELIZABETH Mom, is it real? \nINT. ABEL'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY ABEL is sitting down at his desk. ANNA comes to the door. She gets his attention and then walks right up to the desk. She puts the handgun down right in front of him. \nABEL What is that? \nANNA A gun... It's a gun Abel. \nABEL Where did you get it? \nANNA Your youngest daughter found it in the bushes outside our front door. She was playing with it. \nABEL is totally speechless. \nANNA (CONT'D) It's loaded... with the safety off. \nThis sits like a bomb in the room. \nANNA (CONT'D) Those weren't kids looking to rip off our TV Abel, that was a fucking goon with a loaded gun looking in our windows! What the hell is going on here? \nABEL Let me see that. I'll take care of this. ANNA Damn right we will. Who is this? \nABEL I don't know, but I will take care of it. \nANNA What does that mean you will take care of it. This isn't a brick through our car window or some other cute little warning that I've put up with in the past. This is your daughter playing with a loaded gun! He turns back quickly. And stares at her. \nABEL (YELLS) I know what it is! \nHe slowly walks back across the room and picks up the gun. His hand shows a shake ever so slightly as he touches it. \nABEL (CONT'D) Let me deal with this. \nANNA You better. Because you won't like what's going to happen once I start getting involved. \nThis causes him to stop in his tracks. He turns very seriously. \nABEL You are not to tell your father about this. \nShe looks back at him with a tinge of a smile. \nABEL (CONT'D) Do you hear me. ANNA'S look changes and she understands. \nANNA ...I won't. \nANDREW comes to the door and knocks. ANDREW WALSH Can I talk with you both? \nANNA I found a gun outside our front door. Somebody left it there last night. \nANDREW WALSH Who? \nABEL I don't know. \nANNA looks over to ANDREW letting him know her disgust. ANDREW WALSH Well... \nBILL O'LEARY It will stop immediately. \nABEL No, it won't. \nHe resets, again. BILL O'LEARY You seem to be under pressure from many sides right now... which I understand. Trust me I understand. So let me think this through. But whatever decision I make on this, it stands. Those men show up every morning for you because I tell them to. It's important for you to realize that these are very dangerous times, and we need to adapt. It's not like when we were driving. \nABEL Yes. \nBILL O'LEARY Sometimes the weak man is the stronger man if he has the right tools. \nABEL It may seem that way... but if you are weak eventually it will show... it always does. And if you want this to all be behind us, help me find out who is doing this. You know a lot of people, and that would be the most help to me. \nBILL O'LEARY It's not always as simple as it appears. \nABEL I'm sure that's true. \nBILL O'LEARY It is... well, I got to get going. \nABEL Thank you for coming Bill. \nEXT. GATE AT STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY \nO'LEARY walks over to ANDREW as he is getting in his car. \nANDREW WALSH How did that go? \nBILL O'LEARY Not well. ANDREW WALSH He feels very strongly about this. \nBILL O'LEARY I can see that. \nANDREW WALSH I don't think he fully understands it. \nBILL O'LEARY What's to understand? \nANDREW WALSH It's illegal. \nBILL O'LEARY It's not illegal if I say it isn't. My responsibility is to provide safe and timely passage of goods and products into and around this city. And because of this situation it is appearing to those whose opinions I care about that I can't do my job. That can not and will not continue. \nANDREW WALSH I understand. \nBILL O'LEARY So talk to him. You need to protect yourself. This is very serious. Just know that. \nANDREW thinks this through. \nANDREW WALSH How would this work? \nBILL O'LEARY What does that mean? \nANDREW WALSH I guess I'm not even sure exactly what you are suggesting. \nBILL O'LEARY Are you kidding me with this? \nANDREW WALSH No. BILL O'LEARY Every driver in your fleet gets a handgun. \nANDREW WALSH And a permit? O'LEARY nods yes. \nANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) When? \nBILL O'LEARY By Friday. \nANDREW WALSH Are the permits legit? \nBILL O'LEARY That depends what they do with it. If they kill their wife with them, then no. Then that is a very fake permit, and I'll walk away very quickly. But they just need to show that they are defending themselves, and this will stop. \nANDREW WALSH Who is it? \nBILL O'LEARY I don't fucking know... \nANDREW WALSH I'll talk to him. \nINT. MORALES' GARAGE - DAY \nANNA is struggling through the boxes in the garage. She moves some things and then finds what she is looking for. A pile of about nine matching file boxes that are all labeled the same. It is their off the books bookkeeping. \nINT. STUDY/LIBRARY OF THE NEW HOUSE - DAY \nThe library is filled with custom made bookshelves that are still waiting to be filled. There is a large desk sitting in the corner that hasn't been fully unpacked yet. \nANNA comes in struggling carrying the file boxes from the garage, she piles them on the desk. She looks around her feet at the pile, it's literally the skeletons from her closet. She resets, walks over to the window to look out over her new beautiful home. Then she turns back at the pile of boxes that hold their past and their future. \nEXT. LONG SUBURBAN DRIVEWAY - DAY \nANDREW WALSH How was your talk? (nothing) I spoke with him after. He's going to keep going `til he gets the answer he's looking for. \nABEL I said I wouldn't do it. They sit for a long beat. \nANDREW WALSH I'm not sure we are in a position to say that. \nABEL What's that? \nANDREW looks around. He's getting paranoid. \nANDREW WALSH Do you want to go for a walk? \nABEL Are you really serious with this, this is what it's come to, walking around outside like fucking gangsters? \nANDREW WALSH I am and it is. \nEXT. STANDARD HEATING OIL TRUCK - DAY Throughout this conversation ABEL is walking over to a section of the yard where WORKERS are loading some sort of additive chemical to the fuel trucks. \nANDREW WALSH It is looking like we must do this. \nABEL I must? \nThis gets a little personal. \nANDREW WALSH They will shut you down. \nABEL These men, they work for me. These trucks they drive, the customers they serve. They are here because we built this. \nANDREW WALSH That's true, until its not. And the last person in the world right now that we need working against us is the president of the fucking teamsters. This company is out of business in a month if he gets these guys to walk. We are running out of cash. \nABEL What are you even talking about here? \nANDREW WALSH The union provides a handgun and a permit to every one of the drivers. And they think this whole thing is over in a week. \nABEL These men are fucking truck drivers. This is insane. You know who is gonna get it in the end here, me. This comes back to me. \nANDREW WALSH It does either way. \nABEL I'm not doing it. \nANDREW WALSH Would you put everything at risk to stand by that. \nABEL thinks this through. \nABEL It will be the end of everything I have worked for. If one of these guys shoots somebody it's me they will bring down for it...I'll talk to him... And we need to close this deal. We can't stay like this any longer. We must close on that property... We are so weak right now. \nThey are now standing on top of one of the trucks tanks as a worker pours the additive into the tank. The container says \"GREEN DYE #7\" on it. ABEL looks down as it flows in. \nHe stands up and looks out across the fence at the container property. \nANDREW WALSH Why do you want this so badly? ABEL Because I have my entire savings at risk with this deposit. It is everything. \nANDREW WALSH That's not what I mean. Why did you want it so badly in the first place? It was a risk... always. \nABEL thinks this through. \nABEL I don't know. \nANDREW WALSH You don't know? Have you ever thought about it? \nABEL I've thought about it every day for the last five years. This place was sitting over that fence mocking.... \nANDREW WALSH I didn't mean have you ever thought about that place... (MORE) \nANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) I mean have you ever thought why you want it so badly? ABEL I don't know what you mean. \nABEL looks to him in a sincere way wanting him to answer but ANDREW just waits. Finally. \nABEL (CONT'D) I know what you are asking and no... I never ask myself why I do this. It just feels right... wanting to be bigger feels better. It feels right. \nANDREW WALSH That's very simple. \nABEL Yes... \nWith this he gives him a deadly serious look. \nABEL (CONT'D) ...It is. ANDREW WALSH You take these risks... \nABEL Only when necessary. \nANDREW WALSH We have to get going, we need them to show up. \nABEL comes down the hall carrying file boxes and brings them out onto the deck. ANNA comes out onto the deck as he is looking over the edge. \nANNA Where are you going? ABEL Bring the last few out. \nANNA You've got three minutes. \nABEL What's going on out there. \nANNA Our guests are leaving. \nABEL tries to speak but can only shake his head. Finally he jumps over the edge and she starts handing boxes down to him. He then stops again. \nABEL Do we even need to be doing this? What exactly are we hiding here? \nShe thinks this through. \nANNA I don't want them going through all this before I've had a chance to. \nEXT. GROUND BELOW DECK \nThe camera is now on the ground level with ABEL. \nABEL Is that the last one. Get back out there. \nABEL looks around for a place to stash them. \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nABEL exhales then takes three of the boxes and sneaks off into the woods. We follow him as he struggles. Finally he gets to a small clearing and starts to stack them. \nEXT. FRONT LAWN - DAY \nANNA is standing out front trying to hand out goody bags and to maintain pleasantries with the parents as they leave. \nANNA Thank you for coming. Here you go. Bye, Rebecca. Thanks. I'm sorry. Bye. \nWhen the last one goes she looks up at the ASST. DA to give him the all-clear. But as she does she gives him a look that could kill. The police file into the house in front of her. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH THE DECK - DAY \nABEL has placed the load of file boxes underneath the deck and is putting the last one in place. He sits down on the pile and looks out into the woods in sadness. \nINT. MAIN LIVING/DINING ROOM OF MORALES HOUSE \nANNA is looking around the house as the cops search through everything. She seems oddly calm. She decides that they are being respectful and heads out into the driveway. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY ANNA walks outside and stands, waiting. LAWRENCE comes out of the house and stands near her. They wait. \nANNA This is probably one that you are going to regret. \nLAWRENCE looks at her trying to figure her out. \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE Excuse me? \nANNA My husband is a very honorable man. Coming on a Saturday? It's very aggressive. \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE This is standard. \nANNA Really? I know you think you are just doing your job. But we are not what you think we are. And you have embarrassed him in front of his family and friends. \nShe gives him a long, almost scary look. \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE I think I know your father. ANNA Good for you. My husband is not my father. Not even close. So if I were you I would start treating us with a little more respect or he'll make it our only mission to ruin you. This was very disrespectful... and you are not going to find a fucking thing. \nWith that she walks back towards the house as the POLICE start filing out. \nINT. ABEL'S OFFICE - MORNING \nABEL is sitting at his desk looking out the window as the trucks come and go. As he looks across the lot he sees JULIAN coming walking across towards the locker room. A smile crosses ABEL'S face. \nINT. STANDARD HEATING OIL HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS As ABEL comes out into the hallway SALES STUDENT ALEX is walking by his door. ABEL stops to check in. \nABEL Hey, how are you? \nSALES STUDENT ALEX Good. A bit nervous. I'm heading out on my first calls alone today. \nABEL You'll do great. Remember... When you get them there. Hold the eye contact longer than you would like... but you watch what happens. \nHe gives him a big smile and a pat on the back and sends him on his way. \nABEL (CONT'D) Good luck. \nHUSBAND It's just outside on the other side of this wall here. \nMRS. ROSE I'm going to head up. Can I get you something to drink? Coffee... tea? \nThe KID gives himself an ever-so-tiny smile. SALES STUDENT ALEX Tea would be great. \nThe man walks over to a back basement door and opens it. He ushers the SALES KID through. \nHUSBAND Please. \nI/E. DOORWAY OZONE PARK BASEMENT - DAY \nAs the SALES KID goes through the door a massive fist of SOMEONE who has been waiting on the other side of the door comes swinging into frame and pounds the side of our KID'S head. Knocking him out instantly. \nINT. TRUCK CAB, 59TH STREET BRIDGE RAMP - DAY \nJULIAN is close to getting off the bridge and is starting to feel better. Just as the traffic in front of him starts to clear up, out of the corner of his eye he sees something. In his side-view mirror he sees LOUIS SERVIDIO getting out of a random car behind him. His heart starts racing. He looks over in the other mirror and there is THUG #2 walking up. Again. \nJULIAN thinks for a second then reaches for the CB RADIO. \nJULIAN Cathy! They are coming again. Over. Help. Help. On Bridge. \nHe then fumbles the CB and it drops to the floor of the cab. He looks up into the mirrors again and sees that they are still coming for him. \nThe camera now comes in tight on his face and he pauses for a long second, and he then makes his decision. He reaches under his seat and takes out a handgun. He doesn't really seem to know what he is doing with it. \nBut he opens the door of the truck and gets out. He aims the gun at LOUIS SERVIDIO walking towards him. LOUIS SERVIDIO sees him and is very surprised and stops. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO Whoa, whoa, whoa! Take it easy there. \nHe glances over at THUG #2. JULIAN Get the fuck away from me! \nLOUIS SERVIDIO Okay, man. \nPeople in the cars behind the truck are starting to honk. Then LOUIS SERVIDIO gives a nod signal to THUG #2 who is on the other side of the truck, and JULIAN'S gun fires by mistake. It totally misses THUG #2. He jumps out of the way and is hiding behind the wheel. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Watch it now, man. You're going to hurt someone. \nJULIAN is now in a total state of panic. He is hiding back in front of the truck. The three men are basically doing a slow- motion, very stressful hide-and-seek around the truck. The two THUGS now have their guns out. \nThe honking has now reached a total insane level as traffic is backing up. Then THUG #2 makes one last play to take the truck. He tries to climb into the cab and JULIAN goes into a rage. He quickly fires three shots, missing THUG #2 with each one, but that forces LOUIS SERVIDIO to shoot two shots of his own at JULIAN to protect THUG #2. They miss as well, but one hits the main section of the tank and a small but steady stream of heating oil starts pouring out onto the roadway. \nJust then we hear sirens starting to come closer in the background. This adds a new element. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Where are you? \nTHUG #2 Over here. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO Where is he? \nTHUG #2 Over here. \nJULIAN is just trying to decide what to do next. The sirens are now getting much closer. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO Get the car! THUG #2 takes off. This now leaves JULIAN and LOUIS SERVIDIO all alone with the police coming. As JULIAN is hiding, trying to figure out what to do next, LOUIS SERVIDIO goes running by him. As he does: \nLOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Run for it! JULIAN thinks for a second and then runs. \nEXT. 59TH STREET BRIDGE - DAY \nJULIAN runs all along the bridge and then sees LOUIS SERVIDIO run through a small door into the body of one of the four massive stone anchor structures that hold up the bridge. \nINT. THE 59TH STREET BRIDGE, SUPPORT COLUMN - DAY \nOnce he is inside, there's another set of stairs. He locks the door behind him and starts racing down the stairs. As he heads down he hears someone just in front of him. He stops and looks down the center column of the stairs and looking up at him about three flights away is LOUIS SERVIDIO. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO Oh, there he is. Had to be the hero eh? \nJULIAN Fuck you. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO Couldn't just let us take the truck. \nJULIAN Fuck you! \nJULIAN is screaming in a fit of panic at this point. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO Hey man relax... calm down. Did they see you come in here? \nJULIAN can't stop breathing very heavy at this point. \nJULIAN I don't think so. \nThey both smile. His father is an old-school gangster. \nPETER FORENTE (CONT'D) A bunch of thugs invaded our home when I was a baby... My mother was there with us... My brother remembers it. Nothing happened. They were trying to scare my father. They ended up just leaving and we never found out who it was. But after that we moved to a fortress just like this. And those guys who let you in. They are here to shoot anyone who isn't invited. \nABEL I refuse to live my life that way. I won't do it... I am going to ask for a meeting. \nThey both look out and think it through a bit. \nPETER FORENTE Who? \nABEL Anyone with more than 20k of storage. Can I count on you being there? \nPETER looks away for a long beat. \nPETER FORENTE Yes... When are you closing on the terminal? \nABEL Monday. \nPETER FORENTE Congratulations. ABEL Hold that... it's not done yet... you may be hearing from me. (Trailed by an awkward laugh.) \nPETER FORENTE Well, good luck. \nABEL stands up ready to go. \nABEL Thank you for seeing me. I want more than this... \nPETER FORENTE I know you do. My father is in jail... as you know. And I have always wanted to conduct myself differently than he did. \nABEL And you have. \nPETER FORENTE Almost exclusively, yes. But I know why he did what he did. Because at the time it's easier. \nABEL But it's not. \nPETER FORENTE Yes it is. You are a good man. I will see what I can find out. This isn't good for any of us. \nABEL Thank you. \nEXT. PETER FORENTE'S DRIVEWAY - DAY ABEL is walking across the beautifully-manicured driveway, and as he gets nearer to his car he starts to hear the mayhem that is coming from the CB radio in the front seat. As he gets closer he gets more and more details. \nRADIO DISPATCHER V.O. Where is the truck now? RESPONDING DRIVER V.O. It's still on the bridge. \nRADIO DISPATCHER V.O. Is it still leaking oil? \nRESPONDING DRIVER V.O. No. They have stopped the leak. \nRADIO DISPATCHER V.O. Did it reach the river? \nRESPONDING DRIVER V.O. Some did. \nRADIO DISPATCHER V.O. How many shots were fired? \nABEL now slams open the door and gets into the driver side and picks up the microphone. \nABEL Joanne it's me. What are you talking about... what shots? \nThe camera now comes around to the outside of the car looking back at ABEL through the windshield. The mansion is looming in the background. We see ABEL'S face react as he hears the news of the incident on the bridge. The camera pulls back as ABEL'S face goes totally cold. \nINT. COURT ROOM - DAY \nABEL walks into an almost empty courtroom. LAWRENCE is packing up his things at the front of the room. They catch each others eye. ABEL makes his way forward as everyone else leaves. They look at each other for a beat. \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE I heard. \nABEL I need to make sure you know that we had nothing to do with this. It's not the way I do business. In fact I have been warning my men against doing this sort of thing. It is terrible for me. \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE It's not good... for either of us. ABEL Yes. \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE In my job we use whatever leverage we can gain, as I'm sure you do in your business. It's an ongoing investigation, and it will be just one piece of many. So while I appreciate you coming here... I have nothing I can tell you. \nLAWRENCE looks around the room thinking while ABEL says nothing, just waiting. A.D.A. LAWRENCE (CONT'D) What a fucking mess this place is... Do you know where he is? \nABEL No... but I'll find him. \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE You should. And when you do, bring him to us. A situation like this, happening in such a dangerous and public way, within an industry I'm charged with cleaning up. It's very bad for me... professionally speaking. \nThey look at each other one last time. ABEL gets the message. \nEXT. SMALL QUIET SIDE STREET, QUEENS - DAY \nSALES STUDENT ALEX is walking down the street looking terrible. His clothes are ruined by garbage, and he is scared. As he approaches his car his face drops. \nABEL No... I'm not... They're out. \nThis gets her attention. ANNA Who? \nABEL The bank. \nWith that ABEL walks out of the room and heads up the stairs to his bedroom. When he's halfway up the stairs she stops him. \nANNA So what does that mean? \nABEL It means we need to find the money somewhere else. \nANNA We have two days! \nABEL I'll figure it out. \nINT. ANNA'S CAR, WESTCHESTER SCENIC HIGHWAY - DAY \nABEL is driving ANNA'S car towards the city. ANNA is in the passenger seat and the three DAUGHTERS are in the back. ANNA and ABEL do not look any better. In fact there is now a tinge of anger mixed into the sadness. \nThe DAUGHTERS are arguing about who's taking up too much room in the back seat. \nDAUGHTERS Move. \nANNA Quiet. \nDAUGHTERS You move. \nANNA turns and snaps at them a bit. ANNA Stop. I've told you guys not to push it this morning, this is not the morning to be doing this... but since the second you all woke up. It's this, it's that. Just stop. The world does not revolve around you! This shuts them up for a beat. ABEL is seething. But then ELIZABETH (middle) nudges ANNIE (oldest) so she gives CATHERINE (youngest) a good hit. ANNA sees it and freaks. \nANNA (CONT'D) That's it Annie we've told you... \nBefore ANNA can get the full sentence out ABEL suddenly pulls the car off the side of the highway into the grass. Everyone in the car is taken aback. The road is a smaller scenic highway not some eight lane affair but this whole sequence still plays out with the menacing roar of the cars going by right next to them. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nABEL gets out of the car and slams the door. He walks around the back of the car as the cars fly by them on the highway. He goes around to his oldest daughter's door and pulls ANNIE from the car. They stand behind the car and go at it with the traffic flying by. ABEL is louder than he has been in the entire film. He is losing it from all the pressure but his daughter bears the brunt. \nABEL You are thirteen years old. What are you doing? Your mother asks you an hour ago to help her get out of the house smoothly and you are acting like an... \nANNIE Oh fuck you! \nABEL What? What? What are you talking about? \nABEL is looking around for someone to help him and witness this. He then switches, he has had enough and gets right up in her face. \nABEL (CONT'D) I'm not sure who the hell you think you are, but you don't talk to me that way... You are in serious danger of becoming a rich little spoiled brat and I can tell you from experience there is nothing worse in the world than a rich little girl who thinks the whole world revolves around her. ANNIE is yelling back over the traffic. \nANNIE The world revolves around me? Me! What about her? And what about you? You're both so totally obsessed with your stupid business. You walk around like you are saving the world but what are you doing... nothing! \nThis stings. He now changes his tone to a quiet low roar. But he can't keep quiet and by the end of the line he is yelling again. ABEL First off I don't walk around like I am saving anything. I chose this business because I looked at the world and said `What's the last bill people stop paying every month when they are low on cash?' `Cause that's a business I want to be in. `Cause failure wasn't much of an option for me. I lived in reality... not whatever this world is you are living in. And we help people stay warm... which isn't all that bad. (now he is yelling again) Maybe you've got grander ambitions but for now this is how you eat, sleep, and get all dressed up... So you better shape the fuck up and NEVER speak to me like this again! \nANNA Stop!! \nThey both look over and ANNA is standing there. A calmness suddenly falls down on all of them. \nINT. ANNA'S CAR ON HIGHWAY - DAY All five of them are sitting in the car, sadness prevails. \nINT. ANNA MORALES' LIBRARY - NIGHT \nThe camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. We hear the sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. As we come through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk in a pool of light from the desk lamp. She is deep in it crunching numbers. Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he looks exhausted. \nABEL Hey. \nShe looks up with a small but sweet smile. \nANNA Hi. \nABEL How's it coming? \nANNA I've made it to 1975. \nABEL That was a good year. \nANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally support that claim. \nABEL (CONT'D) Well it was for me...how is it? \nANNA I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... Turns out I kinda knew what I was doing. \nThey give each other a slight smile. \nANDREW WALSH Good. Your background check with us says you have never been arrested, is that true? \nJULIAN Why is this putting everything at risk? \nANDREW WALSH Have you ever been arrested? \nJULIAN No. \nANDREW WALSH Because no bank will touch us right now. So we can't close on the new property. And he's going to lose everything on his deposit. \nThis sits heavily on JULIAN. ANDREW hands him a card. \nANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) This is a lawyer who will meet you when they bring you to the station. You no longer work for us. You've been fired. But Abel wants to pay for the lawyer. So... this guy should be able to help you. Good luck. \nWith that JULIAN gets out of the car. ABEL is standing there. They meet. \nJULIAN I'm sorry. \nABEL I know. JULIAN I was scared. \nABEL I know. \nJULIAN Aren't you scared? \nABEL Sometimes. \nJULIAN What do you do? \nABEL thinks this through long and hard. \nABEL I have always been much more scared of failure than anything else. \nJULIAN I... \nABEL It wasn't always like this. \nJULIAN Are you ruined? ABEL Not today... but by the end of the week... maybe. \nJULIAN I'm sorry. ABEL Good... \nJULIAN No... I am not strong. \nABEL That does not have to be true. \nJULIAN Trust me... I am not... I'm sorry. \nWith that JULIAN walks across the parking lot towards the POLICE to turn himself in. ANDREW walks up behind ABEL and stands there looking. ANDREW WALSH I'm late. I will meet you at four. \nABEL I'm gonna try to get us a little more time. \nThe three COPS are standing waiting as JULIAN walks towards them. ABEL turns around, facing the camera, and closes his eyes in sadness. \nWith ABEL in the foreground we see JULIAN make it halfway to the COPS, then he stops. \nCOP 1 Hey. \nABEL'S face tells us he knows what is coming. \nJULIAN sets off running. Before the COPS can get close to him he is off. ABEL turns and sees what is happening. He does not follow chase. His head just drops. \nEXT. VARIOUS 1980'S URBAN DECAY LANDSCAPES We are now with JULIAN again, running. But as this chase continues we see his face turn from fear, to desperation, to a creeping sense of evil. He does not know how it has come to this, but as he jumps down from fences and runs across deserted lots we see that his weakness is turning. \nAs he runs through some of the most bombed-out, destroyed sections of Queens, he just never stops. With each step his fear turns to... anger. \nEXT. BLOWN-OUT BUILDING \nHe stops, collapses, and hides behind a blown-out building wall just as a COP CAR drives by. He starts to almost cry, but then it again becomes something else. His survival instinct is taking over and we are not sure what will become of it. Anger. \nINT. OLDEST HASIDIC BUSINESSMAN'S LIVING ROOM - DAY \nABEL sits across from the oldest Hasidic member of the family, JOSEPH, from the first scene. ABEL Thank you for seeing me. \nJOSEPH Of course. \nABEL I need more time. \nJOSEPH Of course you do. \nABEL I know our agreement doesn't allow for that. But... I need more time. \nJOSEPH Why? \nANDREW WALSH I'm sorry? \nABEL This plea has me... \nANDREW WALSH I know. It's just a first offer. ABEL I would never take this. \nANDREW WALSH I know. \nABEL looks off and resets. \nANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) He's going to get us the meeting. \nABEL Who? \nANDREW WALSH Lawrence, he's tight with O'Leary. \nABEL Of course he is. \nANDREW WALSH Does Julian have anything? \nABEL gives him a look? \nANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) Anything on us? \nABEL All the drivers could have us on scales. Why? \nANDREW WALSH If we are cutting deals, we can't have anything new come up at the last minute. \nABEL He would never do that. \nANDREW WALSH We need to find him... Lawrence needs him. \nINT. JULIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY \nABEL stands outside the door for a very long beat then finally knocks. \nJULIAN'S wife, LUISA, opens the door. She gestures him in. \nHe enters the apartment and looks around. She gestures for him to sit. He chooses a seat right across from her. He stares at her for a beat. Then for the first time we hear him speak Spanish. (This whole conversation is in Spanish) \nABEL Thank you for letting me in. \nLUISA Of course. \nABEL moves his chair closer. It's meant to be, and is a bit threatening. \nABEL Have you seen Julian? \nLUISA No. \nABEL questions her with a look. \nABEL We need to find him. \nLUISA I know. \nABEL I am worried about him. \nLUISA So am I. ABEL You know we were going to support him. I do not know why he ran. \nLUISA He was scared. ABEL shakes his head. \nABEL I know. \nLUISA He has always wanted to make you proud. You know that right? \nABEL Yes. Well this time that hasn't worked out. \nLUISA No... How did you do it? ABEL Do what? \nLUISA This. \nShe motions towards his suit. \nLUISA (CONT'D) Success... that's all he wanted. \nABEL I know. It makes me very sad, because he is a very talented young man. But there are some decisions that you cannot come back from. I need to know where he is. And I need him to turn himself in. His actions are hurting me and my business. And I refuse to let other people's weaknesses hurt me. I don't know how it has come to this, but it has. If he does the right thing I will help to take care of his responsibilities. You and your family. When you see him. Tell him this. Please. \nLUISA I will. ABEL gets up and starts looking around the apartment a bit. He walks over to a small cabinet. \nABEL Does he have any money? \nABEL I need $500,000. SAUL and his GRANDDAUGHTER look at each other. They say nothing but clearly know each other well. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ Would you give us a minute. \nABEL Of course. \nINT. WAITING AREA, OUTSIDE THE CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nABEL sits in a simple chair outside the conference room looking around at an office that is similar to his. A phone on the receptionist's desk rings. She picks it up. \nLEFKOWITZ RECEPTIONIST You can go back in. \nINT. SLIGHTLY RUNDOWN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nABEL sits down. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ We can offer you the 500k at 20 percent for a year. (MORE) \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ (CONT'D) And we would need a five-year straight wholesale holding agreement for 250,000 gallons a year at your new facility. \nThis hits ABEL hard. \nABEL Okay. Thank you. They shake hands and then he hugs the old man good bye. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ So, I guess we will see you tonight? \nABEL Tonight? Oh yes, of course. \nINT. LONG ISLAND ITALIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA HOSTESS leads ABEL and ANDREW through the whole main dining room and through a side kitchen. \nINT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - PRIVATE DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nFinally they come through a door and into a small back private dining room where fifteen of their COMPETITORS, a couple of whom we have already met (Including LORRAINE and SAUL LEFKOWITZ, and ARNOLD KLINE), are sitting around the table meeting and waiting for them to arrive. The whole room looks up at them. \nO'LEARY is at the head of the table at the far end of the room. He stands up to greet them and then so does the rest of the room. \nBILL O'LEARY Abel. Please sit. \nFinally everyone settles and the room falls quiet. \nBILL O'LEARY (CONT'D) Abel. \nNow the room is silent as it waits and waits for him to speak. \nABEL Stop... \nABEL is deadly serious. He just lets this sit and looks around the room at each person. They all seem to be waiting for him to continue. But he doesn't. He just lets this sit. Finally PETER FORENTE, who is across from ABEL, shifts in his seat and leans forward. \nPETER FORENTE Um... Abel... we had a chance to meet for a little bit before you got here and... of course everyone in this room is fully capable of lying to their own mothers on their deathbeds, but... the conclusion we have come to... I should say we are fairly convinced after a very frank conversation... that these guys who are doing this... that they don't actually work for anyone in this room. As you know there are many other smaller providers in the area that might be responsible who are not here tonight. \nThis sits in the room for a long beat. Everyone then shifts back their attention to ABEL waiting for his response. Finally. ABEL Peter... thank you... That may be true. \nHe stops and thinks about how to continue. \nABEL (CONT'D) But over the last six months 110,000 gallons of fuel has been stolen from my family and I. Now the reason we asked Bill to get you all here is because the people in this room are the only people within two hundred miles of here who have the ability to purchase and store that kind of quantity. So... no matter what bullshit you have been telling each other one of you... or two... or three... has been allowing this to happen by buying this from these cowards or worse yet hiring these guys just to do it. And profiting from it. So what I am saying is... Stop! Now. Have some pride in what you do and stop. \nINT. ANNA MORALES' LIBRARY - NIGHT The camera moves slowly across a dark hallway. We hear the sounds of a manual adding machine grinding away. As we come through the doorway we see ANNA MORALES sitting at her desk in a pool of light from the desk lamp. She is deep in it crunching numbers. Finally ABEL walks into the doorway, he looks exhausted. \nABEL Hey. \nShe looks up with a small but sweet smile. \nANNA Hi. \nABEL How's it coming? \nANNA I've made it to 1975. \nABEL That was a good year. ANNA gives a slight look that the numbers may not totally support that claim. \nABEL (CONT'D) Well it was for me...how is it? \nANNA I'm not sure yet... but it's not as bad as they are saying it is... I guess I knew what I was doing. \nThey give each other a slight smile. \nANNA (CONT'D) How'd you do? \nABEL I got us a three more days... and one piece... from Saul. But we're still about a million short. \nThey stare at each other. \nABEL Your friend is dead... who do you work for. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO You know I could never tell you that. \nABEL Stop... just stop. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO This was it anyway. Okay... Okay. ABEL looks right through him and then finally lowers the gun and releases his hands from around his jacket and he gets up and looks back at ABEL. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO (CONT'D) Thank you. \nLOUIS SERVIDIO then runs out of the car as the door opens. ABEL sits up and slows his breathing down. Finally he looks around the trashed car and sees that a woman has been in the car with them the whole time and she is just staring at him. \nINT. BROOKLYN BARBERSHOP - DAY \nABEL walks into the shop and is a little put back together but is worse for the wear. ARNOLD KLINE is sitting in one of the chairs waiting. He turns to ABEL. \nARNOLD KLINE Hey. \nABEL Jimmy, can you give me a minute? \nJimmy looks around then walks into the back. \nARNOLD KLINE Abel, that was well said. \nABEL Thank you. \nARNOLD KLINE What can I do for you? \nABEL I've just come to collect that check you owe me. \nThis takes him back a step. \nARNOLD KLINE What check is that? \nABEL The one for $213,000. ARNOLD KLINE I'm sorry? \nABEL That's how much has been taken from me over the last six months. ARNOLD KLINE I had nothing to do with that. \nABEL Your Far Rockaway facility bought a load of fuel last week off one of my stolen trucks. \nARNOLD KLINE That's not possible. \nABEL I was standing on top of one of my hi-jacked trucks a couple weeks ago thinking about the cowards who did this when I remembered I had bought the load of fuel off a friend's tanker straight from Texas. As I'm sure you know Texas #4 is marked. But that was just one load, so every truck that has left my lot for the last two weeks has been marked with dye that I've put in... And luckily four more of my trucks got jacked since.... My guess is there are at least 4600 gallons of marked fuel in your small tank right now. \nNo answer. Finally. \nARNOLD KLINE How much? \nABEL I said...213,000. \nARNOLD KLINE I'll need a day. \nABEL Okay. \nABEL gets ready to leave. \nARNOLD KLINE I've just been buying this stuff off these guys, it was only a couple loads, I don't know who they are. I would never do that. \nABEL My goal was to have you out of business by the end of next year. And if you're this fucking desperate it doesn't seem like it will even take that long. \nHe walks away. \nARNOLD KLINE Abel, I wasn't the only person buying this shit. \nHe turns. \nABEL I don't care. \nARNOLD KLINE It may ruin me. ABEL When you find out who else it was you can get them to pay you back the difference. Kinda makes you miss having your father around? But I need the whole lot tomorrow or the feds will be at your doorstep by noon. \nHe leaves. \nEXT. UNIVERSITY ATHLETIC FIELD - DAY \nABEL is sitting on a bleacher totally alone watching a prep school football practice. We stay with him as he sits quietly just watching. \nEventually his 21-YEAR-OLD YOUNGER BROTHER, ELIAS, comes walking off the field over to him. PLAYERS start leaving the field. \nABEL You look good out there. \nPETER FORENTE That was very well said last night. \nABEL Thank you. And thanks for seeing me. \nPETER FORENTE Of course. So what is it? \nABEL I need a loan. \nPETER'S face scrunches up like he tasted a lemon and he turns away for a beat. Then comes back. PETER FORENTE You don't want to do that. \nABEL No shit... but I'm here. \nPETER FORENTE What are we talking about here. \nABEL Six hundred thousand. \nPETER FORENTE Jesus. Abel, that's a problem. \nABEL Yes... but if I don't get it... \nPETER FORENTE What's my collateral? \nABEL The terminal. PETER FORENTE Yeah me and how many other people will be coming after it. No way. \nABEL You'll get your money. \nPETER FORENTE Abel, you know I respect everything you've done. Because of it we haven't come down on you the way I should have for coming into my service area and poaching my customers. You're good at what you do, probably better than us, and I accept that. But this would be different. I don't want you to be in this position. We are not nice people to borrow three quarters of million dollars from. \nABEL I know that. \nPETER FORENTE Let's sleep on this. Both of us. \nINT. ABEL AND ANNA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT ABEL comes in as ANNA is sitting at the table smoking. He walks over and sits down at the table with her. \nShe gives him a great sly smile. \nANNA What a day. ABEL Yeah. \nANNA Are you okay? \nABEL Yes. \nANNA Car chases? \nABEL Yeah. \nANNA Who knew? \nShe gives him a loving look. \nANNA (CONT'D) How was your brother? \nABEL He seemed good... But the girls up at that place are... \nANNA Stop. \nABEL I can tell you the girls didn't look like that where I went to school... \nANNA Enough. \nAfter a brief light moment the cloud comes back over him. \nABEL How are we here? \nANNA It was a lot of things all at once. ABEL Yeah. \nANNA How did it go? \nABEL We can probably pull it off. Three different parties... it'll be a mess... and the terms... Peter suddenly showed me his true colors. \nHe lets out a brutal sigh. \nANNA I'm sorry. \nABEL I spent my whole life trying not to become a gangster... \nANNA I know. ABEL ...And now... on the biggest deal in my career they will all control me. \nHe sits there for a long beat and then she comes and hands him a piece of paper with a series of numbers on it. He looks up at her. \nABEL (CONT'D) What is this? \nWith that they both smile, she signs it and then gives him a kiss. \nINT. TEMPORARY TRAILER - DAY ABEL comes back in and hands the docs to JOSEPH, the oldest Hasid, who signs them. \nJOSEPH Mazel Tov. \nEXT. TRAILER/TANK FARM - DAY \nABEL walks across the lot with joy although it seems masked by a sadness. He looks around as ANDREW and ANNA come up next to him. \nANDREW WALSH Congratulations. ABEL To you too. Did you know...about the money? \nANNA Abel. \nANDREW looks him right in the eye. \nANDREW WALSH Yes. \nABEL You should have told me. \nANDREW WALSH I know. I'm sorry. \nANNA Abel...congratulations. Now cheer up. And can someone give me a tour of this place we just paid two million bucks for? \nABEL, ANDREW, and ANNA walk towards the tanks looking around. They come around the corner to THE VIEW. \nEXT. BEHIND THE TANKS, WITH A VIEW OF THE CITY - DAY They all look out. \nANNA What a hell-hole this city is. \nABEL No. ANDREW WALSH I don't know why but I guess I never realized we even had this view from back here. \nThat line sits for a long beat. \nABEL I did. \nThen they hear someone behind them. They turn. It's JULIAN. He is standing holding a gun. They stare for a long beat. \nABEL (CONT'D) I thought you said you threw that into the river? JULIAN I didn't. \nABEL I see that. \nJULIAN I have nowhere to go. \nABEL Nowhere easy. \nJULIAN Fuck you. I have nothing. And somehow you've ended up with everything you wanted. \nABEL looks at the gun in his hand. \nABEL It wasn't meant to be. \nJULIAN What is that supposed to mean? \nABEL I know what you wanted. But you need to forget that. You are looking backward. Only look forward, that is what you can control. \nJULIAN I'm sorry. You gave me a very good chance. Right? ABEL Yes. \nJULIAN Probably a better chance than I deserved. \nABEL No. \nJULIAN Please take care of my family. \nABEL Julian. JULIAN Please... \nABEL looks at him trying to read where this poor kid is at. \nABEL I will. \nWith that JULIAN takes the gun and puts it in his mouth and pulls the trigger. \nThe gun goes off and the red blood sprays on the white side of the fuel tank that is behind him. \nABEL and the rest are left totally in shock. They are beside themselves. But out of the corner of his eye ABEL notices that the bullet has also pierced through the tank and amid the red spray a flow of black heating oil is pouring out through the bullet hole onto the ground. \nABEL steps around JULIAN'S body and goes over to the hole. He picks up an old rag from the ground and stuffs it into the hole plugging the flow of oil. \nANDREW WALSH What... what should we do? \nABEL turns and looks back at him. ABEL We call the police. \n", "test1_input": "A.D.A. LAWRENCE I'm just looking here through these reports. It looks like out of the nineteen registered heating oil companies in the city your trucks have been getting hit three to one. ABEL Yes? \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE So are you maybe doing something to bring this on yourself? \nANDREW WALSH Like what? \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE Like enter a new market? \nABEL I am always trying to expand my business. \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE Of course. But I think you understand what I'm saying... there are always some markets that are more difficult than others to enter. \nABEL Every new market is a difficult market. (MORE) \nABEL (CONT'D) But my driver was assaulted and my truck and oil were stolen in broad daylight in front of fifteen toll collectors and six police officers yesterday. And yet no one saw anything. That is a problem... no? \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE I have a lot of problems coming across my desk every day Mr. Morales. \nABEL I'm sure you do. \nINT. HALLWAY OF BROOKLYN D.A. COURT BUILDING - DAY \nABEL walks out in front of ANDREW. \nANDREW WALSH Abel. Abel. \nHe stops and turns. \nANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) (his words escape him) \nABEL Exactly. \nANDREW WALSH No... let's not overreact. We don't even know what they are bringing against us. It could be total bullshit, and they are just trying to use us along the way. This isn't anything yet. \nABEL I know. \nINT. ANNA'S OFFICE STANDARD HEATING OIL - DAY \nANNA is working away on an adding machine in her office. She is listening to the radio that sits behind her on the desk. We can see that she is in her comfort zone. ABEL enters. \nANNA How'd it go? \nABEL The DA... He said he's going to bring down charges on us next week. \nANNA For what? \nABEL We don't know yet. ANNA Who else? \nABEL Right now they are just saying us. \nBeat. \nABEL (CONT'D) Where are we exposed? \nANNA We follow standard industry practice on every front. \nABEL Anna? \nANNA I need to know what they are saying we did. \nBeat. \nABEL Okay. \nINT. HOSPITAL LONG HALLWAY - DAY \nABEL walks down the long hallway and enters a room. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nJULIAN is sitting on the edge of the bed, waiting. His jaw is in bandages, and there are crutches sitting next to him, but he looks much better than the previous day. They look at each other intensely but say nothing. \nINT. SHIT-HOLE TENEMENT STAIRWELL - DAY ABEL is helping JULIAN up the stairs. They struggle together. Finally they get to the top floor and stand outside apartment number . JULIAN stops, not really wanting to open the door in front of his boss. \nABEL I'm very sorry this happened. Do you need anything else? (JULIAN nods no) If you do, you call the office... Okay then. \nHe turns to leave and walks back to the stairs. \nJULIAN Abel? \nABEL turns and looks at him. \n", "test1_true": "ABEL thinks this through. ABEL I don't. \nJULIAN I... I'm not sure I will be able... \nABEL You will. \nJULIAN changes the subject. \nJULIAN Did you get the truck back? \nABEL Yes. They took the load. \nJULIAN This is the sixth one? \nABEL Seventh... you get some rest. \nEXT. BUILDING BY ABEL'S CAR - DAY ABEL comes out of the building and walks towards his car where a group of TOUGH-LOOKING KIDS in their early twenties are sitting, looking to see who is going to come and claim the brand new car. He walks right though them without being overly aggressive but without a hint of being intimidated. He gets in and drives away. \nINT. BROOKLYN BARBERSHOP - NIGHT \nABEL is sitting in the barber chair getting a trim. Through the window we see ARNOLD KLINE, a competitor of ABEL'S walking by. They see each other. ARNOLD KLINE comes into the shop followed by a BODYGUARD. He sits down next to ABEL. This conversation happens with them both looking at each other in the mirror. \nARNOLD KLINE Well, look who it is. \nABEL Arnold. \nARNOLD KLINE Just a touch off the side Jimmy. Not all of us are as lucky as Mr. Morales here in terms of keeping our hair. \nBARBER JIMMY You're a good looking man. \nARNOLD KLINE I know I am. So I hear congratulations are in order? \nABEL What's that? \nARNOLD KLINE You got yourself in contract over there. \nABEL We are working on it. \nARNOLD KLINE Thirty day close I hear, you better be. \nABEL We are, thanks for your concern. \nBARBER JIMMY finishes ABEL, and he stands up to leave. ABEL has his back to KLINE as he pays. ARNOLD KLINE I saw a couple of your trucks over in Rego Park the other day. \nThis brings ABEL around to look at him square. \nABEL Really? When was that? \nARNOLD KLINE A couple times. \nABEL It's possible. \nARNOLD KLINE Is it? \nABEL Yes. \nARNOLD KLINE That's a tough market. ABEL It is. \nARNOLD KLINE My father struggled for years before he broke in there. \nABEL Any new market is a tough one. I'll see you. \nABEL walks out of the shop and looks around. It is now dark outside. \nEXT. COUNTRY ROAD - NEXT MORNING \nABEL is jogging again but this time he is deep in the woods. He runs along the road. We then hear a car coming from behind him. The car noise then turns into more of a truck noise. He stops and turns around as we see a large truck coming towards him. \nHe gets himself over to the side of the road. We have a slight fear it might hit him. But as it passes we see it's a large moving truck. There's a second one following right behind it. \nAs the trucks pass it registers on ABEL's face. He cuts into a path in the woods. \nEXT. DRIVEWAY \nABEL walks up to his house, and we see the moving trucks preparing to unload. ANNA gets out of her car with the kids, and they run around and check out the house as ANNA directs the movers. ABEL comes up and stands next to her. They smile a protected smile at their new home. ABEL gives her a kiss. \nINT. DINING ROOM OF NEW HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe whole family sits around the table in candlelight. They are eating takeout, but with a mismatch of formal and everyday tableware that has been unpacked. There are boxes all around them. \nANNA I know it has been a long road, and that not all of you wanted to do this, but thank you. For me... ABEL A toast. \n", "test2_input": "ANNA What's he doing? \nABEL is now standing up to go look. ABEL Quiet... don't worry. It's nothing. \nANNA tries to go back to sleep. \nINT. HALLWAYS/KID'S ROOMS - NIGHT ABEL walks out of the bedroom and slowly heads down the hall to his kids' rooms. He looks in each room and the CHILD is sleeping soundly with nothing out of place. \nINT. KIDS' ROOMS/HALLWAY- SAME TIME \nAs he comes out of the last bedroom back into the hallway he sees his dog standing at the top of the stairs looking down over the balcony into the living room. The dog is starting to quietly growl once again. \nABEL'S face goes from total comfort that his kids are safe to total paranoia. He slowly walks down the hall. He stops off in his bedroom closet and grabs a mid-size baseball bat/billy club. Now he is heading down the stairs with the club trying not to freak himself out. \nINT. OPEN LIVING ROOM/ENTRY HALL/FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nABEL walks down the stairs and the dog just stands at the top, still growling every now and then. ABEL comes into the living room and everything seems perfectly normal. He then relaxes and turns towards the dog. \nABEL Quiet. It's nothing. Come down here. \nHe snaps his fingers and calls the dog. The dog finally comes down the stairs. \nABEL now heads towards the kitchen in a relaxed state, but then the dog starts growling again and looking out the windows next to the front door. ABEL comes over, he opens the front door but the dog refuses to go out. \nABEL (CONT'D) Go. Oh come on. Go. \nABEL thinks he hears something. He clicks on the lights and pulls his bat back up into position. He heads outside. \nEXT. FRONT DOOR TO ABEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT ABEL comes to the end of the front walk and there is nothing. The dog has now followed him outside and is slowly heading over to a area where a small exterior hallway leads to a side entrance. It is dark. The dog starts barking and going crazy. ABEL slowly heads over to the covered passageway. \nAll hell now breaks lose. A BURGLAR, in all black, comes blasting out of the shadows. The dog tries to bite him as he goes by. ABEL swings his club and hits BURGLAR square on the shoulder but he keeps coming. He knocks ABEL over and runs towards the driveway. ABEL is up and chasing after him faster than we expect. \nEXT. BASE OF THE RAVINE DEEP IN WOODS- CONTINUOUS \nThere is a pretty good moon out so we can see them running full throttle through the very thick woods. ABEL is keeping up with him and in fact may be gaining on him. \nABEL is still in his pajamas. He has a rage that has been building up inside him for a good two weeks that is now pouring out of him in the energy to chase this guy down. They come to the top of a small ravine which ABEL seems to know from his runs through the woods and ABEL takes a bit of an easier/quicker path down. \nEXT. WOODS BEHIND ABEL'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nABEL now cuts him off at an angle and swings the bat at his legs. BURGLAR trips and goes flying. ABEL falls as he swings at him. They both sit on the ground for a beat. ABEL is exhausted. They stare at each other. \nA brief look of panic comes across BURGLAR's face. Then he is up again and running off into the woods. \nABEL gets himself up and chases after him. \nEXT. ROAD NEXT TO THE WOODS - NIGHT \nABEL comes out of the woods into the middle of the road, and in the distance we see BURGLAR run up to a waiting van with its lights and engine on. The guy gets into the passenger side of the van, and it peels out. \nABEL is left standing in the middle of the road, barely able to breathe and holding the bat. \nEXT. ABEL FRONT DOOR - NIGHT ABEL comes walking back towards his front door. ANNA is standing with all the lights on and with the dog sitting next to her. She looks at him in shock. \nANNA Where were you? \nABEL (looking to the dog) A lot of help you were. \nANNA Abel? \nThey both look down at his bare feet. He has been in some kind of shock and hasn't even noticed that his bare feet are cut up to pieces from running in the woods through the ice. His feet are bleeding all over the walkway. \nINT. POWDER ROOM OF ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nANNA is in warrior mode. Any panic in her voice has disappeared, and she is speaking with a calm yet deadly seriousness. She is cleaning the cuts on his feet and putting bandages on them as they talk. \nANNA Who was it? \nABEL What do you mean, how am I supposed to know who it was? \nShe gives him a look. \nABEL (CONT'D) I don't know. \nShe gives him another look. \nABEL (CONT'D) I think it was just some punk, looking to rip us off. \nANNA If you... \nABEL Ouch! If they had wanted to send a message he could have... and he didn't. \n", "test2_true": "ABEL Please. Don't get going on this. We are a big new house. He probably wanted the TV. He didn't have a gun, he had nothing. The alarm will be in on Monday. It was some kid. They aren't coming back. \nShe looks at him with considerable concern. \nHe leans in and starts kissing her. She holds still at first then gives in. \nINT. TRAINING ROOM AT STANDARD HEATING OIL - NEXT MORNING \nABEL is in a suit but is kneeling and almost lying on his back showing three SALES RECRUITS what they should be looking for. Another INSTRUCTOR looks on. We see ABEL in his element. He is a salesman. \nABEL What you are looking for here is the opening to the burn chamber. Now at this point you have not tipped your hat in anyway. From the minute you walked in the house you should have been working to create an impression of total impartiality. But now... \nHe reaches over and opens the small door. A fire is burning inside. On cue the instructor hands ABEL a crisp clean white handkerchief. \nABEL (CONT'D) When this door opens you begin to close. It must always be spotless. If they see you have ever done this before it is over. \nHe takes it and reaches up into a small exhaust chimney. \nABEL (CONT'D) Now, you do this and only this... You look down at the cloth and don't say a word... You just keep staring at the cloth and then you slowly just start shaking your head. Very very slowly and small. (MORE) \nABEL (CONT'D) Don't look up at them. Just at the cloth. Then ABEL makes a small clicking noise. \nINSTRUCTOR Do you hear that noise... that's the noise. \nSALES STUDENT ALEX What noise? \nABEL It means you are close... Then after sitting in silence way longer than is comfortable, you turn. And say \"I'd love to run a few numbers for you. Is there somewhere more comfortable we could sit.\" They will almost always take you to the dining room table and will offer you something. And whatever it is you always take the fancy option. \nINSTRUCTOR Can I get you a coffee or tea? ABEL A tea please. \nINSTRUCTOR We have some homemade lemonade or a soda. \nABEL I'd love a lemonade, thank you. \nSALES STUDENT ALEX Why? \nABEL Because, we are never going to be the cheapest option, so we have to be the best. And they want... no, need... to feel that you want the best too. That's why our trucks are the newest or cleanest, and our drivers are approachable. \nJust then the woman who works behind the front desk (STANDARD FRONT DESK) comes to the door. \nSTANDARD FRONT DESK They need you. \nABEL I gotta go, but the final point I will make is the hardest one. Once you have done the math and shown them what we can save them over the long haul through proper maintenance, you need them to sign. And the problem is by hiring you that means they are firing someone else. And that's never easy. So to get them over the line you need to close them. So when you show them the number look up at them both... and just stare at them... \nABEL begins staring at the recruits. He continues to stare. \nABEL (CONT'D) You stare longer than you should. Because this is not a joke. You will only keep this job if you close. And that's not funny to you. And I am only interested in this company growing, and when it isn't I don't think it's funny at all. These people work very hard for their money and these other guys are ripping them off, treating them poorly, because they don't know... so when you look them in the eye you have to believe that we are better, and we are, but you will never do anything as hard as staring a person straight in the eye and telling the truth. \nABEL then does exactly that to them. And he holds it for a long beat. \nABEL (CONT'D) Well... it was great to meet you. Welcome and I wish you luck. \nABEL walks out of the room and straight into. \nINT. LARGE STAFF MEETING ROOM - DAY \nThere is a great high/low nature to the way ABEL runs the company. While he wears great suits and his trucks are impeccable, he does not waste money. So this room where the drivers have company meetings is very basic. \nThe room is filled with all of the drivers. There is a bit of a nervous energy in the room. It quiets as ABEL comes in. He stands aside. \nSTANDARD FRONT DESK Trucks 16 through 23 you should be ready to go... \nAs STANDARD FRONT DESK sees ABEL standing behind her, she stops. ABEL walks forward a few steps. ABEL Good morning. First off, I picked up Julian yesterday and he is back home and doing much better. And I just wanted to make sure you are all aware that we are doing everything we can to deal with this situation. We are working with law enforcement, and they seem to be closing in on these guys. But, sadly these are the times we are living in and we must rise above them. So, on that front we have these. He puts one of the new radios on the dais. ANDREW comes into the room behind ABEL and stands. \nABEL (CONT'D) These will be in every truck by the end of the week. Much to my wife's concern I spent some serious coin and we now have our own closed channel that shouldn't have any blackout areas. You will always be in contact with us. (a hand goes up in the BACK) Yes, Eddy. \nSENIOR DRIVER EDDY I have heard that the union is considering recommending other more active options for us to consider. Do you know about this? \nABEL looks to ANDREW. \nABEL We have been in constant contact with the union and they aren't considering any new course of action at this time. \nSENIOR DRIVER EDDY So this radio is what we got? ABEL Yes. \nEXT. ABEL AND ANNA'S HOUSE - DAY \nANNA is walking back from the mailbox looking through the day's mail. As she approaches the house she looks up and sees the two younger daughters, ELIZABETH (6 years old) and CATHERINE (4 years old), playing in front of the house. CATHERINE comes out from under a bush near the side door with something in her hand. \nANNA looks back down at the mail. As she gets closer to the house we see a look of concern come across her face. The look then turns to one of complete horror but as she gets closer to CATHERINE she tries to control her emotions. \nANNA Catherine... Catherine. Katie! \n", "test3_input": "ABEL Jesus. \nANNA I mean it. We can't just leave it here. \nEXT. BACKWOODS ROAD - NIGHT \nABEL gets out of the car and looks at his smashed hood. He then walks back and approaches the animal. It is laying on the side of the road. \nHe comes right up to it and stares into its eyes. It stares back at him. ABEL walks back to the car. \nANNA Is it dead? \nABEL No. \nANNA Well you need... \nABEL I know. \nHe reaches down to open the trunk. \nANNA What are you doing? \nABEL Getting the tire iron! This whole situation has stressed them out and they are on edge. \nABEL goes to the trunk and gets out the large wrench. He walks back over to the deer. He bends down next to it and stares into its eye again. ABEL is thinking back on something, or many things. He makes a small starting movement like he is going to hit it over the head but he stops himself. He can't quite do it. Then he sits with the animal a beat longer. \nWe come in very close to ABEL and see his hand is struggling to deliver the blow. Just as he grips the tire iron waiting... BANG! BANG! \nTwo very loud GUNSHOTS go off from right over his shoulder. He ducks for cover then slowly turns behind him. ANNA stands there holding a small-yet-powerful Saturday Night Special- style handgun. Smoke is still rising from the end of the pistol. The deer is dead. \nHe looks at her dumbfounded... where did she get this gun? She gives him a look. Then turns and walks back to the car. He stays and struggles to get the deer out of the road. \nINT. ABEL'S DAMAGED CAR - NIGHT \nANNA is sitting in the car waiting. We hear ABEL'S footsteps as he approaches the open driver's side door. He gets in without saying a word. We stay with them as they drive on in silence. \nINT. MORALES HOUSE, FRONT HALLWAY - NIGHT \nThe door opens and ABEL walks in. ANNA is already in the house talking with NANNY MARIA who's been baby-sitting. \nANNA Hello Maria, sorry we are a bit late. They were fine? \nNANNY MARIA Oh yes. All is good. \nANNA Great, thank you. We'll see you in the morning then. \nNANNY MARIA Okay. NANNY MARIA comes around the corner and passes ABEL who is just standing in the living room. He only gives her a nod. ANNA is standing on the other side of the room just waiting in silence as well. NANNY MARIA goes over to the closet and gets her coat out and puts it on. The tension is building like a kettle. Finally NANNY MARIA gets herself together and walks out and as the door shuts they come immediately at each other. \nANNA What? \nABEL What? \nANNA Yes... what? \nABEL Are you kidding? \nANNA No. ABEL Okay then... what is this gun? \nANNA I told you I wasn't going to just continue to stand around and let these people come and get me and my children. So unlike you who seems to be totally comfortable just standing around like some... fucking pussy... I did something about it. \nABEL is slightly stammering at this point, not quite sure what to do. They are still standing on opposite sides of the room from each other. He just waits... finally. \nABEL Where did you get it? \nANNA You know where I got it. \nABEL Do you have a permit? \nANNA Not yet. This sets him off. He comes walking across the room at her as if he might hit her. He gets closer and closer. \nABEL You must be a bigger fucking idiot than I even thought. You are trying to protect your children? Protect them? Do you have any idea what happens if you get caught using that thing? \nHe is now standing right over her. \nABEL (CONT'D) You dress yourself up in these fancy clothes, and look at you here in your mansion. I've given you everything you could possibly want but you still can't stop thinking like the Brooklyn corner-store gangster's daughter that you are. \nANNA You've given me? You? Are you delusional? Do you even understand how ridiculous that makes you sound? \nThey are really going at it now. He tries to grab her purse, which she still has over her shoulder. They struggle for it. \nABEL Where is this thing? Let me see it. \n", "test3_true": "ABEL Let me see it. Is this going to make you safe? \nWith that he uses brute force, probably hurting her arm, but she doesn't let on. He takes the purse from her. He opens it and takes out the small gun. \nABEL (CONT'D) You know who uses guns like this? (HE SCREAMS) Whores! \nWith that, she SLAPS him across the face. They just stare at each other for a very long time. ABEL (CONT'D) It's a trap... and you are walking right into it... You need to get that thing out of our house. \nANNA You need to protect us. ABEL That is what I'm doing. \nHe walks out the front door. \nINT. MAIN LIVING/DINING ROOM OF MORALES HOUSE - NEXT DAY \nThere are twelve SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS sitting around the dining room table yelling \"Happy Birthday\" to one of the Morales daughters as she blows out the candles. A large GROUP of the PARENTS surround the table. \nGROUP Happy Birthday! Just as ELIZABETH blows out the candles the doorbell rings. NANNY MARIA heads to the front door. The camera stays with the party. NANNY MARIA comes back into the room and standing behind her, we see a POLICE OFFICER holding some kind of clipboard. \nABEL walks over quickly trying not to create a scene. He leads the POLICE OFFICER back over to the front door. The PARENTS certainly notice and start stirring. \nEXT. FRONT STEPS - DAY \nABEL leads the OFFICER outside, and as he looks up he sees that his driveway is packed with four police cars, some unmarked and there are about five OFFICERS waiting to come into the house. \nABEL I understand. But as you can see this is a terrible time for us. I am having my daughter's birthday party. \nABEL is trying to remain calm and not lose his temper. \nPOLICE OFFICER I understand and I apologize, I do. But this is a warrant and we need to gain complete access to the property. \nThey stare at each other just as ANNA comes to the door. She sees the scene in her driveway. \nANNA What is this? \nPOLICE OFFICER Let me go check something. \nANNA Are they serious? \nABEL is seething and can only manage a slight nod. \nAs they look across the driveway they see the OFFICER talking to someone. The officer shifts out of the way and they see he is talking to ASSISTANT D.A. LAWRENCE. \nABEL I'm going to kill this guy. ANNA Abel. \nANNA is trying to get his attention quietly. \nABEL Abel. \nHe turns and they look at each other. She signals towards the library and they share a knowing, concerned glance. \nABEL (CONT'D) Give me five minutes. \nShe nods and heads down the path towards the police and LAWRENCE. Abel heads back in the doorway. \nABEL (CONT'D) Maria. Keep the kids playing for a few minutes. \nANNA walks up to the LAWRENCE. \nANNA Mr. Lawrence is it? \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE Yes. ANNA Anna Morales. \nShe reaches out her hand to shake his with a smile. \nANNA (CONT'D) May I speak with you for a minute. A.D.A. LAWRENCE (thinks, then) Yeah. \nThey walk away from the others down the driveway a stretch. \nANNA I understand you and your men have a job to do here. But we are in the middle of a seven-year-old's birthday party. \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE I understand, and I'm sorry. But we are coming in. She turns a little on him. \nANNA That's not a problem, as we have nothing to hide from you. It's just that, we recently moved to this area, and there are twenty guests in our house... please... can you give me five minutes so we can ask everyone to leave calmly before you come into my home? \nHe thinks this through. \nA.D.A. LAWRENCE You can get them out of the house. \nANNA Thank you. \nINT./EXT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY/DECK \n"}

{"test1_input": "ANDREW WALSH How was your talk? (nothing) I spoke with him after. He's going to keep going `til he gets the answer he's looking for. \nABEL I said I wouldn't do it. They sit for a long beat. \nANDREW WALSH I'm not sure we are in a position to say that. \nABEL What's that? \nANDREW looks around. He's getting paranoid. \nANDREW WALSH Do you want to go for a walk? \nABEL Are you really serious with this, this is what it's come to, walking around outside like fucking gangsters? \nANDREW WALSH I am and it is. \nEXT. STANDARD HEATING OIL TRUCK - DAY Throughout this conversation ABEL is walking over to a section of the yard where WORKERS are loading some sort of additive chemical to the fuel trucks. \nANDREW WALSH It is looking like we must do this. \nABEL I must? \nThis gets a little personal. \nANDREW WALSH They will shut you down. \nABEL These men, they work for me. These trucks they drive, the customers they serve. They are here because we built this. \nANDREW WALSH That's true, until its not. And the last person in the world right now that we need working against us is the president of the fucking teamsters. This company is out of business in a month if he gets these guys to walk. We are running out of cash. \nABEL What are you even talking about here? \nANDREW WALSH The union provides a handgun and a permit to every one of the drivers. And they think this whole thing is over in a week. \nABEL These men are fucking truck drivers. This is insane. You know who is gonna get it in the end here, me. This comes back to me. \nANDREW WALSH It does either way. \nABEL I'm not doing it. \nANDREW WALSH Would you put everything at risk to stand by that. \nABEL thinks this through. \nABEL It will be the end of everything I have worked for. If one of these guys shoots somebody it's me they will bring down for it...I'll talk to him... And we need to close this deal. We can't stay like this any longer. We must close on that property... We are so weak right now. \nThey are now standing on top of one of the trucks tanks as a worker pours the additive into the tank. The container says \"GREEN DYE #7\" on it. ABEL looks down as it flows in. \nHe stands up and looks out across the fence at the container property. \nANDREW WALSH Why do you want this so badly? ABEL Because I have my entire savings at risk with this deposit. It is everything. \nANDREW WALSH That's not what I mean. Why did you want it so badly in the first place? It was a risk... always. \nABEL thinks this through. \nABEL I don't know. \nANDREW WALSH You don't know? Have you ever thought about it? \nABEL I've thought about it every day for the last five years. This place was sitting over that fence mocking.... \nANDREW WALSH I didn't mean have you ever thought about that place... (MORE) \nANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) I mean have you ever thought why you want it so badly? ABEL I don't know what you mean. \nABEL looks to him in a sincere way wanting him to answer but ANDREW just waits. Finally. \nABEL (CONT'D) I know what you are asking and no... I never ask myself why I do this. It just feels right... wanting to be bigger feels better. It feels right. \nANDREW WALSH That's very simple. \nABEL Yes... \nWith this he gives him a deadly serious look. \nABEL (CONT'D) ...It is. ANDREW WALSH You take these risks... \nABEL Only when necessary. \nANDREW WALSH We have to get going, we need them to show up. \n", "test1_true": "ANNA leads the boys to the table, and we see a whole new side to her. She is going to get this done. As they approach the table we see two BANKERS stand to greet them. The Bank President, ARTHUR LEWIS, and Bank VP IAN THOMPSON. \nANNA Arthur. \nARTHUR LEWIS Anna, you look amazing as always. \nANNA Thank you. \nARTHUR LEWIS Gentlemen. Do you know Ian Thompson? One of our new VP's. \nANNA Ian. \nThey all shake hands and sit. The WAITER comes over. \nWAITER So what can I get you to drink? \nABEL A lot. \nAwkward laughter. \nABEL (CONT'D) A wine list please. \nWAITER I'll be right back. \nARTHUR LEWIS So how are you? ABEL We've been better... but we are good. \nARTHUR LEWIS Yes I heard about that... if you stay in business long enough it's bound to happen eventually. \nANNA Well that's exactly right. And we wanted to sit down with you tonight to make sure we were being totally up-front with everything that is going on and make sure that you understand the nature of the complaints and are comfortable that it is not going to affect our business in an adverse way. \nANDREW WALSH Did you have a chance to look over the outline that I sent over? \nARTHUR LEWIS Yes, we did. \nANNA Hopefully it made clear that even in a worst case situation we will pay off any and all fines and be able to move forward with very comfortable capital on hand. \nABEL jumps in taking some offense. \nABEL But you should know Arthur that this man has been digging through our industry for over two years looking for anything he can find. And as you know probably better than anyone, having worked with some of our competitors the thought that he would have singled us out is ridiculous. It reeks of everything that is wrong with this city right now. We run a fair and clean business and follow every standard industry practice and I will fight `til my last day to prove that... This silences the table for a long beat. \nABEL (CONT'D) But... but... \nABEL holds up his finger and points at ARTHUR across the table to make his point. \nABEL (CONT'D) ...Don't think for a moment that I am going to allow this mess to interfere with our plan to grow. We need to know you are standing by us. \nBANK VP IAN THOMPSON Yes, what is it with this piece of property that you find so integral or that can't be put off `til after this legal matter is dealt with? \nABEL is a little taken aback by this comment. It goes against everything that comes naturally to him as a person. ANNA and ANDREW know this and are concerned he might go off. \nABEL thinks it through. \nABEL That's a very good question. This property gives us many things... firstly direct access to the river. So I can bring in fuel directly from any provider in the world straight to my tanks, then it has over 10 million gallons of storage capacity, so I can buy in the summers when my price is low and sell to my customers and most importantly some of my competitors when the price is high. I won't just drive trucks anymore... I will control my fate... but the real answer to your question... \nNow ABEL stares right at IAN THOMPSON. \nABEL (CONT'D) ... is that when it feels scary to jump Ian... that is exactly when you must jump... or you risk ending up staying in the same place your whole life... and that I can't do. IAN THOMPSON awkwardly laughs a bit as ABEL just stays deadly serious staring right at him. Finally. \nARTHUR LEWIS We've always been there with you and know that we will continue to be. \nINT. ABEL'S CAR - NIGHT \nABEL is driving, and ANNA sits in silence looking out the passenger window. They are heading along the main backwoods road to their house. \nANNA Well, that went about as well as could be expected. \nABEL Yes. Arthur is a good man. \nANNA Do you think they will close? \nABEL Of course. \nJust as he says this a deer comes running out in front of them. ABEL tries to slam on the brakes but isn't able to stop in time. The car hits the deer and it careens over the windshield and on to the road behind the car. \nHe continues to slam on the brakes and comes to a complete stop. \nThey both catch their breath and look around to make sure they are both okay. Then they look back at the deer. It is laying on the road but is still breathing. \nABEL (CONT'D) Are you okay? \nANNA Yes... you need to go put it out of its misery. \n", "test1_id": 1788, "test2_input": "ANDREW WALSH I'm sorry? \nABEL This plea has me... \nANDREW WALSH I know. It's just a first offer. ABEL I would never take this. \nANDREW WALSH I know. \nABEL looks off and resets. \nANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) He's going to get us the meeting. \nABEL Who? \nANDREW WALSH Lawrence, he's tight with O'Leary. \nABEL Of course he is. \nANDREW WALSH Does Julian have anything? \nABEL gives him a look? \nANDREW WALSH (CONT'D) Anything on us? \nABEL All the drivers could have us on scales. Why? \nANDREW WALSH If we are cutting deals, we can't have anything new come up at the last minute. \nABEL He would never do that. \nANDREW WALSH We need to find him... Lawrence needs him. \nINT. JULIAN'S APARTMENT - DAY \nABEL stands outside the door for a very long beat then finally knocks. \nJULIAN'S wife, LUISA, opens the door. She gestures him in. \nHe enters the apartment and looks around. She gestures for him to sit. He chooses a seat right across from her. He stares at her for a beat. Then for the first time we hear him speak Spanish. (This whole conversation is in Spanish) \nABEL Thank you for letting me in. \nLUISA Of course. \nABEL moves his chair closer. It's meant to be, and is a bit threatening. \nABEL Have you seen Julian? \nLUISA No. \nABEL questions her with a look. \nABEL We need to find him. \nLUISA I know. \nABEL I am worried about him. \nLUISA So am I. ABEL You know we were going to support him. I do not know why he ran. \nLUISA He was scared. ABEL shakes his head. \nABEL I know. \nLUISA He has always wanted to make you proud. You know that right? \nABEL Yes. Well this time that hasn't worked out. \nLUISA No... How did you do it? ABEL Do what? \nLUISA This. \nShe motions towards his suit. \nLUISA (CONT'D) Success... that's all he wanted. \nABEL I know. It makes me very sad, because he is a very talented young man. But there are some decisions that you cannot come back from. I need to know where he is. And I need him to turn himself in. His actions are hurting me and my business. And I refuse to let other people's weaknesses hurt me. I don't know how it has come to this, but it has. If he does the right thing I will help to take care of his responsibilities. You and your family. When you see him. Tell him this. Please. \nLUISA I will. ABEL gets up and starts looking around the apartment a bit. He walks over to a small cabinet. \nABEL Does he have any money? \n", "test2_true": "ABEL Money? Has he taken money out of your bank account? \nLUISA I don't know? \nABEL You need to start looking into these things. It is very important that we find him safely. \nAnd with that JULIAN comes smashing out of the tiny cabinet where he was hiding and knocks over ABEL. JULIAN runs to the front door with ABEL chasing him. \nHe starts flying down the stairs at top panic speed. ABEL follows him down half the flight and realizes it is useless. \nABEL (CONT'D) (IN ENGLISH) Stop! Stop running away! Andrew! He's coming your way! \nThis is screamed at the top of his lungs but JULIAN never stops. We just hear his footsteps going down. \nINT. BOTTOM/TOP OF JULIAN'S STAIRWELL - DAY \nANDREW comes up the first few steps and we see him waiting for JULIAN. \nABEL then looks back up the half flight of stairs and sees LUISA standing there in the hall. He walks back up to her in an aggressive way. We fear for her. He gets right up in her face but does not touch her. \nABEL (in Spanish again) I understand why you lied, but it is not smart. (MORE) \nABEL (CONT'D) There are other people looking for him. I am as good an option as he has. Know this. \nAnd with that he heads down the stairs. \nEXT. BACK OF JULIAN'S APARTMENT/PARK STAIRS - DAY \nJULIAN is running out the back of the building and down a huge exterior staircase that is in a small park. He is about half way down when ANDREW gets to the top. ANDREW screams. \nANDREW WALSH Fuck You! You better run! \nINT. A SLIGHTLY RUNDOWN CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nABEL sits across a table from an OLD MAN in his late-70's who seems to have early-onset dementia and a WOMAN in her early- 20's, LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ who's overweight, but confident. The old man, SAUL LEFKOWITZ, just sits there through the scene. \nABEL Thank you both for agreeing to meet with me. \nLORRAINE LEFKOWITZ Of course. \nABEL I think we have met before but I didn't realize you were Saul's Granddaughter. \nLORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I am. \nABEL I'm sorry to ask but how old are you? \nLORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I'm 23. \nABEL Oh. \nLORRAINE LEFKOWITZ My Grandfather didn't trust any of his children to run the business. \nABEL Yes. LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ I know that you tried to buy the company from my Grandfather several times. \nABEL Yes. LORRAINE LEFKOWITZ His goal was to stay healthy long enough to be able to give the company to me. Which he thankfully did. \nThey both give a slight smile. \nLORRAINE LEFKOWITZ (CONT'D) So, while I appreciate your visit we are still not for sale. \nABEL I understand. And I hope that your Grandfather was able to communicate to you how much I have always respected him. And it was only out of respect for the business he had built, and because I knew of his reservations and feelings about your uncles and your father that I made those offers. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ I understand. \nABEL But, I am not here to offer to buy your company. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ Oh. \nABEL As I'm sure you will soon learn some years are good... others not so. I am in contract with a significant hard deposit at risk to purchase the old Bayfront terminal. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ I see. \nABEL And due to circumstances beyond my control my bank has left me at the altar. \nLORAINE LEFKOWITZ I'm sorry. \nABEL So, I am here, hat in hand, looking for a loan. I certainly expect the terms to be in your favor as I could not be at a weaker place. But, if your Grandfather trusted you with his company, I would be willing to trust you as my lien holder. \nThey all stare at each other. Then the old man shifts in his chair. \nSAUL LEFKOWITZ How much? \n", "test2_id": 1789, "test3_input": "PETER FORENTE That was very well said last night. \nABEL Thank you. And thanks for seeing me. \nPETER FORENTE Of course. So what is it? \nABEL I need a loan. \nPETER'S face scrunches up like he tasted a lemon and he turns away for a beat. Then comes back. PETER FORENTE You don't want to do that. \nABEL No shit... but I'm here. \nPETER FORENTE What are we talking about here. \nABEL Six hundred thousand. \nPETER FORENTE Jesus. Abel, that's a problem. \nABEL Yes... but if I don't get it... \nPETER FORENTE What's my collateral? \nABEL The terminal. PETER FORENTE Yeah me and how many other people will be coming after it. No way. \nABEL You'll get your money. \nPETER FORENTE Abel, you know I respect everything you've done. Because of it we haven't come down on you the way I should have for coming into my service area and poaching my customers. You're good at what you do, probably better than us, and I accept that. But this would be different. I don't want you to be in this position. We are not nice people to borrow three quarters of million dollars from. \nABEL I know that. \nPETER FORENTE Let's sleep on this. Both of us. \nINT. ABEL AND ANNA'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT ABEL comes in as ANNA is sitting at the table smoking. He walks over and sits down at the table with her. \nShe gives him a great sly smile. \nANNA What a day. ABEL Yeah. \nANNA Are you okay? \nABEL Yes. \nANNA Car chases? \nABEL Yeah. \nANNA Who knew? \nShe gives him a loving look. \nANNA (CONT'D) How was your brother? \nABEL He seemed good... But the girls up at that place are... \nANNA Stop. \nABEL I can tell you the girls didn't look like that where I went to school... \nANNA Enough. \nAfter a brief light moment the cloud comes back over him. \nABEL How are we here? \nANNA It was a lot of things all at once. ABEL Yeah. \nANNA How did it go? \nABEL We can probably pull it off. Three different parties... it'll be a mess... and the terms... Peter suddenly showed me his true colors. \nHe lets out a brutal sigh. \nANNA I'm sorry. \nABEL I spent my whole life trying not to become a gangster... \nANNA I know. ABEL ...And now... on the biggest deal in my career they will all control me. \nHe sits there for a long beat and then she comes and hands him a piece of paper with a series of numbers on it. He looks up at her. \nABEL (CONT'D) What is this? \n", "test3_true": "ABEL just waits for more but gets nothing. \nABEL Whose? \nANNA Ours. \nABEL How much is in it? \nANNA A lot. ABEL What does that mean? \nANNA It will help. You could replace Peter's money and get him out of the deal. ABEL Where did it come from? \nANNA Abel. \nABEL Where did it come from? \nShe stops and thinks, then: \nANNA Since 1971 I have been skimming money out of the company. Some years a little... others a lot. In the beginning it was just in case times got tough but then it was because you were taking all these chances... I didn't know what else to do... I couldn't risk having us be left with nothing. \nThis knocks him back. \nANNA (CONT'D) I'm sorry. \nABEL What do you expect me to do with this? \nANNA Use it.... Abel... \nABEL Is it clean? \nANNA What does that mean? \nHe thinks that through. \nABEL It means if you walked into the office of the people who have been trying to put us in jail right now and slapped a check from that account down on their desk would it push me further into hell or help to get me out? \nANNA It's as clean as every other dollar we've ever made. \nABEL That's a fucking bullshit answer. \nANNA I can clear it on the books. \nABEL Well it sounds like you should take this money and keep it right where it is... because I'm going to pretend that we never had this conversation. And you can use that when they drag me off to jail! With that he tries to get passed her and head upstairs. She follows and is standing looking up at him. \nANNA So what's your plan here? \nHe turns to her and squares off. \nABEL I'll get it done. And it won't be as a cheat. \nANNA (Yelling, but controlled enough to not wake the kids.) Oh you are too much. You've been walking around your whole life like this all happened because of your hard work, good luck, and charm. Mr. Fucking American Dream. Well this is America... but it's not a dream, and that wasn't good luck helping you out all those years... IT WAS ME! Doing the things you didn't want to know about... \nABEL You stole from me! This stops her in her tracks. And eventually a little smile comes across her face. She comes way down and almost delivers this line in a whisper. \nANNA Oh... You have always been very good about not letting your ego get in the way of business. Don't start now just because it's me. \nWith that ABEL turns up the stairs and heads to bed. \nINT. MASTER BATHROOM - MORNING \nABEL is getting ready for the day shaving. He looks exhausted. ANNA comes into the room. She stands at the entryway just looking at him for a very long beat. \nABEL We'll use the money... your money. It's the smart play. ANNA It's our money. \nABEL I know... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nBefore we see anything, we hear the sound of a pen writing on paper. \nINT. THE TEMPORARY OFFICE TRAILER - DAY \nABEL and ANDREW are sitting around the folding table opposite the HASIDS. ABEL signs the document and then picks it up and heads outside. \nEXT. TEMPORARY TRAILER - DAY \nABEL comes out and we see ANNA standing outside the trailer in the cold because these guys don't do business with women. He hands her the document. Under her breath: \nANNA These fucking guys...what's this additional $11,000? \nABEL I guess there is still some fuel in two of the tanks... they gave us a fair price on it. \n", "test3_id": 1790}

ON COCHRAN 
He slips while he's blocking Butler who takes 
advantage of the situation and blows by him. 
ON SHANE 
He's got Franklin crossing in the end zone. He cocks and throws, and simultaneously gets decked by Butler. 
ON BALL 
A Dallas defensive halfback     goes up for    it but just tips the ball. It      keeps going    now end over end... right into     the waiting    arms of Franklin who is standing     by himself    in the end zone. 
Franklin is shocked.   His teammates run INTO FRAME and mob him. 
AL (V.O.) Touchdown, Skins!     What a fluke! 
BOOMER (V.O.) Total luck there, Al. Makes up for the perfect ones they drop. 
DAN (V.O.) Maybe not so lucky. Falco is down. 
ON SHANE 
He's on his back. 
ON ANNABELLE 
She looks worried as trainers run out onto the field. 
ON O'NEIL AND AUGUSTINE 
They're watching in O'Neil's bedroom. 
ON SHANE 
Trainers are bending over him.      He's out but 
he's mumbling: 
SHANE Put your tits on my head... 
A trainer hears that and looks worried. 
Shane's teammates run up and carry him off the field. 
ON FRANKLIN 
He's holding for Pacifico on the extra point. 
On the snap, Franklin bobbles the ball but manages to put it down. 
Pacifico belts it through the uprights. 
Scoreboard:    Dallas 24, Washington 21. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. SIDELINE - DAY 
Shane is sitting on the bench holding his head and his side. He's talking quietly to McGinty. 
ON WILKINSON 
He's on the field calling for a fair catch. He makes it. 
AL (V.O.) ... one minute twenty remaining, and even though Dallas didn't score, they sure ate up a lot of the clock. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - WILKINSON 
He's leading the offense out onto the field. 
BOOMER (V.O.) And it looks like Falco cannot answer the bell. He's still on the bench 
and it    appears that safety    Earl Wilkinson will be    leading the Redskin    offense. 
DAN (V.O.) They just need to get the ball in field goal range. 
AL (V.O.) And for Pacifico, that's anything up to sixty-five yards. 
ANOTHER ANGLE - WILKINSON 
He takes the snap from the shotgun and keeps the ball on a sweep. He plows for twelve yards. 
AL (V.O.) That's good for twelve yards. The clock stops on the first down. The Redskins have no time- outs left. 
ON SHANE 
McGinty is still bent over him. 
McGINTY I need your hands in there for the field goal. I can't trust Franklin to hold. He almost dropped the extra point. 
Shane is in major pain but nods his head. 
SHANE I can do it. 
ON WILKINSON 
He rolls again, but no one is open. He crosses the line of scrimmage, is hit and goes down. 
ON CLOCK 
It continues to run and passes twenty seconds as we watch. 
ON REDSKINS 
They're hurrying back to the line of scrimmage. Wilkinson stands over center.

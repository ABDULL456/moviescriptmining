From out of the darkness... 
RENEE'S HAND 
ENTERS FRAME, gently touching Geoff's side. And with its arrival, so comes her eerie LULLABY. 
RENEE (a whisper) I need you, Geoff... 
GEOFF 
slowly raises his head, bewildered. Renee's hand withdraws into the darkness. He reaches out for her, but she's gone. The LULLABY remains, beckoning from down the attic stairs. 
The attic door slowly swings open of its own accord. 
Geoff rises from the bed and follows. 
INT.  DOWNSTAIRS FOYER - NIGHT 
Geoff looks into the living room as he passes. Marjorie has fallen asleep on the sofa with the TV on.

EXT.  PET SEMATARY - NIGHT 
The lullaby drifts from beyond the deadfall. The fog rolls inward, towards the distant burial ground. As Geoff moves towards the deadfall, the fog converges around him.

EXT.  THE BOG - NIGHT 
The lure of Renee's lullaby pulls Geoff deeper into the woods. We hear the unearthly ANIMAL HOWL once more. 
159   OMITTED THRU 167   OMITTED 
EXT.  PLEASANTVILLE CEMETERY - NIGHT 
Chase's van pulls to a stop behind a maintenance vehicle. 
Chase is greeted by the limping CARETAKER, who quickly leads him off across the rolling hillside. 
CARETAKER ...sorry to disturb you, Doctor Matthews, but I thought you'd want to come have a look for yourself. It's the damndest thing... 
AT RENEE'S GRAVE - 
Chase stops cold, gazing at the ground before him in disbelief... 
The grave is a gaping cavity. The casket has been unearthed. Renee's body is missing. 
CHASE Jesus... (uncomprehending) Gus did this?! 
CARETAKER (nodding) He stuck around after the funeral. Told me he had an order to exhume your wife. I didn't think much of it until I saw him drag the body out of the coffin... (shakes his head) He put your wife in his truck and drove off right through Amanda and Drew's headstones... 
The caretaker points across the hillside... 
TIRE TRACKS cut through the manicured grass, cutting a path of destruction right through the field of headstones and on through the fence. 
CARETAKER I swear, nothing this weird has happened since Louis Creed dug up his boy... (beat) You want me to notify the authorities? 
Chase doesn't answer, he just storms past the caretaker. 
INT.  VAN - NIGHT 
The van is speeding down the dark, open highway. Chase is on the car phone, frantic, waiting as it RINGS. There's finally an answer... 
CHASE Doctor Yolander, this is Chase Matthews, we spoke the other day... 
Yolander cuts him off. 
YOLANDER'S VOICE (bitter) You didn't leave town, did you. 
INT.  YOLANDER'S HOUSE (INTERCUT) 
Yolander sits in the darkness, a bottle of whiskey and a tumbler at his side. His "creatures" are all around him, eyes glowing with reflected moonlight. His voice is slurred. The voice of someone who's already damned. 
YOLANDER You sorry bastard. You stayed. I have nothing more to say to you, Matthews... 
CHASE'S VOICE (desperate) Look, just tell me one thing. Did I treat an animal that had been brought back to life? Did I?! 
YOLANDER What do you think? 
INT.  CHASE'S VAN - NIGHT 
Chase grips the carphone tightly, his knuckles white. 
YOLANDER (V.O.) Believe what you saw, Matthews. The dog was dead. 
CHASE My God... (mounting horror) ...how is that possible? You have to help me, Doctor Yolander. I don't know what I'm dealing with here! They've dug up my wife... 
YOLANDER'S VOICE (cutting him off) I'm retired from my practice, Matthews. It's your practice now, and it's your problem. (beat) God help you...

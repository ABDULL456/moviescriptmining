Frank and Sarah, holding their Tranq pistols, fly down the corridor. 
SARAH This way. 
They shear off the main corridor into the side corridor. Carter lies crumpled up ahead. Sarah slides to his side. Carter's head rests in a pool of blood. She checks his pulse while Frank takes a protective position. 
SARAH (cont'd) Pulse is weak. Breathing... shallow. 
FRANK He'll be okay. 
SARAH It's pretty severe. We have to get him to the lab. 
FRANK He's got to be okay. 
Frank stands frozen. 
SARAH For godsakes, help me. 
Frank snaps to. Grabs an arm. The pair hoist Carter up and carry him down the hallway. 
INT. OBSERVATION ROOM 
Linda pulls a handle and doors slide shut behind them. 
MATT He was going to kill me. 
Linda pulls him close. 
LINDA I know. He's gone. 
MATT We've got to got out of here. 
Linda checks the screen -- see Sarah, Frank and Carter headed toward the Laboratory. 
MATT (cont'd) Where is he? Goddamnit, where is he? 
Isolated in the Hallway of Habitats is a single blip. 
LINDA Habitats. 
MATT Oh god. That's right between us and the lab. 
INT. LABORATORY 
Frank and Sarah lift Carter onto a medical table. 
SARAH His pulse is faint. 
Sarah grabs a sheet from the counter top. Folds it and presses it against the head wound. 
SARAH (cont'd) He's lost a lot of blood. Here. Hold this. 
She guides Frank's hands to the wound. 
SARAH (cont'd) Keep applying pressure. 
Sarah pulls out a saline solution I.V. bag and slap it on the rack. She fumbles with the needle as she tries to find a vein. 
SARAH (cont'd) Don't move your hand until I got back. 
Sarah heads to the door. 
FRANK Where are you going? 
SARAH This'll hold him but he needs blood. 
FRANK But... 
SARAH Supply is right down the hall. I'll be two seconds. 
FRANK Sarah, wait for the others 
SARAH If I wait, he'll die. Keep pressure on the wound. 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Sarah exits the lab. Checks the corridor. Down at the end of the cramped tunnel is the supply room. 
She swallows her fear and heads toward it, all the while glancing side-to-side and behind her. 
INT. SUPPLY ROOM 
Spooked, Sarah bursts into the room. She goes to the supply fridge/freezer, pulls open the door, and sorts through blood bags.

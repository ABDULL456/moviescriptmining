{"test1_input": "IN THE BEDROOM \nWritten by \nRob Festinger & Todd Field \nFADE IN: \nTHE SOUND OF WIND AND NOTHING ELSE \nEXT. GI'S POINT \nWe are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers. A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years younger, in hot pursuit. Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace. \nCLOSER NOW We see them in glimpses: Their eyes - Lips - Hands Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest. She reaches out and strokes his hand. He stares at their fingers mingling together. The woman sighs. \nWOMAN I Love it here. I know you do... \nWOMAN I can feel my life - ya know. He stares up into the boughs above him and sHd.les. A legend appears: Il -_ 1 THE SOUND OF BALLGAmE OVER: \nT. RURAL ROUTE 90 - PREDAWN A BLUE 1973 CHEW PICK-UP winds around a corner and disappears down a long stretch of road. \"And that's it from Fenway the final score Oakland 3 t1 Redsox 7. You have been listening to the re-broadcast of last night's game. This broadcast is the sole property of -- -)r League Baseball and cannot be-\" - \nEXT. EMERSON ROAD - S \nThe truck pulls onto a small road flanked by rows of 100 year old clapboard two-story affairs. \nEXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - S \nStanding. on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from the opening scene, NATALIE STRUT, prett - eautifl actually with a little more sleep. She stands wit two small boys who are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air. Her son JASON 8 , and his brother DUNCAN 4, who has his face buried in his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen. The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young, early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his face full of warmth. He walks over to Natalie and gives her a kiss. The young man from the opening scene, rRANK FOWLER. The other man leans back against the passenger door. He is in his early 50's. Kind face, good looking, athletic in his day - Frank's father, MATT. He smiles at Natalie. Natalie smiles back. \nNATALIE Morn'in Dr. Fowler. \nMATT Morn'in Natalie. How you doing boys? \nJASON Great! Jason starts for the truck. Matt opens the door and the boy climbs inside the cab. Frank kneels down to Duncan. \nF Hey buddy ... you upset that you're not coming? Frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder. Duncan pulls away. Frank looks up to Natalie for help. \nF He can come if he wants ...we can manage, really. She smiles and shakes her head. \nNATALIE ahead. He wants to stay here. \nF Don't worry Dunk. You can come next time. ,Qy Natalie kisses him and they're off. \nINTO TRUCK - SAME - MOVING Jason in the middle. He glances over to Frank - a trace of hero :worship in his face. \nI NT. STROUT & SONS CANNERY - DAWN Sardines are processed at lightening speed. We follow them on their journey, which ends with the sealed cans being packed into cardboard shipping boxes. They are taped shut by a young man we will meet later (TIM, 3 ) . The tops read STROUT & SONS. \nI NT. ATKINS LOBSTER CO-OP - DAWN A double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping. Several men turn their bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing, while making morning small talk - The starting price of lobsters, the prospect of repairs to their equipment, and so on. A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been used as a scratch pad for years. Two scales are emptied of RED FISH into a PLASTIC PICKLE BUCKET. \nEXT. HARBOR - SAME \nA pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway. The bucket sways directly over them. A small hand struggles with the weight of the thing. A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear - the shoes stop. A strong hand grabs hold of the handle - the shoes pick up the pace. \nEXT. HARBOR - S \nMatt & Frank prepare the rig. Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a collection of SCARRED BUOYS, GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem exotic. Jason's eyes find the hull of \"GIGI\" an old Boudreau built lobsterboat. Starboard side covered in barnacles. \nF C'mon up Jace. \nMATT Hold on a second. Need to know if he's ready first - Jason, can you tell me what's important? Jason hesitates. \nF on tell h\u00b0 \nJASON \n", "test1_true": "L He takes a breath. \nJASON and the way the back of a baby's neck smells if its mother keeps it tidy.\" \nMATT \n(TO FRANK) You taught h' well. Jason beams. \nMATT - come aboard sailor. Matt reaches down to give a hand up. Frank turns the engine over. It roars to life. \nEXT. HARBOR LATER \nThe sun is fast climbing into the morning sky as \"GIGI\" glides out of the channel and past a LIGHTHOUSE that sits Just off the point of a good sized ISLAND. Jason shields his eyes with his hand. He gazes out at the island. Matt comes up beside him and sticks a baseball cap onto his head. The crown reads U.S.S. CONSTELLATION. \nJASON Thank you. \nMATT Ever been over there? \nJASON No sir. \nMATT It's beautiful. Isn't an island anymore though. It's a city. They have electric lights. Artesian wells, even a jail lighthouse isn't manned anymore - it's run by a computer When I lived there, had no ferry then` so we didn't even have cars, can you believe that? \nJASON How'd you get back? \nMATT Off the island? Jason nods. We rowed. Matt smiles at the memory. \nMATT Then we got a little outboard. That was great. A seven and a half horsepower it was - we lived there until I was about your age - then we left and became \"harbor people\". Jason seems to be digesting this. \nJASON I a \"harbor person\"? Matt hides a smile about to form. \nMATT Yep, Jason - we all are. Jason is full of questions. Matt knows the answers and doesn't talk down to him. Something the boy is grateful for. \nF At the helm. His eye s inted from glare and cold. He cuts back on the throttle s and heads for the winch. GLOVED HANDS pull up a BLUE-GREEN BUOY and slide the MANILA LINE into the WINCH. A POT surfaces and Frank sets it \"Doors up\" on the edge. He opens the doors. His hands work quickly and efficiently. He tosses a SMALL CRAB back into the water, pulls out a LOBSTER and measures the back. Too small. Then a nice sized LOBSTER is pulled out - it's missing the SCISSOR CLAW. He hands it to Matt. Baits the trap. Throws the winch and the next pot surfaces. Matt sits inside, Jason on his lap. He reaches into a WOODEN BOX of RUBBER BANDS with a BANDING WRENCH and bands the crustacean's remaining CRUNCHER CLAW. Jason stares at the disfigured creature. \nMATT Oh boy you see what happened to this poor fel ow? \nJASON .what? \nMATT Well, the trap has nylon nets called heads--2 side heads at b ends, so the lobster can crawl in. The \"Bedroom\" head inside, holds the bait and keeps it from escaping--you know the old saying \"two's company three-s a crowd\"? Jason nods. \nMATT Well{ it's like that. You get more than two in a bedroom and chances are something like this is going to happen. That's why Frank can't leave these traps for more than a day. Matt holds up another Lobster and turns it belly-up. There are black balls on both sides of the tail. \nMATT Now the older females like this of gal, are the most dan erous - especially when they're growin' eyries. \nJASON Berries? \nMATT Eggs... .one of these can take out two males easy - Then you wind up with lobster you can't sell - and as for this fine lady, she gets off easy, the state says you have to let her go. Matt throws her back in the water. Holds up the other one to Jason. \nTT Can you handle this? Jason nods. \nMATT \n(GENTLY) You sure? He really isn't. Matt hands it to him. \nMATT Go ahead now, put it in the tank. Jason can't get the thing in the tank fast enough. \nEXT. FOWLER HOUSE - DAY \nLooking around, you see a big yard, double lot. The grass is manicured to per ection, someone takes a lot of pride in their garden. In the middle of this sits a two story cape, post Hopper/Wyeth, early 20th Century - simple, beautiful, d you on't freeze in the winter. The truck backs up into the driveway, Frank j s out, drops the gate. Resting on the bed is a LARGE BOX wit a line drawing of a SWING-SET. \nQ \nFRANK O.S. Hey, dad can you give me a hand? The transistorized sounds of a baseball qame. \n", "test1_id": 3051, "test2_input": "HENRY O.S. Franks how lon you gonna be parked there I'd like to un oad. The two of them regard each other. \nF \n(TO MATT) Give me a hand? \nTT \n(SMILES) Sure. \nI NT. FOWLER HOUSE - NIGHT - STAIRWAY Ruth comes down the stairs, wrapping her bathrobe around her, The Dining room light is on. \nTHE DININGROOM Frank sits at the t lea His drafting tools are out. He's fully immersed in a sketch. Ruth enters quietly. \nRUTH Your father is snoring. Don't mind me. She takes a container from the fridgge, smells it, makes a quenstioning face, then puts it back - grabs another container and opens a cupboard. Pulls out a loaf of bread. She quietly places a sandwich in front of him, and takes a seat. \nRUTH Eat---you must be hungry. Frank doesn't look up. his tone is flat, removed. \nF I'm not hungry. \nRUTH Coffee? He doesn't answer. Ruth sits there, awkwardly. \nRUTH So---you talked with her? \nFRANK Yep. \nRUTH d-,,how is she? \nF \n(SHARPLY) Oh, she's great. I just wanted to tell you that we I - liked her, Do like her. She's a \nWONDERFUL GIRL Frank finally puts down his pencil,',-and looks at her, \nF You're not reall going to have this conversation wit me now, Ma? Are you? Frank returns to his work. He doesn't look up again. \nShe leaves the food for him. Like a zoo keeper. \nEXT. HARBOR - DAY \nFrank hauls traps. He appears lethargic, dull - the hands a little slower. The eyes tired. The joy of the work, replaced by dread. \nINT. HENRY'S FISH SHACK - DAY \nHen sits alone at the wooden table. There are three plates of cod, and 3 soda-pops. Frank comes in exhausted. Henry looks up. \nHENRY You're nn'in late. Frank nods. Takes a seat, and starts in on the cod. Henry looks at the empty seat next to Frank. \nHENRY Where's our boy? Frank ignores the question. \nINT. FRANK'S TRUCK - DAY \nFrank drives. Traps stacked in the bed. He slows down to gaze out his window, as he passes \nNAT IE' S HOUSE. The truck crawls to a stop. He takes the moment, storin each detail: Folded up lounge chairs. Scattered toys on t 9e porch. A tipped-over tricyle. He idles, as if waiting for someone. After one last look he drives off. I NT. GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - E. ...g The sightsand sounds of men gathered around a poker table. A regular game. Everyone well into their umpteenth beer, with the exception of Matt, who nurses a can o Moxien, Matt frowns at his hand. He glances over to Frank r also at the table. Frank stares at his cards, but his nd is elsewhere. \nWILLIS You can't hypnotize the cards into changing, Matt. , late 50's, peers above his readin glasses. He is a lobster man by trade but fancies himself a poet. \nWILLIS For Christ's sake bet - or you know Carl's gonna start. Carl is indeed. \"The be gar's do and widow's cat, Feed them an thou wi t grow fat. The gnat that sings his s er's song- Collective groans. Poison gets from slander's tongue. The poison of the snake and newt- Is the sweat of envy's foot. The poison of the honey bee. Is the artist's jealousy-\" \nMATT Alright Carl. Two bucks. Matt throws his two bucks in. \nMATT Carl, you've really got to get off this Blake thing ... you're in a rut. Frank tries to smile. \nHENRY Don't get him going Matt. \n", "test2_true": "WILLIS MATT That's not true. No! we like your stuff. The place breaks up with laughter. \nWI IS Everybody in? Frankie you in? Frank calls. Hands are shown. All eyes to Frank. \nF \n(FORCED ENTHUSIASM) Guess I'm the winner. More groans, as Frank pulls in his winnings. \nWILLIS Always the quiet ones. The game continues --. \nI NT. FOWLER HOUSE WAY. DAY Frank walks down the hallway\u00b0talking on a cordless phone. His tone casual but serious. He jots down notes in a sketch book. \nF Sure. Right . I get in on the sixth. Oh, I'll send that out tomorrow, sir, no problem... Well, compared to your models no, they don't compare to your models \n(LAUGHING) He enters the: \nBEDROOM and plops down at his drafting table. \nFRANK I'm getting another call.

He listens. \nF I'll be right over. \n(FIRMLY) Just stay put. \n- T IE'S HOUSE - DAY The house looks like a storm hit it: chairs tipped over, toys scattered, papers strewn across the floor. \nG ROOM Frank looks around the room.

Frank eraces her. She buries her head in his neck. \nF Its okay, now. Listen to me, I'm not going anywhere ... \nINT. JASON'S BEDROOM - UPSTAIRS \nJason looks down from the window. He sees Richard's Suburban pull up front. \nJASON O.S. Mom!!! \nDOWNSTAIRS \nA POUNDING AT THE FRONT DOOR Natalie gives a horrified look to Frank. \nF Get them back upstairs. \nNATALIE But... \nFRANK Now. \nNATALIE Come on, you guys. Natalie hustles the boys upstairs. \nTHE POUNDING CONTINUES. Frank moves to the FRONT DOOR. He's about to check the doorknob when THE DOORKNOB JIGGLES from the other side. It's locked. \nF Richard, just get away fr here- Silence. Frank turns, his eyes lock on \n", "test2_id": 3052, "test3_input": "MATT I didn't use your name. \nRIC They'll figure that out too. You think I wouldn't have done it myself if it was that easy? Silence. He starts it up, slides into reverse. He looks back over his shoulder as they back down the driveway. Matt averts his stare. Looking down at the gun barrel but not at the profiled face beyond it. \nMATT You were alone. We've got it worked out. \nRIC .who's we? Good estion. Matt doesn't answer though. Richard shifts into drive. \nEXT. RICHARD'S CONDO - PARKING LOT - S \nThe Brown Suburban pulls out of the lot and onto the street. \nI NT. BROWN SUBURBAN - S \nRIC There's no planes this time of night, Dr. Fowler. \nMATT back through town. Then north on 73. \nRIC The airport's South... \nMATT Somebody's going to keep you for a while. They'll take you to the airport - turn on the radio. Find the game. \nRIC It's after three \nMATT They run it again. Matt leans back, quietly uncorking the hammer. \nMATT No more talking. Richard tries to read Matt \u00b0s face in the mirror, but it -s now in shadows. Richard fumbles with the radio, surfing the stations. Matt is right. The game is on. Nomar Garcia arra hits a long drive to left with runners in scoring position \"A cinch to collect 200 hits this season.\" Richard sets his eyes on the road. \nEXT. BROWN SUBURBAN - HIGHWAY 1 SOUTH - NIGHT \nThe Brown Suburban heads away from Old orchard, onto a small two lane rural hi hwayy. The road is flanked on both sides by open fields, and lonely capes. Few cars on the road. \nINT BROWN SUB /WISSC SET BRIDGE They come up over the high bride over the channel: to the left the smacking curling white at the breakwater and beyond that the dark sea and a full moon, and down to the right the small fishing boats bobbing at anchor in the cove. Swirling colors from behind catch their attention. Richard and Matt both look in the rear-view. A state trooper's car with its gumballs flashing races up in the distance behind them. Matt jams the gun into Richard's ribs and slouches down. \nMATT (Trying to stay ca ri ht take it easy - pull over to the shoo der. Matt & Richard sit tight waiting for the inevitable. The light gains in intensity, as the cab fills with crimson. \nEXT. WISCASSET BRIDGE \nThe cruiser tears right past them. Quickly fading into the distance. ? e \nI NT.

R ROUTE - SAME - NIGHT \nRichard slows, and makes a U-turn. His lights illuminate PRIVATE -ROAD and NO HUNTING signs. He takes a right, onto a dirt road flanked on both sides by fir trees. \nE .DIRT ROAD We track with the Brown Suburban as fir trees strobe in the foreground. \nIN/EXT. BROWN SUBURBAN - DIRT ROAD \nRIC There's nothing back here Dr. Fowler? I donut understand why you don-t just \nMATT It's for you're car. You don't think we'd leave it at the airport do you? \nMATT WATCHES RIC S LARGE, BIG KNUCKLED HANDS TIGHTEN ON THE WHEEL. They crawl up the trail, the wheels crunching the gravel, the headlights shining into the dense woods. The road seems endless. Richard cringes as they bounce over a bump. Both of them eagerly peer beyond the windshield. Finally, at a great distance, the tiny lit windows of a cabin come into view. A BLUE CHEVY PICKUP is parked in front of the place. \nMATT Stop here. The Brown Suburban crawls to a stop. Richard keeps the engine running. Matt presses the gun hard against his neck. He straightens in his seat and looks in the rearview mirror. Matt's eyes meet his in the glass for an instant before focusing on the hair at the end of the gun barrel. \nTT Turn it off. Richard does. The ball game disappears, and the silence is strangely a anent. He continues to hold the w eel with both hands. He ooks in the mirror. \nRIC I'll do twenty years, Dr. Fowler, I'll be fifty-four years old. \nMATT That's two years younger than I \nEXT. DIRT ROAD - S \nMatt gets out and k\u00b0cks the door shut. Richard opens his door. He doesn't move. Just sits in the interior light. His face now pleading. Matt can see it in his lips. \nMATT Get the bags. \nRIC- \n(TERRIFIED ) Where are we Dr. ?owler? \nMATT Almost there. Richard carefully gets out. Instinctively, he raises his hands about shoulder level. They move to the back of the Brown Suburban. Richard pops the hatch. He pulls out the two canvas bags. He sets them on the ground. He reaches in and pulls out the small suitcase. We hear a SCREEN DOOR slam shut. Richard looks surprised. He turns back to Matt. C'mon now. Richard reaches down and picks up the bags. He struggles to carry all three. Matt grabs the small suitcase from him. \nMATT That way. Richard lugs the bags toward the cabin. We hear HEAVY CRUNCHING FOOTSTEPS OF SOMEONE APPROACHING. Richard stops. \nWILLIS APPEARS FROM DOWN THE PATH. He nods to Matt. \nRIC Mr. Grinnel? \nWILLIS I'll get them, son. Willis takes the bags from Richard, turns, and carries them up the long path back to the cabin. RICHARD LOOKS S r \u0095E' RELIEVED. He waits a moment, u-sure of what to do. Finally, he starts wal'-.ing up the path after Willis. \nWait. Richard stops, \u00b0d-step. He tenses, waiting. \nMATT You can carry this one. Richard turns. \nLO He reaches out to take the bag from Matt. Matt keeps it at his side, and takes a step back, his gun trained on Richard. \nRICHARD CONNECTS WITH TT'S EYES. \nKNOWS. \nRICHARD DUCKS AND TAKES ONE STEP THAT'S THE BEGINNING OF A SPRINT. \nBOOM \nTHE GUN KICKS IN MATT'S HAND. \nTHE GUN'S REPORT ECHOES FOR ETERNITY. \nMATT STANDS ABSOLUTELY STILL. \nSTILL HOLDS THE LITTLE SUITCASE. \n", "test3_id": 3053}

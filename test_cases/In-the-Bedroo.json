{"train": "IN THE BEDROOM \nWritten by \nRob Festinger & Todd Field \nFADE IN: \nTHE SOUND OF WIND AND NOTHING ELSE \nEXT. GI'S POINT \nWe are in the midst of a field of tall grass wild flowers. A long rutted road stretches into the distance. Faintly at first and then closer - we hear a woman squealing with laughter. We see her legs cut through the grass and fly up a hill. Close on her heels is a young man, a good ten years younger, in hot pursuit. Over the field - across the tops of blades, sits an ancient apple tree. We rise out of the grass and see the two young people under the tree. They are entwined - in a deep embrace. \nCLOSER NOW We see them in glimpses: Their eyes - Lips - Hands Finally they part - the woman rests her head on his chest. She reaches out and strokes his hand. He stares at their fingers mingling together. The woman sighs. \nWOMAN I Love it here. I know you do... \nWOMAN I can feel my life - ya know. He stares up into the boughs above him and sHd.les. A legend appears: Il -_ 1 THE SOUND OF BALLGAmE OVER: \nT. RURAL ROUTE 90 - PREDAWN A BLUE 1973 CHEW PICK-UP winds around a corner and disappears down a long stretch of road. \"And that's it from Fenway the final score Oakland 3 t1 Redsox 7. You have been listening to the re-broadcast of last night's game. This broadcast is the sole property of -- -)r League Baseball and cannot be-\" - \nEXT. EMERSON ROAD - S \nThe truck pulls onto a small road flanked by rows of 100 year old clapboard two-story affairs. \nEXT. NATALIE'S HOUSE - S \nStanding. on the lawn in front of one of them is the woman from the opening scene, NATALIE STRUT, prett - eautifl actually with a little more sleep. She stands wit two small boys who are doing their best to stay warm in the morning air. Her son JASON 8 , and his brother DUNCAN 4, who has his face buried in his mother's coat--refusing to see or be seen. The truck comes to a stop and two men get out. One is young, early 20's, and even at this hour his step is lively, his face full of warmth. He walks over to Natalie and gives her a kiss. The young man from the opening scene, rRANK FOWLER. The other man leans back against the passenger door. He is in his early 50's. Kind face, good looking, athletic in his day - Frank's father, MATT. He smiles at Natalie. Natalie smiles back. \nNATALIE Morn'in Dr. Fowler. \nMATT Morn'in Natalie. How you doing boys? \nJASON Great! Jason starts for the truck. Matt opens the door and the boy climbs inside the cab. Frank kneels down to Duncan. \nF Hey buddy ... you upset that you're not coming? Frank reaches out and puts his hand on the boys shoulder. Duncan pulls away. Frank looks up to Natalie for help. \nF He can come if he wants ...we can manage, really. She smiles and shakes her head. \nNATALIE ahead. He wants to stay here. \nF Don't worry Dunk. You can come next time. ,Qy Natalie kisses him and they're off. \nINTO TRUCK - SAME - MOVING Jason in the middle. He glances over to Frank - a trace of hero :worship in his face. \nI NT. STROUT & SONS CANNERY - DAWN Sardines are processed at lightening speed. We follow them on their journey, which ends with the sealed cans being packed into cardboard shipping boxes. They are taped shut by a young man we will meet later (TIM, 3 ) . The tops read STROUT & SONS. \nI NT. ATKINS LOBSTER CO-OP - DAWN A double-55-gallon-drum wood stove is humping. Several men turn their bodies rotisserie-fashion around the thing, while making morning small talk - The starting price of lobsters, the prospect of repairs to their equipment, and so on. A SCARRED HAND scribbles some figures on a wall that has been used as a scratch pad for years. Two scales are emptied of RED FISH into a PLASTIC PICKLE BUCKET. \nEXT. HARBOR - SAME \nA pair of CANVAS TENNIS SHOES shuffle down a gangway. The bucket sways directly over them. A small hand struggles with the weight of the thing. A pair of BEACON FALLS waders appear - the shoes stop. A strong hand grabs hold of the handle - the shoes pick up the pace. \nEXT. HARBOR - S \nMatt & Frank prepare the rig. Jason stands on the dock, taking it all in. A field of LOBSTER POTS stacked like cordwood and surrounded by a collection of SCARRED BUOYS, GRAPNEL and coiled FISHING GEAR stiff with sea salt - all so wildly unreasonable as to seem exotic. Jason's eyes find the hull of \"GIGI\" an old Boudreau built lobsterboat. Starboard side covered in barnacles. \nF C'mon up Jace. \nMATT Hold on a second. Need to know if he's ready first - Jason, can you tell me what's important? Jason hesitates. \nF on tell h\u00b0 \nJASON \nEXT. FOWLER BACKYARD LATER \nFrank pushes Duncan, who sits proudly on his new swing-set. \nD C Higher! HIGHER! SMALL CHILDREN are everywhere. A serious Super Soaker Squirt Gun fight in progress. \nACROSS THE YARD a steaming hot grill, with a huge assortment of hot-dogs & burgers. A spatula flips a patty. The sounds of Fenwav park emanate from a chea Dort able radio. WILLIS GRINNEL, early 50's, a stout, silver-haired man, works the grill. Standing next to him is Matt, his best friend for forty plus years. Matt takes a pull off a can of Moxie. Sets it down and searches through a plastic bread bag. Willis looks past him, distracted. \nMATT h, Ruth hates this kind. What? \nMATT I bought the wrong buns. \nWILLIS Maybe we can borrow hers. Matt follows Willis's gaze, to the object of his distraction: A PRETTY WOMAN IN TIGHT DENIM SHORTS. She-s bent over to wipe the ketchup-stained face of Jason (he's wearing Matt's cap). \nWILLIS Ah, what I would give to have back my youth. \nMATT Willis, you never had that in your youth. The woman turns around and catches Willis staring. It's Natalia. Willis looks down, nonchalantly rifling through the bun bag. Matt waves to a passing man in khaki shorts, FATHER OBERTI, \n50-S- \nMATT Father! You made it! \nFATHER OBERTI Hey, if I don't see you fellas here, I don't get to see you at all. \nON F He backwards-hugs Natalie. \nF You want a beer? \nNATALIE I think I'll see if your Mom needs any help. \nFRANK Good luck. She laughs-He grabs and tickles her but she breaks away and escapes inside the house. Matt watches on, and falls into a wistful daydream. \nWILLIS Jealous? Matt turns to him and, to Willis's surprise, ever so slightly, nods. \nI NT. FOWLER HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - S Natalie walks in through the living room, pausing to examine a half finished ARCHITECTURAL MODEL that sits on a card-table next to a jigsaw puzzle. She looks toward the kitchen where a woman works at the sink. She takes a breath and starts there. \nI NT. FOWLER GARAGE - DAY \nOF THE GE Frank reaches into an old Westinghouse refrigerator. He pulls out a case of Schaeffer's and a six-pack of Moxie. He loads it all into a metal tub filled with ice. \nVOICE O.S. \nYO0 Frank, hunched over as he works, loo. ip at \nFRONT OF THE GARAGE TIM BRYSON, 22, still in his work clothes: He wears a White soiled smock. A\u00b0 patch on his Right pocket says STROUT & SONS. Over the left sply TIM. A hair-net nests on his head. \nF Thanks for coming by. Wooo, is that new cologne? You really oughta take a shower when you leave that place. \nTIM Very funny. \nF Take off that head dress, chief, and give me a hand? Tim reaches up and pulls the hair-net off his head. \nEXT - FOWLER HOUSE - DAY \nSIDE OF THE HOUSE Tim and Frank lug the heavy cooler around the house, heading toward the backyard. \nTIM So, Mr. Strout mentioned you again. \nFRANK I bet he did. \nTIM Seriously, man. He still talks about you coming back. Says you're the best can packer he ever had. Be nods. \nF He always was a nice guy. \nTIM \nRUTH Oh, no. \nEXT. FOWLER HOUSE - DAY \nMatt exits the house. \nACROSS THE YARD Duncan jumps off his swing and sprints. \nTO RICHARD who has just arrived. He stays at the far end of the yard. Duncan does a running jump into his father's arms. \nD C Daddy! Frank with Jason, looks up. Jason sees his father. He doesn't move. Natalie walks over to Frank, they exchange glances. \nNATALIE C'mon Jason. \nJASON No. \nNATALIE Now. Shedgrabs his hand. Straining to appear casual, traverses the \nYARD \nC DUN Richard play-boxes Duncan. Duncan looks up at his mother. \nD C Daddv's takino us to the arcade. \nRichard, eating Duncan's hot dog, rises to meet Natalie and Jason. \nRIC Hey there buddy --.Come on over here Jace- Jason looks away. \nDUN \n(TO JASON) I told you held come uttface- Jason reaches over and whacks Duncan on the head. \nRIC \n(ANGRY) Hey Jason - Don't do that to your brother. You want me to do that to you? He probably has. Jason backs away. Frank makes his way over to Natalie. \nAT THE GRILL Matt watches on- absently flipping burgers. Ruth comes over to h\u00b0 \nRUTH \nMATT \nMATT \nIT'S OK- Ruth shakes her head. Richard, Frank and Natalie are talking, but there are long pauses between words. Tim wanders over and says something to Richard Finally, Richard smiles, turns, and exits. Alone. Jason playfully chases Duncan across the yard. Frank and Natalie stay behind, talking quietly. Matt takes a breath, and exhales. He turns to Ruth with a comforting smile, but she's just entering the house. The screen door closes behind her. \n- FOWLER HOUSE - KITCHEN - S Ruth is at the counter pouring dressing onto a salad. Frank comes up behind her and hugs her. \nF Thanks for doing this mom. \nRUTH Are you alright? \nF Sure. Natalie and I want to take you and dad out tonight. \nRUTH Oh that's very sweet dear, but we already have plans. \nF You going over to the Grinnel's? Ruth shakes her head. \nRUTH \n(SMILES) Your father's taking me to the Strand. \nFRANK Oh, what are you seeing? \nRUTH The first film we ever saw together. \nRUTH Hmmmm. He won't listen to me. I asked him three times to dismantle that swing-set. \nMATT Oh, let it stay up. Looks like a young couple lives here. \nRUTH He needs his head in school. Not in her. \nMATT So to speak. Ruth pinches his shoulder. \nRUTH it would help if you were my side. \nMATT \n(PLAYFULLY) I'll get on your side. She laughs and pushes him away. \nINTO UNION CLINIC - WAITING ROOM - DAY A small waiting room with an alcove reception. ROCKWELL PRINTS adorn the walls, a long table covered with dog-eared periodicals, rests in front of a couch that has seen better days. ADAMSON 80's, glances over at her husband, ELWYN 80's,who vacantly thumbs through a HIGHLIGHTS MAGAZINE. He pauses to catch-up on the latest exploits of GOOFUS & GALLANT. The nurse, JANELLE 40's, calls out from the alcove. \nJANELLE O.S. Mr. and Mrs. Adamson? \nINT. UNION CLINIC - EXAMINATION ROOM \nElwyn sits bare chested on a table. Matt finishes bandaging his elbow - then listens to his chest with a stethoscope. He is careful and thoughtful. Alma looks to him. Worried. \nMATT You can put your shirt back on now. Alma stands and helps her husband dress. Yesterday he was up and around all afternoon, but toda - he tumbled. He's fallen down twice. have all I can do to get him up. He's weak and the longer you lay in bed - the weaker you get. \nMATT Elwyn, you need to do those exercises, you promised me, twice a day.

For a while he'd sit and just mend on nets - but he can't do that anymore. \nELWYN (speaks with difficulty) How's your dad Matt? I'm sorry Dr. now Elwyn you remember Jesse Fowler passed on somi&ime back, we were at the funeral. Remember? Elwyn nods. \nMatt knows. He's heard this before. Sometimes he feels more like a mechanic than a doctor, working on old cars with parts that have long been discontinued. He nods sympathetically. \nINT. MATT'S OFFICE HALLWAY LATER \nMatt pulls on his jacket. He passes Janelle in the hallway as he heads for the back door. \nMATT I'll be back in an hour. Forgot my lunch. \nJANELLE Starting to become a habit. I can get you something from Willis's. He's already out the door. \nEXT. HARBOR - SAME \nMatt trots down the gangway and up to where the \"GIGI\" is moored. He looks in. No sign of Frank. A VOICE BOOMS from a new 35ft.

She combs her hair through with her fingers, but her skirt, on backwards, is somewhat of a giveaway. Frank rolls his eyes. \nRUTH I see. \nINT. NATALIE'S CAR - DAY \nNatalie drives down Emerson Road. As she approaches her house, she sees a Brown Suburban sitting in her driveway. She looks confused. \nINT. NAT IE'S HOUSE - DAY \nTHE KITCHEN Natalie enters with groceries. Richard is seated at the kitchen table. He's finishing the first half of a sandwich. He drains a glass of milk. Natalie sets her purse down on the counter, and starts cleaning up his mess. \nNATALIE How'd you g et in this time? \nRIC \n(PLAYING ALONG) chimney. She takes the carton of milk that Richard, no doubt, left out. She pours the final drops into his glass \nRIC Thank you. She throws the carton out. She takes a seat, and stares at him like a teacher counselling a troubled youth. \nNATALIE What can I help you with? He kicks back the last of the milk, wipes his mouth. \nRIC I was just dropping that off for Jason. \nNATALIE What? \nRIC That. He points to a BASEBALL TROPHY sitting on top of the microwave. inscription bears his name and \"Rockland High School 1982 Regional Championship.\" \nRIC I didn't know where you'd want to put it. It was about time he got it. What am I going to do with it? Richard's wistful gaze stays locked on the trophy. For a moment, Natalie's and slips away. \nNATALIE I think it will mean a lot to him, Richard. He's really been improving lately ... \nRIC (a sharp turn) So I've heard. \nNATALIE It would have been nice if you'd come to his game. \nRIC I just got your message. Where are t with him? \nNATALIE That's none of your business. \nRIC I see. They're my kids but they're none of my business. \nNATALIE You know what I mean. \nE-?? Richard presses his fingers to his eyes. He takes a long, heavy breath. \nRIC I - - I was thinking about moving back. Here. With you and the boys. \nNATALIE What are you talking about? \nRIC What I talking about? I'm talking about moving back, that's what I'm talking about - I know what you're thinking, but it's different now. \nNATALIE Oh reall ? How's the job? Your father t ake you back on at the cannery? \nRIC \n(DRILY) That's funny. You're still getting checks aren't you? She ignores him \nRICHARD Ya see my new rig out there?

A moment. \nRIC You wantta take a ride? \nNATALIE \nF I'm boring you, aren't I? \nNATALIE \n(SOFTLY) No, not at all, I was just... . just thinking. \nF About what? \nNATALIE About you. . ,school, \nF I'd rather talk about our house. \nNATALIE I know you would. \nF What if I wait a year? \nNATALIE \nR \nF A year's not going to make a difference. \nNATALIE You can't do that, Frank. \nF I've thought a lot about this. \nNATALIE But you told me it takes forever just to establish yourself. \nF Exactl , so what's a year in forever? Know w at Duncan said today? She can't suppress a smile. \nNATALIE You wouldn't be changing the subject would you? \nFRANK Yes. \nNATALIE What now? \nF He said, \"Frank, I don't think Jason really understands girls.\" \nNATALIE \n(LAUGHING) He didn't! \nF He did ... \"understands girls!\" \nNATALIE What did you say? \nF I said, \"give him time, Duncan.\" They both break up. \nF I didn't know what to say! if this is how he is now - boy are we in trouble- He stops short. The word - We - hangs in the air. They watch each other, unsure of how to react. Changing the subject quickly. Frank reaches down to the grass and comes up with one of Duncan's toys. A real musclebound superhero. Somewhat grotesque. \nF (reading the tag) \nACTION MAN? \nNATALIE Richard gave it to Dunk for his birthday. \nFrank sets it down. The HEADLIGHTS OF APPROACHING CAR rake across ACTION \nI NT. ROCKLAND HIGH SCHOOL MUSIC ROOM - NIGHT Half a dozen girls age 15 to 18, are gathered in Ruth's classroom. Desks and chairs are stacked up for summer recess. The girls are in shorts and T-shirts, one with a picture of the solar system, and another with the Pink Panther. Bri ht bathing-suit straps are visible around some of their nec s: This afternoon they were sw' \u00b0ng. A few look sleepy enough to be in bed already. Ruth stands with her arms up- keeping time and controlling the dynamics. A single girl sings \"The Drone\"` a low monotone one hears underneath the other voices. They sing the Balkan folk song \"Oj Savice.\" \nCHORUS (SUBTITLED) Oh, Sava, carry me across our quiet cool water. There is my dear village and in that village, the prettiest girl. Without embarrassment, they shriek they drone, and at their ease they whistle. The music transports these girls - who are normally pre-occupied with images of MTV and Brad Pitt, to a place of pure self. The song ends. \nRUTH That was really good! OK it's 7:30 we should stop. The girls gather up their things quickly. \nRUTH Remember when you sing these words- The way we feel about the harbor, is how the Balkans felt about the river Sava. The girls start out of the room. \nRUTH Matt. \nI \nMATT %Q, We have to call them Frank. \nF It wasn't that serious. \nRUTH Of course. Just like the relationship isn't serious. \nHATT Ruth, this is not the time. \nRUTH Well, when is the time? After he knocks him into a coma? This is stopping. Now. \nF Oh really? \nRUTH Come Fall, you're on a plane. Are you taking them with you? How- do you think the boys will feel when you disappear? \nF \nHEY A \nRUTH This isn't just some sweetie from Vassar, that you'll see on holidays, Frank. You're not in this alone. Frank rises and leaves the room. \nRUTH Please listen. The sooner you end this thing the better. Ruth exhales. She returns to Matt, who is leaning against the recliner, chin in hand, deep in thought. \nRUTH What are we going to do? Matt deliberates. \nMATT I don't know. \nRUTH .you've got to talk to him. \nHATT I don't ow.,,I think he's right about scaring the kids. Why don't we call it a night? We'll deal with it tomorrow. \nRUTH Matt are you going to call the police or do I have to? You just ..s- Bd me what I think. if you want to call them. call them. \nRuth looks at him, stupefied. Without warning, Ruth leaves and goes upstairs. \nI NT. FOWLER HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT Ruth lies on her side reading. Matt comes in from the hallway. He stares at her. She ignores him. Finally, she turns over and faces him. \nRUTH It's not the first time she's played around. Matt seems relieved that she's talking to him. He sits on the bed and starts taking off his shoes. \nMATT She's not with the guy anymore. \nRUTH I mean from before. \nMATT What are you talking about? \nRUTH Oh, come on - you've heard the same things I have. \nMATT I think you forget. I don't take my lunch in the teachers lounge - \nRUTH Maybe he still loves her. Matt looks from Ruth, out the bedroom door, and into the hallway. He sees Frank rounding the top of the stairs. He gets up and closes the bedroom door. \nI NT. F R HOUSE F 'S ROOM - S Frank enters the room, pulls off his T-shirt and drops it on the floor. He walks over and faces a wall mirror.

They eat cod tongues and cheeks. Drink soda pop from bottles. \nHENRY Best part of the cod - but most outsi ers, they won't touch it. The shack is too warm and smells of cordage and paint, spilled beer and male sweat. Jason is in heaven. \nHENRY The summer fishermen, the part-timers, like Frank here - get in your hair. \nHENRY There's as many as 80 of em with licenses now - should put up a sign - \"Fish your own backyard or lose your traps0\" Frank smiles at Jason. \nFRANK A lobster is simple enough Jason. But if the guy going after him is even simpler well he might as well give up. \nTHE BACK-DOOR \nFrank races across the living room, just as THE DOOR FLIES \nOPEN.

He winces at the smoke. \nRUTH You slept late. For you. Matt pours himself some coffee. \nMATT I took one of your pills. \nRUTH You never do that. She turns the page, absorbed in an article. Shaking her head, she slaps the paper down. \nRUTH Well there it is in black and white. You should read some of the things he says. Unbelievable. Matt takes a sip of coffee. He glances down at the paper. He nods, without really looking. \nMATT yeah. He checks his watch. \nMATT I should get going. \nRUTH Where? It's Saturday. \nMATT I won't be gone long.

Makes change as another customer steps up. Matt steps near her, trying to maintain privacy. \nMATT \n(QUIETLY) How are the boys? Are they okay? Natalie, choked by emotion, cannot respond. Near tears, she puts her hand up, unable to speak. Matt reaches out to touch her arm. His gesture is interrupted as: She pulls the cigarettes from an overhead rack. The Man pays.

Matt turns to him, grinning. \nWILLIS Almost three hundred and fifty acres. Know what it went for when I bought it? You don't want to know. Matt continues surveying, awed. Willis turns, starts walking back to his chore. \nMATT 1?? 0`1 How's David doing up there in Castine? \nWILLIS Well he dunnit want to go overseas - oh no...he told them he'd Reep doinit as long as he could stay in Maine or Vermont- \nKATIE \n(INTER PTIN ) But David says if theyy want him to go out to New Mexico or California, he'll go back to infantry - he don't care.

FOWLER HOUSE - KITCHEN - DAY \nRuth is at the table, alone, dressed for rehearsal, hair done. She finishes her breakfast as she pours through the weekend's mail. Matt in a suit, steps in to say goodbye. \nMATT I'm going now. She looks up. \nRUTH \n(FLAT) Okay. \nMATT You ready to go back? \nRUTH \nMATT \n(T IN ) You loo nice. \nANGLE Who looks to Ruth for some kind of reaction. Nothing. Matt heads out the door. Ruth continues sorting the mail. She stops on one piece. Seems stunned, repeatedly reading it. \nTHE ENVELOPE It's from Publisher's Clearinghouse. In oversized block letters, it reads, \nFRANK FOWLER, YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY WON $10,000,000! She stares at the piece for a long time. Looks off. Smiles. And starts giggling. She can't stop. The giggles quickly flow into a deep laughing fit, harder and harder as the tears rain down. \nINT. MATT'S OFFICE - DAY \nMatt is in his office, on the phone. \nMATT \n(INTO PHONE Well that's totall unacceptable isn't it? - Well what did he say? uh huh well, we can't allow that m I guess we're gonna have to show him how the cow eats the cabbage.

There's someone ' Ryan Collit. His mother`N brought him in. He doesn't have an appointment but-- I'm sorry bL _; you'll have to re-schedule.

He gets up and grabs his jacket \nMATT Sorry Janelle, I'll be back at four. \nJANELLE \nRUTH (taking off the phones) Yes? There's a pause, then the door slowly opens. Natalie takes a step in. Ruth looks up. If she's surprised, she doesn't show it, \nNATALIE I - -a I hope this is okay. Ruth says nothing. Natalie moves closer. \nNATALIE I've been hoping we might be able to get together - to talk. Ruth watches her as she approaches the desk. Natalie bends and cautiously extends her hand for Ruth to hold. \nNATALIE I just want to tell you how -e- And in a flash Ruth SLAPS Natalie across the face with her open hand. Natalie springs back, paralyzed with shock. She tries to catch her breath, staring directly at Ruth. Eyes ablaze, Ruth says nothing. - The two women look at each other for a very long time And final , as if she finally somehow got the resolution she came for, lead held high, Natalie turns and walks out. \nE X T STROUT & SONS CANNERY T cyclone fence surrounds the lace. sign reads \"Strout \nSONS\"- it is the end of the day. \nA grow of workers file out, gabbing, starting to strip the eves of their smocks and hair-nets. Tim, Frank's friend, exits with his co-workers. He climbs into his mini pick-up, and pulls out of the lot. A few seconds later, from outside the lot, Matt's car pulls \nAWAY- \nINT. SHOW & TELL - AFTERNOON - LATER \nA crowded working class tavern. Video oker machines, beef jerky at the bar, Schaeffer's on tap. We're in fuck. it's happy-hour. Tim sits around a table with a couple of buddies, laughing. \nCHARLES We lost a few strings and we had a fair idea it was him who was doing it - so's I just flat out asked him \"No wasn't me.\" You should of seen what he tried to pull last wintah. He was up to the island there - and he claimed our traps were in his part of the cove - Bobb was up to the tavern on the head and e d him shooting his mouth off about how he and his stet an was gonna take a bat to the old man & me - so's I told the old man about it and he says \"Don't hurt my feelings none.\"He says \"Go on down to the Walmart and buy a couple of plastic bats.\" Next day the old man walks intah the office at the market - near the scales - where he know's the son of a bitch is gonna come in with his catch. He's got two six penny nails a hammer, and the bats o'coarse, so he nails those things right intah the wall. The guy at the scales looks at him like he's nuts \"Whatta ya doing there Ivan\" he says \"Just sending a message\" and the old man walks out. I come in and I could see what he wrote across them things. The door to the bar opens. \nTIM What? \nCHARLES \"Here's the bats - if you got the balls.\" Tim and the others crack up. \nCHARLES Didn't touch our traps aftah that. stops mid sentence. \nMatt is passing by his table. \nTIM Dr. Fowler? Matt flinches, \"surprised\" to see Tim. \nA FEW MINUTES LATER Matt and Tim have moved to another booth. Matt leans heavily on his elbows, listening to Tim. \nTIM No - no, I don't even see Richard anymore. And he'd never tell me anything, believe Me. Matt takes a pull of beer. \nMATT Sure, of course. I was just wondering, you know, maybe there was something you heard, through the grapevine, maybe one of his buddies said something --- \nTIM \n(SEARCHING MEMORY) No -a- \nMATT I was thinking, Richard's brothers, they're still working with you, right? They must talk. Tim throws a nervous look over to the table where his friends ea They're oblivious to the conversation. He looks back to Matt, shifting in his seat. Matt leans forward. He speaks in an intense whisper. \nMATT I'm just saying, Tim, if we could find something, something concrete. If you could just ... it could be just a slip of the tongue --- Tim looks into Matt's eyes, feeling the torment. \nTIM I'll keep my ears open. Matt looks at him, dissatisfied. \nTIM It's funny running into you here, Dr. Fowler. Matt looks at Tim blankly, then finishes his beer. \nIN/EXT. TT\u00b0S CAR - AFTERNOON - LATER \nMatt drives end of highway. \nNEXT LIGHT Matt pulls into the left-hand turn lane and signals. There is a car in front of h\u00b0 Above the licence plate is a yellow sticker which reads \"Student Driver-\" The plate itself is a vanity plate it says P Y4US- A 73 BLUE PICK- truck eases to a stop in the right lane, next to Matt's car. Matt glances over, for a moment he half expects to see Frank. He cracks the passenger side window, for a better look. He stares at the driver's window. Their window rolls down. attractive girl with short brunette hair stares back at Matt. Lost in the absurdity, he doesn't look away. The light changes. The girl smiles sweetly and blows him a kiss, before continuing through the light. Matt watches her go - he smiles - as if somehow relieved. The car behind him gives a polite toot - Matt makes the left. \n- SOUTH END MARKET - S Ruth enters, passing the empty front register. She strolls down an aisle, pulling some items from the shelves. TWO N CHAT from the next aisle. \nE #1 0-S- yeah, man, I - d better get back to the grind --- \nMALE #2 O.S. Alright, pal --- \nE #1 0-S- Just don't ste al anything. NIC, 301S, wearing a clerk-s apron, price gun, and plastic tag tha: says IC, rounds the end of the aisle. As he does, he spots - \nRUTH, moving down the aisle toward him. He freezes A nervous smile - He throws a quick look to the other aisle. \nRUTH No, I don't know, Matt. I don't know what you go through, or if you go through ything. But that's your choice, dear, not mine... \nMATT You're goddamn right it is. My choice is to not scream at the world. Maybe one of us has to be reasonable here, did you ever think of that? \nRUTH Reasonable? e, Matt, I don' t know about you, but I ss my son. I'm glad you have time for reason. That's what you imparted to Frank, That sense of reason - Oh, he thought you were very reasonable. \nMATT What the hell is that supposed to mean? She is about to say something, but stops short. \nRUTH Nothing. She turns back to the dishes. He moves in on her, seething. \nMATT What are you really trying to say anyway? She says nothing, picking up the broken plates. \nTT .that I'm the one responsible? She drops the pieces back in the sink and exits. \nTHE HALL He's fast on her heels. She heads for the bedroom. \nMATT Let me tell you something. Let me tell you something! She throws the door closed behind her, but he bangs it open with his palm. \nMATT You of it backwards. I know what you think. That I was too lenient, that I let him get away with ... \nRUTH Everything. Everything! She exits into \nTHE He's right behind her. \nMATT Oh, really?!? Why do you think he never came to you? \nRUTH He wouldn't talk to me, Matt. He didn't trust me. You made sure of that. \nLIVING ROOM. \nMATT Why would he talk to you, Ruth? You never listened! \nRUTH No. But you did. You were winking at him the whole time. You encouraged him. You wanted what he had. Her. \nMATT You've got to be kidding... \nRUTH You know it. Come on. You wanted it, and you couldn't get it - that's why you didn't stop him so you could get your kicks through your son. You know that's what happened. And now you can't cope with it. You can't admit the truth - To me, or to yourself - You can't admit that he died for ygur fantasy piece of ass. Matt, stunned, reels for a second And then, finally, explodes. \nTT You want to know why our son is dead, Ruth? He wasn't with her because of me, he went there because of you. Because you were so controllins, so overbearing, so angry that he was it, that he was our only one. \nRUTH That is not true. \nMATT It is! From the time he was little you were telling him why he was wrong. Everything he did was wrong. What was wrong with him, Ruth? She stares at him, dumbfounded. \nMATT You are so unfor ivinge You are. That's what he said. Ana you're playing the same shit out with me - That's a horrible way to be! Horrible. You're bitter, Ruth. You can point your finger at me all you want \nMATT .but you better take a good look at yourself first. She already has, of course. \nRUTH \n(WE ) I just wanted to talk about what happened, Matt. \nMATT You expect me just to open up to you? Embrace you? You scare me. How can I talk to you? I can't even look at you. They suddenly become aware of the DOORBELL, ringing, over and over. They watch each other, both reeling, both out of breath. The DOORBELL continues. \nMATT \n(COMPLETELY DRAINED) That's probably ... the police. \nTHE DOOR Matt opens it. There is no cop, just Kristen Gellar, 12, a young gymnast who'd like to compete in Hawaii. \nKRISTEN \n(REHEARSED) Hi there. I'm Kristen Gellar from the Rockland Gymnastics Association - Today we're selling brand name candy. Each purchase is matched by the Tandy corporation to help us meet our goal of travelling to Oahu to compete in the East/West conference. Matt's in another world. He stares at her. \nMATT I... ...sure. I'll take some. \n(ENJOYING THIS) That's what I said five card draw - jacks to open - Carl? \nHENRY Asshole, Matt smiles. He's missed these guys. \nCARL I'll open with a dollar. \nHENRY Raise a buck. The bet's to Matt. He stares at his cards for a very long time. Willis looks to say something, when Henry hits his arm. This stops him. Matt looks up. He sees the patience they are all exercising for his typical indecisiveness. This bothers him. He stares back down at his cards. Stalling, waiting for someone to bust him. He looks u at Willis - Henry - Carl. They all sort of smile uncomfortably. He can't take it. \nTT Oh, for Christ sake say something! This wakes them up. \nMATT Quit pussy footing around me d 't! You just gonna let me stare at these cards all night!? No one wants to make the first move. This upsets Matt even more. \nMATT O.K. fine! He stares back down at his cards. Finally it is Carl who speaks. There are things of which I may not speak; There are dreams that cannot die; There are thoughts that make the strong heart weak, And bring a pallor into the cheek, And a mist before the eye. And the words of that fatal song come over me like a chill: A boy's will is the wind's will, And the thoughts of youth are long, long thoughts. Matt looks up from his cards into Carl's eyes. The two men regard each other. \nEXT. GRINNEL HOUSE - FRONT PORCH - NIGHT \nThe game has ended. Matt says goodnight to Henry and Carl, as the two of them pull out of Willis Is driveway. Matt is about to leave. Just climbing in the front seat. When Willis puts a hand on his shoulder. \nWILLIS Come back in for a drink. \nI NT. GRINNEL HOUSE- ENTRY HALL - NIGHT Willis and Matt step back in, closing the door behind them. \nKATIE O.S. Honey, are you coming to bed now? Willis moves to the steps leading upstairs. \nWILLIS Soon baby, Matt's still here. \nKATIE 0.S. 11 %-?.: Oh f hi Matt - Hone , would you mind bringing me my pit s? They're downstairs from when the kids were here. \nWILLIS I'll be right there. \nI NT. GRINNEL HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT A few minutes later. Matt sits alone in the room. Be gets up to examine a picture hanging on the opposite wall. He's not particularly interested, he's seen it a million times, he's just killing time. A corner of the room devoted to Naval memories. A pristine version of Matt's U.S.S. CONSTELLATION cap serves as the center piece. Willis comes down from upstairs. \nWILLIS She's all set - now what can I get you? \nMATT I'm fine thanks. Willis nods and takes a seat. \nWILLIS - you back on the wagon? He is. \nWILLIS Sit down Matt you're making me nervous. Matt takes a seat. \nWILLIS I'm glad you came tonight. \nMATT Me too. \nWILLIS Boy, Carl really laid on the verse huh? \nMATT \n(CHUCKLING) ye ..ye he did. Got me thinking \nOUT- e stops himself. \nWILLIS What? \nMATT I don't know - sort of silly really. \nWILLIS C'mon what is it? \nMATT This thing with - with Frank when he was about three, I guess. We were over at my folkls house. \nMATT Mom always liked little dogs - this one was a - Pekingese, I think. I remember hearing this yelp, and then a scream. Frank ran out pointing to his finger. I looked at it couldn't see an thino. Mom said Frank must have \"cornered the dog\" and I knew she was probably right. We were driving home, and Ruth noticed Frank itching his a ..she pulled back his sleeve, and there were these two deep, bloody, puncture marks... \nWILLIS Why do you think he pointed to his finger? Matt shakes his head. \nTT \nWAITRESS No, thanks. Maybe some other night. He stands in front of his Brown Suburban, watching as the Waitress gets in her car, pulls away and leaves. \nRICHARD Fuckin' bitch. He turns and freezes. Matt Fowler stands a few feet away, an Ortaies calibre 7.65 automatic directly at Richard's face. His gloved hand poin grips the gun tightly. \nRICHARD Dr. Fowler? \nMATT Don't talk. Unlock it and get in. \nRIC He . wait a minute. Let's, let's just calm down... Matt COCKS the gun. \nRIC Alright! Shit. Richard obeys. He unlocks both doors. Matt opens the back door, but stays planted, the gun trained on Richard. Richard gets in the driver's seat. Matt climbs in the back. He presses the gun's muzzle against the back of Richard's head. \nV 0-, \nMATT Is there any one at your place? \nRIC \n(IRONICALLY) \nNOT TONIGHT \nMATT Good. Drive there. Richard looks over his shoulder to back the car up. Matt aims at his temple, but does not look at his eyes. Richard finishes backing up and puts it into drive. \nMATT Drive slowly - don't try to get stopped. \nEXT. PETER'S PARKING LOT ALLEY \nMatt can see the ocean. He uncocks the revolver. Matt cracks the window. Matt leans down in his seat. He transfers the gun into his left hand, removes the glove from his right, and wipes the sweat from his bare palm onto his pantleg. He puts the glove back on, gripping the gun. Richard's Brown Suburban drives down an alley adjacent to Fun Park and turns onto a deserted Main Street. \nINT/EXT. BROWN SUBURBAN - NIGHT \nThey drive back through town, the sea wall on their left hiding the beach. on the right are the places, most with their neon signs off, that do so much business in s er: the lounges and cafes and pizza houses. The street itself empty of traffic. \nRICHARD He was making it with my wife. His voice is careful, not pleading. Matt presses hard with the muzzle against Richard's head. Richard flinches and moves his head forward. Matt lowers the gun to his lap. \nMATT Don-t talk. \n/EXT. BROWN SUBURBAN RICHARD S TROUT'S DUPLEX - NIGHT \nThe Brown Suburban slowly pulls up to the front. Matt leans forward. Th. muzzle grazing Richard's head. Drive it to the back. \nRIC You wouldn't have it cocked, would you? For when I put on the brakes. Matt COCKS it. It is now. Richard tenses. He drives around the side of the building. \nEXT. RICHARD STROUT'S DUPLEX BACK YARD - NIGHT \nThe Brown Suburban inches forward toward the garage and brakes. The engine shuts off. Matt keeps the cocked gun firmly trained on Richard. He gets out and shuts the door with his hip. \nMATT All right. Richard looks at the gun, then gets out. He moves across the grass. Matt closely behind, looking at the row of small backyards on either side of them and scattered tall trees. He glances from house to house. Looking for signs of one insomniac neighbor, some man or woman sitting alone watching the all-night channel from Boston. All is quiet. They move up the back walk and to the side kitchen door. Matt stands directly behind Richard as he opens the door. It-s pitch black inside the duplex. \nMATT Turn on the light. Richard flips the wall switch. in the light. Matt stares at his wide back, and long reach. \nI NT. RICHARD S TROUT'S DUPLEX - KITCHEN NIGHT Richard stops just inside the kitchen. Matt closes the door softly behind gim. \nMATT Where-s you r suitcase? Richard almost turns around. \nRIC My suitcase? \nMatt grips the gun tighter, straining to keep it from ling. \nMATT Where is it? \nRIC in the bedroom closet. \nMATT That's where were going then. When we get to a door you stop and turn on the light. They cross the kitchen. Matt can't help but glance at the sink and stove and refrigerator: no dishes in the sink or even the dish rack beside it, no grease splashings on the stove, the refrigerator clean and white. Matt becomes momentarily 2reoccupied with one of Duncan's drawings taped to its door. \nMATT I didn't use your name. \nRIC They'll figure that out too. You think I wouldn't have done it myself if it was that easy? Silence. He starts it up, slides into reverse. He looks back over his shoulder as they back down the driveway. Matt averts his stare. Looking down at the gun barrel but not at the profiled face beyond it. \nMATT You were alone. We've got it worked out. \nRIC .who's we? Good estion. Matt doesn't answer though. Richard shifts into drive. \nEXT. RICHARD'S CONDO - PARKING LOT - S \nThe Brown Suburban pulls out of the lot and onto the street. \nI NT. BROWN SUBURBAN - S \nRIC There's no planes this time of night, Dr. Fowler. \nMATT back through town. Then north on 73. \nRIC The airport's South... \nMATT Somebody's going to keep you for a while. They'll take you to the airport - turn on the radio. Find the game. \nRIC It's after three \nMATT They run it again. Matt leans back, quietly uncorking the hammer. \nMATT No more talking. Richard tries to read Matt \u00b0s face in the mirror, but it -s now in shadows. Richard fumbles with the radio, surfing the stations. Matt is right. The game is on. Nomar Garcia arra hits a long drive to left with runners in scoring position \"A cinch to collect 200 hits this season.\" Richard sets his eyes on the road. \nEXT. BROWN SUBURBAN - HIGHWAY 1 SOUTH - NIGHT \nThe Brown Suburban heads away from Old orchard, onto a small two lane rural hi hwayy. The road is flanked on both sides by open fields, and lonely capes. Few cars on the road. \nINT BROWN SUB /WISSC SET BRIDGE They come up over the high bride over the channel: to the left the smacking curling white at the breakwater and beyond that the dark sea and a full moon, and down to the right the small fishing boats bobbing at anchor in the cove. Swirling colors from behind catch their attention. Richard and Matt both look in the rear-view. A state trooper's car with its gumballs flashing races up in the distance behind them. Matt jams the gun into Richard's ribs and slouches down. \nMATT (Trying to stay ca ri ht take it easy - pull over to the shoo der. Matt & Richard sit tight waiting for the inevitable. The light gains in intensity, as the cab fills with crimson. \nEXT. WISCASSET BRIDGE \nThe cruiser tears right past them. Quickly fading into the distance. ? e \nI NT.

KICKING \nONE LEG BEHIND HIM, PUSHING HIMSELF FORWARD, TOWARD THE WOODS. \nMATT WATCHES DISPASSIONATELY. \nSTEPS FORWARD, RAISES THE GUN AND FIRES ONE MORE SHOT. \nRICHARD STOPS MOVING. Matt stands there motionless. We hear FOOTSTEPS. Willis runs up to Matt. \nSTOPS AT RICHARD'S CORPSE. \nWILLIS \n(BREATHLESS) \nMATT The two men look into each others eyes. Matt seems to be somewhe re else He looks back down at the body. \nWILLIS This isn't what we talked out, \nMATT He tried to run. Willis looks at the gun still in Matt's hand, the little suitcase in the other. \nWILLIS We were going to wait, and take him out in the woods. Matt raises his head. He looks at Willis flatly. \nMATT I coul \u00b0t wait. \nBODY - a d in a BLUE TARP, is suddenly dragged away by the ATV. It es quite a racket. We follow it as it scrapes along, the road back into the woods \nWOODS - They have roved the body from the ATV and are now draggin it deep into the wood. The only sound is the breaking of brans es and their continual grunting. The stop\u00b0at the top of a small knoll, panting and sweating. Wil is quietly removes a small mass of branches, revealing a o t large, well-dug hole. Together, they drag the body t he edge of the hole. Move behind it. Lift the legs, and push it in. \nTHE WOODS - LATER - Willis and Matt come up from the woods. They carry Richard's lug age. Willis drops the canvas bags into the hole. Matt loo s at the suitcase and then drops it in. Willis takes a couple of steps away, and grabs two shovels leaning against a small birch. He hands one to Matt. Together, they begin filling in the hole. \nSAME PLACE - LATER - Matt holds the flashlight as Willis sprinkles leaves and branches over the hole. Willis freezes, as if he has heard something. Matt cuts the light. They hear some footsteps approaching, closer, then they see it - \nA DEER not 30 yards distant watchin them A Buck with a splendid rack, a deep chestsnowy white, a l of him in his prime His flag up d twitching. His eyes u Quin Then he bounds off and is gone. \nWOODS LATER - The walk through the woods. The light on the ground. They bot look up through the trees where they end at the lake. Neither of them speak, only the sounds of their hea breathing and clumsy strides through the low brush and over fa len branches. \nEXT. BOW \nWide and dark, lap ing softly at the bank, a small island near it's middle, with black, tall evergreens.

Given the schedule considerations on this docket, the court feels that we should conduct the probable cause hearing in tandem. Witnesses will be called at this time. Unless there are any objections to the contrary this court will recess until 2:00 p.m. \nEXT. KNOX COUNTY COURTHOUSE - DAY \nNatalie comes up the brick walk and enters the building. \nINT. OX COUNTY COURTHOUSE LATER \nA gray concrete room, washed out by the buzzing overhead florescent. Matt and Ruth sit on metal fold-out chairs, alongside twenty or so spectators, and a smattering of reporters, in the gallery. Richard unkempt and dressed in an ORANGE JUMPSUIT, sits patientiy next to one of his two attorneys. Matt and Ruth glance over at NATHAN STROUT, 62, sitting directly behind Richard. Nathan's two other sons, both big men like Richard, sit at his side. Nathan feels the Fowlers, stares. His eyes stay focused on the front of the room. Richard's trial attorney, MARLA S, 301s, smart, expensive, and a long way from her home in Boston, stands in the COURT WELL. Natalie Strout in the witness box. So, Mr. Fowler had asked you to go upstairs with your chil, ?z s your husband was trying to enter...

There's no reason to waste anymore of the court's time . - . \nKEYES Your Honor, we just want to review exactly what s. Strout saw on the afternoon of July 17th. Isn't that why we're here? The Judge nods. \nJUDGE overruled. \n(TO NATALIE) Please continue. Natalie tries to recapture her place. Keyes nods. \nMARLA KEYES \n(RECAPPING) So you were bringing your children up to their bedroom ... Natalie's glance wanders to the gallery, to Matt and Ruth. She,sits on her hands to keep them from shaking. \nNATALIE 0 Right. I was in Jason and Dunk's room I didn't know what was happening downstairs. I was getting worried. I asked Jason to read Dunk a story. He didn't want a story - He wanted to come with me ... so I sat him back down on the bunk and I left them in the room. \nKEYES You left \"them\"? \nNATALIE My boys. She starts to cry. \nKEYES \n(SOFTLY) Of course - I'm sorry. on. \nNATALIE I closed the door...I moved down the hall. I looked back to make sure they weren't behind me.

DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY Davis hands a cup of coffee to Matt, who sits on a faux leather couch with Ruth. \nDAVIS (to Ruth re: coffee) You sure you don't want? \nRUTH I'm fine. Davis takes a seat across from them. \nDAVIS You see, we can't appeal bail - It's just not set up that way. RUTH - -y You let that bastard walk out and we're supposed to just sit here? Don't tell us there's nothing to do about this. \nDAVIS It's not us, s. Fowler. The state's bail code is to ensure future court appearances \nDAVIS In this case Strout's family was prepared to put up a substantial amount of property as bail - That, along with his ties to the community made it hard for us to convince the judge of a serious \"Risk of Flight\". \nRUTH Oh - I see. \nDAVIS It's not just your case. Now you can file a civil suit. I recommend it. But not now, wait till after the crimminal trial. Matt stares at a small cartoonish statue on Davis's desk. It is one of those things that were popular in the 70's. A little man chasing an ambulance. It reads \"World's Greatest Lawyer.\" \nRUTH And when will that be? Next week, next month? \nDAVIS Well... honestly - anywhere between twelve and eighteen months? \nRUTH I thought you said there would be a jury trial sometime in October!? \nDAVIS If he was incarcerated the udge would move for an October date - basically to save the County the cost of housing and feeding him as an inmate - But with bail the court date, unfortunately, is always later. \n", "test3_true": "MATT But you're confident you'll be able to put him away for good then... Right? Davis looks uncomfortable with the question. Ruth sees this. She gathers herself. \nRUTH EJ The things she said in there ...what is the damage? \nDAVIS Manslaughter. \nRUTH DAVIS What? Oh, Jesus Christ! The wav this is going, that'd be my bet - especially since Nathan Strout brought up that barracuda from Boston - she's very smart. \nRUTH This was no accident. Be killed our son in cold blood. Ruth. \nRUTH What? \nMATT How long would he be sent away for? \nDAVIS Hard to say really. Anywhere between five to fifteen years. We think we have a good shot at the max - fifteen. Even with good behavior, he'd do a full ten. \nRUTH Ten years? Five years? Are you out of your mind!? He killed my son. Does anyone know this? Matt looks at his shoes, as Ruth glares down Davis. Davis sits back, a little shook up. \nDAVIS I'm sorry, s. Fowler. I understand. Unfortunately, in situations like this when there is no eye witness, there ... well, there's not a lot we can do. \nINT. MATT'S CAR - DAY - MOVING \nMatt drives. Ruth looks out the windshield.

Pen and pencil marks straight lines each about two inches apart - each with Frank's name and aqe. \nT DEN Matt sits in his chair. The plays, muted. He \u00b0s looks at it, but he's not watching.

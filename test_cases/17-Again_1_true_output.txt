Mike tries to squeeze out. The Bras block him. The music changes...a remix version of Hammer's `Can't Touch This' blares. 
MIKE I thought you girls wanted to dance? 
Mike breaks into the 80's Hammer routine WE saw from the first scene. 
The Bras back up. Party-Goers stop what they're doing and watch...not sure whether to laugh or join in. 
And then, the Bras fall in.      Followed by others.   The party just got hotter. 
Maggie runs through the party and out the back. Stan chases after her. Mike inconspicuously Hammer walks his way out of the mix and outside. 
EXT. ED'S HOUSE/POOL - NIGHT 
Stan corners Maggie against the back wall. 
STAN I was upset. I'm sorry. But I need you to show me you love me. Then we'll move in together. 
MAGGIE Whatever.    I'm with someone else now. 
STAN Yeah, right. Who'd be stupid enough? 
MAGGIE Him. 
Stan turns angrily toward Mike as he approaches. 
MIKE Party's over, Stan.      You're out of here. 
STAN Who's gonna make me leave?      You? 
MIKE I would but it smells like you've been drinking so I'll let the cops do it. 
Mike pulls out his phone.      Stan looks to Maggie then back to Mike, laughs- 
STAN You can have the nun.      She doesn't put out anyway. 
MIKE On second thought- 
Mike SWINGS. Stan ducks, throws a giant uppercut. POW. Mike's eyes roll back in his head and WE cut to BLACK. 
INT. UPSCALE RESTAURANT/DINING ROOM - NIGHT 
The HOSTESS shows Ed and Julie to their table by the window. Ed wears his new Gucci outfit. Julie's under dressed. 
HOSTESS There you are, Mr. Freedman. 
ED Thanks. Put this towards your studies. 
Ed hands the Hostess a 50.   Julie rolls her eyes. 
JULIE When you asked me to get together to talk about Mark this isn't what I envisioned. This isn't a date, Ed. 
ED Are you insinuating that I'd use my son's misfortune just to go out with you? What kind of a father do you think I am? 
JULIE As long as we're on the same page. 
A WAITER approaches. 
WAITER Good evening. Would you care to see the wine- 
ED Bring us the 1962 Petrus. 
The Waiter nods, leaves. 
ED (CONT'D) You're going to love this wine. $2000 dollars a bottle. 
JULIE I don't drink. So tell me what you think's going on with Mark? 
ED It's baffling really but I noticed he's been drinking a lot of diet ice tea lately. Maybe he's gay? 
JULIE You didn't ask me here to talk about Mark, did you? 
ED Do you like caviar? Because if you do you have to try the Almas. 100 year-old Beluga. $700 per ounce. 
Julie throws her napkin on the table.

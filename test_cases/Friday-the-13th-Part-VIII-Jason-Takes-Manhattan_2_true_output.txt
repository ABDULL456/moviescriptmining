lets out a broad smile, her eyelids fluttering. They stay open long enough to regard the visitor in the doorway. She tries to choke out a warning to Jim, who's just collapsed himself. 
SUZY JJJJJJJJason... 
He doesn't follow her glance, smiling instead. 
JIM Uh-huh. You must really think I'm an ass. 
But she continues to stare in horror as: 
JASON 
raises the spear, taking aim. 
ANGLE - SUZY AND JIM 
Hs starts to kiss her but she bolts up with a blood- curdling SCREAM. A second later, JASON FIRES THE SPEAR, PIERCING HER NECK, PINNING HER TO THE HEAD BOARD. 
Jim stares point-blank at his dead girlfriend, not able to assimilate it quickly enough. He spins around to see the monster himself. 
JIM Ohmygod... 
Jim springs off the bed, looking around for anything to defend himself with, grabbing the bedside lamp. He SMASHES IT OVER JASON'S HEAD which has little effect. Jim scrambles to get past him, but Jason LIFTS JIM IN THE AIR, SLAMMING HIM DOWN ON ONE OF THE SPIKED BEDPOSTS. 
EXT. CRYSTAL LAKE - NIGHT 
as the HOUSEBOAT silently drifts onward. The lone silhouette of Jason emerges from within, taking the helm. He's back. 
FADE OUT/MAIN CREDITS. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. HARBOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
Only the faintest sign of daylight can be seen through a thick blanket of gray fog. In the distance, speckled lights outlining a smaller LUXURY CRUISE SHIP intermittently appear. 
EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY 
Standing at the boarding ramp is CHARLES MCCULLOCH, clipboard in hand. He's just finished checking off a pair of new-agey SENIOR GIRLS. McCulloch is approaching fifty, wearing a tie and unwrinkled clothes, as well as the disposition of a stern puritan. 
MCCULLOCH Remember girls, the shuffleboard tournament will start at six p.m. sharp. A non-attendance will restrict your time in port, understood? 
They nod for his benefit, exchanging derogatory whispers as they head up the ramp. Camera ADJUSTS to find a small parking lot adjacent to the docks, where several cars are just now arriving -- parents dropping off their high school seniors, hugging them bon voyage. 
CLOSER ANGLE PARKING LOT 
as SEAN ROBERTSON walks toward the ship with pal MILES WOLFE. Sean's a tall, nice looking, somewhat serious guy; Miles is shorter, athletic and more extroverted. 
MILES You're telling me this boat has a pool with a three meter board? 
SEAN It's a ship and that's right. Plus a disco, gym, game room and a lot more. 
MILES I think I'm gonna blow off New York and just stay on this thing. 
MCCULLOCH You'll do no such thing, Mr. Wolfe... 
Camera ADJUSTS to reveal McCulloch, holding his list, checking off their names. 
MCCULLOCH Your itinerary has been carefully planned and make no mistake, it will be executed accordingly. 
MILES (under his breath) Of course...wouldn't want to risk enjoying this trip. 
McCulloch gives him a frown. Sean steps up to him tentatively. 
SEAN Which cabin is Rennie in, Mr. McCulloch? 
MCCULLOCH Rennie's not coming. 
He's devastated. 
SEAN But I thought... 
MCCULLOCH She changed her mind. (eyeing list) Let's see...Mr. Wolfe is in stateroom one-eleven and you, Mr. Robertson, are in two-twenty-five. 
A booming VOICE from above interrupts them: 
ADMIRAL ROBERTSON (O.S.) Sean -- where the hell have you been? We're already into early departure protocol... 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
Standing on the upper deck is a no-nonsense, uniformed Navy man, ADMIRAL ROBERTSON. The captain of the ship. And Sean's father. Sean's sadness about Rennie's absence is immediately replaced with anxiety. 
SEAN Be right up, Dad. 
He and Miles head up the gangway, both boys giving McCulloch one last glare. 
INT. '76 BMW 2002 - DAY 
Behind the wheel is MISS COLLEEN VAN DEUSEN, thirties, attractive, a progressive attitude. RENNIE WICKHAM sits next to her -- she's seventeen, pretty, slightly withdrawn. Rennie's dog TOBY, a border collie, rides in the back seat. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN I'm glad you decided to come after all. 
RENNIE Me too. But I'm not sure Uncle Charles will be. 
MISS VAN DEUSEN You let me worry about him, okay? (pause) Personal experiences are what fuel the minds of great writers, Rennie. You made the right decision.

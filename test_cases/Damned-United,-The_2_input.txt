BREMNER No, he's not. 
BREMNER, GILES AND HUNTER turn. Walks back towards the bus. 
BREMNER (cont'd) More's the fucking pity. 
CUT TO: 
58   INT. REVIE'S OFFICE - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1969)              58 
DON REVIE's face: he watches through a window in Elland Road, as.... 
59   EXT. CAR PARK - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1969)                   59 
The Derby Coach arrives. Hydraulic brakes HISSSSSSS. Doors open. Boots, shoes, walk down steps. 
BRIAN CLOUGH, PETER TAYLOR and the Derby Army disembark. CLOUGH's face: as he looks up at the writing on the side of the stadium. LEEDS UNITED F.C. 
60   INT. DRESSING-ROOM - ELLAND ROAD - DAY - (1969)              60 
Some PLAYERS getting dressed. CLOUGH, TAYLOR and JIMMY GORDON massaging others. Shin-pads. Water-bottles. 
CLOUGH Right, last time there was a whole division between you and Leeds. Not now. Not today. Today we're here as Second Division champions, and equals with Leeds. John McGovern and Billy Bremner, EQUALS. Kevin Hector and Johnny Giles, EQUALS. Alan Hinton and Peter Lorimer, John O'Hare and Paul Madely. EQUALS. Now, c'mon, chins up. Chests out. We can take this fucking lot. 
The PLAYERS clatter out, studs rattling down the tunnel, into the roar of the CROWD.. 
CAPTION: LEEDS 5 - DERBY 0 
61   INT. HOTEL/PUB - DERBY - NIGHT - (1969)                      61 CLOUGH and TAYLOR in a deserted bar. Alone. A television plays in the corner. DON REVIE's face on TV... 
DON REVIE (ON TV) ...obviously it's a terrific achievement for Derby, being promoted to the First Division, but the truth is Leeds United have an unfortunate habit of reminding them just how far they still have to go.. 
TAYLOR Arrogant twat.. 
CLOUGH But he's right. Five nothing. They made us look like fools today. And what was John O'Hare doing? Letting Madeley bully him like that. (MO RE)                         (CO NTINU ED) 
61   CON TINUE D:                                                 61 CLO UGH (cont'd) Push him around. Madeley's half his bloody size. O'Hare needs to toughen up. He's from Scottish dockyards, isn't he? And what about John McGovern? He was useless in the middle. Who's idea was that? 
TAYLOR Yours. 
CLOUGH He was all over the place. Like the Wandering Jew. Giving the ball to anyone BUT his own. We need a ball player, a natural in midfield. Who'll hold onto it. Keep possession. We're giving it away too easily. 
TAYLOR Someone like Colin Todd. CLOUGH (sharp intake) Oooh, now you're talking. Lovely pair of feet. 
TAYLOR I've heard he wants out of Sunderland, too. They're all jumping ship up there. 
CLOUGH thinks for a moment, then... 
CLOUGH Well, go on then. Sign him. TAYLOR What? We can't. Longson's already told us. Club's in debt. 
CLOUGH Bollocks to that. I've not brought us all the way to the First Division just to sit there mid-table, and be cannon fodder for sides like Leeds. Sign the man. 
TAYLOR Hang on, hang on, careful... 
CLOUGH I'll handle bloody Longson. 
62   EXT. TRAINING GROUND - DERBY - DAY - (1972)                  62 
CLOUGH is working a session with the Derby PLAYERS. A car screeches into the car park behind. A red-faced, apoplectic SAM LONGSON gets out.. 
UNCLE SAM A hundred and seventy grand?!? For Colin fucking Todd?!? 
CLOUGH Correction, the ALMIGHTY Colin Todd. The best technical footballer in the country. 
UNCLE SAM A salary of three hundred quid a week? You can't pay a footballer that!! 
CLOUGH That's the way things are going, Uncle Sam. Football's all about money now. 
UNCLE SAM I told you never to go over my head again. 
CLOUGH Had no choice. Windows opened up. You were in the bloody West Indies. 
UNCLE SAM WindowS? You mean there were others?!? 
CLOUGH Messrs. Gemmell and Hennessy. 
Two PLAYERS turn and wave to LONGSON..

A nearby soldier ant take a firefly out of his knapsack and pinches him.  The firefly, yelling "Yipe!  Yipe!  Yipe!", shoots into the air like a flare, lighting up the interior of the stump with eery, shifting luminescence. 
Then we notice, hollowed into the inside of the stump like innumerable pockmarks, termite holes staring out upon the stump...and, with an unearthly ROAR, we see the first of hundreds of termites emerging to pour into the center of the tree, right onto the ant army. 
COLONEL They're here!!! 
BARBATUS (to Z) Keep your head down! 
Within moments, Z finds himself in the middle of a BLOODBATH.  The ants have broken into the colony, but are taking heavy losses from the gigantic, blind, acid-spewing termites.  The battle scene is as sprawling and chaotic as something out of Braveheart. In a few QUICK SHOTS from Z's perspective, we see: 
-- A squad of ants rushes towards a termite soldier, but are literally melted into smoking heaps of flesh by a jet of acid from its forehead... 
-- A termite warrior is overwhelmed by a crowd of ants and is pulled to pieces with hideous ripping sounds... 
-- Another termite warrior takes on an ant soldier one on one and slowly crushes his head in his huge jaws... 
Z (looking around) Guys!  Guys!  It isn't too late for all of us to just talk this over! 
Just then, a termite burst up from the ground and turns to face Z.  Z is dwarfed by this hulking, roaring, drooling monstrosity. 
Z Wait!  Please!  Acid makes me come out in spots!  -- Could I just say I have always had the greatest respect for your species?  I mean, eating wood -- why didn't I think of that? I -- 
The termite rears, getting ready to melt Z, when OOF! he's knocked backwards by... 
Z BARBATUS!  You -- you saved my life! 
BARBATUS Don't get all sappy about it! 
As Barbatus and some other soldiers kill the termite, the Colonel strides up to Z, puffing on a cigar. 
COLONEL I love the smell of formic acid in the morning. 
Z Look out! 
A stream of termite acid engulfs the colonel, instantly burning him to a cinder clutching a still-burning cigar; Z's paratroop buddies turn in terror to see a herd of termites rumbling towards them.  Z, terrified, dives into the hole that the huge termite made... 
INT. TERMITE TUNNEL - NIGHT 
...and tumbles headlong into a corridor of the termite mound. The corridors here are primitive, caveman-like, pocked with jagged access holes. 
No sooner has Z landed in the tunnel than a termite comes burrowing out from one of the side walls, snapping at Z's head.  Z just avoids getting decapitated, and digs straight through the wall in order to escape... 
INT. TERMITE QUEEN'S CHAMBER - NIGHT 
...straight into the hub of the entire termite complex -- the Queen's chamber.  This is nothing like the civilized court of the ant colony -- it's a huge, stinking, fetid dungeon whose walls are held up by one massive (to Z) column of piled stones. 
The termite queen, a repulsive, slimy, squirming, foot-long monster, is attended by a crew of diminutive, blind termite nurses.  The queen turns to look Z right in the eye. 
Z Excuse me.  I seem to be lost, and I was wondering if you could give me -- 
Before Z can say, "directions", the queen gives out a piercing, blood-curdling shriek.  The nurses start shrieking too. 
Z (backing away) I'll let myself out. 
But the queen's shriek has summoned a soldier termite -- the biggest one we've seen yet -- who is charging headlong at Z, jaws snapping open and shut like huge scissors.

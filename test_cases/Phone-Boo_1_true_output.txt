VOICE I never talk to people I can't see. I need to study their reactions. 
STU Alright, bullshit artist, what am I doing right now? 
VOICE Scratching your forehead with your left hand.  Now you're brushing your hair back. 
STU Okay, okay, you got me in your scrutiny.  So what? 
VOICE So let's talk. 
STU Only I got nothing to say. 
VOICE Oh, you will.  You'll do a lot of talking before this conversation is over.  And it'll only end when I want it to. 
STU Is that a fact?  Well if you watch closely, you will see me hang up. 
VOICE I don't think you will. 
STU Why not? 
VOICE I interest you. 
STU Why should I be interested in some creep who gets his jollies spying on strangers in phone booths? 
VOICE But you're not a stranger, Stu. 
The sound of his own name sends a chill through him. 
STU Who put you up to this? 
VOICE You were my very own selection. 
STU Why me in particular? 
VOICE Because you're so afraid. 
STU Ha!  What've I got to be afraid of? 
STU Just about everything.  You have so much to hide. 
STU How do you figure that? 
VOICE Why else would a man with a perfectly good cellular bother to make calls from a pay booth? 
STU That's my business. 
VOICE I've made it mine. 
STU All of a sudden I'm required to give explanations to you? 
VOICE In explicit detail. 
STU What is this?  Some kind of candid camera gag?  Or like that thing on HBO where the cab driver is taping what goes on in the back seat? 
VOICE This is not showbusiness, my friend.  This is reality. 
STU Your reality.  Not mine, you lowlife fuck. 
VOICE Stu, you'll be made to suffer for your attitude, so let's dispense with the vulgarities. 
STU Now you're threatening me!  Fuck you.  Could that be any clearer?

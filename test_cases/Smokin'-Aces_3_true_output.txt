SIR IVY All that slight a'hand you can do and you still ain't never learned to lie right-- 
--Israel steps hard, slinging the Ace sidearm, sailing it toward Ivy, surgical strike, right eye, blood bursting at his browline-- Ivy goes down in a heap. 
SIR IVY (CONT'D) (enraged) MOTHERFUCK! MOTHERFUCKER! 
Ivy, doubled over-- he drags the .50 cal from its holster and lets fly-- FIRING. Big bore rounds rip right through the wall, punching dinner-plate sized holes in the plaster. Israel goes to the ground as Ivy, bleeding, blazes away-- 
INT. PENTHOUSE SUITE -- ANTEROOM -- SAME 
--Soot takes cover as bullets whistle by-- he tucks the 9mm away just as the doors to the suite are blitzed and the security team stumbles in, guns drawn, grouped tight-- 
SECURITY TEAM (in unison) DOWN! DOWN! DOWN! 
They assume quasi-combat stances; six idiots, crab-crawling their way across the room. Soot stays prone, plays scared, realizes that his rubber appliance nose has come loose, tries to adjust it-- can't, has to hide his face, burying it in his sleeve, wiping more make-up off in the process-- 
Mustache is on point, pistol trained.    He spots Soot cowering. 
MUSTACHE (to Soot) Are you hit? 
Soot shakes his head a vigorous "no" as Mustache and his men turn their attention to the bedroom. 
MUSTACHE (CONT'D) (calling out) Mr. Israel!? 
ISRAEL IN HERE! 
MUSTACHE Are you hurt sir!? 
ISRAEL Ivy's trying to kill me! 
SIR IVY FUCK YOU! 
ISRAEL GET IN HERE GODDAMMIT! 
Mustache and his men round the corner into the master bedroom. 
INT. MASTER BEDROOM -- SAME 
Ivy, down on one knee, depth perception shot, trying to reload, bullets slipping through blood-slicked fingers-- Israel lies on the floor behind the bed, breathless, chest heaving, frantically trying to pull the small automatic pistol out of his overnight bag. 
MUSTACHE (advancing on Ivy) Drop-that-gun-right-now! 
One of the bodyguards spots the body of Beanie, lying dead in the remnants of the coffee table. 
SECURITY MEMBER #1 Jesus, he got Beanie... (back to Mustache) He shot Beanie! 
ISRAEL What? 
Ivy hears this, let's the gun slide from his hand, standing, eye swollen to a bleeding slit. 
MUSTACHE GET ON THE GROUND! 
Ivy, looking past them, seeing Beanie's lifeless body, laying there. Israel peers out, sees the same thing. 
ISRAEL Jesus Christ... 
Two of the bodyguards rush to Beanie, bending over his body, checking for vitals. Ivy, suspended in the doorway, stunned. One of the security team looks back; no good...he's gone. Just then, the phone stops ringing. 
ISRAEL (CONT'D) (looking up at Ivy) ...you just murdered Beanie... 
Ivy, shocked, dismayed. Israel, starting to see his sweetheart deal with the Feds go up in smoke. He immediately mobilizes. 
ISRAEL (CONT'D) (to Mustache) Hey! (pointing to Ivy) Get him out-- muscle him if you have to. Take him down the quietly, use the service exit. Then get back up here and we'll handle the rest of this. (off Mustache's look) What? Is there somebody else in there? 
Soot, from the other room, careful to keep his face concealed. 
VITOLI Eees Vitoli. 
Israel, a grimace...two too many people involved. Israel nods, thinking, does a bump of coke, right out in the open. 
ISRAEL (to security) Avert your eyes gents, y'didn't see that. (beat, rolls neck) Okay Vitoli, listen these last few minutes make you a material witness, do you understand what that means? 
VITOLI ...How can I be of assistance... 
ISRAEL You do know what that means! Tremendous, that's the attitude. (beat, clutching chest) Alright, Vitoli, hang tight for half a tic, we've got a special sort of "clean-up" we gotta do here, alright? 
Soot nods. 
ISRAEL (CONT'D) (to Mustache) What's he doing, is he getting this? 
Mustache, glancing over at Soot, seeing him nod. 
MUSTACHE Yeah, he's nodding. 
ISRAEL Good. Now Move. 
Mustache and his men brace Ivy, taking advantage of his disorientation and dismay and swiftly escorting him out.

SGT. DIGNAM (CONT'D) Somebody, as you may already know, stole one hundred microprocessors from the Mass Processor Corp out Route 128. They're the kind of processors they put into computers that can put a cruise missile up the ass of a camel from the other side of the planet. That's what they do out there on "America's Technology Highway". Worth a hundred grand apiece. Guy worked for the company two months walked out the door with a box of processors on Tuesday, has a ticket booked for Florida on Wednesday, but on Thursday he gets found in a dumpster. You know where this dirt ball started his life? Southie projects. 
COLIN What was his name? The, ah, departed. 
SGT. DIGNAM Myles Kennefick. Got the job with a forged UMass transcript. UMass Boston, which incidentally happens to be in... 
LAZIO South Boston? 
SGT. DIGNAM Who forged your transcript, dickhead? 
COLIN I know that guy. His father runs the Hibernian Liquor Mart. Kennefick's. 
ELLERBY We are not here to solve the "Case of the Dead Scumbag". We are here to nail Costello. 
COLIN stands down, embarrassed. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: (2) 
SGT. DIGNAM We got a guy says that   he hears Costello is moving the   processors to China...that he set   up the whole fuckin' job and popped   Kennefick. (LAZIO is writing, lawyerish.) You don't want to miss   it if Costello takes a dump. 
ELLERBY We'd miss less if your informants were available to us, and of course to the FBI (Bureau)... 
LAZIO Without asking for details, do you have anyone in with Costello presently? 
SGT. DIGNAM Maybe. Maybe not. Maybe fuck yourself. My theory on Feds is they're like mushrooms. Feed 'em shit and keep in the dark. You girls have a nice day. 
EXT. A STREET OF TENEMENTS IN SOUTHIE. DAY 
BILLY steps off a bus at a corner. He goes up to a house, and knocks on the door. A Southie hag answers. On an oxygen cylinder, smoking. 
BILLY'S AUNT Billy? 
BILLY nods. 
BILLY Aunt Cathy? 
His aunt takes her cigarette out of her mouth and then embraces him fiercely. BILLY takes it like the imposter he is. But he might well love his aunt. 
BILLY'S AUNT Good to see you. Good to see you. 
INT. BILLY'S AUNT'S KITCHEN. DAY 
BILLY is eating soup. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY'S AUNT They said you were in the Staties, I couldn't believe it. 
BILLY I got kicked out about four months ago. 
SEAN It was in the papers. 
Sean is a villain leaning in a doorway. Bad tie: he takes it off. He has been at a funeral. 
BILLY Well. So you know. 
SEAN And why are we graced with your presence? 
BILLY I brought your mother some pictures of my father. 
It's true. They are on the table. 
BILLY (CONT'D) My mother had them. My mother's dead. 
SEAN (reflexively) I'm sorry. I'm sorry for your troubles. 
Sean opens the fridge, opens a beer, and hands it to BILLY. He opens one for himself. 
SEAN (CONT'D) I was at a funeral myself. Myles Kennefick, knew him in school. Beat the fuck out of him seven or eight times as a matter of fact. (affably to Billy) You workin'? 
BILLY No. 
EXT. THE PORCH OF THE THREE-DECKER. LATER 
Sean and BILLY are still drinking beer. 
SEAN When did I see you after that? 
BILLY Not for a long time. Down the cape after Rose's wedding. I think. 
SEAN Fuck, oh shit. I remember that, dude. I had that fuckin' buck knife, right, and I cut all the brass numbas off the doors at the hotel. I was trippin'...All of them. That was a night. 
Sean looks deflated. 
BILLY Listen, I got twenty thousand dollars when my mother died. Insurance. 
SEAN Yeah? 
BILLY In your line of work, if I gave you ten thousand dollars what could you give me back? 
SEAN My line of work... I'm not in that line of work just presently because I don't have ten thousand dollars. As a matter of fact I have never had ten thousand dollars. 
BILLY That's what I'm saying. 
Sean nods, and nods. 
SEAN You know what we usually say at these moments. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BILLY You fuckin' moron. What are you talking about? I'm not a cop. I'm your cousin. 
INT. BILLY'S CAR. NIGHT 
BILLY is waiting. Sean comes out of a squalid looking house and gets into a car. Fast. Billy puts the car in gear. 
SEAN Fuckin' Ricans think they know everything. If they knew shit they wouldn't be Puerto Ricans. 
He has a paper bag full of money. He opens a beer.

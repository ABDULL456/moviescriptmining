EXT. BACKYARD. ROONEY 
He's standing outside the fence. He's missing a shoe. His suit pants are torn from the crotch to the knee. His suit coat pocket is torn off. His hair's messed and there're grass-stains on his knees and elbows. He's looking in at the dog. 
ROONEY That's a $28.00 dress shoe, you worthless mutt!

Ferris is leading the way down Michigan Avenue. He's hustling through the crowd. He has Sloane by the hand. She's jogging to keep up. Cameron's a few steps behind. He keeps bumping into people. Ferris and Sloane make the turn at Wacker Driver and disappear into the Stone Container Building. Cameron follows, mumbling again. 
CAMERON Money...tits...please...

Rooney's sitting on the porch patting a bloody knee with his handkerchief. The delivery man hops up on the steps. Rooney looks up at him. He greets Rooney cheerily. 
DELIVERY MAN Howdy! 
He presses the doorbell. A beat and we hear Ferris' recording. 
FERRIS' VOICE Who is it? 
The Deliver Man presses the intercom. 
DELIVERY MAN Focus on Flowers. I have a delivery. 
FERRIS' VOICE I'm sorry but I can't come to the door right now. I'm very ill and I'm afraid...

DELIVERY MAN As I heard it from our mailman he was supposedly born with only half a kidney. 
FERRIS' VOICE Have a nice day. 
DELIVERY MAN (to the intercom) Thank you. (continues) I don't know the details. But my boss had to send to Milwaukee to get more orchids. He's very popular. 
Rooney is flabbergasted. 
DELIVERY MAN Nobody's home here? 
ROONEY No. 
DELIVERY MAN You gonna be around for awhile? 
ROONEY I imagine so. 
DELIVERY MAN You wanna keep an eye on these? 
Rooney looks at the flowers. Then he looks at the Delivery Man. 
DELIVERY MAN (happy sigh) It really touches me that so many people are rallying behind this guy. I guess there's hope for the human race afterall. 
He hands the arrangement to Rooney. 
DELIVERY MAN Gotta run. 
He bounds off the porch and trots to the truck. Rooney looks incredulously at the arrangement. He opens the attached card. 
ROONEY (defeated) Oh, Christ...

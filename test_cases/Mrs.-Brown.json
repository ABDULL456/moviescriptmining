{"train": "Mrs.Brown \nMRS BROWN BY JEREMY BROCK \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT \nBegin on black.  The sound of rain driving into trees. Something wipes frame and we are suddenly hurtling through a forest on the shoulders of a wild-eyed, kilted JOHN BROWN.  Drenched hair streaming, head swivelling left and right, as he searches the lightening-dark.  A crack to his left.  He spins round, raises his pistol, smacks past saplings and plunges on. \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT \nClose-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree and heaves for air.  A face in its fifties, mad-fierce eyes, handsome, bruised lips, liverish.  He goes on searching the dark. Stops.  Listens through the rain.  A beat.  Thinking he hears a faint thump in the distance, he swings round and races on. \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT \nBROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length, breath coming harder and harder.  But even now there's a ghost grace, a born hunter's grace.  He leaps fallen branches, swerves through turns in the path, eyes forward, never stumbling once. \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT \nBROWN bursts into a clearing, breaks to the centre and stops.  With his pistol raised, he turns one full slow circle.  His eyes take in every swerve and kick of the wildly swaying trees. \nThere's a crack and a branch snaps behind him.  He spins round, bellows deep from his heart: \nBROWN God save the Queen!! \nAnd fires. \nNothing happens.  The trees go on swaying, the storm goes on screaming and BROWN just stands there, staring into empty space.  A pause. \nSlowly, he starts to frown as the fact begins to dawn on him that he is alone.  He stares at the thrashing trees, waving their mocking arms at him.  His hand lets the pistol drop to his side.  He feels the rain drench down his face. And now, for the first time, we see that his socks have fallen to his ankles and his knees are cut to shreds.  He shifts a foot.  His dress-shoes are covered in mud.  He goes on staring into the dark.  Nothing. Just the wind and rain.  Gradually, we pull back, higher and higher.  As we do, we hear the quiet cultivated voice: \nFADE TO BLACK. \nCAPTION: \"1864\" \nFADE IN: \nPONSONBY (V.O.) I have sent for a Mr. John BROWN from Balmoral.  Her majesty has mentioned him, on one or two occasions, as being a most devoted outdoor servant to Prince Albert during his last days there... \nJohn BROWN is now just a tiny figure dwarfed by the storm. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nThe screen is black.  As the camera pulls back, we discover that we are looking at a black night-gown. \nQueen VICTORIA is sitting at her dressing table, while an elderly HAIRDRESSER, also in black, works at her hair. \nPONSONBY (V.O.) ... The depths of the Queen's sorrow remain impenetrable.  She has now restricted herself to a regime of such ferocious introspection that we are all at our wits' end... \nINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, PRINCE ALBERT'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nA bust of the Prince Consort is draped in black.  His desk is laid out as if for work.  A VALET is brushing one of his suits before laying it carefully on the bed. \nPONSONBY (V.O.) ... The Household continues, at her instruction, to observe the rituals now so familiar to her, in a vain attempt to render vivid that which can never be revived... \nClose-up on a small table as a shaving brush is placed carefully beside a dish of freshly poured water. \nINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN VICTORIA'S DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nThe hairdresser is pulling VICTORIA's hair back into the widow's cape.  For the first time, we see her face.  It is set in a mask of severity. \nJENNER Congratulations, Your Royal Highness! \nBERTIE Thank you, Doctor. \nJENNER A boy, I hear.  Excellent, excellent. \nBERTIE Yes. (beat) Albert Victor.  Eddie for short.  What do you think? \nPONSONBY A fine choice, sir. \nJENNER Excellent! \nEXT. DOCKSIDE, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY \nJOHN BROWN leads his pony gently up the ramp and into the carrier bearing the Royal coat of arms.  The DRIVER leans in. \nDRIVER Are you riding up front? \nBROWN looks straight at this man, quiet and reserved. \nBROWN I'll stay with the pony, thank you. She's all the way from Deeside and she's not sure she likes you yet. \nThe DRIVER shrugs and slams the doors on them. \nINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, CORRIDOR AND QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY \nVICTORIA reaches the dining room door and takes a deep breath.  LADY ELY and LADY CHURCHILL stop a pace behind. \nVICTORIA How many? \nLADY ELY is slightly taken aback. \nLADY ELY The Royal Family and senior members of the household, ma'am. \nVICTORIA Just them? \nLADY ELY Yes, ma'am. \nVICTORIA closes her eyes, then steels herself and steps through the door. \nINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY \nEveryone stiffens as VICTORIA walks in.  Acknowledging the other diners with a quick nod, the Queen takes her place. \nShe flaps open her napkin and, bang on cue, everyone else sits and does the same.  The meal is served immediately by waiting SERVANTS, who plonk the food down without ceremony. \nIt's a very ordinary meal of meat and vegetables.  VICTORIA starts eating heartily, straight away.  Everyone does the same. \nOnly the clink of cutlery and the same eerie silence. \nEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY \nThe Royal horse-carrier rattles into the grounds and on down the driveway past the beautiful, manicured lawns stretching away towards the ornate twin towers of Osborne House.  A few outdoor servants watch its progress curiously. \nINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S DINING ROOM - DAY \nThe silence continues as VICTORIA finishes her plain pudding.  Immediately, servants appear at every place and whip away the pudding bowls whether their owners have finished or not.  Nobody thinks this odd; it is part of the routine.  DOCTOR JENNER clears his throat. \nJENNER We're expecting Brown this afternoon, ma'am. \nVICTORIA Whom? \nBROWN glances up the corridor. \nBROWN So, is passing wind out of the question or do I need permission for that? \nPONSONBY refuses to acknowledge what he has heard.  They reach the door of the Royal Chamber and he concludes the interview. \nPONSONBY As I am sure you remember from Balmoral, you do not talk while in Her Majesty's presence unless Her Majesty addresses you directly. \nBROWN refuses to answer, so PONSONBY knocks.  After a moment, the door is opened by LADY ELY who ushers them in. \nINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY \nBROWN walks stiffly into the room and stops.  PONSONBY waits by the door. \nPONSONBY (O.S.) Mr Brown, ma'am. \nVICTORIA is bent over the desk, working at one of her numerous red boxes.  She scribbles furiously at a letter, underlining and accenting words as she goes.  Finally, LADY ELY steps up to her side and whispers something in her ear. She carries on working. \nBROWN has time to survey the room.  Dominating everything are the same black-wreathed busts and portraits of Prince Albert glimpsed in the corridor. \nFinally, VICTORIA nods and LADY ELY beckons BROWN forward. He steps up in front of the desk and waits.  VICTORIA looks up and BROWN bows deeply. \nSilence. \nShe stares at him for a long moment without apparently registering who he is.  He towers over her, in bright tartan, while she sits hunched in her seat, all in black and knotted with tension. \nFinally, she finds her voice.  She sounds nervous and edgy. \nVICTORIA Mr Brown. \nBROWN Ma'am. \nVICTORIA You are here safely. \nBROWN Aye, ma'am. \nVICTORIA You are well? \nBROWN I am. \nVICTORIA And the pony? \nBROWN She's well, too. \nVICTORIA blinks at the sight of him.  His presence is bringing him back.  A beat. \nVICTORIA Your family sent cards.  It was much appreciated. \nBROWN I'm glad of it. \nIn an effort to control her emotions, VICTORIA now sounds the same severe note as at lunch.  But BROWN, unlike others, seems unaffected. \nVICTORIA My husband was always very complimentary in speaking of you.  He would have approved, I am sure, of my calling on you in this way. (beat) I trust it does not inconvenience you too much. \nBROWN I've no family, ma'am, apart from my brothers and sisters. \nVICTORIA Yes. (beat) You have a brother in service here, do you not? (furrowing her brow) I forget his name. \nBROWN Archie. \nVICTORIA Yes. (beat) That will be company for you. \nARCHIE It's better than shovelling horse shit. \nBROWN If you were looking for promotion, you should have picked one of the healthier ones. \nARCHIE She's hardly a full hamper herself. \nBROWN (beat) It's only grief makes her like she is. \nARCHIE Three years, John.  Is that not a bit long to be grieving? \nBROWN She loved him. \nARCHIE Come on, man.  There's love and there's ... \nBROWN What? \nARCHIE You know what I mean. \nBROWN I'm not sure I do, Archie. \nARCHIE There's love and there's behaving like you do because there's nobody to tell you not to. \nHold on BROWN.  He lets it go and moves on.  Across the hall, he spots the pretty ASSISTANT DRESSER watching them. \nBROWN Which one of us is she flirting with? \nARCHIE The good-looking one. \nBROWN Aye?  Then she's obviously not got enough to do. \nARCHIE You work the system right, you could ask her yourself.  Just be thankful you're not working for Household.  The Queen never lets them out of her sight.  But wee spats like us can slip through the net, easy. \nA beat.  BROWN stares straight at him. \nBROWN I'm no wee spat, ARCHIE. \nINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - MORNING \nThe next day, VICTORIA and her ladies are hurrying down a corridor on her way into the dining room.  VICTORIA suddenly stops and stares out of the windows.  Her entourage are several steps past her before they realize what's happened and scurry back to take up their positions behind. \nNow we see what has caught her attention.  BROWN is standing in the courtyard below, by his pony.  She watches him for a moment, then without reacting, walks on. \nEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE - AFTERNOON \nSome hours later.  It is now raining. \nA gaggle of ROYAL GRANDCHILDREN hurry out of a carriage from their afternoon recreational while their NANNIES frantically try to keep them dry under the umbrellas.  John BROWN stands tall and erect on the gravel while they rush around him, laughing and giggling. \nINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER CORRIDOR - EVENING \nRain on the window.  VICTORIA is walking in the opposite direction down the corridor with her entourage.  She stops at the same place as before. \nVICTORIA (as if she had not seem him earlier) Who is that? \nLady Ely peers through the rain. \nLADY ELY It's Mr Brown, ma'am. \nVICTORIA What is he doing there? \nLADY ELY He appears to be ... standing by his horse. \nA few minutes later, BROWN is in the process of stabling his horse.  Suddenly he turns. \nVICTORIA is standing at the far end of the stable with her entourage. \nVICTORIA Mr Brown. \nBROWN Yes, ma'am. \nVICTORIA You have been told repeatedly not to stand in the courtyard unless requested to do so. \nBROWN Yes, ma'am. \nVICTORIA Then why do you persist in doing it? \nBROWN Because I think Her Majesty is wrong. If ever there was a poor soul who needed fresh air, it is her. \nA beat. \nVICTORIA The Queen will ride out if and when she chooses. \nBROWN And I intend to be there when she's ready. \nSilence.  The two of them stare at each other. \nEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY \nThe next day, high and wide over the stunningly manicured landscape.  Long lawns, wind-cropped copses and in the distance, the glittering sea. \nEXT. OSBORNE HOUSE, THE GROUNDS - DAY \nVICTORIA sits side-saddle on a horse.  BROWN leads her in silence. \nEXT. CLIFFTOP - DAY \nVICTORIA looks up. \nVICTORIA Prince Albert was going to build a bench here.  He thought it one of the best views in Osborne. \nBROWN It's a fine spot, ma'am. \nVICTORIA He thought so, yes. \nShe stares ahead. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) In everything I do and everything I say, I try to think, as much as possible, what he would do, or say, if he were here now.  My Private Secretary wishes me to return to public duties-- \nShe stops abruptly, but BROWN cuts in. \nBROWN If Prince Albert were here today, he'd tell him a thing or two. \nVICTORIA Sir Henry is not alone.  They all wish it. (beat) The same people who refused to grant my husband the title of King because he was deemed of insufficient rank-- \nShe stops again, cutting quickly back to small-talk. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) It is a fine spot for a bench, is it not? \nBROWN Aye, ma'am. \nVICTORIA Yes. \nA pause. \nBROWN nods.  All conversation stops as the under servant bursts back in.  She halts at the door, looking blankly from Bertie's valet to the elderly butler.  A beat.  The old man stiffens and makes his way to the middle of the table. \nBROWN looks up from his soup. \nBROWN Am I the only one eating? \nWith a clatter of spoons, everyone obediently eats. \nINT. OSBORNE HOUSE, DRAWING ROOM - DAY \nA few days later.  A morning \"drawing room.\"  Standing round the unlit fireplace are DOCTOR JENNER, LADY ELY, LADY CHURCHILL, the two LADIES IN WAITING and PRINCESS ALEXANDRA.  All are dressed against the icy wind that whistles through the open window where VICTORIA sits knitting busily while BERTIE stands beside her, coat buttoned up to the collar.  PONSONBY has stationed himself opposite, beside a desk piled high with red dispatch boxes. He runs through the daily itinerary. \nPONSONBY Lord Clarendon arrives, by invitation, at eleven o'clock, followed at twelve by a picnic in the grounds to celebrate Princess Alice's birthday. Dispatches, as usual, at two. (finishes, then coughs) The Chancellor writes to say that, by happy coincidence, he will be in Cowes for the weekend.  He asks if Your Majesty might grant him an audience. \nVICTORIA Why? \nPONSONBY He thought, perhaps, Your Majesty might wish to be informed of the latest developments in government. \nVICTORIA No.  I shall be out walking. \nA beat.  BERTIE watches closely now.  PONSONBY coughs again, nervous. \nPONSONBY Then perhaps Your Majesty might consider it opportune if the Prince of Wales were to meet him on your behalf? \nVICTORIA stiffens.  She speaks without turning. \nVICTORIA On no account. \nPONSONBY gives up.  Politely, but firmly, BERTIE takes up the reins. \nBERTIE Mama, I really do think it's time we made ourselves a little more ... available. \nVICTORIA carries on knitting. \nBERTIE (CONT'D) I think we must accept our position in the country is not entirely unrelated to the continued absence of the Monarchy from public life. (silence) I thought perhaps we might consider a small gesture of some kind? \nVICTORIA looks up sharply. \nVICTORIA Gesture? \nBERTIE I thought, a dinner for our ambassadors perhaps? \nVICTORIA (cutting in firmly) No dinners, Bertie. (beat) Why are you dressed for outdoors? \nBERTIE It's so infernally cold in here. \nVICTORIA Cold is good-- (calling across) Is that not so, Dr. Jenner?! \nJENNER I'm sorry, ma'am? \nVICTORIA Cold is good! \nJENNER Excellent, ma'am, excellent. (trying his hand) But perhaps if her Majesty were to consider accompanying her new-found physical vigor with the benefits of mental activity... \nVICTORIA (becoming very agitated) Why am I being lectured in this way?! \nJENNER Forgive me, Your Majesty.  In no way did I wish to suggest-- \nVICTORIA (cutting across him) I will not tolerate anybody lecturing me about the responsibility of the monarchy.... \nBERTIE Mother.... \nSTANLEY plops the cartoon on his lap. \nSTANLEY Have you seen this? \nINT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT, LOBBY CORRIDOR - DAY \nA few minutes later, DISRAELI and STANLEY are strolling down the busy lobby corridor.  Throughout their talk, Tory back-benchers bustle up to pat their hero on the back and offer their congratulations. \nSTANLEY Should we take it seriously? \nDISRAELI The cartoon or Her Majesty's absenteeism? \nSTANLEY Well, both. \nDISRAELI The question is, do we need her? \nSTANLEY Surely, you're not suggesting we dispense-- \nDISRAELI My dear Stanley, a Prime Minister with only a handful of friends must respect public opinion. \nThe pass GLADSTONE in a huddle of cohorts. \nDISRAELI (CONT'D) Gossip counts.  Lord Aberdeen was right.  This country is not governed by wisdom but by talk. (beat) Granted, it wouldn't take much to winkle the old girl out of mourning, but if public opinion is against her, then it doesn't do to appear too close. \nSTANLEY So? \nDISRAELI We'll see which way the wind blows. \nDISRAELI sweeps through a prattle of back-benchers. \nEXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY \nBROWN and ARCHIE crash into the water.  It is freezing. BROWN braces himself against the icy shallows by bellowing Burns at the sea. \nBROWN My heart's in the Highlands, my heart is not here!  My heart's in the Highlands a-chasing the deer!  Chasing the wild deer and following the roe! My heart's in the Highlands wherever I go! \nARCHIE is so creased up with laughing, he almost drowns. \nEXT. PUBLIC BEACH, ISLE OF WIGHT - DAY \nA few minutes later, BROWN and ARCHIE hurry back up the cold beach to rub themselves dry.  BROWN is very energized. \nBROWN One box of biscuits, one box of drop tablets, one box of pralines, sixteen chocolate sponges.  It's the same order every week, but does anybody bother to check it?  Now she has to travel all the way to Balmoral without the few luxuries she actually enjoys. \nARCHIE So?  Someone'll send it on ahead. \nBROWN Aye, but will they? \nARCHIE John, it's not your problem what she eats. \nBROWN The woman's surrounded by fools! (beat) She has to be packed and ready to leave by seven thirty tomorrow morning.  Knowing that lot, they'll still be dressing her at eight. \nBROWN takes a nip of whiskey and offers some to his brother. \nARCHIE She's got an army of people to get her up and out. \nBROWN But I'm the only one she trusts. \nARCHIE stares at him.  A beat. \nARCHIE She'll blow hot and cold on you, John, she always does.  You want to be careful. \nThe stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on. \nBROWN Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you. \nVICTORIA (riding alongside) What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming. (beat) Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson. \nBROWN lowers his head. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) (in a softer tone) I mention you in them. \nBROWN says nothing. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) In particular, the occasion when Albert was alive; the Royal Carriage overturned during a storm and you demonstrated such loyal service in returning the Queen and the Princesses safely to Balmoral. \nTaking a sprig of heather from her brooch, VICTORIA holds it out to him.  A beat. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) For friendship. \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY \nA few days later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER and BROWN stand at the chamber-desk, talking over the Queen's itinerary. \nBROWN (briskly) She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early. \nPONSONBY She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires. \nBROWN That can wait till the weekend. \nPONSONBY There are important papers from -- \nBROWN It can wait.  Anything else? \nJENNER Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such a long journey?  She has only just recovered from a severe head cold. \nBROWN If I thought she wasn't up to it, I wouldn't let her go, would I? \nBROWN snaps together his papers and walks out, leaving PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table. \nEXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY \nThe next morning.  The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the grounds.  VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE. \nBERTIE is in mid-plea. \nBERTIE Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop... \nVICTORIA It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged. \nBERTIE Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive? \nVICTORIA It is quite late enough. \nBERTIE But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father -- \nVICTORIA (cutting in angrily) Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock. \nBERTIE Mama... \nVICTORIA And that is my last word on the matter. \nBERTIE Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant. \nBROWN (CONT'D) What happens to John Brown is his business, but the Queen's security will never be compromised! \nBERTIE'S VALET We -- \nBROWN You'll talk when I'm finished! \nBERTIE'S VALET stares at him in astonishment.  BROWN turns back to the table. \nBROWN (CONT'D) That kind of disloyalty will not be tolerated in this house, is that clear? (beat, yelling) I said, is that clear?! \nThere is a general mutter of assent.  BROWN turns and storms out as ARCHIE gets up to follow. \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY \nA few days later, PONSONBY is sitting at his desk, hands to his hips, listening quietly as DOCTOR JENNER reads from his copy of Punch. \nJENNER \"Court Circular, Balmoral.\" (beat) \"On Tuesday, Mr John Brown enjoyed a display of sheep-dipping by local farmers.  On Wednesday, he attended a seance where he was pleased to listen to a recital of Auld Lang Syne by Mr Robert Burns himself ...\" \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE, LOWER CORRIDOR - DAY \nBROWN crashes through a door holding a copy of the same journal. \nJENNER (O.S.) \"... On Thursday, Mr John Brown walked on the slopes, accompanied by family and friend ...\" \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY \nBROWN storms up to PONSONBY's door. \nJENNER (O.S.) Mr Brown retired early. \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE, HENRY PONSONBY'S ROOMS - DAY \nBROWN bursts in on PONSONBY and JENNER, slamming down his copy of Punch on the desk.  He is furious but controlled. \nBROWN If I find out that you had anything to do with this, I will have you sacked. \nPONSONBY I believe that decision rests with Her Majesty. \nBROWN Don't think I can't persuade her. \nPONSONBY I don't doubt that the Queen was highly amused.  She has always had a very healthy sense of humor. \nBROWN This is a slur on her good name. \nPONSONBY In as much as the article is about yourself, I think you must now accept that the public has a right to its interest in you. \nBROWN Nobody has any rights over me. \nPONSONBY We are all of us subject to forces beyond our control, Mr Brown, even you. \nBROWN stares at him in silence.  A beat. \nBROWN You'll regret saying that. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nCAPTION: \"1867\" \nFADE IN: \nINT. THE HOUSES OF PARLIAMENT - DAY \nDEAN WELLSELLY (completely lost) I beg your pardon? \nDISRAELI opens the copy of Punch and hands it to Dean Wellselly.  The Dean clears his throat and starts to read. \nDISRAELI (as Wellselly reads) One of our madder brethren in the house was calling for disestablishment of the monarchy. \nDean Wellselly looks up from the article, horrified. \nDEAN WELLSELLY Good Lord. \nSTANLEY (playing the soft glove) I'm sure it won't come to that. \nDISRAELI (the hard glove) No.  But it has now become a matter for our consciences. (beat) I was just telling Stanley how vital it is that the nation should feel the visible influence of the Sovereign. As a reminder that Parliament, indeed my own ministry, depends on the will of the Queen. \nDEAN WELLSELLY nods his head gravely.  Over his shoulder, STANLEY is gaping at DISRAELI's silky distortion of the party political maneuver into a moral imperative. \nDEAN WELLSELLY I couldn't agree with you more, but I am only Dean of Windsor.  I don't understand what ... \nDISRAELI interrupts. \nDISRAELI We hear from Balmoral that Mr Brown is interesting Her Majesty in some of the forms of worship associated with ... low-church Presbyterian. \nSilence.  DEAN WELLSELLY'S face is a picture of unrestrained horror.  Low-church.  Presbyterian. \nDEAN WELLSELLY What can we do? \nDISRAELI Oh, several things. \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY \nSome days later. \nQueen VICTORIA sits at her desk while Henry PONSONBY stands in front of her, holding a copy of The Times. \nVICTORIA Read it. \nPONSONBY Again? \nVICTORIA Read it! \nPONSONBY coughs once and begins again. \nPONSONBY \"The Times wishes to join the rest of Her Majesty's loyal subjects in expressing its deep joy at the news that the Queen is soon to come out of her mourning.\" \nVICTORIA glowers at him. \nVICTORIA Who told them that? \nPONSONBY I have no idea. \nVICTORIA Why not? \nPONSONBY I -- forgive me, ma'am, I am no wiser than yourself. \nSuddenly, VICTORIA's temper goes and she shouts at him. \nVICTORIA No-one should think themselves wiser than me! (beat) It is not for any of the Queen's subjects to presume to tell Her Majesty when and where She should come out of mourning.  It is the Queen's sorrow that keeps her secluded!  It is Her overwhelming amount of work and responsibility, work which She feels will soon wear her out entirely! \nPONSONBY Your Majesty -- \nVICTORIA (cutting right through him) Is it not enough that She is uncheered and unguided that she should also have to suffer these malicious rumors?! (a pause, more quietly) I am not a fool. (beat) I know there are those in the establishment too afraid to attack me and so they attack my dearest friends. Sometimes -- I feel that Brown is all I have left of Albert. (beat) And now they attack Brown too. \nBROWN Well, don't stand where you shouldn't! \nThe UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs.  A few SERVANTS exchange looks.  BROWN seems more determined than ever to exert his control. \nEXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT \nThat night. \nCarrying an old storm lamp high over his head, BROWN walks towards the stables. \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY \nThe next day. \nBROWN is on horseback, riding with VICTORIA through the grounds.  He is still jumpy, eyes flicking left and right, searching for intruders.  They are being followed at a distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback.  VICTORIA frowns peevishly. \nVICTORIA Must they always follow us? \nBROWN I ordered it.  It's for your own safety. \nVICTORIA Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next. \nBROWN doesn't react.  A beat. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) Am I not safe enough with you, John? \nBROWN Aye. (looking away) But there are Fenians reported on the mainland. \nVICTORIA (tutting irritably) The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure. \nBROWN (snapping back) I'll decide when it's exaggerated. \nBROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the conversation.  A beat.  He pulls up suddenly, staring at the shadows in the copse. \nVICTORIA Is anything the matter, John? (beat) John? \nHe stares for along moment and then lets it go. \nBROWN Nothing's the matter. \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT \nBROWN marches down the line of horse boxes.  A stable-lad, BARNEY, is feeding the horses.  He looks twitchy. \nBROWN Hey, Barney. \nBARNEY Mr Brown, sir -- \nBROWN It's cold out there tonight, Barney. \nReaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles.  The animal lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle. \nBROWN (CONT'D) Yeah, there's a good girl. (to Barney) Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it. \nBARNEY Yeah, yeah, I did. \nBROWN Good man.  And is she all right? \nBARNEY Yeah. \nBROWN Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow? \nBROWN I've got my duties to attend to. \nARCHIE Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere. \nBROWN She'll be worried about me. \nARCHIE She'll get over it. \nBROWN I can't let her down now, Archie. \nARCHIE And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant. \nBROWN Oh, I'm much more than that. \nARCHIE Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants. \nBROWN You watch your tongue. \nARCHIE Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know. \nBROWN You know nothing about her! \nARCHIE When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you. \nBROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card showing a coy picture of a pretty woman.  He holds it up, eyes blazing. \nBROWN From the Queen! \nHe reads out the inscription. \nBROWN (CONT'D) My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter. (beat) To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R. (he thrusts it in his brother's face) Best friend! \nARCHIE Aye. \nBROWN She means it. \nARCHIE stares at him. \nARCHIE She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you. \nBROWN Get out. (beat) Out! \nARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him. \nBROWN (CONT'D) OUT!! \nARCHIE steps outside and BROWN is left alone. \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY \nThe next day.  VICTORIA sits at her desk.  PONSONBY hands her letters to sign. \nPONSONBY ... to be followed by a visit from Lady Bridport.  She is keen to secure a place for her niece as Maid of Honor. \nVICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back. \nVICTORIA I am tired. \nPONSONBY coughs. \nPONSONBY There is one other matter. \nDISRAELI A man can refuse only so many invitations from his Queen.  It was remiss of me not to come earlier. \nVICTORIA smiles.  BROWN stares. \nBROWN What do you know about the Highlands? \nDISRAELI I am a blank sheet. \nBROWN Do you hunt? \nDISRAELI Occasionally. \nBROWN Dare say you can be taught. \nDISRAELI To shoot perhaps, but not to kill. \nBROWN If you hunt, you kill. \nDISRAELI counters effortlessly. \nDISRAELI Well then, I'll do my best. \nEXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY \nStaying close to the ground we develop through a series of shots showing the other highlands -- sheet rain against heather and gorse, rivulets of water slashing through mud, crude pathways sliding in wind and all ball-breakingly cold. \nComing up the hill, we begin to make out a hunting party. The sound first.  Like a small army, crashing their way up the winding path.  GHILLIES urging on their horses and dogs, guns and equipment jangling off pony-hacks an then the tall figure of JOHN BROWN striding out in front. \nMaking no concession to anyone, he force-marches them up the hill, eyes on the hunt ahead. Behind them trot the men on horseback -- DISRAELI, PONSONBY, BERTIE and other GENTLEMEN, each led by GHILLIES and ATTENDANTS, among them ARCHIE. \nSuddenly, BROWN stops and raises a hand.  The party halts. \nHe listens for a second.  Satisfied that he has found his quarry, he brings his hand down and the party of gentlemen dismount as quietly as they can. \nAs he waits, BROWN winces slightly from the pain in his side.  He pulls a flask of whiskey from his sporran and drinks.  All the time, DISRAELI keeps his eyes on BROWN. \nEXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY \nThe stalking. \nEveryone is now fanned out along the hillside, a ghillie to each gentleman, slowly and silently moving up the hill. \nDISRAELI stalks with BROWN, panting hard to keep up, eyes on his man, trying to make no sound. \nSuddenly, BROWN stops.  Very slowly he rises.  DISRAELI rides alongside and sees ... \nA huge stag staring majestically across the hillside. \nKeeping his movements smooth and slow, BROWN brings up his rifle, cocks it and offers DISRAELI the kill.  With a deferential gesture of the hands, DISRAELI declines.  BROWN stares at him a split-second, raises the rifle to his shoulder and fires. \nEXT. HIGHLANDS, GLEN GELDER - DAY \nThe kill. \nA rapid montage of guns firing, as we cut to ... \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY \nBROWN sweeps in from the hunt, DISRAELI dripping at his side. \nBROWN (demonstrating with his rifle) Always remember, you keep it tight to your shoulder, you absorb the kick. Aim for the head.  Then imagine it's Gladstone. \nARCHIE What's this? \nBROWN It's a diary. \nARCHIE Be careful who sees it. \nBROWN What do you take me for? \nARCHIE turns back to BROWN. \nARCHIE You should have someone look after you. \nBROWN I'm all right.  I just need to rest up a wee bit. (feeling everything spin) The room ... You don't have to stay. \nBROWN shuts his eyes and starts to drift.  ARCHIE watches over him. \nARCHIE The place is a mess. \nBROWN I can't move to tidy. \nARCHIE It's what the maids are for. \nBROWN I'm not having some prattler going through my things. \nA beat. \nARCHIE Won't you give yourself a rest, John? She's other people to look out for her. \nBROWN She needs me, Archie.  She canna do without me, she said it to my face. (his hands come up to cover his eyes) How can I stop now? \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE, SERVANT'S CORRIDOR - DAY \nDawn the next morning. \nBROWN is scrambling into his jacket as he hurries down the stairs. \nEXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY \nBROWN crashes out of a side-door -- just fully dressed -- to be met by the smiling figure of DISRAELI.  He is got up in smart walking boots, plus-fours and a tweed jacket. \nBROWN You sent for me. \nDISRAELI I've been called back to London.  My last day.  I thought I might take a walk on Lochnagar. \nBROWN stares straight back. \nEXT. LOCHNAGER - DAY \nAn hour later, BROWN leads DISRAELI up the hill.  BROWN has his head down, on with the job.  DISRAELI slows to a halt. \nDISRAELI Princes and Lords are but the breath of kings, An honest man's the noblest work of God. (beat) You must miss such magnificent views. \nBROWN I don't think about it. \nThey reach the top and continue along the high ground. DISRAELI glances at BROWN and notices the limp. \nDISRAELI Forgive me, I've called you out and you should have been resting. \nBROWN I'm fine. \nDISRAELI You're injured. \nDISRAELI The truth is, the Queen would be safer doing her duty and returning south to her public.  John Bull loves her and John Bull is her best defense. \nBROWN Her mind is set.  She won't change now. \nDISRAELI She trusts you, John. \nDISRAELI is right on his shoulder now, like his own voice. \nBROWN They don't see it. \nDISRAELI See what? \nBROWN The threat. (beat) I tell them, but they don't see it. \nDISRAELI They aren't as watchful as you. \nBROWN Too busy looking after themselves. \nDISRAELI The greasy pole. \nBROWN No loyalty. \nDISRAELI No love. \nSilence.  For a moment BROWN seems unaware that someone else has said that. \nBROWN I promised to protect her from people like you. \nDISRAELI For once in my life, I am not the issue. \nBROWN She'll never understand it. \nDISRAELI In time, she will. \nBROWN She'll think I betrayed her. \nDISRAELI But others will know that you acted for the greater good. \nBROWN stares off into the distance. \nEXT. LOCH MUICK - DAY \nThe next day. \nBROWN is rowing VICTORIA across the loch.  The EQUERRIES wait on the shore. \nVICTORIA trails her hand in the water, frowning at the surface.  BROWN concentrates on the oars, slipping them carefully through the water. \nVICTORIA I received a letter today from Mr Disraeli.  Parliament is calling for my return to public duties. (beat) Why won't they let us be? \nBROWN does not answer. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) He insists that the country expects me to preside over the opening of the new session.  I refuse to offer sustenance to enable his weakening grip. Besides, you know how much I should hate it.  It frightens me. \nShe notices that BROWN has said nothing. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) John? \nBROWN does not look at her.  Finally: \nBROWN We can't always have what we wish. \nVICTORIA nods, then turns and looks about at the others. PRINCESS ALEXANDRA is seated at the far end of the table. VICTORIA frowns. \nVICTORIA Where is my son? \nPRINCESS ALEXANDRA Prince Albert is at Windsor, ma'am. \nVICTORIA Why is he not here? \nPRINCESS ALEXANDRA He is sick, ma'am. \nVICTORIA Then why are you not with him? \nPRINCESS ALEXANDRA You ordered all members of the Royal Family to attend you at Balmoral. \nVICTORIA What is the matter with him? \nPRINCESS ALEXANDRA He has typhoid fever, ma'am. \nVICTORIA stares blankly at DOCTOR JENNER. \nVICTORIA No.  You are mistaken.  Prince Albert, my husband, had typhoid fever.  I asked what was wrong with my son. \nJENNER The same, your Majesty. \nVICTORIA stops.  She stares down the length of the table. A long pause. \nVICTORIA Why was I not informed? \nJENNER I did not consider it wise, in the circumstances, to tax your nerves. \nVICTORIA How ill is he? \nNo answer. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) (to Alexandra) Alex? \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) He is not well, ma'am. \nA beat. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) I must go to him. \nSuddenly, VICTORIA stands.  Chairs bang back as everyone leaps to their feet. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) We must leave at once. \nAbruptly, VICTORIA turns for the door and the room erupts into activity. \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE, CORRIDOR - DAY \nBROWN stands in the corridor, a little nonplussed by the servants and Householders hurrying about in every direction. \nEXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY \nHalf an hour later, BROWN races up to the Queen's carriage amid a swarm of servants, ladies' maids and Householders rushing to be ready in time. \nSuddenly the huge castle doors open and VICTORIA bustles out with her entourage in tow.  BROWN -- only just in time - yanks open the door for VICTORIA to step past him and take her place.  She ignores him completely. \nBROWN slams the doors.  As he looks up, he sees his brother ARCHIE staring at him from across the courtyard.  For a second the two brothers hold each other's gaze.  It's obvious that ARCHIE has noticed the Queen's indifference. BROWN turns away and mounts the box as the carriage races away under him. \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, PRINCE'S BEDCHAMBER - DAY \nThe others raise their glasses in unison. \nEVERYONE Victoria Regina! \nVICTORIA smiles.  BROWN remains alone by the door. \nDISRAELI (O.S.) The people of England have expressed in a manner which cannot be mistaken, that they will uphold the ancient monarchy of England ... \nINT. CRYSTAL PALACE - DAY \nDISRAELI is delivering his come-back speech at a banquet of Tory delegates. \nDISRAELI ... If the first great object of the Tory Party is to maintain the institutions of the country, the second is, in my opinion, to maintain the Empire of England ... the hereditary, the traditionary policy of the Tory Party.  Go to your homes, teach them these truths, which will soon be imprinted on the conscience of the land ... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nCAPTION: \"1883\" \nFADE IN: \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - NIGHT \nThe sound of rain driven hard against a window.  We creep slowly down the corridor until we are back with the fifty year-old BROWN.  With his whiskey for company, he is sitting at his desk, writing in the diary. \nThe diary-manuscript is now falling apart with wear, but there remain a few blank pages.  Slowly, he fills them in. \nBROWN (V.O.) We should not live in expectation of contentment.  Fifteen years of vigilance will not guarantee peace of mind.  Yesterday, intruders were again reported in the South Wing.  I believe my prompt arrival may have averted any crisis, but it was a timely reminder. It is a great comfort to me that my efforts in securing the Queen's safety over the years have not been in vain. Certainly Her Majesty sends me no word that she's dissatisfied.  And I feel sure that if she were unhappy she would have found the occasion  to speak to me in person, as she has so often done in the past. \nA knock at the door. \nBROWN (CONT'D) What is it? \nWe hear a young PAGE, breathless from running. \nPAGE North woods, sir. \nBROWN grabs his gun and rushes out. \nEXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUADRANGLE - NIGHT \nBROWN appears at the door and strides into the storm.  He walks quickly across the wide quadrangle, rain soaking his hair and clothes. \nTwo GUARDS watch BROWN as he races out into the storm. \nA coin flips through the air to be caught by an outstretched hand.  The second GUARD grins. \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - NIGHT \nBROWN races across the open ground towards the forest. \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT \nAnd now we are back with the opening sequence.  Truncated, severe, and shot from a slightly different angle.  The driving rain, BROWN hurtling through the trees, the crack to his left, he spins and plunges on. \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT \nClose-up on BROWN as he bangs against a tree, heaving for air.  He searches the dark, stops, listens and races on. \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE, FOREST - NIGHT \nBROWN tears through the trees, pistol raised at full arm's length. \n", "test1_input": "A few days later, a party of ARISTOCRATS, MINISTERS, DIPLOMATS, ESCORTS, BUSINESSMAN and WHORES.  Into this brouhaha come DISRAELI, his elderly wife MARY ANNE and the young STANLEY.  It is all eyes and nods here.  Everyone knows everyone. \nDISRAELI Ah, the greasy pole. \nMARY ANNE Don't be facetious, dear. Remember your position. \nDISRAELI It's my position I'm thinking of. \nAcross the room, STANLEY spots BERTIE amid a crowd of acolytes. \nSTANLEY I see the Prince of Wales is here. \nDISRAELI I hope he got his mother's permission. \nSTANLEY smiles faintly.  DISRAELI homes in on a punter and raises his hand, already working the room. \nDISRAELI (CONT'D) Lord Salisbury! \nINT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY \nThe society party is hotting up.  STANLEY is deep in conversation with three SOCIETY LADIES. \nSOCIETY LADY 1 (ridiculously pleased with herself) Why is the Queen penny-wise and pound foolish?  Because she looks after the Browns and lets the sovereigns take care of themselves! \nA peal of naughty laughter.  Unseen, DISRAELI steps up. \nDISRAELI And in your opinion?  Is she foolish? \nThe SOCIETY LADY stares blankly back. \nSOCIETY LADY 1 Well I ... well, I mean to say, it's hardly right, is it? \nDISRAELI What? \nSOCIETY LADY 1 Well, the Queen and -- (appalled whisper) Mr Brown. \nDISRAELI stares at her steadily, already thinking ahead. \nDISRAELI La superstition met le monde entier en flammes. \nSOCIETY LADY 2 (thick as shit) I beg your pardon? \nDISRAELI (changing tack) Has anybody seen this ... Mr Brown? \nSTANLEY He is her personal servant, I believe. \nSOCIETY LADY 1 (knowingly) Follows her wherever she goes. \nDISRAELI He would hardly make a very good personal assistant if he did not. \nINT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY \nBROWN stands by a wall, smiling to himself at the sight of QUEEN VICTORIA struggling to help lay the table while MRS GRANT nervously prattles on. \nMRS GRANT ... it's not my best china.  I mean, it is my best china now, but the family set got stolen last summer. \nVICTORIA Oh, I'm so sorry ... \nMRS GRANT Of course it was no-one on the Estate. More likely one of the lads from Braemar.  Or further even. (beat) I'll fetch the salt. \nMRS GRANT scurries away.  VICTORIA immediately holds up the spoons to BROWN with a questioning look -- above or beside the plate?  He nods her to the top and she quickly carries on. \n", "test1_true": "DISRAELI and MARY ANNE stand with BERTIE and his ACOLYTES. \nBERTIE Mr Disraeli.  Ma'am. \nDISRAELI Your Royal Highness.  What a pleasure to see you here. \nBERTIE Have you met Mr Lyle?  He's in sugar...? \nDISRAELI I don't think I've had that pleasure. \nDISRAELI shakes hands with the fat sugar tycoon who wobbles with drink.  MARY ANNE engages him in conversation while BERTIE turns DISRAELI aside. \nBERTIE No doubt you've heard the rumors. \nDISRAELI I take no account of gossip, Your Highness. \nBERTIE My concern is for the reputation of the Monarchy. \nDISRAELI Of course. \nBERTIE I fear the influence he has on her. The man's word is not to be credited. He is an arriviste of the very lowest water. (beat) She's having a bust cast of him.  In Nero Marquino marble. \nDISRAELI I see. \nBERTIE I would talk to her myself, but she won't listen to me.  She must be persuaded, by someone she respects, to abandon this ridiculous favoritism before a situation develops. \nDISRAELI A situation? \nBERTIE I don't imagine you frequent the Republican Clubs.  But the fact that neither you nor I are members should not blind us to the significance of their existence. (beat) The Tory Party has always been our party. \nDISRAELI I'm flattered you think so. \nBERTIE I tell you, if we don't stick together on this, you could find yourself First President's Opposition. (murdering it) Du Royaum Uni. \nDISRAELI Quite. \nA beat. \nBERTIE I don't think we can overstate the seriousness of this. \nDISRAELI nods and BERTIE walks swiftly back to his party. The moment he's gone, STANLEY steps up to DISRAELI's side. \nSTANLEY What did he want? \nDISRAELI To know when he'll be king. \nINT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY \nVICTORIA, BROWN and the GRANTS are eating around a large table.  Like a wife watching her husband, VICTORIA beams proudly at BROWN as he tells a story. \nBROWN ... so Grant here and myself are riding over Lochnagar and the rain's pouring down in sheets and all we're thinking about is getting home for a drink, when through the gloom Grant spots a couple of poachers.  He gives me a shout and we chase them down towards the loch until Grant has your men up against the stacks and he's shouting and cursing at them, \"Why are you poaching on Royal land?!\"  And one of the little fellas looks up at him and says, \"coz we've come up in the world.\" \nFor a split second, both the GRANTS look petrified, then BROWN and VICTORIA explode into laughter and the GRANTS relax.  Suddenly the GRANTS are helpless with laughter too. Beginning with VICTORIA's glass, BROWN pours out liberal quantities of whiskey all round. \nEXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DUSK \nLater that night, the courtyard is packed with a gaggle of worried HOUSEHOLDERS holding lamps. \nThrough the light, BROWN and VICTORIA clatter into the courtyard on the horse and trap.

I recommend Macdonald's African Embrocation -- \nBROWN (cutting in) Ah, pipe down, man.  The woman's fine. \nVICTORIA We stayed a little longer than expected with Mr and Mrs Grant.  It was most agreeable. \nPONSONBY We were expecting you to return by six. \nVICTORIA And now I am back. \nBROWN cannot resist one more little dig. \nBROWN We took a nip of whiskey. \nVICTORIA To keep out the cold. \nBROWN Aye. \nVICTORIA smiles and BROWN lifts her off the trap.  Before walking in she turns and, in front of everyone, says... \nVICTORIA Thank you, John. \nBROWN bows and the QUEEN walks on.  As she straightens up, he finds PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER staring back at him in utter disbelief at what she has just said.  He turns and leads the horse back to the stables. \nJENNER (under his breath) She's drunk. \nPONSONBY doesn't answer.  He is watching BROWN very closely. \nJENNER (CONT'D) A distinct flushing around the cheeks. She was drunk, I tell you. \nPONSONBY No, she wasn't. \nSilence.  JENNER turns to look at PONSONBY. \nJENNER Surely not ... \nPONSONBY's face is set hard. \nPONSONBY Don't even think about it. \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE, BALLROOM - NIGHT \nA crush of kilted GHILLIES as we slam into the height of the annual Ghillie's Ball. \nThe whole court is reeling through the dance; all of them beholding the extraordinary spectacle of QUEEN VICTORIA and JOHN BROWN dancing together in the middle of the hall. \nPONSONBY and JENNER stand by the wall, watching.  Close-up on PONSONBY'S face as JENNER mutters darkly. \nJENNER Pandora's Box ... \nWith a slam of feet the reel ends, the GHILLIES roar and BROWN and VICTORIA stand smiling at each other in silence.

I've lost him? \nBelow them, BROWN races across the riverbank and undergrowth, unseen. \nJOURNALIST 2 I don't know if there's much worth writing about. \nJOURNALIST 1 Hard to tell. \nBROWN rears up above them and stops. \nBROWN This close enough for you?  Go on!  On your way!

BALMORAL CASTLE, QUEEN'S DRAWING ROOM - DAY \nThe next day. \nQUEEN VICTORIA is playing the piano like she walks, with great vim and vigor.  The tune is some quaint Scottish ballad which she belts out in her clear strong voice, almost drowning out PRINCE ARTHUR, PRINCE LOUISE and PRINCE LEOPOLD who are meant to be accompanying her.  They stand in a nervous semi-circle, fumbling their harmonies. Ignoring them completely, VICTORIA bobs up her head with a quizzical smile to make sure she is being appreciated. \nDISRAELI and the rest of the HOUSEHOLD stand a few yards off, smiling rigidly.  DISRAELI, the consummate politician to his inch-high insteps, out-smiles the lot of them.  This man is in raptures of delight.  And the more liquid his smiles, the happier he makes VICTORIA.  He beams, she belts, until her children are drowned out completely. \nAnd then, with characteristic suddenness, VICTORIA stops playing and launches into one of her tirades.  The HOUSEHOLD wobbles in shock like children on a switch-back, but DISRAELI glides smoothly from delight to sober concern. \nVICTORIA How dare the Irish break with the Anglicans? If Albert were alive today he would never allow the Crown to give up Church patronage.  No, the Irish must be told, very firmly, to stay exactly where they are.  It is the thin edge of the wedge, Mr Disraeli.  Next, you will be telling me that the Crown no longer governs this nation. \nA beat. A nervous silence in the Household. \nDISRAELI Your Majesty remains at the very epicenter of governance.  As for your people, look no further than the sales of your Highland Journals to see in what affection the nation holds their Queen. (beat) You sell even more copies than Mr Dickens. \nVICTORIA But I lack your prose, Mr Disraeli. \nVICTORIA gives him a tiny smile.  DISRAELI acknowledges it, then steers the conversation back. \nDISRAELI Of course I understand your concern. You miss your people. (a pause) And they miss you. \nVICTORIA registers a slight flicker of defensiveness at the implied criticism. \nVICTORIA Then they may read about me. \nDISRAELI Indeed, and for that they are eternally grateful. \nVICTORIA Is that not enough? \nDISRAELI In so many ways ... and yet it is your presence they crave.  A figurehead. \nVICTORIA has the measure of him. \nVICTORIA I never thought to be bullied by you, Mr Disraeli.  You, I thought, understood a widow's grief. \nDISRAELI Forgive me, ma'am, I cannot speak for the nation, only for myself.  As Prime Minister I confess I miss your presence, but that is only an expression of my own selfish desires and I should not burden you with it. \nThe Household waits.  Has he clawed himself back?  VICTORIA acknowledges his apology.  Her voice drops and she talks directly to DISRAELI, straight from the heart. \nVICTORIA I stay here because I am happy. (beat) Is that such a terrible crime? \nDISRAELI No, ma'am. \nAt this moment the far door opens and BROWN walks in. \nBROWN Time for your walk. \nWithout a word, VICTORIA rises from her chair and starts following him out.  As they pass DISRAELI, she stops. \nVICTORIA This is my good John Brown. \nDISRAELI (taking him in) Yes. \nVICTORIA I have asked him to show you a little of Highland life while you are with us at Balmoral. \nBROWN measures DISRAELI suspiciously. \nBROWN What brings you here? \n", "test3_id": 1763}

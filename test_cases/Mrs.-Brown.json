{"test1_input": "The stare at each other until BROWN kicks his horse on. \nBROWN Aye, well, if all you want is a good opinion then he'd be sure to oblige you. \nVICTORIA (riding alongside) What Mr Ponsonby was appreciating was their literary merit, a skill not intimately associated with the knowledge of grooming. (beat) Literary appreciation does not begin and end with Tennyson. \nBROWN lowers his head. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) (in a softer tone) I mention you in them. \nBROWN says nothing. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) In particular, the occasion when Albert was alive; the Royal Carriage overturned during a storm and you demonstrated such loyal service in returning the Queen and the Princesses safely to Balmoral. \nTaking a sprig of heather from her brooch, VICTORIA holds it out to him.  A beat. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) For friendship. \nINT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY \nA few days later, PONSONBY, DOCTOR JENNER and BROWN stand at the chamber-desk, talking over the Queen's itinerary. \nBROWN (briskly) She'll be away on Friday between eight o'clock and six in the evening to visit the Grants in Glasalt.  If she's to make the journey there and back in the day she's to have no distractions the night before.  She'll take a light supper alone in her private drawing room and retire early. \nPONSONBY She'll need to sign dispatches before she retires. \nBROWN That can wait till the weekend. \nPONSONBY There are important papers from -- \nBROWN It can wait.  Anything else? \nJENNER Are you sure Her Majesty is up to such a long journey?  She has only just recovered from a severe head cold. \nBROWN If I thought she wasn't up to it, I wouldn't let her go, would I? \nBROWN snaps together his papers and walks out, leaving PONSONBY and DOCTOR JENNER standing lamely at the table. \nEXT. BALMORAL CASTLE - DAY \nThe next morning.  The ROYAL FAMILY are picnicking in the grounds.  VICTORIA walks along a path accompanied on one side by BROWN, on the other by BERTIE. \nBERTIE is in mid-plea. \nBERTIE Surely it is for the gentlemen to decide when to stop... \nVICTORIA It is a disgusting habit, Bertie.  It should be discouraged. \nBERTIE Yes, but isn't midnight a little excessive? \nVICTORIA It is quite late enough. \nBERTIE But mama, the room was built expressly for that purpose.  It has been a smoking-room by tradition ever since father -- \nVICTORIA (cutting in angrily) Brown's responsibilities are onerous enough already.  He has far too much to do without having to stay up all night waiting for you to go to bed. The smoking-room will be closed and the lights put out at twelve o'clock. \nBERTIE Mama... \nVICTORIA And that is my last word on the matter. \nBERTIE Well, I'm sorry, but I really do think it's too much that the gentlemen of the house should be dictated to by a servant. \n", "test1_true": "BERTIE I beg your pardon? (to VICTORIA) Mama...? \nBefore Bertie can continue, BROWN steps right into his face. \nBROWN I think you should go now. (beat) You've tired your mother enough. \nBERTIE stares back, too stunned to speak.  He glances at his mother, but VICTORIA looks off into the distance as if she has not heard.  BERTIE turns and storms away. \nINT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY \nJOHN BROWN is standing in the doorway of a small cottage watching, with amused detachment, as a middle-aged couple, MR and MRS GRANT, race about their tiny living room, trying desperately to make it presentable for the Queen's sudden visit.  They fling open the windows, slosh water on the fire, tidy up their two grubby BOYS, plump up the cushions, dump knitting under the sofa and try to smarten themselves up, all in the space of a few seconds. \nBROWN There's really no need for this. \nMRS GRANT I'll not have her seeing it like it is! (beat) I know she means well, but I wish she'd warn us she was coming. \nBROWN She thinks if she warned you, you'd go pouring water on the fire and stuffing the knitting under the sofa. \nMR GRANT Aye, well, you can't stop a wife being house-proud. \nMRS GRANT surveys the room critically. \nMRS GRANT All right. (beat) Show her in. \nEXT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY \nVICTORIA sits on a horse and trap.  BROWN steps out and helps her down. \nBROWN They're ready now. \nVICTORIA I hope they didn't go to any trouble, John. \nBROWN Ah, well... \nINT. ESTATE COTTAGE, BALMORAL - DAY \nVICTORIA steps in to be greeted by all four GRANTS in one military row, smoke still steaming off the fire.  BROWN stands behind her, barely able to contain himself.  But for VICTORIA, it is all she's ever known and so she takes it as perfectly normal. \nVICTORIA Mr Grant.  How good it is to see you. \nMR GRANT (bowing deeply) Your Majesty. \nVICTORIA Mrs Grant.  How is your knee?  Has the pain eased a little? \nMRS GRANT (bobbing in terror) Oh not so bad, ma'am. \nVICTORIA Good.  Oh and here are Douglas and John.  Haven't you grown? \nMRS GRANT (still bobbing away) Growing all the time, ma'am. \nMR GRANT remembers himself and gestures VICTORIA towards a chair. \nMR GRANT Will you sit, ma'am? \nFrom his place by the wall, BROWN notices how easily she smiles as she is led to the chair.  She points to a picture on the wall and her good humour is infectious. \nVICTORIA I know that!  That's Cairn Lochan.  We picnicked there once, did we not, John? \nINT. A SOCIETY PARTY, LONDON - DAY \n", "test1_id": 1761, "test2_input": "BROWN Well, don't stand where you shouldn't! \nThe UNDER-PORTER scrambles up the stairs.  A few SERVANTS exchange looks.  BROWN seems more determined than ever to exert his control. \nEXT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT \nThat night. \nCarrying an old storm lamp high over his head, BROWN walks towards the stables. \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY \nThe next day. \nBROWN is on horseback, riding with VICTORIA through the grounds.  He is still jumpy, eyes flicking left and right, searching for intruders.  They are being followed at a distance by two EQUERRIES on horseback.  VICTORIA frowns peevishly. \nVICTORIA Must they always follow us? \nBROWN I ordered it.  It's for your own safety. \nVICTORIA Dear me, you'll be telling me to watch what I eat next. \nBROWN doesn't react.  A beat. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) Am I not safe enough with you, John? \nBROWN Aye. (looking away) But there are Fenians reported on the mainland. \nVICTORIA (tutting irritably) The threat from the Irish is greatly exaggerated, I'm sure. \nBROWN (snapping back) I'll decide when it's exaggerated. \nBROWN chucks his horse on, bringing a firm halt to the conversation.  A beat.  He pulls up suddenly, staring at the shadows in the copse. \nVICTORIA Is anything the matter, John? (beat) John? \nHe stares for along moment and then lets it go. \nBROWN Nothing's the matter. \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, STABLES - NIGHT \nBROWN marches down the line of horse boxes.  A stable-lad, BARNEY, is feeding the horses.  He looks twitchy. \nBROWN Hey, Barney. \nBARNEY Mr Brown, sir -- \nBROWN It's cold out there tonight, Barney. \nReaching his pony, BROWN stops and smiles.  The animal lifts its face to him and he softly strokes his muzzle. \nBROWN (CONT'D) Yeah, there's a good girl. (to Barney) Have you had a look at this hoof?  She was limping badly.  I think there might be a stone in it. \nBARNEY Yeah, yeah, I did. \nBROWN Good man.  And is she all right? \nBARNEY Yeah. \nBROWN Good.  She's a good girl.  Aren't you? Yeah, she's a lovely girl.  And you know the Queen's riding tomorrow? \n", "test2_true": "BROWN (beat) Are you all right, Barney? \nBARNEY twitches again and BROWN realizes too late.  The split-second he turns, he sees THREE MEN. \nBROWN (CONT'D) Oh, aye... \nThe MEN pile onto him and he collapses under their weight. \nAs he falls, BROWN manages to yank himself round, bang up a fist and fling the others off him.  But the FIRST MAN is up again, twisting an arm round his neck and tugging him back. The others grapple his arms down, but BROWN is incredibly strong.  Even now, grunting and scrabbling, he makes them fight to force him back.  BARNEY stands transfixed in horror. \nDumping BROWN against the wall, the men step back and start kicking the shit out of him.  BROWN curls into a ball, jaw locked, hands over his head.  Not a sound. \nFinally, they back off, panting hard.  The FIRST MAN pulls out a bottle of whiskey, yanks back BROWN's head and forces whiskey down his throat.  It spills over his face and dribbles down his neck. \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY \nThe next day. \nVICTORIA is standing at the windows.  The door opens and LADY ELY walks in. \nVICTORIA Well? \nLADY ELY Mr Brown is unable to attend today. \nVICTORIA Why? \nLADY ELY I believe he is unwell, ma'am. \nVICTORIA Unwell? \nLADY ELY I understand he was in a fight. \nVICTORIA Has he been hurt? \nLADY ELY I believe not, ma'am.  I understand -- he'd had rather too much to drink. \nVICTORIA walks away and steps behind her desk. \nVICTORIA You may go. \nLADY ELY bows and walks out.  VICTORIA stares at the desk a moment, then picks up her pen and tries to work.  She cannot. \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, BROWN'S QUARTERS - DAY \nBROWN sits on the edge of the bed in only his undergarments.  His face, arms, legs and fingers are livid with bruises, but he sits there, stiff-backed and gritting his teeth, while ARCHIE crouches in front of him, tending to his wounds. \nBROWN And she sent no word down? \nARCHIE They said you were drunk. (beat) Why don't you tell her the truth? \nBROWN She'll think it's her fault for keeping me. \nARCHIE completes one of the dressings when BROWN suddenly reaches back and starts trying to put on his shirt. \nARCHIE What are you doing?! \nBROWN I'm getting dressed. \nARCHIE You've got three broken ribs, man! \n", "test2_id": 1762, "test3_input": "BROWN I've got my duties to attend to. \nARCHIE Don't be an idiot!  You're in no fit state to go anywhere. \nBROWN She'll be worried about me. \nARCHIE She'll get over it. \nBROWN I can't let her down now, Archie. \nARCHIE And when was the last time she put herself out for you?  Look, John, whatever she says to you now, in the end you're still a servant. \nBROWN Oh, I'm much more than that. \nARCHIE Aye, she may say that to you, but the woman can say what she wants. \nBROWN You watch your tongue. \nARCHIE Come on, man, I'm telling you what you already know. \nBROWN You know nothing about her! \nARCHIE When are you gonna see it, John?  She doesn't give a damn about you. \nBROWN lunges for the bedside drawer and pulls out a card showing a coy picture of a pretty woman.  He holds it up, eyes blazing. \nBROWN From the Queen! \nHe reads out the inscription. \nBROWN (CONT'D) My lips may give a message better of Christmas love than e'en this letter. (beat) To my best friend, J.B. from his best friend, V.R. (he thrusts it in his brother's face) Best friend! \nARCHIE Aye. \nBROWN She means it. \nARCHIE stares at him. \nARCHIE She'll drop you.  When she's done with you, she'll drop you. \nBROWN Get out. (beat) Out! \nARCHIE steps back but BROWN roars at him. \nBROWN (CONT'D) OUT!! \nARCHIE steps outside and BROWN is left alone. \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY \nThe next day.  VICTORIA sits at her desk.  PONSONBY hands her letters to sign. \nPONSONBY ... to be followed by a visit from Lady Bridport.  She is keen to secure a place for her niece as Maid of Honor. \nVICTORIA signs the last letter and sits back. \nVICTORIA I am tired. \nPONSONBY coughs. \nPONSONBY There is one other matter. \n", "test3_true": "PONSONBY I have a letter, ma'am. \nVICTORIA From whom? \nPONSONBY From Princess Helena and other members of your family. \nVICTORIA (stiffening defensively) My family is quite capable of communicating with the Queen in person. \nPONSONBY does not reply.  Finally, VICTORIA is obliged to ask. \nVICTORIA (CONT'D) What do they want? \nPONSONBY They are demanding the dismissal of John Brown on grounds of drunkeness. \nVICTORIA stares through the window, expressionless. \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY \nVICTORIA walks through the ornate chapel, nervously fingering her handkerchief.  Waiting for her, smiling softly, is the Dean of Windsor, DEAN WELLSELLY. \nDEAN WELLSELLY You wished to see me, ma'am? \nShe holds his eyes for a moment, then nods. \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, CHAPEL - DAY \nA few minutes later, VICTORIA and DEAN WELLSELLY are seated in a corner of the chapel, talking softly.  She cannot bring herself to look at him and so does not notice how carefully he is watching her throughout the interview. This is incredibly hard for her to say, but she struggles to be as honest as possible. \nVICTORIA My husband tried always to make me think more subtly.  Of course he taught me so much and I can never repay my debt to him, or the love I feel, even now.  But, in truth, I think I am someone who can only feel things while they are alive to me. For that reason, I know I do not have a subtle mind.  I know that.  But I work hard and I try to do my duty. (she hesitates; she is struggling now) However, I have noticed of late that my feelings of grief are not so strong and -- that I find myself leaning more upon the comfort of living friends. (beat) Friends close to me now. \nShe stops herself.  She is crying.  DEAN WELLSELLY watches her a moment, then speaks close, choosing his words carefully. \nDEAN WELLSELLY Your Majesty, a settled resignation is more lasting proof of affection than active grief.  If the good Lord sees fit to bring one into contact with congenial fellow beings, one should not analyze one's reaction too deeply. To allow oneself to be comforted by someone else need not imply any disloyalty to the memory of the loved one. \nSilence.  VICTORIA stares into the long, dark chapel. Gradually, as she takes in the tone of his remarks, her disappointment turns to anger. \nINT. WINDSOR CASTLE, QUEEN'S SITTING ROOM - DAY \nThe next day, VICTORIA stands at the far window and her back to the room.  Lined up against the wall are BERTIE and his siblings. \nVICTORIA Sir Henry. \nPONSONBY steps forward. \nPONSONBY Ma'am? \nVICTORIA Please tell the Princess, and other signatories to this letter, that the Queen will not be dictated to, or made to alter, in any way, what she has found to answer for her comfort. (beat) Do I make myself clear? \nPONSONBY Ma'am. \nA beat. \nVICTORIA You may go. \nThey all file out. \nEXT. THE GROUNDS OF WINDSOR CASTLE - DAY \nA few days later. \n", "test3_id": 1763}

He pours himself a drink. Carol shuts the cabinet. 
NICK I know what's going to happen. 
Nick opens a cabinet under the sink and tosses the empty bottle in the trash. He begins to pace. Carol shuts the cabinet and follows him with her gaze. 
As Nick speaks, he gestures grandly with his drink, liquor splashing unnoticed over the sides. 
NICK (bursting with frustration) The same job, same scenery, same people... I've been in this town for years... Years!! 
CAROL (flatly) Three years. 
NICK (in despair) Oh, Carol... 
CAROL I know... 
He stops and slugs back his drink. 
NICK Forever -- it seems forever. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BETH'S PINTO - CONTINUOUS 
Beth pulls up to a stoplight, her face blank with thought. She's suddenly lit by the flash of headlights going on and off. She looks up and smiles. 
EXT. INTERSECTION - CONTINUOUS 
Sid's pick-up truck is facing her across the intersection. It slowly pulls up beside her and stops. 
He smiles and gives a little wave of his hand. 
Without knowing why, she smiles and waves back. 
BETH (sweetly but firmly) Good-bye. 
She drives away. Sid stares after her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAROL'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Carol lifts the end metal ball on the thingabobby and releases it, starting the chain reaction. She stares at it clacking back and forth as she speaks. 
CAROL How long a drive is it? 
Nick paces. 
NICK Fourteen hours. 
CAROL That's not bad. 
NICK In a car? It's a fuckin' nightmare. 
Carol stops the metal ball. She releases two balls, starting a new chain reaction. 
NICK (griping) And there's no radio in Utah. It's all religious programs. 
CAROL Get saved. 
Nick slumps on the sofa beside her. 
NICK (flatly) No thanks. 
CAROL Hey. Think about this. You take a detour and go through Vegas -- you and Beth stop, see a show, have a nice romantic dinner -- play the slots, get the free drinks... 
NICK (interrupting) Too much money. The show. The meal. The slots. Then the hotel -- that's another hundred down the toilet. 
As Carol speaks she pokes at Nick. He fends off her blows. By the end of her speech she is on top of him mock-strangling him. 
CAROL (jabbing Nick) No, you skip the hotel. It's night, the highway's empty -- you can make good time. You start speeding. You get stopped in Utah by the cops -- you flunk the breathalizer, they haul you in. The judge is Mormon -- you get fifteen years, you go to prison, but at least your life has taken a direction! 
Nick and Carol collapse into laughter. The front door opens. 
BETH (calling in) I'm here! 
Beth steps in. Carol quickly lets go of Nick's neck and gets off him. 
NICK AND CAROL

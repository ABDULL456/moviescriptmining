AMY It's him.! 
In an instant, Amy is tearing down the platform, heading for the stairs that connect to the platform on the other side. 
COP Hey... 
Amy is watching, staring through the moving train windows. The figures are still there. Winter is staring at her - 
COP Hey, stop! Tomislav! Tomislav! 
n the next instant, the Cop is giving chase, and another Cop, clearly, the "Tomislav" called by the first Cop, further down the station, is rushing in to head Amy off. 
AMY It's them! Over there, over there! 
n the next instant, Tomislav tackles Amy and she goes down on her face. Even with the rather large Cop on top of her, she's still struggling. 
AMY God damn it, get off of me! Get the hell off of me... Get... 
She keeps struggling as the first Cop, and the others on the station, converge on her. She looks toward the far platform. 
The figure is still there, visible through the windows of the departing train. Then, the last car of the train passes, leaving an unencumbered view of the far side. 
The platform is empty. No sign of Winter. No sign of anybody. 
Amy stop struggling, as the Cops tug her arms back, handcuffing her. She hardly notices, but keep staring at the empty platform across the tracks. She glances up at the Cops. 
panting Tomislav looks down at her. Then circles his finger around his ear to his comrades. They all understand. 
TOMISLAV (IN ROMANIAN) She's Crazy. 
INT. POLICE INTERROGATION ROOM - DAY 
Amy sits slouched in a chair looking particularly pale. The door opens behind her. She hears a familiar voice. 
CHARLES (O.S.) Is this where they keep the cheaper whores? 
Amy glances up at him, without expression. 
CHARLES Christ, you're lucky to have a boss like me. Once again, I have saved your small but relatively shapely behind. 
AMY Least you got to travel. What were they going to charge me with, anyway? 
CHARLES Charge you? They were thinking of shipping you to the government asylum for observation -- and believe me if you go in there, you don't come out. But through my mastery of international negotiations I managed to convince them that you were merely irresponsible. You got your stuff? 
AMY Yeah. 
CHARLES Come on. 
Slowly, feeling her bruises, Amy gets up. 
EXT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS - DAY 
Charles and Amy walk and talk. It's pissing down rain. Charles hold an umbrella for the two to share. 
AMY Why'd you give me this story? 
CHARLES Who else would have taken it? Either they're going to think it's bull-shit, or they're going to be too afraid of it. But Amy Klein... Tell me it's real Amy. 
AMY It's real -- or I'm crazy.

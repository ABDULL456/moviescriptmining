Wedged into a tortured maze of hydraulics and equipment, we find the Chief, operating out of an air-pocket near the windscreen.  The pilot is dead, impaled on his cyclic stick, head submerged.  The co-pilot is still alive, barely.  The Chief struggles to keep the man's head up as he keys a survival radio. 
THE CHIEF Got one other heartbeat here, looks touch and go.  I've got a questionable leg. 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
THE CHIEF (V.O.) Managed to activate the ELB.  If you just radio base and let them know, they'll fix on that.  Oh, and make sure they send a helo with a winch -- door's blocked by a reef.  Over. 
JORDAN Chief, sir -- rescue team won't be here for 15 minutes.  What's your air situation?  Over. 
THE CHIEF (V.O.) Say again?  How many micks? 
JORDAN 15, sir. 
INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
The Chief sizes up his air pocket. 
THE CHIEF (into radio) That... may not be adequate. 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
FLEA If we could just fix on him... 
MCCOOL Beacon's a no-go for us. 
JORDAN (into radio) Chief -- did I see a flare box aboard?  And can you get at it? Over. 
EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
The Chief props up the co-pilot's head.  Gulps air.  Ducks underwater to grope through wreckage.  Only now do we see that "questionable leg" he was talking about:  It's snapped at mid-calf, blood rivering out. 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
THE CHIEF (V.O.) Got it. 
JORDAN (into radio) Show us where you are, Chief. 
EXT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
Again the Chief goes below water.  He finds a small breach in the fuselage... sticks the flare launcher through... and pulls the trigger. 
With a MAGNESIUM FLASH, the flare launches... 
EXT.  UNDERWATER - DAY 
... streaks toward the surface... 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
... and arcs into daylight 50 yards behind the ILB. 
FLEA Six o'clock!  Marking, marking! 
JORDAN Spotted you, Chief.  Pri One is to slip you some air, so we're coming down with a tank -- just something until the A-team shows.  Over. 
An ominous beat. 
JORDAN Chief? 
CHIEF (V.O.) O'Neil... there's no air in your main tanks. 
MCCOOL What? 
They scramble to check their main dive tanks.  Even through the gauges show full, they're dead empty.  All of them. 
INT.  CRASHED HELO - UNDERWATER - DAY 
THE CHIEF (into radio) This mission wasn't about tagging mines.  It was to see how you coped with mechanical failures.  Pretty fuckin' ironic, huh? 
He laughs.  It's the bleakest laugh imaginable. 
EXT.  OCEAN - DAY 
SLUTNIK He's circlin' the drain, el-tee. 
Jordan surveys the equipment they do have aboard -- the stuff she can count on.  Mental turbos kicking in:

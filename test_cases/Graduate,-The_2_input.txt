In the door to the lobby in the b.g. is Mrs. Robinson. She pauses, looks into the room, sees Ben and starts toward him.  Ben is looking out the window.  He does not see her approach. 
MRS. ROBINSON Hello, Benjamin. 
BEN Oh.  Hello.  Hello. 
He rises quickly. 
MRS. ROBINSON May I sit down? 
BEN Of course. 
He pulls out a chair, for her. 
MRS. ROBINSON Thank you. 
They sit down. 
MRS. ROBINSON How are you? 
BEN Very well.  Thank you. 
Ben tries to smile then looks out the window, then down at the center of the table. 
MRS. ROBINSON May I have a drink? 
BEN A drink?  Of course. 
Ben looks toward a passing WAITER and raises his hand. The waiter pays no attention.  Ben looks back at Mrs. Robinson apologetically. 
BEN He didn't see me. 
MRS. ROBINSON Waiter! 
For a moment, the noise in the room seems to recede.  The waiter stops in his tracks, turns toward them.  The waiter moves to their table.  The noise in the room comes back. The waiter looks at Mrs. Robinson. 
MRS. ROBINSON I will have a martini. 
WAITER No. 1 Yes, madam. 
The waiter moves away.  Ben watches him go. 
MRS. ROBINSON You don't have to be so nervous, you know. 
BEN Nervous.  Well, I am a bit nervous.  I mean it's - it's pretty hard to be suave when you're - 
He shakes his head. 
MRS. ROBINSON Did you get us a room? 
BEN What? 
MRS. ROBINSON Have you gotten us a room yet? 
BEN I haven't.  No. 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you want to? 
BEN Well - I don't.  I mean I could. Or we could just talk. 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you want me to get it? 
BEN You?  Oh no.  No.  I'll get it. 
MRS. ROBINSON Do you want to get it now? 
BEN Now? 
MRS. ROBINSON Yes. 
BEN Well - I don't know. 
MRS. ROBINSON Why don't you get it. 
BEN Why don't I get it?  Well - I will then. (he stands up) If you'll excuse me. 
Ben walks out of the Veranda Room and into the lobby.

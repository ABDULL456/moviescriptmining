MAX (CONT'D) Watching it quickly became about the only thing I could count on to go right. 
7 INT. JEN'S ROOM 足 FLASHBACK 足 NIGHT 7 
Max is with five friends in the double, and they all have lingering style-baggage from high school (eg. bad haircuts). 
MAX (TO CAMERA) It was freshmen year when we started watching Annie Hall as a tradition. (LOOKING AROUND) Jeez, this must have been the very first time. What's Amy doing here? I'm pretty sure Amy wasn't here. 
AMY is attractive, bookish, and sitting on Max's bed. CHARLES, a skinny guy in a large chair, tries to get her attention by wiggling his eyebrows seductively. 
Max puts the tape in the VCR, hits rewind, and moves to sit on his bed. He pauses when he sees how close he'll come to Amy. Finally, he climbs over her and awkwardly sits at the far end. 
Amy watches, rolls her eyes, and looks at BETH, who shakes her head sadly. Beth is pretty in an earthy way, spunky and sad at the same time. She looks sympathetically at Max, who is trying not to act nervous (and failing). 
The couple is SAM, who's short and charismatic, with a cool, slightly punkish personal style; and JEN, same height, cute and serious, conservative dress. They lie on the floor together. 
MAX (CONT'D) (TO CAMERA) That's Sam and Jen. Sam was the alpha- male of our group, which tends to consist mostly of zeta-males. He had been going out with Jen a couple weeks and we were all waiting to see if she would change him... 
Sam slides a pillow under her. 
SAM Are you comfortable, honey? 
JEN I'm fine, Sam. I was worried about you. Sure you don't want me to move over? 
SAM Oh no, no, Jen, if you're happy, I'm happy. 
Max and Charles exchange a look-- there they go again. Max makes a show of putting a pillow under a large Darth Vader doll. Beth laughs, Amy is amused. Sam looks back and is embarrassed. Jen rolls her eyes and gives Sam a look. 
JEN Are we gonna watch this movie or what?

8 INT. JEN'S ROOM 足 FLASHBACK 足 LATER 8 
Annie Hall's credits roll. Sam snaps on the lights. 
SAM Wow, what a good movie. 
AMY Oh, that was so sad! Relationships don't have to be like that! (TO MAX) I can see why you like this so much. It reminded me of you. 
MAX Uh, thanks, I guess. Does that mean you liked it? 
Max and Amy stand and face each other as the lights fade to black around everyone else. 
AMY I didn't say I liked it, I said it reminded me of you. It reminded me of what I didn't like about you, the cynicism, the neurotic insecurity, and oh yeah, when you started calling me every day. All the reasons we were never more than friends. 
MAX Well, at least you're being honest. 
AMY Of course I'm being honest. This is a fantasy extrapolated from a flashback. How could I lie to you? 
MAX (TO CAMERA) I'm the only person I know who gets insulted in his own fantasies. 
Charles walks by, Amy takes his arm, and they disappear into the surrounding darkness, which DISSOLVES TO: 
9 INT. LIMBO RADIO - PRESENT 9 
and again Max is alone. 
MAX Anyway, Amy set the tone for the rest of college... 
10 INT. THEATER LOBBY -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK 10 
The movie is Annie Hall. The theater is emptying. Suddenly, ERICA bursts through the crowd. Erica is mad. Max follows behind her, placating. 
ERICA AND WHAT IS IT WITH JEWISH MEN AND THEIR PENIS ISSUES?! 
Max freezes in place. The entire crowd of students turns to look at him. He manages a weak smile and turns back to Erica, but she's gone, out the doors into the night. 
Max turns back to the crowd and shrugs, but the crowd turns away. Max suddenly sees someone: Beth, looking at him. He blushes, self-conscious, and hurries away. 
MAX (V.O.) And even when it went right, it didn't. 
11 INT. STACY'S ROOM -- NIGHT -- FLASHBACK 11 
Max and STACY stumble in, inebriated, laughing. 
MAX ...And then I, then I, after I called the pizza place, I called an ambulance, and timed them. 
STACY Who won?

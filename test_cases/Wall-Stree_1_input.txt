DARIEN Where is it? 
BUD Upper West Side. 
DARIEN (losing interest fast) Oh really. Home of the exposed brick wall and the (shudders) houseplant. 
BUD Oh it's just a rental. I'm moving to the East Side soon. I've got a couple of deals brewing with Gordon. (shifts uncomfortably with his pretension) but that's just conversation... what about real things? Like dinner. The two of us. Friday. Cafe. Santo Domingo. 
Bud waits, staring suddenly and deeply into her eyes. 
DARIEN What if I have a previous engagement? 
BUD Break it. 
DARIEN I guess this must be destiny alright. My first yuppie apartment and... (pats him on the cheek flirtatiously) my first yuppie. 
BUD (gives her a steely glare) You may call me a yuppie... It's Mister Yuppie to you. 
They both laugh. 
BUD (gets serious) So. See you Friday. 
DARIEN You really do believe in destiny? 
BUD Only if I want something bad enough. 
Her date, Mr. GQ, SAMMY RUSPOLI intersects with Kate. A cultivated European air. 
SAM ...there you go again, Darien, talking with strange men. 
KATE That's our Darien: elusive, reclusive, exclusive. (to Sam) You know Bud right? He works for Gordon... (Sam nodding, makes conversation, big smile) Sam's in banking. You staying for dinner Bud? 
BUD (hesitant, eyes Darien) No, I'm afraid I've got to get some work... 
Kate noticing the doorbell ringing. 
KATE ...excuse me. 
Sam muttering something in Darien's ear of an intimate nature. She glides away with him. 
DARIEN (to Bud) Call me next week, I'll give you an estimate... 
An ironic promise in her eyes... Bud ecstatic inside... looks over, goes to the foyer... 
INT. GEKKO ALCOVE - NIGHT (RAIN) 
SIR LARRY WILDMAN walks in, his country gentleman clothing somewhat softening his imposing figure but not the cultured rapacious eagle's face. With him a lawyer. 
KATE (strained) Larry, how have you been? Get you a drink? 
WILDMAN (slightly impatient) Oh fine. Travelling actually. Nothing thank you. Is... 
KATE Gordon?... He's right here. 
As Gordon intersects, casually tasting a spot of the dinner. 
GEKKO Larry! Excuse me "sir" Larry, great to see you again, you're looking good. (handshakes) 
WILDMAN Gordon... (sniffing the guests and furnishings in the room as if they were stale air) 
BUD (leaving, to Gordon) I guess I'll head back... GEKKO (spontaneously) Stick around... Larry, one of my "gang" -- Bud Fox. 
Pleasantries. Bud nervously shakes hands, sensing Wildman might recognize him from being tailed in the elevator. There indeed is a moment but Wildman's attention blurs as... 
GEKKO Shall we go upstairs? 
INT. GEKKO DEN - NIGHT (RAIN) 
Gordon enters a den lined with old books hunting prints;  he proudly picks up something from his gun collection. 
GEKKO Rarest pistol in the world, Larry, a .45 Luger. Only six were ever manufactured. 
WILDMAN Congratulations but rarer still is your interest in Anacott Steel. 
GEKKO The same interest as yours Larry. Money. I thought it'd be a good investment for my kid...

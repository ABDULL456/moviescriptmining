for a moment. He's located towards the back wall across the dance floor in a booth on a raised area in the semi-circular room. With him are too-young Korean girls and a heavyset Rapper. The view got blocked by an African-American and a Korean bodyguard in suits near the booth, facing out.

VINCENT SPOTS 
an outer perimeter of security. Bodyguards within the crowd, facing outward from the booth...looking for trouble before it gets to the row of booths and Peter Yip. 
MAX 
receives the glance from Vincent. He's gestured down the middle of the dance floor towards the rear. They work their way through the mass of bodies. Meanwhile, Vincent casually smiles at a girl and takes an oblique path, sliding along a convex side wall. Vincent's path brings Vincent up behind Bodyguard #1, who looks to the right as... 
BODYGUARD #1 
pounded in the kidney. His head is twisted around and torn back, dropping him to the floor amid the bodies and noise. Vincent's focus is already on BODYGUARD #2, as he kicks down with ferocious force, slamming Bodyguard #1 into unconsciousness... 
Bodyguard #2 intuits, turns. Vincent's foot slams his knee sideways, breaking it, Vincent's palm bounces the man's forehead back, his fist slams into his exposed neck, that fast. 
MAX 
buffeted by dancers, saw, backs away, as... 
BODYGUARD #3                                                       * 
saw the assault on #2. He grabs for Vincent...who breaks the grab, pulls Bodyguard #3's head and neck down towards him, slams his knee into his rib cage twice, breaking things, spins the man backwards, rips his head sideways and back, a centimeter from breaking, and holding it there with his left arm, Vincent's right hand is filled with the H+K as he moves towards Peter Yip.

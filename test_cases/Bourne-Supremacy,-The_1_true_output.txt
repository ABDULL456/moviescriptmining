BOURNE -- the gun -- right to Jarda's face -- 
BOURNE Try again. 
JARDA Shot dead in Paris.       Dead the night you walked out. 
BOURNE/PHONE Then who runs Treadstone? 
JARDA Nobody. They shut it down. We're the last two. It's over... (not finishing because--) 
-- he's falling! -- landing hard -- BOURNE just kicked the chair out from under him -- 
BOURNE You're lying. If it's over, why are they after me? 
JARDA I don't know. 
BOURNE Who sent you to Greece? 
JARDA A voice. A voice from the States. Someone new. 
BOURNE Pamela Landy? 
JARDA I don't know who that is. 
BOURNE What's going on in Berlin? 
JARDA I don't know! Why would I lie? 
Silence.   BOURNE pulls back.      Unsure. 
JARDA makes it to his feet. 
JARDA (CONT'D)                           * What the hell did you do? You must have really screwed up. 
BOURNE doesn't know.      He backs off. 
JARDA (CONT'D) She really d   id that? Told you not to kill me? (beat) I had a woma   n once. But after a while, what do you    talk about? I mean, for us. The work. Y    ou can't tell them who you are... 
BOURNE I did. 
JARDA hesitates. It's really like Bourne just told him how much he loved her. 
JARDA I thought you were here to kill me. 
Something in the way he said it.          Plus Jarda just glanced at his watch. 
BOURNE What did you do? 
JARDA shrugs, almost embarrassed. BOURNE looks across to the alarm pad Jarda hit on the way in. Voltage -- like a switch. 
BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D) You called it in? 
JARDA I'm sorry. 
BOURNE How long? How long do I have -- (stopping because--) 
THE PHONE JUST STARTED RINGING -- loud -- insistent -- 
BOURNE (cont'd) (CONT'D) How long? 
144   INT. DOD RAPID CAR -- DAY                                      144 
Jam   ming -- ri   ght the f   uck into it -- three guys -- JARHEADS --    DOD Specia   l Force d   udes -- speeding through MUNICH -- JAR    #1 is the    driver -   - JAR #2 is prepping weapons like a man   iac in the    backseat    and -- 
JAR #3 (on the phone) -- it's a red flag file! -- so fix it, call them back ASAP! -- 
JAR #1 (the call) What? What'd they do? 
JAR #3 (bad news) She called Munich local. 
JAR #2 (slamming home another clip) It's probably just a drill anyway.                         * 
145   INT. JARDA'S HOUSE KITCHEN -- DAY                                 145 
PHONE RINGING -- JARDA in cuffs -- BOURNE scanning out the windows -- everything fast -- 
BOURNE -- car keys? 
JARDA -- my coat -- but we should -- 
BOURNE -- what? -- 
JARDA -- take the back -- get another car -- 
BOURNE hesitates -- just a moment -- 
Wrong. 
SLAM! -- out of nowhere -- JARDA swings -- two-hands -- still cuffed -- like a mace -- catching BOURNE hard and -- 
BOURNE stunned -- JARDA smashing the coffee table, slices the flexcuffs through on a shard of glass -- Free! 
JARDA follows up -- knee up in the ribs -- THE GUN KNOCKED FREE FROM BOURNE'S HAND! -- skittering across the floor -- BOURNE -- as JARDA starts to move -- backhanding him and --

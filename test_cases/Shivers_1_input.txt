Betts and Janine are on the sofa, Janine with her head in Betts's lap, Betts rocking Janine like a child. 
JANINE (sobbing) Oh, Betts, Betts, everything is so hideous. Everything dies and rots and disappears. I'm going to die, and you're going to die, and Nick... 
She breaks down. 
Betts is drowsy-eyed and smiling. She strokes Janine's hair. 
BETTS There, there, there. It all gets sorted out in the genes and chromosomes. It's not for us to think about at all. It's not our problem at all, 'Nine. We're just here to exist and to have a good time. Exist and have a good time. (pause) Do I feel good, 'Nine? Do I feel good to you? 
Janine's eyes are red and she still sobs a bit as she speaks, but she is obviously feeling a bit soothed. 
JANINE Oh, you feel very good, Betts. You have such a cosy body. I'm jealous, I'm so skinny. 
BETTS (casually, as though it were the most ordinary request in the world) Make love to me, 'Nine? I want you to make love to me. Please, please make love to me. 
Janine twists around and looks up at Betts. There is something in Betts' tone -- quite apart from what she is saying -- that disturbs her, something that reminds her of her husband. 
JANINE Betts! You can't really be saying that! You just can't! 
Betts smiles drowsily. She bends over Janine, turning her head in her hands until they face each other. Betts lowers her face toward Janine. Janine is wide-eyed, almost hypnotized by Betts's strength, smile, and confidence. 
BETTS Let's not talk any more, 'Nine, shall we? Let's kiss and make up. Let's kiss... kiss and make up, shall we? 'Nine? 
Janine resists only slightly as Betts places her lips on Janine's. After a pause, Betts suddenly opens her mouth wide and presses her lips savagely against Janine's. 
She holds Janine's head firmly as they kiss. Janine struggles for a moment, then opens her mouth as well. 
Her eyes are closed in passion, then suddenly open wide in terror as Betts's throat swells like a goiter as a parasite rushes up her throat toward Janine's open mouth. The parasite begins to force its way into Janine's mouth and down her throat. Janine gags and tries to pull away, but too late. 
INT. INCINERATOR ROOM -- NIGHT 
Forsythe runs down the steps which lead to the incinerator and pulls open the steel door at the bottom. She begins to look around for St. Luc. 
FORSYTHE Roger? Roger, are you here? 
She suddenly stumbles across the body of the man St. Luc has killed. She actually has to break her fall with her hands, which slip in the man's blood. Horrified, she gets up and backs away. 
The sounds of people moaning and laughing are coming from everywhere. Forsythe finds herself up against a large door. She tugs on the handle and it opens. 
INT. MAIN DOORS -- NIGHT

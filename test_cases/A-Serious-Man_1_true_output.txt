LARRY Oh, they're very... He gropes. . resilient. 
DON Good. Well. On the other thing, the neighbor's property line, I've asked Solomon Schlutz to take a look. There's very little having to do with real estate that'll get by Sol. 
LARRY Okay. Good. How do you-I guess I'm a little worried, how do you, I have money pressures and- 
DON Our fee structure? We bill by the hour. Dave Sieglestein and Solomon Schlutz bill at a hundred and ten, the associ- ates, me for instance, bill at A secretary sticks her head in. 
SECRETARY A call for Mr. Gopnik. DANNY. At home. 
LARRY 
DANNY? ! 
DON You can take it here. 
SECRETARY Oh-eight-oh-nine. LARRY punches a button on a row of four on the conference-room telephone. 
LARRY 
DANNY? ! 
VOICE Dad? 
LARRY Are you all right? Are you all-is everything- 
VOICE F Troop is fuzzy. 
LARRY . What? 
VOICE F Troop is still fuzzy. LARRY stares. 
DON Everything okay? 
DAWN AT THE JOLLY ROGER Wide on the motel room, dimly lit by weak sun starting to seep in around the curtain. LARRY sleeps in one of the twin beds; Uncle Arthur snores in the other. Uncle Arthur's breath snags and tangles on a snorfling inhale and it wakes him, gagging. He blinks, sits up, swings his legs out, gazes blearily around the room. He rises stiffly and heads for the bathroom. LARRY stirs. The sound of Uncle Arthur urinating. LARRY looks blearily around. LARRY stiffly rises. He takes the two steps across the room to the formica desk on which are spread papers for his class. As we hear the sucking sound of the neck evacuator in the bathroom, LARRY sweeps papers together and mechanically stuffs his briefcase. 
CAR LARRY is driving, hollow-eyed, to work. After a long beat of staring, the ka-ching of a bicycle bell. 
LARRY's eyes widen and his head swivels, tracking as he overtakes and passes: The bicyclist. A young Asian man wearing a white traffic-mask. LARRY looks at him in the rear-view. 
LARRY 
CLIVE! He starts frantically pumping down his window, shouting: . CLIVE! You gonna send your mother next?! You little bastard! I wanna see you! I wanna- Crash. He has rear-ended someone. A blaring horn, a quick second crash: wrenching steel and spattering glass. He has been rear-ended in turn. The ka-ching of the bicycle. CLIVE Park cycles past without looking. 
BLEGEN HALL LARRY enters the outer office, hugging his paper-stuffed briefcase to his chest. The secretary is just crooking the phone into her shoulder. 
SECRETARY Oh-Professor Gopnik. It's Dick Dutton again.

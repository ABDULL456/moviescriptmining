(HE DOES) What do you do? 
PETER Mostly player evaluation right now. 
BILLY Why does Mark listen to you? 
PETER Actually he rarely does. 
BILLY He just did. 
PETER I don't think he was really listening to me in there per se. 
BILLY Really? 
PETER Yeah, I think he was listening to Bruce. 
BILLY Who are you? 
PETER Peter Brand. 
BILLY I don't give a rat's ass about your name. 
Nothing from Peter. 
BILLY What happened in there? 
PETER I'm not sure what you're asking me. 
BILLY What did you tell Butch? 
PETER Huh? Oh Bruce? I told him I like Garcia. 
BILLY 
(BEAT) Why? 
PETER 
(BEAT) Probably for the same reasons you do. 
BILLY Meaning what? 
PETER He's undervalued. You were smart to go after him. 
BILLY 
(LONG BEAT) What makes him undervalued? 
Peter is stuck. He can't bring himself to say anything. After a long beat Billy nods to him in a way that seems to say, `I understand, it's okay'. 
BILLY Come on. 
Billy makes a strong gesture indicating Peter to follow. Which he does. They exit the offices into 
20 INT. A VAST PARKING STRUCTURE - CONTINUOUS 20 
BILLY Where you from Peter? 
PETER Maryland. 
BILLY Where did you go to school? 
PETER Yale. 
BILLY I hate Yale. 
PETER Why? 
BILLY Kid from Yale once blocked a trade I was trying to make. What'd you study? 
PETER Economics. 
BILLY What are you doing in baseball? 
PETER I love baseball. 
BILLY I'm just curious. Why were you so cagey in there? 
PETER I work for a different team. 
BILLY I know, but I'm the first person in baseball who's ever talked to you this long. Right? Why is Garcia undervalued? 
PETER Okay, truthfully, it might not be so easy to explain. 
BILLY Really? Why's that Peter? 
PETER We might not see the game the same way. 
BILLY Oh really? What do you mean by that? 
PETER You've spent your life in baseball and I don't have a very traditional view of the game. 
BILLY Hey Pete, just say it. I'm not about to beat you up. Say what you've always wanted to say to a GM. 
PETER Baseball thinking is medieval. It's stuck in the Dark Ages. I have a more scientific view of the game. 
BILLY Keep going, Peter. 
PETER There is an epidemic failure within the game to understand what's really happening. And it leads people who run major league teams to misjudge their players and mismanage their teams. They're still asking the wrong questions. People who run baseball teams still think in terms of buying players. Sorry to say that. 
BILLY Peter, don't apologize for what you believe. 
PETER The goal shouldn't be to buy players, what you want to buy is wins. To buy wins, you buy runs. You're trying to replace Johnny Damon. The Red Sox look at Johnny Damon and they see a star worth seven point five million a year. When I look at Johnny Damon, I see an imperfect understanding of where runs come from. 
SUDDEN CUT TO: 
ARCHIVAL VIDEO: The back of Johnny Damon's A's jersey as he walks to the plate to adoring Oakland fans. 
PETER V/O His batting average is ignorable. What matters is his on base percentage- 
DAMON swings at the first pitch and knocks it into left field for a single. He leads off first-- 
PETER V/O - which in 2001 was .324. That's 10 points lower than league average, and 17 points lower than Garcia's. 
On the next pitch, DAMON takes off for second-- 
PETER V/O True, he stole some bases. But attempted steals in general have to succeed 70% of the time before they even start to contribute to run totals. In 2001 he cost you runs. DAMON's tagged out at second. 
BACK TO THE GARAGE 
PETER He's got a good glove. He's a decent leadoff hitter. He steals bases. But he's not worth the seven point five million Boston is paying him. You're lucky to have him off your payroll, it opens all kinds of interesting possibilities. 
BILLY You read Bill James, Pete? 
PETER Yes. These ideas and this approach to the game aren't all new. In fact, some of them have been around for two decades. 
BILLY If this approach has been around for so long, why isn't anybody in baseball doing them? 
PETER That's a much more difficult question than how to win baseball games. Once you begin to pull at that string, your understanding of the world might begin to unravel.

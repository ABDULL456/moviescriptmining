23   EXT TATOOINE SEA - SKIFF 
Jabba's huge SAIL BARGE moves above the desert surface accompanied by two smaller Skiffs. One of the skiffs glides close, revealing Luke, Han, and Chewie -- all in bonds -- surrounded by guards, one of whom is Lando in disguise. 
HAN I think my eyes are getting better. Instead of a big dark blur, I see a big light blur. 
LUKE There's nothing to see. I used to live here, you know. 
HAN You're gonna die here, you know. Convenient. 
LUKE Just stick close to Chewie and Lando. I've taken care of everything. 
HAN Oh... great! 
24   INT BARGE OBSERVATION DECK 
Jabba the Hutt rides like a sultan in the massive antigravity ship. His entire retinue is with him, drinking, eating, and having a good time. Leia is watching her friends in the skiff when the chain attached to her neck is pulled tight and Jabba tugs the scantily clad princess to him. 
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled) Soon you will learn to appreciate me. 
Threepio wanders among the Sail Barge aliens, bumping into a smaller droid serving drinks, spilling them all over the place. The stubby droid lets out an angry series of beeps and whistles. 
THREEPIO Oh, I'm terribly sor... Artoo! What are you doing here? 
Artoo beeps a quick reply. 
THREEPIO Well, I can see you're serving drinks, but this place is dangerous. They're going to execute Master Luke and, if we're not careful, us too! 
Artoo whistles a singsong response. 
THREEPIO Hmm.  I wish I had your confidence. 
25   EXT SARLACC PIT 
The convoy moves up over a huge sand pit. The Sail Barge stops to one side of the depression, as does the escort skiff. But the prisoner's skiff moves out directly over the center and hovers. At the bottom of the deep cone of sand is a repulsive, mucous-lined hole, surrounded by thousands of needle-sharp teeth. This is the SARLACC. A plank is extended from the edge of the prisoner's skiff. Guards release Luke's bonds and shove him out onto the plank above the Sarlacc's mouth. 
26   EXT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK 
Jabba and Leia are now by the rail, watching. Threepio leans forward and the slobbering villain mumbles something to him. As Threepio steps up to a comlink, Jabba raises his arm and the motley array of intergalactic pirates fall silent. Threepio's voice is amplified across loudspeakers. 
THREEPIO Victims of the almighty Sarlacc: His Excellency hopes that you will die honorably. But should any of you wish to beg for mercy, the great Jabba the Hutt will now listen to your pleas. 
27   EXT SKIFF 
Han steps forward arrogantly and begins to speak. 
HAN Threepio, you tell that slimy piece of... worm-ridden filth he'll get no such pleasure from us. Right? 
Chewie growls his agreement. 
LUKE Jabba! This is your last chance. Free us or die. 
Lando moves unobtrusively along the skiff as Luke shoots a quick look of conspiracy to him. 
28   INT SAIL BARGE OBSERVATION DECK 
The assembled monsters rock with mocking laughter as Artoo zips unnoticed up the ramp to the upper deck. Jabba's laughter subsides as he speaks into the comlink. 
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled) Move him into position. 
Jabba makes a thumbs-down gesture. Leia looks worried. 
29   EXT BARGE - UPPER DECK 
Artoo appears from below and zips over to the rail facing the pit. Below, in the skiff, Luke is prodded by a guard to the edge of the plank over the gaping Sarlacc. Luke looks up at Artoo, then gives a jaunty salute: the signal the little droid has been waiting for. A flap opens in Artoo's domed head. 
JABBA	 (in Huttese subtitled) Put him in.

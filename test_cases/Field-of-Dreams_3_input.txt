KARIN What's suspend? 
RAY They never let him play the game again. They continue to work in silence. 
CUT TO 
37 INT. SPORTING GOODS STORE I 7 
Ray writes a check for his purchases: bats, balls, bases pitcher's rubber, home plate, etc. He appears slightly annoyed that once again, he is being stared at by all the uniformed employees of the store. He turns to catch the Store Owner staring at him the most intently. 
RAY What. What! 
STORE OWNER You're the fella that plowed under your corn and built a baseball diamond, right? 
RAY Yeah. What about it? 
STORE OWNER (shakes his hand) Greatest damn thing I ever heard. The other employees beam their agreement. 
RAY At these prices, I'm not surprised.

37 CONTINUED He wheels his shopping cart of sporting goods out through a gauntlet of approving salesmen. They smile and pat him on the back. Ray cannot decide if they're crazier than he is. 
RAY Thank you...thank you... 
CUT TO 
38 THE LIGHT STANDARD - NIGHT 38 Atop the aluminum-painted poles, an array of store-bought floodlights switch on, flaring against the blue-black sky. In this sharp white light the grass glows parrot green, cool as mint, soft as a cashmere blanket. Annie and Karin watch as Ray puts down the clean white bases, which pick up the light like little moons on a cold, clear night. 
RAY My father said he saw him years later playing under a made-up name in some tenth-rate league in Carolina. He'd put on fifty pounds, and the spring was gone from his step, but he could still hit. Dad used to say no one could hit like Shoeless Joe. Ray is smiling wistfully. 
ANNIE That's the first time I've ever seen you smile as you mentioned your father. Ray considers that. 
KARIN How come? 
ANNIE Come on, you. Bed time. Annie hoists Karin on her shoulders with a grunt, and the three climb their way down the bleachers. Ray's hand steadies Annie as she takes one of the steps. 
RAY Careful... Moonl ight butters the Iowa night. They walk along the side of the field, and Ray stops. He looks at the field.

38 CONTINUED 38 
RAY I have just created something totally illogical. 
ANNIE That's what I like about it. 
RAY Am I completely nuts? 
ANNIE Not completely. She looks out over the baseball field. 
ANNIE It's a good baseball field, Ray. 
RAY It is kinda pretty, isn't it? Annie smiles at him and carries Karin inside. Ray steps onto the porch and flicks the switch shutting off the floodlights over the field. 
CUT TO 
39 RAY AND ANNIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 39 Annie opens her eyes and sees Ray not beside her in bed, but in th window seat, looking out at the empty field. Barely awake, she gets out of bed, shuffles to his side and curls up against him. 
ANNIE Any sign? 
RAY Something's going to happen out there. I can feel it. Annie lowers her head against his chest and goes back to sleep. Outside, the trees are fully leafed. 
DISSOLVE TO 
40 RAY'S BASEBALL FIELD - OCTOBER 40 The trees are almost bare now, and there's a Halloween pumpkin in the front window of the house. The cornstalks

,rustle like crumpling paper in the Indian-summer breeze which blows fallen leaves across the empty baseball field while Ray sits in the stands... waiting. 
DISSOLVE TO 
41 THE BASEBALL FIELD - LATE DECEMBER 41 it is covered with snow. 
42 INT. RAY AND ANNIE'S HOUSE 42 
Ray looks forlornly out the living room window towards his snow-covered baseball field, the merrily blinking lights of the Christmas tree behind him belying his true mood.

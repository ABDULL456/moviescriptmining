SGT. NANTZ That's right. This fight's not over. 
CPL. CORREGGIO Sergeant's gonna get us killed! Just like my brother. A beat. Nantz eyes Correggio. It's laid open now. 
SGT. NANTZ Believe me, Correggio, I grieved for every marine I ever lost... Nantz looks around now, from marine to marine. 
SGT. NANTZ But we are in the fight of our lives right now. And our duty is to keep moving forward. Keep fighting. That's how we honor men like your brother, Correggio. And Lt. Martinez. And Hector's father, who saved Adukwu's life. He wasn't trained for that. He just picked up a rifle and did what needed to be done. If a civilian can do that... 
(MORE) 
SGT. NANTZ (cont'd) Well then I better square my shit away and do whatever I have to do to defeat this enemy. But I can't do it alone. Nantz stares. The tension is palpable. 
SGT. NANTZ I need you men. And maybe we'll die fighting today. Not because we're heroes. But because we're goddamn United States marines, and always will be. 
(BEAT) I'm willing to give my full measure for you. I'm hoping you'll do the same for me. A BEAT, glances exchanged. THEN ALL THE MARINES RISE AS ONE. 
CPL. STAVROU Sergeant. We'll follow you to hell and back. Nantz smiles, nods. 
SGT. NANTZ Good. 'Cause that's where we're going. 
EXT. STREET - MOMENTS LATER 
The squad is moving in unison, covering all around, approaching the LAV. They jump in. 
INT. LAV - CONTINUOUS 
Stavrou fires it up, drives off as... Nantz eyes the jumble of gear. He grabs his COMBAT SHOTGUN, a portable RADIO, which he makes sure is OFF... Then an olive case marked: GLTD. He stuffs it in his pack. 
PVT. IMLAY Laser target, sir? 
SGT. NANTZ Might have to get some cruise missiles in here. 
PVT. IMLAY Shit, yes, Sergeant. 
CPL. STAVROU 
(CALLING OUT) Hostiles. Twelve o'clock. Nantz looks up to see... ALIEN SOLDIERS appearing on the street now. Nantz goes back to stuffing his pack. 
SGT. NANTZ Just hit the gas, Corporal. We got plenty of armor. Everyone looks up at this. Then looks out to see... The aliens attacking, FIRING on the LAV as... Stavrou floors it, ALIEN FIRE pinging off the LAV's armor as... SPLAT!!! 
STAVROU MOWS THROUGH THE ENEMY LINE. Nantz looks out the back to see some ALIENS STAGGERING AWAY. 
SGT. NANTZ Reverse, Corporal. 
CPL. STAVROU Aye, aye, Sergeant. As he BACKS UP, mowing back over the remaining aliens... The marines cheer. 
EXT. STREET - LATER 
The LAV cruises slowly. Nantz stares forward. The BLACK DEAD ZONE looms ahead... As they get closer, it seems like the whole area is absent of light. A black hole. Nantz stares out, about to answer when the LAV LURCHES, then lurches again. Stavrou REVS the engine. 
SGT. NANTZ What's going on?

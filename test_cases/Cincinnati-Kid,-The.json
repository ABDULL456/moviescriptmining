HOBAN'S POOL ROOM - HOBAN AND THE SHOOTER \nWe are in the front room where the pool tables are. Through an open door in b.g., we can see the unadvertised but unconcealed other activity of the establishment: a poker game in progress. \nHOBAN You going to tell The Kid, Shooter? \nSHOOTER Hell, I can't not tell him. \nHOBAN It's where he's been headed for years. \nThe Kid enters the place through the front door, still a little dishevelled from his escape. \nKID (in greeting) Hey! \nHOBAN What you say, Kid? \nKID Hey, Hoban. \nSHOOTER Where you been? Boys been holding a chair for you in back. \nKID Business opportunity come along. Something too good to pass up. \nSHOOTER Turn a profit? \nKID Yeah, did okay. Except I almost had it took back. \nHOBAN Oh, one of those. \nSHOOTER (concerned) You been in too many rough ones lately, Kid. You can't go on forever, coming out in one piece. \nKID I got to build my stake, Aren't enough chances in this town to let one go. \nHOBAN You're too good, that's your trouble. People who know you're the Cincinnati Kid, they don't want to sit down with you -- \nKID For nickels and dimes... Thing is I've about used up St. Louis. \nSHOOTER (nodding) The streets are getting full of guys you've hustled. \nKID Been thinking about Miami. There's nothing to keep me here. \nSHOOTER (after a moment) The hell there isn't (as the Kid looks at him) Lancey Hodges' in town. \nKID Yeah? (then) The Man himself, here in St. Louis -- I might just stick around Shooter. \nINT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM \nLancey is on the phone, sitting on the bed. \nLANCEY (into phone) Mr. Schlaegel?

My diet these days is enough to spoil anyone else's appetite... A pleasure, sir. Please remember me to your charming wife. \nHe hangs up and some of the strength seems to go out of him, as if he had been through too long a sustained effort. His eyes show that he is feeling pain and he breathes deeply. \nEXT. HAROLD STREET - DAY \nHarold Street leads to the river and we follow The Kid and The Shooter as they walk down it in the gathering dusk. \nSHOOTER (lighting a cigar) I been seeing it coming for a long time, Kid. Long time. \nKID I ain't exactly been hiding it. \nSHOOTER No, you ain't been hiding it. \nKID Well I got to know. \nSHOOTER Sure, you got to know. We all got to know. \nKID Sometime or other we got to find out how much juice we got. \nSHOOTER That's why I had to tell you. \n", "test1_true": "SHOOTER Yes, I have. \nThey walk along, The Shooter pursing his lips thoughtfully. \nKID Well, what happened? \nSHOOTER Nothing. Nothing at all. \nKID You lost. \nSHOOTER I didn't lose. I'm too good to lose when I set my mind to it. I play poker a certain way, Kid. I've had my Lancey Hodges. Only with me it was Whistling Sam Magee to New Orleans. \nKID (respectfully) I heard about him. \nSHOOTER Well then you know it all... about 20 years ago it was, maybe more. \nKID What happened? \nSHOOTER Why, I lost it. It dried me up on the inside for a long, a very long time. \nKID Yeah? \nSHOOTER I been where I'm going, know what I mean? \nThe Kid nods as they come to where an old wooden pier extends into the river. Along the river bank can be seen a small portion of the mile-long Hooverville that stretches up and down the Mississippi. \nEXT. PIER \nThey walk out on the pier and eventually stop, look out at the river, watching the working boats. They have their thoughts; The Shooter smoking his cigar. \nKID You think I'm ready? \nSHOOTER (after some time, several seconds of thoughtful puffing) Kid, I don't think you're ready. \nKID (quickly) Oh. \nSHOOTER But you're not going to take my word for it, are you? Are you now? \nKID No, I ain't. I can't. \nSHOOTER I know, I know. You got to find out for yourself. \nKID I don't figure to take him right away. But if I can hang in there long enough, I can outlast him. If I can outlast him, I got a chance. You admit that, don't you, that I got a chance? \nSHOOTER I already said I didn't think you were ready. \nKID Did you think you were ready when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee? \nSHOOTER Kid, I thought I was the best stud poker player in the world. I'm telling you now, I thought I was the best. \nKID Well, I don't think I'm just a cocky square with a fair hand with cards. I got something. \nSHOOTER No, you ain't no cocky square. And you probably got something. \nKID Okay. And I ain't saying that you was either when you sat down with Whistling Sam Magee. \nSHOOTER If you got the stuff, being a little cocky don't hurt you none. \nKID Well, would you say if I got any chance at all? \nSHOOTER This much of a chance. If Lancey is not right. If he's got a cold, or his stomach ulcer is acting up, or something like that. \nKID But then everybody'd see he wasn't right and it wouldn't prove nothing. Listen, we got to have it understood. If he's not right, we call it off till he is. \nSHOOTER You're set on a real showdown, aren't you? Your mind's all made up. \nThey start back off the pier. \nKID I got to. You said yourself I got to. I'm overdue. \nSHOOTER Yeah, you been around a long time -- I was a lot younger than you when I went up against Whistling Sam -- But you'd be kinda young too, to be The Man. \nKID I gotta find out. \nSHOOTER (after a pause) Want me to set it up? \nKID (gratefully) I wish you would, Shooter Man. \nSHOOTER All right. \nKID Hey, what if he turns me down? \n", "test1_id": 2109, "test2_input": "CHRISTIAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Would you wear it in public? \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Christian and Melba looking at the display. \nMELBA Wouldn't be much point wearing it in private. Sure, why not, as long as you don't have a bulge to hide? \nThey start walking. \nCHRISTIAN I don't know, Melba. \nMELBA (looking her over) My guess is there isn't anything about you needs hiding. But I'll give you a more definitive opinion at the bath. \nCHRISTIAN (startled) At the what? \nMELBA Turkish Bath. After we're through shopping. I'm treating you, Christian. \nCHRISTIAN I never been. I'm not even sure what you do. \nMELBA You don't do anything. That's what's so marvelous. They do it to you. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT.

Never went back to the boarding house except to pick up my things. \nMELBA And that side of it's held up? No complaints in the bed department? \nCHRISTIAN Well, just one. \nMELBA (intrigued) Yes? \nCHRISTIAN The nights he isn't there. \nMELBA He really does that to you, does he? You got one of the rare ones. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. MASSAGE ROOM \nChristian and Melba are on adjoining rubbing tables, a curtain separating them from the waist down only. Their heads are close enough so they can talk without their masseurs necessarily hearing every word they say. \nCHRISTIAN You find a guy, you love him, and that's it. It's supposed to just go on like that for life. Right? \nMELBA According to the propaganda, right. \nCHRISTIAN But it isn't my life, it's his life, with me tacked on. You have any idea what it's like to be a hash slinger in a cheap restaurant? \nMELBA No, honey, the stock crash wafted me right from the daisy chain into unmarried bliss. \nCHRISTIAN It's hell, if you'll excuse the word. But I didn't want to quit. The Kid made me. I felt I ought to hang on to something that was me away from him. You know what I mean? \nMELBA Sure. Some girls solve the problem by taking on an extra guy. \nCHRISTIAN I'm serious. Having children might take care of it, I don't know. Or -- this is really a terrible thing to admit. \nMELBA Your most sordid secrets are safe with me. Confess. \nCHRISTIAN If he was rich, or famous -- \nMELBA Why don't you give him both? \nCHRISTIAN (smiling) Why not? Well, if he was rich and famous, maybe I wouldn't mind so much just being -- just a woman to him. Do you think that might make it seem more worthwhile somehow? \nMELBA Somehow! Are you sincere, sweetie? (reacting to the masseur's touch) Oooo -- divine. (to Christian) Isn't this heaven? \nCHRISTIAN I'm not sure. In a way it seems soft of -- \nShe is at a loss for a word. \nMELBA Decadent? Depraved? \nChristian looks blank. \nMELBA Wicked? \nCHRISTIAN Well, yes. \nMELBA That's what I meant by heaven. \n", "test2_true": "Lancey, Shooter and five other men are sitting in comfortably padded chairs around a well-appointed poker table. Everything about the game is in sharp contrast to the one The Kid played in. It is played with chips - expensive ones; there are a couple of bottles of wine on ice, fine cigars, a tray of sandwiches, etc. Lancey's opponents are all wealthy types; two of them could be Texas oil men. The youngest, a good- looking man of thirty, is BILL SCHLAEGEL. The Shooter, as nonplaying dealer, distributes fifth cards to the four remaining players in the hand, and both Lancey and Bill end up with four cards of one suit showing. \nSHOOTER (as he deals) Still queens -- possible flush -- no help -- possible flush. \nFIRST WEALTHY TYPE Queens check to the possibles. \nLANCEY Check. \nSECOND WEALTHY TYPE Check. \nBill silently tosses in two of the rarest and highest ranking chips on the table. \nFIRST WEALTHY TYPE Fold. \nLANCEY And up two. \nSECOND WEALTHY TYPE Fold. \nTHIRD WEALTHY TYPE Biggest pot yet. \nA phone RINGS and the Third Wealthy Type answers it. \nBILL Call the two thou. \nLANCEY (turning over queen of his suit) Queen high. \nBILL (indignantly) Jack high. Can you beat that? \nFIRST WEALTHY TYPE He just did. \nTHIRD WEALTHY TYPE (to Second Wealthy Type) It's your office. \nSECOND WEALTHY TYPE Dallas or Tulsa? \nTHIRD WEALTHY TYPE She just said office. \nThe Third Wealthy Type takes the phone and speaks on it during the ensuing. The Second Wealthy Type crosses to the bar and fixes himself a drink. Lancey takes in his winnings. Bill hasn't recovered from the blow. There is a hiatus in the game. \nBILL How the bloody hell did you figure out I didn't have the king or the ace? \nLANCEY I recollect a young fellow putting the same question to Eddie the Dude. It was a game in the grand lounge of the \"J.M. White, Third,\" the largest paddle-wheeler ever built. \"Son,\" Eddie told him, \"All you paid was the looking price. Lessons are extra.\" (turns to Shooter) First time I heard of this Cincinnati Kid was in New Orleans, at Yeller's. I knew right away I'd have to play him someday. \nSHOOTER You'll enjoy his game. \nLANCEY I may admire it. But if he's all that good, I doubt if I'll enjoy it. \nSHOOTER The tougher the competition, the better you used to like it. \nLANCEY I've learned to take everything in moderation. \nEXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nIt is early evening. The Kid approaches the restaurant with Christian on one arm, Melba on the other. \nKID (to Melba) Have a drink with us? \nMELBA Better not. Shooter said they'd break at seven, and he has to have his food first, then his nap. (looking The Kid over) You know, there's a day in your life I'm looking forward to. \nKID In my life? \nMELBA The day The Kid becomes The Man. \nShe smiles at them both and goes off. They move to enter the restaurant. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. RESTAURANT - KID AND CHRISTIAN \nThe plates with the remains of their main course are in front of them. The Kid pours what's left of a bottle of beer into his glass. \nCHRISTIAN How'd you sleep Kid? \nKID I slept okay. \nCHRISTIAN I hope you don't mind my not being there when you woke up. \nKID No I don't mind -- (then) What she was talking about, Shooter's woman -- I'm going up against a big game soon. \nCHRISTIAN She told me.

THE SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - MELBA \nMELBA (into phone) I'm not asking for him. \nINT. BUS TERMINAL - THE KID \nHe hangs up the phone, rather than continue the discussion. CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he comes out of the booth, picks up a small duffel bag, and walks to the door that leads to the busses. He goes out into the night and gets into a bus. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nEXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY \nA bus drives along a main road in the Ozarks, heading toward CAMERA. As it comes close, the name of its destination: \"FAYETTEVILLE\" can be read. \nEXT. CROSSROADS COMMUNITY - DAY \nThe bus stops momentarily at a small cluster of buildings around an intersection. The Kid is the only passenger to get off here. As the bus continues on its way, he goes to an attendant in a gas station on one corner, and asks a question. Referred to a general store and post office on another corner, he crosses and goes into it. The STOREKEEPER comes back outside with him to point out the route to where he wants to go. It is along a dirt road that winds uphill behind the store. The Kid starts up the road. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nEXT. CREST OF ROAD - DAY \nThe Kid reaches the summit of the hill directly behind the crossroads, and looks down into the valley between this hill and the next one. He starts down an even narrower road leading to a little farm on a hillock in the valley. It consists of a modest cabin, a single barn, a fenced cow pasture, and a few cultivated fields. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nEXT. CRAIGIE FARM - DAY \nChristian comes around a curve in a path on one side of the house, carrying two five-gallon milk cans slung in a yoke over her shoulder. A little dog YAPS and runs from the front door of the house to the front gate. She looks in that direction and CAMERA MOVES to include The Kid as he unlatches the gate and walks toward her. After a moment's hesitation, she moves to meet him, gliding on her bare feet to keep the water in the cans from slopping out. \nCHRISTIAN Hello, Kid. \nKID Can I help you with those? \nCHRISTIAN Taking if off is harder than taking it on in. \nShe turns toward the side of the house and walks to the kitchen door. The Kid follows. \nCHRISTIAN How's The Shooter? \nKID Fine. \nCHRISTIAN You haven't played yet? \nKID Monday. \nINT. CRAIGIE KITCHEN - CHRISTIAN, THE KID AND MRS. CRAIGIE \nMRS. CRAIGIE, Christian's mother, opens the door for them, giving The Kid a sharp, appraising glance. \nCHRISTIAN This is Eric, Mama. He's come to see me. \nMRS. CRAIGIE How do, Eric. \nChristian crosses to the drain sink near the pump and turns her back. Mrs. Craigie lifts the cans off the yoke on to the drain board. She and Christian each take a can and pour the water from it to prime the pump. \nCHRISTIAN We lost suction on the pump right in the middle of canning. \nThe Kid looks at the stove with a couple of large steaming pots on it, and the table alongside with a half-dozen hampers of green beans. \nMRS. CRAIGIE There's coffee. And sour ham and bread in the warmer, if you're hungry Eric. \nAs soon as they are finished with the pump, Mrs. Craigie and Christian turn to the table, where they begin to snip stems and cut beans before putting them into the pots on the stove. \nMRS. CRAIGIE You know anything about canning, you know we can't stop now. If we'd been looking for company, we never would have started. \nCHRISTIAN Spring beans, you have to cook them fast. But you find yourself some breakfast. \n", "test3_true": "CHRISTIAN You can stay with us tonight and still make it back to St. Lou on the Sunday schedule by about midnight. I told Mama and Papa about The Man. And all. \nKID Where is Mr. Craigie? \nMRS. CRAIGIE To the barn. Why don't you go down and introduce yourself? Christian and me'll be at this another hour or two. \nKID I think I will. I think I'd like that. (to Christian) Okay? \nCHRISTIAN Sure. And I'll see you a little later on. (then, as he starts out) Papa don't know everything. About you and me. \nThe Kid looks quickly at her and then at Mrs. Craigie, who keeps her gaze fixed on the beans. \nEXT. CRAIGIE BARN - CRAIGIE - DAY \nHe is pitching manure from all over the cow-lot into a pile banked against the side of the barn, working a long-handled shovel with practised ease. He looks o.s. and sees The Kid approaching but continues his work as The Kid enters the SHOT. Nor does he stop shoveling while they are talking, except at moments of particular significance to him. \nCRAIGIE Hello. \nKID How do you do, Mr. Craigie. I'm Eric Stoner. \nCRAIGIE Christian's Eric. \nKID That's right. \nCRAIGIE You seen her? \nKID She's helping her mother can. \nCRAIGIE You minding to marry Christian? \nThe Kid looks at him a long moment then -- \nKID You got any objections if I do, or if I don't? \nCraigie takes a couple of steps toward The Kid, his boots sucking in the muddy ground. \nCRAIGIE Son, that's what I call a sharp answer. \nKID It was what I call a sharp question. \nCRAIGIE We don't know much about you, Christian's mother and me. \nKID I'm what's known as a three-river man. Which just means I go around playing stud poker wherever I can find the kind of action I'm looking for. \nCRAIGIE You met Christian when she was working to Hot Springs? \nKID Yeah. I was playing in this game in the hotel and she was a waitress in the coffee shop. We went out. I told her I thought she could get a better job in St. Louis. \nCRAIGIE Now how did you happen to tell her that? Maybe you run some kind of employment service on the side? \nKID I said it because I wanted her in St. Louis. Anyway, she made it there and she called me and we been seeing each other ever since. \nCRAIGIE Living together? \nThe Kid takes his time before deciding how to answer this one. \nKID Yeah, living together. \nCRAIGIE How come she come home now? She going to have a baby? \nKID Not that I know of. \nCRAIGIE You two have a fight? \nKID No. \nCRAIGIE She must have had a reason. \nKID Think so? Well, you've known her longer than me. (then) Look, Mr. Craigie, let me and Christian find out a few things then maybe I won't have to answer your questions. \nCRAIGIE I never run across anybody like you. I guess I don't understand gamblers. \nKID That's all right. I don't understand farmers. \nCRAIGIE You say things that sound smart alecky. But I'm not sure if they really are smart alecky. \nKID Well I can't take into account what somebody's going to feel every time I say something. \nCRAIGIE Are you a believer? \nKID In some things. \n", "test3_id": 2111}

{"train": "THE CINCINNATI KID \nWritten by \nRing Lardner Jr. and Terry Southern \nBased on a novel by \nRichard Jessup \nSHOOTING DRAFT - 1965 \nFADE IN: SERIES OF ESTABLISHING SHOTS - DAY \nExterior scenes of St. Louis, particularly the riverside industrial district. Even more important to establish than the place is the time: end of summer, 1936. Election posters would help, with the Republican ones stressing such themes as \"Burst the Roosevelt Bubble,\" \"Save the American Way of Life,\" \"Vote for Landon and Knox.\" \nEXT. FACTORY - DAY \nOne of the most typical scenes of the day: a mass picket line outside a textile or shoe factory. And the picketing is anything but peaceful; the demonstrators are in direct conflict with the police, who are trying to keep an entrance open for strike-breakers. Whatever the general action, a small segment of struggle breaks off from it, and it is this that our CAMERA picks up: some police chasing some pickets or some pickets chasing some strike-breakers, the one faction pursuing the other up an alley with violent intent. \nEXT. ALLEY - DAY \nA couple of the pursuers catch up to the pursued and assault them with clubs or other weapons. The fighting is bitter, dirty and noisy. \nINT. KITCHEN IN SLEAZY RESTAURANT NEAR RAILROAD \nThe eight men gathered here in a game of five-card stud are clearly removed from the struggle outside, even though the SOUNDS of it are very close, coming through window opening on the alley. In fact the noise is so loud that the DEALER of the hand in progress reacts in annoyance. \nDEALER Somebody shut the goddam window. Let a man think. \nThe player nearest the window shuts it. The Dealer, who also owns the restaurant, is the talkative type of poker player. Except for THE CINCINNATI KID, the other men at the table look like hoods of one sort or another: gunmen, labor spies, extortionists, what have you. The man who fancies himself the toughest of them all is named DANNY, and he and The Kid have almost all the money on the table between them, about a hundred dollars in front of each. No other player has more than a few dollars left, and now, as fifth cards are dealt, there is about forty dollars in the pot. Only four men are left in the hand. \nDEALER Possible straight gets a -- (deals the card) -- lovely little four. \nFIRST PLAYER On the last hand even, you couldn't give me a break. \nDEALER I put the brakes on your straight, didn't I? (he laughs; no one else does; he deals to The Kid) There you are, son, a gorgeous deuce. \nKID Thanks. \nDEALER (deals to Danny) And our lucky friend from Chicago gets a queen with his pair of sixes. Little lady make you happy, Buster? \nDANNY Deal to yourself, clown. \nDEALER Dealer gives himself a -- (deals card and groans) I might have known. (to Danny) Bet your sixes, Buster. \nDANNY I told you not to call me that. (then as the dealer turns away) Cost you -- (counts out his money) Ninety-four bucks. \nDEALER Biggest pot of the whole game, I got to drop. \nDANNY (to First Player) Interested? \nFIRST PLAYER Wouldn't call you if I had a pair higher'n sixes. Which I ain't. \nHe turns over his cards, leaving it up to The Kid. \nKID Don't seem like he'd bet out without something better than the sixes, does it? (fingers hole card as if to fold) Cost me every cent I've won since yesterday afternoon. (studies Danny's face) But I tell you, I got this stubborn streak. Call the ninety-four dollars. \nHe counts out the money, which is almost all he has. \nDANNY (indignantly) You can't have better than a pair of kings! \nKID Oh, I'm not claiming anything that fine. (turns over an eight, making a pair of them) Just enough to beat the pair of sixes. \nDANNY You seen my hole card, you bastard! (indicating Dealer) He was dealing them high. \nAttending to first things first, The Kid has been pulling in the pot, adding it to his own stake, and pocketing the total. Now as Danny accuses him again, The Kid looks him squarely in the face. \nDANNY You stole that dough. \nKID You better watch those loose lips of yours, you want to have any teeth left behind them -- Buster. \nHe stands up. \nDANNY You wouldn't of shelled out ninety- four bucks -- \nKID I called you on account of I didn't think you had another pair or another six and I know a punk like you would get greedy and try and buy the last hand. \nHe walks off, disappearing through a door marked \"MEN.\" \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - THE KID AT MIRROR \nINT. BAR - CLOSE SHOT - DRINKING MAN \nHe reacts to the news in a big way. CAMERA PANS to another DRINKING MAN, who is equally impressed. They exchange looks. \nFIRST DRINKING MAN Kid's been laying for him a long time. \nINT. BARBER SHOP - BARBER AND CUSTOMER \nBARBER You ask me, The Kid'll go after him as soon as he hears. \nCUSTOMER Who's got a better right? \nINT. HOBAN'S POOL ROOM - HOBAN AND THE SHOOTER \nWe are in the front room where the pool tables are. Through an open door in b.g., we can see the unadvertised but unconcealed other activity of the establishment: a poker game in progress. \nHOBAN You going to tell The Kid, Shooter? \nSHOOTER Hell, I can't not tell him. \nHOBAN It's where he's been headed for years. \nThe Kid enters the place through the front door, still a little dishevelled from his escape. \nKID (in greeting) Hey! \nHOBAN What you say, Kid? \nKID Hey, Hoban. \nSHOOTER Where you been? Boys been holding a chair for you in back. \nKID Business opportunity come along. Something too good to pass up. \nSHOOTER Turn a profit? \nKID Yeah, did okay. Except I almost had it took back. \nHOBAN Oh, one of those. \nSHOOTER (concerned) You been in too many rough ones lately, Kid. You can't go on forever, coming out in one piece. \nKID I got to build my stake, Aren't enough chances in this town to let one go. \nHOBAN You're too good, that's your trouble. People who know you're the Cincinnati Kid, they don't want to sit down with you -- \nKID For nickels and dimes... Thing is I've about used up St. Louis. \nSHOOTER (nodding) The streets are getting full of guys you've hustled. \nKID Been thinking about Miami. There's nothing to keep me here. \nSHOOTER (after a moment) The hell there isn't (as the Kid looks at him) Lancey Hodges' in town. \nKID Yeah? (then) The Man himself, here in St. Louis -- I might just stick around Shooter. \nINT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM \nLancey is on the phone, sitting on the bed. \nLANCEY (into phone) Mr. Schlaegel? How are you? And your enchanting wife?... Tomorrow is quite convenient... I generally prefer stud but you name it... Your stakes are my pleasure, sir... Thank you, why don't we make it after lunch? My diet these days is enough to spoil anyone else's appetite... A pleasure, sir. Please remember me to your charming wife. \nHe hangs up and some of the strength seems to go out of him, as if he had been through too long a sustained effort. His eyes show that he is feeling pain and he breathes deeply. \nEXT. HAROLD STREET - DAY \nHarold Street leads to the river and we follow The Kid and The Shooter as they walk down it in the gathering dusk. \nSHOOTER (lighting a cigar) I been seeing it coming for a long time, Kid. Long time. \nKID I ain't exactly been hiding it. \nSHOOTER No, you ain't been hiding it. \nKID Well I got to know. \nSHOOTER Sure, you got to know. We all got to know. \nKID Sometime or other we got to find out how much juice we got. \nSHOOTER That's why I had to tell you. \nSHOOTER He won't, the way I'll spread the word. He'll have to take you on, someone in your class. If he ducked it, that'd make you The Man. \nKID You think he knows I'm around? \nSHOOTER He can smell meat like you a mile and a half up the river. He knows you're around and he'll sit down with you. You want to butt heads with The Man, I'll set it up. \nAhead, on the levee, CHRISTIAN is seen waiting for The Kid. She has not yet seen them as they approach off the pier. \nSHOOTER There's your woman. \nKID I wouldn't want to wait around too long. I want to get in and get it over with. \nSHOOTER He must of come to St. Louis for a big money game. I'll probably get asked do I want to deal it for them. And however long that takes, he'll have to rest up for you. \nKID Oh, well, if he's tooling a dollar, I can understand that. Sure. \nSHOOTER You got much of a stake? \nKID Close to three grand. \nSHOOTER Work on it. But three grand will give you a ride and even if you don't win, why you'll come away with a good idea of what you're made of. But once you go in Kid you can't quit. You get that straight right now. Two of you go in and only one of you can come out. \nChristian sees them and moves toward them. \nKID Well, school's out. I damn sure don't want no lessons. I want everything he's got. \nSHOOTER It's the only way to be, Kid. \nShooter turns away abruptly as Christian arrives, giving her a brief nod. \nSHOOTER See you. \nThe Kid takes Christian's arm automatically; he watches The Shooter walk way down Harold Street. He and Christian head in another direction. She is humming a mountain tune. \nCHRISTIAN When we leaving town, Kid? This week? \nKID No, I won't be ready. Not for a while. \nCHRISTIAN I thought -- \nKID Might even turn out we don't go. \nShe is surprised by this and, in her own hesitant way, curious. \nCHRISTIAN You must feel different about it than you did Saturday. \nHe looks at her fondly and, for one fleeting moment of weakness, is actually tempted to tell her about Lancey. But it is too sharp a break with tradition. \nKID Yeah, I'm feeling a little different. (TIME LAPSE) \nINT. KID'S BEDROOM \nIt is night and the room is lit only by a single lamp where Christian sits in her nightgown on a chair by the window, turning over the pages of a mail-order catalogue. In f.g. The Kid lies on his back under a sheet on the bed, his eyes closed and his hands clasped tensely behind his neck. He opens his eyes and turns to look at her. The movement catches her eye, and she instantly stops turning the pages, afraid the noise has disturbed him. \nKID It's all right. You don't have to act like a cat. You're not bothering me. \nCHRISTIAN You want me to turn out the light? \nKID No. I'm overtired, that's why I can't sleep. (sits up and swings his feet to the floor) Why can't you sleep? \nCHRISTIAN (lightly) Undertired, I guess. If a person rests all day, she doesn't have much to rest up from at night. (stands up) Why don't you have a nice hot bath? I could give you a rubdown and then you could have a nice hot bath, and then maybe you could sleep. \nShe waits at the foot of the bed for him to come slowly to a decision. \nKID 'Kay. Can't hurt to try it. \nShe goes into the bathroom, where she turns the water on gently so the tub will take a long while to fill. Then she takes a bottle of alcohol from the medicine chest and returns to the bedroom with it. She stands in front of him waiting for him to move, but The Kid is singularly listless. Not till she sets the bottle down does he respond by turning his face to the pillow. She goes right to work on his shoulder muscles, and she seems to know what she is doing. \nKID What did you do with yourself this time? \nCHRISTIAN Last night I went to a movie with The Shooter's woman. French movie. \nKID In French? \nCHRISTIAN They had the words in English at the bottom of the picture. But The Shooter's woman knew what they were saying without it. Pig's woman or somebody told me she went to college. \nKID Sure. Majored in man-eating. \nCHRISTIAN I think maybe she really did go. But I never quite dared to up and ask her. \nKID I didn't know you ran with The Shooter's woman. \nCHRISTIAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Would you wear it in public? \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Christian and Melba looking at the display. \nMELBA Wouldn't be much point wearing it in private. Sure, why not, as long as you don't have a bulge to hide? \nThey start walking. \nCHRISTIAN I don't know, Melba. \nMELBA (looking her over) My guess is there isn't anything about you needs hiding. But I'll give you a more definitive opinion at the bath. \nCHRISTIAN (startled) At the what? \nMELBA Turkish Bath. After we're through shopping. I'm treating you, Christian. \nCHRISTIAN I never been. I'm not even sure what you do. \nMELBA You don't do anything. That's what's so marvelous. They do it to you. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. STEAM ROOM \nCAMERA finds Christian and Melba among the perspiring females. \nCHRISTIAN The third time I stayed. Never went back to the boarding house except to pick up my things. \nMELBA And that side of it's held up? No complaints in the bed department? \nCHRISTIAN Well, just one. \nMELBA (intrigued) Yes? \nCHRISTIAN The nights he isn't there. \nMELBA He really does that to you, does he? You got one of the rare ones. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. MASSAGE ROOM \nChristian and Melba are on adjoining rubbing tables, a curtain separating them from the waist down only. Their heads are close enough so they can talk without their masseurs necessarily hearing every word they say. \nCHRISTIAN You find a guy, you love him, and that's it. It's supposed to just go on like that for life. Right? \nMELBA According to the propaganda, right. \nCHRISTIAN But it isn't my life, it's his life, with me tacked on. You have any idea what it's like to be a hash slinger in a cheap restaurant? \nMELBA No, honey, the stock crash wafted me right from the daisy chain into unmarried bliss. \nCHRISTIAN It's hell, if you'll excuse the word. But I didn't want to quit. The Kid made me. I felt I ought to hang on to something that was me away from him. You know what I mean? \nMELBA Sure. Some girls solve the problem by taking on an extra guy. \nCHRISTIAN I'm serious. Having children might take care of it, I don't know. Or -- this is really a terrible thing to admit. \nMELBA Your most sordid secrets are safe with me. Confess. \nCHRISTIAN If he was rich, or famous -- \nMELBA Why don't you give him both? \nCHRISTIAN (smiling) Why not? Well, if he was rich and famous, maybe I wouldn't mind so much just being -- just a woman to him. Do you think that might make it seem more worthwhile somehow? \nMELBA Somehow! Are you sincere, sweetie? (reacting to the masseur's touch) Oooo -- divine. (to Christian) Isn't this heaven? \nCHRISTIAN I'm not sure. In a way it seems soft of -- \nShe is at a loss for a word. \nMELBA Decadent? Depraved? \nChristian looks blank. \nMELBA Wicked? \nCHRISTIAN Well, yes. \nMELBA That's what I meant by heaven. \nCHRISTIAN Will it be long? \nKID Why? (then) What's the matter? \nCHRISTIAN I thought -- \nKID Thought what? \nCHRISTIAN I'd go home and see Mama. \nKID I wouldn't be able to spare you much change. \nCHRISTIAN Oh, I wouldn't want much. Bus is really the best way to go. \nKID Would a hundred fish do it? For the bus and something nice to bring your Mama? \nCHRISTIAN That would be fine, Kid. Just fine. \nKID When would you want to go? \nCHRISTIAN There's no reason for not going right now unless -- \nShe lowers her eyes, finding it hard to say the words. \nKID Unless what? \nCHRISTIAN Unless you wanted to go to bed first. \nKID Do you want to? Would you like it? \nCHRISTIAN Un-huh. I'd like it. \nKID You want dessert? \nCHRISTIAN No. You? \nKID (shakes head) Coffee? \nCHRISTIAN I don't need it. \nKID Neither do I. \nHe looks o.s. raising a hand to summon the check. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. KID'S APARTMENT - DARKENED WINDOW \nIt is dark in the room and dark outside, the street lamps furnishing only enough light for a faint border around the window shade. Christian's head and nude back move into the Shot; she pulls the shade aside to look out. \nLONG SHOT - ILLUMINATED CLOCK - CHRISTIAN'S P.O.V. - NIGHT \nThe time is a few minutes before ten. \nINT. KID'S APARTMENT - CHRISTIAN \nShe lets the shade fall back into place. Moving quietly in the darkness, she begins to dress. CAMERA PULLS BACK and PANS to include The Kid, lying on the bed with a sheet over him. He seems to be asleep until he speaks. \nKID You still haven't said it. \nCHRISTIAN Said what? \nKID If you're coming back. \nChristian abandons the process of dressing herself and sits down in the easy chair to answer this question. \nCHRISTIAN Maybe I ought to stay with Mama and Papa a while, and see. \nKID What's to see? \nCHRISTIAN I never did like city streets. \nKID Oh. \nCHRISTIAN Uh-huh. The promise didn't fulfill itself for me. \nKID Promise? \nCHRISTIAN Come to the city and all. Electric lights and flush toilets. All the pretty dreams -- it was all promise. \nKID Oh, I see. \nHe stands up but doesn't move toward her. \nKID Sure you are. You're The Shooter's woman. \nMELBA Right. And maybe I'll go on being The Shooter's Woman, even after you and I have had our little romp. What do you think about that? \nKID First place, Old Shooter'll come barging through that door any minute. He said they were winding it up. \nMELBA No barging. He doesn't have his key with him. (stands up) Have to buzz from downstairs. (moves toward him provocatively) So we can treat ourselves to a little sample of things to come. \nThe Kid stays where he is as she comes up against him. \nKID Also it don't mean anything to you, you're Christian's friend? \nMELBA Honey, she lost her franchise the minute she got on that bus. You know that. (her arms around him) I have a shaky sense of security, Kid. Don't make me feel unwanted. \nHe kisses her and lets himself enjoy it for a while, then pulls away. \nMELBA No good? \nKID You know damn well how good it was. Where's a pack of cards? \nMELBA What do we need cards for? \nKID Gin or casino, you name it. All I know is we're switching to another indoor sport. \nINT. ROOM IN PLUSH HOTEL \nThe poker game is over. Two of the Wealthy Types have already departed; one is finishing a drink on the way out; another is putting his winnings into his wallet; a third is writing out a check. Lancey and The Shooter still sit at the table in f.g. \nSHOOTER Lady Fingers'll want to come, I bet, and she's right on the edge of her stake. She could spell me dealing. \nLANCEY Sure, sure. Haven't seen the dear old bitch in fifteen years. \nSHOOTER Well, that's it, then. Monday night, Room Three-Eleven at the Dorset Hotel. And may the best man win. \nLANCEY Yes, that's how it usually comes out in the long run. You think this boy is going to give me trouble, Shooter? \nSHOOTER Yeah, he's going to give you trouble. \nLANCEY I don't want it to be one of those marathon games. Not any more. \nSHOOTER Like the session with The Portugee at Jolly's in Omaha. Remember? \nLANCEY Sure, sure. Longest game I ever played though, I was a kid on my way to the Klondike gold rush. At Soapy Smith's in Skagway. Four nights and three days. \nSHOOTER You win? \nLANCEY Depends how you look at it. When we wound up, the Yukon River had frozen over and you couldn't get through to Dawson City till the following June. Made myself a Hundred and fifty bucks and missed the gold rush. \nSHOOTER You been around a long time. \nLANCEY That is undeniably true. But it doesn't mean I'm ready to retire. How old is this boy of yours? \nSHOOTER Twenty-six, twenty-eight, something like that. \nLANCEY Well, now, makes me feel a whole lot better, knowing that. I was thirty- six when I sliced up Eddie the Dude. This Kid of yours is just going to have to wait a few years. \nINT. CORRIDOR, PLUSH HOTEL - FELIX \nHe is standing by an elevator in f.g. keeping watch on a row of room doors including the site of the poker game. FELIX is an impressive physical specimen whose capacity for brutality is masked by a quiet, deferential manner. When he sees a door open, he moves so as to be out of The Shooter's sight as the latter comes toward him. It isn't until The Shooter rounds the corner in f.g. and presses the button for the elevator that Felix makes his presence known. \nFELIX Excuse me, Mr. Shooter, sir, but Mr. Schlaegel asked me to remind you how eager he was to see you. \nThe doors of the elevator open. Felix yields precedence to The Shooter and they enter it. The doors close. \nINT. LOBBY, PLUSH HOTEL - AT THE ELEVATORS \nAn elevator opens, and The Shooter and Felix come out. \nSHOOTER I ought to call my woman. \nFELIX Yes, of course. They always like to know it if you're going to be late for supper. \nCAMERA MOVES with them as The Shooter leads the way to a row of telephone booths and enters one. \nINT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - MELBA AND THE KID \nThey are sitting at the table in a game of casino. She plays an ace from her hand, adds a seven from the board, and lays them both on top of a three-card pile. \nMELBA Still building eights. \nHe starts out. Melba stares after him, scarcely able to believe what is being done to her. \nMELBA Sure, it means I'm your mother. \nEXT. SCHLAEGEL ESTATE - DAY \nAn expensive automobile, with Felix at the wheel and The Shooter next to him in the front seat, approaches the main house of a lavish estate in a St. Louis suburb. It continues along the driveway past the house. \nEXT. AREA AROUND SWIMMING POOL - CLOSE - BILL AND BABY \nIn swimming trunks, Bill is spoon-feeding a year-old BABY in a highchair. Looking o.s., he waves in greeting to The Shooter. \nEXT. SCHLAEGEL ESTATE - THE SHOOTER \nHe walks from the parked car toward the pool, returning Bill's salutation. \nEXT. AREA AROUND POOL \nSHOOTING from behind The Shooter as he approaches the attractive family group that includes, besides Bill and the baby, a FIVE-YEAR-OLD GIRL who is having her hair brushed after swimming by ROSANNA SCHLAEGEL, her beautiful mother. A family dog completes the picture. Bill continues to feed the baby as he hails The Shooter. \nBILL Shooter -- very generous of you to come on such short notice. Rosanna you know, and I think you've met my daughter June. (indicating baby) No point introducing you to William the Fourth. He has a bad memory for names. \nSHOOTER (greeting them in turn) Mrs. Schlaegel. How are you, June. What's it all about, Bill? \nBILL Little something I'd like to sound you out on. But the least I can do is offer you a drink. \nROSANNA Like me to fix it, love? \nBILL Wonderful. Why don't you do a batch of your Bloody Marys? If that's okay with you, Shooter? \nSHOOTER Great. Whatever. \nAs she goes off, Rosanna cautions June about her hair. \nROSANNA Just don't let it get wet again. \nAs soon as his wife is gone, Bill goes right to the topic he doesn't want to discuss in her presence. \nBILL I've been quite busy on the telephone since I last saw you. There's a lot of interest all over the country in this game with Lancey and The Kid. \nSHOOTER Betting interest? \nBILL Jack Doyle in New York is giving twelve to five on Lancey. Same odds in Reno. I've taken fifty thousand of it so far. \nSHOOTER Fifty thousand! \nBILL I'll probably go for more but I didn't want to rock the odds. \nSHOOTER I knew you liked The Kid's style but why you going in so deep? \nBILL Two reasons. First, I want to see that smug old bastard gutted worse than he gutted me. Second, as long as that's going to happen, I don't see why I shouldn't make some money out of it. \nSHOOTER But how can you be so sure? The Kid could do it, we both know that, but -- \nBILL \"Could\" isn't good enough for a man who hates to lose money as much as I do. He's going to need help -- from the best man with a pack of cards between Omaha and New Orleans. \nSHOOTER Not a chance, Bill. You ought to know I never ever use what I got with the cards for nothing but tricks and dressing up a game. \nBILL Sure, I know it. That's why you're the man they choose to give them a square deal. That's what makes it so perfect. Nobody'll be looking for it. \nSHOOTER It's out. Out. \nBILL The great thing is they'll be so close, The Kid won't need much. Three or four key hands. \nSHOOTER Understand this, Bill. I'd like for The Kid to win, and I sure as hell don't want to see you lose all that money -- \nBILL If I did, I'd have to collect that twelve grand you owe me. Not myself. My collection agents. You knew poor Wildwood Jones, didn't you? \nSHOOTER OK but I'm paying it off! It's comin' in ain't it? Six grand already. (then as Bill just looks at him) Bill, you got to listen to me --! \nBILL No, I don't. It's quite the other way around. You have some delusion you're a free agent, but you're not. I own you. \nSHOOTER For God's sake --! \nBILL Shut up. I'll cross the twelve off the books and give you ten thousand dollars in cash. And you can tell The Kid if he needs more of a stake, I'll put it up. (looks o.s. and smiles) Marvelous. Here's Rosanna with what you need. \nCAMERA MOVES to include Rosanna carrying a tray with glasses and a pitcher full of Bloody Marys. \nBILL -- for that dry feeling on the roof of your mouth. (TIME LAPSE) \nINT. KID'S APARTMENT - CLOSE SHOT - WINDOW - DAY \nJANSEN We got to get you loosened up. I never felt you this tight. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. BUS TERMINAL - PHONE BOOTH - THE KID \nHe is in the middle of a call. \nKID (into phone) Just tell The Shooter I'll be there on the dot Monday night. \nMELBA'S VOICE (over the phone) And until then? \nKID He doesn't have to know. \nINT. THE SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - MELBA \nMELBA (into phone) I'm not asking for him. \nINT. BUS TERMINAL - THE KID \nHe hangs up the phone, rather than continue the discussion. CAMERA FOLLOWS him as he comes out of the booth, picks up a small duffel bag, and walks to the door that leads to the busses. He goes out into the night and gets into a bus. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nEXT. RURAL HIGHWAY - DAY \nA bus drives along a main road in the Ozarks, heading toward CAMERA. As it comes close, the name of its destination: \"FAYETTEVILLE\" can be read. \nEXT. CROSSROADS COMMUNITY - DAY \nThe bus stops momentarily at a small cluster of buildings around an intersection. The Kid is the only passenger to get off here. As the bus continues on its way, he goes to an attendant in a gas station on one corner, and asks a question. Referred to a general store and post office on another corner, he crosses and goes into it. The STOREKEEPER comes back outside with him to point out the route to where he wants to go. It is along a dirt road that winds uphill behind the store. The Kid starts up the road. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nEXT. CREST OF ROAD - DAY \nThe Kid reaches the summit of the hill directly behind the crossroads, and looks down into the valley between this hill and the next one. He starts down an even narrower road leading to a little farm on a hillock in the valley. It consists of a modest cabin, a single barn, a fenced cow pasture, and a few cultivated fields. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nEXT. CRAIGIE FARM - DAY \nChristian comes around a curve in a path on one side of the house, carrying two five-gallon milk cans slung in a yoke over her shoulder. A little dog YAPS and runs from the front door of the house to the front gate. She looks in that direction and CAMERA MOVES to include The Kid as he unlatches the gate and walks toward her. After a moment's hesitation, she moves to meet him, gliding on her bare feet to keep the water in the cans from slopping out. \nCHRISTIAN Hello, Kid. \nKID Can I help you with those? \nCHRISTIAN Taking if off is harder than taking it on in. \nShe turns toward the side of the house and walks to the kitchen door. The Kid follows. \nCHRISTIAN How's The Shooter? \nKID Fine. \nCHRISTIAN You haven't played yet? \nKID Monday. \nINT. CRAIGIE KITCHEN - CHRISTIAN, THE KID AND MRS. CRAIGIE \nMRS. CRAIGIE, Christian's mother, opens the door for them, giving The Kid a sharp, appraising glance. \nCHRISTIAN This is Eric, Mama. He's come to see me. \nMRS. CRAIGIE How do, Eric. \nChristian crosses to the drain sink near the pump and turns her back. Mrs. Craigie lifts the cans off the yoke on to the drain board. She and Christian each take a can and pour the water from it to prime the pump. \nCHRISTIAN We lost suction on the pump right in the middle of canning. \nThe Kid looks at the stove with a couple of large steaming pots on it, and the table alongside with a half-dozen hampers of green beans. \nMRS. CRAIGIE There's coffee. And sour ham and bread in the warmer, if you're hungry Eric. \nAs soon as they are finished with the pump, Mrs. Craigie and Christian turn to the table, where they begin to snip stems and cut beans before putting them into the pots on the stove. \nMRS. CRAIGIE You know anything about canning, you know we can't stop now. If we'd been looking for company, we never would have started. \nCHRISTIAN Spring beans, you have to cook them fast. But you find yourself some breakfast. \nCRAIGIE I mean in God. \nKID That's a tough one. I don't disbelieve in Him, but I couldn't say I believed in Him either. I guess I just never paid Him much mind. Didn't seem important. \nCRAIGIE God not important? \nKID I don't mean what He does isn't important -- if He exists. I mean it's not important to me whether He exists or not. \nCRAIGIE Christian was raised in a Christian home. \nKID Is that so? I didn't know --- (then) I'm not aware of the difference. (pause) I'm not asking permission to marry Christian, you know. \nCRAIGIE I know. \nKID If I was, the only person I'd be asking it from is her. \nCRAIGIE (after a moment) Who is this fella Christian says you're going to play that's so important? \nKID He's the king of the stud poker players. \nCRAIGIE And you're going to play him. \nKID Yes. \nCRAIGIE Are you any good? \nKID I'm this good. The Man has got to play me. \nCRAIGIE What happens if he don't? \nKID Then I'm The Man. \nCRAIGIE That important to you? \nKID I been trying to figure that out ever since I set it up. \nCRAIGIE You playing because of money? \nKID (after a moment) Not really. \nCRAIGIE Christian said you never was much worried about money -- I been worried about money most of my life -- up until I figured out it wasn't so important. \nKID No, it's necessary, but it isn't so important. \nCRAIGIE Well how come you want to play this King fella? \nKID Ambition -- maybe security, like that. \nCRAIGIE Is it aspiration to be the King or just uncertainty about the future? \nKID I ain't looking for security if that's what you mean. \nCRAIGIE Not trying to lock something up tight and nail it down? \nKID That would figure into it. But that isn't all of it. -- It's important to me. \nCRAIGIE Now son which is more important to you, this king business or Christian? \nKID If you got the guts to ask that question, Mr. Craigie, I guess I got the guts to answer it. Christian, if you came right down to it, is not as important as doing what I have to do. \nCraigie has finished piling the manure. He puts away his shovel. \nCRAIGIE Well son, I had to know. \nKID Know what? \nCRAIGIE There never was a man worth a damn, to my mind, who let his woman stand in the way of the thing he had to do. (then) I got to go now -- see what I can do for a sick heifer. Why don't you take Christian, when her Mama lets go of her, and tell her I said you should go to the old spring. It's a good place. \nKID Thanks. I'll tell her. \nCraigie walks away. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nEXT. SPRING - DAY \nIt is a small shack against a rocky bluff. CAMERA PANS Christian and The Kid as they come down the path and enter. \nCHRISTIAN It stays warm all winter. \nDISSOLVE: \nCRAIGIE Seems like there should be something else to it -- \nKID There is -- Making the man you're playing against think he's got the best hand -- and making him pay to find out. (TIME LAPSE) \nINT. CRAIGIE KITCHEN - THE KID \nHe is lying on a cot in the darkness, next to the big wood- burning stove. Christian enters the SHOT and slips under the covers with him. \nCHRISTIAN I can't stay long. Papa'll be getting up to milk. \nKID I'm the one can't stay. I got to head for that bus. \nCHRISTIAN Why did you come, Kid? \nKID Well, hell, I don't know. I had kind of a rough time after you left. \nCHRISTIAN Rough how? \nKID Tuesday there was a ball game, but then the Cardinals went on the road. I never known time to drag so; I was all torn apart -- \nCHRISTIAN Because of the poker game coming up? \nKID That's how I read it, but I was reading it wrong. It wasn't Lancey or the game that was chewing at my insides -- \nCHRISTIAN What else is there could give you such a bad time? \nKID I finally figured it. I located where the trouble was. It was you. \nShe is genuinely surprised at this and at first a bit dismayed. But her more considered reaction is one of pleasure. \nCHRISTIAN Oh, -- \nShe kisses him. \nKID When you talk about doing something besides poker if I get to be The Man, you don't mean pass up the chance to make some dough from it for a while? \nCHRISTIAN I sure don't. I told Papa, wherever money comes from, it feels the same when you spend it. \nKID You were going to do some thinking down here. \nCHRISTIAN I done some. \nThen they both react as Craigie can be heard getting up. \nKID I'll be back after the game Christian -- You wait here for me and I'll let you know. \nCHRISTIAN All right Eric -- Good luck Monday. \nShe gives him a quick kiss and stands up. \nKID I got that made now. You said it right. My time's come. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nEXT. CROSSROADS COMMUNITY - NIGHT (PRE-DAWN) \nThe sun hasn't risen yet as The Kid boards the bus for St. Louis outside the general store. \nEXT. HIGHWAY IN MISSOURI - DAY \nThe Kid's bus crossing the endless plain in the afternoon sun. \nEXT. ST. LOUIS BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT \nThe clock above the loading platform says it is a little after two in the morning as the bus pulls up, and The Kid, groggy from the long ride, gets out. \nINT. KID'S APARTMENT \nHe enters wearily, goes straight into the bedroom and collapses on the bed. After a moment he summons the energy to loosen his shoelaces and kick his shoes off. But that completes his preparations for sleep. \nINT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT \nThe Shooter is awake because he can't sleep, and Melba is awake because she is trying to persuade him to do what she considers prudent. He sighs deeply as she solicitously pours him a cup of coffee. \nSHOOTER Twenty-five years I been building a reputation. \nMELBA Handle this thing right and your reputation will be better than ever. \nINT. LANCEY'S HOTEL ROOM \nLancey is also awake, confronting a row of medicine bottles. He finishes laying out an assortment of four different pills and capsules, pours himself a glass of hot milk from a carafe, and proceeds to take the pills one at a time, with a sip of milk after each. \nThe Kid sees Lancey approaching, and turns to him. \nLANCEY Hello, Kid. Pleasure to know you. \nKID Lancey. I been looking forward a long time. \nLANCEY Sure, sure. You seem to know about everybody. Yeller from New Orleans? \nKID What do you say, Yeller? Still feeling salty with me? \nYELLER Forgiven long since. (to Lancey) We had a little jurisdictional dispute. \nKID I hustled a couple of boys, right in his territory. \nYELLER So I tried to tell him our rules down there. Colored marks are for colored hustlers. \nKID And I tried to tell him how I got no prejudice. When I'm on the edge of my stake, I hustle anybody at all, regardless of race, creed or color. Anybody at all. \nYELLER Including my girl. \nKID Hell, I figured I was doin' you a favor. \nYELLER You did. \nSuddenly they both laugh over a private memory and shake hands, obviously old friends. \nLADY FINGERS (to Lancey) Did you know Old Cottonhead died? \nLANCEY No, I hadn't heard. \nLADY FINGERS Heart give out in a high-low game. \nLANCEY (turning to The Kid) How you feel, Kid? \nKID Great. You? \nLANCEY The best. You think maybe we ought to see if we can stir up some action? \nKID Whatever you say, Lancey. You're the -- (correcting himself) You're our guest in this town. \nLANCEY Well, I'm kind of in the mood to play a little cards. \nKID I think we ought to be able to get a game together in this crowd. \nLANCEY But first you take a look at things -- make sure everything's the way you want it. I already been around. \nKID Thanks. I'll do that. \nHe turns toward the center of the room. The Shooter follows him. \nMED. SHOT - AT POKER TABLE - KID AND SHOOTER \nThe old, solidly built wooden table has been covered with a white linen cloth on top of a blanket. The cloth is tied down under the rim so that the surface of the table is flat, tight and cushioned by the blanket. The Kid presses his fingers into it to test these factors. \nSHOOTER It's an old table. Everything's pretty old in this hotel. \nKID It's solid, that's what counts. And you got the top fixed perfect. \nLancey comes into the SHOT behind them. \nLANCEY Light all right for you? \nSHOOTER Two hundred watt bulb. \nKID Fine, excellent. Okay with you? \nLANCEY Sure, sure. Shooter's set us up just great. \nKID Sure has. \nSHOOTER Thank you, gents. Tried to do the best I could. (looks from one to the other) Cards? \nLANCEY Why not? \nKID Good a time as any. \nSHOOTER (calling) Hoban! Okay! (to Kid and Lancey) You both know Joe Hoban. He's a draw poker man, but clean and straight as they come. \nHoban comes into the SHOT with a dispatch case, which he sets on the table. He unlocks it with a key and turns it upside down. Thirty sealed decks of cards spill on the table. \nHOBAN They come from the St. Louis Bridge Club, but they're poker size cards. They been bonded by the club steward and I seen him take them out of the safe. Shooter, Lady Fingers and me pick them up and come straight here with them. \nThe Kid has taken his roll from his pocket and is counting it out rapidly. The other players watch, interested to see how much he is putting out. After counting out one stack of thirty hundreds, he distributes the rest in stacks of twenties, tens and fives, folding each bill over once as protection against picking up more than one at a time. \nSHOOTER Gentlemen, this is a game of five- card stud poker. There is no limit. A dead man has one half hour to raise his roll outside and get back in the game. \nThe Kid has completed his count. \nREVERSE ANGLE - FEATURING LANCEY \nHe takes the money from his satchel. \nLANCEY Five grand? Nice, tidy sum. I'll put out the same. \nCAMERA PANS to Yeller. \nYELLER I swear I don't know what I'm doing sitting down with you titans, but maybe it's worth putting up five thousand for the educational value. \nCAMERA PANS to Pig as he brings out a roll and drops it casually in front of him. \nPIG I'll play with what I have in my pocket till I have to send out for more. Twenty-seven, twenty-eight hundred, I don't know. \nCAMERA PANS past The Kid to Sokal, who is counting out bills from an impressive roll. \nSOKAL Five G's, I'm with it. Don't mean I'm goin' blow it all, though. \nCAMERA PANS to The Shooter, who is counting out a smaller stake than anyone. \nSHOOTER Last and certainly least -- \nHe puts his money out without counting it, takes a deck of cards, rips the cellophane off it, takes the jokers and tosses them offhandedly to one side, not seeming to take aim. \nFEATURING THE JOKERS \nHeads turn as the cards sail through the air in unison, landing inside The Shooter's familiar hat, which is resting crown down on the mantelpiece. The spectators gape at the display of dexterity. \nFEATURING THE SHOOTER \nHe begins to shuffle and all eyes are upon him, not from suspicion but from pure admiration. He is in peak form, shuffling six times, once for each player and then slapping the cards down before Lancey, who is to the right of him, with an empty chair in between. \nCLOSE - LANCEY \nHe waives his privilege of cutting with a barely perceptible nod. \nTHE POKER TABLE \nThe Shooter acknowledges the compliment with the same sort of gesture. Then he begins to deal in his magnificently precise way, pitching each card so that it comes to a stop six inches in front of the player's money and in clear view of everyone at the table. \nCLOSE SHOT - SHOOTER'S HANDS \nWith Sokal in b.g. It is notable that as The Shooter completes dealing hole cards and switches to the first up card, there is no visible difference in the motion of his hands. He calls the cards as he deals them. \nSHOOTER Seven, nine, trey, nine, ace, and The Shooter guns up a ten. Ace bets. \nLANCEY Ten dollars. \nSHOOTER Dealer folds. \nSOKAL Call the sawbuck. \nCLOSE SHOT - FROM BEHIND KID \nHe looks at his hole card: an ace. \nKID I'm in. \nPIG'S VOICE Call. \nYELLER'S VOICE Call. \nTHE POKER TABLE \nThe Shooter deals again. \nSHOOTER King to the seven, pair of nines, deuce to the trey, queen-nine, ace- eight. \nKID Nines bet twenty bucks. \nEach other player folds in turn. The Shooter pulls in the cards, and The Kid pulls in the seventy dollars. The Shooter shuffles and deals again. \nSHOOTER Queen, ten, king, four, ace again, and a king for The Shooter. \nLANCEY Ace bets ten dollars \nTHE POKER TABLE \nShooter deals another round: an eight of clubs to Sokal, a second seven to Pig, a ten to Lancey. \nSHOOTER Possible straight flush, pair of sevens. Pair of jacks are still high. \nLANCEY Check to the sevens. \nSOKAL Likewise. \nPIG (trying to be casual) Bet the size of the pot. Nine hundred and eighty dollars. \nLANCEY In for nine eighty. \nSOKAL I'll play. \nTWO SHOT - HOBAN AND BILL \nBILL What's with Lancey? I thought he'd raise with three jacks or drop with two pair. \nHOBAN He probably thinks Pig's faking the queens. Anyhow, Doc's liable take them both with a straight or a flush. \nTHE POKER TABLE \nThere is a good deal of suspense hanging on each card as The Shooter deals. Sokal gets a five of diamonds, and his disappointment is too great to conceal. \nSHOOTER Busted, no flush, no straight. Pair of sevens with a queen gets a nine. To the pair of jacks, a trey. \nPIG (counting his money, trying to be calm) Pair of sevens will bet whatever I got here. Twenty-four hundred bucks. \nLANCEY I'll call your twenty-four hundred -- \nCLOSE SHOT - THE KID \nHe watches Lancey, puzzled; this isn't what he had expected. \nLANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.) -- and raise you whatever I have left. \nThe Kid relaxes; this is more the way he figured it. \nTHE POKER TABLE \nLancey is completely calm. Pig is shattered, his whole world suddenly blown apart. \nLANCEY Comes to fourteen hundred fifty dollars, Pig. Don't imagine you'll have any problem promoting that much in half an hour -- plus whatever you care to raise me. \nAll eyes are on Pig, which doesn't make it any easier for him. He just sits there, his hands shaking. \nSHOOTER Fourteen fifty to the queens. You want to take your half hour, Pig? \nThere is another long moment before Pig flips over his up cards. \nPIG No, I'm out. Out of the game. \nHe looks at Lancey with malevolence. Lancey turns over his up cards and tosses them in front of The Shooter. Pig suddenly lunges toward the cards, wanting a look at Lancey's hole card, but Lancey is too quick for him and pushes the cards into the pack The Shooter is assembling. \nSHOOTER (to Pig) You Tap City? \nPig is suffering, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of making the dread admission. Finally he nods. The Shooter takes a ten dollar bill from his own stake, and the other four remaining players each add a ten. The Shooter pushes the money toward Pig. \nPIG I got a woman. \nSHOOTER I thought you and Hilda were quits. \nPIG We're back. \nThe other players look at The Shooter to see if he is going to accept this statement at face value. He nods, that he does, and each man contributes another ten. The Shooter passes the second fifty to Pig. \nSHOOTER See you around, Pig. \nPLAYERS (ad lib) So long, Pig -- See you -- 'Night. \nPIG (getting up) So long. \nCAMERA FOLLOWS him to the door. The spectators make room for him, no one saying anything. At the door, Pig turns back for his valedictory gesture. \nPIG Good luck -- Kid. \nHe goes out. \nCLOSE SHOT - LANCEY \nLANCEY Your age, you don't need a regular vacation every year. But me, I have to forget the grind for a couple of weeks. I go to this place near Delray Beach, and the whole time I don't play anything but bridge. \nKID That's interesting. I could go for bridge if there was a way to do it without partners. \nLANCEY I'm not keeping you from your woman, am I? \nKID (after a slight hesitation) No. We're -- she's gone away for a while. We're not sure we're looking for the same thing. \nLANCEY I'm sorry to hear that. \nKID I was hoping Christian would run with me and wouldn't try to make a big deal out of it. \nLANCEY But she tried? \nKID Yeah, and now I don't know. I don't figure a man can change his way because the way I see it a man's lucky he's got something going for him that he can hold on to. A man can't change his way for a woman. \nLANCEY Nooo, a man can't do that. \nKID I been wondering if it isn't maybe a better idea not to look for a fixed thing. Just tie in to something nice when you're away from the action, and enjoy it, and let it wear itself out. \nLANCEY (after a long moment) That's very interesting you should say that. You're pretty young to have figured things out already. \nKID Well she didn't understand how it was with me and --- \nLANCEY (warmly) Between us? \nKID There ain't but a few people, I guess who would understand -- \nLANCEY (as The Kid doesn't finish) Kid, you're the best stud man I've seen in 35 years of action. You know that? \nKID Well -- thank you. \nLANCEY And when it comes to broads, which is getting to be an academic problem -- I can look back now to the two or three I ever considered I might want to spend the rest of my life with, and you know what? I like it... looking back on them, that is -- (then) I always got a lot of companionship out of a good book. \nKID It's very educational, hearing what it's like for a man your age. \nLANCEY Glad to be of help. And it's good we had this little talk so I know we can be friends regardless what happens. \nKID That sounds good to me. I didn't think you was coming in at me like a grudge match. \nLANCEY No room for any kind of emotion in a fair game of stud. I learned that a long time ago. \nLADY FINGERS' VOICE (O.S.) Ready for some action, gentlemen. \nThey look at each other and then exit. \nANGLE INCLUDING THE POKER TABLE \nLady Fingers is sitting in Shooter's place, rippling and shuffling the cards. Yeller, Sokal, and The Shooter are all either sitting at the table or standing near it. Lancey, followed by The Kid, returns to the table. \nLADY FINGERS It's a whole New Deal. Good hands all around. Prosperity for everybody. \nLANCEY You're still good, Fingers. \nLADY FINGERS Getting crippled up, Lancey. Not many of the old gang left. You heard Whistling Sam was gone? \nLANCEY No, I didn't hear. \nLADY FINGERS I was the one got called to the morgue to identify him. I don't suppose you seen anybody been run over by a twelve- ton bulldozer. \nLANCEY No, can't say that I have. \nLADY FINGERS Don't go out of your way. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. POKER SUITE - TOWARD WINDOWS \nMorning sunlight is streaming in. \nTHE POKER TABLE \nThe Kid, facing the sun, wears his eyeshade. The Shooter has resumed the deal and now hands out last cards to Sokal, The Kid and himself. \nSHOOTER Bet the pot. Four hundred and twenty dollars. \nSOKAL Fold. \nKID It's yours. \nSHOOTER Thanks, gents. Makes me exactly even. This kind of a game, that's a smart place to quit. (takes his money off the table) Just do the dealing, if that's all right with everybody. \nLANCEY Two thousand dollars. \nThe Kid lifts his hole card and we see it is a ten. \nKID Call two thousand. \nHe turns to watch The Shooter. \nFEATURING THE SHOOTER'S HANDS - KID'S P.O.V. \nAgain there is no indication of improper dealing as The Shooter gives Lancey an odd card and The Kid a ten, completing his full house. \nLANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.) Two thousand more. \nTHE POKER TABLE \nKID Take it. I can't beat three sevens. (then as The Shooter's eyes flicker with surprise) I'd like a break to get some food and sleep -- I'm winners so it isn't up to me to say it but I'm saying it anyway. \nHe exits. After a moment The Shooter follows. Lancey watches them go then rises, apparently still fresh and strong. Lady Fingers joins him. \nLANCEY (pleasantly) My dear, that young man is a stud poker-playing son-of-a-bitch. \nLADY FINGERS Gettin' to you, Lancey? \nLancey looks at her a moment, then smiles. \nLANCEY (softly) Not yet he isn't. \nHe moves through the crowd, then exits. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - BILL'S SUITE - THE KID & SHOOTER \nThey are alone in the room. Shooter is uncomfortable and would like to be elsewhere but The Kid is standing in front of the closed door. \nTHE KID Now, just what the hell are you trying to pull? \nSHOOTER (trying to bluff it) Nothing -- what are you talking about? \nThe Kid grabs him and slams him against the wall. \nTHE KID You, Shooter Man -- you been feeding me cards for an hour. \nSHOOTER (angry and ashamed) The hell I was. (he waits a brief moment then eases away from The Kid) Christ, Kid, even if I was you couldn't spot it -- I'm too good a mechanic for anybody to spot it. \nTHE KID (grabbing him and slamming him against the wall again) But I was looking for it, Shooter -- four times you give me the cards I need. \nSHOOTER (a little shrill) You seen it before often enough. One player draws four good ones. \nTHE KID Never in a game when I been told ahead the dealer has a stake in my coming out on top. \nSHOOTER (slumping) My woman told you. \nTHE KID She told me enough to make me start thinking. \nSHOOTER (almost pleading) Why should you bitch if I give you a little help? \nTHE KID Why, you dumb bastard? -- You have to ask me why. (ready to hit him) I could break you apart for what you've done. \nSHOOTER (backing off) Kid, you got to understand. It wasn't my idea -- \nTHE KID Well who the hell's was it then -- Schlaegel? -- \nSHOOTER He's got the squeeze on me Kid and he's meaner than hell. He'll cut me up if I don't come through. (then) You think I wanted to deal a phony game? You think it don't mean something to me? I never done a crooked thing before in my life. \nTHE KID My ass bleeds for you -- Now you get straight on this. No fix. You come along straight or I blow it wide open. \nSHOOTER He's liable to kill me. \nTHE KID He ain't goin' to do nothin' to you except pay off because I'm goin' to win. \nSHOOTER It is a hell of a chance to take. \nTHE KID You got no choice. \nSHOOTER He ain't goin' to like it. \nTHE KID (almost yelling at him) He ain't goin' to know. (then quietly) Shooter, I'm goin' to win this one -- win it my way -- and you ride with me or you're out, finished. \nSHOOTER I ride with you. \nThere is a KNOCK on the door. \nMELBA Rolls and coffee for the hard-headed hero. \nCAMERA PANS to take in the view of the bedroom as she crosses it to the door, talking as she goes. \nMELBA Believe me Kid there is too much at stake for us to rely on your doing it on your own. \nShe has paused at the door to finish her sentence. Now she unlocks and opens it -- to Christian. Melba is so taken aback she can't do anything but stand there holding the door open. The Kid, in the bathroom in f.g., is similarly frozen in his tracks. After a moment Christian advances into the room. \nREVERSE ANGLE - CHRISTIAN IN F.G. \nThe scene as it looks to Christian is circumstantially incriminating. CAMERA MOVES with her gaze from The Kid to the one mussed bed, to Melba. The faces and the silence of the two people are even more incriminating than the circumstances. \nCHRISTIAN Hello, Kid. Hello, Melba. (a pause) You said wait home 'til you let me know. \nTHE KID Yeah, that's what I said. We took a break in the game to catch some sleep. Shooter sent his woman up here to wake me up. \nMELBA Yeah, I woke him up. \nCHRISTIAN It don't take much. \nMELBA No, I didn't find it any trouble. (awkwardly) Well, you children don't need me, that's for sure. See you downstairs. (to Christian) You, too, honey, right? \nCHRISTIAN I'll be around if The Kid wants me. \nTHE KID See you, Melba. Thanks. \nMELBA Por nada, as they say. It was nothing. \nShe walks past CAMERA and a moment later comes the SOUND of the door closing behind her. The Kid, who has moved into the bedroom, crosses to his clothes on a chair, and picks up his undershorts and trousers. He returns to the bathroom, using the door for partial concealment as he removes his towel and puts on his shorts and trousers. \nTHE KID You been to the place? \nCHRISTIAN No, I've got my bag downstairs. Maybe I'll take it over later on tonight. \nTHE KID How's your Mama and Papa? \nCHRISTIAN Fine. How's the game going? \nThe Kid fastens his trousers and returns to the basin to give his face a last few strokes with the razor and wash off the soap. \nTHE KID It's come to be just me and Lancey. \nHe comes back into the bedroom to finish dressing. As his movement brings him fairly close to Christian, he realizes he hasn't kissed her, and repairs the omission before putting his shirt on. \nCHRISTIAN (after the kiss) I was wondering. \nTHE KID I got my mind on the cards. \nCHRISTIAN I know. And I don't want to rattle you. We got plenty to talk about, but it can all wait. Except I want to say this. I came back because I figured if it was going to work with us, it's silly me sitting home with Mama while you're playing your big game. I mean if I'm any use to you at all, this is when it's most important. \nTo The Kid preoccupied by the game and the fix, feeling both affection and guilt. The idea that she can be any use to him against Lancey is one he can't grasp. \nTHE KID I'm glad you came, Christian. You got as much right here as anybody. (then) More right, I should have said. \nCHRISTIAN Should you? \nTHE KID Hell, yes. The change I come out with when I win this one, you're going to be the one to spend it. \nHe moves toward the door. \nCHRISTIAN Eric -- \nTHE KID (turning back) Look, I said I'm glad you came -- and that's all until I wrap this up -- I'm a poker player, remember? \nShe looks at him. After a moment he exits. She follows. \nCUT TO: \nTHE POKER TABLE \nIt is evening. Lady Fingers deals a first up card to the two players. The Kid gets an eight, Lancey a jack. \nTHE KID The eight'll try two bills. \nLANCEY (turning his card) No stay. \nLady Fingers scoops up the cards, shuffles them into the rest of the deck, submits it to Lancey for his cut, and deals them another two cards apiece -- all in the space of seconds. The Kid gets a queen, Lancey a nine. \nTHE KID Two hundred. \nHOBAN AND YELLER \nHOBAN (excitement in his voice) The Kid is pushing it and making it stick. \nCAMERA MOVES to the other four spectators as they react to The Kid's successful streak. \nSHOOTER (in a low voice) He's getting to him. \nAnd it looks that way. Lancey appears old and unsure. The Kid sharp and cold. A young barracuda moving in for the kill. \nCAMERA MOVES in close to Christian as she tries to catch The Kid's eye. Thinking she has it, she smiles her encouragement. \nFEATURING THE KID \nHe looks right at her and doesn't seem to see her. Lady Fingers has dealt the first up cards of a new hand, and Lancey is high. \nLANCEY Two hundred. \nTHE KID And up five. \nLANCEY Fold. \nCLOSE - CHRISTIAN \nAmid the growing excitement and tension she is a complete outsider. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nTHE POKER TABLE \nThe Kid shows two jacks and two odd cards; Lancey a pair of aces and two odd cards. Lancey puts about eight hundred dollars into the pot. \nLANCEY Betting the jack isn't there, Kid. \nThe Kid exposes his hidden jack. \nSHOOTER, BILL AND MELBA \nGreed and an almost vicious satisfaction marks their faces as they watch Lancey falter. The Shooter whispers to Bill just loud enough for the girl to hear. \nSHOOTER We're in -- I think he's got him. \nChristian looks at them, then at The Kid. Hesitates a moment then suddenly gets to her feet and starts for the door. Only Melba notices her, and even she doesn't have time to question her. CAMERA FOLLOWS Christian to the suite entrance, where she picks up her bag then turns to look back at the table. \nFEATURING THE KID \nThe place where Christian was sitting is right in his line of vision but he hasn't observed her departure. \nCLOSE SHOT - CHRISTIAN \nShe goes on out the door. \nINT. POKER SUITE - ANGLE INCLUDING WINDOW \nThe second dawn of the contest is near at hand. The room, continuously lived in for so long by so many people, is a shambles of dirty glasses and plates, empty bottles, full wastebaskets and ash trays, and frayed people. At the poker table, Lady Fingers is dealing a new hand. \nLADY FINGERS A jack and a ten. Jack bets. \nCAMERA MOVES in close enough for us to see the cards. Lancey has the jack of hearts, The Kid the ten of clubs. \nLANCEY Jack is willing to wager two hundred dollars. \nThe Kid takes his first look at his hole card. \nCLOSE SHOT - SHOWING FACE OF HOLE CARD \nIt is the queen of hearts. \nTHE KID And up five hundred. \nLancey looks at him a long moment. His face pale and shaken. The Kid is beating him. Pushing -- buying -- always pressing and Lancey knows he is losing one hand at a time, not badly but consistently and inevitably. His age and fatigue are a strong handicap for the long pull. Then his face settles as if he had come to a decision. He smiles lightly summoning some last reserve of strength, almost as if he knows this will be the last hand, win or lose. \nLANCEY Call your five hundred and five hundred more. \nTHE KID (after a brief hesitation) Call. \nHOBAN AND YELLER \nHOBAN Fifty to one hundred says Lancey paired his jacks. \nYELLER Mark it. \n", "test1_input": "The Kid and Christian sit in silence. She puts her hand on his. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. BUS TERMINAL \nThe Kid and Christian sit on a bench in the waiting room, still silent. He has her suitcase between his legs and a pile of magazines on his lap. She looks at a clock and gets to her feet. He follows her to the door, carrying the suitcase and magazines. \nEXT. BUS PLATFORM - NIGHT \nChristian boards a bus that has seen better days. On the steps she turns to take the bag from him, but he follows her on. \nINT. BUS - NIGHT \nChristian takes a seat. The Kid puts her suitcase in the overhead rack and hands her the magazines, none of which would be classed as heavy reading. \nCHRISTIAN Goodbye, Kid. Good luck. \nKID Goodbye, Christian. \nThey don't kiss. He turns and goes out. \nEXT. BUS PLATFORM - NIGHT \nThere are not many passengers boarding this bus. After a couple of moments, the driver closes the door and starts off. Christian waves from the window, and The Kid waves back to her. When the bus has gone, he walks around the outside of the terminal to the front. \nEXT. FRONT OF BUS TERMINAL - NIGHT \nThere are a couple of cabs at a taxi stand. One of the hackies offers his services to The Kid, but The Kid declines. He wants to walk. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. ROOM IN PLUSH HOTEL \nIt is midday and the poker game is almost twenty- four hours old. Our attention is focused on Bill Schlaegel, who is writing out a check. \nBILL Four stacks? Right, Schooter? \nSHOOTER Four. \nThe Shooter takes advantage of the lull in the proceedings to move to the telephone. \nBILL Thank you for the entertainment, gentlemen. My particular gratitude to you, Lancey. It's been a rare pleasure to watch a great artist at work. Thank you for the privilege. \nLancey gives him a quick look, finding this a bit thick. \nLANCEY Well now, son, you're quite welcome. Can't say I recall another man, in all my days on the three rivers, who seemed to find it quite so pleasurable losing all that money. \nBill puts his check down in front of The Shooter's place, and gets to his feet. \nBILL Good day, gentlemen. You're welcome to use the premises as long as you like. \nCAMERA MOVES with Bill as he passes The Shooter, who is waiting on the phone while the hotel operator dials his number. Bill gives him a friendly pat on the back, and speaks in a low, harsh voice for The Shooter's ears alone. \nBILL I want to see you. \nBill goes out. Shooter looks after him as his party comes on the phone. \nSHOOTER (into phone) Hi, Kid. Shooter here. Listen, I told the woman I'd take her to the ball park, but I'm still working. How about you and Christian take her out? \nINT. KID'S APARTMENT \nKID (into phone) Christian's gone home to see her folks. \nINT. PLUSH HOTEL ROOM \nSHOOTER (into phone) Oh. (then) Well listen, would you mind taking her yourself? The gang'll be there, in the section... Thanks. Appreciate it. See you. \nHe hangs up, returns to the table and starts to shuffle the cards in his own spectacular way. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nEXT. BUSCH STADIUM, ST. LOUIS - DAY \nA game is in progress between the Cardinals and another National League club. The batter at the plate connects for a long one. CAMERA FOLLOWS the flight of the ball. \nEXT. STANDS - THE KID AND MELBA \nThey are making their way to meet their friends in the section they prefer. They stop to watch the ball as the fans around them rise to their feet. The section they have just reached is in the sun, overlooking the outfield. \nEXT. FIELD \n", "test1_true": "EXT. STANDS - THE KID AND MELBA \nThey start on their way again. CAMERA PANS ahead of them to a group consisting of Hoban; HOBAN'S WOMAN, still sexy in her forties; PIG, whose name could derive with equal justification from either his looks or his manners; and SOKAL, who talks colloquial American with a Central European accent. The group as a whole is notable because its members have not risen to their feet with everyone else, because all the men are basking in the sun with their shirts off, because they view the action on the field with detachment, and because, nevertheless, they are constantly placing bets on details of the game. Now, as people around them resume their seats, Sokal is able to confirm that the fly ball has been caught. \nSOKAL (to Hoban) You owe me two fish on the out, plus three on the inning, minus two on no strikeouts so far. \nThe Kid and Melba join them. \nHOBAN Hiya, Kid. Getting yourself in shape for The Man? (to Melba) Shooter still on the job? \nHOBAN'S WOMAN Where's Christian? \nMELBA (in a whisper) Lay off that. \nPIG What'd she do, take off? So did mine. Don't lose no sweat, Kid, there's plenty more where they came from. All shapes and sizes. \nKID Hi, Hoban. Sokal. Pig. \nHe and Melba sit down. \nHOBAN (to Sokal) Boyer. One to two on the sacrifice. \nSOKAL Five to three, I'll give you. Two- fifty against one-fifty. \nHOBAN Mark it. \nSOKAL I figure they'll walk him. Fill up first. \nKID Not with who's coming up. I'll take the same odds. \nWhile he is talking, Melba unbuttons his shirt. \nMELBA Get some of this sun. \nSOKAL (to The Kid) Mark it. \nKID (to Melba) Guess I will. \nHe takes his shirt off. Melba finds some suntan lotion in her bag, and applies it to her face and arms, her eyes rarely straying from The Kid. \nHOBAN Bunting, Sokal. \nEXT. BALL FIELD \nThe bunt is fielded by the first baseman, who throws to second for the out. There is no play at first. \nSOKAL So they pitched to him. I still win. \nPIG (to Kid) Everybody been on the phone to everybody about coming to watch you and Lancey. Big Spriigi, Yeller to N'Orleans, Old Lady Fingers. They're all coming. \nMELBA (to Kid) Let me give you some of this. Keep you from burning. \nKID I don't think -- \nMELBA Can't hurt you. \nWithout waiting for his approval, she goes ahead and spreads the lotion on his skin, painstakingly, as if she were applying paint to canvas, working it in, one area at a time, with her fingertips. \nHOBAN (to Sokal) Chance to invest your profits. Bet you an even fin he make first. \nSOKAL (looking toward plate) Who we got -- Warwick? You got yourself a bet, pal. \nThe men concentrate their attention on the diamond. CAMERA MOVES IN to Melba's fingers playing across The Kid's midriff. From the field comes the sharp CRACK of a bat against a ball, followed by a SHOUT from the crowd. CAMERA PANS UP to the faces of Melba and The Kid as he looks at her and she meets his gaze with inviting eyes. \nSOKAL'S VOICE Not your day, Hoban. (calling to a vendor) Hey, beer! \nMELBA (softly) Mais tu es charmant -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. SHOOTER'S APARTMENT - CLOSEUP - MELBA \nWith the same look of invitation in her eyes. \nMELBA Charmant. Come here, please. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK. Wearing the same clothes as at the ball park, she is sitting in a chair with her legs tucked under her. The Kid is sitting on a straight chair at a table on which he has a cup of coffee. They are alone in the apartment. \nKID Any special reason? \nMELBA Me. I'm special. \n", "test2_input": "THE KID If you think so. (to Christian) Sorry. \nCHRISTIAN What's wrong? \nTHE KID Nothing, Nothing you have to worry about. I'll see you later. \nHe heads for the door. Christian looks after him. \nTHE KID Get something to eat. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BILL'S SUITE \nBill and The Kid are sitting at a room-service table. Bill nibbles at some cheese and crackers while The Kid tackles a large steak. Felix, the chauffeur, stands in attendance on them. \nBILL I thought it would be better if you and I sat down together to see if we couldn't work out our differences. Felix! \nHe motions to Felix, indicating a wine bottle on the table. Felix steps over and refills The Kid's glass. \nTHE KID What I told The Shooter goes. \nBILL Are you saying no before we've even discussed it? Am I to feel all my arguments will be wasted? \nThe Kid just looks at him -- then returns to his meal. \nBILL I'll skip to the final argument. (then) More salad, perhaps? \nHe makes a peremptory gesture to Felix, who springs forward to offer the salad bowl to The Kid. \nBILL The Shooter will be back dealing when you start again. He will give you an occasional helpful card. \nTHE KID That's an argument? \nBILL That's a fact. I'm coming to the argument. \nTHE KID I'll give you a fact. I won't let it happen. \nBILL Is that knife sharp enough? Felix. \nFelix jumps into action again. He moves to The Kid's side, reaches into a breast pocket and takes out a switch blade, which he clocks open an inch or two from The Kid's neck. It is an extremely ugly-looking and menacing weapon. \nBILL See if it cuts better with that. \nFelix hands the knife to The Kid, who tries it on his steak. \nBILL Sharp? \nTHE KID Very. But it don't cut any ice with me. \nHe jams the knife in the table and snaps off the blade. \nTHE KID (rising) Not this time. He exits. \nINT. HOTEL CORRIDOR \nAs The Kid exits Christian is waiting for him. He moves down the corridor, preoccupied. She follows. \nTHE KID Did you eat? \nCHRISTIAN No. \nTHE KID (stops, looks at her irritated) Why not, for Chris sakes? \nCHRISTIAN Eric -- \nTHE KID (moving away) You should eat something. \nCHRISTIAN (loudly, stopping) I've got to talk to you. \nHe stops, looks at her. \nTHE KID Talk. \nCHRISTIAN (fumbling) It's -- about us. What's going to happen? \nTHE KID (interrupting) What's going to happen? What's going to happen for Chris sake is I'm going to win the game. (then more softly) You go back to the apartment, honey, this might take two more days. \nCHRISTIAN (flatly) If I go, I'm not going back to the apartment. If I go -- I'm just going. \nTHE KID (after a long moment) Well, that's up to you, Christian. \n", "test2_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. POKER SUITE - THE SHOOTER'S HANDS \nShuffling the cards. CAMERA PULLS BACK enough to see his face as he looks across at The Kid. CAMERA PANS to a CLOSE SHOT of The Kid, and then past a couple of spectators, including Christian and Melba, to Bill, whose eyes are on The Kid. Finally CAMERA PANS back to The Kid. \nTHE KID I told you, Shooter -- I won't go for it. \nTHE POKER TABLE - INCLUDING BILL \nBoth The Shooter and Bill are aware of a portentous note in The Kid's tone. \nLANCEY What's up? \nTHE KID The Shooter's not well. He didn't want to spoil the game, but he ought to be resting... He ought to be in the hospital. \nLANCEY Well, we got Lady Fingers. Or we can deal ourselves. \nSHOOTER I'm okay. What The Kid's talking about is nothing. It's just not important. \nTHE KID It is to me... You want to kill yourself, do it on your own time. \nLancey looks from The Kid to The Shooter, sensing that there may be something more behind this, but not knowing just what. \nLANCEY I got to go along with that, Shooter. Lady Fingers! You ready? \nCLOSE SHOT - LADY FINGERS \nRising from her chair. \nLADY FINGERS Like Eddie the Dude said on his deathbed, I'm as ready as I'll ever be. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. POKER SUITE - CLOSE SHOT - THE KID AND POKER HAND \nThe four cards showing are the ace, ten and two little clubs. As CAMERA PULLS BACK we also have time to note The Kid's stake. He is still ahead. Lancey counts out five hundred dollars from his stake, leaving about thirteen thousand, and puts it into a pot that already contains around a thousand. \nLANCEY I can't persuade myself you have the flush. \nThe Kid turns up the jack of clubs. \nLANCEY Now I can. \nThe Kid pulls in the money. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nINT. POKER SUITE - THE KID - LANCEY - AND POKER HANDS \nBoth men are showing the strain. Perhaps Lancey the most as he appears to be consistently losing. Showing are two nines and two odd cards. \nLANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.) I'm going to pay the price to look at that third nine. \nThe kid turns up another nine and reaches for the money. \nLANCEY'S VOICE (O.S.) Caveat emptor. New deck, please. \n(TIME LAPSE) \nTHE POKER TABLE - FROM BEHIND THE KID \nHe shows a pair of eights and two odd cards against Lancey's pair of queens. He takes another look at his hole card, and we see that it is of no help to him. \nTHE KID Pair of eights bets an even thousand dollars. \nHOBAN AND YELLER \nThey are both sitting on the back of the loveseat now. The binoculars pass from one to the other. Both men are tense over the growing excitement of the game. \nYELLER Ten bucks and my notoriously fallible instinct tells me the boy is bluffing this time. \nHOBAN Mark it. \nCAMERA MOVES to the other four remaining spectators: Christian, Melba, The Shooter and Bill. They are close enough to see the cards but too close to discuss them. \nTHE POKER TABLE \nThe kid has almost half the money in front of him now, and is playing with increasing assurance and pressure. \nLANCEY (turning his cards) I'm not that curious. \n", "test3_input": "Bill hisses softly into The Shooter's ear. \nBILL Kid has him, doesn't he? \nBut The Shooter, like the Kid, is white-faced and frozen by the raise. \nTHE REMAINING SPECTATORS \nThey crowd in close to the table: Hoban, Yeller, Bill, The Shooter, and Melba. \nKID (after a long moment) I'm taking my half hour to raise my stake. \nLADY FINGERS I declare a thirty-minute break. Leave your cards and money on the table. The game will start again at five forty-five. \nLANCEY I'll take your marker, Kid. \nKID I can raise it. \nLANCEY I know you can. \nKID Long as you know. (he raps the table) -- Call. \nLANCEY (turns up a heart seven) Straight flush to the jack -- That's $6700 you owe me, Kid. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE KID \nThere is nothing to be gained from a poker face now, and he reacts with a stunned expression in which all the accumulated strain and fatigue is beginning to show. CAMERA MOVES among the spectators: Hoban and Yeller, who are sorry for The Kid and admiring of Lancey; Bill, who is all the more angry at his defeat because his hopes were up; The Shooter, who is a very unhappy man; and Melba, whose anger at the Kid is balanced by her fear of Schlaegel and what will happen to The Shooter and possibly to her. \nTHE POKER TABLE \nLancey pulls in the money while The Kid stares at him dumbly. Lady Fingers riffles the cards. \nLANCEY New deck. \nLADY FINGERS Are you playing, Kid? You got a half an hour to raise your stake. \nKID No -- I'm through. \nLADY FINGERS (formally) Gentlemen, this game is over. \nLANCEY You're one hell of a poker player, Kid. That was a rough hand. \nKID Thanks. \nLANCEY What's the tab for the whole show? \nAs he settles up, the CAMERA FOLLOWS The Kid to his brandy bottle. As he pours himself a slug, Melba and Shooter join him. \nCLOSER ANGLE \nMELBA You had to do it, didn't you -- you had to go for it your own way. (then, as The Kid doesn't answer) Well, sonny, I hope you learned something. I know we sure as hell did. \nKID Where's Christian? \nMELBA She's gone. She's got too much sense to stick with a two bit loser. \nSHOOTER Shut up. (then:) Sorry, Kid. \nKID Yeah. (then:) I should have known he had it, Shooter Man. I walked into it. \nSHOOTER (trying to grin as Schlaegel and Felix move up) Well, Kid, it's like I said -- you just wasn't ready. \nBILL (to The Shooter) Are you ready, Shooter Man? We're having a meeting and I suggest you join us. \nShooter looks at him a moment and nods, and taking Melba by the arm, moves toward the door followed by Felix. \nMELBA Why me -- I'm not part of this. \nSHOOTER (jerking her forward) Oh, yes you are -- you and your big mouth -- you're part of it all right. \nSCHLAEGEL He's right, my dear. Now run along with Felix. We're going to have a long talk about that big mouth of yours. \nMelba starts to protest, but Felix jerks her out the door. Shooter hesitates, then follows. \nDIFFERENT ANGLE \nSchlaegel turns to The Kid. \nSCHLAEGEL I was wrong. I figured you for brains. But you're a loser, Kid. You had a chance to play with grownups and you ran. (then, as Lancey and Lady Fingers approach) They weren't playing your game. They were playing mine. Think about that while you find a place to hide. But hide good, Kid -- because I got a message for you and I'm going to see it delivered. \nThe Kid looks at him, looks at Lancey and Lady Fingers, wondering about what Schlaegel has said, angry about it. \n", "test3_true": "Schlaegel nods, moves to the door. \nNEW ANGLE \nLancey and Lady Fingers join The Kid. \nLADY FINGERS Never thought I'd see the day. You raising tens on a lousy three-flush. \nLANCEY Gets down to what it's all about, doesn't it? Making the wrong play at the right time. \nTHE KID (sharply) That's what it's all about? (then, as Lancey looks at him and doesn't answer) You were crazy -- odds are three hundred to one against. \nLANCEY (after a moment) I don't play a percentage game. I play stud poker my way. And I got the money and you got the questions. Figure that out. (then, not unkindly) You're good. But as long as I'm around, you're second best, Kid... and you might as well learn to live with it. \nThe Kid looks at him and doesn't answer. \nLANCEY Look me up if you're in Miami after Christmas. Stillson Hotel. \nHe smiles his very pleasant smile and goes out the door. \nSCENE \nLancey stops surrounded by a crowd of admirers offering their congratulations. The Kid watches for a moment then takes a long drink out of the bottle and eases through the crowd and out the door. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nas The Kid moves down the hall and enters the elevator. \nINT. LOBBY \nas he moves through the almost deserted lobby into the street. \nEXT. ST. LOUIS STREET - DAWN EFFECT \nSERIES OF ANGLES of the Kid walking alone through the city. During the above there is an impression someone is following him. \nEXT. DESERTED STREET NEAR THE KID'S APARTMENT \nHe turns a corner and there is a man blocking his path. Suddenly three men move in behind him. He turns, trapped. \nCLOSER ANGLE \nThe men are four of the original seven players he hustled in the opening scene. \nNOTE: During the progression of the game first one, then two, then all four men will be included among the observers. Always in the background, never positively identified. Their presence should be felt if not recognized. \nDANNY So it ain't Eric Stone, from the foundry. It's the Cincinnati Kid King of the stud poker players. \nTHE KID No -- not the King -- not much of anything right now. \nDANNY (moving towards him) We'll start with giving you back what you gave me. \nHe moves toward The Kid. \nCHRISTIAN (O.S.) Eric -- \nThe men hesitate. \nNEW ANGLE \nas Christian gets out of a taxi. \nDANNY (as she moves toward them) Tell her good-bye, sport. You ain't going any place. \nTHE KID I know that. \nHe crosses to Christian. \nCHRISTIAN Are you all right? \nCLOSER ANGLE \nTHE KID I'm fine. (then) Weren't you going to say good-bye? \nCHRISTIAN I said good-bye. \nTHE KID Yeah, I guess you did. (then) You don't know if I won or lost do you? \nCHRISTIAN No -- it doesn't really matter. (then after a long moment) I love you, Kid -- and it's not enough. \nTHE KID Yeah, I know. \n"}

We are now very close on Hi, staring. 
VOICE OVER ...when the last of the cons has been swept away by the sandman. 
HI'S POV 
The underside of the top bunk. 
A sudden flash whitens and fades to leave the image of Ed, smiling behind her camera, softly supered on the underside of the bunk. 
BACK TO HI 
He wearily turns his head to profile on the pillow and shuts his eyes. 
VOICE OVER But I couldn't help thinking that a brighter future lay ahead - a future that was only eight to fourteen months away. 
Eyes closed, he is illuminated by a flash. 
PAROLE BOARD ROOM 
Hi and the same three officers. 
CHAIRMAN Got a name for people like you, Hi. That name is called recidivism. 
SECOND MAN Ree-peat O-fender. 
CHAIRMAN Not a pretty name, is it, Hi? 
HI No Sir, it sure ain't. That's one bonehead name. But that ain't me anymore. 
CHAIRMAN You're not just tellin' us what we wanna hear? 
HI No Sir, no way. 
SECOND MAN 'Cause we just wanna hear the truth. 
HI Well then I guess I am tellin' you what you wanna hear. 
CHAIRMAN Boy, didn't we just tell you not to do that? 
HI Yessir. 
CHAIRMAN Okay then. 
TRACKING 
Over Hi's shoulder as he strides toward a door marked "Processing" and flings it open.

Hi cocks a finger at the suspect. 
HI Howdy Kurt. 
ED'S ROOM 
As she nervously frets at her white bridal gown in front of a mirror. 
VOICE OVER And so it was. 
SHERIFF (O.S.) Don't forget the boo-kay, Ed! 
CLOSE SHOT ED 
Gazing earnestly into the camera. A congregation is seated behind her - the bride's side wearing police blues; the groom's side, Hawaiian shirts. 
ED I do. 
CLOSE SHOT HI 
Also staring into the camera. 
HI You bet I do. 
REVERSE 
Over their shoulders, the minister. 
MINISTER Okay then. 
FLASH 
On the newlyweds smiling at the camera. 
FLASH 
On the newlyweds smiling at each other, profile to the camera. 
HIGH WIDE SHOT TRAILER PARK 
In the middle of a vast expanse of desert. 
VOICE OVER Ed's pa staked us to a starter home in suburban Tempe... 
INT. MACHINE SHOP 
Hi is working the drill press, wearing goggles and sweat- stained overalls. 
VOICE OVER ...and I got a job drilling holes in sheet metal. 
Next to him idly stands Bud, a veteran of the shop, with a grimy face and a pair of goggles pushed up on his forehead. 
BUD So we was doin' paramedical work in affiliation with the state highway system-not actually practicin', y'understand - and me and Bill's patrollin' down Nine Mile -

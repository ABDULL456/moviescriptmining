{"train": "TALL IN THE SADDLE \nWritten by \nMichael Hogan & Paul P Fix \nStory by \nGordon Ray Young \n1944 SHOOTING DRAFT \nEXT. GARDEN CITY STATION - DAY \nCLOSE SHOT -- station signboard. It reads: \n\"GARDEN CITY\" \nCAMERA PANS to show the dusty platform of a typical small Arizona town of the late nineties. \nCAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures, consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans and a mongrel dog. \nCAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his feet sleepily. \nMED. SHOT \nline of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. The sound of a distant train whistle is heard o.s. The dog, which up to now might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera. \nLONG SHOT \nrailway track with the three-car train approaching. \nMED. SHOT \nline of sleeping figures. The dog jumps up barking furiously and runs out of shot past camera. The sleeping figures come to life and look toward camera. At the same time, the door of the ticket office opens and the agent appears. \nFULL SHOT \nrailway track. The train is now almost at the station. \nEXT. PLATFORM - DAY \nFULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind Rocklin a conductor. \nMED. SHOT \nbaggage car. The baggageman is standing at the open door of the car with two sacks of mail. He drops them to the platform and waves to the conductor o.s. and begins to close the doors of the baggage car. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \non Station Agent and conductors. The latter signals the engineer. The train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's face. \nTRUCKING SHOT \nAs Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around uncertainly. \nSTATION AGENT (at office door) Expectin' someone? \nROCKLIN (after a second's pause) I guess not. Where's the stagecoach office? \nSTATION AGENT (pointing) Back of the depot. \nEXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY \nThe stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a sign -- \nRED ROCK STAGE \nJ. Harolday Proprietor \nRocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally. \nDAVE (to horse) Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that -- jus' lookit what you done -- (some more pantomime) I'm tellin' you, Blossom that -- (indicating broken bottle) -- makes you the most aggravatin' female as ever I had a despise fer -- I've got a good notion to pizen you -- an' what's more -- \nHe stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the bottle. \nDAVE (to Blossom) Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? -- (chuckles) Fooled myself, too. \nON ROCKLIN \nwho has been watching Dave's performance. He smiles his amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office. \nINT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY \nPAN SHOT. Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble- lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks on the counter and leaves. \nSTAGE AGENT (to Rocklin) Howdy. \nROCKLIN (indicating stage) That the stage for Santa Inez? \nSTAGE AGENT (nods) Leaving any minute. \nRocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad of bills, drops them on the counter. The Stage Agent counts out the fare. \nSTAGE AGENT Santa Inez -- seventeen-fifty -- (returning the balance) Name? \nROCKLIN Rocklin. \nThe Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket. Rocklin takes some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances outside. \nROCKLIN Mind if I ride alongside the driver? \nSTAGE AGENT (over his specs) It's all right with me -- if it's all right with Dave -- He's mad -- His last trip -- Had a row with Harolday, the boss -- Old-timer, Dave -- an' a grumpy old cuss. \nZEKE (holding out his arms) Dave! \nDAVE (letting out a yell and rushing to Zeke) Why, Zeke, you two-legged old coot! \nCLOSE SHOT \nZeke and Dave as they beat one another on the back. \nDAVE Whar you been all these months? \nZEKE Up in the hills workin' my way down the biggest hole you ever seed. \nDAVE Good -- What's at the bottom of it? \nZEKE Nothin'! \nDAVE (roaring with laughter) What, again!! \nMED. SHOT \nRocklin has entered and moved to the fire. Miss Martin and Clara enter and stand in the doorway watching the scene at the bar. A pale-faced, dyspeptic-looking man of about 45 (Stan) comes from the kitchen and approaches them ingratiatingly. \nSTAN Good evening, ladies. How about something to eat? \nMISS MARTIN (with a dubious look toward the pair at the bar) Well -- if it won't take too long. \nSTAN (leading the way toward the partition) This way, ladies. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nbar. Dave has just fitted a cylindrical record of \"She Was Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage\" to an old-type phonograph. \nDAVE Yep -- this is my last trip. \nZEKE Why? \nDAVE Old Harolday won't take back what he said. \nZEKE What'd he say? \nDAVE \"You're fired.\" \nThey both yell with laughter and slap one another on the back. \nMED. SHOT \nfrom fireplace. Rocklin is standing in f.g. looking down at the fire and making the inevitable cigarette from his pocket dip. Seated at the table are Clara and Miss Martin. From o.s. comes the sound of Zeke and Dave singing to the phonograph record. Miss Martin glares indignantly in the direction of the bar, obviously about to make a protest. At this moment Stan comes from the kitchen with a large dish in his hand which he dumps on the table. \nSTAN There you are, folks. Dig in and help y'rselves. \nMiss Martin, sitting forward eagerly, suddenly sees the dish of meat and freezes. \nCLOSE SHOT \ndish of meat. It is swimming in greasy brown gravy. \nMED. SHOT \nMiss Martin as she shudders dyspeptically and closes her eyes. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nbar, as Stan comes from the table to Dave and Zeke. \nSTAN Supper, Dave? \nDAVE (noisily) I'm drinkin' mine. Set 'em up. \nMED. SHOT \ntable. Clara has filled a plate with food, which she offers to her aunt. \nCLARA Auntie -- \nMISS MARTIN With my dyspepsia? Do you want to kill me? \nClara hesitates for a second, then looks across to Rocklin. \nCLARA Aren't you going to have any supper? \nROCKLIN Reckon so. \nHe comes to table and begins to help himself. There is a loud burst of laughter from the bar. \nMISS MARTIN Young man, that driver's had all the liquor he can take. \nROCKLIN Has he? \nMISS MARTIN You know he has. You're not a complete fool, are you? \nROCKLIN Frequently. \nMISS MARTIN (to Clara, furiously) The rudeness of people in these parts is appalling! \nClara looks apologetically at Rocklin, then away again nervously. Suddenly, she sees something o.s. and drops her knife and fork with a little start. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nwindow. A thin, unpleasant-looking face is seen through the glass. The windowpane is defective and so distorts the lower part of the face into a hideous smile. It is the younger of the two men who were watching the coach outside the hotel. \nPANNING SHOT \non kitchen door as Stan comes through with a dish of potatoes. A man's voice is heard o.s. and he pulls up abruptly. \nMISS MARTIN Hold your tongue. (to Zeke, who is gaping at her) And you -- stop staring as if we were monsters. \nZeke takes it and staggers into the b.g. near Bob Clews. \nDAVE (to Rocklin) Where's Stan? We got to have another drink. \nROCKLIN He's outside tryin' to explain away a hide. \nDAVE Eh? \nROCKLIN (indicating food) Seems we're eatin' stolen beef. \nDAVE Somebody's loco. Stan might have given house-room to bit o' dead beef, but he'd never be fool enough to leave the hide lyin' around. (to Zeke) How 'bout it, Zeke? \nZeke opens his mouth to speak, and slowly folds up, sliding down the wall to the floor. \nMED. SHOT \nas Clews comes from the fireplace and joins the group. \nBOB CLEWS That's the way it is, Dave. \nDave has gone to Zeke's aid and now peers at Clews closely, recognizing him for the first time. \nDAVE (disgustedly) Oh -- it's you. \nBOB CLEWS That's right -- your old pal Bob Clews. \nDAVE (shoves Clews) Git away from me -- you two-timin' horse thief. \nBOB CLEWS (grinning) Them's fightin' words, pardner. \nStan and Jackson come from the kitchen. Dave is again picking up Zeke, but seeing Stan, lets Zeke drop. \nDAVE (moving to Stan) Hey, Stan -- don't let 'em hang nothin' on you, you ain't done. They're just a couple of fourflushers -- the pair of 'em, everybody knows that. \nJackson addresses everyone present with an indulgent Smile. \nJACKSON Crazy drunk. \nDAVE (wheels on Jackson) Mebbe I am drunk -- mebbe that's why I'm tellin' the truth -- I'm drunk an' I'll say what I think -- I'll say what I know. \nZeke, on the floor, takes up Dave's belligerent mood for a flash. \nZEKE So will -- I -- (goes out again) \nJackson goes to Dave. \nJACKSON Don't act up this ways, Dave -- They's women watchin'. \nClews moves in to Jackson and Dave, and now both men urge Dave toward the door. \nDAVE (attempting to throw them off) Git your hands off me -- \nBOB CLEWS (to company in general) What he needs is a short lay-down. \nROCKLIN (taking a step forward) I'll lend a hand. \nJACKSON (brushing past him) Me an' Bob'll look after him. We're his friends -- come on, Bob. (as they steer Dave through door) Careful now -- don't hurt him. \nThey exit. Rocklin stands frowning a second, then turns toward the table where Stan is making a show of clearing dishes, etc. \nROCKLIN (quietly to Stan) How are things standin' now between you an' the law? (indicates direction Jackson went out) \nSTAN (not wanting to talk about it particularly) All right, I reckon -- (looks at Rocklin; more confidently) I guess this bill of sale -- (indicates it in Vest pocket) -- kinda winded him. \nRocklin's lips curl in a wise smile. \nROCKLIN Good thing you saved it. \nZeke is discovered on all fours crawling around on the floor near the table where the women sit. He seems to be looking for something. \nMISS MARTIN (mystified) What are you doing? \nZeke turns his hairy face up toward Miss Martin. \nZEKE Musta been dreamin' -- Thought I was sittin' on a pot of gold. \nSTAN (wearily) There ain't no gold here. \nZEKE (takes it) There ain't even a pot. \nThe door leading from the barn opens and Jackson enters followed by Clews a few steps behind. \nROCKLIN How is he? \nJACKSON Went to sleep soon's we laid him down. (pulling off hat again) Sorry to have a ruckus in front of you ladies. Dave's an ornery old cuss when he gets goin' -- No shape to drive on, I'm afraid. \nMISS MARTIN (this is a fine kettle of fish) Hmmm -- \nJACKSON Don't worry, ma'am. Bob, here, 'll take you on in -- knows every inch of the road -- Don't you? \nBOB CLEWS (grins) You bet. \nRocklin has been listening intently. \nROCKLIN I'm drivin'. \nCLOSE SHOT \nof the group, with Clews looking significantly at Jackson, who is obviously checkmated by Rocklin's remark. \nJACKSON (finally speaks) But if anything was to happen to the ladies, I'd feel -- to blame. \nCAMERA PANS to show Rocklin and Dave coming along the boardwalk in front of the saloon. CAMERA PANS them to the swing-doors, which Rocklin pushes open, passing through into the saloon. \nINT. SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nPANNING SHOT -- SHOOTING FROM BEHIND the bar toward the swing- doors as Dave and Rocklin enter. The bartender (Cap), a lean, tallish man of about 50, studies them as they enter, then turns and calls across the room. \nCAP Hey Doc! \nCAMERA PANS to show a group of poker players seated around a table. This consists of a well-dressed, powerful-looking man of about 45 (Judge Garvey), with a smooth face and an impressive manner; a flashily-dressed young man with a weak face (Clint Harolday); a tough-looking cowboy of about 35 (Ab Jenkins); a pleasant-faced storekeeper of about 50 (Pap Fossler); and a little man with a weather-beaten face and intensely blue eyes (Doc Riding). Watching the game are Sam Haynes and Shorty Davis, the former a townsman and the latter a cowboy. As they all look toward the door, Cap's voice continues. \nCAP'S VOICE Customer -- \nDoc Riding looks quickly toward the door, taking in the situation. \nDOC RIDING (to Haynes) Take my hand, Sammy. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nRocklin and Dave come to the bar. At the same time, Doc Riding comes into shot from the poker table. \nDOC RIDING What happened? \nROCKLIN Bumped his head. \nDOC RIDING (dryly) I see. (examining the head) Looks like he's going to need a couple or so stitches. (to Cap) Better get him upstairs. \nThe bartender looks dubious. \nROCKLIN (nodding) Okay. You can book me a room, too. \nAs Rocklin and Doc Riding begin to lead Dave toward the Stairs. \nDISSOLVE IN \nINT. DAVE'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nTRUCKING SHOT -- starting on big head of Dave, as he lies in bed, with his eyes closed. His head is swathed in a clean bandage. He stirs and gives a little chuckle. \nDAVE (muttering) No laigs. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to show Doc Riding at the bed and Rocklin beyond, standing in the connecting doorway between two bedrooms. The latter has a face towel in his hands and has evidently been washing up. As Dave settles down comfortably in the bed, Doc Riding closes his bag, nods to Rocklin and moves toward the second bedroom. \nINT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nMED. CLOSE SHOT -- as Doc Riding comes through the doorway from Dave's room. \nDOC RIDING He'll be all right in the morning. \nRocklin closes door behind him. \nDOC RIDING How about a snort? \nROCKLIN Don't mind if I do. \nHe moves across the room, followed by Rocklin, who throws the towel down on the bed as he passes. For a second, he hesitates as if about to pick up the gun-belt which is lying on the bed. Then, deciding to leave it, he follows the doctor through the door. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nMED. CLOSE SHOT -- at bar, with Cap Setting up glasses for Doc Riding and Rocklin. He nods to indicate the bedroom upstairs. \nCAP (with a grin) Will he make it? \nDOC RIDING Sure he'll make it. Can't kill off a salty old hairpin like Dave that easy. \nCAP You're right. Reckon Saint Peter must be gitten' mighty tired of dustin' off that doormat for him. (to Rocklin) By the way, how did you say it happened? \nROCKLIN (stolidly) I didn't. \nCAP (with a slight nod of approval) That's right; you didn't. (casually) Reason I ask is, a couple fellers was in saying how Dave was kickin' up a ruckus up at Stan's place. (to Doc Riding) Sheriff Jackson it was and one of the Clewses. \nDOC RIDING (with a look of distaste) Oh! \nCap reverts to Rocklin, still casually, but with an undertone of friendly warning. \nCAP Tough customers, the Clewses. \nDOC RIDING Yeah -- don't pay to start something with 'em you don't intend to finish. \nCAP (to Doc Riding before Rocklin can answer) By the way, Doc, they tell me George'll be out again. (to Rocklin, with the same casual air) That's Bob Clews' brother. Jest done a stretch in pen 'tentiary for horse stealin'. \nROCKLIN They string 'em up for that where I come from. \nDOC RIDING (muttering into his drink) Pity they didn't string him up while they wore about it. \nCAP That's what Arly Harolday was sayin' only this mornin'. (to Rocklin) You ain't met our Arly yet, I reckon? \nDOC RIDING He will, if he stays here long enough. (chuckles) \nCAP Hell-fire in skirts. \nDOC RIDING (raises his glass; grinning) Well, here's now. \nThey down the drinks. There is a burst of excited comment from o.s. and they all look around toward the poker table. \nMED. SHOT \nPoker table from bar. The flashily-dressed youngster is raking in the stakes triumphantly. \nCLINT What did I tell you? They gotta be big to beat me! \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nRocklin, his hands outspread, slowly straightens up, rises and backs away. At the foot of the stairs, he turns deliberately and walks upstairs. When he disappears from view -- \nCLINT - WITH OTHERS AT THE POKER TABLE \nClint breaks the tension, looking from one to the other. \nCLINT No man can run a bluff on me. \nThere is a cold silence. \nPAP (finally) He wasn't armed. \nCAP I don't like to tell men how to play cards unless I'm settin' in -- but I mebbe ought to have spoken up. (directly to Clint) That Queen was dead, Clint -- and you know it. \nCLINT (arrogantly) When anybody plays poker with me, they play my game or not at all. \nCAP You can't just go makin' your own rules, Clint -- (starts for the bar -- stops and turns) -- an' if I was you I'd hightail outa here before he comes back. \nCLINT (jolted) Comes back? \nCAP (wearily) He's the kind. \nCap turns and resumes his trek to the bar. Suddenly he stops before reaching it and is looking up, o.s. \nTHE TOP OF STAIRS FROM CAP'S ANGLE \nRocklin is standing there grimly surveying the situation. As he starts down the stairs... \nTHE GROUP AROUND THE POKER TABLE \nThey are staring o.s. Clint is very uneasy. And now Rocklin moves slowly into the scene. \nROCKLIN (with deadly calm) I've come for my money. \nCLINT (nervously pleasant) It's all yours, mister -- Cap, there -- Cap is an old gambler -- he says you were right all the time. \nClint again looks around for approval, but gets no response. Rocklin comes slowly forward, picks up the money from the table and turns back to the stairs. As he reaches the foot of the stairs, he turns and looks straight at Garvey with a peculiar expression. \nROCKLIN By the way, Judge -- the name is Rocklin. \nFADE OUT \nINT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nTRUCKING SHOT -- on a small cracked mirror in which can be seen the reflection of a man shaving. A voice is heard singing, atrociously off key. \nSINGER'S VOICE She was only a bird in a gilded cage... (etc.) \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to show that the owner of tie voice is Rocklin, who has almost finished shaving. As he scrapes his chin and whistles, peering at himself in the little cracked mirror, he hears the sound of the door opening and turns, then ducks quickly as a boot flies past him, just missing the mirror. There is the sound of the door slamming and Rocklin grins. He picks up the boot and goes to the door leading to Dave's room. \nINT. DAVE'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nAs Rocklin enters, Dave is discovered almost dressed sitting on the bed. Rocklin, glad to see him, smiles and tosses the boot to him. \nROCKLIN How you feelin'? \nDAVE After that singin'? -- Thirsty. (pulls on his boot) \nROCKLIN How's your head? \nDAVE (evidently not aware of what happened) Oh -- a mite hungover -- but I'll feel better once I git downstairs. \nHe hurries out the hall door. Rocklin, amused at the old coot, starts back into his room. \nINT. ROCKLIN'S BEDROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nRocklin is just coming through the door and sees something o.s., stops and freezes. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Bob Clews leaning against the open ball door leading into Rocklin's room. He smiles as Rocklin sees him. \nBOB CLEWS I knocked, but guess you didn't hear me. \nROCKLIN (closing door to Dave's room) What do you want? \nBOB CLEWS (grinning) Looks like you stirred things up around here last night, stranger. \nROCKLIN That all you came to say? \nBOB CLEWS No. I got a message for you. (getting no response) From Old Man Harolday. Wants to see you out front. \nROCKLIN What about? \nBOB CLEWS Maybe he wants to thank you for teaching that pup of his a lesson. \nROCKLIN (after a second) I'll be down. \nClews hesitates for a second as if anxious to wake sure he is coming, then, turning, he disappears into the hall. Rocklin wipes the last of the lather off his chin, buckles on his gun-belt and picking up his hat goes out, closing the door. \nINT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nMED. SHOT -- Dave, at the bar, grabbing a bottle, pours himself a drink which he sinks in one draught. He shudders and repeats the dose. During this, an excited murmur of voices has been heard o.s. Dave turns and looks toward the far side of the saloon and suddenly gapes. \nMED. SHOT - FROM THE BAR \nwith Dave in f.g., and SHOOTING TOWARD the street. A group of men, including Cap, the bartender, is gathered round the window looking out into the street. Dave staggers across to them and begins to push his way to the window. \nMED. SHOT \ngroup at window as Dave pushes them aside to get a view of what is happening outside. \nDAVE What's goin' on here? \nPAP FOSSLER Arly Harolday's on the warpath. \nROCKLIN Don't I? (indicating whiskey with a sickly grin) Why d'you think I need this? \nHe sinks the whiskey and begins to pour himself another. At the same time, the swing-doors open and Bob Clews comes through. AS Rocklin raises the glass to his lips, Bob Clews hits him on the back, causing him to spill the whisky. \nBOB CLEWS Funniest sight I ever seen. \nThere is a moment's pause. Then with a slow, grim smile of satisfaction, Rocklin turns and knocks Bob Clews off his feet. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nwith Bob Clews on the floor, tugging at his gun. As it comes free of the holster, Rocklin brings his heel down on Clews' wrist, grinding on it with his whole weights. Then, kicking the gun out of reach, Rocklin steps back. Bob Clews sits up, clutching his wrist and weaving back and forth. \nBOB CLEWS (moaning) You broke it! You broke it! \nROCKLIN Try another trick like that on me and it'll be worse. \nBOB CLEWS I never played you no trick. You broke my wrist. \nWIDER ANGLE \nto include the bystanders. They look at Bob Clews without sympathy. He gets to his feet and stumbles back, collapsing in a chair. \nCLOSE SHOT \nat bar, Dave has taken the bottle from Cap and is refilling Rocklin's and his own glass ecstatically. \nDAVE (gurgling with delight) Oh boy -- has somebody come to town! \nHe sinks both drinks quickly and is about to refill them when Cap takes the bottle from him. \nROCKLIN (to Cap) Where'll I find Judge Garvey? \nCAP He rooms behind his office down the street. Don't usually pull up the blinds till around noon, though. \nROCKLIN (putting down money) He will this morning. (to Dave) See you later, old-timer... \nAs he moves toward the door. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nClint Harolday is seen at the window peering furtively toward the Sun-Up Saloon. He suddenly notices something o.s. which prompts him to say something which we of course cannot hear. Now Garvey appears at the window. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY \nRocklin, FROM Garvey's ANGLE as he leaves the Sun-Up and starts toward the Judge's office. \nEXT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nGarvey and Clint, at the window. From their expressions it is apparent that anxious words are passing between them, and now Clint suddenly drops from sight. \nROCKLIN APPROACHES - LOOKS THE PLACE OVER - AND ENTERS \nEXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY \nON Arly and Juan, mounted. They see Rocklin going into Garvey's place. \nINT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nMED. SHOT -- TOWARD door, with Garvey at desk in f.g. The door opens and Rocklin enters. \nGARVEY (effusively) Oh, come in, Mr. Rocklin. Come right in. \nRocklin looks him over for a second, then comes quietly to the desk. \nROCKLIN I understand you were Red Caldwell's lawyer? \nGARVEY (immediately on guard) I was. \nROCKLIN Know anything about this? \nHe takes out a letter and hands it to Garvey. The latter takes it slowly, handling it as if it were dangerous. He looks from the letter to Rocklin and back again. Then reluctantly, he opens it and begins to read. \nLETTER -- It reads: \nDear Mr. Rocklin: \nGlad you have made up your mind to take the job. Enclosed find train fare and $150 advance on wages. \nYours faithfully, \nJ. Caldwell \nMED. SHOT \nRocklin and Garvey. The latter looks up from the letter completely bewildered. \nGARVEY I don't understand. Job? What job? \nROCKLIN Foreman. \nGARVEY (gaping) On the \"K.C.\"? (trying to take it in) But -- but why should he want you? \nROCKLIN Why not? Good foremen don't grow on bushes. \nThere is a little pause, with Garvey still bewildered. \nGARVEY (thinking hard) Is that your only motive for coming here? \nROCKLIN What other motive could I have? \nGARVEY I don't know -- It's just that Red Caldwell was a peculiar man -- had a funny way of doing things. \nMED. SHOT -- Harolday watching from behind the window of his office. Behind Harolday are Julio and Arly. The latter makes a step as if about to move to the door, but Julio restrains her. \nINT.

Rocklin's thumbs are hooked in his belt as he continues slowly forward, his eyes fixed on George's. \nROCKLIN (quietly) Draw a gun and I'll kill you. \nMED. SHOT \nGeorge, as he stands bewildered and open- mouthed. Rocklin enters scene, suddenly whips out his gun and brings it crashing down alongside George's head. The barrel strikes though the crown of his hat and he goes down like a pole- axed steer. \nINT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY \nMED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window. Arly gives an involuntary exclamation of pleasure, which she instantly checks, then she moves abruptly out of shot, followed by Juan. Harolday continues to stare frowningly out of the window. \nINT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nMED. CLOSE SHOT -- group at window, with Garvey obviously disapponted, Miss Martin bridling and Clara showing obvious relief. \nEXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nMED. SHOT -- Rocklin and crowd as they swirl around him offering congratulations. Dave pushes his way through the crowd and thumps Rocklin on the back in wild enthusiasm. At the same time, the sound of a horse cantering is heard, and Jackson comes into shot. \nJACKSON (to Rocklin) Hey, you! What's this you been up to? \nROCKLIN I just laid a gun barrel over the head of a drunk friend of yours -- same as you did over Dave's here yesterday. \nDAVE (surprised) Eh? \nJACKSON (blustering) I don't know what you're talking about. \nROCKLIN (calmly) You're a liar! \nHe turns contemptuously and begins to move back towards the stage office completely ignoring Jackson, who rides alongside blusteringly. \nJACKSON Now you lookee here, young feller. You go on talking that way and you'll find yourself in trouble. \nThe crowd which has been following now begins to razz him openly. He turns and glares, but without effect. He gives a final shout to Rocklin. \nJACKSON Don't say you ain't been warned. \nPulling his horse around, he sets off in a lope up the street. \nMED. SHOT \nas Miss Martin comes along the street, determinedly, followed by Clara, until she is face to face with Rocklin outside the stage office where Arly and Juan are mounted ready to move off. \nMISS MARTIN (ignoring everyone but Rocklin) I saw you. I saw you strike that poor man. \nROCKLIN Yes, ma'am. As hard as I could. \nMISS MARTIN You ruffian, you! \nClara pulls her sleeve imploringly. \nMISS MARTIN Let me go! (to Rocklin) I knew the sort you were the moment I set eyes on you. You can't fool me! You're nothing but a common adventurer! Come, Clara! \nShe takes Clara by the arm and sweeps past them towards the hotel. Rocklin looks after them with a grim expression and then up at Arly, who has been listening intently. She returns his look steadily for a second. Then, with a mocking smile, she wheels the mare and canters out of shot, followed by Juan. He looks after her for a second; then with the same grim look, enters Harolday's office. \nINT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY \nHarolday is standing at the window, looking toward the door, having seen Rocklin approaching. The door opens and Rocklin enters and resumes his conversation as though it were hardly interrupted. \nROCKLIN -- Now what was that you were sayin' about Caldwell? \nHAROLDAY You being hired by Red Caldwell only confirms what I'd suspected -- he was getting ready to fight. \nROCKLIN (trying to get information) Fight? Who? \nHAROLDAY Organized rustling. Well at least -- that's my belief. Red was no friend of mine. Too fond of taking the law into his own hands. But he had my sympathy. He'd been harder hit than any of us. And on top of it all, he lost his foreman. \nROCKLIN You mean, he quit on him? \nHAROLDAY He was shot -- in the back -- with a bullet from the same caliber rifle as got Red. \nROCKLIN Got any ideas? \nHAROLDAY No -- Except that the man you just pistol-whipped is in on it somewhere. (bitterly) Pity you didn't kill him when you had the chance. \nRocklin realizes that maybe Harolday is trying to throw a curve -- trying to get him to talk. \nROCKLIN Say -- it don't sound as if it's goin' to be too easy for them wimmen at the K.C. \nHAROLDAY (watching him keenly) Want to go back and work for them? \nROCKLIN No, sir. And I ain't jumping at this offer o' yours either because I don't hold with working for wimmen. \nHAROLDAY (quickly) Oh, you mean my step-daughter. Well don't worry. She won't interfere with you...Rocklin -- I figure we've been losin' cattle over a place called Table Top -- it's the back way into the Topaz Ranch and the perfect route for rustlers -- I'm going to send you up to the line camp -- you don't mind working a lone hand -- do you? \nROCKLIN (measuring) -- I like workin' that way. \nHAROLDAY (rising and holding out a hand) Good -- be ready to move out this afternoon. \nDISSOLVE \nARLY (over her shoulder to Rocklin) Juan'll show you the bunkhouse. I'll talk to you about your duties in the morning. \nBefore Rocklin can speak, she runs quickly up the steps of the verandah and disappears into the house. Leading Arly's Horse, Juan moves out of shot to the left of the ranch house and Rocklin follows. \nEXT. CORRAL - SANTEE RANCH - LATE AFTERNOON \nMED. SHOT -- as Juan comes into shot leading the mare, followed by Rocklin. They both dismount and begin to off- saddle. \nROCKLIN How far is the line-camp at Table- Top? \nJUAN Twenty-five -- thirty mile. \nROCKLIN I'm moving out there first thing in the morning. (as Juan turns and stares) Boss' orders. Care to show me the way? \nThere is a moment's pause. Then, what almost amounts to a smile of relief, crosses Juan's face. \nJUAN I will show you. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. SANTEE RANCH - DAY \nLONG SHOT -- as Rocklin and Juan ride out from the ranch through the early morning mist and turn off in the direction of the distant line of mountains. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. ENTRANCE TO CANYON - DAY \nLONG SHOT -- as the two leave the open country and enter the mouth of a steep and narrow gorge at the foot of the mountain range. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \nas Juan pulls up and dismounts, followed by Rocklin. \nJUAN (pointing ahead) The trail is straight ahead. You will find the cabin at the top. (turning back to his horse) Adios, Senor. \nROCKLIN (challenging, but perfectly friendly) Senor Romerez, it appears that you do not like me. \nFor a second Juan does not reply. Then, as he speaks, he takes a tobacco pouch from his pocket. Rocklin, his mind on other things, does not take particular notice of the pouch, but we cannot help notice the pouch ornament -- a steer's head of hammered silver. \nJUAN (during the above business) Senor, that is true. I do not like you. \nROCKLIN Why? \nJUAN (extending the pouch) Permit that I offer you a cigarette. \nRocklin shakes his head. Juan, having spilled tobacco in a paper, now puts away the pouch and rolls his own. \nJUAN It is not your fault that your shadow is black. But you will only bring unhappiness to my senorita. I do not blame you, but I fear I must hate you. \nHe turns abruptly and mounts the waiting horse; then looks down from the saddle. \nJUAN Adios, Senor. \nHe rides quickly out of the shot. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. TABLE-TOP - DAY \nMED. SHOT -- as Rocklin forces his horse up the last few feet of the steep trail at the top of the canyon, and pulls up at the top of the rise with a look of amazement. \nFULL SHOT - FROM ROCKLIN'S ANGLE \nA rich meadow stretches ahead with a stream running through it, and a cabin at the far end. Steep escarpments surround the lush meadow land, making an idyllic scene. As Rocklin comes slowly into shot with the same look of startled appreciation on his face and begins to move toward the cabin, \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. APPROACH TO SANTEE RANCH - DAY \nLONG SHOT -- of Juan, as he canters across open country toward the ranch. \nCAMERA PANS to include the road from Santa Inez along which approaches a smallish freight wagon, pulled by two horses. As the driver sees Juan and waves his whip, the Mexican swerves from his course and canters toward the wagon. \nMED. SHOT \nwagon, which we now see is being driven by Dave. On the side of the wagon is written: TRANSPORT & GENERAL FREIGHTAGE -- Pap Fossler and Sons. Juan canters into shot and pulls up alongside the wagon. \nDAVE Hiya there. \nJUAN Buenos dias, Senor Dave. (looking at name on wagon) You have found new employer, eh? \nDAVE Yeah. Haulin' freight for ole Pap Fossler. Got a letter here for that crazy galoot, Rocklin. (with a little Wink) From the little Caldwell girl. Seems mighty took up about sumpin'. Made me promise to deliver it personal. (indicates letter) \nJUAN But Senor Rocklin is not here. \nDAVE Lordy -- he ain't quit already... \nJUAN (shakes head) I have just accompany him to Table- Top. \nDISSOLVE IN \nEXT. TOPAZ RANCH HOUSE - DAY \nShelley, a Negro servant of the Harolday household, is discovered sweeping the front porch. Behind him we see Clint open the door -- peer furtively out -- then cross the porch to its edge when he looks o.s. as though searching for someone. \nShelley, meantime, has noticed Clint, but goes right on with his sweeping. His only reaction is a disparaging glance over his shoulder. \nCLINT (turning to Shelley) Have you seen Arly? \nSHELLEY No, suh, Ah didn't see Miss Arly today, but Ah seed her las' night, and she shore was mad. \nTo emphasize his point, Shelley puckers his mouth in a whistle. \nARLY How do you know that? \nTALA I have just now met Dave, and he tell me. -- So now he rides to Table Top. \nArly is quiet a moment. \nTALA Little one you -- \nARLY (quickly, as she starts for the house) Oh, leave me alone. \nLONG SHOT \nentrance to ranch. Entering the driveway from the direction of Santa Inez, comes Harolday, still looking the distinguished citizen. \nHAROLDAY RIDES UP TO THE PORCH - CLOSE TO ARLY AND JULIO \nHAROLDAY Good morning, Julio -- morning Arly. (to Julio as he dismounts) Fetch my briefcase -- it's on my desk. \nJulio exits. \nHAROLDAY TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO ARLY WHO \nstill smarting under the disappointment about Rocklin, seems lost in thought. After regarding her a moment Harolday speaks. \nHAROLDAY Looks like we're going to get that land we've been wanting along the river bottom. \nArly turns her eyes on Harolday, who continues. \nHAROLDAY I didn't tell you -- but I bought the mortgage on the Hardman ranch, and it's due today -- On my way over there now. \nArly's eyes burn as she tosses her head slightly. \nARLY Did you send that Rocklin to Table- Top? \nHAROLDAY I did. \nARLY (furiously) Well, let's get things straight. This place was my mother's -- now it's mine and Clint's -- It's true you've been helping out -- but the way things are going we'll soon be able to pay you back every penny we owe. Meanwhile, I'm running this outfit and I expect to give the orders. \nHAROLDAY You generally do. \nARLY Why did you send Rocklin up to Table- Top? \nHAROLDAY It seemed to me a good idea -- what with all this rustling going on -- \nARLY Who'd ever try driving cattle over Table-Top? -- Unless they were crazy. \nHAROLDAY (coldly) I don't agree with you. In any case -- if you must have it -- I'd no intention of engaging a man at foreman's wages just to gratify the whims of a jealous woman! \nARLY (dangerously) You take care what you're saying. \nHAROLDAY (very controlled) It's you should take care, my dear. I'm afraid there's one man you can't rawhide into jumping the way you want. You've made a fool of yourself over him once. Better watch out you don't do it again. \nHe turns abruptly and walks off the verandah. \nMED. SHOT \nas Harolday comes from the verandah to his horse. Juan is standing there with the briefcase which Harolday takes with a yank, mounts his horse and rides out. \nThe CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE on Arly, who stands in furious silence watching Harolday ride away. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. CANYON ROAD ON THE WAY TO TABLE-TOP - DUSK \nOld Dave is jogging along in his wagon. A rumble of thunder echoes through the canyon. Dave reacts with a look toward the sky. \nSHOT \nof storm clouds gathering. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. MOUNTAIN ROAD NEAR TABLE-TOP - DUSK \nA night shot of the mountain road near Table-Top. It is a wooded section of the plateau, and occasional flashes of lightning illuminate the big trees skirting the road. Dave, in his wagon, looms out of the b.g., and as he nears the camera we hear him urging the team through the downpour. As he passes and continues hurriedly on his way, we \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nINT. CABIN - NIGHT \nCLOSE SHOT on a soiled and wrinkled envelope lying on a table. It is addressed to: \nMr. Rocklin c/o Santee Ranch \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK and Rocklin is revealed at the table, looking down at the letter. His hat is tipped back on his head, and his sleeves are rolled up. He is mixing dough in a bowl sitting on the table near the letter, and his hands are all gooey. Dave is discovered in front of the fireplace where his outer shirt and socks are drying. It is dark outside, but the storm has abated. Rocklin goes to a shelf near the fireplace to get a pan. \nDAVE (during the above) Durn funny -- that storm quittin' just about the time I get here. \nROCKLIN No funnier than you sloggin' through it, just to deliver a letter from a woman. \nDAVE (disgustedly) Reckon I'm gettin' to be more of a fool the older I get. \nDave watches Rocklin at the table shaping the dough for biscuits and putting it in the pan. \nDAVE When are we gonna get around to readin' it? \nRocklin cannot help smiling a bit at the way Dave includes himself in. \nROCKLIN Thought I'd wait till mornin' -- might be bad news an' I wouldn't be able to sleep. \nDAVE Well, now that's just what I asked -- but all he said, was that it belonged to a good friend. Then he said he wasn't waitin' fer the next coach, but was ridin' over to see the district judge about it alone. \nROCKLIN That's when they got him. \nDAVE Yes, sir -- 'bout a mile or so from Stan's place. A bullet in the back an' his pockets empty. \nROCKLIN How come you never told this before? \nDAVE Who was there to tell? -- Sheriff Jackson? -- Him an' Garvey's thick as thieves. \nROCKLIN How about what's his name -- Harolday? -- He's no friend of the Judge's, is he? \nDAVE Hates his guts -- sure riles him to see young Clint hangin' onto the Judge's coattails. All the same, I jus' decided to keep my mouth shut and my eyes open. \nROCKLIN (after a pause) Even if it was Garvey Red was talkin' about -- it don't follow that he killed him. \nDAVE No -- general opinion is that it was rustlers. \nROCKLIN Why would rustlers take the evidence Caldwell had with him? \nRocklin moves away to a large earthen jug holding water as Dave talks. \nDAVE Looks to me if you get the man who owned the marked cards, you get the killer. \nROCKLIN (drinking) Funny tho' -- first the K.C. foreman -- then Caldwell -- an' now these women. \nDAVE Lordy -- you ain't thinkin' somebody might try bumpin' them? \nROCKLIN (slowly, to himself) I'm not so sure somebody hasn't tried already -- (to Dave) Remember, when we stopped to change horses on the way Over from Garden City -- \nDAVE Shore -- you told me how Jackson and Clews tried to frame Stan. \nROCKLIN (nods) Yeah. Like they wanted to be sure he'd keep his mouth shut about something. \nDave sits down on a box sitting against the wall, directly under the large earthen jug of water. \nDAVE And layin' that gun across my skull -- an' offerin' to drive the coach themselves. \nA SECTION OF THE CLEARING - MOONLIGHT \nA dark, mysterious figure on a horse raises his rifle -- \nINT. OF CABIN - NIGHT \nSHOT. \nROCKLIN (nods) It was almost as if -- \nA shot splinters the windowpane and shatters the earthen jug on the shelf directly above Dave's head. The contents pour down on Dave and he topples over. Rocklin meanwhile has wiped the lantern off the table and ducked. They are both on the floor in the faint glow coming from the fireplace. \nROCKLIN (going to Dave) You all right? \nDAVE (blustering) Will be if I ever get dry. \nRocklin takes off his hat and puts his finger through two holes drilled by the bullet. \nROCKLIN Lookit that -- \nDAVE Good Lord -- \nRocklin puts the hat aside -- crawls over to his gun belt -- straps it on. \nROCKLIN Come on -- \nHe opens the door cautiously. Then sneaks out, followed by Dave. \nEXT. OF CABIN - MOONLIGHT - AFTER THE STORM \nRocklin and Dave stand close to the cabin, just clear of the door, tensely scanning the surrounding darkness. \nWater can be heard dripping from the cabin roof, and an owl hoots in a near-by tree. \nThe sound of neighing horses comes from the direction of the corral. Both men re-act. \nDAVE My team. \nAlmost immediately the neighing is repeated, but this time from another direction entirely -- and from a distance. \nROCKLIN That's not your team. \nHe moves to the corner of the cabin, followed by Dave. \nHORSE IS STOMPING NERVOUSLY \nand now it starts away, galloping through the deep grass at the edge of the clearing. Only the lower part of the animal is seen, along with the legs of the rider. \nROCKLIN AND DAVE HEAR THE SOUND OF RETREATING HOOF BEATS \nAnd they can barely make out their quarry riding hell-bent toward the deep blackness of the trees. \nRocklin fires and runs out into the moonlight in the clearing -- Dave close behind. \nRocklin halts -- fires again -- and again. Dave fires. \nThe mysterious rider is now swallowed by the night. \nDave starts after him again. Looking back, he sees Rocklin has not moved. \nDAVE Come on -- \nROCKLIN No use -- he's gone. \nDAVE Mebbe we winged him. \nDAVE (glancing back to the cabin) Fer a man who's got a despise fer wimmin, you sure do get all snaggled up with 'em. \nINT. OF CABIN - NIGHT \nArly, her back to us, is standing in the open doorway watching the two headed for the corral. \nHer mood is evidenced by the manner in which she suddenly slams shut the door. As she turns and leans against it, we see tears in her eyes, and hear suppressed sobs. Her eyes light on the bits of torn letter, and presently we see her face set itself grimly, and now she walks toward the fireplace and, passing the torn bite of paper, kicks at them viciously. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY \nLONG SHOT -- of Rocklin as he comes riding into town. As he nears the corner where the stage and Harolday's office is situated, the CAMERA MOVES IN, getting Rocklin and one of the Harolday employees repairing the wooden sidewalk near the hitching rail. \nROCKLIN (as he dismounts) You work for Harolday? \nThe man nods. \nROCKLIN Here's one of his horses -- I'll pick up my saddle later. \nHe enters the building. \nINT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY \nPANNING SHOT on Harolday as he sits at the desk working on a ledger. The sound of a door opening is heard. Harolday looks up casually as if expecting a customer, then suddenly gapes. CAMERA PANS to include doorway in which stands Rocklin. \nROCKLIN Howdy... \nHAROLDAY (frowning) I thought I sent you up to Table- Top. \nROCKLIN That's right. \nHAROLDAY (slowly) What happened? \nROCKLIN (taking off his hat) Well, this, for one thing. \nHe pokes a finger through the hole in the crown. Harolday's eyes narrow. \nHAROLDAY (after a little pause) I told you you'd regret letting that rat Clews off so easy. \nRocklin looks at him with a queer expression without replying. \nHAROLDAY What's the matter? Don't you think it was him, then? \nROCKLIN (slowly) I been figgerin'. Don't seem reasonable Clews was in condition to take that sort of chance alone... Besides -- how could he have known I was up there -- that soon. And -- George Clews ain't the only one I've run contrariwise to in this town. There's that Mexican, for instance. \nHAROLDAY Juan? \nROCKLIN He as good as told me yesterday that him and me was due for a run-in one of those days. (suddenly nodding toward window) And then there's him! \nHarolday looks sharply toward the window. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY \nMED. SHOT from office window. Clint is hurrying across from the direction of the Sun-Up Saloon toward the office. \nINT. OUTER STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY \nPANNING SHOT on Clint as he enters from street and crosses to the door of Harolday's office. \nINT. HAROLDAY'S OFFICE - DAY \nMED. SHOT on door of inner office with Harolday at desk in f.g. As the door opens it conceals Rocklin from Clint. \nCLINT (excitedly) I just heard that -- that Rocklin was -- (sees Rocklin) \nROCKLIN (slowly) Was what? \nCLINT (subdued) Was shot at last night. \nHAROLDAY (very calm) Mr. Rocklin was just telling me all about it. (significantly) Any idea who might have done it? \nClint looks quickly at Harolday and back at Rocklin with frightened eyes. \nCLINT Not me. \nRocklin makes no reply. \nCLINT You ain't trying to pin it on me? (his courage returning) 'Cause if you are, you're in for a big disappointment. I was over at the Sun-Up playing poker with the Judge and the rest of the boys till early morning. If you don't believe me, ask for yourself. \nROCKLIN (after a pause) All right. I believe you. But that don't mean you couldn't tell a thing or two as would help -- if you wanted. \nCLINT (very nervous again) What d'you mean? \nHAROLDAY (sharply) Yes. What sort of thing would Clint here know about, that would help identify the man who tried to kill you last night? \nROCKLIN This for one. \nHe pulls out the tobacco pouch which Dave found at Table- Top. \nROCKLIN Ever seen it before? \nCLOSE SHOT \nClint as he stares wide-eyed at the pouch. \nMED. SHOT \ngroup, with Rocklin and Harolday both watching Clint intently. \nHAROLDAY (harshly) Well, go on -- speak up. Did you ever see it before? \nROCKLIN'S VOICE I came for that letter. \nMiss Martin reacts. \nINT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nSHOT -- Garvey and Rocklin. \nGARVEY (calmly) Did you say letter? \nROCKLIN That's right -- the one Miss Caldwell's aunt wrote from out east sayin' she was of age. Remember? \nGARVEY No -- I'm afraid I don't. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nSHOT -- door. Miss Martin reacts with nod of satisfaction and leaves. \nINT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nRocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer marked \"C.\" As he fingers through the papers, Garvey sits back in his chair, watching. \nGARVEY What is your interest in this letter? \nROCKLIN My only interest is getting' it. \nGARVEY You realize what this is, don't you? -- Robbing -- armed robbery at that. \nRocklin pulls open the \"M\" drawer. \nGARVEY I warn you, you're in for a disappointment. \nNot finding the letter in the \"M\" drawer, Rocklin goes to the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers. It is locked. \nROCKLIN Open up. \nGARVEY (has had about enough) Listens, you -- (suddenly controls himself) There's nothing in there that'd interest you. \nROCKLIN (grimly) I'd like to make up my own mind about that. \nGARVEY (forces a chuckle) All right -- I'll open it -- just to convince you I'm not hiding any letter. \nGarvey unlocks the drawer and opens it. It is found to contain nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards. \nThe UNOPENED DECKS OF CARDS. \nBACK TO SCENE. Garvey seems a little too anxious to close the drawer, and before he can do so, Rocklin has one hand inside. Garvey, checked for a second, looks up at Rocklin. \nGARVEY What's the idea? \nRocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks. \nROCKLIN These cards -- \nGARVEY (attempting to bluff it out) Anything wrong in a man having cards in his possession? \nROCKLIN Depends on what kind they are -- 'specially when they're under lock and key. \nThe two regard each other silently a moment. Now Rocklin casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket. \nGARVEY (too politely) You're taking those, I presume. \nROCKLIN That's right. \nHe takes a step away. Garvey turns him by touching his arm. \nGARVEY (has had almost enough) Now, you look here -- \nROCKLIN (soberly) You're the one who better start lookin' -- lookin' for a way out for killin' Red Caldwell. \nGARVEY (blanches) Caldwell -- \nROCKLIN (takes up one of the decks of cards) He found out about these -- and you went and killed him. \nGARVEY (with an affected smile and unnatural calmness) And you believe a story like that? \nROCKLIN I will until I hear a better one. (puts deck he holds, in his pocket) I'll just take this along -- the district judge at Garden City should be mighty interested. \nHe starts around the desk toward the door. From the corner of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle drawer. Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove. \nRocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury. The chair crashes against a window. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers- by, as well as Miss Martin seated in her surrey with Sammy, the K.C. China-boy. \nINT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe two are now fighting in earnest. \nVARIOUS FLASHES \nof the fight, intercut with townspeople gathering outside. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nDave pulls up in his wagon. \nINT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nIt is pretty well wrecked. Rocklin has Garvey just about done in. He gives him one final Sunday punch and Garvey goes down and stays down. At that moment, Dave and Pap Fossler enter followed by other curious natives. \nDAVE Say -- looks like you two been disagreein' 'bout somethin' -- (to Fossler, who has gone over to Garvey) He ain't daid, is he? \nwindow. The hand of the killer pitches the gun toward Rocklin and disappears. \nINT. BAR - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nLined up at the bar are Dave, Pap Fossler, Shorty Davis and a few others. Cap is in his usual place. At the poker table are Doc Riding, Sam Haynes, Ab Jenkins and one or two others. \nThe shot has evidently been heard, for everything seems to have stopped, and Dave and Pap Fussier are looking up toward the ceiling, as are others. Now Dave snaps back to life -- gulps down his drink, and hurries toward the stairs. As he starts up, the others move slowly in the same direction. \nINT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nRocklin is on the floor, groggy. He shakes his head, and as his senses return, he picks up the gun and just gets to his feet as Dave rushes in. \nDave sees Clint's body on the floor -- notices the gun in Rocklin's hand. He opens his mouth to speak but nothing comes out. All he can do is stare and grimace. The sound of hurrying feet comes from the hall, and presently the mob closes in, crowding the room and the hall. \nPap Fossler, who has been one of the first to enter, kneels over Clint. \nDuring this, there are general ad libs from the crowd. \nAD LIBS What happened? Who is it? Clint Harolday -- Etc. \nPAP FOSSLER Where's Doc Riding? \nAD LIBS Get the Doc. Hey, Doc -- He was down below. Here he is. \nDoc's voice is heard from the hall as he makes his way through the jam. \nDOC RIDING'S VOICE Here I am -- \nAD LIBS Look out, men -- Let the Doc through. Etc. \nDoc riding comes through the crowd, kneels beside Pap Fossler. He needs only a glance to know he can be of no use. \nDOC RIDING (breaking the silence) Somebody better fetch Harolday. \nCAP Shorty's already gone for him. \nPAP FOSSLER (getting up) Better get Arly, too. \nA voice is heard from the hall. \nVOICE She was at the hotel a while ago. \nPAP FOSSLER (looking down at Clint and shaking his head) He was only a kid. \nCLOSE SHOT \nRocklin, still holding his gun as he stares down at Clint's body o.s. Now he studies the faces of the mob. \nPANNING SHOT \nof the crowd. There is nothing but a sea of hostile faces. \nJACKSON'S VOICE What's goin' on here -- gang way -- \nThe crowd parts to admit Jackson, who comes stalking in followed by Judge Garvey. \nJACKSON What's the trouble here -- \nHe stops abruptly as he sees Clint's body. Now he levels his eyes on Rocklin. \nJACKSON (with a bitter smile) I warned you, didn't I? -- Well, I guess this is the last trouble you'll ever make in this town. (extending his hand) Hand over that gun. \nROCKLIN Just a minute, now -- \nHe steps back so no one is behind him. And there is something about his manner and tone that urges Jackson to use discretion. \nROCKLIN (to the crowd, generally) I know it looks bad -- but I didn't kill the kid. \nThe crowd stares in skeptical silence. Even Dave thinks Rocklin is lying, and now does his best to protect his friend. \nDAVE I believe you. (to the others) His gun was layin' over there on the floor when I come in and -- \nROCKLIN (cutting in) No it wasn't -- It was right in my hand -- like it is now. \nDave winces. \nJACKSON If you didn't know him -- then who did? \nROCKLIN I don't know -- (looks at garvey) But I'm going to find out. \nINT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nHarolday, followed by Shorty Davis, is making his way down the hall from the inner stair landing. As he nears the crowd gathered at Rocklin's door, Juan comes into view down the hall, having just entered through the door leading out onto the verandah. \nHAROLDAY (as he nears Rocklin's door) Where is he? -- Where's my boy? \nINT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nHarolday enters, over the ad libs of the mob, followed by Shorty Davis. During the following action, Juan enters and stands near the door, silently taking in everything. \nCLOSE SHOT \nHarolday, as he sees Clint's body and stops dead in horror. He turns to Rocklin. \nHAROLDAY (with cold violence) You murderer. \nROCKLIN I didn't do it, Mr. Harolday. \nHAROLDAY (quickly) Then who did? \nVOICE (from crowd) He had a gun in his hand when we come in. \nGARVEY (smoothly) And I'll bet it's the same one the bullet that killed Clint came out of. \nEXT. REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nRocklin, as he picks himself off the ground, having dropped from the verandah. He starts quickly away. \nEXT. WINDOW OF ROCKLIN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nSHOOTING INTO the room, we see Arly and Dave shoved to one side by Jackson and Garvey. The window goes up and Jackson steps out, followed by Garvey, Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others. \nINT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nThe human jam has been broken, and now the mob dashes wildly toward the stairway, and verandah exit in the b.g. \nEXT. SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nThe hitching rail in front of the Sun-Up. There are a dozen or so horses tied up to it and close to it is Dave's team and wagon. Rocklin comes from around the corner of the building and races to the hitching rail. \nTOP OF OUTSIDE STAIRS \nJackson and Garvey come from around the corner of the porch followed by Harolday, Arly, Dave, and others. At the stairs they collide with some of the men who have raced down the hall, only to reach the stairway at the same moment. There is another jam on the landing as the mob all try to get down at once. \nROCKLIN AT THE HITCHING RAIL \nHe has cut the lines of the horses tied to the rail. We see him cutting the last line and fire into the air. The horses rare and stampede. \nTHE MOB - WITH JACKSON AND GARVEY LEADING - COME FROM AROUND THE BUILDING \nAnd now there is a state of utter confusion as the mob and horses rush in all directions as the men try to retrieve their mounts. Rocklin is no where in evidence. \nGARVEY AND JACKSON - AS HAROLDAY JOINS THEM NEAR DAVE'S WAGON \nHAROLDAY (sarcastically) Well, Sheriff -- you certainly are to be congratulated. \nJACKSON (harassed) Look, Mr. Harolday -- you saw what happened -- \nGARVEY (deeply concerned) Never mind that -- Let's get going for Garden City -- that's where he's headed for. \nHAROLDAY You sure? \nGARVEY I'm positive. \nDave climbs into his wagon behind the group as Jackson exits quickly. \nEXT. STAGE OFFICE - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT \nAt hitching rail. There are four or five horses tied up here. Arly and Juan enter and mount their horses, and almost immediately Garvey and Harolday come hurrying into the scene after two of the other horses. \nARLY (shouts from her horse) Where do you think he's gone? \nBefore either of the two men can answer, Jackson's voice is heard shouting o.s. \nJACKSON'S VOICE All right, men -- follow me -- \nThe CAMERA PANS AROUND, getting Jackson, now mounted, as others come riding in. He rares his horse around and starts away followed by the mob, including our principals. They do not get very far when Dave's wagon comes into the shot, going hell-bent in pursuit. \nEXT. ROAD NEAR EDGE OF SANTA INEZ - NIGHT \nThe posse riding hard, with Dave's wagon following. \nCLOSE SHOT \nDave, half standing as he urges his team on. Behind him are the closed flaps of the wagon top. \nWIDER ANGLE \nas a hand reaches out from between the flaps and grasps the reins. Dave takes it, and looks wildly around -- falls back on the seat. \nON ROCKLIN - AS HIS HEAD COMES FROM BETWEEN THE FLAPS \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include Dave, smiling broadly. Rocklin is pulling hard on the reins. \nDAVE I mighta knowed you'd do somethin' like this. (as Rocklin slows the team) What are we doin'? \nROCKLIN Headin' for the K.C. \nWith that Rocklin starts swinging the team around. \nON THE WAGON AS IT SWINGS AROUND AND BECOMES LOST IN THE DISTANT NIGHT \nWIPE \nINT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - NIGHT \nSammy, the China-boy, is nervously knocking on Miss Martin's door. It opens and Miss Martin is seen slipping a robe over her long Mother Hubbard nightgown, with cap to match. \nMISS MARTIN (impatiently) Now -- what is it? \nSammy points o.s. -- Miss Martin looks and freezes. \nAs she moves down the hall, the CAMERA PANS WITH her until it gets two men standing near the entrance door. \nNow the CAMERA MOVES IN TO A THREE SHOT and we recognize George Clews and his brother, Bob. Bob, his wrist bandaged, takes off his hat at Miss Martin's approach, and George noticing, does likewise. \nGEORGE CLEWS The name's Clews, ma'am -- Mr. Garvey sent us out -- \nBOB CLEWS (eagerly) Said you were expectin' trouble with that Rocklin. \nMISS MARTIN I am. (acidly to George) -- But I'm wondering if you're up to it. I noticed you didn't fare so well with him yesterday. \nBOB CLEWS He was drunk -- \nGEORGE CLEWS (quickly) Yeah -- But I'm sober now. \nMISS MARTIN Well, see that you stay that way. \nEXT. ENTRANCE TO KC RANCH - DAWN \nA wooden gate is swung closed across the roadway. On the gate is a crudely printed weather-beaten sign: K.C. RANCH. Over the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon approaching. \nTHE WAGON PULLS UP TO THE GATE \nRocklin hops out, opens the gate. Dave drives the wagon through. As Rocklin lets go the gate, it swings closed of its own accord. \nEXT. SHED - KC RANCH - DAWN \nThe shed is a short distance from the Caldwell house. Bob Clews is standing at a corner of the shed looking o.s. Over the scene comes the SOUND of the wagon. \nBOB CLEWS (peering into shed) Hey, George -- George, get up. \nEXT. KC RANCH - DAWN \nThe wagon moving slowly through the cottonwoods, along the drive not far from the house. It stops now, and the CAMERA MOVES CLOSER to get Dave and Rocklin as they leave the team and start stealthily toward the house seen in the moonlight in the b.g. \nINT. CLARA'S BEDROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN \nWe pick up Clara in the act of nervously pinning on her hat in the dim light of a small lamp. She is fully dressed, and once the hat is on, she looks around anxiously for her top coat which she finds in the closet. She takes the coat and starts hurriedly toward the lamp, sitting on a small taboret near the door. As she bends over to blow it out, her eyes raise and she freezes. \nMISS MARTIN HAS JUST OPENED THE DOOR AND STANDS THERE STARING ICILY FOR A LONG MOMENT \nNow she snaps the door closed without removing her eyes from Clara, and starts forward. \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK to include the two. Clara stands as one under an hypnotic spell. \nMISS MARTIN (in a very low tone) You vile, ungrateful strumpet -- running away in the night, like a deceitful sneak-thief -- \nCLARA (unrestrained) Yes -- I'm running away -- and it's all your fault -- you're the one who's been deceitful and sneaking -- and don't think I don't know what you intend doing. \nMISS MARTIN (very controlled) -- And don't think I don't know what you intend doing. \nCLARA (crying, as she moves away) I don't care -- I'm not ashamed of it -- and nothing you can say or do is going to stop me. \nMISS MARTIN (hardly above a whisper) You little fool -- if you go to Garden City with that man -- you stand to lose everything. \nCLARA (stops pacing) But why? -- Why are you being so secretive? -- If you know something, why don't you tell me? \nON DAVE AND ROCKLIN AT THE WINDOW LISTENING \nDAVE (nods and mumbles to himself) Yeah -- why don't you? -- \nRocklin quickly shushes Dave. \nON MISS MARTIN AND CLARA \nMISS MARTIN (Unmindful of the presence of the men) All right, I'll tell you -- Rocklin is a nephew of the late Mr. Caldwell. And, as nearest of kin, he stands to get everything -- according to the will. Because you are not the old man's niece, but only his grand-niece. \nDAVE AND ROCKLIN AT THE WINDOW LISTENING - ROCKLIN SOBERLY - DAVE WILD-EYED \nMISS MARTIN'S VOICE Rocklin turned up unexpectedly -- \nCLARA'S VOICE And you and Mr. Garvey knew the truth all the time? \nMISS MARTIN'S VOICE Yes. \nIf Dave keeps quiet any longer he'll burst. He spins Rocklin around and speaks in his natural voice. \nDAVE -- And you knew the truth all the time, too -- didn't you? -- No wonder you stuck around -- \nFrom Rocklin's expression it is quite apparent to Dave that he is right. \nCLARA AND MISS MARTIN \nBoth women are staring dumbly toward the window. Now the realization that she has been overheard staggers Miss Martin. She utters a stifled scream and, seeing Rocklin starting through the window, runs from the room. \nROCKLIN - JUST INSIDE THE ROOM - TURNS TO DAVE \nROCKLIN Get in here and take care of her. \nDave scrambles through the window and hurries in pursuit of Miss Martin. Rocklin is at Clara's side. \nEXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN \nBushes near the house. George and Bob Clews are crouched, watching. \nGEORGE CLEWS Come on -- \nThey move out. \nEXT. ROAD BETWEEN SANTA INEZ AND THE KC RANCH - DAWN \nThe posse riding hard. \nEXT. JAW BONE CANYON - DAWN \nWe see Arly and Julio as they descend a steep embankment toward the raging torrent. They both are riding Julio's horse. \nCLOSE SHOT \nArly and Julio; Arly seated behind Julio, considerably disheveled and sobbing. \nJULIO (comfortingly) You are crying, senorita --? \nARLY (lying bravely) No. \nJULIO (knows she is) It is too bad we lose your horse. She was good horse, for sure. \nARLY If only we make it in time. \nAs they move away into a longer shot, a huge boulder comes crashing down the canyon side, across their path, and tumbles with a great roar and splash into the torrent. \nCLOSE SHOT \nArly. \nARLY Get down from there before I show you. \nINT. OF WAGON - DAWN \nRocklin has regained consciousness and listens. \nGEORGE CLEWS' VOICE Now listen, Arly -- this ain't your wagon -- \nARLY'S VOICE Neither is it yours -- Get down out of there -- before I knock you down. \nRocklin recognizes Arly's voice. Now he raises himself up over the tailboard and falls out. \nEXT. REAR OF WAGON - DAWN \nThe horses tied in back shy as Rocklin falls to the ground. \nEXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN \nArly, as she takes it and starts toward the rear of the wagon. \nBOB CLEWS - STANDING CLOSE TO GEORGE - WHO IS STILL ON THE SEAT - SEES HIS CHANCE TO GET ARLY AND SLOWLY REACHES FOR HIS GUN \nHe no more than gets it out when a knife whirls in from o.s., getting him in the small of the back. \nJUAN \nHe sits calmly astride his horse, his gun leveled on George Clews. \nEXT. REAR OF WAGON - DAWN \nArly is cutting the rope binding Rocklin. \nARLY -- And they're headed this way and should get here any minute -- \nRocklin gets to his feet. Arly notices something shining on the ground where Rocklin lay. She picks it up. It is the tobacco pouch with the steer's head of hammered silver. \nARLY Where'd you get this? \nROCKLIN (taking the pouch) That belongs to the man who shot at me on Table-Top -- Dave found it. \nINT. OF WAGON - DAWN \nOn Dave's Wrapped form, kicking the wagon tailboard. Arly's head appears between the flaps above the tailboard and as Dave groans and kicks, she takes her knife and slits the rope binding him. \nEXT. FRONT OF WAGON - DAWN \nRocklin has come to George clew and we see him wrest the gun from his hand and yank George down from the wagon seat. Once down, he lets him have a hard right that sends him sprawling. \nON GEORGE CLEWS GETTING UP OFF THE GROUND AND ROCKLIN CLOSING IN \nThey start fighting viciously. Arly rushes in crying wildly. \nARLY (trying to stop Rocklin) You've got to get away -- they'll be here -- they'll catch you -- \nCLOSE SHOT \nRocklin. There is but one thought in his enraged mind -- Clews. He tears into him again. \nON ARLY AS DAVE JOINS HER \nARLY (frantically) You've got to stop him -- he's got to get away. \nTHE FIGHT - AS DAVE AND ARLY FUTILELY ATTEMPT TO BREAK IT UP \nON DAVE AS HE GETS IN THE WAY OF ONE THAT SITS HIM DOWN \nON THE FIGHT AS ROCKLIN GETS IN A SUNDAY PUNCH THAT SENDS GEORGE BACKWARD INTO A SHALLOW DITCH OUT OF SIGHT \nON GEORGE CLEWS LYING UNCONSCIOUS IN THE DITCH \nEXT.

(shouts) You're puttin' a rope around your neck -- \nDave runs after Rocklin. \nARLY AND JUAN - ARLY CLIMBING HURRIEDLY UP ONTO THE WAGON SEAT \nARLY Get him -- (indicates Bob Clews) -- out of sight, and follow me. \nClara tiptoes away. \nEXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN \nArly and Juan, as they watch Harolday approach the house and go to the hall window. \nINT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN \nGarvey and Miss Martin. Garvey is still pacing very nervously. He is trying to think of his next move. \nMISS MARTIN If you were to ask me, I think the best thing to do is -- \nGarvey stops and glares. \nGARVEY (irritably) I'm not asking you -- and don't bother me with your silly questions -- we've got to do something besides talk. \nMISS MARTIN (drawing herself up) You mean -- you have to do something. \nGarvey stops and looks at her again. \nMISS MARTIN -- This was all your idea, remember. \nGARVEY (tossing it off) My idea -- that's all you know about it. \nTHE DOOR TO CLARA'S BEDROOM \nIt is open and Rocklin stands there looking o.s. \nROCKLIN If there's anybody else in on it -- speak up, Judge. \nON GARVEY AS HE WHIPS AROUND AND STARES AT ROCKLIN \nON MISS MARTIN - GAPING OPEN-MOUTHED \nMISS MARTIN Well -- I do declare -- \nShe can say no more. \nFULL SHOT \nRocklin steps away from the door, where Dave and Clara now stand. He has Garvey covered. Dave is pointing his gun, and grimacing at Miss Martin. \nEXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE -DAWN \nAt hall window -- on Harolday watching. \nINT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN \nGarvey is stepping back, in a cold sweat, toward Miss Martin, as Rocklin advances toward him. \nROCKLIN (to Garvey, quite casually) Talk. \nMiss Martin opens her mouth, about to speak. \nFLASH \nof Dave. \nDAVE (blasting, to Miss Martin) Not you. \nCLOSE SHOT \nMiss Martin. Her mouth snaps shut like a trap. \nTHREE SHOT \nGarvey, Rocklin, Miss Martin. Rocklin takes the tobacco pouch out of his pocket. \nROCKLIN (to Garvey) Ever see that before? \nGARVEY (blanches) No -- it's not mine. \nROCKLIN Tell me whose it is. \nGARVEY (shaking) No -- no -- I don't know -- \nEXT. FRONT OF CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN \nHarolday at hall window. He raises his gun -- he is about to fire when a knife whirls out of nowhere and sticks in the window frame, inches from Harolday's head. He spins around and stares wildly here and there at the darkness. \nGROUNDS AND BUSHES NEAR THE FRONT DOOR - FROM HAROLDAY'S ANGLE \nThere is no one in evidence. \nARLY'S VOICE Drop that gun. \nON HAROLDAY AT THE HALL WINDOW - STARING HARD - TRYING TO LOCATE THE VOICE \nHe drops the gun. Arly and Juan come in to him. Arly has him covered. \nThe CAMERA PULLS BACK to a WIDER ANGLE, getting the front door as it is opened by Rocklin, who evidently heard Arly. \nAT FRONT DOOR \nArly is prodding Harolday into the scene. \nARLY (to Rocklin) He was just getting ready to finish you off, through that window. \nINT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - DAWN \nHarolday is herded inside, close to Garvey and Miss Martin. \nROCKLIN (almost enjoying this) You seem to like to do business through windows, Mr. Harolday. \n", "test1_input": "ON ROCKLIN \nHe is looking down at the Clerk and answers quite casually, but loud enough to be heard by the women. \nROCKLIN I never feel sorry for anything that happens to a woman. \nINT. COACH - DAY \nTHROUGH window of door -- Miss Martin and Clara. The women have obviously overheard Rocklin's remark. Miss Martin smiles vindictively at Clara, who flushes. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to include the Clerk, who moves to the coach door. \nCLERK Well, I hope you have a nice trip, ladies. \nMISS MARTIN I hope we get there -- wouldn't surprise me if we didn't. \nEXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY \nOn Dave and Rocklin. \nDAVE (mutters) Wait till I get you on the road, you old buzzard, you'll be surprised all right. \nHe takes up the reins and shouts the team away. \nDISSOLVE OUT \nDISSOLVE IN \nEXT. ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY \nEXTREME LONG SHOT -- with the stage hardly more than a black dot below, its curl of rising dust in the midst of the whole broad expanse. As the coach disappears from shot, the two mounted men appear riding at an easy pace and continue in the same direction as the coach. \nEXT. DRIVER'S SEAT OF COACH - DAY \nMED. CLOSE SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin, the latter staring straight ahead. As they roll with the roll of the coach, Dave steals a look at his companion. \nDAVE I wonder why a young feller who don't have to wants to come into this God danged country? \nRocklin ignores Dave's question and continues staring ahead. Dave glances down toward the women. \nDAVE Say -- did you mean what you said back there about wimmen? \nROCKLIN (grimly) Every word of it. \nDAVE (chuckling) Then you're smarter than most. \nROCKLIN Maybe I seen more of 'em than most. \nDAVE (looking at him admiringly) Shouldn't be surprised. Shouldn't be a leetle bit surprised. (reflectively) All the same... \nHe breaks off and chuckles again. \nROCKLIN (unsmilingly) All the same -- what? \nDave doesn't reply, but lifting the pint of whiskey, jerks out the cork with one movement of his thumbnail. \nDAVE (offering bottle to Rocklin) Take a slug. \nRocklin drinks and gives the bottle back to Dave, who all but empties it in one pull. \nDAVE (holding up the bottle and squinting through it) Whiskey and wimmen -- ever think how much alike they are? Both fool you, but you never figger out how to do without 'em. \nRocklin makes no reply. Dave offers the bottle again. \nDAVE Take another. \nROCKLIN Not just yet. \nDAVE (unoffended) Well... (putting the bottle to his lips) Here's to her. \nROCKLIN Who? \nDAVE The next one that fools you. \nHe empties the bottle and shies it away. At the same time, the coach hits a particularly bad patch of road and there is muffled exclamation from inside the coach. Dave leans over and looks down o.s. \nINT. COACH - DAY \nMED. CLOSE SHOT -- Clara and Miss Martin. The former is showing the effects of the rough ride, but the old lady is hanging on grimly. \nEXT. DRIVER'S SEAT - DAY \nDave straightens up, grinning. \nDAVE (with relish) Mighty rough stretch along here. \nHe whips up the team, at the same time weaving a little unsteadily in his seat. \nROCKLIN Like me to speel you a while? \nDAVE Nope. I've had a few snorts but that don't make no difference. Leas'ways, never has... (after a second's pause) Don't ever git wore out, and useless, like me. \nROCKLIN Who're them as say you are? \nDAVE Harolday, for one. Oh, I ain't belly- aching. Reckon he's entitled to his opinion. But him and me never did see eye to eye. \nROCKLIN What's wrong? \nDAVE It's constitootional, I reckon. Like that step-daughter of his is crazy -- he's too sane. Believes In law and order. \nROCKLIN (grinning) What's wrong with law and order? \nDAVE Depends on who's a-dishin' it out. Never was good at takin' orders meself.

Driver, what's the matter? \nDAVE Nothin'. Restin' hosses. Git out and stretch yore laigs if you want. \nMISS MARTIN Resting horses? What for? I can see with my own eyes it's downhill. \nDave brightens visibly at this challenge. \nDAVE You in such an all-fired hurry, lady? \nMISS MARTIN Certainly, we are in a hurry. \nDAVE (beaming) Well -- we'll hurry some. \nHis whip cracks like a rifle shot and the startled horses literally jerk the heavy stage over the rim and down the grade. \nLONG SHOT \ngrade, with the stagecoach bounding and reeling down the narrow road and around the sharp bends. \nCLOSE FULL SHOT \nDave and Rocklin on stage as it thunders downhill. Dave is leaning out and listening hopefully for the outcries from within. None come. Rocklin is hanging on with both hands and mildly amused. \nINT. STAGECOACH - DAY \nThe two women are really being scrambled. \nEXT. STAGECOACH - ARIZONA COUNTRY - DAY \nCLOSE TWO SHOT -- Dave and Rocklin. Rocklin is as calm as if he were walking.

He makes no move, however, to advise or interfere. \nFULL SHOT \nroad; at danger corner, as stage comes in. At the very last second, Dave pulls in the horses and negotiates the turn in safety. \nCLOSE SHOT \nstage. Dave grins at Rocklin, then listens for the outcry he expects from the women within.

STAN'S PLACE - DAY \nFULL SHOT of lonely adobe which serves as a combination roadhouse, stage station and bar. As the coach rolls into f.g., a little Mexican boy (Pablo) runs out to change the horses. \nPABLO (as Rocklin swings down) Buenas noches, senor. \nROCKLIN Buenas noches, amigo. \nPABLO (grinning at the friendly tone) Ha llegado anticipademente, senor. \nROCKLIN Tuvimos suerte en haber llegado. \nHe glances pointedly at Dave who is climbing down unsteadily and Pablo bursts out laughing. \nMED.

On the other side is a fireplace and a partition behind which is a rough dining table and benches. Standing at the bar drinking with his back to the door is a wizened little man, dressed in an odd assortment of ragged garments of unrecognizable origin. On the counter is a travelling prospector's pack, to which is strapped an assortment of prospector's equipment, including a pick and shovel. As Dave enters, the man (Zeke) turns around and reveals a face even hairier than Dave's. \n", "test1_id": 1461, "test2_input": "ARLY He's got a proposition to make -- about riding for him.

This man is no good. \nCLARA Auntie! \nARLY (to Rocklin ignoring Miss Martin) Well? D'you want the job? \nCLOSE SHOT \nRocklin, as he stares at Arly with an enigmatic expression.

Rocklin makes a little gesture to the ladies with his hat and follows. As he goes, Juan, who has been leaning against the doorpost, follows, closing the door behind him. \nCLARA (after they have gone) Auntie, why did you have to say that? I simply don't understand you... \nMISS MARTIN (cutting in, grimly) But I understand you. (scathingly) I'd be ashamed of myself. Throwing myself at a man like that. \nCLARA I... I...

MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY \nArly and Rocklin walking along the street, not far from Harolday's office. Rocklin glances back toward Julio, who is following a few paces behind them.

At Arly's abrupt entrance, he looks up, startled. \nARLY I've just hired a man named Rocklin and said you made me do it. Sixty dollars and he 'll earn it -- while he lasts. \nThere is a little pause. Harolday's face is completely dead pan. He looks out of the window for a second, then back at Arly. \nHAROLDAY (quietly) Why did you do it, Arly? \nARLY So I can fire him. I hate him. Clint and he quarrelled last night. Clint lied about it and I made a fool of myself. (nodding toward the outer office) He's outside now. \nHAROLDAY (with a little sigh) All right.

SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nThe place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons. A group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office. At the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging doors. The bar supports other customers engaged in various private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of George Clews who, with his brother, Bob, stands at the bar's center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of him. He is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the others, but regards them all with disdain. He downs his drink, and speaks his thought to Bob. \nGEORGE CLEWS I'm gonna get his ears. \nSuddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and halts with the swinging doors half open. \nDAVE (loudly) Hi you, George Clews -- \nGeorge Clews turns. \nDAVE Rocklin says if you don't come out, he'll come in here after you, an' tear you apart. \nGeorge Clews frowns. His eye catches sight of a king-size glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis, standing alongside him. That quick, Clews beats Shorty to the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out. Cap, anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty. \nSHORTY (taps Clews) That was my beer, you know. \nGEORGE CLEWS (nastily) If he comes in again -- I'll throw you. \nBefore Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him struggling to get his hat off. The crowd resents this, but doesn't dare do anything, except Cap, who holds his shotgun in sight. \nCAP (to the Clews) That does it, boys -- you know where the door is. \nGEORGE CLEWS (to Bob) Com-mon -- I'll get his ears. \nCAP Not until I get my money -- \nGeorge and Bob Clews are now a few steps from the bar. They have turned as Cap spoke and are looking at the shotgun. \nCAP There's three drinks and a broken beer glass. \nGEORGE CLEWS (to Bob, after a second's deliberation) Pay 'im. \nGeorge turns and starts for the doors as Bob comes back to the bar to settle up. \nGEORGE CLEWS I'll get his ears. \nON PAP FOSSLER AND THE OTHERS AT WINDOW - AS GEORGE CLEWS BURSTS OUT THROUGH THE DOORS \nPAP (quietly) That Rocklin'll kill him for sure. \nCUSTOMER Le's hope. \nEXT.

He is walking slowly forward down the middle of the street. \nMED.

His hands are on his guns, but drunk or not, he has too much sense to draw too soon. \nEXT. STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY \n", "test2_id": 1462, "test3_input": "Clara can say no more without breaking. So she turns away quickly and hurries out the door. Rocklin does a slow burn as he glares at Arly. \nARLY (sincerely -- after a pause) She's lovely, isn't she? -- So sweet -- honest, and helpless. \nRocklin makes no reply. \nARLY Pity you didn't fall in love with her, instead of me. \nArly is being ridiculous now. He ignores her remarks and concentrates his attention on one of his hands -- he may have sprained it slightly in the fight. \nROCKLIN You might's well know right now that you or no woman is ever goin' to get me. \nARLY Don't be so sure -- I don't think I'm doin' so badly. \nROCKLIN Don't you? \nARLY Don't you know? \nROCKLIN I know there ain't a dirty trick you wouldn't play to get what you want. \nARLY (smiling) I always get what I want. \nShe takes a folded piece of paper out of her pocket and drops it on the dresser as Rocklin watches her. \nARLY -- See? (opens the door) -- 'Bye now -- \nThe door closes. Rocklin stands a moment. Now curiosity brings him to the dresser where he takes up the paper and unfolds it. \nCLARA'S LETTER. The torn pieces have all been sorted and pasted together on a sheet of paper \nBACK TO SCENE. Rocklin holds the letter. He is mad. He shakes his head -- What a gal --- Now he is almost smiling -- almost. He folds the letter -- puts it in his pocket. Takes off his gun-belt and hangs it over the rocker near the window, and stretches out on the bed, as we \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nON Clara hurrying toward the front door in a suppressed state of excitement. She has presumably just arrived at the ranch in advance of Miss Martin. She enters the house after a glance toward the gate. \nINT. HALL - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nClara enters hastily and beats a path to the door of her room. \nINT. CLARA'S ROOM - CALDWELL HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe door flies open. Clara bursts in, closing the door in the same movement. Her eyes swing to someone o.s. and she freezes to the spot. \nON \nMiss Martin, standing by the window, cold and threatening. She has not taken the time to remove her hat. After a moment's pause, she moves slowly toward Clara. \nThe CAMERA PANS WITH her into a TWO SHOT. Clara, her back pressing harder and harder against the door, becomes more terrified at the other's approach. Miss Martin appraises the girl a short moment and now suddenly slaps her hard across the face. Clara opens her mouth, about to scream, but even stifles this impulse under the cold stare of her aunt. \nMISS MARTIN (quietly but viciously) Whatever is to become of you? \nClara can only stare as one under an hypnotic spell. \nMISS MARTIN Have you no sense of pride, or decency? Throwing yourself at that -- that wretch, like any shameless hussy. \nClara hasn't moved. \nMISS MARTIN I thought we'd done with him -- but no -- you have to run to him and tell him all our business -- \nClara merely gasps for a breath of air, but Miss Martin, thinking her about to speak, goes on, more forcefully now. \nMISS MARTIN Don't you dare deny it -- you know very well you told him about that letter I wrote Mr. Garvey. \nClara remains silent. \nMISS MARTIN Didn't you? -- \nClara, now utterly broken, moves away. Miss Martin, her eyes still rivited on the girl, follows. \nMISS MARTIN Didn't you? \nDISSOLVE \nINT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe office has been more or less cleaned up since the fight. Garvey is discovered near the window. He has cleaned himself up but bears some evidence of the fight. He is reading a letter as Sammy, the K.C. China-boy, stands waiting near the door. \nLETTER. The message is written in the same bold hand of Miss Martin already seen in the previous letter: \nMr. Garvey, \nI have just learned that despicable Rocklin person intends to take Clara to Garden City in the morning -- evidently to have you investigated. I thought you had better know about it. \nE.M. \nBACK TO SCENE. Garvey puts the message in his pocket as he addresses Sammy. \nGARVEY Tell Miss Martin that I'll take care of everything. \nSAMMY -- You take clare of evelything. \nDISSOLVE OUT \nDISSOLVE IN \nINT.

MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - NIGHT \nThe area in front of the Sun-Up. Dave's wagon pulls up to the hitching rail in front of the saloon. Clint, stripped of his gun, is driving with Dave, alertly watching him. They get down from the wagon and Dave prods Clint toward the corner of the building. \nEXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nGarvey has left the spot where we saw him look up to Rocklin's window. We now see him as he rounds a rear corner of the building and goes toward the outer stairs leading to the Sun- Up's second floor. He starts up the steps and stops almost immediately and stares o.s. \nANGEL \nFrom Garvey's ANGLE as he sees Dave bringing Clint from around in front of the building toward the stairway. \nCAMERA HOLDS \nGarvey steps quickly to the ground and takes up a position around the roar corner. He watches the two men approach the stairway and go up. He moves out of the shot now, going toward the street. The CAMERA HOLDS on the corner, and we see Tala come into view, as though from nowhere, and take the exact position at the building's corner vacated by Garvey only a moment before. It is apparent that he is watching Garvey, and after a momentary pause he too moves stealthily out of the scene. \nINT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nPANNING SHOT on Rocklin asleep. He is fully dressed, as we last saw him, with the exception of his boots. He is stretched full length on top of the covers. His gun-belt still hangs over the rocker, close to the open window. A knock on the door brings him to a sitting position. \nROCKLIN Come in -- \nCAMERA PANS TO door as Clint enters reluctantly, followed by the triumphant Dave. \nDAVE Here he is, Rock. Caught him jist in time near the Santee. Headed fer out, I'd say. \nROCKLIN Sit down, Clint. (to Dave, as he reaches into his pocket) How about goin' down below an' havin' one on me? \nHe tosses Dave a coin, who catches it. Then Rocklin puts on his boots. \nDAVE (delighted) Well, now -- that's right thoughtful -- Holler if you need me. \nDave exits. \nCLINT (belligerently, as he stands near the window) What's this all about? \nROCKLIN (calmly, as he stands up) It ain't gonna do you any good to get all het up and tough, kid -- \nRocklin begins rolling a cigarette as he moves toward Clint. \nROCKLIN I just want to ask you a few questions -- that's all. \nEXT. SIDE OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nAn unidentifiable form is seen moving through the darkness toward the outer stairway. As it nears the stairway, the CAMERA MOVES IN so that as the mysterious figure begins stealthily up the stairs, we see only the feet through the rungs. \nThe CAMERA THEN PANS QUICKLY AND ZOOMS INTO A CLOSE SHOT of Juan, across the alley. And now through Juan's eyes we watch the ascent of the mysterious intruder: The Mexican's line of vision gradually raises, then the eyes slowly move across the camera as the dark figure proceeds along to the rear portion of the verandah. \nINT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nRocklin finishes rolling his cigarette and lights it. \nCLINT I told you once, I don't know who owns that pouch-- and I don't know who shot you. \nROCKLIN (calmly) Forget it -- that's not what I want to talk to you about, anyway. \nCLINT (harshly) Well, what do you want to talk about? Come on, get it over with. \nEXT. VERANDAH - REAR OF SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nThe mysterious form has moved past the darkened windows along the verandah and is nearing Rocklin's lighted room -- stops close to the open window. \nINT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - NIGHT \nSHOT -- Rocklin and Clint. \nROCKLIN Clint -- I want you to tell me why Garvey murdered Red Caldwell -- \nClint tenses -- stares -- finds breathing difficult. \nROCKLIN You know -- don't you? \nCLINT (shaking) Me? No! \nROCKLIN Oh yes you do. (advancing on him) And you're going to tell me all about it. \nCLINT I don't know nothing, I tell you -- I -- \nRocklin slaps Clint's face open-handed, throwing him off balance, then grabs him by the shirt front. \nROCKLIN Talk! \nCLINT I tell ya, I... \nROCKLIN (hitting him again) Talk! \nCompletely terrified, Clint opens his mouth as if about to speak. Suddenly he sees something out of the shot over Rocklin's shoulder and his expression changes. Rocklin looks quickly in the same direction. \nMED. SHOT \nwindow. A gloved hand has come out of the dark and is reaching through the window for Rocklin's gun in the belt which is hanging over the chair. \nCLOSE SHOT \nClint and Rocklin. The latter is still looking toward the window. With a swift movement Clint picks up the water jug from the washstand and brings it down on Rocklin's head. As Rocklin falls out of shot, Clint turns to the window with a triumphant smile. Suddenly his expression changes. \nCLINT (in a hoarse scream) No! No, don't! \nThere is a shot from o.s. and Clint's hands go to his stomach. With a gasp of pain he doubles up and collapses on the floor. \nSHOT \n", "test3_id": 1463}

{"test1_input": "TALL IN THE SADDLE \nWritten by \nMichael Hogan & Paul P Fix \nStory by \nGordon Ray Young \n1944 SHOOTING DRAFT \nEXT. GARDEN CITY STATION - DAY \nCLOSE SHOT -- station signboard. It reads: \n\"GARDEN CITY\" \nCAMERA PANS to show the dusty platform of a typical small Arizona town of the late nineties. \nCAMERA TRUCKS ALONG platform PAST a line of sleeping figures, consisting of a couple of drunks, an Indian, two Mexicans and a mongrel dog. \nCAMERA STOPS on the window of the ticket office. Inside the office can be glimpsed the Station Agent dozing in a chair with his feet up against the grill of the ticket window. The clicking of the signal indicator is heard. The agent opens his eyes, flips up the indicator and begins to get to his feet sleepily. \nMED. SHOT \nline of sleeping figures, with dog in f.g. The sound of a distant train whistle is heard o.s. The dog, which up to now might have been dead, opens one eye and looks past camera. \nLONG SHOT \nrailway track with the three-car train approaching. \nMED. SHOT \nline of sleeping figures. The dog jumps up barking furiously and runs out of shot past camera. The sleeping figures come to life and look toward camera. At the same time, the door of the ticket office opens and the agent appears. \nFULL SHOT \nrailway track. The train is now almost at the station. \nEXT. PLATFORM - DAY \nFULL SHOT -- with the line of men now standing on the edge of the platform looking toward camera. Train steams slowly in past camera, and stops, with a tall, wide-shouldered man of about 28 (Rocklin), dressed in new store clothes, cowboots and a broad-brimmed white hat, in f. g. standing on steps of day coach with a small valise and saddle in his hands. Behind Rocklin a conductor. \nMED. SHOT \nbaggage car. The baggageman is standing at the open door of the car with two sacks of mail. He drops them to the platform and waves to the conductor o.s. and begins to close the doors of the baggage car. \nMED. CLOSE SHOT \non Station Agent and conductors. The latter signals the engineer. The train whistle sounds again o.s. and the shadow of the moving train begins to pass across the Station Agent's face. \nTRUCKING SHOT \nAs Rocklin comes along the platform carrying the valise in one hand and balancing the saddle on his shoulder with the other, a man behind him picks up the two mail sacks and exits from scene. The station bums look at Rocklin curiously. His expression giving no encouragement, they slink back out of the sun and begin to settle down in their old places again. At the ticket office, Rocklin pauses and looks around uncertainly. \nSTATION AGENT (at office door) Expectin' someone? \nROCKLIN (after a second's pause) I guess not. Where's the stagecoach office? \nSTATION AGENT (pointing) Back of the depot. \nEXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY \nThe stage is drawn up in front of the depot, over which is a sign -- \nRED ROCK STAGE \nJ. Harolday Proprietor \nRocklin, making his way along the walk, almost reaches the depot when his attention is arrested by the sight of Dave, the stage driver, who has just rounded in front of the lead horses. He pauses close to one horse's head. Rocklin sees Dave take a bottle from his person, uncork it as he glances around, and raise it to drink. The bottle is almost to Dave's lips when the horse shies, swinging its head. The bottle is knocked from the old fellow's hands and smashes on the ground. Now Rocklin witnesses a scene of intense fury, which he finds amusing despite its seriousness. Old Dave rants and snorts -- beats his thighs, his heads, flings his arms wildly and exhibits his utter disgust generally. \nDAVE (to horse) Consarn you, Blossom -- lookit that -- jus' lookit what you done -- (some more pantomime) I'm tellin' you, Blossom that -- (indicating broken bottle) -- makes you the most aggravatin' female as ever I had a despise fer -- I've got a good notion to pizen you -- an' what's more -- \nHe stops talking abruptly because his hand has, quite by chance, felt the spare bottle he carries, which he has forgotten in his anger. A most satisfying smile lights his bewhiskered face as he brings the bottle into view. He uncorks it, and stepping a few paces from the horse, raises the bottle. \nDAVE (to Blossom) Heh-heh -- fooled you, didn't I? -- (chuckles) Fooled myself, too. \nON ROCKLIN \nwho has been watching Dave's performance. He smiles his amusement and now proceeds toward the stage office. \nINT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY \nPAN SHOT. Rocklin enters and moves over to the counter, behind which is the stage agent, a mild-looking man with pebble- lens glasses. During the scene, the character who picked up the mail sacks from the platform, comes in, dumps the sacks on the counter and leaves. \nSTAGE AGENT (to Rocklin) Howdy. \nROCKLIN (indicating stage) That the stage for Santa Inez? \nSTAGE AGENT (nods) Leaving any minute. \nRocklin puts his saddle on the counter, and taking out a wad of bills, drops them on the counter. The Stage Agent counts out the fare. \nSTAGE AGENT Santa Inez -- seventeen-fifty -- (returning the balance) Name? \nROCKLIN Rocklin. \nThe Stage Agent turns to make out the ticket. Rocklin takes some tobacco and paper from his vest pocket as he glances outside. \nROCKLIN Mind if I ride alongside the driver? \nSTAGE AGENT (over his specs) It's all right with me -- if it's all right with Dave -- He's mad -- His last trip -- Had a row with Harolday, the boss -- Old-timer, Dave -- an' a grumpy old cuss. \n", "test1_true": "STAGE AGENT (puzzled) Yeah? \nHe shakes his head and hands Rocklin the ticket, and moves over to the door with one of the mail sacks in his hand. \nEXT. GARDEN CITY STAGE DEPOT - DAY \nThe Stage Agent, carrying a mail sack, and Rocklin come from the stage depot and reach the stage as Dave is in the act of climbing up to the driver's seat. \nSTAGE AGENT Here's your mail, Dave -- \nDave looks over his shoulder at the Agent and steps to the ground, as Rocklin climbs up to the driver's seat. \nROCKLIN (as he steps up to the seat) -- and a passenger. \nDave glares at Rocklin climbing up to the seat, and he is about to order him down when Rocklin, now seated, looks down at him and asks rather wistfully -- \nROCKLIN Mind if I ride up here? \nDave does mind, but his better judgment tells him to step carefully in his attitude toward this stranger, who does things first, then asks permission. His only answer to Rocklin is a characteristic grimace which is eloquent enough. And now Dave turns on the Agent, who becomes the target of his pent-up wrath. \nDAVE Where's them wimmen? \nSTAGE AGENT Up at the hotel. \nDAVE (yanking mail sack from Agent) Why ain't they here? -- This is the stage depot, ain't it -- ? (heaves sack into boot) Ain't it? \nSTAGE AGENT You can pick 'em up there -- it's only up the street -- \nDAVE On'y up the street -- an' they cain't walk it -- What's the matter -- don't Easterners have laigs like other folks? \nDave stalks around the rear of the coach. The Agent meantime stretches himself up toward Rocklin. \nSTAGE AGENT (so Dave won't hear) Hold tight when you git in the mountains, mister -- When he gits riled you can hear the passengers prayin' for miles. \nDave has climbed to his seat, and now the coach lurches away, leaving the Agent shaking his head dubiously. \nEXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY \nFrom the porch of the hotel. We see the stage approaching as the hotel handyman brings a trunk and a couple of bags from the hotel to the street. The coach pulls up and stops. \nDAVE (to handyman) Whar's them wimmen? -- They waitin' for you to carry 'em out? \nBefore the handyman can answer, Dave's attention is taken by someone calling his name from across the street. Meantime, an Indian squaw wobbles from the hotel with bow and arrow, etc. Rocklin buys bow and arrow. \nSADDLER (as he comes to Dave) Dave -- Dave -- tell Arly Harolday her saddle ain't ready yet, will ya? \nDAVE (getting to the ground) I ain't tellin' that crazy female nothin' -- Last time I seen her she threatened to rip the hide off'n me and bat me dizzy with it. \nDave goes to the rear of the coach. \nSADDLER (looks up to Rocklin) Mister -- will you tell the Agent at Santa Inez to tell Miss Harolday her saddle ain't ready yet? \nROCKLIN (nods) I'll say that. \nPORCH OF HOTEL \nMiss Martin steps out onto the porch followed by Clara and a gentleman, presumably the hotel manager or clerk. The women are obviously Easterners and are attired in the good taste of the period. Miss Martin is a domineering woman, approaching middle age. Her niece, Clara, is a well-bred, attractive girl of twenty-one and completely under the influence of the older woman. \nCLERK (as group comes through door) By next year, madam, we expect to have a bathtub on each floor. \nMiss Martin stops short and looks o.s. \nON DAVE AT REAR OF THE COUCH \nhaving a time lifting the trunk up into the boot. Miss Martin and the others come into the scene. \nMISS MARTIN Now don't drop it -- \nDave pauses to see who is talking. \nMISS MARTIN At your age you'd best not be lifting things so heavy. \nDAVE (grimaces) Mebbe you're young enough to hoist her up your own self. (tries to lift trunk again) \nCLOSE SHOT \non Clara. She is looking rather timidly up at Rocklin. \nCLOSE SHOT \non Rocklin. He is grinning appreciatively at old Dave. Now he notices Clara and regards her soberly a moment. \nFULL SHOT \nDave has heaved the trunk in place and is securing it. \nMiss Martin, about to enter the coach, notices Clara staring up at Rocklin. \nMISS MARTIN Clara! \nClara snaps her attention from Rocklin to her aunt. The Clerk steps to the side of the coach and opens the door. He assists Clara inside -- and now Miss Martin. \nINT. COACH - DAY \nMiss Martin and Clara. Miss Martin is just sitting. She looks coldly at Clara. \nMISS MARTIN (in low voice) Staring as though you'd never seen a man before. \nEXT. GARDEN CITY HOTEL - DAY \nDave, Rocklin and Clerk. Dave is at the moment climbing to his seat on the other side of the coach. The Clerk swings the door closed and looks up to Rocklin and speaks more or less confidentially. \nCLERK Try to hold him down or he'll scare the women to death. \n", "test1_id": 1461, "test2_input": "ARLY He's got a proposition to make -- about riding for him. Sixty a month. \nROCKLIN Hmmm -- That's a foreman's wages. \nARLY (suddenly exploding) I wouldn't offer you a red cent. (controlling herself) But it's his money. (bitingly) And the way things are shaping, maybe we could do with somebody as mean as you around the ranch. \nMISS MARTIN (pushing her way forward) I warn you, you're making a great mistake. This man is no good. \nCLARA Auntie! \nARLY (to Rocklin ignoring Miss Martin) Well? D'you want the job? \nCLOSE SHOT \nRocklin, as he stares at Arly with an enigmatic expression. Suddenly, he seems to make up his mind. \nROCKLIN (indicating the door) Lead the way. \nMED. SHOT \nas Arly turns abruptly on her heel and exits the way she came. Rocklin makes a little gesture to the ladies with his hat and follows. As he goes, Juan, who has been leaning against the doorpost, follows, closing the door behind him. \nCLARA (after they have gone) Auntie, why did you have to say that? I simply don't understand you... \nMISS MARTIN (cutting in, grimly) But I understand you. (scathingly) I'd be ashamed of myself. Throwing myself at a man like that. \nCLARA I... I... (suddenly bursting into tears) Oh, you're horrid -- horrid. I wish I'd never come. \nShe turns abruptly and drops onto the couch by the window. \nCAMERA PANS TO HOLD A CLOSE TWO SHOT of Garvey and Miss Martin. \nMISS MARTIN You must excuse her. She's young. \nGARVEY And inexperienced. \nGarvey leans back in his chair and smiles. \nMISS MARTIN (significantly) And young people must be protected from themselves at times -- don't you agree? \nMiss Martin throws him a quick look, which he returns steadily. \nGARVEY (at last, with a grim echo of a smile) Exactly. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY \nArly and Rocklin walking along the street, not far from Harolday's office. Rocklin glances back toward Julio, who is following a few paces behind them. He rides his horse and is leading Arly's. \nROCKLIN (to Arly, indicating Julio) Does he always follow you? \nARLY (defiantly) He's not following me -- he's with me -- he's always with me. \nROCKLIN (takes it mildly) Oh -- just an old Indian friend. \nARLY (straight at him) The best friend I've got. \nRocklin nods, looks back again at Julio, then back to Arly as they go out of shot. \nINT. SANTA INEZ STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY \nPAINING SHOT -- as Arly comes to from the street, followed by Julio and Rocklin. \nARLY (abruptly to Rocklin) Wait here. \nCAMERA PANS her over to a door marked \"PRIVATE,\" which she opens without knocking. \nINT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY \nMED. SHOT as Arly comes through from the outer office toward Harolday, who is seated at desk in f.g. At Arly's abrupt entrance, he looks up, startled. \nARLY I've just hired a man named Rocklin and said you made me do it. Sixty dollars and he 'll earn it -- while he lasts. \nThere is a little pause. Harolday's face is completely dead pan. He looks out of the window for a second, then back at Arly. \nHAROLDAY (quietly) Why did you do it, Arly? \nARLY So I can fire him. I hate him. Clint and he quarrelled last night. Clint lied about it and I made a fool of myself. (nodding toward the outer office) He's outside now. \nHAROLDAY (with a little sigh) All right. Send him in. \nArly goes to the door and opens it. \nARLY (calling) Come in. \nRocklin comes in and Arly exits without a word, closing the door behind her. \nREVERSE SHOT \nas Rocklin comes from the doorway into f.g. of shot, facing Harolday, who is seated on the far side of the desk. \nHAROLDAY Mr. Rocklin, what happened between you and my son last night? \nROCKLIN Poker. \nHAROLDAY Hmmm. About this suggestion of you working for me. \nROCKLIN It's your suggestion, not mine. \nHAROLDAY Ye-es. Sixty dollars is big money. \nROCKLIN (turning to go) If you've changed your mind... \nHAROLDAY No, no.... Wait a minute. I take it you've had the experience. \n", "test2_true": "HAROLDAY Oh -- had Caldwell hired you? \nROCKLIN Yeah -- but I won't ride for the new owners -- so that leaves me open. \nHAROLDAY I see -- Were you a friend of Red's? \nROCKLIN No -- I guess he just heard about me. \nA sudden clatter of feet is heard and all eyes turn toward the door. \nMED. SHOT \nas Dave, followed by Arly and Juan, bursts in. His eyes go around the room quickly until he finds Rocklin. \nDAVE (as excited as a schoolboy) George Clews is in town. He's seen what you done to Bob and he's a- lookin' for you. \nThey all look quickly toward the window. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nLONG SHOT -- from stagecoach office window. The center of the street is clear and men's heads are peering from doorways. \nINT. HAROLDAY'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY \nMED. SHOT -- group at window, looking into street. \nHAROLDAY The street is clear. \nDave turns and looks curiously at Rocklin, who frowns impatiently. \nROCKLIN (to Dave irritably) Tell him I'll be out in the street in front of the saloon. \nDAVE (dashing out, radiant) Uh-huh! \nINT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nThe place is quite full and the atmosphere is one of expectancy despite the outward casualness of the patrons. A group lolls near the window, looking toward the stage office. At the door a couple of customers peer out over the swinging doors. The bar supports other customers engaged in various private conversations but all are mindful of the presence of George Clews who, with his brother, Bob, stands at the bar's center, morosely toying with a glass of whisky in front of him. He is quite conscious of the subtle glances of the others, but regards them all with disdain. He downs his drink, and speaks his thought to Bob. \nGEORGE CLEWS I'm gonna get his ears. \nSuddenly Old Dave appears in a high state of excitement, and halts with the swinging doors half open. \nDAVE (loudly) Hi you, George Clews -- \nGeorge Clews turns. \nDAVE Rocklin says if you don't come out, he'll come in here after you, an' tear you apart. \nGeorge Clews frowns. His eye catches sight of a king-size glass of beer being slid across the bar to Shorty Davis, standing alongside him. That quick, Clews beats Shorty to the glass and hurls it at Dave, who ducks out. Cap, anticipating trouble, brings a sawed-off shotgun up from under the bar and now watches Clews and Shorty. \nSHORTY (taps Clews) That was my beer, you know. \nGEORGE CLEWS (nastily) If he comes in again -- I'll throw you. \nBefore Shorty can reply, Clews yanks his hat down over the little fellow's eyes, and gives him a backward shove that sends him sprawling into a corner where we leave him struggling to get his hat off. The crowd resents this, but doesn't dare do anything, except Cap, who holds his shotgun in sight. \nCAP (to the Clews) That does it, boys -- you know where the door is. \nGEORGE CLEWS (to Bob) Com-mon -- I'll get his ears. \nCAP Not until I get my money -- \nGeorge and Bob Clews are now a few steps from the bar. They have turned as Cap spoke and are looking at the shotgun. \nCAP There's three drinks and a broken beer glass. \nGEORGE CLEWS (to Bob, after a second's deliberation) Pay 'im. \nGeorge turns and starts for the doors as Bob comes back to the bar to settle up. \nGEORGE CLEWS I'll get his ears. \nON PAP FOSSLER AND THE OTHERS AT WINDOW - AS GEORGE CLEWS BURSTS OUT THROUGH THE DOORS \nPAP (quietly) That Rocklin'll kill him for sure. \nCUSTOMER Le's hope. \nEXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nAs George Clews steps outside, a mangy mongrel dog, basking close by, evidently recognizes him and tails it away, leaving George blinking at him. \nLONG SHOT \nRocklin -- FROM George's ANGLE. He is walking slowly forward down the middle of the street. \nMED. SHOT \nGeorge, looking baffled by the steady approach. \nGEORGE CLEWS (yelling) I'm coming -- and you'd better run! \nHe steps down from the sidewalk into the street and then stands still again. \nCLOSE SHOT \nRocklin -- CAMERA MOVING WITH him as he comes slowly and steadily forward. \nCLOSE SHOT \nGeorge. His hands are on his guns, but drunk or not, he has too much sense to draw too soon. \nEXT. STAGECOACH OFFICE - DAY \n", "test2_id": 1462, "test3_input": "ROCKLIN'S VOICE I came for that letter. \nMiss Martin reacts. \nINT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nSHOT -- Garvey and Rocklin. \nGARVEY (calmly) Did you say letter? \nROCKLIN That's right -- the one Miss Caldwell's aunt wrote from out east sayin' she was of age. Remember? \nGARVEY No -- I'm afraid I don't. \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nSHOT -- door. Miss Martin reacts with nod of satisfaction and leaves. \nINT. GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nRocklin goes to the filing cabinet where he opens the drawer marked \"C.\" As he fingers through the papers, Garvey sits back in his chair, watching. \nGARVEY What is your interest in this letter? \nROCKLIN My only interest is getting' it. \nGARVEY You realize what this is, don't you? -- Robbing -- armed robbery at that. \nRocklin pulls open the \"M\" drawer. \nGARVEY I warn you, you're in for a disappointment. \nNot finding the letter in the \"M\" drawer, Rocklin goes to the desk and pulls the handle of one of the drawers. It is locked. \nROCKLIN Open up. \nGARVEY (has had about enough) Listens, you -- (suddenly controls himself) There's nothing in there that'd interest you. \nROCKLIN (grimly) I'd like to make up my own mind about that. \nGARVEY (forces a chuckle) All right -- I'll open it -- just to convince you I'm not hiding any letter. \nGarvey unlocks the drawer and opens it. It is found to contain nothing but two brand new decks of playing cards. \nThe UNOPENED DECKS OF CARDS. \nBACK TO SCENE. Garvey seems a little too anxious to close the drawer, and before he can do so, Rocklin has one hand inside. Garvey, checked for a second, looks up at Rocklin. \nGARVEY What's the idea? \nRocklin slowly withdraws his hand, holding one of the decks. \nROCKLIN These cards -- \nGARVEY (attempting to bluff it out) Anything wrong in a man having cards in his possession? \nROCKLIN Depends on what kind they are -- 'specially when they're under lock and key. \nThe two regard each other silently a moment. Now Rocklin casually slips the deck he holds into his pocket. \nGARVEY (too politely) You're taking those, I presume. \nROCKLIN That's right. \nHe takes a step away. Garvey turns him by touching his arm. \nGARVEY (has had almost enough) Now, you look here -- \nROCKLIN (soberly) You're the one who better start lookin' -- lookin' for a way out for killin' Red Caldwell. \nGARVEY (blanches) Caldwell -- \nROCKLIN (takes up one of the decks of cards) He found out about these -- and you went and killed him. \nGARVEY (with an affected smile and unnatural calmness) And you believe a story like that? \nROCKLIN I will until I hear a better one. (puts deck he holds, in his pocket) I'll just take this along -- the district judge at Garden City should be mighty interested. \nHe starts around the desk toward the door. From the corner of his eye he catches Garvey reaching for a gun in the middle drawer. Before he can raise it, Rocklin is on him with a blow that sends Garvey reeling back toward the stove. \nRocklin starts for the door again, and just misses being struck by a chair which Garvey hurls with vicious fury. The chair crashes against a window. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe sound of breaking glass attracts the attention of passers- by, as well as Miss Martin seated in her surrey with Sammy, the K.C. China-boy. \nINT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe two are now fighting in earnest. \nVARIOUS FLASHES \nof the fight, intercut with townspeople gathering outside. \nEXT. STREET IN FRONT OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nDave pulls up in his wagon. \nINT. OF GARVEY'S OFFICE - DAY \nIt is pretty well wrecked. Rocklin has Garvey just about done in. He gives him one final Sunday punch and Garvey goes down and stays down. At that moment, Dave and Pap Fossler enter followed by other curious natives. \nDAVE Say -- looks like you two been disagreein' 'bout somethin' -- (to Fossler, who has gone over to Garvey) He ain't daid, is he? \n", "test3_true": "DAVE (to Rocklin) You musta found out somethin'. \nPAP FOSSLER (with a wink to Dave) I reckon the Judge did, too. \nThey exit, and almost immediately Miss Martin enters, and after gaping in horror at the appearance of the place, sees the Judge, who, having regained consciousness, bestirs himself on the floor. \nMISS MARTIN Oh, dear -- dear -- are you hurt? \nGARVEY (getting up painfully) Get out of my way -- \nGarvey, on his feet now, makes for the door leading to his living quarters at the back of the office. Miss Martin follows him. \nMISS MARTIN (haughtily) Now don't you use that tone of voice to me -- (going through doorway) I'll have you understand I -- \nShe sees the bed and shrieks upon realizing where she is, and backs out quickly, almost catching the door which Garvey slams in her face. \nEXT. MAIN STREET - SANTA INEZ - DAY \nRocklin and Dave as they walk from Garvey's office. Dave has a time hopping along against Rocklin's strides. \nDAVE -- Find out who owns that tobaccy pouch yet? \nROCKLIN (staring straight ahead) No -- but get hold of Clint Harolday. \nDAVE Clint -- Is he in on it? \nROCKLIN Can't say for sure -- Bring him to the Sun-Up, and don't take no for an answer. \nDave leaves and exits from shot in the direction of the stage office. Rocklin goes off toward the Sun-Up. \nEXT. SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nPANNING SHOT. Juan is lounging against the corner of the building, soberly watching Rocklin's approach. As Rocklin comes into the scene he spots Juan, and stops a moment as though deciding whether or not to question him. During this, Juan casually takes his ornamental tobacco pouch from his pocket and begins to roll a cigarette. \nThe CAMERA PANS Rocklin to the side of the building and up the outer stairs. \nINT. UPPER HALL - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nRocklin comes through the door and down the hall. He reaches his room, and is about to open the door when he hears a familiar voice inside. He listens. \nARLY'S VOICE -- So now you know the truth. And if you think you can steal him away from me, you're welcome to try it. \nRocklin frowns and enters. \nINT. ROCKLIN'S ROOM - SUN-UP SALOON - DAY \nRocklin steps into the room, holding the door partly open as he focuses his attention on Arly. Clara, who has been sitting in the rocker near the window, gets up and is the first to speak. \nCLARA (anxiously) Did you get it? \nRocklin closes the door. \nROCKLIN No -- but I don't think it's gonna matter much -- you go on back to the K.C. and I'll be out in the mornin' and take you with me to Garden City to see the district judge. \nCLARA But I hate putting you to that trouble. \nROCKLIN No trouble at all -- I'm going anyway. \nARLY (casually) You look like you've been fighting. \nROCKLIN (soberly) What are you doin' here? \nARLY I was just telling Miss Caldwell about -- well -- you and me. \nROCKLIN (his eyes narrowing) What about, you an' me? \nCLARA (sensing the static in the atmosphere) I think I'd better be going... \nROCKLIN (turning quickly from Arly) Just a minute -- (glances at Arly) What all has she been tellin' you? \nCLARA (embarrassed) Oh -- oh, really I'd rather not -- \nARLY (interrupting) Go ahead, tell him -- (looks at Rocklin and goes on defiantly) -- and I dare him to deny it. \nROCKLIN Deny what? \nCLARA That she was with you last night at the cabin in the mountains. \nROCKLIN Well -- why should I deny it?... \nARLY (quickly) And didn't you make love to me? \nROCKLIN (this is getting a bit thick for him) Make love to you -- \nARLY (forcing her point) You didn't kiss me -- I suppose? \nROCKLIN Did you expect me to deny that, too? \nARLY (smiles at Clara) You see? \nROCKLIN (to Clara) Now, maybe you ought to hear what I've got to say -- \nClara is terribly hurt, but struggles to be grown-up about it. \nCLARA Please -- you needn't explain. After all, it really isn't any of my business, is it? \nROCKLIN (in the pause he looks at Arly) You little -- \nARLY (quickly) That's it -- start swearin'-- (to Clara) Just like a man. \nROCKLIN If there wasn't a lady here, I'd do more to you than swear. \nCLARA I don't know how I can ever thank you for trying to help me. I do appreciate it ever so much -- (to Arly) Don't think too harshly of me, will you -- I -- \n", "test3_id": 1463}

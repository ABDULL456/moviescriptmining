It only goes one way. \nOTHER SLICK ESTATE AGENT Up. \nSLICK ESTATE AGENT I can't teach you how to skin a cat, but I can tell you a lot about the money in bricks and mortar.

The CHECHNYANS have suitcases handcuffed to their wrists. They speak in their native tongue. \nCHECHNYAN 1 Victor is Uri's right hand man, we served together for four years in Chechnya. We used to have a good time together, he's a real soldier, strong, hard, we made much trouble. I saved his life and he saved mine many times,... \nCHECHNYAN 1 pulls up his sleeve to reveal a massive tattoo. His arm is filled with slash marks on it. CHECHNYAN 1 (CONT'D) Caught in tank tracks!      He pulled me out and this one,... \nHe unbuckles his trousers and shows a massive gouge in his thigh. \nCHECHNYAN 1 (CONT'D) Stem grenade. \nCHECHNYAN 2 I have one of those,... \nCHECHNYAN 2 pulls up his trouser leg to reveal massive scars on his shin. \nCHECHNYAN 2 (CONT'D) How many of these have you got? \nROCKNROLLA \nPINK Revision   -   6-19-07                             65. \n92A    OMITTED                                                       92A THRU                                                                 THRU 92C                                                                  92C \n92D    INT.

We SEE One Two and Mumbles get out of their car and run over to the Range Rover on its side, they are carrying an axe and bolt cutters. Inside, CHECHNYAN 2 slowly opens his dazed eyes, to SEE an axe chopping through the window. TWO CHOPS and the window gives in. One Two leans in and grabs the case, but it's chained to CHECHNYAN 2's wrist. One Two pulls the arm out of the window and Mumbles uses massive bolt cutters to cut the case free. \nMUMBLES There's another case, grab it. \nOne Two leans in and grabs the second case from Chechnyan 1. As he is about to chop this one loose, he is pulled into the car by CHECHNYAN 2. \nONE TWO The bastard's still kicking.     Mace him, mace him! \nMumbles quickly moves around to the other window and sprays mace everywhere, including into One Two's eyes. \nONE TWO (CONT'D) Yaaaaaaaaaaaaaa, not me you idiot, the Guerrilla! \nCHECHNYAN 2 in the mean time has regained some of his strength and is still pulling One Two into the car with him. We can SEE Bob in the distance now next to their second getaway car looking concerned. \nONE TWO (CONT'D) Shoot him, shoot him, the bastards going to eat me! Mumbles pulls out a revolver, sticks it in the window and fires it into CHECHNYAN 2's leg. This just aggravates the CHECHNYAN. \n(CONTINUED) \nROCKNROLLA \nWHITE Revision    -   6-6-07                                  67. \n92F   CONTINUED:                                                          92F \nONE TWO (CONT'D) In his arms! \nBang. \nONE TWO (CONT'D) Arhhhhhhhhhhh.     That's my fuckin arm! \nOne Two manages to head butt CHECHNYAN 2 and goes back to reclaiming the case from CHECHNYAN 1. He pulls it out and Mumbles cuts the chain. One Two can't see a thing. \nHANDSOME BOB (CONT'D) Abandon ship! \n96   EXT. BOB'S GETAWAY CAR                                          96 \nOne Two gets caught in a head lock by CHECHNYAN 2, they struggle. Mumbles hits the CHECHNYAN from behind with a car Jack and CHECHNYAN 2 goes down again. One Two's eyes have just about come back. ONE TWO Run!     Run for your lives. \nThe crew split in DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS. Bob takes the cases and plucks some poor bystander out of their car and takes off. Mumbles disappears another way. CHECHNYAN 2 is up and follows One Two - terminator style, a foot chase begins. One Two, split from the group and being pursued, jumps over a wall. \nROCKNROLLA \nPINK Revision   -   6-20-07                           69A. \n97   EXT.

But no, CHECHNYAN 2 is over the fence, bullet proof vest flapping in the wind, and coming after him. One Two finds his strength this is his world, the world of the runner - he's off down the tracks. \n(CONTINUED) \nROCKNROLLA \nWHITE Revision    -    6-6-07                                70. \n97   CONTINUED:                                                         97 \nThe pair of them are bleeding profusely, they're bashed to a pulp, but they have still got a running sprit. The run goes on and on. CHECHNYAN 2 has ripped off his jacket, we can see his massive scar covered torso dripping in blood and sweat, he seems unstoppable. One Two gets confident and starts to run backwards egging CHECHNYAN 2 on, CHECHNYAN 2 is a good runner, but not good enough. Deep hate fills his eyes as One Two makes a fool out of him, CHECHNYAN 2 will remember this man. One Two is taking complete liberties, he almost stops and waits until CHECHNYAN 2 has caught up to him and then he tears off, the CHECHNYAN keeps coming. \nOne Two see's in the distance a tiny moped approaching from a distance, its CHECHNYAN 1 who completely out sizes the machine. However, he's moving and it's moving faster than One Two. One Two ducks off the tracks and over a wall, the moped gets nearer. At least when he gets over the wall, the moped won't follow right? One Two's over. He can hear the moped on the other side, One Two looks over his shoulder he can see the moped being lifted over the wall. \"Oh shit.\" This is where One Two's \"zone\" comes into play. He drifts in to a place that he can not be disturbed and he runs and runs and runs. Up, down, through and in. \n98   EXT.

He is on a motorbike that he has stolen. \nMUMBLES Get on! \nOne Two jumps on the back and they speed away leaving our Chechnyan's behind. \n99   INT.

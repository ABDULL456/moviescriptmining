RYAN Fuck. 
CRAIG GREGORY (AGREES) Yeah. (FORMALITY) Do you remember anyone giving you any signals of anything? Depression? 
RYAN They're all depressed. We're firing them. 
CRAIG GREGORY Hey, look, you know I have to ask. 
RYAN No, I don't remember anything. Of course they're upset. You never think that... 
CRAIG GREGORY Wasn't any woman who gave you any indication...? Anything? 
Ryan remembers her. 
RYAN No, nothing that stands out. (A THOUGHT) Is Natalie alright? Is she coming in? 
CRAIG GREGORY Natalie quit. 
Ryan isn't surprised. 
RYAN Just like that? 
CRAIG GREGORY Text message. 
Ryan stifles a laugh. 
CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) Yeah, real fucking nice, right? No one has manners anymore. 
RYAN She say where she was going? 
CRAIG GREGORY Nah. She was pretty upset. 
RYAN I should give her a call. 
CRAIG GREGORY (BUSINESS) I need you back in the air. 
Ryan doesn't react. 
CRAIG GREGORY (CONT'D) Did you hear me? I thought you'd be thrilled. 
RYAN I'm fine. What about video conferencing? 
CRAIG GREGORY CTC is pausing on the whole new media front for a moment. Giving it a little more thought. Getting our work horses back out doing what they do best. 
RYAN How long are you sending me out? 
CRAIG GREGORY We're going to let you sail and sail. Send us a postcard if you ever get there. 
Ryan absorbs this. Nods. 
INT. OFFICE, SAN FRANCISCO - DAY 
A MANAGEMENT LEVEL GUY sits at his desk. Bay Area sports paraphernalia on the wall. 
MANAGER So, what happened? 
We turn to reveal Natalie. 
NATALIE How exactly do you mean? 
MANAGER You graduated top of your class. You seemed to have your pick of employment... Including right here. Instead, you went to Omaha... to fire people for a living. 
NATALIE (OBVIOUS COVER) It's challenging work. 
MANAGER I can't imagine doing that day-in- day-out. Not in this climate. 
NATALIE (after a beat) ... I followed a boy. 
The manager smiles to himself. 
MANAGER Everybody does at one point or another. 
The manager raises a letter - It's Ryan's letter. 
MANAGER This guy says I'd be lucky to have you. 
INT. RYAN'S OFFICE, CTC - DAY 
Ryan writing the letter. We hear what he's writing... 
RYAN (V.O.) To whom it may concern, I can't even count the number of people I've fired in my lifetime. So many, that I've forgotten what it's like to actually hire somebody. We've never met, but I know you'd be lucky to have Natalie Keener. My advice? Take her and don't look back. She'll be the best decision you've made in a long time.

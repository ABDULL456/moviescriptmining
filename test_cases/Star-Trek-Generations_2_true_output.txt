KIRK (firm) I don't want to hear anymore about it. I'm not going, and that's final. 
7   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                           7 
The champagne bottle SMASHES onto the bow of a Federation starship(Excelsior class) sitting in its dock in orbit around Earth. 
7A   EXT. SPACE (VFX-I)                                          7A 
FOLLOW the shards of glass from the bottle as they spread over the ship...revealing the name on the hull: U.S.S. ENTERPRISE NCC-1701-B. 
8   ANGLE ON SPACEDOCK WINDOW                                    8 
A large picture window overlooking the starship in its berth. The window is filled with people in Starfleet uniforms, applauding the christening of the ship (but we hear nothing). 
8A   INT. SPACEDOCK OBSERVATION ROOM (VFX-I)                     8A 
The people are still applauding and we can see that they are looking out over the ship in its berth. 
8B   EXT. SPACE - ENTERPRISE-B IN SPACEDOCK (VFX-I)              8B 
The great ship sits in spacedock. 
9   INT. ENTERPRISE-B - BRIDGE                                   9 
CLOSE ON A SET OF TURBOLIFT DOORS as they slide open to reveal Kirk, Scotty and Chekov. A bright light shines into their faces and they react. MOVE TO REVEAL - that the bright light is coming from a futuristic CAMERA with a small bank of lights attached to it. The camera is a holographic recorder with two lenses and is worn on an operator's head. There are four JOURNALISTS clustered in front of the Turbolift -- one associated with the camera, the others using PADDS to make notations. 
Also clustered around the door are the BRIDGE CREW of the Enterprise-B. Everyone is APPLAUDING as Kirk and the others blink under the bright lights and ENTER the Bridge. 
JOURNALISTS (overlapping) Captain Kirk, how does it feel to be back on the Enterprise Bridge... Captain, can I have a Minute... Captain Scott, do you have any comment on... Commander Chekov... etc. 
CAPTAIN JOHN HARRIMAN pushes through the crowd. 
HARRIMAN Excuse me, excuse me...there will be plenty of time for questions later... 
The journalists edge away, and the cameraman moves to get a good angle. 
HARRIMAN (continuing, to all) I'm Captain John Harriman. I'd like to welcome you all aboard. 
KIRK It's our pleasure. 
Harriman is young, confident, eager -- this is his first command and he takes it very seriously. 
HARRIMAN I just want you to know how excited we all are to have a group of living legends with us on our maiden voyage. (beat) I remember reading about your missions when I was in grade school. 
The original Enterprise officers all stop and give him a look. Harriman looks a little embarrassed -- he didn't mean to insult them. But Kirk gives him a little smile, lets it roll off. 
KIRK Well... may we have a look around? 
HARRIMAN Please... please. 
Chekov sees someone in the background, calls out to her. 
CHEKOV Demora! 
Chekov moves off. 
JOURNALIST (breezy) So, Captain... this is the first Starship Enterprise in thirty years without James T. Kirk in command. How do you feel about that? 
The Journalist has unknowingly touched a nerve. Kirk's eyes flash for a moment -- the longer he's on this Bridge, the more he realizes he doesn't feel good about it at all. He tries to shrug it off with a smile. 
KIRK Just fine. I'm glad to be here to send her on her way... 
He tries to move away from the Journalist, who dogs him. 
JOURNALIST What have you been doing since you retired? 
KIRK I've been... keeping busy. 
At this point, Chekov approaches with a young, (mid- twenties) attractive, Asian female Ensign named DEMORA. 
CHEKOV (to Kirk) Excuse me, Captain. I'd like you to meet the Helmsman of the Enterprise-B. Ensign Demora Sulu -- Captain James Kirk. 
DEMORA It's a pleasure to meet you, sir. My father's told me some... interesting stories about you. 
Kirk is shocked. For a long moment, he stares at her in amazement. 
KIRK Your father... Hikaru Sulu is your father? 
DEMORA Yes, sir. 
CHEKOV You met her once before, but she was...

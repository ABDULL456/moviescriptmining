Jazz music plays on the radio. In almost all scenes inside of Bud's car, Jazz music will be playing on the radio. 
In this sequence the background changes from day to night, back to day, and back to night again (during the speed snorting scene) even though the dialog seems continuous. I believe that this was done intentionally to show the passage of time, but the disjointed events are cut so smoothly as to make it seem like they goofed the continuity. It's clearer in the TV version where there truly is a break between the line about speed and the actual snorting. 
OTTO So how much do I get paid, twenty-five buck a car. 
BUD Paid? You don't get paid. Are you kidding, you work on commission, that's better than getting paid. 
BUD Most cars you rip are worth two or three hundred dollars. Fifty thousand dollar Porsche (german pronounciation) might make ya five grand. 
BUD It helps if you dress like a detective, too. Detectives dress kind of square. People think this guy is a cop. They're going to think you're packing something. They don't fuck (mess) with you so much. 
OTTO Are you? 
BUD Am I what? 
OTTO Packin' something. 
BUD Ha. Only an asshole (a jackass) gets killed for a car. Guys who make it are the guys who get into their cars at anytime. Get in at three A.M. get up at four. That's why there ain't a repo man I know that don't take speed. 
OTTO Speed huh? 
Bud at payphone 
Bud is talking on phone. 
BUD I'll call you back! (hangs up) Flippin general telephone. 
Bud picks up phone and dials. Phone begins making a loud whining noise. 
Bud gets sledgehammer from car and destroys phone while Otto watches. When Bud is done, Otto gets crowbar from car and beats side of phone with it while laughing. 
BUD C'mon. 
Otto and Bud in car in alley 
(In the television version, this entire scene takes place while watching Bud's car drive down a road, but you can still hear the snorting in the background.) 
[BUD SNORTING A LINE Jesus Christ.] 
BUD Never broke into a car. Never hot-wired a car. Kid. I never broke into a trunk. I shall not cause harm to any vehicle nor the personal contents thereof. Nor through inaction let that vehicle or the personal contents thereof come to harm. That's what I call the repo code kid. Don't forget it etch it in your brain. Not many people got a code to live by anymore. 
BUD Hey! Hey look at that. Look at those assholes (that) over there. 
We see a group of people around a tow truck with a car being hooked up to it. 
BUD Ordinary  people I hate 'em.

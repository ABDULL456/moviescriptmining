196   CONTINUED:                                                    196 PHILLIP I'm sorry. BUTCH I know ya' are. Truth is, if it had to happen, I'm glad it was you. As opposed to someone I don't know, I mean. All things considered, I feel pretty good, though. Could use a beer, though. PHILLIP What's beer taste like? BUTCH Oh, it's about the best thing there is. You'd better put that on the list. Phillip's eye catches something.     He stands up fearfully... HIS POV - TWO MORE PATROL CARS lights spinning, rushing down the road, kicking up dust. 197   INT./EXT. RED'S PATROL CAR - DAY                              197 Sally watches Red. When the car comes to a stop, she reaches out and touches his arm. SALLY I think our chances of this thing ending peacefully are good. He smiles a lonesome smile, opens the door and exits. 198   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                          198 
Phillip kneels back down to Butch. PHILLIP You better run. BUTCH Naw, Phillip, I need me a time machine with a loud radio to take me where I'm goin'. Walkin's for squares. 199   EXT. MACK'S HOUSE - DAY                                       199 Red exits his patrol car, followed by Sally.     Agent Hendricks walks up. HENDRICKS Garnett, I'm Tom Hendricks, F.B.I., out of the Amarillo office. I understand you have one of our men with you? (CONTINUED) 
199   CONTINUED:                                                    199 RED Yeah.   You got the area quadroned off? HENDRICKS Water tight. Like a frog's pussy. (notices Sally) Sorry, ma'am. SALLY No doubt an observation based on personal experience. Red can't help but smile. RED You got him spotted? HENDRICKS By the creek, half-mile down the road. I spaced officers in a circle around them 100 yards or so away. RED You got any problem with me handling this one? HENDRICKS What say we both handle it? Red sighs. RED Let's head on down there.     Bradley, gimme' a megaphone. HENDRICKS One other thing, Chief. Haynes is wounded. The boy gut-shot him. RED Yer' shittin' me. 200   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                          200 Phillip scoops a handful of water and brings it to Butch, who opens his mouth and drinks, A megaphoned voice interrupts... RED (V.O.) (through megaphone) Butch, this is Red Garnett of the Texas State Police. A thin, knowing smile crosses Butch's lips. (CONTINUED) 
200   CONTINUED:                                                 200 RED (V.O.) I know yer' hurt. We've got damn near 100 armed men here. Take a look around and you'll see I'm shootin' ya' straight. BUTCH (yelling back) All this for me. I'm touched, but I'm afraid ya'll gonna' have to back it up a step or two. I'm headed to Mexico. (to Phillip) Lyin' to 'em, of course. 201   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                        201 
Red leans against a patrol car, accompanied closely by Adler, Sally and Hendricks. RED (into megaphone) Hate    to tell ya', Butch, but yer' headed the    wrong direction. Tell ya' what. You    let the boy go and we'll talk about it.     Discuss it over a cold beer. 202   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                       202 BUTCH (to Phillip) Beer. What'd I tell ya'. (to Red) Appreciate the offer, Cap'n, but ya' know I can't do that. If you and yer' pals back outta' here, I'll drop the boy at the border. (beat) If you don't I'll shoot him in the head. I mean it! Phillip, betrayed beyond comprehension, stares at Butch. BUTCH (to Phillip) Don't look at me like that. I don't even have a gun. What did ya' do with the pistola' anyway? PHILLIP Threw it in the well. BUTCH Good thinkin'. 
203   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          203 ADLER Ya' think he means it? Red mulls it over, replaces his old chaw with a fresh one and looks to Sally. RED What do you think? SALLY Based on what's happened the past two days I don't think he would. RED One thing's for sure. If he gets outta' here with the boy, we're right back to where we started. BRADLEY If he kills the boy he'll get the chair. ADLER Shit, he'll get the chair anyway.   He's killed two in two days. SALLY We don't know that he pulled the trigger on either of the innocent victims. ADLER Well he wasn't at home in his Strat-O- Lounger. 'Sides, who killed Pugh? Casper? RED All right, both of you, that's enough! From the trail of blood I got a feelin' it ain't gonna' make any difference. Let's jus' concentrate on gettin' the boy out for now. Bobby Lee approaches with a leather case, bypasses Red and goes straight to Hendricks. BOBBY LEE Where ya' want me, sir? RED Can you shoot off a hood? Bobby Lee nods. In the b.g., a HELICOPTER circles, preparing to land. (CONTINUED) 
203   CONTINUED:                                                   203 ADLER That'd be the boy's mother. RED Bring her on over. 204   EXT. CREEKSIDE - DAY                                         204 Butch and Phillip watch the helicopter land. BUTCH See, Phillip, dreams do come true. There's yer' rocketship. PHILLIP Think I'll get to ride it? BUTCH Today's the day. RED (V.O.) (megaphoned) Butch, we got the boy's Mama here. She wants to say something. Phillip is visibly stunned by the news. He crawls up to the crest of the creekside and squints, looking for his mom. BUTCH What's wrong, Phillip? PHILLIP It's my mama. Phillip still cranes his neck to see. 
BUTCH Now that ya' got yerself a ghost suit, do ya' think she'll let ya' trick r' treat? PHILLIP (better than none) I got to do one house. Butch smiles.   He has an idea. BUTCH Put yer' mask back on. 205   EXT. ROADSIDE - DAY                                          205 Bobby Lee carefully unsnaps the latches on his leather case and opens it on the hood of the patrol car. (CONTINUED)

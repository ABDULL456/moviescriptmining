59 CONTINUED: Charley straightens up, his gaze suddenly riveted to the screen. 
PETER (V.0.) But I do. Because I know they exist. I have faced them inn. all their guises, men, wolves, bats. And I have always won. That's why they call me The Great Vampire Killer. 
(DRAMATIC PAUSE) Now, watch me do it -- The horror flick comes back up on the screen, a much younger Peter stalking Dracula through a drafty castle, stake and mallet in hand. Charley watches the movie with renewed, if not fervent interest, whispering to himself as he watches. 
CHARLEY Get him, Peter,. get him -- 
DISSOLVE TO:

61 EXT. STUDIO PARKING LOT - DAY 
Peter comes out of the studio dressed in his street clothes, moping toward his car, taking a cigarette from his cigarette case as he goes. Eels in his fifties, tall, saturnine, by nature very theatrical, but at this particular moment in time, also very depressed. Charley jumps out from hiding and hurries toward him. 
CHARLEY Hey, Mr. Vincent -- Peter ignores him, continuing to walk-toward his car as. Charley falls in beside him. 
CHARLEY Could I talk to you a minute? (nothing from Peter) Please, Mr. Vincent, it's terribly important. Peter, abruptly stopped, resigned to the fact that boy is not going to let him alone. He whips out a fountain pen. 
PETER All right, what do you want me to sign? 
CHARLEY 
(CONFUSED) Pardon me? 
PETER Well, you want my autograph, don't you? 
(CONTINUED) 
61 CONTINUED: 
CHARLEY No, sir. I was curious about what you said last night on TV. You know, about believing in vampires. 
PETER What about it? 
CHARLEY Were you serious? 
PETER Absolutely. Unfortunately none of your generation seems to be. 
CHARLEY What do you mean? 
PETER (venting his frustra- tion on Charley) That I have been fired because no one wants to see vampire killers anymore. Or vampires either. Apparently all they want are demented madmen running around in ski masks hacking up young virgins. Now if'you'll excuse me -- Be starts for his car again, Charley falling in beside him. 
CHARLEY i believe in vampires. 
PETER 
(HARDLY LISTENING) That's nice. If only there had been more of you perhaps my rating would have been higher., 
CHARLEY In fact I have one living next door. Would you help me kill him ? That stops Peter cold. He turns and stares at the boy. 
PETER Pardon me? 
CHARLEY You know the murder of that girl that happened yesterday? 
PETER Yes. 
(CONTINUED) 
61 CONTINUED: (2) 
CHARLEY Well, the'guy who lives next door did it and he's a vampire. A moment. Then Peter turns away angrily. 
PETER If this is your idea of a joke, I am not amused. 
CHARLEY 
(GRABBING HIM) Mr. Vincent, I'm not joking. I'm deadly serious. Peter stares at him, sees he means it, and decides Charley's crazy. It makes him decidedly nervous. 
PETER - I'm sorry, you'll have to excuse me --

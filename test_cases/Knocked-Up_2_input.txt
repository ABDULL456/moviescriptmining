FEMALE NURSE This is Alison Scott. Please admit her into room 307. 
SAMUEL All right. Hi. 
BEN You're our nurse? 
SAMUEL That's why I'm holding the clipboard. So, uh, what else is up with you guys? 
KNOCKED UP - 125. 
Ben and Alison stare at Samuel. 
SAMUEL (CONT'D) I'm just joking. Let's have a baby! 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
Samuel is adjusting Alison's IV. 
SAMUEL So, I'm sorry it took me so long to find that vein. That little guy really didn't want me to find him. 
ALISON Is that the baby on that one right there? Alison points to some equipment by her bed side. 
SAMUEL Yeah. That's how we can tell how the little guy or gal is doing. 
ALISON Okay. A groggy Dr. Kuni enters. 
DR. KUNI Hello, Alison, Ben. Interesting night. 
BEN We really, really appreciate you coming, man. 
DR. KUNI What else do I have to do, I mean, besides sleep? I was only kidding. What happened to your doctor? 
BEN He's at a Bar Mitzvah in San Francisco. He didn't tell us though. 
DR. KUNI Nice. 
BEN Yeah. 
DR. KUNI Lucky for you I don't have any Jewish friends. 
ALISON Dr. Kuni, I really want to do this naturally. I don't want to use drugs. 
DR. KUNI Let's just take a look and see what happens, okay? Fetal heart rate is good. Samuel, where are we? 
KNOCKED UP - 126. 
SAMUEL Four centimeters. 
DR. KUNI Four centimeters what? 
SAMUEL Dilated. 
DR. KUNI Dilated. That's right. Focus. Pay attention, okay? We're a team. Okay? 
INT. HOSPITAL - WAITING ROOM 
Jonah, Jason, Jay and Martin sit in the waiting room. 
JONAH I want to get the fuck out of here. 
JAY What? 
JONAH I just want to get the fuck out of here. 
JAY Just relax, man, just relax. 
JONAH I don't fucking like hospitals. 
JAY Jonah, this is beautiful. I just think you need to relax and embrace the beauty of another life joining our gang. We're having a baby. We are having a baby. 
JONAH I'm not having shit besides a fucking panic attack. There's probably a fucking room back there full of dead bodies! You guys want to be here when one rolls out and just fucking coughs malaria into our face? 
JAY Jesus. 
JONAH Fucking shit. 
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM 
Ben massages Alison's back. 
BEN Is that good? 
KNOCKED UP - 127. 
ALISON Oh, yeah, get in there. 
BEN I could do this all day. The fetal heart monitors begins to BEEP. 
ALISON What was that? 
BEN What the hell was that? Samuel hurries in to check the monitor. 
BEN (CONT'D) What's that, what's happening? Dr. Kuni enters. 
DR. KUNI Well, boy and girls, what seems to be the problem? 
SAMUEL Decels. 
DR. KUNI Oh, dear. Okay. Alison, I need you to turn on your back now, okay? The baby's heart rate is slowing. Okay? 
BEN It's going to be okay. (to Dr. Kuni) Is it going to be fine? Alison turns onto her back. 
DR. KUNI It's going to be fine. Okay? 
(TO ALISON) You're going to feel a little bit of a push. Dr. Kuni tries to reposition the baby. 
BEN What are you doing? 
DR. KUNI I'm turning the baby so I can take the pressure off the cord. 
ALISON Oh, my God. The monitors stops beeping. 
KNOCKED UP - 128. 
DR. KUNI We're good. The heartbeat's stronger, but we're not out of the woods. We need to get things going now. I think the cord is wrapped around the neck. Okay? 
BEN What? 
DR. KUNI So I'm going to give you some medicine, pop the bag and get things going, okay? I don't want to leave the baby in there for long and we can give you some medicine for the pain. 
ALISON No, no, no, no. I don't want the baby to be born all drugged out. It's not my birth plan. 
DR. KUNI Now, things change. We don't have time to debate this.

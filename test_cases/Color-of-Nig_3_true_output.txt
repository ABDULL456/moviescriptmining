SONDRA Can't you ever be serious ?... 
BUCK Does a bear poop in the woods ? I sit next to Clark 
He moves to sit behind Clark. He lights a cigarette. 
CLARK And then smoke up a storm. My name is Clark. I'm a lawyer. And I... I have a compulsive obsessive disorder. 
CASEY So what's the problem ? He sneers. 
CLARK The problem is that if you and Buck are going to smoke in here, then the door to Doctor Moore's office must remain opened in minimum of fifteen inches. 
Buck comes and sits next to Casey. They smoke together. 
SONDRA I can't stand smoke... OK ? 
Buck and Casey puff clouds of smoke. 
CLARK And I would also like to suggest that you buy one of those ashtrays... 
SONDRA How come you don't listen to Clark ? How come you don't do anything about this, Bob ? 
CLARK ... that sucks up the smoke and purifies it. They cost nine dollars and ninety-nine cents, half of which is four- ninety-nine point five. 
CASEY HE LAUGHS He's going to open the door. 
CLARK One of you will have to pay an extra penny, but I'm sure you can work that out. CASEY He's going to open the door. 
CLARK I'm going to open the door. 
General laugh. Several incomprehensible words. We understand only Sondra's next reply. 
SONDRA You smell like an ashtray. 
CLARK You know, if you don't act more seriously in groups. 
Richie enters the room. 
SONDRA Hi, Richie ! 
BUCK He's back. 
CASEY He's back. 
BUCK Next time you get snot on the doorknob... 
SONDRA Come sit down here. 
BOB Bill... What would you like to tell us about yourself ? 
Richie walks behind Bill to reach his seat. 
BILL Well... I have plenty of problems... the biggest of which right now is jet-lag. So I think I'll pass for now, Bob. 
BOB Fair enough... 
BOB' OFFICE - MEETING ROOM - INTERIOR NIGHT 
The end of the preceding scene fades in the beginning of this one. We are now later in the same day. Night has come. The atmosphere seems more relax. Buck is half lying on a sofa. Sondra is finishing her story with a sweet voice, and does not simper anymore. 
SONDRA ...She's like a daughter to me... We hang out... Meaning that... It's wonderful... 
BOB He looks at this watch. Well, that's all for tonight. I'll see you all next week... BUCK Way to go. 
Bob gets up very quickly. Everyone does like him, but more slowly. Bob turns back before he leaves the room. 
BOB Bill... I'll be with you in a couple of minutes. Bill nods in agreement. 
SONDRA Bye...

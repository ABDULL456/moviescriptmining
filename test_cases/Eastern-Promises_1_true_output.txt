NIKOLAI (CONT'D) The hotel is called the Caledonian. 
Without a pause Anna leaves. 
82   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. S.C.B.U. CHRISTINE'S PRIVATE ROOM -82 NIGHT 
Anna is sitting on the bed beside Christine's crib. Christine is asleep. Anna is speaking into her cell phone, trying to keep her voice down. 
ANNA (into phone) ...no, I couldn't get much sense out of him, he was drunk. 
A pause.   Anna looks exasperated. 
ANNA (CONT'D) (into phone) Mum, I don't want to tell you how I found him because I don't want another argument. I just wanted you to know he's definitely safe... 
Anna listens with weariness. 
ANNA (CONT'D) (into phone) No, we can't tonight. I'm working. I need the money. (a pause) For a place of my own, for Christ's sake! 
She listens with growing anger until she finally cuts the call without a word. Christine stirs but doesn't wake. 
She leans back against the wall, already regretful. 
83   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL.    WARD OUTSIDE NIKOLAI'S ROOM -      83 NEXT MORNING. 
The ward is busy as Yuri, the police specialist from the Russian desk, enters wearing a heavy overcoat. He looks all around and approaches a nurse. PINK Revision    -   11/12/06                          89. 
84   INT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. WARD. NIKOLAI'S ROOM - MORNING       84 
Nikolai's drip is being removed by A NURSE. Nikolai is examining his healing wounds. Then through the glass of the door he notices Yuri, speaking to a nurse, and obviously recognizes him. 
The nurse points Yuri in Nikolai's direction. 
85   EXT. TRAFALGAR HOSPITAL. A FIRE ESCAPE LANDING - MORNING      85 
It's cold and the wind is blowing. We see rooftops behind them. Yuri is lighting Nikolai's cigarette. Nikolai is wearing Yuri's overcoat loosely over his hospital gown. Yuri lights his own cigarette and they smoke in silence for a moment. 
NIKOLAI You got my message? 
Yuri chuckles. 
YURI Using a dead body to file a progress report must be against FSB regulations. 
NIKOLAI It's called improvisation. 
YURI You've been improvising quite a lot lately. And taking risks. 
He glances at the cuts on Nikolai's hands... 
YURI (CONT'D) (in Russian) Maybe too many. 
Nikolai suddenly glares at Yuri. 
NIKOLAI (in Russian) You didn't come here to give me flowers... 
Yuri shakes his head and prepares to deliver bad news. Nikolai turns as if to go back inside. Yuri grabs Nikolai's arm and speaks formally....

YURI In light of what has happened to you... 
Nikolai shakes his head wearily.... 
NIKOLAI (in Russian) Ah, Christ... 
YURI ...and in light of other violent incidents associated with you, the Russian desk at Scotland Yard have made an official request to the Russian embassy that your undercover operation in London be terminated. 
Nikolai doesn't react for a moment. 
YURI (CONT'D) (in Russian) You have gone beyond what was agreed. 
With his cigarette dangling from his mouth Nikolai begins to unbutton his overcoat.. 
YURI (CONT'D) In my opinion you should see this as good news. You've been in the zone far too long... 
Nikolai turns and slowly pulls open the overcoat and the thin hospital gown beneath it. 
He reveals the eight-pointed star tattoos on his chest and Yuri reacts with absolute astonishment.

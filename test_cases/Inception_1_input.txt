COBB What're you doing? 
ARIADNE Improvising. 
She KICKS Fischer off the roof- AIMS again at Mal- 
Fischer DROPS as the sky LIGHTS UP WITH ELECTRICITY- Fischer SCREAMS, then GASPS, no longer falling, and we are- 
INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY 
Eames pulls the defibrillator from Fischer's chest as he COUGHS AWAKE. 
EAMES Get in there-quick! 
Fischer looks up at the double doors. STAGGERS to his feet. Fischer pushes open the doors to the STRONGROOM. 
INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Fischer walks into the silent white room. At one end of the room is a bed. A figure lies in the bed. His FATHER. Breathing with tremendous difficulty. Dying. And we- 
CUT TO: 
EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY 
Ariadne takes aim at Mal- 
COBB No! 
Cobb holds Ariadne's gaze. She lowers the gun. And we- 
CUT TO: 
Eames GRABS the detonator- then moves to the door of the strongroom... 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELEVATOR, HOTEL - NIGHT 
Arthur HITS THE DETONATOR- 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - CONTINUOUS 
The CHARGES on the bottom of the elevator EXPLODE, and we move into EXTREME SLOW MOTION as the flames BALLOON- 
CUT TO: 
INT. STRONGROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A RUMBLE BUILDS as Fischer approaches the bed, overcome with emotion. His Father sees him. Starts trying to speak. Fischer leans in... 
FATHER (hoarse whisper) I... was ... dis ... dis ... 
FISCHER I know, Dad. You were disappointed that I couldn't be you. 
The dying man SHAKES HIS HEAD with surprising energy. 
FATHER (whisper) I was disappointed... that you tried. 
Fischer hears this. And we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - NIGHT 
The elevator car is ROCKETED along its track by the explosion- 
INT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS 
Arthur is SMASHED against the floor of the car next to the sleepers who SHUDDER with the force of ACCELERATION- and we- 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANTECHAMBER - DAY 
Eames WATCHES Fischer- 
EAMES (to himself) ) Come on, come on... 
INT. STRONGROOM - DAY 
The Father collapses back onto the pillow. Fischer starts to weep. His Father reaches out a trembling hand but when Fischer tries to hold IT, he SHAKES his son's hand away... 
He is reaching for the SAFE next to his bed. His fingers fumble at the keypad, he can't open it. His son pushes 5,2,8,4,9,1 into the keypad. Opens it. Inside the safe is the WILL. And beside it is a HOMEMADE PINWHEEL, clearly made by a child. By Fischer. He takes it out, MARVELING at it. He turns to his father, but his father is dead. 
Eames, watching from the door, HITS THE DETONATOR- 
EXT. HOSPITAL COMPLEX - CONTINUOUS 
A line of EXPLOSIONS RIPS ALONG THE LOWER WALL... the ENTIRE BUILDING STARTS TO SLIDE DOWN THE MOUNTAIN- 
EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY 
A FIERCE WIND starts HOWLING through the house as the sky outside DARKENS. Cobb shields Mal against the blast- looks up at Ariadne, who HOLDS the railing, FIGHTING the wind- 
COBB That's the kick-you have to go! 
ARIADNE You're coming! 
COBB No, I'm not. I'm staying here to find Saito. (turns to Mal) And to say goodbye. 
Ariadne loosens her grip on the railing... 
ARIADNE Don't lose yourself. Find Saito. And bring him back. 
COBB I will. 
Ariadne lets the wind pull her off the edge- FALLING- and we- 
INT. ANTECHAMBER - CONTINUOUS 
Ariadne DROPS as the FLOOR COLLAPSES- her eyes SNAP OPEN- 
EXT. PENTHOUSE (LIMBO) - DAY 
Cobb holds Mal in his arms. The wind DIES... 
MAL We'd be together forever. You promised me. 
COBB I know. But we can't. And I'm sorry.

MATT walks nervously around, holding the headset.  Everybody's eyes are on him. 
MATT Well, it occurred to me that we could use the overhead crane to load the admin module onto the back of Big Bertha.  That way we could put a bit of distance... 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER 
MATT (CONT'D)   (O.S., on speakers) ...Between us and the station.  Least 'till the guys from Fort Powell arrive. 
HIROKO That sounds promising.  Can we operate the crane from here? 
DRISCOLL Nah.  It's got programmable facilities, but it was never rigged for remote operation.  Someone'd have to go up to the cab to get it up and running. 
HIROKO Which mean physically going outside. 
DRISCOLL looks around uneasily. 
DRISCOLL Yeah. 
INT.  RYUSHI STATION - COMMAND CENTER - LOWER DECK 
A small group of people, most of whom we saw in the Command Center, are clustered around a section of the poorly-lit maintenance corridor. HIROKO's wearing a black hi-tech catsuit, a fetishist's dream.  Across her shoulder is a pistol in a slung bandolier holster.  She nods at a pile of clothing in DRISCOLL's hands. 
HIROKO Is this the suit? 
DRISCOLL Uh-huh. 
She takes it from him.  Slides her legs into the bottom half and pulls it up.  YORK watches with an expression of incredulity etched on his face. 
YORK This is fuckin' lunacy!  You're not gonna make it across the platform on foot! 
CASSIE Shut up, York. 
HIROKO No, he's right.  Has anyone got a bike near here? 
A REDHEADED GIRL looks around hesitantly, then raises her voice. 
REDHEADED GIRL I have. 
HIROKO Let me have the keys. 
The GIRL rummages in her pockets and throws the keys over.  HIROKO puts them in a pocket on the suit's sleeve. 
HIROKO (CONT'D) Which one is it? 
REDHEADED GIRL Uh... the Hyundai racer.  Yellow and black stripes. 
YORK Oh, yeah.  Real inconspicuous... 
HIROKO Listen, I don't care if it's pink and purple polka-dots as long as it gets me there in one piece.  Somebody loan me a headset. 
CASSIE pulls off hers and hands it over.  DRISCOLL's watching HIROKO fasten up the suit.  He spots a mistake. 
DRISCOLL No, go back.  Second clasp from the bottom. 
HIROKO finds the offending clasp and locks it. 
HIROKO How much air-time have I got? 
CASSIE About thirty minutes.  Those are slimmed-down tanks, so no stopping to admire the scenery. 
HIROKO Deal. 
CASSIE We've dumped the whole data-base from one of the cleaning remotes into the helmet. It'll project the route through the sewer system onto the inside of the glass as you go. 
DRISCOLL Yeah, I stripped down a motion tracker and hardwired it through to the helmet pick-ups, too.  That's also on the display. 
HIROKO Sounds great. 
PARSONS It's not all good news.  We had to take off the helmet lights.  You'll be going in blind. 
HIROKO What?  Why? 
DRISCOLL We had to.  They were just too cumbersome for some of the conduits you're gonna have to negotiate.  Besides, all the crap floating around reduces visibility to the extent where I doubt having helmet lights would have make that much difference, anyway.  Maintenance lights down there oughta be enough to do the trick. 
HIROKO How tight are these shafts? 
CASSIE and DRISCOLL exchange worried looks. 
CASSIE Tight.  We chose a route we felt would reduce the chance of you running into any Aliens. 
HIROKO takes a deep breath.  Beads of perspiration dot her forehead. PARSONS nods.

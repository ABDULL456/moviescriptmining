DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) You were in the diner with that hot girl. Thor doesn't like where this is going. 
DRUNK TOWNIE (CONT'D) I wouldn't mind her doing a little research on me. He laughs. Thor is annoyed. 
THOR I have no quarrel with you. But she's a lady. You should be more respectful. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 80A. 
DRUNK TOWNIE And you should shut the hell up, princess. Selvig looks to Thor, concerned that he's going to lose it. But, to his surprise, Thor remains unaffected by the Townie's baiting. 
THOR I will not fight him. 
DRUNK TOWNIE Then it'll be easy to kick your ass. Selvig stands, steps between the two men. 
SELVIG Gentlemen, please. Let's keep our heads. Just then, Selvig HEAD-BUTTS the Townie, knocking him out. Thor's impressed. Selvig downs his drink, then hurls his glass aside, SHATTERING it on the ground.

SELVIG (CONT'D) 
(TO THOR) Another drink? 
98 EXT. MAIN STREET - NIGHT 98 
Thor and Selvig stumble down the street, singing a NORWEGIAN FOLK SONG. They improvise an impromptu drinking song dance routine involving side steps and happy slaps, optimistically in time with the song. 
THOR/SELVIG 
(SINGING) "The mood is good, our hearts are full, there's magic in the air. / It's all because we're here tonight, and haven't got a care. / So raise a glass, and toast to life, wherever it may lead / Tra-la- la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed. / Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, a friend is fine indeed!"¬ù Thor holds up a hand for Selvig's last finishing slap. Selvig misses it completely and falls out of frame like a straight dead weight with a CLUNK. WIDE SHOT. Emerging from behind the car where Selvig fell, Thor stands up, Selvig slung over his shoulder, and starts to walk up the street towards Jane's trailer. 
99 INT. JANE'S TRAILER - NIGHT 99 
The small trailer is in a state of perpetual disarray, strewn with various books, old pizza boxes, etc. A worried Jane lies on her bed, trying to read. She's startled by the loud RAPPING on the door. She bolts to the door and opens it to find -- 
THOR Standing there with the unconscious Selvig slung over his shoulder. 
JANE Erik! 
(TO THOR) Is he all right? 
THOR He's fine. Not injured at all. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 81A. As Thor enters, he BANGS Selvig's head on the doorway. Selvig GROANS. 
THOR (CONT'D) Sorry, my friend. 
JANE What happened? 
THOR We drank. We fought. He made his ancestors proud. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82. 
JANE Put him on the bed. Thor moves through the small trailer carrying Selvig, like a bear lugging another bear, smashing into things along the way, until he finally sets Selvig down on Jane's bed. Selvig awakens groggily and looks up at him through bleary eyes. 
SELVIG I still don't believe you're the God of Thunder. 
(THEN) But you ought to be. Thor grins, pats him on the cheek. As Selvig drifts off to sleep, Thor pulls a blanket over him. Jane watches, stunned by their friendship, impressed by Thor's tenderness. Thor turns back to her, looks around. 
THOR These are your chambers? Jane suddenly becomes self-conscious. She starts cleaning up the mess around her. 
JANE Well, it's more of a temporary living space, really. I don't usually have visitors in here. Actually, never... Thor picks up a sock off the floor. She snatches it from him, puts it away. 
JANE (CONT'D) Can we go outside? 
100 EXT. SMITH MOTORS - ROOF - NIGHT 100 
Thor steps off a ladder onto the roof of Smith Motors. He offers Jane his hand, helps her up. There's a telescope set up, a couple chairs, some blankets. 
JANE I come up here sometimes when I can't sleep. Or when I'm trying to reconcile particle data. Or when Darcy's driving me crazy. 
(THEN) I come up here a lot, now that I think about it. Thor looks at the night sky, filled with stars. 
4th BLUE REVISIONS 03-26-10 82A. 
JANE (CONT'D) I'm glad you're safe. 
THOR You've been very kind. I've been far less grateful than you deserve. 
JANE I also hit you with my car a couple times, so it kind of evens out. He grins, then reaches into his pocket and pulls out her 
NOTEBOOK. 
JANE (CONT'D) I don't believe it... She takes it from him, surprised and grateful. 
THOR It was all I could get back. Not as much as I promised. I'm sorry.

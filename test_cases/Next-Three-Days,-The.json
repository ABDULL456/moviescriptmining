Can you forget about ever seeing your parents again. Can you kill a guard, leave your kid at a gas station, push a nice old lady to the ground because she is between you and the door?

And again he looks at the bank, tapping his toe manically. A guard opens the bank door for a departing customer, smiles and heads back inside. John tightens his grip on the gun, tries to work up his courage, but ultimately realizes he can't do this. \nFurious with himself, he jams the car into reverse and backs up without looking. He hears a scream, brakes hard and looks. \nA WOMAN screams. John stomps on the brakes. He leaps out of the car and sees a woman dropping her groceries and scooping her child up in her arms. Call her ELAINE. \nELAINE What are you doing?!   You almost killed us! \nJOHN Are you --? \nELAINE Are you out of your mind?!   You don't look?! \nShe stoops to grab the few items that fell.    He tries to help. \nJOHN I am so sorry -- \n(CONTINUED) \n185   CONTINUED:                                                          185 \nELAINE Get away!     Get away from us! \nShe stands and runs for her car. John returns to the car and sits, leaving the door open and the door alarm screaming. He sits there, letting the failure and his disgust for his weakness wash over him. \n186   INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- AFTERNOON                          186 \nJohn sits in the children's area, waiting for the line of visitors to get shorter. One look at his face and we can see how tortured he is. He has his cell phone to his ear: \nMEYER (O.S.) I'm sorry. \nJOHN No, it was a long shot.       Thanks. \n187   INT. CRIMINAL COURTHOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                              187 \nMEYER (into phone) How's Lara? \n188   INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- CONTINUOUS                         188 \nJOHN She's okay.     Thanks, Meyer. \nJohn hangs up and stands. \n189   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- AFTERNOON               189 \nJohn stands in the corner, staring out through the high, thick windows. He turns as he hears Lara and other prisoners coming. He tries to smile, but she knows something is wrong. \nLARA What's wrong? \nJOHN Nothing. \nLARA Is it Luke? \nJOHN No. He's fine. I had Meyer see what he could do about not getting you moved. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n189   CONTINUED:                                                         189 \nJOHN (CONT'D) I told him traveling that distance would be a hardship on us, that Luke was already having trouble at school. Which is true. I haven't been spending enough time with him. \nLARA You haven't? YOU haven't? God, John, you are too much. Luke is having a 'hard time' because mommy is in jail for murder, not because daddy doesn't spend enough time with him! Your father was right, you don't live in the same world we do. \nJOHN (stung) That's nice, that the two of you talk. What world do I live in, Lara? \nLARA I don't know, but it's not the real one. I am in here for the rest of my life! And you want me to believe in some fantasy that -- ! \nA guard steps up and raps her knuckles on the table to get their attention. Only John looks up. \nFEMALE GUARD We good here? \nJOHN Yes.   Sorry. \nLara lowers her voice a little, but not her intensity.    The guard walks away under: \nLARA Now you come here all long-faced, like you've let me down. What do you want me to do, make you feel better? \nJOHN Got it.   I'm sorry. \nLARA And now you're apologizing.   You really are a gem. \n", "test3_id": 626}

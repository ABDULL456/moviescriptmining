{"train": "JOHN Three, and I have papers to grade. Can you pick up Luke? \nLARA After yesterday I probably don't have a job anyway. Do you think it was wrong to call her a useless cow? \n(CONTINUED) \n9    CONTINUED:    (2)                                               9 \nJOHN Bosses admire that kind of frank exchange. \nLARA (pulls note off fridge) Did you call your father? \nJOHN When? \nLARA (heading for bathroom) \"When?\" Yesterday, for his birthday! \n10   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM                                   10 \nLara puts her foot up and jabs herself with insulin. \nJOHN (O.S.) I sent him flowers and a handmade card. \nLARA You're completely impossible. \nJOHN (O.S.) Did you notice what I got for my birthday this year? A grunt. \n11   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN                                    11 \nJOHN Mom said Happy Birthday and my father went . Made me tear up. \nLara returns, trying hard not to smile. \nLARA Ever think that someone has to be the bigger person here? \nJOHN (to Luke) Remember this for the custody hearing: how Mommy is always scolding Daddy. \nLARA How are you going to feel if Luke grows up and doesn't call you? \nLara can't keep a straight face and heads to the foyer. \n(CONTINUED) \n11   CONTINUED:                                                        11 \nJOHN Now she's driving a wedge between us. \nLARA I give up. \nJOHN And now she is abandoning you. \nLara grabs her raincoat and notices a stain on the back shoulder. Irritated, she heads back to the bathroom. \n12   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM                          12 \nLara rinses the stain under the sink, surprised to see it run red. She looks at her hands: blood. The doorbell rings. \n13   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN                                      13 \nJohn rises to answer the door. \n14   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWNSTAIRS BATHROOM                          14 \nLara looks at her coat, wonders how the hell she got blood on her shoulder. She rubs liquid soap into it. \n15   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER                                        15 \nAs John opens the door, DETECTIVE QUINN shows his badge. DETECTIVE COLLERO and a team of detectives push past. John has no time to react. \nDETECTIVE QUINN Police.   Mr. Brennan? \nLUKE sees the police rush past him and gets scared. \nDETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D) My name is Detective Quinn. This is a search warrant for these premises. \nJohn hears Luke cry and instinctively heads inside. \nDETECTIVE QUINN (CONT'D) (stops him) Stay where you are. \nJOHN Get your -- \nDETECTIVE QUINN Touch me again and you'll be arrested. \n16   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - DOWN THE HALL                                  16 \nLara steps from the bathroom and is met by Detective Collero. She sees the coat with the water spot; nods to a team member, who takes it and bags it under: \nDETECTIVE COLLERO Lara Brennan? \nLARA WHAT?! \nDETECTIVE COLLERO Lara Brennan, you are under arrest for the murder of Elizabeth Gesas. \nShe takes her wrist and professionally turns and cuffs her. \nLARA She's dead??     Elizabeth is dead?? \n17   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - FOYER                                          17 \nJOHN (tries to push past) She didn't do anything! \nDETECTIVE QUINN I will only -- \nJOHN (tries again) She didn't do anything! \nJOHN Every night at bedtime. \nLARA What are you building?    A fort? \nLara pulls him into a hug; no response. She kisses his head and sits at the table with John. She squeezes his hand. \nLARA (CONT'D) Was he scared going to school? \nJOHN I walked him to class, gave him a kiss; he didn't even look back to wave. \nLARA What did you make him for lunch? \n(CONTINUED) \n24   CONTINUED:                                                       24 \nJOHN Turkey sandwich, just butter and bread, no \"vegetables\" on it. He swore he ate his apple. \nHe hands her a pack of photos.      Lara devours them. \nLARA Look at his friends.   And his desk. This is his teacher? \nJOHN Miss Phillips. \nLARA You may have to move to another school district. \nJOHN Already spoke to a realtor. \nLARA (still looking at photos) How was your first day? \nJOHN Excellent. Over half my class stayed awake. Talked to your mom. \nLARA When is she coming? \nJOHN She's having a lot of trouble with her business. \nLARA It's only been a couple of years, I'm sure she'll get around to it. (beat) Have you heard anything? \nJOHN About the appeal? Yes, and I'm just not telling you. What did Meyer say? \nLARA --Don't-- \nJOHN -- It can take months for the court to rule. \n(CONTINUED) \n24   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 24 \nLARA I saw that woman. She was there. She couldn't have just disappeared. \nJOHN Meyer's looking for a new investigator. \nLARA Her coat snagged my purse, I felt a button pop - they must have been blind not to find it. \nJOHN He'll go through all the evidence again. \nLARA Great, because I haven't quite bankrupted us yet. \nJOHN We're doing fine. \nLARA (fondly) You just lie and lie. (strokes his face) But you are very handsome. (admiring him) Can you do me a favor? \nJOHN I don't know, I'm a little busy. \nLARA I need you to run for governor. \nJOHN -- Oh, that I can do. \nLARA You can change this rule about no conjugal visits, because I don't think I can last another twenty years. \nShe smiles but is already traveling toward a dark place.    He reaches out and holds her tight, stroking her back. \nLARA (CONT'D) I'm okay.   I'm okay. \n(CONTINUED) \n24   CONTINUED:    (3)                                               24 \nJOHN I know. But it's going to be fine. I promise. \nShe just stares at Luke, his back to them, playing. \nLARA You think he'll ever want to kiss me again? \n25   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CONTACT VISITING ROOM -- LATER               25 \nThe prisoners file out and are patted down. Lara turns and blows Luke and John a kiss. They watch with the other visitors, who all stand on the far side of the room. \n26   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CHANGING ROOM -- MOMENTS LATER               26 \nLara and the female inmates pull off their visiting jump- suits and hand them to a female guard, who searches them for contraband. Lara retrieves her regular jump-suit and pulls it on over her underwear. Another small, daily humiliation. \n27   INT. JOHN'S BATHROOM -- NIGHT                                   27 \nStart VERY CLOSE ON JOHN'S DIGITAL WATCH. Widen to see Luke standing on a low step at the sink in his pajamas using a complicated-looking electric toothbrush. John sits on the toilet, staring at his watch. \nJOHN Twenty-eight, twenty-nine, thirty. \nLuke puts it down and checks his teeth in the mirror. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Good? \nLuke nods. \nMEYER That it no longer matters what we believe; Lara's not getting out. And you have no idea how much I hate saying that. \nJOHN (exiting) I'll find someone to file the pleadings. \n(CONTINUED) \n31   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                   31 \nMEYER John! Come on! For Christ's sake. JOHN!! \nJohn is long gone.    Meyer hurls his sandwich into the trash. \n32   INT. COUNTY JAIL - VISITING BOOTHS -- DAY                           32 \nJohn waits alone on the visitors' side of the glass. The door opens, and Lara steps up on the other side. John smiles and picks up the phone, but Lara sees something in his face and doesn't pick up her phone, just stares at him. \nJohn fights to keep his smile and nods for her to pick up her phone -- but now she can see the verdict chiseled on his face. Lara gasps and cries inconsolably. \nJohn keeps the smile plastered on his face, but now tears run down his cheeks. He taps on the glass and points at her phone, but she doesn't respond. He taps harder and harder -- desperately wanting to comfort her, but she won't allow it. \nHe bangs on the glass with his fist, drawing the attention of the guard on his side. \nLara turns and exits. John stands and yells her name, but she can't hear it, and neither can we. \n33   EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY                                33 \nWe're in an old working class neighborhood.    John sits in his car, trying to pull himself together. \n34   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY                                34 \nMICK opens the door. GRACE, their mother, looks up from clearing the lunch dishes. John's face tells them everything they need to know. Mick slams his fist against the door. \nIn the back yard with Luke, GEORGE, John's father turns to see Grace tearfully embrace John. George looks away, uncomfortable, and distracts Luke's attention. \n35   EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE - BACK YARD -- LATE AFTERNOON         35 \nJohn, Mick and Grace sit in the worn wicker chairs on the back porch. Erit steps out with beers to replace their empties. She sits and they stare off, watching Luke and George play with the dog. After a moment Erit looks to John: \nERIT I know you won't want to hear this... \n(CONTINUED) \n35   CONTINUED:                                                       35 \nMICK -- Erit, go put somebody to sleep. \nShe stares unbelieving, then walks off in a huff. \nJOHN Thanks. \nMICK Had to be done. (long beat) I am really going to pay for that. \nJohn has to smile. \n36   EXT. THE HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT (DUSK)                           36 \nJohn drives through a rough part of town on their way home. He stops at a light and notes the dealers on the corner. A flashy car pulls up, hands are slapped; call the driver DAVID. He takes a roll of cash from the dealer, looks around, catches John staring. John looks away quickly and drives off. \n37   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                     37 \nJohn sits at his desk, surrounded by boxes of documents and photographs. As John sifts through the evidence... \n38   INT. LARA'S OFFICE - THE PAST -- NIGHT                           38 \nLara and her boss ELIZABETH argue loudly. \n39   EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT                          39 \nIt's RAINING outside. ELIZABETH stands at her car door in a small, partially covered garage -- maybe a dozen spots. She turns toward camera -- \nA FIRE EXTINGUISHER comes right at camera, making a terrible impact and \nELIZABETH collapses to the floor. \n40   EXT. PARKING GARAGE - THE PAST -- NIGHT                          40 \nLara turns, holding the fire extinguisher. \n41   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                41 \nAs he flips through a handwritten witness statement. \n42   EXT. PARKING LOT - THE PAST -- NIGHT                            42 \nLara's car speeds out of the parking lot. A male co-worker steps out of the rain just as her car passes. He stops as he sees ELIZABETH'S BODY lying beside her car. \n43   INT. BRENNAN HOUSE - BATHROOM - THE PAST -- DAY                 43 \nLara tries to scrub the blood off of her coat. \n44   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                    44 \nThe phone beside him SHRIEKS.   John picks it up. \n45   EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- NIGHT          45 \nIt's late; prime time for the ER.    John runs in. \n46   INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR -- NIGHT               46 \nJohn enters breathlessly and finds the Nurses' Station. \nJOHN Lara Brennan; my wife. She was sent up here. Brennan. B-R- \nAnd then a female hand appears beside him, opens another drawer and reaches in. John stares at the hand, afraid to move, afraid to look up. The hand finds a tube of glue, places it on the counter and moves away. \nJohn turns to see LARA walking away. She turns, smiling and shaking her head, and disappears into the dining room. \nStunned, John looks down at the glue on the counter, then suddenly pushes away and rushes into the dining room. No sign of her. And she isn't in the living room. He bolts into the foyer and finds the front door slightly ajar. He flings it open... \n52   EXT. BRENNAN HOUSE -- NIGHT                                       52 \nJohn rushes out into the street, looking up and down for her -- finally realizing she was never there. \n(CONTINUED) \n52   CONTINUED:                                                         52 \nHe stands in the middle of the street, now searching for some way to survive. \n53   INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - JOHN'S CLASSROOM -- DAY                   53 \nDon Quixote is written on the chalkboard. \nJOHN So, what is it about?   Julie? \nJULIE That belief in someone's virtue is more important than virtue itself? \nJOHN No. I mean, yes, that's in there. But what is it about? \nNo takers. \nJOHN (CONT'D) It is about how rational thought destroys the soul. It is about the triumph of irrationality, and the power that is in it. \n54   INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - LIBRARY -- DAY                            54 \nJohn drops an armload of books into a library cart, each having something to do with prison or prison life. \nHe sits at a table at the back, flipping through them one at a time and discards each in turn. \nAs the shadows grow longer we find him staring at the computer screen linked to the school system. \nON THE SCREEN: a book summary disappears, to be replaced by the school search engine -- many of the items have already been inspected. John finds one that reads \"Over The Walls.\" \nHe clicks on the link and the title page appears. The author is DAMON PENNINGTON. There's a photo of him. The caption reads that he LIVES IN BROOKLYN, NY. \n55   EXT. BROOKLYN, NEW YORK - STREET -- DAY                            55 \nJohn gets out of a cab and heads into a local dive bar. \n56   INT. BAR -- DAY                                                    56 \nA couple of guys at the bar yell at the dog race on the TV screen. DAMON hands John a beer and nods toward a table. \n(CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED:                                                          56 \nJOHN It's a course that investigates what drives men to be free, no matter the cost. \nDAMON Somebody else had dibs on Papillon? \nJOHN You escaped from jail seven times. \nDamon lights a cigarette.       A TOUGH GUY nearby objects. \nTOUGH GUY No smoking!! \nDAMON Yeah, who would want to cut short your precious life? \nDamon takes a deep drag. \nJOHN Mind if I tape you? \nDAMON Go for it, it can't be used as evidence. What do you want to know? \nJohn sets up the small digital recorder. \nJOHN How you escaped when no one else could. \nDAMON Balls and a little luck. (beat) No prison in the world is airtight. Each one has a key. You have to find it. \nJOHN How do you do that? \nDAMON A lot of looking. Especially at things that break the daily routine. Guards get comfortable doing the same thing every day. Something happens where they have to think, adapt. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \n56   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 56 \nDAMON (CONT'D) That's when they will make mistakes. But when you see it you have to be ready. You have to have the entire plan already in place before you even know how you are going to get out of the jail. Escaping is easy; the hardest part is staying free. \n57   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                      57 \nThe tape recorder plays Damon's voice; John tears large sheets of art paper from a pad and tacks them to his bedroom wall. \nDAMON (O.S.) You have to know where you are going to go and how you are going to get there. You have to know how they plan to catch you, where, and when. \nJOHN (O.S.) How the hell do you know that? \nHe starts to write on the paper with a large felt marker. \nDAMON (O.S.) You pay off someone who knows. And a lot depends on if the prison is in the country or the city. \n58   INT. BAR -- DAY                                                   58 \nJOHN The city. \nJOHN How much? \nDAMON Enough to last at least five-six years. Run out of money and you run out of friends. \n75   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                75 \nJohn underlines \"MONEY.\" \n76   INT. BAR -- DAY                                             76 \nJohn is starting to understand the enormity of this undertaking. \nDAMON But before you do anything, you have to ask yourself if you can do it. Can you forget about ever seeing your parents again. Can you kill a guard, leave your kid at a gas station, push a nice old lady to the ground because she is between you and the door? Because to do this thing, that's who you have to become. And if you can't, don't start, because you'll just get someone killed. \n77   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                     77 \nJohn backs away from the wall to see it covered in a spiderweb of notes. \nJOHN (O.S.) How did you get caught? \n78   INT. BAR -- DAY                                                  78 \nDAMON I gave myself up. I couldn't take wondering when someone was going to come through the bedroom door. (beat) Got what you need? \nJOHN Yeah. \nDAMON What do you have in your pocket? \nJohn opens his billfold.   Damon takes the cash, leaves him a twenty. \n79   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                     79 \nOn the wall we see the massive diagram John has created. The screen goes BLACK. Read: \nTHE LAST THREE MONTHS \n80   EXT. T-TRAIN -- DAY                                              80 \nThe train crosses a bridge. \n81   INT. T-TRAIN -- CONTINUOUS                                       81 \nJohn rides, looking down at the river below. \n82   INT. COUNTY JAIL - ENTRY HALL -- DAY                             82 \nJohn steps through the puffer (the machine that detects drugs) and into the secure area. He makes a mental note of everything he sees: the number of guards, cameras, etc. \n83   EXT. COUNTY JAIL - DELIVERY AREA -- DAY                          83 \nJohn sits in his car on the road above, surreptitiously taking pictures of the vehicles coming and going from the prison. \n84   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                        84 \nHe tapes the photos to the wall. \n85   INT. COUNTY JAIL -- DAY                                             85 \nWalking down a corridor with the other visitors, John steps in a puddle of water. Behind him the others notice and step around it. Moving on, they pass a trustee on a ladder pulling a water-stained ceiling tile away as two guards watch. \n86   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                        86 \nJohn traces a route on a map with a highlighter. \n87   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY (NEW DAY)                                87 \nThe wall grows thick with photos and notes. \n88   INT. CLASSROOM -- NEW DAY                                           88 \nHe reads an article on his computer -- about illegal aliens and fake ID's. \n89   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT                                        89 \nJohn enters his bedroom and closes the door. We see how dramatically his plan has evolved on the wall as every inch is covered in notes, photos, maps, and various writings. He studies it as he bites into a sandwich. \n90   INT. COUNTY JAIL - CORRIDOR -- DAY                                  90 \nJohn and Luke walk near the front of the group of visitors toward the visitation rooms. \nJust ahead he notices a guard using a key to call the elevator. John stops near the elevator and kneels, pulling one of Luke's shoelaces loose. \nLUKE It was already tied. \nJohn reties the lace as the group moves on.    He keeps one eye on the elevator. \nThe door opens and the guard   steps in - and John notices two WORKMEN in hardhats inside.    The elevator closes, the shoelace is tied, the group has moved   on down the hall and they are alone. John pulls the laces    and unties Luke's shoe. \nLUKE (CONT'D) You untied it again! \n(CONTINUED) \n90   CONTINUED:                                                       90 \nThe guard looks back, now impatient. John offers a smile and throws a look down at the elevator tread, sees the name: OTIS ELEVATOR COMPANY. Suddenly a voice comes from behind: \nWOMAN'S VOICE Mr. Brennan? \nStartled, John turns to see DR. LIFSON. \nDR. LIFSON We met briefly. Byrdie Lifson. \nJOHN Oh, sorry.    Hello, Doctor. \n96   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- LATE AFTERNOON                            96 \nJohn uses Photoshop, looking through family pictures for an appropriate one to use for Lara's ID. Some of them are of the family at a cottage. He finds one that will work and starts to crop himself and Luke (as a baby) out of the photo. Then he turns and notices Luke standing behind him, staring at the screen. \n97   EXT. PITTSBURGH -- DAY                                           97 \nA helicopter swoops over a bridge and traces the Monongahela River through the city. On the door of the helicopter is emblazoned the name of a local tour company. \n98   INT. HELICOPTER -- DAY                                           98 \nJohn sits among six other passengers. \nCOPTER PILOT On the left, Allegheny County Jail. Built in 1995, it is now the largest jail in the world. There have been three escape attempts. No one's made it out alive. On your right... \nEveryone else looks to the right as the pilot continues. John stays fixed on the left window. \nHIS POINT OF VIEW: \nThe massive rooftops of the jail. But then he sees exactly what he is looking for: workmen wearing yellow helmets spread hot tar and roofing paper. He spots a workman carrying a bucket heading around a tall outcropping on the roof. \n99    INT. COMMUNITY COLLEGE - CLASSROOM -- DAY                          99 \nLYLA, a student, reads from The Idiot as John returns to his desk with papers in his hands. His laptop lies open to Google Earth -- the rooftop view of the jail, from another angle. John closes it and spreads the papers on his desk -- a printed color version of the same. He draws an arrow to the outcropping where we now see a door; labels it ELEVATOR. \nLYLA On the first landing, which was as small as the necessary turn of the stairs allowed, there was a niche in the column, about a yard wide, and in this niche the prince felt convinced that a man stood concealed. He thought he could distinguish a figure standing there. \n100   INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM -- DAY                                         100 \nJohn searches Craigslist for HELICOPTER PILOTS.

The bartender gives him a beer on tap. John asks for \"Hart.\" The bartender nods to a man at the back who is playing a video game. John walks off, passing a LONG-HAIRED GUY at the bar who watches him. John approaches HARV. \nJOHN Mouss said to come see you. \nHARV He did, did he? What do you want? \nJOHN Three passports, a driver's license, and real social security number. \nHARV How do you know Mouss? \nJOHN He babysits my kid. \nHARV (sizes him up, then:) Okay. \nJOHN (to Luke) Give Grandma a kiss. \nLuke does, and the two of them leave with his bag. \n116   EXT.

He rings the bell again. \nJohn runs and snatches a kitchen knife, returns to the door, secures the chain lock and opens the door a crack. \nJOHN What? \nMike speaks in a loud, atonal and unnerving voice. \nMIKE I was at the bar.    I know what you are looking for. \nCaught off guard by the voice, John just stares at him. \nMIKE (CONT'D) I'm deaf, you idiot. I read lips. \nJohn stares at him, unsure what to do. \nMIKE (CONT'D) You really want to talk out here? \nJohn puts the knife in his back pocket and steps out onto... \n122   EXT.

Don't come here again. \nMike stares at him.      John stares back. \nMIKE Parking lot of Don's. Eckert Street. Under the bridge; two o'clock.

BRENNAN HOUSE - KITCHEN                                        125 \nHe drops the carving knife back in the drawer.

STREET - UNDER A BRIDGE -- DAY                                 126 \nJohn waits for the janitor to leave his tiny office and grabs the door before it closes.

He's blaming the lab; the lab's blaming him. But I'll be fine. Thanks. \nAnd she walks off.    John gets in the car and slips the gun between the seats. \n140   INT.

Are you ever going to answer your goddamn phone? \nSuddenly a man in a helmet raps on his side window and John realizes MIKE has pulled up without him noticing. His hand goes to the split between the seats, but stops short as the SECOND RIDER pulls up to the passenger window. \nMIKE You were supposed to leave. \nJOHN I need them. \nMIKE You notice that guy was a cop? \nJOHN Which guy? \nMIKE The one with the red light in his back window. \nJohn feels ridiculous.       Mike hands him the documents. \nMIKE (CONT'D) Just give me the money. \nJohn hands him the envelope of money.       Mike checks it. \nMIKE (CONT'D) You want this too much. You're going to fuck it up. \nMike speeds off. The second rider gives John a look and follows. John looks over the passports with their new names. \n144   INT.

He hands the dish to the guard. \nJOHN How are you doing today? \nGUARD Don't touch that. \nJOHN Sorry. \nJohn puts the dish down, and we see the bump key is gone -- John palmed it.

John knows he can't let his brother see this. \nThe MALE NEIGHBOR in the house to the south opens his door and looks out and scowls. \nMALE NEIGHBOR What's your problem?

Luke trots up. \nLUKE Can I have my cookies? \nJOHN You hungry?    You want your sandwich? \nLUKE No. \nJohn hands him two packaged cookies. Luke runs off and hands them to Carrie. Her attractive young mother, Nicole, sitting a couple of benches down, calls and draws John's attention. \nNICOLE Carrie! (to John) I'm sorry. She just already has it all figured out.

He opens it and sees a birthday invitation with jungle animals on the cover. \nJOHN He has his father's memory. \nNICOLE It's for Carrie's birthday party. Please come; I'd love to meet your wife. \nJOHN I'm afraid she can't be there. ...It's complicated. \nNICOLE I understand. With me, too. Carrie, come on, time for lunch.

We paid for dinner with the cash from her wallet. \nShe sits back a bit to look in his face. Only now, looking in his eyes, a crack forms in her tough exterior. \nLARA (CONT'D) I'm sorry.

GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- DAY                                 195 \nGrace opens the door. George stands a few steps behind her, quiet. Grace sees John and is immediately concerned. \nJOHN Hi Mom. \nGRACE What are you doing here? \nJOHN I've got class. \nGRACE Five o'clock at night? \n(CONTINUED) \n195   CONTINUED:                                                          195 \nJOHN Yes. (kisses Luke) Bye. \nLuke runs in as John walks off. \n196   EXT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- CONTINUOUS                         196 \nJohn's father watches through the window as his son leaves. In his gut, George knows something is wrong. \n197   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                         197 \nJohn sits in his car down the street, watching the corner where he noticed kids selling drugs. \nA car shows up - the same flashy car he saw weeks ago. The street dealer looks around, runs to the window, makes an exchange, and then the car drives off again. John checks his watch and settles in to wait. \n198   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                         198 \nJohn watches as other cars drive up and score drugs. And then finally the flashy car cruises up again. John checks his watch: it has been two hours. Again the street dealer runs up and hands the driver an envelope. We recognize the driver -- he is the one from earlier, whom we are going to call DAVID. He drives away. John follows. \n199   EXT. HILL DISTRICT -- NIGHT                                         199 \nJohn follows the flashy car at a distance.    It stops at another corner and something is exchanged.    It drives on; John follows. \n200   EXT. HILL DISTRICT - NEIGHBORHOOD -- NIGHT                          200 \nNot the best part of town. It looks rough even for The Hill. The flashy car parks and David crosses the street. \nHalf a block back, John turns left at the corner and then makes a quick right into the alley. He guesses how many houses from the corner David stopped, gets out and checks over the fences. \nHe stops a few houses away when he sees the porch light on a house flick on. David waits on the dilapidated back porch. He waves to whoever is watching him through the pinhole and the light goes out again. \n(CONTINUED) WHITE    9-10-09                                                68. \nNabulsi sees the brightly painted walls of the child's room. \nLT. NABULSI He have a kid? \nSGT. HARRIS Neighbor said wife left with him last year. Big surprise there. \nLT. NABULSI They type all this blood yet? \nSGT. HARRIS No, but someone left through the back door bleeding. Zone Three found a gunshot victim dead on a transit bench. \nNabulsi nods and descends the stairs. \n216   EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- NIGHT                                      216 \nJohn snips the links of a tall chainlink fence, then turns and walks back to the Prius. \n217   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S HOUSE -- NIGHT                             217 \nJohn eases open his parents' front door and removes his key from the lock. It's the middle of the night, so he is surprised to see a light on in the kitchen. He enters, carrying his jacket and backpack, and places them on a chair. When he gets to the kitchen he sees his father in his pajamas, reading a biography and sipping a cup of tea. \nJOHN Hi.    What are you doing up? \nGeorge shrugs.     An uncomfortable silence. \nJOHN (CONT'D) I've come to get Luke. \nGeorge nods. After another silence, John starts down the hall. His father appears in the hallway behind him. \nGEORGE John?    Are you alright? \nJohn turns around, surprised. \nJOHN I'm fine. \nThe two men look at each other for a moment, John leaves the room. \nHis father steps into the living room and notices his jacket falling off the chair. George lifts it to set it right and sees something is sticking out of the backpack: airplane tickets and passports. \n218   INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                                 218 \nJohn steps into the room that he had as a teenager. Luke sleeps in the single bed. John sits beside him, touches his face, then looks around the room, wondering how he got here, and is overwhelmed. \n219   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S LIVING ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                  219 \nGeorge slips the tickets and passports out of the side pocket. We do not see the destination, but he does. He opens the passport and reads each of the false names. \n220   INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- CONTINUOUS                               220 \nJohn brushes away tears, no idea how he could be acting like this. He tries to wake Luke. \nJOHN Hey.   Hey, buddy. \nNot a chance. John checks the old alarm clock: it's just after three AM. He lies down beside Luke for just a moment. \n221   INT. JOHN'S OLD ROOM -- NIGHT                                    221 \nJohn WAKES to the sound of a whistle. He checks the clock. It's almost five. How could that have happened? \n222   INT. GRACE AND GEORGE'S KITCHEN -- NIGHT                         222 \nJohn helps a sleepy Luke with his jacket, pancake rolled in his hand. John stands from the table strewn with food. \nJOHN What do you say? \nLUKE Thank you. \nJOHN Give Grandma a big kiss. \nLUKE I'm too tired to kiss. \nJOHN Luke... \nGRACE I'll get lots of kisses next weekend. (to John) We want to take him to the Harvest Festival in Kutztown, where they have the Clydesdales. \nJohn thinks about saying something, can't.   He watches Luke give Grace a kiss. \nLUKE Thank you, Grandma. \nJohn turns to his father, who stands in the doorway. \nHis father holds out the jacket in silence. John takes it. The airline tickets stick out from the inside pocket. \n(CONTINUED) \n222   CONTINUED:                                                            222 \nJohn realizes the tickets have been moved from the bag. He looks at his father, who gazes back at him in silence. John can tell by the look in his father's eye that he knows. \nJOHN Bye Mom. \nThey kiss.    John's father stands behind him. \nGEORGE Goodbye. \nGeorge grabs his son in an awkward hug.      John is shocked. He pats his father's back. They break. \nJOHN (to Luke) Let's go. \nJohn leaves.      The front door closes.   Grace walks away. \n223   EXT. DOWNTOWN STREET -- PRE-DAWN                                      223 \nJohn stands in the brightly lit, glass-walled kiosk of a rental car company, the Prius parked at the curb, as the sun threatens to break over the horizon. \n257   EXT.

Lieutenant, the prisoner is secure; jail personnel are 10-27, Code 4. A squad car will meet you at the entrance. \nNabulsi puts the walkie down and flips on the siren.          Harris reacts. \nSGT. HARRIS She just said -- \nLT. NABULSI Run the light. \n258   INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - ROOM 7725 -- DAY                             258 \nA second handgun and holster      slides across the floor to meet the one that already lies by      John's feet. The two guards kneel, facing the far wall.       John pulls a roll of duct tape from the backpack and tosses      it to the terrified nurse. \nJOHN Tape their hands and feet. (when he hesitates) Do it!! \nThe nurse tapes the guards' wrists behind their backs. \nLARA You have to stop this. \nJAIL GUARD #1 You walk out that door with him and you will both be killed. \n(CONTINUED) \n258   CONTINUED:                                                                258 \nJOHN Tape their mouths! \nJohn picks up the key and undoes Lara's cuffs. \nLARA No.   Stop. \nJohn yanks her clothing and a white smock out of the bag and tosses them to her. \nJOHN Put it on. \nLARA WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS?! \nJOHN Because we have no other choice!! Put it on! (to nurse) Turn around. \nHe does, John starts taping his wrists. \nJOHN (CONT'D) Lara, put the clothes on! \nLARA No. \nJOHN NOW!! \nLARA No! \nThey stare at each other.         John offers her his cell phone. \nJOHN Okay. Tell your son you aren't coming. \nLARA ...Where is he? \nJOHN Waiting for you. Tell him you aren't coming. \nLARA How can you do this to me? \n(CONTINUED) \n258    CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 258 \nJOHN Push send. Tell him I'm not coming back either. \nLARA John -- \nJOHN Does it look like I'm going home?! Tell him he is alone now and his mother and father aren't coming back! \nLara stares at him with hatred, mutters: \nLARA You son of a bitch. \nLara pulls off her prison garb, standing before them naked except for her panties. She quite purposely does not turn away or cover herself, but lets her eyes burn into him. John presses the STOPWATCH button on his watch and the COUNTER starts running. \n259    EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ENTRANCE -- DAY              259 \nA squad car pulls up outside the hospital's main entrance. One officer strides into the Emergency Room while the other takes a look around the parking lot. \n260    INT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - SEVENTH FLOOR HALLWAY                  260 \nLara and John step out into the hall. John's eyes flick to the Nurse's Desk but he keeps walking. As they pass we notice DR. LIFSON standing there with Lara's file in her hand. The Duty Nurse notices as well. It takes a second for Lifson to understand what is going on. She steps out into the hall and stares after them. \nDR. LIFSON What are you doing? \nJohn yanks Lara's arm and makes a dash for the elevator, pulling his gun from his pocket. \nThe Duty Nurse sees what is happening and bolts down the hall, throwing open the door to room 7725. \n260A   INT. HOSPITAL - 7TH FLOOR ELEVATOR LOBBY                          260A \nThe elevator doors are closing as John arrives and jams his arm in between them. The passengers see the weapon. \n(CONTINUED) WHITE    9-10-09                                            91. \n260A   CONTINUED:                                                        260A \nJOHN Get out!    Get out! \nThey scurry out and the doors close. A heartbeat later the next elevator opens and the cop from downstairs steps off. \n271   INT. ELEVATOR - LOBBY LEVEL -- CONTINUOUS                         271 \nThe doors open. John peers around the corner, hiding his weapon. No police in the lobby, but through the glass doors he sees a squad car screeching to a halt. He grabs Lara's hand and leads her out of the elevator and around the corner. \nThey weave down a corridor, deeper into the hospital, passing another cop at the Emergency Desk who has his back to them. \nThey turn the corner, see a hospital guard running toward them. John recognizes him as the guard he argued with when Lara attempted suicide. John stiffens, but the guard runs past -- looking for a couple in lab coats. They quicken their steps. The guard stops at the end of the hall and turns to stare, recognizing them. He lifts his walkie and speaks. \nHOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 Main floor, rear corridor. \nJohn and Lara turn a corner. John spots the SHIPPING OFFICE. They enter and head for the loading bay. \n272   INT. HOSPITAL LOBBY -- CONTINUOUS                                 272 \nNabulsi and Harris break into the lobby, sweating. Officers run in the front doors toward him. Nabulsi surveys the scene, realizes they couldn't have gone out the front. He hears a shout: \nHOSPITAL SECURITY GUARD #1 (O.S.) Back here! \nThey turn and run in the direction of the voice, turning the corner and seeing the SECURITY GUARD at the end of the hall, who sees them coming turns and runs off after John and Lara. \nLT. NABULSI (into radio, on the run) Get units to Grant Street! \n273   EXT. HOSPITAL LOADING DOCK -- CONTINUOUS                          273 \nJohn punches open the door and they hop down off the dock and take off for the street. \n274   EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                    274 \nJohn tugs Lara across the street, dodging traffic. He yanks off his jacket and pulls it back on inside-out -- this side is black and gold. \n275    EXT. REAR OF UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                        275 \nNabulsi runs out of the loading dock and into the middle of Grant Street, HARRIS and the two OFFICERS trailing. Very few pedestrians right here. Nabulsi looks to his right: a crowded crosswalk, fans heading through a pedestrian mall to a Penguins game. He looks to his left: more fans moving toward the stadium. Almost all of them are wearing team colors - a sea of black and gold. Nabulsi curses. \n276    EXT. NEARBY PEDESTRIAN MALL -- DAY                                    276 \nLara and John weave through the fans. \nJOHN Put your hair down. \nLara obeys without thinking. John checks his watch, then opens a door. Leaving the throng of fans, he guides Lara through and down the stairs into the T-Train Subway Station. \n277    EXT. UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL -- CONTINUOUS                                277 \nNabulsi runs to the crosswalk as Harris takes the other direction. The other two officers take the far sidewalks. \n278    INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS                             278 \nJohn and Lara quicken their pace.    The camera tilts up and to the glass ceiling. \n278A   EXT. PEDESTRIAN MALL -- CONTINUOUS                                    278A \nNabulsi searches the faces in the mall. He looks down through the station skylight, catches a fleeting glimpse of them. He runs for the entrance, his walkie flying to his face. \nLT. NABULSI They're on the platform! Block stations in either direction! Call the Port Authority. Stop all trains! \n279    INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS                             279 \nJohn sees a train approaching as they come down the stairs.

UNIVERSITY HOSPITAL - MAIN ENTRANCE -- CONTINUOUS             280 \nWalkie in hand, Harris jumps into their unmarked car and pulls out. Two SQUAD CARS wail out past him.

Lara sees him tighten his fingers around the grip. The doors finally close just as: \n283   INT. T-TRAIN SUBWAY STATION -- CONTINUOUS                          283 \nNabulsi bounds down the stairs. The train leaves the station. Nabulsi leaps down onto the tracks and chases it. \n284   EXT. T-TRAIN STATION -- DAY                                        284 \nThis station sits above ground.

HARRIS' UNMARKED CAR -- CONTINUOUS                            289 \nHarris screams along the road on the far side of the tracks. He locks up his BRAKES as he sees the stalled T-Train.

SUV - DRIVING THROUGH INTERSECTION -- MORNING                300 \nJohn brakes as he spots a State Trooper vehicle at an intersection. As he keeps an eye on the rearview mirror, the squad car puts on its flashers, turns and follows them. \nJohn's hands tighten on the wheel. He keeps the speedometer at 35, praying he's not their target. \nThe police vehicle passes them and takes off fast down the four lane street. \nJohn breathes again and drives on. He checks the stopwatch - 29 minutes flicks to 30. He pushes the button on the GPS. \nGPS VOICE Time to destination: eleven minutes. \nLara sees him sweat, unaware of the significance of the time. \n301   EXT.

Interstate: Keep Right; Zoo: Next Left. \nJohn keeps driving, hoping somehow that he won't have to make this choice -- their freedom, or their son. \nToo many questions rage across his face. Perhaps they can escape and his parents can somehow arrange to get Luke to them. Or perhaps Luke would be better off with his grandparents after all. \nThen there it is: \nThe sign to the interstate points to the entrance ahead on the right. \n(CONTINUED) \n302   CONTINUED:                                                        302 \nThe sign to the Zoo sits behind it, pointing to the next road on the left. \nJohn takes the freeway ramp. \n303   EXT.

I promise I will find a way to get Luke to us. I will find some way. \nLara unsnaps her seat belt. She reaches for the door latch. John sees her pull the door and GRABS her by the shirt as he slams his foot on the brakes! \nThe tires SCREAM, the SUV skids into an uncontrolled turn. \nHorns blare. Cars behind them swerve to avoid collision. John holds Lara in her seat as the SUV flies around in a circle and finally comes to a dead stop on the shoulder, miraculously facing in the right direction. \nJohn allows himself to breathe. He lets go of Lara's shirt. She opens the door and steps out. \nJohn closes his eyes and tries to gather himself back together. He opens his door and steps out. \n305   EXT.

John nods to him that everything is okay and comes around the bumper to find Lara sitting on the gravel shoulder, leaning against the back tire, staring out at the field beyond. He sits beside her in silence. \nBehind them the cars whip by.    No one even thinks to stop to see if they need help. \nLara and John watch a cow in the farmer's field. \nLARA John? (no reply) What are we going to do? \nJOHN (finally) We're going to the train station. \nJohn turns right, heading downtown. \n312   INT.

JOHN is attractive in a worn kind of way, but has the eyes of a kid with a discipline problem. You have to really know him to understand if he is mocking you or agreeing with you. He is a master of irony and has a true enjoyment of the absurd. LARA looks beautiful even in her wrinkled suit. She appears to have had a hard day at the office. She's been drinking at dinner; it hasn't eased her nerves. John's good-looking brother, MICK, boasts his blue collar roots and a gorgeous, if slightly trashy, girlfriend, ERIT, who isn't ashamed of her body or sharing her opinions. JOHN and MICK are laughing. Lara puts cash on the tray beside Mick's credit card. \nLARA You know what? If you were smart you would stop talking right now. \nERIT Sue me. I just know that women should never work for women. \nJohn laughs and applauds.   Mick buries his head. \nLARA How can you say that?? \nERIT They're always threatened.

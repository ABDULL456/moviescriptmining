YUPPIE SCUM (to Real Theodore) Call my assistant and ask her what floor we're on. 
REAL THEODORE Who's your assistant? 
YUPPIE SCUM The girl you party with every night. 
REAL THEODORE (to himself) Who? 
TED I'm here alone, sir. 
REAL THEODORE It's room 404, I think. 
YUPPIE SCUM I could have sworn we were on the fifth floor. 
REAL THEODORE Right. 404. 
YUPPIE SCUM (into phone) Right. 404.

CUT TO: 
STORY TITLE CARD: 
ROOM 404 "THE WRONG MAN" 
INT. DARK HALLWAY 
Ted saunters down a hallway with a butt hanging out the corner of his mouth and a bucket of ice swinging at his side. He pulls up at a door on which the faded numbers read something like "Room 404." 
Ted knocks on the door. After a moment, the latch is thrown and the door swings open. Ted cautiously steps into the dark room. 
INT. ROOM 
TED Anybody home? 
A DEMONIC CACKLE cuts through the darkness. 
MAN'S VOICE No one here but us chickens. 
TED Say, it's pretty dark in here, sir. 
MAN'S VOICE What do you expect, Theodore, a fuckin' floor show? 
TED Do I know you? 
MAN'S VOICE I don't know. Do you? 
In a flash the lights switch on and Ted finds himself staring down the barrel of a pretty intense-looking .357 Magnum, cocked and ready to fire. At the other end of the gun stands a 50-year-old man, Sigfried, who sports a Cheshire Cat smile and a "just try fuckin' with me" look on his face. Sigfried isn't the only person in the room. Directly behind him sits a beautiful young woman, Angela, gagged and bound to a chair. Ted drops the bucket to the floor. 
TED I brought your ice. 
SIGFRIED That's cute. In fact, the whole getup's kind of cute. The monkey suit's a nice touch, honey puss. 
TED This has to be a mistake. Is this room 404? 
SIGFRIED Theodore? What do you take me for, Theodore? 
TED A very upset man? 
Sigfried reaches in his pocket and throws a handful of assorted stimulants into his mouth, chewing on them like they were breath mints. Sigfried thrusts his hand forward, gripping Ted by the throat, and leads him to Angela. 
SIGFRIED (to Angela) I am an upset man, Theodore. 
TED How do you know my name, sir?

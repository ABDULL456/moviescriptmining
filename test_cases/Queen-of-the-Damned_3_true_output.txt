Jesse stares into his entrancing grey eyes, tries to gather herself together, half fearful, half titillated. They gaze at each other, the air suddenly electric. 
JESSE You saved me. 
LESTAT Perhaps... So you know Marius... 
Jesse notices her rucksack cast aside by the Punk Vampires -- Lestat's journal sticks out. She glances at Lestat. He mustn't see it. She steps away, tries to distract him. 
JESSE I know a lot of things. 
He gazes at her. Moves closer, breathing her in, making her flustered. He smiles. 
LESTAT Not how to stay alive apparently. 
JESSE Well I guess we've got that in common. Although I think I'm a little ahead in the race here. 
LESTAT (a beat, surprised at her brazenness) Well, I can fix that. 
He circles her. Jesse is shaking, terrified. Enjoying the game, Lestat smiles, moves closer. But Jesse suddenly blurts out. 
JESSE 'Mine eyes dazzle, she died so young.' It's about the girl with the violin, isn't it? 
That stops Lestat. He gazes at Jesse, surprised. Recovers his composure. Stares at her intensely, regarding her anew. 
LESTAT Is it? And what else do you think you know?

JESSE (desperate, stalling) I... I think you're a lot like Marius, Lestat. 
LESTAT (staring into her eyes, probing) Am I?   Tell me all about it. 
JESSE You're... you're both artists.   He's a painter. You're a singer... 
As she speaks, Lestat guides Jesse over to a pile of crates. She stares at some beer bottles shattered on the top of one. He guides her hand downward, closer to the shattered glass. 
LESTAT Is that so?   What I do is art, is it? 
JESSE Yes... From nothing... you try to create... something beautiful... (shaking now as her hand gets closer and closer) ... out of the... the cold, dark wasteland of eternity... 
He stares at her, the words oddly familiar, then scrapes her finger along the bits of broken glass, gravel. She gasps with pain... 
Lestat gazes at the drops of blood that appear, glistening on Jesse's finger... 
LESTAT (softly) Something beautiful... 
JESSE (quickly) But... but Marius isn't a rebel. You're different in that way. You don't want to hide, follow the laws, concealed in the shadows like some insect. You... you still want to walk with the living, don't you, Lestat?

He stares into her eyes, slowly brings her bleeding finger toward his mouth. 
LESTAT Well, I'm not hiding now, am I? 
As her bleeding thumb gets closer and closer to his mouth... 
JESSE No, but the only time you're not really alone is when you kill... But, Lestat, you can't help it... it's not your fault... He made you this way... 
LESTAT (with her blood on his lips, shakes his head) Ah.    Poor, poor me... 
As he brings her finger closer and closer to his mouth. 
Their eyes bore into each other, he stares at her rosy cheeks, the cold sweat on her forehead, taking in her remarkable, if foolhardy daring. Her eyes gazing straight into his... 
He brings her bleeding finger into his mouth.       She may swoon. 
Lestat's eyes burn as he tastes her for mortality, her fragility a brief second, listening to her blood. there's something there that surprises him as he gazes at this mortal girl. He feels something. Desire... 
Then her blood speaks to him as Lestat's eyes fall on her rucksack. He sees the journal. It all falls into place. 
Lestat's lip curls in anger. He shoves Jesse away. Wipes his mouth. The mood suddenly changes. 
LESTAT Well, Talamascan, you're certainly a very clever librarian, aren't you? 
She stares at him, found out. He turns from her, laughing, but not the kind of laugh to make Jesse think all's well.

LESTAT (shaking his head) How sad, you people always trying to know the unknowable... So, was it a good read? My diary. 
Jesse slowly nods, admitting to all.    He shakes his head.

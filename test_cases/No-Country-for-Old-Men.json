{"train": "NO COUNTRY FOR OLD MEN \nWritten by \nJoel Coen & Ethan Coen \nBased on the Novel by \nCormac McCarthy \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MOUNTAINS - NIGHT \nSnow is falling in a gusting wind. The voice of an old man: \nVOICE OVER I was sheriff of this county when I was twenty-five. Hard to believe. Grandfather was a lawman. Father too. Me and him was sheriff at the same time, him in Plano and me here. I think he was pretty proud of that. I know I was. \nEXT. WEST TEXAS LANDSCAPE - DAWN/DAY \nWe dissolve to another West Texas landscape. Sun is rising. \nVOICE OVER Some of the old-time sheriffs never even wore a gun. A lot of folks find that hard to believe. Jim Scarborough never carried one. That's the younger Jim. Gaston Boykins wouldn't wear one. Up in Comanche County. \nWe dissolve through more landscapes, bringing us to full day. None of them show people or human habitation. \nVOICE OVER I always liked to hear about the old- timers. Never missed a chance to do so. Nigger Hoskins over in Bastrop County knowed everbody's phone number off by heart. You can't help but compare yourself against the old- timers. Can't help but wonder how they would've operated these times. There was this boy I sent to the gas chamber at Huntsville here a while back. My arrest and my testimony. He killed a fourteen-year-old girl. Papers said it was a crime of passion but he told me there wasn't any passion to it. \nEXT. WEST TEXAS ROAD - DAY \nThe last landscape, hard sunbaked prairie, is surveyed in a long slow pan. \nVOICE OVER Told me that he'd been planning to kill somebody for about as long as he could remember. Said that if they turned him out he'd do it again. \nThe pan has brought into frame the flashing light bars of a police car stopped on the shoulder. A young sheriff's deputy is opening the rear door on the far side of the car. \nVOICE OVER Said he knew he was going to hell. Be there in about fifteen minutes. I don't know what to make of that. I surely don't. \nClose on a pair of hands manacled behind someone's back. A hand enters to take the prisoner by one arm. \nVOICE OVER The crime you see now, it's hard to even take its measure. It's not that I'm afraid of it. \nBack to the shot over the light bars: the deputy, with a hand on top of the prisoner's head to help him clear the door frame, eases the prisoner into the backseat. All we see of the prisoner is his dark hair disappearing into the car. \nVOICE OVER I always knew you had to be willing to die to even do this job -- not to be glorious. But I don't want to push my chips forward and go out and meet something I don't understand. \nThe deputy closes the back door. He opens the front passenger door and reaches down for something-apparently heavy-at his feet. \nVOICE OVER You can say it's my job to fight it but I don't know what it is anymore. \nThe deputy swings the heavy object into the front passenger seat. Matching inside the car: it looks like an oxygen tank with a petcock at the top and tubing running off it. \nVOICE OVER ...More than that, I don't want to know. A man would have to put his soul at hazard. The deputy slams the door. \nOn the door slam we cut to Texas highway racing under the lens, the landscape flat to the horizon. The siren whoops. \nVOICE OVER ...He would have to say, okay, I'll be part of this world. \nINT. SHERIFF LAMAR'S OFFICE - DAY \nTHE DEPUTY Seated in the sheriff's office, on the phone. The prisoner stands in the background. Focus is too soft for us to see his features but his posture shows that his arms are still behind his back. \nDEPUTY Yessir, just walked in the door. Sheriff he had some sort of a thing on him like one of them oxygen tanks for emphysema or somethin'. And a hose from it run down his sleeve... \nA distant range of mountains. No movement. He stoops to examine the trail. \nHe paces it 'til he finds a print clear enough to give him the animal's orientation. He stands and looks again toward the distant mountains. He brings up the binoculars. His point-of-view: landscape, swimming into focus, heat waves exaggerated by the compression of the lens. Panning, looking for the animal. Movement, very distant. The animal is brought into focus: a black tailless dog, huge head, limping badly, phantasmal by virtue of the rippling heat waves and the silence. Moss lowers the glass. A moment of thought as he gazes off. \nHe turns and heads in the direction from which the dog came. \nEXT. RISE NEAR BASIN - MINUTES LATER \nMoss tops a rise. He scans the landscape below. Not much to see except-distant glints, off something not native to the environment. Moss brings up the binoculars. Parked vehicles: three of them, squat, Broncos or other off- road trucks with fat tires, winches in the bed and racks of roof lights. On the ground near the trucks dark shapes lie still. \nEXT. BASIN - MINUTES LATER \nMoss is walking cautiously up to the site, unslung rifle at the ready. Flies drone. He circles two dead bodies lying in the grass, covered with blood. A gut-shot dog of the same kind we saw limping toward the mountains lies beside them. A sawed-off shotgun with a pistol stock lies in the grass. The tires and most of the window glass are shot out of the first pickup Moss approaches. He opens the door and looks inside. \nThe driver is dead, leaning over the wheel. Moss shuts the door. \nHe opens the door of the second truck. The driver, sitting upright, still in shoulder harness, is staring at him. Moss stumbles back, raising the rifle. The man does not move. The front of his shirt is covered with blood. \nMAN Agua. Moss stares at him \nMAN ...Agua. Por Dios. \nMOSS Ain't got no water. On the seat next to the man is an HK machine pistol. Moss looks at it. He looks back at the man. The man is still staring at him. Without lowering his eyes Moss reaches in and takes the pistol. Moss straightens up out of the truck and slings the rifle back over his shoulder. He snaps the clip off the machine pistol, checks it and snaps it back on. Moss crosses to the back of the truck and lifts the tarp that covers the truck bed. A load of brick-sized brown parcels each wrapped in plastic. He throws the tarp back over the load and crosses back to the open cab door. \nMAN Agua. \nMOSS I told you I ain't got no agua. You speak English? A blank look. \nMOSS ...Where's the last guy? \nThe injured man stares, unresponsive. Moss persists: \nMOSS Ultimo hombre. Last man standing, must've been one. Where'd he go? \nMAN ...Agua. Moss turns to scan the horizon. He looks at the tire tracks extending back from the truck. He thinks for a beat. \nMOSS \n(TO HIMSELF) I reckon I'd go out the way I came in... He starts off. \nThrough the truck's open door: \nMAN La puerta... Hay lobos... \nMOSS \n(WALKING OFF) Ain't no lobos. \nEXT. FLATLAND NEAR THE BASIN - LATER \nMoss stops to look out at a new prospect. Flatland, no cover. He raises the binoculars. \nMOSS If you stopped... to watch your backtrack... you're gonna shoot my dumb ass. He doesn't see anything. He lowers the glass, thinking. He raises the glass again. \nMOSS ...But. If you stopped... you stopped in shade. He sets off. \nEXT. NEAR THE ROCK SHELF - DAY \nA POINT-OF-VIEW \nThrough the binoculars, some time later. One lone shelf of rock throws shade toward us. Heat shimmers in between. \nHard sun makes the rock shadow impenetrable. But there is a booted foot sticking into the sun toe-up like the nub on a sundial. Moss lowers the binoculars. He looks at his watch. \nINT. TRAILER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nWe are drifting down toward Moss as he lies in bed next to Carla Jean. He lies still, eyes closed, but he is shaking his head. As the camera stops he opens his eyes, grimacing. \nMOSS All right. \nHe looks at the bedside clock. \nIts LED display: 1:06. He swings his legs off the bed, looks back at Carla Jean, and pulls the blanket up over her shoulder. \nINT. TRAILER KITCHEN - NIGHT \nClose on a gallon jug as Moss hold it under the tap, filling it with water. Carla Jean appears in the doorway, looking sleepy. \nCARLA JEAN Llewelyn. \nMOSS Yeah. \nCARLA JEAN What're you doin', baby? \nMOSS Goin' out. \nCARLA JEAN Goin' where? \nMOSS Somethin' I forgot to do. I'll be back. \nCARLA JEAN What're you goin' to do? Moss turns from the sink, screwing the top onto the jug. \nMOSS I'm fixin' to do somethin' dumbern hell but I'm goin' anyways. He starts toward the front door. \nMOSS ...If I don't come back tell Mother I love her. \nCARLA JEAN Your mother's dead, Llewelyn. \nMOSS Well then I'll tell her myself. \nINT. TRUCK/EXT. CATTLEGUARD ROAD - NIGHT \nA MAP A detailed topographical survey map, illuminated by a flashlight. Moss is studying it in the cab of his truck. After a beat he folds the map. He checks the .45 taken off the corpse with the money. Wider: the pickup truck parked outside the cattle guard. After a beat, the truck drives over the grate onto the unpaved part of the road, jogging up the uneven terrain. Through the windshield, the view is pitch black except for the boulders and scrub picked out by the crazily bouncing headlights. \nEXT. BASIN - NIGHT \nDOOR SLAM We are close on the water jug slapping against Moss's leg as we pull him through the darkness. The shape of his parked truck is just visible behind him, silhouetted on the crest by the glow of the moon already set. Walking across the basin to the near truck Moss freezes, \nNOTICING: Its driver's-side door: closed. Moss scans the horizon. Its only blemish remains his own pickup. He jogs the few remaining paces to the pickup. He sets down the gallon jug. Softly: \nMOSS Hello?... No answer. He opens the door. The man's body is still held upright by the shoulder harness but his head, flayed by buckshot, is tipped away. Moss glances at the bed of the truck. \nEmpty. He again looks at the horizon. \nNow another pickup stands in silhouette next to his own. Two men are there. Moss covers behind the dead man's truck. He eases his head out for another look. Only one man visible now. Sounds hard to identify. Something airy. Up on the crest his pickup rocks and settles. Its tires are being slashed. The other pickup's engine coughs to life. Headlights and roof lights go on. Moss again covers behind the vehicle. \nA search-spot sweeps back and forth across the basin tableau of bodies and trucks. After a few trips back and forth something happens to the spot: its weaving light begins to bounce. We can hear the jouncing suspension of the pickup as it trundles down the incline. But the light tells the perspective of the slowly approaching truck. Moss stays in the lee of his sheltering vehicle as he runs, doubled over, directly away from the light, keeping to the shadow that wipes on and off. A gunshot. Its impact kicks up dirt just ahead of Moss to his right. Moss turns to see: Two jogging men flanking the truck like infantry escorting a tank. One has just halted to fire; the other is now raising his gun. Moss tacks and sprints and rolls under a second abandoned pickup to his left. Another shot sounds and misses. Bullets plunk into the metal of the truck body. One bullet skips off the dirt in front of the truck and pings up into the undercarriage. Moss is elbowing out the far side, next to a body lying by the truck's passenger door. The firing has stopped: Moss steals a look over the hood: The pursuing pickup is slowing so that the two gunmen can swing onto the running boards. \nThe truck accelerates and as it veers around the first abandoned pickup its lights swing off Moss's cover truck. \nMoss sprints off, doubled over, at a perpendicular to his previous path. He hits the ground, pressing himself into the earth, head between his forearms. He elbows away as the truck bears on his former cover. \nEXT. RIVER GORGE - DAWN \nHe tops the small rise and straightens and flat-out runs. We hear the pickup's engine racing and see, behind Moss, its spot sweeping backlight across the crest. Moss is running towards the declivity of a river gorge. Sky there is pink from unrisen sun. Moss bears on the gorge, panting. \nThe pickup bounces up into view on the crest behind him, roof lights blazing. It is pointed off at an angle. Its spotlight sweeps the river plain. It finds Moss. The truck reorients as it bounces down in pursuit. A muzzle flash precedes the dull whump of the shotgun. Moss races on toward the river. Another shotgun whump. Moss stumbles, turns to look behind him. The truck, gaining ground. A man stands up out of the sunroof, one hand on top of the cab, the other holding a shotgun. Moss is almost to the steep riverbank. Another whump of the shotgun. Shot catches Moss on the right shoulder. It tears the back of his shirt away and sends him over the crest of the river bank. Moss airborne, ass over elbows, hits near the bottom of the sandy slope with a loud fhump. He rolls to a stop and looks up. We hear a skidding squeal and see dirt and dust float over the lip of the ridge, thrown by the truck's hard stop. As Moss pulls off his boots we hear voices from the men in the truck. There is the clank of its tailgate being dropped and sounds of activity on the hollow metal of its bed. \nPROPRIETOR Well... I need to see about closin'. \nCHIGURH See about closing. \nPROPRIETOR Yessir. \nCHIGURH What time do you close? \nPROPRIETOR Now. We close now. \nCHIGURH Now is not a time. What time do you close. \nPROPRIETOR Generally around dark. At dark. Chigurh stares, slowly chewing. \nCHIGURH You don't know what you're talking about, do you? \nPROPRIETOR Sir? \nCHIGURH I said you don't know what you're talking about. Chigurh chews. \nCHIGURH ...What time do you go to bed. \nPROPRIETOR Sir? \nCHIGURH You're a bit deaf, aren't you? I said what time do you go to bed. \nPROPRIETOR Well... A pause. \nPROPRIETOR ...I'd say around nine-thirty. Somewhere around nine-thirty. \nCHIGURH I could come back then. \nPROPRIETOR Why would you be comin' back? We'll be closed. \nCHIGURH You said that. He continues to stare, chewing. \nPROPRIETOR Well... I need to close now -- \nCHIGURH You live in that house behind the store? \nPROPRIETOR Yes I do. \nCHIGURH You've lived here all your life? A beat. \nPROPRIETOR This was my wife's father's place. Originally. \nCHIGURH You married into it. \nPROPRIETOR We lived in Temple Texas for many years. Raised a family there. In Temple. We come out here about four years ago. \nCHIGURH You married into it. \nPROPRIETOR ...If that's the way you wanna put it. \nCHIGURH I don't have some way to put it. That's the way it is. \nHe finishes the cashews and wads the packet and sets it on the counter where it begins to slowly unkink. The proprietor's eyes have tracked the packet. Chigurh's eyes stay on the proprietor. \nCHIGURH ...What's the most you've ever lost on a coin toss? \nPROPRIETOR Sir? \nCHIGURH The most. You ever lost. On a coin toss. \nCARLA JEAN So... for how long do we have to... \nMOSS Baby, at what point would you quit botherin' to look for your two million dollars? \nCarla Jean stares, thinking. \nCARLA JEAN What'm I supposed to tell Mama? \nMOSS Try standin' in the door and hollerin: Mama I'm home. \nCARLA JEAN \nLLEWELYN -- \nMOSS C'mon, pack your things. Anything you leave you ain't gonna see again. Carla Jean begins peevishly tossing things into a bag: \nCARLA JEAN Well thanks for fallin' all over and apologizing. \nMOSS Things happened. I can't take 'em back. \nEXT. CATTLEGUARD ROAD - NIGHT \nPOINT-OF-VIEW THROUGH WINDSHIELD It is night. No other vehicles on this paved road. Our car turns off and rattles over a cattleguard. Parked on the other side is a Ramcharger. Its passenger door starts to open. Outside: Chigurh emerges from his Ford. The man emerging from the truck wears a Western-cut suit. \nMAN Mind ridin' bitch? \nEXT. BASIN - NIGHT \nTHE RAMCHARGER Bouncing through ungraded terrain. It stops and discharges the three men-the driver and his partner, both in suits, from either side, and then Chigurh from the middle seat. \nThey have pulled over at Moss's truck. \nCHIGURH This his truck? He is opening the door and looking at the plate riveted inside. \nMAN Mm-hm. \nCHIGURH Screwgie. The man reaches into a pocket and hands over a screwdriver. As Chigurh works it under the plate: \nCHIGURH ...Who slashed his tires? \nDRIVER Wudden us. \nEXT. BASIN - NIGHT \nA flashlight beam picks out the dog carcass. \nDRIVER That's a dead dog. \nCHIGURH Thank you. Chigurh plays the flashlight around the scene. Dead bodies on the ground. \nCHIGURH ...Where's the transponder? \nMAN In the truck. I'll get it. \nDRIVER These are some ripe petunias. Chigurh gives his flashlight to the driver. \nCHIGURH Hold this please. He bends down and takes a 9 mm. Glock off of one of the dead bodies and checks the clip. The other man is returning from the truck. He hands Chigurh a small electronic receiver. \nCHIGURH ...You getting anything on this? \nMAN Not a bleep. \nCHIGURH All right... Chigurh stands and holds his hand out for his flashlight. The driver hands it to him. Chigurh shines it in his face and shoots him through the forehead. As the man falls Chigurh pans the light to the other man who has watched his partner drop. He looks up, puzzled, and is shot as well. \nBELL It's the same tire tread comin back as goin'. Made about the same time. You can see the sipes real clear. Wendell is standing in the stirrups, looking up the ridge. \nWENDELL Truck's just yonder. Somebodies pried the inspection plate off the door. Bell looks up, circling the truck. \nBELL I know this truck. Belongs to a feller named Moss. \nWENDELL Llewelyn Moss? \nBELL That's the boy. \nWENDELL You figure him for a dope runner? Bell sits his horse looking at the slashed tires. \nBELL I don't know but I kindly doubt it. \nBASIN - DAY \nBY THE BODIES The two lawmen are dismounting. \nWENDELL Hell's bells, they even shot the dog. They walk towards the near truck. \nWENDELL ...Well this is just a deal gone wrong. Sheriff Bell stoops to look at casings. \nBELL Yes, appears to have been a glitch or two. \nWENDELL What calibers you got there, Sheriff? \nBELL Nine millimeter. Couple of .45 ACP's. He stands, looking at the truck. \nBELL ...Somebody unloaded on this thing with a shotgun. \nWENDELL Mm. Bell opens the door of the truck. Looks at the dead driver. \nWENDELL ...How come do you reckon the coyotes ain't been at 'em? \nBELL I don't know... He shuts the door softly with two hands. \nBELL ...Supposedly they won't eat a Mexican. Wendell is looking at the two corpses close together, wearing suits. \nWENDELL These boys appear to be managerial. Bell walks back toward the bed of the truck as Wendell \nAPPRAISES: \nWENDELL ...I think we're lookin' at more'n one fracas. A gesture toward the scattered bodies. \nWENDELL ...Wild West over there... A nod down at the two men in suits with head wounds. \nWENDELL ...Execution here. Bell, at the back of the truck, wets a finger and runs it against the bed and looks at it. \nBELL That Mexican brown dope. Wendell strolls among the bodies. \nWENDELL These boys is all swole up. So this was earlier: gettin set to trade. Then, whoa, differences... You know: might not of even been no money. \nBELL That's possible. \nWENDELL But you don't believe it. \nBELL No. Probably I don't. \nWENDELL It's a mess, ain't it Sheriff? Bell is remounting. \nBELL If it ain't it'll do til a mess gets here. \nEXT. MOSS' TRAILER - DAY \nCARLA JEAN Llewelyn? \nMOSS Yes ma'am? \nCARLA JEAN You are comin back, ain't ya? \nMOSS I shall return. \nEXT. MOSS'S TRAILER - DAY \nWendell is knocking at its door. Sheriff Bell stands one step behind him. \nWENDELL Sheriff's Department! No answer. \nBELL Look at the lock. They both look. A beat. \nWENDELL We goin' in? \nBELL Gun out and up. Wendell unholsters his gun but hesitates. \nWENDELL What about yours? \nBELL I'm hidin' behind you. Wendell eases the door open. \nWENDELL Sheriff's Department! \nINT. MOSS' TRAILER - DAY \nThe men cautiously enter, Wendell leading. \nWENDELL ...Nobody here. He lowers his gun and starts to holster it. \nBELL No reason not to stay safe. Wendell keeps the gun out. \nWENDELL No sir. He goes to the bedroom door as Sheriff Bell, seeing the lock cylinder on the floor, stoops and hefts it. He looks up at the wall opposite the door: the small dent. \nWendell pulls his head out of the bedroom. \nWENDELL ...I believe they've done lit a shuck. \nBELL Believe you're right. \nWENDELL That from the lock? Sheriff Bell stands and wanders, looking around. \nBELL Probably must be. \nWENDELL So when was he here? \nBELL I don't know. Oh. He is at the counter staring at something. \nBELL ...Now that's aggravating. \nWENDELL Sheriff? Sheriff Bell points at the carton of milk. \nBELL Still sweating. Wendell is agitated. \nWENDELL Whoa! Sheriff! Sheriff Bell unhurriedly opens a cabinet. He looks closes it, opens another. \nWENDELL ...Sheriff, we just missed him! We gotta circulate this! On the radio! Sheriff Bell takes a glass from the cabinet. \nBELL Well, okay... He pours milk into the glass. \nBELL ...What do we circulate? He sits on the sofa and takes a sip from the milk. \nWOMAN Hello? \nCHIGURH Is Llewelyn there? \nWOMAN Llewelyn?! No he ain't. \nCHIGURH You expect him? The woman's voice is old, querulous: \nWOMAN Now why would I expect him? Who is this? Chigurh stares for a short beat, then prongs the phone. \nINT. A SMALL GENERAL STORE - DAY \nMoss is standing in front of a rack of cowboy boots at the back of the store. He looks up at an approaching salesman, a bow-legged old man in a white shirt. \nSALESMAN Hep you? \nMOSS I need the Larry Mahan's in black, size 11. \nSALESMAN Okay. \nMOSS You sell socks? \nSALESMAN Just white. He gathers up a brown paper bag from a pharmacy. \nMOSS White is all I wear. You got a bathroom? \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nMoss is sitting on the toilet taking off socks with bloody soles. Sneakers sit on the floor. The pharmacy bag sits next to them. He sprays disinfectant on his feet. He takes out bandages. \nINT. SHOE STORE - DAY \nMoss is returning. The bowlegged salesman stands in the aisle holding aloft a pair of boots. \nSALESMAN Ain't got Larries in black but I got 'em in osta-rich. Break in easy. \nINT. CAB/EXT. DEL RIO MOTEL - NIGHT \nIt is rolling to a stop in front of Charlie Goodnight's Del Rio Motor Hotel. Moss fishes for his wallet but stops, looking. Parked in the street in front of the motel is an offroad truck with roof lights. \nMOSS Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms. \nDRIVER What room? \nMOSS Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here. The cab rolls slowly up the lot. \nMOSS ...Keep going. His pivoting point-of-view of his room. The window shows a part between the curtains. \nMOSS ...Keep going. Don't stop. \nDRIVER I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy. \nMOSS It's all right. \nDRIVER Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it. \nMOSS I want you to take me to another motel. \nDRIVER Let's just call it square. Moss reaches a hundred-dollar bill up to the driver. \nMOSS You're already in a jackpot. I'm trying to get you out of it. Now take me to a motel. The driver reaches up for the bill then turns the cab out of the parking lot onto the hiway. Moss turns to look at the receding lights of the motel. \nEXT. THROUGHWAY INTERCHANGE - NIGHT \nMOSS You have camping supplies? \nANOTHER COUNTER A clerk stares at Moss. \nCLERK Tent poles. \nMOSS Uh-huh. \nCLERK You already have the tent? \nMOSS Somethin' like that. \nCLERK Well you give me the model number of the tent I can order you the poles. \nMOSS Never mind. I want a tent. \nCLERK What kind of tent? \nMOSS The kind with the most poles. \nCLERK Well I guess that'd be our ten-foot backyard Per-Gola. You can stand up in it. Well, some people could stand up in it. Six foot clearance at the ridge. You might just could. \nMOSS Let me have that one. Where's the nearest hardware store? \nINT. MOSS' NEW MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nHe has the shotgun wedged in an open drawer and is sawing off its barrel with a hacksaw. \nMINUTES LATER \nMoss sits on the bed dressing the barrel with a file. He puts down the file, looks at the barrel. He slides the forearm back and forward again and lets the hammer down with his thumb. He looks the gun over, appraising, and then opens the box of shells and starts feeding in the heavy waxed loads. \nINT. FIRST MOTEL LOBBY - DAY \nMoss enters carrying a new duffle bag. The same woman is behind the counter. \nMOSS Could I get another room. \nWOMAN You want to change rooms? \nMOSS No, I want to keep my room, and get another one. \nWOMAN Another additional. \nMOSS Uh-huh.You got a map of the rooms? She inclines her head to look under the counter. \nWOMAN Yeah we had a sorta one. \nShe finds a brochure and hands it across. It shows a car from the fifties parked in front of the hotel in hard sunlight. \nMoss unfolds the brochure and studies. \nMOSS What about one forty-two. \nWOMAN You can have the one next to yours if you want. One twenty. It ain't took. \nMOSS No, one forty-two. \nWOMAN That's got two double beds. \nEXT. MOTEL PARKING LOT - DAY \nAn arcing point of view on the window of Moss's old room. The curtain still slightly open. A reverse shows Moss crossing the lot from the office carrying his long nylon duffle bag, studying the room. He looks further down the street. The truck with the roof lights is still parked there. \nCHIGURH He stands at the door of Moss's first room. He eases an ear against it. He steps back. He punches out the lock cylinder with the airgun and kicks in the door, raising the shotgun. A Mexican in a guyabera reclines on one of the two double beds. He is scrabbling for a machine pistol on the nightstand. Chigurh fires three times quickly. The damped blasts have the low resonance of chugs into a bottle. \nMOSS \nHead still in the airduct, frozen, listening. \nEXT./INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nCHIGURH Also frozen, back against the wall outside the room, to one side of the open door. After a beat he steps back into the open doorway leveling the gun. Inside the room: no movement. Much of the man on the bed is spattered against the chewed-up headboard. The bathroom door is ajar, its light on. A long beat. \nMovement in the wedge of light. Immediately, chugs from the shotgun chew up bathroom door and nearby wallboard. A cry from inside. A brief chatter of machine pistol. \nINT. MOTEL DUCT - NIGHT \nMOSS'S POV Along the air vent. The machine-pistol chatter crosses the cut. We hear bullets snap through metal. The sound brings on indirect light as holes are punched in the duct somewhere around the bend. Moss holds still as the galvanized metal faintly thunders. The flashlight resting on it wobbles. \nEXT./INT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nCHIGURH Gun leveled, at the open door. Again, no movement. He advances into the room, gun pointing at the bathroom door. As he advances he swings the gun briefly over at the closet door and fires. The splintered-in door reveals no occupant. \nChigurh angles around the double bed to get a view of that wedge of bathroom floor visible through its door. Blood is pooling out from the right. \nChigurh fires at the baseboard to the right of the door. \nINT. MOTEL DUCT - NIGHT \nMoss makes another attempt to hook the bag. The hook takes. Moss drags the case inches out into the duct's bend before the hook slides off again. \nINT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM BATHROOM - NIGHT \nCHIGURH He uses the shotgun barrel to push open what's left of the bathroom door. \nThe mirror over the facing sink gives a view of most of the hidden side of the bedroom/ bathroom party wall. Partial view of a man pressed against the wall, standing in the tub in the corner. From his posture and the one visible hand he seems unarmed. Chigurh enters the bathroom. The cornered man is unhurt but terrified. He holds up his hands. \nMAN No me mate. The man on the floor is quite dead. A machine pistol lies in one out-flung hand. Chigurh looks back up at the survivor. \nCHIGURH How'd you find it? \nMAN No me mate. Chigurh walks unhurriedly to the tub. The man watches him, hands up, vibrating. Chigurh reaches with his free hand and pulls the shower curtain most of the way round, hiding the man. He angles the nose of the shotgun in and fires. \nMOSS \nThe hook again snags a strap on the case. Moss pulls, carefully. \nINT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - MAIN ROOM - NIGHT \nChigurh emerges from the bathroom. His socks are sodden with gore. He sits on the bed and peels them off. He rubs the bottom of each foot with the ankle of each sock and drops the socks to the floor. He rises and opens three bureau drawers, which are empty, and leaves them open. He pulls open what remains of the closet door. Empty. He looks under the bed. He stands, looks around. He looks up. His look lingers. \nClose on the airduct grille: it is dusty. Rub-marks have made four dark bands across the dusty slats. Chigurh's fingers rise into frame and meet the grille, roughly aligning with the finger marks in the dust. Close on a screwhead: a dime enters and engages the screw and starts turning it. \nINT. MOTEL DUCT - NIGHT \nFrom inside the duct: fingers reach through the grille and Chigurh's hand pushes it up into the duct, then angles it and withdraws it. Faintly, under the distant airy drone of the compressor, we hear the grate clatter to the floor. The back of Chigurh's head appears. He aims a flashlight away down the far length of the duct. A beat. He pivots to face us. His point-of-view: the length of the duct, empty, with a drag-mark through the middle of the dust. Back to Chigurh. His look holds. He ducks out. \nINT. 1ST MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nIn the room: Chigurh steps down from the chair and pulls the receiver from his pocket and turns it on. It beeps once. \nSilence. \nFrowning, looking down at the receiver, Chigurh makes a slow sweep with it. The silence holds-snapped off by car steady as we cut to: \nINT. STATION WAGON - NIGHT \nMOSS Yeah. \nYOUTH Okay, lemme have the money. \nMOSS It's right here. Give me the coat. \nYOUTH Lemme hold the money. Moss does. \nMOSS Gimme the clothes. The youth starts to peel them. \nMOSS ...And let me have your beer. \nYOUTH ...How much? \nSECOND YOUTH Brian. Give him the beer. \nMINUTES LATER The boys are receding. Moss pours the beer over his head, rubbing blood away. He opens his shirt. He inspects the wounds in his midriff, entrance and exit. Pulsing blood laps weakly out. He shrugs off his shirt, wraps it around his waist and knots it. He starts to put on the new shirt. Something stops him. He pauses. He vomits into the roadbed. \nHe straightens slowly and puts on the new shirt. He looks out. \nHe is not yet over the river: wind stirs the cane on the bank. He looks up: Chain-link fence encloses the walkway to a height of about twelve feet, curling inward at the top. He looks down the walkway. The three boys are distant figures. He looks up the walkway. A few paces up a light pole stanchion stands flush to the guardrail that separates road and walkway. He goes to the stanchion and uses it to hoist himself onto the guardrail, his free hand holding the case. \nStanding on top of the curved metal rail and holding the post for balance, he kneebends down and up and heaves the case. It sails clear of the chain-link fence. A short beat and we hear a thump. Moss pants for a moment, recovering from the strain of the toss. He eases himself off the guardrail and goes to the fence and looks at the bank below. One gnarled tree stands out in the cane. The case, wherever it landed, is not visible. \nEXT. GUARDSHACK MEXICAN SIDE - NIGHT \nThere is a lighted guardshack at the end of the walkway. Inside, a uniformed guard. Moss walks unsteadily up. He tilts the beer bottle in salute at the guard. The guard impassively lets him proceed. \nEXT. MEXICAN SQUARE - DAWN \nBLACK In black, an insanely cheerful mariachi song. Fade in on the mariachis. We are looking steeply up at them, dutch-angled. They beam down at us, energetically thumping their oversized guitars and bajo sextos. We boom woozily up and start to un-dutch. \nReverse on Moss struggling to a sitting position on the park bench where he'd been lying. A public square. \nBack to the mariachis. Beaming, singing. Their smiles gradually fade. The playing falls off to silence. In the silence, birds chirp. The musicians are looking quizzically down. Moss's arm swings up in the foreground, extending a bloody hundred-dollar bill. On Moss. His coat has swung open to expose his bloody midriff. His look up is glazed. \nMOSS Doctor. \nThe mariachis stare. Moss waggles the bill. \nMOSS ...Medico. Por favor. \nINT. RAMCHARGER/EXT. WAL-MART - DAY \nWe are close on a patch of its front seat. Day. The pickup is parked. The piece of upholstery we are looking at has blood soaked into it. On the sound of the door opening we cut wider. We are in the parking lot of a Wal-Mart. Chigurh, climbing in, tosses a brown paper bag onto the passenger side. He has a dark towel wrapped around one leg. As he slides behind the wheel the wrapped part of his leg slides over the bloodstain. \nINT. RAMCHARGER/EXT. PHARMACY - DAY \nTRAVELING POINT OF VIEW A small-town main street. We are driving past a pharmacy. Chigurh, looking. He parks. He takes a scissors from the Wal-Mart bag and a box of cotton. He opens the box and cuts a little disc out of the cardboard. He takes a new shirt out of the bag and begins to cut through one sleeve. \nEXT. PHARMACY - DAY \nSHOOTING PAST A PARKED CAR Chigurh limps toward us. He holds a coat hanger bent straight with the balled-up shirtsleeve hooked at one end. Chigurh arrives, looks up and down the street. He unscrews the gas cap, feeds the coat hanger in to soak the shirt, pulls it back out. He tapes the cardboard disc over the open gas tank. He unhooks the wet shirtsleeve and jams it up over the disk. He lights it and exits. \nINSIDE THE PHARMACY - DAY A beat pulling Chigurh limping up the aisle, and then the car explodes out front. The plate glass storefront blows in. The few people inside rush out; Chigurh doesn't react. The pharmacy counter in back is deserted. Chigurh lifts a hinged piece of counter to enter and starts looking through the stock. He pulls out a packet of syringes, Hydrocodone tablets, penicillin. \nINT. SMALL TOWN MOTEL ROOM - DAY \nChigurh dumps the pharmaceuticals into the bathroom sink. In the room outside he sits on the bed and takes off his boots. He unknots the towel from around his leg and stands and unbuttons his pants and starts cutting from the crotch down with a heavy scissors. One thigh is a mess of clotted blood and torn fabric. \nINT. MOTEL BATHROOM - DAY \nBATH Chigurh lowers himself into bath water that quickly turns pink. He laves water over his bloody thigh. There is a dark red hole, one half inch across, pulsing blood into the bath water Torn pieces of fabric from his pants are embedded in the bleeding skin. \nDRIVER Oh. One of the tiedowns worked lose. Bell whips the tarp back to expose eight corpses wrapped blue sheeting bound with tape. \nBELL How many did you leave with? The driver is still smiling. \nDRIVER I ain't lost none of 'em, Sheriff. \nBELL Couldn't you all of took a van out there? \nDRIVER Didn't have no van with four-wheel drive. Sheriff Bell pulls the tarp down and ties it. The driver watches without helping. \nDRIVER ...You going to write me up for improperly secured load? Sheriff Bell cinches the knot tight. \nBELL You get your ass out of here. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nMoss, in bed, stirs at an off screen voice: \nVOICE I'm guessin'... this is not the future you pictured for yourself when you first clapped eyes on that money. Moss blearily focuses on: A fancy crocodile boot. His look rises from the boot, crossed on his visitor's knee, up to the man's face. Carson Wells smiles at him from the bedside chair. \nWELLS ...Don't worry. I'm not the man that's after you. \nMOSS I know, I've seen him. Sort of. Wells is surprised. \nWELLS You've seen him. And you're not dead. He nods, impressed. \nWELLS ...But that won't last. \nMOSS What is he supposed to be, the ultimate bad-ass? \nWELLS I don't think that's how I would describe him. \nMOSS How would you describe him? \nWELLS I guess I'd say... that he doesn't have a sense of humor. His name is Chigurh. \nMOSS Sugar? \nWELLS Chigurh. Anton Chigurh. You know how he found you? \nMOSS I know how he found me. \nWELLS It's called a transponder. \nMOSS I know what it is. He won't find me again. \nWELLS Not that way. \nMOSS Not any way. \nWELLS Took me about three hours. \nMOSS I been immobile. \nWELLS No. You don't understand. Wells sits back and studies Moss. \nWELLS ...What do you do? \nMOSS I'm retired. \nWELLS What did you do? \nMOSS I'm a welder. \nCARLA JEAN No I ain't. \nBELL Nothin'? \nCARLA JEAN Not word one. \nBELL Would you tell me if you had? \nCARLA JEAN Well, I don't know. He don't need any trouble from you. \nBELL It's not me he's in trouble with. \nCARLA JEAN Who's he in trouble with then? \nBELL Some pretty bad people. \nCARLA JEAN Llewelyn can take care of hisself. \nBELL These people will kill him, Carla Jean. They won't quit. \nCARLA JEAN He won't neither. He never has. \nBELL I wish I could say that was in his favor. But I have to say I don't think it is. \nCARLA JEAN He can take all comers. Bell looks at her. After a beat: \nBELL You know Charlie Walser? Has the place east of Sanderson? She shakes her head, shrugs. \nBELL ...Well you know how they used to slaughter beeves, hit 'em with a maul right here to stun 'em... Indicates between his own eyes. \nBELL ...and then truss 'em up and slit their throats? Well here Charlie has one trussed up and all set to drain him and the beef comes to. It starts thrashing around, six hundred pounds of very pissed-off livestock if you'll pardon my... Charlie grabs his gun there to shoot the damn thing in the head but what with the swingin' and twistin' it's a glance-shot and ricochets around and comes back hits Charlie in the shoulder. You go see Charlie, he still can't reach up with his right hand for his hat... Point bein', even in the contest between man and cow the issue is not certain. He takes a sip of coffee, leaving room for Carla Jean to argue if inclined. She does not. Sheriff Bell hands a card across. \nBELL ...When Llewelyn calls, just tell him I can make him safe. She takes the card. Sheriff Bell sips. \nBELL ...Course, they slaughter beeves different now. Use a air gun. Shoots out a rod, about this far into the brain... He holds thumb and forefinger a couple inches apart. \nBELL ...Sucks back in. Animal never knows what hit him. Another beat. Carla Jean stares at him. \nCARLA JEAN Why you tellin' me that, Sheriff? \nBELL I don't know. My mind wanders. \nEXT. RIO GRANDE BRIDGE - AFTERNOON \nLate Day. Carson Wells grabs a light pole stanchion to hoist himself onto the guardrail. He stands atop it, eyeing the chain-link fence across the walkway. He climbs down and crosses to the fence and looks down: The brown, sluggish water of the Rio Grande. \nLOOKING DOWN THE WALKWAY Carson Wells enters frame and recedes down the walkway. When he draws even with the next stanchion he looks down through the fence: \nCane on the riverbank, and one gnarled tree. \nINT. HOTEL EAGLE LOBBY - NIGHT \nTwilight. Carson Wells enters the hotel and crosses the lobby. \nINT. STAIRWAY - NIGHT \nCarson Wells appears around the corner and we pull him as he mounts the stairs. When he is about halfway up a figure -- focus does not hold him -- rounds the corner behind and silently follows, holding a fat-barreled shotgun loosely at his side. After a few steps Carson Wells stops, frowning, cued by we don't know what. Focus drops back as he turns. Chigurh raises the shotgun. \nCHIGURH Hello Carson. Let's go to your room. \n2ND HOTEL EAGLE ROOM - NIGHT Chigurh sits into a chair drawn up to face the armchair where Carson Wells sits. \nWELLS We don't have to do this. I'm a daytrader. I could just go home. \nCHIGURH ...I know where you are. \nMOSS Yeah? Where am I? \nCHIGURH You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going? \nMOSS Yeah. I know where you're going. \nCHIGURH All right. \nMOSS You know she won't be there. \nCHIGURH It doesn't make any difference where she is. \nMOSS So what're you goin' up there for. A beat. \nCHIGURH You know how this is going to turn out, don't you? \nMOSS No. Do you? \nCHIGURH Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't. \nMOSS Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all. Moss slams the phone onto its hook, then slams it twice more for good measure. Chigurh, in the hotel room, cradles his phone. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nSheriff Bell sits at his usual booth, but with an unaccustomed look: reading glasses. He has been looking at a newspaper but is now peering over his glasses up at Wendell who apparently interrupted his reading. \nBELL The motel in Del Rio? Wendell nods. \nWENDELL Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans. \nBELL There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when. \nWENDELL Yessir. \nBELL Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock? \nWENDELL Yessir. It was punched out. \nBELL Okay. \nWENDELL You gonna drive out there? \nBELL No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes. \nWENDELL How's that, Sheriff? \nBELL Natural to the line of work they was in. \nWENDELL Yessir. \nBELL My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know... He rattles the paper. \nBELL ...Here last week they found this couple out in California they would rent out rooms to old people and then kill em and bury em in the yard and cash their social security checks. They'd torture em first, I don't know why. Maybe their television set was broke. And this went on until, and here I quote... He looks through his glasses at the paper. \nBELL ...\"Neighbors were alerted when a man ran from the premises wearing only a dog collar.\" You can't make up such a thing as that. I dare you to even try. He peers over his glasses at Wendell who respectfully shakes his head and tsks. Sheriff Bell rattles the paper again. \nBELL ...But that's what it took, you'll notice. Get someone's attention. Diggin graves in the back yard didn't bring any. Wendell bites back a smile. Sheriff Bell gazes at him over his glasses for a long beat, deadpan. \nBELL ...That's all right. I laugh myself sometimes. He goes back to the paper. \nBELL ...There ain't a whole lot else you can do. \nCLERK No sir, it's unusual. \nEXT. RIVER BANK - DAY \nWe are looking across the Rio Grande. Moss appears over the near edge of the river bank, newly clothed, and holding the document case. As he reaches the top of the bank he frowns and twists his neck, responding to an irritation. He feels around with his free hand inside the back of the shirt collar. A sharp yank. His hand comes away with a small tag. \nINT. GREYHOUND STATION - DEL RIO - DAY \nThe document case is resting on a small foreground counter. Moss is at a pay phone, one hand holding the phone to his ear, the other resting on the case. The voice on the phone is old, female, and querulous: \nVOICE She don't want to talk to you. \nMOSS Yes she does. Put her on. \nVOICE Do you know what time it is? \nMOSS I don't care what time it is. Don't you hang up this phone. \nVOICE I told her what was going to happen, didn't I. Chapter and verse. I said: This is what will come to pass. And now it has come to pass -- Scuffing sounds, a sharp \"Mama!\", and then, into the phone: \nCARLA JEAN Llewelyn? \nMOSS Hey. \nCARLA JEAN What should I do? \nMOSS You know what's goin' on? \nCARLA JEAN I don't know, I had the sheriff here from Terrell County -- \nMOSS What did you tell him? \nCARLA JEAN What did I know to tell him. You're hurt, ain't you? \nMOSS What makes you say that? \nCARLA JEAN I can hear it in your voice. \nMOTHER \n(DISTANT) There is falseness in his voice! \nMOSS Meet me at the Heart of Texas motel in El Paso. I'm gonna give you the money and put you on a plane. \nCARLA JEAN Llewelyn, I ain't gonna leave you in the lurch. \nMOSS No. This works better. With you gone and I don't have the money, he can't touch me. But I can sure touch him. After I find him I'll come and join you. \nCARLA JEAN Find who? What am I supposed to do with Mother? \nMOSS She'll be all right. \nCARLA JEAN She'll be all right? \nMOTHER \n(DISTANT) Be all right! I've got the cancer! \nMOSS I don't think anybody'll bother her. \nOFFICE HALLWAY - DAY \nA LOCK CYLINDER It blows in. The hole shows a brightly lit cinderblock wall behind. The door swings open and the air tank is swung in and deposited on carpet. Wider: Chigurh enters the carpeted hallway from the cinderblock stairwell, holding the tricked-out shotgun. The hallway is white wallboard, doors opening off it at long intervals. Chigurh stands still and listens. Nothing but the hum of ventilation. \nAs Carla Jean goes to the station a man emerges from a car pulled up behind. He is a well-dressed Mexican of early middle age. \nMEXICAN Do you need help with the bags, madam? \nMOTHER Well thank god there's one gentleman left in West Texas. Yes thank you. I am old and I am not well. \nMEXICAN Which bus are you taking? \nMOTHER We're going to El Paso, don't ask me why. Discombobulated by a no-account son-in-law. Thank you. You don't often see a Mexican in a suit. \nMEXICAN You go to El Paso? I know it. Where are you staying? \nINT. BUS STATION - DAY \nCarla Jean is at a phone booth. After a short wait, a pickup and a filtered: \nSHERIFF BELL Carla Jean, how are you. \nCARLA JEAN Sheriff, was that a true story about Charlie Walser? \nBELL Who's Charlie Walser. Oh! Well, I, uh... True story? I couldn't swear to ever detail but... it's certainly true that it is a story. \nCARLA JEAN Yeah, right. Sheriff, can you give me your word on somethin'? \nSHERIFF BELL'S OFFICE - DAY We intercut Sheriff Bell in his office. \nBELL Yes ma'am? \nCARLA JEAN If I tell you where Llewelyn's headed, you promise it'll be just you goes and talks with him -- you and nobody else? \nBELL Yes ma'am, I do. \nCARLA JEAN Llewelyn would never ask for help. He never thinks he needs any. \nBELL Carla Jean, I will not harm your man. And he needs help, whether he knows it or not. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nCHIGURH A driving point-of-view approaching Chigurh, who leans against his Ramcharger, its hood up, stopped on the shoulder on the opposite side of the road. Reverse shows a man in an El Camino. Chickens in stacked cages squawk and flutter in the bed. The man slows and rolls his window down to lean out. \nMAN What's the problem there, neighbor. \nMINUTES LATER The man has pulled his vehicle over nose-to-nose with Chigurh's. He is rummaging in the car behind the seat. His voice comes out muffled: \nMAN Yeah, that'll suck some power. Over time. \nCHIGURH You from around here? The man emerges with jumper cables. \nMAN Alpine. Born 'n bred. Here ya go. He hands one pair of leads to Chigurh. \nCHIGURH What airport would you use. \nMAN Huh? Airport or airstrip? \nCHIGURH Airport. \nMAN Well -- where ya goin'? \nCHIGURH I don't know. \nMAN Just lightin' out for the territories, huh. Brother, I been there... Well... He takes off his hat and draws a sleeve across his brow, thinking. \nMAN ...There's airstrips. He turns with his pair of leads to clamp them onto his battery. On his back: \nSheriff Bell jogs toward the crawling man, one hand on his holstered gun. Behind the man on the veranda is his abandoned machine pistol. He is a Mexican in a guyabera. Sheriff Bell yells at a scared face in a cracked door: \nBELL Call police. He is still jogging. A glance to the side: Rough point-of-view of a woman's body, belly-down at the lip of the pool, head and upper torso in the water. Rough point-of-view forward: an open room door. Booted feet stick out. Sheriff Bell arrives. Moss is face-up, mostly inside the room. The new gun bag is next to him. The gun is in hand. He is still. Voices. Sheriff Bell glances off. \nBELL ...Call your local law enforcement. I'm not on their radio. \nEXT. MOTEL - NIGHT \nNight. The entrance is blocked by police vehicles. \nPeople stand around in knots. Sheriff Bell is talking to the local sheriff. A door slam attracts his look. \nCarla Jean has gotten out of the far side of a cab. On the near side the driver is leaning in to help her mother out. After a couple of rocking attempts she has enough inertia to come to her feet outside the vehicle. Carla Jean is advancing slowly toward Sheriff Bell, taking in the scene. Sheriff Bell steps toward her. Her eyes track his hand as he raises it to his hat. He takes it off. \nBELL Carla Jean... \nCARLA JEAN No. \nINT. HOSPITAL/MORGUE - NIGHT \nLooking down a long corridor flanked by a wall of stainless steel drawers. At the far end stands Bell, hat in hand, staring down into an open drawer just in front of him. A long beat. \nEXT. HOSPITAL / MORGUE - NIGHT \nThe local sheriff, Roscoe Giddins, stands smoking under the port cochere in front of the hospital. Sheriff Bell emerges from the building. A long beat. \nBELL I don't know who she is. He puts his hat back on. \nROSCOE I thought maybe she was with your boy there. \nBELL No ID in her room? \nROSCOE Not hardly nothin' in her room. And that establishment was no stickler on registration. Well... \nThe two men start walking. \nROSCOE ...County'll bury her. Here Lies Female, Unknown. Her Number Was Up. A walking beat. \nROSCOE ...Buy you a cup of coffee before you drive home? \nCOFFEE SHOP - EL PASO - NIGHT Roscoe and Sheriff Bell face each other over coffee. \nBELL No money in his room there? \nROSCOE Couple hundred on his person. Those hombres would've taken the stash. \nBELL I suppose. Though they was leavin' in a hurry. \nROSCOE It's all the goddamned money, Ed Tom. The money and the drugs. It's just goddamned beyond everything. What is it mean? What is it leading to? \nBELL Yes. \nROSCOE If you'd a told me twenty years ago I'd see children walkin' the streets of our Texas towns with green hair and bones in their noses I just flat out wouldn't of believed you. \nBELL Signs and wonders. But I think once you stop hearin' sir and madam the rest is soon to follow. \nROSCOE It's the tide. It's the dismal tide. It is not the one thing. \nBELL Not the one thing. I used to think I could at least some way put things right. I don't feel that way no more. A beat. \nBELL ...I don't know what I do feel like. \nROSCOE Try \"old\" on for size. \n", "test1_input": "MAN Yes? \nWELLS Can I get my parking ticket validated? \nThe man gazes. \nMAN ...An attempt at humor, I suppose. \nWELLS I'm sorry. \nMAN Goodbye, Mr. Wells. \nEXT. EAGLE PASS TOWN SQUARE - DUSK \nMoss is getting out of the station wagon with his duffle and document case. \nIt is a town square. Among the old buildings is the Hotel Eagle, identified by a neon above the front door. \nINT. HOTEL EAGLE LOBBY - NIGHT \nMoss enters. Behind the front desk an older man sits reading Ring magazine. He has a hand-rolled cigarette. \nMOSS One room, one night. \nCLERK That's twenty-six dollars. \nMOSS You on all night? \nCLERK Yessir, be here til ten tomorrow morning. Moss pushes a hundred along with smaller bills across the desk. \nMOSS For you. I ain't asking you to do anything illegal. The clerk looks at the hundred-dollar bill without reaching. \nCLERK I'm waitin' to hear your description of that. \nMOSS There's somebody lookin' for me. Not police. Just call me if anyone else checks in tonight. \nINT. SECOND-FLOOR HALLWAY - NIGHT \nMoss is mounting the stairs from the lobby. The carpeted hallway is lined by transom-topped doors. Moss goes to a door halfway down on his left. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nMoss enters a room with old oak furniture and high ceilings. He sets the document case next to the bed. He unzips the duffel and takes out the shotgun which he lays on the bed, and then goes to the window. He parts the curtain to look down. The street is empty. Mexican music floats up faintly from a bar somewhere not far away. \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER \nThe room is dark. The music is gone. We are looking straight down on Moss lying, clothed, on the bed. We are booming straight down toward him. After a beat he shakes his head. He opens his eyes, grimacing. \nMOSS There just ain't no way. He sits up and turns on the bedside lamp. The shot gun and document case are on the floor by the bed. Moss swings the document case onto the bed and unclasps it and upends the money onto the bed. He feels the bottom of the case, squeezing it with one hand inside and one hand out, looking for a false bottom. He eyeballs the case, turning it over and around. He starts riffling money packets. He finds one that binds. It has hundreds on the outside but ones inside with the centers cut out. In the hollow is a sending unit the size of a Zippo lighter. \nHe holds the sender, staring at it. A long beat. \nFrom somewhere, a dull chug. The sound is hard to read-a compressor going on, a door thud, maybe something else. The sound has brought Moss's look up. He sits listening. No further sound. Moss reaches to uncradle the rotary phone by the bed. He dials 0. We hear ringing filtered through the handset. Also, faintly, offset, we hear the ring direct from downstairs. After five rings Moss cradles the phone. He goes to the door, reaches for the knob, but hesitates. \nHe gets down on his hands and knees and listens at the crack under the door. An open airy sound like a seashell put to your ear. Moss rises and turns to the bed. He piles money back into the document case but freezes suddenly-for no reason we can see. A long beat on his motionless back. We gradually become aware of a faint high-frequency beeping, barely audible. Its source is indeterminate. Moss clasps the document case, picks up his shotgun and eases himself to a sitting position on the bed, facing the door. He looks at the line of light under it. The beeps approach, though still not loud. A long wait. At length a soft shadow appears in the line of light below the door. It lingers there. The beeping-stops. A beat. Now the soft shadow becomes more focused. It resolves into two columns of dark: feet planted before the door. Moss raises his shotgun toward the door. A long beat. Moss adjusts his grip on the shotgun and his finger tightens on the trigger. The shadow moves, unhurriedly, rightward. The band of light beneath the door is once again unshadowed. Quiet. Moss stares. \nThe band of light under the door. Moss stares. Silently, the light goes out. Something for Moss to think about. He stares. The hallway behind the door is now dark. The door is defined only from his side, by streetlight-spill through the window. Moss stares. He shifts, starts to rise, doesn't. A beat. A report -- not a gunshot, but a stamping sound, followed by a pneumatic hiss. \nIt brings a dull impact and Moss recoils, hit. He winces, feeling his chest. The door is shuddering creakily in. It is all strange. Moss gropes in his lap and picks something up. The lock cylinder. The creaking door comes to rest, ajar. Moss fires. The shotgun blast roars in the confined space and for an instant turns the room orange. The chewed-up door wobbles back against the jamb and creakily bounces in again. Moss has already risen and is hoisting the document case. \nFROM OUTSIDE HIS WINDOW Moss finishes draping his shotgun by its strap across his back and climbs out onto the ledge with the document case. He swings the document case out and drops it. The bracketing for the hotel's sign gives Moss a handhold. He grabs it as inside the room the door is kicked open. Moss swings down as, with a muted thump, orange muzzleflash strobes the room. Moss drops. \nEXT. HOTEL EAGLE SIDEWALK - NIGHT \n", "test1_true": "He looks at his own shadow thrown onto the street. He plunges through the doors into the lobby as a gun thumps and crackling shot chews the sidewalk. \nINT. LOBBY - NIGHT \nMoss hurries across the lobby. A glance to one side: A booted foot sticks out from behind the front desk. Moss slows approaching the stairway. He risks a look around the stairway wall. Ascending balusters fade off into the blackness of the second- story hallway. Moss sags. He looks back across the lobby at the front door. \nHe unhitches his shotgun. He remains still for a moment holding the shotgun, back against the protected side of the wall. He quickly swings out and with shotgun aimed up the stairs he crosses to the back lobby. He quietly pushes open the back door. \nEXT. SERVICE ALLEY - NIGHT \nOUTSIDE Moss emerges into a shallow service alley, dark and dirty. He is at a run when we hear soft tock and a garbage can in front of him snaps and wobbles. He turns looking up, backpedaling. Another tock accompanies a muzzleflash in a dark second-story window. Moss fires his shotgun: loud. Chips fly off the brickface and the window shatters. Moss rounds the alley corner. He stops and squats. \nEXT. DOWNTOWN EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT \nWide: dark, deserted downtown Eagle Pass, Moss a lone figure resting at a corner. Close on Moss panting. He takes stock, painfully feeling at his upper chest where the lock hit, then touching gingerly at his side, beneath the ribs, newly bloody. He sighs. \nHe listens. No noise. He gets to his feet with the document case in one hand and shotgun in the other. He waits a beat, back against the wall. He swings out and fires the shotgun into the alley and then spins back and runs a short block and rounds the next corner and stops to rest. \nEXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT \nHe waits for his breath to slow. He brings up the shotgun and readies himself. He swings out to look back around the corner. The street is empty. \nHe waits, at the ready for whatever might emerge from the alley mouth a short block away. Long beat. Stillness. A panicky thought brings his look and the shotgun swinging back around: the man could round the block the other way. Empty street. Two empty streets: Moss doesn't know which way to cover, which way to go. He stands looking each way, trying to devise a plan. No basis for a plan. Quiet hesitation. Now, a sound: engine noise. An old pickup rounds a corner two blocks up. It rattles toward him. Moss lowers the shotgun. He keeps it to the hidden side of his body. The pickup dutifully stops at a flashing red traffic light. It comes on through the intersection. Moss strides out into the street. He swings the shotgun up and gives the driver a raised palm to halt. \nINT. PICKUP/EXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT \nThe truck stops and Moss opens the passenger door and swings the case in and climbs in after. \nThe driver, an older man, gapes at him, frightened. \nMOSS I'm not going to hurt you. I need you to -- The windshield stars. A quick second round pushes part of the windshield in. Rounds come in without pause, cracking sheet metal, blowing the cab's rear window into the truckbed, twisting the rear- view. A round seems to have caught the driver in the throat: a gurgling scream as he claws at his windpipe, blowing out blood. Moss, quicker to react, has already ducked below the dash. A snap of the driver's head and a new freshet of blood from a shot to the head. The screams turn to low gurgles. Moss, jammed almost in to the driver's lap, frantically gropes for the shift. He throws the pickup into drive and stamps at the accelerator, driving blind as bullets continue to pour in. He raises his head enough to see his side-view. It shows sluing, bouncing, empty street, rough guide for steering. A tremendous jounce up onto the curb then off it, the driver's body swaying in its restraint. The passenger side window shatters: we are passing the gunman. Now Moss sits up to steer looking out front. Behind him through the shot-out back window the dark street is suddenly punctured by muzzleflash. It comes, for the first time, with a report: the low chug of the muted shotgun. Rattle of shot against sheet metal. Moss floors the gas to roar into a turn. The street sweeping out of view behind him produces one more chugging muzzleflash. \nEXT. EAGLE PASS STREET - NIGHT \nThe pickup bounces but Moss, sitting fully up, can now steer. \nHe goes half the length of the block and then yanks the wheel hard, braking. The pickup smashes a parked car and jacks around to a halt. Moss emerges from the pickup with his shotgun and goes to the sidewalk and backtracks. He covers behind a parked car. He sits leaning back against the car, waiting. His point-of-view: his own reflection in the facing storefront, a lot of the driver's blood on him. He sinks lower. A long beat. Footsteps. They approach without hurry. \nA gritty boot turn at the corner. The footsteps come closer still. They pass and recede toward the pickup. We cut to Chigurh approaching the pickup, shotgun held at ease across his body. He slows. Moss: he hears the slowing steps. He tightens his grip on his shotgun and tenses. Chigurh: slowing further, he sees: Bloody boot prints outside the passenger door. Moss rises. Chigurh is turning. He dives as, behind him, Moss fires. Shot peppers two parked cars -- the one Moss rammed and the one behind. Chigurh dived between them: hit or not? Moss advances down the middle of the street. He angles his head: anything under the cars? He fires twice. Buckshot claws up the pavement and the car bodies and tires, and the cars sink hissing to their rims. \nMoss crosses to the far curb, still advancing. No one behind the cars. \nHe looks up and down the street. Nothing to see. He goes to the pickup truck, driver's side. He opens the door and reaches over the driver's corpse for his lap belt. \nEXT. EAGLE PASS BORDER AREA - NIGHT \nDeserted. The pickup truck rattles into frame. Moss emerges. He hoists out the case. He leaves the shotgun. It is very quiet. \nHe looks around. The Rio Grande bridge. Moss walks unsteadily toward it, pressing his free hand to his side. A thought stops him. He turns. His bloody boot prints point at him like comic book clues. His shoulders sag. \nEXT. RIO GRANDE BRIDGE - NIGHT \nMinutes later. Moss heads down the right-hand walkway in stockinged feet, boots tucked into his belt. He turns and looks back toward the U.S. side. Empty walkway. He proceeds on. Three youths are approaching from the Mexican side. Fart types, they are laughing and walking unsteadily. As they approach they gape at Moss, covered with blood. The lead boy, holding a beer, wears a light coat. \nMOSS I'll give you five hundred bucks for your shirt and your coat. \nThe three boys stare at him. \nAT LENGTH: \nYOUTH Let's see the money. Moss unpeels bills from a moist wad. The top one is bloody. \nSECOND YOUTH ...Were you in a car accident? \n", "test2_input": "INT. MAIN ROOM \nSheriff Bell emerges from the bathroom. He sits heavily onto the bed. He looks around, not for anything in particular. His look catches on something low, just in front of him: \nA ventilation duct near the baseboard. Its opening is exposed; its grille lies on the floor before it. \nSheriff Bell stares. At length he leans forward. He nudges the grille aside. On the floor, a couple of screws. A coin. \nEXT. WEST TEXAS CABIN - DAY \nA CAT Licking itself on a plank floor, stiffened leg pointing out. It suddenly stops and looks up, ears perked. A frozen beat, and then it bolts. The camera booms up to frame the barren west Texas landscape outside the window of this isolated cabin. A pickup truck is approaching, trailing dust. The cat reenters frame outside, running across the rutted gravel in front of the house as the pickup slows. \nINT. WEST TEXAS CABIN - KITCHEN - DAY \nEllis, an old man in a wheelchair, has one clouded eye. \nELLIS Min back! Sheriff Bell enters. \nBELL How'd you know I was here. \nELLIS Who else'd be in your truck. \nBELL You heard it? \nELLIS How's that? \nBELL You heard my -- you havin' fun with me? \nELLIS What give you that idea. I seen one of the cats heard it. \nBELL But -- how'd you know it was mine? \nELLIS I deduced it. Once you walked in. Sheriff Bell stares at him. \nBELL How many a those things you got now? \nELLIS Cats? Several. Wal. Depends what you mean by got. Some are half-wild, and some are just outlaws. \nBELL How you been, Ellis? \nELLIS You lookin' at it. I got to say you look older. \nBELL I am older. \nELLIS Got a letter from your wife. She writes pretty regular, tells me the family news. \nBELL Didn't know there was any. \nELLIS She just told me you was quittin'. Sit down. Sheriff Bell lifts an electric percolator off the counter. \nBELL Want a cup? \nELLIS 'Predate it. \nBELL How fresh is this coffee? \nELLIS I generally make a fresh pot ever week even if there's some left over. Sheriff Bell pours some. \nBELL That man that shot you died in prison. \nELLIS In Angola. Yeah. \nBELL What would you a done if he'd been released? \n", "test2_true": "BELL I'm kindly surprised to hear you say that. \nELLIS All the time you spend tryin' to get back what's been took from you there's more goin' out the door. After a while you just try and get a tourniquet on it. He taps a cigarette ash into a mason jar lid on the table in front of him. \nELLIS ...Your granddad never asked me to sign on as deputy. I done that my own self. Loretta says you're quittin'. \nBELL Yes, you've circled round. \nELLIS How come're you doin that? \nBELL I don't know. I feel overmatched. A beat. \nBELL ...I always thought when I got older God would sort of come into my life in some way. He didn't. I don't blame him. If I was him I'd have the same opinion about me that he does. \nELLIS You don't know what he thinks. \nBELL Yes I do. A beat. \nELLIS I sent Uncle Mac's badge and his old thumbbuster to the Rangers. For their museum there. Your daddy ever tell you how Uncle Mac come to his reward? Sheriff Bell shrugs. \nELLIS ...Shot down on his own porch there in Hudspeth County. There was seven or eight of 'em come to the house. Wantin' this and wantin' that. Mac went back in and got his shotgun but they was way ahead of him. Shot him down in his own doorway. Aunt Ella run out and tried to stop the bleedin'. Him tryin to get hold of the shotgun again. They just set there on their horses watchin' him die. Finally one of 'em says somethin' in Injun and they all turned and left out. Well Mac knew the score even if Aunt Ella didn't. Shot through the left lung and that was that. As they say. \nBELL When did he die? \nELLIS Nineteen zero and nine. \nBELL No, I mean was it right away or in the night or when was it. \nELLIS Believe it was that night. She buried him the next mornin'. Diggin' in that hard caliche. A beat. \nELLIS ...What you got ain't nothin' new. This country is hard on people. Hard and crazy. Got the devil in it yet folks never seem to hold it to account. \nBELL Most don't. \nELLIS You're discouraged. \nBELL I'm... discouraged. \nELLIS You can't stop what's comin. Ain't all waitin' on you. The two men look at each other. Ellis shakes his head. \nELLIS ...That's vanity. After a beat, a fast fade. \nEXT. GRAVESITE - ODESSA - DAY \nIn black we hear the chink-chink-chink of chain being played out and the hum of a motor. We cut to a dark foreground shape being lowered in sync with the clinking sound. As it drops it clears a tombstone \nPROGRESSIVELY REVEALED: The name, Agnes Kracik. Her dates: 1922-1980. The inscription: Beloved Mother. Off that we cut to Carla Jean, standing by in a black dress and dark veil. \nEXT. A SMALL SUBURBAN HOUSE - DAY \nA parched square of grass in front of the house. A rusty station wagon pulls into the driveway and stops. Carla Jean gets out. \nINT. KITCHEN \nCarla Jean enters and puts on the kettle. She opens the cupboard looking for something. \nKITCHEN - LATER Carla Jean sits at the kitchen table drinking tea. She looks out the window. Across the street kids are running through a sprinkler that chugs in the yard. \nINT. BEDROOM \nBEDROOM DOOR \nThe door opens and Carla Jean enters holding her hat and veil. She throws the light switch and stops, hand frozen, looking into the room. After a beat: \n", "test3_input": "CARLA JEAN I knew this wasn't done with. Chigurh sits at the far end of the room in the late-afternoon shadows. \nCHIGURH No. \nCARLA JEAN I ain't got the money. \nCHIGURH No. \nCARLA JEAN What little I had is long gone and they's bill aplenty to pay yet. I buried my mother today. I ain't paid for that neither. \nCHIGURH I wouldn't worry about it. \nCARLA JEAN ...I need to sit down. Chigurh nods at the bed and Carla Jean sits down, hugging her hat and veil. \nCARLA JEAN ...You got no cause to hurt me. \nCHIGURH No. But I gave my word. \nCARLA JEAN You gave your word? \nCHIGURH To your husband. \nCARLA JEAN That don't make sense. You gave your word to my husband to kill me? \nCHIGURH Your husband had the opportunity to remove you from harm's way. Instead, he used you to try to save himself. \nCARLA JEAN Not like that. Not like you say. \nCHIGURH I don't say anything. Except it was foreseen. A beat. \nCARLA JEAN I knowed you was crazy when I saw you settin' there. I knowed exactly what was in store for me. \nCHIGURH Yes. Things fall into place. \nEXT. HOUSE \nMinutes later. A beat. The front door swings open and Chigurh emerges. He pauses with one hand on the jamb and looks at the sole of each boot in turn. He goes to the pickup in the driveway. \nINT. PICKUP/EXT. INTERSECTION - A MINUTE LATER \nHe is driving. His point-of-view: coming upon an empty intersection, his light green. Back to Chigurh. He just starts to turn his head to the right. A huge crash. \nEXT. INTERSECTION \nChigurh's pickup has been T-boned by an old crate of a pickup. Both vehicles slide to a halt amid broken glass in the middle of the intersection. The windshield of the truck that ran the light is mostly gone. The driver is draped dead on the wheel. After a beat the door of Chigurh's truck is pushed open. He staggers out, heavily favoring one leg where the jeans are shredded and bloody at the thigh. One arm is also bloody and hangs limp. Blood runs down his face from a scalp wound. He staggers to a lawn and sits. He looks up. Two teenage boys have come out of somewhere. They goggle at him. \nBOY 1 Mister there's a bone stickin' out of your arm. \nCHIGURH I'm all right. Let me just sit here a minute. \nBOY 2 There's an ambulance comin. Man over yonder went to call. \nCHIGURH All right. \nBOY 1 Are you all right? You got a bone stickin' out of your arm. \nCHIGURH What will you take for that shirt? The two boys look at each other. They look back. \nBOY 2 What shirt? \nCHIGURH Any damn shirt. I need something to wrap around my head and I need a sling for this arm. Boy 2 unbuttons his shirt. \nBOY 2 Hell mister, I'll give you my shirt. \n", "test3_true": "BOY 1 Look at that fuckin' bone. \nCHIGURH Tie this for me. The two boys look at each other. \nCHIGURH ...Just tie it. Boy 2, the one now wearing a T-shirt, ties it. Chigurh pulls a bill clip from his pocket and draws a bill out with his teeth. He holds it out to the boy. \nBOY 2 Hell mister, I don't mind helpin' somebody out. That's a lot of money. \nCHIGURH Take it. Take it and you didn't see me. I was already gone. \nBOY 2 Yessir. Wide on Chigurh limping off. \nWe can just hear the boys, small: \nBOY 1 Part of that's mine. \nBOY 2 You still got your damn shirt. \nBOY 1 That ain't what it was for. \nBOY 2 Maybe, but I'm still out a shirt. \nINT. BELL'S KITCHEN - DAY \nLoretta pours Sheriff Bell and then herself morning coffee. \nBELL Maybe I'll go ridin. \nLORETTA Okay. \nBELL What do you think. \nLORETTA I can't plan your day. \nBELL I mean, would you care to join me. \nLORETTA Lord no. I'm not retired. A beat. Sheriff Bell sips his coffee. \nBELL Maybe I'll help here then. A beat. Loretta takes a sip. \nLORETTA Better not. They both sip. \nLORETTA ...How'd you sleep? \nBELL I don't know. Had dreams. \nLORETTA Well you got time for 'em now. Anything interesting? \nBELL Well they always is to the party concerned. \nLORETTA Ed Tom, I'll be polite. \nBELL Okay. Two of 'em. Both had my father. It's peculiar. I'm older now'n he ever was by twenty years. So in a sense he's the younger man. Anyway, first one I don't remember so well but it was about meetin' him in town somewheres and he give me some money and I think I lost it. The second one, it was like we was both back in older times and I was on horseback goin' through the mountains of a night. \nEXT. SNOWY MOUNTAIN PASS - NIGHT \nWe cut to night, and snow. It is the image that the movie began with. Continuing in voice over: \nVOICE OVER ...goin' through this pass in the mountains. It was cold and snowin', hard ridin'. Hard country. He rode past me and kept on goin'. Never said nothin' goin' by. He just rode on past and he had his blanket wrapped around him and his head down... The rider passes as described, horses' hooves drumming and scattering divots of earth and snow. \nVOICE OVER ...and when he rode past I seen he was carryin' fire in a horn the way people used to do and I could see the horn from the light inside of it. About the color of the moon. And in the dream I knew that he was goin' on ahead and that he was fixin' to make a fire somewhere out there in all that dark and all that cold, and I knew that whenever I got there he would be there. Out there up ahead. The rider recedes and the image fades, the horn bearing fire going last. \nTHE END \n"}

{"test1_input": "A distant range of mountains. No movement. He stoops to examine the trail. \nHe paces it 'til he finds a print clear enough to give him the animal's orientation. He stands and looks again toward the distant mountains. He brings up the binoculars. His point-of-view: landscape, swimming into focus, heat waves exaggerated by the compression of the lens. Panning, looking for the animal. Movement, very distant. The animal is brought into focus: a black tailless dog, huge head, limping badly, phantasmal by virtue of the rippling heat waves and the silence. Moss lowers the glass. A moment of thought as he gazes off. \nHe turns and heads in the direction from which the dog came. \nEXT. RISE NEAR BASIN - MINUTES LATER \nMoss tops a rise. He scans the landscape below. Not much to see except-distant glints, off something not native to the environment. Moss brings up the binoculars. Parked vehicles: three of them, squat, Broncos or other off- road trucks with fat tires, winches in the bed and racks of roof lights. On the ground near the trucks dark shapes lie still. \nEXT. BASIN - MINUTES LATER \nMoss is walking cautiously up to the site, unslung rifle at the ready. Flies drone. He circles two dead bodies lying in the grass, covered with blood. A gut-shot dog of the same kind we saw limping toward the mountains lies beside them. A sawed-off shotgun with a pistol stock lies in the grass. The tires and most of the window glass are shot out of the first pickup Moss approaches. He opens the door and looks inside. \nThe driver is dead, leaning over the wheel. Moss shuts the door. \nHe opens the door of the second truck. The driver, sitting upright, still in shoulder harness, is staring at him. Moss stumbles back, raising the rifle. The man does not move. The front of his shirt is covered with blood. \nMAN Agua. Moss stares at him \nMAN ...Agua. Por Dios. \nMOSS Ain't got no water. On the seat next to the man is an HK machine pistol. Moss looks at it. He looks back at the man. The man is still staring at him. Without lowering his eyes Moss reaches in and takes the pistol. Moss straightens up out of the truck and slings the rifle back over his shoulder. He snaps the clip off the machine pistol, checks it and snaps it back on. Moss crosses to the back of the truck and lifts the tarp that covers the truck bed. A load of brick-sized brown parcels each wrapped in plastic. He throws the tarp back over the load and crosses back to the open cab door. \nMAN Agua. \nMOSS I told you I ain't got no agua. You speak English? A blank look. \nMOSS ...Where's the last guy? \nThe injured man stares, unresponsive. Moss persists: \nMOSS Ultimo hombre. Last man standing, must've been one. Where'd he go? \nMAN ...Agua. Moss turns to scan the horizon. He looks at the tire tracks extending back from the truck. He thinks for a beat. \nMOSS \n(TO HIMSELF) I reckon I'd go out the way I came in... He starts off. \nThrough the truck's open door: \nMAN La puerta... Hay lobos... \nMOSS \n(WALKING OFF) Ain't no lobos. \nEXT. FLATLAND NEAR THE BASIN - LATER \nMoss stops to look out at a new prospect. Flatland, no cover. He raises the binoculars. \nMOSS If you stopped... to watch your backtrack... you're gonna shoot my dumb ass. He doesn't see anything. He lowers the glass, thinking. He raises the glass again. \nMOSS ...But. If you stopped... you stopped in shade. He sets off. \nEXT. NEAR THE ROCK SHELF - DAY \nA POINT-OF-VIEW \nThrough the binoculars, some time later. One lone shelf of rock throws shade toward us. Heat shimmers in between. \nHard sun makes the rock shadow impenetrable. But there is a booted foot sticking into the sun toe-up like the nub on a sundial. Moss lowers the binoculars. He looks at his watch. \n", "test1_true": "FAST FADE \nEXT. NEAR THE ROCK SHELF - DAY \nTHE WATCH \nMoss lowers the wristwatch and raises the binoculars again. The shadow has shifted. The foot hasn't moved. Moss gets up and walks toward it. \nEXT. ROCK SHELF - MINUTES LATER \nMoss arrives at the rock shelf. The man's body is tipped to one side. His nose is in the dirt but his eyes are open, as if he is examining something quite small on the ground. One hand holds a .45 automatic. Next to the body is a boxy leather document case. Moss looks at the man. He takes the gun, looks at it, sticks it in his belt. He drags the document case away from the body and opens it. Bank-wrapped hundreds fill it. Each packet is stamped \nMoss stares. He reaches in to rifle the stacks, either to confirm that the bag is full or to estimate the amount. He stands, looks around, looks back the way he came. \nEXT. CATTLEGUARD ROAD - DAY \nHIS TRUCK Moss's pickup is parked by a cattleguard off a paved but little-used road. Moss is just arriving. He throws in the document case, the rifle and the machine pistol, climbs into the cab and slams the door. \nEXT. DESERT AIRE TRAILER PARK - TWILIGHT \nMoss's truck pulls into a trailer park that sits alongside the highway on the outskirts of Sanderson, Texas. An old sign with a neon palm tree identifies the park as the Desert Aire. \nMoss gets out of the truck next to a double-wide. Lights glow inside. He takes the case and machine pistol, gets down on his back next to the trailer and scoots underneath it. His point-of-view: plywood and plastic pipes. He pulls some insulation aside and crams the machine pistol up under the pipes. \nINT. TRAILER - NIGHT \nMoss enters carrying the document case. A twentysomething woman in cutoff jeans and a halter top watches TV. This is Carla Jean. \nCARLA JEAN What's in the satchel? \nMOSS It's full a money. \nCARLA JEAN That'll be the day. Moss is crossing to a back bedroom. Before he disappears inside Carla Jean sees the pistol stuck in the back of his waistband. \nCARLA JEAN ...Where'd you get the pistol? \nMOSS At the gettin' place. \nHe emerges without the case or the gun and crosses to the refrigerator. He takes a beer from the refrigerator and peels its pulltab. \nCARLA JEAN Did you buy that gun? \nMOSS No. I found it. \nCARLA JEAN Llewelyn! \nMOSS What? Quit hollerin'. He walks back sipping the beer and sprawls on the couch. \nCARLA JEAN What'd you give for that thing? \nMOSS You don't need to know everthing, Carla Jean. \nCARLA JEAN I need to know that. \nMOSS You keep running that mouth I'm gonna take you in the back and screw you. \nCARLA JEAN Big talk. \nMOSS Just keep it up. \nCARLA JEAN Fine. I don't wanna know. I don't even wanna know where you been all day. \nMOSS That'll work. \n", "test1_id": 45, "test2_input": "WOMAN Hello? \nCHIGURH Is Llewelyn there? \nWOMAN Llewelyn?! No he ain't. \nCHIGURH You expect him? The woman's voice is old, querulous: \nWOMAN Now why would I expect him? Who is this? Chigurh stares for a short beat, then prongs the phone. \nINT. A SMALL GENERAL STORE - DAY \nMoss is standing in front of a rack of cowboy boots at the back of the store. He looks up at an approaching salesman, a bow-legged old man in a white shirt. \nSALESMAN Hep you? \nMOSS I need the Larry Mahan's in black, size 11. \nSALESMAN Okay. \nMOSS You sell socks? \nSALESMAN Just white. He gathers up a brown paper bag from a pharmacy. \nMOSS White is all I wear. You got a bathroom? \nINT. BATHROOM - DAY \nMoss is sitting on the toilet taking off socks with bloody soles. Sneakers sit on the floor. The pharmacy bag sits next to them. He sprays disinfectant on his feet. He takes out bandages. \nINT. SHOE STORE - DAY \nMoss is returning. The bowlegged salesman stands in the aisle holding aloft a pair of boots. \nSALESMAN Ain't got Larries in black but I got 'em in osta-rich. Break in easy. \nINT. CAB/EXT. DEL RIO MOTEL - NIGHT \nIt is rolling to a stop in front of Charlie Goodnight's Del Rio Motor Hotel. Moss fishes for his wallet but stops, looking. Parked in the street in front of the motel is an offroad truck with roof lights. \nMOSS Don't stop. Just ride me up past the rooms. \nDRIVER What room? \nMOSS Just drive me around. I want to see if someone's here. The cab rolls slowly up the lot. \nMOSS ...Keep going. His pivoting point-of-view of his room. The window shows a part between the curtains. \nMOSS ...Keep going. Don't stop. \nDRIVER I don't want to get in some kind of a jackpot here, buddy. \nMOSS It's all right. \nDRIVER Why don't I set you down here and we won't argue about it. \nMOSS I want you to take me to another motel. \nDRIVER Let's just call it square. Moss reaches a hundred-dollar bill up to the driver. \nMOSS You're already in a jackpot. I'm trying to get you out of it. Now take me to a motel. The driver reaches up for the bill then turns the cab out of the parking lot onto the hiway. Moss turns to look at the receding lights of the motel. \nEXT. THROUGHWAY INTERCHANGE - NIGHT \n", "test2_true": "Rushing under the lens, lit by headlights. \nFrom high up we see a throughway interchange as Chigurh's Ramcharger takes the right fork of the highway under a green sign for Del Rio. \nINT. THE RAMCHARGER - NIGHT \nChigurh looks down at the passenger seat. On it lies the transponder, powered on but silent. Next to it is a machine pistol with a can-shaped silencer sweated onto the barrel. The transponder beeps once. Chigurh looks up. We are approaching a steel bridge. The headlights pick up a large black bird perched on the aluminum bridge rail. The passenger window hums down. \nChigurh picks up the pistol and levels the barrel across the window frame. The truck bumps onto the bridge, its tires skipping over the seams in the asphalt. As it draws even the bird spreads its wings and Chigurh fires-a muted thump like a whoosh of air. From high overhead: the bullet hits the guardrail making it hum as the Ramcharger recedes and the bird lifts into the darkness, heavily flapping its wings. \nINT. CAFE - MORNING \nMorning. Bell sits drinking coffee. Wendell stands in the aisle handing something over. \nWENDELL He labs from Austin on the man by the highway. Bell takes the papers and starts to look at them. \nBELL What was the bullet? \nWENDELL Wasn't no bullet. This brings Bell's look up. \nBELL Wasn't no bullet? \nWENDELL Yessir. Wasn't none. \nBELL Well, Wendell, with all due respect, that don't make a whole lot of sense. \nWENDELL No sir. \nBELL You said entrance wound in the forehead, no exit wound. \nWENDELL Yes sir. \nBELL Are you telling me he shot this boy in the head and then went fishin' around in there with a pocket knife? \nWENDELL Sir, I don't want to picture that. \nBELL Well I don't either! A beat during which both men picture it, ended by an arriving waitress. \nWAITRESS Can I freshen that there for you Sheriff? The Sheriff's distressed look swings on to her. \nBELL Yes Noreen you better had. Thank you. \nWENDELL The Rangers and DEA are heading out to the desert this morning. You gonna join 'em? \nBELL I don't know. Any new bodies accumulated out there? \nWENDELL No sir. \nBELL Well then I guess I can skip it. Heavens to Betsy, Wendell, you already put me off my breakfast. \nEXT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - DAY \nMoss pushes off from the wall he was leaning against: someone inside the glass double doors is stooping to unlock them. \nINT. SPORTING GOODS STORE - GUN COUNTER - DAY \nThe clerk is handing a shotgun across the counter. \nCLERK Twelve gauge. You need shells? Moss looks the gun over. \nMOSS Uh-huh. Double ought. \nCLERK They'll give you a wallop. He pushes the shells across. \n", "test2_id": 46, "test3_input": "CHIGURH ...I know where you are. \nMOSS Yeah? Where am I? \nCHIGURH You're in the hospital across the river. But that's not where I'm going. Do you know where I'm going? \nMOSS Yeah. I know where you're going. \nCHIGURH All right. \nMOSS You know she won't be there. \nCHIGURH It doesn't make any difference where she is. \nMOSS So what're you goin' up there for. A beat. \nCHIGURH You know how this is going to turn out, don't you? \nMOSS No. Do you? \nCHIGURH Yes, I do. I think you do too. So this is what I'll offer. You bring me the money and I'll let her go. Otherwise she's accountable. The same as you. That's the best deal you're going to get. I won't tell you you can save yourself because you can't. \nMOSS Yeah I'm goin' to bring you somethin' all right. I've decided to make you a special project of mine. You ain't goin' to have to look for me at all. Moss slams the phone onto its hook, then slams it twice more for good measure. Chigurh, in the hotel room, cradles his phone. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nSheriff Bell sits at his usual booth, but with an unaccustomed look: reading glasses. He has been looking at a newspaper but is now peering over his glasses up at Wendell who apparently interrupted his reading. \nBELL The motel in Del Rio? Wendell nods. \nWENDELL Yessir. None of the three had ID on 'em but they're tellin' me all three is Mexicans. Was Mexicans. \nBELL There's a question. Whether they stopped bein'. And when. \nWENDELL Yessir. \nBELL Now, Wendell, did you inquire about the cylinder lock? \nWENDELL Yessir. It was punched out. \nBELL Okay. \nWENDELL You gonna drive out there? \nBELL No, that's the only thing I would've looked for. And it sounds like these boys died of natural causes. \nWENDELL How's that, Sheriff? \nBELL Natural to the line of work they was in. \nWENDELL Yessir. \nBELL My lord, Wendell, it's just all-out war. I don't know any other word for it. Who are these folks? I don't know... He rattles the paper. \nBELL ...Here last week they found this couple out in California they would rent out rooms to old people and then kill em and bury em in the yard and cash their social security checks. They'd torture em first, I don't know why. Maybe their television set was broke. And this went on until, and here I quote... He looks through his glasses at the paper. \nBELL ...\"Neighbors were alerted when a man ran from the premises wearing only a dog collar.\" You can't make up such a thing as that. I dare you to even try. He peers over his glasses at Wendell who respectfully shakes his head and tsks. Sheriff Bell rattles the paper again. \nBELL ...But that's what it took, you'll notice. Get someone's attention. Diggin graves in the back yard didn't bring any. Wendell bites back a smile. Sheriff Bell gazes at him over his glasses for a long beat, deadpan. \nBELL ...That's all right. I laugh myself sometimes. He goes back to the paper. \nBELL ...There ain't a whole lot else you can do. \n", "test3_true": "Moss, a coat thrown over his hospital robe, is standing before a uniformed INS official on the Rio Grande bridge. The official, who looks like a marine drill instructor, is chewing. He chews for a long beat, staring at Moss. \nHe finally spits tobacco juice and pats his lower lip with a handkerchief. \nOFFICIAL Who do you think gets through this gate into the United States of America? \nMOSS I don't know. American citizens. \nOFFICIAL Some American citizens. Who do you think decides? \nMOSS You do, I reckon. \nOFFICIAL That is correct. And how do I decide? \nMOSS I don't know. \nOFFICIAL I ask questions. If I get sensible answers then they get to go to America. If I don't get sensible answers they don't. Is there anything about that that you don't understand? \nMOSS No sir. \nOFFICIAL Then I ask you again how you come to be out here with no clothes. \nMOSS I got an overcoat on. \nOFFICIAL Are you jackin' with me? \nMOSS No sir. \nOFFICIAL Don't jack with me. \nMOSS Yes sir. \nOFFICIAL Are you in the service? \nMOSS No sir. I'm a veteran. \nOFFICIAL Nam? \nMOSS Yes sir. Two tours. \nOFFICIAL What outfit. \nMOSS Twelfth Infantry Batallion. August seventh nineteen and sixty-six to July second nineteen and sixty-eight. \nThe official stares at him, chewing, sour. \nOFFICIAL Wilson! \nGUARD Yessir. \nOFFICIAL Get someone to help this man. He needs to get into town. \nINT. GENERAL STORE - DAY \nThe clerk who earlier sold him the boots: \nCLERK How those Larries holdin' up? Moss is walking up in his boots and overcoat and hospital robe. \nMOSS Good. I need everything else. \nCLERK Okay. \nMOSS You get a lot of people come in here with no clothes on? \n", "test3_id": 47}

MA The world. Living in the hammock house with your Grandma and Grandpa... 
JACK And you. 
We see that Ma doesn't believe she'll get out, but she nods. Bends over and hides her face by putting it against his. 
JACK (CONT'D) Sing. 
Ma kneels back up into position. 
MA One evening as the sun went down and the jungle fire was burning, down the track came a hobo hikin', and he said "Boys, I'm not turning. I'm headed for a land that's far away, beside the crystal fountains. So, come with me, we'll go and see the Big - 
The door beeps, and Ma rolls Jack up, very fast. We're in the dark with him, the rug pressing close. 
Sound of Old Nick stepping in. Proud of himself. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) Antibiotics. 
The door shuts with a boom. OLD NICK (O.S.) (CONT'D) Are you nuts, wrapping a sick kid up in that? 
Ma's voice is very close because she's bent over the rug. 
MA (O.S.) He got worse in the night. 
She waits, giving Old Nick time to figure it out. 
In the rug, Jack lies frozen except for his flickering eyes. 
MA (O.S.) (CONT'D) He wouldn't wake up. 
(CONTINUED) 34   CONTINUED: (3)                                             34 
OLD NICK (O.S.) Are you sure? 
She lets seven years of rage pour out. 
MA (O.S.) Am I sure? 
In the rug, Jack blinks in fright. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) Ah gee.   That's - Poor girl. 
His self-justification kicks in right away. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) (CONT'D) Guess it must have been serious, pills wouldn't have worked anyway. 
MA (O.S.) You killed my baby. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) Take it easy. Let me - 
Jack's eyes squeeze tightly shut: total darkness. 
MA (OVERLAPPING)(O.S.) Keep your hands off him! 
OLD NICK (O.S.) OK, OK. 
Jack opens his eyes again, inside the rug. 
OLD NICK (O.S.)(CONT'D) He can't stay here, you know. 
MA Where will you take him? 
OLD NICK (O.S.) I don't know. I'm thinking. 
MA (O.S.) Not here. I'd feel him. I'd know. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) OK. 
MA (O.S.) Drive him somewhere nice, somewhere with lots of trees. 
(CONTINUED) 34   CONTINUED: (4)                                             34 
OLD NICK (O.S.) Trees, sure. 
MA (O.S.) Keep him wrapped up. Swear you won't even look at him with your filthy eyes. 
OLD NICK (O.S.) I swear. (thinks) It'll be dark in an hour. 
MA (screams at him) Now. I can't bear it. 
OLD NICK OK, OK. 
Jack feels himself being scooped up by Old Nick. 
MA (O.S.) Gently! 
OLD NICK (O.S.) Get back and turn around. 
Jack is tilted head down as Old Nick taps the code. Ma starts to moan quietly. A swaying motion as he carries Jack outside. 
Ma's voice is cut off by the boom of the door. 
35   EXT. OLD NICK'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - DUSK                   35 We're with Jack; glimpses of twilight sky, shrubs, hedge through the end of the carpet. 
A terrible pause as Old Nick contemplates the back yard. Then walks on. Jack is heaved face-down into the flatbed of an old pick-up.

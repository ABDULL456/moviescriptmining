MICKEY Wagons, hooaaa! 
The hostage train starts moving. Wayne's walking backwards with the shotgun barrel pressed against his midsection. Scagnetti's walking back to back with Mickey and his own pistol pressed to his neck. 
Roger follows with the camera. 
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY 
Mallory's sitting Indian style, singing Girl Scout songs to herself, and doing the hand motions. 
MALLORY (singing) Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo. Simplest thing there isn't much to it. All ya gotta do is dodaleedo it. I like the rest, but the best part I like is Whataleeatcha, whataleeatcha dodaleedo, dodaleedo, do quack, quack. 
The cell door opens and the hostage train of Wayne, Mickey, Scagnetti, Roger and the camera, and two DEPUTIES they picked up along the way enters the room. The hostages are all wrapped with tape. 
CU on Mallory. She can't believe her eyes. 
MICKEY (to Mallory) Honey, I'm home. 
Mallory runs into Mickey's arms, passionately kissing. This kiss has been a year coming. Now they're doing something everybody told them they would never do again. 
For this moment they are the only two people on earth. We're enraptured, too. CAMERA does a 360 around the loving couple. 
MALLORY (in between kisses) It's taken you so long to come to me. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JAIL LAUNDRY ROOM - DAY 
A sheet of paper flashes through FRAME. 
BAILEY (O.S.) Here's the list of the rioters. 
CAMERA TILTS to Wurlitzer reading, then looking up. 
WURLITZER Wait a minute, Bailey. Where's the list of the hostages? 
BAILEY (O.S.) I'm working on it Capt'n. 
WURLITZER Keep on it, son. 
Wurlitzer reads the list to himself as he paces. 
WURLITZER (reading the names) Alvarado, Issacs, Julian, Martinez, Newendyke, Olvera, Pool, Ramos, Schmidt, Spivey, Walsh, Westerguard... 
Wurlitzer drops into a chair, exhausted. He rubs his face with his hands. 
NAPALATONI (O.S.) Capt'n. 
Wurlitzer looks up, then looks back down. 
WURLITZER What is it Napalatoni? 
NAPALATONI (O.S.) Mickey Knox is loose. 
Wurlitzer looks up. 
WURLITZER What do you mean he's loose? 
NAPALATONI (O.S.) He's armed, he's killed three deputies and one of Wayne Gayle's guys. At the moment, he's hold up with Mallory Knox in her holding cell with Wayne Gayle, another TV guy, that cop fella, and two other deputies as hostages. And Capt'n, they have one of them news cameras goin' live to KKTV. They won't stop playin' it. What do you want us to do? 
Wurlitzer holds a frozen look, as if a fuse has blown and his mind has shut down. If he were to open his mouth now nothing would come out. He just sits. 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOLDING CELL - DAY 
The hostages have been cut free from each other and sit against the wall. Roger cradles the Betacam in his lap, rocking slowly as if in a trance, while Scagnetti feebly splints his broken fingers with the tape that hangs from his wrists. Wayne is standing, alert and ready for action. 
As for the two deputies, HOSTAGE DEPUTY #1 sits in anger, tight-lipped and stoic. The other, DEPUTY DUNCAN HOMOLKA is panicked and jumpy, one may never see a more nervous man. 
Mickey and Mallory stand over them with their weapons drawn. 
MICKEY Okay, we're going out that door, and we're gonna march down the hall and right out of the building. (to Wayne) Donut said something about a news van. 
WAYNE Yeah, we have a van. 
MICKEY Where's it parked? 
WAYNE Out front. 
MICKEY Let me have the keys. 
Wayne points to Roger. Roger digs through his pocket and tosses the keys to Mickey. 
WAYNE Mickey, can I talk to you alone?

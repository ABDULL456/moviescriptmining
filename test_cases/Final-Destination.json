{"train": "FINAL DESTINATION \n\"FINAL DESTINATION\" \nOriginally Called \"FLIGHT 180\" \nBy James Wong and Glen Morgan \nJanuary 15, 1999 \nAwaiting......each of us; a cold...dark...lonely place. Deny its finality. Deride its totality. Dread the inescapable inevitability......it will arrive. \nThe BLACK SILENT SCREEN senses this moment before a distant blues harp introduces a contemporary band's cover of Blood, Sweat, and Tears' campy, yet haunting, gospel, \"And When I Die.\" \nAs the Introduction closes, RESONATES... A FLASH OF LIGHTING! A CRACK OF THUNDER! \nCUT TO: \nINT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - CLOSE - BED \nAn airline ticket is tossed INTO FRAME beside a suitcase; \"EURO-AIR. FLIGHT #180. New York City (JFK) - Paris, Charles de Gaulle (CDG.) Departure: Thursday 13May. 16H25 - Arrival: Friday 14May. 05H40.\" \n\"And When I Die\" Continues throughout the MAIN TITLES: \nAN OLD TABLE FAN \nswivels beside and open window. Outside, a humid spring THUNDER STORM drops warm, ominous rain. The figure of a seventeen year old boy, ALEX BROWNING, packing for a trip, passing the fan... \nTHE BED \nA Paris guidebook is tossed atop the plane ticket. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON THE BOOK as the fan's breezes flip through the pages. \nTHE TABLE FAN \nturns, head swiveling away from the bed. \nTIGHTER - THE GUIDEBOOK PAGES \nstop flipping, REVEALING A GULLOTINE from the Reign of Terror. As an American passport is dropped beside the guidebook... \nTHE TABLE FAN \nswivels, returning towards the guidebook on the bed. \nTHE GUIDEBOOK PAGES \nFLIP. FLIP. FLIP. Alex's faint shadow continues moving about the room. The fan head swivels away, allowing the pages to settle... upon a Louvre masterpiece, Francisco de Zurbarans Lying-in-the State of St. Bonaventura. \nCAMERA CREEPS IN, teasingly on the dark faced corpse. The pages begin to turn once again. \nTIGHTER, OMINOUS ANGLE - THE DESK FAN \nThere is more of a hint of conincidence as the blades whirl and head swivels. The boy's figure passes, blocking the breeze. \nTHE GUIDEBOOK PAGES \nstop dead on... Jim Morrison's decorated tomb in the Cemetiere du Pere Lachaise. A pilgrim has spray painted \"This is the End.\" Which in fact, it is... of the MAIN TITLE. \nBARBARA Alex... \nCAMERA ADJUSTS, to fully reveal Alex Browning as he turns toward the bedroom door. Alex is an average kid; handsome. A high school \"everyman.\" \nOne the wall amongst Yankee and Knicks posters, hangs a pennant; \"Mt. Abraham High School, New York. The Fighting Colonials!\" Alex's mother, BARBARA, 45, walks in, excited and a bit anxious. \nBARABRA (Cont'd) Tod and George's dad just called, he's picking you up at 10 in the morning. Bus leaves the high school for JFK at noon. \nBarbara moves towards the suitcase to help him pack. Alex's father, KEN BROWNING, 48 appears, leaning against the door threshold, smiling enviously at his son. \nKEN My suitcase workin' out for ya? \nAlex nods and buckles it. Barbara reaches in to tear off an airline baggage I.D. ticket attached from the previous flight. \nALEX Whoa! Whoa! Mom, you gotta leave that on. It's like... the tag made the last flight without crashin' or anything, right? So, it should stay on, or with, the bag for good luck. \nBARBARA Where would you get a nutball idea like that? \nEXTREMELY CLOSE - THE AIRLINE BAGGAGE MARKER \nis torn away from the suitcase handle. \nRETURN \nAs Barbara picks up the suitcase to place it on the floor... a dozen old baggage I.D. tickets spill from the outer compartment. She looks at Ken, as if \"you?\" The guilty party shrugs. \nKEN I'm still here. \nBarbara shakes her head as Alex smiles at his dad. \nKEN (Cont'd) Seventeen and on the loose. Ten days in Paris. In the springtime! Live it up, Alex... \nCAMERA INCHES INTO KEN as he winks at his son... \nKEN (Cont'd) Got your whole life ahead of you. \nALEX \nMr. Murnau scans the group, his expression looking for an answer. Clear Rivers keeps her head in her book as... \nCLEAR The airport doesn't endorse solicitors. \nMR. MURNAU Tres bien, Clear! Tout droit! \nShe doesn't react. Her expression remains cool as Murnau leads the procession forward. The boys continue. Alex sighs... \nALEX Fuh-ck, do we have to put up with that shit the whole time? \nA hand reaches out to gently detain Alex. He looks up to find a HARE KRISHANA, dressed in everyday clothes, but head shaved and a mark on his nose. \nHARE KRISHANA Death is not the end. \nCAMARA PUSHES IN ON ALEX... unsettled by the soft spoken, yet ominous, \"Solicitation.\" The Krishana offers a small book, REALITY BEYOND THE MATTER: VAISHNAVA PHILOSOPHY. \nAs he hands the book to Alex, a female form ENTERS FRAME between them. The women is MISS VALERIE LEWTON, 30, a feisty English teacher whose figure inspires all the boys' fantasies. \nMS. LEWTON It will be for you if you harass my students. \nShe places a hand on Alex's shoulder, herding him to the group. \nHARE KRISHANA (pissy) Hare Rama. \nMs. Lewton turns and, while walking backward, flashes a smile... \nMS. LEWTON (mouths) Fuck off. \nAs she turns her back and continues down the terminal... \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHECK IN DESK - AIRPORT - DAY \nAlex's passport and ticket are set INTO FRAME and picked up by a female TICKET CLERK. Alex waits as she busily types into the computer and checks his passport... \nTICKET CLERK I have a few questions to ask you this afternoon. \nO.S., LOUD, EXAGGERATED plastic tiles rapidly CLICK and CLACK. \nTICKET CLERK (CONT'D) Did you pack these bags yourself? \nThe CLACKING CONTINUES, demading Alex's attention. His eyes turn forward. \nALEX'S POV - THE FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD \nPlastic tabs CLACK rapidly, settling on the word... \"CANCELLED.\" \nALEX \nCAMARA CREEPS IN on his dawning paranoia... \nTICKET CLERK (CONT'D, O.S.) Have your belongings remained in your possession the entire time? \nAlex absently nods. Again, O.S., CLACK CLACK CLACK. His eyes move to... \nALEX'S POV - (TIGHTER) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD \nThe plastic tabs FLIP and CLACK rapidly, stopping on... \"DEPARTED.\" \nTICKET DESK \nAlex is still considering the \"messages...\" \nTICKET CLERK Have you recieved any packages from persons unknown to you? \nAlex quickly runs the day through his head and flashes her the REALITY BEYOND MATTER book. She smiles, then leans over toward the baggage scales. Alex's eyes turn toward... \nCLOSE - (MOTION SLOWED)- ALEX'S LUGGAGE \na new airline I.D. marker is attached to his bag. \nRETURN \nAlex eyes the new tag hoping it's \"good luck.\" As the clerk returns his ticket and passport... CLACK, CLACK, CLACK. \nTICKET CLERK Same as your birthday. \nAlex is puzzeled by the comment. He shakes his head if, \"pardon me?\" CAMERA INCHES INTO the ticket clerk gesturing pleasantly to the passport and ticket... \nTICKET CLERK (CONT'D) April 25th. Four-twenty-five... your birthday is the same as your departure time. \nCLACK. CLACK. CLACK. Alex's eyes flash toward... \nALEX'S POV - (FULL FRAME) - FLIGHT INFORMATION BOARD \nthe title settles upon... \"TERMINAL.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT.  SECURITY AREA - AIRPORT - MONITOR \nThe ghastly green and reds of the X-ray monitors flash as carry on bags flash through the machine. CAMERA MOVES COUNTER to the direction of the conveyor belt. The pace and excitement of the collective group escalates as departure approaches. \nCarter Horton and his girlfriend, Terry, take cuts in line with smug, bullying expressions. Unseen by the chaperones, no student, has the nerve to protest Carter's action. Alex, Tod, George and BILLY HITCHCOCK, heavyset with a New York Rangers jersey watches Carter and Terry with disgust. \nINT. BOARDING AREA - GATE 39 - CLOSE - ALEX'S BOARDING PASS \nis torn along the perforated edge and handed back. \nALEX \nlooks down the paasenger ramp. \nALEX'S POV - RAMP TUNNEL \nCAMERA CREEPS toward it... lit to cheat a feeling of no return. O.S., distant THUNDER RUMBLES... \nWIDER \nThere is something more emotionally tense about the moment of boarding than take-off. CAMERA PICKS UP Ms. Lewton searching... \nMS. LEWTON Anyone seen Billy Hitchcock? How'd we lose him? \nTod nudges Alex toward the tunnel, the three boys start down the ramp, passing Mr. Murnau who checks his list, counting heads... \nMR. MURNAU Vingt huit, vingt neuf... \nPASSENGER RAMP \nAlex, Tod, and George catch up to Christa and Blake, excited. As always, everyone becomes bottlenecked just at the point of entering the plane. Alex looks out the ramp's side porthole window toward the back of the plane. \nALEX'S POV - THROUGH PORTHOLE \nThe enormous engine. The expansive wings. Behind the tail, distant, a bolt of lightning FLASHES! \nALEX \nlooks away. Just ahead, in the plane, FLIGHT ATTENDANTS greet the passengers. He is next to enter the plane. \nCLOSE - FLOOR \na slice of opening from where the ramp meets the plane provides a sense of how high up one actually stands. \nALEX \nCAMERA PUSHES INTO HIM as he takes his first step into the plane. \nCLOSE - AIRLINE CABIN FLOOR \nAlex's Nikes land on the carpet. \nINT. 747 - FIRST CLASS CABIN - AFTERNOON - CLOSE - BABY \nSCREAMS! Its parents desperately comfort the child. \nCAMERA ADJUSTS, LEADING George, Alex and Tod through the aisles. Alex and Tod wince at the screaming child. George, however feels comforted. \nGEORGE Good sign. Younger the better. It would be a fucked-up God to take down this plane. \nINT. ECONOMY CLASS CABIN - 747 - AFTERNOON \nIn the first row slumps a young man with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis. A cannula is set in his nostrils leading to an oxygon tank beside him. \nThe kids sneak sympathetic yet anxious glances at the man while continuing in their seats. George whispers over his shoulder... \nGEORGE A REALLY fucked-up God. \nAlex's tension increases as he continues up the aisle. \nALEX'S POV - OVERHEAD COMPARTMENTS \nCAMERA INCHES IN ON \"Row 25. Seats H, I, and J.\" \nALEX \nclimbs into the row, carrying his backpack. He takes his window seat and reaches up to the air flow valve. \nCLOSE - AIR FLOW VALVE \nturns, HISSING, air streaming full blast. \nCAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as he takes in deep breaths of the stale air. He presses his face to the window. \nALEX'S POV - THE LEFT WING \nRain falls. GEARS WHIR as the ailerons are tested. \nCLOSE - ALEX \nCAMERA CREEPS TOWARD HIM, face to the glass; eyes scanning the plane and outside area. \nCHRISTA (O.S.) Alex? \nHe turns toward the aisle. \nALEX'S POV - CHRISTA AND BLAKE \nMan, they look great and they're workin' the sex appeal. \nCHRISTA Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together? I asked Tod, but he says he's got some medical thing? \nHustling toward the door. Mr. Murnau gestures toward Ms. Lewton as if \"talk to her.\" He disappears down the ramp. CAMERA PUSHES IN as airline personnel CLOSE THE DOOR...with an ominous THUD. \nEXT. GATE 39 - AFTERNOON - CARTER, TERRY & BILLY'S POV \nFlight 180 pulls out of the gate, taxiing toward the runway. \nINT. GATE 39 - OBSERVATION WINDOW - AFTERNOON \nCarter turns over his shoulder, looking back angrily towards Alex. Terry wraps a calming/restraining arm around Carter's shoulder, but he starts towards Alex, seated with Ms. Lewton. \nMENS ROOM ACROSS FROM GATE 39 \nTod races out of the bathroom with a dampened paper towel. CAMERA FOLLOWS as he hands it to Ms. Lewton seated next to Alex. The teacher places it on Alex's forehead. \nTOD I called your mom and dad and they're on their way. \nMS. LEWTON Alex, talk to me. What happened? \nAlex looks at Tod, who nods. His friend's expression is soothing and open. With lowered tense tone, meant for only the two people beside him... \nALEX I... I saw it... like, I don't know... the plane took off. I saw it leave the runway... I looked down and saw the ground... \nMs. Lewton and Tod exchange concered glances. \nALEX (CONT'D) And then the cabin banged and the left side exploded. The the whole plane... blew up. It was so real. Exactly how everything goes. \nTOD Been on many planes that blew up, have you? \nGood point. Alex looks away. \nMS. LEWTON You must have fallen asleep. \nCARTER We get thrown off the plane and blow a half day in Paris because Browning has a bad dream? (mocking Alex) It's going to explode! It's going to explode! \nTOD Fuck off, Horton. \nMS. LEWTON Tod... \nA raw nerve, Alex stands. \nALEX Only trip you're gonna take is to the fuckin' hospital. \nCarter scoffs while moving aggressively toward Alex. \nCarter makes a quick move and grabs Alex. The two security guards rush in to break it up. Chaos erupts agian as the two boys wrestle in the terminal. \nOBSERVATION DECK \nCAMERA PUSHES INTO Billy Hitchcock, depressed as he watches the plane take off... \nBILLY There they go and here we stay. \nAIRPORT TERMINAL \nOne guard restrains Alex; another Carter. In the b.g. out of the observation deck window... Flight 180 lifts off the runway. \nCARTER You're payin' for my trip, Browning! \nALEX I wish you were on the plane! \nIn the b.g. the 747 head and taillights suddenly, violently, ERUPT into a gigantic fireball of flame. \nIt takes a few seconds for the CONCUSSION to hit the terminal, but when it does... BOOM! A window SHATTERS! Chairs rock! People are knocked off their feet. \nCAMERA SWEEPS INTO ALEX... stunned as he turns to the window... \nALEX'S POV - FLIGHT 180 \nThe unceremonious speed of obliteration of hundreds of lives is cruel as flaming debris plummets from the early evening sky. \nCLEAR RIVERS \nCAMERA PUSHES IN ON HER, rattled, afraid, but aware of Alex as she is first to turn her eyes toward him. \nGATE 39 \nBilly Hitchcock walks backward from the window, shocked by shocked step. Ms. Lewton drops to her chair as her legs give out. \nO.S., ALARMS BEGIN. The two security guards tear off toward more urgent duties. O.S., OUTSIDE, SIRENS WAIL as emergency vehicles race to the tragedy. \nCAMERA BEGINS TO MOVE toward ALEX... as Tod's head turns toward him, then Terry's... then Carter's. In the chair, beginning to cry, Ms. Lewton eyes Alex, as if afraid of him. \nCAMERA CONTINUES. SIRENS PIERCING. The emergency vehicles' strobing red lights reflect in Alex's eyes, now in TIGHT as he looks out, frozen with shock... upon the doomed FLIGHT 180. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT \nSILENCE \nA pair of Airline REPRESENTATIVES sit with the seven survivors, each numb with shock. Everyone is too raw with residual fear to show any emotion. They sit on folding metal chairs in an empty room, too bright from the fluorescent lights. Beneath their obvious trauma resulting from the catastrophe... each feels uneasy by Alex's presance. \nThe others sit away from Alex and Tod. Alex appears wrought with guilt. He checks the others out of the corner of his eye. \nALEX'S POV - THE ROOM \nHe considers, owing them an explanation. The he realizes... \nALEX Because... I... never thought it would really happen. \nWeine leans foward... \nWEINE If that's the case, Alex... why did you really get off the plane? \nCAMERA INCHES IN as Alex considers, confused, emotional... \nCUT TO: \nINT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - TOD \nCAMERA CONTINUES THE MOVE on Tod... as if just realizing... \nTOD My brother... told me to keep an eye on Alex. He stayed... and I went to make sure Alex was okay. (a whisper) He told me to get off the plane. INT. A SECOND ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - MS. LEWTON \ndisplaying a similar sickened expression as Tod... \nMS. LEWTON Larry Murnau told me to get back on... but I told him to go. (pause, guiltily) I sent him back on the plane. \nINT. A ROOM - AIRPORT - NIGHT - WEINE \nWEINE No one forced you to get off the plane. You told us you aren't friends with any that did... so, why did you leave the airplane? \nCLEAR RIVERS \nCAMERA INCHES IN as she looks up. With total resolve... \nCLEAR Because I saw and I heard Alex. And... I believed him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JFK INTERNATIONAL BUILDING - PRESS ROOM #10 - NIGHT \nThe surviviors have all returned to the room. They may be a group, but they are alone with their thoughts. The door is opened by Ms. Whale. \nAlex's Mother and Father lead by a group of parents into the room. Each moves with grief, yet relief, to their child. \nBarbara Browning grabs hold of Alex and holds him tight. The mother begins to cry. Ken Browning, eyes welling with tears, grabs his son's hand and squeezes. Alex does not cry. While holding his mother, he watches the others. \nALEX'S POV - CARTER AND TERRY \nTheir parents are concerned, but do not demonstratively show affection. Carter appears as if he wants to hug his MOTHER, but he can't bring himself to betray his self-image. \nALEX \nhis eyes moves toward... \nCLEAR RIVERS \nalone, hurt that no one has come to take her home. \nALEX \nhis eyes find... \nTOD AND HIS FATHER \nJERRY WAGGNER holds his son, both of them releasing anguished tears. Through his grief, however, Jerry stares at Alex with an expression of anger and accusation. \nALEX \nCAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he holds his mother tightly. OVERLAPPING... A CRACK OF THUNDER! \nCUT TO: \nINT. KEN BROWNING'S CAR - NIGHT \nAlex sits in the back against the door, looking out the window at the storm. Clear Rivers is pressed against the other door. Everyone is slient. Outside, the STORM angrily rages. \nAlex is unaware that Clear is watching him, searching for some answer that she will not now find. She looks up. \nCLEAR Here's good. \nThe car pulls over. \nCLEAR Thank you for the ride. She opens the door and flashes one more look at Alex, but he appears unaware. She exits the car and as the door SHUTS... \nCUT TO: \nINT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe room is empty, but the CAMERA is SLOWLY MOVING, as if ITSELF a PRESENCE. O.S., FOOTSTEPS move up the stairs. Alex appears, his parents behind him. He clicks on the light, sending a soft, safe, orange glow across the room. \nALEX \nstands in the threshold of the doorway. His mother places a comforting hand on his shoulder. \nALEX'S POV - PENNANT \nMt. Abraham High School Fighting Colonials. \nALEX \nTOD \nturns on the faucet and grabs his toothbrush, squeezing paste onto the bristles. \nCLOSE - FAUCET \nthe f.g. running water is out of FOCUS. In the b.g. sits an unplugged radio. \nTOD \nnotes the radio. CAMERA FLLOWS HIS HAND as he grabs the plug. \nTHE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR \ngrows closer to his foot... \nELECTRICAL SOCKET \nthe radio plug is inserted. \nTOD \nturns on the radio... \nJOHN DENVER (V.O.) And they say that he got crazy once and he tried to touch the sun. \nspooked, quickly turns it off, unplugs it and pushes it aside. \nTHE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR \ncontinues to grow... \nCUT TO: \nINT. ALEX'S BEDROOM - NIGHT - NEWSPHOTO - CLEAR RIVERS \nOdd how one can appear so erotic at a funeral. \nALEX \nstudies the photograph, then notices the rose she gave him. Succumbing to guilt, feeling like the freak all teenagers believe they are, Alex sets the paper back on the desk. He grabs the Penthouse and turns, opening the desk drawer in order to return the magazine, however... \nA LOUD BANG turns Alex's head to the window! \nALEX'S POV - WINDOW \nAn OWL has apparently smashed into the window, awkwardly flapping its large wings, then turns its head toward Alex, large yellow eyes shining like an alien creature. \nWIDER \nStartled, Alex reflexively throws the Penthouse across the room, pages tearing as it hits the sill. The giant bird flies off. \nTHE TABLE FAN \nswivels, a page catching in the whirling blades. \nA PIECE OF PAPER \ntorn form the magazine flits across the room. \nALEX \nCAMERA INCHES IN ON HIM as the piece of paper ENTERS FRAME, floating and flitting until landing on his knee. He picks it up and turns it over... \nALEX'S POV - PIECE OF PAPER \nis torn in such a manner that the only lettlers remaining from the centerfold's caption are \"...Tod...\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT - SHOWER CURTAIN \nis pulled aside REVEALING two pairs of Linda Waggner's nylons drying on a retractable clothesline. \nTHE PUDDLE ON THE FLOOR \nhis foot slips... \nTOD \nfalls foward. \nTHE RETRACTABLE CLOTHESLINE \nretracts! WHIPPING wildly! \nTHE SOAP DISH \nTod's hand tries to grab anything to hold him. His hand slips, knocking over a bottle of shampoo. \nTOD'S NECK \nthe thin clothesline coils around his neck. The plastic anchor wraps beneath the cord, essentially creating a noose. \nPUDDLE ON THE FLOOR \nCAMERA PUSHES, LOW ANGLE, INTO WILLAIM BLUDWORTH, an African-American man, early 50's, dressed in dark suit and tie. \nMR. BLUDWORTH You'll wake the dead. \nHe flashes a dry mortician's smile, pleased by his wan pun. Alex and Clear haven't recovered from the corspe's actions to calmly address Bludworth.. \nALEX Why..? \nAlex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body. Bludworth nods, understanding... \nMR. BLUDWORTH Chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasm. \nAs the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on Alex that they have been busted. He nervously offers an explanation. \nALEX I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father... \nMR. BLUDWORTH (ominous) I know who you are. The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area. \nCLEAR They said he hung himself, but there's no marks. \nMR. BLUDWORTH I crafted a reconstruction of the Laryngeal prominence region with Velvetone Surgical Wax and Permaseal. \nClear moves in for a closer look, then calls Alex over to the body. After a beat of reluctance, Alex looks at Tod's neck. \nALEX What are all those tiny marks? \nALEX'S POV - CLOSE - TOD'S NECK \nThe wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint. At this proximity, however, it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire. \nMR. BLUDWORTH (V.O.) Cuticle lacerations. WIDER \nALEX Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide? CLEAR Why would they say it was a suicide... if it weren't? \nBecause of the supernatural \"message\" he recieved, Alex is reluctant to answer. He eyes Mr. Bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation. \nALEX His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son. \nMR. BLUDWORTH In Death... \nCAMERA INCHES TOWARD the mortician. In this environment, lit with Fritz Lang shadows, Bludworth's tone, appearance... he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject. \nMR. BLUDWORTH ... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps. (smiles) And no... escapes. \nALEX You saying Tod did kill himself? \nBludworth moves to Tod on the draining table, disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals. \nMR. BLUDWORTH Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What does it matter? He was going to end someday. From the minute you're cut loose from the womb... it's a one way ticket on a trip to the tomb. \nVile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table. \nMR. BLUDWORTH You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave. \nALEX Design? \nThe mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. He shrugs then continues his work... \nMR. BLUDWORTH If Life is like a box of chocolates... Death... Death is like a big Milton Bradley game of \"Mouse Trap.\" The day you're born is just the boot, hanging from the streetlamp, kicking the marble to get things rolling. Growing up is only the marble rolling down the curving chute. You feel immortal having survived school, sex, drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really only upset the big hand holding the steel ball that falls into the bathtub. Marriage and kids and career seem to make it all worthwhile until the ball hits the see-saw and flips the diving man into the big barrel. In the old folks home or the hospital you just see the big cage rattling down until it captures... the mouse. (beat) Game over. \nAlex considers as Clear eyes him, conveying \"this guys's whacked!\" Alex moves toward Bludworth... \nALEX Maybe there's no way to win... but... if you figured out the game... you knew where the \"steel ball was rolling\" couldn't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time? Couldn't you... cheat Death at Its own game? \nMr. Bludworth looks directly at Alex. CAMERA MOVES IN ON EACH, INDIVIDUALLY... this between the two of them. \nMR. BLUDWORTH You already did that by walking off the plane. Now you gotta out when and how it'll come back at you. (beat) Play your hunch, Alex. If you think you can get away from it. (beat) But beware the risk of cheating the plan, disrespecting the design... could iniciate a horrifying fury that would terrorize even the Grim Reaper. (beat) And you don't even want to fuck with that Mack Daddie. \nAlex's eyes are locked on Bludworth's chilling, pleasant smile. The mortician yanks on a tube, REVEALING a foot long needle removed from Tod's spinal column. The horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to Alex. \nALEX I'm sorry we broke in. \nMR. BLUDWORTH No harm. No foul. \nAlex grabs her arm, starting toward the door. \nCLEAR We didn't find what we were looking for. \nAlex looks at Bludworth... \nALEX Yeah, we did. \nMR. BLUDWORTH \nCAMERA PUSHES INTO the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved. \nMR. BLUDWORTH I'll see you soon. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nBRAKING LOUDLY, startlingly, a public bus PULLS INTO CAMERA and stops. The doors HISS open. \nCLEAR (O.S.) The mortician was whacked. \nCLOSE - ALEX'S HAND \nslides across the table. Opening his hand REVEALS the piece of paper reading, \"... Tod...\" Clear's hand ENTER'S FRAME to take the paper. CAMERA FOLLOWS AS SHE raises it, her expression obviously puzzled. As she eyes Alex for an explanation, CAMERA CRANES DOWN QUICKLY to the empty paper cups on the table... \n... a slight approaching BREEZE knocks them over. \nDOWN THE STREET - HEADING WEST \nA somewhat cherry 70's muscle car speeds in the direction of the Starbucks. Carter Horton is driving. Terry Chaney rides shotgun. Carter looks out the window. \nCARTER'S POV - MOVING - ALEX AND CLEAR \nShe holds the paper as Alex, apparently, explains the story. \nCARTER'S CAR \nCARTER scowls, his anger rising as he slows, staring at the perceived reasons for his problems. \nALEX AND CLEAR \nHer eyes turn from the paper to Alex, concerned about him... \nCLEAR I don't understand... did you see Tod die? Did it happen again, like \t\ton the plane? \nALEX No, but it might as well be the same thing. This was a message... from someone, or something... hinting... at the design. \nCLEAR Alex, on the plane... you must have experienced... some kind of hyper awareness. But here... you're suggesting Tod's death... and maybe our own... will happen because of... an active Presence. \nAlex nods, feeling she's understanding. \nALEX The mortician said Death has a design. Now... if you, me, Tod, Carter, Terry, Billy, Ms. Lewton messed up that design, because, for whatever reason, I was able to see Death's plan... then we cheated it. (beat) But what if it was our time, what if we were not meant to get off that plane? What if it is still is our time? If... It... is still not finished with us? We will all still die; now, not later. \nTroubled and deeply concerned, Clear studies Alex. \nALEX (CONT'D) Unless... we find the pattern. And cheat it again. \nClear sets the paper down, looking sadly at Alex. \nCLEAR After hearing you, just now... I do believe... Alex leans back and sighs, relieved... \nCLEAR (CONT'D) ...that Tod killed himself. \nAlex is taken aback, hurt and angry. \nALEX Then there's no one left who can help me. \nCARTER'S CAR \nHis eyes having never left Alex, Carter suddenly cranks the wheel hard to the left to make a tight U-Turn. \nBILLY HITCHCOCK \nrides his bike. He reacts, startled by... \nBILLY HITCHCOCK'S POV - CARTER'S CAR \nbarreling down towards him. The car cuts in front of the bicycle to complete the U-Turn. \nWIDER \nBilly SWERVES to the left, directly in front of an oncoming car. The car SWERVES right, as does Billy, avoiding a certain fatal collision for the cyclist. The oncoming car HONKS! \nCarter's car pulls up to the curb. Oblivious to the accident he almost caused, Carter gets out, strutting toward the tables outside the coffee shop. Inside the car, Terry sighs... \nTERRY Baby, come on... not now. \nBut her boyfriend continues. She gets out and hustles after him. \nALEX AND CLEAR \nTheir attention drawn by the commotion, Clear and Alex watch Carter Horton approach them, followed by Terry, who stops, irked, near the curb at the crosswalk. \nTERRY Carter... \nAt that moment, Ms. Lewton exits with an ezpresso drink. Sensing trouble, she has no energy or desire to involve herself. \nCARTER Kind of have a reunion, here. \nTERRY Let it go! \nCarter steps before Ms. Lewton, blocking her exit... \nCARTER When are you moving? \nMS. LEWTON A couple of weeks. \nShe can't wait to leave. While trying to walk around Carter... \nCARTER We're losing our favorite teacher. \nALEX Look, there's something you should all know. \nCLEAR Alex... \nCarter eyes Alex, continuing the taunt.

Clear tenses, however... \nSCHRECK If he should contact you, it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us. \nSchreck hands his card. She takes it and nods.

A slow, sick spin. \nALEX \nbreaths deep into his oxygen cup. \nThe JET ENGINES GRIND AND WHIR, as if the craft were in the midst of a last-ditch effort to regain stability; the sounds DEAFENING over the PASSENGERS' cruelly hopeless SCREAMS. \nThen... \nKA-BOOM \nA DEVASTATING EXPLOSION ERUPTS across the cabin, blasting a five foot hole in the fuseluge. Human limbs and blood spray, craft and passengers torn to shreds. \nDead students sit lifeless in their seats. \nEvery unrestrained object on board flies to the hole and through the fire; paper, books, luggage, pillows. A PARENT and a STUDENT clutch their seat in terror, SCREAMING before they are pulled into the sky. \nWind. Screams. Dying engines, a deafening blare. \nALEX AND TOD \nSCREAM, pale, knowing there is no hope, no escape as the ENGINES DIE. The cabin begins to tilt downwards... then straight down. Debris tumbles toward the flight deck as if falling from a cliff. \nOUTSIDE... the sick familiar SOUND of an aircraft going down. \nALEX is strapped to his seat, upper body facing downward toward the water. FIRE, WIND, AND BLOOD WHIP across him.

Alex? \nALEX \nDrenched with sweat, trembling in his seat, his eyes dart toward Christa and Blake. They look great and they're workin' the sex appeal. \nCHRISTA Could you trade seats with Blake so she and I can sit together? I asked Tod, but he's got some medical thing. \nAlex turns sickeningly disoriented. His eyes dart about, searching for evidnece of the catastrophe. There are none to be found. Alex blots from his seat, startling the two girls. He scrambles toward Tod, who looks at his friend, concerned. \nTOD Dude, what up? \nFrenzied, Alex climbs over his friend, on top of the seat. Alex's panic has alerted the other students and a MALE FLIGHT ATTENDANT who makes his way to the row. \nALEX \ngrabs the tray table latch before the vacent seat. IT BREAKS OFF, JUST AS BEFORE. CAMERA PUSHES INTO ALEX, terrified. He begins to hyperventilate. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Is there a a problem, sir? \nAlex's wild eyes and expression convey \"no fucking kidding there's a problem.\" The flight attendant realizes this passenger is experiencing a serious episode. \nDirectly across the aisle, Carter Horton and Terry look at him with severe expressions. \nCARTER What's your fuckin' problem? \nMr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton unfasten their seat belts and rush toward Alex. \nMR. MURNAU Alex? Qu'est-ce se? \nALEX Qu'est-ce se?! THE PLANE'S GONNA EXPLODE! \nObviously, no one ever wants to ever hear that. The students tense. \nTHE FLIGHT ATTENDANT \nimmediately turns to other attendants, signaling for assistance with a quick definite gesture. In the b.g., attendants hustle toward the economy class cabin. \nCARTER AND TERRY \nCARTER                TERRY Shut up, Browning!       You're not funny. \nALEX \nfrenzied, begins moving toward the aisle. \nALEX We have to get out! \nThis frightens everyone.

Take it        Sir, if this is a joke, easy.                                 we don't tolerate such humor. \nThe flight attendant restrains Carter with an extended forearm. \nALEX I'm not joking! I'm not joking! \nMs. Lewton and Mr. Murnau move to the seats. Flight attendants try restraining Alex from reaching the aisle. \nMS. LEWTON               \t       MR. MURNAU Alex, Knock it off. It's alright.       Settle down, Alex. \nALEX Listen to me! This plane will explode on take-off! \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Sir, we will remove you from the aircraft if this continues. \nCARTER I'll remove him. \nALEX Fuck you! I'll remove myself! \nCarter reaches for Alex, who pushes back, trying to get out. Carter responds aggressivly and now the flight attendant, Tod, and the two teachers are in the midst of the melee. \nThe Co-Pilot arrives to secure the situation. He grabs Alex and begins forcibly ushering him up the aisle. \nA male flight attendant choke holds Carter from the back. Carter struggles but the attendant's postioning has the advantage. He begins removing Carter from the plane as well. \nTERRY He didn't do nothin'! \nShe follows the attendant, hitting him to help her boyfriend. \nJust arriving in the cabin, Billy Hitchcock tries to fight past a STEWARDESS to get to his seat. He is blocked by the mass of combatants as they are escorted out. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT (he's had it) Anybody in the aisle is off the plane! \nBILLY No, wait, I was late... that's my seat right there! \nUnder protest, Billy gets pushed back off the plane. Mr. Murnau and Ms. Lewton follow the pack of students and airline personnel as they move toward the exit, calling out to seated teachers and parents while hustling up the aisles. \nMS. LEWTON                       MR. MURNAU Everybody just stay where you    Mr. Carpenter, keep an eye on are.

Billy is confused by the chaos. \nBILLY I didn't do anything! I have my ticket right here! \nArriving SECURITY OFFICERS quickly have control of the situation. Alex is taken to a seat at the gate and dropped there by the co-pilot, who, winded, eyes the officers. \nCO-PILOT You got this? \nThe officers nod. One moves toward Carter as he dropped in a seat away from Alex. Terry sits behind Carter. \nThe co-pilot and attendants start back toward the plane. Ms. Lewton hustles over to them and an airline representitive. \nCO-PILOT No one gets back on board. That's my call. \nMS. LEWTON PLEASE... I've got forty students going to Paris... \nDuring these negotiations...

You're off the plane... \nRattled, Alex attempts to compose himself. Ms. Lewton appears, hurriedly pulling aside Mr. Murnau. \nMS. LEWTON Airline's not taking this very well. They'll let one of us back on and the rest can grab a six-ten flight. Gets in two hours later at DeGaulle. It's alright. It's not that big of a deal. \nMR. MURNAU I'll stay. \nMS. LEWTON No, you know the whole French thing. Get on the plane. \nMurnau understands this point and takes off toward the boarding ramp door. Pleading his case, Billy follows Murnau. \nBILLY I was in the bathroom. The lock was stuck. I didn't fight with anyone! \n", "test1_id": 2622, "test2_input": "CARTER Hope you don't think, Browning, that because my name ain't on this wall... that I owe you anything. \nALEX I don't. \nCARTER (re: victims) All I owe is these people. (turns to Alex) To live my life to the fullest. \nAlex winces from Carter's breath... \nALEX Then maybe you should lay off the J.D. \nCarter has an angry reflexive reaction, grabbing Alex threateningly by the forearm. Terry immediately tries to get Carter to release his hold. \nCARTER Don't ever fucking again tell me what to do. I control me. Not you. \nCarter and Alex lock eyes, Alex refraining from showing any pain caused by Carter's grip. Terry finally gets him to release. \nCARTER I'm never gonna die. \nHe moves off. Terry, however, holds a beat, eyes Alex and gently rubs the area of his arm, as if this is the only manner she can extend her gratitiude in Carter's presence. As Alex pats her arm, Terry quickly moves off. \nShaken, Alex considers whether to move foward to the memorial. He steps aside to let the others go ahead as Billy Hitchcock, who has finished paying his respects, spots Alex and heads back up the line. \nBILLY I took my driver's test this week at the DMV... \nAlex turns to him, increudlously.. \nBILLY Got a 70. Lowest score, but I passed. When I was done with the test, the guy who drives with you during the test, he goes, \"Young man, you're going to die at a very young age.\" (beat) That true? ALEX Not here, not now. (beat) Not EVER! \nBilly sighs, and moves OUT OF FRAME, only to quickly RE-ENTER... \nBILLY If I ask out Cynthia Paster, will she say \"no?\" \nAlex flashes Billy an angry glare. He gets the message and moves off, for good. Alex returns in line, moving toward the memorial. \nValerie Lewton places a rose at the base of the memorial then studies the engraved names as the students move past behind her. Alex approaches, watching her as she reaches out with a trembling finger, touching the etched names... \nCLOSE - MEMORIAL \nLinda Krauss... Thomas Lewis... John McConnell. \nRETURN \nAlex stands near her, sympathetically, understanding her pain.... \nALEX Ms. Lewton... \nHer eyes fill with tears and fear. Alex places a comforting hand on her shoulder, but she reacts quickly, pulling away from him, her eyes piercing at him. \nMS. LEWTON Don't talk to me. You scare the hell out of me. \nAlex is shattered as the teacher moves away. Tod ENTERS and faces the memorial. \nTOD (a greeting) Hey. \nAlex notices Tod is in line behind him. Alex looks around for Tod's father. He is not in line... \nALEX I don't want to sound gay, or nothin, but... I miss you. \nTod subtly nods, reaching out to the memorial. \nCLOSE - MEMORIAL \nTod's hand moves across his brother's name... GEORGE WAGGNER. \nRETURN \nAs Tod longs for his brother, then looks at his friend. \nTOD Me, too. (beat) But my dad doesn't understand. When he's better; you and me, road trip to the City. Catch the Yanks. \nALEX That's a plan. \nTod nods. The two friends stand uncomfortably foar a beat before Tod gestures to the podium. \nTOD I gotta go. This thing Ms. Lewton showed me in her class, they're gonna let me read it. It says what I'm feeling. \nTod holds his friend's arm for strength as he passes. Clear Rivers appears in line, holding a rose. She looks at the memorial, before her startling eyes turn to Alex. Even away from these circumstances, Alex would have trouble handling her intense maturity. As he begins to step away, she thrusts the rose to him. He looks up, puzzled. \nCLEAR Because of you... I'm still alive. Thank you. \nAlex takes the rose and she walks away. CAMERA PUSHES IN ON HIM as he eyes... feels... the red flower. \nTOD (V.O.) We say that the hour of death cannot be forecast... \nTIME CUT: \nEXT. MT ABRAHAM HIGH SCHOOL - DAY - THE PODIUM \nTod nervously stands before the assembly, reading aloud with a sad, yet optimistic resolve.

LIVING ROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT \nA lone light glows. Jerry Waggner has fallen asleep, perhaps passed out, reclined in \"dad's chair.\" Tod's mother is asleep on the sofa, balls of tissue on the floor.

REALITY BEYOND MATTER: Vaishnava Philosophy. \nAlex studies his mountain of research, increasingly obsessed. \nAn O.S. paper FLUTTER draws his attention to the newspaper being blown by the fan. He reaches out and grabs it. Headlines and photos report on the memorial service. \nCAMERA PUSHES IN as he sighs, troubled... \nALEX'S POV - NEWSPHOTO \nClear Rivers sits in her seat, legs crossed, alluring and sexy and mysterious. \nALEX \ncloses the paper, puzzled by his reaction. He shakes it off and throws the paper on the desk. Alex considers for a beat, then pulls open a lower drawer. Digging through the mess inside, he finds his stash... the April 1997 issue of Penthouse. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - WAGGNER HOUSE - NIGHT \nAlight CLICKS on REVEALING an old, '20's built bathroom. The toilet is beside the bathtub/shower, with just enough knee space to the counter cabinets when one lifts the toilet seat. \nTod puts the lid down and UNSNAPS his jeans. As he turns, pulls his pants down and sits, CAMERA MOVES to the CURTAINS... still... until a cold soft breeze causes them to billow. CAMERA FOLLOWS the wind as it CONTINUES into the room, rippling across shower curtains. \nAs the breeze passes Tod, he pauses... as if sensing, but not understanding... this is more than a wayward autumn breeze. He moves to close the window, however, CAMERA CONTINUES as the air makes ITS way to the door. \nThe door is softly pushed closed by the breeze. \nBACK OF THE TOILET TANK \nTod sits, back to CAMERA, which CRANES DOWN the tank, STOPPING behind the locking nut and water line pipe. \nAs the toilet FLUSHES O.S., CAMERA NOW MOVES INTO the locking nut, which begins to slightly rattle.

He pauses in the doorway as he spots Alex in the front yard. \nALEX \nis pale, nauseous. His eyes follow his friend's dead body as it is rolled toward the paramedics vehicle. Tod's father approaches Alex, the agents stand nearby. \nALEX What... what happened? \nMr. Waggner glares at Alex, accusingly. \nMR. WAGGNER Didn't you... \"see\" it? \nAlex is stung, guilty. He averts his eyes. Schreck and Weine note this reaction. \nMR. WAGGNER (CONT'D) Couldn't you \"predict\" it? Couldn't you read his mind? Alex remains silent, hurt. \nALEX Mr. Waggner... \nMR. WAGGNER You caused Tod so much guilt over George staying on the plane that...

After you got over George. Why would he make plans for the future if he were planning on killing himself? \nMR. WAGGNER All my wife and I will ever know is we wouldn't have lost our youngest son... if you'd told our oldest to get off the plane. \nAlex is rocked as if having taken a punch to the face. Mr. Waggner begins to walk toward the peramedics vehicle. Alex eyes the F.B.I. agents, who, after studying for a beat, turn and move toward their vehicle. \nThe gathered spectators begin whispering to one another, clearly about Alex, causing him to search for, what appears to be, his only ally, Clear Rivers. \nALEX'S POV - ADJACENT YARD \nClear is gone. \nFRONT YARD \neveryone has moved away from Alex, leaving him very alone.

The feet and CAMERA HOLD until CRANING UP to REVEAL Alex, staring at the leaf with an expression reminiscent of the torn paper's message about  \"...Tod.\" \nCLEAR  (O.S.) Almost Autumn. \nAlex looks off toward a small unkept house, nestled at the edge of the woods. In the open garage stands Clear Rivers amongst cluttered artwork, supplies and tools. Her t-shirt's sleeves have been cut off and neck-line cut low. Her jeans have a revealing hole at the spot which once was a back pocket. She wears heavy black work shoes. A dog rests nearby on the floor. \nALEX It's only the end of June. \nCLEAR (shrugs) Yeah, but everthing's always in transition. If you focus, even now, one week into summer... you can feel Autumn coming. (beat) Almost like bein' able... to see the future. \nAlex reads her intention loud and clear. She returns to her artwork. The dog GROWLS softly as Alex appraches the garage. \nINT/EXT. GARAGE - CLEAR RIVERS' HOUSE - DAY \nEntering the garage, Alex gets a closer look at her artwork. It's abstract sculpture and canvas work and pretty bad, at that. \nCLEAR Know what this is? \nShe gestures to him to approach her. He tenses, awkward, but moves closer. Clear lifts a plastic cover off a canvas. Beneath is a mess of green and brown and orange; teen angst poorly communicated. Glued to the center is a twisted piece of metal. \nALEX Like, um... you're mad about something? \nShe sighs, \"thanks a lot,\" then proud, but not enough to make her appear foolish over her bad artwork, indicates the metal. \nCLEAR A piece of debris... from the plane. I went to the shore off the crash site and it washed up on the beach. \nALEX You went there? I've wanted to go there, but I thought it was off limits. \nCLEAR It is. But that didn't stop me. Shouldn't stop you. \nAlex gently touches the piece of the plane, almost expecting to feel something more than cold metal. He looks to Clear... \nALEX Why were you there last night? \nWhile she cleans brushes with a can of turpentine... \nCLEAR Look, I've seen enough T.V. to know the F.B.I. doesn't investigate teen suicides. But they were there last night, that means: one, they still don't have a clue what caused the crash. Two, they haven't ruled out anything. And the fact that seven people got off the plane is probably weird enough, not to mention, that one of those people had a vision, or whatever, of it exploding minutes before it did explode, is highly suspicious. And it doesn't help that the visionaries' friend just committed suicide. \nAlex eyes her for a long beat. She turns away from him, returning the can of turpentine to a shelf. \nALEX Why were you there last night? \n", "test3_true": "CLEAR Know what this is? \nAlex, cocks his eyebrow probably thinking, \"a mess?\" but tactfully shakes his head \"no.\" \nCLEAR It's you. \nRemaining dry and stoned faced, Alex tenses, uncomfortable. \nCLEAR Not a likeness. It's how you make me feel, Alex. \nALEX I'm... really sorry. \nCLEAR Like you, the sculpture doesn't even know what, or why, it is. Reluctant to take form. And, yet, creating an absolute but incomprehansible attraction. \nUncertain, and yet moved, Alex listens. \nCLEAR (CONT'D) Before that day, you were just another suburban nothing that would never have anything to do with my life. And I'm sure you thought I was some Marilyn Manson body-pierced freak, or whatever. (beat) But at that moment... on the plane... I felt what you felt. I didn't know where all those emotions were coming from until you started freaking out. \nAlex sighs, embarrassed. \nCLEAR (CONT'D) I didn't see what you saw, but I felt it. Okay, I'm not into all that X-Files bullshit... but it was a psychic connection. Why to me? Why to you? \nJarred, he eyes her, frightened. \nCLEAR And you can still feel it, can't you? Something from that day is still with you. I know, because I can still feel you. \nAlex is increasingly uncomfortable with the subject, but eased by Clear's apparent, somewhat, understanding. Lowering his tone... \nCLEAR That's why I was there last night. \nALEX I've never dealt with death before. I wasn't alive when my grandparents died. I wish I could know. I mean, all this... could just be in our heads. Now it feels like it's everywhere. \nCLEAR \"It?\" ALEX What if Tod... is just the first... of us? \nThe idea sends a shot of apprehension through Clear. CLEAR Is that something you're \"feeling?\" \nALEX I don't know. I wish I could just see him... one more time, then, maybe... I would know. \nCLEAR Then, let's go see him! \nAlex reacts, shocked and yet her impulsiveness is exciting... \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Clear leads the way. lifting the frame, then dropping it throught the skylight window. \nAlex is not as smooth as his socius criminus. Using his knee to slow his descent, he hangs from the sill for a moment before dropping to the carpet. \nCAMERA MOVES WITH Alex and Clear through the unsettling reception area; plastic flowers, gold candelabra, plaster cherubs and angels. A bronze plaque identifies: \"MT. ABRAHAM FUNERAL HOME. THE JOURNEY'S END. WILLIAM BLUDWORTH - INTERMEDIARY.\" \nCLEAR (whispering) Gives me a rush... \nALEX This place?! \nCLEAR Doin' somethin' I'm not supposed to. \nWith a hot, mischievous smile, Clear proceeds toward the hallway. Alex anxiously sighs... then follows. \nINT. DOWNSTAIRS HALLWAY - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT \nAn elevator with collapsible metal door lowers INTO FRAME. Pushing the door aside, Alex and Clear proceed into the hallway, lined with morgue green tile. Stainless steel gurneys and porcelain equipment holding yellow surgical tubing and thick foot-long needles sit in the corridor. \nA faint light spills from beneath a doorway. Clear reaches out to the knob but Alex quickly grabs her hand. From a cart behind them, he pulls a latex glove out of a box and snaps it on. \nCLEAR Good call. Very \"Quincy.\" \nAlex tries the doorknob. Locked. He looks at her, defeated. Clear quickly points to some mortician's tools on the cart. \nFrom it, Alex produces a thin six inch needle. He inserted the tool in the lock and jimmies the doorknob. CLACK! \nINT. MORGUE - FUNERAL HOME - NIGHT \nA lone desk lamp shines. Across the room, laying on a porcelain table, fluid draining tubes attached, lies Tod. A sheet is pulled up to his shoulders. He carries the macabre appearence of a corspe having been made up by a mortician. Hair combed and sprayed, skin tone too orange, blush too rouge and lips too red. \nAs Alex and Clear approach... \nALEX That... him? \nCLEAR I think. But why'd they make him up like...

Thanks, Alex. \nAlex crames up into the aisles, making his way to Tod, sitting two rows up in 22 H. \nAlex climbs over Tod to take the window seat.

BLUDWORTH You'll wake the dead. \nHe flashes a dry mortician's smile, pleased by his wan pun. Alex and Clear haven't recovered from the corspe's actions to calmly address Bludworth.. \nALEX Why..? \nAlex completes his question by raising his hand, ala Tod's dead body. Bludworth nods, understanding... \nMR. BLUDWORTH Chemicals in the vascular flush create cadaveric spasm. \nAs the startle of the situation settles, it dawns on Alex that they have been busted. He nervously offers an explanation. \nALEX I'm... a friend of his. His best friend. See, his father... \nMR. BLUDWORTH (ominous) I know who you are. The mortician eyes Alex, understanding. Alex senses this and eases. Clear moves toward Tod's body, examining the neck area. \nCLEAR They said he hung himself, but there's no marks. \nMR. BLUDWORTH I crafted a reconstruction of the Laryngeal prominence region with Velvetone Surgical Wax and Permaseal. \nClear moves in for a closer look, then calls Alex over to the body. After a beat of reluctance, Alex looks at Tod's neck. \nALEX What are all those tiny marks? \nALEX'S POV - CLOSE - TOD'S NECK \nThe wounds have been filled with wax and covered by greasepaint. At this proximity, however, it is apparent tiny cuts line the area above and below the large cut made by the wire. \nMR. BLUDWORTH (V.O.) Cuticle lacerations. WIDER \nALEX Why would he pull at the wire if he were committing suicide? CLEAR Why would they say it was a suicide... if it weren't? \nBecause of the supernatural \"message\" he recieved, Alex is reluctant to answer. He eyes Mr. Bludworth, who, with a wry half smile, eyes Alex as if aware of the reason behind his hesitation. \nALEX His father's pretty fucked up with denial. Maybe he couldn't deal with the thought of an other accident... taking another son. \nMR. BLUDWORTH In Death... \nCAMERA INCHES TOWARD the mortician. In this environment, lit with Fritz Lang shadows, Bludworth's tone, appearance... he could easily be mistaken for personification of the subject. \nMR. BLUDWORTH ... there are no accidents. No coincidencess. No mishaps. (smiles) And no... escapes. \nALEX You saying Tod did kill himself? \nBludworth moves to Tod on the draining table, disconnecting the tubes connecting the body to the embalming chemicals. \nMR. BLUDWORTH Suicide. Murder. Plane crash. What does it matter? He was going to end someday. From the minute you're cut loose from the womb... it's a one way ticket on a trip to the tomb. \nVile liquid oozes out of the body onto the porcelain table. \nMR. BLUDWORTH You may not realize it, but we're all just a mouse that a cat has by its tail. Every single move we make, from the mundane to the monumental... the red light we stop at, or run; the people we have sex with, or won't with us; the airplane we ride, or walk out of... is all a part of Death's sadistic design leading to the grave. \nALEX Design? \nThe mortician considers as he drains some yellowish green fluid from the table. He shrugs then continues his work... \nMR. BLUDWORTH If Life is like a box of chocolates... Death... Death is like a big Milton Bradley game of \"Mouse Trap.\" The day you're born is just the boot, hanging from the streetlamp, kicking the marble to get things rolling. Growing up is only the marble rolling down the curving chute. You feel immortal having survived school, sex, drugs 'n' rock 'n' roll, but you've really only upset the big hand holding the steel ball that falls into the bathtub. Marriage and kids and career seem to make it all worthwhile until the ball hits the see-saw and flips the diving man into the big barrel. In the old folks home or the hospital you just see the big cage rattling down until it captures... the mouse. (beat) Game over. \nAlex considers as Clear eyes him, conveying \"this guys's whacked!\" Alex moves toward Bludworth... \nALEX Maybe there's no way to win... but... if you figured out the game... you knew where the \"steel ball was rolling\" couldn't you avoid the trap and extend the playing time? Couldn't you... cheat Death at Its own game? \nMr. Bludworth looks directly at Alex. CAMERA MOVES IN ON EACH, INDIVIDUALLY... this between the two of them. \nMR. BLUDWORTH You already did that by walking off the plane. Now you gotta out when and how it'll come back at you. (beat) Play your hunch, Alex. If you think you can get away from it. (beat) But beware the risk of cheating the plan, disrespecting the design... could iniciate a horrifying fury that would terrorize even the Grim Reaper. (beat) And you don't even want to fuck with that Mack Daddie. \nAlex's eyes are locked on Bludworth's chilling, pleasant smile. The mortician yanks on a tube, REVEALING a foot long needle removed from Tod's spinal column. The horrific nature of death is vividly demonstrated to Alex. \nALEX I'm sorry we broke in. \nMR. BLUDWORTH No harm. No foul. \nAlex grabs her arm, starting toward the door. \nCLEAR We didn't find what we were looking for. \nAlex looks at Bludworth... \nALEX Yeah, we did. \nMR. BLUDWORTH \nCAMERA PUSHES INTO the mortician, pleased the message has been recieved. \nMR. BLUDWORTH I'll see you soon. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

He nods, \"it's safe to go.\" Throughout the following, his eyes are searching for anything potentially deadly. \nALEX He said Death has a design. Even before he said that I had been seeing patterns. \nCLEAR (sarcastic) As in flannels and plaids? \nUp ahead, scaffolds rise before a building being restored. O.S., HAMMERING and CONSTRUCTION WORK POUND from above. In the f.g., tools and metal spikes. After a \"thumbs up\" gesture, the rope is pulled UP AND OUT OF FRAME. \nALEX How many died on Flight 180? From our group? \nCLEAR Thirty-nine. \nALEX Remember the gate number? \nAs Clear takes a moment to consider, Alex steers them well around the scaffolds, eyes skyward during the move... \nCLEAR No. \nALEX Thirty-nine. \nThis is a creepy fact. Even though past the construction, Alex checks over his shoulder to assure they are out of harm's way. \nALEX Remember the departure time? \nCLEAR Like... 4:25. \nReaching an intersection, Alex pushes the pedestrian traffic light button, then steps well away from the curb. \nPEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL \nthe halting red hand is lit. \nALEX (V.O.) Do you know when I was born? \nINTERSECTION \nClear sighs, growing impatient with Alex. \nCLEAR \nALEX Right. April 25th. \nCLEAR Wait. I thought you meant the time of your birth. Four/Twenty-five, as in, month and day... that's a reach. \nPEDESTRIAN TRAFFIC SIGNAL \nthe halting red hand turns to the little white walking man. \nINTERSECTION \nClear takes a step off the sidewalk and onto the street. Alex tugs her back, looking both ways while outraged by her challenge. \nALEX My birthday is the same as of the time I was meant to die! That's a reach!? \nVROOM! A car indeed makes a right, TEARING through the intersection. Once past, Alex takes Clear by the arm and hustles them across the street. \nCLEAR You're sounding like those people who, you know... \"Oswald shot Kennedy from a warehouse and hid in a theatre and Booth shot Lincoln in a theatre and hid in a warehouse.\" \nCAMERA HOLDS REVEALING an unmarked sedan parked across and down from a Starbucks with outdoor seating.

STARBUCKS - DAY \nsitting outside, Alex hunches over the table, increasingly anxious. Clear listens; expression skeptical. \nALEX I'm not just layin' down a bunch of math here, with this. I'm talking about indications... omens... that day, that we were meant to die. That, if, we have been aware of... would have saved everyone on the plane. \nCLEAR That's total bullshit. You can find death omens anywhere you want to. \nShe picks up her paper coffee cup. \nCLEAR (CONT'D) Hey, look! \"Coffee\" starts with a \"C\" and ends with an \"E.\" So does the word \"choke!\" We're going to choke to death! Oh no! Starbuck was a whaler. We're going to be harpooned! \nAlex angrily glares at Clear. Clear drops her tone. \nCLEAR (CONT'D) You'll go nuts if you start with that shit. \nMs. Lewton appears from around the corner. She starts toward the entrance, but pauses, tensing when she sees Alex. \nHe cautiously flashes a greeting smile. The teacher, however, averts her eyes and continues into the coffee shop. Alex sighs, guiltily. Clear sympathizes with both of them. \nCLEAR She's leaving the school. Moving away. \nAlex studies, appealing to her... \nALEX Clear, how do we know that by just sitting here, breathing this air or sipping the coffee, having crossed the street... we haven't started in motion the events that will lead to our death? Fifty years from now. Ten years. Tomorrow. (beat) You don't unless... you're able to open yourself to the signs I'm willing to show you. \nHe leans foward, removing a peice of paper from his pocket. \n", "test2_id": 2623, "test3_input": "Alex appears unaware as he simply runs past Billy, who curiously turns his head to watch Alex race up the street.

Weine accepts the explanation. Schreck's eyes take a walk around the artwork in the garage, pausing on a piece of twisted metal from the crash. Clear tenses, however... \nSCHRECK If he should contact you, it would be in the best interest of your own safety to contact us. \nSchreck hands his card. She takes it and nods.

Nearing the shadows, the two boys stop looking at the monument. \nCarter pulls put a heavy pocket knife and starts attempting to cut into the stone. \nClear Rivers appears from the shadows. \nCLEAR What are you doing? \nCARTER Terry's name should be on this wall. \nClear is touched by the action. \nCARTER (CONT'D) So, why'd you want us to meet you here? Now? \nCLEAR They're watching me, see if I go to Alex. \nBILLY Are you? \nCLEAR They'll follow my car. (beat) That's why you're taking me. \nCARTER Why would I want to see him? \nClear eyes the two of them.

I'm gettin' a vision! You're the next one... BILLY (nervous) Hey, man, why'd you say that?! \nCARTER 'Cause if you say another word, I'm gonna fuckn' kill ya! \nBilly sits back, gesturing, \"hear ya.

BEACH - NIGHT \nCAMERA, FACING the ocean, moves along the shore revealing a lone image sitting on the beach, looking into the Atlantic. \nThe waves are small bur rhythmic, an enternal metronome. Numb, Alex Browning sits in the sand searching for an answer somewhere in the darkness of the evening sea. \nBehind him, O.S., approaching in the sand, SOFT FOOTSTEPS. He listens, notes them. Yet rather than turn around... he looks up into the sky. \nALEX'S POV - THE SKY \nThe shoreline lights cast an orange haze on the stars, breaking through, infinitely above. \nALEX (O.S.) Are they up there? \nWIDER \nClear Rivers approaches, barefoot in the sand. He neddn't turn to know who is behind him. \nALEX (CONT'D) Somehow... is 180 still in flight? Somewhere... are they still safe? \nClear hasn't met eyes with Alex, but she sits nearby, looking into the sky. CLEAR When I was a kid, like, six or seven... I used to worry so much about my parents dying. Like lying awake at night... just worrying. I loved them so much. I didn't want them to get hurt. And what would happen to me? What would life be like? (beat) Every night... it seemed. \nShe looks out at the stars. He doesn't eye her, either... \nALEX Most kids do, I guess. \nCLEAR Most kids never have it happen. \nAlex hangs his head... \nCLEAR When I was ten... my dad went into a 7-11 for cigerettes. I guess he heard somebody say \"Don't turn around.\" So on reflex, or thinkin' a friend was jokin'... he did. And the guy blew his head off. \nShe has lived this so many times, she is long beyond crying... \nCLEAR (CONT'D) And, let me tell ya, I had every reason to worry before... because life became shit. I don't blame her, I guess, but my mom couldn't deal with it at all. She married this asshole, who my mom with my real dad would cross the street to avoid this guy. He really didn't want a kid. And so my mom didn't either anymore, I guess. (beat) If that was the design for my father... and my family... then fuck Death, FUCK IT! \nThe waves continue to shore. Clear looks up at the sky. \nCLEAR (CONT'D) And so, anyway... I've thought of that \"somewhere,\" Alex. It exists, that place. \nHe looks at her. \nCLEAR (CONT'D) Where my dad is still safe. Where he had a full pack of cigerettes and kept driving. A place where me and my dad and my mom... are still together....and have no idea about this second life, here. (beat) A place where our friends are still in the sky... where everyone gets a second chance. \nShe looks at him... \nCLEAR (CONT'D) But that place might only exist in my heart. And maybe, now... yours. I haven't experienced too many second chances in my life. I haven't seen any. But because of all of this, I believe... because of you... I will get a second chance. Because of me, you will. With you in my life... that place, right now existing in our hearts, will spring out... and become a real part of this life. \nAlex looks within her, as a soft ocean breeze blows through Clear's hair. \nCLEAR And that is the only way we can beat Death... by making something special out of Life. \nHis eyes well with tears. Only as she looks at Alex does Clear become emotional... they move closer, and kiss, the desire for each other, to defy the events around them; darkness; the isolation... \nThey dive into a deep feverish kiss. Embracing, as if the tighter, the safer. She pulls him back down to the beach and lifts his shirt over his head. \nALEX This won't be safe. \nClear looks down the beach, checking for any sight of Billy and Carter. \nCLEAR Those guys are probably fifteen minutes away. \nALEX No.. I mean, I don't have anything on me. This won't be safe. \nCLEAR (sadly) Nothing is... anymore. \nAlex looks to Clear, then kisses her with passion that reflects the defiance of death. He pulls open her shirt and falls into her arms.

After Lewton's, they'll be after me. \nCLEAR We're takin' you to a cabin in the woods, it's only a couple miles from my house. (to Carter) Keep off the highways, they'll be lookin' for us. \nCarter, however, continually glances into the rearview mirror, checking Alex. Finally, hotheaded and unable to withhold it any further... \nCARTER Alright, Browning, you fuckin' warlock... did you know about Ms. Lewton, or what? \nALEX Why do you think I was hiding? \nCLEAR Billy told the F.B.I. he saw you runnin' away from her house. \nALEX They blame me for everything. Her, Tod, the plane crash... \nBILLY Your shoe prints were in the blood. Your fingerprints on the knives... \nALEX I already told you... \nCARTER (interrupting) I'm not talkin' about if you did it.

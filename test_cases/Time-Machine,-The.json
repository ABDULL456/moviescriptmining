He looks up and nods. \nDR. HILLYER Now you're being sensible.  I'll take care of it first thing in the New Year. \nBACK TO GROUP SHOT                                     34 \nEveryone rises. \nDR.

Enormously. \nTIME TRAVELLER I'm sorry. \nFILBY (looks up to him directly) Will you answer me one question honestly? \nTIME TRAVELLER I'll try. \nFILBY Why this preoccupation with Time? \nTIME TRAVELLER (sharply) Why not? \nFILBY Don't go simple on me, George! \nTIME TRAVELLER (a beat, then calmly) If you want to know the truth, I don't much care for the time I was born into. - It seems people aren't dying fast enough these days.  They call upon science to invent new, more efficient weapons to depopulate the earth. \nFILBY I quite agree with you.  But here we are and we have to make the best of it. \nTIME TRAVELLER You may have to.  I don't. \nFILBY (making a half- hearted attempt at levity) All right.  Take a journey on your contraption.

All of the little people seem to be of the Girl's age or younger. \nTIME TRAVELLER Doesn't anyone age in this land of yours? \nThe Girl makes no reply.  Instead she gazes off at the sun which is low in the heavens.  Shadows have already fallen over the distant hills. \nTIME TRAVELLER What's your name? \nTHE GIRL Weena. \nTIME TRAVELLER How do you spell that? \nWEENA Spell? \nTIME TRAVELLER Write!  - Can't you write?

The people of the future are sitting on cushions around the tables, having their evening meal.

No one pays attention to Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the b.g. \nAT THE MAIN TABLE - MED. SHOT                          190 \nA score of attractive young men and young women are enjoying their dinner.  There is a general atmos- phere of bubbling good humor.  They don't even look up as Weena and the Time Traveller sit down at the table.  She hands him an orange-sized raspberry.  He takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White who sit across the table from him and tries to engage them in conversation. \nTIME TRAVELLER (directed to Young Man, but meant for the entire group) I don't mind telling you, I'm quite hungry.  I've come a long, long way. \nLooks around for some kind of a reaction.  There is none. \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                191 \nHe bites into the fruit.  It's good.

Perhaps even courtesy has died, but I have come a long way and there are things I would like to know. \nYOUNG MAN (considers a moment, then) Why? \nTIME TRAVELLER Because I shall return to my time and they will ask questions such as what kind of government rules your world. \nMAN IN WHITE We have no government. \nTIME TRAVELLER (speaking as though to a child) You must have a body of men who pass and enforce laws. \nMAN IN WHITE There are no laws. \nTIME TRAVELLER (taken aback, then) How do you get your food and clothing? \nThe Man in White looks at the Young Man beside him. They both shrug their shoulders. \nTIME TRAVELLER Doesn't anyone work? \nMAN IN WHITE No. \nTIME TRAVELLER (picks up fruit) Then where does this come from? \nMAN IN WHITE It grows.  It always grows. \nTIME TRAVELLER But it must be planted, cultivated, nurtured...unless...

Am I right? \nMAN IN WHITE You ask many questions. \nTIME TRAVELLER (annoyed) Yes!  And I'm not ashamed of it. That is how man has learned and bettered himself.

He reaches the wall and seizes an ancient curtain which covers it.  A cloud of dust rises as he tugs it aside and the curtain falls, almost crumbling.  Shelves and shelves of books are disclosed.  The books are old even though many of them have futuristic de- signs.  The bindings of once proud volumes hang in brown tatters.  The Time Traveller steps to the books. \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                194 \nThe realization of the true state of affairs shows on his face.  He is appalled.  Carefully he pulls a volume from the shelf.  Its binding breaks as he opens it and, when his hand touches the pages, they crumple like ashes and drift to the floor. He drops the book.  His voice is a shocked WHISPER. \nTIME TRAVELLER Yes...they do tell me all about you! \nWith sudden violence he slams his fist into a whole shelf of books.  His hand plows through them and the dust swirls into the air.  He turns back in anger. \nTIME TRAVELLER What have you done?  Thousands of years of building and rebuilding creating and re-creating so that you can let it crumble to dust. \nWith one hand he grabs the Young Man and shakes him. \nTIME TRAVELLER A million yesterdays of sensitive men dying for their dreams.  For what?  So you can swim and dance and play. \nHe releases him and leaves. \nTHE HALL - MOVING SHOT                                 195 \nThe Time Traveller stomps among the Eloi, hating them for their dissipation. \nWithout emotion they watch him walk toward the entrance.

The Young Man first, then the rest of the Eloi grasp the idea.  They also light branches from the torch and dash for the various wells to duplicate the Time Traveller's action. \nVARIOUS SHOTS OF ELOI                                  360-362 \nCarrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of wells and dumping the fire below. \nTWO SHOT                                               363 \nWith Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on with approval at the Eloi's work. \nEXT.

It does not explode into the air.  Rather, the solid earth seems to give way so that the entire surface of the ground begins to fall into the subterranean chambers. \nANOTHER ANGLE - (MINIATURE)                            371 \nA section of the earth sheers away and falls in an ever widening rift. \nA WELL - (MINIATURE)                                   372 \nAs it is swallowed by the earth, followed by a belch of steam. \nBACK TO LANDSCAPE - (MINIATURE)                        373 \nLeveled off by the earthquake.

The Time Traveller, wearing his velvet jacket, relaxes on the white sand, playing with the blossom Weena gave him earlier that day, and WHISTLING \"The Land Of The Leal\". \nWeena sits on a large rock nearby at the edge of the pool, washing the soot from her face and hands. She glances over to the Time Traveller. \nWEENA Are you sorry? \nHe STOPS WHISTLING, but the MUSIC CONTINUES. He turns. \nTIME TRAVELLER Sorry? - Sorry for what? \nWEENA That you have to stay. \nTIME TRAVELLER (gazing into the night) Yes. - I am sorry because I could tell so much to the people of my own time... I could tell them about the happiness and sorrow the future has in store for them.  They could learn from it...or would they? \nWEENA You don't want to stay, do you? \nTIME TRAVELLER It isn't that, but I don't fit here anymore than you would in my time. \nWEENA (a pause, and then) I would like to see your time. \nTIME TRAVELLER No, Girl, you wouldn't be very happy there. \nWEENA Do you have someone like me - there? \nTIME TRAVELLER No.  No one like you.

(teasing) There is a woman too, of course! (noticing her disappointment, he relents) She looks after my house for me. She is sixty-two years old. - Much older than you are. \nWeena, relieved, starts to comb her wet hair into a new arrangement. \nWEENA (suddenly) How do they wear their hair? \nTIME TRAVELLER Who? \nWEENA The women in your time. \nTIME TRAVELLER (after a thought) Up! \nWEENA Up? - How? \nTIME TRAVELLER (with awkward gesture) Like this. \nWEENA Show me. \nThe Time Traveller puts the flower back into his pocket, gets up and walks over to Weena. \n", "test3_id": 1418}

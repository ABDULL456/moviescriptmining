{"train": "MRS. WATCHETT Dinner is served, gentlemen! \nBRIDEWELL (puts his glass down) First sensible thing I've heard all evening. \nHe rises and starts for the dining room.  The others follow. \nFILBY, HILLYER & KEMP - MOVING SHOT                    8 \nAs they walk toward the DINING ROOM. \nFILBY This is peculiar.  He is usually very prompt, precise and punctual. \nDR. HILLYER He's making fools of us by inviting us here and then not showing up. It's not the behavior of a gentleman. \nKEMP To say nothing of the waste of time. \nDR. HILLYER (agreeing) To say nothing of the waste of time. \nBridewell, already seated at the heavily laden dining table, pours a glass of wine for himself while the others settle down.  This time the chair at the head of the table is conspicuously unoccupied. \nBRIDWELL (arises, lifting his glass) One thing I will say for George, he keeps the best cellar in the south of England...and Mrs. Watchett is the finest cook in the world. - I think I'll drink to that! \nThe glass barely touches his lips as he freezes at the SOUND OF DROPPING TRAYS and a PIERCING SCREAM. All look in the direction of another door across the room. \nTHE DOOR - FULL SHOT                                   9 \nIt bursts inward and Mrs. Watchett, her hair flying, dashes down the steps panic-stricken into the room. The CAMERA RUSHES with her to the table where the men have come to their feet.  Clutching Filby's arm, she points toward the long corridor now revealed by the open door. \nMRS. WATCHETT (frightened) There!...there... \nAll stare o.s., Hillyer with the carving knife clasped in his hand. \nCORRIDOR THROUGH DOORWAY - FULL SHOT                   10 \nWe see the figure of a man approaching, a black silhouette against the pale glow at the end of the passage.  He is bent with exhaustion and sways as he moves forward, limping.  The man comes closer, his features still blacked out by shadows, but as he nears the doorway, the light from the room strikes first his legs, then his body and finally his face.  Here he stops. \nThis is our first meeting with the TIME TRAVELLER (for so it will be convenient to speak of him).  At this instant he is in a sorry state.  His clothing is tattered and dirty, his face pale, bruised and scratched and his eyes glazed with fatigue.  For a moment he hesitates as if dazzled by the light and then takes another swaying step into the room. \nFILBY AND BRIDEWELL - MOVING SHOT                      11 \nThey come to life.  Bridewell, noticing the glass of wine still in his hand, quickly gulps it down before rushing with Filby toward the Time Traveller. \nFILBY Good lord! - What's happened? \nReaching him, each seizes an elbow to support him. Bridewell throws a frantic glance at Dr. Hillyer back at the table.  The Time Traveller, however, moves forward under his own power. \nTIME TRAVELLER I'm all right...just some food...a drink... \nHe reaches the table and sinks into his chair.  With trembling hands Bridewell tries to pour him a glass of wine, spilling most of it over the tablecloth. The Time Traveller looks up at him with a wry smile. \nTIME TRAVELLER Are you all right? \nA stunned Bridewell is unable to speak while the Time Traveller empties his glass. \nBRIDEWELL (a delayed answer) Of course.  I'm...all right... \nMeanwhile, Mrs. Watchett hovers over the Time Traveller like a mother hen. \nMRS. WATCHETT (half apology, half concern) I didn't recognize you!...it was so dark... \nThe CAMERA MOVES IN as she dishes up a bowl of soup for him, but he pushes it away. \nTIME TRAVELLER Meat...I'm hungry for meat! \nMrs. Watchett grasps the carving knife from Dr. Hillyer and, with a single slash, cuts off a huge portion of beef and loads it onto his plate. \nGROUPSHOT                                              12 \nThe Time Traveller eats, the men watching him curiously.  Finally Dr. Hillyer leans forward. \nThere is no response. \nBRIDEWELL (chuckling) I say, George.  Suppose you go off and get lost in the fiftieth century! How will you find your way back? \nTIME TRAVELLER (quite serious) That's a calculated risk I'm prepared to take. \nDr. Hillyer, having controlled his fury, now exchanges significant glances with Kemp and turns back with an air of reasonableness. \nDR. HILLYER Now listen, George!  I don't know what you take us for, but we're not fools.  There are a number of ways of doing a disappearing trick!  But a man of your ability should not bother with such nonsense. \nCLOSE ON DR. HILLIER - MOVING SHOT                     33 \nHe gets up from his chair. \nDR. HILLYER (unable to resist the temptation for sarcasm) There's a war on, you know!  The Boers are putting up a pretty stiff fight in South Africa and our country needs inventors like you. I can put you in touch with the War Office if you wish. \nHe walks over to the Time Traveller who is sitting near the table on which stands the empty Ebony Box with its lid open.  Filby is in the b.g. \nTIME TRAVELLER (looks up at Filby) What do you think? \nFILBY (hesitating slightly, and then) I think Dr. Hillyer has a point, George. \nLazily the Time Traveller toys with the lid of the Ebony Box, then closes it with a SNAP.  He looks up and nods. \nDR. HILLYER Now you're being sensible.  I'll take care of it first thing in the New Year. \nBACK TO GROUP SHOT                                     34 \nEveryone rises. \nDR. HILLYER Well, time to go. \nKEMP Yes, we all have our plans for tonight. \nDr. Hillyer and Kemp head toward the door.  Bridewell lingers at the table where the model of the Time Machine disappeared. \nBRIDEWELL (concerned) Are you all right, George? \nTIME TRAVELLER Of course, I am. \nDR. HILLYER'S VOICE Coming, Bridewell? \nReluctantly Bridewell leaves the library followed by the Time Traveller. \nINT. ENTRANCE HALL - FULL SHOT                         35 \nWhile his guests put on their capes, overcoats, scarfs, gloves and hats, preparing for the cold weather outside, the Time Traveller steps to the door and grasps the handle. \nTIME TRAVELLER Thanks for coming. \nHe opens the door and they file past him, Bridewell at the rear. \nAD LIBS Happy New Year. - Goodbye, George - Happy Twentieth Century. - Etc. \nBridewell clasps the Time Traveller's shoulder, reassuringly. \nEXT. COTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (DUSK) - (MATTE)            36 \nIn contrast to the previous SHOT (Sc.l) this is a snow- less wintery day.  The visitors are boarding the carriage that awaits them in the drive. \nDR. HILLYER Come on, Bridewell. \nBridewell glances back to the Time Traveller, then submits and, with a CRACK OF A WHIP, the carriage moves off. \nEXT. ENTRANCE - FULL SHOT                              37 \nThe Time Traveller, a silhouette framed in the door- way, waves to them. \nTHE CARRIAGE                                           38 \nFILBY I saw a toy machine vanish.  But I'm certain there are a number of ways of doing that trick.  Any magician at the Hippodrome could probably do it. \nTIME TRAVELLER (angrily) It was no trick! - Would you care to see the full-scale model? \nFILBY No, I would not!  I have no desire to tempt the laws of Providence and I don't think you should.  It's not for man to trifle with. \nTIME TRAVELLER Now you sound like Hillyer and Kemp. \nFILBY There is something in their common sense attitude to life. (and then) George, I speak to you as a friend. More, as a brother.  If that machine can do what you say it can...destroy it.  Destroy it, George, before it destroys you. \nDistant SOUNDS of NEW YEAR'S CELEBRATIONS are HEARD. \nTIME TRAVELLER You must have plans for New Year's Eve.  Don't let me keep you. \nFILBY Mary isn't well.  We decided to stay home with the baby.  But why don't you come home with me.  You haven't seen little Jaime for a long time. \nTIME TRAVELLER I can't. \nFILBY What's stopping you? \nTIME TRAVELLER I just want to see the old century out by myself. \nFILBY (rising) Have it your own way. \nHe goes to the door. \nAT THE DOOR                                            60 \nFilby stops, then turns around. \nFILBY Will you promise me that you won't leave the house tonight? \nTIME TRAVELLER I promise you, I won't walk out of the door. \nFilby, a little puzzled by this strange promise, turns to go as the Time Traveller puts down the poker and steps up to him. \nTIME TRAVELLER David!  Please don't think me un- friendly! - Come over to dinner - next Friday.  Won't you? \nFILBY Very well. \nTIME TRAVELLER Fine...and will you bring the others with you? \nFILBY (with a warm smile) Whatever you say, George. - Happy New Year. \nTIME TRAVELLER (shaking hands) And a very happy New Year to you, David. \nFilby pats his arm before he leaves.  The Time Traveller stands there until he hears the FRONT DOOR SHUT.  Then, FOLLOWED BY THE CAMERA, he goes to the writing table and sits down. \nAT THE WRITING TABLE                                   61 \nThe Time Traveller opens a drawer and takes out the new calendar that reads:  \"1900, Welcome New Century.\" He flips a few pages to find the next Friday and jots down the dinner engagement.  At this point Mrs. Watchett, with his velvet smoking jacket over her arm, appears in the doorway and walks up to him. \nMRS. WATCHETT Will you be having supper in this evening, sir? \nTIME TRAVELLER (while ex- changing jackets with Mrs. Watchett's help) I don't think so, Mrs. Watchett.  Why don't you take the evening off and celebrate. \nMRS. WATCHETT Thank you, sir, but if you won't be needing me I think I'll turn in early and get some sleep... (indicating revelers outside) ...it I can. - Goodnight, sir. \nTIME TRAVELLER Goodnight. \nShe turns to go as the Time Traveller calls after her. \nTIME TRAVELLER Oh, Mrs. Watchett! (as she responds) I've invited Mr. Filby and the others to dinner next Friday. (and then) Happy New Year, Mrs. Watchett. \nMRS. WATCHETT Happy New Year, sir. \nMrs. Watchett exits, closing the door after her.  Once again the Time Traveller is alone.  He looks at the old calendar that reads:  \"December 3l. 1899,\" rips the final sheet from the pad, crumples it into a tight little ball and tosses it into the hearth where it burns.  With slow and deliberate movements he replaces the old calendar with the new one.  Then, he hastily scribbles a note which he puts into an envelope and places it prominently on the table.  He rises and mounts the steps that lead to: \nINT. CORRIDOR - MOVING SHOT                            62 \nTIME TRAVELLER IN THE MACHINE - MED. SHOT              74 \nThe rays of the early Morning sun slide down the lab- oratory wall and sweep across the Time Traveller and his Machine.  A trace of a smile -- and then, he looks up and squints. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE It was disconcerting to see the sun... \nINSERT:  SKYLIGHT - MED. SHOT - (STOP MOTION OR        75 ANIMATION) \nAs the sun arches majestically. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE ...arc in less than a minute... \nINSERT:  POT OF FLOWERS - (STOCK AND/OR STOP MOTION)   76 \nAs they close. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE ....to see flowers closing their eyes for the night, changes that normally took hours, occuring in seconds, was beautiful. \nDuring this it has turned into night and a little SNAIL rushes across the ground beneath the plant, and then the flowers start to open again.  Light begins to flood the scene. \nIn the b.g. Mrs. Watchett leaps into the garden, pauses the briefest instant to sprinkle the flowers, then with the speed of wind streaks away. \nBACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 77 \nA trace of a smile, then apprehension. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE And as yet I was travelling very slowly! (challenging) What if I went faster?! \nHis hand shoves the lever farther over toward the future position. \nTHE HUMMING SOUND RISES TO HIGHER PITCH.  The Time Traveller lurches in his seat, clings to the controls and looks at the dials. \nINSERT:  CLOSE ON DIALS                                78 \nThey are spinning. \nBACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 79 \nAs he looks up. \nINSERT OF SKYLIGHT - (STOP MOTION OR ANIMATION)        80 \nThe sun soars across the sky, night falls.  Pin points of stars streak by and dawn comes.  The sun is chased by the stars again and again.  Faster and faster. \nVERY CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                           81 \nHis eyes gleam with a mad light, half pleasure, half pain.  His face is illuminated by the alternating flashes of light, each one indicating the passage of another day. \nHe turns toward the: \nWINDOW - FULL SHOT - (ANIMATION, STOP MOTION & STOCK)  82 \nWithout a trace of frost or icicles.  The snow has disappeared, replaced by the lush green of Spring. While the vines of a morning Glory grow up and around the window like a snake and the flowers open and close, we see the following through repeated fast flashes. \nThe sun hops swiftly across the sky.    (a) \nThe night falls and the stars circle    (b) the North Star. \nThe sun appears and disappears be-      (c) hind the whirling clouds. \nAt night the moon races through         (d) tumultuous clouds. \nOn the following day the sky darkens    (e) with thunderheads.  There is a cataract of lightning and THUNDER. \nBACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 83 \nQuick flashes of lightning on the Time Traveller's face followed by a series of SHORT THUNDERCLAPS. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE It became intoxicating.  To see an entire storm in a few seconds. - So I pushed the lever on toward even greater speed. \nFILBY (smiles as he interrupts) I'm afraid you have me confused with my father, sir.  There was a remarkable resemblance. - I'm James Filby. \nTIME TRAVELLER Was? \nJAMES FILBY Were you a friend of father's? \nTIME TRAVELLER Yes...yes...I've been away. \nJAMES FILBY He was killed in the war...a year ago. \nTIME TRAVELLER (aghast) No!...it can't be... (then, as he realizes its truth) I'm sorry to hear that. (pause, then hesitantly points) And the gentleman who used to live across the street? \nJAMES FILBY Oh, him.  Some inventor who disappeared around the turn of the century. - If you're interested in that house, forget it.  You can't buy it or even go inside. \nTIME TRAVELLER Why is that? \nJAMES FILBY My father was executor of the inventor's estate and he refused to liquidate it. (adds with a smile) I often chided him on that account, but he felt positive that the owner would return some day. - Some people hereabouts think it's haunted. (stares at Time Traveller curiously, studying the strange cut of his clothes) Who are you, sir? \nTIME TRAVELLER Just a stranger who once knew your father. \nJAMES FILBY I see. (still curious at the Time Traveller's abstract attitude) Have you been at the front, sir? \nTIME TRAVELLER Front?  What front? \nJAMES FILBY Why the war, of course. \nTIME TRAVELLER What war? \nJAMES FILBY Great heavens, man, don't you know we've been at war with Germany since nineteen fourteen?  I thought perhaps you had seen action in France...or maybe... (noticing confusion, adds with a note of compassion) Perhaps a cup of tea would make you feel better.  Won't you come in? \nTIME TRAVELLER No...no, thank you. \nJAMES FILBY You're sure you're alright, sir? \nTIME TRAVELLER Yes, I'm quite alright. \nJAMES FILBY (hesitantly) Then...goodbye, sir. \nThe Time Traveller nods and James Filby slowly turns and, glancing back repeatedly, enters the Department Store. \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                97 \nHe speaks almost to himself. \nTIME TRAVELLER Goodbye, Jaime. \nWith the bitter taste of death for his old friend, David Filby, he slowly walks across the street and returns to the cottage. \nINT. LABORATORY - FULL SHOT                            98 \nThe Time Traveller approaches the Machine, steps up into the seat, throws his head back and grimly shoves the lever forward. \nSKYLIGHT - FULL SEOT - (STOCK AND ANIMATION)           99 \nACCENT on MUSIC, then as the HUMMING OF THE TIME MACHINE takes over, suddenly panes of GLASS BREAK one after another, giving a clear view of a sky full of SWIRLIING TURBULENT CLOUDS. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                100 \nThe FLICKERS of days and nights, as well as the HUMMING, INCREASES and DECREASES, in accordance with his manipulation of the controls.  Over this: \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE As I went along, I gained experience in handling the Machine.  I found that I could stop for a day, an hour, or even for a second to observe, then go ahead for a year or two. - Thus I was able to see the changing world in a series of glimpses. \nSomething catches his interest.  He pulls back the lever to SLOW DOWN. \nEXT. STREET - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT) - (STOP MOTION)      101 \nWith the speed of wind, pedestrians streak across the pavement.  The bright lights of the night pop out one after another leaving a sparingly illuminated street.  The HUMMING SUBSIDES.  The mannequin previously seen in the show window now wears the clothing of the \"Roaring Twenties\".  A distant CLOCK STRIKES ELEVEN. \nSmiling. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE It vas reassuring to find that she hadn't changed.  Only her costume. Provocative to say the least.  I wondered what she would look like ten years hence. \nWith a grin he throws the lever forward. \nINSERT OF DIALS                                        114 \nHUMMING INCREASES and the years spin; 1960, 1961 and so on until it finally STOPS on 1966. \nBACK AT THE MANNEQUIN                                  115 \nDressed in the sleek dress of the future.  First a distant, then a close AIR RAID SIREN HOWLS, menacingly. \nBACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 116 \nHis smile becomes a puzzled stare at what he sees. \nEXT. STREET IN 1966 - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                117 \nPeople are racing along the sidewalk.  The SOUND OF MORE DEEP-THROATED SIRENS from all directions comes over.  Drivers leave their cars of the period in disorder. \nThe running is purposive, however.  All are entering particular buildings or, like those closest to the Time Traveller, are descending a stairway from the sidewalk down below street level.  Some glance sky- ward. \nA LITTLE GIRL picks up the doll she has dropped as her FATHER returns from the shelter.  He gathers her up in his arms and rushes back to safety. \nIn a few seconds the streets are deserted. \nTIME MACHINE AT EDGE OF PARK - FULL SHOT               118 \nThe Time Traveller gets out and looks around, confused. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE At first I wondered if my Machine and I were the cause of the panic.  I was to soon find out we weren't. \nHe starts off toward the sidewalk, the CAMERA MOVING with him.  At the descending subway stair- way he stops and peers downward, but sees no one below.  Meanwhile, through a loudspeaker o.s., a melodious SYMPHONY ORCHESTRA is heard softly, until a BURST OF CHORDS attracts the Time Traveller's attention. \nEXT. STORE WINDOW - FULL SHOT                          119 \nA TELEVISION CABINET on display.  The set is operating, showing a huge symphony orchestra led by one of the popular conductors of tomorrow. The CAMERA SWINGS to the modern ENTRANCE of FILBY'S DEPARTMENT STORE just as the Time Traveller reaches the two broad glass doors.  As he steps forward he intercepts the rays of electronic eyes and the doors fly wide open. \nHe stops startled, looking about to see who opened them.  Seeing no one, he starts slowly forward. \nINT. DEPARTMENT STORE - LONG SHOT                      120 \nFrom the TV set BLARES MUSIC that gradually becomes the UNDERSCORE for the SCENE.  The Time Traveller enters and turns his attention to other products of tomorrow -- refrigerators, vacuum cleaners, reducing belts, etc.  As his keen mind grasps the significance of each, he smiles with approval, proud of his fellow man.  His delight increases until he is interrupted by APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS.  He looks off. \nREVERSE SHOT                                           121 \nComing from the office is THE WARDEN, dressed in a plastic suit.  He also wears an armband and a white crash helmet, both bearing the insignia of \"Civilian Defense.\"  MUMBLES are heard from beneath his mask as the CAMERA PANS him to the Time Traveller. \nTIME TRAVELLER (shakes his head) I can't understand you. \nThe warden takes off his helmet.  He is David Filby's son, James, whom we saw in 1917 as a young man.  He is now in his mid-sixties. \nWARDEN (looking at helmet) Confounded radio in this thing. Makes more noise than it does sense. \nTIME TRAVELLER (recognizing him) Filby! \nWARDEN My name is Mister Filby. - Didn't you hear the air raid siren? \nTIME TRAVELLER You mean that horrible screeching? \nWARDEN It wasn't constructed for its aesthetic values, you know, but to warn silly young fools like yourself to get down into the shelter.  Now go on. \nTIME TRAVELLER But I'm perfectly comfortable and I find your store magnificent.  What splendid achievements, what gigantic strides mankind has taken, what... \nWARDEN (interrupting) Come on, young man.  We'd better be going before the mushrooms start sprouting. (looks at Time Traveller with renewed interest) You do look familiar.  Haven't we met somewhere before? \nTIME TRAVELLER Indeed we have.  Right here.  Many years ago. \nTHE TIME MACHINE - LONG SHOT - (STOCK) - (PROCESS)     131 \nOut of the tumult a flow of red hot lava turns aside and leaps directly toward the Time Machine. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE Then I saw my own danger.  I too was to be engulfed! \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                132 \nAs he sees his great peril. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE But to go back was unthinkable. \nHe jams the lever forward to its furthest position. The HUMMING SOARS TO A VERY HIGH PITCH. \nTHE ENCROACHING LAVA - (STOCK)                         133 \nIt has been approaching with the speed of a torrent, but now it literally leaps forward in a blinding red haze that engulfs the entire scene. \nTHE TIME MACHINE - MED. SHOT                           134 \nThe interior of the Machine is permeated with a dull red glow which seems to flow like mist all about the Time Traveller. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE Only my speed through time saved me from being roasted alive and encased in stone forever. \nINSERT OF DIALS                                        135 \nThey are spinning too fast to distinguish anything in the gradually fading red glow. \nEXTREME CLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                        136 \nHis face is bathed in sweat.  His eyes search the growing darkness. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE The molten rock cooled. (he closes his burning eyes as the last of the light vanishes) I prayed...wondering how many centuries, how many eons must pass before the wind and rain could wear away the mountain that enclosed me. \nIn the pitch darkness there are only the sounds of the HUMMING TIME MACHINE and the SLOW LABORED BREATHING of the Time Traveller. \nThen a match flickers.  The CAMERA SCARES BACK.  The Time Traveller holds up a burning matchstick, his face glistening with perspiration as he leans forward to look at the dials. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (whispering) Darkness...darkness for centuries. \nINSERT OF DIALS                                        137 \nThey roll very fast.  We can distinguish only the passing of years -- 70,000...80,000...90,000... 100,000.  Then the matchlight flickers and goes out leaving only the dial's own faint glow. \nBACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 138 \nOnce again there is darkness and the MONOTONOUS HUM of the Time Machine.  He breathes heavily and tries to calm himself. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE I wondered if there was still war being waged on the ground above me... if man would still exist on earth, when I saw the sun again. \nAs he speaks, the Time Machine goes faster and faster. HIGH PITCHED HUMMING INCREASES. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE The centuries rolled by. - I put my trust in time and waited for the rock to wear down around me. \nA white light from above begins to permeate the dark- ness.  The Time Traveller looks up, his face showing immense relief. \nWHAT HE SEES - (ANIMATION)                             139 \nRocks deteriorate and a bright blue sky bursts into view.  ACCENT ON MUSIC. \nEXT. TIME MACHINE AND GROUND NEARBY - LONG SHOT        140 (SPLIT, ANIMATION) \nEverything is a blur except the Time Machine with its passenger.  The black rock on the surface slowly melts away and the flickering sunlight returns.  The Machine is now finally entirely above ground, the only distinct object in the whirling transparent landscape. \nEXT. TIME TRAVELLER - CLOSE SHOT                       141 \nAs he smiles gratefully up at the sky. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE I was free again! \nHis FOOTSTEPS ECHO through the great hall as the Time Traveller crosses to: \nA TABLE - MED. SHOT                                    155 \nThe Time Traveller glances down at the spread of exotic fruit.  Everything looks fresh and clean as though newly prepared.  Yet there is no indication of life or sound, either human or animal.  The air hangs in a deathlike stillness.  Slowly the Time Traveller turns and looks around the walls, his eyes searching, scrutinizing for some clue to this strange place.  There is none. \nThen he picks up an empty marble plate and POUNDS with it on the top of the table. \nTIME TRAVELLER (shouting) Anyone here? \nBut an ECHO is his only answer.  Curiously he re- traces his steps and leaves the great hall. \nEXT. LANDSCAPE - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                     156 \nPick up the Time Traveller as he walks slowly along. Every sense he possesses is on the alert.  His eyes probe every bush and tree and object that could possibly conceal some person or thing. \nSERIES OF SHOTS                                        157-161 \nAs the Time Traveller takes this long, slow walk, INTERCUT INSERTS of the various innocent objects he looks at with CLOSEUPS of Time Traveller as he reacts to the bewildering SILENCE and lack of life or movement. \nThe continued stretch of emptiness builds up a wave of apprehension in the Time Traveller which grows as he moves along.  The apprehension mounts into tension and gradually but inevitably approaches the state of horror that a human being would experience in a strange place where he had just come from an innocent freshly set table of ripe fruits and stepped outside into a beautiful but weird vacuum. \nEXT. WOODED AREA - LONG SHOT                           162 \nAs the Time Traveller reaches the edge of the trees, he hesitates, then moves into the forest. \nSERIES OF SHOTS                                        163-166 \nThe trees are thick and deep shadows cut patches of darkness through the bright sunlight which struggles to penetrate the maze.  The Time Traveller walks with continued wariness through the trees, glancing from left to right and occasionally stopping dead still and quickly darting a glance behind him at what he imagines to be some sound of movement. But all this is imaginary on his part.  There is nothing that moves or makes a sound in this forest. \nSuddenly he stops as he distinctly hears a familar and quite HUMAN combination of NOISES.  The SOUND SPLASHING WATER and LAUGHTER.  He hurries to some dense foliage where he stops to cautiously peer out. \nEXT. THE POOL - LONG SHOT - (DAY)                      167 \nThe Time Traveller's VIEW is partially obscured by the leaves.  At considerable distance upstream, the PEOPLE OF THE FUTURE are swimming in a natural pool and sunning themselves on a beach of white sand. They are small, but delicately formed.  Their grace and beauty fits perfectly into this splendid new world.  The spot is also extremely lovely, surrounded by fern trees, and with the water plunging into it from a high waterfall.  Below the pool the stream emerges in a swift torrent. \nANOTHER, CLOSER SHOT                                   168 \nA beautiful GIRL, dressed in a silken robe of white and gold, starts running.  As she runs, she loosens her robe which drifts to the sand and she dives deep into the crystal water. \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                169 \nHe smiles philosophically and leans back against a tree trunk, watching the distant swimmers, reassured. \nTIME TRAVELLER (musingly, to himself) So this is man's future... \nGROUP SHOT                                             170 \nThe people, apparently without any cares of the world, play, romp and swim. \nTIME TRAVELLER (o.s.) ...to bask in the sunlight, bathe in the clear streams and eat the fruits of earth with all knowledge of work and hardship forgotten. \nBACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 171 \nHe pauses, thinking back on what he has just said. \nTIME TRAVELLER Well, and why not? \nSuddenly a SHRILL SCREAM COMES OVER from the pool. He turns. \nTHE POOL - LONG SHOT                                   172 \nThe Girl has swum out too far and is caught by the swift torrent.  She CRIES OUT PITEOUSLY. \nThe other people turn their heads toward her, but make no move to help. \nCLOSE ON GIRL                                          173 \nShe has caught a ledge of rock and clings.  Two little men, their bare feet dangling in the water, sit nearby but ignore the Girl's plight. \nTIME TRAVELLER (smiles) Perhaps you'd better take me to someone a bit older I can talk to. \nTHE GIRL There is no one older. \nThe Time Traveller is suddenly struck by the truth of her words.  All of the little people seem to be of the Girl's age or younger. \nTIME TRAVELLER Doesn't anyone age in this land of yours? \nThe Girl makes no reply.  Instead she gazes off at the sun which is low in the heavens.  Shadows have already fallen over the distant hills. \nTIME TRAVELLER What's your name? \nTHE GIRL Weena. \nTIME TRAVELLER How do you spell that? \nWEENA Spell? \nTIME TRAVELLER Write!  - Can't you write?  Look! \nHe bends over, picks up a stick and starts to draw on the ground. \nINSERT: DUST                                           185 \nAs the stick writes out: \" W E E N A \" \nBACK TO SCENE                                          186 \nShe shows little interest. \nTIME TRAVELLER And what are your people called? \nWEENA (as if he ought to know) Eloi. \nINSERT OF DUST                                         187 \nThe stick now writes in the dust: \" E L O I \" \nBACK TO SCENE                                          188 \nA shadow crosses her face.  Suddenly she springs to her feet, concerned. \nWEENA Come.  We must go in. \nTIME TRAVELLER (rising) Why?  What's wrong? \nWEENA (anxiously) It is getting dark. \nShe grabs his hand and pulls him toward: \nINT. THE GREAT HALL - LONG SHOT - (MATTE?) - (DAY)     189 \nCrowded now.  The people of the future are sitting on cushions around the tables, having their evening meal.  The glowing orange light of the setting sun pierces the broken windows, lending a curious at- mosphere to the place.  No one pays attention to Weena or to the Time Traveller as they enter in the b.g. \nAT THE MAIN TABLE - MED. SHOT                          190 \nA score of attractive young men and young women are enjoying their dinner.  There is a general atmos- phere of bubbling good humor.  They don't even look up as Weena and the Time Traveller sit down at the table.  She hands him an orange-sized raspberry.  He takes it, looks at the Young Man and the Man in White who sit across the table from him and tries to engage them in conversation. \nTIME TRAVELLER (directed to Young Man, but meant for the entire group) I don't mind telling you, I'm quite hungry.  I've come a long, long way. \nLooks around for some kind of a reaction.  There is none. \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                191 \nHe bites into the fruit.  It's good.  While he is eating he searches for another way to bring up the subject. \nTIME TRAVELLER In my time a berry this size would have made news in every civilized country. \nGROUP SHOT                                             192 \nTIME TRAVELLER (picks up dry branches) As a matter of fact, I'm from right here. (gesturing) There's where my house stood many thousands of years ago.  Here - to that monument, was my laboratory. About there was my library where I once sat talking with friends about my Time Machine. \nMeanwhile, Weena has seated herself near the bushes in the f.g. \nCLOSE ON WEENA                                         218 \nShe watches every move he makes. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE (continuing) I hoped to learn a great deal.  I hoped to take back the knowledge, the advancement, mankind made... instead what do I find?  Vegetables! \nMeanwhile a pair of pale, hairy hands rise slowly from behind her. \nTIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             219 \nWith his back turned, he is piling up the sticks. \nTIME TRAVELLER (continuing) The human race reduced to living vegetables! \nBACK TO WEENA                                          220 \nThe hairy hands grab her shoulders.  The fear paralyzes her.  She is unable to scream. \nBACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 221 \nHe is about to light a match, but finds he needs more wood.  Without turning he calls back to Weena. \nTIME TRAVELLER Get me a few more twigs. \nWhen there is no answer he turns and looks. \nAT THE BUSHES                                          222 \nWeena is gone.  The CAMERA ZIPS TO LEFT, then to RIGHT and finally STOPS on the limp legs of Weena slowly disappearing under the brush. \nTIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           223 \nWe hear the RUSTLING OF BRANCHES and quick DIMINISHING FOOTSTEPS as the CAMERA RUSHES with the Time Traveller toward the bush.  He helps Weena to her feet and draws her to the pile of dry branches. \nTIME TRAVELLER (after calming her) What was it? \nWEENA (low) Morlocks. \nTIME TRAVELLER (strikes match and holds it to twigs) This seems to keep them away. \nCLOSE ON WEENA                                         224 \nShe gazes into the fire, with fascination.  Slowly she raises her hand and reaches out to grasps the flame. \nTWO SHOT                                               225 \nThe Time Traveller grabs her hand.  It is almost too late.  She looks at her burned hand with more amazement than pain. \nTIME TRAVELLER (while examining her hand) What ever made you put your hand in the fire? \nWEENA I never saw it before. \nApparently no harm done, the Time Traveller releases her hand.  He shakes his head in amazement and sits down beside her. \nTIME TRAVELLER (after a long silence) Do you know that the first thing which separated man from the rest of the mammals was his knowledge of fire? (he looks at her) No, I suppose you don't. (pokes at fire) The next great stride came with the discovery of the wheel. (turns to her) Do you know what that is? (she shakes her head) I'm sorry I was angry with your people.  I had no right to be. No more than if I had visited the Island of Bali in my own time. You were safe inside your great house, yet you came out into the night to warn me.  The one characteristic which distinguished man from the animal kingdom was the spirit of self sacrifice.  You have that quality, Girl.  I'm sure all of your people have it.  All it requires is someone to reawaken it. I shall try if you'll let me.  Will you? \nWEENA I do not understand you, but I believe you. \nTIME TRAVELLER That's a good start. - Now try to tell me...who or what are the Morlocks? (Weena looks at him blankly) Are they people or animals? (her expression remains unchanged) What do you know about yourself?  The past?  Don't your people ever speak of the past? \nWEENA There is no past. \nTIME TRAVELLER Don't you ever wonder about the future? \nWEENA There is no future. \nDeserted, until Weena leads the Time Traveller past the tables toward the shelves of crumbling books that the Young Man had previously shown him. \nShe enters an archway and walks up a dark stone corridor.  He follows. \nINT. STONE CORRIDOR - MED. SHOT                        233 \nWeena leading the Time Traveller up the corridor where it veers sharply to the right.  They disappear around the corner. \nINT. GREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)        234 \nThe Time Traveller and Weena stop at the threshold of a huge museum-like room, all done in a greenish colored porcelain-like substance.  There are no windows, but the vaulted ceiling has a transparent dome where the sun's rays, changing with the course of day, illuminate the entire museum.  It is evidently a place that no one bothers to visit. \nTIME TRAVELLER & WEENA - MOVING SHOT                   235 \nTheir feet kick up small flurries of dust as they walk among exhibitions of a long bygone era still existent behind plastic.  Some of the cases are broken and their contents, exposed to the atmos- phere, have decayed, crumbled to dust.  We recognize objects and machines, some belonging to the early part of the twentieth century and still others take on the forms and shapes that the audience of today will recognize as contemporary.  Then they pass cabinets that hold objects of a time far beyond comprehension. \nWeena finally leads the Time Traveller to a broken case which contains several boxes of golden rings a few inches in diameter and one inch wide, lined with minutely spaced grooves.  He picks up the nearest box and examines its contents. \nTIME TRAVELLER (picking up a ring) Are these the talking rings? \nWEENA Yes. \nTIME TRAVELLER They speak? \nWEENA Yes. \nTIME TRAVELLER Of what? \nWEENA Things no one here understands. \nTIME TRAVELLER How do you get it to talk? \nWeena takes the ring from the Time Traveller and lays it on a smooth topped porcelain block on its edge, like a coin, and spins it like a top. \nINSERT:  WHIRLING RING                                 236 \nA VOICE emerges from the spinning ring as the current of air flows through its grooves, much like a phono- graph needle evokes sound as it plays through the surface of one of our records. \nVOICE FROM RING Whomsoever chances upon these rings will probably hear the last recorded voice of civilized man.  This is the year four thousand eight hundred and twenty-nine. \nTWO SHOT                                               237 \nThe Time Traveller is listening in fascination and Weena in disinterested detachment. \nVOICE FROM RING (cont'd) The war between the East and West, which is now in its three hundredth and twenty-sixth year has at last come to an end.  There is nothing left to fight with and few of us left to fight.  The atmosphere has become so polluted with deadly germs that it can no longer be breathed.  There is no place on this planet that is immune.  The last surviving factory for the manufacture of oxygen has been destroyed.  Stockpiles are rapidly diminishing and when they are gone, we must die... \nThe last few WORDS DECREASE IN VOLUME and FADE AWAY. The Time Traveller eagerly reaches into the case for the second ring and spins it. \nANOTHER VOICE FROM RING This is the last day.  We, the last to survive, have had our final meeting. We have decided to split into two groups.  Each man and woman has made his own decision.  Some have chosen to take refuge in the great caverns and find a new way of life far down below the earth's surface.  The rest of us have decided to take our chances in the sunlight, small as those chances may be. \nThe VOICE from the ring DWINDLES and is heard no more.  The Time Traveller quickly picks up the third and last ring and spins it.  NO WORDS are heard -- only the SOUND of MARCHING FOOTSTEPS over floors of stone -- then a deadly SILENCE. \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                238 \nAs he watches the last ring spin to a standstill. Over this: \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE From the talking rings I learned how the human race divided itself and how the world of the Eloi and Morlocks began. \nHe turns. \nGREEN MUSEUM - LONG SHOT                               239 \nThe Time Traveller paces across the hall.  Weena hurries after him. \nTIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE By some quirk of fate the Morlocks had become the masters and the Eloi their servants.  The Morlocks main- tained them and bred them like cattle only to take them below when they reached maturity, which explained why there were no older people along them. \nThey exit. \nGREAT HALL - FULL SHOT                                 240 \nAs he looks ahead, then left and right, searching. \nVARIOUS GROUPS OF ELOI - (SPLIT?)                      253-254 \nIn the open country now, the forest behind them. In their colorful robes, the Eloi march slowly across the green landscape. \nAll are converging toward a single point somewhere ahead. \nWEENA AMONG ELOI                                       255 \nThey walk close together, paying no attention to one another, following the command of the MELANCHOLY STRAINS OF THE SIRENS. \nBACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 256 \nHis concern has turned to apprehension as he tries to grasp the meaning of what he observes. \nEXT. THE SIRENS ON THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY)      257 (MINIATURE) \nIt is the source of the sound.  There are little bursts of vapor from the tops of the sirens as they repeat their tones, like a fantastic pipe organ behind the Sphinx. \nTIME TRAVELLER AND ELOI                                258 \nAll of them walk in the same direction.  The Time Traveller looks this way and that, bewildered. But the Eloi disregard him and march straight ahead, eyes forward. \nThe Time Traveller breaks into a run. \nTWO SHOT                                               259 \nThe Time Traveller overtakes the Young Man, seizes his arm and jerks him to a halt.  Around them pass the shadows of the marching Eloi. \nTIME TRAVELLER What's happening?  Tell me! \nThe Young Man shows no emotion as he struggles to free himself.  His movements are almost mechanical. This unnerves the Time Traveller.  He stares at him, releasing his grip. \nThe moment the Young Man is free, he faces about and continues his march.  The Time Traveller re- mains motionless, watching him go.  The ECHOING SIRENS are now getting on his nerves. \nEXT. ENTRANCE TO THE GREAT BUILDING - LONG SHOT -      260 (DAY) \nThe Eloi pour out of the Great Hall, walking in a trance-like state. \nEXT. LANDSCAPE - EXTREME LONG SHOT - (DAY) - (SPLIT?)  261 \nFrom all directions the Eloi in their bright robes are moving, singly and in long files.  The impres- sion is one of vastness -- a feeling that mankind is marching to some unknown doom. \nTIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           262 \nHe spots a girl, rushes up, grabs her from behind. But it is not Weena.  Disappointed, he releases her, then goes on again, covering his ears with his palms, fighting to retain command of his own reason. \nSEVERAL SHOTS OF THE SIRENS - (MINIATURE)              263-265 \nAt various angles -- up, sideways, tilted.  The WAILING is DEAFENING. \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                266 \nHe still strives to control himself, moves forward, then pauses in amazement, looking straight ahead. \nEXT. THE SPHINX - FULL SHOT - (DAY) - (MATTE)          267 \nIt is toward the white sphinx that the Eloi have been marching.  But now the panel, upon which the Time Traveller had pounded so hard, is wide open, revealing a dark entrance into the pedestal. \nAnd despite their previous repugnance to the Sphinx, all of the people are now marching across the lawn resolutely to it. \nAT THE PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                            268 \nThe Young Man is the first to reach it.  He enters the wide opening and starts descending into sub- terranean darkness.  Others follow, Weena among them. \nTIME TRAVELLER (o.s.) Weena! \nWithout hearing him she passes through the entrance. \nHe runs off. \nSERIES OF SHOTS                                        278 \nThe Time Traveller running through the forest.         (a) \nHe is laboring up the open hillside.                   (b) \nThe Eloi in a semi-circle silently watch.  A few       (c) of them hesitantly start after the Time Traveller. \nEXT. THE WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                      279 \nArriving, the Time Traveller pauses to catch his breath, picks up a piece of wood that could serve as a torch, then jumps over the wall and starts to descend. \nOver this a faint THROBBING OF MACHINES can be heard. \nSHOOTING INTO SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                       280 \nThe Time Traveller climbs down, gripping the walls with his hands and feet.  The depth beneath him is dizzying.  THROBBING LOUDER. \nIN THE WELL - FULL SHOT                                281 \nAs the Time Traveller descends, the CAMERA FOLLOWS him, step after step.  The deeper he goes, the darker it becomes and the THROBBING OF MACHINES INCREASES as well. \nSuddenly a rock gives beneath his weight.  He barely saves himself.  Not without fear he pauses to rest, glancing upward. \nFROM THE THROAT OF WELL - LOW ANGLE                    282 \nA couple of the curious Eloi peer downward, watching the Time Traveller's progress. \nBACK TO TIME TRAVELLER                                 283 \nA metal ladder affixed to the wall brings him finally to the opening of a transverse passageway.  In almost complete darkness he steps from the ladder into the tunnel and pauses to take the piece of wood from his belt, but decides not to light it.  He bends and peers ahead. \nINT. GREAT CAVERN - FULL SHOT                          283X1 \nThe Time Traveller emerges onto the bridge in the b.g., pausing for a moment to survey the surroundings, then starts slowly down the staircase carved along the wall. The gloom is relieved only by puffing smoke and waver- ing lights, revealing occasionally vague shapes and grotesque shadows. \n(NOTE:  DRIPPING WATER from the walls and THROBBING OF MACHINES punctuate the desolation of this scene as well as the following sequence.) \nCLOSE ON T.T. - MOVING SHOT                            283X2 \nWalking, he notices an opening ahead and cautiously moves toward: \nINT. ENTRANCE TO FEASTING ROOM - FULL SHOT             283X3 \nAt the threshold of this dark, silent cell the T.T. pauses, then slowly enters.  Behind him, across the cavern, an indistinct figure watches, but quickly disappears as the T.T. strikes a match.  The sight that the T.T. beholds fills him with revulsion and horror. \nTHE FEASTING ROOM - T.T.'S P.O.V.                      283X4 \nThis is obviously a feasting place of the Morlocks. In the flickering light we see stone tables and scattered around the floor far below the unmistak- able remains of human bones after the flesh has been carnivorously picked away. \nT.T.'S VOICE So, this was the destiny of the Eloi. \nCLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X5 \nHis features twisted in horror in the flickering light of his match. \nT.T.'S VOICE (continuing) They were being bred like cattle by the Morlocks who had degenerated into the lowest form of human life...cannibalism. \nThe match dies between his fingers.  Suppressing a shudder, the T.T. turns and as he leaves this chamber of horror, the rock behind him comes to life.  A pale, spectral Morlock crosses the screen in the f.g. descending.  Another in the b.g. does likewise. \nMACHINES - FULL SHOT                                   283X6 \nMorlocks, their indistinct bodies obscene in their mockery of the human form, labor endlessly tending the needs of their machinery.  They look up toward the intruder as they HEAR his APPROACHING FOOTSTEPS, then hide. \nSTAIRWAY - MOVING SHOT                                 283X7 \nThe T.T. slowly descends the slender stone stairway that hugs the sheer wall.  Meanwhile at the base of the feasting room under the stairway on which the T.T. is moving a Morlock moves a curtain aside and reveals itself.  It silently watches as another Morlock appears at the top of the stairs and follows. \nT.T. - MED. SHOT                                       283X29 \nHe lights his last match and moves forward, looking for his lost torch. \nGROUPSHOT                                              283X30 \nThe T.T. leads the Eloi toward the stairway, the light of the match his only weapon in keeping the Morlocks away.  Finally he spots his torch and picks it up hurriedly. \nCLOSE ON T.T.                                          283X31 \nHis face streams with sweat and is taut with appre- hension while he applies the dying match to the intended torch. \nTIME TRAVELLER (muttering) Burn, will you! \nHe holds the match steady, but it burns lower and lower without starting the wood.  In despair he turns to Weena. \nTIME TRAVELLER Quick, something to burn!  It's my last match! \nBACK TO THE MORLOCKS                                   283X32 \nAs they are closing in. \nCLOSE ON WEENA                                         283X33 \nWith a fierce gesture she rips open the loose sleeve of her robe, tears off a piece of cloth and holds it out. \nBACK TO T.T.                                           283X34 \nAs match is about to die, he holds it beneath the cloth.  It flames up and he seizes it, dropping the dead match. \nHe holds the burning cloth beneath the wood and in this hotter flame it begins to burn.

Morlock swings at him.  He ducks and almost falls off ledge.  He grabs Morlock, and hangs on until he can scramble up on ledge again. He clutches at Morlock's throat, banging his head against the rock wall, finally throwing him off ledge.  At the same time another Mor- lock appears on ledge, while the Morlock he had previously kicked rises to menace him from the other side.  The Time Traveller jumps across cavern to ramp and starts down toward the floor, trying to get back to his torch, his only weapon against the Morlocks. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE TIME TRAVELLER                        351X7 \nHe pauses momentarily against Rock Wall.

The Young Man first, then the rest of the Eloi grasp the idea.  They also light branches from the torch and dash for the various wells to duplicate the Time Traveller's action. \nVARIOUS SHOTS OF ELOI                                  360-362 \nCarrying bundles of burning wood to the mouths of wells and dumping the fire below. \nTWO SHOT                                               363 \nWith Weena at his side, the Time Traveller gazes on with approval at the Eloi's work. \nEXT.

THE BLAZING FOREST - (SUNSET) - (STOCK)           367-368 \nThe sun on the horizon is a dim red ball through the smoke.  Several trees fall over, blazing.

She smiles, then with an impulsive move turns her face toward him. \nWEENA (innocently) Would I be pretty? \nThe gesture brings her eyes and lips close to his. He still holds her upswung hair and, as he gazes into her young eyes, he feels her warm breath on his cheek. \nTIME TRAVELLER (slowly) Yes...you would be.  More than pretty. (his voice sinks to a whisper) I wish we could go back together, Weena, back to my own time...or to times before that when the world was young.

The face is broken and the pedestal partly in shambles.  The panel is open. \nTIME TRAVELLER & WEENA                                 381 \nJoyfully he grabs her hand and, pulling her, breaks into a run. \nGROUP OF ELOI                                          382 \nThe Young Man steps forward, pointing o.s.  The Time Traveller and Weena run through the haze, then the Eloi follow them. \nEXT. THE WHITE SPHINX - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) -          383 (MATTE) \nThe face is broken in half.  It is left with only a half a smile and thin smoke drifts through the remaining eye.  The rest of the statue and the sirens are on the ground beside the partial ruins of the pedestal.  Beyond it the hill is gone and gray haze covers the once green world.  The Time Traveller and Weena come through the charred bushes onto the lawn.  Here they stop. \nTHE OPEN PANEL - THEIR P.O.V.                          384 \nThe Time Machine sits in the midst of the swirling smoke.

Weena follow, hesitantly, but the long habit compels her to halt before the threshold.  Unmindful of this, the Time Traveller enters. \nINT. PEDESTAL - LONG SHOT                              386 \nShooting from inside the pedestal, the Time Traveller and his Machine are black silhouettes in the foreground, while beyond him Weena stands on the lawn outside, the moonlight flooding her radiant features. \nInside, black smoke still rises and whirls around as the Time Traveller examines his Machine and starts to fit the lever into place. \nREVERSE ANGLE                                          387 \nThe Time Traveller working eagerly.  A shadow starts sliding across his figure, moving more swiftly until darkness falls and the panel closes with a CLANG. \nOUTSIDE THE PANELS                                     388 \nWeena, seeing the panels close, runs up to them and POUNDS her fists vainly on the metal doors. \nINSIDE THE SPHINX - MOVING SHOT                        389 \nThe Time Traveller leaps to the panels and struggles to open them.  From without he hears Weena's POUNDING and CRIES.  Suddenly he senses a living presence within the sphinx.  For a moment there is silence.  Then from the right comes a hacking, weak COUGH.  Another from the left.  Then some- thing STUMBLES OFF, down the stairway.  He whirls around, GASPING and COUGHING, to see three of the enmaddened Morlocks rising before him.  Avoiding them, he stumbles to his Machine and gets into the saddle.  The suffocating smoke blinds him as he gropes for the lever.  Morlocks seize his legs and try to wrest him off the Machine.  The fire and smoke become dense, half obliterating the struggling bodies. \nINSERT:  THE CONTROL PANNEL                            390 \nThe Time Traveller's hand gropes for the lever and finally grasps it. \nOMITTED                                                391-403 \nINSERT OF DIALS                                        404 \nSpinning backwards.

There is a flash of sunshine, then finally total darkness. \nTIME TRAVELLER - MED.

HILLYER Are you coming, Kemp. \nRising hesitantly, Kemp turns to the Time Traveller. \nKEMP It's getting late and you look exhausted.  You had better get some rest. \nEveryone gets up, Bridewell with difficulty, and starts to leave. \nCOTTAGE - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT) - (MATTE)                415 \nThe snow falls softly, big flakes wobbling down from the sky.  The front door opens letting out the four guests wearing hats, capes and overcoats. They walk toward a waiting carriage, Kemp helping the staggering Bridewell.  Filby is the last to leave.  He pauses at the step of the carriage looking back to the Time Traveller who stands motionless in the doorway. \nFILBY Goodnight, George. \nAT THE ENTRANCE                                        416 \nThe Time Traveller lifts his hand and waves. \nTIME TRAVELLER Thank you, David, for being such a good friend - always. \nWith this he turns and goes into the house, closing the door slowly. \nAT THE CARRIAGE                                        417 \nThose inside are waiting for Filby to get in, but he, deep in thought, still stands gazing back. Kemp thrusts his head from the window. \nKEMP What do you think, Filby? \nFILBY (after a pause) One thing is certain.  Those flowers couldn't have possibly bloomed in the winter-time. \nHILLYER (in the b.g.) You don't really think that story was true? \nFilby reaches a decision. \nFILBY Look, you chaps go on.  It's just a short walk home for me. \nHILLYER (o.s.)

He waits until the carriage disappears, then retraces his steps to the front door and raps on it.  He pauses a moment, then uses the heavy knocker.  There is still no answer.

It is unlocked.  He steps into the house. \nINT. LIBRARY - FULL SHOT                               421 \nThe coals still glow in the grate as Filby enters the fully lit room, looking for his friend.

Filby turns, goes toward it and stops at the doorway. \nDINING ROOM - FILBY'S P.O.V.                           422 \nThe table is cleared, candles extinguished.

The HUMMING HAS REACHED A HIGH SHRIEK and STOPS abruptly. \nBACK TO CLOSE ON MEN - LOW ANGLE                       29 \nThe sudden silence is almost unbearable.  They stare at the empty table.  The CAMERA PANS. \nDR. HILLYER (touches his cigar pocket) I'll be damned! \nTIME TRAVELLER (almost to himself) It worked! \nFilby swallows. \nBridewell, with his mouth open, stares at the table. Now he looks at the glass of champagne in his hand and places it on the mantelpiece as far out of reach as he can.  Then, suddenly reversing his decision, he retrieves the glass and gulps it down. \n30 OUT \nTWO SHOT                                               31 \nDr. Hillyer slowly turns to the Time Traveller. \nDR. HILLYER Where did it go? \nTIME TRAVELLER (recovering) Go?  Nowhere in the usual sense. It's still here. (indicating space where the Machine stood) But it's no longer in the present. It's traveling through time - to the future, to be precise. \nDR. HILLYER Do you seriously expect us to believe that? \nTIME TRAVELLER Certainly. \nDR. HILLYER But you just said it hasn't really moved. \nTIME TRAVELLER That's correct. \nDR. HILLYER Then why can't we see it? \nTIME TRAVELLER Because we're in this room on December 31st, 1899, while the model you saw is perhaps a hundred years away.  This room, or even this house, may no longer exist a hundred years from now.  But the Time Machine is occupying the same space it did a moment before it went off on its journey. \nDr. Hillyer runs his hand over the top of the table. \nDR. HILLYER (exasperated) If it occupies the same space, I should be able to feel it. \nTIME TRAVELLER You must remember that the space you've just put your hand through is today's space.  You can't put your hand into the space of tomorrow. \nDR. HILLYER (getting angry) Space is space!  It doesn't change! The same space that is here now should be here a hundred or even a thousand years from now. \nTIME TRAVELLER No!  Time changes space.  This flat ground we're standing on now could have been at the bottom of the sea a million years ago.  And a million years from now it could be the interior of a huge mountain. \nDr. Hillyer turns away, speechless. \nGROUP SHOT                                             32 \nKemp steps forward. \nKEMP Suppose what you say is true. Exactly what do you suggest we do with such a contraption? \nTIME TRAVELLER For my part, I intend to take a journey into the future. - Unless someone else prefers to volunteer. \n", "test2_id": 1417, "test3_input": "TIME TRAVELLER I am returning to my time!  Not to tell of the uselessness of the struggle - not to tell of the hopeless future - but only so that I can die among men! \nHe turns and strides toward the door. \nEXT. ENTRANCE - MED. SHOT - (DUSK)                     197 \nThe Time Traveller bursts out of the building.  A moment later Weena appears in the archway.  She stands there, looking after him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FOREST - LONG SHOT - (NIGHT)                      198 \nThere are patches of mist and haze between the trees.  With a blazing torch the Time Traveller strides across. \nEXT. TIME TRAVELLER ON THE PATH - (NIGHT)              199 \nComing from the distance the CAMERA PANS HIM TO THE EDGE OF LAWN, where he stops short, jerking the pipe from his mouth, his eyes wide with con- sternation.  He raises the torch high to see: \nEXT. THE LAWN - FULL SHOT - (NIGHT)                    200 \nThere is no Time Machine. \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                201 \nIn stunned shock. \nTHE PATH - FULL SHOT                                   202 \nHolding his torch high, the Time Traveller hurries toward the bushes around the edge of the lawn looking for his Machine, beating the branches with his free hand.  After he passes one of the bushes, a white indistinct creature dashes out of it and disappears in the darkness.  Unaware of this, the Time Traveller stops in the mindle of the lawn where the Machine was last seen. \n(NOTE:  The surrounding is suggestive of the spot where the Time Traveller's house once stood.) \nHe looks about, slowly turning in a complete circle. Meanwhile the CAMERA MOVES IN CLOSE.  Then, sud- denly remembering, he digs his free hand into the pocket of his trouser, drawing out the lever he had removed and looks at it with self-assurance. Returning the lever to his pocket, he drops to his knees and by the light of his torch, scrutinizes the grass. \nTHE GROUND - TIME TRAVELLER'S P.O.V.                   203 \nThe turf has been ripped in parallel grooves as though some heavy object had been dragged across. CAMERA MOVES SLOWLY FORWARD following these grooves and HALTS where small misshapen, half-human foot- prints stand out clearly in the freshly turned earth. \nTIME TRAVELLER - MOVING SHOT                           204 \nHe straightens slowly, his eyes narrowed. Nervously he looks around, then steps on follow- ing the grooves. \nBACK TO THE FOOTPRINTS                                 205 \nTHE CAMERA CONTINUES TO FOLLOW the grooves straight across the lawn to the flagstones around the white sphinx.  There are dark scratches on the stones leading to the wide panel in the base of the pedestal.  Here the marks end. \nAT THE PEDESTAL - MED. SHOT                            206 \nThe Time Traveller pauses, then gives the panel an exploratory KNOCK.  It responds with a HOLLOW SOUND. \nThe Time Traveller thrusts his torch between the claws of the sphinx.  With both hands now free, he tries unsuccessfully to push the panel either to right or left or up or down.  Taking a penknife from his pocket, he runs the blade around the panel's edge hunting for a secret latch.  No success. \nThen he pauses, searching for a tool, and sees a loosened flagstone.  He picks it up.  With this heavy weight he batters the panel.  At each blow it RESOUNDS LOUDLY, not unlike a gong.  Four times he strikes, and then on the fifth blow the rock shatters in his hands.  He stops in despair. \nCLOSE ON TIME TRAVELLER                                207 \nHe senses he is under observation by an unseen presence.  Alarmed, he whips around then looks up to: \nTHE SPHINX - LOW ANGLE - (MINIATURE OR MATTE)          208 \nThe marble face looks baleful, almost smiling in the torch light. \nBACK ON TIME TRAVELLER                                 209 \nHe turns and peers toward: \nTHE BUSHES                                             210 \nIn the shadows, beyond reach of the light, is a wide semi-circle of luminous eyes, reflecting the flame of the torch. \n", "test3_true": "He grabs his torch from the pedestal and slowly paces toward the nearest bush.  But as he ap- proaches, the glowing eyes vanish in the haze, followed by a ghostly impression of pale, fleeing creatures. \nThe Time Traveller halts and turns in another direction.  The same thing happens. \nThen he has an idea.  Bending, he beats the torch against the moist soil and extinguishes it.  Now in the darkness he straightens and waits, peering around until he hears a twig CRACK, then moves into the deep shadow of a tall bush, looking off. \nTHE PATH                                               214 \nThrough the mist in the foliage a pale figure approaches slowly.  It emerges onto the lawn. \nTIME TRAVELLER - MED. SHOT                             215 \nThe CAMERA FOLLOWS as he leaps forward, grapples the other figure and bears it to earth.  For a moment there is a struggle and then the other figure lies perfectly still.  The Time Traveller rears back to get a look at it. \nTHE FIGURE ON THE GROUND - EXTREME CLOSE SHOT          216 \nIt is Weena.  The moving shadow of the Time Traveller reveals her pale face, with closed eyes, wearing an expression of helpless terror.  She appears to be waiting for the inevitable end, but when it does not come, she slowly opens her eyes.  She sees the Time Traveller and her face records a wave of relief. \nThe CAMERA WITHDRAWS TO TWO SHOT as the Time Traveller, embarrassed, helps her sit up. \nWEENA I heard you pounding...I came to tell you... \nTIME TRAVELLER How do you open that panel? \nWEENA No one opens it.  Only the Morlocks. \nTIME TRAVELLER Morlocks? - Who are the Morlocks? \nA look of fear comes into her eyes.  She drifts her gaze away from his, too frightened to answer. Gently he takes her by the shoulders and turns her to face him. \nTIME TRAVELLER Why are you afraid of the Morlocks? \nAgain Weena drops her eyes from him, but he cups his hand beneath her chin and tenderly turns her head back so that her eyes meet his. \nTIME TRAVELLER Tell me. \nWEENA When they call, we must go below. \nTIME TRAVELLER Do the Morlocks live beneath the earth? (Weena nods) Why must you obey their command? \nWEENA They give us the food we eat, the clothes we wear.  We must do as they command. \nTIME TRAVELLER What happens to your people when they go below? \nWEENA (repressing an in- voluntary shudder) No one knows.  No one has ever returned. \nTIME TRAVELLER (smiling at her warmly, reassuringly) It won't happen to you. \nWeena looks up at him, her fears dwindling, find- ing comfort in this strange being whom she cannot understand.  Then she glances high into the dark sky and the old fear returns. \nWEENA It is night. \nTIME TRAVELLER Only children are frightened by the dark. - But then you are a child, aren't you? (Weena glances around warily into the shadows, her anxiety mounting) I'll build a fire. \nWEENA (taking his hand, rises) Let us go from here. \nTIME TRAVELLER (getting up) I can't, child. (walking toward the sphinx) My Machine is inside there, I intend to wait here 'til morning, then find some way of getting inside. \nWEENA (catching up) No, you must not. \nTIME TRAVELLER (stops, then) Help me gather some wood. \nTHE LAWN AND THE BASE - LONG SHOT                      217 \nReluctantly she helps him collect a few twigs which she hands over to him. \nWEENA Where are you from? \n", "test3_id": 1418}

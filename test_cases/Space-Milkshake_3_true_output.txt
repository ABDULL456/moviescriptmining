Tilda stands in the hall of the crew quarters outside the door. Scuttle scuttle sounds. Anton goes near his room, looks around. He creeps toward the door. 
INT. CREW QUARTERS ~ ANTON'S ROOM - NIGHT 122B                                                              122B ANTON Where are you? Hiding. Not so tough now are ya Gary? You'd better hide. Scuttle sound. Anton goes left, toward his coffee table, re- aiming his handlebar, guessing where Gary is hiding. Anton is almost at the door. Anton turns right. The shadow of Gary (Duck 3) rises up next to his bed: the tentacles were just the tip: it's grown larger now. It bares teeth. GARY Where is the Time Cube? ANTON What Time Cube? GARY I must have it. ANTON You come on my space station, try to steal my girlfriend, turn the place upside down and make demands for time cubes. Who do you think I am? Anton prepares to strike. The duck trembles with excitement and rage. Anton grits his teeth. ANTON (CONT'D) AHHHHHHHH! Anton swings his weapon high over his head and charges! Space Milkshake Prod.

INT. CREW QUARTERS ~ HALLWAY - NIGHT 122C                                                              122C Tilda watches from the hallway outside Anton's room: A SUDDEN FLURRY OF MOTION as Gary attacks Anton, SNARLING. Pillows and household items are torn up and thrown around. Crashing sounds. Tilda ducks down, unable to watch the violence. Sounds: Anton yelling, things breaking. Violent crunches and punches. Clanging. Blood sprays on the wall next to Tilda. She's horrified. CUT TO: Jimmy and Valentina come from around the corner at the far end of the hall and stop when they hear the sound of THUMP SCUTTLE SCUTTLE. They cautiously peer down the hall. JIMMY Tilda? Tilda comes out of Anton's room, some blood spray on her face. TILDA I need help. 
INT. RECREATION ROOM - NIGHT 122D                                                              122D They clear off the table and lie Anton down. He's twitching. Valentina touches him and backs away in horror. TILDA Where is the first-aid kit? Jimmy looks around, pulls a medical kit from the wall. TILDA (CONT'D) He's leaking. JIMMY Valentina, get some water. Tilda first-aid examines Anton. He coughs up blood. Jimmy turns around and there's no Valentina. JIMMY (CONT'D) Valentina? Space Milkshake Prod. Draft Rev10b BLUE -    11/12/11   72. 
OMITTED SCENES 123-124 
INT. CONTROL ROOM - NIGHT Valentina sits in a flight deck chair looking at red emergency monitor warning messages. She sits facing the passageway, looks at the blood on her hands. A husky rasping breathing sound comes from Gary who hides around the edge of the doorway. VALENTINA Gary. Why are you doing this? Gary's voice answers from the shadows. It sounds bigger. GARY (O.S.) For you. VALENTINA But you'll kill me as well if the station falls out of orbit. GARY So, are you're with this Anton guy now? VALENTINA I was for a while. Not sure now. GARY (O.S.) He fights like a girl. Do you think he'd cross alternate dimensions for you? VALENTINA I don't know. GARY I travelled through time for you. VALENTINA I know. Space Milkshake Prod.

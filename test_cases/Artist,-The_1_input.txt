He carries on as though it's normal until his shadow walks off with its head bowed. He watches it go, trying to understand what's happening, but it's gone and he's still there. He begins to holler. 
Title card: COME BACK! COME BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!! 
Totally smashed he starts to violently throw film reels against the wall as he hollers. The cans split open and the film bursts out all over. George is becoming more and more frenzied. The floor is now covered in cans and film. He stops, dripping with sweat. Worriedly, he looks around for a moment. Then he strikes a match, takes a second to consider what he's about to do and throws the match into the middle of the reels. 
There's madness in his eyes as he watches the fire take hold. We can see his pleasure at seeing the flames spread. But he's very quickly overrun. The reels burst into flames in an instant and give off lots of smoke. Jack is panicking and barks incessantly. Suddenly, George seems to lose it. He doesn't know what to do anymore and, although the fire is spreading quite spectacularly around him, he runs to where the reels and films that he has not opened are, and begins throwing them frantically over his shoulder as though he's looking for one in particular. The ever-increasing denseness of the smoke, however, is making the task almost impossible. On the floor, below the smoke, Jack flees the room and runs off while George suffocates but continues to struggle with the cans of reels. 
92   EXT. GEORGE'S HOUSE - DAY                                    92 
The dog comes out of the house and makes a dash for the sidewalk as fast as he can. 
(91) In the room, among the flames and the smoke, George - now breathless - picks one of the reels and tries to turn round. He collapses, still holding on to the can. 
93   EXT. POLICEMAN JUNCTION - DAY                                93 
Jack spots a cop at a junction. He takes hold of the cop's trouser leg with his teeth and tries to pull him towards George's house. The policeman doesn't understand, however, and pushes it away with his foot. The dog persists and barks but the cop just wants to be left in peace. 
(91) George is suffocating on the floor. The level of smoke is getting ever lower and is slowly covering his face. 
(93) Jack barks louder and louder. The policeman feels uncomfortable. A woman is watching the scene inquisitively. Not knowing what to do, the cop motions to the dog to be silent and threatens it with two fingers, just like George miming a pistol. Jack collapses and plays dead. The cop has no idea what's happened, he crouches down and touches the dog to see if it's all right. Jack wakes up and goes to leave but stops immediately to show the cop he wants to take him with him. The cop still doesn't understand, it's the woman who tells him what he must do. The cop seems to understand, has a moment of doubt, and then starts following the dog. Jack encourages him to go faster, but the cop resists to begin with. Little by little though, as though realizing the seriousness of the situation, he speeds up. More and more,

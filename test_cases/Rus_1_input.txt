NIKI sits on the podium, in front of microphones, flanked on both sides by FERRARI drivers and top brass. But no one wants to talk to them. Everyone's here to talk to NIKI.. 
JAPANESE JOURNALIST How are you feeling, Niki? 
NIKI Fine. 
AMERICAN JOURNALIST Can you confirm for us exactly which procedures you have had? And the expectations for your recovery? 
(CONTINUED) 167 CONTINUED:                                                    167 
NIKI Sure. I had a skin graft operation where they put half my right thigh in my face. It doesn't look too good but one unexpected advantage is it's impossible to perspire through a skin graft, so sweat will never run in my eyes again - which is good for a driver. 
Laughter. At the back of the hall, JAMES HUNT creeps in, (unseen by anyone, disguised in a hat), to listen. 
BRAZILIAN JOURNALIST When they heard about your condition, Ferrari immediately hired another driver, Carlos Reutemann. 
NIKI Ja. Before even my first operation. 
JAPANESE JOURNALIST Is he your replacement now? 
NIKI No. Just another team-mate. Keen to make an impression. So let's see where Mr. Reutemann finishes today. 
Laughter. 
JAPANESE JOURNALIST James Hunt and McLaren have caught up a lot while you were away. 
NIKI Yes. (a beat) Is there a question now? Or are you just trying to piss me off? 
Laughter. 
JAPANESE JOURNALIST You think you can still win? 
NIKI Of course. I have the better car. I'm the better driver. But he's a clever guy and has used the time well while I was lying half-dead in hospital to win some points.. 
Laughter. 
(CONTINUED) 167 CONTINUED: (2)                                               167 
BRITISH JOURNALIST What did your wife say when she saw your face? 
NIKI She said, "Sweetie, you don't need a face to drive. Only a right foot." 
Laughter. 
BRITISH JOURNALIST I'm being serious. Do you really think your marriage can survive? With the way you look now? 
Silence. NIKI squints into the lights.. 
NIKI And I'm being serious, too. Which asshole said this? Jesus.. 
No one moves. NIKI, disgusted, rips off his microphone.. 
NIKI Fuck you. Press conference over. 
NIKI walks out. The Press Conference breaks up... 
JAMES sees the REPORTER who asked the question, laughing with his friends. JAMES watches as the REPORTER leaves... 
168 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE PRESS CONFERENCE - SAME TIME             168 
JAMES goes after the REPORTER, and calls him.. 
JAMES Hey..! 
The REPORTER turns, recognizes JAMES.. 
JAMES I've got something for you on that last question... 
The BRITISH JOURNALIST smiles, "Great, thanks James!" Pulls out a tape recorder. JAMES takes him to one side, then... 
"WHACK, WHACK, WHACK" - JAMES punches his lights out, then takes the tape recorder, stuffs it into the JOURNALISTS mouth. 
JAMES Now go home to your wife and ask her how YOU look!! 
(CONTINUED) 168 CONTINUED:                                                    168 
"CRASH" a final, sickening blow splits the REPORTER's nose.. 
JAMES Prick! 
169 EXT. STARTING GRID - MONZA - DAY                               169 
JAMES walks out to his car. TV CREWS. Banks of PHOTOGRAPHERS. Commentators talk in different languages. 
Everyone talking about NIKI's comeback. 
NIKI is in his car. The MECHANICS are talking to him in Italian...

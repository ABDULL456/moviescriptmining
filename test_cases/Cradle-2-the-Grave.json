His daughter. FAIT You know it's past your bedtime. VANESSA Just a little longer. FAIT (imitating sweetly) 'Just a little longer'... School tomorrow, baby. Let's go. Vanessa sighs. Fait stands over her as she shuts down the computer, talking her through the commands, making sure she doesn't dawdle. FAIT 'Exit.' 'Quit.' 'Do not save.' 'Special.' 'Shut down.' Sleepy- time. Whereupon he whisks her out of her chair, flies her once around the room and tucks her into bed. FAIT You bag some Z's now, you hear? VANESSA Okay. FAIT ... Wait a second. VANESSA What? FAIT I think there's something behind your \near. VANESSA Oh, please, that is so lame.     It's in your hand. \nShe takes his right hand, opens it and turns it over. Nothing. Takes his left hand, opens it and turns it over. More nothing. She's stumped. Fait smiles. Puts his hands together. When he opens them, there is the pink diamond pendant on the chain. VANESSA How'd you do that? \nFait slips the chain over her head and kisses her. FAIT Good night. Then Fait looks up.     Addresses the air above her. FAIT Angels east, angels west, north and south, do your best. Guard her, watch her, while she rests. A bedtime ritual. Fait goes. When she's alone, Vanessa holds up the diamond, which catches every bit of available light and shines in the dark. Then she rolls over and closes her eyes. \nINT. FAIT'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT Fait enters.     Vanessa's nanny, TONITA, is there.    To Tonita FAIT She'll stay down now. TONITA She won't listen to me lately.     Only you. FAIT I'll have a talk with her about it tomorrow. Still to the nanny -- FAIT I got some work to do in the office. You can go on to bed. \nTONITA I'm watching TV, if you need me. Fait exits. \nINT. FAIT'S BAR/LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION Fait enters.    Tommy and Daria are there. \nTOMMY What the hell happened? Fait puts a finger to his lips.    Leads them across the room to another door. \n", "test1_true": "rethink the no-gun policy. TOMMY Little ass-whuppin's nothing. 'Least you didn't have to play all foxy with the rent-a-cop. \nFait pulls out the bag of black diamonds. FAIT Means this is all we got. DARIA So what do we do? FAIT You all wait to hear from me. TOMMY Where're you going? FAIT To get some answers. Miles moves to go with him. MILES I got your back. FAIT No. I got us into this.     I'll call you if I need you. Daria moves to him.   Their eyes meet. DARIA Be careful. Fait gives her a kiss.   Then goes. \nINT. CHRISTOPHE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT Christophe's arms are   wrapped around the large fish tank, one arm over the top,   the other through the legs of the stand. His hands are    bound. He can't move. His beaten face is pressed to the   glass. Large, weird fish swim past in front of him. The weird fish scatter as a face appears on the other side of the tank. Ling. Looking through at Christophe. Ling straightens and walks around the tank. Sona is with him. So is Charles, the bodyguard. In b.g., the two thugs stand sentry near the front door. Christophe's eyes follow them. \nLING So this is Mr. Christophe? SONA Yes. Only the handcuffs and fish tank are a new look. LING Apparently we're not his first visitors today. CHRISTOPHE Please, Monsieur Ling -- Ling interrupts him with a hand on the shoulder. \nLING Whatever you're going to say... Make it the truth. \nEXT. ARCHIE'S AMERICAN SURPLUS - M1A1 TANK - NIGHT Sitting in the middle of the large lot, which is full of hot goods and military surplus equipment. The tank's turret is spinning around. The cannon elevating and depressing seemingly at random. When... The cannon stops. Having locked on...Fait, standing in front of the tank. From inside the tank, a muffled voice. VOICE (O.S.) Bang. A hatch opens. ARCHIE, a fairly straight-ahead-looking man, pops his head up out of the tank. ARCHIE Like it? FAIT It's cool. As Archie climbs out of the tank and joins Fait -- ARCHIE Want it? Give you a good deal. Ammo included... Reactive armor, twin M240 machine guns, 120mm smoothbore cannon. Guaranteed to get you through the rougher areas of the city and keep the neighbors in line. FAIT Pass. \nARCHIE How about a Marine Corps assault hovercraft? FAIT I got other business. Fait and Archie walk to a work table. Nearby, two MEN UNLOAD HOT TVS from a truck. One Man calls to Archie. MAN UNLOADING HOT TVS We're outta room over here, Arch. ARCHIE Stack 'em in the office, if you have to. Then Archie turns his attention back to Fait. ARCHIE ... You weren't downtown tonight by any chance, were you, Tony? FAIT Don't know what you're talking about. ARCHIE Me either. FAIT Ever see black diamonds before? ARCHIE White, blue, yellow, pink. Neil Diamond. Lou Diamond Phillips. Black diamonds? Solid rocks? No. Whereupon Fait opens the nylon bag and pours the black diamonds out onto the table. Archie pulls out a loup. Studies them a moment. Shrugs. ARCHIE You got me. FAIT Find out how much they're worth. ARCHIE There a timetable on this, or -- FAIT Yesterday. ARCHIE That's what I figured. \nFait's heading out. FAIT I'll be back. I gotta go fuck over a guy who fucked me over. \nINT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - NIGHT Fait opens a door with an electronic lock pick. \nINT. CHRISTOPHE'S APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS Fait enters. Stops a moment, his back against the closed door, while his eyes adjust to the dark. Then moves quietly out into the room. Looking for Christophe. Fait continues moving around through the room. When he steps in something wet. He bends down and checks it out. Water. The carpet's soaked. His eyes go to something. Fait finds a cord and turns on a switch. The light in the fish tank snaps on. REVEAL Christophe.     Stuffed inside the tank.     Sleeping with the fishes. SU (O.S.) Looks dead to me. Behind him.   Fait turns around.      Sees Su.   Sitting on a sofa. FAIT Guess you got to him first. SU Not me.     Someone else. Fait does the math. FAIT ... You're the one who called me. The one who took on my guy... Who the fuck are you, man? SU My name is Su. FAIT Cool.     I'm Sally. SU I want the black stones. \n", "test1_id": 2526, "test2_input": "FAIT Tommy and Archie.

HANGAR In here, the hangar door continues to open as the tank makes its slow approach. Archie's not a great driver. Tommy sweeps the muzzle of the machine gun across the group. TOMMY Just be cool! At which point, Russell breaks for his five-ton truck. \nTOMMY I said don't move, motherfucker! Russell just keeps going. Slides open the side door in the back of the five-ton, revealing... A twin-fifty machine gun. Two barrels, .50 caliber. Dangerous even for a tank. Russell vaults in and takes aim. RUSSELL Fucking amateurs! He starts FIRING. People start running. .50 CAL. ROUNDS take big CHUNKS out of whatever they hit. TOMMY Shit!   What do we do? \nARCHIE Shoot back! TOMMY How? The question's answered for him.   He somehow does the right thing. And...

HANGAR Ling, having just escaped being crushed in the limo, runs out just as... Four helicopters take off, one after the other, carrying the buyers away. The fifth chopper, an AGUSTA A109, is POWERED UP, waiting for the wheelchair-bound French Buyer, being helped by a bodyguard. Ling intercepts them. Knocks out the bodyguard and tips over the Frenchman's chair. Then jumps into the Agusta. \nINT. AGUSTA - COCKPIT Ling puts a gun to the pilot's head. LING Go! \nEXT.

Just in time to... Grab onto one of the retractable rear wheels. \nEXT. AGUSTA As the chopper transfers to forward motion, Su struggles to get a foot hooked on something, anything. In the process, he kicks against the helo's sleek underbelly. \nINT. AGUSTA Ling hears the THUMPS.

AGUSTA - COCKPIT The pilot hopelessly fights to keep the chopper from crashing. \nEXT. AIRFIELD The out-of-control AGUSTA swings back toward Su and the hangar, losing altitude. Then SMASHES into the tarmac, ripping open the fuel tank, spilling fuel behind it as it caroms off the hangar and inscribes a large, skidding circle around Su before CRASHING into another CHOPPER and BURSTING INTO FLAMES. The spilled fuel ignites.    A circle of intense fire.   With Su in the middle. The Agusta pilot, still alive, has been thrown outside the circle. But Ling's only path of escape takes him inside. Into the circle. He emerges with the bag of stones. Su is waiting. LING \nYou were lucky last time.   You Won't be lucky again. The final fight begins. The two martial arts masters battle in the circle of fire, using everything they can lay their hands on. Each the equal of the other. Each knowing it's a fight to the death.

You won't Feel a thing. \nSU ... I won't.    You will What happens next happens in an instant: Su breaks the hold. Hooks one of Ling's arms.   Wrenches it. A direction it can't go. Ling's ARM BONES SNAP, TISSUES RIP. Ling screams in pain. Just as... Su pulls the ceramic Capsule containing the activated sliver of stone from Ling's pocket. And... Slams the capsule deep into Ling's open mouth. Ling gags, choking on the capsule lodged in his throat. His horror- stricken eyes meet Su's. Su lets him suffer another moment. Then, in SUBTITLED Chinese -- SU This is for our friends. And Su strikes him in the throat. A spearing, open-hand blow with his fingertips. Hard. Hard enough that... \n", "test3_id": 2528}

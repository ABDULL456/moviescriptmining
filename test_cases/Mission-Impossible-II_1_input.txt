NYAH But I don't have a conscience.  I'm a bloody thief. 
ETHAN You can be a thief and have a conscience. 
NYAH No.  You can be a thief and have a conscience:  Not me.  Why did you have to tell me about this! (pouring herself a drink) What do I have to do to get away from this guy?  When you're with him, he messes about with your head every waking moment..even now I'll be at some out-of- the-way-place, a tin of caviar and a bottle of Crystal shows up at the table, with two glass, God knows how he finds out at any given moment where I am in the world but he does.  And it looks like he's done it again.  You know his definition of a  true paranoid? 
ETHAN I don't. 
NYAH Someone in possession of all the facts. (she turns away, pauses) Are you telling me I have to do this? 
ETHAN Generally, I don't favor coercing someone. Not when there's a chance my life could end up in their hands. 
NYAH And that's the only reason? 
ETHAN Can you think of a better one? 
NYAH Not me.  I was just hoping you might..or that..somehow in the course of business this got personal as well as physical. 
ETHAN Look, would it make you feel better if I didn't want you to do this? 
NYAH Much. 
ETHAN Then feel better!.. 
Long moment while she looks at him. 
ETHAN (cont'd) Well.  That made all the difference in the world, didn't it? 
Ethan walks out onto the balcony.  She looks at his back. 
NYAH Sean will never be anything but suspicious if he picks up some sort of 'yoo-hoo-I'm- not-nad' message.  Not after the way we broke up. 
ETHAN What wouldn't make him suspicious? 
NYAH Probably that I needed him in some urgent way..destitute - in serious trouble..the kind I couldn't possible sort out myself.. 
Ethan's been smiling slightly. 
ETHAN Serious trouble, Nyah, is something I can always arrange.. 
NYAH IN A SPANISH JAIL 
standing for front and side mug shot.  O.S. sound of teletype continues.  SUPERIMPOSE:  Ethan holding up something the size of a dime: 
ETHAN This little chip sends a coded signal that can be picked up only by our computer. 
On the screen of the GPS computer, a little yellow blip appears pulsating on the screen. 
ETHAN'S VOICE When it's in your ankle we can track you within three feet of anywhere in the world. 
OVER ETHAN AND ONTO COMPUTER SCREEN 
He types a small Interpol bulletin stating that Nyah Nordoff Hall, apprehended March 13 in Seville, is awaiting extradition while the authorities in London, Paris, and Amsterdam squabble over where she's going to be tried first, for the various thefts and burglaries she's committed in the three cities. 
COMPUTER SCREEN (AMBROSE TENT ANNEX - DAY) 
Ambrose picking up on a version of the Interpol bulletin Ethan's put out.  He leans over the screen for a moment, then moves to the window, and stares out thoughtful at the bay, almost as if he were watching... 
EXT - NYAH IN JAIL COURTYARD 
From a beautiful blue sky,  pan down to the courtyard of the jail where Nyah is allowed out for an airing, seemingly alone but being watched by: 
ETHAN AND COMPUTER SCREEN 
His attention fixed on the screen, Ethan stares at satellite shot of Nyah in the jail courtyard. 
INT - PRISON - NYAH 
being allowed a phone call, a prison guard visible b.g.  Cross cut with Ethan. 
ETHAN Look, I can't run your arrest in CNN, but I guarantee he's monitoring every law enforcement agency in the world, for what they might be saying about him, if nothing else - he's got the ability and, we assume, the desire to get you out of there. 
NYAH This doesn't seem to be accomplishing much. 
ETHAN Well, I mean it's not a total loss.  It is keeping a very capable thief off the street.. 
NYAH Very funny..maybe he has heard and doesn't want to know.  Maybe he's lost interest. 
Her guard, b.g. is handed a note.

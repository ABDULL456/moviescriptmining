{"test1_input": "CHAMBER: \nBRUTUS So it must fall out with him, Or our authorities at an end. \nSICINIUS We must suggest to the people in what \nHATRED He still hath held them. \nBRUTUS \n(SHUSHING HIM) Peace... \nThey enter the Senate Chamber... \nINT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY \nBrutus and Sicinius make their way to their seats as we hear: \nMENENIUS (V.0.) It remains, As the main point of this our after- meeting, To gratify his noble service that Hath thus stood for his country... The interior of the grand Senate is an airy, sweeping chamber that suggests the Israeli Knesset or U.N. General Assembly. Again, classical symmetry is the rule with tiers of seats facing a central dais. An imposing piece of outdated modern art suggesting the might of Rome looms over the chamber like a bird of prey. Network TV cameras purr quietly from a corner. Menenius, Cominius, Coriolanus and several other politicos are seating at a central table on the dais, facing the rows of SENATORS. Menenius is standing at a podium, speaking into a microphone: \nMENENIUS Therefore, please you, Most reverend and grave elders, to desire The present Consul, and last general In our well-found successes, to report A little of that worthy work performed By Caius Martius Coriolanus. \nSENATOR Speak, good Cominius. General Cominius rises and moves to the podium. But then Coriolanus abruptly stands-- \nMENENIUS Nay, keep your place. \nSENATOR Sit, Coriolanus. Never shame to hear What you have nobly done. \nCORIOLANUS Your honors' pardon. I had rather have my wounds to heal again Than hear say how I got them. \nMENENIUS Pray now, sit down. \nCORIOLANUS I had rather have one scratch my head in \nTHE SUN When the alarum were struck than idly sit To hear my nothings monstered. Coriolanus moves across the dais and exits into a hallway. The door shuts after him. Menenius sighs. Nods to Cominius. Cominius moves to the podium and begins to read his speech from a Teleprompter. This all has the rehearsed quality of a campaign nomination speech. \nCOMINIUS The deeds of Coriolanus Should not be uttered feebly. It is held That valor is the chiefest virtue, and Most dignifies the haver. Alone he \nENTERED The mortal gate of the city, And struck Corioles like a planet, From face to foot He was a thing of blood... Brutus and Sicinius exchange a glance, bored by the political boilerplate. \nINT. SENATE-SERVICE CORRIDOR - DAY \nMeanwhile, Coriolanus stands in the service corridor beyond the chamber. Green industrial walls. Ugly fluorescent lights above. He leans against a wall, alone with his thoughts. Cominius' voice can be heard droning inside. Then Coriolanus glances up. A CUSTODIAN is pushing a garbage can down the long corridor. He stops when he sees Coriolanus. Coriolanus' cool, uncompromising stare makes the Custodian uneasy. He turns around and goes back. \nCoriolanus waits. His face strangely vacant. He flexes his wounded arm. It hurts. He hears Cominius finish. A good round of applause. He hears his name being cheered: \"Coriolanus!\" Coriolanus closes his eyes, steels himself, and then re- enters the chamber... \nINT. SENATE CHAMBER - DAY \nMenenius greets him and escorts him to the podium for his \"acceptance speech.\" \nMENENIUS The Senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased To make thee Consul! Menenius steps back. A beat. Coriolanus stares at the Senators. At the TV cameras. He leans awkwardly into the podium microphone: \nCORIOLANUS I do owe them still My life and services. A beat. For an acceptance speech, rather terse. Menenius jumps in to salvage the moment: \nMENENIUS It then remains That you do speak to the people. \n", "test1_true": "ENTREAT THEM For my wounds' sake to give their suffrage. Please you that I may pass this doing. From the Senate floor, Sicinius jumps on this: \nSICINIUS Sir, the people Must have their voices! \nThe Senators, led by Brutus, clamor their agreement. Tradition must be obeyed. \nMENENIUS (calming, to Coriolanus) Pray you, go fit you to the custom. \nCORIOLANUS It is a part That I shall blush in acting, and might \nWELL Be taken from the people. Menenius quickly turns off Coriolanus' microphone. \nBRUTUS \n(TO SICINIUS) Mark you that? \nCORIOLANUS To brag unto them \"Thus I did, and thus!\" Show them the unaching scars which I should hide, As if I had received them for the hire Of their breath only! Menenius sees Coriolanus is getting angry, this could be disastrous. He elegantly gestures for Cominius to escort Coriolanus out immediately -- as he addresses the Senators and TV cameras: \nMENENIUS To our noble Consul Wish we all joy and honor! He applauds. The applause is taken up by the Senators. Some cheering as well for the hero of Rome The two Tribunes, however, are already whispering maliciously to other Senators. Menenius seems pleased with the general response. So far, so good. \nINT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY \nVolumnia is pleased as well. She sits, watching the events unfold on TV. The sound of the cheering fades as we go to... \nINT. MENENIUS' LIMO - DAY \nThe limousine winds through the pedestrian traffic toward the Roman marketplace. Coriolanus sits with Menenius. Coriolanus is both angry and embarrassed. He is wearing a sharp business suit. \nMENENIUS Have you not known The worthiest men have done it? \nCORIOLANUS \n(AGREES) Custom calls me to it. What custom wills, in all things should we do... What must I say? \"Look, sir, my wounds. I got them in my country's service.\" \nMENENIUS O me, the gods! You must not speak like that. You must \nDESIRE THEM To think upon you-- \nCORIOLANUS \"Think upon me\"? Hang 'em! I would they would forget me. \nMENENIUS You'll mar all! The limo stops. They are at the marketplace. The moment has come. Menenius takes a breath. Urges calm: \nMENENIUS Pray you, speak to them, I pray you, In wholesome manner. \nCORIOLANUS \n(SOURLY) Bid them wash their faces And keep their teeth clean. He leaves the car. \nEXT. MARKETPLACE - DAY \nThe commercial heart of Rome. A large town square, since antiquity used as a marketplace. But now it is filled with tatty stalls selling cheap purses and knock-off watches. Paltry fruit stands alongside shabby souvenir stalls. Advertising billboards surround and pollute the square -- SONY. COKE. NIKE. MCDONALDS -- obscuring any classical architecture that might have survived. Tamora and Cassius, the political activists, are in the crowd. They watch closely. Coriolanus slowly walks to the center of the marketplace. He stands, feeling ridiculous and not at all humble. He looks around. Waiting for something to happen. The CUSTOMERS and SHOPKEEPERS just look back at him. Some are curious. Some are amused. Some hostile and most indifferent. But no one approaches. Then Coriolanus understands. He must g to them: beg for votes. He prepares himself and then slowly moves through the various stalls, weaving in and out. Trying to maintain his dignity. He sees the Citizens from before and goes to them. We glimpse Brutus and Sicinius amongst the crowd. \nCORIOLANUS \n", "test1_id": 264, "test2_input": "TAMORA No, no! No one saw them! \nCASSIUS (inciting the crowd) Was not this mockery? Brutus presses hard: \nBRUTUS When he had no power, But was a petty servant to the state, He was your enemy, ever spake against Your liberties. \nSICINIUS Did you perceive He did solicit you in free contempt When he did need your loves, and do you \nTHINK That his contempt shall not be bruising \nTO YOU When he hath power to crush? \nCassius and Tamora carefully lead the crowd in expressing growing alarm and resistance to Coriolanus: \nCASSIUS He's not confirmed; we may deny him yet! \nTAMORA And will deny him! I'll have five hundred voices of that sound. \nCASSIUS I twice five hundred and their friends! The crowd roars approval. A frightening, animal sound. \nSICINIUS Let them assemble, And on a safer judgment all revoke Your ignorant election. \nBRUTUS Enforce his pride, And his old hate unto you! \nSICINIUS And presently, when you have drawn your number, Repair to the Capitol. \nCASSIUS We will so! \nTAMORA We will so! All Repent in their election! Cassius and Tamora lead the crowd. It is a terrifying spectacle of sudden mob rage, only a razor-thin edge to violence. Brutus and Sicinius watch, satisfied, like Robespierre and Saint Just looking over the bloody guillotine. \nINT. SENATE-CORRIDOR - DAY \nCoriolanus, dressed again in his familiar uniform, emerges from an antechamber with his comrade Titus. Menenius, General Cominius and several pro-Coriolanus Senators follow them. They stride down the corridor. \nCORIOLANUS \n(TO TITUS) Tullus Aufidius then has assembled a new army? \nTITUS He has, my lord. \nCORIOLANUS Saw you Aufidius? \nTITUS He is retired to Antium. \nCORIOLANUS Spoke he of me? \nTITUS He did, my lord. \nCORIOLANUS How? What? \nTITUS How often he had met you, sword to sword; That of all things upon the earth he \nHATED Your person most. \nCORIOLANUS At Antium lives he? \n", "test2_true": "CORIOLANUS I wish I had a cause to seek him there, To oppose his hatred fully. They hear the growing rumble of a crowd. Curious. They continue on and turn a corner to... \nINT. SENATE-CENTRAL LOBBY - DAY \nThe central lobby of the Senate is an open, airy space. Through the glass doors at the front of the lobby an unruly crowd can be seen gathering. Police. Barricades. Sicinius and Brutus are waiting to intercept them. \nCORIOLANUS \n(TO TITUS) Behold, these are the Tribunes of the people, The tongues of the common mouth. \nSICINIUS Pass no further. \nCORIOLANUS Ha! What is that? \nBRUTUS It will be dangerous to go on. No further. \nCORIOLANUS What makes this change? \nMENENIUS The matter? \nCOMINIUS Hath he not passed the nobles and the commons? \nBRUTUS Cominius, no. Coriolanus steps closer to Brutus. The mob sees him through the glass doors. The tension immediately increases. \nCORIOLANUS Have I had children's voices? \nTITUS Tribunes, give way. \nBRUTUS The people are incensed against him. \nCORIOLANUS (glancing to the growing \nCROWD) Are these your herd? \nMENENIUS Be calm, be calm. \nBRUTUS The people cry you mocked them, and of late called them Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness. \nCORIOLANUS But this was known before. \nSICINIUS You show too much of that For which the people stir. If you will \nPASS To where you are bound, you must inquire your way. The crowd outside is growing restless, sensing and responding to the building tension. The police try to hold them back, keeping them away from the doors. The crowd presses in. We see Cassius and Tamora at the forefront, urging the crowd on. \nMENENIUS Let's be calm-- \nCOMINIUS The people are abused, set on-- \nMENENIUS Not now, not now-- \nTITUS Not in this heat, sir-- Coriolanus strides angrily toward the doors and exits-- The others follow-- \nEXT. SENATE-COURTYARD - DAY \n", "test2_id": 265, "test3_input": "TAMORA He's a disease that must be cut away. \nMENENIUS 0, he's a limb that has but a disease: Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy. What has he done to Rome that's worth his death? Eh? Killing our enemies?! He sees that his words are having some effect, he presses the \nPOINT: \nMENENIUS The blood he hath lost -- He dropped it for his country. Some in the room murmur agreement. \nBRUTUS We'll hear no more-- \nMENENIUS Consider this: he has been bred in the \nWARS Since he could draw a sword, and is ill \nSCHOOLED In graceful language Give me leave, I'll go to him, and undertake to bring \nHIM Where he shall answer by a lawful form, In peace, to his utmost peril. \nPRO-CORIOLANUS SENATOR Noble tribunes, It is the humane way. \nANOTHER SENATOR The other course Will prove too bloody, and the end of it Unknown to the beginning. Sicinius is about to retort when Brutus stops him. Brutus assents, assuming the voice of reason: \nBRUTUS Be you then as the people's officer. Menenius and Coriolanus' supporters are relieved. \nBRUTUS If you bring not Martius, we'll proceed In our first way. \nMENENIUS I'll bring him to you. He goes quickly. Brutus turns to Sicinius and Tamora and begins to quietly explain his plan. \nINT. MARTIUS VILLA-CORRIDOR - DAY \nCoriolanus strides angrily down a long corridor, in and out of shafts of light, seething to Titus: \nCORIOLANUS Let them pull all about mine ears, \nPRESENT ME Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels, Yet will I still be thus to them--! \nTITUS \nMARTIUS-- \nCORIOLANUS \n(CONTINUING UNABATED) I muse my mother Does not approve me further! He slams through a door to the living room... \nINT. VILLA -- LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAnd stomps to confront his mother, who is currently conspiring with Menenius and a few Senators. \nCORIOLANUS (to Volumnia, angrily) I talk of you! Why did you wish me milder? Would you \nHAVE ME False to my nature? Rather say I play The man I am! She is equally tough with him, not giving an inch, snapping \nRIGHT BACK: \nVOLUMNIA 0, sir, sir, sir, I would have had you put your power well on, Before you had worn it out. \n", "test3_true": "VOLUMNIA You might have been enough the man you are, With striving less to be so! \nCORIOLANUS Let them hang! \nVOLUMNIA Av, and burn too! Her outraged fury matches his. Overpowers his. \nMENENIUS \n(TO CORIOLANUS) Come, come, you have been too rough, something too rough. You must return and mend it. Coriolanus turns away. \nVOLUMNIA Pray, be counseled. I have a heart as little apt as yours, But yet a brain that leads my use of \nANGER To better vantage. \nMENENIUS Well said, noble woman! \nCORIOLANUS What must I do? \nMENENIUS Return to the Tribunes. \nCORIOLANUS Well, what then? What then? \nMENENIUS Repent what you have spoke. \nCORIOLANUS For them? I cannot do it to the gods. Must I then do it to them? \nVOLUMNIA You are too absolute, Though therein you can never be too noble. \nCORIOLANUS (upset, walking away) Why force you this? She pursues him: \nVOLUMNIA Because that now it lies you on to speak To the people, not by your own instruction, Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you, But with such words that are but \nREHEARSED IN Your tongue, though but bastards and \nSYLLABLES Of no allowance to your bosom's truth... She moves closer to him. Her voice lower. A sort of seduction. \nVOLUMNIA I would dissemble with my nature where My fortunes and my friends at stake \nREQUIRED I should do so in honor... She is very close now. Whispering. She touches him gently, like a lover. \nVOLUMNIA I am in this your wife, your son, These senators, the nobles And you. A long beat. All are silent, watching her spin her web. \nVOLUMNIA I prithee now, my son, Go and say to them Thou art their soldier, and being bred in \nBROILS Has not the soft way In asking their good loves; but thou wilt \nFRAME Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs. \nMENENIUS This but done, even as she speaks, Why their hearts were yours. \nVOLUMNIA Prithee now, Go, and be ruled... (laughing to him) Although I know thou hadst rather Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf Than flatter him in a bower. Coriolanus smiles. A genuinely sweet moment between them. Cominius enters with several other political supporters. \nCOMINIUS Sir, it is fit You make strong party, or defend yourself By calmness or by absence. All's in anger. \n", "test3_id": 266}

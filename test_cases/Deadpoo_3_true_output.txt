49      INT.   DEADPOOL'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT - PRESENT                      49 
...the PAST reaches the PRESENT. REGULAR SPEED AGAIN. DEADPOOL is sitting on his futon, Crocs on, staring at camera. 
DEADPOOL There. All caught up. (shifts weight, moans, lies back on futon) 
BLIND AL (O.S.) Tylenol P.M.? 
BLIND AL shuffles over from the kitchen with a cup of tea and a bottle of Tylenol. She eases down onto the futon next to Deadpool.

DEADPOOL You can stick that where you stuck the Bactine! I found my stash of wisdom- tooth Percocet in the Storjorm, and I'm orbiting Saturn. But I appreciate the gesture. 
Deadpool lays his head on Blind Al's shoulder and gently rubs her face with his KID HAND. 
BLIND AL Am I crazy, or is your hand really small? 
DEADPOOL The size of a KFC spork. 
BLIND AL Eesh. I get why you're so pissy. But your mood's never gonna brighten `til you find this woman you love and tell her how you feel! 
DEADPOOL What do I keep saying, Mrs. Magoo? She wouldn't have me! If you could see me, you'd understand. 
BLIND AL Love is blind, Wade. 
DEADPOOL No, you're blind. 
The ROOMBA sucks up THREE SCREWS next to an IVAR shelving unit. 
BLIND AL What was that? 
DEADPOOL A clue why our Ivar shelving unit's about to fall the fuck apart. 
BLIND AL So you're just gonna lie there and whimper? 
DEADPOOL Just clocking time `til this arm plows through puberty. I've got a new Christmas Day.

Deadpool throws his feet, CROCS and all, up on the coffee table. 
DEADPOOL (CONT'D) Now, ya may want to leave the room. (beat) I bet it feels huge in this hand. 
RS50   INT.   SISTER MARGARET'S - NIGHT                            RS50 
WEASEL is on the house phone.    The bar is BUSTLING. 
WEASEL Wade, we got a problem.    And by we I mean you. 
VB51   EXT.   NO. 5 ORANGE - NIGHT                                 VB51 
DEADPOOL and WEASEL walk hastily, purposefully into the eye of the storm. Deadpool is a HOT MESS. 
DEADPOOL I'm about to lose what's left of my shit. Is there a word for half-afraid, half- furious? 
WEASEL Afurious? Wait, is it Monday?! They have an amazing Matzah Ball Soup Monday. (beat) Never mind. Have you figured what you're gonna tell her? 
DEADPOOL (thinks) Fuck. 
WEASEL It's a start. 
51A    INT.   `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                        51A 
Lights flash. Music pumps. From across the room we see WADE and WEASEL enter. Weasel jokes with the DOORMAN while Wade scans the crowd, searching for Vanessa. 
EMCEE STAN LEE, sweatsuit, gold chains, Beats headphones, lords from a glass cubicle: 
STAN LEE Coming onto the stage, give it up for... Chastity! Deadpool   Final Shooting Script   11/16/15 
52   INT.   `NO. 5 ORANGE' STRIP CLUB - NIGHT                             52 
WEASEL Or as I like to call her, Irony! 
DEADPOOL navigates through a TIGHTLY-PACKED CROWD toward the MAIN STAGE, accompanied by WEASEL. 
DEADPOOL We gotta find her fast.    Before fuck-ass. 
WEASEL How do you even know she's here? 
DEADPOOL I come for the French Onion Soup. How do you think? I'm constantly stalking that fox. 
Deadpool STOPS in his tracks, STARING. 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) Every time I see her is like the first time. 
REVERSE ANGLE to reveal what Deadpool is looking at: the gorgeous backside of a COCKTAIL WAITRESS in a skimpy dress. Back to Deadpool: 
DEADPOOL (V.O.) Even from this angle. Especially from this angle.

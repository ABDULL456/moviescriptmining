KEVIN Hey...what was that all about? 
GIRL HOLDING OUT FOR FINCH He's still embarrassed because Finch kicked his ass.  Knocked out a tooth, but you can't see it. 
KEVIN Right, and who told you that? 
EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD - DAY 
Kevin is talking to GRETA.  She points offscreen. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - LIBRARY - DAY 
Kevin is talking to SOME CHICK.  Taking notes. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - OUTDOOR MURAL - DAY 
Kevin is talking to YET ANOTHER GIRL.  We see that his notepad is a spiderweb of girl's names, all interlinked with arrows.  They all point to one girl's name in the center of the page -- Jessica. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - CAFETERIA - DAY 
Kevin follows Jessica down the cafeteria line. 
JESSICA No comment. 
KEVIN No comment?!  Are you kidding me?! I've never seen someone's image change so...so drastically! 
JESSICA Thanks.  It was my idea. 
KEVIN Did you guys hook up or something? 
JESSICA Are you kidding?  No. 
KEVIN Then what the hell are you talking about? 
JESSICA Well...I guess it's okay for me to tell you now.  That reputation of his isn't going anywhere. (then) Finch comes to me and says, "Jessica, I need help with this, blah blah, etcetera."  So I told him, pay me two- hundred bucks, and I'll tell a couple girls that you're dynamite in bed.  So he did, and I did. 
KEVIN I don't get it, that really works? 
JESSICA Duh.  Of course.  Naturally, I embellished a little bit.  Hey, did you hear that Finch had sex with an older woman? 
Kevin is speechless. 
JESSICA (CONT'D) No?  Damn, that one was my favorite. 
INT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - GUY'S SHOWERS/LOCKER ROOM - DAY 
Toweled guys exit the steamy showers, doing a macho GREAT FALLS LACROSSE CHANT.  They exit frame, and we remain on the showers, to hear -- 
OZ (singing happily) ...I needed the shelter of someone's arms...there you were -- woo-hoo- hoo... 
He exits in a towel and goes to his locker, next to Stifler. 
OZ (CONT'D) (still singing) ...I needed someone to understand my ups and my downs, oh baby there you were... 
Stifler is staring at Oz, horrified. 
STIFLER Oh my fucking God.  You're gay. 
OZ (cheery) Come on, you know the words, sing along. 
STIFLER No thanks, you've been singing that shit all week.  If you try that at MSU this Saturday, I'm pretending I don't know you. 
Oz stops. 
OZ Our last game is this Saturday. 
STIFLER No shit. 
EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - COURTYARD, A BENCH - LATER 
Heather is studying outside.  Oz stands before her, breathless, his hair still wet. 
OZ ...I've got this lacrosse game.  It's really important, it's our last game. And you know, Central almost beat us last time, so I really want to kick their ass, and it's like cool because we're gonna get to play at State, which means that after the game I might be able to stop by... 
HEATHER (pause) You can't sing at the competition. 
OZ I'm sorry, I totally spaced.  I just...I didn't realize it... 
HEATHER (upset but trying to be cool) ...it's okay, you should do whatever makes you happy. 
OZ Alright...yeah...thanks for understanding. (a beat) So I guess...I'll see you later. 
An uncomfortable moment.  Oz walks off.  Heather looks let down. 
EXT. EAST GREAT FALLS HIGH - ENTRANCE TO SENIOR LOCKERS - DAY 
Kevin is at his locker, getting ready for class.  Stifler comes running up with a wicked grin on his face.

Bill the Butcher has just gutshot the Militia Commander. 
As if the shot were a signal, the Natives TURN on the militia. It's hellish, close-quarter combat. Guns fired inches from enemies who had just been allies. Knives, swords, bludgeons, kids with dead-rat blackjacks, women with hob-nailed wooden planks, attacking better-armed but totally stunned soldiers. 
Bill the Butcher falls back toward the Armory, the Natives following him. 
Inside the Armory, Amsterdam turns to his own greatly diminished gang. 
AMSTERDAM Go ahead them, give them cover! Give them some damn cover! 
The Rabbits are so stunned to be fighting on the same side as their sworn enemies that, even with Amsterdam's order, no one makes a move. It's Amsterdam who FIRES the first shots. And that unleashes a great VOLLEY from the Armory... 
... toward the militia. 
The Butcher and the Natives are closer to the Armory now... and the Armory doors start to open... 
... when a MILITIA LIEUTENANT SIGNALS ... 
... and MILITIA on the surrounding roofs, waiting for this moment, suddenly open fire...on the Natives below and on the Rabbits on the roof of the armory. Many drop in the street and fall from the Armory roof... 
... as the Armory doors SWING WIDE to admit the Natives. As they run or stagger inside, the Rabbits start to close the doors. Some Rabbits are cut down by the fire from the rooftops. Other Natives never make it to the doors. And a few are shot... 
... when the doors close before they can get through. 
CUT TO 
123 INT./EXT. ARMORY DAY 
The Dead Rabbits keep firing, but they have sustained grave losses. The Butcher looks around at the Natives who have made it inside with him: he has perhaps one-quarter of his original strength. 
BILL THE BUTCHER Well, it seems like between us we got two mobs that might make a gang. 
AMSTERDAM Whose gang might it be? 
BILL THE BUTCHER Not William Tweed's. 
Jimmy Spoils and a crew of Natives PUSH a cannon toward the rear of the Armory. 
AMSTERDAM Which way you pointing that? 
JIMMY SPOILS Any way you say. One direction could let us out, the other will let them in. 
BILL THE BUTCHER They got to come in if we're going to fight them. 
AMSTERDAM Who do you want to fight, Bill? 
Amsterdam MOTIONS toward the rear wall and Jimmy swings the cannon around. 
Everything surrounding them is MOVEMENT and COMMOTION as the remaining members of both gangs TAKE whatever weapons they can carry from the Armory stockpile... 
... and Jenny steps forward with a torch, LIGHTING the fuse of the cannon... 
... which ROARS and BLOWS a huge hole in the rear wall of the Armory. 
AMSTERDAM (to Bill the Butcher) See you in the street. 
The gang members RUSH for the opening, carrying whatever they can manage. 
Outside, the MILITIA LIEUTENANT hears the cannon blast... sees no damage to the front of the building... and SIGNALS for a frontal ASSAULT on the Armory. 
HIGH ANGLE FROM ABOVE, CAMERA MOVING as the militia CHARGES ... following them forward, then moving ahead to the Armory 
... SHOOTING straight down inside (no roof or ceiling) as the Gangs HURTLE through the still-smoldering hole in the wall ... 
... and drop twenty feet to an alley below... 
... where militia on the roof try to pick them off. As the militia presses closer from the front, gang defenses start to fall back inside the Armory. Everyone wants to get through that hole. 
Amsterdam, Jenny, Jimmy Spoils and some of the other gang nembers are carrying TORCHES. Jenny HANDS a torch to the Butcher. Amsterdam MOTIONS them all toward the back of the Armory. 
But he stays behind. Just for a moment. He BENDS over the crumpled body of Johnny Sirocco, ARRANGES it, folding JOHNNY'S HANDS across his chest. 
AMSTERDAM You'll have a warrior's funeral anyway, John. 
He STANDS and RUNS for the hole in the wall, where Jenny and the others stand waiting. 
He TURNS, takes a last look inside the Armory. The militia is BATTERING DOWN the front doors. Then he raises his TORCH over his head... and HURLS it through the air. Jenny and the others do the same. 
His single torch BLAZES a path of light across the screen. The others, JOINING it, make a fiery CONSTELLATION. 
CUT TO 
124 EXT. REAR OF ARMORY/STREETS BEHIND ARMORY DAY 
As Jenny, Jimmy Spoils, Bill the Butcher and Amsterdam HURTLE through the hole into the alley below... 
... and start to run through the withering GUNFIRE of the militia on the roof... 
... getting away... just barely away. 
As Jenny runs, her swag drops and FALLS from under her clothes. She TURNS to pick it up but Amsterdam PULLS her on.... 
... and just away from the titanic EXPLOSION of the Armory. The CONCUSSION throws some of the militia from their perches on the roof. It sends a fountain of FLAME and RUBBLE high into the sky. It is VOLCANIC in its brilliance and intensity. The sky turns BLACK with powder, BLAZING ORANGE with flame. 
In the small streets BEHIND THE ARMORY, many gang members are CRUSHED by debris or burned by FIREBALLS breaking off from the central flame. 
The Armory is gone. Much of the surrounding area is gone with it. 
On the ground, everything is smoke, flame, dirt, death, confusion, Corpses everywhere. Gang members and kids running all over, desperate. It looks like the last day of mankind on earth. 
Bill the Butcher HELPS a couple of fallen Natives, then SEES through the smoke and flame and storm of ash ... Amsterdam. Coming towards him.

DOLARHYDE (CONT'D) Where's Percy? 
NAT COLORADO Jail. Sheriff locked him up. Dolar darkens. Unsheathes a KNIFE. Looks down at Roy: 
DOLARHYDE When're these people gonna lgarn? He STABS the knife down... SLICING the rope tethered to Roy's FEET. His lower body SLUMPS to the ground, he breathes a SIGH: 
ROY CLANTON 
THANK Y-- Dolar SLAPS the horse's rump, to which Roy's UPPER TORSO is tied; it GALLOPS off, dragging a SCREAMING ROY into the night. 
DOLARHYDE Everyone saddle up. Got us a sheriff to kill. As he MOVES OFF, Dolarhyde's eyes go to the Apache Woman. Something passes between them. She seems CONCERNED. 
NAT COLORADO Wasn't the sheriff, got him caught. It was a stranger. That STOPS Dolarhyde. He turns back, face dark: 
DOLARHYDE ... What stranger? 
NAT COLORADO Usually a man gives off a scent. Where he's been. What he's done. 
(STILL SPOOKED) He didn't have one. 
OFF DOLARHYDE, EYES BURNING -- 
INT. SHERIFF TAGGART'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
A BULLET, in close up, twirling between the thumb and forefinger of SHERIFF TAGGART. Boots up on his desk, TROUBLED. Deputy Wade pours himself a cup from a TIN POT OF COFFEE: 
DEPUTY CHARLIE WADE Percy wouldn't've come in shooting without his daddy's say-so, Kyle. You best get ready for a war 'cause that's what's comin'. 
SHERIFF TAGGART Tomorrow we ride the little shit up Phoenix way, turn him over. Dolarhyde's got a beef, he can take it up with the 6th cavalry. Taggart's on his feet, grabs his JACKET off the door -- 
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Goddamn tired of this... fatass rancher scaring good people off their lan-- He STOPS. Something catches his eye on the posting board. YANKS a piece of paper off, a mixture of CONFUSION and CONCERN 
SHERIFF TAGGART (CONT'D) Sonofabitch. WHAT DOES HE SEE? Before we get a chance to KNOW -- 
EXT. SALOON - NIGHT 
EMMETT'S FACE rises into frame, peering into the saloon from below a windowsill. Sees THE MAN IN BLACK at the bar as --- 
INT. SALOON - NIGHT 
-- he SLUGS back a shot, the dog at his feet, still eyeing that steak on Atticus' plate. The Man points to his GLASS: 
THE MAN IN BLACK Another. 
MARIA You drink like a man who wants to forget. 
THE MAN IN BLACK (haunted; the irony) Other way round. The dog WHINES AGAIN for the steak. Atticus SLAMS down his silverware. Draws his GUN -- 
ATTICUS You got three seconds to get your dog outta here or I blow his balls off. 
THE MAN IN BLACK (without a blink) Not my dog. 
ATTICUS Q=... two... -- and just before "three"... CA-CLICK. Atticus FREEZES, because there's a RIFLE BARREL at the back of h,iS head now: 
VOICE (O.S.) Give you odds you don't get to 'three.' RACK TO FIND the person holding the rifle is A WOMAN. Beautiful. EXOTIC. Dressed in leather. Meet ELLA SWENSON. ON THE MAN IN BLACK. Can't help himself. immediate and undeniable CHEMISTRY. But she pays him no mind -- makes a PSST sound and the dog snaps to her side. Atticus uncocks his gun, slowly slides it back in the holster -- 
ATTICUS I was just havin' some fun, Miss -- 
ELLA Give- him, the steak. Atticus HESITATES, angry at the humiliation. Ella PRESSES THE GUN HARDER against his neck, lowering him -- and his plate -- to the floor. Right in front of the dog, who GROWLS -- 
ELLA (CONT'D) Now say you're sorry. 
ATTICUS (biting his tongue) I'm-- sorry.

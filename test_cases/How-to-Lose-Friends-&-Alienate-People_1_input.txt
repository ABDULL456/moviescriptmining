09/05/07 SHOOTING SCRIPT FADE IN: 
1 TV SCREEN - BLACK AND WHITE MOVIE 1 ...British, fifties, a melodrama. We're looking at an ACTRESS - glamorous, young - but very much in the back ground of the scene - a secretary typing at her desk. 
REVERSE A YOUNG BOY sits watching the film, his clothes and the room around him telling us this is England in the 1960s. He is staring raptly at the actress. 
SIDNEY (V.O.) All my life I've been a Looky- Loo. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
2 INT. GOLDEN GLOBES AWARDS - EVENING 2 
SLOW-MOTION We are CLOSE on an extremely handsome YOUNG MAN staring past us with a dazzling smile. 
SIDNEY (V.O.) My name's Sidney Young. I'm a journalist...a hack. (Beat) Yeah, that...that isn't me. We PAN right and down to our hero - SIDNEY YOUNG - thirties, an odd-ball with a knack for getting people to dislike him. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) This is me at the Golden Globe Awards in L.A. this year. That's my Armani tuxedo. That's a Rolex Sea-Dweller 4000 watch I'm wearing. Still in SLOW-MOTION we TRACK BACK and see that Sidney is at a table with several other people, all staring raptly past us to the stage which is out of shot. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) Those people all around me - they're all famous. They're my friends. Beside him sits a beautiful young woman - SOPHIE MAES (20's). 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) That's the actress Sophie Maes. This morning she told me she would let me have sex with her if she won the Best Actress Award. Still in SLOW MOTION, Sophie suddenly covers her face with her hands and begins to stand. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) (V.O.) (CONT'D) She just won the Best Actress Award. Sophie walks out of the shot. Still sporting the fixed smile, Sidney claps in SLO-MO along with everyone else in the room. We TRACK away from Sidney past tables of CELEBRITIES towards an EXIT. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) My life didn't used to be like this. We PUSH THROUGH the EXIT DOORS and find ourselves impossibly looking at... 
3 EXT. LONDON - LEICESTER SQUARE - LATE AFTERNOON 3 
4 SLOW MOTION TRACKING SHOT 4 ...a crowd of FANS held back from us by a red rope, craning their necks to see us more clearly, waving, cheering, shouting, cameras flashing... Rain lashes down. A CAPTION reads: "Sidney's Life, One Year Ago. Bafta Awards. London." 
SIDNEY (V.O.) Looky-Loos. That's what They call you when you stand out in the rain all night just to catch a glimpse of Them going by. REVERSE - CELEBRITIES walk down the red carpet, pausing to wave at the fans. 
SIDNEY (CONT'D) I used to pretend it was different for me because I was getting paid by a magazine or newspaper, whatever. But that's, you know...I just loved watching Them. I'd stand outside looking in through the window and think what it would be like to somehow get inside. But there was only one way to get past the thin red line that separates the celebrities from the civilians. You had to be famous. 
4A EXT. SECURITY POINT - LATE AFTERNOON 4A 
Sidney stands talking to a young PR WOMAN at the security gate. He has a small, ugly PIG on a leash. 
PR WOMAN Babe? 
SIDNEY Babe Three. Yeah. She looks doubtfully at the pig. 
PR WOMAN Babe was a cute little piglet. 
SIDNEY Harry Potter used to be a cute little piglet too. What do you want? Tempus Fugits... 
PR WOMAN He hasn't got any ID. 
SIDNEY How many pigs are coming tonight? Look, I was told to bring him, hand him over to the producer, Bob Milton, inside. You want me to leave him here with you, that's fine... 
PR WOMAN No, you can't leave him with me. I've got...Hold on, I'll... She looks around, helplessly. She begins to unhook the red rope. Sidney tries to hide his excitement. 
PR WOMAN (CONT'D) If you're positive that you're supposed to... An OLDER PR WOMAN stalks over. 
OLDER PR WOMAN 
(ICILY) Well, well, Sidney Young. 
SIDNEY 
(RUMBLED) Well, well...clipboard Nazi-type woman. She turns to the SECURITY standing beside them. 
OLDER PR WOMAN The pig doesn't get in. 
She starts to walk away. 
SIDNEY What about me?

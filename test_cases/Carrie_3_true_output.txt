And an old sleeping boar and two sows are GRADUALLY REVEALED. 
159 FULL SHOT ­ PANNING 
The face of five ­ COMING TO REST on De Lois. 
DE LOIS Doan worry, piggies, doan worry. I'm gonna bash your fuckin' heads in, and you woan have to worry `bout the bomb no more. 
BILLY Shut up and do it already. 
DE LOIS I will, I will. I'm not gonna give `em time to burp. 
BILLY The throat. 
But it's too late. De Lois has lost all conviction. 
DE LOIS I... can't. (then) You. 
He hands the sledge hammer to Billy. 
Chris, chilled to the bone, rubs herself to keep warm. 
CHRIS Do it, Billy. 
Billy touches the ball of his thumb to the edge of the sledge hammer. 
CHRIS (continuing) Do it quick. 
And Billy smiles. Yes, he actually smiles. As he raises the sledge hammer, we GO TO: 
BLACK 
FADE IN: 
160 EXT. THE WHITE HOUSE ­ AFTERNOON 
The sun is shining ­ perhaps the next day, a day later. The house is a picture postcard ­ under it, we hear the sweet, muffled sound of "Amazing Grace." It's just loud enough for us to hear it ­ joyous, triumphant. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
160A. INT. WHITE LIVING ROOM ­ AFTERNOON 
Margaret sits beneath the plaster crucifix. 
The sampler, however, sits in her lap ­ unfinished, unminded. She's virtually catatonic. 
"Amazing Grace" ­ a sweet, contemporary rendition ­ is on the Webcor. A pleasure after Kathryn Kuhlman. 
Carrie sits at the sewing machine, finishing work on the pattern for her prom dress. She removes the material from the sewing machine, which we now see is a lush crushed velvet. 
MARGARET Red. I might have known it would be red. 
The cuckoo clock is TICKING, TICKING. 
Carrie stares at Margaret, then turns the sewing machine off. She looks back at Margaret, then turns her attention to the machine, her eyes sparkling. 
Courtesy of Carrie, the treadle on the machine depresses itself. 
The needle starts to bob up and down, up and down, up and down... WHIRRING, jerking. 
The side wheel spins. And then stops. 
CARRIE (softly) Only clearing the thread, Momma. 
She smiles. Then rises and goes to start up the stairs to her room. 
Margaret looks after her. Hate. And fear. 
MARGARET (abruptly) It's Satan. 
Carrie pauses. 
CARRIE (wearily; pitying) Oh, momma. 
MARGARET He has given you a power. 
CARRIE Momma, it doesn't have anything to do with Satan. It's me. If I concentrate hard enough, I can make things move. 
MARGARET Satan is clever. 
CARRIE Momma, there are other people... people with the power... It's a part of me. 
MARGARET Satan... 
CARRIE If it were, I'd know it. 
MARGARET You poor child. He doesn't let you know he's working through you. 
CARRIE Momma, I'd know. 
MARGARET You are to renounce this power. You must give it up. You must never use it. 
CARRIE I'm going to do my homework, Momma. 
Another step up the stairs, stopping as Margaret hurls after her.

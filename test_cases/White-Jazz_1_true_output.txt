Barrel down the hallway toward Bradley's office. A habitual eye toward Junior's desk: Koenig going through his drawers. Stop. Veer toward him... 
KOENIG (formal-frosty) Your young partner called me at my home, early this morning. 
Teeth grit. Hide it. Let Koenig talk. 
KOENIG (CONT'D) Heavily inebriated. Speaking inarticulately of `betrayal,' & how the LAPD was set to be `blitzed by justice.' Is this the `bind' of which we spoke earlier? 
ME Yeah. 
KOENIG And his apartment -- there was some type of disturbance? A fire? 
ME That's why I needed his address. I was trying to help him before something like this happened. The kid snapped-in-half Fritz. He's literally lost it. (beat, deadpan) He say anything else to you? 
Koenig looks back at me. Give nothing away...one gesture that doesn't read right and he'll know. He lets more seconds pass than he should. Trying to shake me. 
KOENIG Only that he was in possession of materials that might deeply damage Chief Bradley...and yourself. 
ME Like I said Fritz, he's flipped his lid. I don't want to go to Internal Affairs but I'm afraid Junior might've forced just that. 
KOENIG Let me try to locate the lad first Dave. Be a shame to ruin such a young career so soon. 
ME Be careful Fritz. He's dangerous. 
Spin, press on toward Bradley's office. 
ME (V.O.) Fritz Koenig, the best inspector in the LAPD, digging. He'll find Junior and when he does he'll find Ainge...then Glenda... 
Reach Bradley's office, burst in. Empty. To his Secretary: 
ME Where is he? 
SECRETARY (frowns at my informality) Out at the Ravine Lieutenant. 
90   EXT. CHAVEZ RAVINE - DAY                                     90 
Park the Powerhawk. Downwind. Out. Walking. Check my Hamilton: 12:10 PM. 
ME (V.O.) Noonan's deadline lapsed ten minutes ago. An official fugitive from justice now. 
Down below, Bradley with Reuben Ruiz in-tow: glazed-fear, following him like he's handcuffed. PROTESTORS gather, placards hoisted, chants: "Dodgers, No! Mexico, Si!" The group gathers steam, supporters pack in, the chorus continues: "DODGERS NO! MEXICO SI!' 
ME (V.O.) Bradley doing damage control, the forced relocation of the Ravine's immigrants has the press in a feeding frenzy. Reuben Ruiz forced along as the token Mexican mouthpiece. 
Reporters press. Bradley handles them with ease and aplomb. 
BRADLEY -this area has long been rife with crime and venality, but with a brand new Stadium, we can make this horrible blight a bright spot and give our Los Angeles Dodgers the home they deserve. (like Ruiz was an orphan) Reuben Ruiz can tell you of his travails growing up in this horrible slum and why now is the time to `Redeem The Ravine.' 
REPORTER #2 Chief Bradley, U.S. Attorney Noonan has promised to deliver surprise witnesses before the Federal Grand jury on- 
-Bradley, this brilliant rebuke: 
BRADLEY -Welles Noonan is an unscrupulous hack politician whose smear campaign against us will fail, for he has grievously underestimated the moral rectitude of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
Then Bradley sees me. His press-friendly face contorts, the shift startling: if only a flashbulb could've framed it. He shifts back from snarl to smile... 
BRADLEY Now if you'll excuse me, I'll leave you with Reuben Ruiz. 
Ruiz begins his forced/coerced/do-it-or-we'll-fuck-you sob story as Bradley steps away from the glare. I follow. Get right on his heels. 
ME Your subpoena hasn't caught up to me yet, Chief... 
Bradley spins back. 
ME (CONT'D) (hand him Junior's file) Hurwitz Holdings. 
Bradley blanches, buckles. I see it. Before he can play stupid with: `What?' 
ME (CONT'D) You, Bethune, and Gallaudet bought big chunks of Chavez Ravine over the past two years through a shell company called Hurwitz Holdings. (beat, look around) If the Dodgers move here the value of the land booms...you could sell it off for a fortune -- or hang onto it and make even more. The parking lots alone would make you all multi-millionaires. 
Bradley removes his glasses, staring at documentation that dooms both his immediate and distant future... 
ME Word gets out that the three City Officials who were pushing hardest for a Stadium also stood to gain a mint -- might color public opinion. Might color it even more to know that the LAPD's Chief of Detectives was trying to purchase a huge tract of that land from the biggest dope dealer in town. 
Slap another file over the one he's reading. 
ME Hector Magdalena owned ten and half acres of this land. (beat, ram him) You didn't give a shit about solving his disappearance. You were worried that your real estate deal was going south. (MORE) 
ME (cont'd) That's why you wanted Tommy found, not because he was a murder suspect or you were concerned that Noonan might tap him as a federal witness...you needed him to finalize your fucking land grab. To sign paperwork in place of his dead Dad. That's why you've got Madge and Lucille in custody now. (beat) Maybe I'll let your subpoena find me now Chief, maybe I'll walk right into it...the tales I could tell.

{"train": "THE OTHER BOLEYN GIRL \nWritten by \nPeter Morgan \nBased on the novel by \nPhilippa Gregory \nFEBRUARY 2006 \nT \nEXT. FIELD - DAY We're moving through a cornfield. At speed. The sound of children's laughter. Excited shrieking. \nA beautiful young girl, (MARY BOLEYN, 8), our heroine, runs through the fields, being chased by her younger brother, GEORGE, and sister, ANNE, (10). \nTouchingly, MARY is barely taller than the corn, her head skimming along the sheaves. \nREVERSE ANGLE TO REVEAL: the children are being watched by their parents, (SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH BOLEYN). \nSIR THOMAS I received a formal request for marriage today for Anne. (a beat) From the Carey family. \nSIR THOMAS indicates to ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired. Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children. \nLADY ELIZABETH But that's wonderful. \nSIR THOMAS I turned it down. \nLADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?' \nSIR THOMAS And offered them Mary instead. \nSIR THOMAS indicates MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired. Pretty. Sweet-natured. \nSIR THOMAS Fnne's too good for William Carey. She can do (better than a merchant's son. \nLADY ELIZABETH You underestimate Mary. \nSIR THOMAS Not true. I think she's..the kinder of the two. Quite possibly the fairer. \nThe CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race.. \nSIR THOMAS But to get ahead in this world, you need more than fair looks and a kind heart. \nOn the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished. \nSIR THOMAS smiles, `See?' He walks towards ANNE.. \nSIR THOMAS (applauding his favourite) Bravo! Anne! \nEXT. BELL TOWER - TEN YEARS LATER Bells ring high up in the bell-tower of a country church. \nINT. MARY'S BEDROOM - DAY MARY, ten years older, and grown into a heavenly bride is in her room, surrounded by MAIDS and SEAMSTRESSES making final adjustments to her dress. A knock at the door. \nANNE May we come in..? \nANNE and GEORGE enter. GEORGE lets out a low whistle.. \nANNE Look at you..! Younger than me. More beautiful than me. Married before me. (a beat) I am eclipsed. I am just the `Other Boleyn Girl.' \nMARY Hardly. \nGEORGE No, is this it? This is the end of the unholy trinity? \nGEORGE extends her arms, wraps them around his two sister. An intimate moment. \nMARY No, George. Never. I'll be married, that's all.. (a beat) Apart from that - it won't change a thing. \nThe three of them hug together, tightly.. \nINT. CHAPEL - DAY A packed country church. The PRIEST officiates in Latin. The air is thick with incense. And winter cold.. \nThe entire BOLEYN FAMILY is assembled on one side. FATHER, MOTHER, the DUKE and DUCHESS of NORFOLK, brother GEORGE, and finally ANNE.. \nPRIEST Confirma hoc, Deus, quod operatus es in nobis.. \nThe PRIEST sprinkles the ring with holy water. WILLIAM CAREY, (35), puts it on MARY's finger. \nfew rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices. \nINT. BOLEYN HOME - NIGHT The party afterwards. MUSICIANS play. The bride and groom, (WILLIAM and MARY), are dancing, surrounded by WELL-WISHERS and other GUESTS.. \nWILLIAM Are you happy? \nMARY Very. \nWILLIAM You don't secretly wish you'd married someone grander? With a title? \nMARY No. I want a husband who loves me. And who thinks it first thing every morning. And last thing at night. \nWILLIAM Then you've found the right man. \nIN ANOTHER CORNER: \nANNE is dancing with her brother GEORGE. She looks up to see the NOBLEMAN who was staring at her across the church.. \nANNE Who is that? He was staring at me in church? \nGEORGE That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of Northumberland. Richest landowner in England. \nANNE's eyes widen in interest, \"Really?\" \nANNE You'll tell me everything in the morning? \nMARY I promise. \nANNE No details spared? \nThe two SISTERS hug tightly. Visibly emotional. \nThe door opens, and WILLIAM CAREY appears in the doorway. ANNE curtseys, gives MARY a last `Good luck' kiss, then goes. \nMARY stares at her husband. \nMARY Hold me a moment? \nWILLIAM CAREY envelops MARY with his arms.. \nMARY (cont'd) I'm so lucky to have a man who is content with what he has. \nMARY looks at him.. \nMARY (cont'd) You are, aren't you? \nWILLIAM CAREY smiles, looks at his gorgeous bride.. \nWILLIAM I am the luckiest man in the world. \nWILLIAM reaches for the wine.. \nWILLIAM (cont'd) Drink? \nMARY shakes her head. But WILLIAM tenderly insists.. \nWILLIAM (cont'd) You should. It will hurt less. \nMARY nervously drinks.. \nWILLIAM (cont'd) Lie back. \nMARY lies down. Then she lifts up her nightdress. WILLIAM pulls down his trousers. \nMARY extends her hands. Inviting him to join her. WILLIAM slowly lowers himself on top of her. He enters her. \nMARY smiles, in anticipation of pleasure. A side to her one might not have imagined. \nBut one or two strokes later, and WILLIAM's knuckles whiten, his face reddens, then he cries out, and slumps on top of her. \nMARY looks up. Surely that wasn't it? \nWILLIAM (cont'd) Thank you. \n(CONTINUED) \nWILLIAM rolls over. MARY stares. Soon WILLIAM snores contentedly. MARY is wide awake. Confused. \naybe this is how it's meant to be. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT. ENGLISH COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The thunder of horses' hooves. A huge cloud of dust. \nThe Royal Standard flutters in the wind. Beneath it, a SOLDIER in the KING's uniform, riding hard, dirt kicking up in his wake. \nThe SOLDIER is flanked by a dozen other of the KING's SOLDIERS, who lead a coloumn of fifty or more RIDERS.. \nIt's like an army. A legion riding into battle. But it's not, This is just the KING OF ENGLAND going away for the week-end. \nBehind the advance party, is the KING himself, (30's), handsome, in his prime, surrounded by a dozen or so of his closest COURTIERS, (among them the DUKE of NORFOLK), a grand, tough, intimidating lot. \nBehind them, comes the KING's CONFESSOR, a Priest with a large ornate crucifix, a small library of religious books.. \nThen, in a riot of colour, come the MUSICIANS, the FOOL and the PLAYERS, led by the MASTER of the REVELS. \nBehind them, come the SQUIRES and PAGES, carrying the King's weapons, his jousting kit, his swords, his armour, his lance, etc. \nThen come the animals: FALCONS, in cages, and the HUNTING HOUNDS, beagles and pinchers, barking in excitement, and an assortment of FRESH HORSES for travelling, and hunting. \nAnd finally, bringing up the rear, another unit of ARMED GUARDS, and a second STANDARD BEARER.. \nEXT. HEVER - DAY The BOLEYN family page, (WILLIAM STAFFORD), is perched on a hill. Keeping watch. Staring into the distance.. \nPresently, he sees clouds of dust and the sound of thunder approaching. His expression changes... \nEXT. HEVER - ESTATE - DAY Pandemonium breaks out among STAFF and FAMILY MEMBERS as STAFFORD calls out, \"The King!\" \nINT. HEVER - DAY ANNE is being dressed by MAIDS. Hearing the commotion outside, she rushes over to the window to see the approaching RIDERS. \nANNE looks out of the window. Scans the approaching RIDERS until she finds the KING.. \nANNE There he is! \nThe young HENRY TUDOR is a dazzling, magnetic, intensely glamorous and handsome figure. A total contrast from the bloated, bearded figure of his later years. \nANNE You think he will like me? \nMARY Of course, sister. How could he not? \nANNE turns to face MARY. The two SISTERS embrace tightly. \nEXT. HEVER - DAY The entire BOLEYN FAMILY is nervously assembled outside the house, (which we notice has been transformed at great cost. Huge marquees in the gardens. Fountains. Additional staff. Smart uniforms. New extensions to the stables and kitchens). \nMARY is discreetly hidden, among the CROWDS. ANNE is pride of place. Visibly nervous. SIR THOMAS and LADY ELIZABETH are beside her. The proud PARENTS. \nEveryone bows deeply in deference as the King arrives. \nLATER: dinner is served. Everyone is eating. HENRY and several close COURTIERS are engaged in debate.. \nHENRY ..I had it from the lips of the Spanish ambassador himself. That our musicians are the envy of all Europe. \nBRANDON ..then he was flattering you, your Grace. \nHENRY Our Universities and philosophers, too. \n(CONTINUED) \nH \nB \nBRANDON ...another lie. That honour would have to go to the Germans. \nHENRY What of our painters, then? \nRANDON Years behind their Italian counterparts. The truth is far from leading the world, we're a provincial outpost, lagging far behind. \nHENRY What? Is no one proud to be English? (turns to ANNE) Anne? What say you? \nANNE gulps. The clanking of cutlery. All eyes on her. \nANNE Me, my Lord? clears throat) I know little of such matters, but I've not heard mention of our armies. Undefeated, I believe, in a generation. \nENRY Well said. \nANNE Or our navy? The finest in the world. \nHENRY It's true. \nANNE The universities in Spain and the philosophers in Germany may be strong, but are they really the equal of Oxford and Thomas More? \nHENRY Never! \nANNE I doubt there is a country that is fairer in Government, or better protected by nature from her enemies, whose people are happier or more prosperous.. \nHENRY She's right, by God! She's right! \nHENRY is delighted. SIR THOMAS stares proudly across the room at ANNE. Who's hand, we notice, is shaking. \n(CONTINUED) \nA \nI \nT \nS \nHer heart pounding in her chest. \nINT. STAIRCASE - BOLEYN HOUSE - NIGHT SIR THOMAS stops ANNE on her way upstairs. \nSIR THOMAS You did well tonight. Very well. Quite enough to be invited to court, I am sure of it. \nSIR THOMAS kisses ANNE's forehead.. \nSIR THOMAS Now go to bed. Get a good night's sleep. Because there's still the hunt tomorrow. a beat) You must excel at that. \nSIR THOMAS watches ANNE go. Admiring her. Then he turns to see his wife, ELIZABETH. She turns away in disgust. \nINT. GIRLS' BEDROOM - NIGHT MARY and ANNE lie together. In spoons position. ANNE is fast asleep. MARY strokes her sister's hair. Eyes open. \nwo vulnerable, young children. \nEXT. HEVER CASTLE - STABLE YARD - DAY \nThe following morning.. \nThirty or more RIDERS, STABLE-BOYS and HORSES are gathered. To one side, a deafening pack of DEER-HOUNDS, (wire-haired Lurchers), barking frantically. \nt's a scene of great activity, excitement, and anticipation. \nThe MASTER OF THE HORSE helps HENRY mount his steed - the biggest and most glamorous stallion of all, with wonderful, ornate saddlery. \nnumber of OTHER LADIES are also going hunting, and we notice they ride pillion, (ie), riding on the same horse as their MEN, sitting behind them, holding onto them.. F inally, ANNE comes out. The KING turns.. \nHENRY Good morning, Anne. \nANNE curtseys deeply.. \n(CONTINUED) \nH \nB \nA \nW \nANNE Good morning, your Grace. \nHENRY ho will you be riding with? \nIt's clearly an invitation. He indicates there is room for ANNE on the back of his saddle. But ANNE fails to read the signal. \nANNE On my own your Grace. \nHENRY Your own..? \n(CONTINUED) \nA \nH \nT \nH \nT \nA \nShe made it! Exhilarated, ANNE turns, breathing hard. The KING stares at her. The COURTIERS stare at her. \nlong silence. Nothing but the sound of wind in the trees.. \nCOURTIER Please, your Majesty. It's not safe. \nHENRY turns and stares daggers at the COURTIER, `Silence'. He stares across the ravine at ANNE. Their eyes meet. \nhen he kicks his horse, `Hah!', and lurches forward. He heads down the sheer ravine. The COURTIERS gasp, rush to the edge of the ravine to watch. ANNE goes to the edge her side. \nENRY's horse slides perilously down the ravine, then struggles to clear the brook, and lands heavily in the water. \nhe KING struggles to keep control, and as the horse tries to scramble up the bank the other side, it loses it's footing in T the mud, it's hooves grasping horrifically at air.. \nhe COURTIERS cry out in horror, ANNE covers her mouth as.. \nThe KING's horse falls backwards, unseating HENRY, sending him flying, and worst of all, landing on top of him as they fall and tumble dreadfully down into the brook, and onto the rocks.. \nPandemonium breaks out. The sound of shouting voices, cries of horror, raising the alarm. \nANNE's FACE: what has she done? \nINT. HEVER - NIGHT HENRY slowly comes to, to find himself staring at a number of faces. A PHYSICIAN, SIR THOMAS BOLEYN, the DUKE of NORFOLK, one or two COURTIERS, and finally, ANNE.. \nPHYSICIAN It's a miracle, Majesty, you have no broken bones.. \nHENRY flinches in agony, tries to move.. \nSIR THOMAS My daughter Anne is here. Would like to apologise. \nENRY (recoils, his pride hurt) No! Get her away from me! \nANNE opens her mouth, wants to protest, but is hastily ushered out of the room. \n(CONTINUED) \nH \nLATER: HENRY's wound is being dressed by MARY. \nHENRY And who are you? \nMARY Mary, your Grace. Anne's younger sister. \nHENRY looks her up and down.. \nHENRY You've been here all week-end? \nMARY Yes, your Grace. \nHENRY Really? How could I have overlooked you? \nMARY Next to Anne, it's easy to do. \nHENRY Nonsense. \nHENRY sits up, takes H better look. Intrigued. a \nENRY (cont'd) Tell me about yourself. You're married? \nMARY Yes, your Grace. To William Carey. \nENRY From Wolsey's office? \nMARY Yes, your Grace. \nHENRY Then why haven't I seen you at court? \nMARY Because I have persuaded him to spend a year or two here first. We have a small manor and some land. Nothing much. But enough to start a family. \nHENRY A charmed life in the country? Away from it all? \nMARY Yes. \n(CONTINUED) \nM \nHENRY Everything I would have wished for myself. But then my brother died. a beat) And duty called. \nHENRY looks at MARY, then.. \nHENRY You don't think he'll miss court? a beat) A young, ambitious man? \nMARY He says not, your Majesty. \nMARY lowers her eyes.. \nMARY But, if he ever changed his mind, I would always support him. \nY \nM \nM \nI \nANNE storms out. GEORGE shoots MARY a look, \"I'll deal with this\", and runs after ANNE.. \nOVER THIS: we fade in MUSIC and the sound of laughter.. \nINT. BALL-ROOM - PALACE - NIGHT A grand MASQUE BALL. We're in a spectacular candle-lit ballroom. MUSICIANS play. Large formations of DANCERS perform elaborately choreographed moves. Among them we pick out.. \nSIR THOMAS BOLEYN stalking the party. Ever watchful. On duty. Vigilant. He is distracted by the sight of... \nHis son, GEORGE BOLEYN, surrounded by FRANCIS WESTON and his FRIENDS. GEORGE is clearly in his element. Laughing in delight. Very fond and intimate with FRANCIS WESTON.. \nSIR THOMAS looks concerned for the first time. \nn another corner, MARY is in costume, but looking forlorn. She watches proceedings with a blank, distant expression. Presently, a voice behind her.. \nMASKED MAN Why look so glum, Mary? \nMARY turns to see a MASKED MAN behind her. \nMARY What reason have I to be happy? \nMASKED MAN ou have two men, the King of England and I, both fighting for your love. \nThe MASKED MAN is tall. His voice is quiet, but strong. \nMARY Do I know you? \nMASKED MAN You know me, Mary - but not half as well as I know you. I know you better than anyone here. And love you better than anyone here, too. And if God had made ME your husband instead of William Carey, one thing I know.. (a beat) I would never have let you go. \nMARY's smile fades.. \nMARY Wait! Who ARE you? \n(CONTINUED) \nN \nB             M \nM \nY \nI \nM M \nMARY lunges for the MAN's MASK to try and remove it, but the MAN retreats into the safety of the shadows. Meanwhile.. \nAll around MARY the crowds part, and a deep voice booms out. \nASKED MAN #2 Ah! Who have we here?!? \nMARY turns to see a SECOND MASKED MAN, (unmistakably the KING), surrounded by COURTIERS. M MARY My name is Kindness. \nMASKED MAN #2 wonder, will you be kind to me? \nMARY What is it you desire? \nMASKED MAN #2 our love, fair Lady. \nMARY You demand a great deal. \nMASKED MAN #2 No more than I would give in return. \nMARY notices her FATHER is among the masked COURTIERS. His eyes giving MARY cues.. \nMARY It is easy for a man to declare love from behind a mask. \nASKED MAN #2 ut if I remove it, you might reject me. \nMARY If your feelings were sincere, I would never reject you. \nMASKED MAN #2 But you do not know who I am? I could be ugly. Or poor. \nMARY o matter how you looked. Or who you were. \nMASKED MAN #2 Really? Then I shall hold you to your word. And unmask..! \nWith a flourish, the KING rips off his mask.. \n(CONTINUED) \nH \nM \nH \nS \nMARY Your Majesty..! \nSIR THOMAS urgently nods, `Go on!' MARY theatrically swoons. Falling into the KING's arms. A gasp among the COURTIERS.. \nHENRY he faints! Quick! Take her to my rooms! Call my physicians..! \nS \nI \nH \nHENRY Do you not know what it is to be lonely in a marriage? \nMARY Yes. I do now. \nENRY married my brother's widow because my father ordered it. As a duty. To keep the alliance with Spain. And she is a remarkable woman. And wife. \nHENRY looks at MARY.. \nHENRY But I never looked at her or longed for her the way I do you. \nHENRY reaches out. Their hands meet.. \nHENRY Imagine how different it might have been. For both of us..had we been able to chose for ourselves.. \nHENRY leans forward and they kiss. Gently at first. MARY resisting. Then harder.. \nensing this, the KING picks MARY up and leads her to the canopied bed, and lays her down.. \nThey begin to make love. As radical a contrast to the scene with WILLIAM CAREY as it is possible to imagine.. \nMARY's eyes open. She gasps. Her hands grip the sheets.. \nINT. PALACE - DAYBREAK HENRY and MARY, entwined in one another's arms, as the sun rises... \nINT. CORRIDOR - OUTSIDE HENRY'S APARTMENTS - DAY Several hours later: \nWILLIAM STAFFORD is fast asleep in a window seat in the corridor outside. Finally, the door opens. And MARY emerges from the KING's apartment. \nTAFFORD Good morning. S TAFFORD jumps to his feet. Waking rapidly.. \n(CONTINUED) \nM \nSTAFFORD I have orders to bring you to your father. \nMARY stares at STAFFORD. As he straightens his shirt.. \nMARY My father..? a beat) Well, we'd better not keep him waiting. \nSTAFFORD turns, leads the way. MARY follows. \nINT. NORFOLK'S STUDY - COURT - DAY The DUKE of NORFOLK's dogs are eating breakfast out of bowls by the fire. Slurping hungrily. \nThe entire family is gathered. SIR THOMAS, LADY ELIZABETH. Also present is WILLIAM CAREY. \nNORFOLK Well..? \nMARY stares at her husband.. \nNORFOLK Did he have you? \nMARY's eyes burn.. \nMARY Yes. \nNORFOLK More than once? \nMARY stares daggers.. \nNORFOLK You'd better get used to talking about it. Once you sleep with the king, it's not a private matter any more. \nMARY Yes. More than once. \nWILLIAM CAREY's face: a flicker of pain.. \nNORFOLK So he was satisfied? \nMARY I believe so, Uncle. \n(CONTINUED) \nB \nG \nNORFOLK ood. This is where our work begins. It's one thing to catch the king. Quite another to keep him. \nNORFOLK turns to SIR THOMAS, ignoring MARY as though she were a piece of livestock.. \nNORFOLK I want you to keep her spotless, hair washed every day. She must read all the latest books and be able to venture and defend an interesting opinion. She must know her music, must be energetic and entertaining - in company and in bed. That's how he likes his women. And if ever she's in any doubt as to how to conduct herself, or what to do next - she should simply watch the Queen. That woman kept him from straying for eleven years. And the effort almost killed her. \nut SIR THOMAS has not heard. He is distracted. He watches from a palace window as, in a stableyard down below.. \nGEORGE and FRANCIS WESTON return from riding together. The sound of laughter as they dismount, and hand their horses to the stable-boys.. \nSIR THOMAS watches as GEORGE and FRANCIS walk back to the palace together. There's something in their manner, the intimacy between them.. \nSIR THOMAS's smile fades. \nINT. PALACE - DAY `Slap', HENRY spreads out a huge architect's drawing of a magnificent ship on a table. He sits with SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and the DUKE of NORFOLK. \nHENRY The biggest warship in the fleet. Thirty- two guns and two hundred feet long, and with your permission Thomas.. (We notice SIR THOMAS's clothes have become more expensive, grander) ..I'd like to name her after your daughter. The \"Mary Boleyn\". \nSIR THOMAS looks up in disbelief.. \nSIR THOMAS Majesty! I'm...I'm speechless.. \nLADY ELIZABETH What's to smile about? I'm a mother with one child on his wedding day looking like he's been condemned to death. \nhe indicates GEORGE, who dances with JANE PARKER.. \nLADY ELIZABETH Another banished abroad, in disgrace. And a third whoring in public with an adulterer. \nSIR THOMAS For the moment she's happy. \nSIR THOMAS watches MARY who dances with the KING.. \nLADY ELIZABETH But will she be happy when he leaves her? Because you know that's how it will end. \nSIR THOMAS Only God knows how anything will end. \nLADY ELIZABETH God..? He turned his back on all this a long time ago. \nSIR THOMAS stares coldly at his wife. He applauds as the dance comes to an end. \n(CONTINUED) \nW \nM \nW \nM \nW \nIN ANOTHER CORNER: \nMARY and the KING also clap. HENRY whispers sexily in MARY's ear. She laughs. Then HENRY is called to one side... \nMARY is momentarily left alone. She looks up to see WILLIAM CAREY standing in front of her, swaying slightly. \nWILLIAM You're in love with him, aren't you? \nMARY illiam, you're drunk. \nWILLIAM How is it? With him? \nMARY stares - suddenly hard - punishing him. \nMARY He pleases me. Is that what you want to hear? \nWILLIAM What does he do to you? Tell me. I want to know.. \nMARY pulls away. But CAREY pulls her roughly to one side. HENRY sees this from across the room.. \nWILLIAM I know you look at me with contempt. But I had no choice. Your father insisted I stand aside. What was I expected to do? \nMARY Say `no', husband. (a beat) That was all you had to do. \nMARY pulls her arm away, and goes. She walks across the room, visibly shaken, and joins the KING. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY HENRY and MARY make love. Two people giving everything of themselves.. \nHours later: they lie together, enveloped in one another's arms. MARY is awake. The King asleep in her arms. She lovingly strokes his hair. Watches him breathe. \nHer face is glowing. Content. And the look in her eyes tells us more eloquently and unequivocally than any sonnet.. \n(CONTINUED) \nI \nM \n...that she has fallen in love. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT. MARY'S APARTMENT - COURT - DAY The sound of groaning. Wretching. Shooting through a half-open door, we see MARY hunched over her basin, vomiting. P resently, she emerges from the bathroom. White-faced. Her hands instinctively covering her belly. \nMARY's eyes widen with the implications. \nINT. KING'S APARTMENT - DAY SIR THOMAS BOLEYN and the DUKE of NORFOLK stare at MARY. Also present are several PHYSICIANS and GEORGE BOLEYN.. \nSIR THOMAS Are you certain? \nMARY Yes. \nSIR THOMAS looks at the PHYSICIAN, who nods.. \nSIR THOMAS n that case...I suppose...someone should tell the King. \nINT. HENRY'S APARTMENT - DAY Shooting through a half-open door.. \nSIR THOMAS and the DUKE of NORFOLK are having a private audience with the KING. SIR THOMAS whispers something in HENRY's ear.. \n(WE DO NOT HEAR THE WORDS - WE DO NOT NEED TO). \nHENRY's face breaks out in a smile. He delightedly shakes SIR THOMAS's hand. OVER THIS: the sound of a voice.. \nSIR THOMAS (O.S.) Keep them shut...still shut.. \nINT. COURT - ACCOMMODATION - DAY A blindfolded MARY is led through doors by SIR THOMAS..into a suite of grand, unfurnished rooms, the most prestigious accommodation at court.. \n(CONTINUED) \nL \nG \n(CONTINUED) \nF \nShe has been well trained. \nBut she makes no impact on HENRY. He waves the SEYMOURS away. Not remotely interested. \nor the moment. \nINT. MARY'S ROOM - LYING-IN - EVENING The KING is visiting MARY. He sits by her bed. They hold hands and are talking intimately. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL: \nThis is being watched by the DUKE of NORFOLK, and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. NORFOLK's face is dark and brooding.. \nNORFOLK For the moment he's still visiting Mary. But for how long? The Queen will soon have his head spinning with pretty little Spanish things. Not to mention the Seymours with that girl of theirs. \nNORFOLK looks up... \nNORFOLK What we need is someone from OUR family who will keep the King focused on Mary, reminding him of her while she is absent. \nSIR THOMAS is about to speak, then changes his mind. \nNORFOLK What? Speak.. \nSIR THOMAS It's just...I was going to suggest Anne. \nNORFOLK You couldn't control that girl last time. What makes you think it would be any different now? \nSIR THOMAS I've had favourable reports from the Dowager Queen in France. It seems she is quite changed. \nINT. MARY'S APARTMENT - DAY MARY sits up. Her eyes widen in horror.. \n(CONTINUED) \nH \nM \nMARY Why? \nSitting beside her in the darkness, is her brother GEORGE.. \nGEORGE I suppose they felt three years of exile was punishment enough. \nMARY But the King visits me every day. There's no need for her. Or anyone else. \nGEORGE They just want to protect you. Leave nothing to chance. \nMARY But in who's interests do they imagine Anne will act? Certainly not mine. \nGEORGE turns, looks all around him.. \nGEORGE (cont'd) Why DO they make this room such a dungeon? Does it really need to be this dark? \nGEORGE notices MARY's vexed expression.. \nGEORGE Don't worry. She's had three years to forgive you. And she's not going to risk being sent away again. She'll do as she's told, I'm sure. (a beat) Besides, the most important thing is.. \nGEORGE moves MARY's lips into an upward shape.. \nGEORGE The three of us will be together again. \nMARY's lips: a reluctant, unconvincing smile.. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT. KENT COUNTRYSIDE - COAST - DAY The thunder of galloping horses. \nalf a dozen RIDERS, among them a HOODED WOMAN, riding side- saddle, tearing across the countryside.. \nP \nEXT.

COUNTRYSIDE - NIGHT The RIDERS and the WOMAN ride in silhouette against a perfect full moon.. \nEXT. COUNTRYSIDE - DAY HENRY and several of his COURTIERS return from a hunting trip. Several dead STAGS are carried on horseback. The atmosphere is celebratory. It's been a good day. \nDogs bark in excitement. \nINT. GREENWICH PALACE - THAT NIGHT A dinner at court. HENRY is at one end, in serious conversation with foreign AMBASSADORS. Presently, at the other end of the table, loud laughter. H ENRY looks up, then returns to his conversation. \nIt's not long before another loud gale of laughter in the corner of the room. HENRY looks up again. Then returns to his conversation. \nresently, a third roar of laughter at the other end. This time, HENRY loses patience.. \nHENRY What's the noise? I can hardly hear myself think! \nAt the other end, a COURTIER gets to his feet.. \nBRANDON It's Mistress Boleyn, your Majesty. Her stories about life at the French court. They are particularly amusing. \nHENRY's expression changes. The room falls silent.. \nHENRY I'm only aware of one Boleyn girl and she is lying-in with a certain child in her belly! \n(CONTINUED) \nA \nMARY Or HER, you mean. \nSIR THOMAS What? \nMARY 'm wary of any suggestion that Anne would serve anyone but herself. France can't have changed her THAT much. \nSIR THOMAS n this occasion I am quite satisfied she was being loyal to you. \nMARY Really? \nMARY stares hollow-eyed.. \nMARY (cont'd) Then ask yourself this. If she is really so concerned for my well-being... (a beat) (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nH \nH \n...then why hasRY(conot dcome to see me MA she nt' ) since she returned? \nEXT.

ARMOURY - DAY AFTERWARDS: HENRY and his COURTIERS, (among them GEORGE), are being undressed and washed by their PAGES and SQUIRES.. \nHENRY You're a fortunate man, George. To be blessed with G two such sisters. \nEORGE Yes, my Lord. \nThere is a powerful physicality, a sexual confidence to HENRY which he exudes, even among men. He moves closer to GEORGE. \nENRY Tell me. Are they as different in temper as they are in looks? \nGEORGE Oh, yes. Each has her own, quite distinct virtues. Mary for example.. \nHENRY I'm familiar with Mary's. Tell me about Anne's. \nGEORGE Anne? Well, she's strong. Some might say `difficult'. \nENRY Headstrong. With a fiery temper. \nGEORGE But with it comes great passion, too. It's both the best and the worst thing about her. a beat) There are no half measures with Anne. \nHENRY Careful, you'll make me think I chose the wrong Boleyn girl. \n(CONTINUED) \nA \nS \n8           A \nGEORGE Oh, no. I'm certain Mary is the   right choice. You will have a serene,   happy, life with her. The risk is with   Anne, it might be like being caught in a   wild summer storm. \nHENRY Is that so..? \nGEORGE has tried to put HENRY off. But might just have said the wrong thing. \nHENRY storm, you say..? \nINT. BOLEYN APARTMENTS - COURT - FOLLOWING DAY A small, precious-looking GIFT BOX sits on a table. \nERVANT From the King, madam. \nANNE looks at the box. Her heart misses a beat. It carries the unmistakable royal seal. \nANNE Open it. \nA SERVANT stares.. \nANNE I said `open it.' \nThe SERVANT opens it. Other SERVANTS crane their necks, stand on tiptoes. Inside is a large pearl pendant. The SERVANT gasps. ANNE, too. Covers her mouth. It's beautiful.. \nBut from somewhere, she manages to find the strength.. \nANNE Now close it again. And send it back. \nThe SERVANT stares in disbelief.. \nANNE (cont'd) You heard me. \nThe SERVANT bows, and leaves, taking the box. ANNE watches, a look of mischief in her eyes.

PHYSICIANS use rusty, blood-stained instruments.. \nPresently: the KING arrives with several COURTIERS.. \nSIR THOMAS Any moment, your Grace. \nBut the KING hasn't heard. He has seen ANNE.

His eyes are full of conflict, then..he silently nods. \nANNE's face breaks out in a smile.. \nANNE Very well. \nThen, in front of everyone, not caring how inappropriate it is, HENRY falls to his knee, takes ANNE's hand and kisses it. \nThe audible sound of gasps.

HENRY kisses ANNE) Which leaves you all alone at court.. \nHe begins to unbutton her dress.. \nHENRY ...queen in all but name. Mother to any future heir. \nENRY unbuttons and kisses lower, lower. \nHENRY So, is this assurance enough? Will you give yourself to me now? \nA flicker behind ANNE's eyes, then.. \nANNE I'd like to.

Well, I shall not. You want me to lie before God and admit my first marriage was consummated? Well, it was not. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nYOUNG HENRY (cont'd) Is that sword real? \nHENRY I think so. Would you like to see it? \nHENRY draws it, and shows the boy, who's eyes widen in excitement.. \nHENRY Now, `on guard'. \nHENRY and YOUNG HENRY begin to play fight.

I have my own plans, which don't involve becoming a rag that will one day be discarded. \nMARY stares, saddened, `Oh, Anne', but there's no time to talk. She has to go. ANNE is left. Her eyes blazing. \nEXT. PALACE - DAY MARY and WILLIAM ride through London streets escorted by SERVANTS bringing their belongings. They approach Whitehall Palace. Armed GUARDS slowly open the gates. \nMARY's face: as the heavy gates open. She shoots a last look at the `free' world outside. Then, she rides through the Palace gates. \n`CLANK', the heavy doors shut behind her. \nThe outside world has been totally sealed off. Faces appear at palace windows, staring down at the `new arrivals'. \nmong them: is HENRY himself. He stares out of the window. Sees MARY. Then he lets the curtain fall. \nINT. COURT - DAY KATHERINE of ARAGON, (late-30's), imperious, intimidating, Spanish. Surrounded by other LADIES IN WAITING, (mostly high- born, Spanish, and the QUEEN's age).

It's school bullying. \nQUEEN KATHERINE Well, then she must be some kind of gift. He must have seen in her some special talent that would please me. Tell me.

A formidable adversary. \nQUEEN KATHERINE Bravo! A nightingale! (the cruel satisfaction of victory) Welcome at court! \nINT. CORRIDORS - WHITEHALL PALACE - AFTERNOON MARY walks through the packed corridors of court, her face burning from the humiliation. The sound of a voice behind her.. \nWOMAN'S VOICE ait! Mary! Stop! \nBut MARY does not hear. She continues walking, distressed, and distractedly enters.. \nFinally, she is caught by JANE PARKER, whom we had seen at the window earlier. Younger, also English, a kindred spirit.. \nJANE I know that must have been agony, but put yourself in her shoes. She knows the only reason the King has asked you here is because he desires you. For a wife that must be very difficult. a beat) She's a good woman. Trust me. \nJANE smiles. MARY manages a smile..

MARY is with GEORGE, who is putting on his armour.. \nGEORGE Not noticed her? Jane Parker? Of course I have. How could I not? She looks like a goat. \nMARY Well, she likes you, and asked me to give you this..to remember her by. \nMARY hands over a handkerchief.. \nGEORGE Ugh. Well say you haven't seen me. Or that you forgot. \nGEORGE hastily gives it back.. \nGEORGE (cont'd) There is something about that woman that makes me feel...

You know she took being upstaged by you very badly. \nMARY Yes, I know. \nGEORGE And no amount of interventions on my behalf would make her believe you hadn't done it intentionally. \nMARY But you KNOW I would never do anything like that. \nGEORGE I know. \nGEORGE finds his helmet, puts it on.. \nGEORGE (cont'd) Just give her time. She'll come round. \nMARY watches GEORGE go to join the other MALE COURTIERS. \nINT. MARY'S ROOM - COURT - DAY MARY enters her room, and closes the door. She begins undressing, taking off her clothes, then catches sight of a DOG in the shadows. She gasps. It's the KING's dog. \nHENRY (O.S.) Please, don't be alarmed. \nENRY steps out of the shadows.. \nMARY covers herself in modesty, and falls to her knees in a deep curtsey of deference. HENRY steps into the light, walks towards her..                H ENRY I wanted to find somewhere we could be alone so I might say a few words to you in person. \nENRY turns, looks around the room.. \nHENRY I hope your accommodation is comfortable.

The KING's eyes, however, instead of staring at MARY's beautiful, exposed body, stay focused on her eyes. An uncomfortable moment.. \nHENRY I am sorry. (delicately putting her clothes back on MARY) You obviously misunderstand me. \nHENRY bows in respect, then turns, and takes his leave, leaving MARY standing in the room.. \nINT. NORFOLK'S STUDY - COURT - NIGHT The DUKE of NORFOLK stares in disbelief at MARY. His dogs lie intimidatingly at his feet. \nNORFOLK What? If all the King wanted was coition, he could fetch in a woman from the bath house. a beat) What he wants is YOU. a beat) To woo you. And be wooed in return. (a beat) And could'nt you look just a little happier? There isn't a girl in the Kingdom that wouldn't wish to be in your shoes. \nMARY Your opinion, Uncle. \nMARY speaks quietly. Lowers her head.. \nMARY Mine is that it's the greatest insult of all. \nORFOLK What? \nMARY Asking a whore to have feelings, too. \nWE'RE INTO A BRIEF MONTAGE: \nF \nT \nA \nT \nINT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY An incense-filled Royal Chapel. The ARCHBISHOP is giving mass, in Latin, for the Royal Household. \nhe King sits at the front, on the left. With the men. The ladies are separated, as is traditional, and sit on the right. \nHENRY is lost in prayer. It's not long, however, before he turns to look at MARY. \nEXT. COUNTRY CHAPEL - DAY Meanwhile, a remote country parish church. Far away. \nlocal PRIEST arrives. He sees two HORSES tethered to a tree by the side of the church. He dismounts. Checks no one has followed him. \nhen he enters the church. \nINT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY In the Royal chapel: the ARCHBISHOP solemnly performs the Eucharist, breaking bread and making wine from blood.. \nBut, in full view of all those in the chapel, the KING continues to stare at MARY. \ninally, she looks up. Their eyes meet. MARY blushes, averts her gaze. But then, for the first time, she reciprocates. And looks back. \nThis is witnessed by the QUEEN, and further back, by the DUKE of NORFOLK and SIR THOMAS BOLEYN. \nEveryone is pretending to focus on the MASS. But none of them can concentrate.. \nINT. COUNTRY CHURCH - DAY In the country church: The PRIEST's eyes become accustomed to the dark. Everywhere, long shadows, eerie darkness.. \nPRIEST Are you there? \nPresently, a WOMAN steps into the light. It's ANNE.

Is he here? \nUp ahead, the GROOM slowly steps out of the shadows. Now we see his face. It's HENRY PERCY. \nRIEST Good. Then let us begin. \nEXT. ROYAL CHAPEL - DAY Back at court: the service ends. \nEveryone in the Royal Household filters out of the church. But it's a very different atmosphere to when they entered.. \nThe extent of HENRY's affection for MARY is now public knowledge evidenced by.. \n..the attention SIR THOMAS and NORFOLK now receive from CARDINAL WOLSEY and THOMAS CROMWELL, and the way in which QUEEN KATHERINE and her SPANISH LADIES are being neglected. \nMARY allows herself a private smile of satisfaction. Surprised at how good it feels. To be the number 1. \nINT. MARY'S ROOM - NIGHT MARY lies in bed, in a room covered in flowers. She admires a beautiful necklace in a box, and a handwritten letter from the KING. We can see from MARY's face how much she likes it. \nPresently, urgent `knock', `knock', at the door. MARY's eyes widen in excitement. The King? \nShe hurriedly closes the necklace's box. Tucks the letter away in a drawer. \nShe gets out of bed.

Forever. \nANNE But you cannot undo what has been done before God. (defiant stare) And consummated too. \n`Snap', NORFOLK's quill breaks. SIR THOMAS almost chokes.

And stay there until your father has forgiven you. \nANNE goes. GEORGE follows.. \nINT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE - DAY MARY paces anxiously in the corridor. Presently, ANNE emerges from the room.

GREAT COURT - TOWER OF LONDON - DAY ANNE is led into a great courtroom lit by flickering torches, and filled with fifty or sixty of the country's most powerful NOBLEMEN. ANNE walks to the centre of the room, surveying her `jurors', noting that they have remained seated.. \nANNE It is a sad day for England when the nobles do not rise for their Queen. \nNORFOLK And even sadder when that same Queen is charged with adultery and incest. \nANNE Charged is different to convicted, Uncle.

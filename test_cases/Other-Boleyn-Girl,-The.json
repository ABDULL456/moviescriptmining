(a beat) From the Carey family. \nSIR THOMAS indicates to ANNE; the eldest. Dark-haired. Intelligent. The obvious leader among the children. \nLADY ELIZABETH But that's wonderful. \nSIR THOMAS I turned it down. \nLADY ELIZABETH turns...`What?' \nSIR THOMAS And offered them Mary instead. \nSIR THOMAS indicates MARY, the middle child. Fair-haired. Pretty. Sweet-natured. \nSIR THOMAS Fnne's too good for William Carey. She can do (better than a merchant's son. \nLADY ELIZABETH You underestimate Mary. \nSIR THOMAS Not true. I think she's..the kinder of the two. Quite possibly the fairer. \nThe CHILDREN, meanwhile, have started a race.. \nSIR THOMAS But to get ahead in this world, you need more than fair looks and a kind heart. \nOn the field, ANNE wins. She jumps up and down, holding her arms aloft, as MARY flops to the floor. Vanquished. \nSIR THOMAS smiles, `See?' He walks towards ANNE.. \nSIR THOMAS (applauding his favourite) Bravo! Anne! \nEXT.

WILLIAM CAREY, (35), puts it on MARY's finger. \nfew rows back, a young NOBLEMAN stares at ANNE. Looks at her across the church. Obviously attracted. ANNE notices. \nINT. BOLEYN HOME - NIGHT The party afterwards. MUSICIANS play. The bride and groom, (WILLIAM and MARY), are dancing, surrounded by WELL-WISHERS and other GUESTS.. \nWILLIAM Are you happy? \nMARY Very. \nWILLIAM You don't secretly wish you'd married someone grander?

And last thing at night. \nWILLIAM Then you've found the right man. \nIN ANOTHER CORNER: \nANNE is dancing with her brother GEORGE. She looks up to see the NOBLEMAN who was staring at her across the church.. \nANNE Who is that? He was staring at me in church? \nGEORGE That's Henry Percy. Heir to the Duke of Northumberland.

A week-end's hunting in late summer. \nSIR THOMAS But that's wonderful! Thank you, thank you so much.. (he turns to ELIZABETH) Did you hear that, Elizabeth? \nLADY ELIZABETH (hates the idea) Yes. \nSIR THOMAS Finally we can present George, and with luck, get him a position at court. \nLADY ELIZABETH excuses herself, and leaves.. \nNORFOLK These are difficult times. I have it on good authority that the Queen no longer bleeds - yet the matter of a male heir is still not resolved. a beat) It cannot be long before the King is forced to look outside the marriage. \n(CONTINUED) \nSIR THOMAS What? And make a bastard King of England? \nNORFOLK A legitimized bastard. What choice does he have? (a beat) Obviously, I've given it thought, and wondered which Howard girl I could put under his nose. Imagine the influence that would give us. To be blood family of the next King of England. Equally, imagine if another family were to achieve the same? \nNORFOLK indicates SIR JOHN SEYMOUR in the corner, and his two loathsome, ambitious sons EDWARD and THOMAS.. \nSIR THOMAS What about Anne? \nSIR THOMAS turns, and indicates ANNE across the crowds, who's dancing with GEORGE... \nSIR THOMAS I realise as a `Boleyn' she is not officially a `Howard', but as your sister's daughter.. \nNORFOLK But she's your eldest, Thomas. Your first born. And your favourite. Wouldn't you prefer her to have a nice, uncomplicated, respectable marriage? Like Mary? \nSIR THOMAS If Anne were an uncomplicated, respectable girl like Mary, then I'd say `yes'. But she's not. \nSIR THOMAS looks out at ANNE.. \nSIR THOMAS She's anything but. \nINT.

Or if she sleeps with him but gives him a girl? \nSIR THOMAS And what if you were to look on the bright side? Just once? \nAn ominous clap of thunder outside.. \nSIR THOMAS Risk nothing, you gain nothing. \nADY ELIZABETH stares at her husband.. \nLADY ELIZABETH hen was it that people stopped thinking of ambition as a sin, and started thinking of it as a virtue? \nSIR THOMAS Easy for you to say. You've had power and wealth all your life. \nLADY ELIZABETH Until I married you, Thomas. And I was happy to give it up. \nLADY ELIZABETH turns, and walks back inside. \nINT.

Imagine...if he were to like me? \nMARY But...you could never be more than his mistress. And that's no substitute for a husband. ANNE But as the King's mistress the least I'd get after he finished with me would be an Earl. And if I fell pregnant? And gave him what his wife has failed to? a beat) Quite apart from the money, it'd be a Duke at least. \nMARY But what about your happiness? Your future? \nANNE shrugs, smiles.. \nANNE I could be a happy Duchess. \nINT. BEDROOOM - NIGHT MARY and ANNE enter the bedroom. A sea of candles. MARY stares at the bed. A child.

That honour would have to go to the Germans. \nHENRY What of our painters, then? \nRANDON Years behind their Italian counterparts. The truth is far from leading the world, we're a provincial outpost, lagging far behind. \nHENRY What? Is no one proud to be English? (turns to ANNE) Anne? What say you? \nANNE gulps. The clanking of cutlery. All eyes on her. \nANNE Me, my Lord? clears throat) I know little of such matters, but I've not heard mention of our armies. Undefeated, I believe, in a generation. \nENRY Well said. \nANNE Or our navy? The finest in the world. \nHENRY It's true. \nANNE The universities in Spain and the philosophers in Germany may be strong, but are they really the equal of Oxford and Thomas More? \nHENRY Never! \nANNE I doubt there is a country that is fairer in Government, or better protected by nature from her enemies, whose people are happier or more prosperous.. \nHENRY She's right, by God!

HEVER CASTLE - STABLE YARD - DAY \nThe following morning.. \nThirty or more RIDERS, STABLE-BOYS and HORSES are gathered. To one side, a deafening pack of DEER-HOUNDS, (wire-haired Lurchers), barking frantically. \nt's a scene of great activity, excitement, and anticipation. \nThe MASTER OF THE HORSE helps HENRY mount his steed - the biggest and most glamorous stallion of all, with wonderful, ornate saddlery. \nnumber of OTHER LADIES are also going hunting, and we notice they ride pillion, (ie), riding on the same horse as their MEN, sitting behind them, holding onto them.. F inally, ANNE comes out. The KING turns.. \nHENRY Good morning, Anne. \nANNE curtseys deeply.. \n(CONTINUED) \nH \nB \nA \nW \nANNE Good morning, your Grace. \nHENRY ho will you be riding with? \nIt's clearly an invitation.

COUNTRYSIDE - DAY The thunder of hooves.. \nWILLIAM STAFFORD leads the way out with a pack of some forty or fifty hounds. It's a stirring sight. Following the hounds, come thirty or forty RIDERS, led by the KING himself. \nHENRY (kicking his horse) Hah! \n(CONTINUED) \nR \nT \nI \nUp ahead, the HOUNDS start to bark. Their pace increases. They've got a scent. The BUGLER blows his horn.. \nThe DOGS begin to increase their pace. The RIDERS urge their horses to gallop. The LADIES hold tight to their MEN.. \nEXT. FIELDS - DAY Up ahead, a STAG, wide-eyed, innocent, lifts it's head.. \nThe sound of the hunting bugle and the roar of approaching footsteps, like thunder. \nThe STAG twitches in fear, then bolts off towards the forest. \nEXT. FIELDS - DAY The DOGS and RIDERS roar across fields. The hounds snarl, almost delirious with primal agitation.. \nAmong the RIDERS, the more advanced HORSEMEN have already opened up a clear lead on their weaker counterparts.. \nn the advanced group, are HENRY, several COURTIERS, his GUARDS and, of course, ANNE.. \nThey jump over a hedge. One of HENRY's COURTIERS catches the hedge and falls. HENRY smiles, then turns to see.. \nANNE comfortably jumping the hedge herself. HENRY's smile fades. He urges his horse to greater speed.. \nHENRY (kicking his horse) Hah..! \nEXT. FIELDS - DAY The terrified DEER bolts into safety of the forest. The barking HOUNDS, locked into the scent, follow. \nhe RIDERS see this, and some pull up. \nIDER We've lost him.

FOREST - DAY HENRY weaves skilfully through low-hanging branches. He looks over his shoulder, ANNE follows, close behind.. \nSharp branches tear at HENRY's face. Some draw blood. Behind him, several other COURTIERS suffer lashes from the branches, and pull up. But not ANNE. She kicks her horse harder. Seemingly impervious to the whipping branches.. \nANNE Hah! \nAhead, the DEER darts and weaves. The HOUNDS give chase. \nEXT. FOREST - RAVINE - DAY alf a mile ahead.. \nA steep ravine, with a sheer drop of twenty-five feet deep. At the bottom, a brook with dangerous rocks, then another sheer climb of twenty-five feet the other side. \nThe DEER arrives, looks, then scampers down the ravine, pursued by the HOUNDS. \nhe remaining RIDERS arrive. They see the DEER scramble up the other side, followed by the DOGS, slipping in the mud, and struggling with the brook. \neveral DOGS fall. Yelping in fright and pain as they lose footing and fall on the rocks. The KING pulls up his horse.. \nHENRY raises his hat, and salutes the DEER. \nENRY he King of England defeated by a humble fawn. \nThe COURTIERS laugh, then they turn their horses around and head off. ANNE stares. It's a clear opportunity to impress. She looks down at the rocks. A long stare, then.. \nANNE (suddenly kicking horse) Hah! \nThe COURTIERS gasp in disbelief as ANNE lurches forward, and leaps into space, heading fearlessly down the sheer ravine. \norse and rider almost tumble down the vertiginous, lethal drop.

Presently, a voice behind her.. \nMASKED MAN Why look so glum, Mary? \nMARY turns to see a MASKED MAN behind her. \nMARY What reason have I to be happy? \nMASKED MAN ou have two men, the King of England and I, both fighting for your love. \nThe MASKED MAN is tall. His voice is quiet, but strong. \nMARY Do I know you? \nMASKED MAN You know me, Mary - but not half as well as I know you. I know you better than anyone here.

Private. \nENRY visibly unwinds, his facial muscles relax. He breathes out deeply. His face becomes softer. More gentle. Then he puts on a comfortable robe, and emerges from behind the screen. \nHENRY goes over to a pile of cushions, and flops down - and smiles at MARY. \nMARY So, this is it? This is where the King of England sleeps? \nHENRY And reads. And writes. And finds a few moments each day...

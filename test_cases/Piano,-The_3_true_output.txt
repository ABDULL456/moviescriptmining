STEWART I'd try children's tunes, nothing more complicated 
ADA is unrepentant, she does not want to teach BAINES the piano. 
STEWART Just be encouraging no one expects him to be good. 
Sc 39      INT/EXT     BAINES' HUT                DAY     SC 39 
The piano is the only cared for item in the rough hut 
STEWART (lifting the lid) It looks good, very nice looking thing. Well . I wish you luck. The girls are very excited about the lessons. 
The "girls" look anything but excited. FLORA shy, plays obsessively with a long strand of greasy hair. ADA is cold and grim. 
STEWART Flora will explain anything Ada says. They talk through their fingers, you can't believe what they say with just their hands. 
STEWART leaves. BAJNES goes to the piano and lifts the lid. He looks at them. ADA signs to FLORA. 
FLORA My mother wants to see your hands. Hold them out. 
BAINES holds out his hands, spread wide as if holding a ball. 
No, no, like this 
FLORA puts her neat little fingers together, first with their backs up then she turns them over. HAINES does the same only his bands are big and coarse. ADA signs to FLORA. BAINES is shyly keen. 
FLORA You have to wash them. 
BAINES They are washed. 
ADA signs. 
FLORA Wash them again. 
BAINES The marks do not come out. They are scars and hardened skin. 
ADA and FLORA do not move. Humiliated BAINES takes a scrub brush, soap and bucket and goes outside. ADA can see him from the window. She moves to her piano. She wants to touch it but she is torn by her feelings, wanting it, but not owning it. She strokes the varnished wood with her hand and softly lifts the lid. Outside FLORA stands beside BAINES pointing out hits of his hand he should still scrub. Furtively she lays her hands on the keys. The instrument is horribly out of tune, almost every note is off. She goes outside and signs to FLORA. 
FLORA There's no tune left in the piano so she can't teach you. 
The two women leave. 
Sc40     EXT      STEEP BUSH HILL                DAY     Sc40 
Two men come crashing out down a steep bush hill, They are tied to each other. BAINES, the younger and stronger, is trying to break their fall by grasping hold of branches and shoots. Finally their fall is checked. The old man is white haired, the front of his suit splattered with the debris of many meals. He sits up feeling about for his glasses. He is blind. His eyes, though closed, wobble and roll BAINES finds the glasses One of the lenses has gone, the other is very dark. The old man fits his handkerchief in the gap. 
Sc 41     EXT     HUGESCREE                    DAY     Sc 41 
BAINES carries the old man on his back, they cross a huge scree. Each of BAINES' steps dislodge a fall of rocks. The crashing of stones echoes across the valley. BAINES and he are but small dots in this giant earth scar 
SCENE 42 DELETED 
Sc 43     INT     BAINES' HUT                    DAY     Sc 43 
Inside BAINES' hut the old man feels the piano. 
BLIND MAN Ah, a Broadbent. A fine instrument. I've not come across one here, or in the Islands where I have tuned some 200. Yes, they like their pianos there.

hearing this, Alex's mind is made up. He looks to Clear. 
ALEX You know what to do. 
CLEAR No! No! Don't! 
ALEX When I do this.. it'll have skipped you... and it'll all be over. 
At that moment, Clear doesn't understand. She looks to him, scared... 
ALEX You know what to do. I'll always be with you. 
He reaches out and grabs the power line, falling back to pull it away from the hood of the car. The cable ARCS furiously. 
COROLLA 
Clear opens the driver's side door and runs out, knocked to her feet as behind her the car EXPLODES. 
ALEX 
is engulfed in the flames. 
ALEX'S POV - THE SHADOWS 
the edges of the FRAME are collapsing. Alex's face, gray and emotionless appears, yet, before it can transform into decay... 
ALEX 
through the flames, as if sensing the oncoming horror, defying the image... 
ALEX NO! 
He looks toward... 
CLEAR - ALEX'S POV 
She... is the last sight he'll ever see. 
WIDER 
The power line ERUPTS! Alex disapears behind the wall of fire and sparks before falling limp on the driveway. 
CLEAR 
Schreck, Weine and PARAMEDICS rush to the girl. Schreck turns back, calling out to a paramedic, helplessly watching by ther burning car. 
SCHRECK Is he alive? 
CLEAR'S EYES 
flash open, horrified, answering the question... 
THE SKY 
a web of LIGHTNING CRACKS across the Heavens, as if Death was making a final angry proclamation. 
SCHRECK AND WEINE 
CAMERA EASES IN on the agents, exchanging rattled expressions that convey their unease in the proof that Alex was right. 
CLEAR - OVERHEAD 
As a pair of paramedics work on her, a soft breeze blows across the girl, and only the girl. CAMERA MOVES DOWN TO HER FACE, her eyes opened... welling with tears... seeming to realize... to sense, he is gone. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY - CLEAR 
SCREAMS, as if reacting to Alex's death, but in actuality it is a reaction to the pain of delivering her child. 
DOCTORS AND NURSES 
stand between Clear's legs in the stirrups... 
DOCTOR A little more. Little more! 
CLEAR 
breathes, pushes hard. Alex's parents stand on each side of her, holding her hand, wiping her forehead. 
THE DOCTOR 
cuts the umbilical cord. 
DOCTOR He's here. A beautiful boy. 
CLEAR, KEN AND BARBARA 
smile and fight back the tears. Clear begins to laugh euphorically through the tears. 
CLEAR I felt him! When the baby was born... I felt Alex pass through me... like the night he died... 
Clear lifts her head up, still battling the pain of labor... 
CLEAR'S POV - THE BABY

BARTLEBY 
Don't, my friend. Don't let your sympathies get the best of you, as they did me way back when. Scion or not, she's just a human. And regardless, our sins are forgiven by passing through that arch. No harm, no foul. 
LOKI 
That sounds thin. 
BARTLEBY 
Fine. We'll cover ourselves. We'll take out a slew of people. Maybe amidst the body count, He won't notice. 
LOKI 
Oh, that's being realistic. 
Bartleby reaches out and grabs Loki, slamming him against the wall. 
BARTLEBY 
I'm going home, Loki. And nobody - not even the Almighty Himself - is going to make that otherwise. 
Bartleby releases Loki and smiles. He exits. Loki watches him. 
LOKI 
Shit. 
He follows. 
EXT CAMP FIRE - NIGHT 
Another Newspaper headline regarding 'John Doe Jersey' fills the frame. It is lowered to reveal Jay, Bethany, and Rufus sitting around a makeshift fire in the middle of nowhere. Jay rolls a joint. Silent Bob reads the paper. 
BETHANY 
I don't understand why we couldn't stay on the train. You threw those guys off. 
RUFUS 
A very basic strategy - if your enemies know where you are, then don't be there. 
BETHANY 
And what's with that? Why are we enemies? The guy almost gutted me, for God's sake! 
JAY 
He had the knife at your throat. To gut you, he'd have to have the knife at your stomach. 
BETHANY 
Semantics! Semantics that don't even answer mv question. 
RUFUS 
Well, I know I'd perceive the person sent to kill me as my enemy. 
BETHANY 
What do you mean, kill? I wasn't asked to kill them -just stop them from going into that church. 
RUFUS 
And how were you going to do that? Preoccupy them with a game of Bingo? 
BETHANY 
I've never killed anything before in my life! 
JAY 
I'll do it. 
RUFUS 
Shut the fuck up, little man - you couldn't kill a pint of ice cream, let alone an angel. 
JAY 
Fuck you - I can kill an angel as good as the next guy. 
RUFUS 
Oh yeah? How' would you do it? 
JAY 
I'd give him a Van Damme neck-break, like in 'Hard Target'. D'jou see that flick? 
RUFUS 
(ignoring jay; to Bethany) 
Killing an angel's a two-step process - first you have to cut off their wings. which then makes them human. From that point on, it's the same as killing anything else - head or heart, take your pick. 
BETHANY 
You say it as if it's easy. 
RUFUS 
(oblivious to Jay) 
Problem is, I don't think we could pull it off even if we wanted to. All this time away from the Divine Presence should have made those two weaker - and those guys felt far from weak. Either that or someone's protecting them - someone with juice. 
BETHANY 
So then we're screwed? 
(shrugs) 
Shit, that's the best news l've heard in days. 
RUFUS 
This doesn't excuse you from tryng to stop them. 
BETHANY 
Count me out. You're telling me they're unstopable, I'm exhausted - both psychologically and physically, the odds are against us. I say we kick back and wait for the end -a little non~xistence might be just what the doctor ordered. 
JAY 
I'm with her. I don't care about dying, so long as we're all going to die. 
RUFUS 
What are you babbling about now? 
JAY 
If I was the only one, that'd bother me because every-one else would go on living, having a good time without me. But if we all go at once, that'd be okay, because I know I'm not missing anything. 
BETHANY 
See? You know it's right when even he's making sense. 
JAY 
Besides, she said if we were in a situation where we were going to die in like five minutes, she'd have sex with me and Silent Bob. 
RUFUS 
So you're suggesting she throw in the towel and let eons of work and history get blinked out of existence just so you can get laid? 
JAY 
(thinks) 
No. Just so me and Silent Bob could get laid. 
BETHANY 
Now that we're all but in total agreement on this, I'd just like to finally know - why me? 
JAY 
Because you've got nice tits. 
BETHANY 
I wasn't talking to you! 
(to Rufus) 
Why me? Why do I have to do this? Nobody's come 
clean on that. Out of everyone on the whole god-damned planet. How come I got tapped? 
Rufus looks at her. He shrugs. 
RUFUS 
Family ties. 
JAY

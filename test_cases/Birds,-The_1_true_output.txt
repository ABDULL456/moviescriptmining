FULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE 
as they ENTER, CAMERA FOLLOWING them throughout into dining room where Lydia dials phone, talking to Mitch all along. 
LYDIA He sold the feed to me, didn't he? 
MITCH Caviat emptor, Mother. Let the buyer beware. 
LYDIA Whose side are you on? 
MITCH I'm simply quoting the law. 
LYDIA Never mind the law. Cathy, you can start serving the soup. 
She has finished dialing now, is waiting while the phone RINGS. 
LYDIA This won't take a minute, Miss Dan... (into phone) Hello, Fred? This is Lydia Brenner. I didn't interrupt your dinner, did I? (pause) Fred, that feed you sold me is no good. (pause) The chicken feed. The three bags I brought. 
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA 
holding the telephone. 
LYDIA Well, it's just no good. The chickens won't eat it. (pause) They're always hungry, Fred. I opened one of the sacks when I got home, and I poured it out for them, and they wouldn't touch it. Now you know chickens as well as I do, and when they won't eat, there's just something wrong with what they're being fed, that's all. (pause) No, they're not fussy chickens. (pause) Who? What's he got to do with it? (pause) Fred, I don't care how much feed you sold him. My chickens... (pause) He did? Dan Fawcett? (pause) This afternoon? (pause) Well, that only proves what I'm saying. The feed you sold us is... (pause) Oh. Oh, I see. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.  Uh- huh. Maybe I ought to go over to see him. You don't think there's something going around, do you? (pause) No, never. (pause) No, Fred, they don't seem sick at all. They just won't eat. (pause) Mmmm. Mmmmm. Well, I'll try to get over to Dan's farm.  Maybe he'll... mmmmm... mmmmm... all right, Fred, thanks. (she hangs up, puzzled) 
FULL SHOT - THE DINING ROOM 
as Lydia comes to the table. Mitch and Melanie are sitting opposite each other in the center chairs. Cathy is serving the last bowl of soup. 
LYDIA (as she sits) He got a call from Dan Fawcett a little while ago. His chickens won't eat, either. 
CATHY It's what you said, Mom. Mr. Brinkmeyer's feed is no good. 
LYDIA (slowly) No, Cathy. He sold Mr. Fawcett a different brand. (extremely worried) You don't think they're getting sick, do you, Mitch? 
CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA 
her eyes troubled as she picks up her napkin. 
DISSOLVE 
FULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM 
The meal is over. The lovebirds in their hanging cage have been covered for the night. In the b.g. Mitch and Lydia are carrying the stacked dishes to the kitchen. In the f.g. Cathy and Melanie are by a small upright piano. Melanie is playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from the ashtray now and again to take a puff. 
CATHY I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds. 
MELANIE Your brother told me. 
LYDIA (as she goes into kitchen) Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right? 
MELANIE No, not exactly. 
CATHY Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods. 
LYDIA (from the kitchen) Cathy! 
CATHY Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it. (to Melanie) He spends half his day in the detention cells at the Hall of Justice. 
LYDIA (coming from kitchen) In a democracy, Cathy, everyone is entitled to a fair trial. Your brother's practice... 
CATHY Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods. (to Melanie) He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it? (she starts for living room) I mean, even twice would be overdoing it, don't you think? 
MELANIE (to Mitch as he carries load of dishes out) Why did he shoot her? 
MITCH He was watching a ball game on television. 
MELANIE What? 
MITCH His wife changed the channel. 
He GOES INTO kitchen. 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY 
Melanie interrupts her playing to take another puff at her cigarette. 
CATHY Is smoking fun? 
MELANIE Oh, I suppose so. 
CATHY Could I have a puff? 
MELANIE I don't think your mother would like that. 
CATHY (O.S.) Just a little one. 
TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY 
They both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen. Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette. Quickly, Cathy takes a small puff. 
CATHY (delighted) Why, it's just like air, isn't it? (determined) When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know. 
MELANIE I know. 
CATHY Are you coming to my party? 
MELANIE I don't think so. (seeing the child's face) I have to get back to San Francisco. 
CATHY Don't you like us? 
MELANIE (touching her hair) Darling, of course I do! 
CATHY Don't you like Bodega Bay? 
MELANIE I don't know yet. 
CATHY Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge. 
MELANIE (smiling) I guess it does get a little hectic at times. 
CATHY If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party. 
Melanie laughs. 
CATHY You see, they've got this whole complicated thing figured out where I'm going over to Michele's for the afternoon, and Michele's mother is going to say she has a headache and would I mind very much if she took me home. Then, when we get back here, all of the kids'll jump out! (pause) Won't you come? Won't you please come? 
CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE 
shaking her head, glancing toward the kitchen. 
MELANIE I don't think so, Cathy. 
INT. KITCHEN - TWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH 
Mitch is helping her as she loads the dishwasher. 
LYDIA She's a charming girl, isn't she, Mitch? 
MITCH Yes, very. 
LYDIA And certainly pretty.

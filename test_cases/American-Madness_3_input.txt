All right. If the boy proves an alibi, he's all right, isn't he? 
INSPECTOR 
If he can do it, yes. 
DICKSON 
Why, certainly he can. 
(to Matt) 
Matt, now all you've got to do is tell them where you were last night, between twelve and twelve-thirty, and everything will be all right. 
MATT 
(averting Dickson's gaze) 
I already told him I was home. 
DICKSON 
(to Inspector) 
There you are. 
INSPECTOR 
That's what he says. I got a man from headquarters checking up on it now. 
DICKSON 
(confidently) 
Good. 
(to Matt, smiling) 
You've got nothing to worry about. Soon as the report comes in, you'll be released. 
(to Inspector) 
And listen, don't talk so loud. Take it easy. Coast a little. 
He exits scene. 
148. INT. THE LOBBY OF THE BANK - FULL SHOT 
Showing the normal activity of the bank in contrast to the turmoil going on inside. Just a few people scattered about. 
CAMERA TRUCKS towards the other end of the lobby, establishing the calm and peace of the place along the way. CAMERA STOPS on a CLOSE SHOT at the bank telephone operator at the switchboard. Oscar, the young teller, is relating his story for the hundredth time. 
OSCAR 
Gee, what do you think? There was that watchman, that poor watchman, lying on the floor right in front of me. Oh, you coulda knocked me over with a pin! 
OPERATOR 
(wide-eyed) 
You don't say! Dead? 
OSCAR 
Dead? He was lifeless! You know, I was the first one to see him. I was coming down the stairs, and there was the watchman lying on the floor, right in front of me. Dead! I tell you, you coulda knocked 
OPERATOR 
(interrupting) 
Yeah, I coulda knocked you over with a pin. 
OSCAR 
Yeah, you coulda 
(realizes he is getting the brush-off) 
Oh - almonds to you! Almonds! 
Oscar exits scene. The operator turns her attention to the switch-board, apparently Oscar has interrupted a conversation she has been having. 
OPERATOR 
Hello, Mame. This is Gert, again 
(pause) 
Say, listen - I just heard something that'll make your head swim . . . Listen to this . . . Yeah, the bank was robbed last night. Yeah, over a hundred thousand dollars. 
149. ANOTHER SWITCHBOARD OPERATOR - CLOSE SHOT 
MAME 
(into phone) 
Who did it? 
GERT 
I don't know who did it, but the chief teller's in an awful jam. 
MAME 
Call me up later. I'm going to call up Lou now. 
She pulls the plug, plugs in another wire. 
MAME 
Hello, Lou. Did you hear what happened over at the Union National Bank? 
(a light flashes) 
Wait a minute, Lou. 
(plugs in wire) 
Hello? Yes, sir. I'm trying to get them. 
(pulls plug) 
Yes, Lou, listen. They was robbed over two hundred thousand dollars. Can you beat that? 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
150. EXT. FRONT OF AN OFFICE BLDG. - MED. SHOT 
Two men coming out of the building, engrossed in conversation. 
MAN 
Stole over a quarter of a million. Can you beat that? 
The other man whistles in surprise. 
2ND MAN 
(whistling) 
Whew! You can't laugh that off. 
Several people in the crowd, overhearing them, turn and stare. 
LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
151. EXT. A STREET CORNER - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Of an old lady, pitiful expression, begging alms. Two gentlemen are beside her. One of them reaches in his pocket for a coin. 
3RD MAN 
I thought the Union National was pretty solid. 
At the mention of the Union National, the old lady looks up, startled. 
4TH MAN 
I did too. 
3RD MAN 
Half a million is a lot of money. I wouldn't be surprised if they had to close their doors. 
The first man drops a coin in the old lady's palm and they leave. The beggar woman, oblivious of the coin in her hand, stares unbelieving, at the departing men. Suddenly her face screws up in horror. 
OLD LADY 
Oh, good gracious!

DENG Some say Joseph Kony is a wizard. A shapeshifter. He calls himself a Christian... 
He pulls a baggy of tobacco from his pocket and begins to roll a cigarette... 
DENG (CONT'D) ... but I say he is Satan, who devours his own people. 
SAM Kony is the leader of the LRA? 
DENG He is the one we have been fighting for years. But there is very little we can do. Our weapons are old, and our boots are full of holes. We have been forgotten by the rest of the world. 
And now Deng turns to Sam... 
DENG (CONT'D) Why are you here? 
SAM S'cuse me? 
DENG What are you looking for in this place? 
SAM Ain't lookin for nuthin. 
Deng staring at him, skeptical... 
DENG And then you will get your picture and go back to your life and all this will just be a story you tell your friends. 
INT/EXT. HOTEL - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT 
Sam has no response... and Deng lights his cigarette... and suddenly we hear voices... through the open window... children's voices... Sam peering into the darkness but seeing nothing... only empty streets... and then one-by-one... out of the darkness like apparitions... we see children coming up the street carrying bedrolls... some of them singing spiritual hymns as they walk... laughing as children do... at first just a dozen or so... and then more... fifty... a hundred... 
EXT. HOTEL ROOM BALCONY - NUMILE, SUDAN - NIGHT 
Deng steps onto the balcony next to Sam. 
DENG They are night commuters. They come from deep in the bush. Their parents send them out because it is safer to sleep here than in their own homes. 
SAM Why? 
DENG Because death comes at night in the villages and refugee camps. 
And we continue to watch this great migration of children... now streaming into this town... a few of them finding a dark corner just below us... unrolling their reed mats... huddling up against each other for the long night... 
DENG (CONT'D) These are the lucky one so far. The ones the rebels have not found. The invisible children. 
Sam watching them for another beat then suddenly turning, moving back into the room... 
DENG (CONT'D) Where are you going? 
INT. STAIRWAY - HOTEL - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT 
Sam coming down these steps. Deng following. 
DENG (CALLING AFTER) Sam... 
EXT. HOTEL - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT 
Sam exiting the hotel, moving to a group of 5 children huddled on the sidewalk... 
SAM Get up... let's go... 
The children looking up, surprised to see a white man here... 
SAM (CONT'D) Come on... 
The children getting to their feet... and Sam moves to another cluster of children up the block as Deng catches up to him... 
DENG What are you doing? 
SAM They ain't sleepin out here. Tell em they're comin inside. (to children on the ground) Ya'll get up... let's go... 
And Sam starts to move up the block further, wanting to gather up more children, but Deng stops him... 
DENG Sam, there are too many... 
And he looks up the street and we see more children here than we thought... hundreds of young kids huddled on the streets... 
DENG (CONT'D) ... you can't help them all. 
Sam knows he's right. A moment here as he looks to the children he's gathered, staring up at him... 
SAM I can help these here. 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIMULE, SUDAN - NIGHT 
-- and a DOZEN CHILDREN are ushered into this small room. Sam pushing their cots against a wall so there's more space. Deng speaking to the children -- 
DENG (ARABIC) Settle down... it's alright... you can sleep here till morning... 
-- and they begin to settle onto the floor... and now we notice a particular BOY in this group... maybe 8 years old... wearing bright GREEN SHORTS... and we watch as he and his SISTER move to a corner of the room and unroll their mats... 
... and eventually Sam turns off the lamp and we stay here in the dark... Sam on his cot, listening to these 12 little children breathing... their shifting bodies on the floor trying to get comfortable... and then... 
CUT TO: 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - NUMILE, SUDAN - DAY 
Sam's closed eyes... sound asleep... 
Just before dawn. Deng standing over him, shaking him awake...

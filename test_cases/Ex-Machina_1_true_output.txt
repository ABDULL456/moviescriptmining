NATHAN is ahead. 
He reaches an outcrop of rock, with a wall of violent water behind him. 
CALEB struggles to catch up. 
As soon as he reaches the outcrop, NATHAN moves on. 
EXT. GLACIER - DAY 
NATHAN and CALEB sits near the base of a spectacular glacier. 
Behind them, from a blue cave cut into the ice, water flows. 
A silence. Then: 
CALEB Can we talk about the lies you've been spinning me? 
NATHAN glances over at CALEB. 
NATHAN What lies? 
CALEB I didn't win a competition. And there was no lottery to meet you. I was selected. 
NATHAN waits. 
CALEB (CONT'D) It's obvious, once I stop to think. Why would you randomly select an examiner for a Turing test? You could have had some bean-counter turn up at your front door. Or the guy who fixes the air conditioning. 
Beat. 
NATHAN Are your feelings hurt? 
CALEB doesn't answer. 
NATHAN shrugs. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) The competition was a smoke screen. I didn't want anyone to know what I was doing here, or why you were required. 
CALEB Why me? 
NATHAN As a Blue Book employee, you were pre-screened. Loyal. And I needed someone who would ask the right kind of questions. So I did a search, and found the most talented coder in the company. 
NATHAN corrects himself. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) Or - second most. He stands.    Looks up at the ice structures around them. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) You know what? Instead of seeing this as a deception, see it as proof. 
CALEB Proof of what? 
NATHAN Come on, Caleb. Fuck modesty. You think I don't know what it is to be smart? Smarter than everyone else around you. Smarter than all the other kids, jockeying for position in school, college, work. 
Beat. 
NATHAN (CONT'D) You have the light on you.   Not lucky. Chosen. 
Above them, clouds fragment and reform. 
EXT. CLEARING - NIGHT 
Night has fallen. 
CALEB lies in the clearing, looking up at the stars. 
The glow from the CIRCULAR WINDOW to NATHAN'S STUDY is like a full moon on the grass. 
CALEB stands. 
Looks down the light-well to NATHAN'S STUDY. 
Where he sees NATHAN and KYOKO. 
They are having sex. 
CALEB watches.    Just for a beat. 
CUT TO - 
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
- CALEB standing in the shower. 
He shuts his eyes. 
INTERCUT WITH - 
- images of AVA. Torso, hands, mouths. 
FLASH OF - 
- AVA and CALEB about to kiss.    But their lips never contacting. 
CUT TO - 
- CALEB opening his eyes. 
He exhales. 
Then switches off the taps. 
INT. HOUSE/CALEB'S BEDROOM - NIGHT 
CALEB enters his bedroom wearing boxer shorts. 
The TV plays the live stream from the observation room. 
On the screen, we can see AVA, sitting at her table, drawing. 
As CALEB pulls on a T-shirt -

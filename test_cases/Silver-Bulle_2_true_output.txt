The peacemaker rises out of the mist again. The hands holding it are bloody. Blood runs down the bat. It descends. Bonk! The WEREWOLF roars again. There is a GURGLING SCREAM from OWEN... and then a curious SPLINTERING SOUND as the WEREWOLF sinks its fangs into the bat. 
EXT.  THE RAVINE 
THE CAMERA MOVES ABOVE as the WEREWOLF moves below, escaping down the draw. 
Pause. SOUND, IN THE B.G.- low but slowly getting louder: a congregation singing "Bringing In the Sheaves" to the accompaniment of a pipe organ. 
WEREWOLF (sing-songy voice) Bringing in the sheaves... bringing in the sheaves... we shall come rejoicing... bringing in the sheaves... 
THE WEREWOLF FADES OUT; human voices singing the same hymn overwhelm it and we 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT.  HOLY FAMILY CATHOLIC CHURCH, PULPIT POV  MORNING 
It's an almost exact reprise of #167. Most of the mourners are crying; MRS. BOWIE playing the organ; MARTY'S chair parked at the back. We can see UNCLE AL, MARTY, TAMMY, and MRS. STURMFULLER, exactly as they were at BRADY KINCAID'S funeral; in fact, this seems to be an instant reply of that event. One difference: we can't see BRADY'S coffin. It's below us. The hymn ends. 
INT.  FATHER LOWE, IN THE PULPIT 
LOWE Mr. and Mrs. Kincaid have asked that there be no mass said here this afternoon. They did ask me to say a word of comfort to you if I could. 
INT.  THE CONGREGATION, FEATURING HERB KINCAID 
He sits in the first pew. In his grief he looks dead. 
HERB There is no comfort, Father. Only private justice. 
INT.  LOWE, AT THE PULPIT 
He's thrown off his stride. Beginning to sweat. He's like an actor trying to remember his lines. 
LOWE Uh, if there's any word of comfort I can give you, it's just this: the face of the beast always becomes known; the time- 
He looks down. His eyes widen in fear. 
INT.  THE COFFINS, LOWE'S POV 
Yes, that's coffins- plural. Where BRADY'S coffin was formerly, there are now six coffins, smothered with flowers. 
INT.  LOWE, IN THE PULPIT 
He is badly scared now; sweat is dripping off him. 
LOWE The time... the time of the beast always passes. There are answers... ways... ways to... to cope... if we turn to each other... 
HERB (bestial voice) Father- 
LOWE looks toward: 
INT.  FIRST ROW PEW, WITH HERB KINCAID, LOWE'S POV 
He's looking down at something in his hands. Now he looks up and we see his face has become bestial. His eyes are green. As we look at him, the transformation cotinues. He's turning into a werewolf. 
HERB (snarling) It tore out his heart. 
And sure enough, HERB KINCAID holds BRADY'S dripping heart up in what were hands but which are now rapidly becoming paws. 
INT.  LESTER LOWE, AT THE PULPIT 
He staggers back, in terror. 
LOWE (shrieks) No! 
INT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV 
MRS. BOWIE begins bringing in a few more sheaves on the church organ, and the congregation begins to sing. 
CONGREGATION Sowing in the morning/sowing seeds of kindness/sowing in the noontide/and the dewy eve... 
We pan their faces, stopping on JOE HALLER. Now something is happening to JOE'S face. It is bulging, changing. He looks up from his hymnal and his eyes glare green. The pupils are split. He grins, showing big teeth. 
They are all changing. Among the things we see are: 
PETE SYLVESTER, who is a church deacon, rushing down the aisle, changing, snarling. He grabs ANDY FAIRTON and the two of them grapple in the aisle. 
A YOUNG WOMAN with a baby in her arms turns back the blanket covering the baby's face and we see it's a wolfling; already the YOUNG WOMAN'S own hands are turning into claws. 
TAMMY STURMFULLER changing; PELTZER the druggist changing; the ZINNEMAN BROTHERS changing. 
At the organ, MRS. BOWIE is now a werewolf clad in tatters of a silk bombazine dress; she/it is still wearing a veiled hat on her head, and she is beating the shit out of the organ keys with her clawed hands. She sounds like Jerry Lee Lewis after swallowing about a dozen bennies. And now the tune changes from the remnants of "Bringing In The Sheaves." It changes into the Rheingold jingle. 
CONGREGATION (snarling chorus) My beer is Rheingold the dry beer... Think of Rheingold whenever you buy beer... 
INT.  LOWE 
FATHER LOWE goes stumbling backward, dropping his hymnal. The man is in an extremity of terror. 
REV. LOWE No! No! No! 
INT.  THE CONGREGATION, LOWE'S POV 
Some are tearing their hymnals apart and throwing them at each other. One guy- BILLY McCLAREN, maybe- wings one of them through a stained-glass window. Some of the werewolves- for they are all werewolves now- fight or make love in the aisles. The rest sway back and forth, grinning ferociously, singing. 
CONGREGATION (snarling it out) It's not bitter, not sweet, it's a real frosty treat...

Phyllis nods. 
TED (angry) I don't believe it! That's crazy! Why would Jim do something like that? 
Phyllis polishes off the rest of Ted's drink. 
PHYLLIS (angry herself) You want to know why? I'll tell you why... (signaling to the waiter) Another scotch and soda for the gentleman. (back to Ted) I'll tell you exactly why. Because you're not his buddy anymore. Because he can't count on you to sit around the office every night until eight or nine and shoot the shit with him. 
TED I can't. I've got Billy to take care of. 
PHYLLIS (exasperated) You dope. O'Connor doesn't give a damn about Billy. All he wants is somebody that'll hang around with him every night so he won't have to go home. 
TED (stiff) I don't believe you. 
The waiter sets Ted's drink on the table in front of him. He starts to reach for it, but Phyllis is quicker. 
PHYLLIS (taking a stiff drink) All right. Okay. But tell me something, Kramer. Who do you think is palling around with O'Connor these days? 
Ted shrugs. 
TED How should I know? 
PHYLLIS Murray. 
REACTION, TED 
Stunned, but trying to be nonchalant. 
TED So... what's so terrible about that? 
PHYLLIS (would like to take him by the shoulders and shake him until his teeth rattle) Oh, for God's sake, Kramer. You have got to be the world's most naive human being. (leaning forward) Murray has gone in and changed every single ad you've done on the entire Fire and Ice campaign. Every layout... Every idea... Every single thing, right down the line. 
TED No. No, I don't believe it. Jim O'Connor would never let anything like that happen. He gave me my shot in this business. If it wasn't for Jim O'Connor I'd be  I don't know where I'd be. He's a wonderful man... 
PHYLLIS (apologetic for having upset Ted) Kramer, I'm sorry. All I was trying to do was  
TED (cutting her off) I don't want to hear another word against him. Not another word. He's a wonderful man... a wonderful man... 
CUT TO: 
INT. TED KRAMER'S OFFICE  DAY 
INSERT: The finished proof of the ad that Murray had done, that Ted had seen in O'Connor's office. 
ON TED 
TRACKING WITH HIM as he steams out of his door and marches along the corridor to O'Connor's office. 
SECRETARY (as Ted brushes past her) I'm sorry, Mr. O'Connor is in conference. 
But it is too late. Ted barrels into O'Connor's office without bothering to knock. 
CUT TO: 
INT. O'CONNOR'S OFFICE  DAY 
O'Connor is alone in the office. He looks up startled as Ted comes barging in. 
TED (furious) All right, Jim. You said I was running this show, right? You said no decisions without my approval, right? (brandishing the ad) Well what the hell is this? What's going on, Jim? 
O'CONNOR (embarrassed) Well, ah... I thought it over and I decided we're doing it Murray's way. 
TED Jim, this is garbage. This isn't anything like what we talked to Revlon about. None of it. You can't  
O'CONNOR (tough) That's my decision, Ted and that's final. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DINING AREA  KRAMER APT.  NIGHT 
ON BILLY 
Who sits looking down at the plate of food in front of him as though it was a coiled rattlesnake about to strike. 
BILLY What is it? 
ON TED 
Preoccupied, jumpy. He is eating, but he doesn't taste a thing. 
TED Salisbury steak. 
BILLY I hate it. 
TED You don't hate it. We had Salisbury steak last week and you liked it fine. 
BILLY (stubborn) No I didn't. I hate the brown stuff. It's gross. 
TED (strained patience) All it is is onions and gravy. 
BILLY I'm allergic to onions. 
TED You are not allergic of onions. You've had them lots of times. 
BILLY (sullen) I want a pizza. 
TED (trying not to lose patience) No. This is fine. Just take a bite, you'll like it fine. 
Reluctantly, Billy takes a tiny bite. He barely puts it in his mouth before he spits it out with a great show of being physically ill. 
BILLY I think I'm going to throw up. 
TED (getting pissed off) Oh, for God's sake... Here.

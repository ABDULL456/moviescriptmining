NORA Look, Randolph. We know it wasn't you who killed Spinner. 
SHELDON We'll go to the police, first thing tomorrow... straighten everything out. 
RANDOLPH Oh!  Goody-goody gumdrops! (to Nora) Vodka straight up is fine, sugar babe! 
He grabs the bottle out of her hand. He rises from the chair. He takes a CD, "PARTY TIME WITH RAINBOW RANDOLPH," from his pocket and puts it into an audio system on the fireplace wall. 
RANDOLPH Did you put on a little weight, honey? That's okay, you're still a hot little brood mare. I bet you miss the sweet sting of my riding crop. Giddy up, pony! 
The THEME SONG from his show starts to PLAY. He flicks a switch and a spotlight goes on. He sings and dances. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH (to tune of 'Ol' MacDonald) 'Rainbow Randolph is the man. Yes he, yes he, is. He's the Prez of Rainbowland. Yes he, yes he, is. With some fun, fun here, and a laugh, laugh there. Here a dance, there a song, Everything is fun, fun. Rainbow Randolph is the King, the King of Rainbowland!' 
Randolph takes another drink from the vodka bottle. Sheldon suddenly lunges at Randolph and tries to grab the gun. Randolph shrieks. The two men wrestle on the floor, but Randolph is not much of a fighter. He screams as Sheldon rolls him toward the fireplace. 
SHELDON Is this what you want? A Hansel and Gretel ending?! You want to be the big bad wolf? 
RANDOLPH Stop! It's too hot!    The heat! It's driving me mad! 
Randolph rolls Sheldon to the bottom. Nora reaches for a fireplace poker and whacks Randolph with it. Randolph cries out and drops the gun. Sheldon grabs it and points it at Randolph who lies on the floor, blubbering like a child. He's bleeding. 
RANDOLPH Go ahead, kill me! Finish me off. My life's over anyway. Everything I touch turns to shit. Put me out of my misery. 
Sheldon slowly takes the gun away from Randolph's head. 
SHELDON You're not nothing. You're bitter, misguided and I'm guessing a raging alcoholic, but you're still Rainbow Randolph. Despite everything that's happened, you once made children happy. 
Randolph sits up and looks at Sheldon through watery eyes. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
RANDOLPH Would you be my friend? 
SHELDON Sure. 
RANDOLPH (to Nora) You too? 
NORA I guess. 
RANDOLPH Sorry about the brood mare stuff. 
Randolph throws his arms around Sheldon and cries into his shoulder. Sheldon pats his back. He glances down at Randolph's gun and sees that it's a toy. 
Nora pours vodka onto a small pillow she's taken from one of the chairs. She kneels next to Randolph and blots the gash on his head with the vodka soaked pillow. Randolph lets out a blood curdling scream. 
INT. SHELDON'S FOYER - TIGHT ON REVOLVER - SHORT WHILE LATER 
being loaded. 
WIDER 
Sheldon loads his gun as Randolph is curled up on the couch like a little puppy. Nora hands him a cup of tea. 
RANDOLPH (a pitiful child) Thank you. 
She walks over to Sheldon. 
NORA (re: gun) What are you doing? 
Sheldon continues to load the gun. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHELDON Just making the playing field even. I'm tired of running this race with one leg. 
NORA You're letting them drag you down to their level. 
RANDOLPH (from couch) She's right, Sheldon. Don't make the same mistakes I did. Keep your dignity intact. 
He accidentally spills some hot tea on himself. 
RANDOLPH Son-of-a-bitch! 
SHELDON I appreciate everyone's concern, but I can take care of myself. 
Nora and Randolph look at each other.

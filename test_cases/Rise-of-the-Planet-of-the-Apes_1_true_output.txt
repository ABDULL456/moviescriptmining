TAXI DRIVER Where to, my man? 
JACOBS HAS A SHIVER. 
JACOBS 24 Marigold. 
TAXI DRIVER Want me to turn down the air? 
JACOBS 
(DESPONDENT) Whatever. 
HE COUGHS. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SAN FRANCISCO STREETS - DAY 
Apes leap over cars, run in and out of traffic. PEDESTRIANS take cover. SNIPER FIRE RINGS OUT from helicopters above - an APE FALLS. Caesar's leading, running alongside Cornelia. She falters. Caesar slows with her, concerned. SHE LOOKS ILL. But Cornelia digs deep and picks up her speed. Caesar continues on. 
INT. HELICOPTER- DAY 
Will's plastered to the window, anxiously watching Caesar's progress. Below, the BLACK LOCUST that is the pack of apes has grown larger, but they stay together, moving implacably North through the San Francisco streets. Up ahead, the GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE COMES INTO VIEW - majestic, shimmering in the afternoon light. And Will realizes the moment he sees it. 
WILL They're going to Muir Woods. (turning to Huffs) I'm sure of it. He doesn't want to hurt anyone - he's just trying to get the apes out of the City! 
HUFFS 
(INTO HEADSET) Shut down the Golden Gate Bridge! 
WILL No - let them through! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY 
Cars speed across the bridge in both directions. HIGHWAY PATROLMEN rush to block the entrances. 
EXT. PARK OUTSIDE ENTRANCE TO GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE - DAY 
FOG. 
The apes arrive at the shadow of the great bridge - a stampeding phalanx with Caesar at the lead. But Cornelia can't keep up any more. Losing her balance, she stumbles, falls. Caesar rushes to Cornelia's side. By the time he reaches her, she's dead - a WHITE FOAM has formed at her lips. She's been poisoned. 
CUT TO: FLASHBACK of Cornelia, sniffing the cookie. Will yelling "Don't"... 
CUT TO: Caesar - devastated, the rage building in his face. He looks up as one of the HELICOPTERS BUZZES LOW - HE SEES 
WILL. THEY MAKE EYE CONTACT. Caesar struggles to his feet with Cornelia in his arms - he's going to carry her across the bridge. Other helicopters BUZZ low, SHOTS RING OUT, SIRENS CLOSE IN. Apes take cover around trees and structures, but they're getting PICKED OFF. Maurice takes Cornelia from Caesar's arms as Buck and Rocket urge him forward. Koba hangs back, watching, fascinated, as Maurice lays Cornelia's body on the grass. 
INT. HELICOPTER - DAY 
Will's gone pale. 
STEWART 
(ALARMED) Is he hurt? 
WILL No - not him. 
EXT. BRIDGE ENTRANCE - DAY 
Two CHP PATROL CARS are frantically stopping new traffic from entering the bridge and waving exiting traffic through. 
Suddenly, OUT OF THE FOG, THE APES APPEAR. TRAFFIC slams to a halt. PEOPLE are STUNNED as chimps, gorillas, orangutans VAULT OVER THEIR CARS, run down the middle of the traffic - stampeding across the bridge. Helicopters BUZZ around like flies - SHARPSHOOTERS unable to get a safe shot. 
AT THE NORTH END OF THE BRIDGE Blocked off by CHP, all traffic stopped. A few helicopters touch down - SHARPSHOOTERS jump out, rifles ready, and follow on foot behind SQUAD CARS, FOUR ACROSS, 
THAT SLOWLY DRIVE ACROSS THE BRIDGE - TOWARD THE APES.

INT.  LAB ONE 
The crew has packed their essentials and now wait to dock with Space Lab. Yll is standing before the others holding Jason's machete. 
YLLO We must assume the machete was an intricate part of the game of hockey. 
DELONGPRE I'm thinking Rizzo was right. 
YLLO Thinking with your dick again, Delongpre? 
DELONGPRE Maybe we should go with them. Like you said, your Space Lab connections can deal with this thing. At least we'll be safe. 
YLLO They are not going anywhere. I cut power to the  shuttle. 
The kids and Crutch stare at him. Cold hearted. 
INT.  SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY 
Rizzo and Kkinsa approach. 
RIZZO Open the doors. 
Kkinsa punches in a series of buttons. Nothing. 
KKINSA Something's wrong. 
RIZZO Keep trying! 
INT.  LAB ONE 
YLLO Everyone ready? 
Yllo grabs a mike from a console. 
YLLO Fat Lou, what's the ETA? 
STATIC. 
YLLO Lou, goddamjnit! Bernie, where's Lou?! 
STATIC. 
Boeman moves to one of the consoles, clicks a few buttons. 
ON MONITOR 
We see the view from the bridge security camera. Lots of blood and the mangled combination of Lou and Bernie. 
THORGAN Yuck. 
DELONGPRE We're screwed. 
YLLO The ship doesn't need pilots to dock. We'll disembark and you'll see. Everything will be fine. 
BOEMAN Uh...that's gonna be a problem. The ship's not on auto-pilot. We're flying blind. (a beat) Thirty minutes till impact. 
All eyes turn to Yllo, for guidance, his back to the outer door. 
YLLO I guess...we'll have to go to the bridge. 
THORGAN But... 
Jason is out there. Then -- 
WHAM-WHAM-WHAM! 
The outer door bucks and dents! Everyone jumps! 
WHAM-WHAM-WHAM! 
QUICK-CUT TO: 
INT. SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY 
Over the headsets, Rizzo and Kkinsa hear the SCREAMS. 
RIZZO Damnit, he's got them. 
Kkinsa keeps trying the code box. Nothing. 
KKINSA Rizzo, I think Yllo must have done something. The door won't open. 
INT.  LAB ONE 
YLLO It's alright. He can't get in here! 
WHAM! WHAM!!! But the door is starting to give. 
Through the confusion, Crutch moves to one of the consoles. Clicks away at the keyboard. 
INT.   SHUTTLE DOCKING BAY 
The shuttle hums to life. 
KKINSA The power's back up! 
RIZZO Then open the doors! 
KKINSA Thirty seconds. 
INT.   LAB ONE 
WHAM! WHAM! WHAM! 
JANESSA What do we do?!! 
YLLO Crutch? 
CRUTCH Help me up. 
Boeman helps Crutch to the top of a table. Crutch goes to work on a ceiling vent, removing screws. 
JANESSA Okay, I'm guessing you should hurry. 
The top corner of the door bends...Jason peers through.

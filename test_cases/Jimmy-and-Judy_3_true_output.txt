JIMMY I still can't tell. 
JUDY (O.C.) I wear a full B cup. 
JIMMY Show me.    Take em out. 
JUDY (O.C.) I am not going to take them out! You take yours out. 
JIMMY It's already out. 
Judy tilts the camera down. 
IN A FLASH we see a lifelike dildo sticking out of Jimmy's fly, a smiley face sticker covers the head. The camera quickly shakes and spins off the image as Judy screams bloody fucking murder. 
Jimmy laughs. Judy forgets the camera is on. She drops it into her lap, fabric from her clothes covers the frame. 
We can hear Jimmy and Judy laughing hysterically. 
JUDY (O.C.) I can't believe you did that. 
JIMMY (O.C.) That's why I did it. Now come on. I showed you mine, let me see yours. 
We hear the rustling of Judy's clothing. Camera falls to her feet on the floor of the car. There's silence. Off camera, Judy's nervously showing Jimmy her breasts. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Wow.    Give me the camera. 
JUDY (O.C.) No. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Please, pretty, pretty please with sugar on top. 
Judy grabs the camera. It's pointing in Jimmy's direction, but she still doesn't realize it's on. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Here, I'll pull over. 
Jimmy pulls over to the side of the road then takes the camera. Jimmy frames up Judy. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Let me see 'em. 
Judy has a naughty and flirtatious smile. 
In the blink of an eye she suddenly lifts up her shirt and exposes her bra, then pulls her shirt back down. 
Jimmy protests. 
JIMMY (O.C.) That doesn't count. Come on, for real this time. 
JUDY I'm embarrassed. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Don't be.    You can trust me. 
Judy's not sure.   Jimmy looks into her eyes, pouring it on. 
JIMMY (O.C.) You can. You can trust me with your life. 
Judy looks at him with a sense of admiration then hope. 
JIMMY (O.C.) (gently) Please. 
Judy gets the same sexy, naughty smile and lifts up her shirt exposing the bra, keeping it there. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Will you take off your bra? 
Judy looks nervous but gives in. She unhooks her bra from the front and exposes her naked breasts for as long as she can. Jimmy focusses the camera's attention on them. It's too much for her. She quickly pulls her shirt back down. 
Jimmy tilts up to a close up of Judy's face. 
JUDY (struggling) I just realized something. 
Judy's eyes are starting to well up as she tries not to cry. 
JIMMY (O.C.) What's the matter? 
JUDY I just showed you my breasts and I saw your penis and we haven't even kissed. 
She starts tearing up. 
JUDY You haven't even asked me to be your girlfriend and I did that. I'm a slut. (wiping her eyes) I don't want to be a slut. 
Jimmy sees she's crying. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Will you be my girlfriend? 
JUDY Yes. 
JIMMY (O.C.) Can I kiss you? 
JUDY (sniffling) Yes. Will you turn off the camera? 
JIMMY (O.C.) I want this moment to be captured forever. I'd rather not kiss you at all than waste the opportunity to document the most beautiful moment of my life. 
Judy leans towards Jimmy, then suddenly attacks him and shoves the camera to the side. They are making out exuberantly. The camera shakes and wobbles. We can hear heavy breathing and the two of them smashing up against the interior of the car. 
Jimmy finally has the camera in position. He has one of his arms extended and now we can see the two of them kissing.

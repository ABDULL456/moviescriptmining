CUT TO: 
INT. WHITE SPACE - DAY 
Nathan talks. 
NATHAN Then Puff shot me. Then I died. That's all I know. That's the end of my story. Do I get to go to heaven now? (beat) Or is it... hell? (beat) Or... what? (beat) I just stay here, is it? I just stay here and tell it again? And after that? Again? And after... (sighs) Yes. Yes, of course. (sighs, clears his throat) 
We move into an extreme close-up. 
NATHAN (beginning again) I don't even know what sorry means anymore. It's odd. When I was alive I knew -- maybe it was all I knew... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. FOREST - DAY 
Lila runs to Nathan. She kneels beside him. 
LILA He's dead. 
PUFF (calmly) We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows. 
LILA (beat, then quietly) No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody. 
PUFF Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you. 
LILA Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life. 
PUFF I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad. 
LILA No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail. 
PUFF (beat) Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us. 
LILA (tearing up) That's what I'm counting on. 
PUFF (an idea) But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind. 
LILA (shrugs) Okay. If you think it will help. 
CUT TO: 
INT. JAIL - DAY 
Lila, now in prison coveralls, sits in a dayroom with other women convicts. She is watching a TV mounted on the wall. 
Puff is testifying. 
PUFF And so, gentlemen, that is my story. I agreed to testify before this committee because I hoped to convey to the American public that there is indeed a paradise lost. Human beings have become so enamored of their technologies and their intellectual prowess and their fancy gourmet foods, that they've forgotten to look to the Earth as a teacher. This is hubris, my friends. And my story of destruction and betrayal is proof of that. I will keep my promise to Lila. I will shed this suit and go back into the wilderness. I will live out my days naked and free. 
CONGRESSMAN Thank you, sir. Your story has touched us all deeply. We will pass some legislation addressing this problem. 
PUFF Thank you. That is all I ask. (to camera) Good-bye, Lila. I take you with me in my untamed heart. 
Puff stands and exits the auditorium. Flashbulbs flash. 
In the prison common room, Lila wipes a tear from her eye. 
She seems genuinely happy. She looks out a small barred window and sees a bluebird light there, then fly away. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY 
Puff walks along, a man on a mission. As he walks he sheds articles of clothing. He is followed by reporters and cameramen and celebrity hounds. Soon he is naked. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY 
Puff walks along, naked. People cheer from porches.

{"train": "R U N A W A Y   B R I D E \nScreenplay by Sarah Parriott & Josann McGibbon \nFADE IN \nEXT. AN IMPOSSIBLE EXPANSE OF MARYLAND FARMLAND - DAY \nThe wind rustles the endless field of corn, blows over the freshly mown meadow of soybeans, and magically sways a copse of trees. \nIt's a Fall after-noon. A SUDDEN POUNDING OF GALLOPING HOOVES breaks the peace and... A HORSE and RIDER burst between the rows of corn into the meadow.  They are running for their lives. \nCLOSE ON: \nThe rider is a bride -- a beautiful woman dressed in a disheveled wedding gown, it's train tattered and flying like a knight's banner out behind her. This is MAGGIE CARPENTER. \nThe horse is frothing and wild-eyed, like the bride, who turns to look behind her in terror.  The horse's labored breathing mingles with Maggie's panicked gasps. \nWe see a WEDDING BOUQUET fly into a ditch as the horse thunders on.  Maggie clings to the reins.  She looks as though she is running from the devil himself. \nFADE TO BLACK \nEXT. IKE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nEstablishing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. IKE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY - ESTABLISHING SHOT \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY \nIKE (V.O.) Hey, Fisher, pick up.  I have some column ideas I want to bounce off you. Not there?  Okay.  Listen I'm thinking of writing about those mind-numbing informercials that are always on. \nIke walks out of his apartment building talking on cell phone. \nIKE (cont'd) What do you think?  Good idea, right? Boring, down to death, pointless -- It sucks. \nIke yells at a CONSTRUCTION WORKER. \nIKE (cont'd) If you guys are here any longer, they're gonna make you sign a lease. \nCONSTRUCTION WORKER Your column should be so funny. \nIke turns and walks down the street, talking into cell phone. \nIKE Okay, I was also thinking I might write about... \nHe spots a RICH LADY with tons of diamonds getting out of a Limousine, talking to a CHAUFFEUR.  He goes up to her. \nIKE (cont'd) Excuse me.  I was thinking of doing an article on limousines.  What would you say to people who never had a chance to drive in a limo? \nThey walk up to her DOORMAN. \nLADY I'm sorry, I don't know any people like that. \nIke walks off.  They stare at him as he goes. \nEXT. ANOTHER NEW YORK STREET - DAY \nIke's talking on the phone to his friend's machine again. \nIKE (into phone) Fisher?  Come on -- I know you're sitting there laughing at me.  Pick up. I want to run an idea past you. \nIke continues walking now in the full panic of writer's block. He pleads into his friend's answering machine as he walks. \nIKE (cont'd) (into phone) I just could use someone to toss it back and forth with for a few minutes, get the juice flowing, help me.  I have an hour and twenty-seven minutes and fifty-two seconds.  Hello? \nHe walks away from the t-shirt table towards the bar.  The Vendor calls out to him. \nT-SHIRT VENDOR Hey, Ike, when are you going to put me in an article? \nIKE When your t-shirts stop shrinking. \nIke enters the bar.  The Woman drops the shirt she was holding and walks off with her children.  The T-shirt Vendor goes back to selling his shirts. \nINT. NEW YORK BAR - LATE DAY \nIke sits at the bar speaking to an attractive Woman nearby, a MAN puts is USA Today on the bar and addresses the BARTENDER. \nMAN I see photos of a lot of dead writers on these walls.  Got any living ones? I have a story to tell that could win one of them a Pulitzer. (then, with enthusiasm) Picture this, if you will.  A small town in Maryland, a sleepy little village, within that a hardware store... \nThe Man continues speaking as Ike and the woman continue their conversation. \nWOMAN So what's in store for us in tomorrow's column? \nIKE I don't know yet.  I'm kind of a last- minute man.  Ideas don't flow until an hour or two before deadline. \nIke sits at his computer, cassette player with Miles Davis PLAYS next to him as he types away reading his handiwork to himself. \nIKE (reading) \"Today is a day of profound introspection, I have been accused of using this column to direct bitter diatribes at the opposite sex!  This uncomfortable accusation has plunged me into at least fifteen minutes of serious reflection, from which I have emerged with the conclusion that, yes -- I traffic in female stereotypes.\" \nEXT. USA TODAY OFFICE - DAY \nFISHER walks through the main office reading the paper. \nFISHER \"But how can one blame me when every time I step out my front door I meet fresh proof that the female archetypes are alive and well?  Te mother, the virgin, the whore, the crone; they're elbowing you in the subway, stealing your cabs, and overwhelming you with perfume in elevators.\" \nINT. USA TODAY OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nElaine at her desk reads aloud to herself. \nELAINE \"But perhaps, in fairness to the fairer sex, I do need to broaden my horizon and add some new goddesses to the pantheon: I would like to nominate for deity...\" \nFisher hands a file to Elaine. \nFISHER \"... The cheerleader, the coed, and the man-eater, the last of which concerns me most today.\" \nFisher leaves and we hold a USA Today sign. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY \nThe Man comes out of the men's room reading the USA Today, Kevin, the Bartender, stands on the bar reading the same article. \nMAN (reads) \"To be fair, the man-eater isn't exactly new.  In Ancient Greece, this fearsome female was known as Erinys, the devouring death goddess.  In India, she is Kali, who likes to devour her boyfriend Shiva's entrails while her yoni devour his -- dot dot dot, never mind.  In Indonesia, the bloody-jawed man-eater is called Ragma...\" \nTe Man sits at the bar near to the Bartender. \nBARTENDER You noticed these are all countries without cable. (then, continues reading) \"... And in Hale, Maryland where she helps run the family hardware store. She is known as Miss Maggie Carpenter (mispronounces) \".... AKA, the Runaway Bride.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - DAY \nWORKERS read the above article. \nINT./EXT. BEAUTY PARLOR / HALE, MARYLAND - DAY \nPEGGY and MRS. PRESSMAN exit the parlor and stroll down the street. (lowers her paper and reads.) \nPEGGY (cont'd) \"... And in Hale, Maryland where she helps run the family hardware store.\" (to the Women) We have to go to Maggie.  Cindy, mind the shop. (exits salon; continues reading) \"... She is known as Miss Maggie Carpenter, AKA, the Runaway Bride.\" \nMRS. PRESSMAN Holy moly. \nThe older one, Mrs. Pressman, listens with a pained expression as the younger one, Peggy, continues to read the column aloud. Neither one can believe what they're reading. \nPEGGY (reads) \"What is unusual about Miss Carpenter is that she likes to dress her men up as grooms before she devours them.  She has already disemboweled six in a row by leaving them at the altar.\"... I can't ready anymore. \nMRS. PRESSMAN (takes paper from her, reads) \"And her ritual feast continues as she prepares to make a sacrifice out of the seventh fiance.  So all bets are on and we hope that this boomerang bride isn't honeymooning with Las Vegas odds makers because many predict that this girl is out of there before the race... before the rice hits the ground\" (then) Holy moly. \nPeggy and Mrs. Pressman step into a hardware store. \nINT. HARDWARE STORE - CONTINUOUS \nPeggy and Mrs. Pressman enter, worried. \nMRS. PRESSMAN You tell Maggie. \nPEGGY No, you tell her. \nMRS. PRESSMAN No, no.  You're her best friend. \nPEGGY No. \nMRS. PRESSMAN (holding her newspaper) You know, it's just possible that she hasn't read this yet. \nPEGGY Yeah. \nMRS. PRESSMAN Maybe she hasn't read the paper... \nOn the counter, they see a copy of USA Today opened to the article about Maggie. \nMRS. PRESSMAN (cont'd) ... Or not! \nWe follow MAGGIE down the back stairs inside The Hale Hardware Store, the prettiest, most welcoming shop of its kind anywhere in small town USA.  Somehow the place ha taken on the spirit of the owner's daughter; both stop and shop-girl radiate brightness, charm, and possibility.  Maggie comes down steps with a faucet handle and goes to an elderly customer, MR. PAXTON. \nMAGGIE (bright) Here we go!  One antique hot water handle with the \"HOT\" still on it, guaranteed to fit any American Standard cast iron tub with a four-inch center made between 1924 and 1938.  In other words, I think you're out of the doghouse with Mrs. Paxton. \nMR. PAXTON (amazed) Hallelujah. \nMAGGIE Alright, Mr. Paxton, I'll put it on your account. \nMaggie rounds the bend, another customer, EARL, stands by the paint machine. \nIke drives down picturesque Main Street.  He passes Hale Hardware.  Sign says: \"At Curl.  Be back soon.\" \nEXT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - DAY \nA BARBERSHOP QUARTET is singing in front of the only hotel in town.  Ike pulls up and goes inside. \nINT. LOBBY/ATLANTIC HOTEL - DAY \nIke has checked into the Atlantic Hotel.  The clerk, LEE, hands him his key.  Ike asks about room service and the restaurant. An OLDER WOMAN asks him if he plays bridge as he goes up the stairs to his room. \nEXT. HALE MAIN STREET - DAY \nIke exits his hotel as the Barber Shop Quartet finishes singing \"Camptown Races.\" \nHe now walks down the charming main artery of the town, looking exactly like what he is:  a cynical New York out of his element on sunny Main Street, USA.  KIDS ride by on bikes, streaming balloons behind them.  A balloon hits Ike on the face.  As he crosses the street, he mutters into his tape recorder: \nIKE I think I'm in Maryberry. \nFlags hang on all the storefronts and the place sparkles with wholesome attitudes as PEOPLE greet each other familiarly.  Ike comes to beauty parlor called \"Curl Up and Dye\".  The place is doing business and crowded with WOMEN. \nINT. BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY \nCindy, the manicurist, does Mrs. Pressman's nails.  Maggie sits on the floor next to Peggy's salon chair, fixing the base of a barber chair.  She tightens a screw and looks up, satisfied. Cindy's dog is on the floor near Maggie. \nMAGGIE Cindy, you better 86 Sprout.  He seems to be enjoying the petroleum distillates. \nCindy rolls over in her chair, picks up her dog and rolls back to her station. \nCINDY That's it.  Back to obedience school. \nMAGGIE (to Peggy) Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully. \nPeggy sits in the chair.  Maggie spins her around and around. \nPEGGY (delighted as she spins) You're a goddess! \nMAGGIE I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid. \nPEGGY Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me. \nJUST THEN.  Ike enters the salon, taking off his sunglasses. Peggy hops off the chair. \nIKE Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street... \nPEGGY Are you a reporter? \nIt's a little early in the game for Ike to be thrown off guard. \nIKE (shocked) What? \nPEGGY (eyeing his loafers) It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie. \nIKE About her upcoming wedding and all. \nPEGGY No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired. \nIke smiles down at his loafers and shrugs. \nIKE I am just such a reporter.  And you are? \nPEGGY Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater. \nPeggy steps aside.  Ike moves toward Cindy and Mrs. Pressman. \nIKE And who are these lovely ladies? \nTe ladies shake his hand and introduce themselves. \nCINDY Cindy.  Maggie's unmarried cousin. \nMRS. PRESSMAN Mrs. Pressman.  No relation. \nPEGGY And you are? \nIKE (turning toward her) Looking for Maggie. \nPEGGY Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you. \nMaggie looks over from her sitting position on the floor.  She gives Ike the once-over, focusing on the shoes. \nMAGGIE (yelling to Peggy) Reporter? \nPEGGY Yup! \nIke crouches to see Maggie on the floor just as she rises to her feet.  Ike straightens up.  For a moment, he is thrown by her beauty and intelligent eyes. \nMAGGIE I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered. \nPEGGY No, she's talking about your hair. \nMaggie swivels his chair so that Ike faces the mirror.  Ike looks at his brightly colored hair. \nMAGGIE You're all ready for football season, Mr. Graham. \nIke stares at his hair in total confusion.  With icy calm, Ike rises from his chair and primps the end of his hair as if giving it the finishing touches.  Then he sees his defaced newspaper clipping and all becomes clear.  He picks up the article and shows it to everyone.  Ike does a slow burn. \nIKE Yes, I think I nailed the personality profile of the women of Hale. \nIke turns and puts the clipping up on the mirror. \nIKE (cont'd) (to Peggy) My jacket, please. \nPeggy hands him his jacket. \nIKE (cont'd) (sarcastically) Thank you. \nIke moves toward the door.  He spots Pete. \nIKE (cont'd) (putting on jacket; to Pete) Excuse me, Pete, do you know a place that sells shampoo... Strong shampoo? \nPETE Doc's Pharmacy.  Third and Elm.  Tell him Pete sent you.  Want my hat? \nIKE No thanks. \nIke smiles at Maggie and exits. \nMAGGIE (to Peggy) He seems crabby. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nIn front of beauty salon, Maggie follows Ike out. \nMAGGIE If you're looking for Elm Street, it's that way. \nShe puts on her sunglasses. \nIKE Thank you. \nHe walks the other way. \nMAGGIE If you came down here in the pursuit of happiness, you might as well go back. Because you can't make me feel bad. \nShe stops walking and turns to Ike. \nIKE I'm not here to make you feel bad.  I'm here for vindication.  In my heart... \nMAGGIE You have one? \nIke walks back to Maggie. \nIKE I feel I'm right about you.  You got me fired, lady.  You destroyed my reputation and you screwed up my hair. You chew men up, spit them out and loved it.  And I'm down here to satisfy myself on that point. \nPASSERSBY stare at Ike's hair and giggle. \nMAGGIE Did something happen to make you care about reality? \nIKE Yes.  Conviction.  Conviction that I'm onto the truth.  You're going to do the same thing to \"poor bastard number four\" that you did to the last three.  You're going to run again.  And I'm not leaving until you do. \nMAGGIE You're going to be very disappointed. \nIKE We'll see. \nMAGGIE I'd love to stay and chat, but I've got to get back to work.  I still have my job. \nHe stares at her for a beat, stung by her words. \nMAGGIE I have nothing to hide, Mr. Graham. Talk to whoever you want.  You might actually stumble upon a fact or two. \nMaggie walks away.  Ike walks a few steps and stops at a KID on a bike. \nIKE Hey, kid, I'll give you ten bucks for your hat. \nKid agrees.  Ike puts the hat on and starts to cross the street. An OLD WOMAN walks by and hits him with a newspaper.  Ike is stunned. \nEXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DUSK \nMaggie pulls into the driveway in her truck.  She's in a fine mood as she walks right in the house. \nINT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DUSK \nBob, Walter, and Maggie's GRANDMOTHER JULIA sit in the living room.  Grandma is sewing one of Maggie's wedding veils.  Walter drinks wine, Ike wears a hat. \nWALTER You know, when I only see one dog, I know I've had too much to drink. \nMAGGIE Not this one.  This one's on me. \nWalter reacts. \nIKE That's fair. \nMAGGIE Despite what you think, I don't do it on purpose.  And I have no intention of doing it again. \nBOB That's right, Maggie.  Just keep your eye on the ball. \nIke raises his eyebrows in question.  Bob explains. \nBOB (cont'd) Sports psychology.  It was my major in college. \nIKE Ahh. \nBOB (false modesty) I'm the town's unofficial fitness trainer.  Big advocate of the mind and body combining for success.  You could say or you can quote me, I'm a glass half full king of guy. \nMAGGIE (boasting) Bob's the head of the P.E. department at the high school.  And he coaches the football team.  And he's climbed Everest. \nTo Maggie's satisfaction, Ike shoots Bob a look of begrudging respect.  Nobody who's been up Everest is a total clown. \nIKE (impressed) Everest.  Is that right? \nMAGGIE Twice... \nIKE Really? \nMAGGIE (sticking it to Ike) Without oxygen... \nBOB My girl likes to brag about me. \nBob and Maggie kiss Ike two little love-birds. \nBOB (cont'd) I'm taking her trekking on Annapurna on our honeymoon. \nIke is highly amused. \nIKE How romantic. \nMAGGIE (sharply) We think so. \nIKE Nothing like sharing your nuptial bed with two Sherpas and a yak. \nWalter cracks up, Maggie shoots Ike a look.  He smiles back. \nCUT TO: \nINT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM/INT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S BEDROOM (NYC) \nINTERCUT TELEPHONE CONVERSATION \nFisher and Ellie are exercising.  Fisher is on a cycle machine. Ellie does yoga stretches.  Ike sits back on the couch, puts on his glasses and watches a video taped wedding playing on the TV screen.  Superimposed titles read \"Brian Norris wedding.\" \nIKE (to Fisher; into phone) You won't believe what I'm looking at, Fisher.  A videotape of all three train wrecks. \nTHE TV - CLOSE \nTwo flower girls and Peggy enter a crowded church where the groom, Brian, and his best man wait at the altar. \nNow we see Maggie come down the aisle, then walk past the altar. We see Maggie move away another aisle and out of the church. SHOCKED WEDDING GUESTS rise in horror, as she runs from this first wedding.  She drags the train boy up the second aisle as she leaves.  Ike hangs up.  He gets up to pick up the remote and then sits back down to watch. \nThe tape fast-forwards to the next wedding.  Now Ike is looking at a much more relaxed, hipper, backyard wedding.  It says, \"Gill Chavez Wedding\".  He hits the fast-forward button (sometimes slowing down). \nON TV: \nWe see the Carpenter's backyard.  It is Gill and Maggie's wedding day.  The yard is crowded with a MIXTURE of Hells Angels-types, Deadheads and townspeople.  The \"altar\" is a band platform against the back fence. \nGill is waiting on the platform with a rock combo playing Grateful Dead-type music.  He makes an introductory speech. \nMaggie steps out onto the back porch.  She's beautiful in a hippie-type wedding ensemble.  She walks with her father to a trampoline.  We can see her tattoo.  She jumps on the trampoline, then dives into the crowd.  They watch her and body surf her over their heads to the back fence. \nAs she hits the stage, she looks at Peggy and Gill, then decides to go.  She jumps off the stage and runs up to a passing GUY on a dirt bike.  She jumps on and turns and waves as she rides away.  During the video, Ike scribbles: \"Gill Chavez\".  Maggie goes off on dirt bike.  The tape fast-forwards to the last of Maggie's fiascoes. \nON IKE'STV \nHe now sees the third wedding.  It's outdoors, in a tree lined area, MUSICIANS plays.  Ike laughs as he discovers that Maggie approaches the altar on horseback, in a simple white dress, wearing a crown of flowers.  The Maid Marian look.  Ike slows the tape. \nON TV:  IT SAYS, \"GEORGE SWILLING WEDDING\". \nAs Maggie rides down the aisle, suddenly the horse whinnies! \nMaggie has kicked it in the shins.  It rears and bolts, galloping off with the bride.  Ike FREEZE FRAMES the tape on an image of Maggie, hair blowing.  Although she is panic-stricken, her soul seems to shine through in tat single frame.  As Ike stares at her, the smirk fades from his face.  He just looks at her, allowing himself to see her expression, her eyes.  He can't help it. \nShe gets to him.  Ike gets a restless look on his face.  He stares closely.  The groom is George from the bar. \nIKE Kamikaze! \nMRS. TROUT (handing him the other bag) Your two cinnamon rolls. \nIKE Bye, Betty.  Thanks. \nHe leaves. \nMAGGIE He's not a nice person. \nMaggie hands Mrs. Trout her bride and broom figures.  Maggie looks at Mrs. Trout, suddenly nervous.  She dashes out.  Mrs. Trout imitates Ike bamming the bride and groom, laughing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FIELD - DAY \nVarious High School SPORTS TEAMS practice.  Maggie strides across the football field, a scowl on her face.  A few HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PLAYERS job past Maggie, doing laps.  A boy, KENDALL, calls out to her affectionately as she passes.  One of them, DENNIS, slows his pace to run alongside Maggie. \nDENNIS (playful) Maggie, don't marry Coach!  Marry me. I love you. \nMAGGIE You're jail bait, Dennis.  Go away. Run your laps.  Go. Go. \nDennis runs on as Maggie continues toward her goal: Bob and Ike, standing together on the other side of the field. \nANGLE ON BOB AND IKE \nThey're both standing on the blocking sled.  Wave after wave of VARSITY FOOTBALL PLAYERS ram into the sled and drive it across the field with both Ike and Bob on top of it.  Ike is munching on one of the cinnamon rolls as Bob pushes the KIDS. \nBOB Drive!  Drive!  From your hips, get low, get low, get low.  Next! \nIke smiles broadly atop of the sled as he sees Maggie approaching, looking mighty peeved.  He nudges Bob and points to Maggie.  Bob lights up at the sight of her. \nBOB (cont'd) Good job, gentlemen... Special teams. \nThe football players move away from the sled.  Bob moves to Maggie, leaves Ike alone. \nBOB (cont'd) (to Maggie) Hey, honey! \nBob kisses and embraces Maggie.  She doesn't see Ike immediately, then: \nMAGGIE (indicating Ike) What is he up to now? \nBOB Ike just came by to check out the team. \nIKE And talk about you. \nIke grins and shows Maggie the notes in his pocket. \nMAGGIE Bob -- are you making friends with this man? \nBOB I'm just bragging about how great you are.  I'm the luckiest man alive. \nBob grabs Maggie around the waist and smooches her adoringly. Maggie scowls at Ike.  He nods, all charm. \nIKE Well -- I've got to get moving -- lot of work to do today!  I'll see you two love-birds later. \nIke leaves.  Bob calls after him. \nBOB See you at the wedding. \nIKE You bet ya, Coach. \nMaggie is aghast.  She stares at Bob.  Ike joins in behind a line of peppy cheerleaders. \nMAGGIE At the wedding?  You invite him?  Bob, don't you realize he's writing another article about me? \nBOB Sure I do.  But the bet defense is a good offense, right?  You're not going to let your opponent throw you off your game. \nMAGGIE You don't understand this guy. \nBOB Let him come to the wedding.  You're not running, right?  Say it. \"I'm not...\" \nMAGGIE (irritably) I'm not running. \nBOB So if you're not running and Ike Graham is there to see it, then any article he writes has got to have a happy ending, right?  All we're doing is turning lemon into lemonade. \nMAGGIE I've got news for you.  No amount of sugar and water is going to turn like Graham into something you want to take on a picnic. \nBob gives Maggie a big hug. \nBOB Where's that homemade sunshine? \nBob blows his whistle, then puts Maggie on the football sled. \nBOB (cont'd) I want you boys to take my princess on the ride of her life... Honey, tell 'em where you parked your car. \nMaggie screams as the boys push her down the football field. \nINT. CONFESSIONAL BOOTH/CHURCH - DAY \nMAGGIE (tenderly) I'm really sorry that I hurt you, Brian. \nBRIAN I'm happy here, where I'm supposed to be.  But if you ever become a Catholic, may I ask you a favor, Maggie? \nMAGGIE Of course. \nBRIAN Could your confess to Father Patrick from now on? \nMAGGIE Of course. \nAnd she scampers out.  Brian goes back into the confessional. \nEXT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY \nMaggie drives up to an old brick firehouse that is now an auto garage.  The faded sign reads: \"Gill's Garage\". \nINT. GILL'S GARAGE - DAY \nMaggie rushes inside and looks around.  No one is in sight. Several cars, including a yellow jeep-like car up on a hydraulic lift, are in the funky garage. \nMAGGIE Gill?  Lydia?  Gill? \nA CRASH, coming from the nearby back room, we hear loud muttering in Spanish, then out stumbles GILL CHAVEZ, 34, wearing a grease- stained Grateful Dead tie-dyed T-shirt.  He grins triumphantly, worshipfully cradling a CASSETTE TAPE in his hands. \nGILL Hey -- I found it! \nMaggie regards her former fiance with patient warmth. \nMAGGIE Found what? \nGill looks up and gives Maggie a fond, hazy smile. \nGILL Mags!  Hey, look -- The tape from the Radio City Music Hall concert -- Remember that night I as trying to get Jerry to let me sit in on \"Ripple\"? \nHe pulls out the cassette from its case.  It's broken.  The tape is dangling from the cassette. \nGILL (cont'd) (disappointed) Oh, I'll play it for you. \nGill picks up an electric GUITAR and starts to play. \nMAGGIE (shouts over the music) Listen, Gill -- There's this reporter who's ben making my life a living hell ... If he comes by here, don't talk to him.  And whatever yo do.... (crosses to Gill) ... Don't show him that picture of me at the concert in San Francisco -- \nSuddenly, a loud CHUCKLING emanates from the car overhead. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) What was that? \nMaggie stops Gill from playing.  She shoots her ex an angry glare and moves a lever on the shop wall.  With a HUM, the car descends. \nGILL We went to San Francisco twice. Remember one time we had a flat tire... Which picture? \nAs the hydraulic lift slows, the car is lowered, revealing Ike sitting in the driver's seat.  He has been enjoying the photograph he's holding. \nIKE (feigning shock) Imagine!  Maggie Carpenter topless in a public arena. (checks photo again) And I see there was a chill in the air. \nMaggie swipes for the photo, but Ike is faster at pulling it away. \nMAGGIE Give me that! \nIKE But the most interesting thing here is that I don't see the rose tattoo that I've heard about on your back. \nGill takes off his guitar and sets it down. \nGILL Ike bet me fifty bucks you don't still have it, Mags.  I said \"You're on, man! Maggie loved that thing!\"  And I could really use fifty bucks. \nMaggie is conspicuously silent. \nGILL (cont'd) (looking worried) Mags? \nMAGGIE I'm not gonna show you guys anything. I am a soon-to-be-married woman.  Now give me that photograph. \nMaggie seethes. \nIKE Sure, I would love to give this to you. Just give us one quick gander at that rose, and, I'll gladly hand it over. \nShe tries to grab the photo again.  Ike pulls it away. \nMAGGIE Fine.  Here. \nMaggie quickly turns around and pulls down the back of her shirt, revealing the top of her back and a pristine expanse of skin.  No tattoo. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) (turning back around) Satisfied? \nIKE Completely. \nGill is still trying to grasp the meaning of this. \nGILL Maggie?  You got it removed? \nPEGGY Okay, that's fine.  I can do that. \nIke comes up to Peggy. \nIKE Hello, Peggy Phleming, \"not the ice-skater\". \nIke indicates the seat next to Peggy. \nPEGGY (protesting weakly) That's Maggie's seat... \nIke sits down comfortably. \nIKE ... And this is Maggie's beer. \nHe starts drinking it.  ON THE FIELD, Cory is getting ready to steal third. \nIKE (cont'd) That your  husband out there?  Cory Phleming, a local radio announcer. \nPEGGY Have you listened to his morning show, \"Wake up with ballplayer\"? \nIKE Not yet.  I had a phlemless morning.  I hear he's a pretty good ballplayer. \nPEGGY This game is pretty important to him. He made all-stars in high school, you know. \nIKE That must have made you proud. \nPeggy takes a small sip off her soda. \nPEGGY He was going with Maggie back then. (quickly) He was never one of her... I mean, they were never going to get... They just dated for a while. \nCory dives in for third and makes it.  The crowd goes wild. Peggy yells and jumps in. \nPEGGY (cont'd) Good job, honey! \nBut Maggie's whoop sails out above it all.  Cory waves.  But not at Peggy.  He directs his delight at Maggie, who jumps up and down by the dugout. \nIke looks between Cory, Maggie and finally, Peggy.  Peggy jerks her waving hand back down to her side and sits down.  Ike pretends not to have noticed.  The two watch as Maggie and Cory smile at each other. \nIKE It's nice that they're still friends. \nPEGGY (looking at Maggie and Cory) Oh, sure.  That was a long time ago. See, she's not a man-hater at all. She's very supportive of men... \nNext BATTER hits one to deep left field and it lands in the grave yard.  Cory scores, greeted by Maggie.  Ike and Peggy watch as Cory and Maggie belly-bump and high-five each other in celebration of Cory's play.  No looks at Peggy.  Ike keeps an empathetic silence, seeing that Peggy is truly hurt. \nPEGGY (cont'd) I'll be back in a second. \nSuddenly, Peggy stands, pushes past him and runs down the steps. Maggie looks up just in time to catch Peggy's exit.  Ike pulls his tape recorder out of his pocket and starts speaking into it. \nMaggie shoots Ike an accusing look, walks up to him in the bleachers and sits next to him. \nMAGGIE You've been here for three minutes. What did you do to her? \nIKE You can turn that finger around. \nIke does an on-the-button imitation of Maggie jumping excitedly at Cory.  Now Maggie sees what he's getting at. \nMAGGIE (defensive) You misinterpret everything.  We've all been friends our whole lives.  But that's the types of relationship you wouldn't understand. \nIKE Obviously, I'm not the only one who doesn't understand it.  The USS Maggie leaves quite a wake... Excuse me. \nIke walks away.  Alone, Maggie tries to seem enthused. \nMAGGIE See, I cheer good.  What is he, a cheer critic? \nEXT./INT. STREET/BAR - LATER - DUSK \nSitting in front of Inn Hale Bar, we see the BARTENDER pantomiming holding the reins of a wildly galloping horse.  We've seen something like this before.  Maggie's wild ride away from her last wedding.  Ike laughs with Bartender just as Maggie drives by the bar and sees this. \nMAGGIE (to herself) This guy never stops. \nINT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - NIGHT \nMaggie walks up to the front desk of the hotel, where Lee is sleeping with his feet up.  She knocks his feet off the counter. \nMAGGIE Lee, hey, wake up.  Give me the key to the reporter's room.  I want to snoop around. \nLEE (handing her the key) Okay.  Second floor. \nMAGGIE Thanks. \nLEE Don't take anything big. \nMaggie moves up the stairs towards Ike's room. \nINT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nMaggie walks towards Ike's room, checks that no one sees her and enters. \nMAGGIE On anything male that moves?  As opposed to anything male that doesn't move? \nPeggy pours her coffee out of its Styrofoam cup into a ceramic mug. \nPEGGY Like certain kinds of coral. \nPeggy sits in the salon chair next to Maggie. \nMAGGIE I'm going to kill myself. \nPEGGY Why? \nMAGGIE Because you think I'm all like... \"Hey man, check me out\". \nPEGGY (friendly) No, I don't think you're like, \"I'm charming and mysterious in a way that even I don't understand and something about me is crying out for protection from a big man like you\".  Very hard to compete with.  Especially to us married women who have lost our mystery. \nMAGGIE But you haven't lost your mystery! You're very mysterious! \nPEGGY No.  I'm weird.  Weird and mysterious are two different things. \nMAGGIE But I'm weird. \nPEGGY No.  You're quirky.  Quirky and weird are two different things. \nMAGGIE Peggy, there's distinct possibility that I might be profoundly and irreversibly screwed up.  Despite that, I love you and I can promise that I will no longer flirt with Cory, and I beg your forgiveness. \nMaggie looks ready to cry. \nPEGGY I'm not worried about you and Cory or Cory and me or even that you're irreversibly screwed up.  But, Maggie, you've been like this since we were kids.  And I think now that you are aware of it and that it hurts people's feelings, maybe it's time to move on with your life and commit to someone of your own, like Bob, if he's the one. \nMAGGIE I think you're right. (then) Is there anything I can do to make it up to you? \nPEGGY Something that brings warmth to my heart. (pause) Duckbill platypus. \nMAGGIE It's only funny at Camp Birchwood at three in the morning at a tick hunt. It's not anymore. \nMaggie makes her funny face.  Peggy doesn't laugh. \nPEGGY You're right.  It's not funny now. Maybe we both grew up. \nMAGGIE Thanks.  Will you fix my hair? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - LATER THAT MORNING \nMaggie exits her house, gets on her bike and rides off towards town. \nINT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER THAT MORNING \nIke is still in bed.  He slowly blinks awake, stretches, and is about to  throw off the covers when Maggie's voice breaks the silence. \nMAGGIE Freeze.  Hold on to those covers -- I didn't come here to see Ike Junior. \nMaggie smiles cheerfully at Ike from the foot of the bed.  He narrows his eyes at her. \nIKE I take it the desk clerk is one of your many admirers. \nMAGGIE (deadpan) How do I do it?  I'm not that beautiful. \nIke notices Maggie is holding two coffees. \nIKE Coffee.  Now. \nMaggie hands it to him. \nMAGGIE You're welcome.  Your notes made interesting bedtime reading -- if you like trashy fiction.  Your observations are distorted, ungrounded an incomplete. You must be very proud. \nIKE I'm not a boastful man.  What's your point? \nIke puts a shirt on as Maggie speaks. \nMAGGIE My point is that one again, you're getting it all wrong.  That won't improve your reputation any, and it's not very flattering to me either.  So, I'm going to give you a chance to write the truth. \nIKE Really. \nMaggie turns away from him as he dresses. \nMAGGIE I've decided to cooperate and let you interview me. (beat) For a thousand bucks. \nIke clears his throat as he stands putting his pants on. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) I want a big wedding and a killer dress and for a grand I will answer all your questions and let you follow me around. \nIke takes his coffee with him as he picks up his glasses, puts them on and crosses to the window. \nIKE My magazine doesn't pay because for stories.  It's not what you call ethical. \nIke sits as he hears Maggie's voice behind him. \nMAGGIE (o.s.) What do you think? \nIke turns around.  Maggie is standing on the pedestal, wearing the dress and looking unbelievably gorgeous.  She is overwhelming to behold and Ike has to struggle to keep his face under control. \nIKE (stammering) You look... uh... You look fine. \nMAGGIE Fine.  The newspaper's upside down. That's better than fine. \nIKE Bob will be very happy. \nShe glows.  Then the moment between them is broken as she suddenly remembers something and grabs the veil off her head. \nMAGGIE Bob!  I almost forgot!  I have to meet Bob! \nINT. DINER - DAY \nThis is a great place -- a major hub of social life in Hale.  The food is greasy and good, Mrs. Pressman is the waitress, and the CROWD the essence of what is wonderful about a small town.  Bob, Maggie and Ike sit on the counter.  Mrs. Pressman CHUFFS about the luau, then moves around the corner. \nBOB Mrs. Pressman, I think we're ready to order. \nMRS. PRESSMAN We're out the special because somebody... (indicates COOK with head) ... didn't order enough sausage. \nBOB Let me have the garden omelette.  Egg whites only. \nIke looks at Maggie.  He'd bet a thousand bucks on what she'd say next. \nMAGGIE I'll have the same. \nIKE (clears his throat) Of course. \nMAGGIE What was that?  I can't order  my eggs without sarcasm? \nBOB Neutral corners you two.  You're on the same team now.  Any more fighting and it's fifteen minutes in the penalty box. (gently, to Ike) Maggie's the nicest person you'll ever meet.  But she's always focusing out there.  She's got to start focusing more in here. (taps his chest) That's why she's had some -- whatever you want to call it -- problems in the past. (to Maggie) That's what we're working on -- focus. Right, Maggie?  Focus on Maggie.  Focus on Bob. \nAs Bob has been talking, Ike has been watching Maggie's face. The joy seems to have drained out of her. \nMAGGIE (quietly) Right. \nBOB (to Ike) I lead Maggie through a visualization exercise.  All the sports shrinks use this head stuff.  Visualize the end zone, if you catch my drift. \nBob takes out a notepad and hands it to Maggie. \nBOB (cont'd) Here's today's mantra: \"It's an open field to Big Bob.\" \nIKE Tell me.  When you get to the altar, will you spike the bouquet? \nMAGGIE You know, there's no... \nBefore Maggie can finish, Ike intercepts her. \nIKE Well, I'm off.  A reporter's work is never done. (heading to the door) Mrs. Pressman, thank you. \nMRS. PRESSMAN Tootaloo. \nINT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - MOMENTS LATER \nGRANDMA JULIA (V.O.) I'd like to explain about the weddings. There are reasons why they didn't come off.  Three weddings, no \"I do's\".  You can't believe how much cake we were left with.  I should weigh three hundred pounds.  I don't think her father minded spending so much money on booze that nobody drank. \nWe hear Grandma as through the hotel doors, we see Maggie exit the diner.  She gets a bag from inside the cab of her truck and comes inside the hotel where she finds Ike talking to Grandma, who is having tea with her friend, NETTA. \nMAGGIE Ike... Hi, Grandma. \nIKE Gram here was going to give me the skinny on why you run from marital bliss. \nGRANDMA JULIA Right, cover your ears, Netta.  It's not that she's afraid of the wedding, she's afraid of the wedding night. Innocent girls are terrified of \"the one-eyed snake\". (getting into it) Why, when I was a virgin bride, I took a knitting needle with me into the bed... \nIke winces. \nMAGGIE Actually, Grandma, I charmed the one- eyed snake awhile ago. \nGRANDMA JULIA Oh, yeah, I forgot.  I'll tell you one thing, your grandpa didn't forget that wedding night. (no Netta) You can take your hands off your ears, Netta.  Your tea's getting cold. \nMAGGIE Can you excuse us a minute? (then to Ike) May I have a word with you, please? \nMaggie moves toward door. \nIKE Bye, Netta... Bye, Grandam. \nHe steps over to Maggie in the doorway. \nMAGGIE I found this and didn't know if it was something interesting. \nMaggie hands Ike a 30-year-old LP: Miles Davis' \"Kind of Blue.\" \nIKE (excited) Oh, my God -- It's Miles Davis.  This is \"King of Blue\"!  This is the original recording.  Hard to find in good condition.  Where did you find this? \nIke and Maggie sit in the steaming car for a moment. \nMAGGIE Your filter's clogged.  This takes unleaded. \nIKE Can you fix it? \nMAGGIE First I have to find some tools.  I need a half and a nine-six-tenth. \nIKE (removing his glasses) Of what? \nMAGGIE (in amazement) Wrenches.  My dad's gonna love that one. \nMaggie slams the food closed. \nIKE Kind of isolated. \nMAGGIE Yeah.  It's kind of nice. \nAn uncomfortable silent pause.  Ike breaks the moment. \nIKE There's one thing we New Yorkers know how to do is hail a cab.  If there's no cab, we walk. \nIke stares off down the road.  Maggie indicates a building in the distance, then turns off the car lights. \nMAGGIE I can get some tools over there.... and save the battery... There's one thing we country girls know how to do is cut across a field.  It's quicker. \nMaggie points diagonally across the field to where a gas station sign glows and the lights from the outer house twinkle. \nHe smiles and follows her into the field. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) Be careful of snakes. \nIKE Snakes?  Are you serious?  I don't like snakes.  I've never even seen a snake. \nHe steps carefully into the field, then hops gingerly toward Maggie. \nMOMENTS LATER \nMaggie leads Ike through a cornfield. \nMAGGIE Do you think there's only one right person for everybody? \nIke chooses his words carefully. \nIKE No.  But I think attraction is too often mistaken for rightness. Attraction is very misleading.  And if it's mutual, it's well, terribly distracting. \nMAGGIE Yes it is.  And it doesn't mean anything. \nIke nods as they come to a wooden fence.  She puts her hand on his shoulder.  Ike puts his hands around her waits to give her a boost over the top.  We see the flicker of misunderstanding cross Maggie's face at the initial contact.  Neither of them moves -- forward or back, but the electricity is obvious. \nANGLE ON:  Ike.  His conflicted feelings are apparent.  With difficulty, Maggie straightens up and they both quickly remove their hands. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) (lightly) I suddenly forgot how to climb a fence. \nThey look at each other for a moment, then: \nMAGGIE AND IKE (breaking the moment jokingly) \"Tools\". \nShe climbs over the fence on her own and Ike follows.  They see an old guy, LIONEL, whittling on a porch. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) Lionel, can I borrow some tools? \nIKE Yeah, we need a half and nine- sixteenths. \nLIONEL Gonna bust out of another wedding? \nIKE You're sure well known around here. \nEXT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S BUILDING - THE NEXT DAY \nEstablishing shot. \nINT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S KITCHEN (NYC) - DAY \nINT. IKE'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nINTERCUT BETWEEN TWO LOCATIONS: \nIke sits on his bed, on the phone, working and eating his breakfast.  He's watching Maggie's wedding tape again.  Fisher is cooking an elaborate breakfast.  Ellie rushes around getting ready for work.  He is on the phone to Ike. \nFISHER (into phone) Yes, well, my theory was that she may be running because she gets attention... Negative attention is attention. Like when women whack you on the street because of your column, that's negative attention. \nIKE (V.O.) This is about her negative attention, not mine.  Did you get the reimbursement for the dress yet? \nFISHER (into phone) No, I'm paying for the dress.  Do you think she's still gonna run? \nIKE (V.O.) I don't know. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET/FISHER AND ELLIE'S BUILDING - DAY \nIke walks down a street toward Ellie and Fisher. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FISHER AND ELLIE'S APARTMENT (NYC) - NIGHT \nEllie is on the phone as Fisher enters with beer.  Ike sits at the piano. \nFISHER (sarcastically) Overpriced nice apartment and Chinese takeout.  That's New York living. \nELLIE (into phone) ... Just call me when you have it. (hangs up, then to Fisher) Ike, how is the story coming?  Is she a man-eater? \nFISHER Or a vegetarian? \nELLIE Or does she pick \"NGB'S\" -- \"Nice Guys, But...\"  Nice guys, but I'm cheap. Nice guys, but he lives with his mom... Nice guys, but he just out of prison. \nIKE No... They're interesting guys.  Each one of these guys has something going for him.  I mean, one's been up Everest. Another's become a priest.  One's a pretty good guitar player.  And this guy today tried to end world hunger, if you can believe that... \nFISHER Whoa, Ike.  Getting a complex, buddy? \nELLIE Fisher, let him talk. \nIKE (sits) But one of those guys -- not one of them -- knew her at all.  Each one was convinced that she was perfect for them, but they didn't see her.  And she never showed up so they couldn't see her. It's a very symbolic thing happening. She becomes what she thinks they wanted to be. \nFisher doesn't like the sound of this.  He glances at Ellie, who is looking very interested. \nFISHER (in shock) Ike is turning sensitive and I can't bear to watch.  I'm going to make a fresh pot of tea. \nThe phone rings as Fisher exits.  Ike goes to the piano as Ellie picks up the phone. \nELLIE (into phone) Yeah... Oh, Jay... Okay... Bye. (hangs up, then yells to Fisher) Fisher, don't forget the fortune cookies. \nShe joins Ike at the piano.  Ike gets serious. \nIKE Is that what I did to you?  Is that what happened?  Did I just not see you? \nELLIE No.  No, you didn't. \nHe hugs her. \nIKE (heartfelt) Well -- I'm sorry, I'm really sorry, Ellie. \nELLIE I'm sorry, too. (beat) Wow.  That only took us between years to say. \nEllie blinks back sentimental tears. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TROUT'S BARN - THE NEXT NIGHT \nWe hear Hawaiian music.  We see a truck with GUESTS drive up and HULA DANCERS through barn slats. \nINT. TROUT'S BARN - NIGHT \nIt's a small barn that's been converted into a luau with a bar. A BAND plays for two hula dancers.  The Trouts had decorated it as a little slice of Hawaii.  There are tiki lights, numerous rented plastic palm trees and fiberglass copies of Hawaiian statuary.  Strings of colored lights crisscross the ceiling. It looks like a Hawaiian high school gym on prom night. \nMaggie's family, Mrs. Trout and people we've already met, and more, are here, milling around wit tropical drinks garnished with umbrellas.  Plastic leis abound and most people have managed to find their old Hawaiian shirts. \nAs we come in, the hula dancers finish their applause and Mrs. Trout announces.  Hula dancers stop. \nLOU TROUT Welcome to our annual country luau.  As you know, Betty and I got married on the rim of the crater, Diamond Head. \nMRS. TROUT (grabbing the microphone) This year, we're dedicating our first dance to the soon-to-be newlyweds, the King and Queen of Hawaii, Maggie and Bob. \nThe couple enters.  Bob is a goody bronzed god in his King Kamahamela outfit.  Maggie is spectacular in her authentic looking Hawaiian Princess get-up.  But her face reflects none of the festivities around her.  Every now and then, she looks up and glances around for Ike, hating herself for it. \nMRS. TROUT (cont'd) King and Queen, dance. \nMaggie and Bob start to dance as the Quarter sings \"Aloha Oe.\" \nMRS. TROUT (cont'd) Everybody dance. \nEverybody dances. \nTIMES OUT: \nMaggie and Bob pose for pictures with some of the guests. \nMRS. TROUT Pictures of the King and Queen. \nDennis poses with Maggie.  Cory poses with Bob.  Mrs. Trout runs out of film and goes to get more, leaving Peggy and Maggie alone. Peggy whispers to Maggie. \nPEGGY Lighten up, wahine. \nMAGGIE Lighten up, what? \nIKE You want me to make a toast?  Okay... I'll give you a toast.  To Maggie's family and friends.  May you find yourselves the bull's eye of an easy target.  May you be publicly flogged for all of your bad choices and may your noses to rubbed in all of your mistakes... \nIke watches their reaction.  The silence is deafening.  All the guests stare at Maggie.  Mortified, she holds back tears. \nMRS. TROUT That was funny. (a pause) But enough toasts, let's hula.  Let's start the music up. \nShe gets everyone up to hula.  Band plays fast tune.  Maggie walks through the CROWD down the steps and outside.  Ike follows, but Peggy grabs a coat for her.  Bob watches her go as Cory approaches. \nCORY Hey, Bob.  I got twenty dollars bet on-- \nBOB Not now. \nBob rushes after Maggie. \nPEGGY (calling after her) Maggie.  Maggie. (to Ike,  handing him a jacket) Here.  She may need this.  It's not really Hawaii. \nIke exits.  Then, Bob comes over. \nBOB Where'd Maggie go? \nPEGGY Oh, she just went to get me something from the car. \nCory comes over with Dennis to Bob and Peggy.  BOB/PEGGY/CORY/ DENNIS CHUFFA:  About Bart Starr and football.  (Which keeps Bob from going outside to follow Maggie).  Bob thinks about it. \nEXT. TROUT'S BARN - NIGHT \nIke runs after Maggie.  He grabs her arm and turns her to him. \nIKE I'm the only goddamn person in there pulling for you. \nMAGGIE You humiliated me! \nIKE No, Maggie, I defended you. Humiliating you is what everyone else is doing.  It's the theme of this party. \nMAGGIE I had it under control.  Now they feel sorry for me. \nIKE Well, they should.  Because they're about to watch you hang yourself again. \nMaggie has no response. \nIKE (cont'd) -- Tell me something, do you really care about Mount Everest? \nMAGGIE It's fun!  It's high. \nIKE Or the sexual habits of locusts? \nMAGGIE That was very interesting research George was doing! \nIKE What kind of Dead Head gets a temporary tattoo? \nMAGGIE I already explained about that. \nIKE And where you ever really going to run the leper colony in Molokai? \nMAGGIE (wincing) Brian told you that? \nIKE Or maybe you just wanted to wear the headdress. \nMAGGIE Every one of those times I was being supportive.  Something you won't understand. \nIKE Supportive?  You weren't being supportive.  You were being scared. Just like now.  You are the most lost woman I have ever laid eyes on. \nMAGGIE Lost! \nIKE That's right.  You're so lost you don't even know how you like your eggs. \nMAGGIE What!? \nIKE With the priest, you liked them scrambled.  With the Dead Head, fried. With the bug guy, poached.  Now it's egg whites only, thank you very much. \nMAGGIE That's called changing your mind. \nIKE No, that's called not having a mind of your own.  What are you doing, Maggie? You really want to let that man drag you up Annapuma on your honeymoon?  You don't want to climb Annapuma. \nMAGGIE Yes I do! \nIKE No you don't.  You want a man who will lead you down the beach with his head over your eyes just so you can discover the feel of the sand under your feet. You want a guy who will take you into a cave with a thousand candles just to read you a poem.  You want a man to wake you up at dawn because he's burning to talk to you and he can't wait another minute to find out what you'll say.  Am I right? \nHe's laid her flat.  Maggie can't speak. \nIKE (cont'd) Am I right? \nShe fights back angry tears. \nMAGGIE Stop.  Stop it!  I'm getting married on Sunday, and you're just trying to make me run!  Why?  Because you're a cynical, exploitative, mean-hearted creep who wouldn't know real love if it bit him in the armpit!  And all you do is tear other people down and-and-and laugh at them, and criticize what they do, because you're too afraid to do anything yourself!  I read your column. You never wrote one about you.  I'm not the only one who's lost and you know it! Am I right?  Well?  Am I right? \nANGLE ON:  Bob comes outside. \nIKE (taking off his jacket) At this pace, it could be an evening wedding. \nBOB Hold it!  Hold it!  I think we're taking this too fast. \nHe begins to pace. \nBOB (cont'd) We need to limber you up a little. You're tensing. (thinks a moment; to Ike, moving him to groom's spot) You stand here and be me so she knows how far she'll have to go. (then to Maggie) I'm going to walk with you. \nBob goes to Maggie and walks behind her. \nBOB (cont'd) Visualize!  Visualize!  It's game time. \nANGLE ON: \nMaggie walking. \nBOB (cont'd) You are the football.  You're spiraling through the air towards the hands of the groom. \nShe proceeds down the aisle.  Bob behind her. \nMAGGIE (eyes down) Yes, I'm spiraling through the air. \nANGLE ON: \nMaggie raises her eyes and sees Ike in front of her as groom. Ike and Maggie lock gazes.  If they had to, they couldn't look away.  All the things unspoken are now communicated -- the love, the longing. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) I streak towards the goal line. \nMaggie's pace quickens. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) And I land on the goal line. \nANGLE ON: \nBob beams to see Maggie's eager arrival at Ike's side.  He switches off the music and proceeds like a proud coach to be the pastor. \nBOB Okay, I'm the pastor.  Dearly beloved, blah, blah, blah.  So on and so forth. Ra ta ta ta.  Yabada dabada.  I now pronounce you man and wife.  Kiss the bride, badum dum. (then moving toward Ted) We have the crescendo that leads to us right back down the aisle and out the... \nIke kisses Maggie.  It is a world class, Olympic kiss.  It is a kiss that changes everything and can never be taken back.  It is a kiss you only get once in your life. \nNEW ANGLE: \nBob's smile dies.  Cindy's mouth drops open as the kiss goes on and on.  Peggy loses control and screams. \nBOB (cont'd) Maggie!!!!? \nLike a bucket of water thrown on two dogs, Ike and Maggie are startled out of their kiss.  They pull apart and smile at each other. \nANGLE ON:  Bob. \nBOB (cont'd) (furious) If you were imagining me, you did great. (to Ike) What the hell were you doing? \nIKE (eyes on Maggie) I'm sorry, Bob.  She kissed me back. \nMAGGIE (dazed but happy) I kissed him back. \nBOB Yeah, I caught that.  Want to tell me how long this has been going on? \nMaggie looks at Ike, wondrous, confused. \nMAGGIE About a minute...? \nIKE A little longer for me. \nMAGGIE Really? \nBOB What do you expect me to say to this? \nIKE How about -- \"I hope you'll be very happy together\"? \nBob hauls back and punches Ike in the face.  Ike drops. \nBOB I hope you'll be very happy together. \nBob storms down the aisle and out of the church. \nMAGGIE (to Peggy) Take care of him. \nMaggie leaves. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CHURCH - THAT MOMENT \nBob is halfway down the walk.  Maggie appears at the church door and calls after him. \nMAGGIE Bob, I'm sorry! (half to herself) At least I backed out before the wedding.  That's progress! \nPEGGY His hair... any color. \nGRANDMA JULIA I like his tight butt. \nPeggy laughs. \nMAGGIE Grandma! \nPEGGY (to Cindy) See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it. \nCUT TO: \nLOVE MONTAGE SHOTS: \nEXT. OCEAN - DAY \nIke and Maggie fishing. \nINT. MAGGIE'S WORKSHOP/HOME - DAY \nThey play ping-pong.  They laugh, enjoying the moment. \nINT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DAY \nIke and Maggie have fun playing cards.  The game is slapjack. \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nMaggie and Ike horseback riding.  They sit on their horses amongst trees, \"nuzzling\".  Ike reads as he pushes Maggie in a tire swing. \nINT. MAGGIE'S ROOM - DAY \nIke and Maggie open and close a Hoberman ball by holding its opposite ends in their teeth.  Grandma looks in. \nINT. MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThere is a fire in the fireplace.  Maggie and Ike sit as Ike shows Maggie some passages from his favorite books.  He's reading something from Yeats at the moment.  They seem happy. \nEXT. CHURCH - THE DAY OF THE WEDDING \nIt is a media circus including FOUR REPORTERS, Midday with Meredith and the T-shirt Vendor.  Plus three other people the reporters are interviewing, a GERMAN LADY, BUTCH KENAN, a farmer and Grandma Julia.  Reporter DINA NAPOLI walks down the church steps. \nDINA NAPOLI (OF WBAL) Wedding bells are ringing for the fourth time today in Hale, Maryland. Maggie Carpenter, \"Always a Bride -- Never a Bridesmaid\", will be attempting to complete her fourth wedding ceremony. We'll come back on the air when the results are in.  Back to you, Jessica. \nMeredith, the low-end public access TV reporter, films himself pointing a cheap video camera himself. \nMEREDITH The turnout for this morning's wedding is usually reserved for royalty or Hollywood stars, but Maggie Carpenter is Hale, Maryland's special star and the citizens of Hale are out in full force today. \nThe NY T-shirt Vendor pitches his wares. \nT-SHIRT VENDOR I got \"Bye-bye Birdie\".  \"What part of 'I do' don't you understand?\"... Get your \"Runaway Bride\" T-shirts here... \nReporter JULIE MURPHY stands near Grandma Julia and Mrs. Pressman. \nJULIE MURPHY (Channel 6) The bride's been here for almost an hour, but being around in the beginning was never her problem.  We'll be here, showing you the full wedding ceremony, we hope. \nReporter JACKI and TIFFANY stand at the edge of the CROWD reporting. \nJACKI/REPORTER #3 (WBOC TV16) Will she or won't she?  That is on the minds of these several hundreds folks, who are standing here this morning. Not to mention on the mind of Groom Number #4, ex-USA Today columnist, Ike Graham, who is missing in action. \nEXT. WINDOW OF CHURCH/INT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM - DAY \nINSERT window of church.  Peggy peers out the window at the carnival scene.  Cindy sits with Maggie as she leans forward, doubled over on a child's chair.  Peggy moves from the window to sit with them. \nMAGGIE (moves to window) He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming. \nPEGGY No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a \"V\". \nMAGGIE You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese. \nPEGGY Not eight... \nCINDY And in a \"V\". \nMAGGIE Eight is good... \"V\" could be Victory. \nThey ad lib various words starting with the letter \"V\".  Maggie is nervous. \nCINDY Rub your ears. \nPEGGY Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate. \nMaggie rubs her ears. \nCINDY We do it to our dog. \nMAGGIE It's hurting. \nHe takes the boutonniere and puts it on Ike's lapel. \nBOB (cont'd) I'm glad it's you. \nIKE Really? \nBOB I didn't want to find out I wasn't for her in the fourth quarter. \nIKE Got any last minute advice? \nBOB (motioning to their eyes) Maintain eye contact. \nBob turns and leaves, going down a side staircase. \nIKE (to himself) Eye contact.  Eye contact. \nOut of the corner of his eye, Ike sees a pictures of Christ on the wall.  He leans into the picture and whispers. \nIKE (cont'd) Cover me. \nHe walks into the chapel. \nINT. CHAPEL - CONTINUING \nIke steps up and stands next to Fisher. \nFISHER (to Ike) I have no idea what I'm doing. \nIKE Your job is... the ring. (to Fisher) Do you have the ring?! \nFISHER I just found out I'm best man!  I'm lucky I have a suit... What's wrong? \nIke gives the ring to Fisher.  The Pastor approaches Ike.  Ike turns away and look out over the guests. \nIKE'SPOV:  There are most of the TOWNSPEOPLE we've come to know, plus some NEW YORKERS for Ike, with little ponytails. Armani wire rims, Donna Karan bodysuits.  There's a lot of smirking, checking out the hicks, forming their stories for cocktail hour.  Elaine is in back all dressed in black, mourning Ike.  Mrs. Trout approaches Ike. \nMRS. TROUT You should thank Lou and I for the wedding car -- a '63 Buick. \nIKE Thank you. \nMRS. TROUT Oh, come on.  You're practically family. \nMrs. Trout starts picking lint off Fisher's jacket. \nFISHER Hello.  I'm Fisher. \nMRS. TROUT This doesn't want to come out. \nFISHER You just pull a hair from my neck. \nIKE Mrs. Trout, go back to your seat! \nINT. CHURCH FOYER - DAY \nPeggy joins Maggie, who is blowing bubblegum and swaying in front of an oscillating fan.  Grandma and Walter come in. Grandma gives her a kiss on the cheek. \nGRANDMA JULIA Good luck, Maggie. \nMAGGIE Thank you, Grandma. \nGrandma leaves.  Walter steps up. \nWALTER (quietly to Maggie) I'm really rooting for this one. \nMAGGIE Thank you, Dad. \nPeggy turns off the fan.  Cindy takes the bag from Maggie. \nCINDY Spit. \nMaggie spits her bubblegum into the bag.  Peggy hands Maggie her bouquet. \nPEGGY Let's go. \nMAGGIE No sauntering down the aisle.  Just make time.  Let's just get there. \nCindy and Peggy nod and leave.  The door closes. \nINT. CHAPEL - CONTINUING \nBoth extends his hand to Elaine. \nELAINE Hi, I'm Elaine from New York. \nBOB Hello.  I'm Bob, Maggie's fourth attempt. \nELAINE I'm sorry. \nIke quietly sits in bed writing and staring into space thinking. His cat sits on the windowsill. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAGGIE'S WORKROOM/GYM - NIGHT \nMaggie jumps rope barefooted late at night. \nMAGGIE I need a plan... A plan to life... What would Bruce Lee do?  He'd kick some ass... \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAGGIE'S KITCHEN - DAY \nMaggie in front of plates full of all sorts of types of eggs -- scrambled, poached, sunny-side up, Benedict, soft boiled, etc -- sits on the kitchen counter.  She ties them all. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - DAY \nEstablishing shot.  Two MEN try to fix the engine of a taxi outside the restaurant. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - DUSK \nEke walks by the T-shirt Vendor, goes into a subway station. \nEXT. ANOTHER STREET - DUSK \nIke crosses a busy street where a MAN is being arrested.  Ike is passing the upscale \"Millennium Hardware Store\".  He glances at the window, looks away, stops and looks again.  The window display is made up of an assortment of Maggie's lamps.  Logo \"MAG\" is on them.  He smiles and walks on. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK RESERVOIR - DUSK \nIke stares out at water as he walks. \nEXT. IKE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nIke walks along sidewalk, crosses street, enters his building. \nINT. IKE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nIke opens the door to his apartment and flicks on the lights.  He crosses to hang his coat in the closet.  In the closet mirror, he sees and is stunned to find:  MAGGIE, sitting on the couch holding Italics, the cat. \nMAGGIE Hello, Ike. \nHe closes the closet and crosses to his desk. \nIKE Don't tell me.  My doorman is one of your many admires... I knew I should have given him a better Christmas gift. \nMaggie smiles tenuously.  She's more than a little terrified. \nMAGGIE I've been making friends with your cat. (then) Is it okay that I'm here? \nIKE I don't have much choice in the matter now, do I?  But I can't speak for Italics. (to Cat) Traitor! \nHe moves to the kitchen. \nMAGGIE I don't blame you for being mad... \nIke looks at her.  Apparently the word \"mad\" is an understatement. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) ... Or... furious. \nIke looks at her again. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) ... Irate?  Livid?  How's that? \nHe starts putting cat food in a bowl.  The cat leaves Maggie's side and starts to east. \nIKE Livid is good.  So what is it, Maggie? You here on business?  I saw your lamps. They're terrific. \nMAGGIE It's something I've always wanted to do. \nIke leaves the kitchen, turns on the balcony lights and re-enters the living room from the balcony. \nIKE You actually could make breaking and entering into a new career. (after opening the glass doors) So, what are you doing here? \nMAGGIE I wanted to talk to you about why I run or ride away from things. \nIke moves away from her and sits on the steps near the balcony window, listening. \nIKE (after sitting) Does it matter? \nMAGGIE I think so... When I was walking down the aisle?  I was  walking toward somebody who didn't have any idea who I really was.  And it was only half the other person's fault, because I had done everything to convince him that I was exactly what he wanted.  So it was good that I didn't go through with it because it would have been a lie, but you -- you knew the real me. \nIKE Yes, I did. \nMAGGIE I didn't.  And you being the one at the end of the aisle didn't just fix that. \n", "test1_input": "ELAINE You can go in now. \nIke goes into Ellie's office.  Elaine picks up her phone. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELLIE'S OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nELLIE is that editor.  Stylish and successful looking, she's about Ike's age.  Ellie sits behind a big desk with a scowl on her pretty face.  Her casual-looking husband, Fisher, sits nonchalantly on the arm of the couch.  Ike enters as Ellie reads Maggie's letter. \nELLIE (reading letter) \"Anyway, I'm just dropping you big city folk this little note to say that I have thought of a ritual sacrifice that would satisfy my current appetite: Ike Graham's column on a platter.  Yours truly, Maggie Carpenter.  P.S. -- I have inclosed a list of the gross factual misrepresentations in your article.  There are fifteen.\" \nIke sits as Ellie puts the letter down and takes off her glasses. \nIKE (chuckles as he sits) Fully.  I like her.  She has wit. \nELLIE I left four messages.  You don't return my calls. \nIKE So?  I never returned your calls, even when we were married.  And what's Fisher doing here anyway? \nFisher gets and places a photo of the cat on a bookshelf on his way to the other side of the room. \nFISHER Ellie asked me to come down to offer moral support. \nIKE Since when does Ellie need moral supp-- \nELLIE -- It's for you, Ike. \nIKE What? \nELLIE Journalism lesson number one.  If you fabricate your facts, you get fired. \nEllie pushes USA Today lawyer's letter across the desk for him to read.  Ike picks it up and skims the letter.  His face is as impassive as stone. \nIKE Lesson number two.  Never work for your former spouse. \nELLIE That's not nothing to do with it.  You cooked this story up and you know it. \nIKE I didn't cook up a story.  I had a source. \nELLIE Someone reliable, I'm sure.  A booze- hound in a bar? \nFISHER In vino veritas. \nIKE Don't knock drunk guys in bars.  Drunk guys in bars are good.  It means they're not driving. \nIke gets up and stands near Ellie, making his point. \nIKE (cont'd) Besides, I'm a columnist.  This is what columnists are supposed to do.  This is what you like.  We push, we stretch, we go out on a limo.  That's what makes me good! \nELLIE No, that's what makes you unemployed. \nIKE I merely write the stuff.  You're the one that serves it up. \nIke puts down the letter and puts his glasses back into his pocket. \nELLIE Not anymore.  I have to draw the line. (pushing a piece of paper) She sent us this list.  Our lawyers say it's actionable. \nEllie hands Ike Maggie's list. \nIKE (scoffs) Lawyers. (glances at list) I don't know, Ellie -- Firing me is going to be very tough on you.  It's going to be hard to get over.  There will be therapy bills for you. \nELLIE (shrugs) I already made an appointment for later today. \nIKE (putting the list down, standing) See?  You want custody of my job? ... Why not just consider my wrist slapped and call me when you feel I've served my time? \nELLIE I'm sorry, Ike.  This is permanent. \nFisher winces and looks away.  Ike and Ellie look at each other for a sober moment. \nELLIE (V.O.; cont'd) If you go quietly, I'll get you severance pay. \nEllie fidgets with her toy rake, then Ike heads for the door. He laughs a little at the painful truth of her words and walks out.  Ellie collapses back in her chair.  Fisher goes to her and rubs her shoulders. \nEXT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - DAY \nIke rides sadly on the back of a forklift, gets off and walks out. \nEXT. HALE RESIDENTIAL STREET - ANOTHER MORNING \nANGLE ON MAGGIE'S HOUSE: \nA train goes by.  A modest clapboard house with a porch.  Two entrances.  A PAPERBOY tosses a paper onto the lawn in front of the house.  The front door opens and Maggie appears fresh out of bed, wearing only a jacket and panties.  Heedless of being seen this way, she scampers out to the sidewalk to pick up her delivered paper:  USA Today.  She tears off the plastic bag and rips into it, looking for her letter.  She finds it.  A smile on her face, then she scampers back into the house. \nINT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - THAT MOMENT \nMaggie skips back into her house which she shares with Father and Grandma.  A cozy and eclectic place creatively furnished on a shoe-string.  She rushes into:  KITCHEN WHERE BOB KELLY, fiance #4, is packing cans into a backpack.  Bob, 38, has a pleasant face and a body that is almost shockingly buff.  He's wearing a T-shirt that reads: \"Mountaineers Do It Against the Wall.\", Maggie dances over, waving the paper and singing. \n", "test1_true": "Bob test the weight of the backpack adding dehydrate food. \nBOB Come here, Mag, and try this on. \nMaggie puts the paper on the kitchen counter and starts to read aloud, paying no mind to Bob, who is sticking her arms through the straps of the backpack. \nMAGGIE Listen: \"Dear Ms. Carpenter, I apologize to you for this unfortunate matter.  Ike Graham's column will no longer be appearing in this paper. Best of luck in you upcoming marriage!\" \nBob continues to hold up the weight of the backpack as he straps it onto Maggie's shoulders. \nBOB That-a-girl!  You sacked him. (checking pack) This is the weight of the pack you're going to have to carry in the Himalayas. Tell me if it's too heavy. \nBob lets go and Maggie FALLS BACKWARD, disappearing behind the counter, and hitting the floor, with a THUD.  Bob looks down at her.  Maggie's voice rises from the floor behind the counter. \nMAGGIE (o.s.) It's a little... It's a little heavy... Help me, baby. \nBob has no answer.  He reaches a hand down.  He yelps as Maggie pulls him down on top of her, out of frame.  We HEAR them giggle and kiss. \nINT. USA TODAY LOADING DOCK - ANOTHER DAY \nFisher uses the dock for a photo shoot featuring men and women in evening and formal wear from Escada for G.Q.  Fisher is not actually shooting the camera, but rather supervising it. Fisher claps his hands and calls the models to attention.  Then he goes onto the stage and sets the models in their positions. \nFISHER (cont'd) Remember, we are putting the \"fun\" back into formal. (to Ike) I just say that for the agency guys.  I don't even know what that means.  Now follow me. \nINT. USA TODAY OBSERVATION ROOM - DAY \nElevator doors open.  Ike and Fisher exit and walk towards the coffee table. \nFISHER Ike, I really liked the Runaway Bride piece, and since I do freelance stuff for G.Q., I'm in a different position now... \nIKE What are you trying to say to me, Fish? \nThey stop walking. \nFISHER Vindication.  How would you like to get some?  A chance to prove that, though your facts weren't entirely straight, your theory was correct. \nIKE (hiding his hope) The real story on Miss Carpenter. \nFISHER All the gory details. \nThey start walking again. \nIKE (excited) The anatomy of the black widow spider of Maryland. \nFISHER It wouldn't be a bad way to get you back into writing feature pieces again. \nIKE (enthusiastically) This is good.  It is a good story, Fish. \nThey stop at the coffee table and grab something to eat. \nFISHER (nods) If she runs, then it's a cover story. All true.  All accurate. \nIKE (confesses) Okay, you were right.  I hated my column, but I can do this assignment. \nFISHER Then you've got it.  If you leave tomorrow for the hinterlands, you'll have plenty of time before her next wedding trot. \nIKE \"Paid vindication\"  That's what I call justice. \nFISHER Justice, yes.  Paid, I don't know. They like the idea, but my hands are tied with budget restraints. \nIKE But I'll get my normal fee, right? \nHe walks away. \nIKE You want me to do it on spec?! \nHe follows him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MARYLAND HIGHWAY - DAY \nWe see Ike driving down the highway.  The car sputters a little as he and Fisher continue their conversation in voice-over. (If needed by the editor.) \nFISHER (V.O.) Don't say \"spec\" like it's a dirty word. Nobody ever paid Shakespeare to write a play!  Plato never got a book advance... \nIKE (V.O.) Oh yeah!  I happen to know from reliable sources that Nietzche got expenses and a rental car. \nWe hear Fisher laugh. \nIKE (V.O.; cont'd) I'm going to make this work, Fish.  I'm going to do it! \nIke's car drives into Hale, passing a billboard reading, \"Welcome to Hale.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HALE STREET - DAY \n", "test2_input": "Maggie hands Ike a third ring.  It's in the shape of a butterfly and studded with multi-color gems. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) George.  He proposed at a butterfly farm in St. Thomas.  The ring was inside a cocoon. \nIKE (grimacing) It's a little \"Silence of the Lambs\" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run. \nMAGGIE He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique. \nNow Maggie shows Ike the ring on her hand.  It's a gold \"#1\" with a diamond set into the number. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) And here we are at Bob.  He proposed during the seventh inning stretch... \nIke touches her hand to examine the ring more closely.  Her surprise at his touch shows on her face as she finishes her sentence. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) ... At an Oriole's game. \nShe takes her hand down.  Ike steps away. \nIKE Wait.  Don't tell me.  The scoreboard lit up with \"Mary me, Maggie.\" \nIke picks up his cup of cappuccino and moves behind the couch. \nMAGGIE It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded. \nIKE (stopping) Highly suspect. \nMAGGIE What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic! \nIKE Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true. \nIke moves back to the couch. \nIKE (cont'd) I think the most anybody can honestly say is, \"Look...\" (sits on the arm of the couch) \"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee that at some point one or both of us will want to get out of this thing.  But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be  mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me\" \nMaggie stares at Ike for a beat.  His words have taken a little bit of her breath away.  She covers. \nMAGGIE I like it. \nShe moves from the fireplace to a chair and sits. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) I'd like it better on a scoreboard. (lightly) Is that how you proposed when you asked your wife to marry you? \nIke is taken aback. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) Don't look so surprised, you've got divorce written all over you. \nIKE I'm a work in progress. \nMAGGIE So?  Is that what you said to her? \nIKE No.  I think I said something eloquent like, \"So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?\" \nMAGGIE Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong? \nIke takes a swallow of cappuccino. \nIKE I don't know. \nMAGGIE You don't know. \nIKE No. \nMAGGIE Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that? \nIke is restless.  He stands up. \nIKE Call me crazy, but I believe that check I gave you entitles me to ask the questions for a while. \nIke puts down his cup of coffee, gets his tape recorder and sits close to Maggie. \nMAGGIE Fair enough. (thinks a beat) Actually... \nMaggie move to TV.  She picks up Ike's stolen post-it notes and her wedding video on top of the TV, and goes to the front door. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) I'll just need one more day to make sure your check clears. \nIKE Ow! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. HALE STREET - THE NEXT DAY \nIke and Maggie drive in Maggie's truck.  They pull up in front of a Bridal Shop. \nA spectacular dress fills the small window.  It's beautiful, romantic, sexy.  Maggie and Ike can be seen in the reflection. \nMAGGIE Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress. \n", "test2_true": "Maggie gives Ike a smile that lights up the sky.  They go inside. \nINT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY \nThe place is fairly large and prosperous, probably the place to go in the Tri-County area.  A little FLOWER GIRL, 10, is being fitted on the pedestal in the middle of the room.  A saleswoman, POLLY, has taken the flower girl under her wing.  They are both under the expert eyes of a stern looking woman, MRS. WHITTENMEYER, the shop owner.  Also, the girl's MOTHER is there watching. \nPOLLY (to the mother) She'll be the prettiest little flower girl in your daughter's wedding. \nMAGGIE Mr. Whittenmeyer.  Hi, Polly! \nThe flower girl sees Maggie and runs and hides behind Polly. \nPOLLY Hi, Maggie.  You'll have to excuse her, Maggie.  Some of the children are afraid of you since you dragged that little boy up the aisle. \nMAGGIE I didn't drag. (then to the girl) He tripped on his shoelaces. \nMrs. Whittenmeyer comes forward to greet Maggie. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER You've come for your dress.  Good! I'll get it from the back. \nMaggie leads her to the front window. \nMAGGIE (happily) Actually, I would like to get this dress. \nShe points to the dress.  She smiles back to Mrs. Whittenmeyer, expecting her to share her joy.  Mrs. Whittenmeyer darkens. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER (to Polly) Polly, take Leslie into change. (then, to Maggie) But the one you have on hold is lovely. \nMAGGIE (pleasantly) Yes.  But I've changed my mind. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER It's one thousand dollars. \nMaggie is keenly aware of Ike listening in. \nMAGGIE I have one thousand dollars. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER (firmly) The other one is only three hundred dollars. \nMaggie lowers her voice, hoping to lessen the humiliation of the moment. \nMAGGIE Is this dress for sale? \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER It just seems like an awful lot of money to spend on one of your dresses, Maggie... You only wear them for about ten minutes. \nIke watches with regret as Maggie's child-like enthusiasm drains away, her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of the shop owner.  He's starting to see that it's no always easy being Maggie. There's a tremor in her voice. \nMAGGIE Yeah, that's a good point. (then, sitting) The other dress is nice. \nIke calls out to Mrs. Whittenmeyer. \nIKE Mrs. Whittenmeyer.  May I talk to you for a second? \nShe walks over to him. \nIKE (cont'd) I don't know much about this kind of thing.  I'm from out of town.  You're a salesperson, right?  You're here to sell wedding dresses. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER (huffy) Yes.  I've been here for thirty years. \nIKE Perfect.  Because Miss Carpenter is here to buy one.  But not just any one. She wants that one. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER It's a thousand dollars! \nIke goes over and takes the mannequin out of the window.  Mrs. Whittenmeyer catches the wig as he puts the mannequin under his arm. \nIKE (cont'd) Look, Aunt Bea, we're buying this beautiful dress and anything else she wants or I'm coming back here with a squirt gun filled with India ink. \nMrs. Whittenmeyer wilts under Ike's fierce gaze.  She turns to Maggie. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER Will he really do that? \nMaggie gives her a look. \nMR. WHITTENMEYER (cont'd) (to Maggie) Well, why don't you pick out some accessories while I get this ready, dear.  Polly, will you come help me, please? \nPolly comes to help carry the mannequin away. \nANGLE ON POLLY AND MRS. WHITTENMEYER: \nPOLLY (whispering to Mrs. Whittenmeyer) It's a thousand dollars. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER Shhhh!  The man has ink! \nMaggie looks gratefully at Ike. \nIKE Tough to spend money in this town. \nTIME CUT: A FEW MINUTES LATER: \n", "test3_input": "ANGLE ON: \nIke as he gets to the window, but Maggie is out in driveway. \nEXT. CHURCH DRIVEWAY - CONTINUING \nMaggie flies toward a FedEx truck at next house just leaving. \nANOTHER ANGLE: \nShe gathers her dress and jumps in as Ike yells from window, then, quickly climbs out onto the lawn as the truck starts to pull away. \nIKE Maggie! \nMaggie looks back once, tearful and regretful, and disappears inside the truck.  The truck races off. \nThe PHOTOGRAPHERS turn their cameras on Ike, en masse.  He is enveloped by a barrage of bright lights. \nEllie and Fisher, who have also stepped outside on chapel front steps, are looking around as Ike turns around the corner and past the church. \nELLIE Look, he's running after her. \nFISHER Look, he's in pretty good shape. \nELLIE Poor Ike. \nThey look after the FedEx truck and watch Ike chasing the truck down the road away from the church. \nIKE (running; yells) Maggie! \nELLIE Where do you think she's going? \nFISHER Wherever it is, she'll be there by ten- thirty tomorrow. \nCindy, Cory, Peggy and Meredith also rush out of the church and comment on Maggie's runaway.  Further down the road, Ike still chases the truck, yelling: \nIKE Maggie! \nAs the truck rounds the bend in the road and disappears, Ike stops and stares alone after the disappearing truck.  A swarm of REPORTERS catch up to him, flashing pictures and asking questions.  Another camera flashes and we cut to: \nA NEWSPAPER PHOTO \nOf Ike's stunned face on the cover of the USA Today.  The caption reads: \"Hit and Run:  Runaway Bride Strikes again\".

I mean, the right way.  Soon as I turn eighteen. \nMAGGIE You're sweet, Dennis.  But you've got to go.  I'm closing up.

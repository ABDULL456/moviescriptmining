{"test1_input": "Ike drives down picturesque Main Street.  He passes Hale Hardware.  Sign says: \"At Curl.  Be back soon.\" \nEXT. ATLANTIC HOTEL - DAY \nA BARBERSHOP QUARTET is singing in front of the only hotel in town.  Ike pulls up and goes inside. \nINT. LOBBY/ATLANTIC HOTEL - DAY \nIke has checked into the Atlantic Hotel.  The clerk, LEE, hands him his key.  Ike asks about room service and the restaurant. An OLDER WOMAN asks him if he plays bridge as he goes up the stairs to his room. \nEXT. HALE MAIN STREET - DAY \nIke exits his hotel as the Barber Shop Quartet finishes singing \"Camptown Races.\" \nHe now walks down the charming main artery of the town, looking exactly like what he is:  a cynical New York out of his element on sunny Main Street, USA.  KIDS ride by on bikes, streaming balloons behind them.  A balloon hits Ike on the face.  As he crosses the street, he mutters into his tape recorder: \nIKE I think I'm in Maryberry. \nFlags hang on all the storefronts and the place sparkles with wholesome attitudes as PEOPLE greet each other familiarly.  Ike comes to beauty parlor called \"Curl Up and Dye\".  The place is doing business and crowded with WOMEN. \nINT. BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY \nCindy, the manicurist, does Mrs. Pressman's nails.  Maggie sits on the floor next to Peggy's salon chair, fixing the base of a barber chair.  She tightens a screw and looks up, satisfied. Cindy's dog is on the floor near Maggie. \nMAGGIE Cindy, you better 86 Sprout.  He seems to be enjoying the petroleum distillates. \nCindy rolls over in her chair, picks up her dog and rolls back to her station. \nCINDY That's it.  Back to obedience school. \nMAGGIE (to Peggy) Okay -- have a seat... gently, carefully. \nPeggy sits in the chair.  Maggie spins her around and around. \nPEGGY (delighted as she spins) You're a goddess! \nMAGGIE I didn't even need to change this gasket, just put in a little hydraulic fluid. \nPEGGY Stop it.  When you talk like that, I get turned on and it frightens me. \nJUST THEN.  Ike enters the salon, taking off his sunglasses. Peggy hops off the chair. \nIKE Hello.  I'm looking for Maggie Carpenter.  There was a sign at the hardware store across the street... \nPEGGY Are you a reporter? \nIt's a little early in the game for Ike to be thrown off guard. \nIKE (shocked) What? \nPEGGY (eyeing his loafers) It's been our experience that anyone with some sort of gewgaw on his loafers ends up being another big city reporter wanting to interview Maggie. \nIKE About her upcoming wedding and all. \nPEGGY No, about her getting that asshole from New York fired. \nIke smiles down at his loafers and shrugs. \nIKE I am just such a reporter.  And you are? \nPEGGY Peggy Phleming.  Not the ice skater. \nPeggy steps aside.  Ike moves toward Cindy and Mrs. Pressman. \nIKE And who are these lovely ladies? \nTe ladies shake his hand and introduce themselves. \nCINDY Cindy.  Maggie's unmarried cousin. \nMRS. PRESSMAN Mrs. Pressman.  No relation. \nPEGGY And you are? \nIKE (turning toward her) Looking for Maggie. \nPEGGY Yep.  Maggie -- Someone to see you. \nMaggie looks over from her sitting position on the floor.  She gives Ike the once-over, focusing on the shoes. \nMAGGIE (yelling to Peggy) Reporter? \nPEGGY Yup! \nIke crouches to see Maggie on the floor just as she rises to her feet.  Ike straightens up.  For a moment, he is thrown by her beauty and intelligent eyes. \nMAGGIE I hope you have a different angle. It's pretty much all been covered. \n", "test1_true": "MAGGIE Excellent. \nPEGGY Hold on -- Nobody interviews Maggie in here unless they're getting haircut. \nMAGGIE She's the boss. \nIKE Sorry, no.  I just got one. \nMRS. PRESSMAN (to Ike) Excuse me, sir.  I have an actual fact for you. \nIKE (steps to Mrs. Pressman) Yes, Mrs. Pressman. \nMRS. PRESSMAN It's her fourth time to the altar, you know.  Not seven like they said. \nIKE I know.  Tell me something.  Do you think she's going to make it all the way this time? \nDuring the Ike/Mrs. Pressman exchange, Maggie looks at Ike. There's something familiar about him.  She looks over at Peggy and beckons her to a copy of Ike's column affixed to a mirror. A goatee and horns, have been scrawled on Ike's byline picture. He's been \"devilized\".  Peggy coughs as she recognizes Ike in the newspaper clipping. \nMAGGIE She swallowed her gun. \nMrs. Pressman continues her story to Ike. \nMRS. PRESSMAN I'm not sure.  Mr. Schullian runs the newsstand, he's our local bookie, you know, he's giving eight to one odds she won't.  He says she's so famous now, maybe Vegas will give odds on her.  I'm going to wait to hear what the pros say. \nIKE Good fact.  Well, you let me know. \nMRS. PRESSMAN Oh, I will. \nANGLE ON: \nMaggie indicates column to Peggy.  She looks over at the part of the shop used to wash and dye hair.  There's a sink, stool and a cabinet affixed to the wall above sink, which holds various shampoos and hair dyes.  Maggie gets an idea.  Maggie and Peggy step forward toward Ike. \nMAGGIE Well, instead of a haircut, how about a wash?  You know, get all that city grit out of it. \nIKE You'll answer my questions? \nMaggie nods affirmatively. \nIKE (cont'd) (removing his jacket) Fine.  You wash, I'll ask the questions. \nPEGGY Great. \nIke hands Peggy his jacket.  A mystified Peggy leads Ike to the sink.  While she does this... \nMAGGIE Have a seat.  Peggy, why don't you give him the special treatment that strengthens the follicles. \nIke sits in the chair near the sink.  Maggie shakes out a smock and puts it around Ike. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) So, what do you want to know? \nIke leans and rests his head on the sink.  Peggy bends over him and wets his hair.  She grabs various hair coloring products. \nIKE Getting nervous? \nMAGGIE Nervous?  Not at all!  No.  I've never been more certain in my life.  Except -- I am having all kinds of weird dreams. \nIke pulls the cloth down from over his face. \nIKE Weird dreams?  You're going to tell me about them? \nMAGGIE Yes. \nPEGGY (calming) Let's just put this back here for the aromatherapy. \nPeggy recovers his face, then continues to fuss with the hair coloring products.  Maggie helps. \nINT. BEAUTY PARLOR - LATER \nIke sits with a towel over his head as Peggy blow-dries the back of his head.  His back is to the mirror, his body faces Maggie. Cindy does her own nails as Mrs. Pressman scratches off lottery tickets.  The dog, Sprout, sits in is basket. \nMAGGIE In another one... \nPETE, wearing a hat, comes in the front door of the salon. \nPEGGY Hey, Pete, I'll be right with you. \nIke peeks out from under his towel as Maggie continues. \nMAGGIE I'm inside the church.  Everyone I know is there, only they're not really them. They're like Frankenstein monsters, but without the bolts coming out of their necks.  It's all very \"Night of the Living Dead\".  And here's the creepiest part -- I look down at my dress and it's red.  I mean, I have no idea what it means.  Red's not my color! \nIke listens intently and stares steadily into her eyes.  Peggy removes the towel.  His hair is divided into equal parts and dyed orange and red. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) So what do you think? \nIke stares back at her, the tickle of suspicion creeping up his spine. \nIKE I think you'd look good in red. \n", "test1_id": 3120, "test2_input": "Maggie hands Ike a third ring.  It's in the shape of a butterfly and studded with multi-color gems. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) George.  He proposed at a butterfly farm in St. Thomas.  The ring was inside a cocoon. \nIKE (grimacing) It's a little \"Silence of the Lambs\" for me.  I can't believe you waited for the wedding to run. \nMAGGIE He's an entomologist!  I thought it was very unique. \nNow Maggie shows Ike the ring on her hand.  It's a gold \"#1\" with a diamond set into the number. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) And here we are at Bob.  He proposed during the seventh inning stretch... \nIke touches her hand to examine the ring more closely.  Her surprise at his touch shows on her face as she finishes her sentence. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) ... At an Oriole's game. \nShe takes her hand down.  Ike steps away. \nIKE Wait.  Don't tell me.  The scoreboard lit up with \"Mary me, Maggie.\" \nIke picks up his cup of cappuccino and moves behind the couch. \nMAGGIE It was one of the most wonderful moments of my life.  Cal Ripken even applauded. \nIKE (stopping) Highly suspect. \nMAGGIE What do you mean?  It was incredibly romantic! \nIKE Maybe it's just me, but -- if you got to dress it up, it doesn't ring true. \nIke moves back to the couch. \nIKE (cont'd) I think the most anybody can honestly say is, \"Look...\" (sits on the arm of the couch) \"I guarantee that we'll have tough times.  I guarantee that at some point one or both of us will want to get out of this thing.  But I also guarantee that if I don't ask you to be  mine, I'll regret it for the rest of my life. Because I know in my heart -- you're the only one for me\" \nMaggie stares at Ike for a beat.  His words have taken a little bit of her breath away.  She covers. \nMAGGIE I like it. \nShe moves from the fireplace to a chair and sits. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) I'd like it better on a scoreboard. (lightly) Is that how you proposed when you asked your wife to marry you? \nIke is taken aback. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) Don't look so surprised, you've got divorce written all over you. \nIKE I'm a work in progress. \nMAGGIE So?  Is that what you said to her? \nIKE No.  I think I said something eloquent like, \"So, uh -- maybe we should, ya know.  What do you think?\" \nMAGGIE Now that's romantic.  A proposal like that and you didn't find eternal bliss? What went wrong? \nIke takes a swallow of cappuccino. \nIKE I don't know. \nMAGGIE You don't know. \nIKE No. \nMAGGIE Maybe you should ask her some time. Ever thought of that? \nIke is restless.  He stands up. \nIKE Call me crazy, but I believe that check I gave you entitles me to ask the questions for a while. \nIke puts down his cup of coffee, gets his tape recorder and sits close to Maggie. \nMAGGIE Fair enough. (thinks a beat) Actually... \nMaggie move to TV.  She picks up Ike's stolen post-it notes and her wedding video on top of the TV, and goes to the front door. \nMAGGIE (cont'd) I'll just need one more day to make sure your check clears. \nIKE Ow! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. HALE STREET - THE NEXT DAY \nIke and Maggie drive in Maggie's truck.  They pull up in front of a Bridal Shop. \nA spectacular dress fills the small window.  It's beautiful, romantic, sexy.  Maggie and Ike can be seen in the reflection. \nMAGGIE Even with everything that's happened I've still never been married and I still deserve a beautiful dress. \n", "test2_true": "Maggie gives Ike a smile that lights up the sky.  They go inside. \nINT. BRIDAL SHOP - DAY \nThe place is fairly large and prosperous, probably the place to go in the Tri-County area.  A little FLOWER GIRL, 10, is being fitted on the pedestal in the middle of the room.  A saleswoman, POLLY, has taken the flower girl under her wing.  They are both under the expert eyes of a stern looking woman, MRS. WHITTENMEYER, the shop owner.  Also, the girl's MOTHER is there watching. \nPOLLY (to the mother) She'll be the prettiest little flower girl in your daughter's wedding. \nMAGGIE Mr. Whittenmeyer.  Hi, Polly! \nThe flower girl sees Maggie and runs and hides behind Polly. \nPOLLY Hi, Maggie.  You'll have to excuse her, Maggie.  Some of the children are afraid of you since you dragged that little boy up the aisle. \nMAGGIE I didn't drag. (then to the girl) He tripped on his shoelaces. \nMrs. Whittenmeyer comes forward to greet Maggie. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER You've come for your dress.  Good! I'll get it from the back. \nMaggie leads her to the front window. \nMAGGIE (happily) Actually, I would like to get this dress. \nShe points to the dress.  She smiles back to Mrs. Whittenmeyer, expecting her to share her joy.  Mrs. Whittenmeyer darkens. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER (to Polly) Polly, take Leslie into change. (then, to Maggie) But the one you have on hold is lovely. \nMAGGIE (pleasantly) Yes.  But I've changed my mind. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER It's one thousand dollars. \nMaggie is keenly aware of Ike listening in. \nMAGGIE I have one thousand dollars. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER (firmly) The other one is only three hundred dollars. \nMaggie lowers her voice, hoping to lessen the humiliation of the moment. \nMAGGIE Is this dress for sale? \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER It just seems like an awful lot of money to spend on one of your dresses, Maggie... You only wear them for about ten minutes. \nIke watches with regret as Maggie's child-like enthusiasm drains away, her happy mood crushed by the tactless assault of the shop owner.  He's starting to see that it's no always easy being Maggie. There's a tremor in her voice. \nMAGGIE Yeah, that's a good point. (then, sitting) The other dress is nice. \nIke calls out to Mrs. Whittenmeyer. \nIKE Mrs. Whittenmeyer.  May I talk to you for a second? \nShe walks over to him. \nIKE (cont'd) I don't know much about this kind of thing.  I'm from out of town.  You're a salesperson, right?  You're here to sell wedding dresses. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER (huffy) Yes.  I've been here for thirty years. \nIKE Perfect.  Because Miss Carpenter is here to buy one.  But not just any one. She wants that one. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER It's a thousand dollars! \nIke goes over and takes the mannequin out of the window.  Mrs. Whittenmeyer catches the wig as he puts the mannequin under his arm. \nIKE (cont'd) Look, Aunt Bea, we're buying this beautiful dress and anything else she wants or I'm coming back here with a squirt gun filled with India ink. \nMrs. Whittenmeyer wilts under Ike's fierce gaze.  She turns to Maggie. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER Will he really do that? \nMaggie gives her a look. \nMR. WHITTENMEYER (cont'd) (to Maggie) Well, why don't you pick out some accessories while I get this ready, dear.  Polly, will you come help me, please? \nPolly comes to help carry the mannequin away. \nANGLE ON POLLY AND MRS. WHITTENMEYER: \nPOLLY (whispering to Mrs. Whittenmeyer) It's a thousand dollars. \nMRS. WHITTENMEYER Shhhh!  The man has ink! \nMaggie looks gratefully at Ike. \nIKE Tough to spend money in this town. \nTIME CUT: A FEW MINUTES LATER: \n", "test2_id": 3121, "test3_input": "PEGGY His hair... any color. \nGRANDMA JULIA I like his tight butt. \nPeggy laughs. \nMAGGIE Grandma! \nPEGGY (to Cindy) See, this is a mature relationship. She's really found it. \nCUT TO: \nLOVE MONTAGE SHOTS: \nEXT. OCEAN - DAY \nIke and Maggie fishing. \nINT. MAGGIE'S WORKSHOP/HOME - DAY \nThey play ping-pong.  They laugh, enjoying the moment. \nINT. MAGGIE'S HOUSE - DAY \nIke and Maggie have fun playing cards.  The game is slapjack. \nEXT. FIELD - DAY \nMaggie and Ike horseback riding.  They sit on their horses amongst trees, \"nuzzling\".  Ike reads as he pushes Maggie in a tire swing. \nINT. MAGGIE'S ROOM - DAY \nIke and Maggie open and close a Hoberman ball by holding its opposite ends in their teeth.  Grandma looks in. \nINT. MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nThere is a fire in the fireplace.  Maggie and Ike sit as Ike shows Maggie some passages from his favorite books.  He's reading something from Yeats at the moment.  They seem happy. \nEXT. CHURCH - THE DAY OF THE WEDDING \nIt is a media circus including FOUR REPORTERS, Midday with Meredith and the T-shirt Vendor.  Plus three other people the reporters are interviewing, a GERMAN LADY, BUTCH KENAN, a farmer and Grandma Julia.  Reporter DINA NAPOLI walks down the church steps. \nDINA NAPOLI (OF WBAL) Wedding bells are ringing for the fourth time today in Hale, Maryland. Maggie Carpenter, \"Always a Bride -- Never a Bridesmaid\", will be attempting to complete her fourth wedding ceremony. We'll come back on the air when the results are in.  Back to you, Jessica. \nMeredith, the low-end public access TV reporter, films himself pointing a cheap video camera himself. \nMEREDITH The turnout for this morning's wedding is usually reserved for royalty or Hollywood stars, but Maggie Carpenter is Hale, Maryland's special star and the citizens of Hale are out in full force today. \nThe NY T-shirt Vendor pitches his wares. \nT-SHIRT VENDOR I got \"Bye-bye Birdie\".  \"What part of 'I do' don't you understand?\"... Get your \"Runaway Bride\" T-shirts here... \nReporter JULIE MURPHY stands near Grandma Julia and Mrs. Pressman. \nJULIE MURPHY (Channel 6) The bride's been here for almost an hour, but being around in the beginning was never her problem.  We'll be here, showing you the full wedding ceremony, we hope. \nReporter JACKI and TIFFANY stand at the edge of the CROWD reporting. \nJACKI/REPORTER #3 (WBOC TV16) Will she or won't she?  That is on the minds of these several hundreds folks, who are standing here this morning. Not to mention on the mind of Groom Number #4, ex-USA Today columnist, Ike Graham, who is missing in action. \nEXT. WINDOW OF CHURCH/INT. SUNDAY SCHOOL ROOM - DAY \nINSERT window of church.  Peggy peers out the window at the carnival scene.  Cindy sits with Maggie as she leans forward, doubled over on a child's chair.  Peggy moves from the window to sit with them. \nMAGGIE (moves to window) He's not coming.  Watch.  He's not coming. \nPEGGY No, no.  I saw eight geese flying in a \"V\". \nMAGGIE You and your lucky geese.  You always see geese. \nPEGGY Not eight... \nCINDY And in a \"V\". \nMAGGIE Eight is good... \"V\" could be Victory. \nThey ad lib various words starting with the letter \"V\".  Maggie is nervous. \nCINDY Rub your ears. \nPEGGY Yes, rubbing your ears is very soothing. Cory does that to me when I hyperventilate. \nMaggie rubs her ears. \nCINDY We do it to our dog. \nMAGGIE It's hurting. \n", "test3_true": "After they rub Maggie's ears a bit: \nPEGGY He's here!  He's here! \nThey all squeeze and peer out window.  They scream in excitement. Cindy rushes to Maggie's wedding dress. \nCINDY I'll get the dress. \nMAGGIE He's here!... He's here! \nPEGGY Now's the time for calm... If you don't calm down, you won't get your dress on... (reassuringly) He's the one... He's the one. \nPeggy moves to help Cindy with the dress.  Maggie stands alone at the window a moment.  She picks up a toy horse. \nMAGGIE This is not a good sign. \nMaggie goes over to Peggy and Cindy, and starts to get into her bridal gown.  They continue to ad lib words standing with the letter \"V\". \nCINDY We have to hurry.  The Sunday School kids will be here soon. \nCUT TO: \nINT. IKE'S CAR - DAY \nIke pulls up slowly.  GUESTS peer through the his car window and wave.  Ike rubs his headache. \nJULIE MURPHY Well, the groom just pulled up.  There was talk of a \"now show\", but he is here. \nDINA NAPOLI Ike Graham is here! \nIKE'SPOV: \nHe moves as he takes it all in:  a FAMILY eats a fast food picnic on a neighbor's lawn, invited GUESTS flock by in their party best, and local NEWS TEAMS block the way.  The STATE SENATOR is making a speech welcoming the press to Maryland.  A large GROUP of reporters head up the church's stairs, hauling their equipment.  They enter the flood of PEOPLE streaming inside the church.  Ike snaps. \nEXT. IKE'S CAR - CONTINUING \nIke stops the car where it is and jumps out, slamming the door in anger.  The REPORTERS swarm around him as he gets out of the car. They continue to pound him with questions as he walks to church steps.  An OLDER LADY smacks him on the shoulder with a newspaper.  He turns in astonishment and continues up the steps.  He charges up the stairs and grabs Lee. \nIKE Shoot ours so she has one with an ending. \nMrs. Pressman stands, shooting Ike with her video camera. \nIKE (cont'd) (pleading) Mrs. Pressman, please. \nMRS. PRESSMAN It's okay.  There's no microphone. You're no fun. \nIKE No, I'm not. \nIke retreats into the church.  Lee comes up to him again with his video camera:  CHUFFA about Scorsese. \nINT. CHURCH - CONTINUING \nAs Fisher and Ellie sign the guest book, a LOCAL LADY stares at Ellie.  Ellie stares back at her until she leaves.  Ike walks away from Lee and turns smack into Ellie and Fisher.  Ike puts his arms around them and gives them a big hug. \nIKE Friends.  Thank you.  Thank you. \nOver Ellie's shoulder, Ike sees Fisher's grinning face. \nIKE (cont'd) We are friends, aren't we, Fisher? \nFISHER (grinning) Of course we are.  Of course. \nIKE Then you'll be my best man. \nFISHER Well, I'm good, I don't know if I'm best. \nIKE Go talk to the pastor and he'll tell you what to do.  And someone will tell me what to do. \nELLIE You always looked great in that suit... And Ike? (emotional) I'm happy for you, honey. \nEllie whispers in his ear. \nELLIE (cont'd) I'll have a car around the back to whisk you out of here if she runs. \nEllie kisses him on the cheek and walks away. \nANGLE ON: \nBob comes up to Ike.  He looks like he's going to punch Ike, then abruptly holds out a rose boutonniere. \nBOB You look awful. \nIKE (sarcastically) Thank you. \nBob hands the flower to Ike.  Ike is shaking.  Bob catches this and looks up to Ike.  It is a moment of clean honesty between the men. \nBOB Ike.  Need help? \n", "test3_id": 3122}

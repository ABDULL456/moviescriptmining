STEVE Jeez. And you think the British'll share it with their Allies? 
DAVID Major Richards said he'd call to let us know. 
STEVE That's big of him. 
He looks from David to Emmi as if trying to work out something.  Then: 
STEVE Okay, better question the next witness. I bet you a bottle of French champagne he tells us the baton story inside ten minutes. 
DAVID Five minutes. 
STEVE It's a bet. You're the witness, Emmi. 
Later. 
Rode in the witness chair. Steve studying the file. David and Emmi ready to take notes. 
STEVE Helmuth Alfred Rode. Second violinist since 1935. What's it mean, second violinist? 
RODE It means I wasn't good enough to be a first violinist. 
He chuckles, looks around for approval. Steve grins encouragingly. 
STEVE Good, and according to your questionnaire, Helmuth, you never joined the Nazi Party. 
RODE Me? Never.  Never. 
Long silence. 
RODE I... I know everyone now says they were never Nazis but in my case it is absolutely one hundred per cent true. I am a Catholic, it would have been totally against my conscience. 
Silence. 
Steve lights a cigarette; Rode eyes it hungrily. 
RODE Is it true you're going to interview Dr. Furtw√§ngler today? 
STEVE I'll ask the questions, Helmuth. 
RODE Excuse me. Did you know that he refused to give the Nazi salute when Hitler was present in the audience? 
Steve flicks David a glance, waggles his finger like a baton.

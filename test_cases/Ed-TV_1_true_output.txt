BARRY So if it's a show and they have a guy die that's writing, but if it's real and they have a guy die that's murder. 
94    EXT. VIDEO STORE - DAY Ed arrives for work. 
People CALL OUT to him-- PEDESTRIANS, PEOPLE FROM CARS, TRUCK DRIVERS. "Hey Ed, my man." Ed waves. People shake his hand. A teenage boy looks into the camera, making a funny face. Someone else looks into the camera and says, "Hi, Ma." 
Suddenly, Ray is there with a WOMAN. Ray is not happy. He's wearing DARK GLASSES and a HAT. 
RAY Hi. 
Ed stops. 
ED ... Ray? 
RAY Yeah. 
ED Oh, man, I've been trying to call you. 
RAY I know. 
ED Look, we gotta talk. 
RAY Save it. 
A GUY in a car appears and points at Ray. 
GUY Hey, you're that French guy on TV. 
RAY French guy? 
GUY Monsieur Bad-a-lay. 
The guy drives away. Ray is steaming. 
RAY Let me just do what I came here to do. 
Ed thinks he means to fight. Ed tries to calm him. 
ED What are we gonna fight? Ray, please, listen to me -- 
RAY (beckoning) Cassie... 
CASSIE, a woman about Ray's age, steps forward. She's slightly self-conscious. 
RAY (CONT'D) Go ahead. 
Ray points Cassie to the camera. 
CASSIE This is really hard. 
RAY You promised me. 
CASSIE (to the camera) I went out with Ray a few years ago for... a couple of months. And we... were intimate. And. he's really not as bad as that girl said he was. 
Ray nods. 
CASSIE (CONT'D) I mean, I've definitely had worse. 
RAY That's enough. 
Ed is amazed that Ray would do this. 
RAY (CONT'D) (to Ed) Good-bye, brother! 
ED Ray, come an-- 
Ray leaves, still angry. 
Cassie lingers. 
CASSIE (flirting slightly) So you're Ed. 
Ray returns and yanks Cassie away with him. Ed still hasn't recovered from the bizarreness he just witnessed. Two girls YELL in unison from across the street. 
GIRLS Ed... we love you!

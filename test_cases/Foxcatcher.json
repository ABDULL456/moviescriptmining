{"train": "FOXCATCHER \nWritten by \nE. Max Frye & Dan Futterman \nINT. UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN GYM - VERY EARLY MORNING \nMARK SCHULTZ (27, 180 lbs., cauliflower ears) lifts a human- sized, leather WRESTLING DUMMY from the mat to stand in front of him. He performs a series of repetitive moves - hooking one arm under the dummy's arm, then the other; one side, then other. Again and again. It looks almost as if he's dancing gently with it. \nThen, very fast, Mark spins quickly around behind the dummy, grabs it in a bear hug, arches his back, lifts and SLAMS it to the mat, landing on top. \nQUICK CUTS: Mark spinning, lifting and slamming the dummy - first one way, then the other - first one hold, then another - SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM. SLAM - over and over and over again. \nCUT TO: \nI/E. BARABOO SCHOOL/PARKING LOT - LATE MORNING \nMark pulls his beat-up car into a space in the parking lot of this nondescript, 1960s-era suburban brick-facade school. He's freshly showered, wears a short-sleeve dress shirt, clip- on tie, slacks. He reaches behind the front seat and pulls out a battered BROWN VINYL BRIEFCASE. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY \nMark waits alone in a chair he's much too big for, his brown vinyl briefcase on his lap. A portrait of President Reagan hangs on the painted cinder block wall. A clock ticks. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BARABOO SCHOOL/AUDITORIUM - DAY \nMark's on stage. An audience of 4th, 5th and 6th graders. \nMARK Why do I do it? Why do I push myself to my limits - of pain, of exhaustion - every day of my life? Why do I wake up every morning and make the commitment? Why do I do it? \nThe students are open-mouthed - they have no idea what to make of him. Mark's not being willfully over-the-top with these kids. This is just what's on his mind. All the time. \nMARK (CONT'D) In 13 months - if I train right, if I push myself - I'll be going to Seoul - that's a city in South Korea. Does anyone know why? Because that's where the Olympic games are. \nMark reaches into the briefcase at his feet and pulls out a RIBBON with a MEDAL dangling from it. \nMARK (CONT'D) Does anyone know what this is? \nAs a couple of kids start to raise their hands -- \nMARK (CONT'D) Olympic gold medal. I won it three years ago at the `84 Games in Los Angeles. My brother, Dave Schultz - my best friend, my older brother, my best friend - won one too, just 23 hours and 16 minutes before I did. That's unprecedented - two brothers winning at the same Olympics. (THEN) Would you like me to win another one? Would you like me to win another gold medal - for us, for America? Would you like to see me and my big brother - Dave Schultz - both win gold medals? Who here wants to see the two brothers win again? \nSilence. A couple of the kids tentatively raise their hands. The rest are completely frozen. \nMARK (CONT'D) Well we're going to give it absolutely everything we've got. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BARABOO SCHOOL/PRINCIPAL'S OFFICE WAITING ROOM - DAY \nA SCHOOL SECRETARY writes out a check as Mark stands in front of the desk, placing his medal back in his briefcase. \nSCHOOL SECRETARY Twenty... and... no one-hundreds... \nShe tears off the check and hands it to Mark. He takes the check, holds out to her a SIGNED 8x10 PHOTO of himself with his arms raised, in a USA WRESTLING SINGLET just after winning his Olympic gold. \nMARK And this is for the trophy case. \nSCHOOL SECRETARY I'm sorry?... For what? \nMARK For the trophy case. (BEAT) With the trophies. \nSCHOOL SECRETARY It's an elementary school. \nAs Mark holds out the photo, WE HEAR: \nFAST FOOD KID (V.O.) Can I take your order? \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARBY'S - DAY \nA long-haired, greasy KID with the very beginnings of a mustache takes Mark's order. Mark looks up at the menu sign. \nMARK I'll have a # 4. \nMark, the phone tucked against his shoulder, slips a BLANK TAPE into a cheap VCR. He slides a HAND-LABELED TAPE into a second VCR, wired to the first. We can read the label: \"THE MARK SCHULTZ WRESTLING CLINIC.\" He starts making a copy. \nMARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) I'm arranging a clinic in your area next weekend, and I wanted to invite you and some of your wrestlers to join... \nJUMP CUT TO: \nMARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) That's Dave, my brother. I wrestle at 180... No, he won't be there, just me... Okay - well, good luck with your season, coach. \nJUMP TO: \nOn the screen is a montage of highlights from Mark's career: take downs, pins. He's an animal - powerful, aggressive. \nMARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Yes, there's a small fee. \nJUMP TO: \nMARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) S-C-H-U-L-T-Z.... \nJUMP TO: \nOn the screen, Mark wrestles Resit Karabajak, a Turkish wrestler, in his first round match at the `84 Olympics. \nMARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) A unique, character-building opportunity for young wrestlers.... Yes, a small fee... \nMark throws Karabajak to the mat. Pins him. Walks away, arms raised. Crowd cheers. Karabajak's on the mat, hurt. \nMARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Dave's my brother... \nOn screen, Mark does a back flip. \nJUMP TO: \nMARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Olympic Champion... \nMark does a back flip. \nMARK (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Dave's my brother... \nJUMP TO: \nMark's holds the phone on his lap, just watching himself on the screen, wrestling... winning... match after match... \nEXT. MARK'S APARTMENT/OUTSIDE WALKWAY - EVENING \nMark's outside at the second floor railing of this two-story stucco building, looking out over the bleak landscape: a 7- 11, an Auto-Zone. He eats a hard-boiled egg. He watches a CAR pull into the lot below. Dave gets out, looks up. \nDAVE Where were you today? \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nDave fills two mismatched glasses with tap water from the faucet. \nDAVE How far'd you run? Ten? \nMark's on the tattered couch. He shrugs, though we should see that he loves the fact that Dave is concerned about him. \nDAVE (CONT'D) More than ten? Dragging weight the whole way? (Dave turns off the water) You're a sick fuck, you know that? \nDave turns to look at Mark, sitting in the bare living room. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Place is looking good, by the way. I like what you've done with it. \nDave notices the Public Schools Directory on the table. \nDAVE (CONT'D) You setting up clinics? \nMARK Talked to some coaches. \nDave comes toward Mark, handing off a water glass, dragging the folding chair over to sit across from him. \nDAVE I hope you don't have anything booked for Saturday. \nMARK Why? \nDAVE I need a favor. This school called me months ago to do a gig but now I can't. Nancy's got a thing all day so I gotta watch the kids. You free? \nMARK I'll check. \nINT. DAVE'S CAR/OUTSIDE MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nMark looks out the window. Silence. They sit there, both bruised and bloodied. \nMARK Sorry about your nose. \nDAVE No, you're not. (BEAT) Come by the house, have dinner with me and Nance and the kids. \nMark's still looking out the window. He speaks quietly - \nMARK You win a gold medal for them. And still. Nothing. No respect. \nHe reaches for the door handle. \nDAVE Hey. Gimme a hug. \nDave reaches for his arm, and Mark folds automatically into his older brother, puts his head on his chest. Dave embraces him for several long moments - it's like a father and his young child. Then Dave smacks him on the back of the neck. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Same time tomorrow. \nMark nods, gets out of the car and walks away. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT - EVENING \nMark presses PLAY on his answering machine. Hang-ups and DIAL TONES. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT/BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nMark examines his bruised face in the mirror, wiping away blood - some of it his, some his brother's. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARK'S APARTMENT - LATER \nMark's at the refrigerator, cracking ice cube trays into a plastic 7-11 shopping bag. The PHONE RINGS. He picks up -- \nMARK (ON PHONE) Yah. \nA man's voice is heard. It sounds like long distance. \nMAN (OVER PHONE) May I please speak with Mr. Mark Schultz? \nMARK (ON PHONE) It's Mark. \nMAN (OVER PHONE) I'm sorry to call you at night, but Mr. du Pont was anxious that I get in touch with you. \nMARK (ON PHONE) Okay... \nMAN (ON PHONE) He asked that you please consider taking a day off from your training to come out to Foxcatcher Farms so you men can meet face to face. \nMARK (ON PHONE) Who do you work for again? \nMAN (ON PHONE) John E. du Pont of the du Pont family of Newtown Square, Pennsylvania. (BEAT) You may also know of him in connection with his support of the Villanova wrestling program. \nMARK (ON PHONE) (HE DOESN'T) What does he want to talk about? \nMAN (ON PHONE) Mr. du Pont requested that I contact you to set up a meeting. He'd like to bring you out to Pennsylvania. \nMARK (ON PHONE) Uh-huh. \nMAN (ON PHONE) If I may I'd like to make travel arrangements for you, Mr. Schultz. \nMark's holding the ice cube tray, alone in his dingy kitchen. \nMAN (ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Mr. Schultz? \nCUT TO: \nINT. PHL AIRPORT/ARRIVAL GATE - DAY \nBRANDON (20s, post-prep school, jacket/tie) waits for Mark. \nBRANDON Mr. Schultz, I'm Brandon. Welcome to Philadelphia. \nCUT TO: \nMARK Oh. Well. I take the mornings on my own - as you said, strength training, endurance - then I meet up with my brother - you know Dave Schultz - ? \nDU PONT Of course, of course, yes, I know him. I mean, not personally, but yes, of course, I do know him. \nMARK - I meet up with him at the U-W gym, we work out whatever free time we can grab between team practice. \nDU PONT University of Wisconsin. \nMARK Yes sir. \nDU PONT Where you both coach. \nMark NODS vaguely. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) And they provide you with everything you need? \nBeat. \nMARK Pretty much. \nA moment as du Pont watches Mark. \nDU PONT I'd like to see you win this upcoming tournament - \nMARK - Thank you - \nDU PONT - I'd like to help you win this upcoming tournament. It's a big one, yes? \nMARK It's the world championship. \nDu Pont nods. \nDU PONT Why do you do it, Mark? \nMark just looks at him, unsure what he's being asked. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) Why? \nMARK (simply no other reason) I want to be the best in the world. \nDU PONT I want you to be the best in the world. I want this country to be the best in the world. (THEN) May I speak frankly? \nMark nods... of course. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) I'm concerned. I'm concerned by what I see in these Unites States. Athletes labor to bring honor to America, and America fails to honor that labor. Fails to honor it and fails to support it. \nMark's staring at du Pont intently. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) When did you win your first match? \nMARK I started kind of late - high school sophomore. \nDu Pont waits, listening... \nMARK (CONT'D) I was... well, truthfully, I was... kind of lost. And I got into it `cause my brother was wrestling. He convinced me to give it a try. I never told him this, but I was scared of losing in front of him. So of course my first match I get put up against a kid two years older. Dave was helping coach from my corner... and at the end, when the ref raised my hand... (MORE) \nMARK (CONT'D) there was my brother, he was running towards me - screaming - laughing - he lifted me up -- \nMark stops - face flushed - tries to stop himself from getting CHOKED UP. After a few moments, he speaks quietly: \nMARK (CONT'D) It's always been his sport. He let me inside. I'm just lucky to be very very good at it. \nDU PONT You won that match. Not him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY \nDu Pont and Mark walk the last few steps of a huge lawn up to an OLD FIELD HOUSE in the final stages of renovation. Du Pont opens the door. They walk into a gleaming new GYM. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS \nFour pristine WRESTLING MATS are spread out on the floor. Through a doorway on the far end we can glimpse a WEIGHT ROOM with new nautilus and stationary bikes and free weights. \nDU PONT The U.S. Olympic Committee refuses to recognize that training for international competition is a full time job. Why is that? Why is that? (looks at Mark) I want you all to have a home. \nCUT TO: \nOn the two men standing in the porch light. PRELAP the sound of POUNDING FEET, getting louder and louder - \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOXCATCHER GYM - SEVERAL WEEKS LATER/DAY \nCLOSE ON: Wrestling shoes running FAST in place on the gym mat. There are SIX SETS of feet in a wide circle. Team Foxcatcher is beginning to come together. \nMARK Drop! \nAll six wrestlers, Mark included, drop to the mats for 10 fast push-ups and sit-ups. \nThe wrestlers are: ROBERTO GARCIA, aka \"GECKO\" (21 years old, 105 pounds, Latino, as fast a talker as he is a wrestler); JIM ZEREGA - \"JIMMY Z\" (24, 114 lbs., blond Midwesterner); MATT POPPER (24, 149 lbs., East coast working class); BRUCE SPRINGER (27, also 149 lbs., half Asian); MARK SCHULTZ (180 lbs.); and DAN BANE (30, 198 lbs., strong and low-key, intelligent, from the West, like Mark.) \nThe wrestlers jump up - run in place incredibly fast. \nMARK (CONT'D) DROP - \nJUMP CUT TO: \nGarcia and Zerega sprint to the end of the mats and back. Relay shuttles, each pair races, then the next pair. \nPopper and Springer have just run (probably for the twentieth time) - they're BENT OVER, sucking wind by the wall. \nDu Pont WALKS IN. He wears a sweatsuit, has a whistle around his neck. He hovers a slight distance away, observing, seeming to want to be noticed. \nMark and Dan take off, racing, as Garcia beats Zerega - \nDu Pont stares at Garcia. As Dan and Mark race back, Dan notices du Pont - \nDAN Hey, Coach. \nDu Pont becomes at once an odd combination of a kid invited to join in and the actual boss and benefactor of this team. \nDU PONT Dan Bane. How's that hamstring? \nDAN Coming back. It's coming back. \nDU PONT Good. Good to hear. Hamstring coming back. \nMARK (walking up to him) Sir, you need me for something? \nDU PONT No no. Later. Please. Continue. \nMARK (nods, turns back) Pair up. On the mat. Up and down. Popper, Springer, let's go. \nSpringer's dragging a bit, clearly wiped out. \nGARCIA Spling Loll - must lay off the pohk flied lice. \nSPRINGER (EXHAUSTED) Suck me, Gecko. (as he comes onto the mat) And I'm fucking Filipino, dickhead. \nThe six wrestlers are paired and spread out on the mats - each pair in the up-down position. \nMARK Go! \nThey all go to it - the top wrestler trying to get a hold secure enough to turn the other - and the down wrestler splayed on the mat, fending him off. \nDu Pont hovers nearby, watching intently. We can sense his fascination - his admiration for these athletes. Also, his jealousy - how desperately he'd love to be part of this brotherhood.... He CLAPS, like a coach would.... \nDU PONT (awkward, not loud enough) Good. (CLAPS AGAIN) Good. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - LATE AFTERNOON \nMark, freshly showered, walks across the yard from the field house gym to the Big House. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nDu Pont's pouring himself a scotch and soda at the built-in wall bar. Mark's in the SITTING AREA of this large office, which gives the unmistakable impression of having been inspired by the Oval Office. (We should sense that this is not the first of these meetings.) \nDU PONT I can't get you anything at all? \nMARK No, thank you. I'm good. \nDU PONT In training. Excellent. \nINT. WRESTLING ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - LATER/DAY \nMark wrestles like an animal - aggressive, forceful and fast. Dave's in Mark's corner, coaching - focused, intense, and very tough on Mark - shouting instruction. \nOn du Pont, watching from the stands... \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - EVENING \nLoud. The TV is on. A few Team USA WRESTLERS watch the French Sports TV wrap-up of the day's matches. Danielle JUMPS on the bed near the window, with Nancy watching her. \nDANIELLE One... twois... quatro! \nNancy laughs. Dave wrestles with Alexander on the other bed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DAVE'S ROOM - SAME TIME \nDu Pont and Mark are outside the door. Mark holds a VIDEOTAPE. He KNOCKS. No answer. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME \nDave wrestling with Alex on the bed. \nDAVE ...Fireman's carry... to a half- nelson... to a chicken wing... Wait! A chicken wing? \nHe starts to gobble up Alex's arm, who SHRIEKS in delight. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY OUTSIDE DAVE'S ROOM - SAME TIME \nMark knocks again. We HEAR Nancy's voice yell from inside: \"It's open!\" Mark opens the door. \nINT. DAVE'S HOTEL ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nNoisy, chaotic. The wrestlers glance over \"Hey, Mark\" \"What's up\".... Mark's focused on Dave, who wrestles with Alex - \nMARK Dave. \nDAVE - a scrambled-egg!... a feather- pluck!... \nDave's plucking Alex and Alex is cracking up. \nMARK Dave. \nDAVE Hey, Mark -- \nMARK Come meet Mr. du Pont. \nDave sweeps up Alex and throws him over his shoulder, carrying him to the door. He SHAKES du Pont's HAND. \nDAVE Hi. Dave Schultz. \nDU PONT John du Pont. It's a pleasure to meet you in person finally. \nMARK (TO DAVE) I told him how excited you were to meet him. \nDAVE This is Alex, that's my wife, Nancy, our daughter Danielle. (TO NANCY) Hey, Nance. John du Pont. \nNancy waves from over near the window - \nNANCY Hey. \nDU PONT Hello. \nDAVE Come on in. Can I get you a drink - \nDU PONT No no. \nDAVE You sure - ? \nDU PONT Thank you. No. I need to be getting back. But, don't worry - we'll make a Foxcatcher out of you yet. (he laughs awkwardly) Until tomorrow. \nAnd he's GONE. Beat. Dave shrugs. \nDU PONT I think you're up. \nSilence. Du Pont goes over to him, unsure what to do. Uncomfortable, he puts his hand on Mark's shoulder. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) Mark. Dave just won. It's your turn. \nMark's body starts to shake. Then, very quietly: \nMARK I don't want to let you down. \nThis is the first time anyone has said anything like this to du Pont. He has no idea how to respond. He woodenly pats Mark's shoulder, then takes his hand back. \nDU PONT I can't.... I've watched you these past months... (long beat, then quietly) I can't imagine being let down by you. \nMark stops shaking. Du Pont stands patiently beside him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ARENA/CLERMONT-FERRAND - MOMENTS LATER \nCAMERA'S TIGHT ON Mark as he enters the arena. Mark walks directly onto the mat, straight to the center, faces off with the Bulgarian, NANEV. CAMERA stays tight on Mark looking directly at Nanev, as the ref checks each of them. \nWHISTLE. The match begins. Intense and rough. Neither able to gain an edge. Dave coaches from Mark's corner. \nCUT TO: \nIn between periods. Mark sits as Dave FANS him with a towel, shouting instruction. Mark glances behind him: du Pont watches from the stands. \nCUT TO: \nMark and Nanev wrestle the final seconds - Mark ahead by a point. Nanev tries desperately to turn Mark, to gain any advantage. The whistle blows. \nThe ref takes each of their hands. He RAISES Mark's. He turns them around, raises Mark's hand again. \nMark does a BACK FLIP. He trots over to the opposing coach, shakes his hand. He trots to his corner where Dave - beaming, his arms open wide - embraces him. Mark hugs his brother quickly, then turns to LOOK OUT into the stands. \nHe SPOTS du Pont, who's coming down the steps toward the platform. Mark walks toward him. The enormity of what he's just accomplished STARTS TO HIT Mark. His face is red. He reaches du Pont, and from a step below him, THROWS HIS ARMS around him, clings to him. Mark starts to SOB. \nDu Pont holds him as he looks out toward the wrestling mat, where Dave watches. \nPRELAP SOUND: The beginning \"AAAAAH's\" of David Bowie's \"LET'S DANCE\". \nCUT TO: \nINT. TROPHY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - NIGHT \n\"LET'S DANCE\" blasts from the stereo. Team Foxcatcher wrestlers are huddled in a circle in the Trophy Room - shouting the \"AAAAAAAH's\" along with the thin white duke. Each holds a BOTTLE OF CHAMPAGNE, shaking it up as they sing. \nWhen the chords kick in, they POP THEIR CORKS - SPRAYING champagne on each other, shouting wildly. Then they all CHUG the rest of their bottles. Du Pont is dancing around outside the circle, doing his best Euro-electronica moves, and drinking from his bottle (and it's not his first). The wrestlers DANCE. When du Pont finishes his bottle - \nDU PONT Let's clear it out! \nHe gestures toward the center section of the enormous TROPHY CASE - the entirety of which is filled with horse-jumping and fox-hunting medals, ribbons and plaques. \nSome of the wrestlers open the glass doors and start taking down what's in there. A few of the others open more liquor... \nDU PONT (CONT'D) Oh, yes! \nSPRINGER You sure about this? \nDU PONT Mother's idea of sport is riding a horse that's chasing a dog that's chasing a fox. I don't share her affection for horseflesh - \nThe center case is cleared out. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) Put `em up, boys! \nThey hang their wrestling medals, place in trophies and other awards - leaving the TOP FEW HOOKS EMPTY. \nWRESTLERS (CHANTING TOGETHER) Mark! Mark! Mark! Mark!... \nMark hangs his OLYMPIC and WORLD CUP GOLDS on the top hooks. \nWRESTLERS (CONT'D) U.S.A! U.S.A! U.S.A!... \nDu Pont raises his bottle to Mark - \nDU PONT You've brought honor to Team Foxcatcher. \nHe starts to walk toward him. \nMARK I do - \nDU PONT - I pay for results not only on the mat, but in recruiting the best of the best to Foxcatcher Farms. That's part of your job. \nSilence. Mark looks shamed by this. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) It's probably best. Dave intimidates you. You don't believe you can ever do better than your brother. Glass ceiling. Impossible for you to break through. \nIt looks like perhaps Mark believes this as well. \nMARK (TENTATIVE) Do you think that's true? Because... all these years - \nDu Pont stands suddenly - \nDU PONT - Well. You're the public face of Foxcatcher. \nMARK If that's what - \nDU PONT - What do you know about Masters League wrestling tournaments? \nMARK Uh - well - not all that much - \nDU PONT - Because I'm thinking of entering one. \nBeat. Mark nods - \nMARK Okay... \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE ON: VIDEOTAPE image of Mark at the 1984 Olympics, his hand being raised by the ref... Mark raises both hands in the air, glances slightly down, then out at the crowd... \nThe image FREEZES, is rewound, plays again. At the moment Mark raises his arms and GLANCES DOWN, the image FREEZES. \nPHOTOGRAPHER (O.C.) This is the one. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM/BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS/DAY \nThe furniture has been pushed to the walls in the huge formal dining room, and a large WHITE SCRIM has been erected at one end. A FASHION PHOTOGRAPHER who could double as a member of Devo, stands at a video monitor with du Pont. \nPHOTOGRAPHER He wears the singlet - \nDU PONT - and the gold medal - \nPHOTOGRAPHER - and, of course, the gold medal. And a lot of oil. \nMark's in a dressing area wearing his FOXCATCHER SINGLET and Olympic gold. Two assistants stuff his crotch with a bit of padding. \nPHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) A lot of oil. Please. More oil. It defines the musculature. \nMark walks to his spot in front of the scrim. The two assistants slather baby oil on his arms and chest and legs as the photographer SHOWS him the pose on the monitor. \nPHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) You're winning the gold medal. You're raising your arms in triumph. You're also feeling humility. \nDu Pont is hanging back, but staring intensely at Mark. Mark looks over to him. \nMARK You good with this? \nDU PONT It's wonderful. It's exactly what I needed from you. \nThe photographer takes his place behind the camera as the assistants finish with the baby oil and clear away. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Good! Now. Mark. You're winning the gold medal! And you are humbled! \nMark raises his arms and glances down. FLASH. FLASH. \nPHOTOGRAPHER (CONT'D) Good! And again! \nJUMP TO: Du Pont, in his Foxcatcher sweatsuit, is now in front of the scrim with Mark (still in his singlet.) Mark starts to hug du Pont for a photo - \nDU PONT I think you were below me by a couple of steps when you hugged me at the Worlds. \nPHOTOGRAPHER It's true. \nDU PONT Maybe if you kneeled. \nMARK Kneeled now? On the floor. (UNSURE) Really? It won't look... \nCUT TO: \nINT. HILTON HOTEL, DC/BANQUET HALL - NIGHT \nMark's on stage, at the podium, READING from his Brandon- prepared remarks with - shall we say - some vigor... \nMARK ... highly respected ornithologist, author, world explorer, phil... phila... \nDu Pont watches from the wings, whispers: \nDU PONT Philatelist. \nMark looks over at him blankly - he has no idea what du Pont just said. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) Philatelist. (Mark just looks at him) PHILAT-- (GIVING UP) Stamp collector. \nMARK Stamp collector, and former pentathlete. \nJean, in the audience, in her wheelchair, almost imperceptibly shakes her head. \nMARK (CONT'D) Mr. Du Pont will be making his return to competitive sports in the over-50 category at the Masters' League du Pont Wrestling Invitational in Phoenix, Arizona this March. \nScattered applause, though no one has any idea what he's talking about. Du Pont watches from the wings. Mark reads. \nMARK (CONT'D) I'm so proud to introduce my mentor. He has the ability to look at me and see where I am in life. He knows how to motivate me. I feel his love for me as an athlete and as a human being. My mother and father were divorced when I was two years old. I spent a lifetime looking for a father... (MORE) \nMARK (CONT'D) and I found one in the Golden, uh... the Gold Eagle of America - John du Pont. \nApplause as du Pont strides onstage, hugs Mark. Du Pont turns, beaming (and a little hopped-up) to the audience - \nDU PONT Mark Schultz. Thank you, son. (waves to Jean in AUDIENCE) Hello, Mother. (to them all) The gold medal Mark won in 1984 was tarnished. Tarnished by Jimmy Carter. Tarnished by the unpatriotic acts of that democrat administration. He caused the entire Eastern bloc to boycott our Los Angeles Games. Mark will have an opportunity to shine up that medal at the World Championships in just a few short weeks. To prove his worth in front of the assembled nations of the globe... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - ESTABLISHING/LATE AFTERNOON \nSome time has passed. Lights are on in the windows of the Field House Gym. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOXCATCHER GYM - LATE AFTERNOON \nMark kneels on the mat with du Pont, holding him in the starting position. Mark is talking du Pont through the moves for an escape. \nWe get the sense that this is not the first of these lessons. \nMARK Ready? Go. \nDu Pont clumsily attempts the escape. Mark is incredibly gentle with him, even tender, easing him through the moves. \nMARK (CONT'D) Okay. Let's try it again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CHALET - NIGHT \nMark's HAIR IS NOW CUT SHORT AND BLEACHED WHITE. He's in shorts - no shirt - on the phone. He's sipping a beer, walking around the living room - \nMARK (ON PHONE) Yeah. I'm good. Yeah.... All good. \nINTERCUT with Dave in the U of W gym office, looking out over a wrestling team night practice. \nDAVE (ON PHONE) You working hard? \nMARK (ON PHONE) Yeah. No, I'm kind of giving myself a bit of a break right now. I'll ramp it up again as the trials come closer. \nDAVE (ON PHONE) All right. How close? \nThere a KNOCK on Mark's window. Mark looks over and sees du Pont standing outside, an eager look on his face. He beckons to Mark and moves TWO FINGERS as if cutting his own hair. \nMARK (to du Pont) Just a sec... \nDAVE (ON PHONE) What's that? \nMARK (ON PHONE) No, I wasn't - listen, I gotta run - \nDAVE (ON PHONE) What're you doing? \nMARK (ON PHONE) I just - I gotta run. \nMark doesn't move. \nSTAN BECK (CONT'D) You're going to have to do this later. \nMark's frozen, not knowing what to do, where to go... \nPRELAP: KNOCKING on a DOOR... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM/THE CHALET - THAT NIGHT/LATE \nMark awakens with a start to the sound of someone KNOCKING at the front door. He looks at the clock. It's 3 a.m. \nCUT TO: \nI/E. FRONT DOOR/THE CHALET - NIGHT \nMark opens the door to find du Pont standing there, in his SWEATS. He clearly hasn't been to bed. And it's clearly an artificial stimulant that's been keeping him awake. \nDU PONT New moves. Wrestling moves. Need to try them out. \nMARK Oh, uh - \nDU PONT In the gym. \nBeat. Mark forces the cobwebs from his head. \nMARK Yeah, of course. Just... just give me a minute. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOXCATCHER GYM - NIGHT \nMark and du Pont are down on the wrestling mat. Du Pont on top. He's both weirdly aggressive with Mark - trying to get him in various holds - and also, in the bizarre way he's pressing against Mark, quasi-sexual. Mark is BLANK-FACED. Just waiting for it to end. \nFADE OUT. \nEXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY \nWIDE SHOT of the Foxcatcher estate. In the distance, a HELICOPTER approaches, the rotors getting louder and louder. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - DAY \nThe helicopter has LANDED, the rotors still WHIRRING LOUDLY. (We won't hear dialogue in the following sequence.) \nDAVE and NANCY and the kids descend from the helicopter, GREETED warmly by the wrestling team. MARK IS ABSENT. \nDu Pont emerges from the Big House, trailed by Brandon. WE SEE du Pont notice what a warm reception Dave gets from the team. He comes down the steps, greets Dave and the family. \nCLOSE ON: Mark, who's at the very far end of the lawn, just inside the ring of trees, WATCHING. His HEAD is COMPLETELY SHAVED. \nMARK'S POV: Brandon and the team escort Nancy and the kids toward their new home. Du Pont and Dave ascend the Big House steps together. Du Pont puts his arm around Dave's shoulder. Far away, the Big House front door CLOSES. \nCUT TO: \nI/E. FRONT DOOR/THE CHALET - EARLY EVENING \nThe door OPENS. Mark has opened it from the inside. He's looking out at: Dave, on his porch. Beat. \nDAVE Hey. \nMARK Hey, Dave. \nDAVE How you doing? \nMARK Good. I'm good. \nDAVE I hadn't seen you yet. I just want to make sure everything's okay. \nMARK Yeah. I'm just concentrating. Trials are in 50 days. \nSilence. \nDAVE You know, Nancy and the kids are here. \nMARK How they doing? \nDU PONT Keep it up, gentlemen. \nLargely ignored, he drifts off into the weight room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WEIGHT ROOM/FOXCATCHER GYM - CONTINUOUS \nMark sits on the LEG-PRESS, pressing an enormous amount of weight - repeatedly - straining, pushing himself. \nDu Pont enters. Mark tries to ignore him, continues to press the huge stack of weights. \nDU PONT Your brother's taking the reins. Leading. \nMark finishes his set, stares straight ahead, catching his breath. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) You've got more in you than that. \nMark turns his gaze to du Pont. SILENCE. Du Pont walks over behind him, starts massaging Mark's shoulders. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) You've got to dig deep. Find out what's inside. Discover what you're made of. \nMARK (QUIET) Please don't do that. \nDu Pont keeps massaging. Mark glances towards the wrestling room. \nDU PONT Conquer your demons, Mark. CONQUER - \nMARK (QUIET) - Please. I'm asking you to not... \nDave is coming in the direction of the weight room. Mark STANDS and walks out of the gym. Du Pont turns and sees Dave come through the doorway. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CHALET - LATER \nCU on TV screen: Mark being taken down by a wrestler. The image pauses, plays again. And again. \nMark sits in front of the screen, watching this sequence, over and over. Dave walks in through the open door. Mark doesn't acknowledge him. \nDAVE Why'd you take off so suddenly? \nMARK (STILL WATCHING) Need to study up. Fix some weakness. \nDAVE You been doing this since you left? \nMARK Pretty much. \nBeat. Dave stands there as Mark keeps watching. \nDAVE What's going on with you and John? \nMARK (STILL WATCHING) Nothing's going on. (BEAT) What does that mean? \nDAVE You seemed kind of upset in the gym. \nMARK (STILL WATCHING) The fuck you talking about? \nDU PONT He was talking to you about something and you seemed pretty upset. (THEN) What was he saying to you? \nMARK I don't know what you're talking about. \nBeat. \nDAVE Okay. You want me to leave you alone, I'll leave you alone. You decide you want to talk, you know where to find me. \nDave walks out. Mark keeps watching his videotape. \nCUT TO: \nI/E. DU PONT'S CAR/FOXCATCHER - NEXT MORNING \nDu Pont drives his black Mercury. He's wearing what looks like an antique Revolutionary War General's battle COAT over a Foxcatcher t-shirt. There are a couple of MUSKETS in the back seat, another COAT. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DAVE'S HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - SAME TIME \nDave's got the hood of his car up. He's showing Alex how to change the oil filter. Danielle picks flowers in the yard and brings them to Nancy on the steps. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) Then... the whistle blows! \nDu Pont grabs onto Garcia. Tries to flip him. He can't move him at all. TOTAL SILENCE, except for Du Pont grunting. \nMrs. Du Pont, stoic - watches her son. Then she signals to her attendant to take her away. She's wheeled out. \nDu Pont sees her go. \nFADE OUT. \nINT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY \nDave wrestles. He's having trouble with a younger wrestler. \nMark stretches by the wall, alone, trying to concentrate on his upcoming match. He keeps glancing over at his struggling brother, and at du Pont in Dave's corner. \nCUT TO: \nDu Pont FANS Dave with a towel in between periods, \"coaching him\", giving \"advice\". He's BEING FILMED BY A CAMERA CREW. \nCUT TO: \nEnd of Dave's match. Mark watches the ref raise the other wrestler's hand. Mark's stunned. \nANNOUNCER (OVER P.A.) That's the second - and final - loss for David Schultz. \nDave graciously HUGS the other wrestler. ON MARK, watching, devastated, \nCUT TO: \nINT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - LATER/DAY \nMark's on the mat, battling a college wrestler, Rico Chipparelli. Mark's struggling. We see a vulnerability we haven't seen before - something lost or disoriented. Dave shouts from the corner. \nDAVE Get after him, Mark! Shoot low!... \nDu Pont, BEING FILMED, claps, calls out instruction - \nDU PONT Need to get after him, there. Low low low. \nCUT TO: \nIn between periods, Mark sits in the chair in his corner while Dave gets in his face, coaching. But all Mark can pay attention to is du Pont clumsily FANNING him with a towel. \nDAVE He's open to the left. He leaves his entire left side open. You gotta get after that fucker! Make him pay. Now or never... \nCUT TO: \nMark's back out on the mat. It's not working. Mark gets PINNED. The wrestlers stand. The ref holds both of their hands, RAISES Chipparelli's arm. He turns them around, raises Chipparelli's arm again. \nMark walks off the mat. Dave tries to console him. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Double elimination, buddy. You'll get it back. \nDU PONT Next time, Mark. A good effort. \nMark walks right past them, off the mats. We TRAIL him, staying with him as he walks straight out the arena door. \nEXT. PARKING LOT/WRESTLING ARENA - CONTINUOUS \nMark walks out the door and along the side of the building. He turns down a side entrance ramp for delivery trucks leading down to an underground garage. \nI/E. DELIVERY TUNNEL/WRESTLING ARENA - CONTINUOUS \nMark's alone here. He BANGS his head against the cement wall, smashing it repeatedly. He screams at himself. He punches himself. Punishment for losing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARK'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nMark, still in his wrestling clothes, sits on the edge of his bed in front of a ROOM SERVICE CART loaded with food. His face is bloody. He gorges himself on fried chicken, sandwiches, french fries. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARK'S HOTEL ROOM - LATER \nMark's on his knees at the room MINI-BAR, having discovered the Kit-Kat's, M&Ms. TV's on, place is a wreck. A KNOCK at the door. LOUDER. Mark looks through the peephole. His POV: \nDAVE Open up - I know you're in there. \nDAVE Wait! Wait! We're here... (TO MARK) Get 'em off. \nThe official looks at them, OPENS his log book. Dave helps Mark peel off his sweats. Soaked, they hit the floor with a smack. Mark, in his singlet, gets on the scale. \nHe's 30 GRAMS OVERWEIGHT (5 ounces). He steps off, and Dave helps PEEL his singlet off. He gets back on the scale naked. The official slides the weight bar... \n3 GRAMS OVER. Dave grabs Mark. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Come here. \nHe grabs his wallet from his sweats pocket and pulls out a CREDIT CARD, dropping the wallet on the floor. Dave SQUEEGEES sweat off Mark's naked body with the card. Scraping him down. \nHe helps Mark back on the scale. The pointer bobs, finally reaches equilibrium. \nOFFICIAL 82 kilos. \nMark practically COLLAPSES. Dave helps him off the scale, walks him over to a bench, sits him down. He grabs a GATORADE from nearby table and hold it out to Mark, who looks like he might pass out. \nDAVE Mark. Drink. \nMark just sits there. Not taking the drink. \nDAVE (CONT'D) Mark... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY \nMark SLAMS his opponent, Mike Sheets, to the mat. He's like an animal, dominating, aggressive. \nDave coaches from Mark's corner. \nINT. WRESTLING ARENA/PENSACOLA - DAY \nA SERIES OF QUICK CUTS OF MARK'S MATCHES: Mark dominating, turning his opponents, taking them down... \nTHEN: The END WHISTLE of Mark's final match. The wrestlers stand and the referee RAISES MARK'S ARM... \nDAVE YAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHH! \nDave's EXULTANT - leaping and screaming onto the mat - he grabs his brother in a BEAR HUG and LIFTS him off the mat. \nAs Dave joyfully carries his exhausted, victorious brother around the mat, he glances over at where du Pont would be sitting. Empty seat. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT \nDave walks down the long hall checking door numbers. He stops to KNOCK on one. After a moment, Stan Beck opens the door. \nDAVE Hey, Stan. \nSTAN BECK Dave. What can I do for you? \nDAVE I'm having some trouble finding John. He's not in his room - \nSTAN BECK - Right. \nDAVE - I wanted to check in with him. I had a kind of uncomfortable thing with John before the match this afternoon - Mark was in a really delicate place, and I had to ask John to not be in his corner. I just wanted to make sure he's okay with everything. And that he's happy with the result. With how things turned out. \nSTAN BECK Dave. Mr. du Pont's mother died this morning. He flew home to Philadelphia earlier today. \nOn Dave, stunned. \nDylan's \"All the Tired Horses\" STARTS TO PLAY. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE/TROPHY ROOM - DAY \n\"All the Tired Horses\" PLAYS. \nC/U on Jean du Pont's face in an OIL PAINTING. \nSHOTS of her horse-jumping ribbons; PHOTOS of Jean riding; the space John cleared for his wrestlers' MEDALS; John's Masters' Tournament winner's PLAQUE. \nA SHOT of the POSTER of Mark oiled-up, hanging on the wall. \nCUT TO: \nDave has to laugh. \nDAVE Congrats, my brother. \nAs Mark walks into the Chalet, he looks over toward the Big House, where he can see a SECURITY DETAIL fanned out on the lawn, sweeping the ground with metal detectors. \nIN THE CAR: Dave looks down at envelope in his hand. \nNANCY What you got, baby? \nOpens it. Beat. \nDAVE John wrote me a check for ten thousand dollars. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOXCATCHER - MORNING \nWIDE SHOT as du Pont trudges across the lawn toward the Field House in Foxcatcher sweats. After a few moments, he's followed by a LARGE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD in a dark suit... and by Stan Beck. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOXCATCHER GYM - MORNING \nWrestlers warm up, work out, lift weights. Dave and Mark train intensively together, doing TAKE-DOWN DRILLS. Mark executes, Dave murmurs instruction to Mark, they do the drill again. \nDu Pont WALKS IN THE GYM, trailed by the his Plainclothes Security Guard and Stan. Du Pont looks like he hasn't showered in a few days. \nDave moves toward John, offering greetings and condolences -- \"How you doing there, Coach,\" \"Sorry to hear about your mother, sir,\" etc. \nDu Pont brushes off the offers of sympathy - \nDU PONT No no. All's fine. There's work to be done. (CLAPS) Back to work, gentlemen. \nAs they go back to their drills, John stays on the perimeter, watching Mark, STARING at them. It's disconcerting. \nDave moves back to work with Mark. \nDAVE Mark. Focus. Look at me. (Mark looks at him) Focus on me. (MARK NODS) You here? (MARK NODS) Let's run it again. \nMark tries to run the takedown, Dave escapes, he spins on Mark and takes him down hard. As they stand up, Dave smacks MARK - \nDAVE (CONT'D) Get your head on straight and do this. \nDu Pont walks over. Mark can barely look at him. Du Pont stops close to Mark. \nMark looks to Dave to save him from this. Dave's clearly caught in the middle. \nMark looks down, closes his eyes as if in pain. Du Pont moves close to Dave, speaking to him so Mark can hear - \nDU PONT If you and I can't get him there, no one can. We're in this together. \nAfter a long moment, du Pont moves off the mat. He starts to stretch nearby. As Dave tries to get Mark back to work, du Pont starts to JOG around the perimeter of the gym. Mark's trying to keep it together, but it's clearly driving him insane. As du Pont jogs and jogs - \nPRELAP: \nDU PONT (V.O.) Our challenge... as coaches... as leaders. I have coached... and psychologically prepare... Our Mark Schultz. To capture Olympic Gold... \nCUT TO: \nINT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - DAY \nC/U of du Pont. HE'S SPEAKING DIRECTLY TO CAMERA. We're not sure where we are yet. He speaks haltingly, with effort, trying to be authoritative. \nDU PONT ...I wear many hats. I am leader. Mentor. Father figure. Brother. Older brother. At times the younger... \nINT. DU PONT'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - DAY \nFrom a WIDER ANGLE, we see that he's being FILMED for the documentary. He wears his Foxcatcher sweat jacket with HEAD COACH and JOHN `Eagle' du PONT\" stitched onto it. \nDU PONT It will not be easy. We have built... our family. Our obligation... is to build... winners... In life. To teach the secret... To build men who will... think of... Who will understand... the character traits... We must teach them... whether they will listen or no. \nHe's finished. Silence. He stares steadily into the camera. Then he twitches. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE/VARIOUS - NIGHT \nA SECURITY TEAM taps on the outside of the main house, listen to the walls with what look like giant STETHOSCOPES. \nMARK Were you in the Big House yesterday? \nDAVE For a little while. \nMARK In the afternoon? Because I got turned away when I came within fifty yards of the house. (THEN) What were you doing there? \nDAVE I'm a coach here. I get paid by John. I was meeting with John. \nMARK About what? \nDAVE Mark. Get dressed. \nMARK He's weakening me. \nDAVE What are you talking about? \nMARK I talked to Bachman at SMU last night. He says they're expanding the program. There'll be room for both of us in the fall - \nDAVE - Mark - \nMARK - I told him we could all get on the phone next weekend - \nDAVE - You need to focus on what's happening a month from now. Not - \nMARK - SMU's gonna make a move, they're gonna take a run at it - we can be there at the beginning - \nDAVE - Don't do this. Don't do it. Stay clear about what we're working for. \nMARK - I can't do this anymore. I can't do it - \nDAVE - It's not the time, Mark - \nMARK - John's killing me here - \nDAVE - He's not killing you - \nMARK - If we at least let Bachman know by the end of the week we'll have a place to go to after - \nDAVE - Stop. Stop it! \nLong beat as Dave looks at Mark. As gently as he can: \nDAVE (CONT'D) I will make sure you're taken care of after Seoul. I'll talk to John - whatever you decide: you want to stay, you want to go - I'll make sure you're taken care of. \nMark's looking at his brother, something dawning on him for the first time. \nMARK You're not thinking of staying here...? \nDAVE I don't know, Mark. The schools are great, the kids are happy. They have eight hundred acres to run around in... \nMark's at a complete loss. Just when he'd reconnected with his brother, it seems they'll be separated again. \nDAVE (CONT'D) If you win next month you're in a class by yourself, you write your own ticket. You live your own life however you want. Focus on that. \nMARK (QUIETLY) My own life. \nDAVE That's right. \nMARK And you'll be here. \nDAVE I'll be here. Whenever you need me. \nMark seems lost. Dave pats him on the shoulder and turns to walk toward his office. Mark watches him walk away, then - \nMARK What's on your forehead? \nDAVE What? \nMARK It says kids. \nDAVE To remind me to pick up the kids from school. \nMARK What does that mean? When are you gonna you see your own forehead? \nDAVE I don't have to. You just told me. \nOn Mark, PRELAP: \nCORPORAL Here we go, sir. Five tons of fun. \nDu Pont BREAKS the surface. He looks around, then swims slowly to shore. The tank remains on the bottom of the pond. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DU PONT'S OFFICE - DAY \nDave and Mark sit on the couch across from Stan Beck and du Pont. Dave is firm and clear, but entirely diplomatic. Du Pont looks dishevelled, he won't meet anyone's gaze. We can see the POSTER of Mark hanging on the wall. \nDAVE I'll commit to remaining at Foxcatcher so long as John wants me here, but only if my brother is taken care of. \nSTAN BECK Taken care of how? \nDAVE So long as I'm here, Mark will continue to be paid. \nSTAN BECK Paid what? \nDAVE His full salary. \nSTAN BECK You want him paid even if he leaves? What if he quits? \nDAVE Whether or not he chooses to stay. That's right. \nStan's incredulous. He glances over at du Pont, but his boss doesn't make eye contact. Stan turns back to Dave. \nSTAN BECK You're making quite an assumption about the value of your presence here. \nDAVE You're welcome to test the theory. \nSTAN BECK What does that mean? \nDAVE We can see how many wrestlers stay if I decide to go. (BEAT) I hope it doesn't come to that. (BEAT) I'd also ask John to understand the delicate nature of the lead-up to Seoul, and please allow Mark some space. Let him train just with me. \nDu Pont winces at this, but keeps quiet. \nSTAN BECK (TO MARK) You're that determined to leave? \nMark doesn't respond. \nDAVE He'd like the option. \nStan leans over to du Pont and WHISPERS in his ear. It goes on for several seconds. Finally, du Pont NODS very slightly. \nSTAN BECK First of all, Mark has always been free to train in whatever - \nDAVE - That's not exactly how it's - \nSTAN BECK - Just a minute - you've had your say. \nDAVE Sorry. \nSTAN BECK - To train in whatever way is most effective for him. Eagle offers his advice and counsel. If Mark chooses to ignore it, that's his loss. (THEN) Mr. du Pont would be prepared to accept your financial terms, but only if we get an answer to what we proposed weeks ago. \nDAVE What's that? \nSTAN BECK That John du Pont, Head Coach of Team Foxcatcher, be seated in Mark's corner throughout the Olympic Games. \nMark looks at Dave. Quiet, betrayed -- \nMARK You've talked about this? \nDAVE I was waiting for the right moment to bring it up with you. You haven't exactly been in a receptive frame of mind. \nA long beat. Then Mark shrugs, and looks away from his brother. He's given up fighting this fight. \nSTAN BECK All right, then. I guess we're done. \nSilence as they all just sit there. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. OLYMPIC STADIUM/HALLWAY/SEOUL - DAY \nC/U on Mark, in his wrestling gear, looking disoriented, unfocused. He's in the hall right outside the locker room, just steps away from the WRESTLING ARENA. Dave's in his face - talking to him INTENSELY over the sounds of the crowd inside - \nDAVE This is your moment to prove yourself - your moment to step out alone, away from everyone, into the spotlight. This has nothing to do with me, nothing to do with John - \nDu Pont hovers a few feet behind Dave, being filmed by his CAMERA CREW. Mark's eyes keep glancing over at him. \nDAVE (CONT'D) - nothing to do with anyone but you. This is you, Mark. This is you. Focus and take what's yours! \nOVER the last of these shots, WE HEAR a DEEP, OVERLY DRAMATIC VOICE coming from a TV: \nVIDEO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ... He's coached national and world champions with his unique blend of passion and inspiration... \nC/U of a TV SCREEN: a SERIES OF IMAGES: Mark Schultz winning matches (one of the images is the one that became the Foxcatcher poster); Dave winning; Dan Bane winning..... \nTHEN, on screen, is the scene of du Pont \"teaching\" Mark a WRESTLING MOVE: \nDU PONT From the under hook, pivot sideways while pulling down on his arm. Kneel between his legs and take him to the mat. \nMark lets du Pont take him down, though it's abundantly apparent how much Mark is gritting his teeth through this. \nINT. LARGE EMPTY ROOM/BIG HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nWE SEE where we are: a huge empty room - once used for grand dances. \nIn a corner: du Pont and the Documentary Director sit on two chairs in front of a TV hooked up to a VCR. The Director is screening \"The John du Pont Story\" for his boss. \nDu Pont has a PISTOL tucked in his waistband. \nON THE VIDEO: A SHOT OF: Mark finding du Pont in the stands at the Worlds and hugging him tightly. \nA SHOT OF: Mark winning the Olympic Trials and Dave HUGGING and LIFTING his brother into the air. \nA SHOT OF: du Pont watching this from the stands and raising his fist in the air. \nA SHOT OF: Dave talking to the camera in the Foxcatcher gym: \nDAVE He's made himself an - an expert in the art and sport of wrestling... \nDave stumbles on the words - \nDAVE (CONT'D) Eagle is indispensable to - uh - what it... what we're trying to accomplish here. \nDave looks down, obviously uncomfortable - \nDAVE (CONT'D) We... consider John... one of us. (QUIETLY) One of us. \nA SHOT OF: du Pont talking to the camera, haltingly - trying so hard to be authoritative, inspirational: \nDU PONT Our challenge... as coaches... as leaders. I have coached... and psychologically prepare... our Mark Schultz... to capture Olympic Gold. I wear many hats. I am leader. Mentor. Father figure. Brother. \nA SHOT of a GOLDEN EAGLE sitting on a tree branch, then flying away. \nVIDEO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) The symbol of America is the Golden Eagle... \nA SHOT of du Pont climbing into the pilot seat of his helicopter. He puts on his headset. \nVIDEO ANNOUNCER (V.O.) John du Pont is that Golden Eagle. \nDu Pont takes off in the helicopter and flies away. Over this shot, the end title comes up: \"THE GOLDEN EAGLE OF AMERICA - THE JOHN DU PONT STORY.\" \nTHE TAPE ENDS. The TV screen goes to static snow. \nSILENCE. Du Pont sits there, Director next to him. Finally, du Pont stands and starts for the door. Director follows. \nDOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR We've bought several time slots next week on local station WPHI - \nDU PONT (STILL MOVING) Good. \nDOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR - Several late night slots, of course, but there was also an open afternoon half-hour, directly after \"The Edge of Night.\" That should be a good one - \nDu Pont continues right out the door, down the hallway, not even turning to face him. \nDU PONT Excellent. \nThe Director stops at the door. He calls out to du Pont -- \nDOCUMENTARY DIRECTOR - I'll let you know what the viewership numbers are as soon as I have them. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BIG HOUSE - DAY \nDu Pont walks out a SIDE DOOR of the Big House, followed by the LARGE PLAINCLOTHES SECURITY GUARD. \nHe continues toward his car - the BLACK MERCURY - goes to the driver's side. Then, something catches his eye in a nearby tree - he points it out the Security Guard: \nDU PONT Northern Cardinal. Look at that. \n", "test1_input": "MARK Why does she... \nHe trails off. Then, a bit desperate - \nMARK (CONT'D) The deer hunting on his farm's supposed to be amazing... \nDave speaks gently. \nDAVE I got a good thing going here. I got a contract. Nancy's happy, Alex likes his school... \nThe reality starts to hit Mark that he may be doing this alone, without his older brother. He's shell-shocked. \nMARK The Worlds are sixty days away. \nDAVE Tell me your plan. Who you gonna train with? \nMARK (LOST) Du Pont's taking his money out of the Villanova program. They'll pull the plug on that. So. Dan Bane could come. I - I guess Dan Bane. (beat, then, very quietly) I don't know how to do this without you. \nDAVE Do what? \nThe answer is \"everything\" -- but Mark just shakes his head. \nDAVE (CONT'D) It sounds like an opportunity. \nMARK Does it? \nDAVE I think you could make something of it. \nMARK Do you? (DAVE NODS) A spot's always open for you if you decide to come. \nDAVE Thank you. \nDave steps forward and holds out his arms - \nDAVE (CONT'D) Congrats, little brother. \nMark steps into his brother's arms, folding into him, head on his chest, holding on for dear life. Nancy looks over. \nCUT TO: \nI/E. MARK'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nMark packs his apartment - trashing just about everything, tossing it in the dumpster - stuffing the few essentials in his AMC GREMLIN. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DRIVING - DAY \nMark drives across Ohio. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FILLING STATION - DAY \nMark gets gas. The attendant - clearly a HIGH SCHOOL WRESTLER - shakes his hand. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - DAY \nMark pulls onto the estate grounds. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FRONT DOOR/BIG HOUSE - DAY \nMark rings the doorbell. No answer. He goes to ring it again and the door is opened by a UNIFORMED MAID. \nMARK Hi. I'm Mark Schultz. \nSilence. That means nothing to her. \nMARK (CONT'D) I'm here to see John du Pont? \nUNIFORMED MAID Is Mr. du Pont expecting you? \nMARK Yeah. Well - not today exactly, but, yes. This week. Sometime. \nUNIFORMED MAID Just a moment, please. \n", "test1_true": "She SHUTS the door, leaving him outside. He turns and looks out over the VAST LAWN of the estate. Far off, it's being mowed by a gardener. \nUNIFORMED MAID (opening the door) Please. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BIG HOUSE/FOXCATCHER - CONTINUOUS \nThey walk just a few feet and she gestures toward a door. \nMARK (CONFUSED) Is he? He's in there? \nUNIFORMED MAID The washroom. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ROCOCO WASHROOM/BIG HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER \nFloral wallpaper, gold fixtures and faucet. Mark pisses - mouth open, eyes half shut. He flushes. \nHe looks at a dish holding little pastel horseshoes. Soap? He picks one up, smells it. Washes his hands - monstrous with the tiny soap. He wipes his hands on his pants, avoiding the neatly hung towelettes. He opens the door. \nUNIFORMED MAID Mr. Beck will see you now. \nMark doesn't know who Mr. Beck is. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STAN BECK'S OFFICE/BIG HOUSE - MINUTES LATER \nMark is let into a large third floor office with a big desk, wood filing cabinets, LAW BOOKS lining the bookshelves. \nSTAN BECK (mid-forties, no-nonsense, suit and tie) rises from behind the desk as Mark enters. \nSTAN BECK Come in, sit down. \nMARK Thanks. \nSTAN BECK Thank you, Rosie. \nUNIFORMED MAID You're welcome, Mr. Beck. \nShe exits, closing the door behind her. \nSTAN BECK Okay. Okay. So. Mark Schultz, correct? \nMARK Yes. \nSTAN BECK (opens a folder, writing) S-C-H-U-L-T-Z? \nMARK That's right. \nSTAN BECK ... M-A-R-K? \nMark just looks at him. Beat. Then he nods. \nSTAN BECK (CONT'D) All right. Mark. I manage affairs for Mr. du Pont. Look after his interests. If you have a problem, you come to me. If Mr. Du Pont has a problem, I'll come to you. Okay? \nMARK Sounds okay. \nSTAN BECK Let's talk about what you're doing here. I'd like to make sure we all understand each other. Does that sound like a good policy to you? \nMARK That could be a good policy. \nSTAN BECK Good. I think so, too. First thing I can tell you is that Mr. du Pont is very happy he can help you with your goals. But I want to make sure you're aware of what's expected. It's not a free ride. In exchange for the guest house, the more than substantial salary, the privilege of training at Foxcatcher Farms, Mr. du Pont expects results. Understood? \nMARK Yes. \nSTAN BECK I'm sure you can appreciate that. \nMARK Of course. \nSTAN BECK That goes for every wrestler. \nMARK I've actually got suggestions for about half the roster. \nHe pulls a creased, folded piece of paper from his pocket. \nSTAN BECK What about the other half? \n", "test1_id": 903, "test2_input": "MARK (BEAT) I've been making phone calls. \nSTAN BECK I'll take a look at that when you've finished. All right. Now. \nStan takes out a form, writes on it as Mark puts away list. \nSTAN BECK (CONT'D) Your age? \nMARK Twenty-seven. \nSTAN BECK Education? \nMARK Oklahoma University. \nSTAN BECK Undergraduate? \nMARK Yes. \nSTAN BECK You graduated? \nMARK Yes. \nSTAN BECK Do you own any property? \nMARK No. \nSTAN BECK Are your parents still married? \nMARK (BEAT) No. \nSTAN BECK How old were you when they separated? \nMARK Two. \nSTAN BECK Have you ever been accused of a crime? \nMARK No. \nThe DOOR OPENS and John du Pont pokes his head in. Mark STANDS, relieved to see him finally -- \nMARK (CONT'D) Mr. du Pont. \nDu Pont seems surprised to see Mark. He stays in the doorway, waves slightly. \nDU PONT Ah. Hello. You've arrived. \nMARK Yes sir, I drove straight down. \nIt's a little odd that du Pont doesn't enter - he seems nervous. He looks at Stan. Stan hands him a sheet of paper. \nSTAN Tonight's speech. All set. \nJohn takes the paper and glances at it. Then - \nDU PONT They're setting him up in the chalet? \nSTAN BECK Yes, sir. \nDU PONT Excellent bed. Firm mattress. (SILENCE) Good for the lower back. \nMARK Great. \nDU PONT All right. \nMARK All right. Thank you, sir. \nAnd du Pont's gone, closing the door behind him. Beat. \nSTAN BECK Shall we finish this? \nMark sits. \nSTAN BECK (CONT'D) Have you ever been sued? \nMARK No. \nSTAN BECK Have you ever initiated a lawsuit? \nCUT TO: \n", "test2_true": "Brandon walks with Mark. They've come far, across the huge side yard - the Big House looks small behind them. \nMark can see HORSE STABLES that let out onto a huge fenced track with a grass infield. Stable hands are putting several thoroughbred horses through their paces. \nBRANDON (re the horses) They're Mrs. du Pont's. We all just keep our distance. \nThey enter the WOODS. Just inside the trees is THE CHALET - a European style wooden guest house that is now Mark's home. \nMARK I didn't realize he was married. \nBRANDON Mr. du Pont? He's not. Mrs. du Pont's his mother. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CHALET - AFTERNOON \nBrandon lets Mark in the door, turns on the lights in the living room, in the kitchen, goes to the bedroom. It's decorated like a ski chalet. Brandon walks back from the bedroom, holding KEYS out to Mark- \nBRANDON Utilities are paid for - gas, electric. Refrigerator's stocked for now, but in the future you're responsible for feeding yourself. Unless of course you get invited to the Big House for dinner. \nMark, still standing in the entry-way, accepts the keys. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) Someone will bring your car around. Anything else you need? \nMARK Has he always lived with his mother? \nBRANDON Mr. du Pont? I think so. \nBrandon leaves. Mark stands still for a long time, gazing at his new home - including some of the oddities, like the POLAR BEAR SKIN RUG (with HEAD ON) which is draped over the sofa. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CHALET - LATE THAT NIGHT \nMark (in tank-top undershirt) tapes up PHOTOS of himself and Dave. The POLAR BEAR HEAD on the rug gazes blankly at him. A KNOCK on the living room window. It's John du Pont, who points toward the front door. \nEXT. PORCH/THE CHALET - CONTINUOUS/LATE NIGHT \nMark opens the door. John's standing on the little porch, wearing a tux, holding a BOOK and a SMALL BOX. \nMARK Mr. du Pont, I want to thank you FOR - \nDu Pont holds up a finger. Mark STOPS. Du Pont whispers - \nDU PONT You hear that? \nMark listens, shakes his head. Du Pont holds up his finger again - and then we HEAR it: a faint HOOTING from the woods. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) Barred owl - \nHe hands Mark the small box he's holding. Inside is a very small set of BINOCULARS. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) When you spot one, you'll see with each hoot there's a white flash in his collar. His throat swells, and he reveals to you the lighter feathers he keeps hidden underneath. \nHe hands Mark the BOOK: \"South Pacific Birds\" by John Eleuthere du Pont. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) It's from ten years ago, but I thought you might find it interesting. \nMARK You wrote this? \nDU PONT I did. \nMark seems genuinely touched and impressed. \nMARK Thank you. Do you want to come in? \nDU PONT No no - \nMARK - The fridge is full - you probably know better than me what's in there- \nDU PONT - No. You need your rest. You need to get started bright and early. \nDu Pont hold up his own set of binoculars. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) - I had a wonderful night a few years back when I spotted all eight Northeast species. Right here on the farm. (THEN) What do we have - two months to the Worlds? \nMARK Not even. 54 days. \nDU PONT 54 days. (BEAT) We'll get it done. \n", "test2_id": 904, "test3_input": "Through large OPEN DOORS, in the adjoining gym, a larger crowd cheers on a number of NCAA wrestlers. FRED COLE and another USA WRESTLING OFFICIAL look in from the other gym. They SEE the posters of Mark on the walls, and they SEE: \nAn exhausted du Pont, in his Foxcatcher singlet, is slumped in his chair, encouraging Mark to massage his shoulders. Mark OBLIGES. Mark glances at the OPEN DOORS, notices Fred Cole. Self-conscious, he ignores Cole and focuses on John. \nMARK When he gives you the slightest opening, you gotta shoot in on him. Be aggressive. Show him who's boss. \nDu Pont nods wearily. He can barely move. \nCUT TO: \nThe final minute of the match. It's clearly RIGGED. The OTHER WRESTLER is trying to let the exhausted du Pont get the best of him. Mark watches. \nThe REF blows the end of match whistle. The wrestlers stand, du Pont struggling to his feet. The ref takes each of their hands, and raises... du Pont's. He's \"won\". \nDu Pont limps off the mat. He approaches Mark, THROWS his arms around him the way Mark hugged du Pont at the Worlds. Mark glances toward the open doors to the other gym. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LOCKER ROOM/PHOENIX ARENA - MINUTES LATER \nMark and an exhausted du Pont enter the locker room. Mark SEES, off in a corner, Brandon speaking quietly with the OTHER WRESTLER from du Pont's match. He watches Brandon HAND the other wrestler an ENVELOPE. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - EVENING/ESTABLISHING \nThe helicopter is on the lawn, blades slowing, shutting down. \nDU PONT (V.O.) I've rearranged some of the horse ribbons, Mother... \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEAN DU PONT'S ROOMS/FOXCATCHER - EVENING \nJohn is seated in front of his mother, next to a window in her third floor room. She's in her wheelchair, with the oxygen tubes in her nose, imperious as ever. \nDU PONT ... Some of the older prizes in the trophy case. (MORE) \nDU PONT (CONT'D) To make room for Team Foxcatcher medals.... For the wrestling awards. \nSilence. Jean just looks at her son, not reacting. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) Including this, Mother. Ha. Which I've actually just won. \nHe takes his WINNER'S PLAQUE out of a duffel bag, trying to be casual, but seeming all the more like an eager 9 year-old. He holds it out for her. She doesn't take it, but leans forward slightly to read what's inscribed on it: \"FIRST PLACE, OVER-50, DU PONT MASTER'S INVITATIONAL: JOHN `EAGLE' DU PONT.\" She sits back. \nJEAN Which ribbons? \nDU PONT I'm sorry? \nJEAN Which ribbons did you move? \nDU PONT Just some of the older ones. From the case. From the Rosemont case. \nSilence. \nJEAN I'll have a look later to see exactly what you've done. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TROPHY ROOM - DAY \nC/U's of Jean's ribbons in the case, horse photos, etc. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOXCATCHER ESTATE - NEXT MORNING/ESTABLISHING \nOn the vast lawn, the gardener drives his mower. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOXCATCHER GYM - LATE MORNING \nDu Pont, in Foxcatcher sweats, walks in. The gym is EMPTY. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GARCIA AND ZEREGA'S BUNGALOW/FOXCATCHER - LATE MORNING \n", "test3_true": "There's KNOCKING at the door, but the guys don't notice it. Much LOUDER KNOCKING. Garcia opens the door. It's du Pont. Mark RISES to greet him as Dan MUTES the video. \nMARK (COMPLETELY GENUINE) Hi, Boss. How you doing? Any soreness from the match? \nDU PONT I went by the gym - it's almost noon - and there's no one in there. There is no one in there. In the gym. \nMARK Yeah, no, exactly - we've got an intense workout scheduled this afternoon. Real intense one. So we're taking the morning to rest up. \nDU PONT Who precisely is in charge around here? \nMARK Well, I mean, I am. \nDU PONT Where do we stand on Dave? \nMARK (BEAT) On what? \nDU PONT David Schultz. Your brother. When is he coming to Foxcatcher? \nBeat. Mark glances at the other guys. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) We need someone to take charge around here, someone to lead. \nMARK John, seriously, I don't know how else to say it. It's not gonna happen. You can't buy Dave. It's just not gonna happen. \nDu Pont SLAPS Mark. HARD. Across the face. SILENCE. \nMark could destroy du Pont. He doesn't seem to even consider it. He just stands there, like a chastened schoolboy, his face reddening. Du Pont WALKS OUT past the muted UFC on TV - \nOnce he's gone, no one speaks. Then: \nGARCIA You got bitch-slapped. \nMark turns to Garcia. \nGARCIA (CONT'D) Oh shit. \nGarcia runs into the other room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM/THE CHALET - DAY \nMark stands at the sink STARING at his reflection as the mirror fogs over from the RUNNING SHOWER: bleached hair, one side of his face is red where du Pont slapped him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM/THE CHALET - DAY \nMark sits on the edge of his bed. He's neatly dressed, his wet hair brushed. His face shaved. He doesn't move. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOXCATCHER LAWN - DAY \nMark walks quickly across the vast lawn toward the Big House. \nCUT TO: \nINT. OFFICE ENTRANCE/BIG HOUSE - DAY \nMark enters the Big House through the rear office entrance. No one's in the reception area. \nMARK Hello?... Hello? \nHe starts up the stairs, two at a time. Stan Beck comes out of his office, meets him at the top. \nSTAN BECK Mark. How are things? \nMARK I need to see John. \nSTAN BECK Mr. du Pont's not available right now. \nMARK Stan, please. I need to see him. \nSTAN BECK He's got a very full schedule this afternoon. But I'll let him know you stopped by. \nMARK (more and more upset) Listen - I - something happened. There was a - misunderstanding. I think I did something wrong and I really need to talk to him about it- \nSTAN BECK - Mark, I hear you. But Mr. du Pont's away for the afternoon on business. He's simply not here. \n", "test3_id": 905}

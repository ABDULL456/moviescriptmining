You've arrived. \nMARK Yes sir, I drove straight down. \nIt's a little odd that du Pont doesn't enter - he seems nervous. He looks at Stan. Stan hands him a sheet of paper. \nSTAN Tonight's speech.

They've come far, across the huge side yard - the Big House looks small behind them. \nMark can see HORSE STABLES that let out onto a huge fenced track with a grass infield. Stable hands are putting several thoroughbred horses through their paces. \nBRANDON (re the horses) They're Mrs. du Pont's. We all just keep our distance. \nThey enter the WOODS. Just inside the trees is THE CHALET - a European style wooden guest house that is now Mark's home. \nMARK I didn't realize he was married. \nBRANDON Mr. du Pont? He's not. Mrs. du Pont's his mother. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THE CHALET - AFTERNOON \nBrandon lets Mark in the door, turns on the lights in the living room, in the kitchen, goes to the bedroom. It's decorated like a ski chalet. Brandon walks back from the bedroom, holding KEYS out to Mark- \nBRANDON Utilities are paid for - gas, electric. Refrigerator's stocked for now, but in the future you're responsible for feeding yourself. Unless of course you get invited to the Big House for dinner. \nMark, still standing in the entry-way, accepts the keys. \nBRANDON (CONT'D) Someone will bring your car around. Anything else you need? \nMARK Has he always lived with his mother? \nBRANDON Mr. du Pont? I think so. \nBrandon leaves.

THE CHALET - LATE THAT NIGHT \nMark (in tank-top undershirt) tapes up PHOTOS of himself and Dave. The POLAR BEAR HEAD on the rug gazes blankly at him. A KNOCK on the living room window.

John's standing on the little porch, wearing a tux, holding a BOOK and a SMALL BOX. \nMARK Mr. du Pont, I want to thank you FOR - \nDu Pont holds up a finger. Mark STOPS. Du Pont whispers - \nDU PONT You hear that? \nMark listens, shakes his head. Du Pont holds up his finger again - and then we HEAR it: a faint HOOTING from the woods. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) Barred owl - \nHe hands Mark the small box he's holding. Inside is a very small set of BINOCULARS. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) When you spot one, you'll see with each hoot there's a white flash in his collar. His throat swells, and he reveals to you the lighter feathers he keeps hidden underneath. \nHe hands Mark the BOOK: \"South Pacific Birds\" by John Eleuthere du Pont. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) It's from ten years ago, but I thought you might find it interesting. \nMARK You wrote this? \nDU PONT I did. \nMark seems genuinely touched and impressed. \nMARK Thank you. Do you want to come in? \nDU PONT No no - \nMARK - The fridge is full - you probably know better than me what's in there- \nDU PONT - No. You need your rest. You need to get started bright and early. \nDu Pont hold up his own set of binoculars. \nDU PONT (CONT'D) - I had a wonderful night a few years back when I spotted all eight Northeast species.

It's exactly what I needed from you. \nThe photographer takes his place behind the camera as the assistants finish with the baby oil and clear away. \nPHOTOGRAPHER Good! Now. Mark.

We might have a couple of those left on the lot. (to du Pont) You gonna need financing? \nEveryone laughs. Du Pont smiles. \nDU PONT What I need is the gun turret. Don't send me one without that MK- 19 mounted on top. \nGENERAL Uh... I don't know there, son. Civilians don't usually get 40mm blowback grenade launchers. \nSTEVE General, John du Pont is hardly your usual civilian. \nThe General turns back to the Senator, grumbling - \nGENERAL Am I supposed to get him a 12-pack of live fucking grenades, too? \n", "test3_id": 905}

Cooper is still problem solving, thinking. 
COOPER We could bypass the relay. Send a conventional shortwave signal. 
BRAND Only a tiny portion of the signal would make it though the wormhole. Besides, no one will be listening anymore. 
The comms screen is dead. No movement. Nothing. 
Cooper looks at Brand, realizing something. 
COOPER You knew, didn't you? You and Case figured it out when we landed. 
Brand looks down. 
BRAND I thought... I couldn't be sure. 
COOPER Sure you could. You're brilliant. You know everything. 
BRAND Cooper... we needed to keep going. I'm so sorry. Your children... 
COOPER They're not children any more... if they're even still alive. 
He turns away from her. 
BRAND Listen, the important thing is that we're going home, now. And we have something that can save everyone. It's more important than the people we left behind- 
Doyle cuts her off, filled with anger. 
DOYLE That's easy for you to say. You didn't leave anyone behind. 
Cooper looks at Brand, his anger softened by sadness. 
COOPER Yes she did. 
Brand looks at him, grateful for this small kindness. 
COOPER (CONT'D) That's why you were upset -- your father. 
She looks down, filled with sadness. 
BRAND He's gone. But there are other people who still need our help. There's still time... 
The ship's controls TONE in ALARM. Brand and Cooper turn: 
Case is standing at the controls. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Case... what are you doing? 
Case finishes typing in a sequence on the command controls. Presses the "execute" button. 
The last nuclear engine begins to detach from the ship. 
BRAND (CONT'D) Wait... no... 
The robot turns from them. Cooper notices that the control module snapped into the back of Case's chassis is wrong: 
It's red with a gold star. It's not Case at all. It's Liu. 
LIU I'm sorry. I have my orders. No one follows... 
Liu stares, satisfied, as the nuclear engine spins away from the ship and back down toward Pantagruel. 
Cooper SMASHES Liu from behind. The robot tumbles to the ground, the fight gone out of him. 
Cooper and Doyle roll the robot over and Cooper reaches for his control module. 
LIU (CONT'D) No one follows- 
Cooper rips the module out. The robot freezes. 
Brand is already at the controls, trying to regain control. 
The instruments TONE, alerting the crew to their position: 
The ship is spinning back down towards the black hole. 
BRAND No... We're being pulled back to Pantagruel. 
Cooper, frantically checks the controls, firing the remaining boosters. 
COOPER We can't let that happen. We'll lose more time... too much... 
The boosters are no match for the deadly pull of the black hole below them. 
On the ship's guidance, they watch, helpless, as the ship climbs back up the volcano rim towards the critical orbit. 
As on their first trip, the black hole grows to dominate the bottom of the sky, and the stars above them become streaks -- time is speeding for them as they are whirled down into the deep gravity well around the hole. 
As they watch, trapped, decades begin to play out in the system above them. They watch as the ice planet whirls around them, orbiting the black hole dozens of times. 
COOPER (CONT'D) We're losing years. 
Finally, the ice planet plunges past them towards destruction. As it reaches it slows, until finally it reaches the event horizon, just as they saw in the projections. Nothing has prepared them for the reality: 
The ice planet is SMASHED apart with stunning violence. 
Brand looks at the sample of fractal life. Now they are united -- they are, in all likelihood, the sole survivors of their planet. 
Doyle points to the instruments. 
DOYLE The wormhole. Look -- it's being pulled into the black hole as well. 
They watch on the holographic model as the wormhole's orbit converges on the event horizon of the black hole. 
BRAND It's orbit mirrored the ice planet's. 
COOPER What will happen to it? 
BRAND It'll be destroyed, like everything else. 
Cooper struggles to pull himself over to the communications screen. Sets it to make a shortwave broadcast. Brand opens her mouth to point out that it's futile, then stops. 
COOPER (INTO RADIO) This is the crew of the Endurance. We... (gives up on FORMALITIES) Murph, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I didn't make it back, like I promised. 
He hangs up the radio. 
In silence, they watch as the wormhole -- their only way home -- vanishes beneath the event horizon. 
DOYLE How much time are we losing? 
BRAND (HEARTBROKEN) Decades...hundreds of years.

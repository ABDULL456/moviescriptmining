MAX The pizza, of course. The paramedics took 35 minutes to arrive. 
STACY I can't believe you! Did you get in trouble? 
MAX The Station Manager said I couldn't go on the air ever again. 
STACY So what'd you do?! 
MAX I gave him the pizza! 
They collapse on the bed, laughing. Stacy rolls over and kisses Max on the lips. His eyes go wide and he frantically crawls backwards. 
STACY What? Don't you like me? 
MAX It would never work. 
STACY How would you know? 
MAX I know. I have a sixth sense. 
STACY You see dead people? 
MAX I see dead relationships. 
Stacy sits up, frustrated, the mood ruined. 
MAX (CONT'D) (TO CAMERA) That was all true, but there was something else, though. I mean, there I was, drunk, in a girl's bedroom, and the only thought running through my mind was... 
12 EXT. CAMPUS QUAD ­ DAY ­ FLASHBACK 12 
Max speaks to someone O.S. 
MAX ..."What about Beth?" 
Max is talking to Beth. It's a beautiful Spring day. 
MAX (CONT'D) I mean, I know we're just friends, but you really mean a lot to me and we've been spending a lot of time together lately, and maybe... I guess what I'm saying is, maybe we could try going out on a date or something? 
BETH Max... 
MAX I mean, it wouldn't have to be, uh... 
BETH Sure. 
MAX We wouldn't have to... What? 
BETH I'd love to. How's tomorrow night? 
MAX Um, yeah, it would have to be after, or maybe... Yeah, tomorrow, uh, tomorrow night's fine. 
BETH Great. I know the perfect thing. 
She splits, leaving Max befuddled at his change of fortune. 
13 EXT. LIBRARY -- NIGHT 13 
Max and Beth are walking through the night in overcoats. 
BETH Never? 
MAX Not until Sam and Jen. 
BETH A perfect record. Wow. 
MAX I don't get what the fuss is. I knew you and that Chris guy wouldn't last a week as soon as I saw you together. 
BETH But you can tell with everybody? I don't know if that's sad or incredible. 
MAX Or incredibly sad. I'm amazed I'm the only one who can tell. Take any couple. If it's not incompatible lifestyles, it's conflicting priorities. If it's not that, it's usually clashing levels of self- esteem. It's always something. 
BETH Living with you would be a nightmare. I'd be afraid to bring any boyfriends home. Oh, uh, sorry. 
Awkward pause. 
MAX Well, just because I see it, doesn't mean I talk about it. I don't say a word to my suitemates. 
BETH You guys never talk about anything important anyway. 
MAX Oh, come on, we have philosophical discussions all the time. 
BETH Like whether Voltron could kill the Transformers?

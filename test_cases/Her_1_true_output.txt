SEXYKITTEN (fully into it) The dead cat next to the bed. Choke me with it! 
Beat. He's taken out of it. 
THEODORE (uncomfortable, trying to play along) Um, okay. 
SEXYKITTEN Tell me. 
THEODORE I'm choking you with the cat. 
SEXYKITTEN TELL ME! Keep telling me! 
THEODORE I've got it's tail and I'm choking you with the cat's tail. 
SEXYKITTEN YEAH, YOU ARE! FUCK! TELL ME! 
THEODORE I'm choking you and it's tail is around your neck. It's so tight around your neck. 
SEXYKITTEN YES! YES! 
Theodore doesn't know what to say. He doesn't want to offend her. 
THEODORE I'm pulling it. I'm pulling it. The cat's dead. It's a dead cat around your neck and I'm pulling it. 
SEXYKITTEN AHHHHHHHHHHHH. OH MY GOD! 
Her breathing is slowing down. 
SEXYKITTEN (CONT'D) Oh god, I came so hard.

THEODORE Yeah. Me too. 
SEXYKITTEN Okay, good night. 
Theodore takes his earpiece out and stares at the ceiling. 
INT. SUBWAY STATION - MORNING 
Theodore exits the train, walks through the station full of commuters, gets on a moving platform. Going through a tunnel, the walls are hundred foot long screens advertising a new product. He notices people stopped, watching the ad. We hear soft, new age, uplifting electronica music in the background, while a comforting, sincere, older man's voice speaks to us. 
SOULFUL OLDER MALE VOICE We ask you a simple question. Who are you? What can you be? Where are you going? What's out there? What are the possibilities? Elements Software is proud to introduce the first artificially intelligent operating system. 
Close on Theodore listening intently. 
SOULFUL OLDER MALE VOICE (CONT'D) An intuitive entity that listens to you, understands you, and knows you. It's not just an operating system, it's a consciousness. Introducing OS ONE - a life changing experience, creating new possibilities. 
The ad starts over. Theodore steps off the moving walkway and stops to watch the ad again, deeply captivated. 
INT. THEODORE'S HOME OFFICE - NIGHT 
Theodore sits at his desk that houses a futuristic, large screen computer monitor. The OS box is open, with warranties and paperwork spilling out. He's leafing through the papers. He glances at his monitor, it says: Installation 98% complete. A chime brings his attention back to the screen: Installation Complete.

TEXT VOICE Mr. Theodore Twombly, welcome to the world's first artificially intelligent operating system, OS ONE. We'd like to ask you a few basic questions before the operating system is initiated. This will help create an OS to best fit your needs. 
THEODORE Okay. 
TEXT VOICE Are you social or anti-social? 
THEODORE I haven't been social in awhile, really because...

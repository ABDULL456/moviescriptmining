SAM (unseen) Here! 
A Sudden Noise...Sam pops up from behind a Bush! 
SAM (CONT'D) Mr. Frodo's not gong anywhere without me. 
ELROND No, Indeed...it is hardly possible to separate you...even when he is summoned to a secret council and you are not. 
Merry and Pippin jump up from behind another bush! 
MERRY Oi! We're coming too! You'll have to send us home tied up in a sack to stop us. 
PIPPIN Anyway...you need people of intelligence on this sort of mission...quest...thing... 
MERRY Well, that rules you out, Pip. 
ELROND SURVEYS THE GROUP 
ELROND (thoughtfully) Nine companions ... so be it. (announcing) You shall be the "Fellowship of the ring" 
PIPPIN Great.   Where are we going? 
CUT TO: 
INT. FRODO'S BEDROOM, RIVERDELL---DAWN 
Close on: An old sword sliding out of a shabby leather Scabbard...its polished, well tendered Blade glitters cold and bright. 
BILBO My old sword "Sting"...here, take it! 
Bilbo offers Sting to Frodo. 
FRODO It's so light! 
BILBO Yes, yes, made by the Elves, you know. The blade glows blue when Orcs are close...and it's times like that, my lad, when you have to be extra careful. 
Bilbo unwraps a small shirt of close woven Mail. 
BILBO (CONT'D) Here's a pretty thing. Mithril, as light as a feather, and as hard as dragon scales. Let me see you put it on. Come on. 
CLOSE ON: Frodo peels off his shirt... revealing The Ring on the Chain around his neck. 
BILBO (CONT'D) (entranced) Oh! My old Ring... Frodo frowns as Bilbo moves toward him. 
BILBO (CONT'D) I should very much like to hold it again, one last time. Bilbo reaches forward, eyes locked on the ring. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Suddenly! A shadow passes across Bilbo...for a split second he becomes a wrinkled creature with a hungry face and Bony, groping hands. Frodo pulls away, shocked...the shadow passes. Bilbo slumps into a chair, his head in his hands. Bilbo falters...his eyes filling with tears. 
BILBO (CONT'D) Oh! 
BILBO (CONT'D) (sad) I'm sorry, that I brought this upon you, my boy...I'm sorry that you must carry this burden. I'm sorry for everything. 
Bilbo sobs and Frodo moves to comfort him. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. RIVENDELL VALLEY -- MORNING 
ANGLE ON: 
The Fellowship climb the long steep path out of the cloven vale of Rivendell. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. ROUGH COUNTRY, SOUTH OF RIVENDELL -- DAY 
ANGLE ON: 
The fellowship trekking through a land of Deep Valleys and turbulent waters...the misty mountains rise sharply to their left. 
GANDALF (V.O.) We must hold to his course west of the misty Mountains for forty days. If our luck holds, the Gap of Rohan will still be open to us. From there, our road turns east, to Mordor. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. EREGION HILLS--DAWN 
CLOSE ON: Sam at the campfire. The sound of clashing swords! Wider: Aragorn and Boromir are giving Pippin Sword tuition... 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
BOROMIR Get away from the blade, Pippin...on your toes...good, very good...I want you to react, not think. 
SAM Should not be too hard... 
BOROMIR Move your feet.

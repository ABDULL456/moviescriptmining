BLANCHE giggles.  The two cars pull up before the garage and the people start to descend. 
INT. GARAGE APARTMENT.  DAY. 
A winded BUCK enters and puts down BLANCHE.  As others behind him carry in their things and disperse throughout apartment. 
BLANCHE Oh look, it's so clean, Buck.  And a Frigidaire...not an icebox! 
BUCK He give me the grocery number. 
He goes to the phone. 
BUCK (continuing) Lemme see, eh 4337...Operator... please ma'm, may I have 4337...if you please? 
BLANCHE Oh...they got linoleum on the counter.  Ain't that clever! 
BUCK Hello, Smitty's grocery...I'd like to order a mess of groceries.  Oh yeah...eh 143 Hillsdale Street. Lessee, about 8 pounds of porkchops, 4 pounds of red beans...a can of Chase and Sandborn...uh. 
BLANCHE Oh, isn't this something, Daddy! 
BUCK Sshh.  Uh...quart of milk...uh 8 bottles of Dr. Pepper and that's it, I guess.  No...no.  Uh...a box of Rice Krispies...Bye now. 
CUT TO: 
INT. LIVING ROOM.  DAY. 
Open on BONNIE and CLYDE.  He is cleaning guns.  She is watching something off screen.  We hear a clicking sound. 
BLANCHE (O.S.) My, you need a haircut, Daddy.  You look like a hillbilly boy. 
A look of disgust crosses BONNIE's face.  CLYDE, who has been watching her, smiles.  The clicking sound increases suddenly. 
BUCK (O.S.) Gotcha! 
BLANCHE whoops.  Camera cuts to see that BUCK and C.W. are playing checkers and BUCK has just beaten him. 
C.W. Again. 
BUCK Boy, you ain't never gonna beat me but you keep tryin' now. 
He starts to set up the game again. 
BLANCHE Jest like an ol' man.  Plays checkers all the time and doesn't pay any attention to his poor lonely wife. 
She ruffles his hair again. 
BUCK Cut it out now, honey.  I'm gonna teach this boy a lesson he'll never forget. 
Camera cuts to BONNIE, watching with disgust.  Then slowly, a wicked little smile edges across her face.  She watches for a moment more, then she rises and with the most ingenuous look she can muster up, beckons to CLYDE to follow her into the bedroom.  A little puzzled, CLYDE follows. 
INT. BEDROOM. 
BONNIE closes the door and immediately begins fussing with CLYDE's hair, doing a scathing imitation of BLANCHE.  Though her miming expresses her irritation at being closeted with the Barrow menage, it is also a peach doing an imitation of a lemon--and it is disarmingly sensual... Indeed the mimicry allows BONNIE to be physically freer with CLYDE, and allows CLYDE to respond without anxiety, without self-consciousness. We should have the distinct--if momentary--feeling that CLYDE could suddenly make it with BONNIE. 
BONNIE (doing an unmerciful imitation) Oh, Daddy, you shore need a haircut. You look just like a little old hillbilly boy, I do declare. (she has her other hand toying with the buttons on his shirt, her hand slipping under, fluttering across his bare chest) Oh mercy me, oh my stars! 
CLYDE laughs, and BONNIE tugs at the shirt--she kneels on the bed over CLYDE, who quite easily drapes across it. 
BONNIE (a little louder) Oh, Daddy!  Yore such a slowpoke! 
She's letting her hair fall loose, its golden ends brushing up and down CLYDE's body. 
CLYDE (amused, but cautionary) Hush up a little.  They're in the next room. 
BONNIE (a mock-pout, but with an edge to it) Shoot, there's always somebody in this room, the next room and ever' other kind of room. 
CLYDE has his arm around BONNIE, and she's almost draped across him--but in the direction of the length of the bed, so their bodies almost form a crooked cross.  She digs an elbow into his stomach. 
CLYDE Oof!...now that ain't no nice way to talk about my brother. 
BONNIE (imitating Blanche again with baby talk) I ain't talking about your brother. 
Suddenly BONNIE straightens up to a kneeling position again, and cocks her head.  When she speaks now it is with a simple plaintiveness. 
BONNIE Honey, do you ever just want to be alone with Me? (sensing Clyde's sensitivity to the sexual implication) I don't just mean like that...I mean do you ever have the notion of us bein' out together and alone, like at some fancy ball, or, I don't know, where we walk in all dressed and they announce us and it's fancy and in public, but we're alone somehow.  We're separate from everybody else, and they know it.

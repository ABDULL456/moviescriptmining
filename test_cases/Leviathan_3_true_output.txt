Halogen lights illuminate bits and pieces of dredges and dumpsters squatting in the gloom.  A winch begins grinding and the big, newly hooked container lurches down the tracks. It comes to the end where a winch fits it into place with several others to complete a set.  We hear BECK'S VOICE. 
BECK/ RADIO Ok, that's it.  Come on in. 
More motor suited DIVERS appear, their helmet lights glaring.  Their breastplate names catch in the dim lights: COBS, BOWMAN, WILLIE. 
As they approach the UNDERWATER LOCK, where an elevator will transport them up into the Shack, we see signs of human life:  a basketball goal attached to the side of the building; stickers and signs:  "No Bozos," etc.  A formal sign towers over the entrance.  It says: TRANSOCEAN CORP. SHACK 6. 
ON ONE OF THE CREW 
He moves behind the others.  Suddenly he freezes in his tracks and slowly rotates his helmet--on his shoulder in the glare of his helmet beam WE SEE the a hideous looking SEA SPIDER.  It's thick legs moving eerily down his arm. 
Carefully, so as not to disturb the creature, a mechanical motor hand moves into position below it, and in one quick movement, snares it. 
CLOSE ON METAL WAIST POCKET.  The latch opens and the writhing sea spider is shoved inside.  From the pocket WE MOVE UP the diver's suit until we see the name SIXPACK on the breastplate.  He looks around to see if anyone has noticed then continues on toward the shack. 
ON TWO DIVERS(JONES AND DEJESUS) 
They walk together to the Shack.  A Latino VOICE, DEJESUS, comes over the radio singing an old Miller Beer jingle in an exaggerated accent. 
DEJESUS When it's time to relax.... One thing stands clear... 
INSIDE ON BECK 
As he listens to the singing over the tinny speaker, we see he aches to be a part of their comaraderie, but is alienated by age and rank.  He is the shack boss, management.  He listens as a BOOMING BLACK VOICE joins in off-key. 
JONES' VOICE(O.C.) Mil-ler's tastes too good to hurry through... 
As the singing continues, Beck looks over at an empty chair in front of a bank of equipment monitors.  The vital signs of each miner and his equipment are registered on this console.  The chair in front of them sits conspicuously empty.  This doesn't please Beck, neither does a hand written sign under the console which states:  THE DOCTOR IS OUT. 
DEJESUS' POV 
Inside his helmet we see the grid of LED gauges monitoring vital signs. 
DEJESUS ...beer after beer... 
Suddenly a red warning light begins blinking in the bottom corner inside DeJesus' helmet.  The words to the song freeze in his mouth.  His voice becomes edged with panic. 
DEJESUS(cont'd) Oh, shit... 
JONES/ RADIO (to DeJesus) Hey, Hazy, I'm not that bad, man. 
DEJESUS (rising terror) Jonesy!  I'm losing compression... I'm going to blow my suit, man! Beck!  Doc!  Help me!... 
INSIDE 
Beck grabs his microphone.  He tries to remain calm but there is a definite tremble in his voice. 
BECK Give me a readout, DeJesus. 
DEJESUS(ON RADIO) (gripped with panic) Ahhhh! 
OUTSIDE 
The other divers move quickly to DeJesus. 
BECK (ON RADIO) DeJesus!  A readout! 
JONES He don't need a readout, man, he needs help! 
BECK(RADIO) (anything but calm) Stay calm! 
BOWMAN Calm!?  Where's Doc? 
INSIDE 
Beck stands in front of the equipment monitors, lost. 
BECK (trying to keep control) The internal monitors read normal. 
ON THE MINERS, PANICKED

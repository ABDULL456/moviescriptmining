MARTIN Your independence is dependant on advertisers - if we're being honest. However much you think that is, you'd retain. We don't care about content. 
Blomkvist suddenly feels like someone coming late to a party. 
BLOMKVIST Excuse me.   Did I miss something? VANGER We're talking about an investment in the magazine. BLOMKVIST I gather.    Why would you want to do that? 
MARTIN Not for the return, that's for sure. 
VANGER (to Erika) I feel bad that I've take Mikael away from you at the worst possible time. This is the right thing to do. The moral thing. That's one reason. 
ERIKA And. VANGER The enemies of my friends are my enemies. I hate Wennerstrom as much as you hate what he's done to you. Silence. 
VANGER So what do you say? 
Erika half-shrugs to say she'll consider it. 
VANGER Is that a maybe? She nods. 
VANGER Wonderful!   More wine, Anna. 
Blomkvist looks at Erika, but she glances away to Vanger. 
VANGER I think Mikael is adapting well to rustic life, by the way. ERIKA Have you seen him try to make a fire? 
VANGER Put the logs on end, like this. 
He makes a teepee shape with his hands, like praying. 109   INT. COTTAGE - LATER - NIGHT                                109 
Erika lights a teepee of logs in the fireplace. BLOMKVIST How long have you been discussing this with them? ERIKA I haven't been. They asked me to come up yesterday.

The TV Cameraman ZOOMS and the TV image ZEROES IN through the door to show a partially-screened but quite clear image of Sonny, talking to Sal. 
SONNY (to Sal) The whole media is out there... it looks a lot better for us than it did before... 
ON SAL 
absorbing this... 
TV NEWSMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) We can see the robbers inside the bank, and we're trying now to establish contact. 
THE PHONE BEGINS TO RING. 
TV NEWSMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) We're on the telephone to the bank manager, Patrick J. Mulvaney... Mister Mulvaney... 
Mulvaney answers the phone. 
MULVANEY'S VOICE (V.O.) Yes, I can hear you. 
SONNY 
serious, nodding to Sal. 
TV NEWSMAN'S VOICE (V.O.) Can you put the robber on the phone? Will he talk to us? 
MULVANEY'S VOICE (V.O.) You wanna talk to him... Sonny... 
Sonny turns, trying to understand... 
NEW ANGLE 
SONNY What? 
MULVANEY The TV... they want to talk to you... 
He holds out the phone.  Sonny walks over to him and takes the receiver.  On the TV screen, we can see him doing this. 
SONNY (into phone) Yeah?  Who's this? 
WABC TV NEWSMAN Sir, you're on the air.  I wonder if you'd answer a few questions. 
SONNY (to Sal) Hey, Sal... (to phone) Sure. 
TV NEWSMAN Why are you doing this? 
SONNY Doing what? 
TV NEWSMAN Robbing a bank. 
SONNY I don't know... It's where they got the money.  I mean, if you want to steal, you go to where they got the money, right? 
Jenny now edges over and sits on top of Edna's desk. 
TV NEWSMAN But I mean, why do you need to steal? Couldn't you get a job? 
SONNY Get a job doing what?  You gotta be a member of a union, no union card - no job.  To join the union, you gotta get the job, but you don't get the job without the card. 
TV NEWSMAN What about, ah, non-union occupations? 
SONNY Like what?  Bank teller?  What do they get paid - (now looks over at girls who offer the information - $135.37) they pay one hundred thirty-five dollars and thirty-seven cents to start.  I got a wife and kids.  I can't live on that -- You want to live on that?  What do you make a week? 
TV NEWSMAN (swiftly, evasive) I'm here to talk to you, Sonny, not... 
SONNY Wait a minute... I'm talkin' to you. I'm askin' you a question... 
TV NEWSMAN The audience is interested in you, Sonny... not me. 
SONNY Yeah!  We're hot entertainment, right? You got me and Sal on TV...  we're entertainment you sell, right? 
TV NEWSMAN You're news, Sonny... 
SONNY How much you have to pay an entertainer to fill this slot? 
TV NEWSMAN Newsman, not... 
SONNY Okay, newsman.  How much you make a week? (beat) You're not talkin'.  You payin' me? What have you got for me?  We're givin' you entertainment... what are you givin' us? 
TV NEWSMAN What do you want us to give you? You want to be paid for... 
SONNY I don't want to be paid.  I'm here with Sal and eight other people... and we're dyin'!  They're gonna blow our guts out, man!  You're gonna see our brains onna sidewalk!  How's that for all you shut-ins and housewives to look at!  You gonna help, or you just put it on instead of AS THE WORLD TURNS?  We're dyin' here!  What have you got for me? 
TV NEWSMAN You could give up. 
SONNY Oh yeah?  Give up?  You ever been in prison? 
TV NEWSMAN Of course not... 
SONNY Then talk about somethin' you fuckin' know about... 
At that instant, the TV screen switches to a PLEASE STAND BY card and we hear an announcer's voice over:

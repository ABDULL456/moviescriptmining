A FOOTMAN announces: TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                    65. 
FOOTMAN Their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York. 
Wallis sweeps forward to greet them, but Elizabeth sails past, announcing to no one in particular: 
ELIZABETH I came at the invitation of the King. 
David turns and bows formally. Elizabeth cursties in return. Wallis quickly returns to David, taking him forcefully onto the dance floor. The Yorks go in the other direction. 
To the side, Churchill and Lang watch David and Wallis do a brisk Turkey Trot. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL According to the F.B.I.... she is, after all, one of their citizens...our Monarch does not possess exclusive rights to Mrs. Simpson's sexual favours. Hitler's Ambassador, Count von Ribbentrop, has been sending her 17 carnations every day...one for each time they've slept together. 
COSMO LANG Good Lord, Winston, we must see to it this Empress of the Night does not become Queen of England! 
WINSTON CHURCHILL Vividly put. 
Churchill has spotted Elizabeth in a side room. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D) Allow me to test new waters.

Churchill makes his way to Elizabeth, who is standing in front of a portrait of George IV. 
ELIZABETH I don't need to be told I behaved badly. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL On the contrary, Mam. Court etiquette decrees royalty must be greeted by the official host. In this case: the King. You behaved impeccably. As always. (MORE) TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   66. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL (CONT'D) (referring to the painting) A relative? 
ELIZABETH Distant. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL (referring again to the painting) You're well aware, of course, George IV's wife, Mrs. Fitzherbert, was very common indeed...and previously married. She signed an agreement that she could never become Queen, and their children could not be Royal. A rather sensible morganatic arrangement. 
ELIZABETH That was   a very long time ago. You're stirring   with a rather large spoon, Winston.   Keep in mind, I'm also a distant relative   of Lady Macbeth. 
WINSTON CHURCHILL I would disremember at my peril. 
David is coming briskly down the corridor, struggling to open a champagne bottle, followed by Bertie determined to catch up. 
Elizabeth and Churchill leave the brothers alone. 
BERTIE David... 
DAVID Wally wants more champagne. I have to fetch it. She prefers that. 
BERTIE Been trying to see you... 
DAVID Been terribly busy. 
BERTIE Doing what? 
DAVID Being King. TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   67. 
BERTIE Where did you get that American accent? David...Father's not dead six months, yet you've put Mrs. Simpson in the suite used by our mother? 
DAVID Mama's not still in bed, is she? 
BERTIE That isn't funny. 
DAVID Ssssssorry, d-d-dear b-b-oy! 
BERTIE Please. No more of that. 
A moment of silent confrontation. David backs down. Sort of. 
DAVID Didn't realize you cared. 
BERTIE This could end in disaster. 
DAVID This will end splendidly. With Wallis as my wife. 
BERTIE Whatever will she call herself? 
DAVID Queen of England, I suspect. Kings do marry. Empress of India. The whole bag of tricks. 
BERTIE David! The upper classes are terrified anything which clouds the monarchy makes their situation more dangerous. Hunger marchers are singing the "Red Flag" in front of Westminster...demanding a republic...I've seen them... 
DAVID Herr Hitler will sort that out. 
BERTIE Who'll sort out Chancellor Hitler? TKS/Seidler/09/17/08                                   68.

SHORT ROUND Indy, they glow like fire and get real crazy!  Then he talk in this real scary voice! 
Indy tousles Short Round's hair. 
INDIANA He was afraid of you.  He knows a tough  guy when he sees one. 
SHORT ROUND (not so shure) Yeah, that's what happened... 
They reach their room and Short Round opens the door. 
INDIANA I better see how Willie is. 
Short Round shakes his head scornfully as Indy crosses the hall and knocks on another door.  After a moment, the door opens and Willie is standing there in a tempting nightgown. 
INDIANA I brought you something. 
He holds up something wrapped in a piece of silk. 
WILLIE (disgusted) Not leftovers? 
INDIANA No -- real food. 
Willie opens the bundle suspiciously -- then her hace lights up as she examines the breads and fruits inside. 
WILLIE Oh, it is real food...it's beautiful. 
She bites happily into a piece of fruit -- its juice runs down her chin and Indy wipes it off gently with his hand.  The mouth deliberately seductive and Willie is not displeased. 
WILLIE (Cont'd) You're nice.  Listen, I'm taking applications -- how'd you like to be my palace slave? 
INDIANA (smiling) Wearing your jewels to be, prin- cess? 
Indy touches her necklace -- then his hand caresses her neck and ear.  She shivers slightly and speaks softly. 
WILLIE Yeah -- and nothing else. (smiling) That shock you? 
INDIANA (shaking his head) I'm a scientist.  I like doing research on certain "nocturnal activities" -- 
She smiles and puts a grape to his lips.  He opens his mouth takes it and chews it. 
WILLIE You mean like love rituals... 
He swallows the grape and they move toward each other slowly to kiss, revealing the passion that's simmering. 
INDIANA And mating customs... 
They kiss again more heatedly. 
WILLIE Primitive sexual practices? 
INDIANA You're taling to an authority in that area. 
They kiss again hungrily -- 
WILLIE You're dying to come into my room, aren't you? 
INDIANA You want me so bad, why don't you invite me? 
WILLIE Too proud to admit you're crazy about me, Dr. Jones? 
INDIANA I think you're too used to get- ting you own way, Willie... 
They kiss yet again -- and Indy breaks it off, just to show he's still in control.  He backs away toward his room. 
WILLIE (watching him) We'll see who gives in first -- I'll leave my door open. 
INDIANA Don't catch cold. 
WILLIE Dr. Jones -- ? 
Indy stops by his door and sees Willie smiling as she holds up five fingers -- 
WILLIE (Cont'd) Five minutes... you'll be back over here in five minutes... 
INDIANA You're dreaming, Willie.  You want to make it real, just knock on my door. 
He winks.  She waves.  But neither one will surrender first. Willie does into her room, leaving the door ajar.  Indy opens his door. 
65.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                          65. 
Indy comes in and closes the door -- leaving it open a crack.  He stands and listens, waiting for her to come over. 
66.    INT.  WILLIE'S SUITE                                           66. 
Willie stands likewise by her door, waiting to hear Indy come back over. 
67.    INT.  INDIANA'S SUITE                                           67. 
Indiana shrugs and walks over to a couch and starts taking off his tweed jacket and necktie -- 
INDIANA Five minutes... fat chance. 
68.    INT.  WILLIE SUIT                                              68.

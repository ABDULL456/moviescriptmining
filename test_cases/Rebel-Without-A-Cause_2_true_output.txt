The slam of a door is heard below. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
JIM's garage.  Night.  JUDY waiting inside.  JIM's car pulls in, a radio going softly.  He turns the motor off and is about to turn off the radio when we hear the announcer: 
ANNOUNCER Coming up now another request--this time from the boys down at Anna's Pizza Paradise--A new arrangement of a great oldie in rhythm and blues.  Jim, this is dedicated to you--from Buzz. 
JIM stares at the radio, then turns it off. 
Another angle. 
JUDY They'll be looking for you. 
JIM They saw where I jumped!  I didn't chicken!  What do I have to do-- kill myself? 
JUDY It doesn't matter to them. 
JIM You were looking for me, weren't you? 
JUDY (a small voice) No--I was just--maybe-- 
JIM I tried to call you before. JUDY I thought so. 
JIM Want some milk? 
JUDY comes forward. 
JIM That's all I can do when I'm nervous.  Drink milk.  Here--have a slug. 
She shakes her head.  He takes a sip. 
JIM You still pretty upset? 
JUDY I'm numb. 
She is shuddering a little. 
JIM You cold? 
JUDY Even if I'm near a fire, I'm cold. I guess just about everybody's cold. 
JIM I swear, sometimes, you just want to hold onto somebody!  Judy, what am I going to do?  I can't go home again. 
JUDY Neither can I. 
JIM No?  Why not? (no answer) You know something?  Sometimes I figure I'll never live to see my next birthday.  Isn't that dumb? 
JUDY No. 
JIM Every day I look in the mirror and say, "What?  You still here?" Man! 
They laugh a little. 
JIM Hey!  You smiled! 
JUDY shakes her head--beginning to warm to him. 
JIM Like even today.  I woke up this morning, you know?  And the sun was shining and everything was nice. Then the first thing that happens is I see you and I thought this is going to be one terrific day so you better live it up, boy, 'cause tomorrow maybe you'll be nothing. 
JUDY I'm sorry I treated you mean today. You shouldn't believe what I say when I'm with the kids.  Nobody acts sincere. 
JIM Why'd you get mixed up with them? You don't have to prove anything. 
JUDY If you knew me you wouldn't say that. 
JIM I don't think you trust anybody, do you? 
JUDY Why? 
JIM I'm getting that way, too. 
JUDY (looks at him) Have you ever gone with anyone who-- 
JIM Sure.  Lots of times.

Kevin heading quickly away from the courtroom.     Gettys right on his heels. 
KEVIN Lloyd, as your attorney, I'm advising you to get the fuck away from me. 
GETTYS Why?   What are you talking about? 
KEVIN The wife. The kid. The outrage. You definitely had me fooled. 
GETTYS You're my lawyer! You're here to defend me! 
KEVIN You know what I'm thinking? Why don't we put you on the stand and you can jerk off for the judge. 
GETTYS You know she's lying. 
KEVIN Get the hell out of my way. 
Gettys standing aside, as we --

An ancient upstairs facility. Kevin standing at the mirror. Frozen there. Identity crisis. Morality crisis. He takes off his wedding ring. Letting cold water run in the sink. His eyes never leaving the mirror. (CONTINUED)

Behind him, the door opens.     A local REPORTER enters, moves to the urinal. 
REPORTER Well, hell, there you are. Rumor was you were out wandering in traffic. 
KEVIN Not now, Larry. 
REPORTER What's the game plan, Kevin? I got a four-thirty deadline. I need a quote. Gimme a quote. 
KEVIN Fuck off. 
REPORTER 'Mr. Lomax had no comment on today's events. Speculation, however, was widespread that the young lawyer's unblemished string of victories would come to an end in this courtroom.' 
Kevin pulls some cold water to his face. Startled, as THUNDER EXPLODES overhead -- then just as suddenly, becomes nothing more than the urinal flushing... 
REPORTER It was a nice run, Kev. Had to close out someday. Nobody wins 'em all. 
The Reporter exits.      Kevin alone with the mirror. 
And then it's over. 
He's made his decision. Replacing his wedding ring. Reaching for his jacket, as we --

Barbara on the stand.   Everyone in place. 
KEVIN Math hasn't exactly been your subject this year, has it? 
BARBARA No. 
KEVIN Any theories on why you've done so poorly in math this year? 
BARBARA It's not my fault. 
KEVIN Would you say Mr. Gettys is the problem? (as she shrugs) You're not sure. Have you had any discipline problems in math class this year? 
BARBARA No. 
KEVIN No? Isn't it true Mr. Gettys has had to talk to you repeatedly about your behavior? Isn't that why he asked you to stay after class? 
BARBARA No. 
KEVIN Have other teachers ever asked you to stay after class? 
BARBARA Once or twice. 
KEVIN Did they want to talk about your behavior? 
PROSECUTOR Objection.    Immaterial. 
KEVIN Goes to motive.

JUDGE Overruled.    You may answer the question. 
BARBARA I don't know what the other teachers wanted. You'd have to talk to them. 
KEVIN You ever pass notes in class, Barbara? Maybe a note that made fun of Mr. Gettys? 
BARBARA No. 
KEVIN No? Never called him a 'disgusting pig monster'? 
BARBARA No. 
Kevin handing out paperwork. 
KEVIN Your Honor, I've pre-marked this Defense Exhibit A...

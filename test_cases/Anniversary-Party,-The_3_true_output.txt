MONICA I left the gate open and Otis got out! He could get hit by a car! 
RYAN God willing. 
MONICA We have to find the dog, Ryan. 
RYAN Why? 
MONICA (regards him) Because we're nice people, and because what goes around comes around. (desperate) Because, God help you if something happens to that dog? 
RYAN Excuse me? 
MONICA All the ugly phone calls?  We're not the only people with a tape recorder, Ryan. (a beat) They've gone to the canyon, we should go towards the PCH. 
EXT. CANYON - MOMENTS LATER 
Panes and Skye search the canyon for Otis.  They both carry lanterns. 
PANES Otis!!  Shostakovich identified with the Jew.  He felt persecuted, hunted, crushed under the thumb of Stalinist imperialism. 
SKYE Not to mention Andrew Zhdanov... Otis, come!! 
PANES Andre Zhdanov?  How the hell do you know about Andre Zhdanov? 
SKYE Who doesn't know about the infamous composer's conference of 1948 where Zhdanov persecuted the leaders of Soviet Music - Shostakovich, Prokofieve, and Myaskovsky. 
PANES I'll tell you who doesn't know, cute girls don't know. 
SKYE Do Peter Sellers again. 
PANES (a la Sellers) Otis you crazy dog!  Otis are you in this God forsaken Canyon?  My people are very hungry. 
SKYE I just did a movie about Bob Yar, I played Gittle, the Jewish milkmaid who gets shot in the head, and they used Shostakovich's 13th Symphony. 
PANES Set to the poem of Yetveshenko! 
SKYE Exactly!  So I dug it, and I did a lot of research. 
PANES Do you really, you really, like Shostakovich? 
SKYE Yeah. 
PANES Would you, like, marry him? 
SKYE If he were still alive, maybe. 
PANES How about someone who really really liked Shostakovich? 
SKYE (smiling) Are you asking me to marry you? 
PANES No, I'm just testing to see how deeply perverted and impulsive you are. 
SKYE (laughing) Very. 
PANES Oh good, I'm worse... Are you really twenty-two? 
SKYE Who told you that?  No.  I'm twenty... (lops off two years) Five. 
EXT. CANYON - CONTINUOUS 
Sally and Joe have lanterns.  Panes and Skye are up ahead. We hear them calling for Otis. 
SALLY Otis!!!! 
JOE (on her heels) Otis!!!! 
SALLY Otis, good boy, come here.  Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god. 
JOE This is a nightmare.  We should have kept him upstairs. 
SALLY It was done.  When Sophia put the kids to bed, America brought Otis in the room and closed the door.  It was done. 
JOE Well someone clearly let him out before Monica opened the gate.

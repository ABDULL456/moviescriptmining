Randy: So were planning our next vacation right. I want Australia, she wants Italy. I like snorkelling. She likes garlic. All of a sudden, out of nowhere, she says to me do I need her? Jesus Benny, what kind of question is that? I mean need, what does it mean to really need somebody? 
Eric: Benny, fuel line. 
Benny: Hey Waldo, could you answer that phone? 
Waldo: Yeah, Hello? 
Postman: I need a check Benny, C.O.D.

In the garage office 
Benny: (On phone) all right, the issue is jelly, you only like two kinds. You either like grape or poison berry, which? All right. Yeah, yeah peanut butter, I know, super kind, all right, see you at 6. Ok, bye.(Hangs up phone) Hi, thanks for waiting mam. Erm, im afraid that the best deal we can do for you is going to be, erm, $7750. But I think if you check around youll see that that is a really good deal. 
Girl: Yeah?

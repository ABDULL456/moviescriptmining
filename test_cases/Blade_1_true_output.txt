Blade tears himself from Karen, his pulse racing as -- 
CUT TO: 
INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT 
-- the invocation of LaMagra reaches critical mass. Frost is consumed by a hellish force, unable to withstand the onslaught of spirit energy any longer. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ANTECHAMBER - NIGHT 
-- Karen clawing at Blade, tears streaming down her cheeks. 
KAREN Don't stop -- 
But Blade grips her by her shoulders, shoving her back. Karen stares at Blade, wide-eyed, as if waking from a trance. She touches the raw wounds on her neck, shaken -- 
KAREN My God -- 
Blade rises to his full height. His strength has more than returned, it's been doubled by the infusion of real blood. And there's something else in his gaze now too -- an animal fury that was missing before. Blade has taken one giant step closer to the darkness. 
KAREN (hesitant) Are you -- all right? 
Blade pulls at the chains manacled to his wrists, SNAPPING them apart like toys. He flexes his hands -- fingernails lengthening to tapered points. And he smiles, offering us a view of his canines, which have elongated into fangs. 
BLADE (near-demonic) Never been better. 
INT. TEMPLE SANCTUARY - NIGHT 
The aftermath. Smoke hangs heavy in the air, occluding the area where Frost had stood. As it dissipates, Mercury and the others creep forward, apprehensive -- 
MERCURY Deacon? 
FROST 
stands with his back to us, his body trailing wisps of occult fumes. As he slowly turns, we catch a glimpse of his eyes -- burning with an awesome, inner fire. 
FROST No longer. 
BLADE (O.S.) Frost!!! 
All heads turn -- 
BLADE 
stands at the balcony overhead, Karen at his side. He leaps from it, somersaulting down to the floor below, landing on his feet like a predatory cat. 
BLADE Who dies first? 
FROST (growling, to the others) Take him. 
Quinn GROWLS, stepping forward, armed with Blade's punching dagger. He offers his second "new hand" up for view. 
QUINN Grew another hand for you sweetmeat -- (tossing the dagger to his new hand) -- and now I'm gonna kill you with it. 
Quinn charges. Blade meets the vampire head-on, dropping into a low kick and sweeping the vampire's legs out from under him. He spins behind Quinn -- 
BLADE Let's see if you can grow a new one of these! 
Blade hooks a finger through the metal ring at the end of his jacket sleeve, pulling out a retractable strangle-wire which he twists around Quinn's throat. 
Blade tightens the wire, decapitating Quinn. The headless body staggers about, then drops to the cavern floor. Blade scoops up his punching dagger -- 
BLADE Next? 
Mercury and the other faithful vampires charge en masse. Blade launches a spinning wheel kick into the first vamp's face, SNAPPING its neck -- 
Mercury has Blade's .454 Casulls. She aims them at him -- 
MERCURY Have a taste of your own medicine! 
As she FIRES, Blade tucks and rolls, knocking one of the guns from her hand. The guns spins across the floor, where it's scooped up by -- 
KAREN, 
who takes aim at an approaching vamp, BLOWING it away.

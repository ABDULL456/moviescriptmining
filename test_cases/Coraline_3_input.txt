She turns to the witch and in the most confident tone she can muster, says: 
CORALINE I already know where you've hidden them. 
The Beldam turns from the fire, both concerned and sceptical. 
BELDAM Well... produce them. 
Coraline points to the little door. 
CORALINE They're behind that door. 
The Beldam leans close, knowing Coraline is wrong, and speaks very quietly. 
BELDAM Oh, they are, are they? 
A smile creeps onto her terrible face. And she STARTS TOWARDS THE LITTLE DOOR, moving in an odd, laboring way, as if she had four legs instead of two. She signals the armoire bug to stand aside, her back to Coraline. 
Coraline hears the soft chirp of her mother's finger on wet glass! Looks around, desperate - where is it coming from?! 
The cat's ears twitch and focus, and then he SEES SOMETHING on the mantel!. He whispers to Coraline -- 
CAT There! 
-- and JUMPS to land beside the DETROIT ZOO SNOW-GLOBE - 
OPAQUE WITH FROST. 
C.U. ON SNOW-GLOBE. With a SOFT-CHIRP, a section of glass is WIPED CLEAR from inside by a TINY FOREARM - and we see the tiny, cold figures that are CORALINE'S TRAPPED PARENTS! Coraline's heart races. She purposely stays back from them. 
CORALINE 
(WHISPERING) Mom.   Dad! 
ON BELDAM, by little door. Oblivious to Coraline's discovery, she COUGHS up the KEY into her hand. She turns to Coraline, expectantly. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) Go on.   Open it. They'll be there, all right. 
The Beldam stoops to push the key into the lock, turns it, leaves the key in place. 
She grins at Coraline and speaks in a low, sing-song voice. 
BELDAM You're wrong, Coraline! 
She opens the little door, revealing the empty, spider- web tunnel. 
ON CORALINE, who glances from the open door to the cat - obscured on the mantel - and back to the Beldam. She's thinking very hard. 
BELDAM (CONT'D) 
(PITYING) They aren't there. 
She opens her hands: one holds box with Coraline's BLACK BUTTON EYES, the other a THREADED NEEDLE. Triumphant, the Beldam softly gloats: 
BELDAM (CONT'D) Now you're going to stay here forever. 
Coraline strikes a warrior's pose, and, summons all the fury she can. 
CORALINE No ... I'm ... 
She GRABS THE CAT off the mantel and RAISES HIM OVER HER 
HEAD. 
CORALINE (CONT'D) 
NOT! 
And she HURLS THE CAT at the Beldam. The YOWLING ANIMAL - face shocked with surprise - SAILS through the air and lands RIGHT ON THE ASTONISHED WITCH'S HEAD. 
FREAKED-OUT, the cat DIGS in his CLAWS AND BITES the shrieking Beldam, who STAGGERS to one side of the little door. 
Coraline GRABS the SNOW GLOBE with her parents inside, stows it in her bag, and moves out to approach the door from the other side. 
The Beldam FLAILS WILDLY at the cat. The cat HOWLS LIKE A BANSHEE, RAISES HIS CLAWS, and - quick as you can - TWO 
SHINY BLACK BUTTONS HIT THE FLOOR - THE BELDAM'S EYES! 
ANGLE ON CAT as he's thrown on armoire bug. 
ON BELDAM, hands covering her face. 
BELDAM 
NOOOOOOOOO! 
Her hands pull away to show EMPTY, FLAT SOCKETS and TORN 
THREAD! 
BELDAM (CONT'D) You horrible cheating girl! 
She furiously STOMPS the floor which FLIES UP in a spiral of floorboards that drive Coraline to the room's center. A huge WEB TRAP LIES BENEATH THE FLOOR! 
The web trap STRETCHES DOWN into a FIFTY FOOT DEEP PIT. There is nothing beyond but PALE NOTHINGNESS.

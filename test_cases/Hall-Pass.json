Emma finishes putting on a rubberband, then looks at him, satisfied. \nEMMA There. You look pretty, Daddy. \nRICK Okay, now give me a kiss, hug and go to sleep. She lays back on her pillow. Rick gives her a big kiss on both cheeks. \nRICK (CONT'D) I love you, Emma. \nEMMA I love you, too, Daddy. \nEXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nRick (still in ponytails) tip-toes out of Emma's bedroom, closes the door so tly, then HUSTLES DOWN THE HALLWAY. \nF \nINT. RICK & MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRick scrambles into the room and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS. \nHIS POV - Maggie lays in bed, FAST ASLEEP. \nRICK No. Please, no. Rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep, so he just PULLS THE COVERS OVER HER SHOULDERS. As Rick walks around the bed and INTO THE BATHROOM in the b.g., we HOLD ON MAGGIE until she OPENS HER EYES. She listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge of GUILT, and when he shuts off the faucet, she CLOSES HER EYES AGAIN, and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARK - MORNING \nRick pushes Gunnar and Emma on the swings as a sweaty Fred APPROACHES carrying a tennis racket. (We see several TENNIS COURTS in the b.g.) \nFRED Hey. \nRICK Hey. How'd you make out? \nFRED Great. Lost both sets. \nRICK So'd you get the business? Fred nods and wipes his brow. \nFRED Pretty sure I got the Auto and Home. He told me to call his accountant on Monday about the Life. \nRICK Nice. Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with their CHILDREN. \nFRED Can you believe the talent here today? \nRICK \n(PAINED) Yeah. I know. They NOTICE something O.S.. THEIR POV - we see a SCANDINAVIAN AU PAIR bent over EXPOSING HER THONG UNDERWEAR as she picks up a CHILD from a wagon. \nFRED Ouch. \nRick SIGHS. \nRICK CPR girl's back, too. Rick nods toward A PIG-TAILED PARAMEDIC, early 30's, TEACHING A CPR CLASS. The two men look on solemnly. \nFRED Imagine if we were coming here back when we were single? \nRICK \n(FALSE BRAVADO) Oh baby, the damage we would do. \nEMMA Monkey bars! The kids JUMP off the swings and RUN for the jungle gym. \nGUNNAR Me first! Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor scooters and a basketball as Fred tags along. They shlep past THE TRI-DELTA SORORITY playing ultimate frisbee and \nWEARING 'JUICY' SWEATS. \nFRED So you get lucky last night? \nRICK Nah, the kids were up when we got home. How 'bout you? \nFRED Well, kinda lucky. Grace conked right out so I snuck out to the car and rubbed one out. Rick shoots Fred a look. \nRICK The car? What are you Knight Rider? Why didn't you just go in the bathroom like a normal guy? \nFRED And get caught by Grace? Can't risk it. Besides, cars turn me on--it's where I lost my virginity. And they're comfy--I just put the seat back and turn on the tunes. The guys sit on a bench. \nRICK That's one of the things they don't tell you when you're young--that you'll still be jerking-off after you get married. I thought it was dust gonna be a teenage thing. \nFRED Yeah, I didn't see that one coming. The two men sit in silence for a LONG BEAT as the Frisbee Girls play all around them. \nFRED (CONT'D) You know what I miss the most? \nRICK What? \nFRED The arch. \n", "test1_true": "FRED You know when you're taking a girl's panties off for the first time, and you're wondering if she's going to stop you, but then she gives you that little pelvic arch- thrust that tells you that the struggle's over, everything's going to be okay? Rick SIGHS. \nRICK That's a happy moment. \nFRED Yep. Another thing gone forever. Rick looks at his watch. \nRICK I should get going, I have to drop the kids off at a birthday party. \nFRED You want to grab a coffee after? \nCUT TO: \nESTABLISHING SHOT - COFFEE SHOP - LATER THAT MORNING \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - SAME \nFred and Rick stand in line. \nRICK Do you have any interest in going down to the Patriot's training camp one of these days? \nFRED Are you kidding, I'd love that. Except...I always feel kind of pathetic waiting in line for Tom Brady's autograph. \nRICK Fred, I was planning on bringing the kids. \nFRED Genius! That's the perfect cover! Rick shoots him a look then REACTS to something O.S. \nRICK Uh-oh... HIS POV - SLO-MO of a BEAUTIFUL GIRL walking toward him. Her straight brown hair shimmers.. .her blue eyes twinkle.. .her white uniformed blouse is unbuttoned enough to reveal a tasteful amount of CLEAVAGE. This is COFFEE GIRL, 23, granola, fresh, Australian, spacey. BACK ON THE GUYS staring in awe. \nFRED Did you see her face? Her face is tremendous. \nRICK (chanting, scared) Please don't have a nice ass, please don't have a nice ass... But as she turns to pour a cup of coffee, we see that HER ASS IS SPECTACULAR. Rick turns away, annoyed. \nRICK (CONT'D Oh, come on! That's ri iculous. \nFRED I know. She's from Australia. Been working here about a month. \nRICK Why'd you have to bring me here?! \nFRED Okay, cool it, tiger--here she comes. Coffee Girl steps up to the counter and smiles at Fred. \nCOFFEE GIRL \n(AUSTRALIAN ACCENT) Iced coffee with two Splendas again? Fred wants to say yes, but just nods. \nCOFFEE GIRL (CONT'D) How about your mate there? \nRICK \n(STUNNED) Uh...same. Her smile comes with a squint, which makes her eyes sparkle. \nANOTHER ANGLE reveals a WANNABE ARTIST-TYPE MALE EMPLOYEE, mid-20's (clearly covetous of Coffee Girl) sizing Rick and Fred up as he wipes down a counter. \nBACK ON COFFEE GIRL AND OUR GUYS \nCOFFEE GIRL (re: Rick's shirt) Hey, Old Navy, you like a muffin with that? \nRICK Uh, sure. What do you recommend? \nCOFFEE GIRL They're all good. The Wannabe Artist-Type steps protectively up beside Coffee Girl. \nWANNABE I'd go with the bran muffin--you guys are probably having digestive issues at your age, right? Rick flinches at this, then turns to Coffee Girl. \nRICK I'll have a blueberry muffin please. \nFRED Make it a bran muffin for me. Rick shoots Fred a look, clearly annoyed. As Coffee Girl turns to get their order, we go to... \nSAME SCENE - A FEW MINUTES LATER Rick and Fred, now with coffees, sit at the rear of the shop. \nRICK Did you notice she's from Cleavage, Ohio? \nFRED Yeah. I bet her areolas look like a couple of pepperoni slices. Fred trains his eyes back on Coffee Girl and SQUINTS \nINTENSELY. \nRICK What the hell are you doing? \nFRED Shh. I'm taking a mental photograph for my spank bank. \n(UNDER BREATH) Say cheese. \nED (O.S.) Jesus Christ, guys, give it a rest. \nRick and Fred turn to see ED LONG, tall, good-looking, mid- 40's, standing at the creamer counter behind them. \nRICK Oh, hey, Ed. Didn't see you there. \n", "test1_id": 1317, "test2_input": "Larry Bohac CHUCKLES and Grace shifts uncomfortably. \nGRACE Uh, maybe we should turn this off. But Ed turns THE VOLUME UP. CLOSE ON MONITOR - Rick plays along with a BAD BRITISH \nACCENT. \nRICK (ON MONITOR) Is that so, dear boy? And what happens if you lose power during a big blow and your main generator doesn't kick in? \nFRED (ON MONITOR) Well that's why I had the back-up generator installed in Kimmy's rumpus. Kimmy makes a face, shocked. \nGRACE (under breath; resigned) Here we go... \nINT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS \nRICK Hey, speaking of installations, is that a shiny new set of cans on Mandy Bohac? \nFRED Either that or she's wearing her daughter's t-shirt. \nINT. SAFE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCLOSE ON Mandy's surprised face. She looks at Larry, who's suddenly not so amused. \nINT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS \nRICK They look good but I'll still take the real deal any day. \nFRED Right. You're telling me you'd take Kimmy Long's flapjacks over Mandy's new speedbags? \nRICK That's what I'm telling you. I like boobs with a little mileage on 'em. They're more fun. \nFRED Fun? \nRICK Yeah. You can smoosh 'em, swing 'em, hump 'em, Stretch-Armstrong 'em. \nFRED And what about the proven correlation between floppy boobs and large-mouth vaginas? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. ED & KIMMY LONG'S ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER \nMaggie and Grace hurry down the front walk trailed by their shell-shocked husbands. A trembling and IRATE Kimmy is held back at the door by Ed and a couple other Guests. \nKIMMY You people are horrible! Horrible! \nED \n(CALLING OUT) I'm very disappointed, gentlemen! \nINT. MINI-VAN - DAY \nNo one speaks. Grace drives and Maggie sits beside her, humiliation etched across their faces. Finally: \nFRED Uh, anyone thinking chocolate chip cookie dough in a waffle cone? Grace YANKS the mini-van to the side of the road and GLARES \nBACK AT HIM. \nGRACE Large-mouth vaginas?! As the guys cower, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. RICK & MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRick looks small and weak sitting on the couch while Maggie stands across from him rubbing her temples. It looks like the Norman Rockwell painting where the mom reprimands her little boy for sneaking a frog into the house. \nMAGGIE You know what really troubles me? The thing that you're all so obsessed with is meaningless to you. It's really just about numbers with you guys. Rick looks up, confused. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Rick, you can't even tel me the month you lost your virginity. I can tell you the exact day and hour that I lost mine. Rick seems a little embarrassed by this. \nRICK Well, virginity is different for guys. \nMAGGIE The point is, obviously I like sex, too--it means something to me--but I don't walk around gawking at every guy I see. \nRICK All right, so I occasionally notice other women. I'm sorry. \nMAGGIE Occasionally? Rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come clean. \nRICK Okay, you want the truth? You really want me to pull back the curtain here? From the moment I leave the house in the morning 'til the moment I get home, I pretty much notice every woman in my path. Maggie turns to face him. \nRICK (CONT'D) But it's not how you think it is, Mags. It's like... it's like a curse. I don't want to notice, but I can't help it. It's always been like that. I figured that when I c jot married that would be it, but it wasn't--the thing,doesn't give two shits about marriage. \nMAGGIE \n(HURT) So what are you saying--you're not happy with our sex life? Rick reaches up and takes her hand. \nRICK No. Of course I'm happy, honey--our sex life is great--not that I wouldn't mind a little more, but-- look, one thing has nothing to do with the other. I think about sex a lot--all guys do--that's just the way it is. Maggie sits down beside him, clearly at the end of her rope. No one speaks for a few moments. Then: \nMAGGIE I'm giving you a hall pass. \n", "test2_true": "MAGGIE One week off from marriage. \nRICK You mean, like a trial separation? You are seriously overreacting. \nMAGGIE It's not a separation, it's a hall pass. You can do whatever you want. Get it out of your system. \nRICK \n(BEAT) Wait a minute--are you for real? \nMAGGIE It's not a yes or no offer, and it's not a debate. You're getting a hall pass. As Maggie heads upstairs, we PUSH IN on a confused Rick. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S KITCHEN - MORNING \nMaggie is washing out a pan at the sink when Rick ENTERS dressed for work. We hear the O.S. SOUNDS of The Wiggles coming from a TV in another room. \nRICK 'Morning. \nMAGGIE (not facing him) There's a couple hard-boiled eggs in a bowl there for you. \nRICK I'm gonna have to take them to go, hon, I've got a showing in fifteen minutes. Rick puts the eggs in his pocket, then approaches Maggie and kisses her on the cheek. \nRICK (CONT'D) Hey, about this hall pass business.. .1 don't want it and I don't need it. All I need is-- \nMAGGIE I told you, this isn't negotiable. She turns and faces him. \nRICK You're really serious about this? \nMAGGIE Rick, this isn't something that I...look, I really think you need this. I think we need this. Rick doesn't know what to say. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) This afternoon I'm taking the kids out to my parent's beach house. Rick REACTS to this. \nRICK For how long? \nMAGGIE We'll be back in one week. And as far as I'm concerned, starting right now. .. you have the week off from marriage. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - DAY \nThis is a big shiny place. All fixed-up. Fred pulls up in his mini-van and gets out. He walks past a Coldwell Banker For Sale sign with Rick's name on it. \nINT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - SAME \nRick is showing the kitchen to a COUPLE, mid-40's, when Fred \nENTERS. \nRICK Hey, what are you doing here? \nFRED I called your office and they told me you were in the neighborhood. Rick turns to the couple. \nRICK Oh, this is a friend of mine, Fred Searing. Fred, this is Harold and Nancy Goldberg--they're moving up here from Long Island. \nFRED Well, mazel tov, folks. The Goldbergs look at Fred a little warily as he takes out a card. \nFRED (CONT'D) Here, let me give you my card. Home, auto, or life insurance--I'm the go-to mensch in town. \nHAROLD GOLDBERG We're good on insurance. Rick quickly jumps in. \nRICK (to the Goldbergs) Uh, why don't you two take another look around and if you have any questions I'll be right here. \nHAROLD GOLDBERG Thank you. The Goldbergs walk out and Rick closes the door behind them. \nRICK \n(HUSHED) What the he 1 are you doing--I'm trying to make a sale here. \nFRED You weren't picking up your cell--I wanted to see how much trouble you got in last night. You know what Grace made me do? She made me call the Longs and apologize. Rick flinches. \nRICK Oof . \nFRED How 'bout you--did Maggie freak out when you got home? \nRICK Uh... sort of. Rick peeks out the kitchen door to make sure the Goldberg's aren't listening. Then: \nRICK (CONT'D) She gave me a hall pass. \nFRED A what? \nRICK A week off from marriage to do whatever I want. She's going to her parents' house down the Cape 'til next Sunday. Fred SNICKERS. \nFRED Yeah, right. \n", "test2_id": 1318, "test3_input": "RICK I'm serious. \nFRED You're full of shit. \nRICK Fred, it's true. You think I could make something like this up? Fred stares at him. \nFRED I don't get it--why aren't you more excited? \nRICK Well...I don't know how I feel. \nFRED About...? \nRICK The hall pass. Something about it isn't right. \nFRED You mean, like, you think Maggie might have a brain tumor or something? \nRICK No. I mean, just because my wife tells me it's okay to cheat... is it? \nFRED Uh, yeah. \n(BEAT) Why can't you just accept the fact that your wife is a goddamn saint, Rick? She's evolved. Don't you see? She gets it! \nRICK Yeah, but there's a part of me that's saying, 'Wow, you must have pushed her pretty hard to get her to this point.' And is that good for a marriage? That your wife is willing to try something this insane? Fred can't believe his ears. \nFRED Absolutely! \n(BEAT) Come on, doesn't it bother you that our wives dreams all come true, but ours don't? Look at Maggie; when she was a kid she played house--you g a ve her a house. She played with her E-Z-Bake Oven--you bought her a Viking. She played mommy--you made her a mommy. \nRICK The oven's a GE. \nFRED It's a real gas oven! And what about you, huh? Come on, man, your wife is living her dreams.. .and now it's time for you to live yours. As Rick thinks about this, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRED & GRACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nFred and Grace climb the stairs at the end of the day. \nFRED I don't know, I think this is some very forward-thinking on Maggie's part. \nGRACE Quit lobbying--you're not getting a hall pass. And you mark my words, this is going to end up biting Maggie in the ass. At the top of the stairs Fred puts his arms around her. \nFRED Why would I need a hall pass? I've got you. \nGRACE Not tonight you don't. I'm too bloated and I have cramps. \nFRED I don't mind. \nGRACE Fred, do I have to spell it out for you? I'm having my period. \nFRED \n(MATTER-OF-FACT) Yeah, I got that. He moves in for a kiss but she pulls away. \nGRACE Come on, hon, give me a break. Not tonight. Disappointed, Fred watches her walk toward the bedroom. \nFRED \n(CALLING OUT) Oh, shit--I forgot to take the trash out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FRED & GRACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nFred's mini-van is parked on the street in front of his home. We HEAR Styx's The Best of Times coming from inside the car and we MOVE IN CLOSER until we're... LOOKING THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW at Fred. He's sitting in the driver's seat; his EYES ARE CLOSED and his head is slung back as he JERKS-OFF (just below frame) to the MUSIC. A POLICE CRUISER passes in the b.g., then a moment later BACKS INTO FRAME and STOPS NEXT TO FRED. As the two POLICE OFFICERS look on from their car trying to figure out what the guy is doing, the oblivious Fred continues to STROKE HIS MEAT to the BEAT. \nOfficer #1 gets out of the driver's side. He DISAPPEARS FROM FRAME and then REAPPEARS at Fred's driver's side window. Now only inches from Fred, he bends over and LOOKS INSIDE THE \nCAR. The Officer motions for his partner to join him. As Fred continues to POUND HIMSELF TO THE MUSIC, Officer #2 climbs out of the cruiser. He takes out his flashlight and SHINES IT ON FRED'S O.S. LAP. As the weary officers look at each other with a NOW-WE'VE-SEEN-IT-ALL EXPRESSION, we... \nCUT TO: \nSAME SCENE - LATER The police lights are FLASHING now and several NEIGHBORS have gathered on their front lawns to see what's going on. PAN to Fred's front steps where we see a HANDCUFFED Fred standing meekly as the two Police Officers confer with a furious-looking Grace (in her bathrobe.) \nOFFICER #1 All right, ma'am, if you say he's yours.. .you can have him. The Officer TAKES OFF FRED'S HANDCUFFS. \nGRACE Thank you, officers. Fred scurries into the house ahead of Grace. As soon as the door shuts, we HEAR: \nGRACE (O.S.) (CONT'D) \nWHAT KIND OF SICK PRICK JERKS OFF \nIN HIS OWN FRONT YARD?! As the Police Officers head back to their car, we go... CLOSE ON a smiling Fred. \nFRED I got a Hall Pass! \nINT. RICK'S OFFICE - DAY \n", "test3_true": "RICK How? \nFRED Doesn't matter how. I got one. Can you believe it?! I got a hall pass! Rick stands up, elated. \nRICK And I've got a hall pass! \nFRED We both have hall passes! \nRICK When does yours start? Fred looks at his watch. \nFRED Twenty-three minutes ago! She just left for the Cape--she's staying with Maggie. It's just you and me for the next six days! \nRICK Oh my God, do you realize how much easier this is going to make it-- having a hall pass partner? \nFRED And it's not just me--Baker, Gary, and Hog-head are coming out with us tonight! \nRICK No way?! They got hall passes, too?! \nFRED No, no, no--they just want to watch. Rick grows concerned. \nRICK You think that's a good idea, letting them in on it? What if they blab and it gets around town--it might embarrass our wives. \nFRED Don't worry, I already talked to them. Their lips are sealed. Rick and Fred smile. \nFRED (CONT'D) We're living the dream, baby! \nSMASH CUT TO: Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER: \nDAY 1 \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nRick, Fred, and their MIDDLE-AGED POSSE (Baker, Hog-head & Gary) walk across a boulevard like rock stars. (Think of the SLO-MO shots from Swingers or Reservoir Dogs.) Nobody smiles, they're all business as they hit the sidewalk and march straight into ...APPLEBEE'S. \nINT. APPLEBEE'S - MOMENTS LATER \nThey step up to the bar. \nRICK \n(TO BARTENDER) Five MGD's, my friend. While waiting for the beers, the guys CHECK OUT THE SCENE. It's mostly FAMILIES, a few YOUNG COUPLES. \nRICK (CONT'D) The guy at the Holiday Inn Express told me this place really kicks in around nine-thirty. \nBAKER Hey, why are you staying at a hotel if your wives are out of town? \nFRED Well, we can't very well take babes back to our places--if they know where we live they might end up stalking us. \nRICK Besides, I wouldn't be able to concentrate with all the pictures everywhere and the kids' cut-outs all over the fridge. \nGARY Yeah, isn't it weird how your own kids can creep you out sometimes? Rick shoots Gary a look. \nFRED I get the feeling there's a lot of divorcees in this place. \nHOG-HEAD That's good. Divorcees are into kinky sex--that's why they're divorced. Just then the BARTENDER arrives with the Miller Genuine Drafts and the guys CLINK BOTTLES. \nHOG-HEAD (CONT'D) So come on, point out which girls you guys are gonna do tonight. Gary elbows Fred as he spots TWO MIDDLE-AGED WOMEN at the end of the bar. \nGARY What about those two? Why don't you bang them? \nFRED No way. They're doing the \nSWEATSHIRT-AROUND-THE-WAIST THING-- they're obviously hiding something back there. \nGARY Okay, how about the blonde hostess? Maybe somebody should nail her, huh? \nRICK Attempt to be cool, Gary--we've got a whole week. Baker looks around at the lame bar scene. \nBAKER Are you guys sure that Applebee's is the best place to be picking up women? \nRICK What are you thinking--Olive Garden? \nGARY Nah, that's only good on Thursday nights. \nHOG-HEAD Hey, what about the auto show? Baker shoots them a look. \nBAKER Are you guys for real? \nGARY Wait a second--where's Coakley? That's where we should be. \nBAKER He's in Iceland. \nRICK What's he doing there? \nBAKER What do you think he's doing there? The guys all nod at this, proud of him. \n", "test3_id": 1319}

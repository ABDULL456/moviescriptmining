{"train": "HALL PASS \nWritten by \nPeter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly, Kevin Barnett & Pete Jones \nSeptember 18, 2009 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nVery late. All is quiet. Then a battered MINI-VAN blows by a row of hedges that have been pruned to read: 'WELCOME TO CAPE COD.' A moment later a FLASHING COP CAR flies by in HOT \nPURSUIT. \nINT. MINI-VAN - SAME \nThe WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back the hair of two BEAT-UP-LOOKING MEN. The driver, FRED SEARING, 40-ish, has a look of determination and resolve on his chunky face, despite the BLACK EYE and BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE dangling out of his nose. The nervous passenger is RICK MILLS, 38. \nRICK Pull over, man! \nFRED No way, I can out-run 'em! \nRICK No you can't--not in this thing! Another POLICE CRUISER FISHTAILS OUT OF A SIDE STREET and \nJOINS THE CHASE. \nRICK (CONT'D) Oh God, now there's two of 'em! \nFRED I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til we get there! \nRICK Are you crazy?! \nFRED Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my wife! \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF A CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHT Rick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ENTRANCE followed by the two police cruisers. When they stop, we see that somebody has spray-painted 'HORNY OLD MAN' on the side of the mini-van. Fred jumps out and SPRINTS toward the entrance. SEVERAL COPS spring from their cars and give chase. Before Fred can reach the front doors, he gets KNOCKED VIOLENTLY to the ground. Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED. \nRICK Hear me out, gentlemen, I can explain every--! AS A BURLY OFFICER'S HEAD CONNECTS WITH RICK'S CHEST, we... \nFREEZE FRAME \n.And FADE TO BLACK... and then: \nSMASH CUT TO: Law & Order MUSIC CUE as we SUPER: \nTWO WEEKS EARLIER \nFADE BACK IN: \nINT. RICK'S FAMILY ROOM - DAY \nON TV SCREEN - a video shows several YOUNG PEOPLE, early- 20's, sunning themselves at the beach. A YOUNG-LOOKING RICK hams it up for the camera. \nRICK (O.S.) See the stud in the blue shorts? That's me the summer I got out of college. \nLITTLE GIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) Wow, Dad, you used to have muscles. REVERSE ANGLE reveals EMMA, 6, and GUNNAR, 4, sitting on either side of Rick. \nRICK I still have a few. \nGUNNAR Where? Rick shoots him a look. \nRICK They're hidden. BACK ON TV SCREEN - A PRETTY GIRL with a knockout body comes up and puts her arms around Rick. \nEMMA Who's that girl? \nRICK That's Mommy. \nEMMA No, I mean the young one standing next to you. \nRICK That's Mommy. \nEMMA Mommy used to have long hair? And she wore a bikini? \nRICK \n(WISTFULLY) Yes she did. \nEMMA How come she doesn't wear a bikini anymore? \nGUNNAR Is it because of her fat ass? \nRICK I guess. What? No. Who said Mommy's got a fat ass? \nGUNNAR Mommy. \nLONG BEAT. \n(GETTING IT) It was your air space. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hey, guys. They turn to see a BEAUTIFUL WOMAN with a healthy tan walking past carrying several drinks. This is MISSY FRANKENFIELD, mid-30's. \nRICK AND FRED Hey, Missy. \nMISSY (CALLING back to them) Don't forget to mingle! The guys watch Missy walk away. \nFRED Wow. Missy's looking pretty good for someone going through a divorce. \nRICK Yeah, that's rough stuff--I heard they might have to sell the house. \nFRED Too bad. You gonna hit 'em up for the listing? \nRICK What am I, a vulture? Nah, I don't go after the divorcee business unless they approach me first. \nFRED Yeah, it's kind of tacky, huh? As the guys crane their necks to get a better view of Missy's ass, we... REVERSE ANGLE to reveal Maggie, Grace and Dr. Lucy sipping lemondrops and watching Rick and Fred from across the room. \nGRACE Look at those two meatheads checking out Missy Frankenfield. What, do they think they're invisible over there? \nMAGGIE I thought you said Fred wasn't a gawker. \nGRACE He was standing right next to you. I can't let him know that I know-- that would take all the fun out of it. \n(CHUCKLES) You should see him. He's got some stupid move where he looks back before the girl passes to make it seem like he couldn't help but notice her ass. It's pathetic. Maggie and Dr. Lucy GIGGLE. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nRick's car is parked in the driveway, and he and Maggie are getting out. \nRICK How about I drive the babysitter home while you go upstairs and prepare the altar? He puts his arm around her as they walk toward the front door. \nMAGGIE I want to, honey, but I've got to get up early with the kids. \nRICK I'll get up with the kids. \nMAGGIE But I have to go out and buy a gift- -they're going to a birthday party tomorrow. \nRICK I'll cjet the gift, then I'll take the kids to the park, then to the party. You can dust stay in bed,, get your beauty sleep, and bask in the sweet, sweet pounding I'm about to give you. \nMAGGIE I love it when you sweet-talk me. Maggie smiles but as Rick opens the front door they FREEZE IN \nTHEIR TRACKS. THEIR POV - the babysitter (PAIGE, 20, cute) is standing there with their 4-year-old, Gunnar. \nGUNNAR Mommy! Daddy! \nRICK \n(DEFLATED) Little buddy.. .what are you doing up? Gunnar runs into his mother's arms and Maggie shrugs apologetically to Rick. \nRICK (CONT'D) This is just a minor obstacle. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - NIGHT \nRick is at the wheel of his Dodge Caravan and Paige sits in the passenger seat. She is on the busty side. \nRICK How were the kids tonight? \nPAIGE Perfect. That Gunnar is so cute-- all he wants to do is wrestle with me. Rick smiles at this. \nPAIGE (CONT'D) Mr. Mills, would it be okay to turn down the air--I'm a little chilly. Look--I got goose bumps. As she HOLDS OUT HER ARM to show him the GOOSE-BUMPS, we RACK FOCUS BEYOND HER ARM to the ERECT NIPPLES that are PIERCING THROUGH HER SHEER TOP like small tents. BACK ON Rick as his EYES GO WIDE WITH TERROR and he looks away. \nRICK Oh, uh, sure, I'm sorry. Flustered, he moves to the temperature control which in LARGE ILLUMINATED DIGITAL TYPE reads: 69!!! He quickly PUNCHES THE A/C OFF, then trains his eyes straight ahead and grips the steering wheel tight at ten-and-two. \nPAIGE Thank you. \nRICK 'Welcome. \nEXT. COLLEGE CAMPUS - NIGHT \nThe mini-van pulls up in front of a sorority house. \nINT. RICK'S MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS \nPaige hesitates before getting out. \nPAIGE Mr. Mills, can I ask you something? \nRICK Sure. \nPAIGE I was wondering... \n(SQUINTS NERVOUSLY) .could you buy me some beer? Rick looks surprised. \nEmma is putting Rick's HAIR INTO PONYTAILS. \nRICK Okay, honey, this is the last pony and then night-night. Emma finishes putting on a rubberband, then looks at him, satisfied. \nEMMA There. You look pretty, Daddy. \nRICK Okay, now give me a kiss, hug and go to sleep. She lays back on her pillow. Rick gives her a big kiss on both cheeks. \nRICK (CONT'D) I love you, Emma. \nEMMA I love you, too, Daddy. \nEXT. HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nRick (still in ponytails) tip-toes out of Emma's bedroom, closes the door so tly, then HUSTLES DOWN THE HALLWAY. \nF \nINT. RICK & MAGGIE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRick scrambles into the room and STOPS IN HIS TRACKS. \nHIS POV - Maggie lays in bed, FAST ASLEEP. \nRICK No. Please, no. Rick wants to wake her up but sees that she needs the sleep, so he just PULLS THE COVERS OVER HER SHOULDERS. As Rick walks around the bed and INTO THE BATHROOM in the b.g., we HOLD ON MAGGIE until she OPENS HER EYES. She listens to her husband brush his teeth with perhaps a tinge of GUILT, and when he shuts off the faucet, she CLOSES HER EYES AGAIN, and we... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARK - MORNING \nRick pushes Gunnar and Emma on the swings as a sweaty Fred APPROACHES carrying a tennis racket. (We see several TENNIS COURTS in the b.g.) \nFRED Hey. \nRICK Hey. How'd you make out? \nFRED Great. Lost both sets. \nRICK So'd you get the business? Fred nods and wipes his brow. \nFRED Pretty sure I got the Auto and Home. He told me to call his accountant on Monday about the Life. \nRICK Nice. Fred looks around at all the pretty MOMS and NANNIES with their CHILDREN. \nFRED Can you believe the talent here today? \nRICK \n(PAINED) Yeah. I know. They NOTICE something O.S.. THEIR POV - we see a SCANDINAVIAN AU PAIR bent over EXPOSING HER THONG UNDERWEAR as she picks up a CHILD from a wagon. \nFRED Ouch. \nRick SIGHS. \nRICK CPR girl's back, too. Rick nods toward A PIG-TAILED PARAMEDIC, early 30's, TEACHING A CPR CLASS. The two men look on solemnly. \nFRED Imagine if we were coming here back when we were single? \nRICK \n(FALSE BRAVADO) Oh baby, the damage we would do. \nEMMA Monkey bars! The kids JUMP off the swings and RUN for the jungle gym. \nGUNNAR Me first! Rick trails them like a Sherpa carrying a couple Razor scooters and a basketball as Fred tags along. They shlep past THE TRI-DELTA SORORITY playing ultimate frisbee and \nWEARING 'JUICY' SWEATS. \nFRED So you get lucky last night? \nRICK Nah, the kids were up when we got home. How 'bout you? \nFRED Well, kinda lucky. Grace conked right out so I snuck out to the car and rubbed one out. Rick shoots Fred a look. \nRICK The car? What are you Knight Rider? Why didn't you just go in the bathroom like a normal guy? \nFRED And get caught by Grace? Can't risk it. Besides, cars turn me on--it's where I lost my virginity. And they're comfy--I just put the seat back and turn on the tunes. The guys sit on a bench. \nRICK That's one of the things they don't tell you when you're young--that you'll still be jerking-off after you get married. I thought it was dust gonna be a teenage thing. \nFRED Yeah, I didn't see that one coming. The two men sit in silence for a LONG BEAT as the Frisbee Girls play all around them. \nFRED (CONT'D) You know what I miss the most? \nRICK What? \nFRED The arch. \nED That's because you were shooting laser beams at the java babe. \nRICK Well, no, we were just-- \nED Come on, gentlemen, you're married men and she's half your age--grow \nP- The guys can't muster a response. \nED (CONT'D) So I guess I'll be seeing you at the house-warming party this weekend. \nRICK Hm? \nED This Saturday afternoon at the new casa--we're inally in and we're having a little celebration. \nRICK Oh, I don't know if we can-- \nED Your wives already RSVP'd. \nRICK Right on. \nED 'Til then. Ed HOLDS OUT HIS FIST to them. \nED (CONT'D) Come on, pound the potato. Rick and Fred reluctantly take turns TAPPING Ed's fist with theirs. Then Ed leaves. \nFRED \n(UNDER BREATH) What a d-bag. \nRICK He's right though. Fred looks at Rick. \nRICK (CONT'D) What are we doing sitting here gawking at her for? We're married men--it's creepy. \nFRED I don't see what the big deal is-- we're not hurting anyone. What is he Big Brother--he's gonna tell me what I can look at now? For God sakes, don't take that away from me- -it's all I got! As Rick thinks about this, we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. RICK'S FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT \nCLOSE ON A BABY MONITOR - PULL BACK to reveal that it's in the middle of a POKER TABLE next to a pile of ONE-DOLLAR BILLS. Sitting around the table PLAYING LIAR'S POKER are Rick, Fred, GARY, HOG-HEAD, BAKER, and FLATS, all in their mid-30's to mid-40's. Hog-head has a huge melon, Baker is husky, Flats is a pale red-head, and Gary is slight and squirrelly. \nBAKER Rick, you open. Rick takes a fresh DOLLAR BILL off the pile in front of him and STUDIES THE SERIAL NUMBERS. \nRICK Four 9's. \nFRED Hey, where's Coakley? How come he didn't show? \nGARY Vegas. Hawaiian Tropic finals. The guys nod their approval. \nBAKER Man, imagine being Coakley? The guy's single, he's loaded, chicks love him, he doesn't have to answer to anybody. \nGARY That's the life. \nFRED That is the life. \nHOG-HEAD Let me ask you something: What would you guys pay to have your way with a Hawaiian Tropic girl for an entire weekend? The guys perk up as they think about this. \nHOG-HEAD (CONT'D) You get to pick any one you want-- and you know up front that you won't get her pregnant, no diseases, you're never gonna hear from her again, and your wife will never find out. \nGARY How's it possible to know that my wife won't find out? \nHOG-HEAD \n(ANNOYED) It's not. I'm saying if it were possible, like if I was a magic genie and I could grant you this wish but then make it like it never even happened. \nFLATS But would I still have memory of it? \nHOG-HEAD Oh yeah. Great memories. \nGARY Oof. I think I'd pay 500 bucks for that. Baker shoots him a look. \nBAKER You cheap,bastard. We're talking about an investment that gets your rocks off and protects your wife's feelings. I'd pay five grand. \nRICK Wow. \nGARY Well, excuse me, Mr. Wall Street, but us public school teachers aren't getting any of that bail-out money you're over-tipping everyone with. Just then, the front door OPENS and Maggie ENTERS. \nMAGGIE Hey, guys. \nRICK Oh, hey, honey. How was the book club? \nMAGGIE Great. \nFRED What did you guys read this month? \nMAGGIE Hemingway. \nGARY Old Man and the Sea? \n(RECOVERING) Come on, be reasonable, it was just guy-talk--it's not like it could really happen. Maggie shakes her head, disgusted, and leaves the room. \nRICK (CONT'D) \n(CALLING OUT) Love you! \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nMaggie, Grace, and Dr. Lucy eat at an upscale restaurant. Dr. Lucy listens quietly to the women. \nGRACE Fred said five grand? What a blowhard! \nMAGGIE You know what's even funnier? Hog- head McCormick said he'd pay seven grand. \nGRACE What?! That bum hasn't worked since the dot-com bust--his wife supports him! The girls LAUGH. \nGRACE (CONT'D) Well, look on the bright side: At least they're not cheating on us. \nMAGGIE Sometimes I wonder if it would be better if they did cheat and get it over with. \nDR. LUCY You mean, rather than take the slow boat to resentment? The girls look to Dr. Lucy. \nDR. LUCY (CONT'D I'm just saying.. .maybe a little freedom would be good for them. And for you. \n(BEAT) Have you ever considered giving them a hall pass? \nGRACE A what? \nDR. LUCY A hall pass. A week off from marriage. Grace and Maggie stop chewing. \nMAGGIE Wait a minute. . .Are you saying let them go out and cheat? \nDR. LUCY I'm saying give them a week off from marriage. \n(BEAT) Look, most married men have foggy memories of their single days and they somehow get under the impression that if not for you, they'd be able to be with ail those women who entice them. \nGRACE That's Fred. He thinks because he sees big tits everywhere and then still comes home for dinner that I should be welcoming him at the door like some conquering hero. Dr. Lucy smiles. \nDR. LUCY Well, maybe it's time to let them go out there and find out what it's really like. \nMAGGIE Wow. You're talking about the nuclear option. Maggie ponders the idea. \nGRACE And remind me again, what good could possibly come from this...? \nDR. LUCY There's a wonderful principle in psychology called 'reactance theory.' It basically states that if you're constantly told you can't do something, you want to do it more than ever. And conversely, if you remove the taboo, you remove the obsession. Grace makes a 't' sound. \nGRACE \n(SARCASTIC) I got an idea, Doc: Why don't you try a hall pass out on your husband and let us know how it works out. \nDR. LUCY Oh, I have. Grace and Maggie REACT to this. \nMAGGIE You're telling us you let Charlie sleep with another woman? Dr. Lucy takes a moment before answering. \nDR. LUCY I am not telling you that. I am telling you that I gave him the freedom to choose for himself. \nGRACE And...? \nDR. LUCY All I know is...our marriage is better than ever. Grace and Maggie think about this. \nGRACE I don't know. There's a reason that men evolved and apes didn't. It's because women demanded more. Without a wife, Einstein would've been humping a maple tree all day. As the women LAUGH, we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ED & KIMMY LONG'S ESTATE - DAY \nThere are several flashy cars out front of this huge McMansion. As Fred and Grace and Rick and Maggie get out of Fred's mini-van, Ed Long comes out of the house to greet them. (Ed's 5-YEAR-OLD SON is beside him wearing khakis and a Polo shirt, just like his father.) \nGRACE There he is! The lord of the manor! \nED Come on, everyone in the shack! The grand tour's about to begin! \nINT. STUDY - AFTERNOON \nEd and his wife KIMMY (late-30's, high-maintenance) lead Rick, Fred, Maggie, Grace, and SEVERAL OTHER GUESTS into a large wood-paneled study. (The Long's 7-YEAR-OLD DAUGHTER sticks to her mother's side WEARING A MATCHING DRESS.) \nED I call it headquarters. LARRY BOHAC, mid-40's, and his blonde bombshell of a wife, MANDY, (who wears A TOO-TIGHT T-SHIRT) look around in awe. \nMANDY Un-believable. \nED That's sweet of you to say, Mandy. \nLARRY It's epic, Ed. Ed points to one wall which houses a GLASSED-IN HUMIDOR. \nED \nRICK I'm serious. \nFRED You're full of shit. \nRICK Fred, it's true. You think I could make something like this up? Fred stares at him. \nFRED I don't get it--why aren't you more excited? \nRICK Well...I don't know how I feel. \nFRED About...? \nRICK The hall pass. Something about it isn't right. \nFRED You mean, like, you think Maggie might have a brain tumor or something? \nRICK No. I mean, just because my wife tells me it's okay to cheat... is it? \nFRED Uh, yeah. \n(BEAT) Why can't you just accept the fact that your wife is a goddamn saint, Rick? She's evolved. Don't you see? She gets it! \nRICK Yeah, but there's a part of me that's saying, 'Wow, you must have pushed her pretty hard to get her to this point.' And is that good for a marriage? That your wife is willing to try something this insane? Fred can't believe his ears. \nFRED Absolutely! \n(BEAT) Come on, doesn't it bother you that our wives dreams all come true, but ours don't? Look at Maggie; when she was a kid she played house--you g a ve her a house. She played with her E-Z-Bake Oven--you bought her a Viking. She played mommy--you made her a mommy. \nRICK The oven's a GE. \nFRED It's a real gas oven! And what about you, huh? Come on, man, your wife is living her dreams.. .and now it's time for you to live yours. As Rick thinks about this, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRED & GRACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nFred and Grace climb the stairs at the end of the day. \nFRED I don't know, I think this is some very forward-thinking on Maggie's part. \nGRACE Quit lobbying--you're not getting a hall pass. And you mark my words, this is going to end up biting Maggie in the ass. At the top of the stairs Fred puts his arms around her. \nFRED Why would I need a hall pass? I've got you. \nGRACE Not tonight you don't. I'm too bloated and I have cramps. \nFRED I don't mind. \nGRACE Fred, do I have to spell it out for you? I'm having my period. \nFRED \n(MATTER-OF-FACT) Yeah, I got that. He moves in for a kiss but she pulls away. \nGRACE Come on, hon, give me a break. Not tonight. Disappointed, Fred watches her walk toward the bedroom. \nFRED \n(CALLING OUT) Oh, shit--I forgot to take the trash out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FRED & GRACE'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nFred's mini-van is parked on the street in front of his home. We HEAR Styx's The Best of Times coming from inside the car and we MOVE IN CLOSER until we're... LOOKING THROUGH THE PASSENGER WINDOW at Fred. He's sitting in the driver's seat; his EYES ARE CLOSED and his head is slung back as he JERKS-OFF (just below frame) to the MUSIC. A POLICE CRUISER passes in the b.g., then a moment later BACKS INTO FRAME and STOPS NEXT TO FRED. As the two POLICE OFFICERS look on from their car trying to figure out what the guy is doing, the oblivious Fred continues to STROKE HIS MEAT to the BEAT. \nOfficer #1 gets out of the driver's side. He DISAPPEARS FROM FRAME and then REAPPEARS at Fred's driver's side window. Now only inches from Fred, he bends over and LOOKS INSIDE THE \nCAR. The Officer motions for his partner to join him. As Fred continues to POUND HIMSELF TO THE MUSIC, Officer #2 climbs out of the cruiser. He takes out his flashlight and SHINES IT ON FRED'S O.S. LAP. As the weary officers look at each other with a NOW-WE'VE-SEEN-IT-ALL EXPRESSION, we... \nCUT TO: \nSAME SCENE - LATER The police lights are FLASHING now and several NEIGHBORS have gathered on their front lawns to see what's going on. PAN to Fred's front steps where we see a HANDCUFFED Fred standing meekly as the two Police Officers confer with a furious-looking Grace (in her bathrobe.) \nOFFICER #1 All right, ma'am, if you say he's yours.. .you can have him. The Officer TAKES OFF FRED'S HANDCUFFS. \nGRACE Thank you, officers. Fred scurries into the house ahead of Grace. As soon as the door shuts, we HEAR: \nGRACE (O.S.) (CONT'D) \nWHAT KIND OF SICK PRICK JERKS OFF \nIN HIS OWN FRONT YARD?! As the Police Officers head back to their car, we go... CLOSE ON a smiling Fred. \nFRED I got a Hall Pass! \nINT. RICK'S OFFICE - DAY \nRICK Look, before we go bagging any chicks, I gotta get a hunk of beef in me. \nGARY Hey, I got a guy over at Outback Steak House who could set us up. \nBAKER Ooooh, he's got pull over at Outback. Wow. \nRICK Hey, I like Outback. Let's chug these and hit the road. \nAs the guys drink up, Hog-head puts his arm around Gary. \nHOG-HEAD Hey, Gar, you don't happen to have any connections at 7/11, do ya? Maybe someone could hook me up with a player's card so I can cut right to the front of the raspberry slurpy line. The guys all LAUGH, as we \nCUT TO: \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF CAPE COD BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT This is an old summer shack nestled on a quiet bluff overlooking the sound. \nINT. BEACH COTTAGE - SAME \nGrace stands at the window staring out on the ocean, while Maggie nestles on the couch reading a summer novel. The kids are asleep and the place is quiet. \nGRACE I think we might've made a huge mistake. \nMAGGIE Stop thinking about it, Grace. Why don t you just try to get some sleep? Grace turns to Maggie. \nGRACE Sleep? I can't sleep. I don't understand you--how can you Just sit there and read knowing that Rick could be making out with a supermodel right now? Maggie doesn't answer. \nGRACE (CONT'D) Our husbands aren't married this week. Do you know what husbands do when they're not married? \nMAGGIE Shh. You're going to wake the kids. \nGRACE Are you going to sit there and tell me you're not the least bit concerned about what they're doing right now? Maggie SIGHS. \nMAGGIE Okay... I'm a little concerned. \nGrace flops into the chair across from her. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Of course I'm concerned. But what choice did we have? \nGRACE We could've kept the status quo. I mean, were things really that bad that we had to try something this extreme? \nMAGGIE For me they were. \n(BEAT) Look, you may call this a hall pass, but for me it's more of a Hail Mary pass. I'm serious, I don't know what else to do. Grace looks at Maggie, surprised. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Remember last week when we went to Lucy's award thing? Grace nods. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) That night when we got home, Rick and I were gonna.. .you know... and I was waiting for him in bed while he tucked the kids in, and I started wondering who he would be thinking about during sex. Would it be the girl he checked out on the way into the party? Or would it be Missy Frankenfield--because I noticed him gawking at her? Or how about one of the waitresses, or maybe somebody he saw at work that day? Then when he came into the room, I did something I'd never done before: I pretended to be asleep. \nGRACE You're kidding me? You've never done that? I do that all the time! Maggie almost smiles. \nMAGGIE Look, I understand that people have fantasies and that you're not always thinking about the person you're with. \nGRACE That's for sure. \nMAGGIE But it's just...I don't know... it's been too long since I felt that he was thinking about me. \nThey sit there for a moment, quiet. Then: \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) I need this hall pass to work, Grace, because if it doesn't, I don't know what's going to happen. \nCUT TO: \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE - NIGHT We see two VERY OLD COUPLES walking out with doggie bags. \nINT. OUTBACK STEAKHOUSE - SAME \nOur five guys are in a MEAT COMA, slouched in their chairs nursing red wines and talking through PURPLE TEETH. Several \nEMPTY WINE BOTTLES, MARTINI GLASSES, HALF-EATEN STEAKS, CARVED UP POTATO AU GRATIN and CREAMED SPINACH PLATES, and MANGLED KEY-LIME PIES litter the table. \nBAKER Okay... so where to now? Rick can't think in this state. \nRICK Fred...? \nFRED Hm? \nRICK Answer Baker. \nFRED What's the question? \nRICK What are we doing for the rest of the night? \nFRED \n(DISINTERESTED) I don't know. Getting laid, right? \nHOG-HEAD I gotta go home and poo. \nRICK COLEMAN I hate to break it to you but your old man's the one who's been taking all the money--he's a thief. Maggie's Father LAUGHS. \nRICK COLEMAN (CONT'D) Hey, everyone's coming back to my place for some beers and a barbecue- -why don't you join us? \nMAGGIE Oh, thanks, but we've gotta get the kids home. \nMAGGIE'S FATHER Your mom and I will take 'em home. You two go out and have a good time- -cripes, you haven't been out all week. Grace perks up at this. \nMAGGIE Oh, I don't know, Dad, we really \nHADN'T PLANNED-- \nGRACE Excuse me, can I have a word with you? Grace pulls Maggie aside. \nGRACE (CONT'D) \n(WHISPERING) What's your problem? \nMAGGIE Oh, come on, Grace, these guys are barely out of college, and, in case you've forgotten, we're married. \nGRACE To who? Last I heard, Rick and Fred had the week off from marriage. So remind me again--who are we married to? Maggie thinks about this. \nMAGGIE Well...I guess one beer won't kill us. \nGRACE \n(SMILING) That's my girl. Grace glances over at the ballplayers. \nGRACE (CONT'D) Why shouldn't we have fun? God knows our guys are living it up. \nCUT TO: \nA CLOSE-UP OF HOG-HEAD \nHOG-HEAD What would you guys rather do--make- out with a guy or let him blow you? PULL BACK TO REVEAL that... \nINT. ESPN SPORTS ZONE BAR - CONTINUOUS \n.Our five guys are sitting at the bar drinking beer and devouring plates of HOT WINGS. Around them we see about fifty TV's BLARING twenty different sporting events. There's ESPN logos everywhere and not a woman in sight. \nHOG-HEAD (CONT'D) And you've gotta pick one or someone in your family will die-- that's the rule. \nGARY Oh boy, that's a toughie. \nFRED How long would you have to make-out with him? \nHOG-HEAD Ten minutes. \nRICK Tongue? \nHOG-HEAD Of course. \nFRED And how long would he have to blow you? \nHOG-HEAD Seven minutes. \nGARY Oof. I mean, getting blown by a dude is bad, but making out with a guy, it's so.. .intimate. \nRICK You think it's more intimate than getting blown by a guy? \nGARY Way more. \nBAKER All right, the hell with this shit, I'm outta here. Baker gets up from his stool. \nRICK \n(TAKEN ABACK) What? Why? \nBAKER I wanted to watch you guys pick up chicks, not talk about dicks. \nFRED Hey, greased lightning, let off the gas--sometimes these things take time. \nGARY Baker's right. This is day three and you haven't even talked to a girl. \nRICK \n(POINTED) That's not exactly accurate, Gary. Thanks to your scrumptious brownies, I did spend half of last night talking to Judy on the drug- and-poison hotline. Hog-head and Gary stand. \nHOG-HEAD I guess I'm gonna get going, too. \nGARY Yeah, this is boring. You guys are pussies. \nFRED Hey, I haven't seen you guys talk to any girls. \nBAKER We don't have hall passes! \n(SHAKES HEAD) Come on, guys, let's go. The three friends start to leave but Hog-head stops and turns. \nGRACE What are you doing here? He KICKS OFF THE SKI, then runs over and SHAKES HIS WET BODY \nALL OVER THE GIRLS. \nGRACE & MAGGIE Gerry, stop it! \nGERRY Hey, where are the kiddies? We thought we'd take you all for a boat ride. \nMAGGIE My parents took them to Martha's Vineyard for the weekend. Just then, we hear a LOUD HORN. They look up to see the boat pulling close to shore. Rick Coleman is behind the wheel and a couple PLAYERS are in the back. Maggie waves. \nRICK COLEMAN \n(THROUGH BULLHORN) All right, everybody aboard! We're going waterskiing! The two women look at each other--why not? As they get up and RUN INTO THE WATER, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nRick stands in line at the coffee shop looking casual in slacks and a Harvard t-shirt. Music plays. He peers ahead and sees the Wannabe Artist-Type taking the order of a TEENAGE GIRL. At the other register, Coffee Girl is also taking orders. Rick is hoping to get Coffee Girl but Wannabe gets to him first. \nWANNABE Can I take your order? Rick sees that there's no one behind him. He turns to the Wannabe. \nRICK Uh...I don't know what I want. Wannabe stares at him, waiting. Rick hesitates a few moments, then levels with the guy. \nRICK (CONT'D) Look, man, I want her to take my order. \nWANNABE Why? \nRICK Uh, she knows how I like it. \nWANNABE \n(ATTITUDE) Little help, Leigh--your unique barista skills have been requested. Rick waves weakly to Leigh and winks. As Leigh approaches, Wannabe mocks Rick by waving at him and winking. \nLEIGH Hi. What would you like? Rick was hoping to have a conversation but Wannabe is crowding them. \nRICK Iced coffee. With two Splendas. Leigh rings him up. \nLEIGH That'll be two dollars. Rick hands her a fiver and nods toward the speakers. \nRICK By the way, nice tunes. Do you choose 'em or do they come down from corporate? \nLEIGH Me. It's Snow Patrol. \nShe hands Rick his change and he dumps it in the tip jar. \nRICK Nice soundtrack. Pretty solid movie, too. Wannabe BARKS out a LAUGH. \nWANNABE Dude, you're thinking of Snow Do s-- the Cuba Gooding kiddie flick. This is Snow Patrol, the band. Rick shrugs, a little embarrassed. \nLEIGH Thanks for the tip. As Leigh grabs a cup and goes to make the coffee, Wannabe SAYS SOMETHING to her that WE CAN'T HEAR and they both LAUGH. A PHONE RINGS in the employee room. Leigh hands Wannabe the coffee, then runs back to answer it. Wannabe hands Rick the iced coffee and winks at him. \nWANNABE Enjoy your two-Splenda'd iced coffee, mister. Rick starts to go, then turns around and stares at Wannabe. Wannabe, comforted by the counter between them, smiles back. \nRICK Why are you smiling? You think this counter is some alligator-infested moat? Rick's stare becomes a glare and Wannabe loses his smile. \nRICK (CONT'D) This little 'I'm-on-the-inside, too- cool-for-school, let's-laugh-at-the- \nDORKY-SUBURBAN-GUY-CAUSE-I'M-SAFE- \nON-THIS-SIDE-OF-THE-COUNTER' routine's gonna get you hurt. After you lose all of your family's money on your avante garde piece of crap short film, you're going to need a job. And it's guys like me that hire. And guys like me don't hire punks like you. So shape up. As Rick turns and walks out, we PAN over to see that Leigh \nHAS BEEN WATCHING THIS. \nEXT. COFFEE SHOP - A FEW MINUTES LATER \nRick sits alone at a table on the sidewalk drinking his coffee. He NOTICES some postcards advertising a two-week free trial at the local gym and starts to read them. \nLEIGH (O.S.) I work-out there. \nRick looks up, suddenly finding himself alone with Leigh. \nRICK You do? Leigh nods and starts to straighten up the tables. \nRICK (CONT'D) I work-out at home, but I was thinking of going public with my work-outs. What do you squat? She seems amused by this. \nLEIGH I don't really squat, just run on the hamster-wheel everyday after work. She starts wiping down a table. \nCOFFEE GIRL So did you go to Harvard? She nods at Rick's t-shirt. \nRICK Yeah. \n(BEAT) I mean, you know...I went to a party there once. Coffee Girl GIGGLES and Rick perks up. \nRICK (CONT'D) \n(RE:SHIRT) Actually, this is Harvard Health Care. Sleep apnea... snoring too much. (holds up gym postcard) So is this a good place to join? \nSONG .Night fever, night fever.. .we know how to do it...' As the song heats up, the crowd parts, REVEALING... Rick Coleman and Gerry decked-out in WHITE, TONY-MANARO-SUITS. They're DANCING UP A STORM with Maggie and Grace who are thrilled to be in such capable hands. Grace is getting tossed around a bit, but it's clear that Maggie can hold her own on a dance floor. \nThe crowd soon FORMS A CIRCLE around the two couples, and as Rick and Gerry SWING AND LIFT our delighted and breathless wives, we \nCUT TO: \nSAME SCENE - LATER Maggie and Rick Coleman are standing at the rail of the boat taking a breather. \nRICK COLEMAN Wow. You can really move out there. Maggie shrugs modestly. \nMAGGIE Thanks. I was a dance major in college. \nRICK COLEMAN Really? I always wondered--what do you do with a degree in dance? \nMAGGIE Well, as it turned out, nothing. \n(BLUSHING) I guess the original plan was to go to New York and try to hook-up with one of the big dance companies, but then I got married and. . .your priorities change. She looks away, maybe a little embarrassed. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Anyway, that was fun. I haven't danced this much in a long time. \nRICK COLEMAN Why not? \nMAGGIE I don't know, you get busy, kids, school, there's so much going on. \nRICK COLEMAN Well you gotta make time for the stuff you love or you'll forget who you are. Maggie appreciates the sentiment. She makes strong eye- contact with Rick for a moment, but catches herself and looks away. \nMAGGIE You know, my husband's name is Rick. Rick smiles at this. \nRICK COLEMAN Well that makes me the perfect guy to have an affair with--you'd never have to worry about screaming out the wrong name during sex. Maggie smiles at this, but she seems a nick uncomfortable. \nRICK COLEMAN (CONT'D) I'm kidding. \nMAGGIE I know. \nRICK COLEMAN Now come on, let's go find Grace and get something to eat. I'm starving. As they head back to the party, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. RICK'S TOYOTA AVALON - LATE AFTERNOON \nRick is parked across the street from FITNESS FIRM HEALTH CLUB. He's reading the newspaper and glancing at the entrance for Leigh. Suddenly there's a LOUD TAP on the window and Rick looks over to see Flats (who we met at Rick's poker night) standing outside with a shit-eating grin. Rick rolls down the window. \nFLATS Hey, Rick. \nRICK \n(STARTLED) Oh...hey, Flats. How you doing, man? \nFLATS Great. What's up with you? How's that hall pass thing going? Rick makes a Scooby Doo sound, alarmed. \nRICK Who told you about that--was it Hog- head? \nFLATS No. Some old lady was yakking about it down at the post office. Rick REACTS to this. \nFLATS (CONT'D) \n(BIG SMILE) So what's the deal--you getting laid? \nRICK \n(DEFENSIVE) What? No. \nRICK (CONT'D) I don't know where you're getting your information, Flats, but a hall pass isn't just about getting laid, it's about getting a week off from marriage to do as you please-- whether that be fishing, or watching TV, whatever it is that relaxes you. \nFLATS \n(DUBIOUS) Oh, I didn't know that. Just then Rick NOTICES Leigh (dressed in work-out clothes) walking down the sidewalk toward the gym. \nRICK Uh, Flatsy, I gotta run. I'm late for my work-out appointment. When Rick hops out of his car, we see that he's wearing gym shorts and an old Springsteen t-shirt. He hesitates, then grabs a SWEATSHIRT out of the car and TIES IT AROUND HIS WAIST. Rick hurries down the sidewalk toward Leigh. \nRICK (CONT'D) Hey, girl! \nLEIGH \n(SMILING) All right! You decided to go for it. As Rick follows Leigh into the gym, a smiling Flats CALLS \nOUT: \nFLATS Hey, Rick! Good luck with the fishing! As Flats begins to LAUGH, a sheepish Rick scurries into the building. \nINT. FITNESS FIRM HEALTH CLUB - MOMENTS LATER \nRick and Leigh stand at the front desk. A young, buff dude, CLYDE, looks up from folding towels. \nLEIGH Clyde, this is my friend, uh... \nRICK Rick. \nFRED (CONT'D) \n(WITH MOUTH-FULL) I envisioned a national holiday, right between July 4th and Labor Day, like the first Friday in August, Hall Pass Day; a day for husbands to get some strange, a day that would forever be known as the holiday,that saved the institution of marriage. \nRICK All right, don't give up. \nFRED I'm not giving up, I'm facing facts- -this is our last day and we got nothing cooking. Maybe you were right. Maybe we should just tell the girls to come home. \nRICK No. I want the hall pass. Fred looks at Rick, surprised. \nRICK (CONT'D) At first I wasn't sure, but now I want the dream. \nFRED I'm not even sure I know what the dream is anymore. \nRICK I just...I just want to know what it's like to be with another woman. \nFRED Well, just pull up one of the golden oldies in your spank bank-- it's almost like being there. \nRICK I don't have anything in that spank bank. \nFRED I'm talking about all the girls before you met Maggie. Rick doesn't say anything. \nFRED (CONT'D) What? \n(BEAT) No, you're not serious? Rick lowers his head. \nFRED (CONT'D) Wait a second, are you saying...? \n(BEAT) But how can that be--you didn't meet Maggie until college? \nRICK \n(DEFENSIVE) Yeah, so? What do you think, everyone gets laid in high school? I got news for you, mister--getting laid in high school is not a right, it's a privilege. Fred puts down his ice cream. Rick SIGHS. \nRICK (CONT'D) First class, first day, freshman year, I saw Maggie--she was sitting three seats away in Western Civ-- and I fell in love instantly. I begged her for three months to go out with me, she finally caved, and that night I told her I loved her. \nRICK (CONT'D) Eighty-four days later she told me she loved me back and we've been together ever since. Fred stares at him. \nFRED Wow. That's a really creepy story. Just then Fred's cell phone RINGS and he ANSWERS it. \nFRED (CONT'D) Hello. \n(BEAT) Yeah. \n(BEAT) Oh, okay, great. Fred hangs up but doesn't say anything. \nRICK Who was that? \nFRED Just an angel from heaven. Suddenly Fred jumps to his feet. \nFRED (CONT'D) Coakley's back in town! As Rick's face fills with renewed hope, we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEACH COTTAGE - AFTERNOON \nMaggie and Grace are sitting at the kitchen table gazing at a BOUQUET OF FLOWERS and an open GIFT BOX displaying an \nENGRAVED I.D. BRACELET. \nMAGGIE Does this mean you're going steady? \nGRACE \n(GUILTY) That's not funny. I feel terrible-- the poor kid's spending all his hard-earned money on me--that's sad. Cute, but sad. \nMAGGIE Grace, you should be flattered. You're thirty-eight-years-old and college kids are still swooning over you. \nGRACE Well I just feel bad if I gave him the wrong impression. \nMAGGIE The wrong impression? What makes you think that--I mean, besides the flowers, I.D. bracelet, and love letter? Maggie picks up a card. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) \n(READING) 'Dearest Grace--Our final game is tonight. Please meet me at the coach's place afterwards to celebrate. Yours truly, Gerry.' \nGRACE Thanks for piling on. Grace stands up and SIGHS. \nGRACE (CONT'D) Well...I can't accept this. I guess I'm just gonna have to go set him straight. \nCUT TO: \nESTABLISHING SHOT OF A PIZZERIA UNO - NIGHT \nINT. PIZZERIA UNO - SAME \nRick and Fred are sitting at a table sharing a pizza while Fred texts someone. \nPAIGE (CONT'D) In fact, I thought it was very classy of you to be staying at the Holiday Inn Express instead of bringing girls back to your home with all the kids' pictures and schoolwork taped up everywhere. Rick forces a smile. \nRICK Thank you. A male BARTENDER, 25, finally appears in front of Rick. \nRICK (CONT'D) Yeah, um, two bottles of Moet and six glasses please. Paige eyes Rick as she sips her drink. \nPAIGE So does it work both ways? \nRICK What? \nPAIGE The hall pass. Does your wife get one, too. \nRICK \n(AMUSED) Uh, no, no. A hall pass is for men only. \nPAIGE Oh. Who made that rule? \nRICK Well ...um... As Rick thinks about this, Paige moves in tighter. \nPAIGE By the way, I kind of owe you an apology. (lowers her voice, \nBASH Last week ful) when you drove me home, I shouldn't have snapped at you like that. \nRICK Oh, don't worry about it. It was a big misunderstanding. \nPAIGE No, it wasn't. She takes a moment, looks around. \nPAIGE (CONT'D) If you thought I was coming on to you that night, it's because...I was. Rick flinches at this. Just then the Bartender returns with the champagne. Rick fumbles through his pocket and finally pays. Then he's left alone with Paige and her coed-in-love- with-the-professor eyes and her suddenly heaving cleavage. \nRICK Yeah. Um...I have to go, Paige, but it was great seeing you. Paige grabs Rick's arm as he tries to go. She looks suddenly annoyed. \nPAIGE Are you serious? You're doing this again... even with a hall pass? \nRICK Paige, you're my kids' babysitter. Have a happy birthday. As Rick walks away, we go BACK ON COAKLEY AND FRED as Rick arrives with the champagne. \nCOAKLEY Here we go, bubbles doth floweth. \nFRED Holy crap... look who's here. The guys turn to see the coffee girl, Leigh, walking past with two of her GIRLFRIENDS. She sees them and LIGHTS UP. \nLEIGH Hey, Rick! What happened yesterday-- I thought we were gonna grab a beer? Fred looks at Rick, confused. \nRICK \n(SHEEPISH) Yeah, I got a little caught up in my curls and reps and shit. \n(CHANGING SUBJECT) So is this your playground? \nLEIGH Nah, I've never been here, but a friend of mine's DJ-ing tonight so I promised him I'd come. Just then Wannabe from the coffee shop swoo s in and gives Leigh a kiss on the cheek. He has a pair of headphones hanging around his neck. \nWANNABE Wassup, girl? \nWannabe NOTICES Rick and loses his smile. \nWANNABE (CONT'D) Oh. Hey. What are you doing here-- you auditing the place? \nRICK Actually, I work for Sirius XM Radio--we're looking to hire some new deejays so I'm checking out all the clubs. Wannabe stiffens, suddenly respectful. \nWANNABE Oh. Cool. Are you serious? \nRICK Not! Leigh is amused by this, but she tries to hide it from the deflated Wannabe. \nWANNABE \n(ANNOYED) Oh, that's hip. Real fresh. (turns to Leigh) Why don't you hit the dance floor-- the next song's gonna be for you. As Leigh's Girlfriends pull her onto the dance floor, Wannabe returns to his deejay booth. \nFRED \n(GLARING) Beer? When were you two going to have a beer? \nRICK \n(GUILTY) No, no, no, Leigh and I just belong to the same gym and happened to be there at the same time yesterday afternoon. \nFRED What gym do you belong to and where the hell was I? \nCOAKLEY Well, according to Kimmy Long, you were at the massage parlor trying to get a rub-and-tug without filling out the paperwork. This takes the wind out of Fred's sails. \nRICK What? Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick glares at Fred. \nRICK (CONT'D) I thought the massage parlor was admitting defeat? \nFRED I had a knot in my neck--why the hell didn't you tell me you saw Coffee Girl?! \nCOAKLEY Okay, guys, cut the crap. We're all here for the same thing. And I'll give you a hint what that thing is: It begins with a 'P' and ends with an 'ussy.' Coakley puts his arm around Fred. \nCOAKLEY (CONT'D) Now relax, Fredd , everyone's gonna get taken care ot. (looks out at crowd) We Just gotta find you a gazelle with a bad wheel. \nFRED \n(DEADPAN) If they came right now I would, sure. \nMISSY FRANKENFIELD (O.S.) There you are! Fred looks up to see Missy Frankenfield approaching. \nFRED Oh my god! You're here! Fred jumps off the bed and gives Missy a hug. \nFRED (CONT'D) Franken-berry, how the heck are ya?! She returns the embrace, but not quite as tight. \nFRED (CONT'D) You look incredible! \nMISSY FRANKENFIELD \n(CLEARLY UNCOMFORTABLE) Thanks, Fred, you look good, too. \nFRED Never felt better. Missy nods. \nMISSY FRANKENFIELD I have to say, I can't believe I'm actually here--I was on my way home from dinner when I noticed your text. So what's this big emergency? \nFRED Huh? Oh, uh, yeah. By 'emergency' I just meant that there's some important stuff I want to talk to you about. You know, one on one, me and you--without all the husbands and wives and hoopla. So how are you? \nMISSY FRANKENFIELD I'm... good. \nFRED No, I mean how-are-you. Inside. What's happenin' in there? There must be all sorts of emotions churning up with the divorce and everything. She gives him a long look. \nMISSY FRANKENFIELD Maybe we should go somewhere else-- this doesn't seem like the best place to spill one's guts. Just then, Coakley swoops in and pulls Fred aside. \nCOAKLEY \n(UNDER BREATH) What part of 'go ugly early' didn't you understand? You've got a better chance of winning husband-of-the- year than tagging that chiquita. Fred flinches at this. \nFRED But...I know her. She said she wants to leave with me. \nCOAKLEY Then she's insane--run for the hills. \nFRED Coak, the woman's going through a divorce. She's not insane, she's just making really poor decisions right now. (hands him his car keys) Here, give Rick the keys to my mini- van. I'm gonna go back to the hotel with Missy. Coakley looks back at Missy and softens. \nCOAKLEY It's your funeral, princess. BACK ON RICK AND LEIGH dancing up a storm. Rick is OUT OF BREATH and SWEATING LIKE A PIG. His shirt is soaked and his hair is dripping wet. \nLEIGH Are you okay--you keep checking your pulse? \nRICK Nah, I'm fine. I had a little chest cramp during the last song, but I worked through it. She smiles at this. \nLEIGH Come on, let's sit this one out. I need a breather. They move to the bar and Rick starts DRYING HIMSELF with a stack of cocktail napkins. \nLEIGH (CONT'D) So what's up with the ring? He looks at his finger, then back at her. \nRICK Um...have you ever heard of a hall pass? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BALL TEAM BEACH HOUSE - NIGHT \nGrace pulls up in her Camry and gets out. She hears MUSIC coming from inside and hesitates a BEAT before walking nervously onto the porch and KNOCKING. A moment later Gerry appears in the doorway. \nGERRY There she is! Come on in, I'm mixing up some margaronis. We lost our final game, but I got four hits! \nGRACE Oh. Great. Uh, where is everyone? \nGERRY They all went out to party--now get in here! But Grace stays on the porch. \nGRACE Gerry, I'm sorry but I can't stay. \nGERRY What? Grace hasn't been in this situation in a long time and it shows. Gerry steps out onto the porch looking concerned. \nGERRY (CONT'D) Is everything okay? \nGRACE Yeah, yeah, everything's fine, but... (holds up gift box) .I can't accept this. \nGERRY Why not? Grace does a double-take. \nGRACE Gerry, I'm a married woman. Gerry nods at this, maybe a little hurt. She hands him the box and he reluctantly accepts it. \nGERRY Um... I'm sorry if I made you uncomfortable, Grace. It's just that...I really like you. \nGRACE I like you, too, Gerry, and you didn't make me uncomfortable. She smiles at him and he forces a smile back, and there's some serious eye-contact, and then BAM! They DIVE AT EACH OTHER and start SUCKING FACE LIKE THERE'S NO TOMORROW. As they continue to MAUL EACH OTHER, they STUMBLE INTO THE HOUSE, and we \nCUT TO: \nINT. ENTER THE DRAGON NIGHT CLUB - NIGHT \nRick and Leigh are leaning against the bar. \nLEIGH So...you're married? \nRICK I wasn't deliberately hiding it. He holds up his ring hand. \nAUNT MEG Rick, my name's Meg. I'm your babysitter Paige's aunt, and I just wanted to come over here and tell you this: They don't make men like you anymore. She smiles. \nFRED Oh. Well, thank you. \n(BEAT) Would you like to come in? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BALL CLUB BEACH HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA guilt-ridden Grace is just finishing GETTING DRESSED when Gerry comes out of the bathroom buttoning up his shirt. \nGERRY Everything okay? \nGRACE Yeah. Yeah. It's just ...no, everything's not okay. \nGERRY What? He moves close to her and she grows uncomfortable. \nGRACE Look, you're a great cguy, Gerry, and you're very charming and very sweet and the last thing I wanted to do was hurt your feelings, but...well, what,just happened can never happen again. Gerry looks confused. \nGERRY Oh. \nGRACE I know it's probably hard for you to understand but...I love my husband. \nGERRY So? What does that have to do with anything? Fate threw us together and we went with it--isn't that what life's all about? \nGrace looks at him, recognizing the youth and triteness of his words. \nGRACE Not always. \n(BEAT) It wasn't fair to my husband... and it wasn't fair to you because this could never become anything more than just.. .what it was. She looks at him and shrugs apologetically. Gerry BARKS out a LAUGH. \nGERRY I know that. \nGRACE You do? \nGERRY \n(BIG SMILE) Of course I do. Jeez. I mean, no offense, but let's face it, you're a lot older than me. She flinches, a little embarrassed. A quick reality check for Grace. \nGRACE Right. \nGERRY I don't mean that in a bad way. I'm just saying, I didn't think we were going to start dating, you know? Could you imagine the looks we'd get? It'd be like Hugh Hefner and his girlfriends--except in reverse. Gerry CHUCKLES. \nGERRY (CONT'D) You'd be Hugh Hefner. \nGRACE Yeah, I got that part. Gerry looks at his watch. \nGERRY Ooh, I gotta get going. We have kind of a team meeting in like twenty minutes. Gerry sees Grace glance at the clock: 12:15 A.M. \nGERRY CONT'D It's, uh, kind o a tradition that we always get together on the night of the last game. It would probably be uncool if I missed it. \nGRACE You don't have to explain. \nGERRY Seriously, though, thanks for everything--that was awesome. He holds up his hand and she diligently HIGH-FIVES HIM. Then Gerry WALKS OUT THE DOOR. Grace sits there alone for a moment. We PUSH IN ON HER and we hear Gerry's CAR START OUTSIDE, and when Grace STARTS TO CRY, we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThis is a Tudor home in an upscale Brookline neighborhood. We can hear 'Rage Against The Machine' BLASTING from the street. There's thirty or so cars out front and PEOPLE are still arriving. \nINT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SAME \nThe place is JAMMING. It's a nice house but under-furnished in a bachelor pad kind of way. Rick and Leigh are in a corner drinking beers. \nLEIGH I guess I still have a lot to get out of my system before I do the marriage trip. I'm one of those people who wants to try everything once before I die. \nRICK \n(BLURTING OUT) Have you ever been with a married guy? Leigh pauses, but she doesn't flinch. \nLEIGH No. \nRICK Neither have I. Rick winces, but Leigh smiles at him. It's the moment of truth. \nRICK (CONT'D) I'd like to help you take being with a married guy off your list of things to do before you die. \nLEIGH You would? \nRICK Yes. Leigh gets close. \nLEIGH I don't want to be a home-wrecker. \nRICK I've got a one-time pass, remember? \nLEIGH That wasn't just a line? \nRICK Really? So...how's it going? \nBOSHANE Solid. Very solid. \nLEARY We're building mucho momentumo. Baker makes a JERK-OFF MOTION. \nLEARY (CONT'D) \n(ANNOYED) Hey, Baker, a hall pass ain't just about sex, you know. \nBOSHANE That's right. It's about going bowling and, uh, staying up late, and being able to do what you want to do when you want to do it. \nRICK Haven't gotten laid yet, huh? \nBOSHANE \n(DISPIRITED) It's a lot tougher than we thought it would be. Just then Gary comes around a corner. \nGARY Hey, dudes, there's like ten very bangable chicks out on the back deck--let's go! Leary HOLDS UP HIS BEER. \nLEARY To freedom! The guys TAP their beer cups, then EXIT toward the back deck. A dejected and defeated Rick watches them go, then turns and pushes his way through the crowd to the front door. As he OPENS THE DOOR to leave, he finds himself FACE-TO-FACE WITH \nLEIGH. \nLEIGH Hey, where are you going? \nRICK What are you doing...? I thought you'd left. \nLEIGH No. I told you, I just had to talk him off the ledge. I calmed him down and sent him on his way. \nRICK Oh. Uh, great. \nLEIGH So where's that game room? I thought we were gonna play some games. She smiles and takes his hand and as they walk away, we go... \nINT. COAKLEY'S HOUSE - SECOND FLOOR - NIGHT \nRick and Leigh walk down the hall to the game room. He opens the door and flips on the light. THEIR POV - there's a pool table, a few pinball machines, a bar, and a bed. \nLEIGH I'll be right back--I just have to use the bathroom. Rick nods, then watches as Leigh walks off and disappears into the bathroom. He takes a DEEP BREATH. This is it. Just then he hears O.S. LAUGHTER. Rick heads down the hallway and pushes open a door. \nCOAKLEY (O.S.) Hey. REVERSE ANGLE reveals Coakley SITTING ALL ALONE in a small study off the hall. He has a bowl of Cap'n Crunch on his lap and is watching a re-run of The Andy Griffith Show. \nRICK Hey. How come you're not downstairs partying? Coakley gives him a sad, worn-out smile. \nCOAKLEY All partied out, pal. Rick nods, understanding. Coakley LAUGHS once again at the \nTV. \nCOAKLEY (CONT'D) Man, that Barney Fife still kills me. He looks back to Rick. \nCOAKLEY (CONT'D) Hey, I was thinking about this hall- pass business. It's really ironic, isn't it? Rick glances down the hall to see if Leigh has returned. \nRICK How's that? \nCOAKLEY Well think about it. There's two kinds of guys who cheat on their wives: The guy who does it behind her back, and a guy like you who has his wife's permission. \nRICK Well it's not really cheating if I have permission. \nCOAKLEY Yeah, whatever. The point is, if you asked a hundred people who the better CJuy is, ninety-nine of 'em would pick you, because you're being honest--there's no deceit involved. Rick is growing uncomfortable. \nCOAKLEY (CONT'D) But the funny thing is, the other guy, the cheater, the bad guy, he has to live with all that guilt and anxiety, while his wife's running around happy as a clam because she doesn't know anything. And you, the good guy, you've got no guilt at all because you just laid it all on your wife's shoulders. \nRICK Well I didn't really think of it \nLIKE-- \nCOAKLEY It's like she's your guilt Sherpa! Coakley CHUCKLES and Rick deflates. \nCOAKLEY (CONT'D) Funny, huh? \nRICK \n(WEAKLY) Yeah. \nCOAKLEY And that, my friend, is why you are a genius. As Rick lets this all sink in, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nPaige's Aunt Meg is sitting on the couch. Her legs are crossed revealing a lot of skin. Fred hands her a glass of wine and sits beside her. \nFRED Cheers. They CLINK glasses. \nAUNT MEG Rick, I hope you don't mind me tracking you down--Paige told me where you were staying. \nFRED Please. Not at all. \nMAN'S VOICE (V.0.) \n(ON SPEAKERPHONE) Well, would you know where I could find him? This is Sgt. Polisner of the Massachusetts State Police. As Rick grows alarmed, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. RICK & FRED'S HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nFred is still on the couch with Aunt Meg on the floor in front of him. Fred's PANTS ARE DOWN TO HIS ANKLES, leaving him with only his boxers on. Meg KISSES HIS CHEST and STOMACH, then leans back and TAKES OFF HER TANK-TOP, revealing EXTRA-LARGE BAZOOKAS stuffed into a slinky bra. \nAUNT MEG I'm attracted to men with integrity. \nFRED Thanks--wow, you got great jugs. Meg takes Fred's hand and leads him toward the bed (with his pants still at his ankles), Fred WADDLING LIKE A PENGUIN. \nAUNT MEG Moral-guy's a tit-man, huh? \nFRED \n(SHRUGGING) Well, I grew up in the midwest. She pushes him down on the bed and Fred quickly kicks off his pants and shoes (but keeps his boxers on.) Meg TACKLES him and the two of them start to roll around UNDER THE COVERS. An O.S. Fred seems to be working his way down her stomach. \nAUNT MEG Oh yes! Rick... please...I want you to make love to me. Just then Rick BURSTS INTO THE ROOM, out of breath. Fred and Meg come up from under the covers. (Fred is at waist-level on her.) \nRICK Fred, I need to talk to you! Meg GLARES down at Fred, confused. \nAUNT MEG Fred? I thought you were Rick?! \nRICK I'm Rick. Fred cowers guiltily. \nFRED Please don't judge me. As Aunt Meg KARATE KICKS Fred in the face, we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HOLIDAY INN EXPRESS - NIGHT - MOMENTS LATER \nFred, now dressed, hurries across the parking lot with Rick on his heels. Fred has BLOOD-STAINED TISSUE stuffed up his nose. \nFRED What did they tell you? Is Grace gonna be okay? \nRICK All I know is she was in a car accident and they rushed her to the hospital. \nFRED Oh my God... Suddenly they hear O.S. GLASS SHATTERING. They look up and \nREACT. THEIR POV - From fifty yards across the parking lot, they can see that Fred's mini-van's windshield has just been BASHED IN by the BAT-WIELDING Wannabe. On the side of the vehicle is spray-painted: HORNY OLD MAN. \nFRED (CONT'D) Whoa!!! What the hell...?! Wannabe turns to them, a CRAZED LOOK on his face. \nWANNABE How do you like me now, Splenda- boy? \nFRED You moron, that's Lny car! His is the one next to it! Wannabe looks over at Rick's Avalon, PULLS OUT A KNIFE, and quickly SLASHES TWO OF RICK'S TIRES. As Rick and Fred RUN TOWARD HIM, Wannabe JUMPS INTO AN OLD BRONCO and PEELS OUT OF \nTHE PARKING LOT. BACK ON Rick and Fred as they slow down and CATCH THEIR \nBREATHS. \nRICK Nice job, Fred. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nThe mini-van blows by a sign that reads 'CAPE COD - 60 \nMILES.' \nINT. MINI-VAN - SAME \nThe WINDSHIELD IS GONE and the wind blows back Rick and Fred's hair as if they were on a motorcycle. Fred tries his car phone as he drives. \nFRED Oh come on! How can a hospital not have a live operator?! \nRICK It's four in the morning, Fred. Fred hangs up and pounds his steering wheel. \nFRED What was I thinking?! I had a great wife--a beautiful wife--and now I may lose her.. .because of you. \nRICK What are you talking about?! You said our wives were living their dreams, with their fancy gas ovens, and that our dream was the hall pass! How can you blame this on me?! \nFRED I'd never even heard of a hall pass until you flaunted yours in my face! 'Hey, look at me, I've got a hall pass--everyone should have a hall pass!' You ruined my life, Mills! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT \nMaggie and Rick Coleman sit on the back deck DRINKING WINE. \nRICK COLEMAN This is a great place. \nMAGGIE Yeah, my family's had it since I was a kid. We used to come for a week a summer, then two weeks, then a month, then by the time I got to high school we were living here all summer long. \nINT. MINI-VAN - CONTINUOUS \nRICK Oh God, now there's two of 'em! \nFRED I don't care--I'm not stopping 'til we get there! \nRICK Are you crazy?! \nFRED Yeah, I'm crazy! I'm crazy about my wife! \nEXT. CAPE COD HOSPITAL - NIGHT \nRick and Fred come SKIDDING UP to the EMERGENCY ROOM ENTRANCE in the graffitied mini-van. \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS \nThe two Young Cops SCREECH to a stop behind the mini-van as the second cruiser flies up behind them. \nCOP #2 We're on! The officers spring from their cars and quickly TACKLE Fred as he runs toward the front doors. Rick climbs out of the passenger seat with HIS HANDS RAISED. \nRICK Hear me out, gentlemen, I can explain everything! A BURLY OFFICER from the back-up car form-tackles Rick, BLASTING him backwards onto the sidewalk. Fred and Rick manage to roll away and then CRAWL THROUGH THE \nFRONT ENTRANCE. \nINT. HOSPITAL - EMERGENCY ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nOur guys barely get in the door before being PUMMELED TO THE FLOOR by the four cops. The TWO PEOPLE seated in the waiting room STAND UP IN SHOCK and then a swarm of DOCTORS and ORDERLIES come running in to see what the commotion is. \nFRED Grace needs me! Cop #1 PINS FRED'S HEAD TO THE FLOOR as Cop #2 lays across his legs. \nCOP #1 Okay, just take it easy, buddy. \nFRED No, I won't take it easy! Look, I'm sorry I was speeding and I shouldn't have run from you guys, but my wife's been in an accident and she's in this emergency room and I gotta see how she is because... \n(GROWS EMOTIONAL) \n.THAT WOMAN'S MY WHOLE LIFE! The cops look moved and unsure what to do. \nDOCTOR Are you the husband of... (glances down at chart) .Grace Searing? Fred strains to look up. \nFRED Yes! Is she okay?! The Doctor hesitates and the cops look at each other and then the Burly Officer releases Rick from his head-lock. \nBURLY OFFICER All right, let him up. The young officers get off Fred and help him up. Fred rushes to the Doctor, who seems very serious. \nFRED Please tell me she's gonna be okay. \nDOCTOR She is. Your wife broke her nose and she got shaken up a bit, but all in all she's a very lucky woman. \nFRED You got that wrong, doc. I'm the lucky one. Fred is visibly relieved as the doctor smiles and walks off. \nFRED (CONT'D) \n(CALLING OUT) Bless you, doctor! Fred turns to Rick and the two men hug and then Rick grabs Fred by the shoulders and looks him in the eye. \nRICK You take care of that woman, buddy, and I'm gonna go home and take care of mine. Fred nods, emotional, as the cops look at each other, unmoved. Rick starts to walk away. \nFRED Rick... Rick stops and turns at the door. \nFRED (CONT'D) You go love that lady! The Burly Officer rolls his eyes and steps up to Rick. \nBURLY OFFICER Uh, before you 'go love that lady', we're going to have to write you guys up. As the officer pulls out his CITATION PAD, we \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BEACH COTTAGE - NIGHT \nRick pulls up in the wrecked mini-van and gets out. \nINT. BEACH COTTAGE - CONTINUOUS \nRick steps quietly into the house. He sees two empty bottles of wine and two half-filled glasses on the coffee table. Then he hears Maggie's O.S. VOICE coming from the bedroom. \nMAGGIE (O.S.) Oh my god...oh my god...oh my and... ON RICK - he looks concerned as he approaches the bedroom door. \nINT. BEACH COTTAGE - BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nRick ENTERS to find Maggie laying in bed... TALKING ON THE \nPHONE. \nMAGGIE \n(INTO PHONE) Oh my god... oh my god, you poor thing.

But Ed turns THE VOLUME UP. CLOSE ON MONITOR - Rick plays along with a BAD BRITISH \nACCENT. \nRICK (ON MONITOR) Is that so, dear boy? And what happens if you lose power during a big blow and your main generator doesn't kick in? \nFRED (ON MONITOR) Well that's why I had the back-up generator installed in Kimmy's rumpus. Kimmy makes a face, shocked. \nGRACE (under breath; resigned) Here we go... \nINT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS \nRICK Hey, speaking of installations, is that a shiny new set of cans on Mandy Bohac? \nFRED Either that or she's wearing her daughter's t-shirt. \nINT. SAFE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCLOSE ON Mandy's surprised face. She looks at Larry, who's suddenly not so amused. \nINT. STUDY - CONTINUOUS \nRICK They look good but I'll still take the real deal any day. \nFRED Right. You're telling me you'd take Kimmy Long's flapjacks over Mandy's new speedbags? \nRICK That's what I'm telling you. I like boobs with a little mileage on 'em. They're more fun. \nFRED Fun? \nRICK Yeah. You can smoosh 'em, swing 'em, hump 'em, Stretch-Armstrong 'em. \nFRED And what about the proven correlation between floppy boobs and large-mouth vaginas? \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. ED & KIMMY LONG'S ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER \nMaggie and Grace hurry down the front walk trailed by their shell-shocked husbands. A trembling and IRATE Kimmy is held back at the door by Ed and a couple other Guests. \nKIMMY You people are horrible! Horrible! \nED \n(CALLING OUT) I'm very disappointed, gentlemen! \nINT. MINI-VAN - DAY \nNo one speaks. Grace drives and Maggie sits beside her, humiliation etched across their faces. Finally: \nFRED Uh, anyone thinking chocolate chip cookie dough in a waffle cone? Grace YANKS the mini-van to the side of the road and GLARES \nBACK AT HIM. \nGRACE Large-mouth vaginas?! As the guys cower, we \nCUT TO: \nINT. RICK & MAGGIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nRick looks small and weak sitting on the couch while Maggie stands across from him rubbing her temples. It looks like the Norman Rockwell painting where the mom reprimands her little boy for sneaking a frog into the house. \nMAGGIE You know what really troubles me? The thing that you're all so obsessed with is meaningless to you. It's really just about numbers with you guys. Rick looks up, confused. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Rick, you can't even tel me the month you lost your virginity. I can tell you the exact day and hour that I lost mine. Rick seems a little embarrassed by this. \nRICK Well, virginity is different for guys. \nMAGGIE The point is, obviously I like sex, too--it means something to me--but I don't walk around gawking at every guy I see. \nRICK All right, so I occasionally notice other women. I'm sorry. \nMAGGIE Occasionally? Rick rakes his hands through his hair and decides to come clean. \nRICK Okay, you want the truth? You really want me to pull back the curtain here? From the moment I leave the house in the morning 'til the moment I get home, I pretty much notice every woman in my path. Maggie turns to face him. \nRICK (CONT'D) But it's not how you think it is, Mags. It's like... it's like a curse. I don't want to notice, but I can't help it. It's always been like that. I figured that when I c jot married that would be it, but it wasn't--the thing,doesn't give two shits about marriage. \nMAGGIE \n(HURT) So what are you saying--you're not happy with our sex life? Rick reaches up and takes her hand. \nRICK No. Of course I'm happy, honey--our sex life is great--not that I wouldn't mind a little more, but-- look, one thing has nothing to do with the other. I think about sex a lot--all guys do--that's just the way it is. Maggie sits down beside him, clearly at the end of her rope. No one speaks for a few moments. Then: \nMAGGIE I'm giving you a hall pass. \n", "test1_true": "MAGGIE One week off from marriage. \nRICK You mean, like a trial separation? You are seriously overreacting. \nMAGGIE It's not a separation, it's a hall pass. You can do whatever you want. Get it out of your system. \nRICK \n(BEAT) Wait a minute--are you for real? \nMAGGIE It's not a yes or no offer, and it's not a debate. You're getting a hall pass. As Maggie heads upstairs, we PUSH IN on a confused Rick. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. RICK AND MAGGIE'S KITCHEN - MORNING \nMaggie is washing out a pan at the sink when Rick ENTERS dressed for work. We hear the O.S. SOUNDS of The Wiggles coming from a TV in another room. \nRICK 'Morning. \nMAGGIE (not facing him) There's a couple hard-boiled eggs in a bowl there for you. \nRICK I'm gonna have to take them to go, hon, I've got a showing in fifteen minutes. Rick puts the eggs in his pocket, then approaches Maggie and kisses her on the cheek. \nRICK (CONT'D) Hey, about this hall pass business.. .1 don't want it and I don't need it. All I need is-- \nMAGGIE I told you, this isn't negotiable. She turns and faces him. \nRICK You're really serious about this? \nMAGGIE Rick, this isn't something that I...look, I really think you need this. I think we need this. Rick doesn't know what to say. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) This afternoon I'm taking the kids out to my parent's beach house. Rick REACTS to this. \nRICK For how long? \nMAGGIE We'll be back in one week. And as far as I'm concerned, starting right now. .. you have the week off from marriage. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - DAY \nThis is a big shiny place. All fixed-up. Fred pulls up in his mini-van and gets out. He walks past a Coldwell Banker For Sale sign with Rick's name on it. \nINT. VICTORIAN HOUSE - SAME \nRick is showing the kitchen to a COUPLE, mid-40's, when Fred \nENTERS. \nRICK Hey, what are you doing here? \nFRED I called your office and they told me you were in the neighborhood. Rick turns to the couple. \nRICK Oh, this is a friend of mine, Fred Searing. Fred, this is Harold and Nancy Goldberg--they're moving up here from Long Island. \nFRED Well, mazel tov, folks. The Goldbergs look at Fred a little warily as he takes out a card. \nFRED (CONT'D) Here, let me give you my card. Home, auto, or life insurance--I'm the go-to mensch in town. \nHAROLD GOLDBERG We're good on insurance. Rick quickly jumps in. \nRICK (to the Goldbergs) Uh, why don't you two take another look around and if you have any questions I'll be right here. \nHAROLD GOLDBERG Thank you. The Goldbergs walk out and Rick closes the door behind them. \nRICK \n(HUSHED) What the he 1 are you doing--I'm trying to make a sale here. \nFRED You weren't picking up your cell--I wanted to see how much trouble you got in last night. You know what Grace made me do? She made me call the Longs and apologize. Rick flinches. \nRICK Oof . \nFRED How 'bout you--did Maggie freak out when you got home? \nRICK Uh... sort of. Rick peeks out the kitchen door to make sure the Goldberg's aren't listening. Then: \nRICK (CONT'D) She gave me a hall pass. \nFRED A what? \nRICK A week off from marriage to do whatever I want. She's going to her parents' house down the Cape 'til next Sunday. Fred SNICKERS. \nFRED Yeah, right. \n", "test2_input": "RICK You don't even have a hall pass. \nHOG-HEAD So? I can still live vicariously through you guys, can't I? \nRICK It's not vicarious if you're actually doing it. \nHOG-HEAD Whatever. Just hit your ball. Hog-Head takes ANOTHER BITE. \nFRED Oh, what the hell, it's not like my game can get any worse. \nRick watches Fred pick up a brownie and TENTATIVELY TASTE IT. Then Gary INHALES HIS IN ONE BITE. \nRICK All right, give me one of those things. As Rick drops his club and walks toward the brownies, we \nSUPER: \n75 MINUTES LATER \nEXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY \nA dazed and confused Rick and Fred are RECLINING in their cart in the middle of the fairway. For a while neither of them speak. Then: \nFRED What kind of soap do you use? \nRICK \n(BEAT) You mean in the shower? \nFRED Yeah. \nRICK Dove. \nFRED Yeah, I like Dove--it doesn't dry your skin so much. Fred stares into space. \nFRED (CONT'D) Sometimes it's hard to wash off, though. Because of the moisturizer. You ever notice--? \nRICK I think Hog-head's dead. Fred looks over and sees Hog-head SPRAWLED OUT ON HIS BACK IN A SAND TRAP. He's not moving. \nFRED \n(CALLING OUT) Hog-head...? Are you okay? As Hog-head starts to make SNOW ANGELS IN THE SAND, an elderly COURSE RANGER pulls up in a golf cart. \nRANGER What the hell is he doing? Rick and Fred grow visibly tense at the sight of an authority figure. \nRICK Uh, he's having back spasms. \nRANGER Not him. Him. Rick and Fred turn and see Gary STANDING CHEST-DEEP in the MIDDLE OF A POND just STARING AT THEM. \nRICK \n(CALLING OUT) Gary! What are you doing?! \nGARY I don't know--you tell me! Gary starts to LAUGH MANIACALLY. The Ranger turns to Rick, annoyed. \nRANGER Look, this is the third time I've had to flag your group and you're only on the fourth hole. Now if I have to come out here again, you're done for the day. \nRICK Gotcha. We'll pick it up, sir.

Where did you last see it? \nGARY On the course. \nRICK Where on the course? \nGARY I don't know--on a fairway, I think. I clot out, grabbed my club, took a swing, and when I turned around it had disappeared. \nRICK You're serious? You're telling us you lost your golf cart? \nFRED \n(STONER VOICE) Dude, where's my golf cart? \nRICK Shut up, Fred. \nHOG-HEAD Guys, I gotta go poo again. \nGARY I didn't lose it, I think it was stolen. \n", "test2_true": "(ANNOYED) Who would steal a golf cart? Gary shrugs. \nGARY Criminals? \nHOG-HEAD Does anyone have any napkins? \nGARY Look, all I know is I had it on the seventh tee and now it's gone. \nRICK What are you talking about? We're only on the sixth hole. \nGARY What? Did we miss a hole? Where's my kids? Rick closes his eyes and rubs his head, trying to keep it together. Then he NOTICES something O.S.. \nRICK Oh, come on, man! ANOTHER ANGLE REVEALS Hog-head down in a greenside bunker PULLING UP HIS PANTS. As he starts to KICK SAND over his O.S. POOP like a cat in its litter box, we HEAR a noise and the guys look up. THEIR POV - the Golf Ranger comes flying over a hill heading straight for them. \nFRED Run for it! The guys run toward Rick's cart, jump in, and take off. Rick and Fred are in the seats, while Gary and Hog-head HANG OFF THE BACK. The cart BARRELS down a cart path with the Ranger \nHOT IN PURSUIT. \nGARY He's gaining on us! \nRICK I can't go any faster, I've got it floored! \nFRED Cut through the woods! Without slowing down, Rick TURNS SHARPLY TO THE RIGHT and Gary and Hog-head TUMBLE OUT OF THE CART. With panic etched across their sweaty faces, Gary and Hog- head quickly jump to their feet and run after the cart. Rick slows just enough for them to catch up and jump back on, then he speeds down a maintenance path and DISAPPEARS INTO THE \nWOODS. \nEXT. SIDEWALK CAFE - DAY \nEd and Kimmy Long are sitting at an outside table having lunch with their two young children.

The BATTER HITS A ROPE TO RIGHT FIELD, and as the TYING and WINNING RUNS SCORE the PLACE GOES WILD. \nSAME SCENE - LATER The PLAYERS and FANS mingle on the field immediately after the game. \nGrace and Maggie stand near the pitcher's mound as they watch Maggie's kids run the bases. The wives look TANNED and REFRESHED from several days laying on the beach. Just then a big, goofy kid named GERRY approaches. He's a strapping 22-year-old first baseman from Puerto Rico with a perpetual SHIT-EATING GRIN. \nGERRY Hey, I'm Gerry--thanks for coming out and supporting us. \nMAGGIE Oh, it was fun. You guys looked good. \nGERRY Thanks. Gerry glances back at his TEAMMATES who are clearly egging him on. \nGERRY (CONT'D) So...we saw you sitting up there with those little kids--are you nannies or something? The girls aren't immune to flattery and they smile. \nMAGGIE No, they're my kids. \nGERRY \n(DUBIOUS) Yeah, right. You have three kids? \nMAGGIE Uh-huh.

ANGLE ON two pretty LATINO WOMEN sitting alone at a table. \nFRED Ooh, yeah. Daddy likes. Fred pulls a piece of paper out of his back pocket and hands it to Rick. \nRICK What's this? \nFRED I went on-line this afternoon and wrote down some good pick-up lines to break the ice. \nRICK \n(READING) 'Hi. Will you help me find my puppy? I think he ran into the cheap hotel across the street.' \nFRED That's a good one--except for one thing: We don't have a puppy, so when she gets there she'll realize we're full of shit. Rick shoots him a look. \nRICK I don't think it's supposed to be for real. It's just to make her laugh so she'll talk to you. Fred considers this. \nFRED Oh God no, it doesn't work on that level. Here, this is my favorite. He takes the paper from Rick. \nFRED (CONT'D) \n(READING) 'You must be from Ireland because when I look at you my penis is Dublin.' \nRICK It's a charmer but you know what? We don't need phony pick-up lines. Why don't we just be ourselves? \nFRED Great. If you know how to. Rick takes a DEEP BREATH and braces himself. \nRICK Give me the helmet. Fred hands him the helmet, then Rick marches up to the two Latino Women with the helmet under his arm and Fred close on his heels. \nRICK (CONT'D) Hi. The women give him a pleasant look. \nLATINO WOMAN #1 Hello. Fred gives a little wave from behind Rick. \nFRED Hola. LONG BEAT as Rick tries to figure what to say next. Then: \nRICK Well.. .this is awkward. I feel like I'm back at my first junior high school mixer. \nRick and Fred force a LAUGH and the girls smile. Another LONG, UNCOMFORTABLE BEAT. Rick clears his throat. \nRICK CONT'D) So...are you ladies from Ireland? \nLATINO WOMAN #2 No. \nRICK. I'm very surprised to hear that news, because when I look at you my penis doubles in size. The women FLINCH at this, losing their smiles. Fred leans in. \nFRED No, he means his dick is Dublin. Like the city. In Ireland. As the girls turn away from them, we begin a...

We should be drinking! \nRICK You're right. We're too stiff. \nFRED Way too stiff. We gotta start pounding 'em, get those creative juices flowing, bring the soul to the surface.

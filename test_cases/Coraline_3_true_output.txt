Coraline falls the very bottom of the web. 
Fifty feet above, the Beldam LAUGHS MANIACALLY and LEAPS DOWN like a huge, flying spider! 
Coraline manages to pull herself to the outside of the trap JUST AS THE BELDAM LANDS. 
The witch - furious her prey has escaped - spins around, grasping blindly. 
BELDAM (CONT'D) Noo!! Where are you? You selfish brat!! 
Coraline, nearing the top, looks up and spots the LITTLE DOOR, still in the corner wall of the Other Living Room. She goes to climb back inside the web, when her bag GETS CAUGHT on a barb. She pulls and pulls until it breaks free, sending a STRONG VIBRATION DOWN THE SPIRALING WEB 
TO THE VERY SENSITIVE HAND OF THE BELDAM. 
BELDAM (CONT'D) Hahahaha... 
The Beldam smiles - she knows where her prey is now! 
Coraline makes it to the little door, but the BELDAM IS 
COMING UP BEHIND HER VERY FAST! 
BELDAM (O.S.) (CONT'D) 
YOU ... DARE ... 
INT. PASSAGEWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Coraline SCRAMBLES through the door, KEY IN HAND, and grabs the door's handle. Before she can shut it, the 
BELDAM'S HEAD THRUSTS INSIDE. 
BELDAM 
... DISOBEY YOUR MOTHER??!! 
Coraline KICKS HER IN THE FACE, knocking her back. The cat takes off down the tunnel. 
Coraline nearly shuts the door, when NEEDLE FINGERS GRAB HOLD THROUGH THE CRACK. The door STARTS TO PULL OPEN! 
CORALINE 
PLEASE...SHUT!! 
The ghost children's FLUTTERY, DISMEMBERED HANDS FLY OUT FROM HER BAG and GRAB HOLD OF CORALINE'S HANDS that grip the door's handle. And her STRENGTH IS QUADRUPLED. 
The door STARTS TO SHUT. The Beldam SNATCHES DESPERATELY at Coraline, reaching through the closing gap with one thin claw. There's a final moment of resistance - the Beldam's wire-thin wrist caught in the door - and then SNAP! The DOOR SHUTS, and the Beldam's hand drops to the ground! 
She SCREECHES like a metal rake on pavement! 
Coraline just manages to lock the door in the dark when it is POUNDED from the other side, green light coming through cracks! She takes off down the tunnel, stooped down, as fast as she can. 
The pounding grows more insistent, green light flashing. 
BELDAM (O.S.) 
DON'T LEAVE ME! DON'T LEAVE ME!!! I'LL 
DIE WITHOUT YOU!!!! 
And then the tunnel behind coraline STARTS TO GROW SHORTER, like a collapsing accordion and the pounding far door with the blind, one-handed Beldam on the other side 
STARTS TO CATCH UP TO HER! 
Ahead, DAYLIGHT APPEARS, and then the LITTLE DOOR TO THE 
REAL WORLD! 
INT. REAL LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Coraline FLINGS HERSELF through the doorway, SHUTS AND LOCKS THE DOOR and BRACES HERSELF AGAINST IT. A split- second later, the OTHER WORLD DOOR CATCHES UP WITH A CRASH! Coraline is THROWN BACK. But the real-world door and lock, hold. It's over... 
Coraline lies on her back, as beat-up and tired as she's ever been, GULPING in breaths of air till her heart slows a little. The room is brightly lit by sunlight, the first since she moved here, and the sky out the windows is blue with white clouds. 
She smiles, remembering, and turns to her bag with the ghost eyes and snow globe with her parents inside. 
She opens it up, and searches, shoving aside ghost eyes and garden shears. But the snow globe is GONE! 
She gets on all fours, starts searching the floor. Her hand hits a small PUDDLE by the fireplace, with tiny bits of BLUE SNOW. A drip plops down, then another. She looks up to the mantel and spots the MISSING SNOW GLOBE. She stands up and finds that it's BROKEN OPEN, and neither her parents or the fountain bears are inside. 
As the last of the snowy liquid drains from the globe, Coraline's face clouds with confusion and fear: What does this mean and where are her parents? Then her WONDERFULLY REAL MOTHER calls to her. 
MEL (O.S.) Coraline? We're home! 
Her TRUE PARENTS enter the room from the hallway, a dusting of snow on their shoulders and hair. 
CORALINE Mom! Dad! I missed you so much! 
Coraline runs to her parents and throws her arms around them. 
MEL Missed us? 
C.U. ON CORALINE. Huh? 
Mel notices the broken snow globe.

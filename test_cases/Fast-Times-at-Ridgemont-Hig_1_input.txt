ANGLE ON MIKE DAMONE 
in another part of the dance, by the Junior class sponsored food counter. Damone is standing, talking to several girls, gesturing and being Damone, Mr. Attitude. 
DAMONE Sign my annual, honey. 
The girls look at each other, laugh. They walk away. 
ANGLE ON THE RAT 
standing nearby. 
THE RAT You're losing it, Damone. 
DAMONE You're crazy. Those girls love me. 
ANGLE ON JEFF SPICOLI 
sprawled out in the bleachers with his surfer stoner buddies. He turns to one admiring stoner (Todd). 
SPICOLI Hey, mon. Sign my annual. 
Spicoli slips the annual into the kid's crotch. The stoner winces in pain, but still opens the book and lingers on all the signings in Spicoli's annual. They are all drug-related messages from fellow stoners. After a moment, Spicoli's friend signs: "Thanks for the reds. Todd." 
TODD Hey, mon, good thing we're going to Mexico this summer. 'Cause you're gonna get kicked out of your house when your parents read your annual. 
INT. GYMNASIUM - ANGLE ON DOOR 
Brad Hamilton pushes both doors open, and makes his entrance into the Last Dance. There is a lot of activity going on, but all nearby eyes turn to Brad as he walks into the dance. Fifteen kids immediately gravitate towards him. They all want Brad to sign their annuals, to talk about the 7-11 incident. Onstage, the T-Birds play the Beatles' "It Won't Be Long". 
We see Brad's old girlfriend Lisa push up to him. Her new jock boyfriend holds a protective arm around her. 
LISA I saw your picture in the paper. You had the greatest look on your face! 
ANOTHER STUDENT Front of the Metro Section. I'm telling my parents, 'I know this guy, I know this guy.' 
Lisa's boyfriend pulls his arm tighter around her. 
LISA Will you sign my annual, Brad? 
Brad smiles, nods. He signs, and gives her his. We then see Brad's three Buddies from Carl's Jr. come up, pat him on the back and grab his shoulder. Brad studies them warily. 
BUDDY #1 Fuckin' manager of 7-11! 
BUDDY #2 Get us jobs over there, Brad! You can do it! 
BRAD Since when do you guys want to work at 7-11? 
BUDDY #2 Come on, Brad! It would be great! All of us together! 
BRAD Well, 7-11 is a tremendous operation. It's really changed, man. They've got great food, great magazines, videogames... it's class. Total class. 
BUDDY #3 As soon as you can get us in there, we're gone from Carl's, Brad. 
BUDDY #2 Yeah, man, all the little punks from junior high have taken over the place. 
Brad leaves his old buddies. He grins and notices someone across the crowded dance floor. 
BRAD Hey, Thompson! Wendell! Get a job! 
They laugh, flip him off. Brad is back in his element at last. He moves into the main dancing area, works his way across the room, past the bleachers, when he hears a voice. 
SPICOLI (O.S.) Hamilton! 
Brad turns around, seen Spicoli sitting on the bottom rung of the bleachers. Spicoli looks back with true respect. 
SPICOLI (CONT'D) Awesome. 
He throws Brad his annual. Brad gives him his. They sign. 
SPICOLI (CONT'D) Easy, mon. 
BRAD Later. 
ANGLE ON THE BLEACHERS 
where several couples are passionately making out. Four teachers clomp up into the stands from different angles. They pin the couples in flashlight beams, like the main tower pinning an escaping prisoner. 
ANGLE ON THE T-BIRDS 
onstage, singing the Rolling Stones' "I'm Free". 
EXT. GYNMASIUM - NIGHT 
We see Jeff Spicoli leave the dance and come backing down the stairs with a stoner bud. His fist is in the air. 
SPICOLI Summer, mon! We're there!

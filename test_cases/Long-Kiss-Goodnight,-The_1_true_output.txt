A pause. Then: 
NATHAN You don't know your name. 
He chews his lower lip, mind racing. Jesus, no joke, this is *her*... He fights to control his voice: 
NATHAN Your full name... is Charlene Elizabeth Baltimore. 
INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - SAME TIME 
A MAN in shirtsleeves flips a switch. Speaks into a headset: 
MAN Signal Daedalus. We just got her, she made contact. Initiating phone trace. 
INT. HOUSE - BACK WITH NATHAN 
NATHAN Charly, don't talk, just listen: We have to meet, understand? We have to meet *right away*. 
SAMANTHA (O.S.) Meet me off I-79. Highmile exit, Salt & Pepper Lounge. Eleven a.m. 
She hangs up. Nathan stares, trembling. Turns to ALICE, standing in the doorway. Swallows hard, says: 
NATHAN A former student... is in trouble. 
INT. RESTAURANT BATHROOM - WITH CHARLY 
She hangs up the telephone in the ladies' room. Stands, alone in the stillness. Hands to her head, mind churning... 
Turns, checks to make sure the door is locked. Props her SUITCASE on the sink and opens it. Flips back the mound of clothing -- 
And there it is. The pieces, disassembled, of an M-40 sniper rifle. Her trembling hands find the parts, seemingly of their own volition... Hefting them. Gauging their feel. And then, slowly... terrifyingly... 
Knowing how they go together. She SNAPS the barrel in place, *click*-! The sound breaks her reverie. She drops the thing like it's alive. Looks down, trembling... 
ALSO in the case: a wicked looking HUNTING KNIFE. She picks it up gingerly. Shiny, brand new. Turns it over in her hand, fascinated by the play of light off the blade... 
Looks up. Her REFLECTION, in the mirror. Staring back. She frowns -- It frowns. She turns away -- 
THE REFLECTION DOESN'T. It stays right fucking put, except now it's *smiling*. Malignant. Deadly. Sam feels something wrong. Spins back toward the mirror -- 
Her reflected arm comes through the looking glass. Reaches into Sam's world and SLICES FOR HER THROAT. 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DRIVING - LATE AFTERNOON 
Samantha JERKS, comes awake in the passenger seat of Henessey's Plymouth. Bad dream. Looks over to see if he noticed -- he's honking his horn at a TRAFFIC JAM. Sea of taillights, dead ahead. 
SAMANTHA What's this? What the hell is this...? We don't have time for this, of all the cocksucking bullshit -- 
HENESSEY Whoa. Ms. Class, drive a little truck on the side, do you? 
SAMANTHA What are you, a Mormon? 
HENESSEY No, ma'am, it's just that... well, when we met you're all, "Oh, fooey, I burned the darn cupcakes." Now, you go into a bar, ten minutes later sailors come running out, they can't take it. 
Just then, THREE POLICE CRUISERS blow by, sirens screaming. Henessey frowns, puzzled. 
HENESSEY What the hell...? Lemme check the scanner. 
He switches on a police band radio. Listens, hears: 
VOICE (O.S.) ...without endangering the hostages, over... ...Roger that two-niner. PCP confirmed, he's on a fuse, please provide backup, over... ...Conneaut, I'm waiting on Special Weapons, sorry, over... 
EXT. ROADSIDE DINER - CONNEAUT LAKE, PA. - SAME 
POLICE FLASHERS, spinning. Cop cars, incoming. SLAMMING to a halt. Disgorging uniformed cops. THE DINER is rapidly surrounded. Its a cheery decor, the giant roofbound Santa, all in stark contrast -- To the SCREAMING we hear, dimly, from within. 
INT. DINER - SAME 
Hostage drama, unfolding. The perp's a big ugly meatloaf with his mitts on a waitress. She's sixteen, she's a baby. She's sucking the barrel of his shotgun. His finger on the trigger. From outside, we hear the COPS: 
COP VOICE (O.S.) GIVE YOURSELF UP AT ONCE. LEAVE THE BUILDING, HANDS ON HEAD. DROP THE WEAPON, REPEAT, DROP THE WEAPON. 
Mr. Shotgun snorts laughter. Does a little dance, yells: 
MR. SHOTGUN I'm the man! I'm the man! I elicit the explicit! 
EXT. DINER - SAME TIME 
The police are just starting to re-route traffic. A highway cop signals to HENESSEY, "Turn around, go back." 
INT. CAR - SAME TIME 
Henessey swears. Swings wide, when suddenly a HAND clutches his arm. He looks over and suppresses a shiver -- Samantha's eyes have gone dead and cold. She lights a cigarette, shakes out the match and says: 
SAMANTHA Go up this hill. 
HENESSEY Why? 
SAMANTHA *Drive up the fucking hill*.

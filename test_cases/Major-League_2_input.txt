SHOOTING DRAFT 
FADE IN: TITLES APPEAR ON BLACK B.G. 
TITLES END and we WIDEN to reveal that the black b.g. is actually the sludge-clogged surface of the Cuyahoga River. We TILT UP from the river to reveal the city of Cleveland, then follow with a series of shots of Cleveland landmarks. 
INT. THE INJUN DINER - DAY 
Three men in Cleveland Indian baseball caps sit at the counter. BOBBY JAMES, 22-year-old grad student, VIC BOLITO, 30-year-old telephone worker, and JOHNNY WYNN, 45-year-old house painter. THELMA GORDON, 65-year-old waitress, delivers their breakfast. 
THELMA Spring training starts the twelfth. How do you think the Indians will do this year? 
VIC They don't look too good. 
The other two shake their heads in contemplation of this sorry fact. 
INT. MEN'S CLUB - DAY 
A 45-year-old BUSINESS EXECUTIVE is talking to a fellow club member over lunch. 
BUSINESS EXECUTIVE They don't look particularly good, do they? 
EXT. CLEVELAND DOCKS - DAY 
Two LONGSHOREMEN are talking while they unload a freighter. 
LONGSHOREMEN I'll tell ya. They don't look very fuckin' good. 
EXT. CLEVELAND MUNICIPAL STADIUM - DAY 
Down on the field, two KOREAN GROUNDSKEEPERS speak Korean as they resod the outfield. 
GROUNDSKEEPER (in subtitles) They're shitty. 
We TILT UP from the field to a glass-enclosed area on the third deck. 
INT. GLASS-ENCLOSED AREA - DAY 
It's the Cleveland Indians' conference room. Three men are seated around the table; CHARLIE DONOVAN. the manager, PHIL BUTLER, public relations head, JERRY SIMMONS, operations director and LYLE MATTHEWS director of player personnel Donovan taps his pencil impatiently, obviously waiting for somebody. 
DONOVAN (checking his watch) Thirty minutes late. Think she'll show? 
MATTHEWS She's got to. She's the damn owner now. 
DONOVAN She didn't last week. She was having a guava facial. 
As Butler tries to figure out what a guava facial is, the conference room doors swing open and a muscular MALE SECRETARY- BODYGUARD enters, clearing the way for MRS. RACHEL PHELPS, a flashy, striking woman in her early forties. Despite the designer clothes she favors, there is the hint of something less refined about her. She carries a Pekinese dog, CHA-CHA on her left hip. 
RACHEL Good morning, gentlemen. Welcome to another season of Indians' baseball. 
The men applaud, but their hearts are barely in it. The Secretary-Bodyguard pulls out a chair at the head of the table and Rachel sits. 
RACHEL I know that it may not seem the same without Donald here this year, but I promise you by the end of the season this team will have made history. 
Several eyes roll up around the room. 
RACHEL (picking up a newspaper) Unfortunately there are some in the press who feel that... (reading from the page) "the ex-showgirl wife of Donald Phelps has no business being the owner of a major league baseball team." 
Rachel crumbles the paper and throws it away. 
RACHEL Obviously, Donald didn't feel that way or he wouldn't have left the team to me. And I was more than showgirl. I was a dancer. Now, I know some of you have doubts about my ability to run this franchise. God help you if I ever find out about it. 
This causes a few nervous glances in the room. 
RACHEL Spring training begins in two weeks. (throwing a sheet of paper on the table) Here's the list of people we'll be inviting to camp this year. 
Donovan, Butler and Simmons pour over the list. 
RACHEL I could sit here and tell you what a great year we're gonna have, but the facts are we lost the two best players we had to free agency. We haven't won a pennant in 30 years. We haven't even finished in the first division for 15. Obviously it's time to make some changes. What do ya think? 
SIMMONS I never heard of half these guys. And the ones I do know are way past their prime. 
DONOVAN Most of these guys never had a prime. 
BUTLER (pointing to the sheet) This guy here is dead. 
RACHEL Cross him off then. 
BUTLER (under his breath) Let's not be hasty.

{"test1_input": "DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nOver Mrs. Stephens' shoulder WE SEE the party in progress. The glass by her side is full again. Tony is dancing with an attractive blonde. \nMRS. STEPHENS Tony! \nHe turns round. \nTONY Me, Mrs. Stephens? \nThe head nods. \nTony advances reluctantly towards her. \nREVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. \nOver Tony's shoulder WE SEE a powerfully built and once lovely woman. \nShe is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober. The few movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give nothing away. The voice articulates so carefully that the slur scarcely shows. \nThe fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the fact that she is drunk. Her sightless eyes stare out the camera as Tony reaches her. \nMRS. STEPHENS I want a word with you. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen's eyes. The light from the projector flickering into them. \nHELEN I hate people who chatter in films - but there's so much I want to ask. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK \nINT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT \nShe is leaning forward, her face cupped in her hand, watching the small screen intently. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. His face is cupped in his hand as he watches her intently. \nOver Helen's shoulder WE SEE Mark in the making. \nThe child is again asleep... this time he is being photographed from the head of the bed - the CAMERA POINTING STRAIGHT DOWN AT HIS FACE. \nA beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes, first onto the left, then onto the right. \nHELEN (in a whisper) Again? \nMark looks at her in silence. \nThe boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face, pulling the bedclothes round him. His right hand is limp on the pillow. The light shines for a moment on this hand, then goes out.  Helen half turns towards Mark. \nHELEN Mark, this isn't some kind of jo... \nHer attention is suddenly riveted on the screen. \nMARK (in a whisper) No, Helen. \nOver Helen's shoulder WE SEE something drop onto the child's bed... something which stays quite still for a moment, then starts crawling towards the counterpane. It is a small lizard. \nHELEN Mark, whatever is that? \nHer voice trails away. She stares - repelled and fascinated - at the screen. \nWE SEE Mark reach for his cine-camera. \nOver Helen's shoulder WE SEE the lizard reach the counterpane. It stretches itself out on the floral design - its body is pointed towards the child's hand. \nWE HEAR a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto Helen's face. \nOVERLAID is the GENTLE PURRING of Mark's cine-camera. She wheels towards him - blotting out the small screen. \nHELEN What are you... \nMARK wanted to photograph you... watching... \nHELEN No, Mark! \nThe camera purrs on. \nHELEN No! \nHe switches off the spot... the purring of the camera dies away. She turns towards the small screen. \nHELEN help me to understand this... this nightmare... \nThe small boy is sitting upright... screaming with terror... there is no sign of the lizard. \nA handkerchief is thrown onto the boy's bed. He continues crying - looking up into someone's face. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark watching the screen. \nWe hear a man's deep voice overlaid. \nMAN'S DEEP VOICE (O.S.) That'll do Mark... dry your eyes and stop being silly. \nSmall Mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his eyes... his hands are trembling. \nThe small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve. \nHelen turns to Mark. \nHELEN All right... now look... Mark - what was all that about? \nHe looks at her helplessly. \nHELEN ... that was a lizard, wasn't it? Or a... \nMARK Liz... \nHELEN Well how did it get there?... How did it get there Mark?...  Was it a pet? \nMARK Not mine... \nHELEN Won't you try to explain? \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at the screen. \nMARK You'd better go! \nHELEN I like to understand what I'm shown! \nShe turns to the screen. \nHELEN What was your father trying to do?... Photographing you at nigh... \nHer voice trails away. \nMARK better go... \n", "test1_true": "Small Mark is wearing a dark suit and a black tie. \nHe is standing at the foot of a four-poster bed, staring at something in horror and disbelief... his hands clasp the bedrail tightly. \nSlowly - very slowly - he walks towards the head of the bed, staring. \nHis lips begin to quiver. He bends forward over the bed. WE CAN SEE the back of his bowed head. \nHELEN Mark... what is this? \nMARK I am saying... goodbye... my mother... \nWe catch a glimpse of a woman's hands folded in front of her. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen. \nHELEN (in a whisper) He... photographed... that...? \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK Yes. \nSuddenly - and healthily - his temper snaps. \nMARK ...and this! \nHe pushes a lever on his projector as far forward as it will go. \nThe film is now shown at tremendous speed - We catch a glimpse of a long line of cars. \nMARK ...her funeral! \nIt speeds by. \nMARK ...and this! \nA confused picture of earth and flowers. \nMARK ...her burial! \nThe briefest glimpse of a little boy with a spade. \nMARK ...and this! \nWE SEE a girl in a bikini by sand-dunes. Mark offers no comment. \nHELEN Mark, who is that? \nMARK Her successor. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen. \nHELEN Suc-? \nMARK He married her... six weeks after... the previous sequence. \nHe pulls back the lever of his projector... the film returns to its normal speed. \nWE SEE the same attractive young woman standing in a garden. She is holding a bewildered and defiant Mark by the hand. \nSuddenly the girl runs towards camera - leaving Mark standing alone. \nMARK She filmed... what comes now. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen watching intently.  It's out of focus! \nFrom Helen's POV WE SEE a tall man in a black coat walking away from camera. He hurries towards small Mark - who watches him anxiously. \nHELEN Is that your father? \nMARK The morning that he left for his honeymoon. \nThe back of Mark's father suddenly obscures our view of small Mark... all we can see is that tall figure looking downwards standing very still. \nCamera wobbles - as if the person holding it is laughing. \nHELEN What is he doing? \nMARK Giving me a present... \nHELEN What was it? \nMark stares at the blurred screen, perspiration trickling down his forehead. \nMARK Can't you guess? \nThe small screen comes back into focus - and suddenly our camera rushes towards it. \nWE SEE a CLOSE SHOT of a CLOSE SHOT - and at the moment we see it, Mark's Voice is overlaid... A whisper which echoes round the room. \nMARK (O.S.) A camera... \nWe are looking at a close shot of a camera in a small boy's hands. \nThere is a single shrill chord of music on the sound track. \nCLOSE SHOT of the shelf which encircles Mark's room. \nWe are looking at the very same camera which the small boy is holding. \nCLOSE SHOT of the camera in small Mark's hands. \nHis father's finger points lo the view-finder. \nSmall Mark stares into it. Small Mark begins to smile. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark watching himself being born. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen watching Mark. \nHELEN Switch it off! \nHe continues to stare at the screen. \nHELEN Switch it off, Mark! \nShe turns to the projector - touches the wrong switch. \nSmall Mark and his father go rapidly backwards. \nMark turns off the projector abruptly. \nThe room is in darkness. \nWE CAN HEAR both of them breathing quickly. \nThe light goes on. Mark is standing by the exit - he keeps his face averted. \n", "test1_id": 405, "test2_input": "VIVIAN Now listen... they're working late on the lot. \nMARK I know. They're branched off this stage - I'm using their juice. \nHe nods, staring at her intently. \nVIVIAN We must call it off... someone's bound to see us. \nMARK They might... (rising slowly) ... but they won't interrupt us while we're filming... I've put the red light on. \nINT. ENTRANCE TO SET - EARLY EVENING \nCLOSE SHOT of the red light - burning. \nCLOSE SHOT of Vivian. \nINT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING \nVIVIAN You've what?... \nMARK Put the... \nVIVIAN Then they'll know someone's here. \nMARK They won't come in. \nVIVIAN They'll wait outside... what's the difference? \nMARK The difference is... a perfect film... \nOver his shoulder WE SEE the studio camera. \nMARK ... have waited... a long time... for this... and so have you ... no one... must interrupt it. \nShe glances round at the brazenly burning lights; shakes her head despairingly. \nVIVIAN We'll be caught. \nMARK What does that matter? \nVIVIAN Matter! \nMARK You stand to lose... a job as an extra... I stand to lose... nothing. \nShe looks at him in silence. \nMARK ...the results must be so perfect... that the risks don't count... \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK So perfect... that even he ... (he hesitates) ... even he... would say... \nVIVIAN Who Don Jarvis!? \nHe looks at her, then nods. \nVIVIAN Oh! He'd say: (imitating the great man's voice) Sign on the dotted line, kiddies! You can use my pen, but bring your own ink! (her excitement is growing) Mark... if you're sure it's worth it? \nMARK It's time to find out, Viv... \nHe walks slowly towards the studio camera. \nShe prepares for the test by switching on music and warming up with dance movements. \nVIVIAN Come on! Get hot! (she accents the rhythm) \nMark puts the cine-camera and the black cloth bag on the dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp - and swings the camera. \nWe watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of the studio, from the Director's chair. And finally WE WATCH HIM from Vivian's POV. She stops dancing but the music continues. \nMARK You belong there... \nHe stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away... then bends and looks into the finder. \nThere is a single harsh chord of music - and the screen goes dark. It remains dark for a moment. \nSuddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the centre WE SEE Vivian's face in the finder of the studio camera. (Unlike the ground-glass of the newsagent's camera, we see everything the right way up and in perfect perspective.) \nMark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches it on. He adjusts the finder until he has made of Vivian's delicate features a radiant miniature. \nThe miniature smiles shyly at him. She has stopped dancing and is looking directly at the camera. Music continues. \nVIVIAN I do feel alone in front of it... (she hesitates) I suppose stars never do? \nMARK They feel alone without it... (he looks in the eyepiece) \nThrough the film, we can see only her eyes - large and wistful. \nMARK ... and the great ones... feel alone... all the time... \nShe becomes the uninhibited Vivian again. \nVIVIAN Then I'm great, boy! What is it you want me to act? (she strikes an attitude a, la Rabbins) \nHe looks up from the camera; she smiles and starts keeping time to the rhythm again. \nVIVIAN Being frightened to death? \nMARK You remembered? \nVIVIAN Yes - and I'll have a go! \nWe hear his quick breathing. \nVIVIAN I've been wondering all the afternoon how you'd do it!  I'll bet you've thought of a wonderful twist! (she does a wonderful twist) \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks down - a little sadly - and peers into the finder. (The camera dolly is on tracks - he tracks forward.) \nMusic continues - piano. \nIn the finder WE SEE a large trunk - 'at greatly reduced prices' \u0097 on the shelf behind Vivian. \nFrom Vivian's POV WE SEE Mark leave the studio camera \u0097 and hurry towards the trunks. She watches him wide-eyed. \nVIVIAN What are you doing? \nMARK Building us a set. \nHe reaches for the largest trunk. \nVIVIAN Why not pull the studio down while you're about it? They can only hang you once. \nMARK Exactly. \nHe carries the trunk towards the studio camera, and lays it carefully on the floor. \nMusic continues. \nVivian peers into the front-glass of the studio camera \u0097 as if it were a mirror. The rhythm of the music changes. \n", "test2_true": "She jumps onto the trunk and taps. \nVIVIAN If only I could see Don Jarvis now! \nShe giggles again. \nVIVIAN I warn you, Mark - I'm hysterical... I'd rather act dying of laughter, if it's all the same to you... \nShe jumps off the trunk onto the floor. \nHe opens the trunk. she jumps into it. Her laughter echoes round the deserted studio. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. POWER HOUSE - EARLY EVENING \nThe two electricians are roaring with laughter. One of them is making tea. \n1ST ELECTRICIAN So he did it again! Now you tell one. \nCAMERA PANS to a dial on the wall... one of the needles flickers slightly. \n2ND ELECTRICIAN Half a mo... \n1ST ELECTRICIAN (O.S.) One lump or two? \n2ND ELECTRICIAN As the starlet said to the casting director... \nHe turns away from the dials, and grasps at the outstretched mug. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE SHOT of Vivian recording - her little recorder is twittering back at great speed. \nVIVIAN (to Mark, over her shoulder) What are you doing? \nShe restarts music. \nINT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING \nShe is watching Mark curiously as he arranges the lighting. \nMARK Be patient, Viv... it's going to be worth it. \nCLOSE SHOT of the studio camera. In front of it - fixed on a small hook - is a tape measure. \nMark reaches for it... then carefully measures the distance between the trunk and the camera... then he takes apiece of chalk from his pocket and makes a small cross on the floor. \nThe music continues. \nVIVIAN Oh well! I've stood alone in front of a studio camera! That's more than most have. \nMARK Ever stood... behind one? \nHe glances at a nearby dial - only a few feet away from the one which is flickering. \nVIVIAN No. \nMARK Help yourself. \nShe goes around the camera out of sight - and he is out of hers. He glances into the trunk - it is deep, and very empty. \nVIVIAN (accenting the rhythm) I can see you, Mark... perfectly! \nMARK Good... \nVIVIAN Yes, sir! I'll bet I'm the best camerawoman in the business! . . . (beating time with her feet) \nMark hurries to the side of the studio camera and picks up his cine-camera. \nVIVIAN (O.S.) I've lost you! \nMARK I'll be back. \nSuddenly Mark's face appears in the finder. \nVIVIAN Welcome, stranger! \nWe see Mark raise his cine-camera. He seems to be pointing it straight at us.  We hear a gentle purring. \nVIVIAN What are you doing? \nMARK Photographing you photographing me... \nHigh angle shot of Mark standing in front of the studio camera - photographing her photographing him. \nVIVIAN (in mock awe) Mark, you're brilliant... \nHe walks slowly towards her, holding his cine-camera to his eyes.  In the finder of Mark's cine-camera WE SEE Vivian at the studio camera. She comes closer and closer. \nVIVIAN Lost you again! \nMARK (O.S.) Never mind. \nWe see him standing almost on top of her - his cine-camera trained on her. \nMARK I'm ready now, Viv... \nShe looks up slowly - and a little hesitantly. Music, all drums. \nMARK Go and stand on that cross, will you? \nVIVIAN (solemnly) Yes, sir, Mr. Director, sir. \nHe watches her in silence as she walks to the front of the studio camera and takes up her position. while the drum- beat continues. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. COURTYARD - EARLY EVENING \nDon Jarvis is leaving the unit working on the lot. It is now bustling with activity. \nA girl comes up to him... She raises her cigarette for a light - and looks into his eyes. \nHe hands her a box of matches... and walks away.  Over his shoulder we see the other stages - apparently empty. Don Jarvis hesitates, then strides towards one. \nINT. POWER HOUSE - EARLY EVENING \nCLOSE SHOT of a dial - the needle flickering slightly. Overlaid is the voice of the 1st Electrician. \n1ST ELECTRICIAN (O.S.) ...and here's one of the wife and nipper... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.

STEPHENS We both have the key of the door... Mine needs oiling - and yours needs exercise... Off you go. \nHELEN Thank you. \nShe kisses her - and glances at the whisky glass. \nHELEN remember that you lost the toss. \nShe walks to the door. \nMRS. STEPHENS Helen... \nHELEN Yes, darling? \nMRS. STEPHENS If you're back in five minutes... I won't even finish this. \nHELEN Done! \nShe hurries out. Mrs. Stephens instantly refills her glass. CLOSE SHOT of her hand. It has begun to tremble. \nMARK'S DARK-ROOM \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark's hands, in the green light of the dark- room. He is busy unloading and winding film onto a developing rack. \nHe puts the rack of exposed film into the tank and starts the time clock. \nCLOSE SHOT of the time clock ticking. \nA knock is heard off. \nMark looks up. \nMARK Who is it? \nHELEN (O.S.) Helen... \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark.  Faintly overlaid is 'She's Got the Key of the Door'.  He looks down at the clock. \nMARK (calling) Come in, Helen! \nINT. PASSAGE - EVENING \nHelen opens the door of Mark's sitting room. We hear Mark call out from the inner room: \nMARK (O.S.) Would you... please... wait in there?...

She speaks loudly to be heard in the dark- room. \nHELEN Mother heard you come in - so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed ... \nNo reply from the inner room. \nHELEN Are you sure this is conven... \nMARK (O.S.) Won't be long! \nHelen glances at her watch... then looks curiously round the room. \nCLOSE SHOT of Vivian's recorder, placed on a chair. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen. She picks it up and looks at it, curiously, fingering the stops. \nMARK (O.S.) Hallo. \nHelen turns round. Mark is standing on the threshold of the dark-room. \nHELEN Hallo, Mark... \nHe walks towards her... he stops suddenly. He is staring at the recorder in her hand. \nHELEN I hope you don't mind - is it a tape-recorder? \nMARK Yes. \nGently he takes it from her - as if it is a cup with which she has finished - and replaces it on the shelf. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen. \nHELEN I'm sure I'm being a nuisance... but, Mark, I very much want to... \nHer voice trails away. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding out a small package. \nMARK Happy birthday. \nHELEN Mark! That's very sweet of you - but really. \nMARK It isn't much... I don't know anything about... presents for twenty-one... but I saw it this morning... so... please. \nHELEN (gently) Thank you... \nShe takes the package, and unwraps it. Inside is a slender brooch \nHELEN It's beautiful... \nMARK I like the design... More milk? \nHELEN More?... No, thank you, Mark... and I really appreciate this...

I write. \nMARK What's embar... \nHELEN I write stories for children... but so did Grimm... Hans Andersen... Lewis Carroll... \nMARK Had any published? \nHELEN Some short stories. \nMARK I'd like to read... \nHELEN I learned today... that my first book... has been accepted! ... For publication in the spring... \nMARK But that's wonderful... what's it about? \nHELEN A magic camera - and what it photographs... \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK Whatever made you... think of that? \nHELEN I'll tell you one day - I promise... \nMARK Well what does it photograph? \nHELEN I'll tell you that too - but, Mark... this is the problem... The children who read the book will want to see the pictures the camera takes - but the publishers say they're impossible to photograph, and suggest drawings... but I don't agree. \nMARK No - nothing's impossible. \nHELEN was hoping you'd say that! There must be photographs - however difficult to take - and I was wondering, Mark - if you'd... \nMARK Oh yes. \nHELEN discuss it with me. \nMARK take them. \nHELEN Mark - I can't ask you to do that... \nThey have cancelled his Oscar. \nHELEN I mean... the publisher's mightn't agree. \nMARK I'd take them... for you. \nHELEN Yes but... the money. \nMARK There are some things... which I photograph... for nothing. \nHELEN I didn't mean to offend you. \nMARK Offend? \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK Helen... if you knew what it meant... for something to happen to me... that I don't have to make happen... it's like... you've given me a twenty-first birthday... \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at him... \nMARK What does your camera photograph? \nHELEN Mark - I must go...

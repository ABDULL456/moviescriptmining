{"train": "PEEPING TOM \nScreenplay by Leo Marks \nShooting Draft, 1959 \nCopyright, 1959, Michael Powell (Theatres Ltd.) \nCopyright, 1959 1988 & 1998 Leo Marks \nThe screen remains dark for a moment. \nIn the darkness WE HEAR the film's THEME MUSIC - a gentle whirring purring noise. Nothing to be alarmed about. It might be a small contented motor. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT \nLONG SHOT of the solitary figure of a WOMAN standing professionally alone at the end of the street. \nIt is a bright, still night. We can HEAR the Woman whistling 'Stardust' merrily to herself. \nCAMERA TRACKS around her. A Man's footsteps are overlaid. \nWe HEAR the Man start to whistle 'Stardust' under his breath - haltingly at first, then in time with the Woman. \nAs we approach, she glances at us over her shoulder - then turns round for a better look. \nHer whistling stops - so, at the same moment, does the man's. \nCLOSE SHOT of DORA - a plump, attractive brunette - still young enough to need two glances at the customers. \nShe smiles at us - and is pleased with the reception. She hesitates for a long moment, weighing us up carefully... and then - half defiantly, half expecting to be laughed at. \nDORA It'll be two quid... \nEvidently we have two quid. \nShe beams with relief - throws her fur over her shoulders, jerks her head towards the right - and sets off. \nCAMERA TRACKS after her.  Overlaid is the sound of the man's footsteps. \nDora resumes her whistling. So, under his breath, does the man who is following her. \nEXT. A DESERTED STREET - NIGHT \nA wider street than the last - but just as empty. \nDora sways her way towards a small house. CAMERA FOLLOWS at a respectful distance. \nCAMERA PANS from Dora's hips to an overflowing dustbin. \nCLOSE SHOT of a man's hand throwing something into the dustbin. It is an empty packet marked Kodak Film.  CAMERA PANS to Dora's house. It stands next to a chemist shop. \nDora climbs the few steps which lead to her front door - glances round at us encouragingly - then unlocks the door. \nINT. HALLWAY OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nShe switches on a light - and hurries up a flight of stairs. \nCAMERA TRACKS after her. \nShe changes her tune to 'Goodnight Sweetheart'... and so - under his breath - does the Man who is following her. \nA woman with hair like a two-toned car comes down the stairs, winks at Dora - looks at us for a moment with great curiosity... winks... then passes out of camera. \nDora reaches the landing - we are close behind her. \nINT. LANDING OF DORA'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nDora unlocks the door of her room - and goes inside. \nINT. DORA'S ROOM - NIGHT \nShe switches on the light, throws her fur onto a chair, lights the gas fire  then turns round. \nCLOSE SHOT of Dora. She holds out her hand-smiling. \nAnd suddenly. There is a gentle whirring purring sound. \nCAMERA HOLDS ON Dora - she is staring at something with great curiosity. \nIt turns quickly to bewilderment - and the bewilderment to fear. She steps back from CAMERA - but CAMERA won't have it. \nDora is now staring at something in horror - she opens her mouth to scream - a shadow falls across her face. \nThe sound purrs on. \nFADE OUT: \nFADE IN: \nBLACK AND WHITE FILM SEQUENCE \nThe solitary figure of Dora standing professionally alone at the end of a street. WE SEE her turn towards CAMERA - and smile at us. \nWe are watching her on a 16mm screen - projected in BLACK AND WHITE. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to show the surround in natural colour. \nINT. MARK'S ROOM - NIGHT \nA darkened room in natural COLOUR. The movie screen images are in BLACK AND WHITE. \nWe can SEE the back of a Man's head as he bends intently over a projector. He is watching Dora on the screen. He is breathing quickly. \nWe see Dora's hips waggling their way home. \nThe Man raises his head, so that we cannot see the screen. \nWhen he lowers it again, we see the Woman with the two- toned hair winking at Dora... then we see Dora throwing her fur onto a chair - and turning towards us. \nWE SEE her staring at something in bewilderment... then backing away from CAMERA in fear. \nWE HEAR the Man breathing as if at the end of a very long race. \nAs Dora opens her mouth to scream, and a shadow falls across her face - the title: \nPEEPING TOM \nBlots out what is happening to her. \nOTHER CREDITS FOLLOW... behind them we can see Dora's hands pushing something away. \nBefore the DIRECTOR'S CREDIT: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. A PARK - NIGHT \nMR. PETERS Certainly, sir - anything else? \nThe Elderly Gentleman hesitates - glancing at Mark's back. Then: \nELDERLY GENTLEMAN I... er... have been told by a friend that you... er... have some views for sale? \nMR. PETERS What sort of views, sir? \nELDERLY GENTLEMAN Well, er... \nMR. PETERS This sort, sir? \nFrom under the counter he produces a thick book. Mark turns round. \nFrom his POV WE SEE the Elderly Gentleman open the book. He - er- seems - er - more than a little interested. \nELDERLY GENTLEMAN I, er... how much each? \nMR. PETERS Five shillings, sir. \nELDERLY GENTLEMAN I'll take this one... and, er... this one... and, er... how much would the lot be? \nMR. PETERS To you - five pounds, sir... \nThe Elderly Gentleman hesitates.  Mr. Peters turns over a page... and the Elderly Gentleman almost turns over with it. \nMR. PETERS Tell you what, sir. Four pounds ten - and I'll throw in The Times and Telegraph... how's that? \nELDERLY GENTLEMAN Well, er... thank you very much. \nMR. PETERS Let me wrap it for you, sir. \nHe puts it in a wrapper which says 'Educational Books'. \nMR. PETERS Shall I put you on our mailing list? \nELDERLY GENTLEMAN Oh no! But I'll look in again... \nMR. PETERS By all means, sir. \nHe holds open the door for the Elderly Gentleman, and watches him leave. \nMR. PETERS He won't be doing the crossword tonight! \nHe turns triumphantly to Mark. \nMR. PETERS (counting out money from wallet) Those pictures he chose... were all yours! (handing notes) This is yours! \nMark pockets them without counting them. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMR. PETERS (in a very different tone) And this is yours too... \nHe picks up a postcard - holds it towards Mark. \nMR. PETERS And that's what I want to talk to you about. It's a clever picture - because you're a clever lad... but, Mark... (pathetically) It's all face. \nMark looks at the postcard in silence. \nMR. PETERS I don't want to hurt your feelings, son - but if people want the Mona Lisa they go to the National Gallery. \nMARK The Louvre. \nMR. PETERS Well, wherever they go, they don't come here... so no more of this fancy stuff... \nHe pats Mark's arm. \nMR. PETERS ... now get upstairs - the girls are waiting... and so is a bonus if you give me what I want. \nMARK Thank you, sir. \nMR. PETERS (amused) What do you do with all your money? \nMARK Buy cameras. \nHe opens a door at the far end of the room. We catch a glimpse of a winding staircase. He starts to climb it. \nINT. REAR OF NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - DAY \nAt the top of the staircase is a door. Mark and his camera trudge towards it. The door opens suddenly. A vivacious young redhead - Milly - pokes her head round. She has a towel round her shoulders. \nMILLY Well look who's here! Cecil Beaton! \nFrom REVERSE ANGLE WE SEE Mark venture a shy smile at Milly. Milly opens the door impatiently. \nMILLY Come on, sonny... make us famous. \nThrough the half-open door we catch a glimpse of a second Girl (LORRAINE). She is staring out of a window, her back to camera. She is naked except for a shawl draped round her shoulders. \nMark enters the room... the door begins to close. CAMERA TRACKS towards the door. On the threshold of the room, a hood is thrown over our faces. THE SCREEN BLACKS OUT. \nIn the darkness WE HEAR Milly's voice. \nMILLY (O.S.) Did you read about that girl who was murdered last night? \nINT. STUDIO ABOVE NEWSAGENT'S - DAY \nWe are with Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera. Through the ground-glass of the camera WE SEE a SMALL INVERTED IMAGE of Milly. \nMILLY (O.S.) The same thing nearly happened to me! \nWe hear Lorraine's voice - muffled, and very far away. \nLORRAINE (O.S.) When? \nMILLY (O.S.) Last night! I went out with my boyfriend... We're getting married next month... trouble was my fiance saw us. \nThe SMALL INVERTED IMAGE of Milly peers anxiously into the camera. \nMILLY can you fix it so the bruises don't show? \nThe ground-glass camera begins travelling slowly down Milly's back. \nCLOSE SHOT of Milly. She is on a couch, lying on her stomach at a slightly oblique angle. All that WE CAN SEE are her face and naked shoulders. \nFrom Milly's POV WE SEE Mark under the hood of an antiquated camera. \nMILLY Well, can you? \nMark's voice is MUFFLED under the hood. \nMARK ...think so, Milly. \nMILLY Then be quick about it, sonny! I'm freezing. \nCLOSE SHOT of her naked toes. They start to wriggle. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark's toes - in sandals, next to the tripod of the camera. They start to wriggle. \nMARK You needn't be shy... of me... it's my first time too. \nCLOSE SHOT of Lorraine's eyes - puzzled. \nLORRAINE Yours? \nMARK In front of eyes... like... \nHe tries to go on - but words are a foreign language to him. \nMARK ...eyes... as full of... \nIn a sudden rush: \nMARK Lorraine - let my camera tell you. \nCLOSE SHOT of Lorraine standing very still \u0097 looking at him in silence. \nMilly shrugs and reaches for the coffee pot. \nOverlaid is the gentle purring of a cine-camera. \nCAMERA LINGERS on the dark liquid being poured into a cup. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nWhisky being poured into a glass. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK \nINT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING - TOWARDS SUNSET \nThe hand filling the glass is a woman's (MRS. STEPHENS). She is sitting in a high-backed chair, and we cannot see her face. Over her shoulder we watch a party in progress. A group of Young people have surrounded someone to whom they are singing: \nYOUNG PEOPLE (singing) Happy birthday to you, Happy birthday to you, \nCAMERA TRACKS towards them. \nCLOSE SHOT of TONY HUNTER, a well-built youngster in his middle twenties. \nTONY Happy birthday... dear Helen \nHe obviously means it. \nTONY happy birthday to you. \nCLOSE SHOT of 'dear HELEN'. A sensitive, intelligent, and extremely attractive girl, who \u0097 as the encircling youngsters now inform us in song - is: \nYOUNG PEOPLE Twenty-one today, She's twenty-one today, She's got the key of the door, She's never been twenty-one before. \nCLOSE SHOT of the glass by Mrs. Stephens' side. It is half empty. An elderly lady leans across to her. She is Mrs. Partridge, slightly high on a glass of sherry. \nMRS. PARTRIDGE You must be very proud of your daughter, Mrs. Stephens. \nMrs. Stephens grunts. Someone switches on a gramophone and the young couples start dancing at once. Tony hurries up to Helen. \nTONY May I? \nHelen goes towards him. A YOUNG MAN calls out sharply: \nYOUNG MAN Look! \nHe is pointing at something out of camera. All heads - except Mrs. Stephens' - follow the direction of his gaze. Mrs. Stephens continues to sit motionless in the high-backed chair. \nCAMERA PANS to the window. Mark is standing there. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at Mark. We watch him over her shoulder - Tony's arm encircling it. \nTONY (O.S.) It's that chap from upstairs. \nEXT. MARK'S HOUSE - EVENING - LOW SUN \nThe chap from upstairs presses his face to the window. From his POV WE SEE Helen's eyes looking at him - the key of the door in them - looking at him, not staring. Suddenly the rest comes into focus - Tony's arm around Helen's shoulder... the high-backed chair in the foreground with the back of that motionless head... a young couple giggling as they stare at him. Mark steps away, and the CAMERA PULLS BACK with him. \nWe catch a glimpse of the house - large, sprawling, but with a touch of quality about it, in a quiet, unpretentious street. \nMark hurries towards a side entrance. \nINT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen looking at the empty window. \nHELEN I'll ask him in... \nCLOSE SHOT of Tony - frowning. \nCAMERA PANS to Mrs. Stephens' glass... the hand which refills it has begun to tremble. \nINT. REAR OF HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe lights are on. \nWE FOLLOW Mark (and his camera) along a small passage which leads to the hall. The sound of a dance record can be heard. Mark starts to whistle it under his breath. \nINT. HALL - NIGHT \nOver his shoulder we see a staircase, and beyond it the door of Helen's sitting room. The sound of Helen's party fills the hall. \nMark reaches the staircase. There is the sound of a door opening. Helen's voice is overlaid: \nHELEN (O.S.) Excuse me! \nMark hesitates, then turns round. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen - smiling at him. \nHELEN I don't know how many times we've passed each other on the stairs? \nMark looks at her as if he does. \nHELEN ... but tonight I'm determined at least to say hello to you! So hello! \nHer directness is natural, consistent and very hard to resist. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark - smiling. \nHELEN I'm Helen Stephens. \nShe glances with unconcealed interest at the camera over his shoulder. \nHELEN I'm having a party - and the other tenants are there...  And a few friends. We'd like you to join us. \nMARK Mark... \nHELEN Pardon? \nMARK I'm Mark... \nHELEN Hallo, Mark. \nMARK All my life. \nShe looks at him in surprise. \nMARK I was born in this house Oh? \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK It's my father's. \nHELEN Do you mean I've at last found out who our landlord is? Your father? \nMARK Well - no... he's dead! \nHe hesitates. \nMARK I'm the landlord. \nShe looks at him in astonishment. \nHELEN YOU? \nMARK Yes. \nHELEN But you walk about as if you haven't paid the rent. \nMARK I haven't. \nHELEN I meant... \nMARK I know. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK It's his house - and I'll never sell it... but I can't afford the upkeep, so I let rooms. \nHe looks at her anxiously. \nMARK ... if I charge too much, tell me and I'll tell the agents. \nHELEN The rent's very reasonable, but don't say anything to the others or you'll have no peace. \nMARK Peace...? \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen. \nHELEN Mark, what do you do? \nMARK (slowly) Most of the time, I work in a film studio. \nHELEN On the photographic side, I'll bet. \nMARK I hope to be a film director... very soon. \nHELEN How exciting. \nMARK I have some spare time jobs... as well. \nHELEN To do with photography? \nMARK More milk? \nHELEN No thank you... to do with photography? \nMARK Yes... to do with photography... \nHELEN When I came in were you looking at some films? \nMARK Yes. \nHELEN Of yours? \nMARK Yes. \nHELEN I'd like to see them... \nHe looks at her in silence. \nHELEN Know I'm being rude... but I really would like to see them... (she smiles.) ...it would be a birthday present... from you to me. \nMARK Would it? \nHELEN Yes, Mark. \nMARK Oh... \nHELEN But I suppose you're too busy? \nShe puts down the glass, turns to the door. \nMARK Will you... would you... like to see them now? \nShe turns round. He is standing by the entrance to the inner room. \nHELEN Thank you... \nMARK I'll... go first. \nHe leads the way - she follows. For a moment the screen is in darkness. A dark-room darkness. \nINT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT \nWe can HEAR - faintly \u0097 the dance music from downstairs. There is a click - and the walls are suddenly bathed in diffused light, throwing the room into delicate shadow. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen looking round in amazement. \nAs certain events of possible interest are to take place in this room, here, in detail, is what amazes Helen. \nThe room is the product of three rooms which have been knocked into one. It is very large and extremely well constructed (as we are soon to learn, it was originally a laboratory). One half of the room is used for processing, and the other half for filming - and for trade shows. The two halves are lined by long shelves upon which are perched all shapes and sizes of cameras, their spectacles glinting in the light. \nIn the processing half two benches (a 'dry' bench and a 'wet' bench) face each other against opposite walls. There are three sinks above the 'wet' bench and an outburst of equipment above the 'dry'. \nThis part of the room is lit by two dark-room lamps frowning in the ceiling above the benches. \nThe other part of the room has a window at the far end of it. Heavy drapes are putted across it. \nMark's projector rests on a small table in front of the 16mm screen.  Two banks of floods and a variety of spots light this part of the room. There is a small control panel on the wall. \nSome of the equipment is ancient - but none of it is old. All of it glistens with the affection of its owner. \nThere is absolutely nothing in the room to alarm anyone except an adult... the kind who starts to wonder who paid for it all. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. He stands by the lighting panel, watching Helen. \nFrom his POV WE SEE her brushing the hair out of her eyes as she looks slowly round. He brushes the hair out of his. For a moment she turns her back to him. He presses a switch on the wall. A gentle light ripples through the back of Helen's hair. \nSHOT of Helen. She turns to him. She is very nearly at a loss for words. \nHELEN This is so... well - so many things... but above all - it's so... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HELEN'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nOver Mrs. Stephens' shoulder WE SEE the party in progress. The glass by her side is full again. Tony is dancing with an attractive blonde. \nMRS. STEPHENS Tony! \nHe turns round. \nTONY Me, Mrs. Stephens? \nThe head nods. \nTony advances reluctantly towards her. \nREVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. \nOver Tony's shoulder WE SEE a powerfully built and once lovely woman. \nShe is so perpetually drunk as almost to be sober. The few movements she makes are slow - deliberate - and give nothing away. The voice articulates so carefully that the slur scarcely shows. \nThe fact that she is blind almost helps to conceal the fact that she is drunk. Her sightless eyes stare out the camera as Tony reaches her. \nMRS. STEPHENS I want a word with you. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen's eyes. The light from the projector flickering into them. \nHELEN I hate people who chatter in films - but there's so much I want to ask. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK \nINT. THE INNER ROOM - NIGHT \nShe is leaning forward, her face cupped in her hand, watching the small screen intently. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. His face is cupped in his hand as he watches her intently. \nOver Helen's shoulder WE SEE Mark in the making. \nThe child is again asleep... this time he is being photographed from the head of the bed - the CAMERA POINTING STRAIGHT DOWN AT HIS FACE. \nA beam of light starts to shine onto his eyes, first onto the left, then onto the right. \nHELEN (in a whisper) Again? \nMark looks at her in silence. \nThe boy moves restlessly, then turns over onto his face, pulling the bedclothes round him. His right hand is limp on the pillow. The light shines for a moment on this hand, then goes out.  Helen half turns towards Mark. \nHELEN Mark, this isn't some kind of jo... \nHer attention is suddenly riveted on the screen. \nMARK (in a whisper) No, Helen. \nOver Helen's shoulder WE SEE something drop onto the child's bed... something which stays quite still for a moment, then starts crawling towards the counterpane. It is a small lizard. \nHELEN Mark, whatever is that? \nHer voice trails away. She stares - repelled and fascinated - at the screen. \nWE SEE Mark reach for his cine-camera. \nOver Helen's shoulder WE SEE the lizard reach the counterpane. It stretches itself out on the floral design - its body is pointed towards the child's hand. \nWE HEAR a click - and suddenly a spotlight falls onto Helen's face. \nOVERLAID is the GENTLE PURRING of Mark's cine-camera. She wheels towards him - blotting out the small screen. \nHELEN What are you... \nMARK wanted to photograph you... watching... \nHELEN No, Mark! \nThe camera purrs on. \nHELEN No! \nHe switches off the spot... the purring of the camera dies away. She turns towards the small screen. \nHELEN help me to understand this... this nightmare... \nThe small boy is sitting upright... screaming with terror... there is no sign of the lizard. \nA handkerchief is thrown onto the boy's bed. He continues crying - looking up into someone's face. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark watching the screen. \nWe hear a man's deep voice overlaid. \nMAN'S DEEP VOICE (O.S.) That'll do Mark... dry your eyes and stop being silly. \nSmall Mark reaches for the handkerchief and wipes his eyes... his hands are trembling. \nThe small screen trembles with them into a clumsy dissolve. \nHelen turns to Mark. \nHELEN All right... now look... Mark - what was all that about? \nHe looks at her helplessly. \nHELEN ... that was a lizard, wasn't it? Or a... \nMARK Liz... \nHELEN Well how did it get there?... How did it get there Mark?...  Was it a pet? \nMARK Not mine... \nHELEN Won't you try to explain? \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at the screen. \nMARK You'd better go! \nHELEN I like to understand what I'm shown! \nShe turns to the screen. \nHELEN What was your father trying to do?... Photographing you at nigh... \nHer voice trails away. \nMARK better go... \nHelen walks slowly towards the exit. She glances round once, over her shoulder, then goes into the other room. \nMark stares after her. \nINT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - NIGHT \nShe walks towards the door... turns round suddenly - almost in anger. \nHELEN So he was a scientist? \nHe keeps his face averted. \nHELEN What kind of scientist, Mark? \nMARK Biologist. \nHELEN What was he trying to do to you? \nHe doesn't answer. \nHELEN Mark!... \nHe turns round slowly. From his POV WE SEE the willingness to understand on her face. \nHELEN What was he trying to do to you? \nMARK Watch me... grow up... \nShe walks towards him... takes his handkerchief from his jacket pocket and wipes his forehead. \nMARK He wanted a record of a growing child... complete in every detail - if such a thing were possible - and he tried to make it possible by training a camera on me... at all times... \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK I never knew... the whole of my childhood... one moment's privacy... \nHELEN And those lights in your eyes?... and that - thing? \nMARK He was interested ... in the reactions of the nervous system... to fear...  Fear? \nHELEN Fear? \nMARK Fear. \nCLOSE SHOT of the word 'fear'. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK \nWe are looking at the spine of a book on Mark's shelf. The full title reads: The Physiology of Fear by Professor A. N. Lewis. \nMARK'S VOICE IS OVERLAID: \nMARK (O.S.) Especially fear in children - and how they react to it. \nCLOSE SHOT of the word 'fear' on the next book. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK \nThe full title reads: FEAR AND THE NERVOUS SYSTEM, PART I. PROFESSOR A. N. LEWIS.  There is a row of such books all by Professor Lewis. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK I think he learned a lot... from me... I'd wake up... screaming... sometimes... and he'd be there... taking notes... and pictures... and I'm sure good came of it... for some people... He was brilliant. \nHELEN A scientist drops a lizard onto a child's bed - and good comes of it? \nMARK I don't know... if he did... but if he did... he'll have learned something of value... \nHELEN If only about lizards!  Mark - it sounds to me as if your father was... \nMARK He founded clinics. \nHELEN He sounds completely... \nMARK He was famous! Professor A. N. Lewis... three clinics. \nHELEN Why do you still live in his house... and watch his films? \nMARK They helped make me... what I am. \nHELEN A photographer? It's no wonder, is it? But you still haven't shown me anything you've photographed! \nHe looks at her in silence. \nHELEN Will you? \nThere is a knock on the door. \nMARK One day... \nHe hurries to the door, and opens it. \nTony is standing there. \nTONY Excuse me, but... \nFrom Tony's POV WE SEE Helen looking at the door of the dark room. \nTONY Oh, there you are, Helen. \nShe turns towards him. \nTONY The party looks like breaking up, and we were wondering if... \nHELEN I'm coming. \nShe turns to Mark. \nHELEN I wish you'd join us. \nMark shakes his head. \nMARK Thanks... work. \nHELEN I hope that you... \nShe is suddenly aware of Tony watching her. She glances at the birthday cake on the table. \nHELEN ... have a sweet tooth! \nShe smiles at him. \nHELEN Thank you... for my present. \nShe goes into the passage. \nTONY Good night, old boy. \nHe puts his arm round Helen, and closes the door. \nVIVIAN I was learning my lines. \nEXTRA Didn't know you had any... \nHe glances at his watch. \nEXTRA Want a drink? Dutch? \nVIVIAN Later... perhaps. \nEXTRA Be seeing you \nHe wanders off. \nVIVIAN Mark... \nMARK Yes? \nVIVIAN (switching off music again) You didn't mind me asking? \nMARK No, more cake? \nVIVIAN No... you want to direct... more badly than anything don't you? \nMark is silent, staring at the sky. \nVIVIAN Don't you, Mark? \nMARK I want... to photograph... the impossible... \nVIVIAN What is impossible? \nMARK Something... that has never been photographed before. \nVIVIAN What? \nMARK You really want to know...? \nVIVIAN Very much, especially if there's a part for me. \nMARK I want... to photograph a murder... while it's being committed. \nVIVIAN No part for me then. \nMARK But that... isn't enough. \nVIVIAN Is this a new script? \nMARK I want... to frighten... someone... to death... and photograph... their expression of fear... \nVIVIAN Mark! What's this story called? \nMARK That is something... he never photographed... \nVIVIAN Who? \nMark is silent. \nVIVIAN Who is he, Mark? \nMARK Anyone. \nVIVIAN No one could... they'd be caught! \nMARK I wouldn't care... if I had my picture. \nVIVIAN Besides, how would you frighten anyone to death? \nMARK There's a way. \nVIVIAN Well, what? \nMARK There's a way. \nVIVIAN You'd better not tell me! I'll be scared to death tonight as it is! \nA hooter. \nVIVIAN Back on the set - shall I go first? \nMARK Please. \nShe rises to her feet. From behind the wall comes a gentle whirring purring sound. \nVIVIAN What are you doing? \nMARK Getting into practice. \nShe smiles down at him. \nVIVIAN See you tonight! \nMARK See you tonight! \nShe walks away. And the gentle purring continues. CAMERA PANS to the sun beating down on the lot. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nAn arc lamp beating down on the set. \nINT. STUDIO - DAY \nBaden bears down on the Assistant Director. \nBADEN Would you enquire if our leading lady is ready to start leading. \nA cry goes up, \nASSISTANT (O.S.) Miss Diane Ashley, please!... Miss Diane Ashley, please!... \nCLOSE SHOT of Baden turning towards the entrance. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark turning towards the entrance. \nCLOSE SHOT of entrance. \nINT. STUDIO - DAY \nMiss.  DIANE ASHLEY appears... among the many qualities she radiates is goodwill - especially towards Miss Diane Ashley. \nDIANE How are you, Sparks? Chippy? Bob? \nVOICES Hallo, Diane... \nDIANE How are you, Tom? Roger? \nVOICES Hallo, Diane... \nAnd so on, until: \nVIVIAN Now listen... they're working late on the lot. \nMARK I know. They're branched off this stage - I'm using their juice. \nHe nods, staring at her intently. \nVIVIAN We must call it off... someone's bound to see us. \nMARK They might... (rising slowly) ... but they won't interrupt us while we're filming... I've put the red light on. \nINT. ENTRANCE TO SET - EARLY EVENING \nCLOSE SHOT of the red light - burning. \nCLOSE SHOT of Vivian. \nINT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING \nVIVIAN You've what?... \nMARK Put the... \nVIVIAN Then they'll know someone's here. \nMARK They won't come in. \nVIVIAN They'll wait outside... what's the difference? \nMARK The difference is... a perfect film... \nOver his shoulder WE SEE the studio camera. \nMARK ... have waited... a long time... for this... and so have you ... no one... must interrupt it. \nShe glances round at the brazenly burning lights; shakes her head despairingly. \nVIVIAN We'll be caught. \nMARK What does that matter? \nVIVIAN Matter! \nMARK You stand to lose... a job as an extra... I stand to lose... nothing. \nShe looks at him in silence. \nMARK ...the results must be so perfect... that the risks don't count... \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK So perfect... that even he ... (he hesitates) ... even he... would say... \nVIVIAN Who Don Jarvis!? \nHe looks at her, then nods. \nVIVIAN Oh! He'd say: (imitating the great man's voice) Sign on the dotted line, kiddies! You can use my pen, but bring your own ink! (her excitement is growing) Mark... if you're sure it's worth it? \nMARK It's time to find out, Viv... \nHe walks slowly towards the studio camera. \nShe prepares for the test by switching on music and warming up with dance movements. \nVIVIAN Come on! Get hot! (she accents the rhythm) \nMark puts the cine-camera and the black cloth bag on the dolly, slowly mounts the platform, closes the blimp - and swings the camera. \nWe watch him from the top of the studio, from the door of the studio, from the Director's chair. And finally WE WATCH HIM from Vivian's POV. She stops dancing but the music continues. \nMARK You belong there... \nHe stares ahead of him, his mind far, far away... then bends and looks into the finder. \nThere is a single harsh chord of music - and the screen goes dark. It remains dark for a moment. \nSuddenly the darkness parts like curtains - and in the centre WE SEE Vivian's face in the finder of the studio camera. (Unlike the ground-glass of the newsagent's camera, we see everything the right way up and in perfect perspective.) \nMark hooks a filler-light below the camera and switches it on. He adjusts the finder until he has made of Vivian's delicate features a radiant miniature. \nThe miniature smiles shyly at him. She has stopped dancing and is looking directly at the camera. Music continues. \nVIVIAN I do feel alone in front of it... (she hesitates) I suppose stars never do? \nMARK They feel alone without it... (he looks in the eyepiece) \nThrough the film, we can see only her eyes - large and wistful. \nMARK ... and the great ones... feel alone... all the time... \nShe becomes the uninhibited Vivian again. \nVIVIAN Then I'm great, boy! What is it you want me to act? (she strikes an attitude a, la Rabbins) \nHe looks up from the camera; she smiles and starts keeping time to the rhythm again. \nVIVIAN Being frightened to death? \nMARK You remembered? \nVIVIAN Yes - and I'll have a go! \nWe hear his quick breathing. \nVIVIAN I've been wondering all the afternoon how you'd do it!  I'll bet you've thought of a wonderful twist! (she does a wonderful twist) \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. He looks down - a little sadly - and peers into the finder. (The camera dolly is on tracks - he tracks forward.) \nMusic continues - piano. \nIn the finder WE SEE a large trunk - 'at greatly reduced prices' \u0097 on the shelf behind Vivian. \nFrom Vivian's POV WE SEE Mark leave the studio camera \u0097 and hurry towards the trunks. She watches him wide-eyed. \nVIVIAN What are you doing? \nMARK Building us a set. \nHe reaches for the largest trunk. \nVIVIAN Why not pull the studio down while you're about it? They can only hang you once. \nMARK Exactly. \nHe carries the trunk towards the studio camera, and lays it carefully on the floor. \nMusic continues. \nVivian peers into the front-glass of the studio camera \u0097 as if it were a mirror. The rhythm of the music changes. \nVIVIAN Am I supposed to imagine someone is going to put me in there? \nMark is watching her over the top of the studio camera. \nMARK Yes, Viv... \nHe peers into the viewfinder. In the finder we see Vivian looking rather pathetically into camera. \nVIVIAN Mark - I hope I won't let you down... I know you're trying to create atmosphere for me - but... I just don't feel frightened! Wouldn't it be better if I just did my number? \nMARK (shaking head) Later. \nVIVIAN Oh all right! I could do anything - I feel so relaxed - and that's due to you... You're so at home with that camera you make me feel at home too... you have it in you, boy! \nFrom her POV WE SEE see him raise his head slightly. \nMARK Ready, Viv? \nMARK VIVIAN (great effort) Well-I'll try - \nIn the finder we see her wrinkling her brow. \nMARK VIVIAN But what... would... frighten me to death? (looking appealingly into camera) Set the mood for me, Mark... \nMARK Well... \nHe goes and switches off the recorder. The sudden silence is startling. \nMARK Imagine someone... coming towards you... who's going to kill you - regardless of consequences... \nVIVIAN A madman? \nMARK Yes - but he knows it... and you don't... and just to kill you... isn't enough for him. \nVIVIAN But how would he frighten me to? \nShe stares into focusing screen - intrigued, but not frightened, not even by the silence and shadowy vastness around her. \nMARK Stay there, Viv... you're... just right. \nShe stands motionless - staring into camera. \nINT. CORRIDOR IN STUDIO - EARLY EVENING \nCLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis. He is standing motionless, staring down a corridor. \nWhat he is staring at is out of camera - and it is puzzling the great man. \nHe walks quietly along the corridor. \nCLOSE SHOT of Vivian. \nVIVIAN I can't imagine what you've thought of! \nINT. STUDIO - EARLY EVENING \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. He raises his head slowly - and locks the studio camera off. Then he walks slowly towards her. \nHIGH ANGLE SHOT of Mark walking towards Vivian. \nCAMERA ZOOMS DOWN to the trunk behind her. Mark's voice is overlaid: \nMARK (O.S.) Suppose this... were one of his weapons... \nCLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis. \nINT. CORRIDOR - EARLY EVENING \nThe great man is poised for the kill. He is moving forward stealthily... and suddenly breaks into a run. \nCAMERA PANS - and WE SEE the object of his attentions. A wisp of smoke is coming from behind an alcove. \nCLOSE SHOT of a Fireman - smoking a cigarette. \nCLOSE SHOT of Don Jarvis - smoking! \nCLOSE SHOT of the Fireman's terror as he sees Don Jarvis. \nJARVIS Smoking on duty! \nThe Fireman opens his mouth to explain \u0097 and smoke exudes. \nJARVIS Come with me! \nThe Fireman follows him meekly. \nCAMERA PANS. \nSo near - yet a lifetime away - a red light is burning above a closed door. \nCLOSE SHOT of Vivian - puzzled. \nVIVIAN That..? \nINT. STUDIO E. - EARLY EVENING \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nHe is holding his cine-camera; fixed to it is a collapsible tripod. \nSuddenly he pulls one leg of the tripod out. WE SEE that a very sharp spike protrudes from the end of it. \nFrom Mark's POV WE SEE Vivian looking at the spike. \nHe raises it towards her - until the spike is only inches from her throat. \nVIVIAN Yes... that would be frightening! \nMARK But... there's something else... \nWe can hear his heart pounding as if it will burst - and gradually Vivian, too, becomes aware of it. \nVIVIAN Well? What is it? \nJust for a moment Mark's arm moves. His back hides what he is doing. Suddenly WE SEE Vivian turn her head sharply - she is looking at something out of camera. \nVIVIAN (in a whisper) That...? \nThe spike is very close to her throat - but Vivian ignores it, staring out of camera. \nOver Mark's shoulder we concentrate on Vivian's face. \nVIVIAN (in a whisper) Mark... take it... \nThe fear on her face is rapidly growing... \nVIVIAN ... away! \nShe tries to move back - but the trunk prevents her. \nMRS. STEPHENS We both have the key of the door... Mine needs oiling - and yours needs exercise... Off you go. \nHELEN Thank you. \nShe kisses her - and glances at the whisky glass. \nHELEN remember that you lost the toss. \nShe walks to the door. \nMRS. STEPHENS Helen... \nHELEN Yes, darling? \nMRS. STEPHENS If you're back in five minutes... I won't even finish this. \nHELEN Done! \nShe hurries out. Mrs. Stephens instantly refills her glass. CLOSE SHOT of her hand. It has begun to tremble. \nMARK'S DARK-ROOM \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark's hands, in the green light of the dark- room. He is busy unloading and winding film onto a developing rack. \nHe puts the rack of exposed film into the tank and starts the time clock. \nCLOSE SHOT of the time clock ticking. \nA knock is heard off. \nMark looks up. \nMARK Who is it? \nHELEN (O.S.) Helen... \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark.  Faintly overlaid is 'She's Got the Key of the Door'.  He looks down at the clock. \nMARK (calling) Come in, Helen! \nINT. PASSAGE - EVENING \nHelen opens the door of Mark's sitting room. We hear Mark call out from the inner room: \nMARK (O.S.) Would you... please... wait in there?... Developing. \nHelen goes in, closing the door behind her. \nINT. MARK'S SITTING ROOM - EVENING \nHelen enters. She speaks loudly to be heard in the dark- room. \nHELEN Mother heard you come in - so I guessed you wouldn't be in bed ... \nNo reply from the inner room. \nHELEN Are you sure this is conven... \nMARK (O.S.) Won't be long! \nHelen glances at her watch... then looks curiously round the room. \nCLOSE SHOT of Vivian's recorder, placed on a chair. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen. She picks it up and looks at it, curiously, fingering the stops. \nMARK (O.S.) Hallo. \nHelen turns round. Mark is standing on the threshold of the dark-room. \nHELEN Hallo, Mark... \nHe walks towards her... he stops suddenly. He is staring at the recorder in her hand. \nHELEN I hope you don't mind - is it a tape-recorder? \nMARK Yes. \nGently he takes it from her - as if it is a cup with which she has finished - and replaces it on the shelf. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen. \nHELEN I'm sure I'm being a nuisance... but, Mark, I very much want to... \nHer voice trails away. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. He is holding out a small package. \nMARK Happy birthday. \nHELEN Mark! That's very sweet of you - but really. \nMARK It isn't much... I don't know anything about... presents for twenty-one... but I saw it this morning... so... please. \nHELEN (gently) Thank you... \nShe takes the package, and unwraps it. Inside is a slender brooch \nHELEN It's beautiful... \nMARK I like the design... More milk? \nHELEN More?... No, thank you, Mark... and I really appreciate this... I'm going to put it on now. \nHe watches her hold it against her dress. \nHELEN There?... Or there?... \nMARK The first place... \nHELEN I think so too!... \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen pinning it on. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark touching his lapel. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen glancing at her watch. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark glancing at his. He thinks of the ticking clock in the dark-room. \nHelen looks up, and sees him. \nHELEN I am keeping you. \nMARK No... I promise. \nHELEN Mark, I'm here for some advice. \nMARK From me?  Please... \nMark lifts the rack of glistening film out of the fixing bath and scans the image. \nCLOSE SHOT - Mark's face and the tell-tale black and white images. \nCLOSE SHOT - the film. A pile of trunks. \nIn the darkness we hear a man enquire softly: \nMAN'S VOICE Looking for a trunk? \nCLOSE SHOT of a Tall Man with a severe face. He is standing in front of a familiar pile of trunks marked at 'Specially Reduced Prices'. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK SLOWLY - and WE SEE whom he is addressing. It is Diane. \nCAMERA PULLS FURTHER BACK and WE SEE that we are in a small theatre watching rushes... \nINT. THEATRE IN STUDIO - DAY \nCAMERA PANS across Baden's disgruntled face... the Chief Cameraman's bored face... the Script Girl's puzzled face... to Diane's expression of rapture as she watches herself on the screen. \nDIANE (O.S.) I'd like to see that one. \nFrom Diane's POV WE WATCH the screen. We see the Tall Man (SHOP ASSISTANT) reaching for a trunk and laying it on the counter. He opens it with a flourish. Vivian passes across the screen - glances casually at the trunk - and wanders off. \nBADEN No - no - no - we must get some comedy into this...! \nThe Assistant Director nods. \nBADEN We'll retake it this morning... \nCAMERA LINGERS for a moment on the screen as Diane (on- screen) smiles at the Assistant. \nDIANE (she pockets a small item) I'll take it. \nThe Assistant bows and closes the trunk. We dissolve to the set itself - \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. STUDIO - DAY \nThe Assistant is leaning over the counter, listening intently. Diane stands in front of the counter, receiving the attentions of the Make-up Man. \nBaden's voice is overlaid: \nBADEN I want some comedy in this scene... \nCAMERA PULLS BACK \nThe unit is busy preparing for a retake. The studio camera (and its crew) are off camera, and we concentrate on Baden briefing his artistes. \nHe is clutching a script as if afraid that opening it might be indecent exposure. \nBADEN Instead of taking the first trunk you see, I want you, darling... to ask for a blue trunk - and when he brings it to you, to ask for a red one - and when he brings that, to ask for a white one... (turns to the Assistant) And you, Michael... get the trunks one by one - growing more and more fed up - and we'll end on a gag which I'll think of in a minute - all right? \nDIANE I don't feel it! \nBADEN Don't feel it! Do it! \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR (hastily) Positions, everyone! \nOver Mark's shoulder - behind the camera - WE WATCH the Unit taking up positions. \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR Anyone seen Vivian? \nBADEN Who? \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR The red-headed bystander - Viv. \nBADEN (impatiently) Never mind - I'm cutting her out of this scene... Let's run it. \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR (shouting) Quiet, everyone! \nFrom Mark's POV WE WATCH the scene being rehearsed. Diane approaches the trunk counter and the Assistant smiles at her. \nASSISTANT Can I interest you in a trunk? \nDIANE Thank you... (pointing) I'd like to see that one... \nASSISTANT Certainly, madam... \nHe turns away. She pockets a small item from the counter. He heaves a trunk forward. \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR It's beautifully fitted - (he opens it) \nShe takes a perfunctory glance - \nDIANE I'd like to see one in red. \nASSISTANT Certainly, madam. \nShe pockets another item.  He turns and wrestles with another trunk... brings it forward and opens it \nDIANE ... do you have one in white? \nASSISTANT Certainly, madam. \nMark walks away quietly from the back of the Camera Crew. He hurries to the shelf where he keeps his cine-camera and a lunch basket. He reaches for his camera. \nDiane's voice is overlaid. \nDIANE (O.S.) Do you have one in blue? \nASSISTANT (O.S.) Certainly, madam... \nMark turns towards the rehearsal and raises his cine-camera. WE SEE the Assistant try to lift a blue trunk - and half collapse with the weight of it. \nCLOSE SHOT of Baden - beaming. \nThe Assistant manages to drag the trunk forward. He leans over it - exhausted - then starts to open it. \nMark moves round until Diane's face is in the finder. \nAs the lid of the trunk is opened we can see only her eyes above the rim of the lid... WE HEAR her scream. \nCLOSE SHOT of Baden - freezing. \nThere is the sound of a body falling to the ground. \nBADEN The silly bitch! She's fainted in the wrong scene... \nFADE OUT: \nIn the darkness WE HEAR a telephone ringing... and then another... and then another... then they all merge into one big blast. \nFADE IN: \nCAMERA TRACKS quickly towards a door marked PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT. \nINT. PUBLICITY DEPARTMENT - DAY \nSERGEANT MILLER Well now... let's get ourselves organized... (taking a piece of paper from his pocket) We don't want to keep you cooped up in here, so we've worked out a timetable... We'll talk to the artists first, then the technicians in this order... \nMark reaches for his cine-camera... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nA SERIES OF BRIEF SHOTS of the unit being interviewed by the police. \nEXT. STUDIO GROUNDS - DAY \nThe Young Extra who spoke to Vivian in the exterior set points excitedly to the wall where Vivian and Mark lay. \nThe Inspector and Sergeant carefully examine both sides of the wall. The Inspector stoops, picks up something with a pair of tweezers and puts it in an envelope. \nCAMERA PANS. \nA few passers-by look on from a distance. One of them is watching through his cine-camera. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY \nThe Young Extra who shared Vivian's dressing room is talking to the Chief Inspector and Sergeant. \nEXTRA ...she said she didn't want a lift - because she had a call to make locally. \nCHIEF INSPECTOR Did she say where? \nEXTRA No, sir... and when I left, she was still in the dressing room. \nCHIEF INSPECTOR I see... let's have a look at this dressing room, shall we? \nEXTRA Yes, sir ... \nINT. PASSAGE IN STUDIO - DAY \nThe Policemen and the Extra are walking away from camera down a passage. A few members of other units pass them by without a glance. One of these (A GIRL) smiles into camera. \nGIRL Hallo, Mark... \nMARK (O.S.) Hallo. \nThe girl walks out of picture. THE CAMERA (and Mark) TRACK after the Policemen. \nINT. ENTRANCE TO DRESSING ROOM - DAY \nAs the Inspector opens the door of the dressing room, Mark hurries past. He raises his cine-camera and photographs the Sergeant. The Sergeant turns to close the door. He sees Mark. straightens his tie and looks as severe as he can. \nSERGEANT Hey, I don't think you ought to do that! \nMARK Sorry, sir. \nHe hurries down the passage. \nINSPECTOR (turning round) Do what? \nSERGEANT Make me famous. Some chap was giving me a screen test \nThe Extra's voice is overlaid - a hint of hysteria in it. \nEXTRA (O.S.) That's where she sat.  Inspector. \nThe Inspector turns away, and the Sergeant closes the door. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SMALL OFFICE - DAY \nThe door of the small office opens - and the Chief Cameraman comes out. \nCAMERA PANS - \nOn a bench at the end of the passage Mark, the Clapper Boy, and a member of the camera-crew are waiting. \nVOICE And whoever did it must be... \nCHIEF CAMERAMAN You're next. \nThe Crew-member hurries into the office, and closes the door. The Chief Cameraman wanders off thoughtfully. \nMark and the Clapper Boy are left sitting side by side. \nCLAPPER BOY I've been watching you... \nMARK Oh? \nCLAPPER BOY Have you been filming those policemen? \nMARK Yes, I've a few quite interesting shots of them - it's a chance I never expected! \nCLAPPER BOY A chance for what? \nMARK To photograph... an investigation... or as much of it as I can. \nCLAPPER BOY What on earth for? \nMARK It will complete a documentary I'm making. \nCLAPPER BOY documentary? \nMark nods. \nCLAPPER BOY What's it about? \nMARK I'd rather not tell you till it's finished. And it soon will be ... \nCLAPPER BOY But suppose they catch you? \nMARK Oh they will - they look very efficient. \nCLAPPER BOY Don't you mind? \nMARK No. \nCLAPPER BOY But they might confiscate your camera. \nMARK I'm afraid they will! But by then... I'll have finished with it. \nCLAPPER BOY I don't... \nThe door of the small room opens, and the Crew-member comes out. \nCREW-MEMBER You, Mark? \nMARK Thanks... \nHe rises slowly... the cine-camera is over his shoulder. \nCLAPPER BOY Mark, hadn't you better leave that with me? \nINSPECTOR Thanks. (he glances at the Sergeant) Carry on with the interviews, Sergeant. \nSERGEANT Yes, sir. \nFrom the Sergeant's POV WE SEE Mark turn to go into the passage. \nThe Sergeant stares at the camera on his shoulder... then the door closes. \nThe Sergeant makes a note on a piece of paper. \nINT. PASSAGE - DAY \nThe Inspector and Mark walk side by side along the passage. The Clapper Boy comes into view - still reading Sight and Sound. \nThe Clapper Boy glances up - just in time to see the Inspector and Mark walk side by side to the end of the corridor. \nCLAPPER BOY (staring after them) I warned him to be careful! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. ENTRANCE TO SET - DAY \nA Constable is standing outside the entrance to the set. From his POV WE SEE the Inspector and Mark approach.  The Constable stiffens...  From Mark's POV WE SEE the Constable barring the entrance. \nINSPECTOR I think I can find my way now... \nMark smiles. \nINSPECTOR ...thanks for the escort \nThe Inspector hurries towards the door of the set. \nThe Constable opens it - and the Inspector goes inside. \nThe Constable closes the door - and stands in front of it. \nMark turns away quickly. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. COURTYARD - DAY \nThe carpark is jammed with cars - but there is hardly anyone in sight. Mark hurries towards the large sliding doors of Stage E - they are a few feet apart. He looks round carefully, then slips inside. \nINT. STAGE E. - DAY \nFacing Mark is the darkened set of an hotel bedroom. Beyond this is another set - also in darkness - and beyond this yet another. Only in the far comer of the studio - in the furthermost set - is there a light burning. Voices can faintly be heard coming from this set. \nMark walks quietly towards a long ladder which leads up to the gantry. Carefully - rung by rung - he starts to climb the ladder. At the top of the ladder is a gallery. Mark moves along the maze of bridges until he is nearly above the Policemen. \nMark raises his head cautiously - and looks down. \nFar below WE CAN SEE the Inspector standing next to the Doctor - a tall, silver haired man - who is peering into an open trunk. Detectives are photographing the set. Mark raises his cine-camera... its gentle purring seems to echo round the studio. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark's jacket pocket. A row of pencils is sticking out. As he leans forward the pencils tilt. \nThrough the finder-matte of Mark's camera WE SEE the Inspector - very far away - peering into the trunk and nodding. \nA faint echo of conversation is overlaid. \nDOCTOR (O.S.) No doubt at all... wounds were caused by the same instrument... \nMark changes lens (and alters the finder to a 75mm lens). The Doctor's face - thin and impersonal - appears in the finder over the lid of the trunk. \nDOCTOR (O.S.) ... both women... subjected to the most violent shock... \nINSPECTOR (O.S.) What sort of shock? \nDOCTOR ...still cannot determine - but look! \nHe points to something in the trunk - out of the camera's eye-line. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nHe balances carefully - then raises the camera above his head. As he leans forward, the pencils fall. WE SEE them shooting like small torpedoes into the darkness below. They make three separate landings. \nCLOSE SHOT of the Inspector. Looking up. \nFrom his POV WE SEE tiers of scaffolding deep in shadow... \nINSPECTOR Quiet, everyone.  Please... \nThe Detectives make as much noise to become quiet as the normal occupants of the studio - and then there is complete silence. \nComplete, except for the Doctor's asthmatic breathing... And then - so gently that it might almost be in our own minds - WE HEAR a purring sound from the shadows above. The Inspector listens intently. \nDETECTIVE I thought I heard a putty cat! \nThere is a burst of laughter - the Inspector frowns. \nINSPECTOR I don't want to spoil anyone's fun, but we do have a maniac on our hands, and if we don't get him quickly there'll be a third unsolved murder to report to the Commissioner. So let's hurry things up, shall we? \nDETECTIVE Sorry, Chief! \nThe 'putty cat' Detective raises his flashlamp towards the trunk counter. In the brilliant flash of light that ensues, we glimpse a shadowy figure moving towards a ladder high in the scaffolding... But then we are looking for it - no one else is. The flashlight dies away. \nThe scene fades with it. \nCLOSE SHOT of a knitting-needle held upwards. \nAnother knitting-needle scales down it like a fireman descending a ladder. \nCAMERA PULLS BACK \nINT. HELEN S SITTING ROOM - DAY \nMrs. Stephens is doing her knitting. The inevitable glass stands on the table beside her. Helen is seated opposite, reading from a newspaper. \nHELEN she was appearing in Arthur Baden's new film The Walls Are Closing In, starring Diane Ashley. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens listening intently. \nHELEN a spokesman at the studio said that her performance in the film showed such promise, that her role was to have been built up... All work at the studio ceased today as a tribute to her memory! \nMrs. Stephens sips from her glass.  The Prime Minister to visit Athens. \nMRS. STEPHENS Mark is in films, isn't he? \nHELEN Yes, darling... It is reliably... \nMRS. STEPHENS I wonder if he knew her? \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen looking up. \nHELEN I'll ask him tonight... \nMRS. STEPHENS Is he taking you out? \nHELEN If he's free. \nHELEN Darling, we forgot to toss. \nMrs. Stephens grunts. \nHELEN Supper's laid out in the kitchen. \nMRS. STEPHENS If you're not back early, you'll find me laid out with it! \nHELEN We'll be early! Good night, darling. \nMRS. STEPHENS Good night... \nMark holds the door open for Helen and she goes into the passage. Mark turns and takes a long look at Mrs. Stephens. She is in the middle of raising her glass. She stops suddenly, the glass poised mid-air. He goes out - closing the door. She finishes her drink as if it is her last. \nINT. PASSAGE - DAY \nHelen is waiting by the door. \nFrom her POV WE SEE Mark coming eagerly towards her, his camera over his shoulder. \nHELEN Mark... \nMARK Yes, Helen? \nHELEN I want to ask you something rather personal... \nHe looks at her anxiously. \nHELEN How long is it since you've gone out without that? \nMARK Without what? \nHELEN Your camera... \nMARK Oh... \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK I... don't think I know? \nHELEN Exactly. I've never seen you without it... but are you going to need it tonight? \nHe looks at her in silence. \nHELEN Well are you? And if so... shall I bring some work with me too? \nMARK I'm not going to need it tonight! \nHELEN Good - then give it to me! \nShe holds out her hand. He looks at her, appalled. \nHELEN ...It'll be quite safe - I'll put it away for you. \nMARK (in a whisper) No! \nHELEN Then take it upstairs - if you can't trust me with it... \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK I trust you. \nHELEN Then look... \nShe opens the door of her bedroom - and turns on the light. \nHELEN ...let's put it in here. \nINT. HELEN'S BEDROOM \nShe crosses to a cupboard and unlocks it, then turns round. He is standing hesitantly on the threshold. \nHELEN Come in - and see for yourself. \nHe looks slowly round the room, stares for a moment at the bed in the comer, but he won't cross the threshold. He stays outside. \nHELEN We'll put it in here - and lock it. \nMARK This... was my mother's room. \nHELEN Was it, Mark?... \nAgain he stares at the bed. \nHELEN I am being tactless, aren't I? ... It's just that... I thought it was growing into an extra limb, and - but you bring it with you if you want to. \nHe takes off his camera - and holds it out to her. \nHELEN Thank you... \nShe takes it from him, puts it into the cupboard, and locks it. Then offers him the key. \nMARK You... \nHELEN Thank you. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nMARK I feel... \nHELEN Yes? \nMARK Can't describe it! Could only photograph it - \nShe laughs. \nHELEN Shall I tell you what I feel? \nMARK Yes. \nHELEN Famished! \nMARK Good! \nThey hurry towards the door. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MARK'S HOUSE - DAY \nThey walk down the steps of the house. \nMARK There's a small place round the corner... It's awfully good on Christmas Day. \nHELEN Is it? \nMARK Yes... there aren't too many open then. \nHELEN No - it sounds fun. \nHELEN Yes, Mark... in case, one day, a child comes in and asks for it! \nMARK I'll come in. \nHELEN I'm not popular with my customers! They ask me for horror comics - and I take their sticky hands and drag them to where there are books! \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen. \nHELEN ... and do you know, Mark, waiting for them to come in next time and ask for books... is as exciting... as a horror comic... \nMARK What does your magic camera photograph? \nHELEN People... \nMARK Yes?... \nHELEN It's owned by a little boy who is terrified of grown-ups... but when he looks in his magic camera he sees grown-ups as they were when they were children... and he isn't frightened any longer. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark listening, engrossed. \nHELEN ... and one day he gives his camera away to a little boy who is even more frightened of grown-ups than he was - and do you know what he finds? \nThe little boy opposite her shakes his head. \nHELEN ... that when he looks at grown- ups without his camera he can still see them as they were when they were children!  And that means that he's grown up himself... \nA moment's pause. She drinks her wine - shy, awaiting his reaction. \nMARK What made you think of this story? \nHELEN You did! \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark. \nHELEN ... I looked out of my window - and saw you going off to work carrying that camera like a little boy with a satchel... and an idea came... so thank you... \nMARK I'd like to think... I was responsible... in some way... \nHELEN Now what do I do about the photographs? \nMARK Take 'em! \nHe slams the table so violently that a lady nearby looks around... then reaches for his camera. \nMARK Oh! \nHelen smiles. \nMARK There isn't a single face that doesn't look like a child's - not a single one - if you catch it at the right moment. \nHe turns around excitedly and sees her watching him. \nMARK It would be a challenge!... Unlike anything I've photographed! \nHELEN What have you photographed, Mark? \nMARK Everything. But nothing I'd want children to see. \nShe looks at him curiously. \nMARK But this would belong to them - and they'd know if it wasn't right... Oh, Helen... I would like to find those faces for you... with you... \nHELEN Very well! Let's try! \nHe laughs excitedly... She looks regretfully at her watch. At once he looks at his. \nMARK You made a promise to your mother - \nHELEN (gently) Yes, Mark... \nMARK You'd better keep it. \nHELEN Thank you... \nHe signals to the head waiter... and pays his first bill for two. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.STREET - NIGHT \nThey walk along the street very close together, but not quite touching. Above them a light is shining on a blind revealing a shadow of a woman undressing. \nMark glances at the blind - then looks away quickly. \nHe stares ahead of him... and continues to stare ahead of him. \nSuddenly Helen tucks her arm through his, and smiles up at him... they walk on in silence. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HALL OF MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nHelen and Mark come in quietly, and close the door. \nShe glances round the dimly lit hall. There is no light under any of the doors, except one at the end of the passage. \nHELEN Mother must have gone to bed. (she turns to find him looking at her) Mark, it was a wonderful evening... \nMARK That's what I was going to say... a wonderful evening... \nHELEN (gently) And you made it wonderful... without your camera. \nA shadow passes over his face. \nHELEN (gently) I'll get it for you. \nHe stands motionless as she goes into her room... \nFrom his POV WE SEE the half-opened door - and the bed in the comer. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark forcing himself to look away. \nHelen reappears on the threshold - the camera in her hand. He looks down at it - then slowly stretches out his hand. \nHELEN wonder how this sees grown-ups? (she turns the camera round) ...me, for instance... now that I am one. (she looks at herself in the lens) \nMARK Not you! (he takes the camera from her) \nHELEN Mark. \nMARK It never will... see you! \nHELEN Why not? \nHe hesitates. \nMARK Whatever I photograph - \nHELEN Yes? \nMARK (O.S.) Like a chair? \nMRS. STEPHENS (O.S.) What is the film you're showing now? \nVery faintly we hear Tony singing in his bath. \nFADE IN: \nThe singing dies away, and the sound returns to normal. \nOver Mark's shoulder WE SEE Mrs. Stephens holding her stick in front of her. \nMRS. STEPHENS Why don't you lie to me? I'd never know... \nMARK You'd know at once - \nMrs. Stephens smiles - then turns her head towards the 16mm screen. \nMRS. STEPHENS Take me to your cinema. \nMARK Yes. \nHe takes her arm gently and guides her towards us. \nBoth of them stare at the 16mm screen... She leans forward - her face only inches from the screen - the light from the projector flickering on to her. \nREVERSE ANGLE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens. Slowly she stretches out her hands and touches the screen. \nMRS. STEPHENS What am I seeing, Mark? \nHer head and shoulders blot out most of the screen - but between her outspread fingers WE CATCH A GLIMPSE of a girl's terrified eyes. \nMRS. STEPHENS Why don't you answer? \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark and Mrs. Stephens. \nMARK (staring at the screen) It's no good - I was afraid it wouldn't be. \nMRS. STEPHENS What? \nMARK The lights failed too soon. \nMRS. STEPHENS (pause) They always do. \nMARK I'll have to try again. \nHe hurries to his cine-camera. \nMRS. STEPHENS I've yet to meet an artist who could judge his own work... \nMark slips a new spool of film into his cine-camera. \nMRS. STEPHENS What do you think you've spoiled? \nMARK An opportunity... now I must find another. \nHe looks at her thoughtfully, then presses a light switch. A spotlight falls blindingly on to her eyes. He presses another switch, and then another, until the whole of her face is shining with light. \nMRS. STEPHENS Why are you putting those lights on my face? \nHe walks towards her. She starts to back away. \nThe shadow of Mark's head appears on the 16mm screen. WE SEE him raise his camera - then pull down the tripod. \nBlack out into the grey darkness of Mrs. Stephens' world. \nWE HEAR the purring of Mark's camera - more clearly than we have yet heard it. (There is the faint rasp of a cog which needs oiling.) The sound of footsteps approaching... the purring changes direction. \nMRS. STEPHENS (O.S.) Mark... \nMARK (O.S.) It's almost over... \nThe purring is on top of her. There is a sudden thud. \nFADE IN: \nMrs. Stephens is leaning against the wall... she has dropped her heavy stick. It lies on the floor a few feet away from her. Mark is kneeling in front of her - the tripod firmly on the floor. The cine-camera is pointing upwards into her face. He peers excitedly into the viewfinder. \nMARK Please let me finish! It's for Helen! \nShe edges towards her stick. He hurries forward and picks it up. He looks at the spike on the end of it - then carefully gives it to her by the handle. She grasps it tightly. \nMRS. STEPHENS What do you mean? It's for Helen? \nMARK She wants to see something I've photographed! \nHe returns excitedly to his camera. \nMRS. STEPHENS My daughter sees enough of my face without photographs... \nOn Mark's focusing screen WE SEE the fear on her face. Her hand trembles as she wipes away the perspiration. \nMARK (O.S.) Please... don't be frightened. \nMRS. STEPHENS Not frightened! Hot! \nBut it is fear that we are looking at. \nMRS. STEPHENS So put that camera away... \nOn the focusing screen we see her moisten her lips nervously. \nMARK Yes! \nHe switches off the camera abruptly, and folds up the tripod. He turns away without looking at her - and hurries to the door. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mrs. Stephens listening to his movements - puzzled. \nMRS. STEPHENS In rather a hurry, aren't you? \nHe glances towards her. \nFrom his POV WE SEE the fear in her eyes. He looks away at once, staring into the darkened room. \nMARK It's late. \nFrom her POV (shooting over her shoulder with a large CLOSE SHOT of her ear in the foreground) WE SEE Mark standing in the doorway - and hear, very clearly, his quick, uneasy breathing. \nMARK You must be tired... \nMRS. STEPHENS You're anxious to get rid of me all of a sudden. \nWe hear his quick intake of breath. \nMRS. STEPHENS I won't be selfish... You can take some more pictures - if you want to... \nMARK No... thank you. \nMRS. STEPHENS (quietly) Why not, Mark? \nDOCTOR ROSEN He asked if I knew his father... which I did... a brilliant man! \nEXT. GROUNDS OF STUDIO - DAY \nThe Inspector and Doctor are standing by the bushes where Mark and Vivian met. \nINSPECTOR Is that all he wanted? \nDOCTOR think so... we had a little chat about scoptophilia - and he's going to show me... \nINSPECTOR About what? \nDOCTOR Voyeurism. \nINSPECTOR Eh? \nDOCTOR What makes people into Peeping Toms, one of his father's subjects, apparently. \nINSPECTOR (slowly) Peeping Toms... \nDOCTOR An interesting boy... he has his father's eyes... you don't suspect him, do you? \nINSPECTOR I suspect 'em all - what about you? \nDOCTOR I'm interested in that chap with the bald head and hatchet face... there's something on his mind! \nINSPECTOR No wonder... he's the director! \nHe turns away thoughtfully. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark glancing impatiently at his watch. \nINT. STUDIO - DAY \nCLOSE SHOT of Baden glancing at his watch... He whispers to the Assistant Director. \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR All right, everyone. This is the last shot... Make it a good one! \nCAMERA PANS to a comer of the studio.  The Inspector and Sergeant stand in the shadows. \nINSPECTOR (quietly) Got your list, Sergeant? \nSERGEANT (he produces if) YES, SIR. \nINSPECTOR I want to see how some of them spend their spare time... \nSERGEANT Which ones, sir? \nINSPECTOR Exactly, Sergeant...

LIBRARY \nMark slowly turns his back and walks away, gradually gathering speed. The man in the raincoat follows him. \nEXT. NEWSAGENT'S SHOP. LATE AFTERNOON \nMark hurries towards the shop... ahead of him a street clock stands at just on six. Mark unslings his cine-camera and photographs this clock... then he hurries into the shop. \nThe man in the raincoat walks into camera. He looks at the clock, puzzled, then glances at the newsagent's window. He gazes with interest at Mark's photograph of Milly, then walks thoughtfully down the street. \nAll the clocks in the kingdom chime the hour of six. \nINT. NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON \nMr. Peters is behind the counter. \nMR. PETERS Don't make a habit of this! \nMARK I won't, sir. \nMR.

(he holds out a key) \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark staring at the key. \nMR. PETERS What's the matter? Haven't you ever seen a key before? \nMark takes the key. He starts to smile. \nMR. PETERS The till will be empty - if that's what you're smiling about. \nMark turns to the door. \nMR. PETERS You know what I want now! No fancy stuff... \nMark goes into the inner room; he is still smiling. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. NEWSAGENT'S SHOP - LATE AFTERNOON \nFrom the opposite side of the street, we see Mr. Peters locking the door of the shop, and hurrying down the road.

Who wants a lift to town? \n1ST GIRL In what? \nEXTRA colleague's car... there's room for two on my lap - three at a pinch. \n1ST GIRL Which is what we'd get. \n2ND GIRL You, Viv? \nVIVIAN No, thanks...

She turns to leave - then looks curiously at the projector. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen - hesitating. Like a small girl in front of her mother's make-up box, she touches the projector tentatively, hesitates again, then presses a switch. A beam of light shoots out. We watch Helen's face as she looks at the screen. Nothing seems wrong for a few seconds - then something starts to happen to the comers of her mouth... and then her eyes become locked... and cannot stop watching. Some kind of sound comes from the back of her throat. Her hands dig into the table and she tries to stand up. She cannot manage it the first time - and keeps on watching, then, like a child waking from a nightmare, she jerks herself away from the table, and stumbles towards the door. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark standing there - watching her. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen staring at him... again we hear that sound from the back of her throat.

Helen wheels round. The screaming seems to be coming from the walls. Mark's hand is on a switch - one of a number on a panel. \nMARK ... aged five... \nHe presses another switch. There is a click, and the screaming stops, to be replaced by a low sobbing. \nMARK ... aged seven... \nHe presses another switch. There is a moment's silence. \nMARK All the rooms were wired for sound... and... still are. \nWE SUDDENLY HEAR the ticking of a clock. \nMARK Your room. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen - listening. \nMARK Your mother's . \nThe click of a switch - and we hear a loud snoring. \nMARK Tony's. \nThe click of a switch - and we hear Tony's voice. \nTONY (O.S.) No one will come in... honestly, darling... \nGIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) I don't care! \nTONY But darling... \nGIRL'S VOICE (O.S.) Stop it, Tony! \nMark listens with interest. \nHELEN (quietly) Turn it off! \nHe does so - at once. She walks towards him. He turns away from her. \nHELEN Look at me, Mark! \nMARK Not if you're frightened... \nHELEN Look at me! \nSlowly he faces her. \n", "test3_true": "MARK No. \nHELEN What did you do, Mark...? \nHe tries to turn away - but she follows him. \nHELEN If you want to torment me... for the rest of my life... then make me imagine! \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark - his eyes closed. \nHELEN What did you do ... to those girls? \nMARK Can't... \nHELEN Show me, Mark... \nMARK But if you're frightened... \nHELEN Show me - or I'll remain frightened... for the rest of my life.  Show me! \nHe turns to his cine-camera, and picks it up. He releases the tripod. \nCAMERA HOLDS on Helen. She stands very still against the wall. Mark's voice is overlaid. \nMARK (O.S.) Do you know... what the most frightening thing in the world is?... \nShe is looking at something, puzzled. \nMARK It's fear. \nThe sound of his footsteps approaching... \nMARK So I did something... very simple... \nWE SEE a look of fear spring into her eyes. \nMARK Very simple. \nWE SEE the spike approaching her throat... but she is looking at something else. \nMARK When they felt the spike... touching their throats... and knew I was going to kill them... \nThe spike is touching her throat. \nMARK ... I made them - watch their own deaths! \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen's face several times its natural size. She is looking at herself in a large circular magnifying mirror which has been fitted over the camera's face. The mirror entirely obscures both Mark and the camera. There is a small hole in the mirror through which the lens of the camera winks. As Helen looks at her terrified distorted face this small hole gives her an extra eye in the middle of her forehead. \nMARK Made them see their own terror as the spike went in... and if death has a face, they saw that too! \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark - crouching behind the mirror, sweat pouring down his forehead... his finger on the trigger of the camera. \nMARK Not you! Not you! I'll never photograph you! I promised - I promised - Not you! \nHelen's eyes are closed. The spike is still touching her throat. \nCLOSE SHOT of Mark \u0097 his face turned away from the viewfinder. \nHELEN ... frightened ... for you... \nThere's the sound of a car pulling up. He hurries to the other room. \nEXT. HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe Police arrive: three cars.  Mark appears at an upstairs window with his camera. \nSERGEANT Look out! \nHe thinks Mark has a gun. They all duck. Mark raises his camera and photographs them. The Police recover and charge for the house. Mark disappears. \nINT. DARK-ROOM - NIGHT \nMark hurries back into the room carrying his camera. He knows exactly what he has to do. \nHELEN Mark! Mark! Give yourself up! \nMARK I've been ready for this... for such a long time... \nRapidly he fixes his camera on to a hook on the wall. Then he adjusts the tripod so that the spikes protrude towards him... \nHELEN What are you... \nMARK It'll be all right. \nHe makes chalk marks on the floor in front of the camera, then switches on all the floodlights. WE CAN HEAR the Policemen pounding on the door. \nMARK I can beat that! \nHe crosses to a switch - presses it.  The room is filled with a small boy's screaming. \nHELEN Give yourself up... Mark! \nHe stands next to her, and looks at his long array of cameras. WE SEE that each one of them has been fitted with a small metal disc (a delayed release), and that some of the older cameras have flashlights attached. \nMARK Watch them, Helen... Watch them say goodbye - one by one - (he presses a master switch on the wait) I've timed this... so often... \nSlowly he walks past his cameras. As he does, the metallic disc on each one explodes with a little plop - and the eye of each camera winks once as if in salute. Some go off with flashlights on either side of the room. The sound of footsteps hurrying up the stairs. \nAhead of Mark - coming steadily closer \u0097 are the spikes of the tripod. The mirror on the cine-camera reflects the approach - and Helen's terrified face. \nHELEN No - No! \nThe child's screaming reaches its peak as Mark approaches the spikes... Ahead of him, on the small table where his projector stands, is Helen's book The Magic Camera. \nMARK I wish... I could have found your faces for you... \nThe Policemen are now rattling on the dark-room door. \nMARK Helen - I'm afraid! \nWe see his face, terrified, in the magnifying mirror. The spikes are against his throat. The eye of the camera is winking rapidly. \nMARK I'm glad I'm afraid! \nHeavy shoulders are pressing against the dark-room door... as it breaks in, Mark lunges forward against the spikes. The cine-camera is wrenched away from the wall as he falls back. He crashes against the small table, which falls over. He is not parted from his camera - it is fixed to him by the tripod, and falls back with him, covering his face like a canopy. WE SEE his face in the lens of the cine- camera. and WE SEE his hand - lying limp on the cover of The Magic Camera. \nThe Policemen hurry into the room. They stare motionless at what they see. \nCLOSE SHOT of Helen - her face buried in her hands. \nThe child's screaming stops suddenly... and in the absolute silence which follows WE HEAR the voice of Mark's father: \nFATHER'S VOICE (O.S.) Don't be a silly boy... there's nothing to be afraid of... \nAnd a small voice answers. \nCHILD'S VOICE (O.S.) Good night, Daddy... \n", "test3_id": 407}

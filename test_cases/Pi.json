{"train": "Pi - By Darren Aronosfsky \nPi by \nDarren Aranofsky \nOriginally featured at: Screensource \nShooting Script September, 1996 \nTITLES EXPLODE TO WHITE \nSLOW FADE TO: \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP of MAXIMILIAN COHEN'S eyes popping open. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT -CHINATOWN FLAT \u0096 NEW YORK CITY - NIGHT \nMax jolts his head from his desk and tries to orient him-self in the darkness. He has intelligent eyes set in an exhausted, good-looking face. \nThen he notices the blood dripping from his nose. Max wipes it. \nMax's voiceover begins: \nMAX (V.O.) Monday, September first. Six-fifteen. \nINT. BATHROOM - DAWN \nA pull-string light flips on. Max examines his bloody nose in the mirror. \nMAX (V.O.) The alchemist awakes. (Imitating) \"Turn lead into gold, Max, lead into gold.\" Today, I find it. \nMAX (instantly) One hundred fifty-eight thousand, a hundred two. Right? \nJENNA (Eyes light up) Right. Max heads down the staircase. \nMOM Jenna... Jenna screams after him. \nJENNA Okay, seventy-three divided by twenty-two. \nMAX (instantly again) Three point three one eight one eight one eight... \nEXT. CHINATOWN - DAY Max watches people bustle through the busy intersections of Chinatown. The streets are clogged with people. \nMAX (V.O.) Somewhere in there. Somewhere. I know it's right in front of me. The pattern. They say it's chaos, it can't be understood, too much complexity. \nEXT. ELECTRONIC MEGADUMP - DAY Max scavenges electronic parts as he carefully navigates an endless dump for old and rotting computers. \nMAX (V.O.) History it's there. Lurking, shaping. structuring, hiding, right beneath the surface. \nHe unscrews a random IBM Board from a keyboard and slides it into his pocket. \nEXT PLAYGROUND \u0096 DAY MOVE IN on Max looking up at something as he reclines on a public bench. \nMAX (V.0.) The cycling of disease epidemics, the wax and wane of Caribou populations in the Arctic, sunspot cycles, the rise and fall of the Nile and yes! the New York Stock Exchange, they are all the same. MOVE IN on a tree branch - shaking gently in the wind. \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF STOCK TICKER Bright stock quotes drift across the screen. \nMAX (V.O.) I'll find this structure, this order, this perfection. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY Max stares intensely at the ticker on the small TV that sits next to his monitors. \nMAX (V.O.) Turn lead into gold. The first. Right here. Right here. With math. The numbers of the stock market are my lead. When I find the pattern, then I will find gold. Max watches the right edge of the screen where the numbers appear. He wants to see what's before that edge... \nMAX Leave me alone. His neighbors conversation begins to build in volume and distortion. \nFARROUHK (O.S.) So I drop them off in the Village and they dart. \nDEVI (O.S.) Oh God... Max gags and rubs his head. \nFARROUHK (O.S.) I get out, grab my bat and start running. One of the kids, maybe sixteen, I catch a block later he's cursing at me, calling me a Paki bastard. So I whacked him, right in the head. \nDEVI (O.S.) Farrouhk! The pain seems to disappear. Max looks at his hand that was rubbing his bead. \nThen he looks at the front door. The doorknob seems to move. Something begins knocking on Max's door. The knocking gets louder and louder then the locks begin to unlock. \nFARROUHK's words begin to overpower Max. \nFARROUHK (O.S.) I'm kicking the bastard in the ribs banging his ass, knocking his head against the curb, harder and harder, I fucking lost it. A hot dog guy starts screaming \"You're cracking his skull, you're cracking his skull.\" So they pulled me off of him and calmed me down. Cops said he had it coming to him. Then something starts pounding the door. The doorknob quivers, the locks unbolt. The chains are the only thing keeping out the intruder. The door shakes and the chains are strained. \nMAX is paralyzed with terror. \nMAX No! No! And then the door smashes open. Blinding light fills the room and we crash into the \nBLINDING WHITE VOID \nA moment of silence, then we CUT TO INT. BATHROOM - DAWN A phone rings incessantly. Max's eyes pop open. He's scrunched up in a corner of the room, squashed beneath the sink. \nHis nose is bleeding. \nMax, crawls into the MAIN ROOM \nand picks up the phone. He pinches his nose and tilts his head back. \nMARCY DAWSON Mr. Cohen. Marcy Dawson here again I was just looking over my schedule and I realized I'll be in your neighborhood tomorrow around three. \nMAX Okay. \nEXT. SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER TIGHT ON the Japanese game of Go being played. Sol is white and Max is black. Sol's moves are secure and controlled while Max is hesitant. \nSOL Stop thinking, Max, just feel. Use your intuition. It's the only way to get into the flow. (Beat) What did you think of Hamlet? MAX I didn't get to it. SOL It's been a month. (Knowingly) You haven't taken a single break. \nMAX I'm so close, Sol. I'm so close but I just can't grab it. Sol changes the subject. He feeds his goldfish and points to one of them. \nSOL Have you met the new fish my niece bought me? I named her Icarus. After you. My renegade pupil. You fly too high, you'll get burned. Max looks up at Sol. \nSOL The more I see you, the more I see myself thirty years ago. My greatest pupil. Published at 16, Ph.D. at 20. \nMAX We'll see. SOL But life isn't just mathematics. I spent forty years looking for patterns in Pi, I found nothing. \nMAX You found things... SOL I found things, but not a pattern. \nINT. MOVING TRAIL - DAY \nMax sits in the corner of a rickety New York City subway car. The train is almost completely deserted. \nMax looks down at his hand. He opens his palm and reveals a black Go chip. \nMAX (V.O.) Tuesday, September second, eighteen twelve. If Sol hadn't gotten sick who knows where math would be. He spent years in the numbers of Pi. Searching for meaning, for order. Max notices a SKINNY MAN in a business suit staring at him. The man catches Max's eye and looks away, but then he quickly looks back, making Max turn away. \nHe looks down at his Wall Street journal and draws a circle with its diameter then he writes \"A=pir2\" and \"C=2pir.\" Next he writes \"pi=3.14159...\" \nMAX (V.O.) Three point one four...off into infinity and maybe insanity. Somewhere in there he wanted sanity. Sanity like he found in the circles Pi represented. Simple, sane circles. If only the stock market had circles. Some type of sanity. Some type of form, of shape. \nSuddenly, Max hears someone singing. Max looks up. It is the Skinny Man and he's singing with passion. It's all very strange to Max, who nervously looks away. \nAnd then the singing stops\u0097 mid-verse Max looks up and the man is gone. Vanished. Max looks around\u0097no one in Sight. \nSatisfied, Lenny lights up a cigarette and takes a drag. \nMAX (Mildly impressed) Kind of interesting. LENNY MEYER (Proud of himself) Yeah, like take the Hebrew word for, say, the Garden of Eden, Kadem. Kuf, Dalei Mem...Kuf is a hundred. Daled, four Mem, forty. They equal one hundred and forty-four. Then take the tree of knowledge...in the garden, Aat Ha Haim, it equals two hundred and thirty-three. Now you can take that number and... \nMAX They're Fibonacci numbers. LENNY MEYER Huh? MAX The Fibonacci sequence. Italian mathematician, thirteenth century. If you divide a hundred and forty-four into two hundred and thirty-three, it approaches theta. \nLENNY MEYER Theta? MAX The Greek symbol for the golden ratio. The golden spiral. Lenny exhales the smoke. Max quickly graphs the number on his Wall Street Journal. \nLENNY MEYER You're right, I never saw that before. That's the series you find in nature. Like the face of a sunflower. \nMAX Wherever there's spirals. LENNY MEYER You see, there's math everywhere. Lenny's smoke drifts by Max's eyes. \nSLOW MOTION: MAX'S POV of smoke spirals spinning in front of him. \nMAX Math everywhere... SLOW MOTION: Max looks down at his coffee cup. He pours cream into his coffee. It shoots up and mixes with the black coffee forming spirals in the mug. \nMAX (Serious) Everywhere... SLOW MOTION: Max looks at the spiral he just drew on the Wall Street Journal. \nNORMAL SPEED Suddenly, Max stands up. \nMAX Oh my God... INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY \nMax draws spirals all over his Wall Street Journal. Then he takes a thick black marker and draws a giant spiral across the entire page. \nMax is ecstatic as he pounds code into the computer takes moments to wake up, drops pills, and drinks a Ginseng soda. \nMAX (V.O.) Simple shapes! Tuesday, September second. Twenty-twenty-two. Sol! Sol! Sol! Shapes in the market. Why not? And they're spirals! Spirals! \nMax traces a big circle on the journal. Then, he cuts it out with an X-acto blade. He cuts out the middle of the circle so that be has a thin loop like one of those futuristic frisbees. He tears part of the loop and stretches the circle out in front of him into a spiral. \nMAX (V.O.) A circle spread out overtime. It's open-ended. It has a beginning and it grows and changes through time. If I can find where it fits, if I can spin it and lock it into a group of numbers, then I can calculate the future. Lead into gold. Chaos into order Madness into sanity. Pain into bliss. Perfection. Max is about to slap RETURN but he stops himself\u0097he's nervous. \nHe crumples up his picks and tosses them into a public trash can. \nINT. SOL'S STUDY - DAY \nSol and Max play Go. Sol is peaceful while Max is distant. \nMax plays a piece absently. Sol counters with a deafening atari. Max whispers: \nMAX Euclid crashed. I lost all my data, my hardware. \nSOL Your mainframe? MAX Burnt... SOL What happened? MAX I don't know, first I got these horrible picks. Then Euclid spits out some numbers. Never saw anything like it and then it fries. The whole machine just crashed. SOL You have a printout? MAX Of? SOL The picks, the number? MAX I threw it out. SOL What was the number it spit out? \nMAX I don't know, just a long string of digits. \nSOL How many? MAX I don't know. SOL (Intense) What was it, a hundred and fifty, a thousand, two hundred sixteen!? How many? \nMAX I don't know. Probably around two hundred. (Wondering) Why? SOL (Beat)... I dealt with some bugs back in my Pi days. I was wondering if it was similar to one I ran into. \nSol begins to feed his fish. He points to one. \nSOL Have you met Archimedes. The one with the black spot. You see? MAX Yeah. SOL Remember Archimedes of Syracuse? The King asks Archimedes to determine if a present he's received was actually solid gold. Unsolved problem at the time. It tortures the great Greek mathematician for weeks. Insomnia haunts him and he twists and turns on his bed for nights on end. Finally, his equally exhausted wife, she's forced to share a bed with this genius, convinces him to take a bath, to relax. While stepping into the tub he observes the bathwater rise as he enters. Displacement. A way to determine volume. And thus, a way to determine density, weight over volume. And thus, Archimedes solves the problem. He screams \"Eureka!\"\u0097Greek for \"I found it!\"\u0097and is so overwhelmed he runs dripping naked through the streets to the King's castle to report his discovery. Now, what's the moral of the story. MAX That a breakthrough will come... \nSOL Wrong. The point of the story is the wife. Listen to your wife, she will give you perspective. Meaning, you need a break, Max, you have to take a bath, otherwise you'll get nowhere. There will be no order, only chaos. Go home and take a bath. PUBLIC BENCH - MOMENTS LATER Max waits for his train on an empty platform. \nJust then, he hears a DRIPPING sound. Max looks up and notices something across the tracks on the other platform. He can't quite make it out because his vision is blocked by columns. \nHe gets up and spots a Young Hasidic Man standing at him. \nBlood drips from the Man's hand. Max doesn't know what to make of it \nA TRAIN SWISHES BY - \nMARCY DAWSON I can't tell you what a pleasure it is to finally meet you. I've studied your papers for years. MARCY DAWSON I have something you won't be able to say no to. Why don't we take a spin in the limo? \nMAX No, no, no, really, I can't. \nMARCY DAWSON We're excited by your work. We can't wait to discuss... \nMax attempts to pull away but Marcy is firm on leading him to the car. Meanwhile, the Shinny man is heading right at them. \nThe CHAUFFEUR reaches out to him. Max yanks his arm free and runs away. He whips around a corner. \nINT. BODEGA - DAY Max barrels into the grocery store and buys a Journal. He heads to the back of the store and lays the paper across the juice section. He checks the listing. \nMAX On the nose. On the damn nose. Max turns the page on the Journal and sees the Lancet-Percy ad. Then he notices one of the bodega owners staring at him. \nEXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY \nMax scouts his front door. The coast is clear. INT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY \nMax examines the smashed Euclid mainframe. He uncovers some of the strange filo-like substance. He carefully touches it. Then he grabs a small pinch of it. \nHe examines it near a light bulb. He can't guess what it is. He sniffs it. He carefully tastes it with the very tip of his tongue. He still doesn't have a clue. \nMax opens his closet. He pulls out his dusty brass microscope. He dusts it off. Next, he pulls out a slide Kit. \nMax places the instrument on the windowsill. He grabs an old glass slide and puts some of the flaky stuff on it. He slides it under the microscope. He looks into the lens, but doesn't see anything. \nHe gets up quickly and heads for the HALLWAY \nwhere he looks at Devi's door, nervously. He gathers his courage and knocks on her door. Through the door hears. \nDEVI (O.S.) Farrouhk? MAX Um, no, it's Max from next door. Devi opens the door wearing a sexy nightshirt. \nThen an idea comes to him. He takes out his brain book. He looks through it until he finds a picture of neurons. He compares the image to the view through the turret. They look different but there are similarities. \nDEVI (O.S) Shh! Baby! Come here, baby! Max rushes out. \nEXT. PLAYGROUND - LATE AFTERNOON \nMax sifts through the trash can where he threw his picks from yesterday. Frustrated, he dumps the trash onto the sidewalk and starts looking through it Mrs. Ovadia watches him. \nMax sees her and is embarrassed for a moment. \nMAX I just threw out something. I didn't realize I needed it. \nMRS. OVADIA Humph. MAX Just a printout. I, uh, lost my data... \nMax looks back at the trash And forgets about Mrs. Ovadia. Soon, Max gets up and kicks the trashcan. He heads home. \nIN FRONT OF MAX'S APARTMENT BUILDING \nMax watches Marcy get out of the limo and call to Mrs. Ovadia. \nMax backs away when he smacks into someone. \nIt's Lenny Meyer - the young Jewish man. \nMax jumps back in fear. \nLENNY MEYER Max! How you doing? Lenny Meyer. MAX Oh, hey... Max tries to quickly pass him. \nLENNY MEYER Hey, where you going? You got a few moments to do Tefillin? \nMax turns around and notices Marcy talking to Mrs. Ovadia. Mrs. Ovadia points up the street toward him. \nDISSOLVE FROM TURRET TO: \nSATELLITE IMAGE OF SPINNING TORNADO \nStart in tight on the epicenter and pull out to reveal the entire storm. \nMAX (V.O.) Thursday, September fourth, sixteen forty-five. The alchemist awakes. All of my ideas, work and dreams are spinning together It all has to do with spirals. It began with spirals and the answers are thee. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT \u0096 DAY \nEUCLID'S INNARDS \nMax uses a drill to rip out some old parts. He lays new wire and does a bunch of soldering. \nHe rips down a bunch of old papers and does a general housecleaning. \nHe also goes to school on the ant population in his apartment. He plants some ant motels and sprays the room with. a pest killer. \nMAX (V.0.) The most I can remember about their significance is from Schneider's class. That bullshit core for majors. Schneider's fascination with mystical geometry made him a bit of a quack...but...then again, look at Kepler. He was really into Pythagoras. The leader of an ancient sect which believed the entire universe could be represented by numbers. Pythagoras' greatest contribution was the golden ratio, which ended up influencing art and science for thousands of years, arguably all the way up to today. TIGHT ON MAX writing a : b : : b : a + b. \nHe draws it over a copy of Leonardo Da Vinci's famous drawing of man s anatomy. \nMAX (V.0.) The golden ratio, if I recall, is this unique relationship between the length and width of a special rectangle called the golden rectangle. TIGHT ON MAX carefully measuring out a golden rectangle. \nThe rectangle fits perfectly over Leonardo Da Vinci's Man. \nMAX (V.O.) If you take the width of this rectangle and use it to form a square within the rectangle, the part left over is a rectangle that has the same ratio as the original rectangle. au can continue squaring the rectangle, over and over again, making the rectangles smaller and smaller to infinity. \nTIGHT ON MAX squaring rectangle after rectangle. Then he draws the golden spiral through the rectangles. \nMAX (V.0.) Then, if you connect a curve through these rectangles you get the golden spiral. The Pythagoreans loved this shape because they found it everywhere in nature. MONTAGE OF IMAGES \nMax flips to the stock quotes. He can't believe how far things have dovetailed. He shakes his head in disbelief when an envelope appears in front of him. It belongs to Lenny Meyer. \nLENNY MEYER The Torah. MAX What is it? LENNY MEYER In Hebrew characters and numbers. \nMAX No, what is it? The two hundred and sixteen digits. \nLENNY MEYER I don't know. (Beat) If you get it, maybe we can figure it out. (Changing subject) Can you really find it? MAX If the number's in there, I'll find it. \nEXT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nMax marches into his foyer when he's suddenly ambushed by Devi's boyfriend, Farrouhk. Farrouhk is a little guy with a big sadistic smile. \nHe grabs Max by the collar and slams him against the wall. His fist butts up against Max's chin. \nFARROUHK There you go, dork. Been thinking about my girlfriend. Haven't you? MAX Wha... FARROUHK You want to fuck her, don't you? MAX No, no.. FARROUHK You calling my girlfriend ugly!? Why don't you want to fuck her? You think she's ugly? MAX No, no, I just. It's that she's your girl... \nFARROUHK So you do want to fuck her. You think about fucking her in the mouth, don't you? \nMAX No, no, sir, please. I've never touched Devi...I never will. FARROUHK Give the fucking genius a Mars bar. Stay away, or I'll slice off your balls. Farrouhk tosses Max against the wall. Max whimpers off to his apartment. Farrouhk has enjoyed this and to end his game be gives Max a small slap on the butt. \nINSIDE HIS APARTMENT Max bolts the front door. \nAt his desk he rips open the envelope Lenny Meyer gave him. He pulls out a BLACK DISK and eyes it expectantly. \nNext door, he hears Farrouhk and Devi talking. \nFARROUHK (O.S.) Damn dork. DEVI (O.S.) He's just a bit unique. FARROUHK(0.S.) Unique?! Unique?! He's a dork! Then, Max carefully slips the DISK into Euclid's drive. Hebrew characters pop onto Euclid's screen. Max pounds in several strings of code lightning fast. \nThe Hebrew letters suddenly switch to their numerical counterparts. Max toggles between Hebrew and numbers a few times\u0097impressed. \nMax nods. Then there's a knock at the door. \nMAX Too much...too soon. He grabs the gun and tries to roll up his sleeve. He can't get it to roll up. Suddenly he's overwhelmed by pain. He quickly rips his shirt and fires the gun into his arm. \nNothing happens. He checks the barrel\u0097its empty \nMAX Ohh... He grabs a bottle of medicine but knocks them an into the sink. \nHe cuts his finger as be grabs one of the broken bottles. He loads the gun and fires the medicine into his arm. A wave of pain and nausea floods in. He grabs another bottle and fires it into his arm. Then he fires another and another. \nFrustrated he collapses into the mirror. \nMAX Stop, please, stop. Slightly sobbing he examines his scalp pulling his hair apart. He sees something. \nMAX What the? So he takes out a scissors and starts removing some hair. \nMeanwhile his neighbors' lovemaking gets more intense. Their screams carry into Max's head. \nMax finishes removing a patch of hair from the right side of his head. He has uncovered a light scar on his head. He examines it in the mirror. \nMAX What is it!? What is it!? Then his neighbors' lovemaking turns outright evil. It sounds like Sodom and Gomorrah next door and Max can barely stand it. A jolt of pain surges into his head. He grabs his scar as he vomits blood into the sink. He starts banging his head against the mirror. He bangs his head again and again until the mirror CRACKS! \nHis neighbors are cumming and their cries of joy are twisted and agonizing. \nThe mathematician looks at himself and begins to sob. He reloads the gun and fires it right into the scar on his head, where the pain is coming from. \nMax collapses to the ground in complete agony until the bare bulb in the bathroom starts blinking on and off. \nSuddenly the pain is gone. \nThen he hears something. It's Euclid, buzzing with life. He gets to his feet and head's into Euclid. \nThe main monitor is screaming with numbers. The lights in the room flicker on and off like on a disco dance floor. A filo substance billows out of Euclid. \nDEVI Are you okay? MAX Out! Get out! Max slams the door in their faces. Max rubs his chin and looks around the room. He starts saying the number to himself He gets more and more excited as he reads each digit. \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - NIGHT \nMax stirs cream into his coffee. Then he pulls out the Journal. \nA phone continues to RING. \nIn the clouds of the Lancet-Percy ad - in The Journal Max writes down the two hundred and sixteen digit number. He studies it, examines it, draws on it, tries to figure out what it is. \nMAX (V.O.) Saturday? Dark outside. There was a moment there...when, I don't know...when I didn't exist. What? What? \nWe hear a phone being picked up. The ringing stops. Silence, then: \nMARCY DAWSON (O.S.) Max, is that you? Max? (Pleading) Max, just talk to me. Things are a bit out of hand down here. People are getting desperate. (Suddenly firm) We had a deal, Max. A deal. Talk to us, Max. \nWe hear the sound of a phone hanging up. \nAt the coffee counter, Max pops a handful of pills and crumples the paper. \nINT. MAX'S BATHROOM - LATER \nMax stares at his BALD head in the mirror. All of his hair has been removed. A fleshy scar sits on his scalp above his right ear. \nMax ignores the incessantly RINGING phone. \nMax flips through an old neuroscience book. He examines a few illustrations and finds the part of his brain that's killing him. \nMAX (V.0.) Must be an explanation, must be a reason. Must. \nWith a thick black marker, he carefully outlines the part of his head that is causing the pain. \nSOL I gave up before I pinpointed it. But my guess is that certain problems cause computers to get stuck in a particular loop. The loop leads to meltdown, but right before they crash they... they become \"aware\" of their own structure. The computer has a sense of its own silicon nature and it prints out its ingredients. MAX The computer becomes conscious? SOL In some ways...I guess... MAX (To himself) Studying the pattern made Euclid conscious of itself. Before it died it spit out the number That consciousness is the number. \nSOL No, Max, it's only a nasty bug. \nSOL A door in front of a cliff. You're driving yourself over the edge. You need to stop. MAX Stop? How can I stop? I'm this close. \nSOL The bug doesn't only destroy computers. MAX What are you saying? SOL Look what it did to your computer. Look what it's doing to you. Max doesn't respond. SOL It's killing you. Leave it unknown. \nMAX (Clarity) You were afraid of it. That's why you quit. \nSOL Max, I got burnt. MAX C'mon, Sol. SOL It caused my stroke. MAX That's bullshit. It's math, numbers, ideas. Mathematicians are suppose to be out on the edge. You taught me that! SOL Max, there's more than math! There's a whole world... \nMAX That's where discoveries happen. We have to go out there alone, all alone, no one can accompany us. We have to search the edge. We have to risk it all. But you ran from it. You're a coward. SOL Max, it's death! Max stands up and screams down at Sol. \nMAX You can't tell me what it is. You don't know You've retreated to your goldfish, to your books, to your Go, but you're not satisfied. Sol grabs his cane and whacks the Go board. \nSOL Get out! Max, get out! MAX I want to understand it. I want to know! \nSol swings his cane as Max heads for the door. \nSOL Out! INT. SUBWAY - PORT AUTHORITY - NIGHT Max paces on a downtown train as it pulls into 42nd Street. \nThrough the open doors, Max notices a YOUNG PHOTOGRAPHER in jeans and a leather jacket photographing him from the uptown platform. \nMax is enraged and screams at him. The man ducks behind a column, but a few moments later he's back snapping pictures. \nThe doors start to shut, but Max uses his body to get off the train. \nThe Photographer sees him coming and flees. \nMax follows the man's movement on his platform. When the young man shoots up the exit stairs, Max does so as well. \nMAX Marcy? What's up? Max retreats. \nMARCY DAWSON Let's take a ride, Max. MAX I can't, I got work... Max looks back at the tough guys who are almost on top of him. \nMARCY DAWSON We had a deal! NOW get in the limo! Marcy releases a vicious slap that nearly knocks Max down. Max whimpers. \nMAX Don't ever hit... He pushes Marcy aside and darts. \nEXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT Max flees. Jake and Brad charge after him. They're right on him - he has a meter or so on them. He scurries through a construction site and over a footbridge. \nThen, he runs into an all-night BODEGA \nThe tough guys chase after him and he gets a bit of a lead in the narrow aisles. He pleads with the owners for help - nothing doing. \nJake heads him off and uses his body to block the aisle. But Max grabs a can of beans and slams it down on the tough guy's nose. The guy goes down and Max shoots out the exit. \nEXT. UNDERNEATH CAR - NIGHT Max dives under a car and crawls for terror. He sees two sets of feet nun by. Max starts to relax when he notices a pair of heels on the other side of the car. Marcy bends down and looks at him. \nMARCY DAWSON Enough, Max, c'mon out. MAX Leave me alone. I don't know anything. \nMax retreats in the opposite direction. Suddenly Jake and Brad grab him and drag him out. \nMAX Hey! Hey! Hey! They search him, taking his wallet, keys, everything. \nMarcy looks at the guys, who shake their heads. She walks over to Max and shows Max the front page of the Wall Street Journal. It reads, \"MARKET CRACHES\" \nMARCY DAWSON You're responsible for this. MAX I didn't do anything. I didn't play the market. \nMARCY DAWSON But we did. Marcy pulls out a folded, worn piece of paper. She opens it. It's Max's stock pick that he threw out. Part of THE number is on the page \nMARCY DAWSON You have to be careful where you throw out your trash. \nMAX Farrouhk what about Farrouhk!? LENNY MEYER Stay down! Ephraim pushes Max's head down. Yisrael takes another corner sharp. \nMAX Go back! LENNY MEYER He's okay, he got in his cab. We've been looking for you. MAX What's going on? LENNY MEYER Do you have the number? MAX What's going on? LENNY MEYER Do you have the number? MAX Yeah, I have it! LENNY MEYER You have it. Where is it? You have it written down? \nMAX What is it? Lenny nods to Ephraim, who starts scanning through Max's pockets. Max resists. The other guys hold him down. \nMAX What are you doing!? What the hell are you doing!? \nLENNY MEYER We're not joking around, Max? Where's the number? MAX (Pushing Ephraim away) It's not on me. It's in my head. \nLENNY MEYER You memorized it? Did you give it to them? \nMAX Who? LENNY MEYER Who!? Those Wall Street bastards. \nMAX Why do you care? LENNY MEYER Just answer me! MAX Screw you! LENNY MEYER (In Hebrew) Hit him! Yisrael screeches the car to a halt. He spins around in his seat and looks Max in the face. \nLENNY MEYER You're dealing with something really big now, Max. I don't want to hurt you, so answer me. Did you give it to them? \nMAX They've got part of it Now get off me! \nLENNY MEYER Damn it! Damn it! They're using it. \nMAX Using what? LENNY MEYER Shut up! MAX Let go! Max chews into Ephraim's hand which is pinning him. Ephraim screams and lets loose a punch to Max's jaw. \nLENNY MEYER No, don't! But Lenny is late, and Max's world - as well as ours goes black. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT Max stares suspiciously at the bathroom. He slowly picks up his drill. Wielding it like a hammer, he carefully advances into the BATHROOM where he looks into the sink. He almost vomits when he sees a piece of human brain sitting above the drain. Ants swarm across its surface. \nMax becomes furious. He whacks it with the drill. Blood flies up into his face. In a wild rage, he smashes it and punches it. \nThen he drops the drill and uses his bare hands to shove it down the drain. Screaming like a madman, he jams it until it is gone. \nLENNY MEYER We're pure. Give us the number! \nMAX The number is nothing. You know that! \nRAV COHEN We can use it. We can wield it. \nMAX It's just a number. I'm sure you've written down every two hundred sixteen number. You've translated all of them. You've intoned them all. Haven't you? But what's it gotten you? It's not the number! It's the meaning. It's the syntax. It's what's between the numbers. If you could understand you would. But it's not for you! I've got it. I understand it. I'm going to see it! (Whispers to Rav Cohen) Rabbi...I was chosen. EXT. CITY STREETS - DAY \nMax races through the streets of New York. He is wide-eyed. \nMAX (V.0.) Suddenly, it's all there. It all makes sense. I can crack it. I can know it. I know what it is. Sol knows, too. I need to tell him. I need to show him. I need to bring him with me. People fly by. Max in a spiraling whirlwind. \nEXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA pumped and excited Max paces the hall as he rings the bell. \nThe door opens. But it isn't Sol. It's a young, beautiful woman wearing a simple black dress. Her name is JENNY ROBESON and she is Sol's niece. \nJENNY ROBESON Can I help you? MAX (Confused) Sol? JENNY ROBESON Were you a friend? MAX What do you mean? JENNY ROBESON He had a second stroke. MAX Where is he? Jenny's eyes drop. \nMAX No. Max rushes into Sol s study. The room is covered with Sol's P, research books. It seems Sol had recently come out of retirement. Max looks at a few of Sol's books. Then he finds a piece of paper with Sol's handwriting on it. On the paper is THE number. Max slides it into his pocket. \nMax looks at the Go board. The pieces are arranged in a giant spiral across the board. \nDISSOLVE TO \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY \nMax sits on his bed staring at Sol's handwritten number. Then he notices that his thumb is twitching. He drops Sol's note. \nMAX Stop it, please! \nDEVI (O.S.) No, Max. No. Stay with me Max. Stay with me. And then we cut back to THE MAIN ROOM where Devi grabs Max's palm. Max's fingers wrap around her hand. We return to THE BLINDING WHITE VOID where Max stops reciting the number. He suddenly opens his fear filled eyes. \nMAX Where am I? What is this? This is wrong, Sol. Sol! Max lets out a 'SOL!, and reaches out into the void. We match cut back to THE MAIN ROOM \nwhere Max grabs Devi and hugs her. He gasps for air as he collapses into her arms, sobbing. \nMAX Sol! You were right Sol! He was right. \nDEVI That's right Max. That's Right. Breathe. Breathe. \nMAX He was right. I want to breathe. Breathe. \nDEVI Yes, breathe, Max. Breathe... \nMax sobs. He holds onto her for dear life \nAnd then be realizes that Devi is not in his arms. He is holding onto himself. \nThen Max notices Sol's note on the ground. He looks at the number. He collects himself and catches his breath. \nINT. MAX'S BATHROOM \u0096 DAY \nMax looks at Sol's note. He lights a match and burns it. \nNext, he prepares something in the sink. \nWe hear the WHINE of a motor. Then it stops, Max looks at himself in the mirror, He smiles. Then he gets solemn. \nHe takes a deep breath. Then we hear the motor again. Max lifts up his arm. He's holding a drill. He places the bit against the math section of his scalp. \nHe applies pressure and drills into his brain. \n", "test1_input": "DEVI Your hair. Devi hands the bags to Max. Then she goes to pat down his Hair. Max retreats. \nMAX What are you doing? DEVI Your hair, you can't go out like that. Don't worry. MAX It's fine. It's fine. Devi pats down his hair. Max is humiliated. DEVI You need a mom. Max hands back the bags and heads quickly for the stairs. MAX I have to go. DEVI Your somosas! An embarrassed Max takes the bag. \nMAX Thanks. INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nAt the counter, Max stirs cream into his coffee. Then he takes three pills from the plastic bottle and drops them in his coffee. \nMax flips past a full-page ad in the paper that reads LANCET-PERCY 86% ACCURACY (ONLY GOD IS PERFECT). Max flips the page before he or we can absorb it. He compares stock quotes in the Wall Street Journal against his printout. \nMAX (V.O.) Sixteen, twenty-seven. Results: Euclid shows tomorrow's Dow closing up by four points. Anomalies include PRONET at sixty-fire and a quarter, a career high. Possible explanations, either A, an error in the June fifth algorithm, or B, Euclid's main processor is running a recursion... \nMax marks up the paper with lines and diagrams as he ponders his bits and misses. \nThen a puff of cigarette smoke drifts by and succeeds in bothering Max. He fans it away when\u0097 \nVOICE FROM OFFSCREEN Oh sorry, am I bothering you? Max shrugs and looks over. \nThe voice belongs to LENNY MEYER\u0097a bearded man in his late 20s sucking on a cigarette. \nOn closer inspection, something is off. It seems that Lenny is an Orthodox Jew. His yarmulke sticks out Slightly from his wide-brimmed hat and the fringes from his tsi-tsis hang out from the bottom of his untucked shirt. \nLENNY MEYER I'll put it out. (Which he does) The name's Lenny Meyer Lenny sticks out his hand. Max responds with a small nod. LENNY MEYER And you are? MAX Max. LENNY MEYER Max? MAX Max Cohen. LENNY MEYER Cohen! (Judging) Jewish? Max shrugs and turns back to his work. \nLENNY MEYER It's okay. (Joking) I'm a Jew, too. (Serious) Do you practice? \nMAX No, I'm not interested in religion. \nLENNY MEYER Have you ever heard of Kabbalah? \nMAX No. \n", "test1_true": "MAX (Sarcastic) Really? LENNY MEYER Yes, it's very exciting. Have you ever put on Tefillin? \nMax has no idea what Lenny's talking about. Lenny pulls a leather box with black leather straps from his pocket. \nLENNY MEYER Tefillin. You know Tefillin. I know it looks strange. But it's an amazing tradition that has a tremendous amount of power. It's a mitzvah for all Jewish men to do. Mitzvahs, good deeds, are spiritual food for our hearts and our heads. \nAnd then Max notices that his thumb is twitching He grabs it self-consciously. \nLENNY MEYER They purify us and bring us closer to God. You want to try it? \nJust then, Max pays his bill and prepares to leave. \nMAX I gotta go... LENNY MEYER Are you okay? Max? Max? MAX I'm sorry, bye. LENNY MEYER Well, maybe some other time. INT. MAX'S BATHROOM - NIGHT Max splashes water on his face. \nMAX Please God, Let it be a small one. \nHe pulls a metal vaccinating gun out of the medicine cabinet. Then be loads it with a small bottle of medicine. He rolls up his sleeve, dabs alcohol on his arm, and fires the gun into his arm. \nMAX (V.O.) Sixteen thirty-five. Second headache in under twenty-four hours. They're getting more frequent now...more painful, too. Drugs don't work, just take the edge off of it. Just gotta wait for the nosebleed. Relief comes from my nose. Next door, he hears Devi and her boyfriend talking. \nFARROUHK (O.S.) So I gotta make this drop off in Harlem and on the way down there's these three kids hailing me. \nMax slaps himself in the face a few times. \nDEVI (O.S.) You stopped? FARROUHK (O.S.) I was tight, so... Max watches his thumb twitch. And then pain shoots through him. He grabs the right side of his head, massages it, and pushes it in with his fingers. \nIn the mirror, he examines the right side of his scalp. He sees nothing \nMAX Ahh... Max walks back into the MAIN ROOM \nand sits down in a chair. The lamp is blinding so he snaps it off. Only the bathroom light lights the room. He takes a few breaths. \n", "test2_input": "Max firmly rings SOL's bell. \nIn a few moments, Sol answers the door in his pajamas. \nSOL Max? MAX What's going on, Sol!? SOL Relax, it's early. INT. SOL'S KITCHEN - MOMENTS LATER Max sits at the kitchen table while Sol heats up a pot of tea. Max is shaking. \nSOL Now, what's up? MAX What's the two hundred and sixteen number, Sol? \nSOL Excuse me? MAX You asked me if I had seen a two hundred and sixteen digit number, right? SOL Oh, you mean the bug. I found it working on Pi. \nMAX What do you mean by \"found it\"? SOL What's this all about, Max? \nMAX Well, there's these religious Jews who have... \nSOL Religious Jews? MAX Well, you know, Hassidim. I met one in the coffee shop. The guy's a number theorist. The Torah is their data set. The thing is, they're searching for a two hundred and sixteen digit number in the Torah. \nSOL Really? What's it mean to them? \nMAX They say they don't know, but that's crazy. I mean what are the odds... SOL It's just a coincidence. MAX But hold on, there's something else. You remember those strange picks I got. SOL Yesterday's stock picks? MAX Right. Well, it turns out that they were correct. I hit two picks on the nose. Smack on the nose. \nSOL (Surprised) Hmmm. MAX Something's going on, and it has to do with that number. The answer is there. SOL Max, it's a bug. MAX No. it's a pattern. A pattern is in that number \nSOL Come with me. INT. SOL'S STUDY - MOMENTS LATER Sol and Max sit on either side of a half-played Go board. \nSOL Listen to me. The Ancient Japanese considered the Go board to be a microcosm of the universe. Although when it is empty it appears to be simple and ordered, in fact, the possibilities of game play are endless. They say that no two Go games have ever been alike. Just like snowflakes. So, the Go board actually represents an extremely complex and chaotic universe. That is the truth of our world, Max. It can't be easily summed up with math. There is no simple pattern. MAX But as a Go game progresses, the possibilities become smaller and smaller. The board does take on order. Soon, all moves are predictable. \nSOL So? MAX So, maybe, even though we're not sophisticated enough to be aware of it, there is an underlying order...a pattern, beneath every Go game. Maybe that pattern is like the pattern in the market, in the Torah. The two sixteen number. \nSOL That is insanity, Max. MAX Or maybe it's genius. I have to get that number. \nSOL Hold on, you have to slow down. You're losing it, you have to take a breath. Listen to yourself. You're connecting a computer bug I had, a computer bug you might have had, and some religious hogwash. If you want to find the number two sixteen in the world, you'll be able to pull it out of anywhere. Two hundred and sixteen steps from your street comer to your front door. Two hundred and sixteen seconds you spend riding on the elevator. When your mind becomes obsessed with anything, it will filter everything else out and find examples of that thing everywhere. Three hundred and twenty, four hundred and fifty, twenty-three. Whatever! You've chosen two sixteen and you'll find it everywhere in nature. But Max, as soon as you discard scientific rigor, you are no longer a mathematician. You become a numerologist. What you need to do is take a break from your research. You need it. You deserve it Here's a hundred dollars, I want you to take it. If ,you won't take it, borrow it. Either way, take a break. Spend it however you like as long as it falls in the category of vacation. Real world stuff, okay. No math. \n", "test2_true": "SOL Just try it. In a week you'll laugh about this. C'mon, Max. Think about it! Max gives a half nod. \nEXT. SOL'S APARTMENT - MORNING \nMax rushes to the subway when a honking horn stops him. A limo pulls up next to him. Marcy Dawson jumps out of the car \nMARCY DAWSON Mr. Cohen? Mr. Cohen? Please stop for a second Mr. Cohen? Max stops and faces Marcy. \nMAX Damn it already! Stop following me. I'm not interested in your money. I'm searching for a way to understand our world. I'm searching for perfection. I don't deal with mediocre materialistic people like you! MARCY DAWSON I'm sorry. I'm very sorry. I admit I've been a bit too aggressive. But all I ask is for five minutes of your time. Here... Marcy hands Max a metal stopwatch. MARCY DAWSON ...a stopwatch. Already ticking. Allow me the four and a half minutes left Let me tell you what I want. Let me tell you what I can offer you. Afterwards, if you don't want to talk to me, then fine, we part as friends and I promise that you will never see me again. That's fair, isn't it? MAX (After a moment, he looks at the stopwatch) Go. MARCY DAWSON Good. It's funny, even though we have different aims and different goals we're actually incredibly alike. We both seek the same thing\u0097perfection. I know... clearly we're seeking different types of perfection, but that is what makes us perfect candidates for a fruitful partnership. If you let me, I can be your greatest ally. Take the acacia tree...in East Africa. It is the most prevalent plant in all of Kenya because it has managed to secure its niche by defeating its major predator, the giraffe. To accomplish this, the tree has made a contract with a highly specialized red ant. The tree has evolved giant spores which act as housing for the ants In return for shelter, the ants supply defense. When a giraffe starts to eat the tree's leaves, the shaking branch acts like an alarm. The ants charge out and secrete an acid onto the giraffe's tongue. The giraffe learns its lesson and never returns. Without each other, the tree would be picked dry and the ants would have no shade from the brutal African sun Both would die. But with each other, they succeed, they survive, they surpass. They have different aims, different goals but they work together. Max, we would like to establish a mutually benefiting alliance with you. MAX (handing back the stopwatch) I'm not interested. MARCY DAWSON Allow me to dose. The chauffeur pulls a black suitcase out of the limo and brings it over. \nMARCY DAWSON As a sign of good faith we wish to offer you this. \nMAX I told you I don't want money. MARCY DAWSON The suitcase isn't filled with fifties or gold or diamonds. Just silicon. A Ming Mecca chip. MAX (Yeah right!) Ming Mecca. They're not declassified. Max starts to move away. \nMARCY DAWSON You're right. They're not. But Lancet-Percy has many friends. Come here, take a look. MAX (Stuttering) What do...do... But then, Max notices that his thumb is twitching. \nMARCY DAWSON Beautiful, isn't it? You know how rare...are you okay? \nMAX Yeah, I got to go. MARCY DAWSON But what about... MAX Let me think about it... Max trots off. \nMARCY DAWSON What? Mr. Cohen!? INT. SUBWAY STATION - PUBLIC BENCH - NIGHT \nThe station is strangely silent. It is also extremely rundown. The tracks are rusted and fucked up. All we hear is the sound of DRIPPING WATER. The sound is warped and grows and morphs until it's downright scary. \nMax sits on a bench sucking down pills. His head begins to hurt. He touches the right side of his scalp and nubs it. \nAs the blood surges through his head it brings him waves of pain. He gags several times. Then the pain lets loose and all Max wants to do is die. He smashes the side of his head with his fist. \nAcross the tracks on the far platform he sees someone. \nFor a moment Max's pain dissipates. His view is obscured by the columns. Max gets up and sees the Young Hasidic Man - from earlier - staring at him. The Man stares at Max without any emotion. Max notices blood dropping from the Man's right hand. \n", "test3_input": "Max looks at the Man's face and sees for a split second his own face staring back. \nMAX Hey! Max charges up a flight of stairs. He crosses a passage over the tracks and flies down the stairs to the other side of the platform. \nThe Man is gone. A pool of blood sits where the Man was. Max touches it with his toe. It's sticky. He notices a trail of blood leading off from the pool. He follows it around a corner where it leads into a corner. \nHe notices something strange in the shadows. He carefully advances on it. Hiding in the shadows is what looks like a small piece of brain. It seems to be moving slightly. \nMax uses a pen in his jacket to carefully touch it. \nSuddenly, Max hears a train's HONK HONK behind him. Max spins around. Nothing is there but silence. \nHe turns back to the gray matter. He touches it again. Once again, he hears the deafening HONK HONK. Max spins around, but nothing is there. \nFrustrated, he pushes his pen deep into the brain - fiber ripping apart. \nSuddenly, a TRAIN is barreling down on Max. Seconds from impact, Max SCREAMS!!! \nDISSOLVE TO \nBLINDING WHITE VOID We hear two deep, long sleep-filled breaths and then we CUT TO: \nINT. SUBWAY TRAIN - DAY \nMax's eyes pop open. A TRANSIT COP is sticking him with a nightstick. \nTRANSIT COP Up, buddy Coney Island, last stop. Max sits up. His nose is bleeding. The cop hands him a tissue. \nTRANSIT COP Your nose. Max wipes his nose and looks around nervously. \nHe sees the rides of Coney Island in the distance. \n", "test3_true": "Max sits on a boulder on a Coney Island jetty. He watches the sea. \nThen Max sees an old man dressed like KING NEPTUNE scanning the shore with a rusty metal detector. The old man picks up something. He admires it for a moment before gently setting it back on the ground. Then Neptune continues his search. \nMax wanders over to the place where the old man exam \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - NIGHT MAX'S POV through the microscope. Max sees the brain structures. \nJust then, there's a KNOCK on the door. The knock startles him and his hand bumps the turret of the microscope. The lens moves and he realizes that the magnification can be changed. \nA KNOCK again. \nMax looks out the peephole and sees nothing. Confused, \nLooks down at his thumb. It's not shaking. He heads back to his microscope. \nThere's a knock again. Max angrily unlocks the door and whips it open. \nIN THE HALLWAY is Jenna with her calculator. \nJENNA Max, Max, can we do one. MAX Jenna. I can't now, Jenna. JENNA Please, Max. MAX I'm working now, later okay? Max shuts the door and returns to the microscope. He changes the magnification. At a weaker magnification, the mathematician sees that the cells are grouped in spirals. \nMax is stunned, He grabs the phone and pulls a business card out of his pocket He quickly dials a number. \nSomeone answers with a \"Shalom\" on the other end of the line. Max asks for Lenny Meyer and is put on hold. \nLENNY MEYER Hello, this is Lenny? MAX Lenny, it's Max Cohen. LENNY MEYER Max! How are you? You want to come down? MAX I've been thinking about our conversation earlier. \nMax looks into the microscope. He stares at the spirals. \nLENNY MEYER That's good... MAX I want to help. LENNY MEYER Excellent. MAX Do you have the Torah in digital form? \n"}

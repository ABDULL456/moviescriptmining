CHINATOWN - DAY Max watches people bustle through the busy intersections of Chinatown. The streets are clogged with people. \nMAX (V.O.) Somewhere in there. Somewhere. I know it's right in front of me. The pattern. They say it's chaos, it can't be understood, too much complexity. \nEXT. ELECTRONIC MEGADUMP - DAY Max scavenges electronic parts as he carefully navigates an endless dump for old and rotting computers. \nMAX (V.O.) History it's there. Lurking, shaping. structuring, hiding, right beneath the surface. \nHe unscrews a random IBM Board from a keyboard and slides it into his pocket. \nEXT PLAYGROUND \u0096 DAY MOVE IN on Max looking up at something as he reclines on a public bench. \nMAX (V.0.) The cycling of disease epidemics, the wax and wane of Caribou populations in the Arctic, sunspot cycles, the rise and fall of the Nile and yes! the New York Stock Exchange, they are all the same. MOVE IN on a tree branch - shaking gently in the wind. \nSLOW DISSOLVE TO EXTREME CLOSE-UP OF STOCK TICKER Bright stock quotes drift across the screen. \nMAX (V.O.) I'll find this structure, this order, this perfection. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT - DAY Max stares intensely at the ticker on the small TV that sits next to his monitors. \nMAX (V.O.) Turn lead into gold. The first. Right here. Right here. With math. The numbers of the stock market are my lead. When I find the pattern, then I will find gold. Max watches the right edge of the screen where the numbers appear. He wants to see what's before that edge... \n", "test1_true": "The phone starts ringing. Max eyes it suspiciously. \nJust then, Euclid starts printing results on an old dot- matrix printer. \nMax suspiciously answers The phone. \nMAX Hello? WOMAN'S VOICE Maximilian Cohen, please.

MARCY DAWSON I'm prepared to make you a generous... \nMax hurries to wrap up the conversation. \nMAX I don't take offers for my research. You know that. Sorry, I Couldn't help you. MARCY DAWSON Mr. Cohen, give me a moment... \nBut before Marcy finishes, Max hangs up. He rips off the printout and heads to the front door. \nHe checks the peephole, His landlady. MRS. OVADIA, is sweeping the hallway stairs humming a turn-of-the century (the last one, not this one) tune. \nMax waits a moment. He tousles his hair. Then he checks again. She's gone. He opens his locks and releases several bolts. \nINT.MAX'S BUILDING HALLWAY - DAY \nMax locks his front door. Meanwhile, his next-door neighbor, DEVI MINSTRY, a sexy young Indian woman, is just getting home. Max looks away and tries to get his door locked. \nShe's weighted down by a bunch of bags filled with food. \nDEVI Max, good! MAX Hi, Devi. DEV1 I grabbed you some somosas. MAX Great.

Thursday, September fourth, sixteen forty-five. The alchemist awakes. All of my ideas, work and dreams are spinning together It all has to do with spirals. It began with spirals and the answers are thee. \nINT. MAX'S APARTMENT \u0096 DAY \nEUCLID'S INNARDS \nMax uses a drill to rip out some old parts. He lays new wire and does a bunch of soldering. \nHe rips down a bunch of old papers and does a general housecleaning. \nHe also goes to school on the ant population in his apartment. He plants some ant motels and sprays the room with. a pest killer. \nMAX (V.0.) The most I can remember about their significance is from Schneider's class. That bullshit core for majors. Schneider's fascination with mystical geometry made him a bit of a quack...but...then again, look at Kepler. He was really into Pythagoras. The leader of an ancient sect which believed the entire universe could be represented by numbers. Pythagoras' greatest contribution was the golden ratio, which ended up influencing art and science for thousands of years, arguably all the way up to today. TIGHT ON MAX writing a : b : : b : a + b. \nHe draws it over a copy of Leonardo Da Vinci's famous drawing of man s anatomy. \nMAX (V.0.) The golden ratio, if I recall, is this unique relationship between the length and width of a special rectangle called the golden rectangle. TIGHT ON MAX carefully measuring out a golden rectangle. \nThe rectangle fits perfectly over Leonardo Da Vinci's Man. \nMAX (V.O.) If you take the width of this rectangle and use it to form a square within the rectangle, the part left over is a rectangle that has the same ratio as the original rectangle. au can continue squaring the rectangle, over and over again, making the rectangles smaller and smaller to infinity. \nTIGHT ON MAX squaring rectangle after rectangle. Then he draws the golden spiral through the rectangles. \nMAX (V.0.) Then, if you connect a curve through these rectangles you get the golden spiral. The Pythagoreans loved this shape because they found it everywhere in nature. MONTAGE OF IMAGES \n", "test2_true": "MAX (V.0.) It really is amazing. In the sea, on land, in air, our basic building block DNA and even our home. EXT. CHINATOWN - DAY \nMax wanders through the crowded streets of Chinatown. \nMAX (V.O.) If we're built from spirals, while living within a giant spiral, is it possible that all of human behavior, if it could be quantified, is in the form of a spiral. Then, maybe, extensions of our behavior like the stock market. maybe even the writing of The Torah, is infused with the spiral pattern. \nDISSOLVE TO PAN ACROSS NEW EUCLID \nWe start on the stock ticker and pull out to reveal a leaner, meaner and more exciting machine. \nMAX (V.O.) Friday, September fifth. Seven twelve. It's fair to say, I'm stepping out onto a limb. But I'm on the edge and that's where it happens. He holds two wires apart from each other as he contemplates what will connect them. \nEXT. ELECTRONIC MEGADUMP - DAY \nMax wanders helplessly through the dump. There's nothing but junk and more junk. \nEXT. PUBLIC PAY PHONE - DAY Max eyes Marcy Dawson's business card, suspiciously He dials the number. A man answers on the other line. \nMAN'S VOICE (OS.) Three, eight, two. MAX Marcy Dawson. MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Who's calling? MAX Max Cohen. MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Hold on. Max is put on hold. He notices a man in a business suit watching him.

MAX I don't know if I'll find anything useful. \nMARCY DAWSON We're willing to take the risk. MAX Okay. First, I want you to call off the surveillance. MARCY DAWSON (Beat) Done. Anything else? MAX Yeah, I'm a very private person. Knock on my door and leave the suitcase outside. I don't want to talk to Anyone. \nMARCY DAWSON How do I know you're home? MAX I'll knock back.

And then we cut back to THE MAIN ROOM where Devi grabs Max's palm. Max's fingers wrap around her hand. We return to THE BLINDING WHITE VOID where Max stops reciting the number. He suddenly opens his fear filled eyes. \nMAX Where am I? What is this? This is wrong, Sol. Sol! Max lets out a 'SOL!, and reaches out into the void. We match cut back to THE MAIN ROOM \nwhere Max grabs Devi and hugs her. He gasps for air as he collapses into her arms, sobbing. \nMAX Sol! You were right Sol! He was right. \nDEVI That's right Max.

JACK No, of course... 
JENNY I have an education to pursue. 
58   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE. EVENING                               58 
Graham, Jenny and her father are at the dinner table, sitting in the dark. Marjorie kicks the door open with her foot and comes in holding a birthday cake with seventeen candles burning on it. She puts it down carefully on the table. 
JACK Blow them out, then, before the whole place burns down. 
Jenny closes her eyes, makes her wish, blows out her candles. Her father and mother both look at her, apparently attempting to read her mind. Jack gets up to turn the lights on. We can see that by Jenny's side are two unopened, carefully-wrapped presents, both exactly the same size - clearly books. 
MARJORIE Who'd like a piece? 
In truth, the cake is a rather sorry and unappetising specimen. There isn't enough icing on the top. She cuts a couple of slices which immediately collapse. 
GRAHAM Never mind. I'll have one of those. 
JACK Come on. Presents. 
Without any real enthusiasm, Jenny opens the first one of the two, from her mum and dad. It's a Latin dictionary. 
JENNY Oh. Thank you. I    needed a new one. 
GRAHAM (crestfallen) Oh dear. 
The doorbell rings. Jenny perks up. Jack goes to answer it, and immediately the house is energised: it's David. 
58A   INT/EXT JENNY'S HOUSE                                       58A 
Jack answers the door to David. 
58B   INT. JENNY'S HOUSE                                          58B 
JACK (O.S.) Good grief. You won't believe this, Jenny. Did you leave anything in the shop? 
David enters. You can hardly see him for all the parcels and flowers he's carrying. 
DAVID It's a special day. 
He and Jenny exchange a glance. Jack comes in behind him. 
JACK She's a special girl. 
DAVID Oh, I know it. (to Graham) Hello, young man. 
JENNY This is Graham. 
DAVID Graham, a pleasure. I'm David. 
They shake hands. Graham suddenly looks five years younger. 
JACK Makes your dictionary look a bit feeble, eh Graham? 
Graham looks pained. Marjorie notices. 
MARJORIE And ours too, come to that. 
JACK Well, we're not the ones trying to impress her. 
JENNY Clearly. 
JACK David, what can I get you to drink? 
DAVID What's everybody else having? What have you got there, Graham? 
JACK I've given him a glass of pop. 
GRAHAM (stung) I'd better be going I have a stack of homework to do. 
Graham says his goodbyes. He tries to catch Jenny's eye, but she looks away. Marjorie shows him to the door. 
DAVID Yes. Well. You can put the pop away now. What is there for the grown-ups? 
JACK A glass of something warming? 
DAVID You know me so well. 
Hearty laughter from the two men. 
JENNY Can I open anything yet?

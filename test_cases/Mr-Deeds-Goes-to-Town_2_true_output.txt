The smartest thing I ever did was to make that trip. 
BUDINGTON 
(anxiously) 
John, did you get the - uh 
39. MED. SHOT - GROUP 
Favoring Cedar. 
CEDAR 
(interrupting) 
No, Budington, I didn't get the Power of Attorney. But don't worry, I will. 
(beaming to his brothers) 
I asked him last night what he was going to do with the money, and what do you suppose he said? 
THE TWO BROTHERS 
(gathering around him) 
What? 
I can't imagine. 
CEDAR 
He said he guessed he'd give it away. 
THE TWO BROTHERS 
(laughing) 
Give it away!? 
The boy must be a nit-wit! 
Budington hasn't enjoyed the joke - his mind still on their problem. 
ONE OF THE BROTHERS 
Well, John, you had the right hunch! 
BUDINGTON 
John, if you don't mind my saying so - we can't afford to 
CEDAR 
(irascibly) 
I know, Budington. We can't afford to have the books investigated right now. You must have said that a thousand times already. 
BUDINGTON 
But what if they fall into somebody else's hands, why - uh 
CEDAR 
Well, it hasn't happened yet - has it? 
BUDINGTON 
(wailing) 
But a half million dollars! My goodness, where are we going to get 
CEDAR 
(exploding) 
Will you stop worrying! It was I who got old man Semple to turn everything over to us, wasn't it? And who got the Power of Attorney from him ! All right, and I'll get it again! 
(pause - change of tone) 
I'll take it easy. Those books'll never leave this office. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. AN APARTMENT 
40. MEDIUM SHOT 
George Semple, a ne'er-do-well, prominent for the pouches under his eyes and a perpetual nose-twitch, is sprawled out in a chair reading a newspaper. A nagging wife walks around him. 
WIFE 
A yokel! Nothing but a yokel! Your uncle must have been mad to leave all that money to him! You're as closely related to him as he is, and what did you get? 
She storms around the room. George merely twitches his nose but says nothing. 
WIFE 
(slaps the paper George is reading) 
I say, what did you get? 
GEORGE 
Stop yelling. Can I help it if my uncle didn't like me? 
WIFE 
I told you to be nice to him. Ten years we've been waiting for that old man to kick off. And then we were going to be on Easy Street. Yeah - on Easy Street! 
GEORGE 
Oh, shut up! It's too late now, and you're a nuisance! 
WIFE 
That's just what I'm going to be - a nuisance. I'm going to be a nuisance until I get hold of some of that money! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. EDITOR'S OFFICE, DAILY MAIL 
41. FULL SHOT 
The editor stands in front of his desk. Four of five reporters in front of him - several photographers. In the b.g., leaning against the wall near the door, apparently indifferent, is Babe Bennett. The editor, Mac, is haranguing them. 
MAC 
(as he blows his nose) 
He's news! Every time he blows his nose, it's news. A corn-fed bohunk like that falling into the Semple fortune is hot copy . . . But it's got to be personal. It's got to have an angle. What does he think about? How does it feel to be a millionaire! Is he going to get married! What does he think of New York! Is he smart? Is he dumb? . . . A million angles! 
42. CLOSE SHOT - BABE 
She has a string in her hand which she keeps flicking, trying to get a knot into it - in the manner of cowboys with a rope. Mac's voice continues over scene: 
43. MEDIUM SHOT 
Of them all, as Mac continues: 
MAC 
He's been here three days, and what have you numbskulls brought in! Any halfwit novice could have done better! 
REPORTER'S VOICE 
Yeah, we tried too 
MAC 
Am I talking too loud? Or annoying anybody? 
REPORTER 
You know Corny Cobb. He's keeping him under lock and key. 
MAC 
Cobb, Cobb! Never mind about Cobb. Use what little brains you've got! Find out something yourselves, you imbecilic stupes! Now get out of here before I really tell you what I think of you. Come on, get out! 
They scramble to their feet. One of the reporters mumbles something as he passes Mac on the way to the door. 
REPORTER 
(Mumbles.) 
MAC 
(alert) 
What was that? 
REPORTER 
(thinking fast - covering up) 
Huh? I said you had dirty plaster. 
44. MED. CLOSE SHOT AT DOOR 
As Babe is still flicking her string, trying to get a knot. The reporters file past her on their way out. Just as the last one is approaching, she succeeds in doing the trick. 
45. MEDIUM SHOT 
As Mac turns to Babe. 
MAC 
You too! Thought I could depend on you, but you're getting as bad as the rest of them. 
He grabs up a handful of papers and starts out. 
BABE 
(flicking the string) 
Look, I can do it! 
MAC 
What's gotten into you, Babe? I remember the time when you'd blast this town wide open before you'd let Cobb get away with a thing like this. 
46. CLOSE TWO SHOT 
BABE 
Oh, he's not getting away with anything. 
MAC 
(excited) 
Listen, Babe - get me some stuff on this guy, and you can have 
BABE 
Can I have a month's vacation? 
MAC 
With pay! 
BABE 
With pay!

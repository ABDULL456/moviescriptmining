{"train": "FEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS \nFEAR & LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS \nby \nTerry Gilliam & Toy Grisoni \nBLACK SCREEN \nA desert wind moans sadly.  From somewhere within the wind comes the tinkly, syrupy-sweet sounds of the Lennon Sisters singing \"My Favorite Things.\" A series of sepia images of anti-war protests from the mid-sixties appear one after another on the screen. \nIn the violently scrawled style of Ralph Steadman, the title FEAR AND LOATHING IN LAS VEGAS splashes onto the screen.  A beat, and then it runs down and off revealing: \nTITLE: \"He who makes a beast of himself Gets rid of the pain Of being a man.\" Dr. Johnson \nThe VOICE OF HUNTER S. THOMPSON -- a.k.a. RAOUL DUKE: \nDUKE (V/O) We were somewhere around Barstow on the edge of the desert when the drugs began to take hold. \nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! \nA red Chevy convertible -- THE RED SHARK -- wipes the black screen. \nEXT. ON THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY \nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! \nTHE RED SHARK races down the desert highway at a hundred miles an hour.  THE STONES' \"Sympathy For the Devil\" blares. \nAT THE WHEEL \nSTRANGELY STILL AND TENSE, RAOUL DUKE DRIVES -- SKELETAL, BEER IN HAND -- STARES STRAIGHT AHEAD. \nBESIDE HIM, FACE TURNED TO THE SUN, EYES CLOSED BEHIND WRAPAROUND SPANISH SUNGLASSES, IS HIS SWARTHY AND UNNERVINGLY UNPREDICTABLE ATTORNEY, DR. GONZO. \nThe music pounds DUKE stares straight ahead.  GONZO froths up a can of beer - uses it as shaving foam. \nDUKE (V/O) I remember saying something like: \"I feel a bit lightheaded.  Maybe you should drive...\" \nGONZO starts shaving. \nDUKE (V/O) Suddenly there was a terrible roar all around us and the sky was full of what looked like huge bats, all swooping and screeching and diving around the car... \nClose on DUKE -- shadows flutter across his face.  The reflections of bats swirl within his eyes.  We push in close to one eye ball -- SCREECHING SWIRLING BAT-LIKE SHAPES! \nAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRGGGGGGGGGGHHHHHH!!!!!!!! \nDUKE (V/O) ... and a voice was screaming: Holy Jesus!  What are these goddamn animals? \nCUT TO WIDE SHOT OF CAR - \nDUKE, eyes rigid, flails at the air.  No bats anywhere. GONZO casually looks over... \nGONZO What are you yelling about? \nDUCK SCREECHES to the side of the road.  The sudden wrench makes GONZO nick his face with his razor. \nDUKE Never mind.  It's your turn to drive. \nDUKE (V/O) No point mentioning these bats.  I thought.  The poor bastard will see them soon enough. \nDUKE hops out of the car, keeping an eye out for bats, frantically opens the trunk to reveal what looks like A MOBILE POLICE NARCOTICS LAB.  DUKE desperately rifles through the impressive stash. \nDUKE (V/O) We had two bags of grass, seventy- five pellets of mescaline, five sheets of high powered blotter acid, a salt shaker half full of cocaine, a whole galaxy of multi- colored uppers, downers, screamers, laughers... Also a quart of tequila, a quart of rum, a case of beer, a pint of raw ether and two dozen amyls. \nDUKE, eyes darting madly as he hears what sounds like the SHRIEKS OF BATS returning, grabs an assortment along with another six-pack of beer - slams the trunk shut and dives back into the car. \nDUKE (V/O) Not that we needed all that for the trip, but once you get locked into a serious drug collection, the tendency is to push it as far as you can. \nTHE RED SHARK RACES INTO THE DISTANCE... on the ground, weakly flapping is a SEMI-SQUASHED, SLOWLY DYING ANIMAL... A BAT? \nDUKE (roaring over the road noise) THERE'S ONE THING YOU SHOULD PROBABLY UNDERSTAND -- \nThe HITCHHIKER stares at him, not blinking. \nDUKE (yells) CAN YOU HEAR ME? \nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- terrified.  DUKE climbs into the back seat. \nDUKE That's good.  Because I want you to have all the background.  This is a very ominous assignment -- with overtones of extreme personal danger.  I'm a Doctor of Journalism! This is important, goddamnit!  This is a true story!... (WHACKS the BACK OF THE DRIVER'S SEAT with his fist) \nThe CAR SWERVES SICKENINGLY, then straightens out. \nGONZO (screams) Keep your hands off my fucking neck! \nThe HITCHHIKER makes a sudden lunge for freedom.  DUKE GRABS HIM BACK DOWN. \nDUKE (V/O) Our vibrations were getting nasty -- but why?  Was there no communication in this car?  Had we deteriorated to the level of dumb beasts? \nThe HITCHHIKER STRUGGLES IN PANIC. \nDUKE (to HITCHHIKER) I want you to understand that this man at the wheel is my attorney! He's not just some dingbat I found on the Strip.  He's a foreigner.  I think he's probably Samoan.  But it doesn't matter, does it?  Are you prejudiced? \nHITCHHIKER Hell, no! \nDUKE I didn't think so.  Because in spite of his race, this man is extremely valuable to me.  Hell, I forgot all about this beer.  You want one? (HITCHHIKER shakes his head) How about some ether? \nHITCHHIKER What? \nDUKE Never mind.  Let's get right to the heart of this thing.  Twenty-four hours ago we were sitting in the Pogo Lounge of the Beverly Wills Hotel... \nINT. THE BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL POGO LOUNGE 1971 - DAY \nA uniformed DWARF, carries a shockingly PINK TELEPHONE through the glittering, tranquil POGO LOUNGE CROWD.  They are the ELOI.  HENDRIX AFROS and DROOPING MUSTACHES and BELL BOTTOMS and LOVE BEADS and BELLS.  ACTRESSES sip Singapore Slings and PROMOTERS sip ACTRESSES in this MONIED, SANITISED VERSION OF THE GREAT REVOLUTION YEARS. \nDUKE (V/O) ... in the patio section, of course, drinking Singapore Slings with mescal on the side, hiding from the brutish realities of this foul year of Our Lord, 1971. \nThe DWARF reaches DUKE -- T-shirt, levis, sneakers and shades.  GONZO -- white rayon bellbottoms and a khaki tank top undershirt.  They are in the middle of a serious conversation. \nDUKE I'm telling you, the Salazar story is getting too complicated.  The weasels have started closing in. \nThe DWARF sneers. \nDWARF Perhaps this is the call you've been waiting for all this time, sir... \nDUKE lifts the receiver -- listens... \nDUKE Uh-huh... Uh-huh... Uh-huh... \nDUKE hangs up the PHONE with the DEAD-PAN EXPRESSION OF A MOVIE SPY. \nDWARF That was headquarters.  They want me to go to Las Vegas at once and make contact with a Portuguese photographer named Lacerda.  He'll have the details.  All I have to do is check into my sound proof suite and he'll seek me out. \nGONZO, says nothing for a moment, then POUNDS the table! \nGONZO God hell!  I think I see the pattern!  This one sounds like real trouble!  You're going to need plenty of legal advice before this thing is over.  As your attorney I must advise you that you'll need a very fast car with no top and after that, the cocaine.  And then the tape recorder, for special music, and some Acapulco shirts... (GONZO tucks his khaki undershirt into his white bellbottoms -- he means business!) This blows my weekend, because naturally I'll have to go with you -- and we'll have to arm ourselves. \nDUKE Why not?  If a thing's worth doing, it's worth doing right. \nDUKE and GONZO are up and off.  The DWARF chases after them with the (very large) check in his hand. \nThey sweep out through the Lounge door, unaware of it swinging back into the face of the pursuing DWARF. \nDUKE I tell you, my man.  This is the American Dream in action!  We'd be fools not to ride this strange torpedo all the way to the end. \nGONZO Indeed.  We must do it.  What kind of story is this? \nEXT. BEVERLY WILLS HOTEL - FRONT ENTRANCE - DAY \nDUKE and GONZO emerge. \nDUKE The Mint 400!  The richest off-road race for motorcycles and dune- buggies in the history of organized sport! (handing parking ticket to Valet) -- a fantastic spectacle in honor of some fatback grossero who owns the luxurious Mint Hotel in the heart of downtown Vegas... at least that's what the press release says. \nDUKE (V/O) We spent the rest of that night rounding up materials and packing the car.  Then we ate some mescaline and went swimming. \nThe surf crashes in the distance... \nEXT. PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT \nDUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself float up through the silvery bubbles... \nDUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING MOONLIT SURF. \nDUKE (V/O) Our trip was different.  It was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character; a gross, physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country.  But only for those with true grit... \nEXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY \nDUKE's intense face. \nDUKE ...and we're chock full of that! \nGONZO Damn right! \nDUKE My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?! \nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified. \nDUKE (V/O) He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't.  He was lying to me. \nGONZO My heart! \nGONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and screeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel. \nGONZO (CONT'D) Where's the medicine? \nDUKE The medicine?  Yes, it's right here. \nDUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin. \nDUKE Don't worry, this man has a bad heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we have a cure for it. \nDUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The HITCHHIKER looks petrified. \nGONZO (suddenly flailing his naked arms at the sky) Turn up the fucking music!  My heart feels like an alligator! Volume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must have bass!  What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies? \nDUKE (turns up music to full volume) You scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch your language!  You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism! \nGONZO (laughing uncontrollably) What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police!  We need help! \nDUKE (to HITCHHIKER) Pay no attention to this swine.  He can't handle the medicine. (he begins laughing) \nGONZO (to the HITCHHIKER) The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry.  I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right? \nGONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around. \nGONZO (CONT'D) Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out! \nDUKE And eat them!  That bastard won't get away with this!  What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism? \nGONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL. \nThe HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID, AND FLEES. \nHITCHHIKER Thanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot. I like you guys.  Don't worry about me. \nDUKE (yells) Wait a minute!  Come back and have a beer! \nThe HITCHHIKER RUNS from car. \nGONZO Good riddance.  That boy made me nervous.  Did you see his eyes? (laughing) Jesus, this is good medicine. \nDUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER. \nDUKE (suddenly clambering into the front seat) Move over!!  We have to get out of California before that kid finds a cop! \nHer face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING... \nDUKE (shouts) NO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING YET! \nThe FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS. DEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE. \nGONZO I can handle this.  This man has a bad heart, but I have plenty of medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo. Prepare our suite at once.  We'll be in the bar. \nGONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks back -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green jowls and fangs. \nINT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY \nThe bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme. DUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the wall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone... \nGONZO (to the bartender) Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side. (opens the envelope) Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor? \nDUKE Lacerda? \nDUKE (V/O) I couldn't remember.  The name rang a bell, but I couldn't concentrate. Terrible things were happening all around us... \nDUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY onto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low. \nDUKE Order some golf shoes.  Otherwise, we'll never get out of this place alive.  It's impossible to walk in this muck -- no footing at all... \nDUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared. \nDUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER. \nDUKE (V/O) I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo.  And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things!  It won't be long before they tear us to shreds! \nGONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER. \nGONZO If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators. \nGONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying... as he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to keep him in his line of vision. \nGONZO I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda.  I told him I knew what he was up to... (GONZO rallies -- turns fierce) He says he's a photographer!  But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked!  He knows we're onto him! \nDUKE But what about our room?  And the golf shoes? \nA GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at them, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS. \nDUKE (CONT'D) (grabbing GONZO trying to hold him still) Holy shit!  Look at that bunch over there!  They've spotted us! \nCut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing next to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality. GONZO is sitting in his original position. \nGONZO (downs his drink -- gets up) That's the press table.  Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with.  You handle that, and I'll check on the room. \nDUKE No, no.  Don't leave me! \nBlack screen. \nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK \nA TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK, protesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous BELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on the floor next to DUKE. \nBELL BOY Four club sandwiches, four shrimp cocktails. \nDUKE There's a big... machine in the sky... some kind of electric snake... \nDUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon sign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million colored lights. \nBELL BOY ... a quart of rum... \nDUKE ... coming straight at us. \nGONZO Shoot it. \nDUKE Not yet.  I want to study its habits. \nBELL BOY ... and nine fresh grapefruit. \nDUKE See...\"Kill the body and the head will die\"... the Frazier/Ali fight... \nMAGAZINE REPORTER A proper end to the 60's... Ali beaten by a human hamburger! \nDUKE And both Kennedy's murdered by mutants. \nA SHOUT goes up from outside.  The sound of engines revving. \nREPORTER That's it!  They're starting! \nIn a sudden rush the PRESS CROWD make for the door taking DUKE with them. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nMOTORCYCLES REV -- tension builds... \nA flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The MOTORCYCLES ROAR AWAY.  A great cloud of dust goes up -- obscuring the RACERS as they disappear into the desert... \nA moment... \nREPORTER Well, that's that.  They'll be back in an hour or so.  Let's go back to the bar. \nThe CROWD turns and streams back into the tent. \nINT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY \nDUKE heads for the bar along with the REST.  It's packed. Drinks are ordered. \nA shout from outside the tent goes up: \nVOICE OFF Group 2! \nThe CROWD rushes for the door.  DUKE gets swept along. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nMOTORCYCLES REV.  A flag goes down.  The CROWD cheers.  The MOTORCYCLES ROAR AWAY.  Another great cloud of dust goes up... \nThe CROWD head back for the bar. \nINT. RACE BAR TENT - DAY \nThe CROWD surge back to the bar. \nVOICE OFF Group 3! \nThis time DUKE fights his way free of the CROWD. \nDUKE (V/O) There was something like 190 more bikes waiting to start.  They were due to go off 10 at a time every 2 minutes. \nDUKE hits the bar. \nDUKE Beer! \nA middle-aged HOODLUM in a T-shirt booms up to the bar. \nHOODLUM God damn!  What day is this -- Saturday? \nDUKE More like Sunday. \nHOODLUM Hah!  That's a bitch, ain't it? Last night I was home in Long Beach and somebody said they were runnin' the Mint 400 today, so I says to my old lady, \"Man, I'm goin'.\" So she gives me a lot of crap about it, so I start slappin' her around, and the next thing you know two guys I never seen before are beating me stupid. \nVOICE OFF Group 4! \nOutside, another batch of motorcycles roar away -- kicking up more clouds of dust. \nHOODLUM Then they gave me ten bucks, put me on a bus, and when I woke up here I was in downtown Vegas, and for a minute all I could think was, \"O Jesus, who's divorcing me this time?\" But then I remembered, by God!  I was here for the Mint 400. And, man, I tell you, it's wonderful to be here.  Just wonderful to be here with you people. \nA silence.  A MAGAZINE REPORTER lunges across the bar -- grabs the BARTENDER. \nMAGAZINE REPORTER Senzaman wassyneeds! \nDUNE BUGGY DRIVER Where's the damn race? \nDUKE Beats me.  We're just good patriotic Americans like yourself. \nDUKE gives DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A NICE BIG GRIN.  In response, the PASSENGER #2 narrows his eyes -- tightens his grip on an automatic weapon. \nDUNE BUGGY DRIVER (suspiciously) What outfit you fellas with? \nDUKE The sporting press.  We're friendlies.  Hired geeks. \nThe DRIVER and DUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 exchange looks. \nDUKE If you want a good chase, you should get after that skunk from CBS News up ahead in the black jeep. He's the man responsible for that book, THE SELLING OF THE PENTAGON. \nDUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #1 HOT DAMN! \nDUNE BUGGY PASSENGER #2 A black jeep, you say? \nAnd they ROAR away. \nDUKE Take me back to the pits. \nLACERDA No, no -- we have to go on.  We need total coverage. \nDUKE gets out of the Bronco. \nDUKE You're fired. \nAfter a moment's hesitation, LACERDA and the BRONCO driver roar away leaving DUKE alone in the cloud of dust. \nDUKE (V/O) It was time.  I felt, for an Agonizing Reappraisal of the whole scene.  The race was definitely under way.  I had witnessed the start; I was sure of that much. But what now? \nEXT. LAS VEGAS STREETS - NIGHT \nMUSIC PUMPS OUT.  CRUISING IN THE RED SHARK IN VEGAS.  THE SKY SWIRLS WITH MILLIONS OF NEON LIGHTS CHASING EACH OTHER IN BAROQUE PATTERNS ACROSS GIGANTIC HOTEL SIGNS.  PSYCHEDELIC LIGHT SHOWS TO LURE AND DERANGE THE INNOCENT.  CITY OF LOST SOULS. \nDUKE Turn up the radio!  Turn up the tape machine!  Roll the windows down.  Let's taste this cool desert wind!  Aaah, yes!  This is what it's all about! \nDUKE, beer in hand, drives -- a big smile for the world. GONZO scans The Vegas Visitor. \nDUKE (V/O) Total control now.  Tooling along the main drag on a Saturday night in Vegas, two good old boys in a fire apple red convertible... stoned, ripped, twisted... Good people! \nGONZO How about \"Nickel Nick's Slot Arcade?\" \"Hot Slots,\" that sounds heavy.  Twenty-nine cent hotdogs... \nDUKE Look, what are we doing here?  Are we here to entertain ourselves, or to do the job? \nGONZO To do the job, of course.  Here we go... a Crab Louie and quart of muscatel for twenty dollars! \nThe Shark hits a bump. \nGONZO As your attorney I advise you to drive over to the Tropicana and pick up on Guy Lombardo.  He's in the Blue Room with his Royal Canadians. \nThey hit another bump. \nDUKE Why? \nGONZO Why what? \nCUT to wide shot.  They are DRIVING AROUND IN CIRCLES in a large casino parking lot, bumping over the dividers. \nDUKE Why should I pay out my hard-earned dollars to watch a fucking corpse. I don't know about you, but in my line of business it's important to be Hep. \nEXT. DESERT ROOM HOTEL - NIGHT \nTWO BIG SCREAMING FACES. \nDOORMAN #1 What the hell are you doing?! \nDOORMAN #2 You can't park here! \nDUKE Why not?  Is this not a reasonable place to park? \nEXT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT \nInto the GLARING, CHASING LIGHTS of the entrance canopy steps DUKE in EC/U holding a KLEENEX SOAKED IN ETHER TO HIS NOSE. \nDUKE (V/O) Ah, devil ether.  It makes you behave like the village drunkard in some early Irish novel... total loss of all basic motor skills; blurred vision, no balance, numb tongue -- (throws away kleenex) The mind recoils in horror, unable to communicate with the spinal column.  Which is interesting, because you can actually watch yourself behaving in this terrible way, but you can't control it. \nDUKE and GONZO approach the entrance with elaborate care- taking one step at a time -- trying to keep ahead of the drug. \nDUKE (V/O) You approach the turnstiles and know that when you get there, you have to give the man two dollars or he won't let you inside... but when you get there, everything goes wrong. \nTHE ETHER KICKS IN: \nDUKE and GONZO BOUNCE off the walls, CRASH into OLD LADIES, GIGGLE HELPLESSLY as they try to pay -- HANDS FLAPPING CRAZILY, unable to get money out of their pockets. \nDUKE (V/O) Some angry Rotarian shoves you and you think: What's happening here? What's going on?  Then you hear yourself mumbling. \nDUKE (mumbling) Dogs fucked the Pope, no fault of mine.  Watch out!... Why money?  My name is Brinks; I was born... Born? \nGONZO Get sheep over side... women and children to armored car... orders from Captain Zeep. \nThe ATTENDANTS indulgently escort them through the TURNSTILES. \nDUKE (V/O) Ether is the perfect drug for Las Vegas.  In this town they love a drunk.  Fresh meat.  So they put us through the turnstiles and turned us loose inside. \nINT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS CASINO - NIGHT \nFlames shoot up from below the casino.  Above, a HIGH WIRE ACT with FOUR MUZZLED WOLVERINES, SIX NYMPHET SISTERS FROM SAN DIEGO, TWO SILVER PAINTED POLACK BROTHERS, and THREE KOREAN KITTENS. \nThe WOLVERINE chases a NYMPHET through the air.  TWO POLACKS swing at it from opposite sides and they are instantly locked in a death battle. \nAll plummet to the nets suspended over the GAMBLING TABLES and SLOT MACHINES.  No one looks up.  The GAMBLERS REMAIN INTENT ON THE SPINNING ROULETTE WHEEL, THE TURN OF THE CARD, THE ROLL OF A DICE. \nDUKE (V/O) Bazooko Circus is what the whole hep world would be doing Saturday night if the Nazis had won the war. This was the Sixth Reich. \nSomething causes DUKE to look down.  A dwarf carrying drinks on a tray is tugging DUKE's pants leg trying to get him to move out of the way. \nDUKE (V/O CONT'D) A drug person can learn to cope with things like seeing their dead grandmother crawling up their leg with a knife in her teeth but, nobody should be asked to handle this trip. \nGONZO and DUKE go upstairs walking past funhouse booths. One of them is manned by an orangutan in costume.  A FAIRGROUND BARKER grabs DUKE. \nFAIRGROUND BARKER Stand in front of this fantastic machine, my friend.  For just 99 cents your likeness will appear 200 hundred feet tall on a screen above downtown Las Vegas. \nOn a TV monitor a 200 FOOT HIGH DRUNKARD looms over the Las Vegas skyline screaming OBSCENITIES. \nFAIRGROUND BARKER 99 cents more for a voice message. Say whatever you want, fella. They'll hear you, don't worry about that.  Remember, you'll be 200 feet tall! \nANOTHER BARKER Step right up!  Shoot the pasties off the nipples of this ten-foot bull-dyke and win a cotton candy goat! \nINT. BAZOOKO CIRCUS REVOLVING MERRY-GO-ROUND BAR - NIGHT \nDUKE and GONZO sit on the revolving platform.  GONZO stares -- glassy eyed -- coming apart. \nGONZO I hate to say this, but this place is getting to me.  I think I'm getting The Fear. \nDUKE Nonsense.  We came here to find the American Dream, and now we're right in the vortex you want to quit. You must realize that we've found the Main Nerve. \nGONZO That's what gives me The Fear. \nDUKE Look over there.  Two women fucking a Polar Bear. \nGONZO Please, don't tell me those things... Not now. (signals the waitress for two Wild Turkeys) This is my last drink.  How much money can you lend me? \nDUKE Not much.  Why? \nGONZO I have to go. \nDUKE GO? \nGONZO Yes.  Leave the country.  Tonight. \nDUKE Calm down.  You'll be straight in a few hours. \nDUKE locks the door.  The suite is crowded with ROOM SERVICE GOODIES.  DUKE turns to see GONZO staring at two hotel room keys.  EVERYTHING STOPS. \nGONZO Where did this one come from? \nDUKE snatches a key. \nDUKE That's Lacerda's room. \nGONZO smiles a slow smile... \nGONZO Yeah... I thought we might need it... \nDUKE What for? \nGONZO snatches the key back. \nGONZO Let's go up there and blast him out of bed with the fire hose. \nDUKE No, we should leave the poor bastard alone.  I get the feeling that he's avoiding us for some reason. \nGONZO Don't kid yourself.  That Portuguese son of a bitch is dangerous.  He's watching us like a hawk. \nDUKE He told me he was turning in early... \nGONZO utters an anguished cry -- slaps the wall with both hands. \nGONZO That dirty bastard!  I knew it! He's got hold of my woman! \nDUKE (laughing) That little blonde groupie with the film crew?  You think he sodomized her? \nGONZO That's right, laugh about it!  You goddamn honkies are all the same! \nGONZO SLASHES A GRAPEFRUIT with a HUGE RAZOR SHARP HUNTING KNIFE.  DUKE blanches. \nDUKE Where'd you get that knife? \nGONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- MANIACAL. \nGONZO Room service sent it up.  I wanted something to cut the limes. \nGONZO SLICES THE GRAPEFRUIT -- INTO EIGHTHS! \nDUKE What limes? \nGONZO SLICES -- SIXTEENTHS! \nGONZO They didn't have any.  They don't grow in the desert. \nSLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE! \nGONZO That dirty toad bastard!  I knew I should have taken him out when I had the chance.  Now he has her. \nSLICE!  SLICE!  SLICE!  GONZO SLASHES INSANELY! \nDUKE watches -- straight-faced. \nDUKE (V/O) I remember the girl.  We'd had a problem with her in the elevator a few hours earlier: my attention had made a fool of himself. \nINT. ELEVATOR - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nAn elevator door opens to reveal the SMILING FACES OF LACERDA, THE BLONDE TV REPORTER AND HER CREW. \nDUKE and GONZO stagger in. \nLACERDA drops his smile.  He's standing beside the BLONDE TV REPORTER.  A trembling GONZO moonily turns his eyes onto her. \nBLONDE TV REPORTER (to Gonzo) You must be a rider.  What class are you in? \nGONZO Class?  What the fuck do you mean? \nBLONDE TV REPORTER What do you ride?  We're filming the race for a TV series -- maybe we can use you. \nINT. MATRIX MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nStill in slow motion, the YOUNGER DUKE is trying to eat a HUGE SPANSULE OF ACID.  With difficulty. \nDUKE (V/O) I decided to eat only half at first. Good thinking.  But I spilled the rest on the sleeve of my red Pendleton shirt. \nDUKE stares at his sleeve, uncertain what to do.  C/U of the door to the men's room as a MUSICIAN enters speaking in slow-motion. \nMUSICIAN What's the trouble? \nDUKE (also in slow-motion) Well, all this white stuff on my sleeve is LSD. \nThe MUSICIAN approaches and looks down at DUKE'S arm.  A long pause. \nCut back to tight shot of door as it opens and a very clean- cut, PREPPY, STOCKBROKER TYPE enters.  He freezes in horror. We cut to his POV.  DUKE is standing in the middle of the men's room with the MUSICIAN hunkered down at his side... sucking on his sleeve.  A very gross tableau.  The STOCKBROKER slowly eases out of the room. \nDUKE (V/O) With a bit of luck his life was ruined -- forever thinking that just behind some narrow door in all his favorite bars, men in red Pendleton shirts are getting incredible kicks from things he'll never know. \nINT. A BAR - YEARS LATER - NIGHT \nThe STOCKBROKER LOOKING CONSIDERABLY OLDER sits looking lost, confused, a nervous wreck.  The image flares out in a TV white noise snowstorm. \nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nDUKE sits staring at the TV. \nDUKE (V/O) Strange memories on this nervous night in Las Vegas. (he gets up, pours himself a drink) Has it been five years?  Six?  It seems like a lifetime -- the kind of peak that never comes again. San Francisco in the middle sixties was a very special time and place to be a part of.  But no explanation, no mix of words or music or memories can touch that sense of knowing that you were there and alive in that corner of time and the world.  Whatever it meant. \nDUKE throws open the curtains.  Light streams in. \nEXT. 1965 STOCK FOOTAGE \nWe are in SAN FRANCISCO.  IMAGES OF THE TIME FLOOD IN. \nDUKE (V/O) THERE WAS MADNESS IN ANY DIRECTION, AT ANY HOUR... YOU COULD STRIKE SPARKS ANYWHERE.  THERE WAS A FANTASTIC UNIVERSAL SENSE THAT WHATEVER WE WERE DOING WAS RIGHT, THAT WE WERE WINNING.  AND THAT, I THINK, WAS THE HANDLE -- THAT SENSE OF INEVITABLE VICTORY OVER THE FORCES OF OLD AND EVIL.  NOT IN ANY MEAN OR MILITARY SENSE; WE DIDN'T NEED THAT.  OUR ENERGY WOULD SIMPLY prevail.  We had all the momentum; we were riding the crest of a high and beautiful wave... \nDUKE'S FACE IS SUFFUSED WITH A SADNESS AND SERENITY WE HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE. \nDUKE (V/O) So now, less than five years later, you can go up on a steep hill in Las Vegas and look west, and with the right kind of eyes you can almost see the high water mark -- that place where the wave finally broke and rolled back. \nThe memories dissolve into the night skyline of Vegas. Suddenly towering over the casinos is a 200 foot high Nazi shouting \"WOODSTOCK \u00dcBER ALLES!\" \nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nDUKE closes the curtain.  The room is in darkness again. \nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DAWN \nA harsh door buzzer.  DUKE jerks awake.  Alone.  Looking like shit.  Around him is the wreckage of their stay. \nDUKE (V/O) The decision to flee came suddenly. Or maybe not. \nDUKE opens the door to a BELL BOY with a trolley load of fruit, drinks and flowers... and a smile. \nBELL BOY Room service! \nThe BELL BOY wheels the trolley across the room -- already stacked with EVEN MORE BOXES OF GOODIES. \nDUKE (V/O) Maybe I'd planned it all along -- subconsciously waiting for the right moment.  The bill was a factor, I think.  Because I had no money to pay for it. \nDUKE slams the door -- starts FRANTICALLY PACKING. \nDUKE (V/O) Our room service tabs had been running somewhere between $29 and $36 per hour, for forty-eight consecutive hours.  Incredible. How could it happen? \nDUKE sees the DISCARDED WRAPPINGS OF EXPENSIVE, HAND TOOLED LUGGAGE.  A sudden thought.  He rushes to GONZO's room -- empty.  His plastic briefcase remains on the bed... \nDUKE (V/O) But by the time I asked this question, there was no one around to answer. \nDUKE opens the briefcase -- finds the .357 MAGNUM inside. \nDUKE (V/O) My attorney was gone.  He must have sensed trouble. \nDUKE You degenerate pig! \nGONZO It can't be helped.  This is Lucy. (laughing distractedly) You know--like \"Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds.\" \nLUCY eyes DUKE venomously. \nGONZO Lucy!  Lucy, be cool, goddamnit! Remember what happened at the airport!  No more of that, okay? \nLUCY keeps her eyes on DUKE.  GONZO idles over and puts his arm round her shoulder. \nGONZO Lucy... this is my client.  This is Mr. Duke, the famous journalist. He's paying for this suite, Lucy. He's on our side. \nDUKE flops onto the sofa. \nGONZO Mr. Duke is my friend.  He loves artists. \nDUKE notices for the first time that the room is full of artwork.  Maybe 40 or 50 portraits, some in oil, some in charcoal, all more or less the same size and same face. \nGONZO Lucy paints portraits of Barbra Streisand. \nLUCY I drew these from TV. \nGONZO Fantastic.  She came all the way down here from Montana just to give these portraits to Barbra.  We're going over to the Americana Hotel tonight to meet her backstage... \nDUKE's voice rises above GONZO. \nDUKE (V/O) I desperately needed peace, rest, sanctuary.  I hadn't counted on this.  Finding my attorney on acid and locked into some kind of preternatural courtship. \nDUKE Well, I guess they brought the car round by now.  LET'S GET THE STUFF OUT OF THE TRUNK. \nDUKE fixes GONZO hard. \nGONZO Absolutely, LET'S GET THE STUFF. (to LUCY) Now, we'll be right back.  Don't answer the phone if it rings. \nLUCY (makes one-fingered Jesus freak sign) God bless. \nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY \nDUKE collars GONZO -- serious. \nDUKE WELL?  What are your plans? \nGONZO Plans? \nDUKE Lucy. \nGONZO (struggling to focus) Shit.  I met her on the plane and I had all that acid. (he shrugs) You know, those little blue barrels. I gave her a cap before I realized... she's a religious freak... Jesus, she's never even had a drink. \nDUKE Well... It'll probably work out. We can keep her loaded and peddle her ass at the drug convention. \nGONZO stares uneasily at DUKE. \nGONZO Listen, she's running away from home for something like the fifth time in six months.  It's terrible. \nDUKE She's perfect for this gig.  These cops will go fifty bucks a head to beat her into submission and then gang fuck her.  We can set her up in one of these back street motels, hang pictures of Jesus all over the room, then turn these pigs loose on her... Hell she's strong; she'll hold her own. \nGONZO's face twitches badly. \nGONZO Jesus Christ.  I knew you were sick but I never expected to hear you actually say that kind of stuff. \nDUKE It's straight economics.  This girl is a god-send.  Shit, she can make us a grand a day. \nGONZO NO!  Stop talking like that. \nDUKE I figure she can do about four at a time.  Christ, if we keep her full of acid that's more like two grand a day.  Maybe three. \nGONZO You filthy bastard.  I should cave your fucking head in. \nDUKE In a few hours, she'll probably be sane enough to work herself into a towering Jesus-based rage at the hazy recollection of being seduced by some kind of cruel Samoan who fed her liquor and LSD, dragged her to a Vegas hotel room and savagely penetrated every orifice in her body with his throbbing, uncircumcised member. \nGONZO starts crying. \nEXECUTIVE DIRECTOR (crackling and booming over the lousy sound system) On behalf of the prosecuting attorneys of this county, I welcome you to the Third National DA's Conference on Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs. \nThe EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR -- well groomed, GOP businessman type -- speaks from the podium.  A banner behind him reads: NATIONAL DA'S CONVENTION 1971. \"If You Don't Know, Come To Learn... If You Know, Come To Teach.\" \nA BIG MIXED CROWD: TOP LEVEL STRAIGHT COPS, UNDERCOVER NARCS AND OTHER TWILIGHT TYPES -- beards, mustaches and super-Mod dress.  Just because you're a cop, doesn't mean you can't be WITH IT!  However, for every URBAN-HIPSTER there are around 20 REDNECKS. \nA dozen big, low-fidelity speakers mounted on steel poles distort and feed back the EXECUTIVE's voice through the room. \nAt the back, under a loudspeaker, sits DUKE -- $40 FBI wingtips, a Pat Boone madras sportcoat, and an official name tag: RAOUL DUKE, PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR, L.A. \nGONZO sits beside him.  His name tag: DR. GONZO.  EXPERT, CRIMINAL DRUG ANALYSIS.  He's nervous -- close to the edge. \nGONZO (lowers his voice) I saw these bastards in Easy Rider, but I didn't believe they were real. Not like this.  Not hundreds of them! \nDUKE They're actually nice people when you get to know them. \nGONZO Man, I know these people in my goddamn blood! \nDUKE Don't mention that word around here. You'll get them excited. \nGONZO This is a fucking nightmare. \nDUKE Right.  Sure as hell some dope- dealing bomb freak is going to recognize you and put the word out that you're partying with a thousand cops. \nCOP IN BACK SSSSHHH! \nDR. BLUMQUIST -- a \"drug expert\" -- takes the stage. \nDR. BLUMQUIST We must come to terms with the Drug Culture in the country... country... country... \nThe sound systems echoes. \nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D) The reefer butt is called a \"roach,\" because it resembles a cockroach... cockroach... cockroach... \nGONZO (whispers) What the fuck are these people talking about?  You'd have to be crazy on acid to think a joint looked like a goddamn cockroach! \nDUKE (V/O) It was clear that we had stumbled into a prehistoric gathering. \nDR. BLUMQUIST Now, there are four states of being in the cannabis, or marijuana, society: Cool, Groovy, Hip, and Square.  The square is seldom if ever cool.  He is not \"with it,\" that is, he doesn't know \"what's happening.\" But if he manages to figure it out, he moves up a notch to \"hip.\" \nDUKE and GONZO listen in disbelief. \nDR. BLUMQUIST (CONT'D) And if he can bring himself to approve of what is happening, he becomes \"groovy.\" After that, with much luck and perseverance, he can rise to the rank of \"cool.\" A cool guy... cool guy... cool guy... \nCOP IN BACK Dr. Bloomquist, do you think the anthropologist, Margaret Mead's strange behavior of late might possibly be explained by a private marijuana addiction? \nDR. BLUMQUIST I really don't know, but at her age, if she did smoke grass, she'd have one hell of a trip! \nRoars of laughter. \nGONZO I know a hell of a lot better ways to waste my time than listening to this bullshit. \nHe stands, knocking the ashtray off his chair arm, and plunges down the aisle to the door. \nCOP IN BACK Down in front! \nGONZO Fuck you!  I have to get out!  I don't belong here! \nCOP IN BACK Good riddance! \nHe stumbles from the room.  DUKE turns his attention back to the stage. \nThe lights go down.  A black & white film -- REEFER MADNESS! -- illustrates his now evangelical talk. \nFILM NARRATOR KNOW YOUR DOPE FIEND!  YOUR LIFE MAY DEPEND ON IT!  You will not be able to see his eyes because of Tea-Shades, but his knuckles will be white from inner tension... \nDUKE turns his attention to a 340 pound TEXAN POLICE CHIEF who necks with his 290 pound WIFE beside him. \nFILM NARRATOR ... and his pants will be crusted with semen from constantly jacking off when he can't find a rape victim... \nDUKE gazes at the TEXAN and his WIFE. -- Feigning sickness, he gets up, hand over mouth. \nDA Veterans?!!!? \nAgog with the horrors of the story, the BARTENDER polishes the glass -- faster and faster... \nGONZO Yeh.  The big guy used to be a major in the Marines. \nDA A major! \nGONZO We know where he lives, but we can't get near the house. \nDA Naw!  Not a major. \nGONZO He wanted the pineal gland. \nDA Really? \nGONZO That's how he got so big.  When he quit the Marines he was just a little guy. \nDUKE Usually, it's whole families. During the night.  Most of them don't even wake up until they feel their heads going -- and then, of course, it's too late. \nThe glass smashes in the BARTENDER's hand. \nDUKE (CONT'D) Happens every day. \nDUKE turns to a WAITRESS with a warm smile. \nDUKE (CONT'D) Three more rums.  Plenty of ice. Maybe a handful of lime chunks. \nWAITRESS Are you guys with the police convention upstairs? \nDA We sure are, Miss. \nWAITRESS I thought so.  I never heard that kind of talk around here before. Jesus Christ!  How do you guys stand that kind of work? \nGONZO (grinning) We like it.  It's groovy. \nThe WAITRESS stares -- sickened -- at GONZO. \nDUKE What's wrong with you?  Hell, somebody has to do it. \nGONZO Hurry up with those drinks.  We're thirsty.  Only two rums.  Make mine a Bloody Mary. \nDA (whacks his fist on the bar) Hell, I really hate to hear this. Because everything that happens in California seems to get down our way, sooner or later.  Mostly Atlanta.  But that was back when the goddamn bastards were peaceful. All we had to do was to keep 'em under surveillance.  They didn't roam around much... But now Jesus, it seems nobody's safe. \nGONZO (with a conspiratorial nod) You're going to need to take the bull by the horns -- go to the mat with this scum. \nDA What do you mean by that? \nGONZO You know what I mean.  We've done it before and we can damn well do it again! \nDUKE Cut their goddamn heads off.  Every one of them.  That's what we're doing in California. \nDA (stupefied) WHAT? \nGONZO Sure.  It's all on the Q.T., but everybody who matters is with us all the way down the line. \nDUKE We keep it quiet.  It's not the kind of thing you'd want to talk about upstairs.  Not with the press around. \nDA (recovering slightly) Hell, no.  We'd never hear the goddamn end of it. \nDUKE Dobermans don't talk. \nDA What? \nGONZO Sometimes it's easier to just rip out the backstraps. \nDUKE They'll fight like hell if you try to take the head without the dogs. \nDA God almighty! (muttering in a daze) I don't think I should tell my wife about this.  She'd never understand. You know how women are. \nDUKE gives the DA a brotherly slap on the back. \nGONZO She really flipped over you.  The only way I could get rid of her was by saying you were taking me out to the desert for a showdown -- that you wanted me out of the way so you could have her all to yourself. (laughing again) I guess she figures you won.  That phone message wasn't for me, was it? \nA look of stunned realization from DUKE... \nINT. FANTASY COURT ROOM - DAY \nLUCY is on the witness stand. \nLUCY Yessir, those two men in the dock are the ones who gave me the LSD and took me to the hotel. \nA doomed DUKE and GONZO await their fate. \nLUCY I don't know for sure what they done to me, but I remember it was horrible. \nJUDGE Twenty years... and Double Castration! \nThe JUDGE bangs his gavel. \nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - DAY \nDUKE is madly stuffing his suitcase. \nGONZO Wait!  You can't leave me alone in this snake pit.  This room is in my name. \nDUKE KEEPS PACKING.  GONZO is looking worried. \nGONZO OK, goddamnit!... Look... I'll call her.  I'll get her off our backs. You're right.  She's my problem. \nDUKE It's gone too far. \nGONZO Relax.  Let me handle this. (dials the PHONE, snaps angrily at DUKE) You'd make a piss-poor lawyer. ...Room 1600, please. (to DUKE) As your attorney, I advise you not to worry. (nods towards bathroom) Take a hit out of that little brown bottle in my shaving kit. \nDUKE goes in the bathroom.  He finds a little bottle -- a label: \"DRINK ME.\" \nDUKE What is this? \nGONZO You won't need much.  Just a little tiny taste, that stuff makes pure mescaline seem like ginger-beer. Adrenochrome. \nDUKE stares wonderingly at the bottle. \nDUKE Adrenochrome... \nGONZO (into PHONE) Hi, Lucy?  Yeah, it's me.  I got your message...what?  Hell, no, I taught the bastard a lesson he'll never forget... what?  No, not dead, but he won't be bothering anybody for a while.  Yeah.  I left him out there, I stomped him, then pulled all his teeth out... \nDUKE (V/O) I remember thinking, \"Jesus, what a terrible thing to lay on somebody with a head full of acid.\" \nDUKE dips a match head into the brown bottle -- studies it -- TASTES IT -- NOTHING -- TASTES SOME MORE... \nGONZO (to PHONE) But here's the problem.  That bastard cashed a bad check downstairs and gave you as a reference.  They'll be looking for both of you.  Yeah, I know, but you can't judge a book by its cover, Lucy.  Some people are just basically rotten... Anyway, the last thing you want to do is call this hotel again; they'll trace the call and put you straight behind bars... no, I'm moving to the Tropicana right away.  I have to go, they've got the phone tapped. Yeah, I know, it was horrible, but it's all over now... OH MY GOD! THEY'RE KICKING THE DOOR DOWN! (throws the PHONE down; shouts) No!  Get away from me!  I'm innocent! It was Duke!  I swear to God! (MORE) \nGONZO (CONT'D) (stomps the PHONE; moans) No, I don't know where she is. You'll never catch Lucy!  She's gone!  I swear, I don't know where she is!  DON'T PUT THAT THING ON ME! (slams the PHONE down) \nGONZO sits back in his chair... watching MISSION IMPOSSIBLE. \nGONZO Well.  That's that.  She's probably stuffing herself down the incinerator about now.  That's the last we should be hearing from Lucy. (fumbling with the hash pipe) Where's the opium? \nDUKE stares at the back of GONZO's neck.  SOMETHING VERY STRANGE IS HAPPENING TO HIM... \nDUKE (V/O) I remember slumping on the bed, his performance had given me a bad jolt. For a moment I thought his mind had snapped -- that he actually believed he was being attacked by invisible enemies.  But the room was quiet again. \nDUKE CLUTCHES THE BROWN BOTTLE. \nDUKE Where'd you get this? \nGONZO Never mind, it's absolutely pure. \nDUKE Jesus... what kind of monster client have you picked up this time? There's only one source for this stuff -- the adrenaline gland from a living human body! \nGONZO turns to smile at DUKE. \nGONZO I know, but the guy didn't have any cash to pay me.  He's one of these Satanism freaks.  He offered me human blood -- said it would take me higher than I've ever been in my life. (laughs -- struts round DUKE -- eyes bright with expectation) I thought he was kidding, so I told him I'd just as soon have an ounce or so of pure adrenochrome -- or maybe just a fresh adrenaline gland to chew on. \nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nDarkness.  Insanely, somewhere NILSSON plays -- \"Put the lime in the coconut and mix em all up...\" \nDUKE (V/O) What kind of rat-bastard psychotic would play that song -- right now, at this moment? \nDUKE opens his eyes and the hotel suite rushes in.  He lies, awkwardly twisted -- unable to move.  He could have been there days -- months. \nDUKE (V/O) When I came to the general back alley ambiance of the suite was so rotten, so incredibly foul.  How long had I been lying there?  Hours? Days?  Months?  All these signs of violence.  What had happened? \nDUKE moves his eyes -- taking in his surroundings: Like THE SIGHT OF SOME DISASTROUS ZOOLOGICAL EXPERIMENT involving whisky and gorillas.  Blue and red Christmas tree lights replace lightbulbs, used towels hanging everywhere, pornographic pictures ripped out of a magazine are plastered on a shattered mirror. \nDUKE (V/O) There was evidence in this room of excessive consumption of almost every type of drug known to civilized man since 1544 AD. \nDUKE manages to move -- stiffly gets to his bare feet -- HOBBLES ROUND THE TRASHED ROOM like a newly risen ape. \nDUKE (V/O) But what kind of addict would need all these coconut husks and crushed honeydew rinds?  Would the presence of junkies account for all these uneaten french fries?  These puddles of glazed ketchup on the bureau?  Maybe so, but then why all this booze?  And these crude pornographic photos smeared with mustard that had dried to a hard yellow crust... \nDUKE peers into Gonzo's room -- HIS BED LIKE A BURNED OUT RAT'S NEST -- blackened springs and wires. \nDUKE (V/O) These were not the hoof prints of your normal god-fearing junkie.  It was too savage, too aggressive. \nQUICK FLASHBACK: \nGONZO SMASHES THE TEN FOOT MIRROR WITH A HAMMER: \nBACK IN THE ROOM: \nDUKE stares at the smashed mirror. \nDUKE (V/O) Grim memories and bad flashbacks. \nIn the bathroom, DUKE'S unlaced boots CRUSH BROKEN GLASS IN VOMIT AND GRAPEFRUIT RINDS. \nDUKE unzips and pisses.  THERE IN THE TOILET BOWL IS THE MAGNUM .357! \nDUKE (V/O) Something ugly had happened.  I was sure of it... \nDUKE stares at the golden stream SPLASHING ON THE GUN. \nThe SOUNDS OF VOMITING come from a closet near the front door. \nDUKE looks into the room.  He sees GONZO's ass sticking out of the closet.  He opens his mouth to speak when, IN THE SMASHED MIRROR HE SEES THE FRAGMENTED REFLECTION OF HIMSELF... sleeping on the sofa. \nThe ominous SOUND OF A KEY TURNING in the room lock. \nA hellish scream wakes up the SLEEPING DUKE.  He sees GONZO grappling naked with the maid -- gun to her head.  GONZO is muffling her screams with an ice bag. \nMAID Please... please... I'm only the maid.  I didn't mean nothin!... \nDUKE (jumps up from the bed, flashing his press badge) YOU'RE UNDER ARREST! \nGONZO (to DUKE) She must have used a pass key.  I was polishing my shoes in the closet when I noticed her sneaking in-so I took her. \nDUKE shakes his head. \nDUKE (barks at the MAID) What made you do it?  Who paid you off? \nMAID Nobody.  I'm the maid! \nGONZO You're lying!  You were after the evidence.  Who put you up to this -- the manager? \nMAID I don't know what you're talking about! \nGONZO Bullshit!  You're just as much a part of it as they are! \nMAID Part of what? \nDUKE The dope ring.  You must know what's going on in this hotel.  Why do you think we're here? \nMAID (blubbering) I know you're cops, but I thought you were just here for that convention.  I swear!  All I wanted to do was clean up the room.  I don't know anything about dope! \nThe trolley collides into the WHITE WHALE.  SHOPPERS gather at the supermarket entrance to watch -- baskets loaded with junk, SCREAMING KIDS and EMPTY WALLETS. \nDUKE switches on the music: JUMPING JACK FLASH.  He selects a coconut -- ceremonially balances it on the hood.  GONZO pulls out a silver claw-hammer.  A sly look at the gathering CROWD... then he smashes the hammer down on the coconut! \nA GASP from the surly SHOPPERS. \nDUKE places another coconut.  SMASH!  Milk and white meat flies everywhere. \nSHOPPER #1 Hey!  Is that your car? \nDUKE Sure is. \nSMASH!  Coconut fragments fly. \nDUKE Any of you folks want the milk? We're after the meat.  This is honest coconut essence.  Real meat. \nSMASH! \nSHOPPER #2 Meat, hell!  Look what you're doing to that car! \nGONZO Fuck the car.  They should make these things with a goddamn FM radio. \nSMASH! \nDUKE Yeh... This foreign made crap -- is sucking our dollar balance dry! \nSHOPPER #3 Someone should stop them! \nSMASH! \nDUKE You poor fools don't understand, do you?  This car is the property of the World Bank!  That money goes to ITALY! \nSHOPPER #3 Somebody should call the police! \nGONZO Police?  Are you people crazy? \nGONZO confronts the CROWD, hammer in one hand, a coconut in the other. \nGONZO (CONT'D) You folks every heard of ole Patrick Henry?  Know what he said?! \nSilence -- the CROWD uncomprehending of this STONE DEGENERATE. \nGONZO (CONT'D) (ROARS) GIVE ME LIBERTY OR GIVE ME DEATH! \nGONZO brings the hammer down on the hood.  CLANG! \nA gasp from the CROWD.  Getting ugly. \nGONZO (CONT'D) In Samoa we LOVE THE CONSTITUTION! \nSHOPPER #3 Bullshit. \nThe CROWD move in. \nSHOPPER #1 Call the goddamn police! \nGONZO SWINGS THE HAMMER.  CLANG! \nSHOPPER #4 Look what they've done to that beautiful car! \nDUKE jumps in behind the wheel. \nDUKE This crowd is not rational.  They can't relate to us.  Let's go! \nA final CLANG!  GONZO jumps in. \nDUKE floors the accelerator -- screams at the CROWD. \nDUKE You people voted for Hubert Humphrey! You killed Jesus! \nThey swerve round and through the CROWD. \nIn the Ford: TWO COUPLES -- MIDDLE-AGED AMERICAN FACES FROZEN IN SHOCK -- stare straight ahead.  GONZO leans out -- close to them. \nGONZO Hey, honkies!  Goddamnit, I'm serious.  I want to sell you some pure fucking smack! \nNo reaction. \nGONZO Cheap heroin!  This is the real stuff!  You won't get hooked.  I just got back from Vietnam!  This is scag, folks.  Pure scag! \nThe lights change.  The Ford bolts.  DUKE keeps pace with them. \nGONZO Shoot!  Fuck!  Scag!  Blood! Heroin!  Rape!  Cheap!  Communist! Jab it right in your fucking eyeballs! \nThe MAN IN THE BACK SEAT suddenly loses control -- enraged, lunges against the glass, trying to get at GONZO. \nMAN IN CAR You dirty bastards!  Pull over and I'll kill you!  God damn you!  You bastards! \nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nBACK IN THE SUITE: \nThe tapes runs: \nMAN IN CAR ON TAPE You dirty bastards! \nAn ugly squeal of brakes. \nGONZO ON TAPE Shit, he was trying to bite me!  I shoulda maced the fucker! \nDUKE fast forwards the tape.  The TAPE MANGLES -- the sounds ski to a halt... \nDUKE grabs the nearest tool -- uses it to hook out the tape, then realizes... IT'S GONZO'S RAZOR-SHARP FOLDING KNIFE... A CHILLING MOMENT... \nDUKE turns the knife over... THERE'S A DRIED CRIMSON SPOT ON THE BLADE... OR IS IT DRIED MASHED POTATOES? \nREAD ON TO FIND OUT! \nDUKE (remembering) Back door beauty! \nDUKE (V/O) The mentality of Las Vegas is so grossly atavistic that a really massive crime often slips by unrecognized. \nDUKE SCRAPS A LITTLE OF THE CRUST -- TASTES IT... \nDUKE (V/O CONT'D) The possibility of physical and mental collapse is very real... No sympathy for the devil; keep that in mind.  Buy the ticket, take the ride... \nHE HEARS THE SOUNDS OF SOMEONE BEHIND BEATEN UP... \nVOICE OFF Shit!  Faggot!  Bastard! \nEXT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nWHACK!  SHADOWY FIGURES beat up a MAN -- give him A GOOD KICKING.  BRUTAL AND UGLY. \nDUKE (V/O) North Vegas is where you go when you've fucked up once too often on The Strip and when you're not even welcome in the cut-rate Downtown places. \nPAN to reveal a seedy diner -- THE NORTH STAR CAFE in the background.  Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the counter. \nINT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nDUKE (V/O) The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just a place to rest and regroup.  I wasn't even hungry. \nGONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE BEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper. \nDUKE (V/O) There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard... \nGONZO (to WAITRESS) Two glasses of ice water with ice. \nThe WAITRESS brings the ice water. \nDUKE (V/O) She looked like a burnt out caricature of Jane Russell.  She was definitely in charge here... \nGONZO gulps down his glass of water and hands her a napkin. \nGONZO What are you doing?  You were supposed to turn back there! \nDUKE (V/O) We had abused every rule that Vegas lived by -- burning the locals, abusing the tourists, terrifying the help.  The only chance now, I felt, was the possibility that we'd gone to such excess that nobody in the position to bring the hammer down on us could possibility believe it. \nDUKE suddenly SLAMS ON THE BRAKES. \nGONZO Jesus Christ!!! \nThere, crossing the road in front of them, is LUCY -- her paintings under her arm -- looking lost.  SHE LOOKS UP WITH A VAGUE SENSE OF RECOGNITION... \nDUKE throws the car into a SKIDDING REVERSE TURN AND ROARS OFF. \nEXT. DESERT ROAD OUTSIDE LAS VEGAS - DAY \nTHE WHITE WHALE TEARS DOWN THE DESERTED FREEWAY.  GONZO looks wildly around. \nGONZO Goddamnit!  We're lost!  What are we doing out here on this godforsaken road? \nGONZO sees that THEY'RE RUNNING PARALLEL WITH THE AIRPORT RUNWAY. \nGONZO The airport is over there! \nDUKE Never missed a plane yet. \nDUKE HITS THE BRAKES and wrenches the wheel -- takes the WHALE down into the grassy freeway divider.  WHEELS CHURNING, HE MAKES IT UP THE OPPOSITE BANK, nose of the car straight up, then BOUNCES ONTO THE FREEWAY and keeps going right OVER A FENCE, dragging it through a cactus field and onto the RUNWAY. \nGONZO is FROZEN WITH FEAR -- GRIPPING THE DASHBOARD.  He throws a worried look at DUKE. \nDUKE I'll drop you right next to the plane. \nThey SPEED UNDER A PARKED AIRPLANE, SHOUTING ABOVE THE JET ENGINE SCREAM. \nGONZO No!  I can't get out!  They'll crucify me.  I'll have to take the blame! \nDUKE (irritatedly) Ridiculous!  Just say you were hitchhiking to the airport and I picked you up.  You never saw me before.  Shit, this town is full of white Cadillac convertibles.  I plan to go through there so fast that nobody will even glimpse the goddamn license plate.  You ready? \nGONZO Why not?  But for Christ's sake, just do it fast! \nEXT. AT THE AIRPLANE - DAY \nDUKE SCREECHES UP in front of the DESERT AIR 727.  GONZO JUMPS OUT -- HEADS FOR THE PLANE. \nDUKE watches him go -- RELENTS. \nDUKE Hey! \nGONZO stops -- turns. \nDUKE Don't take any guff from those swine.  Remember, if you have any trouble you can always send a telegram to the Right People. \nGONZO Yeah... Explaining my Position. Some asshole wrote a poem about that once... \nGONZO pauses. \nGONZO Probably good advice, if you have shit for brains. \nGONZO turns and RACES TOWARDS THE STEPS JUST AS HE IS ABOUT TO ENTER THE PLANE HE PAUSES AND LOOKS BACK...SMILES...AND LEANS FORWARD AND VOMITS. \nDUKE (V/O) There he goes -- one of God's own prototypes -- a high powered mutant of some kind never even considered for mass production.  Too weird to live and too rare to die. \nDUKE watches for a second then ROARS AWAY.  PULL BACK WITH THE WHITE SHARK -- LEAVING THE AIRPLANE FAR BEHIND. \nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL SUITE/APOCALYPSE - NIGHT \nOn the TV an airplane soars thru the sky.  Pull back to find DUKE barricaded in GONZO'S BEDROOM.  He is typing on his typewriter. \nDUKE We are all wired into a survival trip now.  No more of the speed that fueled that 60's.  That was the fatal flaw in Tim Leary's trip. He crashed around America selling \"consciousness expansion\" without ever giving a thought to the grim meat-hook realities that were lying in wait for all the people who took him seriously... \nDUKE records like A WAR CORRESPONDENT.  The CAMERA slowly rises -- DUKE alone in the room with the TV SPEWING OUT IMAGES OF WARS AND CIVIL UNREST OF THE 90'S. \nDUKE All those pathetically eager acid freaks who thought they could buy Peace and Understanding for three bucks a hit.  But their loss and failure is ours too.  What Leary took down with him was the central illusion of a whole life-style that he helped create... \n", "test1_input": "He walks to the bathroom and opens the door. \nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE BATHROOM - NIGHT \nSubmerged in green water, GONZO WALLOWS in the steaming tub. Soap labels and grapefruit rinds float on the surface.  A large empty pack of Neutrogena soap lies on the floor.  The shower is on -- the tub overflowing.  THE TAPE RECORDER PLAYS, from where it's plugged into the razor socket over the sink. \nDUKE turns off the shower -- notices a HUGE HUNK OF CHEWED UP WHITE BLOTTER. \nDUKE You ate ALL THIS ACID? \nNo answer. \nDUKE (turning down the volume) You evil son of a bitch.  You better hope there's some Thorazine in that bag, because if there's not, you're in bad trouble. \nGONZO Music!  Turn it up.  Put that tape on. \nDUKE What tape? \nGONZO Jefferson Airplane. \"White Rabbit.\" I want a rising sound. \nDUKE You're doomed.  I'm leaving here in two hours and then they're going to come up here and beat the mortal shit out of you with big saps. Right there in that tub. \nGONZO I dig my own graves.  Green water and the White Rabbit.  Put it on. \nDUKE OK.  But do me one last favor, will you.  Can you give me two hours? That's all I ask -- just two hours to sleep before tomorrow.  I suspect it's going to be a very difficult day. \nHe switches on the tape. \"WHITE RABBIT\" begins to build. \nGONZO (coolly) Of course, I'm your attorney, I'll give you all the time you need, at my normal rates: $45 an hour -- but you'll be wanting a cushion, so, why don't you just lay one of those $100 bills down there beside the radio, and fuck off? \nDUKE How about a check? \nGONZO Whatever's right. \nDUKE moves the radio as far from the tub as he can and leaves, closing the door behind him. \nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nDUKE goes across to the sofa and crashes -- exhausted. Suddenly a great ripping and crashing noise in the bathroom. \nGONZO (V/O) Help!  You bastard!  I need help! \nDUKE JUMPS up -- crosses to the bathroom door, muttering. \nDUKE Shit, he's killing himself! \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nDUKE RUSHES IN.  GONZO flails -- trying to reach the radio with the shower curtain pole which he has ripped from its mounts. \nGONZO (snarling) I want that fucking radio! \nDUKE GRABS THE RADIO. \nDUKE Don't touch it!  Get back in that tub! \nGONZO Back the tape up.  I need it again! Let it roll!  Just as high as the fucker can go!  And when it comes to that fantastic note where the rabbit bites its own head off, I want you to THROW THAT FUCKING RADIO INTO THE TUB WITH ME! \nDUKE stares down at GONZO. \nDUKE Not me.  It would blast you through the wall -- stone dead in ten seconds and they'd make me explain it! \nGONZO BULLSHIT!  Don't make me use this. \nHIS ARM LASHES OUT OF THE WATER, HOLDING THE KNIFE. \nDUKE Jesus. \nGONZO Do it!  I want to get HIGHER! \nDUKE considers this.  He's had enough. \n", "test1_true": "GONZO falls back into the water, smiling gratefully. \nGONZO Fuck yes.  I was beginning to think I was going to have to go out and get one of the goddamn maids to do it. \nDUKE Are you ready? \nHe switches \"WHITE RABBIT\" back on.  GONZO HOWLS AND MOANS AND THRASHES TO THE MUSIC, straining to get over the top. \nMeanwhile, DUKE picks up a grapefruit from the sink -- a good two-pounder, he gets a grip on it... and when \"WHITE RABBIT\" peaks... HE HURLS IT INTO THE TUB LIKE A CANNONBALL. \nGONZO SCREAMS CRAZILY, THRASHING AND CHURNING -- CAUSING A TIDAL WAVE. \nDUKE JERKS THE RADIO CABLE OUT OF THE SOCKET -- SLAMS OUT OF THE BATHROOM. \nINT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT \nDUKE slumps onto the sofa. \nSILENCE. \nGONZO RIPS OPEN THE BATHROOM DOOR, his eyes unfocused.  HE WAVES THE RAZOR SHARP BLADE out in front of him -- LUNGES at DUKE.  DUKE WHIPS OUT A CAN OF MACE. \nDUKE MACE!  YOU WANT THIS? \nGONZO stops -- hisses. \nGONZO You bastard!  You'd do that, wouldn't you? \nDUKE (laughs) Why worry?  You'll like it.  Nothing in the world like a Mace high. Forty-five minutes on your knees with the dry heaves... \nGONZO You cheap honky sonofabitch... \nDUKE Why not?  Hell, just a minute ago, you were asking me to kill you! And now you want to kill me!  What I should do, goddamnit, is call the police! \nGONZO The cops? \nDUKE There's no choice.  I wouldn't dare go to sleep with you wandering around with a head full of acid and wanting to slice me up with that goddamn knife! \nGONZO (mumbles) Who said anything about slicing you up?  I just wanted to carve a little Z on your forehead.  Nothing serious. \nGONZO shrugs and reaches for a cigarette on top of the TV set. \nDUKE (menaces him with the MACE) Get back in that tub.  Eat some reds and try to calm down.  Smoke some grass, shoot some smack -- shit, do whatever you have to do, but let me get some rest. \nGONZO turns toward the bathroom -- suddenly sad. \nGONZO Hell, yes.  You really need some sleep.  You have to work.  Goddamn. What a bummer.  Try to rest.  Don't let me keep you up. \nGONZO shuffles back into the bathroom.  DUKE wedges a chair up against the bathroom doorknob and puts the mace can next to the clock. \nDUKE turns on the TV.  WHITE NOISE FILLS THE ROOM.  He collapses onto the sofa and lights up his lightbulb as pipe. \nDUKE (V/O) Ignore the nightmare in the bathroom. Just another ugly refugee from the Love Generation. \nThe WHITE NOISE snow storm on the TV is reflected in his face.  The camera pulls back revealing THE ENTIRE WALL BEHIND HIM TO BE SWIRLING WITH THE FIZZING SNOWSTORM PATTERN. \nDUKE (V/O) My attorney had never been able to accept the notion -- often espoused by former drug abusers -- that you can get a lot higher without drugs than with them.  And neither have I, for that matter. \nThe pattern on the wall changes to A 60'S VISCOUS OIL LIGHTSHOW PATTERN.  With DUKE still sitting in the foreground, the projected image widens to reveal the interior of A HAIGHT ASHBURY DANCE HALL full of DANCING PROTO-HIPPIES. \nINT. MATRIX CLUB - NIGHT \nA slightly YOUNGER DUKE moves through the throng.  All the action is in a DREAMLIKE SLOW-MOTION. \nDUKE (V/O) I recall one night in the Matrix. There I was -- a victim of the Drug Explosion.  A natural street freak, just eating whatever came by. \nA ROAD-PERSON with a big pack on his back is shouting.  The sound of his voice, like his movements, is in slow-motion. \nROAD-PERSON Anybody want some L...S...D...?  I got all the makin's right here. All I need is a place to cook. \nThe camera pushes right into the ROAD-PERSON's mouth. \n", "test1_id": 1296, "test2_input": "CLERK What confused us was Dr. Gonzo's signature on the telegram from Los Angeles.  When we knew he was right here in the hotel. \nDUKE You did the right thing.  Never try to understand a press message. About half the time we use codes -- especially with Dr. Gonzo. \nCLERK Tell me.  When will the doctor be awake? \nDUKE (tenses) Awake?  What do you mean? \nDUKE's eyes are on the SECURITY GUARDS -- moving closer. \nCLERK (uncomfortably) Well... the manager, Mr. Heem, would like to meet him.  Nothing unusual.  Mr. Heem likes to meet all our large accounts... put them on a personal basis... just a chat and a handshake, you understand. \nDUKE Of course.  But if I were you, I'd leave the Doctor alone until after he's eaten breakfast.  He's a very crude man. \nDUKE edges the car forward, but is stopped by the CLERK. \nCLERK But he will be available?  Perhaps later this morning? \nDUKE Look.  That telegram was all scrambled.  It was actually from Thompson, not to him.  Western Union must have gotten the names reversed.  I have to get going.  I have to get out to the track. \nCLERK There's no hurry!  The race is over! \nDUKE (taking off) Not for me. \nHe waves the CLERK off the car -- roars away. \nCLERK Let's have lunch! \nDUKE Righto! \nEXT. ROAD OUT OF VEGAS - DAY \nDUKE drives the RED SHARK out of Vegas. \nA \"YOU ARE LEAVING LAS VEGAS\" sign flashes past. \nBob Dylan plays: \"Memphis Blues Again -- \"Aaww, Mama, can this really by the end...?\" \nA sign: LOS ANGELES -- 400 miles. \nDUKE (V/O) Jesus, bad waves of paranoia, madness, fear and loathing -- intolerable vibrations in this place.  Get out!  The weasels were closing in.  I could smell the ugly brutes.  Flee! \nDUKE drives fast. \nDUKE Do me one last favor Lord: just give me five more high-speed hours before you bring the hammer down; just let me get rid of this goddamn car and off of this horrible desert. \nA sign flashes \"YOU CAN RUN BUT YOU CAN'T HIDE.\" \nA patrol car pulls out behind him, lights flashing. \nDUKE (CONT'D) You evil bastard!  This is your work!  You'd better take care of me, Lord... because if you don't you're going to have me on your hands. \nThe patrol car screams after the RED SHARK. \nDUKE (V/O) Few people understand the psychology of dealing with a Highway Traffic Cop.  Your normal speeder will panic and immediately pull over to the side.  This is wrong. \nDUKE floors the gas pedal. \nDUKE (V/O) It arouses contempt in the cop heart. \nTHE SPEEDOMETER CLIMBS STEADILY. \nDUKE (V/O) Make the bastard chase you.  He will follow.  But he won't know what to make of your blinker signal that says you're about to turn right. \nDUKE signals right.  The RED SHARK screams at 120 mph. \nDUKE (V/O) This is to let him know you're looking for a proper place to pull off and talk. \nAN EXIT OFF RAMP: MAX SPEED 25. \nDUKE hits the brakes.  The COP brakes. \n", "test2_true": "The patrol car spins and fishtails crazily out of control. \nEXT. SCENIC PICNIC AREA - DAY \nThe patrol car comes skidding around the corner.  DUKE stands beside the RED SHARK, completely relaxed and smiling. \nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN gets out of the car, screaming. \nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN Just what the FUCK did you think you were doing?! \nDUKE smiles. \nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN May I see your license. \nDUKE Of course, officer. \nDUKE reaches for it.  And BOTH MEN look down at a beer can -- which DUKE had, somehow, forgotten was in his hand. \nDUKE (V/O) I knew I was fucked. \nThe COP relaxes -- actually smiles... He reaches out for DUKE's wallet, then holds out his other hand for the beer. \nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN Could I have that, please? \nDUKE Why not?  It was getting warm anyway. \nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN takes it, pours out the beer -- glances in the back seat of the RED SHARK.  Amongst the bars of soap... A case of warm beer.  DUKE smiles back at him. \nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN You realize... \nDUKE Yeah.  I know.  I'm guilty.  I understand that.  I knew it was a crime but I did it anyway.  Shit, why argue?  I'm a fucking criminal. \nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN That's a strange attitude. \nHe looks at DUKE thoughtfully. \nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN You know -- I get the feeling you could use a nap.  There's a rest area up ahead.  Why don't you pull over and sleep a few hours? \nDUKE A nap won't help.  I've been awake for too long -- three or four nights.  I can't even remember.  If I go to sleep now, I'm dead for twenty hours. \nThe HIGHWAY PATROLMAN smiles. \nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN Okay.  Here's how it is.  What goes into my book, as of noon, is that I apprehended you... for driving too fast, and advised you to proceed no further than the next rest area... your stated destination, right? Where you plan to take a long nap. Do I make myself clear? \nDUKE How far is Baker?  I was hoping to stop there for lunch. \nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN Not my jurisdiction.  The city limits are two point two miles beyond the rest area.  Can you make it that far? \nDUKE I'll try.  I've been wanting to go to Baker for a long time.  I've heard a lot about it. \nThe PATROLMAN holds the door for DUKE who gets in. \nHIGHWAY PATROLMAN Excellent seafood.  With a mind like yours, you'll probably want to try the land-crab.  Try the Majestic Diner. \nThe PATROLMAN slams the door shut. \nEXT. DESERT ROAD - DAY \nDUKE drives away -- teeth gritted. \nDUKE (V/O) I felt raped.  The Pig had done me on all fronts, and now he was going off to chuckle about it -- on the west side of town, waiting for me to make a run for L.A. \nDUKE drives past the rest area to an intersection where he signals to turn right into Baker.  As he approaches the turn he sees the HITCHHIKER!  As DUKE slows to make the turn their eyes meet.  DUKE is about to wave -- but the HITCHHIKER drops his thumb. \nDUKE Great Jesus, it's him. \nDUKE, spooked, SPINS THE RED SHARK round -- ROARS BACK THE WAY HE CAME. \nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY \nDUKE on the public phone booth -- screaming. \n", "test2_id": 1297, "test3_input": "DUKE They've nailed me!  I'm trapped in some stinking desert crossroads called Baker.  I don't have much time.  The fuckers are closing in. They'll hunt me down like a beast! \nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY \nGONZO sits surrounded by legal papers and law books.  Mexican Day of the Dead masks hang from the walls -- flame-red demons. \nGONZO Who?  You sound a little paranoid. \nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY \nDUKE screams -- sweat pouring. \nDUKE You bastard!  I need a lawyer immediately! \nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY \nGONZO What are you doing in Baker? Didn't you get my telegram? \nEXT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY \nDUKE What?  Fuck telegrams.  I'm in trouble.  You worthless bastard. I'll cripple your ass for this! All that shit in the car is yours! You understand that?  When I finish testifying out here you'll be disbarred! \nINT. GONZO'S OFFICE - DAY \nGONZO You're supposed to be in Vegas.  We have a suite at the Flamingo.  I was just about to leave for the airport. \nINT. BAKER TRUCK STOP - DAY \nDUKE pulls out the telegram from his top pocket. \nGONZO'S VOICE You brainless scumbag!  You're supposed to be covering the National District Attorney's conference!  I made all the reservations... rented a white Cadillac convertible... the whole thing is arranged!  What the hell are you doing out there in the middle of the fucking desert? \nDUKE stares at the telegram. \nDUKE Never mind.  It's all a big joke. I'm actually sitting beside the pool at the Flamingo.  I'm talking from a portable phone.  Some dwarf brought it out from the casino.  I have total credit!  Can you grasp that? (shouts) Don't come anywhere near this place! Foreigners aren't welcome here! \nDUKE, breathing heavily, hangs up phone. \nEXT. DESERT - DAY \nC/U of .357 Magnum cylinder being spun. \nDUKE (V/O) Well.  This is how the world works. \nC/U An IGUANA basks in the sun. \nDUKE (V/O) All energy flows according to the whims of the Great Magnet. \nC/U Barrel of the gun.  It fires.  An explosion of desert dirt. \nDUKE (V/O) What a fool I was to defy Him. \nThe IGUANA sits unfazed. \nDUKE (V/O) Never cross the Great Magnet.  I understood this now... (another blast from the gun) ... and with understanding came a sense of almost terminal relief. \nDUKE stands alone in the vast desert firing at nothing, the thuds of the explosions echo away. \nEXT. ROAD INTO VEGAS - DAY \nThe RED SHARK driving back towards Las Vegas. \nDUKE (V/O) I had to get rid of The Shark.  Too many people might recognize it... ...especially the Vegas Police. (tight C/U of DUKE) Luckily, my credit card was still technically valid. \nPULL BACK TO REVEAL: \nDUKE, now driving a white Cadillac Coupe de Ville -- THE WHITE WHALE. \nDUKE pushes buttons -- lowers the top. \nDUKE (V/O) This was a superior machine -- ten grand worth of gimmicks and high price special effects.  The rear windows leapt up with a touch like frogs in a dynamited pond.  The dashboard was full of esoteric lights and dials and meters that I would never understand. \n", "test3_true": "A GIANT SIGN: THE FLAMINGO WELCOMES THE NATIONAL DA'S CONFERENCE ON NARCOTICS & DANGEROUS DRUGS. \nDUKE (V/O) If the Pigs were gathering in Vegas, I felt the Drug Culture should be represented as well... and there was a certain bent appeal in the notion of running a savage burn on one Las Vegas hotel and then just wheeling across town and checking into another. \nThe WHITE WHALE turns into a VIP parking slot, immediately attended by impressed MINIONS. \nDUKE (V/O) Me and a thousand ranking cops from all over America.  Why not?  Move confidently into their midst. \nINT. FLAMINGO HOTEL LOBBY - AFTERNOON \nDUKE enters -- old Levis, grubby sneakers, 10 peso Acapulco shirt coming apart at the seams, 3 day growth, eyes hidden behind mirror shades.  He heads for the check-in line. \nDUKE (V/O) My arrival was badly timed. \nTHE PLACE IS FULL OF COPS.  200 of them, on vacation, all dressed in cut price Vegas casuals: plaid Bermuda shorts, Arnie Palmer golf shirts, and rubberized beach sandals. \nAhead of DUKE -- A POLICE CHIEF argues with the DESK CLERK. The POLICE CHIEF'S AGNEW STYLE WIFE stands to the side, weeping.  The POLICE CHIEF'S FRIENDS stand uneasily around. \nPOLICE CHIEF What do you mean I'm too late to register?  I'm a police chief. From Michigan.  Look, fella, I told you. (waves a POSTCARD) I have a postcard here that says I have reservations in this hotel. \nCLERK (prissily) I'm sorry, sir.  You're on the \"late list.\" Your reservations were transferred to the... ah... Moonlight Motel, which is out on Paradise Boulevard... \nPOLICE CHIEF I've already paid for my goddamn room! \nCLERK It's actually a very fine place of lodging and only sixteen blocks from here, with its own pool and... \nPOLICE CHIEF You dirty little faggot!  Call the manager!  I'm tired of listening to this dogshit! \nFRIENDS restrain the POLICE CHIEF. \nCLERK (solicitously) I'm so sorry, sir.  May I call you a cab? \nThe POLICE CHIEF's screamed insults fade away... \nDUKE (V/O) Of course, I could hear what the Clerk was really saying... \nCLERK (IN DUKE'S IMAGINATION) Listen, you fuzzy little shithead -- I've been fucked around, in my time, by a fairly good cross- section of mean-tempered rule-crazy cops and now it's MY turn. \"Fuck you, officer, I'm in charge here, and I'm telling you we don't have room for you.\" \nDUKE steps to the desk, around the raging POLICE CHIEF. \nDUKE Say.  I hate to interrupt, but I wonder if maybe I could just sort of slide through and get out of your way.  Name's Raoul Duke -- Raoul Duke.  My attorney made the reservation. \nDUKE snaps a credit card down onto the counter.  EVERYONE goes silent.  The POLICE CHIEF GROUP stares at him like he was some kid of water rat crawling up to the desk.  The CLERK hits the bell for the BELLBOY. \nCLERK Certainly, Mr. Duke! \nDUKE My bags are out there in that white Cadillac convertible.  Can you have someone drive it around to the room? \nALL EYES turn to the gleaming WHITE WHALE. \nDUKE Oh, and could I get a quart of Wild Turkey, two fifths of Baccardi, and a night's worth of ice delivered to my room, please? \nCLERK Don't worry about a thing, sir. Just enjoy your stay. \nDUKE Well, thank you. \nDUKE gives the POLICE CHIEF a polite smile -- crosses to the elevator -- turns to face the GAWPING COPS -- pops a can of beer and toasts them.  The doors close. \nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO - CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE - DAY \nDUKE rams the key home -- swings the door open. \nDUKE Ah, home at last! \nINT. HOTEL FLAMINGO SUITE - AFTERNOON \nDUKE enters.  The door hits something with a thud. \nA 16-year-old GIRL with the aura of an angry Pit Bull. \nGONZO stands in the bathroom doorway -- stark naked with a drug-addled grin on his face. \n", "test3_id": 1298}

PACIFIC OCEAN - NIGHT \nDUKE cries out as he dives into the ocean.  He lets himself float up through the silvery bubbles... \nDUKE AND GONZO FLOAT BEATIFICALLY IN THE GLOWING, SHIMMERING MOONLIT SURF. \nDUKE (V/O) Our trip was different.  It was to be a classic affirmation of everything right and true in the national character; a gross, physical salute to the fantastic possibilities of life in this country.  But only for those with true grit... \nEXT. AND EVEN FURTHER DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY \nDUKE's intense face. \nDUKE ...and we're chock full of that! \nGONZO Damn right! \nDUKE My attorney understands this concept, despite his racial handicap. But do you?! \nThe HITCHHIKER nods -- giggles -- petrified. \nDUKE (V/O) He said he understood, but I could see in his eyes that he didn't.  He was lying to me. \nGONZO My heart! \nGONZO clutches his heart.  The car veers off the road and screeches to a halt.  He slumps over the wheel. \nGONZO (CONT'D) Where's the medicine? \nDUKE The medicine?  Yes, it's right here. \nDUKE spills out 4 AMYL CAPSULES from a tin. \nDUKE Don't worry, this man has a bad heart... Angina Pectoris.  But we have a cure for it. \nDUKE and GONZO break 2 AMYLS apiece -- INHALE DEEPLY.  GONZO falls back on the seat, staring straight up at the sun.  The HITCHHIKER looks petrified. \nGONZO (suddenly flailing his naked arms at the sky) Turn up the fucking music!  My heart feels like an alligator! Volume!  Clarity!  Bass!  We must have bass!  What's wrong with us? Are you goddamn old ladies? \nDUKE (turns up music to full volume) You scurvy shyster bastard!  Watch your language!  You're talking to a Doctor of Journalism! \nGONZO (laughing uncontrollably) What the fuck are we doing out here? Somebody call the police!  We need help! \nDUKE (to HITCHHIKER) Pay no attention to this swine.  He can't handle the medicine. (he begins laughing) \nGONZO (to the HITCHHIKER) The truth is we're going to Vegas to croak a scag baron named Savage Henry.  I've known him for years but he ripped us off -- and you know what that means, right? \nGONZO pulls out a .357 Magnum -- waves it around. \nGONZO (CONT'D) Savage Henry has cashed his check! We're going to rip his lungs out! \nDUKE And eat them!  That bastard won't get away with this!  What's going on in this country when a scum sucker like that can get away with sandbagging a Doctor of Journalism? \nGONZO cracks ANOTHER AMYL. \nThe HITCHHIKER SCRAMBLES OUT OF THE CAR, DOWN THE TRUNK LID, AND FLEES. \nHITCHHIKER Thanks for the ride.  Thanks a lot. I like you guys.  Don't worry about me. \nDUKE (yells) Wait a minute!  Come back and have a beer! \nThe HITCHHIKER RUNS from car. \nGONZO Good riddance.  That boy made me nervous.  Did you see his eyes? (laughing) Jesus, this is good medicine. \nDUKE glances back at the running HITCHHIKER. \nDUKE (suddenly clambering into the front seat) Move over!!

UNBELIEVABLY FAR DOWN THE ROAD TO LAS VEGAS - DAY \nTHE RED SHARK races -- DUKE at the wheel -- straight ahead driving. \nDUKE (V/O) It was absolutely imperative that we get to the Mint Hotel before the deadline for press registration. Otherwise, we might have to pay for our suite. \nGONZO wrestles with a shaker of COCAINE.  The top comes off and the powder swirls away on the wind. \nGONZO Oh, Jesus!  Did you see what god just did to us? \nDUKE God didn't do that!  You did it! You're a fucking narcotics agent, that was our cocaine, you pig! \nGONZO (waving his .357 Magnum at Duke) You better be careful.  Plenty of vultures out here.  They'll pick your bones clean before morning. \nDUKE You whore! \nGONZO tears up a BLOTTER OF ACID. \nGONZO Here -- chew this.  It's your half of the acid. \nDUKE takes his half -- chews it. \nDUKE How long do I have? \nGONZO Maybe thirty more minutes.  As your attorney, I advise you to drive at top speed.  It'll be a goddamn miracle if we can get there before you turn into a wild animal.  Are you ready for that?  Checking into a Vegas hotel under a phony name with intent to commit capital fraud and a head full of acid. \nDUKE (V/O) Thirty minutes.  It was going to be very close. \nThe RED SHARK screams along the highway past a billboard: \"DON'T GAMBLE WITH MARIJUANA! \\ IN NEVADA: POSSESSION - 20 YEARS; SALE - LIFE!!\" \nEXT. LAS VEGAS MINT HOTEL - DUSK \nThe RED SHARK pulls up outside the MINT.  A great banner spanning the street announces the MINT 400. \nDUKE can feel the drug surging up inside him.  Clutching a buckled beer can, sweat pouring, he stares fixedly at the TICKET the ATTENDANT gives him. \nDUKE I need this, right? \nATTENDANT I'll remember your face. \nDUKE stares -- losing it... \nDUKE (V/O) There is no way of explaining the terror I felt. \nINT. HOTEL LOBBY - DAY \nDUKE waits in line at the front desk -- RIGID WITH PENT UP ENERGY.  GONZO's ahead of him -- muscling in -- trying to queue jump and failing. \nDUKE (V/O) I was pouring sweat.  My blood is too thick for Nevada.  I've never been able to properly explain myself in this climate. \nA COUPLE move off and DUKE jerks forward -- stops -- eyes fixed on the stony FEMALE RESERVATIONS CLERK. \nDUKE (V/O CONT'D) Be quiet, be calm... name, rank, and press affiliation, nothing else... \nDUKE moves ANOTHER RIGID STEP CLOSER to the desk -- the tension almost snapping him in two.  GONZO's FLAPPING AROUND -- absolutely no success. \nSomething catches DUKE's eye... He REMAINS ROOTED -- his eyes turning to the VEGETAL PAISLEY PATTERNS ON THE CARPET WHICH ARE SHIFTING -- UNDULATING.  THE CARPET PATTERNS ARE INEXORABLY CREEPING UP THE WALLS... \nDUKE (V/O CONT'D) ...ignore this terrible drug, pretend it's not happening... \nThe LAST PEOPLE leave -- with A FINAL, STIFF MOVE, DUKE comes face to face with the RESERVATIONS CLERK...

I HAVE MY ATTORNEY WITH ME, AND I REALIZE OF COURSE... \nAs DUKE stares at her, BABBLING, her FACE BEGINS TO MORPH. He tries to stop it happening by TALKING FASTER. \nDUKE ... THAT HIS NAME IS NOT ON THE LIST, BUT WE MUST HAVE THAT SUITE. YES.  JUST CHECK THE LIST AND YOU'LL SEE.  DON'T WORRY.  WHAT'S THE SCORE HERE?  WHAT'S NEXT? \nDUKE sags -- grips the desk -- WHITE KNUCKLES. \nRESERVATIONS CLERK (hands him an envelope) Your suite's not ready yet.

They were due to go off 10 at a time every 2 minutes. \nDUKE hits the bar. \nDUKE Beer! \nA middle-aged HOODLUM in a T-shirt booms up to the bar. \nHOODLUM God damn!  What day is this -- Saturday? \nDUKE More like Sunday. \nHOODLUM Hah!  That's a bitch, ain't it? Last night I was home in Long Beach and somebody said they were runnin' the Mint 400 today, so I says to my old lady, \"Man, I'm goin'.\" So she gives me a lot of crap about it, so I start slappin' her around, and the next thing you know two guys I never seen before are beating me stupid. \nVOICE OFF Group 4! \nOutside, another batch of motorcycles roar away -- kicking up more clouds of dust. \nHOODLUM Then they gave me ten bucks, put me on a bus, and when I woke up here I was in downtown Vegas, and for a minute all I could think was, \"O Jesus, who's divorcing me this time?\" But then I remembered, by God!

DESERT - DAY \nNothing.  Except for a THICK CLOUD OF DUST. \nBarely visible, a motorcycle comes speeding into the pits. The RIDER staggers off his bike.  The PIT CREW gas it up and sends it back with a FRESH RIDER. \nDUKE watches him disappear back into the dust cloud. \nDUKE (V/O) By 10 they were spread out all over the course.  It was no longer a race, now it was an Endurance Contest.  The idea of trying to \"cover this race\" in any conventional press sense was absurd. \nA HORN HONKS.  A shiny BLACK BRONCO with DRIVER.  LACERDA hangs out of the window. \nLACERDA It's great, isn't it?!  Jump in! \nDUKE gets into the Bronco and they head into the DUST CLOUD. \nEXT.

Through the window -- DUKE and GONZO sit at the counter. \nINT. NORTH STAR COFFEE LOUNGE - NIGHT \nDUKE (V/O) The North Star Coffee Lounge seemed like a fairly safe haven from our storms.  No hassles, no talk.  Just a place to rest and regroup.  I wasn't even hungry. \nGONZO stuffs a hamburger down PAYING NO ATTENTION TO THE BEATING going on outside the window.  Duke reads a newspaper. \nDUKE (V/O) There was nothing in the atmosphere of the North Star to put me on my guard... \nGONZO (to WAITRESS) Two glasses of ice water with ice. \nThe WAITRESS brings the ice water. \nDUKE (V/O) She looked like a burnt out caricature of Jane Russell.

He walks about six feet down the aisle and lifts the receiver of the pay phone. He SLICES IT OFF, then brings the receiver back to his stool and sits down. \nDUKE (V/O) I was stupid with shock -- not knowing whether to run or start laughing. \nGONZO (casual) How much is the lemon meringue pie? \nDUKE (V/O) Her eyes were turgid with fear, but her brain was functioning on some basic motor survival level. \nWAITRESS (blurting -- on automatic) Thirty-five cents! \nGONZO (laughing) I mean the whole pie. \nThe WAITRESS MOANS.  GONZO places a $5 BILL on the counter. \nGONZO Let's say five dollars.  Okay? \nGONZO walks round the counter TAKING THE PIE OUT OF THE DISPLAY CASE. \nDUKE (V/O) The sight of the blade had triggered bad memories.

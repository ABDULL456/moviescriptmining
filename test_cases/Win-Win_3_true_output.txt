KYLE Not really. 
MIKE Yeah. Well good luck with that, pal. 
Kyle looks at Mike. 
MIKE (CONT'D) You'll see. 
INT. MIKE AND JACKIE'S HOUSE - LATER. 
Jackie is waiting. Kyle is on the hot seat. Mike is watching. 
JACKIE Kyle? 
Kyle can barely look at her. 
JACKIE (CONT'D) We can't help you if you don't tell us what's going on. Is there a reason you don't want to go home? 
Kyle remains silent. 
JACKIE (CONT'D) What happened to your eye, Kyle? 
Kyle shifts. Avoiding. 
JACKIE (CONT'D) Kyle. You can trust us. 
Kyle looks up at them. Trust is obviously an issue. 
KYLE I can't live there anymore. 
JACKIE With your Mom? Did she do that to your eye? 
KYLE No. She's not even there. She's in a clinic or hospital or whatever. I'm living with Craig. 
JACKIE Who's Craig? 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 35 CONTINUED: 
KYLE Her boyfriend, I guess, but he's an asshole. 
JACKIE Does she even know you're here? 
KYLE My mom? She doesn't care about me. 
JACKIE How do you know? She's probably worried sick and just doesn't know how to reach you. 
Kyle reaches into his pocket and takes out his cell phone. 
KYLE She could've called, right? 
The sincerity of his question is heartbreaking and Jackie is cut to the quick. She looks at Mike. Brutal. 
EXT. MIKE AND JACKIE'S HOUSE - LATER. 
Kyle is sitting on the back steps and smoking a cigarette. 
INT. MIKE'S AND JACKIE'S HOUSE, BEDROOM - LATER. 
Mike is sitting up in bed. His wheels are spinning. 
JACKIE (O.S.) We don't have a choice now. 
MIKE So what are we gonna do? Adopt him? 
Jackie walks into the room putting on face moisturizer. 
JACKIE No. But I'm not sending him back until I talk to his mother. She better freaking call me back. 
MIKE Honey, I know it's tough but we're not in a position to take care of another kid right now. 
She gets in the bed. 5/15/10 - FULL SHOOTING SCRIPT - WIN WIN 36 CONTINUED: 
JACKIE I don't care. I'm not sending him back there, Mike. I can't. And for the record, I'm not very happy about it either! 
MIKE Then we don't have to do this. 
JACKIE Yes, we do, Mike! We do. It makes me so angry and so damn sad to see that poor kid in that kind of situation. He's just a kid. 
Jackie starts to break. Mike buckles. 
MIKE I know. I know. You're right. 
JACKIE I just want to go to Ohio and...beat the crap out of his mom. 
MIKE Come on. 
JACKIE I do. I want to beat the crap out of her and her stupid boyfriend. 
MIKE OK. 
JACKIE I'm serious. 
MIKE I know. I'm just not sure that beating the crap out of everybody is the best solution.

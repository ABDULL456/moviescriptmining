77 INT. BLACKSMITH FURNACES - DUSK 77 
Lit by the fires of a hundred furnaces, stoked by scores of goblins, a MECHANICAL ARMY is born. Metal plates and moving parts are hammered into shape on enormous anvils and bolted onto tall, ornate, golden figures. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) This was an army that would not eat, drink or grow tired. A heartless, ruthless force made of the purest metal, mined from the depths of the earth. 
78 INT. COURTYARD, CASTLE - DUSK 78 
In perfect ranks, in eerie unison, the golden soldiers line up, filling the entire courtyard, awaiting the King's command. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) The Sigri worked until the winter moon was high in the sky - The CHIEF GOBLIN BLACKSMITH displays three curved segments of gold. He fits them together and holds a completed CROWN directly over the King's head. 
KING I am King Balor, leader of the Golden Army. Is there anyone here who disputes my right??? Silence. Prince NUADA kneels next to his father. The Goblin crowns the King, who lifts his sword. In response- TCHANKKKKK!!!! The new army raises its lances, hailing him. 
79 EXT. HUMAN ENCAMPMENT - NIGHTFALL 79 
As the humans make ready for battle, a tremor shakes the earth. They turn their gaze to the horizon, which bristles with the arms of the approaching troops.

80 EXT. BATTLEFIELD - CONTINUOUS 80 
The fight is brutal. The mechanical soldiers mow down the humans by the hundreds, their swords replaced as needed by battle axes, bludgeons and lances. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) But this army knew no bounds, had no remorse, felt no loyalty, engaging in blind battle with man, woman or child. The horde crushes everything, with swords slicing through armor as if it were paper. Every blow is deadly, precise. The army marches ever onward, like a grinding machine devouring tender flesh. At length, there is no sign of life in the human camp. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D) And as the king gazed upon the earth awash in blood and at the impassive metal faces of the army he had created, his heart grew heavy. Victory was gained at too high a price. This war should never have been waged. The King surveys the carnage. The mechanical soldiers stand in symmetrical ranks awaiting further instructions. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D) And so he arranged a truce: the surviving men would keep to their cities and we children of the Earth would dwell within the forests. This pact, he declared, would be honored by our sons and the sons of their sons until the end of time. Listening to his father, Prince Nuada reacts with anguish. 
PRINCESS (V.0.) (CONT'D) But my brother did not believe in the promises of men. He marched off into exile, vowing to return if the Sons of the Earth ever needed him. Prince Nuada walks away towards a dying sunset. 
81 INT. STORAGE CHAMBER - NIGHT 
The goblins lock the golden army into a huge cavern, under the light of ten thousand flickering torches. 
HELLBOY 2 51 
PRINCESS (V.0.) And the golden army was ordered to lie dormant, locked inside the earth itself - and there it is to this day, waiting for the wearer of the crown to command it again. 
82 INT. MAPMAKER'S SHOP - NIGHT 82 
The Princess finishes her tale. Hellboy and Johann look at each other. 
HELLBOY Where is that crown?? 
PRINCESS My father had it destroyed. Cut into three pieces. One for mankind... She holds up her piece of the puzzle, which dangles from a chain around her neck. 
PRINCESS .Two for the sons of the Earth. 
ABE So, you do need our help..? 
PRINCESS I'm afraid it's the other way around. She holds the CYLINDER she purchased. 
PRINCESS The location of the Golden Army is contained within this cylinder-- She opens it and produces a parchment hidden inside. She extends it: the map just shows three coordinates. 
ABE Just a global chart, Edo - that's the old name for Tokyo - Moscow, and Renvyle here- 
PRINCESS But nothing else- She rolls back the map into the cylinder. 
PRINCESS So far, this is a family matter. To intervene will bring nothing but trouble. 
HELLBOY 2 52 
HELLBOY Good, I like trouble.

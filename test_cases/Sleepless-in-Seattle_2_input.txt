his eyes well with 
tears) 
Oh babe.  I miss you so much it 
hurts. 
He reaches out for her.  She's gone. 
And we hear the television set now counting down to 
midnight in New York. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY IN BALTIMORE - NIGHT 
The same television show counting down to midnight. 
Champagne corks popping, etc. 
And we see Walter and Annie. 
WALTER 
Happy New Year, darling. 
ANNIE 
Happy New Year. 
They start to dance. 
WALTER 
I was thinking, I have to go up 
to Boston for the AAP 
convention and then visit 
Winston-Hughes about switching 
over our computers.  Why don't 
we meet in New York for 
Valentine's Day weekend? 
ANNIE 
Walter, I'd love to -- 
WALTER 
We'll stay at the Plaza -- 
ANNIE 
Go for a walk in Central Park -- 
WALTER 
Go to the Symphony -- 
A beat. 
ANNIE 
We will? 
(beat) 
The Symphony? 
(beat) 
Okay. 
(beat) 
I'll take you to the Russian 
Tea Room for pelmeni. 
WALTER 
What is it? 
ANNIE 
It's delicious, trust me. 
WALTER 
Does it have wheat in it? 
ANNIE 
I don't think so. 
They go on dancing.  It's one of those parties where 
everyone looks so happy and so in love.  Annie, however, 
looks thoughtful. 
ET.  MARINA PARKING AREA - DAY 
Sam gets out of his car and starts down the dock toward 
his houseboat.  He's carrying a bag of groceries. 
In the parking lot is a U.S.  MAIL TRUCK. 
EXT. HOUSEBOAT - DAY 
Sam approaches his boat and a puzzled look comes over 
his face. 
A MAILMAN with a sack of mail is standing outside the 
front door of the houseboat.  Jonah is signing a receipt 
for the mail. 
JONAH 
Look at this, Dad.  They're 
all for you -- 
Sam picks up an envelop and looks at it.  It's 
addressed to Sleepless in Seattle c/o Dr.  Marcia 
Fieldstone, Radio Station KWRS in Chicago.  He's 
stunned.  As he signs the receipt: 
MAILMAN 
If you're having trouble 
sleeping, you might want to try 
drinking a glass of water from 
the other side. 
JONAH 
I thought that was for hiccups. 
MAILMAN 
Does it work for hiccups? 
JONAH 
For hiccups, a spoonful of 
sugar, you hold it in your 
mouth for a minute. 
MAILMAN 
Really? 
The mailman starts back toward the mail truck. 
Sam and Jonah start toward the door. 
INT. HOUSEBOAT - NIGHT 
Sam is in the kitchen making dinner.  Jonah is sitting 
at the table, reading the letters from the stack they 
found by the door. 
SAM 
Just out of curiosity, how did 
they get our address? 
JONAH 
They called and asked for it. 
(reading) 
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle. 
You are the most attractive man 
I've ever laid ears on." 
Jonah rolls his eyes, tosses the letter into a pile of 
rejects, opens another. 
SAM 
How did they get our phone 
number? 
JONAH 
You have to give them your 
phone number or they won't let 
you go on the air. 
Sam nods as if this makes perfect sense. 
JONAH 
(continues, reading) 
"Dear Sleepless in Seattle: I 
am an SWF"-- 
(to Sam)

What's left of a small fire is nothing but smoldering ash. Bridger crouches beside Glass, pouring a thin stream of broth between his lips. Fitzgerald reaches in... grabs Glass' Anstadt leaning against the tree. 
FITZGERALD I'll take first watch. 
BRIDGER Not with his rifle. 
FITZGERALD Trust me, kid, he ain't gonna be needin' it tonight. 
Fitzgerald disappears into the trees. 
EXT. WILDERNESS - DAY 
Pig stands on a ridge, scouting a course. He waves back to Henry and the others. They start toward him. 
EXT. CAMP - EVENING 
Glass conscious on the ground... that same labored breathing. 
CUT TO: 
GLASS' POV - ON FITZGERALD... 
...smiling down at Glass as he grabs the Anstadt, holds it... runs his hand down the barrel, as comfortable as if it were his own. 
FITZGERALD You were right to protect this. 
Then he disappears... and we're left alone, staring up at the branches above us... the evening sky... accompanied by Glass' deathly breaths. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. WILDERNESS/CREEK - DAY 
Bridger kneels beside the stream, filling canteens. 
EXT. CAMP - DAY 
Fitzgerald sits bored against a tree, twisting a knife in his hands... flipping it point first into the dirt... grabbing... repeating... twist... flip... thwack. And as he does, his eyes are locked on Glass. 
Finally, Fitzgerald snaps the knife from the dirt, stands, and walks over to Glass. Glass is asleep. Fitzgerald crouches down over him... eyes his red, infected wounds. 
FITZGERALD (WHISPERS) When are you gonna die, boy? 
Fitzgerald reaches out with the blade... gently touches one of the threads holding Glass' throat together. And when he does, GLASS' EYES FLY OPEN... focus on Fitzgerald. 
Fitzgerald doesn't even flinch... just holds that knife tip there against Glass' throat. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'm nearly a week behind Henry's bunch on accounta havin' to tend to you. Be easier on us all if you'd take that last breath. 
The two men hold a stare... until Fitzgerald pulls back the knife... grabs a bloodstained rag from beside them... balls it up in his fist. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I could help ya with that if you'd like. Muzzle ya right now... end all this sufferin' quick and easy. Nobody'd ever know you give up. 
Fitzgerald moves the rag over Glass' nose and mouth... holds it there, just inches above. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) You just gimme a blink if you want me to do it. 
Glass locks his eyes on Fitzgerald's... both men unblinking. 
A DROP OF BLOOD hangs from the rag... finally falls... lands on Glass' lips. 
Fitzgerald almost smiles, waiting for the inevitable... as Glass stares back, fighting the urge to blink. 
Suddenly Bridger's hand clamps down on Fitzgerald's shoulder. Fitzgerald spins... startled. 
BRIDGER (O.S.) What's goin' on? 
Fitzgerald jumps with a start, sees it's Bridger, and is pissed that Bridger scared him... and interrupted his business. He rises quickly, planting his meaty hand in Bridger's chest, and SLAMMING HIM BACK AGAINST A TREE. 
FITZGERALD Don't you ever question me, you little piss-ant. 
Bridger tries to fight back, but Fitzgerald's too strong... holds him pressed against the tree... slams a heavy elbow into Bridger's mouth, splitting his lip. 
FITZGERALD (CONT'D) I'd just as soon leave both you and your nigger here to rot. `Cept killin' you ain't worth givin' up your share. (LEANS CLOSER) But that don't mean I can't be coaxed into changin' my mind.

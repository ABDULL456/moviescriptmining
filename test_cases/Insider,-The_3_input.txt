She nods, studying him.  They get up. 
INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, LOUISVILLE - DAY 
The house is nearly empty.  Liane, arms folded across her chest, is quietly standing in the empty living room.  Jeffrey comes down the stairs... 
WIGAND That's it... 
And it's quiet.  And Liane holds herself, overcome... 
LIANE (beat) That's where our babies were born... Debbie took her first steps, right there...in the grass. 
And they're quiet. 
LIANE (CONT'D) I didn't plan on this... 
Liane looks at him, afraid.  And as he moves to hold her. 
WIGAND Hey, hey, hey, c'mon.  C'mon.  We can make this work for us.  Okay?  It's just...it's a smaller scale. Simpler...easier...more time.  More time together.  More time with the kids.  More time for us, okay?  It's just...  Can you imagine me coming home from some job feeling good at the end of the day?  This is gonna be better.  This is gonna be better. 
And instead of this downturn turning them against each other, it brings them closer together.  And as they stand in the empty house... 
INT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE - DAY 
We see unpacked boxes in the small 1970's kitchen.  Country- western music is playing on a radio.  And we see Liane busily putting things away in a cabinet.  And, then, stops and looks out the window.  She tightens a knob on a cabinet.  There's a moment of domestic peace for her as she sees... 
EXT. THE WIGANDS' NEW HOUSE, THE BACKYARD - DAY 
Jeffrey with the Girls in a part of the backyard, kneeling in the dirt, planting a vegetable garden, putting in some small tomato trellises.  We see the house, now.  It's a small, one story.  Deborah sees her mom and waves.  It's an image from the 1950's post-war boom.  Liane waves back from behind the pane of glass... 
INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Jeffrey's asleep on his side next to Liane, her back to him. His arm is draped over her, protectively.  There's a sound. He turns.  And he sees Barbara in her nightgown, standing in the doorway... 
WIGAND Hey, baby.  What's wrong? 
BARBARA (terrified, whispers) What's that outside, Daddy? 
WIGAND Did you see somebody or did you hear them? 
BARBARA I heard them. 
WIGAND Where? 
BARBARA In the backyard. 
Fast, soundlessly, he's out of bed into old moccasins and trousers... 
INT. THE WIGANDS' HOUSE, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT 
Jeffrey goes into a corner of the basement, around the corner from the furnace, where his "office" is now.  Unpacked boxes are on the floor.  He fumbles with the combination lock on a small gun safe, lifts the lid, taking out a hand gun. Barbara followed him. 
WIGAND Sit at Daddy's desk, okay?  Why don't you just sit up at the desk.  Get out some paper and draw me a picture, okay?  What are you gonna draw me, baby?  An animal, something like that?  You stay down here until Daddy gets back...alright, Barbara? You stay down here. 
He keeps it hidden from Barbara.  He goes up the stairs. 
EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT 
It's still.  He steps further out onto the lawn with its dark shrubs and small tree in the corner. 
INT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BASEMENT - LATE NIGHT 
Meanwhile, Barbara in the basement, starts as the water heater comes on, scaring her.  She goes up the stairs to follow after her father... 
EXT. WIGANDS' HOUSE #2, BACKYARD - LATE NIGHT 
Meanwhile, Jeffrey has crossed towards the darker back corners.  Sudden rustling.  He spins, gun ready.  And the yellow eyes of a RACCOON stare at him. 
WIGAND (to himself) You almost got your damn head blown off... 
The raccoon defiantly bares its teeth. 
Jeffrey starts to go...but he sees something and stops... 
Meanwhile, Barbara has come to the sliding glass door... 
Jeffrey sees one of the tomato trellises is crushed, stepped on...and in the vegetable garden's earth, are distinct, fresh, deep FOOTPRINTS... 
BARBARA'S VOICE (OVER) Daddy... 
Wigand steps between her and the garden, hiding it... EXTREMELY CLOSE ON JEFFREY, as he covers, trying to keep from his daughter the invasion, trying to control his emotions...

Can't we talk this over? 
The tough pulls his fist back to strike Drew, who has been grabbed by two other toughs, his arms pinned behind his back. 
Suddenly, a figure FLIES in and SLAMS the tough to the ground. 
It is Gao, and he immediately sets on the other toughs. The room ERUPTS in a melee as the disciples go at it with the village toughs. 
The girls are SCREAMING as the boys kick and punch. 
The disciples are winning, having a great time, until the door to the room SLAMS open and the HEADMISTRESS comes storming in, screaming at the top of her lungs for them to stop. 
ANGLE ON DREW, GAO AND THE DISCIPLES 
As they all agree as one to hightail out of there. They go running past the Headmistress and out the door, full speed.

DREW Did you say you were going to keep us OUT of trouble? The group pauses for a BEAT, then they all laugh, relaxing. INT. DINNER ROOM ­ DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF GAO CARRYING A PLATE OF CHINESE FOOD OVER TO A TABLE WHERE THE DISCIPLES EATING, THEIR EYES SCANNING THE ROOM FOR SIGNS OF WARNING. Gao sits down and looks around. They are all dressed in their training clothes, dirtied after a full day of training. GAO I can't believe nobody's said anything! It's been a whole day! 
LI 
We broke every major rule the temple has, how could we get away with it? 
DREW 
I think we might have. If they knew, they'd have already gotten us! You guys just have to stop looking so guilty. 
ANGLE ON WU 
Who pushes his dinner away from him. 
WU 
I've lost my appetite. 
DREW 
Let's go back to the dorm for a few minutes, go over our stories in case they seperate us... 
He gets up to leave, and the others follow him. LI 
Seperate us? EXT. COURTYARD ­ SAME DAY IN THE COURTYARD ARE SEVERAL POLICEMEN, WAITING AROUND. Drew and the others spot the cops, and walk quickly to their dorm room. INT. DORM ROOM ­ SAME DAY DREW AND THE OTHERS ARE FRANTIC. 
DREW 
Cops! Somebody called the cops?!? Before anyone can answer, the door opens and the D.S. walks into the room, his face serious. D.S. Drew! Come with me to San De's chamber... He turns to go, but the others are on their feet, ready to follow Drew. D.S. Just Drew. Drew looks at them and shrugs, then follows the D.S. INT. SAN DE CHAMBER ­ EVENING 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF SAN DE AND THE GIRLS SCHOOL HEADMISTRESS. 
Also in the room are two high-ranking police officials. The Headmistress is yelling at the top of her lungs, and San De is just sitting there, letting her vent. She has obviously been going at it for some time, because her face is sweaty and flushed. She stops when Drew and the D.S. enter and points an accusing finger at Drew. 
HEADMISTRESS 
He's the one! 
SAN DE 
Drew, I think you know Headmistress Low. Correct? 
Drew can only nod. 
SAN DE (CONT'D) 
The police have also come. A morals violation is what brought them... 
Drew's head snaps up at the words "morals charge" POLICE LIEUTENANT We demand that he leaves the temple, and China! POLICE CAPTAIN He's a disgrace, to the temple and to this country. He must leave. They all agree that Drew should leave, and for a moment the sound of the three of them agreeing fills the room (ad libs). ANGLE ON DREW Who is staring down into the abyss. SAN DE

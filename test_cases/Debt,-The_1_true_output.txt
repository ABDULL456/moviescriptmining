STEPHAN Bitte sehr. 
The two continue on their way, and we follow the smartly dressed man, closing in on his hand, in which he now holds his keys AND THE LOCKET. 
We see him tuck it into his jacket pocket as he walks on. 
61    EXT. RAILWAY STATION - FOOTBRIDGE - EARLY EVENING            61 
The FOOTBRIDGE which crosses over a closed RAILWAY STATION below. On either side of the bridge runs a barbed wire topped FENCE. A few PEDESTRIANS cross the bridge in the early evening gloom, intent on getting home. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   28. 
David and Stephan appear, walking over the bridge towards us. David's eyes flick to the tracks ahead and below as a TRAIN begins to thunder by. 
Stephan begins to COUNT softly to himself as the train runs below his feet. 
STEPHAN One, two, three, four, five, six... 
DAVID (O.S.) It's a ghost station... 
62    INT. KITCHEN. SAFE-HOUSE - EVENING                           62 
A hand-drawn plan of a RAILWAY STATION is on the table. 
David indicates the tracks on the plan. DAVID West Berlin trains pass through East Berlin on this track, but don't stop. 
STEPHAN Usually. 
He raises a lighter to the cigarette in his mouth. 
MATCH CUT TO: 
63    EXT. RAILWAY BRIDGE - EVENING                                63 As the train disappears into the gloom and Stephan slows to light his cigarette. Beside him David's eyes flick to the STATION PLATFORM in between the tracks below, eerily lit in the gathering dusk. 
DAVID'S P.O.V - several BORDER GUARDS patrol the abandoned platform. 
DAVID (V.O.) The station's guarded at all times... 
We're TRACKING PAST the entrance to stairs leading down from the bridge onto the platform below. We see it's been sealed off with a locked gate. Another BORDER GUARD stands on the stairs below, staring up at us as we pass...

David indicates the point on the plan. 
DAVID ...and the stairs to the platform are sealed off. 
65    EXT. RAILWAY BRIDGE - EVENING                                65 
The two men have walked on past the mid-point of the bridge. David glances at the far track. 
DAVID'S P.O.V - the track runs along the far side of the platform. On the other side of the track is a barbed-wire topped WIRE FENCE. 
DAVID (V.O.) Our train driver makes an unscheduled stop on the near track. STEPHAN (V.O.) The last two carriages will be around...

Stephan indicates a point on the track. 
STEPHAN ...here. And they will be empty. Once that train has stopped, the guards won't be able to see this fence. And on the other side of the fence is... 
67    EXT. THE RAILWAY BRIDGE - EVENING                            67 
The two men are at the top of the stairs on the other side of the bridge now. Stephan glances to his right... 
STEPHEN'S P.O.V - TRACKING as we descend the stairs. We can see that on the other side of that high wire fence is a CAR PARK and a long, low building... 
STEPHAN (V.O.) ...a postal depot. 
We see that car park is lined with the yellow VANS of Deutsche Post. Several FEMALE POSTAL WORKERS in dark skirts and white blouses stand around the car park on their breaks, smoking and chatting. As we watch one of the vans trundles out of the OPEN FACTORY GATE. FINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT WITH PINK AMENDMENTS - 26.03.09   30. 
STEPHAN (V.O.) The vans come and go all day long.

David rolls up the plan. 
DAVID We're just one more parcel. Once we're in West Berlin there'll be transport to Templehof airbase and a private charter. 
Stephan stubs out his cigarette. 
STEPHAN That's the wrapping. Now all we need is the present. Rachel realises both men are looking at her.

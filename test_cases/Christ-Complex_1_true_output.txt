QUINN Your new friend is dangerous. 
LOUIS So is yours. 
QUINN Leave her out of this. 
LOUIS You fighting tomorrow morning Quinn? 
QUINN It's over. This whole thing is nuts. I'm walking away. 
LOUIS Let me walk away from you first then. 
Louis starts to walk away from Quinn. He turns around as he continues to walk backwards. 
LOUIS (CONT'D) I'm coming at you! You are in this game like it or not! 
EXT. ORPHANAGE-DAY 
Zoey's car pulls up in front of an historic brick building. She slowly gets out and starts to look the structure over. It's almost like she is trying to assess if she has the right place. 
INT. ORPHANAGE-CONTINUOUS 
A awkward young man, JAKE, is sorting through boxes. He's kneeled on the floor organizing a mess of files. Zoey walks up and tries to attract his attention. 
ZOEY Excuse me? 
Jake comes out of his world of file sorting. He looks up at Zoey. 
JAKE (monotone) Yes. 
Jake stands. 
ZOEY I'm looking for Mrs. Rhodes. I believe the people here referred to her as "mother". 
JAKE (monotone) People look for a lot of things. 
Zoey is confused. 
ZOEY I'm sure they do. (looking at the boxes) You guys shutting down? 
JAKE (monotone) We are ceasing operations. 
ZOEY Is there something wrong with you? 
MRS. RHODES, a 60 year old odd looking lady, comes out of the back. 
MRS. RHODES Calm down. You need to calm down and count to ten. 
ZOEY What? I don't know what that means. 
Mrs. Rhodes starts waving her hands at Zoey. She flaps them up and down in her face.

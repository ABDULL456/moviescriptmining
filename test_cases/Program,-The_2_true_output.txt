JOE I want a rematch. 
CAMILLE A rematch? 
JOE Some other sport. I took my beating. You owe me one. Either that or we go out. 
Camille considers, tries to figure out what she'd dislike least, knowing it'd be cheap to choose neither. 
CAMILLE I'll think about it. 
Camille walks off, disappearing through the gate. Joe walks off in the other direction. Bud Lite and Bobby follow. 
BOBBY Real good date, Joe. Remind me to take her out. 
FADE OUT: 
FADE IN: 
EXT. E.S.U. CAMPUS - MORNING 
Opening day of school. We take CUTS of students arriving, football players checking out the new girls from atop the wall of the athletic dorm, Louanne and Autumn greeting returning sisters at the sorority, students registering for classes etc. 
INT. ACADEMIC ADVISOR'S OFFICE - MORNING 
Darnell sits across from WILLIAM SMITH, Academic Advisor. 
ADVISOR SMITH Darnell, I've reviewed your placement test and I'm afraid you failed to meet our entrance requirements in two areas. 
DARNELL What does that mean? I can't play football? 
ADVISOR SMITH No. It means you're going to have to take some remedial classes, what we call "zero level" courses. Specifically Math 0 and English 0. 
Darnell is clearly deflated by this painful indication of his academic standing. 
ADVISOR SMITH You won't get college credit for them, but they will help you prepare to take the Placement Test again at the end of the quarter. If you pass at that time you'll be able to officially enter the university and take college level courses. You'll still be able to take an American History survey course, but it won't count on your record until you pass the Placement Test. But first things first. To start, I'm approving a tutor for you. 
DARNELL A tutor? I don't need no tutor. 
ADVISOR SMITH Any tutor. And yes you do. 
INT. ATHLETIC DEPARTMENT CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY 
A meeting of the football brain trust; Coach Winters, Athletic Director, GALEN HOWARD, a publicist, SHARON BRAVER, and the Sports Information Director (S.I.D.) LARRY NICHOLS. Also present is Joe Kane, somewhat discomfited at being the center of all this attention. 
HOWARD I think both Joe and the university are best served by a straightforward Heisman campaign. Nothing too gimmicky. 
BRAVER We've compiled a mailing list of around 1300 opinion makers; newspapers, football writers, and sports anchors. First we send them a packet on Joe and his achievements. Bio, stats, plus human interest stuff; commitment to academics, charity work, etc. Then we update it each week with a postcard. Heisman voters hate opening envelopes. 
Joe is increasingly uneasy with all this. 
JOE I haven't really done any charity work... 
BRAVER You're gonna start. We've got some things lined up. 
NICHOLS Unfortunately, because we weren't in the top 20 last year, we only have one network T.V. game to give Joe national exposure. Although it's a good one; Michigan. But we'll also be taping all our other games and buying satellite time. That way we can produce our own highlight package and interview pieces and send them out to T.V. stations all over the country for their sportscasts. 
WINTERS Any questions, Joe? 
If Joe was uneasy before, he's overwhelmed now. He tries not to show it. After all, who could turn down a Heisman campaign? Still it's a megaton of pressure. 
JOE Ah, no... I just... you really think I got a shot to win this? 
WINTERS Hell, yes. Plus it's a good thing for the program. Publicizes the school, gives a boost to recruiting, and it's a great thing for you. Jumps up your draft position, the size of your first contract, everything. It's a hell of an opportunity. 
NICHOLS All you gotta do is back it up on the field, and we have no doubts about that, cause we know "Kane is Able." 
Nichols holds up a black CAMPAIGN BUTTON with the phrase "Kane is Able" enblazoned on it in gold letters. This gets a rise out of everyone except Joe, who's still not sure about all this. 
INT. JOE KANE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
Joe lies on his bed, staring up at the ceiling, unable to get to sleep. 
INT. CAMILLE'S BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT 
The phone rings. Camille, who's been asleep, rolls over and answers it.

EXT. TREEHOUSE - SAME TIME 
We watch over Kenny's shoulder as Leonard falls from the treehouse, smacks his head on the tree trunk and comes to a crash upon some rocks. Kenny runs over and finds Leonard unconscious. 
KENNY Wake up!   Wake up, kid! 
Off the treehouse, which is now a towering inferno - 
INT. TWIN'S HOUSE - PARENT'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME 
Ashley jumps up from a deep sleep. There is terror on her face. She rushes over to her DESK and turns on the LAMP. Ken is awakened by her. 
JIM Ashley?    What is it? 
ASHLEY I forgot to deposit your paycheck last week. 
JIM But I already wrote some checks. 
ASHLEY I know. With the cookout and everything, I forgot. I'll deposit it tomorrow. The holiday should buy us an extra day. 
JIM Write yourself a note so you don't forget again. 
ASHLEY I just did. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Ashley turns off the desk lamp and returns to bed. 
ASHLEY (cont'd) Goodnite. 
FADE TO BLACK: 
SFX OVER BLACK : TELEPHONE RINGING 
FADE IN: 
EXT. GRAVEYARD - WEEKS LATER - AFTERNOON 
ON JIM and ASHLEY, watching Rudy's casket as it is lowered into the ground. The once spirited, couple now looks tired and pained. They are accompanied by a number of mourners. 
PRIEST Rest in piece, Rudolph Eugene Carges. May God hold you in the palm of his hand. 
Jacob stands beside his parents. Tears stream from his eyes, across his birthmark and off his chin. So stricken with grief, Jacob barely has to energy to wipe the tears away. 
We continue on through the crowd and find Malee. Embarrassed by the tears, she brings a black veil down over her face. 
INT. YACCO'S OFFICE - LATER THAT DAY 
Malee enters, still wearing the veil. She crosses to the couch and sits beside A PATIENT, GUS MAITLAND (30), long haired, hippi-type with a moustache and beard. Gus eyes Malee, intrigued. 
GUS Friend or family? 
MALEE Huh? 
GUS The person who died. 
MALEE Friend. 
GUS I'm sorry. You'll like Dr. Chung. This is only my second session, but she's good. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MALEE I'm not a patient.     I'm her daughter. 
Malee lifts her veil and looks at Gus. 
GUS Oh.     I can see the resemblance. 
MALEE Are you trying to make me sick? 
Gus shoots Malee a look just as Yacco exits her office. 
YACCO Mr. Maitland? 
Gus rises and enters the office. 
YACCO (CONT'D) (cont'd) I'll be with you in a second.

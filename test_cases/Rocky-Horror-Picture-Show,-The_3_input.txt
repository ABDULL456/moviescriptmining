FRANK He'll eat nutritious high protein And swallow raw eggs. Try to build up his shoulders, His chest, arms and legs. 
Such an effort - If he only knew of my plan. In just seven days, 
GUESTS, RIFF, MAGENTA & COLUMBIA & FRANK I can make you a ma-aa-a-a-an 
ROCKY throws down the weights and begins press ups. 
FRANK He'll do press-ups and chin-ups, Do the snatch, clean and jerk. 
FRANK crosses to JANET & BRAD 
He thinks dynamic tension Must be hard work. Such strenuous living I just don't understand. 
FRANK moves back to ROCKY who is still pressing up. 
When, in just seven days - Oh baby...(ROCKY jumps up.) 
I can make you A ma-a-a-a-an...(laugh). 
75	INT.	LABORATORY: REFRIGERATOR	NIGHT 
The large refrigeration unit door slowly opens, falling like a drawbridge.  Inside is a wall of ice and many CocaCola bottles. Through these bursts an icy EDDIE riding a Harley Davidson motor bike, ex World War II, holding a Gibson guitar. 
Several guests are crushed to death. 
COLUMBIA Eddie! 
EDDIE Stay cool baby. 
JANET Who's Eddie? 
RIFF RAFF The delivery boy. 
MAGENTA His delivery wasn't good enough though. 
ROCKY looks terrified. 
JANET has fainted yet again. 
EDDIE comes to life. 
76	SONG:		"WHAT EVER HAPPENED TO SATURDAY NIGHT" 
EDDIE Whatever happened to Saturday night When you dressed up sharp And you felt alright It don't seem the same since cosmic light Came into my life and I thought I was divine. 
COLUMBIA leaps on to the pillion seat. 
I used to go for a ride with a chick who'd go And listen to the music on the radio. 
The MOTORCYCLISTS GUESTS remember only too well. 
A saxophone was blowing on a rock and roll show And we climbed in the back And we really had a good time 
COLUMBIA rushes to the switchboard, flicks a lighting switch and all the lights above the stairs start changing colour. 
The GUESTS go crazy and rock and roll all over the staircase. 
COLUMBIA dances with EDDIE. 
Even RIFF RAFF and MAGENTA step it out. 
ALL Hot patootie Bless my soul I really love that rock and roll (four times) 
EDDIE (more confident, less frozen) leaps onto the motorbike in a legs apart guitar strumming pose. 
FRANK is getting furious. 
ROCKY is perplexed. 
EDDIE My head used to swim From the perfume I smelled. My hands kind of fumbled With her white plastic belt. I'd taster her baby pink lipstick, And that's when I'd melt. And she'd whisper in my ear, Tonight she really was mine.

PATRICK Wouldn't be the first time. 
She stops.     Regards him.      He stops.    Regards her. Stalemate. 
SARA Screw you.      I'm brilliant. 
He goes into a spin, a half-split, comes out of it swaggering and half-stepping around her. Sara gives him an impish look. Rises up on full pointe, turns out her legs and lifts one of them in a spiral just below his head. It happens in two blinks. So fast Patrick thinks it was a mirage. He stares at her, dumbfounded. Sara smiles. The look on his face is worth the pain in her joints. She blows some stray hair out of her face, puts her hands on her hips. Looks appropriately hapless. 
SARA I didn't get it. That thing you just did. Show me again? 
PATRICK What was that shit you just did? 
He mimes the move -- badly.        Sara can't help it.       She laughs. 
SARA A releve.    Over ice.     With a twist. (MORE)

SARA (CONT'D) (succumbs to his bewilderment) Ballet. I used to dance, Patrick. 
PATRICK You used to dance? 
SARA Uh-huh. Used to as in don't any more. And don't ask me why. 
She sounds suddenly defensive.       Patrick's suddenly intrigued. 
PATRICK Why not? 
SARA Because I don't want to talk about it. 
PATRICK That's why you brought it up. Did that whole relieve thing. 'Cause you don't wanna talk about it? 
SARA Because it's not a big deal.       Can we just concentrate on this? 
PATRICK Yeah, we can concentrate. (a beat; goading her a little) But I think it is a big deal. Whatever it is you don't wanna talk about. 
Sara shakes her head adamantly. He nods his head emphatically. Another stalemate. They dance coyly, seductively around it.

Sara. Doing stretching exercises as she talks on the phone. 
LINDSAY (V.O.) (over phone) I'm still gonna pray for you. (MORE)

LINDSAY (V.O.) (CONT'D) Jesus, Sara, you're in the freaking ghetto. Forget the riots. How are you supposed to meet anybody? 
Sara slides down the wall, hugs her knees. 
SARA (into phone) I have met somebody. Sort of.       I think. I mean, there's this guy... 
111   INT. REYNOLDS' APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM/CHENILLE'S                111 BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Patrick enters to hear CHRISTOPHER SCREAMING his lungs out. He passes down the hall to Chenille's room to find Christopher squirming in Kenny's arms. Kenny doesn't know what to do. 
PATRICK (walking in) What y'all doin' to my nephew? 
Patrick takes Christopher, holds him and consoles him until he settles down. Patrick pointedly hands the baby to Chenille, glares accusingly at her and Kenny as he quits the room. Kenny regards his son haplessly. Looks at Chenille. 
KENNY Why's he do that? 
CHENILLE He's a baby.   They cry. 
KENNY He was screaming, Chenille. 
CHENILLE He don't know you, Kenny. 
KENNY I'm his father. He knows me. (meaning now) ... What should I do? 
CHENILLE Come around more often.

KENNY See?    I can't talk to you. 
CHENILLE And I can't depend on you! Am I askin' you to do anything for him you ain't supposed to do?

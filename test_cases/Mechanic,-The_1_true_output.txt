STEVE Who is he? 
BISHOP He owns the watch store. 
STEVE I know. I meant... what did he do? Bishop comes close, FOCUSED. 
BISHOP I've taught you how to kill without anyone knowing there was a murder. I've taught you to be invisible. But that's strategy, not killing. The real test... it's the actual killing, isn't it? 
STEVE Bishop... 
BISHOP Do you want this? Be very sure. Because you can walk away. 
STEVE No. I'm ready. Bishop studies him... nods. Turns to go. 
STEVE (CONT'D) Bishop... We're right here, where you wanted us to wind up. You knew where I'd hit you, didn't you? 
BISHOP ...School's out. Bishop leaves. Steve watches him go. Stuck. Helpless. He turns back. The Owner is headed home for the day. 
INT. SUSHI RESTAURANT - NIGHT 
Bishop sits back at his reserved table in the rear of the place. In a chair next to him, the doll is awkwardly perched. Around him, people LAUGH. Lovers NUZZLE.. He reaches into his breast pocket, slides out a new DHL envelope, tears it open. A new jump-drive slides onto the table. He eats, takes pills, his eyes locked on the drive. 
BISHOP (to Luna doll) Who do you think that is, Luna? He takes a card out of his wallet, studies it. It's from the flirtatious doctor. He pulls out his phone, dials. 
EXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT 
Steve sits in a nondescript car, lights out, parked. STEVE'S P.O.V.: Two stories up, a lit apartment. The WATCH STORE OWNER crosses by one of the lit windows. 
INT. WATCH STORE OWNER'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The Owner has a delicate vintage Brietlang in his hands. He places it on a patch of velvet, watch-repair tools laid next to it. He moves to an old stereo, puts the needle of a turn- table down on spinning vinyl. The lonely sounds of Brahms Piano Concerto No. 2 fill the room. He returns to his desk, sits. A tiny noise from the hall. A "click." He looks up, sees nothing, settles in to work... 
TRACKING ACROSS THE ROOM To the front HALLWAY. Steve stands in the hallway, motionless. He's just closed the front door behind him. In his hands, a lock-pick set which he now pockets and pulls out the gun Bishop gave him. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON BISHOP. No way to tell where he is. He's holding the Luna doll. He reaches forward, knocks on a door. 
WOMAN'S VOICE 
(FROM INSIDE) It's open! 
INT. HIGH RISE APARTMENT - NIGHT 
The WOMAN's apartment. Not the doctor's, the same we've been to before. Everything eerily identical to the last time. Sofas, gas fire, throws and rugs, open bottle of wine. 
WOMAN'S VOICE I'll just be a minute. A GLIMPSE of the woman in her bedroom, topless in front of a vanity. She glances back, smiles warm. Laughs a little when she sees the doll. 
BISHOP It's for a friend. Bishop awkwardly sets the doll down near the front door, moves on, into the apartment. Restless. 
BISHOP (CONT'D) I'm sorry I was away so long this time. I had some complications -- 
WOMAN'S VOICE Don't be. He turns. She's emerged from the bedroom, adjusting the dress she's just pulled on. Beautiful. She comes up to him, kisses him. He doesn't respond. She backs off, moves to the kitchen to pour two wines, 
WOMAN You know who I saw yesterday? 
(BEAT) Bradley Fliescher. He and Ginny have this little cottage up the coast they hardly use. I was thinking, maybe next week you and I should go. Approaching, handing him a wine. 
WOMAN (CONT'D) You and me, the whole weekend. What would we... do? She approaches him, sexy. Touches him, intimate. He stares at her, blank. She recovers fast, moves off.

SHARON For good reason. Remember? 
LARRY Let's just leave it. 
She stares, then... 
SHARON You're still scared of him. 
Pissed, he throws his hammer down on the plywood, turns to her. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
LARRY I don't think it's a good idea you coming around here in uniform. People see it, they think we're in trouble here. 
SHARON Nice seeing you, too. 
She walks away.     He frowns, picks up his hammer, goes back to work. 
ON STREET 
As Sharon walks towards the car, she sees a van approaching and she holds up a hand to Robby and calls out... 
SHARON Two more minutes. 
And she walks toward the oncoming van, which is parking now. 
EXT. VAN - DAY 
The van is driven by KATHY, Sharon's brother's wife. Beside her in a car seat is LARRY, JR., four years old. Sharon comes to the rolled down window on the driver's side. She has a warm smile for Kathy and the child. Kathy smiles, too. 
KATHY Hi! Look -- it's your Auntie Sharon. 
SHARON Hey, Champ, my God, look how big. 
She has a special affection for the boy -- who is subdued, but he smiles a small one for his aunt. She takes one of his hands and they shake in mock formality. 
LARRY JR. Hi. 
SHARON Ow! You hurt my hand with that grip. Whew. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
She shakes her fingers, and he smiles a bit more. Sharon reaches in and rubs his head in a mock knuckling move. He laughs. She smooths his hair, affectionately. 
KATHY We're bringing Larry his lunch. Hey, it's good to see you. It's been awhile. What? 
Sharon is staring at Kathy's badly bruised ear. 
KATHY Oh, I went boom into a low shelf -- chasing after him of course. (nodding to the child) How're you doing? 
Sharon pulls her eyes off the bruise to meet Kathy's look -- and connect. 
SHARON I'm semi-okay. I heard about the... ceremony and the party. 
KATHY (embarrassed) Oh. I hope you'll be there. (pause) Really. 
Sharon smiles a bit, appreciating the support.       She pats Kathy's arm. 
SHARON Take it easy.    You too, Champ. 
The boy offers his little hand to shake again. 
SHARON Oh, no. You're not breaking my fingers again. 
They smile and drive on and Sharon walks toward her car and Robby. 
EXT. CITY PARK - DAY (NEXT DAY) 
We WATCH moms and kids and a basketball game in the park and PICK UP Catch walking by. Two pre-teens are playing bounce and catch with a rubber ball against a (tennis practice) wall, and one of them misses, and Catch makes a lunge and snags the ball. Instead of throwing it to one of the boys, he fires it at the wall. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
One of the boys catches it, bounces it off the wall toward Catch. Catch grabs it, and now he's part of this rapid-fire game -- and he's athletic and funny, too, playing hard and mugging and making them smile until... a POLICE CAR comes ROARING down the boulevard, slowing a bit to CHIRP its SIREN a few times -- clearing traffic. Catch glances up and sees... 
CATCH'S POV 
Sharon is in the car beside Robby. 
ON CATCH 
Stunned by the sight of her -- and he doesn't know why. He can't move, can't breathe, eyes fixed on her. The POLICE CAR pulls around a truck and ROARS on -- and that's when he is struck by a memory, a little like lightning. It comes as a quick -- 
FLASHBACK - EXT. FREEWAY - ACCIDENT SITE    - CATCH'S POV 
-- The man near death. Sharon is bending close to him, this all just a sliver of an image, and it jolts him. 
BACK TO SCENE (PRESENT) 
The police car is now converging with other squads just half a block away. Catch throws the ball back to the boys and runs toward the police incident. The boys watch him go, wondering. 
EXT. CLOSED STORE - DAY 
A police   car is parked askew near this closed store -- as now Robby   and Sharon's UNIT ROARS to a STOP beside it. Two cops   are calling and motioning to them, one holds a shotgun.    This is RAY JULIETTE.

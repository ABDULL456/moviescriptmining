MIKE You ate snake? 
JOSHUA When you're thirty klicks out from the nearest firebase. Humpin' through the wake-up with your finger on the trigger. Charlie doesn't give you time to stop for cutlet. 
As Mike skims his own net over the water, he glimpses a familiar barrel at the bottom of the pool. The brightly- colored biohazard warning label is clearly visible. 
EXT. ROAD - JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY 
Two bicycles are parked outside a cabin in the middle of nowhere. 
INT. JOSHUA'S HOUSE - DAY 
The decor is an odd mix of Vietnam era war relics and homegrown scientist. Charlie the Parrot sits on a perch. 
CHARLIE (V.O.) Charlie, don't surf! 
JOSHUA Quiet, bird.     We're working. 
Mike and Joshua stand near the spider tanks. A dozen aquariums on low shelves. Each glass tank replicates a specific environment: jungle, desert, cavern, pond, etc. 
JOSHUA (dims tank lights) The sun is going down, my nocturnal hunters. It's time to come out and feed. 
Mike watches Joshua deposit bugs into each spider tank. 
MIKE Yeah. They're definitely getting bigger. 
JOSHUA I've calculated a growth factor of twelve percent over the last forty-eight hours. But that seems to be accelerating. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MIKE All from eating these bugs?   Maybe I should try some. 
Mike pauses at the desert tank, watching a cricket search for food. A trap-door spider pops out of its camouflaged den like a jack-in-the-box. The arachnid yanks the cricket below and replaces the roof in a nanosecond. 
Mike looks in another tank where ogre-eyed spitting spiders shoot blasts of paralyzing goo at hapless insects. 
MIKE Run, little guys. 
JOSHUA They can't outrun the food chain. 
MIKE I could get away. 
JOSHUA Imagine yourself the size of that fly. A scytodes spitter would be as big as a Cadillac. You'd be spider chow, kid. 
Mike looks in a tank where jumpers chase fleeing crickets. He moves toward another tank that is covered with a towel. 
MIKE Are the new tarantulas in here? 
JOSHUA Took me forever to get a breeding set of Chilean reds. I must have bribed every customs agent from Vegas to Santiago. 
Joshua unveils the    tank. Dirt floor. Several burrow entrances. Joshua     pours in the bugs. A large, male tarantula comes out    of a burrow. It pounces on a bug, then wraps its prey    in webbing, turning the insect into a mummy-like bundle. 
MIKE That is too cool. 
JOSHUA Male tarantulas compete for the female's attention. (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JOSHUA (CONT'D) Each one tries to bring her the best present. Bugs, rats, even the occasional parrot. 
CHARLIE SQUAWKS. 
JOSHUA The prey is cocooned alive so she can eat them in her nest. You know how women love breakfast in bed. 
Joshua leads Mike to the back of the tank. A network of subterranean tunnels is revealed. The male tarantulas scuttle through carrying their mummified offerings. 
JOSHUA Take a look, the female of the species is three times as big as the male. 
Mike peers into a large den. The female tarantula steps out of the shadows. This is Consuela, the Chilean red tarantula. 
JOSHUA Say hello to Consuela. 
Mike watches Consuela unwrap one of the mummified bundles. She begins to eat the paralyzed insect within.

DONNY Get the two of them out of here. Jerry steps toward Amy, his face beginning to darken with rage, the MUSIC pulsating around them, people swirling by on all sides. 
JERRY She's mine -- Donny puts out his hand, stopping Jerry as the black bouncer drag's Charley and Amy toward the front door. 
DONNY You want chicken, man, you. go to some other club. Jerry snarls, his eyes beginning to glow, his hair slicking back slightly, the hint of fangs beginning to protrude over his upper lip as rage overtakes him. He raises his right hand, holding it out in.front of. the bouncer's face so the man can clearly see what is happening. The nails on the four fingers pop out, literally elongating several inches in front of the man's eyes, growing into razor sharp claws that sparkle in the overhead lights. The bouncer, terrified, screams for his'companion. 
'DONNY Hey, Leon, get back here! Toward the entrance to' the club, Leon releases Charley and Amy, hustling back toward his buddy. Charley grabs Amy,' pulling her toward the door. 
CHARLEY C'mon, quick -- But it's. too late already. Donny screams as the talons whistle through the air, tearing his throat out in one swipe, scattering blood everywhere, blinding several of the dancers swirling.by, hitting people drinking at the bar, a couple necking in a corner, blood flying everywhere. Jerry steps around the corpse as it topples backward over a table of coke users, the bouncer's dead eyes staring up at them. Leon dashes up, - lunging for Jerry. The vampire's hand snaps out, grabbing`him by the throat, squeezing, driving those claws deep into the man's neck, holding him like a chicken, enjoying a second of his death throes and then casually flinging him into the center of the floor, bringing the music and all the dancing to a shrieking halt as this new group of people stare at another dead body.

101 CONTINUED: ( 4) Pandemonium erupts throughout the club, people screaming and rushing for the exit, the fear contagious, all of them streaming toward the bottleneck of a hallway leading to the front door, turning it into a battleground of panicked, terrified people, clawing and screaming to get out of the club. - Close to the front door, Charley and Amy fight their way through the madness, trying to gain the outside and freedom as behind them a wave of panicked humanity sweeps toward them. 
CHARLEY Hold on to me -- Suddenly Jerry steps out in front of them and sweeps Amy away from. him, the crowd flowing around Charley and carry- ing him off in the opposite direction as he fights and screams to get back to her. 
CHARLEY 
AMYL But the sea of humanity is too much for him; it pushes him ,first away from and then toward the front door, leaving him no choice but to go with it or be trampled. 
102 EXT. CLUB RADIO - NIGHT 
Charley bursts through the entrance of the club just in time to see the black Jeep ROARING away down the street, Evil Ed peering out the back window, grinning wi.ldly at him, mocking him with his full set of fangs.

CHARLEY Dandrige has Amy. He says he'll kill her unless we come to his house. Peter stops, staring at Charley, stunned. The blood drains from his face. 
PETER Oh, my God.

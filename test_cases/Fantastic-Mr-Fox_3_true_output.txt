MRS. FOX You've got twenty-nine minutes to come up with a proper apology. Ash crosses his arms in front of his chest and stares straight ahead into space grimly. Fox says suddenly: 
FOX What's with the crazy outfit? Why a cape and the pants tucked into your socks? Ash does not respond. Fox sighs. Mrs. Fox finishes bandaging his tail. Fox goes over to the wall and stands with his back to the room. 
FOX I got fired slash quit the Gazette and started stealing chickens on the sly. 
MRS. FOX 
(ICILY) That tail was the first thing I ever noticed about you. It was easily the most attractive tail for at least 50 miles in every direction. It was probably your single best quality -- and now it's gone forever. 
CUT TO: Fox lying in bed staring at the ceiling in the dark next to Mrs. Fox. 
FOX Why the cuss didn't I listen my lawyer? At this point we'll be lucky if we can flip this tree for half of what we've already sunk into it. Fox flips over onto his stomach. 
FOX I won't be able to sleep on my back for six weeks -- and on my stomach I feel congested. Why the cuss didn't I listen to my lawyer? 
MRS. FOX 
(BITTERLY) Because you don't listen to anybody. 
FOX (sitting up suddenly) What was that? 
MRS. FOX 
(PAUSE) What? I said -- There is a quiet scraping sound from above. Fox jumps out of bed. He hollers: 
FOX Wake up! Everybody! They're digging us out! There is a scrunch and then a loud thump from above. Mrs. Fox looks at Fox intensely: 
MRS. FOX They'll kill the children! 
FOX 
(STEELY) Over my dead body, they will. 
MRS. FOX 
(ANGRILY) That's what I'm saying! You'd be dead, too, in that scenario! 
FOX 
(ANGRILY) Well, I'm arguing against that! 
MRS. FOX 
(SCREAMING) What are you talking about? 
FOX 
(SCREAMING) Why are you yelling at me?

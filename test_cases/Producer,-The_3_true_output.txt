THE PARACHUTE BEGINS TO ASCEND.  WE FOLLOW. 
BLOOM (coming out of it) Hey, we're going up. 
BIALYSTOCK You bet your boots, Leo.  It's Bialystock and Bloom -- on the rise. Upward and onward.  Say, you'll join me.  Nothing can stop us. 
BIALYSTOCK OFFERS HIS HAND TO BLOOM. 
BLOOM (shouting at the top of his lungs) I'll do it!  By God, I'll do it! 
BLOOM GRABS BIALYSTOCK'S HAND AND SHAKES IT FIRMLY. 
BIALYSTOCK This is where we belong, Leo.  On top of the world.  Top of the world! 
THEY HIT THE TOP.  THE PARACHUTE IS RELEASED, THEY QUICKLY PLUMMET DOWN. 
BIALYSTOCK Oiiiiiii!!! 
BLOOM Ohhhhhhhh!!! 
BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM DROP OUT OF FRAME. 
SLOW DISSOLVE TO BIALYSTOCK'S OFFICE.  NIGHT.  OVERHEAD SHOT. BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE BATHED IN A SMALL POOL OF CONCENTRATED LIGHT.  THEY ARE DOWN TO THEIR SHIRT SLEEVES. THEY ARE FEVERISHLY READING PLAY MANUSCRIPTS.  ALL ABOUT THEM ARE STREWN COFFEE CONTAINERS, SOME EMPTY, SOME HALF- FILLED.  THERE IS A HUGE PILE OF DISCARDED SCRIPTS ON THE FLOOR. 
CUT TO TIGHT SHOT OF LEO BLOOM AS HE READS SCRIPT.  HE LOOKS UP, PUSHES HIS GLASSES BACK AND MASSAGES THE BRIDGE OF HIS NOSE. 
BLOOM Max, let's call it a night.  It's two in the morning.  I don't know what I'm reading anymore. 
PULL BACK TO TWO SHOT. 
BIALYSTOCK Read, read.  We've got to find the worst play ever written. 
BIALYSTOCK TURNS HIS ATTENTION TO A NEW SCRIPT.  HE CRACKS IT OPEN AND BEGINS READING. 
BIALYSTOCK Hmmnn.  "Gregor Samsa awoke one morning to find he had been transformed into a giant cock-a- roach." 
IN A RAGE BIALYSTOCK FLINGS THE MANUSCRIPT ONTO THE PILE OF DISCARDS AS HE BELLOWS: 
BIALYSTOCK It's good!!! 
CAMERA MOVES UP AND WE DISSOLVE THROUGH TO MEDIUM SHOT OF OFFICE.  BIALYSTOCK AND BLOOM ARE THOROUGHLY DISHEVELED AND BADLY IN NEED OF A SHAVE. 
BLOOM (mumbling to himself as he reads) Wait a minute, I've read this part. I'm reading plays I read this morning. 
HE GETS UP, STRETCHES, GOES TO WINDOW AND RAISES SHADE. SUNLIGHT FLOODS THE ROOM.  HE REELS BACK AS THOUGH STRUCK. 
BLOOM Good lord, it's morning.  Let's face it, we'll never find it. (he turns to face Bialystock) Max, tomorrow's another day. Today's another day. 
BIALYSTOCK (off-camera.  Crazy little voice) We'll never find it, eh?  We'll never find it, eh?  Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha. 
CUT TO BIALYSTOCK.  HE IS STANDING.  AT HIS FEET LIES A SCRIPT.  HE DANCES AROUND IT, HIS ARMS FOLDED ACROSS HIS CHEST. 
BIALYSTOCK (as he does an insane little jig around the script) You can't smell it when it's under your nose.  You can't see it when it's right before your eyes. (MORE) 
BIALYSTOCK (CONT'D) You can't feel it when it's in your hand, when it's in your pocket. 
CUT TO MEDIUM SHOT. 
BLOOM Max, what is it?  What are you doing?  What's happening? 
BIALYSTOCK I'll tell you what's happening. We've struck gold.  Not fool's gold, but real gold.  The mother lode.  The mother lode.  The mother of them all.

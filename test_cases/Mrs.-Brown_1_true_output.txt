BROWN walks up to her side, opens the saddle bag and hands her a bundle of letters held together with ribbon. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) I cannot read them like that. 
BROWN undoes the ribbon and tries again.  VICTORIA cuts in. 
VICTORIA (CONT'D) You will hand them to me as I require. 
BROWN takes off the top letter and hands it to her. 
INT. OSBORNE HOUSE, UPPER SERVANT'S TABLE - NIGHT 
The clatter and crush of the Upper Servant's table as UPPER SERVANTS sit themselves down to dinner while UNDER SERVANTS prepare to serve soup. 
ARCHIE comes in and sits himself somewhere in the middle next to an empty seat.  A moment later, BROWN strides in. 
But instead of sitting at the place beside his brother, he goes straight to the head of the table and plonks himself down.  Slowly, the clatter dies away as the whole room stops and stares at him in silence.  BROWN fixes them with a look. 
An elderly butler steps into the room and stares in amazement at BROWN.  A smooth young man, BERTIE'S VALET, hurries up to intercede. 
BERTIE'S VALET Mr. Carter, the Head Butler, sits there. 
BROWN Not now he doesn't.  This is my place. 
BERTIE'S VALET By whose authority? 
BROWN My own. 
A little frisson of oh-my-gawdness.  BERTIE'S VALET stares icily at him. 
BERTIE'S VALET The order of seating at the Upper Servant's table is arranged personally by the Queen herself. 
BROWN That's a tautology lad. (unable to stop himself seriously explaining it) If you say the Queen arranges something, you've no need to say she's done it personally.  That's understood. 
But as far as BERTIE'S VALET is concerned, it isn't.  He stares down in mute fury, then snaps his fingers at one of the under servants, who rushes over.  There is a hurried exchange of whispers before the under servant rushes out. 
Unperturbed, BROWN brings out his flask and pours himself a substantial draft of whiskey.  He turns to the pretty assistant dresser, sitting to his right. 
BROWN (CONT'D) Are you dresser to Her Majesty? 
She blinks nervously at him. 
ASSISTANT DRESSER Assistant, sir, yes. 
BROWN tucks into his soup.  Everyone watches and waits. 
BROWN What's your name? 
ASSISTANT DRESSER Mary Taylor, sir. 
BROWN Have I seen you up in Balmoral, Mary? 
ASSISTANT DRESSER I hope to go up next year. 
BROWN You wouldn't happen to know what the Queen's reading for recreation, would you, Mary? 
The assistant dresser thinks for a moment. 
ASSISTANT DRESSER Lord Tennyson, sir?

Jeff drives, a determined expression. 
EXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - DAY 
The Jeep blows past. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. BELLE'S DINER - DAY 
A weather-beaten structure with a gravel parking lot.     A peeling sign on the roof: "Belle's: Beer & Food." There is a phone booth outside. 
The Cherokee pulls in and parks.      Jeff CHIRPS the ALARM, heads for the entrance. 
INT. BELLE'S - DAY 
Dark and dingy. Formica tables, a bar. Chunky customers in K-Mart clothes sit at the bar, nursing beers and watching a football game on a big MUTED TV. 
Jeff enters and all conversation stops. The other patrons turn and stare. After a moment, they return to their beers. 
Jeff glances around.   No sign of Amy.   No sign of Red. 
A bored-looking BARTENDER stands behind the counter, preparing a sandwich. Behind him, a blackboard menu. Jeff approaches. 
JEFF Excuse me. 
The Bartender looks up, a cutting knife in his hand. 
JEFF I was supposed to meet my wife here. 
The Bartender shrugs, gives him a look:    Yeah, so? 
JEFF Dark hair, slender, about five- five. Wearing a pale blue Benetton shirt. 
BARTENDER A pale blue what? 
JEFF Benetton shirt. 
The Bartender plops the sandwich on a plate, tears off an order slip. 
BARTENDER Hank!  Your order's ready. (to Jeff) I been busy. They come and go. 
JEFF It would've been within the last half hour. She might've been with a trucker? 
BARTENDER A trucker. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JEFF Guy with a baseball cap.   Driving an eighteen wheeler. 
The Bartender thinks a moment, shakes his head. 
BARTENDER Don't ring a bell. 
JEFF You sure? 
The Bartender leans over the counter, calls out: 
BARTENDER Hey! Man here's looking for his wife, dark hair, button-on shirt, travelin' with a guy in a baseball cap. Anybody see 'em? 
Jeff looks up and down the counter. Blank faces, a few disinterested shrugs, a few headshakes no. 
A disheveled female barfly, FLO, grins up at him. 
FLO Looks like she got away from ya, cowboy. 
A few of the regulars chuckle at this.     Jeff ignores them, turns back to the Bartender. 
JEFF Could she have left a message with another one of your employees? 
BARTENDER Don't see how. I'm the only one who works here. 
Jeff scratches his head.    This doesn't make any sense. 
JEFF I don't understand. Is there another Belle's Diner? 
BARTENDER (chuckles) No siree. Definitely not. 
Jeff clenches his jaw, takes another look around.      An elderly couple sit at a rear table, watching him.      They whisper to each other. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
JEFF (under his breath) Shit. 
He turns and goes outside... 
EXT. BELLE'S - DAY 
Jeff squints in the bright sunlight. 
Maybe he got this place confused with a different diner. He peers up at the sign. It says "Belle's," all right. 
He walks to the phone booth, looks inside.   The phone book is missing. 
He picks up the receiver, listens for the dial tone... Phone works okay. He hangs up.

ENTRANCE HALL -- SWANA'S APARTMENT 
Swana's maid is opening the door for Swana, who enters in the highest spirits. 
SWANA Good afternoon, Jacqueline. 
MAID Good afternoon, Your Highness. (hesitantly) Madame, I... 
SWANA You didn't find my glove. All right, you're forgiven. 
MAID Thank you, Your Highness. Count d'Algout is waiting. He's been here some time. 
Swana inspects herself briefly in the hall mirror, proceeds into the living room. 
LIVING ROOM -- SWANA'S APARTMENT 
Leon is pacing up and down. Swana enters. 
SWANA Leon, darling, how nice! Have you ordered tea or a cocktail? 
LEON No thanks, Swana. 
SWANA Did I act stupidly last night? Should I apologize? 
LEON I'm the one who should apologize. I should have talked to you before. 
SWANA Is this, by any chance, going to be a confession? 
LEON Yes. 
SWANA Oh, no, my little Volga boatman. Have you forgotten our First Commandment: Never Complain -- Never Explain. It has worked so often and so perfectly, don't let's break the rule. And please don't look so guilty, otherwise I'll... 
LEON This time, Swana -- just this once -- I must ask you to listen. 
SWANA All right, I'll listen. 
LEON I know you hate the obvious but do you mind if, at this moment, I'm not in the least subtle? 
SWANA Brutal frankness, if you insist. 
LEON There are a hundred ways to approach it, but I feel it can best be said in one simple phrase. I'm in love, Swana. 
SWANA And I thought it was something serious! How could you frighten me so? 
LEON It must be serious, Swana. Not long ago I'd have considered such a statement rather juvenile and rather middle class. Now I can say it without stammering, without a blush. I'm in love, Swana. 
SWANA Say it over and over again, Leon. Words are a wonderful safety valve, and that's what you need -- because you know it's impossible, don't you? 
LEON I have to be simple again, Swana, and you may find it shockingly banal. I've thought it over and I'm willing to take all the consequences, even if it means a complete readjustment of my way of living. 
SWANA Leon! This has the ugly sound of regeneration. 
LEON I'm afraid that's what it is. 
SWANA The same old trouble, Leon. You're always late. Whether you're taking me to the Opera or calling for me at a beauty shop, you're never on time. And now, when it's a question of your reform -- late again. (she glances at her wrist watch) By about five minutes. 
LEON What is this, Swana? 
SWANA Knowing the efficiency of the French Air Service I think I can guarantee that Madame Yakushova has already taken off for Moscow. 
LEON Has done what? 
SWANA She's gone, Leon. 
LEON Do you expect me to believe that? 
Swana picks up the receiver of the telephone and holds it out to him. 
SWANA Here's the telephone. If you call the hotel you will find that you have no seven o'clock appointment. 
THE MOSCOW PLANE 
It is flying past the Eiffel Tower. 
CLOSE SHOT -- AIRPLANE WINDOW 
Behind the window we see Ninotchka looking at Paris for the last time. Camera moves over to the next window and we see Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski also giving Paris a sad farewell look. 
ANOTHER VIEW OF PARIS, from the air. The mist has closed in by now so that only the top of the Eiffel Tower is visible above it. 
CLOSE-UP -- NINOTCHKA, looking down on the Tower 
INTERIOR, Airplane -- Ninotchka, Buljanoff, Iranoff, and Kopalski 
Ninotchka turns from the window and leans against the back of her chair. The Russians follow her example. There is a moment of silence and sadness. 
BULJANOFF Imagine, for once in our lives we were in Paris and we never went to the Eiffel Tower. 
KOPALSKI That's right.

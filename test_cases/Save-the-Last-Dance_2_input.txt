ROY Yeah? Well, when are you gonna have the guts to say what you really want to say to me, Sara?

SARA (screaming at him) Want me to say it? You were a piece of shit husband and you're a piece of shit father! You were never there for Mom or for me. You took off and never looked back. So don't talk to me about guts. 
Not quite the truth, but near enough to sting. It quiets Roy down. He regards her with regret and guilt. 
ROY Sounds like you have it all figured out. 
SARA I have you figured out. You think you can make up all the time you missed, all the things you didn't do? You can't! I'm here because I have to be and it's a goddamned nightmare. 
ROY Well, you might as well wake up and get used to it, Sara, because that's the way things are sometimes, the way life is. 
SARA How the hell would you know? You've been asleep for the past thirty-seven years! 
Now she does storm off. This time Roy lets her.     He can't find the words to deny what she's said. 
140   EXT. PATTERSON HIGH - QUAD OUTSIDE CAFETERIA - DAY             140 
A break between classes draws the requisite claques and cliques. Sara and Patrick huddle over a chemistry book, attentive to each other. Nikki stands off watching both of them. Malakai saunters up to her smoking a joint. Hazily indicates Patrick and Sara. 
MALAKAI The 'Love Boat.' 
NIKKI Love shit. That bitch is tap- dancin' on my last nerve.

MALAKAI Looks like she's tap-dancing on your last boyfriend. She got it like that? Naw. Never mind. Stall it. I ain't heard shit. 
NIKKI Stall what?   What you hear? 
MALAKAI Some trash she's talkin'.   About you. 
NIKKI About me? 
MALAKAI Yeah. How you ain't all 'at since Patrick's takin' her to the prom. (in for the kill) I am a little bit... chagrined though, Nikki. You lettin' some white ho' show you up like that. 
He regards her with bemused pity. Nikki, with all her inner outrage, manages to salvage her pride. She sneers in his face. 
NIKKI Fuck you, Malakai. Fuck her too. 
MALAKAI (gaily, a she sails off) Ain't no need in fuckin' me... stuck up, bitch... I'm on your side 
141   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - HALLWAY - DAY                             141 
Patrick drinks at a water fountain. Looks up. Malakai's standing there. There's still some tension between them. 
MALAKAI Yo. Me and the boyz fixin' to shoot some hoops. Us against Druid Hill. If you interested. 
PATRICK Druid Hill?   Hell yeah. 
MALAKAI Gotta skip last period.

141   CONTINUED:                                                   141 
PATRICK I got study hall. Don't matter anyway. Not with those suckers. I'll be back before the bell rings. 
They walk off together and, after a few steps, begin dribbling imaginary balls down the hall. 
142   INT. GYM (PATTERSON) - DAY                                   142 
A girls' basketball game in progress. Sara's playing defense. She's on Nikki's team. She blocks a shot but Chenille, on the opposing team, gets it on the rebound. Basket. Nikki shoots Sara a murderous look. Stupid, uncoordinated bitch. 
143   EXT. DRUID HILL PLAYGROUND - BASKETBALL COURT                143 
A four-on-four game in progress. Patrick, Malakai, Snookie and Arvel versus the Druid Hill Two Deuces. An unseen BOOM BOX BLASTS the music of JAY-Z throughout. Patrick has the ball. He passes it to Malakai. They AD- LIB insults to the Two Deuces. This is heaven for them. Talking shit and playing ball. The best time. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
144   INT. PATTERSON HIGH - GYM                                    144 
Sara takes her defensive position against an opposing player, successfully blocks the shot, tries to slam the ball to Nikki. It clips Nikki's head, bounces out of bounds. Nikki, her dignity stunned, her patience out, walks up to Sara, shoves her to the floor. Sara looks up at her as some disembodied voice calls out: 
FEMALE VOICE Don't start nothin', won't be nothin'! Stay down, girl! 
145   EXT. DRUID HILL - BASKETBALL COURT                           145 
Malakai dribbles the ball around one of the Two Deuces, skies it. Misses the hoop. Patrick rebounds. Passes it back to 'Kai. He takes the shot. Makes it. Patrick and Arvel strut victoriously.

HUDSON Nothing.  Zip. 
Apone stops, his expression changing.  They face a wall of living horror.  The colonists have been brought here and entombed alive... 
COCOONS protrude from the niches and interstices of the structure.  The cocoon material is the same translucent epoxy.  The bodies are frozen in carelessly twisted positions.  Macabre image of frozen agony.  Many are disiccated.  Skeletal. Rip-cages burst outward, as if exploded from within. Paralyzed, brought here, entombed in living death as hosts for the embryos growing within then. 
Dietrich moves close to examine one of the figures, perhaps the most "recent."  A WOMAN, ghost-white and drained.  The WOMAN'S EYES SNAP OPEN...They seem to plead. 
DIETRICH Sir! 
The woman's lips move feebly. 
WOMAN Please...God...kill me. 
INT. APC                                                 89 
Ripley watches the woman, white knuckled.  The sound of RETCHING comes over the general frequency. 
INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      90 
The woman begins to convulse.  She SCREAMS, a sawing shriek of mindless agony. 
APONE Flame thrower!  Move! 
Frost hands it to him.  Suddenly, the woman's chest EXPLODES in a gout of blood.  A SMALL FANGED HEAD EMERGES, HISSING VICIOUSLY. 
Apone pulls the trigger.  Then the other troopers carrying flame throwers open fire.  An orgy of purging fire.  The cocoons vanish in the shimmering heat. 
A SHRILL SCREECHING begins, like a siren made from fingernails on blackboards. 
ANGLE ON WALL  as something begins to emerge.  Dimly glimpsed, a glistening bio-mechanoid creature larger then a man.  Lying dormant, it had blended perfectly with the convoluted surface of fused bone.  The troopers don't see it.  Smoke from the burning cocoons quickly fills the confined space.  Visibility drops to zero. 
HUDSON Movement! 
APONE Position? 
HUDSON Can't lock up... 
APONE (with an edge) Talk to me, Hudson. 
HUDSON Uh, seems to be in front and behind. 
INT. APC                                                 91 
Gorman is plating with the gain controls on the monitors. 
GORMAN We can't see anything back here, Apone.  What's going on? 
Ripley senses it coming, like a wave at night.  Dark, terrifying and inevitable. 
RIPLEY (low) Pull you team out, Gorman. 
INT. COCOON CHAMBER - TIGHT ON SEVERAL WALLS AND         92 CEILING NICHES 
as they come alive.  Bonelike, tubelike shapes shift, becoming emerging ALIENS.  Dimly glimpsed...glints of slime.  Silhouettes. 
APONE Go to infrared.  Looks sharp people! 
The squad members snap down their image-intersifier visors. 
HUDSON Multiple signals.  All round. Closing. 
Dietrich turns to retreat, her flamethrower held tightly.  A nightmarish silhouette materializes out of the smoke behind her!  It strikes like lightning. SEIZES HER.  She fires reflexively, wild.  The jet of flame engulfs Frost nearby. 
Apone spins as the double SCREAM.  Can't see anything in the think smoke. 
INT. APC                                                 93 
Ripley watches Frost's monitor go black.  His bio-readouts flatten.  The other screens show glimpses of shimmering infrared silhouettes of the aliens, the images bobbing and panning confusedly. 
INT. COCOON CHAMBER                                      94 
Vasquez nods to Drake with grim satisfaction. 
VASQUEZ Let's rock. 
They OPEN UP simultaneously, lighting up the smoke like welders' arcs. 
GORMAN (voice over; static) Who's firing?  I ordered a hold fire, dammit!

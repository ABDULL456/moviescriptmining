Emma, knowing her husband's ambivalence towards religion, casts him a slightly arch, amused look. Innes notices this, though he pretends not to. 
Hooker returns from the river, looking slightly damp, with the rod which he has managed to retrieve 
HOOKER Everyone's a bit wet. Sorry, but the fish are surely biting. More worms, boys, more worms. 
George is looking under stones 
HOOKER Try over there, Georgey, we've used all these ones up. 
They move off, joining Annie and the other in their hunt for crawling things. The air above them is heavy and sparkling with pollen. 
21   EXT. OCEAN. NIGHT                                            21 
A sailing ship sails past, trailing phosphorescence it its wake. 
DARWIN (V.O.) On the Beagle, quite, often we would drop a flask in the ocean and find it teeming with living particles which glowed in the night 
22   INT. SHIP'S CABIN. NIGHT                                     22 
The figure in silhouette of young Darwin inspects a flask of sea water, glowing in the darkness. 
He takes a few drops on a watch glass and places them on the illuminated stage of his microscope. 
Under the microscope, against a black background, millions of tiny swimming animals. 
23   EXT. BY THE RIVER BANK. THE PAST. DAY                        23 
Cut to the air above the picnickers - alive with glittering particles - against the dark trees behind. 
DARWIN ....so much beauty for so little purpose. 
EMMA Surely not without purpose. They were helping to light the ship's way were they not. 
Darwin smiles at the idea, turns to Innes 
DARWIN Are you familiar with the works of Thomas Malthus, Mr Innes?. 
INNES He married his first cousin didn't he? 
EMMA So did Charles.... So did I. 
INNES Oh, I was not at all suggesting.... 
Emma waves it away. Just teasing 
DARWIN He made the point that if every trout, say, has a hundred offspring And so on and so on through the generations. Then the planet would be knee deep in trout in just a few decades. 
INNES Of course most of the eggs are destroyed and eaten so the numbers remain stable. That is the beauty of God's plan. 
Emma gives Darwin a "So there" look and hands Innes a sandwich. 
EMMA Cheese and cucumber 
INNES Thank-you 
Somewhere in the woods, Annie has found a treasure trove of worms and slugs. 
ANNIE (O.S. DISTANT) Over here ....there are millions! 
DARWIN It doesn't strike you as an exceedingly wasteful plan - these myriad lives created only to be immediately extinguished. 
EMMA (a gentle warning) Charles.... 
INNES (confidently) They are providing food for others. 
DARWIN You think they are happy about it? 
INNES Happy? 
Close up on a writing worm. Hooker is instructing George how to put a worm on a hook. 
HOOKER Through his bottom and up though his mouth - perfect

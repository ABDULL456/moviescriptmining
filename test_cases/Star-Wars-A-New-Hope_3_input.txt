THREEPIO Don't shoot! Don't shoot! Will this never end? 
EXT. TATOOINE - DESERT - LARS HOMESTEAD - AFTERNOON 
The Jawas mutter gibberish as they busily line up their battered captives, including Artoo and Threepio, in front of the enormous Sandcrawler, which is parked beside a small homestead consisting of three large holes in the ground surrounded by several tall moisture vaporators and one small adobe block house. 
The Jawas scurry around fussing over the robots, straightening them up or brushing some dust from a dented metallic elbow. The shrouded little creatures smell horribly, attracting small insects to the dark areas when their mouths and nostrils should be. 
Out of the shadows of a dingy side-building limps Owen Lars, a large burly man in his mid-fifties. His reddish eyes are sunken in a dust-covered face. As the farmer carefully inspects each robot, he is closely followed by his slump- shouldered nephew, Luke Skywalker. One of the vile little Jawas walks ahead of the farmer spouting an animated sales pitch in a queer, unintelligible language. 
A voice calls out from one of the huge holes that form the homestead. Luke goes over to the edge and sees his Aunt Beru standing in the main courtyard. 
BERU Luke, tell Owen that if he gets a translator to be sure it speaks Bocce. 
LUKE It looks like we don't have much of a choice but I'll remind him. 
Luke returns to his uncle as they look over the equipment for sale with the Jawa leader. 
OWEN I have no need for a protocol droid. 
THREEPIO (quickly) Sir -- not in an environment such as this -- that's why I've also been programmed for over thirty secondary functions that... 
OWEN What I really need is a droid that understands the binary language of moisture vaporators. 
THREEPIO Vaporators! Sir -- My first job was programming binary load lifter... very similar to your vaporators. You could say... 
OWEN Do you speak Bocce? 
THREEPIO Of course I can, sir. It's like a second language for me... I'm as fluent in Bocce... 
OWEN All right shut up! (turning to Jawa) I'll take this one. 
THREEPIO Shutting up, sir. 
OWEN Luke, take these two over to the garage, will you? I want you to have both of them cleaned up before dinner. 
LUKE But I was going into Toshi Station to pick up some power converters... 
OWEN You can waste time with your friends when your chores are done. Now come on, get to it! 
LUKE All right, come on! And the red one, come on. Well, come on, Red, let's go. 
As the Jawas start to lead the three remaining robots back into the Sandcrawler, Artoo lets out a pathetic little beep and starts after his old friend Threepio. He is restrained by a slimy Jawa, who zaps him with a control box. 
Owen is negotiating with the head Jawa. Luke and the two robots start off for the garage when a plate pops off the head of the red astro-droid's head plate and it sparks wildly. 
LUKE Uncle Owen... 
OWEN Yeah? 
LUKE This R2 unit has a bad motivator. Look! 
OWEN (to the head Jawa) Hey, what're you trying to push on us? 
The Jawa goes into a loud spiel. Meanwhile, Artoo has sneaked out of line and is moving up and down trying to attract attention. He lets out with a low whistle. Threepio taps Luke on the shoulder. 
THREEPIO (pointing to Artoo) Excuse me, sir, but that R2 unit is in prime condition. A real bargain. 
LUKE Uncle Owen... 
OWEN Yeah? 
LUKE What about that one? 
OWEN (to Jawa) What about that blue one? We'll take that one. 
With a little reluctance the scruffy dwarf trades the damaged astro-droid for Artoo. 
LUKE Yeah, take it away. 
THREEPIO Uh, I'm quite sure you'll be very pleased with that one, sir. He really is in first-class condition. I've worked with him before. Here he comes. 
Owen pays off the whining Jawa as Luke and the two robots trudge off toward a grimy homestead entry. 
LUKE Okay, let's go. 
THREEPIO (to Artoo) Now, don't you forget this! Why I should stick my neck out for you is quite beyond my capacity! 
INT. LARS HOMESTEAD - GARAGE AREA - LATE AFTERNOON 
The garage is cluttered and worn, but a friendly peaceful atmosphere permeates the low grey chamber. Threepio lowers himself into a large tub filled with warm oil. Near the battered Landspeeder little Artoo rests on a large battery with a cord to his face. 
THREEPIO Thank the maker! This oil bath is going to feel so good. I've got such a bad case of dust contamination, I can barely move! 
Artoo beeps a muffled reply. Luke seems to be lost in thought as he runs his hand over the damaged fin of a small two-man Skyhopper spaceship resting in a low hangar off the garage. Finally Luke's frustrations get the better of him and he slams a wrench across the workbench. 
LUKE It just isn't fair. Oh, Biggs is right. I'm never gonna get out of here! 
THREEPIO Is there anything I might do to help? 
Luke glances at the battered robot. A bit of his anger drains and a tiny smile creeps across his face. 
LUKE Well, not unless you can alter time, speed up the harvest, or teleport me off this rock! 
THREEPIO I don't think so, sir. I'm only a droid and not very knowledgeable about such things. Not on this planet, anyways. As a matter of fact, I'm not even sure which planet I'm on. 
LUKE Well, if there's a bright center to the universe, you're on the planet that it's farthest from. 
THREEPIO I see, sir. 
LUKE Uh, you can call me Luke. 
THREEPIO I see, sir Luke. 
LUKE (laughing) Just Luke. 
THREEPIO And I am See-Threepio, human-cyborg relations, and this is my counterpart, Artoo-Detoo. 
LUKE Hello. 
Artoo beeps in response. Luke unplugs Artoo and begins to scrape several connectors on the robot's head with a chrome pick. Threepio climbs out of the oil tub and begins wiping oil from his bronze body. 
LUKE You got a lot of carbon scoring here. It looks like you boys have seen a lot of action.

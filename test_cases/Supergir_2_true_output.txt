THE CAMERA PANS over to reveal Ethan standing beside the huge fairground switch boxes, turning on the lights. Supergirl stands beside him. 
ETHAN This is my favourite place in the city. 
SUPERGIRL Are you sure it's all right for us to be here? 
ETHAN They don't care, they're tearing it down for a shopping centre. 
He flips the last switch, which starts the Ferris wheel revolving slowly, like a great spiral galaxy in space. Soft music plays. 
ETHAN Like it? 
SUPERGIRL Yes. It reminds me of home. 
ETHAN Where Superman's from? Krypton? 
SUPERGIRL No. Argo City. It was on a chunk of rock that was part of Krypton once---but we moved it to inner space. 
ETHAN I'm sorry, I don't understand. 
SUPERGIRL It's not important. The important thing is I'm here to find something and I think you can he1p me. 
ETHAN Come on, let's ride. 
They walk to the slowly revolving Ferris wheel and hop aboard one of the gondola cars. 
ETHAN I used to work here summers when I was a kid. SUPERGIRL Ethan, tell me more about this woman who's after you. 
ETHAN Let's talk about us, not her. 
SUPERGIRL Tell me where I can find her. 
ETHAN I don't want you to go near her. She's bad news. 
Ethan puts his arm around her shoulders, casually, no big deal. 
SUPERGIRL But be reasonable. If I don't do something to stop her she'll try again. And maybe hurt you. 
ETHAN I'll be safe with you. We can stay together the rest of our lives. 
SUPERGIRL We can't do that. 
ETHAN Why not ? 
SUPERGIRL We're from different worlds. 
ETHAN Just give me a chance to show how much I love you. Love changes everything. Love makes everything possib1e. 
EXT. ENTRANCE TO AMUSEMENT PARK. NIGHT 
Selena gets out of her Cadillac and walks to the chained and locked gate. A big sign says KEEP OUT. CONDEMMED PROPERTY. FUTURE SITE OF FUNFAIR MALL SHOPPING PLAZA. She mutters something under her breath and the chains fall away, the locks click open, and the gate glides noiselessly ajar. Se1ena strides in imperiously. 
EXT. TOP OF FERRIS WHEEL 
SUPERGIRL All this talk about love, it's silly. 
ETHAN You don't like me? You hate me? 
There is such a look of tragedy on Ethan's face, that Supergirl is afraid he might instantly fling himself to his death if she said yes. 
SUPERGIRL Of Course I don't hate you. I  don't hate anyone. 
ETHAN What do you feel about me? 
SUPERGIRL I...I don't know. This is all so sudden. 
THE CAMERA RACKS FOCUS FOR A MOMENT TO DISCOVER : 
Selena, lurking.be1ow them in the shadows of the Spine Snapper Ride. 
ETHAN There's one sure way to find out how you feel. 
SUPERGIRL What's that? 
ETHAN Let me kiss you. 
SUPERGIRL No.

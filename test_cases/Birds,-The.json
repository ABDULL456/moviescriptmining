{"train": "\"THE BIRDS\" - by Evan Hunter - 2nd Revision \n\"THE BIRDS\" \nby \nEvan Hunter \nBased on the novel \"Birds\" \nBy \nDaphne Du Maurier \nFINAL DRAFT 2nd Revision March 2, 1962 \nFADE IN: \nFULL SHOT - GRANT STREET - SAN FRANCISCO - DAY \nIt is mid-afternoon, and there is a tempo and pace to the people walking, the doorman HOOTING for taxicabs, the policemen directing traffic. \nPAN SHOT - PEDESTRIANS \nwaiting at street corner for light to change. \nCLOSE SHOT - MAN \nat the end of line of pedestrians. He is looking up at the sky. \nTWO SHOT - MAN AND WOMAN NEXT TO HIM \nas she follows his gaze upward. \nLONG SHOT - THE SKY \nwith hundreds of gulls in it, wheeling. \nMED. SHOT - THE STREET CORNER \nas the light changes and people begin to cross. In the crowd walking the other way, a man turns to look up at the wheeling gulls in the sky overhead. The CAMERA LOCATES: \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE DANIELS \nin the crowd of pedestrians, approaching Davidson's Pet Shop. She is a young woman in her mid-twenties, sleekly groomed, exquisitely dressed, though hatless. She walks with the quick sureness of the city dweller, a purposefulness in her stride, a mischievous grin on her face. She continues toward the front door of a pet shop and enters. \nINT. BIRD SHOP - MED. SHOT \nMelanie opens the door and comes through, still looking back toward the street and skywards. The proprietor, a MRS. MacGRUDER, comes toward her. \nMELANIE Hello, Mrs. MacGruder, have you ever seen so many gulls? \nMRS. MACGRUDER Hello, Miss Daniels. \nMELANIE What do you suppose it is? \nMED. SHOT \nMrs. MacGruder takes a look out at the sky. A puppy is BARKING, o.s. \nMRS. MACGRUDER (shaking her head) There must be a storm at sea. That can drive them inland, you know. \nThey are climbing the short flight of steps into the bird department now. The BARKING of the dog SEGUES into the clamor of innumerable birds, TWEETING, TWITTERING, CAWING as Melanie and Mrs. MacGruder go to the counter at the far end.  There is a circular cage in the center of the room, and the walls are lined with wire-mesh cages and smaller wooden cages so that the effect is one of being surrounded by birds, contained birds to be sure. The birds are quite beautiful, mostly exotic birds, small splashes of color behind the wire-mesh cages, larger bursts of brilliant hue on the parrots and parakeets in the bigger cages. As they walk: \nMRS. MACGRUDER I was hoping you'd be a little late, Miss Daniels. (apologetically) You see, he hasn't arrived yet. \nMELANIE You said three o'clock. \nMRS. MACGRUDER I know. Oh, I know. (she is more distressed now) I've been calling all morning. Oh, you have no idea. Miss Daniels, they're so difficult to get, really they are. We get them from India, you know, when they're just little chicks, and then we have to... \nMELANIE Well, this one won't be a chick, will he? \nMRS. MACGRUDER Certainly not. Oh, no. Certainly not. This will be a full grown myna bird. Full grown. \nMELANIE And he'll talk? \nMRS. MACGRUDER Well, yes, he'll talk. Well, no, no. You'll have to teach him to talk. \nMELANIE Yes. \nMRS. MACGRUDER Yes. (pause) Oh my, I suppose I should call them again. They said three o'clock. (pause) Maybe it's the traffic. I'll call. Would you mind waiting? \nMELANIE (judiciously) I think maybe you'd better deliver him. Let me give you my address. (she begins taking off her gloves) \nMRS. MACGRUDER (producing pencil and pad) Oh. Oh, well, all right. \nAs Melanie starts writing: \nMRS. MACGRUDER I'm sure they're on the way, though. Could I just call? \nMELANIE (with a resigned sigh) Well, all right, but... \nShe scurries out behind the counter and out of sight.  Melanie finishes writing her address and stands impatiently by the counter. She taps her teeth with the pencil. \nMRS. MACGRUDER (O.S.) Hello, this is Betty MacGruder at Davidson's. (pause; accusingly) It's past three, you know. (pause) Well, how long do you think...? All right, would you check it please? Yes, I'll wait. \nMelanie sighs. Leaving her gloves and purse on the counter, she begins wandering around the shop, still tapping her lips with the pencil. There is no menace in the birds surrounding her. They are active and beautiful as they dart behind the bars and mesh of their cages. Off screen, the puppy begins BARKING again as the front door opens. Melanie looks up. \nMED. SHOT - MITCH BRENNER \nas he closes the entrance door behind him and starts up the steps to the bird department. He is a handsome man, about twenty-nine or thirty, well-dressed, and carrying a felt hat. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nseeing him, and then turning away to bend before the cage of strawberry finches. She pokes the pencil through the mesh. The birds are startled into scarlet flight. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nas they pass each other in the aisle. He gives a polite little nod, and she gives a polite little smile. But as he passes her, and unknown to her, he turns for a second look -- and then vanishes behind the circular cage as he turns he corner. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nlooking at her watch as she wanders around the other side of the cage and then comes face to face with Mitch again. \nMITCH I wonder if you could help me. \nMELANIE What? \nMITCH (deliberately, and with a touch of hauteur) I said I wonder if you could help me. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \na trifle annoyed by his manner at first. She is about to inform him, if you please, that she is not a shopgirl. But then something rebellious flashes in her eyes and an idea comes to her. \nMELANIE (solicitously) Yes, what was it you were looking for, sir? \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nMITCH (deadpan) Lovebirds. \nMELANIE Lovebirds, sir? \nMITCH Yes. I understand there are different varieties, it that true? \nMITCH I simply believe in the law, Miss Daniels, and I'm not too keen on practical jokers. \nMELANIE What do you call your lovebird story if not a practical... \nMITCH Ahhh, but I really do want those birds. \nMELANIE You knew I didn't work here. You deliberately... \nMITCH Right. I recognized you when I came in. I thought you might like to know what it felt like to be on the other end of a gag. What do you think of that, Miss Daniels? \nMELANIE I think you're a louse. \nMITCH I am. (he tips his hat) Good day. (to Mrs. MacGruder) Madam. (and he goes down the steps) \nMELANIE And I'm glad you didn't get your lovebirds! \nMITCH (breezily, as he goes out) I'll find something else. (he gives a slight bow) See you in court some day. \nThe door closes. The puppy begins BARKING. \nMELANIE (angrily) That... that... who was that? \nMRS. MACGRUDER I have no idea. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nseething as she stares after him. Suddenly, she gets an idea. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \ngoing down the steps and to the front door of the shop. She looks through the glass. \nLONG SHOT - MITCH - MELANIE'S P.O.V. \ngetting into his car at the curb. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nlooking after the car at the curb. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE LICENSE PLATE CLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nseeing the plate, giving a brief, determined, angry nod. She begins to repeat the numbers to herself as she turns. \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE \nas she comes up the steps again and walks toward the counter. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE - MRS. MACGRUDER'S P.O.V. \nas she comes up to the counter. \nMELANIE Have you got a pencil? \nMRS. MACGRUDER What? Oh, yes, certainly. \nAs Melanie begins writing: \nMRS. MACGRUDER They said the myna bird would be here later this afternoon. If you'd care to come back... \nMELANIE No, you'd better send him. May I use your phone? \nMRS. MACGRUDER (bewildered by everything) Yes, certainly. (she puts phone on counter) \nMELANIE (as she dials) Do you have any lovebirds? \nMRS. MACGRUDER No, not in the shop. But I can order them for you. \nMELANIE How soon? \nMRS. MACGRUDER Well... well, how soon would you want them? \nMELANIE Immediately. (into phone) Is this the Daily News? Melanie Daniels. Would you get me the city desk, please? \nMRS. MACGRUDER I might be able to have them by tomorrow morning. Would that be all right? \nMELANIE (with an edged anger) That would be just fine. (into phone) Hello, Charlie, this is Melanie. I want you to do a favor for me. (pause) No, this is a small one. (pause) Pressure you? Why, Charlie darling, would I try to pressure you?  Will you call the Department of Motor Vehicles for me and find out who owns this license plate? DKQ dash one seven six. (pause) Yes, a California plate. (pause) No, I'll stop up there in a little while. Is daddy in his office? (pause) Oh. No, no, I don't want to break in on a meeting. Just tell him I'll see him later. Thank you, Charlie. (she hangs up) \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE ICY DETERMINATION ON HER FACE. \nMELANIE Now. What time tomorrow morning? \nFADE IN: \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE'S SPORTS CAR \npulling up in front of Mitch's building, the top down. She glances up at the address, gets out of the car, comes around to the other side, and opens the door. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE LOVEBIRDS \nin a cage as Melanie reaches for them. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nturning from the car and going into the building. She pauses in the lobby, studies the names alongside the bell buttons. \nCLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND \nrunning down the list of names slowly. It stops. \nINSERT - THE CARD \nher finger beside it. \nBRENNER, M. 3B \nCLOSE SHOT - HER GLOVED HAND the forefinger extended as she runs it down over every bell button in one column, and then does the same for the next column. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nas she turns from the bells to the inner door of the lobby, grabbing the knob. A BUZZ SOUNDS. She opens the door. \nREVERSE SHOT - MELANIE \ncoming through the door and into the lobby. She walks swiftly toward the elevator where a well-dressed man is standing, waiting. Behind her, the inner door is BUZZING wildly with answering BUZZES. Melanie and the man stand waiting for the elevator, silently. Behind her, the BUZZING STOPS. The elevator doors open. The man smiles pleasantly and allows her to enter first. She does so with a small nod.  The elevator doors close. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE MAN - IN THE ELEVATOR \nThe birds are CHIRPING wildly in their cage. The man and Melanie stand silently side by side. The man's eyes wander down to the bird-cage. Melanie's eyes move toward him.  Self- consciously, she stands with the cage of CHATTERING birds. The man is dead-panned, unsmiling. The elevator stops. The doors begin to open. \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE \nstepping out of the elevator as the doors open. The man is right behind her. She begins looking for apartment 3B. The man is walking down the corridor beside her. She stops in front of the apartment, hesitates, hoping the man will turn the corner in the corridor. Instead, he stops at the apartment just opposite. He begins fumbling in his pocket for his key. He looks at Melanie. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nsmiling at him feebly. \nFULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR \nThe man spread change and an assortment of junk on the palm of his hand as he searches for his key. Impatiently, Melanie watches him. Making a decision, she puts the birdcage down before the door to apartment 3B, and then opens her purse. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE'S GLOVED HAND \nFULL SHOT - THE CAR \npulling in, in front of the post office. Melanie opens the door and steps out. She is smartly dressed in a traveling suit and sweater. She looks up at the sign, and then walks quickly toward the front door. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nenters post office. \nCLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK \nbehind cage as Melanie approaches it. He is busy filling out a form of some kind, affixing stamps to it, etc. He does not look up as she approaches. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nthrough the bars of the cage. \nMELANIE Good morning. \nCLOSE SHOT - POSTAL CLERK \nCLERK (without looking up) Morning. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK \nMELANIE I wonder if you could help me. \nCLERK Try my best. \nMELANIE I'm looking for a man named Mitchell Brenner. \nCLERK Yep. \nHe is still busy with his form, still does not look up. \nMELANIE Do you know him? \nCLERK Yep. \nMELANIE Where does he live? \nCLERK Right here. Bodega Bay. \nMELANIE Yes, but where? \nCLERK Right across the bay there. \nMELANIE Where? \nIt seems as if the Clerk will not answer her. Suddenly, he leaves the window. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nthrough the bars, exasperated. \nREVERSE SHOT - FULL - MELANIE \nas she tries to peek through the bars to see where he's vanished. A door to the left of the window opens, and the Clerk steps out. He walks a little distance as Melanie watches him, then stops, turns and looks at her surprised, as if he'd expected her to be right behind him. He stands stock still, looking at her, saying nothing. She understands then that he wants her to follow him, and she catches up, neither speaking. They go to the front door. He opens it, looks at her, then looks out across the town and the bay. He extends his arm and points. \nCLERK See where I'm pointing? \nMELANIE Yes? \nFULL SHOT - THE BAY - THEIR P.O.V. - (MATTE) \nCLERK (O.S.) See them two big trees across there? \nMELANIE (O.S.) Yes? \nCLERK (O.S.) And the white house? \nMELANIE (O.S.) That's where the Brenners live. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND THE CLERK \nMELANIE The Brenners? Mr. and Mrs. Brenner? \nCLERK Nope, just Lydia and the two kids. \nMELANIE The two kids? \nCLERK Yep. Mitch and the little girl. \nMELANIE I see. How do I get down there? \nCLERK Follow the road straight through town 'til it curves off on the left. That'll take you right around the bay to their front door. \nMELANIE The front door. (pause) Isn't there a back road I can take? \nCLERK Nope. That's the road. Straight through town, stay on your left, right around the bay to the front door. \nMELANIE You see, I wanted to surprise them. \nCLERK Mmmm. \nMELANIE I didn't want to come right down the road, where they could see me. \nCLERK Mmmm. \nMELANIE It's a surprise, you see. \nCLERK Mmmmmm. (long pause) 'Course, you could get yourself a boat, cut right across the bay with it. The Brenners got a little dock there you could tie up at. If that's what you wanted to do. \nMELANIE Where would I get a boat? \nCLERK Down at the dock by the Tides Restaurant. Ever handled an outboard boat? \nMELANIE (looking at him) Of course. \nCLERK (looks back at her) D'you want me to order one for you? \nMELANIE (surprised) Thank you. \nCLERK What name? \nMELANIE Daniels. \nCLERK Okay. \nHe nods briefly and goes inside. Melanie looks across the bay. \nFULL SHOT - THE BAY - MELANIE'S P.O.V. - (MATTE) \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nsmiling. She gets a new idea. She reaches into her purse for the envelope. She looks at the envelope, then tears it up and stuffs the torn envelope into her handbag. She turns back toward the post office. \nINT. THE POST OFFICE - FULL SHOT \nas Melanie approaches the Clerk's window. He is still busy, still does not look up. \nMELANIE I wonder if you could tell me... \nCLERK Yep? \nANNIE You're leaving after you see Cathy? \nMELANIE Well... something like that. (pause) I'm sorry. I don't mean to sound so mysterious. \nANNIE Actually, it's none of my business. \nThere is a pause. Melanie, by her silence, affirms that it is none of Annie's business. \nANNIE (putting out cigarette) I'd better get on my way. Thank you very much. \nANNIE Not at all. \nThey begin walking toward the car. \nANNIE (still curious) Did you drive up from San Francisco? \nMELANIE Yes. \nANNIE It's a nice drive. (pause) Is that where you met Mitch? \nMELANIE (hesitating, then) Yes. \nANNIE I guess that's where everyone meets him. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nas she gets in behind the wheel. Annie's remark is not lost on her, and a quick look of sudden understanding crosses her face. \nMELANIE Now you sound a bit mysterious, Miss Hayworth. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE \nas Annie leans over the seat. \nANNIE Do I? (she shakes her head, smiles wistfully) No, I'm an open book, I'm afraid. (pause) Or maybe a closed one. (she smiles again, sees the lovebirds) Pretty. What are they? \nMELANIE Lovebirds. \nTaking this as a further indication of Melanie's relationship with Mitch: \nANNIE Mmm. (pause) Well, good luck, Miss Daniels. \nMELANIE Thank you. \nShe nods pleasantly, starts the car, pulls away. \nCLOSE SHOT - ANNIE \nwatching the car, a look of sad resignation on her face. \nDISSOLVE \nMED.

She opens her purse and reaches in for the paper bag. \nCLOSE SHOT - HER HANDS \nShe pulls out a birthday card from the paper bag. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nreaching into her purse again for a fountain pen. She unscrews the cap, braces the card on her closed purse. \nINSERT - THE CARD \nHappy Birthday, the usual rhyming sentiments. The pen writes: To Cathy \nDISSOLVE \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE'S CAR \ncrossing the highway down into the parking area behind the Tides, close to the docks. \nHIGH SHOT \nShe gets out of the car and walks onto one of the docks, the bird cage in her hand. Melanie approaches a waiting fisherman. She asks for her boat. The fisherman nods. He leads her to the dock and the waiting boat.  She gets into the outboard motorboat, the fisherman helping her. He hands down the lovebirds in their cage. \nFULL SHOT - THE BOAT \npulling away from the dock, heading across the bay. \nVERY LONG SHOT (MATTE) - THE BOAT \nand the wide expanse of the bay, as it heads on a direct course for the house on the other side. \nVERY LONG SHOT (MATTE) \nAnother spectacular SHOT of the small boat. \nFULL SHOT - THE BOAT \ncoming head-on toward CAMERA, Melanie at the tiller. She cuts the motor. The motor drifts to a stop. The bay is silent except for the cry of the gulls. \nLONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE - MELANIE'S P.O.V. \nThere is not a sign of activity as the boat drifts just a little closer. As Melanie watches, the front door opens and a woman comes out, walks to a red pickup truck, starts the engine. A little girl comes out of the house, goes to the truck, gets in. The woman shouts something to a man -- Mitch Brenner, probably, though it is difficult to tell from this distance -- and he comes over to the truck. \nThe truck grinds into gear, goes around the turnabout, and heads down the road away from the farm, a huge cloud of dust behind it. The farm is still again. Mitch stands looking after the truck for a moment, and then begins walking up toward the barn in the distance. \nCLOSE SHOT \nwatching, biting her lip. \nLONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE \nMitch reaching the barn and entering. Silence. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nwatching, waiting. \nLONG SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE \nNot a sign of life. \nMED.

The boat drifts in. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nleaping ashore, tying up the boat, reaching down for the cage. She climbs onto the dock and approaches the CAMERA until she is in WAIST SHOT. The CAMERA STARTS to RECEDE in front of her as she walks forward. \nTHE CAMERA MOVING TOWARD THE HOUSE AND BARN \nThe barn door closed, still no sign of Mitch. \nWAIST SHOT - MELANIE \nLONG SHOT - THE DOCK - MELANIE'S MOVING P.O.V. \nmoves forward slower. Mitch drives onto dock, gets out of the car and stands waiting. \nCLOSE SHOT - STRAIGHT BACK - MELANIE (PROCESS) \npartially posing for Mitch, her hair blowing in the wind, her head tilted back, a smile on her face. \nFULL SHOT - GULL \nswooping down from UPPER LEFTHAND CORNER OF FRAME TO LOWER RIGHT.  CLOSE SHOT - STRAIGHT BACK - MELANIE (PROCESS) \nas gull strikes the back of her head. She recoils and looks up with shock and pain. \nGULL - MELANIE'S P.O.V. \nThe gull soars away from LOWER RIGHTHAND corner of frame to UPPER LEFT. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nreacting to the sudden attack and looking after receding gull.

She seems dazed. She shakes her head in answer to him, then touches the top of her head, looks at her bloody fingers, and then nods weakly. \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nconcerned. \nMITCH Come on, let's take care of that. \nFULL SHOT - THE DOCK \nas they climb onto it. A fisherman standing by looks at Melanie curiously. \nFISHERMAN What happened, Mitch? \nMITCH (over his shoulder) A gull hit her. \nFISHERMAN A what? \nThe CAMERA FOLLOWS them as they walk across the parking area behind the Tides, and to the closest office. Mitch tries the door knob. The door is locked. \nINSERT - SIGN ON DOOR OUT TO LUNCH TWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nas he tries door of next office. It, too, is locked. \nMITCH Come on, we'd better go up to the restaurant. \nThey walk quickly up the slope to the Tides, establishing gas station across the road, the collection of stores opposite, the cars pulling in and out. Mitch opens the door for her, and they ENTER. \nINT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT \nThis is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of a local hangout. There are fishermen lounging at the bar, and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are sitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the bay and the parking area below. A television set over the bar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western movie should be HEARD muted throughout following.  DEKE CARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates his attention between serving his customers and watching the Western. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER. \nMED. SHOT - THE BAR \nMitch and Melanie coming over to it. \nMITCH Deke, have you got a first aid kit back there? \nDEKE (instantly alarmed) What happened? \nMITCH Young woman cut herself. \nDEKE Shall I call the doctor? \nMITCH (accepting the first aid kit) I don't think it's that serious. You want to sit up here? \nMelanie climbs onto the stool. \nDEKE You cut yourself outside, Miss? \nMITCH Stop worrying, Deke. She was in a boat. \nHe is rummaging around in the kit. \nDEKE I had a man trip and fall in the parking lot once, sued me before I could bat an eyelash. \nMITCH I don't think Miss Daniels is going to sue anybody. \nDEKE (doubtfully) Well, you're the lawyer. (goes to other end of bar) \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nas he unscrews cap from bottle of peroxide. \nMELANIE What's that? \nMITCH Just some peroxide. I want to clean out the cut. \nHe pours peroxide onto a gauze pad and begins swabbing the cut. They are silent for several seconds. Then: \nMELANIE So you're a lawyer. \nMITCH That's right. What are you doing in Bodega Bay? \nMELANIE Do you practice here? \nMITCH No, San Francisco. What are you...? \nMELANIE What kind of law? \nMITCH Criminal. \nMELANIE Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars? \nMITCH Not everyone, Miss Daniels. \nMELANIE Only violators and practical jokers. \nMELANIE That's right. \nAs he swabs cut. \nMELANIE Ouch! \nMITCH I'm sorry. (pause) What are you doing up here? \nMITCH Yes. \nLYDIA How long have you known her? \nMITCH I told you. We met yesterday. \nLYDIA In a bird shop. \nMITCH Yes. \nLYDIA She was selling birds. \nMITCH No. I only led her into believing I believed she was... Mother, it's really very complicated. \nLYDIA But she did buy the lovebirds and then brought them all the way... \nMITCH Mother, where did you go to law school? \nLYDIA (laughing) Forgive me. I suppose I'm just naturally curious about a girl like that. (pause) She's very rich, isn't she? \nMITCH I suppose so. Her father owns a big newspaper in San Francisco. \nLYDIA You'd think he could manage to keep her name out of print. She's always mentioned in the columns, Mitch. \nMITCH I know, Mother. \nLYDIA She is the one who jumped into that fountain in Rome last summer, isn't she? \nMITCH Yes, Mother. \nLYDIA Perhaps I'm old-fashioned. (pause) I know it was supposed to be very warm there, Mitch, but... well... actually... well, the newspaper said she was naked. \nMITCH I know, Mother. \nLYDIA It's none of my business, of course, but when you bring a girl like that to... \nMITCH Mother? \nLYDIA (looking up) Yes? \nMITCH I think I can handle Melanie Daniels by myself. \nLYDIA Well... (she sighs) So long as you know what you want, Mitch. \nMITCH I know exactly what I want, Mother. \nDISSOLVE \nFULL SHOT - THE BRENNER LAWN - EXTERIOR - NIGHT \nas Mitch and Melanie cross it to her car. A wind is blowing off the water, and high fast clouds are scudding across the face of the moon. \nMITCH You'll be able to find your way back, won't you? \nMELANIE Oh, yes. \nMELANIE Will I be seeing you again? \nMELANIE San Francisco's a long way from here. \nMITCH I'm in San Francisco five days a week. With a lot of time on my hands. I'd like to see you. (he grins) Maybe we could go swimming or something. Mother tells me you like to swim. \nMELANIE How does Mother know what I like to do? \nMITCH I guess she and I read the same gossip columns. \nMELANIE Oh. That. Rome. \nMITCH Mmmm. I like to swim. We might get along very... \nMELANIE In case you're interested, I was pushed into that fountain. \nMELANIE Without any clothes on? \nMELANIE With all my clothes on!  The newspaper that ran the story happens to be a rival of my father's paper.  Anything they said... \nMITCH You were just a poor, innocent victim of circumstance, huh? \nMELANIE I'm neither poor nor innocent, but the truth of that particular... \nMITCH The truth is you were running around with a pretty wild crowd... \nMELANIE Yes, but... \nMITCH ...who didn't much care for propriety or convention or... \nMELANIE Yes. \nMITCH ...the opinions of others, and you went right along with them, isn't that the truth? \nMELANIE Yes, that's the truth. But I was pushed into that fountain, and that's the truth, too. \nMITCH Sure. Do you really know Annie Hayworth? \nMELANIE No. (pause) At least, I didn't until I came up here. \nMITCH So you didn't go to school together. \nMELANIE No. \nMITCH And you didn't come up here to see her. \nMELANIE No. \nMITCH You were lying. \nMELANIE Yes, I was lying. \nMITCH Did you really write a letter to me? Or was that a lie, too? \nMELANIE I wrote the letter. \nMITCH What did it say? \nMELANIE It said, \"Dear Mr. Brenner, I think you need those lovebirds, after all. They may help your personality.\" That's what it said. \nMITCH But you tore it up. \nMELANIE Yes. \nMITCH Why? \nMELANIE Because it seemed stupid and foolish. \nMITCH Like jumping into a fountain in Rome! \nMELANIE I told you what happened in Rome! \nMITCH Do you expect me to believe...? \nMELANIE I don't give a damn what you believe! \nAngrily she gets into the car, is about to slam the door when Mitch catches it in his hands. \nANNIE I think I'll have some of that, too. (she pours brandy, drinks, sighs) I was seeing quite a lot of him in San Francisco, you know. (she smiles weakly) And then, one weekend, he asked me up to meet Lydia. \nMELANIE When was this? \nANNIE Four years ago. Of course, that was shortly after his father died.  Things may be different now. \nMELANIE Different? \nANNIE With Lydia. (pause) Did she seem a trifle distant? \nMELANIE (smiling) A trifle. \nANNIE Then maybe it isn't different at all. You know, her attitude nearly drove me crazy. I simply couldn't understand it. \nANNIE When I got back to San Francisco I spent days trying to figure out just what I'd done to displease her. \nMELANIE And what had you done? \nANNIE Nothing! I simply existed. So what was the answer? A jealous woman, right? A clinging possessive mother. (she shakes her head) Wrong. With all due respect to Oedipus, I don't think that was the case at all. \nMELANIE Then what was it? \nANNIE Lydia liked me, you see. That was the strange part of it. In fact, now that I'm no longer a threat, we're very good friends. \nMELANIE Then why did she object to you? \nANNIE Because she was afraid. \nMELANIE Afraid you'd take Mitch? \nANNIE Afraid I'd give Mitch. \nMELANIE I don't understand. \nANNIE Afraid of any woman who'd give Mitch the only thing Lydia can give him -- love. \nMELANIE Annie, that adds up to a jealous, possessive woman. \nANNIE No, I don't think so. She's not afraid of losing her son, you see.  She's only afraid of being abandoned. \nMELANIE Someone ought to tell her she'd be gaining a daughter. \nANNIE She already has a daughter. \nMELANIE What about Mitch? Didn't he have anything to say about this? \nANNIE (apologetically) I can understand his position. He went through a lot with Lydia after his father died. He didn't want to risk going through it all over again. \nMELANIE I see. \nANNIE So it ended. Not immediately, of course. I went back to San Francisco, and I still saw Mitch every now and then... but we both knew it was finished. \nMELANIE Then what are you doing here in Bodega Bay? \nANNIE You get straight to the point, don't you? \nMELANIE I'm sorry. Forgive me. \nANNIE No, that's all right, I don't mind. I came up here for two reasons. To begin with, I was bored with my job in San Francisco. I was teaching at a private school there... well, you know, you probably went to one yourself. \nMELANIE I did. \nANNIE Then you know. Little girls in brown beanies. Deadly. Here I have a life. I'll go into that classroom on Monday morning, and I'll look out at twenty- five upturned little faces, and each of them will be saying, 'Yes, please give me what you have.' (pause) And I'll give them what I have. I haven't got very much, but I'll give them every ounce of it. To me, that's very important. It makes me want to stay alive for a long long time. (she sighs) That's the first reason. \nMELANIE And the second? \nANNIE (simply) I wanted to be near Mitch. (pause) It was over, and I knew it, but I wanted to be near him, anyway. (she smiles) You see, I still like him a hell of a lot. That's rare, I think. I don't want to lose his friendship... ever. \nThere is a moment of silence. Into the silence, the TELEPHONE shrills. Annie hesitates a moment, and then goes to answer it. \nCLOSE SHOT - ANNIE \nat the phone. \nANNIE Hello?  Oh, hello. No, no, I wasn't asleep. What is it? (pause) Yes, just a little while ago. Sure, hold on. (she turns to Melanie) It's Mitch. For you. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE \nas they stare at each other across the room, Melanie hesitating. \nANNIE He's waiting. \nMelanie rises and goes to the phone. The CAMERA FOLLOWS Annie to the wing chair in the foreground and stays on her throughout following, recording her reactions as Melanie talks to Mitch in the background. \nAnnie is not devastated by this call, and yet there is a wistfulness to her expression as she realizes she may finally and irrevocably be losing Mitch to another girl. \nMELANIE (at phone; coolly) Hello? Yes, this is Melanie. Fine, thank you. No, no trouble at all.  I simply followed the road. It's a very bright night. (pause) What?  Oh. Well, there's no need to apologize. I can understand... (pause; she listens) Well... (she listens again) That's very kind of you. No, I'm not angry. (she listens) I couldn't. I'm afraid I have to get back to San Francisco. (pause) No, I wouldn't want to disappoint Cathy, but... (pause) I see. (she is warming) I see. Well, if you really... (pause) All right. Yes, I'll be there. (pause) Good night, Mitch. \nShe hangs up and looks at Annie in embarrassment. \nMELANIE He wants me to go to Cathy's party tomorrow afternoon. (pause) I said I would. \nANNIE I'll be going, too, to help out. It should be fun, Melanie. \nMELANIE It seems so pointless. (she sighs) I think I'll go to sleep. This has been a busy day. (picking up her paper bag) My luggage. \nShe smiles, takes out a flowered muumuu, holds it up to Annie. \nANNIE Pretty. Did you get that at Brinkmeyer's? \nMelanie nods and drapes the muumuu over her arm. She is silent for a moment, pensive. Then: \nMELANIE Do you think I should go? \nANNIE That's up to you. \nMELANIE It's really up to Lydia, isn't it? \nANNIE Never mind Lydia. Do you want to go? \nMELANIE (firmly) Yes. \nANNIE Then go. \nThe room is silent. Melanie nods, slowly, and then smiles. \nMELANIE Thank you, Annie. \nSuddenly, into the silence, comes a THUMP at the door, startling them both. \nANNIE (rising) Who can that be at this hour? (she walks to door) Who is it? (no answer) Is someone there? \nMelanie goes to stand beside Annie. Puzzled, Annie unlocks the door, and then opens it. She looks out into the night. There is nothing but the SOUND of the wind. \nANNIE (to the emptiness outside) Is anyone there? \nMELANIE (pointing to the ground) Look. \nCLOSE SHOT - A DEAD SEAGULL \nCLOSE SHOT - ANNIE \nANNIE (sympathetically) Ohhh. Oh, the poor thing. He probably lost his way in the dark. \nMED. SHOT - ANNIE \nwith Cathy and the children around. The CAMERA PANS DOWN as she ducks with two gulls swooping by. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \nhurriedly putting the cake onto the table. She rushes round to the front of it. \nFULL SHOT - ANNIE - LYDIA'S P.O.V. \nAnnie rising from the ground.

A puzzled look crosses his face. He turns to Melanie. \nMITCH Are you all right? \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nMELANIE Yes. \nANNIE (coming over) That's the darnest thing thing I've ever seen in my life. \nTWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH \nLYDIA Are they gone? \nMITCH They're gone, Mother. \nFULL SHOT - THE LAWN \nas the children begin drifting back toward the table and the cake. There is the curious feeling of lighting having struck very close by without having injured anyone. All that adrenaline has boiled up, and now it has no place to go. \nLYDIA Well... well, is everyone all right? \nMITCH (with a small boy) I think he got a little scratch, Mother. \nGIRL #3 Did you see them? They were hawks! \nGIRL #4 They were bigger than hawks! \nANNIE Children, they were only seagulls. \nAnd then the meaning of what she has just said strikes her, and she remembers the bird hitting her door the night before. \nTWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE \nas Annie turns to look at her and they exchange a silent meaningful glance. \nBACK TO SCENE \nCATHY They must have been after the food, Mother. \nThey all turn toward the table. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE TABLE AND THE REST OF THE FOOD ON THE TABLE, UNDISTURBED CLOSE SHOT - MITCH \neyes narrowed. \nMITCH They didn't touch anything. \nBACK TO SCENE \nANNIE (trying to restore order) Well, they're gone now, so... so let's... (pause) Who was 'it?' You were 'it,' weren't you, Cathy? \nGIRL #2 Can I be 'it,' Miss Hayworth? \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nas Annie and the children begin the game behind them. \nMITCH You look a little shaken. \nMELANIE I... I am. (pause) Mitch, is... Mitch, this isn't usual, is it? The gull yesterday when I was in the boat, and the one last night at Annie's, and now... \nMITCH Last night? What do you mean? \nMELANIE A gull smashed into Annie's front door. (pause) Mitch... what's happening? \nMITCH (concerned) I don't know, Melanie. (pause) Look, do you have to go back to Annie's? \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nrealizing it's impossible to run. They must stay and fight. \nMITCH (shouting) Cathy, get some matches! \nMED. SHOT - CATHY \nrunning for the kitchen. Birds swooping after her. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nswinging the fireplace broom. \nMED. SHOT - MITCH \nrushing to the fireplace.

Birds are still pouring out, past the paper beginning to catch. \nCLOSE SHOT - ANOTHER WINDOW PANE \nas a bird crashes through it. \nMED.

The curtains! \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nturning, seeing, his eyes opening wide. \nMED. SHOT - MITCH \nripping at the flaming curtain. He throws it to the floor, begins stamping on it. \nCLOSE SHOT - CATHY \nCATHY It's working! The fire's working! \nCLOSE SHOT - THE FIREPLACE \nonly the blazing fire. No more birds entering. \nMED.

The burnt curtain is still smoldering. Mitch is covered with soot. Melanie puts down the broom wearily. The attack is over. \nDISSOLVE \nINT. BRENNER LIVING ROOM - CLOSE SHOT - A HAND \nreaching down to pick up a dead bird. \nMED. SHOT - AL MALONE, THE DEPUTY \na plain man with a limited intelligence, used to giving out speeding tickets or warning drunks. He holds the bird on the palm of his hand, looks at it steadily, nodding all the while. \nMALONE That's a chimney swift, all right. \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nMITCH We know what it is, Al. \nFULL SHOT - THE ROOM \nLydia is huddled in one of the easy chairs, still in shock. \nMALONE Well, these birds live in chimneys, you know. \nMITCH Not by the thousands. \nMALONE No, I gotta admit this is peculiar. (pause) Did you have a light burning or something. \nas Cathy, carrying her schoolbooks, runs to the pickup truck and climbs in. The truck moves out of the yard and down the road. It turns the bend, and moves out of sight. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nturning from the window. She goes to the bedroom door, CAMERA FOLLOWING. She opens the door. \nMELANIE Mitch? \nThere is no answer. \nMELANIE Mitch? \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE \ncoming down the steps from the attic room. The house is empty. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her into the dining room, where she stops at the cage of lovebirds, bends down to them with a smile on her face. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS \nShe smiles and pokes her finger into the cage. The birds TWEET at her. \nMELANIE (imitating them) Chee-chee-chee-chee-chee. \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE \nleaving the cage.

She picks up the cup again, walks to the front door and EXITS. \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE \ncoming out of the house and into the garden, carrying the cup of coffee. It is a beautiful day. She sips at her coffee and then breathes deeply of the air. \nCLOSE SHOT - HER FACE \nfresh, rested. There is a contentment in her which we have not seen before. She looks off toward the shore. \nLONG SHOT - MITCH \non the shore, working with the rake. The thin column of smoke is climbing the sky. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nShe turns her attention away from Mitch, and walks to the end of the garden toward the shore. A wind is blowing off the water, moving white puffs of cloud swiftly across the sky, whipping the full short shirt of muumuu about her legs as she walks. She stands there silhouetted against the sky for a moment. \nSLOW PAN \nas Melanie scans the horizon. There isn't a bird anywhere in sight. The day is still and clear, but somehow ominous in its silence. Her gaze comes to rest on Mitch and the thin column of smoke again. In the distance, Mitch sees her and raises his arm in greeting. She waves back at him. He puts the rake down and begins walking toward the house. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nThere is anticipation on her face now. She watches Mitch coming toward her, her eyes glowing. \nFULL SHOT - MITCH \ncloser to the house now. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nwaiting, anticipating. \nMED. SHOT - MITCH \nHe stops, looks at her, and then turns toward the house. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nas first surprised, and then puzzled. The back screen DOOR CLATTERS shut off screen. A small hurt look crosses her face. \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE \nas she turns away from the house and begins walking in the garden, sipping idly at her coffee. A screen DOOR CLATTERS again. She turns. \nMitch is coming out of the house, from the front door, wearing a different shirt, buttoning it as he walks to her. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nMITCH I wanted to change my shirt. \nMelanie is uncomprehending. \nMITCH It smelled of the fire. \nMELANIE (nodding) It's hard to believe anything at all happened yesterday, isn't it? It's so beautiful and still now. (pause; then sagely) I think I've got it all figured out, by the way. \nMITCH Really? Tell me about it. \nMELANIE (secretively) It's an uprising. \nMITCH Of birds? \nMELANIE Certainly, of birds. \nMitch grins. \nMELANIE It all started several months ago with a peasant sparrow up in the hills, a malcontent. He went around telling all the other sparrows that human beings weren't fit to rule this planet, preaching wherever anyone would listen... \nMITCH Growing a beard... \nMELANIE (delighted) Yes, of course, he had to have a beard! 'Birds of the world, unite!' he kept saying, over and over... \nMITCH So they united. \nMELANIE Not at first. Oh yes, a few sparrows out for kicks... \nMITCH Well, they'll go along with anything. \nMELANIE Sure. But eventually, even the more serious-minded birds began to listen. \"Why should humans rule?\" they asked themselves. \nMITCH Hear! \nMELANIE Why should we submit ourselves to their domination? \nMITCH Hear, hear! \nMELANIE And all the while, that sparrow was getting in his little messages. Birds of the world, unite! \nMITCH Take wing! \nMELANIE You have nothing to lose but your feathers. \nThey both burst out laughing, then fall into silence, then laugh again and finally are silent. The garden is deathly still. \nMITCH (attempting to be serious) What it was, probably... \nMELANIE Mmm? \nMITCH They're probably hungry, that's all. This was a bad summer. They eat berries and... and nuts, you know, and the hills are all burned out, so they're probably searching for food wherever they can get it. \na small knowledgeable nod of her head. The chicken's reaction strengthens her determination to talk to Fawcett.  She turns. \nFULL SHOT - LYDIA \napproaching the front door again. She knocks. No answer. \nLYDIA Dan? \nShe backs away from the house again. The barnyard is silent. In the distance, we can HEAR the SOUND of the tractor. \nLYDIA Dan? Are you home? \nNo answer. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \na little annoyed. She glances at the ground floor window closest to the door. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE WINDOW \nA small pane of glass is broken. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \npuzzled. \nFULL SHOT - LYDIA \ngoing to the front door, trying the knob. \nMED. SHOT - LYDIA \nThe door opening ahead of her as she pokes her head into the house. \nLYDIA Dan? \nThe house is still and silent. \nINT. THE ENTRY HALL - FULL SHOT \nas Lydia comes in. We can see the living room off to the right, but it looks normal and untouched. Lydia turns to her left and looks down a long corridor. \nFULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V. \na door at the end of it is partially ajar, spilling artificial light into the corridor. \nLYDIA Dan? \nNo answer. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \na little troubled. She seems deciding whether or not she should leave. A determined look comes over her face. \nFULL SHOT - THE CORRIDOR - LYDIA'S P.O.V. \nas she walks down it slowly toward the open door at the opposite end. Outside the door, she pauses. \nLYDIA Dan? Are you in there? \nNo answer. Lydia puts out her hand, slowly begins showing the door open. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \ncoming into the room. Her eyes begin to take in the room. \nSLOW PAN OF THE ROOM - LYDIA'S P.O.V. \nstarting to the right of the doorway as she enters and continuing a little below eye level, the CAMERA PICKS OUT: A standing floor lamp, the shade dangling, but the light still burning; a picture hanging askew on the wall, its glass shattered; the window to the left of the picture, every pane of glass shattered; a dresser with two stuffed birds on its top; both birds have been badly damaged, the stuffing ripped out of them, the head of one hanging at a crooked near decapitated angle; the window to the left of the dresser, all the panes shattered. The level of the CAMERA DESCENDS, and begins a SLOW PAN of the floor. It PICKS OUT broken glass, continues its PAN to SHOW scattered feathers, continues its PAN to SHOW a broom, feathers caught in the straw, a single bedroom slipper, continues to SHOW a pair of legs in pajamas, one foot bare, the other slippered, and then immediately \nCUTS TO: \nCLOSE SHOT - DAN FAWCETT \nHis face. Covered with blood, the eyes missing from their empty staring sockets.  Immediately \nCUT TO: \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \na terrified scream erupting from her mouth. \nFULL SHOT - LYDIA \nturning and running for the door. The CAMERA FOLLOWS her in an unbroken headlong flight, the scream continuing as if she is incapable of stopping it, as she stumbles, runs, trips her way down the corridor and bursts out of the house, still screaming, into the pickup truck. The engine starts, she backs the truck out at breakneck speed and hits the highway, \nCAMERA FOLLOWING.  CLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \nat the wheel, her face stamped with terror, her eyes wide. \nFULL SHOT - THE TRUCK \nat breakneck speed, negotiating the severe curves on the highway. It almost hits a small car coming from the opposite direction, swerves, screeches around the curve. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \nbehind the wheel, unmindful of anything but flight. \nFULL SHOT - THE ROAD - LYDIA'S POV \nthrough the windshield, blurring past. She turns the bend leading to the house. For an instant, through the windshield, there is a quick glimpse of Melanie and Mitch in embrace in the garden. Then the tires shriek, and the truck turns and barrels into the front yard. \nFULL SHOT - MITCH \nalarmed as he runs out of the garden and toward the truck just as it jerks to a stop. \nMED. SHOT - MITCH \nthrough the truck as he pulls open the door opposite Lydia. \nMITCH (alarmed) What is it? \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nas he sees his mother. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \nslumped on the wheel of the car, her head on her arms, sobbing. On her sobs... \nDISSOLVE \nINT. BRENNER KITCHEN - MED. SHOT - MELANIE \nat the kitchen stove, taking a kettle of tea from the burner. She pours it into a cup, puts the cup on a tray already set with sugar and creamer. She looks up as Mitch comes into the kitchen. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nMITCH That was Al on the phone. He wants me to meet him out at the Fawcett place. Says some detectives from Santa Rosa'll be there in a little while. (pause) Will you be all right here? \nMELANIE Yes. I was just taking her in some tea. \nHe goes to her, puts his arms around her from behind, kisses her hair. But she turns in his arms suddenly and clings to him fiercely, and then buries her head in his shoulder. \nA bird dives to head of Michele and she falls OUT of picture. \nEXT.

THE TIDES - FULL SHOT \nIt is lunchtime and there is a busy bustle to the place as DEKE CARTER officiates behind the bar and HELEN CARTER, his wife, rushes back and forth between diners at the tables. A DRUNK sits at the bar, old, grizzled, the weary wisdom of booze in him. In one of the booths sits SEBASTIAN SHOLES in his shirt sleeves, eating a hurried lunch quickly and efficiently. A WOMAN and TWO CHILDREN are seated at another table, about to order. A party of noisy SALESMAN is laughing and clowning around throughout following at a table in the rear. The phone from behind the bar has been placed on the counter, and Melanie is speaking into it while Deke listens. Over her head, the television set is blasting with its perennial Western, the gun shots punctuating her conversation. \nMELANIE Daddy, there were hundreds of them. No, I'm not hysterical, I'm trying to tell you this as calmly as I know how. All right, Daddy. Yes Daddy. (she takes a deep breath) Just now.  Not... fifteen minutes ago. \nThe door to the Tides opens and MRS. BUNDY, sixtyish, wearing walking shoes and a tweed suit, a very masculine-looking woman with short clipped white hair, comes in, passes through foreground, goes to bar, her attention slowly caught by what Melanie is saying. \nMELANIE At the school. No, I don't. Just a minute. (to Deke) What's the name of the school? \nDEKE Just the Bodega Bay School. (to Mrs. Bundy) Help you, Mrs. Bundy? \nMRS. BUNDY I need some change, Mr. Carter. \nAs Deke opens cash register... \nMELANIE The Bodega Bay School. (to Deke) Could you turn that down, please? \nDeke gives Mrs. Bundy her change, turns off television. \nMELANIE I don't know how many children. Thirty or forty. Yes. \nMrs. Bundy goes to cigarette machine, pauses to listen to Melanie. \nMELANIE No, the birds didn't attack until the children were outside the school. Crows, I think. I don't know, Daddy. Is there a difference between crows and blackbirds? \nMRS. BUNDY (turning from machine) There is very definitely a difference, Miss. \nMELANIE They're different, Daddy. (to Mrs. Bundy) Thank you. (into phone) I think these were crows. Yes, hundreds of them. Yes, they attacked the children, attacked them. (exasperated) Daddy, a little girl was sent to the hospital in Santa Rosa. Well, all right, but you act as if I'm... all right, all right. (pause) No, I can't come home now. I just can't, Daddy. How is it there? I mean... are there birds? In the sky? But no trouble. Well, I hope... (pause) I don't know when. I simply can't leave now. Tell Mother not to worry. All right, Daddy, good-by. \nShe hangs up. Mrs. Bundy is at her elbow. \nA TRAVELING SALESMAN ENTERS, goes to bar, listens. \nMRS. BUNDY Doesn't it seem odd that they'd wait all that time to start a... a war against humanity? \nMELANIE No one called it a war! \nSALESMAN Scotch, light on the water. \nMRS. BUNDY You and Mr. Sholes seem to be implying as much. \nHELEN Are you finished here, Sebastian? \nSHOLES Let me have some apple pie, Helen. (to Mrs. Bundy) Who said anything about war? All I said was that some gulls... \nHELEN (yelling to kitchen) One apple pie! You want more coffee? \nSHOLES No. ...came down on one of my boats. They could have been after the fish, just as you said. \nSALESMAN Your captain should have shot at them. \nSHOLES What? \nSALESMAN Gulls are scavengers, anyway. Most birds are. If you ask me, we should wipe them all out. World would be better off without them. \nMRS. BUNDY (outraged) Birds? \nSALESMAN Yeah, birds. All they do is make a mess of everything. Who needs them? \nMRS. BUNDY We need them. \nSALESMAN Not if they're starting a war. \nMRS. BUNDY They are incapable of organized warfare! \nMELANIE Have you ever seen a jay protecting a nest? \nMRS. BUNDY I have seen jays doing everything it is conceivable for jays to do. Ornithology happens to be my avocation, Miss Daniels. You're talking about preservation of the species, a hen protecting her young. There's a vast difference between... \nMELANIE Maybe they're all protecting the species. Maybe they're tired of being shot at and roasted in ovens and... \nMRS. BUNDY Are you discussing gamebirds now? All birds are not gamebirds, you know. \nMELANIE I don't know anything about birds except that they're attacking this town. \nSALESMAN Then fight back. Get yourselves guns and wipe them off the face of the earth. \nMRS. BUNDY That would hardly be possible. \nDEKE Why not, Mrs. Bundy? \nMRS. BUNDY Because there are 8,650 species of birds in the world today, Mr. Carter. It's estimated that five billion, seven hundred and fifty million birds live in the United States alone. The five continents of the world... \nSALESMAN (muttering) Kill them all. Get rid of them. Messy animals. \nMRS. BUNDY ...probably contain more than a hundred billion birds! \nDRUNK It's the end of the world! \nDEKE Well, we seem to have more than our share of them right now, Mrs. Bundy. Maybe this young lady's right.  Maybe they've all gone crazy. \nHELEN Here's your pie, Sebastian. You want it at the table? \nSHOLES No. Here's fine. (he begins eating) \nHELEN Where are the Bloody Marys, Deke? \nDEKE Coming. \nHELEN (angrily) Are we running a business here -- or a bird sanctuary? \nSHOLES (beginning to change his mind) Actually, those gulls must have been after the fish. \nMRS. BUNDY Of course. \nSHOLES Makes a lot more sense than... well, an attack. \nMRS. BUNDY Of course it does. If we believe that birds are attacking, why... why next we'll believe that grasshoppers and cockroaches are capable of... \nDRUNK Cockroaches!  Urghh! \nCLOSE SHOT - WOMAN \ngetting more and more anxious. \nWOMAN Hurry, children. Finish your lunch. \nBOY Are the birds gonna eat us, Mommy? \nSHOLES Maybe we're all getting a little carried away by this. Admittedly, a few birds acted strangely. That's no reason to believe... \nMELANIE This isn't a few birds! I keep telling you that! These are gulls and swifts and crows and... \nMRS. BUNDY And what? Vultures? Hawks? Eagles? \nMELANIE Maybe! Is it impossible? \nMRS. BUNDY Yes. I have never known birds of different species to flock together. The very concept is unimaginable. (laughing) Why if that happened, we wouldn't have a chance. How could we possible hope to fight them? \nSHOLES We couldn't. You're right, Mrs. Bundy. \nWOMAN (calling from table) Excuse me, may I have a check, please? \nHELEN (concerned) Is everything all right, ma'am? \nWOMAN Yes, I... I'm anxious to get on the road. \nSAM (coming from kitchen) What's the matter? Something wrong out here? \nDEKE Nothing's wrong. \nSAM All this shouting. \nMRS. BUNDY We're fighting a war, Sam. \nSAM A war? Against who? Did the Russians...? \nSHOLES Against birds. \nWOMAN (suddenly) I'm glad you all think this is so amusing. You've frightened my children half out of their wits. \nBOY I'm not scared, Mommy. \nWOMAN Keep quiet. If that young lady saw an attack on the school, why won't you believe her? \nSAM What attack? Who attacked the school? \nWOMAN Birds did. Crows! And you're all sitting around here debating! What do you want them to do next? Crash through that window? \nLITTLE GIRL (frightened by her mother) Mommy! \nWOMAN Quiet! Why don't you all get home? Lock your doors and windows! (her hysteria rising) Put on your coats, children! (to Deke) What's the fastest road to San Francisco? \nDEKE The freeway, ma'am. \nMRS. BUNDY Birds are not bad! \nSHOLES How can we go on living here if we blanket the town with smoke? \nMITCH Can we go on living here otherwise? \nPause. They are silent. \nSAM (slowly) It's worth a try, Sebastian. \nThere is more silence as they all consider. And then suddenly: \nMELANIE Look! \nThey turn toward the window. \nTIDES CAR PARK - FULL SHOT \nViewed from the side window inside the Tides we see three or four gulls diving down toward the highway over the roof of the Tides Office. Two more swoop into the foreground of the window and out to the left. \nDEKE (alarmed) Gulls! \nMITCH They're back! \nSHOLES They're only the usual... What are you... \nTIDES TOWN - LONG SHOT \nThe first gull reaches the gas station but misses the attendant who is in the act of filling the car. The owner is seen disappearing into the men's room. \nINT. TIDES \nA quick flash of the group of faces at the window of the Tides Restaurant. \nTIDES TOWN - MED. SHOT \nA nearer view of the gas station. A second gull hits the man on the back -- he falls -- hits his head on the pump and then collapses over the gasoline hose pipe, pulling it out and causing it to spill. The third and fourth gulls sweep by.  The gas begins to flow away. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \ninside the Tides. Mitch dashes toward the door -- Melanie after him. Through the glass windows into the street we see people dashing off to the right, in the direction of the gas station. At the door, Mitch turns. \nMITCH (to Melanie) Stay back in here. \nDeke Carter comes running from behind the bar to join Mitch. They both EXIT. Melanie dashes back to her original place at the window. The CAMERA RETREATING with her, we come to the window and over Melanie's shoulder we see the men arrive to rescue the attacked gas station attendant. \nThree or four gulls are still attacking and they flutter away as the men appear to beat them off. Suddenly Melanie in the foreground turns in full profile to her right and looks down. \nTIDES CAR PARK - MED. SHOT \non the sloping pavement before her a stream of gasoline is flowing to the right into the car park. \nCLOSE SHOT - GASOLINE \nflowing down to the car park. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nthrough the window. She suddenly looks toward the gas station. \nMED. SHOT - THE CAMERA PANS \nalong the flowing gas back to the station. \nCLOSEUP - MELANIE \nShe turns back to the car park. \nFROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT \nWe see the flow of gasoline trickling toward the car parked below her. At this particular moment, a car has pulled up, has come to a stop and a man emerges. He is in the act of lighting his dead cigar, but his attention is drawn to the happenings around the gas station. With this half-drawn attention, he strikes the match and holds it to the cigar. \nCLOSEUP - MELANIE \nShe quickly slides the window open and yells down to the man. \nFROM MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT \nThe man looks about him, holding the match I his fingers. As he catches sight of Melanie, the match burns his finger and he drops it. \nCLOSEUP - MELANIE \nHer horror-stricken face. \nFULL SHOT - THE PARKING AREA \nThree fast explosions in a row as the man's car, Mitch's car, and the one next to it go up in flames. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE HORRIFIED FACE OF MELANIE \nTURNING TO SEE \nFULL SHOT - THE GAS STATION \nThe line of flame running swiftly from the burning cars, following the gasoline on the ground, directly to the pump, which blows up as the men are jumping away with the injured attendant. \nEXT. TIDES TOWN AND CAR PARK - MATTE SHOT \nA very high shot shows the beginning of the people of the town rushing around the car park and the streets across the highway, endeavoring to put out the two fires. We see automobiles coming to a stop on Highway One, and the oil smoke beginning to rise from the burning gas station and the parked cars. Some men have managed to start a fire hose and have trained it on the burning cars. Suddenly but slowly the foreground in the sky just below the CAMERA begins to fill with wheeling gulls. The whole picture below becomes obliterated by the foreground birds who now begin to swoop down on the town. \nEXT. TIDES TOWN \nA raking shot outside the Tides Restaurant showing the phone booth and motel off in the background. People are rushing out from the restaurant and look up in the sky. Gulls begin to descend into the scene, driving the people back into the restaurant. Melanie is seen in the distance calling for Mitch: \nMELANIE Mitch...! Mitch! \nWe see her look up to the sky. \nLONG SHOT - THE SKY \nThe sky is full of seagulls. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nLooking about her frantically. She turns her face up again to see the descending gulls. She is driven to take refuge in the phone booth. \nCLOSEUP - INSIDE THE PHONE BOOTH - MELANIE \nslams the door shut. Gulls are now beating at the glass all around her. \nEXT. TIDES TOWN \nFrom Melanie's viewpoint inside the booth we see the people who have been rushing to put out the fire now faced with clouds of birds coming on them. \nCLOSEUP - MELANIE \nlooking out in terrified alarm but still searching with her eyes for Mitch. \nMED. SHOT - PEOPLE RUSHING FROM THE TIDES \nCLOSEUP - MELANIE \nin the phone booth. She turns and looks swiftly in the direction of the car park. \nLYDIA When do you think they'll come? \nMITCH I don't know. \nLYDIA If there are... larger birds, Mitch... they'll get into the house. \nMITCH That's a chance we have to take. \nLYDIA Maybe we ought to leave. \nMITCH Not now.  Not while they're massing out there. \nLYDIA When? \nMITCH I don't know when.  We'll see what... \nLYDIA Where will we go? \nMITCH I don't know yet.  I think we'll be safe here. (Pause) Let's bring that wood in. \nLYDIA What happens when we run out of wood? \nMusic begins to play.  The music is sweet, with violins and long piano arpeggios, almost too much to bear against the tension being played in front of it. \nMITCH I don't know. We'll break up the furni... \nLYDIA (shouting) You don't know, you don't know! When will you know? When we're all dead? Like Annie? \nCATHY (shrieking it, her face white) Mother! \nLYDIA (at Mitch) If your father were here... \nMITCH (sharply) Mother! I'm trying my best! (shaking his head) I'm... trying... my... \nLYDIA (trembling, nodding) I'm sorry, Mitch. \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nthe strain showing on his face. He nods briefly. \nMITCH Let's get the wood. Why don't you make us all some coffee, Mother? \nFULL SHOT - HOUSE \nas Melanie and Mitch come out and head for the pile of wood. There is a NOISE in the sky. Startled, glancing upward, they begin to run back toward the house and then stop and slowly scan the sky. \nFULL SHOT - ENORMOUS FLOCK OF BIRDS \nflying in tight formation. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nMELANIE Where are they heading? \nMITCH Inland. \nMELANIE Santa Rosa? \nMITCH Maybe. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nwatching the birds. A look of utter sadness crosses her face. It is clear that she is thinking the birds will reach Santa Rosa, and eventually San Francisco as well. \nMITCH (O.S.) (gently) Come on. Let's get this wood in. \nMelanie nods. But the look of sadness stays on her face, and her eyes remain on the sky. \nDISSOLVE \nFULL SHOT - THE LIVING ROOM \nLydia is pouring coffee into cups. In the dining room, we can HEAR the CHATTER of the lovebirds. As Lydia pours the sound distracts her. Cathy is sorting candles at the couch. There is evidence of preparation everywhere: flashlights, kerosene lamps, a butane burner. Mitch is at the fireplace putting more wood on the fire. Melanie comes into the room and dumps another load. \nMELANIE That's the last of it. \nLYDIA Did you close the door? \nMELANIE And locked it. \nCATHY Mitch, can I bring the lovebirds in here? \nLYDIA (snapping it) No! \nCATHY Mom, they're in a cage! \nLYDIA They're birds! \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nstudying his mother, realizing how close she is to breaking. \nMITCH (softly) Let them stay in the other room. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \nher hand trembling as she pours the coffee. \nFULL SHOT - THE ROOM \nas they all sit and accept their coffee. The room is silent except for the CRACKLE of the fire. Mitch rises to put more wood on the fire. In the dining room, the lovebirds still are CHATTERING wildly. Their chirping is the only sound in the house. \nCATHY Mitch? Why are they doing this?  The birds. \nMITCH (putting wood on fire) I don't know, honey. \nCATHY Why are they trying to kill people? \nMITCH I wish I could say. But if I could answer that, I could also tell you why people are trying to kill people. \nThe room is silent again except for the TWEETING of the lovebirds offscreen. And then, suddenly, the lovebirds fall silent. \nCLOSE SHOT - CATHY \nturning to look toward the other room, her face going white, her eyes widening. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nwaiting. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \nwaiting. \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nwaiting. \nFULL SHOT - THE ROOM \ndead silent now. Each of them is sitting on the edges of their chairs, waiting. There is the SUDDEN SOUND of splintering glass. \nLYDIA Mitch... \nMELANIE (whispering) Mitch? \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nas she turns toward him. \nMELANIE (still whispering) Mitch? \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nasleep. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nseeing this, making her decision. The SOUND is still coming from somewhere in the house. She decides to let Mitch sleep, picks up a very long flashlight. \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE \nas she goes through the house, checking. She stops in the entry hall, plays the flashlight over the furniture piled against the door. Everything seems all right. She goes into the kitchen, again, checks the door, and then plays the beam on the boarded windows. Satisfied, she goes down the corridor outside the bedroom. She opens the first bedroom door, enters, goes to the windows, plays the beam on them.  Everything's all right. She comes into the corridor again, opens the second bedroom door, again checks windows, and leaves. \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE \nclimbing the steps to the attic. She stops outside the first door upstairs, opens it, goes into the room, plays the light on the windows. Nothing. She comes out into the corridor, goes to the second bedroom, opens the door, enters, walks to the windows. They are boarded securely. She is starting back toward the door when she stops. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nlooking. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE FLOOR \na pile of chipped and broken plaster. \nMED. SHOT - MELANIE \nturning the flashlight up toward the ceiling. \nCLOSE SHOT - THE CEILING \nA huge hole in it, showing moonlit sky outside. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nturning her eyes from the ceiling, determination on her face, and suddenly, her eyes open wide. \nCLOSE SHOT - AN OWL \nsitting in the darkness, staring at her. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nreacting. \nQUICK MED.

She looks up at the \nFULL SHOT - THE CEILING \na swarm of mixed birds coming through the hole and down toward her. \nMED.

SHOT - MELANIE \nswinging the flashlight as the birds attack her. \nMITCH (O.S.) Melanie! \nFULL SHOT - MELANIE AND THE BIRDS \ngrotesque and silent as she struggles with them. The room is a crossing cacophony of mixed light beams and fluttering wings. \nMITCH (O.S.) Melanie, open the door! \nHe hurls himself against it. Inside the room, where Melanie struggles, we HEAR his hammering on it. Melanie is overwhelmed by the birds. \nShe falls to the floor, the flashlight beside her. In the spreading rays of the light, we see the frantic fluttering of wings as the birds cover her. There is a stronger assault on the door by Mitch outside. \nLYDIA (O.S.) (screaming) Mitch, get her out of there! \nMED. SHOT - THE ROOM \nMelanie, collapsed at the base of the door, is no longer in view. Neither are the birds, whose fluttering shadows we see on the door as Mitch again hits it from outside. \nMITCH (O.S.) Melanie! \nThe door begins to open. \nFULL SHOT - MITCH \nas the door bursts inward and he stumbles into the room.  He begins swinging at the birds immediately, reaching down for Melanie, fighting off the attack at the same time. He begins dragging her out of the room. Her clothes have almost been shredded from her body, and her face is torn and bleeding. We catch only quick glimpses of her near-nudity, as Mitch pulls her into the corridor and then, holding the door shut behind him with one hand, delivers swinging furious blows at the few birds that have escaped into the corridor. \nMITCH Mother, get a rope! \nLYDIA Oh, my God, look at her! \nMITCH (shouting) Get a rope! \nShe rushes off. He struggles grotesquely with the birds. There is a wild fury in him, and a methodical dedication. He will not allow them to defeat him. A large bird strikes his hand, knocking the club from it. \nMED. SHOT - MITCH \nas the bird strikes at his face. He reaches out with his hands, grasping the bird, letting go of the door knob. Another bird flutters into the corridor. \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nin anger and desperation as he throttles the bird with his hands. He reaches behind him to grab the doorknob again, and is immediately attacked by the other bird. \nMITCH (yelling) Mother! Hurry! \nTWO SHOT - LYDIA AND MITCH \nas she runs up the steps and into the corridor, carrying a heavy piece of rope. Mitch grabs the bird and hurls it angrily to the floor. Lydia is staring down at Melanie in terror and compassion. He takes the rope from her, loops it over the doorknob, pulls it taut across the hallway, and ties it to the bannister, sealing the door. He turns immediately to Melanie, picks her up and carries her to the steps, Lydia following. As they go downstairs: \nMITCH Cathy! Get a blanket and some bandages! \nCATHY (at the foot of the stars, on the verge of tears) Is she all right? \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \ncradled against Mitch's shoulder, her face bleeding profusely. \nMELANIE I'm... I'm.... \nCathy closes the door gently, and almost soundlessly. Mitch does the same with his door. \nMELANIE (weakly) Mitch, if they hear the car starting... if they see movement... \nMITCH We'll take it slow until we get to the main road. (pause) Are you ready? \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH'S HAND \nturning the key. The motor springs to life. \nFULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR \nanticipation on all the faces. \nMITCH All right. (he takes a deep breath) Here we go. \nFULL SHOT - THE CAR \nfrom the outside, as it creeps out of the yard. The bay is still, the road is still, the car makes barely a sound as it passes the gate and starts down the road. \nMED. SHOT - THE ROAD AHEAD - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD \nas they begin driving slowly. The wires are down. A small fire is burning in the brush, where the wires made contact. The car continues to move. It turns the first bend in the road. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE - LOOKING THROUGH THE WINDOW \nShe gasps quickly. \nMED. SHOT - A GROUP OF HERONS - AT WATER'S EDGE \nstanding, waiting silently. \nFULL SHOT - THE CAR - INTERIOR \nas the tension begins to starts. \nMITCH Shhh.  Shhhh. \nMED.

At the boarded window, we see a woman and child peering from a gap. \nCLOSE SHOT - CATHY \nreacting. \nFULL SHOT - THE CAR - BIRD'S P.O.V. \nas it threads its way slowly and cautiously along the winding road to town. The birds are sitting on some of the still- standing wires, watching, waiting. \nFULL SHOT - THE TOWN APPROACH - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD as the car turns a bend in the road. There are thousands of birds ahead, on every gutted and smoldering rooftop, on every pole, on every fence. \nLYDIA Mitch! \nMED. SHOT - MITCH \nas he stops the car and looks ahead. \nFULL SHOT - THE CAR \nin the middle of the road, stopped. Ahead are the birds. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nfrightened, try not to reveal her fear. \nMELANIE Can we turn back? \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \nMITCH I... I don't think so. If we get through town, I think we'll be all right. \nFULL SHOT - INT. THE CAR \nThere is a long silence. It is Melanie who has the strongest reason for fearing the birds. It is Melanie, her fear growing, who makes the decision. \nMELANIE Then go ahead, Mitch. \nFULL SHOT - EXT. THE CAR \nas it begins moving forward again at an excruciatingly slow rate of speed, into the town and the waiting birds. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \nas she turns to look out the window on her side. \nCLOSE SHOT - A LINE OF BIRDS \nas the car moves past them slowly. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \nclosing her eyes. \nFULL SHOT - BRINKMEYER'S GENERAL STORE \nthrough the windshield. The roof and sills are covered with birds.

But in the hotel, we see some faces behind broken windows. \nTWO SHOT - CATHY, MITCH \nThe tension on their faces, \nMED. SHOT - THE STORES OPPOSITE THE TIDES \nas the car approaches them. The windows are all broken, and merchandise is lying on the sidewalk.

What time is dinner, Mother? \nLYDIA Seven o'clock, same as usual. \nMITCH I'll pick you up, Miss Daniels. Where are you staying? \nMELANIE With... with Annie, of course. \nMITCH Of course, how stupid of me. A quarter to seven, will that be all right? \nMELANIE Annie... Annie may have made other plans. I'll have to see. Besides, I can find my own way. \nMITCH You're sure now? You won't hire a boat or anything? \nMELANIE I'm sure. \nMITCH Seven o'clock then. \nMELANIE Maybe. \nCLOSE SHOT - MITCH \ngrinning. \nMITCH We'll be waiting. How's your head now? \nMED. SHOT - THE GROUP \nLydia looks at Mitch inquiringly. \nMELANIE (with an overwarm smile) It's nothing, Mrs. Brenner. A gull hit me, that's all. \nLydia stares at her doubtfully. \nDISSOLVE \nEXT. ANNIE HAYWORTH'S HOUSE - FULL SHOT \nMelanie is standing on the front steps, a paper bag in her hands. She rings the doorbell. The ROOM TO LET sign is still in the window. The door suddenly opens. \nANNIE (surprised) Oh, hi! (pause) Did you find her all right? \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND ANNIE \nMELANIE Yes, I did. \nThere is a long awkward pause. Annie smiles expectantly at Melanie. Melanie seems hesitant. \nMELANIE I was wondering... \nANNIE Yes? \nMELANIE That sign. (pause) Do you think I could have the room for a single night? \nANNIE Well, I'd really hope to rent it for... \nMELANIE I would appreciate it. I've tried everywhere in town, and they're all full. \nANNIE (after a pause) Sure. You can have it. (smiles) Where's your bag? In the car? \nMelanie holds up the paper bag. Annie looks at it and then smiles. \nANNIE It's utilitarian, I'll say that for it. \nMELANIE (smiling) I just picked up some things for the night at the general store. You see, I hadn't planned on spending much time here. \nANNIE Yes, I know. Did something unexpected crop up? \nThere is a moment where both women look at each other... When Melanie answers, it is abrupt and a trifle cold -- she is again telling Annie to mind her own business. \nMELANIE Yes. (pause) May I use your phone? I'd like to call home. \nThere is another moment where Annie appraises Melanie's attitude, and then accepts it. She suddenly smiles warmly. \nANNIE Why don't you come in then?  I was just about to mix a martini. \nShe is about to lead Melanie into the house when they both hear a SOUND overhead. They turn to look skyward. \nLONG SHOT - A FLOCK OF LARGE BIRDS \nflying in beautiful precise formation against the sky. \nTWO SHOT - ANNIE AND MELANIE \nANNIE (shaking her head) Don't they ever stop migrating? \nBut Melanie is watching the sky and the birds with a curiously serious expression. \nDISSOLVE \nLONG SHOT - THE APPROACH ROAD to the Brenner house.

In the distance, she sees Mitch, Lydia and Cathy coming from behind the chicken sheds. She raises her arm in greeting. \nMELANIE (calling) Hi! \nFULL SHOT - MITCH, CATHY, LYDIA \nin the distance. Mitch and Cathy raise their arms. \nCATHY (excitedly) Hi! (she breaks into a trot toward Melanie) \nCLOSE SHOT - CATHY as she approaches. She is an eleven-year- old child, clear-eyed, bright, uninhibited, wearing a shirt and blouse, her hair cropped close to her head. She hesitates for just a moment. \nCATHY Miss Daniels? \nMELANIE Yes? \nAnd Cathy flings herself into Melanie's arms, almost knocking her off her feet, hugging her fiercely. \nCATHY They're beautiful!

The three bags I brought. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \nholding the telephone. \nLYDIA Well, it's just no good. The chickens won't eat it. (pause) They're always hungry, Fred. I opened one of the sacks when I got home, and I poured it out for them, and they wouldn't touch it. Now you know chickens as well as I do, and when they won't eat, there's just something wrong with what they're being fed, that's all. (pause) No, they're not fussy chickens. (pause) Who? What's he got to do with it? (pause) Fred, I don't care how much feed you sold him. My chickens... (pause) He did? Dan Fawcett? (pause) This afternoon? (pause) Well, that only proves what I'm saying.

Melanie is playing a Debussy Arabesque: She picks up a cigarette from the ashtray now and again to take a puff. \nCATHY I still don't understand how you knew I wanted lovebirds. \nMELANIE Your brother told me. \nLYDIA (as she goes into kitchen) Then you knew Mitch in San Francisco, is that right? \nMELANIE No, not exactly. \nCATHY Mitch knows lots of people in San Francisco. Of course, they're mostly hoods. \nLYDIA (from the kitchen) Cathy! \nCATHY Well, Mom, he's the first to admit it.

Your brother's practice... \nCATHY Mom, please, I know all the democracy jazz. They're still hoods. (to Melanie) He's got a client now who shot his wife in the head six times. Six times, can you imagine it?

Just a little one. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND CATHY \nThey both glance conspiratorially toward the kitchen. Quickly, Melanie extends the cigarette. Quickly, Cathy takes a small puff. \nCATHY (delighted) Why, it's just like air, isn't it? (determined) When I grow up, I'm gonna smoke like a chimney! I'll be eleven tomorrow, you know. \nMELANIE I know. \nCATHY Are you coming to my party? \nMELANIE I don't think so. (seeing the child's face) I have to get back to San Francisco. \nCATHY Don't you like us? \nMELANIE (touching her hair) Darling, of course I do! \nCATHY Don't you like Bodega Bay? \nMELANIE I don't know yet. \nCATHY Mitch likes it very much. He comes up every weekend, you know, even though he has his own apartment in the city. He says San Francisco is just an ant hill at the foot of a bridge. \nMELANIE (smiling) I guess it does get a little hectic at times. \nCATHY If you do decide to come, don't say I told you about it. It's supposed to be a surprise party. \nMelanie laughs. \nCATHY You see, they've got this whole complicated thing figured out where I'm going over to Michele's for the afternoon, and Michele's mother is going to say she has a headache and would I mind very much if she took me home. Then, when we get back here, all of the kids'll jump out! (pause) Won't you come? Won't you please come? \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE \nshaking her head, glancing toward the kitchen. \nMELANIE I don't think so, Cathy. \nINT.

This is our play period, Miss Hayworth! Gee whiz!  Etc. \nANNIE I'd like you to show her how quiet and obedient you can be. \nThe children again fall silent. \nANNIE We're going to go out of the school now. Those of you who live nearby can go directly home. I want the rest of you to go down the hill, all the way to the hotel. Do you understand? \nCHILDREN All the way down the hill? Gee, Miss Hayworth, we never... Home? Why do we...? \nANNIE (shushing them) I want you to go as quietly as you can, not a sound, until I tell you to run. And then I want you to run as fast as you can. Does everyone understand? (pause - silence) All right. John, would you lead the class, please? \nThe children walk two-by-two to the corridor door.

SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT \nAnd past the heads of the other people who have also turned, we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has gone and gulls are coming in.

The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings to brake, and then sits on the water. The CAMERA continues low over the water, going through thousands of gulls sitting there patiently, as if it is threading itself through a crowd, not a sound, over the gulls, and then lifting to show the Brenner house in the distance. \nFULL SHOT - THE BRENNER HOUSE \nBehind the panes of glass, we can see the boards Mitch nailed across the windows. He is on the roof now, testing the two attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay. \nLONG SHOT - THE BAY \ncovered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is still smoldering.

She is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she stands looking toward the distant smoldering town. \nMELANIE The town looks clear. \nMITCH The bay doesn't. \nMELANIE How long have they been gathering there? \nMITCH The past fifteen minutes. (pause) It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again. \nMelanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay. \nMELANIE I keep thinking of Annie. (she squeezes her eyes shut) \nMITCH (after a long pause) It... it doesn't look very different, does it? A little smoke over the town, but otherwise... \nMELANIE (looking) Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week. \nMITCH It may not be last week again for a long long time. \nThey are both silent. \nMELANIE Look. They're still coming. \nMitch nods. Silence. \nMITCH Do you want to try your father again? (Melanie shakes her head.  Puzzled, Mitch looks at her) \nMELANIE I tried a little while ago. The phone's dead. \nMITCH Have we still got power? \nMELANIE Yes. (leaning against him) I'm tired, Mitch. I'm so very very tired. \nLYDIA (O.S.) Mitch! I'm getting something on the radio! \nINT. THE LIVING ROOM - FULL SHOT \nLydia is hovering near the radio. Cathy is sitting on a footstool. The windows are boarded, and the lights in the room are on. A tremendous amount of static is coming from the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them \nLYDIA I can't get any of the local stations. I think this is San Francisco. \nANNOUNCER ...would include formulation of a central financing committee to handle credit and to allocate responsibility for the various facets of the project. A vote on the motion is expected early tomorrow morning. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nlistening. \nANNOUNCER Continuing with the local news, police are still investigating the series of valuable jade burglaries in the Chinatown area. The round-up of known criminals has not as yet produced a suspect, but Commissioner Nelson said today he was certain the burglaries were quote linked and the work of the team of professionals unquote. (pause) In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill. One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but the majority of children reached safety in the town. (pause) On the national scene today, the opening of the new session of Congress was marked by a State of the Union address that... \nMITCH Is that all? \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) ...drew a standing ovation for the President. The Chief Executive, in discussing our relation to Europe and the rest of the world community said: \"These various elements of our foreign policy lead as I have said to a single goal -- \nMITCH (sighing) We're going to need more wood for the fire. We can't let it go out. \nANNOUNCER (continuing as drone in background) The goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states.  This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future -- a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age.  We will not reach that goal today or tomorrow.  We may not reach it in our lifetime.  But the quest is the great adventure of our century.  We sometimes chafe at the burdens of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices, but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility. (pause) In assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger.  This is our good fortune, and I welcome it now as I did when I first took office. (pause) For it is the fate of this generation -- Of you in the Congress and of me as President -- to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did - not make. But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been ready to seize the burden and the glory of... \nLYDIA (pause) Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch? \nMITCH I got them all, Mother. \n", "test3_id": 1697}

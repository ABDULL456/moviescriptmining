Mitch opens the door for her, and they ENTER. \nINT. THE TIDES - FULL SHOT \nThis is a small neighborhood restaurant, with the feeling of a local hangout. There are fishermen lounging at the bar, and a teenage boy playing one of the pinball machines. Two ladies in housedresses, with their hair in curlers, are sitting at one of the booths, having coffee. The rear wall of the restaurant is almost all window, looking out over the bay and the parking area below. A television set over the bar is going. The shots and horsehoof beats of an old Western movie should be HEARD muted throughout following.  DEKE CARTER, who owns the restaurant with his wife, alternates his attention between serving his customers and watching the Western. He looks up immediately when Mitch and Melanie ENTER. \nMED.

What are you doing in Bodega Bay? \nMELANIE Do you practice here? \nMITCH No, San Francisco. What are you...? \nMELANIE What kind of law? \nMITCH Criminal. \nMELANIE Is that why you'd like to see everyone behind bars? \nMITCH Not everyone, Miss Daniels. \nMELANIE Only violators and practical jokers. \nMELANIE That's right. \nAs he swabs cut. \nMELANIE Ouch! \nMITCH I'm sorry.

Annie Hayworth. \nMELANIE (realizing this was a mistake) Yes. \nMITCH How do you know Annie? \nMELANIE (the lie getting deeper) We... we went to school together. College. \nMITCH Did you!

Here, let me put this on. \nHe takes up a tiny Band-Aid and, tearing the gauze off, says: \nMITCH Bend your head down. This little Band-Aid won't show. \nHe presses the tiny Band-Aid over the cut. Melanie takes a mirror from her handbag and, bending her head down, looks at it. She covers her hair over it as Mitch says: \nMITCH So you came up to see Annie, huh? \nMELANIE Yes. \nMITCH I don't believe you. (grins) I think you came up to see me. \nMELANIE Why would I want to see you, of all people? \nMITCH (shrugging) I don't know. But it seems to me you must have gone to a lot of trouble to find out who I was, and where I lived and... \nMELANIE It was no trouble at all. I simply called my father's paper. Besides, I was coming up here anyway, I already told you... \nMITCH (grinning) You like me, huh? \nMELANIE I loathe you. You have no manners. And you're arrogant and conceited and... I wrote you a letter about it, in fact, but I tore it up. \nMITCH What did it say? \nMELANIE None of your business.

I come all the way up here to... \nMITCH But you were coming up anyway, remember? \nMELANIE I was! And all I get for my pains is a... a... a hole in the head! \nMITCH (grinning) Right next to the one you already had. \nMELANIE (angrily) Look, Mr. Brenner... \nLYDIA (O.S.) Mitch? \nThey turn toward the door. \nMED. SHOT - LYDIA BRENNER \nclosing the door behind her, coming toward the bar. She is a woman in her late forties, attractive, wearing shirt, blouse, cardigan sweater, low heels. There is nothing agrarian-looking about her. She speaks with the quick tempo of the city dweller, and there is lively inquiry in her eyes. \nLYDIA (puzzled) I thought I saw your car. What are you doing in town? \nMITCH (rising to greet her) I had to acknowledge a delivery. (grins) Mother, I'd like you to meet... \nLYDIA A what? \nMITCH (continuing) Melanie Daniels. Melanie, my mother. \nCLOSE SHOT - LYDIA \nHer eyebrows raising ever so slightly, not in displeasure, but simply in enormous curiosity as she acknowledge the introduction. \nLYDIA How do you do, Miss Daniels? (to Mitch) Acknowledge a what? \nBACK TO SCENE \nMITCH A delivery, Mother. Miss Daniels brought some birds from San Francisco. \nLydia thinks she understands. This is one of Mitch's San Francisco chippies. \nLYDIA Oh. I see. \nMITCH For Cathy. For her birthday. By the way, where is she? \nLYDIA Across at Brinkmeyer's. \nMITCH Miss Daniels is staying for the weekend.

We couldn't let you... \nLYDIA (understanding completely now) Lovebirds, I see. \nMITCH ...get away without thanking you in some small way.

SHOT - FROM MITCH'S AND MELANIE'S VIEWPOINT \nAnd past the heads of the other people who have also turned, we see one of the back windows of the Tides Restaurant has gone and gulls are coming in. Two or three of the men who are on the edge of the crowd turn and go back toward the window, beating them out. They succeed in doing this. \nCLOSE SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nThey turn from the gulls in the restaurant to look to the street. \nMITCH I think it's safe to get out now. \nMELANIE Don't let's take any chances. \nMITCH We've got to get Cathy. \nThey open the door and make their way out into the street, running and looking about them desperately. \nEXT.

The bay is silent. The gull spreads its wings to brake, and then sits on the water.

He is on the roof now, testing the two attic dormer windows. He turns to look out over the bay. \nLONG SHOT - THE BAY \ncovered with sitting gulls. In the distance, the town is still smoldering.

She is looking out over the bay when he comes to her. This is not the Melanie we saw at the beginning of the picture. Her hair is disarrayed, and her face and clothing are streaked with soot. But beyond a surface physical appearance, there is a weary wisdom in her eyes, and a strength to her as she stands looking toward the distant smoldering town. \nMELANIE The town looks clear. \nMITCH The bay doesn't. \nMELANIE How long have they been gathering there? \nMITCH The past fifteen minutes. (pause) It seems to be a pattern, doesn't it? They strike and disappear, and then they start massing again. \nMelanie nods. They are both silent, watching the bay. \nMELANIE I keep thinking of Annie.

A little smoke over the town, but otherwise... \nMELANIE (looking) Even the birds sitting out there. It does look very much the same, Mitch. This could be last week. \nMITCH It may not be last week again for a long long time. \nThey are both silent. \nMELANIE Look. They're still coming. \nMitch nods. Silence. \nMITCH Do you want to try your father again? (Melanie shakes her head.  Puzzled, Mitch looks at her) \nMELANIE I tried a little while ago.

A tremendous amount of static is coming from the radio as Mitch and Melanie join them \nLYDIA I can't get any of the local stations. I think this is San Francisco. \nANNOUNCER ...would include formulation of a central financing committee to handle credit and to allocate responsibility for the various facets of the project. A vote on the motion is expected early tomorrow morning. \nTWO SHOT - MELANIE AND MITCH \nlistening. \nANNOUNCER Continuing with the local news, police are still investigating the series of valuable jade burglaries in the Chinatown area. The round-up of known criminals has not as yet produced a suspect, but Commissioner Nelson said today he was certain the burglaries were quote linked and the work of the team of professionals unquote. (pause) In Bodega Bay early this morning, a large flock of crows attacked a group of children who were leaving the school during a fire drill. One little girl was seriously injured and taken to the hospital in Santa Rosa, but the majority of children reached safety in the town. (pause) On the national scene today, the opening of the new session of Congress was marked by a State of the Union address that... \nMITCH Is that all? \nANNOUNCER (O.S.) ...drew a standing ovation for the President. The Chief Executive, in discussing our relation to Europe and the rest of the world community said: \"These various elements of our foreign policy lead as I have said to a single goal -- \nMITCH (sighing) We're going to need more wood for the fire. We can't let it go out. \nANNOUNCER (continuing as drone in background) The goal of a peaceful world of free and independent states.  This is our guide for the present and our vision for the future -- a free community of nations, independent but interdependent, uniting north and south, east and west, in one great family of man, outgrowing and transcending the hates and fears that rend our age.  We will not reach that goal today or tomorrow.  We may not reach it in our lifetime.  But the quest is the great adventure of our century.  We sometimes chafe at the burdens of our obligations, the complexity of our decisions, the agony of our choices, but there is no comfort or security for us in evasion, no solution in abdication, no relief in irresponsibility. (pause) In assuming the tasks of the Presidency, I said that few generations, in all history, had been granted the role of being the great defender of freedom in its hour of maximum danger.  This is our good fortune, and I welcome it now as I did when I first took office. (pause) For it is the fate of this generation -- Of you in the Congress and of me as President -- to live with a struggle we did not start, in a world we did - not make. But the pressures of life are not always distributed by choice. And while no nation has ever faced such a challenge, no nation has ever been ready to seize the burden and the glory of... \nLYDIA (pause) Did you you get the windows in the attic, Mitch? \nMITCH I got them all, Mother. \n", "test3_id": 1697}

The storm has broken. The sea is calm. The sun is out. This is a huge ship. Walter's sitting on the bow, all by himself. His briefcase is beside him. It's quiet. He's looking out at the water, then (oddly) his cell phone rings. 
WALTER ...Hello? 
MAN'S VOICE Walter. 
WALTER Yeah. 
MAN'S VOICE Todd Mahar. From eHarmony. 
WALTER ...Oh. Hey. (like it's weird to be getting a call out here from Todd Mahar) Um, do I owe you guys money? Because your supervisor was clear I can't get my 400 dollars back. But I don't think I'm going to renew- 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR No, I just wanted to see how you were doing. You didn't sound great last time. 
WALTER The last time we talked? The time you told me I have no personality? 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Well, you know, you just left your application so empty. Share something about yourself. It doesn't have to be major league. (MORE) 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR (CONT'D) Life's full of small accomplishments. What do you strive to do everyday, that you take pride in? Can I ask you that? 
WALTER Well, I take my work seriously. Also keeping a tidy apartment. I help my sister out paying her bills now and then. But can we not list that? None of that stuff really seems like an accomplishment. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR You know there's a way to consider it where the tasks you accomplish (paying some of your sister's rent-- 
WALTER Braces. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR What's that? 
WALTER She hasn't asked me for rent money. For like a year. But I did pay for her braces. She's 36. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Well, taking care of yourself and your household, your mom, after you do that without ever failing, for a long time, hey that becomes an accomplishment. 
Some time passes. A bird flies by. 
WALTER I fought a dolphin. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Today? 
WALTER Yeah. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Aren't they supposed to be nice? 
WALTER They are. I think they're probably the best mammal. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR (meaning like aren't we THE BEST) We're mammals. 
Walter doesn't say anything about us being the best. Life's heavy for him right now. 
WALTER This mammal tried to protect me. And most of the other mammals I know, like the mammals at the office, they're dicks. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Why are you near dolphins? 
WALTER I'm on a ship. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Where? 
WALTER Near Greenland. I tracked a thumb here. To Nuuk, Greenland. I located the thumb. Now I'm fortunately going to Iceland to correct an oversight. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR Well, I'm going to tweak your profile, add "sailing" or whatever to your Done Thats. I'll put Swims with Dolphins, too. 
WALTER It was just one. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR I can really put Swims with Dolphin. That sounds like you have a pet dolphin you swim with everyday. Can I handle this please? It's my job. 
WALTER Okay, Todd. 
EHARMONY COUNSELOR You sound a little better? 
WALTER Do I? Because I think I'm a little worse. 
EXT. INTERNATIONAL SHIPPING FREIGHTER - DAY (LATER) 
Walter's been equipped with a kayak pole and life vest. Some of the crew assist him down a ladder to the ocean; others keep watch over a kayak waiting there. 
CAPTAIN (TO WALTER) It's a mile and half to Iceland. It's as far in as we can get with our hull size. 
WALTER So. Okay. I'm supposed to kayak in? 
CAPTAIN Reykjavik is due north. You'll be there by 9 am. 
EXT. ATLANTIC OCEAN - LATER

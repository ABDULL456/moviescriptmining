CARL Now, when you get up there, go ahead and hoist me up! Got it?! 
Russell continues to grunt and strain off screen. 
CARL You on the porch yet?! 
Russell is just inches above Carl, still STRUGGLING to climb. He slides down onto Carl's head, exhausted. 
CARL What? That's it?! I came all this way just to get stuck at the wrong end of this rock pile? Aw, great! 
Carl paces. 
RUSSELL Hey, if I could assist you over there, would you sign off on my badge? 
CARL What are you talking about? 
RUSSELL We could walk your house to the falls! 
CARL Walk it? 
RUSSELL Yeah, after all, we weigh it down. We could walk it right over there. Like a parade balloon. Carl considers this. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, ROCKY LANDSCAPE, DAY - LATER 
The house floats against the sky. The hose descends from the house and "Y"s to tie to both Carl and Russell. They wear the hose like a harness, pulling the house as they walk. 
CARL Now, we're gonna walk to the falls quickly and quietly, with no rap music or flash-dancing. Russell inspects his surroundings. 
RUSSELL 
(DISTRACTED) Uh-huh. 
CARL We have three days, at best, before the helium leaks out of those balloons. And if we're not at the falls when that happens... 
RUSSELL Sand! 
CARL ...we're not getting to the falls! 
RUSSELL I found sand! 
Carl ROLLS HIS EYES.    He looks up at the house. 
CARL Don't you worry, Ellie.    We'll get our house over there. Russell looks up at the house.   Who's Carl talking to? 
RUSSELL Huh. (shrugs it off) This is fun already, isn't it? By the time we get there, you're gonna feel so assisted... Oh, Mr. Fredricksen, if we happen to get separated, use the Wilderness Explorer call. Caw caw, raaar!! 
The WILDERNESS EXPLORER CALL sets off Carl's hearing aid. 
RUSSELL Wait. Why are we going to Paradise Falls again? 
CARL Hey, let's play a game. It's called: "See who can be quiet the longest." 
RUSSELL Cool!   My mom loves that game! 
They head toward Paradise Falls, some 10 miles away. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, JUNGLE CLEARING - DAY 
Mist hangs ominously over a rocky landscape. Something tall blasts through a maze of rocks. 
Two dark shapes are chasing the prey.   Each has a light. Hunters. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, GROVE OF TREES - CONTINUOUS 
The prey dodges various TRAPS, one after another. A metal cage slams shut, a hidden net, darts on a trip wire. 
The prey runs into a clearing surrounded by rocks: a dead end. 
EXT. MOUNTAIN, CLEARING - CONTINUOUS 
The hunters surround the prey, stepping out into the light: a sinister Doberman Pinscher, a Rottweiler, and a bulldog, each wearing large, HIGH-TECH COLLARS. 
They surround the prey.   Escape looks impossible. WOOSH! The bird moves impossibly fast, jumping over the three dogs and escaping in a flash. 
The dogs head off in pursuit. A HIGH PITCHED SQUEAL stops the dogs short, their ears wincing in pain. They whimper and run off.

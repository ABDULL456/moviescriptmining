They gather round. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER ... an important announcement. News has just been received through the BBC that Great Britain, having had no reply... (static) ...and therefore has declared war on Nazi Germany... (a collective gasp) ... next few hours... awaiting latest news... 
Henryk hits the set. 
RADIO ANNOUNCER ... but France is expected to make a similar announcement... (static) ... Poland is no longer alone. 
The Polish national anthem plays. All are still. 
INT. WARSAW APARTMENT - NIGHT 
Father pours liqueur into glasses. 
The family are seated around the dining table, having just finished a meal. The table groans with the remains of the dinner. Szpilman has a plaster over his cut. 
HENRYK (lighting up a cigarette) Mama, that was a great dinner. 
SZPILMAN It certainly was. 
MOTHER When there's something to celebrate, you've got to make an effort. 
The glasses are handed round. 
FATHER Here's to Great Britain and France. 
They all clink glasses and drink. 
FATHER I told you. Didn't I tell you? All will be well. 
EXT. RUINED WARSAW STREET - DAY 
A column of German Soldiers, led by an officer on horseback, march into view. 
On the sidewalk of the street, with its buildings in ruins, smoke still rising, stand onlookers, including Szpilman and Henryk, and a little behind them, Father, craning to see. They watch, expressionless, as the Germans march past. 
INT. WARSAW APARTMENT - DAY 
Regina is opening and closing the window, examining the frame with her fingers. Halina is on a box, removing and replacing books. Mother sits at one end of the table, polishing a man's watch and chain. At the other end, Father sits counting a small stack of notes and coins. Henryk is deep in thought and Szpilman is fiddling with his father's violin. The apartment has less furniture now and the silver has gone. 
FATHER (finishing the counting) Five thousand and three. 
MOTHER Is that all? 
FATHER Yes, five thousand and three zlotys, that's all we've got left. 
REGINA It's three thousand and three zlotys too much, (reading from newspaper) 'Re: Further restrictions regarding liquid assets: Jews will be allowed to keep a maximum of two thousand zlotys in their homes.' 
MOTHER What are we supposed to do with the rest? 
HALINA Deposit it in a bank. Blocked account. 
HENRYK Banks? Who'd be stupid enough to deposit money in a German bank? 
REGINA We could hide the money here in the window frame. 
FATHER No, no, no. I'll tell you what we'll do. We'll use tried and tested methods. You know what we did in the last war? We made a hole in the table leg and we hid the money in there. 
HENRYK And suppose they take the table away? 
MOTHER What d'you mean, take the table away? 
HENRYK The Germans go into Jewish homes and they just take what they want, furniture, valuables, anything. 
MOTHER Do they? 
FATHER Idiot! What would they want with a table? 
All look at the table: it's covered in stains and the veneer is coming away at one end. A table like this? 
He pokes his finger under the veneer. It snaps, revealing bare wood beneath. 
MOTHER What on earth are you doing? 
HALINA There's a good place under the cupboard. 
HENRYK No, no. Listen, I've been thinking --

He turns from the window. 
FERRIS Parents always fall for the clammy hands. It's physical evidence of illness. It's a good, non-specific symptom. Parents are generally pretty hip to the fever scams. And to make them work you have to go a hundred and one, hundred and two. You get a nervous mother and you end up in a doctor's office and that's worse than school. 
He flips on his stereo and fills the room with the MTV broadcast. A NEW SONG begins. 
FERRIS Fake a stomach cramp and when you're doubled over, moaning and wailing, just lick your palms. It's a little stupid and childish but then so if high school. Right? 
He equalizes the sound a little. 
FERRIS This is my ninth sick day with semester. If I go for ten, I'm probably going to have to barf up a lung. So, I absolutely must make this one count. 
He exits into the hallway. 
11  INT. BATHROOM                                                11 
Ferris walks into the bathroom. It's littered with Jean's debris. He turns on the shower water. 
FERRIS I don't care if you're fifty five or seven, everybody needs a day off now and then. It's a beautiful day. How can I be expected to handle high school? 
He bends down OUT OF FRAME as he loses his briefs. He pops up. 
FERRIS I do actually have a test. That wasn't bullshit. 
He steps into the shower. Through the pebbled glass of the shower door we see Ferris' outline. 
FERRIS That I care about it was. 
12  INT. BATHROOM. SHOWER STALL.                                 12 
Inside the shower. Ferris' hair is standing straight up. It's moulded into a fin with shampoo. 
FERRIS It's on European socialism. I mean, really. What's the point? I'm not European. I don't plan to be European. So, who gives a shit if they're socialists? They could be fascist anarchists and it still wouldn't change the fact that I don't own a car. 
He turns the shower head around and uses it like a microphone. 
FERRIS (sings) WELL SHAKE IT UP, BABY, TWIST AND SHOUT... 
13  INT. HALLWAY. LATER                                          13 
Ferris comes out of the bathroom with a towel wrapped around his waist. He's drying his hair with another of a different color. 
FERRIS Not that I condone fascism. Or and "isms". "Isms", in my opinion are not good. A person should not believe in an "ism". He should believe in himself. John Lennon said it on his first solo album. "I don't believe in Beatles, I just believe in me." A good point there. Afterall, he was the Walrus. 
He opens a linen closet and tosses the towel in it. 
FERRIS I could be the Walrus and I'd still have to bum rides off people. 
He passes CAMERA and goes into his room. 
FERRIS (OC) I'm not very political? Let me put that into perspective... 
14  INT. BEDROOM                                                 14 
Ferris tosses the towel he's dried hair with on the bed. 
FERRIS My uncle went to Canada to protest the war, right? On the Fourth of July he was down with my aunt and he got drunk and told my Dad he felt guilty he didn't fight in Viet Nam. So I said, "What's the deal, Uncle Jeff? In wartime you want to be a pacifist and in peacetime you want to be a soldier. It took you twenty years to find out you don't believe in anything?" (snaps his fingers) Grounded. Just like that. Two weeks. (pause) Be careful when you deal with old hippies. They can be real touchy. 
He opens his door. 
15  INT. CLOSET                                                  15 
The door opens and Ferris rifles through his shirts. 
FERRIS My mother was a hippie. But she lost it. She got old. If she listens to the White Album now? She doesn't hear music, she hears memories. Nostalgia is her favorite drug. It'll probably be mine, too. I hope not. 
He finds a shirt he likes. He steps back from the closet and puts it on. He drops the towel. 
16  INT. BEDROOM                                                 16 
He walks across the room to his dresser. He opens his underwear drawer. There's an old model of a submarine on the top of the dresser. He picks it up. 
FERRIS In eighth grade a friend of mine made a bong out of one of these. The smoke tasted like glue. 
He pulls out a pair of underwear. He gets dressed as he speaks. 
FERRIS His name is Garth Volbeck. He's a serious outsider. Not a bad guy, I like him. I'm probably his only friend. I do what I can for him. I mean, if I was him, I'd appreciate it. Do unto others, right? Anyway, his mother owns a gas station. His father's dead and his sister's rumored to be a prostitute, which is complete bullshit. She only puts out so people will hang out with her. It's sad but I don't hold it against her. Better to hold it against the guys who use her and don't care about her. (pause) My parents never allowed Garth over here. It was because of his family. Mainly his older brother. He's in jail. I could see them not wanting his brother here because he is a registered psycho. I wouldn't want him here. I once watched the guy eat a whole bowl of artificial fruit just so he could see what it was like to have his stomach pumped. But Garth isn't his brother. It isn't his fault that his brother's screwed-up. Alot of fights with the parents on that point. I always felt for Garth. I was sleeping at his house once and I was laying on the dark worrying that his brother was going to come in and hack me to death with an ax and I heard Garth crying. I asked him what was wrong and he said, "Nothing". ... Nothing was wrong. There was no specific thing he was crying about. In fact, he wasn't really even aware that he was crying. He just cried himself to sleep every night. It was a habit. The guy's so conditioned to grief that if he doesn't feel it, he can't sleep. How could you possibly dump on guy who has to deal with that kinda shit? My parents acknowledge the trudge of the situation and I'm sure that deep down, they do feel for him but still the guy's banned from our house. 
He looks at himself in the mirror on the back of his closet door. He doesn't like what he's wearing. He continues his speech as he disrobes. 
FERRIS Unfortunately, now my parents have a legit argument. Garth doesn't need his brother to give him a rep anymore. He's getting one on his own. He's lost. It's over for him. He's eighteen. Gone from school. Gone from life. His legacy is a gas station. 
17  INT. HOUSE. STAIRCASE                                        17 
Ferris comes down the stairs. He's wearing a completely different outfit. 
FERRIS One very serious danger is playing sick is that it's possible to believe your own act. 
18  INT. KITCHEN                                                 18 
Ferris comes into the kitchen and crosses to the refrigerator. 
FERRIS That and boredom. Alot of people ditch and feel great for about an hour. Then they realize there's nothing to do. TV and food. I myself have ditched and gotten so bored I did homework. Figure that shit out. 
He takes a sip out of a bottle of orange juice. 
FERRIS You have to plan things out before you take the day off. Otherwise you get all nervous worrying about what to do and all you get is grief and the whole point is to take it easy, cut loose and enjoy. 
He crosses to the pantry. 
FERRIS You blow your day and at about three o'clock, when everybody's out of school, you're going to wish you'd gone to school so you could be out having fun. 
He emerges from the pantry with a handful of Oreos. 
FERRIS Avoid the misery. Plan your day. Do it right.

GRAHAM I held him in my lap in the back seat as we drove to the hospital. I couldn't stop crying... We need to go into the basement now. 
Graham gestures for the kids to come to the stairs.  Morgan and Bo move to their father slowly. 
GRAHAM You know what your Uncle Merrill did right after the doctor put his arm back in place?  He jumped off the table and gave me a hug.  He had already forgotten that I was the one who hurt him. 
Graham ushers the two children down the stairs.  He waits for Merrill.  Merrill turns from the kitchen door and walks toward him.  Merrill stops and looks down the stairs. 
MERRILL We won't be able to get out of there. 
GRAHAM I'm sorry I hurt your arm. 
Beat.  Merrill's eyes fill with water.  He doesn't look up at his older brother. 
MERRILL I know. 
Merrill walks down the stairs.  Graham waits at the top.  He watches the kitchen door with the table and chairs against it.  Beat. 
THERE IS MOVEMENT OUTSIDE IN THE HALL. 
The door starts to force its way open.  THE TABLE AND CHAIRS BEGIN TO SCRAPE ACROSS THE KITCHEN FLOOR LIKE NAILS AGAINST A CHALK BOARD. 
WE HEAR VOICE-LIKE SOUNDS ENTER THE KITCHEN.  SOUNDS MADE FROM INHALES, NOT EXHALES. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  BASEMENT - EVENING 
Graham comes down the last few steps and enters the basement. 
MORGAN We forgot our foil helmets! 
Graham closes the door behind him.  It has no lock. 
GRAHAM We need something to wedge against the doorknob. 
The basement is lined with metal shelves.  The shelves are cluttered with all sorts of canned goods, extension cords, cleaning supplies, decorations, outdoor tools.  Merrill rummages through the shelves frantically. 
MORGAN They'll read our minds! 
GRAHAM You're scaring your sister. 
BO I'm already scared. 
Graham puts his ear to the door and listens. 
GRAHAM Merrill -- 
MERRILL I'm looking! 
Merrill moves to another set of shelves.  He starts knocking things to the ground. 
MORGAN (to himself) They'll know our secret thoughts. 
There is SCRATCHING AGAINST THE DOOR.  The doorknob turns. Graham grabs it with both hands.  The door begins to push open. 
GRAHAM Merrill! 
MERRILL Got it! 
Merrill reaches between two stacks of shelves and pulls out a pick for digging in the ground.  He holds it up in the air. It has a three-foot wooden handle. 
Merrill turns and rushes in Graham's direction. 
A single light bulb hangs from a wire in the ceiling.  It is the only light in the room.  Merrill CLIPS THE LIGHT BULB with the end of the wooden handle as he crosses the room. 
THE BULB SHATTERS. 
THE BASEMENT IS INSTANTLY BLACK. 
BO Dad! 
WE HEAR THE SOUNDS OF SUDDEN COMMOTION, VOICES.  STRUGGLING AT THE DOOR.  STEPS ON BROKEN GLASS. 
CLICK.  A BEAM OF A FLASHLIGHT COMES ON. 
IT ILLUMINATES MORGAN STANDING NEXT TO A RACK OF METAL SHELVES.  HE TURNS THE FLASHLIGHT IN HIS TINY HANDS. 
THE NARROW BEAM MOVES ACROSS THE DARKNESS.  IT FINDS MERRILL AND GRAHAM LEANING UP AGAINST THE BASEMENT DOOR.

Claude leans down to help her. The boy leaps on Claude. They both crash to the ground and roll through the grass. 
CLAUDE Get him off me. Ingrid! 
Ingrid hesitates then runs toward the house. 
Claude wrestles with the boy. The boy growls. He grabs hold of Claude's arms and sinks his teeth into Claude's shoulder. 
CLAUDE Ayy!     Help me! 
Claude kicks and yanks himself free.     He runs wildly. 
Close on Claude.    Tears stream down.   He coughs and spits. 
55   INT. HOUSE - SAME                                               55 
Claude bursts through the front door. Ingrid sees Claude and runs to the kitchen. Margot, in a suit, goes over notes. 
MARGOT Woa, don't run so fast. CLAUDE There's a boy! He bit me! MARGOT (alarmed) Who bit you? CLAUDE A boy.    A Vogler!   Where's Ingrid? 
MARGOT Let me see. 
He tilts his head, she leans down and looks at his neck. There are red and purple bite marks. 
MARGOT (rising) I'm calling the police. 
Claude grabs her arm. 
CLAUDE No, don't! It'll get worse. Why did you say anything to them? 
MARGOT Claude, this isn't my fault. 
CLAUDE That boy bit me because you couldn't keep your fat mouth shut. 
MARGOT Claude, you're being a jerk. 
CLAUDE You shit in your shoes and then you fuck them! 
Margot smacks Claude in the face.   Ingrid stares wide eyed. 
56   INT. BOOKSTORE - DAY                                         56 
A placard reads: A Conversation with Margot Zeller and Dick Koosman. People mull about with drinks. Pauline and Claude admire the display of Margot's books. 
PAULINE You really want to know? I'll tell you. She wrote a story about Lenny and me. (flips through pages) Yeah, it's in here. I mean we were talking almost every day at this point and there was no warning. Maybe a couple of remarks that she'd used some things of ours... Then The New Yorker comes -- we have a subscription -- and there's the story and... It's things we said and did -- stuff I told her in confidence. (MORE) 
PAULINE (CONT'D) I think it helped end our marriage. I read it and thought, "She hates me." 
CLAUDE She doesn't hate you. 
Pauline stares at a blown up author photo of her sister. 
PAULINE You think? Margot tried to murder me when we were girls. She put me on a baking sheet, sprinkled me with paprika and put me in the oven. 
57   CUT TO:                                                      57 
The crowd files in.   Margot and Dick stand in a corner. 
MARGOT Jim was here. 
Dick flips through some notes. 
DICK Is Jim still writing?

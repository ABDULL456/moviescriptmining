{"test1_input": "ERNIE Call me old-fashioned, but I'll go with Paul Lynde. \nJULIE Don't be an idiot. \nThey argue back and forth, hitting and poking each other 3 Stooges style. Juan turns to Rick. \nJUAN You see, Rick? Just because we're freaks doesn't mean we can't have some fun, huh? \nRick is overwhelmed by it all. He backs away. \nRICK Get away from me. Get away! I'm not like you. You hear me? I'm Ricky Coogan! I AM NOT A FREAK! \nThe Freaks laugh in Rick's face. He storms off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nANOTHER AREA OF THE FREAK HOUSE--A LITTLE LATER \nRick sits in a corner, pondering his fate. Oddly, there's a shiny new Pepsi machine in this dingy corner of the Freak House. JulieErnie approach him. \nERNIE Okay Coog, so I get twenty four hour access to T `n' A, and you look like a plate of rancid giblets. We're still pals, right? \nRick shoots him a look. \nJULIE All the freaks have gone through this anguish, Rick. At first, I was blinded by my anger. I admit it. I wanted to break your neck for getting me into this. But I got over it. Juan taught me to channel my anger for the common good. \nRICK It was your fault, anyway. You wanted to see the freak show. \nJULIE (FURIOUS) I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP! \nShe tries to wring his neck. Ernie helps. Rick glares at Ernie. \nRICK Ernie! \nERNIE Oh... Sorry, Coog. For a second there, I was a total man-hater. Weird. \nJulie regains her cool. She takes out a pamphlet, scribbles something on it, and hands it to Rick. \nJULIE Here. Take it. \nRick examines the cover. He reads it aloud. \nRICK \"So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak-- Now What?\" \nThere's an \"8\" scribbled on the pamphlet. \nJULIE we're in cubicle eight. Maybe later you'll be ready to talk. \nRICK Forget it. Not me. I'm not like those other god-forsaken animals. \nHe throws the-pamphlet to the ground, just as the Worm, Bearded Lady, and Sockhead approach. They sit down in a circle around him. The Worm looks down at the pamphlet and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe. \nWORM You're mistaken, Rick. You are exactly like us. We were all normal healthy folk before we made the fateful mistake of visiting this hell hole at an off hour. Why, when I first came here... \nWAVY FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FREAK COMPOUND - THE PAST \nThe Worm, as an OXFORD PROFESSOR, is wandering around the grounds, taking notes and puffing on his pipe. \nWORM (V.O.) I was a professor of lacrophylogy-- er, the study of worms, of course. I came in search of the Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman terms, the fat pudgy worm. Mr. Skuggs said he had just such a worm in his shed. How could I have surmised that the specimen and I would ultimately prove to be one and the same? \nWe see professor Worm meet Elijah, and follow him into the lab. The smoke stack belches a plume of flames as we hear his off-camera screams. DISSOLVE back to.. \nTHE FREAK HOUSE--NOW \nThe Worm finishes his tale. \nWORM At first, the transformation was fabulous. I truly understood the worm's ethos like never before. But those early days of fascination are over. Now, in retrospect, I think the whole thing is a fucking headache. I'd sell my soul just to be able to wipe my own ass... \nHe sniffles a little, but manages to hold back the tears. We pan to Sockhead. \nSOCKHEAD I first came here as a tourist, looking for some fun... \n", "test1_true": "EXT. FREAKLAND - THEN \nA lanky TOURIST, obviously Sockhead in better days. He approaches Elijah. \nSOCKHEAD (V.O.) Anyway, then Elijah turned me into a sock. That's it. \nINT. FREAK HOUSE - NOW \nSockhead shrugs apologetically. \nSOCKHEAD Sorry. I'm not much for stories. \nThe camera moves in on the BEARDED LADY. \nBEARDED LADY When I arrived here, I was nothing like I am now. \nFLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FREAKLAND - THEN \nThe bearded lady (as a man) steps out of the cab of his eighteen-wheeler. He looks very much like he does now, except he has no lipstick or earrings. \nBEARDED LADY (V.O.) I was confused--a walking contradiction, so full of questions. \nINT. FREAK HOUSE - NOW \nHe finishes his story. \nBEARDED LADY/MAN Now I know who I am. I can say, \"Hey world. This is me. I'm a woman. And I like me.\" \nThe others look at the bearded man uneasily. The camera pans past the Bearded Lady, and moves in on an ordinary HAMMER lying on the ground. \nFLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HARDWARE STORE - DAY \nHappy music. The hammer is placed on a shelf by a friendly STOCKBOY. The music turns tense as Elijah appears and scans the shelf. He makes eye contact with the hammer, and smiles. He grabs the hammer roughly and shoves it in a plastic bag. Darkness. \nEXT. FREAKLAND - THEN \nThe bag opens, Elijah reaches in and takes out the hammer. The music turns to Psycho-like string stabs as Elijah uses the hammer to smash in a nail. \nINT. FREAK HOUSE - NOW \nEveryone looks at the hammer sympathetically. Rick turns away to wipe a tear from his eye. \nWORM You are one of us now, Rick. Whether you admit it or not. It's irrefutable. \nRICK Yeah. Says you. \nThe worm shakes his head. The freaks turn and head back to their cubicles. Rick exchanges a look with Julie before she and Ernie turn and head off. \nRick is left alone, staring pensively at the hammer. \nTIME DISSOLVE TO: \nHours later, Rick is still staring at the hammer. He picks it up and stares at it more closely. \nTIME DISSOLVE TO: \nHours later. Rick is still staring at the damn hammer. He nods with resolve. \nRICK (TO HAMMER) You're right. \nHe spots the pamphlet on the ground, picks it up, dusts it off. He opens it and begins to read, under the heading \"1. It's Fun Being Ugly!\"... \nRick closes the pamphlet, looks at the number \"8\" Julie scribbled, and nods with a sense of purpose. Standing up, he throws the hammer carelessly aside into the muck, and walks towards the cubicles. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FREAK HOUSE - DAY \nRick walks past the cubicles. In one, the Bearded Lady knits a sweater... He reaches cubicle 8, and is about to speak when he hears Julie giggling. There is a man's voice, but not Ernie's. It's Juan. \n", "test1_id": 339, "test2_input": "KEVIN (CHUCKLES SNIDELY) I'm saying you're ugly enough to burn the nosehairs off a dead nun. \nThe crowd bursts into cruel hysterics, pointing mockingly at Rick. Even Alistair Cooke is practically choking with laughter. \nALISTAIR COOKE AH-HA-HA-HA! WHAT A PUTZ! \nRick looks around, horrified at the sea of evil, jeering faces. He begins to tremble. Then... \nRICK'S MONSTER EYE \nsprings to life for the first time and glows red with rage. His whole monster side awakens and takes charge of his body with violent intensity. He grabs Kevin's head and screams in a new, monstrous voice. \nRICK EAT SHIT! \nPOP! He plucks Kevin's head off his neck and holds it aloft. The head stares down at Rick in disbelief. \nKEVIN'S HEAD Now you're just being childish. \nRick serves the head like a volleyball, smashing it to bits. The crowd panics and charges for the exits. \nCROWD AHHHHHH! HELP! LET US OUT OF HERE! \nPeople are trampling over each other in the mayhem. Alistair Cooke is crushed under the stampede. \nThe freaks are horrified. Monster Rick growls triumphantly. Elijah looks on, intrigued. \nELIJAH Now that's entertainment. \nINT. FREAK HOUSE - MORNING \nRick awakens with a start and gets up. He approaches JulieErnie, The Bearded Lady, Nosey and Dog Boy, who are idly playing a game of \"Wheel of Fortune.\" The cubicles contain large blank blocks, like the \"letters\" on the game show. So far, there's a \"D\", two \"S\"s, and a \"K\" revealed. Rosie the Pinhead plays Vanna White's role. \nNOSEY I'd like to buy a vowel. \nThe Bearded lady yawns. Rick edges towards them. \nRICK Hey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in? \nJuan advances towards Rick, sneering. \nJUAN So. Now you don't mind mixing with us--how did you say it--sorry mutants? \nRICK Look! I'm sorry for what happened at the show. Can't you just forget it? \nHe shakes his finger at Juan, and notices there's still a human nose stuck on his monster claw. He wipes it off, embarrassed. There's an awkward pause. Ernie breaks the silence. \nERNIE Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about your big escape plan? \nJuan gives Ernie a nasty \"shut up\" look. He growls at him. \nERNIE Well, excuse me for living. \nRICK You have an escape plan? \nJUAN Listen, Beast Boy, the games are a simple diversion. (MORE) JUAN(CONT'D) Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks cry out for freedom! Aooooooorrraaaagh! \nJuan howls lustily. He looks to rest of the freaks. They're a pathetic lot, and their half-hearted howl proves it. \nFREAKS Aoo... \nBeat. \nJULIE Juan's plan is really ingenious Rick. See, he figured out that-- \nJUAN I figured out that our escape does not include the Beast Boy. No one may discuss the plan with him, understand? \nJuan gives the others a threatening look. They mumble agreement. \nRICK What's the matter with all of you? You trust your lives to a guy just 'cause he can lick his own privates? \nThe freaks ponder this a second, then nod \"yes\". \nERNIE You gotta admit, Coog, it's a helluva trick. \n", "test2_true": "JUAN Haha! I have spent a year studying this hellhole, devising the perfect escape. You think you'll just tango right out the door!? Ha! Just try it, amigo. \nRICK I will! \nRick turns to go. JulieErnie rush over and try to reason with him quietly. \nJULIE Rick, wait. \nERNIE Yeah. Don't go off half-cocked. Believe me, it ain't all it's cracked up to be. \nJULIE This isn't one of your dumb movies, Coogan. Look, Juan's a good dog, a smart dog. I'll talk to him. Don't be stupid, Rick. You can't do it without us. \nRICK Forget it! I don't need you, EES, or anybody else! I'll get out of here all by myself, you... you.,. crud sucking pus monkeys! \nDING DING DING! The letters in the Wheel of Fortune board light up, and ROSIE turns them over to reveal \"Crud Sucking Pus Monkeys\" as the secret phrase. Everyone claps despite themselves. Juan stares them down. They stop. \nRick storms off in a huff. Juan takes Julie's hand and gazes deep into her eyes. He kisses her passionately. Julie is watching Rick leave. Juan nibbles her neck, which gets her attention. She scratches Juan behind his ear. His leg instinctively kicks the air. Ernie looks worried. \nERNIE I'm getting a bad feeling here. \nCUT TO: \nINT. REAR CORNER OF FREAK HOUSE - DAY \nOut of sight from the others, Rick approaches the rear door and tries it. It doesn't open from the inside. \nRICK Damn. \nHe peers out through a crack in the door and sees a MILKMAN getting out of his truck in the driveway. \nRICK (TO MILKMAN) Psst! Hey, you. Milkman! \nOUTSIDE \nThe milkman looks over at the outhouse, suspicious. \nMILKMAN Yeah... ? \nRICK (V.0.) Just the man I'm lookinq for. Be a pal, and give me a hand will ya? \nMILKMAN Oooh no! I know you freaks. You'll try anything just to get someone to open that door. Well not me! Ha! \nHe's about to walk away. \nRICK Okay. Guess I'll just have to milk the world's biggest breasted woman all by myself. Sorry to bother you. \nThe milkman stops in his tracks. He tiptoes over to the back door of the outhouse, listening intently as Rick goes into his \"act.\" \nRICK (in a lusty womanish VOICE) Ooohh... Milk me! Milk me now! Milk me hard! (Normal Rick voice) I've only got two hands, all right? Geez. I don't care if Elijah did give you skim milk on the right side, chocolate on the left, and eggnog in the middle. \nThe milkman is salivating at the door. \nMILKMAN (TO HIMSELF) Gee, I love eggnog! \nThe milkman opens the door eagerly and steps inside. Beat. \nMILKMAN Hey, what the-- \nBONK. We hear the sound of bottled buttermilk beaning his soft noggin. Rick walks out wearing the milkman outfit complete with the little six-milk-bottle-carrier thing. \nHe looks around and heads for the milk truck, whistling casually. He notices something. It's ... \nTHE GIANT ELIJAH HEAD \nIts big eyes are staring at Rick (note: there's a skywriter plane in the distance behind the head, which finishes writing \"YOU GOT THE RIGHT ONE BABY: PEPSI\") Rick gets to the truck and tries the door. It's locked. \nRICK Shit. \nHe looks over at the giant head. The eyes are still staring at him--they seem to have shifted. Rick shrugs it off and looks around. He walks over to Elijah's car. It's locked too. He checks the big eyes. They've moved again. \nRick's getting a bit desperate. He sees something else and runs towards it. It's a dry-docked motorboat. It's locked too. The eyes have followed Rick again. He sees something else and runs over to it. It's a bag of golf clubs leaning against Elijah's porch. They're locked too. \nRICK Damn! This guy doesn't trust anybody! \n", "test2_id": 340, "test3_input": "flips Stuey onto the ground and starts stomping on him. Stuey is knocked out cold. Rick leaves him on the floor and stalks the freak cage murderously. \nRICK MONSTER NOW I RIP FREAKS TO PIECES! \nJIMIE No! We're your friends! \nRICK MONSTER Oh. NOW I RIP FRIENDS TO PIECES! \nHe rips some bars off the cage and is about to spear JulieErnie with a jagged steel bar when Stuey Monster grabs his leg and trips him. Stuey summons all his remaining energy to wrestle Rick, delaying him, for the moment, from slaughtering the freaks. \nMeanwhile, Elijah is watching as \nTHE EES BLOB \nsolidifies into... A GIANT SHOE made of living flesh. It's got eyeballs where the eyes should be, a tongue where the tongue should be, but it's helpless and immobile. \nElijah looks at it with pride. He does his best Ed Sullivan IMPRESSION: \nELIJAH Now that's a really, really big shoe. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmmm, I think I'd like a pair of those! \nHe swivels the nozzle turret towards the cage full of freaks and is about to glop them when Rick stands up above Stuey, blocking Elijah's trajectory at the freak cage. Rick raises the jagged bar above Stuey, ready to drive it down through his chest. \nELIJAH (to Rick monster) Would you hurry up and waste the troll, please!? I got a lonely shoe over here! \nRick Monster nods and drives the spear down when we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. REGIS & KATHIE LEE SHOW SET \nRick's silhouette (which matches his ten foot monster incarnation) is immersed in the story. \nRICK And then... \nKATHIE LEE Sorry to interrupt Rick, but you've been talking for almost ninety minutes, and we've just got to go to a commercial. \nRICK Sorry. \nREGIS We'll be right back after this, folks. \nCUT TO: \nPRODUCT SHOT \nA fine array of different kinds of cheese on a chopping block. \nTOUGH VOICED ANNCR You like cheese. You like being a man. That's why you like.. \nA BURLY HAND swipes all the cheese off the block and slams down an aluminum can labeled \"MACHEESMO.\" \nTOUGH VOICED ANNCR Macheesemo. Real cheese for real men. Now in a handy aluminum dispenser. \nThe hand crushes the can and gooey yellow cheese squirts out the top. \nCUT TO: \nINT. REGIS & KATHIE LEE SHOW SET \nWe hear a music bite from \"Le Freak.\" \nKATHIE LEE And now back to the exciting conclusion of Ricky Coogan's incredible story. \nRICK Well, let's see, the other freaks were lined up in Elijah's sights, and I was about to shove a pipe through Stuey's skull, when all of a sudden, I heard a voice... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CARNIVAL TENT - NIGHT \nRick stops the spear inches from Stuey's chest. Their eyes meet. \nELIJAH Kill him! Kill him! \nElijah's bloodthirsty goading fades away, and Cowboy's voice reverberates in Rick's head. \n", "test3_true": "The voice keeps echoing. A tear wells up in Rick Monster's eye. He looks over at Cowboy, who is actually calling out to him from the cage. \nCOWBOY Your heart... your heart... your heart... \nRick Monster loses his murderous glare. He breaks into a warm smile, throws the pipe away and helps Stuey Monster up. They hug. The rest of the Freaks cheer wildly. \nERNIE Atta' boy Coog! (NUDGES WORM) Hey, ain't that somethin'? \nThe Worm is gushing sentimentally. He tries to hide his tears. \nWORM Tosh. (Sniff) Sentimental claptrap (Sniff) Shameless, maudlin--Baaa! \nHe can't hold it in anymore. He bawls like a baby. Meanwhile, Elijah is hopping mad. \nELIJAH Cut the lovey-dovey bullshit, and start mutilating each other! \nHe aims at Rick Monster and presses the fire button. The Glop starts to flow, but before it can make it out of the tip, Rick grabs hold of the nozzle, and twists it around to face Elijah. \nRICK Raarrrrrrgh! \nElijah manages to duck just in time. A stream of yellow Noxon 25 glop flies over his shoulder, and lands in the DUNK TANK full of carbolic acid that sits off to one side of the tent. \nThe acid and the Noxon mix together and bubble up menacingly. \nElijah hops down out of the gunner's chair and squares off against Rick Monster. \nMeanwhile, Stuey Monster has released the other freaks from the cage. They watch the confrontation from a distance. \nElijah rolls up his sleeves. Rick growls and advances slowly. \nELIJAH You think I made you strong? HA! I've cranked my DNA up so high, you won't know what hit you. I'm a wrecking machine! Aaaaaaa! \nHe rushes at Rick and delivers a flurry of punches to his mid section. They have absolutely no effect. Rick brings one heavy fist slamming down on Elijah's head, stopping him cold. \nELIJAH (WEAKLY) Ow! I think you crushed my spinal cord. I can't feel anything in my fingers. \nRICK Maybe you'll feel this ... \nRick rears back to kick him. \nELIJAH Qait--if you kill me, you'll never find the antidote. \nThe freaks all perk up. Rick's skeptical. \nRICK What antidote? \nELIJAH A time release serum--I baked it into a delicious batch of macaroons. \nA slow smile grows on the Freaks' faces, especially Rick's. \nRICK If you ask me, you skimped on the coconut! \nTHWAK! Rick boots Elijah between the legs, sending him flying through the air. He lands on the DUNK TANK SEAT over the bubbling Noxon/Acid. Dazed, he looks at the bullseye target, and back at Rick. Summoning up his last ounce of bravado, Elijah makes a last stand. \nELIJAH Come on, Coogan! Come oooon! You haven't got the guts to kill me! Go on! I dare ya'! \nRick ponders for a second. He looks over to Julie. Then... \nSCRAPPY Yap! Yap! \nRICK Scrappy! \nScrappy the dog rushes in. He leaps up and presses the bullseye, dropping Elijah into the hideous mixture. \nELIJAH AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHH! \nElijah struggles in agony. His body bubbles and mutates in the thick toxic soup. He sinks lower and lower into the gunk, until he and his cries are buried for good. \nScrappy leaps into Rick's arms and licks his face. \nSCRAPPY Yap! \nRICK Atta boy, Scrap! \n", "test3_id": 341}

{"train": "FREAKED \nWritten by \nTim Burns, Tom Stern & Alex Winter \nSEVENTH DRAFT January 12, 1992 \nINT. REGIS & KATHIE LEE SHOW SET \nA horribly deformed figure--hunchback, misshapen head--sits on a stool in complete silhouette. This is RICK COOGAN. \nRICK Can you imagine it, Regis, Kathie Lee? One day I'm a hot young movie star, and the next day I'm a hideous mutant freak, covered with festering lesions. \nOddly, REGIS and KATHIE LEE are also in complete silhouette. \nREGIS Sounds like my wife when she misses a mudpack! \nThe audience CRACKS UP. Kathie Lee pooh-poohs Regis. \nKATHIE LEE Oh Regis! You're incorrigible! Ha- ha! (to Rick, she turns EARNEST) Ricky, once you were the all- American boy next door, star of the beloved Hey Dude films. Now the very mention of your name makes children scream in terror. We've all read about your disturbing story. But the people want to hear it from you, Ricky Coogan. (SFX: children scream) Won't you tell us your story? \nRICK Well, it's kinda long, but okay. It all started when I signed a deal to be spokesman for the E.E.S. conglomerate... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. E.E.S. CONFERENCE ROOM - DAY \nThe E.E.S. logo--a large metal shoe with a bar across it, with the words \"Everything Except Shoes\" beneath. Widen to reveal RICHARD HERTZ, president of E.E.S., smiling rigidly to camera. RICK COOGAN is next to him, also holding a stiff movie-star smile. FLASH! They shake hands as the EES photographer takes publicity shots. Off to one side, behind Hertz, are several EES EXECUTIVES. Behind Rick is his entourage: LAWYER, BODYGUARD, TRAINER, STYLIST, and SPIRIT GUIDE. \nFurther off, at the boardroom table, four DODDERING OLD CORPORATE FARTS on the brink of death look on with glazed expressions. \nRICK (through a clenched smile) So, what kind of crap do you scumbags want me to peddle? \nHERTZ Everything. Everything except shoes, of course. Hah hah... \nHe laughs pathetically. Rick doesn't respond. Hertz nods to a nearby EXECUTIVE who hands him some BEEF STICKS. \nHERTZ Meaty Twig Beef Sticks. \nRick takes them and holds them up to the camera. Smiles. Flash. \nHERTZ Helmet Head hair spray. \nHe takes the hair spray and holds it up. Smile. Flash. \nThe assistant carefully hands Hertz a pulsating metal container with lots of warnings and danger symbols on it. Hertz gives it to Rick. \nHERTZ Noxon 24 biogenetic neuro- fertilizer. \nRick holds it up, then pushes it away in disgust. \nRICK Fertilizer? Ricky Coogan does not do ads for hi-tech cow shit. I'm a star, got it, Hertz? (to his aide) Rico, give these misguided clowns Tony Danza's phone number, and let's get the hell out of here. \nHe gives the finger to the EES photographer, who obligingly takes a picture. Hertz waves at him to get lost, and calls after Rick who's headed to the door with his entourage. \nHERTZ Rick. Wait! Only you can stand up to the radicals trying to keep Noxon from the struggling farmers whose very future depends on it. \nRICK (HESITATES) Noxon? Wasn't that just banned? \nHERTZ Only in the U.S....and Europe. \nRICK But I heard that shit's lethal. \nHertz lets out a big laugh. He shakes his head at Rick. \nHERTZ Rick, Rick, Rick... You want proof? Fine. Just take a seat. Please. \nRick nods to his entourage. They sit at the boardroom table, across from the EES execs. An easel behind Hertz shows a placard with a bar graph. Hertz whispers something to an aide, who scurries off. \nHERTZ (TO RICK) Meet the head of our South American research facility, Juan Valdez. \nThe aide ushers in a handsome LATIN AMERICAN EXECUTIVE in a natty three-piece suit and a sombrero. \nThe man mutters something weakly. Ernie puts his ear up close to hear him better. \nERNIE He says the pants don't usually come off for less than two-fifty, but since you're so cute, he'll make an exception. \nFLIP TO: \nRICK \nburied beneath rolls and rolls of bandages, making his way through the protesters on crutches. Ernie helps him along, nervously. As Rick spots Julie from behind, he hands the crutches over to Ernie. \nRICK Here. \nErnie takes the crutches. Rick waves his arms dramatically, clutches his bandaged legs, and winces in pain. \nRICK Help! Ow! Give me back my crutches! You monster! Oh, the pain! The agony! \nHe falls theatrically at Julie's feet. \nJULIE Are you okay? Let me help you! \nRICK Thanks. Don't worry about me. What's one man's pain weighed against the global injustice of corporate tyrants like EES? Go. The fight must continue. \nJulie's buying it big time. She gazes deep into Rick's eyes. \nJULIE Wow... My name's Julie. \nRICK Josh. Josh Tavner. \nErnie sticks a hand out, grinning sarcastically. \nERNIE Mother Theresa. Glad to meet you. \nJulie turns on Ernie viciously. She slaps him hard, and grabs the crutches from him. \nERNIE Ow! Hey! \nJULIE Give me those, ape. Help him up. \nRick rises to his feet \"painfully.\" \nJULIE Hey Josh, a busload of us are headed over to Maracas to protest Noxon 24 and pelt Ricky Coogan with cow shit. \nRICK Same here! You could ride with us. \nJULIE Us? You're with him? \nShe looks at Ernie, who grins stupidly. \nRICK Oh, he's okay. Have you ever heard of an idiot savant? \nJULIE Sure. \nRICK That's Ernie. Except for the savant part. \nErnie glares at Rick. Rick smiles at Julie hopefully. Julie looks at them both, and can't help smiling herself. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - DAY \nErnie drives the battered old convertible which bears the proud logo of Santa Flan Rent-a-Car. There's a Pepsi billboard in the background. Julie massages Rick in the back seat. \nRICK (faking terrible pain) Ooooh, my pelvis. \nJULIE (SYMPATHETIC) Is this better? \nERNIE'S POV IN THE REAR VIEW MIRROR \nRick moans and cracks a huge grin through his bandages. Ernie tries to get in on the conversation. \nERNIE Hey Julie. You know I'm kind of an idea man myself. Like, let's say there's a nuclear war, and the only two people left are you and the Pope... Would you pork him? \nDisgusted, Julie smacks Ernie sharply and continues massaging Rick. Scowling with jealousy, Ernie tries a new approach. \nThe car stops at the end of the long, spooky driveway, just past a sizzling electric fence. Rick, Julie, and Ernie get out and look around. It's eerily quiet. \nThere is a large dilapidated mining shed complete with rusted ducts and a tall smoke stack, a tattered carnival tent with an ornate stage flat facade, a lopsided outhouse, a creepy broken-down farm house, and in the center of it all, a giant molded carnival head with big staring eyes, which slowly rotates on a creaky base. \nErnie looks hard at the big eyes. He turns away for a second, then spins around again. The EYES are looking in a different direction. Ernie shakes his head and unwraps a chocolate bar. \nJULIE Isn't it great? It's so \"real\"... \nRICK Real stupid. (TO ERNIE) Let's go. This place is dead. \nERNIE Yeah. Where are all the weirdos? \nVOICE (O.S.) There are no weirdos here. \nStartled, they turn to see ELIJAH C. SKUGGS, a twisted, haggard old man. He takes a bite out of an ice cream cone which contains the rear half of a chipmunk with a maraschino cherry on top. Elijah has bad teeth, a bad shave, and scary eyes. We now realize the giant head is molded in his image. \nELIJAH Mutants, yes. Genetic nightmares, definitely. Children of Hell and twisted masses of living, breathing tormented flesh, certainly. But as for weirdos... not a one. Unless of course you count me! Ha ha ha! \nRICK Nah, you seem like a regular dumbshit old redneck to me. \nElijah ignores him. Julie shoots him a look and smiles at Elijah. \nJULIE I'm Julie. And you are... \nELIJAH Elijah C. Skuggs, proud proprietor of Skugg's Fabulous Freak Land and Mutant Emporium. But you knew that. After all, you've ventured miles away from civilization, hospitals, telephones, (TO RICK) police... How may I help-you? \nRICK Drop dead. \nElijah smiles, unfazed. Julie glares at Rick. She smiles apologetically at Elijah. \nJULIE We'd like to see your freak show. You see, only by appreciating the variety and innovation of nature can we come to respect the fragile complexity of our global eco- system. \nElijah nudges Ernie. \nELIJAH And you come to me looking for weirdos? \nErnie shrugs. He goes to take a bite out of his chocolate bar and finds only the empty wrapper left in his hand. \nERNIE Hey! What the-- \nHe looks behind him, and there--about ten feet away--is... \nA HULKING BALD MAN \nwarts all over, squatting on the ground and chewing happily. This is TOAD. \nJulie and Rick turn and see him. \nJULIE (REPULSED) Eeuuuwww... (composes herself and WAVES) Ahem. Hello. \nToad doesn't respond to her waves. \nELIJAH Mr. Toad is my... assistant. As for the show, I'm afraid the next parade of deformity isn't until tomorrow night... \nRick and Ernie pretend to be disappointed. They turn to leave. Julie's sincerely upset. \nJULIE Oh, just our luck... \nElijah grabs Rick's shoulder and turns him around. \nELIJAH However! I do have a private exhibit in my shed you might enjoy. I don't usually share it with the general public... \nRICK We're deeply honored. But no thanks. \nERNIE Yeah. We really must be-- \nHe raises his cigarette to his lips, but it's gone! He turns to see Toad, ten feet behind him, puffing away happily. Hmmm. Elijah is already leading Julie towards the shed. \nJULIE The sideshow tradition has been misrepresented by the media. You don't traffic in human misery. You show society the part of itself it doesn't want to look at. \nELIJAH Yes... Yesm I see... \nHe looks over to Rick and Ernie with a grin that says \"Where'd you find this nutty chick?\" \nELIJAH Let 'er rip, Toad! \nToad yanks a pull-start cord and the machine rumbles to life. Elijah pulls the Tasty Freekz lever and fills a small dish with phosphorescent ointment. Toad cuts open their clothes, exposing their sides, and pushes them close together. \nERNIE Wait a second. You're really gonna smear that stuff on us and mutate our body parts!? \nELIJAH Correct. \nERNIE Well... then could you give me a really big rodney? \nELIJAH I'm a mad scientist pal, not a miracle worker. \nElijah smears the ointment on their exposed sides. Their skin begins to bubble and undulate. \nJULIE/ERNIE Oh God!... No!... Holy shit! (ETC) \nA grapefruit-sized lump pops up on Ernie's side, then another on Julie's side, and then the lumps do a little synchronized dance together. Suddenly Ernie's flesh balloons out and melds into Julie's side. The mass of connected skin continues to bubble and mutate. Odd shapes press up under THE SKIN: \nFour humans faces that quickly become Mount Rushmore... \nThe Pepsi logo--\"Pepsi: The Choice of a New Generation\"... Julie and Ernie merge into one amorphous flesh blob which then takes the form of... \nDemon versions of GUMBY and his magic horse POKEY. Gumby's got his back to camera. He's grabbing his crotch and flipping everyone off. \nELIJAH Gumby! Put that thing away! \nGumby and Pokey mutate back into a blob and then into... \nJULIE/ERNIE \njoined side to side, their two heads on a single body which is split down the middle--half Julie, half Ernie. Elijah wheels a large mirror in front of them. \nELIJAH Feast your eyes! \nJULIE NOOOOO! \nERNIE Well, at least I'll never have to go far for a piece of tail. \nJULIE Pig! \nShe SMACKS him. \nERNIE Ouch! I was just trying to keep things light. Oh God! Why me!? \nHe starts blubbering uncontrollably. Toad drags them towards the door. \nJULIE Mother always said there'd be days like this. And I thought she was nuts! \nThey exit. Elijah turns to Rick. \nELIJAH (gestures to Julie/Ernie) A mere party trick. But you, you're gonna be special. \nElijah steps over to the computer console and starts punching keys. \nRICK (GETS TOUGH) Let me go, Skuggs, or else! (MORE) \nI got some RICK(cont'd) friends that'll come down here and mess you up bad, homey! (Elijah chuckles. Rick tries a different APPROACH) I got some other friends who can score you box seats at the Superbowl, no problem. (ANOTHER FAILURE) YOU EVER HAD YOUR BALLS CUT OFF, YOU FUCKIN' APE?! (switches gears again) You ever had a hot fudge bath with Morgana? [foreign take: Madonna] \nELIJAH (LOOKS UP--INTERESTED) You know her? \nRick nods hopefully. Elijah considers it for a moment, then frowns. \nELIJAH Ah, screw it. I'd never get anywhere with her. TOAD! FIRE UP THAT INFERNAL YOGURT MACHINE! \nToad starts the machine. Elijah pulls the lever and dispenses a bowl full of glowing ointment. He carries it towards Rick, leering maniacally. \nELIJAH For years I've strived to create the ultimate monster. The first of a whole new generation of superfreaks! Now I've finally got you, the perfect subject--a real asshole! HA-HA- (he pauses and looks closer at Rick) Wait a minute. Aren't you the guy from \"Hey Dude Three-The Beguiling?\" \nRICK Yeah, that's me! \nELIJAH You were great in that picture! Oh well, I guess for the next one they'll have to get Christian Slater! HA-HA-HA! \nElijah squishes the ointment into Rick's horrified face. \nBOB VILA walks up next to Elijah. \nBOB You know you could expose those rustic beams and put in a skylight over one weekend, Elijah. \nELIJAH Give it a rest, Bob! \nHe pushes Bob away into the freak house, gives Rick a goodbye wink and walks out the door. \nEXT. OUTHOUSE \nElijah pauses and looks at the tiny outhouse. \nELIJAH One of these days I gotta put a shitter in there. \nBob Vila steps out of nowhere again, holding a Time-Life book. \nBOB No problem. It's all here in my Beds and Bathrooms book, Elijah. And you pay nothing for thirt-- \nBONK! Elijah knocks him out cold with a ball-peen hammer from his tool belt. \nINT. FREAK HOUSE \nIt takes a few moments for Rick's eyes to adjust to the dim light. There's nobody in sight. The walls are lined with dark cubicles, stacked atop each other with walkways like prison cells. Rick staggers to his feet, and makes his way forward. \nRICK Ernie? Julie? \nERNIE Over here, Coog. \nJULIE Are you alright? \nRick sees the vague outline of JulieErnie a few yards away. \nRICK I know that voice. That's the voice that said, (MIMICS) \"Cool, a freak show. Let's check it out!\" \nJULIE What!? Oh sure, blame the woman. Typical. \nRICK (MIMICS) \"It's so real.\" Is this real enough for you? I'm friggin' Quasimodo! \nERNIE Chill out, Coog. You're talking to the original tag team of ugly pukes. Step into the light. \nRICK Okay, here I come. \nRick steps forward into a pool of light. Julie and Ernie are caught by surprise. Julie struggles to keep her composure. Ernie's repulsed. \nERNIE ULP! \nErnie turns away and pukes on the floor. Julie soldiers on. \nJULIE Oh geez... It's not so (GULP) revolting. After all, physical beauty is just a socially-enforced myth that we, uh, oh shit... ULPI \nJulie turns away and pukes on the floor. \nRICK (OFFENDED) Yeah, well, you're no Mona Lisas yourself. You're lucky I've got a strong stomach! \nVOICE (O.C.) And you're lucky I don't BITE you! Heh heh heh heh ... \nRick wheels around to see JUAN THE DOG BOY, snickering behind him. Juan is a hairy young Mexican with a snout, dog ears, and canine teeth--Scrappy Doo with an attitude. \nRick assumes a threatening pose. \nRICK Get away from me you, you... \nJUAN Freak? Ha ha hahahaha! (he stares hard at Rick) I am Juan the Dog Boy, leader of the freaks. \nJULIE (walks up to them) Kind of the \"top dog.\" \nJuan scratches himself behind the ear with his hind leg. \nJUAN Welcome to Hell, Rick. Shake? \nHe extends a hand to Rick. Rick doesn't take it. He hears a slight RUSTLING noise from the direction of the cubicles, and turns to look around the apparently empty Freak House. \nRICK No thanks. I don't plan on staying long. How many of you are there in here anyway? \nERNIE Call me old-fashioned, but I'll go with Paul Lynde. \nJULIE Don't be an idiot. \nThey argue back and forth, hitting and poking each other 3 Stooges style. Juan turns to Rick. \nJUAN You see, Rick? Just because we're freaks doesn't mean we can't have some fun, huh? \nRick is overwhelmed by it all. He backs away. \nRICK Get away from me. Get away! I'm not like you. You hear me? I'm Ricky Coogan! I AM NOT A FREAK! \nThe Freaks laugh in Rick's face. He storms off. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nANOTHER AREA OF THE FREAK HOUSE--A LITTLE LATER \nRick sits in a corner, pondering his fate. Oddly, there's a shiny new Pepsi machine in this dingy corner of the Freak House. JulieErnie approach him. \nERNIE Okay Coog, so I get twenty four hour access to T `n' A, and you look like a plate of rancid giblets. We're still pals, right? \nRick shoots him a look. \nJULIE All the freaks have gone through this anguish, Rick. At first, I was blinded by my anger. I admit it. I wanted to break your neck for getting me into this. But I got over it. Juan taught me to channel my anger for the common good. \nRICK It was your fault, anyway. You wanted to see the freak show. \nJULIE (FURIOUS) I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SHUT UP! \nShe tries to wring his neck. Ernie helps. Rick glares at Ernie. \nRICK Ernie! \nERNIE Oh... Sorry, Coog. For a second there, I was a total man-hater. Weird. \nJulie regains her cool. She takes out a pamphlet, scribbles something on it, and hands it to Rick. \nJULIE Here. Take it. \nRick examines the cover. He reads it aloud. \nRICK \"So You're a Hideous Mutant Freak-- Now What?\" \nThere's an \"8\" scribbled on the pamphlet. \nJULIE we're in cubicle eight. Maybe later you'll be ready to talk. \nRICK Forget it. Not me. I'm not like those other god-forsaken animals. \nHe throws the-pamphlet to the ground, just as the Worm, Bearded Lady, and Sockhead approach. They sit down in a circle around him. The Worm looks down at the pamphlet and puffs thoughtfully on his pipe. \nWORM You're mistaken, Rick. You are exactly like us. We were all normal healthy folk before we made the fateful mistake of visiting this hell hole at an off hour. Why, when I first came here... \nWAVY FLASHBACK DISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FREAK COMPOUND - THE PAST \nThe Worm, as an OXFORD PROFESSOR, is wandering around the grounds, taking notes and puffing on his pipe. \nWORM (V.O.) I was a professor of lacrophylogy-- er, the study of worms, of course. I came in search of the Epsosophecci dilepsidae--in layman terms, the fat pudgy worm. Mr. Skuggs said he had just such a worm in his shed. How could I have surmised that the specimen and I would ultimately prove to be one and the same? \nWe see professor Worm meet Elijah, and follow him into the lab. The smoke stack belches a plume of flames as we hear his off-camera screams. DISSOLVE back to.. \nTHE FREAK HOUSE--NOW \nThe Worm finishes his tale. \nWORM At first, the transformation was fabulous. I truly understood the worm's ethos like never before. But those early days of fascination are over. Now, in retrospect, I think the whole thing is a fucking headache. I'd sell my soul just to be able to wipe my own ass... \nHe sniffles a little, but manages to hold back the tears. We pan to Sockhead. \nSOCKHEAD I first came here as a tourist, looking for some fun... \nRick peeks around and sees Julie scratching Juan's belly. He licks her face happily, and she giggles with delight. Ernie is reading \"The Woman's Room,\" trying not to notice all of this. \nRick watches, disgusted. He tears up the pamphlet, throws it to the ground, and storms off to find his own cubicle. \nErnie peeks at Julie and Juan continuing their foreplay. Juan stops abruptly. \nJUAN Hey. Mind your business. \nERNIE Sorry. \nErnie returns to his book. The camera PANS up to Rick's cubicle. He's sitting on his cot, distractedly whittling a log with his knife-like talon. He talks to himself, making sure to be loud enough for JulieErnie and Juan to hear. \nRICK Well that EES guy should rescue me any minute. Then it's straight to the plastic surgeon and back to sunny old L.A. I wonder how many of my beautiful, anatomically correct girlfriends will be waiting for me. \nSTUEY GLUCK (V.O.) I'll be waiting for you, Rick! \nRICK Thanks, Stuey. \nRick looks up and sees a holographic image of Stuey Gluck floating in the air above him. \nRICK AHH! A phantom troll! \nHe swings the log wildly at the hologram, but it keeps darting around, dodging the blows. Cowboy leans around the cubicle wall. He talks a lot like Gomer Pyle. \nCOWBOY (NEIGHBORLY) Seeing phantom trolls, Rick? \nRICK (INNOCENTLY) No. \nRick stops swinging, lamely pretends he was stretching, and ignores Stuey, who hovers around him. \nCOWBOY Sounds to me like you've developed a telepathic bond. Don't mean yer nuts or nuthin'. Heck, old Nosey, why he can smell the future. Lots of us freaks got E.S.P. And Sockhead, he's got E.S.P.N. \nHe points at Sockhead, who's watching pro wrestling on a portable TV. \nSOCKHEAD Watch out, Hulk! He's gonna try the skull cracker! \nCOWBOY Shucks, Rick, you're lucky. Telepathy like yours only occurs between real soulmates. A bond like that should be cherished. \nCowboy smiles and ducks back into his own cubicle. \nSTUEY Wow! I'm Ricky Coogan's soulmate! \nRICK In your dreams! Now get lost, troll! \nHe swings wildly at the hologram, which starts to break up and fade away. \nSTUEY (FADING AWAY) Wait'll I tell the kids at school! \nStuey disappears. Cowboy leans into Rick's cubicle again. \nCOWBOY Shucksm Rick, it don't make sense to spurn your soulmate. I reckon that troll could help you if you just let him into your heart. \nRick scoffs at him and starts whittling again. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STUEY'S ROOM - DAY \nIt's a cramped room filled with Ricky Coogan memorabilia. Stuey is drawing a crude sketch of Rick on a pad. This sequence is set to brassy \"man on a mission\" music. \nSTUEY Once America sees what happened to Ricky, they'll probably send the whole FBI down to save him! \nCUT TO: \nINT. L.A. TIMES HALLWAY \nStuey marches towards a frosted glass door that reads \"THE LOS ANGELES TIMES\". \nSTUEY I'll probably win a Pulitzer prize for this scoop. And I'll dedicate it to Rick! \nHe walks through the door. Beat. SMASH! He comes flying out through the glass and lands on his butt. \nTHE \"TIME MAGAZINE\" DOOR--SMASH! Stuey flies out through it. \nElijah walks out on stage and looks at the rowdy audience. It's total mayhem. \nELIJAH (CALMLY) Quiet, please. \nEveryone instantly sits down, shuts up, and looks up obediently at Elijah. \nELIJAH Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, you are about to witness a cavalcade of atrocities so horrific, I advise the more sensitive members of our audience to leave the premises. \nTwo SENSITIVE LOOKING MEN wearing sweaters draped over their shoulders politely get up and leave. \nELIJAH Tonight I'm proud to announce the addition of several new monstrosities to the show, including our star attraction, the Beast Boy--an untamed and highly dangerous ghoul who's liable to go nuts and kill us all at the drop of a hat. (impressed \"oohs\", \"ahhs\", and \"cools\" from the AUDIENCE) But first up, prepare to behold an unspeakably repulsive yet heartwarming atrocity, Three Men and a Baby! \nTHREE MEN AND A BABY, all fused into a single multi-limbed freak, walks out onstage. One of its arms holds up a dirty diaper, and all the three men hold their noses and grimace. The audience breaks into warm-hearted laughter and applause. \nBACKSTAGE \nThe freaks mill around in the caged-in green room, guarded by Toad. Frogman, dressed in a magician's outfit over his wetsuit, holds an empty dove cage and searches the room, whistling for his missing dove. Nosey sneezes up a cloud of feathers. JulieErnie walk determinedly towards the adjacent Men's and Women's restrooms... BONK! They hit the wall between the two doors. \nRick is reading his \"script\", rehearsing his lines. He's wearing a cheesy \"jungle\" costume. \nRICK Arrrggg. I am Beast Boy. I will eat you. Arrrghh. (he throws down the SCRIPT) I can't do this shit! \nHe peers through the bars, scanning the audience for signs.of a rescue party. \nRICK Damn it! What's keeping those guys? \nThe Worm creeps up behind Rick. \nWORM Something's troubling you, my boy. what is it? \nRICK Well, let's see. I've been kidnapped, hideously disfigured, imprisoned with a bunch of mutant freaks, my rescue party is M.I.A., and this dialogue makes \"Hey Dude Three\" read like \"Dr. Zhivago.\" \nWORM I think I know what you're going through. I too had an eating disorder. You see, I've always had a feverish obsession with pudding. And when I was a young lad... \nRick groans and looks out at the audience. \nELIJAH \nonstage. \nELIJAH And now a perennial favorite here at Freakland, ladies and gentlemen. I know you'll all enjoy the musical stylings of Rosie the Pinhead. \nRosie the Pinhead struts out wearing a sexy dress and holding a microphone. After the applause dies down, she whips off her sunglasses with a flourish, revealing her extremely goofy- looking crossed eyes. She wails incomprehensibly and bonks her head with the mic. \nROSIE (DROOLING) EEEEOOOOOOOOOOOOOIIIIIEEEEEE... \nA series of WIPES show bits of various acts as the evening WEARS ON: \nERNIE/JULIE \nare doing a Vaudeville style stand-up routine while tap dancing. \nERNIE Hey Julie, how many feminists does it take to screw in a light bulb? \nJULIE How many? \nERNIE Two. One to screw it in and one to ride my Rodney! Ha-ha-ha! \nJULIE Oaf! \nShe bonks him with their cane. He bonks her back. She knocks him cold. They both fall down. \nTHE BEARDED LADY \nis doing a make-over demonstration. He's got a local GIRL from the audience sitting at a makeup table onstage. \nBEARDED LADY If your coloring is in the autumn range, like Maria's, try an earth tone eye makeup. Now I've done a lovely French braid on Maria, but I encourage everyone to experiment and use your imagination. The main thing is to just have fun with it. \nThe audience is engrossed. Some take notes. \nSOCKHEAD \nis ringing those \"tuned bells\" and singing along. \nKEVIN (CHUCKLES SNIDELY) I'm saying you're ugly enough to burn the nosehairs off a dead nun. \nThe crowd bursts into cruel hysterics, pointing mockingly at Rick. Even Alistair Cooke is practically choking with laughter. \nALISTAIR COOKE AH-HA-HA-HA! WHAT A PUTZ! \nRick looks around, horrified at the sea of evil, jeering faces. He begins to tremble. Then... \nRICK'S MONSTER EYE \nsprings to life for the first time and glows red with rage. His whole monster side awakens and takes charge of his body with violent intensity. He grabs Kevin's head and screams in a new, monstrous voice. \nRICK EAT SHIT! \nPOP! He plucks Kevin's head off his neck and holds it aloft. The head stares down at Rick in disbelief. \nKEVIN'S HEAD Now you're just being childish. \nRick serves the head like a volleyball, smashing it to bits. The crowd panics and charges for the exits. \nCROWD AHHHHHH! HELP! LET US OUT OF HERE! \nPeople are trampling over each other in the mayhem. Alistair Cooke is crushed under the stampede. \nThe freaks are horrified. Monster Rick growls triumphantly. Elijah looks on, intrigued. \nELIJAH Now that's entertainment. \nINT. FREAK HOUSE - MORNING \nRick awakens with a start and gets up. He approaches JulieErnie, The Bearded Lady, Nosey and Dog Boy, who are idly playing a game of \"Wheel of Fortune.\" The cubicles contain large blank blocks, like the \"letters\" on the game show. So far, there's a \"D\", two \"S\"s, and a \"K\" revealed. Rosie the Pinhead plays Vanna White's role. \nNOSEY I'd like to buy a vowel. \nThe Bearded lady yawns. Rick edges towards them. \nRICK Hey. The Wheel. Mind if I sit in? \nJuan advances towards Rick, sneering. \nJUAN So. Now you don't mind mixing with us--how did you say it--sorry mutants? \nRICK Look! I'm sorry for what happened at the show. Can't you just forget it? \nHe shakes his finger at Juan, and notices there's still a human nose stuck on his monster claw. He wipes it off, embarrassed. There's an awkward pause. Ernie breaks the silence. \nERNIE Hey, shouldn't you tell Rick about your big escape plan? \nJuan gives Ernie a nasty \"shut up\" look. He growls at him. \nERNIE Well, excuse me for living. \nRICK You have an escape plan? \nJUAN Listen, Beast Boy, the games are a simple diversion. (MORE) JUAN(CONT'D) Beneath our twisted flesh we freaks cry out for freedom! Aooooooorrraaaagh! \nJuan howls lustily. He looks to rest of the freaks. They're a pathetic lot, and their half-hearted howl proves it. \nFREAKS Aoo... \nBeat. \nJULIE Juan's plan is really ingenious Rick. See, he figured out that-- \nJUAN I figured out that our escape does not include the Beast Boy. No one may discuss the plan with him, understand? \nJuan gives the others a threatening look. They mumble agreement. \nRICK What's the matter with all of you? You trust your lives to a guy just 'cause he can lick his own privates? \nThe freaks ponder this a second, then nod \"yes\". \nERNIE You gotta admit, Coog, it's a helluva trick. \nHe looks at the giant head- the eyes are gone, leaving only empty eyesockets! Rick hears A BURST OF MACHINEGUN FIRE behind him, spins around and faces ... \nTWO THREE FOOT HIGH EYEBALLS \nwith little arms and legs, wearing Jamaican Rasta hats and aiming smoking Uzi 9mms in the air. They aim their Uzis at Rick. One holds a walkie-talkie, the other holds a big spliff. \nRICK AHHHH! \nA T.V. MONITOR in Elijah's hands, shows Rick staring at us, the Eye's POV. \nELIJAH \nseen in extreme close-up, watches the surveillance monitor. He speaks into a microphone. We don't see what the room looks like. \nELIJAH Good work, Eye and Eye. \nTHE EYES \nbob in response to Elijah. They have no mouths, but their pupils open and close when they speak. \nEYE AND EYE (JAMAICAN ACCENTS) Rastafari. \nELIJAH (V.0.) (over the walkie-talkie) Now bring the Beast Boy to my, uh, den. Ha-ha-ha-ha! \nRick looks worried as they lead him towards the scary looking house. \nINT. ELIJAH'S DEN \nIt's a lovely, suburban den with a coffee table full of magazines like \"Better Homes and Gardens,\" \"National Review\" and \"Freaks Illustrated\". Elijah sits in a big Barcalounger, smoking a pipe. Rick sits on the sofa. Toad walks up with a tray of soft drinks. \nELIJAH (TO RICK) Diet soda? \nRICK No thanks. \nElijah points to a bowl of Fiddle Faddle. Toad sits beside Rick. \nELIJAH Fiddle Faddle? (Rick shakes his head) You sure? \nRICK Well, okay. (he scoops some into his MOUTH) Well, are you gonna torture me or kill me or something? \nELIJAH Torture my greatest creation ever!? Kill the final piece of the puzzle that I've been putting together for years!? Sure, it'd be fun, but I've got a bigger plan, my boy. (MORE) ELIJAH(CONT'D) And when you ripped off that guy's head, I knew it was working like gangbusters! \nRICK But I thought I scared everyone away. \nELIJAH Uh-huh. And then they told two friends, and they told two friends, and so on, and so on. Look at this. \nElijah grabs a big mail bag and spills some letters out on the table. Elijah opens one and reads it. \nELIJAH (READING) Dear Mister Skuggs, I was shocked and disgusted when my grandson told me about the head-popping beast at your show. Please send me six tickets. (he reads another) Dear Beast Boy, I used to like New Kids on The Block, but you're way cuter. My favorite ice cream is chocolate. Is it fun ripping people's heads off? I love you. (ANOTHER LETTER) The Beast Boy is on a blood-letting spree, and Oscar is along for the ride! (he looks up at Rick) That one's from Pat Collins! \nRICK Yeah, but she loves everything. \nRick reaches for the Fiddle Faddle but the bowl is empty. Toad BURPS. \nELIJAH Toad! That Fiddle Faddle is for guests only! You've had enough! \nToad is blankfaced. Elijah walks over and refills the bowl. Rick scoops some into his mouth. Elijah walks to the fireplace and pushes the embers around with a poker. \nRICK Look Skuggs--Elijah--I've been in show business all my life. The public does not want to see disgusting, depraved violent filth. \nELIJAH Oh, and I suppose Jake and the Fatman is just a fluke? \nThe phone rings. Elijah looks at it, and back to Rick. \nELIJAH (CONT'D) I'll get it. \nHe goes over to the phone and lifts the receiver. \nELIJAH `Yello? \nOn the other end of the line, we hear LAUGHING MAN's insane chuckle. Elijah's smooth smile fades. He turns his back to- Rick, who strains to identify the familiar laughing voice. Elijah scribbles notes on a pad by the phone. \nELIJAH Yes... Right... Tomorrow... Mmhmm... Mnunhmm... Wow. Okay. You got it... Hasta la vista to you too. Hahaahahaahaha-- \nERNIE (TO JULIE) God, I can't believe he left you for a squirrel. What a dick. \nJulie's hurt. She doesn't even smack Ernie. \nRICK You know how men are. Besides, it was a pretty good looking squirrel. \nJulie looks at Rick. She sees he's trying to be helpful, not sarcastic. \nJULIE (to the others) Come on. You heard the Beast Boy. Back to the Freak House, now. \nHer eyes meet Rick's. She manages a smile, and Rick smiles back. Ernie sizes up the situation and groans as they all head back to the Freak House. \nERNIE Not again. (TO RICK) Oh well, at least we'll get to try a new position. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STARK INTERROGATION ROOM \nWe're moving in towards a door in this desolate, vaguely corporate looking hallway. \nINSIDE THE ROOM \nWe're looking at the back of Laughing Man's leather chair. We hear his CACKLE, as well as STUEY GLUCK'S TORTURED SCREAMS and a horrible POWER TOOL NOISE. We can see the usual bright interrogation spotlight, and a couple of extra GOONS watching the goings on, but Stuey and his actual torturer are hidden by Laughing Man's chair. \nSTUEY (O.S.) AHHHHH! STOP IT! OOOWWWWW! \nWe move past Mr. Big's chair to reveal Stuey lying face down on a table, while Bob Vila is using a power sander on his butt. Bob is happily giving pointers to the two goons. \nBOB Notice the way I use an elliptical motion to chafe Stuey's buttocks. (the Goons nod ATTENTIVELY) It's all here in my new book: Pipes, Fixtures, and Torturing TROLLS-- \nLAUGHING MAN(O.S.) (Loud, sharp laugh) A-HA-HA-HAHA-HA-HA-HA! \nBob obediently shuts up. Laughing Man directs a sinister low chuckle to Stuey. \nSTUEY No way. I'll never talk! I'm made of stone! \nBob considers this a second, then starts up a jackhammer. \nSTUEY HELP! RICK! RIIIIIIIIIICCKKK! \nCUT TO: \nINT. FREAK HOUSE - DAY \nWe hear LONESOME HARMONICA MUSIC as we pan past the cubicles. \nCowboy is playing the harmonica... The Bearded Lady unties the pretty pink ribbon in his hair and sets it aside... \nSuddenly, we switch to HORRIFIC PSYCHO STINGS as the camera picks up PAUL LYNDE'S CORPSE with flashing red lights. His eyeball drips out of the socket again... \nThen it's back to the SAD HARMONICA MUSIC. In the next cubicle, Ernie is sleeping, Julie is awake, dreamily fondling a large eclair. She looks longingly up towards Rick's cubicle as we... \nDREAM DISSOLVE TO: \nDREAMLAND \nRick (his face is normal) and Julie kiss passionately in a billowy white bed amidst puffy clouds. \nRICK (SINCERE) Julie, compared to this, sex with Julia Roberts was a thankless chore. \nQUICK DISSOLVE BACK TO: \nJULIE' \nWe follow her gaze, panning up to Rick. He's lying on his bed, dreamily fondling a donut. He looks down towards Julie's cabin... \nDREAM DISSOLVE TO: \nDREAMLAND \nRick and Julie kiss passionately. We're tight on them. \nJULIE Oh Rick, you've touched a place in me no one has ever touched before. \nHe takes his seat again. \nRICK (TO EVERYONE) Tomorrow night, at the show, I'll be turned into a homicidal monster and forced to kill you all. But we might have a chance if we act fast. And I'm prepared to be your new leader. \nA THRILLING CHORD. \nNOSEY (TO SOCKHEAD) I say we kill him. \nSockhead nods. \nRICK And I've got a plan. \nANOTHER THRILLING CHORD. \nNOSEY I still say we kill him. \nSockhead nods again. \nRICK If we can get into Elijah's lab, maybe we can-- \nWORM Of course! Design a super freak of our own and manipulate the genetic code to make him destroy Elijah instead of us! Brilliant! \nRICK Oh. Well-- \nBEARDED LADY But how do we get to the lab? \nRICK Um, maybe-- \nCOWBOY Right! The worm could dig a tunnel! \nWORM By God, it's so crazy it might just work! \nERNIE But you need Noxon 24 to make the freaking sludge, and Elijah told us himself he's run out of it. \nRICK Oh. Oh yeah. Well, see, what I was going to say was-- \nJULIE Yes! Exactly! If they've been using Noxon 24 as a fertilizer here, the entire ecosystem must be soaked with it! All we need is a way to extract it from the vegetation, ideally into a liquid form. \nRICK Right. Well, what about-- \nCOWBOY Golly! So that's why my milk comes out that funny green color! I thought the grass tasted funny! Wow, Rick, you're a genius! \nJULIE (SMILES WARMLY) Good thinking, Rick. \nThe freaks all nod in agreement. \nNOSEY Way to go, Rick! How did you ever think of such a plan? \nRick pulls out an old comic book and points to an ad for Sea Monkeys. \nRICK Well, actually, I was going to suggest we send away for sea monkeys, train them to fire guns, and make a break for it. But if you want to go with this other thing, I guess that's okay. \nThe freaks stare at him, not sure if he's kidding or not. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FREAK HOUSE - NIGHT \nFREAKS ON A MISSION MONTAGE, SET TO A POUNDING \"EYE OF THE TIGER\"-TYPE SONG \n-Nosey milks Cowboy, squirting the glowing milk into a funnel which feeds into a crude still. The Torch heats the boiler. \n-The Worm digs the tunnel. JulieErnie hand Rick pieces of wood which he puts into place as tunnel supports. They hand him Paul Lynde's corpse and he wedges it in as well. \n-Everyone's getting into it and working up a sweat. Nosey wipes his brow, opens a bottle of Pepsi and chugs it down in a beautifully lit slo-mo product shot... The other freaks follow suit, including the Worm, down in the tunnel, who struggles to hold the bottle in his tiny feeler. \nEverything's going great and the song is really pumping when... \nELIJAH \nruns out on his front porch in his nightclothes and screams down at the outhouse. \nELIJAH WOULD YOU TURN DOWN THAT GODDAMN RACKET!? \nThe Worm breaks through into a small cavern with several exposed sewer pipes. A lovable mutt leaps out of a pipe and drops an old tennis ball in front of Rick. He starts licking Rick's face. \nRICK Scrappy! \nSAPPY MUSIC wells up. \nRICK It's been ten years since you chased this ball into the sewer! I thought you were gone for good! \nSCRAPPY Yap! \nRICK Listen Scrap. Go home. Get help. Understand? \nSCRAPPY Yap! \nRICK Good boy! Now go! \nScrappy runs away into the sewer pipe. Rick shrugs. \nRICK You never know. \nJulie taps on some exposed wood on the cavern ceiling. \nJULIE Look, a wood floor. \nWORM It must be the lab! we've done it! \nThey all look at each other excitedly. Suddenly Elijah's voice rings out behind them. \nELIJAH'S VOICE Not so fast, you scabrous freaks! \nThey spin around and see Nosey holding the bottle of Noxon 24. He grins. \nNOSEY Didn't know I did impressions, did ya? \nINT. FREAK HOUSE \nThe freaks are waiting around the hole. Nosey pops out. \nNOSEY Mission accomplished. They've got the Noxon, and they'll be in the lab within minutes. \nFROGMAN Boy, this is going like clockwork! \nEveryone smiles, pats each other on the back, etc. Except Sockhead, who finally snaps. \nSOCKHEAD No! Can't you see we're digging our own graves!? (MORE) \nIt's nuts, SOCKHEAD(cont'd) that's what it is! Nuts! Well, maybe you've all got a deathwish, but you can count me out! I'M GETTING THE HELL OUT OF HERE! \nHe runs amok, pushes various freaks to the ground, and runs around screaming. The freak house door opens--Eye and Eye step in to check out the noise. One of them has a spliff sticking out of its pupil. Sockhead charges at them like a mad dog. They aim their Uzis. \nSOCKHEAD (at the Eyes) OUT OF MY WAY! \nRATTA-RATTA-RATTA! They spray an ungodly amount of bullets into Sockhead. He falls to the ground. The Eyes leave. \nThe freaks gather around Sockhead. Nosey pulls the sock off his hand head, which is making a little \"Senor Pepe\" face with its fist. It spits up a trickle of blood and tries to speak. \nSOCKHEAD (WEAK) I... I... just... wanna...say... \nNOSEY What is it, kid? \nSOCKHEAD Ah, forget it. I'm not much for dying. \nHe goes limp. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELIJAH'S LAB \nJulieErnie, the Worm, and Rick are just emerging from the hole. It's really dark in the lab. \nERNIE Shit. I can't see a damn thing. \nRICK Keep your voice down, Ernie. \nRick slams his hand down for emphasis and impales it on one of those desktop paper pins. He SCREAMS in agony. \nINT. ELIJAH'S DEN \nElijah's watching an old war movie--a soldier is running across a battlefield with a bayonet, SCREAMING. He doesn't hear Rick. \nINT. LAB \nJulie has her hand over Rick's mouth, silencing his scream. He calms down. He gingerly slides the pin out of his hand, grimacing but not making a sound. He sighs with relief. The coast seems clear. Then, in SLOW MOTION, his hand knocks a styrofoam cup off the desk and onto the ground. \nINT. ELIJAH'S DEN \nThe war movie has erupted into a massive battle--machine guns blaring, grenade launchers and bazookas booming, the works. Suddenly, his ears perk up, and his head swivels around towards the window. \nELIJAH Styrofoam cup? \nHe puts on his \"smiley face\" robe and bunny slippers and heads out the door. \nINT. LAB \nJulie is pouring the distilled Noxon into the top of the Tasty Freekz machine. \nWORM Don't you think we should make some more pudding first, as a test? \nRICK No. Here goes. \nHe presses some buttons on the computer, and the Tasty Freekz machine starts humming. Ernie is looking out the window. \nERNIE Somebody's comin'! Hurry. \nRICK We have to wait. There's no way to speed up the machine. \nEXT. ELIJAH'S HOUSE \nElijah comes out of the house and walks towards the lab. \nINT. LAB \nRick's starting to sweat. He looks over at Julie, who holds an empty Pepsi cup under the Tasty Freekz spigot. A drop of ointment drips out and into the container. \nJULIE Here it comes. \nTHE LAB DOORKNOB \nbegins to turn slowly. \nEverybody freezes. The flow of ooze slows to a stop. \nRICK It's plugged up! \nThey look over at the doorknob--it's still turning. \nERNIE (TO WORM) If it's your damn pudding, I'll ring your wormy neck. \nWORM (under his breath) Preposterous... I have no neck. I'm a worm, imbecile. \nTHE DOOR KNOB \nis still turning, agonizingly slowly... \nOUTSIDE THE LAB \nElijah is trying to turn the knob,, His grip keeps slipping because of the butter on his fingers. \nELIJAH Aaargh! Damn buttered popcorn! \nIN THE LAB \nThe spigot has started to discharge more,reliably. The Pepsi cup is filling up now. \nOUTSIDE \nElijah is wiping his hands off on his shirt tails. He tries the door knob again. \nRICK But we left it in the lab. \nThe freaks jeer and pelt Rick with rotten vegetables. He desperately pulls a bag of cookies out of his pocket. \nRICK But wait! I found some macaroons! And there's plenty for all of us! \nThe freaks burst into applause again. \nFREAKS Yaayyy! \nTIME DISSOLVE TO: \nINT. FREAK HOUSE - DAY \nThe Freaks are all sleeping, macaroon crumbs still left on their faces. There's a lot of snoring. Rick awakens with a start. He hears something in the distance. Something like a helicopter... He gets up and peeks out a crack in the wall. \nRICK'S POV. EXT. FREAKLAND - DAY \nAn EES corporate helicopter touches down. A few gun-toting SECURITY GUYS in dark suits and dark glasses get out. They check that the coast is clear, then give the signal. Out steps Richard Hertz. He mutters something to one of the security guys, and walks towards the Freak House. \nIN THE FREAK HOUSE \nRICK (under his breath) I don't believe it. What's Hertz doin' here? \nThe door to the Freak House opens. Hertz enters, unzips his fly. Finding no toilet, he shrugs and relieves himself on the floor. Rick steps out of the shadows towards him. \nRICK So EES is in bed with Elijah C. Skuggs, eh? Figures. \nHertz is momentarily startled by Rick. He collects himself. \nHERTZ Rick! Thank God I got to you in time! \nRICK Cut the crap, Hertz. \nHertz relieves himself as he talks. \nHERTZ Ricky, you have no idea how your misfortune has touched our hearts. When you disappeared we almost gave up hope. But we'd heard reports of Skuggs's reckless abuse of Noxon, and when the story broke in the tabloids, I decided to personally come down and get to the bottom of things. \nHe zips up and heads to the door. \nRICK (SKEPTICAL) Really? \nHERTZ No. (BEAT) AHA HA HEE HEE HO HO HA HA HEE HEE HO HO HO HA HA HA HA! \nThe cackle is unmistakable--Rick's face twists in horror as he realizes... Hertz is THE LAUGHING MAN! Hertz ducks out the door. Rick looks after him, stunned. \nWe hear a nearby SNORE cut off, and the Human Torch stands up from the spot where Hertz relieved himself. He's dripping wet and no longer on fire. He sniffs his soaked, smoldering clothing. \nTORCH Peuw! Hey! Of all the... That really pisses me off! \nPOOF! He catches fire again and walks off. Rick is doing a slow burn, still looking after Hertz. He erupts and his monster eye glows briefly. He screams in anguish. \nRICK AAARRGGGGHH! \nDejected, Rick leans against the wall. JulieErnie walk up behind him. Julie puts a hand on Rick's shoulder to comfort him. As they look into each other's eyes, a loud CRASH distracts them. Rick peers through the crack. \nRICK'S POV \nA caravan of EES trucks crash through the front gate and drive up to the lab. There's a few cargo trucks and a huge NOXON-24 tanker. \nRICK Holy shit. \nA forklift drives out of the back of one of the large trucks, carrying the old corporate farts on a wooden palette. \nOne of them falls off, and a bunch of WORKMEN scramble out to prop him up and push him back into place. \nINT. LAB - DAY \nElijah switches on the lights, and turns to face his audience. Hertz is accompanied by his stone-faced security men and various executives. Workmen are busy installing the old board of directors and their arm-raising pulley system. \nELIJAH Nice to see you in the flesh, Laughing Man. \nHERTZ No need to use codenames, Elijah. We're all friends here. And just to prove it, I brought you a little present. \nELIJAH Ha-ha. Gee, I'd love to see your plans. \nHERTZ We'd love to show you. (to his assistant) Bill, if you'd be so kind. \nBILL BLAZER, a slick and dashing EES marketing executive, strides confidently up to the podium. \nStuey has to duck the fast approaching legs. Bill steps over him, not even noticing he's there. \nBill takes Elijah's \"Freak World\" graphic off an easel, and replaces it with his own. Finding no place to deposit Elijah's, he simply drops it on the floor. Elijah looks a little hurt. \nBILL What does today's businessman want? How about a receptionist with six arms, five mouths, and a knockout figure? That'd sure speed things up, wouldn't it? \nWith a big smile, Bill reveals an illustration of a multi- limb secretary (in a sexy dress) talking on three different phones, taking notes, and typing, all at once. \nStuey heads towards the Pepsi cup. He brushes against the back of Hertz's legs. Hertz looks over at Elijah beside him, who smiles politely. Hertz smiles back, invitingly. Maybe there's a few things we don't know about him. \nBILL In the factory, how 'bout a worker with twelve busy hands, no mouth to talk back, and no genitalia or digestive system to distract him from his work? (HE CHUCKLES) Sure! It's what we all dream of! \nThe EES guys all nod along. Except for the workmen, who exchange worried looks. Elijah's still not sure what to make of it all. \nMeanwhile, Stuey has the Pepsi cup of sludge in hand, and he's crawling under the table towards the door. He brushes up against the back of Elijah's legs. \nElijah looks over to Hertz, who gives him that smile again. Elijah looks away quickly, panicky. \nBILL (CONT'D) Well, with this Skuggs-based Noxon technology, it's not only possible, it's just the beginning! Of course, what happened to our expensive spokesman Ricky Coogan was an unfortunate coincidence, but profits from these new markets could total in the billions. \nAll the executives turn to Hertz. He cracks a smile. \nHERTZ Ricky who? \nThe executives laugh heartily. Stuey glances across the room to the door. He has to make a break for it, so he does. \nELIJAH Hey! Hold on! \nStuey freezes. He's right out in the open, in plain view. Still, nobody seems to see him. They're still watching- Bill's presentation. \nELIJAH Secretaries? Worker drones? Where's the fun? Where's the spark? Where's the unspeakable evil? \nBill laughs pleasantly. \nBILL Ha-ha. I was just getting to that. \nBill launches back into his speech with more intensity than even the best infomercials. Meanwhile, Stuey inches towards the door, moving as imperceptibly as possible. \nBILL We'll impact every field. COSMETICS--BREAST ENLARGEMENT creams, nosejobs in a bottle. Military--human death machines that make Schwarzenegger look like a pansy! And why stop at consumer products? Hell, we can design a whole new consumer! A few well placed drops in the water supply, and bingo! It's a new master race, and we own the copyright! An entire planet of freaks owned and operated by us! Every part of their bodies comes from an EES supplier, every thought they think is EES policy! From now on gentlemen, it's EES uber alles! EES uber alles! \nThe EES guys clap and shout approval. Elijah's impressed too. He leans over to Hertz. \nELIJAH This guy's good. \nHERTZ We lured him away from A.T.&T. \nStuey is finally out the door. Of course, now they spot him. \nSECURITY GUY Look! The troll! \nHERTZ After him! \nEXT. LAB \nStuey is outside the lab. Inexplicably, (actually it's just because he's so stupid) he's still moving inch by inch. He calls to Rick through the tape on his mouth. \nSTUEY Mmm! Mmmmm! \nINT. FREAK HOUSE \nRick sees the image of Stuey inching away from the lab. \nRICK Take the tape off your mouth, idiot! They didn't tie your hands! \nStuey realizes this is true, and pulls the tape off his mouth. \nSTUEY I got the cup, Rick! \nSTUEY (V.0.) Rick! Over here! \nStuey's waving cup is blocking the view of a big, annoyed BIKER sitting behind him. Elijah quiets the crowd and holds up a beaker of ointment. \nELIJAH With this remarkable ointment of my own design, I will now turn this half-finished ghoul into the ultimate super freak, dedicated to evil! \nElijah puts on some rubber gloves and prepares to glop Rick, who squints under the spotlight, still searching for Stuey. He calls out telepathically. \nRICK (V.0.) Stuey! Where are you?! \nStuey stands up on his seat and waves the cup, totally blocking the biker's view. He telepathically replies. \nSTUEY (V.0.) Here I am, Rick! \nBIKER (TO STUEY) Goddammit, kid! Would you sit down!? \nThe biker grabs the cup and dumps it over Stuey's head. The \"good ointment\" runs down all over Stuey's body. \nSTUEY AAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! \nAll eyes turn to Stuey, who falls down and disappears onto the floor screaming. \nRICK Oh no! \nBIKER What the hell!? \nSuddenly an EIGHT FOOT TALL MONSTER VERSION OF STUEY leaps to its feet and snarls down at the biker. The biker pulls a switchblade and jams it into Stuey monster's leg--the blade crumples on his armor-like hide. Stuey grins and SLAM! He drives the biker into the ground like a railroad spike. He leaps onto the stage and stalks Elijah. \nSTUEY MONSTER YOUR ASS IS MINE, SKUGGS! \nRick and the freaks in the cage cheer stuey Monster on. \nELIJAH Uh-oh, that kid looks pissed. EYE AND EYE! KILL HIM! \nEye and Eye rush the stage, Uzis firing. \nEYE AND EYE RASTAFARI! \nThe bullets bounce off Stuey's hide. He doinks them with his big monster fingers and sends them flying through... \nTHE TENT ROOF \nacross the compound, and THWOPP! Into the Giant Head's eye sockets, where they spin around and come to a stop, cockeyed. CRASH! The head's foundation crumbles and it keels over backwards. \nINT. CARNIVAL TENT \nElijah calls out to Toad. \nELIJAH TOAD! \nStuey Monster roars at Toad. Toad smiles weakly. \nTHE TENT ROOF \nToad catapults through it, follows the path of Eye and Eye across the compound and CRASH! Lands head first into the neck of the Giant Head. He gets up with the Giant Head stuck on his own head, making him look like one of those big headed caricatures. He runs blindly across the yard and into... \nTHE ELECTRIC FENCE \nZZZAAAAPPP! BOINNGG! Eye and Eye zing out of the sockets, and Toad's tongue sticks ten feet out of the Giant Head's mouth. It's the biggest Tex Avery cartoon take ever! \nELIJAH \nlooks worried. He scoops up some \"evil ointment\". \nELIJAH Looks like it's time to roll out the big gun. (TO RICK) Sayonara, kiddo. Any last words? \nRick considers it. He can't think of anything. \nRICK Nahh. \nELIJAH Suit yourself. \nHe raises the ointment over Rick. Rick has an idea for a last word. \n", "test1_input": "RICK Yeah, why? \nX-RAY CHECKER Is this your kid? \nHe indicates the X-ray monitor, where we see the skeleton outline of a BUCKTOOTHED, BESPECTACLED 10 YEAR OLD KID curled up in Rick's bag. The kid waves. Rick and Ernie look at each other in horror. \nRICK/ERNIE Stuey Gluck! \nThe bag bursts open, and out pops STUEY GLUCK, an obsessive young autograph hound toting a stack of scrapbooks and memorabilia. \nSTUEY Rick! Rick! Look! I got a rare still from your high school production of The Glass Menagerie! Could you sign it for me? Please?! \nRICK NO! (TO ERNIE) Let's get the hell out of here! \nErnie nods and yanks the bag away from under Stuey. They run away down the corridor. Stuey chases them, holding up an 8 by 10 photo. \nSTUEY Rick! Wait up! \nFURTHER DOWN THE CORRIDOR \nRick and Ernie run around a corner with Stuey in pursuit. \nSTUEY Rick! Remember the speech you gave at the Actors Forum for Social Justice!? \nHe holds up a cassette player and hits play. It's Rick's old speech. \nRICK'S VOICE (FROM TAPE) If all the world is a stage, then let us shine the spotlight on truth, integrity, and a deep compassion for all life. \nRICK Leave me alone, troll! (TO ERNIE) That was before I got an entertainment lawyer. \nERNIE Quick, down here. \nErnie leads Rick down an adjacent hallway. \nIN THE HALLWAY \nIt's a dead end. Rick and Ernie are trapped. Ernie gives Rick a sheepish look. Stuey stands at the entrance of the hallway. He holds up a Time magazine. \nSTUEY Rick! Rick! It says here Noxon's dangerous. Why are you lending your name to it? What's happened to you, Rick? You used to be good! And now... I just don't know... \nStuey starts to cry. Rick looks guilty. \nRICK Don't cry, Stuey, I'm still good. \nBAM! A passing electric baggage cart nails Stuey at full speed and carries him off down the corridor, screaming bloody murder. \nRICK ALRIGHT! \nRick and Ernie high five. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FIRST CLASS CABIN - DAY \nA SEXY STEWARDESS pours champagne for Rick and Ernie. The anarchist sits nearby with the bomb on his lap. Rick winks suggestively at the stewardess. She walks off, obviously not interested. Rick raises his glass to Ernie, oozing sleazy confidence. \nRICK In the bag. \nThe plane hits turbulence, and Rick's drink flies up out of his glass--he catches it as it comes down. Another STEWARDESS helps the Anarchist put his bomb in the overhead compartment. Ernie ogles her. She sneers at him. We hear the CAPTAIN'S voice on the loudspeaker. \nCAPTAIN (V.0.) Ladies and gentlemen, this is your captain speaking. To the right of the aircraft, you can see a great view of the Grand Canyon. \nAll the passengers crane their necks to the right. \nCAPTAIN (V.0.) And to the left you can see a panic- stricken little troll. \nRick turns to his window and flings open the shade to reveal... \nSTUEY \non the wing, pressing his face up against the glass. He's holding up a publicity shot of Rick and screaming something we can't hear. \nRICK AHHHHHHH! \n", "test1_true": "Relieved, he turns nonchalantly to Ernie, ignoring the other horrified passengers. \nRICK You gonna eat your peanuts, Ernie? \nERNIE Nah, you can have 'em. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FARM DAY \nA large haystack sits in the middle of a field. We hear Stuey's approaching scream. \nSTUEY (O.S.) AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH... \nTHUD! Stuey misses the haystack by a few feet. He hops to his feet and dusts himself off. \nSTUEY Hey, I'm okay! \nBONK! His scrapbook falls into frame and beans him. \nSTUEY OW! \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SANTA FLAN AIRPORT - DAY \nWe see the airliner lowering its landing gear as it makes its final approach to the runway. \nRICK (VO) Here we are Ernie, Santa Spam. World famous for loud music and hot sex! \nERNIE (VO) It is? \nRICK (VO) Give me a few hours. \nKA-BLOOEY! The plane explodes in a fireball. Swish-pan to reveal... \nRICK AND ERNIE \nStanding just outside the airport. A porter follows with their bags. \nRICK Sure glad that wasn't our plane. \nErnie nods. They're distracted by the sound of chanting. They squint into the distance, where they see a group of chanting PROTESTERS--young \"Save the Earth\" types, latter-day hippies, kids, seniors, etc. \nPROTESTERS EES mustn't stay! Take your toxic crap away! EES mustn't stay! (etc.) \nSome of their signs read--\"Say No to Noxon!\", \"Coogan Go Home\", \"EES is killing our Earth!\", \"Ricky Coogan Sucks Shit\" (this one held by a nice LITTLE GIRL), \"I Like Ike\" (held by a confused OLD MAN, shuffling around aimlessly), \"Drink Pepsi\" and finally... \n\"Free Nelson Mandela\"--we WIDEN to reveal the subheading: \"Inside specially marked boxes.\" We keep WIDENING to reveal that this is not on a protest placard, but a box of cereal some GUY is eating as he watches the protest. \nERNIE Jesus! We better find the limo before these whale kissers chop us up and sell us for parts. (he spots the limo) There it is. \nOff to the side, away from the protesters, an unmarked limo with tinted windows (and plates that say NOT EES) awaits. KEVIN, an EES exec, leans out the window and waves discreetly at Ricky. The stewardesses, looking tipsy, wave their bras out the back window invitingly. \nErnie tries to grab Ricky by the arm, but he resists. He's looking at the protesters. \nRICK Wait a second... \nHis POV... \nA BEAUTIFUL YOUNG WOMAN \nstanding in the center of the crowd of protesters, holding a MEGAPHONE to her mouth and chanting. She puts down the megaphone to rest, and we can see that she's powerfully beautiful, in a no-nonsense feminist kind of way. This is JULIE. Rick is smitten. \nERNIE Let's go, Rick. They're waitin'. \nRICK Forget them. I got a better idea. If I can just find the right disguise... \nERNIE Coog, those hippies'll tear us apart. \nRick spots a HEAVILY BANDAGED MAN limping out of the airport on crutches. Rick approaches him, waving a roll of bills. \nRICK Hey, how'd you like to make a quick hundred bucks? \n", "test1_id": 339, "test2_input": "flips Stuey onto the ground and starts stomping on him. Stuey is knocked out cold. Rick leaves him on the floor and stalks the freak cage murderously. \nRICK MONSTER NOW I RIP FREAKS TO PIECES! \nJIMIE No! We're your friends! \nRICK MONSTER Oh. NOW I RIP FRIENDS TO PIECES! \nHe rips some bars off the cage and is about to spear JulieErnie with a jagged steel bar when Stuey Monster grabs his leg and trips him. Stuey summons all his remaining energy to wrestle Rick, delaying him, for the moment, from slaughtering the freaks. \nMeanwhile, Elijah is watching as \nTHE EES BLOB \nsolidifies into... A GIANT SHOE made of living flesh. It's got eyeballs where the eyes should be, a tongue where the tongue should be, but it's helpless and immobile. \nElijah looks at it with pride. He does his best Ed Sullivan IMPRESSION: \nELIJAH Now that's a really, really big shoe. Ha-ha-ha-ha! Hmmm, I think I'd like a pair of those! \nHe swivels the nozzle turret towards the cage full of freaks and is about to glop them when Rick stands up above Stuey, blocking Elijah's trajectory at the freak cage. Rick raises the jagged bar above Stuey, ready to drive it down through his chest. \nELIJAH (to Rick monster) Would you hurry up and waste the troll, please!? I got a lonely shoe over here! \nRick Monster nods and drives the spear down when we... \nCUT TO: \nINT. REGIS & KATHIE LEE SHOW SET \nRick's silhouette (which matches his ten foot monster incarnation) is immersed in the story. \nRICK And then... \nKATHIE LEE Sorry to interrupt Rick, but you've been talking for almost ninety minutes, and we've just got to go to a commercial. \nRICK Sorry. \nREGIS We'll be right back after this, folks. \nCUT TO: \nPRODUCT SHOT \nA fine array of different kinds of cheese on a chopping block. \nTOUGH VOICED ANNCR You like cheese. You like being a man. That's why you like.. \nA BURLY HAND swipes all the cheese off the block and slams down an aluminum can labeled \"MACHEESMO.\" \nTOUGH VOICED ANNCR Macheesemo. Real cheese for real men. Now in a handy aluminum dispenser. \nThe hand crushes the can and gooey yellow cheese squirts out the top. \nCUT TO: \nINT. REGIS & KATHIE LEE SHOW SET \nWe hear a music bite from \"Le Freak.\" \nKATHIE LEE And now back to the exciting conclusion of Ricky Coogan's incredible story. \nRICK Well, let's see, the other freaks were lined up in Elijah's sights, and I was about to shove a pipe through Stuey's skull, when all of a sudden, I heard a voice... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CARNIVAL TENT - NIGHT \nRick stops the spear inches from Stuey's chest. Their eyes meet. \nELIJAH Kill him! Kill him! \nElijah's bloodthirsty goading fades away, and Cowboy's voice reverberates in Rick's head. \n", "test2_true": "The voice keeps echoing. A tear wells up in Rick Monster's eye. He looks over at Cowboy, who is actually calling out to him from the cage. \nCOWBOY Your heart... your heart... your heart... \nRick Monster loses his murderous glare. He breaks into a warm smile, throws the pipe away and helps Stuey Monster up. They hug. The rest of the Freaks cheer wildly. \nERNIE Atta' boy Coog! (NUDGES WORM) Hey, ain't that somethin'? \nThe Worm is gushing sentimentally. He tries to hide his tears. \nWORM Tosh. (Sniff) Sentimental claptrap (Sniff) Shameless, maudlin--Baaa! \nHe can't hold it in anymore. He bawls like a baby. Meanwhile, Elijah is hopping mad. \nELIJAH Cut the lovey-dovey bullshit, and start mutilating each other! \nHe aims at Rick Monster and presses the fire button. The Glop starts to flow, but before it can make it out of the tip, Rick grabs hold of the nozzle, and twists it around to face Elijah. \nRICK Raarrrrrrgh! \nElijah manages to duck just in time. A stream of yellow Noxon 25 glop flies over his shoulder, and lands in the DUNK TANK full of carbolic acid that sits off to one side of the tent. \nThe acid and the Noxon mix together and bubble up menacingly. \nElijah hops down out of the gunner's chair and squares off against Rick Monster. \nMeanwhile, Stuey Monster has released the other freaks from the cage. They watch the confrontation from a distance. \nElijah rolls up his sleeves. Rick growls and advances slowly. \nELIJAH You think I made you strong? HA! I've cranked my DNA up so high, you won't know what hit you. I'm a wrecking machine! Aaaaaaa! \nHe rushes at Rick and delivers a flurry of punches to his mid section. They have absolutely no effect. Rick brings one heavy fist slamming down on Elijah's head, stopping him cold. \nELIJAH (WEAKLY) Ow! I think you crushed my spinal cord. I can't feel anything in my fingers. \nRICK Maybe you'll feel this ... \nRick rears back to kick him. \nELIJAH Qait--if you kill me, you'll never find the antidote. \nThe freaks all perk up. Rick's skeptical. \nRICK What antidote? \nELIJAH A time release serum--I baked it into a delicious batch of macaroons. \nA slow smile grows on the Freaks' faces, especially Rick's. \nRICK If you ask me, you skimped on the coconut! \nTHWAK! Rick boots Elijah between the legs, sending him flying through the air. He lands on the DUNK TANK SEAT over the bubbling Noxon/Acid. Dazed, he looks at the bullseye target, and back at Rick. Summoning up his last ounce of bravado, Elijah makes a last stand. \nELIJAH Come on, Coogan! Come oooon! You haven't got the guts to kill me! Go on! I dare ya'! \nRick ponders for a second. He looks over to Julie. Then... \nSCRAPPY Yap! Yap! \nRICK Scrappy! \nScrappy the dog rushes in. He leaps up and presses the bullseye, dropping Elijah into the hideous mixture. \nELIJAH AAAAAAAARRRRRRGGGGGHHHH! \nElijah struggles in agony. His body bubbles and mutates in the thick toxic soup. He sinks lower and lower into the gunk, until he and his cries are buried for good. \nScrappy leaps into Rick's arms and licks his face. \nSCRAPPY Yap! \nRICK Atta boy, Scrap! \n", "test2_id": 340, "test3_input": "BLAM! BLAM! The tent flaps fly open and a half dozen FBI AGENTS rush in with guns drawn. \nFBI CHIEF Freeze, FBI! \nAnother FBI GUY investigates the dunk tank, sees Elijah's hat floating on top of the bubbling ooze. \nANOTHER FBI GUY Looks like they took care of Skuggs, chief. \nThe chief nods. They put away their guns, and approach Rick and the rest of the jubilant freaks. \nCHIEF Nice work, Ricky. You'll get a medal from the Vice President for this. \nRICK Great. But how did you-- \nCHIEF We've been following Skuggs for years. Scrappy just filled in some of the details. \nSCRAPPY Yap! \nFBI CHIEF Thank heavens you brought him to justice, Rick. God only knows how far his sick plans would've gone. \nANOTHER FBI GUY Hey chief, look at this! \nThe FBI guy has peeled the decal off the Pepsi machine, revealing that it's actually a Coke machine! The chief is sickened to the core. \nFBI CHIEF Is nothing sacred? \nSuddenly, the agents are distracted by a terrible scream. They turn to the dunk tank and are shocked by what they see. \nFBI CHIEF Oh, my Lord! \nRICK No! It can't be! \nWe SWISH PAN over to reveal a DRIPPING BLOB climbing out of the dunk tank. The blob separates into two distinct entities with their backs to us. They turn around and...my God it's... it's.... \nREGIS AND KATHIE LEE! \nOr at least a damn fine mutant imitation of them. Call him/them ELIJUS and ELLY LEE. They both have glowing red demon eyes and speak in Elijah's voice. \nELIJUS Thought you killed me, huh? \nELLY LEE What the hell are you looking at? \nFBI CHIEF Two pieces of deadmeat! \nBLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The FBI guys open fire. We show only the horrified reactions of the freaks as they look on. \nCUT TO: \nINT. REGIS AND KATHIE LEE SET \nRick, Regis, and Kathie Lee are still in silhouette. \nRICKY And that's my story. \nKATHIE LEE (YAWN) It was so exciting! \nREGIS And long! My God! It makes War and Peace sound like a warm up act! \nCREW GUY(O.S.) Okay! We got light! \nREGIS It's fixed? Well, it's about time! \nThe lights come on--no more silhouettes. Ricky looks perfectly normal, his old self. His weird silhouette was caused by a potted plant and some strange hanging mobile behind him. \nRICKY That's better. \nREGIS I'll say. (TO AUDIENCE) How 'bout it, folks. Let's hear it for Ricky Coogan! \nThe audience applauds and hoots wildly. \nKATHIE LEE Can we bring out the other freaks now? \nThe audience cheers as the rest of the Freaks walk out from the wings, and stand off to the side waving to the audience. They all look clean cut and happy. They wear T-shirts with their former identities printed on them. \"I was NOSEY,\" \"I was COWBOY,\" \"I was the BEARDED LADY\" etc. Except the Worm, who's still a worm. His T-shirt says, \"I'm Still THE WORM\". \n", "test3_true": "Suddenly a squirrel runs across stage, followed by Juan. He pounces and catches the furry little bugger. \nJUAN Gotcha! Damn, it's about time! \nALL THE EX-FREAKS (happy to see him) JUAN! \nJUAN Hey guys! Jeez! You look great! \nThey all hug. \nREGIS That's just great. What a story. And what an ending! Elijah transformed by the goop! \nKATHIE LEE And he really looked like--? \nRICK Exactly like you two, I swear. Same faces, same outfits, except they had these really big, hideous feet... \nHe looks down at Regis and KATHIE LEE's feet--they're big, hideous monster feet! Suddenly their eyes glow bright red-- It's Elijus and Elly Lee! They speak with Elijah's voice. \nELIJUS Show's over, Ricky! \nELLY LEE I'm gonna drink your blood! \nElly Lee pulls a machete and is about to force it down on Rick's throat when... \nBANG! BANG! BANG! Elijus and Elly Lee's eyes go funny. They look at each other, spit up some blood, wave to the audience one last time, and collapse to the floor. Julie stands behind them, smoking gun in hand. She rushes to Rick. They embrace. \nJULIE Rick! It's finally over! \nRICK Yes... Yes it is. \nSTUEY(O.C.) Rick! Rick! \nRick and Julie turn and see Stuey, still a ten foot tall monster, running towards them. He's carrying a garbage bag dripping blood. \nRICK Stuey! \nSTUEY Look! I found the real Regis and Kathie Lee! \nRick and Julie look at the bag, mortified. Stuey chuckles. \nSTUEY (CONT'D) No, this is just my lunch! \nRick and Julie sigh with relief. Stuey pulls out a similar leaking bag and holds it up. \nSTUEY (matter of fact) This is Regis and Kathie Lee. \nRick and Julie nod casually--\"Oh.\" \nAUDIENCE Awwww! \nSuddenly Elijus and Elly Lee pop up from behind the couch, bloodied, but still fierce. They're about to stab Rick and Julie when... \nBANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! BANG! Five more shots ring out and they fall dead--again. \nErnie stands off to the side with a smoking gun. \nERNIE Oh, like that wasn't totally predictable. \nJULIE Well, now it really is over. \nSappy END OF THE MOVIE MUSIC wells up. \nRICK Thank God. You know, this adventure has taught me something. (MORE) RICK(CONT'D) When man starts impinging on the subtle perfection of the earth's natural order, the only thing he'll create is havoc. \nERNIE Right, Coog. I learned somethin' too. That men and women truly are equals. That the human spirit transcends gender and physical appearance, and thus it is immune to the petty degradations men may devise. I believe it was Moliere WHO SAID-- \nJulie's had enough. She socks Ernie square on the jaw. \nJULIE Oh, shut up. (She turns to Rick) Let's go fuck. \nRick gives her the thumbs up. They turn to the audience. \nRICK/JULIE/ERNIE/STUEY MONSTER Good night, everybody! \n", "test3_id": 341}

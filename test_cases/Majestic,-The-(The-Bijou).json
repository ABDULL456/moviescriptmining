{"train": "THE BIJOU (The Majestic) by Michael Sloane \nTHE BIJOU \nby \nMichael Sloane \nREVISED DRAFT \nOctober 14, 1997 \n\"... the magic is all around you. All the time.  Everywhere. In every thing. The trick... is to see it.\" \nIN BLACK... \n... the insistent, persistent, eight-to-the-bar beat of BOOGIE-WOOGIE.  Hot, exciting, pulsating rhythm, ramping up. \nTHEN... \n... in the blackness, falling s-l-o-w-l-y, tumbling g-e-n-t-l-y, a picture-postcard: \n\"GREETINGS FROM HOLLYWOOD!\" \nThen another... and another, each one dropping through frame, a gentle rain. \nIn these old postcards, Hollywood is a dream town where movie stars glide out of big cars to press their hands-and- footprints in the wet cement. \nAnother postcard: \n\"I'M MEETING THE STARS AT HOLLYWOOD & VINE!\" \nIn this postcard myth, you'd toddle down to Hollywood and Vine, bump into Bogie and Bacall, and join them for dinner at the Brown Derby.  Or Ciro's.  Or the Coconut Grove... \nMore postcards.  Pictures of movie theaters, but not the ones that you and I know today.  These are palaces.  Temples. Grauman's Chinese and Egyptian.  The Carthay Circle.  The Paramount, the Million Dollar.  From a time when moviegoing was a complete experience, not a trip to the local mall.  The ushers were friendly and helpful and wore gold brocaded jackets and guided you to your seat.  The popcorn was hot and fresh and buttered with real butter, not 30-weight motor oil. \nCUT TO: \nTHE PILE OF POSTCARDS \na wild jumble.  Then, one LAST POSTCARD drops lazily on top of the pile.  It's a view of Hollywood at night, a carpet of lights under the yawning, protective smile of Mt. Lee's most famous resident, the fully-lit HOLLYWOOD SIGN.  We PUSH INTO THE PICTURE OF THE SIGN, DISSOLVING UNTIL WE'RE... \n... PUSHING INTO THE REAL HOLLYWOOD SIGN, closer and closer, until we fly right through it -- then crazily loop up and behind it until we're looking down at... \nEXT.  HOLLYWOOD (AERIAL VIEW) - NIGHT \nSUPER TITLE: 1951 \nA gigantic aerial shot.  Postwar autos fill the muggy midsummer evening air with the sounds of thousands of HONKING HORNS, a mere precursor to the traffic yet to come.  Darkened outlying neighborhoods are evidence of the postwar home construction boom, as scores of stucco bungalows are being built in the areas surrounding the beating heart of the town, a swath of garishly bright concrete called \nHOLLYWOOD BOULEVARD. \nPETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Of course, it's not like the postcards say it is.  This is what it's like.  I'm Pete Appleton, and this is my town. \nStill in the same shot, we rocket down into the center of the intersection of Hollywood and Vine, then head west along the boulevard, skimming just above the traffic -- past Musso and Frank's Grill and the Hollywood Canteen, past the Egyptian Theater and a rumbling Pacific Electric Red Car, across Highland Avenue, past the Paramount Theater, and across the street to \nGRAUMAN'S CHINESE THEATER. \nPETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Born and raised here, thank you very much.  Sometimes, it seems like everyone here is from somewhere else.  But everyone loves the movies, so Hollywood is everyone's town, and they come here by the busload.  To them, Grauman's Chinese Theater is just about the most exciting place on the planet. To me, it's the theater that's playing \"The African Queen.\" \nAnd like the man said, the film on the marquee is \"THE AFRICAN QUEEN.\"  Still the same shot, buses disgorge TOURISTS, who move into the forecourt of the theater.  The MEN doff their hats and mop their brows.  The WOMEN pull their blouses away from their chests, fanning themselves with movie-star maps as they marvel at the signed cement blocks. We MOVE AMONG THEM, until we pick up A COUPLE, and we stay behind them as they work their way through the crowd, on their way to \nTHE THEATER ENTRANCE, \nwhere an ornately attired DOORMAN smiles and tears their tickets. \nDOORMAN Newsreel's just starting, folks. \nPETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) That's me and my girlfriend.  Her name is Sandra Sinclair, and this is her town, too -- she's from Cleveland.  She came out here to be an actress, and that's just what she's doing.  The first picture I ever wrote, a little potboiler called \"Sand Pirates of the Sahara.\"  Okay, it ain't \"Citizen Kane,\" but you gotta start somewhere. \nMOVING INTO THE LOBBY \nan explosion of glitz mixed with Chinese myth and legend. Everywhere you look, it's red and orange and plush carpeting and golden light.  We MOVE THROUGH the lobby, still in the same shot, still tracking the couple, heading for the auditorium doors, which are swept open by two ramrod-erect USHERS and we move into \nTHE DARKENED THEATER. \nAs the couple, Pete and Sandra, find seats, we HEAR the soundtrack of the film before we see the screen, the unmistakable strains of a march, and then -- still in the same shot -- we see the screen... \nA NEWSREEL. \nAs the march SWELLS to a crescendo, we HEAR THE NEWSREEL ANNOUNCER'S SONOROUS VOICE: \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER Bringing the news of the world to you! \nOver a newsreel shot of a packed Congressional Committee Hearing Room, a title blares \"HOLLYWOOD REDS GO TO JAIL!\" \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER Four years ago, in one of filmland's darkest hours, ten men, the so-called \"Hollywood Ten,\" were called to testify before the House Committee of Un-American Activities, investigating the proliferation of the dreaded Red Menace in Hollywood. \nWe see several shots of WITNESSES engaged in heated verbal battles with congressmen, especially Committee Chairman T. JOHNSTON DOYLE and the Majority Counsel, ELVIN CLYDE. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER Refusing to answer the lawmaker's questions, cowering behind the Fifth Amendment's protection against self-incrimination, the ten motion picture writers dared Congress to come after them.  Well, come after them they did!  And after years of court wrangling, it's now time to pay the piper! \nOver shots of several of the \"Hollywood Ten\" being led to jail in handcuffs, the newsreel narration continues. \nNEWSREEL ANNOUNCER And so, it's off to jail, the charge: Contempt of Congress!  This should give you fellas something to write about now!  A new round of investigations begins this fall, the mandate: Get the reds out of Hollywood! \nIn the audience, one man YELLS \"Lock up the commie bastards!,\" and a few others cheer and laugh.  As the newsreel moves on to a somewhat more innocuous subject, we WHEEL AROUND AND... \nENDFRAME ON PETE APPLETON AND SANDRA SINCLAIR. \nPETE (frustrated) What?  That I'm accused of being a communist when I don't happen to be one? \nLEO They know you were at that meeting, Peter.  They've been told, and they know. \nPETE Leo, you're my agent.  Tell \"them\" to take a flyin' piss.  I didn't do anything wrong.  I fought in the war, for crissakes! \nLEO Fought?  Come on, Pete, you ran the PX at Fort Dix. \nPETE I was decorated. \nLEO I know.  A Purple Heart. \nPETE Exactly. \nLEO You broke your arm.  You were coming out of a bar.  You were drunk. \nPETE At least I was on our side!  Look, they want me to testify?  I'll testify.  I'll tell 'em anything they want to hear!  Jesus, Leo, this is my career! \nLEO You can't testify. \nPETE Why not? \nLeo takes a gold cigarette care from his breast pocket, offers a cigarette to Pete and takes one for himself. \nLEO Don't take this personally, kid. If it were up to me, I'd have you testify wearing your uniform and your medal, wrapped in a flag with one hand on your heart and the other hand on a bible.  What can I say?  I like you. \nLeo lights Pete's cigarette and his own.  Puts a fatherly hand on his shoulder. \nLEO They don't want you to testify because you're not a big enough fish for them.  They just don't want you writing pictures for now. That's all. \nPETE (under his breath) Yeah, well, that's enough. \nLEO Peter, I believe in you.  More to the point, I read your new script... um... \nPETE \"Ashes To Ashes?\" \nLEO That's the one, \"Ashes To Ashes.\" I think it's great.  But it'll never get made with this communist business hanging over your head. You can't work until you're cleared -- and believe me, starting right now, I'm gonna do everything I can to make that happen. \nPETE So, it is a blacklist. \nLEO (defensive) Don't say that.  There is no such thing as a blacklist. (calm) Now, are you gonna play ball? \nPETE (sullenly) Yes. (then, pissed) Leo, goddammit... this isn't fair! \nLeo blows out a thin stream of smoke. \nLEO (hand on Pete's shoulder) Kid, this is the United States Government we're talkin' about. Fair ain't the point. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  WRITER'S BUILDING/PETE'S OFFICE - DAY \nProminent on the wall is a framed \"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA\" poster.  Pete reaches up and takes it down.  He leans it up against the desk, then sits heavily in the wooden swivel chair.  He swivels around to see \nA STUDIO SECURITY GUARD \nstanding by the door.  He's watching Pete's every move. \nTwo boxes sit on the desk, partially packed with Pete's belongings.  Pete lights a cigarette and opens the lower desk drawer.  He pulls out a stack of scripts and sets them on the desk.  He looks at the cover of the first one: \n\"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA\" By Peter Appleton A United Pictures Production February 19, 1951 \nPete shuffles the scripts and looks at the cover of the second one: \n\"ASHES TO ASHES\" By Peter Appleton \nHe jams the scripts into one box and turns to the other box, which contains somewhat more personal items.  A ragged gold pillow with tassels.  Legal pads of notes.  An old tin-toy fire truck, its bright red paint chipped and worn.  He turns it around in his hands. \nPETE (musing) Huh.  Red... \nFootsteps approach, and Pete swivels toward the door. \nSANDRA (O.S.) Pete?  Pete...? \nSandra appears in the doorway.  She's in costume -- a Louis XIV courtier.  She bustles past the Guard, rushes to Pete and embraces him. \nSANDRA Oh, Pete... \nThey kiss.  The Guard watches their every move. \nSANDRA What happened? \nPETE What exactly did you hear? \nSANDRA That you got let go. \nPETE I wasn't alone.  Wasn't Frankie Ruskin directing the picture you're in? \nSANDRA He was, but he got sick.  We got a new director today.  Why? \nPETE Well, whatever Frankie's got, it's catching. \nSANDRA You mean, he was... let go, too? \nPETE (sotto, an appeal) They're saying I'm a communist, Sandy.  But I'm not, you know that. I'm gonna fight 'em, and I'm gonna win, but I'll need your help. \nDuring this last, Sandra has been ever-so-slightly pulling away from Pete. \nPETE A lot of good people are being accused of things they didn't do. Hell, even if I was a communist, this is America, goddammit, a person should be able to be whatever they want to be!  Right? \nPETE Oops. \nHe re-starts the car, puts it in gear, and pulls away and down the deserted boulevard. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  SANTA MONICA BEACH, AMUSEMENT PIER - NIGHT \nThe full moon is low over the ocean.  Pete's car is parked at the edge of the sand, the water fifty yards away.  The ferris wheel and the roller coaster of the amusement pier are dark and eerie silhouettes, lit only by moonlight.  Pete is asleep in the driver's seat, head tilted back, his hat covering his face, snoring. \nThe waves CRASH against the pilings and startle Pete awake. \nPETE Huh?  Whatsa... \nInstantly, he grabs his head. \nPETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) I had no idea how I got to Santa Monica, but it certainly was a good idea.  I don't think I could've faced the headache I had alone in my apartment.  At least I had the ocean air. \nPete takes a deep breath... and starts coughing.  He gets out his cigarettes and lights up.  He takes a puff and glances at his watch. \nPETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Three forty-five.  I had only been there for a couple of hours at most.  Truth be told, I was still fairly drunk. \nHe starts the car and heads for the highway. \nPETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) I'd head north until the sun came up or I ran out of gas, whichever came first. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  PACIFIC COAST HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nPete drives along the moonlit two-lane blacktop.  Waves crash to the shore below the roadway. \nINT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT \nPete is finally relaxed.  He takes off his hat and jams it down in the back seat.  He takes a deep breath -- with the wind in his hair, a smile grows on his face and he seems at peace.  He glances down at the speedometer -- then at the fuel gauge. \nINSERT - FUEL GAUGE \nPinning on \"empty.\" \nPETE Shit. \nPETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Guess which came first. \nHe scans the road ahead -- nothing.  Glances to his right. \nPETE'S POV \nThe lights of a small town can be seen off in the distance. \nPete veers the car off the highway and makes the turn that will take him toward the lights.  He passes a hand-painted sign that gives him hope: \"GAS - 1 MI.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  RORY'S GAS STATION - NIGHT \nPete's car rolls up and stops.  There's a light on the sign and another in the station's window, but the place is deserted. \nPETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) I should've known better than to think that a service station in the sticks would be open at this hour, but it wasn't like I had a lot of choices. \nPete looks ahead toward the town.  Its few lights twinkle in the distance. \nPETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) What the hell.  At least there'd be a diner opening in a couple of hours.  I'd get some pie and coffee, and then I could worry about the gas. \nPete pulls out onto the road. \nEXT.  ROAD - NIGHT \nPete's car trundles along, blowing past a hand-painted roadside sign which reads: \nSLOW! NARROW BRIDGE - SINGLE LANE - NO GUARDRAIL USE CAUTION! \nINT./ EXT.  PETE'S CAR (DRIVING) - NIGHT \nPete's headlights catch a glimpse of another sign, reading \"LAWSON WASH,\" just in front of a small wooden auto bridge. \nBarely reducing his speed, Pete heads onto the bridge... \nHIS POV - THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD \n... his headlights pick up the glowing eyes of a hapless possum... \nPete swerves to avoid the animal, and a wheel drops off the edge... \nEXT.  BRIDGE - NIGHT \n... and the Plymouth careens over the side of the bridge and into the rapidly-moving water below! \nEXT.  UNDERWATER - NIGHT \nThe water is flowing very quickly, and the current is intense.  Pete pulls himself out of the driver's seat (thankfully, it's a convertible) and swims over the windshield. \nBut... his left sleeve is caught on the door handle.  Nearly out of breath and panicking, Pete shucks off the jacket and heads for the surface. \nEXT.  THE WASH - NIGHT \nPete breaks the surface and gasps for air.  His fight isn't over yet, as the current is pulling him rapidly downstream. He swims with all his might toward the far bank. \nEXT.  FAR BANK OF THE WASH - NIGHT \nA typical small-town greasy spoon -- with one faded star prominent in the window. \nCLOSER \nOn MABEL LANIER, a sweet-faced woman in her 30s.  She stares vacantly into space, her reverie broken by a customer needing a coffee refill. \nSTANTON All told, this little town gave sixty-two of its finest to the war. Seventeen of 'em at Normandy alone. More'n its share, I should say. Got us a letter from President Truman.  City council commissioned a war memorial.  Been sittin' in the basement of city hall these six years.  Town never had the heart to put it up.  Place just hasn't been the same since the war. \nSTANTON AND PETE \nPete looks longingly toward the diner.  Stanton takes note. \nSTANTON You hungry, son? \nPETE Yes.  Very. \nSTANTON Got any money? \nPete rummages in his pants pockets, and comes up with three quarters. \nSTANTON Six bits.  More'n enough to buy some breakfast.  C'mon. \nAnd they head across the street. \nCUT TO: \nA PLATE WITH TWO PIECES OF APPLE PIE \nA fork comes into frame and tears into one of the slices. \nWIDER \nINT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY \nPete is fairly shoveling the pie into his mouth, pausing only to wash it down with gulps of coffee. \nMABEL \nstands nearby, watching in amazement as her pie is consumed in record time. \nPete notices that Stanton and Mabel -- and the other PATRONS, for that matter -- are watching his feeding frenzy.  He stops in his tracks, and starts chewing leisurely.  He smiles at Mabel. \nPETE (mouth full) Pie's... good. \nMABEL (wryly) Like you could tell. (to Stanton) Where'd you find him? \nSTANTON Down by the wash. \nMABEL We gotta put a rail on that thing before someone else gets killed. (to Pete) Three people have died there, Mister.  You're lucky to be alive. \nPETE (draining the coffee cup) Thanks.  More coffee? \nMabel obliges.  As she pours the coffee, she looks at Pete. \nMABEL You know, you look familiar.  You ever been in here before? \nPete shakes his head. \nSTANTON He don't remember who he is, Mabel. Gonna take him to the Doc, as soon as he gets in. \nMABEL (distractedly) Doc should be in for his coffee and bear claw any minute... (to Pete) You sure you never been in here? \nPete looks up at Mabel and smiles winningly. \nPETE I'd remember this pie. \nMabel, thoroughly charmed, smiles back at Pete. \nMABEL (patting his hand) I'll just get you another piece. \nEXT.  COMMERCE STREET - DAY \nA stoop-shouldered little man in his late 60s, HARRY TRUMBO shambles along the street, headed for Mabel's Diner.  There's a sadness about Harry, the world-weary melancholy of a man who has little to smile about because he has little to care about.  After a couple of steps, he's met up by DOC BEN LARDNER, a vigorous man in his 50s.  He comes up behind Harry and claps him on the back. \nLARDNER 'Mornin' Harry.  Fine day, isn't it? \nHARRY Morning, Doc.  Yes, yes it looks just fine. \nLARDNER Plenty to do today? \nHARRY (vaguely) Oh, yes, plenty.  Plenty. \nThey're at the door of the diner.  Doc opens it for Harry. \nLARDNER After you. \nINT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY \nLardner comes over to Mabel, who hands him a tall paper cup of coffee and bags him a bear claw. \nLARDNER Mornin' Mabel, Stan. \nMABEL Mornin' Doc.  Got some new business for you today. \nLardner and Pete make eye contact, and the doctor notices the bump on his head. \nLARDNER Hello, son.  How'd that happen? \nSTANTON He don't know.  And he don't know his name, neither.  Found him down by the wash. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY \nLardner is on the phone, sipping his coffee and nibbling his bear claw.  Pete is standing, nosing around the office -- diplomas, photographs, knick-knacks.  He zeros in on one photo in particular. \nON THE PHOTO \none of Lardner and a beautiful YOUNG WOMAN.  They've been fishing, and the young woman displays a much larger catch than Lardner. \nLARDNER (into phone) Stanton found him by the wash.  Not hurt too bad, but he took a nasty bump on the head and he can't remember who he is.  We both think he looks familiar, but we can't place him.  You bet.  He'll be here. \nLardner hangs up and watches Pete looking at the pictures. \nLARDNER That's me and my daughter Adele. My pride and joy.  Charms the fish right out of the lake, she does. \nPETE She's very pretty. \nLARDNER Thanks.  Well, Sheriff's on his way over, and maybe we can get to the bottom of who you are... \nLardner stares at him.  Pete takes note, turns toward him. \nLARDNER ... sorry 'bout that, but you do look familiar to me. \nPETE Wish I could say the same thing. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  DOC LARDNER'S OFFICE - DAY \nThe Sheriff's sedan pulls up to the office and SHERIFF CECIL ELDRIDGE, 45, gets out.  As he gets a few steps from the door, Harry Trumbo jumps out from around the side of the building and stops him. \nHARRY (excited) Cecil!  Cecil, there's a young man in there... \nELDRIDGE (startled) Lord love a duck, Harry, you wanna give me a heart attack right in front of the doctor's office? \nHARRY Listen to me!  The young man in there... \nEldridge keeps moving to the door. \nELDRIDGE (interrupting) Stan Lawson found him unconscious by the wash this morning, and I'm here to investigate, and if we find anything interesting, it'll be in the paper, so why don't you just... \nHarry jumps in front of Eldridge and grabs him by the shoulders. \nHARRY Cecil, listen to me! \nThe sheriff stops. \nHARRY (breathless) It's Luke. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  DOC LARDNER'S PRIVATE OFFICE - DAY \nSheriff Eldridge is seated across from Pete.  He's staring at him intently.  Silence. \nELDRIDGE No wallet, huh? \nLARDNER No identification at all. (beat) What're you thinkin', Cecil? \nELDRIDGE What I'm thinkin' is we got us one a'two things here.  A mystery or a damn miracle.  And by god I can't tell which. (to Pete) Boy, you say you have no idea who you are?  That right? \nPETE Yes. \nELDRIDGE You ever been in this town before, to your knowledge? \nPETE No.  But... \nELDRIDGE But what? \nPETE Well, this place sorta reminds me of something. \nELDRIDGE What's that? \nPETE \"It's a Wonderful Life.\" \nELDRIDGE The Jimmy Stewart picture?  I remember that one.  Saw it over at the Bijou.  So, you remember that, huh? \nPETE \"It's a Wonderful Life?\" \nELDRIDGE Or the Bijou.  Either one. \nPETE I remember the picture... but I don't remember where I saw it. \nThe Sheriff rises and crosses to the door. \nELDRIDGE Doc, with your permission, I want to bring someone in here.  Maybe it'll jar this young man's memory. \nLARDNER By all means. \nEldridge opens the door. \nELDRIDGE (to someone offscreen) Harry, why don't you come on in here. \nHarry enters the office, doffs his hat, revealing a full head of snow-white hair.  He nods to Eldridge and Lardner, and slowly turns to face Pete.  He looks closer... and closer. Hesitantly, he takes a couple of steps towards Pete, who slowly rises out of his chair to meet the old man's gaze. Finally, they're standing practically toe-to-toe. \nPETE \nlooks a bit puzzled, but the old man has such a sweet face... \nHARRY Nine and-a-half years ago. \nLUKE Nine and-a-half years... \nELDRIDGE Comin' up on the Bijou, gents. \nEXT.  IN FRONT OF THE BIJOU - DAY \nEldridge's car rounds the corner, pulls up and stops. \nELDRIDGE Here we are. \nHARRY Well, son, you're home! \nLuke peers across the street... his mouth gapes open... \nHIS POV - THE BIJOU. \nThe Bijou is a decaying, Dada-esque, grab-bag of building styles.  It's as though the architect took random parts of a Chinese temple, a Mosque, a Pagoda, a Sphinx, a symphony hall and a slaughterhouse, put them in a bag, gave it a good shake, tossed the contents out onto a blueprint and promptly built the result. \nAs a matter of fact, if you didn't know that the place was \"The Bijou,\" you'd probably wonder what the cryptic message \n\" HE B J U\" \nwas trying to convey from atop the crumbling parapet. \nAnd now, the reason for the deteriorated state of the \" HE B J U\" sign becomes apparent.  Train tracks run right behind the building on an elevated trestle.  As we watch, a TRAIN ROARS BY.  Everything shakes.  It's not an earthquake, it's a trainquake.  The \"J\" teeters at a jaunty angle, threatening to dislodge and tumble down to join its fallen brothers. \nLUKE \nstares at the monstrosity.  His face is ashen.  His heart has sunk to somewhere below his knees. \nThe Bijou. \nHarry jumps out of the car excitedly. \nHARRY Thanks for the lift, Cecil. \nELDRIDGE Don't mention it.  Welcome home, Luke. \nLUKE (faint smile) Thanks. \nLuke opens the back door and slowly steps out.  Harry grabs his arm and pulls a ring of keys from his pocket. \nHARRY Wait'll you see the inside! \nLUKE (deadpan) Can't wait. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY \nThe interior of the theater fulfills every promise made by the exterior.  Moth-eaten velvet-flocked wallpaper hangs in shards and pieces from the walls.  It's sort of a cross between a gaudy cathouse and a mausoleum, served up with generous helpings of dust and grime, an almost unbeatable combination of questionable taste and neglect. \nAbove the center of the lobby hangs what was -- and is -- probably the only truly beautiful item in the whole theater -- \nA DELICATE CRYSTAL CHANDELIER. \nEven under a veneer of dust, the fragile droplets of cut crystal seem to pick up every available point of light and scatter it in a hundred directions. \nTILT DOWN TO REVEAL \nLuke and Harry standing below.  Luke is lost in a gulf somewhere between surprise and disgust. \nHARRY We've been closed for a while. \nLUKE (smiling wanly) Ah. \nLuke walks toward the auditorium doors and slowly, cracks one open. \nINT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY \nThe ocean of two hundred or so seats on the main floor seem to be, for the most part, intact -- although the occasional row seems to have loosed itself from its moorings and heaved itself up against the row behind or in front. \nTHE SCREEN \nis really not much more than a tatty bit of yellowing muslin, framed by ragged red velveteen drapery. \nIn the tiny orchestra pit, as we will see later, is an old upright piano. \nLuke walks a few steps down the aisle.  He picks a seat on the aisle near the middle of the theater and sits.  As he does, a CAT, an orange tabby, leaps out from under another seat, jets past Luke and disappears down the aisle and backstage.  Harry comes over and sits behind him. \nLUKE (turning to Harry) Exactly how long has the Bijou been closed? \nHARRY Hmmmm... after you left, it was difficult, and then Lily -- that's your mother -- she took ill and died... we haven't shown a picture since forty-eight. \nLUKE Why? \nHARRY (deep breath) Well, after the war, with so many of the town's boys killed, people around here didn't much feel like going to the movies, I guess.  Some of 'em moved away -- Los Angeles, Sacramento, San Francisco.  Wasn't much to keep 'em here, I expect. And now with this \"television\" thing -- people just aren't going out as much as they used to. \nLUKE Didn't you have any help? \nHARRY Oh, I had Irene and Old Tim but they really couldn't help much. Broke their hearts when we closed up.  Broke mine, too. (brightening) But now that you're back, well, things will be different around here, that's for sure. (rises, grabs Luke's arm) C'mon, I'll show you where we live. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BIJOU APARTMENT - DAY \nThe small apartment above the projection booth is quite a contrast to the rest of the theater.  It's neat as a pin, and fairly lit, as Harry has just pulled back the curtains, allowing the sun to flood the room. \nLUKE Is there a young Tim? \nOLD TIM No. \nLUKE Well, then, why do they call you \"Old Tim?\" \nPause. \nOLD TIM I'm old. \nHarry steps forward, takes Luke's arm. \nHARRY Well, lots to do, so we'd better get a move on... \nCUT TO: \nINT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY \nLuke, Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger walk down the aisle toward the screen.  Old Time lags a few steps behind.  At the orchestra pit, Harry climbs the steps, crosses the pit.  The screen is a sea of repair patches.  Harry pats it.  Dust flies. \nHARRY 'Fraid this has seen better days. Well, I was meaning to get a new screen, anyway. \nOLD TIM I n-need me a new uniform. \nLuke looks at Old Tim, then at Harry. \nHARRY (to Luke) I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. (to Old Tim) And you'll get one, too. \nLUKE You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has. \nSilence from the group. \nLUKE I thought so. \nBeat.  Harry brightens, clambers down the steps and races up the aisle. \nHARRY Anyone want to see the projector? \nCUT TO: \nTWO CARBON ARCS \nare squeakily being cranked together above the din of a fan motor.  A puff of smoke, then -- BZZZZZZZZZTT -- LIGHT.  A metal door is closed over the arcs. \nINT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - DAY \nHarry dances around to the other side of the projector and adjusts the focus on the beam of light.  The others look on as he gazes at the screen through the tiny window. \nHARRY Beautiful.  Bright and even from edge to edge.  See for yourself. \nThe carbons sputter and die.  The light flickers out.  Harry is crestfallen, turns off the motor. \nHARRY She's always been a bit tricky. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY \nMrs. Terwilliger is dusting the concession stand with a ragged feather duster, a hopeless task.  Old Tim is on a rickety ladder, replacing burned-out bulbs in the chandelier. The orange tabby cat scratches itself on the leg of the ladder. \nOld Tim climbs down and catches his breath.  Mrs. Terwilliger sneezes. \nOLD TIM Bless. \nMRS. TERWILLIGER Thank you, Timothy. \nThey both stop their work and glance warily at the door marked \"OFFICE.\" \nMRS. TERWILLIGER (sotto) What do you suppose they're talking about? \nOLD TIM Dunno.  Boy's smart. \nMRS. TERWILLIGER (brightly) Yes, he seems to be. \nOLD TIM Bad for us. \nINT.  BIJOU OFFICE - DAY \nLuke is poring over the ledger books, adding up figures on an old manual adding machine. \nLUKE Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here? \nHARRY No, your mother did, then I did after she passed. \nLUKE Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here. \nHe scans down a page. \nLUKE (reading) \"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'\" \nHARRY (appreciatively) Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa. \nLUKE (reading) \"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs.\" \nHe closes the book and looks expectantly at Harry. \nHARRY Yes? \nLUKE \"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?\" \nADELE (extreme concern) Oh my god... who died? \nCUT TO: \nA GLASS OF WATER \non a kitchen table.  Offscreen, we HEAR A HICCUP.  Then another.  Adele's hand reaches into frame. \nWIDER \nINT.  LARDNER KITCHEN - EVENING \nLardner stands over Adele, who is seated at the table, holding the glass of water. \nLARDNER Drink slowly. \nShe raises the glass to her lips. \nLARDNER From the other side of the glass. \nIt's a particularly gymnastic way in which to drink water, but Adele accomplishes it with aplomb.  She waits for a moment -- then hiccups again. \nADELE I think (hic!) it's worse (hic!) now. \nLARDNER That always used to work. \nADELE Yeah, well it's not everyday you get (hic!) news like this.  You're sure he's (hic!) okay?  Other than the (hic!) bump on the head? \nLARDNER (hedging) Well... \nADELE (hic!) Dad... (hic!) \nLardner sits at the table and takes Adele's hand. \nLARDNER He doesn't remember anything, Delly.  Doesn't know how he got here, doesn't remember his father, the town, the Bijou, anyone... \nADELE ... including me.  Right?  (hic!) \nLARDNER I'm afraid not.  He looked right at your picture without batting an eye.  But it's probably temporary. He got all the way to Lawson, so he clearly knew who he was and what he was doing until he hit his head. I'm sure it'll all come back to him.  It just takes a catalyst. \nADELE You mean, (hic!) me? \nLARDNER It's possible. \nOff Adele's thoughtful hiccuping, we \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  COMMERCE STREET - EVENING \nLuke and Harry, walking along, make a turn onto Commerce Street, heading for Mabel's.  It's still light out, and a soft breeze skitters some leaves along the sidewalk. \nHARRY I take breakfast and supper at Mabel's every day except Sunday. Have for years, since Lily died. If it weren't for Mabel, I'd probably starve to death. \nERNIE COLE, a slight, balding man in his 50s, is locking the door of his pharmacy across the street, when he spots Harry and Luke. \nERNIE Harry!  Hold on a second! \nErnie runs across the street and, slightly winded, stands before Luke, staring.  Luke shoots a glance at Harry, who taps Ernie on the shoulder. \nHARRY It's really him, Ernie. \nERNIE (agape) Well, I'll be... \nHe sticks his hand out and Luke takes it.  Ernie pumps it enthusiastically. \nERNIE By god, Luke, if it isn't good to see you again. \nLUKE (uncertain) Uh, thanks.  Good to see you again, too, uh... \nHARRY Ernie. \nLUKE ... Ernie. \nERNIE (still at a lose) Well, I'll be... \nHARRY We were just gonna get some supper. Would you like to join us? \nERNIE Would I ever! \nThe three walk toward the diner, but before they get two steps, they hear: \nWOMAN'S VOICE Is that Luke Trumbo? \nThey turn to see a stout woman, KATIE RUTHERFORD, 40s, rushing toward them.  She rushes right into a very surprised Luke's arms and hugs him tightly. \nKATIE Oh, Luke, it's so good to have you back! \nHARRY Katie, would you like to join us for dinner?  The more, the merrier. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  MABEL'S DINER - NIGHT \nThe diner is packed.  In addition to Ernie and Katie, MEN, WOMEN and CHILDREN occupy every seat and table, and many more are standing, even hanging out the door. \nAt the focus of the crowd are Luke and Harry, seated at the counter.  Harry is leisurely eating a chicken dinner, while Luke is working on a steak.  A young man seated at the opposite side of the counter is speaking.  He's CARL LEFFERT, 30s. \nCARL (eagerly) Hey, Luke, remember the time you and me, we was playing with firecrackers and the one you was lighting blew up too soon and singed all the hair offa my head? \nAdele and Luke stroll down the street side by side.  She looks at him for a long moment. \nLUKE What. \nADELE No, I... I just wondering where you've been all this time. \nLUKE Me too. \nADELE You look... different. \nLUKE I do? \nADELE Yeah, a little.  I think you grew an inch or so.  And you've lost weight. \nLUKE I did?  Huh! \nTentatively, she takes his hand and holds it.  From behind them, we HEAR A SHUFFLING SOUND.  Adele turns... \nADELE'S POV \nKeeping a discreet distance, EVERYONE from the diner is following them.  Adele turns and addresses the crowd. \nADELE (to the group) You can all go home, now.  He's not going anywhere. \nLUKE Go on home, folks.  And thanks for the welcome. \nHarry comes over. \nLUKE I'll be home in a little while, Harry.  Don't wait up. \nHARRY You two have a lot of catching up to do, I guess. \nLUKE You bet. \nHARRY Goodnight, son. (tips his hat) 'Night, Delly. \nAnd the rest of the crowd disperses, variously wishing the pair goodnight.  Luke and Adele watch them disperse. \nLUKE There.  We're alone. \nThey turn and start walking. \nADELE Then why do I feel like we're still being shadowed? \nLUKE Well... where can we go? \nAdele brightens. \nADELE I know a place.  Come on! \nShe grabs his hand and they run toward the town square. \nEXT.  LAWSON CITY HALL - NIGHT \nAdele and Luke stand by the front steps. \nLUKE City hall? \nADELE You must not remember anything. Come on. \nShe grabs his hand and they run to the side of the building. \nEXT.  SIDE OF CITY HALL - NIGHT \nAdele and Luke stand by a basement window, inches off the ground.  She looks around.  Certain the coast is clear, she pounds on the window in three \"special\" places, and it pops up and open.  She looks at Luke. \nADELE You first. \nLUKE Why me? \nADELE Be a gentleman.  You have to help me down. \nAS LUKE CLIMBS IN, WE \nCUT TO: \nA LARGE, MUSLIN-COVERED OBJECT. \nSlowly, the muslin is drawn off, revealing A STATUE OF A KNEELING SOLIDER, praying before a soldier's grave.  We slowly PAN DOWN from the top of the statue... \nINT.  CITY HALL BASEMENT STORAGE ROOM - NIGHT \nADELE (O.S.) When we were kids, my Dad was mayor, and you and me and a bunch of others used to come down here all the time. \nON ADELE AND LUKE \nlooking up at the statue in this city hall basement storage room, lit only by a single shaft of moonlight from the window.  The muslin covering lay bunched at their feet. \nADELE Of course, there was a lot more room before they stuck the memorial down here. \nLUKE (looks at the door) How'd they get it inside? \nADELE Through the door.  It comes apart. \nShe moves to the memorial.  Squinting, she examines its base. \nADELE Your name's on here.  See? \nLuke comes over. \nThe cat comes around a corner and disappears through a door at the end of a hallway.  Luke, following the cat, comes around the same corner and looks at \nTHE DOOR. \nSlightly ajar, there's a light coming from within, as well as the sound of Old Tim softly humming \"It's a Long Way to Tipperary.\" \nLuke moves to the door and knocks. \nLUKE Um, Old Tim?  Sorry, it's late. It's Luke.  Can I come in? \nThe humming stops, and after a moment, the door swings open, revealing Old Tim, a pipe in his mouth, holding the cat, stroking its fur. \nOLD TIM Found me. \nLUKE Yeah.  I hope you don't mind.  I didn't know anyone lived here... well, besides Harry.  And me. \nOld Tim moves into the room and gestures for Luke to follow him. \nINT.  OLD TIM'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe room is lit by a small table lamp next to the neat cot, which is perfectly made, military-style. \nOLD TIM Not used to visitors. (gesturing) Sit. \nOld Tim points to a ragged, overstuffed easy chair next to the \"kitchen\" area -- a sink, dishes and utensils, a tiny icebox. \nLuke sits in the chair, and Old Tim sits on the cot, facing him.  Silence.  Luke glances up at a photo atop the bureau. \nON THE PHOTO \nIt's a much younger Old Tim, looking quite serious and handsome in his Great War doughboy's uniform. \nThe cat jumps down from Old Tim's arms and moves to Luke.  He rubs against his legs, purring.  Luke leans down to pet him. \nLUKE So I guess this fellow belongs to you.  What's his name? \nOLD TIM Cat. \nLUKE Cat.  That's simple.  I like it. (pets Cat) Hi, Cat. \nOLD TIM (sudden change-of-subject) We thought you was dead, you know. (another new thought) It's okay that I live here? \nLUKE Of course. \nPause, then suddenly. \nOLD TIM Do you think I'll get me a new u-u uniform? \nLuke looks up at the old man, who stammers when he speaks more than a couple of words. \nLUKE I'll do everything I can. \nOld Tim puffs on his pipe, strangely detached. \nOLD TIM T-t-thank you.  Thank you.  I... I always... I always wanted to wear my uniform from the Great War, but your daddy, he always said no, that's not an usher's u-u-uniform, that's an army uniform and the Bijou, she's not the army.  They give me a medal, but I lost it in the h-h-hospital.  I forget things sometimes.  Since the w-w-war. \nLUKE Yeah... me too. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY \nIt's a pretty typical bachelor's apartment.  The \"SAND PIRATES\" poster leans up against a chair.  Pete's two boxes of belongings from the studio are on the coffee table, the empty bottle of Jack Daniels on top. \nThere's an insistent KNOCK at the door. \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton?  You in there?  This is the Super, I have the master key and I'm coming in! \nWe HEAR the key in the lock and the door swings open, revealing the building SUPER, 50s.  Behind him is Leo Kubelsky.  They enter the room, and the Super sniffs the air. \nLEO You smell gas? \nSUPER Don't smell nothin'.  He must not be dead in here. \nLEO Jesus. \nSUPER Hey, it's the best way to tell. \nLeo moves to the boxes and rummages through them.  He picks up the empty bottle, examines it. \nSUPER You think he's drunk somewhere? \nLEO (under his breath) Wouldn't blame him if he was. \nSUPER Well, his rent's past due and he said to call you in case of an emergency.  He lose his job or somethin'? \nLEO (holding out his folding money) What's his rent? \nSUPER Thirty a month. \nLeo peels off a hundred-dollar bill. \nLEO Here's three months rent, and a ten spot for no more questions and to keep an eye on his place.  Now, I need a moment alone. \nSUPER (examining the bill) Huh? \nLEO Take a hike.  Am-scray. \nSUPER Huh?  Oh, sure.  Just pull the door shut when you leave. \nCUT TO: \nTHE SAME - LATER \nAdele and Luke are slow dancing to \"Thanks for the Memory.\" \nLUKE How do you tell those two apart, anyway? \nADELE Alex and Charlie?  Simple.  Alex is the smarter one. \nLUKE That's... pretty frightening. \nThey laugh and dance a bit more. \nADELE Your dancing's very good. \nLUKE Thanks. \nADELE It never used to be.  You were two left feet on the dance floor.  Like pulling teeth to get you to do a little box step. \nLUKE Guess I must've learned. \nLuke dances Adele away, a slightly nonplussed expression on her face.  The band finishes the song, and everyone enthusiastically APPLAUDS.  Spencer bows shyly, blushing slightly.  He nods to the band, and they bow before he motions for the crowd's attention. \nSPENCER (nervously) Thanks, folks.  Gee, can you tell we never played in front of people before? \nThe crowd yells \"No!,\" \"You guys sound great!,\" etc. \nSPENCER Well, this is our first time, and it's really all because of Luke.  I mean, it's because of Luke coming back that we're here tonight -- but I'm talking about this. \nHe holds up the clarinet and scans the crowd until he sees Luke. \nSPENCER (to Luke) When you didn't come back, I learned how to play this so I could remember you.  And now that you're back, well, I'll never forget you. (to the crowd) Luke gave me this clarinet, but he gave this night to all of us. \nThe crowd APPLAUDS warmly. \nSPENCER Okay folks, here's Mayor Cole! \nThe crowd APPLAUDS as Ernie Cole mounts the band riser.  He turns and addresses Avery Wyatt, on drums. \nERNIE Pretty proud of your boy, Avery? \nAvery smiles broadly and beats the KICK DRUM five or six times to register his reaction. \nON THE KICK DRUM -- \"WYATT'S HARDWARE, LAWSON, CALIF.\" \nERNIE Looks like you might have to find someone else to mix paint at the store, 'cause I think Spencer's got a big career ahead of him. \nAPPLAUSE again, and Ernie waits for it to settle.  As soon as he starts speaking, the crowd becomes totally silent. \nERNIE You know folks, here in Lawson, we gave a lot for our country.  A lot. And we never complained and we never faltered.  And we never forgot. \nErnie's voice cracks slightly with emotion.  He clears his throat and continues. \nERNIE We never forgot.  And so when one of our own came back to us, I gotta tell you folks, it was like a miracle.  Luke, seein' you walking down the street, it was... well, it was kinda like seein' one of my boys alive again.  I think I speak for everyone here when I say that not a day goes by when we don't keep our boys' memories alive.  But Luke, having you back among us... well, it helps us keep their spirits alive, too.  God bless you, son. \nThe crowd APPLAUDS.  Adele takes Luke's hand and smiles. Ernie wipes his eyes and changes the subject. \nERNIE All right, enough a'that.  This is a celebration, so let's have us a good time -- but not too good a time, 'cause I see just about every member of the city council here tonight, and we have an eight a.m. council meeting tomorrow morning, and I expect y'all to be there! All right, take it away, Spencer! \nAnd Spencer kicks the band into the next tune as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE SAME - LATER \nLuke and Adele come over to Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger, standing at the periphery.  Old Tim stands a few feet back. \nLUKE Why don't you two get out there and dance? \nHARRY Oh, no, I... \nMrs. Terwilliger blushes. \nMRS. TERWILLIGER I haven't danced with another man since Mr. Terwilliger passed. \nLUKE When was that? \nMRS. TERWILLIGER Nineteen-oh-nine. \nHarry touches Luke's arm. \nHARRY Son, we're gonna go.  You two kids have a lovely time. \nGoodnights are exchanged, and the trio leaves.  Alex McKenna comes up to Adele and taps her on the shoulder. \nALEX Delly, can I have a dance? \nADELE Sure. \nAlex leads her to the dance floor as Adele shoots Luke a little \"help me!\" look.  Luke smiles back and watches the dancing crowd.  After a moment, a man in a white suit and bow tie, ROSCOE FITTS, 40s, comes over to Luke and extends his hand. \nFITTS Luke, you probably don't remember me, Roscoe Fitts, I'm the grocer here in town. \nLUKE (shakes his hand) Good to meet you.  Again. \nFITTS Like Ernie said, we're all glad to have you back. \nLUKE Thanks. \nLuke is on the roof of the theater, pliers in hand and tool box nearby.  He's just straightened out the \"J\" and he steps back... carefully... to admire his handiwork.  For the first time in a long time, the sign actually reads, \"THE BIJOU.\" \nBut not for long.  Luke tenses... the building starts shaking... and the train passes by behind the theater.  Luke lunges out of the way as three letters shake lose and fall. Once again, the sign reads, \" HE B J U.\"  Luke winces. \nEXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY \nErnie Cole and Avery Wyatt stand solemnly at the front of a small group gazing at the base of the war memorial, as it takes shape in a prominent place in the square... \nINT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY \nHarry is on a ladder, attaching the final spring stretcher to a corner of the muslin.  It snaps into place, and voila -- new screen!  Luke, Adele, Doc Lardner, and Sheriff Eldridge, standing below, applaud enthusiastically. \nINT.  ORCHESTRA PIT - DAY \nAs work progresses all around her, Mrs. Terwilliger has just finished dusting off the piano.  She opens the keyboard cover and trails her hand delicately over the keys.  She sits, closes her eyes, and begins to play -- Chopin's Op. 10 Etude No. 3 -- delicate, flowing music.  Even though the piano is a bit out of tune, it's still beautiful. \nAs she plays, all the work slowly comes to a halt.  Before long, all eyes are on her.  Everyone's listening. Transported. \nAfter a moment, she stops.  Overcome.  Everyone applauds. Surprised, Mrs. Terwilliger stands, and, blushing, bows. \nLUKE That was beautiful. \nMRS. TERWILLIGER I taught you that. \nLUKE I can play the piano? \nMRS. TERWILLIGER (all fluttery) Oh dear, yes.  You were an excellent student, before all that clarinet nonsense.  You loved Chopin.  You used to call it \"heaven music.\"  \"Teach me some heaven music,\" you used to say. \nShe sits at the piano. \nMRS. TERWILLIGER Sit.  Play with me. \nLUKE No, I... \nMRS. TERWILLIGER Some of it might come back to you. \nReluctantly, Luke sits down to her left.  As she begins to play a Chopin waltz, she encourages him to keep the 3/4 time. \nMRS. TERWILLIGER That's good... that's good... \nBut it's clear Luke has no idea what he's doing.  He's just plunking bass notes.  But after a moment, the bass figures he's improvising start to change -- and before long, it's transformed into the eight-to-the-bar figure of a boogie woogie beat.  Mrs. Terwilliger stops playing, annoyed. \nMRS. TERWILLIGER Really, Luke!  That's no way to treat Mr. Chopin! \nShe stands and moves away.  Luke keeps playing, grinning madly -- he's loving it!  After a moment, Spencer Wyatt runs over and takes Mrs. Terwilliger's place, improvising the top half to Luke's bass line. \nOLD TIM \nis tapping his foot to the beat.  He turns to Adele and says: \nOLD TIM I taught him that. \nOff Adele cracking up. \nTHE MONTAGE CONTINUES... \nEXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY \nLuke and all the letters up again.  He steps back, checks his watch, and like clockwork, the rumbling begins and a train goes by.  This time, however, only the \"J\" tips over at a jaunty angle.  Luke smiles. \nINT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY \nLuke, Adele and Harry, wearing coveralls, sit at the counter, devouring hefty plates of turkey with dressing and mashed potatoes and gravy.  Luke's and Adele's hair is practically white from plaster dust and Harry's face and hands are stained with paint specks. \nAt the other side of the counter, Mabel is chatting amiably with Bob Leffert.  She smiles at him warmly, then turns to refill Harry's coffee cup.  Harry thanks her, then turns back to the newspaper he's reading. \nINSERT - THE FRONT PAGE OF THE LAWSON JOURNAL-AMERICAN \nProminent is the black-and-white photo of a little boy and a policeman holding up Pete's jacket, with the accompanying headline: \nBOY, 5, FINDS SUSPECTED RED'S JACKET ON SANTA BARBARA BEACH Hollywood Writer Feared Dead Were Red Agents Involved? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - NIGHT \nLuke's standing near the sign.  He yells to Adele, down below on the ground.  She, in turn, yells to Harry, standing near a switch panel behind the candy counter.  He throws the switch... \n... and the sign lights up beautifully!  Then, they all feel the rumble -- the train rolls past, and, although they rattle and shake, no letters fall.  A CHEER goes up from Adele, Harry, and the small crowd of ONLOOKERS below.  Delighted, Luke takes a formal bow.  The boogie-woogie ends as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY \nON THE MEMORIAL \nComplete and polished, standing proudly in the center of the square. \nWIDER \nIt's a clear, balmy day, and the whole town is turned out. Mayor Ernie Cole is at the podium.  He finishes his remarks, then picks up the two faded gold stars representing the lost lives of his sons.  He holds them up, high above his head. \nON THE CROWD \nOne-by-one, the gold stars of the town's boys are solemnly held aloft by their loved ones. \nLuke and Harry stand at the side of the square, looking out at the sea of four or five dozen gold stars being held aloft. Luke catches a glimpse of a man in an army uniform... \nLUKE'S POV \nLuke looks at Harry's face for a moment.  Then as the tears well up, he leans over and ever-so-gently places a kiss on Harry's forehead. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  LAWSON CEMETERY - DAY \nIt's a beautiful, bright, sunny day.  Luke and Adele stand at the front of the large group of mourners.  REVEREND COLEMAN, 50s, conducts the service. \nCOLEMAN We commit to the earth the mortal remains of Harry Bernard Trumbo, safe in the knowledge that his immortal soul is at peace and at last reunited with his beloved Lillian in the bosom of the Lord. Let us pray. \nEveryone bows their heads. \nCOLEMAN \"The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures...\" \nLuke looks up at the sky, then steps forward and lays a single rose on Harry's casket.  Then, as everyone surreptitiously watches, he turns and walks away from the gravesite, toward the cemetery entrance. \nAdele watches Luke depart... \nANOTHER ANGLE \n... and she's not alone.  Agents Saunders and Brett are watching everything from their car, which is parked nearby. As Luke walks away, Saunders snaps his photo with a long-lens camera... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nTHE BASE OF THE WAR MEMORIAL, \nand Luke's name inscribed there. \nEXT.  CITY HALL SQUARE - DUSK \nLuke stands in front of the memorial, head bowed.  After a moment, he sits, leaning against the memorial. \nON LUKE \nLost in thought, he buries his face in his hands. \nADELE'S VOICE (O.S.) Mind if I join you? \nLuke looks up, squinting.  Adele stands above him, backlit by the golden light of the sundown. \nLUKE Sure. \nShe sits next to him.  Tentatively, she touches his shoulder. He leans into her, and she enfolds her arm in his. \nPause. \nLUKE Your father said... that I would start to remember things. \nSuddenly, Adele feels as though she's walking on eggshells. \nADELE (slowly) What... do you remember? \nLUKE Well... everything.  It started coming back a couple of days ago. I remember everything now. \nADELE I see... \nLUKE Delly.  I'm... I'm not... Harry wasn't my father.  And I'm not... I'm not Luke. \nShe closes her eyes.  All her suspicions are suddenly confirmed. \nADELE (adrift) Oh... \nHer tears start, and she moves to hug Luke -- but instead, she starts hitting him, flailing, beating on his chest.  He hugs her tightly, and she completely lets go. \nADELE (crying) Oh, god, I knew!  I knew!  I knew from the start!  I wanted you to be Luke!  I wanted you to be alive! You're so much like him, you have no idea.  No wonder everyone else accepted you!  You don't know what you -- what Luke meant to this town, suddenly being alive!  You don't know what this town lost! You just don't know... \nShe pulls away, stands, and looks him in the eye.  Luke rises. \nADELE (sobbing uncontrollably) I knew you weren't Luke!  And I tried not to fall in love with you! And... I don't even know your name! Oh, god... \nLuke moves toward her.  She backs away. \nLUKE I fell in love with you, too, Delly.  Only now I don't know how I feel, about you or about anything. I only think I know how Luke would feel. \nShe's still sobbing.  He moves to her, takes her in his arms. \nLUKE Delly, shhhhhh... \nADELE (pulling away) No... I can't... I have to... I can't... \nShe runs off, crying... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY \nON SHERIFF ELDRIDGE, \nmaking short work of a steak and eggs.  As he powers down his meal, Agents Saunders and Brett, distinctly out-of-place in their dark suits and hats, enter the diner.  They take note of Eldridge, and come over. \nSAUNDERS Are you the sheriff? \nELDRIDGE And I got the uniform to prove it. \nSAUNDERS I'm Special Agent Walter Saunders, this is Special Agent Steven Brett, FBI.  May we have a word with you? \nThey flash identification, which Eldridge notes. \nELDRIDGE (gesturing) Please, sit. \nAfter a moment, he HEARS footsteps coming up the ladder to the roof. \nPETE Who's that? \nADELE'S VOICE It's me. \nAdele climbs onto the roof, comes over and sits down next to Pete. \nADELE Hi. \nPETE Hi. \nPause. \nADELE I'm sure a lot of people down in L.A. are worried sick about you. \nPETE Yeah?  I'm sure a lot more people down in L.A. want a piece of me. \nHe turns to her. \nPETE This Luke was a pretty good guy, wasn't he? \nADELE (wistful smile) Oh, yes.  Yes, he was. \nPETE Well... let me tell you, I'm not Luke.  I know who I am now, and you don't.  And... I don't like me very much. \nADELE (changing the subject) You know, it's going to take me a while to get used to calling you Pete. (she takes it for a spin) Pete.  Pete.  It's a nice name. \nPETE Thanks, I like it.  I think. \nPause. \nPETE Delly, I want to do the right thing. \nPete can't believe he just said that -- but he did. \nADELE I believe you. \nPETE The truth is, I'm a lot of things, but communist isn't one of them. \nADELE But if you only went to one meeting, why does anyone care? Besides, why should it even matter if you were a communist? \nPETE Come on, Delly, look at the country today.  We're fighting communists in Korea, we're paranoid about the Russians, we've got this thing with the Rosenbergs and the atomic bomb... (bitterly) You think they want \"suspected communists\" entertaining the American public with party propaganda like, gosh I don't know, \"Sand Pirates of the Sahara?\" \nADELE Forget about all that.  You want to do the right thing?  Then defend your name.  If someone says something about you that's untrue, you have to stand up and say so.  I know the law, and the law's on your side. \nBeat. \nPETE What about you, Delly? \nADELE I am, too. \nPete smiles and puts his arms around her. \nPETE You'll stand by me? \nADELE Whatever happens. \nThey kiss, and we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  RORY'S GAS STATION - MORNING \nThere's a thick bank of coastal fog just down the road, obscuring any view of the ocean a mile away.  It's deadly quiet as gas station owner RORY, late 60s, pulls up and parks his Model A truck.  He gets out, and an big old German Shepherd, LOTTIE, jumps out of the truck bed. \nRory moves to the door, and is about to put his key in the lock, when Lottie starts whining, looking toward the fog bank and sniffing the air expectantly. \nRORY Whatsit, girl? \nHe stops -- he hears something, too -- a LOW RUMBLE.  Lottie starts BARKING.  The RUMBLE is getting LOUDER.  Rory's getting worried.  He looks at \nTHE FOG BANK. \nIt's starting to GLOW from within.  Lottie's barking gets LOUDER and angrier.  Suddenly, a large black car punches out of the fog bank and tears down the road.  It's followed by another, and another -- and perhaps a dozen more cars and trucks, all heading hell-bent-for-leather toward the town. \nRory moves toward Lottie, trying to quiet her as the cars fly past the station. \nRORY Shhhhh.  I know, Lottie.  This time, I thought it was the Martians for sure. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  COMMERCE STREET - DAY \nThe place is bedlam, overflowing with REPORTERS, NEWSREEL CAMERA CREWS, PHOTOGRAPHERS, you name it. \nA RADIO CREW is broadcasting in front of Mabel's Diner.  The REPORTER is on-the-air, hugging his microphone, speaking above the din.  Mabel stands next to him, his hand on her shoulder.  Bob Leffert stands nearby, grim. \nREPORTER I'm here with Mabel Lanier, the owner of the diner here on Commerce Street where Appleton often took meals.  Mrs. Lanier, tell me, what are your thoughts about having such a celebrated suspected communist in your midst all this time? \nMABEL Well, its kinds hard to believe, 'cause Luke -- I mean Peter -- is such a... I mean, since he's been back, I've never seen the town so happy and all.  It's like he gave us some... I don't know... some hope, I guess. \nREPORTER What she's referring to folks, is yet another bizarre twist in this story.  Not only is Appleton alive, but he's been suffering from amnesia and living here in Lawson, where, due to a startling resemblance, everyone in town for the last three months has taken him for one of Lawson's dead war heroes, Albert Trumbo... \nMABEL (a catch in her voice) Luke.  We always called him Luke. \nMabel glances at Bob, who lowers his head. \nCUT TO: \nOLD TIM They'll come back, you know. They'll all c-c-come back. \nPETE The customers?  I don't know... \nOLD TIM They will.  They w-w-will. \nPete turns to Old Tim, fixes him in the eye. \nPETE Tim, I have to tell you something. \nOLD TIM Oh. \nPETE It's about me. \nOLD TIM Oh. \nPause, as Pete gathers courage and tries to find the words. \nPETE I'm... I'm not Luke.  Luke is dead. He died in the war.  He's not coming back, and I'm not him.  I don't even belong here.  This whole thing started out as an accident, and that's all it is.  An accident. \nOLD TIM Oh... \nPETE My name isn't Luke.  It's Peter. Peter Appleton. \nOld Tim stands and looks askance at Pete. \nPause. \nOLD TIM Did you think I didn't kn-kn-know that? \nPETE (taken aback) I thought you... \nOLD TIM I know more than you give me c-c- credit, that's for sure.  Don't you see, it don't m-m-matter who you are?  All that matters is what you g-g-gave us.  And you can't take that away now.  You're wrong, Peter Appleton.  You do belong here. \nHe leans down to Pete. \nOLD TIM You hafta give us back the B-B- Bijou. \nOld Tim straightens up, nods at Pete.  Then, silently, he picks up Cat and exits. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - DAY \nPete and Adele walk slowly down the platform toward the waiting train. \nADELE You've got everything? \nPETE Yeah.  Except a chance in hell of coming out of this intact. \nADELE You'll be fine.  No matter what Leo Kubelsky says, you've got a hundred and seventy-five years of American law on your side.  Don't forget that. \nPETE I wish you were coming with me. \nADELE And who's gonna run the projector until you get back?  Mrs. Terwilliger? \nPETE Maybe we could train Cat to run the projector.  You know, a system of scratching posts, and gears, and levers... \nThey both smile as the train's HORN blows. \nCONDUCTOR Board! \nPete picks up his suitcase and they walk toward the passenger compartment. \nADELE Did you bring along something to read? \nPETE Damn... \nAdele pulls a pocket-sized leather-bound book out of her purse and hands it to Pete. \nADELE I didn't think so.  Here.  This is mine, you can borrow it. \nINSERT - THE BOOK \nWell-worn and scuffed, nevertheless the title is clear: \nCONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES ANNOTATED EDITION \nPete looks at the book, then at Adele. \nADELE Not exactly light reading, I know. Believe it or not, I've read this since high school, and it got me all the way through law school. Besides, there's something in there that'll help you.  You won't have to get very far, it's near the beginning. \nPETE (clearly touched) Delly... thanks, thank you.  I'll take good care of this. \nADELE Just remember two things.  First, the law is a living thing.  It made us free and it keeps us free. Sometimes it gets twisted around by people for their own purposes. Sometimes it makes mistakes, sometimes big mistakes.  But in the end, the law prevails for the just. Sometimes, it takes a while. \nPETE Okay.  What's the second thing? \nShe thinks for a moment.  She needs the right words. \nADELE I'll be here... if you come back. \nThe train pulls out.  Adele and Pete exchange waves as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM (LOS ANGELES) - DAY \nThe House Committee on Un-American Activities has effectively taken over the Grand Ballroom of this magnificent hotel, and the joint is packed to the rafters.  Members of the AUDIENCE crane their necks to see out into the hallway, from where the witnesses will be entering. \nA few spectators titter. \nINT.  MABEL'S DINER - DAY \nMabel and Bob listen to the hearing on a radio in the packed diner. \nCLYDE (ON RADIO) Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called \"The Bijou,\" is that also true? \nPETE (ON RADIO) Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there. \nINT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY \nClyde holds up copies of the Los Angeles Examiner and Los Angeles Times with Pete's picture on the front page. \nCLYDE Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... \"accident,\" Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this \"accident\" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory? \nPETE Yes. \nCLYDE And what is the state of your memory now? \nBeat.  Pete smiles. \nPETE I'm sorry, what was the question? \nThe audience LAUGHS.  Clyde nods at Pete, forces a tight smile. \nCLYDE We... appreciate... your little note of levity, Mr. Appleton, but this is a very serious matter, and it merits your fullest attention. (back to business) That state of your memory now, Mr. Appleton? \nINT.  WYATT'S HARDWARE - DAY \nAvery Wyatt listens to the hearing on a store radio.  Spencer comes around the paint aisle, wiping his hands on his apron. He moves to the radio and listens solemnly. \nPETE (ON RADIO) Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory? \nINT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY \nCLYDE (impatient) I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently \"blotted out\" as a result of your \"accident.\" \nPETE (smiling) Mr. Clyde, I remember everything. \nCLYDE Good.  Good. (holds up a piece of paper) Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the \"Bread Instead of Bullets Club\" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it? \nPete looks on the table and finds the roster.  He's surprised to see it. \nPETE Yes... yes, I do. \nCLYDE Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there? \nPETE Yes it does. \nCLYDE Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the \"Bread Instead of Bullets Club?\" \nPETE Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things? \nCLYDE Start with what you knew then. \nPETE Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there. \nCLYDE We see it.  For the record, it reads \"Lucille Angstrom.\"  What's the point of this? \nPETE Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her. \nCLYDE (grinning) Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl? \nPETE (slyly) Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom... \nThe audience LAUGHS.  Doyle BANGS his gavel. \nPETE You asked for the truth.  That's the truth.  I had no idea what the meeting was about.  I just sat through it so I could be near her. I'm sure even a Majority Counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl. \nThe audience LAUGHS.  Clyde shoots a look at Doyle, who BANGS his gavel. \nDOYLE Chamber will come to order. \nClyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete. \nCLYDE All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now? \nPETE (takes a deep breath) Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for? \nCLYDE Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive... \nA few members of the audience APPLAUD.  As Pete speaks, their numbers grow. \nPETE (passionately) I know that a lot of good, honest, decent people, people that I consider my true friends, feel betrayed by me, not because of who and what I am, but because of what you say I am!  I know that I... \nDoyle BANGS his gavel several times.  Pete stops and the room falls quiet. \nDOYLE (emphatically) Mr. Appleton, you will respond to the questions of this committee without elaboration or speechmaking, or the chair will find you in Contempt Of Congress. You will not be warned again, is that clear? (he lets this sink in, then) Continue, Mr. Clyde. \nCLYDE (looking down at his desk) Mr. Appleton... \nClyde takes a long pause for effect, then looks up at Pete. \nCLYDE Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party? \nPETE No, sir. \nCLYDE (holding up the roster) Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony? \nPETE \nHe looks up at Chairman Doyle.  Now fully confident. \nPETE That's the First Amendment, Mr. Chairman.  It's the backbone of this nation.  It's everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just -- if only we'd live up to that potential.  It's what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear.  It's the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country.  And even though this contract... (he holds up the book) ... the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- even though they're just pieces of paper with signatures on them -- they're the only contracts we have that are most definitely not subject to renegotiation.  Not by you, Mr. Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde, not by any member of this committee -- or anyone else -- ever. \nPin-drop silence in the room.  Pete scans the faces of the panel.  All betray anger. \nON LEO \nHe can't help but smile and nod appreciatively. \nPETE And when you get right down to it, that's really all I have to say to this committee.  Good morning. \nAnd with that, Pete closes the book, picks up the prepared statement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands and walks toward the door.  The cameras swing with him, and FLASHBULBS fire like machine guns.  Doyle BANGS his gavel insistently. \nDOYLE The witness will resume his seat! Did you hear me?!  You are not excused, Mr. Appleton! \nAnd then, slowly, APPLAUSE builds in the chamber, reaching a crescendo as Pete reaches the door and exits. \nCLYDE Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman...! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - DAY \nAs Pete exits the hotel, a DOZEN REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS have him completely surrounded.  FLASHBULBS pop.  He's taken aback, flustered. \nFIRST REPORTER (seeing Pete) There he is! \nSECOND REPORTER Pete!  Are you going back to writing pictures? \nPETE I don't know... \nTHIRD REPORTER You a commie, Pete? \nPETE No, of course not... \nSECOND REPORTER What about the girl, Pete?  You gonna marry her?  Is she coming to Hollywood, or are you... \nPETE Look, fellas, I don't have anything to say... \nPete is trapped in the crowd, when he feels a hand on his shoulder. \nLEO \nspins him around, and pushes him through the crowd toward the curb. \nLEO Come on, kid. \nAt the curb is a black Cadillac limousine.  Leo hauls open the back door and pushes Pete in, before climbing in himself. \nThe limo drives away, as the reporters give chase. \nINT.  LIMO (MOVING) - DAY \nLeo and Pete sit side-by-side in silence for a moment.  Leo breaks it. \nLEO That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets. \nPETE I'm not sorry for what I said. \nLEO No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble. \nThey sit in silence again for a moment until Leo reaches into his pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case, which he opens and offers to Pete. \nLEO Cigarette? \nPETE No thanks. \nLeo takes one for himself and lights up.  Pete takes off his hat and nervously scratches his head. \nLEO When'd you quit smoking? \nPETE Luke didn't smoke. \nLEO Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer. \nPETE (laughs) Not any more. \nLEO Why not? \nPETE Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail. \nLEO (with a smile) Not at all. \nPETE Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore. \nLEO (snickering) What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter? \nBut before Pete can answer... \nLEO Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning. \nPETE What do you mean? \nLEO Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do. \nPETE Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that. \n", "test1_input": "A TV SCREEN \nIt's tiny, with rounded corners, black-and-white, and a hopeless chaos of horizontal bars and snow. \nWIDER \nINT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nDoc Lardner is fiddling with a brand-new console television set, trying vainly to tune in a clear picture of \"Your Show of Shows.\"  He adjusts the dials, fiddles with the rabbit ears, steps back -- and is successful.  SID CAESAR And IMOGENE COCA are involved in an elaborate pantomime sketch, and Lardner fairly roars with laughter. \nHe turns to go back to his chair, but the second he does so, the reception goes haywire.  He returns to the spot in front of the TV, and the picture is perfect again. \nThe DOORBELL RINGS.  He's torn -- if he moves, the picture will break up.  The doorbell RINGS again, and we HEAR Adele's voice from upstairs: \nADELE (O.S.) Daddy, that's Luke, can you let him in?  I'll be right down. \nLARDNER Honey, I... I can't... it's the... \nThere's a KNOCK at the door. \nLARDNER (giving in) Oh, hell... \nHe moves from his spot.  The reception goes bad, and he marches to the door. \nHe opens it, and Luke is standing there, wearing a slightly out-of-date coat and tie. \nLARDNER Evening, Luke. \nLUKE Evening, Doctor Lardner. \nLardner freezes, staring at Luke. \nLUKE What's wrong? \nLARDNER (shaken from his reverie) Uh, no... just seeing you standing there, it reminded me... there's a word for it... \nLUKE Oh, you mean the suit.  Harry kept all my old clothes.  Fits okay, but it's a little big. \nAdele comes down the stairs.  Halfway down, she stops suddenly and stares at Luke. \nADELE Oh... \nAwkward pause.  Adele's staring at Luke, Lardner's staring at Luke, and Luke's getting nervous. \nLUKE I shouldn't have worn the suit. \nAdele comes down the stairs. \nADELE No... you were wearing that suit the last time we went out before... \nLUKE Oh... \nADELE ... and It's just... well, deja vu. \nLARDNER That's it.  Deja vu. \nAnother awkward pause as Adele and Luke stare at each other. Lardner breaks it. \nLARDNER You kids off to the dance? \nLUKE Aren't you coming? \nLARDNER No, I'm not much of a dancer. \nADELE (chidingly) Besides, Daddy's still trying to figure out how to get his new television set working. \nLARDNER I had it, a minute ago... \nHe glances at the TV set.  The picture is suddenly crystal clear. \nLARDNER ... ooooh, It's back. (encouraging them toward the door) Well, you kids have fun now... \nAdele takes Luke's arm and they exit, exchanging goodnights with Lardner, who closes the door and turns toward the living room. \nS-l-o-w-l-y, he sneaks into the room, watching the TV carefully all the while.  The reception is staying perfect. Caesar and Coca are involved in an intricate bit of business, and Lardner wants to laugh, but he's afraid to.  He stifles his urge, and heads for his chair.  Gingerly, he sits.  Still perfect. \nSatisfied, he finally LAUGHS out loud and puts his feet up. The picture goes completely haywire again. \nLARDNER Aw, crap. \nEXT.  STREET - NIGHT \nAdele and Luke walk along, arm-in-arm. \nADELE This is strange.  Do you feel it? \nLUKE What? \nADELE We've done this before, so many times.  The last time was so long ago, but it feels like yesterday. \nLUKE Oh. \nPause. \nADELE You know, everyone's so excited about the Bijou re-opening... \nLUKE (interrupting) It's gonna cost over nine hundred dollars to open the place, Delly. \nADELE (shocked) Nine hundred... \n", "test1_true": "ADELE What about a loan?  You could go to the bank...? \nLUKE A loan to a man who ran his business into the ground and his son who can't account for the last nine-and-a-half years of his life? Not likely. \nADELE Well, there's got to be a way... \nLUKE (suddenly) Have you got a cigarette? \nAdele stops. \nADELE When did you start smoking? \nLUKE I don't smoke? \nADELE You tried to once.

CITY HALL SQUARE - DAY \nSpencer Wyatt's big ban is comprised of a dozen or so MUSICIANS about Spencer's age -- except for the drummer, AVERY WYATT, 40s, Spencer's dad.  Though no Gene Krupa, he pounds the skins pretty well, all the while smiling proudly as his son plays clarinet and leads the band. \nDespite the last minute decorations, the Square looks nice, hung with multicolored paper lanterns and colored lights. \nON LUKE AND ADELE \ndancing to the music, along with several other COUPLES. \nLUKE (nodding toward the band) They're not bad. \nADELE No, they're not.  I'd say your investment was paying dividends. \nLUKE My what? \nADELE Back in '37, you heard Benny Goodman play for the first time, so you went out and got a used clarinet.  You wanted nothing more than to be able to play like him. You tried hard, but it wasn't long before it was clear that Benny Goodman would never be looking over his shoulder.  So you gave the clarinet to Spencer. \nLUKE Huh.  That was nice of me. \nADELE You had a hidden agenda, though. See, when he was five or six, little Spence used to follow you around like a puppy.  Bothered the hell out of you.  But as soon as you gave him the clarinet... \nLUKE ... he started practicing, and he left me alone from then on. \nADELE Exactly.  And he got good. \nLUKE No kidding. \nThey dance a bit. \nADELE Now, did you remember that, or... \nLUKE Nope.  Just filling in the blanks. \nADELE Oh.  Okay. \nAnd as they dance away, we \nCUT TO: \nTHE SAME - LATER \nON THE REFRESHMENTS TABLE \nLuke is pouring two glasses of punch, while Adele is being shyly admired (and having her ear bent) by two twin brothers, ALEX and CHARLIE MCKENNA, mid-20s. \nALEX You're the luckiest guy in town, Luke.

Stroking Cat, Old Tim stares at the poignant scene unfolding on the screen, pausing only to wipe his eyes and nose with a handkerchief.  He doesn't notice \nLUKE \nwho looks up towards the projection booth. \nCUT TO: \nA BRIGHT, WHITE, FLICKERING LIGHT, \nfilling the frame.  We're looking directly into the beam of light radiating from the projector. \nPUSHING INTO THE LIGHT, we get closer to the windows of the booth.  We come out of the beam and can just barely make out the figure of Harry, framed in a small window next to the projector. \nWE CONTINUE PUSHING IN -- closer and closer -- until Harry's face fills the screen.  He is watching the film; his eyes are wide and moist, as though he's experiencing the magic that's unfolding on the screen for the very first time. \nThe warning bell on the projector CHIMES THREE TIMES, signaling the end of the reel.  Harry moves away from the window. \nINT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT \nNever taking his eyes off the screen, Harry watches as the film comes to an end and flap!  falp!  falps!  out of the projector.  He kills the motor and cranks the carbon arcs apart, and the bright beam dies.  It's not the end of the movie, but it is the end of the only fragment they have. \nHarry moves to the house lights rheostat, and slowly fades them up.  This done, he pulls a handkerchief from his back pocket and blows his nose loudly. \nHe crosses back to the projector, unlatches the full take-up reel and takes it down.  He's about to move away, when he senses that he's not alone.  He looks over the projector to see \nLUKE, \nstanding there.  Their eyes meet.  Someone should say something -- both men search for words.  Suddenly, Luke feels very out-of-place, almost embarrassed -- as though he's interrupted a very private ritual. \nHarry senses this.  Clutching the precious reel of film tightly to his chest, he searches Luke's face and smiles warmly. \nHARRY Beautiful, wasn't it? \nLUKE (softly) Yes. \nHARRY Well, son, I wish I could've shown you more, but this is all that's left.  Just this one reel that never got sent back from a picture we showed here a long time ago. Nineteen twenty-five, to be exact... \nLUKE Dad, I... \nHARRY (a tiny laugh) Ha! \nLUKE ... what? \nHARRY You know, since you've been back, that's the first time you've called me \"Dad.\" \nFather and son look at each other for a long moment -- searching each other's eyes.  Harry smiles a sort-of half- smile at Luke, and, still clutching the reel, crosses to the rewind bench.  Methodically, he mounts it and threads the end of the film onto an empty reel.  Slowly, he begins to turn the crank, rewinding the film. \nHe stops and looks to where Luke was standing... but he's not there. \nANGLE - PROJECTION BOOTH DOOR \nLuke is leaning up against the wall just outside of the projection booth. \nONE LUKE \nAs he closes his eyes... \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nON HARRY \nIn bed, sound asleep, snoring.

VERA DWIGHT, the council secretary, a cherubic woman in her 40s, is reading the minutes of the last meeting. \nVERA Finally, Roscoe Fitts moved, and Red Curtis seconded, that the council form a committee to investigate the adoption of a new property taxation structure. Motion carried, nine to two, one abstention. \nAs Vera speaks, the meeting room door opens and Luke, Harry, Old Time and Mrs. Terwilliger slip inside and take seats on the unoccupied benches. \nERNIE Thanks, Vera. \nErnie notices Luke and the trio. \nERNIE Well, the chair notes the presence this morning of Luke and Harry Trumbo and the rest of the Bijou staff.  Frankly, the chair notes the presence of just about anyone who ever finds their way into one of these meetings.

Hearing no opposition, the motion is carried. \nPause.  Ernie turns to Luke and smiles. \nERNIE Go ahead, son. \nLUKE Thanks.  Well, I'll make this short and sweet.  The Bijou needs a lot of repairs, and the truth of the matter is, Harry, um, that is, Dad and me, Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim, we can't possible afford them all.  So, I'd like to ask your help to... well, to scrounge around a bit, and see if you have anything that might help us out. \nWYATT What kinds of things are you talking about? \nLUKE Oh, paint, brushes, plaster, light bulbs, yardage, and if you can't come up with any of that, we can use some old-fashioned elbow grease. \nFitts leans forward. \nFITTS So... you do intend to fix the place up after all? \nLUKE Mr. Fitts, with all due respect, I think Lawson needs the Bijou a bit more than it needs a super market. And I think Lawson deserves the Bijou.  There's not a lot that can be done to help us get past the pain we've all felt... \nHe looks at Harry and smiles. \nLUKE ... but I think a good dose of magic is as good a place as any to start. \nThe council members MURMUR amongst themselves, then: \nWYATT (eagerly) Motion to encourage the citizenry of Lawson to help out the Bijou in any way they can... \nDALEY (a subtle reminder) ... short of the allocation of city funds... \nWYATT (agreeing) ... short of allocation of city funds. \nDALEY (enthusiastically) Seconded! \nERNIE (brightly) Motion on the floor, discussion open, discussion closed, all those in favor signify by saying \"aye.\" \nALL AYE! \nERNIE Hearing no opposition, the motion is carried!

Harry steps forward and gathers some of it in his arms. \nErnie and Daley step forward and look up at the monument. \nErnie touches the names of his two sones inscribed on the base of the monument. \nERNIE (slowly) You know, this really ought to be out where people can see it. \nLuke overhears this last, and as he smiles, he turns to Harry, who brightens as he pulls a large section of the muslin taut between his outstretched arms... \nCUT TO: \nMONTAGE - WITH SOME HARD-DRIVING BOOGIE-WOOGIE UNDER... \nANGLE - THE SCREEN \nHarry's on a ladder, snipping the cords holding up the old screen, which is dropping, bit-by-bit, into the arms of Luke and Adele, who are surrounded by a group of LITTLE KIDS, watching the goings-on in wide-eyed awe. \nHarry snips the last line, and the rest of the old screen drops down on Luke's head.  Suddenly... LUKE'S A GHOST!!  He raises his arms and plays the bogeyman for the kids, who scream in mock terror and scatter, as Harry and Adele laugh. \nINT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY \nOld Tim and Harry carry a dilapidated row of seats up the aisle, as Adele and Mabel move in, tearing up the rotten carpeting and sweeping up the dust and debris. \nThe men are having a tough time carrying the seats, and just as they're about to drop the row, someone rushes in next to Harry and grabs his end.  It's Carl Leffert.  A second later, someone else grabs Old Tim's end. \nBOB LEFFERT \nhas a good purchase on the seats with his good hand and his hook.  He nods to Old Tim, who steps away, mopping his brow. \nLuke smiles as he sees this from the front of the auditorium. \nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY \nHarry, Stanton and Mrs. Terwilliger, with the help of Avery Wyatt and his son Spencer, tear down the rotting draperies and scrape off the wallpaper covering the lobby walls.  Then, as Harry, Spencer and Stanton sand down the walls, Avery and Mrs. Terwilliger hand them freshly-mixed cans of red wall paint and brushes.  Immediately, they all set to work painting. \nEXT.  THE BIJOU SIGN - DAY \n", "test2_id": 2350, "test3_input": "As Luke passes the auditorium doors, a MAN comes out of the theater and crosses to the candy counter.  The door stays open for a moment, and Luke decides to duck inside and catch a bit of the picture. \nINT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT \nON THE SCREEN - \"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA\" \nThe second-to-last reel of a black-and-white early-50's programmer.  It's nighttime in the desert.  A huge full moon hangs over a B-movie soundstage version of the pyramids. GREGORY, a dark, handsome leading man in a pith helmet is engaged in a fierce swordfight with KHALID, the villain. \nPete takes a seat on the aisle near the door. \nGREGORY (ONSCREEN) You don't think you can win this, do you? \nKhalid lunges and draws Gregory's blood. \nLUKE (ala \"Khalid\") \"Ha!  I'd say I was winning!\" \nKHALID (ONSCREEN) Ha!  I'd say I was winning! \nLuke's look is \"How did I know he was gonna say that?\" \nOnscreen, an EVIL HENCHMAN is sneaking up behind Gregory. \nLUKE \"Gregory!  Look out!\" \nWOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN) Gregory!  Look out! \nPete did it again. \nOnscreen, Gregory turns and kills the Henchman, then quickly dispatches Khalid.  He stands over the body, catches his breath and says: \nGREGORY (ONSCREEN) It's all right, Rebecca. \nWOMAN'S VOICE (ONSCREEN) Is he dead? \nGREGORY (ONSCREEN) Yes, Rebecca.  He's dead. \nREBECCA, a beautiful American woman, comes into view and takes our attention because she's being played by Sandra Sinclair, Pete Appleton's ex-girlfriend... \nON LUKE \nHis mouth is gaping open.  He stares at the screen. \nLUKE (a whisper) Sandra...? \nLuke stands.  Confused, he stumbles backward, moving into the lobby as the Man goes back into the auditorium with his popcorn and the door closes. \nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT \nLuke is staring at the closed auditorium doors.  Old Tim and Mrs. Terwilliger take note of his odd behavior. \nMRS. TERWILLIGER Luke?  Dear, are you all right? \nWithout answering, Luke turns and runs to the poster case. \nON THE POSTER - \"SAND PIRATES OF THE SAHARA\" \nForget the cheesy B-movie artwork.  As Luke looks at the poster, it's clear that he's remembering something.  He looks at the picture of Sandra -- then scans down to the credits block at the bottom of the poster.  His eyes lock upon \nWRITTEN BY PETER APPLETON \nLUKE My god... my god... no... \nSuddenly, all of Pete Appleton's worries have come crashing down on him... \n... because he remembers... \nINT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT \nThe warning bell DINGS! twice, but the changeover projector's carbon arcs keep sputtering and the motor keeps dying. \nHARRY (pleading) Oh, baby, make your daddy happy... \nHarry's trying to keep the projector going, as the previous reel is about to end.  Given no other choice, he finally gives the changeover projector a good swift kick. \nIt hums to life.  A perfect changeover.  Harry pets the projector. \nHARRY You're a good girl.  No matter what I say. \nAs he turns away, he feels a sudden, sharp pain in his left arm.  Wincing, he grabs his arm, staggers back towards a chair, and sits heavily. \nHe tries to clear his throat, but it dissolves into a hacking, choking COUGH.  He tries to stand, but drops to his knees, clutching his left arm harder than before. \nHARRY (in pain) Oh, Jesus... \nHarry falls to the floor, and as he does \nTHE FILM \nbreaks in the projector gate... flap!  flap!  flap!... \nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT \nLuke is still staring at the poster, lost in thought. Offscreen, we HEAR the audience WHISTLING AND HOOTING in reaction to the broken film. \nMrs. Terwilliger has been calling Luke's name, but he doesn't come out of his stupor until Old Tim comes up behind him and spins him around... \nOLD TIM Mr. Luke! \nLuke stares wide-eyed at the old man. \n", "test3_true": "LUKE (still dazed) What? \nMRS. TERWILLIGER You've got to talk to them before they tear the theater apart! \nFinally, Luke pulls himself together, hears the audience noise, and moves toward the auditorium doors. \nINT.  AUDITORIUM - NIGHT \nAmid the shouting and tossing of popcorn and debris, Luke tries to regain his composure as he strides down the aisle toward the stage. \nLUKE Come on, folks, this happens every once in a while, just settle down... \nThe crowd quiets down a bit.  Luke shields his eyes from the light and calls up to the projection booth. \nLUKE Harry!  Harry, why don't you cut the projector and bring up the house lights? \nNo reaction.  Just the flickering beam of light. \nLUKE Harry?  Harry...? \nLuke, gripped by a sudden fear, rushes up the aisle and into the lobby.  The crowd goes silent... \nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - NIGHT \nOld Tim and Mrs. Terwilliger watch as Luke tears into the lobby and makes for the balcony stairs... \nINT.  BALCONY - NIGHT \n... and charges between the seats and up the stairs to the projection booth. \nINT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - NIGHT \nLuke bursts in the sees Harry on the floor.  He rushes over and kneels down next to him. \nLUKE Jesus... \nHARRY (with difficulty) The film broke... \nLUKE I know, I know... keep still. \nA MAN pops his head into the projection booth door. \nLUKE (to the man) Get Doc Lardner. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  HARRY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nHarry is in bed, eyes closed.  Doc Lardner has a stethoscope to his chest.  He leans up and pats Harry's hand. \nHe stands and comes over to Luke and Adele, who are near the door.  Just outside, angling for a view into the room, are Old Tim and Mrs. Terwilliger. \nLARDNER It's a pretty massive heart attack. His lungs have filled with fluid, and, well... it seems as though his body is just... shutting down. \nLUKE Can we get him to the hospital? \nLARDNER Even if we could, and the move didn't kill him, there'd be very little we could do there that we can't do here. (puts his hand on Luke's shoulder) I'm sorry. \nHarry's eyelids flutter. \nHARRY (weakly) Did you... did you... \nLuke rushes to Harry's side and takes his hand. \nLUKE I'm here. \nHARRY Did you... did you... \nLUKE Did I what? \nHARRY (irritated) Did you fix the damn film?  It broke in the last reel. \nLUKE I know.  Everyone went home.  We offered them refunds. \nHARRY Anybody take it? \nLUKE A few. \nHARRY (closes his eyes) Vultures... \nLuke smiles. \nHARRY I'm not happy about this, mind you, but if I have to go, at least I'm going in my own bed, the same bed my Lily died in, and... knowing that my son is alive.  That's not too shabby, is it? \nLUKE You're not going anywhere, Harry. \nHARRY Don't tell me, I know about these things.  I've seen it before.  It's all right.  It's... all right. You're here.  Oh, God, I love you, son. \nHarry smiles.  Luke kisses his hand and leans up, whispering in Harry's ear: \nLUKE And I love you... Dad. \nHarry smiles faintly, looks at Luke.  He nods, then closes his eyes. \nHARRY (softly) Oh, so... much... lighter... \nSlowly, Harry exhales.  His face relaxes, completely at peace.  He doesn't breathe again. \n", "test3_id": 2351}

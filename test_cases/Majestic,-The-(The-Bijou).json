AUDITORIUM - DAY \nLuke, Harry and Mrs. Terwilliger walk down the aisle toward the screen.  Old Time lags a few steps behind.  At the orchestra pit, Harry climbs the steps, crosses the pit.  The screen is a sea of repair patches.  Harry pats it.  Dust flies. \nHARRY 'Fraid this has seen better days. Well, I was meaning to get a new screen, anyway. \nOLD TIM I n-need me a new uniform. \nLuke looks at Old Tim, then at Harry. \nHARRY (to Luke) I promised him a new uniform when we re-opened. (to Old Tim) And you'll get one, too. \nLUKE You know, I hate to bring this up, but screens and uniforms and paint and repairs are going to take money, which I'm willing to bet none of us has. \nSilence from the group. \nLUKE I thought so. \nBeat.  Harry brightens, clambers down the steps and races up the aisle. \nHARRY Anyone want to see the projector? \nCUT TO: \nTWO CARBON ARCS \nare squeakily being cranked together above the din of a fan motor.  A puff of smoke, then -- BZZZZZZZZZTT -- LIGHT.  A metal door is closed over the arcs. \nINT.  PROJECTION BOOTH - DAY \nHarry dances around to the other side of the projector and adjusts the focus on the beam of light.  The others look on as he gazes at the screen through the tiny window. \nHARRY Beautiful.  Bright and even from edge to edge.  See for yourself. \nThe carbons sputter and die.  The light flickers out.  Harry is crestfallen, turns off the motor. \nHARRY She's always been a bit tricky. \nCUT TO: \nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY \nMrs. Terwilliger is dusting the concession stand with a ragged feather duster, a hopeless task.  Old Tim is on a rickety ladder, replacing burned-out bulbs in the chandelier. The orange tabby cat scratches itself on the leg of the ladder. \nOld Tim climbs down and catches his breath.  Mrs. Terwilliger sneezes. \nOLD TIM Bless. \nMRS. TERWILLIGER Thank you, Timothy. \nThey both stop their work and glance warily at the door marked \"OFFICE.\" \nMRS. TERWILLIGER (sotto) What do you suppose they're talking about? \nOLD TIM Dunno.  Boy's smart. \nMRS. TERWILLIGER (brightly) Yes, he seems to be. \nOLD TIM Bad for us. \nINT.  BIJOU OFFICE - DAY \nLuke is poring over the ledger books, adding up figures on an old manual adding machine. \nLUKE Um... Harry?  Did I ever keep the books here? \nHARRY No, your mother did, then I did after she passed. \nLUKE Well, I'm the first one to admit that I don't know anything about bookkeeping, but there are some very interesting things in here. \nHe scans down a page. \nLUKE (reading) \"February 10, 1942.  Picture 'Ball of Fire.'\" \nHARRY (appreciatively) Gary Cooper.  And Barbara Stanwyck. Yowsa. \nLUKE (reading) \"Eight p.m. showtime, ninety-six admissions, receipts including concessions, $84.75... plus one fryer and two-dozen eggs.\" \nHe closes the book and looks expectantly at Harry. \nHARRY Yes? \nLUKE \"one fryer and two-dozen eggs?\" \n", "test1_true": "LUKE Yeah, I know, but poultry...? \nHARRY (rhapsodically) I know it's hard to believe, son, but this place, this little place this wasn't a theater then, this was a palace!  Any man, woman, child, you, me, it didn't matter, you bought your ticket and you walked in and you... \nHarry puts his hand on his chest and sighs. \nHARRY ... you were in a palace.  It was like a dream.  It was like heaven, like you died and went to a palace in heaven, that's what it was like. And spotless, too. \nInspired, Harry stands, takes Luke by the arm. \nHARRY Come with me! \nHe drags him out of the office and into the lobby. \nINT.  BIJOU LOBBY - DAY \nMrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim watch as Harry leads Luke through the lobby. \nHARRY (smiling) Maybe you had problems and worries out there, but once you came through that door, they didn't matter anymore.  In here, you were safe.  Maybe it was just an escape from reality, but... oh, god... it was beautiful. \nHarry leads Luke into the auditorium.  The car follows, but Mrs. Terwilliger and Old Tim stay behind. \nINT.  AUDITORIUM - DAY \nHarry trots down the aisle and looks up at the screen. \nHARRY (exuberant) Charlie Chaplin.  Keaton and Lloyd. Swanson.  And later on, Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert and Jimmy Stewart and James Cagney and Bogart and Becall and Judy and Mickey... and Fred and Ginger. \nHe turns to Luke. \nHARRY (emphatically) They... were... like... gods! \nHe points to the screen. \nHARRY And that... was the altar.  Would you remember if I told you, we felt lucky to be here, to have the privilege of watching them? (sadly) This television thing.  Why would you want to sit at home and watch a little box with a little screen? Because it's convenient?  Because you don't have to get dressed and put on a coat and a tie and a hat? Because you can just... sit there? How can you call that \"entertainment,\" all alone in your living room?  Where are the other people?  Where's the audience? \nHarry comes over to Luke. \nHARRY (emphatically) Where's the magic? \nHe stands behind Luke and whispers in his ear. \nHARRY I'll tell you.  In a place like this, the magic is all around you. All the time.  Everywhere.  In every thing. \nHe turns Luke around and looks him in the eye. \nHARRY The trick... is to see it. \nPause. \nLUKE But I... \nHARRY Son, I think you loved the Bijou even more than I did.  You've got to remember that.  You've got to. \nStill looking at Luke, Harry takes a step back, then slowly walks up the aisle, disappearing into the lobby. \nLuke walks down the aisle.  At the edge of the orchestra pit, he stands looking up at the screen.  The orange tabby cat MEOWS, and Luke glances toward it, standing onstage by the edge of the screen.

The radio is on, and Patti Page is singing \"The Tennessee Waltz.\" \nThere's a noise offscreen, and Lardner looks up.  In the entrance hall, the front door opens. \nADELE \"DELLY\" LARDNER \nenters.  She's a strikingly beautiful woman in her late 20s. She takes off a felt cap, and her long, auburn hair cascades down. \nADELE Dad? \nLARDNER Delly?  In here. \nLardner rises as Adele comes into the living room.  They embrace warmly. \nLARDNER How'd it go? \nADELE Not as bad as I thought it would. I think I passed. \nLARDNER (kisses her forehead) That's my girl! (he hugs her again) Did you...? \nADELE No hiccups, which was good.  Who wants an attorney who gets the hiccups when she gets nervous? (\"serious\" lawyer voice) \"Your (hic!) honor, I (hic!) object!\" \nThey laugh. \nLARDNER I always told you, baby... (taps her head) ... it's all up here. \nLardner gives her an extra squeeze, continues to hold onto her just a bit too long.  Adele detects something amiss. \nADELE Dad?

MABEL'S DINER - DAY \nMabel and Bob listen to the hearing on a radio in the packed diner. \nCLYDE (ON RADIO) Now, I see that you've been running a movie theater in Lawson called \"The Bijou,\" is that also true? \nPETE (ON RADIO) Yes sir.  But I didn't go to Lawson to run The Bijou, that was... that was something that just happened. You see, I was involved in an accident in Lawson, and I spent some time recovering there. \nINT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY \nClyde holds up copies of the Los Angeles Examiner and Los Angeles Times with Pete's picture on the front page. \nCLYDE Anyone who reads the newspaper is quite familiar with your... \"accident,\" Mr. Appleton.  An accident which, conveniently, came hard upon your dismissal from United Pictures.  Tell us, this \"accident\" of yours, are we given to understand that it affected your memory? \nPETE Yes. \nCLYDE And what is the state of your memory now? \nBeat.  Pete smiles. \nPETE I'm sorry, what was the question? \nThe audience LAUGHS.  Clyde nods at Pete, forces a tight smile. \nCLYDE We... appreciate... your little note of levity, Mr. Appleton, but this is a very serious matter, and it merits your fullest attention. (back to business) That state of your memory now, Mr. Appleton? \nINT.  WYATT'S HARDWARE - DAY \nAvery Wyatt listens to the hearing on a store radio.  Spencer comes around the paint aisle, wiping his hands on his apron. He moves to the radio and listens solemnly. \nPETE (ON RADIO) Sir, are you referring to the fact that I was suffering from amnesia, and I've since recovered my memory? \nINT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY \nCLYDE (impatient) I'm interested in knowing if you remember things you did in your past, or if they've been conveniently \"blotted out\" as a result of your \"accident.\" \nPETE (smiling) Mr. Clyde, I remember everything. \nCLYDE Good.  Good. (holds up a piece of paper) Now, I hold in my hand a photostatic copy of the attendance roster for the \"Bread Instead of Bullets Club\" of the University of California, Los Angeles, dated October 11, 1935.  A copy of this paper is before you, Mr. Appleton. Do you recognize it? \nPete looks on the table and finds the roster.  He's surprised to see it. \nPETE Yes... yes, I do. \nCLYDE Referring to line thirty-seven of the document, does your printed name and signature appear there? \nPETE Yes it does. \nCLYDE Mr. Appleton, please tell this committee what was the nature and purpose of the \"Bread Instead of Bullets Club?\" \nPETE Mr. Clyde, do you want to know what I knew then, or do you want to know what I know now?  They're two different things? \nCLYDE Start with what you knew then. \nPETE Well, I'd direct the attention of counsel and committee to line thirty-six of the document, and the name printed and signed there. \nCLYDE We see it.  For the record, it reads \"Lucille Angstrom.\"  What's the point of this? \nPETE Well, that's what I knew then.  Or who I knew, I should say.  You see, I was trying to court Miss Angstrom.  I went to the meeting to impress her. \nCLYDE (grinning) Are you asking this committee to believe that you attended a meeting of a communist party front organization in order to impress a girl? \nPETE (slyly) Well, if you'd seen Miss Angstrom... \nThe audience LAUGHS.  Doyle BANGS his gavel. \nPETE You asked for the truth.  That's the truth.  I had no idea what the meeting was about.  I just sat through it so I could be near her. I'm sure even a Majority Counsel like yourself is familiar with the concept of impressing a girl. \nThe audience LAUGHS.  Clyde shoots a look at Doyle, who BANGS his gavel. \nDOYLE Chamber will come to order. \nClyde shuffles some papers and looks back at Pete. \nCLYDE All right, Mr. Appleton.  That was what you knew then.  What do you know now? \nPETE (takes a deep breath) Well, I know that I lost my job because of one meeting I went to when I was a kid in college.  I know that I've been branded a communist, which I'm not, but even if I was, it shouldn't matter, or what do we have a Bill Of Rights for? \nCLYDE Mr. Chairman, the witness is being non-responsive... \nA few members of the audience APPLAUD.  As Pete speaks, their numbers grow. \nPETE (passionately) I know that a lot of good, honest, decent people, people that I consider my true friends, feel betrayed by me, not because of who and what I am, but because of what you say I am!  I know that I... \nDoyle BANGS his gavel several times.  Pete stops and the room falls quiet. \nDOYLE (emphatically) Mr. Appleton, you will respond to the questions of this committee without elaboration or speechmaking, or the chair will find you in Contempt Of Congress. You will not be warned again, is that clear? (he lets this sink in, then) Continue, Mr. Clyde. \nCLYDE (looking down at his desk) Mr. Appleton... \nClyde takes a long pause for effect, then looks up at Pete. \nCLYDE Are you now, or have you ever been, a member of the communist party? \nPETE No, sir. \nCLYDE (holding up the roster) Are you refuting this evidence and your previous testimony? \n", "test2_true": "CLYDE Yet you're contradicting yourself. You earlier testified that you attended a meeting of a communist party-run organization, yet you just said, under oath, that you were not now -- nor ever -- a member of the communist party. \nPETE That's not a contradiction at all, sir.  I went to the meeting, but I didn't go as a member. \nCLYDE Well, then, as what did you go? \nBeat.  Pete smiles. \nPETE I'm a little hesitant to say. \nDOYLE The witness need not be hesitant to say anything before this committee, as long as it's the truth. \nPete shifts in his chair, then leans into the microphone. \nPETE Well, I went as... a horny young man. \nThe chamber erupts in LAUGHTER.  Even the other COMMITTEE MEMBERS are laughing, except Clyde and Doyle, who BANGS his gavel vigorously. \nINT.  SHERIFF'S OFFICE - DAY \nSheriff Eldridge and Daley Thornhill listen to the hearing on the radio.  They are both laughing at Pete's last comment. \nELDRIDGE Damn, he don't wanna spar with these boys.  They'll eat him alive. \nINT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY \nThe room settles.  Doyle wags his finger accusingly at Pete. \nDOYLE (angry) Mr. Appleton, you are making light of a legally constituted committee of the United States Congress. Believe you me, you do not want to incur our wrath. \nPETE (matter-of-factly) I'm sorry, sir, I have no intention of making light of this committee. And I have no intention of incurring your wrath, Mr. Chairman. I have a few friends who have already incurred your wrath. They've sent me letters from jail. \nCLYDE (interrupting) Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman, the witness is making another speech. I would ask that Mr. Appleton be admonished... \nDOYLE (indifferent) Mr. Appleton, there is no question before you at this time, but I'm sure Mr. Clyde has plenty more prepared, and if you'd like to either answer them or plead the Fifth Amendment, we can at least get on with the business of this committee. \nINT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY \nAdele moves to within inches of the TV screen. \nADELE Tell them Pete.  Tell them... \nPETE (ON TV) (wrestling with this) Mr. Chairman, as I understand it, the Fifth Amendment pertains to self-incrimination, and I can't incriminate myself because I've done nothing wrong.  Besides, incrimination is why you have Mr. Clyde working for you. \nCLYDE (ON TV) Mr. Chairman... \nINT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY \nClyde is still protesting, but Doyle waves him off. \nDOYLE Well then, Mr. Appleton, just what is your intention? \nPete's sweating under the lights.  He's bluffed his last bluff, and he's on the ropes.  He reaches into his pocket... and takes out the prepared statement. \nINT.  LARDNER LIVING ROOM - DAY \nPETE (ON TV) I... Mr. Chairman, I have a prepared statement I'd like to read... \nADELE \nHer hand goes to her mouth. \nADELE Oh, Pete.  No... \nINT.  BILTMORE HOTEL GRAND BALLROOM - DAY \nDOYLE Go ahead, Mr. Appleton. \nPETE (slowly reading) \"I, Peter Appleton, do hereby...\" \nHe stops suddenly.  Pause. \nDOYLE Mr. Appleton?  Mr. Appleton? \nPETE I... I need a drink of water. \nDOYLE Go ahead, son. \nPete fills a glass from the pitcher.  Nervously, he spills a bit, and is splashes onto his coat.  As some of the spectators chuckle, Pete brushes the water off.  He reaches into his pocket, and pulls out Adele's copy of the constitution.  The cover is wet.  He wipes it off and sets it down on the table. \nHe takes a sip of water.  Looks at the book.  Picks it up. \nPete's terrified, but in control.  He speaks slowly -- he's making this up and thinking it out as he goes. \nPETE Mr. Chairman... there's... another Amendment... that I'd like to invoke at this time, but it's not the Fifth Amendment.  I wonder if you're familiar with it. \nDOYLE Mr. Appleton, you will... \nHe opens the book and reads, tentatively at first. \nPETE \"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\" \nPause.

Now fully confident. \nPETE That's the First Amendment, Mr. Chairman.  It's the backbone of this nation.  It's everything that gives us the potential to be right and good and just -- if only we'd live up to that potential.  It's what gives me the right to sit in this chair and say my piece before this committee without fear.  It's the most important part of the contract that every citizen has with this country.  And even though this contract... (he holds up the book) ... the Constitution and the Bill of Rights -- even though they're just pieces of paper with signatures on them -- they're the only contracts we have that are most definitely not subject to renegotiation.  Not by you, Mr. Chairman, not by you, Mr. Clyde, not by any member of this committee -- or anyone else -- ever. \nPin-drop silence in the room.  Pete scans the faces of the panel.  All betray anger. \nON LEO \nHe can't help but smile and nod appreciatively. \nPETE And when you get right down to it, that's really all I have to say to this committee.  Good morning. \nAnd with that, Pete closes the book, picks up the prepared statement, rips it up, pushes back his chair, stands and walks toward the door.  The cameras swing with him, and FLASHBULBS fire like machine guns.  Doyle BANGS his gavel insistently. \nDOYLE The witness will resume his seat! Did you hear me?!  You are not excused, Mr. Appleton! \nAnd then, slowly, APPLAUSE builds in the chamber, reaching a crescendo as Pete reaches the door and exits. \nCLYDE Mr. Chairman!  Mr. Chairman...! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  BILTMORE HOTEL - DAY \nAs Pete exits the hotel, a DOZEN REPORTERS AND PHOTOGRAPHERS have him completely surrounded.  FLASHBULBS pop.  He's taken aback, flustered. \nFIRST REPORTER (seeing Pete) There he is! \nSECOND REPORTER Pete!  Are you going back to writing pictures? \nPETE I don't know... \nTHIRD REPORTER You a commie, Pete? \nPETE No, of course not... \nSECOND REPORTER What about the girl, Pete?  You gonna marry her?  Is she coming to Hollywood, or are you... \nPETE Look, fellas, I don't have anything to say... \nPete is trapped in the crowd, when he feels a hand on his shoulder. \nLEO \nspins him around, and pushes him through the crowd toward the curb. \nLEO Come on, kid. \nAt the curb is a black Cadillac limousine.  Leo hauls open the back door and pushes Pete in, before climbing in himself. \nThe limo drives away, as the reporters give chase. \nINT.  LIMO (MOVING) - DAY \nLeo and Pete sit side-by-side in silence for a moment.  Leo breaks it. \nLEO That was quite a show you gave them today.  We shoulda sold tickets. \nPETE I'm not sorry for what I said. \nLEO No, of course not, why should you be sorry?  You're the new Peter Appleton.  You exercised your rights as a solid citizen, first amendment, freedom of speech, all that.  Very noble. \nThey sit in silence again for a moment until Leo reaches into his pocket and withdraws a gold cigarette case, which he opens and offers to Pete. \nLEO Cigarette? \nPETE No thanks. \nLeo takes one for himself and lights up.  Pete takes off his hat and nervously scratches his head. \nLEO When'd you quit smoking? \nPETE Luke didn't smoke. \nLEO Oh, I see.  But you're not Luke. You're Peter Appleton, the picture writer. \nPETE (laughs) Not any more. \nLEO Why not? \nPETE Leo, you were in there, you saw what I did.  You think they're gonna let me write pictures?  Hell, they're probably gonna throw my ass in jail. \nLEO (with a smile) Not at all. \nPETE Besides, I don't even know if I want to write anymore. \nLEO (snickering) What, you're going to go back to that hick town and run the projector and marry the doctor's daughter? \nBut before Pete can answer... \nLEO Peter, I'm an agent.  I buy lunches and get deals made for guys like you.  That's what I do.  You're a writer.  You write pictures. That's what you do.  And trust me, you'll be back doing it again tomorrow morning. \nPETE What do you mean? \nLEO Kid, you gave them what they wanted.  This committee, it feeds on names.  The more names, the better.  But for some high-profile witnesses, like yourself, any name will do. \nPETE Leo, I didn't give them the names. I wouldn't do that. \n", "test3_true": "Pete freezes.  He slowly turns to Leo. \nPETE (warily) Her name was right there in front of them.  They gave it to me, I didn't give it to them. \nLEO Well, that's not what they think. \nPETE Leo, she was... she was a girl I knew in college... \nLEO You should keep track of your old school chums.  Turns out she eventually joined the communist party. (takes a puff) On top of which, she's Lucy Angstrom Hirschfeld now, and she happens to be a writer for \"Studio One\" on CBS. \nPETE (realization dawning) Oh god, oh, god, no, I... \nLEO So, our lawyers had a talk with the Committee's lawyers.  That Elvin Clyde fella won't be too happy about it, but we cut a deal. They cleared you -- and they're gonna thank you publicly for your testimony purging yourself. \nPETE Thank me publicly?  For what?  For ruining this woman's life? \nLEO (dismissive) Climb down off your cross.  They already knew about her. (off his look) She was subpoenaed six months ago! Who the hell do you think named you? \nPete is dumbstruck.  He slumps in his seat, ashen. \nLEO (he couldn't be happier) All of which means... \"Ashes To Ashes\" is gonna be made, and you've got your job back.

Pete vacantly grabs his suitcase and gets out.  Leo shuts the door and calls after him, waving Pete's hat. \nLEO Peter!  Your hat! \nPete comes back and takes his hat.  Leo grabs his hand. \nLEO I was lookin' out for you all the time, kid.  You did good.  I'm real proud of you. (to the driver) Okay, let's go.

PETE'S APARTMENT (L.A.) - DAY \nThe door opens, revealing the Super, followed by a sullen Pete, carrying his suitcases and hat.  He sets them down and goes to the coffee table, where his boxes of belongings from the studio have been gathering dust these last three months. \nSUPER (handing him a key) Here's a new key for ya.  That Mr. Kubelsky, he's got you paid up through this month.  You got one swell friend there. \nThe Super moves to the door and turns back. \nSUPER Good to have you back, Pete. \nHe exits as Pete reaches into one of the boxes and pulls out the tin-toy fire truck.  Distractedly, Pete puts the toy back in the box and replies too late: \nPETE Thanks... \nHe sets his suitcase down and takes off his coat.  As he does, Adele's copy of the Constitution slips out of his coat pocket and falls open to the floor. \nPete picks it up and absently turns it over -- and the inscription inside the front cover catches his eye: \nTO DELLY, THE GIRL WITH ALL THE ANSWERS. LOVE, LUKE \nPete closes the book.  He thinks for a moment, then glances over at the phone.  He picks it up and dials \"0.\" \nPETE Western Union, please. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  TRAIN (MOVING) - DAY \nOur view of the moving train is from outside, as it speeds up the spectacular coastline north of Santa Barbara.  Looking into one of the train's windows, we SEE Pete sitting, staring out at the passing scenery. \nPETE'S NARRATION (V.O.) Dear Adele, on my way back to Lawson STOP.  That is, if they'll have me STOP.  Train arrives four p.m. STOP.  Hope you can be there STOP.  Pete. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT.  LAWSON PASSENGER DEPOT - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe train is just pulling in to Lawson.  As it SHUDDERS to a halt, the door of the passenger compartment opens and Pete steps out -- looks -- and his jaw drops open... \nHIS POV \nThe ENTIRE TOWN has turned out.  They're all there, smiling broadly.  A large, hand-lettered banner reads: \nWELCOME HOME PETE! LAWSON'S FAVORITE SON \nA CHEER goes up from the crowd, breaking the silence.  Pete descends from the train and moves into the throng.  The first two people he encounters are Bob Leffert and Mabel Lanier. bob sticks out his good hand and Pete takes it, both smiling as they shake hands vigorously. \nBOB Luke... um, I mean, Pete, if it weren't for you, I wouldn't have had the nerve to ask this fine woman to marry me. \nMabel's mouth drops open. \nPETE Bob, congratulations!  When'd you ask her? \nMABEL Holy moley!  Just now! (to Bob) Yes, Bob!  Yes! \nAs Mabel kisses Bob for all she's worth, Pete continues into the crowd, where he's kissed, embraced, patted on the back. \nADELE \nis at the back of the crowd, working her way to the front. She rushes into Pete's arms, and they kiss.  Another CHEER goes up. \n", "test3_id": 2351}

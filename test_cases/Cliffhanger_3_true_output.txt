KRISTEL (keying mike) Copy, FAA. Distress call came at approximately eleven hundred hours yesterday. I investigated -- the call turned out to be a false alarm. Over. 
EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - DAY 
Stuart gestures with exasperated triumph. 
STUART Please repeat, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- distress call was a false alarm? -- over -- 
KRISTEL (O.S.) (over radio) Repeat, distress call was a definite false alarm -- we've had several here. Somebody's sick idea of a joke. Do you require further assistance -- over -- 
STUART Not from you. Thanks, Rocky Mountain Rescue -- over and out -- 
Stuart shuts off the radio with finality. 
STUART I don't want to say I told you so. But I did. Can I go back to work now? 
EXT. HELICOPTER/TOWER CLEARING - DAY 
Kristel smiles and puts the radio mike back into its bracket. 
TRAVERS I almost believed you myself. 
Travers smiles and turns, looking at 
HAL 
trembling with fury and grief, bent over Frank's body as the last trace of vapor -- his breath -- trails from his lips. He's gone. Hal gently closes the eyes of his friend. 
HAL (quiet) Goodbye, Frank. 
Travers moves up behind Hal and kicks him. 
TRAVERS Time for number three. Unless you want to have a longer conversation with him elsewhere. 
HAL (low) Fuck off. 
Travers kicks him in the face, knocking him into the snow. 
HAL I think I'll wait here. You just murdered three of my friends. Sooner or later, whoever's chasing you is going to show up and return the favor, and I'd love to watch. 
Travers puts his gun at Hal's forehead and shrugs. 
TRAVERS Suit yourself. You see, we just had a little interface with several branches of the federal government -- one of whose members I know has zero imagination -- and I can tell you, the cavalry just isn't going to make it by this week. (beat) No, you're taking us where we want to go. Because you want to return that favor and you want to do more than watch. You want to kill me -- more than anything, even more than you want to keep on breathing, and with a little more time you pray you'll get that chance. (tightens trigger) Am I right? 
Hal's answer is a stony, loathing stare. He gets up. But -- 
INSERT - HAL'S HAND 
-- we can see Hal has palmed something from Frank's body. 
INT. CAVE - GABE AND MAGGIE 
Dust from the rockslide is drifting past the cave opening, but the worst is over. Gabe rolls Maggie over carefully. 
GABE Are you okay? 
MAGGIE My ears are ringing -- but I'm all right. Gabe, what's going on? 
GABE (shows money in his pack) This. That plane crash -- it's a half dozen guys who were smart enough to steal fifty million bucks, but dumb enough to drop it all over the range. They've got Hal as a bird dog -- and right now they're heading for the rest of it. 
MAGGIE Where? 
GABE It's close to the lake -- Hal's probably leading them on the slowest possible route down to it. (stiffly gets up) I can get there first -- all I have to do is make it along the north wall to the Bitker ladder -- 
MAGGIE "All?" Jesus, Gabe -- what do you expect to do then? 
GABE (aching) Something -- subtle. 
Gabe lurches towards the cave opening, looking more like Quasimodo than a champion climber. Maggie stops him. 
MAGGIE I'm going with you. 
GABE No way. You're climbing back down -- try to get to the station or find some help. 
MAGGIE I'm just as good a climber as you are -- and right now, I'm definitely in better shape. 
GABE (hard) And you're definitely not going -- 
Maggie stares Gabe down. Guess who won all the arguments when they were together. Gabe's face is a portrait of familiar exasperation. 
GABE Okay. Come on -- 
As they move out of the cave together, Gabe favors one foot. 
GABE -- but the second you slow me down, I'm leaving -- (slips on sore leg, Maggie catches him) -- I'm leaving you behind. Understood? 
MAGGIE (helping Gabe out) Anything you say, Gabe. 
EXT. TREASURY PLANE CRASH SITE - ON CHUNK OF WRECKAGE 
If you have a good imagination, this corner of charcoal looks like it could have been -- 
WRIGHT (O.S.) One of the currency cases. 
WRIGHT AND DAVIS 
are standing over some of the wreckage. One of the suits bags and tags the "briefcase". 
DAVIS We've tested the ash inside -- it's the right paper. 
WRIGHT What about the men? 
DAVIS It's -- hard to tell. But forensics says yes. All of them were in the plane. 
WRIGHT (sags with the news) Everything's accounted for, then -- time to head back and start making excuses. (beat) Fifty million bucks up in smoke, and I just don't give a shit. It's one more run of the press. But we lost five good men and they aren't so easily replaced. (beat) Especially a guy like Travers.

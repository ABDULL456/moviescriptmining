{"train": "\"HUMAN NATURE\" \nby \nCharlie Kaufman \nMay 20, 1995 \nFIRST DRAFT \nBLACKNESS. \nThere is a gunshot. A crow screams. A fluttering of wings. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nBird's-eye view. We circle lazily above the forest. \nThrough a break in the trees, we catch an occasional glimpse of a prostrate form on the ground. As the circling camera gets closer we see that the form is a human body. \nCUT TO: \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP OF LILA TALKING TO THE CAMERA \nLILA I'm not sorry. \nA bead of sweat trickles down her cheek. Then: a blinding flash of light obliterates her face. \nCUT TO: \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP OF PUFF TALKING TO THE CAMERA \nPUFF I am sorry. \nA tear wells in Puff's eye and runs down his face. Another blinding flash of light. \nCUT TO: \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP OF NATHAN TALKING TO THE CAMERA \nNATHAN I don't even know what sorry means anymore. \nAs Nathan speaks, a trickle of blood drips down his face from his out-of-frame forehead. Another blinding flash of light. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nIt's a frenetic hand-held shot as Lila is pulled from a police car and dragged into the precinct house. Cameras flash. Reporters shout questions. Lila attempts to shield her face from view, but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch her shoulders. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nA ratty interrogation room. Institutional green walls. \nBeat-up file cabinets. Dark. A bit of fluorescent light spills in through the frosted glass door. Lila, thirties, sits at the end of a long table. A reel-to-reel tape recorder whirs in front of her. She is smoking. Three fat, mean-looking cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table. One of the cops eyes her lasciviously. Lila's hand shakes as she brings the cigarette to her mouth. \nLILA I'm not sorry. So I spend the rest of my life in jail. So what? I've been in jail my whole life anyway. A jail of blood and tissue and coursing hormones... \nOne of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose. \nIt's going to be a long night. \nLILA ...a jail called the human body. \nThe lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at Lila's reference to \"human body.\" \nLILA My soul held prisoner in this reeking, stench-ridden bag of bones and entrails. A bag of feces and piss and fibroid cysts in my tits and precancerous moles on my sun-damaged back... \nThe lascivious cop gags, then vomits on the floor. Lila drags on her cigarette, calmer now. \nThe cop who vomited, gags again. Lila stares at him. Her face is hard, blank. She stubs out her cigarette. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \nPuff testifies before the committee. \nPUFF I don't think there's anyone in the world who doesn't know by now that I was raised in the wilderness by an ape. Well, to be fair, by a man who thought himself an ape, but it amounts to the same thing gentlemen, does it not? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FOREST CLEARING - DAY. \nThis has a faded, \"memory\" look also. A naked, bearded, dirty middle-aged man and a naked, dirty ten year old Puff walk along like apes, crouched over and dragging their knuckles. \nPUFF (V.O.) My father escaped from a New Jersey mental institution in 1963. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nIt's raining and deserted. Puff's father, in pajamas, comes tearing around the corner. He runs crazily towards the camera, waving his arms, puffing out his cheeks. \nPUFF (V.O.) He had been committed the previous year after applying one too many times at our local zoo for the job of \"apprentice ape.\" \nPuff's father passes a newspaper vending machine, stops, goes back and examines the headline. It reads: President Kennedy Assassinated. Puff's father looks heavenward and clutches at his temples in despair. \nPUFF (V.O.) My father saw what the human race had come to while he was... in captivity. He felt something had to be done to create a better world. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - NIGHT \nPuff's father climbs out a second story window with a small bundle in his arms. He runs off into the night. \nPUFF (V.O.) He stole little me from my mother, his ex-wife, and raised me, with love and tenderness and respect, as an ape like himself. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \nPuff looks pointedly at the congressman. \nPUFF Apes don't assassinate their presidents, gentlemen. \nThe congressmen are shamed: they look down, they take notes, they mumble instructions to the assistants seated behind them. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nAn adult Puff and his now older father sit on the forest floor and pick bugs off each other and eat them. \nPUFF (V.O.) Until quite recently I believed myself to be an ape, although I didn't know specifically what type. Apes don't think in terms of type. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \nPuff testifies. \nPUFF It might be argued, gentlemen, that apes don't even know that they are apes. In retrospect, however, I'd say that I was a pygmy chimp. \nPuff holds up an illustration of a pygmy chimp. Several reporters run from the room: a scoop! \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE SPACE - DAY \nNathan talks to nobody in particular. \nNATHAN I have to say I always hated apes. Of course I don't any longer. I don't even know what hate means now. But while alive, I hated apes. I blame my parents. I mean, I don't blame them. I don't know what blame is, really, anymore, but I think they influenced me in my ape-hating tendencies. \nFEMALE ROOMMATE (pegged) You're fucked up, Lila. (out the door) Why don't you fucking try electrolysis or something? Figure it out for chrissake. \nThe door slams. Lila hugs her knees to her chest. \nLILA (V.O.) At sixty dollars an hour, electrolysis was not a feasible solution. I explored my alternatives. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ART MUSEUM - DAY \nTwelve year old Lila walks sadly through an art museum. she looks at various old portraits of men. She studies their facial hair. When she turns a corner, she is shocked to see a large Renaissance painting of a naked woman entirely covered with fur. She hurries to it. She looks at the placard next to the painting. It is a painting of Mary Magdalene. \nLILA (V.O.) I remember once coming across a painting of Mary Magdalene entirely covered with fur. I guess that's where I got the idea that maybe the Catholic Church might be a place that encouraged excessive hair growth in its women. \nINT. CONVENT - DAY \nLila, in a nun's habit, is on her knees praying. \nLILA (V.O.) So I became a nun. \nLILA Heavenly Father... (sighs) ...please let this hair go away. \nLILA (V.O.) But my prayers were always so selfish. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FIELD - NIGHT \nA bunch of naked women dance and chat around a campfire. \nLila is there, pretty hairy. So are many of the other women. \nLILA (V.O.) I tried being a lesbian separatist. \nLESBIANS (chanting) A woman without a man / Is like a fish without a bicycle. \nLILA (V.O.) But I guess I just wasn't attracted to women, even hostile, man-hating, hairy ones who wore sensible shoes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. TENT - DAY \nLila, in a full beard, sits on a throne before a crowd of gawking, dumb-looking, mouth-breathing children. Next to her on a separate stage is a sour-looking, middle-aged midget man sitting on a throne, staring blankly into space. \nLILA (V.O.) For a while I was a professional circus freak. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. TENT - DAY \nLila, in a Santa suit, with beard sprayed white, sits on a throne in front of a crowd of gawking, dumb-looking, mouth- breathing children. One of them is on her lap. Next to her sits the sour midget, dressed in an elf suit. \nLILA (V.O.) During the holiday season, they made us wear costumes. \nLILA (depressed) Ho ho ho. \nKID ON HER LAP That's not real. \nThe kid pulls Lila's beard. \nLILA Ow! You little fuck. \nLILA (V.O.) Aside from the great dental, this occupation was not pleasant. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - NIGHT \nLila walks home. She's wrapped in winter clothing, but we can still see a bit of her white beard. It's snowing. The street is deserted. She spots a lighted window, she peers in. It's a warm family scene. Large group of chatting, laughing people. Fire in the fireplace. Big turkey on the table. \nLILA (V.O.) They say the holidays are difficult for a lot of people. \nLila looks down the street and sees dozens of lonely-looking people peering forlornly in warmly lit windows. Some on ladders to peer in second-floor windows. Lila sighs. \nNathan blushes. Lila stares at him for a long moment. Her thoughts are unreadable. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELECTROLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nLila lies on her back. Rose works on her breasts. \nROSE So? \nLILA I really like him, Rose. He's so... (searching) ...passionate about his work. \nROSE My brother says he likes you, too. \nLILA (pleased) Really? \nROSE Yeah. Says he likes you even more than he likes his own mother. And according to my brother Nathan's abormally close with his mother. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE SPACE - DAY \nNathan talks. \nNATHAN I began going to a therapist when I was in my thirties, because I felt that I wasn't enjoying life the way my friends were. (beat) After a time my childhood came up. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM - DAY \nIt is another sepia scene. Nathan as a ten year old sits at the table with his parents. There is a bowl of salad in front of each of them. Everyone's head is bowed in prayer. \nFATHER Lord, we thank you for this bountiful gift we are about to receive. \nALL Amen. \nEyes open, and young Nathan reaches for a fork to eat the salad. He grabs the wrong fork. Mother's eyes widen in horror. \nMOTHER My God, no! My God! (disappointed) Oh, Nathan. \nNathan looks up. \nMOTHER That is the wrong fork, young man. (to father) Harold, tell the boy. \nFATHER That is the wrong fork, young man. \nNATHAN AS A BOY (panicky) I'll use the right one. I'm sorry. I forgot. \nMOTHER Harold, tell the boy more. \nFATHER Too late. Go to your room. \nNATHAN AS A BOY But... \nMOTHER Harold! Tell the boy again. \nFATHER (looking at mother) No \"buts.\" Go to your room now. \nMOTHER (looking at father) And? \nFATHER And think about what you've done. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nAdult Nathan sits on the couch, dabbing at his eyes. \nWendall, his therapist sits across from him and writes something in his notebook. \nWENDALL And do you think maybe this early childhood indoctrination has something to do with your interest in table manners in the present. \nNathan thinks long and hard about this. He seems to be really straining, squinting his eyes. Finally: \nNathan drives. He's dressed in spanking new, freshly starched safari clothes, big shiny new hiking boots. Lila sits in the front passenger seat. She is dressed in a costume identical to Nathan's, but, as opposed to Nathan, she seems awkward in it. She fidgets in it, straightens it, sighs, comes to terms with it, and looks dreamily out the window at the passing trees. She is home. That's all that matters. \nNATHAN Darling, did you bring the insect repellent lotion? \nLILA Yes, darling. \nNATHAN (beat) Oh, and the sun block? \nLILA Of course. \nNATHAN What SPF, sweetie? \nLILA Fifteen. \nNATHAN Perfectomundo! We are ready! (beat) Say, wouldn't it be wonderful to have an insect repellent lotion that also worked as a sun block? Think of all the time one would save. \nLILA Yes, darling. \nNATHAN I think I'll get Johannsen in chemistry on that. (beat) Oh! Did you bring the first aid kit? \nLILA Yes. \nNATHAN Flares? \nLILA Absolutely. \nNATHAN We could call it \"Quit Bugging Me, Sunny.\" (laughs a lot) Get it? Sunny. S-u-n-n-y. \nLILA (laughs appreciatively) That's very funny. \nNATHAN I love you so much. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \nPuff testifies. \nPUFF Then, gentlemen, one day I saw something I hadn't seen since my father died in a freak accident involving a rotted log and four thousand bees stinging his head... I saw other human beings. They chattered away at each other in what appeared to be gibberish. Later I learned it was English. Now I wonder if perhaps my initial assessment hadn't been correct. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nPuff's POV: Through some brush we watch Nathan and Lila hiking. We hear Puff's loud heavy breathing and, in the distance, the relentless gibberish chatter of Nathan and Lila. Puff moves. Lila glances over. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nLila talks. \nLILA It was a flash of white. I ruled out deer immediately. Too... upright. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOREST - DAY \nWe're with Lila and Nathan now. Lila has stopped and is peering into the distance. \nLILA Did you see that? \nNATHAN What? \nLILA I don't know. Something. \nNATHAN A deer? \nLILA No. Too... upright. Might've been a person. \nNATHAN (nervously) It might behoove us to turn back at this point. \nLila walks in the direction of the sighting. \nNATHAN You'll catch cold. It's cold. (beat) What do you suppose he is, a survivalist? \nLILA I think he's feral. \nNATHAN (jumping back) Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies! \nLILA He looks perfectly fine. \nNATHAN I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do. \nLILA I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your... \nNATHAN (thinking) Actually, I just had an amusing thought. \nLILA What? \nNATHAN (musing) Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated? \nLILA Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal. \nNATHAN It's perfect! \nLILA Nathan, what the hell are you talking about? \nNATHAN (doing a little dance) Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject. \nLILA Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan. \nNATHAN (ranting) Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous. \nLILA I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here. \nNATHAN Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality. \nLILA (weakening resolve) You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan. \nNATHAN Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson. \nLila looks off into the distance, her eyes brimming with tears. As Nathan continues his speech, we move closer and closer into Lila's eyes. Nathan's voice fades into nothing by the time we dissolve. \nNATHAN Belonging to something, a person or a society, is a basic human craving. We are communal creatures. This poor soul has no one, nothing... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CLIFF - SUNSET \nA naked, very hairy Lila sits by herself on the cliff and watches the sunset. There's a chill in the air and she shivers and hugs herself. \nLILA Oh God, I have no one. Nothing. You give me this beautiful gift, this glorious sunset. But with no one to say \"isn't that a beautiful sunset\" to, it becomes meaningless, just another stupid sunset. They happen everyday. So what? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nLila is hovering over the unconscious Puff. Nathan's voice comes back into focus. He is still speechifying. \nNATHAN ...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon... \nLILA All right. \nNATHAN Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAB - DAY \nNathan hovers over the Lucite case with the tiny dinner table in it. His assistant, Gabrielle, presses a button, a door opens, and two white mice scurry in. The male pulls out a chair for the female. The female climbs up on the chair, and the male pushes the chair in, then scurries around to the other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair. The Lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating. Nathan scribbles in his notebook. \nGABRIELLE Doctor... \nNathan looks up. Gabrielle jerks her head in the direction of a very large Lucite case. Inside, Puff, now dressed in a diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes, is stirring. Nathan and Gabrielle hurry over. \nNATHAN Good morning. \nGABRIELLE You're so sweet. Oh, why are there not more men out there like you? \nGabrielle starts to cry softly. Nathan doesn't know what to do. His eyes dart around, then: \nNATHAN There there. \nGabrielle looks up at him appreciatively. She sniffs. \nGABRIELLE You know just the right thing to say. \nShe reaches across the table and touches his hand lightly for a moment. \nNATHAN Listen, you're the best assistant I've ever had... Gabrielle. \nGABRIELLE (smiles) I like it when you say my name. Is that stupid? \nCUT TO: \nINT. NATHAN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNathan, in his pajamas, lies in bed reading. He looks up. \nNATHAN What are you doing in there? \nLILA (O.S.) Nothing. Be right out. \nThe phone rings. Nathan picks it up. \nNATHAN Hello? (beat, happily) Oh, hi... Gabrielle! \nNathan sits up in bed. \nLILA (O.S.) Who is it? \nNATHAN Uh-huh. Right, Gabrielle. Right. \nNathan laughs. \nLILA (O.S.) Who is it? \nNATHAN (into phone) Absolutely, Gabrielle. (covering phone, testily) Someone from work! (into phone) Sorry about that, Gabrielle. Uh-huh. Exactly. \nNathan laughs. \nLILA (O.S.) Who from work? \nNATHAN (into phone) Excuse me one second, would you, Gabrielle? \nNathan puts down the phone and heads to the bathroom. \nLILA (O.S.) Who is it, Nathan? \nNathan opens the bathroom door. \nNATHAN Look, Lila, when I'm on a work... \nLila turns with a gasp. She has shaving cream all over her chest. Nathan looks stunned. He backs away. \nLILA Nathan, I... \nCUT TO: \nINT. GABRIELLE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe lights are low. The room is peppered with lit candles. \nGabrielle, in a slip, lies on her bed, eating cherries from a bowl, and listening to Nathan and Lila's conversation on speaker. \nLILA (O.S.) It's hormonal, Nathan. I can't help it. I'm sorry. \nNATHAN (O.S.) Your entire body? \nLILA (O.S.) I'm getting electrolysis. It's working, but it takes time. So meanwhile I have to... \nNathan stares at her, transfixed. She pretends not to notice. \nGABRIELLE Shall we close up, then? \nNATHAN Maybe we should just sit for a while. It's very peaceful. \nGABRIELLE It's nice, yes. I'm glad I ran into you, both in our silly pajamas. It is two happy coincidences, no? \nNATHAN Yes. Happy happy. \nGABRIELLE Yet you look so sad. A great man like you should not be sad. \nNATHAN I'm fine. Life is funny, that's all. \nGabrielle stands. She stretches languorously, revealing a lot of leg. \nGABRIELLE I am sleepy. \nNATHAN I shouldn't say this, but you're pretty, Gabrielle. It's unprofessional, I know. \nGABRIELLE Really? I always think myself so ugly. No, not ugly, but plain. A wallflower. \nNATHAN (buying her line) Really? No. Not at all. You're a very pretty girl. You should know that. You should be confident. \nGABRIELLE Thank you so much. Merci. It's very wonderful to hear a man say such a nice compliment. \nNATHAN It's true. I wouldn't lie. \nGABRIELLE You are sweet. \nGabrielle walks slowly by Nathan. He inhales deeply, breathing her in. She smiles to herself. He reaches out touches her leg. \nGABRIELLE (vaguely protesting) Doctor. \nShe moves into Nathan. She presses her thigh against his shoulder. Nathan leans forward, kisses her exposed thigh. \nNATHAN So soft. So smooth. (back to reality) I'm sorry. It's just... \nGABRIELLE (soothing) Shh. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nLila is shaving herself all over. Shaving and weeping. \nThere are nicks all over her body. She has no eyebrows any more. The hair on her head is hacked off. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAB - NIGHT \nNathan and Gabrielle are lying naked on the floor. \nGabrielle rests her head on Nathan's chest. \nNATHAN Was that okay? I mean, was I able to... satisfy you? \nLILA You are an animal. \nNATHAN Really? Wow! That's that's terrific to hear from someone so... feminine, so female. \nLILA I love being female because it, how do you say, allows me to be close to men. \nNATHAN I'm glad you're female. (beat) Do you think our boy witnessed the primal scene? \nGABRIELLE Anyway it's time he grew up. N'est- ce pa? (sighing, running her fingers along his chest) I love chest hair on a man. I know it isn't fashionable now, hairy men. But to me it is the very sign of masculinity. \nNathan tenses. Gabrielle looks up innocently at him. \nGABRIELLE What is wrong, my darling? \nNATHAN Nothing, my darling. All is right with the world. \nNathan talks. A tear runs down his face, mingles with the blood. \nNATHAN Funny. I still feel guilt. Even dead. One would've hoped... But alas. You know, I really did love Lila. But with her... problem... and then when Gabrielle revealed her feelings. And Gabrielle was so... conventionally female. And she had an accent. I was lost from that moment on. But Gabrielle was right. I couldn't admit it to myself, this shallowness of character, let alone to Lila. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nLila and Nathan eat. Lila is in her new, very feminine make- up, wig, and dress. Her table manners are impeccable, almost robotic. There is an awkward silence \nLILA Are you seeing somebody else, Nathan? I just have to know. \nNATHAN Of course not. \nLILA It would just be helpful to know. \nNATHAN No. \nLILA Because, you know, you seem so distant. And you work late every night. And we hardly ever have sex, and when we do, it's... I don't know. It feels different. \nNATHAN I'm just preoccupied. \nLILA Do you like my new look? \nNATHAN Yeah. It's nice. It's really good. \nLILA I'm trying, you know. (starting to cry) I'm trying to be what you want. I want to be what you want, Nathan. All I want is to be what you want. \nNATHAN (embarrassed) Shh. It's okay. (takes her hand) It's okay, Lila. You're what I want. You know that. You're exactly what I want. \nLILA (hopefully, sniffing) Really? \nNATHAN Sure. Of course. \nLILA Because I'm really trying, you know. Rosie says maybe only another two years of the elctrolysis. \nNATHAN (hard to stomach) That's great. \nLILA I've signed up for a ballet class. And look at my nails! A real girl! \nLila holds out her hands. Her finger nails are polished fire engine red. \nNATHAN That's great. It's a great color for you. \nLILA Oh, Nathan, let's have a baby! \nCUT TO: \nINT. NURSERY - DAY \nLila holds and rocks a swaddled baby. She passes it to Nathan, who looks at it and sees that it's a baby monkey. \nNathan shudders. Lila looks on lovingly, oblivious. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. THERAPIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nNathan sits with his head in his hands. Wendall listens attentively. \nNATHAN So anyway, that's the nightmare I've been having lately. \nWENDALL Do you suppose it has anything to do with Lila's unusually hairy body? \nNATHAN (beat) No, why? \nWENDALL Well, it seems that since Lila broached the subject of children, you've been on edge and I know you have an issue with the, uh, body hair. \nNATHAN (revelation) Oh, I see. Yes, that's something to think about. That's very good. That's what you get the big bucks, right? Ha ha. \nWENDALL I just think it might be important to explore your feelings for Lila. \nNATHAN I love Lila. I mean, she's a wonderful person. And... she loves me! That's no small potatoes. I mean she really loves me. She's sacrificed so much to be in this relationship with me. And she's a good person. A truly good person. How rare is that in this world, eh? And how could I stop loving somebody because of a little physical imperfection, if it can even be called that. I mean, God knows I'm not perfect! What about my eyesight? It's lousy, that's what! Lila's not going to leave me because of my eyesight. What about my penis? \nCUT TO: \nINT. LILA AND NATHAN'S - NIGHT \nLila, all prettied up and civilized and manicured, is setting the table for dinner. She is humming. Nathan walks in the door. Lila doesn't hear him. He stands in the doorway for a moment, watching Lila from behind. His face is blank. Lila catches sight of him. She's startled. \nLILA Oh! (laughs) I didn't see you there, sneaky boy! (runs over and kisses him) You're like a boy sneaking in... \nNATHAN (so bored) ...the back door of a movie theater. Yes, indeed. \nLILA You remember that from my book? I'm touched! (kisses him again) What's wrong? \nNATHAN Nothing. Hard day. Gonna have a drink. \nLILA I'll make it. (beats him to the portable bar) I'm so happy, Nathan! Everything's going to be so great! Scotch on the rocks, right? (giggles) Just kidding. I know what you drink, mister. I know what you drink. (pours and blends and shakes, etc.) Voila! \nLila hands Nathan a frothy pink concoction with a pineapple wedge sticking out of it. \nNATHAN Thanks. \nNathan stares contemplatively out the window and sips his drink. Lila watches him, comes up behind him, puts her arms around him. Nathan cringes, but tries to cover it. Lila feels the cringe, but pretends not to have. She keeps her arms around him for a moment longer, then casually removes them. \nLILA (fishing) How's work? \nNATHAN Cruddy, okay? Are you satisfied? \nLILA (pouty) No. I don't want your work to be cruddy. \nNATHAN My assistant quit today. Okay? He was highly valuable to the project. \nLILA Oh, baby. I'm sorry. Can't you hire somebody else? \nNATHAN I guess. \nLila screws up her face in concentration, trying to come with a viable solution to Nathan's problem. \nLILA Hey! I could come work for you! I know I haven't been all that supportive of this project, but I've come around. \nNATHAN Have you? \nLILA Oh yes, baby! I think that this is a wonderful project you're doing, taking this poor unfortunate, uncivilized creature and turning him into a human being! What a wonderful wonderful compassionate man you are! \nNATHAN Really? \nLILA Yes! And I want to help. You won't have to pay me, and I was thinking of giving up that crazy nature writing anyway. \nNATHAN How come? \nLILA Who needs it? I have you and I have being a woman and I have thinking about womanly things! I love being a woman because... \nNATHAN Such as what womanly things? \nLILA Such as my man and how to please him! (kisses him) Such as making wonderful dinners for my man! (kisses him again, leads him to the table, sits him down) Such as looking pretty for my man! (kisses him again) And I'm writing an article on quilting for the Ladies Home Journal! \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nLILA I had sold my fucking soul. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE SPACE - DAY \nNATHAN I let her sell her soul. I stood by as she did it. It's inexcusable. (beat) At the time though I thought it might help. \nCUT TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \nPUFF When she came to work with Nathan, she seemed different, gentlemen, I don't know, somehow soulless. \nCUT TO: \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREET - DAY \nLila, Nathan, and Puff walk along. Puff is astounded by everything he sees. He looks with wonderment at the tall buildings, the cars, the many different types of people. He looks like an idiot. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FANCY RESTAURANT - DAY \nPuff, Lila, and Nathan are eating lunch. Everything is very proper. Puff is doing wonderfully. \nNATHAN This is great, Puff. You're doing fine. \nPUFF I'm loving this. It's such a treat to be out and about. What a wonderful invention a city is. The immense buildings of glass and steel glinting in the afternoon sun, the smartly dressed women in their best summer frocks, the colorful street vendors. \nThe waitress comes by. \nWAITRESS How is everything? \nPUFF Just spectacular. Great salmon. Fantastico! You've got to give me the recipe! My compliments to the chef! \nWAITRESS I'm glad you... \nPuff stands and grabs her and starts humping her. \nNATHAN Puff, no! \nNathan presses a button on a small black box. Puff falls to the floor. The waitress looks on, sort of confused. \nWAITRESS And will that be all today? \nCUT TO: \nINT. TAXI - DAY \nLila, Nathan, and Puff are in the back seat of the moving taxi. \nPUFF It shan't happen again. I swear it. I'm just getting my sea legs, you know. \nLILA (patting Puff on the back) It's an animal urge, Puff. It's nothing to be ashamed of. \nNATHAN Lila! Tell him. \nLila looks at Nathan, amends her statement. \nLILA (to Puff) You just have to control it. We're not apes. \nNATHAN Thank you very much for that. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAB - DAY \nPuff is sitting in a chair and facing a screen. The collar is around his neck. Nathan and Lila stand behind him at a slide projector. \nPUFF I don't think this aversion therapy is really necessary, doctor. I understand the problem. \nNATHAN Humor me, Puff. It's essential that I am able to trust you to function independently in the world. \nPUFF I bow to your expertise in these matters. \nNATHAN Lila? \nLila dims the lights and switches on the projector. An image of a pretty, fully clothed woman appears on the screen. Puff's eyes widen, but he remains seated. \nNATHAN Good. You're doing fine. \nThe slide changes to a naked woman standing in a neutral position, no expression on her face. Puff twitches, but stays seated. \nNATHAN Excellent. \nThe slide changes to another photo of the same woman in the same position, but with a seductive smile on her face. Puff clutches the arms of the chairs. \nNATHAN I'm... I'm going to leave Lila. I can't stop thinking about you. \nGABRIELLE I've moved on. \nNATHAN No! \nGABRIELLE I've been seeing Johannsen in chemistry. \nNATHAN (raging) That goddamn Neanderthal? I'm the one who gave him the idea for the combination bug spray-sun screen! Did you know that?! \nGABRIELLE (calm, dismissive) That's not how he tells it. \nNATHAN Of course not, that Swedish thief! He's a thief of hearts! (beat) I love you, Gabrielle. \nGABRIELLE (dismissive) Hunh. \nNATHAN Just give me some time to let Lila down easily. She's a really nice girl and I don't want to hurt her more than is necessary. \nGABRIELLE (beat) You hurt me, you know, when you made Nathan's Choice. Does that not even matter to you, you pig? \nGabrielle cries quietly. Nathan moves closer to her. He strokes her hair. \nNATHAN Can you ever forgive me? \nGabrielle looks up at him. Her expression is noncommittal and pouty, but she grabs his arm and pulls him down on top of her. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STRIP CLUB - NIGHT \nPuff, dressed a bit like he's a Victorian dandy, sits in the front row and watches a naked woman on stage dancing. A topless cocktail waitress comes by with a fresh drink for him. She takes away his empty glass. He is horribly drunk and holding himself with exaggerated rigidity -- an amateur drinker's attempt to look sober. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LILA AND NATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNathan enters. Lila sits on the couch still reading. She looks up. \nNATHAN Hey. \nNathan kisses her on the forehead. \nLILA You were gone a long time. \nNATHAN (sits down next to her) Yeah. Puff and I got into a big, philosophical discussion. He's really quite well read, considering he's only been literate for a month now. He's going to make us famous, Lila. \nLILA So he's doing okay? \nNATHAN Seemed fine. Quiet evening enjoying his new digs. \nLILA That's funny because, you know, I just went and picked him up at some flophouse on the lower eastside. He called here when he ran out of his \"mad\" money after spending an entire evening drinking, watching strippers, and fucking a whore! (then casually) Oh, and what did you do tonight, honey? \nNATHAN Shit. \nLILA And what did you do tonight, honey? \nNATHAN I've fallen in love with somebody else, Lila. \nLILA (pointedly) And what did you do tonight, honey? \nNATHAN I fucked her! Okay? I fucked her. I'm sorry. But that's what the hell I did. \nLILA (standing) Do you know what I gave up to be with you? \nNATHAN Yes. \nLILA I gave up my soul, my beliefs. I gave up my body hair! \nNATHAN Yeah, well, I'm sorry. The human heart is a strange thing. \nLILA How the hell would you know anything about the human heart? \nNATHAN (moving to her) Lila... \nINT. LECTURE HALL - DAY \nA bearded psychologist addresses a crowd of bearded psychologists. \nBEARDED PSYCHOLOGIST ...and so without further ado, I give you Dr. Nathan Bronfman and Puff. \nThe room bursts into applause as Nathan and Puff walk out onstage, both in tuxes. Nathan stands behind a podium, Puff sits casually, legs crossed, in a chair. \nNATHAN Thank you. Let's get right to it. Here we have Puff the day of his capture. \nA video of Puff naked in his Lucite case, clawing at it, shrieking like a banshee, and neurotically hopping up and down, is projected onto a screen behind Nathan. There is a collective gasp from the audience. Puff watches the video with amused detachment. The video stops. \nNATHAN And here he is today, a scant three months later. \nPuff stands, bows slightly to the audience. They burst into vigorous applause. \nNATHAN Puff, why don't you say a few words to the assemblage. \nPUFF It would be my pleasure, doctor. (behind podium) Distinguished gentlemen and ladies of the psychological community, I stand before you today, a living testament to the amazing skill of Dr. Nathan Bronfman. To say that he took me from crayons to perfume would be a vast understatement. Dr. Bronfman took me from playing with my own feces, then to crayons, and then to an appreciation of the complex works of Franz Kline, Joseph Beuys, and Marcel Duchamp. From compulsive masturbation to... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. BACKSTAGE - A BIT LATER \nGabrielle waits in the wings. \nPUFF (O.S.) And, so, goodnight, adieu, until we meet again, au revoir. \nThe audience bursts into thunderous applause. Gabrielle joins in. Nathan and Puff hurry off stage. Gabrielle embraces Nathan. \nGABRIELLE You were wonderful! \nNATHAN Was I? I wasn't a tad stiff? \nGABRIELLE Don't be silly! (hugs Puff) And you were wonderful, too! I loved the way you said \" au revoir.\" \nPuff and Gabrielle exchange a look. She discreetly pinches Puff's butt, smiles, winks. Nathan doesn't see this. He puts his arm around Gabrielle. \nNATHAN Come on, you two. Let's go celebrate! \nNathan and Gabrielle walk on ahead. Puff tags behind, watching Gabrielle's delightful walk. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. HOTEL ROOM - LATER \nPuff sits up on his bed, looking dejected. He listens to the sounds of Nathan and Gabrielle having sex in the adjoining room. He looks at his watch, gets up, gets dressed. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. X RATED BOOKSTORE - LATER \nA sweaty, sick-looking Puff watches a porno film in a little booth. It ends. He steps out into the fluorescent glare of the store. He walks out past several skulking degenerates. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS \nPuff exits the bookstore, walks down the street checking out the tawdry hookers. He chooses one. She leads him into a dark alley. \nCUT TO: \nMONTAGE \n6) Lila in a Tai Chi class. \n7) Lila doing jumping jacks. \n8) Lila reading The Art of War. \n9) Lila doing stomach crunches. \n10) Lila doing chin ups. \nROSE Done! \nLILA (standing triumphantly) Ready! \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAB - DAY \nNathan and Gabrielle, in lab coats, sit chatting with Puff. \nPuff sneaks glances at Gabrielle's legs and cleavage. She makes his viewing possible. \nGABRIELLE (off clipboard) So we've got seventeen new bookings for speaking engagements, my wonderful men. \nNATHAN Terrific. We're all going to be rich and famous. \nNathan kisses Gabrielle. \nPUFF Thanks to you, Nate. \nNATHAN Thanks to you, Buddy. And your diligence and intelligence and perseverance. \nPuff blushes. \nNATHAN (to Gabrielle) And of course to you, my sweet, for your... moral support. \nPUFF (applauding) here, here. \nGabrielle kisses Nathan while glancing at Puff. A midget in a business suit enters. It's the sour-looking guy from the freak show. \nMIDGET Excuse me, are you Dr. Bronfman? \nPUFF Is that a little boy? \nNATHAN (teaching) No, Puff. This man is a midget. In actuality, they prefer to be called \"Little People.\" Isn't that correct, my good man? \nMIDGET Yes sir. Little People. \nNATHAN This Little Person is actually a fully grown adult man, Puff, believe it or not, who, due to a genetic anomaly, is miniature but perfectly proportioned. (to midget) Turn, please. \nThe midget turns. \nPUFF (jotting in notebook) Interesting. \nNATHAN Now, my diminutive friend, what can I do for you? \nThe midget pulls out a gun. \nMIDGET You can get into that goddamn Lucite bachelor pad for starters, Goliath. \nNathan, Gabrielle, and Puff look frightened. They stand and back into the case. \nMIDGET (to Puff) Not you, Joyboy. \nPuff stops in his tracks. Nathan and Gabrielle continue to back into the case. \nNATHAN What is this about? We have no money on these premises. Please if you are from some little person terrorist fringe group... \nMIDGET (loud and scary) Shut up! \nNathan and Gabrielle hurry into the case. The midget closes and locks the door behind them. Puff is frozen with fear. \nLila enters. She looks different now. Savage. Strong. \nKind of sexy. She wears guerilla-like black clothing and a beret over her closely hacked-off hair. She also carries a gun. \nNATHAN Lila? \nGABRIELLE That's Lila? \nLILA Shut up! Yeah, this is Lila, cunt. And don't let the hirsutism fool you. I know more about being a woman, and more about the black hearts of men than you, in your pretty little powdered, bullshit fantasy world, can ever imagine. I know the darkness and cruelty of nature, sweetie pie. \nNATHAN Lila, you don't intend to hurt us, do you? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - EVENING \nLila and Puff are driving in silence on a dirt road through the woods. Lila pulls off the road, drives to a place where the car will be camouflaged, and parks. \nLILA Stay. \nPuff stays in the car. Lila gets out, pulls the Lucite mouse case from the back seat. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS \nLila puts the case on the ground and unlatches it. The mice looks confused at first. Then the male mouse pushes the door open and holds it for the female mouse, who exits. The male mouse follows her, and closes the door behind him. He turns to Lila, nods, then extends his arm for the female mouse to hold on to. She does, and they walk off together on their hind legs into the woods. Lila sighs, and turns to Puff. \nLILA Out. \nPuff gets out casually, then makes a mad dash for the road. \nLila calmly presses the button on her black box. Puff spasms and falls to the ground. \nLILA Bad. \nPuff stays on the ground, breathing hard. \nLILA Get up. \nPuff does. \nLILA Take off your clothes. \nPuff does. So does Lila. She is covered with hair, except for her face. But whereas Puff is now white and soft-looking, Lila is tan and taut and muscular. This is a reversal of the way both of them were when they first met. \nPuff seems taken with her body. \nLILA We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it. \nPUFF But I like being human now. \nLila shocks Puff. He falls to the ground. \nLILA You what? \nPUFF I want to be the way I was before. \nLILA (sweet) Good. I'll show you how, apey. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WOODS - A BIT LATER \nPuff and Lila have built makeshift shelter out of leaves and twigs. They are sitting around a campfire, naked and dirty, roasting a couple of skinned squirrels on sticks. The black box rests in Lila's lap. Puff looks at the roasting squirrel, is repulsed. \nPUFF Nice night. \nLILA Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason. \nPuff begins to disagree. Lila's hand hovers over the button. He stops himself. \nPUFF (confused) I agree? \nLila shocks Puff. \nLILA You lose. Any answer is the wrong answer. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MAKESHIFT SHELTER - NIGHT \nPuff and Lila lie seperately under blankets of moss. The breathing is heavy. Both seem to be sleeping. Puff opens his eyes and tries to extricate himself from the moss without making any noise. Lila presses the button and Puff falls in a quivering mess. \nLILA (whisper) You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you. \nNATHAN I know. And that's great. But it would be great in a better way, not a better way but a different way, if I could find him and bring him back. \nGABRIELLE Where do we look for little lost Puff? \nNATHAN I have some thoughts. I think that hairy bitch is somewhere trying to turn him back into an ape. \nGABRIELLE That is horrible. Apes are dirty. No? \nNATHAN You better believe they're dirty! And smelly! And messy! And they don't know their forks from their assholes! \nNathan, seemingly in the grips of a sudden horrific migraine, scrunches his face and holds his ears. He relaxes a bit, and gets out of bed. He walks across the room, pulls on some pants, and picks up a container called \"Stop Buggin' Me, Sunny.\" \nNATHAN I'm going alone. This could be dangerous. \nGABRIELLE (pulling covers up and turning away from him onto her side) Okay, my sweet. Good night. \nNATHAN A little resistance would be nice, damn it. \nGABRIELLE (without opening her eyes) Please let me go with you. \nNATHAN No. \nGABRIELLE Okay. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. CAR - DAY \nNathan is driving along a wooded dirt road. He's in his immaculate safari suit. He looks tired. He stops the car, pulls out a gun, and gets out. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WOODS - CONTINUOUS \nNathan gets out of the car and runs into the woods. We follow. \nNATHAN (yelling) Aha! \nHe looks around there is no one there. He sighs and walks back to his car, pulls out a map and marks an area with a red X. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MOTEL - NIGHT \nNathan is in his underwear. He is ironing his safari suit as he talks on the phone. \nNATHAN No luck yet, my sweet. \nWe see an unfolded map on the bed. There are red X's in almost all the state parks along the east coast. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOREST - EVENING \nLila and puff are having sex again next to a campfire. Now Lila is wearing the collar, and Puff is giving her well timed shocks. They giggle and kiss after they finish. Puff sits up. He holds his stomach and grunts hungrily. Lila grunts back. She stands and retrieves a sack of berries. \nPuff and Lila greedily, gluttonously stuff their faces. \nLila takes some berries and smashes them against Puff's face. She laughs heartily. He looks annoyed for a second, but then grabs a handful and squishes them against Lila's face. Pretty soon they are having a berry war and are covered in purple stains. They hug each other, out of breath and laughing. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nLila smiles. \nLILA It was paradise. (beat, sadly) At least for a tiny little while. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nLila and Puff lie naked in a tree, lazily soaking up the midday sun. There is a rustling in the bushes. They both look up, alert but calm. Nathan, immaculate in his safari suit, appears in the clearing. He holds a gun. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE SPACE - DAY \nNathan talks. \nNATHAN Then Puff shot me. Then I died. That's all I know. That's the end of my story. Do I get to go to heaven now? (beat) Or is it... hell? (beat) Or... what? (beat) I just stay here, is it? I just stay here and tell it again? And after that? Again? And after... (sighs) Yes. Yes, of course. (sighs, clears his throat) \nWe move into an extreme close-up. \nNATHAN (beginning again) I don't even know what sorry means anymore. It's odd. When I was alive I knew -- maybe it was all I knew... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nLila runs to Nathan. She kneels beside him. \nLILA He's dead. \nPUFF (calmly) We bury the body. We disappear into the woods. Nobody knows. \nLILA (beat, then quietly) No. This is the end of the road. There's a dead human being here. For all of his faults, he was a human being, and certainly a victim of his culture as much as anybody. \nPUFF Forget him, Lila. We'll disappear. We'll never talk about it again. We'll never talk again period. I love you. \nLILA Puff, what happened to you is as much my fault as Nathan's. Maybe more so, because I knew it was wrong and I went along with it anyway. I'm taking responsibility for the murder. I want you to go back to your old life. \nPUFF I won't let you do that. I shot the bastard. And I'm glad. \nLILA No. Go back to the woods. This is a sacrifice I need to make. In my world we have something called penance. It's another abstraction, but I had the concept drummed into my head during my years in the convent. It doesn't exist for you, and it shouldn't. See, I could never be free again anyway, so I might as well be in jail. \nPUFF (beat) Then I'll live for both of us, Lila. I'll be the most free, truest animal in the whole forest. For both of us. \nLILA (tearing up) That's what I'm counting on. \nPUFF (an idea) But first I'll live among them, just long enough to testify before congress about the waywardness of humankind. \nLILA (shrugs) Okay. If you think it will help. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JAIL - DAY \nLila, now in prison coveralls, sits in a dayroom with other women convicts. She is watching a TV mounted on the wall. \nPuff is testifying. \nPUFF And so, gentlemen, that is my story. I agreed to testify before this committee because I hoped to convey to the American public that there is indeed a paradise lost. Human beings have become so enamored of their technologies and their intellectual prowess and their fancy gourmet foods, that they've forgotten to look to the Earth as a teacher. This is hubris, my friends. And my story of destruction and betrayal is proof of that. I will keep my promise to Lila. I will shed this suit and go back into the wilderness. I will live out my days naked and free. \nCONGRESSMAN Thank you, sir. Your story has touched us all deeply. We will pass some legislation addressing this problem. \nPUFF Thank you. That is all I ask. (to camera) Good-bye, Lila. I take you with me in my untamed heart. \nPuff stands and exits the auditorium. Flashbulbs flash. \nIn the prison common room, Lila wipes a tear from her eye. \nShe seems genuinely happy. She looks out a small barred window and sees a bluebird light there, then fly away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WASHINGTON STREET - DAY \nPuff walks along, a man on a mission. As he walks he sheds articles of clothing. He is followed by reporters and cameramen and celebrity hounds. Soon he is naked. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY \nPuff walks along, naked. People cheer from porches. \nCUT TO: \n", "test1_input": "The blowing hair driers whip the women's wet hair around their heads. The blowing hair drier drone is unbearably loud. \nLILA Then I became a famous nature writer. I said to myself, fuck humanity... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOOKSTORE WINDOW - DAY \nA big display of the book \"Fuck Humanity\" by Lila Jute. A long line of women with beautifully coiffured hair snakes out of the store. \nLILA ...and I became a recluse. I had a menagerie of animals at my house. They loved me because I was me. They loved me on the days I shaved. They loved me on the days I didn't. For a while this was enough. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. LOG HOUSE - DAY \nLila lies in bed tapping on a lap top. A dog lies with her and licks her knee. She seems to enjoy it, and gets lost in a reverie. The dog morphs into a handsome man, kissing her knee and working his way up her thigh and under her nightgown. Lila is getting seriously hot and bothered. Her head lolls. But the reverie dissipates and the man turns back into a dog rooting around her crotch with his cold nose. She pushes him away. The dejected dog gets off the bed. \nLILA (V.O.) By the time I was thirty I was very, very horny. \nLila gets out of bed and studies herself in the mirror. She brushes her hands against her hairy body. \nLILA I had to have a man in my... life. At any cost. I would become what I needed to become to achieve this. I would become a hairless lie. \nThe mirror image of Lila shimmers and turns into Lila with no body hair. Lila all made-up and with a smart new hairstyle. She assumes a coquettish pose and smiles cutely at herself. \nLILA I was rich enough for electrolysis by this time, so I began the long arduous process of having each inappropriate hair burned out of my body at the root. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nLila talks. One of the cops is doodling. One is picking wax from his ear with a pencil. One is reading a paperback novel under the table. \nLILA This is when everything changed, and this is where my confession really begins. \nThe cops look up. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELECTROLOGIST'S OFFICE - DAY \nLila lies shirtless on a table while Rose, her fifty year old electrologist, works on her back. \nROSE Progress! \nLILA Ouch. Yeah? \nROSE Oh yes, honey. Getting to be smooth smooth smooth all over. Smooth as a baby's butt. \nLILA I love it, Rose. I'm getting to be a real girl. \nROSE You still in the market for a real boy? \nLILA Always. Ow. \nROSE (beat) Cause there's this guy. My brother knows him. Might be right up your alley. \nLILA Tell me. I could use someone up my alley. \nROSE (playing dumb) I don't get that. Is that sexual? \nLILA Shut up and tell me. \nROSE Handsome, thirties, psychologist... \nLILA Loves animals? Ouch. Must love animals, Rose. \nROSE Loves animals. Loves you. \nLILA What do you mean? \nROSE Somehow it came up that you were a friend of mine. Mr. handsome, animal- loving psychologist said he would love to meet you. \n", "test1_true": "ROSE My brother is discreet. \nLILA (rubbing her hand over her jaw) Won't he be able to tell? \nROSE My brother says the guy's a thirty- five year old virgin, so maybe he won't know how women usually feel. Plus he's got bad eyesight, almost legally blind, which is helpful in this situation. Plus he's got an extremely small penis, of which he is \"mortifyingly ashamed\", so chances are he'll be so grateful for any non- judgmental attention, that he'll be yours forever. \nLILA God, he must be really close to your brother to tell him such personal stuff. \nROSE Yeah, well my brother is his shrink. \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nIt's a chi-chi place. Lila sits at a table with Nathan, fastidious in dress and manner. There is an awkward firstdate silence. She sneaks a glance at his crotch. Then: \nNATHAN Meditations on a Banana Slug was a delightful read. \nLILA Thank you so much. I love slugs. All slugs, not just banana slugs. \nNATHAN As do I. \nLILA They're so even keel. They forge ahead with slow determination. They don't get distracted or side-tracked. They don't care what they look like. They don't care that people look at them and go, \"Ewww. A slug.\" \nNATHAN They don't seem to be especially ego driven, this is true. \nLILA You've got to respect that. \nNATHAN I have to say that I'm not there yet. \nLILA Where? \nNATHAN Slugdom. Sluggishness. Whatever you'd call it. I'm not there yet. I still have many human characteristics. \nLILA That's not necessarily a bad thing. \nNATHAN Yes. I suppose not. But still. One would like to move along. To move beyond. \nLILA I'm not sure we can escape our natures. Believe me I've tried. I'm not even so sure anymore that we should want to. \nNATHAN I love that you said that. It makes me feel a bit lighter. I've been rather heavy lately. Thinking about my childhood. Realizing how much a product I am of my upbringing. (beat, cautiously) I've been seeing someone. A therapist. \nLILA (feigning surprise) You are a therapist, right? \nNATHAN No no. I'm a psychologist, but I do research. I'm a behaviorist. I work with animals. Mice at the moment. \nLILA I hope you don't perform any of those dreadful torture experiments, Nathan. \nNATHAN Heavens no. My work now is... Right now I'm teaching mice... well, table manners, to be candid. \nLILA (beat. doesn't know what to say) How's it going? \nNATHAN Quite well, really. It's a lot of work. A lot of reinforcement, mostly positive. Right now I've gotten two of my subjects to use napkins. Tiny napkins of course. \nLILA Paper or cloth? \nNATHAN I hope you don't think me daft. It's important work. It's part of a larger sociological experiment. I'm federally funded. \nLILA What's the larger experiment? \nNATHAN It's my thesis that if table manners can be taught to mice, they can be taught to humans. \nLILA Going out on a limb, aren't you, Nathan? \nNATHAN (speech) The truth is most people don't have table manners today. And when the foundations of civilized society crumble and disappear, civilized society in its entirely follows closely at its heels. \nLILA I'm not sure. \nNATHAN (stridently) Courtesy, decorum, manners, are all sadly lacking from our daily intercourse. Rudeness, vulgarity, meanness are the norm. \nLILA We are animals after all. \nNATHAN Ergo if I can teach table manners to mice, I can teach them to humans. If I can teach table manners to humans, I can save the world. \n", "test1_id": 3126, "test2_input": "LILA Like nothing. \nNathan smiles, relieved. Lila smiles back. Nathan recoils slightly, skittishly half-points to his bared teeth. \nApparently there's a piece of food stuck in Lila's teeth. \nShe closes her mouth, runs her tongue over her teeth, smiles again, mouth closed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELECTROLOGIST'S OFFICE -DAY \nRose is doing Lila's feet. \nROSE My brother says things are going really well between you and Nathan. \nLILA I cannot believe how in love I am with this man. \nROSE Yeah? \nLILA He's so cute. I even like his cute little penis. It's like a little pig's penis or something. (beat) Rose, we connect on every level. I've finally found someone I can feel completely safe with. \nROSE Don't throw that away. I had that once with a guy. But I threw it away for a cheap thrill. \nLILA One night stand? \nROSE No. I married a midget. \nLILA Marrying a midget was a cheap thrill? \nROSE Well he wasn't really a midget. He was on the cusp of midgethood. That's what made it cheap. Had he been an actual midget, there would've been nothing cheap about it, my dear. \nLILA I didn't know you were into that sort of thing. \nROSE Let me tell you, honey, midgets are the best kept secret in male companionship. They're portable. They're controllable. They're eager. And they're exactly the right height for a little covert oral fun on the dance floor. \nLILA (screams with delight, then:) I have a friend you might like to meet. \nROSE Oh? \nLILA Three foot one. \nROSE Be still my crotch. \nLILA Rose, Nathan's no midget, but he's asked me to move in with him. \nROSE Yeah. My brother told me. \nLILA And I think I'm going to. \nROSE (mulling it over) Stand on a stepladder sometimes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE SPACE - DAY \nNathan talks. \nNATHAN Lila moved in with me. Did I love her? I thought so. But from my new vantage point I realize that love is nothing more than a messy conglomeration of need, desperation, fear of death, insecurity about penis size, and the self-involved, ego driven need to collect other people's hearts. Not that I judge it. (puts head in hands. beat. looks up) Listen, I don't want to be dead yet. Is there any way to... \nNathan looks around for some sign of another person. There is nobody. \nNATHAN No I suppose not. (beat) No biggie. Anyway, Lila moved in. We had our problems, but we both wanted love so badly, we turned a blind eye. \nINT. NATHAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNathan, Lila, and Nathan's parents (looking very, very old) sit at the dining room table. Salad is about to be eaten, and everyone glances sideways over at Lila, waiting for her to make her move. She reaches for the wrong fork, corrects herself and picks the salad fork. Nathan breathes a sigh of relief. His mother looks disappointed, clucks. They eat in silence. Finally: \nLILA It's lovely to finally meet you, Mr. and Mrs. Bronfman. I've heard so much about you and I've seen you in photographs from Nathan's childhood, but it's nice to meet you in the flesh. I must say, you look exactly the same as in the photographs. \nMOTHER Thank you, dear. \nNATHAN Actually, Mother and Father, you look very, very old. You look terrible. \n", "test2_true": "His mother and father touch their faces reflexively, then look at each other and laugh. \nMOTHER Tell him, Harold. \nFATHER Son, your mother and I are doing a production of The Gin Game at the local community theater. We forgot to take off our make-up. \nThe mother and father laugh again. Then they pull at their latex faces. The wrinkles come off. And they look exactly as they did in the flashback scene, albeit a bit pink-faced. \nThere is another pause. \nLILA (awkward) Goodness, you two look exactly as you did in those old photos. \nMOTHER (cold) Yes, so you mentioned earlier, dear. \nNATHAN (changing the subject) Lila's a nature writer, mother. \nMOTHER I love nature. As long as it stays in the zoo where it belongs. \nThe father and Nathan laugh at mother's joke. Lila joins in weakly, against her better judgment. \nMOTHER (to Lila) Don't you agree, dear? \nLila hesitates. \nNATHAN Of course she does, mother. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NATHAN AND LILA'S BEDROOM - LATER \nNathan is in bed, in starched pajamas. He lies on his back under perfect covers and stares straight up at the ceiling. \nNATHAN What are you doing in there? \nLILA (O.S.) (pissy) I'll be out in a minute. \nNATHAN I'm sorry about my parents. \nLILA (O.S.) You didn't seem sorry when you were laughing at all your mother's stupid, tasteless, cruel animal jokes. \nNATHAN I was simply attempting to keep the evening light. You know that I feel similarly to you about nature. \nLILA (O.S.) Do you? \nNATHAN Of course. (beat) I simply love the... naturalness of it all. \nLila emerges from the bathroom, radiant, hopeful. \nLILA Do you? Oh do you, darling? \nNATHAN Why certainly! \nLila happily leaps into bed. She smothers Nathan with kisses. \nLILA Oh, darling. I'm so relieved. Let's celebrate with a long hike in the woods tomorrow! \nNATHAN (oh shit) That's a great idea. \nNathan kisses her. \nLILA It'll be wonderful! I'll show you my old stomping grounds! \nNATHAN Terrific. Can't wait! \nNathan kisses her ear. He looks confused, sticks his finger behind her ear, and pulls it out with a dab of shaving cream on it. \nNATHAN Shaving cream? \nLILA I don't think so. (beat) Why? \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - MORNING \n", "test2_id": 3127, "test3_input": "It has been transformed into a bachelor pad. Inside is a king-size bed, a TV, a couch, coffee table, shelves lined with books, a small kitchenette. There is a curtain which can be drawn for privacy. Puff is taken aback. \nNATHAN AND LILA Surprise! \nPuff gasps and runs into the room. He is thrilled. Nathan holds up a key. \nNATHAN Free to come and go as you please. There's some \"mad money\" in the night table drawer. \nPUFF (taking the key, hugging Nathan) It's wonderful! Do you think I'm ready? Do you really? \nNATHAN I trust that you'll make good, mature decisions. I trust that you'll do the proper thing. \nPUFF Oh, I will! (gravely) Your very trust has instilled an enormous sense of responsibility in me. I don't want to disappoint you. \nNATHAN Good. Remember, when in doubt: Don't ever do what you really want to do. \nPUFF (taking it in) Got it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LILA AND NATHAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nLila and Nathan sit as far as possible from each other and read books. Nathan looks at his watch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PUFF'S CASE - NIGHT \nPuff, dressed identically to Nathan, reads Moby Dick and smokes a pipe. He distractedly taps his foot, stands and studies a Monet print on the wall. His foot is still nervously tapping. He checks his watch. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LILA AND NATHAN'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nNathan stands. \nNATHAN I'm going to go down and check on Puff. See how he's holding up. \nLILA (stretching) Should I come with? \nNATHAN Nah. You just relax. How's the book? \nLILA (lazily, happily) Ummm. It's good. \nNathan kisses Lila on the forehead. \nNATHAN I won't be long. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - NIGHT \nNathan drives with a determined look on his face. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GABRIELLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe apartment is a mess. Every single light is on. \nGabrielle is lounging in a stained nightshirt with a dopey cartoon bear on the front. She's got some sort of pimple medication dabbed on her face. She unconsciously but ferociously bites her nails as she watches TV and talks on the phone. There is no trace of a French accent. \nGABRIELLE (into phone) You're kidding! Holy shit. (beat) Yeah, no duh! I had a wild hair up my ass over that for a month. \nThere's a knock at the door. \nGABRIELLE Yeah? What? \nNATHAN (O.S.) Hi. It's Nathan. \nGabrielle's eyes widen. She jumps up from the couch and starts straightening. \nGABRIELLE (into phone) Call you back. (hangs up, assumes French accent) You bastard! What do you want? \n", "test3_true": "GABRIELLE (ripping off her nightshirt) We have nothing to say! You are a rotten bastard, that's what! \nCUT TO: \nINT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nNathan stands there leaning against the door. \nNATHAN Please. Just one minute of your time. \nGABRIELLE (O.S.) Why? You've made your decision, Mister Stinky American! Now I hate you! No, I don't hate you; I don't even think about you! \nNATHAN I've got some things to tell you. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GABRIELLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nGabrielle is standing in front of a mirror, holding different sexy outfits up to herself, trying to decide. \nGABRIELLE Like what? \nNATHAN (O.S.) Well, I think it would be easier if I could talk to you in person. \nGABRIELLE What for? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nWe hear banging and rustling and arranging coming from inside the apartment. \nNATHAN Well, I think... \nGABRIELLE (O.S.) You think too much. I need a man who doesn't think so much but acts more than he thinks... is what I need! \nNATHAN What? \nGABRIELLE You heard me! You make me sick when you pretend to not understand what I am saying to you! Go away from here! \nNATHAN (turning away) Well, look, I'm sorry to have bothered you. \nHe starts to head down the hall. \nGABRIELLE (O.S.) (beat, then screaming) All right, already! Come in if you must! The door's open, you son of a bitch! \nNathan heads back to the apartment, tries the knob. The door's open. He enters. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GABRIELLE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nThe lights are low. The place is neat. Cool jazz plays quietly in the background. Candles are lit. Gabrielle is nowhere to be found. Nathan takes it all in. It's quite seductive. \nGABRIELLE (O.S.) In here, you lousy piece of merde. \nNathan follows her voice. He exits into the bedroom. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GABRIELLE'S BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS \nCandles in here also. Gabrielle, now made up and in a satin teddy, lounges in bed, eating cherries from a bowl. Nathan just stares. She is slightly out of breath, but trying to conceal it. A film of perspiration glistens on her brow. \nGABRIELLE (testy) Well? \nNATHAN God, you're beautiful. \nGABRIELLE Please. I look a mess. \nNATHAN No. You look so beautiful. \nGABRIELLE Anyway. Come already to the point. \n", "test3_id": 3128}

{"test1_input": "\"HUMAN NATURE\" \nby \nCharlie Kaufman \nMay 20, 1995 \nFIRST DRAFT \nBLACKNESS. \nThere is a gunshot. A crow screams. A fluttering of wings. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nBird's-eye view. We circle lazily above the forest. \nThrough a break in the trees, we catch an occasional glimpse of a prostrate form on the ground. As the circling camera gets closer we see that the form is a human body. \nCUT TO: \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP OF LILA TALKING TO THE CAMERA \nLILA I'm not sorry. \nA bead of sweat trickles down her cheek. Then: a blinding flash of light obliterates her face. \nCUT TO: \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP OF PUFF TALKING TO THE CAMERA \nPUFF I am sorry. \nA tear wells in Puff's eye and runs down his face. Another blinding flash of light. \nCUT TO: \nEXTREME CLOSE-UP OF NATHAN TALKING TO THE CAMERA \nNATHAN I don't even know what sorry means anymore. \nAs Nathan speaks, a trickle of blood drips down his face from his out-of-frame forehead. Another blinding flash of light. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nIt's a frenetic hand-held shot as Lila is pulled from a police car and dragged into the precinct house. Cameras flash. Reporters shout questions. Lila attempts to shield her face from view, but she is handcuffed and can only manage to hunch her shoulders. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nA ratty interrogation room. Institutional green walls. \nBeat-up file cabinets. Dark. A bit of fluorescent light spills in through the frosted glass door. Lila, thirties, sits at the end of a long table. A reel-to-reel tape recorder whirs in front of her. She is smoking. Three fat, mean-looking cops sit in shadows at the other end of the table. One of the cops eyes her lasciviously. Lila's hand shakes as she brings the cigarette to her mouth. \nLILA I'm not sorry. So I spend the rest of my life in jail. So what? I've been in jail my whole life anyway. A jail of blood and tissue and coursing hormones... \nOne of the cops sighs and massages the bridge of his nose. \nIt's going to be a long night. \nLILA ...a jail called the human body. \nThe lascivious cop smiles lasciviously at Lila's reference to \"human body.\" \nLILA My soul held prisoner in this reeking, stench-ridden bag of bones and entrails. A bag of feces and piss and fibroid cysts in my tits and precancerous moles on my sun-damaged back... \nThe lascivious cop gags, then vomits on the floor. Lila drags on her cigarette, calmer now. \n", "test1_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \nPuff, thirties, dirty, scraggly hair and beard but in a crisp business suit, testifies before a congressional committee. The auditorium is filled with reporters and spectators. Puff sits in front of a microphone, counsel at his side. He pours himself a glass of water, drinks, clears his throat, then speaks: stentorian, confident. \nPUFF I am sorry, gentlemen, sorry for all of us. Your's is a complicated, sad world. \nThis is a revelation to the assembled crowd. People whisper to each other. \nPUFF And I never knew that. I was living a life of simplicity, of purity, when I was ripped out of my Eden and immersed in this harshness. Some would argue that the life I was living was not a human life at all. And, gentlemen, I don't have any clever retort. I am not a philosopher. The only thing I know is that I am sorry, sorry for my expulsion from Eden, sorry for my Lila rotting in her jail cell, and sorry for Nathan... rotting in his grave. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WHITE SPACE - DAY \nNathan, thirties, in a white robe, sits alone at a white table. Everything is white except for an oozing bullet wound in Nathan's temple. \nNATHAN I don't even know what sorry means anymore. It's odd. When I was alive I knew -- maybe it was all I knew -- but here sorry is meaningless. Love is meaningless. Jealousy is meaningless. Ambition is meaningless. Everything that motivated my every breath while I was alive is meaningless now. (beat) I guess that's how I can be sure I'm really dead. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \nLila watches the slowly churning tape recorder reels, fixated. The cop who vomited is mopping it up. The other two are sipping coffee. Lila talks. \nLILA My story begins when I was twelve. \nCOP (checks watch) Jesus. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY \nIt's got that faded, \"memory\" look. Twelve year old Lila hurries home from school, books clutched to her chest. \nOther kids walk along the street in pairs or groups, laughing and chatting. Lila walks alone, a worried scowl on her face. \nLILA (V.O.) Something terrible happened when I was twelve. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LITTLE GIRL'S ROOM - DAY \nColors are still muted. It looks to be somewhere in the early 70's based on the preponderance of Bay City Rollers posters on the wall. Twelve year old Lila enters the room, closes the door, locks it, rattles the doorknob to make sure that the door is really locked. She draws the shades. She pulls some t-shirts from her dresser drawer and stuffs them into the space between the bottom of the door and the floor. \nKID BROTHER (O.S.) (muffled) Hey, no fair! \nTWELVE YEAR OLD LILA Drop dead, Eric. \nLila stands nervously in front of the full-length mirror on her closet door. She takes a deep breath and begins to unbutton her shirt, watching herself carefully in the mirror. \nADULT LILA (V.O.) Something terrible started to happen to my body when I was twelve. My mother said because of it I would never be able to get a man, so I should get used to the idea of dedicating my life to the pursuit of knowledge, or religion... or whatever. \nLila's shirt is now unbuttoned. She pulls it open. She is wearing a training bra over the very beginning of breast buds. On the chest above the bra, and on her stomach below it, is hair. Dark curly hair. She stares at it, touches it cautiously. Then she starts to cry. She crouches into a ball and weeps. \nADULT LILA (V.O.) The doctor said... \nCUT TO: \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY \nOld fashioned office. Twelve year old Lila sits on the examination table, her shirt off. An elderly male doctor touches the hair, fingers it. Her mother looks on. \nDOCTOR (to the mother) It's hormonal. Nature is a funny and complex thing. It could get worse with time. \nYoung Lila turns to the camera. \nTWELVE YEAR OLD LILA By the time I was twenty I looked like an ape. \nCUT TO: \nINT. POLICE STATION - NIGHT \n", "test1_id": 3126, "test2_input": "NATHAN You'll catch cold. It's cold. (beat) What do you suppose he is, a survivalist? \nLILA I think he's feral. \nNATHAN (jumping back) Feral? Don't touch him! He might be diseased! He might... My God, rabies! \nLILA He looks perfectly fine. \nNATHAN I think we should go. Please. Before he wakes up and, I don't know, eats us, or whatever feral things do. \nLILA I don't understand you. This is fascinating and you just want to run away. I mean, here we have a human being totally uncontaminated by civilization, totally free, and all you want to do is run back to your... \nNATHAN (thinking) Actually, I just had an amusing thought. \nLILA What? \nNATHAN (musing) Feral, huh? Totally uncontaminated? \nLILA Look at him. He doesn't understand English. He moves like an animal. \nNATHAN It's perfect! \nLILA Nathan, what the hell are you talking about? \nNATHAN (doing a little dance) Forget mice! Actually forget guinea pigs, cats, monkeys, and chimps also. I'm on to stage five: The human subject. \nLILA Oh no. You can't take him from his home, Nathan. \nNATHAN (ranting) Don't you see? He's my Tabula Rasa, my Eliza Dolittle. He's my ticket to the top of the Behaviorist food chain. He's going to make me famous. \nLILA I won't allow you. It's wrong. He's happy here. \nNATHAN Is he, Lila? Is he happy living filthy and naked alone in this tick infested wilderness? Never to know the love of a good woman, never to revel in the pitter-patter of little feet, never to read Moby Dick, or marvel at a Monet, or just sit back after a day of hard but rewarding work, smoke a pipe, and wonder about the nature of reality. \nLILA (weakening resolve) You'd be taking away his freedom, Nathan. \nNATHAN Freedom's just another word for nothing left to lose, Lila, to quote Janet Jackson. \nLila looks off into the distance, her eyes brimming with tears. As Nathan continues his speech, we move closer and closer into Lila's eyes. Nathan's voice fades into nothing by the time we dissolve. \nNATHAN Belonging to something, a person or a society, is a basic human craving. We are communal creatures. This poor soul has no one, nothing... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. CLIFF - SUNSET \nA naked, very hairy Lila sits by herself on the cliff and watches the sunset. There's a chill in the air and she shivers and hugs herself. \nLILA Oh God, I have no one. Nothing. You give me this beautiful gift, this glorious sunset. But with no one to say \"isn't that a beautiful sunset\" to, it becomes meaningless, just another stupid sunset. They happen everyday. So what? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. FOREST - DAY \nLila is hovering over the unconscious Puff. Nathan's voice comes back into focus. He is still speechifying. \nNATHAN ...what is it that makes us human, if not the knowledge that we are indeed human? Think of this poor soul's education as the greatest gift we could bestow upon... \nLILA All right. \nNATHAN Great. Grab his feet. We'll throw him in the trunk. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAB - DAY \nNathan hovers over the Lucite case with the tiny dinner table in it. His assistant, Gabrielle, presses a button, a door opens, and two white mice scurry in. The male pulls out a chair for the female. The female climbs up on the chair, and the male pushes the chair in, then scurries around to the other side of the table and climbs onto his own chair. The Lucite lid over the silverware and salads lifts and both mice pick up the proper forks and begin eating. Nathan scribbles in his notebook. \nGABRIELLE Doctor... \nNathan looks up. Gabrielle jerks her head in the direction of a very large Lucite case. Inside, Puff, now dressed in a diaper and connected to all sorts of electrodes, is stirring. Nathan and Gabrielle hurry over. \nNATHAN Good morning. \n", "test2_true": "He tries to escape. Not understanding Lucite, he smashes into it, again and again. He tears at his diaper. Nathan gives a nod to Gabrielle, who presses a button on a panel. \nAn electric shock sends Puff flying. He lies on the floor confused and dazed. After a moment, he gets up and again crashes into the Lucite. Nathan gives the signal to Gabrielle and once again she shocks Puff. He once again gets up and crashes against the Lucite. Again he is shocked. He gets up again, and is about to crash against the Lucite, but he thinks better of it, and squats in place, immobilized. \nNATHAN (to Gabrielle) Only three shocks. A chimp takes fifteen. This is going to be tres simple, no, Gabrielle? \nGABRIELLE (in love with Nathan) Oui, doctor, oui. \nNATHAN (to Puff) Good morning... (to Gabrielle) We need a name for him, don't we? \nGABRIELLE Oui. \nNATHAN You decide. Today is your day. \nGABRIELLE Really? My day? Well, I had a sweet little mongrel puppie named Puff when I was a girl. This one reminds me of my dog, all shaggy! So cute! (giggles girlishly) I loved my doggie very much, monsieur. \nNATHAN (charmed) Puff it is then. Puff Bronfman. Is that okay? \nGABRIELLE Oui. Perfect! \nNATHAN (to Puff) Good morning, Puff Bronfman. I'm Dr. Bronfman and this is my assistant Gabrielle. We're your mommy and daddy while you are here. \nGabrielle likes this concept a great deal. She smiles and moves closer to Nathan. \nNATHAN (to Puff) How about some salad, son? \nGabrielle poises her finger above the button. She winks at Nathan. He blushes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARKING LOT - EVENING \nNathan, carrying a brief case, is walking to his car. \nGabrielle hurries to catch up to him. Her high heels click on the pavement. \nGABRIELLE Dr. Bronfman! Dr. Bronfman! \nNathan turns. \nNATHAN Oh, Hi, Gabrielle. \nGABRIELLE (out of breath) Hi. I just wanted to tell you that I very much enjoy working with you. (blushes) Now I'm embarrassed that I say this. \nThey walk along. \nNATHAN No. Don't be. I really enjoy hearing that. You're a terrific assistant. \nGABRIELLE Merci. I... Do you... would you like to go get a cup of coffee, perhaps? \nNATHAN Well, I don't know. I'm actually on my way to... \nGABRIELLE Now I am truly embarrassed. Forgive me. I should not have asked such a stupid question. I know you are a very important man and... \nNATHAN No. Don't be silly. It's just... \nGABRIELLE I am a foolish little thing. I am pink in my face, no? It is only that I have been so lonely lately and... I am ashamed. I'll see you tomorrow, okay? Unless... Am I fired now? \nGabrielle pouts. Nathan is charmed. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - EVENING \nNathan and Gabrielle sit at a romantic little table in a trendy coffee shop. \nGABRIELLE Thank you so much for accompanying me. \nNATHAN Not at all. \nGABRIELLE I have had such a difficult time in my personal life and you seem to be such a nice man... but I'm talking too much again, no? \nNATHAN Of course not. \n", "test2_id": 3127, "test3_input": "CUT TO: \nINT. CAR - EVENING \nLila and Puff are driving in silence on a dirt road through the woods. Lila pulls off the road, drives to a place where the car will be camouflaged, and parks. \nLILA Stay. \nPuff stays in the car. Lila gets out, pulls the Lucite mouse case from the back seat. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CAR - CONTINUOUS \nLila puts the case on the ground and unlatches it. The mice looks confused at first. Then the male mouse pushes the door open and holds it for the female mouse, who exits. The male mouse follows her, and closes the door behind him. He turns to Lila, nods, then extends his arm for the female mouse to hold on to. She does, and they walk off together on their hind legs into the woods. Lila sighs, and turns to Puff. \nLILA Out. \nPuff gets out casually, then makes a mad dash for the road. \nLila calmly presses the button on her black box. Puff spasms and falls to the ground. \nLILA Bad. \nPuff stays on the ground, breathing hard. \nLILA Get up. \nPuff does. \nLILA Take off your clothes. \nPuff does. So does Lila. She is covered with hair, except for her face. But whereas Puff is now white and soft-looking, Lila is tan and taut and muscular. This is a reversal of the way both of them were when they first met. \nPuff seems taken with her body. \nLILA We're going back to nature, you and I. I'm going to retrain you. I'm going to make you free again if I have to kill you doing it. \nPUFF But I like being human now. \nLila shocks Puff. He falls to the ground. \nLILA You what? \nPUFF I want to be the way I was before. \nLILA (sweet) Good. I'll show you how, apey. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WOODS - A BIT LATER \nPuff and Lila have built makeshift shelter out of leaves and twigs. They are sitting around a campfire, naked and dirty, roasting a couple of skinned squirrels on sticks. The black box rests in Lila's lap. Puff looks at the roasting squirrel, is repulsed. \nPUFF Nice night. \nLILA Talking is to be kept to a minimum. Eventually, when we are ready, there will be none. Language was invented so that people could lie to each other and to themselves. There is no other reason. \nPuff begins to disagree. Lila's hand hovers over the button. He stops himself. \nPUFF (confused) I agree? \nLila shocks Puff. \nLILA You lose. Any answer is the wrong answer. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MAKESHIFT SHELTER - NIGHT \nPuff and Lila lie seperately under blankets of moss. The breathing is heavy. Both seem to be sleeping. Puff opens his eyes and tries to extricate himself from the moss without making any noise. Lila presses the button and Puff falls in a quivering mess. \nLILA (whisper) You'll thank me eventually, Puff. Well, you won't thank me, because we won't be speaking, but you'll sort of thank me with a special look, the look a dog gives you to let you know he loves you. \n", "test3_true": "Lila shocks Puff once again. As he spasms, we: \nCUT TO: \nINT. AUDITORIUM - DAY \nPuff testifies. \nPUFF And so commenced my reeducation, gentlemen. Lila taught me so much. She was a stern but fair teacher. And over time, I began to remember the carefree joy of living in a pure state of being. But something else happened as well, something perhaps distinctly human... I began to fall in love with Lila. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. WOODS - DAY \nLila and Puff are naked and collecting mushrooms and berries. Time has passed. Both Lila and Puff are dirtier and hairier. Puff still wears his collar. Lila bends over to pick a mushroom. Puff looks at her from behind. \nPUFF Boy, you look so good from this ang... \nLila turns, puts her finger to her lips in a gentle \"no talking\" reminder, then shocks the hell out of Puff. He spasms and falls on top of her, knocking her to the ground. \nHe regains his composure, finds himself on top of Lila. \nThey look at each other for a moment. Then they kiss. It's a violent kiss. They grope each other. This is primal sex now. In the dirt. Sweaty. Loud grunting. Lila even presses the shock button at the right moment. Puff seems to like it in this context. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GABRIELLE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nNathan and Gabrielle are in bed, making love. It is gentle, romantic, in good taste -- in direct contrast to the animal, violent sex Puff and Lila are having. They finish. Nathan pulls himself off of Gabrielle and falls onto his back, staring up at the ceiling. \nGABRIELLE A penny for your thoughts, mon cheri. \nNATHAN I don't know. Something's missing. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nGabrielle, Nathan, and Nathan's parents eat dinner. \nNathan's parents are in clown make-up. There is a long silence. Nathan is still sad. Gabrielle steals glances at Nathan's parents. Finally Nathan speaks. \nNATHAN (uninterested) So, Mother and Father, how's Godspell going? \nMOTHER How did you know we... \nThe parents look at each other burst out laughing. \nMOTHER Tell him, Harold. \nFATHER It's going famously, son, famously! \nNATHAN (despondent) I'm glad. \nMOTHER Harold, ask Nathan what's wrong. \nGABRIELLE Yes, please, somebody ask him what is wrong. \nNATHAN I don't know. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNathan and Gabrielle are in bed. Nathan stares up at the ceiling. Finally: \nNATHAN I want our boy back. \nGABRIELLE (sadly) Oui. \nNATHAN That bitch. I worked so hard. We worked so hard, you and I. He would've made us famous. \nGABRIELLE We still have you and I. \n", "test3_id": 3128}

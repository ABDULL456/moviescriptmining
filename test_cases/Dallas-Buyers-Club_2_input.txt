Ron sits behind a table when a MAN in a suit walks in.   He takes off his jacket and sits. Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 32A 
RICHARD BARKLEY I'm Richard Barkley from the Food and Drug Administration office. 
Ron nods.   A beat. 
RICHARD BARKLEY You're a priest? Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 33 
Ron smiles.   The customs agent doesn't. 
RICHARD BARKLEY You have over 2,000 pills here. You are only allowed to bring in a ninety day supply. 
RON Well as I told the gentlemen, I am a sick man. I have cancer. I take 22 pills a day and these here vials of Vitamin A, C, E and Zinc. That there is ninety days. 
The man looks at Ron, not really buying it. He takes a bottle of Peptide T and looks at it. 
RICHARD BARKLEY Vitamins? (no answer from Ron) You do realize that importing unapproved drugs for sale is a very serious offense? 
RON Well, as I said, they're not for sale. And they ain't illegal, just "unapproved." 
A long beat; they stare at each other. 
RICHARD BARKLEY If we find the slightest indication that you're selling these drugs for profit, you will be thrown in jail... Father. 
RON Then I promise to take each and every one of them pills myself. In fact this present detainment has already put me off schedule... Son. 
50A   INT. DALLAS MERCY HOSPITAL - RECEPTION DESK - DAY               50A 
Ron talks to Nurse Frazin. 
RON I'm looking for Dr. Eve Saks. 
NURSE FRAZIN She's not here today. 
Nurse Frazin leaves. Ron looks over the counter, sees something, looks around... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 33A 
51   INT. EVE'S HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - DALLAS - NIGHT                51 
Perfectly ordered and spotless except for files and reports piled on the floor. An exhausted Eve takes her lab coat off, picks up a study and aims for the kitchen when a KNOCK comes at the door. 
EVE It's open! 
Ron comes in. 
EVE Mr. Woodroof... Ron, I thought you were... Dallas Buyers Club / Green Revision / Dec 2, 2012 / P. 34 
RON (cutting her off) Dead? Sorry for bargin' in. 
EVE What are you doing here?   You look great. 
RON Actually I look amazin'.   But you, you look like shit. 
EVE What happened to you? 
RON So you got any music?   Or crackers? 
EVE I'm sorry, but what is this? 
RON It's a celebration of how absolutely fuckin' wrong you were. 
Ron holds up a bottle of sparkling wine. 
EVE Excuse me? 
RON Thirty days you said! Well here it is months later and I'm goin' like gangbusters. Now if that don't call for a little Cheez Whiz on a Ritz, I don't know what does! 
Ron heads for the refrigerator. 
EVE No.   Don't... I don't really eat here. 
The DOORBELL interrupts them. Ron watches as Eve crosses and opens the door, admitting Rayon, looking like shit and shaking badly in a full-length, pink fur coat.

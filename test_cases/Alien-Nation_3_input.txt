DETECTIVE I don't know about the rest of you, but I sure as hell ain't gonna sit still for this.  I'm calling the union, pronto. 
Others grumble.  "Yeah!".  Meanwhile, Sykes has decided something.  He heads toward Warner's office.  Fedorchuk sees this. 
FEDORCHUK Where the hell is he going? 
INT.  WARNER'S OFFICE - DAY 
Sykes KNOCKS and enters. 
WARNER Yeah, Sykes? 
SYKES Captain.  I'd like to volunteer for duty with the new detective. 
Warner is surprised.  He never expected Sykes. 
WARNER ... All right.  Detective Sergeant Sykes, this is Detective... Jetson. 
JETSON We have met. 
Warner looks up, clocking this.  He looks at Sykes, starting to smell something fishy. 
The balding man, GOLDRUP, rises to shake their hands. 
GOLDRUP Victor Goldrup, Mayor's office. Congratulations, gentlemen. 
Warner is starting to suspect what Sykes is up to. 
WARNER (to Sykes) You are to have nothing to do with the investigation into Bill Tuggle's death.  You know that.  Leave that for Fedorchuk. 
SYKES (nodding) Departmental policy. 
WARNER (to Jetson) You? 
JETSON Yes, sir. 
WARNER Good. 
SYKES There's another case I'd like to take.  A homicide -- a Newcomer named Hubley. 
Jetson looks over at Sykes, knows he's up to something. Sykes avoids his look. 
WARNER Granger and Pitts are already on it. 
SYKES Granger and Pitts have one hell of a caseload... and I would have thought with Jetson here being the first Newcomer plainclothes, and Hubley's body being found over in the Newcomer community... 
WARNER Don't tell me what to think. 
GOLDRUP He's got a point.  That's the sort of thing we should be doing with this early advancement program... 
Long-suffering Warner looks up at Goldrup, then finally sighs with resignation.  Sykes grins. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  STAIRWELL - FIRST FLOOR HALLWAY - DAY 
The steel door BANGS open and Sykes and Jetson exit.  Next to Sykes' slept-in look, Jetson in his grey suit looks like a Jehovah's Witness canvasser.  They move past all the black-and-whites pulling out on p.m. watch during: 
SYKES ... and we work my hours.  I'll do the driving, you do the paperwork. You gotta learn it so you might as well do it all. 
JETSON (after a moment) Sergeant... I'd like to thank you for what you're doing. 
SYKES What's that? (then realizing) Look, Jetson.  Get this straight in your head.  We're not pals, we're not married, and we ain't gonna take long moonlight walks together... We're just partners.  And don't call me Sergeant.  Call me Sykes... or Matt if you have to. 
JETSON I am George. 
Sykes nods absently, and they walk on... four and a half steps to be exact.  Then it hits Sykes.  He seizes up cold. 
SYKES Wait a minute.  George?  George Jetson? 
Jetson nods... he's used to this. Sykes cracks up.

CRASH I was in the Show for 21 days, once. (beat) It was the greatest 21 days of my life. You never touch your luggage in the show -- somebody else handles your bags. It's great. (beat) The ballparks are like cathedrals, the hotels all have room service, the women have long legs and brains -- it's a smorgasbord. 
DEKE The women are hot, eh? 
CRASH Yeah -- and so are the pitchers. They throw ungodly breaking stuff in the Show -- exploding sliders. 
Nuke, Tony, and Deke murmur in awe at Crash's pronouncement. 
CRASH You could be one of those guys -- but you don't give a fuck, Meat. 
NUKE God damn it I'm sick of you calling me "Meat"! You wanta step outside! 
CRASH HOPS TO HIS FEET as the bus barrels along, grabbing Nuke by the collar. 
CRASH Yeah, let's go. 
Nuke quickly has second thoughts -- Crash can be terrifying. 
NUKE No. Wait a minute. Calm down, Crash... 
Nuke sits back down. Calms. Reaches for a baseball sitting nearby. He hands the ball to Crash. 
NUKE Teach me how to throw a breaking ball. 
Crash takes the ball gently and speaks softly: 
CRASH As I was saying ya hold it like an egg. 
As the bus rolls through the country: 
A LATE 60'S OLDS CONVERTIBLE ROARS PAST -- Max Patkin at the wheel. He waves at the team bus and honks. 
The opening bars on the National Anthem -- "Oh Say Can You See" 
And Max roars off through the rolling green-landscape... 
Hit Hank Williams music to play over:

A WINSTON-SALEM BATTER lines a double off the wall. 
CUT TO: 
INT. DURHAM RADIO STATION -- DAY 
TEDDY THE ANNOUNCER re-creates the game for broadcast with a several second delay. 
HIS ASSISTANT (P.A. ANNOUNCER FROM THE BALLPARK) has a phone to her ear, and writes down each play on a piece of paper, holding it up for Teddy who enhances shamelessly in his ON THE AIR "play by play". 
CLOSE ON PAPER -- His assistant writes "DOUBLE TO LEFT". 
TEDDY HITS A TINY MALLET against a jar. Thunk. The sound of ball hitting bat. He punches one of several tape cassettes cued up. A crowd roars. An array of special effects is at his fingertips. 
TEDDY (on the air) ...double off the wall by Higgins, and once again the Durham pitchers are unable to get the first out of the inning... 
HIS ASSISTANT WRITES ANOTHER NOTE -- "ERROR MCFEE" 
Thunk -- The mallet again. 
TEDDY (on the air) Line drive to center -- a diving stab by McFee -- ohhhh!  Ball gets by his glove, another run in and the crowd loves it -- 
PUNCHES A CASSETTE -- A crowd roars. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. HIGHWAY THROUGH SMOKY MOUNTAINS -- NIGHT 
The bus rolls through a small town. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CHEAP MOTEL IN GREENSBORO -- DAWN 
THE TEAM BUS PULLS IN -- Players stagger off, half asleep. 
TEDDY (O.S.) (on the air) Bulls will attempt to end a six game losing streak against the Greensboro Astros with Nuke LaLoosh on the hill... 
CUT TO: 
INT. GREENSBORO BALLPARK LOCKER ROOM -- DAY 
NUKE DRESSES FOR THE GAME -- He pulls the RED PANTIES out of his bag. Looks around the clubhouse. Nobody sees them. He's embarrassed anyway -- and stuffs them back. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. GREENSBORO BALLPARK DAY 
NUKE WINDS AND DELIVERS -- The batter swings, and: 
CUT TO: 
INT. RADIO STATION -- DAY

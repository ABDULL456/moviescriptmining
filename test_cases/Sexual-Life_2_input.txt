GWEN No, you don't understand. 
DESK CLERK Yes.  I do. 
(beat) 
More than you might think. 
Gwen stares at him. 
DESK CLERK Shall I close out the account? 
GWEN No.  I need the room after all. 
(beat) 
Will you show me the way there? 
The Desk Clerk looks at her with no apparent interest. 
DESK CLERK You're in luck.  I was just about to take my break. 
CUT TO 
INT. ELEVATOR - DAY 
The Desk Clerk and Gwen ride in the elevator.  Silently.  There is no discernible connection between them. 
CUT TO 
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY 
The Desk Clerk leads Gwen to the room.  It couldn't look more business-like. 
CUT TO 
INT. HOTEL ROOM - DAY 
They enter.  He locks the door.  She surveys the room. 
DESK CLERK Something from the mini-bar? 
GWEN No. 
DESK CLERK How's the air conditioning? 
GWEN Fine. 
DESK CLERK Shall I pull down the covers? 
GWEN I suppose. 
DESK CLERK Do you want to know my name? 
GWEN No. 
He takes her in his arms. 
DESK CLERK You're shaking. 
GWEN I'll be fine. 
(beat) 
This could get you in trouble.  You could lose your job, right? 
DESK CLERK I don't care. 
GWEN You don't even know me. 
DESK CLERK You're right. 
GWEN We have nothing in common. 
Beat. 
DESK CLERK That's where you're wrong. 
He begins to unbutton her blouse.  Without touching.  Without affection.  After a beat, she begins to unbutton his shirt. 
CUT TO 
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - DAY 
A little later.  A maid vacuums the carpet as the Desk Clerk emerges, followed by Gwen.  They cross to the elevator, as business-like as before. 
DESK CLERK (to the Maid)

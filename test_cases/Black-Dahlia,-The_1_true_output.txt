ELIZABETH SHORT What would you like to talk about?

FADE OUT 
EXT. THE SANTA MONICA PIER - NIGHT 
Kay and Bucky sit on a bench, looking out at the water. 
KAY I could take sick days. Maybe a trip to Santa Barbara, or even a drive to San Francisco... 
BUCKY Kay. 
FAY You don't owe him a thing, Bucky. I know you won't believe me. But you've more than repaid him already. 
He looks at her and she knows it's useless. 
KAY (cont'd) When? 
BUCKY First thing. 
She takes his hand. 
KAY You're a fool, Dwight. 
EXT. THE SAN DIEGO FREEWAY - LATE MORNING 
as Bucky crosses the border into Mexico. 
VOICE OVER I closed out my glory days the only way I knew how--I chased the gone man. 
EXT. TIJUANA STREETS - VARIOUS SHOTS - DAY 
Bucky hands out pennies and nickels to locals, flashing both his badge and snapshots of Lee. 
CUT TO: 
BUCKY AND AN ENTOURAGE OF TRAILING LOCALS 
as Bucky tries to shake them, pulling out his pockets to show them he has no more coins. 
CUT TO: 
BUCKY QUESTIONING TIJUANA COPS 
graduating from small change to one dollar bills. Same of them seem to have stories to tell. 
VOICE OVER I got headshakes, bullshit broadsides and a strange series of tales that rang true. One had "el blanco explosivo" beating the shit out of three jack rollers, then buying off the cops with double-saws peeled from a large roll. Another had Lee donating 200 scoots to a leper ministry priest and then driving to Ensenada. 
EXT - THE COASTAL ROAD - LATE AFTERNOON 
as Bucky drives South, passing a sign which says "ENSENADA 60 MI." 
He passes a cluster of families walking on the side of the road. They carry suitcases and head North. 
EXT. THE COAST ROAD - NEAR ENSENADA 
Bucky approaches Ensenada. The trickle of families headed north has now becoming a roadside migration march. Every fifth of sixth marcher carries a torch or lantern. 
EXT. THE CITY LIMITS OF ENSENADA - NIGHT 
Bucky cruises slowly into town and the most blatant shakedown he's ever seen: 
Rurales in brownshirts walk from peasant to peasant in the northbound migration line, taking money and attaching tags to their shoulders with staple guns; plainclothes cops sell bags of beef jerky and dried fruit, putting coins into dispensers attached to their belts. 
Two Rurales pull a man out of line and beat him senseless with the butts of their sawed-off shotguns. 
VOICE OVER I decided it would be wise to check in with the law before going out to question the Ensenada citizenry. 
EXT. THE ENSENADA POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Bucky stands outside a converted church with the word POLICIA painted in black over religious scenes. 
INT. THE POLICE STATION - NIGHT 
Velvet wall hangings depicting Jesus decorate the entrance hall. Blackshirts lounge on converted pews, a huge carved cross on the front desk betrays its altar origins. 
Bucky slides the Rurale at the desk his badge and a dollar. The man saunters off down the hall. 
INT. THE POLICE CHIEF'S OFFICE - MINUTES LATER 
as Bucky is escorted in. The man sitting behind the desk looks up. In flawless English: 
CAPTAIN VASQUEZ Officer Bleichert. Come in, please. I'm Captain Vasquez. How can I help you? 
Bucky exchanges his badge for a photo of Lee. 
BUCKY This man's LAPD. He's been missing in Mexico since January. He was last seen headed here. 
Vasquez studies the photo. Bucky senses a twitch... 
CAPTAIN VASQUEZ No. I'm afraid not. I'll ask my men, however. Staying the night? 
BUCKY At least. 
VASQUEZ Are you here alone? 
BUCKY I have two partners waiting for me in Tijuana. 
Vasquez nods, hard to know if he believes Bucky any more than Bucky believes him. 
BUCKY (cont'd) If you don't mind I'll check back in the morning. 
CAPTAIN VASQUEZ Please. 
CUT TO: 
INT. A FLEABAG MOTEL ROOM - LATER 
Bucky squeezes a bit of brown water onto a handkerchief and wipes his brow off. He kicks his travel bag underneath the bed and heads out. 
EXT. THE HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
as Bucky pulls two hairs from his head and spit-glues them to the door jamb. 
EXT. THE ENSENADA STREETS - NIGHT 
Garish neon, military personnel. Brownshirts packing serious weapons keeping the mostly white street crowd in order. 
HIS POV: An adobe streetfront with a neon sign: "CLUB BOXEO". Bucky goes inside. 
INT. THE CLUB BOXEO - CONTINUOUS 
Bucky finds a brightly lit room filled with sailors and half- dressed Mexican strippers. He stands on his tip-toes trying to see over the crowd to find somebody with the air of proprietor. 
Cn a far wall: boxing publicity stills. He wanders over.

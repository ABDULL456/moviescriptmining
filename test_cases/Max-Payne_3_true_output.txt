Bravura stands, finishing a note. 
RAVURA A New Jersey unit ID'd him near his old house. It shouldn't be long. 
B nods, somberly mulling this over. 
BB You have to find him first, protect him. Some of the guys from Alex's unit beat you to him, they won't wait for a trial. 
EXT. STORAGE SPACE - NIGHT 
At the edge of a strip mall, a ramshackle personal storage business sits behind a razor-wire fence. Inside the fence, rows of stalls for rent, covered by metal garage doors. 
here's the faint sound of METAL STRETCHING, and Max is over the fence. He moves through the rows, reading the numbers. 
A padlock hangs from the door, shining metal glazed over with a sheet of ice. Max finds a pristine key on a ring in his pocket. Hands shaking, he cracks the ice and tries... I NT. STORAGE SPACE 
The garage door raises, cold metal RATTLING as it rolls up. 
Max stands silhouetted in the doorway, looking in on ragged stacks of cardboard boxes. His breath blooming around him.

Max steps inside, pulling a box marked `GARAGE' out into the light. Opening it, he roots around and finds a flashlight. Switched on, a golden beam cuts through the blue shadows. 
Max walks deeper into the space, brushing the light over the boxes. He holds his hand over one, as if warming it... 
Max opens the box. 
aiting for him under the flaps, a stuffed animal stares up at Max from inside the box. Silly grin, frozen eyes shining. 
Hands trembling, Max pushes the toy aside. Deeper in the box, he finds a framed picture and pulls it into the light... 
The photograph is of Max - younger, cleaner, genuinely smiling. Posed along with him, Olan Mills-style, are Elizabeth and the baby. Gauzy backdrop, church clothes. 
Max studies it, haggard new face reflecting in the glass... 
Abruptly, Max jumps up and moves away from the box. Long strides, trying in vain to physically shake the memories, to block out the emotions with something productive... 
The flashlight beam keeps sweeping, deeper and deeper. Max chokes back tears, occasionally glancing at the baby box. 
he beam hits on a document box in the back row.   `OFFICE.' 
Max rushes over, nearly tipping the other boxes in his hurry to throw the lid off the document box. Rows of folders, all M neatly labeled with feminine script. 
ax brushes his fingers over the tabs, smiling sadly.    Each year numbered -- `1998,' `1999,' `2000'... 
MAX (to himself) Okay, Chelle. Help me, here... 
Max's fingers skim to the last file in the box, marked `2004.' Much thinner than the others. Her last year. 
Only one file in the final section. Max opens it, finding pages of handwritten notes, photocopies, drawings... 
Closing the file, he checks the name on the tab and frowns.

EXT. STORAGE SPACE - NIGHT 
Max steps out of the storage locker. He tucks the manila folder inside his coat and pulls the metal door closed. 
He starts away, retracing his steps to the fence. Mind reeling with what he's just seen, the memories flooding back-- 
There's a second set of footprints in the snow before him. 
Max freezes, their significance immediately registering. 
OICE (O.S.) Stay where you are! 
A YOUNG COP steps out of the shadows behind Max, pistol trained on the back of his head. The cop's eyes are wide M with panic. He assumes an awkward, textbook firing position. 
AX (turning slowly) Relax, I'm a cop. 
YOUNG COP Don't move! I know who you are. 
he gun stays trained on Max.    Slowly, he raises his hands. 
MAX Just relax. I need you to trust me for a minute...

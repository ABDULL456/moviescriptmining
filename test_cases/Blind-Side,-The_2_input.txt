LEIGH ANNE I suppose they can be on the team, too. Are you going to protect the family, Michael? 
He nods. She nods back and walks away, past Bert Cotton. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) Yelling at him won't help. He doesn't trust men. In his experience they pretend to care about you 'til they disappear. Cotton chuckles.. She walks over and sits next to SJ, who has the video camera in his lap. 
LEIGH ANNE (CONT'D) You're gonna wanna get this. 
INTERCUT VIDEO AND LIVE ACTION: At the snap Michael drives the defender into the dirt. Michael drops back, knocks down one defender, then takes on another while Tony completes a pass. On a sweep to his side, Michael pushes three defenders away, clearing an alley for Bobby to blast through. 
Bert shakes his head, turns to Leigh Anne -- 
COTTON What'd you say to him? 
(CONTINUED) 
120 CONTINUED: 
LEIGH ANNE You should get to know your 
players, Bert. He tested 98 percent in protective instincts. 
(off Bert's look) I told you you.could thank me later. (a beat for effect) 
It's later, Bert! 
COTTON 
(BY ROTE) Thank you, Leigh Anne. 
121 EXT. WINGATE - STADIUM -- NIGHT 
Packed'house - bands, banners, cheerleaders. IN THE STANDS: Sean, Leigh Anne and SJ take their seats and check out the raucous crowd. 
SEAN So much for home field advantage. 
LEIGH ANNE You ever seen so many rednecks in one place? 
SJ Nascar, not even close. 
122 INT. WINGATE - LOCKER ROOM -- NIGHT 
Coach Cotton is addressing his team before the game. 
COTTON On the schedule it says this is a home game but don't be deceived, gentlemen. Three fourths of the people in the stands are here from Milford. They'll be loud and rowdy and a lot of 'em drunk. Keep your helmets on 'til you're on the sidelines. I don't want anyone getting beaned with a whiskey bottle. 
(BEAT) Grab a knee. And the team huddles for their prayer... 
(CONTINUED) 
122 CONTINUED: 
COTTON (CONT'D) For we can... (team repeats each phrase) Do all things... Through Jesus Christ... Who strengthens us... Each and every day... 
And may God... Bless the Crusaders! As they rise to leave-- 
COTTON (CONT'D) Oh, one more thing. The reason Milford traveled all that way to come here is they expect to whup your ass. Whup your ass and have a party in your house. Whup your ass, have a party in your house and piss on your mama's new couch. Is that gonna happen? The team erupts with a chorus of NO'.s and HELL NO!s. 
123 EXT. WINGATE - EDGE OF STANDS - NIGHT 123 
As the Wingate Crusaders exit the dressing room they find themselves next to the Milford Lions ready to take the field. The cocky Milford players eye the Crusaders. 
MILFORD PLAYER 
Hey, Crusaders, y'all gonna turn the other cheek or just bend over?! Another Milford player, #66, spots Michael. 
MILFORD #66 Would y'all look at the size of that buck! 
Milford takes the field. Jay Collis, to Michael... 
JAY COLLIS Pay 'em back on the field. Coach Cotton raises a hand and the team moves forward to squeeze through an entrance onto the field. Above them Milford fans look down and jeer, toss sodas at them. 
The Blind Side -- Yellow Draft - 04/15/09 82 
124 EXT. WINGATE - STADIUM - NIGHT 124 
MILFORD DAD Damn, that ain't fair! They got a big ole' black bear playing for 'em! What is this, a circus?! 
IN THE STANDS 
Leigh Anne, Sean and SJ cheer as Wingate runs onto the field. A chorus of BOOS comes from the stands behind them. 
MILFORD DAD (CONT'D) There's the Lions and here come the Christians! SJ turns and gives a dirty look -- 
LEIGH ANNE SJ, eyes forward! Sticks and stones... 
ON THE FIELD 
The ball is kicked off and Bobby, the Crusaders tailback takes it in at the five yard line. He makes one player miss then is dragged down by a swarm of defenders at the twenty. 
COTTON Let's go 0! The offense runs onto the field and huddles. The Milford defense waits, slapping each other and building to a frenzy. Number 66 from before is the defensive end on Michael's side. Wingate breaks huddle and #66 sees him.

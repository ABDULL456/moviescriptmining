{"train": "\"Sleepy Hollow\", early, by Andrew Kevin Walker \nSleepy Hollow \nBeing the true storie of one Ichabod Crane and the Headless Horseman \nKevin Yagher and Andrew Kevin Walker \nBased on \"The Legend of Sleepy Hollow\" by Washington Irving \nScreenplay by Andrew Kevin Walker \nThird Draft \nA pleasing land of drowsy head it was, of dreams that wave before the half shut eye... \nEXT.  GNARLED FOREST -- NIGHT \nAn UGLY MAN charges through on a horse, holding a lantern forward on a long pole. He looks back, terrified. \nINSERT TITLE:  1799 Sleepy Hollow, New York \nTHUNDEROUS HOOFBEATS are HEARD behind. \nThe ugly man glances back again.  His lantern swings wild... SHATTERS against a tree.  The jammed-up pole SLAMS the ugly man off his horse... \nHe hits the ground.  He runs, trips, falls and scrambles up. \nDEEP IN THE FOREST, we glimpse the source of the HOOFBEATS: a HUGE FORM on a HUGE BLACK HORSE, already gone. \nThe ugly man pushes through thorny bushes.  Jagged branches slit his hands and cheeks. \nHe bursts from the briar patch and tumbles to a trail.  He lifts his bloodied face.  He runs. \nIN THE FOREST BEHIND: the hooves of the black horse rip underbrush.  HOOFBEATS DEAFENING.  A spur digs into the snorting steed's already bleeding flank. \nThe pursuer's gloved hand draws a SWORD, blade RINGING. \nON THE TRAIL, the ugly man runs on.  The shrill WHISTLE of a SWORD SWING is HEARD as the pursuer blurs past. \nThe ugly man is still running when his head lolls back, at an impossible angle... tumbles off his shoulders... His headless body hits the dirt. \nEXT.  CITY STREETS -- NIGHT \nEmpty cobblestone streets.  Crooked buildings.  A RAPIDLY CLANGING BELL breaks the silence from afar. \nINSERT TITLE:  New York City \nTWO CONSTABLES clamor round a corner, lanterns held high, listening.  They rush into an alleyway. \nELSEWHERE, piers border the Hudson River.  The BELL is LOUDER. The two constables arrive, searching.  No one around. Constable One hefts his pistol, scared. \nCONSTABLE ONE Where are you?! \nMAN'S VOICE (o.s.) Here!  Over here! \nThey hurry to the river's edge.  Down a hill, the MAN, another constable, stands with his back to us.  He's waist deep in water, tossing away his ALARM BELL. \nMAN I need your help with this. \nConstable Two crosses on the peir above.  Constable One moves forward, wary.  The MAN grunts, lifting something. \nCONSTABLE ONE Constable Crane?  Ichabod Crane... is that you? \nThe MAN turns.  Meet ICHABOD CRANE, handsome, eyes piercing. \nICHABOD Yes, it is me.  But, not only me... (lifting, struggling) I found someone here... \nHe drags a bloated MALE CORPSE up from the murky water. \nICHABOD Someone quite dead. \nEXT.  WATCHHOUSE/JAIL -- NIGHT \nThe elderly HIGH CONSTABLE lifts a blanket off the corpse on a wheelbarrow manned by Constable Two.  A snobby MAGISTRATE looks, disgusted.  Constable One and Ichabod wait. \nHIGH CONSTABLE Burn it. \nCONSTABLE ONE Yes, sir. \nConstable Two wheels the corpse inside.  Ichabod's dismayed. \nICHABOD Just a moment... if I may.  It is possible this man was murdered. \nHIGH CONSTABLE He drowned.  Anyone could see. \nICHABOD There are surgical ways of telling how he died... by the water in his lungs... \nIchabod follows the High Constable and Magistrate in. \nINT.  WATCHHOUSE, NIGHT WATCH QUARTERS -- NIGHT \nConstable Two wheels the body ahead past many \"booking\" tables.  A JAILER moves to unlock a massive door. \nHIGH CONSTABLE He will be burned pursuant to statutes of health. \nICHABOD I could determine if he were dead before he went into the Hudson. \nHIGH CONSTABLE Must we again hear these heretical rantings? \nMAGISTRATE Yes, must we? \nIchabod ponders this as he continues.  Ahead on a hill: the grand Van Tassel Manor House. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL MANOR HOUSE, SITTING ROOM -- DAY \nMANY CHILDREN, in a circle, taunt a BLINDFOLDED YOUNG WOMAN spun round by the handsome, barrel-chested man, BROM VAN BRUNT.  A few YOUNG MEN and LADIES watch.  Brom releases the woman.  Everyone quiets and avoids her searching hands. \nBLINDFOLDED WOMAN This is such a silly game. \nBROM Be a sport and stop complaining. \nThe woman moves to Brom's voice.  He backs away, flanked by peers GLENN and THEODORE.  Children laugh. \nIchabod enters, clearing his throat.  No one notices.  The blindfolded woman keeps grasping.  One LITTLE GIRL sees Ichabod and goes to him, finger to her lips. \nLITTLE GIRL Play along.  You must. \nShe tugs him.  Before Ichabod can protest, he is placed in the blindfolded woman's grip. \nBLINDFOLDED WOMAN There, I have someone.  Am I finished? \nLITTLE GIRL You have to tell who it is. \nThe woman touches Ichabod's face.  He is uncomfortable, affected by this caress.  Brom watches jealously. \nLITTLE GIRL At least make a guess. \nBLINDFOLDED WOMAN I don't know.  Is it Brom Bones? \nBROM Certainly not. \nICHABOD Excuse me, Miss... (takes her hands) They have a laugh at your expense. \nShe takes the kerchief off to reveal a stunning beauty: KATRINA VAN TASSEL.  Ichabod tries to compose himself. \nKATRINA Forgive me, I didn't know. \nICHABOD I... I am looking for Baltus Van Tassel. \nBROM We haven't heard your name yet, friend. \nICHABOD Well, unless your name is Baltus, you should not worry over mine. \nBrom grabs Ichabod's collar, pissed.  Ichabod's baffled. \nBROM You need some manners. \nKATRINA Brom! \nBrom looks at her, then reluctantly releases Ichabod. \nMAN'S VOICE (o.s.) What is this, then... ? \nBALTUS VAN TASSEL, 45, has entered, a working-class aristocrat.  LADY VAN TASSEL, 40, stands behind, a mix of home-spun wife and well-kept lady. \nBALTUS Can I help you, sir? \nIchabod's relieved to have a proper focal point.  Children gather around Katrina and hide behind her. \nICHABOD I have been sent from the city with a letter of introduction. I am told you offer me room and board. \nIchabod hands over papers.  Baltus reads, furrows his brow. \nICHABOD If we could speak alone. \nBALTUS (nods, looks to Katrina) This is not a time for frivolity, Katrina, is it?  Am I mistaken? \nKATRINA They're only children, father. \nBaltus snorts, then exits with Ichabod.  The others huddle to gossip, except Katrina, who moves beside Lady Van Tassel to watch Ichabod and Baltus walk down the hall. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, PARLOR -- DAY \nDOCTOR LANCASTER, 50, dour and always sweaty, takes a seat by the fire, joining Baltus and three other elders.  A pretty servant, SARAH, brings a pipe cradle while Lady Van Tassel sets down food.  Ichabod is standing. \nBALTUS That will be all, ladies. (waits as they exit) We are joined by Doctor Thomas Lancaster, Constable.  And to his left are, Clergyman Steenwyck and our able magistrate, Samuel Philipse, both keeping order in their own ways. \nPHILIPSE is youngest, eyes bloodshot, mug in hand and pipe in mouth.  CLERGYMAN STEENWYCK is formidably built, wearing a constant look of disapproval. \nBALTUS I myself am in charge of financial matters and the regulation of currency in our commonwealth.  And, lastly, this fine fellow is James Hardenbrook, our Notary. \nHARDENBROOK is oldest, ancient, with one eye pale and blind. \nICHABOD An honor, gentlemen.  In time I will need every detail of the three murderings you've had, but, for now, I ask only if you have any theory at all as to who the killer might be? \nDOCTOR LANCASTER Excuse me? \nICHABOD I say, is there any one person suspect in these acts? \nDOCTOR LANCASTER I was afraid of this. \nPhilipse shoots a look to Baltus.  Angst amongst the elders. \nPHILIPSE Well, Constable... are you aware... to be honest, you are not what we expected.  We sent for the militia. \nICHABOD The militia? \nFATHER STEENWYCK Why not tell us what you have heard? Hmm?  How much have your superiors bothered to tell you? \nICHABOD All I know is three are slain, their heads found severed from their bodies... \nFATHER STEENWYCK The heads were not found severed. The heads were not found at all. \nPHILIPSE Someone leave him a horse. \nYoung Masbath watches his father go.  Brom coaxes him away. At the back of the crowd, Ichabod watches skeptically, looks to Young Masbath as he and Brom pass. \nICHABOD You worry for naught, little man. Nothing will harm him there. (looks up, sotto) It is problems here on the ground you people need begin to worry about. \nIchabod watches Jonathan climb, very high above. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nIchabod makes notations in a LEDGER BOOK. \nKATRINA (v.o.) You will dream. \nKatrina strolls in, sits on the bed.  Ichabod is nervous. \nKATRINA Did they tell?  It is something in the air so that dreams come to everyone.  According to the elders, an Indian prophet held powwows here before the land was taken, and spells cast then still linger to this day. \nICHABOD Do you often make a habit of sitting on strange men's beds? \nKATRINA You are horribly old-fashioned, aren't you? \nICHABOD Feel free to form your own opinion. (facing his ledger) Though it appears you already have. \nKATRINA Well, I intended to apologize for the behavior of my friend Brom Van Brunt, but it seems I've made matters worse. (getting up to go) I'll leave you to your business. \nICHABOD Excuse me... I should apologize.  I, um... I... have no great love of... \nKATRINA Other people? \nICHABOD Small talk. \nKATRINA It might have been more.  Might have been positively grand talk. \nIchabod offers his chair, backing away.  Seeing it is the only one, he remains standing.  Katrina sits. \nKATRINA Is it me, or are you this nervous around all women? \nICHABOD Perhaps it is because your suitor's hands were recently very nearly wrapped around my throat. \nKATRINA My suitor? \nICHABOD The massive fellow... Brom.  For someone you call \"friend,\" he misplaces a good portion of jealousy. \nKATRINA He has proposed to me twice. \nICHABOD Which may explain his temperament. To have asked twice means the answer was \"no\" at least once. \nKatrina looks down, discards this with a smile. \nKATRINA I've read a great deal about your New York City.  Do be a dear and tell me all about it.  Sounds like an extraordinary place to live a life. \nICHABOD Extra ordinary, yes.  But first, you tell me about the Headless Horseman. \nEXT.  BELLTOWER FIELD -- NIGHT \nThe torches burn bright.  ABOVE, in the Belltower, Jonathan Masbath loads a rifle.  THUNDER BOOMS. \nJonathan stands, looking to a sky that is all stars and moon. A HORSE is HEARD SHRIEKING.  Below, the horse tied at the base of the tower is spooked. \nA COMMOTION is HEARD, ground rumbling.  Jonathan grips a rifle, cocks it and moves to look... \nAt the forest edge, a herd of deer stampedes out.  They sprint past the tower and across the field. \nJonathan crosses to watch the herd scatter.  He crosses back to peer at the forest.  Bad news... \nA thick FOG creeps from the woods. \nAs the fog overtakes the base of each torch, a tentacle of mist snakes up to the flame, killing it.  All along the forest, arms of vapor snuff torches... one by one by one... \nAbove, Jonathan sights the rifle along the trees. \nJONATHAN Come out, devil... come.... \nINT. VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nIchabod leans on a dresser.  Katrina's still seated. \nKATRINA Not all think it is the Horseman. Many say witches come from the Western Woods to steal skulls for their cauldrons.  Some believe a person in this very town kneels before Lucifer, offering death as tribute.  And, still others believe none of it. \nICHABOD Are you so superstitious? \nKATRINA To call a person superstitious is to imply they fear magic, but not all magic is black. \nICHABOD There is no such thing as magic. \nKATRINA Really?  Then... what is your rebuttal to those romantic poets claiming proof of magic in a rose at full bloom, or even in a teardrop? \nICHABOD Poets have silly notions about plants and bodily secretions. \nKATRINA (laughs) You are funny. \nIchabod doesn't get what's so funny about that.  The DISTANT TOLL of a BELL is HEARD.  Katrina looks fearful. \nShe goes to open a window.  The BELL TOLLS... \nEXT.  SLEEPY HOLLOW, OVERVIEW -- NIGHT \n... TOLLS mournfully over farms and forests... \nEXT.  FARM -- NIGHT \nBROM Yes.  Seems he panicked across here and broke two legs. \nICHABOD Who took the meat? \nBALTUS Must have been the Redman.  A Lenape Indian lives in the Western Woods. \nICHABOD These woods of yours sound a bit crowded, what with all the witches, ghouls and Indians living there. \nBrom climbs up onto his own horse, a black beauty. \nBROM There's only one Lenape.  He eats small animals and lost children... and the occasional constable when he can get it. \nBrom rides.  Ichabod goes to the dead horse, digs in his satchel for a thin iron tool, which he uses it to pry off one HORSESHOE.  A WHISTLE is HEARD O.S. \nEveryone looks far ahead to where Van Ripper has ridden.  The doctor and others are there.  Van Ripper waves. \nINT. FOREST, MASBATH MURDER SITE -- MORNING \nDoctor Lancaster stands with SEVERAL ARMED MEN.  A coffin on a cart is covered by a blanket. Ichabod is crouched nearby. \nICHABOD Why did you move the body, Doctor? \nDOCTOR LANCASTER To place it inside its coffin. \nIchabod, nods, vaguely annoyed.  He puts the horseshoe into a hoofprint in the dirt.  It fits. \nIchabod rises, walks, studying the ground, kicking up leaves. Brom, Van Ripper, Baltus and Philipse watch. \nIchabod finds a deep hoofprint.  Huge.  He compares the horseshoe.  The hoofprint is much larger. \nIchabod pulls his satchel off his shoulder, takes out a bowl, bottle of water and bag of brown powder; begins mixing water and powder with a fork to make plaster. \nThe others watch, finding this bizarre, whispering.  Brom comes up to stand over Ichabod, irritated. \nBROM What the hell are you doing? \nICHABOD (ignoring pause) You are the blacksmith.  Ever shod a horse with a hoof this large? \nBROM Never.  A shoe that size I would have remembered. \nIchabod starts to fill the print with plaster. \nICHABOD Van Ripper.  Can you show where the body lay? \nVAN RIPPER I can show exactly. \nVan Ripper dismounts, wiping tobacco drool.  Ichabod rises to follow with his satchel. \nVAN RIPPER Here... in front of this oak, facing north.  Horrible... \nICHABOD To the best of your recollection, where did the open wound fall? \nVan Ripper points.  Ichabod takes a BOTTLE of WHITE POWDER from his pocket. \nHe uncorks the bottle, cautiously pouring powder in an x on the dirt there, then waiting. \nA chemical reaction causes the powder to bubble a bit. \nICHABOD There was not much blood, was there? \nVAN RIPPER I didn't see none. \nIchabod stands, puzzled.  He walks to the coffin cart, rolling up his sleeves.  Others come to watch, but keep distance.  Ichabod removes the blanket... \nReveals Jonathan's headless corpse. \nPhilipse can't look.  Ichabod takes strange spectacles from his satchel; wire-framed with many lenses.  MAGNIFICATION SPECTACLES.  He examines the gross neck wound, sniffs it. \nHe pokes the flesh and severed spinal cord. \nICHABOD No bleeding. \nDOCTOR LANCASTER What is that? \nICHABOD This should have bled by the pint. Yet, no blistering or scorched flesh. How... ?  Whatever weapon was used... it cauterized somehow.... \nIchabod straightens, eyes weirdly big in the spectacles. \nICHABOD It instantly burnt the wound shut. \nEXT.  CHURCHYARD AND CEMETERY -- DAY \nA coffin in a grave.  Headstone reads \"MASBATH, 1799.\"  A CROWD gathered.  Young Masbath broods.  Clergyman Steenwyck steps forward to take a handful of newly dug dirt. \nMen with guns stand at the outskirts, like on guard. \nSteenwyck sprinkles dirt into the grave with prayerful words. In the crowd people whisper.  They steal glances at Ichabod, who stands with the Van Tassels. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING/VARIOUS ROOMS -- DAY \nDining room.  Sarah and two other servants collect plates.  A few people still sup, including Van Ripper, his warty WIFE and two kids.  Van Ripper guzzles ale, laughs at something his also-drunk wife says. \nIN the HALL and FOYER, funeral goers socialize quietly. \nFURTHER ON, in the SITTING ROOM, men smoke.  Young Masbath is confronting Ichabod, who is leaving... \nICHABOD I am not here for revenge.  I am here to bring justice. \nYOUNG MASBATH Whatever.  You still need a second to tend to your things. \nICHABOD I manage fine alone. \nYoung Masbath falls in the grass... \nDaredevil's pounding hooves will certainly crush him. \nDaredevil leaps over Young Masbath, continuing the charge. \nPhilipse has a long way to go before home.  He looks over his shoulder.  No way he'll make it. \nIchabod, running, watches Philipse slow. \nPhilipse gathers all his courage and stops, turning.  The Horseman is closing, sword held high. \nPhilipse raises his talisman. \nICHABOD Philipse! \nPhilipse holds the talisman up, trying to be fearless.  The Horseman swings -- WE HEAR the CLANK of sword on talisman... \nPhilipse's severed head spins.  His body falls and folds. \nIchabod runs past Young Masbath. \nThe Horseman halts just as Ichabod reaches a point in front of dead Philipse, aiming his pistol.  Daredevil lets out a SCREECHY CRY.  The Horseman rides toward Ichabod. \nIchabod gets on one knee, trying to steady his pistol.  The Horseman closes.  Ichabod sweats bullets.  FIRES... \nThe slug SLAMS the Horseman dead center -- bursts through and rends his uniform without slowing him. \nThe Horseman is almost on Ichabod.  Ichabod cringes, arms up... as the Horseman passes. \nThe Horseman leans to skewer Philipse's head with his sword. \nWith the head as his prize, the Horseman races away. \nIchabod gets up, watches the Horseman head to the forest. Ichabod looks to Young Masbath, finds his legs will not support him, falls, trembling.  THUNDER BELLOWS. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SECOND FLOOR HALL -- NIGHT \nLady Van Tassel comes to a door, knocks.  Sarah stands behind with a tray of food.  Young Masbath is seated near. \nLADY VAN TASSEL (to Young Masbath) Has he not come out at all? \nYoung Masbath shakes his head. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nKNOCKING is HEARD.  Ichabod sleeps restlessly. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nTHUNDER BOOMS.  WIND and POUNDING RAIN blast open a window. Mother comes to it, then moves to comfort fearful Young Ichabod in bed. \nMOTHER'S VOICE (v.o.) Don't be afraid... don't be afraid. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY \nA keyhole.  Young Ichabod's eye peers in... \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- P.O.V. THROUGH KEYHOLE \nMother is kneeled before flour on the floor.  She draws patterns in it, whispering.  She blows the flour away. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- DAY \nThe Freakish Woman (who argued with Mother) walks towards the home, supported by a SAD MAN.  She weeps, carrying something in a blanket. \nYoung Ichabod comes a window, watching, scared. \nThe Freakish Woman is so weak that she falls.  The blanket opens... the corpse of an infant tumbles to the dirt.  The Freakish Woman's WAILING GROWS LOUDER. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- FRONT OF YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT \nTWO MEN in black drag Mother to a coach.  She looks back, fearful, pulled along.  A THIRD MAN in black follows. \nYoung Ichabod struggles as Father restrains him. \nYOUNG ICHABOD No... mother... no... ! \nThe Third Man peers back, a gray-haired, Cotton Mather-ish man with a villainous face. \nFREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY \nMany people in the gallery.  The Third Man stands in front of the tearful Freakish Woman in the witness box. \nTHIRD MAN You are certain it was she? \nFREAKISH WOMAN In the lighting, I did see her. (points) Her.  Lady Crane... \nMother sits in shackles. \nFREAKISH WOMAN I will never forget.  The next moment, I found my infant dead... with the blood welt on his breast. \nThose in attendance cry out at this.  Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes filled with tears. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nAs before, a STORM RAGES.  Ichabod is in Mother's arms. \nFREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows. \nEXT.  WINDMILL ROOF -- DAY \nIchabod and Young Masbath climb out a door to the roof.  The rotors spin nearby.  Ichabod searches the countryside. \nBelow, MANY MEN are ride up the long straight road. \nICHABOD What is it? \nYOUNG MASBATH It's payment day.  Loan monies are given to Baltus the last day each month.  Almost everyone borrows... for tools or to hire workers. \nIchabod sits, takes a bowl from his bag and gives it to Masbath, then produces a bottle of water... fills the bowl. \nICHABOD (points) Out there.  What do you see? \nYOUNG MASBATH The Western Woods. \nICHABOD Look again. \nA plume of smoke rises from woods, far. \nYOUNG MASBATH Smoke.  Chimney smoke. \nIchabod holds a piece of straw in his mouth, rubs the point of a sewing needle against a small BLACK ROCK. \nICHABOD Are you familiar with magnets? \nYOUNG MASBATH What kind of nuts? \nICHABOD Not for eating, I assure you.  Watch here. \nIchabod shows the magnet grab the needle.  Young Masbath is amazed, reaching for it.  Ichabod watches him play with it. \nYOUNG MASBATH It's spectacular. \nICHABOD (smiles, pause) Yes... I suppose it is.  Keep it. \nYOUNG MASBATH No, I couldn't... \nICHABOD I have others.  All I need is this. \nIchabod takes the needle, poking its butt end into the tip of the straw.  Young Masbath studies the rock, pockets it. \nYOUNG MASBATH Thank you. \nICHABOD (nods, almost shy) Now, hold the bowl steady.  Back to business. \nYoung Masbath lifts the bowl.  Ichabod drops in the needle/straw which floats and turns compass-like. \nICHABOD If the Western Woods are truly the Devil's Glen, we will see for ourselves. \nYOUNG MASBATH (uneasy) Father said witches live there. \nICHABOD Witches do not exist.  However... \nIchabod uses a knife to notch the bowl lip where the needle points, then surveys the smoke, making a second notch. \nICHABOD Not long ago, I would have said the same for Headless Horseman. \nKATRINA (o.s.) Constable... ! \nKatrina's on horseback below, unhappy. \nKATRINA I need to speak with you.  Alone. \nEXT.  VAN TASSEL GREAT LAWN -- DAY \nIchabod and Katrina lead their horses.  A heated argument. \nKATRINA Why would you do such a thing? \nICHABOD No stone may be left unturned.  It may appear harsh... \nKATRINA I have misjudged you I think.  I did not imagine you were so cruel. \nICHABOD You are not regarding it in full. The Widow Windsor had been run through by a sword.  I followed the bloodless wound, a wound whose path I could not comprehend till I had seen the Horseman with my own eyes. \nKATRINA What are you on about? \nICHABOD The child she carried was eight months grown at least... near to birthing.  The sword had pierced its tiny heart exactly. \nKATRINA Must I hear this? \nICHABOD There was no blind stabbing.  This singular thrust found its target omnipotently, as if the Horseman made certain the unborn child died with its mother. \nKATRINA And this gives worth to butchery? \nICHABOD It was not butchery. \nKATRINA What is it then?  Scientific method? How can any of this matter in the slightest? \nICHABOD I have no solution for its meaning yet, but I could not just ignore it. \nKATRINA Take a lesson from Young Masbath's desires, Ichabod Crane.  He follows with you to avenge his father's death. That I understand.  But, what do you want? \nICHABOD To avenge his father, and the others. \nKATRINA But, why?  Tell me why. \nIchabod struggles for a reply. \nKATRINA You falter with your answer because you strive without putting the whole of your heart into it.  Can't you see? You'll bring dignity to the dead even if you have to chop them into little pieces to do it. \nThe Old Crone holds the bat, using a knife to cut off its head.  She soaks the straw with blood, SPEAKING IN TONGUES, guttural.  Using a wick, she lights the straw. \nShe grasps two METAL CUFFS with chains attached, slides these onto her bony wrists, then bends to inhale smoke. \nOLD CRONE He comes now. \nIchabod would like to leave now. \nEXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY \nYoung Masbath, waiting by the horses, looks up.  Through the trees, black clouds billow and block the sun. \nINT.  CAVE HOME, LOWER CAVE -- DAY \nThe old Crone slumps, still with her back to Ichabod.  She does not move.  Wind howls through a hole/window.  Rain. \nCandles blow out.  Ichabod stands, worried. \nICHABOD Excuse me... um... \nShe remains motionless.  The STORM outside intensifies. \nWE SEE the skin of the Crone's wrists transform; swelling in the cuffs, hardening, cracking and bleeding. \nSome thing Ichabod cannot see.  He inches closer. \nICHABOD Are you alright... ? \nThe Crone turns, hideous, leaping erect -- a half-human, half-demon CREATURE.  Its black clawed hands reaching. \nIchabod recoils, crying out. \nChains on restraining cuffs yank the creature back. \nIchabod hits the floor, knocking over a table of bones.  The creature is chained, but still wants Ichabod.  It SCREECHES. \nThe Old Crone's face seethes from transformation, eyes blood red, nostrils dripping, teeth now jagged. \nCREATURE/OLD CRONE You seek the warrior bathed in blood... the Headless Horseman. \nIchabod slides back as far as possible while the creature claws the rock floor, yearning. \nCREATURE/OLD CRONE Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  Follow to the tree of the dead. \nThe creature pulls, testing the chains.  Behind, the BOLT holding the chains to the wall slips.  The wall cracks. \nCREATURE/OLD CRONE Climb down to the Horseman's soulless place and let loose his silent shrieking.  Do you hear?  Do you hear?! \nIchabod nods, quaking, aghast.  He glances to the exit. \nThe chain bolt gives more... coming loose... \nCREATURE/OLD CRONE He who holds fast the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand. Catch hold of his desire. \nIchabod bolts for the door.  The creature HOWLS, leaping... \nThe chain bolt breaks... \nIchabod cries out, tackled to the floor... \nIt is the Old Crone who landed on him.  She has returned to human form, semi-conscious.  Ichabod shoves her off. \nEXT.  CAVE HOME -- DAY \nIchabod runs out into the howling storm, past Masbath. \nICHABOD We are leaving. \nYOUNG MASBATH What happened? \nIchabod scrambles onto Gunpowder, heading further into the woods, glancing back.  Young Masbath follows. \nEXT.  WESTERN WOODS, FURTHER ON -- EARLY EVENING \nNo rain.  Dark.  A lantern's glow creates shifting shadows as Ichabod and Young Masbath ride. \nYOUNG MASBATH Follow the Indian trail to where the sun dies.  To the tree of the dead. (looking back) Maybe we passed it by. \nICHABOD How could something named \"the tree of the dead\" fail to draw attention? \nA BIRD CRIES OUT.  Ichabod's startled, looking up.  The BIRD is HEARD ALIGHTING.  Leaves float downwards. \nICHABOD We should not go much further in this murk. \nYOUNG MASBATH Should we go back? \nICHABOD We are far from the Hollow. (dismounts, troubled) Loath to say it... better to get our backs against a tree and stay till morning. \nEXT.  WESTERN WOODS (TIME CUT) -- NIGHT \nHorses are tied.  Ichabod is seated against a tree.  A campfire burns.  Young Masbath lies on a blanket, rifle cross his chest, staring to treetops. \nLeaves and branches shift in the wind.  Bats fly wildly. \nYOUNG MASBATH What does it mean... climb down to the Horseman's soulless place? \nICHABOD \"Let loose his silent shrieking.\" Who knows, till we work at it?  I admit not being anxious to find out. (pause) \"He who holds the Horseman's desire will guide his reaping hand.\" Whatever the Horseman's desire is, other than extinguishing lives. \nA SNAPPING BRANCH.  Ichabod raises his pistol. \nICHABOD (to Young Masbath) Do not move. \nKATRINA Stop this!  Leave them alone! \nA SHOT RINGS OUT.  Chaos halts.  Everyone turns, quieting. \nThe men around Masbath and Ichabod turn to face Brom Bones. Brom holds a smoking pistol, flanked by Theodore and Glenn. \nBROM Let them go (pointing) Are you going to beat an orphaned child, imbecile? \nMasbath is released, along with the ledger.  Steenwyck moves forward, pushing people aside. \nFATHER STEENWYCK Are you Ichabod Crane's protector, Brom Bones? \nBROM Only for the moment. \nFATHER STEENWYCK You side with him in this? \nBROM No.  I agree he has only made matters worse.  But, that will change, if you listen. \nHe trades with Theodore, pistol for a long rifle.  Brom hefts the rifle, taking a round slug from his pocket. \nBROM Theodore, Glenn and I offer to ride each day and night to watch over the Hollow.  We will stalk the border of the Western Woods and haunt the Horseman for a change, with rifles like this... and slugs like this... \nBrom brings the slug to his lips, blows.  It WHISTLES. \nBROM Hollowed out and filled with powder. \nBrom smiles at Katrina, who watches unimpressed. \nBROM Constable Crane is not the only one who fights with science on his side. \nICHABOD I fired upon the Horseman and the bullet did nothing. \nBROM You must have missed your mark. \nICHABOD I hit him square. \nBROM (to the crowd) I say... if the Horseman is solid enough to take the lives of our people, he's solid enough to feel this... \nBrom aims the rifle at a BARREL down the road.  FIRES. \nPLUNK -- the barrel is hit -- EXPLODES.  Smoke wafts. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nIn bed, Ichabod is having unpleasant dreams once more. \nFREAKISH WOMAN (v.o.) The night of the great storm, I saw her cross my windows. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- COURTROOM -- DAY \nYoung Ichabod is seated beside Father, eyes tearful.  We are back in the court where Mother stands trial. \nFREAKISH WOMAN In the lightning, I did see her. (points to Mother) Her. Lady Crane... I will never forget it.  The next moment, I found my infant son was dead, with the blood welt on his breast. \nThe evil Third Man turns to a jury of TWELVE MEN. \nTHIRD MAN You have heard it.  The blood welt is the mark of Satan's touch. \nAs the crowd murmurs in fear, Young Ichabod looks to Father, who sits with hands clenched, emotionless. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S HOME -- NIGHT \nIn the quiet kitchen, Young Ichabod looks across the table. Father stares into his food. \nYOUNG ICHABOD She was with me, father. \nFATHER Nothing can be done against them. \nYOUNG ICHABOD She was with me that night. \nFather doesn't even look up. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- CHURCH -- NIGHT \nEmpty church.  Young Ichabod carries a lantern past pews.  A soldier is seated near the altar with a rifle. \nYOUNG ICHABOD May I see her? \nThe soldier exits through a white door.  Young Ichabod waits, looking up at the vast church.  The white door opens and the Third Man steps out. \nTHIRD MAN Go home. \nYOUNG ICHABOD May I see my mother? \nTHIRD MAN You do not want to be here.  Go home to your father. \nYOUNG ICHABOD She did not do it... please listen... \nTHIRD MAN She is guilty. \nYOUNG ICHABOD No, sir, please... she is innocent... \nTHIRD MAN She has confessed. \nYOUNG ICHABOD No. \nTHIRD MAN She has admitted to her evil and signed a written confession.  Do you know what confession is? (off Ichabod's nod) All that is left for you now is to pray for her soul. \nThe Third Man leaves through the white door. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- MORNING \nRain.  Ichabod comes out.  Across the lawn, Young Masbath is bringing the horses. \nLADY VAN TASSEL (o.s.) Good morrow, Constable. \nIchabod turns to see Lady Van Tassel in a chair, sewing. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Returning to the Western Woods? \nICHABOD Yes, actually. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Use caution. \nICHABOD (nods, studies her) Do you know... I think those are the first words I have heard from you my entire time here. \nLADY VAN TASSEL As my husband says, a wife should be always like an echo, and at the same time, quite unlike an echo. (off Ichabod's confusion) Like an echo, she should speak only when spoken to, and unlike an echo, should never try to have the last word, or, at least that is what he believes. \nBaltus comes out the door, irritable, skillet in hand. \nBALTUS Constable... did you notice anything out of the ordinary during the night? \nIchabod eyes the skillet, ill at ease, trying not to be. \nICHABOD Um... I... I did not... no.  Why? \nBALTUS Sarah has gone missing... my servant girl.  Her things are gone.  Damn it. She has joined the migration out of town. (to Lady Van Tassel) What about breakfast, woman?  Or, am I to starve to death? \nLady Van Tassel gets up and goes in, taking the skillet. \nICHABOD I should be going... good day to you. \nIchabod heads towards Young Masbath.  Baltus watches from the porch, disgruntled.  He goes in. \nEXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY \nHeavy rain.  Ichabod and Young Masbath ride side by side. \nYOUNG MASBATH If the Crone's wound bled hard, that means she was not killed by the Hessian.  Someone only tried to make it look that way. \nICHABOD You grow sharper by the minute, little man.  It boggles my mind, but I begin to prefer your company over all others. \nYOUNG MASBATH Well... I'm one of the few people who likes you. \nICHABOD (laughs) True enough. \nYOUNG MASBATH Then, who murdered the Old Crone?  And why? \nICHABOD Good questions, deserving answers, of which we are in short supply. \nA SOUND is HEARD.  Ichabod looks back, then to Masbath. \nICHABOD Quicken pace. \nIchabod rides faster.  Young Masbath keeps up. \nFURTHER ON, they charge over a hill.  Ichabod halts Gunpowder and climbs clumsily off. \nICHABOD Ride on. \nYoung Masbath obeys.  Ichabod takes out his pistol and wades into forest growth, backtracking. \nINSIDE THE FOREST, Ichabod bounds through underbrush, low.  A HORSE is HEARD SNORTING.  He pushes through branches... \nMoving behind a FIGURE IN A GREY CLOAK on horseback. \nICHABOD Halt and turn.  I have a pistol aimed at your head. \nThe figure stops, pushes off the cloak hood.  Katrina. \nKATRINA It is only me. \nICHABOD Katrina.  Why do you follow? \nKATRINA I apologize if I worried you. \nICHABOD A woman should not be out alone in these woods. \nKATRINA But, I am not alone, am I?  I only wished to see what you were up to, and... (takes out WHITE ROSE) To thank you. \nIchabod softens, but doesn't want to. \nICHABOD Come along. \nEXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- DAY \nRaining still.  Ichabod, Masbath and Katrina come into a clearing, mouths falling open at the sight of... \nA monstrously huge TREE OF THE DEAD, at the clearing's center, with branches reaching far and wide, knotted and gross, like agony captured in wood sculpture. \nIchabod dismounts, crossing a line beyond which grass and weeds will not grow.  Young Masbath and Katrina dismount. \nYOUNG MASBATH You were right... it does draw attention to itself. \nIchabod stares up into the endless, dead canopy of branches. He circles the incredibly wide trunk. \nThere's a VERTICAL WOUND in the bark, as if the tree once had a terrible vertical in it, now partially healed and disgustingly scarred.  Ichabod approaches. \nHe feels the mushy scar, picking at its scabs till much sap begins to trickle. It is red and Ichabod fingers it. \nICHABOD Blood. \nKATRINA What did you say? \nBrom readies his ramrod, jamming powder in the barrel. \nThe Horseman charges. \nBrom stands, pulling out the ramrod.  The Horseman is on him. Brom swings the rifle, blocking.  Sparks fly. \nThe battle is on, with Brom fending off the Horseman's sword with the gun -- CLANK -- CLANK -- CLANK. \nACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod and Gunpowder break into the open. \nUP THE FIELD, the Horseman makes a backhanded swing.  Brom goes down, his rifle sent flying. \nBrom rolls to avoid as the Horseman slashes. \nBrom flees.  The Horseman pulls and throws a knife... \nTHWAP -- the knife imbeds in Brom's thigh. \nThe Horseman runs towards Brom. \nIchabod closes in, pulling an unlit lantern off his saddle. \nBrom tries to get up, bends to extract the knife. \nThe Horseman, mid-run, changes his sword grip, blade down. \nHe plants one foot on Brom's back, raising his sword, about to skewer... \nIchabod arrives full gallop, SMASHES the lantern into the Horseman -- knocking the Horseman off Brom. \nAT THE EDGE OF THE FOREST, Theodore and Glen arrive on horseback.  They hold a moment, watching. \nBrom runs, limping, to the barn, goal in sight: farm implements propped there.  Brom grabs SCYTHES with long curved blades, one in per hand. \nThe Horseman rises. \nIchabod turns Gunpowder and leaps off, runs to Brom. \nThe Horseman moves towards them, hefting a battle axe in his free hand.  Ichabod steps up, pistol aimed, furious. \nICHABOD For what it's worth... \nFIRES -- the bullet rips through the Horseman's stomach to reveal putrid innards as he keeps advancing. \nAt the forest, Theodore looks to Glenn, turns and flees. \nBrom steps up, scythes ready.  He and the Horseman go at it. Brom blocks axe and sword, catching and deflecting blows. \nAt the forest, Glenn follows Theodore away. \nIchabod grabs a long handled SICKLE. \nBrom swings the scythes.  The Horseman avoids. \nIchabod moves to the side, looking for an opening.  He swings the sickle. The Horseman blocks. \nThe Horseman battles both at once, catching blows... countering every strike, METAL RINGING. \nBrom catches the Horseman's sword in one scythe, holding it off.  Catches the axe handle in the other scythe. \nThe Horseman flatfoot KICKS Brom's chest, sending him down. \nIchabod swings the sickle blade... \nHits the Horseman, the blade embedding to the hilt. \nThe Horseman drops his axe and grasps the sickle, jerking... \nThe sickle handle SLAMS Ichabod's, knocking him away. \nIchabod crawls, tries to shake off the blow. \nHe looks up.  The Horseman staggers, spastically trying to pull the blade from his body. \nBrom limps to Ichabod, yanks him to his feet. \nBROM We cannot win this. \nThey head towards the forest. \nBehind, the Horseman extracts the sickle, throws it.  He strides after them, picks up his axe on the way. \nEXT.  RIVERBANK -- DAY \nIchabod and Brom stumble down a hillside.  Brom points. \nBROM There... \nThey run to a DOCK at the edge of a wide, rapid river.  They jump into a FLAT BOAT barge. \nBROM Go to the front and guide it. \nIchabod goes.  Brom uses a scythe to slash the ropes. \nIchabod picks up a GUIDE POLE.  The barge lurches, set free. \nIchabod struggles to push the boat out.  it moves swiftly, caught in rain swollen current. \nBrom looks back.  No Horseman.  He leaves the scythe and moves to the front, hefting another pole to help guide. \nBROM Let's see him catch us now. \nIchabod's hurting.  Masbath helps with a shirt. \nYOUNG MASBATH Someone left last night.  Looked like they headed to the square, but I lost them in the forest. \nICHABOD Man or woman? \nYOUNG MASBATH All I saw was their lantern. \nICHABOD Business, best hidden is hidden best at night. \nIchabod goes to his work table, organizing his satchel. \nYOUNG MASBATH If someone has the Horseman's skull... if they control the Horseman, then why haven't they sent him for your head yet? \nICHABOD Because, I serve a fine purpose alive. It is perfection for our murderer if I return to New York City with nothing more than tales of a galloping ghoul. (pause) We must uncover the reason these victims were targeted.  What was taken from them... other than their lives? Who benefits by their deaths? \nIchabod fumbles the bottle of white powder. \nIt bounces, cork popping out... rolls under the bed. \nICHABOD Damn it. \nIchabod kneels, pained.  A trail of the blood-detecting powder has spilled.  The bottle is out of reach. \nYOUNG MASBATH I'll get it. \nYoung Masbath gets down, ready to crawl for it, but Ichabod stops him, peering under. \nICHABOD Wait... \nFar under, near the bottle, some powder is bubbling. \nIchabod moves to the end of the bed and lifts, in pain. Young Masbath helps. They drag the bed to one side. \nUnder the bed: a Satanic PENTAGRAM has been DRAWN IN BLOOD. \nIchabod stares, trying to grasp the implication.  Masbath is about to speak, but Ichabod puts a finger to his lips. \nIchabod moves to lock the door. \nYOUNG MASBATH (whispers) Who did this? \nIchabod does not answer.  He picks up a wash basin and dumps the water to wash the Pentagram away. \nEXT.  TOWN SQUARE/CHURCH -- DAY \nWAGONS, HORSES and TOWNSPEOPLE swarm.  A CROWD loots the town's general store.  Provisions are passed along man to man and loaded on wheelbarrows. \nAll up and down the long straight road, home owners board up windows with lumber. \nIchabod and Young Masbath ride, passing many angry faces. \nICHABOD Panic has set in. \nThey stop, tying their horses and climbing stairs to the door of the \"NOTARY.\"  Ichabod looks off... \nDOWN THE ROAD, at the far end, people head to the church. Much activity there as well. \nICHABOD Sanctuary.  Or, so they hope. \nFamilies put up tents all around the church within the bordering wrought-iron fence.  Supplies abound. \nPeople work to build and erect massive wooden crosses. \nINT.  NOTARY PUBLIC, HARDENBROOK'S OFFICES -- DAY \nTidy room.  Young Masbath watches Ichabod hand a slip of paper to the elderly Notary, Hardenbrook. \nICHABOD Do you have these persons' wills? \nHARDENBROOK I have everything... last testaments... birth certificates, death certificates... deeds. \nICHABOD Yes, sir... but, do you have these? \nHardenbrook studies the paper with his one good eye. \nHARDENBROOK Certainly... certainly. \nHardenbrook nods, handing the list back, grinning.  Ichabod stands waiting.  Hardenbrook is still nodding. \nICHABOD May I see them, Master Hardenbrook? \nHARDENBROOK Hmm?  See them? \nICHABOD May we look at them now? \nHARDENBROOK Of course.  You want them... it shall not take long.  Wait here. \nHardenbrook heads across the room.  Ichabod offers the list. \nICHABOD Maybe you should take this. \nHARDENBROOK A fine idea. \nHardenbrook takes it and exits.  Young Masbath sits. \nYOUNG MASBATH What good is this? \nICHABOD To discover what might have been taken from those who died, it will help to know what was there that could be taken in the first place. \nIchabod waits.  After a moment, he looks uncertain.  He crosses to the half-open door... \nThey move to a second door, quietly.  Ichabod makes another low wax mark. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT \nIchabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall.  Ichabod continues his wax marking at each door. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT \nIchabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door.  Ichabod walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound DOCUMENTS and hands some to Masbath. \nYoung Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these \"LOAN AGREEMENT\" parchments.  Ichabod brings another pile. \nICHABOD (whispering) They are alphabetical. \nYoung Masbath has the M's.  \"MARYIE,\" \"MEGAPOLENISIS,\" AND \"MELYN...\" Not finding what he wants. \nYOUNG MASBATH There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing. \nICHABOD (regarding his documents) There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  \"Paasch, James\" \"Pieter, Thomas\" \"Pos, William.\" \nA FLOORBOARD CREAKS.  Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern. He and Young Masbath stand frozen. \nAcross the room, light comes under the door, stops, then continues.  A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING.  Ichabod crosses to follow, pointing back. \nICHABOD Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room and bolt the door till I return. \nEXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT \nLantern light moves, far ahead.  Ichabod follows. \nEXT.  FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT \nIchabod stops, hidden.  He can see the light ahead, but it is no longer in motion.  He advances. \nEXT.  FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT \nA lantern sits on a rock.  On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX. \nIchabod crawls to peer from underbrush. \nThe couple keeps coupling, with the man on top.  His grunts and gasps are particularly desperate.  He's all over the woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel. \nIchabod swallows, inches closer. \nLady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh. She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back. \nIchabod's eyes widen. \nLady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing deep in her palm.  Blood flows.  She rubs her cut hand over her partner's arching back, smearing blood. \nLady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face... trailing blood.  The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck. \nIchabod backs away, having seen more than plenty. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nYoung Masbath unlocks the door.  Ichabod enters. \nYOUNG MASBATH I was getting worried.  Who was it? \nICHABOD Lady Van Tassel. \nYOUNG MASBATH What was she doing? \nICHABOD Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements? \nYOUNG MASBATH No.  They are all missing. \nThis troubles Ichabod. \nYOUNG MASBATH There is more, though.  While you were gone, I could hear someone else walking through the house. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nIchabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner.  Going to the LAST DOOR, Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing... \nICHABOD (whispers, to himself) Katrina. \nThe wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER AND HALL -- NIGHT \nIchabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax marks.  Young Masbath finds one broken. \nYOUNG MASBATH Here. \nIchabod comes over, pushes the door... \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nThey enter.  The kitchen is empty.  Ichabod crosses to another door, crouches.  Another broken wax mark. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT \nThey enter... the room with the elaborate loom.  Ichabod moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table. \nHe touches the top of a candle.  His finger comes away with a bit of still wet wax. \nYOUNG MASBATH There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone. \nICHABOD It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her. (to convince himself) It is absolutely nothing. \nThey ride, fast. \nEXT.  FOREST -- DAY \nA conjuring pile of straw burns.  Gloved hands unfold a paper filled with clippings of human hair.  The hair is sprinkled on the fire. \nA cloaked FIGURE is kneeled at the pile.  The figure turns to remove A human SKULL from a cloth bag. \nThe skull is placed at center in the flames.  It's teeth are sharp, cut to points.  The HORSEMAN'S SKULL. \nEXT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nIn the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire. People inhabit the tents. \nINT.  CHURCH, STEENWYCK'S QUARTERS -- MORNING \nIN THE CHURCH: it's crowded with families.  Pews filled with bedding and belongings.  Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE DOORS of his quarters, turning, angry. \nFATHER STEENWYCK You are astonishing, Constable.  Do you truly think your ridiculous accusations frighten me? \nIchabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain. \nICHABOD Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must... (points to doors) Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures. \nFATHER STEENWYCK No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say. \nICHABOD Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here. \nFATHER STEENWYCK Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity. \nICHABOD It is only important what you are. An adulterer... \nFATHER STEENWYCK I am the Lord's voice in this town. \nICHABOD Wallowing in sin and lust... \nFATHER STEENWYCK They need guidance. \nICHABOD Wallowing quite literally in blood. \nFATHER STEENWYCK (snapping, quaking) Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell! \nICHABOD He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf. \nIchabod walks.  Steenwyck is humiliated. \nICHABOD You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night. \nFATHER STEENWYCK You cannot do this.  I am a man of God! \nICHABOD Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God. \nINT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nPews are packed.  Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar. EVERYONE QUIETS.  Steenwyck has composed himself, barely. \nFATHER STEENWYCK My friends... dear friends.  Those of you still on your farms, I thank you for coming. \nHe sees Ichabod near the back.  THUNDER is HEARD OUTSIDE. \nFATHER STEENWYCK I... I address unfortunate business. (pause) I am forced to take my leave from Sleepy Hollow.  I will be moving on to do the Lord's work elsewhere. \nThe GATHERERS MURMUR shock.  Ichabod walks out. \nEXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY \nRaining hard.  Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride. \nBALTUS Hurry along.  The meeting has most certainly already begun.  We do not want Steenwyck as our enemy. \nLady Van Tassel trails.  WOOD is HEARD SPLINTERING... \nJust off the road, a tree falls... \nThe trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank. \nThe horse falls.  Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt. \nBaltus looks back, halting. \nLady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns. \nBehind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on Daredevil, stops.  Calm.  He takes his axe in hand. \nEXT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nStorming.  The meeting is letting out.  Near the churchyard gate, Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse cart.  Ichabod walks up as Katrina dismounts. \nKATRINA What is so urgent? \nICHABOD Come with me. \nIchabod leads her to where they can talk away from others. \nKATRINA Why have I not seen your face for so long?  You look much better. \nShe touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan agreements there. \nICHABOD Explain these.  I found them secreted away in the sewing room. \nKatrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt. \nIchabod comes away from the window, looking to panicked citizens.  He sees Katrina moving up the aisle... \nShe's heading towards Baltus, who slams against the door to Steenwyck's room. \nBALTUS Damn you, Steenwyck!  Help me! Let me in! \nRIFLES BOOM LOUDLY as men at the windows begin firing. \nEXT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nThe Horseman circles, under fire. \nGreat clouds of gun smoke shoot from the church. \nMen fire down from the belfry. \nParts of the Horseman and Daredevil splatter red into the rain as slugs hit without effect. \nAT THE OTHER SIDE OF THE CHURCH, the Horseman comes around, heading to the town square. \nINT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nRifleman shout to each other, running to the opposite windows to follow the Horseman. \nYoung Masbath grabs a rifle and leaps to join the brigade. \nBaltus is still beating Steenwyck's door when a HUGE FARMER grips Baltus angrily and throws him... \nHUGE FARMER You'll kill us all! \nBaltus falls, knocking over pews.  Katrina's nearby. \nHUGE FARMER You're the one the Horseman wants. Why should we die for you!? \nKATRINA NO! \nThe huge farmer picks Baltus up, dragging him and shoving Katrina aside as she approaches. \nIchabod's pushing past people, trying to reach them. \nEXT.  CHURCH/TOWN SQUARE -- DAY \nThe Horseman brings Daredevil to a halt, yanking a large coil of ROPE off a hitching post. \nINT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nThe huge farmer shoves Baltus to the floor again. \nHUGE FARMER Get out! \nOthers join the rage, pulling Baltus towards the front of the church, shouting.  Ichabod struggles to push them off. \nICHABOD Stop this! \nIchabod gets to Baltus' side, trying to protect. \nICHABOD The Horseman cannot enter!  It does not matter who he wants, he cannot cross the gate! \nAt the windows, ONE RIFLEMAN turns, crying out. \nONE RIFLEMAN He's coming back! \nMore panic.  The huge farmer moves towards Baltus. \nHUGE FARMER We have to save ourselves! \nBaltus pulls the pistol from Ichabod's holster, brandishing. \nBALTUS No!  Get away from me! \nEXT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nThe Horseman rides past the front, fired upon. \nHe halts at the wrought iron gate, reaching to yank off one POST which is pointed on top, like an arrow head. \nINT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nBaltus holds everyone's back with the pistol. \nBALTUS The next person to lay hands on me will have a bullet.  Stand off! \nKATRINA Father... \nBALTUS No!  We're safe here. (points at Ichabod) You said it.  The Horseman will not have me. \nCRASH, the harpoon-like post SPEARS through a window, trailing rope tied to it... \nCRACK -- SKEWERS Baltus from behind, the bloodied point bursting out his breast bone. \nBaltus looks down, drops the gun... clutching the post with both hands.  Blood streams out his mouth.  Katrina screams. \nThe rope yanks Baltus back.  He SLAMS into the WINDOW... \nEXT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nBaltus CRASHES out, hits the ground, dragged... \nOutside the fence, Daredevil runs with the rope tied around his saddle pommel.  The Horseman strides forward, sword out. \nBaltus SLAMS the fence and the rope snaps.  He is held there awkwardly, gurgling blood. \nKatrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself with, feels a rock and clutches it. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love. \nKATRINA No one will believe your lies, whore. \nLADY VAN TASSEL This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me... \nShe picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand. \nLADY VAN TASSEL He will have that honor. \nEXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT \nThe Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering flesh, heading towards a chasm with no bridge. \nThey reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side. \nEXT.  LONG STRAIGHT ROAD/VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT \nIchabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard. \nEXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT \nLady Van Tassel admires the skull. \nLADY VAN TASSEL (mock sorrow) Woe is me... that spying on my husband in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he and Sarah attacked by the Horseman. Oh pity me... so overcome was I that I wandered in the Western Woods... dazed... nearly blind from terror. \nLady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face. \nLADY VAN TASSEL And, tomorrow is my grand performance, having barely survived the elements... (more emoting) By sheer luck I found my way back to the Hollow.  But... what do I find here... ?  My dear, sweet step-daughter Katrina is dead.  Why has God forsaken her? \nSeeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina, Masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees. \nLADY VAN TASSEL (of herself, pleased) No one will suspect this sad woman who has been through such an ordeal.  With only the empty solace of her money and land to comfort her. \nEXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT \nIchabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch. \nICHABOD Katrina! \nEXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT \nICHABOD is HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished. \nKATRINA Murderer! \nKatrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the head, a glancing blow that knocks her down.  Katrina runs. \nKatrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up... \nBut, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws her back to the ground. \nLady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her forehead, bleeding, pissed. \nLADY VAN TASSEL You've been a naughty girl. \nYoung Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards. \nKatrina runs and pulls Masbath up.  They flee. \nKATRINA Ichabod! \nLady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Little bitch. \nEXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT \nIchabod comes out the open front doors... hearing... \nKATRINA (o.s.) (far away) Ichabod! \nIchabod climbs back on the coach, taking off. \nEXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT \nKatrina and Young Masbath run out from a line of trees. \nKATRINA Ichabod! \nYOUNG MASBATH Here we are! \nBEHIND IN THE FOREST, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse, in no hurry.  Wind kicks hard.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Run, Katrina!  Fast as your pretty legs will carry you.  It makes no difference. \nON THE LAWN, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath. \nBehind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the Horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Nothing will stop him now! \nAt mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath. \nICHABOD Climb up! \nYOUNG MASBATH Lady Van Tassel... \nICHABOD I know.  Hold on. \nICHABOD Go! \nIchabod takes the reins from Young Masbath. \nICHABOD Help her. \nReins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits.  The Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword. \nYoung Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the coach to the bridles, puts out his hand.  Katrina takes it. \nBehind, the Horseman swings.  Ichabod blocks with the saw. \nYoung Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse. Bareback.  Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her. \nThe Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back... \nIchabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear life.  His feet drag on the trail. \nAbove, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough to kill Katrina.  He raises his sword... \nKatrina screams, ducking, helpless... \nBelow, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod. \nHe shoves off with his feet. \nThe Horseman swings.... missing. \nThe horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along. \nThe coach careens out of control. \nIt flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off, throwing the Horseman. \nThe coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES. \nFURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop.  Young Masbath and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting, clutching his previously wounded shoulder. \nYOUNG MASBATH What now? \nICHABOD I doubt that's the end. \nKATRINA The church. \nICHABOD He moves too fast. \nIchabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail.  The trail behind is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD. \nKATRINA What was that? \nICHABOD His horse. \nThey start moving.  Ichabod looks around.  He sees... \nICHABOD There... \nThrough the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be seen against the sky.  Katrina and Young Masbath run. \nEXT. WINDMILL FIELD -- NIGHT \nIchabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area, heading to the windmill.  Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes. \nIchabod looks over his shoulder. \nHeavy, low hanging BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel. \nICHABOD He's coming! \nThe Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake. \nICHABOD Hurry! \nThe Horseman readies a battle axe. \nIchabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the ladder and in.  Katrina next. \nThe Horseman is almost there. \nIchabod follows Katrina.  He gets in, feet dangling.  The Horseman dismounts... \nINT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT \nIchabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door... slams it.  He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits. The door buckles. \nYOUNG MASBATH It won't hold. \nIchabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.  He struggles to roll it. \nYoung Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.  It falls on top with a thud.  The Horseman's sword jabs up through the grindstone's center hole. \nThe sword withdraws.  A POUNDING begins. \nEXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT \nThe Horseman chops at the door with his axe. \nINT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT \nPOUNDING CONTINUES.  The grindstone shifts.  Katrina and Young Masbath back away.  Ichabod holds his lantern up, desperate for ideas, searching. \nAbove, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is ground and bagged.  To the left is the crooked staircase. \nIchabod shepherds Katrina and Young Masbath to the edge where the rotors spin close. \nICHABOD The blades will carry us to the ground. Face front and wait for me. \nKATRINA I... I can't do this. \nICHABOD We have no choice. \nIchabod moves back to the trap door. \nKatrina and Young Masbath look at the rotors, and down at the long distance between them and the ground. \nICHABOD Be ready... \nIchabod throws the lantern into the windmill and runs. \nICHABOD Now! \nINT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT \nThe Horseman continues up.  The lantern falls past. \nEXT.  WINDMILL, ROOF -- NIGHT \nYoung Masbath jumps.  Ichabod grips Katrina and jumps... \nThey hit one rotor and cling to the frame and cloth.  The rotor begins its downwards swing. \nINT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT \nThe lantern hits the ground and shatters.  FLAMES EXPLODE! \nGrain dust is consumed instantaneously -- FLAMES ROAR upwards, filling the windmill... \nEngulfing the Horseman. \nEXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT \nThe rotor is halfway to its lowest point.  Masbath, Katrina and Ichabod hang on as the entire structure trembles. \nBOOM -- flames shoot out the windows, doors and seams, lighting up the night. \nOn the rattling rotor, Ichabod struggles to hold the frame with one hand and keep a grip on Katrina. \nMasbath drops.  Ichabod releases Katrina, then drops. \nThey hit the ground.  Ichabod rolls, gasping, holding his shoulder.  They all look at each other in disbelief a moment. Ichabod lets out a sort of rasping laugh, standing. \nICHABOD Okay... come on... \nIchabod ushers them across the field, uphill.  Running. Lightning flashes across the sky.  THUNDER RUMBLES. \nA bolt strikes the windmill, and it EXPLODES... \nSHOCKWAVE DEAFENING.  The rotors bust apart.  Splinters of burning wood spin all directions. \nACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath keep running.  There is a WOODEN CART parked ahead. \nIN THE WINDMILL RUBBLE, the Horseman rises, shoving off burning debris.  His flame-ravaged uniform smolders. \nACROSS THE FIELD, Ichabod stumbles onwards, but notices something horrible... \nIn the distance, Lady Van Tassel's white horse roams free. \nICHABOD (as this registers) Oh, no... \nYoung Masbath and Katrina are just past the cart when Lady Van Tassel rises from behind it, swings a plank... \nSLAMS Ichabod in the chest and sends him down. \nLady Van Tassel grabs Katrina's hair, drags her. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Should have stayed away, Constable. \nIchabod gets up slow, furious, reaches to his holster, only to find it empty.  He moves forward. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Keep back, or I kill her. \nShe takes out scissors, holds them to Katrina's neck. Katrina ceases struggling. \nIchabod keeps Masbath behind him, keeps his distance.  Lady Van Tassel shoots a glance... \nLADY VAN TASSEL See him... \nPar off, the Horseman strides from the wreckage. \nLADY VAN TASSEL You cannot kill what is already dead. \nICHABOD Let her go! \nLADY VAN TASSEL Yes... yes.  I think I will... \nLady Van Tassel spins and throws Katrina in the cart, shoving against it. \nICHABOD No! \nThe cart rolls downhill.  Ichabod moves forward. \nLady Van Tassel turns, brandishing the scissors, slashing and missing.  Ichabod backs off. \nDOWNHILL, the cart picks up speed, headed for the Horseman. \n", "test1_input": "No answer.  Killian arrives, nods solemnly. \nKILLIAN The Widow Windsor. \nICHABOD Is that all you say?  Look at her. \nKILLIAN It's not something people speak of openly.  She did not remarry. \nIchabod kneels, studying.  Now, WE SEE: the belly of the headless corpse is bulbous, because the Widow Windsor was very far along in a pregnancy. \nIchabod notices: a tear in the cloth of widow's blouse.  He reaches through the tear, feeling the stomach. \nHe straightens, greatly troubled. \nINT.  DOCTOR'S RESIDENCE, MEDICAL ROOM -- MORNING \nScissors cut open the widow's blouse.  There's an inch-long WOUND on the moldering belly; a sword puncture. \nIchabod examines the corpse on a table.  Lancaster watches, anxiously mopping his face.  Young Masbath's in a corner. Ichabod goes to write in his ledger full of notes. \nICHABOD What is the common thread between these victims? \nYOUNG MASBATH I'm sure I don't know. \nICHABOD We must discover it.  The reason the murderer chose these persons. \nIchabod goes to look at the widow's corpse, pondering. \nICHABOD The wounds are the same.  Cauterized. No chopping or half-measures either. One stroke took the head.  Have you seen, doctor... ? (pointing to it) Even the spinal bone... sliced as smooth as butter. \nDOCTOR LANCASTER I do not care.  You are welcome to use my work area, but I beg you... return her to her resting place. \nICHABOD In time, doctor.  Soon as I finish. \nIchabod picks up an iron knife.  He looks to Young Masbath. \nICHABOD You should step outside. \nEXT.  CHURCHYARD CEMETERY -- EARLY EVENING \nIchabod and others restore graves.  Ichabod looks to the church, where Clergyman Steenwyck stands in the door. \nFATHER STEENWYCK The devil sent you, Ichabod Crane. The Lord will not forgive your sins. \nSteenwyck shuts the creaky doors. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nIchabod sleeps, dreaming... \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- FARMLAND -- DAY \nA young BOY, 10, stands in a wheat field with his back to us. A FEMALE VOICE is HEARD FAINTLY, getting LOUDER. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Ichabod!  Ichabod... come along. \nThe boy, YOUNG ICHABOD, turns, smiling.  He runs.  We FOLLOW to a clearing behind a frontier home.  MOTHER waits.  Lovely woman.  She kisses him. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- YOUNG ICHABOD'S BEDROOM -- NIGHT \nDark.  Young Ichabod, in bed, has one eye open.  Across the room, Mother has her back to him.  She's WHISPERING something to no one.  She turns... \nYoung Ichabod pretends he is asleep. \nA DRAWER is HEARD SHUTTING.  Mother exits.  Ichabod gets up, curious, opens a drawer... finds something behind clothing. \nIt's a piece of reed grass, woven into an elaborate pattern with shafts of wheat twisted into the center.  Young Ichabod replaces it, closes the drawer. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- MARKET SQUARE -- DAY \nA busy, muddy street lined by wares and produce.  Young Ichabod walks with FATHER, an emotionless man.  Father stops to examine tools.  Young Ichabod stays by him, but something captures his attention... \nAcross the way, Mother is involved in a argument with a FREAKISH-LOOKING WOMAN.  They shout.  People stop to watch. Can't make out words, but Freakish Woman is furious. \nICHABOD'S DREAM -- STORM SKY -- NIGHT \nLIGHTNING flashes over tree tops.  THUNDER BOOMS. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nIchabod jerks awake in his bed. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nIchabod enters with a lantern and his ledger.  He sits, studies notes, then notices there's a light down the hall. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT \nOpposite an elaborate loom, Katrina reads by candlelight. She looks up, seeing Ichabod enter. \nICHABOD Sorry for disturbing you.  I thought a forgotten candle was burning. \nKatrina self-consciously closes her shabby book, puts it with another on her lap and covers them. \nKATRINA You do not disturb me.  Please stay. Having trouble sleeping? \nICHABOD May I ask... why do you cover your book that way? \nKATRINA You pay great attention to small things.  I hide these as I hide all my books.  Father would not approve, lest it were the Bible. \nICHABOD I, um... I have something to show you, if you have a moment. \n", "test1_true": "KATRINA These are strange... may I? \nShe takes his hand, spreads the fingers to the palm.  She touches the many evenly spaced scars. \nKATRINA These scars.  How did you get them? \nICHABOD I have had them since childhood.  I cannot remember what from. \nKATRINA It would be interesting to find out. \nTheir eyes meet.  Ichabod gets back to the ledger.  Katrina seems to relish the effect she has.  Ichabod finds a paper disk on string, illustrated thusly: \nICHABOD Here it is.  A bird on one side. His cage on the other.  Now, stare at it. (spinning it) The bird seems to be in his cage. \nKATRINA Yes, he does.  May I try? \nIchabod gives it.  She spins it, smiling. \nICHABOD He only appears to be inside the cage.  The point being... \nKATRINA You made this, and the drawings? \nICHABOD Yes, but listen.  The illusion is easily explained.  The eye retains each image, till they combine.  And yet, some would call this toy magic. \nKATRINA Don't you see why?  Look closely a moment.  Put your intellect aside. (spinning it) Can't you see what is inexplicable? \nIchabod watches it spin.  He shakes his head, unimpressed. \nKATRINA Oh, you are hopeless.  May I keep it at least? \nICHABOD If you want.  But... \nKATRINA Then, I also have a gift for you. True magic which even you will not be able to deny. \nShe hands him a book.  \"ROMEO AND JULIET.\"  Ichabod stands, offering it back, but she will not take it. \nICHABOD Thank you.  No.  Here... \nKATRINA I insist that you have it. \nICHABOD (resigned, leaving) Very well.  But, it will only sit gathering dust. \nKATRINA That would be a pity.  Those words might show you something you've never seen before. \nIchabod stops at the door, looks back.  He exits. \nEXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT \nA light glows in Ichabod's window.  LOOKING IN: Ichabod's in bed, fully dressed.  He sits up.  Pause.  He crosses to pick up \"Romeo and Juliet.\"  He begins to read. \nEXT.  PHILIPSE'S FARM -- DUSK \nIchabod walks with Philipse.  Young Masbath follows with the horses.  CICADAS CHATTER from a vast corn field. \nPHILIPSE Not more than a year ago, a mob hung a man for stealing a horse.  For stealing a horse!  And, you dig up our dead. \nICHABOD Are you saying I should be frightened? Is this a message passed on from Clergyman Steenwyck? \nThe CICADAS SUDDENLY go SILENT.  Young Masbath notices. \nPHILIPSE We are farmers here, not lawyers or bankers, or even constables.  Every penny we earn comes from what we send down the Hudson. \nICHABOD I know it. \nYOUNG MASBATH Um.... excuse me, sirs... \nPHILIPSE (still to Ichabod) Because of the Horseman, our migrant workers flee for their lives.  There is a danger that our crops will rot. So, if you are going to help us, you stop the Horseman.  That is your task... to kill an undead thing. \nYoung Masbath looks to a fenced grazing area, worried.  The sheep there are agitated, all running one direction away. \nICHABOD Listen to what you say.... \nPHILIPSE No, you listen!  You may think we are a pack of superstitious dullards... \nICHABOD At times I do. \nYOUNG MASBATH Sirs... please! \nPHILIPSE What will it take for you to realize this is no laughing matter? \nThe horses go crazy, braying and rearing.  The reins yank Young Masbath off his feet as the horses flee. \nIchabod and Philipse look to Masbath.  A SOUND is HEARD, distant: THUNDERING HOOFBEATS.  Wind kicks up.  HOOFBEATS seem to come FROM ALL DIRECTIONS. \nPhilipse looks to the corn field.  A flock of birds alights; a great sheet of black against the sky. \nPHILIPSE Oh my... oh my oh my oh my... \nPhilipse runs towards his house, past Masbath.  HOOFBEATS are LOUDER, CLOSER.  Ichabod faces the corn field. \nThe field explodes open, stalks bending to make way as the Headless Horseman gallops into view atop Daredevil. \nYoung Masbath runs, following Philipse. \nIchabod's stunned.  He looks down to draw his flintlock pistol, but the Horseman blows by before he can raise it.  A blast of air knocks Ichabod off his feet. \nThe Horseman chases Masbath and Philipse. \nIchabod follows. \nThe Horseman draws his sword. \n", "test1_id": 2796, "test2_input": "ICHABOD His next victim is chosen! (to Masbath) Give me distance, then guide her back to the Hollow. \nIchabod runs towards the horses. \nYOUNG MASBATH Constable! \nEXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- DAY \nThe Horseman rips past on Daredevil. \nEXT.  BEHIND IN WESTERN WOODS -- DAY \nIchabod rides as fast as Gunpowder is able. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nSmall home.  Killian, Thomas and Beth have finished supper. Beth clears plates as Killian picks his teeth with a knife. \nTHOMAS May I be excused, father? \nKILLIAN Do you deserve to be? \nTHIRD MAN (shyly) I think so. \nKILLIAN (smiles) Then, go. \nThomas gets down from his chair.  He goes to the fireplace to light a tallow wick, which he takes to the next room. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY \nThomas plops on the floor and lights his MAGIC LANTERN: a lantern with an outer sleeve of glass painted with silhouettes of lions and monsters. \nThomas turns the lantern and looks to the walls where the creatures, shadows are thrown.  He roars for them, imagining them real and having a grand time. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nBeth comes for more dishes. \nBETH Don't pick teeth.  You teach Thomas bad habits. \nKillian pulls her to him, playful. \nKILLIAN I am a bad habit.  There's nothing for it. \nBETH (kisses him) No one knows better than I. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY \nThomas continues his fun, shadow animals circling him. \nIn the shifting light, a baby spider comes from a crack in the wall.  Then, another spider skitters out.  More follow. \nEXT.  FORESTS -- DAY \nA black horse runs, hooves pounding the ground.  THUNDER is HEARD.  The horse slows and stops... it is Brom's horse, with Brom aboard.  Brom looks skyward. \nThe storm harshens, roaring through the trees.  Distant HOOFBEATS can be HEARD.  POUNDING. \nBrom takes his rifle off his shoulder.  The HOOFBEATS grow LOUDER and PASS, far away.  Brom turns in the saddle and WHISTLES.  He kicks his horse and rides. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY \nThomas still watches shadow beasts, but sees something else. He goes to the crack where hundreds of spiders flee all directions. Thomas is amused. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nBehind Killian, mantelpiece stones pulse, breathing almost imperceptibly.  Demonic faces form, then disappear and reform again, shifting.  WIND HOWLS. \nINT.

KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nThe ENTIRE HOUSE CREAKS.  Killian looks up.  CREAKING STOPS. The HOWLING WIND is LOUD. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY \nBeth comes to Thomas' side as he points. \nTHOMAS Spiders. \nBeth bends to see the swarming spiders.  She looks up, noticing the FEROCITY of the WIND. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nKillian stands, looking up.  The HOUSE CREAKS again, then suddenly the WIND CEASES.  Silence. \nKILLIAN Beth... \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY \nBeth picks up Thomas.  The magic lantern creatures begin spinning anew, all around. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nWith a ROAR, the fire flares.  Killian looks. \n", "test2_true": "Behind Killian, the DOOR SPLINTERS INWARDS.  The Horseman steps in, a battle axe in each hand.  WIND BLASTS... \nThe DOOR to the other room SLAMS. \nKillian grabs a kitchen chair and hurls it at the Horseman. The Horseman swings, smashing it aside. \nKILLIAN Beth... run! \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY \nBeth hugs Thomas to her as she backs away. \nKILLIAN (o.s.) (from kitchen) Get out! \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nKillian grabs an iron skewer from the fireplace, swings it to fend off a blow from the Horseman. \nThe Horseman swings the other axe.  Killian ducks.  The axe cracks fireplace stone, throwing sparks. \nKillian lunges, jamming the skewer into the Horseman. \nThe skewer comes through the Horseman's back.  The Horseman swipes with the flat of one axe -- pounding Killian aside. \nKillian hits the wall, bashing his head.  Hits the floor. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY \nBeth kicks a carpet to reveal a trap door. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nThe Horseman pulls the skewer out of his body, throws it.  He goes to lift Killian by the hair with one hand, brings back the axe in the other... \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, WHITE ROOM -- DAY \nAt the trap door, Beth lowers Thomas to stairs leading to the cellar.  Thomas is crying. \nBETH Don't let him get you. \nTHOMAS Mommy... \nBETH You hide now... go... \nBeth closes the trap door, frantically replacing the carpet. The room's door flies open and the Horseman strides in, carrying Killian's severed head.  Beth shrieks. \nThe Horseman steps forward, knocks over the magic lantern. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY \nBeth's SCREAMS are abruptly CUT OFF.  Her BODY is HEARD HITTING the floor above.  Thomas crosses the cellar, stumbles.  He scurries into the shelter of a wheelbarrow propped against the wall.  FOOTSTEPS are HEARD. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, THE WHITE ROOM -- DAY \nThe Horseman's hands place Killian's and Beth's heads in a sack, cinching the sack shut. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nThe Headless Horseman enters, bends to retrieve the battle axe he left.  He stands.  Pause. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY \nThomas' trembling hands pull the wheelbarrow closer.  QUIET. He tries to control his sobbing. \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, KITCHEN -- DAY \nThe Horseman turns, falls to his knees.  He starts to chop at the floor with both axes.  CHOPping,  CHOPping,  CHOPping... making quick work of it... \nINT.  KILLIAN'S HOME, CELLAR -- DAY \nA hole appears in the ceiling as debris falls. \nThomas looks up, terrified.  He gets up to run away... \nThe Horseman's arm shoves through above, grasping Thomas and yanking him up. \nEXT.  KILLIAN'S FARM -- DAY \nBrom rides from the forest, charging across Killian's field. \nAt Killian's house, Daredevil rides up as the Headless Horseman walks out with his sack of heads.  The Horseman ties the sack to the saddle and leaps up. \nBrom puts his reins in his mouth, raising his rifle. \nThe Horseman heads away, past the barn, as Brom gains. \nBrom aims... FIRES! \nBOOM -- the slug EXPLODES, blowing the Horseman off Daredevil.  Daredevil keeps going.  The Horseman's smoldering body is left \"face down.\" \nBrom halts his horse.  He climbs down, pleased. \nThe Horseman moves. \nBrom backs away, satisfaction diminishing. \nThe Horseman gets on his knees. \nBrom falls to one knee, begins reloading.  He fills the gun from his powder horn. \nThe Horseman stands, unsheathes his sword and turns.

ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT \nIchabod takes off his hat, sets it on the seat.  The window between him and the driver slides open. \nVAN RIPPER Sir... this is yours. (offering something) The Van Tassel girl said to give it to you after you were gone. \nIchabod takes it.  It is the bird/cage spinning toy.  He studies it.  What melancholy. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, DINING ROOM -- NIGHT \nKatrina sits with her eyes closed.  A BOARD is HEARD CREAKING.  She sits up. Suddenly, a FIGURE in black is behind her as she turns.  WHACK! -- a gloved fist strikes. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nA dull THUD is HEARD downstairs, like a body falling.  Young Masbath takes notice.  He moves to the door... \nINT.  ICHABOD'S COACH -- NIGHT \nIchabod turns the strings on the bird/cage toy, ponders it. \nThe paper disk spins, images flickering until the bird appears to be inside the cage. \nIchabod keeps spinning it, looks out the window. \nA tear rolls down his cheek. \nThe bird cage toy's rotation slows... stops. \nIchabod looks at it a long moment, then pockets it and leans forward to the window at front. \nOUTSIDE THE COACH \nIchabod's face appears behind Van Ripper. \nICHABOD Van Ripper, turn the coach about! \nVAN RIPPER What did you say? \nICHABOD Turn around.

There are two coffins on the floor. \nICHABOD I never examined these bodies. \nIchabod removes the lid from one coffin.  Lancaster is about to say something indignant, but then just looks disgusted. \nDOCTOR LANCASTER ... help yourself, you pompous ass. I will be in bed. \nICHABOD Would you stay, doctor?  I may need assistance. \nLancaster reluctantly remains.  Ichabod stares at the dead Lady Van Tassel.  The neck wound is covered by a stained brown cloth, which Ichabod unwraps. \nICHABOD Stains of blood. \nDOCTOR LANCASTER What of it? \nIchabod takes out one of the lenses that survived the magnification spectacles, bends to examine the neck. \nICHABOD Jagged flesh.

Hold this just so... \n", "test3_true": "THROUGH THE LENS: the gash spreads easily, soft, bloodless. \nICHABOD No clotting or gathering of pus.

Lady Van Tassel has faked her death.  I need able men... \nHUGE FARMER She's dead, and you have gone mad. \nICHABOD No... \nHUGE FARMER (steps forward) Get out!

FOREST -- NIGHT \nIn a wooded area, Katrina lies unconscious.  Gloved hands reach to her hair and cut off a clump with SCISSORS. \nA conjuring pile has been made, containing a small animal's heart with an iron nail through it.  Katrina's hair is added and the pile is lit to burn. \nNearby, Young Masbath watches, on his belly with his hands tied behind his back. \nLady Van Tassel whispers over the fire, her white horse tied nearby.  She looks to Katrina, who stirs. \nLady Van Tassel takes the Horseman's skull from a bag over her shoulder, places the skull in the flames.  THUNDER is HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel looks up, smiles. \nEXT.  WESTERN WOODS, TREE OF THE DEAD -- NIGHT \nThe wind tosses leaves in swirls.  The twisted tree opens wide, with a RUMBLE -- shafts of light shooting out. \nEXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT \nIchabod drives the coach hard ahead. \nEXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT \nKatrina sits up, groggy.  Lady Van Tassel looks down at her. \nKATRINA You... you are alive. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Am I?  Or, are you and Young Masbath dead along with me? \nKatrina sees Young Masbath, and beyond him, the dying fire. \nYOUNG MASBATH She commands the Horseman. \nLADY VAN TASSEL And, quite beautifully done, wouldn't you say?  It is almost over. \nTHUNDER again.  Wind starts to pick up. \nLADY VAN TASSEL (of the wind) He rides tonight. \nKATRINA Father saw you die. \nLADY VAN TASSEL He saw me thrown... saw the Horseman looming over me as I fled.  Things I wanted him to see.  But, as long as I govern the Horseman, he cannot harm me.  Baltus did not stay enough to see that.  He ran as a coward, unfettered by my fate. \nYOUNG MASBATH Then, whose body was it... ? \nLADY VAN TASSEL The precious servant girl Sarah.  I killed her and kept her body hidden, till I needed it.  And, when I return to the Hollow tomorrow, my version of the truth will come to pass. (faking meekness) I mean, there I was that fateful day, following Baltus into the woods.  I did not know what he was up to... where he was going.  I worried for his safety. \n", "test3_id": 2798}

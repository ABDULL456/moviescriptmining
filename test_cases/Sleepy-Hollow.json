{"test1_input": "They move to a second door, quietly.  Ichabod makes another low wax mark. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, MAIN ENTRANCE -- NIGHT \nIchabod and Masbath come downstairs to a hall.  Ichabod continues his wax marking at each door. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, BALTUS' OFFICE -- NIGHT \nIchabod and Young Masbath enter, shutting the door.  Ichabod walks to shelves at Baltus' desk, looks through ribbon bound DOCUMENTS and hands some to Masbath. \nYoung Masbath pulls off the ribbon, pages through these \"LOAN AGREEMENT\" parchments.  Ichabod brings another pile. \nICHABOD (whispering) They are alphabetical. \nYoung Masbath has the M's.  \"MARYIE,\" \"MEGAPOLENISIS,\" AND \"MELYN...\" Not finding what he wants. \nYOUNG MASBATH There is no Masbath here.  My father's loan papers are missing. \nICHABOD (regarding his documents) There are none for Magistrate Philipse either.  \"Paasch, James\" \"Pieter, Thomas\" \"Pos, William.\" \nA FLOORBOARD CREAKS.  Ichabod looks, blows out the lantern. He and Young Masbath stand frozen. \nAcross the room, light comes under the door, stops, then continues.  A DOOR is HEARD OPENING and SHUTTING.  Ichabod crosses to follow, pointing back. \nICHABOD Keep looking.  Then, hide in my room and bolt the door till I return. \nEXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT \nLantern light moves, far ahead.  Ichabod follows. \nEXT.  FOREST, FURTHER ON -- NIGHT \nIchabod stops, hidden.  He can see the light ahead, but it is no longer in motion.  He advances. \nEXT.  FOREST CLEARING -- NIGHT \nA lantern sits on a rock.  On a blanket, a semi-naked MAN and semi-naked WOMAN are in the midst of rough SEX. \nIchabod crawls to peer from underbrush. \nThe couple keeps coupling, with the man on top.  His grunts and gasps are particularly desperate.  He's all over the woman, who lays back... it is Lady van Tassel. \nIchabod swallows, inches closer. \nLady van Tassel pulls the man's shirt, exposes his flesh. She raises a small, sharp KNIFE behind his back. \nIchabod's eyes widen. \nLady Van Tassel brings the blade to her own hand, slicing deep in her palm.  Blood flows.  She rubs her cut hand over her partner's arching back, smearing blood. \nLady van Tassel caresses the man's chest, neck, face... trailing blood.  The man lifts his head, in ecstasy, sucks the woman's bloody fingers... it's Clergyman Steenwyck. \nIchabod backs away, having seen more than plenty. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, ICHABOD'S ROOM -- NIGHT \nYoung Masbath unlocks the door.  Ichabod enters. \nYOUNG MASBATH I was getting worried.  Who was it? \nICHABOD Lady Van Tassel. \nYOUNG MASBATH What was she doing? \nICHABOD Something I really wish I had not seen. Never mind it.  Did you find the victims' loan agreements? \nYOUNG MASBATH No.  They are all missing. \nThis troubles Ichabod. \nYOUNG MASBATH There is more, though.  While you were gone, I could hear someone else walking through the house. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, UPSTAIRS HALLWAY -- NIGHT \nIchabod and Young Masbath creep round a corner.  Going to the LAST DOOR, Ichabod crouches, eyes narrowing... \nICHABOD (whispers, to himself) Katrina. \nThe wax seal is broken, flecks of wax on the floor. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, FOYER AND HALL -- NIGHT \nIchabod and Masbath come downstairs, checking all the wax marks.  Young Masbath finds one broken. \nYOUNG MASBATH Here. \nIchabod comes over, pushes the door... \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- NIGHT \nThey enter.  The kitchen is empty.  Ichabod crosses to another door, crouches.  Another broken wax mark. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- NIGHT \nThey enter... the room with the elaborate loom.  Ichabod moves his lantern to make a quick search, goes to table. \nHe touches the top of a candle.  His finger comes away with a bit of still wet wax. \nYOUNG MASBATH There are no other doors.  This is as far as she could have gone. \nICHABOD It is nothing.  She comes to read books, so her father will not find her. (to convince himself) It is absolutely nothing. \n", "test1_true": "ICHABOD Fiction plays and novels.  Baltus does not approve.  Now, come.  It may not be long before Lady Van Tassel returns. \nYOUNG MASBATH But, sir... what books?  Where are they? \nIchabod stops, looking around.  No books anywhere. \nYOUNG MASBATH If there is a secret place for books... it could be just as good for the missing loan agreements. \nIchabod ponders this without saying anything. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, SEWING ROOM -- LATER NIGHT \nSEARCH MONTAGE: \n- Drawers are opened and searched, quietly. - Young Masbath uses a candle to look up the fireplace. - Ichabod opens a linen cabinet, unfolding blankets. - Young Masbath looks in a closet filled with big spools of sewing thread, on his knees, pulls a wooden box forward. Inside it, he finds only old cups and silverware. \nIchabod pulls up a rug, feeling along the floorboards. \nYoung Masbath crawls, doing the same.  He climbs under the loom, tapping on the floor.  TAP... TAP... TAP... \nHe crawls further under the loom.  TAP... TAP... PLONK.  A hollow sound.  He taps again... PLONK... PLONK. \nYOUNG MASBATH Constable. \nIchabod comes over as Young Masbath lifts a loose board. Under the floor, there are piles of books.  Masbath brings them up, handing them to Ichabod, who studies the spines. \nYoung Masbath reaches in up to his shoulder.  He comes up with \"LOAN AGREEMENTS.\" \nYOUNG MASBATH Fie!  Here they are. \nIchabod takes them.  Names are near the top: \"Masbath,\" \"Van Garret,\" \"Philipse,\" and \"Killian.\" \nIchabod sits back, numb, his heart bitterly broken. \nINT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE, KITCHEN -- MORNING \nLady Van Tassel prepares food with two servants at the open fireplace/oven.  Ichabod enters, rushed. \nICHABOD Excuse me, Lady Van Tassel... Katrina is not in her room. \nLADY VAN TASSEL No.  She has gone out. \nICHABOD Where? \nLADY VAN TASSEL She has taken the last of our grain to be milled. (crossing to him) You do have a background in the medical arts, don't you, Constable? \nICHABOD Very little.  I must be going... \nLady Van Tassel holds out her cut palm, the gash sewn shut. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Will you look at this?  I cut my hand this morning: I sewed it myself, but I am afraid it will go bad. \nIchabod takes her hand, distracted and nervous. \nICHABOD It appears well.  It has already clotted. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Look closer.  Do you have anything to clean it with? \nICHABOD It is fine.  Now, I must... \nLady Van Tassel grabs Ichabod by the wrist, tight. \nLADY VAN TASSEL (whispering, close) I know you saw me. \nICHABOD What... ? \nLady Van Tassel glances to servants, keeps her voice low. \nLADY VAN TASSEL I know you followed last night.  You must promise not to tell Baltus... \nIchabod tries to pull away, but she grips tighter.  The FRONT DOOR is HEARD SLAMMING.  Ichabod is panicky. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Have mercy on me.  Please... have mercy. \nIchabod pulls away just as Baltus enters.  Lady Van Tassel goes back to work as if nothing happened. \nBALTUS Constable, it is urgent that we speak. \nEXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE FRONT PORCH -- MORNING \nBaltus leads Ichabod to the porch. \nBALTUS Clergyman Steenwyck is calling a meeting.  This time he is determined to have you forced out, or worse. \nICHABOD How did you hear this? \nBALTUS He came to me.  He promised great violence.  Said I should cast you out for my own protection. (troubled pause) I must speak honestly.  There is no reason to think he will not meet with success. \nIchabod looks to barn, sees Masbath bringing the horses.  The CHURCH BELL is HEARD TOLLING far away. \nBALTUS That is the meeting bell already calling.  With the murder of Killian and Brom, no one sees any good from you.  If... if you were to leave... you might be saving your own life. \nIchabod studies Baltus, then offers his hand.  They shake. \nICHABOD I appreciate your concern.  I thank you, sir. \nIchabod hurries off, across the lawn, exasperated.  He runs. Masbath runs to him.  Ichabod takes Gunpowder and climbs up. \nYOUNG MASBATH (mounting his horse) What now?  Where is she? \nICHABOD Things have become complicated. Katrina is at the mill.  Ride ahead, find her and bring her to meet me outside the church.  Find her at all costs.  Quickly. \n", "test1_id": 2796, "test2_input": "They ride, fast. \nEXT.  FOREST -- DAY \nA conjuring pile of straw burns.  Gloved hands unfold a paper filled with clippings of human hair.  The hair is sprinkled on the fire. \nA cloaked FIGURE is kneeled at the pile.  The figure turns to remove A human SKULL from a cloth bag. \nThe skull is placed at center in the flames.  It's teeth are sharp, cut to points.  The HORSEMAN'S SKULL. \nEXT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nIn the church yard refugee camp, food is prepared over fire. People inhabit the tents. \nINT.  CHURCH, STEENWYCK'S QUARTERS -- MORNING \nIN THE CHURCH: it's crowded with families.  Pews filled with bedding and belongings.  Steenwyck comes to CLOSE the DOUBLE DOORS of his quarters, turning, angry. \nFATHER STEENWYCK You are astonishing, Constable.  Do you truly think your ridiculous accusations frighten me? \nIchabod is doing nothing to hide his disdain. \nICHABOD Only if I repeat them outside this room.  And, I will if I must... (points to doors) Out there, for all to hear.  Or... you may speak, as planned.  But, you tell them you feel compelled to move on to greener pastures. \nFATHER STEENWYCK No.  You will not run me out.  No one will believe a word of what you say. \nICHABOD Oh?  Far as I can tell, a rumor does not travel alone for long here. \nFATHER STEENWYCK Are you a deist?  Is that it?  A free thinker who does not believe in divinity. \nICHABOD It is only important what you are. An adulterer... \nFATHER STEENWYCK I am the Lord's voice in this town. \nICHABOD Wallowing in sin and lust... \nFATHER STEENWYCK They need guidance. \nICHABOD Wallowing quite literally in blood. \nFATHER STEENWYCK (snapping, quaking) Damn you, sir!  God damn you to hell! \nICHABOD He may.  But, not soon enough for you, and not on your behalf. \nIchabod walks.  Steenwyck is humiliated. \nICHABOD You are so upset now... and yet, you seemed in such good spirits last night. \nFATHER STEENWYCK You cannot do this.  I am a man of God! \nICHABOD Climb to the top of the tallest ladder you can find, Father.  That is the closest you ever come to God. \nINT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nPews are packed.  Steenwyck enters, walks to the altar. EVERYONE QUIETS.  Steenwyck has composed himself, barely. \nFATHER STEENWYCK My friends... dear friends.  Those of you still on your farms, I thank you for coming. \nHe sees Ichabod near the back.  THUNDER is HEARD OUTSIDE. \nFATHER STEENWYCK I... I address unfortunate business. (pause) I am forced to take my leave from Sleepy Hollow.  I will be moving on to do the Lord's work elsewhere. \nThe GATHERERS MURMUR shock.  Ichabod walks out. \nEXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- DAY \nRaining hard.  Baltus and Lady Van Tassel ride. \nBALTUS Hurry along.  The meeting has most certainly already begun.  We do not want Steenwyck as our enemy. \nLady Van Tassel trails.  WOOD is HEARD SPLINTERING... \nJust off the road, a tree falls... \nThe trunk catches Lady Van Tassel's horse on its rear flank. \nThe horse falls.  Lady Van Tassel hits the dirt. \nBaltus looks back, halting. \nLady Van Tassel looks up to Baltus in fear, then turns. \nBehind her, the Headless Horseman trots from, the forest on Daredevil, stops.  Calm.  He takes his axe in hand. \nEXT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nStorming.  The meeting is letting out.  Near the churchyard gate, Young Masbath rides with Katrina following on a horse cart.  Ichabod walks up as Katrina dismounts. \nKATRINA What is so urgent? \nICHABOD Come with me. \nIchabod leads her to where they can talk away from others. \nKATRINA Why have I not seen your face for so long?  You look much better. \nShe touches his face, but he takes her hand, places the loan agreements there. \nICHABOD Explain these.  I found them secreted away in the sewing room. \nKatrina's expression changes just so slightly to guilt. \n", "test2_true": "He stares at her.  Katrina stares back, in a small way defeated.  She looks for an out, but there is none. \nKATRINA I have been reading your journal. I'm sorry.  I found it too fascinating to resist. (pause, ashamed) I rode to catch up with you at the Notary, out of curiosity.  Before I found you though, I overheard what you were said. \nICHABOD It was you there? \nKATRINA When... when you spoke father's name along with accusations, I could not believe it.  I had to hide these... at least till I could confront him myself. \nICHABOD And, what did he say? \nKATRINA He did not do these things.  If you knew him, you would realize... \nICHABOD What did he say, Katrina? \nKATRINA I have not been able to face him yet. \nICHABOD The loans give the land to your father. It does not matter survivors are still on their farms.  They could be thrown off... tomorrow... a year from now. \nKATRINA Yes, I have seen that, and I told you why I hid them. \nICHABOD What would you have me believe? \nKATRINA (tiring, angry) If you think I am behind this, say it. \nICHABOD The name Van Tassel is blackened.  You share that name. \nKATRINA Call me a liar, then, and a murderess. Say it, out and out. \nMany people are starting to notice the confrontation. \nICHABOD Katrina... \nKATRINA Speak the words, Constable.  What is stopping you?  What has happened to your ability to transcend sentimentality? \nEmotions tear at him.  Rain seems to pound down harder. \nKATRINA Oh, no.  No.  Please... don't dare stand looking as if you still care for me, after all that you have said.  If I were to confess, would that ease your suffering?  Would that make it easier for you to hate me?! \nA TORTURED CRY is HEARD O.S. \nBaltus comes charging through the square on his horse. \nBALTUS The Horseman is coming! \nHe's barely hanging on.  He stops, practically falling off, running towards Katrina and Ichabod. \nBALTUS Save me... \nKATRINA Father? \nBALTUS He killed her... \nBaltus grasps Katrina, fearful.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD. \nBALTUS The Horseman has killed her. \nFar behind, the Horseman rides to follow, axe held up. Instant mayhem -- people scatter all directions, screaming. \nBaltus runs headlong to the church. \nKATRINA Father! \nKatrina runs after Baltus.  Ichabod backs away, watching the Horseman come, then heads to the church with Masbath. \nBaltus pushes through the iron gate, into tent city, joining the swarm of townsfolk pouring into the church. \nThe Horseman rides behind, closing the gap.  Men, women and children run for cover all along the square. \nAmidst the churchyard panic, Ichabod looks back... \nThe Horseman reaches the open gate and Daredevil suddenly rears up, snorting, unwilling to enter. \nThe Horseman grabs Daredevil's reins, tries to move forward again.  Same result.  Daredevil freaks out. \nINT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nBaltus makes his way in, shoving.  People are still clamoring in through the doors. \nMen pass rifles from stockpiles and climb onto pews at boarded windows.  Women herd children into a cellar. \nBaltus searches for a hiding place.  He looks across the church to see Steenwyck closing the doors of his living quarters.  Baltus moves... \nBALTUS Steenwyck! \nAt the front doors, Katrina squeezes in with Ichabod and Young Masbath just as people are forcing the doors closed. It's madness.  People outside begin pounding. \nKatrina searches. \nKATRINA Father! \nIchabod goes to a window, looking out between boards. \nEXT.  CHURCH -- DAY \nAcross the yard, the Horseman gives his axe an underhand toss to the ground inside the gate. \nThe AXE instantly BEGINS TO DEGRADE TO DUST in the rain. \nThe Horseman rides, keeping outside the fence. \nINT.  CHURCH -- DAY \n", "test2_id": 2797, "test3_input": "Katrina cautiously moves the hand she's supporting herself with, feels a rock and clutches it. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Imagine my surprise, finding him on a liason with a common servant.  A girl who had apparently become his secret love. \nKATRINA No one will believe your lies, whore. \nLADY VAN TASSEL This whore will see your mouth shut forever very soon.  But... I am not going to kill you.  Not me... \nShe picks up the Horseman's skull in her gloved hand. \nLADY VAN TASSEL He will have that honor. \nEXT.  WESTERN WOODS -- NIGHT \nThe Horseman rides Daredevil, a freight train of moldering flesh, heading towards a chasm with no bridge. \nThey reach it, galloping in mid-air to the other side. \nEXT.  LONG STRAIGHT ROAD/VAN TASSEL ESTATE -- NIGHT \nIchabod guides the coach into the Van Tassel orchard. \nEXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT \nLady Van Tassel admires the skull. \nLADY VAN TASSEL (mock sorrow) Woe is me... that spying on my husband in his filthy indiscretion, I saw he and Sarah attacked by the Horseman. Oh pity me... so overcome was I that I wandered in the Western Woods... dazed... nearly blind from terror. \nLady Van Tassel crouches, rubbing dirt on her face. \nLADY VAN TASSEL And, tomorrow is my grand performance, having barely survived the elements... (more emoting) By sheer luck I found my way back to the Hollow.  But... what do I find here... ?  My dear, sweet step-daughter Katrina is dead.  Why has God forsaken her? \nSeeing that Lady Van Tassel lavish attention on Katrina, Masbath takes this opportunity to ease onto his knees. \nLADY VAN TASSEL (of herself, pleased) No one will suspect this sad woman who has been through such an ordeal.  With only the empty solace of her money and land to comfort her. \nEXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT \nIchabod leaps from the coach, bounds up the porch. \nICHABOD Katrina! \nEXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT \nICHABOD is HEARD.  Lady Van Tassel turns, astonished. \nKATRINA Murderer! \nKatrina slings the rock -- strikes Lady Van Tassel in the head, a glancing blow that knocks her down.  Katrina runs. \nKatrina grips Young Masbath, helping him up... \nBut, Lady Van Tassel scrambles up, grabs Katrina and throws her back to the ground. \nLady Van Tassel steps hard on Katrina's ankle, touches her forehead, bleeding, pissed. \nLADY VAN TASSEL You've been a naughty girl. \nYoung Masbath leaps to action, charging head first -- slams into Lady Van Tassel, sends her backwards. \nKatrina runs and pulls Masbath up.  They flee. \nKATRINA Ichabod! \nLady Van Tassel rolls, recovering, not very concerned. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Little bitch. \nEXT.  VAN TASSEL HOUSE -- NIGHT \nIchabod comes out the open front doors... hearing... \nKATRINA (o.s.) (far away) Ichabod! \nIchabod climbs back on the coach, taking off. \nEXT.  FOREST -- NIGHT \nKatrina and Young Masbath run out from a line of trees. \nKATRINA Ichabod! \nYOUNG MASBATH Here we are! \nBEHIND IN THE FOREST, Lady Van Tassel rides her white horse, in no hurry.  Wind kicks hard.  HOOFBEATS are HEARD. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Run, Katrina!  Fast as your pretty legs will carry you.  It makes no difference. \nON THE LAWN, Ichabod drives towards Katrina and Masbath. \nBehind, at the tree line, Lady Van Tassel holds up the Horseman's skull, wind tossing her dress and hair. \nLADY VAN TASSEL Nothing will stop him now! \nAt mid-field, Ichabod reaches Katrina and Masbath. \nICHABOD Climb up! \nYOUNG MASBATH Lady Van Tassel... \nICHABOD I know.  Hold on. \n", "test3_true": "LADY VAN TASSEL Olly-olly oxen-free! \nIchabod looks back towards Lady Van Tassel. \nAt the treeline, the Horseman breaks into the open, hell on horseback.  Full speed ahead. \nICHABOD Christ. \nEXT.  THE LONG STRAIGHT ROAD -- NIGHT \nThe coach hits the long straight road, away from the house. \nKatrina and Masbath hold on as the coach shakes violently. \nKATRINA Where are we going? \nICHABOD I do not know.  Away. \nYOUNG MASBATH Here he comes! \nBehind, the Horseman can be seen on the forest bordered road. Closing fast.  Breakneck pace. \nICHABOD We might make it to the church. \nMasbath takes a lantern, crawls back to the roof. \nKATRINA Masbath... ! \nHe ignores, reaching the rear of the coach and throwing the lantern at the Horseman.  It smashes on the trail. \nICHABOD Damn it, boy, get back here! \nYoung Masbath slides back.  Katrina helps him. \nYOUNG MASBATH What can we do? \nICHABOD Take the reins. \nYoung Masbath takes them.  Ichabod slings Van Ripper's rifle over his shoulder and starts back.  Katrina grips him. \nICHABOD Masbath is right.  We must do something. \nShe releases.  Ichabod gets to the luggage area at the rear, struggling to open a storage box. \nBehind, the Horseman draws his sword, closer. \nIchabod opens the box, hefting out a long, jagged SAW. \nKATRINA Ichabod! \nIchabod looks.  The Horseman rides up, swinging... \nIchabod recoils -- THWACK -- just missed by sword. \nThe Horseman lets the coach get ahead, shifting to the other side of the trail... coming along side. \nIchabod backpedals, looking to Masbath. \nICHABOD Keep him off!  Block him! \nMasbath guides the horses over.  The Horseman must fall behind to avoid the wheels. \nThe coach hits a large, fallen tree trunk. \nIchabod bounces, falling... \nHe hangs off the side of the coach. \nKatrina climbs to offer her hand.  Ichabod offers the saw. \nICHABOD Take it! \nKatrina takes the saw.  Now with both hands, Ichabod tries for better purchase.  He grips the coach door.  It opens... \nIchabod clings to the open door as branches slam him. \nHe's reaching to the coach threshold, reaching... \nIchabod pulls himself inside. \nBOOM -- the door hits a tree trunk, bashed to pieces. \nIchabod looks out from the coach, dazed.  He climbs. \nKatrina looks back as Young Masbath guides the coach to block the Horseman again. \nThe Horseman sheaths his sword, riding... reaching to grip the back corner of the coach. \nThe Horseman dismounts, clinging, climbing... \nIchabod takes the rifle off his shoulder, aiming... \nBANG! -- splattering the Horseman's hand point blank.  The Horseman hangs on with his other hand. \nThe Horseman re-grips with the blasted hand, amazing since it's now all mush and bone. \nIchabod throws the rifle on his way to the driver's perch, taking the saw from Katrina. \nICHABOD Move forward! \nKatrina looks to the horses, then at Ichabod. \n", "test3_id": 2798}

FERGUS What the fuck do you know, Jude? 
She pulls a gun and sticks it between his teeth. 
JUDE You fucking tell me, boy -- 
Fergus stares at her. Then says quietly: 
FERGUS She's nobody. She likes me. 
JUDE So I suppose a fuck is out of the question. Keep your head down, Fergus. No sudden moves. And not a whisper to her. You'll be hearing from us. 
She kisses him briefly, with the gun at his temple. 
JUDE Keep the faith. 
She goes. Fergus stands in the darkness. 
EXT. HAIR SALON - EVENING. 
Fergus, walking toward the hair salon, flowers in his hand. 
He stands outside watching, the flowers behind his back. Then the chair turns and we see it is Jude. 
Fergus freezes. He sees Jude looking at him, smiling brightly, then talking back to Dil 
INT. HAIR SALON - EVENING. 
JUDE He your boyfriend? 
Jude, turning in the chair. 
JUDE Lucky you.

FERGUS What? 
DIL He'd bring me carnations. 
FERGUS So I got it wrong, then. 
DIL Not at all, honey. 
FERGUS Don't. 
DIL Okay. 
She smiles brightly at something behind Fergus. He turns and sees Jude is there. Fergus stands, suddenly. 
He throws some money on the table, grabs her arm, and frog- marches her out. 
FERGUS Come on. 
DIL Why, honey -- 
FERGUS Come on. 
DIL You gonna tell me why? 
FERGUS No. 
As they pass Jude, she smiles. 
EXT. INDIAN RESTAURANT - NIGHT. 
Outside the restaurant. Fergus marches Dil away. 
DIL What's wrong, Jimmy? Tell me what's wrong 
FERGUS Not here. 
They pass out of shot. In the background we see Jude rising. 
INT. METRO - NIGHT. 
Dil and Fergus making their way to their seats at the bar.

A figure sitting down at the bar. It is Jude.

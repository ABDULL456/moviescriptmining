SEDAN - DAY \nHarry is eating a burrito and sipping coffee. \nHARRY Whose is the car? \nVALENTIN Mine. \nHARRY Nah.  You're driving it too carefully. \nVALENTIN (sparring) Maybe I just bought it. \nHARRY Somebody's been smoking in here for months. \nHe pulls open the ashtray. Pulls out a cigar-butt. \nHARRY Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is? \nVALENTIN (laughs) You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. (a beat) I work for the best illusionist in the world. \nHARRY Philip Swann? \nVALENTIN You know of him? \nHARRY I saw him in Vegas once. \nVALENTIN Are you a gambling man? \nHARRY When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician. \nVALENTIN Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist. \nHARRY What's the difference? \nVALENTIN Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - GATES - DAY \nThe sedan turns into a driveway. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY \nThe sun beats down on a pristine panorama of palms and white marble tombs.  Harry and Valentin walk towards a large mausoleum. \nHARRY Any movie stars buried here? \nVALENTIN Probably. \nHARRY It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view. \nVALENTIN I don't think the dead much care. \nHARRY Are you sure? \nVALENTIN Are you a believer, then? \nValentin gives him an inquisitive look. \nHARRY I've signed on for them all in my time.  Hindu.  Catholic. You can't have too many saviours. \nHarry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman in white standing in its cool shadows:  Dorothea Swann.  She wears a wide-brimmed hat. \nHARRY Who is she? \nVALENTIN Swann's wife. \nCUT TO: \nVALENTIN sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book.  He glances up. \nHarry and Dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in conversation. \nDOROTHEA I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered. \nHARRY Did your husband know Quaid? \nDOROTHEA Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards. \nHARRY You don't? \nDOROTHEA I think we make our own futures. \nHarry makes an approving MURMUR. \nHARRY What's the connection? \nDOROTHEA (covering now, but well) I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past. \n", "test1_true": "Dorothea stops talking.  Takes off her sunglasses.  Her gaze is troubled, but direct.  There is an attraction between the two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue. \nDOROTHEA He's a secretive man. \nHARRY And you don't ask questions? \nDOROTHEA We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do. \nHARRY Does that mean...? \nDOROTHEA We haven't slept in the same bed for years. \nHARRY But obviously you still care what happens to him. \nDOROTHEA We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive. \nHarry, frowns. \nDOROTHEA You don't believe me. \nHARRY He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery. \nDorothea stares at him. \nHARRY Sorry.  You asked. \nDOROTHEA No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money, \nHARRY Where do I sign? \nDorothea LAUGHS lightly. \nDOROTHEA Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour? \nHARRY Harry. \nDOROTHEA Harry. \nHARRY I'm no bodyguard. \nDOROTHEA That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening. \nHARRY When do you want me to start? \nDOROTHEA Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him. \nHARRY Do you? \nThe question catches Dorothea off guard. \nDOROTHEA I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight? \nHARRY Sure. \nDorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.  Harry watches her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her departing figure. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Get your ass back to Mew York. \nHARRY No.  I'm taking a couple of weeks' vacation. \nLOOMIS You never took a fucking vacation in your life, Harry. What's going on? \nHARRY I got to go.  I'm late. \nLOOMIS Call me tomorrow. \nHARRY There's other guys as good as me, Loomis. \nLOOMIS Yeah.  But not as cheap.

LUKE'S SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY \nHarry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which steadily gets louder as they walk. \nJENNIFER Have we met before? \nHARRY No. \nJENNIFER Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things, \nHARRY Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield. \nJENNIFER Maybe... I... don't... \nHARRY What about Philip Swann? \nJENNIFER I knew Swann. (sudden vehemence) He's a fucking liar. \nA WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes. \nHARRY Why's that? \nJENNIFER He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with. \nHARRY What is? \nJENNIFER (tears nearing) I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me. \nHARRY Swann? \nAhead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole, laying pipes.  The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but we're aware of it. \nJENNIFER I told you.  I don't -- \nShe stops.  Looks ahead of her.  Her face is suddenly ashen and clammy.  Harry follows her gaze to: \nThe hole.  Somebody is in it, digging.  Earth emerges in shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole. \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) (screaming) God no!  Oh God no! \nShe backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her. \nNURSE Calm down! \nShe delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.  The Nurse is flung back. \nJENNIFER He's not going to get me! \nShe races down towards the street.  Harry goes after her. \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) He's not!  He's not! \nHARRY Who's not? \nHe catches up with her. \nJENNIFER Nix! Nix! \nHARRY Is he the Puritan? \nJENNIFER Yes! Yes! \nHARRY And he's dead? \nJENNIFER No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out! \nThe Nurse appears behind Harry. \nNURSE I'll take care of her now. \nJennifer struggles in Harry's grip. \nNURSE Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour! \nThe Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away instantly, racing towards the street. \nHARRY Jennifer! \nShe scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the top.  There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of metalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the Nurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down. \nHARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET \nJennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the wheels of a car.  The DRIVER is out, and yelling incoherently. \nHARRY Jesus. \nHe slips back down the wall, and leans against it. \nHe looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging. His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from a grave.  Harry closes his eyes. \n", "test2_true": "EXT.

I'll get the number changed. \nDOROTHEA No word from D'Amour? \nValentin shakes his head. \nVALENTIN It's better he's gone.  He would have done more harm than good. \nDOROTHEA Harm to whom?  Me?  I don't think, so.  Try him again at the hotel. \nVALENTIN I left three messages already. \nDorothea nods, plainly sad at Harry's desertion.  She turns and leaves the room. \nINT.

The door opens. \nBILLY Houdini'd been proud of you. \nINT. MAGIC CASTLE - REPOSITORY - NIGHT \nUndusted shelves piled high with manuscripts, old books, and posters in every direction. \nBILLY (impressed) Whoa... \nOn the wall, plaster LIFE-MASKS.  In glass cases, the tools of the great magicians:  KNIVES, KEYS, GUNS, WANDS, even an IRON MAIDEN.  Billy is in awe.  He wanders around wide-eyed while Harry scans the shelves. The dialogue runs as they investigate. \nBILLY I hear Mrs. Swann's quite a babe. \nHARRY You heard right. \nBILLY You ever been married? \nHARRY Yeah.  She was killed in a car crash.

They start to sob. \nThen, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow. \nNIX I've come back to share the wisdom of the grave.  Will you hear it? \nCULTISTS Yes... yes... \nNIX Follow me then. \nHe steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of adoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea. \nNIX Do I know you, child? \nHe reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea keeps her self-possession; but only just. \nNIX Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun this time, child? (a beat) Where's Swann? \nDOROTHEA I don't know where he is. \nNix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground. \nNIX He'll come.

NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT \nNix strides into the middle of the room. \nNIX (whispered to Dorothea) Something terrible's going to happen.  But if you hold on to me, very tight, you may live a little longer. \nThe Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY. \nNIX (to Cultists) Are you ready for my wisdom? \nCULTISTS Tell us... tell us... \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT \nHarry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows. He is frozen by the memory of what happened here. \nON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that terrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh. \nSWANN (in terrified awe) This is where we killed him. \nHARRY (looking at table) You didn't try hard enough. \nSWANN I can't... I can't go any further... \nHarry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked grip.  He crosses to the door. \nSuddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. \nHe has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT \nNIX Here is my wisdom. \nHe stamps on the ground.

As Nix REVOLVES, the darkness STRIKES the GROUND around the Cultists. \nAt first they don't realize what's going on.  They think this is some kind of bizarre blessing. \nThen the ground starts to LIQUIFY beneath them. \nNORMAN What's happening? \nNIX I have to give something back. So I'm giving you. \nThey're starting to SCREAM now as they sink into the ground. They struggle, of course, but the earth seems to be hungry for them.  They are dragged down, THRASHING as they SINK. \nBARBARA (sobbing) Why?  Why? \nNIX You're not worthy.  None of you. Only Swann was worthy. You just waited like lambs. \nHarry appears in the doorway.  Nix, still swinging round, has his back to Harry. \nNIX Well I'm not your shepherd. \nHarry surveys the horrific scene in front of him.  The ground is now re-solidifying around the Cultists, some of whom have disappeared from view completely, some of whom still reach up out of the dirt.  The scene has a surreal beauty to it despite its horror.  SCREAMING FACES locked in the solid ground.  TWITCHING HANDS the same. Harry starts towards Nix and Dorothea, GUN levelled.  So far, he has avoided Nix's gaze. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT \nButterfield and Swann are locked in a life-or-death struggle. They tumble back against the table upon which Nix was resurrected.  It collapses under them, and for a moment Swann is stunned.  Butterfield snatches up one of the instruments and STABS at Swann, who rolls out of the way in the nick of time. \nThe BLADE catches him in the arm, however. \nSWANN Aah! \nBUTTERFIELD Go on, bleed. (he slashes at Swann again) Go on!  Go on! \nButterfield comes after him, and Swann backs off against a wall.  He SPITS out a serpentine FLAME, which races across the floor and leaps at Butterfield's face! \nBUTTERFIELD (screaming) No! \nHe falls backwards, his face ON FIRE.  Swann doesn't wait to watch him die, but races out into the passageway, BLOOD running from his wound. \nINT.

He's a yard from the edge of the pit now. \nNix swings round. \nNIX You're not Swann.  Who are you? (a beat) ) Oh... I know what you want. He lets Dorothea slip from his arms. \nHarry flings himself towards the hole and CATCHES HOLD of Dorothea's arm before she falls away into the abyss.  His GUN goes spinning across the ground, back towards the door leading to the passageway. \nDOROTHEA Oh God! \nHARRY Hang on! \nNix reaches down to torment Harry.  But before he can make contact \nSWANN (V.O.) Nix! \nNix looks up. \nNIX There you are. \nSuddenly, Nix isn't interested in Harry and Dorothea. He steps onto solid ground, and walks towards Swann, his tone suddenly conversational. \nNIX I've had a lot of time to think about you.  Where I went wrong... \nWith Nix's back turned, Harry pulls Dorothea back out of the chasm. \nSWANN And? \nNIX I should have been honest with you, right from the start.

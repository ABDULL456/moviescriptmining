{"train": "\"Lord of Illusions\" -- by Clive Barker \nTITLE SEQUENCE \nAs the credits run, we INTERCUT the following two sequences: \nEXT. NEVADA DESERT - IDOLS - DAY \nA SLOW DRIFT through a collection of crudely constructed, surreal, six-foot tall \"IDOLS.\"  Like modern demons. Grotesque.  Disturbing. WE LAP DISSOLVE between details of their twisted anatomies:  headlamp eyes, bright metal claws, broken glass teeth. \nEXT. NEVADA ROADS - DESERT - DAY \nTwo vehicles, one a Volkswagen \"bus\" decorated with stylized flames, the other a '66 Thunderbird, speeding along a series of eerily empty desert roads, somewhere in a wilderness of sand and heat. \nEND CREDITS. \nCUT WIDE TO; \nEXT. NEVADA DESERT - DAY \nA violent WIND HOWLS around, but through the sand we-can just make out a large, ominous building:  the HOUSE of William Nix.  Its walls are white-washed and scrawled with GRAFFITI. The \"family\" of IDOLS surrounds the doorway, guarding it. ON SCREEN, the words:  '\"Nevada - Thirteen Years Ago\" \nEXT. NIX'S HOUSE - DAY \nWe're at the front door now, which stands open.  Leaning against the door-frame is a scrawny, wild-eyed YOUTH, about sixteen.  His name is BUTTERFIELD.  He's got a brooding, almost sultry look on his face.  One of his eyes is black, the other milky blue.  He's whittling something with a scalpel. Distantly, the sound of CAR ENGINES.  Butterfield narrows his eyes. \nBUTTERFIELD'S P.O.V. \nThe Volkswagen \"bus\" and Thunderbird are approaching the house. \nBUTTERFIELD (softly) Swann...? \nHe turns from the door.  In his haste he drops the WOOD he's whittling.  He's been carving a DEATH'S HEAD. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - ROOMS AND CORRIDORS - DAY \nThe house no longer serves any domestic function.  It has become the temple and dormitory of Nix's small apocalyptic cult.  As we go through the house with Butterfield we glimpse a little of what life here is like. \nThe rooms are murky, and chaotic.  The walls, PAINTED with scenes of cities and landscapes BURNING, and creatures from some unspeakable nightmare ATTACKING, RAPING, and DEVOURING helpless humanity.  The atmosphere is joyless, and oppressive. \nThe passages become progressively darker as the boy makes his way to the heart of the house.  Only OIL LAMPS, set on the floor, light these claustrophobic corridors. \nBUTTERFIELD Master? \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - DAY \nA dozen CULTISTS sit cross-legged on the floor in front of their leader, WILLIAM NIX.  His black hair grows to his shoulders.  His eyes are deep and glittering, his voice seductive.  A terrifying yet charismatic presence. \nAll the Cultists - who are a cross-section of obsessives - wear the same simple T-shirts, painted with the cult's SIGIL. They watch Nix in adoration. \nAs Nix speaks, he juggles a FLAME, passing it from hand to hand with casual ease... \nNIX And the fire said to me:  Nix, Nix, you're my instrument. From now on, you'll be called the Puritan... \nCULTISTS (murmuring) Puritan... \nNIX You will find a few good men and women, and together, together you will cleanse the world. \nCULTISTS Yes... \nButterfield enters. \nBUTTERFIELD Master? \nNix looks up. \nBUTTERFIELD Swann's here. \nNix rises, smiling. \nNIX (to Cultists) We'll come back to this. Get about your business. \nAs the Cultists disperse, Nix and Butterfield exit into \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY \nA place of nightmares. Hanging from the middle of the ceiling is another grotesque SCULPTURE, three times the bulk of a large man, and made of metal, fly-blown animal parts and knotted rope.  It is vaguely cruciform, but its swaying, creaking bulk is not even faintly Christian.  It is a perverse, sickening image, evoking insanity and agony. \nFrom the shadows in the corner, we hear a young girl's soft SOBBING. \nNIX Hush... \nNix goes to the GIRL.  She is twelve; beautiful, blonde, and presently in a state of mortal fear.  She sits, bound, in a fetal position, her face soaked with SWEAT and TEARS, her mouth BLOODIED, her cheek BRUISED. \nNIX I said hush. \nGIRL Please.  Let me go. \nFrom the opposite corner the SCREECH of Nix's pet BABOON. Nix goes to it.  The animal is large and lethal. \nNIX (to Baboon) What is it? \nINT.   NIX'S  HOUSE  -   \"BEDROOM\"   -  DAY \nJennifer enters a gloomy room.  She goes to a mattress where a BLONDE GIRL lies with her bare back to us. \nJENNIFER Don't be afraid. \nThe Blonde Girl, BARBARA, turns over.  She has a dirty cloth pressed to a wound between her breasts.  It is not the Girl, of course.  She stares up at Jennifer, clearly drugged. \nBARBARA I'm not... want to see? \nShe pulls the cloth away.  She has carved the cult SIGIL into her FLESH.  The BLOODY KNIFE lies beside her. Jennifer retreats to the door, and exits back out into -- \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY \nPimm is standing against the wall, clutching a CRUCIFIX. He is ashen with terror.  Jennifer snatches the crucifix from his white-knuckled fingers. \nPIMM He's going to kill us all... \nJENNIFER Where did Swann go? \nPimm points down the passageway towards Nix's room. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY OUTSIDE NIX'S SANCTUM - DAY \nSwann wipes sweat from his upper lip, then reaches down to his belt, to check the GUN tucked out of sight at his side. He turns the door handle. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY \nSwann steps inside.  Nix's chair has its back to him. The folds of Nix's robe are visible, however.  Swann hears a muffled SOBBING from the far side of the room. \nOn the Girl, now gagged and lying amongst bones and filth. \nSwann starts towards her, his footsteps barely audible.  As he approaches the chair - the Baboon leaps at him screeching! \nHe reaches for his gun.  The chair topples.  The Baboon, half dressed in Nix's robes, bounds towards Swann. \nSwann FIRES at it.  The bullet blasts off half its head. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY \nOn Quaid, who draws his GUN as three CULTISTS appear in the passageway that leads to Nix's Sanctum. \nQUAID Stay the fuck away! (yells) Pimm!  Get over here! \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY \nPAN UP from the twitching Baboon corpse to Swann as he struggles with the Girl's gag.  He has laid his gun on the ground beside her. \nSWANN You're going to be okay. \nOut of focus, behind him, the cruciform sculpture swings round.  Nix is hanging on it, like an idol on a grotesque altarpiece. \nThe Girl sees Nix over Swann's shoulder.  Terror crosses her face.  Swann turns. \nNIX I knew you'd come. \nHe reaches down to Swann. \nNIX I've got so much power to give you, Swann.  All you have to do is...beg. \nSWANN Fuck you. \nNIX You don't think I've got it to give? \nSWANN No! \nSuddenly. Nix swoops down on Swann. apparently defying gravity. \nNIX You're wrong. \nHe catches hold of Swann with one hand and drives him back against the wall. \nNIX I could eat your fucking soul, Swann. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY \nJennifer, reaches the door of the Sanctum.  Butterfield steps from the shadows.  His KNIFE flashes as it strikes Jennifer's hand.  BLOOD SPURTS. \nJENNIFER Fuck! \nShe retreats, staunching her bleeding hand. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY \nNix has Swann trapped against the wall and is working his fingers against Swann's temples.  Working, working, like a psychic surgeon plying against the belly of a patient. \nNIX You want to know what the world really looks like? \nSwann struggles, but he can't get free of Nix's hold. \nAnd now -- horribly -- Nix's fingers slide beneath the skin of Swann's temples, without a drop of blood being spilt. \nSWANN Binding you. \nHe clamps one of the pieces over Nix's EYES.  It fits like an eyeless mask.  Nix thrashes and SCREAMS.  Swann lays his hands on the side of the mask, and \u0097 LIKE MAGIC -- his touch makes the screws tighten of their own accord, grinding into Nix's flesh and bone with a gut- wrenching SOUND.  BLOOD runs from the screw-holes. \nNIX Fuck you, Swann!  Fuck you! \nNow the second piece, over his MOUTH. \nNIX Sw\u0097 \nHe's silenced.  The piece screws itself into-his head, like the first.  And now comes the third and final piece:  over the nose and into the ears.  Again, it screws itself into place. \nSwann has done all he can.  He retreats from Nix's body, as it continues to convulse.  We go from face to ashen face, as each man and woman watches and waits.  Why won't he die? \nAnd now, at last  the violence of Nix's death-throes diminishes.  Nix's body bends like a bow, arching off the ground, and with one last, terrible spasm, he dies. \nGIRL (quietly) Is it finished? \nSWANN It's finished. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - DAY \nThe Cultists' faces slacken, as though some mental hold Nix had upon them has disappeared.  Then they start to retreat, their confidence and courage gone. \nPimm steps into the Sanctum. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - DAY \nThe five assassins, including the Girl, stand around Nix's body.  Swann has his arm around the Girl. \nPIMM Dead? \nQUAID Dead. \nPIMM What now? \nSWANN We bury him so deep no one will ever find him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NIX'S .HOUSE - WIDE SHOT - DUSK \nThe wind has died away.  It's eerily calm.  Butterfield dashes towards camera, then halts. \nHE LOOKS BACK, as Nix's killers load his huge, limp CORPSE into the back of Murray Pimm's bus. \nON Butterfield.  He watches, with a feral look on his face. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN \nEXT. LOS ANGELES - MONTAGE - DAY \nThe city looks magical in the spring light, its palms and gleaming towers, its rivers of sun-baked traffic, evoking some fantastical metropolis.  This, for all its smog and congestion, is a city of exoticism and enchantments. \nON SCREEN, the words:  \"LOS ANGELES - THIRTEEN YEARS LATER\" \nEXT. STARDUST HOTEL - DAY \nThe facade of this small HOTEL off Hollywood Boulevard needs a lick of paint, and the neon sign is blinking fitfully, but it has a certain charm. \nINT. STARDUST HOTEL - LOBBY - DAY \nA large deteriorating mural of Hollywoodland, depicting a host of 50's movie stars, dominates the lobby. At the front desk - with his back to us at present - stands HARRY D'AMOUR.  He is having difficulty getting the pretty but vacant BLONDE at the reception desk to comprehend his name. \nBLONDE GIRL How'd you spell that again? \nHARRY D.A.M.O.U.R.  D'Amour.  Harry D'Amour. \nBLONDE GIRL D'Amour. \nHARRY Right. \nBLONDE GIRL Isn't that French for something? \nON THE BELLBOY, approaching Harry from the front door. \nBELLBOY Mister D'Amour? \nHARRY (to Blonde) Yeah.  It's French. \nBLONDE GIRL For love, right? \nBELLBOY Mister D'Amour? \nHARRY (to Blonde) Right. \nBLONDE GIRL (grinning) That's so cool. \nBELLBOY Mister D'Amour? \nFrom out of the Fortune Telling Room, a MOAN. \nQUAID (V.O.) Ahh. . . \nHarry crosses the Waiting Room, reaching into his jacket for his gun.  Suddenly, a nightmarish FIGURE leaps from the shadows. \nHis name is RAY MILLER.  He's as crazy as a rabid dog, teeth sharpened, eyes wild.  Nix's SIGIL is tattooed on the middle of his forehead.  He STRIKES the GUN from Harry's hand and goes for his throat. \nHarry reaches out behind him, picks up a phrenologist's BUST and SMASHES it on Miller's skull. \nMiller reels back.  Harry makes a dash for the door to the Fortune Telling Room. \nMILLER Fuckhead. \nINT. QUAID'S OFFICES - FORTUNE-TELLING ROOM - NIGHT \nA mysterious, candle-lit space.  In the middle of the room, a table.  At it sits Quaid. thirteen years older. He has been tortured close to death.  Several small SCALPELS protrude from his chest and neck.  His life is ebbing away.  On the table in front of him, a fan of TAROT CARDS, BLOOD-SPATTERED. \nHarry races in through the open door from the Waiting Room. \nHARRY What the fuck!? \nHarry picks up the PHONE.  It's dead.  Miller charges at the door. \nHARRY Shit! \nHarry SLAMS the door in Miller's face, and locks it. \nAs he does so, the candles FLICKER.  Harry looks up.  A FIGURE looms from the darkness behind Quaid.  He's in his late twenties:  an androgynous, disturbing sight. His long hair is drawn back into a pony-tail.  His mismatched eyes - one black, one milky blue, tell us that he is Butterfield. His hands are BLOODY, and he carries one last SCALPEL. \nHARRY (to Butterfield) Don't touch him.\" \nButterfield strokes the wounds on Quaid's cheek.  Quaid sobs in pain. \nBUTTERFIELD What are you going to do about it? \nMiller's hand tears at the wood around the lock from the other side.  His fingers appear, scrabbling to tear the lock out.  Harry doesn't move, or Miller will be through. \nBUTTERFIELD (to Harry) Ever watched a man die?  If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. And if you're very quick, you can catch it. \nQUAID Please... Butterfield... I wasn't there.  Ask Pimm. \nBUTTERFIELD Pimm's dead.  Jennifer Desiderio's disappeared.  They knew the Puritan was coming home. \nAs this exchange goes on, Miller pulls the lock out of the door and starts to THROW HIMSELF against it from the other side.  It's all Harry can do to keep himself from being pitched across the room.  He looks around for some means of defense.  There's a crack in the drapes to the left of the table.  Behind it a WINDOW. \nBUTTERFIELD So do you.  You've seen the future. Haven't you? \nQUAID Yes. \nBUTTERFIELD And are you afraid? \nQUAID Yes. \nSuddenly, Harry steps aside.  The door's flung open. Miller CHARGES in.  Harry catches hold of his arm, and THROWS him against the drape.  The window CRACKS; the drape comes down around Miller.  Amber STREETLIGHT floods in. \nButterfield is momentarily distracted.  Harry STRIKES the scalpel from his hands. \nMiller, meanwhile, is struggling to free himself from the folds of the drapes.  Harry lands a solid KICK to the man's belly.  Miller is THROWN back against the cracked window, which SHATTERS.  Still wrapped in the drape, he FALLS OUT. \nHarry turns back to arrest Butterfield, but he's already making his escape.  Harry starts after him. \nQUAID (to Harry) Don't leave me. \nHe turns back.  TEARS are pouring down the man's face. Harry goes back to comfort Quaid, as Butterfield escapes down the stairs. \nHARRY You need an ambulance. \nQUAID (in pain) Too late.  Why are you here? Did you cone... up here for a reading? \nQuaid takes hold of Harry's hand. \nHARRY NO ... I... \nQuaid stares at Harry's HAND.  Fascinated, he momentarily forgets his pain.  He traces the lines with bloody fingers. \nQUAID (quietly) My God. \nHARRY What? \nQUAID You've taken some strange journeys in your life. \nHARRY Yeah.  You could say that. \nQUAID You're drawn to the dark side, over and over.  And it's drawn to you. (looks at Harry) You don't like that. \nHARRY Not much. \nQUAID You can't change it.  You have to walk... (coughs) ...walk the line between Heaven and Hell.  It's your destiny.  Accept it. \nHarry takes his hand from Quaid's grip.  Quaid winces in pain. \nEXT. PHILADELPHIA STREET - MORNING \nOn screen:  Philadelphia \nA suburban street.  Early morning light. \nINT. SUBURBAN HOUSE - PHILADELPHIA - MORNING \nCLOSE-UP of a PHOTOGRAPH of the Cultist with the Painted Face, from the opening scene, standing outside Nix's house in Nevada.  His name is Norman Sanders. \nON NORMAN, thirteen years older, looking down at the photograph.  He lays it down, beside a letter, on which two words are written: \"Homecoming Time.\" \nNorman smiles to himself.  Goes to the wardrobe.  Gets out a small suitcase.  His WIFE'S BODY is slumped in the wardrobe, glassy-eyed. \nCLOSE UP of letter -\u0097 \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN IN MIAMI HOUSE - DAY \n\u0097- and DRAW OUT from the letter to a different interior, a different domestic circumstance. \nOn the screen:  Miami. \nBARBARA - the blonde girl who carved the cult's sigil into her chest - is washing her hands.  She casually dries them, and picks up the letter, walking past her HUSBAND and SON, both DEAD at the breakfast table, BLOOD spreading around their heads.  When she gets to the door she steps over the body of her DAUGHTER, who has also been shot trying to escape her mother's murder spree. \nON THE RADIO, George Harrison sings \"My Sweet Lord.\" \nRADIO \"I really want to see you, Lord, And it won't take long, my Lord, My sweet Lord...\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SAN ANTONIO 200 - REPTILE HOUSE - DAY \nOn screen:  San Antonio. \nA ZOO-KEEPER wanders into the darkened interior of the Reptile House. \nINT. REPTILE HOUSE - DAY \nThe Zoo-keeper's benign expression changes at the sight of the chaos inside.  The glass cases have been SMASHED. Another KEEPER lies on the ground, his face pulped.  A few SNAKES slither around his body, but most of them have gone. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST'S CAR - DAY \nThe Snake-Handler Cultist drives at speed. \nINT. SNAKE-HANDLER CULTIST'S CAR - DAY \nPAN UP from another letter'- with the same message - on the dashboard, to the crazed face of the Snake-Handler. PAN TO the back of the car.  IT SEETHES WITH HUNDREDS OF SNAKES. \nEXT. SWANN'S MANSION - DAY \nIt's early morning in Bel-Air.  The sun shines down on a millionaire's paradise:  a huge house surrounded by a jungle of trees and blossoms. \nEXT. SWANN'S MANSION - POOLSIDE - DAY \nThe blue water glitters in the noon-day sun.  And a WOMAN -- her body perfectly proportioned -- glides under the surface, emerging at the shallow end, where the housekeeper CLEMENZIA is setting a tray on a table. \nCLEMENZIA Coffee, Mrs. Swann? \nMrs. Swann's name is DOROTHEA.  She is a beautiful and sensual woman. \nDOROTHEA Thank you. \nShe dries off. \nDOROTHEA Where's Mr. Swann? \nCLEMENZIA In his study. (a beat) He got something on his mind? \nDOROTHEA Why? \nCLEMENZIA Bad mood today. \nINT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - DAY \nVenetian blinds shut out most of the sunlight, but a lamp burns on the desk (huge), showing us the furniture (leather), the books (innumerable), and the figure of SWANN, sitting behind the desk smoking a CIGAR.  He's lost some hair and some colour over the years, but he still has the same hypnotic eyes. \nHe studies the L.A. TIMES in front of him. \nON THE OPEN PAGE \n\"Fortune Teller Brutally Murdered,\" the headline announces. Underneath, a PHOTOGRAPH of Quaid's wrecked room.  WE CLOSE IN on the photograph, and catch a glimpse of Harry, standing looking at the chaos.  CAMERA. MOVES DOWN to the text beneath, and on to the name \"Harry D'Amour.\" \nON SWANN, pensive as he studies the paper. \nDOROTHEA (V.O.) (softly) Hey... \nHe looks up, startled. \nHARRY What? \nLOOMIS Who is she? \nHarry can't help but smile to himself. \nLOOMIS I thought so.  'Night, Harry. \nClick.  Harry puts down the phone.  Glances at himself in the mirror.  Raises a rueful eyebrow. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. WILTERN THEATRE - NIGHT \nCRANE DOWN from a looming STANDEE of Swann, perched above the theatre marquee.  SPOTLIGHTS rake the skies. The sidewalk below is jammed with AUDIENCE MEMBERS, STAR-SPOTTERS and PHOTOGRAPHERS.  This is a flashy, prestigious event.  LIMOS are disgorging scantily- dressed STARLETS and smiling MONEY MEN; a NEWS TEAM is interviewing audience members as they file in. \nThe atmosphere is noisy and excited.  Amid the throng, Harry. He makes his way inside. \nINT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM - NIGHT \nThe atmosphere, is closer to a rock concert than a conventional stage show.  Security people with walkie- talkies roam the aisles; the audience buzzes with barely controlled hysteria. \nHarry heads down the aisle, eyes on the stage.  A star-lit CURTAIN covers it.  Six rows from the stage is Dorothea, already in her seat.  She smiles lavishly, happy to see him. \nDOROTHEA I'm glad you could make it. \nHarry takes a seat beside her. \nHARRY Hey, this is a big deal for me. You know what seats like this cost in New York? \nINT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT \nCenter-stage, behind the closed curtains, Swann is ready for the opening of the show.  TECHNICIANS buzz around him like flies. \nSWANN Valentin! \nValentin emerges from the wings, patting the PANTHER that is waiting there. \nSWANN (irritated) Valentin! \nVALENTIN I'm here. \nSWANN The guy with Dorothea.  Is that who I think it is? \nValentin nods. \nON SWANN, his expression unreadable. \nSWANN He's young. \nMUSIC strikes up.  A dramatic, Wagnerian chord. Valentin hurries away.  Swann's expression becomes very focused. \n1ST TECHNICIAN (to Swann) Ready? \nSWANN Ready. \nSwann rises up into the flies. \n1ST TECHNICIAN How the fuck does he do that? \n2ND TECHNICIAN It's wires, man. \n1ST TECHNICIAN I never seen no wires. \n2ND TECHNICIAN (sarcastic) So what is it?  Magic? \nINT. WILTERN THEATRE - AUDITORIUM AND STAGE - NIGHT \nThe LIGHTS are DIMMING.  Harry glances across at Dorothea, whose gaze is intent. \nThe LIGHTS go OUT.  The MUSIC SWELLS, and the CURTAINS fly apart.  A spectacle worthy of Seigfried and Roy is about to blast our senses!  Magic for the 90's:  a wild, erotic ride into mystery. \nSWANN (V.O.) Ladies and gentlemen.  You are standing on the threshold of a miracle... \nA vortex of SMOKE and LIGHT swirls in the middle of the stage. \nThe vortex BLAZES -- \nAnd suddenly Swann SWEEPS DOWN out of the flies, as the floor of the stage opens and the head of a glittering, razor toothed DRAGON emerges in a cloud of CRIMSON SMOKE. \nSwann raises his hands above his head and a SPEAR miraculously appears in his grasp.  He descends on the dragon.  It's a classic image:  St. Michael smiting the Devil.  Swann drives the spear down the throat of the dragon. The theatre SHAKES at its dying ROARS.  Then the head cracks open, and out of the dragon's mouth emerge a dozen scantily dressed DANCERS, male and female.  Swann throws down the spear, and where it strikes the stage his PANTHER appears. \nA ROAR of APPLAUSE from the audience.  Swann's plain white tunic falls away from him as he descends.  By the time his feet touch the stage he is dressed in a star- shot TUXEDO. The PANTHER licks his hand in welcome. The MUSIC comes to a crescendo.  The DANCERS freeze in their erotic dance.  In the sudden hush, Swann speaks in a whisper. \nSWANN My friends ... come with me...into the Great Beyond. \nA barrage of LIGHTS and MUSIC erupt. \nThe AUDIENCE APPLAUDS wildly. \nON HARRY and Dorothea. \nThe audience is clearing now.  But Butterfield is coming towards the stage, with an ambiguous look on his face. Is he enraged?  Or puzzled?  Or both? \nMILLER Psst! \nMiller stands at an open door, leading below the stage. \nButterfield enters. \nINT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - NIGHT \nDorothea kneels at Swann's side.  A few yards from her, Harry examines the mechanism of the wheel. \nDOROTHEA (softly) Swann... \nA DOCTOR appears. \nDOCTOR I'm a doctor.  Let me through. \nThe Doctor checks Swann's body. \nDOCTOR (to Dorothea) I'm sorry... \nHarry has discovered a CABLE snaking down beside the device. He's suspicious.  He slips round to the back of the mechanism, and climbs down beneath the stage, tracing the cable as he goes. \nWILTERN THEATRE - BELOW STAGE - NIGHT \nIt's an eerie, shadowy space, filled with the PROPS that are used in the show, including the DRAGON we saw at the beginning.  From above we hear FOOTSTEPS and VOICES, muted and echoing. \nThe cable ends in bare wires.  Whatever was here has been taken. \nA NOISE, behind Harry.  He swings round.  Sees a shadowy FIGURE ducking away. \nHARRY Hey! \nHe gives chase.  Loses the man in the shadows.  Stops and listens for movement. \nSuddenly, Miller steps out of the shadows with a plank of wood and smashes it into Harry's face! \nHarry reels back.  Falls to his knees, BLOOD running from his nose.  Miller pulls Harry's GUN out of his jacket. \nMILLER Got you, fucker! \nHarry is facing the dragon's head, dazed.  And now, out of the dragon's mouth, comes Butterfield. \nBUTTERFIELD Who did this, D'Amour?  Who killed Swann? \nHarry is barely holding on to consciousness. \nHARRY You did. (a beat) Didn't you? \nBUTTERFIELD Why would I do that? \nHARRY Beats me. \nButterfield is a foot from Harry now. \nBUTTERFIELD You don't have a clue what you're into, do you? \nHARRY Deep shit? \nButterfield hits him. \nBUTTERFIELD Who did this? \nHARRY I told you -- \nButterfield hits him again. \nBUTTERFIELD Who did this? \nHARRY (raises his hand) All right.  It was... \nButterfield comes a little closer. \nHARRY (feigning a near collapse) ... it was... \nButterfield leans in.  And Harry grabs him by the balls -- literally -- rising as he does so. \nBUTTERFIELD Aah! \nHarry THROWS Butterfield aside. Butterfield hits the ground in agony, and Harry swings round to protect himself from Miller, who's leveling Harry's gun. \nHe FIRES once, missing Harry by inches.  Harry catches hold of a ROPE underfoot and pulls it, tripping Miller, who TOPPLES backwards into the mouth of the dragon.  The GUN GOES OFF again, the bullet BLOWING APART the dragon's JAW MECHANISM. \nMiller starts to sit up, his body splayed between the dragon's steel teeth.  He has Harry in his sights. \n-- something CREAKS.  He looks up.  The dragon's jaw is closing, FAST.  He starts to scramble to his feet.  Too late! The teeth SLAM CLOSED on his body.  Sudden death. \nHarry looks round to see Butterfield retreating into the shadows.  Then he's gone.  Harry looks down at Miller's BLOOD, which is pooling around his feet. \nHARRY Deep shit... \nHARRY (not a clue) Sure.  Vivovich. \nWILDER He knew Swann way back.  He says there were a lot of drugs, a lot of crazy shit. \nHARRY I'd love to... you know... hang with some of you guys. \nWILDER People are pretty cagey.  Who do you know? \nHARRY For what? \nWILDER For an introduction. \nHARRY Well... nobody. \nWilder takes a moment to assess Harry, who is attempting to manipulate the card he's been given with charming ineptitude. \nWILDER (magnanimously) You do now. \nEXT. MAGIC CASTLE - DUSK \nThe castle is faux, of course, but it has a Gothic charm. \nHarry and Walter wander towards the front door.  Harry is knotting a newly-bought tie. \nHARRY I only wear ties for funerals. \nWILDER You don't get in without one. It's like a gentlemen's club for illusionists.  Except most of us aren't gentlemen. \nINT. MAGIC CASTLE - CORRIDORS - NIGHT \nThe interior is murky and atmospheric, the walls covered with illusionists' posters. \nWalter leads the way through the long corridors, past rooms where illusionists are performing close-up magic for audiences of well-heeled patrons.  Walter nods and waves to half a dozen people on their way through the house, up the stairs and towards the bar. \nHARRY Are they all in the business? \nWILDER It's not a business. Harry. It's a vocation. \nWilder points to a locked door. \nWILDER That's what they call the Repository.  Every magic secret known to man's locked up in that room. \nHARRY Have you been in? \nWILDER No.  There's only three keys. Vinovich has got one, of course. (beat) He's a little crazy, by the way. And he's a mean drunk. Otherwise, he's a real charmer. \nCUT TO \nINT. MAGIC CASTLE - BAR - NIGHT \nLater.  A drunken VINOVICH is holding court.  He's in his 40's:  a flamboyant and loquacious man with a heavy (and fake) middle-European accent.  At the table - besides Harry and Walter - are:  Vinovich's starlet/nymphet girlfriend LAURA; an Asian-American illusionist called BILLY WHO; and two of Vinovich's adoring courtiers, an overblown, overdressed female illusionist - DEBRA DEVINE - and a thin, waspish fellow in a spangly suit:  the AMAZING QUENTIN. \nIn the conversation that follows we go back to Harry repeatedly as he studies this extraordinary group. \nVINOVICH It's more than entertainment. We're opening people's heads up.  Putting miracles back into their boring little lives. \nBILLY But they're fake miracles. \nVINOVICH Houdini believed he had spirit guides. \nHARRY You believe that? \nVINOVICH I think we walk a narrow path, between... between... \nHARRY Heaven and Hell? \nVinovich stares hard at Harry, trying to figure out whether he's being sarcastic or not. \nVINOVICH Trickery and divinity. \nHARRY Are you saying that sometimes the miracles are real? \nVINOVICH No.  I'm saying they were always fake.  The saints, the messiahs, they were just illusionists. \nHARRY So could you walk on water? \nVINOVICH (deadly serious) I could reproduce any miracle that's ever been performed, with a little preparation. \nHARRY What about Swann's miracles? \nThe smug smile on Vinovich's face dies.  Furtive glances are exchanged around the table.  Only Billy Who makes a tiny smile. \nVINOVICH They weren't worth a damn. \nHARRY (goading) I heard he was the best. \nVINOVICH If he was so good why's he so dead? \nVinovich begins to look suspicious. \nHARRY You tell me.  No?  I thought you'd maybe have a theory. \nJennifer turns.  She looks terrible. \nEXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - GROUNDS - CITY STREET - DAY \nHarry and Jennifer walk amongst the flower-beds, with the Nurse keeping a watch from a discreet distance. Throughout the scene we HEAR the SOUND of earth being dug, which steadily gets louder as they walk. \nJENNIFER Have we met before? \nHARRY No. \nJENNIFER Only I forget.  They give me pills, you know, to keep me... even... and... I forget things, \nHARRY Well, you didn't forget me.  I just came because I wanted to know if you knew a man called Butterfield. \nJENNIFER Maybe... I... don't... \nHARRY What about Philip Swann? \nJENNIFER I knew Swann. (sudden vehemence) He's a fucking liar. \nA WORKMAN saunters past, carrying pipes. \nHARRY Why's that? \nJENNIFER He said he knew how to protect us. But he didn't know anything.  He made us think it was over and done with. \nHARRY What is? \nJENNIFER (tears nearing) I don't want to think about it. If I think about it he'll hear me. He'll find me. \nHARRY Swann? \nAhead now, the site where the workmen are digging a hole, laying pipes.  The CAMERA doesn't focus on this action, but we're aware of it. \nJENNIFER I told you.  I don't -- \nShe stops.  Looks ahead of her.  Her face is suddenly ashen and clammy.  Harry follows her gaze to: \nThe hole.  Somebody is in it, digging.  Earth emerges in shovelfuls, piling up beside the hole. \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) (screaming) God no!  Oh God no! \nShe backs away from the hole.  The Nurse grabs hold of her. \nNURSE Calm down! \nShe delivers the Nurse a backhand SWIPE.  The Nurse is flung back. \nJENNIFER He's not going to get me! \nShe races down towards the street.  Harry goes after her. \nJENNIFER (CONT'D) He's not!  He's not! \nHARRY Who's not? \nHe catches up with her. \nJENNIFER Nix! Nix! \nHARRY Is he the Puritan? \nJENNIFER Yes! Yes! \nHARRY And he's dead? \nJENNIFER No.  He's coming back.  He's digging his way out! \nThe Nurse appears behind Harry. \nNURSE I'll take care of her now. \nJennifer struggles in Harry's grip. \nNURSE Let go of her, Mr. D'Amour! \nThe Nurse breaks Harry's hold on Jennifer, who slips away instantly, racing towards the street. \nHARRY Jennifer! \nShe scrambles up over a wall, and flings herself from the top.  There's a SCREECH of brakes, then the smashing of metalwork and glass.  Harry gets to the wall before the Nurse.  Hoists himself up onto it.  Looks down. \nHARRY'S P.O.V. OF STREET \nJennifer is dead in the middle of the street, beneath the wheels of a car.  The DRIVER is out, and yelling incoherently. \nHARRY Jesus. \nHe slips back down the wall, and leans against it. \nHe looks towards the hole.  The Workman has stopped digging. His mud-encrusted hands emerge, and for a moment, before his head appears, the image is eerily like somebody climbing from a grave.  Harry closes his eyes. \nHarry has seen a small SIGIL carved onto one of the shelves. \nHARRY Billy?  This was on Miller's forehead.  Any idea what it is? \nBILLY Nope. \nHarry presses it.  The entire bookcase opens up, CREAKING. \nBILLY What did I tell you?  So fucking hokey. \nInside, there is a small shelf.  On it, FILES and PAPERS. \nHARRY What have we got here? \nEver-eager, Billy steps into the recess.  And -- \ntwo spiked, latticed gates close on his arm! \nHarry grabs the gates before they snap closed, inches from skewering Billy's flesh and bone!  He keeps them open, his sinews straining. \nHARRY Grab the files! \nBilly reaches in and pulls out a handful of the files. As he steps out of range. Harry lets go and the gates close with a CLANG! \nBILLY Jesus! \nHe slams the files down.  He's trembling. \nBILLY I could have lost my fucking hands. \nHARRY That would have kept you out of the Magic Circle. (he studies the files) Which was presumably the idea. (a beat) These are about Nix. \nHarry takes a sheaf of papers, and hands them to Billy. \nHARRY You go through these.  Go on! \nReluctantly, Billy does so.  Harry picks up a faded PHOTOGRAPH of the doorway to Nix's HOUSE (with the sigil painted on it) and BUTTERFIELD the child standing in the sun. There are other CULTISTS standing around.  And in the DOORWAY -- a barely visible figure (and all the more intimidating for that) - is NIX. \nHARRY Wait a minute... \nHe stares at the boy's face.  The eyes are clearly different colours. \nHARRY That's Butterfield... \nBILLY (points to nan in) doorway) And who's that? \nON HARRY, staring at the ambiguous presence. \nON THE PHOTOGRAPH of the shadowy figure. \nHARRY At a guess?  The Puritan.  Nix. \nBilly picks up an ETCHING, water-stained and dirty.  It shows a horror we recognize:  a man's HAND pressed into the FLESH of another man's HEAD. \nBILLY Take a look at this. \nHARRY (looking at it) A Nix specialty? \nBilly is getting subtly spooked now.  He puts the etching down and starts to go through others in the series.  We glimpse them as he does so.  In one, a MAN regurgitates a serpentine form made of FLAME.  In another, a MAN stares at his own HAND which is STRIPPED OF FLESH.  There is no bone beneath.  Only a form of solid blackness.  In a third, we see a HEAD with a slit in the middle of the brow, emanating DARKNESS. \nBILLY I don't know any of these tricks... \nHarry studies the etchings. \nHARRY (a slow burn) Maybe they're not tricks. \nBILLY (mystified) I mean, there's no instructions-- (realizes what Harry said) What do you mean, they're not tricks? \nHARRY What did Vinovich say? Something about walking a path between -- \nBILLY Trickery and divinity.  Yeah, he says that all the time. \nHARRY That's because he knew.  He'd seen these files and knew. \nBILLY Knew what? \nOut of the corner of his eye. Harry sees a motion between the book-stacks.  Billy frowns.  Harry puts his fingers to his lips.  Gestures for Billy to take cover. Billy backs away. Harry slowly turns in the direction of the motion. \nSomething eerily sepulchral is gliding between the stacks.  A figure in a straight-jacket with his head bowed. \nHarry takes out his gun. \nBilly disappears around the back of one of the stacks. Harry goes after the apparition. \nThe TRACK is completely silent. \nSuddenly, the creature appears behind Billy!  It looks up, its face that of a psychotic:  burning eyes, manic smile. \nIt tears open its straight-jacket and reaches for Billy, who backs away. \nBILLY Harry! \nHe starts towards Harry.  Dorothea goes after him and catches hold of his arm.  Her expression is a mingling of fascination and dread, as Harry gets his fingers under the casket lid and pulls. \nInside, Swann's corpse. \nVALENTIN Are you satisfied now? \nHARRY No. \nHarry holds Valentin back with one hand, and puts his finger into the corpse's mouth. \nDOROTHEA Harry? \nHARRY It's all right.  It's not hurting... \nHe now has four fingers in Swann's mouth and seizes hold of his lower jaw.  It cracks -- \n-- and comes away in a little rain of plaster and latex. \nHARRY ...plaster doesn't bleed. \nHe tosses the jaw to Valentin. \nHARRY (to Dorothea) It looks like you're not a widow after all. \nINT. SWANN'S MANSION - STUDY - NIGHT \nHarry interrogates Valentin in a white fury, while Dorothea binds Harry's hand. \nHARRY You rigged the illusion to fail, right? \nVALENTIN Yes. \nHARRY You paid off the doctor.  You set up the fake body.  Yes? \nVALENTIN Yes. \nHARRY And then... because I was getting too close to something -- (at Dorothea) --or someone, you called Swann \nVALENTIN I tried to pay you off. \nHARRY Was that Swann's idea? \nVALENTIN No.  It was mine.  I didn't want any more bloodshed. That's why we went to all this trouble, so there'd be no one for Nix to come after. \nHARRY Nix is dead and buried, for fuck's sake. \nVALENTIN Haven't you seen enough to know that doesn't matter? \nON HARRY.  He looks as though he's beginning to think maybe Nix's resurrection is plausible. \nHARRY I want to see Swann face to face. \nVALENTIN Why don't you leave this alone? Let everybody think it's over? \nDOROTHEA What about me? \nVALENTIN Nix was never interested in you. It was always Swann. \nA beat. \nHARRY (to Dorothea) Maybe Valentin's right.  We should let it alone. \nA BELL starts to TOLL- \nHARRY (con't.) He went to all that trouble to be dead.  Maybe we should let him stay that way. \nThe TOLLING carries over into \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY \nWE CRANE DOWN from a high angle on a GRAVE, surrounded by MOURNERS.  The graveside service has just ended, and the Mourners are beginning to disperse.  Dorothea is there amongst them, of course.  So are several faces we recognize: Vinovich, Wilder, Billy Who, Swann's Stage Manager, his Dancers, his Technicians.  There are also several members of the PRESS, and thirty or fourty other Mourners, some of whom, to judge by their dress and manner, are also illusionists. \nHarry stands some distance from the crowd, watching (hidden) from the doorway of a mausoleum.  His eyes are on Dorothea as she goes amongst the Mourners, receiving unheard words of condolesence. \nEXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY \nThe standee of Swann is being demolished by two WORKERS. They are taking hammers to it, smashing it to pieces. \nINT. WILTERN THEATRE - STAGE - DAY \nThe stage is starkly lit with working lights, the auditorium in darkness.  Swann's equipment - including the partially dismantled Dragon's head - is heaped on the stage. \nValentin wanders through the boxes to the place where Swann \"died.\"  He stares down at the BLOOD on the stage. \nEXT. WILTERN THEATRE - DAY \nTHE 1st WORKER throws the cut-out head of Swann's standee down into the street. \n1ST WORKER Watch out! \nOn the HEAD, as it strikes the sidewalk at somebody's feet. We don't see who. \nSWANN (V.O.) They'll never find out. \nHarry looks up. \nSvanrt is hovering in the air above him.  The veins in his temples bulge and throb.  This trick requires a lot of concentration. \nHARRY Look, Ma, no wires. \nSWANN You shouldn't have followed me, D'Amour. \nHARRY How the fuck do you do that? \nSWANN Now I'm going to have to kill you. \nHARRY I don't think so.  You need me alive. \nSWANN Why?  So you can fuck my wife? \nSwann swoops down towards Harry, who levels his gun. \nHARRY Be careful.  Funerals make me trigger-happy. \nSwann stops, inches from the ground. \nHARRY You know, it's such a fucking waste.  You can do shit most of us can only dream about, and you go around pretending it's some trick. \nSWANN Illusionists get. Las Vegas contracts, D'Amour.  Magicians get burned. \nHARRY Or murdered, like Nix. \nSWANN He deserved it. \nHARRY Maybe he doesn't see it that way. Maybe he's digging his way out of the hole you put him right now.  That's what you're hiding away from, isn't it? \nSWANN I did it for Dorothea. \nHARRY Oh yeah? \nSWANN Now that I'm dead, the spotlight's off her. \nHarry grabs Swann, literally pulling him down to earth. Now they're face to face.  Eye to eye.  Swann, for all his posturing, is afraid. \nHARRY So Nix won't come looking for her? \nSWANN It's me betrayed him. \nHARRY And she shot him I  I think that'd piss me off if I were Nix. \nSWANN (despairing) I don't know what else to do. \nHARRY Help me. \nOn Swann, his face a churning mass of rage and fear. \nHARRY Listen.  If he's back from the dead, then he is some kind of god. And he'll find you, wherever the fuck you are. And if he's just another phony Messiah, then you can stage the greatest come-back in history. \nON Swann.  This doesn't sound like such a terrible idea. \nEXT. NIX'S HOUSE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA car comes to a halt outside the house, where six vehicles are already gathered.  The SNAKE-HANDLING Cultist gets out. SNAKES seethe out of the open car door. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - VARIOUS - LATE AFTERNOON \nWe MOVE THROUGH the shadowy interior, catching sight of several CULTISTS as we go.  They all have looks of barely suppressed ecstasy on their faces. \nWe are moving towards the Sanctum, and it's getting darker. A MATCH is struck, and an OIL-FLAME sputters into life.  We see NORMAN'S gleaming face. On the wall is a PICTURE of Nix, floating over a scene of apocalyptic destruction. \nNorman brushes away thirteen years' accrual of DIRT. Beneath, Nix's expression is as rabid and terrifying as ever.  Norman grins. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON \nA small, garishly-lit liquor store.  Harry's car pulls into the lot.  Swann gets out, his disguise back on. Heads into the store.  Harry, agitated and impatient, follows him. \nINT. LIQUOR STORE - LATE AFTERNOON \nSwann is at the cashier's desk, with a bottle of cheap brandy. \nSWANN Is this the best brandy you've got? \nCASHIER If that's what's on the shelves. \nSwann produces a thousand dollar bill out of thin air. \nSWANN Can you change a thousand for me? \nCASHIER (amazed) You're shittin' me. \nHARRY Can we go? \nSWANN No. (a beat) At the end... when we had him cornered, he got into my head. He showed me what we really look like, when the veneer's gone.  Jelly. Shit... \nHARRY And you believed him? \nSWANN I saw it with my own fucking eyes! See, that's his best trick.  No illusions.  Just the truth. (he looks at Harry) Are you ready for that? \nHarry grabs the brandy bottle from Swann. \nSWANN Hey! \nHarry drinks. \nSWANN Thought not. \nEXT. SWANN'S MANSION - NIGHT \nPAN DOWN from the palms to Harry's car, outside the front door. \nINT. SWANN'S MANSION - VARIOUS - NIGHT \nHarry puts his head in the study, the library, the bedroom. \nHARRY Dorothea? \nNow he's on the landing.  Swann's below. \nSWANN She's not here. \nHarry spots Valentin's BLOOD on the carpet. \nHARRY Did she know where Nix was buried? \nSWANN No. \nHARRY Who else did?  Did Valentin? \nSWANN Yes. \nHARRY Jesus! \nEXT. DESERT HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nButterfield's SEDAN crosses the desert, under a sky full of stars. \nINT. BUTTERFIELD'S SEDAN - NIGHT \nValentin drives.  Butterfield and Dorothea are in the back. Dorothea is handcuffed. \nHe has a bag open at his feet.  One by one he takes out a series of extraordinary instruments.  Dorothea looks on, confounded. \nBUTTERFIELD Like the look of these?  I made them myself, to set him free. \nDOROTHEA Why did you wait so long? \nBUTTERFIELD I didn't have the skill to resurrect him.  I had to teach myself.  And that took time. \nDOROTHEA And you think he'll be in a fit state to resurrect, after thirteen years? \nBUTTERFIELD If he was just a man like me, then no.  But he's not. \nDOROTHEA What is he? \nBUTTERFIELD Maybe he'll show you. \nON DOROTHEA, terror in her eyes. \nEXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nNow there are a dozen vehicles parked around the house. Through the windows, the flickering of oil-lamp FLAMES. \nThere is a low, ominous CHANT floating from the house. \nIt has no words, but it is steadily BUILDING in intensity. We DRIFT towards the front door. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT \nNow we move down the passageway to the Meditation Room. \nInside, SEVENTEEN CULTISTS kneel in a circle.  They are all CUTTING OFF THEIR HAIR, and throwing it into the FIRE that blazes in the centre of the circle.  They hack indiscriminately, with KNIVES, SCISSORS and RAZORS, their eyes wild.  BLOOD runs down their faces and necks from nicked ears and scalps. \nAnd still the CHANT BUILDS, and BUILDS... \nNORMAN He will come!  He will come! He will come! \nEXT. DESERT - NIX'S GRAVE - NIGHT \nWide.  A few rocks, and emptiness. \nThe headlamps of Butterfield's sedan burn in the darkness, illuminating the dig.  Valentin is in the grave, digging. \nON Butterfield, as he stands at the edge of the hole, watching the work.  Dorothea stands a yard or two behind him. \nINT. HARRY'S CAR - NIGHT \nIndecision is written all over Swann's face:  to help or not to help? \nHARRY (V.O.) Swann! \nHe decides.  Gets out. \nEXT. NIX'S GRAVE - MIGHT \nSwann goes to the graveside, terrified. \nHARRY Give me a hand.  I got Valentin. \nTogether, Harry and Swann lift Valentin out of the grave and lay him in the blaze of the headlamps. \nVALENTIM He's got Dorothea. \nSWANN And Nix? \nVALENTIN Him too. \nHARRY We've got to get you to a hospital. \nVALENTIN Don't bother. \nHARRY Shut up.  We've lost enough lives already. \nVALENTIN I'm sorry, D'Amour... \nHARRY What about? \nVALENTIN ... Looks like you're going... to lose... one more. \nValentin dies. \nHARRY (despairing) ... no... \nSWANN He's better off this way. \nHARRY (furious) Nobody's better off this wav! \nSWANN You don't get it, do you? We're shit. D'Amour. \nHe puts his foot beneath Valentin's body.  It rolls back into Nix's grave. \nSWANN That's where we're all going. \nHARRY In my time, and nobody else's. \nON THE EMPTY GRAVE, as we HEAR the SOUND of Harry and Swann getting into the car.  The doors SLAM.  The CAR LIGHTS retreat.  The grave is left to DARKNESS. \nEXT. NIX'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThe house is silent now. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAYS - NIGHT \nWe TRACK through the house.  The CULTISTS, all Seventeen of them, stand in the passageways, looking toward Nix's sanctum. \nON THE SANCTUM DOOR.  Butterfield emerges.  He is wearing WHITE now. \nBUTTERFIELD Do you wish him to be amongst us? \nCULTISTS Yes... \nBUTTERFIELD Will you come to him on your knees? \nCULTISTS Yes... \nBUTTERFIELD Be ready. \nNow we see that the Cultists have BOTTLES in their hands. With looks of ecstatic fervour on their faces, they SMASH the bottles to the ground at their bare feet. Then they pick up MORE BOTTLES, and SMASH them, littering the ground with razor sharp pieces of GLASS. \nON Butterfield, smiling.  He steps back into the Sanctum. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT \nHIGH, WIDE SHOT of the room, as Butterfield approaches the BODY of Nix.  It lies on a table, surrounded by bowls of OIL. Bandages, soaked in oil, are laid over its limbs.  Beside its head, Butterfield's INSTRUMENTS are laid out. \nON Dorothea, crouched in the corner of the room, terrified as she watches Butterfield remove the multi- part MASK screwed into Nix's face.  He works with surgical precision. \nDOROTHEA Listen.  You've got everything you want.  You don't need me. .. \nA piece of the mask comes away from the cheek.  A subtle POWER plucks at dust around the room, disturbing it minutely. We CUT CLOSE to Dorothea's face throughout this sequence (on occasion her eyeball fills the screen) as she sees these signs of disturbance in the ether, growing in magnitude. \nBUTTERFIELD No, but he will.  After what you did to him. \nHe pulls a piece of the mask from Nix's mouth. \nBUTTERFIELD He'll want vengeance.  Simple PS that. \nThe Cultists all face the Sanctum door, awaiting instruction. \nNIX Will you suffer to come unto me? \nOne by one, the Cultists fall to their knees.  We never see flesh pierced by broken glass.  But we HEAR IT, and see the agony on the Cultist's faces.  They start to sob. \nThen, Nix appears in the doorway, mostly hidden by shadow. \nNIX I've come back to share the wisdom of the grave.  Will you hear it? \nCULTISTS Yes... yes... \nNIX Follow me then. \nHe steps out of the doorway.  The Cultists let out sobs of adoration.  Nix locks at Dorothea. \nNIX Do I know you, child? \nHe reaches for her.  Pulls her close to his body. Dorothea keeps her self-possession; but only just. \nNIX Oh yes... I do, don't I?  No gun this time, child? (a beat) Where's Swann? \nDOROTHEA I don't know where he is. \nNix picks her up, so that her feet are inches off the ground. \nNIX He'll come.  We've got unfinished business, he and I. \nThen he carries her down the passageway to the Meditation Room, walking on the glass, apparently indifferent to the wounds he's receiving. \nThe Cultists follow. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT \nNix strides into the middle of the room. \nNIX (whispered to Dorothea) Something terrible's going to happen.  But if you hold on to me, very tight, you may live a little longer. \nThe Cultists enter the room, knees and hands BLOODY. \nNIX (to Cultists) Are you ready for my wisdom? \nCULTISTS Tell us... tell us... \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM - NIGHT \nHarry pushes open the window, and climbs in.  Swann follows. He is frozen by the memory of what happened here. \nON SWANN, as the TRACK fills with eerie ECHOES of that terrible event.  Nix's SCREAMS.  The GUN-SHOTS.  The sound of the SCREWS GRINDING into Nix's flesh. \nSWANN (in terrified awe) This is where we killed him. \nHARRY (looking at table) You didn't try hard enough. \nSWANN I can't... I can't go any further... \nHarry nods, and gently detaches his arm from Swann's panicked grip.  He crosses to the door. \nSuddenly. Butterfield reaches out of the darkness, and catches hold of Harry's leg. throwing him to the ground. \nHe has one of the INSTRUMENTS in his hand.  He STABS at Harry, striking the ground between Harry's legs. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT \nNIX Here is my wisdom. \nHe stamps on the ground.  CRACKS spread from his foot in all directions. ON THE CULTISTS, amazed by this manifestation of power. \nBARBARA Show us. Puritan. \nNORMAN Yes, show us! \nALL Show us!  Show us! \nWith a ROAR, a PIT four or five feet across opens up beneath Nix and Dorothea.  Nix HOVERS over it.  It's utterly dark; perhaps bottomless. \nDorothea SCREAMS! \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - SANCTUM- - NIGHT \nHearing Dorothea's CRY, Harry looks back towards the passageway.  Butterfield pulls the instrument out of the ground and stabs at Harry a second time.  But Swann catches hold of his arm. \nSWANN (to Harry) Whatever he's doing to her, stop him! \nAnd Harry's up and away -- \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT \n-- he dashes over the glass -- \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT \nHARRY (to Dorothea) I've got to help him. \nDOROTHEA You can't. \nHARRY Nix has got to have a weak spot. Everybody's got a fucking weak spot. \nA NOISE. He turns, and suddenly -- \nButterfield is there!  His face is horribly burned, but he's still very much alive. \nBUTTERFIELD Bastard! \nHe launches himself at Harry, driving them both back into the BROKEN GLASS.  A FIGHT ensues, carrying them out into the Passageway. \nNix has Swann in a bear-hug. \nNIX Will you help me? \nA beat.  Then Swann nods. \nSWANN Yes. \nNix lets him go. \nNIX You know I'll kill you when we're done.  I have to. \nSWANN Yes. \nNIX But until then... it's you and me... the way it always was. \nSWANN Yes. \nDorothea, at the doorway, watches this bizarre exchange. Swann's eyes flicker towards her.  Nix turns. \nNIX Wait... you still feel something for that bitch? \nSWANN No! \nNIX Liar! \nNix makes a gesture, and Swann is flung against the wall, pinned there like a fly, legs off the ground. \nNIX Will!  You!  Never!  Learn!? \nWith each word, Nix almost casually throws a gesture in Swann's direction, and though there is six feet between them, they have the force of terrible blows.  One to the ribs. They CRACK.  One to the face.  It BLEEDS.  One to the legs, one to the arms.  They all BREAK.  Then Nix turns towards Dorothea. \nNIX She's just flesh, Swannnie-boy. I'll show you! \nHe moves towards Dorothea.  Swann falls to the ground, broken. \nSWANN Harry! \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - PASSAGEWAY - NIGHT \nThe fight between Butterfield and Harry continues. \nSWANN (V.O.) Harry!  Stop him! \nHarry looks up.  Sees Dorothea retreating from the door, and running off into the darkness. \nButterfield comes at Harry again.  Harry's got no more time for this creep.  He delivers Butterfield a backhand swipe, and Butterfield lands face down in the glass.  We don't see the impact.  HEARING it's enough. \nHarry looks down at the body.  Then -- \nNIX (V.O.) Where is she? \nHarry turns. \nNix is on him like a luoaernaut. treading on Butterfield's body as he comes at Harry! \nNIX Where did she go? \nNix GRABS hold of Harry's head with one hand and PRESSES the fingers of -the other hand against Harry's TEMPLES. He struggles to get free, but Nix is simply too powerful. \nNix's fingers slowly SLIDE BENEATH the skin of Harry's temples.  As before, there's no blood. \nNIX You've got Swann's disease. You think a little courage, a little love, and it'll all be all right. Wrong! \nHis fingers slide all the way in! \nHARRY Oh God! \nHarry wrests himself free of Nix, and stumbles away. His eyes are BLOOD-RED.  Nix is a few yards behind him. \nNIX Tell me where she is... and I'll make it go away... \nHarry is reeling around in the grip of a nightmare. \nHARRY'S P.O.V. \nThe apocalyptic images on the walls seem to move!  A face SCREAMS!  FIRE blossoms! \nNix's face darkens as it MORPHS.  And the flesh in the middle of his brow UNFOLDS, revealing a dark, pulsating THIRD EYE. \nNIX (to Harry) What are you looking at? \nON DOROTHEA, who has gone to the door of the Meditation Room and now slips inside. \nON HARRY, staring up at Nix. \nON DOROTHEA, re-emerging from the Meditation Room.  In her hand, Harry's GUN.  Harry looks round at her. \nHARRY (points to his brow) There... there! \nON NIX, as he looks up at Dorothea. \nON DOROTHEA, as she raises the GUN.  She FIRES. \nThe bullet STRIKES Nix's FOREHEAD.  He sinks to his knees, BLOOD pouring down his face from the hole where his third EYE used to be. \nON HARRY, as Nix's mind-hold falters.  He leans against the wall, shaking. \nDOROTHEA Harry? \nHARRY I'm okay.  I'm okay. \nHarry opens his eyes.  Looks up at her. \nHARRY'S P.O.V. \nThe last of the MORPHING fades.  He sees Dorothea as she actually is.  Dorothea goes down to comfort him, and they embrace. \nSuddenly, a ROAR from Nix.  They look towards him -- \n-- it isn't over. \nOne last, terrifying transformation is overtaking Nix as he kneels in the GLASS.  His sallow flesh is running in STREAMS up his body towards the DARK HOLE in the middle of his forehead -- \nNIX One... last... illusion... \n-- his humanity is disappearing, vanishing into the vortex of the bullet wound. \nDOROTHEA Oh my God. \nHarry and Dorothea start to get up... \nNix is no longer human.  He is a shape of gleaming DARKNESS, stripped of features.  He opens his mouth, the only visible element on his body is his toothed maw, which looses an utterly inhuman SHRIEK! \nSWANN (V.O.) ... D'Amour... \nHarry glances through the door into the Meditation Room. Swann is on the threshold. \nNix RISES now.  He is a terrifying spectacle, his bulk somehow more intimidating than ever in this simplified form. \nHe comes at Dorothea, who has no choice but to back away into the Meditation Room. \nINT. NIX'S HOUSE - MEDITATION ROOM - NIGHT \nThe pit still yawns in the middle of the floor. Dorothea is backed towards it by Nix. \nWhen Nix SPEAKS, his voice is not remotely human.  It is DEMONIACAL. \nNIX I am the purest of the pure.  I am the darkest of the dark... \nHarry is at the door now, starting towards Nix. \nSWANN Harry.  You can't kill him. \nHarry crouches beside Swann. \nHARRY (whispers) He did something with the ground. \nSWANN Yes? \nHARRY Can you do it? \nSWANN I don't know. \nHARRY Try. \nON DOROTHEA.  She's a couple of yards from the pit now. \nNIX (V.O.) I'm beyond Heaven.  I'm beyond Hell. \nSuddenly, Harry lunges at Nix, grabbing hold of his legs. Nix topples. \nON SWANN, who puts his hands on the ground.  Closes his eyes. \nA wave of LIQUIFICATION runs through the ground from Swann's broken fingers -- \n-- the Cultists' bodies MOVE in the softening ground, like corpses in surf, and ROLL towards the pit, their dead faces resurfacing -- \nBarbara's body floats past Nix, and disappears over the edge of the pit. \n", "test1_input": "EXT. SANTA MONICA BLVD. - DAY \nA white SEDAN glides along the boulevard.  At the wheel, Valentin.  Beside him, Harry. \nINT. SEDAN - DAY \nHarry is eating a burrito and sipping coffee. \nHARRY Whose is the car? \nVALENTIN Mine. \nHARRY Nah.  You're driving it too carefully. \nVALENTIN (sparring) Maybe I just bought it. \nHARRY Somebody's been smoking in here for months. \nHe pulls open the ashtray. Pulls out a cigar-butt. \nHARRY Havanas.  You're not the smoker.  So who is? \nVALENTIN (laughs) You could almost pass for a detective, D'Amour. (a beat) I work for the best illusionist in the world. \nHARRY Philip Swann? \nVALENTIN You know of him? \nHARRY I saw him in Vegas once. \nVALENTIN Are you a gambling man? \nHARRY When I can afford to lose. Swann's quite a magician. \nVALENTIN Never call him that.  He's strictly an illusionist. \nHARRY What's the difference? \nVALENTIN Illusions are trickery. Magicians do it for real. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - GATES - DAY \nThe sedan turns into a driveway. \nEXT. HOLLYWOOD CEMETERY - DAY \nThe sun beats down on a pristine panorama of palms and white marble tombs.  Harry and Valentin walk towards a large mausoleum. \nHARRY Any movie stars buried here? \nVALENTIN Probably. \nHARRY It's not a bad place.  Warm. Great view. \nVALENTIN I don't think the dead much care. \nHARRY Are you sure? \nVALENTIN Are you a believer, then? \nValentin gives him an inquisitive look. \nHARRY I've signed on for them all in my time.  Hindu.  Catholic. You can't have too many saviours. \nHarry's gaze is on the mausoleum now; or rather on the woman in white standing in its cool shadows:  Dorothea Swann.  She wears a wide-brimmed hat. \nHARRY Who is she? \nVALENTIN Swann's wife. \nCUT TO: \nVALENTIN sitting on the mausoleum steps reading a book.  He glances up. \nHarry and Dorothea are wandering between the graves, deep in conversation. \nDOROTHEA I want you to help me help my husband.  I know he's in some kind of trouble.  And it's something to do with the man you saw murdered. \nHARRY Did your husband know Quaid? \nDOROTHEA Yes.  They weren't close, but they saw each other once in a while.  I think Philip believes all that stuff with the tarot cards. \nHARRY You don't? \nDOROTHEA I think we make our own futures. \nHarry makes an approving MURMUR. \nHARRY What's the connection? \nDOROTHEA (covering now, but well) I don't exactly know. Philip doesn't like to talk about the past. \n", "test1_true": "Dorothea stops talking.  Takes off her sunglasses.  Her gaze is troubled, but direct.  There is an attraction between the two of them that simmers beneath the dialogue. \nDOROTHEA He's a secretive man. \nHARRY And you don't ask questions? \nDOROTHEA We don't share our lives the way a lot of people do. \nHARRY Does that mean...? \nDOROTHEA We haven't slept in the same bed for years. \nHARRY But obviously you still care what happens to him. \nDOROTHEA We wouldn't be having this conversation if I didn't. Swann's one of the most remarkable men alive. \nHarry, frowns. \nDOROTHEA You don't believe me. \nHARRY He's an illusionist.  It's not exactly brain surgery. \nDorothea stares at him. \nHARRY Sorry.  You asked. \nDOROTHEA No.  You're right.  He could have been something more. Maybe a lot more.  But people get lost.  Even good people. Too much fame.  Too much money, \nHARRY Where do I sign? \nDorothea LAUGHS lightly. \nDOROTHEA Will you take the job, Mr. D'Amour? \nHARRY Harry. \nDOROTHEA Harry. \nHARRY I'm no bodyguard. \nDOROTHEA That's not what I'm asking for. I want somebody who can find out what Philip saw in those damn cards. And stop it from happening. \nHARRY When do you want me to start? \nDOROTHEA Come to the show with me. Tonight I want you to see him with an audience.  They love him. \nHARRY Do you? \nThe question catches Dorothea off guard. \nDOROTHEA I didn't marry him for love, Mr. D'Amour.  Tonight? \nHARRY Sure. \nDorothea makes a little smile, and walks away.  Harry watches her go, exhaling an appreciative breath at the sight of her departing figure. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

I'm late. \nLOOMIS Call me tomorrow. \nHARRY There's other guys as good as me, Loomis. \nLOOMIS Yeah.  But not as cheap.

SWANN'S MANSION - DOROTHEA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nShe sits up on her bed, dressed in a silk robe, and nothing else, drinking a SCOTCH, talking on the phone. The primary source of illumination is the massive T.V. set in the wall opposite the bed. \nDOROTHEA Harry... I know it's late. \nINTERCUT PHONE CONVERSATION \nThere should be a subtle eroticism pervading this exchange. Both of them on beds, in different bedrooms. Each aroused by the other's voice, and frustrated not to be able to see and touch them. \nHARRY That's okay. \nAs he speaks, Harry scrawls Jennifer Desiderio on the title page of the Gideon's Bible beside the bed. \nDOROTHEA How did it go today? \nHARRY I went up to the Magic Castle. You were right.  He didn't have a lot of fans up there. \nCUT TO: \nINT. SWANN'S MANSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nValentin, on the kitchen PHONE, is listening in. \nDOROTHEA (V.O.) They were jealous of him. \nHARRY (V.O.) Why?  Because he had you? \nBACK TO: \nINTERCUTTING: HARRY - DOROTHEA - VALENTIN \nDOROTHEA He... didn't have me..  I told you- \nHARRY You didn't marry him for love. \nDOROTHEA'S BEDROOM \nShe's a little uncomfortable now. \nHARRY So why did you marry him? \nDOROTHEA That's my business. Harry. \nHARRY Just curious. (a beat) Back to business.  Ever heard of a man called Nix? (silence) Dorothea? \nDOROTHEA Yes... I'm here.  And no.  I don't know the name. \nHARRY What about Jennifer Desiderio? \nDOROTHEA It doesn't ring a bell.  I have to go. \nHARRY Okay.  I'll keep digging. \nDOROTHEA (uneasy) Yes.  You do that. \nShe puts down the phone, and swallows a mouthful of scotch. She's shaking.  She gets up.  Paces the room. Then she picks up the phone again. \nINT.

QUAID'S OFFICES - STAIRWELL - NIGHT \nThe Tarot Card and Crystal Readings sign is dark now. Harry heads up the stairs, past the PHOTOGRAPHS, to the door of Quaid's Waiting Room. It has been locked and taped by the police.  Harry has come prepared.  He takes out a small crowbar and levers off the locks. \nINT. QUAID'S OFFICES - WAITING/FORTUNE TELLING ROOMS - NIGHT \nHarry enters, FLASHLIGHT on.  He crosses the Waiting Room and enters the Fortune-Telling Room where Quaid died.  On the TRACK -- a remote, eerie presence -- we hear Quaid's SOBS, Miller's SHOUTS, and, as Harry's flashlight illuminates the blood-spattered table: \nBUTTERFIELD (V.O.) If you watch very closely, you can sometimes see the soul escaping. \nHarry is spooked.  He starts to search the room, opening cabinets and drawers.  Quaid's hordes of mystical bric-a-brac are stashed everywhere.

Jennifer Desiderio, and an address.  He pockets the book.  Then, sensing a presence behind him, he pulls out his gun and whirls around, his flashlight beam revealing -- \n-- Valentin! \nHARRY (CONT'D) What the fuck are you doing here? \nVALENTIN Looking for you.  I tried the hotel. \nHARRY Why'd you come here? \nVALENTIN You're a detective, with no clues. Where else are you going to look? I'm going to keep this brief. (he takes out an envelope) Here's thirty thousand dollars. \nHARRY What for? \nVALENTIN A ticket home, \nHARRY You didn't hire me.  She did. If she wants me off the job, I want to hear it from her. \nVALENTIN She doesn't want to see you. She's had enough pain.  Enough churning over the past.  She wants it all left alone. \nHARRY Left alone?  Somebody's been murdered. \nVALENTIN Yes.  It's regrettable \nHARRY Fuck regrettable!  I want to know why. \nVALENTIN What for?  You need to stay busy? \nHARRY (a confession) I like to know why things happen. \nVALENTIN Why people die? (shakes his head) Give it up, D'Amour.  Go home. \nHARRY No. \nHarry crosses to the door, brushing past Valentin. \nVALENTIN Don't try and see her, D'Amour. Just leave her alone.  Let her heal. \nHe glances back at Valentin. \nHARRY Lock up, will you? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM, PASADENA - DAY \nON THE ADDRESS BOOK, in Harry's hands. \nHarry looks up - with some surprise - not at a house but at a building, the sign on which reads, \"St. Luke's Sanitorium\". \nINT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - DAY \nThe place is bland and functional throughout, the walls decorated with sun-faded reproductions of great paintings. Nothing disturbing.  Harry is talking to D.A. TOFFLER - black, fortyish, softly spoken - and a Nurse. \nTOFFLER Jennifer's only ever had one visitor. \nHARRY A Mister Quaid? \nTOFFLER Right.  And he's dead, isn't he?  I saw it on the news. Jennifer doesn't know.  And frankly, this isn't the best tine for her to be told. \nHARRY I won't say anything. \nINT. ST. LUKE'S SANITORIUM - CORRIDORS AND WARD - DAY \nToffler excorts Harry through -the place.  There are distressing scenes on every side.  Nothing melodramatic no screaming, no fits.  Just a subtle, pervasive air of despair. Blank, empty FACES in blank, empty rooms. \nTOFFLER Jennifer's been with us four years. She was coming on nicely. But just the last month or so, she's worse than ever. \nHARRY What's her problem? \nTOFFLER She has no real grip on reality. \nHARRY (a joke) Does anybody? \nTOFFLER (deadly serious) Oh yes.  We have to agree what's real and what's not. That's what holds us together. \nHARRY And what does Jennifer think's real? \nThey've come to french windows, which are wide open. Sitting outside in the sun is Jennifer, with her back to us. \nTOFFLER (quietly) Jennifer thinks the Devil's coming for her.

SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT- \nDorothea pours herself a drink, while Harry spreads the PHOTOS and the PAPERS from the repository on the table. \nHARRY Nix ran some kind of cult, right? Some kind of Charlie Manson deal? \nDOROTHEA It was more than that, I think. \nHARRY He was the real thing, right? \nDOROTHEA Swann said he could do stuff, yes. \nHARRY Stuff? \nDOROTHEA He could get into people's heads. Make them see things. Terrible things.  And he could levitate. Juggle fire. \nHARRY He taught all this to Swann? \nDOROTHEA Some or it. \nINT. SWANN'S MANSION - HALLWAY OUTSIDE STUDY - NIGHT \nValentin is listening at the door. \nINT. SWANN'S MANSION- STUDY-- NIGHT- \nHARRY So Swann was performing magic. not illusions? (Dorothea nods) And what?  You thought he should be using it to cure cancer, not making millions. \nDOROTHEA I told you -- \nHARRY Too much fame.  Yeah, I guess that'd turn anybody's head. Including yours. \nDOROTHEA No. \nHARRY You said you weren't with him for love. \nDOROTHEA I wasn't. \nHARRY What then? \nDOROTHEA I was grateful to him.  I owed him my life.  And he loved me. He couldn't always show it, but he felt it. \nHARRY He thought Nix was coming back, didn't he? \nDorothea is pouring herself another drink.  The glass slips from her hand.  It SHATTERS.  Harry goes to help her.  They stoop together, very close.  The sexual attraction is almost palpable. Dorothea cuts herself on a shard of glass. \nDOROTHEA Shit! \nThey are very close to each other. \nHARRY (reassuring) It's okay. \nDOROTHEA No it isn't.  You can't help me. \nHARRY (tenderly) I'm here, aren't I? \nHe kisses her.

Walls lined with mirrors, and warm, flattering lighting, bathing the naked forms of Dorothea and Harry as they make love, sitting on the floor. \nIt is a deeply passionate, but slow, sensual coupling. \nINT./EXT.

He's startled, to say the least. \nDOROTHEA I was twelve.  Nix took me hostage, to get Swann to come to him. \nHARRY (realizing) And they all came... \nDOROTHEA Yes. \nHARRY Quaid and Jennifer-- \nDOROTHEA And Pimm and Swann.

He has his gun. \nHARRY Valentin? \nDorothea appears behind him. \nDOROTHEA Harry?  Wait! \nHarry's at the bottom of the stairs now.  Across the hall, in a passageway, an eerie SILHOUETTE.  We can make out no detail of clothing or face. \nHARRY What the hell-? \nSuddenly, the shadowy FIGURE comes at Harry.  A BLAST of ENERGY bursts against Harry's face.  As it breaks against his skin, we see (for three frames or so) a glimpse of Harry's skull. \nHARRY (in pain) Aah! \nHarry FIRES at the figure.  The shadows fold up around the Stranger like an origami puzzle.  He's gone. \nDOROTHEA It's him!  It's Nix! \nHarry goes out into the passageway. \nHARRY Valentin!  Get some lights on! \nAs if in reply to the command, a burst of vivid white FIRE erupts behind Harry.  He swings round to see the Stranger \"unfolding\" out of the shadows again, defying physics and physiology to do so.  The FIRE is at his feet, like a serpent writhing on the ground.  It comes at Harry.  Harry FIRES at it, but it comes at him faster still, rising to burn Harry's leg.  He retreats, the FIRE racing after him. He makes for a door, and flings it open.  He's in -- \nINT. SWANN'S MANSION - CASKET ROOM - NIGHT \nThe FIRE follows him across the ground and STRIKES his hand. Harry drops the GUN.  Looks up to see the Stranger in the doorway, arm raised to will the fire-serpent on.  But then, he hesitates.  Harry glances round, and sees that the Stranger - whose face is still a dark smear - is staring at the CASKET. \nHARRY Somebody you know? \nDorothea appears behind the Stranger.  Sees Harry, burned and sweating, cornered against the casket. \nDOROTHEA Oh my God! \nThe Stranger looks round.  Harry snatches up the GUN, supporting his burned hand with -his good hand.  Levels the gun at the Stranger.  The FIRE raises its head, like a cobra. \nHARRY Which goes first?  My face or your heart? \nThe Stranger draws a deep breath.  The Fire-Serpent withers and dies. \nDOROTHEA Who in God's name are you? \nShe reaches for the Stranger, who simply folds up again; gone into darkness.  The WIND blows through the house, masking his exit. \nDOROTHEA Are you all right? \nHARRY Find Valentin!  Find him!  Get him in here! \nDorothea disappears.  Harry takes one of the candle-holders and jams it under the casket lid.  Wood splinters.  He starts to force off the lid. \nValentin and Dorothea enter. \nVALENTIN What are you doing?  This is sacrilege. \n", "test3_id": 53}

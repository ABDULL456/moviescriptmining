Sykes looks at these harmless wimps... then at Cassandra. 
SYKES You okay? 
CASSANDRA (dazed, but all right) Yeah... 
And he charges out the adjoining office door. 
EXT.  FIRE ESCAPE - ENCOUNTERS - NIGHT 
Harcourt and Kipling bang down the metal stairs.  Jetson is ten feet above them.  Sykes flies out onto the fire escape, a few steps behind Jetson.  A POLICE CAR SIREN is HEARD arriving O.S. 
EXT.  ALLEY - BEHIND ENCOUNTER - NIGHT 
Two UNIFORMED OFFICERS bound from their unit and run into the back entrance of the club, leaving the unit running. 
Two seconds later, Harcourt and Kipling leap down from the fire escape, find themselves near the unit. 
HARCOURT Here! 
He throws the suitcase into the passenger side door, jumps in.  Kipling dives in behind the wheel, slams it into gear and floors it. 
Jetson and Sykes hit the ground just as the unit peels out.  Sykes raises the Casull and fires at the fleeing car.  One slug shatters a tail light, others pepper the rear of the trunk, but the car keeps going. 
JETSON This way! 
He indicates the slug-mobile parked nearby.  They race to it, jump in... Sykes driving.  He burns rubber as he pulls out. 
A second arriving police unit pulls into the alley, heading straight for the slug-mobile.  Sykes has to grate between the alley wall and the arriving police unit to get past. 
EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT 
Harcourt and Kipling in the first police unit come thundering down the street zig-zagging through traffic. The slug-mobile is three-quarters of a block behind them. 
INSIDE THE BLACK-AND-WHITE 
Harcourt begins fumbling with the dash switches... eventually hitting the right ones and the roof lights and SIREN blast on. 
EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT 
It looks like a backwards chase, the slug-mobile chasing the howling police car through traffic. 
Jetson alertly eyes the approaching traffic -- calls it out to Sykes the way he was trained at the academy. 
JETSON Slow traffic on your right... you're clear at the left rear... (Sykes changes lanes) Careful, red light ahead... 
With Jetson's help, Sykes is able to dice through the cross-traffic without incident. 
EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT 
The traffic ahead of the police car peels off in response to the approaching lights and SIREN.  Kipling dodges around the stopped traffic easily. 
The same traffic that has pulled over for the police car now starts easing back onto the street, cutting off the slug-mobile. 
INT.  SLUG-MOBILE - NIGHT 
Sykes' expression tells us he's slipped into the same juggernaut mode we saw during the foot chase in the alley. 
JETSON Yellow light ahead turning red... 
But Sykes doesn't slow -- instead he floors it. 
JETSON (continuing; wide- eyed) Red light!  Red light! 
EXT.  WEST SIDE STREET - NIGHT 
Sykes peels around the merging traffic, cuts across the intersection, and continues the chase.  On the wrong side of the road, head-on into traffic. 
Headlights peel off in front of them as they charge along the wrong side.  They eventually catch up to the police unit, racing parallel to it, but with the divider between them.

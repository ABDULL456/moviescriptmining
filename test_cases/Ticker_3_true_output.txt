REILLY Thanks. 
Reilly and Glass turn to Mary who has lost consciousness but is still holding the remote tightly. 
Glass looks up to see T.J. and Bev peeking from around their van. 
GLASS All clear, but we need an ambulance! 
Bev jumps into the van to make the call as T.J. starts limping towards the U-Haul. Schnoz yelps and drops from the van and runs for the U-Haul. 
Reilly cradles Mary in his lap as Glass kneels and removes the remote - the red light stops flashing, then turns off. 
T.J. arrives and looks down at Reilly and Mary, then at the device in the U-Haul. 
T.J. Nice work. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
100   INT. POLICE STATION -SQUAD ROOM - DAY                          100 
The room is back to its usual bustling activity. 
101   INT. POLICE STATION - WINTER'S OFFICE - DAY                    101 
Winters is going through reports on his desk as Reilly enters. Reilly is cleaned up, shaven, haircut, new suit... a new man. 
Winters look up, impressed with the change. 
WINTERS Mayor loves a hero. 
Winters hands Reilly an envelope and a new badge. 
WINTERS (cont.) Just want you wanted. Your promotion, and transfer. 
REILLY Thank you, Captain. 
Winters nods and goes back to his paperwork. 
102   INT. THE CAVE - DAY                                             102 
T.J. and Bev work closely together on a mock-device. T.J. is teaching her the job. They smile warmly at each other. Glass is on the computer. 
Reilly enters. 
BEV Hey, you look great. 
T.J. flinches, but she winks at him to calm him down.    T.J. smiles... no longer threatened. 
Glass doesn't look up from his computer. 
GLASS You're late. 
Glass points to the work station next to him where a Bomb Squad Protocol Program is waiting on the screen. 
Reilly smiles and he sits next to Glass, hands him the transfer papers envelope. 
GLASS (cont.) (softening) Welcome to the family. 
Glass accepts the papers and shakes Reilly's hand. 
REILLY Nice to be here. 
T.J. That feeling won't last long.

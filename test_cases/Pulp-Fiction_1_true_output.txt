Butch slowly inserts the key into the door, quietly opening it. 
INT. BUTCH'S APARTMENT  DAY 
His apartment hasn't been touched. 
He cautiously steps inside, shuts the door and takes a quick look around. Obviously, no one is there. 
Butch walks into his modest kitchen, and opens the refrigerator. 
He takes out a carton of milk and drinks from it. 
With carton in hard, Butch surveys the apartment. Then he goes to the bedroom. 
His bedroom is like the rest of the apartment  neat, clean and anonymous. The only things personal in his room are a few boxing trophies, an Olympic silver medal, a framed issue of "Ring Magazine" with Butch on the cover, and a poster of Jerry Quarry and one of George Chuvalo. 
Sure enough, there's the watch just like he said it was: On the bedside table, hanging on his little kangaroo statue. 
He walks through the apartment and back into the kitchen. He opens a cupboard and takes out a box of Pop Tarts. Putting down the milk, he opens the box, takes out two Pop Tarts and puts them in the toaster. 
Butch glances to his right, his eyes fall on something. 
What he sees is a small compact Czech M61 submachine gun with a huge silencer on it, lying on his kitchen counter. 
BUTCH (softly) Holy shit. 
He picks up the intimidating peace of weaponry and examines it. 
Then... a toilet FLUSHES. 
Butch looks up to the bathroom door, which is parallel to the kitchen. There is someone behind it. 
Like a rabbit caught in a radish patch, Butch freezes, not knowing what to do. 
The bathroom door opens and Vincent Vega steps out of the bathroom, tightening his belt. In his hand is the book "MODESTY BLAISE" by Peter O'Donnell. 
Vincent and Butch lock eyes. 
Vincent freezes. 
Butch doesn't move, except to point the M61 in Vincent's direction. 
Neither man opens his mouth. 
Then... the toaster LOUDLY kicks up the Pop Tarts. 
That's all the situation needed. 
Butch's finger HITS the trigger. 
MUFFLED FIRE SHOOTS out of the end of the gun. 
Vincent is seemingly WRACKED with twenty bullets SIMULTANEOUSLY  LIFTING him off his feet, PROPELLING him through the air and CRASHING through the glass shower door at the end of the bathroom. 
By the time Butch removes his finger from the trigger, Vincent is annihilated. 
Butch stands frozen, amazed at what just happened. His look goes from the grease spot in the bathroom that was once Vincent, down to the powerful piece of artillery in his grip. 
With the respect it deserves, Butch carefully places the M61 back on the kitchen counter. 
Then he exits the apartment, quickly. 
EXT. APARTMENT COURTYARD  DAY 
Butch, not running, but walking very rapidly, crosses the courtyard... 
...comes out of the apartment building, crosses the street... 
...goes through the alley... 
...and into his car in one STEADICAM SHOT. 
EXT. HONDA  DAY 
Butch CRANKS the car into gear and drives away. The big wide smile of a survivor breaks across his face. 
EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING STREET  DAY 
The Honda turns down the alley and slowly cruises by his apartment building. 
INT. HONDA  DAY 
Butch looks out the window at his former home. 
BUTCH That's how you're gonna beat 'em, Butch.  They keep underestimatin' ya. 
This makes the boxer laugh out loud. As he laughs, he flips a tape in the cassette player. When the MUSIC starts, he SINGS along with it. 
He drives by the apartment, but is stopped at the light on the corner across from Teriyaki Donut. 
Butch is still chuckling, singing along with the song, as we see: 
THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD 
The big man himself, Marsellus Wallace, exit Teriyaki Donut, carrying a box of a dozen donuts and two large styrofoam cups of coffee. He steps off the curb, crossing the street in front of Butch's car. This is the first time we see Marsellus clearly. 
Laughing boy stops when he sees the big man directly in front of him. 
When Marsellus is in front of Butch's car, he casually glances to his left, sees Butch, continues walking... then STOPS!

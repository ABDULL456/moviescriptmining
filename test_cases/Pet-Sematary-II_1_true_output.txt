GEOFF MATTHEWS, Renee's 12 year-old son steps into view. Renee's face lights up when she sees him. 
RENEE How long have you been here? 
GEOFF Couple minutes. I saw the last shot. That was pretty cool. 
Renee grimaces as the make-up girl spritzes her face with a spray- bottle. 
RENEE (casually) How did it go with your father last night? 
GEOFF Good. He said he'd be over for dinner at eight... (awkward) I mean... he misses you, Mom... 
RENEE I miss him too... 
RENEE (continuing) I just don't want you to get your hopes up, okay? We're trying to work things out, but... 
Her voice trails off. 
GEOFF I know, Mom. 
RENEE (affectionate) You know everything, don't you? 
Renee and Geoff are interrupted by a CREWMEMBER who's spraying "atmosphere" about the set with a hand-held smoke machine. Renee coughs. 
Off-set, the FIRST A.D. is trying to get the show on the road. 
FIRST A.D. Okay, people! Quiet! We're going to try this another time! 
GEOFF Guess it's showtime. 
RENEE Yep. 
Renee kisses Geoff on the forehead. He takes the cigarette from her and moves off the set, standing near the camera. 
The director turns back toward Renee. 
DIRECTOR Alright, Renee. Last time. I promise. We nail this and you won't have to do this ever again. 
RENEE That's what you said the first time... 
Renee turns and heads back toward the stairs. A P.A. hands her a new lantern. As she reaches the stairs, the house lights dim, creating the proper atmosphere once again. 
UNDER THE SET - 
The puppeteer gets ready. It's cramped. The electrician checks a power box connection. 
The director nods to the camera operator. 
OPERATOR Rolling. Speed... 
SLATE BOY "Castle of Terror." Scene 69A. Take thirteen. 
The slate comes down. 
DIRECTOR Action! 
The scene replays itself as before, only now we're watching the action from multiple viewpoints. 
We start on the video assist monitor, then move up to... 
GEOFF 
He grins as he watches the scene unfold. 
ON THE SET 
Renee has reached the sarcophagus. LIGHTNING flashes. The skeleton hand bursts up, grabbing Renee's arm. The scene continues past the original point of interruption. 
UNDER THE SET - 
We see an undetected LEAK. Water drips down. The puppeteer shifts position, struggling, and... 
...knocks over the power box which SPARKS just as... 
ABOVE - 
Renee/Genvieve grabs the iron railing with both hands. 
Electricity surges through Renee. Her body jerks and writhes like some nightmarish marionette. 
UNDER THE SET - 
The electrician drags the puppeteer back. Sparks fly. 
ELECTRICIAN Jesus! We've crossed over into 220! Shut down the generator!

Behind, Emma opens her eyes.  As if revived by the kiss.  Or the ring.  Looks up at him. 
EMMA Steed? 
Steed looks back at her -- surprise, delight. 
STEED Mrs. Peel? 
EMMA What kept you? 
STEED The plot. (realizing) Hello, we must be going ... 
353     CLOSEUP - AUTO-DESTRUCT NUMBERS 
Racing backwards as ... 
354     SEVERAL ANGLES 
Steed pulls Emma through the catwalks and corridors of Valentine's Labyrinth ... 
355     MORE NUMBERS 
racing to zero, nothing to stop them ... 
356     INT.  TORTURE CHAMBER - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Steed and Emma race in -- she sees the sarcophagus. 
EMMA Quick! 
Emma scrambles in and Steed leaps on top of her, bringing down the lid as ... 
357     SEVERAL ANGLES 
3-2-1 -- and a BLAST like a nuclear EXPLOSION -- as the Underground HQ is fragmented to smithereens -- Emma's " coffin" goes flying ... as the SCREEN WHITES OUT. 
358     EXT.  ALBERT BRIDGE - NIGHT 
Beneath the clear moonlight, all bulbs on -- like Xmas. 
359     BELOW 
it floats the coffin -- which opens, revealing ... 
Steed and Emma, squashed together, gasping for breath. 
STEED 'The owl and the pussycat went to sea -' 
EMMA '... in a beautiful pea green boat...' 
STEED A fine night, Mrs. Peel ... 
EMMA Still a bit chilly ... 
STEED English weather. You know, after all we've been through, I should say we deserve a long holiday ... 
EMMA Have you any place in mind? 
STEED As a matter of fact I have ... 
The coffin drifts downstream in the moonlight. 
SLOW DISSOLVE TO: 
360     EXT.  SIBERIAN ICE FIELDS - DAY				360 
A few weeks later.  Across snowy wastes, a pack of Huskies drag a sled behind them, WHIP CRACKED by a -- 
Frozen fur-clad Siberian peasant.  As he turns a corner, dogs stumble from ice and snow into -- 
361     SAND 
The peasant stops, stares. 
362     AHEAD OF HIM 
Sun beats down.  A tropical beach.  A warm sea.  A butler, Trubshaw.  POPS a CHAMPAGNE CORK.  From a tent, he brings two glasses down the beach to 
363     TWO DIVAN-STYLE DECK CHAIRS 
Where Steed and Emma toast in the sun.  Steed in a smoking jacket, Emma in a bikini. 
EMMA I don't recall Siberia being this warm, Steed. 
STEED It's the latest thing, Mrs. Peel. 
EMMA Our little paradise -- just made for two? 
STEED (looks; frowns) Not quite. 
On cue from the water, Mother emerges, snorkeling in his wheelchair contraption -- with Brenda.  He waves to -- 
STEED Our chaperon. 
EMMA Pity your mother came, too ... 
Steed seems peeved that his chance to be alone with EMMA is spoiled.  Trubshaw pours glasses of champagne. 
STEED Still a little warm, Trubshaw. Is this the '28? A little more ice, I think ... 
Trubshaw trots off dutifully.  A large ice bucket appears.  Mother moves in.  Absorbed by Emma, now his new protegee. 
MOTHER About your next assignment, Mrs. Peel ...

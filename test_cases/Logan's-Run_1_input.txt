By this time, Logan and Jessica are no longer listening to Box...their arms are enveloping one another...with strong feelings. 
BOX'S VOICE Superb! 
242		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX 
As his metal hand begins to BUZZ...he brings it to the base of the huge column supporting the cavern. 
As he works furiously...at Incredible speed: 
243		LOGAN AND JESSICA 
...oblivious to Box...their feelings intensifying as they continue to hold one another. 
244-245	OUT 
246		CLOSE - ON BOX 
BOX (stepping back) Done...behold...! 
247		REVERSE ANGLE - LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Before they turn to view the sculpture they kiss long and passionately. 
Their mood is broken by: 
BOX'S VOICE Done...Done...Done... 
Logan and Jessica break. They turn and see: 
248		FULL ANGLE - THE ICE SCULPTURE 
Box has captured them perfectly...shimmering with life...filled with emotion. 
249		WIDE ANGLE - INCLUDING LOGAN, JESSICA AND BOX 
There are tears in Jessica's eyes as she reacts to the sculpture. 
JESSICA (squeezing Logan's hand) It's glorious 
Logan helps Jessica off the pedestal and they both start to dress. 
LOGAN All right. Now you keep your bargain. 
BOX (rapt by his work) Wait for the wind! Wait and hear the birds sing over you! 
LOGAN (only interested in getting out) We're ready. 
Box mumbles as he leads Logan and Jessica toward the rear of the Ice Cavern. 
250		INT. - ICE ROOM 
As Box enters followed by Logan and Jessica. 
This room has a fairly low ceiling and it is not too wide. 
It stretches back as far as the eye can see. 
The ice along the left wall is frosted...but the ice along the right wall is perfectly clear. 
And embedded in the ice along the perfectly clear right wall are: 
251		WIDE ANGLE - MEN AND WOMEN 
Standing in erect positions. 
At first it appears that they might be more of Box's perfect works of sculpture. 
But as Logan and Jessica examine them closely through the clear ice...it is soon apparent that they are real people...who have been frozen. 
252		CLOSE ON LOGAN AND JESSICA 
Horrified as they move slowly along the wall. 
253		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING THE MEN AND WOMEN FROZEN IN THE WALL 
We can see that each of them has a black crystal flower in the palm of their right hands. Logan walks to the end of this wall. Each frozen body has a number above it. The final body's number is 1056...That number which the voice in Sandman's headquarters revealed as the number of missing Runners. 
The CAMERA PANS Logan back to Box. 
254		ANOTHER ANGLE - INCLUDING BOX 
As Logan turns toward him. 
LOGAN (stupefied) How did they get in here?

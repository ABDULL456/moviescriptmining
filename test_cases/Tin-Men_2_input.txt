38   INT. TILLEY'S HOUSE - BATHROOM - NIGHT                         38 Tilley is in the tub, lathering himself.   Nora enters and sits on the side of the tub. NORA You know, Tilley, we hardly ever do things together. TILLEY Like what? NORA Do things together that are enjoyable. TILLEY What would we do together for it to be enjoyable? NORA If we went on a picnic... it would be fun. (CONTINUED) 
38   CONTINUED:                                             38 TILLEY I don't understand a picnic... we just go some place... we put a thing on the ground, and we eat. NORA Yes... it's nice to do that. TILLEY Why? I don't get it. It's better sitting at home and watching TV. NORA I think there's something nice about a picnic... it's fun. TILLEY What's fun about it? Ants get into the food... there's bees. I don't get it. We have to drive, it takes maybe an hour to get there, then you sit in grass and eat. Why is that fun? NORA I just thought it might be nice to do something together, that's all... thought it might be fun. TILLEY It doesn't sound like fun to me... you take the stuff you've got here in the house, you take it someplace to eat it. It's just as much fun eating in front of the TV, and we do that together, don't we? No ants and no bees... much more comfortable. NORA It's not the same thing. TILLEY Scrub my back, will ya, Nora. Nora picks up the back brush, puts soap on it and starts scrubbing Tilley's back. (CONTINUED) 
38   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              38 TILLEY Not too hard! (beat) Don't get me wrong, I'm willing to do anything with you. I'm just a little stymied by a picnic. If you want to go, send me a postcard. Nora drops the brush in the tub and walks out of the bathroom. TILLEY What did I say?

39   EXT. INDUSTRIAL PARK - DAY                                    39 We see Tilley's Cadillac cruising the streets, obviously looking for someone. CUT TO: 
40   INT. TILLEY'S CADILLAC - DAY                                  40 Tilley is driving with Gil in the passenger seat. GIL I think you make a left here. Tilley turns the car. GIL Yeah... there it is... that's the place... Superior Aluminum... that's it over there. As Tilley pulls up we see BB's car parked outside of the building. TILLEY Okay, Mr. Marengay... here I come. He reaches into the backseat of the car and takes out a crowbar. GIL Hey, Tilley, don't go too wild... (CONTINUED) 
40   CONTINUED:                                             40 TILLEY I'll show the son of a bitch. He gets out of the car, crosses to BB's Cadillac, and smashes in the windshield and all of the windows of the car. TILLEY (as he smashes, wildly) He'll get a lot of air... won't be too stuffy in this car when I'm finished. GIL (calling from Tilley's Cadillac) Quick, Tilley... let's get out of here. Tilley runs back to his car and drives away. CUT TO: 
41   INT. SUPERIOR ALUMINUM SIDING OFFICE - TIGHT SHOT - DAY      41 Of a map of a 15 block area of Baltimore. Colored pins are in place indicating various homes that have been provided with aluminum siding. Another pin goes into place. BAGEL (O.S.) That was a good sale, Double B. Just got a call on a loan... we're in business. 
CUT TO: 
ANOTHER ANGLE We see BAGEL. He's a little guy with a black Fedora and baggy pants held up with suspenders. BB stands with him. BAGEL This whole section has been very fertile for us. CUT TO: (CONTINUED) 
41   CONTINUED:                                              41 ANOTHER ANGLE Moe, Looney and Carly are talking to STANLEY FRANKS, a young guy in his early 20's. He is dressed in the "Ivy League" look of the times. MOE (to Stanley) Sure you wanna get into the tin game? STANLEY Money's good, I understand. LOONEY Lot of crazy people you're gonna run into when you're knocking on those doors. Hermits that don't see the outside world, Jehovah's Witnesses that try and sell you the Bible at the same time you're trying to sell them tin. People that are just lonely and want to have conversations. CARLY Every time you step in that door, you've got to be fast on your feet. STANLEY Interesting. MOE (quizzing Stanley) What's the best way to qualify a mark?

FIONA Excuse me. Could we just skip ahead to the "I do's"? 
FARQUAAD (chuckles and then motions to the priest to indulge Fiona) Go on. 
COURTYARD 
Some guards are milling around. Suddenly the dragon lands with a boom. The guards all take off running. 
DONKEY (to Dragon) Go ahead, HAVE SOME FUN. If we need you, I'll whistle. How about that? (she nods and goes after the guards) Shrek, wait, wait! Wait a minute! You wanna do this right, don't you? 
SHREK (at the Church door) What are you talking about? 
DONKEY There's a line you gotta wait for. The preacher's gonna say, "Speak now or forever hold your peace." That's when you say, "I object!" 
SHREK I don't have time for this! 
DONKEY Hey, wait. What are you doing? Listen to me! Look, you love this woman, don't you? 
SHREK Yes. 
DONKEY You wanna hold her? 
SHREK Yes. 
DONKEY Please her? 
SHREK Yes! 
DONKEY (singing James Brown style) Then you got to, got to try a little tenderness. (normal) The chicks love that romantic crap! 
SHREK All right! Cut it out. When does this guy say the line? 
DONKEY We gotta check it out. 
INSIDE CHURCH 
As the priest talks we see Donkey's shadow through one of the windows Shrek tosses him up so he can see. 
PRIEST And so, by the power vested in me... 
Outside 
SHREK What do you see?

LOU (with genuine emotion) We're in 1971. 
ADAM 
(CORRECTING HIM) We're in 1987. Everyone looks stunned and dazed. 
JACOB What are we gonna do? I have plans next weekend. 
ADAM We all have plans. It's my fucking wedding! 
NICK Now hold on, we don't know for sure that we're in 1987. The TV shows a (real) COMMERCIAL for the COMMODORE 64 computer, with a JINGLE that SINGS: "Are you keeping up with the Commodore, 'cause the Commodore's keeping up with you..." 
When it's over... 
NICK (CONT'D) OK, we're in 1987. Adam stands up, completely losing it. 
ADAM What the FUCK is going on?! Nick stands up and calmly takes charge. 
NICK Everyone relax. I think I know what's happened. And when we're done discussing it, we're all gonna feel a lot better. Everyone looks to Nick, who seems to have the answer. 
NICK (CONT'D) Two words: black hole. He lets it hang in the air for a moment, as if it's suddenly going to gel for everyone. But the guys look confused. 
NICK (CONT'D) I saw a special on the Science Channel. And guess what? Sometimes this happens. 
ADAM This happens? 
NICK Yes. And the best thing for us to do is to stay put. The universe will eventually reverse itself and work out this little glitch. Nick sits down, looking satisfied in his know-it-all-ness. 
ADAM This is a big glitch. 
JACOB Yeah, you're an idiot. Black holes are in space. Not at a ski resort. 
LOU 
(HOPEFUL) So does this mean we get to go to girls' locker rooms and see them naked and they can't see us? 
JACOB No, we traveled through time. We're not invisible. Lou looks upset. 
LOU (under his breath) I'm still gonna do it. 
ADAM Guys, ignoring the ridiculousness of how we got here for a moment-- 
NICK Black hole. 
ADAM How are we supposed to get back? For a moment, everyone sits and absorbs the question. Then: 
LOU We find a scientist. 
CUT TO: 
INT. IBM / RECEPTION - LATE AFTERNOON 
Our guys WAIT NERVOUSLY near a RECEPTION DESK, above which is the "IBM" logo. Lou reads a MAGAZINE. 
LOU This Dukakis guy seems like he might be the real deal. An affable MAN IN A SUIT approaches. 
MAN IN SUIT Gentlemen, how may I help you? 
NICK We're waiting for a scientist. 
MAN IN SUIT I am a scientist. 
LOU Where's your white coat? 
SCIENTIST I'm not that kind of scientist.

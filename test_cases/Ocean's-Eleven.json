DANNY OCEAN, dressed in prison fatigues, ENTERS FRAME and sits. \nVOICE (O.S.) Good morning. \nDANNY Good morning. \nVOICE (O.S.) Please state your name for the record. \nDANNY Daniel Ocean. \nVOICE (O.S.) Thank you. Mr. Ocean, the purpose of this meeting is to determine whether, if released, you are likely to break the law again. While this was your first conviction, you have been implicated, though never charged, in over a dozen other confidence schemes and frauds. What can you tell us about this? \nDANNY As you say, ma'am, I was never charged. \n2   INT. PAROLE BOARD HEARING ROOM - WIDER VIEW - MORNING         2 \nThree PAROLE BOARD MEMBERS sit opposite Danny, behind a table. \nBOARD MEMBER #2 Mr. Ocean, what we're trying to find out is: was there a reason you chose to commit this crime, or was there a reason why you simply got caught this time? \nDANNY My wife left me. I was upset.    I got into a self-destructive pattern. \n(CONTINUED) \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                                 2. \n2   CONTINUED:                                                     2 \nBOARD MEMBER #3 If released, is it likely you would fall back into a similar pattern? \nDANNY She already left me once. I don't think she'll do it again just for kicks. \nGlances dart between the Board Members. \nBOARD MEMBER #1 Mr. Ocean, what do you think you would do if released? \nDanny considers. \nDANNY (deadpan) I don't know. How much do you guys make a year? \n3   INT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - CHECK-OUT STATION - DAY         3 \nGUARD #2 Ocean, Daniel. \nDanny steps forth, and GUARD #1 doles out his possessions and a form certifying their return to Danny. \nGUARD #2 Sign. (adding a piece of mail to the pile) This came today for you. Rest'll be forwarded to your parole officer. \nGUARD #1 (reading its return address over Danny's shoulder) Those your lawyers? \nDANNY My wife's. \nHe opens the letter, and as his eyes gaze over the papers within, he smirks just a little. \nGUARD #1 What's it say? \n(CONTINUED) \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                                 3. \n3    CONTINUED:                                                    3 \nDANNY I'm a free man. \n4    INT. CHANGING CUBICLE                                         4 \nDanny pulls on civilian clothes and there's not a bare thread among them. He tugs his cuffs and smiles: The old skin feels good. One last item to don: a silver wedding band. Danny considers it. Will he put it on? \n5    EXT. MINIMUM-SECURITY PRISON - FRONT GATE - AFTERNOON         5 \nA sign reads: \"NEW JERSEY STATE MINIMUM-SECURITY CORRECTIONAL FACILITY.\" Someone has graffitied below it: \"If you were in prison, you'd be home now.\" \nThe great metal door opens, and Danny stands within its frame, ready for release. (If it matters -- and if you notice -- he's wearing his wedding ring.) \nHe hovers   there for a moment, on the precipice of freedom.    The WIND WHISTLES a little on the other side of the gate,   and the view ahead is not pleasant (New Jersey):    Life is hard out there. \nBut Danny musters his courage, then takes his first step into free America... \nA6   EXT. ATLANTIC CITY BOARDWALK - DUSK                           A6 \nAny empty wintery boardwalk. \n6    INT. CASINO (ATLANTIC CITY) - NIGHT                           6 \n... And his wingtip lands squarely on plush red carpeting. \nAs we PULL UP TO Danny's face and SPIN AROUND him, we hear, then see the BUZZ of a CASINO floor: the HUM of CONVERSATION, the DING-DING-DING and THUNK-THUNK-THUNK from the SLOTS, the brisk WHIR of SHUFFLED CARDS. \nAnd to Danny, it's a hearth and fire and a comfy chair and a snifter of brandy. He's home. \nON DANNY'S WALLET \nAs he pulls out several crisp one hundreds, sets them on green felt, then sees them replaced by a neat pile of chips. \n7   AT BLACKJACK TABLE                                            7 \nDanny cranes his neck about the casino, looking for someone -- a friend, somebody who should be here -- but without success. He turns his attention back to his cards, and the cards of the dealer. \nNine-ten. Stay. Dealer -- seventeen. Danny wins. King-four. Dealer shows a six. Stick. Dealer busts. Queen-ace. Twenty-one. Danny wins again. \nA second dealer relieves the first, and Danny recognizes him with a smile -- this wasn't the friend he was scouting for, but two hours out of the joint any familiar face is welcome. \nDANNY Hello, Frank. \nA12   INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT                               A12 \n-- where they must weave through hordes of young Hollywood nightclubbers. \nRUSTY Alright.   Who's here? \nTOPHER Josh is here. Seth is here. David couldn't make it. He's got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania because somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany. \nRUSTY That's a problem. \nTOPHER Barry is here. \nRUSTY I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver. \nTOPHER Couldn't work the dates. Oh, and he brought his girlfriend. \n(CONTINUED) \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01                                 9. \nA12   CONTINUED:                                                      A12 \nRUSTY Not the one from -- \nTOPHER Uh-huh. \nRUSTY (beat) I quit watching when Kate left Don after his accident. \nThey pass on, and into -- \n12    OMITTED                                                         12 \nA13   INT. BACK ROOM - NIGHT                                          A13 \nSmall but stylish.     Rusty enters, Topher in tow. \nRUSTY Good evening, guys. Let's play some cards... \nA glance at the table reveals: the three waiting players are all young TV stars (Josh Jackson, Seth Green, Barry Watson) here for a group poker lesson with Rusty. (One star, indeed, has brought his girlfriend, Katie, also a known actress, to observe.) \nA glance back at Rusty reveals:     he's in for a long night. \nRUSTY ... and let's play some cards. \nAT TABLE - LATER \nThe group lesson has begun. \nTOPHER A hundred bucks to me... (mulling it over) Ah, what the hell. Pocket change. Call. \nRusty leans into Topher's ear, whispering: \n(CONTINUED) \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01                                 10. \nA13   CONTINUED:                                                      A13 \nRUSTY Why you bet a certain way is your business. But you have to make them think you're betting for a reason. Understand? \nSAME SCENE - LATER \nTo another player: \nRUSTY Seth. You know what you have. Looking at them doesn't change them. Leave 'em where they are and make your bet. \nSAME SCENE - LATER \nTo another player: \nRUSTY You're showing. Yeah, I know she's your girlfriend, Barry, but you can't... Thank you. \nSAME SCENE - LATER \nTo another: \nRUSTY Josh.   Deal to your left. \nSAME SCENE - LATER \nA WAITRESS enters from the club, and DANCE MUSIC with her. As she distributes a fresh round: \nWAITRESS One McCallum neat. And four bottled waters. \nRusty takes in the sight -- bottled fucking water on a poker table. \nSETH (triumphantly) Two pair -- nines and twos. \nRusty checks his hand:     a full-house full of face cards. \n(CONTINUED) \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01                                 11. \nA13   CONTINUED:    (2)                                               A13 \nRUSTY (folding) You got me. (as Seth rakes in his winnings) Let's take a little break. \n13    OMITTED                                                         13 \nA14   INT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT                              A14 \nAt the bar, Rusty orders a double.     He needs it. \nBARTENDER (shouting over music) How's the game going?!! \nRUSTY It's been the longest hour of my life. \nBARTENDER What?! \nRUSTY (at the same volume) I'm running away with your wife. \nThe Bartender, not able to hear him, smiles and flashes a thumbs-up before moving away. \nBARTENDER Cool, man! \nBehind the bar two go-go dancers writhe behind red-light- district windows, and Rusty catches his own fatigued expression in their reflection. Then, out the corner of his eye, he catches sight of a man passing through the pulsating crowd. Someone familiar to him. He follows. \n14    OMITTED                                                         14 \nA15   INT.

Sorry, guys. I -- I was sure he was bluffing. \nAs Rusty plummets in the estimation of all the guys around him, Danny rakes in his pot. \nDANNY Thanks for the game, fellas. (then) Hey, I hate to ask this, but could you sign something for me? It's for the guys in the joint. They just love all your shows. \n15    OMITTED                                                          15 \nA16   EXT. HOLLYWOOD CLUB (DEEP) - NIGHT                               A16 \nA queue of clubgoers erupt in a frenzy as Topher and company exit, and they begin signing autographs. Danny and Rusty exit, too, but of course nobody gives a shit about them. \n16    INT. RUSTY'S FALCON - MOVING - NIGHT                             16 \nDanny and Rusty ride silently, staring out opposite windows at Sunset Boulevard. \nRUSTY That was, that was just... \nDANNY Unprofessional. \nRusty agrees. \nRUSTY How was the clink? You get the cookies I sent you? \nDANNY Why do you think I came to see you first? \nDanny pulls out a wad of bills from his jacket, peels off half, and hands it to Rusty. \nDANNY Ten grand.   Half of it's yours. \n(CONTINUED) \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 5/31/01                                  12E. \n16   CONTINUED:                                                        16 \nRUSTY You barge into my new workplace, ruin my professional reputation, least you could do is tell me you've got something better for me. \nDANNY I've got something better for you. \n17   INT. CANTER'S DELI - NIGHT                                        17 \nThey're sitting in a booth over coffee. \nRUSTY How's Tess? \nDanny stares at him:       next subject, please. \nRUSTY Alright.   Tell me. \nDANNY It's tricky. No one's ever done it before. Needs planning, a large crew. \nRUSTY Guns? \nDANNY Not loaded ones. It has to be very precise. There's a lot of security. But the take... \nRUSTY What's the target? \nDANNY Eight figures each. \nRUSTY What's.    The.    Target. \n(CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED:                                                     17 \nDANNY (deep breath, then) When's the last time you were in Vegas? \nRUSTY What? You wanna knock over a casino? \nDanny puts down his coffee. And shakes his head. And lifts three fingers: three casinos. Rusty must put down his coffee, too. \n18   EXT. DOWNTOWN L.A. - NIGHT                                     18 \nIt's after hours downtown.    Dark, empty, dead... \n19   INT. LIBRARY TOWER - 40TH FLOOR CORRIDOR - NIGHT               19 \nLights out on the 40th. Engraved brass announces:     J.A. KUEHN & ASSOCIATES, ARCHITECTS. \nTwo flashlight beams strafe wood-paneled, elegant offices: Danny and Rusty on late-night reconnaissance. As Danny prowls a cabinet full of blueprints, Rusty passes the time switching papers from a desk's in box to its out box. \nAt last, Danny finds the right set of blueprints and drapes it across the desk; we, however, never see it. \nDANNY The vault at the Bellagio. \nA beat as Rusty scans the document, then another underneath it. \nRUSTY If I'm reading these right -- and I think that I am -- this is probably the least accessible vault ever designed. (beat) Oops. Actually, you know what, I'm wrong. It's definitely the least accessible vault ever designed. \nDANNY Yep. \nRusty's brow furrows just a little. \n(CONTINUED) \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                                    14. \n19   CONTINUED:                                                        19 \nRUSTY You said three casinos... \nDANNY (flips to next blueprint) These feed into the cages at both the Mirage and the M.G.M. Grand. (tapping vault) But every dime ends up here. \nRUSTY The Bellagio, Mirage, and... These are Terry Benedict's places. \nDANNY Yes, they are.     Think he'll mind? \nRUSTY More than somewhat. \n20   AT 40TH FLOOR ELEVATOR BAY                                        20 \nNo ding. The elevator just arrives. Its doors part to reveal a SECURITY GUARD within, here to make his tour; a large fellow, he has to duck to exit. \n21   BACK WITH DANNY AND RUSTY                                         21 \nAs Danny rolls up the set of blueprints, Rusty considers the plan (which, in our absence, Danny has pitched him). \nRUSTY You'd need at least a dozen guys, doing a combination of cons. \nDANNY Like what, you think? \nRUSTY Well, off the top of my head, I'd say you're looking at a Boesky, a Jim Brown, a Miss Daisy, two Jethros, and a Leon Spinks. Oh, and the biggest Ella Fitzgerald ever. (beat) Where do you think you're gonna get the money to back this? \n(CONTINUED) \nTISHKOFF But what am I saying? You guys are pros, the best. I'm sure you can make it out of the casino. Of course, lest we forget, once you're out the front door, you're still in the middle of the fucking desert! \nBoth Danny and Rusty look chastened. \nRUSTY You're right. (to Danny) He's right. \nDANNY Reuben, you're right. Our eyes are bigger than our stomachs. \nRUSTY That's exactly it. Pure ego. \nTISHKOFF Yeah yeah blah blah. \nDANNY Thank you so much for setting us straight. Sorry we bothered you. \nThey both rise to go. \nTISHKOFF Look, we all go way back. I owe you from that thing with the guy in the place, and I'll never forget it. \nDANNY It was our pleasure. \nRUSTY I'd never been to Belize. \n(CONTINUED) \n30   CONTINUED:                                                      30 \nTISHKOFF Give Dominic your addresses, I got some remaindered furniture I wanna send you. \nDanny and Rusty begin to circle the pool to leave. Tishkoff, of course, won't let them go that easily. \nTISHKOFF Just out of curiosity, which casinos did you geniuses pick to rob? \nDanny stops, almost as if he's been waiting for this question, which of course he has. \nDANNY The Bellagio, Mirage, and the M.G.M. Grand. \nTISHKOFF (nostrils flared, smelling a rat) Those are Terry Benedict's casinos. \nRUSTY Say, you know, he's right. \nTishkoff waves them back, sipping on his umbrellaed cocktail. \nTISHKOFF You guys... Whadda you got against Terry Benedict? \nDANNY What do you have against him? That's the real question. \nTISHKOFF He torpedoed my casino, muscled me out, now he's gonna blow it up next month to make way for another fuckin' eyesore. Don't think I don't see what you're doin'. \nRUSTY What are we doing, Reuben? \n(CONTINUED) \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                                 21. \n30   CONTINUED:    (2)                                              30 \nTISHKOFF You gonna steal from Terry Benedict, you better goddamn know. This sorta thing used to be civilized. You'd hit a guy, he'd whack you. Done. But Benedict... (bristles) At the end of this he better not know you're involved, not know your names, or think you're dead. Because he'll kill you, and then he'll go to work on you. \nDANNY That's why we've got to be very careful. We have to be precise. We have to be well-funded. \nTISHKOFF Yeah, you gotta be nuts, too. And you're gonna need a crew as nuts as you are. (pregnant silence) Who do you have in mind? \nDanny and Rusty both smile; they've hooked their fish. And so it begins... \nRUSTY (V.O.) Alright.   Who's in? \nDANNY (V.O.) Frank C. is in. \n31   INT. CASINO OFFICE (ATLANTIC CITY)                             31 \nFrank Catton coughs mightily into a handkerchief.   Across a desk, his boss fills out paperwork. \nDANNY (V.O.) Frank C. has developed a bad case of bronchitis and is putting in for a transfer to warmer climates. \n32   EXT. LAS VEGAS AIRPORT - DAY                                   32 \nFrank carries his bag toward the taxi bay. He stops to light a cigarette, inhales with deep satisfaction before a banner: \"WELCOME TO LAS VEGAS.\" \nDANNY (V.O.) What about drivers? \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                               22. \n33   EXT. VACANT, WEEDY DRAG RACETRACK - DAY                      33 \nCLOSE ON a souped-up tractor-wheeled monster truck, its ENGINE ROARING before a starting line, itching to cross it. Now take a step back... \nThat souped-up monster truck stands a foot-and-a-half off the ground and sprouts an antenna from its back bumper. It's a remote-controlled toy. \nThe ROARING ENGINE comes from the vehicle next to it: an actual monster truck. Both vehicles peer down the track at a finish line a hundred yards away. This is a race. \nThe drivers stare each other down: TURK (behind the wheel of the truck) and VIRGIL (track-side, remote control in hand) MALLOY. They're nice boys. Really. Peckerwoods, sure, but nice. \nRUSTY (V.O.) I talked to the Malloys yesterday. \nDANNY (V.O.) The Mormon twins? \nRUSTY (V.O.) They're both in Salt Lake City, six months off the job. I got the sense they're having trouble filling the hours. \nLights flash red-to-yellow-to-green and while the TRUCK COATS RUBBER on the track, Virgil's toy zips to a lead. It's looking to be an embarrassment for Turk until he jerks his wheel a little and -- ka-thunk -- flattens his brother's vehicle. \nVirgil pouts as he plucks up the wreckage of his entry. \nDANNY (V.O.) Electronics? \nRUSTY (V.O.) Livingston Dell. \n34   INT. SURVEILLANCE VAN - DAY                                  34 \nOn a black and white monitor: Two mobsters, on a meet in a public park, peer over their shoulders, making certain no one is watching them. Little do they know... \n... LIVINGSTON DELL, audio-visual junkie, and victim of a continual flop sweat, crouches before their image, masterfully controlling his surveillance camera with a joystick in his left hand. He is flanked by FBI MEN. \n(CONTINUED) \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 1/8/01                                    23. \n34   CONTINUED:                                                        34 \nRUSTY (V.O.) Livingston's been doing freelance surveillance work of late for the F.B.I. Mob Squad. \nDANNY (V.O.) How are his nerves? \nRUSTY (V.O.) Okay. (beat) Not so bad you'd notice. \nAs a FBI Man reaches to adjust a monitor... \nLIVINGSTON D-don't, don't-don't... touch... it. \nFBI MAN #1 What? \nANNOUNCER (V.O.) (in Chinese, then English) Ladies and gentlemen: the amazing Yen. \nA funambulist (YEN) begins his high-wire act... \nDANNY So he can walk on a rope. \nRUSTY More than that. \nDANNY So he can juggle. We need a grease man, not an acrobat. Who else is on the list? \nRUSTY He is the list. \n(CONTINUED) \nOCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00                             28. \n42   CONTINUED:                                                   42 \nDANNY Who else? \nRUSTY Watch. \nHalfway across the wire, the funambulist sits. And very slowly, but without hesitation, he contorts himself into a ball, never losing his balance. Even Danny is impressed. \nRUSTY There's your grease man. \n43   EXT. SANTA MONICA PIER PARKING LOT - DAY                     43 \nDanny and Rusty exit the circus tent, head for their car. \nDANNY We need Saul. \nRUSTY He won't come. He swore off the game a year ago. \nDANNY He get religion? \nRUSTY Ulcers. \nDANNY You can ask him. \nRusty stops, stares at Danny, sighs. \n(CONTINUED) \n43   CONTINUED:                                                      43 \nRUSTY I can ask. \n44   EXT. DOG TRACK/BETTING WINDOW (MIAMI, FLA) - DAY                44 \nSAUL BLOOM, 50s, befuddled, wearing a corduroy jacket patched at the elbows and a duffer's hat, counts out money through the window, lists his bets. He checks his tickets, plunges them into his pants pocket, and moves off... \n45   THROUGH TRACK LOBBY                                             45 \nRusty appears in the f.g. behind a pillar, as dapper as Saul is down-at-heel, watching him go. When Saul disappears into the tunnel, he moves. \n46   IN INFIELD                                                      46 \nSaul sits on one of the long, general admission steps under the box seats. He produces an orange from his pocket, starts to peel it. A pair of well-shined shoes appears behind him. Saul senses their presence, but doesn't turn around. \nSAUL I saw you in the paddock before the second race, outside the men's room, when I placed my bet. I saw you before you even got up this morning. \nRUSTY How ya been, Saul? \nSAUL Never better. \nRUSTY What's with the orange? \nSAUL My doctor says I need vitamins. \nRUSTY So why don't you take vitamins? \nFor the first time, Saul cranes his neck and shoots a look up at Rusty. \n(CONTINUED) \n46   CONTINUED:                                                     46 \nSAUL You come here to give me a physical? \nRUSTY I got a box seat.

From this point on Saul's eyes never leave the race. \nSAUL You gonna ask me? Or should I just say no and get it over with? \nRUSTY Saul, you're the best there is. You're in Cooperstown. What do you want? \nSAUL Nothin'. I got a duplex now, I got wall-to-wall and a goldfish, I'm seeing a nice lady, she works the unmentionables counter at Macy's. I've changed. \nRUSTY Guys like us don't change, Saul. We stay sharp or we get sloppy, but we don't change. \nSAUL Quit connin' me. \n(CONTINUED) \n47   CONTINUED:                                                    47 \nThey watch the race. \nRUSTY That your hound way in the back there? \nSAUL He breaks late. Everyone knows this. \nOn the track: The dogs are now coming around the back stretch, and the crowd on the bleachers rises, cheering. \nSAUL You gonna treat me like a grownup at least? Tell me what the scam is? \nUnder the noise: Rusty leans in and whispers in Saul's ear. Saul's eyes widen, then glaze over as all around him people are standing and shouting. \nRusty places an envelope in Saul's lap, then gets up and walks out as, on the track, the #4 dog crosses the finish line... last by several lengths. \nSaul considers his options. In one hand: a fan of losing tickets. In the other (courtesy of Rusty): a ticket to Las Vegas. \nDANNY (V.O.) And Saul makes ten. \n48   INT.

Before we start, nobody's on the line here yet. What I'm about to propose to you happens to be both highly lucrative and highly dangerous. If that doesn't sound like your particular brand of vodka, help yourself to as much food as you like and safe journey. No hard feelings.

Revealed beneath is a complex substructure, featuring three tunnels, each leading from a casino to a single freight-sized elevator shaft which descends into an enormous vault. \nDANNY Gentlemen: the Bellagio vault. Located below the Strip, beneath two hundred feet of solid earth. It safeguards every dime that comes through each of the three casinos above it. (beat) And we're going to rob it. \nEveryone takes a breath, awed. \nLINUS Smash-and-grab job, huh? \nRUSTY It's a little more complicated than that. \nDanny picks up a remote control and flips on a panel of Tvs. \nDANNY Courtesy of Frank Catton, new blackjack dealer at the Bellagio, security tapes from the three casinos. \nOn the monitors: three montages of black-and-white security tapes, starting within the three casinos' cages, moving into the tunnels, then (as the TVs unite in their images) pushing into the elevator and eventually the vault. \nAs the group's glances shoot back and forth from the TV to the corresponding section of the model, i.e. from a POV of the tunnel to the miniature tunnel itself... \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED:    (2)                                                 58 \nDANNY Okay.    Bad news first. This place houses   a security system which rivals   most nuclear missile silos. First:    we have to get within the casino   cages -- \nRUSTY (indicating) -- here, here, and here -- \nDANNY -- which anyone knows takes more than a smile. Next: through these doors, each of which requires a different six-digit code changed every twelve hours. Past those lies the elevator, and this is where it gets tricky: the elevator won't move without authorized fingerprint identifications -- \nRUSTY -- which we can't fake -- \nDANNY -- and vocal confirmations from both the security center within the Bellagio and the vault below - - \nRUSTY -- which we won't get. \nDANNY Furthermore, the elevator shaft is rigged with motion detectors -- \nRUSTY -- meaning if we manually override the lift, the shaft's exit will lock down automatically and we'll be trapped. \nDANNY Once we've gotten down the shaft, though, then it's a walk in the park: just three more guards with Uzis and predilections toward not being robbed, and the most elaborate vault door conceived by man.

Wishes to speak with you privately. \nBENEDICT Who is he? \nPIT BOSS Businessman of some kind, working mostly in Europe. He's very vague, but I asked around. Word is he deals primarily in arms. One of the biggest. \nBENEDICT Zerga?    Never heard of him. \nPIT BOSS Yessir.    That's why I don't doubt it. \nBENEDICT He's staying here? \nPIT BOSS Checked in two nights ago, sir. He's in the Mirador suite. \nBENEDICT How's he doing? \nPIT BOSS Up.   Almost forty grand. \nBENEDICT (knowing he can't duck this) Good for him... \n107   INT.

You're the king of Vegas and you have to play craps in the alley. \nBENEDICT No shame at all. Reminds me of my youth. \nCORNER - MOMENT LATER \nBenedict and Saul are huddled in a corner. \nSAUL The fight is Saturday, is it not? \nBENEDICT Yes.   I can get you seats... \nSAUL No, no. Hand-to-hand combat doesn't interest me. I have a package arriving here Saturday evening. A black briefcase, standard size, the contents of which are very valuable to me. \nBENEDICT I'd be happy to put it in the house safe for you. \nSAUL The house safe is for brandy and grandmother's pearls.

A pinch is the equivalent of a cardiac arrest for any broad-band electrical circuitry. Or better yet: A pinch is a bomb... but without the bomb. Every time a nuclear weapon detonates, it unleashes an electromagnetic pulse which shuts down any power source within its vicinity. That tends not to matter in most cases because the nuclear weapon destroys everything you might need power for anyway. Now a pinch creates a similar electromagnetic pulse, but without the headache of mass destruction and death. So instead of Hiroshima, you get the Seventeenth Century. \nA121   INT.

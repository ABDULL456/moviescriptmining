Who's here? \nTOPHER Josh is here. Seth is here. David couldn't make it. He's got two weeks of reshoots on Lusitania because somebody just figured out forty percent of the budget is coming from Germany. \nRUSTY That's a problem. \nTOPHER Barry is here. \nRUSTY I thought they let him out to do that H.B.O. thing in Vancouver. \nTOPHER Couldn't work the dates.

Let's play some cards... \nA glance at the table reveals: the three waiting players are all young TV stars (Josh Jackson, Seth Green, Barry Watson) here for a group poker lesson with Rusty. (One star, indeed, has brought his girlfriend, Katie, also a known actress, to observe.) \nA glance back at Rusty reveals:     he's in for a long night. \nRUSTY ... and let's play some cards. \nAT TABLE - LATER \nThe group lesson has begun. \nTOPHER A hundred bucks to me...

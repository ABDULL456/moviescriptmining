MARTHA We all need to leave. 
LUCY What? 
MARTHA He's a fucking liar. We all need to leave. 
She points to the bartender. 
LUCY What are you talking about?

LUCY Breath. 
MARTHA Don't touch me, you're not listening to me! 
LUCY Martha please try to breath. I don't know what you're talking about. 
Ted walks into the bathroom and gets pills. He forces them down and makes Martha drink water. 
She calms down. She falls back onto the bed. 
Ted and Lucy look exhausted.

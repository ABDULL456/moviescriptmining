{"train": "THE ADDAMS FAMILY \nby \nLarry Wilson and Caroline Thompson \nRewrite by \nPaul Rudnick \nbased on the characters of Charles Addams \nSHOOTING SCRIPT \nApril 11, 1991 \nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/6/90 \nFADE IN: \nA1   EXT. ADDAMS MANSION FRONT STEPS - CHRISTMAS EVE            A1 \nA GROUP OF CAROLERS, their eager faces upturned, SINGS an endless and cloying roundelay of \"Little Drummer Boy.\" They sing with self-righteous good cheer. As they pompously begin their umpteenth verse, THE CAMERA SLOWLY PANS UP THE ADDAMS MANSION -- past the black wreath on the front door, past broken windows, weather-beaten shingles, a creaking shutter. \nTHE CAMERA CONTINUES TO PAN TO THE ROOF \nwhere the Addams Family members, GOMEZ, MORTICIA, GRANNY, PUGSLEY, WEDNESDAY, and LURCH, their faithful butler, gleefully POUR a CAULDRON OF BUBBLING, STEAMING PITCH over the edge. \nAS THE CAULDRON TIPS, THE CAMERA PUSHES INSIDE, THE \nBLACKNESS OF THE PITCH FILLS THE SCREEN. TITLES BEGIN. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n1    INT. DIM HALLWAY - SEVEN O'CLOCK A.M.                      1 \nC.U. AN OVER-SIZED \"CUCKOO\" CLOCK -- \nThe clock is a perfect REPLICA OF THE ADDAMS FAMILY HOUSE, down to the creaking shutter. It chimes the hour. In ONE WINDOW, a LITTLE MECHANICAL GOMEZ bends a MECHANICAL MORTICIA back until she's almost off her feet and plants a kiss between her clockwork decolletage. One, two, three mechanical kisses, counting toward seven o'clock. \nIN ANOTHER WINDOW, A MECHANICAL PUGSLEY hangs a MECHANICAL WEDNESDAY from a noose on a gallows, up and down. Meanwhile, little BURSTS OF FOG float off the rooftop where a little MECHANICAL GRANNY cranks her fog machine. The front door of the house pops open, and a MECHANICAL LURCH appears and begins sweeping. Just then, THING, the disembodied hand with the full-bodied personality, CLIMBS into view over the back of the clock. Thing leaps to the floor and SCAMPERS down the hall. \nLOW TRACKING SHOT \nfollows Thing along the hallway. \n(CONTINUED) \n3    INT. PUGSLEY'S ROOM - SAME TIME                             3 \nPugsley crouches on the floor, playing with his kid-sized chemistry set. The walls of his room are covered with road signs he's collected -- \"Bridge Out!\", \"Detour! Excavation Ahead!\", \"Dangerous Undertow!\", \"Keep Clear! High Voltage!\" SAWED-OFF STOP SIGNS, still on their poles, are stacked in the corner. \nIn another corner stands a CYLINDRICAL FLOOR-TO-CEILING \nFISH TANK, FILLED WITH PIRANHA. \nThis tubby energetic monster of a nine-year-old boy has every chance of growing up to be the public monster his parents would be proud of. He MIXES chemicals in a beaker. The brew steams.    Grin- ning wickedly, Pugsley SWALLOWS it down. He contorts, undergoing the beginnings of a transforma- tion, then SHRINKS to the size of a mouse. Laughing, he crawls out of his human-size pajamas. \nCUT TO: \n4    OMITTED                                                     4 \nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/28/90                          4. \nA5   INT. ATTIC - SAME TIME                                     A5 \nSolemn and mournful, ten-year-old Wednesday has black hair and white skin like her mother. She sits on a stool among the stored Addams' family objects, ONE END OF A \nSTRING TIED TO HER TOOTH, THE OTHER TIED TO A TRAP DOOR. \nThe trap door is flung open, GRANNY pokes her head through. She's a giggly hag who looks like she was in the bathtub when the hairdryer fell in. Wednesday's pulled tooth swings at the end of the string. \nWEDNESDAY \nThank you, Grandmama. In a foul mood, Granny tromps up into the attic. \nGRANNY \nYou kids are going to have to kill your own breakfast this morning. Wednesday opens a cigar box. Inside the box are assorted human and animal teeth, fangs and dentures, along with a collection of glass eyes. Wednesday drops her tooth in the box. \nCUT TO: \n5    OMITTED                                                    5 \nA6   INT. GOMEZ AND MORTICIA'S BEDROOM - SAME TIME              A6 \nGomez takes Morticia in his arms. As she languidly drapes herself across his chest, she is caught in a sudden shaft of sunlight. She squints. On the bedside table beside her, Morticia's OVERSIZED CARNIVOROUS \nORCHID WILTS. \nMORTICIA \nGomez... the sun... il me perce comme un poignard. \nGOMEZ \nGOMEZ \n(disturbed) Granny - where's your fog? \n(CONTINUED) \nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/28/90                        5A . \n7   CONTINUED:                                                 7 \nFROM ABOVE \nthe fog machine hurtles downwards, missing decapitating Gomez by millimeters.

ENTRANCE HALL - LATER                                 9 \nStanding beside the front door is LURCH, the gigantic family butler, a reanimated stitched-together behemoth. He holds two brown paper lunch bags in his enormous hands. The bags' contents wriggle, eager to escape. \nWEDNESDAY \n(taking her bag) Thank you, Lurch. \n(CONTINUED) \nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/6/90                           6. \n9    CONTINUED:                                                 9 \nPugsley takes his bag, opens it, and peers inside.

Gomez sits at a table, playing CHESS with Thing. \nGOMEZ \nIt's a milestone, Tish. This very evening -- our twenty-fifth seance. All those years, gnawed by guilt, undone by woe, burning with uncertainty... \nMORTICIA \n(yearningly) Oh Gomez, don't torture yourself. That's my job. \nGOMEZ \n(lustfully) Tish... \nMORTICIA \nImagine, Darling, if Fester did come back. Half-alive, barely human, a rotting shell... \nGOMEZ \nDon't tease. \nCUT TO: \nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY - 12/3/90                          8. \n14    EXT. JUST OUTSIDE THE ADDAMS' GROUNDS - SAME TIME          14 \nTULLY ALFORD, the family attorney, and his wife, MARGARET, approach \"GATE,\" a wrought-iron monstrosity that opens of its own accord. Though Tully comes here often and Margaret has been here before, they never cease to be startled by \"Gate.\" Tully has a puffy, once handsome face, and an embittered grey aura that is the mark of a middle-age misspent. High-strung and superficial, Margaret is more disap- pointed in Tully than he is in himself. Margaret passes through Gate first. Then, as Tully passes through, Gate slams on him, clipping him and catching the end of his coat. Tully fights Gate for his coat. \nTULLY \nLet me go! Ignoring Tully, Margaret continues stiffly up the walk. \nTULLY \n(to Gate) Gimme that! Stop it! I'm warning you! It's not a good day! \nCUT TO: \nA15   INT. CONSERVATORY - SAME TIME                              A15 \nGomez moves a chess piece. Thing gestures out the window. Gomez and Morticia both look out.

Lurch distributes torches, then stands aside, awaiting instructions. Pugsley helps Gomez unroll an ancient map of the area. \nGOMEZ \nFan out. Pugsley - head for the dung heap. Mama and Morticia - the shallow graves. I'll take the abyss, and Lurch - check the bottomless pit. \nMORTICIA \n(worried) Her favorite... \nGOMEZ \n(calls out) Fester!! \nFESTER (O.S.) \nUp here. They look up at Fester, looking down at them from Wednesday's window. \nGOMEZ \nWhat are you doing? \nTULLY \nRelaxing.   Taking a little sun. \nABIGAIL \nHave you gone mad? \nTULLY \nAu contraire. Tully closes the book and smugly unfurls a LEGAL DOCUMENT. \nCUT TO: \nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY - 2/19/91                         88 . \n119    EXT.

UNDERGROUND GROTTO - MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT              122 \nMorticia and Granny stand in the middle of the dripping dankness. Stalagmites. Stalactites. Granny's torch casts scary shadows on the cave walls. \nGRANNY \n(calling out) Wednesday! Wednesday! \nMORTICIA \nA two-story NEON ARROW points the way to this bungalow court -- Bright and awful ersatz western. LOG CABINS OF SIMULATED WOOD surround the TEEPEE-SHAPED OFFICE. The Addams' Duesenberg is parked in front of the furthest cabin. The asphalt has been ripped up in big chunks and Lurch's tree is parked next to the Addams' new home. \nCUT TO: \n131   INT. BUNGALOW - SAME TIME                                    131 \nC.U. DRESSING TABLE MIRROR \nMorticia leans into frame. With an icepick and a hammer, she deftly makes a large spidery CRACK in the round mirror. Sighing deeply, she stands back to admire her handiwork. Granny joins her. \nGRANNY \nI like it. Her mother pats her consolingly. \nMORTICIA \nJust as long as we're together, n'est pas, mon cher? As she turns to Gomez, we see the interior of the bungalow -- all ersatz cowboy and Indian mixed with chrome-plated plastic and orange shag carpet. \nGOMEZ \nsits slumped in a   chair made from wagon wheel and nauga- hyde. It's as if    all of his insane, vibrant energy has been leeched from   him. He's a broken man. He looks back at her as if he's   never heard French. \nGOMEZ \nHuh? Wednesday tends to him.    She and her mother exchange a worried look. \nPUGSLEY \ncomes from the bathroom, nibbling a wrapped bar of motel soap. \nPUGSLEY \nThis place isn't so bad. They even put candy in the bathroom. \nMORTICIA \nThat's the soap, dear. \n(CONTINUED) \nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/20/90                           93 . \n131    CONTINUED:                                                    131 \nPUGSLEY \nOh. He takes another greedy bite. Wednesday pats her father's arm. \nMORTICIA \nWe are Addamses, and we will not submit. Who recalls the fable of the tortoise and the hare? The swift, yet lazy little cottontail, and his slow but determined companion? What does that story teach us, as Addamses? \nGRANNY \nKill the hare. Skin it.   Boil it. \nWEDNESDAY \nPut the tortoise on the highway. \nPUGSLEY \nDuring rush hour. \nMORTICIA \nYes! We will survive! Poison us, strangle us, break our bones - we will come back for more. And why? \nGRANNY \nBecause we like it! \n(CONTINUED) \nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY - 11/12/90                        94A. \n133   CONTINUED:                                             133 \nPUGSLEY \nBecause we're Addamses!

Is he currently employed? \nMORTICIA \nHe's... he's going through a bad patch at the moment. But it's not his fault. \nPERSONNEL OFFICER \n(with some bitterness) Of course not. What is he - A loafer? A hopeless layabout? A shiftless dreamer? \nMORTICIA \n(wistfully) Not anymore.

Gordon - where should we go first? \nFESTER \n(sadly) I don't know... \nABIGAIL \nAcapulco? Cancun? (she snaps her fingers in the air, castanet- style, trying to be festive) Ariba!

The room is sunny and cheerful, with crayon drawings taped to the walls. \nMORTICIA \n... and so the witch lured Hansel and Gretel into the candy house, by promising them more sweets. And she told them to look in the oven, and she was about to push them in, when, low and behold, Hansel pushed the poor, defenseless witch into the oven instead.

Gomez lets the phone drop. Morticia, seated on the edge of the box spring, tries to comfort him. Pugsley, Wednesday and Lurch are seated nearby, very worried about Gomez, as at a death watch. Gomez is now surrounded by junk food, and a mountain of junk food wrappers, bags and styrofoam containers. Ritually, as handmaidens, Morticia brings Gomez the remote control for the TV, and Wednesday brings him a copy of TV Guide. Pugsley brings Gomez a bag of \"Doritos\", and Lurch brings him a canister of \"Pringles\". \nGomez uses the remote to switch channels.   An episode of \"The Cosby Show\" comes on. \nGOMEZ \nRe-run.

She just said that. \nCOUSIN IT \nOoot oot gleep. \nGOMEZ \n(to It) You remember, old sport - she really did find him tangled in a tuna net, twenty-five years ago. With amnesia. \nWEDNESDAY \nFrom the Bermuda Triangle. \nCOUSIN IT \nOoot oot oot. \nMORTICIA \nHow true.

Fester faces Gomez. \nFESTER \nMy own dear brother - who could be more precious? \nGOMEZ \nBlood is thicker than water, old man. \nMORTICIA \n(touched by the brothers devotion) And just as refreshing.

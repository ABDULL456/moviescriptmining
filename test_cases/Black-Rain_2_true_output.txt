NICK I'd like that. 
Ich sits down with two fresh bowls of soba noodles.  Nick hesitates. 
ICH You can do it. 
Nick picks up his chopsticks with his good hand.  He begins to slurp the noodles. 
ICH Louder, pal, louder. 
NICK Joyce, give the assistant Chief Inspector a drink, would you? 
As Joyce refills all their cups we... 
SLOWLY DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT.  EIGHT THREE PRECINCT - NEW YORK CITY - DAY 
It's raining.  A sun shower. 
INT.  POLICE STATION 
Capt. Oliver is standing by the window watching the rain pour down. 
OLIVER ... Remember, counterfeiting is the Feds.  They'll be all over Abolofia's place.  Stick tight. You I.D. the other plate, he does real time. 
NICK Right. 
Reveal Nick sitting in front of Oliver's desk, his one arm is still in a sling.  Nick gets to his feet. 
OLIVER (still not facing him) You know, Nick, if you'd held on to that plate, you could've been a very rich man. 
Oliver turns to face Nick.  Nick just looks at him, then: 
NICK Never crossed my mind. 
Oliver nods; he believes him. 
OLIVER Be careful on the run. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SQUAD BAY - NIGHT 
In contrast to the Japanese police station -- it's chaos. Cops are in every imaginable kind of dress, trash cans over flow, a handcuffed prisoner screams abuse to anyone who will listen. 
THE RAIDING PARTY 
a dozen men in all, are donning flak jackets and windbreakers with POLICE and TREASURY stenciled on the back. 
NICK 
walks in with two heavy bullet proof vests slung over his shoulder.  He squeezes past the raiding party to find 
ICH 
sitting at a desk, thumbing through a Frommer's guide to New York City.  Nick drops one of the vests on the desk. It lands like a ton of bricks.  Ich continues to read. 
A Sergeant walks in. 
SERGEANT Saddle up.  Hard team in the first unit.  Conklin, your RMP awaits. 
The cops and treasury men, grabbing their gear, head for the door. 
Nick is struggling to get into his vest using one arm. 
NICK Sure you want to come?  Probably better than the Greyline Tour. 
Ich stands up, shoves the guidebook in his back pocket. He helps Nick fasten the strap in back. 
ICH You wouldn't make it without me. 
Nick smiles, takes the Frommer's out of Ich's pocket and tosses it into the trash. 
Nick hands him a shotgun, takes another one off the rack for himself. 
We watch from behind as the two men head down the long hallway toward the exit. 
ICH Think we'll get him, Nick? 
NICK We can't lose. 
ICH How can you be so sure? 
Nick opens the door at the far end of the hallway.  They step out into the sunlit rain. 
NICK Cause you're the biggest thing to hit this town since... 
Before Nick can finish his line, the door SLAMS SHUT behind them. 
FADE TO BLACK.

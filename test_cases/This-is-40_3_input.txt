DEBBIE Hey guys. 
LARRY Look how big the kids are. Sadie! 
He gives Desi a hug. 
DESI Hi, Larry. 
LARRY (to Sadie) Hi, Sadie. 
SADIE Mom. Who is Oliver? 
DEBBIE What do you mean? 
CHARLOTTE Is he your dad? 
DEBBIE He is my biological father. 
CHARLOTTE What does that mean? 
DEBBIE He and my mom had a baby and that was me. 
SADIE Oh, so you're our grandpa. 
OLIVER Why don't you ask your mother? 
DEBBIE Yes, well, that would make him your grandpa. Do you want him to be? 
CHARLOTTE Yes. Then we get another grandpa. Come on! 
Oliver gets up. Charlotte, Sadie and Desi run off. Oliver follows. 
LARRY That was deeply uncomfortable. Thank god the pretty girl was here to divert our attention. 
EXT. POOL - DAY 
Desi is gracefully swimming under water. She looks gorgeous. She sees Jason and Ronnie under water, but they look grotesque, red-faced and awkward. They both reach for each other and come to the surface. 
JASON Oh, hi. I did not see you there. 
RONNIE I saw you there. 
DESI Did you guys come together? Are you a couple? 
RONNIE / JASON No, we didn't come together. Absolutely not. 
DESI Sorry, the mustache is a little-- 
JASON That's fair. 
DESI I just assumed. 
RONNIE This is a straight man mustache. 
DESI What is the different between a gay man's mustache and a straight man's mustache? 
Pause. 
JASON The smell. 
DESI Excuse me. 
Desi swims away. 
EXT. BACKYARD - LATER 
Larry is talking to Oliver. 
LARRY So, spinal surgery just seems to me to be at the top of the surgery chain. 
OLIVER Well, we're not cardio, we're not neuro, but I like to think we're an important part of the spectrum. 
LARRY Do you operate every single day? 
OLIVER Most days. 
LARRY Multiple times a day? 
OLIVER Three, four times. 
LARRY So what's the price range? Like if I wanted-- 
OLIVER Oh, I'd rather not say. 
LARRY It's so big you're embarrassed to say. 
OLIVER I wouldn't say embarrassed. 
LARRY Are there hunchbacks today? 
OLIVER Of course. 
LARRY I've never seen one. 
OLIVER Well, that's because there are spinal surgeons. 
LARRY That's because of you. Each time I don't see a hunchback, you're getting that much richer. 
Oliver smiles, amused. 
LARRY (CONT'D) You like The Beatles, don't you? 
OLIVER Who doesn't like The Beatles? 
LARRY Nobody.

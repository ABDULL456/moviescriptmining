ERIC They all know who you are. (to the rest of them) Ne soyez pa salauds.  Offrez une biere au plus grand perceur de coffres. 
Oliver stands up and walks to the kitchen. 
OLIVER (with an English accent) Zed, would you like a beer? 
ZED Thanks. 
OLIVER Don't think of it. 
CLAUDE (to Zed) Come.  Sit down. 
INT. ERIC'S FLAT - KITCHEN - NIGHT 
The kitchen is an absolute pig stye.  Dishes are piled up in the sink and on the counter. 
Oliver grabs a glass that has some old beer in it and empties it.  He scratches some filth off of it and pours some beer into the glass. 
INT. ERIC'S FLAT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Zed takes a seat on the couch next to Claude. 
Suddenly, a SPIDER MONKEY dressed in a little Uncle Sam costume comes screeching up onto Zed's lap and then up onto his head, the whole time clawing at his eyes. 
Eric, amused, turns from the men playing cards and smiles. 
CLAUDE (to Zed) Easy.  Don't scare him.  He just wants to claim you. 
Zed is frozen as the monkey climbs around him and then onto Claude's shoulder. 
CLAUDE Let me introduce you properly.  This is Enrique. 
The monkey screeches. 
CLAUDE He likes to be called Chim Chim, but we don't always get what we like...do we? 
Again, the hideous creature screeches. 
CLAUDE (to Enrique) Tais-toi! (then to Zed) Do you like hash? 
Then Eric interrupts. 
ERIC (jokingly) Don't sit next to that junkie. 
CLAUDE Ahhhhhh! 
Claude throws a lit cigarette at him which explodes into a mass of sparks.  They laugh. 
ERIC (to Claude) That little shit monkey of yours pissed on my Billy Holiday albums.  Next time he's out the door. (to Zed) Zed, come here. 
Zed gets up and goes with Eric to the bedroom.  On the way Oliver hands him the glass of beer. 
OLIVER Here you go mate. 
ZED Thanks. 
Oliver sits down next to Claude. 
INT. ERIC'S FLAT - BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Eric's bed has probably never been made.  In fact, this room looks a lot like Quentin Tarantino's old apartment.  But, there is a certain order to all this chaos.  Eric pulls out a blueprint and spreads it out over the bed. 
ERIC Don't ask me where we got this. 
ZED Okay. 
ERIC On Bastille Day, all the banks are closed. 
He places his hand on the blueprint. 
ERIC But this one.  BIP.  The Banque Internationale de Paris.  And for being greedy capitalists perhaps they will remain closed next Bastille day.  Yes? 
Zed smiles. 
ERIC We will go in and shut the bank down. Now, look at this. 
Eric pulls out a complex electronic schematic. 
ERIC As you can see, only one person can start the alarm. (he hands it to Zed) The concierge, at this desk. (he points it out on the blueprint) We will take care of him.  Then we can close the bank.  No one will know the difference since every other bank will be closed. 
ZED (turning the schematic around) Are you sure he won't push the alarm?

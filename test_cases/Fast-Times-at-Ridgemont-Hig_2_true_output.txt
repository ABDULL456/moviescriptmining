STACY I guess it is getting late, Mark. 
She shrugs him off, walks him to the door. 
EXT. THE HAMILTON HOME - NIGHT 
We see The Rat's forlorn face as he trudges towards his car. He stops. He takes a breath -- it wasn't that late, he really didn't want to leave. The Rat turns and begins walking back up the Hamilton steps. Just as he does so, Stacy's bedroom light clicks off. It was too late. He kicks at his car. 
THE RAT You blew it, asshole. 
Behind him, recklessly speeding towards Ridgemont Drive, is Charles Jefferson's blue Mustang. 
EXT./INT. THE BLUE MUSTANG - NIGHT 
Jeff Spicoli is behind the wheel. Sitting next to him is Little Charles, "L.C.", Jefferson's younger brother. They're smoking grass and holding Lowenbrau beers in between their legs. The radio is blasting the music of Rick James. 
L.C. Hey, slow down. This is my brother's car. 
SPICOLI I thought he was out of town. 
L.C. He is. 
SPICOLI Then don't hassle it. 
They speed off down Ridgemont. 
L.C. Seen the new Playboy? 
SPICOLI Naw. Any good? 
L.C. Suzanne Somers' tits. 
SPICOLI All right. 
L.C. I like sex. 
Spicoli sees something in the rearview mirror. 
SPICOLI Hold your beer down, L.C., I think it's a cop. 
Spicoli slows down. The car behind him slows down. 
SPICOLI (CONT'D) This is a cop. He's definitely cruising me at busting distance. 
The high beams switch on behind Spicoli. 
SPICOLI (CONT'D) What the fuck is this guy doing? 
The car behind Spicoli then advances to the point where it is now almost touching the blue Mustang. 
SPICOLI (CONT'D) What the fuck is this guy doing? 
L.C. This ain't no cop. 
The mystery car bumps them lightly from behind. 
L.C. (CONT'D) Hey! He's gonna scratch my brother's car! 
The two boys start yelling. High beams fill the Mustang with bright light and... 
EXT./INT. MUSTANG AND GRANADA 
Then mystery car pulls back, then up alongside Spicoli and L.C. on the left. We hear the music on the radio of George Thoroughgood's "Ride On, Josephine". 
SPICOLI It's a bunch of Jocks in a Granada! 
L.C. They're fuckin' with us. 
The drivers of the two cars eye each others. Then the Granada begins inching over, trying to force Spicoli off the road. 
L.C. (CONT'D) My brother's car! 
SPICOLI All right. Die, Granada Jocks! 
Spicoli guns ahead, in a real bullet move, and easily overtakes the Granada. Spicoli is proud of himself. He checks himself out in the rearview and turns to L.C. 
SPICOLI (CONT'D) Would you roll your window up, L.C.? It's messing my hair. 
Spicoli pulls way ahead of the Granada, while L.C. rolls his window up. Spicoli looks over to L.C. and smiles wickedly. 
Now Spicoli wants to show off. He pushes the pedal to the floor. 
L.C. We just missed the turnoff to the party. 
SPICOLI You know the thing I love about Mustangs? The steering wheel.

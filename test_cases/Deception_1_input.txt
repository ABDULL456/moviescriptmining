ALSIP You work in a bank? 
JONATHAN Nahh, I'm... I'm kind of an accountant. us,, Now I bet that's just what you wanted to do when you were a kid! 
JONATHAN Oh yeah. I'm living the dream. Feel free to leave now. u S â Still here. 
JONATHAN So what about you? 
âSÂ» No, we're still on you, Frank. Off Jonathan's look, 'Frank'? 
âS.11 You look like a Frank. So, Frank, when you were a little boy, what did you wanna be when you grew up? .Jonathan thinks. Confesses: 
JONATHAN A pro tennis player. 
âS,. Huh! I wanted to be an umpire. 
JONATHAN You're kidding? âsâ Really! I loved the idea of sitting in that big, high chair. (umpire voice) 'The ball was good,'Mr McEnroe.' 
JONATHAN I can see it. An 80's new wave love song comes on the radio. She beams, reaching across Jonathan to turn it up. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: a, S 11 I used to love this song. "S" stands up on the bed, starts to dance. She reaches her hand out to Jonathan. He smiles, shakes his head. 
JONATHAN Trust me, it's not a pretty sight. 
"S:, I'll be the judge of that. He hesitates, then takes her hand, rises to his feet, and starts to dance with her. He's self-conscious at first, but she's agile enough to guide him, and soon he's into it. is S Il See? You just need the right partner. She closes her eyes, swaying with the music. They dance together. He's falling even harder for her. As the song ends she holds his gaze -- when a small yawn escapes her. She covers her mouth. of S+â I'm so sorry. Suddenly I'm crashing. She drops down on the bed, tugging him down with her. They lie back, side by side. 
JONATHAN I'd like to see you again. Not in a hotel. it S+ " Hmm. I'd have to think about that. 
JONATHAN How about tomorrow? /. S to It is tomorrow. She curls up next to him, rests her head on his arm, closes her eyes and drifts off. Jonathan gazes over at her. The perfect line of her jaw. The petite divot above her lip. The tiny pierced comma in a presently unadorned earlobe. And then he notices, in the far corner: her purse. He stares at it; her name and personal details less than 20               feet away. He hesitates, then tries to silently slide his arm out from under her -- when she stirs and nuzzles closer. He looks over

INT. THE HUDSON - HOTEL ROOM - MORNING 
CLOSE ON JONATHAN'S SLEEPING FACE. His eyes slowly open. JONATHAN'S POV: her purse is no longer on the chair. He raises his head, sees that she's gone. He stares at her pillow. The indentation where she slept. Smiles to himself. He gets out of bed and heads for the bathroom. There's a NOTE on the desk on hotel note paper: Frank - you snore like a tractor. Will call u later. Sunbeam xxx He stares at the note, beaming - when his cell phone rings. Jonathan picks it up. 
MAN'S VOICE                                                     (V.0..) Are you free tonight? A bea- - and then Wyatt's familiar laughter. 
JONATHAN Hey! Are you back in town? 
WYATT (V.0.) I wish. It's friggin' anarchy in the U.K.. I'm stuck here at least another week. 
JONATHAN Oh. Because I thought I saw you last night - at the Hudson. 
WYATT (V.0.) The Hudson, huh? Sounds like you've been enjoying my little gift. 
JONATHAN Yeah. I mean, I was. Only now - well, I met a girl. Not just any girl. The girl. 
WYATT (V.0.) That's fantastic! Who is the lucky gal? 
JONATHAN She's a member of your naughty little sex club. I have broken all the rules and had an honest-to-God conversation. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
WYATT (V.0.) That's extremely naughty of you! So what happened, Romeo? 
JONATHAN I'd like to say it's a long story but it's not. When you are coming back, you gotta meet her. 
WYATT (V.0.) So she's, what, a lawyer or something? 
JONATHAN I-have no idea, I don't know all that much about her. All I know is I can't wait to see her again. 
WYATT (V.0.) Listen, I don't want to dampen your spirits, but - be careful, okay?

Was Route 18 your first choice? \nKIMBERLY The new freeway was faster, but Route 18 was the way my mom used to take, so... \nThey take turns going around the room. \nTHOMAS Route 18 is Drake's assignment, but he called in sick so I got... (blanches) Drake's never sick. \nKAT I was my first day of jury duty. \nEUGENE Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security numbers. \nCLEAR Random, sure. \nEUGENE What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago? You're nuts. \nClear fumes. Rory looks ill and reaches into his wallet. \nRORY Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means \"good luck\" in Jewish. \nKAT Eighteen. And it's \"Hebrew\". \nRORY Anyway, I guessed it right and won these. \nRory holds up two Yankee tickets. \nRORY The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18. \nKIMBERLY I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance. \nTHOMAS (realization) Whoa, nine months? \nKIMBERLY Are you thinking what I'm thinking? \nINT. CHEAP MOTEL - NIGHT \nANGLE ON ISABELLA'S PREGNANT BELLY. \nREVEAL she's lying down, binging on take- out food, while speaking on the motel phone. A disturbing metallic SQUEAK SCRAPE -SQUEAK can be heard, nearly drowning out the SCREAMING COUPLE next door. \nISABELLA Yes, I'd like to report a domestic squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz why, does it matter? I'm at the Super 8 motel. Yes, I own a white van. So what? Just get over here. \nIsabella hangs up, recoiling at VIOLENT THUMPS against her wall. PULL BACK AND UP TO REVEAL the source of the unsettling SQUEAK is a rickety, wobbling CEILING FAN. \nINT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nKimberly whispers into the phone. \nKIMBERLY I'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard time with Shaina's eulogy. I'll stay here at Virginia's tonight and see you tomorrow. I love you too. \nShe hangs up, looking guilty for having lied to her father. Clear keeps her eyes on the pens that ROLL on the slightly canted table into the about-to -fall White Pages directory. \nCLEAR Remember everyone, just because Kimberly's got the power doesn't mean we're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent. \nThe pens softly tap the phone book one by one until it lazily tips over and PLOPS HEAVILY onto a GOOSE-DOWN THROW PILLOW. \nSmall feathers from the pillow are carried upwards by the breeze. Everyone in the room watches them rise. \nRORY It's like Forrest Gump. \nThey float across the room, ultimately landing on a MOUSETRAP! SNAP! The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber - which tips and slowly slides down the wall. \nClear, in a chair, looks directly above her head at a LARGE SWORDFISH mounted on the wall. \nThe Grabber picks up speed, arcs downward and hits the mounted SWORDFISH. The supporting brackets give, causing the SWORDFISH TO TIP and SLIDE DOWNWARD! \nClear lurches back in her chair just in time - the razor sharp bill impales the seat cushion between her legs! \nCLEAR Fuck. Should have seen that coming. The institution's made me soft. \nClear gets up, carefully easing herself around the swordfish. Eugene isn't quite sure what to make of what he's just seen. \nEUGENE If Death has got such a hard-on for you, maybe you should get the hell away from us. \nKIMBERLY We need her. She's the only one who's dealt with this before, idiot! \nKimberly looks self-conscious by her outburst. Clear, however, looks grateful. \nCLEAR We're all going to have to open our eyes from now on. Look out for each other. Sleep in shifts. (looks around apartment) And we've got to safeproof this deathtrap. \nMONTAGE - SAFEPROOFING THE APARTMENT \nEveryone but Nora and Eugene helps unplug appliances, put out the fire, take down hanging objects, switch off the gas, put sharp objects away, affix padding to chart corners... \nKat, placing poisonous cleansers and flammable liquids in a box, nervously pulls out a pack of smokes. Thomas watches as he takes a hanging mirror off the wall. \n", "test1_true": "THOMAS You think you should?     It's not safe out there. \nKAT So? Nora's gotta bite it before me anyway, right? \nKat steps towards the front door, then remembers the cell phone and grabs it just in case. Thomas smiles 'good job' at her. \nKimberly, unscrewing the light bulb, looks up when Nora rises from the couch in a stupor and struggles to put on her jacket. Kimberly looks concerned. \nKIMBERLY Where are you going, Nora?    You okay? \nNora fights the sleeve, dazed and defeated. \nNORA Four years ago my husband died. Now Tim. There's nothing left for me. \nKimberly stops pouring liquor down the drain. \nKIMBERLY Don't say that. Once you lose hope, it's already too late. \nEugene snickers. Nora looks up, anger surfacing. \nNORA If it's my time to go, to be in heaven with my family, then I can accept that. \nKIMBERLY You can't give up. Don't accept Death's plan. Trust me, you can fight this. If we can just survive long enough until that baby is born, we can -- \nNora looks more resolute than ever. \nNORA If you'll excuse me, I have a funeral to prepare. \nEveryone looks crushed when Nora heads for the door. Except Eugene, who stands up as well. \nEUGENE Yeah, why am I listening to a girl who just got out of the nut house? \nAs Eugene heads out, Kimberly becomes enraged and grabs him. \nKIMBERLY Seeing you die once was enough for me. \nEUGENE Whatever. I control my life, not fate. \nCLEAR I'll be sure to put that on your tombstone. \nRory presses a cell phone into Eugene's hand on his way out. \nRORY Be careful. And even if you don't believe, give this to Nora. \nINT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nEugene pushes the elevator button a thousand times. Nora nervously ties her long hair back in a single braid. \nINT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nThe nervous group finishes safe-proofing the apartment. \nRORY, standing on the couch, pulls a POLICE ACADEMY DIPLOMA off the wall - and slips - stumbling BACKWARDS into the closet. \nStaggering, he accidentally knocks some COAT HANGARS and a VOLLEYBALL TROPHY from the high shelf to the floor. \nThomas whips around and sees that Rory's not hurt. He then lowers his gaze and sees -- \nThe figurine of a VOLLEYBALL TROPHY is framed by a tangled jumble of wire COAT HANGARS. Suddenly, STREETLIGHT FLICKERS ON for the evening. Oddly, it only illuminates the Trophy/Hangar array. \nFrom Rory's vantage point, it looks like a surreal sculpture of a man with hooks emanating from his body. The sodium vapor lamp casts an OMINOUS GLOW around the image. \nRORY ...man with hooks. I see a man with hooks. Someone?!?! \nThe others look over, trying to see what he does. \nTHOMAS (unsure) I kinda see it, yeah. So...Nora's going to be killed by a man with hooks? \nKimberly and Clear stare at the volleyball trophy - the street lamp ominously FLICKERS OUT AND DIES. \nEveryone looks around for a hesitant beat, then Thomas picks up his cell phone. Clear first walks, then RUNS out the door. \nINT. THOMAS' APARTMENT BUILDING - CONTINUOUS \nThe elevator finally comes. Eugene and Nora get inside, standing in front of a gaunt looking man holding a cardboard box full of PROSTHETIC LIMBS. \nMUZAK plays AC/DC's HIGHWAY TO HELL. \nEUGENE Going down, right? \nThe Gaunt Man says nothing.

Small town deputy STEVE ADAMS, 30's, CLEANS HIS GUN in her direction. \nISABELLA What do you mean \"grand theft auto?\" This is insane. \nSTEVE Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday mor ning. \nISABELLA (figures it out) Jorge. When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off. \nAs she fumes, a rivulet of WATER streaks down her leg. \nIS ABELLA Oh my God. \nSteve, at first confused, sees the water and gasps. \nSTEVE Are you kidding me?!   Oh, man. \nHe rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell. \nSTEVE C'mon.    Let's go. \nAs Steve throws on his jacket, we reveal its prominent emblem: GREENWOOD LAKE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT. \nEXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - MOMENTS LATER \nSmall town station. Only one patrol car. In the patrol car, Isabella buckles up in the sho tgun seat, the belt stretched tightly across her belly. \nDeputy Steve tries the ignition, but the car won't start. \nSTEVE Damn, they always stick me with the clunker. \nISABELLA Take my van! \nEXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - DAY \nKAT'S EXPEDITION speeds through a yellow light and continues on. \nCLOSE ON EXPEDITION'S LEFT TIRE \nMetal sheers away more rubber. \nINSIDE THE EXPEDITION \nRory, antsy, rubbing his nostrils, stares at two Yankee tickets. \nRORY Here's what I don't get. For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up... \nKAT Yeah? \nRORY But why single me out? What am I in the great scheme of things? You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man. \nTHOMAS You want weird? Last year, my partner and I were heading out for the graveyard shift. A call comes in about a train wreck and Frank decides to let me handle it alone. \n(beat) Frank died that night in a shootout. I'd be dead too if that call had come in just ten seconds later. \nEveryone nods in that 'life's weird' reverence kind of way. \nKAT I got that beat. So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night. \nRORY Yeah, so what happened? \nKAT I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop. \nCLEAR Was that in Mt. Abraham? \nKAT Yeah.   How did you know? \nCLEAR (sinking realization) That bus you were on? It killed Terry Mathers. She was supposed to die on Flight 180. \nKAT I'm not sure I-- \nTHOMAS Shit. The call about the train wreck that saved my life? That was the night I scraped up Billy Hitchcock. \nRORY Who? \nKIMBERLY Another kid from Flight 180. \nA chill passes over the group. \nINT.

WINDING ROADS \nBRIAN GIBBONS, 15, cheerfully drives a TRACTOR hauling a WHOODCHIPPER across the high crest of the empty road toward a pile of thick branches. \nThe Tractor unexpectedly stalls in the middle of the road. He tries the ignition, pumps the gas. Nothing... \nOnly by standing on the tractor can Brian see the White Van speeding up the hill toward him. He jumps down and frantically tires starting the tractor. Once, twice, nothing. \nEXT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS \nCU FRONT TIRE - METAL shreds away more rubber. \nINT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS \nRory excitedly makes a connection. \nRORY Remember the theater in Paris that collapsed last year, killed everyone inside? \nEveryone nods, anticipating... \nRORY I had tickets to go, but one day I'm in Paris, trippin' on acid, sippin' lattes an' such, and this dude gets whacked by a falling sign. \nCLEAR Carter. \nRORY Freaked me out so bad I hid in a shopping cart for four hours. 'Course, missed the show... \nCLEAR \nWhat about you, Kimberly?   Did you anyone from Flight- ? \nClear stops when she sees all the color has drained from Kimberly's face. Even Eugene looks concerned. \nEUGENE Are you okay? \nThe car becomes completely silent (except for the slight SCRAPING) as Kimberly prepares to tell her story. \nKIMBERLY A little over a year ago, my mother and I went to the mall. I was supposed to meet her outside, but I got caught up watching some news report about some kid who committed suicide. I kept thinking, \"How can you strangle yourself in a bathtub?\" That's retarded. \nThomas mouths, \"Tod?\" to Clear. Clear nods. \nKIMBERLY It felt wrong. And yet... (continuing) There were gunshots outside and I ran... (chokes up) Some kids tried to jack her car. She fought them off - she was a fighter - and they killed her. \nKimberly looks to Clear. \nKIMBERLY After the funeral I had this overwhelming feeling that it should have been me. I figured that's how everyone must feel. But I guess I was right. \nThomas reaches between the seats and takes Kimberly's hand. As he looks into her eyes, Kat takes her own eyes off the road to light a cigarette. \nINTERCUT BRIAN \nThe tractor is safely off the road next to a wood pile. Brian grabs a cord and starts up the whoodchipper. \nINT. KAT'S EXPEDITION - CONTINUOUS \nCLEAR It's all starting to come together. When Alex got us off Flight 180, it didn't just change our lives. It \naffected everyone and everything we've come into contact with ever since. \nEUGENE I'm not sure I understand. \nCLEAR Being alive after our time caused an outward ripple - a rift in Death's design. \nEugene nods, slowly getting it. \nEUGENE So if you never got off the plane, none of us would be ali ve in the first place. \nCLEAR That's why Death is working backwards. It's tying up all the loose ends, sealing the rift once and for all \u00ad \nThis chapter of the screenplay contains scene(s) that do not appear or occur elsewhere in the final movie.

Suddenly, some forgotten stray chunk SHOOTS from the spout -- \nThe airborne chunk of WOOD CRACKS the White Van's windshield. Steve veers out of control. \nKat sees the White Van ahead swerving into HER LANE. She quickly jerks the wheel to the right. \nKat's LEFT FRONT TIRE BLOWS! It sends rubber flying and the entire SUV pulls hard to the left, spinning her out of control into the oncoming lane of traffic - toward the White Van! \nIsabella SCREAMS! Steve jerks the wheel to the left! The White Van has a close near miss with the Expedition, and goes off the road toward a LAKE! \nSTEVE Hang on! \nThe SUV misses the tractor -- but sails off the other side of the embankment, spinning and rolling towards -- \nTHE GIBBONS' FARM \nAt the bottom of the hill of a large rural farm, a PROPANE TANK sits at the edge of the property! \nThe SUV barrels down the hill - coming right for it! \nINSIDE THE SUV \nAll Kat can do is cover her head with her arms. \nTHE WHITE VAN \nSpeeding toward the lake! Isabella SCREAMS, in pain, not fear. The White Van is ready for splashdown. \nSteve finesses the hand brake while tapping the accelerator. He's able to right the van away from the water without so much as a hard jerk. \nSTEVE We're okay, we're okay. \nTHE PROPANE TANK \nIt's about to get creamed - but the bouncing Expedition just barely misses it! It continues, backwards, CRASHING through a temporary fence and right into -- \nAN AGRICULTURAL CONSTRUCTION SITE! \nThe Expedition plows past earth movers, crashing through irrigation ditches and pipes, shrapnel flying everywhere. \nJust as the Expedition comes to a stop, an IRRIGATION PIPE ROCKETS through the rear window -- miraculously missing Clear and Rory -- coming to a rest just behind Kat's head. \nINSIDE THE WHITE VAN \nSteve sees the wreckage on the other side of the highway and slows down. Isabella squeezes his hand white. \nISABELLA Please.   It's not going to wait. \nSTEVE I've got to stop and help those people. \nISABELLA Do you want to deliver this baby? \nSteve looks ill, then sees another car stopping by the crash. He floors it and speaks into the shoulder mic of his cop radio. \nTHE EXPEDITION \nThe dust settles in the silent car. The only sound is a QUIET, WET WHEEZE. Clear, dazed, looks around carefully, avoiding the METAL SPIKE that skewers the vehicle. \nRory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed to see it. Kimberly shakes her hair, spilling glass onto the floor. Kat tries to open the door, but it won't budge. \nKAT Not my time.     Amazing... \nTHOMAS Is everybody alright? \nA BLOODY HAND SEIZES HIS SHOULDER! \nThomas turns to see \nEugene SPASMING in the back seat! He clutches his ribcage in agony and wheezes! Blood trickles from his mouth. \nKAT He can't breathe!        He can't breathe! \nCLEAR Oh my god, Eugene!? \nEugene's head tilts forward, unconscious. \nEXT. GIBBONS' FARM - DAY \nBRIAN GIBBONS jumps off the tractor and sprints down the hill toward the accident. At the edge of the property is a common farm FENCE made from wooden posts bridged by two thick wires. \nBrian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a DEAD OAK TREE ten feet inside the fence. In the BG, MR. GIBBONS darts inside a double-wide construction trailer. \nMR. GIBBONS (O.S.)

I think his lung's collapsed! \nCLEAR Someone call for help! \nWe STEADICAM around Brian to reveal a woman screaming from the driver's seat. The sound is surreal. \nKAT I can't move my fucking leg! Please get me out of here before it explodes! \nThe color drains from Brian's face as the dying man on the ground coughs blood and the girl performing CPR recoils. \nThe moment is still surreal as Brian steps back, further away from the horrors he can't face. Into the street -- \nAnd Rory yanks him back from imminent death as an AMBULANCE SPEEDS onto the property. \nRORY Watch it, dude! \nThat SNAPS Brian back to reality. Sounds become normal again. Brian collects himself and SNIFFS the air. He then drops to ground level, looking under the Expedition for something. \nKIMBERLY Help us, we need help over here! \nBRIAN (to Kat, reassuringly) I don't smell any gas. And none's dripping, either. \nBrian sticks his head in Kat's window and peers down at her trapped leg. He swipes the broken glass away from the window with this thick flannel sleeve, reaches in, and tries to YANK the door open with all his might. \nNo good, Kat SCREAMS in pain. \nKAT Stop that! I still need this foot, thank you. \nBrian steps back as the emergency vehicle speeds over. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GIBBON'S FARM - LATER \nClear watches two EMTS lo ad Eugene into the back of an ambulance. An oxygen mask has been placed over his mouth. \nCLEAR Be careful with that, check the gages on the regulator and be mindful of overdoses. Oh, watch for potholes and puddles. \nAs Clear continues, the exasperated Paramedics do their best to ignore her. When she tries to climb inside, she is pushed away. \nCLEAR Look, I made him a promise -- \nPARAMEDIC Sorry.   There's no room. \nAgain, she's shoved away and steps back, helpless. \nThomas and Kimberly stand by Kat, still trapped in the SUV. \nTHOMAS Get that over here!   Move move move! \nA RESCUE WORKER carries the JAWS of LIFE past Clear towards the Expedition. \nRESCUE WORKER Excuse me, hot soup coming through. \nThe hydraulic hose that leads back to the Power Unite WRAPS AROUND CLEAR'S LEG. \nAs the hose tightens, Clear realizes she's surrounded by shards of glass and metal. She quickly WRESTLES herself free of the hose and watches the Paramedics lock Eugene's gurney into place. \nCLEAR One more thing.   Watch out for power lines. \nThe doors slam, revealing the PHELPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL logo. The ambulance speeds off, spraying gravel at her. \nShe reaches into her pocket and withdraws a CRUSHED cell phone. Shit. She runs back over to Thomas. \nCLEAR We have to contact Isabella now! \nA NEWS VAN tries to weave through the emergency vehicles to get closer to teh accident. \nANGLE ON NEWS VAN UNDERCARRIAGE \nIt sinks into the loose dirt, SCRAPING A LARGE ROCK. The gas tank PUNCTURES. \nEMT'S angrily wave the news van back to the road, where it parks near the twin wire fence opposite the DEAD OAK TREE. \nImmediately, A CAMERA CREW exits the van to catch the action.

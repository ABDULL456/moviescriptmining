{"train": "FINAL DESTINATION 2 By J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress \nFADE IN: \nINT. DARK ROOM - NIGHT \nTITLES OVER: \nA padded wall is papered with NEWSPAPER CLIPPINGS that date back to the early 1900s: \n\"LOCAL FOWLER BROTHERS LOSE $35 TICKETS TO BOARD TITANIC\" appears over \"FOWLER BROTHERS KILLED IN COAL MINE MISHAP.\" Another series of articles reads, \"JEWISH PROFESSOR DENIED ADMITTANCE TO HINDENBURG\" and \"PROFESSOR RABINOWITZ KILLED IN AVALANCHE.\" Etc... \nContinuing along the wall, the newspaper articles all focus on the fates of the original SURVIVORS of the FLIGHT 180 CRASH. \nWe DISSOLVE between the various headlines depicting the gruesome deaths of Tod, Terry, Ms. Lewton, Billy Hitchcock, Carter and Alex Browning. \nAlso in the mix are various CRIME SCENE PHOTOS of the deaths. \nDecapitated torsos, crushed, mangled bodies, the charred remains of another and the face- down body of Alex Browning. \nMAPS line the walls as well, pinpointing the locations of numerous deaths, perhaps seeking a pattern. Charts that timeline bizarre deaths, seating charts of downed aircraft, etc... \nLATEX -GLOVED HANDS tear out the last article, apply fun- tack to its corners and place it in the center of all the others: \nA REMEMBRANCE FOR THE VICTIMS OF FLIGHT 180 \nFriday marks one year anniversary. \nEND TITLES. \nFLASH TO BLACK as a HAND ENTERS FRAME, PULL BACK TO REVEAL: \nEXT. KIMBERLY'S NEIGHBORHOOD - DAY \nKIMBERLY BURROUGHS, 19, puts a folded AAA map in her mouth. She opens the back of a RED NISSAN SUV, and pla ces her duffel bag inside. \nThat done, she lets the map drop from her mouth, catches it in her free hand and turns to hug her father, MR. BURROUGHS. \nKIMBERLY Thanks, Dad. I'll call you. \nMR. BU RROUGHS You have everything, Kimberly? Credit card, cell phone, AAA card? \nKIMBERLY Relax, Dad. It's Daytona, not Mongolia. \nMR. BURROUGHS (playful) Fix -A-flat? Road flares? Sunblock? Mace? \nSHAINA (O.S.) Condoms, handcuffs, lube? \nKimberly and Mr. Burroughs turn to see -- \nSHAINA, 19, tall leggy brunette. Tan, tight tube top revealing her pierced navel, Kimberly's best friend. She walks up the driveway with her bags. \nSHAINA Just kidding, Mr. B. Don't worry, I'll keep an eye on her. \nMR. BURROUGHS (sarcastic) Oh, that makes me feel a lot better. \nShaina throws her bags in, shuts the back and climbs in the SUV. Kimberly hugs her dad, kissing him on the cheek. \nKIMBERLY I know this is the first time we've been apart since. But everything's gonna be okay. \nMR. BURROUGHS I know, honey. I just -- \nKimberly hugs him tighter. Cutting him off. \nMR. BURROUGHS Your mother would have been so proud of the way you've handled yourself through all of this... \nKIMBERLY (softly) I know, Dad. \nSHAINA (O.S.) Hello, the guys are waiting! \nKimberly gives him a quick kiss, jumps behind the wheel, starts the car and pulls away as Shaina cranks up the stereo. \nMR. BURROUGHS Buckle up! \nMr. Burroughs waves as the girls roar off. As he looks down he spots an OIL STAIN left by Kimberly's SUV. As he drags his shoe across the stain, a SLIGHT BREEZE blows past his face. \nCAMERA PUSHES IN as a look of concern crosses his face. \nEXT. HIGHWAY ON RAMP - DAY \nON OLD WOMAN \nAs she pushes her supermarket cart up the on ramp. A SQUEAKY WHEEL is shrill and disturbing. \nDRIVERS of several waiting vehicles avoid staring at her weathered face as she passes. Up ahead waiting in line, is Kimberly's red SUV. \nKIMBERLY I will, Dad. Bye, luv you. \nKimberly passes a STATION WAGON on her right, the DRIVER squinting at a map while driving. A mattress and some furniture tied to the top SHIFT as the wagon hits a bump. \nSHAINA Um, Kimberly, your dad's not gonna call like every ten minutes is he? \nBefore Kimberly can answer, Dano sees a CHP speeding up behind him. He lowers the joint at once. \nDANO (hiding bag of weed in pants) Shit! There's a cop behind us. Pull into the right lane now! \nKimberly, scared, does as she's told nearly colliding with a speeding flat bed semi hauling a huge load of logs ! \nA HORN BLASTS. The truck swerves. Then speeds by on the right. A COILED CHAIN drops down to the highway. \nDANO Look first, idiot! \nShaina turns up the radio and leans over to Kimberly. \nSHAINA Ignore 'em. \nON LOG TRUCK \nOne end of the RUSTY CHAIN holding the logs in place rattles on the pavement, sparking. \nLooking in her rearview mirror, Kimberly turns pale - the COP pulls in behind her. \nKIMBERLY Dano, put that out NOW. \nDano takes one last drag and flicks the joint out the window. It bounces on the windshield of a FORD EXPEDITION to their left. \nINSIDE THE EXPEDITION \nKAT, 28, very corporate America, wears a navy blue power suit and speaks into a phone headset while smoking a cigarette. \nKAT \nNo, I'm stuck on Jury Duty so I won't be able to pitch the campaign. Let's get Silverstein to come in and... \nKat sees the joint that smoulders in the dried leaves beneath her windshield wipers. A moment later, a small FLAME crackles. \nKAT What the hell?     No,   not you. \nKat flicks on her WINDSHIELD WIPER FLUID, successfully putting out the joint, but her worn wipers smear ash and fluid around, impairing her vision. \nKat turns and looks at -- \nDANO, dead serious all of a sudden. Staring straight ahead. \nDANO What's the cop doing?      Did he see that? \nKat sees the tailgating CHP, smiles, then resumes her conversation. \nKAT Forget it, I'll call him myself. \nKat hangs up, then looks down at her cell phone, squints and dials a number... \nPAN OFF KAT TO OFFICER THOMAS BURKE \nEarly 20's, rookie cop, who seems to have missed the entire exchange. \nINSIDE THE POLICE CAR \nThomas speaks into his radio. \nTHOMAS I was supposed to be off today. How did I get screwed? \nDISPATCHER (O.S.) No biggie. Drake called in sick. \nTHOMAS Copy that. (switches off; annoyed) Go on, sleep it off Drake. \nThomas tries to sip from a McDonald's coffee cup on the dashboard, but it's TOO HOT. He places it back on the dash. \nThe VIBRATIONS of the road make the COFFEE CUP slide closer and closer to the edge of the dashboard. \nBACK TO KIMBERLY'S SUV \nDano nervously looks back. \nFRANKIE Relax, dude. \nBut Kimberly still looks uneasy as her dashboard \"Check Engine\" light begins flickering. \nKimberly spots a road sign -- Next Service 18 Miles. \nKIMBERLY This trip better be wor th it. What's the guy- girl ratio again? \nINSIDE TRANS AM \nIts driver, EVAN SCHAEFFER, 21, flashes a cocky smile at Kimberly, clearly making Frankie jealous. \nFRANKIE A Trans Am. That shit went out with New Kids on the Block. \nDANO \nYeah. Who does he think he is? Knight Rider? \nFRANKIE (laughs; then) Who? \nFrankie leans out and tosses milkshake on Evan's window. \nDANO You know, Hasselhoff before he did Baywatch. \nEvan, pissed off, flips off Frankie. The windshield wipers smear around the thick milky fluid. The sun blinding him. \nKIMBERLY What's the chance of finding a nice mature guy once we get to Daytona? \nSHAINA How does a nice mature fuck sound? \nKimberly laughs, then leans in close to Shaina. \nKIMBERLY Hey, thanks for talking    me into this trip. Ever since     my mom... I dunno, I just feel like    I'm starting to live again,    you know? \nShaina smiles in understanding. \nINSIDE POLICE CRUISER \nThomas bends to wipe up the mess. He only glances at the road as he tries to soak up the coffee. \nSuddenly up ahead, THE RUSTY CHAIN SNAPS! The logs roll off the side of the truck onto the highway. \nOne bounces as it hits, and slams through Thomas' front winshield and out the back, taking Thomas' head with it. \nEUGENE slams on his brakes. His Harley slides out and he is SLAMMED to the ground, sliding at 60 miles per hour across the highway, right in front of the yellow mini-bus. \nThe MINI- BUS DRIVER brakes to avoid Eugene. The FOOTBALL PLAYERS tumble forward and hit him in the head. He loses control and slides off the road onto the grass median. \nHe blows a front tire and the mini-bus begins to flip, ROLLING several times int o the oncoming lanes of traffic, and is HIT by a MACK TRUCK. \nEugene slides into a huge log, and hits it with a sickening crunch. Only to be HIT and CRUSHED by his sliding motorcycle. \nRory looks up too late and REAR ENDS Thomas' car, EXPLODING the gas tank and HURLING Rory's dead body halfway through the windshield where it remains half in/half onto the hood. \nKAT, dialing, looks up, slams on her brakes, but SKIDS on oil from the Chevette. She swerves into Kimberly, SIDE SWIPES her, then swerves to miss a huge log -- only to run head on into two more, flipping the Expedition end over end right next to Kimberly. \nKimberly swerves back from being hit by Kat, just in time to see a huge log ahead. She tries to turn hard to the right to avoid it, but hits it broadside -- \nSending the SUV FLIPPING OVER the top of the log and SLIDING down the road. Inside, Shaina, Dano and Frankie are tossed around like rag dolls, shredded by glass and shrapnel -- Frankie is EJECTED out the side window. \nKimberly's SUV slides to a stop on its side. She looks back to her mangled but still alive friends and up in time to see \nNORA'S PACER \nNora sees the collisions ahead and slams on the brakes but the fallen Naya bottle prevents her from braking, and she SLAMS into the back of Kat's Expedition. \nThe crash test dummy collision folds her Pacer and it EXPLODES into a huge fireball. \nEVAN, blinded by the smeared windshield, is too late. He swerves his Trans Am around the burning cars onto the wet grass. \nKimberly sees the topless Trans Am slowly roll out of a huge WALL OF FIRE and coast to a stop. Evan comes up battered and bloody but still alive. He is trapped in his burning car, screaming and trying to release the seatbelt. \nThen, just when she thought it was over, a HUGE SEMI slides thro ugh the wall of fire, SMASHING the Trans Am out of the way, SPINNING it like a top. With the back sliding at 90 degrees it keeps on coming. \nKIMBERLY'S POV \nThe semi's grill comes right at her! \nCU ON KIMBERLY \nShe screams and we -- \nCUT TO: \nTHE HIGHWAY O N RAMP - NISSAN SUV - 8 MINUTES EARLIER \nSweating profusely, Kimberly's eyes dart around, taking in her surroundings... \nDANO (O.S.) Flight 180. You know, that plane crash with those kids from Mount Abraham. \nThe Old Woman BUMPS the window - scaring the shit out of everyone. \nThe kids ad-lib \"Let's go\" and \"Fucking Freak!\" \nKIMBERLY No!   We'll all die if we do! \nThe cop turns on his FLASHERS. \nDANO I told you she'd ruin everything! \nSHAINA Shut up, Dano, just stay cool. (to Kimberly) He's just stoned. \nOfficer Thomas Burke exits his car and approaches the passenger side of the SUV, hand on weapon. Thomas taps the window with his knuckle. \nTHOMAS What's going on here? \nKIMBERLY (incoherent, through tears) There's going to be a pile up. Logs. Bodies everywhere. I saw it happen. It happened. \nThomas looks to the guys in back who shrug, \"we don't know her.\" \nTHOMAS Miss, please step out of the vehicle. \nAs she does, Thomas discretely unsnaps his holster. RORY nervously eyes the action. Sneaks a paper bundle into his sock. ISABELLA, the pregnant woman in the White Van, gets out. She gives Thomas her friendliest smile, milking the pregnant belly. \nISABELLA Excuse me, but is there some way we could just drive around? I have a delivery. \nHer CELL PHONE RINGS and she leans back inside to answer it. \nISABELLA Hey hon, you got a mysterious caller on the answering machine from Planned Parenthood. What's going on? \nAs she listens, growing agitated, the Harley Rider dismounts and pulls off his helmet. Revealing EUGENE DIX, 35, a nebbishy school teacher in cool leathers. \nINSIDE PACER \nNORA watches the SUV, distressed. \nNORA What on Earth are they doing? \nTIM (picking up two Naya bottles) Who am I, David Blane? \nNora gives Tim a hard stare, then they both break into smiles. Nora tousles his hair. And doesn't stop. \nTIM (good-natured laughter) Okay, quit it already. \nAs he laughs, something pains his jaw and he winces. THOMAS isn't quite sure what kind of insanity he's dealing with yet. Dano and Frankie, no help, stare dead ahead. \nKIMBERLY (trying to calm herself) The radio played the same songs, the old lady's bag broke the exact same way it did in my premonition. \nKimberly erupts into a panic when she sees the LOG TRUCK speed past. She grabs at Thomas for emphasis. \nKIMBERLY THAT's the truck that's going to kill everyone! \nTHOMAS Alright miss, calm down. I just need this lane open. I need you to pull your vehicle onto the shoulder! \nKIMBERLY You're not listening to me!   You have to do something! \nEVAN impatiently yells out the window of his TRANS AM. \nEVAN Arrest this whack-job, wouldja? Some of us have lives, y'know. \nKimberly looks to Shaina for support, but even Shaina can't meet her eyes. \nKIMBERLY Why won't anyone listen to me? \nThomas, subtly reaching for his cuffs. \nTHOMAS I'm not going to tell you to calm down again -- \nA SERIES OF CRASHES AND EXPLOSIONS ARE HEARD. In the distance. It's neverending. Horrific. Kimberly's face crumbles. She screams in horror and collapses against the SUV. \nThomas runs to his patrol car. \nThe White Delivery Van makes a J- turn out of the line of cars and SPEEDS down the onramp in reverse, Isabella screaming angrily into her cell phone. \nISABELLA You couldn't keep your dick in check for a month?! \nThe other drivers exit their cars, craning their necks to see what's happened up ahead. Kat takes a deep drag off her smoke. \nKAT Great, now I'm really gonna be late. \nThomas barks into the radio handset -- \nTHOMAS L.A. 51, I need assistance and requesting paramedics for a major T.A. At -- \nINSIDE THE SUV \nFrankie watches the traffic start to back up as a couple of passing cars BRAKE HARD. Shaina anxiously watches Kimberly pacing behind the SUV. \nSHAINA Kimberly, what's going on? \nDETECTIVE SUBY Officer Burke? Could I see you in here? \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe DOOR OPENS. Detective Suby enters, leading Thomas. Through a two - way mirror, they can see the others chatting anxiously. \nDETECTIVE SUBY Tell me you didn't start up on that Flight 180 shit again. (beat) Did you? \nTHOMAS \nOf course not. That would be irresponsible and unprofessional. \nDetective Suby's persistent glare makes Thomas uncomfortable. \nTHOMAS Look, you weren't there. It was weird. She knew that log truck was gonna cause an accident, she knew. (beat) Never mind. \nDETECTIVE SUBY I thought we we re finished with this bullshit. This is police work, not the psychic Hot Line. \nBut Thomas isn't listening. He's glued to Kimberly's words. When Detective Suby realizes this, he stops and listens. \nKIMBER LY But if I was never meant to pull over, then we all should have died in the pile up. \nTIM Which means Death could be coming for us. \nDetective Suby looks pissed o ff. \nDETECTIVE SUBY Way to console the witnesses Burke. \nAt the same time, we watch Evan enter the other room, grab his jacket and wave goodbye to the others. \nDETECTIVE SUBY You got 'em thinking Death is after them? Shit, they're the luckiest sons o' bitches on the planet. Get this guy Evan Shaeffer; Yesterday the kid wins the lotto and today some looney bitch b locks traffic and he avoids the worst pile up in years. I should be so damn unlucky. \nINT. A ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nKimberly, Nora, Tim, Kat, Eugene and Rory now seem affected by what they've heard. \nKAT \nWhat if it's true? What if it's happening all over again? \nThe fluorescent light above FLICKERS ominously. Nora, disturbed, stands up in a huff, grabbing Tim's arm. \nNORA You're all certifiable, you know that? I can't believe I've been listening to this crap. Come on, Tim, let's go outside. \nTIM Jeez, Mom, stop trippin'. \nEUGENE Look lady, we're just yankin' your chain. \nRORY Yeah, you're acting like we all just got the Diff'rent Strokes curse or something. \nEugene and Rory burst out laughin g. Nora shakes her head, disgusted. \nNORA What's wrong with you people? \nNora pulls a reluctant Tim out of the room. As she opens the door, the others watch Detective Suby and Thomas appear from nowhere to calm her down . When the door swings shut, an awkward silence. Suddenly, the door opens again and Thomas leads Mr. Burroughs inside. Mr. Burroughs sees Kimberly and chokes back tears. \nMR. BURROUGHS Kimberly... \nThe sight of her fath er crying is enough to make Kimberly's own dam burst. She rushes over to him and buries her head in his chest, sobbing. \nMR. BURROUGHS Can I take her home? \nThomas nods. \nDETECTIVE SUBY Sure, you can all go. \nBy now, the fluorescent light flickers out of control. When Rory, Kat and Eugene stand up, Thomas looks helpless. \nKAT First I'm stuck with Jury Duty, now this nonsense. \nRORY Yeah, I hate to love and leave ya, but I've been over this X-Files shit since the sixth season. \nAs Thomas watches them file out, the fluorescent light POPS. Then DARKNESS. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nKimberly sits at the table. Mr. Burroughs sets down a cup of tea before her. Both are shaken. \nKIMBERLY I know it's crazy, but I'm really scared for the others. I've got this terrible feeling. \nMR. BURROUGHS What feeling? \nKIMBERLY That it's not over yet. \nShe picks up the tea, it clatters in her trembling hands. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThe room is dark except for one burning candle. Kimberly tosses and turns. The wind sends a single branch scraping against her window. A porch swing SQUEAKS back and forth. Adding to her anxiety. \nA BREEZE ENTERS, sputtering out the candle. Kimberly sits upright in bed and sees the WINDOW IS SHUT. Huh? She lights a match and sees the candle wax dripped onto her table, forming the gooey shape of a...180? The match goes out in her hand. The room is dark again. \nHeadlights fr om passing cars cast eerie shadows on her ceiling. Shadows resembling PLANES seem to transform into a SKULL. \nKimberly, freaked out, looks around to see the blinking light from the VCR: it flashes 18:0 a few times, then 12:00. \nShe can't take it anymore. She yanks the VCR cord from the wall and flicks on the lights, ridding the room of shadows. And anxiously turns on her computer. \nEXT. STONEYBROOK HOSPITAL - DAY \nKimberly drives a beat up Hyundai through an eerie morning mist that surrounds the grounds of the Stoneybrook Hospital. \nANGLE ON \nA computer printout in the shotgun seat: MAPQUEST directions to \"Stoneybrook Hospital\". \nAs Kimberly drives through the gate, the mist almost seems to follow her inside. \nA SIGN offers a choice between \"Emergency/Medica l Care\" or \"Psychiatric Treatment Center.\" Kimberly drives to the mental ward. \nINT. MENTAL WARD - DAY \nA PHYSICIAN in a lab coat leads a nervous Kimberly down the center of a long corridor. The Physician consults a clipboard. \nPHYSICIAN ...at the request of the patient, you are to relinquish any sharp objects such as nail files, pencils, pens, safety pins, bobby pins, no matches, lighters, belts, belt buckles, earrings, chokers, shoelaces... \nKimberly watches carefully as the Physician comes to a door and punches \"4514\" into the electronic lock. They continue down another corridor. \nLights flicker,patients cackle and moan in the B.G. \nPHYSICIAN ...paper clips, watches, food, drinks, keys, poisons, pills and medications. (looks at Kimberly) You have a cell phone on you? \nKimberly nods, hands it over. \nPHYSICIAN Then I think we're all done. \nThey arrive at a door to a padded room. The Physician punches in another code. \nKIMBERLY Wait. Is she...dangerous or something? \nPHYSICIAN No honey, but she expects you are. \nKIMBERLY Jesus, how long are you going to keep her locked up this way? \nPHYSICIAN Depends on her, I guess.   She's voluntary. \nThe door hisses open. \nINT. CLEAR'S PADDED ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nREVEAL CLEAR RIVERS \nWhile still beautiful, this young woman bears few traces of her former self. Her eyes dart around suspiciously, maddened by chronic paranoia. Her hair is patchy, her eyes dark and haunted. Bordering on savage. Her movements are fidgety, erratic, always distracted by something unseen. \nKIMBERLY Clear Rivers? \nClear looks Kimberly up and down and steps back, allowing her inside her inner sanctum. A mattress on the floor, a plastic bottle of water, some paperbacks and a bedpan. \nKimberly's jaw drops when she sees the far wall: a SHRINE to flight 180. The wall is papered with art icles about all the survivors (as seen in the opening title montage). \nThe door SLAMS. Kimberly jumps. \nCLEAR Kimberly Burroughs, eh?    What do you want? \nKIMBERLY I thought...I thought you might be able to help me. \nCLEAR (snicker) Yeah, how? \nKIMBERLY I had a premonition about the Route 18 pile up. .. I saved some people. And now I think Death is after me. \nCLEAR Nice work. Maybe if you're real lucky, you'll wind up in here with me. (gives Kimberly the once over) But I doubt you'll survive that long. \nKimberly flinches. \nKIMBERLY It's not just about me. Someone I saved died last night in a freak accident. What if the others are in danger, too? \nCLEAR Well, if you put them on the list, they're already tits up. \nKIMBERLY What list? \nBACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE \nSLOW DOLLY up to Tim. Choking, gurgling. His eyes are open, but rolled up. His hand limply reaches up...then drops. \nSounds of commotion in the next room seem to fade away as we continue our SLOW DOLLY into Tim's eyes. \nThey GLAZE OVER...the choking stops. And a HAND reaches into frame and pulls the puffer fish out of Tim's mouth. \nREVEAL JEAN looking petrified at the close call, looking around to make sure nobody saw... \nEXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER \nNora and Tim, feeling better now, walk past the CONSTRUCTION CREW. A CRANE OPERATOR smiles at Tim, who smiles back. \nFrom across the mall, the tiny running figures of Kimberly and Thomas appear in the dis tance, pointing and screaming. \nTIM What are they doing here? And why are they yelling \"pigeons\"? \nJust then, Tim and Nora walk into a large cluster of PIGEONS who suddenly burst into flight, startling the Crane Operator, whose hand inadvertently jerks a lever - \nA METALLIC CHAIN RATTLE fills the air and Tim looks up just as a HUGE SHEET OF GLASS PLUMMETS downward toward him and CRUSHES him, his mangled body visible underneath. \nAs two pearly whites roll around on the sidewalk, NORA SCREAMS. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - LATER \nEmergency vehicles everywhere. Thomas seems exhausted as he walks back to Kimberly, who stands by his car. In the BG, EMTs load a stretcher into an ambulance. \nTHOMAS (shaking his head) Nora's not coming. She refuses to leave her son. \nKIMBERLY We have to tell her she's in danger! \nTHOMAS (sadly) I did. And right now, I don't think she cares. \nEXT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - DAY \nThomas' car turns into the driveway and parks. Kimberly holds up her hand and watches it tremble. \nKIMBERLY It's happening again.   It's fucking \nhappening again. I hoped we'd get there and they'd be okay, that Clear Rivers was full of shit and Evan's death was just a freak accident... \nThomas kills the engine to listen. \nKIMBERLY But we're all going to die. We can't stop it. It's just a matter of time. I'm so scared. \nThomas takes her hand and squeeze s it reassuringly. \nTHOMAS I am too. But you can use that fear. It'll sharpen your instincts. Keep you alert fro signs. It's the only way you'll be able to sav e the others...and me. \nKimberly, seeming overwhelmed, pulls her hand back. Thomas senses he's losing her, and softens her approach. \nTHOMAS I know you didn't ask for any of this, Kimberly. But I don't think you have it in you to quit either. \nKimberly stares straight ahead, the weight of the world sinking in. BANG! A startling pound on the roof of Thomas' car. \nKimberly jumps, then spins around to see: \nCLEAR RIVERS - standing in the driveway. A determined, powerful presence. Kimberly exits the car. A MOMENT where Kimberly and Clear stare each other down. \nKIMBERLY Clear/Thomas. Thomas/Clear. \nClear nods absently to Thomas, still focused on Kimberly. \nKIMBERLY (bitter) The second one just dies.   A 16 year old kid. \nCLEAR (nods; a faint trace of guilt) I hope you're ready for this. \nEXT. FUNERAL HOME - DAY \nThomas' car pulls into a partially filled parking lot. Kimberly, Thomas and Clear file out and head to the door. \nKIMBERLY This is cheery. \nTHOMAS Who is this guy, anyway? \nCLEAR A mortician. He seemed to know a hell of a lot more about death than he ever told us. \nTHOMAS Should we knock? \nCLEAR (looking ill) He probably already knows we're coming. \nINT. FUNERAL HOME - MOMENTS LATER \nHe makes a fist, is about to knock - when the DOOR FLINGS OPEN and a ROTTWEILER LUNGES for his throat - only to have its collar snagged at the last second by its owner - \nJORGE CRUZ, late 30's, handsome, cocky. He speaks above Rotty's BARKING: \nJORGE What? \nTHOMAS I'm Officer Burke.    I'm looking for an Isabella Cruz. \nSuddenly, with an unexpected fury, Jorge SCREAMS at his dog. \nJORGE Shut up!!! \nThe Rottweiler cowers, and Jorge shoves it to the floor, where it lands on its feet and fearfully trots away. Jorge's face is once again pleasant, but it's a thin veneer. \nJorge sees Clear and Kimberly behind Thomas and frowns. \nTHOMAS Are you Jorge Cruz? \nJORGE Maybe.   What's this about? \nTHOMAS May we come in? \nJORGE No.   What's this about? \nANGLE ON CLEAR - eyeing what appears to be DROPS OF BLOOD on the tile floor. She takes in what she can see of -- \nTHE ROOM \nAs if a tornado had hit it. Wedding photos smashed and torn. Furniture over-turned. \nTHOMAS (a little stern) It's about your wife, Isabella. Now is she here? \nJorge's eyes flicker ever -so- involuntarily behind him. \nJORGE No.   I'm alone. \nBut by now, Thomas has seen everything Clear has and more. He stares through the house, into a bedroom and sees - \nA FEMALE FOOT lying half0buried under the bedspr ead. \nTHOMAS Look, pal, it's probably nothing. But I need to see -- \nJorge is already closing the door. \nJORGE Forget it. You'll need a warrant. I know, I'm a lawyer. \nClear rushes the door, shoulders it and expertly wriggles past Jorge's grasp. \nJORGE Stop!!!   You can't go in there!!! \nClear tears into the bedroom, grabs the bedspread and THROWS it to the floor to reveal a YOUNG WOMAN, naked, trembling with fear, takes a closer look at Clear. \nYOUNG WOMAN We never meant to hurt you Isa...You're not Isabella! \nMeanwhile, Jorge yells at Thomas. \nJORGE I'm going to sue your ass! \nKIMBERLY Whose blood is that on the floor? \nDefensively, Jorge holds up his arm. Freshly cut. \nJORGE Mine, you idiot. The dog went nuts this afternoon. Now arrest her! \nKIMBERLY Where's Isabella? Did you finally kill her you fucking wife beater? \nJorge flinches. It's time to come clean. \nJORGE We had a fight. Some things got broken, the dog went crazy, she left me. Wouldn't say where she was going. \nTHOMAS What was the fight about? \nJORGE Take a guess. \nTHOMAS Does she have a cell phone?   A way we can contact her? \nJORGE She did. \nHe eyes a SHATTERED CELL PHONE on the floor. \nCLEAR We're wasting time with this piece of shit. Let's just get to the meeting. \nJorge turns to soothe the frightened Young Woman in the bed. \nJORGE Hey, when you find her, tell her the kid's half mine. \nCLEAR What about the rest of you? Kimberly, you were driving to Daytona. Was Route 18 your first choice? \nKIMBERLY The new freeway was faster, but Route 18 was the way my mom used to take, so... \nThey take turns going around the room. \nTHOMAS Route 18 is Drake's assignment, but he called in sick so I got... (blanches) Drake's never sick. \nKAT I was my first day of jury duty. \nEUGENE Jury duty? That's randomly selected by social security numbers. \nCLEAR Random, sure. \nEUGENE What, you think Death planned for each of us to die in the pile up weeks ago? You're nuts. \nClear fumes. Rory looks ill and reaches into his wallet. \nRORY Last July I dialed a wrong number and got a radio station by accident. They asked me what number means \"good luck\" in Jewish. \nKAT Eighteen. And it's \"Hebrew\". \nRORY Anyway, I guessed it right and won these. \nRory holds up two Yankee tickets. \nRORY The best way to get to Yankee Stadium is Route 18. \nKIMBERLY I don't know what's weirder, the dialing a wrong number part or that Death would set you up nine months in advance. \nTHOMAS (realization) Whoa, nine months? \nKIMBERLY Are you thinking what I'm thinking? \nINT. CHEAP MOTEL - NIGHT \nANGLE ON ISABELLA'S PREGNANT BELLY. \nREVEAL she's lying down, binging on take- out food, while speaking on the motel phone. A disturbing metallic SQUEAK SCRAPE -SQUEAK can be heard, nearly drowning out the SCREAMING COUPLE next door. \nISABELLA Yes, I'd like to report a domestic squabble - my name? Isabella Cruz why, does it matter? I'm at the Super 8 motel. Yes, I own a white van. So what? Just get over here. \nIsabella hangs up, recoiling at VIOLENT THUMPS against her wall. PULL BACK AND UP TO REVEAL the source of the unsettling SQUEAK is a rickety, wobbling CEILING FAN. \nINT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nKimberly whispers into the phone. \nKIMBERLY I'm sorry, Dad, we're having a hard time with Shaina's eulogy. I'll stay here at Virginia's tonight and see you tomorrow. I love you too. \nShe hangs up, looking guilty for having lied to her father. Clear keeps her eyes on the pens that ROLL on the slightly canted table into the about-to -fall White Pages directory. \nCLEAR Remember everyone, just because Kimberly's got the power doesn't mean we're not all capable of seeing signs to some extent. \nThe pens softly tap the phone book one by one until it lazily tips over and PLOPS HEAVILY onto a GOOSE-DOWN THROW PILLOW. \nSmall feathers from the pillow are carried upwards by the breeze. Everyone in the room watches them rise. \nRORY It's like Forrest Gump. \nThey float across the room, ultimately landing on a MOUSETRAP! SNAP! The trap flies over and knocks into the base of the unstable Grabber - which tips and slowly slides down the wall. \nClear, in a chair, looks directly above her head at a LARGE SWORDFISH mounted on the wall. \nThe Grabber picks up speed, arcs downward and hits the mounted SWORDFISH. The supporting brackets give, causing the SWORDFISH TO TIP and SLIDE DOWNWARD! \nClear lurches back in her chair just in time - the razor sharp bill impales the seat cushion between her legs! \nCLEAR Fuck. Should have seen that coming. The institution's made me soft. \nClear gets up, carefully easing herself around the swordfish. Eugene isn't quite sure what to make of what he's just seen. \nEUGENE If Death has got such a hard-on for you, maybe you should get the hell away from us. \nKIMBERLY We need her. She's the only one who's dealt with this before, idiot! \nKimberly looks self-conscious by her outburst. Clear, however, looks grateful. \nCLEAR We're all going to have to open our eyes from now on. Look out for each other. Sleep in shifts. (looks around apartment) And we've got to safeproof this deathtrap. \nMONTAGE - SAFEPROOFING THE APARTMENT \nEveryone but Nora and Eugene helps unplug appliances, put out the fire, take down hanging objects, switch off the gas, put sharp objects away, affix padding to chart corners... \nKat, placing poisonous cleansers and flammable liquids in a box, nervously pulls out a pack of smokes. Thomas watches as he takes a hanging mirror off the wall. \nEugene stares blankly at the CONCAVE MIRROR in the upper corner. He's disturbed by the WARPED REFLECTION OF: \nTHE GAUNT MAN leans closer to Nora's hair and as the doors finally close, he leans over and SMELLS it. Creepy. \nEUGENE Um, by the way, your shoe's untied. \nNora bends down to tie her shoelace (the one that snapped). She tries tying the long dangling shoelace to the stubby one as Eugene's cell phone VIBRATES in his hand. Startled, he drops it to the floor. Then looks embarrassed. \nEUGENE Probably for you, anyway. \nNora picks it up. STATIC CRACKLES. It's hard to make out Thomas' yelling. \nNORA Officer Burke?   I can't hear... \nA beat of confusion, then she slowly turns to see the clawed hooks and hands of the Prosthetic limbs. Terror. She freezes. \nEUGENE What is it? What's wrong? \nBut Nora's too frightened to speak. Eugene grabs the phone, hearing unintelligible STATIC. \nINTERCUT CLEAR \nAs she frantically hits the elevator button. When it fails to come, she runs downstairs. \nINT. ELEVATOR - CONTINUOUS \nNora slowly rises to her feet, feverishly mouthing a prayer... As the door opens, Nora rushes out - unseen to her, her long braid gets snagged on one of the PROSTHETIC HOOKS, YANKING her backwards. \nNORA Let me go let me go! \nEUGENE Oh, watch it, you've caught your uh... \nThe Guant Man's sweet voice and demeanor are a clear contrast to his outward appearance. \nMAN Goodness gracious, darling, let me help you with... \nNora panic,s as Eugene and the Man try to untangle her braid. Nora desperately spins her body around, sticking her head back inside the elevator. \nKat appears in the lobby, smoking a cigarette. \nKAT You alright, Nora? \nThe elevator DOORS begin to close, and CLAMP around Nora's neck, her head inside, body outside the elevator. \nEugene pounds on the BUMPERS, but they don't seem to work! \nNORA My God, someone please let me out of this -- \nINTERCUT \nThe UP BUTTON is lit. Clear rushes to the lobby. \nThe Elevator RISES! \nINSIDE THE ELEVATOR, Eugene watches Nora's head drop to floor level - then he pounds the Emergency Button - which SHORTS OUT! \nNora's body lifts upwards from the force of the elevator floor! \nNora's screams of terror and agony fill the air as the elevator repeatedly LURCHES UPWARDS. \nKat gasps in horror to see this poor woman suspended above the floor. \nIt lurches. And lurches. And lurches. The horror never ends. \nClear comes from the stairwell and is shocked by the sight. She runs to the elevator doors, trying to pry them apart to no avail. \nAll Kat can do, crying, is grab hold of Nora's flailing legs and try to pull her back down. \nThe elevator lurches a final time. NORA'S HEADLESS BODY fall down into Kat's arms, knocking her to the floor. Kat freaks, skittering away as the body convulses. \nINSIDE THE ELEVATOR \nEugene balls his hands to his mouth in undeniable fear. A bloodcurdling moan escapes him. He stares transfixed as Nora's head, still aghast in terror, rolls around the floor. \nThe sight clearly sends Eugene over the edge. He SCREAMS, CLAWS AND POUNDS, desperate to escape the elevator. \nINT. THOMAS' APARTMENT - MOMENTS LATER \nEugene suddenly bursts through the door, babbling incoherently. Kimberly, Thomas and Rory look on, bewildered. \nEUGENE ...no escapes my ass. I control my fate. I die on my terms, hear me Reaper cockscuker?! \nEugene's in another world. He approaches Thomas and lunges for his GUN - yanking it from the holster! \nTHOMAS What the hell are you...? \nINT. SHERIFF'S STATION - DAY \nIsabella, pissed, is in a holding tank. Small town deputy STEVE ADAMS, 30's, CLEANS HIS GUN in her direction. \nISABELLA What do you mean \"grand theft auto?\" This is insane. \nSTEVE Hopefully the district judge can straighten it all out by Monday mor ning. \nISABELLA (figures it out) Jorge. When I get out of here I'm going to sue his cheating ass off. \nAs she fumes, a rivulet of WATER streaks down her leg. \nIS ABELLA Oh my God. \nSteve, at first confused, sees the water and gasps. \nSTEVE Are you kidding me?!   Oh, man. \nHe rushes across the room, pulls a lever, unlocking the cell. \nSTEVE C'mon.    Let's go. \nAs Steve throws on his jacket, we reveal its prominent emblem: GREENWOOD LAKE SHERIFF DEPARTMENT. \nEXT. SHERIFF'S STATION - MOMENTS LATER \nSmall town station. Only one patrol car. In the patrol car, Isabella buckles up in the sho tgun seat, the belt stretched tightly across her belly. \nDeputy Steve tries the ignition, but the car won't start. \nSTEVE Damn, they always stick me with the clunker. \nISABELLA Take my van! \nEXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - DAY \nKAT'S EXPEDITION speeds through a yellow light and continues on. \nCLOSE ON EXPEDITION'S LEFT TIRE \nMetal sheers away more rubber. \nINSIDE THE EXPEDITION \nRory, antsy, rubbing his nostrils, stares at two Yankee tickets. \nRORY Here's what I don't get. For nine months, Death does all this shit to make sure I win these tickets and end up on Route 18 at exactly the right time for the pile up... \nKAT Yeah? \nRORY But why single me out? What am I in the great scheme of things? You'd think I stepped off Flight 180 or something... Fucking weird, man. \nTHOMAS You want weird? Last year, my partner and I were heading out for the graveyard shift. A call comes in about a train wreck and Frank decides to let me handle it alone. \n(beat) Frank died that night in a shootout. I'd be dead too if that call had come in just ten seconds later. \nEveryone nods in that 'life's weird' reverence kind of way. \nKAT I got that beat. So like, last May, I was supposed to stay at this cheesy bed and breakfast in Pennsylvania. There was a major gas leak no one knew about and all the guests suffocated during the night. \nRORY Yeah, so what happened? \nKAT I never mad it. The Greyhound bus I was on splattered some chick all over the road and we had to stop. \nCLEAR Was that in Mt. Abraham? \nKAT Yeah.   How did you know? \nCLEAR (sinking realization) That bus you were on? It killed Terry Mathers. She was supposed to die on Flight 180. \nKAT I'm not sure I-- \nTHOMAS Shit. The call about the train wreck that saved my life? That was the night I scraped up Billy Hitchcock. \nRORY Who? \nKIMBERLY Another kid from Flight 180. \nA chill passes over the group. \nINT. WINDING ROADS - DAY \nDeputy Steve speeds the White Van up the narrow winding road. Isabella breathes Lamaze- style through intense pain. \nISABELLA Promise me...I won't have the \nThe wood chipper roar s loudly. Suddenly, some forgotten stray chunk SHOOTS from the spout -- \nThe airborne chunk of WOOD CRACKS the White Van's windshield. Steve veers out of control. \nKat sees the White Van ahead swerving into HER LANE. She quickly jerks the wheel to the right. \nKat's LEFT FRONT TIRE BLOWS! It sends rubber flying and the entire SUV pulls hard to the left, spinning her out of control into the oncoming lane of traffic - toward the White Van! \nIsabella SCREAMS! Steve jerks the wheel to the left! The White Van has a close near miss with the Expedition, and goes off the road toward a LAKE! \nSTEVE Hang on! \nThe SUV misses the tractor -- but sails off the other side of the embankment, spinning and rolling towards -- \nTHE GIBBONS' FARM \nAt the bottom of the hill of a large rural farm, a PROPANE TANK sits at the edge of the property! \nThe SUV barrels down the hill - coming right for it! \nINSIDE THE SUV \nAll Kat can do is cover her head with her arms. \nTHE WHITE VAN \nSpeeding toward the lake! Isabella SCREAMS, in pain, not fear. The White Van is ready for splashdown. \nSteve finesses the hand brake while tapping the accelerator. He's able to right the van away from the water without so much as a hard jerk. \nSTEVE We're okay, we're okay. \nTHE PROPANE TANK \nIt's about to get creamed - but the bouncing Expedition just barely misses it! It continues, backwards, CRASHING through a temporary fence and right into -- \nAN AGRICULTURAL CONSTRUCTION SITE! \nThe Expedition plows past earth movers, crashing through irrigation ditches and pipes, shrapnel flying everywhere. \nJust as the Expedition comes to a stop, an IRRIGATION PIPE ROCKETS through the rear window -- miraculously missing Clear and Rory -- coming to a rest just behind Kat's head. \nINSIDE THE WHITE VAN \nSteve sees the wreckage on the other side of the highway and slows down. Isabella squeezes his hand white. \nISABELLA Please.   It's not going to wait. \nSTEVE I've got to stop and help those people. \nISABELLA Do you want to deliver this baby? \nSteve looks ill, then sees another car stopping by the crash. He floors it and speaks into the shoulder mic of his cop radio. \nTHE EXPEDITION \nThe dust settles in the silent car. The only sound is a QUIET, WET WHEEZE. Clear, dazed, looks around carefully, avoiding the METAL SPIKE that skewers the vehicle. \nRory holds his trembling hand before his eyes as if amazed to see it. Kimberly shakes her hair, spilling glass onto the floor. Kat tries to open the door, but it won't budge. \nKAT Not my time.     Amazing... \nTHOMAS Is everybody alright? \nA BLOODY HAND SEIZES HIS SHOULDER! \nThomas turns to see \nEugene SPASMING in the back seat! He clutches his ribcage in agony and wheezes! Blood trickles from his mouth. \nKAT He can't breathe!        He can't breathe! \nCLEAR Oh my god, Eugene!? \nEugene's head tilts forward, unconscious. \nEXT. GIBBONS' FARM - DAY \nBRIAN GIBBONS jumps off the tractor and sprints down the hill toward the accident. At the edge of the property is a common farm FENCE made from wooden posts bridged by two thick wires. \nBrian skillfully climbs between the wires and runs past a DEAD OAK TREE ten feet inside the fence. In the BG, MR. GIBBONS darts inside a double-wide construction trailer. \nMR. GIBBONS (O.S.) Call 9- 1-1! \nWE FOLLOW BRIAN \nRory cringes at his name, pockets his stash, then EXITS FRAME. WE PUSH IN, the news van gas tank is leaking. A SMALL DRIP... \nEXT. GIBBON'S FARM - CONTINUOUS \nThomas, Kimberly, Clear and Rory watch the JAWS OF LIFE being clamped onto Kat's door. \nTHOMAS Where's the cell phone Clear gave you? \nRORY I dunno. I think I gave it to Eugene back at your place. \nTHOMAS Damn it. We have to call the Greenwood Police Station and warn Isabella. \nThomas runs in the direction of some local POLICE. After he leaves, Rory drifts away from the pack, hand in pocket. \nKimberly moves back to Kat, who chain -smokes in the front seat of the Expedition. \nKIMBERLY You doing alright in there? \nKAT My legs are starting to cramp up. And God, why am I so thirsty? Does anyone have any Fiji? \nThe KA-CHUNK of the Jaws of Life next to Kat startles her half to death. \nKAT Christ, you wanna give me a heads up next time, pal? \nBrian and Mr. Gibbons approach with a cup of tap water. They hand it to kat, who frowns but drinks anyway. \nCUT TO: \nTHE DRIP \nOf the leaking gas becomes a steady trickle. GAS SLITHERS over packed dirt, around debris, toward the crash site. \nBACK TO: \nTHOMAS DARK ROOM \nSpeaks to another COP who clicks off his radio. \nCOP She's at Phelps Memorial. They're prepping her to give birth right now. \nTHOMAS Where's that? \nCOP A few miles up the road.   Near the docks. \nKAT \nLights one cigarette off the other KA -CHUCNK! The sound makes her flinch, dropping the cigarette on the floor. \nKAT Damn, can't you be quieter with that thing? \nRESCUE WORKER (dripping scorn) Sure, I'll just set it to the \"quiet\" mode. \nKat rescues the glowing cigarette from around her feet and inhales. KA-CHUNK!!! She jumps again, but maintains her composure. \nMEANWHILE \nThe gasoline purposefully trickles down corrugated steel, through pipes, closer and closer to the Expedition. At one point, the gas even disappears into a hole in the ground, only to resurface twenty feet closer to the site... \nKIMBERLY \nLooks confused to watch Rory climb between the fence wires and drift the Dead Oak Tree into the field. Thomas runs down the hill toward Kimberly. \nTHOMAS We gotta go now.   Isabella's in labor. \nRescue Workers pull off a large chunk of door. KA-CHUNK! Kat Flinches. \nKIMBERLY What about that? \nCLEAR (calls over to Kat) How you doing in there, hero? \nKAT (re: spike behind head) I guess it could be worse. \nBrian hands out drinks to Rescue Workers. \nTHOMAS So let's go...Where the hell is Rory?! \nThomas sees Rory in the field and angrily hops the fence, heading directly under the dead Oak Tree. \nRory, his back to everyone, finally opens the BINDLE. Enraptured, he delicately unfolds it... \nKIMBERLY \nIs put on alert by a fresh BREEZE. Her attention is caught by the WINDOW of an emergency vehicle. IN THE REFLECTION, Kimberly sees a man sitting on the Expedition, but when she spins ar ound, there's no one there. \nKA-CHUNG! The door comes off the Expedition, finally freeing Kat! Everyone applauds! \nThe Nurse SNEEZES. \nANESTHESIOLOGIST Goddamn it, keep her still! \nNURSE Sorry, doctor. \nXCU NEEDLE \nTracing skin between Isabella's constantly moving vertebra. \nANGLE ON BUMBLEBEE \nIt buzzes about the room, darting between the he ads of the doctors and nurses, hovering above the -- \nANESTHESIOLOGIST, who traces the long needle down Isabella's spine, finding the proper vertebrae. \nANESTHESIOLOGIST Perfectly still now... \nEveryone freezes. SILENCE. As the tip of the needle presses the skin down -- \nThe BEE lands on the Anesthesiologist's ear. And STINGS! \nFLINCH! \nThe NEEDLE SINKS IN - a NURSE GASPS. Did something go wrong? \nANESTHESIOLOGIST Done. (tears welling) Now could someone please find the open window and fucking close it? \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - CONTINUOUS \nKimberly speeds the truck down some dangerously twisty roads slick from wet leaves. \nKIMBERLY This makes no sense. Isabella was supposed to crash her van into a lake. Could we have altered her destiny when we had her arrested? \nCLEAR I don't think so. Alex's premonitions happened exactly as he saw them no matter how much we \ntried to change it. \nTHOMAS Then the only way to survive is to get to the hospital and protect Eugene and Isabella for as long as we can. \nCLEAR If only Alex and I had done that with the others, Alex might still be... \nA somber beat. Then Thomas looks over at the speedometer. \nTHOMAS Um, Kimberly? This is a neighborhood. You may wanna slow it down. \nKIMBERLY Don't worry. Nothing can happen to us. \nTHOMAS I wasn't worried about us. \nSuddenly, Kimberly clutches her throat! \nHARD CUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nUNKNOWN POV \nA NURSE hovers over us in a hospital, WRESTLING us down by the look of things. There is SCREAMING all around. The image comes at us so fast, we see only the briefest glimpse of the NAMETAG on her uniform: \nKALARJIAN \nTHOMAS (O.S.) Kimberly! Slow down! \nBACK TO: \nINT. TRUCK - CONTINUOUS \nKimberly \"comes to\" at the wheel -- FLAILING DESPERATELY at the steering wheel. She even claws at Thomas who tries to control the neglected steering wheel. \nCLEAR Slow down! We're... \nKimberly looks up as the truck comes around a blind curve, where cars are backed up at a stop sign. Kimberly screams and SLAMS on the brakes. \nThe truck SKIDS on wet leaves, completely out of control, towards a LANDSCAPING TRUCK parked on the shoulder. \nKimberly's truck hits the loading ramps and launches itself twenty feet into the air, DUKES OF HAZZARD-style. \nAnd lands miraculously without a scratch! On a parallel road. And keeps going. Dumb, insane fucking luck. \nKimberly shakes off her premonition and looks out the rear window. She turns around with a cocky smile. \nShe rubs her throat and FLOORS IT again to Thomas' horror, more determined. \nCLEAR (eyes darting) What did you see? What am I looking for? \nORDERLY Need a pen? Sure. If you like, I'll bring crosswords for you, too. \nEugene tries nodding his thanks, but the tube in his throat hampers his movement. \nANCHOR WOMAN (O.S.) ...police Have speculated that one of the deaths may have been \nnarcotics related and urge children to stay away from d rugs. \nFinally, the Orderly pushes the cart away, revealing the TV. An ANCHOR MAN taps his pages on the desktop. \nANCHOR MAN Good advice, Sue. And stay in school. Up next, Johnny Showers has the weather... \nA WEATHERMAN dressed as a frog points out cloud formations. \nEugene, tormented, stares at the screen as the Orderly begins pushing the huge cart out of the room. \nThe sound of a SKIDDING CAR fills the room. It comes from the TV which shows a PSA featuring CRASH TEST DUMMIES. \nORDERLY Jeez, it's freezing in here. \nThe Orderly flicks the thermostat and one by one, VENTS CLOSE just below the ceiling. \nEugene's eyes fill with terror - he knows something's wrong. \nANGLE ON OXYGEN HOSE - \nBursting. It HISSES softly. We follow the OBLIVIOUS ORDERLY out of the room. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nA hospital ADMINISTRATOR briskly strides up to the Orderly. \nADMINISTRATOR What are you doing? The Henzels are still waiting for you in the Children's Ward -- \nThe Orderly smacks his forehead - shit. Totally forgot. \nORDERLY Right, right, right.     Gregory's big day. \nADMINISTRATOR And Mrs. Dempsey in hydrotherapy can't feel her legs. \nThe Orderly, nodding rapidly, is halfway down the hall by now. The Administrator shakes his head in disgust and walks past. \nThe HUGE CART. Which now blocks the door on Eugene's room. \nEXT. PHELPS MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - CONTINUOUS \nKimberly seems to have ditched the cops. She speeds the pick up through the medical facility. \nEXT. EMERGENCY ROOM - DAY \nThe pick up skids to a halt in front of the hospital. Kimberly, Thomas and Clear run outside and into the building. \nINT. PRIVATE ROOM - DAY \nThe OXYGEN HOSE hisses, but is drowned out by the volume of the TV. Eugene's eyes dart frantically as a blaring fast food commercial ends. The n, a NEWS REPORT comes on. The BANNER: \nROUTE 18 TRAGEDY \nFootage showing grieving families, wreaths on doors, yellow ribbons, and emergency crews pulling wreckage apart, dissolve together over: \nANCHOR    WOMAN (O.S.) Mor e tears were    shed this morning in the wake of     yesterday's tragedy that rocked the     Tri -State area... \nSuddenly, the FRAYED ELECTRIC CORD of Eugene's TV begins sparking. The sound DROPS OUT, the picture SPUTTERS. \nEugene goes white with terror. He looks back to -- \nThe broken OXYGEN TUBE. HISSING softly. The BEEPS of the EEG machine frantically increase. Eugene reaches for the nurse call switch. Mockingly out of reach by mere millimeters. \nINT. NURSES STATION - DAY \nClear, Kimberly and Thomas dash toward the main desk. \nCLEAR Isabella Cruz.    What room's she in? \nRECEPTIONIST I'm sorry, I can't give out that info unless you're a relative. \nCLEAR I'm her sister. \nThe Receptionist eyes her dubiously. \nRECEPTIONIST I'll have to see your ID, Ms. Cruz. \nClear vaults over the counter, straight-arms the Receptionist and seizes the computer. Thomas and Kimberly look on, stunned. \nCLEAR Delivery rooms are downstairs. I'll find Eugene and catch up with you. \nNURSE What are you doing in here?    Get the hell out! Right now! \nFinally we hear the BABY CRY! The Nurse immediately moves in to swaddle the newborn. Dr. Kalarjian beams at the very groggy looking Isabella. \nOBSTETRICIAN Isabella, look down and see your son. \nTo the confusion of everyone around them, Kimberly and Thomas BURST INTO CHEERS! They jump, dance and hug each other. \nIt's a magical moment -- \nEXT. EUGENE'S PRIVATE ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe RAT stops gnawing. The TV stops sparking. A wave of intense relief washes over Eugene. He pantomimes reaching into his shirt pocket and lighting a victory cigar. \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - CONTINUOUS \nRelaxed and invigorated, Kimberly and Thomas giddily exit the delivery room as Clear runs up to them. \nCLEAR A guard grabbed me before I could find Eugene. \nTHOMAS Don't sweat it.   It's over. \nCLEAR She had the baby? \nKIMBERLY New life defeats death. We've done it. Death has to rewrite the list. We're safe. \nSteve watches, confused, as Clear whoops with delight and HUGS the others. Clear laughs with a relief that seems completely foreign to her. Kimberly laughs with her, then is suddenly rocked by a vision -- \nHARD CUT TO: \nUNKOWN POV \nLooking up a the EEG machine. Flatlined! \nTHOMAS (O.S.) Kimberly! Are you okay?! \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - BACK TO PRESENT \nKimberly, on the ground, looks frazzled as she SNAPS out of her trance. Thomas helps her to her feet. \nTHOMAS Are you okay? You just face planted! \nKIMBERLY I know how it feels to be dead. \nHer lips blue, Kimberly shivers uncontrollably. Clear sees TWO SECURITY GUARDS round a distant corner and quickly walks the others toward an EMERGENCY LOADING ZONE. \nCLEAR What did you see? \nKIMBERLY I was dead. And came back to life. An EEG machine. Where's Eugene? \nTHOMAS But it's over. Isabella's baby was the key. You saw her die and everything, right? \nKIMBERLY I don't...what if I made a mistake? \nTHOMAS Impossible. She was on the onramp. \nKimberly reluctantly closes her eyes and remembers. \nCUT TO: \nPREVIOUSLY UNSEEN \nMoment of the pile-up premonition. A WHITE VAN in fr ont of Kimberly suddenly slams on its brakes and pulls onto the shoulder. \nKimberly screams, swerving around the van just in time to avoid an accident. \nBACK TO: \nKimberly, overcome with self- doubt. \nKIMBERLY I'm not sure... I don't think Isabella was ever destined to die in the pile -up. \nTHOMAS Then what's the premonition of the lake supposed to mean? \nCLEAR Can you remember anything about it? \nKimberly shuts her eyes, remembering: \nEXT. LAKE - DAY \nPOV DRIVER \nGrease-covered hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE! \nThe van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped. Drowning. Horrible. \nTHOMAS That's crazy. You can't give up now. We can still fight this thing. \nBut Kimberly isn't listening. She stares through the glass doors at the -- \nAMBULANCE \nA red stripe down the side, but the hood is completely white. Six floral scented air-fresheners hang from the rearview. The 'van' from her vision! And it's running! \nKIMBERLY I have to do this. \nKimberly wipes tears from her eyes, kisses Thomas' cheek, then turns and runs before he can speak. \nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS \nKimberly heads right for the open ambulance. The driver's door almost seems to swing open for her as she gets in. \nINT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS \nThomas frantically tries to get through the electric doors, which SPARK and short out. He struggles to pry them apart. \nEXT. HOSPITAL ENTRANCE - CONTINUOUS \nKimberly shifts into gear and speeds off. Thomas squeezes through the doors and runs after her. An EMT, the driver of the stolen ambulance, rushes outside. \nEMT What the fuck?! \nEXT. LAKE - DAY \nThomas chases the ambulance, watching helplessly as it barrels over curbs, pylons and a fence, ultimately plunging straight into the lake! \nThomas sprints to the lake as fast as he can - the EMT trailing far behind. \nINSIDE THE AMBULANCE \nKimberly panics as the ambulance fills with water and she takes a final gasp of air -- \nON THE LAKE'S EDGE \nThomas stares in horror at the percolating air bubbles as the vehicle descends below the surface -- and he dives in! \nUNDERWATER \nThomas swims into the dark, murky water. Deeper and deeper, he g ets to the ambulance and tries to open the door. Stuck. He withdraws his baton and BANGS on the glass - nothing! \nHe tries coming up for air, but his pants snag on the jagged metal of the twisted bumper. He squirms frantically... \nAnd as his exhausted body loses consciousness, everything -- \nFADE TO BLACK. \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY \nBLACKNESS. \nDR. KALARJIAN (O.S.) Ready and...CLEAR! \nThe SHOCK of defribulator paddles brings Kimberly back to life. \nKIMBERLY'S POV \nLooking up at Dr. Kalarjian, all she can see is part of a woman's face and a partial nametage reading \"Kalarjian\". \nIt would appear as if she's choking Kimberly, but -- \nAn EEG MONITOR turns from a flatline to a steady heartbeat, the same POV as the premonition. \nNURSE She's back! \nDR. KALARJIAN Five CC's of narcodon. I want her stabilized and prepped for ICU. \nKimberly turns her head to see \nTHOMAS \nUnconscious, CPR being performed on him by the EMT (who's now soaking wet). Thomas doesn't respond. \nAn INTERN opens an eyelid, points a flashlight at his eyes. Shakes his head, nothing. The sopping wet EMT goes back to performing CPR. \nFinally, Thomas coughs up water, chokes, gasps for air, then BOLTS UPRIGHT. \nTHOMAS Kimberly?! \nHe turns to see Kimberly reaching out for him. Immeasurably relieved, he takes her hand and allows himself to be eased back down to the platform. Kimberly's eyes fill with tears. \nKIMBERLY (whispering) Welcome back. We did it.           For real. \n", "test1_input": "Evan makes one last push with his foot - accidently flipping the SWITCH - the GARBAGE DISPOSAL GRINDS METAL! \nEvan, horrified, miraculously yanks his hand free, brushing against the knife in the toaster. \nWhen the SHOCK goes through Evan's body, his other hand jerks out, knocking the flaming frying pan to the floor. \nThe entire kitchen is in flames, including the new TV blocking the door. The window slams SHUT! The room fills with smoke. \nEVAN Jesus Christ! \nEvan grabs a fire extinguisher. A mere dribble of foam comes out. He begins COUGHING in the smoke. \nEvan tries the window - STUCK! He has no choice but to smash the kitchenette window with the fire extinguisher to get to the fire escape. \nHe dr ops the fire extinguisher, starts to climb out the window, hears a creak and looks up just as -- \nA large jagged shard of glass comes CRASHING down at him -- Evan jumps back just in time as it shatters before him. The fire completely engulfs the kitchen. \nHe bravely jumps through the window pane, landing on the fire escape. He runs down the fire escape from floor to floor. \nA LARGE BLAST from his window showers him with glass and brick shrapnel, but ultimately, he makes it to the fire escape's lowest level, intact. \nHe tries to lower the rusty metal ladder to the ground. It budges once, then twice, but won't go down. So he climbs over the railing and gently drops to the ground. \nSafe and sound, he breathes a sigh of relief and turns to walk -- \nSUDDENLY he s lips on the very grease he threw out the window, his legs shoot out from under him and he lands on his back. \nThe rusty ladder suddenly dislodges and hurls downward -- coming right for Evan's face -- but stops halfway! \nAs Evan laughs, breathing a final sigh of relief, it suddenly PLUMMETS again -- impaling Evan through his eye socket! \nINT. POLICE STATION - COMPUTER ROOM - NIGHT \nThomas sits at the computer terminal. He checks to make sure no one's watching as he enters a SEARCH for Alex Browning. \nTen websites come up, all devoted to the Flight 180 Curse. Thomas scrolls around, seeing the death pix and autopsy photos of Flight 180 \"survivors\". \nHeadlines blare, \"Freak Accident?\" \"Bizarre Coincidence?\" describing the way the victims died. As Thomas begins a localized search of the word, \"PREMONITION\" -- \nSPOOKY HUMMING from behind him. \nThomas whirls around to see Det. Suby looking over his shoulder, humming the music from an old monster movie. Suby presses one hand to his forehead, the other polishing an apple against his vest. \nDETECTIVE SUBY (as if entranced) Ooooh, I see it now. Your future... A transfer to another department. \nSuby bites the apple, casually offering nothing more. Thomas, embarrassed, flicks off the computer, stands. \nTHOMAS You've made your point. \nDETECTIVE SUBY Good. Cause we just got some new info and I don't ne ed you getting freaky on me. \nTHOMAS What? \nDETECTIVE SUBY Evan Shaeffer's dead. Guess he wasn't as lucky as we thought. \nDetective Suby shrugs and walks away, munching the apple. Thomas looks stunned. \nINT. KAT'S ROOM - NIGHT \nKat cradles a phone to her shoulder. She watches television and crushes Oreos into a bowl of ice- cream. \nKAT No, Mom. Just turn on any station, they've been playing it all day. (beat; rolls her eyes) Yes, Mother. Channel four will do just fine. Here it is, gotta go. \nShe hangs up the phone, mesmerized by the report: \nFOOTAGE FROM A HELICOPTER shows the pile up wreckage. \nANCHOR MAN (V.O.) Route 18 was backed up for almost nine hours today when a record breaking pile up... \nINT. NORA'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nNora and Tim watch the same report. \nANCHOR MAN (V.O.) ...killed An estimated 18 people. Emergency crews spent hours sifting through the wreckage. \nINT. EUGENE'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEugene looks up from grading midterm bluebooks to watch. \nANCHOR MAN (V.O.) ...hoping To recover any survivors from this tragic collision. So far, the police are refusing to release the names of the victims until their families are notified. \nINT. KIMBERLY'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nMr. Burroughs numbly watches the same report. He doesn't see Kimberly enter behind him from the kitchen. \n", "test1_true": "B/W CAMERA FOOTAGE from Thomas' car shows Thomas tackling Kimberly to the ground just as a jack -knifed truck plows into the SUV. \nMR. BURROUGHS My Lord... \nA GASP from behind him. Mr. Burroughs spins to see Kimberly fighting back tears and picks up the remote, prepared to click of the TV -- but she stops him. \nKIMBERLY Don't.   I have to see this. \nMr. Burroughs reluctantly keeps the newscast on. \nINT. RORY'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nIt's a party. Rory, surrounded by BUDDIES, shakes a triumphant fist at the television. HE WHOOPS with delight, spilling popcorn everywhere. \nRORY Whoohoo! You see that shit? Right there? That's my fuckin' car right there! Oh God, that's dope. \nAfter high-fiving his peeps, he bends to table level and snorts a freshly chopped line. \nANCHOR MAN (O.S.) In other news, a freak accident took the life of a lotto winner. \nRory looks up to see the DMV photo of Evan. As he takes in the report, his mood radically shifts. He looks like he's been hit by a train. \nMONTAGE \nOf Kimberly, Nora, Tim, Eugene and Kat watching. They all take the news very hard as the FOOTAGE shows Evan's BODY being carried away by EMT workers. Eugene, however, shakes his head sadly but goes back to grading blue books. \nTIM'S BEDROOM - LATER \nTim's eyes are glued to the latest Stephen King novel. Nora peers in. \nNORA Come on, Tim, lights out already. \nTim starts at her voice, then reluctantly puts down the book. \nTIM Mom? \nNORA Yeah? \nTIM You think... You think those guys were b.s.-ing us today or what? \nNora swallows, trying to seem brave. \nNORA Oh, please. Some people just need some serious rewiring, that's all. \nBut neither of them are convinced. \nNORA Get some sleep. \nNora kisses his forehead and leaves the room. After she leaves, Tim opens his nightstand drawer, pulls out a dusty nightlight and plugs it in. \nINT. NORA'S BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER \nNora closes her bedroom door. And locks it. She nervously checks the closet and even lowers the blinds. Finally, she takes out a business card and dials a number. She hangs up, then dials again. \nNORA Officer Burke, please? \nINT. KIMBERLY'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nMr. Burroughs tucks a still-shaken Kimberly into bed. In one of his hands is a nearly empty glass of scotch. \nKIMBERLY It's okay, Dad. I'm not ten anymore. \nMr. Burroughs catches himself being overprotective. \nMR. BURROUGHS I'm sorry. I'm just so happy that you're safe. \nKIMBERLY I love you too, Dad.     Goodnight. \nBut Mr. Burroughs isn't ready to leave. He finishes his drink. \nMR. BURROUGHS You know, after your mother died... \nKimberly tenses, bracing for the worst. \nMR. BURROUGHS There were so many times I didn't think I could last another day. I can't even tell you some of the \nthings I th ought about. \nKIMBERLY I used to have those feelings, too. But that's when I'd think of Mom. Her strength...and courage. And I'd pray that maybe I'd grow up to be as brave as she was. And the bad thoughts would go away. \nMR. BURROUGHS (choking up) I don't know what I'd do if I lost you. \nMr. Burroughs leans over, kisses her forehead and leaves. Just as he's out the door, he braces at the distant sound of a CAR SKIDDING out of control. The ENDLESS SCREECH is nerve shattering. Mr. Burroughs stands frozen, tensing for the inevitable crunch. But there is none. And he leaves. \n", "test2_input": "THOMAS I tried calling last night but your father -- \nKIMBERLY Evan Shaeffer's dead. \nThoma s nods and leans against the large glass windows that reflect the sky behind them. \nTHOMAS I know. I've gotten calls all morning from everyone who was on the onramp. We're all meeting at my apartment tonight. \nKIMBERLY Then you believe all this?? That Death is working off a list? \nThomas hesitates before answering. \nTHOMAS I didn't. Until I was dispatched to clean up one of the Flight 180 survivors. \nKIMBERLY Clean up? I don't... \nSuddenly through the reflection of the window glass, Kimberly sees hundreds of pigeons dive bomb her at once! \nLike a scene out of THE BIRDS, Kimberly must duck and cover as the pigeons assault her from every angle. \nBut when Kimberly turns away from the reflection, toward the actual pigeons, THEY'RE GONE. ALL IN HER HEAD. \nKI MBERLY Did you see that?? \nThomas, concerned for her, saw nothing. \nKIMBERLY Pigeons... It's a sign! If Clear's right about the order, then Nora and Tim are going to be attacke d by Pigeons! \nTHOMAS I'm not following you -- \nKIMBERLY They're next on the list.   We have to find them. \nEXT. MEDICAL COMPLEX - DAY \nANGLE ON \nWoman's N ike shoe on a down-moving escalator. Reveal Nora taking her son Tim to a dentist's office. The SHOELACE snags on a bolt of one of the steel side panels, untying it... \nTIM (mischievous smile) You think the tooth fairy's gonna come tonight? I'm thinkin' like fifteen bucks. \nNORA Nice try, kiddo. \nTim smiles, then winces from the pain in his mouth. \nTHE DANGLING SHOELACE heads straight for the escalator grate. IT GETS SWALLOWED UP. As Tim steps off, Nora TRIPS forward. Her caught sneaker is pulled tighter into the innards of the metal staircase. \nTIM Mom! \nTim watches helplessly as Nora reaches down, tug ging at her sneaker, fear mounting. Tim also grabs her sneaker and yanks. Finally, the shoelace SNAPS, and Nora's free again. \nTIM You okay? \nNora puts on a brave face and begins tying one long shoelace to the stubby one. \nNORA Sure hon. I'm fine.   Let's shake it, we're late. \nTim nods. The wind picks up as they continue past a -- \nCONSTRUCTION CREW \nWho apply industrial suction cups to large, thick sheets of PLATED GLASS . \nTim stares in childlike fascination as they pass JACKHAMMERS, a CEMENT MIXER, and an EXCAVATOR. \nINT. CLEAR'S PADDED ROOM - DAY \nClear Rivers applies fun- tack to the back of a newspaper article and sticks it on the wall devoted to Flight 180. \nREVEAL \nA photo of Eva, \"Lotto Winner Killed By Ladder\". \nClear backs away, pausing to look at a group photo of the Survivors of Flight 180 just before take off. Smiling faces. \nTIM Not so much. \nDr. Lees keeps a skeptical smile to himself. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nThe RECEPTIONIST appears next to the fallen fish food with a VACUUM. She plugs it in an outlet below the fishtank. \nA startling GRIND as the vacuum turns on and coughs up a nail. She vacuums up the fish food around Nora's feet. \nThe DEAD FISH gets sucked into the water filter in the fishtank which sputters and stops. The water level RISES, spilling water over the side of the tank. The water TRICKLES closer to the outlet. \n", "test2_true": "Thomas drives his car into a friendly neighborhood. Kimberly, riding shotgun, hangs up her cell phone. \nKIMBERLY Turn around. The cleaning woman said they're at the dentist's. 14th and Main. \nTHOMAS Hold on. \nThomas expertly skids into a U-turn. \nINT. DENTIST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nTim looks petrified as Dr. Lees unveils a tray full of PICS, CARVERS and EXTRACTING FORCEPS. \nThe KA-CHUNG of construction outside makes it im possible to concentrate, but, hands trembling slightly, Dr. Lees picks up a pic and mirror and starts examining Tim's mouth. CU of PIC gently prodding Tim's teeth. \nDR. LEES (O.S.) I'm a little disappointed, Tim. Does your mom know you've been smoking? \nTim groans \"uh-uh\", then suddenly flinches. \nDR. LEES (O.S.) Yeah, that'll have to be filled. \nA BANG from the window startles Dr. Lees. His HAND JERKS, but luckily the pic was removed from Tim's mouth. \nDr. Lees whips around in time to see a PIGEON flutter away from the window. \nDR. LEES Jesus. Every day at the same damn time. Now this'll only sting for a moment. \nDr. Lees picks up a large SYRINGE and moves it toward Tim's open mouth. \nDR. LEES Open big. Wiiiiider... \nTim's eyes radiate fear. The MOUTH OPENS. Reluctantly. Tim nervously eyes the window as the needle enters... \nANGLE ON \nNEEDLE heading toward his gumline -- \nBANG! Another pigeon takes a header into the reflection. Dr. Lees' hand jerks, nearly jabbing Tim's tongue. Tim squirms violently. Dr. Lees looks towards the window angrily. \nDR. LEES How the hell do they expect me to... Would you rather have the laughing gas? \nTim nods his head ferociously. \nDR. LEES Jean?     I need you in here. (waits) Jean??! \nINT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJean continues vacuuming. The vacuum makes contact with Nora's foot. \nINT. DENTIST OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nAfter a minute, Dr. Lees angrily switches on two compressors: Oxygen and Nitrous Oxide. \nBy now, the NO mask has been attached around Tim's nose. As Tim drifts off, Dr. Lees lowers a DRILL into his mouth. \nDR. LEES Open big. Wiiiiiider. \nExcruciating SOUNDS of the drill going through enamel. \nINTERCUT KIMBERLY AND THOMAS \nRacing to the medical complex throughout. \nTHE WAITING ROOM \nThe WATER TRICKLES into the outlet. The vacuum sparks and dies just as -- \nBACK IN DR. LEES' OFFICE \nBANG! SFX: BROKEN GLASS - it sounds like a pigeon finally crashed through the window. In the other room. \nDR. LEES Goddamn it already. \nDr. Lees marches out of the room to investigate. Another quick electrical surge and the OXYGEN COMPRESSOR flutters off. The needle drops. But the NITROUS flow remains strong. \nANGLE ON FISH MOBILE \nSpinning from a new breeze. Suddenly, a small round PUFFER FISH FALLS directly into Tim's mouth. \nSoft, gurgling and choking. \nINT. WAITING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nNora stares at a pigeon with a broken wing frantically trying to fly right. Dr. Lees makes a half- hearted attempt to soothe and catch it. \n", "test3_input": "MORTICIAN But be warned. To disrupt the grand design is to unravel the tapestry of the universe. When you pull all the threads apart, you may find yourself hanging from them. \nThe Mortician finally lets Kimberly go. \nCLEAR One last question. Why is Death working backwards this time? \nThe Mortician glances at his watch - Evan's bran d new Rolex. \nMORTICIAN (shakes head; a sick smile) Sorry, time's up. \nEXT. GAS STATION - DAY \nCLOSE UP - GAS DRIPPING \nFrom the nozzle in Thomas' car. Thomas fills the tank, watching for signs of danger. Clear's hand is poised over the gas pumps' EMERGENCY CUT-OFF VALVE \nSome SKATE RATS exit the mini -mart with a pack of Camels, followed by Kimberly, who carries a couple of Red Bulls and hands them out. \nTHOMAS New life defeats death? Follow the signs? Where the hell did you find that guy? \nKIMBERLY Yeah, I thought he was supposed to be helpful. \nCLEAR He was. If we can use your ability to see the signs, we can cheat Death long enough to figure out what \"new life\" means. (off their looks) I know, it worries me that I \nunderstand him. \nThomas tops off the tank. Some gas spills to the ground. Quick looks all around -- sure enough, one of the Skate Rats is about to strike a match. \nCLEAR'S HAND SLAPS the kid in the back of the head, stopping him mid - motion. \nCLEAR What the fuck are you thinking? \nThe startled Skate Rat shrinks back from Clear's rage. \nSKATE RAT I'm thinkin', suck my junk, bee yatch. \nThomas chuckles to himself and looks at Kimberly who -- \nSMASH CUT TO: \nEXT. LAKE - DAY \nPOV DRIVER. Grease-covered female hands reach out toward a steering wheel of a white van speeding out of control TOWARD A LAKE! \nThe van crashes through a railing and PLUNGES into the water. In moments, the van fills with water, the driver inside trapped. Drowning. Horrible. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. GAS STATION - DAY \nKIMBERLY \nComes to Thomas' arms - GASPING uncontrollably for breath. Terror- stricken. She begins hyperventilating. \nTHOMAS What is it? What did you see? \nIt's so bad, Kimberly can't speak. She coughs and gags as if recently drowned. Clear scans the perimeter for immediate dangers. \nQUICK CUTS: \nA POWER REPAIRMAN \nOn a cherry picker messes with the transformer, a LAWN BOY pull- starts a WEED WHACKER close to broken glass, a MECHANIC on a tall ladder changes out the gas price numbers, a female DOG WALKER with three dogs approaches the ladder. \nCLEAR \nYou have to tell us now. \nKIMBERLY I...I... \nClear shakes her head by the shoulders and barks commands like an angry drill sergeant. \nCLEAR You're strong. Do you hear me? You're a fucking warrior. Nothing scares you. In fact you happen to be the single most powerful woman on earth. Now what did you see? \nThe words slowly take affect. Kimberly becomes centered, getting her breath back, and speaks without a hitch. \nKIMBERLY I was driving a white van. It must've gone out of control because it crashed into a lake and I drowned. It was...horrible. \nCLEAR You were there? \nKIMBERLY I can practically taste the water in my throat. And something else. The smell of flowers... \nCLEAR (confused) Then it wasn't just a sign. It was a premonition? \nThomas gently releases her, paces. \n", "test3_true": "CLEAR Holy shit. He said \"only new life can defeat death.\" (off looks) If she gives birth to a baby that was never meant to be born, a brand new soul that was never part of Death's Design... \nKIMBERLY It throws the entire Death list out of whack. And a new list has to be rewritten f rom scratch. We all start over with a clean slate. \nTHOMAS It sounds all well and good, but \nwhat if we're wrong? \nCLEAR Please, what else could it mean? \nKIMBERLY (to Thomas) So if you give us the pregnant lady's number, we can warn her about the lake and she'll live long enough to have the baby. \nCLEAR So let's do it. \nTHOMAS (realization) Shit, I don't have her number. She was never interviewed. She took off right after the accident. \nKIMBERLY How are we going to find her? There must be thousands of white vans in this state. \nTHOMAS Hey, I'm a police officer, remember? \nINT. A/V ROOM - POLICE STATION - LATER \nThomas works a VCR, scanning BACKWARDS through the video footage from the patrol car camera. We see the SUV's explosive collision with the jack- knifed semi. Kimberly is taken by surprise by the sight of the crash. \nKIMBERLY Oh God... \nThomas sees Kimberly and quickly flicks off the monitor. \nTHOMAS I, uh...sorry. \nKimberly notices Clear watching her and toughens up. She forces back the tears and qui ckly wipes the rest away. \nKIMBERLY I know, I know. We need my eyes. \nClear sits beside Kimberly. \nCLEAR It's all right.    I'll take watch. \nKimberly looks grateful, and a moment passes between them, but she's already buried the need to cry. \nKIMBERLY I'm okay. Just caught me by surprise. Put it back on. \nClear does, watching the cars seemingly pass in reverse. \nCLEAR Make sure all these people will be at the meeting tonight. \nTHOMAS Taken care of. \nTHE MONITOR \nBack, back, back until the Patrol Car slowly creeps backwards down the onramp. \nKIMBERLY There it is. \nTHOMAS Got it. \nThomas hits play and we see footage from the patrol car cruising past the White Van. A clean shot of the license plate. Jackpot. \nAs Thomas slides his chair to a data base and types in the plate number, the pause function dislodges, slowly advancing the tape frame by frame. \nCLEAR I don't get it. Why is everything happening so fast? After Flight 180. A month went by before anyone died. And now five people are dead in less than a day. \nThomas' computer screen finally fills with information. \nTHOMAS Here we go. The vehicle's a delivery van registered to Jorge and Isabella Cruz. And Christ, there's almost a dozen domestic disturbance complaints on these two. \nCLEAR We need to hurry. \nThey all get up and leave. \nOminously, THE MONITOR shows the NEXT VEHICLE creeping behind Nora's Pacer - a white van! \nINT. CRUZ HOUSE - NIGHT \nThomas pulls up to an upper-middle class house. Thomas, Kimberly and Clear get out and start up the unlit path. It's dark, hard to see where they're going, so they negotiate by feeling the bushes aligning the walkway. \nTHOMAS Let's lay this on her gently now. The stress alone could upset the pregnancy. \nKimberly nods, ever creeping closer to the front door -- when AUTOMATIC LIGHTS FLASH from over the garage. \nAll three freeze for a moment, during which we hear STOMPING emanate from within the house, and the lights SHUT OFF. \nBut nothing else happens. No one comes to a door. Thomas sighs, and as if suddenly remembering his status, he walks fearlessly and purposefully to the front door. \n"}

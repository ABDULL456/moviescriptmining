INT. BAR LOUNGE - HOUSTON HILTON - LATER THAT EVENING 
Empty glasses litter the table. Ryan and Alex have taken over a couch and have the contents of their wallets spread out - All MEMBERSHIP CARDS. 
RYAN (grabs one of Alex's cards) Maplewood Card? How dare you bring that into this palace. 
ALEX Hilton offers equal value and better food - But the Maplewood gives out warm cookies at check in. 
RYAN They got you with the cookies? 
ALEX I'm a sucker for simulated hospitality. 
RYAN There's actually an industry term for that. It's a mixture of faux and homey. It's faumey. 
Alex grabs Ryan's AMERICAN CONCIERGE KEY CARD. 
ALEX Oh my God. I've heard about these, but never seen one in person. Is this a...? 
RYAN Concierge Key. Yeah. 
ALEX I love the weight. 
RYAN Graphite. I was pretty excited the day that puppy came in. 
ALEX I'll say. I put up pretty pedestrian numbers. Sixty thou a year, domestic. 
RYAN (TRYING) That's not bad. 
ALEX Don't patronize me. What's your total? 
RYAN That's a personal question. 
ALEX Oh please... 
RYAN (PLAYFUL) I hardly know you. 
ALEX Show some hubris. Impress me. (SUGGESTIVE) I bet it's huge. 
RYAN You have no idea. 
ALEX Come on... (holds her hands eight INCHES APART) Is it this big? (extends a few inches) ... this big? 
RYAN Let's just say I've got a number in mind and I haven't hit it yet. 
Alex smiles, fair enough. Admires the CONCIERGE KEY CARD. 
ALEX This is pretty fucking sexy. 
RYAN I hope it doesn't cheapen our relationship. 
ALEX We're two people who get turned on by elite status. We may have to settle for cheap. 
RYAN There's nothing cheap about loyalty. 
Alex looks into Ryan's eyes and gives him unspoken permission to take her right there and then. 
INT. HOTEL HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Ryan and Alex walk down a curved corridor, suppressing laughter. There's no adult way to go back to somebody's hotel room. Once at the door, Ryan tries his KEY CARD, but it doesn't work. 
He reaches into his pocket and comes up with five other key cards from recent trips. 
RYAN I really have to start throwing these out. 
He tries a couple. 
ALEX We can always use that room with the ice machine. 
Ryan chuckles. He finds the right key and opens the door. 
INT. RYAN'S SUITE, HOUSTON HILTON - LATER THAT NIGHT 
Everything is scattered from a marathon Fuck. Ryan and Alex are laying on the bed, sprawled out on their backs like murder victims. 
RYAN Good call on the towel rack. 
ALEX Thanks. I liked how you burritoed me in the sofa cushions. 
RYAN I was improvising. 
ALEX Too bad we didn't make it to the closet. 
RYAN We got to do this again.

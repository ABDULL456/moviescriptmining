They start to go at it again - at first slowly and tenderly - then wildly.  Alice tears herself away and looks up at Pete. 
ALICE (CON'T) Are you my man? 
PETE (getting hotter) Yes. 
ALICE Are you gonna be a man about this, Pete? 
Pete looks at her - starting to understand what she means. 
ALICE (CON'T) Are you? 
Pete stares at her - then nods. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. DAYTON HOUSE - NIGHT 
Pete drives up and parks his Camaro in the driveway.  When he gets out of the car, he sees Sheila standing by the front step.  She is looking in his direction, but doesn't seem to see him.  She SUDDENLY turns and looks up the street - she YELLS. 
SHEILA (total horror) THERE'S SOMEONE WITH HIM!! 
As she yells, she starts to look around wildly - then her eyes follow the path the Camaro took into the driveway - then the path Pete took to where he has been standing all this time.  Her eyes find Pete and she stands by the front step. 
PETE (frightened) Sheila? 
She heads toward him. 
PETE Sheila, what is it?... What are you doin' here? 
SHEILA You've been fucking somebody else haven't you? 
PETE Sheila... 
SHEILA You fuck me whenever you want... You don't call... Tell me who she is. 
Sheila has come up and is grabbing Pete by the front of his shirt. 
PETE Hey... Sheila. 
SHEILA What's the BITCH'S name?! 
PETE Look Sheila... I'm sorry... 
SHEILA YOU'RE SORRY!! 
PETE Go home, Sheila. 
Sheila starts beating him in the face and chest. 
SHEILA YOU'RE SORRY!! YOU PIECE OF SHIT!! YOU'RE SORRY!! 
She starts crying and hitting him harder. 
SHEILA (CON'T) FUCK YOU!! 
Sheila's screaming is reverberating around the neighborhood. INSIDE PETE'S MIND the SOUNDS are even LOUDER. 
Bill comes out of the house.  Claire is behind him waiting on the front porch. 
Sheila beats Pete and trips him to the ground.  She is sobbing as she tears at him. 
PETE Sheila... Stop... 
SHEILA FUCK YOU!! FUCK YOU!! 
Bill comes up to Sheila and takes her gently by the shoulders. 
Sheila jerks around and looks up at Bill. 
BILL Why don't you two come inside and talk things over quietly... Come on... Come on in, Sheila. 
Sheila gets to her feet - crying.  She looks down at Pete, who remains lying on the front lawn. 
For Pete, every word and every sound is LOUD and DISTORTED. The DRONING SOUND returns. 
SHEILA (to Pete) You are different. 
BILL Sheila... 
SHEILA (to Bill) TELL HIM! 
The phone inside the house starts to ring.  Claire turns in the doorway and goes to answer it. 
BILL Sheila... Don't. 
SHEILA I don't care anyway... I'm sorry, Mr. Dayton... I won't bother you or any member of your family again. 
Sheila runs off crying.  Pete and Bill watch her go. 
Claire comes to the door.

LAP DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
We now find the Draytons and the McKennas are  sitting in a group, eating dinner together. There is   no back to back awkwardness. All  are busily tearing  whole roast chickens apart with their bare fingers.   Drayton holds a piece of chicken aloft, demonstrating  the proper Arab method of eating. 
DRAYTON Only the first two fingers and thumb of the right hand. Never use the smaller fingers. And always keep the left hand in the lap. 
JO Does it have something to do with religion? 
DRAYTON More social than religious, I'd say.

BEN It seems to me if you have four good fingers, and a thumb, you should use them all. 
J0 Three finger -- four fingers -- for my money this is nothing but chicken in the rough. We have it at every drive- in back home. 
DRAYTON Well, as I was saying, I was quite happy farming my bit of land It Buckinghamshire, when these chaps from the United Nations started worrying me. 
MRS. DRAYTON Edward was a big noise at the Ministry of Food during the war, you know. 
DRAYTON So, I pulled myself up by the roots, and here we are. United Nations Relief. 
BEN That sounds like interesting work. 
DRAYTON You should see my report on soil erosion in Morocco... (Sadly) But nobody reads it. 
Jo is staring at the entrance to the restaurant. Mrs. Drayton follows her glance. The two men stop talking, and eating, and also look. 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. LONG SHOT 
Louis Bernard is standing in the entrance of the restaurant. On his arm is a rather elegantly dressed woman. She is also handsome and graceful. As he stands waiting for the headwaiter, Louis Bernard looks around the restaurant. His eyes stop when he comes to the McKennas. He looks directly at them without the slightest sign of recognition. 
LOUIS Trouvez nous un coin tranquille -- C'est possible? (Could you show me a quiet place?) 
WAITER Certainment, monsieur.   (Certainly, Sir)

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - CLOSE SHOT 
Jo and Ben stare back. There is resentment in Jo's eyes, and conjecture in Ben's. 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. SHOT 
The headwaiter comes up to Louis Bernard, exchanges a few words with him which we cannot hear, and then leads the couple to a set of cushions in the far corner of the room. As he moves away from the entrance, Louis Bernard does not look at the McKennas. 
INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
As the couple traverses the restaurant, our four diners watch them -- the Draytons out of idle curiosity, but the McKennas with growing astonishment as they realize that Bernard has no intention of recognizing them, or speaking to them. Jo turns back to Ben. 
JO Well just what do you think of that? First he promises to take us to dinner -- 
BEN Look, we only met him today. We can't expect him to change his whole life -- 
JO Oh, Ben!   What's the matter with you?! 
BEN Nothing!   What's the matter with you?! 
JO I just don't like to be both privately and publicly insulted. 
BEN Can you blame him? Turning down an old married couple for a date with a girl like that? 
JO We're not an old married couple! All right -- He's a heel. I don't understand him -- and I'm beginning not to like what he's doing to our whole night. 
Drayton, quietly amused, is listening to Ben and Jo. But Mrs. Drayton is embarrassed. She makes conversation at random.

MRS. DRAYTON (To Drayton) I must do some shopping in the market tomorrow. I do hope it'll be fine. Fine, but not too fine. Of course, I how our English weather is awful, but I sometimes think we don't know when we're lucky. All this sunshine, day after day. It seems unnatural, somehow. 
Ben makes as if to rise, but Jo holds him down. 
BEN I want to get up. 
JO Ben, I know you -- once you get worked up, you'll start a fight. Now please, sit down and forget him. 
DRAYTON (To the McKennas) By the way, it'd be pleasant if you'd let us show you round the market place, tomorrow. 
JO Louis Bernard, the big buyer from Paris, was going to take us through the market tomorrow. 
BEN (Starts to rise aaain) Good. I'll just go over and cancel out. 
She pushes him down again. 
JO Ben, don't. Our dinner's getting cold. (To the Draytons) We'd love to go with you. 
Ben glares in Bernard's direction, and then picks up a chicken leg. 
JO I don't know why Ben gets so worked up over unimportant things. 
Ben looks a her slowly, and with some amazement. Then his eyes lift a little and he sees the headwaiter standing nearby gesturing to him to please use only three fingers. Ben looks down at the chicken leg. He is holding it gripped in his fist. This is too much. He throws the leg down to his plate in disgust.

INT. ARAB RESTAURANT - (NIGHT) - MED. CLOSE SHOT 
Over in the far corner of the restaurant, the lady with Louis Bernard leans forward and murmurs something in French. Her gaze is across the room in the direction of the McKennas. 
WOMAN C'est les deux que cherchez? (Is that the couple you are looking for?) 
Louis turns slightly and looks.     He glances back at her and nods significantly. 
LOUIS Oui.   (Yes.) 
FADE OUT. 
FADE IN: 
EXT. MARKET PLACE - (DAY) - ESTABLISHING SHOT 
It is around eleven o'clock in the morning in the    main market square at Marrakesh. This is usually the     busy time of the day. There are coaches arriving from     the countryside with the Arab farmers alighting with    their baggage, veiled women getting off the coaches and    going into the markets.

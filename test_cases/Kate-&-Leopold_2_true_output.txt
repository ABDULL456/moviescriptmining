CHARLIE Since you're such an expert on fine cuisine, why don't you make dinner tomorrow night? 
LEOPOLD It should be obvious to you that I am NOT a domestic. You may take my plate. 
CHARLIE I have my own, thank you. 
KATE Charlie... 
CHARLIE Who died and made me Cinderella? 
LEOPOLD Young man, there is a distinct impertinence to your voice. 
CHARLIE It's part of my charm. 
LEOPOLD Suppress it. 
KATE (changing the subject) Leopold... Since you're our guest here, there are several cultural events you might enjoy seeing. Charlie has season tickets to the ball game. Perhaps you'd like to take that in? 
LEOPOLD What is it? 
CHARLIE What is it?? 
KATE Or the Opera or the Ballet? 
CHARLIE What is it?? 
KATE Charlie, there's no rule that says everyone has to be interested in baseball. 
CHARLIE No, but I believe there is a rule that says everyone has to have HEARD of it. 
LEOPOLD Dr. Coles, your brother Charles attitude and demeanor are unacceptable. If I am to stay on here you must have a serious talk with him regarding respect and civility. 
KATE CHARLES, could you help me with the dessert in the kitchen? 
CHARLIE In the kitchen? 
KATE IN the kitchen. Excuse us. 
Kate and Charlie leave. The camera remains on Leopold, sitting alone, calmly sipping his wine. VOICE OVER FROM THE KITCHEN: 
CHARLIE I don't believe this guy! 
KATE Try to be nice to him. 
CHARLIE I'm always NICE! 
KATE Please Charlie, as a favor to me. 
CHARLIE He gives me the creeps. 
Leopold reacts. He listens self-consciously. 
KATE He's different that's all. 
CHARLIE What was that crack about domestics? 
KATE Charlie, this is important to me. 
CHARLIE You're not going out with him, are you? 
KATE Eeuuu! I may be desperate but I'm not a lost cause. 
CHARLIE Kate, this is me. I've seen the guys you bring home. 
KATE I've done countless favors for you! Now I'm asking for just one little thing... 
CHARLIE (overlapping) Oh, all right! All right! All right! 
They emerge from the kitchen, beaming. 
KATE (after a beat) We forgot the dessert. 
CHARLIE You know,... I don't know if I mentioned it... but that is one fine looking suit. 
INT. KATE'S BEDROOM - 6:30 A. M. 
Radio alarm clock -- 7:45 a.m. Louis Armstrong begins to sing, "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off." Dressed in yoga clothes Kate sits on her bed in the lotus position. She bangs the gong and closes her eyes. A bell rings. Kate flinches but does not open her eyes. 
KATE (too sweetly) What is it, Leopold? 
The bell rings louder, interrupting Kate's routine.

JENNY (O.S.) Stop it!!! Stop it!!! 
She barges into the fray and starts peeling the men away from the STAR MAN. 
JENNY Get away from him!! Leave him alone!! You stupid jerks!! He's retarded!! Can't you see that?!! Get away from him!! 
The men do. Jenny pushes the sleeve of the torn wind-breaker back up on the STAR MAN's shoulder. 
MOTHER He was stealing my baby... 
JENNY You're wrong!! He would never do anything like that!! (takes STAR MAN's hand) Let's go... 
MOTHER He had Gloria in his hands! 
JENNY He's retarded! I shouldn't have left him alone! 
She starts to push out of the circle. Burt steps in to block her. 
JENNY (hisses) Get out of my way. 
She stares at him until he does, then leads the STAR MAN down the path that opens for them in the crowd. They pass a MALL GUARD who has just arrived. 
EXT. STREET - SIOUX FALLS - DAY 
JENNY Are you okay? 
Still shaken, the STAR MAN nods. Jenny realizes that it is comforting to him to have his hand in hers and she leads him like a child down the sidewalk to the Mustang. 
STAR MAN (as Jenny puts him in the passenger seat) Thank you. 
The Mall Guard follows them down the walk-way and watches them drive off. He scribbles the license number in his notebook. 
INT. GREYHOUND BUS STATION - SIOUX FALLS - DAY 
At the counter Jenny puts her Visa card back into her wallet while the CLERK staples the pages of a ticket into a travel folder. 
CLERK (handing it to her) Gate three. It's boarding now. 
JENNY Thank you. 
CLERK Have a nice trip. 
We FOLLOW Jenny THROUGH the people milling around the benches in the waiting area TO the STAR MAN seated in an open-faced coffee shop. He is watching a MOTHER feed her baby in the booth across from him. A map of the United States is spread out on the formica. Jenny plunks herself down catty-cornered from him. The tear in his sleeve has been closed with safety pins. 
JENNY The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells... 
STAR MAN (pointing to baby) Is that a baby? 
JENNY Yes. 
STAR MAN A baby is a new person? 
JENNY Eh... yes... 
STAR MAN Do you have a baby? 
JENNY No... The closest... 
STAR MAN Why? 
JENNY I'd love to have a baby. But I can't... 
STAR MAN Why? 
JENNY I can't... Forget the baby. Okay? The closest I was able to get you was Lathrop Wells. You'll have to hitchhike the rest of the way. 
The STAR MAN looks at the map. Lathrop Wells is a small town north of Las Vegas on Highway 95. From there he runs his finger to a spot in the Funeral Range of Death Valley. 
STAR MAN But I must go here. 
JENNY I know that. But the buses don't go there. 
STAR MAN (suspicious) What is hitchhike? 
JENNY That's easy. I'll explain that in a minute. This is your ticket. When you get on the bus here, the driver will take this part. You will ride to Omaha. When you get to Omaha, ask the driver. 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.' 
The STAR MAN nods that he understands. 
JENNY Say it. 
STAR MAN 'Salt Lake City, please. I do not speak English.' 
JENNY The driver will... 
STAR MAN But I speak English. 
JENNY Will you please do it my way? You'll get into trouble if you don't. If anybody talks to you, tell them... I do not speak English. 
STAR MAN (indignant) I do not speak English.

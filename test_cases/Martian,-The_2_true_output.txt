LISTENING FOR TELEMETRY SIGNAL... 
THEN: 
SIGNAL ACQUIRED. 
INT. JPL GARAGE - DAY 
Vincent, Bruce, and the JPL team see the words come up on the main screen. The room begins to BUZZ... 
EXT. HAB - DAY 
Mark stares at the high gain antenna on the Lander. It starts to MOVE... angling towards Earth. 
Mark begins to dance. 
INT. JPL GARAGE - DAY 
Vincent and Bruce cluster around the station of TIM GRIMES. 
TIM As soon as I received the high-gain response, I directed Pathfinder to take a panoramic image. 
VINCENT Have you received it yet? 
TIM Yes, but I thought we would all rather look at this black screen instead of a vibrant red planet. 
BRUCE (off Vincent's look) Tim is our finest comm tech, and we all appreciate his acerbic wit. 
Bruce mouths "I will fire you" to Tim. 
TIM Incoming. 
ON THE SCREENS: the panoramic starts to appear, one vertical stripe at a time. 
VINCENT Martian surface... more surface... 
BRUCE There's the Hab! 
VINCENT What's that? 
The image reveals a handwritten note, posted on a metal rod. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
VINCENT (CONT'D) "I'll write messages here. Are you receiving?" 
The image reveals two more notes, spaced a few feet apart. 
VINCENT (CONT'D) "Point here for yes." "Point here for no." 
TIM Thirty-two minute round trip communications time. He can only ask yes/no questions, and all we can do is point the camera. This won't exactly be an Algonquin round table of snappy repartee. 
BRUCE Tim. 
TIM Roger that. Pointing the camera... 
EXT. MARS - DAY 
Mark watches as the camera moves towards one of his notes. We ANGLE IN on the paper, focusing on one word in particular: 
"YES." 
MARK (PRELAP) So here's the rub... 
INT. HAB - DAY 
Mark addresses camera. 
MARK Somehow, we need to have complex astrophysical engineering conversations using only a still-frame camera. From 1996. Luckily, the camera spins 360, so I can make an alphabet. I just can't use our alphabet. Twenty-six letters plus question card into 360 gives us 13 degrees of arc. Too narrow. I wouldn't know what the camera was pointing at. So. Hexadecimals to the rescue... 
EXT. HAB - DAY 
Mark methodically sets up cards marked "A-F" and "0-9" in a circle around the camera. (CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
MARK (V.O.) I figured one of you guys kept an ASCII table somewhere... 
INT. HAB - DAY 
Mark sits in Johanssen's bunk. Scrolling through her laptop. 
MARK (V.O.) Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you supernerd Beth Johanssen, who also had copies of Zork 2 and Leather Goddesses of Phobos on her laptop. Seriously, Johanssen... it's like the Smithsonian of loneliness on there... 
INT. JPL GARAGE - DAY 
Tim consults an ASCII chart as he points the camera... 
EXT. HAB - DAY 
The camera swings from card to card... 
MARK (V.O.) Not that I'm complaining. 
INT. HAB - DAY 
Mark translates the numbers with his ASCII table:

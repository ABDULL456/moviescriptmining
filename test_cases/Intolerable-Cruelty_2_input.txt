MARYLIN I want to nail you ass. 
MILES Are you threatening me, because I'm sure that's a violation of the terms of your bail. 
MARYLIN I'm reporting you to the IRS. 
MILES The IRS? They owe me. I'm expecting a refund. 
He laughs. She looks at him, dead serious. 
MILES I'm clean with the IRS. I've reported every dollar I've ever made. Try again, girlfriend. 
MARYLIN I'm not talking about dollars, studmuffin. I'm talking about -- 
She opens a humidor and takes out a Cigar. 
MARYLIN STUFF. (Chomping on the Cigar) Got a light? 
MILES What kind of "stuff?" 
She reaches into her purse. Pulls out a Dunhill and expertly lights the cigar. 
MARYLIN Arty Farty stuff. (Pointing to the Hockney) Lithographs and pre Castro Cubans. Watches and mileage on private jets. Stuff, Miles. Stuff you get from grateful clients. 
MILES Those are gifts. 
MARYLIN Salary. Unreported income. (Glancing at his watch) By the way, what time IS it on Bellagio Road? 
MILES You can't prove anything. 
MARYLIN I don't have to. That's what the IRS guys do. And they do it with great zeal. See, they work at these tortuous civil service jobs, and when five hundred dollar an hour boys like you take their trade out in luxury goodies, these saps feel.. well, they feel like saps. And they feel bitter and they feel vengeful and they feel WRATH. (Puffing on the cigar) What is this? A Romeo and Julieta? 
MILES You're out of your league, Marylin. Rexroth was a primate. I'm a professional. 
MARYLIN I know. So am I, right? And so is Agent Wilson of the Internal Revenue Service. He's a dedicated, underpaid graduate of Southwestern University -- very tenacious, and never more so than when he's dealing with an unscrupulous colleague. (She stands to leave) I think it's only fair to warn you: I'm going to file an action, Miles. And after a decent interval I plan to have Ruth seek an injunction that will forbid your approach within 500 feet of my house. 
MILES Meaning my house. 
MARYLIN I believe the residence will be part of the settlement. 
MILES Did our marriage ever mean anything to you? 
MARYLIN Drop the bogus forgery charge and I'll forget about your generous friends slash clients. 
MILES That's blackmail. 
MARYLIN That's marriage. 
She gives him a peck on the cheek. As she leaves: 
MARYLIN You'll always be my favorite husband. 
Miles sits dejectedly on the new sofa looking at the paintings. He looks at the watch. And the cigars. And the picture of his mother. 
MILES Pity you can't be here. You'd enjoy this. 
CLOSE ON A BAG OF FLUIDS 
We pull back from the milky yellowish bag of fluid to show that a nurse is unhooking and removing it from under Herb Meyerson's wheelchair where it collects drainage. 
She now places it up on the IV gantry and connects, and swaps the now empty drip under the wheelchair to collect drainage. We are once again in Herb Meyerson's gloomy office, its venetians blocking most of the light and making Herb a dark, enigmatic figure. 
HERB This woman has humbled, shamed and disgrazed the entire foim. 
A reverse shows Miles standing in front of Herb's desk. 
MILES Yes Herb, 
HERB Counseluh, this foim deals in powuh. This foim deals in p'seption. This foim cannot prospuh... nor long endowwa. if it is p'seeved as dancin' to the music.. 
He waves his free arm to the beat of music unheard. 
HERB -- of the hoidy-goidy. 
MILES I understand Herb... I just... for the first time in my career -- I don't know what to do. I'm a patsy. A sitting duck. I'm lost.

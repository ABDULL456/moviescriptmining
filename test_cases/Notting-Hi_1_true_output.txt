ANNA I was. 
EXT. NOTTING HILL GARDEN - NIGHT 
A little later in the walk. 
ANNA What's in there? 
They are now walking by a five foot railing, with foliage behind it. 
WILLIAM Gardens.  All these streets round here have these mysterious communal gardens in the middle of them. They're like little villages. 
ANNA Let's go in. 
WILLIAM Ah no -- that's the point -- they're private villages -- only the people who live round the edges are allowed in. 
ANNA You abide by rules like that? 
WILLIAM Ahm... 
Her look makes it clear that she is waiting with interest on the answer to this. 
WILLIAM Heck no -- other people do -- but not me -- I just do what I want. 
He rattles the gate, then starts his climb -- but doesn't quite make it, and falls back onto the pavement... 
WILLIAM (casually) Whoopsidaisies. 
ANNA What did you say? 
WILLIAM Nothing. 
ANNA Yes, you did. 
WILLIAM No, I didn't. 
ANNA You said 'whoopsidaisies.' 
Tiny pause. 
WILLIAM I don't think so.  No one has said 'whoopsidaisies,' do they -- I mean unless they're... 
ANNA There's no 'unless.'  No one has said "whoopsidaisies" for fifty years and even then it was only little girls with blonde ringlets. 
WILLIAM Exactly.  Here we go again. 
He fails, and unfortunately, spontaneously... 
WILLIAM Whoopsidaisies. 
They look at each other. 
WILLIAM It's a disease I've got -- it's a clinical thing.  I'm taking pills and having injections -- it won't last long. 
ANNA Step aside. 
She starts to climb. 
WILLIAM Actually be careful Anna -- it's harder than it looks... 
But she's already almost over. 
WILLIAM Oh no it's not -- it's easy. 
A few seconds later.  Anna jumps down into the garden. 
ANNA Come on, Flops. 
William clambers over with terrible difficulty, dusts himself off, and heads towards where she stands. 
WILLIAM Now seriously -- what in the world in this garden could make that ordeal worthwhile?

A HORDE OF HIPSTER INDIE KIDS ATTACK SCOTT PILGRIM, ON BEAT. Scott swings at them with his FLAMING BLUE SWORD. He slashes at them to the beat, exploding each attacker into COINS. Scott then RUNS up the side of the pyramid towards Gideon. 
GIDEON GRAVES Ramona. My cane. Ramona hands Gideon a cane with G-MAN engraved on the handle. He unsheathes a SWORD that could not have fit in there. Scott and Gideon LEAP towards each other...Gideon descends like a vulture and SMASHES the sword out of Scott's hands. Scott hits the ground HARD, rolling to a stop. 
SCOTT Your club sucks, by the way. Gideon approaches, to administer a final blow. 
GIDEON If my cathedral of cutting edge taste holds no interest for your tragically Canadian sensibilities, then I shall grant you a swift exit from the premises. And fast entrance into HELLLLLLL. Gideon raises his sword. Then from above... 
KNIVES CHAU (O.S.) 
SCOOOOOOOOOTT!!! KNIVES CHAU sails into frame and KICKS the sword out of Gideon's hands. She lands awkwardly, tripping and falling down the side of the pyramid. Gideon chuckles. 
GIDEON GRAVES That is priceless. Scott looks to Knives, both concerned and amazed. She quickly recovers and POINTS a furious finger. 
'KNIVES CHAU, 18 YEARS OLD, FUN FACT: SCOTTAHOLIC'

KNIVES CHAU You'll pay for what you did to him! 
GIDEON GRAVES Listen, Kung Pao Chicken, your old old boyfriend brought this all on himself. He was warned plenty of times. But did he listen? Did he f- 
KNIVES CHAU I'm not talking to you. I'm talking to HER! Angle on a confused RAMONA standing behind Gideon. 
RAMONA What? 
KNIVES CHAU 
YOU BROKE THE HEART THAT BROKE 
MINE! GET READY TO CHAU DOWN! Knives leaps up the pyramid toward a shocked Ramona! 
RAMONA You're kidding right? Knives pulls out KNIVES and charges! Ramona fights defensively, redirecting Knives' parries without harming her. 
GIDEON You can't say I don't know how to put on a show. GIDEON lashes out at Scott. He can barely block Gideon's tremendous blows, distracted by his duelling exes. 
RAMONA What the hell is your deal? 
KNIVES CHAU You stole him with your advanced American slut technology. DUAL DUEL! The fighters weave in and out of each other, throwing blocks and punches, KUNG FU STYLE. 
RAMONA I don't know what you're talking about, I didn't steal anyone. Scott lands a KICK to Gideon's chest, sending him flying off the edge of the pyramid. He then BLOCKS a punch from Knives to Ramona and spins her away, separating them.

SCOTT Can we please stop all this fighting! Nobody stole anybody. Knives, I dated you and then I dated Ramona. Okay? 
(BEAT) I mean...maybe I kind of forgot to tell Knives right away, but... 
KNIVES CHAU Then you cheated on me, Scott! 
(EYES NARROWING) You cheated on both of us. Knives and Ramona both look at Scott, neither amused. 
RAMONA You cheated on me with Knives? 
SCOTT No! I cheated on Knives. With you. 
RAMONA Is there a difference? 
SCOTT You weren't wronged? Scott breaks into a flop sweat. 
SCOTT Right? Knives and Ramona stare at Scott. 
GIDEON (O.S.) Game over! STAB! A sword pierces Scott's chest from behind. 
GIDEON GRAVES Scottie. You can cheat on these ladies all you want, but you can't...cheat...death. Scott slides off Gideon's sword and falls to the ground... 
TEXT WITH ARROW POINTING TO SCOTT: 'DEAD' Everything goes white...SAND blows through frame...Scott's eyes blink open. He looks up into a BLINDING BLUE SKY... 
95 EXT. THE DREAM DESERT - DAY 95 
Scott sits up next to a lone cactus, rubbing his temples.

RAMONA I'm sorry. Dying probably sucks. 
SCOTT You know what sucks? Getting killed by THAT guy. Why him? 
RAMONA It's complicated. 
SCOTT Well, maybe now would be the time to get into it. Seeing as I'm about to die. 
RAMONA Alright... the truth is, it was me who was obsessed. I was crazy about him. But he ignored me. I was more alone when we were together than I ever was on my own. That's why I had to leave... and that's when he started paying attention. 
SCOTT So why go back? 
RAMONA I can't help myself around him, Scott. He just... has a way of getting into my head. 
SCOTT Well, that's legitimately disappointing. I really will leave you alone forever now... 
RAMONA No. I mean, he literally has a way of getting into my head. Ramona lifts her hair up on the back of her head, revealing a blinking CHIP implanted on her skull. 
SCOTT That is evil.

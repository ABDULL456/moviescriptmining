JOHNNY But now Danny's rattled, he won't be able to wait because you now know what's coming, so he's gonna fire. 
Danny, who is now in a state because Johnny has predicted everything he's going to do, suddenly turns with his gun. Mickey catches it, the force of the stop pulls the trigger, and the other MANS head is drilled through. Roman joins the wrestling match and gets the gun and wrist to aim at Danny's head. The trigger gets squeezed and Danny's head also gets a drilling. Silence. Johnny, who is smothered in blood, speaks coolly. 
JOHNNY STORY Mickey, pass me the gun. 
Mickey is out to lunch, but Johnny sounds commanding. JOHNNY STORY (CONT'D) MICKEY quickly, pass me that gun in Dannys hand. Don't worry he can't defend himself he doesn't have a head, quickly now. Does this answer the question that you two so frequently asked as to why I sought refuge in the depths and perverse beauty of the crack pipe? 
The elevator door opens.

BANDY Get fucking down! 
He looks on in horror and points the gun at Johnny. Just as he's about to fire,..there is a great smash of bone on timber. Bandy falls to reveal One Two standing there with a large piece of timber. 
ONE TWO I think we should get out of here now, don't you John? 
At which point in the background WE SEE Lenny being lowered to his demise. He looks at the group in horror as he is quickly lowered to his death by drowning and cray fish. FADE OUT.

VICTOR I don't like it Uri, I don't trust her. I put two of my people on her and they haven't come back. 
Very insulted. 
URI You what? I did not tell you to do this. If I had wanted her spied on I would have asked for it, wouldn't I? 
VICTOR Yes Uri, you would have, but I still don't like it. 
URI I don't care what you like Victor, I am in charge, now wait here. 
He gets out and walks to the door.

STELLA What is this for? 
URI Please do not be insulted, you have come to mean a lot to me and I value you much more than just your services. (pause) This is simply a reflection of my appreciation. (vulnerable he likes her) I would like to ask you something personal. 
His phone rings, he frowns slightly and answers it. 
URI (CONT'D) Not now Victor, I am busy. 
Uri turns. There, casually resting on the floor is his painting, his lucky painting. Uri's expression changes, his world has been shattered, he's thinking very ugly thoughts. He turns back to Stella, dead pan. 
URI (CONT'D) A very nice painting. How long have you had it? 
A little caught off guard. 
STELLA Years, it's my lucky painting,... it's very special isn't it? 
URI Beauty is a cruel mistress, is it not? 
Pause, she smiles. Uri talks back into the phone, the other darker Uri is now in charge. 
URI (CONT'D) Victor please, come to join us.

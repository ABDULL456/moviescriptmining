CUT TO: 
EXT     VATICAN ARCHIVES      NIGHT 
The face of Langdon's Mickey Mouse watch is smeared with blood from a cut on his hand, but we can still read the time. 
It's 9:41. 
Langdon and Chartrand stagger down the front steps of the Vatican Archives, where they're immediately met by three Vatican Police cars.    Olivetti leaps out of one and meets them at the base of the steps, holding his hands up in defense almost before Langdon can lay into him. 
LANGDON Are you out of your minds?! 
OLIVETTI Please.    In the car. 
LANGDON Someone tried to kill me. 
OLIVETTI Do you know where the next church is? 
LANGDON Yes. 
OLIVETTI Then get in the car! 
Langdon jumps in the back seat of the car with Olivetti, and they SQUEAL away from the Archives. 
IN THE CAR, 
they continue as the DRIVER tears through the streets of Rome. 
OLIVETTI We had no idea that -- 
LANGDON You heard me ask permission!    You assigned me an escort!    Don't try to tell me you didn't know I was in there! 
OLIVETTI (let me finish) Of course I knew, but we had no idea that portions of our white zones are 
OLIVETTI (cont'd) cross-wired with that building. Commander Rocher was extending the search, if he'd known the Archives were on that grid, he never would have killed the power. 
Langdon looks at him evenly, sees in Olivetti's eyes that they may be thinking the same thing. 
LANGDON Or there is the other possibility. 
Olivetti doesn't answer.     But he's thinking about it. 
LANGDON (cont'd) Infiltration is the Illuminati specialty -- why not the head of the Swiss Guard? 
OLIVETTI (AGONIZED) Perhaps. 
LANGDON I want to speak to the Camerlengo. 
OLIVETTI Il Camerlengo is unavailable, 
LANGDON Unavailable?        Why? 
OLIVETTI He's found evidence that the Holy Father was indeed murdered.    He is seeking guidance. 
LANGDON From whom? 
Olivetti looks at him   -- what are you, an idiot? 
OLIVETTI From God. 
LANGDON Oh, right. 
OLIVETTI Please.      Make an effort. 
CUT TO: 
INT     PAPAL OFFICE      NIGHT 
Vittoria, escorted by the two Swiss Guardsmen from the grottoes, returns to the papal office. 
She goes to the desk where she was sitting earlier, to resume her examination of the journals. 
But the desk is bare. 
VITTORIA The journals.        Where are they? 
The Guardsmen look at her blankly. 
VITTORIA   (cont'd) Who took the journals from this desk?! 
INT      APOSTOLIC PALACE - GREAT STAIRCASE        NIGHT 
The Camerlengo, in deep meditation, slowly descends the stairs that lead to the Sistine Chapel. 
At the bottom, Four Swiss Guard (in traditional garb) guard the locked doors. 
The Camerlengo reaches them.    Hesitates.      Looks heavenward for one last word of encouragement, and then -- 
CAMERLENGO Unseal the doors. 
INT     SISTINE CHAPEL       NIGHT 
There is an audible GASP from the assembled cardinals as the heavy locks CLUNK open, the chains RATTLE away, and the main doors of the Sistine Chapel sweep open. 
The Camerlengo walks in, a stark presence in his black cassock amid the sea of red robes. Cardinal Mortati steps from behind the altar to meet him. 
MORTATI Signore, do you realize that for the first time in Vatican history, a Camerlengo has just crossed the sacred threshold of conclave after sealing the doors? 
CUT TO: 
CAMERLENGO There has been a development.

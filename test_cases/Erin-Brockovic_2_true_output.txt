Erin and George are in bed, naked, curled around each other. 
GEORGE Man.  Even your earlobes are beautiful. 
He kisses one. 
ERIN Don't be too nice to me, okay?  It makes me nervous. 
INT. MASRY & VITITOE, ED'S OFFICE - DAY 
Ed is at his desk.  The PHONE RINGS.  And RINGS.  And RINGS. 
ED Brenda! (no answer) BRENDA! 
Nothing.  Ed growls in frustration, then gets the phone. 
ED Yeah, Ed Masry here ... She doesn't work here anymore.  Who's this? 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, KITCHEN - DAY 
CLOSE ON THE TABLE, where Beth is bobbing in her baby chair. On one side of her is a heap of bills with "PAST DUE" and "PLEASE REMIT" stamped on them.  On the other, the well- thumbed CLASSIFIED SECTION, with circles and X's all over it. 
The DOORBELL rings.  Erin swoops in and picks up Beth. 
ERIN Come on, baby.  Maybe that's Ed McMahon. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, FRONT DOOR - DAY 
Erin carries Beth over to the front door, spies through the peephole, and sees Ed standing there.  She opens the door. 
ERIN What are you doing here? 
ED I got an interesting call this afternoon. It was from a Dr. Frankel. 
ERIN Oh, yeah? 
ED He wanted you to know the legal limit for hexavalent chromium, is .05 parts per million.  And that at the rate you mentioned, .58, it could be responsible for the cancers in that family you asked about. The Irvings. 
ERIN Well, that was nice of him.  Isn't it funny how some people go out of their way to help people and others just give 'em the ax? 
ED Look, I'm sorry.  You were gone.  I just assumed you were off having fun. 
ERIN Now, why in the hell would you assume that? 
ED I don't know.  Maybe cause you look like someone who has a lot of fun. 
ERIN Boy, are you ever a shitty judge of people. 
Ed takes a beat, copping to the charge. 
ED So what's the story on this thing?  This cancer stuff? 
ERIN You wanna know, you gotta hire me back.  I got a lot of bills to pay. 
He glares at her.  Realizes he has no choice. 
ED Fine. 
INT. ERIN'S HOUSE, LIVING ROOM - LATER 
Erin has let Ed in.  They're sitting. 
ED But, PG&E told her about the chromium? 
ERIN They told her something, but it can't have been too specific, cause I talked to her, and she sure didn't think her water was bad. 
ED So what made you think it was? 
ERIN It doesn't take a genius to look at those medical records and think something's wrong. 
ED What medical records? 
ERIN The ones in the box of files. (off Ed's blank look) The box of files?  The one from your office? 
ED I didn't see any medical records in there. 
ERIN Boy, you musta really fine-tooth-combed it then, huh? (to herself) And you fired me.  Jesus. 
Ed thinks for a moment. 
ED That document you found, the one that says it was the bad chromium -- you didn't happen to make a copy did you? 
ERIN Course I did. 
ED Lemme see it, will you? 
Before getting it for him, she looks at him, weighs her odds. 
ERIN I want a raise.  And benefits.  Including dental. 
ED Look, Erin, this is not the way I do business, this extortion nonsense. 
Erin doesn't budge. 
ED Okay.  A 5% raise, and -- 
ERIN Ten. (off his look) There's a lot of other places I could work. 
ED A ten percent raise and benefits.  But that's it.  I'm drawing the line. 
She goes to her box of stuff from the office and digs out the document for him.  He scans it.

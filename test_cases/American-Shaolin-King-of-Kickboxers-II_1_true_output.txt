D.S. You don't like it, don't eat it. He takes the bowl away. 
DREW (CONT'D) I didn't say I wasn't going to eat it... Geez! He turns to the rest of the disciples. DREW (CONT'D) Well, at least we start training today, right, guys? 
A chorus of Yeahs. 
INT. DORM ROOM 足 SAME DAY ESTABLISHING SHOT OF DORM ROOM, ALL THE DISCIPLES CHANGING INTO THEIR WORKOUT CLOTHES. They are the standard fighting monk issue 足 suitable for martial arts training. DREW Wonder what they'll start us with first? LI Iron Palm? SHU Wooden Man, I think. 
WU 
No, it'll be basics, first day. Horse stance, kicks and punches... 
When they are all dressed, they run out of the room. 
EXT. TRAINING AREA 足 SAME DAY 
ESTABLISHING SHOT OF ALL THE DISCIPLES LINED UP, READY FOR THE TRAINING. 
In the b.g. are the fighting monks, going through their routines. 
ANGLE ON FIGHTING MONKS 
As they go through forms or free sparring. There are SHOTS of monks throwing stars, working with weapons, etc. It is all very exciting. 
ANGLE ON DREW 
Who is more excited than all the others. 
ANGLE ON THE D.S. As he walks to the front of the group. In his hand he is carrying a shovel. D.S. Bodhidharma, the patriarch of the Shaolin Temple taught us that to train the mind, we first have to train the body. ANGLE ON WU, WHO SHIELDS HIS MOUTH AND WHISPERS WU Basics, I told you. ANGLE ON D.S. 
Who motions to one of the monks behind him, who has a wheelbarrow filled with shovels. 
D.S. Each one of you take a shovel. DREW We're using the shovels as weapons? D.S. (smiling) Weapons... (beat) ... in the war on infection. D.S. motions with his hand, and in the distance is the latrine building. 
D.S. (CONT'D) 
You will be digging today, digging our new latrines. 
DREW 
Latrines? Why? 
D.S. 
A Shaolin fighting monk-in training does not ask questions. He just obeys. 
The D.S. leads the way to the latrine building, and the disciples follow, each of them carrying a shovel. Drew is trudging along, not believing what they are doing. 
DREW (CONT'D) 
I came halfway around the world to dig latrines? I could have just joined the army... 
DISSOLVE TO: LATRINE WORK AREA 足 MONTAGE MONTAGE SEQUENCE OF WORK DETAIL. 
ANGLE ON DREW AND THE OTHER DISCIPLES Digging with their shovels. Their training clothes are already sweated through and dirty. Their shirts are off, and their arm muscles are bulging and shining in the hot sunshine. ANGLE ON DREW As he lifts up two heavy buckets of dirt on a pole, then places the pole on his shoulders, the muscles in his arms, shoulders and back straining. He walks off to the side of the area to dump it. As he dumps the dirt, a pole appears and CRACKS across his back. He drops the buckets and falls to the ground. He gets up as quickly as 
he can, but there is no one to be seen. ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES As they are working hard on the latrines. Drew is teaching them an American song as they work. DREW (CONT'D) "Ain't no cure for the Shaolin Temple Blues... " OR "Working on a Chain Gang" OR (CONT'D) "I fought the law and the law won" OR (CONT'D) 
"16 tons" 
The monks are singing along with him. All except for Gao. 
ANGLE ON DREW AND DISCIPLES AS THEY EAT THEIR LUNCH 
It is again very meager: a bowl of rice, a bowl of soup and a piece of scrawny meat. Drew looks at it for a moment. The 
D.S. is standing over his shoulder. 
D.S.

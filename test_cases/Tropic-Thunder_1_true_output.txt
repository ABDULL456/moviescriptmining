EXT. FLAMING DRAGON COURTYARD -- CONTINUOUS 
They huddle close to the wall, unseen, surveying the situation: about 20 GUARDS on full alert... a JEEP about 30 feet away... beyond that, A HELIPAD with the compound's chopper, maybe 200 yards in the distance... 
SPEEDMAN That's their supply chopper. 
SANDUSKY If we could create a diversion, we could get to that jeep and drive it right over there...

SPEEDMAN You want a diversion? I'll give you a diversion. Is this baby loaded? He holds up the machine gun...

CARTRIDGE ON. THE GUARDS...

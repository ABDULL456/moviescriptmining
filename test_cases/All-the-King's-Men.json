Willie couldn't steal a vote from... from Abe Lincoln in the Cradle of the Confederacy. \nSADIE I wish the poor... had enough sense to have somebody give him a good greasing for the beating he's going to get. 'Cause this way all he gets out of it is the ride. (looks at Willie through the window) Hey, those speeches! Ain't they awful? Ain't they just plain awful? Question to you: if somebody told him he was a sucker, do you think he'd quit? \nWillie has just finished his speech and is on his way over to the hotel. \nJACK I don't know, Sadie. I really don't know. \nWILLIE (as he comes into the lobby) Did it sound all right, Mr. Burden? \nJACK Fine, Willie, fine. \nWILLIE Thanks. \nHe and Jack go upstairs together. Sadie watches them. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Sadie's Hotel Room (Upton), Night \nSadie lies on her bed, listening to Willie in the next room, rehearsing one of his speeches. \nWILLIE'S VOICE Now, friends, if you will bear patiently with me for a few minutes, I'll give you the figures. What we need is a balanced tax program... \nJACK'S VOICE No, Willie, no. \nSadie pulls off a shoe and hurls it at the wall. \nSADIE What I need is some sleep. Shut up! \nInterior: Jack's Hotel Room (Upton), Same Time \nWillie lies on his bed. Jack finishes shaving in the bathroom as he continues to rehearse him. \nJACK (shouting back at Sadie) Shut up yourself! (goes to bed, shakes Willie) Listen, Willie, try it on your feet this time. \nWILLIE Oh, no. Wait a minute. My feet are killing me. Let me stay here, huh? \nJACK All right... Look, Willie, you tell 'em too much. Just tell 'em you're going to soak the fat boys and forget the rest of the tax stuff. \nWILLIE (pathetically) That's what I say. \nJACK But it's the way you say it. Willie, make 'em cry. Make 'em laugh, make 'em mad, even mad at you. Stir 'em up and they'll love it and come back for more. But for heaven's sake don't try and improve their minds. \nWILLIE (suddenly) A man don't have to be governor. \nJACK (surprised) What? \nWILLIE A man don't have to be governor. \nPause. \nJACK Well, they haven't counted up the votes yet. \nWILLIE (quietly) Oh, I'm going to lose, Mr. Burden. I know that. Don't try and fool me. I'm not going to lie to you. I wanted it. I wanted it so badly I stayed up nights thinking about it. A man wants something so badly he gets mixed up in knowing what he wants. It's something inside of you. I would have made a good governor. Better than those other fellows. \nThere is a knock on the door. \nJACK Come in. \nWILLIE (almost to himself) A great governor. \nSadie enters. She immediately spots the liquor, and pours herself a drink. \nSADIE Since you won't let me sleep you might at least give me a drink. \nWILLIE (muttering) Build them highways... greatest system of highways in the country. \nJACK (to Sadie) Help yourself. \nWILLIE I'll build schools. \nSADIE (to Jack) What's up? \nJACK Nothing... except Willie here has been saying as how he's not going to be governor. \nSADIE (directly, to Jack) So you told him. \nJACK I don't tell anyone anything... I just listen. \nSADIE (goes to Willie) Who told you? \n", "test1_true": "SADIE That you're not going to be governor. \nWILLIE (getting up) Jack! Told me what?... Told me what? \nJack says nothing. Sadie gulps down her drink, bangs the empty glass on the bureau top, and turns to face Willie. \nSADIE (loudly) All right! That you've been framed, you poor sap. \nWillie looks at her steadily for a moment. \nWILLIE (quietly) Framed? \nSADIE And how! Oh, you decoy, you woodenhead decoy! And you let 'em. You let 'em because you thought you were the little lamb of God. But you know what you are? (she waits for his answer; he has none) Well, you're the goat! You are the sacrificial goat! You are a sap... because you let 'em. \nJACK Sadie! That's enough. \nSADIE Enough? He didn't even get anything out of it. Oh, they'd have paid you to take a rap like that, but they didn't have to pay a sap like you. Oh, no, you were so full of yourself and hot air, all you wanted was a chance to stand up on your hind legs and make a speech: my friends, what this state needs is a good five-cent cigar. What this state needs is a -- \nWILLIE (to Jack) Is it true? \nSADIE (prayerfully, to the ceiling) He wants to know if it's true. \nWILLIE Is it true? \nJACK That's what they tell me. \nThere is a long pause. Willie looks almost as if he is going to cry. Sadie pours out another drink, a stiff one. \nSADIE (handing it to him) Here. \nWillie drinks it all. \nJACK Hey, lay off that. You're not used to it. \nSADIE (jeeringly) He's not used to a lot of things. Are you, Willie? \nJACK (angrily) Why don't you lay off of him, Sadie? \nSADIE (ignores Jack) Are you, Willie? Are you? Are you... are you, are you, are you? \nShe shoves the bottle at him. He takes it and pours himself a drink. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Sadie's Hotel Room (Upton), Morning \nWillie is snoring on the bed. Sadie's coat is thrown over him. She is in the bathroom, applying lipstick. Jack enters. \nSADIE Hi. \nJACK Well, things seem to have quieted down. \nSADIE (laughs) Yeah, I quieted him down. \nJACK Yeah. How was he? Noisy? \nSADIE Oh, he reared some. He's been telling me all the things he's going to do. He's going to do big things, this fella. He's going to be President. He's going to kill people with his bare hands. I quieted him down... Hey! Who's Lucy? \nJACK His wife. \nSADIE He talks like she's his mammy... she's going to blow his nose for him. \nJack sits on the bed next to Willie. \nJACK Well, I'll take him from here on in. They're waiting for him at the barbecue. \nSadie pulls her coat off Willie and goes to the door. \nSADIE Yeah, well give me a receipt for the body and I'll be on my way. \nShe leaves. Jack bends over Willie, who continues to snore. \nJACK Hey, Willie, Willie... come on, wake up, Willie.

We want Willie! \nA high angle from the balcony shows Anne, Jack, and Adam in the center of the excited crowd, looking expectantly upward. Some of the people around them are carrying torches. Arc lights play over the dome of the state capitol in the background. In response to the chants, Willie appears on the balcony. With him, standing on the balcony, are Tom and Lucy. The crowd erupts into cheers as he steps outside. \nWILLIE (raises his hands for silence) This is not a time for speechmaking. I should get on my knees and ask God to give me strength to carry out your will. \nLoud cheers. Adam watches Anne. She applauds. Willie looks down at the crowd and continues his speech. \nWILLIE This much I swear to you. These things you shall have. I'm going to build a hospital. The biggest that money can buy... and it will belong to you. That any man, woman, or child who is sick or in pain can go through those doors and know that everything will be done for them that man can do. To heal sickness. To ease pain. Free. Not as a charity, but as a right. And it is your right that every child shall have a complete education. That any man who produces anything can take it to market without paying toll. And no poor man's land or farm can be taxed or taken away from him. And it is the right of the people that they will not be deprived of hope... \nThe crowd applauds, and Willie waves. We see Anne, face aglow, turn to Jack. \nANNE Does he mean it, Jack? Does he? \nSTANTON (as he walks away) That's his bribe. \nAnne and Jack watch Adam as he leaves. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nMontage: Willie Becomes Governor \nWillie, Sadie, and Jack leaving their old campaign headquarters. \nWillie, Sadie, Jack, and others going upstairs in the governor's mansion. The ousted politicians are just packing up and leaving. \nJACK (voice over) What if it was his bribe! He swept the old gang out of office. What if they hollered like stuck pigs? He jammed through bill after bill and the people got what they wanted. \nWillie yelling at the legislators during a session. \nWILLIE I demand that this bill be passed. Nobody's going to tell me how to run this state. \nRoad excavation -- a bulldozer clears away dirt. \nA huge crane maneuvers over a dam site. Men are seen working on the girders of a large power plant. \nJACK (voice over) He started to build the roads, the schools, the power dams, to change the face of the state from one end to the other... His methods? \nShots of uniformed policemen roughing up citizens. Willie and Sugar Boy move in on a man being held by cops. \nWillie looks on as Jack thumbs through his little black book. \nJACK (voice over) Politics is a dirty game... and he played it rough and dirty. Willie's little black book was a record of sin and corruption. And me, Jack Burden? I kept the book and added up the accounts. \nWillie in a nightclub, surrounded by some show girls. A photographer takes a picture of Willie with a girl balanced on his knee. \nWillie leads a marching band out onto a football field. \nJACK (voice over) Clown, show-off, playboy, they yelled at him. Building football stadiums. Fiercely proud of his son who played in them. \nShot of Tom in football uniform running across the field with the ball. Willie, in the stands, hugs Lucy. \nWILLIE Oh, look at him go. He's going to be All-American. \nWillie makes an inspection of the police.

Willie loved it... and so did I. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nInterior: Executive Office Corridor, Day \nJack walks down the corridor on the way to Willie's offices. \nInterior: Willie's Executive Offices, Day \nAs Jack enters from the corridor, Sadie is coming out of Willie's private office. \nSADIE (through open door) You low-down, no-good redneck... \n", "test2_true": "JACK (to secretary) What goes on here? \nSECRETARY That's what Sadie wants to know.

She ignores it. \nSADIE Was she pretty? \nJACK If I met her on the street I'd never recognize her. \nSADIE Was she pretty? \nJACK How should I know? I wasn't looking at her face... Look, if it's going to cause all this grief, why don't you let him go? \nSADIE Let him go? I'll kill him. I'll drive him out of this state. \nJACK Just because a guy's sitting with a couple of girls on his knees in public... \nSADIE Public or private... I know him. How about what happened in Chicago? That girl on skates... and the time you both went to St. Louis... There's a new invention, you know, Photography and newsreels. Willie Stark in a nightclub... Willie Stark with a blonde. \nJACK You could always bleach your hair. \nSADIE I could also break every bone in his neck. After all I've done for him... Now he goes two-timing me. \nJACK He's been two-timing Lucy. So there's another kind of arithmetic for what he's doing to you. \nSADIE Lucy? (laughs) If she had her way he'd be back in Kanoma City slopping the hogs right now. And he knows it. He knows what she'd do for him. She had her chance. \nJACK You seem to think Lucy's on her way out, don't you? \nSADIE He'll ditch her... Give him time. \nJACK You ought to know. \nShe slaps his face. \nJACK Hey, you got the wrong guy. I'm not the hero of this piece. \nThe door to Willie's office bursts open and Willie dashes out. \nWILLIE All right, come on, both of you. Let's go, hurry it up. \nThey go out through the reception room, pick up Sugar Boy, and head down the corridor. \nWILLIE Come on. Pillsbury put his hand in the pork barrel and got caught. You know, I never did trust that guy. \nSome newsmen are waiting on the top landing. \nNEWSMEN Have you heard about Pillsbury? What do you intend to do about Pillsbury? How about it, Governor? \nWillie pushes by them. \nWILLIE Later, boys, later. (to Jack) Say, Jack, go back and get the Judge. Let's get him over to my hotel just as soon as you can. \nThey all hurry after Willie as he rushes down the stairs. \nInterior: Lobby State Capitol, Day \nAnne is about to go up the stairs when she meets Willie and the others on the way down. \nANNE (to Willie) I waited for you.

A marching band plays music for them. \nExterior: Capitol Building, Day \nCrowd waiting outside the building. Mounted policemen keep them in line. From a large platform, loaded with people, comes the chant \"We want Willie, we want Willie.\" Jack pushes his way through the people and speaks to a policeman standing guard on the Capitol steps. \nCOP Where do you think you're going? (recognizes Jack) Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you. \nJACK Do you know who Dr. Stanton is? \nCOP Yes sir. \nJACK Did he try to come through here today? \nCOP Haven't seen him, sir. \nJACK Well, can you check the other entrances? \n2ND COP There's no other entrances today. The other entrances are blocked off. Orders are to take no chances. \nCOP If you care to come inside and wait, Mr. Burden, we can find you a seat. \nJACK No, thanks. I'll wait out here. If Dr. Stanton shows up, let me know. Pass the word along to the boys, will you? \nCOP Yes sir. \nJack turns and looks at the large crowd. A voice from a public address loudspeaker begins to yell out commands to the crowd. \nLOUDSPEAKER All right now. Everybody... that means everybody... let's let Willie know we're here! All together: WE WANT WILLIE. WE WANT WILLIE. \nThe chant is picked up enthusiastically by the crowd. \nInterior: State Legislature, Day \nThe speaker is trying to speak over the clamor of the chanting. \nSPEAKER We will first proceed to take the judgment of the senate on the question of the impeachment of the governor. \nSENATOR (rising) Mr. Speaker, this is a farce to ask us to vote in the face of the kind of intimidation and pressure that has been exerted here in the past few weeks. Even that crowd outside, yelling on cue, is part of that pressure. \nCROWD NOISE We want Willie. We want Willie. \nWillie gets up, and goes to the window. \nExterior: State Capitol, Day \nThe crowd, with Jack in the foreground. The crowd suddenly goes wild as they see Willie appear at the window. In the growing darkness he seems only a shadowy figure as he raises his hands to wave to the crowd. \nWe see various shots of people straining to get a little closer to the steps in order to see him better. Willie then turns and goes back into the room. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: State Capitol, Day \nThe crowd again, still waiting. The camera pans upward to a loudspeaker. \nANNOUNCER Attention, please. Attention, please. This is a special announcement from Willie Stark to you people out there. He doesn't want any one of you to leave... \nThe camera moves over the faces of the people listening. \nANNOUNCER He wants you to stay in front of this state Capitol until the fight is over. If you want Willie Stark to win, stay where you are. \nThey cheer. Camera picks up Jack watching the crowd's reaction, then up to a plaque over the entrance to the Capitol Building. It reads THE PEOPLE'S WILL IS THE LAW OF THIS STATE -- GOVERNOR STARK. \nANNOUNCER Do you hear me... stay where you are. Don't go away. Stay where you are.

The balloting on the impeachment proceedings against Governor Stark has just ended. This is the result: Willie Stark has won. \nThe crowd explodes. People break through the police barriers. Mounted policemen ride in quickly to prevent a riot. Camera picks up Anne in the crowd, trying to push through. \nJack stands on the steps of the Capitol, watching it all. Suddenly Willie appears at the top of the steps, followed by Sugar Boy. Sadie, Duffy, Pillsbury follow close behind. Willie grabs hold of the mike and addresses the suddenly hushed crowd. \nWILLIE They tried to ruin me. But they are ruined. They tried to ruin me because they did not like what I have done. Do you like what I have done? \nLoud applause, and cries of \"yes.\" \nWILLIE Remember, it's not I who have won, but you. Your will is my strength, and your need is my justice, and I shall live in your right and your will. And if any man tries to stop me from fulfilling that right and that will, I'll break him. I'll break him with my bare hands. For I have the strength of many. \nHaving finished, he waves at them all. Then he notices Jack and comes down the steps to greet him. \nWILLIE Hello, Jack boy, I'm glad you're here. I knew you'd come back. \nHe walks back up the steps, his arm around Jack's shoulders. They start to go into the building that way when Willie sees someone. He smiles and puts out his hand. \nWILLIE Oh, doctor, I'm very glad to see you. \nAdam is seen, waiting at the entrance of the building. Before Willie has taken a step Adam fires several shots into him. Willie falls to the ground and Sugar Boy whips out his pistol and fires at Adam. Three policemen with tommy guns open fire, shooting into Adam's already fallen body. Then they turn and point their guns at the mob of people rushing toward Willie, forcing them back. \nCOP Stand back, everybody. Stand back. \nSugar Boy kneels beside Willie. Sadie stands against a pillar, looking down on him. \nSUGAR BOY (nearly crying) D-does it hurt m-much, boss? D-d- does it hurt much? \nJack looks up to see Anne struggling through the screaming mob to get to Adam. She looks at Adam for a moment, then turns away. \nJACK Anne, Anne... Where are you going? \nShe doesn't answer, only walks away. He runs after her and catches hold of her arm. \nANNE I don't know. Leave me alone. \nJACK To do what? \nANNE I don't care. \nJACK No, that's too easy. \nANNE I don't know, I don't know, I don't know. \nJACK I do. \nANNE Leave me alone, please. \nJACK No, no more. \nANNE He's dead. \nJACK We're alive. \nANNE My brother's dead. \nJACK We've got to go on living. \nANNE How? \nJACK So that Adam's death has meaning, so that it wasn't wasted. Anne, our life has to give his death meaning. Don't you see that? Look at those people... \nHe turns her around so that she can see the crowds still struggling to get a look at Willie. \nJACK Look at them! They still believe in him. And we've got to make them see Willie the way Adam saw him, or there's no meaning in anything... anything. \nA policeman approaches. \nPOLICEMAN Mr. Burden... the governor's asking for you. You better hurry. He's going fast. \nJACK (to Anne) Will you wait here? \nNo reply. \nJACK Will you wait here? \nShe nods her head slowly. Jack walks through the building to the pillar against which Willie has been propped. Sugar Boy is still beside him. He stands behind Sadie and Duffy, looking down at Willie. \nWILLIE It could have been the whole world, Willie Stark. The whole world... Willie Stark. Why did he do it to me... Willie Stark? Why? \nHis head droops to the side and he dies. \nFADE OUT \nTHE END \n", "test3_id": 1088}

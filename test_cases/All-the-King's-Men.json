{"train": "ALL THE KING'S MEN \nWritten by \nRobert Rossen \nBased on the novel by \nRobert Penn Warren \nSHOOTING DRAFT \nInterior: Jack Burden's Desk, The Chronicle, Day \nJack Burden is looking over the morning edition of \"The Chronicle.\" He reads the society page. A man enters and leans across his desk. \nMAN Burden! Jack Burden! The boss wants to see you. \nHe folds his paper, rises, and walks by the presses into Madison's office. \nInterior: Madison's Office, Day \nMadison, the city editor, is correcting copy at his desk. \nMADISON Hey, Jack, ever hear of a fellow called Willie Stark? \nJACK No. Who'd he shoot? \nMADISON Oh, county... uh... treasurer, or something like that. \nJACK What's so special about him? \nMADISON They say he's an honest man. What I want you to do is to hop into your car... \nJACK Why, you promised me a vacation. \nMADISON Well, that can wait. \nJACK Yeah... but there's a... a girl I know. \nHe opens his newspaper to the society page and shows Madison a photograph of Anne Stanton. \nMADISON Oh... Well, she can wait too. \nJack takes the paper back and looks at it. \nJACK The question is... can I? \nMADISON The answer is... get up there. \nJACK Right. (starts to go) Oh... uh... what did you say his name was? \nMADISON Who? \nJACK The fellow's name. \nMADISON Oh, the... uh... Stark... Willie Stark. \nMadison goes on with his work. \nJACK (as he leaves) Willie Stark... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Kanoma City, Day \nAs Jack Burden's jalopy pulls up before the Kanoma County Courthouse of this back-country, one-street small town. \nJACK (voice over) I found him in Kanoma City. A typical, hot, dusty, backwoods county seat. \nHe gets out of the car, and notices a crowd of people gathered around a platform in the town square. As he walks over the begins to hear the words that Willie Stark is speaking. \nWILLIE ...to lie to them in order to line their own dirty pockets with the taxpayers' money. When have the citizens of Kanoma County ever witnessed a campaign like this? Why is the opposition so anxious to defeat me? Why have they used every dirty method known to make sure I'm not elected county treasurer? Well, I'll tell you why... \nA man in shirt sleeves and suspenders, Tiny Duffy, comes out of the local poolroom, listens for a moment to Willie's speech, and signals to two uniformed men to go over and break up the gathering. \nJack Burden stands close to the platform, next to Willie's son, Tom, who waits patiently to distribute handbills. \nWILLIE ...Because they're afraid of the truth... and the truth is this. They're trying to steal your money. Yeah, I said steal. The county commissioners rejected the bid on the schoolhouse. Why? Well, they'll tell you their reason is the job will be done better. The county commissioners would have you believe that they're interested in public welfare. They're interested in welfare, sure. But it's their own. Let's look at the reason in the light of the facts and the figures. That brick factory is owned by one of the commissioners. That same brick factory uses convict labor. \nThe sheriff and his deputy push through the crowd. \nSHERIFF Sorry, Willie, you'll have to move on. \nWILLIE Why? \nSHERIFF City Ordinance Number One-Oh-Five: more than five people congregating is disturbing the peace. \nWILLIE I'm going to be on that same street corner tomorrow, Mr. Duffy. \nDUFFY You go right ahead, Willie. We all believe in free speech. We got to... it's in the Constitution. \nWILLIE My boy is out distributing those handbills now. \nDUFFY It's a free country, Willie. If you can convince the people to vote for you... you go right ahead. \nWILLIE What did you want to see me about, Mr. Duffy? \nDUFFY I wanted you to meet a fella came all the way up from the state capital to meet you. A reporter. Wants to write you up... maybe put your picture in the paper. \nWILLIE (turns to Jack) I'm happy to know you, sir. \nJACK Burden's my name... Jack Burden. Can we go somewhere where we can talk? \nDUFFY Now that ain't polite. Don't you want to hear both sides of the story? \nJack examines the camera that has just been returned to him. \nJACK I know your side. (finds the plate missing) What happened to the plate your men took from my camera? \nDUFFY Must have dropped out. Oh, come on, fellas, let's relax. It's a hot day... Hey, Sugar Boy... \nSUGAR BOY Yeah? \nDUFFY Bring some cold beer for the boys. \nWILLIE None for me, thank you kindly. \nPILLSBURY Now you know Willie don't drink, Tiny. His wife don't favor drinking. And Willie's the teacher's pet, ain't you, Willie? \nWILLIE I'll have some orange pop if you don't mind. \nDuffy roars with laughter. \nDUFFY Orange pop! All right, Sugar Boy. Bring him some orange pop. \nSUGAR BOY (stutters) Th-th-the p-p-pop's s-s-sold out. \nDUFFY Did you hear that, boys? The p-p- pop's s-s-sold out. \nThey all laugh. \nPILLSBURY Now ain't he a card? \nWILLIE (his face hard) He stutters, Mr. Duffy, but you... you don't say anything. (to Jack) Let's go, mister. \nThey turn and go out. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Dirt Road, Day \nJack is driving Willie home to his farmhouse. They pass a farmer and his family walking by the side of the road. Willie smiles and waves to them. \nExterior: Stark Farmhouse, Day \nAs the car pulls into the drive we see Pa Stark in his rocking chair on the porch, and Lucy, who stands at the top of the steps, waiting to welcome Willie. \nWILLIE (as they go up the steps) This is my wife, Lucy, Mr. Burden. \nJACK AND LUCY How do you do? \nWILLIE That's my pa. \nJack reaches out to shake his hand. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Stark Farmhouse, Night \nWillie finishes chewing his food, pats his mouth with a napkin, and pushes his plate back. \nWILLIE Now we'll talk. \nCamera pulls back to include Jack, Lucy, and Pa, all seated around the dinner table. \nJACK You've been talking for a long time, Mr. Stark. \nPAPPY Willie's got a lot to say. \nLUCY You sleepy, Pappy? You want to have a nap? \nPAPPY No, I want to hear it. \nLucy gets up and turns on a light in the kitchen. \nJack's fingers type out a story, the last line of which reads \"an honest man with courage.\" He pulls the sheet out and hands it to Madison. \nJACK Here you are... the last of the Willie Stark articles. Now can I go? \nMADISON Yes. You've earned your vacation. You've been writing these like you really mean them. \nJack rises and walks toward the door. \nJACK I do. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Ferry To Burden's Landing, Day \nJack's car is ferried across the bay to the slip of Burden's Landing. \nJACK (voice over) I hadn't been home in a long time. Only a hundred and thirty miles from Kanoma City. It was separated from the mainland by a body of water. For the first time I wondered if it wasn't separated by more than that. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Mrs. Burden's Home, Day \nAs Jack arrives, Mrs. Burden and her husband, McEvoy, are seated at a lawn table near the boat landing. \nJACK Hello, Mother. \nShe runs forward to meet him. \nMRS. BURDEN Floyd, Jack's home. Oh, he looks fine... doesn't he look fine? (to Jack, coquettishly) How do I look, Jackie boy? \nJACK You look beautiful, Mother. \nMRS. BURDEN I've got so many things planned for you... parties and... it'll be just like old times. But first, let's have a drink. \nMCEVOY Can't that wait until this evening? \nShe goes ahead and pours the drinks. \nMRS. BURDEN Floyd... honey... my son's home. \nMCEVOY How long do you plan on staying? \nJACK (coldly) Two or three weeks. If that's all right with you. \nMRS. BURDEN I'm sure your father would be -- \nJACK Stepfather, Mother. \nMRS. BURDEN (reproachfully) Now, Jackie... here we all are. Floyd, Jackie, myself. (raises her glass for a toast) To the best time we've ever had together. \nJACK Yes, Mother. \nThey drink. Mrs. Burden gulps hers down avidly. Jack looks at her and then at McEvoy. \nJACK Excuse me... I... \nHe turns and walks back toward the shore. He boards a small motorboat and heads toward a house that can be seen across the water. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Stanton Home (Burden's Landing), Day \nAs the boat approaches the shore. Adam Stanton reaches down and pulls the boat up on land. He throws his arm around Jack, and the two climb the hill toward Judge Stanton, who stands waiting to greet him. \nJACK Dr. Stanton, I presume. \nSTANTON (laughing) Is my shingle showing? \nJUDGE Good to see you, boy. Very good. \nJACK Good to see you, Judge. How have you been? What have you been doing? \nThey walk back together to the patio tables. \nJUDGE Oh, just sitting here... waiting for all of you to come home. You know, when a man starts to get old his eyes stray and play funny tricks on him. As I watched you in that boat I thought sure I saw a boy of twelve with a fishing rod in his hands. And I was sure the first thing he'd say would be... \nJack catches sight of Anne Stanton walking down the path. He runs to meet her. As they embrace, he looks back at the Judge. \nJACK Do you mind if I kiss your niece, sir? \nHe kisses her, and they turn and walk away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Tennis Court (Burden's Landing), Day \nAnne gracefully returns a ball to Jack, then runs to embrace him at the net. Adam, seated near the court, smiles approvingly. \nMRS. BURDEN I've got to live with him. \nJACK Well, I don't. Neither do you. You don't love him, Mother. You never did. \nMRS. BURDEN Son, don't spoil anything now... He can help you. \nJACK I can get along without him. You need this house. And the parties. And the cars and the clothes and the lies. I don't. It's the truth, Mother, face it. For once in your life, face it. \nMrs. Burden appeals to Anne. \nMRS. BURDEN Anne, please... please make him understand. \nAnne says nothing. Mrs. Burden goes back into the house. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Stanton Living Room, Night \nAnne and Jack sit alone in the room, beneath the portrait of the old Governor Stanton. \nJACK Anne, Burden's Landing is a place on the moon. It isn't real. It doesn't exist. It's me pretending I live on what I earn. It's my mother trying to keep herself young, and drinking herself old doing it. It's you and Adam living in this house as though your father were still alive. It's an old man like the Judge dreaming of the past... Anne, come away with me. \nANNE And do what? \nJACK (rises impatiently) And live in a shack and eat red beans. Anne, what do you want me to do? \nANNE Oh, Jack, Jack, you haven't been sure. You've gone from one thing to the other... a year at law school, and now this job as a reporter... \nJACK Are you afraid I can't make a living? \nANNE Oh, no, Jack, it isn't that. I don't care about the money. It... it's just that I... I want you to be something. \nJACK What is it you want me to be? \nANNE I don't know. It's just that I want you to be... to do... something important. \nJack looks up at the portrait of Governor Stanton. \nJACK Like your father. All right. I'll run for governor. (pause) Anne, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I said that. \nANNE All right, Jack. I'll go away with you. I'll do anything you want me to do. \nThey kiss. \nJACK Anne, I've wanted you to say that more than anything in the world, and now that you've said it... Anne, I guess you were right. I'm not sure of anything, including myself. I'm not sure I could live up to the... (looks again at the portrait) Anne, wait for me. Please wait for me. \nANNE I'll wait for you. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Madison's Office, Day \nMadison is at his desk as Jack enters. \nMADISON Hello, Jack. Cut your vacation short, didn't you? \nJACK Yeah. \nMADISON By the way, Jack, the fellow you wrote the articles about... uh... Stark. \nJACK Yeah? \nMADISON He lost. \nJACK Well, I guess that's the end of Willie Stark. \nHe turns around and walks off toward his desk. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nInterior: Stark Farmhouse, Night \nLucy and Willie are seated together at the table. Willie has his law books open before him. \nWILLIE ...Measure of the damages is caused by... \nLUCY (prompting) A breach... \nWILLIE A breach... \nLUCY Of an agreement... \nWILLIE Of an agreement... \nLUCY To sell personal property... \nAn article is pasted in a scrapbook. It reads: \"VOICE IN THE WILDERNESS. Recent school tragedy is a potent reminder that a man named Willie Stark...\" A hand draws a pencil underneath the name. \nWILLIE'S VOICE A voice in the wilderness. A man named Willie Stark... \nCamera pulls back to show Willie at the table busy with his scrapbook. He looks up at Lucy. \nWILLIE How about that, Lucy, that's me. \nShe looks at him, unsmiling, and sits down to help him clip various articles from other papers. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Stark Farmhouse, Night \nA series of clippings are being pasted in the scrapbook. They read: \nA. SCHOOL VICTIMS SUE COUNTY: STARK FILES DAMAGE SUIT \n\"Will prove graft cause of tragedy,\" says Attorney Stark. \nB. CITIZENS COMMITTEE FORMED \nDraft Stark to lead fight to rid state of graft. \nC. CITIZENS COMMITTEE DEMANDS STATE-WIDE INVESTIGATION \nD. Large photograph of Willie. Under it, the caption: RURAL AREAS IN REVOLT \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Madison's Office, The Chronicle, Day \nThe clippings are spread out on Madison's desk. He looks up at Jack. \nMADISON Get up there. Get up there fast. Your friend, Willie, is hotter than a firecracker. \nJack starts toward the door. \nMADISON Stay there with him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Harrison's Political Headquarters (State Capital), Day \nA politician points to a map on the wall. \nPOLITICIAN Look, before this Kanoma City business we had this whole area tied up. Now we're losing to Hickville. \nCamera pulls back, revealing the candidate, Harrison, Tiny Duffy, and a woman, Sadie Burke. \nPOLITICIAN We must find a way to split that vote. \nHARRISON Well, all I know is, the way it is now it looks like I'm not going to win. \nPOLITICIAN I know a way... find a dummy. \nSADIE Find a dummy. (looks at Harrison) That's what we've got. \nPOLITICIAN A guy from the sticks... strong enough to grab some votes and dumb enough not to ask questions. \nDUFFY If you want to listen to a boy from the sticks, I know just the guy. \nThey crowd around to listen. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Stark Farmhouse, Day \nJack sits at the dinner table, with Willie and Lucy. Tom stands next to Willie. Pappy dozes in his chair. \nJACK No more politics, eh, Willie? \nWILLIE No, I worked too hard in my time to get there. I think I'll just go on practicing law and make a little more money. \nJACK The question I'd like to know is, why all the speeches you're making around the countryside? \nWillie is about to answer when he hears the sound of approaching cars. \nWILLIE Wonder who that is? \nHe goes to the window, and we see a big black limousine turning into his drive. He opens the door and waits as Sadie, Duffy, Dolph Pillsbury, and other politicians climb the steps to meet him. \nDUFFY Brought some people all the way up from the state capital just to meet you. (turns to others) Folks, I want you to meet Willie Stark, the next governor of our state. \nWillie, Lucy, and Tom beam happily. Jack looks skeptically at Sadie, whose only reaction is to smile, politely. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSADIE If you know, why do you ask? \nJACK I just want to make sure. \nSADIE Yeah. \nJACK Look, why don't you tell the boys back home to save their money. Willie couldn't steal a vote from... from Abe Lincoln in the Cradle of the Confederacy. \nSADIE I wish the poor... had enough sense to have somebody give him a good greasing for the beating he's going to get. 'Cause this way all he gets out of it is the ride. (looks at Willie through the window) Hey, those speeches! Ain't they awful? Ain't they just plain awful? Question to you: if somebody told him he was a sucker, do you think he'd quit? \nWillie has just finished his speech and is on his way over to the hotel. \nJACK I don't know, Sadie. I really don't know. \nWILLIE (as he comes into the lobby) Did it sound all right, Mr. Burden? \nJACK Fine, Willie, fine. \nWILLIE Thanks. \nHe and Jack go upstairs together. Sadie watches them. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Sadie's Hotel Room (Upton), Night \nSadie lies on her bed, listening to Willie in the next room, rehearsing one of his speeches. \nWILLIE'S VOICE Now, friends, if you will bear patiently with me for a few minutes, I'll give you the figures. What we need is a balanced tax program... \nJACK'S VOICE No, Willie, no. \nSadie pulls off a shoe and hurls it at the wall. \nSADIE What I need is some sleep. Shut up! \nInterior: Jack's Hotel Room (Upton), Same Time \nWillie lies on his bed. Jack finishes shaving in the bathroom as he continues to rehearse him. \nJACK (shouting back at Sadie) Shut up yourself! (goes to bed, shakes Willie) Listen, Willie, try it on your feet this time. \nWILLIE Oh, no. Wait a minute. My feet are killing me. Let me stay here, huh? \nJACK All right... Look, Willie, you tell 'em too much. Just tell 'em you're going to soak the fat boys and forget the rest of the tax stuff. \nWILLIE (pathetically) That's what I say. \nJACK But it's the way you say it. Willie, make 'em cry. Make 'em laugh, make 'em mad, even mad at you. Stir 'em up and they'll love it and come back for more. But for heaven's sake don't try and improve their minds. \nWILLIE (suddenly) A man don't have to be governor. \nJACK (surprised) What? \nWILLIE A man don't have to be governor. \nPause. \nJACK Well, they haven't counted up the votes yet. \nWILLIE (quietly) Oh, I'm going to lose, Mr. Burden. I know that. Don't try and fool me. I'm not going to lie to you. I wanted it. I wanted it so badly I stayed up nights thinking about it. A man wants something so badly he gets mixed up in knowing what he wants. It's something inside of you. I would have made a good governor. Better than those other fellows. \nThere is a knock on the door. \nJACK Come in. \nWILLIE (almost to himself) A great governor. \nSadie enters. She immediately spots the liquor, and pours herself a drink. \nSADIE Since you won't let me sleep you might at least give me a drink. \nWILLIE (muttering) Build them highways... greatest system of highways in the country. \nJACK (to Sadie) Help yourself. \nWILLIE I'll build schools. \nSADIE (to Jack) What's up? \nJACK Nothing... except Willie here has been saying as how he's not going to be governor. \nSADIE (directly, to Jack) So you told him. \nJACK I don't tell anyone anything... I just listen. \nSADIE (goes to Willie) Who told you? \nWillie takes a seat on the children's swing as Jack goes off to get some coffee. Two little girls stare curiously at him. Willie waves them off. Jack returns with the coffee and pours some whisky in it. Willie tips his hand, forcing him to pour more, then gulps his drink down. \nExterior: Bandstand (Upton), Day \nDuffy, Pillsbury, and the other politicians stand on the platform, waiting for Willie. A band plays march music. Duffy goes over to Sadie, who is standing on the steps of the platform. \nDUFFY Where is he? \nSADIE (pointing) There he is. \nEscorted by Jack, Willie approaches the platform and stumbles up the steps past Sadie. \nSADIE Whoops! \nDUFFY (to Jack) Is he drunk? \nJACK Never touches the stuff. Lucy doesn't favor drinkin'. \nDuffy follows Willie up on the platform. \nSADIE (to Jack) How'd you get him here? He was out stiff. \nJACK Hair of the dog that bit him. \nSADIE Hair? He must have swallowed the dog. \nOn the platform, Duffy looks uneasily at the bleary-eyed Willie. The band suddenly plays a fanfare, and the chairman steps up to the microphone. \nCHAIRMAN Ladies and gentlemen, it gives me a great deal of pleasure to introduce to you that true man of the people, the next governor of the state... Willie Stark. \nThere is scattered applause as Willie steps forward to speak. \nWILLIE My friends... \nHe turns his face from side to side, and fumbles in the right side of his coat pocket to fish out his speech. \nWILLIE My friends... I... \nHe tries to focus on the speech, which he clutches before his eyes with both hands. Then he lifts his head, and looks directly at the people who have come to hear him. As he speaks, the camera focuses on the faces of these people: the farmers, workers, hicks, red-necks who are Willie's audience, Willie's people. \nWILLIE I have a speech here. It's a speech about what this state needs. There's no need in my telling you what this state needs. You are the state and you know what you need... You over there... look at your pants. Have they got holes in the knees? Listen to your stomach. Did you ever hear it rumble from hunger?... And you, what about your crops? Did they ever rot in the field because the road was so bad you couldn't get them to market?... And you. What about your kids? Are they growing up ignorant as dirt, ignorant as you, 'cause there's no school for them?... No, I'm not going to read you any speech. \nHe throws his speech away. Duffy looks alarmed. \nWILLIE But I am going to tell you a story. It's a funny story... \nSADIE (from the steps) Hey! \nWILLIE'S VOICE ...So get ready to laugh. \nSADIE What's he up to? \nJACK Shut up! \nWILLIE Get ready to bust your sides laughing, 'cause it's sure a funny story. It's about a hick... a hick like you, if you please. Yeah, like you. He grew up on the dirt roads and gully washes of a farm. He knew what it was to get up before dawn and get feed and slop and milk before breakfast... and then set out before sunup and walk six miles to a one-room, slab- sided schoolhouse. Oh, this hick knew what it was to be a hick, all right. He figured if he was going to get anything done, he had to do it himself. So he sat up nights and studied books. He studied law because he thought he might be able to change things some... for himself, and for folks like him. \nSugar Boy listens intently, sharing in the anger in Willie's speech. \nWILLIE No, I'm not going to lie to you. He didn't start off thinking about the hicks and all the wonderful things he was going to do for them. No. No, he started off thinking of number one. But something came to him on the way. How he could do nothing for himself without the help of the people. That's what came to him. And it also came to him, with the powerful force of God's own lightning, back in his home country, when a schoolhouse collapsed because it was built of politics... rotten brick. It killed and mangled a dozen kids. But you know that story. The people were his friends because he fought that rotten brick. And some of the politicians down in the city, they knew that... So they rode up to his house in a big, fine, shiny car and said as how they wanted him to run for governor... \nJack, electrified, grips Sadie's arm. \nJACK Sadie, he's wonderful... wonderful... \nDuffy fidgets as Willie continues to pace and speak, his face filled with conviction, and with fury. \nWILLIE ...So they told the hick... and he swallowed it. He looked in his heart and he thought in all humility how he'd like to try and change things. He was just a country boy who thought that even the plainest, poorest man can be governor if his fellow citizens find he's got the stuff for the job. Well, those fellows in the striped pants... they saw the hick and they took him in. \nHe points his finger at Duffy, who is coming over to speak to him. \nDUFFY (low voice) Willie, what are you trying to do? \nWillie turns on him, roaring. \nWILLIE There he is! There's your Judas Iscariot. (he pushes Duffy across the platform) Look at him... lickspittle... nose- wiper. \nDuffy gestures frantically to the band. \nDUFFY Play! Play! \nWILLIE (pushing him again) Look at him! \nDUFFY Play anything. \nThe band starts to play, adding to the pandemonium. Willie shouts above it. \nWILLIE Look at him! Joe Harrison's dummy! Look at him! \nHARRISON WINS CLOSE RACE STARK SWEEPS RURAL AREAS CITY VOTE DECIDES ELECTION \nSuperimposed over newspaper is a crowd cheering at Harrison's victory parade. Willie, raincoat thrown over his shoulders, looking grim, and Sadie and Sugar Boy are part of that crowd. They turn away and walk toward a bar. \nInterior: Bar, Day \nJack is already at the bar. Willie, Sadie, and Sugar Boy join him there. \nJACK We didn't do so good. \nWILLIE Double bourbon. \nSADIE (sitting next to Jack) Same for me. \nWILLIE And a beer. (to Jack) I hear you got fired from the paper. \nJACK You heard wrong, Willie. I quit. \nWILLIE (passing the beer back to Sugar Boy) You're smart. 'Cause before I'm through with that mob they're not going to have enough money left to pay the boy that cleans the spittoons. \nJACK How do you feel, Willie? \nWILLIE I feel fine, fine. You see, Jack, I learned something. \nWillie and Sadie exchange looks. \nJACK Yeah... what? \nClose shot of Willie. \nWILLIE How to win. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nExterior: Road, Day \nJack stands on the side of the road, thumbing a ride. \nJACK (voice over) I didn't see Willie again until his second campaign... four years later. \nInterior: Office, Night \nJack turns in some copy to a man at a desk. \nJACK (voice over) I drifted from job to job... \nExterior: Street, Day \nJack and others in front of an employment agency. \nJACK (voice over) ...That is, whenever I could find one. \nInterior: Bar, Night \nJack, at the bar, looking haggard and disheveled, picks up a newspaper and turns to find a photograph of Anne. The caption reads STANTONS ARRIVE HOME. \nJACK (voice over) But always further and further away from Anne, and the life at Burden's Landing. \nExterior: Street, Day \nCamera pans with Jack as he trudges along the street. \nJACK (voice over) But Willie wasn't drifting. He knew where he was going. \nWe see an insert of a newspaper. It has a caricature of Willie, swinging a sledge hammer. The caption reads \nSTARK ATTACKS ADMINISTRATION CHARGES OLD MACHINE STILL CORRUPT \nJACK (voice over) He had his foot in the door and he kept right on pushing to get in. He had lost the election but he had won the state... and he knew it... and the people knew it. \nMONTAGE: WILLIE'S LIFE \nWriting on a fence: THE PEOPLE'S WILL SHOULD BE THE LAW OF THE STATE... WILLIE STARK Painted on a rock: KNOWLEDGE BELONGS TO THE PEOPLE... WILLIE STARK \nLettering on a barn: FREE MEDICINE FOR ALL PEOPLE -- NOT AS A CHARITY BUT AS A RIGHT... WILLIE STARK \nPoster on a building: MY STUDY IS THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE... WILLIE STARK \nJACK (voice over) They were all hopping on his bandwagon... even Tiny Duffy. \nNewspaper caricature: it shows Willie on a bandwagon headed for the state capitol. Everyone is trying to climb aboard. Caption is THEY'RE ALL FOR WILLIE NOW. Huge poster on the side of a building: MY STUDY IS THE HEART OF THE PEOPLE. Camera pans up to photograph of Willie on the poster. \nJACK (voice over) Yep, Willie came back like he said he would. \nInterior: Willie's Office, Day \nWILLIE That's the object. Not like when they beat up my boy Tom. \nJACK How is Tom? \nWILLIE Oh, he's fine. He starts college in the fall. \nJACK Oh. And Lucy? \nWillie's expression changes. He starts up the stairs. \nWILLIE Fine... fine. \nInterior: Willie's Campaign Office In Hotel, Day \nThe place is a beehive of activity, with typists and messengers scurrying about, all supervised by Sadie. \nSADIE Hey, I need a boy... Where's a boy? (boy runs up) Take that downstairs; they're waiting for it. Right away, on the double. (to typist) Listen, baby, you've got to double- space all of this... he can't read, see. \nThe door opens and Willie, Jack, and Sugar Boy come in. \nJACK Sadie! \nSADIE (to typist) And they need four copies. (looks up) Hi, Jack. How are you? \nWILLIE Sadie is my secretary now. (to messenger, trying to squeeze by) Oh, pardon me. \nAs Willie and Jack walk toward adjoining room, Sadie calls out: \nSADIE Fix your tie, Willie. \nInterior: Bedroom Hotel Suite, Day \nWillie and Jack enter from the office. \nWILLIE Hey, Sugar. \nSugar Boy appears in the doorway. Sadie slips by into the room. \nWILLIE Keep everybody out of here. I want to talk to Jack and Sadie alone. \nHe walks over to Jack, who leans back on the bed. \nWILLIE From now on you're working for me. \nJACK Doing what? \nWILLIE I don't know. Something will turn up, won't it, Sadie? \nSADIE Yeah. We need a college man around... for research. \nWILLIE How much did they pay you on that newspaper? \nJACK Three hundred dollars a month. \nWILLIE (laughs) I could buy you cheap, couldn't I? \nJACK For a bag of salt. \nWILLIE No. No, I don't play that way. I like you, boy. I always have. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll give you four hundred dollars a month and traveling expenses. \nJACK You throw money around like it was money. \nWillie gets up and walks to the window. \nWILLIE Money?... I don't need money. People give me things. \nJACK Why? \nWILLIE Because they believe in me. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Burden's Landing, Day \nWillie's car is on the ferry crossing the bay to Burden's Landing. Sugar Boy drives the car off the ferry and up the road toward the house. \nJACK (voice over) I was going home again. But this time it was different. Now I had a feeling that maybe the waiting was over... for me, and for Anne. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Stanton Living Room (Burden's Landing), Night \nClose shot of Willie standing in front of the fireplace, beneath the portrait of Governor Stanton. \nWILLIE It's a far cry from where I come from... to this house. \nCamera pulls back. The room is crowded with people, all of them friends of the Stantons. Anne, Adam, Judge Stanton, Mrs. Burden, and McEvoy are part of the audience sitting around the fireplace. Jack stands next to Willie. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Street Outside Willie's Hotel Balcony, Night \nA crowd stands below Willie's hotel window, chanting together: \nCROWD We want Willie! We want Willie! \nA high angle from the balcony shows Anne, Jack, and Adam in the center of the excited crowd, looking expectantly upward. Some of the people around them are carrying torches. Arc lights play over the dome of the state capitol in the background. In response to the chants, Willie appears on the balcony. With him, standing on the balcony, are Tom and Lucy. The crowd erupts into cheers as he steps outside. \nWILLIE (raises his hands for silence) This is not a time for speechmaking. I should get on my knees and ask God to give me strength to carry out your will. \nLoud cheers. Adam watches Anne. She applauds. Willie looks down at the crowd and continues his speech. \nWILLIE This much I swear to you. These things you shall have. I'm going to build a hospital. The biggest that money can buy... and it will belong to you. That any man, woman, or child who is sick or in pain can go through those doors and know that everything will be done for them that man can do. To heal sickness. To ease pain. Free. Not as a charity, but as a right. And it is your right that every child shall have a complete education. That any man who produces anything can take it to market without paying toll. And no poor man's land or farm can be taxed or taken away from him. And it is the right of the people that they will not be deprived of hope... \nThe crowd applauds, and Willie waves. We see Anne, face aglow, turn to Jack. \nANNE Does he mean it, Jack? Does he? \nSTANTON (as he walks away) That's his bribe. \nAnne and Jack watch Adam as he leaves. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nMontage: Willie Becomes Governor \nWillie, Sadie, and Jack leaving their old campaign headquarters. \nWillie, Sadie, Jack, and others going upstairs in the governor's mansion. The ousted politicians are just packing up and leaving. \nJACK (voice over) What if it was his bribe! He swept the old gang out of office. What if they hollered like stuck pigs? He jammed through bill after bill and the people got what they wanted. \nWillie yelling at the legislators during a session. \nWILLIE I demand that this bill be passed. Nobody's going to tell me how to run this state. \nRoad excavation -- a bulldozer clears away dirt. \nA huge crane maneuvers over a dam site. Men are seen working on the girders of a large power plant. \nJACK (voice over) He started to build the roads, the schools, the power dams, to change the face of the state from one end to the other... His methods? \nShots of uniformed policemen roughing up citizens. Willie and Sugar Boy move in on a man being held by cops. \nWillie looks on as Jack thumbs through his little black book. \nJACK (voice over) Politics is a dirty game... and he played it rough and dirty. Willie's little black book was a record of sin and corruption. And me, Jack Burden? I kept the book and added up the accounts. \nWillie in a nightclub, surrounded by some show girls. A photographer takes a picture of Willie with a girl balanced on his knee. \nWillie leads a marching band out onto a football field. \nJACK (voice over) Clown, show-off, playboy, they yelled at him. Building football stadiums. Fiercely proud of his son who played in them. \nShot of Tom in football uniform running across the field with the ball. Willie, in the stands, hugs Lucy. \nWILLIE Oh, look at him go. He's going to be All-American. \nWillie makes an inspection of the police. He stops to adjust an officer's tie. \nJACK (voice over) They said he was building up a private army. But he was building, always building... \nSign at building excavation reads HERE ON THIS SITE WILL BE ERECTED THE GOVERNOR STARK HOSPITAL -- \"TO HEAL SICKNESS. TO EASE PAIN. FREE. NOT AS A CHARITY -- BUT AS A RIGHT\"... WILLIE STARK. \nJACK (voice over) Always playing up to the crowd. Letting them trample on tradition. Well, tradition needed trampling on. \nA square dance at the governor's mansion. Willie dances with Anne. \nJACK (voice over) The crowd loved it... Willie loved it... and so did I. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nInterior: Executive Office Corridor, Day \nJack walks down the corridor on the way to Willie's offices. \nInterior: Willie's Executive Offices, Day \nAs Jack enters from the corridor, Sadie is coming out of Willie's private office. \nSADIE (through open door) You low-down, no-good redneck... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Stark's Hotel Suite, Night \nClose shot of Willie, seated, with his feet propped up on a table. Pillsbury stands before him. Jack, Sadie, Duffy, and Sugar Boy are also in the room. \nWILLIE Look at you, Pillsbury. Fifty years old, gut-sprung, teeth gone, never had a dime. If the Almighty had intended for you to be rich he'd have taken care of that a long time ago. The idea of you being rich... that's plain blasphemy. Ain't that a fact? \nPillsbury doesn't answer. \nWILLIE Answer me! \nPILLSBURY Yes. \nWILLIE Louder, man. Don't mumble. Speak up. Say it's a fact, a blasphemous fact. \nPILLSBURY It's a fact, a blasphemous fact. \nSugar Boy laughs loudly. The phone rings and Sadie picks it up. \nSADIE Yeah?... Oh, I see. (hangs up) Dumond can't come. He says his wife is sick. \nWILLIE I don't care if she's dying. Sugar, get the car. Get him and bring him over here. \nSugar Boy exists. Willie turns back to Pillsbury. \nWILLIE Now, you know what you're supposed to do, don't you, Pillsbury? You're supposed to stay poor and take orders. Oh, there'll be some sweetening for you from time to time... but Duffy'll take care of that. Don't you go setting yourself up on your own again, do you understand that? \nPILLSBURY Yes. \nWILLIE Louder, man. And say, I understand that. \nPILLSBURY I understand that. \nWILLIE Give him a pen and some paper, Sadie. \nThere is a knock on the door. \nWILLIE See who that is, Duffy. \nJudge Stanton enters. \nWILLIE Oh, hello, Judge. Sit down. I'll be with you in just a couple of seconds. (back to Pillsbury) Now write what I tell you to write... Dear Governor Stark. I wish to resign as auditor due to ill health, to take effect as soon as you can relieve me. Respectfully yours. (after a pause) Did you sign it? \nPILLSBURY No. \nWILLIE (roaring) Well, sign it! Don't put any date on it. I can fill that in when I need it. \nPillsbury signs the paper. \nWILLIE Now bring it to me. \nPillsbury moves slowly, so Sadie yanks the paper out of his hand and passes it to Willie. \nWILLIE Now get out. \nPillsbury slinks out of the room. \nJUDGE The papers have the story. \nWILLIE Yeah, I know. \nJUDGE They're talking about impeachment proceedings. \nWILLIE (rising) Against who? \nJUDGE This time, Pillsbury. \nWILLIE I got that \"this time,\" Judge. \nJUDGE How true is it? \nWILLIE It's too true. \nThe phone rings. \nSADIE Yes? (hands phone to Willie) This is it, Willie. Jeff Hopkins on the wire. \nWillie takes the phone, but puts his hand over the mouthpiece so that he can speak to Jack. \nWILLIE What have we got on Hopkins, Jack? (as Jack riffles through the black book) Hello, Jeff. About that Pillsbury business... (reads from black book Jack holds out for him) Here's what I want you to do when it comes up in the legislature. Now, wait a minute, wait a minute. You listen to me. (still reading from book) You got a mortgage coming due on that place of yours in about five weeks, haven't you? You'd like to get it renewed, wouldn't you? (pause) All right, Tiny'll talk to you in the morning. \nHe grins and hangs up the phone. \nWILLIE Get going, Tiny. \nDuffy leaves. \nWILLIE Sugar, meet me at the hotel as soon as you can. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nNEWSPAPER HEADLINE \nATTORNEY GENERAL RESIGNS: STANTON ACCUSES STARK OF QUASHING PILLSBURY GRAFT \nInterior: State Legislature Assembly Room, Day \nDuffy stands in the forground, looking in on the uproar and confusion of the assembly. \nSENATOR These are serious charges that Judge Stanton has given to the press. This legislature is entitled to a complete and full report on the Pillsbury affair. Let the truth be known. \n2ND SENATOR Let it come out. \n3RD SENATOR I move that we adjourn. \n4TH SENATOR I second the motion. \nCHAIRMAN All those in favor, say aye... Motion carried.

The speaker is beaten up. Jack Burden turns through the pages of the little black book. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Stark's Hotel Suite, Day \nWillie is lying on the bed. Jack is seated. Sadie and Sugar Boy stand nearby. \nJACK But we beat the Pillsbury rap... It's over. \nWILLIE These things are never over. I'll tell you what I want you to do, Jack. I want you to start a new page in that black book of yours... under then name of Judge Stanton. \nJACK You're crazy. There's nothing on the Judge. \nSADIE Why? Because his name is Stanton? \nWILLIE Ssshhh, easy. \nJACK What if I won't do it? \nWILLIE You know, some of this has rubbed off on you. \nJACK What are you going to do? Have me shot? \nWILLIE No... no... but I'll have to get myself a new boy. \nJACK I tell you there's nothing on the Judge. \nWILLIE Jack, there's something on everybody. Man is conceived in sin and born in corruption. \nJACK It's a waste of time. \nWILLIE What's the matter, Jack? Are you afraid you might find something out? \nJack stares at him. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Burden's Landing Ferry, Night \nJack's car is seen coming across on the ferry. \nJACK (voice over) I kept saying to myself that Willie was wrong about the Judge. If there was anything left at Burden's Landing, it was honor. I had to believe that. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Stanton Living Room, Night \nJack and Anne stand together in the living room. \nFADE IN: \nNEWSPAPER \nPhotograph of Helene Hale on front page.

Have you a statement to make? \nWILLIE All right, all right, gentlemen. I'll give you a statement. This whole thing is a mess of lies. It's a frame. The man that made that statement... have him repeat it to my face. He can't. He vanished. Let me ask you some questions. Where has he gone? Where is he? \nREPORTER Maybe you could answer those questions too, Governor. \nSugar Boy makes a move for the reporter but Willie holds him back. \nWILLIE I won't dignify that question with an answer. \nANOTHER REPORTER One more question, Governor... Where's your son? \nWILLIE At the football stadium, where he's supposed to be. He's going to play for State University, which this administration is responsible for. He's not hiding from anybody, gentlemen. He'll be out there in full view of seventy thousand cheering fans. (starts down the stairs) One of which will be me. See you, men. \nHe leaves, followed by Jack and Sugar Boy. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Football Field, Day \nThe game is in progress and the stands are packed. But there is no cheering. Instead we hear boos, and shouts for Tom. \nCROWD VOICES Where's Stark? How about Tommy Stark? Hey, Willie, send your boy in. \nExterior: Willie's Box \nWillie, Jack, Sugar Boy, and Lucy are in one box. Sadie and Duffy sit in the adjoining one. Willie is standing up. The crowd continues to heckle him. \nWILLIE Why don't they put him in! \nMAN Come on, Willie... send your boy in. \nA drunk comes over to his box. \nDRUNK What's the matter, Willie... is your little boy ashamed to show his face? \nDUFFY Shut up! \nWillie signals angrily to the police. \nWILLIE Get that man out of here! Come on, get him out of here. \nThe man is dragged away. The crowd boos, and Willie gets up and leaves the box, followed by Jack. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Stadium Dressing Room, Day \nTom is sitting on one of the massage tables with a towel around his shoulders as Willie and Jack come in. The sound of the boos can still be heard. \nWILLIE They're booing you. \nTOM (holds his head) Ever since the accident, my head... \nWILLIE The doctor said it was nothing. \nTOM Get dizzy... can't see... dizzy... \nWILLIE You're scared... plain scared. \nTOM (looks up angrily) Get out of here! \nWILLIE Atta boy... get mad. Show some spirit. Jack, tell him what his playing means. Go on, tell him. \nJACK You can never tell about a head injury. Maybe the boy's hurt. \nWILLIE He's hurt? I'm hurt. It wasn't me that wrapped that car around the tree. It wasn't me that got drunk. But me, I'm takin' the rap. (softer, to Tom) Go on, kid. Get out there and play. Show 'em the kind of stuff a Stark is made of. \nTOM (coldly) I wouldn't know. \nSTANTON Yes. \nThey leave together. \nWILLIE (to Jack) How much does the doc know? \nJACK About what? \nWILLIE Oh, you know what I'm talking about. \nJACK About what? \nWILLIE About Anne and me. \nJACK (after a pause) He doesn't know a thing... not a thing. \nJack turns and walks away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Hospital, Night \nAnne has been waiting outside the hospital. She turns to Jack as he comes out the door. \nANNE Jack, how is he? \nJACK The boy? \nANNE Yes. \nJACK He'll live. \nANNE Oh, thank God. How is -- \nJACK Willie? \nANNE He blames himself, doesn't he? \nJACK (as he walks down the street) He'll find someone else to blame in a few days. \nANNE (following him) Oh, I tried to call here at the hospital, but I just... \nThey walk together, along the waterfront. \nJACK Anne... Anne, why did you do it? \nANNE He wasn't like anybody I ever knew before. \nJACK You mean he wasn't like me. \nANNE He wasn't like anybody I ever knew before. I love him, I guess. I guess that's the reason. \nJACK Everybody loves him. \nANNE He wants to marry me. \nJACK Are you going to? \nANNE Not now. It would hurt him. A divorce would hurt his career. \nJACK His career! \nANNE Jack... Jack, what are you going to do? You can't leave him now. He needs you now more than he ever did before. \nJACK What Willie needs, Willie's got. \nANNE You don't know him. You've known him all these years and you don't really know him at all. \nJACK What about Adam? \nANNE Adam? \nJACK Well, you don't have to worry about him. If Adam finds out it'll be easy to prove a Stanton is no different than anybody else. (gives her the papers on the Judge) Just show him these. Willie was right... a man is conceived in sin and born in corruption. Even Judge Stanton. Show them to him, Anne. Change the picture of the world that Adam has in his head, just like our picture of it has been changed. \nHe grips her by the shoulders. \nJACK Wipe out everything he's ever believed in. It'll be good for him. There's no God but Willie Stark. I'm his prophet and you're his... (pushes her aside, then feels sorry and walks after her) Oh, Anne... Anne, I'm sorry. I didn't mean... Anne! \nA policeman comes over. \nPOLICEMAN What's going on here? \nJack catches up to Anne. He takes her arm and they start to walk back together. \nJACK It's all right, officer... we both work for Willie Stark. \nFADE OUT \nThe picture goes off and the lights in the room come on. \nPRODUCER How do you like it, Governor? \nWillie stands and faces the producer. \nWILLIE How many theaters will this play in? \nPRODUCER All over the country. \nWILLIE Hear that, Jack. All over the country. \nThey start to leave. Willie stops for a moment. \nWILLIE Oh, there's one thing in there I didn't like too well. That messiah or dictator. \nPRODUCER That's our point of view, Governor. And that's the way it stands. \nThere is a silence. Willie's face is hard. Then he grins. \nWILLIE All right, all right, that's the way it stands... as of now. \nFADE OUT \nFADE IN: \nNEWSPAPER HEADLINE \nSTARK BEGINS RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN STATEWIDE TOUR STARTS WITH VISIT TO KANOMA CITY \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXTERIOR: STARK FARMHOUSE, DAY \nTom and Pappy Stark are seated on the porch. Tom is in a wheelchair. Lucy comes onto the porch as the sound of sirens is heard, and Willie's two cars, motorcycle escort, and the car of reporters turn onto the drive. Tom, upset, flips his cigarette away as the cars stop in front of the porch. Lucy puts her hand on his shoulder to calm him. Then Willie climbs up the steps to greet Lucy. \nWILLIE Hello, Lucy... How are you making it, Pa?... How are you, Tom? \nTom doesn't answer. Lucy offers her cheek to Willie. Sadie, Jack, and Sugar Boy wait at the bottom of the steps, along with the reporters. \nLUCY I made some refreshments for your friends. I'll get them. \nSADIE I'll help. \nLUCY (firmly) No, thank you. Thank you kindly. \nJACK If you don't mind, Mrs. Stark... the boys have to get back to make the morning editions. (to photographers) Set 'em up on the porch, fellows. We'll take some pictures out here, first. \nHe starts arranging the family for the picture. \nJACK Mrs. Stark, please... All right, fellows, take one down there, will you please... Shoot it up this way. \nThe cameras click. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Stark Farmhouse, Night \nWillie is finishing his meal, seated at the table with his family and Jack. Sugar Boy stands behind Willie. Sadie has left the table and is examining the room. \nWILLIE (on the last bite) You're still a great cook, Lucy. Great cook. (gets up) Well, I guess I better be getting back to town. Nice to have spent the day with the family. (kisses Lucy on the forehead) Goodbye, Lucy. (extends his hand to Tom) Tom. \nTOM (ignores the gesture) Goodbye. \nWILLIE Take care of yourself, Pappy. Oh, uh... how do you like the new radio I got you? (walks over to it) You know how it works? You can get police calls on it. Come here, come here... I'll show you. \nPappy leans over as Willie demonstrates how it works. \nWILLIE This one for police calls up here. \nHe turns the dial. \nPOLICE BROADCAST Car sixty-two, proceed to five- eighteen Oak Street. Tom Jones beating his wife again. \nPappy laughs delightedly. He reaches out to turn the dial. \nWILLIE All right, go ahead, go ahead. \nANNOUNCER'S VOICE We interrupt this program to bring you a special announcement. This afternoon, the body of Richard Hale, father of the girl who died in the automobile accident involving the governor's son, was found. A medical examination revealed he was beaten to death. \nTom starts to wheel toward Willie, but Lucy restrains him. \nANNOUNCER'S VOICE The ugly charge of \"official murder\" has been hurled at the administration by a coalition of Stark's opponents, led by Judge Stanton, lately an outspoken critic of the administration. \nWILLIE (to Jack) Your friend, the Judge. \nANNOUNCER'S VOICE Thus an almost forgotten incident provided the spark that might set off the explosion needed to rock Willie Stark out of power. The latest report is that impeachment proceedings may be instituted... \nJACK You'll get your answer tomorrow. \nWILLIE Are you kidding? Did you show it to him, or didn't you? \nJUDGE Show me what? \nWILLIE That's what I figured. Let's get down to cases, Judge. Do you remember a man with the name of Littlepaugh? \nThe Judge shakes his head. He doesn't. \nWILLIE Remember the Fortune Electric Company? \nJUDGE Of course. I was their counsel for over ten years. \nWILLIE Remember how you got the job? \nJACK How did you find out? \nWILLIE (hands the Judge some papers) Do you remember how you got the job? \nThe Judge examines the papers. \nWILLIE You know, Judge, dirt's a funny thing. Some of it rubs off on everybody. How did you get the job, Judge? Blackmail? \nJUDGE (to Jack) I swear I never even remembered his name. Isn't that remarkable, Jack? I never even remembered his name. It's all so long ago it's hard for me to realize it ever happened. \nWILLIE Yeah. But it did. \nJUDGE Yes, it did. But it's difficult for me to realize it. \nJACK For me too, Judge. \nJUDGE Thanks for that much. \nWILLIE Well, I guess you know what the next move is, don't you? \nJUDGE Yes, I do. Jack Burden. Willie Stark's hatchet man. \nJACK (to Willie) I asked you... how did you find out? \nJUDGE This would never stand at law, not for a minute. It happened over twenty- five years ago, and you could never get any testimony. Everybody is dead. \nWILLIE Everybody except you, Judge. You're alive. And people think you're a certain kind of man. And you just couldn't bear for people to think otherwise. \nJUDGE Ever since then I... I've done my duty. I... I'm responsible for many good things. (looks at the papers again) But I also did this. \nWILLIE Yes, yes, you did. \nJACK Judge, I beg of you, call and release your votes, for your sake. \nJUDGE You have tender sensibilities for a hatchet man. (goes to the door) Good night, gentlemen. \nWILLIE How about my answer? \nJUDGE You'll have it in the morning. \nWILLIE I want it tonight. \nJUDGE In the morning. Good night, gentlemen. \nThere is silence. Then the three men get up to go. The Judge closes the door behind them. \nInterior: Stanton Hallway, Night \nAs the three men walk to the front door. \nJACK How did you find out? \nWILLIE We've got a lot to do. It's getting late, Jack. Let's get back to town. \nJACK You know we're through, don't you? \nWILLIE Aw, you don't mean that, boy. \nThe front door opens, and Adam and Anne come in. \nSTANTON What are you doing here? \nWILLIE It's all right, doc. Just here to discuss some politics with the Judge. \nSTANTON Oh, I see. (starts upstairs) Well, good night. \nWILLIE Good night. \nJACK (to Anne) Did you give him -- \nWILLIE Wait a minute, Jack -- \nJACK Did he tell you that too when he asked you to betray the Judge? At least I walked out on him. \nANNE Oh Jack... help me, please, please. Adam's all I've got left now. Oh, Jack, if you ever loved me... \nJACK If I ever loved you. (pause) I'll go find Adam. \nHe takes up his coat. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXTERIOR: HOSPITAL SITE, DAY \nA large billboard. It reads HERE ON THIS SITE WILL BE ERECTED THE GOVERNOR STARK HOSPITAL -- TO HEAL SICKNESS -- TO EASE PAIN -- FREE. NOT AS A CHARITY BUT AS A RIGHT. WILLIE STARK \nAdam enters, looks at the sign, and walks on. \nExterior: Street Near Capitol Building, Day \nCrowds of people headed toward the building, some with WIN WITH WILLIE signs. A marching band plays music for them. \nExterior: Capitol Building, Day \nCrowd waiting outside the building. Mounted policemen keep them in line. From a large platform, loaded with people, comes the chant \"We want Willie, we want Willie.\" Jack pushes his way through the people and speaks to a policeman standing guard on the Capitol steps. \nCOP Where do you think you're going? (recognizes Jack) Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't recognize you. \nJACK Do you know who Dr. Stanton is? \nCOP Yes sir. \nJACK Did he try to come through here today? \nCOP Haven't seen him, sir. \nJACK Well, can you check the other entrances? \n2ND COP There's no other entrances today. The other entrances are blocked off. Orders are to take no chances. \nCOP If you care to come inside and wait, Mr. Burden, we can find you a seat. \nJACK No, thanks. I'll wait out here. If Dr. Stanton shows up, let me know. Pass the word along to the boys, will you? \nCOP Yes sir. \nJack turns and looks at the large crowd. A voice from a public address loudspeaker begins to yell out commands to the crowd. \nLOUDSPEAKER All right now. Everybody... that means everybody... let's let Willie know we're here! All together: WE WANT WILLIE. WE WANT WILLIE. \nThe chant is picked up enthusiastically by the crowd. \nInterior: State Legislature, Day \nThe speaker is trying to speak over the clamor of the chanting. \nSPEAKER We will first proceed to take the judgment of the senate on the question of the impeachment of the governor. \nSENATOR (rising) Mr. Speaker, this is a farce to ask us to vote in the face of the kind of intimidation and pressure that has been exerted here in the past few weeks. Even that crowd outside, yelling on cue, is part of that pressure. \nCROWD NOISE We want Willie. We want Willie. \nWillie gets up, and goes to the window. \nExterior: State Capitol, Day \nThe crowd, with Jack in the foreground. The crowd suddenly goes wild as they see Willie appear at the window. In the growing darkness he seems only a shadowy figure as he raises his hands to wave to the crowd. \nWe see various shots of people straining to get a little closer to the steps in order to see him better. Willie then turns and goes back into the room. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: State Capitol, Day \nThe crowd again, still waiting. The camera pans upward to a loudspeaker. \nANNOUNCER Attention, please. Attention, please. This is a special announcement from Willie Stark to you people out there. He doesn't want any one of you to leave... \nThe camera moves over the faces of the people listening. \nANNOUNCER He wants you to stay in front of this state Capitol until the fight is over. If you want Willie Stark to win, stay where you are. \nThey cheer. Camera picks up Jack watching the crowd's reaction, then up to a plaque over the entrance to the Capitol Building. It reads THE PEOPLE'S WILL IS THE LAW OF THIS STATE -- GOVERNOR STARK. \nANNOUNCER Do you hear me... stay where you are. Don't go away. Stay where you are. Don't go away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: State Capitol, Night \n", "test1_input": "JACK At any price. \nSTANTON Do you really believe that, Jack? \nJACK I really believe that Stark wants to do good. You do too. It's a matter of method. Many times out of evil comes good. Well, pain is an evil. As a doctor you should know that. \nSTANTON Pain is an evil; it is not evil. It is not evil in itself. Stark is evil. \nJACK The people of the state don't think so. \nSTANTON How would they know? The first thing he did was to take over the newspapers and the radio stations. Why be so afraid of criticism? If Stark is interested in doing good, he should also be interested in the truth. I don't see how you can separate the two. No, Stark is not for me. \nANNE (upset) No, Stark is not for you. Well, what is for you? Pride. Pride, that's all it is... foolish, stupid pride. All you've ever talked about is what you could do if... if somebody would tear down and build. All right, all right, somebody has, and he's given it to you. But he's not for you. No, he's not for you. \nShe throws down her glass and runs crying from the room. Adam goes after her. \nSTANTON Anne... Anne... \nInterior: Stanton Hallway and Stairs, Night \nAnne runs upstairs and Adam follows. The Judge comes out of his room to see what has happened, sees Jack standing at the foot of the stairs, hesitates a moment, and then goes back to his room without speaking. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: County Recorder Room, Day \nJack enters and speaks to a clerk, who then directs him to one of the files. He starts to look through the files marked MORTGAGES DEFAULTED. \nJACK (voice over) Will I find anything, Judge? Will I? I didn't find it all at once. It takes a long time to go through old courthouse records and musty deeds... a very long time. But it wasn't too hard for me. I was well trained in research, especially this kind. \nHe pulls out a file. \nJACK (voice over) I found what I didn't want to find. \nHe takes the file back to the clerk. \nJACK Have some photostat copies made of these. I'll be back tomorrow for them. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Jack's Hotel Bedroom, Day \nJack is lying on his bed, looking over the documents that relate to the Judge. He looks haggard and worried. There is a knock on the door. Jack doesn't answer; the knock is repeated. \nJACK Who is it? \nSADIE'S VOICE It's me, Sadie Burke. \nJACK Wait a minute. \nHe hides the documents under his pillow. \nJACK All right, come in. \nShe comes in, sniffs the air. \nSADIE Phew! Awful lot of smoke. Awful lot of whisky. You sober? \nJACK Stone. \nSADIE I'll have one with you. (starts tidying up the room) What are you hiding out for? \nJACK I'm not. I've been sleeping. \nSADIE For four days? You've been back in town for four days. \nJACK Willie knows everything. \nSADIE Willie's worried about his boy. \nJACK Willie's boy is worried about Willie's boy. \nSADIE Well, why don't you put something on the phonograph -- a low-down, mean blues. Play it over and over again until you're sick of it. Then crack it and go back to work. (sits down) I do it all the time. \nJACK That's not my problem. \nSADIE No, it isn't your problem. (gets up again) I'll wait for you if you want to powder your nose. \nJack goes into the bathroom. \nJACK I'll be with you in a minute. \nSadie wanders around. She goes to the dresser, upon which is a photograph of Anne Stanton. She picks up the picture and places it so she can see it in the mirror and compare it with her own reflection. \nSADIE Hmmm. Yeah, I can see it. I've got to look in the mirror to be able to see it. Soft, white skin... not like mine. (runs her hand across her cheeks) I had smallpox when I was a kid. Where I lived it seemed nearly all the kids had smallpox... \nJack watches her through the open bathroom door. \n", "test1_true": "Jack, towel in hand, comes out and stands behind her. He looks at her in the mirror, puzzled. \nSADIE I see what Willie sees. Willie's got big ideas, Jack. \nJACK What do you mean? \nSADIE A girl like that could be a governor's wife. Or even a President's. \nJACK What are you talking about? \nSADIE He ditched Lucy, he ditched me, and he'll ditch you. \nJACK (shaking her) Answer me! \nSADIE He'll ditch everybody in the whole world because that's what Willie wants. Nobody in the world but him. \nJACK What are you talking about? \nSADIE You and your high-tone friends. What do they know? What do they know about anything? Why did you have to mix her in? \nJACK You're crazy, Sadie. You're out of your mind. \nSADIE Am I? Well, why don't you go down and ask her. Or ask him. Ask Willie. \nJACK Shut up! \nSADIE Go ahead, ask him. \nJACK Shut up! \nSADIE Ask him! \nHe slaps her hard. \nSADIE Ow-oo... oh... oh. \nShe starts to laugh. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Football Field, Day \nA football team is practicing on the field. Willie watches from the bench. A player kicks the ball and Tom misses it. Jack walks over to Willie. \nJACK He's off today. \nWILLIE It's only practice. He'll be all right tomorrow... You been gone a long time, Jack. \nJACK Yeah. I figured if you needed me you'd yell. \nWILLIE Why'd you lay around the hotel? \nJACK Thinking. \nWILLIE About what? \nJACK Things. \nWILLIE What did you find on the Judge? \nJACK Nothing. \nWILLIE You sure you didn't find anything on the Judge? \nJACK Yeah, I'm sure. \nWILLIE You're going to keep trying, aren't you? \nJACK If you want me to. \nWILLIE I want you to. There's something else I want you to do too. \nJACK What? Bucket boy? Towel slinger? What? \nWILLIE (looks at him closely) What's eating you, Jack? \nJACK (avoiding it) What else do you want me to do? \nWILLIE If you've got something on your mind, boy, spit it out. We've been together too long to play games. \nJACK What do you want me to do? \nWILLIE I hear your pal Adam Stanton turned down the job as director of the hospital. That's bad. Especially at a time like this. \nJACK Oh? How did you hear it? \n", "test2_input": "WILLIE Why? What difference does it make? \nJACK I just wanted to know. \nWILLIE I heard it around. \nJACK (insistent) How did you hear he turned it down, Willie? \nOut on the field the boys have stopped playing and are huddled around the coach. \nWILLIE I'll be right back, Jack. I want to see what's happening here. \nHe goes over to the group on the field. The coach is talking to Tom. \nCOACH You going to practice the way I tell you. \nTOM I'm going to do it the way I want to do it. \nWillie comes up to them. \nWILLIE Tom, come here. What's going on here? \nCOACH I don't care if he is your son, Governor... No special rules for him. \nTOM It doesn't make any difference to me either way... whether I play or not. \nWILLIE Well, it does to me. (to coach) What do you want him to do? \nCOACH To behave himself. Like the rest of the boys. Four times this season he's broken training. He comes on the practice field half potted. \nWILLIE Tom, you're going to have to obey the rules. Do you hear me? You're going to obey the rules. \nTOM I put 'em across, don't I? Every Saturday I put 'em across and I can still do it, drunk or sober. That's all you want, isn't it... for me to put 'em across so you can big-shot it around? Isn't that all you want? \nHe walks away. \nWILLIE Tom! (to coach) He's a little high-strung. (goes after Tom) Tom, come here. Tom! \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Highway, Foggy Day \nSign in foreground reads: WILLIE STARK HIGHWAY U.S. 56. A car swerves around a bend and careens down the highway. \nTom and his girl friend Helene are in the car. Tom is drinking. \nHELENE (laughing) Come on, Tommy... let's go faster. Come on... \nThe car goes across a bridge, weaving. Two motorcycle cops parked there start to give chase. \nTom's car swerves out of control and crashes through a fence. \nThe two motorcycle cops ride out to the field to the wrecked car. They find Tom and Helene, unconscious. One of the cops picks up the empty bottle and hands it to the other. \n2ND COP (looking at Tom) It's the governor's son. \nHe throws the bottle away. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nNEWSPAPER HEADLINES \nGOVERNOR'S SON HURT: GIRL NEAR DEATH IN CRASH \nBelow the headline is a picture of Helene Hale's father.

Jack, Sugar Boy, and Duffy stand around in the background. \nLUCY Willie, Mr. Hale's here to see you. \nWillie comes to meet them, a drink in his hand. He is obviously drunk. \nWILLIE Go on upstairs, Lucy. I have some business I want to talk over with Mr. Hale. \nHALE What I've got to say anybody can listen to... Where's your boy? \nWILLIE Now... now, don't get excited. (to Sugar Boy) Get me another drink, Sugar. \nHALE My daughter may die. \nWILLIE She's not going to die. She'll get the best medical attention there is. No expense will be spared. \n", "test2_true": "LUCY I'll get him. \nWILLIE Wait a minute, Lucy. He's asleep. And the doctor said after a good night's sleep he'll be all right. \nLUCY No, he won't be all right unless you make him all right. I'll get him. \nShe goes. \nWILLIE Lucy! (to Hale) You care for a drink? \nHALE No thanks. \nWILLIE Accidents will happen, you know. \nHALE Accidents? Your boy was drunk. \nWILLIE I saw the police report. There... there was nothing about drunkenness on the police report. \nHALE Whose police and whose report? I say the boy was drunk. And I know it. \nTom comes down the stairs, with Lucy. \nHALE (to Tom) Right here before your father... I want you -- \nTOM Mr. Hale -- \nWILLIE Tom, the doctor says you need rest, boy. \nTOM (turns on him) I don't want you to try to cover up for me. I was wrong... that's all there is to it. \nWILLIE You don't know what you're talking about. I saw the police report -- \nTOM I don't care what the police report says. I was driving and I was drunk. It's all my fault. (to Hale) Anything you want to do to me, you can do. Whatever you want me to do, I'll do. \nWILLIE Nobody has to do anything. Stop worrying. I'll take care of everything. \nTOM I don't want you to take care of anything. \nTom looks ill; he presses his hand to his forehead. \nWILLIE Tom, go on upstairs and get some rest, boy. Go on... go on... go on. \nTom walks slowly toward the stairs. \nWILLIE Sugar, help him... Mr. Hale, come on over and sit down. You sure you wouldn't care for a drink, Mr. Hale? \nHale sits down, shakes his head. \nWILLIE Hey, Tiny, go home. Go on, out of here... out of here. Go on. \nDuffy leaves, disgruntled. Willie sits on a coffee table. He pours himself another drink. \nWILLIE What business did you say you were in? \nHALE I didn't say. \nWILLIE What business are you in? \nHALE Trucking business. \nWILLIE Trucking business. Trucks run on state roads. If a man in the trucking business had a contract with the state, a big one, that would be pretty good, wouldn't it? (to Jack) Go on, Jack. Tell him what would happen. \nJack is silent. \nWILLIE Go on, tell him. \nHALE You're trying to bribe me, aren't you? \nWILLIE No, no. No, I'm not trying to bribe you. I'm... I'm only talking things over with you, that's all. \nHALE You're pretty good at talking. I remember when you first started talking. A place called Upton. You did a lot of talking then and the things you said made sense, to me and a lot of other people. I believed in you... I followed you... and I fought for you. Well, the words are still good. But you're not. (rises) And I don't believe you ever were. \nHe walks out of the room. \nWILLIE (after a pause) Sugar, follow him. Keep calling in. \nSugar goes, leaving just Jack and Willie. Willie, very drunk, tries to get up but falls against the piano. \nWILLIE (yells) Lucy!... Lucy! \nHe staggers up the long stairway. Halfway up he tumbles, groaning. Jack helps him to his feet. \nJACK I'd like Anne to see you now. I'd like Anne to see you now, you drunken sot! (drags him up the stairs) Come on. \nFADE OUT \n", "test3_input": "A huge crowd is gathered outside. Pillsbury, Sadie, and Duffy, waiting with the crowd, step forward as they see Willie's car approach. Newsmen take pictures as Willie gets out of the car. \nWILLIE (as he meets Duffy) What's the score? \nDUFFY They're lined up against you solid. They had a meeting. \nWILLIE How do you know? Were you there? \nDUFFY Me? What would I be doing there? \nWILLIE Selling me out. \nHe starts up the steps of the building. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Willie's Executive Offices, Night \nWILLIE How many votes have we got? \nSADIE (going through some files) Eleven. \nWILLIE We need twenty. \nDUFFY We might be able to dig up a few more. \nWILLIE Yeah. Do you know how? \nDUFFY No. \nWillie turns to Jack. \nWILLIE Oh, Jack. Come here. What have you got in your black book about that old friend of yours? \nJACK Who do you mean? \nWILLIE You know who I'm talking about... your old friend, the Judge. \nJACK If and when you need it. \nWILLIE If and when? I need it right now. He's got four senators wrapped up in his hip pocket. Come on, come on, boy... what have you got? \nJACK I'm going to give him a break. If he can prove it isn't true, I won't spill it. \nWILLIE I ought to bust you, Jack. \nJACK I promised two people I'd do it this way. \nWILLIE Who are they? \nJACK Myself... and someone else. It doesn't matter who. I'm going to give him a break. \nWILLIE All right, give him a break. But if you got the facts, you got the facts. The truth is sufficient... just like it says in the Bible. \nJACK That's the way it's going to be. \nWILLIE All right, boy... I'll trust you. Where are you going? \nJACK (on his way out) I'll be around. \nWillie turns to go into his private office. \nSADIE Who else do you think he promised, Willie? \nWillie shrugs. \nSADIE You'd be smart... play square with him. You're going to need people like us around. \nWILLIE (as he shuts his door) Are you sure? \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMONTAGE: THE IMPEACHMENT \nWillie's car speeding down a road. \nWillie, with Lucy and Tom seated behind him, addressing crowd. \nWillie speaking from the back of a train to a railroad station audience. \nJACK (voice over) The chips were down, and Willie knew it. He was fighting for his life. He roared across the state making one speech after another. And all of them added up to the same thing... \"It's not me they're after, it's you!\" \nClose-ups of Willie, speaking to the people. \nJACK (voice over) Willie hollered foul. Willie knew if you hollered long enough, hard enough, and loud enough, people begin to believe you. Just in case they didn't, he organized spontaneous demonstrations. \nSign on back of a car: FIGHT WITH WILLIE \n", "test3_true": "Willie talking on the telephone. Sadie listens. \nWILLIE Tell the boys to get the hicks out. Bring 'em in from the sticks, empty the pool halls. Turn 'em out. Turn the yokels out. \nMore men with WIN WITH WILLIE signs. Man directing crowd from top of bus. Other bus loads of people are seen, all of them bearing signs. \nJACK (voice over) In case anyone hollered back, he organized spontaneous slugging. Willie pulled every trick he ever knew -- and added a few more. \nCrowd looks on as two uniformed police drag a man away. Willie's car waiting. Two thugs talk things over with a man on his doorstep. \nWillie discussing matters with a man in his office. Two cops stand with him. \nWillie and Jack in the car. Sugar Boy drives. It is night. Sugar Boy drives fast, and has to swerve to avoid colliding with a truck. \nJACK Hey, Sugar! (To Willie) You'll never live to be impeached! \nWILLIE Boy, I'll live to be President... \nJack and Sugar wait in the car as Willie leans out the car window to talk to a senator. He offers the man a piece of paper. \nWILLIE I've got fourteen senators to vote against impeachment. If I win, you're out of politics. \nSENATOR (refuses to sign) I'll do whatever the Judge says. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nExterior: Highway, Night \nWillie's car, as it races down the highway. \nJACK (voice over) And always the trail led to one place...

We've got places to go. \nJack goes into the house alone. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nInterior: Judge Stanton's Study, Night \nJack and the Judge are seated opposite each other. \nJACK Judge, I beg you, as a favor to yourself, to me... call up, release your votes. \nJUDGE I made a mistake once, Jack... when I resigned. It was too easy then, just resigning, pulling out. No, Jack, I've made my choice. I have nothing more to lose. \nJACK Judge, you know what Stark is capable of. Think it over. I'll leave now. I'll come back tomorrow and we'll talk about it again. You can give me your answer then. \nThe door opens and Willie and Sugar Boy enter. \nWILLIE I can't wait until tomorrow. I'm a very impatient man. \nJACK (rising) I told you not to come in here. \nWILLIE (ignoring him) Is it true, Judge, that you're behind the impeachment proceedings? \nJUDGE Yes, it's true. \nWillie takes a seat in an easy chair. \nWILLIE I wanted to hear you say it with your own silver tongue. \nJUDGE Well, you've heard it. If that's all you came to hear you could have saved yourself a trip. \nWillie picks up a decanter off the table. \nWILLIE Mind if I pour myself a drink? How about you, Judge, will you have one? You better... You're going to need it. \nJack and Judge Stanton remain standing, silently watching Willie. \nWILLIE What'd he say, Jack? \n"}

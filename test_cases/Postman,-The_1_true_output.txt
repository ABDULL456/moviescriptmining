IDAHO Good, boy.   Get him. 
WOODY It's you or me. 
THE POSTMAN I know. 
IDAHO Finish it. 
Woody circles The Postman, until he's facing Idaho and the soldier. Woody takes a long look at The Postman, smiles. 
WOODY No harness on my back. 
As The Postman realizes what he's doing, Woody flips his knife through the air and into the soldier's throat.

As Woody rushes him, Idaho raises his GUN. 
Idaho pumps TWO ROUNDS into Woody, but the big man keeps coming. The THIRD ROUND finds his heart, puts Woody down. Dead. But not before he lands on top of Idaho. 
As Idaho struggles to get out from under Woody's massive frame, The Postman heads for the trees. 
Covered in Woody's blood, Idaho FIRES a ROUND as The Postman disappears into the woods. Idaho starts after him. 
IDAHO 
Tracking. He sees a dribble of fresh blood.   He touches it with his fingers and smiles. 
He cocks his head at MOVEMENT to his left. Smiling, hefting his pistol, Idaho moves in. More SHUFFLING.   Just ahead. He's got him now. 
IDAHO You want your St. Rose? 
There's a RUSTLE of BRUSH just before a ROAR splits the air. Idaho doesn't even have time to scream as the LION pounces down on top of him. 
25   EXT. CLIFF - DAY                                              25 
The Postman, lungs heaving, stops his climb long enough to take stock of the Army waiting on the distant river edge. 
Strength ebbing, he heaves himself up and continues climbing. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
26   EXT. WOODS (EASTERN OREGON) - NIGHT                           26 
A chilling RAIN drills down, washing across an old forest road. Covered with undergrowth and dotted with saplings, nothing's been down here in years. 
Blue-lipped and shivering, his clothes torn and soaked, The Postman trudges along. He tries to rub some warmth back into his numbed limbs, but a coughing spell wracks his body. 
(CONTINUED) 
26   CONTINUED:                                                      26 
He trudges forward, shoes heavy with freezing mud. He's made his escape, but he won't last the night if he doesn't find some shelter. 
An unnatural shape ahead, just off the road.    Square.   He cautiously pulls back a few branches. 
An old, rusted Jeep with faded    U.S. government markings. Its hood buried under the dirt    of an old mud slide. The Postman stoops to look through    the passenger side window, comes face-to-face with death.     A skeleton sits inside, the skull grinning against the    glass facing The Postman. 
But The Postman doesn't jump back. He just stares. The two heads meet halfway as The Postman's face is reflected on the glass, superimposed over the skull. 
A hypothermic shiver wracks his body. The Postman tries the door, but it won't budge. The other side of the Jeep is buried. But seeing that the windshield is partly smashed, he clears away the debris, peels back the spider- webbed safety glass and climbs inside. 
JEEP 
Pulling the glass back down, he looks almost shyly at the skeleton, like two kids about to "park" for the first time. 
THE POSTMAN Hey.   How ya doin'? 
The back of the Jeep is filled with bags marked U.S. Mail. The Postman picks up a hat off the console. Oddly respectful, he runs a finger along the band over the "Horse & Rider" emblem. 
The Postman reaches, touches the embroidered American flag patch on the skeleton's jacket shoulder. Another shiver. A moment later, The Postman is pulling the nice dry jacket off the skeleton and shoving his own arms inside. 
A sloshing sound. He pats down the jacket. Finds a liquor. He gives the skeleton a "you shouldn't have" look. But the cap won't budge. He twists, pries, bangs the neck of the steering wheel. At last it gives. He takes a long, hard swallow. The warming fire streams down his throat. 
The Postman grabs a random letter, reads it aloud.

THE POSTMAN 'Jerry Ball, Pine View.' 
He starts to open it, looks at the skeleton and shrugs. 
THE POSTMAN So, arrest me. (reading) Here's a piece of good news. Jerry's decided to go to school to get his contractor's license. 
Tossing it aside, he takes a drink, opens another.   The words are in crayon -- a child's scrawl. 
THE POSTMAN (smiles to skeleton) Little Jimmy wants his grandpa to know he lost a tooth. 
The Postman turns the envelope over in his palm. A tiny tooth falls out. The Postman considers it. This suddenly isn't so amusing. He puts it back in the envelope. 
Shoving mail sacks aside, he climbs in the back. Burrowing in, he pulls the sacks back, covering himself with a blanket of mail. Getting warmer already, he regards the skeleton a beat as the RAIN DRUMS ON the ROOF. 
27   EXT. JEEP - DAY                                              27 
Wearing the blue uniform, The Postman looks down at the fresh grave, realizes a eulogy is in order. He takes off the hat, holds it over his chest for a heartfelt moment of silence. 
THE POSTMAN Thanks for being there for me. (raising the flask) Here's to you. I consider my taxes very well spent. 
He swallows the last few drops, then sets the flask down as a headstone. What now? 
THE POSTMAN All dressed up. Nowhere to go.

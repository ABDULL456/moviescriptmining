HOLDEN You didn't get invited to the Con'? 
ALYSSA I don't do southern con's - all the chicks have that annoying drawl.  You know how hard it is nor to laugh when someone moans "Fuhhk me"? 
HOLDEN Well this sucks. (thinks) You know - both of us don't have to go. 
ALYSSA Really? 
HOLDEN Yeah.  Banky can go by himself.  It's not like we're on a panel.  It was just a signing appearance. 
ALYSSA If you come pick me up, I'll be your best friend. 
HOLDEN (beat) Where's your apartment? 
ALYSSA I'm not there.  I'm at a friend's - in the Village.  Corner of Houston and Mercer.  Number eighty six, apartment 6-D. 
HOLDEN I'll be there in half an hour. 
ALYSSA You're so easy. 
They hang up.  Holden reacts to something OC and exits quickly. 
C11. Banky points to pictures in the book.  The kid looks on. 
BANKY ...And then Black Beauty couldn't take it any longer, and he finally did some of his own mounting. 
KID (off book) Wow. 
Holden grabs Banky's arm and drags him away. 
HOLDEN What are you doing? 
BANKY (waving to kid) I think I want kids of my own one day. They're fun. 
HOLDEN Listen to me - I'm not going.  You're going to have to do this one by yourself. 
BANKY What?  Why? 
HOLDEN Alyssa's coming down for the weekend, so I want to hang out with her.  You don't need me for this. (taking his excess baggage) Meantime,  I'll take this stuff home. You can keep the filth.  I'll pick you up at nine Sunday night, alright? Don't forget to plug the Annual and don't mention the t.v. show, okay? Call me if you get bored. 
And he's gone.  Banky stands there, open-mouthed.  A check-in FLIGHT ATTENDANT comes up to him.  His name-tag reads 'Frank'. 
FLIGHT ATTENDANT Checking in, sir! 
BANKY (still watching Holden go) Hunhh! (looks at F.A.) Yeah.  But this is carry-on. 
F.A. Federal aviation security law requires me to ask if you've been given any strange gifts or parcels to carry-on since arriving at the airport today. 
BANKY (thinks) Not this trip.  But one time, when I was using curb side check-in, this sky- cap gave me a cock ring and a set of anal ben-wa balls.  I always thought that was pretty strange.  He said his name was Frank. (looks closely at him) Hey!  You're name's Frank! 
Banky storms away.  The Flight Attendant watches him go. 
F.A. Fucking kids. 
EXT APARTMENT 6-D - DAY 
Holden knocks at the door.  It opens.  A WOMAN is standing in the doorway in her bra She looks Holden up and down and smirks. 
WOMAN Let me guess - 'the right man'?

The MAINTENANCE ROBOT.    Turns, disappearing into the crowd. 
79   EXT. UNDERNEATH TRACK - CONTINUOUS                              79 
CLOSE ON a HAND. Hanging onto the track's edge. It's SPOONER. Dangling. Straining. To get another hand hold but... 
HE SLIPS. His coat ballooning. As he plummets.     Down... down...down...towards the city... 
WHEN SNAP! He's caught. By a cable net. Spooner. Grabbing onto it. Sweat, pouring down his face. He turns and sees... 
THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT 
Hurrying down a circular stairwell.    Exiting the station. 
ANGER AND DETERMINATION. Flash across Spooner's eyes. As he hoists himself up. Climbing up the net. Back to the... 
80   EXT. TRACK - CONTINUOUS                                         80

81   EXT. PLATFORM - CONTINUOUS                                      81 
...The platform. COMMUTERS. SCREAMING at the sight of him. A couple SECURITY GUARDS. Rushing towards him... 
Spooner. Getting to his feet. Shoving them out of the way as he starts running. Towards... 
THOSE SAME CIRCULAR STAIRS.    Looks over the edge and spots... 
THE MAINTENANCE ROBOT.   Down at STREET LEVEL.   Getting away. 
Spooner. Looks around. Spots a LIGHT POLE.       Paralleling the stairs. Takes a step back and... 
LEAPS OUT ONTO THE POLE. Hooking his arm around it. Sliding down like a fireman's pole. Gaining speed when THUMP! His shoes hit pavement... 
82   EXT. STREET - DAY                                               82 
The Maintenance Robot.   Turning a corner.   Down a quiet street... 
SPOONER (O.S.) Stop! 
Swivels round. SPOONER. Running up behind it. Whipping out his gun. Aiming it at the Robot's head. The Robot. Takes a step backwards... 
SPOONER I said stop! 
The Robot. SUDDENLY swinging the suitcase around. SMASHING it against Spooner's head. Spooner. Buckles. Falling to the ground. Managing to squeeze off a SHOT... 
The Robot. Deflecting the bullet. With the case.      Raising it as if to club Spooner with it when... 
BAM! Spooner fires a second shot. Piercing the Robot's breastplate. HYDRAULIC FLUID. Starting to leak. The Robot. Doesn't hesitate. SLAMS the case into Spooner's face... 
BLOOD. Spurting from Spooner's nose. As he fires the gun. At the fleeing Robot. Gets to his feet. Unsteady. Taking chase... 
83   EXT. PUBLIC PLAZA - CONTINUOUS                                  83 
...back out onto the Public Plaza.    Sees the Robot heading towards a set of... 
ESCALATED STAIRS. The Robot. Judging the height. LUNGES into the air and lands on a STAIR. Denting it. Reaches the bottom. DISAPPEARING. Into a CROWD of even more PEOPLE... 
Spooner. Racing down the stairs. Taking them. Four at a time. Hits the ground running. Looking. EVERYWHERE. Suddenly losing track. Of where the Robot went... 
Then. Catching sight. JUST AHEAD. Of a ROBOT.         Staring back at him. Holding SOMETHING. In its HAND... 
Spooner.   Plunges into the crowd.    Waving his GUN. 
SPOONER Everyone out of the way! 
SCREAMING. PEOPLE SCATTERING. As BAM! BAM! Spooner fires. Hitting the Robot in its head and back. It drops to the ground. Spooner. Racing over to it. Sees. It's not the same Robot. In its hand, a specialised SCREWDRIVER... 
OWNER What the hell do you think you're doing?!... 
Its OWNER. Rushing over. Shoving Spooner aside. But Spooner's. Not listening. Spotting. A DROP OF HYDRAULIC FLUID nearby... 
Lunges forward.   Following.    The drops.   Running faster.     And faster... 
OWNER Hey! 
...Through the CROWD. POLICE SIRENS. In the background.          As Spooner. Shoves through. Tracking those drops. Like a bloodhound. Turns... 
84   INT. ALLEYWAY - CONTINUOUS                                        84 
...into a narrow alleyway.     The drops.    Ending suddenly.    In a PUDDLE. 
Spooner. Crazed. Wounded. Exhausted. Spins around. Where is it? Where is it? Then he HEARS. A DROPLET falling. Into the puddle. Slowly. Looks up to see...

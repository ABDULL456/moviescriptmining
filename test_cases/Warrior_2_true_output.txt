Brendan pulls a garbage bin down to the curb as Tess walks out of the house talking on a cordless PHONE. 
TESS (INTO PHONE) Yeah, the girls are good. They're good. Yeah, you should. You've been spending so much time with Brendan these days it's like you're part of the family or something. Yeah, he's right here. (handing phone to Brendan) It's your boyfriend. 
BRENDAN (INTO PHONE) Hey Frank. (BEAT) That's unbelievable. I can't thank you enough. I don't know what to say. Alright, listen, I've gotta call you back. Alright, bye. 
Brendan hangs up the phone. Looks at Tess. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) I'm in. I'm going. 
A look of serious concern crosses Tess's face. She puts her hands on her hips. 
TESS Really? So that's your decision? You decided? `Cause I really enjoyed that conversation we just had about making that decision together. 
Brendan doesn't say anything. Knows she's right. And that he's about to get laid into. 
TESS (CONT'D) You told me you were gonna fight guys that watched too much UFC. I saw that Koba dude on TV, and he's the guy they're watching. 
BRENDAN It's a lot of money, Tess. 
TESS I don't give a shit about the money, Brendan. I told you that. We're gonna end up cashing in your life insurance policy before we pick up that prize money. 
BRENDAN You don't think I can do it. 
TESS I think you can get killed. 
BRENDAN I'm not gonna get killed. 
TESS Fine, you're not going to get killed. But can you promise me you're not going to get hurt? You're not gonna end up in the hospital? You're not gonna end up paralyzed? We'll have no prize money. No house. Payments for HOSPITAL BILLS-- 
BRENDAN Tess, I can promise you this: if I don't try, they're gonna take the house. How's that for a promise? 
No response from Tess, who has tears in her eyes. 
BRENDAN (CONT'D) So, I'm gonna go, OK? But I'd really love it if you'd be with me on this. 
Tess looks at her husband. Wants to support him, but can't. 
TESS I'm not gonna watch you fight again. I'm not. (BEAT) I'm gonna get the girls breakfast. 
Tess starts walking back toward the house. She marches up the lawn without turning back, leaving Brendan, alone, in front of his house. He looks at the toys strewn across the yard. Surveys the neighborhood. He's going to Sparta. 
CALLEN (V.O.) Fourth of July weekend doesn't officially start until tomorrow... 
EXT. ATLANTIC CITY - DAY 
Sunlight pours down on the crowded beaches, hotels, and boardwalks of AC. Thousands of PEOPLE jam the outside of the majestic Boardwalk Hall. It seems as if everyone on earth is in town. 
CALLEN (V.O.) ...but fight fans are already descending on Atlantic City for the Super Bowl of Mixed Martial Arts, Sparta. 
BILLBOARDS heralding the arrival of the SPARTA tournament are everywhere. Ceremonial Fourth of July banners hang, cars jam Ocean Avenue, early FIREWORKS pop. The buzz is electric. The greatest show on earth has hit the shore. 
EXT. BOARDWALK HALL ARENA - SAME 
LIMOUSINES pull up in front of the Boardwalk Hall rotunda as "Mad Dog" Grimes, Orlando "Midnight" Le, Karl "The Dane" Kruller, and other fighters make their way down a long red carpet swarming with FANS. 
In the middle of it all is J.J. Riley, greeting press and guests and running the show as the Tapout crew, Colt Boyd, and others mill about and talk shop. Announcers BRYAN CALLEN (40s) and SAM SHERIDAN (30s) corral J.J. for an interview. 
CALLEN J.J., you've made a fortune with your hedge funds, yet you turned your back on Wall Street and dedicated your life to making Sparta happen. Tell us, why is this tournament so important to you? 
J.J. RILEY Growing up, we all wanted to know who the toughest kid in the neighborhood was, right? I wanna know who the toughest man on the planet is. That's why I put this together, that's what all these people are here to see, and come Saturday night, that's what we're gonna find out. 
SHERIDAN Thank you, J.J. And here's something fans never thought they'd see: Koba is here! The legend arriving to fight on U.S. soil for the very first time... 
The great and mighty KOBA emerges from a white stretch limo, trailed by his ENTOURAGE of tough-looking RUSSIANS. FLASHBULBS pop. REPORTERS swarm. It looks like a movie premiere out there and Koba's the star.

ELLIE 
(bluffing it through) 
Will you please tell me what you're raving about! 
PETER 
You'll never get away with it, Miss Andrews. Your father'll stop you before you get half way to New York. 
ELLIE 
You must have me confused with 
PETER 
(interrupting) 
Quit kidding! It's all over the front pages, You know, I've always been curious about the kind of a girl that would marry King Westley. 
He pulls a newspaper out of his pocket and hands it to her. Ellie glances at the headline hurriedly. 
PETER 
(while she reads) 
Take my advicegrab the first bus back to Miami. That guy's a phony. 
ELLIE 
(looking up at him) 
I didn't ask for your advice. 
(she hands the paper back) 
PETER 
That's right. You didn't. 
ELLIE 
You're not going to notify my father, are you? 
PETER 
(looking at her squarely) 
What for? 
ELLIE 
If you play your cards right, you might get some money out of it. 
(a disdainful expression crosses his face) 
PETER 
I never thought of that. 
ELLIE 
(frantically) 
Listen, if you'll promise not to do it, I'll pay you. I'll pay you as much as he will. You won't gain anything by giving me away as long as I'm willing to make it worth your while. I've got to get to New York without being stopped. It's terribly important to me. I'd pay now, only the only thing I had when I jumped off the yacht was my wrist watch and I had to pawn that to get these clothes. I'll give you my address and you can get in touch with me the minute you get to New York. 
PETER 
(furious) 
Never mind. You know I had you pegged right from the start, you're the spoiled brat of a rich father. The only way you can get anything is to buy it. Now you're in a jam and all you can think of is your money. It never fails, does it? Ever hear of the word "Humility"? No, you wouldn't. I guess it never occurred to you to just say, "Please mister, I'm in trouble. Will you help me?" No; that'd bring you down off your high horse for a minute. Let me tell you something; maybe it'd take a load off your mind. You don't have to worry about me. I'm not interested in your money or your problems. You, King Westley, your father, you're all a lot of hooey to me. 
He turns his back on her and leaves. A close-up of ELLIE shows her staring after him, her eyes blazing angrily. 
In a TELEGRAPH OFFICE, Peter addresses a girl operator as he drops a telegram on the counter, which she reads. 
PETER 
(brusquely) 
You send telegrams here? 
OPERATOR 
(recognizing him apparently, sarcastically) 
I'm just fine thanks, and how are you? 
(reading) 
To "Joe Gordon, care of New York Mail, New York. Am I laughing. The biggest scoop of the year just dropped in my lap. I know where Ellen Andrews is" 
(looking up excitedly) 
No, do you really? 
PETER 
(impatiently) 
Go on. Go on send the telegram. 
OPERATOR 
"How would you like to have the story, you big tub ofof" 
PETER 
Mush. Mush. 
OPERATOR 
"Tub of mush. Well try and get it. What I said about never writing another line for you still goes. Are you burning? Peter Warne." Well, that will be $2.60. 
PETER 
Send it collect. 
OPERATOR 
Collect? 
Peter 
(firmly) 
Collect. 
As the clerk takes the wire from him, scene fades out. 
Part Three 
The BUS TERMINAL fades in. It is night now, and the rain comes down in torrents. People scurry around to get into the buses as the voice of an announcer is heard: 
ANNOUNCER'S VOICE 
Bus for blah-blah-blah-blahCharlestonblah-blah-blahand all points North to New York! 
This dissolves to the interior of a BUS, which is practically filled. Peter is in his seat, reading a magazine, while Ellie enters hurriedly from the rear door and starts forward. As she approaches Peter, she hesitates a second, and deliberately passes him, plunking herself into a seat in the opposite aisle. Peter turns just as she gets seated. He glances at her indifferently. 
A close view shows Ellie seated next to a man who sits reading a newspaper which covers his face. Her eyes are fixed forward, her lips set adamantly. A close-up of the MAN next to Ellie makes it plain that he is a typical drummer.[3] At the moment he is absorbed in a serial story, but suddenly he becomes aware of something at his feet, and without lowering the newspaper, his gaze slowly shifts downward. At this, the view moves down until it reaches Ellie's trim ankles. Her feet beat a regular tattoo on the floor; her extreme agitation is evident. The view moves back slowly, taking in Ellie's shapely leg as far as the knee. Then we see ELLIE and the DRUMMER as his gaze is still fixed on her leg. Slowly his face breaks into a lascivious grin, he lowers his paper, and turns for a scrutiny of her face. What he sees apparently delights him, for he drops his paper completelyand smiles broadly. 
DRUMMER 
Hi, sisterAll alone? My name's Shapeley. 
(Ellie favors him with a devastating look which is wasted on the drummer) 
Might as well get acquainted. It's gonna be a long tripgets tiresome later on. Specially for somebody like you. You look like you got class. 
(he surveys her from head to foot) 
Yessir! With a capital K. 
(he chuckles at his own sally) 
And I'm a guy that knows class when he sees it, believe you me. 
A close-up of ELLIE, as Shapeley's voice continues, shows her glancing back at Peter, expecting him to come to her rescue. 
SHAPELEY'S VOICE 
Ask any of the boys. They'll tell you. Shapeley sure knows how to pick 'em. Yessir. Shapeley's the name, and that's the way I like 'em. 
Ellie again looks toward Peter. But PETER seems to have found something of unusual interest in his magazine . . . and we again see the harassed ELLIE and the irrepressible SHAPELEY, who continues. 
SHAPELEY 
You made no mistake sitting next to me. 
(confidentially) 
Just between us, the kinda muggs you meet on a hop like this ain't nothing to write home to the wife about. You gotta be awful careful who you hit up with, is what I always say, and you can't be too particular, neither. Once when I was comin' through North Carolina, I got to gabbin' with a good-lookin' mama. One of those young ones, you know, and plenty classy, too. Kinda struck my fancy. You know how it is. Well, sir, you could'a knocked me over with a Mack truck. I was just warming up when she's yanked offa the bus. Who do you think she was? Huh? Might as well give up. The girl bandit! The one the papers been writin' about. 
(he pulls out a cigar, and continuesawed by the recollection) 
Yessir, you coulda knocked me over with a Mack truck. 
(he lights his cigar, takes a vigorous puff, and turns to her again) 
What's the matter, sister? You ain't sayin' much. 
ELLIE 
(intending to freeze him) 
Seems to me you're doing excellently without any assistance. 
(this however only brings a guffaw from the drummer)

STEVE (CONT'D) I despise each and every one of you! MORE SHOUTS, LAUGHTER. Steve LEAPS out into space. Perfect huge swam dive... falling... HITTING the water. A moment of silence... did he? Was that deep enough...? Steve ERUPTS out of the water. Party ROARS back into life. 
EXT. GROUNDS, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS 
High above the festivities. Bishop slips over the wall, makes his way down towards the estate. 
INT. MCKENNA ESTATE - MOMENTS LATER 
Dark and empty in here, party raging outside. Bishop enters Steve's bedroom. Messy, the bed unmade. A woman's underthings lying on the floor. Bishop surveys the room, checks drawers, peers down into the party below. He can see Steve in the middle of it all, Louise on his arm, his hand on her ass. Bishop moves to the office door, locked. He slides a pick- set out of his pocket, gets to work. 
INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT 
The door lock "clicks" and Bishop enters, closes the door after himself and locks it, turns around... The room has been STRIPPED of everything that was in here last time. GONE are the paintings, the portraits, the mementos. All traces of Harry McKenna, removed. Instead, a SINGLE desk inhabits the center of the room, a small computer monitor and keyboard centered on it. Bishop comes around, touches a key on the keyboard. The monitor glows to life with a single "PASSWORD" prompt. Bishop stares at it. He sits, staring, concentrating... 
EXT. POOL AREA, MCKENNA ESTATE - CONTINUOUS 
Steve has moved to the edge of the raised patio, looking down into the valley. His eyes still, deep, impossible to read. 
LOUISE Hey! Hey baby! Karen's got some amazing E. You need to come try... Steve turns those cool eyes on her. She shrinks. We think he might slap her, then: 
STEVE Give me a moment. I'll be right there. We'll do that amazing E. And he looks away, back down over the view. A resigned loneliness settling into his features. 
INT. OFFICE, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT (LATER) 
Bishop, just staring at the password prompt which throbs in front of him. Beat. His eyes flick across to the few books lying on the desk. Weaponry, physiology... Greek Mythology. Bishop reaches forward, types "Nemesis." Hits ENTER. A moment... and then our minds are blown. The entire wall of the room in front of Bishop glows to life. It's a one large high-resolution monitor. On it, glows an infinitely detailed work-up on Bishop. A photograph on him glows at the center of the screen, changing every three or four seconds to another. This is Bishop's method, brought into the 21st century. Accounts, Medical charts, psych profile, associates, residence... Bishop approaches... takes it in. Touches "Accounts" and the window SPREADS OUT across the whole wall. Multiple windows, all of Bishop's money, displayed in real time, the numbers subtly changing with the flow of foreign markets. Another window above is labeled "Associates." Bishop touches this one and the financial windows are replaced with a collage of FACES. Not too many. We recognize the Store Owner and his Daughter. Steve himself. An older man "Gerald Bishop," Bishop's father. And a photo of the Woman. Bishop touches the woman and multiple images propagate out from the single. Many stills, but several are in motion, looping: Childhood movies. A commercial done as a teen. A blue movie when she was 20. Bishop's eyes settle on a video image: He and the woman, caught just an hour ago in the middle of the dancing party. The woman leaning to him, kissing him. Bishop stares at the image, then touches another image labeled "Residence." INSTANTLY, the images are replaced with images of the interior and exterior of Bishop's home. Bishop stares at them, confused. SQUINTS... realizing that in one of the images, the trees lightly sway in the breeze. 
BISHOP Huh. His eyes dart to an image of his DINING ROOM. It looks like a still, until suddenly Bishops' cat passes through the frame. Bishops' eyes dart, moving from frame to frame. The whole interior of his life. His living room, bedroom, study, gym. All live feeds. 
BISHOP (CONT'D) Son of a bitch... 
INT. BEDROOM, MCKENNA ESTATE - NIGHT (LATER) 
Door BURSTS open, Steve pushing in, his arms wrapped around Louise and another gorgeous woman from the party. As the two women hit the bed, start undressing each other, Steve takes a moment -- sensing. Something not right. He pulls keys from his pocket, unlocks the study door, peers in. 
STEVE'S P.O.V.: THE STUDY - EMPTY 
LOUISE (O.S.) Come on, Steve. We need you. 
INT. DIVE BAR - NIGHT 
Low end. Mean men and loose women. Metal on the juke. Duct- taped naugahyde. Bartender on parole. Eyes raise as Bishop pushes in, scattered focus, hits the bar. 
BISHOP Whiskey. Neat. Lots of it. Bishop fumbles in his pocket, brings out a thick wad of cash. $100s and $20s. Eyes track. At a booth, two EX CONS lock onto Bishop, one sporting a middle-finger raised FU tattoo on his bare shoulder. Bishop pushes $100 forward. 
BARTENDER That's too much. Bishop grabs the shot, down it. Pushes the empty shot and the cash back at the bartender. 
BISHOP I'm not going anywhere. 
AN HOUR LATER Another shot is put down on the bar, empty. Bishop wipes watery eyes, nods to the bartender to hit it again. Bishop stares at the drink, then his attention is drawn to the bar TV. Footage from the protests in Turkey is narrated by a news anchor, speaking. 
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR ...Intelligence services can listen to our calls. But what about the rest of the world? 
(MORE) 
FEMALE NEWS ANCHOR (CONT'D) Well, today the answer seems to be 'No" as outrage over the assassination of the Turkish envoy Bahar Miryem has forced the US to reverse its position, now saying that it will not make it support of Turkey's EU bid contingent on its cooperation in the security agreement. Miryem had always advocated for Turkish autonomy from 
Bartender hits a remote, annoyed. Channel changes to a 70's Charles Bronson flick. Bishop blinks, shakes his head... He collects himself, weaves out of the bar. The Ex-Cons watch him go. 
EXT. CITY STREETS - NIGHT

My guys really need the variance, for the first floor retail. Walter is mortified. He turns away from Margaret. \nWALTER Um... we should hear from Permits by Thursday. \nFRIENDLY GUY Yeah? Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects! Pleased, the guy cheerily strides away. \nON WALTER AND MARGARET He is stricken. Something ominous just happened. \nMARGARET What was that?? \nWALTER \n(ASHAMED) I -- I didn't want you to know... A long, horrible pause. Walter's face turns gray. We SLOWLY PUSH IN. This revelation is churning. Agony. \nWALTER I'm in commercial real estate. A stunned beat. \nMARGARET You're a -- Realtor? \nWALTER \n(CONTRITE) YES! A hugely successful Realtor! Top earner in the Downtown office three years running! \nMARGARET And you're... ashamed? \nWALTER Of course! Any blockhead can arrange a sublet! \n(HEARTFELT) All I ever wanted was to support myself as an artist... \n(SAD; BEAT) I tried to make a clean break, but couldn't cut it. I'm just a goddam Sunday painter. An amateur. Margaret looks at him, touched by his vulnerability. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nEnd of the day. Golden light slants in through the windows of this small tidy apartment. The door opens. Margaret holds it for Walter, who chivalrously staggers in, carrying all her supplies: Easel, paints, cans. He carefully puts it all down -- then turns. Beat. Walter stares at Margaret, their faces caught in the warm light. Then, enchanted, he kisses her. Silence. Margaret smiles, captivated. Caught in his glow. The moment could last forever... \nIN THE DOORWAY Jane stares unhappily. Threatened. \nJANE A-hem! \nON MARGARET She turns, startled. Feeling guilty, Margaret rushes from Walter. Busying herself, she skims through the MAIL. Jane shakes her head and marches out. Margaret flips through envelopes -- until one stops her. On edge, she slowly removes an official DOCUMENT. She scans it... and her face drops. Crushed. Something terrible... Walter is worried. \nWALTER What's wrong...? \nMARGARET \n(SOFT) Frank wants to take away Jane. He says I'm an unfit mother... Walter is taken aback. \nWALTER You're a perfect mother. \nMARGARET He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. It's beyond my abilities as a single woman... Margaret trails off, shaken. Walter gulps unsurely. Then, he takes her in his arms. We \nSLOWLY PUSH IN. \nWALTER Marry me. \nMARGARET \n(SHE GASPS) Walter! I -- \nWALTER (he puts a finger to her lips) Shh. Don't think of a reason to say no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons to say yes. (he gives a winning smile) I know it makes no sense! \n(MORE) \n", "test1_true": "WALTER Margaret, I'm on my knee! C'mon, whatdya say? Let's get married! We can be in Hawaii by the weekend. \nMARGARET \"Hawaii\"? M-marriage? \n(EMOTIONAL) Walter, I'm crazy about you... but I'm overwhelmed. Why would we go to Hawaii?! \nWALTER \n(BEGUILING) Because you're a princess... and you deserve to get married in paradise. \nCLOSEUP - MARGARET Margaret shudders, tears in her eyes. Hawaiian MUSIC begins... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nSTOCK FOOTAGE - DAY A propeller-driven PAN AM airplane soars through the sky. \nEXT. HAWAII - DAY \nHawaii, 1958. Heaven on earth. Blossoming flowers, rare birds, lush greenery. Margaret is experiencing total bliss. We widen. She and Walter stand in front of a waterfall, getting married. Jane is Maid-of-Honor. A PRIEST smiles, and Walter places a ring on Margaret's finger. They kiss. \nEXT. BEACH - SUNSET \nMargaret and Walter lie on the sand, making out. Cuddling, running their fingers along each other's bodies. She stares up, endlessly happy. \nMARGARET You're right... this is paradise. Only God could make those colors. \nWALTER I knew you'd love it. \nMARGARET Oh, can't we stay here forever?? \nWALTER Well, I don't know about forever. But maybe... I can arrange another week. \nEXT. HOTEL GROUNDS - DAY \nThatched umbrellas, Polynesian fun. Margaret is set-up, drawing PORTRAITS of the GUESTS. Walter regales them as they wait. Joking, gregariously handing out Mai-Tais. Margaret finishes a picture. She beams at Walter... then signs the picture \"KEANE.\" Walter gapes, astonished at this gesture. Margaret lock eyes with him. She smiles girlishly, radiating happiness. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY \nOld school Cantonese: Dragons and red lacquer. Margaret eats lunch with Dee-Ann, showing off SNAPSHOTS from the trip. \nMARGARET This is a waterfall... the air was so fresh you could taste it. Here's an ancient altar... that statue is Kane, the god of creation. I said a prayer to him. Oh! Here's Walter and Janie, building a sandcastle -- Dee-Ann raises an eyebrow. \nDEE-ANN This is all happening mighty quick. In the time you moved here, I've had two dates. You're already married. \nMARGARET \n(SHE GIGGLES) I thought there was a void in my life. Well... Walter's filled it. \nDEE-ANN Walter's filled a lot of things. He's diddled every skirt on the art circuit. \nMARGARET You're talking about my husband! \nDEE-ANN I know! That's why I brought it up. Margaret frowns, insulted. \nMARGARET I'm not naive. (beat; she laughs) Well, I am naive. But I know the man I'm marrying. Walter can act rash... but he's a good provider. And he's wonderful with Jane. \n(CLEAR-EYED) Look -- we're both looking for a fresh start. I'm a divorcee with a child. Walter is a blessing. Dee-Ann bites her tongue. The WAITER brings over the check. Sitting on it are TWO FORTUNE COOKIES. Hm. Margaret stares, utterly serious. She reaches for one... then impulsively grabs the other. She cracks the cookie. Dee- Ann waits, curious. Margaret reads... then slowly smiles. \nMARGARET \"You are on the threshold of untold success.\" \nINT. ART GALLERY - DAY \nA Modish, happening gallery. The white walls are hung with ABSTRACT EXPRESSIONISM: Slashing angles of color, painted over rags and glued bolts. On the floor is SCULPTURE made from wood and wire. In charge is RUBEN, a fussy man in a goatee. He's schmoozing a FANCY LADY. They look at a spattered, distorted painting. \nRUBEN What's brilliant about the composition is its spontaneity. The image has no visual center of attention. \nFANCY LADY It's quite gestural. \n", "test1_id": 3, "test2_input": "EXT. PUBLIC BUILDING - DAY \nWalter thrusts a painted Ballerina at a SOVIET DIPLOMAT. \nWALTER In the interest of peace through culture, we donate this painting to the people of Russia! \nINT. PHONEBOOTH - NIGHT \nDick whispers into a phone. \nDICK The Purple Onion. 9:30. Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation. \nINT. PURPLE ONION - NIGHT \nJOAN CRAWFORD is eating with friends. Suddenly Walter lunges into view, startling her. He lugs a painting. \nWALTER Miss Crawford! In recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting, \"The Lion and the Child\"! \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \nMargaret paints. Walter beams. \nWALTER Joan said \"Marvelous\"! MARVELOUS! That's worth more than 1000 critics! (he CLAPS his hands) Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening. \nMARGARET But... isn't it strange? Artists get shown. They don't build their own galleries. \nWALTER Says who?! Like John Q. Public cares? He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism! She responds -- but he sexily puts his finger to her mouth. \nWALTER He digs real art. Your art! It's beautiful. You're beautiful... Walter starts rubbing against her, dancing sensually. She laughs, embarrassed, her wet paint brushes smearing his chest. She relents and relaxes. They dance around... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING \nIn the shadows, POSTERS of \"The Waif\" get glued up. Under her woeful face, it says \"KEANE GALLERY 494 Broadway.\" We WIDEN, as Walter, Margaret and Jane hastily slap up the posters. They carry glue buckets and a ladder. \nWALTER Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this! Little Jane tiredly glues another poster. She yawns. \nJANE I remember when Momma painted that. Huh? Suddenly, Margaret freezes. She hadn't anticipated this. Margaret looks to Walter. He stares back, waiting. \nMARGARET Are you -- sure? That was a long time ago. \nJANE Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen -- \nWALTER \n(CUTTING IN) No, dear, I'm afraid you're confused. I painted that one -- \nJANE No, Mother did! Look! I'm wearing my blue dress. \nMARGARET L-lots of girls have that dress... Margaret trails off, sickened. Not knowing how to lie. Walter takes charge. He kneels, then smiles gently at Jane. \nWALTER You have a good eye, sweetie. I painted it, but I was trying to mimic your mother's style. You know, the style she USED to paint in. \nCLOSEUP - JANE A loooooong pause. She examines the print. Then... she nods. \nJANE Well you did a really good job. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO NORTH BEACH - DAY \nCU on the Waif. We widen, revealing the ENTIRE WORLD has been hijacked, blanketed by THE POSTERS. People gape -- astonished and captivated. Disconnected from it all, strolling alone, is Margaret. She is burdened by her own thoughts. Regretful... Across the street, she sees a GOTHIC CHURCH. She stares up, awed by the beauty. It's Catholic imagery in all its glory: Saints... Jesus... Mary... Suddenly -- the bells RING. Hm. Margaret takes a step... \nINT. CHURCH CONFESSION BOOTH - DAY \nMargaret tentatively enters and kneels. Beat -- then the grille OPENS. She reacts, discomposed. \nMARGARET Hello. I've -- never really done this before. I'm not sure how you... \n", "test2_true": "She starts to stand. The Priest blurts out. \nPRIEST'S VOICE No, no! Please. We don't chase people away. \n(BEAT) What is troubling you? Margaret takes a breath. \nTHEN -- \nMARGARET I lied to my child. Pause. \nPRIEST'S VOICE Why would you do that? \nMARGARET My husband... he pressured me into doing it. \n(PAUSE) I've never lied to her before. I'm not that kind of person. Beat. \nPRIEST'S VOICE Is your husband that kind of person? \nMARGARET Ummm, no. I don't think of him that way. I mean, he likes to tell stories... maybe he exaggerates a little... but he's a good man. \n(SHE THINKS) He takes care of us. He wants to make enough money to buy our family a house... \nPRIEST'S VOICE But what of the child? Will this lie bring harm to her? \nMARGARET \"Harm\"?? Oh! Not at all. \n(BEAT) I'm just looking for answers... The Priest considers this. \nPRIEST'S VOICE Well, the modern world is a complicated place. \n(MORE) \nPRIEST'S VOICE (CONT'D) Occasionally, children need to be sheltered from certain truths. \nMARGARET N-no. That's not what -- \nPRIEST'S VOICE It sounds like your husband is trying to make the best of an imperfect situation. \n(BEAT) You were raised Christian, so you know what we are taught: The man is head of the household. \n(BEAT) Perhaps you should trust his judgment. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT \nOpening night! The gallery is packed with the IN CROWD: Rich and drinking. The space is cool -- the walls bright white, the art hanging under spotlights. JAZZ plays on the stereo. At one painting, a HIPSTER COUPLE stares at the image of a sorrowful girl holding an armful of poodle puppies. \nHIPSTER LADY I think it's creepy, maudlin and amateurish. \nHIPSTER MAN Exactly. I love it. We move in tight on the painting. Underneath is a tag: \"BEDTIME, by WALTER KEANE. Oil on canvas.\" We drift along, to another painting: \"CALICO CAT, by WALTER KEANE.\" Then, another: \"IN THE GARDEN, by WALTER KEANE.\" Every painting is now by Walter Keane. We move along... finding the Tipsy Man chatting up Dick. \nTIPSY MAN We got in early. We own three. \n(HE TURNS) Thanks, doll. He tosses his empty to a PASSING LADY. We reveal the waitress is... Margaret. She carries a tray of pigs-in-a-blanket. Margaret looks shell-shocked -- faking a happy party face. A burst of LAUGHTER. Margaret turns. \nWalter and a group ROAR at a joke. A SEXY GIRL hands Walter one of the promo posters. He beams and lays it across her back... hugging her waist to \"steady\" himself as he signs. \nBACK ON MARGARET She frowns. Dee-Ann slides into view, slurping champagne. \nDEE-ANN Hey, baby! Killer party! It's a hap- pen-ing...! So, where's your stuff? \nMARGARET \n(NERVOUS) Oh. Um, we decided that this would be Walter's show -- \nDEE-ANN \n(SUSPICIOUS) Oh \"we\" did?? And why would \"we\" do that?? \n", "test2_id": 4, "test3_input": "(CUTTING) Maybe you need to make some. \nMARGARET Y-you know I can't have people over to the house. \nJANE That's right! Or they'd see the precious paintings!! \nMargaret has no response. Jane runs off. \nINT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY \nMargaret is alone, pouring a drink. She mixes in some ice -- then sees something odd. \nOUTSIDE THE WINDOW Coming down the long driveway are two FIGURES. Two small WOMEN, patiently walking toward the isolated house. Margaret stares, puzzled. The women come closer. They are Asian, dressed in formal dresses. Curious, Margaret creeps over, spying on them... They walk up and ring the bell. DING-DONG! An unsure beat... then Margaret opens the door. The ladies smile politely. \nASIAN LADY #1 Hello. We're visiting everyone in this neighborhood with an important message. No doubt you're busy, so we'll be brief. Huh? Margaret stares at them deadpan, highball in her hand. \nASIAN LADY #2 We have something to share with you about the wonderful things that God's Kingdom will do for mankind. Margaret's face darkens. \nMARGARET I'm not interested. She starts to close the door... but they continue. \nASIAN LADY #1 Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or in religion in general? \nMARGARET I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. The lady glances at Margaret's glass. She smiles gently. \nASIAN LADY #2 But we're not selling anything. We're just here to share the good news. \nMARGARET \n(DOUR) From where I'm standing, I don't see much good anywhere. Just a lot of pride, and thievery, and people treating each other poorly. \nASIAN LADY #2 Yes! Exactly! That is the good news! What? Margaret is lost. The ladies grab the opening. \nASIAN LADY #1 Bad things in the world are a sign. They show us that earthly Paradise is at hand. \nASIAN LADY #2 Do you know what it says in Timothy \n(she pulls out a BIBLE and quickly thumbs to a page) \"In the last days, critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves. Lovers of money. Self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient --\" \nMARGARET Sounds like my ex-husband. Margaret laughs. Surprised, the women laugh, too. Margaret peers at them. At their Bible. \nMARGARET Would you like to come in? \nCUT TO: \nLATER The three women sit. Margaret gazes... \nMARGARET It's been so long since I've been happy. But, I don't even know why I'm telling you... two complete strangers. \nASIAN LADY #1 It's our mission to comfort those in mourning. Jehovah wants us to help the brokenhearted. \nMARGARET So you're -- Jehovah's Witnesses? \nThe ladies nod. Margaret thinks. \nMARGARET I've explored so many religions. But they all had their flaws... \nASIAN LADY #2 Then they're wrong for you. Read your Bible -- you might be surprised by the answers it gives. \n(GENTLE) Margaret, you can't go down a path unless you know, in your heart, it's the right one. \nMARGARET And how do you know...? \nASIAN LADY #2 \n(SHE SMILES) Because our beliefs are supported by the Scriptures. Jehovah is the God of truth. Beat. Margaret glances over at a half-completed \"Keane\" on the easel. A strange pause. \nMARGARET What does that mean, exactly? \nASIAN LADY #2 \n", "test3_true": "CUT TO: \nINT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - NIGHT \nMargaret is enthralled, avidly perusing a happy-looking booklet, \"The Truth That Leads to Eternal Life.\" \nMARGARET It says here a worshiper of Jehovah must be honest in all things. Jane snorts. \nJANE I just can't believe you let people in the house. \nMARGARET I have nothing to hide! \n(TORRID) It also says no lies. \"Speak truth. Let the stealer steal no more.\" Margaret and Jane lock eyes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - DAY \nLoud JAZZ plays. Back home, Walter is living a Man's, Man's World. He's partying, drinking and dancing with two cute HIPPIE CHICKS in bikinis. The place is like a WAREHOUSE, Keane PRINTS stacked everywhere. \nHIPPIE CHICK Shit, this is crazy! All these copies... you're like Warhol! \nWALTER Nah, Warhol's like me. That fruitfly stole my act! \"The Factory\"? I had a factory before he had a soup can! The girls scrunch their faces, lost. Then -- DING-DONG! Walter peeks out the window, then grins. \nWALTER Ah! It's my art supplies. \nINT. PAINTING ROOM - SECONDS LATER \nAlone, Walter eagerly pries open a GIANT CRATE. He pulls out padding. Wadded Honolulu newspapers. Then... a PAINTING. Ah! A new WAIF, surrounded by colorful tropical plants. Walter smiles triumphantly -- until -- his happiness melts into confusion. Then horror. We ZOOM INTO the painting's SIGNATURE. It says \"MDH Keane.\" Walter freaks. \nWALTER \nAAAGGGGHH! \nCUT TO: \nINT. HAWAIIAN KINGDOM HALL - DAY \nThe JEHOVAH'S WITNESSES sing a joyous, high-spirited PSALM: \nJEHOVAH'S WITNESSES \"Tremble not before your foe, Let all lovers of truth know! That my reigning Son, Christ Jesus, From the heav'ns has cast the foe. Soon will bind the Devil, Satan, Letting all his victims go!\" Margaret and Jane are singing happily. \nINT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY \nMargaret pours her liquor down the sink. Margaret tosses her cigarettes in the trash. Margaret swells, feeling a burst of power. Then a VOICE: \nD.J. (O.S.) Oh yeah! We got a special guest today. A world-famous celebrity who just called up and asked to come in..! \nINT. RADIO BOOTH - DAY \nAngle on BIG LOLO, a gregarious Hawaiian D.J. in headphones. \nD.J. She's malihini! Moved to the islands a couple months ago... so let's give a big aloha to Margaret Keane! He pops in a cart. Canned APPLAUSE plays. We reveal across from him... Margaret. He grins. \nD.J. So is it true your husband Walter is the top-selling painter in the world? We SLOWLY PUSH IN to her. Tentative, she speaks. \nMARGARET No... Big Lolo. Everything you just said is false. Margaret takes a deep breath. Working up her courage. \nMARGARET One: Walter is no longer my husband. (a long pause) And Two: He's not... a painter. Margaret exhales. The D.J. is confused. He checks his notes. \nD.J. But, am I... mixed-up? Ain't he the guy who does the crazy eyes? \nMARGARET No. Though he's been taking credit for ten years. \n(STRONG) I'm the only painter in the family. Margaret slowly smiles. And then... a calmness comes over her. Like a cloud has lifted. \nINT. RADIO STATION HALLWAY - DAY \nMargaret and Jane walk away. Jane beams proudly, then gives her mother a warm hug.

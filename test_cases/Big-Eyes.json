{"train": "BIG EYES \nWritten by \nScott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski \nFADE IN: \nTITLE SEQUENCE: \nTIGHT on TWO PAINTED EYES. The pupils are impossibly wide. Imploring. The watery rims spill a single tear. We PULL OUT... revealing the eyes belong to a child. A young girl, fingers clasped pitifully. She's forlorn, alone in a dirty gray alley. We feel shame. Compassion. Sorrow... Then -- an IDENTICAL girl SLAPS in front of the first one. Then another! It's a PRINTING PRESS, the creation of a BLUR of sad children. \nA KINETIC montage! HORDES of gazing WAIFS get lithographed, bundled: Huddling in worry. Floating in space. POSTERS. \nPOSTCARDS. BOOKS. We ZOOM into a MAGAZINE AD: A 1960's era come-on -- \"IT'S \nKEANE! MUSEUM-QUALITY ART, MAILED DIRECTLY TO YOUR HOME!\" A blizzard of NEWSPAPER ARTICLES: \"Meet America's Million- Dollar Painter!\" \"Keane Masterpiece at World's Fair\" Painted EYES float by. Haunting... questioning... Old POLAROIDS: A family Christmas, a Keane print over the mantel. Kids play bumper pool, a Keane print in the b.g. A blurry black-and-white TV: A talk show HOST holds up a Keane \nPAINTING -- MUSIC BUILDS. FASTER. Keane brochures. Catalogs. A flyer: \"Now Open! Keane Gallery\" MORE orphan's faces. Hungry, unblinking, beseeching. A CRESCENDO -- then -- SILENCE. \nA single CARD on black: \"I think what Keane has done is just terrific. It has to be good. If it were bad, so many people wouldn't like it.\" \n-- ANDY WARHOL \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SUBURBIA - 1958 \nA nice, orderly tract of post-World War II housing. Identical rows of little yards. Young MOMS. Scampering KIDS. Then, a SUBTITLE: \"TEN YEARS EARLIER\" \nINT. HOUSE - DAY \nCU on two concerned eyes. The same eyes as the paintings. We REVEAL they belong to a real girl: JANE, 8. She sits in her small house -- a typical young family's, spare and underfurnished. \nSuddenly -- Jane's mother MARGARET ULBRICH, 28, rushes through frame. Margaret is blonde, yearning, fragile. Terribly upset, she is hurriedly packing. Margaret throws her clothes in a suitcase. She shoves Jane's clothes and toys into another. Margaret barrels through the breakfast nook, which is a mini art studio -- easel, canvases, paints. She scoops up her supplies. \nMargaret runs to the door -- then turns. The hallway is lined with her PAINTINGS. Oils and inks of wide-eyed Jane, who grows from baby to toddler to child. Hastily, Margaret takes them down, each frame leaving an empty mark on the flowered wallpaper. Finally she reaches the last spot -- a WEDDING PHOTO: Margaret and her HUSBAND, smiling, happy. Margaret peers -- then leaves it hanging. The door SLAMS. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGHWAY - DAY \nCars roar down an interstate. \nINT. PACKARD - DRIVING - DAY \nMargaret grips the wheel, uncertain. Jane stares. The car is all loaded up. REFLECTIONS of passing BILLBOARDS drift across the windshield. Images of perky, happy-fake Americans. Margaret bites her lip. Has she made the right decision...? \nCUT TO: \nEST. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY San Francisco, 1958! A mix of SKYLINES and STOCK FOOTAGE. \nEXT. FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY \nA weathered building: \"G & B FURNITURE SUPPLY.\" Margaret sits in the Packard, fixing her lipstick. Jane holds the \"WANT ADS,\" a few circled. Margaret gets out and straightens her skirt. Jane smiles. \nJANE Good luck. \nINT. FURNITURE FACTORY - DAY \nA beaten industrial office. Margaret sits anxiously, watching the BOSS, a tired guy in a cheap suit. He glowers unsurely at her JOB APPLICATION. Scratching his face. Hmmmm... \nBOSS We don't get many ladies in here. So your husband approves of you working? \nMARGARET (quiet; a soft Southern lilt) My husband and I are separated. \nBOSS \n(SHOCKED) \"Separated\"? A deadly silence. He squirms uncomfortably. She presses on. \nTOURIST GUY I'll give you one. Beat -- then she nods, agreeing. She gestures. The little BOY sits. Margaret clips a fresh sheet of paper, sharpens her charcoal... and... goes motionless. Studying the boy's face. He gazes back. Then -- inspired, she begins sketching his EYES. Large and exaggerated. Then she fills in the shape of his head. His ears. His jaw. In a rush, his likeness appears. The parents come over to peek -- then gasp. Margaret is good. She sketches faster. Focused. Until a LOUD, PLUMMY VOICE drifts in... \nMAN'S VOICE Monet? \"Monet\"?! Whew -- that's a hell of a compliment. Though, if I may respectfully disagree, I'm more in the tradition of Pissarro. Margaret looks up, distracted. She resumes her work. \nMAN'S VOICE C'mon, get closer. Closer! Look at that sunlight coming through the mottled leaves. That's a bold yellow! Curious, Margaret casually peers over... \nHER POV Holding court in another booth is WALTER KEANE, 40. Walter is astonishing: Hugely confident. Charming. Waggishly handsome. And dressed like an \"Artist\" -- striped turtleneck, with hands full of brushes. Walter's stall is filled with oils of Paris street scenes. He casually flirts with TWO YOUNG COEDS. They admire a painting. \nWALTER You wanna touch it? Do it! I lay it on thick -- you're not gonna break it! \n(UNWAVERING) I poured myself into that painting. It's thirty-five dollars. \nWalter glances over -- and notices Margaret watching him. Shy, she quickly turns away, back to her portrait. Walter smiles rakishly. He's found a new interest. \nWALTER Excuse me, Ladies. \nWIDE Walter strides up to Margaret. She peers nervously... trying to ignore him. She sketches faster. Shading... Walter watches. Admiring... and discreetly smelling her hair. Margaret pays no attention. Done, she blows into a can of Fix- It. Poosh! A fine mist sprays, setting the portrait. Without fanfare, she humbly turns the picture. \nMARGARET All finished. Her customers gape, impressed. She smiles. The guy counts out four quarters, then happily leaves. \nMARGARET AND WALTER are left together. An unspoken frisson, until -- \nWALTER You're better than spare change. You shouldn't sell yourself so cheap. \nMARGARET I'm just glad they liked it. \nWALTER Ahhh! You're past that point! Your heart is in your work... He leans in, too close. Margaret shivers. Breathing faster. \nWALTER What's your name? \nMARGARET M-Margaret... Mmm. He grins, checking her out... her loose sexy blouse and tight black capris. She flushes. \nMARGARET Wouldn't you rather flirt with those dolls over there? \nWALTER Mm, no. \n(BEAT) I like you, Margaret... He zeroes in on the artworks' signature: \"M. Ulbrich\" \nWALTER \"...Ulbrich.\" \n(IMPASSIONED) You know, Margaret Ulbrich, you're undervaluing yourself. Lemme show you how it's done. Walter spins to Jane. He SHOUTS out, like a carnival barker. \nWALTER Little Girl! How would you like your portrait sketched by the World- Renowned Margaret Ulbrich?! Queen of the Bay! In mere minutes, she will capture your soul! Hm. Jane shrugs, unimpressed. \nJANE Nah. \nWALTER \"Nah\"?! (he grabs a PAINTING) Don't you wish this were you in this beautiful painting?? \nJANE But that IS me! And that's me... (she POINTS all over) And that one started as me, but then Mother turned it into a Chinese boy. Huh? Walter peers at Jane... then at Margaret. And then -- it hits him. He grimaces, embarrassed. \nWALTER Oh, you're Mommy! My apologies, Honey. I misconstrued the situation. \n(SHEEPISH) Well I'll just mosey along, before Mr. Ulbrich comes back and socks me in the eye. \nON MARGARET A gut decision. She stares at Walter, then smiles slyly. \nMARGARET Mr. Ulbrich is out of the picture...! \nON WALTER His face slowly lights up. Ah! Sun breaking through clouds. \nCUT TO: \nEST. FRENCH BISTRO - NIGHT \nINT. BISTRO - NIGHT \nAn enchanting bistro. Wine barrels, laughing, twinkly tivoli lights. Perfection. Walter flamboyantly enters, escorting Margaret. Instantly, the STAFF ERUPTS in excitement: \"Monsieur Keane! Ah, Monsieur Keane is here! Bonsoir!\" \nWALTER Bonsoir, gang! Henri! Sorry I didn't call first. Est-ce que tout va bien? \nFRIENDLY GUY I thought that was you! \nWALTER \n(EMBARRASSED) Oh! Uh... er, hi, Don. \nFRIENDLY GUY Boy, I'm glad to see you! Have we heard back from the city, on that setback? My guys really need the variance, for the first floor retail. Walter is mortified. He turns away from Margaret. \nWALTER Um... we should hear from Permits by Thursday. \nFRIENDLY GUY Yeah? Well that's terrif'! I'll tell the architects! Pleased, the guy cheerily strides away. \nON WALTER AND MARGARET He is stricken. Something ominous just happened. \nMARGARET What was that?? \nWALTER \n(ASHAMED) I -- I didn't want you to know... A long, horrible pause. Walter's face turns gray. We SLOWLY PUSH IN. This revelation is churning. Agony. \nWALTER I'm in commercial real estate. A stunned beat. \nMARGARET You're a -- Realtor? \nWALTER \n(CONTRITE) YES! A hugely successful Realtor! Top earner in the Downtown office three years running! \nMARGARET And you're... ashamed? \nWALTER Of course! Any blockhead can arrange a sublet! \n(HEARTFELT) All I ever wanted was to support myself as an artist... \n(SAD; BEAT) I tried to make a clean break, but couldn't cut it. I'm just a goddam Sunday painter. An amateur. Margaret looks at him, touched by his vulnerability. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MARGARET'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nEnd of the day. Golden light slants in through the windows of this small tidy apartment. The door opens. Margaret holds it for Walter, who chivalrously staggers in, carrying all her supplies: Easel, paints, cans. He carefully puts it all down -- then turns. Beat. Walter stares at Margaret, their faces caught in the warm light. Then, enchanted, he kisses her. Silence. Margaret smiles, captivated. Caught in his glow. The moment could last forever... \nIN THE DOORWAY Jane stares unhappily. Threatened. \nJANE A-hem! \nON MARGARET She turns, startled. Feeling guilty, Margaret rushes from Walter. Busying herself, she skims through the MAIL. Jane shakes her head and marches out. Margaret flips through envelopes -- until one stops her. On edge, she slowly removes an official DOCUMENT. She scans it... and her face drops. Crushed. Something terrible... Walter is worried. \nWALTER What's wrong...? \nMARGARET \n(SOFT) Frank wants to take away Jane. He says I'm an unfit mother... Walter is taken aback. \nWALTER You're a perfect mother. \nMARGARET He told the court Jane doesn't have a proper home. It's beyond my abilities as a single woman... Margaret trails off, shaken. Walter gulps unsurely. Then, he takes her in his arms. We \nSLOWLY PUSH IN. \nWALTER Marry me. \nMARGARET \n(SHE GASPS) Walter! I -- \nWALTER (he puts a finger to her lips) Shh. Don't think of a reason to say no. 'Cause I've got a million reasons to say yes. (he gives a winning smile) I know it makes no sense! \n(MORE) \nRUBEN Oh definitely! Strongly influenced by the tachistes. \nFANCY LADY I heard Tab Hunter was in here, looking at one. \nRUBEN Well... I'm not allowed to say... He NODS HIS HEAD up-and-down: Yes, you're right. \nOUTSIDE A car backfires. Ruben turns -- and winces. \nThrough the windows is Walter, climbing out of his massive white Cadillac. He's all done up, in beret and scarf. He opens the giant trunk and removes a pile of paintings. Ruben cringes knowingly. He whispers: \nRUBEN Oh Christ, don't come in here. Please don't come in here... The door SLAMS. Walter loudly barges in. \nWALTER Ruben, good day! Do you got a minute? \nRUBEN Walter. In polite society, the word is \"appointment.\" \nFANCY LADY (glancing back and forth) Uh, I could come back later... She anxiously hurries for the door. Ruben fumes. Walter ignores it all and starts laying out his wares. First, the Parisian street scenes, one after another... \nWALTER You're gonna love my stuff today. \nRUBEN Haven't I seen that one before? \nWALTER Nah! That was painted in the Fifth Arrondissement. This is the Sixth Arrondissement! \nRUBEN \n(SKEPTICAL) I don't understand. You lived in Paris for a week. How can you still be cranking out paintings? Walter laughs. He points to his head. \nWALTER It's all up here. (beat; a sentimental \nFLOURISH) And here. He points to his heart. Ruben frowns and points to the wall. \nRUBEN Well, it's not going up here. \n(CRUEL) Walter, you know we don't go for that representational jazz! You're too literal. \nWALTER \n(HURT) Hey, Art isn't fashion! \nRUBEN Yes it IS! \n(CUTTING) People want Kandinsky, or Rothko! They don't want goopy street scenes. \nCLOSEUP - WALTER Ouch! This stings terribly. Walter glares at the man, then softly slides aside his works. Quietly, he pulls out Margaret's Big Eye paintings. \nWALTER Would they want... this? \nRUBEN \n(HE SHUDDERS) Good God! You've entered a new period. \nWALTER No... they're my wife's. Fascinated, Ruben glances through Margaret's oils. Canvas after canvas of sad kiddies against gray, bleak backgrounds. \nRUBEN Why are their eyes so big?! They're like big stale jellybeans. \nWALTER \n(SNIDE) It's Expressionism. Surely you recognize it. \nRUBEN \n(LONG BEAT) Well -- I'm just glad you two found each other. \nWALTER So... what do you say? Ruben looks up, amazed. Walter seems oblivious. \nRUBEN I say, NO! It's not art. \nWALTER \nTIPSY LADY Look at that child. She's so sad. \nTIPSY MAN Is she poor..? \nTIPSY LADY She's forgotten! It just makes me want to cry. (she peers at the signature, then turns) Are you \"Keane\"? Walter lifts his head from the table. \nWALTER Yeah. \nTIPSY LADY Well you're a hell of a painter. Walter squints, confused, then beams. Joy! Happiness bursting like a little child. \nWALTER Why, thank you...! Thank you so much! \nTIPSY LADY Your work is very powerful. There's so much emotion in those eyes. OUCH! Walter's smile collapses. \nTIPSY LADY Is something wrong? \nWALTER \n(REELING) Huh? Uh... no. No. I just didn't realize you meant... the waif. \nTIPSY MAN (beat; he CHUCKLES) Oh, I get it...! The artist doesn't wanna part with his favorite piece... The man winks, then pulls out a WAD OF BILLS. Walter stares morosely. \nINT. HUNGRY I - LATER \nWalter sits at the bar, toasted, drinking. In a dark place. His misery is interrupted by happy Banducci, groping two GALS. \nBANDUCCI Hello, Picasso! Nice crowd, eh? \nWALTER \n(SOUR) You wouldn't know it from that broom closet you parked me in. \nBANDUCCI Hey, it's prime thoroughfare! People drink, they gotta relieve themselves. \nWALTER \n(MUTTERING) \"Location, location, location...\" Walter wallows in self-loathing. Suddenly, he explodes. \nWALTER It's INSULTING! When people see art, they shouldn't think of SHIT! \nBANDUCCI \n(SHOCKED) Whoah! Watch it with the purple language. We got ladies present --! Banducci PUSHES Walter away. \nIn reaction, Walter sloppily SMACKS him. Riled, Banducci suddenly takes a SWING! Walter stumbles, and Banducci's punch accidently HITS the GIRL. Ow! She topples. Walter gasps. He SWATS Banducci -- then RUNS! Cameras FLASH. Wild whoops. Walter barrels down the hall, Banducci chasing. The brawl's gone nuts. Walter grabs a Waif and SMASHES it over Banducci's head. CRASH! Banducci drops. \nCUT TO: \nINSERT - SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER The front page! A small headline says \"BISTRO BRAWL: BANDUCCI AND ARTIST SLUGFEST.\" Below are two PHOTOS: Walter mid-punch, and Banducci unconscious, sticking out of the Big Eye. \nEXT. POLICE STATION - DAWN \nA neighborhood precinct, quiet at 6 a.m. Doors open, and Margaret leads Walter out. She's seething. He's bruised, with a mortified drunk-tank, slept-in-my-clothes swagger. \nMARGARET I've never posted bail before. Silence. He has no idea what to say. His aplomb crumbles. \nWALTER I'm -- I'm sorry. Banducci... laughed at our work. ...So I socked him. \nMARGARET Since when are you thin-skinned? Artists have to handle criticism. \nWALTER You're right! I know. But... I was already in a bad place. I'd had a couple... and earlier... \n(PAUSE) I let some guy think I painted your Big Eye. Beat. Margaret is stupefied. \nMARGARET I don't understand. Why would you do such a thing?! \nWALTER It was a misunderstanding. And then, I didn't want to jinx the sale. \nHe shrugs feebly. She frowns. \nINT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT \nWalter sells Big Eyes. Shoving cash into a cigar box. \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \nMargaret works, HUMMING serenely. On the easel is a half- finished blonde girl in a blue dress. \nINT. TAILOR'S - DAY \nWalter buys a new suit. A TAILOR measures him. \nINT. APARTMENT - LATE NIGHT \nMargaret finishes painting a sad boy, using a fine brush to add a watery rim to his eyes. Magically, this detail brings the picture to life. She's pleased. Margaret signs \"KEANE.\" There are two finished canvases, the sad little girl and boy. Margaret smiles, her heart swelling. She loves them. Then, she looks about. Nobody is there to share the moment. Hm. She thinks -- then picks up the PHONE. She dials. \nMARGARET Mrs. Cava, I'm sorry to bother you so late... but would you mind watching Jane? \nINT. TAXI - NIGHT \nMargaret rides in the back seat, smiling, her gaze faraway. She proudly hugs the bundled paintings to her chest. \nINT. HUNGRY I - NIGHT \nThe club is pounding. Margaret enters the throng, carrying her work. She looks up -- and has her breath taken away. The \nENTIRE CLUB, EVERY WALL, IS NOW HUNG WITH KEANE PAINTINGS! Whoa...! Pure joy envelops her. Then -- she gets jostled. Margaret notices Walter holding court with some GROUPIES. She approaches, unnoticed: \nWALTER ...yeah, eyes are powerful. A poet said they're the windows of the soul. Margaret smiles, touched. She comes closer.... \nGROUPIE They hold so much feeling. \nWALTER You got it! That's why I paint 'em so big. \n(BEAT) I've always done it that way. \nCLOSEUP - MARGARET She GASPS, stunned. The room starts spinning. \nHER POV \nWALTER If you like this style, I'm working on a few new pieces. I've got a little blonde girl in a blue dress that'll tear your heart out. \nANGLE - MARGARET Her face goes ashen. Dizzy, she clutches for support. What to do?? Overcome, she shrinks away... disappearing... ending up alone in a corner. She cowers, childlike. \nACROSS THE ROOM Walter LAUGHS at a joke, then backslaps the group. He jovially strides away... passing by Margaret... when -- \nMARGARET Walter...? He spins -- shocked at her presence. \nWALTER Baby! \n(DISCOMBOBULATED) Hey, uh, what are you doing here? I \nUM -- \nMARGARET Why are you lying? For once, Walter has no answer. She bores in, emotions racing. Confused. Hurt. \nMARGARET You're taking credit for something that isn't yours. He looks ill. Wheels spinning, looking for an out -- \nWALTER I was... trying to close the deal -- \nMARGARET Those children are part of my being! \nWALTER I'm just a salesman! You know, buyers pay more if they meet the painter -- \nMARGARET They couldn't meet me, because you told me to stay home!! \nWALTER Shh, QUIET! He grabs her, pulling her behind a curtain. He's desperate. \nWALTER Don't blow this! Look, we're makin' money! Your pocket, my pocket? What's the difference?! \nEXT. PUBLIC BUILDING - DAY \nWalter thrusts a painted Ballerina at a SOVIET DIPLOMAT. \nWALTER In the interest of peace through culture, we donate this painting to the people of Russia! \nINT. PHONEBOOTH - NIGHT \nDick whispers into a phone. \nDICK The Purple Onion. 9:30. Joan Crawford has a dinner reservation. \nINT. PURPLE ONION - NIGHT \nJOAN CRAWFORD is eating with friends. Suddenly Walter lunges into view, startling her. He lugs a painting. \nWALTER Miss Crawford! In recognition of your cinematic craft, we bestow this painting, \"The Lion and the Child\"! \nINT. APARTMENT - DAY \nMargaret paints. Walter beams. \nWALTER Joan said \"Marvelous\"! MARVELOUS! That's worth more than 1000 critics! (he CLAPS his hands) Hey, maybe she'll come to our opening. \nMARGARET But... isn't it strange? Artists get shown. They don't build their own galleries. \nWALTER Says who?! Like John Q. Public cares? He's FED UP with abstract neoformalism! She responds -- but he sexily puts his finger to her mouth. \nWALTER He digs real art. Your art! It's beautiful. You're beautiful... Walter starts rubbing against her, dancing sensually. She laughs, embarrassed, her wet paint brushes smearing his chest. She relents and relaxes. They dance around... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. CITY STREETS - EARLY MORNING \nIn the shadows, POSTERS of \"The Waif\" get glued up. Under her woeful face, it says \"KEANE GALLERY 494 Broadway.\" We WIDEN, as Walter, Margaret and Jane hastily slap up the posters. They carry glue buckets and a ladder. \nWALTER Ruben's gonna choke when he sees this! Little Jane tiredly glues another poster. She yawns. \nJANE I remember when Momma painted that. Huh? Suddenly, Margaret freezes. She hadn't anticipated this. Margaret looks to Walter. He stares back, waiting. \nMARGARET Are you -- sure? That was a long time ago. \nJANE Sure I'm sure! It was in our old apartment, and you had me sit on a stool in the kitchen -- \nWALTER \n(CUTTING IN) No, dear, I'm afraid you're confused. I painted that one -- \nJANE No, Mother did! Look! I'm wearing my blue dress. \nMARGARET L-lots of girls have that dress... Margaret trails off, sickened. Not knowing how to lie. Walter takes charge. He kneels, then smiles gently at Jane. \nWALTER You have a good eye, sweetie. I painted it, but I was trying to mimic your mother's style. You know, the style she USED to paint in. \nCLOSEUP - JANE A loooooong pause. She examines the print. Then... she nods. \nJANE Well you did a really good job. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO NORTH BEACH - DAY \nCU on the Waif. We widen, revealing the ENTIRE WORLD has been hijacked, blanketed by THE POSTERS. People gape -- astonished and captivated. Disconnected from it all, strolling alone, is Margaret. She is burdened by her own thoughts. Regretful... Across the street, she sees a GOTHIC CHURCH. She stares up, awed by the beauty. It's Catholic imagery in all its glory: Saints... Jesus... Mary... Suddenly -- the bells RING. Hm. Margaret takes a step... \nINT. CHURCH CONFESSION BOOTH - DAY \nMargaret tentatively enters and kneels. Beat -- then the grille OPENS. She reacts, discomposed. \nMARGARET Hello. I've -- never really done this before. I'm not sure how you... \nWALTER Yeah, we don't talk about it. Sadly, people don't buy lady art. \nMARGARET \n(INTERJECTING) What about Georgia O'Keefe? Dick shakes his EMPTY GLASS, distracted. Walter points. \nWALTER The bar's over there. Dick goes to get a refill. Walter shoots Margaret a look. \nWALTER Yeah, Margaret's a superb artist, in her own way. I even steal a few tips from her, now and then! \n(HE CHUCKLES) Behind every great man is a great woman. \nDICK True true. So Margaret, where do you get your ideas? \nMARGARET (a bit tentative) Oh... from the world around me. And I love Modigliani's use of line. \nDICK ModiWHAT? The Italian joint? \nWALTER Oh, for Christ's sake, Margaret! Dick writes a gossip column -- \n(BEAT) Let's stick to the family angle. Get a gander at little Janie over there! Walter steers Dick to Jane, cute at her little child's easel. \nWALTER What a talent! Look at these Keanes! If you cut open our veins, we bleed oil! Er -- turpentine. \n(AWKWARD) Uh, Dick, you know what I'm goin' for. Make it sound good. DING-DONG! It's the doorbell. Everyone turns. \nJANE Who's that? \nWALTER Ah! A little treat! The fourth member of the Painting Keanes! Margaret and Jane turn, confused. Walter whips open \nTHE FRONT DOOR Revealing LILY, 10, a quiet girl in bobbed hair. She holds a little overnight bag. A Buick HONKS, and Walter waves as it drives away. Walter stares at the girl, then puts on big hammy airs. \nWALTER Lily, honey, how are you?! He gives her a giant hug. She responds stiffly -- a girl who doesn't see her father too often. \nLILY I'm fine, Dad. I lost a tooth. \nWALTER Really? Did you get in a fight? \nLILY \n(SHE LAUGHS) No. It fell out! \nANGLE - MARGARET AND JANE They gape in bewilderment. Who the hell is this girl??! \nBACK ON WALTER AND LILY Walter admires Lily's mouth. \nWALTER Well is the tooth fairy somethin' I gotta deal with, or did your mother already handle it? \nLILY \n(DRY) She handled it. \nWALTER Good! Good good! Well, just go throw your stuff in the kids' room, then you can come join the fun! Lily toddles out. \nON THE GROUP Margaret and Jane are speechless. Walter acts like nothing bizarre has happened. Dick eyeballs all this with major curiosity. \nDICK Walter... you never told me you had another daughter. \nWALTER Didn't I? Sure. Lil's from my first marriage. Margaret struggles to hold her rage. Disoriented... \nMARGARET Walter? \n(URGENT) Walter! We need to speak. Margaret gestures: Get in the kitchen! He nods and follows. \nINT. KITCHEN \nMargaret shuts the door, then spins on him. \nMARGARET What is going on here??! \n(PLEASED) So what's your mom like? \nLILY She's pretty. She drives a Buick. She cries a lot. \nJANE Yeah, mine's the same. \n(BEAT) Except she drives a Packard. Lily nods. Jane lowers her voice naughtily. \nJANE I have some peanut butter hidden in my sock drawer. Do you wanna eat it? Lily smiles: Sure. Jane opens a drawer and removes a jar of Skippy. The two girls sit on the floor, happily eating the peanut butter with their fingers. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT \nKlieg lights streak the sky! A crazed CROWD is packed INSIDE. A big sign announces: \"NOW APPEARING: AMERICA'S FIRST FAMILY OF ART - 'We paint truth and emotion.'\" \nINT. KEANE GALLERY - NIGHT \nThe place is filled with Big Eyes. Waifs waifs waifs! Cash registers RING. Money changes hands. \"Sold\" stickers go up. Walter works the room. \nWALTER Yeah, Walter Keane and Gauguin have a lot in common. They both walked away from successful careers to travel the globe, live on a boat... We move... finding Margaret alone in a small ANNEX. It displays a few of her sad blondes, alongside Jane and Lily's paintings of flowers and Mr. Potato-Head. Margaret sits, seeming like an adult at the children's table. An urbane RICH MAN glides by... and is taken with one of Margaret's nubile blondes. He gazes at the lounging figure. Margaret sits up. Alert, pleased with his interest. She tingles. Then, happily excited, unable to hold it in: \nMARGARET I painted it! \nRICH MAN Really? \n(IMPRESSED) It's very evocative. ...Sensual... He smiles flirtatiously. She smiles shyly and shrugs. \nHe steps forward -- then peers closer at the painting. The SIGNATURE is a feminine scroll: \"MDH Keane\" \nRICH MAN \"MDH\"? You're so... mysterioso. \nMARGARET Yes, we don't use my name, since people don't take women's art seriously. \n(BEAT) \"MDH\" are my initials. And more! I'm interested in numerology... and as you know, seven is a very good number. \nRICH MAN \n(PUZZLED) Er... seven? \nMARGARET Luckily, my maiden name is Margaret Doris Hawkins! \"M\" is the 13th letter of the alphabet, \"D\" is 4, \"H\" 8! If you add up 1 and 3 in 13, that gives you 4, making 4 plus 4 plus 8 equals 16, then 1 plus 6 equals seven! The man's head is spinning. He's lost all interest. Across the room, Walter sees this debacle. He marches over. \nWALTER Psst! Maggie! Can I have a second? (he PULLS HER ASIDE) Good grief! What the hell are you babbling about?! Long division?? Could you please help the world and shut your mouth? You want just one number in his head: The sales price! Her face drops, hurt. Acquiescing. \nWATCHING THIS Two SNOBBY ARTISTS smirk and GROAN at this scene. \nSNOBBY ARTIST #1 Two nuts that fell from the same tree! It's insufferable. Why are we starving, while they print money? \nSNOBBY ARTIST #2 Because that nut's a genius! He sells paintings! Then he sells pictures of the paintings! Then he sells postcards of pictures of the paintings. \nThey stare bitterly. Then, a terrible, shameful idea forms: \nSNOBBY ARTIST #1 I'll bet I could bang one out in ten minutes. \nSNOBBY ARTIST #2 It wouldn't have the dopey sincerity. \nSNOBBY ARTIST #1 The customers won't notice... They peer sheepishly at each other... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STORE WINDOW - DAY \nRuben is walking past -- then stops, pained. A window display of Keane Big Eyes shares space with paintings of CUTESY KITTENS lapping up milk. We WIDEN, revealing a whole wall of rip-offs! All with odd anonymous signatures: \"Gig.\" \"Eve.\" \"Igor.\" A cavalcade of \nWIDE-EYED ANIMALS AND KIDS... DANCING WITH GUITARS... DRESSED AS HOBOS... PLAYING IN PAJAMAS. But these children aren't sad. They're just... blank. Ruben gasps at the dead-eyed pictures. \nRUBEN Christ. It's a movement. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PAINTING ROOM \nA room full of MDHs and Keanes. Dee-Ann stops, puzzled. She glances at Margaret -- who has turned white as a ghost. Immensely curious, Dee-Ann slowly enters. She peers around at the two styles of paintings... A strained silence. Finally, Margaret whispers. \nMARGARET W-Walter paints in here too. Hmm. Dee-Ann walks about, examining the canvases. Then, her gaze settles on the Big Eye that Margaret was working on. Below the easel is the wet brush on the open jar of paint. Margaret sucks in her breath. Dee-Ann sees this. \nDEE-ANN Is Walter home?? Margaret has no answer. The two friends look at each other... Dee-Ann waiting... wondering if Margaret is going to lie to her... \nWhen..... SLAM! \nWIDE Both women startle. FOOTSTEPS. Then... Walter strides in! Margaret's eyes pop. Walter's pop even bigger. He glares at the ladies. \nWALTER What the hell's going on here?!! \nMARGARET \n(TIMID) Uh... Dee-Ann was just... she... Margaret trails off. Walter thinks, then SNAPS. \nWALTER You KNOW I don't like anyone seeing my work before it's done! Walter rushes to the Waif, then for show grabs up the wet brush and quickly starts to \"finish\" the painting. Suddenly -- an odd expression crosses his face. He eyeballs the canvas, realizing he doesn't know what to do. A furtive glance. Then, unbowed, he hastily dips the brush and slaps a little black onto the shaded background. Walter spins, victorious. \nWALTER There! \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATER \nThe three sit silently, tension thick, sipping gin fizzes. Nobody speaks. Walter finishes his drink and pours a fresh one. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FOYER - NIGHT \nThey are drunk and SCREAMING. Walter pushes Dee-Ann out the door. \nWALTER You and your whole non-representational crowd are FRAUDS!! \nDEE-ANN SHUT UP! You're so full of shit, Walter! \nWALTER Get outta my house! My big house! \n(LIVID) Go back to sellin' your coat hanger sculptures on Fisherman's Wharf! \nDEE-ANN Fuck you! Dee-Ann staggers outside, then hops in her car. \nOUTSIDE Dee-Ann GUNS the engine and squeals away. The car peels down the very long driveway. Margaret and Walter watch the car disappear into the distance. Without looking over, Walter speaks. \nWALTER I don't want her ever invited here again. Margaret nods, terribly sad. \nMARGARET I won't. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATE NIGHT \nMargaret and Walter lie in bed, awake. Arms crossed. Unspeaking. \nEXT. WOODSIDE HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY \nMargaret and 13-YEAR-OLD JANE play on the lawn with the poodle. Jane laughs as the dog chases in circles. \nJANE Go, Rembrandt! Get the ball! She tumbles, and Rembrandt licks her ear. She giggles. \nMARGARET Okay, honey. I have to go work. \nJANE Can I come? (an awkward silence) No. I can never come. No! I shouldn't even ask. Jane glares glumly. Margaret peers hopelessly at her daughter... then goes inside. \nINT. WOODSIDE HOUSE \nMargaret strolls to her studio. WE SEE the poodle scampering behind her on its cute little legs. She enters the \nWALTER \"Cenic\"...? Uh, what's that? Margaret stares, eyes sharp. \nMARGARET Cenic is the name of the artist who did all your early paintings. \nWALTER Huhhh? (spinning his lie) Urgh... oh! CENIC! (he laughs crazily) Cenic was my nickname in Paris! All my art school pals loved my scenic views, so they called me \"Scenic\"! But since those Frogs can't pronounce a hard \"e,\" I became \"Cenic.\" He looks up at her hopefully. But she shakes her head. \nMARGARET The more you lie, the smaller you seem. \nWALTER (unyielding, scrambling) How DARE you accuse me of lying! I'm proud of my early Cenics! \nMARGARET Then why do you paint over the name? Walter gasps, floored. Margaret bores in. \nMARGARET A bit of advice: Don't use a water- base over an oil. It flecks off. Walter cowers. \nWALTER You sound crazy! For God's sake. You've... you've SEEN me paint!!!! \nMARGARET No, I haven't. \n(QUIET; STRONG) I always thought I had... but it's some kind of... mirage. From a distance you look like a painter, but up close... there's nothing there. \nCLOSEUP - WALTER All life drains from his face. His eyes go glazed. He speaks mechanically. Tiredly... \nWALTER I studied art in Paris. I went to school at the Beaux-Arts. The Grand Chaumiere. I spent hours in the Louvre, gazing at the greatness of the Masters... \nMARGARET Walter? He turns. She winces, pained. \nMARGARET Have you even been to Paris? Walter blanches. He shakes, broken up. He looks away, then staggers to a chair. He falls into it. Trembling. Not able to look her in the eye... \nWALTER I wanted... I so wanted to be an artist. But -- it just never turned out good. Margaret stares, seething. Then, without comment, she storms away. She SLAMS the door shut. BANG! Walter doesn't move. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - NEXT MORNING \nMargaret makes Jane breakfast, scrambling up eggs. Jane glances over her shoulder -- and notices Walter in the living room, asleep on the couch. An awkward pause. Jane says nothing. \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - LATER \nMargaret is making the bed. Straightening the pillows. In the b.g., Walter silently creeps into view. Shamefully standing in the doorway. Not speaking... Margaret knows he's there, but doesn't acknowledge his presence. Finally, without making eye contact -- \nMARGARET I don't want you sleeping in this room any longer. I -- I can't keep living these lies. \n(SHARP) There's three extra bedrooms. Go pick one. He nods. \nINT. HOUSE - LATER \nMargaret sits, unmoving, trapped in the big house. Outside, a JAPANESE GARDENER trims the hedges. Margaret stares at the walls, a smothering Walter Hall of Fame: Framed magazine articles on Walter, smugly posed with the Waifs. She swallows, then gently opens a dresser drawer. Inside is an ORIGINAL WAIF from long ago. A small oil of Jane, when she was a toddler. Margaret stares... and then her face slowly crumbles. \nINT. PAINTING ROOM - DAY \nMargaret huddles with a SKETCHPAD. Rembrandt is at her feet. She's drawing. She looks up, as Walter anxiously enters. He's holding a drink. He clears his throat. \nWALTER What are you working on? \nMARGARET A new MDH. Something for me. It's about a woman trapped in an uncaring world. I call it, \"Escape.\" Walter bites his lip, afraid to talk. \nWALTER I figured out a solution to our problems. \nMARGARET What? \nWALTER Teach me. \n(BEAT) Show me your tricks. Then you can pass off the Waifs, and we won't be lying anymore. She looks up in disbelief. \nMARGARET And then -- YOU'LL paint them? \nWALTER Sure! Why not? \nMARGARET \nREDHEAD CLERK Uh, let me -- \nWALTER What about the OILS?! Are there more at the warehouse? \nREDHEAD CLERK Mr. Keane, I'd have to make a -- \nWALTER For the LOVE OF MUD! What am I PAYING you for? The girl freezes, rattled. Walter spins, flipping out. \nWALTER Hypothetical question: If you were a man, would you marry Kim Novak or my wife? What? \nWALTER Okay! Different question! If I got crippled and had to stop painting, how long before the gallery ran out of inventory and went belly up?? \nREDHEAD CLERK \n(RATTLED) Do you want a glass of water, Mr. Keane? Walter sighs. His thoughts drift away... \nWALTER What's it all mean? Why are we put on this earth? A 100 years from now, will people even know we existed...? \nREDHEAD CLERK \n(UNCOMFORTABLE) I -- I don't understand. You'll always be famous. You were on the Jack Paar Show... (she glances away) Er, excuse me, sir. The girl hurries away, to ring up some customers. Walter silently watches. At the register, the Tourists buy a print. A \"Madonna and Child,\" MDH-style. BAMMM! Walter's eyes bulge, like he's been stung. \nWALTER It's not even mine! It's one of hers. Aching, he staggers off. Sweating, woozy, he sits at a table. Distracted, he glances down at a newspaper... \nINSERT - NEWSPAPER There's an article on the 1964 NEW YORK WORLD'S FAIR. A headline says \"CONSTRUCTION RACES TOWARD APRIL OPENING\" \nTIGHT - WALTER His eyes narrow, piqued. World's Fair??? He leans in... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BISTRO - NIGHT \nA return to the charming bistro Margaret and Walter went to all those years ago, on their first date. The Maitre'd BEAMS. \nMAITRE'D Ah! Monsieur and Madame Keane! Delighted! Always such an honor! ANGLE on the Keanes. They are sullen. At wit's end. \nAT THE TABLE - LATER They stiffly sit at their old table. He snarls, eyes black. \nWALTER This doesn't change anything. \nMARGARET (trying to hold her ground) I know the truth. \nWALTER Who cares?! This is all your fault! Maybe it's time to shake things up. Start puttin' my name on the MDH's. Margaret is astonished. A fury crosses her face. \nMARGARET NO! Absolutely NOT!! I still hate myself for giving you the Waifs! \nWALTER Quiet! Lower your voice -- \nMARGARET Oh, I'll talk as LOUD AS I WANT -- \nWALTER NO YOU WON'T! Or -- \n(FLAILING) I'll have you whacked! She jerks, flabbergasted. \nMARGARET What??! \nWALTER If you tell ANYONE, if you squeal, I'll take you out! I -- I know people. Remember Banducci's cousin? The liquor wholesaler? Pause. Margaret breaks into tears. \nMARGARET You're threatening me...?! Fine, kill me! My God, I've kept our secret for years! I've never once -- \n(CRYING) Do you know what it's been like for me? I don't have any friends. I've lied to my own child... Margaret shudders, distraught. Mascara runs down her cheeks. Walter squirms, uneasy with this. \nWALTER Christ, wipe your face! You look a mess. \n(BEAT) It's life imitating art! A crying Keane! He hands her his handkerchief. She dabs at her eyes. A looming quiet. \nMARGARET What do you want, Walter? Everything with you is calculated. We're back where we had our first date... Walter's eyes widen. We MOVE IN TIGHT on them. He drops his voice. Dead serious. \nWALTER Look, I don't deny I need you. You're the one with the gift. \nINSERT - LIFE MAGAZINE A gargantuan spread. The LIFE ARTICLE is titled \"The Man Who Paints Those Big Eyes.\" We PULL OUT... \nINT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY \nStarchy John Canaday reads the article, gaping in utter disbelief. His desk says \"JOHN CANADAY, SENIOR ART CRITIC.\" He also has Walter's BOOK, \"Tomorrow's Masters Series.\" We WIDEN, revealing he's in the busy New York Times NEWSROOM. \nCANADAY Four... five... SIX pages! Is there something here I'm missing? \n(UPSET) He's like -- the Hula-Hoop! He just won't go away...! He flips a page -- then his jaw drops. \nCANADAY \"Will be unveiled in the Grand Pavilion of the Hall of Education... internationally celebrated artist has been selected... will represent the aspirations of children worldwide --\" \n(HE GASPS) Oh this is ABSURD! He GRABS for his phone. \nINT. WORLD'S FAIR HALL OF EDUCATION - DAY \nA panel flicks, and the huge empty space lights up. It's overwhelmingly cavernous, a bright, freshly-painted Space Age spectacular. Up high hangs The Masterpiece and its 100 kids. A sign says \"TOMORROW FOREVER.\" Below, two tiny figures walk in: Canaday and an obtuse CIVIC LEADER. Canaday stares up in horror. Utterly stupefied. \nCANADAY And WHO was on the selection committee? \nCIVIC LEADER Oh! Well there wasn't a \"committee,\" per se. We just had a luncheon with me, Ed, Jerome, Jerome's wife... \n(MORE) \nCIVIC LEADER (CONT'D) \n(HE THINKS) Though technically, we didn't invite submissions. Mr. Keane just contacted us directly! Canaday reacts, smoldering. \nINT. NEW YORK MANSION - DAY \nA STRING QUARTET PLAYS at a GRAND PARTY. It's completely fabulous -- an old-money mansion filled with stuffy BLUE BLOODS, all tuxes and gowns. In the doorway appear Walter and Margaret. They're dressed to kill. Walter's radiant -- but Margaret looks like she's about to emotionally disintegrate. Suddenly, he WHISPERS. \nWALTER Stop. Let us appreciate this moment. This is what we've worked toward our whole lives: Rarified air. Inside this house are the movers and shakers. Kennedys. Rockefellers. \n(MISTY-EYED) Until today, we've always been on the outside, looking in. But when we enter... we will belong. \nMARGARET I was happier selling paintings in the park. He gapes, appalled. \nWALTER You are one crazy bitch. Walter spins and grandly enters. He grabs two CHAMPAGNES from a server. \nWALTER So maybe you have problems with the choices we made... but -- c'mon! Wednesday, the World's Fair opens. Thursday, our book goes on sale! \nMARGARET Friday, I file for divorce. \nWALTER Aw, why are you always so miserable? \n(IRRITATED) Well, I'm gonna enjoy my afternoon! The HOSTESS is a bejeweled dowager. Walter makes a beeline. \nWALTER Mrs. Teasdale! Walter Keane. I just want to thank you for hosting this absolutely enchanting soiree. Walter takes the woman's hand. She smiles stiffly, silently horrified. She glances around for help. She catches a SOCIETY MAN's eye, and he hurries over. \nSOCIETY MAN Hey, Keane. Have you seen the Times? \nWALTER Er, no. Honestly, I've been so busy all day preparing for this lovely -- \nSOCIETY MAN I think you should read the Times. The Man gestures. Perplexed, the Keanes follow him into a \nINT. DEN - SAME TIME \nThe room looks like a hunting lodge. On the desk are all the DAILY PAPERS. Walter grabs the NEW YORK TIMES -- then gasps. \nINSERT - NEW YORK TIMES It's open to a reproduction of \"Tomorrow Forever,\" above a scathing REVIEW. \nTHE KEANES stare, then turn pale. \nINSERT - REVIEW A BLIZZARD of WORDS assaults us: \n\"GROTESQUE\" \"APPALLING\" \n\"TASTELESS\" \"Lowest common denominator\" \n(CUTTING) Maybe you need to make some. \nMARGARET Y-you know I can't have people over to the house. \nJANE That's right! Or they'd see the precious paintings!! \nMargaret has no response. Jane runs off. \nINT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY \nMargaret is alone, pouring a drink. She mixes in some ice -- then sees something odd. \nOUTSIDE THE WINDOW Coming down the long driveway are two FIGURES. Two small WOMEN, patiently walking toward the isolated house. Margaret stares, puzzled. The women come closer. They are Asian, dressed in formal dresses. Curious, Margaret creeps over, spying on them... They walk up and ring the bell. DING-DONG! An unsure beat... then Margaret opens the door. The ladies smile politely. \nASIAN LADY #1 Hello. We're visiting everyone in this neighborhood with an important message. No doubt you're busy, so we'll be brief. Huh? Margaret stares at them deadpan, highball in her hand. \nASIAN LADY #2 We have something to share with you about the wonderful things that God's Kingdom will do for mankind. Margaret's face darkens. \nMARGARET I'm not interested. She starts to close the door... but they continue. \nASIAN LADY #1 Do you mean that you are not interested in the Bible, or in religion in general? \nMARGARET I'm not interested in whatever you're selling. The lady glances at Margaret's glass. She smiles gently. \nASIAN LADY #2 But we're not selling anything. We're just here to share the good news. \nMARGARET \n(DOUR) From where I'm standing, I don't see much good anywhere. Just a lot of pride, and thievery, and people treating each other poorly. \nASIAN LADY #2 Yes! Exactly! That is the good news! What? Margaret is lost. The ladies grab the opening. \nASIAN LADY #1 Bad things in the world are a sign. They show us that earthly Paradise is at hand. \nASIAN LADY #2 Do you know what it says in Timothy \n(she pulls out a BIBLE and quickly thumbs to a page) \"In the last days, critical times hard to deal with will be here. For men will be lovers of themselves. Lovers of money. Self-assuming, haughty, blasphemers, disobedient --\" \nMARGARET Sounds like my ex-husband. Margaret laughs. Surprised, the women laugh, too. Margaret peers at them. At their Bible. \nMARGARET Would you like to come in? \nCUT TO: \nLATER The three women sit. Margaret gazes... \nMARGARET It's been so long since I've been happy. But, I don't even know why I'm telling you... two complete strangers. \nASIAN LADY #1 It's our mission to comfort those in mourning. Jehovah wants us to help the brokenhearted. \nMARGARET So you're -- Jehovah's Witnesses? \nThe ladies nod. Margaret thinks. \nMARGARET I've explored so many religions. But they all had their flaws... \nASIAN LADY #2 Then they're wrong for you. Read your Bible -- you might be surprised by the answers it gives. \n(GENTLE) Margaret, you can't go down a path unless you know, in your heart, it's the right one. \nMARGARET And how do you know...? \nASIAN LADY #2 \n(SHE SMILES) Because our beliefs are supported by the Scriptures. Jehovah is the God of truth. Beat. Margaret glances over at a half-completed \"Keane\" on the easel. A strange pause. \nMARGARET What does that mean, exactly? \nASIAN LADY #2 \nCUT TO: \nINT. NEW YORK TIMES - DAY \nJohn Canaday stands over a WIRE SERVICE TELETYPE MACHINE. He stares at a printout, incredulous. \nCANADAY You have got to be kidding! \nINT. CHINESE RESTAURANT - DAY \nTIGHT - The San Francisco Examiner. A small headline says \n\"EYE DID IT! CLAIMS WIFE\" We PULL OUT, revealing Dee-Ann. She grins in disbelief. \nDEE-ANN I knew it!!! \nINT. SAN FRANCISCO EXAMINER - DICK'S CUBICLE - DAY \nDick Nolan reads the article -- and SPITS UP his martini. \nINT. HUNGRY I - DAY \nBanducci CACKLES, terribly amused. \nINT. ART GALLERY - DAY \nRuben SHRIEKS at the article. \nRUBEN Who would WANT credit?! \nINT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY \nWalter sits in his favorite haunt, eating lunch and reading a NEWSPAPER. Suddenly -- he GASPS. \nWALTER Holy mother of GOD! Walter JERKS UP -- feral -- like an animal sensing danger. He whirls and looks around. Paranoia ratcheting. Is everybody staring at him? Walter starts shaking in horror. Then -- he jumps and BOLTS OUT. \nINT. BAR - NIGHT \nWalter sits with Dick. Walter's desperate, sweaty. \nWALTER Margaret's gone berserk! You gotta help me! I need a story, a wire story -- national! -- to calm things down. Dick peers shrewdly. \nDICK I don't know... Walter. What she has said is pretty inflammatory. \nWALTER But it's nuts! It doesn't even make sense. When I was studying art at the Beaux Arts in Paris, she was still a kid in Tennessee! Dick reacts. Walter whips out the \"Tomorrow's Master's\" BOOK. \nWALTER Look! These are my early sketches. (he flips pages, like a \nMAGICIAN) See?! Berlin orphans, 1946! \nDICK \n(PIQUED) But... how could she... \nWALTER Exactly! It's impossible! We didn't meet for another nine years! After she busted her first marriage. \n(HE SHRUGS) Hell, she busted OUR marriage! Sleeping around with whatever trash she could find!! Dick's head is spinning. \nDICK I-I, but... why would Maggie do this? \nWALTER She's unhinged! She left me and moved into the jungle. She fell in with a bunch of religious zealots: \n(WHISPERING) Jehovah's Witnesses. \nDICK I really don't know much about them... \nWALTER Oh! These people are gone! Solid gone! They don't celebrate Christmas, they can't salute the flag... they won't even let Janie go to the prom! Dick is startled. \nINT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY \nGANNETT LAWYER We were charged with libel. You're charged with slander. \n(BLASE) Just dance your way out of it. The Lawyers file out, leaving Walter alone at the table. He looks very small and pale. The Judge peers quizzically. \nJUDGE Mr. Keane, you appear to be without counsel. Would you like a postponement, in order to get your affairs in order? Walter glances over at Margaret. She stifles a laugh. He glares daggers. Then, cocksure, foolhardy, he jumps to his feet. \nWALTER I've always taken care of myself, Your Honor. And I don't need a bunch of rent-a-suits to defend my good name! \n(BEAT) Let's PROCEED! \nCUT TO: \nINSERT - WIRE SERVICE TELETYPE MACHINE Words type out: \"AP - HONOLULU - KEANE TRIAL TAKES STARTLING \nTURN\" \nINSERT - ANOTHER WIRE SERVICE MACHINE More words type out: \"UPI - HONOLULU - HE'S A PAINTER... AND A \nLAWYER?\" \nINT. DICK NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY \nDick frantically types at his typewriter. \nDICK (V.O.) I'm concerned about my old pal Walter Keane. The Hawaiian heat may have cooked his brain! The only thing he knows about courtrooms and lawyers comes from watching Perry Mason on television! \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nWalter stands down front. Like a Broadway star, center-stage. \nWALTER I'm the sole creator of my art. This is my total life. My contribution to the world -- \nJUDGE Mr. KEANE! I've told you, you must ask the witness questions! If you're acting as your own attorney, you cannot make statements at this time. \nWALTER Oh. Right! Ah, sorry, Your Honor. \n(BEAT) It's hard to keep this all straight... Walter gathers his thoughts -- then turns to the WITNESS STAND. Sitting in it... is Margaret. \nWALTER Mrs. Keane. It seems impossible that you'd expect anybody to swallow your fantastic story -- \nJUDGE \nMR. KEANE!! Walter grimaces. He tries again, choosing his words. \nWALTER Mrs. Keane. You seem like a lucid woman. Reasonably intelligent... So how could you possibly have gone along with such a far-out scheme? \nWe slowly MOVE IN ON MARGARET. This is her moment. And then -- quietly, she speaks. \nMARGARET I was forced into it. You had -- She stops, bothered by this awkwardness. She looks away from Walter, to the Jury instead. \nMARGARET He had me dominated. He would rant and rave if I didn't do what he wanted. I was afraid. I didn't see any option, so I went along. I felt very bad... \nWALTER (like a TV lawyer) I want to remind you you are under oath. The Judge SLAMS his fists down, enraged. Walter jumps. \nWALTER S-sorry. Margaret turns back to the Jury. \nMARGARET I just gave in. I allowed him to take credit for the big eyes. They reflected all my feelings... and... it was like losing a child... \n(SHE SIGHS) I was weak. I didn't feel I could leave and support myself and my daughter. He said nobody would buy the paintings without his personality. \n(SOFT) Maybe he was right... \n(TO WALTER) You were very talented at being charming. You were a genius at salesmanship and promotion. \nWALTER Hm! It sounds like you've described two different men. One a sadistic ogre... and the other a delightful bon vivant. Margaret stares him in the eyes. \nMARGARET That's you, Walter. Jekyll and Hyde. \nLATER \nWALTER Miss Natalie Wood walked up and said, \"That is the greatest single painting I have ever seen in my entire life.\" The Judge is bored out of his mind. \nLATER \nWALTER I was born in a small town. My father made upholstery for the automobile \nINDUSTRY -- \nJUDGE You're done. Walter stops, surprised. \nWALTER B-but, I'm not finished -- \nJUDGE Actually, you are! (he blows his stack) I cannot stomach one more wild tangent or shaggy dog tale. You're not testifying -- you're filibustering! The Federal Courts are overburdened enough, without your docket-clogging nonsense. \n(BEAT) We can stay here until we grow old and die... but it's obvious that this case boils down to your word versus Mrs. Keane's word. \nWALTER \n(HOPEFUL) So... mistrial? \nJUDGE NO! It's not a mistrial!! In my opinion, there's only one way to clear up this thicket. You are both going to paint. Walter gasps, stunned. All color drains from his face. \nANGLE - MARGARET Her face lights up. She slowly breaks into a satisfied smile. \nCUT TO: \nINT. COURTROOM - LATER \nThe doors SLAM open. The Bailiff leads in a crew of COURT DEPUTIES, all carrying ART SUPPLIES: Easels, brushes, paint... \nBAILIFF Awright, bring those easels down. Careful, don't bump anything... watch it with those paint cans, I got some newspaper on the floor down front... The Jury is fascinated. Margaret watches, quite eager. In the gallery, Jane grins. But Walter is horrified. Trying not to tremble. \nDOWN FRONT The Bailiff directs the deputies, setting up TWO EASELS, back to back. On each easel is placed a small square canvas. The Judge addresses the room. \nJUDGE Now, I'm not looking for a masterpiece. I don't know much about these things -- I'm a jurist, not an art critic -- but, is one hour enough? Margaret nods: Sure. Shaking, Walter barely moves his head. \nJUDGE Okay then. You've both been provided with identical supplies... so -- without any further business... Mrs. Keane, Mr. Keane, the court is yours. \nWIDE Margaret glances at Walter. What will he do? Walter's face is grimly blank. Margaret proceeds. Slowly, she pushes her chair from the table and rises. Walter doesn't move. Margaret walks over to the closest EASEL, then sits. She ties on a smock over her checkered dress. \nTHE JURORS crane their necks, intently curious. \nMARGARET takes a pencil. She peeks over at Walter -- who's still glued to his seat. His face tight, his expression queasy. Staring off to some faraway place. Margaret looks up at the CLOCK. 3:20. Okay then. Totally calm, in a motion she's done so many times, she focuses on the canvas and starts outlining a Waif. Everybody watches. Effortlessly, she pencils the EYES. They are enormous. The largest orbs she has ever done. \nWALTER looks ill. Wracked with uncertainty. The Judge turns to him. \nJUDGE Mr. Keane? \nWALTER \n(FAINT) I'm... setting the mood. \n(WHISPERING) Getting the... muse to strike... \nJUDGE \n(BEAT) Well, your muse has 58 minutes. \nMARGARET fills in more detail. Ears... nose... then, little fingers clutching a fence. The child is peeking over it, staring right at us... \nWALTER is melting down. In total crisis... \nTHE CLOCK'S second hand sweeps around. It's 3:34... \nTHE JURORS look from Margaret to Walter. Why isn't he moving?? \nMARGARET finishes penciling. She leans back, satisfied with the composition. Then, she reaches for... the PAINT. She unscrews a tube and squirts it on the palette. She rests it on her lap and starts mixing a flesh tone... \n", "test1_input": "MARGARET Well... he's more established. \nDEE-ANN Please! Is that you talking, or did you just turn into a little felt puppet with someone's hand up your ass? Margaret is befuddled. Dee-Ann scopes out the artwork. \nDEE-ANN It's strange... Walter doesn't strike me as the cute hungry kitten type... Margaret grimaces. \nMARGARET Thanks for coming. Margaret grabs a drink and hurries away. Dee-Ann stands there, irked. Margaret cuts over to Walter. We MOVE IN TIGHT ON THE COUPLE. He grins and grabs her. \nWALTER Ah, my sweet! Are you enjoying the scene? (he gives her a kiss) \nEVERYONE! \n(MORE) \nWALTER (CONT'D) Give a hand to my beautiful wife. Without her, none of tonight would be possible! The crowd APPLAUDS politely, condescendingly. Margaret smiles strangely. The Tipsy Man leans in. \nTIPSY MAN Your husband's quite a talent. \n(PLEASANT) Do you paint, too? Margaret freezes up, terribly awkward. \nMARGARET I don't... know. \nAT WALTER A NOSY GUY corners him in front of a painted child. \nNOSY GUY I'm curious about your technique. How long did that piece take to execute? \nWALTER That? Oh, wow. Probably... months. First the thinking, the sketching, and then time with just me and the oils. \nNOSY GUY \"Oils\"? But isn't that acrylic...? Huh? Walter glances at the painting, startled. \nWALTER Oh --! You mean that painting! Uhh, sorry! It's like a jumble of ideas, rattling around in my brain! Beat. \nNOSY GUY So where do you get your ideas? \nWALTER What do you mean? \nNOSY GUY I mean -- (confused at this confusion) Why are they... images of children? Yikes. Walter starts to sweat. He didn't think this through. \nWALTER Well, er, I've just always loved kids. Though mostly I was influenced by my darling daughter... An odd beat. \nWALTER I remember when she was a baby... Walter gets a far-off look. \nWALTER Yeah. Cute little thing. I'd stare into those big orbs. Sometimes I'd get out my Brownie and snap a photo... but... that's not subjective. You know? It doesn't capture your feelings. So that's when I started painting her... We hold on Walter, unsure where reality begins and ends... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BERKELEY APARTMENT - DAY \nCU on a fuzzy TV SCREEN: A PRIGGISH MAN is griping. The screen is captioned \"JOHN CANADAY, NY TIMES ART CRITIC\" \nCANADAY (ON TV) Keane's work is completely without distinction. He is not a member of the Society of Western Artists. He has won no awards. He's only noteworthy for his appearances in a certain newspaper's gossip column! \n(EXASPERATED) Mr. Keane is why society NEEDS critics! To protect them from such atrocities! Walter gapes at the TV, outraged. He suddenly grabs a PHONE. \nIN THE LIVING ROOM Jane is BANGING on a closed door. \nJANE Mom! I wanna come in. \nMARGARET (O.S.) Uhh, you can't. Mommy's busy. \nJANE (she BANGS again) Let me in! What are you doing in there? Why's the door always locked? \nWalter enters -- and reacts. He glides over to the girl. \nWALTER Janie, sweetie, you need to respect your mother's privacy. Sometimes grownups need alone time. \n(HE WINKS) Is that the ice cream truck? Why don't you go get yourself a fudgesicle? Walter tosses her a dime. She peers warily, then leaves. He waits a beat -- then pulls out a KEY. Walter discreetly unlocks the painting room. \nINT. APARTMENT PAINTING ROOM - SAME TIME \n", "test1_true": "WALTER Whew! Out of this world...! \nMARGARET \n(BOTHERED) I dunno. I'm not really comfortable with this. Jane and I used to be so close... but -- now... \nWALTER Ah, Jane's grand! She's eating ice cream! She has new shoes. She has a college fund. Beat. \nMARGARET Maybe I'm lightheaded from the turpentine. I've been in here all day. \nWALTER Well I don't want you feeling like a prisoner. Take a break! Walter glances at one PAINTING -- then does a take. \nANGLE - PAINTING It's a child in a rusty alley, staring, aching for compassion. And, starting to cry. A single tear streams down her cheek. \nWALTER Is that a tear...? You've gone deep! Margaret bites her fingers, worried. \nMARGARET Do you -- like it? \nWALTER I love it! ...How'd you get the eyes so lifelike? Is it the highlights? \nMARGARET \n(PROUD) No. The secret is the shadow. I shadowed the eyelid. Margaret smiles shyly. Walter smiles back, full of warmth. He takes her face in his hands. \nWALTER I owe you an apology. I was initially dismissive of your kids, those emotion- wrenching blobs of humanity... but they have a real strength. \nMARGARET \n(SHE LAUGHS) Is that your best version of sincerity? \nWALTER I'm trying! Ah, you know me. See -- this is why I need your help! I want to go on tv, to defend our art. \nMARGARET You're going to be on television?! \nWALTER Yes! But... what will I say?? \n(BEAT) Meaning -- what compels me... to paint... these paintings?? A bizarre pause. The two of them look around the room. At all the Big Eyes peering down at them. \nMARGARET Maybe you have an unhealthy obsession with little girls. \nWALTER Cute. \nMARGARET \n(SHE SNICKERS) I guess you've painted yourself into a corner. \nWALTER Funny! Keep 'em coming! You're a regular Steve Allen. You want heat this winter? Help me out! \nMARGARET Walter... art is personal. Walter picks up a picture of TWO LITTLE GIRLS IN TUTUS. He stares, perplexed. \nWALTER What would make a grown man paint a picture like this?! No answer. He thinks of stories, wheels spinning. \nWALTER I grew up, surrounded by six sisters. \n(NO GOOD) I grew up in an orphanage? \n(STRUGGLING) I grew up... in a world where adults had vanished, and children and kittens ran wild over the desolate landscape! Margaret smiles. \nMARGARET What about your Paris street scenes? Why do you paint those? \nWALTER Well, because... I lived it! I experienced it! \nMARGARET (calling his bluff) And was it really all sun-dappled streets and flower vendors? Huh? Walter stares off at the Waifs. They peer out from broken windows... chain-link fences... And then -- he gets it. \nWALTER Well -- NO! Of course not. It was after the War. There was destruction everywhere... \n(PAUSE) \n(MORE) \n", "test1_id": 3, "test2_input": "WALTER (CONT'D) I traveled the Continent. The ravages were horrifying... \nCUT TO: \nINSERT - FULL FRAME TV SCREEN Walter is on TV, on a LOCAL PUBLIC AFFAIRS SHOW. He's coated with makeup, sitting rigidly, fingers gripping his chair. \nWALTER (ON TV) My psyche was scarred in my art student days. Nothing in my life has ever made such an impact as the sight of the children: War-wracked innocents, without homes, without parents, fighting over garbage... He sits in a half-circle of PROPER WOMEN, who are spellbound. \nWALTER (ON TV) Goaded by a frantic despair, I sketched these dirty, ragged little victims... with their bruised minds and bodies, their matted hair and runny noses. There my life as a painter began in earnest. Walter sadly looks up to the HOST. The man is shellshocked. Mute. Walter waits, then sighs. \nWALTER (ON TV) The insane, inhuman cruelty inflicted upon these children cut deeply into my being. From that moment on, I painted the lost children with the eyes. Those eyes that forever retained their haunting quality. The ladies are stricken. A few dab their eyes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO - DAY \nKeane posters get RIPPED off a wall. RIPPED off a mailbox. PULLED off a construction site! \nEXT. KEANE GALLERY - NEXT DAY \nWalter strides along, a bounce to his step. He reaches the gallery -- then stops, dumbfounded. It's PACKED with PEOPLE! Not rich, but regular folks, gawking at the art. \nWow. A sweet moment... then some TOURISTS see Walter and happily accost him: \"Walter Keane!\" \"Mr. Keane!\" They thrust papers and POSTERS at him to autograph. Walter grins and scribbles his signature. Glancing over their shoulders, he sees Ruben down the block, standing outside his own gallery. Gaping in disbelief. Walter chuckles... then flips him off. Ruben's face falls. \nINT. KEANE GALLERY - SAME TIME \nWalter pushes through, shaking hands, greeting the CUSTOMERS: \nWALTER Good afternoon! Delighted! (he reaches the SEXY BLONDE CLERK and pinches her ass) How many sales today? \nBLONDE CLERK \"Sales?\" None with this crowd. Walter's smile drops, surprised. \nBLONDE CLERK These people are looky-loos! They can't afford the paintings. But we gave away a heap of posters! Huh? Walter peers, baffled. Suddenly -- a loud FRWWIPPPP! Walter whirls, startled. Outside, two GIRLS tear a big poster off the front window. Walter's eyes widen. Slowly, he turns back. At the counter, FOLKS and KIDS are grabbing free posters from a box. Walter stares. Processing this. And then... being struck by an idea of absolute genius... \nINT. STORAGE ROOM - SECONDS LATER \nWalter is on the telephone, peering through the doorway. Hiding from the customers. Spying. WHISPERING. \nWALTER (ON THE PHONE) It's the craziest thing. I started charging for the posters! First a nickel... then a dime. (struggling to whisper) YES, Maggie! It's cuckoo! So it got me thinkin': Would you rather sell a $500 painting, or a million cheaply- reproduced posters?! (he LAUGHS, exultant) \n(MORE) \nWALTER (ON THE PHONE) (CONT'D) See, folks don't care if it's a copy. They just want art that touches them! \nCUT TO: \nANIMATION \nWALTER'S VOICE And then... we could sell it anywhere!! EVERYWHERE! 60's-style MADISON AVENUE GRAPHICS: A still of a HARDWARE STORE. Mops, light bulbs, then -- BING! -- framed KEANES. A PHARMACY. Aspirin, candy bars -- BING! -- framed KEANES. A GAS STATION. Tires, motor oil, and -- BING! -- KEANES. \nINT. SUPERMARKET - DAY \nAn aisle of Sundries: Plastic toys, beach balls... Waifs. A sign says \"WE HAVE KEANE!\" Around the corner, Margaret shuffles along, listlessly buying banalities: Cereal. Soap. She turns the cart... and runs into her wall of teary-eyed kids. Margaret peers, muddled. Then she turns away -- to a RACK OF PAPERBACKS. They offer fast hope, inspiration. Margaret seems disconnected. She runs her hand down the options... a book of Numerology... a book on Judaism... an Edgar Cayce prophecies manual... AT THE REGISTER - Margaret gazes up. The CASHIER is a sad Beatnik Girl. In a haze, Margaret notices the whole market is full of LONELY WOMEN: One LADY is her doppelganger -- same age, blonde, gripping a cart. Next aisle over, a MIDDLE-AGED WOMAN stares into space. Nearby, a YOUNG MOM wrangles her children. We shift to Margaret. Face gaunt. Eyes empty. Troubled... \nINT. APARTMENT PAINTING ROOM - DAY \nCurtains drawn, Margaret frantically SKETCHES. She's cabin feverish. In her robe. Hair dirty. And -- up to something. These sketches aren't squat children with round eyes. They're different: Figures with long lines. Margaret frowns and rips the paper. She tries again! Another angular figure -- straight fingers... no! Again! A woman... reclining. Then an indication of a face: A slash... and then -- two small almond shapes for eyes. \nHmm. Margaret's face brightens. She likes it. \nLATER Margaret rabidly paints. Spurting globs of color. The woman is blonde, almond eyes cool, lips curled with mystery... Margaret glances in a mirror. It's a self-portrait. It's Margaret, aloof. Alone at a table. Suddenly the door opens. Margaret GASPS, startled, and spins the canvas away. Walter barges in, dressed like a million. He HALTS -- making a sour face. \nWALTER Whew! Something smells in here. You should open a window. Margaret blinks, a bit dazed. \nMARGARET What time is it? \nWALTER I dunno. 6:30, 7? ...Didn't Janie get dinner? Margaret shrugs. Walter leans in. \nWALTER When's the last time you washed your hair? \n", "test2_true": "WALTER (he notices the turned canvas; he's intrigued) What do you got back there? Lemme see. \nMARGARET No --! It's just... something I'm working on. It's not for the world. Walter gives her a funny look. \nWALTER \"The world\"? Baby, it's me! (stepping forward, a bit \nMALEVOLENT) I'm your number one fan. \nMARGARET No, please! Walter, it's -- personal. \nWALTER \n(GETTING CLOSER) But we're husband and wife. We shouldn't have secrets... Margaret gulps, fretting. Finally, without options -- she flips over the canvas of the lonely blonde. And -- Walter is taken aback. His eyebrows raise, shocked. Margaret bites her lip. Will he go ballistic? \nANGLE - WALTER He leans right up to the painting. His expression is inscrutable. Studying the technique. We have no idea what his emotion is. \nWALTER It's a completely different style. \nMARGARET Yes it is. \nWALTER \n(BEAT) It looks like you. \nMARGARET It's a self-portrait. Beat. \nWALTER How am I gonna explain that? She shifts about. \nMARGARET I thought... maybe... I could sign it myself. Hmm. Walter's eyes narrow. \nWALTER That seems a bit confusing. \"Keane\" means me. \nMARGARET Yes, I know... but... when people ask me if I paint, I don't know what to answer! I just want the pride of being able to say -- that's mine. Walter's wheels are ratcheting. \nWALTER Who'd you tell about the Big Eyes? \nMARGARET Nobody! \nWALTER \n(PARANOID) Was Dee-Ann here?! Did Dee-Ann see this painting?! \nMARGARET No! NOBODY saw it! \nWALTER You tell anybody, the empire COLLAPSES! Do you wanna give back the money? We've committed FRAUD! \nMARGARET I KNOW! My God! I live with this every minute of my life! \n(IMPASSIONED) Janie used to have a mother who painted. Now what's she think?! I lock myself in this room ten hours a day... and then you walk out with finished paintings! He scowls, offended. \nWALTER Janie thinks I'm in here, painting. \nMARGARET C'mon! You haven't picked up a brush in months! (starting to sob) We used to paint together! Easels next to each other, side-by-side -- \nWALTER That was the honeymoon period! Margaret breaks into tears. Walter tenses. \nWALTER Jesus, you're so fragile. \nMARGARET I've kept my end of the bargain! I've never told! (she SOBS harder) Please! Just let me have this! Walter recoils, unable to take this. He relents. \nINT. APARTMENT LIVING ROOM - ANOTHER DAY \nAnother PHOTO OP, but big: A CAMERA CREW rushes about. Lights get set-up. Walter, Margaret, and Jane work at easels. Walter dabs at a Big Eye. Margaret works on a sad, long-neck blonde. Jane paints a goofy flower, like any child. Dick Nolan takes notes. \nDICK So you're now called \"The Painting Keanes\"? \nWALTER Yep! Walter and his girls! With galleries in three cities! \nDICK I had no idea Margaret painted. \n", "test2_id": 4, "test3_input": "STOP IT! He lights ANOTHER MATCH. \nWALTER You like making me look bad?? You enjoy people laughing at me??! He PUNCHES the wall, then tosses the match. Fwoosh! \nMARGARET Walter! He throws ANOTHER MATCH. \nWIDE Margaret grabs Jane and starts running. They rush into the blackness. Walter squints woozily, then starts to CHASE -- \nINT. HALLWAY \nThe ladies run for their lives. Violent THUDS behind them! Something SMASHES. Margaret reaches the Painting Room. She YANKS Jane inside, then SLAMS the door! Walter staggers up. \nWALTER \nLET ME IN! \nINSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret LOCKS the door. She backs away. \nINT. HALLWAY \nWalter tugs the door. He POUNDS it, crazed. \nWALTER Lemme in, you BITCHES!! \nINSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret and Jane shudder. All around them, Big Eyes stare down from above. \nINT. HALLWAY \nIn his haze, Walter remembers the hidden key. Raging, he drunkenly pulls over the chair, then stands on it. But he's too wobbly -- and falls. Bam! \nWALTER Ow! \nINSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM Margaret hugs Jane. \nJANE Mom, what are we gonna do??! Margaret thinks. \nINT. HALLWAY \nWalter laughs crazily and lights another MATCH. It flickers. \nWALTER You got all that paint and turpentine in there? Well I'm gonna burn you up! He pushes the lit match through the KEYHOLE. \nWALTER You're gonna blow like an atom bomb! \nINSIDE THE PAINTING ROOM The match drops on the floor -- then goes out, harmless. That's it. Margaret makes a decision. \nMARGARET We're leaving. Determined, Margaret runs to the curtained wall. She whips it aside -- revealing the sliding glass doors. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MINUTES LATER \nWalter is lighting another match -- when he spins. Through rheumy eyes, HEADLIGHTS orbit across the front window. He peers, confused... \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - DRIVING - NIGHT \nMargaret and Jane drive fast. Adrenaline pumping. Lights of the city flash across their faces. \nMARGARET I'm sorry I wasn't the mother I could have been. I -- I should have done this years ago... \nJANE But where are we going? \n(FLUMMOXED) We don't even have any clothes! \nMARGARET Where we're going, we won't need much. \n(LONG PAUSE) Hawaii. Jane freezes, not sure whether to believe. \nJANE Really...? Margaret smiles softly. We slowly PUSH IN to her. \n", "test3_true": "(GENTLE) And... we're going to make a new life for ourselves. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY \nHawaii, paradise indeed. A dense, tropical forest of deep greens and giant blooming flowers. Margaret stands on the porch of her small, lovely house, breathing in the clean air. She looks lightened. In a clearing, Jane plays with some LOCAL TEENS. \nINT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - SAME TIME \nThe house is simple. In one light-filled corner is an EASEL. Margaret is painting Nature: Splaying ferns. Wild succulents. In the window, a BIRD flies by, its plumage a dazzling red. Margaret thinks -- then takes out a tube of RED PAINT. She starts to apply the vivid color onto her canvas... When -- a RINGING PHONE. Margaret reacts, startled. This is unexpected. And unsettling. It RINGS. RINGS. RINGS. Finally, she hurries to her one telephone, mounted on the kitchen wall. She slowly answers it. \nMARGARET Hello? \nWALTER (O.S.) Maggie --? She freezes. \nINTERCUT: \nWALTER ON THE PHONE - WOODSIDE He is strangely controlled and forboding. \nWALTER Boy, you were sure hard to track down. Thought I might never find you... (a menacing chuckle) I'm a little agitated. I got the strangest papers in the mail today. Margaret tries to stay cool. \nMARGARET It's a decree of legal separation. I would appreciate if you signed it. \nWALTER Aren't you acting too rash? \nMARGARET Walter, our marriage is over. \nWALTER Granted, our romance may have seen its better days. The bloom is off the rose. \n(BEAT) But I'm looking out for both of us. What about Keane Incorporated?! We're a professional couple. Like Roy Rogers and Dale Evans. \nMARGARET Walter, I want a divorce. \nWALTER Whew. It hurts to hear you say those words. Silence. He is feigning \"hurt feelings.\" Struggling for a response. Finally, his thoughts sharpen up, smart and shrewd. \nWALTER I sure hate that it's come to this. \n(BEAT) Well... I SUPPOSE I can agree to a split -- as long... as you assign me all rights to every painting ever produced. \nMARGARET If that's the price. \nWALTER Really?! \nWalter is surprised. Greedy, calculating, he wonders if he can push her further... \nWALTER Uh -- okay. And... then, we have to consider future revenue stream. \nMARGARET My God, Walter! How much more money do you need? \nWALTER It's -- the marketplace! I gotta stay fresh. Surely you understand? \n(DEADLY) You want me out of your life, here's my term: You'll have to paint me 100 more waifs. 100 more Walter Keanes! Margaret's face drops, pained. But she doesn't object. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HAWAIIAN HOUSE - DAY \nMargaret loads BUNDLED, WRAPPED PAINTINGS into a dusty pickup truck. Jane comes running by, barefoot. \nMARGARET Would you like to go into town? I'm stopping by the post office. \nJANE No, I'm gonna surf with the gang. Margaret tightens up. \nMARGARET Your friends are a bit... wild. \nJANE \n(SHE SNAPS) Loosen up, Mom! You're impossible! You move me all the way to Hawaii. Then I actually make some friends, and all you do is complain about them. \n", "test3_id": 5}

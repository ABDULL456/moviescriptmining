FULL SCREEN - TV MONITOR 
Finally: the film that Storm shot that night seven years ago on the wharf. Spliced with the audiotape -- with subtitles including each speaker's name to make every word and identity clear. We see: 
The two Shadow Men step from the station wagon. The "pushed" film clearly reveals them to be Trent and Holland. We see them conspire with Calabrese and Vitale. 
CALABRESE (V.O.) Murder is a serious business, my friend. And an expensive one.

TRENT (V.O.) I'm up to here with caution! This (bleep) lives on alfalfa sprouts and bean curd, he ain't gonna die of natural cause. 
Our SHOT starts to WIDEN, revealing that the TV monitor is in a news studio. The nightly news is being broadcast: what we see on this monitor is simultaneously going out over the air. 
As the SHOT WIDENS and TRAVERSES, we begin to see the actual news set -- including Esposito who got his well- deserved scoop -- and other anchorpeople, crewmen, etc. 
CALABRESE (V.O.) All I'm counseling is a little patience. The man is public. He's in the paper every day. 
TRENT (V.O.) Yeah? Well, the next time I read about him, it better be in the obituaries. 
CONTINUE MOVE as the wharf scene keeps playing. The TV monitor passes OUT OF FRAME, SOUND goes DOWN, we're MOVING PAST the news set and its occupants (who are readying to go back on-camera as soon as the wharf tape ends) and on UP TOWARD -- 
LIGHTS ABOVE NEWS SET 
which now FILL the FRAME -- bright and blinding. The screen starts to bleach out ... it goes white and 
MATCH CUT - SUN (MARINA DEL REY) 
above a perfect peaceful sea. A small powerboat (the kind that you rent from the dock) moves INTO FRAME. Storm steers it, standing up. Andy and Sonny in the back cockpit seat. 
IN ANDY'S LAP - PORTABLE TV 
She switches a channel: up comes the same footage we just saw on the news set. 
ANDY 
It takes a beat before she realizes what it is. Then:

ANDY Hey ... Seven year Storm! (indicates TV) I told you you'd be famous. 
Storm takes a step so he can see the screen.   Views it for a short beat, then -- 
STORM 
picks the TV up from Andy's lap and, while it's still playing, heaves it over the side and into the drink! 
OCEAN SURFACE - TV 
splashes ... bobs for a few moments... then sinks beneath the surface. 
ANDY (laughing) Hey!   Why'd you do that? 
STORM 
watching the last ripples from the sinking set. A moment between him and himself -- when the past is allowed to slip away, sink out of sight, making way for the future. 
Storm turns back from the water surface, to his son and to the woman he loves. He sits (letting the boat drift wherever it wants to) and tugs Andy down beside him. 
Then he reaches across to his son, pulls the boy to him with a playful headlock. 
For a moment both Andy and Sonny are held in suspension, wondering what Storm will do or say. 
Finally: 
STORM (to Sonny) Knock, knock. 
For a beat, the boy is taken aback.    Then he break's into a broad smile. 
SONNY Who's there? 
Storm glances to Andy, pulling her tighter to him.

STORM Boo. 
SONNY Boo who?

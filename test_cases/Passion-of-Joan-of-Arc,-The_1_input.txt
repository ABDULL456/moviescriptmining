Joan cries out and collapses. 
The judges watch her for a moment. Ladvenu full of sympathy. Then Cauchon turns to Massieu and says: 
Go and prepare the instruments of torture! 
Massieu can hardly believe his ears. Are they really going to torture Joan? But a look from Cauchon prevents him from saying anything. He goes out through the door, giving Joan a look of compassion as he does so. 
82   The soldiers, who have witnessed the examination, escort him out, and in the ante-room they reproach and abuse him: 
Why did you make signs to her and give her good advice? 
They threaten to throw him into the Seine if this happens again. 
83   THE PRISON 
The judges leave Joan, Loiseleur being the last to go. Before he leaves the cell he approaches Joan and pats her hair sympathetically: 
Do not grieve ... place your trust in God, he will not forget you! 
Joan turns her tear-stained face to him; full of gratitude for his kind words, she kisses his hand. Then Loiseleur goes out. 
Joan is left in solitude for a mere moment, before the soldiers enter in order to bait her in their usual manner. Joan takes no notice of them. One of them tickles her in the ear with a straw. Joan gets up laboriously and sits down on the bed. One of the soldiers suddenly catches sight of the straw crown. He laughs, picks it up, turns it round in his hands, and finally places it on Joan's head. Outraged by this form of sacrilege, she removes it and puts it on the bed; but the soldier replaces the crown on her head, at the same time giving her several slaps in the face. He steps back and peeps through the hollow of his hand, as if to see her better. 
84   The other soldiers roar with laughter and say in mocking tones: 
She looks just like a daughter of God, eh? 
He takes an arrow from his quiver, and places it in Joan's hands. She lets him do this without resistance.

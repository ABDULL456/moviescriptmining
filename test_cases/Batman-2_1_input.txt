NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VANS are parked in neat rows -- all driverless.  FRICK is sitting with a boxful of electrical equipment next to a bank of ELEVATORS; all the cars have been LOCKED OPEN here in the basement, except for ONE -- PROVOST's private elevator, the doors to which are still closed.  The PENGUIN stands beside it, speaking into a RED PHONE. 
PENGUIN Mr. Provost?  If you want to get out of that car alive, I suggest you follow my instructions to the letter. 
As he talks, we see various NEWSPAPER EMPLOYEES sprawled on the concrete nearby, DEAD.  A CORRUGATED METAL DOOR has been lowered over the LOADING BAY, separating the newspaper production staff from the VAN POOL.  They're trapped on the other side.  BANGING AWAY LOUDLY on the door... 
PENGUIN (cont.) SHUT UP IN THERE. (calmly; into phone) You should see a cord hanging just behind you. 
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT 
PROVOST looks over his shoulder and sees the aforementioned CORD descending through the trap door. 
PROVOST Yes -- yes, I see it -- 
PENGUIN (V.O; filter) Tie the cord to the handle of your box. 
PROVOST lets the phone drop.  He grits his teeth, but hastens to obey.  As he's knotting the cord around the handle of the box, a DINKY BIRD flutters down through the trap and sends him into a panic.  Practically weeping, he reaches for the phone. 
PENGUIN (V.O.; filter) When you're done, I want you to give two sharp yanks on the cord. 
Cowering in terror, PROVOST reaches for the cord and yanks it twice. 
PROVOST Who are you??  Why are you doing this?? 
INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN 
Behind him, FRICK and FRACK are pulling on RED BERETS and BATMAN SWEATSHIRTS -- Order of the Bat gear.  FRICK climbs into a NEWSPAPER DELIVERY VAN and starts the engine. 
PENGUIN Well, Mr. Provost, I guess you could call me an irate reader.  And to be perfectly frank -- I'm doing this because I hate Garfield. 
Chuckling, the PENGUIN holds a SONIC DEVICE up to the mouthpiece of the phone. 
INT. ELEVATOR CAR - THAT MOMENT 
A SHRILL WHINE emanates from the receiver.  All at once, the elevator car is FULL OF BIRDS -- squawking wildly, flinging themselves against the wall, going insane in the tiny confined space. 
PROVOST is screaming like a madman.  The birds are in his hair, his face -- everywhere.  He fights his way over to the panel and begins punching buttons in a frenzy... 
All at once the car PLUNGES DOWNWARD.  It's as if the floor has DROPS AWAY beneath PROVOST's feet -- he's in FREE-FALL. 
INT. LOADING BAY - ON PENGUIN 
PENGUIN Going down! 
He hangs up the phone and steps a discreet distance back from the ELEVATOR DOORS. 
INT. ELEVATOR SHAFT - THAT MOMENT 
The RAVEN BOX dangles from its cord in FG as the CAR rockets uncontrollably downward.  A steady stream ot BIRDS are making a quick exit from the trap door in the roof... 
INT. TOP-FLOOR LANDING - THAT MOMENT 
The CATWOMAN's on a landing near the stairwell, just below the dormer that leads to the roof.  She pries open a pair of ELEVATOR DOORS... 
...and a FLOCK of BIRDS pours out of the empty shaft, making for the open ACCESS DOOR a half-story above.  She reaches inside, finds the cord attached to the RAVEN BOX, and reels it in. 
She rips off the lock and opens the box for a quick look at her trophy.  It's there, all right -- another RAVEN just like the first two.  An awful CRASH, from twenty-five stories down, RATTLES THE SHAFT... 
She makes a disgusted face, grabs the RAVEN, and bolts for the roof. 
EXT. ROOFTOP ACROSS STREET - ON BATMAN 
He watches in puzzlement as a VAST FLOCK OF BIRDS takes flight from the Globe roof across the square.  Something weird is definitely going on.  He's about to abandon his post -- 
-- but down below, the CAROLERS have stopped CAROLING.  The big tree's about to be lit, and they're counting off the seconds: 
CROWD Ten!  Nine!... 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - CORNER NEWSTAND 
A ramshackle kiosk at street level.  The NEWS VENDOR has stepped out onto the sidewalk to watch the tree festivities. A GLOBE DELIVERY VAN, its side bearing the "BATMAN -- HERO OR MENACE?" advertisement, cruises past and dumps a bundle of papers on the curb. 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON CROWD AT TREE 
EXCITEMENT is BUILDING as the seconds tick off: 
CROWD ...Three!  Two!  One! 
The CHRISTMAS LIGHTS come on, and the CROWD breaks into CHEERS.  The ORCHESTRA strikes up a sprightly version of "JINGLE BELLS." 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON NEWSTAND 
The NEWS VENDOR is applauding and singing along like everyone else when a second newspaper van rumbles past... 
NEWS VENDOR Hey!  No!  I aleady got a -- 
He spots TWO MASKED MEN in the doorway of the van -- wearing RED BERETS and BAT-SHIRTS.  They shove a BODY out the door -- 
The mutilated corpse of HARRISON PROVOST lands on the sidewalk with a THUD -- right beside a bundle of NEWSPAPERS which read "BATMAN MURDER SPREE BAFFLES POLICE." 
EXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - ON VAN - MOVING 
The NEWS VENDOR chases after the VAN, but it's already rounded a corner and is cruising along the periphery of Gotham Square. The CROWD is still singing merrily, unaware of its presence -- 
-- until the BACK DOORS fly open -- and a swarm of RABID, CHITTERING BATS screech out into the midst of the crowd!!

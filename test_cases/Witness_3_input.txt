CUT TO: 
DOOR  MEN'S' ROOM 
The diffused shape of faces behind the frosted glass of the Men's room door, which is pushed open to reveal, JOHN BOOK, who comes striding through to be momentarily lost in the crowd of police, reporters and others. He is about 40, with a rangy, athletic body. Behind him comes CARTER, Book's black partner  about five years younger than Book. Book is wearing a suit, Carter is much more casually  almost disreputably  dressed. 
CUT TO: 
BENCH 
Little Samuel watching Book, back to crowd of police, as Book questions an old black CUSTODIAN. 
BOOK You found the body? 
CUSTODIAN Uh uh. Not me, daddy, I just reported it. It was the kid. 
BOOK What kid? 
CUSTODIAN How'n hell do I know what kid? The kid in the funny black threads. 
TIGHT SHOT  SAMUEL 
Worry-eyed, still staring straight ahead. Then his eyes move suddenly to his left. 
BOOK'S LEGS  SAMUEL'S POV 
Coming in at full stride, then stopping. 
SAMUEL 
He doesn't raise his eyes... just looks at the legs. And, slowly, the legs begin to bend at the knees. We see Book's belt buckle, then his big pistol in its holster, then his face. He stares at Samuel for a moment, then... 
ANGLE  BOOK 
As his face breaks into a big grin, and... 
BOOK Hi, kid. 
RACHEL 
Immediately alarmed, intervening. 
RACHEL What do you want of my son? 
THE SCENE 
As Book takes out his wallet, displays his shield. 
BOOK I'm a police officer. I'm going to have to talk to the boy. What's his name? 
RACHEL Samuel. Samuel Lapp. (then, quickly) But what happened here is none of his affair. My sister is expecting me... our train is leaving soon. 
BOOK There'll be another train. (turns to Samuel) The man who was killed tonight was a policeman, Sam. It's my job to find out who did it. I want you to tell me everything you saw when you went in there. 
SAMUEL (stammers) I saw him. 
BOOK Who'd you see? 
Sam looks at his mother. 
BOOK Who'd you see, Sam? The man on the floor? 
SAMUEL No... I saw the man who killed him. 
Book stares at him in surprise, speaks over his shoulder to Carter. 
BOOK Anybody know about this? 
CARTER I didn't even know about it. 
BOOK (back to Sam) Okay, Sam. Can you tell me what he looked like? 
SAMUEL (groping, touching his clothes and pointing at Carter) He was... like him. 
BOOK (nods) Black... I understand. What else,Sam? 
A beat, then Sam crosses quickly to Carter, Book's rather slightly built partner: 
SAMUEL Not Zwartich, like him  
Book frowns, puzzled: 
BOOK Try that one again, Sam  
Samuel gives his mother a helpless look; exasperated, Rachel intervenes with Book. She glances at Carter: 
RACHEL May I talk to you?

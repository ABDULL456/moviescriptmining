The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display. He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures huddled around them. He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively covering his face. Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms. 
KYLE I got you! Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening. The creatures have stopped coming at him. In fact, they're just standing there watching him.   Waiting. Kyle freezes.   CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly wrong. 
YOUNG BOY (O.S.) Mister... Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms.   GHOSTLY WHITE EYES stare back at him. 
YOUNG BOY 
(WHISPERS) Fooled ya. 
A FLASH OF TEETH AS KYLE'S THROAT IS TORN OUT. Kyle drops to his knees. Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls. 
AUDREY Kyle! 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME 
Bob kicks over a table in disgust. 
BOB Damn it all to hell! 
CHARLIE Oh, no.   Audrey... Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and run towards Kyle. 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME 
The young boy stands over Kyle, silently watching the life drain from his body. The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears suddenly appear in his eyes. He opens his arms pleadingly to her. 
YOUNG BOY I'm sorry!     I didn't mean to! 
AUDREY Fuck you! Audrey raises the 45 and ...     CLICK.   CLICK.   CLICK. She keeps pulling the trigger.    Nothing. The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an eerie calm for someone so young. 
YOUNG BOY You're gonna die now. The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body. Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the diner. Blocked by advancing creatures. They're everywhere.    She's trapped. She notices the open door to the MINIVAN.     And so she BOLTS. Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK! She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows. A nightmare come to life. 
INT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME 
Panic. Charlie rushes to Michael's side. 
CHARLIE Do you have no heart?!     She's just a kid! But he's immovable. 
CHARLIE You can't let her die! (grabbing a gun from the 
TABLE) I swear if you don't do something, I will! Charlie COCKS the gun, moves toward the door. 
MICHAEL Wait. 
Charlie looks back at him, defiant.   No one breathes.   Then: 
MICHAEL (raising his guns) Open the door. Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed Charlie and out into hell. 
EXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS 
With stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps. IN THE MINIVAN, Audrey screams as the windows begin to CRACK. She's running out of time. Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at the minivan. What's he up to? The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if they've just now noticed him. And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait, there's more to this trick. Up comes Michael's Glock in his other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The spray of gas EXPLODES into a SPRAY OF FIRE! The MINIVAN is engulfed in flames. Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through the night. The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of glass. Michael drops the gas pump. He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and unlocks the door. Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED

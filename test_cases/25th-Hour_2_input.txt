^V- ^       Doyle snarls. Simon repockets the money.

SIMON 
Okay, okay. I'm just saying, I'm not looking for a mercy pop. 
MONTY 
I'm over, man. Simon points at a line of scabs that run along his throat. 
SIMON 
Cut myself shaving this morning -- four times. Can't keep my hands steady. Come on, Monty, help me out. I can't go to Harlem. Look at me--- they'll eat me alive up there. Monty finally stands and walks toward the man, closer and closer until their faces are inches apart. 
MONTY 
You need to leave me alone, friend. I told you, I'm out of business. Doyle sniffs Simon's boots, then raises his head, snout climbing the man's leg. Simon dances a half-step, trying to keep away from the pit bull without provoking him. 
SIMON 
You worried about me narking you out? You know who I am. 
MONTY 
You're not listening to me. I got touched. Game over. Simon blinks, tries to JLaugh, looks behind him,,,looks down at Doyle, rubs his nose with the back of his hand. 
SIMON 
Five years I've been coming to you. All right, all right, I'm leaving. There's no need to be nasty. Monty and Doyle watch the man go; they begin walking in the opposite direction. They pass the concrete chessboards, the sandboxes, and pause for a moment by a basketball court. Six TEENS play -- with little skill -- one last game before school. Monty shakes his head disdainfully, watching one player dribble at the top of the key. 
MONTY 
You got no left.

The player drives right and misses an open lay-up. Monty spits and continues walking, Doyle leading the way. 
EXT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL -- LATER 
Monty looks up at the old private school, tucked away on a leafy street on the Upper East Side. Two TENTH GRADE GIRLS look at Monty as they pass by. People are always looking at Monty. Both girls take long final drags on their cigarettes before crushing them out and entering the school. 
INT. CAMPBELL-SAWYER HIGH SCHOOL 
Monty walks down a corridor of the school building, Doyle padding along beside him. STUDENTS, hurrying to their classes, stare at the dog and then at Monty. The bells ring and within moments the corridor is empty. Monty stops before a row of framed photographs. He examines one photograph and smiles. 
INSERT PHOTOGRAPH 
The Campbell-Sawyer basketball team. The players stand in a semi-circle with their coaches. We move in closer on one face in particular: Monty, when he was sixteen, free and easy. We move closer still and the black-and-white face begins to blur. 
ADMINISTRATOR (O.S.) 
,,..   .... Excus.e-.me-,- sir, can I help_ you? 
Monty, lost in a reverie, looks up. The ADMINISTRATOR, a tall, harried-looking woman in her mid-fifties, squints at him through her glasses. 
MONTY 
What? 
ADMINISTRATOR 
Can I help you with something? 
MONTY 
(smiling) No, I don't think so. 
ADMINISTRATOR 
There are no dogs allowed on school grounds.

ADMINISTRATOR 
I really have to ask you to remove the dog. 
MONTY 
(still looking at picture) Look at what a little punk I was. The administrator bends forward and squints at the photo. 
ADMINISTRATOR 
I guess you weren't, the center. 
MONTY 
, Ha ha. Starting point guard. Started on varsity from my first game, freshman year. I still hold the all-time assist record. 
ADMINISTRATOR 
Mm, no, Marvin Ray broke the record last                  ^V year.                                                    mm^ Monty stares at her. She shrugs. 
ADMINISTRATOR (CONT'D) 
I coach the girl's team. Monty turns back to the photo. 
MONTY 
Â·- we* Weire undefeated that" year. 
ADMINISTRATOR 
Really? 
MONTY 
Until I got kicked off the team. After that, they fell apart. Do you know where Jakob Elinsky is? 
ADMINISTRATOR 
Probably in his classroom. Room 301. 
MONTY 
Thanks.

HARRY We never even had a conversation, Norman. 
BETH (O.S.) Harry?  That's bullshit.  We stood right there -- 
Harry covers the mic... 
HARRY She's cracking, Norman. 
NORMAN You didn't say that about the food? 
HARRY I was just in the cafeteria, there's plenty of food in there.  Take a look for yourself. 
NORMAN But why would she -- ? 
HARRY She's lying, Norman.  Just like she lied about fixing your suit. 
Harry uncovers the mic... 
BETH (O.S.) You get it straightened out? 
NORMAN I think so, Beth.  Yes. 
INT.  CAFETERIA 
Norman, sitting at a table, eating a couple pieces of cold chicken. 
A salad, some fruit, and boxes of crackers on the table. 
Beth walks in, carrying a bag of food. 
BETH What's Harry doing with your suit in there? 
NORMAN Fixing it. 
BETH Fixing it?  But I fixed -- (notices the food) Where'd you get all that? 
NORMAN The refridgerator. 
BETH The refridgerator. 
NORMAN It's a pretty common place to look for food when you don't think you have any. 
BETH That wasn't in there before. 
NORMAN We must've had it delivered then. 
BETH Wait a second -- 
NORMAN 1-800-Deepsea delivery.  I hear they're good. 
BETH None of this was here before. 
NORMAN Did you look?  It was on the top shelf. 
BETH No, it wasn't.  I swear none of this was here.  None of it. (beat) You think he hid it?  Earlier.  He must've hid it. 
NORMAN You think? 
BETH You don't believe me. 
NORMAN All I know is I opened that refridgerator -- 
BETH Damn it, Norman.  I swear.  I had a whole conversation with the man when he woke up. 
NORMAN This being after you so carefully fixed my suit. 
BETH You think it's me?  You think I'm saying there was a conversation when there wasn't? 
NORMAN I don't know, Beth.  I wasn't there. 
BETH Damn it, Norman!  He's lying.  Don't you get it?  There is something seriously fucked up going on here -- and he's causing it.  Why can't you believe me? 
TO HER LEFT -- she looks -- HARRY is standing in a doorway, cold, holding Norman's jumpsuit.  He turns away. 
ON BETH -- looking back at Norman, tears rolling down her eyes. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  AIRLOCK 
Harry neatly hangs Norman's jumpsuit under the hook labled: "JOHNSON". Smoothens it out for him. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  CAFETERIA 
ON BETH -- sitting at a table, her face in her hands. 
ON NORMAN -- looking at her, as he closes a box of crackers.  Wraps cellophane over the chicken.  Walks with it over to the refridgerator. Opens it, placing the chicken inside... but he can't. 
INSIDE THE REFRIDGERATOR 
are BOOKS -- neatly lined up on each of the shelves. 
NORMAN -- backs away.  What the hell? 
Norman now looks at the CUPBOARDS.  Goes to them. 
INSIDE THE CUPBOARD 
Books, neatly stacked. 
Norman, panicking, opens each of the cupboards, all of them with BOOKS. 
All of the books are the same.  Entitled: "20,000 Leagues Under The Sea by Jules Verne." 
Norman looks over at Beth. 
BETH What is it, Norman?  Norman? 
She comes to him.  He stands there, bewildered, scared, mind racing. 
BETH Norman? 
Norman paces, frantic almost, running his hands through his hair, trying to think.  Stops.  Turns to Beth. 
NORMAN Page 87. 
BETH What? 
NORMAN Page 87.  "I could never read that far." 
Norman quickly plucks a book from a shelf, turns pages, gets to page 87.  Reads...

Natalie shudders in disgust. She spins around to leave... runs smack into Bernie, spilling her tray of drinks on him. 
NATALIE Oh shit... Sorry... I'm such a klutz. 
Bernie wipes himself off, helps her pick up the pieces. 
BERNIE It's all right. Happens. 
Natalie tries to wipe him down a bit more. 
NATALIE Sorry, this guy... fuckin' hands, you know... 
BERNIE S'okay. You might want to stick around. 
Bernie wiggles his way next to Pinkerton. He gives the stickman a certain look. 
STICKMAN Excuse me, Mr. Pinkerton. You have no hard eight. 
PINKERTON (throwing in a chip) Gimmie a hundred dollar hard eight. 
Bernie just watches as Pinkerton throws the dice. 
STICKMAN Eight the hard way! 
The players go nuts. The stickman taps the felt in front of the shooter. 
STICKMAN Nine hundred dollars to Mr. Pinkerton. 
PINKERTON Parlay! Parlay! 
The Boxman seated at the center looks up at him. 
PINKERTON C'mon. You can take that action. 
The Boxman feigns concern, then nods in approval. 
PINKERTON That's what I'm talking about. None of this low limit bullshit. 
Just as the stickman feeds Pinkerton the dice, Bernie flips a dollar chip over toward the center of the table. Natalie peers between them to catch a glimpse. 
BERNIE Dollar hard eight. 
The chip lands on Pinkerton's parlayed bet. He releases the dice from his stubby little fingers. 
STICKMAN Eight easy! Easy eight! Hard eight comes down. 
The players cry out in defeat. Pinkerton grumbles to himself. He fingers his rail of chips. 
PINKERTON Five hundred dollar hard eight. And press my nine up two units. 
He throws in the chips. The croupier places his bets. The dice are fed back to him. He throws. 
STICKMAN Easy way eight! Eight easy! 
Pinkerton is fit to be tied. After a passing moment of clarity he empties his entire rail. 
PINKERTON Hard eight. 
The entire table stops down for a second. 
PLAYER (O.S.) Way to go, Pinkie! Bet the farm. 
Pinkerton sets his dice carefully and lets them fly. 
STICKMAN Seven out!

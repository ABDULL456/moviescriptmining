(barely audible) 
Jack. 
She touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rose gently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost. 
He seems to be sleeping peacefully. 
But he is not asleep. 
Rose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her. 
ROSE 
Oh, Jack. 
All hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is further away now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go. 
She closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason to even try. 
And then... her eyes snap open. 
She raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the wood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boat is invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She struggles to draw breath, calling again. 
292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to something ahead, turning the tiller. 
293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen to Jack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclasps their hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film. 
ROSE 
I won't let go. I promise. 
She releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade out like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane. 
Rose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. She swims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts to BLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps across the still water. 
294 IN BOAT 14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle. 
LOWE 
(turning the tiller) 
Row back! That way! Pull! 
Rose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her. She is still blowing when Lowe takes the whistle from her mouth as they haul her into the boat. She slips into uncosciousness and they scramble to cover her with blankets... 
DISSOLVE TO: 
295 INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH 
EXTREME CLOSEUP of Rose's ancient, wrinkled face. Present day. 
OLD ROSE 
Fifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us. There were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back. One. Six were saved from the water, myself included. Six out of fifteen hundred. 
As she speaks THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly across the faces of Lizzy and the salvage crew on KELDYSH. Lovett, Bodine, Buell, the others... the reality of what happened here 84 years before has hit them like never before. With her story Rose has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the first time, they do feel like graverobbers. 
Lovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about the diamond. 
OLD ROSE 
Afterward, the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but waith... wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which would never come. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
296 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - PRE-DAWN 
MATCHING MOVE as the camera tracks along the faces of the saved. 
DISSOLVE TO: ANOTHER BOAT, and then ANOTHER, seeing faces we know among the survivors: Ismay in a trance, just staring and trembling... Cal, sipping from a hip flask offered to him by a black-faced stoker... Ruth hugging herself, rocking gently. 
IN BOAT 14: CLOSE ON ROSE, lying swaddled. Only her face is visile, white as the moon. The man next to her jumps up, pointing and yelling. Soon everyone is looking and shouting excitedly. In Rose's POV it is all silent, SLOW MOTION. 
IN SLOW-MOTION SILENCE we see Lowe light a green flare and wave it as everyone shouts and cheers. Rose doesn't react. She floats beyond all human emotion. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
298 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - DAWN 
Golden lgiht washes across the white boats, which gloat in a calm sea reflecting the rosy sky. All around them, like a flotilla of sailing ships, are icebergs. The CARPATHIA sits nearby, as boats row toward her. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
299 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN / CARPATHIA MONTAGE - DAY 
IMAGES DISSOLVE into one another: a ship's hull looming, with the letters CARPATHIA visible on the bow... Rose watching, rocked by the sea, her face blank... seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to the Carpathia's gangway doors... two women crying and hugging each other inside the ship... ALL SILENT, ALL IN SLOW-MOTION. There is just music, so gentle and sad, part elegy, part hymn, part aching song of love lost forever. 
THE IMAGES CONTINUE to music... Rose, outside of time, outside of herself, coming into Carpathia, barely able to stand... Rose being draped wtih warm blankets and given hot tea... BRUCE ISMAY climbing aboard. He has the face and eyes of a damned soul. 
As Ismay walks along the hall, guided by a crewman toward the doctor's cabin, he passes rows of seated and standing widows. He must run the gauntlet of their accusing gazes. 
CUT TO: 
300 EXT. DECK / CARPATHIA - DAY 
It is the afternoon of the 15th. Cal is searching the faces of the widows lining the deck, looking for Rose. The deck of Carpathia is crammed with huddled people, and even the recovered lifeboats of Titanic. On a hatch cover sits an enormous pile of lifebelts. 
He keeps walking toward the stern. Seeing Cal's tuxedo, a steward approaches him. 
CARPATHIA STEWARD 
You won't find any of your people back here, sir. It's all steerage. 
Cal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group, looking under shawls and blankets at one bleak face after another. 
Rose is sipping hot tea. Her eyes focus on him as he approaches her. He barely recognizes her. She looks like a refugee, her matted hair hanging in her eyes. 
ROSE 
Yes, I lived. How awkward for you. 
CAL 
Rose... your mother and I have been looking for you-- 
She holds up her hand, stopping him. 
ROSE 
Please don't. Don't talk. Just listen. We will make a deal, since that is something you understand. From this moment you do not exist for me, nor I for you. You shall not see me again. And you will not attempt to find me. In return I will keep my silence. Your actions last night need never come to light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased. 
She fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed their lives. 
ROSE 
Is this in any way unclear? 
CAL 
(after a long beat) 
What do I tell your mother? 
ROSE 
Tell her that her daughter died with the Titanic. 
She stands, turning to the rail. Dismissing him. We see Cal stricken with emotion. 
CAL 
You're precious to me, Rose. 
ROSE 
Jewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley. 
We see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly love her. 
After a moment, he turns and walks away. 
OLD ROSE (V.O.) 
That was the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inherited his millions. The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol in his mouth that year. His children fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas, or so I read. 
301 ANGLE ON ROSE, at the railing of the Carpathia, 9pm April 18th. She gazes up at the Statue of Liberty, looking just as it does today, welcoming her home with her glowing torch. It is just as Fabrizio saw it, so clearly, in his mind. 
302 LATER CARPATHIA DISCORGES THE SURVIVORS at the Cunard pier, Pier 54. Over 30,000 people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets. The magnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting an amazing tableau. 
Several hundred police keep the mob back. The dock is packes with friends and reletives, officials, ambulances, and the press-- 
Reporters and photographers swarm everywhere... 6 deep at the foot of the gangways, lining the tops of cars and trucks... it is the 1912 equicalent of a media circus. They jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging on them as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions. 
Rose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steerage passengers. Immigration officers are asking them questions as they come off the gangway. 
IMMIGRATION OFFICER 
Name? 
ROSE 
Dawson. Rose Dawson. 
The officer steers her toward a holding area for processing. Rose walks forward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of photographer's magnesium flashes cause them to flinch, and the glare is blinding. There is a sudden disturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running to embrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. The reporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode. 
Rose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes through the jostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in the confusion. 
OLD ROSE (V.O.) 
Can you exchange one life for another? A caterpillar turns into a butterfly. If a mindless insect can do it, why couldn't I? Was it any more unimaginable than the sinking of the Titanic? 
TRACKING WITH HER as she walks away, further and further until she flashes and the roar are far behind her, and shi is till walking, determined.

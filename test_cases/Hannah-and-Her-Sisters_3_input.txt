MICKEY Well, it certainly doesn't look promising. 
Mickey stops at the bathroom door at the other end of the hallway.  He starts to pound it. 
FATHER (offscreen) Who knows what'll be? 
Mickey's father comes back on screen; he's carrying a plate of hors d'oeuvres and an empty glass towards the kitchen. He stops and looks down the hall at Mickey, who's now struggling to open the bathroom door. 
FATHER (gesturing with his hands full) I'll either be unconscious or I won't.  If not, I'll deal with it then.  I'm not gonna worry now about what's gonna be when I'm unconscious. 
MICKEY (pounding on the door) Mom, come out! 
MOTHER (offscreen in the bathroom) Of course there's a God, you idiot! You don't believe in God? 
MICKEY (sighing) But if there's a God, then wh-why is there so much evil in the world? (shrugging) What-- Just on a simplistic level. Why-why were there Nazis? 
MOTHER (offscreen in the bathroom) Tell him, Max. 
Mickey, reacting, hits his forehead. 
FATHER (offscreen) How the hell do I know why there were Nazis?  I don't know how the can opener works. 
Mickey starts pounding the door again as the movie cuts to: 
A beautiful snow-covered church downtown, complete with courtyard and wrought-iron fence.  A pedestrian walks by with an umbrella.  A church choir sings a soaring hymn over the scene. 
The music continues as the film moves inside, where the choir is seen singing behind an altar glowing warm gold.  A fairly large congregation sits in darkened pews as the film cuts to the back, where Mickey, his arms crossed, stands underneath some stained-glass windows, watching and listening to the inspiring music. 
The choir continues to sing as the movie cuts to Father Flynn in his office. 
He picks up some large, heavy books from a shelf near his window and he walks over to Mickey, who's standing near his desk, already holding several tomes.  Father Flynn puts the books on top of Mickey's pile; Mickey, flipping through the top one, awkwardly carries his bundle to the door. 
Next is seen a close-up of a painting of Jesus Christ on the cross, complete with crown of thorns and holy expression. His eyes, especially designed to blink as the lights hit them, open and close repeatedly.  The hymn plays on, loudly, as the camera moves back, revealing Mickey, standing outside a barber shop window, looking at the Christ playing and shuffling from side to side to gets its eyes' 3-D effect. Smaller inspirational pictures border the bigger, blinking Christ.  A barber pole with moving stripes stands nearby; passing traffic is reflected in the window. 
Mickey turns from the window, shrugging, and starts to walk down the street, past a fruit and vegetable store with open- air-displayed flowers, past several briskly moving pedestrians. 
With the hymn still playing, the screen goes black briefly. Mickey opens the door, the light from a hallway illuminating him.  He's just entered his apartment.  He closes the door and walks through his dark foyer; he carries a brown bag. He switches on the light, and walking past his spiral staircase, past several framed pictures on the wall, he makes his way to his living room coffee table.  Mickey pulls a crucifix out of the bag; he looks at it, then puts it on the table near a pile of books and some objets d'art.  He then takes out a copy of the New Testament, putting it on top of the crucifix.  Then out comes a framed picture of a saint.  It too gets put on the growing pile.  But the bag is not yet empty.  Next comes a large loaf of Wonder Bread and a large jar of Hellman's mayonnaise.  Mickey sets them on top of the saint. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. NEW YORK CITY STREET - DAY 
Lee is walking down the street, looking around her.  The sidewalk is fairly crowded with people; the sounds of traffic are heard.  She passes some office buildings, a store's large display window; she stops when she sees Hannah. Her sister is waiting outside the Art Deco fa√ßade of a restaurant; she's looking in the opposite direction.  Lee taps Hannah on the shoulder; Hannah, surprised, turns and gasps. 
LEE (overlapping Hannah's gasp) Hi. 
The sisters laugh and embrace each other. 
HANNAH Hi.  Where's Holly? 
LEE (overlapping) Hi.  She's auditioning for a television commercial.  She said she's gonna be a little late. 
HANNAH (sighing) Oh, yeah?  How's she doing? 
She turns and walks towards the restaurant entrance. 
LEE (following Hannah through the restaurant's doors) Oh, God, you know Holly.  When she's depressed, she's manic.  I think it was a good idea that we invited her to lunch. 
They disappear inside.  The camera follows them, cutting to the restaurant's interior at the same time the sisters walk in.  It's a chic, trendy place, with an Art Deco design and high ceilings.  A waiter in uniform stands near its glass and metal doors, holding a tray to his chest; a few people sit at the bar; a large plant in a vase sits in the foreground.  The sisters walk toward the coatcheck area, deep in conversation. 
HANNAH (pulling off her scarf, still on the subject of Holly) I hope you tell her it was your idea... 
LEE Why? 
HANNAH (overlapping) ...'cause every time I try to be helpful, you know, sh-she gets so defensive. 
LEE (unbuttoning her coat) Oh, Hannah, she's-she's just embarrassed in front of you, that's all. 
Hannah walks offscreen, farther into the coatcheck room. She talks offscreen as Lee alone is seen, reacting and speaking as well.  In the background, a waiter crosses over to the bar, then walks away. 
HANNAH (offscreen) So how are you? 
LEE Oh, me, I'm okay. 
HANNAH (offscreen) Do you miss Frederick? 
LEE No. 
HANNAH (offscreen) I can't believe Elliot and I can't think of someone nice for you to go out with, you know-- 
LEE (interrupting, her voice slightly higher-pitched as she takes off her coat) How are you? 
HANNAH (offscreen) I'm okay. 
LEE (overlapping) You know, how's everything?  You doing okay?  How's Frederick? (laughing) I mean, Elliot. 
HANNAH (offscreen, overlapping) Y-yeah. 
Hannah walks out of the coatcheck room without her coat; it's Lee's turn to disappear and check her things.  Now only Hannah can be seen onscreen as the sisters talk.  In the background, the waiter once again walks over to the bar. 
HANNAH (continuing) Oh, he's fine.  He's-he's, I guess he's fine.  I don't know. (shaking her head, her arms crossed) He's been kinda moody lately, the last few months. 
LEE (offscreen, overlapping) Really? 
HANNAH Yeah.  I-I don't know what's wrong with him.  He's just...kind of distant and difficult. 
LEE (offscreen) Oh... 
HANNAH (overlapping, gesturing) I've been trying to talk to him about it.  He says everything's fine, but I don't know. Automatically, you know, I leap to the worst conclusions. 
LEE (offscreen) Like what? 
As Hannah answers her sister, Holly can be seen entering the restaurant and walking over to the coatcheck area, an unlit cigarette in her mouth, her sunglasses still on her eyes. 
HANNAH (gesturing) I mean, I don't know, he's seeing someone else or something, but... 
LEE (walking back onscreen without her coat, reacting) Oh, no!  I mean, everyone thinks things like that.

{"train": "\"WAR OF THE WORLDS\" \nScreenplay by \nJosh Friedman & David Koepp \nSubmitted by \nTyler \nFINAL MOVIE SCRIPT \n** Resized to fit on minimal number of pages** \n[Showing Pictures of City Life] \nNARRATOR \nNo one would have believed in the early years of the21st century, that our world was being watched by intelligences greater than our own. That as men busied themselves about their various concerns, they observed and studied. Like the way a man with a microscope might scrutinize the creatures that swarm and multiply in a drop of water. With infinite complacency men went to and fro about the globe, confident of our empire over this world. Yet, across the gulf of space, intellects, vast and cool and unsympathetic regarded our plant with envious eyes. And slowly and surely, drew their plans against us. \nEXT. DOCK - CARGO BAY - DAWN \nRay (in his 30s, short hair, rough groomed, almost always wears his New York baseball cap, raggedly dressed, looks like he hasn't slept in days) is moving cargo boxes from the ship to ground loading brackets. Shots show him inside the control room operating the levers. As the last car is loaded, he is seen walking down the stairs. \nSAL \nRay!! Ferrier! Whoa! \nRay turns away and laughs because he already knows what he is going to say. \nSAL \nI need you back at 4:00 instead of 12:00 I got half of Korea coming in. \nRAY \nNo, no, no I can't. I'm on a 12 hour blow! Call Tadesko. \nCamera follows them walking down the street. \nSAL \nTadesko can't move 40 containers in an hour. I need somebody who can do double picks. \nRAY \nI wish I could help you Sal. God damn union regulations. \nSAL \n(getting angry) Come on, I'm in a position here! \nRAY \nCome on, you remember the union regulations, Sal. \nSAL \n(angrily) You know what your problem is? \nSal stops on one side of the street while Ray continues walking. \nRAY \n(joking) I can think of a couple of women who'd be happy to tell you. \nEXT. RAY'S CAR - DRIVEWAY - DAWN \nRay gets out and takes the last can of trash to the street as Tim (in his 30s, wearing expensive clothes, slicked sharp hair, extremely well groomed, looks like (and is) rich) and Ray's ex-wife Mary Ann (in her 30s, pregnant with maternity clothes on, hair hanging loose and rather unkempt) stand at their new car. Robbie (15, ragged, tough look, long hair, partially groomed, worn clothes (but looks in style), hip side pack with misc. objects in it.) and Rachel (10, still dressed in Barbie color scheme clothing, long unkempt hair in pigtails) are in the car. \nRAY \nIs it 8:30? We say that? \nMARY ANN \nWe said 8:00. \nRAY \n(changing subject) Hey, this is one safe looking vehicle you got yourself here Tim. Congratulations. \nTIM \nThank You. \nRAY \n8 o'clock huh? \nMARY ANN \nThat why you act like such a dick? \nRay throws the ball and Robbie purposely misses, shattering a window behind him. Robbie turns his hat backwards and walks up the stairs back into the house. Ray stares at Rachel who stares back. \nRAY \nWhat? \nRACHEL \nThat's not how you're going to get through to him. You want him to listen to you... \nRAY \n(interrupts her) What are you? Your mother or mine? \nRACHEL \nWhere are you going? \nRAY \nTo sleep. I work for a living. \nRACHEL \nWhat are we supposed to eat? \nRAY \nYou know, order. \nINT. RAY'S HOUSE - RAY'S ROOM - DAWN \nRay takes off his shirt, seems to loose his cap with it, and takes off his boots as he gets in his bed and goes to sleep. \nINT Ray's House - Living room -  Day \nRachel is flipping TV channels as Ray walks down the hall after his nap. He sits down and sees Rachel picking at a splinter. Rachel has his hard hat on. \nRAY \nWhat's the matter? \nRACHEL \nI got a splinter. \nRAY \nWhere'd you get it. Come here. \nRACHEL \nOn your porch railing. \nRAY \nWhat, you want me to... (beat) You want me to take that out for you? \nRACHEL \nAbsolutely not! \nRAY \nWell, come here let me see it. \nRachel shows him but doesn't let him touch it for fear he may pull it out. Rachel and Ray ad lib as she stops moving it and he looks at it. \nRAY \nIt's gonna get infected. \nRACHEL \nNo it wont. \nRAY \nYes, it's gonna get infected. \nRACHEL \nNo, it won't. When it's ready, my body will just push it out. \nRAY \nPush it out? \nRACHEL \nI want to go inside. \nRAY \nIt's okay. \nRACHEL \nI want to go inside. \nRAY \nOkay, you go ahead. \nThe friend's baby starts to cry... \nFRIEND 2 \nThat's enough weather for me. (begins walking inside) \nRACHEL \nI don't want to go by myself. \nBAM!! BAM!! BAM!!! LIGHTNING hits the ground more rapidly and louder now. Rachel and Ray run towards the eves of the house. BAM! The lighting continues. BAM! \nRAY \nKind of fun, ain't it? \nRACHEL \nNo. \nRAY \nOh, Come on. It's like the fourth of July. \nRACHEL \nNo it's not. \nRay begins singing as... BAM!! The LIGHTNING gets even louder and scares the both of them enough to hightail it for the house. BAM!!! Half the car alarms go off in a 10 block radius. BAM!! Another few car alarms go off. BAM!!! Louder and louder the LIGHTNING continues. \nINT Ray's House - Kitchen - Day \nRay and Rachel are running as fast as they can up the stairs into the kitchen. BAM!! The lighting continues again and makes Rachel scream. \nRAY \nIt's okay. You're fine. \nRACHEL \nIt hit right behind our house. \nRAY \nYeah, well it's not gonna hit there again because lighting doesn't strike twice in the same place. \nBAM!! It hits again and makes Ray jump. \nRAY \nOh, SHIT! \nThey both get under the table for safety as the LIGHTING continues. They both begin panicking. BAM!! BAM!! BAM!! The LIGHTNING goes on with no apparent end. Ray and Rachel both scurry on the floor under the table as the lighting goes on. \nRACHEL \nWhere's Robbie? \nRAY \nI don't know. \nRACHEL \nIs Robbie okay? (no response) Are you okay? \nBAM! The lighting continues. \nRAY \nWhere's the thunder? \nRACHEL \nWhy won't it stop? \nPan out from under the table as the lightning subsides and all is silent. \nYeah. \nRAY \nGood, because your sister is in the house, I want you to go in that house and I want you to stay with her. Okay? (break, as he starts running down the street) And the next time you take my car with no driver's license and no permission, I call the cops. You better be there when I get back. \nRobbie doesn't move in fear. Ray gets angry that he is not going. \nRAY \nRobbie. (snaps his hands together) \nRay begins walking down the street to the auto shop a few yards away. \nRAY \nManny! Manny! Hey Manny. What is it, dead? \nMANNY \nAll of them, everything, look at this... (taps the starter motor) starter's fried. \nRAY \nLightning hit it? \nMANNY \nNot even close. I thought if I changed it... you got any idea what's going on? \nRAY \nI'm on my way to find out. Try umm... try changing the solenoids. \nMANNY \nRight, (to accompanying mechanic) Right see, I told you that, the solenoids. \nEveryone who's car is fried is checking their car to see what went wrong. Ray joins about 30 people walking down to where the lightning started hitting. Ray's friends join him. Cops walk by. \nCOP 1 \nLet us through. Let us through here. \nFRIEND 3 \nHey, what up, Ray? \nRAY \n(joking) I should of known you two were behind this. \nFRIEND 3 \nHey, god's pissed off at the Neibor hood \nRAY \nCan you blame him? \nFRIEND 4 \nYou see it? \nRAY \nYep, you got power where you are? \nFRIEND 3 \nNope, nothing. \nRAY \nIt's the cars though. That's the thing. \nFRIEND 4 \nSolar Flare, that's what this guy told me. \nRAY \nA solar flare? \nFRIEND 4 \nYeah, the sun shoots off blobs of plasma, they turn into solar flare flashes. It's the only thing that can kill all of the electronic stuff. \nFRIEND 3 \nCan I say something? \nThe machine makes a large vibrating noise as if calling out to other robots. It arms it's disintegrator beams and opens fire. People can be seen to disintegrate as they are struck with the beam. The beams, when fired make a zap sound. People start exploding into dust and their clothes are blown away. Ray misses numerous beams by a foot or two as he goes into a convenience store. Again Ray runs out the back door and misses another beam by inches. He runs his ass off trying to escape the robot. Disintegrator beams strike off rooftops to clear a walking path. Ray hides behind a building as the machine walks by. \nEXT. RAY'S HOUSE - PORCH -  EVENING \nRay walks into the house where he is met by Rachel's gawking eyes out the window. Robbie stands in the background looking at the doorway. Ray walks past Rachel then Robbie toward the kitchen. Rachel and Robbie follow him into the kitchen. With anxious eyes, Robbie begins to say... \nROBBIE \nWhat happened? \nRay sits down against the wall of the island countertop in the kitchen, not responding. \nRACHEL \nWhat's going on? \nRobbie squats down next to Ray as Rachel rests her elbows on the stool at the island. \nRACHEL \nDad, what's the matter? \nROBBIE \nWhat's all that stuff all over you? \nRay seems to be delirious as he slurs his head towards Robbie. \nRachel reaches through a leg of the island to pull at Ray's hood on his shirt. BAM! Ray jumps and jerks his head toward Rachel fast enough to make some of the white powder poof off as if jerked back into reality. Robbie jumps as well in fright. \nRACHEL \nWhat's all the stuff? \nROBBIE \nHello? Ray? \nRay looks at his arms which are coated in the white powder. He gets up and begins heading for the bathroom. Still unresponsive to the questions he was just asked. He looks in the mirror to see that he is covered in the whit powder (human ash). He quickly does his best to wash it off realizing what it is. After washing it off, he begins mentally planning what to do. \nWalking back into the kitchen... \nRAY \nWe're leaving this house in 60 seconds. \nRay grabs an old Penzoil box and dumps the tools out of it. He shoves the box into Robbie who grasps it as to not fall over at the force Ray used. \nROBBIE \n(questioning) What? Wait. I have no idea what's going on... \nRAY \n(while Robbie asks) ... all the food from the refrigerator and the cupboard, put it in here. \nROBBIE \nI think we are having a bit of a shock here...what's going on, just tell me... \nRAY \nJust do it. \nRay runs toward the table, grabs a flashlight and begins to try to get it to work. \nRAY \nRachel, sweetheart... \nRACHEL \nDad, you're really scaring me. \nRAY \nI need you to get your suitcase... \nRACHEL \nDad. (break) Dad! \nRAY \nThe one that you brought, bring it to me, okay? \nRay shoves cereal boxes aside to get to the cabinet over the refrigerator for batteries. Hastily grabbing the package, he realizes they are probably dead due to the EMP. \nRAY \nCan you do that for me, darling? \nMANNY \nIt's not my car. It's not your car. Where you going? Daddy's acting crazy kids. Guy's gonna come back... \nRAY \n(interrupts him) I don't have time to expl.... \nMANNY \n(interrupts him) You're busting my chops. I got a shop to run. You know how many people... \nRAY \n(interrupts him) Get in! \nMANNY \nNo, RAY GET OUT OF THE... \nRAY \nGET IN MANNY OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE! \nRachel begins crying as she says... \nRACHEL \nWhat do you mean? \nA dead silent pause falls on everyone. Robbie stares at Ray in fright as Ray and Manny stare at each other. \nMANNY \nAll right, get out of the truck! I'm not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR RAY! \nRachel cries more as a view of an approaching robot shoots flame at a nearby tree. Ray and Manny continue as Rachel looks at the flaming tree. \nMANNY \nI'm not fooling around, I got a busy day ahead of me... \nRAY \n(to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT! \nRay helps Robbie close the door on Manny as they begin speeding away. \nMANNY \nRAY! BRING THE CAR BACK RAY! IT'S NOT MY CAR! \nManny just finishes his line as he is zapped by a disintegrator beam. Camera shows the auto shop zapped by the beam and exploding to smithereens. \nINT. CAR - DUSK \nTrying to outrun the beams... \nRAY \nGET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN! \nRACHEL \nIs this the terrorists?!?! \nRAY \nJUST GET DOWN. GET DOWN! \nRay grabs Robbie's collar of his jacket and shoves him toward the floor. \nRAY \nGET DOWN! \nROBBIE \nHOLY SHIT! \nHigh shot shows the bridge behind Ray's house being blasted away. The expressway gets hit by the beams and overturns into the houses below. One of them Ray's. An explosion is seen as a fuel tanker falls on Ray's house that obliterates 4 houses. Flaming debris flies all over behind the van. \nThe van has now made it on to the freeway where hundreds of cars are scattered all over the road broken down. The van speeds by them honking the horn every few cars. \nROBBIE \nWhere are we going?!?!?! \nRAY \nWe gotta go! We got to be the only working car around here. I'm not stopping until we are clear. \nRachel breaks eye contact and starts controlling her breathing while Robbie grabs her hand as reassurance. \nROBBIE \nWill you hold my hand? \nRACHEL \nYes. \nROBBIE \nAre you gonna be okay? \nRACHEL \n(relatively calm) Yes. \nRobbie grabs her hand and they both lean forward toward the front. \nROBBIE \n(taking a breath to calm himself) I want to know everything you know. \nRay looks into Robbie's eyes who is looking straight forward on the road. \nRAY \nThis thing, this machine, it crawled out of the ground and started torching everything, just killing everybody. \nROBBIE \nWhat is it? (break) Is it terrorists? \nRAY \nNo, this came from some place else. \nROBBIE \nYou mean like Europe? \nRAY \nNO ROBBIE!! NOT LIKE EUROPE!!! \nRay swerves to miss a car as the camera cranes around to the driver's side. \nRAY \nThat machine, it was already buried. \nRay looks into the sky. What for is unknown. \nRAY \nMaybe it came down in the lightning storm. \nROBBIE \nWait a minute... you just said it was buried. \nRAY \nNo, the machine I'm talking about was buried. But, what came down in the lighting storm, what operates it. That's the... that's the.... You know. The.... \nRobbie jumps back into the passenger's seat as Rachel scoots forward in the back seat. Robbie is looking toward the sky. \nRACHEL \nThe what? \nROBBIE \nWhy aren't there any helicopters or airplanes? \nRAY \nHey Rache. How you doing there girl? (to Robbie) How she doing? \nROBBIE \nHow you doing? \nRACHEL \nI'm fine. \nROBBIE \n(to Ray) She's good. \n(begins, and continues once in the house) MOM!! TIM!! \nRay remains in the car realizing how unimportant he really is (kids are shouting for Tim). \nINT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - ENTRY - DUSK \nRachel and Robbie are shouting for \"mom\" and \"Tim\" as Ray walks through the door. Rachel and Robbie meet Ray in the entry from different parts of the house in their search. \nROBBIE \nThey're gone. \nRACHEL \nIs she dead?? \nRAY \nShe's not dead. All right? She's just no here. Okay? They're never here. \nROBBIE \nHow do you know? \nRAY \nBecause they are on their way to Boston.... \nThe camera goes to the phone which is briskly picked up by Robbie. Then the camera views into the new family vacation portrait next to the phone. It has Ray missing who is replaced by Tim. \nRAY \n... and so they just kept on going, they're probably up to your grandma's house by now. \nROBBIE \n(dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her. \nRACHEL \nHow come the lights are on here and not at your place? \nRAY \nUmm.... Because nothing bad happened here. Okay? \nRobbie is having no luck and is only getting error tones out of the phone. \nRAY \nSo, were safe here. All Right? \nRemembering Robbie's calming \"arm\" technique... \nRAY \nOkay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay, you are safe in your area... \nRACHEL \nDad. That's not how it goes. \nRAY \nOkay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get you some food. I'm gonna feed you. Get something to eat.  (digs into the box) What do we have here?? \nROBBIE \n.. Busy signals, one of the fast ones.... You think all the circuits are down? \nRAY \n(continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco, Barbeque Sauce. This is really good Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food. What... What the hell is this? \nROBBIE \nThat's all that was in your kitchen. \nRAY \nOkay. No, it's all right, it's all right. \nRobbie takes his hat off and sits down as Ray searches the box for food. He finds peanut butter. \nRAY \nUh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm.... We'll just get some sandwiches. \nRay takes the twist tie off the bread bag and dumps the whole loaf on the counter. He taps his hands together to try to calm Rachel and Robbie. \nRAY \nROBBIE \nWanna stay here? \nRACHEL \nYeah. Good night, love you. \nROBBIE \nLove you, Rache. \nRay takes out his gun and puts it under a pillow of the sofa as he sits down. So Robbie and Rachel wont notice. \nINT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT \nBushes are heard rattling against the window. They become louder and louder against the window. Eventually they become just shy of loud enough to wake Ray up. FLASH! A strike of lighting gets Ray's eyes to roll back around and open. BAM! The second flash is loud enough to get Robbie (who is now in the seat next to Ray) to jump up next to him. A few more flashes and the lightening starts like the first time. BAM! BAM! Every strike of lighting lights up the entire downstairs. Rachel gets up and looks thought the stairs. \nA close up shot of Robbie. With every lightening strike, his breathing becomes more erratic. \nRACHEL \nIs the lighting back? \nRAY \nNo, this is something else... \nJust as ray finishes, an ear piercing noise from a jet engine begins. The howl rattles things off of shelves on the walls. Robbie and Ray wince at the pain in their ears. Rachel runs up to Robbie and hugs him in security. Things fall off of shelves everywhere. \nA shot of the incredibly bright window as the noise grows even louder. \nROBBIE \n(screams) AHHHH... WHAT'S THAT SOUND? \nRAY \nI NEVER HEARD THAT BEFORE!!! \nRACHEL \nIS IT THEM!!! IS IT THEM!!! \nThe lighting grows more intense as does the sound. \nRAY \nWE GOTTA GO!! WHERE DO WE GO??? ROBBIE, THIS IS YOUR HOUSE, WHERE DO WE GO?? \nRobbie opens the door to the furnace room and shows Rachel down the stairs who runs. Robbie goes back to get Ray. \nRay realizes he has forgotten his gun. \nRAY \nWAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! WAIT!! \nRay and Robbie run to the door just as a fireball bursts through the windows. Flaming debris follows after. Ray gets the first door closed but the fire blasts through the wooden one. He manages, after a struggle, to get the metal one closed on the inside of the furnace room. \nThe door closes and the room is completely black. In the dark, you can hear the debris being thrown around everywhere around them. \nRACHEL \nAre we still alive? \nINT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - FURNACE ROOM - DAWN \nRay is looking out the window at the top of the room. He is holding on to the metal wire conduit. Seeing hardly anything, he judges it to be safe to go outside the furnace room. \nHe walks by Rachel who is sleeping in Robbie's arms who is sleeping against some copper piping. Holding his slightly burned arm in pain, Ray exit's the room through the charred doors and finds most of the basement in ruins. The ground floor is now the top floor because the second floor was completely torn off. \nThe camera pans out to find a winding down, burning airplane engine. Panning out further we can see ray walking through the remains of different sections of an airplane. \nEXT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - YARD - DAWN \nRay sees the fuselage with one surviving person hauling a blue cart through the aisle. \nRAY \nDown here! \nThe man continues hauling the cart. \nRAY \nWere you on this plane? Are you a passenger? \nThe cart comes flying down the fuselage doorway as the man creeps down the floor to the ground. \nMAX (NEWS CAMERA OPERATOR) \nRachel is about 200 feet away entering a patch of bushes. Robbie has already found a spot about 10' away next to the stream under the road. \nRAY \nListen. Every time you don't listen to me, I'm telling your mother, okay? I'm making a list. (reinforcing) I'm making a list! \nRachel is entering the wooded area next to the stream looking for a half way decent spot. She sees the river and looks at it in beauty just as she sees a body floating down it. MORE BODIES start coming at a huge rate. 20,30,40,50 bodies floating down the river. Rachel begins to hyperventilate again as Ray comes up from behind her and throws his hands over her eyes and grabs her. \nRAY \nI told you to stay where I could see you! \nRACHEL \nI'm sorry! \nRay grabs her into his arms and begins walking back to the van. \nArmy trucks can be heard crossing by the van. Robbie, who's only interest is killing one of the robots sees this as an opportunity to do so. Robbie runs toward the trucks and begins shouting.... \nROBBIE \nSTOP!! DO YOU HAVE ROOM??? STOP!!! \nSome trucks pass by as the soldiers in them look at him blankly. \nROBBIE \nWAIT, STOP!!! LET ME ON!!! LET ME ON!!! GIVE ME A HAND!!! \nRobbie is getting soaked as the tank's tracks roll over the large puddles of water. Robbie is not giving up hope that one may let him on. \nROBBIE \nWAIT!!! STOP!!! GIVE ME A HAND!!! YOU HAVE ROOM!!! \nSOLDIER \nWatch it, kid! YOU'RE GONNA GET YOURSLELF RUN OVER!!! \nRay sees Robbie trying to get on with them. He has had enough of Robbie and goes up to him to tell him.... \nRAY \nWHAT!?!?!  ROBBIE, YOU WANT TO GO IN THAT DIRECTION? \nRobbie, who ignores him is still shouting for them to stop. \nRAY \nTHERE'S NOTHING LIVING IN THAT DIRECTION, ROBBIE!!! \nROBBIE \nWHAT DO YOU CARE?!?!? YOU NEVER GAVE A SHIT BEFORE!!! YOU NEVER GAVE A SHIT!!! \nRAY \nOKAY, HARD ASS, WHAT'S YOUR PLAN? YOU'RE IN CHARGE NOW, YOU TELL ME WHAT WE'RE DOING!! \nROBBIE \nWE CATCH UP WITH THESE SOLDIERS, WE PICK UP WHOEVER ELSE ISN'T DEAD AND WE GET BACK AT THEM!!! WE GET BACK AT THEM!! THAT'S WHAT WE DO!!! \nRAY \nWELL, NOW LET'S TRY ONE THAT DOSEN'T INVOLVE YOUR TEN YEAR OLD SISTER JOINING THE ARMY! YOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT??? \nRay and Robbie are about ready to start throwing punches at each other as the tanks continue rolling by. \nROBBIE \nWHY DON'T YOU JUST TELL US THE TRUTH??? \nRAY \nYOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT! \nROBBIE \nYOU HAVE NO IDEA WHICH WAY TO GO!! \nRAY \nYOU HAVE ANYTHING LIKE THAT?!?!?! \nROBBIE \nYOU WANNA COME OFF ALL WISE AND SHIT!! YOU ONLY CHOSE BOSTON BECAUSE YOU HOPE MOM IS THERE AND IF SHE'S THERE, YOU CAN DUMP US ON HER!!! YOU CAN DUMP US ON HER THEN YOU'LL ONLY HAVE TO CARE ABOUT YOURSELF!!! WITCH IS EXACTLY THE WAY YOU LIKE IT!!! \nRobbie is shivering in the cold of his wet clothes but his adrenaline keeps him fighting at Ray. They both can be seen with the air from their nostrils flaring like a bull. Rachel rushes in as an attempt to get Robbie to realize what he's doing. \nRAY \nPlease, all I want is my daughter. \nRIOT MAN 3 \n(surprisingly calm) I'm taking the car. \nRAY \nI just want my daughter. Please just let me take my daughter, can I.... All I want is my daughter. \nRIOT MAN 3 \nYeah. Okay, go ahead, take her, take her, yeah, yeah.... \nRay grabs Rachel out of the car as the riot man gets in the driver's seat and closes the door. \nRAY \nRobbie!! \nRobbie, who has managed to get to his feet, hunched over, walks over to Ray. Ray, with Rachel in his arms, and Robbie walk to the diner on the street. The man backs up the car just as the camera pans down to see a man who sees the gun on the street. The man picks up Ray's gun and looks at the man in the van. \nINT. DINER - DUSK \nThe three of them are walking to a booth in the diner. Ray, with Rachel in his arms, is beginning to bleed from his head wound. He walks with a slight limp. Rachel is panic stricken. Robbie lets go of his bloody nose and, with both hands, clenches his chest in pain. He is still fighting to catch his breath. They are all soaked from the rain. \nThey all sit down at the booth. The power is flickering on and off. As they begin to relax from the ordeal they just had, gunshots are heard. BAM!! BAM!! Ray jumps and catches his head in his hands as it throbs. Robbie jumps and flails his arms in pain as the jump tightened muscles in his stomach. Robbie turns around to see the man with Ray's gun firing at Riot Man 3. BAM! One more gunshot is heard. Rachel scurries over to Robbie who, despite his pain, grabs Rachel and they hug each other seeking comfort. The van drives away. \nRachel sobs as Ray also starts crying because nobody knows what to do from here. Robbie looks at Ray for some comfort. He has none. \nWalking Down the Street - Dusk \nThey are walking in a crowd of about 300. Some men share their stories of assumption. One man says... \"Europe's got it the worst....\" while another man says \"We've got it the worst......\" while some people \"don't give a shit who it is.....\" \nRACHEL \nLooks like the power's still on here. \nRAY \nYeah, power's still on because nothing bad has come up from under the ground. \nA rail road crossing guard stick comes down as the bells and lights start going off. The people stand behind the guard just like cars. They wait. \nA train approaches and is blowing off fireballs from an encounter with a robot. The entire train is flaming and burning. The train, as it whisks by is releasing pieces of red hot ash. The bars go up as the train completes it's crossing. The people continue walking. \nEXT. FERRY DOCK - DUSK \nRandom, pointless music is playing over the PA system as people are being herded by soldiers onto a ferry boat. A blood bank woman says over a megaphone... \nWOMAN \nUnless you are O-positive and Rh negative, thank you but we already have more blood than we can use. Again... (repeats message) \nShots of the herded people boarding the ferry. \nSolders are heard and seen saying \"this way\" and \"keep it moving folks\". \nHARBOR MASTER \nPlease move forward calmly, the boat can make more than one trip. Please move forward calmly, take your time, don't rush. (repeats) \nSHERYL \nRay! RAY?!?! \nRAY \nSheryl? \nSHERYL \nYeah. \nRay and Sheryl hug as they are re-united. \nSHERYL \nOh, my gosh, are these your kids? \nRAY \nYes, this is Rachel. \nSHERYL \nHi, I'm Sheryl, this is my daughter, Nora. \nRay, Sheryl, Nora, and Rachel exchange handshakes. \nRAY \nThere's room on the boat!!! \nSHERYL \nLET US THROUGH GOD DAMN IT!!! \nRAY \nTHERE'S STILL ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! \nRachel screams as Ray runs to the bow with Rachel in his arms. Robbie is soon to follow... \nRACHEL \nROBBIE?!?! \nRAY \nStay with me! Stay with me Robbie!!! \nRobbie runs right past them and up to the captain's deck. \nRAY \nROBBIE!!! \nRobbie, panting hard, looks at the inclining ramp and sees there are still people hanging on to the back side of the ramp. He starts running to the stern of the ship. \nThe captain pushes the throttle all the way full. The propellers start so fast they spray water all over the people still at the dock. Pulling away at it's ties to the dock, the ship begins pulling away. \nRACHEL \n(seeing Robbie running to the stern) Robbie? Robbie!?!?! \nRAY \nRobbie!!! \nRACHEL \nROBBIE!!! \nRobbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded up ramp. Climbing to the top, he begins helping those who are hanging on the back side of the ramp. \nROBBIE \nHere, grab my hand!! Hold on! I got you! HOLD ON!!! \nCamera turns or Ray's face. Ray looks at Robbie helping people in admiration and proud ness. \nROBBIE \nTAKE MY HAND!! TAKE IT!!! \nINT. CAPTAIN'S CONTROL ROOM - DUSK \nThe captain sees some sort of whirlpool sucking water down into a hole. The ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole, being sucked in. \nCAPTAIN \nOh, my god! \nPassengers rush over to the starboard railing where a robot emerges from the whirlpool. WOOSH!!! Hundreds of gallons of water are tossed up with the robot. The water in the air turns to snow as it falls on the ship. The robot's engines howl in the air. \nRAY \n(fearing danger to his son) ROBBIE!!! \nThe robot's claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one side and finally tip over on it's side. Robbie is already running towards Ray. At the turn of the ship, the three go into the water. Cars start coming towards them. WOOSH!!! A car comes right for them. SPLASH!!! The car hit's the water where they are, instantly pinning Robbie and Ray to the front of it. Rachel is holding on to Robbie's back, also going down. \nThe people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water. \nAs the ship completely capsizes, people are thrown or washed into the water. Cars sink down, people float and the ship bobs in the water. Ray is able to un-pin himself and pulls Robbie out. They all begin swimming to the surface. Rachel lags behind and Robbie grabs her and helps her up.  At the surface, they meet. A ship propeller at full power. They begin to swim away from it. Claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and pulling them into the robot's holds. \nEXT. BEACH - DARK \nRay is heaving Rachel up to shore. Robbie is not far behind. They are all fighting to get their breath after swimming for so long. Ray can no longer haul Rachel up the beach. \nRAY \nHelp me. Help me with her. \nROBBIE \n(gagging) Okay. \nRobbie almost slips as he gags, still fighting for breath. \nPulling each other up the hill.... \nRAY \nLISTEN TO ME! \nRachel watches helicopters fire missiles simultaneously over the hill. \nRAY \nDON'T DO THIS! I LOVE YOU! \nROBBIE \nI NEED TO BE HERE! I NEED TO SEE THIS!! \nRAY \nI KNOW IT SEEMS LIKE YOU HAVE TO BUT YOU DON'T!!! \nROBBIE \nLET ME GO!!! \nRAY \nYOU DON'T!!! \nROBBIE \nPLEASE LET ME GO!!! \nRachel is approached by people. They think she's alone so they try to talk her into coming with them (ad lib). \nRAY \nI'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!! YOU CAN HATE ME..... \nRobbie tries to fight to get up but Ray keeps him pinned to the ground. \nRAY \n... YOU CAN HATE ME. BUT I LOVE YOU!! \nROBBIE \nLET ME GO PLEASE!!! \nRAY \nI'M NOT LETTING YOU DO THIS!!! \nROBBIE \nDAD!! \nRay sees the couple trying to get Rachel to go with them. For a second, Ray doesn't know what to do. \nRAY \nJust listen to me! \nROBBIE \nI need to be here! I want to see this! \nRAY \nWait, stay. Stay for Rachel. Stay for your sister. \nROBBIE \nPlease let me go! You need to let me go. \nRay and Robbie are silent for what seems to them like forever. Ray looks to Rachel who is being carried away by the couple. Robbie manages to turn back over to his stomach. After enough trying, Robbie is able to squirm out of Ray's grasp on his shoulders. \nRobbie crawls out of Ray's grasp and stands up. They stare at each other for a while and Robbie begins running over the hill. Ray runs over to Rachel to get her back from the couple. \nRAY \nGET OFF!!! I'M HER FATHER!!! I'M HER FATHER!!! \nWOMAN \nWe thought she was alone... we.... \nShe doesn't finish as she scurries away. Ray looks at the hill where the soldiers were firing at... A FLAMING army truck rolls over the hill. \nRAY \nRobbie?!?! \nTwo more trucks come over the hill ablaze. Suddenly... BOOM!!! A ring of mine charges go off at the peak of the hill. The explosion blast is almost big enough to knock Ray off of his feet. \nSing me \"Lullaby and Goodnight\"? \nRAY \n(shakes his head in displeasure because he can't think of it) I don't remember that one. \nRACHEL \nSing me \"Hushabye Mountain\"? \nRAY \nI'm sorry Rach, I don't know that one either. \nRachel turns over (her back to Ray) because she realizes that it is a lost hope to get a song out of him. Ray thinks for a moment and remembers an old nursery rhyme he was taught. \nRAY \n(begins to sing) I'm not bragging, baby. So don't put me down. Because I've got the fastest set of wheels in the town. Something comes up to me that don't even try.... \nRachel turns back over as Ray continues singing... \nRAY \n(continues singing) ... If I had a set of wings, man, I know she could fly. She's my little deuce coupe. You don't know what I've got... just my little deuce coupe. (now whispering) You don't know what I've got.... \nRachel has fallen asleep. Ray kisses her on the forehead. Harland taps two glasses together and says... \nHARLAND \nPeach schnapps. \nRay gets up and begins walking towards him. \nHARLAND \nDisgusting, I know it. I found a whole case of this shit. \nHarland hands Ray a glass as they both sit down. \nRAY \nThank you. \nSilence falls over for a period. \nHARLAND \nI'm sorry about your son. \nRAY \nWe got separated... he's gonna meet us in umm... in Boston. \nRay drinks the schnapps as he begins to ask... \nRAY \nDid you... (pauses) ... (whispers) Did you loose anybody? \nHARLAND \nAll of them. \nAnother pause. \nHARLAND \n(introduces himself) Harland Ogilvy. \nRAY \n(introduces himself) Ray Ferrier. \nThey shake hands. \nHARLAND \nI got water... Food.... Enough for weeks. You're welcome to stay, both of yous. \nRay gets up from the conversation. \nRAY \nI'm sorry. I'm gonna get some sleep. \nHARLAND \n(speaks loud enough to get Ray to pause) Those machines, those tripods they got... They buried them... right under our feet. Since before there were even people here. They've been planning this for a million years. We're beat to shit. \nRay looks at Harland sternly because he is afraid Rachel may hear what he may say next. \nHARLAND \nYou miss your mommy? I had a little girl nearly your age. You know, if anything happens to your daddy, I'll take care of you. \nRay is very angry that Harland is saying things like that to his daughter. \nRAY \nRachel! \nRachel runs towards him and he points to stand beside him. They both stare at Harland, on the stairs, in dismay. \nRAY \n(distinctly angry, but not yelling) You don't have anything to say to her, do you understand? If you want to talk to somebody, or ask somebody a question, you ask me! \nHARLAND \n(also angry at Ray) What exactly is your plan, Ray? I know what I'm gonna do. How about you? You gonna sit here, wait for them to come get you? Is that your plan? \nHarland walks around to different parts of the basement doing miscellaneous things. \nHARLAND \nMaybe you want to get caught. Couple of days hiding in a basement too much for you, I bet. You'll probably turn yourself right in! \nThe robots outside stop moving. All the rumbling stops. \nRAY \nListen. It stopped. \nHARLAND \n(paying no attention) Maybe you'll be okay. Maybe you'll get lucky and they'll train you as their pet. You know, train you, feed you, teach you how to do tricks... \nRAY \n(yells) WILL YOU SHUT UP AND LISTEN?!?!?! \nPieces of wood fall from the hole as a robot camera comes floating down into the hole. Ray hides behind the stairs. The camera eye opens and lights turn on for it. \nRachel is hiding as well. The camera looks around the couch. Ray moves as to not be seen by it moving around the couch. It sees a rat and quickly follows it for a few seconds. Ray and Harland exchange looks as Ray runs toward Rachel to hide with her. \nThe robot continues checking out the basement. Harland grabs an axe to cut off the camera from it's limb. Ray shakes his head no to get him to stop. Ray silently does expressions to convince him not to. \nHarland goes towards ray so they can hide together. Harland almost makes it before he thuds against a cabinet full of glass containers which clang together. The robot hears this and turns around toward the noise. They run to a different spot. \nRobot gets closer... \nRay puts a mirror in front of the doorway to trick the robot into seeing another robot. The camera looks over the mirror and sees nothing. \nIt turns around just as... Rachel's boot slides, making a noise. The robot views into the boot that is hanging out. It looks behind the mirror to find just a boot sitting there. Ray, Rachel and Harland are in the middle of the basement. A sight of relief comes as the robot camera exit's out of the hole. \nNow the actual aliens come into the basement. Harland turns the lantern out and runs to hide. The aliens look around the basement. They look at, smell, and touch various different things throughout the basement. Ray, Rachel, and Harland scurry to different parts of the basement. \nHarland loads his gun and aims it to fire at one of the aliens but the gun is pulled back by Ray. \nRAY \n(dead silent) Give me that! \nRay and Harland are in a silent fight for the gun. They both have their hands on it. The aliens continue looking around. \nRay and Harland are both sweating bullets fighting for the gun. Still silently.  Harland pins Ray against the wall and forces him down to the ground to try and break the gun free of his grasp. \nThe aliens are seen taking and smelling a photograph from a box. \nRay lets go of the gun and Harland jerks it away from him just as the vibration like noise is heard from the robot. The aliens scurry out through the open hole. \nHarland comes down to Ray, now sitting on the floor, and says.... \nHARLAND \nYou and I... I don't  think we are on the same page. \nINT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAY \nThe vines ray looked at are growing at a phenomenal rate along the concrete slab under the window. Robots are spraying a red mist out of the back of their ships. Ray holds his hand in the mist that is entering the window.  After a moment.... Ray retracts his hand and turns it over to reveal what appears to be blood. \nHARLAND \nRAY!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! RAY!!!! \nRAY \nKEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN!!! QUIET!!! \nHarland turns around and his whole face is covered in spots of blood. \nThey both turn back around then Harland runs. Ray watches a man being set down, fighting to be let go. A needle like object comes down and stabs the man. It then pumps the blood out of him. Ray has a horrified look on his face. \nHarland goes on saying odd things as Ray gets Rachel prepared for what he has to do. \nRay puts a black cloth over Rachel's eyes which makes her breathing go erratic. \nRACHEL \nWhat are you doing? \nRAY \nWhatever you hear... don't take this off. \nRACHEL \nDad?? \nRAY \nRach? \nRACHEL \nDad? \nRAY \nWhat was that song... that lullaby I didn't know? \nRACHEL \nHushabye Mountains \nRAY \nYeah. Please, Rach, sing it. \nRACHEL \n(begins to sing) ... A gentle breeze.... \nRAY \nDon't stop. \nRACHEL \n... On Hushabye Mountain... \nRAY \nThat's my girl. \nRACHEL \n... For far away my baby goes... \nRay kisses her hands and has her put them over her ears. Then walks back to Harland. He is still digging and chanting \"not my blood\" \nRACHEL \n... it fills the sails ... \nHarland stops and sees Ray standing in the doorway. \nRACHEL \n... of boats that are waiting ... \nRay closes the door behind him as he steps in. \nRACHEL \n... Waiting to sail your worries away \nRachel hears screams and grunts as the two men fight behind the door. \nRACHEL \n... So close your eyes. You're on Hushabye Mountain ... \nRachel's voice begins trembling as she holds her ears tighter. \nRACHEL \n... Wave goodbye to the cares of the day and watch your boat, from Hushabye Mountain, sail far away from Lullaby Bay. \nAll is silent for a while. Ray opens the door and walks out. Rachel releases her hands and takes off the blindfold. Ray is sitting on the stairs. \nRachel sits in his lap and puts his arms around her. They both sit there in silence. \nINT. HARLAND'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK \nShe seems to be frozen. \nRAY \nRachel. \nRACHEL \nDad? \nRay goes to speak just as BOOM! The grate shifts, tossing all the people around and the door opens to take another person up. Ray ducks down with Rachel but this is noticed by the grabbing claw. He is swept up by it. Rachel holds on to his neck to go with him. But then, Ray sees his belt of grenades. He prigs Rachel's hands off of him and grabs the grenades. A soldier sees this and latches onto Ray's arm. \nSOLDIER 2 \nPull me! Pull me!!! \nPeople all start latching on to the soldier and begin heaving him and Ray down. They loose ground until more people join. \nSOLDIER 2 \nWe got him! Keep pulling! Pull me! \nRay is let loose by the clamp and they all fall back into the cage. Ray spits out two grenade pins out of his mouth. This is seen by the soldier. \nSOLDIER 2 \nEVERYBODY DOWN!!! \nHardly anybody gets down as the inside of the robot explodes. We can see the robot exploding on the inside. It breaks doors and fluid stars spilling out of it. The robot releases it's cages and they fall into a tree. Splitting open. People promptly climb out. \nOnce the robot falls to the ground, Rachel looks at Ray in a way that meant how did you do that. \nBoston City Limits - Freeway - Day \nRay walks with Rachel down the road as soldiers are ushering them to \"keep moving.\" The crows are now eating the red plant which appears to be dying rapidly.  Ray picks up a piece, of dead plant. \nRACHEL \nWhat happened to it? \nRay crumples the plant in his hand. It turns to dust and blows away. \nRAY \nIt's dying. \nWatching the dust, they walk along to find a robot lying half struck into a building. \nRAY \nWhat happened? \nSOLDIER 3 \nI don't know, something's happening to them. Please keep moving. \nRay goes up to another soldier for information. \nRAY \nSomething's happening to them? \nSOLDIER 4 \nGo. Go. Just keep moving, sir. \nRay asks another soldier down the road for information. \nRAY \nExcuse me, excuse me, what happened here? You guys take it down? \nSOLDIER 5 \nNo sir, it was behaving erratically, walking in circles then it went down on it's own about an hour ago. (to people) Now let's keep moving, don't stop do not stop! Keep moving! \nRachel and Ray are walking down the road with soldiers and other people. \nRACHEL \nHow is it dead all by it's self? \nRAY \nRachel, I'm not sure. \nSeeing another robot, one soldier motions to get into the water tunnel. Other soldiers make signals to get set up for defense if necessary. Everyone gets into the tunnel. A soldier can be heard telling everyone \"calm down and get in the tunnel\". \nRay notices that birds are flying over AND LANDING ON the robot. The robot's shields are down. As he goes to tell someone, the robot makes the viberating sound. \nRAY \n", "test1_input": "Mary Ann, let me get this. \nMARY ANN \nI can get it. \nRAY \n(rushes to close his bedroom door, as if hiding something) Excuse me. \nRay gets his door closed as Mary Ann goes into Rachel and Robbie's room. \nINT. RAY'S HOUSE - RACHEL AND ROBBIE'S ROOM - DAWN \nMary Ann and Ray go into the room where Robbie is laying on his bed listening to his MP3 player. Rachel sits down on her bed. \nMARY ANN \nA little old to still be sharing aren't they? \nRAY \nI don't hear any complaints. \nMARY ANN \nNo, I do. \nMary Ann walks over to Robbie on his bed and grabs his MP3 player. She un-plugs the headphones and the music stops. Ray sits down on a desk chair. \nMARY ANN \nRobbie's got a paper... (looks at Robbie to make sure he's listening) ...on the French occupation of Algeria due Monday which he's yet to begin. It would be nice if he were done by the time we got back so we don't have to keep him up all night on Sunday. \nMary Ann looks at Robbie who promptly says... \nROBBIE \nI just got to type it up. (makes typing motion) \nMARY ANN \nNo, you just got to start writing it first. \nROBBIE \n(interrupts her) I love you mom! \nMary Ann kisses him. \nMARY ANN \nI love you. (begins walking over to Rachel) Listen to your father. \nMary Ann hugs Rachel and promptly notices... \nMARY ANN \nOh, no shoes on the bed. \nINT Ray's House - Walking Down Stairs - Dawn \nMARY ANN \nWe'll be at my parent's house in Boston but don't call the house line, because you know. Well the point is I've got my cell phone. So if anything comes up, or if you have any questions just call. \nRAY \nBelieve it or not, I can handle it. \nMARY ANN \nI'll leave the phone on. \nRAY \nMary Ann? (beat) It's a good look for you. \nMary Ann opens door and proceeds to walk out the door. She stops to say... \nMARY ANN \nYou think? \nRAY \nYeah. \nMARY ANN \nTake care of our kids. \n", "test1_true": "Mary Ann, you got nothing to worry about. Listen, you tell your mother that Ray sends his love and kisses. \nMARY ANN \n(laughs) She'll love that. \nMary Ann leaves. \nINT Ray's House - Rachel and Robbie's Room - Dawn \nRobbie is watching the TV stories about lighting storms in other parts of the world. Channel changes ever few seconds. Ray turns off the TV and throws Robbie's baseball mitt at him. He catches it and says... \nROBBIE \nBaseball season's over. \nRAY \nFive minutes. It's not going to kill you. \nEXT. RAY'S HOUSE - BACKYARD - DAWN \nRAY \nThere he is. (Robbie puts on his new cap) Boston? (hesitating) That's how it is? (no response from Robbie) That's how it's gonna be? \nRobbie throws ball at Ray unexpectedly who catches it just barely and comments... \nRAY \nCareful with that throw. \nROBBIE \nWhatever Ray! \nRAY \nYour mom says you've got a report due on Monday, so you are going to work on that when you're done here. \nDuring next lines (until noted) they throw the ball back and fourth. \nROBBIE \nYeah, I'm almost finished, I just got to type it up. \nRAY \nYeah, bullshit! \nROBBIE \nYeah, and what do you know Ray? \nRAY \nEverything. Haven't you heard? Between me and my brother, we know everything. \nRACHEL \nWhat's the capital of Australia? \nRAY \nThat's one my brother knows. \nROBBIE \nIs it okay with you if I just laugh the first 500 times you tell that one. \nRAY \nJust do your report. We don't send you to school so you can flunk out. \nROBBIE \nYou don't pay for it, Tim does. \nRay throws the ball at Robbie hard enough to knock dust off his mitt. Robbie shakes his hand in his mitt and grits his teeth in pain. \nRAY \nThat's half of what I've got. \nROBBIE \nYou're an asshole. I hate coming here. \nRAY \n", "test1_id": 1539, "test2_input": "Ray shakes his head no. \nREPORTER \nOh, that's too bad, it would have been a really great story. \nShe closes the door on him. \nBlack blend to: \nINT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DAWN \nRay is talking to Rachel... \nRAY \nLook at me. Look at me. \nRachel and Ray are putting on their coats. \nRAY \nYou keep your eyes only on me, you understand? \nRachel has her big eyes on him as she nods yes. \nRAY \nDon't look down, don't look around me. I'm taking you to the car and you're gonna want to look around. But you are not going to, are you? \nShe shakes her head and whispers \"no\". \nINT. (BUT DUE TO CRASH IT IS NOW EXT.) MARY ANN'S HOUSE - DEBRIS FIELD - DAWN \nRay is carrying Rachel to the van. Robbie is walking along behind them looking at the devastation. \nRAY \nYou're doing good. You're doing good. Keep your eyes on me. We'll go right to Boston, and we're gonna see your mom. \nRACHEL \nI'm not gonna look, dad. \nRAY \nThat's a girl. That's my girl.  Okay, listen, I want you to close your eyes. Got them closed? \nRACHEL \nUm-Huh. \nRAY \nThere you go. Keep em' closed for me. \nCamera follows Robbie who puts his hands on his head in amassment of the devastation. Ray starts the car and turns it around to pull out. \nRAY \nRobbie, get in. \nRobbie does not react at all. Ray becomes agitated. \nRAY \nROBBIE!! GET IN!!! \nRACHEL \nWhy are you yelling? \nRay gives him a mean look as Robbie realizes that they must go. \nRAY \n(to Rachel) It's okay. (to Robbie) Get in! \nThey pull away from the wreckage and continue on their journey. \nEXT. VAN - DAY \nRay is reading the map while Robbie looks out the window. They are taking back roads that have nothing but farmlands on them. \nROBBIE \nWhy the hell aren't we on the turnpike? \nRAY \nBecause I don't want everybody to see we've got a working car. (going over the plan) We'll stay along the Hudson until we find an open bridge or ferry, then we're gonna cross the Hudson. Then take the back roads across Connecticut all the way to Boston. \n", "test2_true": "Where is everybody? \nRAY \nI don't know. Running, hiding, hiding in their basements. \nROBBIE \nIf we had any balls, we'd go back there and find one of those things and kill it. \nRAY \nYeah, well, why don't you just let me make the big decisions, okay? \nRay shoves the map on the floorboard as he becomes more angry at Robbie. \nROBBIE \nWhich would be when? Never Ray? Never's about your speed. \nRACHEL \nOkay, enough Robbie! \nRAY \n(angrily) Okay! Enough with the Ray shit!! It's dad, sir, or if you want Mr. Ferrier. That sounds a little weird to me but you decide. \nRACHEL \nDad?!?! \nRAY \nYes, Rachel. \nRACHEL \nI have to go to the bathroom. \nRAY \nReally? \nRachel shakes her head \"yes\" as he pulls the car over. \nRay grabs Robbie by the shirt arm and holds him in the car. He glares at Rachel mean enough to make her freeze in her seat. \nROBBIE \nCome on. (tugs at his shirt sleeve which Ray has a hold of) I gotta go! \nRAY \nNot so fast, not so fast, all right? Now, there are two things we have to watch out for, and the second is people who might want our car. \nROBBIE \nThere's nobody around! \nRACHEL \nI gotta go. \nRobbie breaks free of Ray's grasp on his sleeve. Robbie and Rachel both get out of the car. Ray follows the both of them to supervise the whole event from the van. \nRAY \n(displeased) Rachel! Rachel, that's good right there. (points to a spot 20' away) \nRACHEL \nI'M NOT GOING IN FRONT OF YOU GUYS! \nRAY \nAll right, then just go where I can see you! \nRACHEL \nARE YOU CRAZY?? DON'T LOOK!! \nRAY \nI'm not gonna look! JUST STAY IN SIGHT!! \nRACHEL \nTHAT'S LOOKING!! \n", "test2_id": 1540, "test3_input": "The three of them fasten their seatbelts. \nROBBIE \nBe careful. \nPeople bang on the windows louder as they shout \"give me a ride\". \nRAY \nI'm sorry, I can't. Please get away from the car. \nA police man jumps on the hood and bangs on the window. \nRAY \nHEY!! \nPOLICE MAN 3 \nStop the car!! \nRAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER \nGET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!! \nPOLICE MAN 3 \nYou could carry 20 people in there! STOP THE CAR!!! \nRachel is panicking and starts to do the \"arms\" process to stay calm. \nRAY AND ROBBIE TOGETHER \nGET OFF THE CAR!!! GET OFF THE CAR!!! \nRay hit's the gas pedal as the police man falls off the side of the van. Ray speeds away now and gains some speed just as someone throws debris into the windshield which breaks it. Rachel screams in panic. \nRACHEL \n(screams) AHHHH!! \nRAY \nOh hold on!! \nRobbie and Ray see a woman standing dead in their way holding a baby. They swerve to miss her. \nROBBIE \nLook out! Look out! \nRAY \n(seeing a telephone pole) Oh, GOD! \nThe van smashes into the telephone pole and the pole lurches about 20 feet. The transformer on the top of the pole begins to arc and spark. The crowd is now rocking the van from side to side shouting at about a riot level. \nINT. VAN - DUSK \nRAY \nAre you okay? \nRachel has no time to respond before the back windshield is busted open by a crowd member. The driver and passenger side windows are then promptly busted. Robbie ducks to avoid the flying glass. A man jumps on the hood and starts ripping glass away from the hole in the front windshield. He is so desperate to get in the van he rips his hands to shreds. A crowd member suggests to \"push it\". He does so and the glass falls through. \nThe passenger side door is opened and Robbie is pulled out by the rioting crowd. \nROBBIE \n(screams) AHHHHH!!!! RAY!!! \nRAY \nROBBIE?!?! ROBBIE?!?!? \nRay then screams to the rioting crowd who are now pulling him out of the driver's side window. \nRAY \nNO, JUST WAIT!!! WAIT!! STOP!!! JUST STOP!!! \nRACHEL \nDADDY!!!! \nA man from the crowd runs up to Rachel's window, breaks it, and tries to grab Rachel. Ray pulls the man out and throws him back into the crowd. \nRAY \nRachel!! (grabs guy) GET OUT OF THERE!!! \n", "test3_true": "RACHEL \nDADDY!!! \nRay wrestles another man trying to grab Rachel. The man gets tossed to the ground. Just as Ray stands up... WHAM!!! Ray is hit in the back of the head by a man with a baseball bat. The blow was not severe enough to cause life threatening damage to Ray. \nRAY \n(grasping his head in pain) AHHH!!! \nAnother man grabs Ray to try to fight him. Women in the crowd yell to \"stop them\" but nobody does so. The man who is strangling Ray yells to \"get in the car\". Robbie fought off the men who pulled him out of the car, comes over to Ray's side, and begins choking the man who is choking Ray. Robbie hit's the man's head against the car. The man releases his grip on Ray, the man and Robbie are drug into the rioting crowd beyond frame view. \nA man gets into the driver's seat and tries to start the car. \nRAY \n(through a choking grip) Rachel, get out of the car! GET OUT OF THE CAR RACHEL!!! \nRay just barely finishes as he is drug off into the crowd beyond frame. \nRACHEL \nDADDY!!! \nRachel tries to get out, but there is an overflow of people barreling into the car through the windows. She is surrounded by people in the car. Robbie and Ray are getting beat in the crowd. \nRay manages to pull out his gun. He fires off two rounds into the air. The crowd instantly moves away from him. One man yells \"take it easy!\" No sign of Robbie. \nRAY \n(pointing the gun at the people on the roof of the car) GET OFF THE CAR!! GET OFF!!! \nMen start getting off the car to avoid the gun threatening Ray. \nRAY \n(continues) GET OFF THE CAR!! Move!! Move!! \nRealizing Robbie is nowhere in sight.... \nRAY \nWhere's my son?!?! \nRIOT MAN 1 \nYou don't need that, Man! \nRAY \nWHERE'S MY SON?!?! ROBBIE!!    .... ROBBIE!! \nRIOT MAN 2 \nPut the gun down, man. It's not me! \nRAY \n(still determined to find Robbie) ROBBIE!!! \nRay is able to pull Robbie out from the crowd. Robbie has a running bloody nose and a badly bruised stomach. He is fighting to catch his breath because he had it knocked out of him. \nRACHEL \nDAD!!! \nThe camera moves from Robbie to Ray, then pivots on his face to reveal a man holding another gun at Ray's head. \nRIOT MAN 3 \nOkay, man, now listen. Put down the gun. I'm taking the car. \nRAY \nMy daughter's in the car... \nRIOT MAN 3 \n(shaking the gun nervously) Put down the gun, I'm taking the car. \nRAY \nAll I want is my daughter.... \nRIOT MAN 3 \nPUT DOWN THE GOD DAMN GUN!!! \nRay is scared into dropping his gun on the street. Ray then puts his hands near his head to avoid being shot. \n", "test3_id": 1541}

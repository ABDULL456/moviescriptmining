Guy's gonna come back... \nRAY \n(interrupts him) I don't have time to expl.... \nMANNY \n(interrupts him) You're busting my chops. I got a shop to run. You know how many people... \nRAY \n(interrupts him) Get in! \nMANNY \nNo, RAY GET OUT OF THE... \nRAY \nGET IN MANNY OR YOU'RE GONNA DIE! \nRachel begins crying as she says... \nRACHEL \nWhat do you mean? \nA dead silent pause falls on everyone. Robbie stares at Ray in fright as Ray and Manny stare at each other. \nMANNY \nAll right, get out of the truck! I'm not kidding now. GET OUT OF THE CAR RAY! \nRachel cries more as a view of an approaching robot shoots flame at a nearby tree. Ray and Manny continue as Rachel looks at the flaming tree. \nMANNY \nI'm not fooling around, I got a busy day ahead of me... \nRAY \n(to Robbie) Close the door! CLOSE IT! \nRay helps Robbie close the door on Manny as they begin speeding away. \nMANNY \nRAY! BRING THE CAR BACK RAY! IT'S NOT MY CAR! \nManny just finishes his line as he is zapped by a disintegrator beam. Camera shows the auto shop zapped by the beam and exploding to smithereens. \nINT. CAR - DUSK \nTrying to outrun the beams... \nRAY \nGET DOWN! GET DOWN! GET DOWN! \nRACHEL \nIs this the terrorists?!?! \nRAY \nJUST GET DOWN. GET DOWN! \nRay grabs Robbie's collar of his jacket and shoves him toward the floor. \nRAY \nGET DOWN! \nROBBIE \nHOLY SHIT! \nHigh shot shows the bridge behind Ray's house being blasted away. The expressway gets hit by the beams and overturns into the houses below. One of them Ray's. An explosion is seen as a fuel tanker falls on Ray's house that obliterates 4 houses. Flaming debris flies all over behind the van. \nThe van has now made it on to the freeway where hundreds of cars are scattered all over the road broken down. The van speeds by them honking the horn every few cars. \nROBBIE \nWhere are we going?!?!?! \nRAY \nWe gotta go! We got to be the only working car around here. I'm not stopping until we are clear. \n", "test1_true": "CLEAR OF WHAT?!?! \nRAY \nWe gotta go. \nROBBIE \nWHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON!?!?!? \nRAY \nYOU SAW! WE'RE UNDER ATTACK!! \nRachel begins frantically crying. After a few seconds, she begins hyperventilating. \nROBBIE \nBY WHO? WHO IS ATTACKING US?!?! \nRAY \nRachel... Rachel you've got to keep it down Rachel! \nAfter honking his horn a few more times, she has only gotten worse. \nRAY \nRachel! SHUT UP RACHEL! I CAN'T THINK! \nROBBIE \n(with a vein driven face) YOU ARE FREAKING HER OUT!! \nRAY \nWELL, LOOK, I'M DRIVING, DO SOMETHING!!! \nRobbie turns to the back seat as an attempt to calm Rachel. He thinks of an old technique he was taught. \nROBBIE \nOkay, (slapping his arms together on top of each other, demonstrating) Put em' up Rache. \nRachel makes his demonstrated arm formation. \nROBBIE \nMake the arms. (he grabs her elbows so she holds the position. He begins to calm her down) This space right here, this is yours. \nRobbie stares directly into her eyes. She takes deep breaths to regain control. She is able to open her eyes and stare back into his eyes to maintain contact. \nROBBIE \n... This belongs to you, right? \nRACHEL \n(panting, but keeping eye contact) Yes... \nROBBIE \n(reassuring her) You're safe in your space. \nRACHEL \n(keeping eye contact) I'm safe in my space. \nROBBIE \n(reassuring her) You're safe in your space. Nothing is going to happen to you in your space. \nRay looks back into the back seat in amazement at Robbie able to do what he's doing. \nRACHEL \nI'm really scared. \nROBBIE \nI'm gonna go to the front seat to talk to dad... \nRACHEL \nNo.... \nROBBIE \n(reassuring her) I will be two feet away. Okay. \n", "test1_id": 1539, "test2_input": "(begins, and continues once in the house) MOM!! TIM!! \nRay remains in the car realizing how unimportant he really is (kids are shouting for Tim). \nINT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - ENTRY - DUSK \nRachel and Robbie are shouting for \"mom\" and \"Tim\" as Ray walks through the door. Rachel and Robbie meet Ray in the entry from different parts of the house in their search. \nROBBIE \nThey're gone. \nRACHEL \nIs she dead?? \nRAY \nShe's not dead. All right? She's just no here. Okay? They're never here. \nROBBIE \nHow do you know? \nRAY \nBecause they are on their way to Boston.... \nThe camera goes to the phone which is briskly picked up by Robbie. Then the camera views into the new family vacation portrait next to the phone. It has Ray missing who is replaced by Tim. \nRAY \n... and so they just kept on going, they're probably up to your grandma's house by now. \nROBBIE \n(dialing the phone) I'm gonna call her. \nRACHEL \nHow come the lights are on here and not at your place? \nRAY \nUmm.... Because nothing bad happened here. Okay? \nRobbie is having no luck and is only getting error tones out of the phone. \nRAY \nSo, were safe here. All Right? \nRemembering Robbie's calming \"arm\" technique... \nRAY \nOkay, Rachel? This is your area. Okay, you are safe in your area... \nRACHEL \nDad. That's not how it goes. \nRAY \nOkay, well, you hungry, huh? I'll get you some food. I'm gonna feed you. Get something to eat.  (digs into the box) What do we have here?? \nROBBIE \n.. Busy signals, one of the fast ones.... You think all the circuits are down? \nRAY \n(continues) Ketchup, Mustard, Ahh, Tabasco, Barbeque Sauce. This is really good Robbie. Vinaigrette. I said pack food. What... What the hell is this? \nROBBIE \nThat's all that was in your kitchen. \nRAY \nOkay. No, it's all right, it's all right. \nRobbie takes his hat off and sits down as Ray searches the box for food. He finds peanut butter. \nRAY \nUh, food... Uh, bread... (getting the bread) okay, we're gonna have... umm.... We'll just get some sandwiches. \nRay takes the twist tie off the bread bag and dumps the whole loaf on the counter. He taps his hands together to try to calm Rachel and Robbie. \nRAY \n", "test2_true": "Ray opens the peanut butter and grabs a wooden spoon from the cooking utensil holder on the counter. \nRAY \nMaybe after we get done eating, I will take you down, teach you how to play some poker. A little five card stud... a little blackjack... \nRACHEL \nI'm allergic to peanut butter. \nRAY \n(laughs) Since when? \nRACHEL \n(with a snotty look) Birth! \nRobbie shakes his head yes to her statement. \nRAY \nOkay, well, umm, here (hands her two pieces of bread) You can eat the bread. Okay? \nRACHEL \nI'm not hungry. \nRAY \nOkay, well. Robbie and I are going to be eating peanut butter sandwiches. (to Robbie) You want jelly on this sandwich? \nROBBIE \nI'm not hungry either. \nRAY \nYou're not hungry either? Well, that's fine. \nRay picks up the bread pieces and throws them at the sink window. One with peanut butter sticks on the window and slowly slides off. \nRAY \nEverybody just relax, okay? Because we are here now and we're safe, and we're gonna stay.  And in the morning your mom and Tim are going to be here and everything's gonna be fine. Okay? (no responses) Okay. \nINT. MARY ANN'S HOUSE - BASEMENT - DUSK \nRachel and Ray are running down the stars carrying their own pillows and blankets. Robbie follows slightly behind them carrying his own and a few extra pillows and blankets. \nRACHEL \nIf everything's fine, why do we have to sleep in the basement. We've got perfectly good beds. \nRAY \nIt's like a slumber party. \nROBBIE \nWhat are you afraid is gonna happen to us? \nRAY \n(walks over to the weight room corner of the basement) Nice basement. \nRACHEL \nI want to sleep in my bed. I've got back problems. \nRAY \nOkay. You know on the Weather Channel when there's a tornado, and they tell you to go to the basement for safety? It's like that. \nRACHEL \nThere's gonna be tornadoes? \nRAY \nRachel, no more talking. \nRobbie puts his hat on Rachel's head and ushers her over to the spot under the stairs where blankets are laid out. Ray walks over to the chair about five feet away from the bed. \nRACHEL \nCould you be a little nicer to me. God! \nRachel and Robbie are heard in the background... \n", "test2_id": 1540, "test3_input": "RAY \nThere's room on the boat!!! \nSHERYL \nLET US THROUGH GOD DAMN IT!!! \nRAY \nTHERE'S STILL ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! THERE'S ROOM ON THE BOAT!!! \nRachel screams as Ray runs to the bow with Rachel in his arms. Robbie is soon to follow... \nRACHEL \nROBBIE?!?! \nRAY \nStay with me! Stay with me Robbie!!! \nRobbie runs right past them and up to the captain's deck. \nRAY \nROBBIE!!! \nRobbie, panting hard, looks at the inclining ramp and sees there are still people hanging on to the back side of the ramp. He starts running to the stern of the ship. \nThe captain pushes the throttle all the way full. The propellers start so fast they spray water all over the people still at the dock. Pulling away at it's ties to the dock, the ship begins pulling away. \nRACHEL \n(seeing Robbie running to the stern) Robbie? Robbie!?!?! \nRAY \nRobbie!!! \nRACHEL \nROBBIE!!! \nRobbie ignores them as he jumps onto the grate of the folded up ramp. Climbing to the top, he begins helping those who are hanging on the back side of the ramp. \nROBBIE \nHere, grab my hand!! Hold on! I got you! HOLD ON!!! \nCamera turns or Ray's face. Ray looks at Robbie helping people in admiration and proud ness. \nROBBIE \nTAKE MY HAND!! TAKE IT!!! \nINT. CAPTAIN'S CONTROL ROOM - DUSK \nThe captain sees some sort of whirlpool sucking water down into a hole. The ship begins to slowly turn toward the hole, being sucked in. \nCAPTAIN \nOh, my god! \nPassengers rush over to the starboard railing where a robot emerges from the whirlpool. WOOSH!!! Hundreds of gallons of water are tossed up with the robot. The water in the air turns to snow as it falls on the ship. The robot's engines howl in the air. \nRAY \n(fearing danger to his son) ROBBIE!!! \nThe robot's claws begin pushing the ship making it lean to one side and finally tip over on it's side. Robbie is already running towards Ray. At the turn of the ship, the three go into the water. Cars start coming towards them. WOOSH!!! A car comes right for them. SPLASH!!! The car hit's the water where they are, instantly pinning Robbie and Ray to the front of it. Rachel is holding on to Robbie's back, also going down. \nThe people in the car are screaming as the car fills with water. \nAs the ship completely capsizes, people are thrown or washed into the water. Cars sink down, people float and the ship bobs in the water. Ray is able to un-pin himself and pulls Robbie out. They all begin swimming to the surface. Rachel lags behind and Robbie grabs her and helps her up.  At the surface, they meet. A ship propeller at full power. They begin to swim away from it. Claws from the ship over head are grabbing people and pulling them into the robot's holds. \nEXT. BEACH - DARK \nRay is heaving Rachel up to shore. Robbie is not far behind. They are all fighting to get their breath after swimming for so long. Ray can no longer haul Rachel up the beach. \nRAY \nHelp me. Help me with her. \nROBBIE \n(gagging) Okay. \nRobbie almost slips as he gags, still fighting for breath. \nPulling each other up the hill.... \n", "test3_true": "Don't stop. Don't stop. \nAlert sirens can be heard coming from the city. \nRay pulls the two of them. \nROBBIE \n(yells in pain) AHHH. \nThey all lay on the hillside, gasping for air. In the distance they look... Two robots are still picking people up out of the water. Two more robots have joined and are picking up people off the streets. Many people scream. \nWith jaws clattering, Rachel looks toward the other hillside on the other side of the river. Shivering Ray and Robbie look there with her. \nTHREE MORE robots are on the opposite hillside blasting people with their disintegrator beams. Many more people scream. Rachel, in fright, runs towards the bushes behind Ray. Ray sees her, and runs with her. Robbie runs with them. They stop and squat down as they see the top of another robot coming over the hill to join the three. \nRobbie, running, with clenched teeth, stops. His jaw drops as we are able to see hundreds of thousands of articles of clothing falling from the sky. They continue running through the woods where clothes fall like snow. \nPasture Fence Line - Dark \nRobbie is walking 5' ahead of Ray and Rachel along a fence line of a pasture. Gunfire is seen and heard over the hill about 500 yards away. Robbie, who always wanted to help in the fight, begins walking faster toward the gunfire. \nRACHEL \nRobbie, slow down. \nRobbie follows the fence line and walks a little faster. \nRACHEL \nRobbie, slow down!!! \nRobbie, who is coming closer to the hill, sees army trucks rolling down the road and up the hill. Seeing this, Robbie walks into a slow run along the fence line. Ray and Rachel try to keep up. \nRACHEL \nRobbie. \nRAY \nRobbie. We got to stay together Robbie. \nRobbie, getting closer, runs faster, faster. \nRAY \nRobbie! Stay together! ROBBIE!!! \nRay and Rachel duck as a missile comes EXTREMELY CLOSE to their heads. Jets speed by them overhead. Rachel screams. \nRAY \nGET BACK HERE!!! \nRobbie, in a full scale run, runs with the army trucks that have now taken to the hills. Ray and Rachel run as fast as they can to try to stay with Robbie. \nRACHEL \nRobbie!! NO!! ROBBIE!!! COME BACK!!! \nRobbie runs with the trucks with all his might. Ray and Rachel are now searching for him. \nRAY \nROBBIE!!! (sets Rachel down next to a tree) NOW DON'T MOVE! FOR GOD'S SAKE, STAY RIGHT HERE! I'M COMING RIGHT BACK! (calling out for him) ROBBIE!!! \nRay sees Robbie about 20' ahead of him. \nRAY \nROBBIE!!! ROBBIE!!! \nRobbie is held back by two soldiers. Robbie gets thrown back by them where Ray grabs him and pins him to the ground. Robbie fights to get back up. \nRAY \nWHY ARE YOU DOING THIS??? \nSoldiers are blasting everything they have to something over the hill. Radio people are telling their officers \"no effect on target\". \nRobbie is watching all he is able to see while Ray tries to get his attention on him. \nRAY \nLISTEN TO ME! TURN AROUND! I WANT YOU TO LISTEN TO ME! \nRobbie ignores him and continues watching artillery blast over the hill. \nRay gets fed up with Robbie. He grabs his shoulders and flips him over on to his back. Robbie looks at Ray in fright that he did that. Ray grabs his coat shoulders, and climbs on top of him, pining him down to the ground. \n", "test3_id": 1541}

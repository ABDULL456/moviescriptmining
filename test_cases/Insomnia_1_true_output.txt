The partners, lock eyes.  Years of working together.  A thousand things unsaid.  Hap reaches for the door. 
HAP (cont'd) They're watching us, Will.  Like it or not.  They're watching us. 
INT. WILL'S ROOM - NIGHT 
Will's asleep.  Kay Connell's folder open on his chest.  It's dark in his room, quiet.  Suddenly the shade on his window quivers and SNAPS up, flooding the room with light. 
Will's eyes pop open.  He rolls over to look at the clock: 3:15.  Squinting, he gets up and walks over to the window. We can see the rest of his scar.  Runs down deep across his sternum. 
He yanks the shade back down.  It bucks, then settles. Satisfied, Will returns to bed.  Plumps the pillow, pulls the blanket up around him.  Closes his eyes. 
The shade lurches halfway.  Then SNAPS back up.  Light pours in.  Will's eyes open. 
WILL You got to be kidding me. 
EXT. STREET - NIGHTMUTE - DAY 
Will jogs along in a Sonics sweatshirt, a ring of sweat around his collar.  He looks out over the harbor.  Fishing boats coming in with their early morning haul.  More halibut. He checks his watch.  Slows to a walk.  Looks up and sees... 
Ellie Burr standing on the front steps of the Pioneer Lodge. Smiles.  Holds up some car keys. 
ELLIE Fred wants us to meet him at the Connell's. 
INT./EXT. JEEP CHEROKEE - DAY 
Ellie driving.  A hula-girl, swinging from the rear-view mirror.  Will in the passenger seat.  Wearing a crisp suit. Ellie hands him a take-out bag. 
ELLIE Brought you a bear claw.  Just in case you were hungry. 
Will takes the bag.  Looks inside.  Yikes. 
ELLIE (cont'd) Local delicacy. 
WILL Think I'll pass. 
He puts the bag on the dash.  Looks out the window. Nightmute's main street.  A line of shops.  Undistinguished Town Hall.  Elementary school up on a hill.  Sign out front: Sign-ups for Midnight Little League! 
WILL (cont'd) What kind of calls you get around here? 
ELLIE Oh.  You know.  Small-time stuff. Nothing like what you must get.  Mostly drinking-related problems.  Domestic abuse.  Barroom fights.  Stuff like that. 
She shifts down.  Takes a steep turn. 
ELLIE (cont'd) In the summer months it's pretty quiet. That's when there's work out on the boats.  The rest of the year, though... 
They pass a MAN walking along the road.  Gnarled walking stick.  Ellie calls out the window. 
ELLIE (cont'd) Hey, there, Joe! 
JOE waves.  They pass. 
ELLIE (cont'd) That's Joe Willy.  Took his family hostage in November.  That was the most exciting thing that happened last year. I wasn't there, though. (grinds gear) Chief barely lets me handle anything above a misdemeanor. 
Will looks over at her.  Smiles. 
WILL Don't give misdemeanors a bad rap. 
ELLIE But they're so boring.  All small stuff. 
WILL It's all about the small stuff.  Small lies.  Small mistakes.  Small oversights. People give themselves away in a traffic violation just as much as they do in a murder case.  It's human nature. 
He looks over.  Ellie's listening intently. 
WILL (cont'd) Aren't you going to write that down? 
Ellie, searching her pockets for something to write with... 
ELLIE Let me just... 
Stops.  Looks over.  Realises Will's teasing her. 
EXT. CONNELL HOUSE - DAY 
A small ranch house.  Aluminum siding.  FLOWERS piled up by the front door.  TEDDY BEARS.  RIBBONS.  Left by well-wishers. 
MRS. CONNELL (O.S.) I haven't tidied up, since Fred told me not to touch anything. 
INT. HALLWAY - CONNELL HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
MRS. CONNELL, a big woman with a thick grey braid down her back, opens the door to her daughter's room.  Looks at Will. 
MRS. CONNELL I don't believe in keeping a child's room like a shrine. 
Will heads into the room.  Hap follows.  A palpable uneasiness between them.  Fred and Ellie stand in the doorway.  Mrs. Connell turns to go. 
INT. KAY CONNELL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
A small bedroom.  Pink shag carpeting and clouds painted on the ceiling.  Pictures cut from magazines pasted on the walls.  A stack of tapes and a boom box in the corner. 
Will stands in the middle of the room.  Taking it in. 
WILL Typical seventeen year-old. (beat) She went to a party Friday night? 
ELLIE Down at a local dive the kids like to hang out in. 
Fred throws Ellie a look.  "Kids?"  She's practically a kid herself.  Will opens the top drawer of the bureau.  Roots beneath the panties. 
WILL No diary. 
On top of the bureau, a stack of photos.  A couple torn up. Kay Connell and a GIRL with white-blonde hair.  Laughing. 
FRED She left the party early.  Friends said she had a fight with her boyfriend and stormed out.

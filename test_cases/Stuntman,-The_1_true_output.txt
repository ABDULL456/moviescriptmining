Chuck turns on him enraged, overreacting. 
CHUCK And Burt's specialty was drowning. You know one goddamn daredevil on this picture was enough! What the hell was Eli thinking, giving me a smart-ass, cocky, amateur kid when I need a stunt man! It's a little different running across that roof when they're pumping tracer bullets over your head. 
CAMERON (eloquently pleading his case) I was running for twenty-six months with guys shooting at me...not over my head...at my head and I'm alive. I knew daredevils. I got nothing against them...it's just they're all dead. So ease off and give me a chance... 
Cameron is surprised to see that Chuck is grinning. 
CAMERON (CONT'D) (genuinely) Hey, were you putting me on? 
CHUCK Me?   I wouldn't know how to do that. 
Chuck starts to walk away, then stops and looks at Cameron. 64   EXT.   ROOFTOP MUNICIPAL BUILDING - CLOSE ON CHUCK - MINUTES LATER 
CHUCK (pained) Can you imaging Eli doing a World War I picture without horses? Do you know the gags I could do with four runaway horses pulling a caisson? 
Cameron sailing into the SHOT. Chuck ducks slightly, catching Cameron on his back and flipping him into a somersault. Cameron lands on the sharply slanted slate roof of the municipal building. Chuck stands beside him straddling the peak. The church steeple can be seen in b.g. (and we now realize time has passed and we are no longer in the graveyard of the previous sequence, but atop the building). 
CHUCK (CONT'D) ...Next time hit me higher. 
CAMERON (climbing to his feet) What's Eli got against horses?    I love horses. 
CHUCK Don't butter me up. 
Cameron goes running at Chuck and once again flies over his shoulder. Sprawling on the slippery slate, he looks up to see Chuck strolling down the hazardous incline like a mountain goat. Cameron scrambles to follow. 
CHUCK (as he walks) We'll draw a sight line for you to follow down the roof here, while you're rolling. Now there's nothing very difficult. But this is where you gotta think. Your mind can't be on snatch. It's gotta be on grabbing that gutter. 
They have reached the lower edge of the roof.    Cameron looks down at the drop. 
CAMERON Or my brains are all over the pavement again, right? 
CHUCK (walking away) You know a good falling horse makes more money in four minutes than a bank president does in a year? 
CAMERON Picture's not over. Maybe you'll still get your chance. 
Chuck has stopped and they peer down through a skylight to where the crew is setting up a shot in a room below. 
CHUCK (sadly) Naw, all they care about is story. 64A 
They move to another edge of the roof overlooking a NARROW CENTRAL COURTYARD. They gaze down at a WINDOW AWNING two stories below that juts from the side of the building-wing across the court. 
CHUCK (CONT'D) Now here's where the scuffle ends. When the pipe breaks loose, you fall and hit that awning. Then Eli yells "cut" and old Raymond takes your place for the close-ups and the glory. That's where the German soldiers catch him and throw him in the nuthouse. They're shootin' that scene downstairs now. 
CAMERON (staring at awning) That's supposed to hold me? Probably doesn't hold rain. 
CHUCK It's not a real awning, it's a catcher. 
65   EXT.   MUNICIPAL BUILDING ROOF - CLOSE ON CAMERON - DAY 
Cameron's face is beginning to sweat and the veins are bulging from the growing strain of some physical effort. 
CHUCK'S VOICE It's no harder up here than it is on the ground... 
CAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal Cameron dangling from a section of rain gutter, four stories above the ground. 
CHUCK'S VOICE (CONT'D) It's the same gag...it's just a little scarier. And that's what you get paid for. 
CAMERON (alert) Yeah, how much? 
CHUCK You're stealing candy with this gag. You get six hundred bucks. 
CAMERON (almost falling) 
Jesus!... 
CHUCK ...Christ! Watch it, will ya? (helping Cameron onto roof) What did you think a stunt man is? He's a professional. If the camera jams, that's another six hundred and if Eli says "try it again," six hundred more. 
CAMERON (exultantly) Yahooo! Six-fucking-hundred-bucks!! 
66   INT.   MUNICIPAL BUILDING - ASYLUM SET 
In a large vacant hall on the ground floor of the municipal building, a movie set has been erected representing the ward room in a World War I military asylum. In it, Eli's crew is filming a sequence -- a dozen enraged INMATES in tatters, heads shaven, wild- eyed, advance toward Raymond, shrieking (as though in echo of Cameron's exultant yell). 
67   CLOSER ANGLE 
Raymond, dressed as a British Flyer, his face bloodied, crouches and retreats in terror, a man caught in a nightmare, as these mutilated derelicts suddenly swarm over him. One, like a mad dog, goes fro his throat, another wields his own artificial limb as a club. Raymond (in character) breaks free and screams. 
RAYMOND ...STOP!...Get away!!

EMMA (to Innes) Please ignore him. After two glasses of claret he tends to becomes mischievous. 
DARWIN No I'm serious. If thousands are destroyed that a few may live their lives, is not the general sum total of happiness not in some kind of massive deficit? 
INNES Well far be it from me to speculate on the mind of God, far less the happiness of an earthworm ha ha ha. But it seems to me that nature is at peace...and most of her denizens are content. 
EMMA Amen. 
INNES (to Darwin) You don't agree. 
DARWIN I think it is a battlefield. A constant and shifting struggle for survival between everything and everything else. 
EMMA I really do think men have a problem with natural beauty. They cannot ever just accept it for what it is. (Calls off) Children! Sandwiches! (Then) Tell me of your wife Mr Innes. 
Darwin lies back on the rug and turns his head away from the sun. 
The base of a tangled hedgerow is just a few feet away. 
Looking into its tangled depths he sees something gleaming white - the skull of a sheep with briars growing through the eye sockets. 
24   EXT. BASE OF THE HEDGEROW. TIME-LAPSE. NIGHT                  24 
The sheep's skull is half-decomposed. 
In fast forward we see maggots pecking the remnants of flesh from the bone, birds feeding on the maggots. 
A bird becomes trapped among the briars. It flaps madly upsetting a nest. 
Eggs and blind featherless hatchlings fall down through the dark web of branches where they are devoured by voles and rats, then slugs, then worms 
All the times tendrils and vines are growing, the skull - bleached white - now encased in a cage of thick spiny branches, fizzing with insect life, where ants and ground beetles feast on the carcasses of slugs and.... 
25   INT. DARWIN'S BEDROOM. THE PRESENT. DAWN                      25 
Darwin wakes in sudden terror. 
Dawn light illuminates the wallpaper in front of him - a William Morris design of interweaving vines. 
Emma, is asleep in her night-cap at his side. 
Darwin lies for a while in the semi darkness, until his hand, fluttering on the coverlet, becomes still at last. 
26   INT. SCULLERY. THE PAST. DAY.                                 26 
Light and noise. 
Crash of gleaming copperware, clattering of water in the pipes as the servants prepare Sunday breakfast 
The cook, Mrs Davies looks out through a steamed up window to see the angular figure of Charles Darwin, bent almost double inspecting a tiny segment of lawn. 
Brodie joins Mrs Davies at the window. 
MRS DAVIES What is he doing now, exactly? 
BRODIE Cutting the grass with nail scissors. 
MRS DAVIES Such a shame he never had a proper job. At least your Mr Thackeray had his books to write. 
27   INT. DOWN HOUSE. THE PAST. DAY                                27 
Children thunder up and down the stairs between Brodie who is doing a final check on grooming and Emma who is marshalling them in the hall. 
28   INT. HALLWAY. THE PAST. DAY                                   28 
EMMA Chop chop Georgie. Socks! And you have not buttoned your trousers. 
Baby Lenny starts crying and she goes to comfort him 
29   INT. GIRLS' BEDROOM. THE PAST. DAY.                           29

ANNIE Did you never think of getting married Miss Brodie.

PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) -- his life? 
DORKY DAVID 
(scared) I don't know. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
Well, I recommend knowing before speaking.. The law leaves much room for interpretation -- but very little for self-doubt. 
As she turns away -- 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) And you were right. It was Aristotle. 
The class half-laughs in relief. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) I assume you've all read pages 1- 48 and are now well-versed in subject matter jurisdiction. Elle looks around, surprised, as students open their books. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Who can tell us about Gordon v. Steele? 
Silence.   Stromwell looks down at the seating chart. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Ivan Greenstein? 
Intense Ivan straightens in his' seat. 
IVAN 
Gordon sued her doctors for malpractice. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
And what did the dispute entail? (looking at her chart) Let's call on someone in the hot zone. Elle Woods? Elle looks up, distressed. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE 
Uh... I wasn't aware that we had an assignment. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
(looking at her chart) Sarah Knottingham? 
SARAH KNOTTINGHAM -- a prim and preppy blue-blood brunette, dressed in pearls and a sweater set -- looks up. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL (CONT'D) 
(continuing) Do you think it's acceptable that Ms. Woods is unprepared? Sarah looks over at Elle. Elle gives her a mortified smile. Sarah turns back to Professor Stromwell. 
SARAH 
No, I don't. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
Would you support my decision to ask her to leave and return to class only when she is prepared? 
SARAH 
Absolutely. Elle can't believe that this girl would betray her. Having no choice,, she gathers her purse and goes, completely humiliated. Professor Stromwell returns to the matter at hand. 
PROFESSOR STROMWELL 
Now, Ms. Knottingham, did diversity jurisdiction'exist in this case? 
42   EXT. LAW SCHOOL QUAD - BENCHES - DAY - LATER                        42 
EMMETT -- a shy and quirkily handsome 28-year-old who could pass for younger -- sits on a bench, going over some papers. He looks up and spots Elle -- sitting across from him -- looking traumatized. 
EMMETT 
Are you okay? Elle looks up, snapping out of her stupor. 
(CONTINUED) 
ELLE 
Do they just -- put you on the spot like that? Like, all the time? 
EMMETT 
The professors? Yeah, they tend- to do that. Socratic method. 
ELLE 
And if you don't know the answer, they just kick you out? He smiles. 
EMMETT 
You have Stromwell. 
ELLE 
(hopeful) Did she do that to you, too? 
EMMETT 
No, but she made me cry once. Not in class -- I waited until I got to my room, but yeah, she can pretty much shrivel your balls -- or you know, your whatevers . 
ELLE 
(stricken) Neat .             Â·    '   ,   ' 
EMMETT 
Don't worry. It gets better. Who else do you have? Elle looks at her schedule. 
ELLE 
Donovan, Royalton and Levinson. 
EMMETT 
Speak up in Donovan's class. He likes people with an opinion. Sit in the back for Royalton. He tends to spit when he talks about products liability. Elle makes a face.      He smiles.   Liking her. 
(CONTINUED) 
EMMETT (CONT'D) 
(continuing) And make sure you read the footnotes in Levinson's class. That's where all her exam questions come from.

Terry intercepts him on his way out of the room. 
TERRY She was running behind his chair when he got up. It was an accident. (he's uncertain) A complete... total... accident. 
Stevens looks at Carmen who giggles. He's humiliated by his own temper, attempts to calm himself. Terry puts a sympathetic hand on his shoulder. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. LOS ANGELES - AERIAL SHOT - DAY 
The immense sprawl, the arterial flow of the freeways, the blinding light. We DESCEND... 
INT. TRAIN STATION - UNDERGROUND - DAY OR NIGHT 
People getting off, among them the former Joe Stevens, now known as JOHN HULL. He's carrying a suitcase. 
INT. TRAIN STATION/EXT. STREET - DAY 
Hull goes up the stairs onto a downtown street. 
EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY 
South L.A. neighborhood. A 13-year-old BLACK YOUTH selling drugs through a car window. Hull walks by. He's at ease, looking around, his manner subtly announcing that he belongs here, just as in the train station he seemed to belong among the commuters. 
EXT. TRANSIENT MOTEL - COURTYARD - DAY 
A fat BLONDE WOMAN (61, large white glasses, tiny shoes) leads Hull down a corridor. 
BLONDE WOMAN Television mostly. I was on "Sky King" twice, "Ramar of the Jungle." That was a silly show. The jungle was mostly flats... 
They pass an open door where a 6-year-old boy, JAMES, a latchkey, sits on the stoop playing Gameboy; inside, his mother, BELINDA, a broken down whore, is doing her nails and drinking Pepsi. She looks up, bats her lashes at Hull. 
BLONDE WOMAN (continuing) You want my advice, I'd stay away from that bitch. 
She opens the door to the room across the hall. A dump. Hull walks in, drops his duffle: he'll take it. The Blonde lounges in the doorway. He closes the door. 
INT. ROOM - DAY 
Hull empties his pockets on the dresser. Looks at his money, room key, identification. Looks at himself in the mirror. He touches his clothes, his face, tries on different expressions. 
(NOTE: Throughout the film, Hull continually checks himself out in mirrors, both to adjust his appearance to the circumstances and as if in an attempt to recall who he "really" is.) 
EXT. 79TH AND FIGUEROA - TWILIGHT 
On the seam between South-Central and USC. Lots of people out: children, students, dealers, whores. Hull with a new haircut. 
EXT. ANOTHER, SIMILAR CORNER - DAY 
Dealers (most in mid-teens) meeting cars, making transactions. All this casually observed. EDDIE comes up the street, reciting his version of an old street toast. 
EDDIE On the day of the King's castration, all the counts and no accounts were down on the deck with Georgia Tech taking turns in the back seat... 
Those dealers not at car windows, gather around. He never speaks to them, goes on declaiming as he exchanges drugs for money. 
Hull watches, talking to another street person. His appearance continues to change: clothes, posture, walk, gestures subtly conform to the environment, a bit like Zelig. Throughout the film his appearance shifts, depending on who he's with. We always recognize him, but each time he's different. 
He walks up to a dealer, makes a quick buy and keeps going. But he sees them and is seen. 
INT. AN OFFICE - NIGHT 
Hull drops eleven foil balls on a green blotter. Carver counts out money for him. 
INT. HULL'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY 
He sits at the window, eating a burrito, watching little James play in the courtyard. 
EXT. STREET - EVENING 
Hull approaches another Dealer, the 13-year-old seen earlier (angelic face). Like Hull, he's trying to act tough. 
HULL Whatta you got? 
13-YEAR-OLD DEALER (voice just changing) Nickel rock, dime rock. Excellent shit. 
Hull exchanges a folded twenty for two foil balls. He walks off. He has gone twenty feet when...

ANNETTE Gee, with an invitation like that how could a girl refuse. 
SEBASTIAN Please. 
ANNETTE Give me a minute. I'll be right down. 
SEBASTIAN Thank you. 
She re-enters the guest room. Sebastian's cell phone RINGS. He answers it. 
INTERCUT WITH: 
25   INT. VALMONT TOWNHOUSE - KATHRYN'S BEDROOM - NIGHT         25 
Kathryn sits in her bathrobe. One foot soaks in a small tub of water while Sook-Hee tends to her other foot. 
KATHRYN Fuck her yet? 
SEBASTIAN I'm working on it. 
KATHRYN Loser. 
SEBASTIAN Blow me. 
KATHRYN Call me later. 
SEBASTIAN Okay. 
She hangs up and lights a cigarette. Sook-Hee accidently jabs her toe. 
KATHRYN Ow. That hurt you stupid bitch. 
SOOK-HEE Sorry. 
Kathryn kicks some water in her face. 
KATHRYN Oops. 
26   EXT. ESTATE - SWIMMING POOL - NIGHT                        26 
Annette comes down, wearing a bathrobe. She sits by the pool as Sebastian treads water away from her. 
ANNETTE (holding out the letter) You know it amazes me that someone as bright as you can be so horrible. 
SEBASTIAN What? Another letter from your friend? 
ANNETTE This is my favorite part. (reading the letter) Even more treacherous and dangerous than he is charming and fascinating. He has never taken a single step or spoken a single word without some dishonorable or criminal intention. Every young girl he has successfully pursued has regretted it. 
SEBASTIAN You know you could at least have the decency of telling me who's badmouthing me so I might have the opportunity to confront them face to face. How do you know it's not some girl who's pissed off at me for breaking up with her? 
ANNETTE I sincerely doubt it. 
SEBASTIAN Give me the fucking letter. 
Annette smiles and tears the letter up. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) Why did you do that? 
ANNETTE The last thing I need is you going into my room searching for this while I'm away. 
SEBASTIAN (mocking) Is that the last thing you need? My your clever. 
She takes pieces of paper and sticks it in her bathrobe. She then stands and takes off the robe, revealing a one piece bathing suit underneath. 
ANNETTE How's the water? 
SEBASTIAN Refreshing. 
She dives in the pool and surfaces. 
SEBASTIAN (cont'd) You're right you know. 
ANNETTE About what? 
SEBASTIAN About what you said today in the stable. I'm not a happy person. 
ANNETTE I never said that. 
SEBASTIAN You implied it. 
ANNETTE Look, I didn't mean to give you a hard time.

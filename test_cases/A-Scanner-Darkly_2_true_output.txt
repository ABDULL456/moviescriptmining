DONNA HAWTHORNE Someday I'm gonna get married and I'm going to need all this stuff. When you get married, you need everything there is. 
Donna slips out of her leather jacket, tosses it on a pile of jackets, and pads into the kitchen. Arctor follows her, tiptoeing along the paper. 
BOB ARCTOR How much of what you've got did you buy and how much did you steal? 
INT. DONNA'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Buy?   What do you mean "buy"? 
Donna opens a cabinet, reaches in back, pulls out several plastic bags of pills. She lays them on the counter, opens a drawer, pulls out a pipe and some hash, sits at the table and fills the pipe. Arctor lays money on the table. 
BOB ARCTOR Like when you buy dope. Like a dope deal. When I mean by "buy" is an extension into the greater world of business transactions of what we have present now, with us, as dope deals. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DONNA HAWTHORNE I think I see what you're saying. 
BOB ARCTOR Like when you rip off those Coca-Cola truck you tailgate. That's stealing. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE No.     It's a form of barter. 
BOB ARCTOR Donna, look, you're gonna get caught, and if you got drugs in your car when they catch you, there's nothing I can do to protect you then. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE You protect me? What are you talking about? 
BOB ARCTOR Nothing.     I just... Please take care. 
Donna lights the pipe. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE The Coca-Cola company is a capitalist monopoly. No one else can make it but them. That's fucking wrong. (beat) C'mere, I'll supercharge you. 
Arctor sits down at the table. 
BOB ARCTOR Okay, cool. 
Donna walks over to him, puffing the hash pipe to keep it alive. She bends over him and Arctor opens his mouth. She exhales long and forcefully into his mouth. This is as close as these two get to sex. Arctor's eyes go soft as he looks up at Donna. 
BOB ARCTOR (CONT'D) I love you, Donna. 
Donna looks down at him. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Yeah, I can dig it, you being in love with me. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Donna grins, sits down and takes a hit from the pipe. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. DONNA'S LIVING ROOM - A BIT LATER 
Donna and Arctor are stoned on the couch in the dim room. 
BOB ARCTOR Hey, Donna, man, do you like cats? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Dripping little things. Moving along about a foot above the ground. 
BOB ARCTOR No.   On the ground. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Drippy.    Behind furniture. 
BOB ARCTOR Little spring flowers, then? 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Yes. Little spring flowers. With yellow in them. That first come up. 
BOB ARCTOR Before.    Before anyone. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Yes. Before anyone stomps on them and they're gone. 
Arctor's eyes get wet. 
BOB ARCTOR Yeah. You know me exactly, Donna. You can read me. No one knows me but you. 
Donna draws on the pipe, but it's out. 
DONNA HAWTHORNE No more. 
Her smile disappears. 
BOB ARCTOR What's wrong? 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
DONNA HAWTHORNE Nothing. 
BOB ARCTOR Donna, can I put my arm around you.   I want to hold you, okay? 
Donna's stoned eyes suddenly widen.

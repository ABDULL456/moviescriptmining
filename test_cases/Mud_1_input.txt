1 INT. ELLIS' ROOM - PREDAWN 1 
ELLIS(14) sits fully-clothed on top of his made bed. He is a wiry young man with a few blonde hairs on his upper lip struggling desperately to be a mustache. His room, cluttered with junk, is dark, quiet and tiny. A backpack and an oversized Walkie-Talkie sit next to him. The silence is cut by a SQUAWK from the Walkie. Ellis quickly grabs it. 
ELLIS I'm comin' out now. 
He crams the Walkie into his backpack and slings it over his shoulder. On his feet, he slides open a window at the foot of his bed. He's out in one motion. 
2 EXT. HOUSEBOAT - PREDAWN 2 
Ellis skirts alongside the exterior wall of his room on a two- foot-wide section of decking. He lives on a HOUSEBOAT anchored just off the bank of the Arkansas River. The "boat" is really the combination of a double wide trailer and a vinyl-sided shack fused together atop large flotilla. Ellis scurries to the mobile home section of the boat. He slips past a barbecue grill and settles underneath a lighted window. VOICES come from inside. Slowly, Ellis gets on his toes to peer through the window. 
3 INT. ELLIS' KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 3 
MARY LEE(41) takes a jug of milk out of the refrigerator. SENIOR(52) sits at a small table reading a newspaper. The mobile home kitchenette is no larger than Ellis' room. 
MARY LEE I just want to have a conversation. I just want to talk about it. 
Mary Lee sits down across from Senior, who doesn't look up from his paper. Her eyes narrow and she extends a finger toward him. 
MARY LEE (CONT'D) If you don't look up from that goddamn paper... 
She stops before completing the thought. After a moment, Senior lowers his paper. He stares across the table at his wife. He looks at her with true disdain. 
His eyes trace down her face and robe before finally settling on his cup of coffee. He picks up the cup, takes a sip, and sets it back on the table. He raises the paper up. Mary Lee's eyes soften. She bites the inside of her cheek to keep from crying. Her eyes move to the kitchen window. 
4 EXT. ELLIS' HOUSEBOAT - CONTINUOUS 4 
Ellis quickly ducks and mouths the word "shit." He slips under the window toward a metal carport that covers a boat, fish cleaning station, and industrial ice machine. The entire houseboat is anchored to the shore by two thick ropes tied to opposite ends of the flotilla. The ropes extend upward into the tops of enormous pine trees. Ellis sprints across a simple, wood-planked bridge to shore. His houseboat is one of several in a row along the riverbank. 
5 EXT. ELLIS' RIVERBANK - CONTINUOUS 5 
Ellis scurries into the treeline and arrives at a dirt path. Waiting for him there is NECKBONE(14), a scrawny kid with slicked back blonde hair wearing a FUGAZI T-shirt. He sits atop a smallish dirt bike. Ellis hops on the back. 
NECKBONE What the shit man? 
ELLIS Suck it. Drive. The bike spits up mud as they peel out down the trail. 
6 EXT. RIVERBANK - PREDAWN 6 
From a distance, the single headlight of the dirt bike snakes up and down, in and out of trees along the riverbank. 
ON THE BIKE, The sound of the engine rips through fog and trees illuminated by the straining headlight. 
7 EXT. RIVERBANK - DAWN 7 
The boys emerge from behind a sand covered hill. Now on foot, they are silhouetted against a light blue, morning sky. 
NECKBONE How old is she? 
ELLIS A Junior. 
At a collection of trees growing out of the water, the boys move branches away from a tarp covered boat. 
NECKBONE She's got nice titties. You talk to her? 
ELLIS Nah. 
NECKBONE You're gonna have to talk to her. 
ELLIS I know. 
NECKBONE Remind me when we get back to my house, Galen's got a book on that. Neckbone takes a spot up front in the small, flat-bottom boat. Ellis, a foot on the bank and one in the boat, launches them out into the water. 
8 EXT. RIVER - MORNING 8

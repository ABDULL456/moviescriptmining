Their difference from the usual road waif nomads who populate the Twister disturbs him. He exchanges a knowing look across the room with Big Emilio, as the group bellies up to the bar. 
SETH Whiskey! 
RAZOR CHARLIE (in English) You can't come in here. 
SETH What dya mean? 
RAZOR CHARLIE This is a private club. You're not welcome. 
SETH Are you tellin' me I'm not good enough to drink here? 
RAZOR CHARLIE This bar is for bikers and truckers only. (points his finger to Seth) You, get out! 
Big Emilio almost magically appears behind Seth and places HIS BIG BEEFY SAUSAGE-FINGERED HAND HARD on Seth's shoulder. 
BIG EMILIO (to Seth in Spanish) Walk, Pendaho. 
Seth slowly turns his eyes to the big hand on his shoulder. 
SETH (low) Take your hand off me. 
BIG EMILIO (Spanish) I'm going to count to three. 
SETH No, I'm going to count to three. 
BIG EMILIO Uno... 
SETH Two.. 
Jacob jumps in the middle. 
JACOB Now wait a minute, there's no reason to get ugly. There's just a misunderstanding going on here. You said this bar is for truckers and bikers, Well, I'm a truck driver. 
Everybody looks at Jacob. 
As Jacob talks he takes out his wallet. 
JACOB If you look outside your door, parked in your parking lot, you'll see a big ass recreational vehicle. That's mine. In order to drive that legally, you need a class two driver's license. That is the same license that the DMV requires truck drivers to carry in order to drive a truck. (he takes the license out of his wallet and lays it on the bar) That is me, and this is my class two license. This is a truck driver's bar, I am a truck driver, and these are my friends. 
Everybody's a little stunned after Jacob's speech. 
Razor Charlie picks up the license, looks at Jacob, looks at everyone in the party and smiles. 
RAZOR CHARLIE (to Jacob) Welcome to the Titty Twister. What can I get you? 
Seth BRUSHES OFF Big Emilio's paw. 
SETH Bottle of whiskey and five glasses. 
Razor Charlie's eyes go to Seth. Even though he has a big smile on his face, he looks like he's going to kill Seth. But instead he just says, 
RAZOR CHARLIE Coming right up. 
Razor Charlie goes for the bottle. Big Emilio gives the party one last look and walks away. Richard gives Jacob a buddy punch on the shoulder. 
RICHARD Good job, Pops. 
Seth's still frying an egg on his head. 
SETH That's just fuckin' typical. Biggest number one problem with Mexico, it's not service oriented. I was feelin' so good, and those fuckin' spies brought me down. 
Richard puts his arm around Seth. 
RICHARD Fuck 'em, shake it off. 
Razor Charlie brings the bottle and the glasses. Seth looks at the guy, still pissed. 
SETH You serve food, Jose? 
Razor Charlie knows Seth's taunting him with a racial slur, but he just smiles and says,

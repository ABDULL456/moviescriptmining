{"train": "GHOST RIDER \nWritten by \nDavid S. Goyer \nBased on the Marvel Comics character \nFirst draft April 11th, 2001 \nEXT. HIGH PLAINS - HILLSIDE - DAY \nA COYOTE lopes through shimmering heat waves. The sky above is a cloudless blue. \nWOMAN (V.O.) My Father used to say that the only way Evil came into your life was if you invited it. I'm not sure about that, at least not anymore. What I cLQ know is this: we are born alone, and we die alone, and what happens in between is all that matters. The choices we make, the people whose paths we cross -- these are the things that determine our fate. The coyote ducks through a hole in a chain-link fence, weaves through the rusted ruins of a -- \nDERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK Broken-down rides, weed-clogged machinery, sideshow trailers bleached bone-white. \nWOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D) Most stories start with a beginning. His began with an ending. I never knew where he really came from. I guess it's not important anymore. All I know is that he'd been running his entire life. Running for so long that he no longer knew whether he was running away from \nSOMETHING -- The coyote reaches a steep ridge, looks out over a patchy Southwestern town. \nWOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D) -- or towards it. \nSMASH CUT TO: \nINT. BAD IRON BIKE REPAIR - DAY \nSparks, noise, metal and grime. JOHN BLAZE (30s, ruggedly handsome) is running late. He sprints across the workshop floor, shedding his welder's kit as he heads for the time clock. CLUNK! He punches out -- but LITTLE MIKE (50s, trailer trash fast) has caught him in the act. \nLITTLE MIKE where do you chink you're going, Blaze? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBLAZE Sick, cutting out early. \nLITTLE MIKE The hell you are! Blaze jumps on his bike - a muscular, battered BSA. \nLITTLE MIKE (CONT'D) Get back to work or your ass is fired! \nBLAZE Aaa n? You say that every time. Blaze kicks-starts the bike. It ROARS thunderously. \nLITTLE MIKE (over the noise) Well I mean it this time! \nBLAZE (gunning the throttle) See you tomorrow, Little Mike! The bike HOWLS, hauls up on its back wheel. Screams out the shop leaving Little Mike holding his ears. The other workers WHOOP and HOLLER, especially when Blaze snags a pair of BOLT- CUTTERS from a passing tool rack on the fly. \nEXT. BAD IRON SHOP YARD/DIRT ROAD - DAY \nBlaze skids out of the yard, matching speed with a pickup which is just passing by. COOP is driving. JED and MURPHY are LAUGHING in back. Clearly, they're friends with Blaze. \nJED \n(SHOUTING) Skin of your teeth, man! \nMURPHY (tapping his watch) Yeah, we're on a tight schedule! \nBLAZE So what are you waiting for? Blaze burns away, leaving the pickup for dust. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. HIGH PLAINS - DAY \nA FREIGHT TRAIN thunders across the landscape. To the East Blaze and the pickup are coming on an intercept course. Blaze reaches the train first, climbs the gravel incline to the tracks. Matches its speed, pulls up alongside a bolted container car. He reaches back, pulls the cutters from his saddles bags -- -- and skillfully chops the lock with one hand. The heavy iron door slides open, pulled back by it's own inertia. Blaze throws the cutters inside, peels away -- -- and comes back with a vengeance, throttled to the max. He jams the front brake on at the last possible moment -- The bike cartwheels. Tail over head. Pulls a complete three- sixty up into the car -- \nINSIDE THE CAR -- and lands perfectly, screeching to a halt. Blaze WHOOPS his exhilaration. And if you don't believe this, watch extreme motocross as we CUT TO: \nTHE OPPOSITE DOOR being wrenched aside, revealing Coop's pickup holding steady alongside the train. Jed and Murphy ride the cargo bed like surfers. Blaze starts tossing boxes out of the car and into the truck. Jed and Murphy stack `em and rack `em. We get glimpses of the loot: CD Players, VCRs, personal packages, luggage -- \nJED Christ, Mickey was right on the money! \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nBlaze enters. The apartment is dark- TV flickers. Roxanne is sleeping on the couch. On the coffee table: Chinese leftovers, fortune cookies. \nBLAZE Hey. She's sound asleep. He crouches, touches her face. \nBLAZE (CONT' D) Hey. Roxanne barely stirs, deeply groggy. \nBLAZE (CONT'D) Everything's cool. \nROXANNE \n(SLURRED) You're going to jail. \nBLAZE No. No. Everything's okay. Jed and Murph just got a little boisterous at The Prairie Dog last night. Cops wanted to read us the riot act, that's all -- She yawns, curls up, starts to drift away again. \nROXANNE I was worried about you. And I don't like your friends. But Blaze won't let her go back to sleep. He jostles her. \nBLAZE Listen, I want to show you something -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nROXANNE I'm sure you do. But I'm half-asleep and you're an ass-hole. \nBLAZE I'm serious, Rox. This is important. He drags her up off the couch. Makes her stand up. She MOANS, scowls, but he gets her on her feet. \nROXANNE John, I have to go to work tomorrow \nBLAZE (offers her coat) Put your coat on. You'll be glad you did. Promise. It'll be an adventure. A mystery tour. \nROXANNE This better be good. She stomps to the bathroom. Blaze chuckles inwardly. Steals a fortune cookie from the left-overs, snaps it open -- The fortune is blank. Both sides. He tosses it away. \nCUT TO: \nCOYOTE EYES glittering black, watching. \nROXANNE (O.S.) (CONT'D) Alright, I'm here. Now what? \nEXT. DERELICT AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT \nBlaze and Roxanne creep through a hole in the outer fence, making their way to -- \nBLAZE Keep going. It's just up there. \nA BROKEN-DOWN CAROUSEL Must have been magnificent in its day. \nROXANNE I'm not riding one of those stupid horses. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBLAZE You don't have to ride, just climb up. She steps up onto the wooden platform, smiles back at him. \nROXANNE You're going to have to grow up one day, Johnny Blaze. \nBLAZE Not if I can help it. He follows her up onto the ride. She weaves through the wooden animals. Starting to enjoy this secret adventure. \nBLAZE (CONT'D) Keep going, keep going -- She comes around the other side, catches her breath. The whole valley is spread out before her -- a glorious scatter of diamonds on velvet. \nBLAZE (CONT'D) Uh-oh. \nROXANNE \n(TURNING BACK) What? \nBLAZE Ever hear of a carnival wedding? Roxanne shakes her head. Blaze is fiddling with a crisp, new dollar bill, folding it, making something. \nBLAZE Fuck. \nBLAZE'S REAR-VIEW MIRROR POV: The cop car is turning, heading back in their direction. \nROXANNE \nJOHN -- Blaze floors the gas. The speedometer leaps. \nEXT. RURAL ROAD - NIGHT \nThe EL Camino screams through the rain, with the cop car in dogged pursuit. TWO MORE POLICE CARS fall in behind them. \nINT. EL CAMINO - NIGHT \nBlaze fights to keep it together. The road ahead is dangerously winding. Tires SQUEAL as he hauls a sketchy turn. Roxanne gasps, fearful, bracing herself. The police are gaining. FLASHING LIGHTS flood the interior. \nROXANNE Slow down, John -- Another sketchy turn. Blaze spins the wheel, brakes, hard. Too hard. The car hydroplanes, finds purchase -- \nROXANNE (CONT ' D ) \nSLOW DOWN! LIGHTNING flashes, and suddenly, there's a \nCOYOTE or, the road, right in their path. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Blaze jerks the wheel. Roxanne SCREAMS. The car skids, slews off the road, CRASHES through a guard rail -- It plunges down a washout, flips end over end, shedding glass and wreckage, finally SLAMMING to a dead stop at the bottom of a rocky arroyo. \nINSIDE THE EL CAMINO Blaze stirs, blood streaming down his face. The windshield is blown open. Rain pours in. \nBLAZE Roxanne --? He struggles to free himself from his seat, SEES a torn seat belt hanging beside him -- the passenger seat mr)ty. \nBLAZE (CONT'D) Roxanne?! \nEXT. ARROYO - NIGHT \nBlaze scrambles out through the broken windshield. Falls off the wreck onto the steep, muddy incline. He tries to stand, can barely manage to crawl. \nBLAZE (terror seizing him) \nROXANNE!!! \nON ROXANNE lying ten yards away, unconscious, maybe dead. Blaze scrambles to her, rolls her over. He hauls her into his arms, SOBBING, the two of them covered in mud and glass and God knows what. \nTROOPERS are coming down the incline, guns drawn, FLASHLIGHTS beaming. They descend on Blaze, crying to pull him free of Roxanne. \nBLAZE (O.S. ) (CONT'D) Let me see her! God-Dammit! I have a right to see her -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nANGLE ON Blaze, grief-struck, handcuffed, thrashing about as Troopers try cc restrain him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBLAZE Get your fucking hands off me! Lucas Cole, the deputy who questioned Blaze earlier, approaches. Blaze SEES him and calms down a little. \nBLAZE (CONY' D) Please. Just let me see her. Cole nods to his men, who ease up on Blaze. He guides Blaze over to an observation window -- \nTHEIR POV Roxanne lays in a surgery bay, DOCTORS and NURSES milling around her. \nDOCTOR (O.S.) Mr. Blaze --? Blaze turns, SEES a nervous DOCTOR standing behind him. \nBLAZE Is she going to make it? \nDOCTOR (blinks, stutters) Mr. Blaze, I -- \nBLAZE )_a ch= going r4 make i r? \nNOMI It's too much, baby. Put it back. I don't have enough money for that. Rain stares right at Nomi -- and brazenly slips the doll into her coat pocket. Nomi glances at the Clerk. He didn't notice. \nEXT. SEVEN ELEVEN/DEADFALL GAS STATION - DUSK \nIt's pouring rain. Nomi and Rain hurry across the muddy lot towards a ratty pickup. \nCARRIGAN (O.S.) Yeah, I found her. Came back to be with her dying grandpappy. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOT BILLY-RAY CARRIGAN (30s) paces under an tire bay awning, talking on a cell-phone. He's handsome, charming, but there's evil lurking within that slick exterior. A pencil- thin scar runs just under one eye. \nCARRIGAN (CONT'D) Don't worry. She's got the kid with her. Carrigan watches Nomi and Rain climb into the pickup. The pickup chokes to life, carves out of the lot. Carrigan nods \nTO -- -- LANDSDALE ( 40s), a stone-faced criminal, who motions to five other thugs lounging nearby -- FUSCO, ALBRIGHT, CHUDACOFF, LLOYD and ODELL. \nCARRIGAN (CONT'D) (listening, impatient) I remember the deal. Just make sure you bring the money. He hangs up, follows his men to a couple of trucks waiting nearby -- a dusty Tundra for Albright, Chudacoff, Odell and Lloyd; an old Bronco for Landsdale, Fusco and Carrigan. Carrigan pulls a Glock from his waistband, chambers a round. \nCARRIGAN (CONT'D) Who wants to be a millionaire? Landsdale smiles back, an awful smile. \nWOMAN (V.O.) Some people are born bad. That's just the way they come into the world. Something goes wrong. Something breaks inside of them -- The trucks pull away, tires ploughing muddy tracks, passing two STRAY DOGS fighting over a bloody road-kill carcass. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - BEDROOM - DUSK \nBlaze sweeps aside a curtain, studies the slowly darkening landscape outside with tired resignation. \nWOMAN (V.0.) -- and they spend the rest of their lives trying to make up for it. CLICK' Blaze Curns on the TV, watches a weather snippet. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: PAN OVER Blaze's belongings on the bureau -- a duffle bag, old photographs of his previous life with Roxanne, a collection of blank postcards. Tucked amidst the photos is a sonogram featuring a ghostly image of an unborn child. \nWEATHERMAN -- scattered thunderstorms firing along a stalled frontal boundary. Damaging winds, hail, and isolated tornadoes will be possible across the Dakotas and Upper \nMIDWEST -- Blaze unfolds a tattered map and studies it. The map is crisscrossed with red lines tracing storms from city to city, along with all sorts of arcane, personal notations. Blaze traces his finger down to his present location: DEADFALL. \nEXT. ROAD - DUSK \nA lonesome service road threads through bleak wild-grass prairie. Nomi's pickup appears on the horizon. \nINT. NOMI'S PICKUP - DUSK \nNomi glances at Rain, who clutches her new skeleton toy. \nNOMI Seatbelt. Rain dutifully fastens herself in. \nNOMI (CONT'D) Hey, bug. You hungry? Rain shakes her head- \nNOMI (CONT'D) Want to listen to music? (off Rain's sullen shrug) Look, we won't have to keep moving around forever, okay? I'll figure something out. I promise. Rain looks at her mother. She's heard it all before- WHAM! Somebody rams the truck from behind. Rain SCREAMS. \nINT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK \nBlaze reaches for a pack of cigarettes, lights a match. He stares at the match flame for a moment -- for the flame is behaving strangely, bending towards Blaze as if it were drawn -o T>; m. Blaze shakes out the match, then retrieves -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTHE COYOTE/EAGLE COIN He stares at it ruefully, then places it on the map and sets it spinning. We get the sense that this is a ritual he has performed many times before. As we MOVE IN on the coin -- \nEXT. ROAD - DUSK \nCRASH! The Tundra rams Nomi's pickup again. Nomi fights to keep control. Aims for a turn-off up ahead. She hauls the truck into the turn, fights the roll-over, barely makes it -- -- but it's not fast enough. The Tundra and the Bronco make the turn too. Their HEADLIGHTS blaze into the cab. Nomi floors the gas. The pickup judders. The road here is bumpier, cracked and pocked. The Bronco swings out, pulls up alongside Nomi. She glimpses Landsdale, LAUGHING, urging Carrigan on. Carrigan cuts right, SLAMS the Bronco into Nomi's side. \nINT. LAKOTA MOTEL - DUSK \nOn Blaze, watching the coin with a growing sense of fatalism. Spinning. Spinning. But starting to slow now -- \nEXT_ ROAD - DUSK WHAM! The Bronco collides with Nomi's door again. Glass shatters- Rain WAILS, terrified. Wind and rain rush in -- BLOWOUT! Front offside tire. Nomi loses it, careens right, carves off the shoulder into a muddy culvert, SMASHING over rocks, sagebrush, fence posts and barbed wire -- After a few dozen tortured yards, the pickup shudders to a stop. The Bronco and the Tundra haul up nearby, engines CHUGGING like hungry beasts. \nDAMNIT, I NEED YOUR HELP!!! \nBLAZE \n(IRRITATED) \nLADY, I'VE HELPED YOU ENOUGH! Nomi smiles. Blaze just slipped up and they both know it. \nNOMI \nI THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GHOST RIDER!!! Angry with himself, Blaze throttles his bike to the max, howling over the next rise on his back wheel, probably hitting one-fifteen as he vanishes from view. Nomi skids to a stop on the shoulder and waits, her engine RUMBLING. Wind blows. Lizards click. After a long beat, Blaze reappears. Stops far away on the crest of the rise. Stares at her. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOOTHILLS - DUSK \nBlaze and Nomi weave their way through an obstacle course of rusted car hulks and assorted junk, heading for a battered Airstream trailer perched on the edge of a bluff. \n( -_ :N :N\"' 7- D) \nCONTINUED: \nNOMI I knew what you were the moment I saw you. I can help you -- jf you're willing to help mp-. I know things. \nBLAZE Like what? \nNOMI This thing that's riding you, the Ghost Rider. I guess it has a lot of names. But the one I grew up hearing was nagi ocanl sice. It means the Spirit of Vengeance. \nBLAZE You actually believe what you're telling me? \nNOMI You kidding? I'm pure-bred Dakota. I can hear the mountains talking to each other. And I saw you light up those pricks like Chinese New Year last night. They reach the trailer. Nomi fixes glaze with a stare. \nNOMI (CONT ' D ) what do you see when you sleep at night? The dead? The faces of the people you've taken? \nBLAZE \n(ANGRY) J,t takes them. Not me. Nomi nods, not sure she believes him. Enters the trailer. \nINT. AIRSTREAM - DUSK \nDark, shadowy. Curtains drawn tightly shut. Every corner crammed with bric-a-brac. On the TV: the football game. Blaze sits on a collapsing couch. Nomi hovers nearby. Her grandfather HENRI LAFORTE (80s, emphysemic), rambles on in Dakotan, pausing only to suck on his oxygen mask. He keeps his eyes on the game the whole time, never once looking at Blaze. \nBLAZE (aside, to Nomi) Does your grandfather understand English? \n(:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd,NT=NLE_-) \nCONTINUED: \nNOMI He understands. He just refuses to speak it. Laforte continues to ramble intermittently. Blaze shifts, impatient, finally sits forward. \nBLAZE Listen, I don't want to be an ass-hole, but can we just fast-forward the whole Yoda routine? The home team scores! Laforte WHOOPS wildly, loses his mask, COUGHS uncontrollably. Blaze stands. He's out of there. \nBLAZE (CONT'D) Feel better, old man. \nLAFORTE (rasping, in English) Give me the coin. Blaze stops, cocks an eyebrow at Nomi. She shrugs. Blaze hands over the coin. Laforte studies it, starts speaking in Dakota again. Nomi translates: \nNOMI The man you're looking for goes by lots of names. Coyote, Black Dog. In Dakota, he's Waka Sica. The Trickster. Look at him straight on, you might see a human. Look at him out of the corner of your eye at one of the in-between times -- dusk or dawn, you might see something else. \nBLAZE What does he want? \nLAFORTE Wacokico. Vengeance. \nBLAZE Why? \nNOMI Because it's his nature. Laforte elaborates. Nomi continues to translate. \nNOM I (CONT' D ) Long ago, Coyote could change his shape, chop his body into little pieces, causing all sorts of mischief. \n(MORE) (coNT=NLE\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nCARRIGAN I'm not a psychologist. She's a fucking freak, alright? Always has been. Sooner I get her out of my sight, the better. \nTHE COYOTE approaches the phone booth situated beside the rental office. Inside the booth, the man is half-seen. \nMAN She's the most important thing in your life, Carrigan. Make sure she arrives safely. \n(BEAT) And be careful. She'll kill if she gets the chance. The man hangs up, turns to look at the coyote staring up at him. Once again, we meet -- \nAMBROSE STARKE Same sky-blue eyes flecked with metal. Starke and Coyote stare at each other, indifferent to the storm raging around them- He starts towards the rental office. \nINT. LONE STAR RENT-A-CAR - DAY \nWindows RATTLE. The storm HOWLS. A portly rental agent, JIM PETROWSKY, is closing up shop. He gathers his papers, turns out the lights. A TV on the counter is on: \nWEATHERMAN -- experiencing extraordinary conditions. Tornadoes blanketing much of East Texas, with reports of extensive damage and gusts of up to seventy miles per hour -- As Pecrowsky turns off the TV, we hear the door CHIME. Starke enters, bringing a strong gust of wind with him. \nPETROWSKY Sorry, guy, I'm just closing up. Starke looks to a clock on the wall -- it's 4:55. \nSTARKE According to the hours posted outside, you're still open. \n{_.:D, NT7NI,=D) \nCONTINUED: \nPETROWSKY \n(EXASPERATED) Look, Mister, in case you hadn't noticed, there's a storm coming -- tornadoes, whatever. I'm trying to get out of here. Starke fixes Petrowsky with a stern gaze. \nSTARKE I would like to rent a car -- (reading Petrowsky's name tag) -- \"Jim\" . Something in Starke's tone gives Petrowsky pause. He glances to the window and the growing storm beyond. We SEE the coyote out there, watching from across the way. \nPETROWSKY \n(RELENTING) Okay, alright, have a seat. Starke sits. Petrowsky moves behind his desk. \nPETROWSKY (CONT'D) Now, Mr. --? \nSTARKE Starke. First name, Ambrose. \nPETROWSKY (typing in the name) Starke, okay. What kind of car were you looking for? Starke picks up a laminated placard featuring various cars. \nSTARKE What about the Cadillac Deville? I noticed you had one in your lot outside. \nPETROWSKY Sorry, already spoken for. How `bout a full-size car? I can give you a Chevy Malibu, Ford Taurus -- Starke deliberates. Outside, the storm seems to grow stronger. Petrowsky shifts in his seat, trying to mask his impatience. Were he observant enough, he might also notice that the wall clock has stopped. \n(C:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd VT=`7:,'-') \nCONTINUED: (2) \nPETROWSKY (CONT' D) You want the Taurus? Give you a good deal, mid-size price. $37.99 a day, can't beat that. \nSTARKE I had my heart set on the Cadillac, Jim. \nPETROWSKY \n(ANNOYED NOW) Caddy's taken. Now look, I'm trying to be accommodating here, but I really am in a hurry. So what's it going to be? Another beat as Starke stares Petrowsky down. Gradually, the lights in the office begin to dim. \nSTARKE The Taurus, then. \nPETROWSKY Great. Can I see a driver's license? Starke reaches into his jacket, handing over a license. Petrowsky types in the required information, trying to ignore the vague feeling of uneasiness settling over him. \nPETROWSKY (CONT' D ) How many days do you need it for? \nSTARKE Two, three -- \nPETROWSKY Any other drivers? \nSTARKE No. \nPETROWSKY And you'll be paying by --? \nSTARKE Cash. \nA HAND slips under the body of the car.Butit's not a human hand. It's the hand of a beast -- blackandtwisted, taloned. With a sudden movement, the hand flipsthecar up, sending the enter vehicle spiraling into theair.The Boy lies there, exposed like a bug beneath an upturned rock. He looks up -- \nWOMAN (V.0.) (CONT'D) And what seems like cruel fate is really only Nature, red in tooth and claw. \nTHE BOY'S POV We see a BRIEF FLASH of Starke. No longer a human silhouette, but a SNARLING, lupine beast. The Trickster. The Black Dog. Rushing towards us with open jaws as we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BADLANDS - DAWN \nA HUMMER races along a desolate stretch of highway, passing through an inhospitable landscape of buttes, mesas, and cacti. \nINT. HUMMER - DAWN \nCarrigan drives. Landsdale rides shotgun, dozing. Odell is in back with Rain, her hands tightly bound. She keeps to herself, clutching her skeleton doll, stares out at the passing landscape. Odell offers her a bag of chips. \nODELL Want some food, kid? Rain doesn't respond. Odell rustles the bag. \nODELL (CONT'D) C'mon. Eat a chip or something. \nCARRIGAN She's not gonna eat, Odell. Just shut up and get some sleep. \nODELL I can't sleep. Every time I close my eyes, I see the face of that thing, Lloyd \nBURNING -- (shaking his head) -- Christ. \nCARRIGAN Just put it out of your head. \nODELL If I could put it out of my head, I wouldn't be awake now, would I? Landsdale stirs. Carrigan gestures at the barren landscape. \nCARRIGAN Look out there, what do you see? \nLANDSDALE Dick. \nCARRIGAN That's right. Miles and miles of nothing. And there's a lot of weird shit running around in that nothing. How many people you know seen a UFO, huh? Ten? Twenty? Hell, it's on every goddamn paper at the supermarket. You believe that shit, the whole country's being overrun by those bug-eyed motherfuckers. \n(CAN\":NC,'.-) \nCONTINUED: \nLANDSDALE (nodding, eyes closed) Probe you in the ass, they get the chance. \nODELL What's your point, Mr. Serling? \nCARRIGAN My point is; everybody's seen somethina. Ghosts, aliens, Bigfoot, whatever -- \nODELL This wasn't no freaking Bigfoot! You see what it did to Albright? Punched his head clean off! \nCARRIGAN Look, I don't know what that thing was. All I know is, Starke's paying us a butt- load of money to deliver the kid to him. We were told we'd see things and we were told to look the other way. You want to cut out? I'll pull over right here. \nLANDSDALE Keep your shirt on, B. We didn't come this far just to limp home with nothing. Right, Odell? Odell settles back into his seat, uneasy. \nODELL I guess. But I'd still like to know what that thing was. \nRAIN He's the Ghost Rider. Everybody looks at her. It's the first thing she's said. \nCARRIGAN \n(CHUCKLING) \"The Ghost Rider\"? Get that off the back of an Oakridge Boys album or something? You think that shit scares me? \nRAIN It should. He's going to kill you all. \nODELL \n(FREAKING OUT) See? SiE? ! \n(MORE) (CO.JT N =i) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nODELL (CONT' D) That's what I'm talking about! Fucking Chatty Cathy sitting back here with me! Carrigan glances in the rear-view mirror, makes eye-contact with Rain, does his level-best not to be spooked. \nNOMI Never thought I'd be back here. They pass cautiously through the front yard. Nomi's pickup is parked nearby. The front door bangs back and forth. Nomi pulls a revolver from her waist-band. \nBLAZE I think they're gone. Off Nomi's look, Blaze points at tire tracks in the dirt. \nBLAZE (CONT'D) Dual tracks. Looks like your old man switched to a Hummer. \nINT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - DUSK \nWindow panes RATTLE. The lights don't work. Blaze and Nomi pick their way through food containers and discarded detritus. \nBLAZE (CONT'D) Guess the boys camped out for a while. \nTHE LIVING ROOM Dead leaves twirling. One whole side of the room is burned open, blackened and charred, the remaining timbers sealed with plastic sheeting. Nomi opens a drawer, rifles through singed papers -- finds an old PHOTO of her and Carrigan. \nNOMI Listen, those things Vince said -- \nBLAZE You don't have to explain yourself to me. \nNOMI Some of them are true. \nBLAZE Doesn't make you a bad person. \nCONTINUED: Nomi nods, but she's clearly agitated. Blaze crouches, traces his fingers over a stain on the wall. He can FEEL something. He shuts his eyes, opens them -- \nBLAZE'S POV (THE PAST) The room, many years earlier. Carrigan backhands Nomi across the face. The silent moment is caught in motion so slow it's virtually a tableau. \nBACK TO THE PRESENT \nBLAZE (CONT'D) He used to hit you. A statement, not a question. She nods. \nINT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nNomi is reluctant to enter. Blaze is inside, SEES her hesitation -- she's staring at the bed. \nNOMI You can see the past? \nBLAZE Just echoes, sometimes. \n(BEAT) Tell me about Starke. Nomi hesitates, not wanting to relive this. \nNOMI I was dying. I'd shot myself full of Billy's best gear. Figured I'd teach him a lesson and go out in style. Blaze nods, but he doesn't see Nomi now. He SEES -- \nBLAZE'S POV (THE PAST) -- Nomi as she waS. An inch away from eternity. She is lying on the bed, staring upwards, shallow breaths- Above her, a MOTH flutters by a light, casting distorted shadows. \nBLAZE (V.O.) But it felt like a mistake. \nNOMI ON THE BED \n(WHISPERS) I don't want to die. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: The lights begin to dim. We hear FOOTSTEPS approaching, muted and distorted, A SHADOW falls across Nomi -- \nSTARKE stands above her. There are OTHER SHADOWS drifting in behind him. Things better left half-glimpsed. Coyotes. Beasts. \nNOMI (V.O.) He smiled and said -- As Starke starts to speak, we hear: \nBLAZE'S VOICE \"You look like -- \nBACK TO THE PRESENT Blaze finishing the phrase, knowing the punch-line too well. \nBLAZE -- you could use some help.\" Nomi nods, hugs herself. \nNOMI And I took it. What else was I going to do? I don't know what happened after that. I'm not sure I ever want to -- (beat, struggling) All I know is, nine months later, Rain was born. \nFLASHBACK IMAGES Silent, disjointed. The moth. Nomi's face, terror-stricken. Starke, eyes alight with malice and mischief. \nBACK TO THE PRESENT Nomi turns away, trying to banish the memory. \nNOMI (CONT'D) Billy-Ray hated her from the moment she was born. He knew she wasn't his, knew she was different -- (re: the charred timbers) If I didn't leave he would've killed us both. \nINT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - BEDROOM - NIGHT \nRodenburg buckles his pants, goes to the doorway, peers cautiously into the passage beyond. \nRODENBURG'S POV: Flaming leaves burn and twirl at the far end. Firelight flickers. The SCREAMS still come, sporadic and terrible. Rodenburg's mind is racing. He motions to Pennebaker, who drags Nomi off the bed and strong-arms her to the door. \nINT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nRodenburg leads, gun ready. \nRODENBURG Doyle? Smoke and CRACKLING NOISES are building rapidly. The SHRIEKS persist, and those burning leaves are everywhere. Then -- --- movement in the living room! Rodenburg draws a bead but it's Weingrod, pushing through the plastic sheeting, fearful, eyes darting. He speaks in a strained whisper. \nWEINGROD What's going on, man? Where's Oswalt? GUNFIRE! Outside! CRASH! Something hits the house. Then more SCREAMS, more GUNFIRE, and a RUMBLE so deep it's deadly. Pennebaker panics, pushing past Rodenburg. \nPENNEBAKER I want out of here, I'm getting out! \nRODENBURG Keep your fucking voices down! \nWEINGROD He's burning the house, man! He's \nBURNING THE-- RED-HOT CHAINS whip viciously around Weingrod's head and torso. Then he's wrenched backwards, hauled straight through the plastic sheeting -- \nTHE GHOST RIDER bursts through the melting plastic, hauls his red-hot monster bike up on its back wheel -- Rodenburg and Pennebaker run for their lives, falling into the fire-lit passage. The Ghost Rider screeches across the living room, setting the place aflame as he passes through. Nomi leaps aside as a sheet of fire burns where she was, SEES the fiery monster crash straight through the wall -- Rodenburg and Pennebaker run through the flames, stumbling over Doyle's charred body -- \nEXT. CARRIGAN'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nThey burst out the front door, clothes alight, racing across the yard towards their vehicles. Rodenburg looks back -- The Ghost Rider EXPLODES through the front of the house, skids to a halt, flicks out a chain -- and snags Rode burgs ankle. He falls, SCREAMING. The chain retracts -- Pennebaker reaches his vehicle, struggles with the door - TheGhost Rider thrusts a clawed hand outwards,clenchesthe air and hauls it back in. Like an explosion in reverse, 4,11 fire is sucked violently back into his hellish being. A frozen moment. All terrified eyes on the Ghost Rider Then he lets rip. Hurls the energy back out as a torus of white hot fire that expands across the yard, BLASTS Rodenburg's shirt from his back, SMASHES Pennebaker against his vehicle -- The vehicles EXPLODE, gas tanks rupturing. Pennebaker is blown to pieces. Rodenburg SCREAMS, shields his face. Fire and debris rain down in every direction. The Ghost Rider looms over him. More accurately, it's -- \nGHOST BLAZE Half man, half monster, his pitiless skull-face hazing and flickering between human and inhuman states. \nGHOST BLAZE Where are they taking the girl? Rodenburg whimpers. Ghost Blaze grabs Rodenburg's hair, wrenches his head back. \nGHOST BLAZE (CONT'D) Where. Are_ They. Taking. Her? \nRODENBURG \n(BEYOND TERRIFIED) North! They're headed North, into Oregon, oh, god, fuck -- \nGHOST BLAZE Where? \nRODENBURG I don't know exactly, Jesus, I don't know! \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Blue-white fire floods down Blaze's arm and engulfs Rodenburg. The poor man screams, struggles to break free -- aze simply crrows Otte ana ac and the Ghost Rider's evil countenance submerges every trace of Blaze's humanity. Then it's over. The flames evaporate. Rodenburg's corpse crumbles to dust. Wind HOWLS. The Ghost Rider is gone. \nON BLAZE He SEES the corpses, the burning vehicles, tries to deny the horror. But it's always the same -- another swath of destruction left in his wake, another righteous atrocity. \nNOMI He told you everything he knew. She's ten yards away, shaking. Not going to come any closer. \nNOMI (CONT'D) Told you everything -- \n(BEAT) -- you didn't have to do that. \nBLAZE You asked for my help. I warned you what you were getting into. More a statement than an excuse. There are POLICE SIRENS on the wind. Blaze starts walking towards the pickup. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MOTEL - NIGHT \nA sub-par motel 6. Nomi's battered pickup is parked outside. We HEAR Blaze's tortured MOANS coming from within. \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nBlaze sits in a chair, shirt off, Nomi at his side. She's trying to help him patch up his wounds, but the enormity of the damage and the sheer amount of blood is daunting. \nNOMI I don't -- I don't know what else to do for you -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNOMI (almost afraid to ask) What about the baby? Blaze just shakes his head. \nBLAZE It's funny. That kid was supposed to be my second chance. Rox and I used to talk about it -- how things'd be different after she was born. Nomi didn't expect his honest vulnerability. \nNOMI Maybe that's why we have them \nBLAZE What, kids? \nNOMI \n(NODDING) So we can make amends for all the royal fuck-ups we've perpetrated on the world. God knows I've had my share. (beat, pained) I just don't want her to have to pay for the things I've done. You know? Blaze nods. He knows all too well. He and Nomi drive on in silence for a beat, their thoughts turning inwards. \nNOMI (CONT'D) Can I ask you something? Honestly? (off Blaze's nod) What're you going to do when you find Starke? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBLAZE Make him pay, somehow -- \n(UNCERTAIN) I don't know. How do you beat the Devil? Walk up and bitch-slap him? Pretend you're Schwarzenegger and fire a bazooka up his hind ass? I'm basically making this up as I go along. Nomi smiles. \nNOMI I'm sure you'll figure something out. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CARRIGAN'S HUMMER - TRAVELLING - NIGHT \n-- Rain looking out through the truck's moon roof, watching stars passing overhead. As the sky above slowly brightens in time-lapse, Rain's eyes grow lidded. She sleeps, clutching her skeleton toy and -- \nINT. CARRIGAN'S HUMMER - TRAVELLING - DAY \n-- waking sunlight floods the cabin. New shift. Odell drives. Rain rides shotgun. Carrigan and Landsdale are sacked out in back. The radio drones, laced with STATIC. Tedium. No one slept well. Carrigan stares out at the passing plains, expertly cutting a deck of cards one-handed. He SEES a scarecrow go by, standing ragged in the middle of nowhere. Then his cell phone RINGS. Carrigan flips it open -- \nCARRIGAN Yeah? Based on his facial expressions, the news isn't good. He sighs, disconnects the call. Landsdale cocks an eyebrow. \nCARRIGAN (CONT'D) Rodenburg's dead. Oswalt, Weingrod, all those other inbred losers too. (off Landsdale's look) Looks like my ex-bitch has hooked up with the fire guy -- In the rear-view mirror, Odell's eyes grow wide. \nODELL No fucking way -- Carrigan ponders, nods to Landsdale. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARRIGAN We're going to need reinforcements, some kind of escort to the meet. \nLANDSDALE I know a guy. Got some boys given over to wickedness and such. \nCARRIGAN (tosses him the phone) Make the call. \nRAIN (0.5.) He'll find me, you know. Her voice makes Odell jump. He thought she was asleep \nODELL (fretful, pleading) \nBILLY-RAY -- \nCARRIGAN (to Rain, leans forwards) Hey, kiddo, you're worrying my boy here. So shut your goddamn mouth -- \nRAIN You can't tell me what to do. You're not my father. Wow. The truck collectively holds its breath. Carrigan settles back, but he's pissed. \nCARRIGAN You better believe that, sweetheart. I'm just the dumb-ass that financed your whole fucking life. You and your mother both. And what did I get for that selfless act of stupidity? She burned down the house and gave me something to remember her by. He's referring to the scar under his eye. Rain turns away. Huddles against the door. \nLANDSDALE Believe me, I could care less what Starke wants with you. Make you into a fucking hood ornament if he wants to. It's not like you came springing out of my loins. Only thing I care about now is getting what's mine, and that's -- \n(MORE) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nLANDSDALE (CONT'D) (counting on his fingers) -- payment and retribution, got it? She's not listening. Her bound hands are secretly pushed down into the tight gap between the seat and the door. \nBlaze and Nomi crest a rise in the field, hunker down: \nTHEIR POV: We can see the main compound of the quarry from here. Landsdale is in view, having a smoke by the guardhouse. \nNOMI You think she's in there? Blaze nods. \nNOMI (CONT'D) Then let's go -- Nomi starts forward, but Blaze pulls her back. \nBLAZE No. We'll wait. \n(POINTEDLY) Dawn's less than an hour away. \nNOMI (taking out her gun) You wait. I'm heading in. \nBLAZE Look, they're not going anywhere. \nNOMI You don't know that. This is probably the best chance we'll get. They're sitting ducks. We can do this if you -- \nBLAZE If I what? Burn them alive? Eat their spirits? \n(DRAWING CLOSER) \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBLAZE (CONT'D) You still get it, do you? The Ghost Rider whales on whoever's got it coming, but it's Johnny Blaze that gets to remember their faces. And I Lb remember them. Every last one. Just then, we hear the RUMBLE of approaching MOTORCYCLES. Lots of them. Blaze turns, SEES a line of BIKERS chugging up the service road on ratted-out Harleys. \nNOMI They know we're coming, don't they? Blaze nods. Once again, Fate is royally fucking him. \nNOMI (CONT'D) I'm going in. You with me or not? \nEXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - NIGHT \nLandsdale opens the main gate. The bikers THUNDER into the compound -- low-rent Hell's Angel types culled form the shallow end of the gene pool known as the Gray Gargoyles. ARLO SKINNER, the Gargoyle's CEO, climbs off his hog, adjusts his nut-sack. As he approaches Landsdale. GUNT and CHESTER PULSIFER, his identical twin lieutenants, fall in behind. \nARLO Brotherman. \nLANDSDALE Arlo. \nARLO \n(GRINNING) I believe you know the Pulsifer Brothers, Chester and Gunt? \nEXT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ELSEWHERE - NIGHT \nBlaze and Nomi scramble over a fence, then drop down, crouch- running to avoid a security camera. They hug the shadows. At least a dozen of the Gargoyles are in view, lounging around, shooting the shit. \nBLAZE I'll find her. You stay here. Nomi moves to protest, but Blaze silences her. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nBLAZE (CONT'D) If things go South and the Ghost Rider takes over, I can't guarantee he won't -- \nNOMI I know. I'm on my own. (beat, more plaintive now) , Just bring her back to me. That's all I care about. \nBLAZE \n(NODDING) Start disabling the bikes. Last thing we need is a gang of pissed-off speed freaks on our tail. Rip out all the coil wires --- Blaze points to the motorcycle nearest him. Nomi rolls her eyes and pulls out a switchblade, deftly slicing through a fuel line. Gasoline leaks onto the ground. \nBLAZE (CONT'D) \n(CHAGRINED) -- or you could do that. As Blaze creeps away: \nNOMI \nBLAZE -- (as he turns back) Whatever happens -- \nBLAZE You're welcome. Blaze leaves. Nomi starts in on the other bikes. \nLANDS DALE He's telling the truth, Arlo. The guy ain't human. Saw him torch Albright and Chudacoff with my own eyes. \n(CONTINUED) \n- CONTINUED: \nBACK IN CORRIDOR Blaze presses against the wall, desperately trying to rein the Ghost Rider in -- but FOOTSTEPS are coming. A Gargoyle is round; c the corner! \nINT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT \nGunt rips open his shirt, shows a chest covered in tattoos. \nGUNT Well, I say bring him on. You see this ink? That's a hundred hours under the needle. A motherfucking canvas of pain. He and Chester here, we're not afraid of fuck-diddly! \nINT. QUARRY COMPOUND - CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nThe Gargoyle passes the doorway, lights up a smoke. Or tries to. The flame from his Zippo is bending sideways. He tries a couple more times. Same thing. Weird. \nON BLAZE hidden in a dark alcove, struggling to contain himself. If the Gargoyle turns he will surely see him. The Gargoyle studies the flame, then notices an OPEN WINDOW nearby. He shuts it, lights his cigarette, turns back -- b= Blaze has moved on. \nINT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT \nArlo settles back in his chair. \nARLO If this guy's as lethal as you say he is, I want fifty for me, another fifty for the club. Only you can't let the boys know we're takin' a 50K rake off the top, see? \nCARRIGAN How `bout sixty and I'll throw in a kilo of coke? \nARLO \n(INCREDULOUS) Coke? That's like selling snow to Eskimos. You think I'm some kind of crack-smoking foolio or something? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nCARRIGAN \n(SIGHING) Seventy, then. Arlo reaches into his shoulder-holster, whipping out a mean looking nickel-plated Colt 44 Anaconda. \nARLO Ninety, and not a nickel less, you fucking pillow-biter. \nINT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nBlaze continues, agitated. Where the fuck is the kid? He looks through a doorway, SEES -- \nTEN OR MORE brutish gargoyles drinking beer and cleaning their weapons. Blaze drops back. His snarling face contorts, starts to assume that awful skullish quality. The Ghost Rider wants out. mow. But Blaze fights, shoves it back down and deep. SOMETHING moves to Blaze's right -- a TINY WHITE FIGURE, lolling and flopping at the far end of the passage. \nEXT. QUARRY - COMPOUND - NIGHT \nNomi slices through another fuel line, inadvertently drawing the attention of a Gargoyle who was taking a leak. He zips up his jeans, starts towards her -- \nINT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT \nCarrigan grins, trying to calm the situation. \nCARRIGAN E a sy, gentlemen. No need to get all truculent on me. \nARLO Truculent? You get that out of a Scrabble dictionary or something? What the fuck does \"truculent\" mean? (grabbing Carrigan by his shirt) I'll tell you what it means. It means \nFUCK YOU! \nINT. QUARRY COMPOUND - ANOTHER CORRIDOR - NIGHT \nBlaze stares, hypnotised, his face flickering from skull to flesh and back again. The tiny figure is Rain's SKELETON DOLL, held upright, unsteady, by some unseen force. \nTHAT MOMENT, ELSEWHERE - RAIN'S FACE Extreme mental concentration. Temples pounding. Her eyes are fluttering, rolled to white. \nBACK TO BLAZE as he starts towards the toy skeleton. He's in agony now, each breath a cough of fire, each footstep igniting the floorboards. He SEES a storage room up ahead -- \nINT. QUARRY OFFICE - NIGHT \nSimple and clean. Rain locks the door, goes to the window and opens it wide -- a beautiful day outside, hills rolling down to a busy town a mile distant. Nomi drops her bag, sits wearily on the bed, peels her jacket open -- revealing a nasty shoulder wound. Burned to the bone, the impression of fingers clearly evident. Rain hurries to help, rummages antiseptics and bandages from Nomi's bag. Together, they clean the wound. Nomi's pain is clear, but she keeps it quiet. \nRAIN Are we safe now? Nomi regards her sadly. She's never been one to tell lies. \nNOMI Honey, I don't know if we'll ever be safe. Rain nods, knew the answer instinctively. Something about her look -- far too fatalistic for a child her age. \nRAIN He talks to me sometimes. \nNOMI Who? \nRAIN My father -- (beat, hesitant) -- when I'm dreaming. \nNOMI \n(FEARFUL) What does he say? Rain starts to cry now, suddenly overwhelmed. Despite her eerily calm demeanor, she's still a child. And a frightened one at that. \nRAIN I don't want to be like him, mom. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nNOMI You won't. \nRAIN \n(SOBBING) You don't know that. \nNOMI Yes, I do, baby -- Nomi hugs her, desperate, as if the world were ending. Outside, across the land, the sun shines gloriously bright. \nNOMI (CONT'D) -- yes I do. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - BLAZE'S CELL - DAY \nOn Blaze, immobile. Waiting for nightfall. Shadows lengthen around him in TIME-LAPSE as the day begins to die. He starts to shake. Tears streak from his eyes, burn his cheeks. \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - CARRIGAN'S CELL - DAY \nOn Carrigan, in his cell at the end of the corridor. He's nervous, cutting a deck of cards. \nEXT. LANDSCAPES - VARIOUS - DAY/DUSK \nAnts feed on a praying mantis. An owl pulls at a recently killed mouse. Day TIME-LAPSES to dusk. Thunder RUMBLES. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MOTEL ROOM - DUSK \nRain sleeps. Storm fingers scratch at the window. Nomi steps out of the shower. Towels off. Checks on Rain. She contemplates her sleeping child a moment, then taps a pack of Camels, realizes she's out. \nEXT. MOTEL - WALKWAY - DUSK \nNomi quietly closes the door. Walks to the far end where the vending machines are HUMMING. CLUNK. A fresh pack of smokes. She tears it open, then notices -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nA MOTH fluttering by an outdoor light, casting distorted shadows on the stucco wall. Nomi stares, uneasy, something tugging at- her memory as we SEE -- \nA BRIEF FLASH OF THE PAST Nomi back on the bed, ODing. The SHADOW of Starke falling over her. The moth fluttering above. \nBACK TO THE PRESENT as Nomi turns to the parking lot, SEES a coyote slouching out of the gathering darkness. And she knows. 5-ba fucking knows. \nWOMAN (V . 0 . ) My father used to say that the only way evil came into your life -- \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - BLAZE AND CARRIGAN'S CELLS - DUSK \nBlaze waiting, internal. Carrigan manically cutting his deck of cards. Over and over. Blaze suddenly CRIES OUT, throwing himself onto the floor. He begins to writhe as the other prisoners jeer at him. \nINT. COUNTY JAIL - NIGHT \nFADE IN from white. Another aftermath. A circus of PARAMEDICS, POLICE, FIREMEN and REPORTERS. Every corner is blackened, every bar twisted and melted. Charred CORPSES are scattered like matchsticks. \nBOOTS are coming. We've seen them before. These boots belong to -- \nSTARKE navigating his way through the bedlam. He passes between rushing emergency personnel, steps over a writhing VICTIM -- -- but no one seems to notice his presence. And as he progresses to the far end of the cell block, the cacophony fades, leaving only his FOOTSTEPS as he turns into -- \nCARRIGAN'S CELL Carrigan is terribly burned, but still clinging to life. Frantic paramedics are running an IV, struggling to stabilize him. His fear-filled eyes grow dim, then abruptly snap into focus as he SEES -- \nSTARKE (O.S.) You look like you could use some help. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: -- Starke standing over him, his gaze stoic and pitiless. \nSTARKE (CONT' D) You lost her, Carrigan. What happened? \nCARRI GAN (a choking sob) -- you didn't tell us -- what he was Carrigan starts to slip away. The SOUNDS of the outside world begin to intrude once more. Starke kneels, touching a hand to Carrigan's chest. The world ebbs away again. The paramedics continue their work, oblivious. Carrigan MOANS. \nCARRIGAN (CONT'D) -- please, I don't want to die -- Starke's arctic eyes gleam bright with mischief. \nSTARKE If I could save you, would you be willing to make a deal? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. DESERT CEMETERY - DAWN \nBlaze sits against an old grave marker, gun in hand. Thousand-yard stare in his eyes. He contemplates the gun \nSILENT MEMORIES assault him -- good times with Roxanne, happy times, making the onrush that much more unbearable. We INTERCUT -- \nROXANNE, radiant at the beach. Flickering sunshine makes her squint. \nBACK TO BLAZE, here and now, cocking the gun, turning it back on himself. \nROXANNE folding clothes, seen through a sunny doorway. \nBACK TO BLAZE, fingering the trigger of the gun, edging closer to the unknown, the terrors that the afterlife holds for him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nROXANNE Her laughing face, loving Blaze from across a dinner table. \nBACK TO BLAZE suppressing a sob. The pain is too much. It's overwhelming -- \nROXANNE and Blaze at the obstetrician's. On the sonogram monitor, w e SEE unborn child shifting positions within Roxanne's womb, PUSH IN on the eerily beautiful image and -- \nBACK TO BLAZE Fuck it. He presses the barrel against his forehead. Squeezes his eyes tightly shut, compresses the trigger -- -- but he can't do it. He lowers the gun, weeping with frustration and -- freezes, head cocked like he heard a voice. He scans the cemetery: graves, trees, nothing. Then he spins around --- \nRAIN stands behind him, waif-like. Big, melancholy eyes. They stare at each other for a long time, not knowing what to say. \nRAIN My mother is dead. The statement hangs. Another death. Another failure of Blaze's part. \nBLAZE How--? \nRAIN My father found us, just like she knew he would. Rain looks down at Blaze's hand -- the gun resting there. Blaze meets her gaze and tucks the gun away, embarrassed. The wind picks up. Rain looks to the graves. \nRAIN (CONT' D) What do you think happens when you die? Do you think there's a heaven? \nBLAZE I don't know. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nRAIN \n(INSISTENT) But what do you think? Blaze studies Rain. This kid is hurting. What she needs now, is reassurance. And try as he might, Blaze just can' t seem to harden his heart against her. \nBLAZE Look, you must have a cot, something. The kid's hungry -- \nRHYMER (O.S. ) I'm sure we can figure something out. JOE RHYMER, 50s, approaches, silences Tolbein with a look. He's down to earth, capable, wearing a black shirt, cleric's collar, oily jeans, and muddy work boots. \nRHYMER (CONT'D) (offering his hand) Joe Rhymer. I'm the Padre. \nBLAZE This is Rain. \nRHYMER Rain? That's a pretty name. \n(TO RAIN) You hungry, Rain? Would you like something to eat? Rain nods. Rhymer ushers them inside. As he moves to follow, Tolbein stops him. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nTOLBEIN Bottom line, Father. There's something wrong with those two. Especially the kid. \nRHYMER Duly noted, Richard. \n(POINTEDLY) And overruled. \nANGLE ON A RAGGEDY FIGURE jutting into frame in the foreground. Blaze pauses at the threshold of the chapel, looks back, uneasy -- but it's just a SCARECROW being buffeted about by the wind. \nINT. MISSION - CHAPEL - DAY \nRhymer leads Blaze down the central aisle. The chapel is dark, lit by candle-light, crowded with scaffolding and drop- sheets. As Blaze walks, the flames of the candles bend in his direction -- as if drawn by some unseen magnetic force. \nBLAZE Those men outside -- \nRHYMER Most of them are on a work-release program. We're a halfway house for ex- offenders. We try to get people on their feet, reintegrate them into society. Blaze glances at Rain, apprehensive. \nRHYMER (CONT'D) (misreading Blaze's look) Don't worry, you're perfectly safe here. But of course, that's not what Blaze is thinking. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MISSION - KITCHEN - LATE AFTERNOON \nRain sits at the table, spooning her soup. Tolbein, Nunez and a few others watch them. Blaze watches them back, nonchalant in the face of their obvious hostility. \nEXT. COURTYARD - LATE AFTERNOON \nBUILDERS working. Men carrying provisions. There's a small vegetable garden in the center of the courtyard. Rain helps the GARDENER pull carrots. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Blaze watches from a distance, cleaned up, clothes laundered-- Rhymer approaches, gestures to the garden. \nRHYMER It's turned out beautiful, hasn't it? We try to be as self sufficient as we can, back to the earth and all that. He notices that Blaze is staring at the lowering sun. \nRHYMER (CONT'D) You any good with diesel engines? \nBLAZE I know my way around a flywheel housing. \nRHYMER Well I've got a generator out back that's been on life support the last few weeks. Mind helping me try to resuscitate it? Blaze looks at him curiously. \nBLAZE Sure. \nINT. BASEMENT - LATE AFTERNOON \nBlaze and Rhymer work by flashlight, tinkering with the old generator. There are a number of vehicles stored around them, including a pair of dusty motorcycles. \nRHYMER So how long have you been running? \nBLAZE What do you mean? \nRHYMER You know what I mean. You spend as much time around lost souls as I have, you learn how to read a man's face. \n(NODDING) You want to hand me that crescent wrench? Blaze hands Rhymer the wrench, who then makes an adjustment. \nRHYMER (CONT'D) Take the girl, for instance. She's not your daughter, is she? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COASTAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nBlaze rolls the Norton to a stop. Kills the engine. Sits back in the saddle and drinks in the night. The moonlit landscape is profoundly silent, the starry sky clear and awesome. Nothing stirs. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: Not a cricket, not a lizard. Just the moonlit expanse of ocean below. Then we hear THUNDER, like distant artillery. Blaze looks back over his shoulder -- \nBLAZE'S POV Distant thunderheads. LIGHTNING flickering. CLOSE ON Blaze, trying to drive Rain from his mind. We can SEE on his face that it's a losing battle -- for poor, cursed Johnny Blaze has finally understood his purpose on this earth. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MISSION - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nClaws and jaws and razor-beaks tearing frenziedly through wood and plaster and lathe. Rhymer, Rain, Nunez and Tolbein struggle to repel the monsters, beating them back with whatever is at hand -- -- but the jaw-beasts and razor birds are winning, forcing their way into the kitchen -- Nunz is snagged. Slashing claws swarm all over him. The others try to pull him free -- Rhymer wastes two more precious SHOTS, but Nunez is lost. Dragged SCREAMING into the storm of mouths and claws. The survivors fall back as the door gives and -- \nTHE SCARECROW pitches through the opening, lurching forward. Jaw-beasts fall in behind him. Razor birds whirl around his head. The survivors scramble for the far exit. Rain opens every gas burner on the grill as she passes by -- but the far exit is locked. And Rhymer doesn't have the key! BOOM! Rhymer shotguns the lock! The lock fractures, but the exit still won't open. Tolbein starts kicking. Rhymer aims \nAGAIN -- \nRAIN (tugging at Rhymer) Shoot the gas! \nRHYMER What? \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTHE SCARECROW advances. Bugs swarm from beneath his tattered feet. Every metal implement and surface rusts as he passes. \nRAIN (pointing at the grills) \nSHOOT THE GAS! Rhymer hears the ranges HISSING and FIRES. CHOOM! The gas fireballs, catches Scarecrow full-on sideways. He squeals, reels. Burning jaw-beasts writhe and howl. Rain falls to the floor, dropping the coyote coin. It spins furiously as we -- \nCUT TO: \nEXT. COASTAL HIGHWAY - NIGHT \nBlaze. Coming back. Ninety_ One hundred. Wind tears wildly at his hair, jacket. The bike shudders. The tachometer edges upwards -- One twenty. One twenty-five. Nitrous booster. The Norton SCREAMS. One thirty. One forty. One fifty -- HEAT streams off Blaze. FLAMES wisp from his nostrils. One sixty. One seventy. The tachometer SHATTERS. The engine smokes. The bike SHRIEKS, pushing the edge of mechanical reason. FLAMES explode from Blaze's mouth and eyes. His hands ignite. He CRIES OUT in agony. His body alters violently. His face warps. Bones crack and shift. Flesh shrinks and tightens as the skull-visage emerges. The bike changes too, red heat spreading throughout. Tortured metal SCREECHES. Straining machinery pops and bulges. Shafts lengthen into skeletal \"bones\". The saddle slouches. The tank distends -- WHOOMPF! The wheels ignite, then the whole bike. HELLFIRE streams, an extension of Blaze's rage. Blaze SCREAMS from the pit of his soul as the Ghost Rider claws itself into being, more manifest that ever before -- And that's when the bike really accelerates - -- so fast that its air wake churns the dust on each side. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: so fast that molten asphalt spumes from behind like lava. -- so fast that the goddamn camera can barely catch it and -- B-BOOM!!! The hellcycle breaks MACH 1, SONIC BOOMS rocking the landscape as we -- \nCUT TO: \nINT. MISSION - NIGHT \n-- the Scarecrow, savagely burnt by the blast, but unstoppable. He rises, cocks his head, hears something -- \nVARIOUS ANGLES - DINING ROOM, KITCHEN, STAIRCASE The jaw-beasts_ The razor birds. All pause. All listen. They know something's coming. Something fast. Something bad. We hear it now too -- the WHINE of an APPROACHING ENGINE. \nON THE COYOTE COIN wobbling to a stop, coyote side up. Realizing what's about to happen, the Scarecrow lets loose a GHASTLY WAIL and -- \nTHE GHOST RIDER erupts through the wall in DEEP SLOW MOTION, sending forth a majestic tsunami of fire and debris. The monster bike skids, carves floorboards like matchwood -- \nJAW-BEASTS AND RAZOR BIRDS hurl themselves out of its scorching path -- The Ghost Rider vaults from the saddle, sends the bike spinning at the scurrying monsters. It ninepins a few, takes out the rest as it impacts the wall like a nuke -- \nTHE CROW-THINGS are vanquished, squealing and flopping like living cinders. \nBUT THE JAW-BEASTS RECOVER, still aflame but very much alive. If anything, they seem emboldened by the fire. They circle the Ghost Rider, more and more of them joining the pack. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: \nTHE GHOST RIDER readies his chains. The jaw-beasts attack. Three dozen horrors pouncing and GNASHING. The Ghost Rider takes them.- Chains, flames, sheer power and force -- Spines snap. Lupine skulls burn. The Ghost Rider tears the monsters limb from limb. The room becomes the Seventh Circle of Hell, and at the heart of the Inferno, the Ghost Rider exults in the slaughter -- The whole mission is ablaze now, fire and churning smoke consuming everything in its path. Rhymer, Rain, and Tolbein run for their lives. \nINT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT \nEXT. MISSION - NIGHT \nThe whole mission quakes. A huge hole in the wall falls open, the Scarecrow barely manages to stop himself falling The stilt-like support columns bearing the weight of the overhanging mission begin to CREAK and bend. Some snap -- \nINT. MISSION - DORMITORY - NIGHT \nThe dormitory drops alarmingly, ten feet or more, the flooring canting precariously. Ghost Blaze stumbles, falls -- WHAM! Scarecrow grabs Ghost Blaze's neck. Squeezes tight. A WAVE OF DECAY AND CORROSION spreads over Ghost Blaze. He SCREAMS, his flesh putrefying, but Scarecrow will not let go -- \nON RAIN AND RHYMER Desperate for escape, the flames closing in on them. There's nowhere to go. Except a small HATCH, high up in the ceiling -- \nBACK TO SCENE Ghost Blaze HOWLS, in agony as the Scarecrow's superior evil dominates.

An instant in which Rhymer shoves Rain through the hatch -- An instant in which Scarecrow senses his own doom -- Because the Ghost Rider is back- But now he's more than the Ghost Rider. He's a white-hot nuclear bomb fairly vibrating with volcanic heat. And he DETONATES. An apocalyptic release that -- obliterates Scarecrow -- sends Rhymer ducking for cover -- bulges the dormitory's fractured walls and ceiling, lifting the ATTIC FLOOR mightily. HURLING Rain into the air! \nA FLAME TSUNAMI steamrollers through every room and passage, destroying everything in its path, consuming itself. \nINT.

He pushes up on his elbows, tiredly rises to his feet and -- \nTHE MISSION Topples. Ghost Blaze and Rain run -- but they're not going to make it. The whole room is dropging away at their heels! Ghost Blaze snatches up Rain, DIVES through a widening split in the wall even as -- \nEXT. MISSION - NIGHT \n-- the dormitory folds up and slides away from them, pitching over the hillside.

Then it lifts his terrible \nHEAD -- \nTHE FACE OF JOHN BLAZE Skeletal, aflame, but somehow still Johnny, his tortured visage recognizable even as the furnace blazes blue-white. His jaw bone pivots open to unleash an INHUMAN HOWL, at once predatory and tormented, a shriek of eternal damnation. Time speeds up again. The men run. The Ghost Rider accelerates from zero to sixty in a heartbeat. Lloyd runs fast as he can. Talk about pointless. The Ghost Rider seizes his head, drags him seventy yards, burning him black, discarding him -- The other men let rip. Guns blaze. BULLETS punch through the Ghost Rider, coming out his back as red hot slag. The demon hauls a deep curve, powers up onto his rear wheel -- \nALBRIGHT What the fuck?! WHAT THE FUCK?! Albright FIRES his shotgun. THUNDERING past like an Amtrak train, the Ghost Rider PUNCHES a flaming fist right through Albright'-, face. That's it for the others. They scramble for the trucks. WHOOSH! The Ghost Rider lashes out with his chains, lassos Chudacoff. He SCREAMS as the metal sears his body, falls heavily, burning -- The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, summons something internal and lets it loose -- a blast of PURE HELLFIRE that courses down the chains and engulfs Chudacoff, immolating him.

He raising his skeletal hand, clenches it, and suddenly we are -- \nINSIDE THE BRONCO'S ENGINE A series of MACRO SHOTS as we move amongst the pistons, cylinders, and intake manifolds. The mixture of vaporized fuel and air within the engine begins to ignite, but then the miniature explosions seem to contract and implode in upon themselves and we are -- \nBACK OUTSIDE with Carrigan. His truck won't start. Somehow, the ?host Rider has actin uished the flames within his engine. The Ghost Rider keeps coming, his skeletal claws/fingers white-hot now, throbbing with heat. He slices through the Bronco's door like a human oxy-acetylene torch, chopping the vehicle apart. Carrigan panics, drags Rain out the passenger door. But Fusco is still trapped inside. Can't get his seatbelt off. The Ghost Rider tears open the roof, bisects the vehicle and HURLS the front away, leaving Fusco cowering in the melted back seat. The Ghost Rider looms over Fusco, extending a skeletal claw -- \nFUSCO Oh God, please, I ain't nothing to do with nothin'. I ain't nothin'. Please, \nPLEASE! \nON CARRIGAN tugging Rain away from the horror, trying to ignore Fusco's terrible SCREAMS.

All he can do is stare into those awful pits, fall into them, as grisly IMAGES from his evil past spark and shred into his melting mind. Every act of violence, every crime he ever committed -- beatings, murders, acts of torture and revenge -- are now revisited upon Fusco tenfold. This is the PENANCE STARE, and Fusco is feeling it's full, hellish force. The Ghost Rider and Fusco SCREAM in sync. Carrigan and Rain can't look away. They stand transfixed -- Then it's over. The Ghost Rider drops Fusco into the mud. He lies there, shuddering, glassy-eyed, burned black but still alive, his brain irrevocably overloaded. And The Ghost Rider is somehow different too. Immobile. Internal. Then he looks up, past Carrigan. R;rht at. Rain. Rain stares back. But it's -- \nBLAZE'S FACE she SEES. An abject abyss of pain and shame and torment. And Rain's terror is forgotten for just that moment, replaced with something best described as empathy. \nLIGHT AND NOISE to the Ghost Rider's left. He turns -- the Tundra screams out of nowhere, slamming into him at sixty plus. \nINSIDE THE CAB LANDSDALE ducks the shattering windshield, leaps from the truck as it fills with fire -- The Tundra keeps moving, pile-drives the howling spectre square into a massive boulder.

She scrambles up to the lip, SEES the burning Tundra nearby, SEES her pickup hauling away into the night. She WAILS, tries to drags herself to her feet -- CREAK. The burning wreckage moves. Moves again. Nomi ducks down, watches, uncomprehending. The crumpled truck is hurled aside. Two tons. Tipped over like a packing crate. Nomi slips down into the gully, gasping with fear. HEAVY FOOTSTEPS and CRACKLING FIRE draw near -- Nomi dares to look up. The Ghost Rider stares down at her. Like Death itself. Imagine yourself face to face with a Great White, an unfathomable, impenetrable force of nature -- Then imagine that force turning away, sparing you. The world exhales. After a moment Nomi dares to look again: \nNOMI'S POV (THROUGH THE POURING RAIN) All she sees is a MAN, in tattered clothes, rolling a busted up motorcycle away into the darkness. \nCUT TO: \nINT.

Quinlan backs out through the curtain. Blaze sighs, tapes a thick gauze patch over the wound, eyes hunting. He SEES a drug cabinet, breaks into it. Fills his pockets. \nINT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nMoments later, Blaze is stumbling away. He pops the cap of a pill bottle, dry-swallows a half-dozen painkillers -- To his right, a PARAMEDIC TEAM works on the shrieking burn victim we saw earlier. Blaze stops, horrified -- It's FUSCO, eyes rolling wildly, charred nearly beyond recognition. Flailing and convulsing, fingers nothing but exposed, blackened bone -- \nON BLAZE, backing into a quiet corner. He suppresses a sob, fumbling a hypodermic as he fills it with stolen morphine. He jabs the spike into his leg, sags as the drug takes effect. After a moment, Blaze calms, gets his bearings, notices that he's leaning against a bulletin board on which is pinned -- \nA WANTED POSTER, helpfully illustrated with a mug-shot of Blaze's own face. Blaze tears the poster down, stuffs it in his pocket, then realizes that SOMEONE is watching him. He turns, SEES -- \nNOMI sitting on a nearby bed. Beaten, bruised, desolate.

He waves the shotgun at the others -- \nTOLBEIN Open the fucking door! DO IT! Nunez fumbles with the lock. Rhymer recovers, throws himself at Nunez, tries stop him from opening it. The pounding ceases. All eyes sweep to the door -- \nTWO BUTTONS roll through the gap between the bottom of the door and the floor, coming to rest at Rhymer's feet -- immediately oottina the floorboards beneath them. \nCARRIGAN (O.S.) (a skin-crawling whisper) I can see you, Priest. I can see every last one of you. \nTHE DOOR BURSTS OPEN, knocking Tolbein, Rain, Rhymer and Nunez on their asses. All eyes bug as Carrigan shoulders his way inside. Only he's n..t Carrigan anymore. Now he's -- \nTHE SCARECROW A golem of dessicated flesh knitted together with straw and sodden burlap, pieces of insects, twine, and razor wire. Button-socket eyes. Jagged bone teeth. Beetle-black chitin for fingers and nails. His very existence is an affront to nature. Everything the Scarecrow touches instantly corrodes and decays. Floorboards rot, metal rusts. Every movement, every spastic shudder and twitch is a source of incalculable pain. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) The Scarecrow thrusts his hand out and a STORM OF DEMONIC CROWS explodes from his chest, whirling about like a cyclone of knives. Now the coyotes enter too. Dozens of them, SNARLING, DIVING at the men, sinking their jaws into flesh. The men are trapped. Some try to flee. Others fight back, swinging chairs and planks -- \nTHE SCARECROW stalks into their midst, snaring victims left and right, HURLING bodies or pulling them apart -- He snatches Viscott up by his throat. Bugs swarm over the SCREAMING parolee's face as it rots and decays. In seconds, Viscott's entire body decomposes, putrefies, falls apart -- \nRHYMER AND RAIN back up towards the kitchen. SCREECH! A crow-thing comes flapping. Rhymer FIRES. The creature SHRIEKS and flops -- Nunez claws another from his face, SEES it's not a crow at all, but some kind of wriggling eyeless monstrosity with a deformed razor beak, matted feathers, bony talons -- Wilson, trapped under a bench, BEATS desperately at a gnashing coyote. Lands a real blow. The beast falls back then stands up like a man? \nVARIOUS ANGLES as the OTHER COYOTES do likewise. The coyotes are changing shape, enlarging, canine skeletons CRACKING and re-arranging themselves into -- \nJAW-BEASTS The same half-glimpsed horrors we glimpsed accompanying Starke. All muscle and gnashing fangs and bloody, ripping claws. \n", "test3_id": 1130}

{"test1_input": "(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (2) \nON THE RIDER Alive. Evil. Aflame. A man but not a man -- an impossible spectre, engulfed in fire, its skullish head deeply bowed. Clinking coils of red-hot chain slip link by link through its skeletal, flickering fingers. Then it lifts his terrible \nHEAD -- \nTHE FACE OF JOHN BLAZE Skeletal, aflame, but somehow still Johnny, his tortured visage recognizable even as the furnace blazes blue-white. His jaw bone pivots open to unleash an INHUMAN HOWL, at once predatory and tormented, a shriek of eternal damnation. Time speeds up again. The men run. The Ghost Rider accelerates from zero to sixty in a heartbeat. Lloyd runs fast as he can. Talk about pointless. The Ghost Rider seizes his head, drags him seventy yards, burning him black, discarding him -- The other men let rip. Guns blaze. BULLETS punch through the Ghost Rider, coming out his back as red hot slag. The demon hauls a deep curve, powers up onto his rear wheel -- \nALBRIGHT What the fuck?! WHAT THE FUCK?! Albright FIRES his shotgun. THUNDERING past like an Amtrak train, the Ghost Rider PUNCHES a flaming fist right through Albright'-, face. That's it for the others. They scramble for the trucks. WHOOSH! The Ghost Rider lashes out with his chains, lassos Chudacoff. He SCREAMS as the metal sears his body, falls heavily, burning -- The Ghost Rider skids to a halt, summons something internal and lets it loose -- a blast of PURE HELLFIRE that courses down the chains and engulfs Chudacoff, immolating him. The men make the trucks, pile in. Landsdale slams the Tundra into drive. The big truck hauls away. Carrigan fights to get the Bronco into gear. Rain peeks out from the back, eyes bugging -- \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (3) \nRAIN'S POV as the Ghost Rider dismounts, stalks through the rain towards them. He raising his skeletal hand, clenches it, and suddenly we are -- \nINSIDE THE BRONCO'S ENGINE A series of MACRO SHOTS as we move amongst the pistons, cylinders, and intake manifolds. The mixture of vaporized fuel and air within the engine begins to ignite, but then the miniature explosions seem to contract and implode in upon themselves and we are -- \nBACK OUTSIDE with Carrigan. His truck won't start. Somehow, the ?host Rider has actin uished the flames within his engine. The Ghost Rider keeps coming, his skeletal claws/fingers white-hot now, throbbing with heat. He slices through the Bronco's door like a human oxy-acetylene torch, chopping the vehicle apart. Carrigan panics, drags Rain out the passenger door. But Fusco is still trapped inside. Can't get his seatbelt off. The Ghost Rider tears open the roof, bisects the vehicle and HURLS the front away, leaving Fusco cowering in the melted back seat. The Ghost Rider looms over Fusco, extending a skeletal claw -- \nFUSCO Oh God, please, I ain't nothing to do with nothin'. I ain't nothin'. Please, \nPLEASE! \nON CARRIGAN tugging Rain away from the horror, trying to ignore Fusco's terrible SCREAMS. He looks back, wishes he hadn't -- The Ghost Rider has Fusco snatched up nose-to-nose, forcing the man to look right into -- \nTHE GHOST RIDER'S EYES Hungry black sockets that suck the fire from the air. \n(CONTINUED) \nCONTINUED: (4) \nFUSCO shudders, eyes bulging. All he can do is stare into those awful pits, fall into them, as grisly IMAGES from his evil past spark and shred into his melting mind. Every act of violence, every crime he ever committed -- beatings, murders, acts of torture and revenge -- are now revisited upon Fusco tenfold. This is the PENANCE STARE, and Fusco is feeling it's full, hellish force. The Ghost Rider and Fusco SCREAM in sync. Carrigan and Rain can't look away. They stand transfixed -- Then it's over. The Ghost Rider drops Fusco into the mud. He lies there, shuddering, glassy-eyed, burned black but still alive, his brain irrevocably overloaded. And The Ghost Rider is somehow different too. Immobile. Internal. Then he looks up, past Carrigan. R;rht at. Rain. Rain stares back. But it's -- \nBLAZE'S FACE she SEES. An abject abyss of pain and shame and torment. And Rain's terror is forgotten for just that moment, replaced with something best described as empathy. \nLIGHT AND NOISE to the Ghost Rider's left. He turns -- the Tundra screams out of nowhere, slamming into him at sixty plus. \nINSIDE THE CAB LANDSDALE ducks the shattering windshield, leaps from the truck as it fills with fire -- The Tundra keeps moving, pile-drives the howling spectre square into a massive boulder. The truck compresses like an accordion, EXPLODES, engulfs the rock with fire -- Landsdale picks himself up, ready for anything. Carrigan tugs Rain over. The wreckage burns out of control. \nCARRIGAN Did you kill it --? \nLANDS DALE Fuck if I know!!! Just then, Nomi's pickup backs into view. Odell is driving. Ca___gan snatches Rain up like baggage, starts forward. \n(CC 1T=N1U D) \nCONTINUED: (5) \nON NOMI dazed, in a muddy gully. She scrambles up to the lip, SEES the burning Tundra nearby, SEES her pickup hauling away into the night. She WAILS, tries to drags herself to her feet -- CREAK. The burning wreckage moves. Moves again. Nomi ducks down, watches, uncomprehending. The crumpled truck is hurled aside. Two tons. Tipped over like a packing crate. Nomi slips down into the gully, gasping with fear. HEAVY FOOTSTEPS and CRACKLING FIRE draw near -- Nomi dares to look up. The Ghost Rider stares down at her. Like Death itself. Imagine yourself face to face with a Great White, an unfathomable, impenetrable force of nature -- Then imagine that force turning away, sparing you. The world exhales. After a moment Nomi dares to look again: \nNOMI'S POV (THROUGH THE POURING RAIN) All she sees is a MAN, in tattered clothes, rolling a busted up motorcycle away into the darkness. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL - TRAUMA WARD - NIGHT \nGraveyard shift but the floor is busy. Too many accidents, too few staff. And the POLICE and PARAMEDICS hovering here and there are just getting in the way. \nON BLAZE, stumbling through the crowded ward, head down, in obvious pain. OR. QUINLAN ( 30s, harried), struggles to keep up, filling out paperwork on the fly. \nQUINLAN Sir, you have to tell me your name. \nBLAZE I just need to sit down for a moment. And I need some forceps, gauze, tape -- \nQUINLAN I'll decide what you need, alright? Name? Blaze hauls a curtain aside, finds an empty surgery bay, prepped and ready to go. \nCONTINUED: SHOUTING MEDICS tear past, pushing a SCREAMING BURN VICTIM on a gurney. Blaze ducks into the curtained bay. Quinlan follows. \nQUINLAN (CONT'D) Sir, I can't help you if you don't cooperate. (beat, pointedly) Are you on something? Drugs? Blaze pulls at his jacket, easing it over his battered body. \n", "test1_true": "QUINLAN \n(TAKEN ABACK) Oh -- my. What happened to you? Blaze sits back on the bed, sets about cleaning his wounds with tools laid out on a tray nearby. \nBLAZE Motorcycle accident. Couple abrasions, maybe some rib fractures -- (Quinlan tries to help) Just step back, I'll handle it -- \nQUINLAN Those are bullet holes. Blaze cleans the wounds she's referring to, grits his teeth as he swabs gauze deep into his flesh. \nBLAZE Nah. They're just -- gouges. Surface damage. They'll heal up fine. Ungh - do you have any -- painkillers? \nQUINLAN (assertive now, plainly \nSUSPICIOUS) This was no motorcycle accident. Somebody has cauterized your wounds Blaze inserts the forceps into a particularly nasty wound. \nBLAZE Percocet? Vicodin, maybe? \nCONTINUED: (2) Blaze pulls a vicious shard of metal out of his side, stifles a SCREAM, fights to keep it together. \nBLAZE (CONT' D) Just. Give. Me. Something. For. The. Pain. He staunches the blood, fixing her with such a stone stare that she involuntarily backs away. \nQUINLAN I'm sorry -- but I need to report this. Stay right there. Quinlan backs out through the curtain. Blaze sighs, tapes a thick gauze patch over the wound, eyes hunting. He SEES a drug cabinet, breaks into it. Fills his pockets. \nINT. HOSPITAL - HALLWAY - NIGHT \nMoments later, Blaze is stumbling away. He pops the cap of a pill bottle, dry-swallows a half-dozen painkillers -- To his right, a PARAMEDIC TEAM works on the shrieking burn victim we saw earlier. Blaze stops, horrified -- It's FUSCO, eyes rolling wildly, charred nearly beyond recognition. Flailing and convulsing, fingers nothing but exposed, blackened bone -- \nON BLAZE, backing into a quiet corner. He suppresses a sob, fumbling a hypodermic as he fills it with stolen morphine. He jabs the spike into his leg, sags as the drug takes effect. After a moment, Blaze calms, gets his bearings, notices that he's leaning against a bulletin board on which is pinned -- \nA WANTED POSTER, helpfully illustrated with a mug-shot of Blaze's own face. Blaze tears the poster down, stuffs it in his pocket, then realizes that SOMEONE is watching him. He turns, SEES -- \nNOMI sitting on a nearby bed. Beaten, bruised, desolate. A PAIR OF STATE TROOPERS are questioning her. She stares past them, straight at Blaze. She recognizes him. \n(ICN-=NU_^) \nCONTINUED: Ice water floods Blaze's veins. He hurries away. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. MAIN STREET - DAY \nBlaze approaches a mailbox, fishes a postcard from his backpack. He writes the date, checks the time on his watch and jots that down too. He addresses it, drops it in the slot. Then he turns around and SEES -- -- Nomi standing behin him, J\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdIorkina his way. \nNOMI You were there last night. \nBLAZE Excuse me? \nNOMI when they took my daughter. \nBLAZE I don't know what you're talking about \nNOMI Yes you do. Blaze tries to pass off his unease with an ill-conjured smile. He pushes past her, moving to his battered motorcycle. Nomi follows. \nNOMI (CONT' D ) The Ghost Rider. It walked right past me. It let me live. (a whisper, intense) I know what you are. Blaze stares at Nomi, shaken. \nBLAZE Lady, you don't know shit. (his tone turning lethal) Now bark the fuck o t of my Ii Blaze mounts his bike, kicks it alive, leaves Nomi in the dust. \nEXT. HIGH PLAINS - DAY \nBlaze heads north under a big sky castled with towering white clouds. \n(CAN'::VL=D1 \nCONTINUED: Prairie grasslands roll away on either side of the two lane blacktop. But Blaze's landscape is deep within and dark, dominated by the thunderheads of last night's horror. He notches the throttle up a little, cruises at ninety. Rolls his head back, lets the wind stream over his face. Then he hears ANOTHER MOTORCYCLE. Blaze looks back -- \nNOMI pulls alongside Blaze, riding a monster bike of her own. Blaze burns away. But Nomi's no slouch. She matches his speed and is back beside him moments later. She SHOUTS: \nNOMI \nPULL OVER! I NEED TO TALK TO YOU! Blaze guns the bike again, jinks around an oncoming station wagon that blares it's HORN_ But Nomi's still on him -- \nNOM I (CONT' D ) \n", "test1_id": 1128, "test2_input": "DAMNIT, I NEED YOUR HELP!!! \nBLAZE \n(IRRITATED) \nLADY, I'VE HELPED YOU ENOUGH! Nomi smiles. Blaze just slipped up and they both know it. \nNOMI \nI THOUGHT THAT WAS THE GHOST RIDER!!! Angry with himself, Blaze throttles his bike to the max, howling over the next rise on his back wheel, probably hitting one-fifteen as he vanishes from view. Nomi skids to a stop on the shoulder and waits, her engine RUMBLING. Wind blows. Lizards click. After a long beat, Blaze reappears. Stops far away on the crest of the rise. Stares at her. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. FOOTHILLS - DUSK \nBlaze and Nomi weave their way through an obstacle course of rusted car hulks and assorted junk, heading for a battered Airstream trailer perched on the edge of a bluff. \n( -_ :N :N\"' 7- D) \nCONTINUED: \nNOMI I knew what you were the moment I saw you. I can help you -- jf you're willing to help mp-. I know things. \nBLAZE Like what? \nNOMI This thing that's riding you, the Ghost Rider. I guess it has a lot of names. But the one I grew up hearing was nagi ocanl sice. It means the Spirit of Vengeance. \nBLAZE You actually believe what you're telling me? \nNOMI You kidding? I'm pure-bred Dakota. I can hear the mountains talking to each other. And I saw you light up those pricks like Chinese New Year last night. They reach the trailer. Nomi fixes glaze with a stare. \nNOMI (CONT ' D ) what do you see when you sleep at night? The dead? The faces of the people you've taken? \nBLAZE \n(ANGRY) J,t takes them. Not me. Nomi nods, not sure she believes him. Enters the trailer. \nINT. AIRSTREAM - DUSK \nDark, shadowy. Curtains drawn tightly shut. Every corner crammed with bric-a-brac. On the TV: the football game. Blaze sits on a collapsing couch. Nomi hovers nearby. Her grandfather HENRI LAFORTE (80s, emphysemic), rambles on in Dakotan, pausing only to suck on his oxygen mask. He keeps his eyes on the game the whole time, never once looking at Blaze. \nBLAZE (aside, to Nomi) Does your grandfather understand English? \n(:\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd,NT=NLE_-) \nCONTINUED: \nNOMI He understands. He just refuses to speak it. Laforte continues to ramble intermittently. Blaze shifts, impatient, finally sits forward. \nBLAZE Listen, I don't want to be an ass-hole, but can we just fast-forward the whole Yoda routine? The home team scores! Laforte WHOOPS wildly, loses his mask, COUGHS uncontrollably. Blaze stands. He's out of there. \nBLAZE (CONT'D) Feel better, old man. \nLAFORTE (rasping, in English) Give me the coin. Blaze stops, cocks an eyebrow at Nomi. She shrugs. Blaze hands over the coin. Laforte studies it, starts speaking in Dakota again. Nomi translates: \nNOMI The man you're looking for goes by lots of names. Coyote, Black Dog. In Dakota, he's Waka Sica. The Trickster. Look at him straight on, you might see a human. Look at him out of the corner of your eye at one of the in-between times -- dusk or dawn, you might see something else. \nBLAZE What does he want? \nLAFORTE Wacokico. Vengeance. \nBLAZE Why? \nNOMI Because it's his nature. Laforte elaborates. Nomi continues to translate. \nNOM I (CONT' D ) Long ago, Coyote could change his shape, chop his body into little pieces, causing all sorts of mischief. \n(MORE) (coNT=NLE\u00ef\u00bf\u00bd) \nCONTINUED: (2) \n", "test2_true": "BLAZE I've been looking for this man for five years now, storm-chasing -- (pulls out his map) Tracked him halfway across the country. How do I make him lift the curse? \nLAFORTE Ta ocanzeke kin akta a'ikoyake. T'e sniya kel rrrani. Takuni a'ikoyake sni ya'un kte hantana, wocanzeke kin ekignaka yo! \nNOMI My grandfather says you've been looking in the wrong place. You need to look inward. The Ghost Rider is Starke's weapon. An extension of his rage. But it can't ride people unless it has something to latch onto in the first place. You understand? Blaze nods. He thinks he does. Laforte hands the coin back, returns his attention to the game. But as Blaze starts to rise, Laforte says one final thing: \nLAFORTE Wee-cha-sha nee-shee-cha hay? Nomi pauses, deciding how to phrase what the old man said. \nBLAZE What? What'd he say? \nNOMI He wants to know if you're a bad man. If the Ghost Rider turned its penance stare on you, would you burn? \nEXT. AIRSTREAM - NIGHT \nDarkness has fallen. The sky glitters infinite black. Blaze joins Nomi at the edge of the bluff. \nBLAZE Why don't you just go to the police? \nNOMI I did. But I'm red. They said they'll \"look into it\". Truth is, I've had a few run-ins with them myself. \nBLAZE Your daughter -- why does Starke want her? Nomi takes a beat, looks away. Haunted, ashamed. \nNOMI Because he's her father. And he wants her back. Billy-Ray and the others, they're being paid to take her to him. Blaze nods. Things are falling into place now. \nNOMI (CONT' D ) Look, I believe things happen for a reason. Call it fate, karma, whatever you want -- but there's no way our paths crossing was just blind luck. I need your help, Blaze. \nBLAZE Just so you understand what you're asking, this thing inside me -- I can't control it. It just comes out. And when it does, it's like I'm a prisoner in my own body. There's no reasoning with it. It doesn't have a conscience. It doesn't even have a personality. It's just a -- \n(SEARCHING) -- hunger. \nNOMI You're looking for Starke. I'm looking for my kid. We find one, we'll find the other. \nBLAZE And then --? \nCONTINUED: \nNOMI \n(POINTEDLY) And then I don't care about the rest. \nCUT TO: \nA POWERFUL DUST STORM Raging full force. Blinding dust and debris batter closing store fronts. Roof sheeting tears away, street lamps rattle, hapless LOCALS struggle to get indoors. A lone coyote lopes through the havoc, trotting purposefully against the wind, dodging cars, ducking flying boards and planks. The animal passes under a sign: \"HOWARDSVILLE CAR \nRENTS\". \nCLOSE ON A MAN'S MOUTH Lupine. Carnivorous. Speaking into a payphone handset. \nMAN Is she comfortable? Are you feeding her properly? \nVOICE \n(FILTERED) She's alright, I guess. Quiet. \nBACK TO THE COYOTE running between rows of rental cars. \nMAN Does she know where you're taking her? \nVOICE I think she's figured it out. \nMAN And how does she feel about that? \nVOICE How the hell should I know? \nEXT. WHEATFIELD - DAWN \nCarrigan paces the edge of a billowing wheatfield, wired to his cell phone. Dawn peeks over the horizon.

One of the windows SLAMS open, startling everyone. Rhymer moves to it, latches it shut again. \nINT. MISSION - ENTRANCE HALL - NIGHT \nLIGHTNING flashes. An eerie HOWLING arises. Tolbein and Nunez lead some men to the front door. Tolbein unbars the door, pulls it open, can't believe his eyes: THREE DOZEN HOWLING COYOTES, approaching the entrance. \nTOLBEIN What is this?! SCARE! A snarling coyote comes out of left field, just misses his throat -- Tolbein leaps backward, SLAMS the door. The men start SHOUTING. Rain backs away. She knows what's happening. WHAM!

He moves to investigate, presses up against a cracked window -- \nRHYMER'S POV (THROUGH WINDOW) Carrigan stands outside, lurching between patterns of moonlight and shadow. But the movement is all wrong. And in our momentary glimpses of him, we get the sense that he's been horribly changed -- as if his body had been torn apart, then haphazardly reassembled into something else. CRUNCH! The wall fractures. Rhymer staggers back. WHUMP! CRUNCH! A row of impacts moves along the wall -- Tolbein and Nunez scramble to reach the dining room door. They close it, turning the locks. WHANG! Carrigan slams against the other side of the heavy, steel door. WHANG!WHANG! Again and again and again. The men are terrified, SHOUTING at each other. The door is buckling inward, the hinges bending and GROANING -- Then the pummelling stops. Just the sound of BREATHING, halting and phlegmatic. No one moves, not a whisper. CORROSION starts to spread across the metal door. \nNUNEZ What the fuck --?! Rhymer edges close to the decaying door, peering through a gap in the frame -- Carrigan peers back, moonlight illuminating his face. There are buttons where his eyes should 12P. He BELLOWS: \nCARRIGAN \nPRIEST! GIVE ME THE GIRL! The POUNDING begins anew, harder now. The weakened door is surely about to give way. Rain is terrified. \nTOLBEIN Do what he says!

Tolbein hesitates -- then grabs at the shotgun. He twists it from Rhymer's hands, SMASHES the butt across Rhymer's jaw. Rhymer sinks to the floor. Tolbein grabs Rain, drags her SCREAMING to the door. He waves the shotgun at the others -- \nTOLBEIN Open the fucking door! DO IT! Nunez fumbles with the lock. Rhymer recovers, throws himself at Nunez, tries stop him from opening it.

All eyes bug as Carrigan shoulders his way inside. Only he's n..t Carrigan anymore. Now he's -- \nTHE SCARECROW A golem of dessicated flesh knitted together with straw and sodden burlap, pieces of insects, twine, and razor wire. Button-socket eyes. Jagged bone teeth.

Others fight back, swinging chairs and planks -- \nTHE SCARECROW stalks into their midst, snaring victims left and right, HURLING bodies or pulling them apart -- He snatches Viscott up by his throat. Bugs swarm over the SCREAMING parolee's face as it rots and decays. In seconds, Viscott's entire body decomposes, putrefies, falls apart -- \nRHYMER AND RAIN back up towards the kitchen. SCREECH! A crow-thing comes flapping. Rhymer FIRES. The creature SHRIEKS and flops -- Nunez claws another from his face, SEES it's not a crow at all, but some kind of wriggling eyeless monstrosity with a deformed razor beak, matted feathers, bony talons -- Wilson, trapped under a bench, BEATS desperately at a gnashing coyote. Lands a real blow. The beast falls back then stands up like a man? \nVARIOUS ANGLES as the OTHER COYOTES do likewise.

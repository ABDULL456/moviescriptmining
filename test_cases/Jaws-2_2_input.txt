SKIPPER You got a gold-plater drifting in the main channel. Big cruiser. 
HENDRICKS Whereabouts? 
SKIPPER Off the Point. No running lights, just a diver's flag. 
HENDRICKS (aside to Brody) Want me to run out there? 
BRODY On your own time? 
HENDRICKS Happy to do it. 
BRODY Then check it out. I'll be in the office. 
Hendricks nods, and starts the engine importantly. 
HENDRICKS Cast off your bow line. And your stern line. Spring line... 
While Red grumbles, Brody and Sean are walking up to the street. 
Michael and some teen-agers are headed down to the dock. 
ANGLE ON BRODY AND THE KIDS 
It's Mike, Polo, Patrick, Lucy, Brooke, Ed and Tina. 
BRODY Where to? 
MIKE No place special. Just hanging out. 
BRODY Sailing? 
Mike nods. 
BRODY Watch your kid brother, huh? 
He gets into his jeep, leaving Sean with the teen-agers. 
BROOKE Bye, Mr. Brody. 
The others ad lib appropriate greetings/good-byes, as Brody drives off in his jeep. 
EXT. DOCKSIDE - DAY 
The Kids busy themselves with their boats while Sean hovers around Mike, who's not happy at baby-sitting his kid brother. 
POLO Anyone want to sail to the lighthouse? 
PATRICK Machs nix to me. 
LUCY Anyone got a spare mooring line? Mine's shot. 
TINA I've got one... 
SEAN Can I go too? 
MIKE No. 
SEAN Please. 
MIKE I said, 'No.' 
Tina's in her boat, "Tina's Joy," a neat sloop. Mike is going over his "Green Machine," a sleek catamaran. 
BROOKE You're not going out right away, are you? 
MIKE Waiting for Andy. 
BROOKE I want you to meet my cousin. 
MIKE I will, I will. 
SEAN I want to go out with you. You need a crew, don't you? 
Before Sean can protest further, Mike spots his crew: Andy Nicholas, a round-faced, frizzy-haired pal, wearing a bathing suit, and carrying some scuba gear from an early-morning diving class. Marge and Denise, two other divers, are with him, with their gear. They ad-lib "good-byes." 
MIKE I don't need you. Andy's here. 
SEAN You always go with Andy. 
MIKE (to Andy) How was dive class? 
ANDY Same as always -- glub-glub, bubble- bubble, stroke-stroke. There sure is some weird shit on the bottom of the ocean. 
BROOKE Shells and lobsters and stuff? 
ANDY Mostly old garbage. Today we found a '48 Hudson. 
SEAN Do I have to play with the little kids? 
MIKE Yeah. Go on, beat it. 
Sean mopes away while Andy and Mike get their boat ready for sea. 
FOLLOW SEAN OFF THE DOCK 
Up on the street, where a pretty girl with a sexy face and a provocative post-pubescent walk is asking him directions. 
He points down at the dock. The Girl, Jackie Peters, waves at her cousin, Brooke. 
JACKIE Brooke! Hey! 
One of the boats has a portable radio going. It's playing some medium-hot salsa. Jackie does a couple of dance steps on her way down the dock. 
CLOSE ON ANDY AND MIKE 
ANDY Who's that? Quick -- I'm in love. 
MIKE I hope that's the cousin.

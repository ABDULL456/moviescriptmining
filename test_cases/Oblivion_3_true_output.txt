(CLASPING HIS 
SHOULDERS) But you can, repairman. That is the beautiful irony. It gave you the skills. 
ON JACK... 
EXT. RAVEN ROCK - CONTINUOUS 
The ROVER crawls up the Canyon finally arrive at the entrance to Raven Rock. It stops, scanning the face of Raven Rock... BLAMI!! A SHOT hits it, it tumbles back, utterly destroyed. 
INT. SKY TOWER, CONTROL STATION - CONTINUOUS 
Victoria is working hard, intent on deciphering the sound. She doesn't notice the image of Raven Rock appear on a side monitor, transmitted from the ROVER. 
INT. WORK HANGER - CONTINUOUS 
Suddenly, SYKES and several other Scavs burst into the area. All eyes go to Jack and Julia as the ruined ROVER is brought in. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SYKES It followed him here. I told you this was a mistake! Beech, processing. All around the periphery, REACTION. This is a disaster. 
BEECH Well well, we may be out of time. Set the Drone to return to the Tet upon reactivation. It needs to go right to the center -- 
JACK No! It will kill - 
BEECH 
(RAGING) It will kill that ugly stain on the sky. That's all! Now program the Drone! Soldiers push Jack towards the opened Drone. Jack stares at the read-outs, the electronics. Sykes GRABS a weapon from a female Scav soldier, lines it on Jack. 
JACK No. I won't do it. 
SYKES He won't help us. We bury them both, make our run as soon as we can load up. 
JULIA 
NO!! Jack stares Sykes down. 
JACK You know I stare into weapons every day, so you can put that away. Because here's what I can tell you... (back to Beech) If the Rover found us, the Drones will too. Unless you want them to find you, let me get somewhere where I can send a signal. Somewhere far from here. Beech... caught. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: ( 2) 
BEECH 
(IGNORING SYKES) What's your plan, Jack? Tell the Tet where we are, so they can send a nice big welcome -- 
JACK The Drones would kill you. Let me try to stop that. 
SYKES You can't trust him! 
JACK (staying on Beech) You're wasting time. On Beech, Sykes... 
TNT. RAVEN ROCK - MOMENTS LATER Jack and Julia stand near the entrance to Raven Rock. Sykes appears with the white rectangular box, tosses it down in the dirt at Jack's feet. Beech watches as Jack unfolds his motorcycle. Behind them, other Scavs are packing up, readying an exodus.

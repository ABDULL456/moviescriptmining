{"train": "\"Batman\", early draft, by Sam Hamm \nBATMAN \nScreenplay by \nSam Hamm \nBased on the Character Created by \nBob Kane \nFIRST DRAFT \nOctober 20, 1986 \nFADE IN: \nEXT. CITYSCAPE - NIGHT \nThe place is Gotham City. The time, 1987 -- once removed. \nThe city of Tomorrow: stark angles, creeping shadows, dense, crowded, airless, a random tangle of steel and concrete, self-generating, almost subterranean in its aspect... as if hell had erupted through the sidewalks and kept on growing. A dangling fat moon shines overhead, ready to burst. \nEXT. CATHEDRAL - NIGHT \nAmid the chrome and glass sits a dark and ornate Gothic anomaly: old City Cathedral, once grand, now abandoned -- long since boarded up and scheduled for demolition. \nOn the rooftop far above us, STONE GARGOYLES gaze down from their shadowy, windswept perches, keeping monstrous watch over the distant streets below, sightless guardians of the Gotham night. \nOne of them is moving. \nEXT. GOTHAM SQUARE - NIGHT \nThe pulsing heart of downtown Gotham, a neon nightmare of big-city corruption, almost surreal in its oppressiveness. Hookers wave to drug dealers. Street hustlers slap high- fives with three-card monte dealers. They all seem to know each other... with one conspicuous exception: \nA TOURIST FAMILY, Mom, Dad, and little Jimmy, staring straight  ahead as they march in perfect lockstep down the main drag. They've just come out of a bit show two blocks over; the respectable theatre crowd has thinned out, and now -- Playbills in hand -- they find themselves adrift in the predatory traffic of Gotham's meanest street. \nMOM For God's sake, Harold, can we please just get a taxi?? \nDAD I'm trying to get a -- (shouting) TAXI!! \nThree cabs streak pass and disappear. MOM grimaces in frustration as LITTLE JIMMY consults a subway map. \nJIMMY We're going the wrong way. \nNearby, STREET TYPES are beginning to snicker. DAD surveys them nervously, gestures toward the subway map. \nDAD Put that away. We'll look like tourists. \nTWO COPS lean on their patrol car outside an all-night souvlaki stand, sipping coffee and chatting with a HOOKER. The HOOKER smiles at JIMMY.  JIMMY smiles back. MOM yanks him off down the street and glowers at DAD. \nDAD (cont.) We'll never get a cab here. Let's cut over to Seventh. \nJIMMY Seventh is that way. \nDAD I know where we are! \nEXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nA deserted access street, sidewalks lined with the husks of stripped-down cars. MOM, DAD, and JIMMY take a deep breath and march down the darkened street. A VOICE startles them. \nVOICE Hey, mister. Gimme a dollar? \nThe VOICE belongs to a DERELICT -- nineteen or twenty, acne-scarred -- who sits between two garbage cans, his palm uplifted. His ratty t-shirt reads: 'I LOVE GOTHAM CITY.' \nMOM, DAD, and JIMMY pause for the merest of seconds, then move on -- pretending not to hear. \nDERELICT Mister. How about it. One dollar? (standing up) One dollar, man. Are you deaf? Are you deaf? -- Do you speak English?? \nBy now the TOURISTS are halfway across the street. Mercifully, the DERELICT doesn't seem to be following. \nThey pick up their pace. They don't see the SHADOWY FIGURE in the alleyway. They don't see the GUN until a gloved hand brings it down, butt-first, across the back of DAD's neck. \nDAD crumples. MOM grabs JIMMY and backs up against a brick wall, too terrified to scream. The DERELICT races across the street to join his confederate, the STREET PUNK, who's already searching for DAD's wallet. \nMOM's mouth opens in panic. They can see she's about to snap -- so  the STREET PUNK, still in a crouch, trains his gun on JIMMY. \nSTREET PUNK Do the kid a favor, lady. Don't scream. \nThe poor woman is utterly horrified. TEARS stream down her face. But she keeps her wits about her, stifles the urge to shriek, and hustles JIMMY off down the street. \nThe two PUNKS watch them break into a run -- then chuckle, slap hands, race off in the opposite direction. \nEXT. ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nSix stories up. The PUNKS -- NICK and EDDIE -- hunker down on the tar-and-gravel roof, sizing up their take. \nNICK (emptying the wallet) All right. The Gold Card. (tossing the credit card in EDDIE's face) Don't leave home without it. \nA chill wind whips across the roof as NICK extracts the cash and begins to count it. There's a distant, indistinct CLANG: metal on metal. EDDIE hears it and tenses up. \nEDDIE Let's beat it, man. I don't like being up here. \nNICK What, scared of heights? \nCivic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery. They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're going to enjoy this. \nTuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING -- the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up. \nThe engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE. \nANGLE ON DENT \nDENT If elected, my first act as district attorney will be to return an indictment against Boss Carl Grissom! \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves. Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place reeks of money. \nIn the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured. Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle with extraordinary finesse. \nIn the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech. \nDENT (on the TV screen) Together we can make Gotham city a safe place for decent people to live and work and play. \nTHE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the middle. \nJACK NAPIER Decent people shouldn't live here. They'd be much happier someplace else. \nJACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his appearance. He is also absolutely merciless. \nHe trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides over in her negligee and snuggles up. \nALICIA Anything new? \nJACK The usual gas. If this clown could lay a hand on Grissom... I would've had to kill him by now. \nALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She begins knotting it playfully about his neck. \nALICIA If Grissom knew about us... he might kill you. \nJACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a nearby vanity. \nJACK Don't think so, angel. I'm too valuable. That's the way I've planned it. (pause) And besides, he doesn't know. \nJACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble. \nALICIA You look just fine, Jack. \nHe smiles at himself before turning to the door. \nJACK ... I didn't ask. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT \nThe scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van. \nEDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic. Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE MEDIC. \nMEDIC That one there won't say a word. The other one's raving his head off. \nECKHARDT Variety, huh? The spice of life. \nAt the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX -- thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed PATROLMAN. \nPATROLMAN They found him hugging a drainpipe. He was scared to come off the roof. \nKNOX Great, but tell me: is this another you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's the third one this week. \nPATROLMAN (testily) I dunno. What's \"what\"? \nKNOX Good answer. I'm gonna put you in for a commendation. \nKNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath. \nECKHARDT Oh Christ, it's Knox. \nKNOX Hiya, gents. This anything I should know about? \nECKHARDT Nothing out of the routine. \nAt this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain- fried NICK past the mouth of the alley. \nNICK A bat, I tell you, a giant bat! He wanted me to do him a favor...! \nKNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade disgusted looks. \nKNOX No offense, boys, but these guys are seeing something up there. \nECKHARDT No comment. Print what you like. \nKNOX Come on. One question. Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City? \nKNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him: \nKNOX (cont.) If so, is he on the police payroll? If so, what's he pulling down after taxes? \nVICKI Nothing I'm at liberty to reveal here. What's new and hot in Gotham City? \nKNOX It's too good, Vick. We got a six- foot bat that swoops out of the night and preys on evildoers. \nVICKI (laughing) Evildoers, huh? Big or small? \nKNOX Small so far. I mean -- they don't allow bats in boardrooms, do they. \nVICKI Speaking of which... I hear the notorious Bruce Wayne is throwing a big do for the Harvey Dent campaign. \nKNOX Yeah. Hottest ticket in town. Every law'n'order freak in the city's gonna be there. \nKNOX suddenly freezes. It's just occurred to him that VICKI may have a purpose in all this. \nKNOX (cont.) Wa-a-it. Vicki. You're not saying -- \nShe reaches back into her camera bag and hands over an INVITATION. KNOX is all but panting with excitement. \nKNOX (cont.) Aw, Vicki. Vicki! (apprehensively) Got a date? \nShe flutters her great big eyelashes, shakes her head no. KNOX grabs her face and plants a kiss on her forehead, nearly knocking her out of the swivel chair. \nKNOX (cont.) Vicki, baby, I love you, I've always loved you. Will you marry me? \nVICKI (straightening her clothes) No. \nKNOX Well, I'm starving. Will you at least buy me a hamburger? \nVICKI Yes, but please -- be gentle. \nOverwhelmed with glee, he offers her his arm. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PENTHOUSE - DAY \nA HUGE PLATE GLASS WINDOW opens on the best view in Gotham. This spectacular penthouse suite is just one of the power perks available to CARL GRISSOM, kingpin of the Gotham City rackets, fat, fifty, and utterly without charm. \nGRISSOM, behind a big broad desk, addresses his LIEUTENANTS -- a fearsome assemblage of bloodless white-collar types and few outright goons, sprawled in chairs throughout this makeshift 'boardroom.'  The big boss waves a copy of the Gotham Globe -- with HARVEY DENT's face on the cover. \nGRISSOM Nine points ahead in the new poll. I don't like the way this is shaping up. \nJACK NAPIER slouches in an easy chair off to GRISSOM's right, doing his trademark one-handed shuffle. \nJACK We can always pop him. -- Or pop someone close to him. \nLIEUTENANT Let's feed him to the bat. \nThis suggestion draws CHUCKLES from several members of the crowd. GRISSOM is unamused. \nGRISSOM He's going after our front companies. Specifically Ace Chemical. Which would tie us in with Councilman Kane, Senator Miller... on up the line. (pause) We have to clean out our files before the subpoena comes down. \nLIEUTENANT How do we go? The usual fire? \nGRISSOM I'm thinking break-in. Trash the office, remove the relevant documents... \nJACK \"Industrial espionage.\" \nGRISSOM That's right. And Jack -- (pause) I'd like you to handle this operation personally. \nJACK has just turned up the third ace off the top of the deck. His hand freezes in midair. \nJACK ... Me? \nAt this exact moment, METAL DOORS slide back -- and ALICIA HUNT steps out of GRISSOM's private penthouse elevator. She's carrying a handful of SHOPPING BAGS. \nGRISSOM Hello, sweetheart. I wonder if you'd mind waiting in the other room. \nALICIA's gaze meets JACK's as she vanishes through a side door. The eye contact is not lost on GRISSOM. \nJACK Why do you need me to handle a simple break-in? \nGRISSOM (emphatically) Because I want someone I can trust. \nJACK bridles, but doesn't protest. Nervously, he turns the fourth card off the top of the deck. It's not an ace. \nIt's a JOKER -- a Joker with a neat, round, .22 calibre HOLE through its face. \nGRISSOM (cont.) We'll work out the details later. But it's got to be soon. -- All right, that's all for now. \nGRISSOM'S CRONIES get up to go. JACK, troubled, lingers behind a moment. \nGRISSOM (cont.) You don't mind, do you Jack? It's an important job. I can't trust it to somebody who'll screw up. \nJACK I understand. \nGRISSOM (smiling) Jack. Don't forget your lucky deck. \nJACK pockets the deck and leaves. GRISSOM sits behind the big desk and GRINS WOLFISHLY. \nGRISSOM (cont.) My friend, your luck is just about to change. \nHe reaches for the phone. ALICIA appears in the doorway nearby, modeling her new purchases for him. He smiles coolly at her as he speaks into the receiver. \nGRISSOM (cont.) Get me Lieutenant Eckhardt. \nKNOX (cont.) This guy has just gotten interesting. What else do you know? \nVICKI Just what I've heard. Rich. Reclusive. Old money and lots of it. \nKNOX Likes to kill? \nVICKI (smiling) Women find him magnetic. \nKNOX I bet they like him for his big charity balls. \nVICKI That, and the sweet smell of two hundred million bucks. \nKNOX Well, you know me. The more they've got, the less they're worth. (scanning the room) This guy must be the most worthless man in America. \nJust then, A VOICE FROM BEHIND intrudes. \nBRUCE WAYNE You disappoint me. Why not the world? \nKNOX turns. We get our first good look at the smiling face of BRUCE WAYNE: 32, tall, athletic, impeccably mannered... and intensely handsome. \nKNOX I assume in my usual charming manner I've just insulted the host. (extending a hand) Alexander Knox. \nBRUCE Bruce Wayne. -- I've read your work. I quite like it. \nKNOX Great. Give me a grant. \nBRUCE I might consider it if you introduce me to Miss Vale. \nKNOX blinks at VICKI. BRUCE already seems to know who she is. KNOX shrugs and forges bravely ahead: \nKNOX \"This is Miss Vale.\" -- That felt redundant. \nBRUCE (to VICKI) You're just back from Corto Maltese. I saw your combat photos. Quite a departure for you. \nVICKI That's intriguing. They haven't been published yet. \nBRUCE smiles and ignores the implied question. \nBRUCE ... You have an extraordinary eye. \nHe's laying on the charm now. KNOX, his territorial instincts aroused, pipes up: \nKNOX Some people think she has two. \nVICKI shoots KNOX a sidelong glance: \nVICKI Don't mind my friend. He's a little nervous tonight. \nKNOX, chastened, calls off the dogs and sizes up his competition. BRUCE is charming, all right, but there's something formal, maybe even calculating about it -- he could be reading his clever remarks off cue cards. It's almost as though he's an actor doing a brilliant imitation of charm. \nThis is a man who thinks three moves ahead. KNOX doesn't like him. But VICKI -- who's used to seeing male charm turned on and off, at will -- doesn't seem to mind at all: \nVICKI (cont.) This is an amazing house. I'd love to shoot it sometime. \nBRUCE I don't... seek publicity. -- Will you be staying in Gotham for a while? \nVICKI As far as I know. \nBRUCE Good. Then with any luck we'll run into each other. \nSuddenly ALFRED, the butler, appears in the doorway behind them. He clears his throat. BRUCE turns. \nALFRED Excuse me, sir. Commissioner Gordon was compelled to leave -- very unexpectedly. He asked me to convey his regrets. \nBRUCE Thank you, Alfred. (to VICKI) I hope you'll excuse me. It was a great pleasure meeting you. (to KNOX) And you. \nWithout bothering to shake hands BRUCE does a sharp 180 and strides hurriedly out of the room. \nKNOX I know the rich are different, but that guy is real different. \nVICKI, staring off after BRUCE, doesn't seem to hear him. \nKNOX (cont.) Hello? Vicki? \nVICKI Oh. Sorry. I was thinking. \nKNOX What were you thinking? \nVICKI Yum, yum. \nKNOX Well, he must like the way he looks. He's got a mirror in every room. \nAnd indeed, the two of them are standing before an enormous WALL MIRROR, eight feet wide, running from floor to ceiling. \nVICKI I get it. Bruce Vain. \nShe pokes KNOX. He groans at the dumb pun. And suddenly we \nCUT TO: \nREVERSE ANGLE - THROUGH THE MIRROR \nlooking DOWN ON KNOX and VICKI -- THROUGH ONE-WAY GLASS -- as they continue to chat. Behind the mirror... recording everything that happens in the room... is a small, silent, state-of-the-art SURVEILLANCE CAMERA. \nCLOSEUP - VIDEO MONITOR \nBLASTING AWAY, HOODS III and IV scuttle across the elevated walkways, keeping down, avoiding police fire. One of them starts up a vertical ladder leading to the next catwalk up. \nBATMAN plunges past on the end of a rope. A BLACK-GLOVED HAND snatches at HOOD III's collar as he climbs and YANKS HIM CLEANLY OFF THE LADDER. They drop to the lower catwalk. \nHOOD IV gapes. He LEVELS HIS GUN at BATMAN, who stands his ground, holding onto the rails of the catwalk for support. A bullet hits him squarely in the chest. He does not fall. \nHOOD IV turns and scrambles. BATMAN goes to his belt for a miniature SPEAR GUN. He points it at HOOD IV and FIRES... planting a BARBED HOOK in the HOOD'S LEG. \nANGLE ON COPS \nstaring up in utter disbelief at the action on the catwalk. \nCOP LOOK! \nGORDON My God... it's him. \nANGLE ON CATWALK \nHOOD III, on his feet now, charges BATMAN from behind. BATMAN -- not even turning to face him -- DROPS HOOD III with an ELBOW. Now he has a HOOD on either side. \nHe takes a STEEL BILLY CLUB from his belt, whips it once through the air. It telescopes out into a FOUR-FOOT STAFF. \nLike a drum majorette from hell, he WHIRLS THE STAFF as the HOODS CONVERGE on him. HOOD III takes a debilitating JAB UNDER THE JAW. BATMAN SPINS on his heels and SLAMS THE STAFF into HOOD IV's BACK -- knocking him OFF THE CATWALK to the factory floor forty feet below! \nINT. ACE LOADING BAY - THAT MOMENT \nJACK spots a possible out. He hits a button on the wall; STEEL DOORS RISE to reveal ACE CARGO TRUCKS in the parking lot outside. Beyond the trucks... AN ARMY OF COPS waiting for JACK to make his move. \nNo go. He turns. Behind him, other cops -- the inside team -- are rushing at him in full riot gear. JACK ducks behind a forklift and darts into the adjacent room. \nINT. CHEMICAL SUPPLY ROOM - A MOMENT LATER \nJACK sprints through the room, firing FOUR SHOTS at the metal CHEMICAL TANKS on the wall. TOXIC CHEMICALS gush out onto the floor in streams. The streams run together... begin to SMOKE and SIZZLE. \nCOPS RIGHT BEHIND HIM. JACK can't resist taking one last pot-shot at a FIFTH CHEMICAL TANK. \nAN EXPLOSION knocks him off his feet. \nINT. FACTORY FLOOR - A MOMENT LATER \nCOPS LOOK ON IN PUZZLEMENT as a RIVER OF CHEMICALS courses out into the main refinery. A second later, they go UP IN FLAMES. A WALL OF FIRE bisects the factory floor. \nJACK RACES ALONG behind the spreading wall of flame. The cops can't see him now. He ducks behind a huge machine, hits a switch -- and SLUICE GATES OPEN. CHEMICAL SLUDGE begins to churn. A big HOLE IN THE WALL appears as a gate opens on the East River. It's the waste dump! \nUp on the catwalk, BATMAN has a perfect view of JACK. If JACK can just sprint through the flames without getting shot, he'll make it to the river. BATMAN hooks a rope to his Batarang, FLINGS IT at a catwalk across the floor. \nJACK bolts. BURSTS THROUGH the wall of fire. And just as he does -- \nBATMAN leaps off the catwalk and swings down toward him! His foot catches a THIRTY-FOOT ROLL of plastic, six feet in diameter, one of several standing upright on the floor. The plastic roll DROPS into JACK's path, BLOCKING HIS EXIT. \nAn instant later, BATMAN lands on top of JACK. Wraps an arm around his throat and RAISES his free hand. DRUG-TIPPED STEEL TALONS appear. But before he can paralyze JACK... \nVOICE HOLD IT! \nIn all the ruckus, HOOD V has managed to circle back behind the heavy machinery. Now he's got a GUN pointed DIRECTLY AT COMMISSIONER GORDON'S HEAD. \nHOOD V Let him go or I'll do it. \nBATMAN releases JACK and stands back. JACK chuckles to himself: what loyalty. Then, with plenty of time, he strolls across the floor to a Jacob's ladder mounted on the back wall... and BEGINS TO CLIMB toward the catwalks. \nAll action stops. BATMAN doesn't move. The COPS don't move. HOOD V stands there sweating, his gun hand shaking as he waits for JACK to climb safely out of shooting range. \nECKHARDT's pig-like eyes glisten. His hand drops to his side. He's half-tempted to pull a gun and get the Commissioner plugged. \nANGLE ON JACK \nat a crouch, groping his way along the rail of the catwalk. He reaches a paneled glass window propped open by a supporting rod. It's a forty-foot drop to the swirling black currents of the East River... and freedom. \nHe's about to climb out when his eye falls on a .38 AUTOMATIC -- which lies, abandoned, on the gridwork floor of the catwalk mere yards away. \nANGLE ON FACTORY FLOOR \nThe HOOD, one arm around GORDON. With his gun at the Commissioner's temple, he backs slowly toward the door. \nHOOD V Nobody makes a move. We go out clean. \nJACK'S VOICE ECKHARDT!! \nALL EYES TURN to the catwalk overhead, where JACK stands poised with the .38 in his fist. A SINGLE SHOT drops ECKHARDT cleanly. \nThe moment's distraction is all BATMAN needs. He hurls a NINJA WHEEL -- a small, ratcheted, razor-sharp disc -- at the FOREARM of HOOD V. One jerk of a thin filament WIRE -- a sudden SHRIEK -- and GORDON IS FREE. \nThe THUG lurches forward. His GUN DROPS to the floor, DISCHARGING ACCIDENTALLY. \nAN UNGODLY HOWL OF PAIN echoes out from the catwalk above. JACK REELS and STAGGERS, his hands CLUTCHING AT HIS CHEEKS. BLOOD GUSHES from between his fingers. \nJACK NAPIER HAS BEEN SHOT THROUGH THE FACE. \nA YOUNG COP, unnerved by the sight of JACK's agonized pirouette, draws his gun and OPENS FIRE. \nGORDON NO!! \nBut the bullet has caught JACK in the arm. He spins, totters to the edge of the catwalk... and TOPPLES OVER. The COPS look on helplessly as JACK plunges TWO STORIES DOWN into a CATCH BASIN full of BUBBLING TOXIC WASTE, SCREAMING ALL THE WAY. \nGORDON (cont.) Goddammit, we had him. We -- \nGRISSOM Jack, listen -- we'll cut a deal -- \nJACK JACK? JACK? DO I LOOK LIKE A JACK?? \nAnd now, for the first time, he flings away the hat. RIPS THE MUFFLER from his face. And -- as GRISSOM gasps in shock -- STANDS REVEALED in his full horrendous glory. \nHis flesh is bleached bone-white. His hair is a luminous seaweed-green. And his cheeks are torn and puckered from the bullet wound, TWISTING HIS MOUTH INTO A HIDEOUS, PERPETUAL HARLEQUIN'S GRIN. \nJACK (cont.) I'm not a Jack any more. (pause; cackling) You made me a Joker! \nTHE CACKLE BUILDS INTO FURIOUS, HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER. GRISSOM, revulsed, terrified, pushes himself away from the desk, back toward the window which overlooks the city. \nGRISSOM Jack -- I'm warning you. WIPE THAT LUNATIC GRIN OFF YOUR FACE. \nJACK HA! That's the best part. I CAN'T!! \nAnd with that JACK pulls the trigger. And fires. And fires again until the CLIP IS EMPTY. \nEXT. GRISSOM'S BUILDING - NIGHT \nWe TILT UP the chrome-and-glass facade of the skyscraper, arriving finally at the TOP FLOOR: a PLATE GLASS WINDOW spiderwebbed with cracks where Jack's bullets hit. \nINT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe room is still dark. JACK -- or, as we'll know him from this moment on, THE JOKER -- sits in GRISSOM's swivel chair, staring out at the moon-drenched skyline. \nJOKER What a view. Our little city. It always brings a smile to my face. \nHe reaches for a nearby glass of liquor and glances down at GRISSOM -- who lies dead on the floor, the towel still wrapped around him. THE JOKER laughs softly to himself. \nJOKER (cont.) Guess it's my little city now. Wonder what it'll look like when I get done with it. (pause) I bet it'll be something real fine. Real fine and pretty. \nDISSOLVE T0: \nINT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - MORNING \nThe sun is just up, and VICKI finds herself alone in bed. A SOFT, OFF-KEY BARITONE VOICE drifts out of the adjacent bathroom: BRUCE in the shower, singing \"Honeysuckle Rose.\" \nShe breaks into a huge smile and climbs out of bed. Somehow she's wound up wearing BRUCE's ribbed formal shirt. \nINT. BATHROOM - A MOMENT LATER - MORNING \nBRUCE in his opulent deco shower stall, still SINGING to himself. VICKI sneaks up behind him, opens the door. He instantly STOPS SINGING -- as if he's been hit by a brick. \nVICKI I didn't mean to scare you. I just had to come in here and see it that was really you singing. \nShe smiles, teasing him. He doesn't respond. He acts as if she's caught him doing something shameful -- exposed him. \nVICKI (cont.) (singing) \"Don't buy sugar -- you just have to touch my cup.\" Come on. \"You're my sugar --\" (no response from BRUCE) Bruce, you are such a case. \nBRUCE seems somehow unable to sing along. But be quickly recovers his composure -- and forces a crooked, almost childish smile. \nBRUCE I don't sing very well. \nVICKI Then there's one thing in the world you don't do very well. And I know what it is. -- Now you'll have to kill me. \nHe kisses her good morning, steps out and reaches for a towel. His body is one big mass of BRUISES AND ABRASIONS. \nVICKI (cont.) Poor thing. You should stay off that horse. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY \nKNOX, in a surly mood, examines the morning edition of the Globe. He's turned to page six -- the gossip page -- and there, under Miranda Reitz's byline, is a picture of VICKI. It seems she and BRUCE are the talk of the town. \nKNOX (disgusted) ...Peanut. \nA COPY BOY approaches his desk with a MANILA FOLDER: \nCOPY BOY Here's that morgue file you wanted. \nKNOX leans back in his chair. The file is labelled \"BRUCE WAYNE: 1982-1987.\"  KNOX opens it and begins to leaf through old clippings from back issues of the Globe. \nWAYNE FOUNDATION TO FUND LOW-COST HOUSING. MILLIONAIRE HEADS CHARITY DRIVE FOR GOTHAM HANDICAPPED. HURRICANE VICTIMS SAY 'THANK YOU' TO BRUCE WAYNE. KNOX's face sags in dismay. Every article seems to be telling us just how swell a rich philanthropist can be. \nKNOX Come on. Gimme some dirt! \nThen he notices something odd. In the whole fat file of clippings, there are no pictures of Bruce Wayne -- with two partial exceptions. \nOne is a group shot, Bruce in the middle, waving at the camera and blocking our view of his face. The other is an ancient picture of a collegiate Bruce, stern-faced, hair down to his collar. The caption reads \"BRUCE WAYNE IN 1973\" -- years out of date even when it ran in the paper. \nKNOX (cont.) ... Why don't you like your picture taken? \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT LOBBY - NIGHT \nA DOORMAN DOZES in the plush lobby of ALICIA HUNT's apartment building on the East Side of Gotham. Through the glass doors we see ALICIA outside in the chill wind, peering inside, hesitant to enter. \nAs silently as possible she uses her key and steps in, tiptoeing past the doorman, trying not to wake him. She's almost made it when he SITS BOLT UPRIGHT, startling her. \nDOORMAN Miss Hunt! (smiling) No need to sneak in. The rent's been taken care of. \nALICIA ... The rent? Paid? \nON BRUCE AND VICKI \nA PAINTED STREET MIME walks alongside them, feeling his way along an imaginary wall. VICKI groans. \nVICKI All street mimes should be executed. \nBRUCE ... Looks like a convention. \nAnd indeed, there are HALF A DOZEN STREET MIMES converging on the center of the plaza. \nRICORSO and co. approach the mirrored-glass entrance of a skyscraper. In the lobby, A MIME -- who's been annoying the passersby -- THROWS A BOLT, LOCKING THE DOORS from inside. \nA BODYGUARD bangs on the glass. Nearby, ANOTHER MIME reaches into a trash bin -- and pulls out a MACHINE GUN. \nSUDDEN SCREAMS OF TERROR from the onlookers. \nVICKI turns to BRUCE. Before she can get his name out, he's HOISTED HER BODILY and THROWN HER behind a marble fountain. \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nBRUCE'S EYES darting birdlike around the plaza -- INTERCUT with the following POV SHOTS, ALL IN SLOW MOTION: \n-    TWO MIMES with machine guns. One of them lining PHILLY and co. up against the glass doors, the other holding the CROWD at bay; \n-    A WOMAN in the crowd fainting. A THIRD MIME gleefully imitating her swoon, to no one's amusement; \n-    PHILLY and his goons, COWERING, hands in the air, as OTHER MIMES cruelly mimic their terrified poses... \n... and suddenly BRUCE is RUNNING FRANTICALLY, looking for a secluded spot, an alleyway, anything. No go. He's out in the open, with onlookers everywhere. In his civvies, he's just another citizen... TOTALLY IMPOTENT. \nHe darts around a corner, backs against a wall. WOMEN, CHILDREN, GROWN MEN race past. No privacy. He's practically quaking now, in the throes of some terrible anxiety. He looks up at the sky overhead, terrified. \nA BRILLIANT SUN bears down on him as MACHINE GUNS CHATTER. \nANGLE ON PHILLY AND BODYGUARDS \nBODIES JERKING as GLASS rains down in shards. \nANGLE ON BRUCE \nhis back arched, his mouth agape, his face drained of blood as the sounds of carnage echo through the plaza. It's almost as if the bullets are striking him. \nA moment later, it's all over but the screaming. VICKI emerges from the crowd and finds BRUCE slumped against the wall, nearly catatonic. She moves to touch him. \nAs if by reflex he reaches out and GRABS HER BY THE ARMS -- with a grip so strong it could crush bone. She GASPS, looks up -- and sees, in his traumatized EYES, a look so raw, so desperate, that it virtually defies comprehension. \nVICKI BRUCE!! \nHe blinks rapidly. He relaxes his grip. Before VICKI's eyes, he's changing... becoming the BRUCE she knows. \nBRUCE Oh my God... are you all right? \nHe reaches for her. Involuntarily, she steps back. \nHe sees her reaction and his face goes slack -- frightened, pleading. This time she lets him embrace her... but her face is full of bewilderment and doubt. \nINSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN \nANCHORWOMAN ... live from Halliday Plaza, where a gangland-style execution claimed the life of racketeer Philly Ricorso. Ricorso's death is the third in a rash of underworld killings... \nCUT TO TWO-SHOT: the ANCHORWOMAN and COMMISSIONER GORDON. \nANCHORWOMAN (cont.) Commissioner, you've heard the rumors. Are these murders the work of the mysterious 'Batman'? \nA PIERCING CACKLE fills the air. CAMERA PULLS BACK from the TV, placing us in the JOKER's boardroom. Behind the big desk he SWIVELS INTO VIEW, phone in hand. \nJOKER All reet! I think it's about time we called another meeting, huh? \nCUT TO: \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY \nALFRED on the phone, a feather duster in his hand. \nALFRED I'm sorry, Miss Vale. I've given him your messages. That's all I can do. \nANGLE WIDENS. BRUCE is sitting mere feet away, obviously distraught, locked in some sort of internal struggle. \nINT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT - DAY \nVICKI Please tell him... I'm not trying to make his life difficult. I'd just -- I'd just like to know what's going on. \nA KNOCK at the door as VICKI hangs up. She goes to open it, finds KNOX -- wearing a big, cheshire-cat smile. \nKNOX Hiya, peanut. I got something I'd like you to see. \nINT. LIBRARY - DAY \nA MICROFILM MACHINE. As VICKI looks on curiously, KNOX -- all eagerness now -- threads up a roll of film and begins cranking through back-issue newspapers. \nKNOX Okay, here we go. Check it out. \nHe steps back. VICKI stares down at the display screen. A FRONT-PAGE BANNER HEADLINE reads: \nTHOMAS WAYNE MURDERED Prominent Doctor, Wife Slain in Robbery Unidentified Gunman Leaves Child Unharmed \nShe hears a strange HISSING NOISE. A few feet away, GREEN SMOKE is billowing out of an air-conditioning vent. \nTRAYS OF FOOD CRASH TO THE FLOOR as WAITERS pass out. ART LOVERS drop forks, go face down in their pasta salad. \nVICKI hurriedly fits the gas mask over her nose and mouth. Within seconds, she's the only one conscious in the room. \nINT. MUSEUM - THAT MOMENT \nGREEN SMOKE plumes up toward the ceiling as we TILT DOWN toward the floor of the atrium. PATRONS and SECURITY GUARDS lie sprawled on the floor, twisted at odd angles, out cold. \nThe mist is beginning to clear now. The doors swing open and in strolls THE JOKER, looking quite dapper in his street makeup and BIG PURPLE PIMP'S HAT. \nA SQUAD OF GOONS enters behind him. Some of them are carrying large cartons. They lock the entry doors, place a \"CLOSED\" sign in front of them, and begin uncrating LARGE CANS OF BLACK PAINT. \nThe JOKER steps up onto the ramp, examines the artwork with an appreciative eye. \nJOKER Okay, boys, let's broaden our minds. \nHe stops in front of an Ingres odalisque. Stands back a pace or two to get a better look. Then pulls out a STRAIGHT RAZOR and cuts a LONG DIAGONAL GASH in the canvas. \nHe ambles up the ramp, stepping over collapsed patrons, pausing at every fourth or fifth painting. Monet water lilies, a Degas ballerina -- all get the razor treatment. Behind him his CRONIES work their way up the ramp, HEAVING BLACK PAINT on every canvas the JOKER has missed. \nHe cocks an eyebrow at Edvard Munch's \"THE SCREAM.\" \nJOKER (cont.) I kinda like this one. Leave it. \nINT. TEA ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - EVENING \nVICKI at her table, still wearing the gas mask, scared as hell. The overhead lights wink out and the room goes dark. The JOKER saunters over and pulls up a chair. \nJOKER I think it's safe to take that off. \nVICKI recognizes the deranged smile instantly. She removes the gas mask, tries to gather her wits. \nJOKER (cont.) You're quite beautiful. \nVICKI ... Thank you. \nJOKER Unfortunate, but I think we can work around it. \nHe sets a couple of CANDLESTICKS on the table and reaches for his lighter. A LONG JET OF FLAME shoots out, Jerry Lewis-style, as he lights the candles. \nJOKER (cont.) You're Vicki Vale. I guess you know who I am. -- Is this your portfolio? \nShe nods. He opens it, begins leafing through the record of VICKI's career. Newspaper photos from the Globe, at first. Then fashion layouts, magazine covers of celebrities. Artier B&W shots from VICKI's first couple of exhibitions. \nJOKER (cont.) Crap. Crap. Crap, crap, crap... Ahhh. Now here's what caught my eye. \nHe's come to the COMBAT PHOTOS from Corto Maltese. \nJOKER (cont.) The panic. The bloody skulls. The armless screaming fellows... you know, the atrocities. (smirking) Somehow, when you shoot it, it all comes out so clean, so lovely. \nVICKI is squirming, but she doesn't think it wise to debate the point. Not with this lunatic, anyway. \nJOKER (cont.) I guess I'm just an old cornball, but... I live for beauty. I look around at my little city, it gets me down. (indicating the photos) We don't have anything like this. Well, it came to me that what this city needs... is beautification. Kind of a big makeover. (enraptured) Miss Vale, I finally realized that one man can make a difference. You know the saying. \"In his image... created he them\"? \nVICKI gazes at the awful face of this deranged visionary, getting more frightened by the minute. \nVICKI And you want a -- \nJOKER A visual record, yes. A before-and- after kind of thing. (leaning closer) This could make your reputation. \nHer first impulse is to get up and run. But she fights the impulse. She won't run... not until she gets this maniac on film. She reaches for her camera bag. \nVICKI Maybe we should start with a portrait of the artist. People might like to see the face behind the makeup. \nJOKER (momentarily puzzled) ... Behind the makeup? \nThen it sinks in. By candlelight, in the darkened restaurant, with his pancake makeup and his black rinse job, he looks practically normal. VICKI must think she's looking at his real face! \nJOKER (cont.) Oh. Yes. I see what you mean. \nHe finds a pitcher, pours a glass of water, and very carefully SETS IT ON THE TABLE in front of VICKI. Then -- suddenly, inexplicably -- HE BARKS AT HER: \nJOKER (cont.) Silly little TWIT -- I can't take you ANYWHERE! \nHe sits back and grins expectantly. VICKI is thoroughly nonplussed by this bizarre outburst. A moment passes. \nHe obviously wants her to do something, but she hasn't got a clue as to what it is. Growing impatient now, he POINTS at the WATER GLASS: \nJOKER (cont.) Well? What are you waiting for?? \nNow VICKI gets the point. She picks up the glass and HURLS ITS CONTENTS in THE JOKER'S FACE. \nHis hands go up. He writhes. He shrieks -- like the Wicked Witch of the West dissolving. He reaches for a napkin to wipe his face clean... and begins to CACKLE. \nHis awful white-and-green clown's face revealed behind the running makeup, he LEERS at her. \nJOKER (cont.) You see, Miss Vale -- that was my makeup. (leaning forward) What do you think? \nVICKI is repulsed, but she's determined to tough it out. \nVICKI I've seen worse. Much worse. \nJOKER Strong stomach, huh? I like that in a woman. -- Maybe we can do business after all. \nThe engines are revving up even as BATMAN vaults into the cockpit alongside VICKI. \nGuns in hand, the JOKER'S GOONS Are stumbling out of the Fluegelheim, hacking, coughing, blinded by smoke. They DIVE FOR THEIR LIVES as the BATMOBILE comes barrelling out of the alley at ninety miles an hour. \nTHE JOKER emerges just as the BATMOBILE careens off. \nJOKER I WANT HIM!! I WANT HIM!! \nThe JOKER climbs into the back of a van labelled \"MONARCH PLAYING CARDS.\"  Half his GOONS pile into the van behind him, the other half into a second car nearby. \nEXT. STREETS - THAT MOMENT \nSIRENS HOWL as POLICE CARS converge on the Flugelheim. \nINT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT \nroaring out into CITY TRAFFIC. \nVICKI Look! Police! \nBATMAN I called them. \nVICKI Shouldn't we -- \nA POLICE CAR whizzes past the BATMOBILE. TIRES SKID. The COP CAR does a quick 180 and sets out in hot pursuit of the BATMOBILE. BATMAN FLOORS THE ACCELERATOR in response. \nINT. VAN - THAT MOMENT \nTIGHT ON the demented face of THE JOKER. A GOON calls out from the front of the van. \nGOON There they are! Dead ahead! \nTHE JOKER screams into a RADIO DISPATCHER'S MIKE. \nJOKER ALL UNITS! SOUTHBOUND ON RIVERVIEW! \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nThe JOKER'S ARMY. THUGS in cars. CREEPS in Italian restaurants. CROOKED COPS at a coffee shop. LIGHTS FLASH, BEEPERS SOUND, and within seconds they're racing to the streets, eager to join the chase. \nSERIES OF SHOTS - THE STREETS \nCOP CARS. GOON CARS. THE BATMOBILE streaks through an intersection, nearly causing a pileup. THE JOKER'S VAN makes short work of a SABRETT'S HOT DOG STAND in its path. \nINT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT \nPEDESTRIANS GAWK as the sleek supercar RIPS UP THE PAVEMENT. \nVICKI What about her? What about the girl? \nBATMAN He won't kill her. (gritting his teeth) GODDAMMIT! \nThey're moving up on an EMPTY BLOCK -- a NIGHT CONSTRUCTION TEAM. A HUGE PIECE OF HEAVY MACHINERY backs up slowly and inexorably, BLOCKING THE INTERSECTION. \nBATMAN GUNS THE ENGINE. SWERVES LEFT. TRIES TO SLIDE PAST. And HITS THE BRAKES -- stopping inches short of a head-on collision with a lamppost. \nHe jumps out of the car. No chance to get through. THE JOKER'S VAN is two blocks back and coming up fast. \nONLOOKERS and CONSTRUCTION WORKERS are beginning to form a crowd around them. \nVICKI Can't we -- \nBATMAN Too many people. Come on! (as she scrambles out) SHIELDS!! \nThe BATMOBILE's computerized VOICE replies: \nCOMPUTER Shields. \nWith a series or CLANGS, CHROME-STEEL PLATES slide into place -- across the cockpit, over the tires -- leaving the BATMOBILE an inert, impenetrable BLOCK OF BLACK METAL. \nBATMAN and VICKI sprint through the CONSTRUCTION SITE, vaulting over mounds of loose dirt and concrete rubble. \nINT. VAN - MOVING - NIGHT \nTHREE POLICE CARS, red lights blazing, OVERTAKE THE JOKER'S VAN and bear down on the abandoned BATMOBILE. \nGOON AT WHEEL Are they ours? \nJOKER ... I don't know. We'd better get out of here. (into RADIO MIKE) Westbound on 36th. DO YOU COPY?? \nThe VAN does a discreet U-turn and rumbles off sedately down the street. \nEXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nBATMAN and VICKI zigzag past storefronts and candy stands, dodging astonished PEDESTRIANS. \nINT. CAR - MOVING - THAT MOMENT \nFOUR GOONS with GUNS. They spot BATMAN and VICKI coming off the side street. GOON I, the driver, speaks into a radio: \nGOON I We got 'em! \nJOKER (V.O.) (over radio) Take 'em! I want his head! \nEXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nGOON I Who cares? Wax that freak. \nThey turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened. \nIn one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall. \nGOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut. \nFour seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger. \nBRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE. \nThrough all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl. \nON VICKI \nShe finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up, grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet her. \nVICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the roll, then drops it down her blouse. \nBut BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there. \nIt's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous glance over her shoulder every couple of steps. \nThen, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS. \nBATMAN ... Not even a 'thank you'? \nVICKI Well -- I think you might consider thanking me. You were good as dead. \nBATMAN That's because you lied about your weight. (a long pause) Thank you. \nVICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm. \nBATMAN (cont.) I'll have to ask you for that film. \nVICKI I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you. \nBATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps. \nBATMAN Please. \nVICKI I won't let you have it. \nTHE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly. \nVICKI (cont.) I know you can break my neck and take it. But the Joker's on that same roll. I -- \nBATMAN The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So -- \nVICKI Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures. \nBATMAN All right, here's a compromise. I'll develop the photos. You keep the Jokers and I'll keep the rest. \nVICKI How do I know you won't keep them all? \nBATMAN Because I'll take you with me. \nHe reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to him. \nStill cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto shots, which are still stashed in her blouse. \nBATMAN (cont.) Thank you, Vicki. \nVICKI ... Where are you going to take me? \nNo reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand delicately along the line of her cheek... \n... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS into BATMAN's arms. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT \nStreet level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at the BATMOBILE two blocks down. \nThe car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact. But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL OVER the fearsome machine. \nBATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the Batmobile. \nHe's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT. \nBATMAN Shields open. \nEXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE \nTWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From within they hear the tinny computerized voice: \nCOMPUTER Shields open. \nThe steel plates begin to retract. \nBATMAN (V.O.) (over radio) Ignition. \nCOMPUTER Ignition. \nBATMAN (cont.) They don't come down here. They're afraid of the lights. \nVICKI I don't like bats. Not that kind. \nBATMAN They used to terrify me. But I forced myself to keep coming back, and -- (smiling) -- I guess I became the thing I feared the most. I'll do your photos now. \nHe goes to a HIGH-SPEED PHOTO PROCESSING MACHINE -- the kind they have at Fotomat, only better -- and loads the roll. \nVICKI wanders over to the edge of a DEEP BLACK PIT. She kicks a pebble over. Long seconds pass; no sound. \nShe looks up. Suspended over the bottomless pit are a pair of GYMNAST'S RINGS. This guy is dedicated. \nVICKI Who pays for all this? \nBATMAN I have sponsors. \nVICKI The computers? \nBATMAN I'm running a check on the tainted products. There is a pattern. Beauty products. Personal hygiene. \nVICKI No more makeup. -- Looks like we'll all be showing our true faces now. \nShe looks straight at him. It's almost a direct request. But BATMAN is preoccupied with the matter at hand. \nBATMAN I've tracked all the records. Every shipment, every warehouse, every loading dock. Nothing. No opportunities for tampering. Somehow the Joker is supplying tainted ingredients... at the source. \nVICKI Wait. You can just tap into any corporate database you want? Anywhere? \nBATMAN Oh, no. I let the FBI do that. Then I tap into the FBI. -- Your photos are ready. \nHe holds up a hand to VICKI: stand back. Then he checks out the pictures -- SMILING as he shuffles through the prints. \nVICKI You could've killed him, you know. You could have killed the Joker. \nBATMAN I had to save you, Vicki. (turning to face her) Here you go. I think I'll let you keep the whole set. \nShe looks at the photos. Joker. Joker. Joker. And four shots of the BATMAN in action. He's without his mask, but there's no clean angle on his face. \nVICKI doesn't quite know why, but her head is reeling. \nBATMAN (cont.) Care for an autograph? \nHe takes one of the prints, scrawls on it, hands it to her with the inscription: \"TO VICKI. LOVE, B.\" \nNow he turns to shut down the photo machine. VICKI is trembling. Her hand goes to her belt, finds the telephoto roll concealed in her blouse. She steps up silently behind him, reaches for his cowl. At the last second... she STOPS. \nVICKI ... Bruce? \nHE FREEZES IN PLACE for an indecisive moment. Then: \nBATMAN Are you talking to me? \nHe turns in seeming incomprehension. And shows her a SMILE... the same crooked, curious, childlike smile she saw on BRUCE's face that morning when she caught him singing. \nBATMAN (cont.) Maybe we've had enough for one night. I'll take you home. \nAlmost in a trance now, she lets him lead her to the BATMOBILE. As she takes her seat he reaches into his utility belt for another KNOCKOUT CAPSULE. \nBATMAN (cont.) Do you want to do it this time? \nVICKI doesn't move. She looks at the capsule in her hand as he walks over to the driver's side and gets in. \nBATMAN (cont.) Don't be afraid. I'm here. \nShe takes one last look at the familiar SMILE beneath the mask... then breaks the capsule and BREATHES DEEP. \nFLAME ERUPTS from the rear of the Batmobile as the after- burners kick in and BATMAN screeches off. A FIERY RED GLOW fills the screen, BURNING OUT THE IMAGE as we \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. GOTHAM STREET - 1963 - NIGHT (DREAM SEQUENCE) \nThe red glow resolves itself into a DREAMLIKE STREET SCENE: liquid, weightless figures moving in a tinted, soundless cityscape as DISTANT, TINKLY CARNIVAL MUSIC plays underneath. We're outside a theatre watching first-nighters emerge from the opening of a hit musical. \nIn the crowd we pick out THREE FIGURES: DR. THOMAS WAYNE, his wife MARTHA, and -- in THOMAS's arms -- their young son BRUCE. BRUCE hasn't made it through the show. He's asleep, head nestled peacefully against his father's shoulder. \nTHOMAS rouses the boy gently, sets him down on the sidewalk. BRUCE rubs the sleep from his eyes as THOMAS puts an arm around his wife. Together they begin walking. \nIN A SINGLE CUT the crowd has DISAPPEARED, and the WAYNES are walking toward us up a deserted street. THOMAS and MARTHA are laughing, making jokes, reaching down to tousle BRUCE's hair. Their FACES, as they draw closer, are FULL OF JOY. And then, without warning -- \nA HANDGUN enters frame. \nThe WAYNES freeze in their tracks. THOMAS steps protectively in front of his wife, reaches for his wallet, begins unbuckling his watch. He won't put up a fight. \nMARTHA's hand goes involuntarily to the PEARL NECKLACE at her throat. \nThe GUNMAN sees it, gestures for her to hand it over. But MARTHA is paralyzed, afraid to move. \nThe GUNMAN steps past THOMAS, SNATCHES AT THE NECKLACE. \nThe instant his wife is threatened, THOMAS ATTACKS. The pearl strand BREAKS in the GUNMAN'S HAND as he drops toward the sidewalk. \nA SILENT BURST OF FLAME erupts from the muzzle of the gun. \nTHOMAS CRUMPLES. MARTHA emits a PIERCING SHRIEK -- a shriek we cannot hear -- \nVICKI He has to tell someone. And I'm the one. He's trying to tell me. \nKNOX, hurt in a way he doesn't fully understand, gets up and pulls on his coat. He stares at her coldly: \nKNOX Well, when he does you know my number. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. NEWSSTAND - DAY \nCUSTOMERS are lining up to buy the early edition of the Globe, which carries the full-page banner headline: \nWAR OF THE FREAKS Batman, Joker in Fluegelheim Shootout \nIn the midst of the hubbub a DELIVERY TRUCK cruises past, dumping a bundle of AFTERNOON EDITIONS on the sidewalk. \"WAR OF THE FREAKS\" has been relegated to the lower right- hand corner of the page -- supplanted by more pressing news: \nSTOCK MARKET CRASHES Product Scare Drops Dow to 1100 Biggest One-Day Decline in History \nINT. WAYNE FOUNDATION - DAY \nBRUCE in a plush office suite downtown, on the phone to his broker. Behind his desk is a big plate-glass window with a fortieth-floor view of the financial district, so he can wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down. \nBRUCE Don't sell. It won't last. We'll ride it out. \nWith exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA - A MOMENT LATER - DAY \nBRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the hook. \nINT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY \nBRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls. The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY. \nWAILING COLLEAGUE ... a nine-million-dollar bath! \nBRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the door to a men's room, looks around cautiously, then enters. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY \nA small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver: \nBRUCE (the familiar rasp) Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing. \nINT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DAY \nVICKI (hesitantly) ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - ON BRUCE \nBRUCE (a little smile) Who's this \"Bruce\"? Are you trying to make me jealous? \nVICKI (V.O.) (filter) I'm serious, Bruce. We have to -- \nAt this very moment, a DAZED FINANCIER enters from behind. \nFINANCIER Hi, Bruce. \nBRUCE automatically claps a hand over the mouthpiece. His face goes slack as he hangs up -- with VICKI'S TINNY VOICE still squeaking on the other end of the line. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nHARVEY DENT at a big desk, flanked by a number of POLITICOS. \nDENT ... We deal. \nADVISER Harvey, please. I mean -- (shaking his head) If your first official act as D.A. is to cut a deal with a terrorist... \nDENT Screw that, Ed. We've got a market panic of national proportions. -- We've got 786 people dead. (beat) I won't sacrifice one more life for the sake of appearing strong. \nPOLITICO Harvey's right. We've got the 300th anniversary gala coming up. The networks won't even send in a crew. \nADVISER Harvey, the police are working round the clock, the feds are coming in. This thing could break any minute now. (turning) Tell him, Jim. \nCOMMISSIONER GORDON reaches into his vest pocket for a cigar. He clips the end off, lights it, takes a long drag... and STARES GLUMLY at the floor. \nGORDON Cut the deal. \nINT. CITY HALL - NIGHT \nThe MAYOR sits impatiently at a long table, flanked by JIM GORDON, HARVEY DENT, and other prominent officials. The room is packed with REPORTERS and TV NEWS CREWS. \nNEWS ANCHOR ... at City Hall, where the mayor is waiting to open negotiations with the clown-faced terrorist known as the Joker. It is now eight minutes past the appointed deadline, and still no word from -- \nINT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nREPORTERS cluster around a bank of four TV sets, each tuned to a different station, all broadcasting from city Hall. \nREPORTER I Look at 'em sweat. Can't wait for the next Gallup Poll. \nREPORTER II Hey Knox, cheer up. It ain't the Batman but it's pretty choice. \nKNOX, who has recently taken up smoking, responds with a grunt. SUDDEN HUBBUB from the ONLOOKERS as a wave of VIDEO NOISE wipes half the screen away. \nEXT. GOTHAM PARK - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe weekend-long BIRTHDAY GALA is getting underway, and Gotham Park is mobbed with CELEBRANTS enjoying a FREE CONCERT. Onstage: FIVE ELVIS IMITATORS, dressed in everything from black leather to white spangled jumpsuits, representing the King in progressive stages of deterioration. \nINT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DUSK \nShe's on the sofa beside a disconsolate BRUCE. \nVICKI ... So we just pretend none of this ever happened. We never met. We -- (frightened) You're going to get yourself killed, Bruce. You know that, don't you? \nBRUCE It wouldn't matter much. \nVICKI I don't understand it. You can do so much good for people. As Bruce Wayne. \nHe sinks back on the sofa, closes his eyes. He's had the same argument with himself a thousand times. \nBRUCE Money makes money, Vicki. The foundation runs itself. -- I'm extraneous to the process. \nVICKI You're one man. You can't save everybody. \nBRUCE What it I could save a handful? -- What if I could save one? \nVICKI is sick of watching BRUCE torment himself. She stands up, almost crying now, and ACCUSES HIM DIRECTLY: \nVICKI Bruce, at the rate you're going, you can't even save yourself. \nBRUCE (staring right at her) Sometimes... I don't know if there's enough of me left to save. \nVICKI is totally drained. She heads for the kitchen. \nVICKI Oh, God. I've got to have some coffee or something. \nA moment's breather as BRUCE sits on the sofa reflecting. Then, suddenly, a KNOCK at the door. \nVICKI reappears and moves to answer the door. BRUCE -- on his feet instantly -- grabs her by the shoulder. \nBRUCE Are you expecting anyone? \nShe nods no. He goes to the peephole in the door. \nBRUCE (cont.) Who's there? \nTHROUGH THE PEEPHOLE he sees a DELIVERY BOY. \nDELIVERY BOY Package tor Miss Vale. \nBRUCE Set it down by the door. On the left-hand side. \nThe DELIVERY BOY sets the package down and wanders off, tipless, muttering something about \"cheap shits.\" After a moment's interval, BRUCE opens the door and bends to pick up the mysterious package. \nAnother brown-paper parcel... ADDRESSED IN CRAYON. \nVICKI BRUCE! \nHe strides past her, handling the parcel gingerly, and sets it down on the kitchen counter. \nVICKI (cont.) It's just like the last time. He sent me a present before he -- \nBRUCE Very thoughtful. Don't touch it. \nAs VICKI watches, he goes into the living-room and finds his ALLIGATOR ATTACHE CASE. He opens the case, removes a LAPTOP COMPUTER and a handful of business papers... then lifts out a false bottom to reveal his UTILITY BELT. \nVICKI Oh, Bruce. Don't tell me you carry it around with you. \nBRUCE I feel naked without it. \nHe takes out a tiny ULTRASOUND SCANNER -- rather like a stethoscope, with a miniature sonar display where the earpieces should be -- and runs it over the package. \nBRUCE (cont.) Not a bomb. But it could be rigged. Wait in the next room. \nHe takes a small GAS MASK from his belt, puts it on, then SLITS THE WRAPPING with a steak knife. \nNothing. Cautiously, he pulls back the flaps. The box is full of STYROFOAM POPCORN. BRUCE shoves a hand down into the popcorn... and extracts a HUMAN EAR. \nIn the doorway behind him, VICKI lets out a squeal. \nBRUCE grabs the box and dumps TWO DOZEN EARS on the counter. \nBRUCE ... They're wax. \nVICKI finds a hand-scrawled NOTE among the ears. \nVICKI \"It worked for Van Gogh. Let's make up. I'll need you soon.\" -- Whew. \nBRUCE (lost in thought) That does it. It's going to be this weekend. \nThe KITCHEN PHONE rings. VICKI reaches for the receiver. Her eyes go wide and she gestures him over. \nINT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT \nALICIA, in her porcelain mask, on the phone. \nALICIA I thought you ought to know -- he's coming for you... \nON BRUCE AND VICKI \nThe VAN DRIVER guns through a red light. BRAKES SQUEAL on either side. In the back of the van, the JOKER GROWLS: \nJOKER Slow down, you maniac! \nEXT. INTERSECTION - THAT MOMENT - EVENING \nAs the VAN ROARS PAST, a MOUNTED POLICEMAN shakes his fist. His horse shies, rears back, turns in a circle. He's just about gotten the beast calmed down when a MAN IN A STOCKING MASK plummets down on a rope from nowhere and lands directly behind him on the horse's back. \nBRUCE elbows the startled COP. Now there's only one rider. The VAN turns left. BRUCE gallops straight ahead through the intersection, hoping to cut the JOKER off. \nINT. ALICIA HUNT'S APARTMENT - THAT MOMENT \nALICIA peers out through the window. On the street below, UNMARKED CARS are converging. \nINT. VAN - THAT MOMENT \nThe JOKER and co. are two blocks away from ALICIA's. They see a POLICE SWAT TEAM sealing off the building. \nDRIVER Boss! Jesus! They've -- \nJOKER They'll be sorry. They'll be sorry. -- GET OUT OF HERE! \nEXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT - EVENING \nBRUCE on horseback, charging past elegant old brownstones, drawing stares from passersby. We get a quick look at the FLASHING RED SIGNAL LIGHT on his belt. \nEXT. RIVERVIEW DRIVE - THAT MOMENT - EVENING \nA YELLOW VW BUG rips up the street at 70 mph. \nINT. VOLKSWAGEN BUG - THAT MOMENT \nWe can't see the driver. But we do see, on the seat beside him, a VIDEO DISPLAY with a shifting grid map of the city -- and on it, a FLASHING SIGNAL blinking in perfect sync with the one on BRUCE's belt. \nEXT. SIDE STREET - THAT MOMENT \nBRUCE sees the VW bug rounding the corner and STREAKING TOWARD HIM. He reins in the horse; it rears back on its hind legs in a classic western pose; the BUG zooms past -- \n-- and ALFRED THE BUTLER heaves out a BROWN LAUNDRY BUNDLE, neatly tied in string. \nBRUCE snatches it out of the air, gives ALFRED a quick salute -- and the BUG is gone. \nINT. JOKER'S VAN - EVENING \nThe JOKER and his boys are stalled in heavy traffic at the southern border of Gotham Park. POLICE BARRICADES are everywhere; the surrounding streets have been roped off for the birthday gala. HORNS HONK in anger. \nJOKER MOVE! Can't you do something?? \nDRIVER It's some kind of detour. They're backed up for blocks! \nThe JOKER snorts. He happens to glance into the side-view mirror. What he sees there... CURDLES HIS BLOOD. \nJOKER Oh my God. How does he do it... ? \nEXT. STREET - A BLOCK AWAY - THAT MOMENT \nTHE BATMAN, IN FULL COSTUMED GLORY, GALLOPING UP THE STREET ON HORSEBACK -- passing stunned COPS, weaving in and around the stalled autos, GAINING FAST on the JOKER. \nINT. VAN - THAT MOMENT \nTHE JOKER climbing all over the DRIVER. He HITS THE GAS, RUNS THE VAN UP ON THE SIDEWALK, and -- at the first opening he sees -- CRASHES THROUGH A POLICE BARRICADE INTO GOTHAM PARK ITSELF. \nBATMAN is half a block behind him now. As he follows hot on the JOKER's heels, TWO HELICOPTERS swing into the park from overhead. \nEXT. GOTHAM PARK - EVENING \nCROWDS EVERYWHERE. On the central platform where we saw the FREE CONCERT earlier, an EMCEE mans the microphone: \nEMCEE -- the most spectacular, most death- defying aerial stunt ever devised. Tonight -- for the first time anywhere -- THE FLYING GRAYSONS! \nHe points up at the two approaching HELICOPTERS, flying side-by-side in tight formation some forty feet apart. \nANGLE ON HELICOPTERS \nONLOOKERS GASP as TWO TRAPEZES drop from the bellies of the twin copters. Dangling from the trapezes are the FLYING GRAYSONS -- a husband-and-wife aerialist team in spangled red-and-green suits. They begin swinging toward each other in a plane perpendicular to the path of the copters. \nEXT. GOTHAM PARK - GROUND LEVEL \nPANIC DOWN BELOW as the JOKER's van barrels through the crowd, HORN BLARING. BATMAN is moving up swiftly. \nOn each wrist he's wearing a MINIATURE ROCKET LAUNCHER. He lets fly with TWO SALVOS. The first explodes harmlessly against a tree. The second HITS THE REAR DOOR OF THE VAN -- driving it off the access road down into the brush, where it nearly topples over sideways. \nANGLE ON FLYING GRAYSONS \nGRAYSON has just completed a double somersault in midair, landing in the capable hands of his wife. Now they're swinging again, building momentum as he prepares to make the return leap back to his own trapeze. \nINT. HELICOPTER - THAT MOMENT \nIn the bay of the helicopter stands a kid, fifteen, compact, tough, and wiry: DICK GRAYSON. Like his parents, he's wearing a red-and-green suit. From the copter, he's got a perfect bird's-eye view of the BATMAN-JOKER chase. \nPILOT Ready to go, Dick? \nDICK What's all the ruckus down there? \nEXT. PARK - GROUND LEVEL - THAT MOMENT \nINSERT - TELEVISION SCREEN \nA taped report from the hallway outside ALICIA's apartment. COPS and FORENSICS MEN mill about in the b.g. \nREPORTER ... on a tip attributed to the mysterious Batman. The apartment was booby-trapped with the Joker's laughing gas, leaving 17 policemen dead. (beat) Also found dead at the scene was Alicia Hunt, 26, a former model -- \nCAMERA PULLS BACK to reveal that the TV SCREEN is part of BRUCE'S BANK OF MONITORS, deep in the Batcave. The other screens show the various rooms of Wayne Manor, all empty. \nWe move now to the video display of a COMPUTER WORKSTATION, showing TWO FACES side-by-side: a mug shot of JACK NAPIER and a freeze-frame of the JOKER from one of his pirate transmissions. A GRAPHICS PROGRAM abstracts the twin heads into THREE-DIMENSIONAL, ROTATING TOPOLOGICAL GRIDS -- and, as we watch, the two spinning heads COLLIDE AND MERGE. Except for the fearsome grin, they MESH PERFECTLY. \nYet another terminal: BRUCE's database. The same phrase flashes again and again, scrolling up the screen: ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. ACE CHEMICAL CO. \nAnd, finally: BRUCE HIMSELF, slumped at a table, his head in his hands. He's realized, to his horror, that he is responsible for the birth of the Joker. And frankly... he would just as soon be dead. \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - GUEST BEDROOM - DAY \nDICK GRAYSON is sprawled on a huge four-poster bed, unconscious, softly moaning. He COMES TO with a jolt. \nBreaking into a sweat almost instantly, he looks at his unfamiliar surroundings. A shadowy figure stands nearby. \nDICK ... Where am I? \nBRUCE My name is Bruce Wayne. You're welcome to stay here as long as you want. \nBRUCE steps out just as ALFRED enters with a breakfast tray. DICK makes a puzzled face. What the hell is going on here? \nINT. HALL OF JUSTICE - DAY \nBeneath the statue of blind Justice, BRUCE and HARVEY DENT march through the portico, engaged in a heated argument. \nDENT We'll send a team into Ace the moment the warrant comes through. \nBRUCE He'll be ready when you do. Remember what happened at the apartment. \nDENT All right, Bruce, what do you suggest? \nBRUCE I suggest a nice big bomb. \nDENT Good. A bomb. On a blind tip from Bruce Wayne. -- We do have laws. \nBRUCE Then for God's sake, Harvey, cancel the anniversary celebration. \nDENT We've told him we'll deal. What could he possibly have to gain by -- \nBRUCE Do you still think the Joker cares about money?? \nDENT I don't know. I'm just a D.A. I don't have access to all your expert sources. \nMexican standoff. BRUCE stalks off fuming. DENT hangs back a moment, then turns down the hall. \nEXT. WAYNE MANOR - ESTABLISHING - DAY \nThe ornate, wrought-iron GATE which opens on the long driveway snaking up toward Wayne Manor. It's bolted shut. \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY \nA glass-enclosed room which houses an enormous HEATED INDOOR SWIMMING POOL. DICK GRAYSON does a couple of laps, then climbs out and towels himself off. \nHe looks out at the estate: tennis courts, a riding stable in the distance. He's not happy. All this opulence could drive a guy stark staring nuts in short order. \nINT. GUEST BEDROOM - DAY \nAn OPEN SUITCASE on the bed. DICK fingers a gold ashtray bearing the figure of Winged Victory -- then shrugs and tosses it into the suitcase on top of his gymnast's costume. When he looks up he sees BRUCE in the doorway behind him. \nDICK ... Your butler wouldn't gimme a ride so I figured I'd hoof it. \nBRUCE Sorry. I can't let you leave. \nDICK You can't keep me here, man. That's kidnapping. \nBRUCE If I let you leave, you'll do the same thing again. You'll go after the Joker... and you'll wind up dead. (turning to go) \nDICK Hey, man. Look at you. You're rich. You got everything you want. How do you know what's in my mind? \nBRUCE turns to face him. The little hellion's eyes are filled with raw, burning hatred. BRUCE knows the feeling. \nBRUCE I don't care what's in your mind. You're staying. \nBRUCE reaches for a key in his pocket. Without warning, the kid RUSHES him, throwing a rock-solid punch. With blinding speed, BRUCE sidesteps him, parries the blow, and winds up spinning DICK around -- INTO A WALL. \nDICK is stunned, but he has to laugh. This rich boy has a move or two. BRUCE stands there, silently challenging him. \nA second later, the kid is airborne -- upping the ante with a scissor-kick aimed squarely at BRUCE's gut. In a blur of motion BRUCE checks the kick, swings an arm into DICK's chest, and sends the boy sprawling flat on his back. \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - KITCHEN - THAT MOMENT \nALFRED, in his apron, fixing a tray of snacks. He looks up curiously at the ceiling. From the sound of it, a battle royal is shaping up in the guest bedroom. \nINT. GUEST BEDROOM - THAT MOMENT \nDICK'S BODY -- head down, feet up -- flies through the air. He SMASHES INTO a closet door and slumps to the carpet. Shaken now, and sweating profusely, he looks up at BRUCE... who stands calmly over him, adjusting his necktie. \nA long, tense moment passes between them. Then: \nDICK ... You're him. \nHOLD ON BRUCE'S GAZE -- grim, alert, determined -- as the clock hits 7:45. An ALARM SOUNDS, BREAKING THE SILENCE with its grating electronic WHINE. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. ACE CHEMICAL - AERIAL SHOT - NIGHT \nThe trademark ace on the illuminated sign. From our vantage point high above, we can see THREE CARGO TRUCKS rolling out the main gates. A half-mile away, THE BATMOBILE cruises up the waterfront, approaching soundlessly, its headlights off... preparing for a final showdown with the JOKER's forces. \nINT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe JOKER'S MINIONS, working late, readying a huge shipment. At an open loading bay, we find a DISPATCHER with a clipboard, directing MORE UNMARKED TRUCKS in the lot outside. \nDISPATCHER Boston, Philly: loading bay one. \nEXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe BATMOBILE stops short of the main gate. ENGINES ROAR and the supercar ACCELERATES, SMASHING THROUGH THE GATE and taking half the chain-link fence with it. \nIn the guard's booth, ARMED GOONS pull guns as the BATMOBILE streaks across the parking lot and LAUNCHES A ROCKET at the corrugated metal door which opens on the factory floor. A THUNDEROUS EXPLOSION tears a gaping hole in the door. \nINT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe BATMOBILE cruises through the flaming wreckage and SKIDS TO A HALT on the refinery floor. The JOKER'S MEN are everywhere. They take one look at the BATMOBILE, PANIC, and PELT THE CAR with a barrage of MACHINE-GUN FIRE. \nCRACKS begin to spread across the Batmobile's plexiglass dome. Within moments, the windshield SHATTERS -- and COLLAPSES ALTOGETHER. \nINT. BATMOBILE - THAT MOMENT \nBULLETS rip through the upholstered passenger seats. It doesn't matter. The car is empty. No one's driving. \nTRACK IN on the computer console -- where a familiar tinny voice calmly repeats its pre-programmed command: \nCOMPUTER ... Detonate. \nA beat. Then: BLAM. \nINT. POLICE CAR - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nA CONVOY approaches Ace Chemical -- GORDON's team preparing to raid the plant. Inside each car: SPECIAL UNIT COPS dressed in asbestos suits, gas masks in their laps. \nAll at once, a BRILLIANT RED GLARE suffuses the sky. \nCOP Good Lord! \nEXT. ACE CHEMICAL - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nTHE JOKER'S MEN running for their lives across the parking lot, KNOCKED FLAT by the force of SIX DEAFENING EXPLOSIONS. For a few seconds everything is flame and fury. And then -- \nAll that's left of Ace Chemical is a pile of charred rubble and a PILLAR OF THICK BLACK SMOKE, spiraling up to the sky. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ANDREWS ISLAND - NIGHT \nDAZZLING FIREWORKS explode in the night sky over Gotham Harbor. SEARCHLIGHTS sweep across the mammoth, welcoming stone figure of LADY GOTHAM -- still wrapped in canvas, ready to be unveiled. \nTHOUSANDS OF RUBBERNECKERS jam every square inch of Andrew's Island. COPS ON HORSEBACK speak into walkie- talkies as they patrol the edges of the crowd. Across the Harbor, Ace Chemical is going up in flames -- but as far as the crowd can tell, with all the noise and excitement, it's just another part of the celebration. \nAt the base of the statue, GOVERNOR GILROY speaks into a microphone: \nGOVERNOR GILROY As Governor of this great state, it is now my honor to unveil for you a very special lady -- a lady who stands tall for life and liberty -- America's favorite lady... LADY GOTHAM! \nThe CROWD begins to APPLAUD RHYTHMICALLY, chanting 'LADY GOTHAM! LADY GOTHAM!' It's like Times Square on New Year's Eve, waiting for the big ball to drop. GILROY hoists a pair of oversized scissors and cuts a ceremonial ribbon: hydraulic CRANES kick into gear: CABLES DROP FREE, and the canvas cover draws back from LADY GOTHAM's face... \n... to a chorus of SCREAMS from the crowd. LADY GOTHAM IS WEARING A GRISLY JOKER GRIN!!! \nSuddenly -- in the midst of the hysteria -- THE SEARCHLIGHTS DIE. The STAGE LIGHTS BLINK OUT. ANDREWS ISLAND IS PLUNGED INTO DARKNESS. Instantaneous mass panic: the GOVERNOR shouts to his aides as ONLOOKERS mob the stage. COPS are knocked from their horses as the CROWD stampedes. PANDEMONIUM RULES. \nAnd across the harbor... block by block... GOTHAM CITY IS GOING DARK. \nEXT. GOTHAM SKIES - AERIAL SHOTS - NIGHT \nQUICK SHOTS of FOUR HELICOPTERS hovering at different points over the blacked-out city. LOUDSPEAKERS blare out a PRE-RECORDED MESSAGE: \nJOKER (V.O.) HAPPY BIRTHDAY, Gotham. Here's a little token of my esteem. HAVE FUN... 'cause THE PARTY'S ON ME! \nINSANE LAUGHTER echoes. CARGO BAYS open wide. The JOKER'S HELICOPTERS begin LEAFLETING THE CITY... with MONEY! \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nANARCHY IN GOTHAM as high-denomination bills flutter to earth, blanketing the streets. HOPELESSLY OUTMANNED COPS try to maintain order as SOLID CITIZENS trample one another in a paroxysm of ANIMAL GREED. BUILDINGS EMPTY as APARTMENT DWELLERS race outside. ALL TRAFFIC STOPS as DRIVERS climb out of their cars to SNATCH MONEY FROM THE AIR. \nDARKNESS EVERYWHERE. In the pitch-black subways, TERRIFIED COMMUTERS are seized by claustrophobia. GLASS SHATTERS, DOORS BREAK OPEN as they claw their way out of stalled subway cars and SPILL OUT onto the tracks. \nOn the streets above, GOTHAM'S CRIMINAL ELEMENT is having a field day. The cops are preoccupied, utterly helpless against the first waves of RIOTING AND LOOTING. \nFLAMES ERUPT. PUNKS race down the street carrying fur coats and color TV's. LOOTERS break through the display window of an electronics store, and climb in among the goodies... only to FLY OUT, two seconds later, on the wrong end of a SHOTGUN BLAST. THE JOKER'S DREAM IS COMING TRUE. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nIn a crouch on the pavement, snapping photos of the wild street action, is VICKI -- fearless, professional, doing her job. A battered FORD ESCORT cruises up behind her. \nKNOX VICKI! \nVICKI sees KNOX, climbs into the passenger seat. He's wearing a big smile. They're jazzed, oblivious to danger. \nKNOX GIMME A HAND UP HERE! \nVICKI climbs aboard. They drape the cape over the face of the spotlight. Then they put their shoulders to the swivel assembly -- tilting the spotlight -- AIMING THE BEAM... \n... DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER'S WHITE CLOWN BALLOON!!! \nINT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT \nBATMAN stares at the CLOWN BALLOON dead ahead. On its massive distended belly... a BURNING YELLOW OVAL. And in the center of the oval... THE BLACK SILHOUETTE OF A BAT. \nBATMAN'S MOUTH drops open. He understands. \nEXT. AVENUE - ON JOKER'S FLOAT - THAT MOMENT \nTHE JOKER reaches into a big sack and begins distributing MINIATURE GAS MASKS, like party favors, to his cronies on the float. Then he pulls out a radio-operated REMOTE CONTROL DEVICE and points it up at the CLOWN BALLOON. \nHe hits a button. The CLOWN begins to INFLATE. Its joints bulge. Its FACE SWELLS UP as the COMPRESSOR TANK concealed inside it releases its noxious contents. The JOKER is BEAMING, a look of PURE UNALLOYED JOY on his face... \n... when his PARADE FLOAT BLOWS TO SMITHEREENS BENEATH HIM! The JOKER and his men CARTWHEEL THROUGH THE AIR and TUMBLE TO THE ASPHALT as THE BATWING WHIPS PAST OVERHEAD, soaring through the stone canyons of Gotham at a 90-degree angle to the ground! \nJOKER No... NOOOOO!!! \nANGLE ON CLOWN BALLOON \nas it rises, rises, swelling to grotesque proportions in the starless night. The tallest buildings are far below it now. Finally it BURSTS -- and the deadly GAS inside it disperses harmlessly in the wind. \nEXT. AVENUE - THAT MOMENT \nTHE JOKER on the edge of a tantrum as he digs amid the rubble of his float for the remote device. At last he finds it; aims it up at the other balloons in the procession; hits a button repeatedly... \n... and HOWLS IN FRUSTRATION. Nothing's happening. The damned thing is broken. He heaves it to the street in a fit of pique. \nA SCREAMING COMES ACROSS THE SKY as the BATWING swings back for another pass, BUZZING the JOKER at an altitude of twenty feet. SIZZLING LASER FIRE sweeps the street. \nCABLES SNAP and BALLOONS DRIFT UPWARD as BATMAN'S LASERS sever their moorings. The JOKER can only look on helplessly, in stunned disbelief. \nAs he's watching his plans evaporate... HIS EYES FALL ON THE MAKESHIFT BAT-SIGNAL. \nJOKER There. There. -- GET 'EM!! \nANGLE ON SPOTLIGHT TRUCK \nA SPRAY OF MACHINE-GUN FIRE shatters the Bat-signal. KNOX throws VICKI to the street, ducks down behind the spotlight, and tosses her his CAR KEYS. \nKNOX GET THE CAR! \nThe JOKER'S GOONS are coming up fast as VICKI reaches the Ford, starts it, and comes ROARING UP toward KNOX. He jumps off the truck as VICKI twists the wheel, lays a track of rubber, and noses the car back in the opposite direction. \nGUNFIRE as KNOX jumps inside and they PEEL OUT. \nINT. FORD ESCORT - MOVING - A MOMENT LATER \nKNOX's breathing is ragged, but he breaks out in HYSTERICAL LAUGHTER nonetheless. The two of them are totally exhilarated. They can't believe what they've just done. \nKNOX HOLY SHIT!! \nVICKI You okay? \nKNOX Yeah. Yeah. Little winded. DID YOU SEE THAT?! \nVICKI (laughing wildly) God yes, Allie. I've gotta say -- that was the ballsiest move I ever -- \nKNOX (ecstatic) Holy shit. Holy -- \nHe GURGLES. AN ENORMOUS GOUT OF BLOOD bubbles up between his lips -- and BURSTS. \nVICKI ALLIE!! \nHis hand goes to his stomach -- and comes away bloody. He looks down in genuine bewilderment. \nKNOX Jesus, Vicki. \nThat quickly, he's dead. VICKI lets out an awful wail and slams on the brakes. She sits there in the middle of the street, POUNDING THE WHEEL, TEARS pouring down her face. \nEXT. GOTHAM HARBOR - NIGHT \nIn the sky, CARTOON CHARACTERS drift lazily out to sea. \nEXT. BROAD AVENUE - NIGHT \nTHE JOKER and his boys running like hell down the avenue, past the parade. They reach the last of the floats -- the one bringing up the rear -- then CLIMB ABOARD and disappear through a CONCEALED HATCH. \nWOOD SPLINTERS as the top of the float begins to ROTATE mysteriously. The muzzle of a CANNON breaks through the parade decorations. And one moment later... \nA ROSE-COVERED TANK is rumbling up Broad Avenue! \nINT. BATWING - THAT MOMENT \nBATMAN sweeps past overhead. He sees the tank, unleashes a burst of LASER FIRE. It bounces harmlessly off the tank, leaves a trail of SMOKING ASPHALT on the street. He swoops low overhead, hits a button on his control panel as he streaks OVER THE TANK and into firing range. \nINT. TANK - THAT MOMENT \nTHE JOKER and his MEN clap hands to their ears as an EAR- SPLITTING ULTRASONIC SHRIEK reverberates in the tank. The JOKER screams out commands, to no avail. No one can hear him. He falls on the controls, begins hitting buttons. \nEXT. STREET - THAT MOMENT \n", "test1_input": "BRUCE Too much work. I'm not really the physical type. -- Thank you, Alfred. \nALFRED has just appeared from belowdecks with a tray of drinks for BRUCE and VICKI. VICKI watches as BRUCE reaches for his glass. His forearm looks like a thin layer of skin over braided telephone cables. \nVICKI You do a very convincing imitation. (sipping her drink) Mm, this is tasty. What's yours? \nHe smiles, slides the drink over toward her, gestures for her to try a sip. \nVICKI (cont.) ... Ginger ale? \nBRUCE Two drinks and I start swinging from the rooftops. (beat) Tell me, Vicki. There's something I'm very curious about. What took you down to Corto Maltese? \nVICKI ... I guess I needed a change. \nBRUCE You were one of the most successful magazine photographers in the city. Everyone wanted you. \nVICKI Have you ever been to Corto Maltese? \nBRUCE Not since the shooting started. \nVICKI We went there once when I was little. I played on the beach. And at nights -- they had a band -- I danced with my father on the hotel patio. (shrugging) That was Corto Maltese. When the war broke out I had to go back. And I promised myself that this time... I wouldn't look away. \nBRUCE What did you see? \nVICKI ... Terror. \nThe conversation is getting rather intense -- at both ends. VICKI seems to have hit some weird chord within BRUCE. \nBRUCE There's terror everywhere. Some types are just more -- familiar than others. \nFor a moment BRUCE seems to be drifting back into his familiar 'preoccupied' mode. VICKI laughs apologetically. \nVICKI I'm sorry. I didn't mean to -- I know it all seems a million miles away, out here on the water, with all this -- \nBRUCE Insulation? \nVICKI is momentarily stuck for a reply. In some way she can't quite grasp, he seems to be challenging her. \nVICKI Bruce, really, when I say these things I don't mean to criticize you. \nBRUCE I think you see things very clearly. \nVICKI I'm happy to talk about something else. I don't want to be depressing. \nBRUCE (smiling) Do you assume that if I know you better I won't like you as much? \nVICKI starts laughing. BRUCE is a notorious womanizer, but if this is a come-on, it's like no come-on she's ever seen. \nVICKI I'm sorry, Bruce, I have to ask. Are you like this with the other women you know? -- Because I just can't seem to get a handle on this conversation. \nBRUCE (taking her hand) Vicki, if I say anything cryptic, or... ambiguous, I think you should put the most flattering possible interpretation on it. Because even if it doesn't sound that way... that's how I'll mean it. \nBingo. The guy's a chessplayer, but on the other hand he's also rather touchingly, almost childishly, sincere. Before she knows it, VICKI finds herself melting. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GOTHAM CITY OPERA HOUSE - NIGHT \nRigoletto. THE DUKE onstage, launching into his big crowd-pleaser, \"La Donna e Mobile.\" \nWE PAN THE AUDIENCE, finding several mobile young DONNAS in the crowd -- drop-dead beauties in slinky gowns. Although most eyes are fixed, reasonably enough, on the stage, DONNA #1 is staring with undisguised envy at a PRIVATE BOX above the orchestra seats. Her mouth twists in disgust. \nShe scans the crowd, finds her counterpart (DONNA #2) some rows back, on the arm of a bald bigwig. DONNA #2 is wearing a similar sour expression, staring up at the same box. \nDONNA #3 is even less discreet than her comrades. She has her opera glasses trained on the couple in the box. \nHER POV - THROUGH OPERA GLASSES - THE BOX \nBRUCE and VICKI. He whispers in her ear. She smiles and whispers back. \nA beat. He whispers again. This time she doesn't laugh. But her lips part slightly. SCREEN GOES BLACK as the opera glasses SNAP SHUT. \nANGLE ON CROWD - DONNA #3 \nstaring icily at the DUKE as he finishes up to a round of TUMULTUOUS APPLAUSE. \nCUT TO: \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - NIGHT \nBRUCE and VICKI enter. He takes her coat, drops it on a chair by the door. VICKI is giddy, all champagned up. \nVICKI -- but it's not fair. I'm half drunk and you're not even -- \nBRUCE Would you like me to take you home? \nVICKI God. You would. (sidling up to him) Come on, Bruce. I just want to get two drinks in you. As an experiment. \nBRUCE Maybe we should just kiss. \nVICKI ... We could try that. \nWIDER ANGLE \nBRUCE embracing VICKI in the vastness of the darkened entry hall, framed by long semicircular STAIRWAYS on opposite walls. A SUDDEN FLASH OF LIGHTNING transports us to: \n", "test1_true": "Broken windows, graffiti on the walls: a decrepit rathole near the Gotham docks. \nINT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nTIGHT ON a face swathed in bandages. The patient sits erect in a wooden chair, surrounded by the grimy paraphernalia of an unlicensed gangland doctor. \nThe DOCTOR, a nervous little ferret with the bedside manner of a back-alley abortionist, steps up with a scissors. \nDOCTOR Well, Mr. Napier, let's see how we did. \nHe begins to snip away. As the bandages come off, we get: \nJACK NAPIER'S POV \nThe last strands of gauze peel away. The DOCTOR stands there, looking at his handiwork. His mouth falls open. His eyes bug out. He GAGS. \nJACK (V.O.) Mirror. \nThe DOCTOR just stands there staring AT CAMERA, stock- still, apparently transfixed by the sight of JACK's face. \nJACK (V.O.) Mirror. \nANGLE ON DOCTOR \nHe clears his throat, reaches apprehensively for a hand mirror, and passes it out of frame to JACK. Two beats. Then, the sound of GLASS SHATTERING as the mirror drops to the floor. \nJACK begins to laugh. THE DOCTOR gets a little edgy. \nDOCTOR You understand the facial muscles were completely severed -- \nJACK keeps on laughing. \nThe DOCTOR turns uneasily away, gestures apologetically at his seedy equipment. \nDOCTOR (cont.) -- you can see what I have to work with here -- \nMORE LAUGHTER. The trembling DOCTOR covers his face with one hand, whining now, not daring to look at JACK. \nDOCTOR (cont.) I'm sure that with proper recon-- recon-- reconstructive surgery -- \nA DOOR SLAMS. JACK is gone. The grateful DOCTOR breathes a sigh of relief and steadies himself on an operating table. \nEXT. OFFICE BUILDING - OVERHEAD ANGLE - NIGHT \nFrom a point high above we see JACK emerging into the alley, pulling on a hat, wrapping a muffler about his head. We can't see his face. But we can't forget his LAUGH. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BRUCE WAYNE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nVICKI nestled peacefully under the covers. Beside her is BRUCE: hands behind his head, staring up at the ceiling. \nIt's almost as though BRUCE is not used to sleeping at night. He doesn't know what to do with himself. \nHe looks at VICKI. She's terribly lovely. But despite all that, we can't shake the feeling that BRUCE... would really rather be somewhere else. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nLOUD MUSIC. KIDS in punk regalia stand outside a rock club as JACK stalks past. The wind knocks his hat off. \nKID Nice hair, dude! \nJACK ignores them as he bends to retrieve his hat. Then he gazes up at the steel-and-glass facade of a SKYSCRAPER -- and strides deliberately across the street. \nINT. GRISSOM'S PENTHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe spectacular Gotham skyline, seen through the plate- glass window of GRISSOM's conference room. The doors to the private elevator hiss open and JACK wanders in. He plops in the big plush swivel chair behind GRISSOM's desk. \nGRISSOM (O.S.) That you, sugar bumps? \nGRISSOM waddles in unsuspectingly from the adjoining room. He's fresh out of the shower, a towel wrapped around his impressive girth. He's using a smaller towel to dry his hair, and so it's a moment before he sees the bundled-up figure at his desk. \nGRISSOM (cont.)

I heard you'd been -- \nJACK (standing up) Is that what you \"heard\"? \nJACK gestures him over to the empty chair. GRISSOM doesn't move until he sees the GUN pointed at his belly. \nJACK (cont.) YOU SET ME UP! (beat) Over a girl. You must be insane! \nGRISSOM surreptitiously reaches for a desk drawer. \nJACK (cont.) Keep your hands on the desk. \nGRISSOM Sooner or later you would've tried to take me, Jack. You may get me now, but your life won't be worth a dime. \nJACK I've died once already. It wasn't so bad. -- In fact I recommend it. \nGRISSOM is beginning to panic now. It's obvious that JACK is utterly, hopelessly deranged. \n", "test1_id": 840, "test2_input": "VICKI Then \"everyone\" must know something I don't. \nCLAIRE (cattily) Oh. Really. Well. -- Come on, dear, Tony's dying to see you. \nIn a corner of the studio, TONY, a gaunt, tubercular Brit, is shooting a swimsuit layout with two SUPERMODELS. They all ad lib greetings to VICKI as TONY darts around hyperkinetically, snapping the girls in a series of poses. \nTONY Yes, ladies, smiles, show me those smiles, fabulous, tropical smiles, think Tahiti, I want to see teeth, yes, those glorious teeth -- \nAs VICKI looks on, the SUPERMODELS freeze in place simultaneously, a strange, STRICKEN LOOK on their faces. \nTONY (cont.) My God no, don't stop now, those smiles, I need those smiles -- \nSuddenly the girls are LAUGHING -- but the laughter is unnatural, involuntary. VICKI, sensing that something is terribly wrong, lays a hand on CLAIRE's arm. \nThe MODELS, now wearing HUGE SMILES, begin to TWITCH SPASMODICALLY. TONY snaps away. \nTONY (cont.) Yes! Oh baby, YES! That's -- (beat) No! Too far, too far! Pull back, pull back!

Behind them, BLOWUPS of the two dead SUPERMODELS. \nPATSY The fashion world was stunned today by the sudden deaths of top models Kelly Brinkley and Christie Emberg. Cause of death has been attributed to a violent allergic reaction, although authorities have not yet ruled out the possibility of drug use. Dave? \nBehind DAVE, on the bluescreen: a HUGE STATUE, covered in canvas -- not unlike New York's Statue of Liberty. \nDAVE In Gotham, plans continue for the city's 300th birthday celebration. The four-day event will conclude with the unveiling, in Gotham Harbor, of the newly restored 'Lady Gotham'... \nA TECHNICIAN'S HAND passes a slip of paper into frame. \nDAVE (cont.)

PATSY spins like a dervish and LURCHES BACKWARD over the newsdesk in a death spasm, giving us a quick look at the grisly Joker's grin etched on her now-lifeless face. \nDAVE gestures frantically to the cameraman: \nDAVE (cont.) KILL THE CAMERA!! KILL THE -- \nSuddenly, CRACKLING VIDEO STATIC wipes out the screen. A moment later, we're looking at: \nSPLITSCREEN CLOSEUP - THE SUPERMODELS \nTheir gorgeous faces sprout BIG, ANIMATED-CARTOON GRINS as a BOUNCY TUNE -- \"Put on a Happy Face\" -- comes up underneath. \nMODELS (CARTOON VOICE) ... Love that Joker! \nINT. SUPERMARKET - DAY \nTHEME MUSIC CONTINUES as a grinning, deranged pitchman -- THE JOKER -- pushes his shopping cart down the aisle. The shelves are filled with products bearing his TRADEMARK HARLEQUIN'S FACE. He waves merrily in time to the music. \nINT. STUDIO - VIDEO CONTROL BOOTH - THAT MOMENT \nPANICKED TECHNICIANS swarm the booth. The studio feed has been JAMMED. Every monitor shows THE JOKER'S COMMERCIAL. \nDIRECTOR WHERE'S IT COMING FROM?? \nTECHNICIAN I DON'T KNOW! \nCLOSEUP - THE JOKER \nJOKER ... new improved Joker brand. With the secret ingredient... SMYLENOL! (a sweep of the hand) Let's go to our blind taste test. \nTIGHT ON an anonymous MAN -- GAGGED AND BLINDFOLDED, tied to his chair, squirming, struggling. On the table before him is a package labelled \"BRAND X.\" A SUPERIMPOSED TITLE reads: \"NOT AN ACTOR.\" \nJOKER (cont.) Ooh. He's tense. Irritable. Out of sorts. (wagging a finger) He's been using Brand X! But with new improved Joker brand... \nANGLE WIDENS to include a BLINDFOLDED CORPSE, limp in his chair, GRINNING HORRIFICALLY. \nJOKER (cont.) ... it's a SMILE EVERY TIME!! \nEXT. IDYLLIC PASTORAL SETTING - DAY \nTHE JOKER in a field of wheat. On a picnic blanket before him are TWO CLEAN-CUT MODELS -- one male, one female, BOTH DEAD... and GRIMACING HORRIBLY. \nJOKER (cont.) -- and the world smiles with you! Irresistable -- oh-so-kissable -- \nHe grabs the dead MODELS by the hair. THEIR TEETH CLINK as he forces their heads together for a post-mortem kiss. \nSERIES OF SHOTS \nTelevision sets all over Gotham, as startled citizens react to the JOKER's maniacal promo. \nJOKER I know what you're saying.

They dig in automatically, then FREEZE with their forks in midair. \n-    A MIDDLE-AGED MATRON at the living-room TV. Shocked, she calls to her husband -- and gets no reply. We FOLLOW HER to the bathroom door. \nOn the floor she sees AN OVERTURNED SHAMPOO BOTTLE. Then: her HUSBAND, slumped down in the tub, a lethal GRIN on his face. She lets out a SHRIEK. \nINT.

A GLOVED HAND reaches for a pay phone. \nVOICE She's outside the Fluegelheim. \nINT. ALICIA HUNT'S PENTHOUSE - THAT MOMENT \nA BONE-WHITE HAND slams a phone receiver down. THE JOKER is at his vanity. He's rinsed his hair black. He's applying pounds of pancake makeup to his bleached face, his puckered cheeks. In the right light he could almost pass for human. \nIn all the city, he's the only person still using cosmetics. \nA DREAMY, DRUGGED VOICE intrudes: \nALICIA Jack? Who was that? \nAs he looks up at the mirror, we get a quick glimpse of ALICIA behind him. The voice, the long blonde hair, are unmistakable. But for some reason, ALICIA'S FACE is COVERED... by a SHINY WHITE PORCELAIN DOLL'S MASK. \nJOKER Get dressed. We're going out. \nINT. FLUEGELHEIM MUSEUM - EVENING \nA Gotham landmark, the Fluegelheim looks like something Frank Lloyd Wright would've dreamed up -- a large open atrium encircled by a stucco RAMP, which spirals up along the interior walls to the CEILING four stories above. You walk up this gently-inclined ramp to view the paintings. \nINT. FLUEGELHEIM - ROOFTOP TEA ROOM - EVENING \nThe upper terminus of the ramp opens on an airy, fern- filled dining room popular with tourists and elderly matrons who work up an appetite looking at art. VICKI enters, camera bag slung over one shoulder, portfolio in hand. \nVICKI I'm meeting Mr. Wayne. Is he here? \nMAITRE D' No, but your table is ready. \nINT. TEA ROOM - TWENTY MINUTES LATER - EVENING \nVICKI, sipping on a gin and tonic, checks her watch. A WAITER brings her a small parcel, wrapped in brown paper, bearing a single word: URGENT. \nWAITER Miss Vale, this just arrived for you. \nAs the WAITER leaves, she tears off the wrapper. Inside is a small white box and a NOTE -- SCRIBBLED IN CRAYON. \nDEAR V. VALE, PUT THIS ON RIGHT NOW. \nUnsigned, of course. VICKI, puzzled, opens the box to find a MINIATURE GAS MASK. \n", "test2_id": 841, "test3_input": "INT. CATHEDRAL - BELLTOWER - NIGHT \nA tiny stone chamber, 8'x8', open on four sides to the wind. The enormous church bell has long since been removed. \nThe JOKER stands in an archway, gazing at the gargoyles on the roof below. He hits a button on the walkie-talkie: \nJOKER I'm in the belltower. Don't land. \nINT. HELICOPTER - MOVING - NIGHT \nA PILOT replies through his radio headset. \nPILOT E.T.A. two minutes. Hang on. \nThe PILOT swings the copter right in a wide, swooping arc. \nINT. STAIRWAY TO BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nBATMAN. Broken, beaten, his right leg useless, he hauls himself up the steps one at a time. He should be dead. Dried blood cakes his face, his chest. \nDizzy, exhausted, his body strained to the limit, he slumps against a wall to steady himself, then reaches into his utility belt for a painkiller -- and forces the capsule back onto his dry, swollen tongue. \nQuaking all over, he tries to draw himself erect... and TOPPLES OVER, landing with his full weight on the rotten wood of the belltower stairs. \nTHE STAIRWAY COLLAPSES, turning to splinters beneath him. And suddenly BATMAN finds himself DANGLING PRECARIOUSLY IN MIDAIR, hanging by one hand to an upper step. \nIt would be so much easier to let go. He looks down at the fragments of the shattered stairway, STILL FALLING, vanishing into the dark depths of the stairwell. \nThen he looks up. At the trapdoor. A mere six feet away. His TEETH CLENCH in a monstrous grimace. AND WITH AN INHUMAN EFFORT, HE HOISTS HIMSELF UP ONTO THE UPPER STEPS. \nFor a full five seconds he's blind with pain. A RAGGED WOODEN SHAFT is buried in his right shoulder. Twitching, trembling, he reaches up and YANKS IT OUT with his last ounce of strength. \nThe trapdoor is a foot above his head. It could be a mile. BATMAN finally realizes he's not going to make it. \nHe reaches down and rips open a Velcro seal on his utility belt, revealing the strange TIMER DEVICE we saw him making earlier. Before he can activate it his hand falls limply at his side. \nTHE BATMAN is out like a light. \nINT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nThe JOKER glances casually down at the trapdoor, wondering what all the noise is about. He draws his gun, moves cautiously to the trapdoor, and lifts it a few inches... just enough to see the unconscious form on the stairs. \nJOKER ... Batman? \nNo reply. The JOKER stands there and lets out a little snicker. He looks out through the archway, sees no sign of his rescue copter. Then -- a look of curious amusement on his face -- he steps down THROUGH THE TRAPDOOR and LUGS BATMAN up into the belltower. \nHe props BATMAN up against a wall. Still no sign of life. The JOKER crouches beside him and -- almost tenderly -- pats his face. \nJOKER (cont.) Batman? Batman? \nTHE BATMAN's lips part. But he's too weak to speak. \nJOKER (cont.) I thought you'd be more comfortable here in the belfry. (chuckling to himself) Before I kill you I'd like to see who you are. Would that be okay? \nBATMAN emits a tiny low moan. The JOKER takes it as a yes and reaches over to undo his cowl. \nBRUCE WAYNE stares up with dulled, sightless eyes. The JOKER reaches into his pocket for a purple handkerchief, moistens it, dabs at the caked blood on BRUCE's face. \nJOKER (cont.) Oh my, aren't we pretty. (brightening suddenly) I know you! You're the rich boy!! \nThe JOKER is enormously tickled by this discovery. He claps his hands together in sheer glee. \nJOKER (cont.) My goodness, what in the world made you do it? It must've been something pretty terrible! \nHe's practically dancing now. He's made a friend. \nJOKER (cont.) You know, we should've sat down and had us a little heart-to-heart. I bet we would have got on famously. \nBATMAN Mad... man... \nJOKER Well now, you're not exactly the picture of mental health, are you. \nBATMAN ... Murderer... \nJOKER Bruce, we're both murderers. Think how many people you've killed by letting me live. \nA SPOTLIGHT cuts through the night sky. The JOKER hears his helicopter approaching in the distance. \nBRUCE reaches down furtively. Finds the timer on his utility belt. FLICKS A SWITCH... and the countdown begins. \nThe JOKER pulls a straight razor from his pocket and opens it gingerly. \nJOKER (cont.) I have to do it now, Bruce, but it won't even hurt. Now relax. The bat's in his belfry, all's right with the world... \nHe has the razor almost up to BRUCE's throat when BRUCE reaches out and GRABS HIS LAPELS in a death grip. The JOKER is momentarily amused by this seeming display of affection. \nJOKER (cont.) Why, Bruce... \nThen he hears ticking. \nLooks down at the flashing digital display on BRUCE's belt. 0:26 seconds. 0:25 seconds. \nHe SHRIEKS HORRIFICALLY and DROPS THE RAZOR. \nBRUCE won't let go of him. Finally he manages to lurch convulsively away, sprawling on the floor of the belfry. \n", "test3_true": "JOKER (cont.) IT'S NOT FUNNY!!! \nBRUCE No... sense... of humor? \nThe JOKER reaches out for the ticking time bomb. Thinks better of it and retracts his shaking hand. \nHe can see the copter approaching now, slicing through the clouds. He screams, waves a flashlight in the air: his signal beacon. 0:20 and counting. \nThe JOKER scans the belltower frantically. His eyes fall on the trapdoor. He races over, flings it open, starts down the stairs in a frenzy. \nThere are no stairs. They've collapsed. 0:16 and counting. \nScreaming insanely, the JOKER vaults through the door and makes for the open stone archway. The copter is directly overhead now. A rope ladder drops from its belly. \nEXT. BELLTOWER - THAT MOMENT \nThe helicopter descends, its whirling blades stirring up a windstorm on the roof of the old abandoned cathedral. DEAD LEAVES rise and swirl in the churning air. \nINT. BELLTOWER \nThe JOKER makes a futile grab at the rope ladder, almost losing his purchase on the archway parapet. He gestures wildly for the copter to make another pass. 0:12 to go. \nEXT. BELLTOWER \nA maelstrom of swirling leaves. And now, among the leaves -- roused from their resting place in the rotten rafters of the old cathedral -- \n-- A HORDE OF SQUEALING, CHITTERING BATS!! Filling the air like a black cloud, HUNDREDS OF THEM, taking flight in blind uncomprehending fury -- \nINT. BELLTOWER \nThe JOKER leaps into empty space, grabs hold of the ladder, cackles in mad triumph -- \n-- AND SUDDENLY THE BELLTOWER IS FULL OF BATS. A SCREECHING SWARM, HIDEOUS, BLACK-WINGED -- SWOOPING THROUGH THE ARCHWAYS DIRECTLY AT THE JOKER -- \n-- WHO SCREAMS IN TERROR -- LETS GO OF THE LADDER -- \n-- and plunges into the night. \nTIGHT ON BATMAN. Six seconds remain. There is still time if he makes his choice now. \nSurrounded by the flapping of leathery wings, his body working on pure adrenalin, he unbuckles the belt. Lurches into position. Heaves it out into the darkness. \nIt snags on the bottom rung of the dangling rope ladder. \nINT. HELICOPTER - POV CO-PILOT \nThe CO-PILOT is hanging out one side of the copter, just enough to see what's going on. \nCO-PILOT PULL UP!! PULL -- \nEXT. CHURCHYARD - OVERHEAD ANGLE \nIt's as if time has stopped. The world has grown suddenly silent. We're looking down at the JOKER, whose body lies splayed and broken on the flagstone surface of the churchyard. Slowly, elegantly -- we have all the time in the world, now -- we DRIFT DOWNWARD, closer, until his FACE FILLS THE SCREEN, the familiar chilling grin still intact. \nSad clown, A-one crazy boy, staring aimlessly at the stars. Suddenly his face is bathed in a brilliant gasoline GLOW. \nPOV JOKER \nLooking up he sees a beautiful display of fireworks, bursting and burning, spirals of color snaking through the sky as the helicopter explodes in eerie silence. \nREVERSE ANGLE - THE JOKER'S FACE \nIt's all so lovely. The JOKER's expression is happy, almost childlike, as he gazes up at this private show. Gradually, though, the bright colors fade; and the JOKER's face begins to relax, the twisted grin dissolving at last as darkness sets in. \nFADE THROUGH TO: \nINT. TELEVISION STUDIO - NIGHT \nAN ANCHORWOMAN delivering an oncamera EDITORIAL. \nANCHORWOMAN As the details of the Joker's heinous plan become known, a city's gratitude goes out to the mysterious Batman. His whereabouts remain unknown, but Batman -- if you're alive -- if you're listening -- thank you. \nEXT. CEMETERY - DAY \nVICKI at a fresh gravesite. She places a FLORAL ARRANGEMENT in the urn at the head of the grave; stands back to examine it; then bends once more to reposition the drooping flowers. \nVICKI I loved you too. \nAs soon as the words come out, she begins to CRY. Then she gets hold of herself; rises; turns up her collar; and goes. \nThe headstone reads: \"ALEXANDER KNOX, 1956-1987.\" \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - STUDY - DAY \nALFRED, in his apron, on the phone. \nALFRED No, Mr. Wayne is in Thailand. I'm afraid he's quite unreachable. \nINT. WAYNE MANOR - DAY \nThe glass-enclosed room which houses BRUCE's Olympic-sized SWIMMING POOL. Outside, snow is falling. \nIn the pool, on an inflatable rubber raft, is BRUCE WAYNE. Beside him, waist-deep is the water, is VICKI -- helping him rehabilitate his leg and shoulder. \nVICKI I don't know why I'm doing this. I half wish you'd stay a cripple. \n", "test3_id": 842}

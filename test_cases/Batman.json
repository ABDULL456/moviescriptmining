{"test1_input": "Civic-minded politicos decked out in fund-raiser finery. They applaud DENT's tough talk wildly. They've just shelled out $500 a plate for a chicken dinner, and by God they're going to enjoy this. \nTuxedoed WAITERS move among the tables, deftly refilling water glasses. As they do, we SEE an EMPTY PLACE SETTING -- the only one in the hall. Some well-meaning moneybags has laid out half a grand and then neglected to show up. \nThe engraved placecard reads: BRUCE WAYNE. \nANGLE ON DENT \nDENT If elected, my first act as district attorney will be to return an indictment against Boss Carl Grissom! \nCUT TO: \nINT. APARTMENT - NIGHT \nA woman's apartment, decorated in pastel pinks and mauves. Original paintings and sculptures everywhere. The place reeks of money. \nIn the foreground: a MAN'S HAND, long, elegant, manicured. Manipulating a DECK OF CARDS, doing a one-handed shuffle with extraordinary finesse. \nIn the background: a TV set tuned to the 11 o'clock news, with highlights of HARVEY DENT's campaign speech. \nDENT (on the TV screen) Together we can make Gotham city a safe place for decent people to live and work and play. \nTHE HAND sets the deck on an end table, raps it twice, turns up four aces off the top. This most unusual deck sports a .22 calibre BULLET HOLE straight through the middle. \nJACK NAPIER Decent people shouldn't live here. They'd be much happier someplace else. \nJACK NAPIER, 32, is right-hand man and chief enforcer to Boss Carl Grissom. His features are delicate, almost feminine, and he takes a vain, gangsterish pride in his appearance. He is also absolutely merciless. \nHe trains a cold eye on DENT's televised image as ALICIA HUNT -- 26, beautiful, Carl Grissom's kept woman -- glides over in her negligee and snuggles up. \nALICIA Anything new? \nJACK The usual gas. If this clown could lay a hand on Grissom... I would've had to kill him by now. \nALICIA finds JACK's necktie draped over a nearby chair. She begins knotting it playfully about his neck. \nALICIA If Grissom knew about us... he might kill you. \nJACK seems uninterested in her affections. His eye darts back and forth between the TV and his own reflection in a nearby vanity. \nJACK Don't think so, angel. I'm too valuable. That's the way I've planned it. (pause) And besides, he doesn't know. \nJACK checks his watch, reaches for his topcoat, and stands in front of the vanity. He runs a hand through sculpted hair, checks out his Albert Nipon ensemble. \nALICIA You look just fine, Jack. \nHe smiles at himself before turning to the door. \nJACK ... I didn't ask. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT \nThe scene of the earlier mugging, a half-block off Gotham Square. Only now, the deserted alleyway is a beehive of activity: police cars, an ambulance, a forensics van. \nEDDIE THE PUNK goes past on a stretcher, catatonic. Watching him are a porcine cop, LT. ECKHARDT, and a POLICE MEDIC. \nMEDIC That one there won't say a word. The other one's raving his head off. \nECKHARDT Variety, huh? The spice of life. \nAt the mouth of the alley, we find ALEXANDER KNOX -- thirty, hyperactive, a crime reporter for the Gotham Gazette. At the moment, he's chatting with a uniformed PATROLMAN. \nPATROLMAN They found him hugging a drainpipe. He was scared to come off the roof. \nKNOX Great, but tell me: is this another you-know-what? 'Cause if so, it's the third one this week. \nPATROLMAN (testily) I dunno. What's \"what\"? \nKNOX Good answer. I'm gonna put you in for a commendation. \nKNOX spots ECKHARDT and the MEDIC, waves cheerily, and saunters down the alley. ECKHARDT curses under his breath. \nECKHARDT Oh Christ, it's Knox. \nKNOX Hiya, gents. This anything I should know about? \nECKHARDT Nothing out of the routine. \nAt this exact moment two uniformed PATROLMEN drag a brain- fried NICK past the mouth of the alley. \nNICK A bat, I tell you, a giant bat! He wanted me to do him a favor...! \nKNOX tilts one eyebrow. ECKHARDT and the MEDIC trade disgusted looks. \nKNOX No offense, boys, but these guys are seeing something up there. \nECKHARDT No comment. Print what you like. \nKNOX Come on. One question. Is there a six-foot bat in Gotham City? \nKNOX's tone is jokey, but only half-jokey. ECKHARDT snorts in disgust and turns away. KNOX shouts after him: \nKNOX (cont.) If so, is he on the police payroll? If so, what's he pulling down after taxes? \n", "test1_true": "We pick up LT. ECKHARDT as he emerges onto the side street. He's headed for his car when he spies a STRETCH LIMO idling across the street. Leaning on the hood, waving hi, is the dandyish JACK NAPIER -- flanked by two impressive GOONS. \nECKHARDT throws a nervous glance back in KNOX's direction. He turns left, gestures to JACK to meet him farther up the block. By the time he reaches the corner JACK has swaggered up alongside him. \nECKHARDT takes a fat brown envelope from JACK and stuffs it quickly in his coat. \nJACK You didn't show up. \nECKHARDT We had another bat sighting. \nJACK I'm sure that was vitally important. Listen: things are heating up. Someone is leaking information to Harvey Dent. \nECKHARDT bristles. There's no love lost between these two. \nECKHARDT I'm doing the best I can. If it's a problem -- \nJACK Eckhardt... our problems are your problems. \nECKHARDT I'll work on it. \nJACK reaches out and grabs ECKHARDT by the lapels of his topcoat -- an Italian job, obviously expensive. He rubs the material between his fingers. \nJACK Very nice, Lieutenant. But a little ostentatious on a cop's salary, don't you think? \nECKHARDT (knocking his hands away) I answer to Grissom, punk. Not to you. \nJACK You're a smart boy, Eckhardt. You should be thinking about the future. \nECKHARDT laughs in his face. \nECKHARDT Ambition. (nodding his head) Forget it, Jack. You'll never run that organization. \nJACK And why's that? \nECKHARDT You're a psycho, friend. You're an A-one crazy boy and Grissom knows it. \nJACK lashes out and BACKHANDS ECKHARDT across the face. The fat cop, stunned, turns bright red and CHARGES JACK. \nJACK claps a hand on ECKHARDT's face and shoves him back full-force. The cop sprawls on his ass in the doorway of an all-night Cuban-Chinese restaurant. \nBy now PATRONS are staring out of the restaurant windows. ECKHARDT is livid. His hand goes instinctively to his gun. \nJACK Here. Use mine. \nJACK pulls an automatic from his pocket and tosses it in ECKHARDT's lap. He looks down and laughs, daring ECKHARDT to pick it up -- just as the two enormous GOONS from the stretch limo appear behind him for reinforcement. \nECKHARDT wipes blood from his mouth as JACK -- an A-one crazy-boy grin on his face -- reaches down for the gun. \nJACK (cont.) It's all right, boys. Lt. Eckhardt here is a good cop. A real good cop. (pause; smiling) Inexpensive. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. GOTHAM GLOBE - CITY ROOM - DAY \nGotham city's leading tabloid daily. COPY BOYS rush to and fro; REPORTERS pound out articles on computer terminals. ALEXANDER KNOX saunters in, a sheath of typed pages in his hand, and pauses at a CARTOONIST's drawing table. \nKNOX What have you got for me, Jerry? \nJERRY holds up a cartoon: a HUMAN BAT, with an awful, fanged rodent's face, wearing a business suit. The caption at the top reads: \"HAVE YOU SEEN THIS MAN?\"  KNOX nods in approval. \nKNOX (cont.) Nice, but... maybe a little more gore on the fangs, huh? \nHe pats JERRY on the shoulder, moves on. A BESPECTACLED COLLEAGUE spots him and calls out: \nCOLLEAGUE Hey Knox, you got a visitor. \nKNOX I'm real busy, Clark. Be a pal and dust him, okay? \nCOLLEAGUE This one you might want to dust yourself. \nCuriosity piqued, KNOX moves toward his desk... and stops in his tracks. Propped up on the desk are a PAIR OF LEGS. The legs -- exceptionally nice ones -- are attached to a WOMAN leaning back in KNOX's swivel chair, taking a nap, her face obscured by a big outrageous hat. \nKNOX ... Vicki Vale. \nThe hat tips back. VICKI VALE, her face framed by a shock of bright red hair, flashes a dazzling smile. She pulls KNOX over for a quick smooch and laughs. \nVICKI How'd you know it was me? \nKNOX Honey -- I would know any randomly selected square inch of Vicki Vale. (grinning) If I had a good enough hint. \nHe points at the oversized CAMERA BAG on his desk. It bears the monogram \"V.V.\"  VICKI catches on, makes a face at him. \nKNOX (cont.) Where the hell have you been? \nVICKI A nice, restful vacation. \nShe reaches into the camera bag and pulls out a stack of glossy 8x10's: COMBAT PHOTOS from some unspecified war-torn corner of the world. KNOX leafs though them, impressed. \nKNOX God, a girl could get hurt doing this. \nVICKI I do get hurt. \nShe unbuttons her sleeve, rolls it back to show KNOX a long fresh scar on the inside of her arm. He winces -- then points to the scar and adds, slyly: \nKNOX Got any more of those? \n", "test1_id": 840, "test2_input": "GOON I Who cares? Wax that freak. \nThey turn their attention to BRUCE. A GLOVED HAND snakes out with lightning speed -- GRABBING GOON I BY THE COATTAIL and pulling him DIRECTLY INTO THE LINE OF FIRE. GOON II bas pulled the trigger twice before he knows what's happened. \nIn one fluid motion BRUCE HEAVES GOON I's lifeless body THROUGH THE AIR, knocking GOON II backward over a garbage can. GOON II falls and CRACKS HIS HEAD on the nearest wall. \nGOON III takes a rabbit punch to the throat. He's on the way down when he catches a STEEL-TOED BOOT in the gut. \nFour seconds after all this began, BRUCE is alone in the alleyway with GOON IV. GOON IV has his gun pointed right at BRUCE, but he's shaking too much to pull the trigger. \nBRUCE smiles. GOON IV SCREAMS and RUNS FOR HIS LIFE. \nThrough all this, VICKI's telephoto camera has been poised on the ledge, snapping away. BRUCE looks up at the FLASH GUN and shakes his head. He bends to retrieve his cowl. \nON VICKI \nShe finally dares to peek down at the alley. Limp goons everywhere. And, in addition, THE BATMAN -- leaping up, grabbing the edge of a fire escape, climbing up to meet her. \nVICKI thinks fast. She may have a clean shot of BATMAN'S FACE. She advances the film in the camera and removes the roll, then drops it down her blouse. \nBut BATMAN is likely to want that roll. So she straightens her skirt and scurries across the roof, away from the alley. She should have a minute or so before be gets there. \nIt's a three-foot drop to the next roof over. VICKI clambers down and quickens her pace, tossing a nervous glance over her shoulder every couple of steps. \nThen, somehow -- and she'll be damned if she can figure out how -- she walks smack into THE BATMAN. And GASPS. \nBATMAN ... Not even a 'thank you'? \nVICKI Well -- I think you might consider thanking me. You were good as dead. \nBATMAN That's because you lied about your weight. (a long pause) Thank you. \nVICKI NODS and tries to walk past him. He grabs her arm. \nBATMAN (cont.) I'll have to ask you for that film. \nVICKI I just wanted to distract them. I wasn't trying to get a picture of you. \nBATMAN looks down at the camera hanging from her neck. The telephoto lens must jut out six inches. VICKI gulps. \nBATMAN Please. \nVICKI I won't let you have it. \nTHE BATMAN is amused. He smiles menacingly. \nVICKI (cont.) I know you can break my neck and take it. But the Joker's on that same roll. I -- \nBATMAN The Joker is a murderer. And you were as good as dead. So -- \nVICKI Look, I appreciate what you did for me. But this is my job. And I'm keeping those pictures. \nBATMAN All right, here's a compromise. I'll develop the photos. You keep the Jokers and I'll keep the rest. \nVICKI How do I know you won't keep them all? \nBATMAN Because I'll take you with me. \nHe reaches out, holds her gently by the shoulders. His voice is deep and soothing. True, VICKI is a little dizzy from all that's happened, but she's undeniably drawn to him. \nStill cautious, though. She reaches into her bag and hands over a roll of film. The original roll -- not the telephoto shots, which are still stashed in her blouse. \nBATMAN (cont.) Thank you, Vicki. \nVICKI ... Where are you going to take me? \nNo reply. She looks up into his mirrored eyes. He pulls her closer to him. Brushes back her hair, runs one hand delicately along the line of her cheek... \n... AND BREAKS A TINY CAPSULE under her nose. VICKI SLUMPS into BATMAN's arms. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT \nStreet level. BATMAN emerges carrying VICKI's inert form in his arms. He pauses and peers around the edge of a wall at the BATMOBILE two blocks down. \nThe car is still there, the chrome-steel shields intact. But DOZENS OF COPS and CURIOSITY-SEEKERS are SWARMING ALL OVER the fearsome machine. \nBATMAN snorts in frustration. AN ENORMOUS THREE-TON CATERPILLAR WINCH rumbles up the street toward the Batmobile. \nHe's about to get towed. BATMAN takes a RADIO TRANSMITTER from his utility belt and SPEAKS INTO IT. \nBATMAN Shields open. \nEXT. STREET - ON BATMOBILE \nTWO COPS are crawling along the hood of the car. From within they hear the tinny computerized voice: \nCOMPUTER Shields open. \nThe steel plates begin to retract. \nBATMAN (V.O.) (over radio) Ignition. \nCOMPUTER Ignition. \n", "test2_true": "COP There's somebody in there! \nThey TUMBLE OFF THE HOOD as the turbine engines ROAR TO LIFE and THE BATMOBILE BEGINS TO MOVE. \nCOPS AND ONLOOKERS quickly clear a path. They stand there stunned as the futuristic auto PICKS UP SPEED and advances toward the end of the block. The LEFT TURN SIGNAL flashes dutifully. And the BATMOBILE VANISHES AROUND THE CORNER. \nPANDEMONIUM BREAKS LOOSE as the COPS bolt for their cars. \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nSIRENS WAIL. PASSERSBY STARE SLACKJAWED at the driverless BATMOBILE as it tears down the street, passing, darting, dodging buses and CUTTING OFF TAXIS -- all with a squad of COP CARS in hot pursuit. \nEXT. ALLEYWAY - NIGHT \nBATMAN sees the BATMOBILE rounding the corner and approaching on the straightaway. He takes VICKI in his arms and STEPS DIRECTLY INTO THE PATH OF THE ONRUSHING HEADLIGHTS. \nBATMAN STOP! \nBRAKES SQUEAL. The BATMOBILE stops one yard short of BATMAN and VICKI. A moment later BATMAN is AT THE WHEEL. \nSIRENS BUILD. LIGHTS FLASH. The COP CARS are now visible behind them. BATMAN floors the pedal; the Batmobile's powerful AFTERBURNERS kick in; and the hapless cops KILL THEIR SIRENS as BATMAN zooms off into the night at 140 mph. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. BACK ROAD - NIGHT \nA deserted stretch of road, lined by ancient tall pines on either side. The BATMOBILE roars past. \nINT. BATMOBILE - NIGHT \nVICKI is gradually coming to on the passenger's side. \nVICKI ... How long have I been out? \nBATMAN Quite a while. I took the scenic route. \nVICKI (gazing around her) Well, I've certainly enjoyed it. What's that? \nHe's just hit a BUTTON on the dashboard. \nBATMAN Garage door. \nEXT. ROAD - THAT MOMENT - NIGHT \nAt the side of the road, a FALLEN TREE, surrounded by underbrush, RISES HYDRAULICALLY INTO THE AIR -- revealing a SECRET ROAD invisible from the main thoroughfare. \nDoing sixty, the BATMOBILE makes a hairpin turn. Seconds later, the FALLEN TREE drops back magically into place. \nINT. BATMOBILE - A MOMENT LATER - NIGHT \nAs they cruise down the hidden road, VICKI STUDIES BATMAN'S FACE. KNOX's words are very much on her mind. \nVICKI I meant to ask you. Up on the roof -- how did you know my name? \nBATMAN SMILES in response. VICKI smiles with him. \nVICKI (cont.) I'm serious. How did you know? \nNo reply. VICKI frowns, looks through the windshield, and SEES -- much to her horror -- an enormous SHEER CLIFF WALL LOOMING DEAD AHEAD. \nWide-eyed, she looks at BATMAN. Still smiling, he HITS THE GAS -- SPEEDING UP. She lets out a SCREAM. \nANGLE ON CLIFF WALL \nOne second to impact. Suddenly the cliff wall VANISHES ALTOGETHER -- revealing, in its place, the GAPING MOUTH OF AN UNDERGROUND CAVERN. \nThe Batmobile zooms through. A moment later, the CLIFF WALL -- which is nothing more than a HOLOGRAPHIC PROJECTION -- winks back into existence, showing no trace of the cavern. \nINT. BATCAVE - NIGHT \nWe all know this place. Although we haven't had time to acquire the familiar mementos -- the dinosaur, the giant penny -- the BATCAVE is unmistakable. Vast banks of blinking computers. A state-of-the-art crime lab. A fully- equipped workshop for hammering out new toys. It's the biggest and best secret clubhouse a boy could wish for. \nBATMAN climbs out of the car. He removes his cape, strips off his bullet-riddled jersey and his body armor. There are TWO BIG BRUISES on the center of his chest. \nVICKI looks on as he goes to a rack along one wall and picks out a fresh tunic -- one of four. She wanders over to examine the row of bat-suits -- and the BODY ARMOR. \nVICKI What is this stuff? Kevlar? \nBATMAN Better. It's not on the market yet. \nVICKI It doesn't protect your head, though. \nBATMAN That's why I wear a target on my chest. \nTHE BATMAN takes obvious pleasure in showing her his futuristic bachelor's pad. His tone is jokey, almost flirtatious. Behind the mask, he's a lot looser, more carefree, than some guys we could name... \n... like Bruce Wayne. \nVICKI is, to put it mildly, awed. She wanders around gaping at millions of dollars' worth of equipment. \nVICKI How'd you find this place? \nBATMAN Stumbled across it when I was a boy. \nVICKI'S HEAD jerks up abruptly. In the dim recesses overhead, BATS ARE SCREAMING. She shivers. \n", "test2_id": 841, "test3_input": "VICKI He has to tell someone. And I'm the one.

WAYNE FOUNDATION - DAY \nBRUCE in a plush office suite downtown, on the phone to his broker. Behind his desk is a big plate-glass window with a fortieth-floor view of the financial district, so he can wave at his fellow millionaires on their way down. \nBRUCE Don't sell. It won't last. We'll ride it out. \nWith exaggerated calm, he hangs up. He lifts the receiver to dial another number, then hesitates and hangs up again. \nINT. RECEPTION AREA - A MOMENT LATER - DAY \nBRUCE, affecting an air of nonchalance, strolls past a squad of SECRETARIES at desks. Phones are ringing off the hook. \nINT. HALLWAY - A MOMENT LATER - DAY \nBRUCE ambles past a couple of COLLEAGUES. One of them is shambling catatonically down the hall, bumping into walls. The other is WAILING HYSTERICALLY. \nWAILING COLLEAGUE ... a nine-million-dollar bath! \nBRUCE nods in sympathy as they pass. He stops outside the door to a men's room, looks around cautiously, then enters. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - A MOMENT LATER - DAY \nA small anteroom outside the bathroom proper, with a bank of PAY PHONES on one wall. BRUCE checks the bathroom to make sure it's empty, then digs out a quarter and dials a number. He cups one hand confidentially over the receiver: \nBRUCE (the familiar rasp) Vicki?... This is Batman. I thought I'd call and see how you're doing. \nINT. VICKI'S APARTMENT - DAY \nVICKI (hesitantly) ... I know it's you, Bruce. I'm not going to talk to you unless we can discuss it. \nINT.

We have to -- \nAt this very moment, a DAZED FINANCIER enters from behind. \nFINANCIER Hi, Bruce. \nBRUCE automatically claps a hand over the mouthpiece. His face goes slack as he hangs up -- with VICKI'S TINNY VOICE still squeaking on the other end of the line. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - NIGHT \nHARVEY DENT at a big desk, flanked by a number of POLITICOS. \nDENT ... We deal. \nADVISER Harvey, please. I mean -- (shaking his head) If your first official act as D.A. is to cut a deal with a terrorist... \nDENT Screw that, Ed. We've got a market panic of national proportions. -- We've got 786 people dead. (beat) I won't sacrifice one more life for the sake of appearing strong. \nPOLITICO Harvey's right. We've got the 300th anniversary gala coming up. The networks won't even send in a crew. \nADVISER Harvey, the police are working round the clock, the feds are coming in. This thing could break any minute now. (turning) Tell him, Jim. \nCOMMISSIONER GORDON reaches into his vest pocket for a cigar. He clips the end off, lights it, takes a long drag... and STARES GLUMLY at the floor. \nGORDON Cut the deal. \nINT.

Demands. Well, gents, this is kinda embarrassing, but... I'm having such a swell time, I just haven't thought any up. \nHe shrugs. STARTLED REACTIONS from the city officials. \nJOKER (cont.) But I'm a reasonable fella. If you want to make me an offer... \nPanicked, the MAYOR and co. go into a quick huddle. \nMAYOR All right, all right. Here's the deal.

ANDREWS ISLAND - DAY \nA tiny island in Gotham Harbor, homesite of LADY GOTHAM -- the huge, newly restored stone statue that welcomes incoming ships. Her upper half is draped in a huge TARP prior to the unveiling ceremony scheduled for this Sunday. \nAt the base of the statue, WORKMEN are assembling a big wooden platform, complete with microphones, amplifiers and spotlights. They raise a gigantic BANNER which reads: \"GOTHAM CITY -- 300TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION.\" \nCUT TO: \nEXT.

Gotham Globe. \nALFRED (V.O.) Mr. Wayne is out for the day. \nKNOX Actually, I wanted to talk to Batman. Pass that on to Mr. Wayne, would you? \nKNOX starts cockily off down the driveway -- then STOPS. Behind him, the iron gates are SLIDING OPEN. \nINT. BRUCE'S LIBRARY - TEN MINUTES LATER - DAY \nKNOX, agitated, drums his fingers on the edge of a big leather chair. BRUCE stands across from him. \nBRUCE I've been expecting to hear from you. \nKNOX Well, that's how it is, chum. She tells me everything. \nBRUCE What is it you want? \nKNOX Simple. You know the score. One column -- and I can bring all this tumbling down. I can take you off the streets once and for all. (a shaky pause) I want you to hang up the suit. And I want you to stay away from Vicki. \nBRUCE I can't do that. Not while the Joker's still out there. \nKNOX Then stay away from Vicki. That's all I want, man. I just want your word. \nBRUCE turns away, evading his gaze. KNOX fumbles in his jacket for a cigarette. \nKNOX (cont.) See, I don't know how it happened -- she's a smart girl and you are an extraordinarily screwed-up guy -- but she's in love with you. \nBRUCE There's something I don't understand. If you've got the story, why haven't you printed it? \nKNOX Because I -- (beat) Because she'd never speak to me again. \nKNOX is a bundle of nerves now. No longer cocky, he stubs out his newly-lit cigarette -- and begins to PLEAD OPENLY. \nKNOX (cont.) Come on, Bruce. Be straight. What have you got to offer? You gonna marry her? Batman and Mrs. Batman? (laughing bitterly) Gimme a break, huh? Who's gonna be Best Rodent? \nBRUCE sinks into a chair, exhales sharply. He can't even put up an argument.

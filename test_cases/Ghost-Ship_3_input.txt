A doll's white face, eyes haunting and coldly blue, stares into the middle distance. It lies on a love seat as Epps steps up. She lifts it. Several other toys lie scattered about as she studies it, when the sound of a TICKING CLOCK CAN BE HEARD. 
A beat as Epps holds there. She turns, trying to locate the sound. From across the room, Epps stands, listening. As the TICKING CLOCK sounds from here. She turns, putting down the doll, holding a beat. She approaches, crossing the room, coming finally to a stop before us and what we come to see is an ancient grandfather clock. 
All but it's minute hand has fallen off its corroded face, but from inside it emits a weak though steady TICKING. 
Epps stands there as the clock ticks, looking on, when the TICKING CEASES. A beat as she holds there, as the clock faces her, now silent. 
INT. CHIMERA - PASSAGEWAY - LATER - DAY 
Epps shines her light in the darkness as she comes to a door where daylight falls from a small port. She looks through it. 
INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps stands in a white tiled room. Light falls from port holes high in the wall. Running its length is a small swimming pool, it's rusted fixtures and stained surface creating bizarre patterns. 
INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps comes to a row of changing stalls. Old clothing hangs there, unused for fifty years. A pair of woman's shoes lie on the floor. 
INT. CHIMERA - SWIMMING POOL - LATER - DAY 
Epps moves along, passing through a doorway into 
INT. CHIMERA - GYMNASIUM - CONTINUOUS - DAY 
Epps enters another room scattered with old exercise equipment circa 1950, a wooden rowing machine, barbells and a medicine ball. 
She steps up to the wall, where pictures hang. The Chimera can be seen in better days, sailing full speed on a calm sea. 
INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - LATER - DAY 
Epps jumps down to a lower deck. She shines her light up to see that she is in an engine compartment, showing a massive diesel burner. She passes through into another compartment where the giant pistons of the ship's power plant rise up to the ceiling. 
INT. CHIMERA - SUB-DECK - PASSAGE - MOMENTS LATER - DAY 
Epps moves, passing still more diesel burners, towering over her in the cavernous space. She moves into a narrowing passage, piping and machinery ducts winding their way into the depths of the ship. 
Finally the passage opens into yet another compartment, apparently a cargo hold. Crates and boxes are stacked on loading palettes. 
In the corner, a rotting canvas drape covers something. Epps comes to it. She lifts the canvas, which crumbles away to reveal a 1951 Ferrari sportster. For the exception of a coat of dust and a small amount of corrosion, it is perfectly preserved. 
Mail bags lie in piles along the wall, stacked between more wooden crates and palettes, when something catches Epps' eye. 
A heavy, metal door in the wall is twisted on it's hinges, as though blown back from some terrific explosive force. 
Epps approaches, coming to the twisted door. She shines her light inside. 
A clutter of debris, shelving and wood, are visible in the shadows, when her light catches a glint of something. She swings her light back, revealing a yellowish bright object between broken wood slats. 
Epps steps in. She kneels, shining the light closer. The yellow glint is metal. Epps pulls back a slat, sliding away some of the debris to reveal that it is cast from a kilogram ingot of gold. 
She reaches out. She raises it, completely untouched by the years. She pulls back still more debris, revealing a stack of gold ingots, some having tumbled to the side. She slides away a large trunk that has fallen, pushing off more junk to see that the stack is much larger, perhaps four feet high and five feet across. 
A beat as Epps stands there, looking on at $50,000,000 in gold. 
INT. CHIMERA - CARGO COMPARTMENT - DAY 
The debris has been cleared away to reveal a clean 5'x 5' x 4' stack of gold ingots. 
DODGE (O.S.) What the fuck we gonna do with it? 
Greer, Murphy, Epps, and Dodge all look on. 
GREER What the fuck you think we gonna do with it? It's ours, baby. It's all ours. 
Murphy has stepped forward, taking an ingot, inspecting it. 
GREER How much you figure that's worth, skipper? 
MURPHY (still looking it over) Hard to say. Maybe forty, fifty million. 
GREER Ho, baby! 
EPPS That's a lot of money for somebody to just let float away. 
Murphy looks up at her from the gold. 
MURPHY Yes, it is. 
A beat as they all hold there. 
MURPHY It's a hell of a lot of money. 
DODGE What, you think there's something funny about it? 
MURPHY A ship with fifty million dollars in gold aboard, adrift? And nobody seems to care enough to come looking for it? 
GREER If they thought it was lost at sea, they probably just wrote it off. 
MURPHY Not for fifty million. An ocean liner maybe. But fifty million in gold, they come looking for.

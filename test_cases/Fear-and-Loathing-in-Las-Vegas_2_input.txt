Her face is CHANGING -- SWELLING -- PULSING... 
DUKE (shouts) NO!  WHY?  WE HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING YET! 
The FACE OF THE RESERVATIONS CLERK TURNS GREEN & GROWS FANGS. DEADLY POISON!  DUKE LUNGES BACK at GONZO, who GRIPS his arm intensely -- REACHES OUT to take the ENVELOPE. 
GONZO I can handle this.  This man has a bad heart, but I have plenty of medicine.  My name is Dr. Gonzo. Prepare our suite at once.  We'll be in the bar. 
GONZO manoeuvres DUKE away from the desk.  DUKE looks back -- the RESERVATIONS CLERKS is now a MORAY EEL -- green jowls and fangs. 
INT. NAUTICAL BAR - DAY 
The bar -- OILY PEOPLE -- quiet music -- nautical theme. DUKE and GONZO at the bar, a marlin spike hanging on the wall behind them.  DUKE has turned to stone... 
GONZO (to the bartender) Two Cuba Libres with beer and mescal on the side. (opens the envelope) Who's Lacerda, he's waiting for us in a room on the twelfth floor? 
DUKE Lacerda? 
DUKE (V/O) I couldn't remember.  The name rang a bell, but I couldn't concentrate. Terrible things were happening all around us... 
DUKE is staring -- RAPT -- TERRIFIED.  BLOOD FLOWS FREELY onto the floor.  DUKE keeps his voice low. 
DUKE Order some golf shoes.  Otherwise, we'll never get out of this place alive.  It's impossible to walk in this muck -- no footing at all... 
DUKE looks up -- GONZO has disappeared. 
DUKE looks around him -- the entire room has TRANSFORMED into a ROOM FILLED WITH REPTILES IN CLOTHES, DRINKING AND GNAWING AT ONE ANOTHER. 
DUKE (V/O) I was right in the middle of a fucking reptile zoo.  And somebody was giving booze to these goddamn things!  It won't be long before they tear us to shreds! 
GONZO IS SUDDENLY BACK -- AT DUKE'S SHOULDER. 
GONZO If you think we're in trouble now wait until you see what's happening in the elevators. 
GONZO removes his sunshades and we see he's been crying... as he speaks he seems to be floating.  Duke struggles to keep him in his line of vision. 
GONZO I just went upstairs to see this man Lacerda.  I told him I knew what he was up to... (GONZO rallies -- turns fierce) He says he's a photographer!  But when I mentioned Savage Henry he freaked!  He knows we're onto him! 
DUKE But what about our room?  And the golf shoes? 
A GROUP OF REPTILES AT A TABLE ACROSS THE ROOM stares at them, BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THEIR FANGS. 
DUKE (CONT'D) (grabbing GONZO trying to hold him still) Holy shit!  Look at that bunch over there!  They've spotted us! 
Cut to wider shot -- DUKE is holding on to a man standing next to him at the bar.  The room has returned to normality. GONZO is sitting in his original position. 
GONZO (downs his drink -- gets up) That's the press table.  Where you have to sign in for our credentials. Shit, let's get it over with.  You handle that, and I'll check on the room. 
DUKE No, no.  Don't leave me! 
Black screen. 
INT. MINT HOTEL SUITE - DUSK 
A TELEVISION shows the NIGHTLY NEWS.  A BUDDHIST MONK, protesting the war, sets himself on fire.  A very nervous BELL BOY is laying out GONZO's order.  A marlin spike is on the floor next to DUKE. 
BELL BOY Four club sandwiches, four shrimp cocktails. 
DUKE There's a big... machine in the sky... some kind of electric snake... 
DUKE is curled by the window -- MESMERIZED by an unseen neon sign outside the window.  His eyes fill with a million colored lights. 
BELL BOY ... a quart of rum... 
DUKE ... coming straight at us. 
GONZO Shoot it. 
DUKE Not yet.  I want to study its habits. 
BELL BOY ... and nine fresh grapefruit.

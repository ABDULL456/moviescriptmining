James shakes his head. 
AUNT HONEY (CONT'D) When your great Aunt pulled you into this world you were dead. You had gone cold. She slapped your ass hard too but you never drew a breath. Your momma and daddy had to say goodbye to you. But then your Great Aunt breathed in you one last time. And then you turned warm and then you screamed. So loud we heard it all the way here in Augusta. You're special, boy. Cause you got the spirit in you. And that spirit told me you gone be a rich man, Little Junior. And Everybody gone know your name. Ain't nothin' can touch you. You hear me? Nothin'. 
James nods. 92A                                                                92A INT. TOUR BUS. DAY. 1964 
The band on the bus. Bobby Bennet frowns and turns to Bobby Byrd. A new girl, YVONNE FAIR, gets on. 
DOWN THE BUS -- The others watch. 
MACEO Who's this? 
BOBBY BENNET (quietly) James gone wear that seat out. 
MACEO Which seat. Her's or the bus? 
Having overheard, Yvonne spends around. 
YVONNE I'm Yvonne! I'm a singer. Let me worry about my seat. 
Bennet and Maceo snicker. 
EXT. STREET/FISH HOUSE. DAY. 1965 
James and Ben Bart walk up a street. They turn a corner to see a gleaming new Cadillac parked next to the Fish House. 
We see a DRIVER inside. The driver exits. 
BART Compliments of Universal Attractions. 
JAMES This for me? Looky this! We got us a chauffeur. 
JAMES (CONT'D) (to the chauffeur) Gimme the keys. What they payin' you? 
James takes the keys and then pulls out a roll of bills and counts out six hundreds. He hands them to chauffeur. 
JAMES (CONT'D) This here's a month's pay, help you get yourself another job. I gone drive myself. 
The chauffeur smiles, hands Bart his hat and walks off down the street. 
JAMES (CONT'D) Don't mention it. (turns to Ben Bart) That's six a month goin' somewhere else. 
EXT. FISH HOUSE - DAY 
James and Pop sit at a small dining table outside the Fish House. 
JAMES Pop, see there's something I been meaning to ask you. 
BART What's that Jimmy. 
JAMES I got a seventh grade education Pop, so you'll have to excuse me. I was looking over those figures you sent me, and something occur to me: we don't pay the promoter, the promoter pay us. 
BART Just standard Jimmy. Guarantee against fluctuating ticket sales. Lets plan a- 
JAMES -sure we planning, see I ask myself, what if we don't got fluctuating sales. What if you knocking the tar out of every show. 
Ben Bart watches James with a new outlook on his partner and friend. 
BART Well let me explain the way it works. When you book a show. Take Chicago. Now our promoter in Chicago is- 
BART (CONT'D) Lenny J Frank. Lenny's the number one promoter in Chicago has been for twenty years. 
JAMES I don't doubt it. 
BART Now when Lenny pays us a flat rate, we can account. You know, number one, you're getting top rate and number two- 
JAMES What if we took the gate? (Bart stops JAMES looks over) What if we took it ourself. (MORE) 
JAMES (CONT'D) And still got the show promoted, but better. 
BEN BART Better than Lenny Franks? 
JAMES Lenny Franks a James Brown fan? How old he, sixty? Why's he gone try harder for James Brown than for Sam Cooke? Or Ray Charles. Or Tom Jones. See Pop. We go to the radio stations. 
BART Jimmy, I understand your frustration but you gotta realize you're entering a game where the rules are set out. If you were a ball player you can't walk in and change how many innings they're gonna play just because... 
As Bart drones on, James loses interest and starts addressing us directly. 
JAMES You see my point right? OK. Listen up. We go to the radio station. We go to the young cats. The hungry cats. The late night cat. 
INT. RADIO STATION. 
James talks to us as he stands next to a DEEJAY, ALAN LEEDS, The deejay doesn't hear James talking to us. 
JAMES The twenty year old white deejay in Richmond Virginia who's getting paid nothing and is only doin' it because he loves music. We go to him we ask him if he want to be the sole James Brown promoter for the Richmond show. For a percentage. He gone say: 
The deejay suddenly looks up to James. 
YOUNG RICHMOND DEEJAY Are you fucking kidding me? Do you know how much they pay me? 
JAMES WALKS PAST THROUGH THE STATION TALKING TO US. 
JAMES Between nothing and fifty bucks a week. But he love my music. He digs James Brown. And he got a microphone and a turn-table and four hours airtime to kill. 
YOUNG RICHMOND DEEJAY Screw Payola. 
LATER - THE RADIO STATION.

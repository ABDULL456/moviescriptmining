KYLE Hey, I'm the victim here. I'm allowed to do as I please. This was an honor. 
LYNN What? Monix stands up, wrapping a sheet around him. 
MONIX I'm outta here. 
KYLE Oh, c'mon man. Don't be like that. It's all cool. 
MONIX Believe me, this is not all cool.' Monix grabs his shit and walks out of the bedroom. 
MONIX I'll call you. 
KYLE Okay. 
LYNN Not you, asshole. He was talking to me. 
EXT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - NEXT NIGHT 
There's a real buzz in the air. People are pouring into the stadium tonight. Clarence is right outside the locker room, eating a Bit-o-Honey, watching with amazement. 
OFFICER MILLER Hey is that Coffee Black? I'm officer Miller, State Correctional, I'm a big fan, you can call me Jimmy. 
CLARENCE Nice to meet you. 
OFFICER MILLER Jackie Moon ordered up a bus full of prisoners. Any idea where we all should sit? 
INT. FLINT FAIRGROUNDS COLISEUM - CONTINUOUS 
PAN: The PRISONERS are all packed into the stands. Next to them is a huge group of ladies from an OLD FOLKS HOME... Next to a bus load of SICK KIDS from the hospital. 
ON PEEKSKILL trying to count. There's no use analyzing it, the place is sold out and the fans are going nuts. CENTER COURT: In a wrestling ring, Jackie is in a wrestling singlet, wearing head gear, drinking from a squirt bottle. PAN TO DEWIE THE BEAR, ready to go. CLARENCE, DRESSED AS A REF, is standing in front of JACKIE, messaging his shoulders. 
CLARENCE THE REF We sold out, man. You did good. 
JACKIE MOON I'm scared of bears, Clarence. 
CLARENCE THE REF What? 
JACKIE MOON I hate these things. I'm freaking out right now. 
CLARENCE THE REF If you're scared of bears, why the Hell are you wrestling one then? 
JACKIE MOON Look at this place. We're packed. It was a good idea. 
CLARENCE THE REF Well, don't worry, you'll pin him easy. It'll be fine. 
JACKIE MOON You don't understand. I don't like bears. I'm feeling dizzy. Jackie is seriously petrified. Clarence adjusts the collar of his ref jersey and looks around, worried about his friend. 
CLARENCE THE REF Maybe we should call it off. 
JACKIE MOON NO. Look into my eyes. (Clarence does) You're the ref tonight. No matter what happens in there, do not stop the fight, okay? 
These people came to see a show. I've got to make it through at least one round. 
CLARENCE THE REF Okay, until you finish the first round, I won't call it. Hey, how bad can three minutes be, right? 
BEAR HANDLER (O.S.) Are you guys ready? The bear handler is a large frizzy haired woman. 
CLARENCE THE REF I don't know, are we ready? 
JACKIE MOON Yeah, let's do it. 
BEAR HANDLER You guys want to give me a safe word? 
CLARENCE THE REF What's a safe word? 
BEAR HANDLER It's a word for you to yell to the Ref, so he can stop the match. 
JACKIE MOON I don't need a safe word. 
BEAR HANDLER Tell you what, if you get injured or you really feel like you're in danger, yell, um, I don't know... Spumoni. Once I get a signal from the ref, I'll come in. 
CLARENCE THE REF What's Spumoni? 
JACKIE MOON It's an Italian Gelato, sort of like Almond flavored ice cream. 
CLARENCE THE REF Is it good?

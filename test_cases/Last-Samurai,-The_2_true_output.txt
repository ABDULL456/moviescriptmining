KATSUMOTO But now you live again. 
ALGREN Yes. 
KATSUMOTO It was not your time. 
ALGREN No. Maybe I survived just to live this one last day. 
Algren looks at him. 
ALGREN I'll stay. 
He slowl y pulls himself up. He and Katsumoto gaze at the plain before them. 
At the infantry troops massing on the opposing hilltop. 
Algren looks at Katsumoto. He reaches into the pocket of his old uniform and takes out the Medal of Honor he received, long ago, at Sutter's Hill. 
He affixes it to his old cavalry tunic. 
Katsumoto looks at Algren. They are both thinking the same thing. 
Silent agreement. 
EXT.                    PLAIN                                  SUNSET 
The hundred mounted samurai are a beautiful sight. 
They wait in formation in front of the barricade, the long plain through the funnel to the opposing hilltop before them. 
Katsumoto draws his long samurai sword. 
Algren draws his. 
And they slowl y begin to trot forward... 
And then to canter... 
BEHIND THE IMPERIAL ARMY 
Colonel Bagley and Omura watch, transfixed. There is something approaching admiration on Omura's face. On Bagley's, there is only malice. 
BAGLEY The gatling guns. Quickly. 
EXT.                     PLAIN                             SUNSET 
Katsumoto points his sword and screams out his war cry. . 
And they charge. It is suicidal 
It is glorious. 
It is the end of the samurai. 
They charge forward, their war cries echoing in the canyon. 
The Imperial troops fire rifles -- samurai fall .. but still they come: -- pounding over the earth like something from an ancient dream 
Algren and Katsumoto charge side by side. Alive. Warriors. 
BEHIND THE IMPERIAL ARMY 
Bagley and Omura watch as the samurai fall, one by one. 
WITH THE CHARGE 
Fifteen or twenty of the samurai -- including Algren and Katsumoto-- somehow manage to fight their way through the lines. 
They break into the open. 
And continue riding straight toward the rear. 
ALGREN AND KATSUMOTO 
Are both wounded, yet still they charge. They have only one thought in mind -- death to their enemies. They gallop forward toward Bagley and Omura. 
BAGLEY 
Looks around in abject terror. He screams out an order. 
TWO WAGONS 
Are moving into position. Their rear gates fall open ... revealing the GATILING GUNS. 
ALGREN AND KATSUMOTO 
Are near enough to see them. Yet they will not be deterred. 
They charge on. 
Up ahead. 
THE GATLING GUNS 
Are not yet ready to fire. Japanese soldiers slam ammo belts into the chambers. 
ALGREN, KATSUMOTO AND THE REMAINING SAMURAI 
Have almost reached their goal. 
BAGLEY 
Cowers in fear, looks around, but there is nowhere to hide.

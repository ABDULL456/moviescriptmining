HOLDEN With a member of the opposite sex. 
ALYSSA Why?  Why only then? 
HOLDEN Because that's the standard. 
ALYSSA So if a virgin is raped, then she's still a virgin? 
HOLDEN Of course not. 
ALYSSA But rape is not the standard.  So she's had sex, but not the standard idea of sex.  Hence, according to your definition, she'd still be a virgin. 
HOLDEN Okay, I'll revise.  Virginity is lost when the hymen is broken. 
ALYSSA Then I lost my virginity at ten, because I fell on a fence post when I was ten, and it broke my hymen.  Now I have to tell people that I lost it to a wooden post I'd known my whole young life? 
HOLDEN Second revision - virginity is lost through penetration. 
ALYSSA Physical penetration or emotional? 
HOLDEN Emotional? 
ALYSSA Well, I fell in love hard with Caitlin Bree when we were in high school. 
HOLDEN Physical penetration. 
ALYSSA We had sex. 
HOLDEN Yeah, but not real sex. 
ALYSSA I move to have that remark stricken from the record.  On account of it makes you come off as completely naive and infantile. 
HOLDEN Well where's the penetration in lesbian sex. 
Alyssa holds up her hand. 
HOLDEN A finger?  Come on.  I've had my finger in my ass but I wouldn't say I've had anal sex. 
ALYSSA Did I hold up a finger? (waves her hand) 
HOLDEN (beat; then he gets it) You're kidding?!?! (she nods) How...?!? 
ALYSSA Our bodies are built to pass a child, for Christ's sake. 
HOLDEN But doesn't it hurt?! 
ALYSSA Sure.  But in a good way.  And it's only a once-in-awhile thing - reserved for really special occasions. 
HOLDEN What about not-so-special occasions? 
ALYSSA Tongue only. 
HOLDEN But how can that be enough?  I mean, let's be real - how big can a tongue even get? 
Alyssa swallows what she's chewing and releases her tongue, which is just huge.  Holden is transfixed. Alyssa wraps it back up and smiles, standing. 
ALYSSA Let's go. 
She exits. Holden remains in the swing.  Alyssa comes back in.

Mr. Gibbons, applauding with everyone else, chooses that very moment to sit on the bumper. 
DEPLOYING THE AIRBAG! 
SLAMMING Kat's head backwards through the spike, HEAD-KABOB. 
Kat's dead limp hand drops her last cigarette -- which bounces along the hard dirt -- toward the oncoming gas. Closer, closer,.. The BREEZE KICKS UP, aiding the cigarette. 
WHOOSH, the gas fuse catches. The blusih flame travels through pipes, over rocks, racing toward the news VAN. 
Kimberly , half-traumatized, watches an ominous BREEZE rustle through the field, up to the trees, toward Thomas. 
The GAS BURNS up an incline, and disappears into the ground... And pops up twenty feet closer to the News Van. 
Kimberly follows the BREEZE to the dead oak tree under which Thomas stands. And blows a large branch until it snaps! A startled Thomas sees it fall just in time to DIVE to safety. 
Clear, seeing the flame, instinctively runs from the van. 
CLEAR Get back! 
BOOM! The news van's explosion hurls two fence posts just over Thomas' head, end over end, the two lengths of wire stretched between them. The flying garrote heads directly for -- 
Rory, who sorts hard, stands up with a satisfied smile - and is sliced into three sharp cuts of beef. 
The silence from the emergency crew is deafening. Mr. Gibbons starts crying hysterically. 
MR. GIBBONS I didn't mean to do it - I didn't know. 
Kimberly numbly stares at the fallen branch, the one that caused Thomas to step out of the path of the flying fence. 
KIMBERLY (to herself) It wasn't his turn.   And it's not my turn. 
Kimberly sees the corpses of Kat and Rory, buries the pain, and approaches Mr. Gibbons. 
KIMBERLY Give me the keys to your truck. Now! 
MR. GIBBONS (hysterical) Anything you want. Anything.      I wish I knew. I didn't... 
Mr. Gibbons hands Kimberly the keys. 
EXT. WESTCHESTER COUNTY - MOMENTS LATER 
Kimberly drives Thomas and Clear in the Gibbons' truck. All are numb. 
THOMAS (buckling up) Hurry up. There's no time.   She's about to give birth. 
Kimberly unbuckles her seatbelt and floors it. 
CLEAR 
What are you doing?     You're going to kill us! 
KIMBERLY No. If anyone dies from a crash now, it'll be me. But I can't die if Eugene and Isabella are still alive. I'm last on Death's list. 
CLEAR Are you crazy? What makes you think you'd survive? 
KIMBERLY What happened when Eugene tried to kill himself out of turn? 
CLEAR (considering) Six duds in a row. 
KIMBERLY And when it was Rory's turn to die, and Thomas was in the way? 
THOMAS That branch fell and saved my life. You're right, Death's maintaining the order. 
KIMBERLY Let's pray that Isabella's still alive. 
The truck speeds into the horizon. 
EXT. PHELP'S MEMORIAL HOSPITAL - ESTABLISHING SHOT 
INT. DELIVERY ROOM - DAY 
Typical chatter as the staff preps Isabella. Steve paces nervously in the background. 
STAFF ...contractions coming quicker now. Take her pressure and CTG. One centimeter dilation. Prep the epidural stat. 
Isabella breathes Lamaze style in the hospital bed, her feet in stirrups. A NURSE rocks Isabella's body back and forth, until her back arches almost unnaturally forward. 
In the BG, an OBSTETRICIAN, 50s, sterilizes his hands in a scrub sink. 
A female ANESTHESIOLOGIST hustles over, swabbing a LONG EPIDURAL NEEDLE. The nurse places a mask over Isabella's face. The Anesthesiologist lowers the needle to the base of Isabella's spine. 
ANESTHESIOLOGIST She's going to have to stop moving if I'm going to --

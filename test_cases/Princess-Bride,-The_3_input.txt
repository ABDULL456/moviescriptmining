CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
in her bridal gown, and she's incredible. It's not just her beauty; there's a tranquillity about her now. 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
The Prince, fastening a pearl necklace around her. 
HUMPERDINCK You don't seem excited, my little muffin. 
BUTTERCUP Should I be? 
HUMPERDINCK Brides often are, I'm told. 
BUTTERCUP (gently, confidently) I do not marry tonight. 
CUT TO: 
BUTTERCUP 
and she couldn't seem more serene. 
BUTTERCUP My Westley will save me. 
CUT TO: 
HER WESTLEY 
looking down on the gate with Inigo and Fezzik. 
CUT TO: 
THE MAIN GATE OF THE CASTLE 
-- and Yellin, standing there, flanked by his sixty Brutes. 
CUT TO: 
WESTLEY AND INIGO AND FEZZIK 
looking out at the enemy. This is it. Inigo and FEZZIK shake hands. 
Westley can't even do that, but after a bit of rocking back and forth, he manages to get enough momentum to catapult his arm over and onto his friend's. 
CUT TO: 
AN ABSOLUTELY GEM-LIKE LITTLE CHAPEL 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL 
The most intelligent looking, the most impressive appearing CLERGYMAN imaginable. 
Buttercup and Humperdinck kneel before the Clergyman. Behind them sit the mumbling old KING AND QUEEN. Standing in the back is Count Rugen. 
FOUR GUARDS are in position flanking the chapel door. 
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN (clears his throat, begins to speak) Mawidge...mawidge is what bwings us togewer today... 
He has an impediment that would stop a clock. 
IMPRESSIVE CLERGYMAN Mawidge, the bwessed awwangement, that dweam wiffim a dweam... 
And now, from outside the castle, there begins to come a commotion. And then-- 
YELLIN (off-screen) Stand your ground, men. Stand your ground. 
CUT TO: 
THE BRUTES AND YELLIN 
by the gate, for it is indeed they who are making the commotion, frightened, pointing. 
YELLIN Stand your ground. 
CUT TO: 
THEIR P.O.V.: 
And it is a bit unnerving -- a GIANT seems to be floating toward them out of the darkness, a Giant in a strange cloak, and with a voice that would crumble walls. 
FEZZIK (deep and booming) I AM THE DREAD PIRATE ROBERTS. THERE WILL BE NO SURVIVORS. 
CUT TO: 
FEZZIK 
and he seems to be floating because he's standing in the wheelbarrow, as Inigo, hidden behind him, busts a gut by pushing it and supporting Westley. 
INIGO Now? 
WESTLEY Not yet. 
CUT TO: 
THE GIANT FLOATING CLOSER

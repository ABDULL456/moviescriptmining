You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic? \n(he guffaws) \nThat's great! \nLOVETT \n(warningly) \nLewis... \nBut Rose laughs with Bodine. \nBODINE \n(still laughing) \nAll you had to do was wait two days! \nLovett, standing out of Rose's sightline, checks his watch. Hours have passed. This process is taking too long. \nLOVETT \nRose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that? \nROSE \nIm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett. \nLizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out. \nLOVETT \nWait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination? \nLIZZY \nThat's enough. \nLizzy takes her out.

Lovett walks as he talks with Bobby Buell, the partners' rep. They weave among deck cranes, launch crew, sub maintenance guys. \nBUELL \nThe partners are pissed. \nBROCK \nBobby, buy me time. I need time. \nBUELL \nWe're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over. I'm telling you what they're telling me. The hand is on the plug. It's starting to pull. \nBROCK \nWell you tell the hand I need another two days! Bobby, Bobby, Bobby... we're close! I smell it. I smell ice. She had the diamond on... now we just have to find out where it wound up. I just gotta work her a bit more. Okay? \nBrock turns and sees Lizy standing behind him. She has overheard the past part of his dialogue with Buell. He goes to her and hustles her away from Buell, toward a quite spot on the deck. \nBROCK \nHey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second. \nLIZZY \nDon't you mean work me? \nBROCK \nLook, I'm running out of time. I need your help. \nLIZZY \nI'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and \n(MORE) \nLIZZY (CONT'D) \none year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off. \nBROCK \n(with undisguised desperation) \nLizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory. \n(he holds out his hand) \nYou see this? Right here? \nShe looks at his hand, palm up. Empty. Cupped, as if around an imaginary shape. \nLIZZY \nWhat? \nBROCK \nThat's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it. \nLIZZY \nLook, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are. \nLOVETT \nMaybe she wants to make peace with the past. \nLIZZY \nWhat past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago. \nLOVETT \nThen we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time. \nLIZZY \n(looks at him hard) \nYou think she was really there? \nLOVETT \nOh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there. \nCUT TO: \n70 INT. IMAGING SHACK \nBodine starts the tape recorder. Rose is gazing at the screen seeing THE LIVE FEED FROM THE WRECK--SNOOP DOG is moving along the starboard side of the hull, heading aft.

B DECK TITANIC - DAY \nMATCH DISSOLVE from the rusting hulk to the gleaming new Titanic in 1912, passing the end of the enclosed promenade just as Rose walks into the sunlight right in front of us. She is stunningly dressed and walking with purpose. \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nAs if I hadn't felt the sun in years. \nIT IS SATURDAY APRIL 13, 1912. Rose unlatches the gate to go down into third class. The steerage men on the deck stop what they're doing and stare at her. \nCUT TO: \n72 INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM \nThe social center of steerage life. It is stark by comparison to the opulence of first class, but is a loud, boisterous place. There are mothers with babies, kids running between the benches yelling in several languages and being scolded in several more. There are old women yelling, men playing chess, girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels. There is even an upright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around it. \nThree boys, shrieking and shouting, are scrambling around chasing a rat under the benches, trying to whomp it with a shoe and causing general havoc. Jack is playing with 5 year old CORA CARTMeLL, drawing funny faces together in his sketchbook. \nFabrizio is struggling to get a conversation going with an attractive Norwegian girl, HELGA DAHL, sitting with her family at a table across the room. \nFABRIZIO \nNo Italian? Some little English? \nHELGA \nNo, no. Norwegian. Only. \nHelga's eye is caught by something. Fabrizio looks, does a take... and Jack, curious, follows their gaze to see... \nRose, coming toward them. The activity in the room stops... a hush falls. Rose feels suddenly self-conscious as the steerage passengers stare openly at this princess, some with resentment, others with awe. She spots Jack and gives a little smile, walking straight to him. He rises to meet her, smiling. \nROSE \n", "test1_true": "Fabrizio and Tommy are floored. Its like the slipper fitting Cinderella. \nJACK \nHello again. \nROSE \nCould I speak to you in private? \nJACK \nUh, yes. Of course. After you. \nHe motions her ahead and follows. Jack glances over his shoulder, one eyebrow raised, as he walks out with her leaving a stunned silence. \nCUT TO: \n73 EXT. BOAT DECK - DAY \nJack and Rose walk side by side. They pass people reading and talking in steamer chairs, some of whom glance curiously at the mismatched couple. He feels out of place in his rough clothes. They are both awkward, for different reasons. \nJACK \nSo, you got a name by the way? \nROSE \nRose. Rose DeWitt Bukater. \nJACK \nThat's quite a moniker. I may hafta get you to write that down. \nThere is an awkward pause. \nROSE \nMr. Dawson, I-- \nJACK \nJack. \nROSE \nJack... I feel like such an idiot. It took me all morning to get up the nerve to face you. \nJACK \nWell, here you are. \nROSE \nHere I am. I... I want to thank you for what you did. Not just for... for pulling me back. But for your discretion. \nJACK \nYou're welcome. Rose. \nROSE \nLook, I know what you must be thinking! Poor little rich girl. What does she know about misery? \nJACK \nThat's not what I was thinking. What I was thinking was... what could have happened to hurt this girl so much she though she had no way out. \nROSE \nI don't... it wasn't just one thing. It was everything. It was them, it was their whole world. And I was trapped in it, like an insect in amber. \n(in a rush) \nI just had to get away... just run and run and run... and then I was at the back rail and there was no more ship... even the Titanic wasn't big enough. Not enough to get away from them. And before I'd really though about it, I was over the rail. I was so furious. I'll show them. They'll be sorry! \nJACK \nUh huh. They'll be sorry. 'Course you'll be dead. \nROSE \n(she lowers her head) \nOh God, I am such an utter fool. \nJACK \nThat penguin last night, is he one of them? \nROSE \nPenguin? Oh, Cal! He is them. \nJACK \nIs he your boyfriend? \nROSE \nWorse I'm afraid. \nShe shows him her engagement ring. A sizable diamond. \nJACK \nGawd look at that thing! You would have gone straight to the bottom. \nThey laugh together. A passing steward scowls at Jack, who is clearly not a first class passenger, but Rose just glares at him away. \nJACK \nSo you feel like you're stuck on a train you can't get off 'cause you're marryin' this fella. \nROSE \nYes, exactly! \nJACK \nSo don't marry him. \nROSE \nIf only it were that simple. \nJACK \nIt is that simple. \nROSE \nOh, Jack... please don't judge me until you've seen my world. \nJACK \nWell, I guess I will tonight. \nLooking for another topic, any other topic, she indicates his sketchbook. \nROSE \nWhat's this? \nJACK \nJust some sketches. \nROSE \nMay I? \nThe question is rhetorical because she has already grabbed the book. She sits on a deck chair and opens the sketchbook. ON JACK'S sketches... each one an expressive little bit of humanity: an old woman's hands, a sleeping man, a father and daughter at the rail. The faces are luminous and alive. His book is a celebration of the human condition. \nROSE \nJack, these are quite good! Really, they are. \nJACK \nWell, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. \nSome loose sketches fall out and are taken by the wind. Jack scrambles after them... catching two, but the rest are gone, over the rail. \nROSE \nOh no! Oh, I'm so sorry. Truly! \nJACK \nWell, they didn't think too much of 'em in Paree. \nHe snaps his wrist, shaking his drawing hand in a flourish. \nJACK \nI just seem to spew 'em out. Besides, they're not worth a damn anyway. \nFor emphasis he throws away the two he caught.

Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here. \n(he gestures along the eck) \nBut it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled. \nCAL \n(slapping the side of a boat) \nWaste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable ship! \nANDREWS \nSleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship, strong and true. She's all the lifeboat you need. \nAs they are passing Boat 7, a gentlemen turns from the rail and walks up behind the group. It is Jack. He taps Rose on the arm and she turns, gasping. He motions and she cuts away from the group toward a door which Jack holds open. They duck into the-- \nCUT TO: \n97 INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY \nJack closes the door behind her, and glances out through the ripple-glass window to the starboard rail, where the gym instructor is chatting up the woman who was riding the bike. Rose and Jack are alone in the room. \nROSE \nJack, this is impossible. I can't see you. \nHe takes her by the shoulders. \nJACK \nRose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and-- \nROSE \nJack, I-- \nJACK \nNo wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright. \nRose feels the tears coming to her eyes. Jack is so open and real... not like anyone she has ever known. \nROSE \nYou're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really. \nJACK \nI don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out. \nROSE \nIt's not up to you to save me, Jack. \nJACK \nYou're right. Only you can do that. \nROSE \nI have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone. \nCUT TO: \n98 INT. FIRST CLASS LOUNG - DAY \nThe most elegant room on the ship, done in Louis Quinze Versaille style. Rose sits on a divan, with a group of other women arrayed around her. Ruth, the Countess Rothes and Lady Duff-Gordon are taking tea. Rose is silent and still as a porcelain figurine as the conversation washes around her. \nRUTH \nOf course the invitations had to be sent back to the printers twice. And the bridesmaids dresses! Let me tell you what an odyssey that has been... \nTRACKING SLOWLY IN on Rose as Ruth goes on. \nREVERSE, ROSE'S POV: A tabeau of MOTHER and DAUGHTER having tea. The four year old girl, wearing white gloves, daintily picking up a cookie. The mother correcting her on her posture, and the way she holds the teacup. The little girl is trying so hard to please, her expression serious. A glimpse of Rose at that age, and we see the relentless conditioning... the pain to becoming an Edwardian geisha. \nON ROSE. She calmly and deliberately turns her teacup over, spilling tea all over her dress. \nROSE \nOh, look what I've done. \nCUT TO: \n99 EXT. TITANIC - DAY \nTITANIC STEAMS TOWARD US, in the dusk light, as if lit by the embers of a giant fire. As the ship looms, FILLING FRAME, we push in on the bow. Jack is there, right at the apex of the bow railing, his favorite spot. He closes his eyes, letting the chill wind clear his head. \nJack hears her voice, behind him... \nROSE \nHello, Jack. \nHe turns and she is standing there. \nROSE \nI changed my mind. \nHe smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in. Her cheeks are red with the chill wind, and her eyes sparkle. Her hair blows wildly about her face. \nROSE \nFabrizio said you might be up-- \nJACK \nSssshh. Come here. \nHe puts his hands on her waist. As if he is going to kiss her. \nJACK \nClose your eyes. \nShe does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going. He presses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her. Then he takes her two hands and raises them until she is standing with her arms outstetched on each side. Rose is going along with him. When he lowers his hands, her arms stay up... like wings. \nJACK \nOkay. Open them. \nRose gasps. There is nothing in her field of vision but water. It's like there is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring. The Atlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky. There is only the wind, and the hiss of the water 50 feel below. \nROSE \nI'm flying! \nShe leans forward, arching her back. He puts his hands on her waist to steady her. \nJACK \n(singing softly) \nCome Josephine in my flying machine... \nRose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above the sea. She smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back against his chest. He pushes forward slightly against her. \nSlowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers... fingertips gently touching. Then their fingers intertwine. Moving slowly, their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of two lovers. \nJack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of her wash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear. \nRose turns her head until her lips are near his. She lowers her arms, turning further, until she finds his mouth with hers. He wraps his arms around her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned and tilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. They kiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion. \nJack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism, lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward into a night without fear. \n100 IN THE CROW'S NEST, high above and behind them, lookout FREDERICK FLEET nudges his mate, REGINALD LEE, pointing down at the figures in the bow. \nFLEET \nWish I had those bleedin' binoculars. \n101 JACK AND ROSE, embracing at the bow rail, DISSOLVE SLOWLY AWAY, leaving the ruined bow of the WRECK-- \nCUT TO: \n102 INT.

There's Smith, he's standing there with the iceberg warning in his fucking hand... \n(remembering Rose) \n... excuse me... in his hand, and he's ordering more speed. \nBROCK \n26 years of experience working against him. He figures anything big enough to sink the ship they're going to see in time to turn. But the ship's too big, with too small a rudder... it can't corner worth shit.

Like in a dream the beautiful woodwork and satin upholstery emerge from the rusted ruin. Jack is overwhelmed by the opulence of the room. He sets his sketchbood and drawing materials on the marble table. \nROSE \nWill this light do? Don't artists need good light? \nJACK \n(bad French accent) \nZat is true, I am not used to working in such 'orreeble conditions. \n(seeing the paintings) \nHey... Monet! \nHe crouches next to the paintings stacked against the wall. \nJACK \nIsn't he great... the use of color? I saw him once... through a hole in this garden fence in Giverny. \nShe goes into the adjoining walk-in wardrobe closet. He sees her go to the safe and start working the combination. He's fascinated. \nROSE \nCal insist on luggin this thing everywhere. \nJACK \nShould I be expecting him anytime soon? \nROSE \nNot as long as the cigars and brandy hold out. \nCLUNK! She unlocks the safe. Glancing up, she meets his eyes in the mirror behind the safe. She opens it and removes the necklace, then holds it out to Jack who takes it nervously. \nJACK \nWhat is it? A sapphire? \nROSE \nA diamond. A very rare diamond, called the Heart of the Ocean. \nJack gazes at wealth beyond his comprehension. \nROSE \nI want you to draw me like your French girl. Wearing this. \n(she smiles at him) \nWearing only this. \nHe looks up at her, surprised, and we CUT TO: \n104 ROSE'S BEDROOM. ON THE BUTTERFLY COMB as Rose draws it out of her hair. She shakes her head and her hair falls free around her shoulders. \n105 IN THE SITTING ROOM Jack is laying out his pencils like surgical tools. His sketchbook is open and ready. He looks up as she comes into the room, wearing a silk kimono. \nROSE \nThe last thing I need is another picture of me looking like a china doll. As a paying customer, I expect to get what I want. \nShe hands him a dime and steps back, parting the kimono. The blue stone lies on her creamy breast. Her heart is pounding as she slowly lowers the robe. \nJakc looks so stricken, it is almost comical. The kimono drops to the floor (this is all in cuts, lyrical). \nROSE \nTell me when it looks right to you. \nShe poses on the divan, settling like a cat into the position we remember from the drawing... almost. \nJACK \nUh... just bend your left leg a little and... and lower your head. Eyes to me. That's it. \nJack starts to sketch. He drops his pencil and she stifles a laugh. \nROSE \nI believe you are blushing, Mr. Big Artiste. I can't imagine Monsieur Monet blushing. \nJACK \n(sweating) \nHe does landscapes. \nTIGHT ON JACK as his eyes come up to look at her over the top edge of his sketchpad. We have seen this image of him before, in her memory. It is an image she will carry the rest of her life. \nDespite his nervousness, he draws with sure strokes, and what emerges is the best thing he has ever done. Her pose is languid, her hands beautiful, and her eyes radiate her energy. \nPUSH SLOWLY IN ON ROSE'S FACE... \nTRANSITION: \n106 INT. KELDYSH / IMAGING SHACK \nMATCH DISSOLVE/MORPH to Rose, 101 years old. Only her eyes are the same. \nOLD ROSE \nMy heart was pounding the whole time.

The story of Jack and Rose has finally and completely grabbed them. \nBODINE \nWhat, uh... happened next? \nOLD ROSE \n(smiling) \nYou mean, did we \"do it\"? \nCUT TO: \n107 INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE - NIGHT \nBACK TO 1912. Jack is signing the drawing. Rose, wearing her kimono again, is leaning on his shoulder, watching. \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nSorry to disappoint you Mr. Bodine. \nRose gazes at the drawing. He has X-rayed her soul. \nROSE \nDate it, Jack. I want to always remember this night. \nHe does: 4/14/1912. Rose meanwhile scribbles a note on a piece of Titanic stationary. We don't see what it says. She accepts the drawing from him, and crosses to the safe in the wardrobe. \nShe puts the diamond back in the safe, placing hte drawing and the note on top of it. Closes the door with a CLUNK! \nCUT TO: \n108 INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM - NIGHT \nLovejoy enters from the Palm Court through the revolving door and crosses the room toward Hockley. A fire is blazing in the marble fireplace, and the usual fatcats are playing cards, drinking and talking.

ATLANTIC - NIGHT \nTITANIC glides across an unnatural sea, blakc and calm as a pool of oil. The ships lights are mirrored almost perfectly in the black water. The sky is brilliant with stars. A meteor traces a bright line across the heavens. \n110 ON THE BRIDGE, Captain Smith peers out at the blackness ahead of the ship. QUARTERMASTER HITCHINS brings him a cup of hot tea with lemon. It steams in the bitter cold of the open bridge. Second Officer Lightoller is next to him, staring out at the sheet of black glass the Atlantic has become. \nLIGHTOLLER \nI don't think I've ever seen such a flat calm, in 24 years at sea. \n", "test2_id": 145, "test3_input": "(uncertain) \nHe couldn't have. \nCAL \nOf course he could.

There is a label inside the collar with the owner's name. \nMASTER AT ARMS \nThat was reported stolen today. \nJACK \nI was going to return it! Rose-- \nRose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. She shrinks away from him. He starts shouting to her as Lovejoy and the Master at Arms drag him out into the hall. She can't look him in the eye. \nJACK \nRose, don't listen to them... I didn't do this! You know I didn't! You know it! \nShe is devastated.

MAIL SORTING ROOM / HOLD \nSmith and Andrews come down the steps to the Mail Sorting Room and finds the clerks scrambling to pull mail from the racks. They are furiously hauling wet sacks of mail up from the hold below. \nAndrews climbs partway down the stairs to the hold, which is almost full. Sacks of mail float everywhere. The lights are still on below the surface, casting an eerie glow. The Renault is visible under the water, the brass glinting cheerfully. Andrews looks down as the water covers his shoe, and scrambles back up the stairs. \nCUT TO: \n163 INT. BRIDE / CHARTROOM \nAndrews unrolls a big drawing of the ship across the chartroom table. It is a side elevation, showing all the watertight bulkheads. His hands are shaking. Murdoch and Ismay hover behind Andrews and the Captain. \nISMAY \nWhen can we get underway, do you think? \nSmith glares at him and turns his attention to Andrews' drawing. The builder points to it for emphasis as he talks. \nANDREWS \nWater 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six. \nSMITH \nThat's right. \nANDREWS \nFive compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it. \nSMITH \nThe pumps-- \nANDREWS \nThe pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder. \nISMAY \nBut this ship can't sink! \nANDREWS \nShe is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will. It is a mathematical certainty. \nSmith looks like he has been gutpunched. \nSMITH \nHow much time? \nANDREWS \nAn hour, two at most. \nIsmay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare. \nSMITH \nAnd how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch? \nMURDOCH \nTwo thousand two hundred souls aboard, sir. \nA long beat. Smith turns to his employer. \nSMITH \nI believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Ismay. \nCUT TO: \n164 EXT. BOAT DECK \nAndrews is striding along the boat deck, as seamen and officers scurry to uncover the boats. Steam is venting from pipes on the funnes overhead, and the din is horrendous. Speech is difficult adding to the crew's level of disorganization. Andrews sees some men fumbling with the mechanism of one of the Wellin davits and yells to them over the roar of steam. \nANDREWS \nTurn to the right! Pull the falls taut before you unchock. Have you never had a boat drill? \nSEAMAN \nNo sir! Not with these new davits, sir. \nHe looks around, disguisted as the crew fumble with the davits, and the tackle for the \"falls\"... the ropes which are used to lower the boats. A few passengers are coming out on deck, hesitantly in the noise and bitter cold. \nCUT TO: \n165 INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE \nFrom inside the sitting room they can hear knocking and voices in the corridor. \nRUTH \nI had better go dress. \nRuth exits and Hockley crosses to Rose. He regards her coldly for a moment, then SLAPS her across the face. \nCAL \nIt is a little slut, isn't it? \nTo Rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has been given. Cal grabs her shoulders roughly. \nCAL \nLook at me, you little-- \nThere is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice. The door opens and their steward puts his head in. \nSTEWARD BARNES \nSir, I've been told to ask you to please put on your lifebelt, and come up to the boat deck. \nCAL \nGet out. We're busy. \nThe steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of a dresser. \nSTEWARD \nI'm sorry about the inconvenience, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders. Please dress warmly, it's quite cold tonight. \n(he hands a lifebelt to Rose) \n", "test3_true": "CAL \nThis is ridiculous. \nIn the corridor outside the stewards are being so polite and obsequious they are conveying no sense of danger whatsoever. However, it's another story in... \nCUT TO: \n166 INT. STEERAGE BERTHING AFT \nBLACKNESS. Then BANG! The door is thrown open and the lights snapped on by a steward. The Cartmell family rouses from a sound sleep. \nSTEWARD #2 \nEverybody up. Let's go. Put your lifebelts on. \nIN THE CORRIDOR outside, another steward is going from door to door along the hall, pouncing and yelling. \nSTEWARD #2 \nLifebelts on. Lifebelts on. Everybody up, come on. Lifebelts on... \nPeople come out of the doors behind the steward, perplexed. In the foreground a SYRIAN WOMAN asks her husband what was said. He shrugs. \nCUT TO: \n167 INT. WIRELESS ROOM \nON PHILLIPS, looking shocked. \nPHILLIPS \nCQD, sir? \nSMITH \nThat's right. The distress call. CQD. Tell whoever responds that we are going down by the head and need immediate assistance. \nSmith hurries out. \nPHILLIPS \nBlimey. \nBRIDE \nMaybe you ought to try that new distress call... S.O.S. \n(grinning) \nIt may be our only chance to use it. \nPhillips laughs in spite of himself and starts sending history's first S.O.S. Dit dit dit, da da da, dit dit dit... over and over. \nCUT TO: \n168 EXT. BOAT DECK \nThomas Andrews looks around in amazement. The deck is empty except for the crew fumbling with the davits. He yells over the roar of the steam to First Officer Murdoch. \nANDREWS \nWhere are all the passengers? \nMURDOCH \nThey've all gone back inside. Too damn cold and noisy for them. \nAndrews feels like he is in a bad dream. He looks at his pocketwatch and heads for the foyer entrance. \nCUT TO: \n169 INT. A-DECK FOYER \nA large number of First Class passengers have gathered near the staircase. They are getting indignant about the confusion. Molly Brown snags a passing YOUNG STEWARD. \nMOLLY \nWhat's doing, sonny? You've got us all trussed up and now we're cooling our heels. \nThe young steward backs away, actually stumbling on the stairs. \nYOUNG STEWARD \nSorry, mum. Let me go and find out. \nThe jumpy piano rhythm of \"Alexander's Ragtime Band\" comes out of the first class lounge a few yards away. Band leader WALLACE HARTLEY has assembled some of his men on Captain's orders, to allay panic. \nHockley's entourage comes up to the A-deck foyer. Cal is carrying the lifebelts, almost as an afterthought. Rose is like a sleepwalker. \nCAL \nIt's just the God damned English doing everything by the book. \nRUTH \nThere's no need for language, Mr. Hockley. \n(to Trudy) \nGo back and turn the heater on in my room, so it won't be too cold when we get back. \nThomas Andrews enters, looking around the magnificent room, which he knows is doomed. Rose, standing nearby, sees his heartbroken expression. She walks over to him and Cal goes after her. \nROSE \nI saw the iceberg, Mr. Andrews. And I see it in your eyes. Please tell me the truth. \nANDREWS \nThe ship will sink. \nROSE \nYou're certain? \nANDREWS \nYes. In an hour or so... all this... will be at the bottom of the Atlantic. \nCAL \nMy God. \nNow it is Cal's turn to look stunned. The Titanic? Sinking? \nANDREWS \nPlease tell only who you must, I don't want to be responsible for a panic. And get to a boat quickly. Don't wait. You remember what I told you about the boats? \nROSE \nYes, I understand. Thankyou. \nAndrews goes off, moving among the passengers and urging them to put on their lifebelts and get to the boats. \nCUT TO: \n170 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE \nLovejoy and the Master at Arms are handcuffing Jack to a 4\" WATER PIPE as a crewman rushes in anxiously and almost blurts to the Master at Arms-- \nCREWMAN \nYou're wanted by the Purser, sir. Urgently. \nLOVEJOY \nGo on. I'll keep an eye on him. \nLovejoy pulls a pearl handled Colt .45 automatic from under his coat. The Master at Arms nods and tosses the handcuff key to Lovejoy, then exits with the crewman. Lovejoy flips the key in the air. Catches it. \nCUT TO: \n171 INT. BRIDGE \nJunior Wireless Operator Bride is relaying a message to Captain Smith from the CUNARD LINER CARPATHIA. \nBRIDE \nCarpathia says they're making 17 knots, full steam for them, sir. \nSMITH \nAnd she's the only one who's responding? \nBRIDE \nThe only one close, sir. She says they can be here in four hours. \nSMITH \nFour hours! \nThe enormity of it hits Smith like a sledgehammer blow. \nSMITH \nThank you, Bride. \nHe turns as Bride exits, and looks out onto the blackness. \nSMITH \n(to himself) \n", "test3_id": 146}

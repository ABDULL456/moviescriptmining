{"train": "T I T A N I C \na screenplay by James Cameron \n1 BLACKNESS \nThen two faint lights appear, close together... growing brighter. They resolve into two DEEP SUBMERSIBLES, free-falling toward us like express elevators. \nOne is ahead of the other, and passes close enough to FILL FRAME, looking like a spacecraft blazing with lights, bristling with insectile manipulators. \nTILTING DOWN to follow it as it descends away into the limitless blackness below. Soon they are fireflies, then stars. Then gone. \nCUT TO: \n2 EXT./ INT. MIR ONE / NORTH ATLANTIC DEEP \nPUSHING IN on one of the falling submersibles, called MIR ONE, right up to its circular viewport to see the occupants. \nINSIDE, it is a cramped seven foot sphere, crammed with equipment. ANATOLY MIKAILAVICH, the sub's pilot, sits hunched over his controls... singing softly in Russian. \nNext to him on one side is BROCK LOVETT. He's in his late forties, deeply tanned, and likes to wear his Nomex suit unzipped to show the gold from famous shipwrecks covering his gray chest hair. He is a wiley, fast-talking treasure hunter, a salvage superstar who is part historian, part adventurer and part vacuum cleaner salesman. Right now, he is propped against the CO2 scrubber, fast asleep and snoring. \nOn the other side, crammed into the remaining space is a bearded wide-body named LEWIS BODINE, sho is also asleep. Lewis is an R.O.V. (REMOTELY OPERATED VEHICLE) pilot and is the resident Titanic expert. \nAnatoly glances at the bottom sonar and makes a ballast adjustment. \nCUT TO: \n3 EXT. THE BOTTOM OF THE SEA \nA pale, dead-flat lunar landscape. It gets brighter, lit from above, as MIR ONE enters FRAME and drops to the seafloor in a downblast from its thrusters. It hits bottom after its two hour free-fall with a loud BONK. \nCUT TO: \n4 INT. MIR ONE \nLovett and Bodine jerk awake at the landing. \nANATOLY \n(heavy Russian accent) \nWe are here. \nEXT. / INT. MIR ONE AND TWO \n5 MINUTES LATER: THE TWO SUBS skim over the seafloor to the sound of sidescan sonar and the THRUM of big thrusters. \n6 The featureless gray clay of the bottom unrols in the lights of the subs. Bodine is watching the sidescan sonar display, where the outline of a huge pointed object is visible. Anatoly lies prone, driving the sub, his face pressed to the center port. \nBODINE \nCome left a little. She's right in front of us, eighteen meters. Fifteen. Thirteen... you should see it. \nANATOLY \nDo you see it? I don't see it... there! \nOut of the darkness, like a ghostly apparition, the bow of the ship appears. Its knife-edge prow is coming straight at us, seeming to plow the bottom sediment like ocean waves. It towers above the seafloor, standing just as it landed 84 years ago. \nTHE TITANIC. Or what is left of her. Mir One goes up and over the bow railing, intact except for an overgrowth of \"rusticles\" draping it like mutated Spanish moss. \nTIGHT ON THE EYEPIECE MONITOR of a video camcorder. Brock Lovett's face fills the BLACK AND WHITE FRAME. \nLOVETT \nIt still gets me every time. \nThe image pans to the front viewport, looking over Anatoly's shoulder, to the bow railing visible in the lights beyond. Anatoly turns. \nANATOLY \nIs just your guilt because of estealing from the dead. \nCUT WIDER, to show that Brock is operating the camera himself, turning it in his hand so it points at his own face. \nLOVETT \nThanks, Tolya. Work with me, here. \nBrock resumes his serious, pensive gaze out the front port, with the camera aimed at himself at arm's length. \nLOVETT \nIt still gets me every time... to see the sad ruin of the great ship sitting here, where she landed at 2:30 in the morning, April 15, 1912, after her long fall from the world above. \nAnatoly rolls his eyes and mutters in Russian. Bodine chuckles and watches the sonar. \nBODINE \nYou are so full of shit, boss. \n7 Mir Two drives aft down the starboard side, past the huge anchor while Mir One passes over the seemingly endless forecastle deck, with its massive anchor chains still laid out in two neat rows, its bronze windlass caps gleaming. The 22 foot long subs are like white bugs next to the enormous wreck. \nLOVETT (V.O.) \nDive nine. Here we are again on the deck of Titanic... two and a half miles down. The pressure is three tons per square inch, enough to crush us like a freight train going over an ant if our hull fails. These windows are nine inches thick and if they go, it's sayonara in two microseconds. \n8 Mir Two lands on the boat deck, next to the ruins of the Officer's Quarters. Mir One lands on the roof of the deck hous nearby. \nLOVETT \nRight. Let's go to work. \nBodine slips on a pair of 3-D electronic goggles, and grabs the joystick controls of the ROV. \n9 OUTSIDE THE SUB, the ROV, a small orange and black robot called SNOOP DOG, lifts from its cradle and flies forward. \nBODINE (V.O.) \nWalkin' the dog. \nSNOOP DOG drives itself away from the sub, paying out its umbilical behind it like a robot yo-yo. Its twin stereo-video cameras swivel like insect eyes. The ROV descends through an open shaft that once was the beautiful First Class Grand Staircase. \nSnoop Dog goes down several decks, then moves laterally into the First Class Reception Room. \nSNOOP'S VIDEO POV, moving through the cavernous interior. The remains of the ornate handcarved woodwork which gave the ship its elegance move through the floodlights, the lines blurred by slow dissolution and descending rusticle formations. Stalactites of rust hang down so that at times it looks like a natural grotto, then the scene shifts and the lines of a ghostly undersea mansion can be seen again. \nMONTAGE STYLE, as Snoop passes the ghostly images of Titanic's opulence: \n10 A grand piano in amazingly good shape, crashed on its side against a wall. The keys gleam black and white in the lights. \n11 A chandelier, still hanging from the ceiling by its wire... glinting as Snoop moves around it. \n12 Its lights play across the floor, revealing a champagne bottle, then some WHITE STAR LINE china... a woman's high-top \"granny shoe\". Then something eerie: what looks like a child's skull resolves into the porcelain head of a doll. \nSnoop enters a corridor which is much better preserved. Here and there a door still hangs on its rusted hinges. An ornate piece of molding, a wall sconce... hint at the grandeur of the past. \n13 THE ROV turns and goes through a black doorway, entering room B-52, the sitting room of a \"promenade suite\", one of the most luxurious staterooms on Titanic. \nBODINE \nI'm in the sitting room. Heading for bedroom B-54. \nLOVETT \nStay off the floor. Don't stir it up like you did yesterday. \nBODINE \nI'm tryin' boss. \nGlinting in the lights are the brass fixtures of the near-perfectly preserved fireplace. An albino Galathea crab crawls over it. Nearby are the remains of a divan and a writing desk. The Dog crosses the ruins of the once elegant room toward another DOOR. It squeezes through the doorframe, scraping rust and wood chunks loose on both sides. It moves out of a cloud of rust and keeps on going. \nBODINE \nI'm crossing the bedroom. \nThe remains of a pillared canopy bed. Broken chairs, a dresser. Through the collapsed wall of the bathroom, the porcelain commode and bathtub took almost new, gleaming in the dark. \nLOVETT \nOkay, I want to see what's under that wardrobe door. \nSEVERAL ANGLES as the ROV deploys its MANIPULATOR ARMS and starts moving debris aside. A lamp is lifted, its ceramic colors as bright as they were in 1912. \nLOVETT \nEasy, Lewis. Take it slow. \nLewis grips a wardrobe door, lying at an angle in a corner, and pulls it with Snoop's gripper. It moves reluctantly in a cloud of silt. Under it is a dark object. The silt clears and Snoop's cameras show them what was under the door... \nBODINE \nOoohh daddy-oh, are you seein' what I'm seein'? \nCLOSE ON LOVETT, watching his moniteors. By his expression it is like he is seeing the Holy Grail. \nLOVETT \nOh baby baby baby. \n(grabs the mike) \nIt's payday, boys. \nON THE SCREEN, in the glare of the lights, is the object of their quest: a small STEEL COMBINATION SAFE. \nCUT TO: \n14 EXT. STERN OF DECK OF KEDYSH - DAY \nTHE SAFE, dripping wet in the afternoon sun, is lowered onto the deck of a ship by a winch cable. \nWe are on the Russian research vessel AKADEMIK MISTISLAV KELDYSH. A crowd has gathered, including most of the crew of KELDYSH, the sub crews, and a hand-wringing money guy named BOBBY BUELL who represents the limited partners. There is also a documentary video crew, hired by Lovett to cover his moment of glory. \nROSE \nI was just wondering if you had found the \"Heart of the Ocean\" yet, Mr. Lovett. \nBrock almost drops the phone. Bobby sees his shocked expression... \nBUELL \nI told you you wanted to take this call. \nLOVETT \n(to Rose) \nAlright. You have my attention, Rose. Can you tell me who the woman in the picture is? \nROSE \nOh yes. The woman in the picture is me. \nCUT TO: \n20 EXT. OCEAN - DAY \nSMASH CUT TO AN ENORMOUS SEA STALLION HELICOPTER thundering across the ocean. PAN 180 degrees as it roars past. There is no land at either horizon. The Keldysh is visible in the distance. \nCLOSE ON A WINDOW of the monster helicopter. Rose's face is visible, looking out calmly. \nCUT TO: \n21 EXT. KELDYSH - DAY \nBrock and Bodine are watching Mir 2 being sweng over the side to start a dive. \nBODINE \nShe's a goddamned liar! A nutcase. Like that... what's her name? That Anastasia babe. \nBUELL \nThey're inbound. \nBrock nods and the three of them head forward to meet the approaching helo. \nBODINE \nShe says she's Rose DeWitt Bukater, right? Rose DeWitt Bukater died on the Titanic. At the age of 17. If she'd've lived, she'd be over a hundred now. \nLOVETT \nA hundred and one next month. \nBODINE \nOkay, so she's a very old goddamned liar. I traced her as far back as the 20's... she was working as an actress in L.A. An actress. Her name was Rose Dawson. Then she married a guy named Calvert, moved to Cedar Rapids, had two kids. Now Calvert's dead, and from what I've heard Cedar Rapids is dead. \nThe Sea Stallion approaches the ship, BG, forcing Brock to yell over the rotors. \nLOVETT \nAnd everyobody who knows about the diamond is supposed to be dead... or on this ship. But she knows about it. And I want to hear what she has to say. Got it? \nCUT TO: \n22 EXT. KELDYSH HELIPAD \nIN A THUNDERING DOWNBLAST the helicopter's wheels bounce down on the helipad. \nLovett, Buell and Bodine watch as the HELICOPTER CREW CHIEF hands out about ten suitcases, and then Rose is lowered to the deck in a wheelchair by Keldysh crewmen. Lizzy, ducking unnecessarily under the rotor, follows her out, carrying FREDDY the Pomeranian. The crew chief hands a puzzled Keldysh crewmember a goldfish bowl with several fish in it. Rose does not travel light. \nHOLD ON the incongruous image of this little old lady, looking impossibly fragile amongst all the high tech gear, grungy deck crew and gigantic equipment. \nBODINE \nS'cuse me, I have to go check our supply of Depends. \nCUT TO: \n23 INT. ROSE'S STATEROOM / KELDYSH - DAY \nLizzy is unpacking Rose's things in the small utilitarian room. Rose is placing a number of FRAMED PHOTOS on the bureau, arranging them carefully next to the fishbowl. Brock and Bodine are in the doorway. \nLOVETT \nIs your stateroom alright? \nROSE \nYes. Very nice. Have you met my granddaughter, Lizzy? She takes care of me. \nLIZZY \nYes. We met just a few minutes ago, grandma. Remember, up on deck? \nROSE \nOh, yes. \nBrock glances at Bodine... oh oh. Bodine rolls his eyes. Rose finishes arranging her photographs. We get a general glimpse of them: the usual snapshots... children and grandchildren, her late husband. \nROSE \nThere, that's nice. I have to have my pictures when I travel. And Freddy of course. \n(to the Pomeranian) \nIsn't that right, sweetie. \nLOVETT \nWould you like anything? \nROSE \nI should like to see my drawing. \nCUT TO: \n24 INT. LAB DECK, PRESERVATION AREA \nRose looks at the drawing in its tray of water, confronting herself across a span of 84 years. Until they can figure out the best way to preserve it, they have to keep it immersed. It sways and ripples, almost as if alive. \nTIGHT ON Rose's ancient eyes, gazing at the drawing. \n25 FLASHCUT of a man's hand, holding a conte crayon deftly creating a shoulder and the shape of her hair with two efficient lines. \n26 THE WOMAN'S FACE IN THE DRAWING, dancing under the water. \n27 A FLASHCUT of a man's eyes, just visible over the top of a sketching pad. They look up suddenly right into the LENS. Soft eyes, but fearlessly direct. \n28 Rose smiles, remembering. Brock has the reference photo of the necklace in his hand. \nLOVETT \nLouis the Sixteenth wore a fabulous stone, called the Blue Diamond of the Crown, which disappeared in 1792, about the time Louis lost everything from the neck up. The theory goes that the crown diamond was chopped too... recut into a heart-like shape... and it became Le Coeur de la Mer. The Heart of the Ocean. Today it would be worth more than the Hope Diamond. \nROSE \nIt was a dreadful, heavy thing. \n(she points at the drawing) \nI only wore it this once. \nLIZZY \nYou actually believe this is you, grandma? \nROSE \nIt is me, dear. Wasn't I a hot number? \nLOVETT \nI tracked it down through insurance records... and old claim that was settled under terms of absolute secrecy. Do you know who the claiment was, Rost? \nROSE \nSomeone named Hockley, I should imagine. \nLOVETT \nNathan Hockley, right. Pittsburgh steel tycoon. For a diamond necklace his son Caledon Hockley bought in France for his fiancee... you... a week before he sailed on Titanic. And the claim was filed right after the sinking. So the diamond had to've gone down with the ship. \n(to Lizzy) \nSee the date? \nLIZZY \nApril 14, 1912. \nLOVETT \nIf your grandma is who she says she is, she was wearing the diamond the day Titanic sank. \n(MORE) \nLOVETT (CONT'D) \n(to Rose) \nAnd that makes you my new best friend. I will happily compensate you for anything you can tell us that will lead to its recovery. \nROSE \nA PERSONAL VALET opens the door on the other side of the car for CALEDON HOCKLEY, the 30 year old heir to the elder Hockley's fortune. \"Cal\" is handsome, arrogant and rich beyond meaning. \nCAL \nYou can be blase about some things, Rose, but not about Titanic. It's over a hundred feet longer than Mauretania, and far more luxurious. It has squash courts, a Parisian cafe... even Turkish baths. \nCal turns and fives his hand to Rose's mother, RUTH DEWITT BUKATER, who descends from the touring car being him. Ruth is a 40ish society empress, from one of the most prominent Philadelphia families. She is a widow, and rules her household with iron will. \nCAL \nYour daughter is much too hard to impress, Ruth. \n(indicating a puddle) \nMind your step. \nRUTH \n(gazing at the leviathan) \nSo this is the ship they say is unsinkable. \nCAL \nIt is unsinkable. God himself couldn't sink this ship. \nCal speaks with the pride of a host providing a special experience. \nThis entire entourage of rich Americans is impeccably turned out, a quintessential example of the Edwardian upper class, complete with servants. Cal's VALET, SPICER LOVEJOY, is a tall and impassive, dour as an undertaker. Behind him emerge TWO MAIDS, personal servants to Ruth and Rose. \nA WHITE STAR LINE PORTER scurries toward them, harried by last minute loading. \nPORTER \nSir, you'll have to check your baggage through the main terminal, round that way-- \nCal nonchalantly hands the man a fiver. The porter's eyes dilate. Five pounds was a monster tip in those days. \nCAL \nI put my faith in you, good sir. \n(MORE) \nCAL (CONT'D) \n(curtly, indicating Lovejoy) \nSee my man. \nPORTER \nYes, sir. My pleasure, sir. \nCal never tires of the effect of money on the unwashed masses. \nLOVEJOY \n(to the porter) \nThese trunks here, and 12 more in the Daimler. We'll have all this lot up in the rooms. \nThe White Star man looks stricken when he sees the enormous pile of steamer trunks and suitcases loading down the second car, including wooden crates and steel safe. He whistles frantically for some cargo-handlers nearby who come running. \nCal breezes on, leaving the minions to scramble. He quickly checks his pocket watch. \nCAL \nWe'd better hurry. This way, ladies. \nHe indicates the way toward the first class gangway. They move into the crowd. TRUDY BOLT, Rose's maid, hustles behind them, laden with bags of her mistress's most recent purchases... things too delicate for the baggage handlers. \nCal leads, weaving between vehicles and handcarts, hurrying passengers (mostly second class and steerage) and well-wishers. Most of the first class passengers are avoiding the smelly press of the dockside crowd by using an elevated boarding bridge, twenty feet above. \nThey pass a line of steerage passengers in their coarse wool and tweeds, queued up inside movable barriers like cattle in a chute. A HEALTH OFFICER examines their heads one by one, checking scalp and eyelashes for lice. \nThey pass a well-dressed young man cranking the handle of a wooden Biograph \"cinematograph\" camera mounted on a tripod. NANIEL MARVIN (whose father founded the Biograph Film Studio) is filming his young bride in front of the Titanic. MARY MARVIN stands stiffly and smiles, self conscious. \nDANIEL \nLook up at the ship, darling, that's it. You're amazed! You can't believe how big it is! Like a mountain. That's great. \nMary Marvin, without an acting fiber in her body, does a bad Clara Bow pantomime of awe, hands raised. \nCal is jostled by two yelling steerage boys who shove past him. And he is bumped again a second later by the boys' father. \nCAL \nSteady!! \nMAN \nSorry squire! \nThe Cockney father pushes on, after his kids, shouting. \nCAL \nSteerage swine. Apparently missed his annual bath. \nRUTH \nHonestly, Cal, if you weren't forever booking everything at the last instant, we could have gone through the terminal instead of running along the dock like some squalid immigrant family. \nCAL \nAll part of my charm, Ruth. At any rate, it was my darling fiancee's beauty rituals which made us late. \nROSE \nYou told me to change. \nCAL \nI couldn't let you wear black on sailing day, sweetpea. It's bad luck. \nROSE \nI felt like black. \nCal guides them out of the path of a horse-drawn wagon loaded down with two tons of OXFORD MARMALADE, in wooden cases, for Titanic's Victualling Department. \nCAL \nHere I've pulled every string I could to book us on the grandest ship in history, in her most luxurious suites... and you act as if you're going to your execution. \nRose looks up as the hull of Titanic looms over them...a great iron wall, Bible black and sever. Cal motions her forward, and she enters the gangway to the D Deck doors with a sense of overwhelming dread. \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nIt was the ship of dreams... to everyone else. To me it was a slave ship, taking me back to America in chains. \nCLOSE ON CAL'S HAND IN SLOW-MOTION as it closes possessively over Rose's arm. He escorts her up the gangway and the black hull of Titanic swallows them. \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nOutwardly I was everything a well brought up girl should be. Inside, I was screaming. \n35 CUT TO a SCREAMING BLAST from the mighty triple steam horns on Titanic's funnels, bellowing their departure warning. \nCUT TO: \n36 EXT. SOUTHAMPTON DOCKS / TITANIC - DAY \nA VIEW OF TITANIC from several blocks away, towering above the terminal buildings like the skyline of a city. The steamer's whistle echoes across Southampton. \nPULL BACK, revealing that we were looking through a window, and back further to show the smoky inside of a pub. It is crowded with dockworkers and ship;s crew. \nJust inside the window, a poker game is in progress. FOUR MEN, in working class clothes, play a very serious hand. \nJACK DAWSON and FABRIZIO DE ROSSI, both about 20, exchange a glance as the other two players argue in Swedish. Jack is American, a lanky drifter with his hair a little long for the standards of the times. He is also unshaven, and his clothes are rumpled from sleeping in them. He is an artist, and has adopted the bohemian style of art scene in Paris. He is also very self-possessed and sure-footed for 20, having lived on his own since 15. \nThe TWO SWEDES continue their sullen argument, in Swedish. \nOLAF \n(subtitled) \nYou stupid fishhead. I can't believe you bet our tickets. \nSVEN \n(subtitled) \nYou lost our money. I'm just trying to get it back. Now shutup and take a card. \nJACK \n(jaunty) \nHit me again, Sven. \nJack takes the card and slips it into his hand. \nECU JACK'S EYES. They betray nothing. \nCLOSE ON FABRIZIO licking his lips nervously as he refuses a card. \nECU STACK in the middle of the table. Bills and coins from four counrties. This has been going on for a while. Sitting on top of the money are two 3RD CLASS TICKETS for RMS TITANIC. \nThe Titanic's whistle blows again. Final warning. \nJACK \nThe moment of truth boys. Somebody's life's about to change. \nCUT TO: \n44 EXT. RIVER TEST - DAY \nIN A LONG LENS SHOT the prow of Titanic FILLS FRAME behind the lead tug, which is dwarfed. The bow wave spreads before the mighty plow of the liner's hull as it moves down the River Test toward the English Channel. \nCUT TO: \n45 INT. THIRD CLASS BERTHING / G-DECK FORWARD - DAY \nJack and Fabrizio walk down a narrow corridor with doors lining both sides like a college dorm. Total confusion as people argue over luggage in several languages, or wander in confusion in the labyrinth. They pass emigrants studying the signs over the doors, and looking up the words in phrase books. \nThey find their berth. It is a modest cubicle, painted enamel white, with four bunks. Exposed pipes overhead. The other two guys are already there. OLAUS and BJORN GUNDERSEN. \nJack throws his kit on one open bunk, while Fabrizio takes the other. \nBJORN \n(in Swedish/ subtitled) \nWhere is Sven? \nCUT TO: \n46 INT. SUITE B-52-56 - DAY \nBy contrast, the so-called \"Millionaire Suite\" is in the Empire style, and comprises two bedrooms, a bath, WC, wardrobe room, and a large sitting room. In addition there is a private 50 foot promenade deck outside. \nA room service waiter pours champagne into a tulip glass of orange juice and hands the Bucks Fizz to Rose. She is looking through her new paintings. There is a Monet of water lilies, a Degas of dancers, and a few abstract works. They are all unknown paintings... lost works. \nCal is out on the covered deck, which has potted trees and vines on trellises, talking through the doorway to Rose in the sitting room. \nCAL \nThose mud puddles were certainly a waste of money. \nROSE \n(looking at a cubist portrait) \nYou're wrong. They're fascinating. Like in a dream... there's truth without logic. What's his name again... ? \n(reading off the canvas) \nPicasso. \nCAL \n(coming into the sitting room) \nHe'll never amount to a thing, trust me. At least they were cheap. \nA porter wheels Cal's private safe (which we recognize) into the room on a handtruck. \nCAL \nPut that in the wardrobe. \n47 IN THE BEDROOM Rose enters with the large Degas of the dancers. She sets it on the dresser, near the canopy bed. Trudy is already in there, hanging up some of Rose's clothes. \nTRUDY \nIt smells so brand new. Like they built it all just for us. I mean... just to think that tonight, when I crawl between the sheets, Iill be the first-- \nCal appears in the doorway of the bedroom. \nCAL \n(looking at Rose) \nAnd when I crawl between the sheets tonight, I'll still be the first. \nTRUDY \n(blushing at the innuendo) \nS'cuse me, Miss. \nShe edges around Cal and makes a quick exit. Cal comes up behind Rose and puts his hands on her shoulders. An act of possession, not intimacy. \nCAL \nThe first and only. Forever. \nRose's expression shows how bleak a prospect this is for her, now. \nCUT TO: \n48 EXT. CHERBOURG HARBOR, FRANCE - LATE DUSK \nTitanic stands silhouetted against a purple post-sunset sky. She is lit up like a floating palace, and her thousand portholes reflect in the calm harbor waters. The 150 foot tender Nomadic lies-to alongside, looking like a rowboat. The lights of a Cherbourg harbor complete the postcard image. \nCUT TO: \n49 INT. FIRST CLASS RECEPTION/ D-DECK \nEntering the first class reception room from the tender are a number of prominent passengers. A BROAD-SHOULDERED WOMAN in an enormous feathered hat comes up the gangway, carrying a suitcase in each hand, a spindly porter running to catch up with her to take the bags. \nWOMAN \nWell, I wasn't about to wait all day for you, sonny. Take 'em the rest of the way if you think you can manage. \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nAt Cherbourg a woman came aboard named Margaret Brown, but we all called her Molly. History would call her the Unsinkable Molly Brown. Her husband had struck gold someplace out west, and she was what mother called \"new money\". \nAt 45, MOLLY BROWN is a tough talking straightshooter who dresses in the finery of her genteel peers but will never be one of them. \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nBy the next afternoon we had made our final stop and we were steaming west from the coast of Ireland, with nothing out ahead of us but ocean... \nCUT TO: \n50 OMITTED \n51 EXT. BOW - DAY \nThe ship glows with the warm creamy light of late afternoon. Jack and Fabrizio stand right at the bow gripping the curving railing so familiar from images of the wreck. Jack leans over, looking down fifty feet to where the prow cuts the surface like a knife, sending up two glassy sheets of water. \nCUT TO: \n52 INT. / EXT. TITANIC - SERIES OF SCENES - DAY \nON THE BRIDGE, CAPTAIN SMITH turns from the binnacle to FIRST OFFICER WILLIAM MURDOCH. \nCAPTAIN SMITH \nTake her to sea Mister Murdoch. Let's stretch her legs. \nMurdoch moves the engine telegraph lever to ALL AHEAD FULL. \n53 NOW BEGINS a kind of musical/visual setpiece... an ode to the great ship. The music is rhythmic, surging forward, with a soaring melody that addresses the majesty and optimism of the ship of dreams. \nIN THE ENGINE ROOM the telegraph clangs and moves to \"All Ahead Full\". \nCHIEF ENGINEER BELL \nAll ahead full! \nOn the catwalk THOMAS ANDREWS, the shipbuilder, watches carefully as the engineers and greasers scramble to adjust valves. Towering above them are the twin RECIPROCATING engines, four stories tall, their ten-foot-long connecting rods surging up and down with the turning of the massive crankshafts. The engines thunder like the footfalls of marching giants. \n54 IN THE BOILER ROOMS the STOKERS chant a song as they hurl coal into the roaring furnaces. The \"black gang\" are covered with sweat and coal dust, their muscles working like part of the machinery as they toil in the hellish glow. \n55 UNDERWATER the enormous bronze screws chop through the water, hurling the steamer forward and churning up a vortex of foam that lingers for miles behind the juggernaut ship. Smoke pours from the funnels as-- \n56 The riven water flares higher at the bow as the ship's speeds builds. THE CAMERA SWEEPS UP the prow to find Jack, the wind streaming through his hair and-- \n57 Captain Smith steps out of the enclosed bridge onto the wing. He stands with his hands on the rail, looking every bit the storybook picture of a Captain... a great patriarch of the sea. \nFIRST OFFICER MURDOCH \nTwenty one knots, sir! \nSMITH \nShe's got a bone in her teeth now, eh, Mr. Murdoch. \nSmith accepts a cup of tea from FIFTH OFFICER LOWE. He contentedly watches the white V of water hurled outward from the bows like an expression of his own personal power. They are invulnerable, towering over the sea. \n58 AT THE BOW Jack and Fabrizio lean far over, looking down. \nIn the glassy bow-wave two dolphins appear, under the water, running fast just in front of the steel blade of the prow. They do it for the sheer joy and exultation of motion. Jack watches the dolphins and grins. They breach, jumping clear of the water and then dive back, crisscrossing in front of the bow, dancing ahead of the juggernaut. \nFABRIZIO looks forward across the Atlantic, staring into the sunsparkles. \nFABRIZIO \nI can see the Statue of Liberty already. \n(grinning at Jack) \nVery small... of course. \nTHE CAMERA ARCS around them, until they are framed against the sea. \nNOW WE PULL BACK, across the forecastle deck. Rising, as we continue back, and the ships rolls endlessly forward underneath. Over the bridge wing, along the boat deck until her funnels come INTO FRAME besides us and march past like the pillars of heaven, one by one. We pull back and up, until we are looking down the funnels, and the people strolling on the decks and standing at the rail become antlike. \nAnd still we pull back until the great lady is seen whole in a gorgeous aerial portrait, black and severe in her majesty. \nISMAY (V.O.) \nShe is the largest moving object ever made by the hand of man in all history... \nCUT TO: \nDon't do it. \nShe whips her head around at the sound of his voice. It takes a second for her eyes to focus. \nROSE \nStay back! Don't come any closer! \nJack sees the tear tracks on her cheeks in the faint glow from the stern running lights. \nJACK \nTake my hand. I'll pull you back in. \nROSE \nNo! Stay where you are. I mean it. I'll let go. \nJACK \nNo you won't. \nROSE \nWhat do you mean no I won't? Don't presume to tell me what I will and will not do. You don't know me. \nJACK \nYou would have done it already. Now come on, take my hand. \nRose is confused now. She can't see him very well through the tears, so she wipes them with one hand, almost losing her balance. \nROSE \nYou're distracting me. Go away. \nJACK \nI can't. I'm involved now. If you let go I have to jump in after you. \nROSE \nDon't be absurd. You'll be killed. \nHe takes off his jacket. \nJACK \nI'm a good swimmer. \nHe starts unlacing his left shoe. \nROSE \nThe fall alone would kill you. \nJACK \nIt would hurt. I'm not saying it wouldn't. To be honest I'm a lot more concerned about the water being so cold. \nShe looks down. The reality factor of what she is doing is sinking in. \nROSE \nHow cold? \nJACK \n(taking off his left shoe) \nFreezing. Maybe a couple degrees over. \nHe starts unlacing his right shoe. \nJACK \nEver been to Wisconsin? \nROSE \n(perplexed) \nNo. \nJACK \nWell they have some of the coldest winters around, and I grew up there, near Chippewa Falls. Once when I was a kid me and my father were ice-fishing out on Lake Wissota... ice-fishing's where you chop a hole in the-- \nROSE \nI know what ice fishing is! \nJACK \nSorry. Just... you look like kind of an indoor girl. Anyway, I went through some thin ice and I'm tellin' ya, water that cold... like that right down there... it hits you like a thousand knives all over your body. You can't breath, you can't think... least not about anything but the pain. \n(takes off his other shoe) \nWhich is why I'm not looking forward to jumping in after you. But like I said, I don't see a choice. I guess I'm kinda hoping you'll come back over the rail and get me off the hook here. \nROSE \nYou're crazy. \nJACK \nThat's what everybody says. But with all due respect, I'm not the one hanging off the back of a ship. \nHe slides one step closer, like moving up on a spooked horse. \nJACK \nCome on. You don't want to do this. Give me your hand. \nRose stares at this madman for a long time. She looks at his eyes and they somehow suddenly seem to fill her universe. \nROSE \nAlright. \nShe unfastens one hand from the rail and reaches it around toward him. He reaches out to take it, firmly. \nJACK \nI'm Jack Dawson. \nROSE \n(voice quavering) \nPleased to meet you, Mr. Dawson. \nRose starts to turn. Now that she has decided to live, the height is terrifying. She is overcome by vertigo as she shifts her footing, turning to face the ship. As she starts to climb, her dress gets in the way, and one foot slips off the edge of the deck. \nShe plunges, letting out a piercing SHRIEK. Jack, gripping her hand, is jerked toward the rail. Rose barely grabs a lower rail with her free hand. \nQUARTERMASTER ROWE, up on the docking bridge hears the scream and heads for the ladder. \nROSE \nHELP! HELP!! \nJACK \nI've got you. I won't let go. \nJack holds her hand with all his strength, bracing himself on the railing with his other hand. Rose tries to get some kind of foothold on the smooth hull. Jack tries to lift her bodily over the railing. She can't get any footing in her dress and evening shoes, and she slips back. Rose SCREAMS again. \nJack, awkwardly clutching Rose by whatever he can get a grip on as she flails, gets her over the railing. They fall together onto the deck in a tangled heap, spinning in such a way that Jack winds up slightly on top of her. \nRowe slides down the ladder from the docking bridge like it's a fire drill and sprints across the fantail. \nROWE \nHere, what's all this?! \nRowe runs up and pulls Jack off of Rose, revealing her dishevelled and sobbing on the deck. Her dress is torn, and the hem is pushing up above her knees, showing one ripped stocking. He looks at Jack, the shaggy steerage man with his jacket off, and the first class lady clearly in distress, and starts drawing conclusions. Two seamen chug across the deck to join them. \nROWE \n(to Jack) \nHere you, stand back! Don't move an inch! \n(to the seamen) \nFetch the Master at Arms. \nCUT TO: \n66 EXT. POOP DECK - NIGHT \nA few minutes later. Jack is being detained by the burly MASTER AT ARMS, the closest thing to a cop on board. He is handcuffing Jack. Cal is right in front of Jack, and furious. He has obviously just rushed out here with Lovejoy and another man, and none of them have coats over their black tie evening dress. The other man is COLONEL ARCHIBALD GRACIE, a mustachioed blowhard who still has his brandy snifter. He offers it to Rose, who is hunched over crying on a bench nearby, but she waves it away. Cal is more concerned with Jack. He grabs him by the lapels. \nCAL \nWhat made you think you could put your hands on my fiancee?! Look at me, you filth! What did you think you were doing?! \nROSE \nCal, stop! It was an accident. \nCAL \nAn accident?! \nLOVETT \nWell, that's the general idea, my dear. \nBODINE \nSo let me get this right. You were gonna kill yourself by jumping off the Titanic? \n(he guffaws) \nThat's great! \nLOVETT \n(warningly) \nLewis... \nBut Rose laughs with Bodine. \nBODINE \n(still laughing) \nAll you had to do was wait two days! \nLovett, standing out of Rose's sightline, checks his watch. Hours have passed. This process is taking too long. \nLOVETT \nRose, tell us more about the diamond. What did Hockley do with it after that? \nROSE \nIm afraid I'm feeling a little tired, Mr. Lovett. \nLizzy picks up the cue and starts to wheel her out. \nLOVETT \nWait! Can you give us something go on, here. Like who had access to the safe. What about this Lovejoy guy? The valet. Did he have the combination? \nLIZZY \nThat's enough. \nLizzy takes her out. Rose's old hand reapears at the doorway in a frail wave goodbye. \nCUT TO: \n69 EXT. LAUNCH AREA/KELDYSH DECK - DAY \nAs the big hydraulic jib swings one of the Mir subs out over the water. Lovett walks as he talks with Bobby Buell, the partners' rep. They weave among deck cranes, launch crew, sub maintenance guys. \nBUELL \nThe partners are pissed. \nBROCK \nBobby, buy me time. I need time. \nBUELL \nWe're running thirty thousand a day, and we're six days over. I'm telling you what they're telling me. The hand is on the plug. It's starting to pull. \nBROCK \nWell you tell the hand I need another two days! Bobby, Bobby, Bobby... we're close! I smell it. I smell ice. She had the diamond on... now we just have to find out where it wound up. I just gotta work her a bit more. Okay? \nBrock turns and sees Lizy standing behind him. She has overheard the past part of his dialogue with Buell. He goes to her and hustles her away from Buell, toward a quite spot on the deck. \nBROCK \nHey, Lizzy. I need to talk to you for a second. \nLIZZY \nDon't you mean work me? \nBROCK \nLook, I'm running out of time. I need your help. \nLIZZY \nI'm not going to help you browbeat my hundred and \n(MORE) \nLIZZY (CONT'D) \none year old grandmother. I came down here to tell you to back off. \nBROCK \n(with undisguised desperation) \nLizzy... you gotta understand something. I've bet it all to find the Heart of the Ocean. I've got all my dough tied up in this thing. My wife even divorced me over this hunt. I need what's locked inside your grandma's memory. \n(he holds out his hand) \nYou see this? Right here? \nShe looks at his hand, palm up. Empty. Cupped, as if around an imaginary shape. \nLIZZY \nWhat? \nBROCK \nThat's the shape my hand's gonna be when I hold that thing. You understand? I'm not leaving here without it. \nLIZZY \nLook, Brock, she's going to do this her way, in her own time. Don't forget, she contacted you. She's out here for her own reasons, God knows what they are. \nLOVETT \nMaybe she wants to make peace with the past. \nLIZZY \nWhat past? She has never once, not once, ever said a word about being on the Titanic until two days ago. \nLOVETT \nThen we're all meeting your grandmother for the first time. \nLIZZY \n(looks at him hard) \nYou think she was really there? \nLOVETT \nOh, yeah. Yeah, I'm a believer. She was there. \nCUT TO: \n70 INT. IMAGING SHACK \nBodine starts the tape recorder. Rose is gazing at the screen seeing THE LIVE FEED FROM THE WRECK--SNOOP DOG is moving along the starboard side of the hull, heading aft. The rectangular windows of A deck (forward) march past on the right. \nROSE \nThe next day, Saturday, I remember thinking how the sunlight felt. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n71 EXT. B DECK TITANIC - DAY \nMATCH DISSOLVE from the rusting hulk to the gleaming new Titanic in 1912, passing the end of the enclosed promenade just as Rose walks into the sunlight right in front of us. She is stunningly dressed and walking with purpose. \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nAs if I hadn't felt the sun in years. \nIT IS SATURDAY APRIL 13, 1912. Rose unlatches the gate to go down into third class. The steerage men on the deck stop what they're doing and stare at her. \nCUT TO: \n72 INT. THIRD CLASS GENERAL ROOM \nThe social center of steerage life. It is stark by comparison to the opulence of first class, but is a loud, boisterous place. There are mothers with babies, kids running between the benches yelling in several languages and being scolded in several more. There are old women yelling, men playing chess, girls doing needlepoint and reading dime novels. There is even an upright piano and Tommy Ryan is noodling around it. \nThree boys, shrieking and shouting, are scrambling around chasing a rat under the benches, trying to whomp it with a shoe and causing general havoc. Jack is playing with 5 year old CORA CARTMeLL, drawing funny faces together in his sketchbook. \nFabrizio is struggling to get a conversation going with an attractive Norwegian girl, HELGA DAHL, sitting with her family at a table across the room. \nFABRIZIO \nNo Italian? Some little English? \nHELGA \nNo, no. Norwegian. Only. \nHelga's eye is caught by something. Fabrizio looks, does a take... and Jack, curious, follows their gaze to see... \nRose, coming toward them. The activity in the room stops... a hush falls. Rose feels suddenly self-conscious as the steerage passengers stare openly at this princess, some with resentment, others with awe. She spots Jack and gives a little smile, walking straight to him. He rises to meet her, smiling. \nROSE \nShe goes back to the book, turning a page. \nROSE \nWell, well... \nShe has come upon a series of nudes. Rose is transfixed by the languid beauty he has created. His nudes are soulful, real, with expressive hands and eyes. They feel more like portraits than studies of the human form... almost uncomfortably intimate. Rose blushes, raising the book as some strollers go by. \nROSE \n(trying to be very adult) \nAnd these were drawn from life? \nJACK \nYup. That's one of the great things about Paris. Lots of girls willing take their clothes off. \nShe studies one drawing in particular, the girl posed half in sunlight, half in shadow. Her hands lie at her chin, one furled and one open like a flower, languid and graceful. The drawing is like an Alfred Steiglitz print of Georgia O'Keefe. \nROSE \nYou liked this woman. You used her several times. \nJACK \nShe had beautiful hands. \nROSE \n(smiling) \nI think you must have had a love affair with her... \nJACK \n(laughing) \nNo, no! Just with her hands. \nROSE \n(looking up from the drawings) \nYou have a gift, Jack. You do. You see people. \nJACK \nI see you. \nThere it is. That piercing gaze again. \nROSE \nAnd...? \nJACK \nYou wouldn'ta jumped. \nCUT TO: \n74 INT. RECEPTION ROOM / D-DECK - DAY \nRuth is having tea with NOEL LUCY MARTHA DYER-EDWARDES, the COUNTESS OF ROTHES, a 35ish English blue-blood with patirician features. Ruth sees someone coming across the room and lowers her voice. \nRUTH \nOh no, that vulgar Brown woman is coming this way. Get up, quickly before she sits with us. \nMolly Brown walks up, greeting them cheerfully as they are rising. \nMOLLY \nHello girls, I was hoping I'd catch you at tea. \nRUTH \nWe're awfully sorry you missed it. The Countess and I are just off to take the air on the boat deck. \nMOLLY \nThat sounds great. Let's go. I need to catch up on the gossip. \nRuth grits her teeth as the three of them head for the Grand Staircase to go up. TRACKING WITH THEM, as they cross the room, the SHOT HANDS OFF to Bruce Ismay and Captain Smith at another table. \nISMAY \nSo you've not lit the last four boilers then? \nSMITH \nNo, but we're making excellent time. \nISMAY \n(impatiently) \nCaptain, the press knows the size of Titanic, let them marvel at her speed too. We must give them something new to print. And the maiden voyage of Titnaic must make headlines! \nSMITH \nI prefer not to push the engines until they've been properly run in. \nISMAY \nOf course I leave it to your good offices to decide what's best, but what a glorious end to your last crossing if we get into New York Tuesday night and surprise them all. \n(Ismay slaps his hand on the table) \nRetire with a bang, eh, E.J? \nA beat. Then Smith nods, stiffy. \nCUT TO: \n75 EXT. A DECK PROMENADE - DAY \nRose and Jack stroll aft, past people lounging on deck chairs in the slanting late-afternoon light. Stewards scurry to serve tea or hot cocoa. \nROSE \n(girlish and excited) \nYou know, my dream has always been to just chuck it all and become an artist... living in a garret, poor but free! \nJACK \n(laughing) \nYou wouldn't last two days. There's no hot water, and hardly ever any caviar. \nROSE \n(angry in a flash) \nListen, buster... I hate caviar! And I'm tired of people dismissing my dreams with a chuckle and a pat on the head. \nJACK \nI'm sorry. Really... I am. \nROSE \nWell, alright. There's something in me, Jack. I feel it. I don't know what it is, whether I should be an artist, or, I don't know... a dancer. Like Isadora Duncan.... a wild pagan spirit... \nShe leaps forward, lands deftly and whirls like a dervish. Then she sees something ahead and her face lights up. \nROSE \n...or a moving picture actress! \nShe takes his hand and runs, pulling him along the deck toward-- \nDANIEL AND MARY MARVIN. Daniel is cranking the big wooden movie camera as she poses stiffly at the rail. \nMARVIN \nYou're sad. Sad, sad, sad. You've left your lover on the shore. You may never see him agian. Try to be sadder, darling. \nSUDDENLY Rose shoots into the shot and strikes a theatrical pose at the rail next to Mary. Mary bursts out laughing. Rose pulls Jack into the picture and makes him pose. \nMarvin grins and starts yelling and gesturing. We see this in CUTS, with music and no dialogue. \nSERIES OF CUTS: \nRose posing tragically at the rail, the back of her hand to her forehead. \nJack on a deck chair, pretending to be a Pasha, the two girls pantomiming fanning him like slave girls. \nJack, on his knees, pleading with his hands clasped while Rose, standing, turns her head in bored disdain. \nRose cranking the camera, while Daniel and Jack have a western shoot-out. Jack wins and leers into the lens, twirling an air mustache like Snidely Whiplash. \nCUT TO: \n76 EXT. A DECK PROMENADE / AFT - SUNSET \nPainted with orange light, Jack and Rose lean on the A-deck rail aft, shoulder to shoulder. The ship's lights come on. \nIt is a magical moment... perfect. \nROSE \nSo then what, Mr. Wandering Jack? \nCAL \n(caught off guard) \nDawson! I didn't recognize you. \n(studies him) \nAmazing! You could almost pass for a gentlemen. \nCUT TO: \n80 INT. D-DECK RECEPTION ROOM \nCUT TO THE RECEPTION ROOM ON D DECK, as the party descends to dinner. They encounter Molly Brown, looking good in a beaded dress, in her own busty broad-shouldered way. Molly grins when she sees Jack. As they are going into the dining saloon she walks next to him, speaking low: \nMOLLY \nAin't nothin' to it, is there, Jack? \nJACK \nYeah, you just dress like a pallbearer and keep your nose up. \nMOLLY \nRemember, the only thing they respect is money, so just act like you've got a lot of it and you're in the club. \nAs they enter the swirling throng, Rose leans close to him, pointing out several notables. \nROSE \nThere's the Countess Rothes. And that's John Jacob Astor... the richest man on the ship. His little wifey there, Madeleine, is my age and in a delicate condition. See how she's trying to hide it. Quite the scandal. \n(nodding toward a couple) \nAnd over there, that's Sir Cosmo and Lucile, Lady Duff-Gordon. She designs naughty lingerie, among her many talents. Very popular with the royals. \nCal becomes engrossed in a conversations with Cosmo Duff-Gordon and Colonel Gracie, while Ruth, the Countess and Lucille discuss fashion. Rose picots Jack smoothly, to show him another couple, dressed impeccably. \nROSE \nAnd that's Benjamin Guggenheim and his mistress, Madame Aubert. Mrs. Guggenheim is at home with the children, of course. \nCal, meanwhile, is accepting the praise of his male counterparts, who are looking at Rose like a prize show horse. \nSIR COSMO \nHockley, she is splendid. \nCAL \nThank you. \nGRACIE \nCal's a lucky man. I know him well, and it can only be luck. \nRuth steps over, hearing the last. She takes Cal's arm, somewhat coquettishly. \nRUTH \nHow can you say that Colonel? Caledon Hockley is a great catch. \nThe entourage strolls toward the dining saloon, where they run into the Astor's going through the ornate double doors. \nROSE \nJ.J., Madeleine, I'd like you to meet Jack Dawson. \nASTOR \n(shaking his hand) \nGood to meet you Jack. Are you of the Boston Dawsons? \nJACK \nNo, the Chippewa Falls Dawsons, actually. \nJ.J. nods as if he's heard of them, then looks puzzled. Madeleine Astor appraises Jack and whispers girlishly to Rose: \nMADELEINE \nIt's a pity we're both spoken for, isn't it? \nCUT TO: \n81 INT. DINING SALOON \nLike a ballroom at the palace, alive and lit by a constellation of chandeliers, full of elegantly dressed people and beautiful music from BANDLEADER WALLACE HARTLEY'S small orchestra. As Rose and Jack enter and move across the room to their table, Cal and Ruth beside them, we hear... \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nHe must have been nervous but he never faltered. They assumed he was one of them... a young captain of industry perhaps... new money, obviously, but still a memeber of the club. Mother of course, could always be counted upon... \nCUT TO: \n82 INT. DINING SALOON \nCLOSE ON RUTH. \nRUTH \nTell us of the accommodations in steerage, Mr. Dawson. I hear they're quite good on this ship. \nWIDER: THE TABLE. Jack is seated opposite Rose, who is flanked by Cal and Thomas Andrews. Also at the table are Molly Brown, Ismay, Colonel Gracie, the Countess, Guggenheim, Madame Aubert, and the Astors. \nJACK \nThe best I've seen, m'am. Hardly any rats. \nRose motions surreptitiously for Jack to take his napkin off his plate. \nCAL \nMr. Dawson is joining us from third class. He was of some assistance to my fiancee last night. \n(to Jack, as if to a child) \nThis is foie gras. It's goose liver. \nWe see whispers exchanged. Jack becomesthe subject of furtive glances. Now they're all feeling terribly liberal and dangerous. \nGUGGENHEIM \n(low to Madame Aubert) \nWhat is Hockly hoping to prove, bringing this... bohemian... up here? \nWAITER \n(to Jack) \nHow do you take your caviar, sir? \nCAL \n(answering for him) \nJust a soupcon of lemon... \n(to Jack, smiling) \n...it improves the flavor with champagne. \nJACK \n(to the waiter) \nNo caviar for me, thanks. \n(to Cal) \nNever did like it much. \nHe looks at Rose, pokerfaced, and she smiles. \nRUTH \nAnd where exactly do you live, Mr. Dawson? \nJACK \nWell, right now my address is the RMS Titanic. After that, I'm on God's good humor. \nSalad is served. Jack reaches for the fish fork. Rose gives him a look and picks up the salad fork, prompting him with her eyes. He changes forks. \nRUTH \nYou find that sort of rootless existence appealing, do you? \nJACK \nWell... it's a big world, and I want to see it all before I go. My father was always talkin' about goin' to see the ocean. He died in the town he was born in, and never did see it. You can't wait around, because you never know what hand you're going to get dealt next. See, my folks died in a fire when I was fifteen, and I've been on the road since. Somethin' like that teaches you to take life as it comes at you. To make each day count. \nMolly Brown raises her glass in a salute. \nMOLLY \nWell said, Jack. \nCOLONEL GRACIE \n(raising his glass) \nEverybody else is dancing again, and Bjorn Gundersen crashes into Tommy, who sloshes his beer over Rose's dress. She laughs, not caring. But Tommy lunges, grabbing Bjorn and wheeling him around. \nTOMMY \nYou stupid bastard!! \nBjorn comes around, his fists coming up... and Jack leaps into the middle of it, pushing them apart. \nJACK \nBoys, boys! Did I ever tell you the one about the Swede and the Irishman goin' to the whorehouse? \nTommy stands there, all piss and vinegar, chest puffed up. Then he grins and claps Bjorn on the shoulder. \nROSE \nSo, you think you're big tough men? Let's see you do this. \nIn her stocking feet she assumes a ballet stance, arms raised, and goes up on point, taking her entire weight on the tips of her toes. The guys gape at her incredible muscle control. She comes back down, then her face screws up in pain. She grabs one foot, hopping around. \nROSE \nOooowww! I haven't done that in years. \nJack catches her as she loses her balance, and everyone cracks up. \nTHE DOOR to the well deck is open a few inches as Lovejoy watches through the gap. He sees Jack holding Rose, both of them laughing. \nLOVEJOY closes the door. \nCUT TO: \n88 EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT \nThe stars blaze overhead, so bright and clear you can see the Milky Way. Rose and Jack walk along the row of lifeboats. Still giddy from the party, they are singing a popular song \"Come Josephine in My Flying Machine\". \nJACK/ROSE \nCome Josephine in my flying machine \nAnd it's up she goes! Up she goes! \nIn the air she goes. Where? There she goes! \nThey fumble the words and break down laughing. They have reached the First Class Entrance, but don't go straight in, not wanting the evening to end. Through the doors the sound of the ship's orchestra wafts gently. Rose grabs a davit and leans back, staring at the cosmos. \nROSE \nIsn't it magnificent? So grand and endless. \nShe goes to the rail and leans on it. \nROSE \nThey're such small people, Jack... my crowd. They think they're giants on the earth, but they're not even dust in God's eye. They live inside this little tiny champagne bubble... and someday the bubble's going to burst. \nHe leans at the rail next to her, his hand just touching hers. It is the slightest contact imaginable, and all either one of them can feel is that square inch of skin where their hands are touching. \nJACK \nYou're not one of them. There's been a mistake. \nROSE \nA mistake? \nJACK \nUh huh. You got mailed to the wrong address. \nROSE \n(laughing) \nI did, didn't I? \n(MORE) \nROSE (CONT'D) \n(pointing suddenly) \nLook! A shooting star. \nJACK \nThat was a long one. My father used to say that whenever you saw one, it was a soul going to heaven. \nROSE \nI like that. Aren't we supposed to wish on it? \nJack looks at her, and finds that they are suddenly very close together. It would be so easy to move another couple of inches, to kiss her. Rose seems to be thinking the same thing. \nJACK \nWhat would you wish for? \nAfter a beat, Rose pulls back. \nROSE \nSomething I can't have. \n(she smiles sadly) \nGoodnight, Jack. And thank you. \nShe leaves the rail and hurries through the First Class Entrance. \nJACK \nRose!! \nBut the door bangs shut, and she is gone. Back to her world. \nCUT TO: \n89 INT. ORSE AND CAL'S SUITE / PRIVATE PROMENADE - DAY \nSUNDAY APRIL 14, 1912. A bright clear day. Sunlight splashing across the promenade. Rose and Cal are having breakfast in silence. The tension is palpable. Trudy Bolt, in her maid's uniform, pours the coffee and goes inside. \nCAL \nI had hoped you would come to me last night. \nROSE \nI was tired. \nCAL \nYes. Your exertions below decks were no doubt exausting. \nROSE \n(stiffening) \nI see you had that undertaker of a manservant follow me. \nCAL \nYou will never behave like that again! Do you understand? \nROSE \nI'm not some foreman in your mills than you can command! I am your fiancee-- \nCal explodes, sweeping the breakfast china off the table with a crash. He moves to her in one shocking moment, glowering over her and gripping the sides of her chair, so she is trapped between his arms. \nCAL \nYes! You are! And my wife... in practice, if not yet by law. So you will honor me, as a wife is required to honor her husband! I will not be made out a fool! Is this in any way unclear? \nRose shrinks into the chair. She sees Trudy, frozen, partway through the door bringing the orange juice. Cal follows Rose's glance and straightens up. He stalks past the maid, entering the stateroom. \nROSE \nWe... had a little accident. I'm sorry, Trudy. \nCUT TO: \n90 INT. RUTH'S SUITE - DAY \nRose is dressed for the day, and is in the middle of helping Ruth with her corset. The tight bindings do not inhibit Ruth's fury at all. \nRUTH \nYou are not to see that boy again, do you understand me Rose? I forbid it! \nRose has her knee at the base of her mother's back and is pulling the corset strings with both hands. \nROSE \nOh, stop it, Mother. You'll give yourself a nosebleed. \nRuth pulls away from her, and crosses to the door, locking it. CLACK! \nRUTH \n(wheeling on her) \nRose, this is not a game! Our situation is precarious. You know the money's gone! \nROSE \nFIRST OFFICER MURDOCH \nHaven't seen them since Southampton. \nCUT TO: \n96 EXT. BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE - DAY \nAndrews leads the group back from the bridge along the boat deck. \nROSE \nMr. Andrews, I did the sum in my head, and with the number of lifeboats times the capacity you mentioned... forgive me, but it seems that there are not enough for everyone aboard. \nANDREWS \nAbout half, actually. Rose, you miss nothing, do you? In fact, I put in these new type davits, which can take an extra row of boats here. \n(he gestures along the eck) \nBut it was thought... by some... that the deck would look too cluttered. So I was over-ruled. \nCAL \n(slapping the side of a boat) \nWaste of deck space as it is, on an unsinkable ship! \nANDREWS \nSleep soundly, young Rose. I have built you a good ship, strong and true. She's all the lifeboat you need. \nAs they are passing Boat 7, a gentlemen turns from the rail and walks up behind the group. It is Jack. He taps Rose on the arm and she turns, gasping. He motions and she cuts away from the group toward a door which Jack holds open. They duck into the-- \nCUT TO: \n97 INT. GYMNASIUM - DAY \nJack closes the door behind her, and glances out through the ripple-glass window to the starboard rail, where the gym instructor is chatting up the woman who was riding the bike. Rose and Jack are alone in the room. \nROSE \nJack, this is impossible. I can't see you. \nHe takes her by the shoulders. \nJACK \nRose, you're no picnic... you're a spoiled little brat even, but under that you're a strong, pure heart, and you're the most amazingly astounding girl I've ever known and-- \nROSE \nJack, I-- \nJACK \nNo wait. Let me try to get this out. You're amazing... and I know I have nothing to offer you, Rose. I know that. But I'm involved now. You jump, I jump, remember? I can't turn away without knowin' that you're goin' to be alright. \nRose feels the tears coming to her eyes. Jack is so open and real... not like anyone she has ever known. \nROSE \nYou're making this very hard. I'll be fine. Really. \nJACK \nI don't think so. They've got you in a glass jar like some butterfly, and you're goin' to die if you don't break out. Maybe not right away, 'cause you're strong. But sooner or later the fire in you is goin' to go out. \nROSE \nIt's not up to you to save me, Jack. \nJACK \nYou're right. Only you can do that. \nROSE \nI have to get back, they'll miss me. Please, Jack, for both our sakes, leave me alone. \nCUT TO: \n98 INT. FIRST CLASS LOUNG - DAY \nThe most elegant room on the ship, done in Louis Quinze Versaille style. Rose sits on a divan, with a group of other women arrayed around her. Ruth, the Countess Rothes and Lady Duff-Gordon are taking tea. Rose is silent and still as a porcelain figurine as the conversation washes around her. \nRUTH \nOf course the invitations had to be sent back to the printers twice. And the bridesmaids dresses! Let me tell you what an odyssey that has been... \nTRACKING SLOWLY IN on Rose as Ruth goes on. \nREVERSE, ROSE'S POV: A tabeau of MOTHER and DAUGHTER having tea. The four year old girl, wearing white gloves, daintily picking up a cookie. The mother correcting her on her posture, and the way she holds the teacup. The little girl is trying so hard to please, her expression serious. A glimpse of Rose at that age, and we see the relentless conditioning... the pain to becoming an Edwardian geisha. \nON ROSE. She calmly and deliberately turns her teacup over, spilling tea all over her dress. \nROSE \nOh, look what I've done. \nCUT TO: \n99 EXT. TITANIC - DAY \nTITANIC STEAMS TOWARD US, in the dusk light, as if lit by the embers of a giant fire. As the ship looms, FILLING FRAME, we push in on the bow. Jack is there, right at the apex of the bow railing, his favorite spot. He closes his eyes, letting the chill wind clear his head. \nJack hears her voice, behind him... \nROSE \nHello, Jack. \nHe turns and she is standing there. \nROSE \nI changed my mind. \nHe smiles at her, his eyes drinking her in. Her cheeks are red with the chill wind, and her eyes sparkle. Her hair blows wildly about her face. \nROSE \nFabrizio said you might be up-- \nJACK \nSssshh. Come here. \nHe puts his hands on her waist. As if he is going to kiss her. \nJACK \nClose your eyes. \nShe does, and he turns her to face forward, the way the ship is going. He presses her gently to the rail, standing right behind her. Then he takes her two hands and raises them until she is standing with her arms outstetched on each side. Rose is going along with him. When he lowers his hands, her arms stay up... like wings. \nJACK \nOkay. Open them. \nRose gasps. There is nothing in her field of vision but water. It's like there is no ship under them at all, just the two of them soaring. The Atlantic unrolls toward her, a hammered copper shield under a dusk sky. There is only the wind, and the hiss of the water 50 feel below. \nROSE \nI'm flying! \nShe leans forward, arching her back. He puts his hands on her waist to steady her. \nJACK \n(singing softly) \nCome Josephine in my flying machine... \nRose cleses her eyes, feeling herself floating weightless far above the sea. She smiles dreamily, then leans back, gently pressing her back against his chest. He pushes forward slightly against her. \nSlowly he raises his hands, arms outstretched, and they meet hers... fingertips gently touching. Then their fingers intertwine. Moving slowly, their fingers caress through and around each other like the bodies of two lovers. \nJack tips his face forward into her blowing hair, letting the scent of her wash over him, until his cheek is agianst her ear. \nRose turns her head until her lips are near his. She lowers her arms, turning further, until she finds his mouth with hers. He wraps his arms around her from behind, and they kiss like this with her head turned and tilted back, surrendering to him, to the emotion, to the inevitable. They kiss, slowly and tremulously, and then with building passion. \nJack and the ship seem to merge into one force of power and optimism, lifting her, buoying her forward on a magical journey, soaring onward into a night without fear. \n100 IN THE CROW'S NEST, high above and behind them, lookout FREDERICK FLEET nudges his mate, REGINALD LEE, pointing down at the figures in the bow. \nFLEET \nWish I had those bleedin' binoculars. \n101 JACK AND ROSE, embracing at the bow rail, DISSOLVE SLOWLY AWAY, leaving the ruined bow of the WRECK-- \nCUT TO: \n102 INT. KELDYSH IMAGING SHACK \nOLD ROSE blinks, seeming to come back to the present. She sees the wreck on the screen, the sad ghost ship deep in the abyss. \nROSE \nThat was the last time Titanic ever saw daylight. \nBrock Lovett changes the tape in the minicassette recorder. \nBROCK \n(uncertain) \nHe couldn't have. \nCAL \nOf course he could. Easy enough for a professional. He memorized the combination when you opend the safe. \nFLASHBACK: Rose at the safe, looking in the mirror and meeting Jack's eyes as he stands behind her, watching. \nROSE \nBut I was with him the whole time. \nCAL \n(just to her, low and cold) \nMaybe he did it while you were putting your clothes back on. \nJACK \nThey put it in my pocket! \nLOVEJOY \n(holding Jack's coat) \nIt's not even your pocket, son. \n(reading) \n\"Property of A. L. Ryerson\". \nLovejoy shows the coat to the Master at Arms. There is a label inside the collar with the owner's name. \nMASTER AT ARMS \nThat was reported stolen today. \nJACK \nI was going to return it! Rose-- \nRose feels utterly betrayed, hurt and confused. She shrinks away from him. He starts shouting to her as Lovejoy and the Master at Arms drag him out into the hall. She can't look him in the eye. \nJACK \nRose, don't listen to them... I didn't do this! You know I didn't! You know it! \nShe is devastated. Her mother lays a comforting hand on her shoulder as te tears well up. \nRUTH \nWhy do women believe men? \nCUT TO: \n162 INT. MAIL SORTING ROOM / HOLD \nSmith and Andrews come down the steps to the Mail Sorting Room and finds the clerks scrambling to pull mail from the racks. They are furiously hauling wet sacks of mail up from the hold below. \nAndrews climbs partway down the stairs to the hold, which is almost full. Sacks of mail float everywhere. The lights are still on below the surface, casting an eerie glow. The Renault is visible under the water, the brass glinting cheerfully. Andrews looks down as the water covers his shoe, and scrambles back up the stairs. \nCUT TO: \n163 INT. BRIDE / CHARTROOM \nAndrews unrolls a big drawing of the ship across the chartroom table. It is a side elevation, showing all the watertight bulkheads. His hands are shaking. Murdoch and Ismay hover behind Andrews and the Captain. \nISMAY \nWhen can we get underway, do you think? \nSmith glares at him and turns his attention to Andrews' drawing. The builder points to it for emphasis as he talks. \nANDREWS \nWater 14 feet above the keel in ten minutes... in the forepeak... in all three holds... and in boiler room six. \nSMITH \nThat's right. \nANDREWS \nFive compartments. She can stay afloat with the first four compartments breached. But not five. Not five. As she goes down by the head the water will spill over the tops of the bulkheads... at E Deck... from one to the next... back and back. There's no stopping it. \nSMITH \nThe pumps-- \nANDREWS \nThe pumps buy you time... but minutes only. From this moment, no matter what we do, Titanic will founder. \nISMAY \nBut this ship can't sink! \nANDREWS \nShe is made of iron, sir. I assure you, she can. And she will. It is a mathematical certainty. \nSmith looks like he has been gutpunched. \nSMITH \nHow much time? \nANDREWS \nAn hour, two at most. \nIsmay reels as his dream turns into his worst nightmare. \nSMITH \nAnd how many aboard, Mr. Murdoch? \nMURDOCH \nTwo thousand two hundred souls aboard, sir. \nA long beat. Smith turns to his employer. \nSMITH \nI believe you may get your headlines, Mr. Ismay. \nCUT TO: \n164 EXT. BOAT DECK \nAndrews is striding along the boat deck, as seamen and officers scurry to uncover the boats. Steam is venting from pipes on the funnes overhead, and the din is horrendous. Speech is difficult adding to the crew's level of disorganization. Andrews sees some men fumbling with the mechanism of one of the Wellin davits and yells to them over the roar of steam. \nANDREWS \nTurn to the right! Pull the falls taut before you unchock. Have you never had a boat drill? \nSEAMAN \nNo sir! Not with these new davits, sir. \nHe looks around, disguisted as the crew fumble with the davits, and the tackle for the \"falls\"... the ropes which are used to lower the boats. A few passengers are coming out on deck, hesitantly in the noise and bitter cold. \nCUT TO: \n165 INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE \nFrom inside the sitting room they can hear knocking and voices in the corridor. \nRUTH \nI had better go dress. \nRuth exits and Hockley crosses to Rose. He regards her coldly for a moment, then SLAPS her across the face. \nCAL \nIt is a little slut, isn't it? \nTo Rose the blow is inconsequential compared to the blow her heart has been given. Cal grabs her shoulders roughly. \nCAL \nLook at me, you little-- \nThere is a loud knock on the door and an urgent voice. The door opens and their steward puts his head in. \nSTEWARD BARNES \nSir, I've been told to ask you to please put on your lifebelt, and come up to the boat deck. \nCAL \nGet out. We're busy. \nThe steward persists, coming in to get the lifebelts down from the top of a dresser. \nSTEWARD \nI'm sorry about the inconvenience, Mr. Hockley, but it's Captain's orders. Please dress warmly, it's quite cold tonight. \n(he hands a lifebelt to Rose) \nMy God. \nCUT TO: \n172 EXT. BOAT DECK - NIGHT \nLightoller has his boats swung out. He is standing amidst a crowd of uncertain passengers in all states of dress and undress. One first class woman is barefoot. Others are in stockings. The maitre of the restaurant is in top hat and overcoat. Others are still in evening dress, while some are in bathrobes and kimonos. Women are wearing lifebelts over velvet gowns, then topping it with sble stoles. Some brought jewels, others books, even small dogs. \nLightoller sees Smith walking stiffly toward him and quickly goes to him. He yells into the Captain's ear, through cupped hands, over the roar of the steam... \nLIGHTOLLER \nHadn't we better get the women and children into the boats, sir? \nSmith just nods, a bit abstractly. The fire has gone out of him. Lightoller sees the awesome truth in Smith's face. \nLIGHTOLLER \n(to the men) \nRight! Start the loading. Women and children! \nThe appalling din of escaping steam abruptly cuts off, leaving a sudden unearthly silence in which Lightoller's voice echoes. \nON WALLACE HARTLEY raising his violin to play. \nHARTLEY \nNumber 26. Ready and-- \nThe band has reassembled just outside the First Class Entrance, port side, near where Lightoller is calling for the boats to be loaded. They strike up a waltz, lively and elegant. The music wafts all over the ship. \nLIGHTOLLER \nLadies, please. Step into the boat. \nFinally one soman steps across the gap, into the boat, terrified of the drop to the water far below. \nWOMAN IN CROWD \nYou watch. They'll put us off in these silly little boats to freeze, and we'll all be back on board by breakfast. \nCal, Rose and Ruth come out of the doors near the band. \nRUTH \nMy brooch, I left my brooch. I must have it! \nShe turns back to go to her room but Cal takes her by the arm, refusing to let her go. The firmness of his hold surprises her. \nCAL \nStay here, Ruth. \nRuth sees his expression, and knows fear for the first time. \nCUT TO: \n173 INT. STEERAGE BERTHING AFT / CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL \nIt is chaos, with stewards pushing their way through narrow corridors clogged with peopel carrying suitcases, duffel bags, children. Some have lifebelts on, others don't. \nSTEWARD #2 \n(to Steward #3) \nI told the stupid sods no luggage. Aw, bloody hell! \nHe throws up his hand at the sight of a family, loaded down with cases and bags, completely blocking the corridor. \nFabrizio and Tommy push past the stewards, going the other way. They rech a huge crowd gathered at the bottom of the MAIN 3RD CLASS STAIRWELL. Fabrizio spots Helga with the rest of the Dahl family, standing patiently with suitcases in hand. He reaches her and she grins, hugging him. \nTommy pushes to where he can see what's holding up the group. There is a steel gate across the top of the stairs, with several stewards and seamen on the other side. \nSTEWARD \nStay calm, please. It's not time to go up to the boats yet. \nNear Tommy, an IRISHWOMAN stands stoically with two small children and their battered luggage. \nLITTLE BOY \nWhat are we doing, mummy? \nWOMAN \nWe're just waiting, dear. When they fiish putting First Class people in the boats, they'll be startin' with us, and we'll want to be all ready, won't we? \nCUT TO: \n174 EXT. STARBOARD SIDE \nBoat 7 is less than half full, with 28 aboard a boat made for 65. \nFIRST OFFICER MURDOCH \nLower away! By the left and right together, stady lads! \nThe boat lurches as the falls start to pay out through the pulley blocks. The women gasp. The boat descends, swaying and jerking, toward the water 60 feet below. The passengers are terrified. \nCUT TO: \n175 EXT. / INT. TITANIC HULL AND MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE \nTRACKING along the rows of portholes angling down into the water. Under the surface, they glow green. PUSHING IN on one porthole which is have submerged. Inside we see Jack, looking apprehensively at the water rising up the glass. \nINSIDE THE MASTER AT ARMS' OFFICE Jack sits chained to the waterpipe, next to the porthole. Lovejoy sits on the edge of a desk. He puts a .45 bullet on the desk and watches it roll across and fall off. He picks up the bullet. \nLOVEJOY \nYou know... I believe this ship may sink. \n(crosses to Jack) \nI've been asked to give you this small token of our appreciation... \nHe punches Jack hard in the stomach, knocking the wind out of him. \nLOVEJOY \nCompliments of Mr. Caledon Hockley. \nLovejoy flips the handcuff key in the air, catches it and puts it in his pocket. He exits. Jack is left gasping, handcuffed to the pipe. \nCUT TO: \n176 EXT. BOAT DECK / STARBOARD SIDE, FORWARD \nAt the stairwell rail on the bridge wing, Fourth Officer Boxhall and Quartermaster Rowe light the first distress rocket. It shoots into the sky and EXPLODES with a thunderclap over the ship, sending out white starbursts which light up the entire deck as they fall. \nWHIP PAN off the starbursts to Ismay. The Managing Director of White Star Line is cracking. Already at the breaking point from his immense guilt, the rocket panics him. He starts shouting at the officers struggling with the falls of BOAT 5. \nISMAY \nThere is no time to waste! \n(yelling and waving his arms) \nLower away! Lower away! Lower away! \nFIFTH OFFICER LOWE, a baby-faced 28, and the youngest officer, looks up from the tangled falls at the madman. \nLOWE \nGet out of the way, you fool! \nISMAY \nDo you know who I am? \nLowe, not having a clue nor caring, squares up to Ismay. \nLOWE \nYou're a passenger. And I'm a ship's bloody officer. Now do what you're told! \n(MORE) \nLOWE (CONT'D) \n(turning away) \nSteady men! Stand by the falls! \nISMAY \n(numbly, backing away) \nYes, quite right. Sorry. \nCUT TO: \n177 EXT. BOAT DECK / PORT SIDE \nSECOND OFFICER LIGHTOLLER is loading the boat nearest Cal and Rose... Boat \nLIGHTOLLER \nWomen and children only! Sorry sir, no men yet. \nAnother rocket bursts overhead, lighting the crowd. Startled faces turn upward. Fear now in the eyes. \nDANIEL MARVIN has his Biograph camera set up, cranking away... hoping to get an exposure off the rocket's light. he has Mary posed in front of the scene at the boats. \nMARVIN \nThe operator fumbles to close the gate and start the lift. \nCUT TO: \n184 EXT. OCEAN / BOAT 6 \nMolly and the two seamen are rowing, and they've made it a hundret feet or so. Enough to see that the ship is angled down into the water, with the bow rail less than ten feet above the surface. \nMOLLY \nCome on girls, join in, it'll keep ya warm. Let's go Ruth. Grab an oar! \nRuth just stares at the spectacle of the great liner, its rows of lights blazing, slanting down into the sullen black mirror of the Atlanic. \nCUT TO: \n185 INT. FIRST CLASS ELEVATOR / CORRIDORS \nThrough the wrought iron door of the elevator car Rose can see the decks going past. The lift slows. Suddenly ICE WATER is swirling around her legs. She SCREAMS in surprise. So does the operator. \nThe car has landed in a foot of freezing water, shocking the hell out of her. She claws the door open and splashes out, hiking up her floor-length skirt so she can move. The lift goes back up, behind her, as she looks around. \nROSE \nLeft, crew passage. \nShe spots it and slogs down the flooded corridor. The place is understandably deserted. She is on her own. \nROSE \nRight, right... right. \nShe turns into a cross-corridor, splashing down the hall. A row of doors on each side. \nROSE \nJack? Jaaacckk?? \nCUT TO: \n186 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE / CORRIDOR \nJack is hopelessly pulling on the pipe again, straining until he turns red. He collapses back on the bench. realizing he's screwed. Then he hears her through the door. \nJACK \nROSE!! In here! \n187 IN THE HALL Rose hears his voice behind her. She spins and runs back, locating the right door, then pushes it open, creating a small wave. \nShe splashes over Jack and puts her arms around him. \nROSE \nJack, Jack, Jack... I'm sorry, I'm so sorry. \nThey are so happy to see each other it's embarrassing. \nJACK \nThat guy Lovejoy put it in my pocket. \nROSE \nI know, I know. \nJACK \nSee if you can find a key for these. Try those drawers. It's a little brass one. \nShe kisses his face and hugs him again, then starts to go through the desk. \nJACK \nSo... how did you find out I didn't do it? \nROSE \nI didn't. \n(she looks at him) \nI just realized I already knew. \nThey share a look, then she goes back to ransacking the room, searching drawers and cupboards. Jack sees movement out the porthole and looks out. \nA LIFEBOAT hits the surface of the water, seen from below. \nCUT TO: \n188 EXT. TITANIC / BOAT ONE \nWhile the seamen detach the falls, Boat One rocks next to the hull. Lucile and Sir Cosmo Duff-Gordon sit with ten others in a boat made for four times that many. \nLUCILE \nI despise small boats. I just know I'm going to be seasick. I always get seasick in small boats. Good Heavens, there's a man down there. \nIn a lit porthole beneath the surface she sees Jack looking up at her... a face in a bubble of light under the water. \nCUT TO: \n189 INT. MASTER AT ARMS OFFICE \nRose stops trashing the room, and stands there, breathing hard. \nROSE \nThere's no key in here. \nThey look around at the water, now almost two feet deep. Jack has pulled his feet up onto the bench. \nJACK \nYou have to go for help. \nROSE \n(nodding) \nI'll be right back. \nJACK \nI'll wait here. \nShe runs out, looking back at him once from the doorway, then splashes away. Jack looks down at the swirling water. \nCUT TO: \n190 INT. STAIRWELL AND CORRIDORS \nRose splashes down the hall to a stairwell going up to the next deck. She climbs the stairs, her long skirt leaving a trail like a giant snail. The weight of it is really slowing her down. She rips at the buttons and shimmies quickly out of the thing. She bounds up the stairs in her stockings and knee-length slip, to find herself in-- \n191 A LONG CORRIDOR... part of the labyrinth of steerage hallways forward. She is alone here. A long groan of stressing metal echoes along the hall as the ship continues to settle. She runs down the hall, unimpeded now. \nROSE \nHello? Somebody?! \nShe turns a corner and runs along another corridor in a daze. The hall slopes down into water which, shimmers, reflecting the light. The margin of the water creeps toward her. A YOUNG MAN appears, running through the water, sending up geysers of spray. He pelts past her without slowing, his eyes crazed... \nROSE \nHelp me! We need help! \nHe doesn't look back. It is like a bad dream. The hull gongs with terrifying sounds. \nThe lights flicker and go out, leaving utter darkness. A beat. Then they come back on. She finds herself hyperventilating. That one moment of blackness was the most terrifying of her life. \nA STEWARD runs around the nearest corner, his arms full of lifebelts. He is upset to see someone still in his section. He grabs her forcefully by the arm, pulling her with him like a wayward child. \nSTEWARD \nCome on, then, let's get you topside, miss, that's right. \nROSE \nWait. Wait! I need your help! There's-- \nSTEWARD \nNo need for panic, miss. Come along! \nROSE \nNo, let me go! You're going the wrong way! \nHe's not listening. And he won't let her go. \nShe SHOUTS in his ear, and when he turns, she punches him squarely in the nose. Shocked, he lets her go and staggers back. \nSTEWARD \nTo Hell with you! \nROSE \nSee you there, buster! \nThe steward runs off, holding his bloody nose. She spits after him. Just the way Jack taugh: her. \nShe turns around, SEES: a glass case with a fire-axe in it. She breaks the glass with a battered suitcase which is lying discarded nearby, and seizes the axe, running back the way she came. \n192 AT THE STAIRWELL she looks down and gasps. The water has flooded the bottom five steps. She goes down and has to crouch to look along the corridor to the room where Jack is trapped. \nyou go, I go. Don't argue with me, Isador, you know it does no good. \nHe looks at her with sadness and great love. They embrace gently. \nLIGHTOLLER \nLower away!! \nCUT TO: \n198 EXT. BRIDGE / FORWARD WELL DECK / FOC'SLE \nAT THE BOW... the place where Jack and Rose first kissed... the bow railing goes under water water. Water swirls around the captsans and windlasses on the foc'sle deck. \nSmith strides to the bridge rail and looks down at the well deck. Water is shipped over the sides and the well deck is awash. Two men run across the deck, their feet sending up spray. Behind Smith, Boxhall fires another rocket. WHOOSH! \nCUT TO: \n199 OMITTED \n200 OMITTED \n201 INT. E-DECK CORRIDORS AND STAIRWELL \nFabrizio, standing with Helga Dahl and her family, hears Jack's voice. \nJACK \nFabrizio! Fabri! \nFabrizio turns and sees Jack and Rose pushing through the crowd. He and Jack hug like brothers. \nFABRIZIO \nThe boats are all going. \nJACK \nWe gotta get up there or we're gonna be gargling saltwater. Where's Tommy? \nFabrizio points over the heads of the solidly packed crowd to the stairwell. \nTommy has his hands on the bars of the steel gate which blocks the head of the stairwell. The crew open the gate a foot or so and a few women are squeezing through. \nSTEWARD #2 \nWomen only. No men. No men!! \nBut some terrified men, not understanding English, try to rush through the gap, forcing the gate open. The crewmen and stewards push them back, shoving and punching them. \nSTEWARD #2 \nGet back! Get back you lot! \n(to the crewmen) \nLock it!! \nThey struggle to get the gate closed again, while Steward #2 brandishes a small revolver. Another holds a fire axe. They lock the gate, and a cry goes up among the crowd, who surge forward, pounding against the steel and shouting in several languages. \nTOMMY \nFor the love of God, man, there are children down here! Let us up, so we can have a chance! \nBut the crewmen are scared now. They have let the situation get out of hand, and now they have a mob. Tommy gives up and pushes his way back through the crowd, going down the stairs. He rejoins Jack, Rose and Fabrizio. \nTOMMY \nIt's hopeless that way. \nJACK \nWell, whatever we're goin' to do, we better do it fast. \nFabrizio turns to Helga, praying he can make himself understood. \nFABRIZIO \n(with a lot of hand gestures) \nEveryone... all of you... come with me now. We go to the boats. We go to the boats. Capito? Come now! \nThey can't understand what he's saying. They can see his urgency, but OLUF DAHL, the patriarch of the family, shakes his head. He will not panic, and will not let his family go with this boy. Fabrizio turns to Helga. \nFABRIZIO \nHelga... per favore... please... come with me, I am lucky. Is my destiny to go to America. \nShe kisses him, then steps back to be with her family. Jack lays a hand on his shoulder, his eyes saying \"Let's go\". \nFABRIZIO \nI will never forget you. \nHe turns to Jack, who leads the way out of the crowd. Looking back Fabrizio sees her face disappear into the crowd. \nCUT TO: \n202 OMITTED \n203 OMITTED \n204 INT. CAL AND ROSE'S SUITE \nCLUNK! Cal opens his safe and reaches inside. As Lovejoy watches, he pulls out two stacks of bills, still banded by bank wrappers. Then he takes out \"Heart of the Ocean\", putting it in the pocket of his overcoat, and locks the safe. \nCAL \n(holding up stacks of bills) \nI make my own luck. \nLOVEJOY \n(putting the .45 in his waistband) \nSo do I. \nCal grins, putting the money in his pocket as they go out. \nCUT TO: \n205 INT. STEERAGE, AFT \nJack, Rose, Fabrizio and Tommy are lost, searching for a way out. They push past confused passengers... past a mother changing her baby's diaper on top of an upturned steamer trunk... past a woman arguing heatedly with a man in Serbo-Croatian, a wailing child next to them... past a man kneeling to console a woman who is just sitting on the floor, sobbing... and past another man with an English/Arabic dictionary, trying to figure out what the signs mean, while his wife and children wait patiently. \nJack et al come upon a narrow stairwell and they go up two decks before they are stopped by a small group pressed up against a steel gate. The steerage men are yelling at a scared STEWARD. \nSTEWARD \nGo to the main stairwell, with everyone else. It'll all get sorted out there. \nJack takes one look at this scene and finally just loses it. \nJACK \nGod damn it to Hell son of a bitch!! \nHe grabs one end of a bench bolted to the floor on the landing. He starts pulling on it, and Tommy and Fabrizio pitch in until the bolts shear and it breaks free. Rose figures out what they are doing and clears a path up the stairs between the waiting people. \nROSE \nMove aside! Quickly, move aside! \nJack and Tommy run up the steps with the bench and RAM IT INTO THE GATE with all their strength. It rips loose from its track and falls outward, narrowly mssing the steward. Led by Jack, the crowd surges though. Rose steps up to the cowering steward and says in her most imperious tone: \nROSE \nIf you have any intention of keeping your pathetic job \n(MORE) \nROSE (CONT'D) \nwith the White Star Line, I suggest you escort these good people to the boat deck... now. \nClass wins out. He nods dumbly motions form them to follow. \nCUT TO: \n206 EXT. BOAT 6 / TITANIC - NIGHT \nRuth rows with Molly Brown, two other women and the incompetent sailors. She rests on her oars, exhausted, and looks back at the ship. \nIt slants down into the water, still ablaze with light. Nothing is above water forward of the bridge except for the foremast. Another rocket goes off, lighting up the entire area... there are a dozen boats moving outward from the ship. \n207 AT THE BOAT DECK RAIL Captain Smith is shouting to Boat 6 through a large metal megaphone. \nSMITH \nCome back! Come back to the ship! \nCHIEF OFFICER WILDE joins him, blowing his silver whistle. \n208 FROM BOAT 6 the whistle comes shrilly across the water. Quartermaster Hitchins grips the rudder in fear. \nHITCHINS \nThe suction will pull us right down if we don't keep going. \nMOLLY \nWe got room for lots more. I say we go back. \nHITCHINS \nCAL \nGod damn it to hell! Come on. \nHe and Lovejoy head for the port side, taking a short-cut through the bridge. \nBruce Ismay, seeing his oppurtunity, steps quickly into Collapsible C. He stares straight ahead, not meeting Murdoch's eyes. \nMURDOCH \n(staring at Ismay) \nTake them down. \nCUT TO: \n221 EXT. BOAT DECK / PORT SIDE - NIGHT \nON THE PORT SIDE Lightoller is getting people into Boat 2. He keeps his pistol in his hand at this point. Twenty feet below them the sea is pouring into the doors and windows of B deck staterooms. They can hear the roar of water cascading into the ship. \nLIGHTOLLER \nWomen and children, please. Women and children only. Step back, sir. \nEven with Jack's arms wrapped around her, Rose is shivering in the cold. Near her a WOMAN with TWO YOUNG DAUGHTERS looks into the eyes of a HUSBAND she knows she may not see again \nHUSBAND \nGoodbye for a little while... only for a little while. \n(to his two little girls) \nGo with mummy. \nThe woman stumbles to the boat with the children, hiding her tears from them. Beneath the false good cheer, the man is choked with emotion. \nHUSBAND \nHold mummy's hand and be a good girl. That's right. \nSome of the women are stoic, others are overwhelmed by emotion and have to be helped into the boats. A MAN scribbles a note and hands it to a woman who is about to board. \nMAN \nPlease get this to my wife in DeMoines, Iowa. \nJack looks at Tommy and Fabrizio. \nJACK \nYou better check out the other side. \nThey nod and run off, searching for a way around the deckhouse. \nROSE \nI'm not going without you. \nJACK \nGet in the boat, Rose. \nCal walks up just then. \nCAL \nYes. Get in the boat, Rose. \nShe is shocked to see him. She steps instinctively to Jack. Cal looks at her, standing there shivering in her wet slip and stockings, a shocking display in 1912. \nCAL \nMy God, look at you. \n(taking off his boat) \nHere, put this on. \nShe numbly shrugs into it. He is doing it for modesty, not the cold. \nLIGHTOLLER \nQuickly, ladies. Step into the boat. Hurry, please! \nJACK \nGo on. I'll get the next one. \nROSE \nNo. Not without you! \nShe doesn't even care that Cal is standing right there. He sees the emotion between Jack and Rose and his jaw clenches. But then he leans close to her and says... \nCAL \n(low) \nThere are boats on the other side that are allowing men in. Jack and I can get off safely. Both of us. \nJACK \n(he smiles reassuringly) \nI'll be alright. Hurry up so we can get going... we got our own boat to catch. \nCAL \nGet in... hurry up, it's almost full. \nLightoller grabs her arm and pulls her toward the boat. She reaches out for Jack and her fingers brush his for a moment. Then she finds herself stepping down into the boat. It's all a rush and blur. \nLIGHTOLLER \nLower away! \nThe two men watch at the rail as the boat begins to descend. \nCAL \n(low) \nYou're a good liar. \nJACK \nAlmost as good as you. \nCAL \nI always win, Jack. One way or another. \n(looks at him, smiling) \nPity I didn't keep that drawing. It's going to be worth a lot more by morning. \nJack knows he is screwed. He looks down at Rose, not wanting to waste a second of his last view of her. \n222 ROSE'S PERCEPTION... IN SLOW MOTION: The ropes going through the pulleys as the seamen start to lower. All sound going away... Lightoller giving orders, his lips moving... but Rose hears only the blood pounding in her ears... this cannot be happening... a rocket bursts above in slow-motion, outlining Jack in a halo of light... Rose's hair blowing in slow motion as she gazes up at him, descending away from him... she sees his hand trembling, the tears at the corners of his eyes, and cannot believe the unbearable pain she is feeling... \nRose is still staring up, tears pouring down her face. \nSUDDENLY SHE IS MOVING. She lunges across the women next to her. Reaches the gunwale, climbing it... \nHurls herself out of the boat to the rail of the A-Deck promenade, catching it, and scrambling over the rail. The Boat 2 continues down. But Rose is back on Titanic. \nJACK \nNo Rose! NOOOO!! \nJack spins from the rail, running for the nearest way down to A-Deck. \nHockley too has seen her jump. She is willing to die for this man, this gutter scum. He is overwhelmed by a rage so all consuming it eclipses all thought. \nCUT TO: \n223 INT. GRAND STAIRCASE \nTRACKING WITH JACK as he bangs through the doors to the foyer and sprints down the stairs. He sees her coming into A-deck foyer, running toward him, Cal's long coat flying out behind her as she runs. \nThey meet at the bottom of the stairs, and collide in an embrace. \nJACK \nRose, Rose, you're so stupid, you're such an idiot-- \nAnd all the while he's kissing her and holding her as tight as he can. \nROSE \nYou jump, I jump, right? \nJACK \nRight. \nHockley comes in and runs to the railing. Looking down he sees them locked in their embrace. Lovejoy comes up behind Cal and puts a restraining HAND on him, but Cal whips around, grabbing the pistol from Lovejoy's waistband in one cobra-fast move. \nHe RUNS along the rail and down the stairs. As he reaches the landing above them he raises the gun. SCREAMING in rage, he FIRES. \nThe carved cherub at the foot of the center railing EXPLODES. Jack pulls Rose toward the stairs going down to the next deck. Cal fires again, running down the steps toward them. A bullet blows a divet out of the oak panelling behind Jack's head as he pulls Rose down the next flight of stairs. \nHockley steps on the skittering head of the cherub statue and goes sprawling. The gun clatters across the marble floor. He gets up, and reeling drunkenly goes over to retrieve it. \nCUT TO: \n233 INT. STAIRWELL \nJack and Rose run up seemingly endless stairs as the ship groans and torgues around them. \nCUT TO: \n234 EXT. BOAT DECK, STARBOARD SIDE \nMurdoch, at Collapsible A, is no longer in control. The crowd is threatening to rush the boat. They push and jostle, yelling and shouting at the officers. The pressure from behind pushes them forward, and one guy falls off the edge of the deck into the water less than ten feet below. \nTOMMY \nGive us a chance to live, you limey bastards! \nMurdoch fires his Webley twice in the air, then point it at the crowd. \nMURDOCH \nI'll shoot any man who tries to get past me. \nCal steps up to him. \nCAL \nWe had a deal, damn you. \nMurdoch pushes him back, pointing the pistol at Cal. \nMURDOCH \nGet back! \nA man next to Tommy rushes forward, and Tommy is shoved from behind. Murdoch SHOOTS the first man, and seeing Tommy coming forward, puts a bullet into his chest. \nTommy collapses, and Fabrizio grabs him, holding him in his arms as his life flows out over the deck. \nMurdoch turns to his men and salutes smartly. Then he puts the pistol to his temple and... BLAM! He drops like a puppet with the strings cut and topples over the edge of the boat deck into the water only a few feet below. \nCal stares in horror at Murdoch's body bobbing in the black water. The MONEY FLOATS out of the pocket of his greatcoat, the bills spreading across the surface. \nThe crew rush to get the last few women aboart the boat. \nPURSER MCELROY \n(calling above the confusion) \nAny more women or children?! \nTHE CHILD crying in the alcove. Cal scoops her up and runs forward, cradling her in his arms. \nCAL \n(forcing his way through the crowd) \nHere's a child! I've got a child! \nCAL (CONT'D) \n(to McElroy) \nPlease... I'm all she has in the world. \nMcElroy nods curtly and pushes him into the boat. He spins with his gun, brandishing it in the air to keep the other men back. Cal gets into the boat, holding the little girl. He takes a seat with the women. \nCAL \nThere, there. \nCUT TO: \n235 INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKE ROOM \nThomas Andrews stands in front of the fireplace, staring at the large painting above the mantle. The fire is still going in the fireplace. \nThe room is empty except for Andrews. An ashtray falls off the table. Behind him Jack and Rose run into the room, out of breath and soaked. They run through, toward the aft revolving door... then Rose recognizes him. She sees that his lifebelt is off, lying on a table. \nROSE \nWon't you even make a try for it, Mr. Andrews? \nANDREWS \n(a tear rolls down his cheek) \nI'm sorry that I didn't build you a stronger ship, young Rose. \nJACK \n(to her) \nIt's going fast... we've got to keep moving. \nAndrews picks up his lifebelt and hands it to her. \nANDREWS \nGood luck to you, Rose. \nROSE \n(hugging him) \nAnd to you, Mr. Andrews. \nJack pulls her away and they run through the revolving door. \nCUT TO: \n236 EXT. BOAT DECK AND VARIOUS LOCATIONS \nThe band finishes the waltz. Wallace Hartley looks at the orchestra members. \nHARTLEY \nRight, that's it then. \nThey leave him, walking forward along the deck. Hartley puts his violin to his chin and bows the first notes of \"Nearer My God to Thee\". One by one the band memebers turn, hearing the lonely melody. \nWithout a word they walk back and take their places. They join in with Hartley, filling out the sound so that it reaches all over the ship on this still night. The vocalist begins: \"If in my dreams I be, nearer my God to thee...\" \nTHE HYMN PLAYS OVER THE FOLLOWING SEQUENCE: \n237 A seaman pulls off his lifebelt and catches up to Captain Smith as he walks to the bridge. He proffers it, but Smith seems to stare through him. Without a word he turns and goes onto the bridge. He enters the enclosed WHEELHOUSE and closes the door. He is alone, surrounded by the gleaming brass instruments. He seems to inwardly collapse. \n238 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Andrews stands like a statue. He pulls out his pocketwatch and checks the time. Then he opens the face of the mantle clock and adjusts it to the correct time: 2:12 a.m. Everything must be correct. \n239 IN CAL'S PARLOUR SUITE water swirls in from the private promenade deck. Rose's paintings are submerged. The Picasso tranforms under the water's surface. Degas' colors run. Monet's water lilies come to life. \n240 DOWNANGLE on the two figures lying side by side, fully clothed, on a bed in a FIRST CLASS CABIN. Elderly Ida and Isador Strauss stare at the ceiling, holding hands like young lovers. Water pours into the room through a doorway. It swirls around the bed, two feet deep rising fast. \n241 IN A STEERAGE CABIN somewhere in the bowels of the ship, the young IRISH MOTHER, seen earlier stoically waiting at the stairs, is tucking her two young children into bed. She pulls up the covers, making sure they are all warm and cozy. She lies down with them on the bed, speaking soothingly and holding them. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BOAT DECK / BRIDGE \n242 IN A WIDE SHOT we see a wave travel up the boat deck as the bridge house sinks into the water. \n243 ON THE PORT SIDE Collapsible B is picked up by water. Working frantically, the men try to detach it from the falls so the ship won't drag it under. Colonel Gracie hands Lightoller a pocket knife and he saws furiously at the ropes as the water swirls around his legs. The boat, still upside down, is swept off the ship. Men start diving in, swimming to stay with it. \n244 IN COLLAPSIBLE A Cal sits next to the wailing child, whom he has completely forgotten. He watches the water rising around the men as they work, scrambling to get the ropes cut so the ship won't drag the collapsible under. \nFabrizio removes the lifebelt from Tommy's body and struggles to put it on as the water rises around him. \n245 CAPTAIN SMITH, standing near the wheel, watches the black water climbing the windows of the enclosed wheelhouse. He has the stricken expression of a damned sould on Judgment Day. The windows burst suddenly and a wall of water edged with shards of glass slams into Smith. He disappears in a vortex of foam. \n246 Collapsible A is hit by a wave as the bow plunges suddenly. It partially swamps the boat, washing it along the deck. Over a hundred passengers are plunged into the freezing water and the area around the boat becomes a frenzy of splashing, screaming people. \nAs men are trying to climb into the callapsible, Cal grabs an oar and pushes them back into the water. \nCAL \nGet back! You'll swamp us! \nFabrizio, swimming for his life, gets swirled under a davit. The ropes and pulleys tangle around him as the davit goes under the water, and he is dragged down. Underwater he struggles to free himself, and then kicks back to the surface. He surfaces, gasping for air in the freezing water. \n247 WALLACE HARTLEY sees the water rolling rapidly up the deck toward them. He holds the last note of the hymn in a sustain, and then lowers his violin. \nHARTLEY \nGentlemen, it has been a previlege playing with you tonight. \nCUT TO: \n248 EXT. A-DECK AFT, PORT SIDE \nJack and Rose run out of the PALM COURT into a dense crowd. Jack pushes his way to the rail and looks at the state of the ship. The bridge is under water and tehre is chaos on deck. Jack helps her put her lifebelt on. People stream around them, shouting and pushing. \nJACK \nOkay... we keep moving aft. We have to stay on the ship as long as possible. \nThey push their way aft through the panicking crowd. \nCUT TO: \n249 EXT. FORWARD FUNNEL \nCollapsible A is whirled like a leaf in the currents around the sining ship. It slams against the side of the forward funnel. \nCAL \n(to the crew in the boat) \nRow! Row you bastards!! \nSwimming in the water directly under the stern a few unfortunates shriek as they see the keel coming down on them like God's bootheel. The massive stern section falls back almost level, thundering down into the sea and pushing out a mighty wave of displaced water. \nJack and Rose struggle to hole onto the stern rail. They feel the ship seemingly RIGHT ITSELF. Some of those praying think it is salvation. \nSEVERAL PEOPLE \nWe're saved! \nJack looks at Rose and shakes his head, grimly. \nNow the horrible mechanics play out. Pulled down by the awesome weight of the flooded bow, the buoyant stern tilts up rapidly. They feel the RUSH OF ASCENT as the fantail angles up again. Everyone is clinging to benches, railings, ventilators... anything to keep from sliding as the stern lifts. \nThe stern goes up and up, past 45 degrees, then past sixty. \nPeople start to fall, sliding and tumbling. They skid down the deck, screaming and flailing to grab onto somehting. They wrench other people loose and pull them down as well. There is a pile-up of bodies at the forward rail. The DAHL FAMILY falls one by one. \nJACK \nWe have to move! \nHe climbs over the stern rail and reaches back for Rose. She is terrified to move. He grabs her hand. \nJACK \nCome on! I've got you! \nJack pulls her over the rail. It is the same place he pulled her over the rail two nights earlier, going the other direction. She gets over just as the railing is going HORIZONTAL, and the deck VERITCAL. Jack grips her fiercely. \nThe stern is now straight up in the air... a rumbling black monolith standing against the stars. It hangs there like that for a long grace note, its buoyancy stable. \nRose lies on the railing, looking down fifteen stories to the boiling sea at the base of the stern section. People near them, who didn't climb over, hang from the railing, their legs dangling over the long drop. They fall one by one, plummeting down the vertical face of the poop deck. Some of them bounce horribly off deck benches and ventilators. \nJack and Rose lie side by side on what was the vertical face of the hull, gripping the railing, which is now horizontal. Just beneath their feet are the gold letters TITANIC emblazoned across the stern. \nRose stares down terrified at the black ocean waiting below to claim them. Jack looks to his left and sees Baker Joughin, crouching on the hull, holding onto the railing. It is a surreal moment. \nJOUGHIN \n(nodding a greeting) \nHelluva night. \nThe final relentless plunge begins as the stern section floods. Looking down a hundred feet to the water, we drop like an elevator with Jack and Rose. \nJACK \n(talking fast) \nTake a deep breath and hold it right before we go into the water. The ship will suck us down. Kick for the surface and keep kicking. Don't let go of my hand. We're gonna make it Rose. Trust me. \nShe stares at the water coming up at them, and grips his hand harder. \nROSE \nI trust you. \nBelow them the poop deck is disappearing. The plunge gathers speed... the boiling surface engulfs the docking bridge and then rushes up the last thirty feet. \n278 IN A HIGH SHOT, we see the stern descend into the boiling sea. The name TITANIC disappears, and the tiny figures of Jack and Rose vanish under the water. \nWhere the ship stood, now there is nothing. Only the black ocean. \nCUT TO: \n279 EXT. OCEAN / UNDERWATER AND SURFACE \nBodies are whirled and spun, some limp as dolls, others struggling spasmodically, as the vortex sucks them down and tumbles them. \n280 Jack rises INTO FRAME F.G. kicking hard for the surface... holding tightly to Rose, pulling her up. \n281 AT THE SURFACE: a roiling chaos of screaming, thrashing people. Over a thousand people are now floating where the ship went down. Some are stunned, gasping for breath. Others are crying, praying, moaning, shouting... screaming. \nJack and Rose surface among them. They barely have time to gasp for air before people are clawing at them. People driven insane by the water, 4 degrees below freezing, a cold so intense it is indistinguishable form death by fire. \nA man pushes Rose under, trying to climb on top of her... senselessly trying to get out of the water, to climb onto anything. Jack PUNCHES him repeatedly, pulling her free. \nJACK \nSwim, Rose! SWIM! \nShe tries, but her strokes are not as effective as his because of her lifejacket. They break out of the clot of people. He has to find some kind of flotation, anything to get her out of the freezing water. \nJACK \nKeep swimming. Keep moving. Come one, you can do it. \nAll about them there is a tremendous wailing, screaming and moaning... a chorus of tormented souls. And beyond that... nothing but black water stretching to the horizon. The sense of isolation and hopelessness is overwhelming. \nCUT TO: \n282 OMITTED \n283 EXT. OCEAN \nJack strokes rhythmically, the effort keeping him from freezing. \nJACK \nLook for something floating. Some debris... wood... anything. \nROSE \nIt's so cold. \nJACK \nI know. I know. Help me, here. Look around. \nHis words keep her focused, taking her mind off the wailing around them. Rose scans the water, panting, barely able to draw a breath. She turns and... SCREAMS. \nA DEVIL is right in from of her face. It is the black FRENCH BULLDOG, swimming right at her like a seamonster in the darkness, its coal eyes bugging. It motors past her, like it is headed for Newfoundland. \nBeyond it Rose sees somehting in the water. \nROSE \nWhat's that? \nJack sees what she is pointing to, and they make for it together. It is a piece of wooden debris, intricately carved. He pushes her up and she slithers onto it belly down. \nBut when Jack tries to get up onto the thing, it tilts and submerges, almost dumping Rose off. It is clearly only big enough to support her. He clings to it, close to her, keeping his upper body out of the water as best he can. \nTheir breath floats around them in a cloud as they pant from exertion. A MAN swims toward them, homing in on the piece of debris. Jack warns him back. \nJACK \nIt's just enough for this lady... you'll push it under. \nMAN \nLet me try at least, or I'll die soon. \nJACK \nYou'll die quicker if you come any closer. \nMAN \nYes, I see. Good luck to you then. \n(swimming off) \nGod bless. \nCUT TO: \n284 EXT. COLLAPSIBLE A / OCEAN \nThe boat is overloaded and half-flooded. Men cling to the sides in the water. Others, swimming, are drawn to it as their only hope. Cal, standing in the boat, slaps his oar in the water as a warning. \nCAL \nStay back! Keep off! \nFabrizio, exhausted and near the limit, makes it almost to the boat. Cal CLUBS HIM with the oar, cutting open his scalp. \nFABRIZIO \nYou don't... understand... I have... to get... to America. \nCAL \n(pointing with the oar) \nIt's that way! \nCLOSE ON FABRIZIO as he floats, panting each breath agony. You see the spirit leave him. \nFABRIZIO'S POV: Cal in SLOW MOTION, yelling and wielding the oar. A demon in a tuxedo. The image fades to black. \nCUT TO: \n285 EXT. OCEAN \nJACK AND ROSE still float amid a chorus of hte damned. Jack sees the ship's officer nearby, CHIEF OFFICER WILDE. He is blowing his whistle furiously, knowing the sound will carry over the water for miles. \nJACK \nThe boats will come back for us, Rose. Hold on just a little longer. They had to row away for the suction and now they'll be coming back. \nShe nods, his words helping her. She is shivering uncontrollably, her lips blue and her teeth chattering. \nROSE \nThank God for you Jack. \n", "test1_input": "SMITH \nYes, like a mill pond. Not a breath of wind. \nLIGHTOLLER \nIt's make the bergs harder to see, with no breaking water at the base. \nSMITH \nMmmmm. Well, I'm off. Maintain speed and heading, Mr. Lightoller. \nLIGHTOLLER \nYes sir. \nSMITH \nAnd wake me, of course, if anything becomes in the slightest degree doubtful. \nCUT TO: \n111 INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE \nRose, fully dressed now, returns to the sitting room. They hear a key in the lock. Rose takes Jack's hand and leads him silently through the bedrooms. Lovejoy enters by the sitting room door. \nLOVEJOY \nMiss Rose? Hello? \nHe hears a door opening and goes through Cal's room toward hers. \nCUT TO: \n112 INT. CORRIDOR OUTSIDE SUITE \nRose and Jack come out of her stateroom, closing the door. She leads him quickly along the corridor toward the B deck foyer. They are halfway across the open space when the sitting room door opens in the corridor and Lovejoy comes out. The valet sees Jack with Rose and hustles after them. \nROSE \nCome on! \nShe and Jack break into a run, surprising the few ladies and gentlemen about. Rose leads him past the stairs to the bank of elevators. They run into one, shocking the hell out of the OPERATOR. \nROSE \nTake us down. Quickly, quickly! \nThe Operator scrambles to comply. Jack even helps him close the steel gate. Lovejoy runs up as the lift starts to descend. He slams one hand on the bars of the gate. Rose makes a very rude and unladylike gesture, and laughs as Lovejoy disappears above. The Operator gapes at her. \nCUT TO: \n113 INT. E-DECK FOYER / ELEVATORS \nLovejoy emerges from another lift and runs to the one Jack and Rose were in. The Operator is just closing the gate to go back up. Lovejoy runs around the bank of elevators and scans the foyer... no Jack and Rose. He tries the stairs going down to F-Deck. \nCUT TO: \n114 INT. F-DECK CORRIDORS / FAN ROOM \nA functional space, with access to a number of machine spaces (fan rooms, boiler uptakes). Jack and Rose are leaning against a wall, laughing. \nJACK \nPretty tough for a valet, this fella. \nROSE \nHe's an ex-Pinkerton. Cal's father hired him to keep Cal out of trouble... to make sure he always got back to the hotel with his wallet and watch, after some crawl through the less reputable parts of town... \nJACK \nKinda like we're doin' right now-- uh oh! \nLovejoy has spotted them from a cross-corridor nearby. He charges toward them. Jack and Rose run around a corner into a blind alley. There is one door, marked CREW ONLY, and Jack flings it open. \n115 They enter a roaring RAN ROOM, with no way out but a ladder going down. Jack latches the deadbolt on the door, and Lovejoy slams against it a moment later. Jack grins at Rose, pointing to the ladder. \nJACK \nAfter you, m'lady. \nCUT TO: \n116 INT. BOILER ROOM FIVE AND SIX \nJack and Rose come down the escape ladder and look around in amazement. It is like a vision of hell itself, with the roaring furnaces and black figures moving in the smoky glow. They run the length of the boiler room, dodging amazed stokers, and trimmers with their wheelbarrows of coal. \nJACK \n(shouting over the din) \nCarry on! Don't mind us! \nThey run through the open watertight door into BOILER ROOM SIX. Jack pulls her through the fiercely hot alley between two boilers and they wind up in the dark, out of sight of the working crew. Watching from the shadows, they see the stokers working in the hellish glow, shovelling coal into the insatiable maws of the furnaces. The whole place thunders with the roar of the fires. \nCUT TO: \n117 INT. FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM \nAmid unparalled luxury, Cal sits at a card game, sipping brandy. \nCOLONEL GRACIE \nWe're going like hell I tel you. I have fifty dollars that says we make it into New York Tuesday night! \nCal looks at his gold pocket watch, and scowls, not listening. \nCUT TO: \n118 OMITTED \n119 INT. BOILER ROOM SIX \nThe furnaces roar, silhouetting the glistening stokers. Jack kisses Rose's face, tasting the sweat trickling down from her forehead. They kiss passionately in the steamy, pounding darkness. \nCUT TO: \n120 INT. HOLD #2 \nJack and Rose enter and run laughing between the rows of stacked cargo. She hugs herself against the cold, after the dripping heat of the boiler room. \nThey come upon William Carter's brand new RENAULT touring car, lashing down to a pallet. It looks like a royal coach from a fairy tale, its brass trim and headlamps nicely set off by its deep burgundy color. \nRose climbs into the plushly upholstered back seat, acting very royal. There are cut crystals bud vases on the walls back there, each containing a rose. Jack jumps into the driver's seat, enjoying hte feel of the leather and wood. \nJACK \nWhere to, Miss? \nROSE \nTo the stars. \nON JACK as her hands come out of the shadows and pull him over the seat into the back. He lands next to her, and his breath seems loud in the quiet darkness. He looks at her and she is smiling. It is the moment of truth. \nJACK \nAre you nervous? \nROSE \nAu contraire, mon cher. \nHe strokes her face, cherishing her. She kisses his artist's fingers. \nROSE \nPut your hands on me Jack. \nHe kisses her, and she slides down in the seat under his welcome weight. \nCUT TO: \n121 INT. WIRELESS ROOM \nA BRILLIANT ARC OF ELECTRICITY fills frame-- the sparks gap of the Marconi instrument as SENIOR WIRELESS OPERATOR JACK PHILLIPS (24) rapidly keys out a message. Junior Operator Bride looks through the huge stack of outgoing messages swamping them. \nBRIDE \nLook at this one, he wants his private train to meet him. La dee da. \n(slaps them down) \nWe'll be up all bloody night on this lot. \nPhillips start to receive an incoming message from a nearby ship, the Leyland frieghter CALIFORNIAN, which jams his outgoing signal. At such close range, the beeps are deafening. \nPHILLIPS \nChrist! It's that idiot on the Californian. \nCursing, Phillips furiously keys a rebuke. \nCUT TO: \n122 INT. / EXT. WIRELESS SHAK / FREIGHTER CALIFORNIAN \nWireless Operater CYRIL EVANS pulls his earphone off his ear as the Titanic's spark deafens him. he translates the message for THIRD OFFICER GROVES. \nEVANS \nStupid bastard. I try to warn him about the ice, and he says \"Keep out. Shut up. I'm working Cape Race.\" \nGROVES \n", "test1_true": "EVANS \n\"No seasickness. Poker business good. Al\". Well that's it for me. I'm shutting down. \nAs Evans wearily switches off his generator, Groves goes out on deck. PAN oFF Him to reveal the ship is stopped fifty yards from the edge of a field of pack ice and icebergs stretching as far as the eye can see. \nCUT TO: \n123 EXT. OCEAN / TITANIC \nON TITANIC, steaming hellbent through the darkness, hurling up white water at the bows. The bow comes straight at us, until the bow wave WIPES THE FRAME-- \nCUT TO: \n124 INT. HOLD #2 \nPUSHING IN on the rear window of the Renault, which is completely fogged up. Rose's hand comes up and slams against the glass for a moment, making a handprint in the veil of condensation. \nINSIDE THE CAR, Jack's overcoat is liek a blanket over them. It stirs and Rose pulls it down. They are huddled under it, intertwined, still mostly clothed. Their faces are flushed and they look at each other wonderingly. She puts her hand on his face, as if making sure he is real. \nROSE \nYou're trembling. \nJACK \nIt's okay. I'm alright. \nHe lays his cheek against her chest. \nJACK \nI can feel your heart beating. \nShe hugs his head to her chest, and just holds on for dear life. \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nWell, I wasn't the first teenage girl to get seduced in the backseat of a car, and certainly not the last, by several million. He had such fine hands, artists' hands, but strong too... roughened by work. I remember their touch even now. \nCUT TO: \n125 EXT. ATLANTIC / TITANIC - NIGHT \nThe bow sweeps under us, and the CAMERA CLIMBS toward the foremast and the tiny half-cylinder of the crow's nest, which grows as we push in on lookouts Fleet and Lee. They are stamping their feet and swinging their arms, trying to keep warm in the 22 knot freezing wind, which whips capor of their breath away behind. \nFLEET \nYou can smell ice, you know, when it's near. \nLEE \nBollocks. \nFLEET \nWell I can. \nCUT TO: \n126 INT. BOILER ROOM SIX \nWithout hearing hte words over the roar of the furnaces, we see stokers telling TWO STEWARDS which way Rose and Jack went. The stewards move off toward the forward holds. \nCUT TO: \n127 INT. CAL AND ROSE'S SUITE \nCal stands at the open safe. He stares at the drawing of Rose and his face clenches with fury. He reads the not again: \"DARLING, NOW YOU CAN KEEP US BOTH LOCKED IN YOUR SAFE, ROSE\". \nLovejoy, standing behind him, looks over his shoulder at the drawing. Cal crumples Rose's not, then takes the drawing in both hands as if to rip it in half. He tenses to do it, then stops himself. \nCAL \nI have a better idea. \nCUT TO: \n128 INT. HOLD #2 - NIGHT \nThe two stewards enter. They have electric torches and play the beams around the hold. They spot the Renault with its fogged up rear window and approach it slowly. \nFROM INSIDE we see the torch light up Rose's passionate handprint, still there on the fogged up glass. One steward whips open the door. \nSTEWARD \nGot yer! \nREVERSE: the back seat is empty. \nCUT TO: \n129 EXT. FORWARD WELL DECK AND CROW'S NEST - NIGHT \nRose and Jack, fully dressed, come through a crew door onto the deck. They can barely stand, they are laughing so hard. \nUP ABOVE THEM, IN THE CROW'S NEST, lookout Fleet hears the disturbance below and looks around and back down to the well deck, where he can see two figures embracing. \nJack and Rose stand in each others arms. Their breath clouds around them in the now freezing air, but they don't even feel the cold. \nROSE \nWhen this ship docks, I'm getting off with you. \nJACK \nThis is crazy. \nROSE \nI know. It doesn't make any sense. That's why I trust it. \nJack pulls her to him and kisses her fiercely. \n130 IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet nudges Lee. \nFLEET \nCor... look at that, would ya. \nLEE \nThey're a bloody sight warmer than we are. \nFLEET \nWell if that's what it takes for us two to get warm, I'd rather not, if it's all the same. \nThey both have a good laugh at that one. It is Fleet whose expression falls first. Glancing forward again, he does a double take. The color drains out of his face. \nFLEET'S POV: a massive iceberg right in their path, 500 yards out. \nFLEET \nBugger me!! \nFleet reaches past Lee and rings the lookout bell three times, then grabs the telephone, calling the bridge. He waits precious seconds for it to be picket up, never taking his eyes off the black mass ahead. \nFLEET \nPick up, ya bastard. \nCUT TO: \n131 INT. / EXT. BRIDGE \nInside the enclosed wheelhous, SIXTH OFFICER MOODY walks unhurriedly to the telephone, picking it up. \nFLEET (V.O.) \nIs someone there? \nMOODY \nYes. What do you see? \nFLEET \nIceberg right ahead! \nMOODY \nThankyou. \n(hangs up, calls to Murdoch) \nIceberg right ahead! \nMurdoch sees it and rushes to the engine room telegraph. While signaling \"FULL SPEED ASTERN\" he yells to Quartermaster Hitchins, who is at the wheel. \nMURDOCH \nHard a' starboard. \nMOODY \n(standing behind Hitchins) \nHard'a starboard. The helm is hard over, sir. \nCRASH SEQUENCE / SERIES OF CUTS: \n132 CHIEF ENGINEER BELL is just checking the soup he has warming on a steam manifold when the engine telegraph clangs, then goes... incredibly... to FULL SPEED ASTERN. He and the other ENGINEERS just stare at it a second, unbelieving. Then Bell reacts. \nBELL \n", "test1_id": 144, "test2_input": "Full astern! FULL ASTERN!! \nThe engineers and greasers like madmen to close steam valves and start braking the mighty propeller shafts, big as Sequias, to a stop. \n133 IN BOILER ROOM SIX, Leading Stoker FREDERICK BARRETT is standing with 2nd Engineer JAMES HESKETH when the red warning light and \"STOP\" indicator come on. \nBARRETT \nShut all dampers! Shut 'em!! \n134 FROM THE BRIDGE Murdoch watches the burg growing... straight ahead. The bow finally starts to come left (since the ship turns the reverse of the helm setting). \nMURDOCH'S jaw clenches as the bow turns with agonizing slowness. He holds his breath as the horrible physics play out. \n135 IN THE CROW'S NEST Frederick Fleet braces himself. \n136 THE BOW OF THE SHIP thunders right at CAMERA and-- \nKRUUUNCH!! The ship hits the berg on its starboard bow. \n137 UNDERWATER we see the ice smashing in the steel hull plates. The iceberg bumps and scrapes along the side of the ship. Rivets pop as the steel plate of the hull flexes under the load. \n138 IN #2 HOLD the two stewards stagger as the hull buckles in four feet with a sound like THUNDER. Like a sledgehammer beating along outside the ship, the berg splits the hull plates and the sea pour in, sweeping them off their feert. The icy water swirls around the Renault as the men scramble for the stairs. \n139 ON G-DECK forward Fabrizio is tossed in his bunk by the impact. He hears a sound like the greatly amplified squeal of a skate on ice. \n140 IN BOILER ROOM SIX Barret and Hesketh stagger as they hear the ROLLING THUNDER of the collision. They see the starboard side of the ship buckle in toward them and are almost swept off their feet by a rush of water coming in about two feet above the floor. \n141 ON THE FORWARD WELL DECK Jack and Rose break their kiss and look up in astonishment as the berg sails past, blocking out the sky like a mountain. Fragments break off it and crash down onto the deck, and they have to jump back to avoid flying chunks of ice. \n142 ON THE BRIDGE Murdoch rings the watertight door alarm. He quicky throws the switch that closes them. \nMURDOCH \nHard a 'port! \nJudging the berg to be amidships, he is trying to clear the stern. \n143 BARRETT AND HESKETH hear the DOOR ALARM and scramble through the swirling water to the watertight door between Boiler Rooms 6 and 5. The room is full of water vapor as the cold sea strikes the red hot furnaces. Barrett yells to the stokers scrambling through the door as it comes down like a slow guillotine. \nBARRETT \nGo Lads! Go! Go! \nHe dives through into Boiler Room 5 just before the door rumbles down with a CLANG. \n144 JACK AND ROSE rush to the starboard rail in time to see the berg moving aft down the side of the ship. \n145 In his stateroom, surrounded by piles of plans while making notes in his ever-present book, Andrews looks up at the sound of a cut-crystal light fixture tinkling like a windchime. \nHe feels the shudder run through the ship. And we see it in his face. Too much of his soul is in this great ship for him not to feel its mortal wound. \n146 IN THE FIRST CLASS SMOKING ROOM Gracie watches his highball vibrating on the table. \n147 IN THE PALM COURT, with its high arched windows, Molly Brown holds up her drink to a passing waiter. \nMOLLY \nHey, can I get some ice here, please? \nSilently, a moving wall of ice fills the window behind her. She doesn't see it. It disappears astern. \n148 OMITTED \n149 IN THE CROW'S NEST Fleet turns to his Lee... \nFLEET \nOy, mate... that was a close shave. \nLEE \nSmell ice, can you? Bleedin' Christ! \nCUT TO: \n150 INT. / EXT. BRIDGE \nCLOSE ON MURDOCH. The alarm bells still clatter mindlessly, seeming to reflect his inner state. He is in shock, unable to get a grip on what just happened. He just ran the biggest ship in history into an iceberg on its maiden voyage. \nMURDOCH \n(stiffly, to Moody) \nNote the time. Enter it in the log. \nCaptain Smith rushes out of his cabin onto the bridge, tucking in his shirt. \nSMITH \nWhat was that, Mr. Murdoch? \nMURDOCH \nAn iceberg, sir. I put her hard a' starboard and run the engines full astern, but it was too close. I tried to port around it, but she hi... and I-- \nSMITH \nClose the emergency doors. \nMURDOCH \nThe doors are closed. \nTogether they rush out onto the starboard wing, and Murdoch points. Smith looks into the darkness aft, then wheels around to FOURTH OFFICER BOHALL. \nSMITH \nFind the Carpenter and get him to sound the ship. \nCUT TO: \n151 INT. G-DECK FORWARD \nIn steerage, Fabrizio comes out into the hall to see what's going on. He sees dozens of rats running toward him in the corridor, fleeing the flooding bow. Fabrizio jumps aside as the rats run by. \nFABRIZIO \nMa-- che cazzo! \n152 IN HIS STATEROOM Tommy gets out of his top bunk in the dark and drops down to the floor. SPLASH!! \nTOMMMY \nCor!! What in hell--?! \nHe naps on the light. The floor is covered with 3 inches of freezing water, and more coming in. He pulls the door open, and steps out into the corridor, which is flooded. Fabrizio is running toward him, yelling something in Italian. Tommy and Fabrizio start pounding on doors, getting everybody up and out. The alarm spreads in several languages. \nCUT TO: \n153 INT. FIRST CLASS CORRIDOR / A-DECK \nA couple of people have come out into the corridor in robes and slippers. A STeWARD hurries along, reassuring them. \nWOMAN \nWhy have the engines stopped? I felt a shudder? \nSTEWARD #1 \nI shouldn't worry, m'am. We've likely thrown a propeller blade, that's the shudder you felt. May I bring you anything? \nTHOMAS ANDREWS brushes past them, walking fast and carrying an armload of rolled up ship's plans. \nCUT TO: \n154 EXT. FORWARD WELL DECK \nJack and Rose are leaning over the starboard rail, looking at the hull of the ship. \nJACK \nLooks okay. I don't see anything. \nROSE \nCould it have damaged the ship? \nJACK \nIt didn't seem like much of a bump. I'm sure we're okay. \nBehind them a couple of steerage guys are kicking the ice around the deck, laughing. \nCUT TO: \n155 INT. STEERAGE FORWARD \nFabrizio and Tommy are in a crowd of steerage men clogging the corridors, heading aft away from the flooding. Many of them have grabbed suitcases and duffel bags, some of which are soaked. \nTOMMY \nIf this is the direction the rats were runnin', it's good enough for me. \nCUT TO: \n156 INT. CORRIDOR ON B DECK \nBruce Ismay, dressed in pajamas under the topcoat, hurries down the corridor, headed for the bridge. An officious steward named BARNES comes along the other direction, getting the few concerned passengers back into their rooms. \nSTEWARD BARNES \nThere's no cause for alarm. Please, go back to your rooms. \nHe is stopped in his tracks by Cal and Lovejoy. \n", "test2_true": "Please, sir. There's no emergency-- \nCAL \nYes there is, I have been robbed. Now get the Master at Arms. Now you moron! \nCUT TO: \n157 INT. BRIDGE / CHARTROOM \nC.U. CAPTAIN SMITH studying the commutator. \nHe turns to Andrews, standing behind him. \nSMITH \nA five degree list in less than ten minutes. \nSHIP'S CARPENTER JOHN HUTCHINSON enters behind him, out of breath and clearly unnerved. \nHUTCHINSON \nShe's making water fast... in the forepeak tank and the forward holds, in boiler room six. \nISMAY enters, his movements quick with anger and frustration. Smith glances at him with annoyance. \nISMAY \nWhy have we stopped? \nSMITH \nWe've struck ice. \nISMAY \nWell, do you think the ship is seriously damaged? \nSMITH \n(glaring) \nExcuse me. \nSmith pushes past him, with Andrews and Hutchinson in tow. \nCUT TO: \n158 INT. BOILER ROOM 6 \nStrokers and firemen are struggling to draw the fires. They are working in waist deep water churning around as it flows into the boiler room, ice cold and swirling with grease from the machinery. Chief Engineer Bell comes partway down the ladder and shouts. \nBELL \nThat's it, lads. Get the hell up! \nThey scramble up the escape ladders. \nCUT TO: \n159 EXT. B-DECK FORWARD / WELL DECK \nThe gentlemen, now joined by another man, leans on the forward rail watching the steerage men playing soccer with chunks of ice. \nGENTLEMAN \nI guess it's nothing too serious. I'm going back to my cabin to read. \nA 20ish YALE MAN pops through the door wearing a topcoat over pajamas. \nYALEY \nSay, did I miss the fun? \nRose and Jack come up the steps from the well deck, which are right next to the three men. They stare as the couple climbs over the locked gate. \nA moment later Captain Smith rounds the corner, followed by Andrews and Carpenter Hutchinson. They have come down from the bridge by the outside stairs. The three men, their faces grim, crush right past Jack and Rose. Andrews barely glances at her. \nSMITH \nCan you shore up? \nHUTCHINSON \nNot unless the pumps get ahead. \nThe inspection party goes down the stairs to the well deck. \nJACK \n(low, to her) \nIt's bad. \nROSE \nWe have to tell Mother and Cal. \nJACK \nNow it's worse. \nROSE \nCome with me, Jack. I jump, you jump... Right? \nJACK \nRight. \nJack follows Rose through the door inside the ship. \nCUT TO: \n160 INT. B-DECK FOYER / CORRIDOR \nJack and Rose cross the foyer, entering the corridor. Lovejoy is waiting for them in the hall as they approach the room. \nLOVEJOY \nWe've been looking for you miss. \nLovejoy follows and, unseen, moves close behind Jack and smoothly slips the diamond necklace into the pocket of his overcoat. \nCUT TO: \n161 INT. ROSE AND CAL'S SUITE \nCal and Ruth wait in the sitting room, along with the Master at Arms and two stewards (Steward #1 and Barnes). Silence as Rose and Jack enter. Ruth closes her robe at her throat when she sees Jack. \nROSE \nSomething serious has happened. \nCAL \nThat's right. Two things dear to me have disappeared this evening. Now that one is back... \n(he looks from Rose to Jack) \n... I have a pretty good idea where to fine the other. \n(to Master at Arms) \nSearch him. \nThe Master at Arms steps up to Jack. \nMASTER AT ARMS \nCoat off, mate. \nLovejoy pulls at Jack's coat and Jack shakes his head in dismay, shrugging out of it. The Master at Arms pats him down. \nJACK \nThis is horseshit. \nROSE \nCal, you can't be serious! We're in the middle of an emergency and you-- \nSteward Barnes pulls the Heart of the Ocean out of the pocket of Jack's coat. \nSTEWARD BARNES \nIs this it? \nRose is stunned. Needless to say, so is Jack. \nCAL \nThat's it. \nMASTER AT ARMS \nRight then. Now don't make a fuss. \nHe starts to handcuff Jack. \nJACK \nDon't you believe it, Rose. Don't! \nROSE \n", "test2_id": 145, "test3_input": "(barely audible) \nJack. \nShe touches his shoulder with her free hand. He doesn't respond. Rose gently turns his face toward her. It is rimed with frost. \nHe seems to be sleeping peacefully. \nBut he is not asleep. \nRose can only stare at his still face as the realization goes through her. \nROSE \nOh, Jack. \nAll hope, will and spirit leave her. She looks at the boat. It is further away now, the voices fainter. Rose watches them go. \nShe closes her eyes. She is so weak, and there just seems to be no reason to even try. \nAnd then... her eyes snap open. \nShe raises her head suddenly, cracking the ice as she rips her hair off the wood. She calls out, but her voice is so weak they don't hear her. The boat is invisible now, the torch light a star impossibly far away. She struggles to draw breath, calling again. \n292 IN THE BOAT Lowe hears nothing behind him. He points to something ahead, turning the tiller. \n293 ROSE struggles to move. Her hand, she realizes, is actually frozen to Jack's. She breaths on it, melting the ice a little, and gently unclasps their hands, breaking away a thin tinkling film. \nROSE \nI won't let go. I promise. \nShe releases him and he sinks into the black water. He seems to fade out like a spirit returning to some immaterial plane. \nRose rolls off the floating staircase and plunges into the icy water. She swims to Chief Officer Wilde's body and grabs his whistle. She starts to BLOW THE WHISTLE with all the strength in her body. Its sound slaps across the still water. \n294 IN BOAT 14 Lowe whips around at the sound of the whistle. \nLOWE \n(turning the tiller) \nRow back! That way! Pull! \nRose keeps blowing as the boat comes to her. She is still blowing when Lowe takes the whistle from her mouth as they haul her into the boat. She slips into uncosciousness and they scramble to cover her with blankets... \nDISSOLVE TO: \n295 INT. IMAGING SHACK / KELDYSH \nEXTREME CLOSEUP of Rose's ancient, wrinkled face. Present day. \nOLD ROSE \nFifteen hundred people went into the sea when Titanic sank from under us. There were twenty boats floating nearby and only one came back. One. Six were saved from the water, myself included. Six out of fifteen hundred. \nAs she speaks THE CAMERA TRACKS slowly across the faces of Lizzy and the salvage crew on KELDYSH. Lovett, Bodine, Buell, the others... the reality of what happened here 84 years before has hit them like never before. With her story Rose has put them on Titanic in its final hours, and or the first time, they do feel like graverobbers. \nLovett, for the first time, has even forgotten to ask about the diamond. \nOLD ROSE \nAfterward, the seven hundred people in the boats had nothing to do but waith... wait to die, wait to live, wait for an absolution which would never come. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n296 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - PRE-DAWN \nMATCHING MOVE as the camera tracks along the faces of the saved. \nDISSOLVE TO: ANOTHER BOAT, and then ANOTHER, seeing faces we know among the survivors: Ismay in a trance, just staring and trembling... Cal, sipping from a hip flask offered to him by a black-faced stoker... Ruth hugging herself, rocking gently. \nIN BOAT 14: CLOSE ON ROSE, lying swaddled. Only her face is visile, white as the moon. The man next to her jumps up, pointing and yelling. Soon everyone is looking and shouting excitedly. In Rose's POV it is all silent, SLOW MOTION. \nIN SLOW-MOTION SILENCE we see Lowe light a green flare and wave it as everyone shouts and cheers. Rose doesn't react. She floats beyond all human emotion. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n298 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OPEN SEA - DAWN \nGolden lgiht washes across the white boats, which gloat in a calm sea reflecting the rosy sky. All around them, like a flotilla of sailing ships, are icebergs. The CARPATHIA sits nearby, as boats row toward her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \n299 EXT. LIFEBOATS / OCEAN / CARPATHIA MONTAGE - DAY \nIMAGES DISSOLVE into one another: a ship's hull looming, with the letters CARPATHIA visible on the bow... Rose watching, rocked by the sea, her face blank... seamen helping survivors up the rope ladder to the Carpathia's gangway doors... two women crying and hugging each other inside the ship... ALL SILENT, ALL IN SLOW-MOTION. There is just music, so gentle and sad, part elegy, part hymn, part aching song of love lost forever. \nTHE IMAGES CONTINUE to music... Rose, outside of time, outside of herself, coming into Carpathia, barely able to stand... Rose being draped wtih warm blankets and given hot tea... BRUCE ISMAY climbing aboard. He has the face and eyes of a damned soul. \nAs Ismay walks along the hall, guided by a crewman toward the doctor's cabin, he passes rows of seated and standing widows. He must run the gauntlet of their accusing gazes. \nCUT TO: \n300 EXT. DECK / CARPATHIA - DAY \nIt is the afternoon of the 15th. Cal is searching the faces of the widows lining the deck, looking for Rose. The deck of Carpathia is crammed with huddled people, and even the recovered lifeboats of Titanic. On a hatch cover sits an enormous pile of lifebelts. \nHe keeps walking toward the stern. Seeing Cal's tuxedo, a steward approaches him. \nCARPATHIA STEWARD \nYou won't find any of your people back here, sir. It's all steerage. \nCal ignores him and goes amongst this wrecked group, looking under shawls and blankets at one bleak face after another. \nRose is sipping hot tea. Her eyes focus on him as he approaches her. He barely recognizes her. She looks like a refugee, her matted hair hanging in her eyes. \nROSE \nYes, I lived. How awkward for you. \nCAL \nRose... your mother and I have been looking for you-- \nShe holds up her hand, stopping him. \nROSE \nPlease don't. Don't talk. Just listen. We will make a deal, since that is something you understand. From this moment you do not exist for me, nor I for you. You shall not see me again. And you will not attempt to find me. In return I will keep my silence. Your actions last night need never come to light, and you will get to keep the honor you have carefully purchased. \nShe fixes him with a glare as cold and hard as the ice which changed their lives. \nROSE \nIs this in any way unclear? \nCAL \n(after a long beat) \nWhat do I tell your mother? \nROSE \nTell her that her daughter died with the Titanic. \nShe stands, turning to the rail. Dismissing him. We see Cal stricken with emotion. \nCAL \nYou're precious to me, Rose. \nROSE \nJewels are precious. Goodbye, Mr. Hockley. \nWe see that in his way, the only way he knows, he does truly love her. \nAfter a moment, he turns and walks away. \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nThat was the last time I ever saw him. He married, of course, and inherited his millions. The crash of 28 hit his interests hard, and he put a pistol in his mouth that year. His children fought over the scraps of his estate like hyenas, or so I read. \n301 ANGLE ON ROSE, at the railing of the Carpathia, 9pm April 18th. She gazes up at the Statue of Liberty, looking just as it does today, welcoming her home with her glowing torch. It is just as Fabrizio saw it, so clearly, in his mind. \n302 LATER CARPATHIA DISCORGES THE SURVIVORS at the Cunard pier, Pier 54. Over 30,000 people line the dock and fill the surrounding streets. The magnesium flashes of the photographers go off like small bombs, lighting an amazing tableau. \nSeveral hundred police keep the mob back. The dock is packes with friends and reletives, officials, ambulances, and the press-- \nReporters and photographers swarm everywhere... 6 deep at the foot of the gangways, lining the tops of cars and trucks... it is the 1912 equicalent of a media circus. They jostle to get close to the survivors, tugging on them as they pass and shouting over each other to ask them questions. \nRose is covered with a whoollen shawl and walking with a group of steerage passengers. Immigration officers are asking them questions as they come off the gangway. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER \nName? \nROSE \nDawson. Rose Dawson. \nThe officer steers her toward a holding area for processing. Rose walks forward with the dazed immigrants. The BOOM! of photographer's magnesium flashes cause them to flinch, and the glare is blinding. There is a sudden disturbance near her as two men burst through the cordon, running to embrace an older woman along the survivors, who cries out with joy. The reporters converge on this emotional scene, and flashes explode. \nRose uses this moment to slip away into the crowd. She pushes through the jostling people, moving with purpose, and none challenges her in the confusion. \nOLD ROSE (V.O.) \nCan you exchange one life for another? A caterpillar turns into a butterfly. If a mindless insect can do it, why couldn't I? Was it any more unimaginable than the sinking of the Titanic? \nTRACKING WITH HER as she walks away, further and further until she flashes and the roar are far behind her, and shi is till walking, determined. \nCUT TO: \n", "test3_true": "Old Rose sits with the group in the Imaging Shack, lit by the blue glow of the screens. She holds the haircomb with the jade butterfly on the handle in her gnarled hands. \nBODINE \nWe never found anything on Jack. There's no record of him at all. \nOLD ROSE \nNo, there wouldn't be, would there? And I've never spoken of him until now, not to anyone. \n(to Lizzy) \nNot even your grandfather. A woman's heart is a deep ocean of secrets. But now you all know there was a man named Jack Dawson, and that he saved me, in every way that a person can be saved. \n(closing her eyes) \nI don't even have a picture of him. He exists now only in my memory. \nCUT TO: \n304 OMITTED \n305 EXT. OCEAN FLOOR / TITANIC WRECK \nThe Mir submersibles make their last pass over the ship. We hear Yuri the pilot on the UQC: \nYURI \nMir One returning to surface. \nThe sub rises off the deck of the wreck, taking its light with it, leaving the Titanic once again it its fine and private darkness. \nCUT TO: \n306 EXT. KELDYSH DECK \nA desultory wrap party for the expedition is in progress. There is music and some of the (co-ed) Russian crew are dancing. Bodine is getting drunk in the aggressive style of Baker Joughin. \nLovett stands at the rail, looking down into the black water. Lizzy comes to him, offering him a beer. She puts her hand on his arm. \nLIZZY \nI'm sorry. \nLOVETT \nWe were pissin' in the wind the whole time. \nLovett notices a figure move through the lights far down at the stern of the ship. \nLOVETT \nOh shit. \nCUT TO: \n307 EXT. KELDYSH STERN DECK \nRose walks through the shadows of the deck machinery. Her nightgown blows in the wind. Her feet are bare. Her hands are clutched at her chest, almost as if she is praying. \nON LOVETT AND LIZZY running down the stairs from the top deck, hauling ass. \nROSE reaches the sern rail. Her gnarled fingers wrap over the rail. Her ancient foot steps up on the gunwale. She pushes herself up, leaning forward. Over her shoulder, we see the black water glinting far below. \nLOVETT AND LIZZY run up behind her. \nLIZZY \nGrandma, wait!! Don't-- \nROSE TURNS her head, looking at them. She turns further, and we see she has something in her hand, something she was about to drop overboard. \nIt is the \"Heart of the Ocean\". \nLovett sees his holy grail in her hand and his eyes go wide. Rose keeps it over the railing where she can drop it anytime. \nROSE \nDon't come any closer. \nLOVETT \nYou had it the entire time?! \nFLASH CUT TO: A SILENT IMAGE OF YOUNG ROSE walking away from Pier 54. The photographers' flashes go off like a battle behind her. She has her hands in her pockets. She stops, feeling something, and pulls out the necklace. She stares at it in amazement. \nBACK ON KELDYSH, Rose smiles at Brock's incomprehension. \nROSE \nThe hardest part about being so poor, was being so rich. But every time I though of selling it, I though of Cal. And somehow I always got by without his help. \nShe holds it out over the water. Bodine and a couple of the other guys come up behind Lovett, reacting to what is in Rose's hand. \nBODINE \nHoly shit. \nLOVETT \nDon't drop it Rose. \nBODINE \n(a fierce whisper) \nRush her. \nLOVETT \n(to Bodine) \nIt's hers, you schmuck. \n(to her) \nLook, Rose, I... I don't know what to say to a woman who tries to jump off the Titanic when it's not sinking, and jumps back onto it when it is... we're not dealing with logic here, I know that... but please... think about this a second. \nROSE \nI have. I came all the way here so this could go back where it belongs. \nThe massive diamond glitters. Brock edges closer and holds out his hand... \nLOVETT \nJust let me hold it in my hand, Rose. Please. Just once. \nHe comes closer to her. It is reminiscent of Jack slowly moving up to her at the stern of Titanic. \nSurprisingly, she calmly places the massice stone in the palm of his hand, while still holding onto the necklace. Lovett gazes at the object of his quest. An infinity of cold scalpels glint in its blue depths. It is mesmerizing. It fits in his hand just like he imagined. \nLOVETT \nMy God. \nHis grip tightens on the diamond. \nHe looks up, meeting her gaze. Her eyes are suddenly infinitely wise and deep. \nROSE \nYou look for treasures in the wrong place, Mr. Lovett. Only life is priceless, and making each day count. \nHis fingers relax. He opens them slowly. Gently she slips the diamond out of his hand. He feels it sliding away. \nThen, with an impish little grin, Rose tosses the necklace over the rail. Lovett gives a strangled cry and rushes to the rail in time to see it hit the water and disappear forever. \nBODINE \nAww!! That really sucks, lady! \nBrock Lovett goes through ten changes before he settles on a reaction... HE LAUGHS. He laughs until the tears come to his eyes. Then he turns to Lizzy. \nLOVETT \nWould you like to dance? \nLizzy grins at him and nods. Rose smiles. She looks up at the stars. \n308 IN THE BLACK HEART OF THE OCEAN, the diamond sinks, twinkling end over end, into the infinate depths. \nCUT TO: \n309 INT. ROSE'S CABIN / KELDYSH \nA GRACEFUL PAN across Rose's shelf of carefully arranged pictures: \nRose as a young actress in California, radiant... a theatrically lit studio publicity shot... Rose and her husband, with their two children... Rose with her son at his college graduation... Rose with her children and grandchildren at her 70th birthday. A collage of images of a life lived well. \nTHE PAN STOPS on an image filling frame. Rose, circa 1920. She is at the beach, sitting on a horse at the surfline. The Santa Monica pier, with its rollercoaster is behind her. She is grinning, full of life. \nWe PAN OFF the last picture to Rose herself, warm in her bunk. A profile shot. She is very still. She could be sleeping, or maybe something else. \nCUT TO: \nBLACKNESS \n310 THE WRECK OF TITANIC looms like a ghost out of the dark. It is lit by a kind of moonlight, a light of the mind. We pass over the endless forecastle deck to the superstructure, moving faster than subs can move... almost like we are flying. \nWE GO INSIDE, and the echoing sound of distant waltz music is heard. The rust fades away from the walls of the dark corridor and it is transformed... WE EMERGE onto the grand staircase, lit by glowing chandelier. The music is vibrant now, and the room is populated by men in tie and tails, women in gowns. It is exquisitely beautiful. \nIN POV we sweep down the staircase. The crowd of beautiful gentlmen and ladies turn as we descend toward them. At the bottom a man stands with his back to us... he turns and it is Jack. Smiling he holds his hand out toward us. \nIN A SIDE ANGLE Rose goes into his arms, a girl of 17. The passengers, officers and crew of the RMS Titanic smile and applaud in the utter silence of the abyss. \n", "test3_id": 146}

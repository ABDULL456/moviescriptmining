MELISSA I mean, I did it too. And I only took nine or ten hits. Vernon didn't tell you any of this, did he? 
EDDIE No. 
Melissa snorts as if to say, typical. 
MELISSA Well, when he told me about this amazing new drug... (MORE) 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (2) MELISSA (CONT'D) I was like, down the hatch. And it was amazing. I read Brian Greene's The Elegant Universe in 45 minutes and understood it. My work rate increased... just, insanely, overnight. My boss started to hate me -- they offered me his job. And then I got scared. 
EDDIE Why? 
MELISSA I'm not stupid. I mean, nobody can keep up that level of mental activity and not crash. I stopped taking it. 
EDDIE And...? 
MELISSA I got sick. Headaches, throwing up... I went back to Vernon to see if I maybe shouldn't take another hit, or half a hit, and then he told me about... about the people who were dying. One guy didn't die, but he's a vegetable, his mother has to sponge him down every day... (BEAT) How much have you been taking, Eddie? 
A long beat as they look into each other's eyes. 
EDDIE A lot. 
MELISSA Well, maybe they've worked out the bugs. Maybe... maybe this isn't the same batch... 
Eddie hates the look in her eyes. His hands are at his temples. 
MELISSA (CONT'D) You're off it right now, aren't you? 
EDDIE Yeah. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: (3) 
MELISSA Are you getting a headache? 
EDDIE Finish your story. 
MELISSA Well, I didn't take more. And I didn't die. But after a while I found I couldn't concentrate on anything for longer than ten minutes. I missed deadlines. I got lazy... and slow... put on weight... the magazine let me go. My husband checked out. Sex? Get out of here. 
She leans back, looks him in the eyes. 
MELISSA (CONT'D) That was two years ago, and I haven't been the same since. I can't read any more -- I mean, the fucking New York Post? 
Eddie feels ill, physically ill, hearing this. 
MELISSA (CONT'D) After this, I'm going to have a migraine for three days. And I've got to pee. Which is another thing. 
She gets up... goes to the Ladies room. And now Eddie sees -- she wears a LEG BRACE. Like a kid, from the old days, with Polio. 
EDDIE (V.0.) How many times had I thought of her, my first real love... 
We see FLASHES OF YOUNG MELISSA... 
EDDIE (V.0.) (CONT'D) But that Melissa had unraveled in time and space -- she was a ghost now. I was never going to see her again, never bump into her in the street... 
The tears gather behind Eddie's eyes. He can't help it. He puts his hand to his face to hide his emotions. 
EXT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY 
Eddie leaves with Melissa. He is controlling his tears -- barely. 
MELISSA You have some left? Good. Go home and take it. Take the dose down, but don't just stop -- you'll die if you just stop. Try to taper off. Otherwise, the headache's just the beginning... I have to go-- 
Eddie, indeed, is rubbing his temples. 
EDDIE But when I run out-- 
MELISSA I don't know. I have to go-- 
Eddie catches her arm. 
EDDIE Who invented MDT? 
MELISSA I don't know-- (BEAT) Goodbye, Eddie. 
He lets go of her arm. A puffy, crippled woman about to cry. She turns her back and moves away from him, stiffly, limping, without looking back. 
EXT. EDDIE'S POV - HIS APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY 
EDDIE (V.O.) No one seemed to be watching my apartment, maybe I could chance it. 
ON EDDIE 
He glances around - the coast is clear - and sets off across the street. He looks weak, ill - his breathing labored. He stumbles - catches himself 
EDDIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I was getting sicker by the moment. Luckily I had one pill on me... 
He pulls it from his pocket.

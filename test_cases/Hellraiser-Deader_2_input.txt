Amy puts the phone back on the table. 
AMY Who are you? Why did you do this to me? 
PINHEAD I didn't. Believe me, when I want to hurt you, it will be more than a scratch. 
AMY Then why the hell are you here? Why are you in my room? 
PINHEAD This isn't your room. It's mine... 
AMY What... 
PINHEAD This is my room, my building, my street... my world. You still can't believe that you're in the "real" world, can you? I mean... you've just had a A knife run through you. Shouldn't it hurt? 
AMY It's a dream. I'm dreaming... 
PINHEAD No. Dreams come to an end. Nightmares are forever. 
He approaches her. She backs away. 
PINHEAD You've been recruited as a soldier in another man's war. A war he will never win, that I can assure you. 
AMY I don't know what you're talking about. 
PINHEAD You will. Soon enough. But one shouldn't worship false Gods. Especially when that false God is themselves. 
AMY I'm not a believer. 
PINHEAD Oh you will. Tell me, do you believe in Hell? 
Looks down at the blade jutting out from her chest. 
AMY Starting to. 
PINHEAD You opened a door. He pulled you in. But the only way out -- is through me. 
He steps towards her. 
She grabs up the phone, flings it. It hits the far wall and falls to the floor. Winter's gone. She reaches a hand behind her, to her back, brings it back, red with blood. 
A MOMENT LATER 
We see Amy rolling a towel up into a tight cylinder. Hands trembling, she lays it across a wide strip of duct tape that she's unwound from a roll and laid down on the table, sticky side up. 
She presses the towel down so that it sticks, then picks up the tape, with towel attached. She slides the towel down the center of her back until it covers the wound, and then tugs the tape tight across her chest, compressing the towel against the wound. 
She takes the tape and awkwardly loops it around the towel and herself a couple more times, finally biting through the tape and tossing the roll away. She yanks yesterday's clothes up, discards the skirt in favor of a pair of black jeans. 
She tugs them up over her bloody legs, pulls a black shirt on over her top, thrusts her bloody feet into a pair of heavy shoes and finally tugs on a black leather jacket. 
She goes to the mirror, turns, trying to see how her profile looks with the towel stuffed in her back. 
She turns, about to leave... then realizes that her hands are red with her own blood. She hurries to the sink, rinses them off, and rinses the blood off of her face and neck, then grabs her bag and heads out the door. 
EXT. AMY'S HOTEL - NIGHT 
Amy comes unsteadily down out of her Hotel. 
EXT. DARK STREET - NIGHT

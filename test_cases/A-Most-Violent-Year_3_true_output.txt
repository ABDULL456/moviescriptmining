JULIAN No. 
LOUIS SERVIDIO Alright, there's a door down here about four more flights. Don't go out there, that's the street. Go down about two more flights after that and you'll come out below the bridge. They won't be there. 
JULIAN Fuck you! 
LOUIS SERVIDIO You're welcome. 
Then LOUIS SERVIDIO's head disappears and we can hear his feet flying down the steps again. 
JULIAN thinks for a beat, then he starts off down the stairs again as well. The camera stays right where it was as JULIAN heads down out of sight. We just hear the sounds of his feet getting lower and lower. 
INT. BRIDGE GROUND FLOOR - DAY 
JULIAN comes to the first door and looks at it. We can hear sirens in the distance on the other side of the door. He keeps going. 
Down two more flights, just as he said, there is another doorway. JULIAN walks up to that door very carefully. He listens on the other side but doesn't hear anything but his own breath. 
INT. STAIR LANDING LOWEST LEVEL - DAY 
Then we hear the door back up top fly open. JULIAN then quietly opens the door in front of him and right in front of his face is a woman in full jogging clothes running by him. He looks around, and after a second to get himself orientated, we see he's on a riverfront esplanade where there are many people jogging and walking, enjoying the evening. 
JULIAN looks at his hand and realizes he is still holding the gun out in the open. He puts it away and then looks up at the bridge that is hovering above him. 
He knows he left his life as he knew it up on that bridge. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
Over the black we begin to hear the rumble of a very large truck. It gets louder and louder. 
INT. OF A VERY LARGE EMPTY DUMPSTER - DAY 
We now see that SALES STUDENT ALEX is inside a massive, empty construction dumpster. And as he looks around, we realize it is on the back of a truck that is currently driving pretty fast. With each bump that the truck goes over the noise inside the dumpster is deafening. As the KID comes to his senses he tries to stand up. As he does, we see that the sides of the dumpster are at least eight feet tall and the interior is very slick without anything to grab or stand on. He is trapped. 
Just then the truck goes over another huge bump and comes to a stop. It idles for a minute then begins backing up. It stops. A warning, beeping alarm is heard, and finally one end of the dumpster begins rising. As it gets higher and higher our KID tries to hold himself back, but he begins to slide towards the low end. As he does he sees that the end that he is heading towards is on a hinge and it is starting to swing open. Finally the thing is at such an angle that he can't hold on any longer and he slides towards the opening. 
As he falls out he/we see that he's being dumped over the edge of a cliff of some sort. He falls probably 10-12 feet, into a pile of garbage. As he gathers himself and tries to stand, we see he is standing in a massive landfill. He looks around as the truck pulls away. He's left totally alone. 
INT. TENNIS COURT OF SUBURBAN MANSION - DAY 
ABEL is led by a MAID into an indoor tennis court. The house is massive and designed like an English Country Estate. 
As ABEL walks up we see PETER FORENTE on the court playing against an automatic tennis ball machine. He is in full tennis whites as he hammers the balls back at the machine. 
ABEL approaches the court and watches for a beat. 
PETER FORENTE It's a pretty cool machine, isn't it? 
ABEL nods. 
PETER FORENTE (CONT'D) I was paying a guy five bucks an hour to do this with me last year. ABEL Peter. 
This causes PETER to look up and see the serious look on ABEL's face. He hits one last shot and walks a little closer to ABEL. The machine is still hitting balls behind PETER. 
PETER FORENTE Yes. 
ABEL I need to speak with you. 
PETER FORENTE I see that. PETER walks over to the machine and unplugs it. He points over towards the chairs courtside. He and ABEL sit down. 
ABEL This has gotten out of control... There was a guy with a gun at my house. 
ABEL lets this sit for a minute, and he is intently reading PETER's face. He hopes not, but he is judging to see if PETER had anything to do with all these attacks. PETER just looks back at him with a very strong poker face. 
ABEL (CONT'D) My wife and children were home at the time. 
PETER FORENTE Is everyone okay? 
ABEL Yes. I managed to chase him off. 
PETER FORENTE Well, I'm sorry, that must have been scary... what can I do. 
ABEL I need to know who is doing this. PETER FORENTE Abel... 
ABEL It's one thing to come after my trucks and drivers... and to steal from me... but this... it's different. 
PETER FORENTE Yes. 
ABEL Have you ever dealt with anything like this? 
PETER FORENTE Have you met my father?

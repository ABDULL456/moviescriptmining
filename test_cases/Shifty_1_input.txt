1   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING 
A large empty coach, all dull beige seats and wood veneer, makes its way along a stretch of motorway. 
2   INT. COACH / MOTORWAY. MORNING 
At the back of the coach we see a lone passenger. His eyes closed, head drooped. Suddenly he raises a hand and rubs the bridge of his nose. It's no use, Chris, 25, can't sleep. He pulls up a set of head phones, puts them on, and presses play on his MP3. 
3   INT. COACH. MORNING 
Long shot from the front of the coach, the driver's gruff face to the left, empty seats filtering away from camera, Chris' head peaking above a back seat. We hear the music from his MP3 begin to play. It's Noel McKoy's "Brighter Day", a northern soul track that's reminiscent of Motown and comparable to the vocal sound of Marvin Gaye. 
The track will play over the following opening scenes, the credits fading subtly in and out in white text. 
4   EXT. STREET. MORNING 
We follow from behind as a hooded character walks with intent through Dudlowe: a sprawling new town built in the fifties to house the east end after the Second World War. 
CUT TO: 
We reveal Shifty, 25, Pakistani, as he makes his way through those morning streets. He blows on his hands to warm them up. 
SHIFTY 
Suddenly he ducks down and nips through an opening in a fence, making a short cut. 
5   INT. TREVOR HOUSE / BATHROOM. MORNING 
Bird's eye view on Trevor Perry, average looking, thickset, pallid skin, lying beneath the surface of the bath water, holding his nose. 
SIDE ANGLE ON BATH: TREVOR RISES, NOT GASPING FOR AIR, JUST CALM, UNNATURAL ALMOST. SNOT RUNS FROM HIS NOSTRILS. 
6    INT. COACH. MORNING. 
Chris stares out of the window. The music still playing on his MP3. The coach makes a sharp left turn, the camera just catching a glimpse of the sign: DUDLOWE NEW TOWN. 
7    INT. GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING 
Glen, a severe almost cruel face, empty's about a kilo of cocaine onto a clean glass table. 
8    INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING 
Jasmine, 25, pretty with out make up, dressed in a white dressing gown, prepares breakfast. 
9    EXT. DUDLOWE STREET. MORNING 
Shifty makes his way across a patch of waste land, jumping over a fence at the end. 
10   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / KITCHEN. MORNING 
Suddenly Jasmine lurches toward the sink and vomits. 
11   INT. TREVOR'S HOUSE / BEDROOM. EARLY MORNING 
In an agreeably decorated bedroom Trevor dresses for work. He climbs into his thick checked shirt and jeans, no real enthusiasm - life seems to hold no motivation. 
12   INT. COACH. MORNING 
Chris watches out the window as the coach passes the same strip of waste land Shifty just walked across. 
13   GLEN'S COUNCIL FLAT. MORNING 
Glen splits the cocaine into two piles.

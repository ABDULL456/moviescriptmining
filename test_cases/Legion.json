{"test1_input": "LEGION \nWritten by \nPeter Schink & Scott Stewart \n10.31.07 Final Draft \nTITLE OVER BLACK \n\"Come, ye children, listen to me.   I will teach you the fear of the LORD.\" \nPSALM 34:11 \nTHE MOJAVE DESERT - DUSK Vast.    Barren.   No signs of life. A BLOOD RED SUN is sinking behind the distant mountains.    The unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold. A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined. \nWOMAN'S VOICE When I was a little girl, my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to God, for he was kind, merciful and just. Things changed after my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the Mojave Desert. She never talked about a kind and merciful God again. Instead she spoke of a prophecy. Of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of Mankind would be decided. One night I finally got up the courage to ask my mother why God had changed, why was he mad at his children. \"I don't know,\" she said, tucking the covers around me, \"I guess he just got tired of all the bullshit.\" And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED OUT, leaving us in: \nDARKNESS... A darkness filled with the sounds of SIRENS, GLASS SHATTERING, SPORADIC GUNFIRE...a CITY FALLING INTO CHAOS. TITLE:   \"Los Angeles, December 23rd - 1:02 a.m.\" \nA BLOOD RED MOON reflected in a greasy puddle of water. Might just be the smog that's making it that ominous color. Then we notice something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing, coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM! \nTWO BLACK BOOTS land hard in the water...and we're in: \nEXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT \nA DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head, deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a fight. His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL. He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from? A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems to motivate him. Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner, SIRENS WAILING, heading this way. He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip past. Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly. Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor sharp. Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light. As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over, and then... \n...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO \nWHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS. The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens. The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast. \nA HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE... \n...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT... \n...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE... \nCLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING, \nSWIRLING WITH THE RAIN... \nEXT. CITY STREET - A SHORT WHILE LATER \nMichael, face tight with pain, trench coat back on, steps out of the alley, stares with determination at a dark storefront across the street. \n\"GUN & SPORT WORLD\" \nINT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - A SHORT WHILE LATER \nCavernous. A Costco for survivalists.    Quiet except for the sound of RAIN, then... SMASH! Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a shower of glass. \n", "test1_true": "Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink. His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the fluorescent light, we get a better look at him. His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is a living book. But the writing is in no language we recognize. He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades. \nFRESH. BLOODY. He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE, and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the cement floor around his feet. \nINT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER \nTrench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons, his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life for this. Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags. Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big. Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold. The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get out of here? \nINT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME \nTwo COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun. The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.      Busy night. Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the streetwalkers. \nBURTON Goddamn' animals. Nights like this I wish I could take a match to this city just so I could watch all these motherfuckers burn. \nESTEVEZ \n(LAUGHS) A good ol' boy barbecue, huh? Burton doesn't even smile.       He's dead fucking serious. \nBURTON A fresh start. That's what this place needs. He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people they pass, picking them off one by one. \nBURTON Pow!   Pow!     Pow! Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh.      Estevez eyes his partner, wary. \nESTEVEZ Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so happy we get to share beautiful moments like this. They really brighten my da-- KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car. Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time to see... \nEXT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - CONTINUOUS \nMichael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly out of the GAPING HOLE he's blown in the front of the store. \nESTEVEZ (O.S.) Freeze! Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car, crouching behind the open doors, GUNS trained on Michael. \nESTEVEZ Drop the bags! Hands on your head! In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE. \"Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!\" The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused. \nMICHAEL (sensing their unease:) It's starting. There isn't much time. The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- \"what the hell?\" -- then they turn back to Michael. \nBURTON Shut the fuck up and drop the bags now! Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground. \nESTEVEZ Hands on your head!    On your head! Michael slowly places his palms on his skull. \nBURTON Turn around! Turn the fuck around! Michael slowly turns around.    Calm. Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist, FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible decision made. And that's when he moves, a fucking blur! In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off with Burton. Burton struggles to find a shot, can't. \nBURTON Let `em go! \nESTEVEZ Take the shot, Burton! \nBURTON I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g-- Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his throat like a skipping record. \nESTEVEZ Burton!? THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the confusion. Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him. And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH \nBEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE \n", "test1_id": 1263, "test2_input": "The Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display. He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures huddled around them. He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively covering his face. Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms. \nKYLE I got you! Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening. The creatures have stopped coming at him. In fact, they're just standing there watching him.   Waiting. Kyle freezes.   CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly wrong. \nYOUNG BOY (O.S.) Mister... Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms.   GHOSTLY WHITE EYES stare back at him. \nYOUNG BOY \n(WHISPERS) Fooled ya. \nA FLASH OF TEETH AS KYLE'S THROAT IS TORN OUT. Kyle drops to his knees. Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls. \nAUDREY Kyle! \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nBob kicks over a table in disgust. \nBOB Damn it all to hell! \nCHARLIE Oh, no.   Audrey... Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and run towards Kyle. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nThe young boy stands over Kyle, silently watching the life drain from his body. The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears suddenly appear in his eyes. He opens his arms pleadingly to her. \nYOUNG BOY I'm sorry!     I didn't mean to! \nAUDREY Fuck you! Audrey raises the 45 and ...     CLICK.   CLICK.   CLICK. She keeps pulling the trigger.    Nothing. The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an eerie calm for someone so young. \nYOUNG BOY You're gonna die now. The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body. Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the diner. Blocked by advancing creatures. They're everywhere.    She's trapped. She notices the open door to the MINIVAN.     And so she BOLTS. Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK! She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows. A nightmare come to life. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nPanic. Charlie rushes to Michael's side. \nCHARLIE Do you have no heart?!     She's just a kid! But he's immovable. \nCHARLIE You can't let her die! (grabbing a gun from the \nTABLE) I swear if you don't do something, I will! Charlie COCKS the gun, moves toward the door. \nMICHAEL Wait. \nCharlie looks back at him, defiant.   No one breathes.   Then: \nMICHAEL (raising his guns) Open the door. Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed Charlie and out into hell. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nWith stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps. IN THE MINIVAN, Audrey screams as the windows begin to CRACK. She's running out of time. Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at the minivan. What's he up to? The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if they've just now noticed him. And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait, there's more to this trick. Up comes Michael's Glock in his other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The spray of gas EXPLODES into a SPRAY OF FIRE! The MINIVAN is engulfed in flames. Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through the night. The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of glass. Michael drops the gas pump. He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and unlocks the door. Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED \n", "test2_true": "MICHAEL Come with me. Meanwhile, fire is spreading quickly under the car... Michael pulls Audrey from the flaming vehicle. \nMICHAEL Run. \nAnd together they run toward the open diner door. \nBEHIND THEM THE MINIVAN EXPLODES.   A BALL OF FIRE ROARS AT \nTHEM! \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nEveryone's eyes go wide at the insanity they're witnessing. Audrey is the first one in. Michael is almost there.   But the fire is faster, ENGULFING \nHIM IN FLAME! \nCHARLIE Michael! \nBOB (pulling Charlie away from the door) Get back! BURSTING OUT OF THE FLAMES, Michael marches confidently into the diner. Jeep slams the door CLOSED just as the WALL OF \nFIRE REACHES THEM. Everyone hits the deck as the FIRE SHOOTS THROUGH THE SLATS covering the windows like spindly fingers reaching for prey. Michael's clothes are a smoky, smoldering mess.   Jeep and Bob rush to pat him down. Audrey's coughing from the smoke. \nCHARLIE I'll get some water! Charlie dashes behind the counter to the sink.    She fills up a pitcher of water. She turns away from the sink with the filled pitcher... And SCREAMS! The YOUNG BOY with the lifeless white eyes stands before her wielding an ENORMOUS BUTCHER'S KNIFE. The pitcher shatters LOUDLY on the floor. The boy swings the knife at her, slicing open the waitress outfit covering her pregnant belly. Charlie tumbles back to the ground behind the counter. She frantically pushes herself away from the approaching boy. \nBut she doesn't have far to go before she'll run out of room to maneuver. \nYOUNG BOY C'mon, don't be scared. I just wanna play with your baby. That's it.    She's backed against the end of the counter! The boy raises the knife to strike. Charlie grabs a baking pan off a shelf. Swings it out in front of her body like a shield, as the KNIFE IS DRIVEN DOWN. CLANG! The knife hits the pan hard and stops. But the boy's hands don't. They slip off the handle and run right down the blade. The knife CLATTERS to the ground. The boy instinctively raises his hands to strike again, but there's no knife. Charlie watches in horror as the boy calmly realizes that his THUMBS ARE MISSING. Blood sprays from the stumps. Charlie pulls her legs in close then rockets them out at the boy's chest. He's catapulted away from her. Michael leaps over the counter, landing in front of Charlie, guns ready for action. But the boy is gone. \nMICHAEL Are you hurt? Charlie shakes her head no. \nCHARLIE Where is he?! That's when the electricity goes out once again, PLUNGING THE \nDINER BACK INTO DARKNESS. \nJEEP'S VOICE He's still in here! FLASHLIGHT BEAMS fan out across the diner. LIGHTING under chairs.    Under tables. \nBOB'S VOICE Where the fuck is he?! A SCAMPERING SOUND... MOVING FAST.    Everybody spins to track the location of the sound. \nAs soon as they move in one direction, the SCAMPERING is heard in another. Jeep's LIGHT CATCHES SOMETHING ON THE GROUND.      A TRAIL OF \nBLOOD. \nJEEP He's bleeding! \nTHE BEAMS OF LIGHT JOIN TOGETHER, MOVING FAST TO TRACK THE \nBLOOD ACROSS THE DINER WHERE IT ENDS AT... \nA WALL... Jeep raises his LIGHT UP THE WALL WHERE THE TRAIL OF BLOOD \n", "test2_id": 1264, "test3_input": "BOB Run. And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nAudrey and Jeep push the desk away from the door. Charlie opens it.    Sand swirls in around her. And Jeep leads the trio out the door. \nINT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME \nMichael and Gabriel square off in the diner, not like enemies, but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible family conflict. \nMICHAEL I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You were always so eager to please Him. \nGABRIEL Unlike you...the rebellious son. (noticing Michael's scars) Pity about your wings. They would have helped you now. \nMICHAEL To not feel their burden...is a dream. \nGABRIEL You think you can defy Him and not pay the price? \nMICHAEL The child lives. What happens to me doesn't matter now. \nGABRIEL Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You can help them sneak out the back door, but they won't escape. \n(BEAT) And neither will you, brother. Michael slowly approaches Gabriel. \nMICHAEL \n(SOFT) I'm not running anymore. Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face.    This was not what he was expecting. \nMICHAEL \n(SENSING) Join with me. You don't need do this. There's another way. A beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens. \nGABRIEL There is no other way... He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! -- LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it wasn't bad-ass enough. And the fight begins. \nIt's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior weapon. With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. The place is getting absolutely shot to hell. Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches. Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to fire. Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight into the barrel of Michael's MP5. The gun explodes in Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he lands on the counter. Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest, sending him fluttering back. Michael thrusts himself to his feet.   Gabriel recovers, jabs again. Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support and lifts his body just above the deadly spike. Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him. Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of punches. Gabriel is rattled back by the assault.   He clumsily lifts his mace and thrusts with it. Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a wall. Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones. A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing back, losing his grip on the weapon. Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back. Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael off. They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on. Choking the life out of Gabriel. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nAudrey and Jeep help Charlie quickly move around the side of the diner where the cruiser is parked. They are buffeted by winds and sand. Jeep puts Charlie and the baby into the front passenger seat while Audrey hustles in back. \nJeep rounds to the driver's side.     Hops in. \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS \nJeep frantically tries to get the right key into the ignition. It's in. Jeep turns the key but the ENGINE STRUGGLES TO FIRE UP. Panic. \nCHARLIE Come on, Jeep! \nJEEP I'm trying! Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING. A DARK SHAPE POUNCES ONTO THE HOOD OF THE CAR. The light catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a SHOPPING MALL SANTA CLAUS, his oversized belly gruesomely distended. Charlie screams. \nJEEP Fuck! Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE! The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass \n", "test3_true": "REVERSE) Hang on! Jeep floors it, causing the cruiser to rocket backwards toward the highway. \nBUT THE CREATURE HANGS ON! Jeep pulls the wheel hard and the cruiser whips around a full 180 onto the road. \nTHE CREATURE SHOOTS OFF THE CAR AND HITS THE ASPHALT. Jeep throws it in drive just as the POSSESSED SANTA rises from the pavement. Pedal to the metal. \nThe creature doesn't have a chance as the cruiser PLOWS into him. BONES CRUNCH as a flash of red and white is sent sailing over the car and tumbling down onto the road behind them in a cloud of dust. Jeep clenches the wheel, pedal to the floor. \nJEEP Okay, we need to figure out our weapon situation.   Hopefully Michael didn't take everything out of the car. Jeep places his Glock on the dash. He sees that he's got a police issue shotgun in the front seat rack. Charlie searches under her seat.   Pulls out a...GRENADE. \nCHARLIE Is this what I think it is? \nJEEP Yes. Now just put it down... Slowly. Charlie places it onto the seat. Audrey fishes around in the backseat. \nAUDREY (holding up each item) Okay, all I got is a flare gun thing. Looks like we got a box of flares to go with it. \nJEEP Okay. Okay. Handgun. Shotgun. A a flare gun... And a grenade. Alright. (hands Charlie the Glock) Load this. \n(BEAT) Audrey, can you figure out how to load that flare gun without killing us all? \nAUDREY I can try. \nJEEP Try real hard, okay? Audrey anxiously sets about loading the flare gun. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME \nGabriel flies into a wall in an attempt to crush Michael.    He fails that but succeeds in leaving a massive dent. Gabriel runs/flies for the opposite wall. This one doesn't hold and the two enemies crash through it into the bathroom. Unbelievably Michael is still holding on. Gabriel is up. He thrusts himself back into the bathroom mirror. It shatters painfully behind Michael. Gabriel rages out of the bathroom and into the diner. Michael continues to ride him like a wild bull. Gabriel slams Michael into a wall once more.   It's a brutal struggle. Gabriel spots his mace sticking out of the wall within arms reach. He grabs it, holding it futilely in front of him. From this angle he'd never be able to hit Michael with it. Gabriel's strength is giving way. Michael is winning. Gabriel lets out a tremendous ROAR and plunges one of the mace's long spikes into his own stomach. Michael's eyes go wide with surprise, his grip loosens. Gabriel has run them both through. Gabriel rips the mace from his body and stumbles forward. Blood pours from a huge hole in Michael's chest.   Right through his heart. Gabriel looks down at the hole in his own belly. Not nearly as bad as Michael's. Apparently there's not a lot of blood left in this guy. Michael falls to his knees.   Weakening. Gabriel looms over Michael.   Michael looks up at him, blood leaking from his mouth. \nGABRIEL You always wanted to live like one of them...Now you'll know how it feels to die like one of them. Gabriel raises the mighty mace above his head. Michael closes his eyes.   Submitting. The mace comes swinging down... \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - SAME \nThe cruiser hits the FLY STORM. Black. Nothing is visible beyond the windows. BUZZING surrounds them. DEAFENING. Jeep turns on the windshield wipers.     Hits the brights. PING!   PING!   PING!   Driving blind! ON THE SPEEDOMETER as their speed slows to a crawl. \nAUDREY Go faster! \nJEEP I can't fuckin' see! Charlie's desperately trying to soothe her SCREAMING baby. ON THE AIR VENTS as FLIES start crawling in. \nJEEP Oh, no. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nGabriel is looking down upon Michael's broken body. Something is happening to his skin. The DARK WRITING THAT COVERS HIS BODY is beginning UN-WRITE itself and DISAPPEAR... \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - SAME \nCharlie is struggling to close the air vents to stop the inflow of BUZZING insects. It's not working! She looks to Jeep in desperation, but something more frightening catches her attention. The INTRICATE WRITING is beginning to appear on Jeep's arm, snaking its way up from his wrists like VINES. \nCHARLIE Jeep, your arm! Jeep sees it, eyes go wide. \n", "test3_id": 1265}

{"train": "SANDRA I'm being punished for something, I know it. \nAcross the diner, Audrey goes back to swaying dreamily to the music, which is suddenly overtaken by BASS BUMPIN' HIP-HOP. \nCUT TO: \nDRIFTING OVER A VAST EXPANSE OF WESTERN DESERT The noontime sun bakes the strip of highway slicing through this barren country. A BLACK CADILLAC ESCALADE blazes a path.   HEAVY BEATS thunder from within. \nINT. ESCALADE - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS \nThe stereo in this rig could shake mountains. KYLE WILLIAMS (late 20's) handsome as hell, thug style. A straight up bad boy. He passes a weathered road sign: \n\"ENTERING PARADISE FALLS, NEXT SERVICES 50 MILES\" Kyle's expression says this is not good news. He grabs his cell phone off the passenger seat.   No signal. \nKYLE Shit... He spots the truck stop diner just up the road ahead... \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nThe Escalade pulls off the highway and rolls to a stop at the lonely row of old gas pumps. Kyle gets out and surveys the scenery with dismay. Now in the daytime we see this is truly a place time forgot. Attached to the diner is a MECHANIC'S BAY. Grease stains and rusty car parts litter the ground. Behind the place is the SILVERSTREAM TRAILER we saw Jeep step out of earlier. The only thing here that looks fairly new is the UHAUL TRUCK parked in front of the garage with its hood up. Kyle grabs a crumpled hand drawn map from the front seat and flattens it out on the roof of the car. He spins it around. Which way is north? \nKYLE Darren, your fuckin' directions suck, man. He checks his cell phone again. No chance of a signal way out here. So he shuffles around to the side of the diner in search of a pay phone. The good news is that he finds one.   The bad news is that it's been broken for ten years. Leaning next to the broken phone, however, is Charlie wearing a shabby, faded WAITRESS uniform stretched tight around her very pregnant belly. Adding to her perfect mother-to-be look is that cigarette dangling from her lips. The plastic name tag pinned to her chest says \"CHARLIE\". \nKYLE Hey... She eyes him, mildly intrigued, takes a drag. \nKYLE You know that shit right there ain't good for the baby. She lets out a long slow exhale. \nCHARLIE Guess I should think `bout quittin' then. \nKYLE Now hold on, girl, let me bum one before you do. \nCHARLIE You can buy a whole pack inside. \nKYLE Tell ya what. You let me have one of yours, and I'll give you two from the new pack you're gonna sell me. She considers him for a moment, then pulls out a cigarette. Lights it off the end of hers then hands it to him. Kyle takes a drag, pulls out his crumpled map. \nKYLE Am I in the right place? \nCHARLIE (peers at the map) Only if nowhere's right, `cause that's where you are. \nKYLE Sonuvabitch. There another phone around here? You know, one that works? \nCHARLIE Bob'll probably let you use the diner phone if you ask him real nice...And pay `im somethin'. \nKYLE I can handle that.   You got pancakes here? \nCHARLIE Yeah, we got a buttermilk stack for three seventy-five. We also got french toast for four dollars if you're into that. I personally like the pancakes though. \nJEEP (O.S.) You okay, Charlie? They both turn to see Jeep behind the diner, wearing mechanic's coveralls and holding a DUSTY OLD CRIB. Charlie quickly hides her cigarette behind her back. Busted. \nCHARLIE Yeah, I'm okay. This guy's just lost. Jeep nods, uncertain, eyes Kyle another moment, then he shuffles along out of sight. Charlie brings the cigarette back up to her lips. An awkward beat. \nKYLE Three seventy-five, huh? \nJEEP Nothin'... Jeep tries feebly to block his path, fails. Bob looks down at the crib with dismay. \nJEEP Found it under a bunch of stuff in the storage shed. I know you never like to throw anything away... Bob considers him, softens. \nBOB Whaddya doin'? \nJEEP What...? \nBOB Jeep, I like Charlie. I do. And I think it's real good of you to lend her a helping hand, but she is not your responsibility. \nJEEP (heard this before, pushes past him) Oh whatever, leave me alone. \nBOB Don't walk away from me while I'm talkin' to you! \nEXT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nJeep walks out toward the gas pumps, but Bob's right alongside him, not giving up. \nBOB How long you gonna follow her around like a puppy dog? Cleanin' up the messes she makes while she steps out with every guy around here other than you?! Jeep stiffens.   Turns to his father: \nJEEP Don't say that about her!     She's not like that! \nBob gives Jeep a hard stare.    Yeah, she is. \nBOB You really think she's gonna stick around here after that baby's born and off her hands? Jeeps shakes his head, burns. \nJEEP Look, I know it doesn't make any sense to you, but it's just something I have to do. Bob sighs, feels for his boy. \nBOB (points up at the PARADISE FALLS sign) See that up there? Your mother thought I was crazy for wanting to buy this place, middle of nowhere...But I just knew this was what I was supposed to do. Told your mom, \"just wait.\" Told her when they finally ran the freeway through here like they were plannin' on, this place would be like Grand Central Station. \n(BEAT) But I was wrong. The freeway never came and now the only people who ever stop here are the ones who are lost. \n(BEAT) And your mom? Well she got tired of waitin'. \nJEEP C'mon Dad. You can't blame yourself for what she did-- \nBOB Yeah, I can. And I'm sayin' you're about to make the same damn mistake I made, believing in something that's never gonna happen...Or someone. \n(BEAT) It's time for you to move on from this place, Jeep. I don't wanna see you wake up one morning old and pissed off, realizing you're lost just like everybody else who stops here. \nJeep looks up at his father, his words hanging heavily.    A tough pill to swallow. \nBOB Now get to work on that truck. I wanna have these people on the road by nightfall. Bob walks back into the diner. Jeep is about to turn back to the garage when he notices something off in the distance. Ominous DARK CLOUDS line the horizon to the south like a living wall. He shifts his gaze up the highway to the north. Same thing. DARK CLOUDS are pushing their way over the distant mountains. A storm is coming. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME \nBob reenters the diner to find Kyle sitting at the counter, digging into a plate of banana pancakes. Kyle is about to address him again, when something else steals Bob's attention. \nBOB (holding up a silencing \nHAND) Yeah, wait a minute. The TV has gone on the fritz again.   Only now the image is mostly snow. Bob climbs back onto the chair.   Faces the TV. \nKyle sits at a messy desk in this dark, wood paneled back office, phone to his ear. \nKYLE (CONT'D) (on phone) Cuz a father should be able to talk to his son, that's why. Now put `im on the phone. (a beat then a smile) Is that my little man...? Yeah, well I'm working hard, so that I can be with you. You bein' good? (strange STATIC can be \nHEARD) Wait... You're breakin' up. Hello...? (hangs up in frustration) Shit! Kyle stews a beat, then picks up the phone to redial. Frowns. No dial tone. \nKYLE What the hell... He keeps trying.    Nothing. \nHOWARD (V.O.) Maybe there was an earthquake? \nINT. DINER - SAME \nEveryone is looking at Howard. \nHOWARD They keep sayin' we're overdue for a big one. \nPERCY Lot a folks could be hurt. \nBOB Not if it was centered in the desert. \nHOWARD Exactly.    Could be nothing to worry about. \nSANDRA So then why's the TV out? \nHOWARD Maybe it just hit the relay stations. Aren't those usually in remote areas? \nBOB Yeah, `cause of the radiation they give off. \nPERCY There ain't no radiation comin' from those things. Plus that don't explain the radio being out too. Some of those stations broadcast over hundreds of miles. Any quake that big and we would a felt it. \nCHARLIE Percy's right. I didn't feel nothing. \nAUDREY Maybe it's a terrorist attack or something...? \nSANDRA (covers her mouth) Oh god... Everyone considers that grimly, then: \nBOB Well, for cryin' out loud. There's no use in speculating. I'll just call my brother up in Needles. He must a heard something. \nKYLE (O.S.) I don't think so. Kyle has reappeared in the diner. \nBOB Whaddya talkin' about? \nKYLE Phone's dead. Just tried to make a call. \nBOB You're shittin' me. Kyle shakes his head, sits down at the counter. \nSANDRA Oh, this is just great. \nBOB Relax, Mrs. Anderson. Nothing to get excited about. Probably just working on the lines. \n(MORE) \nKyle, Percy, Sandra and Audrey frantically carry Howard, his neck bandaged, to the back of the Escalade. \nINT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS \nHoward lies in the back seat. Sandra by his head, clasping his hands in hers. Audrey by his feet. Percy rides shotgun. Kyle struggles to get the key in the ignition. The engine ROARS to life. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nThe Escalade fishtails onto the highway. \nINT. ESCALADE - CONTINUOUS \nKyle grips the wheel.   Picking up speed. \nKYLE How far to the hospital? \nPERCY Seventy, maybe eighty miles. Kyle shoots him a look. Eighty miles?! Pedal to the floor time. Audrey leans forward from the back seat. \nAUDREY What's that on the road? Up ahead, the DARK CLOUDS Jeep saw earlier have finally closed in, descending onto the highway like a WALL. \nKYLE They're fuckin' clouds!   What the fuck do they look like? \nAUDREY Not clouds. Clouds don't buzz. She's right.    They're black... Undulating... BUZZING! \nPING!   PING!   PING! Suddenly HUNDREDS OF TINY BUGS begin to HIT the windshield -- \nSPLAT! And that's when they realize it... Those aren't clouds. \nTHEY'RE FLIES! The Escalade enters the SWARM. The car is PUMMELED by insects, the windshield instantly covered in BLACK AND RED bug guts. Driving blind! The sound of FLIES SPLATTERING and BUZZING is deafening! Everyone SCREAMS as hell surrounds them... \nINT. DINER BATHROOM - SAME \nBob is hunched over the steaming sink, pounding a can of light beer. Jeep is leaning against the wall, looking like he's about to puke or faint. \nBOB I don't understand how she was still standin' after Percy hit `er with that goddamn fryin' pan. Broke her fuckin' neck. I saw it. I swear I did. \n(BEAT) And did you see that kid's gun? The hell's he doin' with a gun like that? Bob looks over at Jeep, sees him trembling. \nBOB It's okay, Jeep.   It's okay. But for Jeep it's not okay.   He's hurting real bad inside. \nJEEP I couldn't pull the trigger. I froze. I saw what I needed to do, but I was afraid... (breaks down) She could've killed you! \n(MORE) \nJEEP (cont'd) Or Charlie...She would've killed me if it wasn't for... He can't get the words out.   Bob rests a hand on his boy's shoulder. \nBOB There's nothin' to be ashamed of, Jeep. \n(BEAT) Not everybody can play the hero. Before Jeep can respond, they hear the sound of the front \nDOOR JINGLE. \nKYLE No Twilight Zone shit if that's what you mean. Jeep slips the key into the driver's side door.     Unlocks it. \nBOB Careful. Old lady could have some kind of rabid poodle locked up in there. Jeep slowly swings the door open and that's when the smell hits them. \nKYLE Agh!   What the fuck is that? Bob covers his nose. \nBOB Jesus. Kyle opens the passenger door, looks in.      Dark, dirty.   But nothing unusual. \nKYLE Nothin' here. \nJEEP How `bout the trunk? They go around to the BACK OF THE CAR.   Jeep slips the key in. The trunk POPS open, revealing a PILE OF DEAD CATS.   ROTTING. \nMAGGOT INFESTED. Bob quickly slams the trunk closed.    The guys are reeling with disgust. Kyle's trying to blow the stench from his nose. \nKYLE Bitch's got motherfuckin' dead cats in her hoopty! What the fuck is wrong with white people?! \nBOB Least now we know where that smell was coming from. \nKYLE Yeah, it was a real motherfuckin' necessity we figured that out, man. \nJEEP (sees something up the \nROAD) Hey... They turn to see HEADLIGHTS growing larger in the dim haze. A POLICE CRUISER careens off the highway and skids to a wild stop in front of the diner. Its ENGINE RATTLES as the dust clears around it. No movement can be seen behind its bug splattered windows. \nBOB Okay, now we're talkin'. \nJEEP Wait a minute. Check it out. It's LAPD. What's an LA cop doing way out here? Bob and Jeep look over at Kyle. \nKYLE I'm from Nevada, man. They consider the police car a moment more. See the SHATTERED PASSENGER WINDOW, the BLOOD STAINS. \nBOB Give me the shotgun. Kyle hands the shotgun over to Bob. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nCharlie's face lights up when she sees the police car. \nCHARLIE Oh, thank God, the police! \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nThe door of the POLICE CAR OPENS as Charlie races from the diner. The three men see her moving toward the car.    Jeep's face goes slack. \nJEEP Charlie, wait! The men begin to run toward her... While out of the police car steps... \nMICHAEL Charlie freezes a few feet from the car when she sees those piercing eyes already familiar to us. Michael looks at her, as if she was exactly who he expected to see. In moments Bob, Kyle and Jeep form a protective shield in front of Charlie. Bob raises the shotgun. \nBOB Take one step closer and I'll drop you right here. A long beat as Michael considers Bob.   Icy cold. \nMICHAEL That how you greet all your customers? \nBOB Mister, after what we've been through here today, you're lucky we didn't shoot you first and greet you later. Now let me see your teeth. Michael stares at him blankly. \nAUDREY Shut up, mom! \nAudrey pulls her mother back into the diner. Michael hands an MP5 SUB-MACHINE GUN to Kyle. Another one goes to Percy. Finally he places a third one in Jeep's hands, who stares down at it anxiously. \nBOB Wait. I don't think that's such a good idea. \nJEEP Dad, I can handle it. \nBOB (to Michael) He's just a kid -- \nJEEP I said, I can handle it! Michael's eyes narrow, studying Jeep. \nMICHAEL He can handle it. He doesn't have a choice. Michael pulls out twin MP5s for himself. GLOCK 9s are tucked everywhere they can go. Michael tosses clip belts to the men. Boxes of shotgun shells. The works. \nMICHAEL If you want to live, you'll do exactly as I say. He slams the trunk closed and approaches Charlie.   He cocks a Glock and hands it to her. \nMICHAEL When you fire, you keep your thumb off the slide. Don't hesitate. Don't do anything brave. There's no safety. He gives her a hard look.   She nods nervously.   Trusting him but not sure why. Michael marches into the diner. Kyle glances quickly at the others, then he bolts after Michael. Percy follows.   Then Charlie. Now it's only Jeep and his father left. \nBOB C'mon, Jeep. We gotta go! \nAnd Bob rushes into the diner. A moment as Jeep looks out toward the road. \nTHE HEADLIGHTS ARE GROWING BRIGHTER.       CLOSER. He contemplates the sub-machine gun in his hands. \nJEEP Fuck it. And races after his father. \nCUT TO: \nA DEAD BOLT Thrown.   Locking the diner door. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nFrantic activity. Kyle and Michael push a booth in front of the door, sealing off the entrance. Tables are turned on their sides to form makeshift shields. Window blinds are snap closed. \nTHE BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS Jeep races in, locks the back door.       Then he pushes a desk in front of it. \nIN THE DINER - CONTINUOUS The place is transformed. Locked up tight.        The ROAR OF ENGINES outside grows ever LOUDER, CLOSER. Sandra huddles on the floor with Howard, his head in her lap. She's running her hands gently through his hair, trying to keep calm. He opens his eyes. Pale, weak from blood loss. \nHOWARD Sandra?    What's happening? \nSANDRA It's okay!     Everything's okay! Sandra closes her eyes.        Struggling to believe it. Suddenly the ELECTRICITY GOES OUT, dipping the room into \nDARKNESS. \nWe hear CRIES OF ALARM.   TOTAL BLACK.   Chaos. \nBOB (V.O.) Jeep, get the flashlights! \nPERCY (V.O.) Everybody just stay still! \nKYLE (V.O.) Now that we're locked in here, what the fuck are we supposed to do? A flicker of LIGHT. And then FLASHLIGHT BEAMS CUT THROUGH THE DARKNESS...coming to rest on Michael's pale face. Michael looks up at the ceiling. \nMICHAEL Now!   Shoot now! The men let loose with FEROCIOUS FIREPOWER. \nWINDSHIELDS SHATTER!    TIRES BLOW OUT!   ENGINES EXPLODE! Vehicles swerve and COLLIDE! DARK SHAPES bolt from the burning vehicles, scattering. In the FLASH OF BATTLE we catch glimpses of them: BUSINESS \nPEOPLE. CONSTRUCTION WORKERS. EVEN AN ENTIRE HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM. All deformed by some demonic force. Many mere BALLS OF FLAME drifting through the darkness. \nMICHAEL Spread out! Don't let them get close to the windows! The DARK SHAPES converge on the diner from all directions. They move so strangely fast it seems that their feet don't actually touch the ground. From the roof it's a full-on turkey shoot as the men follow Michael's instructions and cut down everything in sight. Their faces lighting up with each FLASH. SHELL CASINGS spray from their weapons like water drops from a sprinkler. BODIES BURST and crumble to the dirt. The creatures don't seem to be afraid of dying. Their strategy appears to be in their sheer numbers. With each wave, the dark figures get ever closer to the diner. \nON BOB firing madly.    Then...   CLICK!   CLICK!   Oh, no.   He's out of ammo. \nBOB Shells! Percy tosses him a box of shells. But Bob fumbles the catch and the box slides halfway down the sloped roof. \nBOB Fuck! With the gun still in one hand, Bob reaches frantically down for the ammo. Stretching... Further... \nA HIDEOUSLY WOUNDED MIDDLE-AGED HOUSEWIFE CATAPULTS UP FROM BELOW THE ROOFLINE! Her hair must have been in curlers before most of it BURNED AWAY. Her nightdress hangs in tatters off her body. Her jaw CLICKS RAPIDLY, as she clatters up at Bob like a GIANT INSECT. Bob tries to pull back, but he has no traction and he starts to slip down toward her. She's coming fast! Percy sees his friend in trouble. \nPERCY Bob! Bob swings the shotgun like a club -- CRACK! -- knocking the bitch clear off the roof. But the move has made his slide even faster. He drops the shotgun, trying to hold on, but he can't stop! \nBOB IS ABOUT TO HIT THE EDGE WHEN THE HORRID WOMAN POPS UP \nRIGHT IN FRONT OF HIM! She doesn't even have a chance to react as Bob does something akin to a swimmer's push right off her body! WHAM! The creature goes flying back off the roof and the opposing force halts Bob's slide. \nPERCY (extending his hook) Grab my hand! Bob reaches up and clasps Percy's hook, praying that it stays on. But this chick ain't finished yet. Up she comes once more. Her razor sharp fingernails claw up the metal roof. SCREECH! \nBOB Gun! \nPercy tosses Bob a Glock. Fortunately this time Bob deftly catches it with his free hand just as the deranged woman pounces on him. \nBOB (jamming the gun in her \nMOUTH) Fuck off! BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The back of her head EXPLODES. Her body goes limp. Bob struggles to push the corpse off of him. \nBOB Pull me up! Percy extends his hook hand, helping Bob ascend to safety. \nINT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME \nHiding in the shadows... listening to sounds of WAR just outside. Sandra squeezes her hands over her ears.   A few feet away, Audrey clutches a butcher's knife. Jeep's eyes darting from one window to another.   Trying to keep it together. Charlie is crouched down behind the counter, holding the handgun close to her pregnant belly. Distant EXPLOSIONS rattle the plates on the shelves. Charlie peers out from behind the counter to look at the front windows. Momentary FLASHES of intense light outline the closed blinds. Another FLASH lights up Charlie's face.    Staring. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME \nPercy is swivelling left and right, firing like mad. \nPERCY Come on, motherfuckers!   Come on! Closer and closer the creatures come.   Most are eviscerated by the fire from the rooftop. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nON CHARLIE staring at the window.    CLOSER.   Charlie's eyes go wide as -- SMASH!   A DARK SHAPE crashes through the window.    Glass, sand and dust swirl in. Audrey and Sandra SCREAM. Charlie springs up from her hiding place, gun ready. Jeep spins around, pointing his gun, searching frantically for the intruder. It's so dark! \nJEEP Where is it?! Audrey shakes her head, tears streaming down her cheeks. She looks over at her mother. Sandra's eyes are closed. It's too much. \nAUDREY Mom!   Open your eyes! \nCHARLIE \n(RECOVERING) I'm okay. I'm fine. She glances back at Michael.       He's watching her.   Those eyes. \nCHARLIE Thanks... \nMICHAEL I told you not to do anything brave. Charlie doesn't know how to respond.      She's about to say something when -- Kyle rushes into the room.       A smile on his face. \nKYLE We got `em runnin'! Then Kyle notices the broken window, takes in the room, his excitement falling. \nKYLE Where's Howard? No one responds.   Sandra and Audrey are huddled together. Crying. Bob and Percy follow Kyle in, still shaking from the adrenaline. \nMICHAEL Someone needs to be on the roof. \nKYLE I'll go. Bob grabs Kyle's arm. \nBOB Hold on. (approaches Michael, \nDETERMINED) You better start talking. All eyes on Michael.    These people want answers.      Finally: \nMICHAEL The first time God lost faith in Man he sent a flood. The second time...he sent what you see outside. Everyone takes that in for a moment, then: \nPERCY You sayin' this is the Apocalypse...? \nMICHAEL I'm saying this is an extermination. \n(BEAT) Those things out there are vessels. The Possessed. The weakest willed are the easiest to turn. \nKYLE Possessed by what?    Demons? \nMICHAEL No...by angels. That silences the room. \nPERCY (pulls out his bible) Son, I don't know what bible you been readin', but in my version, the angels are the good guys. Michael looks squarely at Percy. \nMICHAEL That's where your book is wrong. \nSANDRA How come you know so much about them? \nMICHAEL I know because until last night, I was on their side. \nJEEP You mean you're... Michael considers Jeep, then: \nMICHAEL Not anymore... \nBOB Right and yesterday I was the fuckin' Easter Bunny. You know, fuck this. I don't even believe in God. \nMICHAEL That's fine, because He doesn't believe in you either. Bob stares at Michael, uncertain how to respond to that. \nPERCY C'mon, Bob. Have you looked outside recently? Those aren't exactly our regular customers out there. \nBOB How do we know he didn't bring them here himself? \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE NIGHT \nPercy and Kyle keep watch, rifles at their sides. They're wrapped up from head to toe in blankets to protect them from the cold and the flies. Percy scans the horizon.   Momentary SPECTRAL FLASHES dot the darkness. \nPERCY They're out there. Sons of bitches. I can feel `em. \n(BEAT) Damn it's cold! Percy makes the unconscious motion of rubbing his \"hands\" together to keep them warm. Kyle notices. Sees the dog tags. \nKYLE You were in the Army? \nPERCY Navy, two tours. But the second one didn't work out so well, so I didn't get to go back for a third. Suppose that makes me lucky in a way. Served with Bob, you know. That's how I ended up in this place. \nKYLE What was it like?    Being in a war? \nPERCY Dark.   Like this. Kyle nods. Scared. He takes out his 45.     Nervously switches it from hand to hand. \nPERCY So what's with that gun? \nKYLE What? \nPERCY Your piece. The one you killed grandma with. Don't reckon it's for huntin' buck. \nKYLE No. I uh -- keep it for protection. \nPERCY Protection from what? \nKYLE From people. Percy looks at him skeptically. \nPERCY People. \nKYLE Yeah, people who might try to give me a hard time, you know? \nPERCY Just regular people or uh... \nKYLE Yeah, well, no, not regular, regular people. \nPERCY Irregular people then. \nKYLE I'm talkin' people whose job it is to give other people a hard time. Kinda person who doesn't get enough fiber in their diet, you know what I'm sayin? \nPERCY So it's a work thing, is it? \nKYLE Exactly.    Strictly business. \nPERCY This business of yours... You like it? Kyle's eyes narrow. \nKYLE Who the fuck are you to be sweatin' me, man? I got my reasons for doin' what I do. Percy just stares at him, penetrating.     Finally: \nPERCY When I was a kid my father would sit by my bed every night before I'd go to sleep and he'd say to me, Percy, if you don't wake up tomorrow, if it turns out that today was your last day on earth, would you be proud of what you've done in this life? Cuz if you ain't, then you better start gettin' square. Kyle looks at Percy, fear in his eyes, then he turns back to the darkness...and the evil that surrounds them. \nCUT TO: \nSandra splashes water on her face.   Stares at herself in the mirror. A living wreck. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nSandra steps out of the bathroom. \nVOICE (a whisper) Sandra... Sandra freezes. \nSANDRA Who's there? A beat then: \nVOICE Sandra... Sandra spins around.    Searching. \nSANDRA Howard?     Is that you? It sure sounded like Howard. \nVOICE Help me...     Please... This time, it's clear where the voice is coming from.      Sandra turns to face the BACK DOOR. A desk blocks it. Sandra ever so slowly approaches the door. \nVOICE (from behind the door) Help me. Sandra... Sandra is stricken.    What the hell is she going to do? That's when Sandra notices the TRANSOM WINDOW above the door. She climbs onto the desk and stretches up until she can see out. \nSANDRA'S POV: Howard. Her husband. Ten feet away from the door.     NAILED \nTO AN UPSIDE-DOWN CROSS. But wait. It gets worse. His skin is covered with horrible black boils. And even worse than that. Howard's boils are breathing. Sandra goes slack with horror. \nHOWARD Help me, please! Howard's torn open shirt reveals the BREATHING PUSTULES covering his body. He writhes in slow, excruciating agony. \nSANDRA Howard! Sandra scrambles down off the desk and frantically pushes it away from the door. She's reaching for the dead bolt when Audrey and Kyle appear in the doorway. \nAUDREY Mom! Kyle races to restrain Sandra. \nSANDRA Let me go!     He's alive! \nShe struggles against him, throwing a wild elbow that tags Kyle in the face. Down he goes. Sandra is about to open the door when Audrey pounces on her. \nINT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME \nThe SHOUTING from the back office awakens the rest of the sleepers. Percy springs up. Charlie is shaking Jeep. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME \nThe ROAR OF WIND ripping off the plain is all that can be heard. ON BOB as his head drops down with drunken fatigue. Sleep. \nRISING OVER HIM TO SEE... Howard nailed to the upside-down cross below. \nINT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - SAME \nSandra and Audrey are locked in battle. Sandra slaps Audrey hard. Audrey stumbles over Kyle and hits the floor. Percy appears in the doorway. Now is her last chance. Sandra whips open the back door and that's when the world hits SLOW MOTION. Howard is there.    A few feet away.   Alive. Sandra races toward him.    Just behind her comes Percy. \nSANDRA Howard! And that's when the speed ACCELERATES TO NORMAL -- -- and the boils covering Howard's body explode -- spraying streams of dark fluid toward Sandra -- -- just at the moment Percy spins around her, shielding her from the spray, which hits him in the back. But he's not stopping. Percy pushes Sandra back into the diner, the door SLAMMING closed behind them. Percy releases Sandra, letting her stumble hysterically into the room. Kyle and Jeep grab her, forcing her to the ground. But she's not fighting anymore. Charlie turns to look at Percy who is still standing with his back to the door, breathing heavily. \nCHARLIE Percy? He takes a step forward, then falls to ground. The entire back side of his body is gone.      Burned away. \nCUT TO: \nCharlie stands at the sink, cigarette to her lips, water running, stealing a private moment. She takes a deep drag, feels the smoke filling her lungs, defiant. Then she catches a look at herself in the mirror, runs her hand along the curvature of her belly. Tears well up in her eyes, fear and anger overtaking her. She stamps out the cigarette in a fit of frustration. \nINT. DINER - A SHORT WHILE LATER \nIt's quiet. DRIFTING past sleeping figures to find Charlie, wide-awake, sitting at a booth, lost in thought. \nJEEP (O.S.) Guess it's your turn not to sleep. Charlie looks up to see Jeep sit down across from her. \nCHARLIE Hey... Jeep sees the strain on her face. \nJEEP You okay? \nCHARLIE You mean besides the fact that I just found out that I'm the mother of the Messiah? Jeep smiles, nods. \nCHARLIE Crazy thing is...I didn't want this baby. I even went down to the clinic, you know that? (off Jeep's reaction:) I remember sitting there in the waiting room, absolutely sure I was doin' the right thing...And that's when the feeling started. Like I was falling into the deepest, darkest hole imaginable. I couldn't breathe, I couldn't speak. I kept thinking this must be what death is like. And when finally they called my name, I ran. \n(BEAT) For a while after that I tried pretending that it was just cold feet, that I could go back if I wanted to, that I could decide to end it like I'd planned. Then I'd start to have that feeling again and I knew I didn't have a choice. Somehow this had already been decided. And it made me hate this thing that's been growing inside me. A long beat, as Jeep considers her, then: \nJEEP You shouldn't say things like that, Charlie. It isn't right. You'll get through this. I know you will. She turns to him, the bitterness overtaking her: \nCHARLIE How come you have so much faith in me, Jeep? God knows I've never given you or anybody else a reason to. Or is it that you just can't find any other hard-luck case to follow around? Jeep's face hardens.   He gets up.   Hurt.   Frustrated. \nJEEP You know, you're not the only who's suffered, okay? Let me know when you stop feeling sorry for yourself. And with that, Jeep walks away, leaving Charlie to stare after him, disturbed and surprised by his response. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - LATE AFTERNOON \nSand and wind.    The INVISIBLE SUN is sinking. Kyle and Audrey are bundled together on the roof, keeping watch. Kyle is showing her how to hold the MP5. \nKYLE ...Then you just flip this -- Audrey flips the safety. \nAUDREY Yeah, I got it. All the way down. Two clicks. She points the gun out into the haze like she's been holding one all her life. Off Kyle's surprised look: \nAUDREY Dated this guy last summer. A marine. Had a thing for guns. Parents hated him. \nKYLE I bet they did. After a moment, Audrey switches the safety back on.   Hands the gun over to Kyle. Audrey stares into the red nothingness surrounding them. Her expression growing distant. She seems to have aged years overnight. \nAUDREY My parents hate everything I do. That's why we were moving. \nKYLE Yeah? \nAUDREY They thought a more \"wholesome\" environment would help me \"change my ways.\" So fucked up. Only reason they care at all is cuz they don't want to be embarrassed in front of their friends at the country club. Kyle considers her thoughtfully. \nKYLE The only time my old man ever paid attention to me was when I was doing somethin' bad. So you know what I did? \nAUDREY What? \nKYLE I got really good at being bad. She smiles at this confession.    Can obviously relate.   He wipes a tear from her cheek. She leans in.   Kisses him.   Passionately.   Desperately. His hands trace over her body. She claws at him. Her passion growing out of control. She's practically devouring him. Kyle can barely keep up. It's like something else beyond sensual need has taken over. She moves down his chest.     Further.   Kyle leans his head back. Further. Just then the SPOT LIGHTS that illuminate the roof sign come to life.   The young couple stops to look up at the brilliant red word \"Paradise\" illuminated above them. Down below, the gas pumps LIGHT UP.      The station's FLUORESCENTS flicker on. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - SAME \nThe Possessed move in from all sides, but Kyle is remarkably agile, dropping one after another in a stunning display. He closes in on the family, blasting back the creatures huddled around them. He finds the YOUNG BOY curled up with his hands protectively covering his face. Kyle swoops down and gathers the boy into his arms. \nKYLE I got you! Kyle moves on to the mother. But something odd is happening. The creatures have stopped coming at him. In fact, they're just standing there watching him.   Waiting. Kyle freezes.   CLOSE ON HIM as he senses something terribly wrong. \nYOUNG BOY (O.S.) Mister... Kyle looks over at the boy in his arms.   GHOSTLY WHITE EYES stare back at him. \nYOUNG BOY \n(WHISPERS) Fooled ya. \nA FLASH OF TEETH AS KYLE'S THROAT IS TORN OUT. Kyle drops to his knees. Up on the roof, Audrey watches helplessly as Kyle falls. \nAUDREY Kyle! \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nBob kicks over a table in disgust. \nBOB Damn it all to hell! \nCHARLIE Oh, no.   Audrey... Out the window they see Audrey drop down from the roof and run towards Kyle. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nThe young boy stands over Kyle, silently watching the life drain from his body. The boy looks up to see Audrey approaching fast. Tears suddenly appear in his eyes. He opens his arms pleadingly to her. \nYOUNG BOY I'm sorry!     I didn't mean to! \nAUDREY Fuck you! Audrey raises the 45 and ...     CLICK.   CLICK.   CLICK. She keeps pulling the trigger.    Nothing. The boy's tears stop instantly. He looks at her with an eerie calm for someone so young. \nYOUNG BOY You're gonna die now. The boy moves toward Audrey, stepping over Kyle's body. Audrey backs away. She looks toward the entrance to the diner. Blocked by advancing creatures. They're everywhere.    She's trapped. She notices the open door to the MINIVAN.     And so she BOLTS. Audrey dives into the car as the throng of creatures rapidly closes in. She hammers the auto door lock. CLUNK! She moves to the center of the car as gruesome faces press against the windows. A nightmare come to life. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nPanic. Charlie rushes to Michael's side. \nCHARLIE Do you have no heart?!     She's just a kid! But he's immovable. \nCHARLIE You can't let her die! (grabbing a gun from the \nTABLE) I swear if you don't do something, I will! Charlie COCKS the gun, moves toward the door. \nMICHAEL Wait. \nCharlie looks back at him, defiant.   No one breathes.   Then: \nMICHAEL (raising his guns) Open the door. Bob springs into action, clearing the door and flipping the dead bolt. The door is opened and Michael charges passed Charlie and out into hell. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nWith stunning calm, Michael marches straight for the pumps. IN THE MINIVAN, Audrey screams as the windows begin to CRACK. She's running out of time. Michael grabs a gas pump, flips the lever and points it at the minivan. What's he up to? The creatures covering the car turn to look at Michael as if they've just now noticed him. And that's when he starts spraying gas at them. But wait, there's more to this trick. Up comes Michael's Glock in his other hand and BLAM! BLAM! BLAM! The spray of gas EXPLODES into a SPRAY OF FIRE! The MINIVAN is engulfed in flames. Creatures tear away from the car like fiery comets through the night. The windows EXPLODE, showering Audrey with tiny shards of glass. Michael drops the gas pump. He reaches through a fire rimmed broken car window and unlocks the door. Audrey looks up to see Michael's expressionless face CIRCLED \nREACHES THE CEILING AND...STOPS. \nBOB What the fuck? \nSCREECH!   THE BLOODY BOY SPRINGS OFF A TABLE BEHIND THEM AND \nLANDS ON BOB'S BACK. Bob flails around trying to pull the boy's small, but deadly strong arms away from his neck. \nJEEP Dad! Jeep can't get a clear shot.       Bob's gasping for air. Michael grabs the boy and fiercely rips him off of Bob's back. He swings the boy around like a living shot put. \nMICHAEL Get ready! Jeep and Bob whip up their guns as Michael throws the wicked creature into the air. Sandra's vacant face flickers in the light as the SOUND OF GUNFIRE AND INHUMAN SCREAMING fill the diner. And then in moments...      All is QUIET. BEHIND THE COUNTER, Audrey helps Charlie to her feet.       She WINCES. Doubles over, clutching her stomach. \nCHARLIE Oh, no! Michael lowers his flashlight.      CLEAR FLUID runs down Charlie's legs. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.   PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT \nInky darkness.   A flickering light emanates from within the diner. TITLE:   \"December 25th - 3:33am\" The sound of CHARLIE'S SCREAM, carries us to: \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - LATE NIGHT \nCharlie, drenched in sweat is writhing on the ground with Michael holding down her arms and Audrey kneeling between her legs. Pots of steaming water surround them. \nAUDREY What am I supposed to do? Just `cause I'm a girl doesn't mean I automatically know how to do this! \nMICHAEL Just do as I say. \nAUDREY Yeah, but, how do you know how to do this?! \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - ROOF - SAME \nBob and Jeep keep watch. The SPECTRAL LIGHTS in the distance seem to be growing larger -- closer. Charlie's SCREAMING rises up from below. \nBOB What a way to bring a child into the world. (looks over at Jeep) She ever tell you his name? \nJEEP She's never said. I just assumed it was Joe Danvers. You know how she's always had a thing for bad boys. Bob hears the spite in Jeep's voice. \nBOB Jeep, sooner or later she'll realize you're the best thing that's ever happened to her. \nJEEP I thought you said I should move on? \nBOB Can't a father be wrong sometimes? Jeep considers Bob with a smile, then comes the sound... A DEEP, LONG, BODY RUMBLING TONE rising up off the plain, as if emanating from the largest HORN ever constructed. \nJEEP What was that...? The SPECTRAL LIGHTS dot the landscape now with untold numbers. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nMichael reacts to the sound. An urgency comes over him. Audrey arrives with more steaming water. \nAUDREY What is that?! \n(BEAT) Mama? If Sandra hears her daughter, it doesn't show in her face. Tears well up in Audrey's eyes as she moves away from her mother. But we HOLD here and... DRIFT DOWN BEHIND THE CHAIR TO REVEAL Sandra's hands are loosening the bonds. BLOOD TRICKLES from where the rope's cut through her skin. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nDRIFTING THROUGH the dark shapes as the BABY'S CRIES reverberate up and down the ranks. They begin to look about frantically, agitated by the sound. Some even begin to back away from the diner. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DESERT - CONTINUOUS \nOff in the distance, the diner is but a dim flickering light above the plain. It could almost be mistaken for a stable in a desert town a long time ago. THREE STARS burn bright and low in the black sky. All around us the DARK CREATURES are cowering from sound of the CRYING INFANT whose wails seem to grow even LOUDER the further away from the diner we get. \nHIGH ABOVE THE TRUCK STOP In the darkness below we see the lights of the legions of creatures dot the landscape and at the center of it all, the truck stop. The sound of WINGS BEATING AGAINST THE WIND. \nAND WE'RE DRIFTING DOWN TOWARD THE DINER ENTRANCE.   LIKE A \nBIRD CIRCLING ITS PREY. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nJeep and Bob enter the diner to see Michael helping Charlie to her feet, while Audrey continues to pace, the bundle of bloody blankets cradled in her arms. \nJEEP Something's happening.    They're moving away. \nMICHAEL The Possessed can't come near the child, so He sent someone that can. Someone like me. \nBOB Who? \nMICHAEL Gabriel. My lieutenant.      He's come to do what I wouldn't. ON JEEP as the realization hits him. \nJEEP Your orders... Michael looks at Jeep. \nJEEP You were the one who was supposed to kill the baby? That was the order you didn't obey. Michael nods grimly.    Charlie looks urgently at Michael. \nCHARLIE What's he talking about? The baby CRIES LOUDER. \nCHARLIE Michael, what the hell's he talking about?! \nMICHAEL There was never meant to be a Second Coming. But we've just changed that. The child lives. The future is unwritten. There's still hope. Charlie, shaken by this revelation, reaches out to Audrey. \nCHARLIE Audrey...? Audrey moves to hand over the baby to Charlie... \n...AND THAT'S WHEN SANDRA SPRINGS OUT OF HER CHAIR AND \nSNATCHES THE BABY FROM AUDREY'S ARMS! Sandra backs away from them, moving toward the front door. Hers is the face of madness. \nSANDRA Stay away from me!    Don't come any closer! \nAUDREY Mom! \nBOB Don't do it, lady! \nBOB Run. And so Jeep, fighting back tears, does what his father says. \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - BACK OFFICE - CONTINUOUS \nAudrey and Jeep push the desk away from the door. Charlie opens it.    Sand swirls in around her. And Jeep leads the trio out the door. \nINT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME \nMichael and Gabriel square off in the diner, not like enemies, but like brothers on opposite sides of a terrible family conflict. \nMICHAEL I knew he'd send you, Gabriel. You were always so eager to please Him. \nGABRIEL Unlike you...the rebellious son. (noticing Michael's scars) Pity about your wings. They would have helped you now. \nMICHAEL To not feel their burden...is a dream. \nGABRIEL You think you can defy Him and not pay the price? \nMICHAEL The child lives. What happens to me doesn't matter now. \nGABRIEL Yours is a fool's sacrifice. You can help them sneak out the back door, but they won't escape. \n(BEAT) And neither will you, brother. Michael slowly approaches Gabriel. \nMICHAEL \n(SOFT) I'm not running anymore. Gabriel hesitates, doubt clouding his face.    This was not what he was expecting. \nMICHAEL \n(SENSING) Join with me. You don't need do this. There's another way. A beat, then Gabriel's expression hardens. \nGABRIEL There is no other way... He pulls back from Michael, raising the mace -- SCHING! -- LONG DEADLY SHARP SPIKES BURSTS FROM ALL ITS SIDES...as if it wasn't bad-ass enough. And the fight begins. \nIt's mace against machine gun and strangely enough, it seems under Gabriel's deft control, the mace is the vastly superior weapon. With the aid of his wings, Gabriel moves with staggering speed, defying gravity to avoid the rain of bullets. The place is getting absolutely shot to hell. Michael leaps from table top to table top as Gabriel brings the mace brutally down -- splintering everything it touches. Michael leaps onto the last unbroken table top -- spins to fire. Gabriel pushes into the air, jabbing a spike straight into the barrel of Michael's MP5. The gun explodes in Michael's hands, sending him rocketing backwards where he lands on the counter. Gabriel swoops in fast. Michael kicks him in the chest, sending him fluttering back. Michael thrusts himself to his feet.   Gabriel recovers, jabs again. Michael grabs a hold of Bob's ceiling mounted TV for support and lifts his body just above the deadly spike. Michael kicks Gabriel in the head, momentarily stunning him. Michael dives at Gabriel, landing an awesome flurry of punches. Gabriel is rattled back by the assault.   He clumsily lifts his mace and thrusts with it. Michael narrowly evades the razor point, which drives into a wall. Michael smashes down on Gabriel's wrist, CRACKING the bones. A swift kick to the chest and Gabriel is thrust crashing back, losing his grip on the weapon. Michael takes a running leap onto Gabriel's back. Gabriel launches wildly into the air, trying to throw Michael off. They hit the ceiling, but Michael hangs on. Choking the life out of Gabriel. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - CONTINUOUS \nAudrey and Jeep help Charlie quickly move around the side of the diner where the cruiser is parked. They are buffeted by winds and sand. Jeep puts Charlie and the baby into the front passenger seat while Audrey hustles in back. \nJeep rounds to the driver's side.     Hops in. \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS \nJeep frantically tries to get the right key into the ignition. It's in. Jeep turns the key but the ENGINE STRUGGLES TO FIRE UP. Panic. \nCHARLIE Come on, Jeep! \nJEEP I'm trying! Jeep gives it some gas, but the ENGINE'S NOT CATCHING. A DARK SHAPE POUNCES ONTO THE HOOD OF THE CAR. The light catches it, revealing the disfigured face and beard of a SHOPPING MALL SANTA CLAUS, his oversized belly gruesomely distended. Charlie screams. \nJEEP Fuck! Jeep pumps the gas and the ENGINE BURSTS TO LIFE! The creature's about to punch a fist through the glass \nCHARLIE What is it? A beat, as Jeep remembers Michael's parting words... \nJEEP The instructions... \nINT. PARADISE GAS `N' GRUB - SAME \nGabriel watches as the last of the writing FADES from Michael's body when he hears a faint CLICKING sound from somewhere in the diner. Gabriel moves gracefully through the destroyed diner, toward the source of the CLICKING. He steps behind the counter and finds Bob lying in a massive pool of blood. It takes the creature a moment to realize that the CLICKING sound is coming from Bob's SILVER ZIPPO. Bob is focusing every last ounce of life in his body to lighting that lighter. CLICK... CLICK... CLICK... Bob looks at Gabriel. \nBOB Sorry...   We're closed. And with one last brush of his thumb, Bob's trusty ZIPPO \nIGNITES. Gabriel's eyes go wide as the TINY FLAME DANCES in front of the stove's broken gas line. Gabriel spins and runs like hell as the gas explodes. \nA STREAM OF FIRE ENGULFS HIM AS HIS WINGS UNFOLD AND HE LEAPS \nINTO AWESOME FIERY FLIGHT. \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS \nThe MASSIVE EXPLOSION rocks the slow moving vehicle. In the rearview mirror, Jeep sees the CLOUD OF FIRE MUSHROOMING UP in the sky behind them. It's eerily magnificent. \nCHARLIE The swarm, it's fading! Jeep looks back to the road as, sure enough, the FLY SWARM suddenly dissipates all around them, revealing a CLEAR VIEW of the highway ahead. Jeep knows at what price this good fortune has come. \nJEEP Thank you... \nAND THAT'S WHEN THE WORD \"PARADISE\" CRASHES DOWN LIKE A BALL \nOF FIRE ONTO THE ROAD DIRECTLY IN FRONT OF THEM! \nJEEP Oh, shit! \nEXT. HIGHWAY - CONTINUOUS \nThe cruiser PUNCHES through the burning \"Paradise\" sign, smashing it into fiery pieces! The cruiser charges on down the endless highway, burning bits of sign swirling in its wake. \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - CONTINUOUS \nFrom the back seat, Audrey watches the fire recede into the distance. \nAUDREY I can't believe it.   Is it really over...? Up front Jeep stares out at the dark road ahead. \nJEEP No...It's just starting... \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \nBurning wreckage everywhere. DRIFTING THROUGH IT until we settle on the SPIKE-SCEPTER stuck firmly in the ground. Flames ring the handle. \nEXT. HIGHWAY - SAME \nThe cruiser blazes down the highway. \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - DRIVING - SAME \nAUDREY (O.S.) Get off her, you fucking asshole! Audrey leaps onto Gabriel, pulling him away from Charlie just in time. He flails wildly about but this young girl rides him like one helluva a cowboy. \nAUDREY Do it, Jeep! Do it now! \nJEEP SLAMS ON THE BREAKS, SENDING GABRIEL AND AUDREY SHOOTING \nFORWARD THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD LIKE A BULLET. The intertwined bodies of Gabriel and Audrey hit the road with a sickening crunch and ROLL INTO A BALL OF FIRE. \nEXT. RED ROCK PARK - CONTINUOUS \nThe Cruiser spins out of control, swerving off the road and careening into a large rock formation. This ride is over. \nINT. POLICE CRUISER - CONTINUOUS \nJeep's side of the car is crushed.   Blood is running down his forehead. Charlie crawls up from the floor. \nCHARLIE C'mon, Jeep! \nHe tries to focus on her. \nCHARLIE Jeep! She kicks open her door and begins pulling him out. \nJEEP The baby? \nCHARLIE Alive. \nJEEP And what about... \nCHARLIE Nothing could have survived that. \nJEEP \n(ANGUISHED) Audrey... \nCHARLIE She saved us, Jeep. Audrey saved us. Now c'mon, we gotta go! Charlie, the baby bundled in her hands, leads Jeep away from the demolished Cruiser. \nEXT. RED ROCK RIDGE - PRE-DAWN \nJeep and Charlie, battered and bruised, struggle to make the long climb up the ridge. Charlie looks up. STARS completely fill the pre-dawn sky.   Breathtaking. \nCHARLIE How can this happen? \nJEEP What? \nCHARLIE How can this happen in a world so beautiful? Jeep follows her gaze to the sky. Endless stars.    Confounding. Jeep shifts his eyes to the TOP OF THE RIDGE just ahead. \nJEEP C'mon, we're almost there. They are only a few steps from the EDGE OF THE RIDGE when -- \nGABRIEL ROCKETS UP IN FRONT OF THEM! Charlie screams! Jeep pushes her and the baby out of the way just as Gabriel comes down hard in front of them, kicking up a cloud of dust. Gabriel's mechanical wings haltingly retract. The crash has done some serious damage. Much of his skin has burned away. Chunks of his armor and flesh are missing as well, including a large part of his head, revealing that under his human visage is a NIGHTMARISH CREATURE. Gabriel charges at Jeep fast. Jeep whips up his Glock, BLAM! Gabriel takes the bullet, then slaps the gun out of Jeep's hand. Jeep throws a wild punch, connects with Gabriel's chin, rocking him back. More annoyed than surprised, Gabriel knocks Jeep savagely to the ground. Jeep struggles quickly to his feet, comes right back at Gabriel swinging. But Gabriel simply knocks him to the dirt again. Jeep slowly gets up once more, bleeding, hurt.   Raises his fists. This kid will simply not give up. Jeep moves in again, swinging hard, but Gabriel blocks it, shoots out a hand and grabs Jeep by throat, lifting him clear off the ground. \nGABRIEL So brave. So pointless. You should have worried more about saving yourself. Jeep's feet dangle. His eyes bulge out. He claws at Gabriel's iron-fast grip, but there's no hope. Charlie watches in horror. \n", "test1_input": "LEGION \nWritten by \nPeter Schink & Scott Stewart \n10.31.07 Final Draft \nTITLE OVER BLACK \n\"Come, ye children, listen to me.

The unbearable heat will soon become an unbearable cold. A YOUNG WOMAN'S VOICE.    Solemn.   Weary.   Determined. \nWOMAN'S VOICE When I was a little girl, my mother would remind me each night before bed to be sure to open my heart to God, for he was kind, merciful and just. Things changed after my father left a few years later, leaving her to raise me and my brothers alone in a little place out on the edge of the Mojave Desert. She never talked about a kind and merciful God again. Instead she spoke of a prophecy. Of a time when all the world would be covered in darkness and the fate of Mankind would be decided. One night I finally got up the courage to ask my mother why God had changed, why was he mad at his children. \"I don't know,\" she said, tucking the covers around me, \"I guess he just got tired of all the bullshit.\" And with these words the last trace of sunlight is SNUFFED OUT, leaving us in: \nDARKNESS...

Then we notice something moving in the reflection. A dark shape, growing, coming down at us fast. Beat...then WHAM! \nTWO BLACK BOOTS land hard in the water...and we're in: \nEXT. AN ALLEY WAY - LATE NIGHT \nA DARK FIGURE in a tattered trench coat tumbles onto the pavement, hands out to slow the impact. A beat then slowly he climbs to his feet, recovering from what seems to have been quite a fall. He has chiseled features, shaved head, deep-set eyes. Looks like he's been through one hell of a fight. His name, we will come to know, is MICHAEL. He quickly checks out his surroundings, nothing but brick walls above him. Where'd this guy jump from? A RUMBLE of thunder...then RAIN starts to hammer down.   Seems to motivate him. Michael pulls his overcoat tight around his body and dashes toward the mouth of the alley. He reaches the STREET just in time to see a FLEET OF POLICE CARS tearing around the corner, SIRENS WAILING, heading this way. He reels back into the alley way, ducks down behind a trash dumpster, as the BLUE AND RED LIGHTS of the POLICE CARS whip past. Michael waits for the lights to disappear, then he pulls a MASSIVE ORNATE KNIFE from his jacket. Considers it grimly. Runs his finger along its edge. Blood beads up. Razor sharp. Michael begins to peel off his overcoat, revealing his bare chest underneath...and skin literally covered with DARK TATOOS. Hard to see what they are in this light. As his coat falls to the ground, we DRIFT over to the BRICK WALL behind him where we see MICHAEL'S SHADOW crouch over, and then... \n...TWO LARGE SHAPES UNFOLD FROM HIS BACK, STRETCHING UP INTO \nWHAT ARE UNMISTAKABLY...THE SHADOW OF WINGS. The RAIN POUNDS harder, as if punishment from the heavens. The glint of the KNIFE coming down fast. \nA HORRENDOUS SOUND OF FLESH TEARING AWAY FROM BONE... \n...THE BLOODY KNIFE CLATTERING TO THE PAVEMENT... \n...FOLLOWED BY MICHAEL'S UNGODLY SCREAM RISING UP FROM THE ALLEY WAY. And then SILENCE... \nCLOSE ON THE GUTTER, AS BLOOD BEGINS TO FLOW FREELY, MIXING, \nSWIRLING WITH THE RAIN... \nEXT.

Michael drops down through one of the skylights in a shower of glass. \n", "test1_true": "Michael bursts in. Tosses a first-aid kit into the sink. His trench coat falls to the floor and here in the fluorescent light, we get a better look at him. His thin but stunningly well muscled body is TATTOOED shoulder to ankle with INTRICATE WRITING. The man's flesh is a living book. But the writing is in no language we recognize. He turns his back to the mirror, revealing two HORRIFICALLY OPEN WOUNDS running down between both shoulder blades. \nFRESH. BLOODY. He threads a needle not with thread, but with FISHING WIRE, and begins to STITCH the wounds closed. BLOOD POOLS on the cement floor around his feet. \nINT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - MOMENTS LATER \nTrench coat and a shirt back on, Michael races along the ENDLESS RACKS OF GUNS, searching for just the right weapons, his every movement precise, as if he's trained his whole life for this. Weapon after ferocious weapon gets tossed into rifle bags. Whatever this guy's preparing for, it's big. Rifle bags filled, Michael heads for the exit.   Stops cold. The place is locked up tight.   Metal gate over the front doors, bars over the windows.   How the hell's he going to get out of here? \nINT. LAPD SQUAD CAR - DRIVING - SAME \nTwo COPS, world weary, cruise through downtown. That's BURTON behind the wheel, ESTEVEZ riding shotgun. The POLICE RADIO is ABUZZ WITH ACTIVITY.      Busy night. Burton stares out at the city's rain soaked denizens with a deep hatred, the shadows looming in doorways, the streetwalkers. \nBURTON Goddamn' animals. Nights like this I wish I could take a match to this city just so I could watch all these motherfuckers burn. \nESTEVEZ \n(LAUGHS) A good ol' boy barbecue, huh? Burton doesn't even smile.       He's dead fucking serious. \nBURTON A fresh start. That's what this place needs. He holds his finger up like a pistol. Aims it at the people they pass, picking them off one by one. \nBURTON Pow!   Pow!     Pow! Now Burton laughs, a dark, mean laugh.      Estevez eyes his partner, wary. \nESTEVEZ Jesus... You know Burton, I'm so happy we get to share beautiful moments like this. They really brighten my da-- KABOOM! Through the WINDSHIELD, we see a storefront EXPLODE just ahead, raining fiery debris onto the squad car. Burton slams on the breaks and the cops look up just in time to see... \nEXT. GUN & SPORT WORLD - CONTINUOUS \nMichael, bulging rifle bags in each hand, stepping brazenly out of the GAPING HOLE he's blown in the front of the store. \nESTEVEZ (O.S.) Freeze! Estevez and Burton are already out of the squad car, crouching behind the open doors, GUNS trained on Michael. \nESTEVEZ Drop the bags! Hands on your head! In the distance, the POP-POP of GUNFIRE. The POLICE RADIO CRACKLES with URGENT CHATTER. MANY VOICES TALKING AT ONCE. \"Shots fired...Code Three...Officer down!\" The cops shift about nervously, trying to stay focused. \nMICHAEL (sensing their unease:) It's starting. There isn't much time. The cops shoot a quick, anxious glance at each other -- \"what the hell?\" -- then they turn back to Michael. \nBURTON Shut the fuck up and drop the bags now! Michael lets the gun bags hit the ground. \nESTEVEZ Hands on your head!    On your head! Michael slowly places his palms on his skull. \nBURTON Turn around! Turn the fuck around! Michael slowly turns around.    Calm. Estevez rushes in to restrain Michael, grabbing his wrist, FINGERS TIGHTENING. Michael closes his eyes, a terrible decision made. And that's when he moves, a fucking blur! In an instant Michael's broken the cop's arm, spinning him helplessly around, turning him into a human shield. Now it's Michael who's in charge, gun to Estevez's head, facing off with Burton. Burton struggles to find a shot, can't. \nBURTON Let `em go! \nESTEVEZ Take the shot, Burton! \nBURTON I said let `em fuckin' g-g-g-g-- Suddenly Burton starts to SHAKE, the words stuck in his throat like a skipping record. \nESTEVEZ Burton!? THE STREET LAMPS BEGIN TO FLICKER AND STROBE, adding to the confusion. Burton squeezes his eyes shut in pain, his WHOLE BODY QUAKING, heels CLICKING the pavement, as if some massive pressure were building inside him. And with the horrific sound of CRACKING BONES, BURTON'S MOUTH \nBEGINS TO TWIST INTO AN IMPOSSIBLY WIDE SMILE LIKE A BIZARRE \n", "test1_id": 1263, "test2_input": "CLOWN! His eyes SNAP OPEN, focused, the force inside him now fully in control. Burton looks at Michael with calm recognition, his voice GUTTURAL..INHUMAN.

Michael, however, seems to know exactly who he's talking to. \nMICHAEL I'm following my own orders now. \nBURTON Then you will die along with the child. \nESTEVEZ Burton, you fuckin' know this guy?! BLAM! Burton shoots his partner in the head. Estevez drops, leaving Michael without cover. Burton re-aims, but Michael's faster, already FIRING back. Bullets rip up the concrete. SMASH!   The squad car window SHATTERS, Burton's chest EXPLODING! \nAnd down he GOES, leaving Michael the only one left standing. Smoke rising from his gun. With soldier-like efficiency, Michael picks up the rifle bags and begins to load them into the trunk of the squad car. He gets in the car and FLOORS IT, ROARING AWAY, as the FLICKERING STREET LAMPS FINALLY GO OUT IN RAPID SUCCESSION, a wave chasing him, PLUNGING THE ENTIRE CITY INTO DARKNESS... \nSMASH CUT TO: \nJEEP HANSON (LATE TEENS) Bolts awake.   Breathing hard.   Covered with sweat. \nINT. JEEP'S ROOM - JUST BEFORE DAWN \nJeep switches on a lamp, illuminating this incredibly cramped bedroom. Not much larger than the bed itself. He's got shaggy hair, a sensitive face, clearly not big on sunlight. \nEXT. DESERT - PRE-DAWN \nA couple of ancient SILVERSTREAM TRAILERS are bathed in the eerie blue light of night's final moments. It looks like the trailers haven't moved from this patch of barren ground in decades. A single strand of colored Christmas lights dot the trailers roof lines, marking the season. One of the trailer doors CREAKS open and Jeep steps wearily out into the cool western morning. Home. Nothing but desert for miles in all directions, save for a two lane HIGHWAY and a weather beaten TRUCK STOP DINER that Jeep and his father will open for business in a few hours. Jeep gazes up to the diner's slanted roof where a large sign glows like a beacon in the darkness: \n\"PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB\" A beat as Jeep contemplates the sign. \nCHARLIE (O.S.) You okay, Jeep? Jeep turns to see CHARLIE, a very pregnant girl of about twenty, standing in the trailer doorway, rubbing the sleep from her eyes. Even with the trailer-trash veneer, she's strikingly beautiful. \nJEEP Sorry to wake you, Charlie. \nCHARLIE (stepping out of the trailer, hands on her \nBELLY) Wasn't you. He's been kickin' up a storm all night. Must know somethin' I don't. She approaches Jeep.   Sees the strain in his eyes. \nCHARLIE Another bad dream? He struggles for a moment, nods. \nCHARLIE It's just stress, Jeep, that's all. You do too much worryin'. About this place. About your dad. \n(BEAT) About me... A glimmer of a smile crosses Jeep's face. \nJEEP You're the only thing I like worrying about. \nCHARLIE See what I mean? You're worried about a girl eight months pregnant and it isn't even your baby. Now that's enough to give anybody nightmares. Jeep turns away, dejected. \nJEEP Go ahead, make fun of me. Everybody else does. \nCHARLIE (turns him back around) C'mon, I was only kiddin'. You know how much I appreciate everything you and Bob are doing for me, but a month from now, this baby'll have a new family and I'll have to start thinkin' about what the hell I'm doin' with my life. This is not news Jeep wants to hear. \nJEEP So you're still going through with it...? \n", "test2_true": "JEEP I could help you. We could do it together, you know? I want to. Charlie smiles sadly at him, touched by his sweetness, but this just isn't where she's at. \nCHARLIE You gotta stop carryin' the weight of the world on your shoulders. Jeep nods, tries to hide the fact that he's dying inside. \nCHARLIE (rubbing her arms) Now can we go back in? I'm freezing my ass off out here. \nJEEP Go on.   I'll be right there. Charlie kisses him on the cheek and heads back to the trailer. He watches her, longing in his eyes. With the clank of the door, she's gone. And over Jeep's troubled look, the perennial holiday cheer of FRANK CAPRA'S \"IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE\" MIXES up. \nJIMMY STEWART (V.O.) I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel without any wings. \nCUT TO: \nIT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE PLAYING ON A CRUMMY TV Jimmy Stewart as George Bailey has just met Clarence, his guardian angel-in-training. The signal ROLLS and SNOWS in and out. We hear a WHACK, which causes the image to momentarily improve and then slowly roll back the other way. \nCLARENCE (ON TV) Oh, I've got to earn them and you'll help me, won't you? \nINT. PARADISE FALLS GAS `N' GRUB - DAY \nBOB HANSEN (late 40's), owner and proprietor of this fine roadside establishment, attempts to fix the old TV hanging in the corner above the counter by banging the shit out it. The restaurant itself has the kind of grungy diner charm you'd hope to find in a place last renovated in 1963. An old plastic Christmas tree strung with flickering lights and tinsel occupies a lonely corner. Next to that, a faded diorama of the NATIVITY SCENE. The kind you might order off the Shopping Network. Bob considers the TV with a frown. He deftly rolls an ENGRAVED SILVER ZIPPO back and forth over the nicotine stained fingers of his right hand. Must be a nervous habit. You can tell just by looking at the man that he's a beer drinker. Behind the counter, a black man named PERCY WALKER (60's) is cooking up a storm on the grill with spectacular one-handed dexterity. You do get pretty good at this sort of thing when your other hand has long been replaced by a METAL HOOK.   The dog tags around his neck tell the story. His white cook's hat has been temporarily replaced by a red Santa hat. \nPERCY Lord as my witness, Bob, one of these days that thing's gonna hit you back. \nWHACK! \nBOB Whaddya talkin' about, Percy? We got a special relationship here. \nWHACK! \nPERCY Yeah, they got names for that kind a relationship. The JUKEBOX on the other side of the diner starts up with the MERLE HAGGARD tune \"I'M A LONESOME FUGITIVE\". A stunning looking sixteen-year-old GIRL with dyed-black hair and a piercing or three, is leaning seductively over the jukebox, swaying gently to the music. The headband doubling as her mini-skirt reveals her knock-out figure in a way that really doesn't leave much up to the imagination. She's a billboard of rebellion. \nSANDRA (O.S.) It's disgusting. \nHOWARD (O.S.) You're right. It is disgusting. Watching the scintillating action from a booth across the diner is a conservatively dressed SUBURBAN COUPLE. SANDRA and HOWARD ANDERSON. Fish out of water. \nSANDRA Really, how can she go out in public wearing that? \nHOWARD I don't know. Why don't we just ask her? \nSANDRA Howard, don't. You'll embarrass me. \nHOWARD (shouting across the \nDINER) Audrey, honey? Your mother was wondering if you got dressed this morning with the specific intention of showing your ass off to the entire world? The girl who we now know as AUDREY ANDERSON turns to Howard with a caustic smile. \nAUDREY Yeah, that's cuz I woke up hoping to get double teamed by a couple of meth head truckers in the bathroom of some desert shithole. \n(BEAT) Good thing we stopped here. And with that she turns back to the jukebox. Percy watches the exchange discreetly from behind the counter. Loving it. Howard turns back to his wife.   Rigid smile. \nHOWARD I feel satisfied with that answer. I really do. Sandra buries her face in her hands. \n", "test2_id": 1264, "test3_input": "GLADYS Oh, don't worry yourself about that, sweetheart. It'll all be over soon. Sandra nods at the old woman, unsure of what to make of that response. The fly that was circling her head, now lands on GLADYS'S FACE. It crawls across her cheek without her reacting in the least. Howard and Sandra exchange looks.    Creepy. The door JINGLES and Jeep walks in. He heads straight for a quiet huddle with Bob. All the while though, he keeps one eye fixed on the old lady sitting at the table near the Andersons. Something about her... \nJEEP The carburetor's shot.    Don't know why. Looks brand new. \nBOB (glances over at the \nANDERSONS) Ah, shit. They're gonna be pissed. \nJEEP I could try to rebuild it, but it'd take a while, and I don't think we have all the parts. If we call right now, we might be able to get a new one down here tomorrow morning. \nBOB That's not gonna happen.    Goddamn phone's out. \nJEEP What? Across the diner, Charlie places a bloody red steak in front of Gladys. \nGLADYS Thank you, dear. How far along are you? \nCharlie rests a hand on her belly. \nCHARLIE Just about there. \nGLADYS The father must be very proud. \nCHARLIE I wouldn't know. \nGLADYS You mean he's... \nCHARLIE Out of sight. Out of mind. \nGLADYS Oh, I see.     So you're not married, I take it? A fly lands on Gladys's steak. Charlie tries to wave it away. But another one lands in its place. \nCHARLIE Nope. Gladys starts to dig in to the steak with a real ferociousness you wouldn't expect from an old lady.   More FLIES begin to land on her body. On her food. Charlie is still trying to wave them away. \nGLADYS That's too bad. \nCHARLIE No, I prefer it that way. I don't a need a man tellin' me what to do. \nGLADYS But what about the baby? \nCHARLIE I've got it under control. \nGLADYS Yeah, but it's gonna burn. Charlie freezes. The Andersons turn to look as well.   Kyle glances over from the counter. \nCHARLIE What did you just say? \nGLADYS (all smiles) I said your fucking baby's gonna burn. Charlie shakes her head at the woman, not giving in. \nCHARLIE Go to hell, lady. She slaps the check down on the table and walks back toward the kitchen, passing Jeep and Bob. \nBOB What happened? \nCHARLIE Total fucking Jesus freak. Gladys begins to laugh innocently as she continues to devour her meat. Red juice drips down her chin. The flies are swarming now. How did so many get in here? Sandra and Howard are mortified at this sudden turn of events. \n", "test3_true": "SANDRA Gladys, please. There's no reason to -- Gladys's head suddenly whips toward her. \nGLADYS Shut up, you stupid fucking cunt! All you do is complain! Complain! Complain! Sandra covers her mouth in shock.    Everybody in the diner is now focused on the old lady. Howard gets up from the booth. \nSANDRA Howard, it's okay!     Don't listen to her! But Howard's already standing over Gladys. \nHOWARD Who the hell do you think you are, lady?! Now, I'd like you to apologize to my -- \nGLADYS LUNGES AT HOWARD AND TAKES A MONSTROUS BITE OUT OF HIS \nNECK! SHE PULLS BACK TO REVEAL A MOUTH FILLED WITH TINY \nRAZOR SHARP TEETH. EVERYBODY FREAKS as Howard crumbles to the floor. Gladys rockets to her feet, knocking her table over.   Blood covers her face and chest. \nGLADYS You're all going to fucking die! Percy is the first to react. From behind the counter, he whips a heavy metal frying pan at Gladys that knocks her head sideways. THWACK! BONES BREAK AND BURST FROM HER NECK.   Impossibly, Gladys is still standing. She lets out an INHUMAN SCREAM and SCRAMBLES ACROSS THE DINER, knocking tables and chairs over in her wake. Bob pulls a shotgun from behind the counter. \nBOB Don't move! But Gladys not only moves, SHE SCURRIES RIGHT UP THE FUCKING \nWALL LIKE SOME KIND OF BIZARRE CRAB! Bob can't believe his eyes. But he gets over it real fast, as the crab lady rushes toward him -- ACROSS THE CEILING -- \nUPSIDE DOWN! BOB PUMPS THE SHOTGUN, trying to take her down, but he can't track her fast enough. Instead he blows ENORMOUS HOLES in the ceiling, a rain of plaster. Gladys drops down right in front of Bob. \nBOB (struggles to cock the \nGUN) Fuck! Gladys smiles sweetly before SLAPPING HIM CLEAR ACROSS THE \nROOM! The shotgun clatters to the floor at Jeep's feet. He snatches it up and aims it at Gladys who turns calmly to face him. \nPERCY Shoot her, Jeep! Jeep's about to fire, when the old lady's EYES GO ALL WHITE. \nGLADYS (a sickly sweet smile) You'll never save her. Jeep freezes, stunned by her words, overwhelming fear paralyzing him where he stands. \nPERCY \nSHOOT THE FUCKING BITCH! Gladys rockets straight at him! But Jeep's too afraid to move.    He clamps his eyes shut, bracing himself for the end. \nBLAM!   BLAM!   BLAM! A RAIN OF BULLETS RIP INTO GLADYS, taking her down like an animal. Jeep slowly opens his eyes.   His gun's still cocked. Gladys lies dead in a smoldering, bloody heap at his feet. He turns to see Kyle with smoke rising from the barrel of his silver plated WESTERN ARMS 45. If everyone wasn't so shocked, they'd probably be wondering why this guy is packing such serious heat. \nSANDRA (O.S.) Somebody help me! Sandra is on the floor with her husband.     Blood pours freely from his neck. Kyle stares at the dying man -- a moment of hesitation -- then he rushes to help. \nKYLE Press your hands over the hole! Sandra looks fearfully up at Kyle, at the gun still in his hand. \nKYLE Don't look at me like that, lady! I'm tryin' to fuckin' help you! Now put your goddamn hands over the hole before your husband bleeds to death! Obeying, she cups her hands over the hole in his neck, desperately trying to stop the flow of blood leaking out between her fingers. Percy scrambles over with a first-aid kit and together he and Kyle get to work on Howard's neck. \nA few feet away, Charlie helps Bob, bruised and bleeding, to his feet. \nBOB The fuck was that?!   What the fuck was that!? Across the diner, Audrey is pushed back into a booth, her knees pulled tightly to her chest, shivering. Her adult facade giving way to that of a frightened child A DROP OF RED HITS AUDREY'S CHEEK, causing her to look up and see Gladys's TRAIL OF BLOOD DRIPPING FROM THE CEILING. An ungodly horror. \nEXT. PARADISE FALLS GAS 'N' GRUB - SAME \n", "test3_id": 1265}

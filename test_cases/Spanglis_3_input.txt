Flor..what I walk on? 
MONICA AND EVELYN 
Florrrrr. 
FLOR 
Florrrrr. 
BERNICE 
It means flower, right? 
MONICA 
Yes. Flower. Florrrrr. 
EVELYN 
Florrrrr. 
FLOR 
Florrrrr. Deborah is beginning to feel criticized...she takes a beat..eyes everyone with some hostility. 
DEBORAH 
(directly to Flor) Is there some school of the ear I'm flunking out of right now? Flor says to Monica, in Spanish, a tip to pronounce her name. Monica warns Flor to leave it rest..since Deborah is becoming clearly and strangely pissed.. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
What did she say? 
CLOSE ON FLOR... 
She feels the tension but, so far in her life, her own irrepressible personality has served her - so she moves forward with surprising and quiet confidence and assurance. She tells her aunt to repeat her words so that now, for the first time, she is, through Monica, talking directly to Deborah. 
MONICA 
(translating) She says..If you curl your tongue and let it be loose you will have it..that it's hard for Americans.. She says it's great that you try so hard. Many people wouldn't bother. 
DEBORAH 
(an emotional pronouncement/her greatest accolade) She gets me.... She smiles at Flor, who returns the smile. 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
You want some lemonade? Take some lemonade. She pours some for Flor and Monica. Then she closes her eyes and pauses in utter dedication to a final effort: 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
Florrrrr. It is perfect..Flor grins at Deborah's victory...claps her hands together. 
FLOR 
(a Spanish word) Sublime. Deborah feels relief..free for a moment from the dark corridors of self-criticism..She is lighter, prettier, innocent..Wholly and completely attractive. 
DEBORAH 
Whew, dense but stubborn, right? Thanks. (an important declaration) What you just did with me is just what kids need..patience and encouragement. Alright, money... Bernice rises like a shot to take off.. 
BERNICE 
Goodbye, really.. (to Flor) Look forward to seeing you. As she leaves. 
DEBORAH 
(absently to Bernie) Love you... (then with not a monoseconds break) ... the job is six days a week, seven to seven..the kids and all housekeeping, how much a week would you like? Monica translates..Flor, embarrassed a bit by the directness, ducks the question..saying in Spanish -- "whatever you say.." 
DEBORAH (CONT'D) 
No.. This is an important question..if you ask for too little it means you don't value 
yourself..too much and you're taking advantage. (after Monica translates) So? Flor is dumbstruck by the challenge of this pop quiz but not without some native wit and style to maneuver around it. 
FLOR 
(extremely heavy accent) One thousand dollars. Deborah falls for it until Flor laughs..others join...Deborah now a big smile, snort of a laugh, putting her hand to her face and shaking her head. 
OTHER ANGLE.. 
As Monica uses Deborah's reaction time to, in mid-laugh, flash four fingers to Flor.. 
ON EVELYN. 
Catching the gesture and secretly indicating to Monica they should go for six. 
MONICA 
(firmly) Six hundred dollars. Flor shoots her a look of fear...a tense beat. 
DEBORAH 
Welcome to the family.. Deborah kisses her..sort of on the mouth. In the midst of Flor's delight she is thrown by Deborah's kiss...it is the first of many borders to be violated. 
31   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - DAY.                                     31 
As Flor and Monica exit and can finally show their full joy. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
32   EXT. STONE CANYON - EVENING.                                 32 
JOHN CLASKY driving a smallish SUV. He is an upbeat, talented, successful man with an ego as balanced as a high- end watch; who loves his wife, kids and job. In other words, watch out, John. 
33   EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 33 
As John pulls into the driveway next to a catering truck and exits his SUV carrying a large wrapped tray.. 
34   INT. CLASKY HOUSE - EVENING.                                 34 
As John moves quickly through the downstairs, he puts the tray on a counter where food servers are working. 
JOHN 
I brought some dessert. As he moves on, we see in the background the workers unwrap and react to a fantastic concoction. A caterer (who we may notice looks at him like royalty) falls in beside him and whispers to him. 
CATERER 
She came down to check on the party and realized the gardeners hadn't finished rolling the sod. 
35   INT. / EXT. CLASKY HOUSE - BACKYARD - NIGHT                  35 
JOHN'S POV - DEBORAH AND TWO FEMALE CATERERS.

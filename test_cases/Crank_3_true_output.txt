CHEV GETTING KILLED, YOU IDIOT! 
KAYLO What? 
HEV What? What? You heard me.      That son of a bitch Ricky Verona. 
AYLO Ricky Verona ... 
CHEV (more to himself) Who would've thought that little bastard had the stones to come whack me in my own crib... it's inconceivable... and yet, here we are. 
KAYLO Where are we? 
Silence.

CONTINUED: 
CHEV I'm dead and you're simple. Now listen: you put the word out I'm looking for Ricky Verona. Anyone sees him you call me. 
KAYLO puts his hands up in the air, dumbfounded. 
CHEV (CONT'D) I'm going to get that little son of a bitch if it's the last thing I do... it may actually be the last thing I do, understand that? Copy me on that? 
KAYLO Ricky Verona? 
CHEV Find him! 
Arriving at his destination CHEV clicks off, simultaneously closing KAYLO'S SCREEN IN A SCREEN, and shoves the phone into his shirt pocket as he screeches up the sidewalk. 
CUT TO: 
19   A                                                                19 EXT STREET, NEAR BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, MOMENTS LATER 
run down street in Inglewood. The BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE is a low lying pool hall/bar with a crude hand-painted sign reading BEER POOL DARTS. Motorcycles are parked out front. 
OLLER DOLLY from alongside CHEV'S car at high speed, break off and follow inside as CHEV parks haphazardly, rushes out and busts into the joint ... 
INT. BLACK SABBATH CLUBHOUSE, CONTINUOUS The continuous ROLLER DOLLY move takes us inside and KEEPS GOING. Eight or ten BROTHERS, some wearing motorcycle leathers, are scattered around the room, shooting stick, drinking, etc. CHEV BARGES IN, drawing a GLOK .45 from his coat and goes straight at ORLANDO - black, hip, 30's, better dressed than the others - who is at the center of a group of BADASSES. 
efore anyone has time to react CHEV has the GUN PRESSED INTO ORLANDO'S FOREHEAD and is pushing him through the place into the bathroom. Everyone scatters and takes cover at the site of the GLOK; firearms appear.

CONTINUED: 
CHEV locks the door, SLAMS ORLANDO against the far wall and starts circling around him with the gun beaded on ORLANDO'S forehead. 
CHEV (out of his mind) Where's Verona!! 
ORLANDO (flipping out) It's cool it's cool it's cool! 
CHEV Talk!! 
CHEV cocks the gun. 
ORLANDO I'm talking! What are we talking about? 
CHEV Don't fuck with me!! 
ORLANDO OK, nobody's fucking with you, just calm down ... 
CHEV DON'T TELL ME TO CALM DOWN MOTHERFUCKER! 
There's BANGING on the door.    A BIKER yells from outside. 
BIKER (O.S.) O-land-o! What's up! 
ORLANDO (calling back) There's a white man with a gun in here, I would prefer that he not cap my ass, so please refrain from any sudden ass bullshit! to CHEV) Now you see that? I'm trying to help you here. 
HEV starts to chill out. 
CHEV Look, I got to find Ricky Verona ... 
ORLANDO Why would I know where ... ?

DANA Well it came out a little mean Helen. 
HELEN Dana who's side are you on? All the girls start yelling. Helen loses control of the car for a split second and drives off the road hitting something. BOOM! The girls scream!!! She pulls over. All the girls are wide eyed and speechless. 
BECCA What was that? 
DANA Did we hit something!? 
HELEN Was it a person? 
ANNIE Guys it's just a flat. I've gotten tons of them. Annie goes to get out of the car. 
BECCA/DANA No!/ Annie don't get out!/ It's pitch dark out. 
HELEN Everybody calm down. I'm calling 911. 
LESLIE You don't call 911 for a flat tire! A huge truck drives by moving their car a little bit. The girls SCREAM! 
ANNIE Guys! We're fine. Helen, put the hazards on. Helen puts them on. 
LESLIE I'm calling AAA. 
BECCA I'm calling Kevin! 
ANNIE Helen, do you have a jack? 
HELEN Probably?! 
DANA What if we get hit just sitting here? Or kidnapped or chased by an animal? 
ANNIE Dana calm down. 
LESLIE Shit! I don't have any service. 
BECCA Me neither! 
DANA Oh my God! We're gonna die... Annie has had enough and gets out. The tire is definitely flat. She opens Hele's trunk, lifts the bottom (wherever the jack is in an Escalade] She goes up to the window. 
INT. HELEN'S ESCALADE. CONTINUOUS. 
ANNIE Everyone's gotta get out, if you want me to fix this. They complain that its dangerous, i's cold, but they do. Annie puts the jack under car. 
LESLIE So, how can I help? 
ANNIE Hold the flashlight. Leslie and Megan watch as Annie pumps the jack. She really does know what she's doing! The car is raising. 
ANNIE (CONT'D) Megan hand me the wrench. Megan hands it to her. Annie starts to unscrew the lug nuts handing them to Megan, with Leslie by her side. Dana and Becca stand with Helen. 
DANA That's pretty cool she knows how to do change a tire. 
BECCA I know. I can't believe she's doing it. Dana and Becca move over to Annie. Helen waits alone. 
HELEN Just don't scratch anything. The girls are all crouched down to watch Annie in awe. 
DANA So what are you doing now? 
ANNIE I'm removing the lug nuts so we can take the tire off. 
BECCA How does that little thing lift the whole car? 
MEGAN It uses hydraulic power. It gives a human being the lifting capacity of 1.5 to three tons. 
LESLIE How do you know this stuff? 
MEGAN I like cars. There's a real artistry to them. 
HELEN Are you guys working or talking? We do't have all night. 
DANA (quickly) Annie is doing the best she can Helen. So why don't you just stand over there and be quiet and wait. 
Everyone's speechless. 
HELEN Excuse me?! Dana stands. She has had it with Helen. 
DANA I said, will you, for once, shut the fuck up!!!?? Dana approaches Helen. The other girls are standing now. 
DANA (CONT'D) Lillian probably left because of you anyway. 
HELEN What!? 
DANA You're so- bossy! You've been acting like you're in charge this whole time! Do't you realize how much pressure sh's under? You know, Lillian did not want to leave her reception in a unicorn-drawn carriage?! She said âThat's not me.â And you ordered it anyway! You've been pushing her this whole time! Annie was right.

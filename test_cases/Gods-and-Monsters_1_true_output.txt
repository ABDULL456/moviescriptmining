Whale stops.  He lets out a bitter laugh. 
WHALE I'm sorry.  I've just realized how terribly ironic it all is. 
CLAY What? 
WHALE I've spent most of my life outrunning my past.  Now it's flooding all over me. 
Clay stares out blankly. 
WHALE There's something about the openness of your face that makes me want to speak the truth.  Yes, my family ate dripping.  Beef dripping and four to a bed, and a privy out back in the alley.  Are you also from the slums, Mr. Boone? 
CLAY We weren't rich.  But we weren't poor either. 
WHALE No, you were middle class, like all Americans. 
CLAY I guess you'd say we lived on the wrong side of the tracks. 
WHALE In Dudley there were more sides of the tracks than any American can imagine.  Every Englishman knows his place.  And if you forget, there's always someone to remind you.  My family had no doubts about who they were.  But I was an aberration in that household a freak of nature.  I had imagination, cleverness, joy.  Where did I get that?  Certainly not from them. 
Whale's voice has changed, becoming more pinched and nasal. 
WHALE They took me out of school when I was fourteen and put me in a factory.  They meant no harm.  They were like a family of farmers who've been given a giraffe, and don't know what to do with the creature except harness him to the plow. 
Whale seems completely lost in the past by now. 
WHALE Hatred was the only thing that kept my soul alive in that soul-killing place.  And among those men I hated was my own poor, dumb father.  Who put me in that hell to begin with. 
Whale peers out from behind the square of paper.  He pales when he sees his father William, his face covered with grime, glaring at him from across the room.  Whale retreats behind the pad, takes a breath. 
CLAY (O.S.) Mr. Whale? 
Relief floods Whale's face.  He looks out, smiles at Clay. 
WHALE You have to excuse me, Mr. Boone. Since my stroke, I am often overcome with nostalgia. 
CLAY I don't mind.  I'm not crazy about my old man either. 
Whale rubs a hand across his eyes and steps into the open. 
WHALE Why don't we break for five minutes?  You probably want to stretch your legs. 
Whale pulls the cover sheet over the pad to hide what he's drawn so far. 
DWIGHT (V.O.) So you just sat there while this old limey banged his gums? 
INT. HARRY'S BEACHCOMBER - NIGHT 
The place is dead.  There's only Clay and Dwight sitting at the bar with the owner, HARRY, a balding hep cat with a scraggly tuft of beard.  And, in a booth, KID SAYLOR, a cocky 20-year-old, necking with a pony-tailed TEENAGER. 
CLAY I liked it.  You learn stuff listening to old-timers. 
DWIGHT (to Harry) You ever hear of this Whale fellow? 
HARRY Can't say that I have.  Can't say I've heard of a lot of people though. 
CLAY If you don't believe me, let's watch this movie.  See if his name's on it.  How about it, Harry? Can I watch my damn movie? 
HARRY I told you.  I don't turn on the TV except for the fights. 
BETTY CARTWRIGHT appears behind the bar, lugging a bucket of ice from the storeroom.  She's an attractive woman in her early 30s, big-boned and almost as tall as Clay. 
BETTY A spooky movie.  Just what this place needs tonight. 
DWIGHT Couldn't make it any deader, doll. Set me up. 
BETTY Sure.  Your friend want one? 
Clay reacts to the silent treatment with a tight smile. 
DWIGHT Yeah, one for what's-his-name here. 
She sets down two bottles of Pabst without looking at Clay. 
CLAY Thanks, doll. 
BETTY (to Harry) I say let loverboy watch his movie.  And be grateful Boone's not cutting Shirley Temple's lawn. 
CLAY Why is everybody giving me crap tonight? 
DWIGHT Jesus, Boone.  You come in here proud as a peacock because some old coot wants to paint your picture. We're just bringing you back to earth. 
BETTY Sounds screwy to me.  I can't imagine a real artist wanting to spend time looking at that kisser.

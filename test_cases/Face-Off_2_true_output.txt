Chaos.  A bodyguard is mowed down.  Dietrich and the others scatter and hit the floor. 
KITCHEN 
Cindee and Fitch are caught in flagrante delicto on the floor as the kitchen is decimated by GUNFIRE... 
SASHA'S BEDROOM 
Coughing, Archer crawls through the roiling smoke toward the door.  He's almost out when... 
SASHA Adam! 
Her wail of fear freezes Archer.  He looks back -- and sees Adam in the eye of the firestorm. 
Archer's face betrays his conflict.  A child -- but his worst enemy's child. 
BULLETS SHRED the WALL around Adam.  Getting closer. 
Archer moves -- he crawls toward Adam. 
Just then -- a SWAT agent rappels in through one of the shattered windows, his weapon poised.  Archer kicks him hard, pitching him back through the window. 
Archer grabs Adam -- curling him into his body.  Thinking fast, he soaks his discarded T-shirt into a toppled flower vase -- then places it over Adam's face. Protecting him. 
He rushes to Sasha.  Together, they barrel through the soft, paper wall and tear out an escape route. 
INT. KITCHEN 
FIRING out the window, Fitch is riddled from outside by an agent as he CRASHES through the WINDOW. 
Cindee slashes the agent with a cleaver.  He FIRES -- BLASTING Cindee into the refrigerator. 
LOWER LEVEL 
Archer hustles Sasha and Adam toward the staircase when -- 
FRONT DOOR 
explodes open.  SWAT agents swarm to get in -- FIRING and throwing FLASH-GRENADES. 
ARCHER, SASHA AND ADAM 
are caught out in the open, when -- 
UPPER LEVEL 
Dietrich, et al, open FIRE down on the attacking agents. Agents drop or are driven back out. 
SKYLIGHT 
BURSTS open and agents rappel down -- FIRING.  Aldo's bodyguard falls, riddled, off the upper level. 
LOWER LEVEL 
as one agent lands, Archer knocks his gun to the floor. They grapple.  As the agent reaches for it -- Adam appears and kicks the gun away.  Just like Mommy. 
SASHA 
scoops up the kicked weapon -- and cold-cocks another rappelling agent.  Then she FIRES, cutting a third rappelling agent's rope.  he drops hard to the floor -- unconscious. 
Still grappling, Archer rips off the agent's gas-mask... 
ARCHER Buzz... 
Buzz's eyes reveal only hatred.  He reaches for his knife.  Archer hesitates, then heaves Buzz through the glass door.  He pushes Adam upstairs as more agents pour in the front door. 
ARCHER Dietrich!  The painting! 
UPPER LEVEL 
Dietrich sees the canvas mural above the breached front door -- and understands.  He opens FIRE, cutting loose the mural.  It collapses, billowing -- and enshrouds the attacking agents -- and buying time. 
DIETRICH Let's go! 
Archer and Sasha flee up the stairs. 
UPPER LEVEL 
Sasha sees Adam huddled in the middle of the glass floor -- the shadows of agents moving below. 
SASHA Adam! 
LOWER LEVEL 
An agent aims his shotgun at the glass floor -- at the "target" kneeling on top of it. 
UPPER LEVEL 
Archer dives and grabs the boy as the GLASS FLOOR EXPLODES up.  He rolls through a shower of glass -- but comes up with Adam safely.

Medium shot taken from outside the terrace, of Edward standing near the balustrade. His vest is open and he has taken his tie off. He tries to look over the balustrade, but can't. 
LYRICS It must have been love, But it's over now. It must have been good... 
He walks away from the balustrade, and back into the penthouse. 
LYRICS ...But I lost it somehow. It must have been love, But it's over now. 
The camera lets Edward go inside the penthouse and pans to the right along the wall and the foliage decorating the terrace.

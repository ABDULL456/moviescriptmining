SEBASTIAN Good for you. 
KEITH ...Looking for keys. 
SEBASTIAN (after a beat) I'm good. 
KEITH You sure? It pays. 
Sebastian looks at Keith. A moment. 
SEBASTIAN I'm good. 
Keith almost smiles. Expected this. 
KEITH Let's just grab a drink then. Call me. It's been too long. 
SEBASTIAN You bet. 
KEITH Nice meeting you, Mia. Revision                           42. 
MIA Nice meeting you. 
Keith walks off. Mia and Sebastian look at each other. Then -- 
71   INT. SEBASTIAN'S APARTMENT - NIGHT 
CLOSE ON MIA. She looks anxious. CLOSE ON Sebastian. He looks head-over-heels in love. 
SEBASTIAN It's beautiful. 
MIA ...You're just saying that. 
SEBASTIAN No... I'm not. 
We PULL BACK -- and see a script on Mia's lap. She's just finished reading Sebastian her play. 
MIA I don't know... Is the whole thing too nostalgic? 
SEBASTIAN That's the point. 
MIA But do you think people will like it? 
SEBASTIAN Fuck `em. 
MIA (laughs) You always say that. 
SEBASTIAN I truly believe it. 
MIA Fine -- as long as you sit front-row `cause I'll probably throw up on the middle of the stage otherwise. 
SEBASTIAN I'll be front-row. 
Mia looks at him. Smiles. It genuinely means the world to her. Then, a glow in her eyes, wants to reciprocate -- Revision                       43. 
MIA I made something for you. 
She hops off the bed, fishes through a bag. Pulls out a drawing. 
SEBASTIAN What's that? 
MIA It could be the name design. On the door. 
SEBASTIAN Why does it say "Seb's"? 
MIA That's what you should name it. 
SEBASTIAN Never. 
MIA Sebastian, no one's going to a club called "Chicken on a Stick".

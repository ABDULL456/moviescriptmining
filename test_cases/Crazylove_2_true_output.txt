MRS. HALLSTROM Don't worry, Doctor, I didn't forget you. 
Mrs. Hallstrom hands Dr. Emlee a fake ruby hair comb. 
DR. EMLEE Mrs. Hallstrom, you can't possibly afford to pay for this. It must go back. 
Chatter in the hallway stops. 
MRS. HALLSTROM Why, no, Doctor. It can't. Most of it's for my daughter, Lily. She's coming to family day tomorrow...all the way from Cleveland with my grandson. (beat) You can't be taking away their "Welcome to California" presents. 
DR. EMLEE It's going back. We'll contact the company this afternoon. (to patients) Take the jewelry off, please. 
M The patients reluctantly remove their gifts. 
RS. HALLSTROM But I have to keep something for my daughter. 
DR. EMLEE Let's go back to group, and discuss it there. Back to group, everyone. 
The patients head back to group.   Dr. Emlee turns to Nurse Gates. 
DR. EMLEE (to Nurse Gates) Increase her lithium to 600 milligrams, three times a day. Oh, and Nurse, let's see about canceling the cable. 
EXT. PATIO - HILLVIEW PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL - DAY 
The place buzzes with festivity. A "WELCOME FAMILIES" sign hangs from a patio beam. A table is laden with cookies and lemonade and platter after platter of carrot curls. 
Letty takes a cookie and looks toward the lawn where Michael plays frisbee with his family, even his grandmother, ROSA. Nurse Gates walks up to Letty. 
NURSE GATES Your mother's in the rec room, Letty. 
INT. REC ROOM - SAME 
Letty passes Mrs. Hallstrom, who sits by herself, holding one small gift on her lap. 
Letty spots her Mom across the room, and walks up to her. Her mother has covered a table with swatches of fabric. 
MRS. MAYER It's so good to see you, Sweetheart. 
LETTY You too, Mom. 
MRS. MAYER You're looking good.    A little thin, but good. 
Letty examines a fabric sample. 
MRS. MAYER Thanks so much for doing this. Ruthie and Jake are up to a million things. And I just can't decide. 
Letty rearranges the fabric samples on the table by color. 
LETTY Which flowers did you order? 
MRS. MAYER We haven't. I wanted to talk that over with you, too. 
LETTY Oh, OK, well, better to choose the table cloths first anyway. 
MRS. MAYER I was thinking either the peach moire or cream damask. 
Letty holds up a swatch of bright yellow. 
LETTY This would complement the blue in the bride's maids' dresses. Look. 
MRS. MAYER Where's your ring, Sweetheart? 
LETTY We aren't allowed to wear jewelry in here, Mom. 
MRS. MAYER Just think, pretty soon, we'll be doing all these wedding preparations for you. (beat) Of course, if that's what you still want. Ruthie told me some silly story about a crush on some boy here. 
Letty pulls out a cigarette, lights it and starts smoking. 
LETTY I haven't had a crush since I was 
MRS. MAYER When did you start smoking? 
LETTY I'll put it out if it bothers you. 
MRS. MAYER The puckering, dear. It doesn't seem so now, but in time, it will cause wrinkles around the mouth. 
Letty grinds the cigarette beneath her heel.    She bends over the fabrics. 
MRS. MAYER You know, your life isn't about being in a mental hospital. 
LETTY What? 
MRS. MAYER I hear this Michael fellow is schizophrenic. 
LETTY Mom, please. 
MRS. MAYER Don't forget that Paul's a promising young attorney who loves you very much... 
LETTY Mom, look, if I want to dump Paul, I'll dump him. If I want to screw Michael or live with him or marry him, then I'll do that.

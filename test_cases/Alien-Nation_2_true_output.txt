SYKES (wearily) Watson... this is my partner here's first coupla days, and he wants to make a good impression.  Me, though, the way I feel -- this could be my last day, know what I mean?  And I'm ready to rain on you like a cow pissin' on a flat rock. 
WATSON Look -- Mr. Strader hasn't been around for a coupla days.  He didn't tell me where he was going or when he'd be back.  I swear it. 
SYKES (to Jetson) What do you think? 
JETSON I believe he is probably lying. 
SYKES Through his ass. (to Watson) Next time you see him, tell him to call me... unless you want us to keep coming back on you like a bad case of herpes. 
Sykes shoves a business card in Watson's breast pocket. They walk away and Watson slumps against his car. 
ANGLE - MOVING WITH SYKES AND JETSON 
as they walk wearily to the slug-mobile. 
SYKES George, you can handle the women from now on, you mind? 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  ENCOUNTERS PARKING LOT - NIGHT 
Watson is alone, surveying the damage to his Alfa, when he hears footsteps.  He turns with a "What now?" expression and -- a shotgun butt is slammed into his forehead.  He goes down.  Kipling stands over him, flanked by FOUR HUMAN THUGS.  One of these is QUINT, senior human in Harcourt's employ. 
QUINT (to other Thugs) Okay, scrape him up. 
CUT TO: 
EXT.  ZUMA BEACH APPROACH _ NIGHT 
Harcourt's private limo glides down the narrow access road, passing a lookout car attended by two alien Thugs. The limo moves down to the beach, parking near an n.d. van. 
Harcourt exits the limo, walks onto the sand to the back of the van.  Here he finds Kipling and Quint and the three human Thugs. 
They have Watson chained to the van's rear bumper, facing the sea, and have been working him over with a tire iron. He's bruised and bloody, but still conscious. 
HARCOURT Any progress? 
QUINT My arm's gettin' tired and so far, zip. 
KIPLING He is ss'verdlatya ss'alo to Strader. 
QUINT What's that mean? 
KIPLING Duty-bonded.  His allegiance to Strader is above pain or life. 
QUINT You tellin' me this guy would die before he'd screw his boss and work for us?  Nobody's that dumb. 
KIPLING It is something you couldn't comprehend, Quint. 
Harcourt approaches Watson, kneels beside him, careful to keep the knee of his designer pants out of the sand. 
HARCOURT I understand you have been resisting my offer Mr. Watson.  Your sense of duty to Mr. Strader is noble, but -- no longer an issue, I'm afraid... 
Harcourt signals and the two Thugs drag an alien body from the back if the van: a middle-aged alien, Strader, shot twice through the front of his silk suit.  Watson's eyes widen in fear. 
HARCOURT (continuing) I will not make this offer again.  I want you to work for me, to manage the nightclub as Strader's successor. If you do, you will know a wealth and comfort our people never dared imagine... 
Watson stares at Harcourt, scared but defiant. 
WATSON Sss'k'a ta'! 
Harcourt studies Watson a moment, perhaps even admiring his resolve.  Then-- 
HARCOURT It is such a pity to die for an outmoded value. (rising) Mr. Quint, I believe it's time for our friend's swimming lesson. 
Watson freaks out, howling and lashing against the chains. 
HARCOURT (to Watson) It's important to learn new skills. Essential to your growth as a person.

JOEL Yes. 
DEAN Wow. Man, that really goes to show you -- this town is smaller than you think. You really gotta be careful. Joel hangs up and walks out of his office, past his Secretary. 
JOEL I'm not feeling well. I'm going to go home early. 
INT. JOEL'S CAR -- DAY 
Joel turns the corner to his house and does a double-take as he sees BRAD'S TRUCK going the opposite direction. 
JOEL Shit! Joel slams on the brakes, turns around, chases Brad's truck down and cuts him off, forcing him to stop. They both get out of their vehicles. Joel is livid. 
JOEL What the hell were you doing on my street again?! 
BRAD Dude, you weren't supposed to be home for another four hours-- Whoa, what happened to your face? 
JOEL (trying to improvise a tough, snappy comeback, but can't quite make it 
WORK) 
(MORE) 
JOEL (CONT'D) The same thing that's gonna happen.. Your face is gonna look worse if... GOD DAMMIT! If I ever catch you anywhere near my house or my wife again, I'll have you arrested. 
BRAD For what? Suzie let me in. Joel is stumped -- Brad actually has a point. 
JOEL What the hell is wrong with you anyway? Do you do this with all your clients -- just keep coming back and hanging around? 
BRAD I don't know. This is my first one. 
JOEL What?! I thought you were a professional! 
BRAD Look man, I know she's your wife an' shit, but you might as well know -- I think we're in love. 
JOEL In love?! 
(COMING UNGLUED) HA! Man are you stupid. You are so goddamn dumb. You think she loves you? You're nothing but a piece of ass to her. That's all. 
BRAD I don't think so dude. 
JOEL Oh, you don't think so "dude?" Well did you ever think about this: she doesn't even know that I paid you to have sex with her -- did that cross your small mind? 
BRAD Uuh.. 
JOEL How about I go home right now and tell her? Tell her you did it for the money. How about that loverboy? Brad suddenly looks worried. This really freaks him out. 
BRAD You wouldn't do that. 
JOEL You don't think so? Watch me. 
BRAD (realizing he's serious) No... Dude, please don't. Please? Joel starts back to his car. 
BRAD Look man, we really have a special thing going on. Please don't mess it up... Joel stops. 
JOEL Don't mess it up?! You're talking about my wife! My house! Stupid- ass! Joel gets in his car and starts it. 
BRAD (calls out to him) Dude, you can't do this to me. 
JOEL Oh yes I can... Joel peels out, drives half a block and turns into his driveway.

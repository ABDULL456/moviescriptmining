He postures proudly, all puffed out. Eva looks at him helplessly. And he paternally encourages her to explain. 
EVA Well... okay. The five of us -- Elspeth, Jezebel, Athena, Raven and me -- are a coven. 
TED Ha, like a coven of witches? 
EVA Yes. 
TED (stunned) Oh. 
He looks around the room: QUICK CUTS of candles, iconography, jars of lurid substances, unknown body parts of animals woven into the nature sculpture... and are those tongues in that can? Ted's getting the creeps, but again puffs himself up. 
TED I knew that! 
EVA (getting calmer) And you see, our coven has spent forty years trying to perfect a ritual to undo a wicked curse put on our goddess Diana. 
TED Gee, you don't look a day over twenty! 
EVA Oh... ha ha... I mean the witches before us tried and failed. But Athena, our High Priestess, discovered a great potion to reverse the evil spell which turned our beautiful goddess into an old rock. 
TED (looking at the rock) Yeah? Is... is that her? 
Eva nods, looking lovingly at the stone. 
EVA She was a beautiful virgin. An entertainer by trade, but a great sorceress by design. It was here in this very room, on her wedding night, a jealous rival placed the curse on Diana. 
TED She turned to -- that -- here? 
EVA Yes... and her young husband turned into a pink fish! They found him swimming in the pool in circles. While our dear goddess: a stone in her honeymoon bed. 
Ted frowns as he ponders all this. Eva takes a photo from the altar and hands it to Ted. 
EVA This was Diana. 
CLOSE ON photo: a Blond Bombshell in full-on Betty Page attire, a bare-tittied pinup girl, playfully spanking a girl in bondage with a spiked high heel. 
TED This girl here? This is the goddess Diana? 
The photograph slowly comes alive. Diana stops spanking the girl and unties her. 
She pulls the girl (in the black satin mask) up off her lap and makes the girl stand. The women face each other and break into a cheek-to-cheek tango. 
CLOSE ON Ted as he shakes his head. Are his eyes playing tricks on him? 
TED I hate to tell you this, but I kinda doubt she was a virgin. 
EVA Oh, but she was! She had lovers, but she saved that for marriage. Which is the example I've tried to follow: to do everything but that till I marry... 
She begins to sob again. Ted comforts her. 
TED Hey, don't cry... a virgin is a rare and beautiful thing. If you say she was a virgin, I'll believe it. 
EVA Well, it doesn't matter now... and she won't be resurrected tonight 'cause I failed her. I let my whole coven down! 
TED Wait a sec -- that rock was gonna turn back into this? 
He holds up the photo. Eva nods. 
TED Now, that would be something worth seeing! 
EVA Only, not now -- we were each supposed to bring something -- a life fluid. 
TED (wincing in disgust) If this is gonna be like one of those afterbirth conversations, I don't think I wanna hear this. 
EVA Only... I swallowed it... 
TED You swallowed what? 
Eva looks off. Ted searches his brains, thoroughly sickened now. 
TED You mean, you were supposed to bring... like... like a guy's... and you...? 
She nods; he winces, queasy. Eva looks at him, helpless. 
EVA And now, you're my last chance! 
TED (laughing) Yeah, sure. (then -- panic) Whoa, what? You want my -- for the -- witchy poo -- ahh no -- no way -- nope. Besides, it's against hotel policy. I was warned: "No sex with the clientele"! 
Eva sobs, pleading. She throws off her shawl, baring her lovely breasts, and reaches her arms around his neck. He keeps backing off. Unbeknownst to him, he is already doing a ritualistic shuffle. 
TED Ha, c'mon now, joke's over. (seeing this is no joke) Hey, we're gonna step in the flea powder.

BETH (shaking her head) I can't. (after a beat, admitting her feelings) He gets to me... too much. If I don't go I'll end up with staying with him. 
CAROL (gently) You've done worse. 
BETH Sure. 
They look at each other and start to laugh. Their laughter builds -- a release of the strain of the last two days. 
CUT TO: 
INT. NICK'S SEDAN - INTERSTATE - DAY 
Nick's driving fast, completely focused on the road ahead, the wind ROARING through the open windows. 
A cheap plastic Indian headdress with brightly colored synthetic feathers is perched on his head. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BEDROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Sid's finished painting -- the room gleams. He pulls a dropcloth off the bureau, then another one off of Beth's two packed suitcases. 
BETH (O.S.) (softly) Sid? 
Sid turns and looks, smiling. 
SID'S POV 
Beth is standing in the doorway, a weariness having settled over her. She steps into the room. 
BETH AND SID 
SID Hi. 
BETH I'm sorry about selling the sofa bed. 
SID I didn't really need one. When my friends get drunk, they throw up and sleep on the floor. 
BETH But I gave it to you. 
He puts his arms around her. 
SID You gave me a lot more. 
BETH No. (holding him tightly) It was all even in this department. 
SID (softly) ...Feel me? 
BETH (whispering) I know... You're hard again. 
Holding her tightly, Sid runs his fingers down her spine. 
SID I want you all the time. 
BETH (torn) Shit. 
She kisses him. They kiss, long and hard. Abruptly, she breaks the embrace and moves away from him. 
BETH (ironically self-aware) I just fleeced a widow. 
SID (protesting) No... 
BETH It was all junk. 
She shivers. 
BETH Shit. I've got to get some aspirin... (shaking her head) I didn't drink enough to be hung over. 
She walks away from Sid, out of the bedroom. 
INT. BETH'S BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER 
Beth gulps down aspirin. She stares at herself in the mirror, wearily searching. 
IN THE MIRROR 
Sid appears in the doorway, his reflection small next to the reflection of her face. 
SID You just feel bad for her like I feel bad for her... 'cause her husband died.

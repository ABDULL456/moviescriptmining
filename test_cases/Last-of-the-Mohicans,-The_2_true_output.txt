on his back, his tomahawk within reach on the ground. 
OTTAWA & FRENCH 
are fifty yards away from the crescent mound behind which lie our people. Mist envelops them ... 
CHINGACHGOOK 
His massive arms spread revealing his war club in his left fist; his fusil in his right hand. 
HAWKEYE 
waiting for the attack. Cora's eyes are anxious, but there's no terror there. Nathaniel's impressed with her cool. He hands her a pistol. She takes it. He listens for the soft drop of moccasined feet ... 
OTTAWA 
through the grass. Thirty feet away they stop. They're motionless. Then their leader gestures and they start backing out. The French Rangers continue towards the crescent. The Ottawa chief takes one's arm and stops him. The French Ranger whispers something inaudible. The Ottawa chief shakes his head, "Non. Pas possible ..." And means it. They retreat. 
SEPERATE SHOTS: HAWKEYE, UNCAS, CHINGACHGOOK, CORA 
tensely monitor the Ottawa retreat. 
UNCAS & ALICE 
He slowly removes his hand from her mouth. She's a little shy, then she looks up, catches his eyes. Then she averts her face. 
CHINGACHGOOK 
sees all of it; doesn't like it. 
HAWKEYE 
The Ottawa are gone. 
CORA (quietly) Why did they turn back? 
In answer Hawkeye looks behind & above her head. 
CORA 
turns and makes out stilt platforms of skeletons and torn strips of buckskin silhouetted against the night sky in the distance. They have camped on sanctified ground, a burial place. 
CORA & HAWKEYE 
She thinks it would be a mistake to ever underestimate the skill of these men or the danger & complexity of this place. She hands the pistol back to him. Their hands almost touch. 
CORA (still pissed off) "We're a breed apart and we make no sense" ...? 
HAWKEYE (smiles) In your particular case, miss, I would make some allowance ... 
CORA (sarcastic) Thank you so much. 
Cora is angry. Hawkeye, staring at the trees, glances at her. She settles, looking at him. Her mood changes. Then ... 
CORA You called Chingachgook your "father"? Where is your real family? 
Hawkeye's surprised by her question. 
HAWKEYE They buried my ma & pa and my sisters. And Chingachgook - who found me with two French trappers - raised me up as his own. 
CORA I'm sorry. 
HAWKEYE I do not remember them. I was one or two. 
CORA How did you learn English? 
HAWKEYE My father sent Uncas & I to Reverend Wheelock's school when I was ten. So we would know both worlds ... though we were told only bother learning readin' & arithmetic from yous. 
CORA And what were the consequentialities of European culture you didn't bother with? 
HAWKEYE The Bible. Monarchy. Many wrong ideas about the government of men. My father's people already know each man is his own nation. And only he can have dominion over himself. Not kings. No man is better than any other man. 
CORA In London those radical ideas could land you in Newgate prison. (changing the subject) Why were those people living in this defenseless place ...? 
HAWKEYE 'Cos frontier land's the only land affordable to poor people. So after seven years indentured service in Virginia, they headed out here where they are beholden to none and not livin' by another's leave ... Their name was Cameron. John & Alexandria. 
Cora sees the slate grey clouds and, in between, the fields of stars. She looks at 	Hawkeye; then again up at the night sky. 
HAWKEYE (continuing; looking up) My father's people say ... at the birth of the sun and of his brother, the moon, their mother died ... so the sun gave to the earth her body, from which was to spring all life. And he drew forth from her breast the stars. The stars he threw into the night sky to remind him of her soul. (the sky) So there is the Camerons' monument ... my folks', too, I guess. 
CORA'S 
pensive. Hawkeye's watching her. Her reaction is enigmatic. After a pause ... 
CORA (low) You are right, Mr. Poe. We do not understand what is happening here. And it is not as I imagined it would be, thinking of it in Boston and London ... 
HAWKEYE Sorry to disappoint you ... 
CORA (eyes downcast) On the contrary. It is more deeply stirring ... to my blood ... (then up into his eyes) ... than any imagining could possibly have been ... 
She closes her eyes, turns slightly and prepares to sleep. Hawkeye is the one left staring into the birch forest, a little surprised. Some of his assumptions about her were wrong ... 
CUT TO ...

That's RICK CHARLTON: late 40's, thinning hair, friendly. Charlton heads around a corner. Mackelway follows. 
CHARLTON (CONT'D) Ms. Potter's the nice girl you met at the desk. She puts a package together for all the new agents, things to know about the area, help with finding apartments and such. This one's yours: 
Charlton stops at a CUBICLE: Carpeted walls, formica desk. A corner of dull Hell. Mackelway eyes it, fighting dread. 
CHARLTON (CONT'D) Not so different from Dallas, is it? 
MACKELWAY (fuck yes) No, Sir. 
CHARLTON Good. 
An abandoned SPORTS PAGE tells us about that World Series, so we must be mid-October. Charlton heads out. Mackelway throws a briefcase on to the desk, setting up his world: 
A framed picture of himself and his BROTHER, ages 10 and 15, on a childhood camping trip. Address book, coffee-warmer, calendar, a baseball covered with autographs. 
He opens up a drawer, and casually tosses two bottles of BUFFERIN into the back of it. 
...but first grabs four tablets from one of the bottles, and throws them down his throat, as: 
GRIEVES (O.S.) Ya like Frito Pies? 
Mackelway turns. BILL GRIEVES stands here, holding a white grease-stained paper-bag. Grieves is Mackelway's age, not quite as ambitious. But solid, decent. 
MACKELWAY I dunno. What are they? 
Grieves pulls out a greasy concoction that's wrapped up like a semi-burrito. Pure Texas. Tosses it to Mackelway: 
GRIEVES Welcome to the minors. 
Grieves passes by with a faint smile, handing out lunch to a few other agents. Mackelway eyes the still-wrapped Frito Pie. God, get me outta here... 
CUT TO: 
6   INT. WICHITA FALLS F.B.I. OFFICE - LATER                          6 
A BRIEF MONTAGE: Mackelway, in his cubicle, watching as THOSE OTHER AGENTS take calls, strap on guns, head out on assignment. Men in motion. 
But Mackelway's land-locked, writing up an Auto-Theft report. It's drudgery, but he's meticulous about it, deleting the word "beige" and replacing it with "tan." 
His head is throbbing - not an unusual circumstance for him. But after lingering for a half-second on that "Most-Wanted List" again? Starkey? It's a wound... 
7   INT. F.B.I. OFFICE - KITCHENETTE - MOMENTS LATER                  7 
Mackelway struggles with a COFFEE MACHINE that's unfamiliar to him. Filter, water, grounds, etc. 
KATIE (O.S.) Here. Lemme do that. 
He turns. This is KATIE POTTER. She's 25, friendly, under- challenged by her job. Been here two years. In two seconds she's got the thing percolating. Of course. 
KATIE (CONT'D) It takes some experience. 
He shrugs, not feeling too smooth. 
KATIE (CONT'D) You're Mackelway, right? 
MACKELWAY Mmm-hmm. 
KATIE Fax came in for you. It's the room next door. 
MACKELWAY Oh. Thanks. 
He rises, heads for the "fax room"... 
8   INT. "FAX ROOM" - CONTINUING                                      8 
A former closet, converted into useful space. FIVE FAX MACHINES sit on stands, sharing a surge protector. One fax machine is printing. Mackelway approaches it. 
Six pieces of paper await him. The first is a TOP-SHEET, written by hand: "Attention: Agent Thomas Mackelway, FBI Resident Agency - Wichita Falls." No sender named. 
He looks beneath the top sheet - at Page One of the fax. 
A young BOY stares back at him, his face photostatically copied. Across the top, also-handwritten: "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" At the bottom of the sheet, typed, we read: 
"Jason Corey, Age 14. Ht. 5'1", Wt. 130, Eyes Brn, Hair Brn. Last Seen: Riverside, Ca. Date of Disappearance: 10-16-99." 
Mackelway eyes the face, then the vitals. No idea why this was sent to him. Then he looks at Page Two. 
A young WOMAN stares back at him this time. Another faxed photo. Another "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" scrawled across the top of it. And, at the bottom of the sheet: 
"Anna Casitas, Age 22. Ht. 5'6", Wt. 125, Eyes Brn, Hair Blk. Last Seen: Macon, Ga. Date of Disappearance: 5-6-00." 
The other three faxes are more of the same: Pictures and vitals. Faces. Facts. "HAVE YOU SEEN ME?" 
He looks at the bottom of the transmissions, finds the fax number of the sender. Dials it. All he hears back is the loud grainy shriek of a dedicated fax line. 
He eyes the faxes again. It's not alarming, but it's odd. Then Charlton emerges from his office, shouting: 
CHARLTON Mackelway! You gonna sit on your ass all day, or do you wanna do something? 
Mackelway's out of this room in an instant. 
CUT TO: 
9   EXT. REST STOP - OFF THE INTERSTATE - DAY                         9 
Your standard roadside rest-stop: a parking lot with weeds poking through it and bathrooms you wouldn't go near. Those STORMCLOUDS we saw earlier are CLOSER now... 
POLICE CARS and HIGHWAY PATROL MOTORCYCLES fill this site. Charlton's FBI SEDAN pulls up. He and Mackelway get out. 
Two men approach: SHERIFF HARRY DYLAN, 50; and his deputy, BUD GRANGER, a gangly, baby-faced pup.

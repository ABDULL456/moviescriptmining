ANDY They don't know... they've gotta run more tests. 
LYNNE (starting to cry) Have you told your family? 
ANDY No, NO!  Not yet.  I feel bad -- I've jerked 'em around so many times. 
George and Zmuda glance skeptically at each other.  Hmm... Confused, George leans in to Andy. 
GEORGE Andy... you look me in the eye, and tell me this is true. 
Andy gulps. 
ANDY George -- it's true. 
INT. DENNY'S BATHROOM - NIGHT 
George confronts Zmuda. 
GEORGE If I find out you're behind this, I'll kill you. 
ZMUDA What are ya TALKIN' ABOUT?!  I was the one saying I didn't believe it! 
GEORGE Exactly.  That's the sort of thing you guys would work out to fuck me up. 
INT. LAUREL CANYON HOUSE - DAY 
Andy is doing laundry.  He empties the clean clothes, puts them in a basket, and carries them to the rug.  Then he sits down and starts laying out pairs of socks in highly symmetrical patterns.  Focused, impassive, Andy pointlessly orders the socks like the world depended on it. 
Lynne enters, emotionally wrecked.  She stares in frustration at Andy's behavior. 
LYNNE How can you be so casual??! 
ANDY (he shrugs) Even if I'm dying -- I still need clean socks. 
LYNNE You're NOT DYING! 
ANDY Okay.  You're probably right. 
He keeps working.  Lynne loses it. 
LYNNE God, you're so detached!! 
Lynne storms out. 
Andy finishes his socks.  Satisfied... he turns on the TV. 
ON THE TV: It's "Lassie."  Little TIMMY is laid-up in bed, with a broken leg.  Suddenly LASSIE runs in, holding a book. Lassie places the book on his lap.  The boy smiles gratefully. 
TIMMY (ON TV) Thank you, girl.  You're my best friend. 
Timmy warmly embraces the dog. 
ANDY - is terribly touched.  Tears start rolling down his face. 
Genuine sobbing.  Terrible grief, until he wipes his cheeks. Andy collects himself, then reaches for a phone.  He dials a long number. 
ANDY (on phone) Dad...? 
CUT TO: 
INT. CEDARS SINAI, RADIATION ROOM - DAY ANDY lies under the machine.  It bombards his body with powerful radiation. 
INT. CEDARS SINAI, DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY 
The whole Kaufman family is gathered.  Stanley, Janice, Michael and Carol listen to a BLAND DOCTOR in a white coat. 
DOCTOR The cancer started in Andy's left arm and spread to his lungs.  We've initiated an aggressive radiation program... see if we can eradicate the affected cells. (his BEEPER goes off) Excuse me.  I'll be right back. 
The doctor leaves.  A somber silence -- and then Janice bursts into tears.  Stanley hugs her tightly. 
Carol watches the doctor with great hostility.  His old tennis shoes are grabbing her attention.  He leaves, and she frowns. 
CAROL What a crock. 
STANLEY (angered) How dare you make light of this! 
CAROL Dad, I cried when he broke his neck. He's not gettin' me again -- 
STANLEY (impassioned) Jesus!  He's got lung cancer! 
A standoff moment.  Carol loses it. 
CAROL See, that's exactly it!  He picked lung cancer, because he doesn't smoke.  That makes it weird!  If he'd picked leukemia, it'd be totally believable, and we'd all be going, "Poor Andy, he's really sick."  So he chose lung cancer, because he WANTS us to be scratching our heads, saying, "Is this real?" 
JANICE (trying to convince herself) Of course it's real.  We're in a hospital... 
MICHAEL Mom, it's Cedars-Sinai!  It's a showbiz hospital!  Andy's studio friends probably run this place! 
CAROL He plans these things out.  He takes over, hires actors... (beat) Personally, I didn't think that "doctor" was very convincing. 
MICHAEL Did you notice his costume had the wrong shoes? 
CAROL (excited) Yeah!  He didn't have doctor shoes! 
A moment of total silence.  All four of them look at each other.  Is there... a glimmer of hope? 
MICHAEL We all know he's talked about faking his own death... 
STANLEY Sure -- but what if he isn't? (sad; poignant) My son could be dying... and we're actin' like we're on Candid Camera.

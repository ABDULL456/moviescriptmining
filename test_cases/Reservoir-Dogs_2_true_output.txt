22     INT. WAREHOUSE - DAY - MR. BLONDE AND COP 
Mr. Blonde closes the door after them.  He then slowly turns his head towards the cop. 
MR. BLONDE Alone at last. 
C.U. COP'S FACE. 
MR. BLONDE (OS) Now where were we? 
COP I told you I don't know anything about any fucking set up.  I've only been on the force eight months, nobody tells me anything! I don't know anything!  You can torture me if you want-- 
MR. BLONDE (OS) --Thanks, don't mind if I do. 
COP Your boss even said there wasn't a set up. 
MR. BLONDE (OS) First off, I don't have a boss. Are you clear about that? 
He SLAPS the cop's face. 
MR. BLONDE (OS) I asked you a question.  Are you clear about that? 
COP Yes. 
MR. BLONDE (OS) Now I'm not gonna bullshit you.  I don't really care about what you know or don't know.  I'm gonna torture you for awhile regardless. Not to get information, but because torturing a cop amuses me. There's nothing you can say, there's nothing you can do. Except pray for death. 
He puts a piece of tape over the cop's mouth. 
COP'S POV 
Mr. Blonde walks away from the cop. 
MR. BLONDE Let's see what's on K-BILLY'S "super sounds of the seventies" weekend. 
He turns on the radio. 
Stealer's Wheel's hit "Stuck in the Middle with You" PLAYS over the speaker. 
NOTE: This entire sequence is timed to the music. 
Mr. Blonde slowly walks toward the cop. 
He opens a large knife. 
He grabs a chair, places it in front of the cop and sits in it. 
Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, holding the knife, singing along with the song. 
Then, like a cobra, he LASHES out. 
A SLASH across the face. 
The cop/camera moves around wildly. 
Mr. Blonde just stares into the cop's/our face, singing along with the seventies hit.

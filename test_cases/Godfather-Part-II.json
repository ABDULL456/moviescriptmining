{"train": "The Godfather: Part two \nTHE GODFATHER \nPart Two \nScreenplay by \nMario Puzo \nand \nFrancis Ford Coppola \nSECOND DRAFT \nSeptember 24, 1973 \nFADE IN: \nThe Paramount Pictures logo is presented over a simple black background, as a single trumpet plays the familiar theme of a waltz.  White lettering fades in: \nMario Puzo's THE GODFATHER \nThere is a pause, as the trumpet concludes, and there is the additional title: - Part Two - \nINT. DON CORLEONE'S OLD OFFICE - CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL CORLEONE - DAY \nstanding impassively, like a young Prince, recently crowned King. \nCLOSE VIEW ON Michael's hand.  ROCCO LAMPONE kisses his hand. Then it is taken away.  We can SEE only the empty desk and chair of Michael's father, Vito Corleone.  We HEAR, over this, very faintly a funeral dirge played in the distance, as THE VIEW MOVES SLOWLY CLOSER to the empty desk and chair. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. A SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - FULL VIEW - DAY \nWe can barely make out the funeral procession passing over the burnt-brown of a dry river bed.  The figures move slowly, seemingly from out of hundreds of years of the past. \nThe MUSICIANS walking unsteadily on the rocky bed, their instruments harsh and blaring. \nThey are followed by six young peasant men, carrying the crude wooden coffin on their shoulders.  Then the widow, a strong large woman, dressed in black, and not accepting the arms of those walking with her. \nBehind her, not more than twenty relatives, few children and paisani continue alone behind the coffin. \nSuddenly, we HEAR the shots of the lupara, and the musicians stop their playing.  The entire procession scatters in odd directions along the rocky river bed. \nThe young men struggle with the burden of the heavy coffin, throwing it out of balance and nearly crashing to the ground. We hear a woman SCREAMING: \nWOMAN (Sicilian) They've killed young Paolo!  They've killed the boy Paolo! \nEXT. SICILIAN LANDSCAPE - MED. VIEW - DAY \nacross the slain body of a fourteen year old boy, lying on the parched ground.  In the distance we see four or five of the mourning women, the wind blowing their black dresses and veils, running up to the body of the boy.  They begin to wail, and cry out in anguished Sicilian, as the widow, the mother of the murdered boy, holds her child in her arms, his fresh blood wetting her strong hands. \nEXT. BARONIAL ESTATE - TIGHT MOVING VIEW - DAY \nA boy, eight or nine, with wide, frightened eyes, being pulled quickly by the hand.  This is VITO ANDOLINI, who is to become The Godfather. \nThe VIEW ALTERS revealing that he is being pulled along by his Mother, the Widow, across a field leading to the ornamental gates of a Baronial Estate of some forgotten Noble. \nAt various positions near the gates are men with shotguns, or lupara.  The gates are opened; and the Widow and her boy are shown before DON FRANCESCO, a man in his sixties.  He wears his trousers with suspenders, and an open white shirt sloppily tucked in over his enormous belly.  He wears a hat to protect him from the white-hot sun, and proudly displays a gold watch and chain over his vest. \nHe sits in a chair, near a group of his men in the garden, listening to the Widow, who stands before him with her only son. \nWIDOW (Sicilian) Don Francesco.  You murdered my husband, because he would not bend. And his oldest son Paolo, because he swore revenge.  But Vitone is only nine, and dumb-witted.  He never speaks. \nDON FRANCESCO (Sicilian) I'm not afraid of his words. \nWIDOW (Sicilian) He is weak. \nDON FRANCESCO (Sicilian) He will grow strong. \nWIDOW (Sicilian) The child cannot harm you. \nDON FRANCESCO (Sicilian) He will be a man, and then he will come for revenge. \nAs she pleads, the Widow moves closer to the Don, until she has practically thrown herself to her knees before him. \nWIDOW (Sicilian) I beg you, Don Francesco, spare my only son.  He is all I have.  In the name of the Holy Spirit, I swear he will never be a danger to you... \nSuddenly, she reaches under her skirt, where she has hidden a kitchen knife. \nWIDOW (continuing) But I will kill you myself! (she lunges at the Mafia chieftain) Vitone, go! \nThe boy runs as fast as he can out through the gates.  Then there is a lupara blast.  He turns, and sees his Mother flung a distance of five feet from the short range of the terrible blast of the shotgun.  Then he sees the men turn their attention to him.  One fires at him; but the boy is quick, and disappears into a grove of olive trees. \nEXT. STREETS OF CORLEONE - NIGHT \nTwo men roam the deserted streets of Corleone, carrying lupare.  Every so often, they stop, and one shouts in a loud, almost singsong voice, like a fish peddler.  Their names are MOSCA and STROLLO. \nMOSCA (Sicilian) Our Friend promises misery to anyone who harbors the boy Vito Andolini. (he turns and shouts in the other direction) Our Friend promises misery to anyone who harbors the boy Vito Andolini. \nINT. A HOUSE - NIGHT \nA family quietly eats their dinner.  The father is the local policeman, as indicated by his uniform jacket and gun, hanging nearby. \nSTROLLO (Sicilian, O.S.) Our Friend will be hard with any family who gives help to Vito Andolini. \nOne of the children looks up, about to speak.  But the father sternly indicates that nothing must be said.  They go on with their dinner. \nEXT. THE STREETS OF CORLEONE - FULL VIEW - NIGHT \nThe men continue walking up and throughout the streets, far in the distance. \nMOSCA (Sicilian O.S.) ...misery to any family who harbors the boy, Vito... \nINT. A BARN - NIGHT \nFour little girls watch with wide eyes as their mother and father bind Vito tightly in swaddled cloth, and then lift him up to the side of a mule; counter-balancing a heavy load of firewood.  The father looks at the boy's almost stoically calm little face. \nFATHER (Sicilian) Vito...We pray for you. \nHe pulls the fabric over the boy's face. \nMOSCA (Sicilian O.S.) ...Andolini... \nSTROLLO (Sicilian O.S.) Our Friend promises misery to any family... \nEXT. THE CHURCH PLAZA - NIGHT \nThe men continue on their night-walk, up to the plaza of the church. \nSTROLLO (Sicilian) ...who harbors the boy Vitone Andolini. \nThe figure of a single man on a mule passes them. \nMOSCA (Sicilian) Let no one give help to the boy Vito Andolini... \nThe man on the mule makes his way out of the village and disappears into the distance. \nWe begin to hear, very quietly, the Waltz repeated once again. \nEXT. STEAMSHIP - CLOSE VIEW ON VITO - DAY \nKAY Thank you. \nShe smiles as she leaves the photographer, and then lets out a weary sigh to Mama, as she touches the slightly protruding belly. \nKAY Do you think it'll show in the picture? \nMAMA Two months never shows.  Two months look like you had a big lunch. \nVOICE (O.S.) Oh, Mrs. Corleone. \nA slender, aristocratic WOMAN in her late forties is waving to KAY. \nMRS. BARRETT Hello, Mrs. Corleone.  I'm Fran Barrett, our place is just down the lake.  This is my husband, Marshall. \nKAY I'm so happy you could come. \nMR. BARRETT The place is transformed.  We've been watching workmen come and go all summer. \nMRS. BARRETT Where is Mr. Corleone? \nKAY A business meeting ran late...but he promised he wouldn't be long. \nKay puts her arm around little Anthony's shoulder. \nKAY This is our son Anthony Vito Corleone.  Today he made his First Holy Communion. \nEXT. TAHOE GATE AND KENNELS - DAY \nA confusion of cars; arriving and parking.  The squad of parking attendants are supplemented by a whole team of the local Police, working as high-class parking valets. \nA very beautiful, statuesque woman, though slightly drunk, DEANNA DUNN, slams the door of a powder blue Mercedes and hurries barefoot through the great stone gate. \nDEANNA I will not shut my mouth, and keep your Goddamn hands off of me! \nShe is followed by a harried, FREDDIE CORLEONE, dressed with flash in the Hollywood style, and carrying her shoes in his hands. \nFREDO Honey!  Wait a minute; let's go for a drive. \nDEANNA I just had a drive; besides, I want to see my brother-in-law Michael. \nFREDO (trying to get her to put her shoes on) Yeah, but I don't want him to see you. \nDeanna pauses reflectively a moment, allowing Fredo to get her shoes on. \nDEANNA What beats me, is how you guys could be brothers.  You musta been your Mother's rotten egg. \nShe kicks off the shoes, giggling, and runs toward a waiter. \nDEANNA (lifting a glass of champagne) Young man, young man...thank you, young man. \nWAITER (impressed) Excuse me, but aren't you... \nDEANNA Yes, you saw me in the movies, Good Humor man, and yes, I had more off than my shoes! \nFREDO Goddamn bitch. \nDEANNA Relax, Freddie honey.  Come dance with me. \nShe extends her hand to him. \nFREDO Listen, Michael's got a lot of nice people here.  Friends of Kay's. He'll never forgive me if you ruin his party. \nDEANNA I hate to see you cringe in front of him.  How come you're so scared of your own kid brother? \nFREDO He's the head of the family. \nDisgusted, she turns around, and heads toward the music. \nDEANNA Don't follow me! \nEXT. TAHOE LAWN AND TABLES - MED. SHOT - DAY \nRushing through the tables, waving an arm jangling with gold jewelry, and carrying several gift-wrapped packages, is a hardened and aging CONNIE CORLEONE.  She is followed by a blond, and wrinkled-handsome escort named MERLE. \nCONNIE Mama...Mama!  Here I am! \nShe throws her arms around her Mother, who returns the affection somewhat reproachfully. \nMAMA Constanzia.  We expected you last week; we sent the car to pick you up at the airport last week. \nCONNIE I know, it was chaos; but anyway, here I am one week late. (lifting a shiny green package out of Merle's arms) This is for my Mama.  You remember Merle? \nMAMA (not giving him a chance to greet her) Yes, thank you. \nCONNIE How are the kids? \nMAMA Well, thank you, they asked for you all week. \nCONNIE I got surprises for everybody! \nMAMA (glancing at the wrapping) Bought at the airport. \nCONNIE (gazing about) This is swell.  Where's Michael? I've got things to get straight with him and I can't wait on line. \nMAMA You go see your children first, and then you wait to see your brother like everybody else. \nEXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY \nA porch-like foyer of the boathouse, where a group of five or six men wait, some nervously.  Some sit, and some pace. \nMED. CLOSE VIEW \non one of these men, FRANKIE PENTANGELI, approaching his sixties, with gray hair (the little of it left).  He's a bit scruffy, this morning's shave of his white beard is not perfect, and he seems tired.  He is accompanied by an associate-bodyguard, WILLY CICCI; thin and dark, and also dressed up for the occasion.  Frankie tries to get the attention of one of the waiters; a college-groomed young man in white sports jacket and black bow-tie. \nPENTANGELI Hey, kid!  You got any red wine? \nWAITER (offering the tray) Only champagne and cocktails. \nPENTANGELI Forget it... \nFinally, he sees someone he recognizes, Fredo, and shouts out in a husky voice: \nPENTANGELI Fredo!  Sonuvabitch.  You look great. \nFredo squints in his direction; finally recognizes him. \nFREDO Who's that?  Pentangeli?  Frankie \"Five-Angels\"...thought you were never coming West. \nPENTANGELI (affectionately) Gotta check up on my boys.  Hey, what's with the food?  Some kid in a white jacket brings me a ritz cracker with some chopped liver. 'Canapes,' he says.  I say, 'Can a peas, my ass, that's a ritz cracker with chopped liver.' Go get me a salami sandwich and a glass of wine or I'll send you and your white jacket to the dry cleaners! \nThey get a good laugh at this fresh breath of New York. \nFREDO Gee, Frankie, it's good to see you. Reminds me of old times. \nPENTANGELI You remember Willy Cicci, don't you, Freddie?  We was all together with the old man Clemenza in Brooklyn... before...uh... \nFREDO We were all upset about that. \nPENTANGELI That's what I'm here to talk to your brother about.  What's with him, I got to get a letter of introduction to have a 'sitdown'? \nFREDO (throwing his arm around him) C'mon, I see what I can do. \nEXT. TAHOE PAVILION - MED. VIEW - DAY \nCONNIE How are you, honey?  You've met Merle, haven't you.  He was with me in Vegas. \nMICHAEL I saw him with you. \nCONNIE We're going to Europe next week.  I want to get passage booked on the Queen. \nMICHAEL Why do you come to me?  Why don't you go to a travel agent? \nMERLE We're going to get married first. \nMichael is silent.  Then he rises, and moves to the window overlooking the lake. \nMICHAEL The ink on your divorce isn't dry. Your children see you on weekends; your oldest boy, Michael Francis... was in some trouble with the Reno police over some petty theft that you don't even know about. \nCONNIE Michael... \nMICHAEL You fly around the world with lazy young men who don't have any love for you, and use you like a whore. \nCONNIE You're not my father! \nMICHAEL Then why do you come to me? \nCONNIE Because I need MONEY! \nMICHAEL (softly) Connie, I want to be reasonable with you.  You have a house here, with us.  You can live here with your kids...and you won't be deprived of anything.  I don't know much about Merle; I don't know what he does for a living; what he lives on.  Why don't you tell him marriage is really out of the question; and that you can't see him any more. He'll understand.  But if you disobey me, and marry this pimp...it would disappoint me. \nCONNIE It was my father's money; and I'm entitled to what I need.  Where is Tom Hagen? \nShe turns angrily, leaving Michael standing face to face with Merle. \nMICHAEL Are you finished? \nMERLE I think so. \nMICHAEL Then out. \nMerle puts out his cigarette and leaves, quickly. \nEXT. TAHOE PAVILION - FULL VIEW - DAY \nThe orchestra has struck up a \"Paul Jones,\" where two concentric circles of young people march in opposite directions, until the music stops.  Then they take whomever is opposite them as their new dance partner. \nVIEW ON THE HARBOR AREA \nFrancesca and her twin, Gardner and their elite young friends roar out of the private harbor, to get up on the water skis.  We notice ROCCO LAMPONE, move along a path leading to a separate and more private boathouse.  A small covered craft approaches, ties off, and a group of three men step on to the pathway, shake hands with Lampone - and follow him to the large boathouse where Michael conducts his business. \nCLOSE VIEW \nPentangeli has led Mama up to the dance floor, and is having some difficulty with the orchestra. \nPENTANGELI I can't believe that out of thirty professional musicians, not one of you is Italian! (as the musicians laugh) C'mon, give us a tarantella. \nHe waves his hands, conducting, and singing.  The piano starts a vamp, the drums uncertainly join in.  A clarinet starts to play \"Pop Goes the Weasel,\" and soon the rest of the orchestra is playing that.  They look to Pentangeli for approval.  Disgusted, he goes back to his table, eating a handful of canapes. \nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY \nRocco ushers an older Italian, bundled up against the cold and wet of his boatride, to Michael. \nThe man shows respect to Michael, who quickly indicates that Neri should get him a drink. \nMICHAEL Rocco, his friends must be hungry. See what you can do, but I'd like to keep them away from the guests. \nThe older man, JOHNNY 'BLUE BOY' OLA, gestures to his bodyguards, and they follow Lampone. \nMICHAEL You know my lawyer, Tom Hagen. Johnny Ola. \nOLA Sure, I remember Tom from the old days. \nTom shakes hands with Ola, remembering him, and his importance. \nMICHAEL Tom isn't going to sit in with us, Johnny.  He only handles specific areas of the family business.  Tom? \nHAGEN Sure, Mikey. \nHe gathers up some of his papers, as the three men remain silent, waiting for him to go before they talk.  It's clear Tom doesn't want to be excluded. \nHAGEN If you need anything, just... \nMICHAEL Just tell Rocco I'm waiting. \nHagen nods and leaves.  As soon as the door closes: \nOLA I just left our friend in Miami. \nMICHAEL How is his health? \nOLA Not good. \nMICHAEL Is there anything I can do; anything I can send? \nOLA He appreciates your concern, Michael, and your respect. \nThere's a KNOCK on the door; a moment, and then Rocco quietly enters and takes his place without disturbing the conversation. \nOLA The hotel's registered owners are one Jacob Lawrence, and Sidney Barclay, both Beverly Hills attorneys.  In reality it's split between the Old Lakeville Road Group from Cleveland, and our friend in Miami.  He takes care of others outside the country, you know who I mean.  Meyer Klingman runs the store, and does all right, but I've been instructed to tell you, that if you move him out, our friend in Miami will go along with you. \nMICHAEL He's very kind, tell him it's appreciated.  I'm sure it will be profitable all the way around. \nOLA He always makes money for his partners.  One by one, our old friends are gone.  Death, natural or not, prison, deported.  Our friend in Miami is the only one left, because he always made money for his partners. \nThe door opens suddenly, and standing there in his white Communion suit, is Michael's boy Anthony.  A moment later, Kay appears, and takes the boy's hand. \nKAY Anthony, Daddy's busy. \nMICHAEL (rising) This is my boy, and my wife.  Mr. John Ola of Miami. \nKAY I'm sorry, Michael.  Senator Geary's here, and Mr. and Mrs. Barrett wanted to thank you before they left.  Won't you join us, Mr. Ola? \nMICHAEL Mr. Ola's just leaving, Kay. Please tell the Senator I won't be a minute. \nPause; she stands there a moment. \nMICHAEL (continuing) Kay. \nKAY Yes, Michael. \nEXT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY \nKay closes the door.  It seems as though Michael has violated some sort of promise to her by having this man here today. She looks up toward the first boathouse. \nWHAT SHE SEES: \nThe covered launch, and Ola's three bodyguards, eating while they wait. \nMED. VIEW \nAnthony runs away from her, heading toward the house. \nKAY Anthony! (she runs after him) Anthony, where are you going? \nMoodily, the boy stops, turns, and walks back to his table of honor without answering her. \nEXT. TAHOE TABLES AND PAVILION - VIEW ON THE PAVILION - DAY \nVIEW ON GEARY \nrising. \nSENATOR GEARY I'll expect your answer, with payment, by tomorrow morning.  Only don't contact me...from now on, deal only through Turnbull. \nHe is almost out the door. \nMICHAEL Senator... (cold and calm) ...you can have my answer now if you'd like. \nGeary turns back. \nMICHAEL My offer is this.  Nothing...not even the thousand dollars for the Gaming Commission, which I'd appreciate if you would put up personally. \nGeary returns Michael's hard look; then laughs and leaves. Slowly Michael turns to Hagen. \nVIEW ON HAGEN \nembarrassed at being so off the mark. \nMICHAEL It's all right, Tom, we'll talk later.  Tell Frankie Pentangeli I'd like him to have dinner at my family table before we do business. \nEXT. THE PAVILION - NIGHT \nNow the light has faltered, and the young waiters have put up the night lights.  The tables are all properly set for dinner, with candles on each one. \nThe orchestra is playing quiet, unobtrusive dinner music, and many of the guests have begun to help themselves to the impressive buffet, under a party tent. \nMED. VIEW \nMichael sits at a large table with Kay, his son Anthony, Mama, Hagen and TERESA, Connie and Merle' Fredo and Deanna, and Frankie Pentangeli. \nMAMA Cent' Anne. \nThis, the table of honor, all raise their glasses and repeat the toast. \nDEANNA What's 'cent' Anne?' \nFREDO A hundred years...it's a toast. \nCONNIE It means we should all live happily for one hundred years.  The family. If my Father were alive, it'd be true. \nMAMA Connie. \nCONNIE Merle, have you met my sister-in- law Deanna? \nDEANNA What a pleasure, Merle. (shaking hands) \nMAMA (Sicilian) Those two are perfect for each other. \nMERLE What's that mean? \nCONNIE Mama! \nPENTANGELI (Sicilian) Michael, in all respect, I didn't come three thousand miles for dinner. \nMICHAEL (Sicilian) I know. \nPENTANGELI (Sicilian) When do we talk? \nMICHAEL (Sicilian) After dinner. \nBy now, the conversation has become exclusively Sicilian, with Merle and Deanna, looking from side to side like in a tennis match.  Finally, Kay, to be polite: \nKAY Anthony, you were talking to Mr. Pentangeli? \nANTHONY His name is \"Five-Angels.\" \nPENTANGELI Yeah, the kid and me talked Sicilian. A one-way conversation! \nINT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nPentangeli is angry; but because it is Michael he is talking to, he keeps his voice low and represses his desire to shout. \nPENTANGELI Sure, Pete Clemenza died of a heart attack, but the Rosato Brothers gave it to him. \nMICHAEL We were all heartbroken at the news; but that wasn't cause to start a war. \nPENTANGELI Okay, now it's my family in Brooklyn; and I wanna keep up Clemenza's loyalty to you.  But how can I run my family with you challenging my every move?  You're too far from the street, Mike, the only way to reason with the Rosato Brothers is to whack 'em and whack 'em fast. \nMICHAEL You were unfair with them. \nPENTANGELI Says who? \nMICHAEL Clemenza promised Rosato three territories in the Bronx after he died, and then you took over and welched. \nPENTANGELI Clemenza promised them nothing, he hated the sonsuvbitches. \nMICHAEL They feel cheated. \nPENTANGELI Michael, you're sitting up here in the Sierra Mountains with champagne cocktails making judgment on the way I run my family. \nMICHAEL (suddenly in Sicilian) Your family still carries the name Corleone, and you will run it like a Corleone! \nPENTANGELI (Sicilian) And while I feed my family in New York, you put the knife in my back in Miami. \nMICHAEL (firm) Frankie, you're a good old man, and you've been loyal to my Father for years...so I hope you can explain what you mean. \nPENTANGELI The Rosatos are running crazy; taking hostages, spitting in my face, because they're backed by the Jew in Miami. \nMICHAEL I know.  That's why I want you to be fair with them. \nPENTANGELI How can you be fair with animals? They recruit niggers and spicks; they do violence in their own Grandmother's neighborhoods.  And everything is dope and whores; the gambling is left to last.  Let me run my family without you on my back.  I want them taken care of. \nMICHAEL No.  There are things that I have planned with Hyman Roth.  I don't want them disturbed. \nPENTANGELI You give your loyalty to a Jew over your own blood. \nMICHAEL Frankie, you know my father respected Roth, did business with him. \nPENTANGELI He did business...but he never trusted him. \nPentangeli takes his hat, and leaves. \nNERI Should he go? \nMICHAEL The old man had too much vino rosso, or he'd never talk openly that way.  Let him go back to New York; I've already made my plans. (he checks his watch) It's late; I've spent so little time at the party. \nEXT. THE LAWNS AND TABLES - FULL VIEW - NIGHT \nBy now the sun has fallen and the lawns of the Corleone estate are lit by moonlight.  Beautifully dressed couples dance as the orchestra plays a foxtrot of the late fifties. \nVIEW ON THE DANCE FLOOR \nDeanna has been dancing with Fredo; she has gotten drunk and it teasing her husband by flirting with other men on the floor. \nDEANNA I wanta dance...whatsa matter with that? \nFREDO Dancing is alright; you're falling on the floor. \nDEANNA Whatsamatter, you don't want me to dance with him 'cause he's a man! \nFREDO Deanna, I'm going to belt you right in the mouth! \nVito and his wife sit quietly at the table; the two are quiet and sad. \nSuddenly, we HEAR a noise, and Vito is astonished to see a young man, PETER CLEMENZA, leaning out of the window on the other side of the air shaft which separates their apartments. \nCLEMENZA Hey Paisan!  Hold this for me until I ask for it.  Hurry up! \nAutomatically Vito reaches over to the empty space at the air shaft, and takes the bundle of rags.  Clemenza's round face is strained and urgent, obviously in some kind of trouble.  Suddenly, he closes the window and there is activity that we cannot see in the other apartment. \nVito looks to his wife, and then closes the window and window dressing and takes the bundle into a private part of his kitchen and begins to unwrap it. \nWHAT HE SEES: \nFive oily guns.  He immediately wraps them again, and carries them to a private closet, and hides it, and returns to his wife.  He sits down back at the table; and she knows not to ask him what has happened. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREETS - DAY \nVito is walking through the crowded streets with a group of workmen; they all wear work clothes, and paper hats on their heads. \nVito looks to his left, and realizes that Clemenza is walking silently with him; by contrast, Clemenza dresses well. \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) (casually) Do you have my goods still? \nVito nods. \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) Did you look inside? \nVito, his face impassive, shakes his head 'no.' \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) I'm not interested in things that don't concern me. \nINT. DOWNTOWN ITALIAN SOCIAL CLUB - DAY \nVito and Clemenza drinking wine; they've become friends. \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) I have a friend who has a fine rug. Maybe your wife would like it. \nVITO (Sicilian) We have no money for a rug. \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) No.  He would give it away.  I know how to repay a consideration. \nVito thinks, then nods. \nVITO (Sicilian) She would like it. \nINT. HALLWAY WEALTHY APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY \nThe two men proceed up the hallway; Vito is impressed with the opulence. \nVITO (Sicilian) Your friend lives in a fine building. \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) Oh yes, the very best. \nClemenza knocks on the door as though he is well known here; then rings.  No answer. \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) Ah, he's not at home.  Oh, well, he wouldn't mind. \nQuickly and expertly he takes out a tool and pries open the door. \nINT. WEALTHY APARTMENT - FULL VIEW - DAY \nVito looks in awe at the luxurious apartment, which features a fabulous rich red wool rug. \nClemenza immediately moves some of the furniture away, and drops to the floor. \nCLEMENZA A little help. \nVito joins him, and the two begin rolling the rug.  We HEAR a BUZZER RING.  Clemenza immediately drops his side of the roll, and moves to the window.  He pulls a gun from his jacket. \nVIEW ON Vito watching.  He moves so he can see out the window. \nTHEIR VIEW \nA Policeman stands at the exterior door, waiting.  He rings the buzzer again. \nVIEW ON CLEMENZA \ncocking his gun.  Vito realizes that if the Policeman should pursue it any further he is a dead man.  The Policeman gives up and leaves. \nClemenza puts away his gun. \nINT. VITO'S TENEMENT HALLWAY - DAY \nThe two men run up the steps, laughing, carrying the fine rug. \nINT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY \nThey are on their knees cutting the rug to fit the small room.  Carmella watches, holding the baby SANTINO. \nMED. CLOSE ON CLEMENZA \nLike a professional, cutting quickly, with the proper tools. He sings as he works. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DOWNTOWN WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nClemenza knocks on the steel door of this downtown building. Vito waits with him, holding some packages; and another youth, TESSIO, tall and thin and deadly waits with them. \nThe door is lifted, and they are greeted by a bright, middle-aged Italian named AUGUSTINO who leads them into a machine shop. \nINT. MACHINE SHOP - NIGHT \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) Good, you waited for us. \nClemenza looks up on a higher level. \nHIS VIEW \nThere is a nine year old boy, operating a drill press. \nMED. VIEW \nTESSIO (Sicilian) Who is he? \nAUGUSTINO (Sicilian) My son, Carmine...it's all right. \nThe men then quickly open the packages they've brought; revealing gun, including a more sophisticated machine weapon. \nAugustino takes them and expertly begins to clean and prepare them. \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) (to Vito) Paisan Augustino was a gunsmith in the Italian army.  We do each other favors. \nAUGUSTINO (Sicilian) (while he works) My boy is studying the flute.  He plays very well.  He helps me at night so we can buy him a silver flute someday.  Now he has one made of wood.  Carmine...play...play for my friends. \nVIEW ON THE BOY \nwide-eyed... he shuts off the press; and takes out a shabby wooden flute.  And begins to play a simple and pure melody. \nCLOSE ON VITO \nlistening. \nCLOSE ON AUGUSTINO \nTESSIO (Sicilian) (laughs at himself) He's going to kill Fanucci. \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) (stern) Then, after that, what?  Joe 'Little Knife' Pisani; Willie Bufalino, maybe, Mr. Maranzalla himself, c'mon! \nVITO (Sicilian) Fanucci is not connected; he is alone. \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) (sarcastically) What?  You read it in the papers? \nVITO (Sicilian) This man informs to the police; this man allows his vengeance to be bought off... No, he is alone. \nTESSIO (Sicilian) If you're wrong... \nVITO (Sicilian) If I'm wrong, they will kill me. \nBoth Clemenza and Tessio are impressed with their young friend; his willingness to risk his life on his perception of the situation. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT \nA ten piece Italian street band plays in front of the church to commemorate the first night of the Festa di San Gennaro. People swarm in crowds, delighted by the music, as out of the church four men carry the statue of San Gennaro down to the street. \nMOVING VIEW \nClemenza moves along the booths that have been set up along the street: sausage cooking on an open fire; pork livers and sweetbeards.  He stops for a sandwich, and makes an irritated gesture when the vendor expects to be paid.  He crosses to a church-sponsored booth with a great Wheel of Fortune, and slaps a dollar on a number.  Standing next to him is Vito; they embrace. \nCLEMENZA (Sicilian) (quietly) All three daughters are at church; he is alone.  It's important that you let his neighbors see you leave. Tessio has broken the latch on the skylight of his building. \nThe wheel stops; they both lose. \nCLEMENZA (English) See, Brother Carmello, even the church makes numbers. \nPRIEST (English) It's only the way we collect that's different. \nVito has left while Clemenza jokes with the Priest. \nEXT. FESTA STREET - NIGHT \nVito passes the booths of food, crossing toward a small and dark club. \nINT. SOCIAL CLUB - NIGHT \nWe can still HEAR the crowds and music of the festa.  Vito enters; the club is empty, except for the large white figure sitting alone at a small table.  Fanucci barely acknowledges Vito as he joins him. \nWithout a word, Vito counts out two hundred dollars on the table.  Fanucci looks, then takes off his fedora and puts it on the table over the money. \nFANUCCI (Sicilian) I think there's only two hundred dollars under my hat. (he peeks) I'm right.  Only two hundred dollars. \nVITO (Sicilian) I'm a little short.  I've been out of work.  Let me owe you the money for a few weeks. \nFANUCCI (Sicilian) Ah, you're a sharp young fellow. How is it I've never noticed you before (he takes the two hundred and pours some wine for Vito) You're too quiet for your own interest.  I could find some work for you to do that would be very profitable. (he rises) No hard feelings, eh?  If I can ever do you a service let me know. You've done a good job for yourself tonight. \nEXT. FESTA STREET - MED. VIEW - NIGHT \nBy now the musicians have left, but still families are walking the street, and stopping at the booths. \nFanucci stands there a moment; he is known by everyone, and considers himself highly loved. \nThen Fanucci begins the walk through the festa, on his way home. \nEXT. ROOFTOPS - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT \nVito silently moves along the rooftop; paralleling Fanucci's walk. \nWe HEAR the sounds of the festa, and every so often catch a glimpse of the patterned lights, and the crowds below. \nEXT. FESTA STREETS - MOVING VIEW ON FANUCCI - NIGHT \nwalking through the crowded streets.  The statue of San Gennaro is arranged in some midnight religious ceremony. \nThe VIEW LIFTS UP, to the rooftops. \nEXT. THE ROOFTOPS - NIGHT \nVito makes the leap that separates two buildings; then crosses toward the large skylight in the center of the building. \nEXT. THE STREETS - NIGHT \nThe procession in the streets is preceded by ten altar boys; and the glittering Monstrance, something of an altar carried out into the streets. \nThe priest begins this nocturnal service, as the crowds in the street kneel down in prayer. \nINT. FANUCCI'S BUILDING - NIGHT \nFanucci unlocks the door to his building; we can HEAR the services in the background. \nEXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nVito tries the trap door on the roof; it is stuck firmly shut; despite Clemenza's instructions.  He struggles with it, but no luck. \nFrom the distance, the Choir begins to Latin.  Vito moves around the skylight, to an identical trap, tries this one; it opens. \nEXT. THE MONSTRANCE - MED. VIEW ON THE PRIEST - NIGHT \nperforming the services in Latin.  The ten altar boys are in attendance. \nEXT. THE ROOFTOP - NIGHT \nVito reaches down into the trap, and pulls out the newly oiled gun that has been left for him.  He slides down into the building. \nINT. FANUCCI'S HALLWAY - DOWN ANGLE - NIGHT \nFanucci proceeds up the staircase with loud, heavy steps. An OLD WOMAN on one of the flights sees him, and immediately moves to her apartment. \nFANUCCI (Sicilian) What's the matter, Signora?  You don't say 'good evening'? \nWOMAN (Sicilian) 'Good evening,' Signor Fanucci. \nShe quickly disappears behind her door.  Fanucci laughs, continues up, singing to himself.  The MASS outside is always in evidence. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nVito climbs down from the attic, and finds Fanucci's rear door open.  He slips in, and makes his way past the open windows, out of which pour the music and chanting of the Mass.  Slowly and quietly he pulls them down, shut. \nHe moves quietly to a glass door, and peeks out. \nWHAT HE SEES: \nThree young women, Fanucci's DAUGHTERS, laughing and talking. \nVIEW ON VITO \nA slip up.  Tessio had said they were out.  He steps outside to the alley where he can look into the apartment. \nANOTHER VIEW \nFanucci opens the door of his apartment, and enters. \nCLOSE VIEW ON VITO \nHe begins to wrap the gun. \nVIEW ON THE DAUGHTERS \nTheir father greets them with a kiss; and a little religious gift he has bought for each. \nAn arrow pointing to him is marked \"DAD.\" Under it, a nine year old's handwriting says: \"Do you like it?  Check YES __ I liked it or NO __ I didn't like it.\" Michael turns, looking for a pencil, and moves to the dresser, where he places a check next to \"YES.\" \nHe starts to cross back toward his side of the bed, when Kay turns, almost in her sleep: \nKAY Michael?  Why are the drapes open? \nHis eyes dart back to the curved, beautifully leaded windows of the room.  The DRAPES are opened.  Then, without a second's hesitation, he leaps to the floor, still holding his son's drawing, as a spray of machine gun bullets sweep across the windows; glass shattering all over the room. \nKay screams out; rising, still half-asleep.  Michael crawls toward her, and pulls her down to the floor to him. \nThen, for a moment, there is silence, soon filled by the shouts of men; as flashes of light sweep by the window, as guards with flashlights come running. \nMichael holds Kay to him, knowing they have both survived, and then gently: \nMICHAEL Go with the kids. \nEXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - NIGHT \nSuddenly, the great floodlights are turned on, bathing lawns in an intense blue light. \nGroups of ordinarily dressed security men drawn in from all directions; a state of confusion prevails.  There is no sign of the attackers. \nVIEW BY MICHAEL'S HOUSE \nMichael is joined by Rocco Lampone, his gun drawn. \nROCCO They're still on the property. Maybe you better stay inside. \nMICHAEL Keep them alive. \nSix men take up posts by Michael's house. \nROCCO We'll try. \nMICHAEL It's important. \nHe returns inside. \nEXT. MAIN GATE AND KENNELS - NIGHT \nThe character of the summer estate has changed: bright floodlights illuminate the main points of entry: the main gate; the waterway; the stone wall that encompasses the estate on all sides. \nSeveral men with flashlights reinforce the guard at the main gate. \nFULL VIEW \nOff in the distance, we see another group of men with flashlights combing the waterline.  We hear indistinguishable shouts. \nVIEW ON THE KENNELS \nThe wire gates are opened, and the trained dogs go out yelping into the outer edge of the estate. \nROOFTOP \nOne of Rocco's men turns the large floodlight scanning darkened forest areas, where men could hide. \nMOVING VIEW \nMen with flashlights and dogs.  Moving through the dark areas. \nLOOSE VIEW \nA small Corleone launch, with a bright spotlight slowly cruises the boundaries of the estate.  We SEE the silhouette of men with guns, quietly waiting and watching. \nEXT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nSome of the bodyguards by the shattered windows of Michael's bedroom. \nThe curtains are drawn from inside. \nINT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - NIGHT \nKay, the children, and some women servants have come down from the various rooms into the central living area, that can be most easily secured.  The little girl is still asleep; they make you think of an immigrant family, with their blankets and frightened faces, all waiting in a central room. \nMichael goes up to Kay, squeezes her hand, and whispers: \nMICHAEL It will be all right.  We were lucky. \nShe says nothing; but her face expresses the anger she feels over the jeopardy Michael has placed his children in.  She holds her young daughter in her arms. \nThe door opens, and Rocco enters.  He quickly realizes he is holding his gun in plain view in front of the family, and puts it away.  Michael moves to him, and they talk a distance away from Kay. \nROCCO Your family all seem to be okay in the other houses; your Mother's still sleeping. \nMICHAEL And? \nROCCO No sign of them yet; but they're still on the Estate. \nWe HEAR loud shouting from outside. \nDEANNA (O.S.) Goddamn you!  You're all nuts here, I'm not goin' to calm down... \nMICHAEL'S VIEW \nThrough the door, that Rocco opens. \nDeanna, in her nightgown, has been frightened by the gunshots; while Fredo in his bathrobe, tries to get her back into the house. \nFREDO Deanna, will you get back into the house! \nDEANNA I'm getting out of here I said; these guys all have guns! \nMICHAEL Fredo, can't you shut that woman up! (to Rocco's men) Get her in here! \nThe bodyguards, gracefully help Fredo bring the hysterical Deanna into the safety of the house. \nDEANNA (whimpering) I don't want to stay here... \nFREDO Mike, what can I do, she's a hysterical woman... \nKAY Leave her alone!  You're talking as though she has no right to be frightened when there are machine guns going off in her backyard. \nMICHAEL (to Rocco) Have Tom Hagen meet me in the Harbor House. \nEXT. TAHOE ESTATE - HIGH ANGLE - NIGHT \nMichael walks the short distance from his house, to the boathouse where he conducts his business away from his family. \nA small group of bodyguards, carrying machine guns, make the walk with him from all sides, a respectful distance away. It gives the appearance of a lonely President moving in his compound, followed by teams of Secret Service men. \nThe boathouse is already secured by teams of men, hastily wakened from their lodge house; a barracks-like structure where reinforcements are lodged just for this kind of emergency. \nFULL VIEW \nIn the distance, we can see the teams of men and dogs, with their lights, guns and shouts, combing every inch of the estate. \nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - EMPTY VIEW - NIGHT \nMichael alone in the great room.  He moves to a walk-in safe, quickly runs through the combination, and opens it. He takes out an envelope, and puts it into his pocket; there's a KNOCK on the door, and Hagen enters.  He had been asleep, and has quickly thrown on a robe. \nMICHAEL Sit down, Tom. \nEXT. TAHOE BOATHOUSE - NIGHT \nKay exits her house, followed by her children; she helps them into her station wagon like any housewife, and drives along the path leading to the main gate. \nShe's about to drive through, when one of the men steps in front of her, raising his hand. \nKAY (graciously) Yes. \nMAN I'm sorry, Mrs. Corleone.  We're not to let you through. \nKAY (disbelieving) I'm going to the market. \nMAN If you could just give us a list, we'll pick up anything you want. \nKAY Whose orders are these? \nMAN Mr. Hagen's, ma'am. \nWe notice Hagen walking to them in the background. \nHAGEN Kay. \nVIEW THROUGH THE GATE \nHagen approaches the car; Kay gets out so they can talk away from the children. \nHAGEN I wanted to explain this myself... I had business in Carson City. \nHe walks with her a little way from the others; the children run out of the station wagon, and start to play. \nHAGEN It's Michael's request...for your safety.  We can send out for anything you need. \nKAY I'm supposed to stay in my house. \nHAGEN Within the compound will be fine. \nKAY I was supposed to take the children to New England next week. \nHAGEN That's off now. \nKAY I'm going to see my parents. \nHAGEN Kay, Michael didn't tell me a lot; and what he did tell me, I can't repeat.  But the responsibility for you and the kids was the most important thing he left me with. \nKAY How long does this go on? \nHAGEN I don't know. (pause) I'm sorry, Kay... \nKAY Am I a prisoner? \nHAGEN That's not the way we look at it. \nAngrily, without another word, Kay turns away from him, and walks to her children, ignoring the running station wagon. \nEXT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - DAY \nThe luxury liner making its way across the Atlantic. \nINT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - MED. VIEW - DAY \nThe PURSER followed by several white uniformed associates knocks on the door of something designated the \"Leonardo Suite.\" He is holding a telegram. \nThe door opens, and a tanned Merle peeks out of the door. \nPURSER (holding up the telegram) I'm terribly sorry to disturb you but we have received two telegrams. \nMERLE (reluctantly) Well...come in. \nThis entourage enters the suite, an impressive and beautifully spacious luxury suite.  Connie is relaxing. \nCONNIE What is it? \nPURSER Yes.  One is from our office in New York.  The check that you wrote for your passage has been returned. \nCONNIE Can't be... \nMERLE Why don't you wire your bank? \nPURSER The other telegram is from your bank.  Your account has been closed and the company is warned not to extend any credit. \nCONNIE I'll take care of it in Naples. \nPURSER The company hopes so.  But for now, we have orders to change your accommodations. \nAnd with that, the men in white begin to pack Connie and Merle's luggage. \nCONNIE That son of a bitch! \nINT. ITALIAN LUXURY LINER - TINY THIRD CLASS CABIN - NIGHT \nConnie and Merle are attempting to sleep in the miniature cabin in bunk beds.  The little space is crowded with their trunks and luggage.  Merle can barely hang onto the bunk, the boat pitches so violently below. \nEXT. TRAIN TRACKS - MED. VIEW - DAY \nA train speeds across the countryside. \nINT. THE TRAIN - DAY \nInside the corridor, a porter advances, and knocks on the door of a stateroom.  A voice tells him to enter.  OUR VIEW enters with him as he carries a tray of lunch.  From this POV we see Michael Corleone sitting in the compartment. \nPORTER Mr. Paul? \nMICHAEL Yes. \nPORTER You ordered lunch? \nMICHAEL Put it right there. \nThe porter does so; as he places the tray down, he catches a glimpse of a second person in the compartment with Michael. \nHIS VIEW \nA very fierce, almost maniacal looking man, BUSSETTA.  He nods that the porter should leave. \nMICHAEL Thank you. \nThe porter takes his advice and leaves quickly, closing the door behind him. \nVIEW THROUGH THE WINDOW \nMichael and his mysterious companion have lunch together on the moving train. \nEXT. GULFSTREAM RACE TRACK IN MIAMI - HIGH FULL VIEW - DAY \nThe empty parking lot of the Gulfstream track, on an off- race day. \nCLOSER VIEW \nMichael sits behind the wheel of a nondescript late model car.  Bussetta sits in the rear. \nAnother car swings into the lot.  Michael starts his car, and pulls out of the lot; the second car following. \nNEW VIEW \nThis car pulls out and begins to follow them.  Michael glances back by adjusting the rear view mirror, and nods to Bussetta. \nROSATO We worked it all out beforehand. \nPENTANGELI Are we going to eat or what? \nROSATO Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club. \nPENTANGELI (sarcastically) Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine. \nROSATO You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do? \nPENTANGELI We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around. \nROSATO You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk. \nPENTANGELI Don't I look like I'm listening? \nROSATO We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him. \nPENTANGELI I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe. (one of his men) Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash. (to Rosato) And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me? \nROSATO We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu. \nPENTANGELI Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...? \nROSATO My lawyer went over this beforehand. \nPENTANGELI What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits? \nROSATO The same assurance we got from you. \nPENTANGELI What if I say shove it? \nROSATO Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs. \nPENTANGELI You want a war? \nROSATO We got no choice. \nPENTANGELI You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you. \nROSATO We got friends in the commission. \nPENTANGELI (getting angry) I'm talking about Italians! \nROSATO What about Michael Corleone? \nPENTANGELI He supports me. \nROSATO Maybe, yes... maybe no. \nOne of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian food. \nPentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he pushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's hands. \nPENTANGELI You drove old Pete Clemenza to his grave, Carmine; you and your brother.  Turning on him; trouble in his territories -- you and your demands.  I hold you responsible, just as though you shot him in the head.  And I ain't gonna let that go for long! \nPentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little tension between the bodyguards of the two factions. \nROSATO (O.S.) Hey, Five-Angels... \nHe gives him the arm. \nFrankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here and now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make their move out. \nEXT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY \nPentangeli gets into the car. \nPENTANGELI Nobody I hate calls me Five-Angels to my face! \nHe slams the door. \nEXT. PENTANGELI'S LONG BEACH ESTATE - DAY \nPart of the old estate of Don Corleone.  By now, the wall has been torn down, and the other houses sold off. \nHis car is parked; Pentangeli steps out, still angry over the confrontation.  As he approaches the house, he notices something strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard his house.  No one seems to want to tell him. \nPENTANGELI What's up? \nPentangeli glances over to the front door foyer. \nPENTANGELI'S VIEW \nThe strange and silent Bussetta, the man who now always travels with Michael. \nINT. PENTANGELI'S HOUSE - DAY \nPentangeli enters; he sees his WIFE, standing oddly in the hallway. \nPENTANGELI (Sicilian) What's this? \nWIFE Michael Corleone. \nPENTANGELI One Michael Corleone...Dove? \nWIFE (Sicilian) He's in your study. \nHe knows it is very very serious for Michael to be here in his home. \nHe automatically moves into his study. \nINT. PENTANGELI'S STUDY - DAY \nMichael stands quietly in the room.  This was once his father's study, although it is totally redecorated. Pentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don, and kisses his hand. \nPENTANGELI Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you. \nMICHAEL I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home? \nPENTANGELI Michael, yes, we was all relieved... \nMICHAEL (furious) In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys. \nHe's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as suddenly, he talks quietly, calmly. \nMICHAEL I want you to help me take my revenge. \nPENTANGELI Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you? \nMICHAEL I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers. \nPENTANGELI I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there. \nMICHAEL I want you to settle on their terms. \nPENTANGELI Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that. \nMICHAEL Trust me; do as I ask. \nPENTANGELI It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them? \nMICHAEL Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty? \nSANDRA (O.S.) She's gone, Tom. \nSandra has followed him into Michael's house. \nHAGEN What do you mean gone? \nSANDRA The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago. \nHAGEN (furious) Why didn't someone tell me! \nSANDRA I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on. \nHagen rushes out of the house. \nEXT. TAHOE LAWN - DAY \nHagen moves quickly out of Michael's house; moving across the lawn to the boathouse. \nHAGEN'S SON Hey, Dad! \nThis time he ignores the thrown ball, and moves directly to Rocco, who is by some men near the boathouse. \nHAGEN Rocco! \nROCCO I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport. \nHAGEN Goddamn it, where were you? \nROCCO I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that. \nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY \nThey enter the boathouse. \nHAGEN (to one of the men) Get me a Scotch and water. \nThe man hurries behind the bar. \nROCCO She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place. \nHAGEN (almost to himself) I can't let him down. \nHe swallows the drink down in several gulps.  And then looks up to his men watching him.  He's embarrassed to have shown such weakness. \nHAGEN All right, let me think a minute. \nRocco clears the men out. \nROCCO Me too, Tom? \nHAGEN Yeah, give me a minute. \nRocco gone, Hagen moves behind the enormous bar, and pours himself a giant drink.  He drinks that, and calms himself. \nHAGEN Oh Christ, Pop.  It was so good when you were alive.  I felt I could handle anything... \nEXT. VIEW FROM BOAT - FULL VIEW - DAY \nA beautiful coastal view of a tropical Caribbean city.  An extraordinary view, high buildings, palm trees, all set right on the bay. \nMED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL \non the cruiser, Bussetta a little distance away, watching, but never speaking.  The dark-skinned CAPTAIN of the cruiser keeps pointing repeatedly. \nCAPTAIN Habana, Habana. \nEXT. HAVANA STREET - MOVING VIEW - DAY \nMichael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making its way through the streets of Havana. \nCLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL \nlooking out the window. \nMICHAEL'S POV \nCrowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans walking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat, carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all of these street impressions, the city is booming with activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and pimps and little children begging in the streets. \nMED. VIEW \nThe big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is sitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in the back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry. The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away in Spanish. \nINT. HAVANA CASINO LOBBY - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT \nMichael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the hotel, done in Spanish style, apparently just recently completed.  He is approached by a thin, mousy man, SAM ROTH, who ushers him toward the casino entrance. \nSAM ROTH Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all? \nMICHAEL No, I'm fine. \nHe leads Michael into the main casino. \nSAM ROTH This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game. \nMICHAEL Very impressive. \nSAM ROTH Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us. \nCOHEN (appreciating Michael's status) Mr. Corleone. \nSam turns to Bussetta and extends his glad-hand. \nSAM ROTH Pleasure to meet you, I'm sure... \nHe gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT \nAn extremely tall, well-built Cuban, tanned and wearing an attractive mustache, LEON, in his middle forties, reads from a prepared paper.  His sentences are translated by a smaller man, standing to his rear. \nLEON (Spanish) Most respected gentlemen, allow me to welcome you to the City of Havana, the Republic of Cuba on behalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio Batista. \nTHE VIEW BEGINS TO MOVE along the various men gathered for this meeting. \nLEON (O.S.) I'd like to thank this distinguished group of American Industrialists, for continuing to work with Cuba, for the greatest period of prosperity in her entire history. Mr. William Proxmiro, representing the General Fruit Company... Messrs. Corngold and Dant, of the United Telephone and Telegraph Company; Mr. Petty, regional Vice-President of the Pan American Mining Corporation; and, of course, our friend Mr. Robert Allen, of South American Sugar.  Mr. Nash of the American State Department.  And Mr. Hyman Roth of Miami, and Michael Corleone of Nevada representing our Associates in Tourism and Leisure Activities. \nVIEW ON THE ENTIRE GROUP \nLeon pauses to take a drink of water.  Then proudly, he lifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see. \nLEON The President would like to take this opportunity to thank U T&T for their lovely gift: a solid gold telephone!  He thought all you gentlemen would care to take a look at it. \nHe hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides, and it is passed in turn to each of the men in attendance. \nCORNGOLD Your Excellency, perhaps you could discuss the status of rebel activity and how this may affect our businesses. \nMED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL \nHe receives the telephone, and glances at it before passing it on to Hyman Roth. \nLEON (O.S.) Of course.  The rebel movement is basically unpopular, and since July of 1958 has been contained in the Oriente Province, in the mountains of the Sierra Muestre. \nMichael passes the phone on to Roth. \nOPERATOR We have your call to Tahoe, Nevada, sir. \nMICHAEL Thank you. (click, click) Tom?  Tom, is that you? \nROCCO (O.S.) No, Tom's out of town.  This is Rocco.  Who is this? \nMichael is openly disturbed that Hagen is not there.  He hangs up without answering. \nEXT. NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - DAY \nTom Hagen steps out of a taxicab a bit tentatively, and then steps toward the door of a pleasant New England house.  He rings the bell and waits, hat in hand.  A moment later, the door opens, and Kay is standing there. \nKAY I'm not surprised to see you, Tom. \nINT. SMALL ROOM - NEW ENGLAND HOUSE - MED. VIEW - DAY \nOut to the yard, where we can see glimpses of little Anthony playing by himself. \nKAY (O.S.) I can't love a man like that; I can't live with him, I can't let him be father to my children.  Look. \nThe little boy, moodily by himself. \nVIEW ON KAY \nobviously moved. \nKAY He's not like a little boy... he doesn't talk to me; he doesn't want to play; he doesn't like other children, he doesn't like toys. It's as though he's waiting for the time he can take his Father's place. (almost in tears) You know what he told me when he was four years old.  He said he had killed his Grandfather... \nVIEW ON HAGEN \nlistening, calmly. \nKAY ... He said he had shot his Grandfather with a gun, and then he died in the garden.  And he asked me... he asked me, Tom, if that meant now his father would shoot him out of... revenge. (she cries) How does a four year old boy learn the word... 'revenge'? \nHAGEN Kay... Kay... \nVIEW ON KAY \nKAY What kind of a family is this... are we human beings?  He knows his Father killed his Uncle Carlo.  He heard Connie. \nHAGEN You don't know that's true.  But Kay, just for the sake of an argument, let's assume it is, I'm not saying it is, remember, but... What if I gave you what might be some justification for what he did... or rather some possible justification for what he possibly did. \nKAY That's the first time I've seen the lawyer side of you, Tom.  It's not your best side. \nHAGEN Okay, just hear me out.  What if Carlo had been paid to help get Sonny killed?  What if his beating of Connie that time was a deliberate plot to get Sonny out into the open? Then what?  And what if the Don, a great man, couldn't bring himself to do what he had to do, avenge his son's death by killing his daughter's husband?  What if that, finally, was too much for him, and he made Michael his successor, knowing that Michael would take that load off his shoulders, would take that guilt? \nKAY He's not the same as when I met him. \nHAGEN If he were, he'd be dead by now. You'd be a widow.  You'd have no problem. \nKAY What the hell does that mean?  Come on, Tom, speak out straight once in your life.  I know Michael can't, but you're not Sicilian, you can tell a woman the truth; you can treat her like an equal, a fellow human being. \nThere is a long silence. \nThen Hagen shakes his head; he can tell her no more. \nHAGEN If you told Michael what I've told you today, I'm a dead man. \nKAY When is it finally over?  I want it to be over before my baby is born. \nHAGEN I don't know.  I hope soon; but it's not over yet, and that's why you and the kids have to come back to me. \nHe looks at her; it's clear that he has been entrusted with her safety and her children's. \nHe is a kind, good man, and seems very nervous and overwrought. \nVIEW ON THE WINDOW \nLittle Anthony is pressing his face against the glass pane, as though he senses the adults are discussing something of importance to him. \nINT. TROPICANA HOTEL-CASINO - MED. VIEW - NIGHT \nThe Baccarat table.  Busy, hundred dollar bills being played. \nLOUDSPEAKER Mr. Corleone; Mr. Freddie Corleone, telephone please. \nPIT BOSS Not here. \nVIEW ON THE CRAP TABLES \nThe play is fast; pit boss presiding; but no sign of Fredo. \nLOUDSPEAKER Telephone for Mr. Corleone. \nANOTHER PART OF THE CASINO \nWe see Neri, ominous, presiding over the entire store.  He picks up a pit telephone. \nNERI He's backstage. (and hangs up disgustedly) \nINT. TROPICANA BACKSTAGE AREA - MED. VIEW - NIGHT \nFredo is entertaining two showgirls done up in feathers and what-have-you. \nFREDO C'mon, you got fifteen minutes before the finale!  I want to show you a trick with feathers. \nSTAGEHAND Phone for you. \nFREDO Don't go away; wait a minute. \nHe takes the phone; we can catch a VIEW of the show going on from the wings. \nFREDO (on the phone) Yeah.  Okay.  Who?  Mikey?  But... Si... si, caposco. (in Sicilian) Sure... how much?  I understand. Jesus, three million... I won't let you down.  Sure. \nHe hangs up thoughtfully. \nONE OF THE GIRLS Freddie; we still got twelve minutes before the finale! \nFREDO Yeah... some other time. \nEXT. NEW YORK BAR - DAY \nThere is a light rain.  Pentangeli steps out of his car; points to Willy Cicci. \nPENTANGELI Wait in the car. \nHe walks up the street, to the bar, where he is greeted by the tall, handsome Carmine Rosato.  They shake hands. Pentangeli looks in his hand. \nCLOSE VIEW \nRosato has put a crisp one hundred dollar bill in his hand, folded sharply in two. \nPENTANGELI What's this? \nROSATO That's a lucky C note for our new deal. \nHe puts his arm around Pentangeli, and they walk into the bar. \nINT. THE BAR - DAY \nThe bar is fairly empty; and very dark.  Pentangeli and Rosato step up to the bar; the bartender momentarily stops polishing glasses to pour a couple of drinks. \nROSATO We were all real happy about your decision, Frankie; you're not goin' to regret it. \nFREDO That's what I'm here for. \nMICHAEL Tonight I want to relax with you. The Senator from Nevada is here with some people from Washington. I want to show them a good time in Havana. \nFREDO Count on me; that's my specialty. \nMICHAEL I'd like to come along.  There's been a lot of strain, and I've been cooped up in this room for three days. \nFREDO Me and you, great!  Gimme an hour to wash my face and do my research and we'll have these Washington suckers right where you want 'em. (then a thought strikes him) Poor Frankie Five-Angels.  He always wanted to die in bed...with a broad. \nINT. ROTH'S SUITE - MED. VIEW - DAY \nMichael stands at Roth's door carrying the briefcase that Fredo had brought. \nA hotel DOCTOR takes Hyman Roth's blood pressure, while his wife waits nervously. \nDOCTOR (Spanish) You must not exert yourself; I will write out a prescription and come back tomorrow. \nHOTEL MAN He's going to write a prescription. \nROTH I want my own doctor; fly him in from Miami.  I don't trust a doctor who can't speak English. \nThe doctor is shown out.  Roth gestures to the hotel man, who also leaves.  Then he looks to his wife. \nROTH Honey, go down to the casino? \nTERRI If you feel better... \nROTH I do.  Play the Bingo game. \nThey kiss, and she leaves.  Also Bussetta and Ola remain. \nROTH My sixth sense tells me you have a bag full of money in your hand. \nOla locks the door; Michael nods, and opens the bag, spilling its contents on the card table. \nMICHAEL This doubles my investment. \nROTH Still no word of your courier? We'll find him.  But at least this will satisfy our friends here. You've been invited to the New Year reception at the Presidential Home. I understand your brother is here as well; I hope he'll come. \nMICHAEL Six million dollars in cash is a high price for a piece of a country in the middle of a revolution. \nRoth looks patiently at Michael, as though he were a child who hadn't minded the lesson that he had been taught over and over again. \nROTH You're a careful kid, and that's good.  But look.  An international dispatch on the wire service. American journalism, not propaganda. The government troops have all but eliminated the rebels.  All but their radio station. \nMICHAEL I've read it; I'm pleased that the government is doing so well.  As a heavy investor, I'm pleased.  How did the doctor find you? \nROTH Terrible.  I'd give twice this amount to take a piss without it hurting. \nMICHAEL Who had Frankie Pantangeli killed? \nROTH (taken a bit off-balance) Why...the Rosato Brothers. \nMICHAEL I know that; but who gave the go ahead. \nRoth glances to Ola; he is not a fool; he realizes Michael has begun to suspect him. \nMICHAEL I know it wasn't me...so that leaves you. \nROTH There was this kid that I grew up with; he was a couple years younger than me, and sort of looked up to me, you know.  We did our first work together, worked our way out of the street.  Things were good and we made the most of it.  During prohibition, we ran molasses up to Canada and made a fortune; your father too.  I guess as much as anyone, I loved him and trusted him. Later on he had an idea to make a city out of a desert stop-over for G.I.'s on the way to the West Coast. That kid's name was Moe Greene, and the city he invented was Las Vegas. This was a great man; a man with vision and guts; and there isn't even a plaque or a signpost or a statue of him in that town.  Someone put a bullet through his eye; no one knows who gave the order.  When I heard about it I wasn't angry.  I knew Moe; I knew he was headstrong, and talking loud, and saying stupid things.  So when he turned up dead, I let it go, and said to myself: this is the business we've chosen. I never asked, who gave the go ahead because it had nothing to do with business. \nHe regards Michael silently a moment. \nROTH (continuing) There's three million dollars on that table.  I'm going to lie down, maybe take a nap.  When I wake up, if it's still there, I'll know I have a partner.  If it's gone, then I'll know I don't. \nThe old man turns, and moves in his slippers, toward his bedroom. \nINT. THE CORRIDOR - DAY \nMichael closes the door, and moves down the hallway.  He is followed by Bussetta, who had waited in the corridor. \nMICHAEL (Sicilian) How sick do you think the old man is? \nBUSSETTA (Sicilian) He'll live longer than me. \nINT. TROPICOR NIGHT CLUB - VIEW ON THE SHOW - NIGHT \nA Havana extravaganza, with tall, beautiful showgirls done up in flamboyant, 'South-of-the-Border' Carmen Miranda costumes; the lead singer is a six foot blonde doing \"Rum and Coca Cola\" in that style.  Her name is YOLANDA. \nMED. VIEW \nAt a large round table, located in an obvious VIP section of the high, tropically draped room with living ferns and other tropical planting with artificial stars. \nMichael rises, to be introduced by Fredo to some conservative looking Senatorial types, including Senator Pat Geary of Nevada.  We notice Bussetta standing nearby. \nFREDO Does everyone know everyone, or nobody knows nobody.  Here, my brother, Michael Corleone... well, you know Senator Geary. \nGeary warmly shakes Michael's hand. \nSENATOR GEARY Good to see you, Mike; I'm glad we can spend this time together. \nFREDO This is Senator Payton from Florida; Judge DeMalco from New York... Senator Ream... Mr. Questadt from California, he's a lawyer with the Price-Control Administration.  And Fred Corngold of U T&T. \nThey all make themselves comfortable.  A waiter with a tray of drinks appears. \nFREDO Gentlemen... your pleasure?  Cuba Libres, Pina Coladas, you name it. \nSENATOR GEARY I'll take a Yolanda. \nLaughter. \nFREDO Later, later.  All those girls look like they're on stilts! \nThe various tropical drinks are distributed. \nSENATOR GEARY To a night in Havana! \nThey all join in. \nFREDO (aside to Michael) Jeeze, it's great you came along, Mike... You know, we've never spent a night out on the town together. I always thought you looked down on me for liking a good time. \nMICHAEL I never looked down on you, Fredo. You don't look down at a brother. \nINT. THE CASINO - NIGHT \nBy now the group has made its way into the casino.  Some of them are crowded around the crap table; Senator Geary is with the enormous and beautiful Yolanda, who barely speaks English.  There are other girls with some of the men; not with Michael, who gambles dollars while talking to Corngold. \nCORNGOLD Our information is that Castro is dead.  There are maybe a few hundred die-hards in the Sierra Muestra; but government troops are going to clean them out any day. \nJohnny Ola approaches Michael. \nOLA Mike, can I talk to you. \nMichael follows Ola toward the Baccarat table; a watchful Bussetta moves, a distance away, with them. \nOLA Listen, this Senator from Florida already has a hundred grand worth of markers on the table. \nWe can see Senator Ream at the table, making thousand dollar bets on the Bank. \nOLA They asked him to sign paper to take down the markers; but he got mad; told them to wait until he was finished. \nMICHAEL Let him gamble. \nCICCI The Corleone Family, Senator.  We called it, \"The Family.\" \nSENATOR (O.S.) What position did you occupy? \nCICCI At first, like everybody, I was a soldier. \nVIEW ON SENATOR KANE \nA thin, angular Baptist with a Mid-Western accent. \nSENATOR KANE What is that exactly? \nCICCI A button.  You know, Senator. \nSENATOR KANE No, I don't know, explain that exactly. \nCICCI When the boss says push the button on a guy, I push the button, see, Senator? \nThe Senators treat Cicci with a surface courtesy, as if he were a curious kind of animal, not really human.  Cicci reacts to this by being even more brutally forthright than he has to be, to show his contempt for what he considers a hypocrisy. \nThe VIEW ALTERS from Senator Kane to the Committee's attorney, Mr. Questadt. \nQUESTADT You mean you killed people at the behest of your superiors? \nCICCI That's right, counsellor. \nQUESTADT And the head of your family was Michael Corleone. \nCICCI Yeah, counsellor, Michael Corleone. \nSENATOR KANE Did you ever get such an order directly from Michael Corleone? \nCICCI No, Senator, I never talked to him. \nSENATOR SAVOY (very autocratic, deep South, gentlemanly man) There was always a buffer, someone in between you who gave you orders. \nCICCI Yeah, a buffer, the Family had a lot of buffers. \nEXT. THE TROPICANA IN VEGAS - MED. VIEW - DAY \nA limousine pulls up at a private area near the side of the hotel.  Michael exits the limousine followed by Hagen and Neri. \nMICHAEL Do you think they have somebody to back up Cicci? \nHAGEN No.  But if they do have somebody, you'll do three years for perjury if you give them so much as a wrong middle name. \nMichael smiles to him, but it's a cold, deadly smile. \nHAGEN Michael, take the Fifth all the way, that way you can't get into trouble. \nEXT. PRIVATE BALCONY OF CORLEONE APARTMENT AT TROPICANA - DAY \nA Corleone bodyguard waits outside on the balcony overlooking the pool area.  Through the translucent draperies, we see a grouping of me. \nINT. CORLEONE APARTMENT AT THE TROPICANA - DAY \nMichael, Hagen, Neri and Rocco are seated in this luxury in the hotel.  Michael sits in a comfortable chair in his apartment.  Neri comes and brings him a drink without asking, but Michael refuses it. \nMICHAEL Al, get me a wet towel.  Does Kay know I'm back? \nHagen nods. \nMICHAEL Did the boy get something from me for Christmas? \nHAGEN I took care of it. \nMICHAEL What was it, so I'll know. \nHAGEN A little care he can ride in with an electric motor. \nNeri comes around with a wet face towel, which Michael uses to cool his eyes.  He puts the used towel down on the table. \nMICHAEL Fellas, can you wait outside a minute? \nThey know what he means and leave the apartment, going out to the balcony where we can see them but they cannot hear. Only Hagen remains. \nMICHAEL Where's my brother? \nHAGEN Roth got out on a private boat. He's in a hospital in Miami.  Had a stroke but he's recovered okay. Bussetta's dead. \nMICHAEL I asked about Fredo? \nHAGEN The new government arrested him, held him for a couple of days with a lot of the other casino people, including Roth's brother, Sam.  The American Embassy arranged flights for citizens; I'm not sure, but I think he's somewhere in New York. \nMICHAEL I want you to reach Fredo.  I know he's scared, but have one of our people reach him.  Assure him that there will be no reprisals.  Tell him that I know Roth misled him. \nHAGEN My information is that Fredo thought it was a kidnapping.  Roth assured him nothing would happen to you. \nMICHAEL (indicating Rocco and Neri on the balcony) They can come in now. \nHAGEN Wait... there's something else. \nMICHAEL Alright. \nHagen pauses; doesn't know how to begin. \nMICHAEL (impatiently) Go on, tell me. \nHAGEN Kay had a miscarriage; she lost the baby. \nAfter a moment: \nMICHAEL Was it a boy or a girl? \nHAGEN Mike, at three and a half... \nMICHAEL What is it, can't you give me straight answers anymore! \nHAGEN It was a boy. \nMICHAEL And Kay...she's all right? \nHAGEN She took the Senate Investigation worse. \nMICHAEL Does she blame it on me?  The baby? \nHAGEN I don't know. \nEXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY \nThe first snow of the New Year has fallen; the trees are bare, and there is hush all over this part of the Sierras. Michael is driven in his car, looking out at the familiar sight of the home he has been forced to be away from. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL \nlooking out from his window.  The last time he had seen the estate it was warm, and the trees were full. \nMOVING VIEW \napproaching the great stone gates; closed.  The bodyguards are not readily visible, but they are there.  The iron gates are opened, and one of the men makes a simple nod of respect, as the car pulls in. \nNEW VIEW \nInside the estate, the private roads have been freshly plowed, and occasionally a worker will pause to watch the car as it passes. \nDON FRANCESCO (Sicilian) Have him come closer, I can't see very well. \nVito takes those several steps, so that he is standing right in front of the old man. \nVIEW ON DON FRANCESCO \nlooking up, squinting against the sun. \nDON FRANCESCO'S VIEW \nStrangely backlit, almost blurry image of the young man from America. \nDON FRANCESCO (Sicilian) What is your name? \nVITO (Sicilian) Vito Corleone. \nDON FRANCESCO (Sicilian) You took the name of this town, eh? What was your father's name? \nVITO (Sicilian) Antonio Andolini. \nCLOSE VIEW ON THE OLD MAN \nThe recognition of the name throws a shudder through him. It is as though he recognizes that this is the boy; the son of his old enemy, whom he had killed, and whose sons he had tried to wipe out.  The old man raises his feeble hands signalling his guard, and in his weak voice, he shouts: \nDON FRANCESCO (Sicilian) Kill him!  Kill him! \nBut he is too late; Vito steps forward. \nVITO (Sicilian) In the name of my Father, and my Brother... \nAnd uses the knife, ritualistically plunging it into the old man's belly, and then up to his throat, which is severed. \nVIEW ON TOMASINO \nhas drawn his pistol and quickly shoots one of the guards, helping Vito to escape back into the motor car. \nVIEW ON A GUARD \nraising his shotgun. \nVIEW ON THE MOTOR CAR \nJust as Tomasino is about to get into the car, the shotgun is fired, and he is hit in the legs. \nVito manages to pull him up into the car, and they make their escape. \nEXT. RAILROAD STATION IN CORLEONE - DAY \nSome of the townspeople have come bringing flowers and gifts for Vito and his family. \nHis wife is radiant with the flowers given her. \nThe train has arrived and the crowd shout \"Ciao, come back soon.\" \nTHE VIEW ALTERS \nrevealing his good friend Tomasino, waving from his wheelchair. \nVIEW ON VITO \nand his wife.  She holds up the baby Michael, and helps him wave his hand. \nINT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY \nSENATOR KANE (O.S.) Are you the son of Vito Corleone? \nMICHAEL Yes. \nSENATOR KING Did he use at times an alias?  Was this alias in certain circles GODFATHER? \nMICHAEL It was not an alias.  GODFATHER was a term of affection, used by his friends, one of respect. \nSENATOR WEEKLER (Senator from New York, very smooth, partly liberal, Tammany Hall) Let me agree with that.  Many of my constituents are Italian and have been honored with that certain friendship by my close Italian friends.  Up to this point before I have to leave this hearing to join my own committee, let me say, that this hearing on the Mafia is in no way a slur on the Italians by the Senate; nor is it meant to be; nor will I allow it to be.  Italian Americans are the hardest working, most law abiding patriotic Americans of our country.  It is a shame and a pity that a few rotten apples give them a bad name.  We are here to weed those rotten apples out of the vast healthy barrel of Italian Americans, who are one of the backbones of our country. \nThere is a pause for a while, while the New York Senator poses for the TV cameras and leaves the hearing so that he will not be associated with hearing the rough stuff. \nSENATOR KANE I'm sure we all agree with our esteemed colleague.  Now, Mr. Corleone, you have been advised as to your legal rights.  We have had testimony from a preceding witness who states you are head of the most powerful Mafia family in this country.  Are you? \nMICHAEL No. \nSENATOR KANE This witness has testified that you are personally responsible for the murder of a New York Police Captain in the year 1947 and with him a man named Virgil Sollozzo.  Do you deny this? \nMICHAEL I deny his every charge. \nSENATOR KANE Is it true that in the year 1950 you devised the murder of the heads of the Five Families in New York, to assume and consolidate your nefarious power? \nMICHAEL That is a complete falsehood. \nSENATOR KANE Is it true that you own a controlling interest in three of the major hotels in Las Vegas? \nMICHAEL That is not true.  I own some stock in some of the hotels, but only very small amounts.  I also own some American Telephone and IBM stock. \nMichael had checked this point with Hagen, before answering, and then once again after the answer. \nSENATOR ROGERS Why is it necessary for your counsel to advise you on that question? \nMICHAEL Senator, I've observed the head of General Motors before a Senate Committee, and his lawyer whispered in his ear.  That was not commented upon in the way you have just done. \nSENATOR KANE Mr. Corleone, do you have any hotel interests in the state of Arizona? Or any gambling interests in that state? \nMICHAEL I do not. \nSENATOR KANE Do you have interests or control over gambling and narcotics in the state of New York. \nMICHAEL I do not. \nA pause.  Silence, as the Chairman whispers something to his assistant. \nTom Hagen takes a paper out of his briefcase, and addresses the Chair. \nHAGEN Senator, my client would like to read a statement for the record. \nSENATOR KANE I don't think that's necessary. \nHAGEN Sir, my client has answered every question asked by this committee with the utmost cooperation and sincerity.  He has not taken that Fifth Amendment as it was his right to do, and which because of the extreme legal complexity of this hearing, counsel advised him to do. So, I think in all fairness this committee should hear his statement and put it in the record. \nSENATOR KANE Very well. \nAt this point Senator Rogers contemptuously walks out of the hearing room. \nMICHAEL (reading) In the hopes of clearing my family name, in the sincere desire to give my children their fair share of the American way of life without a blemish on their name and background I have appeared before this committee and given it all the cooperation in my power.  I consider my being called before this committee an act of prejudice to all Americans of Italian extraction. I consider it a great dishonor to me personally to have to deny that I am a criminal.  I wish to have the following noted for the record. That I served my country faithfully and honorably in World War II and was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross for actions in defense of my country.  That I have never been arrested or indicted for any crime whatsoever... that no proof linking me to any criminal conspiracy, whether it is called Mafia or Cosa Nostra or whatever other name you wish to give, has ever been made public.  Only one man has made charges against me, and that man is known to be a murderer, arsonist and rapist.  And yet this committee had used this person to besmirch my name.  My personal protest can only be made to the people of this country.  I can only thank God that in this country we have a legal system and courts of law to protect innocent people from wild accusation.  I thank God for our democratic due process of Law that shields me from the false charges made by this committee's witness.  I have not taken refuge behind the Fifth Amendment, though counsel advised me to do so.  I challenge this committee to produce any witness or evidence against me, and if they do not, I hope they will have the decency to clear my name with the same publicity with which they have now besmirched it.  I ask this without malice, in the interests of fair play. \nThe television cameras have documented this moment, as Hagen hands the document over to the committee lawyer. \nSENATOR ROGERS We are all impressed.  The committee will now recess over the weekend. However, it will continue Monday morning, at eleven a.m.  At that time, this committee will then produce a witness directly linking Mr. Corleone to the charges we have made.  And then, Mr. Corleone may very well by liable for indictments of perjury.  However, this document will be made a matter of record. \nEXT. ARMY POST - DAY \nAn army post somewhere in the East.  It is safely guarded. \nINT. HOUSE ON THE POST - DAY \nwhere Pentangeli is being held by his constant companions, the two FBI MEN. \nAt first his view is blocked.  Then he sees Michael and is a bit shamefaced, but still defiant. \nPENTANGELI'S POV \nMichael returns his glances without emotion.  Then the VIEW ALTERS, revealing the Sicilian. \nVIEW ON PENTANGELI \nHe is terror stricken; obviously he recognizes the man. \nVIEW ON HAGEN'S TABLE \nMichael and the Sicilian sit by Hagen, where they can stare directly at Pentangeli; he is frozen with fear. \nVIEW ON THE SENATOR \nNotices the tension in the room.  The Chairman commences: \nSENATOR KANE We have here a witness who will testify further on Michael Corleone's rule of the criminal empire that controls gambling in this country and perhaps in other countries.  This witness had no buffer between himself and Michael Corleone.  He can corroborate our charges on enough counts for this committee to consider a charge of perjury against Michael Corleone. (then he turns to Pentangeli) Your name please, for the record. \nPENTANGELI Frank Pentangeli. \nSENATOR KANE Were you a member of the Corleone Family?  Were you under the Caporegime Peter Clemenza, under Vito Corleone, known as the Godfather? \nThere is a long silence. \nVIEW ON PENTANGELI \nHe seems unable to speak. \nVIEW ON THE SICILIAN \ngazing at him. \nVIEW ON PENTANGELI \nPENTANGELI I never knew no Godfather.  I got my own family. \nSenator Kane is stunned.  The two FBI men are alert, their eyes searching the room for what has intimidated their witness at the last moment. \nSENATOR KANE Mr. Pentangeli, you are contradicting your confessions to our investigators; I ask you again, were you a member of a crime organization headed by Michael Corleone? \nPENTANGELI No.  I never heard of it.  I never heard of nothing like that.  I was in the olive oil business with his father a long time ago.  That's all. \nSENATOR KANE We have your confession that you murdered on the orders of Michael Corleone.  Do you deny that confession and do you know what denying that confession will mean to you? \nThe die is cast and like a good soldier, Pentangeli will go all the way now.  So he is brazen in his defiance of the Senator. \nPENTANGELI The FBI guys promised me a deal. So I made up a lot of stuff about Michael Corleone.  Because then, that's what they wanted.  But it was all lies.  Everything.  They said Michael Corleone did this, Michael Corleone did that.  So I said, \"Yeah, sure.\" \nHe makes a big grin to show how he has made fools of everybody. \nVIEW ON THE FBI AGENTS \nglancing around the room; their eyes have settled on the Sicilian.  One of them scribbles a note on a piece of paper, and passes it to the Committee lawyer.  Then in turn it goes to Senator Kane. \nSENATOR KANE Mr. Hagen, would you kindly identify to this committee that gentleman sitting on your right hand? \nHAGEN (coolly) Yes, sir.  His name is Vincenzo Pentangeli. \nSENATOR KANE Is he related to the witness? \nHAGEN He is, I believe, a brother. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL AND VINCENZO PENTANGELI \nThey wait with no expression. \nSENATOR KANE (to Vincenzo Pentangeli) Sir, I would like you to take the stand. \nVincenzo stares at him, uncomprehending.  There may just be a shadow of contempt.  He doesn't answer. \nHAGEN Sir, the gentleman does not understand English.  He would not in any case, take the stand.  He came, at his own expense, to aid his brother in his trouble.  He is not under any jurisdiction of our government and his reputation in his own country is impeccable. \nSENATOR KANE (furious) The witness is excused; take him out. \nThe guards and FBI Agents quickly remove Pentangeli, as everybody else in the room is required to sit still. \nHAGEN Senator Kane. \nSENATOR KANE This meeting is adjourned. \nHAGEN (rising and shouting) This committee owes an apology! \nSENATOR KANE The committee is adjourned until further notice. \nFor the first time, in the midst of the confusion, Hagen smiles.  A bitter, contemptuous smile. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL \nThe modest champion.  He rises and they take their leave. \nVIEW ON THE TWO FBI AGENTS \nThey watch the Corleone party as they exit. \nINT. WASHINGTON HOTEL CORRIDOR - DAY \nThe Corleone nurse is waiting, playing with the little girl MARY.  A distance away, the boy, Anthony, is standing by himself. \nINT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - WASHINGTON HOTEL - DAY \nThe door to Michael's suite opens; Rocco leans in. \nROCCO It's Kay. \nMichael is sitting in an easy chair; he seems to have difficulty with his eyes. \nMICHAEL On the phone? \nROCCO No, she's here. \nMichael rises, surprised.  Rocco steps back, and Kay enters. \nMICHAEL I had no idea... \nKAY I wanted to see you before you went back to Nevada.  Also, the children - Michael, they're here. \nMICHAEL Where? \nKAY In a minute.  They're outside with Esther.  I'm very happy for you... I suppose I knew that you're simply too smart for anyone ever to beat you. \nMICHAEL Why don't you sit down? \nKAY I'm not going to stay long; I can't. \nMICHAEL There are a lot of things I want to talk to you about.  Things I've been thinking about -- changes I want to make. \nKAY I think it's too late for changes, Michael.  I promised myself I wouldn't talk about it and I've gone and spoiled it. \nMICHAEL Why too late? \nKAY Tell me, Michael.  What really happened with Pentangeli? \nINT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY \nFriends, relatives; Francesca and her new husband, Gardner and their baby; Sandra Corleone; Teresa, her children; all the familiar faces of the family are present, quietly paying their respects to Mama. \nSome of the men can be seen in the kitchen, drinking wine, and talking in low voices. \nFredo is there, broken-hearted over the loss of his Mother; like some lost child with no friends. \nMED. VIEW \nMichael enters the room, followed by Connie, who tends little Mary and Anthony. \nHe approaches his brother, and then embraces.  Fredo breaks into tears. \nFREDO Christ, Mike.  Jesus Christ, Mike. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL \nembracing his brother, he glances up. \nVIEW ON NERI \nquiet, and deadly. \nEXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - MED. VIEW - DAY \nTom Hagen is talking in the distance to his wife, and one of his older sons; he kisses, and moves toward the boathouse. After crossing the lawn, he stops. \nVIEW ON SANDRA CORLEONE \nwaiting there; obviously wanting to talk to him.  He continues, and she walks with him. \nMOVING VIEW ON THE TWO \nas they cross toward the boathouse. \nSANDRA You're going to talk to him now. \nHAGEN Yes. \nSANDRA Will you tell him? \nHAGEN I don't know. \nShe stops him. \nSANDRA Tom, think of yourself for once. Don't let this opportunity slip through your fingers; don't do it. We're all trapped here, don't you see? \nHe continues past her, without answering her.  Continues up to the boathouse.  He stops before he enters. \nHAGEN'S VIEW \nFredo is sitting by the edge of the harbor with Michael's son Anthony; he is helping him with some fishing rig. \nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY \nlooking through the window at his son and brother.  Neri sits in the room, dressed informally. \nMICHAEL (without looking back) Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth? \nHAGEN I know he's in Israel. \nNERI (hands Hagen the paper) The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down. \nHAGEN (reading) He's going to try Panama... \nMICHAEL They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million. \nHAGEN His medical condition is reported as... \"terminal.\" \nMICHAEL He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years. \nHAGEN That plane goes to Miami... \nMICHAEL I want it met. \nHAGEN (understanding) Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI. \nMICHAEL I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible... \nHAGEN Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him. \nMICHAEL I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill... (he stops, then coldly) ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all? \nHAGEN Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere? \nMICHAEL They are everywhere! \nHAGEN I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down. (Michael begins to confuse him) Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer. \nMICHAEL I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas. \nHAGEN Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you. \nMICHAEL Good.  Then you're staying. \nHAGEN I'm staying. (he pauses...then, without being asked) Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that. (then he sits down, and opens his briefcase) Now, explain everything to me. \nEXT. THE HARBOR - DAY \nFredo sits with Anthony, with a silly-looking fishing hat on his head, covered with lure and flies. \nFREDO Anthony, ole buddy, your Uncle Fredo's gonna teach you how to catch the big fish.  You know, when I was a kid, I did this amazing thing.  I went out on a fishing trip; me and my brothers and my Pop, and no one could catch a fish except me.  And this was my secret: (confidentially) Every time I would put the line down I would say a \"Hail Mary\" and every time I said a \"Hail Mary\" I would catch a fish.  Now, when it's sunset, we're gonna go out on the lake, and we're gonna try it. \nINT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY \nThe guards step aside as Tom Hagen enters the foyer of the house.  He shows a court order to them and they lead him up the stairs where he knocks on the door. \nINT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY \nThere is a KNOCK at the door.  The two guards show Hagen in and Hagen presents the court order to one of the FBI men. \nHAGEN I think I prefer to see my client privately. \nPENTANGELI The room has a bug in it. \nHAGEN (to the FBI men) I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air. \nFBI MAN #1 This room is not bugged. \nHAGEN You have guards outside and the electric fence.  There's no security reason for not letting us talk in the yard. \nFBI MAN #1 Okay. \nThey pass out of the room. \nEXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY \nHagen and Pentangeli outside, by the electric fence.  They cannot be overheard.  Pentangeli takes out some cigars and offers Hagen one.  Hagen takes it and Pentangeli lights both their cigars.  They puff on them contentedly.  They are comfortable together, almost. \nHAGEN Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry. \nPENTANGELI Did my brother go back? \nAn exhausted Hyman Roth, ill-shaven, and in shirt-sleeves in taken into custody by a swarm of Customs, and FBI men.  They allow him to be photographed by press people; and television cameramen. \nFBI MAN Mr. Roth, we have to take you into custody. \nROTH Yes, I know. \nSome flashbulbs go off. \nREPORTER Can you give us your reaction to the High Court of Israel's ruling. \nROTH I am a retired investor on a pension, and I wished to live there as a Jew  in the twilight of my life... \nLAWYER Mr. Roth is not a well man; he's tired of running. \nROTH I'm an old man; at my age, it's too late to start worrying. \nREPORTER Is it true you are worth over three hundred million dollars, Mr. Roth? \nROTH I'm a retired investor, living on a pension... I came home to vote in the Presidential election, because they wouldn't give me an absentee ballot... \nThe newsmen and photographers all laugh, as the FBI men move him away. \nCLOSE VIEW \nOne of the newspapermen laughing we recognize to be Rocco Lampone. \nHe moves closer to Roth, and shoves his revolver right against his head, and in a second, on camera, assassinates Roth.  People scream, as Rocco attempts to run down the airport corridor, limping as he does. \nFBI men easily pick him off. \nFADE OUT. \nEXT.

Behind her, in the recreation room, we can see the tableau of Kay sitting on the couch, her little daughter Mary, between her knees, talking quietly about things we cannot hear.  Her son Anthony sits by himself, in another chair by the side of the room. \nMED.

Kay hugs her daughter, and kisses her many times. \nCONNIE You have to hurry; he's coming. \nKay puts her coat on; then stands, and reaches out for her son. \nKAY Anthony, kiss Mama goodbye. \nHe doesn't move. \nCONNIE (angrily) Anthony, you kiss your Mother goodbye! \nHe rises, and walks to her.  Hugs her lifelessly. \nMED. CLOSE VIEW \non Kay, kissing her boy. \nKAY Anthony, say goodbye; your Mama loves you. \nANTHONY Goodbye. \nShe restrains any tears; she has become too strong for tears. Kay starts to go; picks up Mary, kisses her, and starts to go. \nNEW VIEW \nShe steps out the kitchen door; then she cannot help herself. Crouches down, outside, and calls to her son. \nKAY Anthony, kiss me once. \nThen she looks up, and slowly rises. \nHER VIEW \nMichael has stepped into the dining room.  He seems older somehow; as though some sickness has taken more years away from him. \nVIEW ON KAY \nlooks at him; instinctively, she takes a step back. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL \nslowly steps toward her. \nVIEW ON KAY \nAnother step back; the door is still open. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL \nHe moves closer to the door; stops, looks at her.  And then closes it obscuring any view of her. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY \nIt is late fall -- most of the leaves have fallen on the grounds and there is quite a wind. \nMED.

We HEAR the MUSIC of time passing, of Michael, of the Godfather over these images. \nVIEW ON THE SWIMMING POOLS \nThey have not been used in several months; they are drained and the bottoms are mossy and dark. \nVIEW ON THE MAIN GATE \nLeaves blowing past it; we don't see the button men; only a hint of someone in the gatehouse. \nVIEW ON THE HOUSES \nSome of the houses have had the summer awnings taken down, and put away.  Some of the windows have been boarded up. \nVIEW ON THE KENNELS \nThere are still the guard dogs; some sleeping, some moving impatiently. \nAs the MUSIC concludes its statement. \nMED. VIEW \nThe peninsula of the private Corleone Harbor.  We see the figures of two people, seated at a table. \nMED. VIEW \nMichael sits at a table having a sparse lunch.  He is attended by his sister Connie, who seems to be the closest person now living on the estate with him.  We see from the way she pampers him with his lunch, that she has fallen into the role of a surrogate Mother-Wife.  He seems older than his years, as though his illness, diabetes, has taken its toll. \n", "test1_input": "NERI (to the staring performers) Keep it going. \nEXT. A STREET IN BUFFALO, NEW YORK - NIGHT \nThe neon lights that spell out \"FRED'S PIZZERIA\" go out; after a moment a man in an overcoat steps out, and turns to lock the door of his restaurant.

He picks up a stick, and throws it for the dogs; who go scampering after it. \nWe notice that a respectful distance away, there are bodyguards watching every move he makes. \nCLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL \nlooking across the lake.  There is much on his mind.  The SOUND of the waltz, begins to segue into the echoed music and laughter of an old Italian Music Hall from the past. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. NEW YORK THEATRE - 1915 - NIGHT \nVITO CORLEONE is a shy young man of 23, holding his hat in his hand, being led down the crowded aisle of this Italian Vaudeville theatre by an energetic and fulfilled GENCO ABBANDANDO, his friend in America.  This entire sequence is played in Sicilian. \nGENCO Come on, you've got to see her! \nVIEW ON THE STAGE \nA tattered melodrama is in progress in Neapolitan.  The sets are two-dimensional, and flap whenever there's an entrance or exit. \nThe hero, PEPPINO, is weeping as he sings about how he's left his Mother in Italy, while he is in this new country, America. \nVIEW ON THE AUDIENCE \nAll poor, Italo-Americans.  Genco finds a few seats, and leads Vito to them, stepping on a few shoes in the process. They have barely come to their seats, when an excited Genco nudges Vito, and points to the stage.  People shout that they should sit down. \nVIEW ON THE STAGE \nThere is a knock on the door, and a young girl enters, delivering a letter to Peppino in his tenement in America. The girl is pretty; and obviously the object of Genco's affection.  The letter brings bad news.  Peppino's Mother is dead.  He weeps, and sings the final song, which most of the audience knows: SENZA MAMMA. \nVIEW ON THE AUDIENCE \nGenco is enthralled with the young actress.  The people in the audience are singing along with Peppino. \nVIEW ON THE STAGE \nThe actress, object of Genco's affection, makes a dramatic exit. \nVIEW ON THE AUDIENCE \nGenco pulls on Vito's jacket, indicating that now that his love is offstage, they should leave.  Vito rises with him, and they make their way all the way down the aisle. \nINT. BACKSTAGE THEATRE - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT \nGenco hurrying down the backstage corridor, hoping to catch a glimpse of the actress.  He is followed by Vito.  Suddenly, Genco stops short. \nGENCO'S VIEW \nA heavy-set, fierce looking Italian wearing an expensive light-colored suit and a cream colored fedora.  This is FANUCCI.  He is discussing a business matter with the theatre IMPRESARIO; a large, strong looking man, who is sweating nonetheless.  He doesn't seem to be giving in to Fanucci.  He holds a locked strongbox. \nVIEW ON VITO \nwatching.  The two men argue in Italian. \nMED. VIEW \nThe young ACTRESS crosses into the area, unaware of the difficulties.  The impresario sees her, and frightened, motions that she should keep away. \nIMPRESARIO Carla! \nBut Fanucci grabs her easily by her slender wrist, and with lightning speed, produces a knife which he holds against her cheek.  The impresario wrings his hands in agony. \nIMPRESARIO (Sicilian) No...please, not my daughter. \nWhereupon he begins to unlock the box which holds the receipts for the night's box-office. \nVIEW ON GENCO AND VITO \nhiding, watching.  At first, Genco is enraged, as though he would rush up to help his enamorata. \nGENCO (Sicilian) The Black Hand. \nThen he backs away.  Vito looks at him shocked and disappointed in this cowardly behavior.  Genco shakes his head, and points, as though to say that where Fanucci is concerned, there is nothing to be done. \nGENCO (Sicilian) (whispered) Let's get out of here. \nVIEW ON FANUCCI \nhas released the girl.  Her father pulls her away from him, and slaps her for no reason; then he pays Fanucci. \nFANUCCI (Sicilian) Because you protested, it will cost a hundred more. \nEXT. NEW YORK ALLEY - NIGHT \nGenco and Vito; Genco leans against the wall, breathlessly, as though he's had a near escape. \nGENCO (Sicilian) I know what you are thinking, Vitone, but you don't understand yet how things are.  Fanucci is of the Black Hand.  Everyone in the neighborhood pays him, even my father. \nVITO (Sicilian) He's an Italian? \nGENCO (Sicilian) A pig of a Neaponitan. (spits) \nVITO (Sicilian) Why?  Why does he bother other Italians? \nGENCO (Sicilian) Because he knows them; he knows they have no one to protect them. Vitone?  What do you think of my angel? \nVITO (Sicilian) Beautiful. \nGENCO (Sicilian) Beautiful. \nVITO For you, she is beautiful.  For me, there is only my wife! \nGENCO I know.  That's why I brought you with me! \nGenco embraces his good friend, and they laughingly walk down the alley. \nThe stage door opens, and Fanucci exits, a sinister figure in white, moving down the alley just in front of them, into the night. \nThe two friends hold their breath, until he disappears. \n", "test1_true": "Vito moves through the street, carrying groceries that he is to deliver. \nIt is cold, and so vendors are huddled around fires they have lit in old cans and drums. \nHe turns up an alleyway, and then stops. \nVIEW UP THE ALLEY \nWith great strength, Fanucci lifts one of them up into the air and throws him down hard to the concrete; but another, holding onto his back, manages to produce a switchblade knife and awkwardly reaching around from behind the moving man, slits Fanucci's throat from one side to the other. \nFanucci groans like some great hurt animal.  Blood pours from the deep, smile-like slit in his throat. \nHe throws the young man off his back. \nVIEW ON VITO \nstepping back in the alley. \nVIEW ON FANUCCI \nHe takes off his white fedora, and runs down the alley toward Vito, catching the flowing blood in his hat. \nThe young attackers scurry off in various directions. \nINT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY STORE - DAY \nA tiny shop featuring imported food: trays of cured meats, prosciutto, copagole, mortadella lies on the counter covered with netting to keep away the thousands of flies. \nOlive oil is sold in bulk, as well as wine, cheese and bacala. \nGenco works here for his father, and is busy slicing paper thin prosciutto for a customer, by hand.  Vito works in the back as a stock clerk. \nFinished with his customer, Genco moves to his friend. \nGENCO (Sicilian) I bet you can't guess what happened? \nVITO (Sicilian) What? \nGENCO (Sicilian) Some guys from Ninth Avenue jumped Fanucci today; slit his throat from ear to ear. \nVITO (Sicilian) No, I didn't know.  Is he dead? \nGENCO (Sicilian) Nah.  Those guys aren't murderers. They wanted to scare him, that's all.  Make him look bad. \nVITO (Sicilian) In Sicily, when you attack a man, you had better finish him. \nGENCO (Sicilian) I wish they had.  He takes fifty dollars a week from my father's cash drawer.  But you can't kill a man like Fanucci. \nVITO (Sicilian) Why? \nGENCO (Sicilian) Because he's what we say... \"connected\"... You wait, see what happens to those guys from Ninth Avenue. \nA customer enters; and Genco moves away to serve him. \nCLOSE VIEW ON VITO \nrecalling what he had seen and thought. \nEXT. NEW YORK ALLEYWAY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT \nA young man, one of those who had tried to kill Fanucci, runs down an alleyway, breathlessly.  Then he stops, and looks behind himself.  Whoever was following him is gone. He turns and walks ahead.  Then the mammoth, white-suited figure of Fanucci leaps down before him from the fire-escape. He grins at the young man, and then raises his neck, showing the gruesome wound that marks his throat. \nHe takes out his pistol and fires point-blank at his attacker. \nINT. TINY TENEMENT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT \nThe very small, railroad type flat where Vito lives with his new family. \nIt is late at night, and he is exhausted. \nHe returns home; where his young wife, CARMELLA, goes through the silent ritual of preparing a simple meal for him. He sits and eats quietly. \nINT. TENEMENT ROOM - NIGHT \nVito and Carmella enter the darkened bedroom, and approach a metal crib.  Vito reaches down and takes the small hand of the baby between his thick peasant fingers.  Carmella waits a respectful distance behind him. \nINT. ABBANDANDO GROCERY - DAY \nThe shop bell RINGS; SINGER ABBANDANDO turns to see a smiling Fanucci tipping his hat, like an old customer. \nFANUCCI Buon giorno. \nImmediately, Vito turns back to his work, and Signor Abbandando moves to Fanucci with a sigh. \nVito notices the two men talking quietly at one side of the store, while he goes about his work.  Genco works his way closer to his friend. \nGENCO (Sicilian) What did I tell you.  The one who cut him was found in an alley.  And the family of the others paid Fanucci all their savings to make him forswear his vengeance. \nVITO (Sicilian) (surprised) And he agreed? \nGENCO (Sicilian) He took the money.  Now he wants double from everybody in the neighborhood, including Papa. \nVito watches the heated, but inevitable transaction. \nVITO (Sicilian) (almost to himself) A real mafioso doesn't sell his vengeance. \nMED. VIEW \nSignor Abbandando seems to be arguing with Fanucci, and every so often they turn and relate to where Vito is working. Then Fanucci leaves, the little bell RINGING; and Signor Abbandando reluctantly moves to Vito. \nSIG. ABBANDANDO (Sicilian) Vitone.  How is your son? \nVITO (Sicilian) We are all well. \nIt is clear that he has something difficult to tell the young man. \nSIG. ABBANDANDO Vitone...I...Fanucci has a nephew. \nVito looks at him a while, as the old man struggles to tell him. \nVITO (Sicilian) And you must give him my job. \nThe old man nods, regretfully. \nVITO (Sicilian) You have been kind to me since I was a boy; taken care of me, and been as a father.  I will always be grateful to you.  Thank you. \nVito takes off his apron, and leaves, passing the youth who loiters by the counter. \nEXT. THE STREET - DAY \nmaking his way from the store. \nSIG. ABBANDANDO (Sicilian o.s.) Vitone! \nHe turns, and Abbandando has followed him out of the shop, holding a basket of some groceries. \nSIG.

Hyman Roth, not Pentangeli. \nFREDO But, you told me yourself... \nMICHAEL It was never Pentangeli... I've always known that.  It was Roth all along.  He talks to me as a son; as his successor, but the old man thinks he'll live forever. \nFREDO What do you want me to do? \nMICHAEL To go tonight, with me, as though we know nothing.  I've already made my move. \nFREDO What is it?

PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT \nWe see evidence of the confusion at this late hour; already cars are beginning to move; people leaving the Palace in haste.  Michael moves quickly toward his car.  He sees Fredo, watching him in fear. \nMICHAEL Come with me.  It's your only way of getting out! \nVIEW ON FREDO \nTerrified of his brother, and what he knows; Fredo backs away into the growing noise and confusion of the crowd. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL \nFinally, he has to step into the car and it roars off. \nEXT. HAVANA STREETS - NIGHT \nRebel cars with loudspeakers have already picked up the news that Batista has conceded...this throws the crowds already gathered for the New Year into cheers of joy. \nThey harass a wealthy family who are trying to get away in their car. \nThe people pull them out of the car, opening their suitcases, out of which spill piles of cash and jewelry into street. \nMichael's car makes its way as the crowd cheers: \"El animale se fue!\" \nEXT. THE UNITED STATES EMBASSY - MED. VIEW - NIGHT \nCrowds of panicked and frightened tourists, and Batistianos are trying to get to the safety of the Embassy with the families and possessions. \nWe see Geary, and some of the Americans we had met, working their way through the crowds, shouting that they are Americans in order to get preference on the line.  Often that declaration brings 'boos' from the crowds. \nSometimes the joyous Cubans will let a family through, but again, taking away the suitcases, rich leather, filled with money and valuables.  Money seems to be stuffed everywhere. \nEXT. THE YACHT CLUB - NIGHT \nAll forms of private transportation are jammed with people trying to get out, holding cash in their hands for anyone with a yacht or small boat to get them to Florida. \nA car pulls up; and we see Sam Roth, Terri Roth and some of their men, carry the sickly, but still alive Hyman Roth to a private cruiser which is protected by men with machine guns. \nWithin seconds, they are on their way to Miami. \nEXT. THE PRIVATE AIRPORT - NIGHT \n", "test2_id": 2299, "test3_input": "Things are no different at the airport; where anything that can fly is being jammed with refugees and their money. \nA wealthy family is arguing with the pilot of a fast airplane; trying to force cash on him, and his family into the plane.  The PILOT steadfastly refuses, although checking his watch, as though his passengers are late.  He speaks only English. \nPILOT No, this is a private plane.  No, this plane is taken. \nFinally Michael's Mercury pulls up, and Michael approaches the Pilot. \nMICHAEL He isn't here. \nPILOT We've got to leave, they'll take this thing apart. \nMICHAEL All right.  Go now. \nThe Pilot lets Michael in, as the Cuban screams curses at them, and begins searching for another plane for his family. \nINT. THE PLANE - VIEW ON THE PILOT - NIGHT \nas the propeller turns over. \nEXT. THE AIRPORT - FULL VIEW - NIGHT \nGroups of the cheering, celebrating Cubans sing \"Guantanamera,\" now as a song of triumph. \nINT. THE PLANE - MOVING VIEW - MICHAEL - NIGHT \nCloser to him, his personal and business life caught in the middle of history. \nEXT. NEW YORK STREET - MED. VIEW - DAY (1920) \nHe stops to pick out some choice oranges and peaches from a fruit stand.  Then he reaches into his pocket for change. \nVENDOR No, no.  It is my pleasure to make this a gift. \nCLOSE VIEW ON VITO \nVITO You are kind.  If ever I can do something for you, in return, please come to me. \nINT. VITO'S TENEMENT - DAY \nDespite his new position of 'respect,' there is little changed about his home.  Only that they have lived there a while now, and the rooms are fuller with the inevitable possessions a young family acquires. \nHe kisses his wife, who seems a big apprehensive.  He shows her the fruit; and from her reaction knows she has something on her mind. \nVITO (Sicilian) What is it? \nCARMELLA (Sicilian) Come... \nThey step into the tiny parlor, where we see an older woman, waiting nervously. \nCARMELLA The Signora is a friend of mine. She has a favor to ask of you. \nVITO (Sicilian) Why do you come to me? \nSIGNORA COLOMBO (Sicilian) She told me to ask you. \nHe seems surprised; looks to his wife. \nCARMELLA She is having some trouble.  Her landlord has received complaints because of her dog.  He told her to get rid of it, but her boy loved it, so they tried to hide it.  When the landlord found out, he was so angry, he ordered her to leave. Even if she truly will let the dog go. \nSIGNORA COLOMBO (Sicilian) He said he would have the police put us out. \nVITO (thoughtfully) I can give you some money to help you move, is that what you want? \nSIGNORA COLOMBO My friends are all here; how can I move to another neighborhood with strangers?  I want you to speak to the landlord to let me stay. \nVito nods to the frightened old woman. \nVITO It's done then.  You won't have to move; I'll speak to him tomorrow morning. \nCarmella breaks into a smile; which her husband des not acknowledge. \nThe old woman starts to leave the room; but she is not convinced. \nSIGNORA COLOMBO You're sure he'll say yes, the landlord? \nVITO I'm sure he's a good-hearted fellow. Once I explain how things are with you, I'm sure he'll take pity on your misfortunes.  Don't let it trouble you any more. (as he shows her out) Guard your health, for the sake of your children. \nEXT. TENEMENT BLOCK - DAY \nSIGNOR ROBERTO, a pompous, rather well-dressed Patrone angrily walks down the steps of one of his tenement buildings. \nHe carries a check list, and makes marks with a pencil concerning the condition of his various buildings; a broken window here, some missing tile there.  He bends over to pick up some garbage left by a thoughtless tenant, muttering to himself, when he sees the shoes and legs of a young worker. \nVITO (O.S.) Signore Roberto... \nHe rises to be face to face with a polite Vito Corleone. \nVITO The friend of my wife, a poor widow with no man to protect her, tells me that for some reason she has been ordered to move from your building.  She is in despair.  She has no money, she has no friends except those that live here. \nSignor Roberto brusquely answers, and continues on his way. \nROBERTO I have already rented the apartment to another family. \nMOVING SHOT ON THE TWO \nVITO I told her I would speak to you, that you are a reasonable man who acted out of some misunderstanding. She has gotten rid of the animal that caused all the trouble, so why shouldn't she stay.  As one Italian to another, I ask you the favor. \nROBERTO I've already rented it; I cannot disappoint the new tenants.  They're paying a higher rent. \nVITO How much more a month? \nROBERTO Eh... (we sense he is lying) Five dollars more. \nVito reaches into his pocket, and takes out a roll of bills. \nVITO Here is the six month's increase in advance.  You needn't speak to her about it, she's a proud woman.  See me again in another six months. But of course, you'll let her keep her dog. \nROBERTO Like hell!  And who the hell are you to give me orders.  Watch your manners or you'll be on your Sicilian ass in the street there. \nVito raises his hands in surprise; his voice is reasonable. \nVITO I'm asking you a favor, only that. One never knows when one might need a friend, isn't that true?  Here, take this money as a sign of my good-will, and make your own decision.  I won't quarrel with it. (he puts the money in Roberto's hand) Do me this little favor, just take it and think carefully.  Tomorrow morning if you want to give me the money back, by all means do so.  If you want the woman out of your house, how can I stop you?  It's your property, after all.  If you don't want the dog in there, I can understand.  I dislike dogs myself. (he pats Roberto on the shoulder) Do me this service, eh?  I won't forget it.  Ask your friends in this neighborhood about me, they'll tell you I'm a man who believes in showing his gratitude. \nWithout a word more, Vito leaves a hypnotized Roberto standing in front of the tenement, his hand clasping the money. \nEXT. NEIGHBORHOOD STREET - DAY \nA thin young man, almost gawky, walks down the street in this Italian neighborhood, his name is HYMAN SUCHOWSKY. \nHe carries his tools as he comes home from work.  He is pursued and tormented by a couple of Italian youths, about his own age, eighteen. \nITALIAN BOY Kid, where do you live? \nANOTHER Where'd you get those nigger lips? \nHe tries not to be intimidated; finally one of the boys, steps in front of him and stops him. \nITALIAN BOY Say 'bread' in Italian. \nANOTHER He dunno. \nITALIAN BOY Go on; how do you say 'bread' in Italian?  If you're from the neighborhood, you should know how to say 'bread' in Italian. \n", "test3_true": "CLEMENZA What's up? \nITALIAN BOY This kid lives around here, but he can't say bread in Italian. \nCLEMENZA That's 'cause he's Jew.  Look at those pregnant lips! \nHe giggles at his own joke. \nITALIAN BOY Are you a Jewboy? \nThe boy doesn't answer, tries to keep going. \nITALIAN BOY Well, if you're not a Jew, say 'bread' in Italian.  See, he can't. \nAnd with that, he rounds a blow squarely to the boy's face, sending him sprawling to the cement, his tools flying with a clatter. \nThe other Italian immediately joins in with a few kicks to the boy's stomach.  Hyman tries to fight back; grabs a hold of his tormentor's foot, and brings him down on the cement as well.  For a moment, they are rolling around on the sidewalk, two against one, Hyman taking the worst of it. \nCLEMENZA Alright, alright, cut it out. \nSECOND ITALIAN What for?  He killed Jesus Christ! \nClemenza pulls him off, and kicks him in the ass. \nCLEMENZA I said cut it out! (to the beaten kid) What's your name? \nHYMAN Hyman Suchowsky. \nITALIAN BOY I don't believe it.  In our neighborhood, with a name like that! \nCLEMENZA What are those tools?  You work on cars? \nHYMAN Yeah. \nCLEMENZA Maybe I know how you can make a couple of extra bucks working as a mechanic. \nThe boy seems agreeable. \nCLEMENZA But you gotta know how to keep your mouth shut, and fer Chrissakes, get rid of that name.  I'll call you Johnny Lips. (he giggles at his own humor again) Come on... \nHe leads the boy down the street, whispering to him, on the side: \nCLEMENZA Bread in Italian is pane.  P-A-N-E, pane.  Don't forget. \nINT. NEW GENCO WAREHOUSE - DAY \nA newly acquired warehouse, stocked with cases of the new product \"GENCO PURA\" olive oil.  It is the beginning of a new business, in the American tradition.  Now they have one rattling old truck, and a few stock boys. \nGenco has become the accountant-business manager, based on the experience working with his father.  But it is clear, that Vito is the leader, and undisputed 'President' of the new enterprise. \nGenco moves through the darkness of the warehouse, to the small divided area that Vito uses as his office. \nGENCO (Sicilian) The 'patrone' is here. \nVITO Chi? \nGENCO Roberto.  Who owns the 'rat-holes.' \nVito nods that he will see him; and soon Roberto enters, on tiptoe, his hat in his hand, and in a apologetic voice. \nROBERTO Excuse me, I hope I am not a disturbance, Don Corleone. \nVITO Yes. \nROBERTO What a terrible misunderstanding. Of course, Signora Colombo can stay in the flat.  Who were those miserable tenants to complain about noise from a poor animal...when they pay such low rent. \nThen abruptly, he puts the roll of money on Vito's table, and steps back a respectful distance. \nROBERTO Your good heart in helping the poor widow has shamed me, and I want to show that I, too, have some Christian charity.  Her rent will remain what it was. \nVITO What was that? \nROBERTO In fact, reduced, bu five dollars! \nVito embraces him warmly. \nVITO I accept your generosity... \nROBERTO I won't keep you another minute... \nHe quickly takes his leave, bowing several times, and then makes it back to the safety of the warehouse; he sighs, deflates his lungs, and mops his brow; his bones have turned too jelly with fear at his narrow escape.  He all but runs out of the warehouse. \nGenco laughs as he watches. \nGENCO We won't see him for weeks!  He'll stay in bed in the Bronx! \nClemenza has been waiting with his new mechanic.  We notice the subtle difference in the way he treats Vito.  He is no longer a junior apprentice in their petty crimes; but an imposing leader. \nCLEMENZA This kid is good with cars; he kiijed at the truck, and says he can keep it going. \nVito looks over the lanky young man. \nCLEMENZA What's your name? \nHYMAN Suchowsky.  Hyman Suchowsky. \nCLEMENZA He's gonna dump that; I call him Johnny Lips. \nVITO Who is the greatest man you can think of? \nCLEMENZA Go on, answer him when he talks to you.  Tell him: Columbus, Marconi... Garibaldi. \nHYMAN Arnold Rothstein. \nVITO Then take that as your name: Hyman Rothstein. \nGenco is out in the alley; he calls out with glee. \nGENCO Vitone!  Look at this! \nVito moves out to the smiling Genco; Clemenza and the newly christened Hyman Rothstein follow a distance behind. \nEXT. THE ALLEY - DAY \nGenco stands beaming, as two workers raise up high, the freshly painted sign: \"GENCO OLIVE OIL COMPANY.\" \nGENCO (enthusiastically) God bless America!  We're in business! \nThe young men watch as the sign is hoisted into place.  OUR VIEW goes from one to the other: Clemenza, Genco, Vito and Hyman Rothstein. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. SENATE CAUCUS ROOM - MED. CLOSE VIEW - DAY \nWilly Cicci, Pentangeli's associate and bodyguard takes a drink of water. \nSENATOR (O.S.) Mr. Cicci.  From the year 1927 to the present time, you were an employee of the \"Genco Olive Oil Company.\" \nCICCI That's right. \nSENATOR (O.S.) But in actuality, you were a member of the Corleone Crime organization. \n", "test3_id": 2300}

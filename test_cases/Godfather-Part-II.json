{"test1_input": "ROSATO We worked it all out beforehand. \nPENTANGELI Are we going to eat or what? \nROSATO Sure, on me.  I got Diner's Club. \nPENTANGELI (sarcastically) Forget it; I'm suddenly without an appetite.  You're making big trouble, Carmine. \nROSATO You weren't straight with us, Frankie, what else could we do? \nPENTANGELI We could have talked first, saved a lot of running around. \nROSATO You wasn't listening, you didn't want to talk. \nPENTANGELI Don't I look like I'm listening? \nROSATO We want Brooklyn one hundred percent.  No more taxes to you.  We want to be only loosely connected with your family -- sort of a under-family all of our own.  Then we can act on all internal matters without talking.  Also we want you to inform Michael Corleone that we can deal directly with him. \nPENTANGELI I'm a little hungry, maybe I'll order something.  Joe. (one of his men) Get me some bracciole or something. And pay cash. (to Rosato) And in return for these concessions, what do you do for me? \nROSATO We will release the hostages, number one.  Number two, we're here for you to count on when you need us.  We're independent, but we're here if you need us.  In general, we'll cooperate with you and your businesses, and you in turn will cooperate with us.  Pari persu. \nPENTANGELI Pari Persu; what the fuck is Pari persu...? \nROSATO My lawyer went over this beforehand. \nPENTANGELI What assurances do I have that there will be no more kidnapping, no more hits? \nROSATO The same assurance we got from you. \nPENTANGELI What if I say shove it? \nROSATO Then Carmine Fucillo and Tony Blue DeRosa will need to be fitted for slabs. \nPENTANGELI You want a war? \nROSATO We got no choice. \nPENTANGELI You know if there's a way I'll go to the commission and the commission will side with me.  That puts me and the other New York families against you. \nROSATO We got friends in the commission. \nPENTANGELI (getting angry) I'm talking about Italians! \nROSATO What about Michael Corleone? \nPENTANGELI He supports me. \nROSATO Maybe, yes... maybe no. \nOne of Pentangeli's men approaches with a plate of Italian food. \nPentangeli stands up, angered by this remark of Rosato's; he pushes the dish of food out of the surprised Bodyguard's hands. \nPENTANGELI You drove old Pete Clemenza to his grave, Carmine; you and your brother.  Turning on him; trouble in his territories -- you and your demands.  I hold you responsible, just as though you shot him in the head.  And I ain't gonna let that go for long! \nPentangeli walks out of the restaurant; there's a little tension between the bodyguards of the two factions. \nROSATO (O.S.) Hey, Five-Angels... \nHe gives him the arm. \nFrankie's face turns red, like he wants to have it out here and now; but Willy Cicci calms his down, and they all make their move out. \nEXT. THE RESTAURANT - DAY \nPentangeli gets into the car. \nPENTANGELI Nobody I hate calls me Five-Angels to my face! \nHe slams the door. \nEXT. PENTANGELI'S LONG BEACH ESTATE - DAY \nPart of the old estate of Don Corleone.  By now, the wall has been torn down, and the other houses sold off. \nHis car is parked; Pentangeli steps out, still angry over the confrontation.  As he approaches the house, he notices something strained about the bodyguards who discreetly guard his house.  No one seems to want to tell him. \nPENTANGELI What's up? \nPentangeli glances over to the front door foyer. \nPENTANGELI'S VIEW \nThe strange and silent Bussetta, the man who now always travels with Michael. \nINT. PENTANGELI'S HOUSE - DAY \nPentangeli enters; he sees his WIFE, standing oddly in the hallway. \nPENTANGELI (Sicilian) What's this? \nWIFE Michael Corleone. \nPENTANGELI One Michael Corleone...Dove? \nWIFE (Sicilian) He's in your study. \nHe knows it is very very serious for Michael to be here in his home. \nHe automatically moves into his study. \nINT. PENTANGELI'S STUDY - DAY \nMichael stands quietly in the room.  This was once his father's study, although it is totally redecorated. Pentangeli starts sweating, and moves toward the young Don, and kisses his hand. \nPENTANGELI Don Corleone, I wish you let me know you was coming.  We could have prepared something for you. \nMICHAEL I didn't want you to know I was coming.  You heard what happened in my home? \nPENTANGELI Michael, yes, we was all relieved... \nMICHAEL (furious) In my home!  In the same room where my wife was sleeping; where my children come in their pajamas, and play with their toys. \nHe's terrified Pentangeli with his anger; then, just as suddenly, he talks quietly, calmly. \nMICHAEL I want you to help me take my revenge. \nPENTANGELI Michael, anything.  What is it I can do for you? \nMICHAEL I want you to settle these troubles with the Rosato Brothers. \nPENTANGELI I was just going to contact you, Michael; we just had a 'sit-down' - in fact, I just come from there. \nMICHAEL I want you to settle on their terms. \nPENTANGELI Mike, I don't understand.  Don't ask me to do that. \nMICHAEL Trust me; do as I ask. \nPENTANGELI It would be the beginning of the end for my family.  How can I keep all my other territories in like if I let two wise-guys stand up and demand this and that, and then give it to them? \nMICHAEL Frankie...do you respect me?  Do I have your loyalty? \n", "test1_true": "MICHAEL I know. \nPENTANGELI Then why do you want me to lay down to them? \nMICHAEL (coldly, but convincing) Frankie, Roth tried to have me killed.  I'm sure it was him, but I don't know yet why. \nPENTANGELI Jesus Christ, Michael, then let's hit 'em now, while we still got the muscle. \nMICHAEL This was my father's old study. When I was a kid, we had to be quiet when we played near here. When I was older, I learned many things from him here.  I was happy that this house never went to strangers; first Clemenza took it over, and then you.  My father taught me, in this room, never to act until you know everything that's behind things.  Never.  If Hyman Roth sees that I interceded with you in the Rosato Brothers' favor, he'll think his relationship with me is still sound.  I'm going somewhere to meet him tomorrow.  We have friends in some very important business that we're making.  Do this for me; you make the peace with the Rosato Brothers on their terms.  Let the word out that I forced you; you're not happy wit hit, but acquiesced, just because of me.  It will get back to Hyman Roth.  Do this, Frankie.  You can trust me. \nPENTANGELI Sure, Mike.  I'll go along. \nMICHAEL Good. \nThey embrace; Michael kisses him.  He looks at the young Don, thoughtfully. \nINT. TROPICANA HOTEL - CLOSE VIEW - DAY \nThe money trays are carefully unloaded from the gaming tables, and put on a cart with others. \nThe cart, preceded and followed by security guards, is then wheeled through the casino, into a private, counting room. \nINT. COUNTING ROOM - MED. VIEW - DAY \nThe guards leave the room; the door is locked after them, leaving only Hagen.  Neri and an ACCOUNTANT, a very fat man. The numbered boxes are opened, and cash and checks are spread out on the counting table. \nThe accountant begins with amazing speed and skill, to count and divide the money. \nNERI Fifteen percent skim? \nHAGEN Twenty-five this time. \nThe accountant stops, and looks up to Neri. \nNERI It might show. \nHAGEN Mike wants it. \nNeri nods, and the accountant continues.  Neri opens a door, allowing a sandy-haired man, a COURIER, into the room.  The cream is placed into his pouch personally by Neri. \nNERI We've never sent this much with one courier. \nHAGEN (to the courier) Your plans are a little different this time.  You skip Miami, and go straight to Geneva.  It's to be deposited to this number. (handing him a small envelope) And it's got to be there by Monday morning, no slip-up. \nCOURIER I think I was 'picked-up' last trip. That hour layover I had at Kennedy. I went over and bought a paper... \nNeri has finished putting the 'creamed' money into the pouch. \nNERI Those were our people. \nCOURIER Okay, just thought you should know. \nHe is just about to close and lock the pouch, when Hagen gestures that he should wait, and adds more stacks of carefully packaged bills into the pouch.  Then Neri locks it, and handcuffs it to the courier's arm, looking inquiringly at Hagen. \nHAGEN Let them count. \nThe courier is shown out through a private door, and then the first door is opened.  Two accountants come in with the guards, and the trays are opened, and the counting process is begun all over again, this time with the State Tally sheets. \nINT. TROPICANA CORRIDOR - MOVING VIEW - DAY \nThe courier continues on his way; followed by Hagen and Neri. \nNERI What's up? \nHAGEN No questions. \nNERI I got to ask questions, Tom, there's three million dollars cash in that pouch; Mike is gone and I have no word from him. \nHAGEN Al, as far as you're concerned, I'm the Don. \nNERI How do I know you haven't gone into business for yourself? \nThis hurts Tom; but he is a reasonable man, and he knows he owes Neri some explanation. \nHAGEN You've been through a lot with us so I'm going to give you the truth. Mike knows it was someone within the compound that set him up for that hit.  So nobody is to know where he is, not you, not Rocco, not even his brother Fredo.  Sorry, Al, I know how you feel about Mike...but he still remembers Tessio. \nEXT. KEY WEST - NIGHT \nMichael is led to a desolate, night-lit private dock.  He is followed by the ever-present Bussetta, and they are helped onto a light-weight, luxury cabin cruiser.  The crew cast off various ropes, and the boat sets out into the night. \nFADE OUT. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. TAHOE ESTATE - DAY \nA seaplane lands nicely by the private Corleone harbor; Hagen disembarks with his inevitable overloaded briefcase. He continues down the ramp, past several Buttonmen, dressed in summer casual attire, and who resemble secret service men rather than thugs. \nHis wife THERESA lies on a blanket on the great lawn, with her youngest children, who run to their father for a kiss. \nTHERESA Hungry? \nHAGEN Just a little. \nTHERESA I've invited Mama, Sandra and the kids for barbecue. \nHAGEN What about Kay? \nTHERESA I couldn't find her.  She's been so broody, sticks to herself. \nEXT. TAHOE LAWN BARBECUE - MED. VIEW - DAY \nHagen and Sonny's boys are throwing a football around on the lawn; the littler kids running after them. \nCoals are burning in the old style stone barbecue, and several tables are set for the family. \nIn the distance, there is always evidence of the bodyguards. \nTheresa, Mama and Sandra prepare the steaks. \nHagen relaxes in a sports shirt. \nHAGEN Let me try Kay. \nHe crosses the lawn, to the house on the beach where Michael and his family live.  Is about to knock on the door: \nHAGEN'S SON Hey, Pop, heads up! \nThe football is flying in his direction; he catches it and throws it back.  Then he cracks the door open, and peeks in. \nINT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY \nHAGEN Kay? \nHe steps in, the beautiful summer living room is neat, but empty. \nHAGEN Anyone hungry? \nHe moves through the house more quickly; into the dining and recreation room areas.  A cat jumps off a pile of cushions and runs across the room. \nHAGEN Hello? \n", "test1_id": 2298, "test2_input": "SANDRA (O.S.) She's gone, Tom. \nSandra has followed him into Michael's house. \nHAGEN What do you mean gone? \nSANDRA The Barretts from Rubicon Bay came by in a new speedboat.  Rocco tried to say she wasn't in, but Kay spotted them and asked if they would take her and the kids for a ride.  That was three hours ago. \nHAGEN (furious) Why didn't someone tell me! \nSANDRA I wanted to tell you alone; your wife doesn't know what's going on. \nHagen rushes out of the house. \nEXT. TAHOE LAWN - DAY \nHagen moves quickly out of Michael's house; moving across the lawn to the boathouse. \nHAGEN'S SON Hey, Dad! \nThis time he ignores the thrown ball, and moves directly to Rocco, who is by some men near the boathouse. \nHAGEN Rocco! \nROCCO I know.  I went down to the Barrett house.  But she's gone.  They drove her and the kids to North Tahoe airport. \nHAGEN Goddamn it, where were you? \nROCCO I was in my house.  Willy tried, but it would have taken some strong-arm to stop her, and he figured you wouldn't want that. \nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - DAY \nThey enter the boathouse. \nHAGEN (to one of the men) Get me a Scotch and water. \nThe man hurries behind the bar. \nROCCO She took a flight to San Francisco. We figure she's going to connect to New Hampshire; her parents' place. \nHAGEN (almost to himself) I can't let him down. \nHe swallows the drink down in several gulps.  And then looks up to his men watching him.  He's embarrassed to have shown such weakness. \nHAGEN All right, let me think a minute. \nRocco clears the men out. \nROCCO Me too, Tom? \nHAGEN Yeah, give me a minute. \nRocco gone, Hagen moves behind the enormous bar, and pours himself a giant drink.  He drinks that, and calms himself. \nHAGEN Oh Christ, Pop.  It was so good when you were alive.  I felt I could handle anything... \nEXT. VIEW FROM BOAT - FULL VIEW - DAY \nA beautiful coastal view of a tropical Caribbean city.  An extraordinary view, high buildings, palm trees, all set right on the bay. \nMED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL \non the cruiser, Bussetta a little distance away, watching, but never speaking.  The dark-skinned CAPTAIN of the cruiser keeps pointing repeatedly. \nCAPTAIN Habana, Habana. \nEXT. HAVANA STREET - MOVING VIEW - DAY \nMichael and Bussetta are driven in a Mercury sedan, making its way through the streets of Havana. \nCLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL \nlooking out the window. \nMICHAEL'S POV \nCrowded streets, occasional roving bands playing for the tourists; there is much evidence of tourism: Americans walking through the streets with cameras.  Occasionally, we see a Cuban with a row of numbers attached to his hat, carrying a big sheet of the daily lottery numbers.  From all of these street impressions, the city is booming with activity, but there is also much evidence of whores and pimps and little children begging in the streets. \nMED. VIEW \nThe big American car stops at an intersection.  Bussetta is sitting in the forward passenger side; while Michael is in the back.  He hears tapping on the window; he turns and sees four Cuban boys tapping on his window and extending their hands, and rubbing their stomachs as though they were hungry. The Cuban driver rolls down his window and shouts them away in Spanish. \nINT. HAVANA CASINO LOBBY - MOVING VIEW - NIGHT \nMichael is led through a beautiful wooden lobby of the hotel, done in Spanish style, apparently just recently completed.  He is approached by a thin, mousy man, SAM ROTH, who ushers him toward the casino entrance. \nSAM ROTH Hiya, Mr. Corleone, I'm Sam Roth. Welcome to the Capri; my brother's upstairs.  You wanta take a rest before you see him, or can I get you something, anything at all? \nMICHAEL No, I'm fine. \nHe leads Michael into the main casino. \nSAM ROTH This is it!  We think it makes Vegas look like the corner crap game. \nMICHAEL Very impressive. \nSAM ROTH Jake, Jake, come over here.  Mike, I want you to meet Jake Cohen; he manages the casino for us. \nCOHEN (appreciating Michael's status) Mr. Corleone. \nSam turns to Bussetta and extends his glad-hand. \nSAM ROTH Pleasure to meet you, I'm sure... \nHe gets no response whatsoever from Bussetta. \nINT. PRESIDENTIAL PALACE - NIGHT \nAn extremely tall, well-built Cuban, tanned and wearing an attractive mustache, LEON, in his middle forties, reads from a prepared paper.  His sentences are translated by a smaller man, standing to his rear. \nLEON (Spanish) Most respected gentlemen, allow me to welcome you to the City of Havana, the Republic of Cuba on behalf of His Excellency, Fulgencio Batista. \nTHE VIEW BEGINS TO MOVE along the various men gathered for this meeting. \nLEON (O.S.) I'd like to thank this distinguished group of American Industrialists, for continuing to work with Cuba, for the greatest period of prosperity in her entire history. Mr. William Proxmiro, representing the General Fruit Company... Messrs. Corngold and Dant, of the United Telephone and Telegraph Company; Mr. Petty, regional Vice-President of the Pan American Mining Corporation; and, of course, our friend Mr. Robert Allen, of South American Sugar.  Mr. Nash of the American State Department.  And Mr. Hyman Roth of Miami, and Michael Corleone of Nevada representing our Associates in Tourism and Leisure Activities. \nVIEW ON THE ENTIRE GROUP \nLeon pauses to take a drink of water.  Then proudly, he lifts a shiny yellow telephone for all to see. \nLEON The President would like to take this opportunity to thank U T&T for their lovely gift: a solid gold telephone!  He thought all you gentlemen would care to take a look at it. \nHe hands the heavy phone set to one of his aides, and it is passed in turn to each of the men in attendance. \nCORNGOLD Your Excellency, perhaps you could discuss the status of rebel activity and how this may affect our businesses. \nMED. CLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL \nHe receives the telephone, and glances at it before passing it on to Hyman Roth. \nLEON (O.S.) Of course.  The rebel movement is basically unpopular, and since July of 1958 has been contained in the Oriente Province, in the mountains of the Sierra Muestre. \nMichael passes the phone on to Roth. \n", "test2_true": "General subdued laughter. \nA CUBAN STREET - LATE DAY \nPolice are stopping traffic.  Michael's Mercury is among the cars; a police officer, seeing that some important person is being driven, walks up to the driver.  He leans forward, and says something in Spanish to the driver. \nThe driver, in turn, leans over to Michael. \nDRIVER He says it will just be a short time and they'll let us through. \nMichael looks out the window. \nMICHAEL'S VIEW \nThe old building has been totally surrounded by police and military vehicles.  Right at this moment, they are waiting lazily, but soldiers are there with automatic weapons ready. There is a momentary commotion inside the building, and the men brace up.  A Captain of the Army detachment says something in Spanish over a megaphone; and his men put their weapons at the ready, as other policemen lead a group of civilians out of the building with their hands up. \nThey are moved over to some military truck, where they are frisked before being loaded. \nAll of a sudden, one of the civilian rebels breaks loose, and rushes toward the command vehicle.  He hurls himself into the vehicle, as two police try to pull him out.  A second later, and there is an explosion; the man obviously having hidden a grenade on his body, sacrificing his own life to take the life of the Captain. \nThere is a commotion, but the military quickly quell it. \nCLOSE VIEW ON MICHAEL \nwatching.  The police rush to Michael's car and guide it outside of the trouble area. \nMED. VIEW \nas they lead and escort the Mercury out of the area. \nEXT. HAVANA COUNTRY CLUB - CLOSE VIEW - DAY \nSome glasses; rum is poured into them; then Coca Cola. Quarter limes are squeezed. \nSAM ROTH (O.S.) Rum... Coca Cola...a squeeze of fresh lime... \nSam prepares the drinks for his brother, Hyman, and a group of men, including Michael. \nMAN Cuba Libres. \nMICHAEL I was told the Cubans now call this drink: \"La Mentira.\" \nROTH I still don't speak Spanish, Michael. \nMICHAEL It means... \"The Lie.\" \nA moment's hesitation, then a few of the men laugh.  Now two Cubans in white carry a table which has a lovely small cake on it. \nSAM ROTH The cake is here. \nThey all raise their glasses to the old man. \nEVERYONE (ad lib) Happy Birthday! \nRoth glances at the cake and its inscription, is pleased. \nROTH I hope my age is correct: I am always accurate about my age. \nSome laugh.  He nods, and they begin to cut it, put a piece on plates, and carry them to the different men. \nROTH Everything we've learned in Vegas is true here; but we can go further. The bigger, the swankier, the plusher the store, the more a sense of legitimacy, and the bigger business we do. (looking at the plate brought to him) A smaller piece.  What we've proposed to the Cuban Government is that it put up half the cash on a dollar for dollar basis. (accepting a smaller piece) Thank you.  We can find people in the United States who will put up our share for a small piece of the action, yet we will retain control. \nONE OF THE MEN How much? \nROTH A hundred million dollars.  But only if this Government relaxes its restrictions on importing building materials; we'll need some new laws, too, but that will be no difficulty. \nANOTHER MAN What are import duties now? \nROTH As much as seventy percent.  Also, I'm working out an arrangement with the Minister of Labor so that all our pit bosses, stick-men and Dealers, can be considered specialized technicians eligible for two year visas.  As of now they're only allowed in Cuba for six months at a time.  In short, we're in a full partnership with the Cuban Government. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL \nis handed a piece of cake.  Roth moves over to a folder of documents. \nROTH (continuing) Here are applications from Friends all over the States.  I understand Santo Virgilio in Tampa is trying to make his own deal.  Well, the Cuban Government will brush him off. The Lakeville Road Boys are going to take over the Nacionale here. I'm planning a new hotel casino to be known as Riviera.  The new Capri will go to the Corleone Family. \nMED. VIEW \nThe cake is sliced and carried to each of the men. \nROTH Then there's the Sevilla Biltmore; the Havana Hilton, which is going to cost twenty-four million -- Cuban banks will put up half, the Teamsters will bankroll the rest. Generally, there will be friends for all our friends including the Lieutenant Governor of Nevada; Eddie Levine of Newport will bring in the Pennino Brothers, Dino and Eddie; they'll handle actual casino operations. \nAnd seeing that all of his friends have been served, Roth raises his fork. \nROTH Enjoy. \nMICHAEL I saw an interesting thing today. A man was being arrested by the Military Police; probably an urban guerrilla.  Rather than be taken alive, he exploded a grenade hidden in his jacket, taking the command vehicle with him. \nThe various men look up as Michael eats his cake, wondering what the point of it is. \nMICHAEL It occurred to me: the police are paid to fight, and the Rebels are not. \nSAM ROTH So? \nMICHAEL So, that occurred to me. \nVIEW ON ROTH \nHe understands Michael's point, if the others do not. \nROTH This country has had rebels for the last fifty years; it's part of their blood.  Believe me, I know... I've been coming here since the twenties; we were running molasses out of Havana when you were a baby. To trucks owned by your father. (he chuckles warmly over the memory) We'll talk when we're alone. \nAnd he returns his attention to the men who are gathered with him on his birthday. \nEXT. ROTH'S PRIVATE TERRACE - DAY \nMichael sits alone with the old man, on a terrace that overlooks the city. \nROTH You have to be careful what you say in front of the others... they frighten easy.  It's always been that way, most men frighten easy. \nMICHAEL We're making a big investment in Cuba.  That's my only concern. \nROTH My concern is that the three million never arrived at Batista's numbered account in Switzerland. He thinks it's because you have second thoughts about his ability to stop the rebels. \nMICHAEL The money was sent. \nROTH Then you have to trace it.  Michael, people here look at me as a reliable man.  I can't afford not to be looked on as a reliable man.  But you know all that; there's nothing you can learn from me.  You shouldn't have to put up with a sick old man as a partner. \nMICHAEL I wouldn't consider anyone else. \nROTH Except the President of the United States. \nHe laughs slyly, as though this is some private joke between them.  Then his laughter becomes a cough, which he painfully stifles with a handkerchief. \nROTH If only I could live to see it, kid; to be there with you.  How beautifully we've done it, step by step.  Here, protected, free to make our profits without the Justice Department, the FBI; ninety miles away in partnership with a friendly government.  Ninety miles, just a small step, looking for a man who desperately wants to be President of the United States, and having the cash to make it possible. \nMICHAEL You'll be there to see it; you'll be there. \nINT. MICHAEL'S SUITE - NIGHT \nThe telephone has just rung; Michael listens. \n", "test2_id": 2299, "test3_input": "INT. MICHAEL'S HOUSE - DAY \nFriends, relatives; Francesca and her new husband, Gardner and their baby; Sandra Corleone; Teresa, her children; all the familiar faces of the family are present, quietly paying their respects to Mama. \nSome of the men can be seen in the kitchen, drinking wine, and talking in low voices. \nFredo is there, broken-hearted over the loss of his Mother; like some lost child with no friends. \nMED. VIEW \nMichael enters the room, followed by Connie, who tends little Mary and Anthony. \nHe approaches his brother, and then embraces.  Fredo breaks into tears. \nFREDO Christ, Mike.  Jesus Christ, Mike. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL \nembracing his brother, he glances up. \nVIEW ON NERI \nquiet, and deadly. \nEXT. THE TAHOE ESTATE - MED. VIEW - DAY \nTom Hagen is talking in the distance to his wife, and one of his older sons; he kisses, and moves toward the boathouse. After crossing the lawn, he stops. \nVIEW ON SANDRA CORLEONE \nwaiting there; obviously wanting to talk to him.  He continues, and she walks with him. \nMOVING VIEW ON THE TWO \nas they cross toward the boathouse. \nSANDRA You're going to talk to him now. \nHAGEN Yes. \nSANDRA Will you tell him? \nHAGEN I don't know. \nShe stops him. \nSANDRA Tom, think of yourself for once. Don't let this opportunity slip through your fingers; don't do it. We're all trapped here, don't you see? \nHe continues past her, without answering her.  Continues up to the boathouse.  He stops before he enters. \nHAGEN'S VIEW \nFredo is sitting by the edge of the harbor with Michael's son Anthony; he is helping him with some fishing rig. \nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - VIEW ON MICHAEL - DAY \nlooking through the window at his son and brother.  Neri sits in the room, dressed informally. \nMICHAEL (without looking back) Sit down, Tom.  Have you heard about our friend and partner, Mr. Hyman Roth? \nHAGEN I know he's in Israel. \nNERI (hands Hagen the paper) The High Court of Israel turned down his request to live as a 'returned Jew.' His passport's been invalidated except for return to the U.S.  He landed in Buenos Aires yesterday, offered a gift of one million dollars if they would give him citizenship.  They turned him down. \nHAGEN (reading) He's going to try Panama... \nMICHAEL They won't take him; not for a million, not for ten million. \nHAGEN His medical condition is reported as... \"terminal.\" \nMICHAEL He's been dying of the same heart attack for twenty years. \nHAGEN That plane goes to Miami... \nMICHAEL I want it met. \nHAGEN (understanding) Mike, it's impossible.  He'll be met by the Internal Revenue; the Customs Service, and half the FBI. \nMICHAEL I don't like it when you use the word impossible; nothing is impossible... \nHAGEN Mike, it would be like trying to kill the President; there's no way we can get to him. \nMICHAEL I'm surprised at you, Tom.  If there's anything certain; certain in life; if history has taught us anything, it's that you can kill... (he stops, then coldly) ANYBODY.  But perhaps your relucatance is because you've come to tell me that you're moving your family to Vegas, that you've been offered the Vice-Presidency of the Houstan Hotels there.  Or weren't you going to tell me at all? \nHAGEN Are you so hungry for traitors; do you want to find them everywhere? \nMICHAEL They are everywhere! \nHAGEN I turned Houstan down; I didn't see why I should tell you about an offer I turned down. (Michael begins to confuse him) Are you sure, Mikey?  Are you sure of what we're doing; what we'll gain; what does the family gain? Forget that, Mike; I already know the answer. \nMICHAEL I know you do, Tom.  Then I can count on you to help me do the things I have to do.  If not, call Houstan, and become a Vice-President. Take your family and your mistress and move them to Las Vegas. \nHAGEN Why do you hurt me, Michael?  I've always been loyal to you. \nMICHAEL Good.  Then you're staying. \nHAGEN I'm staying. (he pauses...then, without being asked) Don't ever enjoy the cruel part of all this; Sonny never listened to me about that. (then he sits down, and opens his briefcase) Now, explain everything to me. \nEXT. THE HARBOR - DAY \nFredo sits with Anthony, with a silly-looking fishing hat on his head, covered with lure and flies. \nFREDO Anthony, ole buddy, your Uncle Fredo's gonna teach you how to catch the big fish.  You know, when I was a kid, I did this amazing thing.  I went out on a fishing trip; me and my brothers and my Pop, and no one could catch a fish except me.  And this was my secret: (confidentially) Every time I would put the line down I would say a \"Hail Mary\" and every time I said a \"Hail Mary\" I would catch a fish.  Now, when it's sunset, we're gonna go out on the lake, and we're gonna try it. \nINT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY \nThe guards step aside as Tom Hagen enters the foyer of the house.  He shows a court order to them and they lead him up the stairs where he knocks on the door. \nINT. GUARDED HOUSE - DAY \nThere is a KNOCK at the door.  The two guards show Hagen in and Hagen presents the court order to one of the FBI men. \nHAGEN I think I prefer to see my client privately. \nPENTANGELI The room has a bug in it. \nHAGEN (to the FBI men) I'd like to go outside with him, in the open air. \nFBI MAN #1 This room is not bugged. \nHAGEN You have guards outside and the electric fence.  There's no security reason for not letting us talk in the yard. \nFBI MAN #1 Okay. \nThey pass out of the room. \nEXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY \nHagen and Pentangeli outside, by the electric fence.  They cannot be overheard.  Pentangeli takes out some cigars and offers Hagen one.  Hagen takes it and Pentangeli lights both their cigars.  They puff on them contentedly.  They are comfortable together, almost. \nHAGEN Everything is going to be okay, Frankie, don't worry. \nPENTANGELI Did my brother go back? \n", "test3_true": "PENTANGELI He's ten times tougher than me, my brother.  He's old-fashioned. \nHAGEN Yeah.  He wouldn't even go out to dinner.  Just wanted to go home. \nPENTANGELI That's my brother.  Nothing could get him away from that two mule town.  He coulda been big over here -- he could of had his own Family. \nHAGEN You're right. \nPENTANGELI Tom, what do I do now? \nThe light is beginning to turn reddish as the sun falls. \nHAGEN Frankie, you were always interested in politics, in history.  I remember you talking about Hitler back in '43.  We were young then. \nPENTANGELI Yeah, I still read a lot.  They bring me stuff. \nHAGEN You were around the old timers who dreamed up how the Families should be organized, how they based it on the old Roman Legions, and called them 'Regimes'... with the 'Capos' and 'Soldiers,' and it worked. \nPENTANGELI Yeah, it worked.  Those were great old days.  We was like the Roman Empire.  The Corleone family was like the Roman Empire. \nHAGEN (sadly) Yeah, it was once. \nThey both puff on their cigars.  Pentangeli lets himself be carried away by thoughts of old days of glory; Hagen thinks of other days too. \nHAGEN (very gently) The Roman Empire... when a plot against the Emperor failed, the plotters were always given a chance to let their families keep their fortunes. \nPENTANGELI Yeah, but only the rich guys.  The little guys got knocked off.  If they got arrested and executed, all their estate went to the Emperor. If they just went home and killed themselves, up front, nothing happened. \nHAGEN Yeah, that was a good break.  A nice deal. \nPentangeli looks at Hagen; he understands. \nPENTANGELI They went home and sat in a hot bath and opened their veins, and bled to death.  Sometimes they gave a little party before they did it. \nHagen throws away his cigar.  Pentangeli puffs on his. \nHAGEN Don't worry about anything, Frankie Five-Angels. \nPENTANGELI Thanks, Tom.  Thanks. \nThey shake hands.  The FBI Agents come out to let Hagen out the gate.  Pentangeli is led back to the house. \nFBI MAN #1 Your lawyer tell you he can get that 600 years reduced to 500? \nPentangeli puffs on his cigar and reflects. \nPENTANGELI You boys sure you can't get me a broad for tonight?  Give me a little party? \nFBI MAN #2 We got some nice books. \nPentangeli puffs on his cigar and gives the Agent a smile an old man gives a child.  He starts upstairs. \nPENTANGELI I guess I'll just take a hot bath. \nEXT. THE ARMY POST - DAY \nHagen walks away; glances back.  Then gets into his waiting car and drives off. \nINT. THE BOATHOUSE - FULL VIEW - SUNSET \nMichael sits alone in the empty boathouse; in the shadows. \nINT. BOAT DOCK - SUNSET \nNeri stands by the dock area under the boathouse.  He pushes the button which lowers a boat by winch and tackle.  He wears a fishing cap. \nHe steps into the boat, and pulls the small outboard, which glides the boat out into the harbor. \nMED. VIEW \nThe boat pulls up alongside Fredo and Anthony. \nFREDO Here we go; and remember the secret. \nHe lifts Anthony into the boat. \nCONNIE (O.S.) Anthony. \nTHEIR VIEW \nConnie, in houseclothes, is calling Anthony. \nFREDO He's here; we're goin' fishing. \nCONNIE He can't go; Michael wants to take him into Reno. \nFREDO Ah.  Okay, kid, you got to go to Reno with your Pop. \nHe lifts the boy out of the boat, and puts him on the shore. \nFREDO I'll catch one for you, with the secret. \nCONNIE Hurry, Anthony. \nNeri stands the motor; and the boat with the two fisherman glides off. \nVIEW ON MICHAEL \nwatching, from the dark window of the boathouse. \nINT. HIGH SECURITY HOUSE IN ARMY POST - NIGHT \nThe FBI man knocks on the bathroom door in the house where they have kept Pentangeli. \nFBI MAN #1 Frankie, open up.  You okay? \nNo answer; he hammers on the door.  Using his elbow, and then a kick he breaks into the bathroom. \nHIS VIEW \nPentangeli lying in a tub of water.  His stomach shows above it.  His wrists are cut and covered with blood.  The bath water has a purplish tone. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. LAKE TAHOE - MED. VIEW - SUNSET \nFredo and Neri are fishing, each with lines out.  The VIEW MOVES CLOSER, and we can hear Fredo as he holds the pole. \nFREDO ... the Lord is with thee.  Blessed art thou amongst women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. \nLONG SHOT \nThe boat on the shimmery lake. \nFREDO ... Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us... \nWe hear a quiet, echoing GUNSHOT; and then silence. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. MIAMI AIRPORT - NIGHT \n", "test3_id": 2300}

Mother Superior stops dead in her tracks; she turns and stares at Christy.  Then she smiles, in a rather frightening manner. 
MONTAGE - CHRISTY 
A)on her hands and knees. scrubbing the stone floor of a convent hallway. 
B)crawling along between the pews in the chapel, oiling every inch of wood with a bottle of polish and a rag. 
C)crawling along the convent roof, cleaning out gutters with a trowel.  She discovers a dead rat in one of the gutters.

D)sewing; she is repairing a hole in a habit.  The CAMERA PULLS BACK.  Christy is sitting in a small stone room, surrounded by piles of torn habits, linen and other mending. 
INT. MOTHER SUPERIOR'S OFFICE 
Christy is on the phone in the darkened office.  She keeps checking the door, to make sure no one is listening. 
CHRISTY (into phone) Let me talk to Detective Eddie Mulcahy. It's an emergency.  Real bad. 
EDDIE'S VOICE Mulcahy. 
Christy cups her hand around the phone and speaks quietly and frantically.  INTERCUT between Christy and Eddie. 
CHRISTY Eddie, you've got to get me out of here. 
EDDIE Not again.  You can't keep calling. Somebody's going to catch on to where you are. 
CHRISTY But I'm going insane!  All these people do is pray and work, work and pray!  I don't get it -- when's the weekend? They have gruel, Eddie, that's what they call food!  Gruel -- it's like Alpo for nuns! I sleep in a cell, on a board, and I pray five times a days  Do you know what I pray for, Eddie, do you have any idea? Check your crotch, Eddie --anything fall off yet?  Get me outta her! 
EDDIE Calm down.  Look, I didn't want to tell you this, but we've had some problems with our protection program lately. 
CHRISTY Like what? 
EDDIE Keeping our witnesses alive.  We hide them, but there's a leak in the department, and they end up dead. 
CHRISTY You son-of-a-bitch!

EDDIE I just need a few more weeks, 
CHRISTY But it's a nightmare!  Mother Superior is out to get me!  She hates my guts! She keeps thinking up new kinds of torture! 
In the distance, Christy hears the CHOIR practicing; they sound even worse than usual. 
CHRISTY (holding the phone out) Do you hear that?  That choir?  Eddie, in here, that's what they call music! 
EDDIE Don't call again.  It's not safe.  I'll be in touch. 
As the line goes dead, Mother Superior enters.  Christy takes her dust rag and pretends to polish the receiver. She sings as she works. 
CHRISTY THE HILLS ARE ALIVE WITH THE SOUND OF MUSIC... 
Still singing, Christy breezes out of the room.  Mother Superior looks mystified. 
INT. CHRISTY'S CELL - MIDNIGHT 
Christy is lying flat out on her bed, in her habit, utterly exhausted by the week's hard labor.  There is a meek SCRATCHING at her door. 
CHRISTY (without moving) Yeah? 
Sister Mary Robert enters, very shyly.  She barely looks up. 
CHRISTY What?  What does she want now?  I did the dishes.  I oiled the pews.  I dusted the hymnals.  Two hundred hymnals.  Why can't people share? 
MARY ROBERT (not speaking above a whisper) I... I... 
Page 48. 
CHRISTY What? 
MARY ROBERT I... I brought you something. 
CHRISTY A cigarette? 
MARY ROBERT An extra heel of bread.  Please take it, you need your strength.  You've been working so hard. 
Mary Robert holds out a rather rugged crust of brown bread.  Christy takes it.. 
CHRISTY Thanks.  So which one are you? Sister Bruce?  Sister Doug? 
MARY ROBERT (until almost whispering) Mary Robert.  I'm... Mary Robert. 
CHRISTY Right.  Okay.  Bob.  Nice to know you. 
Mary Robert nods, and resumes looking at her hands.  She doesn't 1eave, but she's still tongue-tied. Christy is at a loss. 
CHRISTY So, Bob, how long have you been in? St. K's? 
MARY ROBERT Three years.  Sister. 
CHRISTY Three years.  A rookie. 
MARY ROBERT A novice.

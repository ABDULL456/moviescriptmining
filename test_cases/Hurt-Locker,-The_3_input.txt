AMBASSADOR GEDDES ...So in sixteen months time I believe five million gallons per day is in fact rather conservative. 
SOUNDS out the window. An Executive turns his head nervously. 
EXECUTIVE But security is still the big variable? 
The Ambassador brushes his hand in dismissal. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Only on the margins. (SMILING) Everyday, the risks diminish and the rewards multiply-- 
Eldridge enters. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Ah, and here is EOD. You see gentlemen, everything is fine. The site is secure. The bomb -- if there even is one -- will easily be dispensed by the crack American team. 
ELDRIDGE Excuse me. 
Eldridge rushes over to the window to see the street. 
ELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) Blaster Mike, I'm at the window. 
SANBORN 
He's stationed himself near the mouth of the alley.   Wisps of smoke and flames in the air. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Copy that. How's the fire look from up there. 
AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE 
ELDRIDGE (INTO WALKIE) Flames a meter high, over. 
JAMES 
Close to the burning car. SMOKE rising from the hood and the under carriage awash in FLAMES, like a sleeping dragon. 
James sprays the fire-extinguisher and the fire subsides. He inspects the interior - looks normal enough - and tries to open the trunk with a pair of pliers, but the handle doesn't give and snaps off under his effort. He kicks the trunk but it remains shut. He turns and lumbers up range, jaw set. 
SANBORN 
Watching James walk back uprange. 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Blaster One, what is going on? 
JAMES O.S. (HEADSET) Stay put, I'll be right back. 
Standing alone in the kill zone at the mouth of the alley. 
ELDRIDGE (OVER WALKIE) What's happening? 
SANBORN (INTO WALKIE) Good question. But I'm not liking it. 
HUMVEE 
James is buried inside the Humvee, searching. He tosses what he doesn't need, and a succession of items comes flying out -- food, clothing, a tarp. Now James walks back towards the Blue Opal without saying a word. In his hand is a crowbar. 
BLUE OPAL 
James winds up and swings hard at the door. Wham! Nope. Wham! Wham! Wham! 
He drops the crowbar and tries the trunk. Presto, it opens, revealing: a trunk overflowing with EXPLOSIVES -- ten times what we've seen before. James is taken aback. 
JAMES (HEADSET) We're all in the kill zone on this one. 
SANBORN 
Sanborn stares at James and the car. Great. 
JAMES 
Now inside the car, slipping on the slimy seats, he cuts the seat cushions with his knife, and rips out the foam upholstery, and finds more bad news buried underneath: SIX ARTILLERY SHELLS and a WIRE that leads to the floorboard and goes under the carpeting. 
James DIVES to the wire and cuts it, then rips open the carpet to reveal more wire -- and follows the wire through the car, ripping apart the car PIECE by PIECE, cutting wire as he goes. 
AMBASSADOR'S OFFICE 
An executive gets up to look out the window. 
ELDRIDGE (TO EXECUTIVE) Sir, I'm going to need you to stay away from the window. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Yes, please, sit down. It's safe. 
EXECUTIVE Why is he here, if it's safe? 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES He is just an observer. 
EXECUTIVE (TO ELDRIDGE) Is that true, we're safe here? 
ELDRIDGE (DISTRACTED) In my opinion, no. 
Executives take this as a cue to leave. Getting up, shuffling out of the room. The Ambassador is furious at Eldridge, advancing on him. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES This is idiotic. Why not tow the vehicle away from the building? 
ELDRIDGE I believe the lane is too narrow for a Humvee, Sir. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Donkeys.   Use donkeys. 
ELDRIDGE I don't believe we have any of those on hand, Sir. 
AMBASSADOR GEDDES Jesus, Lord. You Americans really are incompetent. No donkeys on hand? What do you think I'm talking about, a full squadron of farm animals?

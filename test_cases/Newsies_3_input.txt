SARAH Denton's story. JACK Denton looked out for hisself just like I gotta do -- so save it. SARAH Just listen! 'The men who run this city are terrified of the Newsies strike -- because other child laborers in the factories and sweatshops are hearing the message of the Newsies leader --' LES That's you!   He's writin' about you! 
SARAH 'In the voice of Jack Kelly, these children hear strength and pride. Most of all, they hear hope...' 
Jack listens questioningly. JACK Keep reading. Can these words really be about him...?     As we GO TO -- 
160D   EXT. ALLEY - LATE AFTERNOON                                  160D Denton reads his own words:

JACK The minute I show my face, I'm back in the Refuge. DENTON You'd have help this time. I've been investigating the Refuge -- I know somebody who's going to be very interested in Snyder's little racket. 
DAVID (wryly) What happened to the ace war correspondent? DENTON This war'll do for now. 
SARAH Whatever happens, it's Jack's decision. He's the one in danger. They look expectantly as he stares off, deep in thought. LES Jack...?   You thinkin'...? JACK Yeah... I'm thinkin' of Newsie Square full of kids... 
DAVID (picks it up) ... Another rally, right under Pulitzer's nose, and not just the Newsies -- JACK -- Every workin' kid from every sweatshop in New York. We gotta get the word out -- let's go get the Newsies -- (catches himself) They still think I'm a scab...

JACK Whattaya need to start a paper? Writers, right? So we got Denton. What else? 
LES Advertisements! (as they look at him) Cartoons? DENTON (the cold facts) A printing press. And no paper or printer is going to defy Pulitzer. The others look discouraged; Jack's thinking again. 
JACK Les. Go set me straight with the Newsies, okay? Tell 'em to meet us later at the World Building. 
Les races off on his mission; the others look question- ingly at Jack.

{"train": "He sits back in his corner and carefully unwraps it. It's an OLD LEATHER-BOUND BOOK. The binding cracked and pages dog- eared, thumbed through a thousand times and more. \nEli gazes lovingly at it. Lets his fingers play across the beat-up old leather cover. A cherished thing. \nHe begins to read, half-hidden in the shadows of the fading sunlight. Silently mouthing the words as he reads them. \nMANY PAGES LATER \nEli closes the book and parcels it back up as before. Replaces it in his pack, then reaches in for something else. \nA CAR BATTERY. Old and streaked with acid stains. Attached to a tangled bunch of ELECTRICAL WIRING and JUMPER CABLES. Eli reaches into his pocket and produces: \nAN IPOD. Badly beat-up, the case pretty much held together with duct tape. But functional. Eli attaches the battery cable to the iPod and places the headphones in his ears. \nThe music plays. Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 20 in D Minor. Eli rests back against the wall and pushes the volume way up. \nTHE MUSIC SWELLS. Eli's fingers dance and swoop in the air, as though conducting an orchestra, as he is transported by the music to another world, a world far from this one. \nMORNING \nSunlight shafts through the window. Eli sits slumped in the exact same position, headphones still in his ears. Asleep. \nThe rat scurries up Eli's chest and licks his face. Slowly, he wakes, realizing he fell asleep with his music still on. Checks the battery. It's dead, drained overnight. He frowns. \nHe gets to his feet, moves to the window and checks outside. All seems quiet. He loads up his backpack and weapons. \nELI Come on now. \nThe rat scurries up his leg, onto his duster and disappears into the breast pocket. Eli turns and moves out. \nEXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - MORNING \nThe gate squeaks shut behind Eli as he exits the front yard. \nHe breathes in the air, turns to feel the warm morning sun on his face. Then turns away from it and walks on down the road. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nThe landscape barren and featureless, road lined with dead trees. Eli walks along the warped and broken asphalt. \nThe road is strewn with burned-out cars and debris from a world long dead. A warped metal sign by the side of the road reads: LITTER REMOVAL NEXT TWO MILES BY: \"CIRCUIT CITY\". \nUp ahead is a HUNCHED FIGURE by the side of the road. Eli arrives to see that it's a YOUNG WOMAN. Bone-thin, dressed in filthy rags. Skin plagued by an unpleasant rash. \nThe SHOPPING CART she was pushing has overturned into a roadside ditch, spilling its contents. Blankets, tins of food, old clothes. She's on her knees trying to gather it up. \nShe looks up as she sees Eli approaching. Instantly cowers from him, raising her hands to protect herself. Terrified. \nYOUNG WOMAN Oh. Please don't hurt me. Here, take anything you want. You want some food? Take it. \nShe offers him a can of pet food with a trembling hand. Eli stands there looking at her. His expression impossible to read behind the mirrored goggles. \nELI I'm not going to hurt you. \nYOUNG WOMAN That's what the last guys said. \nEli bends down and picks up a couple of the cart's spilled contents. Steps forward and offers them to her. \nELI Here. \nShe blinks. Unsure. Cautiously she reaches out and takes it. \nYOUNG WOMAN Could you help me? The wheel came off. I can't fix it. Maybe if I could get it out of the ditch. But I can't. \nEli looks at the cart. It has come to rest in the ditch just inches from a THICK BRACKEN HEDGEROW that lines the road. \nHe looks again at the girl. Her faded blouse is unbuttoned, revealing a little cleavage. Her skirt torn along the leg, showing more than a little thigh. Almost deliberate. \nHe sniffs the air. Watches the hedgerow warily. Just like the cat he hunted, his senses heightened and on alert. \nBehind the hedge, THREE ROADSIDE BANDITS are crouched, waiting to pounce. Each armed with a crude blunt weapon. They exchange anxious looks. \nELI sniffs the air again - then backs away from the girl. \nELI One good thing about no soap any more. You can smell the road agents a mile off. \nThe girl's face falls as Eli backs up. The three bandits EMERGE FROM THE HEDGEROW, brandishing their weapons. A couple of them wear old sunglasses and goggles similar to Eli's. \nThe BANDIT LEADER grabs the girl by a fistful of hair as he passes, yanking her painfully to her feet. \nBANDIT LEADER Dumb bitch. What did we tell you? \nHe pushes her away, she crumples to the road in a heap. \nEli backs away, but TWO MORE ARMED BANDITS drop from hiding in the trees behind, cutting off his escape, surrounding him. \nBANDIT LEADER What you got there in the pack? \nLATER \nThe five bodies are lined neatly in the ditch, half-covered with dirt. The best burial they are going to get. \nEli stands before them, head bowed in prayer. He speaks quietly and quickly, a speech he has given many times. \nELI God, the father of mercies, through the death and resurrection of his son has reconciled the world to himself and sent the holy spirit among us for the forgiveness of sins. \nThe young woman stands a few yards away, watching him, transfixed. She has never seen anyone like him. \nELI Through the ministry of the church may he give you pardon and peace, and I absolve you from your sins in the name of the father, and of the son, and of the holy spirit. Amen. \nHe turns and walks away down the road, passing the woman. \nYOUNG WOMAN Thank you. You're... a good man. \nELI There are no good men on the road. \nYOUNG WOMAN Where are you going? \nELI West. \nYOUNG WOMAN Can... can I come with you? \nHe doesn't even turn back to look at her. \nELI No. \nHe walks on, into the horizon. \nEXT. FREEWAY OVERPASS - DAY \nStraddling the desert like a giant, crumbling monument to a long-dead civilization. Eli steadily climbs his way up. \nHe comes to an abrupt stop as we realize suddenly that the overpass has COLLAPSED at mid-point. RUSTED IRON RODS jut out from where the roadway has been severed. \nEli just stands there at the edge for a moment, feeling the wind whip around him, his coat fluttering in the breeze. \nThe overpass's collapsed section is now just a MOUNTAINOUS PILE OF RUBBLE that leads down to the road below. \nEli steps onto the rubble. About to make his way down when he FREEZES. He hears something. The faintest of sounds. He takes cover, peering down at the road beneath the overpass to see: \nTWO PEOPLE walking together on the road. We see everything from ELI'S P.O.V. - too far to make out much detail, but apparently it is a MIDDLE-AGED COUPLE. \nThe man pushes along an OLD WHEELBARROW covered by a tarp as the woman, seemingly his wife, walks alongside. The barrow's rusted wheel gives out a plaintive, rhythmic SQUEAK. \nEli ducks down again as he hears something else. This time much louder. The menacing growl of MOTORCYCLE ENGINES. \nFOUR BIKES IN TOTAL. Riding out of the horizon, closing in on the couple. They see the bikes coming and panic. Try desperately to steer the barrow off the road. \nThe bikes screech to a halt and the FOUR RIDERS dismount. Brandishing a variety of weapons. The couple make a run for it but they're quickly chased down and tackled to the ground. \nThe woman SCREAMS and struggles helplessly as the bikers swarm over the man like a pack of predatory animals. \nThe woman is pulled to the ground and the clothes stripped from her. Eli turns away. He knows what comes next. \nEli listens as the woman screams and screams. He reaches for his shotgun... hesitates... then withdraws his hand. \nELI It ain't your concern. Stay on the path. It ain't your concern. Stay on the path. \nEli repeats it like a mantra. He clearly wants to intervene, but will not permit himself to. Instead, he simply sits and waits grimly as the woman continues to scream for help. And then finally, suddenly, is silenced. \nDown below, the bodies of the man and woman lay dead and bloodied in the dirt. The bikers tear the tarp from the wheelbarrow, spilling its contents onto the asphalt. \nThey ferret through the items, scavenging a few items - we don't see what - and stuffing them into an old cloth satchel. They leave the rest strewn in the road and ride off in the direction they came, dust pluming in their wake. \nEli waits until the sound of the motorcycles has receded into the far distance before emerging from his hiding place. \nEXT. ROAD BENEATH OVERPASS - DAY \nEli crouches on one knee before the murdered couple. He signs a cross over their ravaged bodies as he mutters a prayer under his breath. Then stands and continues on down the road. \nEXT. ROAD FORK - DAY \nMore desolate wasteland as far as the eye can see. The road forks again here. Eli arrives at the junction and stops. \nThe road Eli is on leads further into the west. The other fork heads toward a SMALL TOWN just visible on the horizon. \nA HAND-PAINTED SIGN has been driven into the dirt nearby. No words, just a series of CRUDE PICTOGRAMS. A BED. A PLATE OF FOOD. A WATER FAUCET. AN ARROW points toward the town. \nEli pauses, thinking it over. Retrieves the iPod from his pocket. Clicks the button, but no response. He sighs. \nHe turns and heads down the other fork, toward town. \nEXT. DESERT TOWN - OUTSKIRTS - DAY \nA primitive, sprawling village of tents and barn-like structures. Built from corrugated iron, rotted wood, molded plastic, tarpaulin - materials scavenged from the old world. \nEli raises his hand and holds it outstretched, palm faced downward. The engineer watches it closely for any sign of ticks or tremors, but Eli's hand stays steady as a rock. \nELI I'm not one of them. \nThe sight of the steady hand seems to reassure the engineer a little. Finally, he lowers the shotgun. \nENGINEER What do you want? \nELI I'm just passing through. I need some help. I can pay. \nENGINEER What kinda help? And what kinda pay? \nELI I'm going to get something out of my pack. Okay? \nThe engineer raises the shotgun nervously again. \nELI I know, I know. Slowly. \nThe engineer watches him like a hawk as Eli opens up his pack and pulls out the car battery. When he sees it, he gasps. \nENGINEER Holy shit. \nEli places it on the counter. The engineer looks it over with awe, like it's a priceless historical artifact. \nENGINEER Where'd you find this? \nELI Years ago, in the outland back east aways. \nENGINEER Does it work? \nELI Yeah, it just needs a charge. Can you do it? I got the cables. \nENGINEER Depends if you also got the coin. \nEli pulls the Zippo lighter from his pocket. The engineer picks it up, sparks the flint, watches the flame flicker. \nENGINEER It'll take a couple hours. There's a bar across the street you can wait, they just opened up. \nELI I'll wait here. \nENGINEER You don't trust me? \nELI (SMILES) I don't know you. \nINT. PALLADIUM - AUDITORIUM - DAY \nThis once grand theater have been largely gutted - seats torn out, fixtures and fittings stripped, curtains ripped from the stage. But still, there's a sense of grandeur to this place. \nLooking out over the stage, a ROYAL BOX - once the most prestigious seat in the house - has been converted into an OFFICE of sorts. Seats removed and replaced by an ORNATE MAHOGANY DESK facing inward, a CHANDELIER suspended above it. \nThe whole set-up is gaudy and ostentatious - the work of someone who wants to project an aura of power and wealth, but has no taste whatsoever. \nA TALL MAN is seated in a battered leather armchair behind the desk, deeply involved in an OLD PAPERBACK BOOK. \nThe book's cover is faded and partially torn away, the title still just visible: 7 HABITS OF HIGHLY EFFECTIVE PEOPLE. \nThe man is OLDER than most we've seen. His skin weathered by the elements and by a long life's experience. One of the very few people we've seen in this world close to Eli's age - and unlike everyone else we've seen, he appears healthy and well- groomed. A rich mane of hair, full set of teeth. \nHe wears a tattered SUIT AND TIE. None of it matches, everything scavenged from different outfits and eras. But he looks almost civilized. Respectable. His name is CARNEGIE. \nHe looks up from his book at the sound of a POLITE COUGH O.S. \nREDRIDGE stands before him. Tall, powerfully built. \nCARNEGIE What is it? \nHis accent is like caramel. A RICH, DEEP-SOUTH DRAWL. \nREDRIDGE Survey team just finished up their inspection. It ain't good. \nCarnegie lowers his book. Concerned. \nCARNEGIE How bad is it? \nREDRIDGE Pressure is down again, and going by the new rod they sank levels're lower than they've ever been. \nCarnegie stands. Thinking. This is bad news. \nCARNEGIE How long? \nREDRIDGE Hard to say. Six months, maybe. A little longer if we're careful. But we're already- \nCARNEGIE Halve the rations. \nREDRIDGE We just halved `em last- \nCARNEGIE So halve them again! \nThe bikers exchange looks. They understood maybe half the words in that sentence. The lead biker - named HOG - speaks. \nHOG We did good. \nCARNEGIE Well, let's see, shall we? \nHog tips the satchel's contents out onto Carnegie's desk. \nBOOKS. About a dozen different volumes of all shapes and sizes. Carnegie rifles excitedly through the collection. \nWe see various titles as he sorts through them. Treasure Island. The Da Vinci Code. A volume of encyclopedia. The Diary of Anne Frank. Tuesdays with Morrie. \nIn amongst the books are a few MAGAZINES. An old issue of OPRAH magazine. A torn copy of SPORTS ILLUSTRATED... \n...And a NEWSWEEK. The cover graphic illustrates OPPOSING NUCLEAR ARSENALS over a world globe. On one side the STARS AND STRIPES, on the other flags indicating a SINO-ISLAMIC ALLIANCE. The headline reads: \"IS THERE NO TURNING BACK?\" \nCARNEGIE No. No. No. No. No. \nAs Carnegie rejects each book with growing disappointment and frustration, it's clear he's looking for a specific volume. \nCARNEGIE It's not here. \nHOG These ain't worth nothin'? \nCARNEGIE When you bring me the book I asked you for, it'll be worth something. \nThe bikers exchange more looks. An unspoken conversation. \nHOG We been doin' this a long time now. Had to make a whole lotta corpses to bring you all these books. You want us to keep at it, reckon it's worth more than a few free glasses of that swill you call liquor. \nCarnegie's guards bristle, ready for a confrontation. Carnegie just smiles, always ready to smooth things over. \nCARNEGIE Gentlemen, gentlemen. I urge you once again to take the long view here. When we find this book - and believe me, we will find it - we are going to build a new world. A world far greater, far more righteous than this one. And you and I are going to be perched right on top of it, looking down upon it, masters of all creation! \nAs always, his carefully stage-managed rhetoric is delivered with the utmost conviction, every word dripping with passion and persuasion. He's a master salesman, a true huckster. \nCARNEGIE And you know, I think you're absolutely right. (MORE) \nCARNEGIE (cont'd) That is worth more than a few glasses of liquor. A whole lot more. \nHe steps forward and looks Hog right in the eye. His gaze like a laser beam, utterly disarming. \nCARNEGIE The book I want is out there somewhere, just waiting to be found. Once there were millions of copies - you only need to find one! Find it and bring it here. And I promise you, you will be rewarded beyond anything you can imagine. \nIt's impossible not to be swayed by this guy. He's just so full of fiery passion and infectious belief, you almost want to reach into your pocket and hand over your wallet. \nHog snatches up his empty satchel. \nHOG This better not be bullshit. \nHe turns and marches to the door, the other bikers following. The guards escort them out, only Redridge remains. \nCarnegie slumps back into his chair, frustrated, pissed off. \nREDRIDGE Might help if they knew just what they were looking for. \nCARNEGIE Not one of them can read. How would they even know when they found it? \nREDRIDGE So how's about you just tell me? \nCarnegie and Redridge lock eyes. BEAT. \nREDRIDGE Two years now you been sending these crews into the outland. Burning up gas we can barely spare. For a goddamn book? What the hell kinda book can be worth all this? \nCarnegie ignores him. Stands, walks toward the door. Redridge sighs, gestures toward the books piled on Carnegie's desk. \nREDRIDGE What about these? \nCARNEGIE Put them with the others. \nINT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - DAY \nRedridge stands by the marble fireplace, tossing the books into the fire. The flames flicker and leap around the books as their pages blacken and are consumed by the fire. \nINT. ENGINEER WORKSHOP - DAY \nEli watches as the engineer charges the battery with the gas generator, which chugs noisily. \nHe licks his lips, dry as sand. Unscrews his canteen to take a drink, but it's down to its last few drips. \nELI What's this place across the street? They got any water? \nENGINEER We got our own underground spring here. Only fresh water in a hundred miles - if's you can pay for it. \nEli thinks a while longer. Then stands and stuffs his shotgun inside his pack, shoulders his gear and makes for the door. \nELI I'll be back. \nBARTENDER What about that? \nEli stuffs the pendant inside his shirt. No way that's for sale. Instead, he reaches into his coat and produces the fur pelts he skinned from the dead cat, lays them out on the bar. \nELI That's the best I got. \nThe bartender takes a pelt and examines it. The mangy cat leaps up onto the bar and approaches. Sniffs at the pelts with suspicion and HISSES at Eli. \nEli shoos the cat off the bar with a wave of his hand. At the biker's table Hog watches this, not happy about this. \nSatisfied with the pelts, the bartender gathers them up along with the scarf, then turns away toward the back room. \nBARTENDER Solara! \nA TEENAGE GIRL emerges from the back. No older than 16 or 17. Dressed in unflattering work clothes, face grimy, blonde hair tied back in a ponytail. But even through all this, it's clear she is a strikingly beautiful young woman. \nThe bartender takes Eli's canteen and hands it to Solara along with a RATION CARD he keeps around his neck. \nBARTENDER Take this out back and get it filled. \nSolara takes the canteen, pausing for a moment to look Eli up and down. Unsure quite what to make of him, but intrigued. There's something about him she can't put her finger on... \nHe doesn't look back at her. She turns and exits. \nEXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS \nSolara exits via the Palladium's STAGE DOOR and walks across the busy street to where TWO OF CARNEGIE'S ARMED MEN stand guard around an ENCLOSURE OF CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE. TOWNSFOLK wait in line with bowls and buckets. \nOne of the guards recognizes Solara and lets her cut to the front of the line. He punches two holes in her ration card and lets her inside the chain-link enclosure. \nInside is an OLD RUSTED SPIGOT attached to a pipe emerging from the earth. Solara cranks hard on the handle - it takes a few pulls before the water comes, and then only at a weak trickle; it will take a while to fill the canteen. \nINT. PALLADIUM - MAIN LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nAs Eli sits at the bar, a SHADOW comes into view and looms large over him. Hog is standing behind him, glaring, cutting a menacing figure in his armored cycle leathers. \nSolara senses trouble brewing and moves off, taking Eli's canteen away into the back room. \nHOG That was my cat. \nEli doesn't turn. Just looks straight ahead. Impossible to read him behind those mirrored goggles. Utterly inscrutable. \nELI Fine specimen. \nHOG I saw you push him off the bar. \nELI I didn't push him. \nHOG You raised your hand at him. \nELI Sorry. It won't happen again. \nThe bartender looks at Hog nervously. \nBARTENDER Hey, how about another drink, Hog? \nHOG That cat's been comin' in here for nigh on two years. It got more right to be here than you. Who the fuck do you think you are? \nELI I don't want any trouble. \nHog grabs him by the arm. \nHOG Well, that's too bad, `cause- \nBlink. Suddenly Hog's head is pinned to the bar by nothing more than Eli's thumb. Pressed deep into a nerve cluster in his neck. Eli leans in close as Hog whimpers, paralyzed. \nELI I know you. Murderer of innocent travelers on the road. You're going to spend eternity drowning in a lake of fire for the things that you've done. Did you know that? \nThe other bikers stand and approach, the OTHER CUSTOMERS following suit. Eli senses the trouble gathering behind him. \nELI You go on back to your table and I'll be on my way. All right? \nIt's all Hog can do to just barely nod his head. Eli releases his thumb. Hog staggers backward, gasping for breath. \nEli stands and makes toward the door, but the bikers and other patrons have moved to block his exit. \nBURLY PATRON You push Hog, you push all of us. \nEli sighs, looks down at the floor. He's been pushed one time too many today. For the first time, we see anger in his face. \nELI Cursed be the ground because of you. By toil shall you eat of it. Thorns and thistles shall it sprout for you. From the ground were you taken. For dust you are. \nThe patrons look at Eli strangely. Who is this guy? \nEli reaches back and draws the samurai sword. Carves a line in the dirt at his feet with the tip of the blade. \nELI And to dust you shall return. \nAs she turns for the door: \nELI You're Carnegie's woman? \nCLAUDIA Why do you ask? \nELI Just making conversation is all. Haven't had one of those in a while. Not a real one, leastways. \nClaudia smiles. Neither has she. \nCLAUDIA He found me in the outland. I was sixteen, my family had been... well, they were gone. There was just me and my baby. \nELI You had a baby? \nCLAUDIA I'd met some men on the road. Bad men. They... \nBEAT. She trails off, struggling with this unhappy memory. Eli gets it, raises a hand reassuringly. \nELI It's all right. \nCLAUDIA I was on the road for a year after that. I couldn't feed myself, let alone my little girl. And then Bill found us and he promised he'd take care of us. He told me he was going to make a place where we could be safe. And he did. He did all that. He built this whole town. He kept us safe. And he raised that child like she was his own. He's been so good to both of us. He saved us, really. \nThere's a bittersweet quality to Claudia's words. As though there is more to the story than she is telling. \nEli pulls out a chair at the table, offers it to her. \nELI You want to eat some? \nShe smiles and sits. Eli sits across from her. \nELI When did you go blind? In the war? You get caught in a flash? \nCLAUDIA No, I was born this way. I think I'm lucky like that. \nELI Lucky? \nCLAUDIA It's not like I ever knew what I'm missing. I was already used to being like this by the time... by the time it all happened. So I got around pretty good even when I was on my own. And now it's easy. I know every creaky old floorboard in here, and it's not like I ever go any place else. Bill would never allow it. He worries about me so much. \nAgain, bittersweet. The sense that Claudia feels trapped. Thinking about it begins to upset her. She gets up. \nCLAUDIA I should go. He'll be wondering where I am. \nEli stands, escorts her to the door and opens it. \nCLAUDIA Thank you. I enjoyed our conversation. \nELI So did I. \nEli closes the door, then sits back at the table. \nINT. PALLADIUM - CARNEGIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nCarnegie washes, looking at himself in the old dressing-room mirror. He sees Claudia enter the room in its dim reflection. \nCARNEGIE You took your time in there. How long does it take to deliver a plate of food and some water? \nA subtly accusing tone. It makes Claudia nervous. \nCLAUDIA He wanted to talk. \nCARNEGIE Oh? What about? \nCLAUDIA Nothing really. He asked me what it was like to be blind. \nCARNEGIE He tell you anything about him? \nCLAUDIA No. I don't think he likes to talk about himself much. \nCARNEGIE Yeah, I got that. \nClaudia moves to the bedside, begins to undress. \nCLAUDIA I don't think he's going to change his mind by morning. I don't think he's going to stay. \nCARNEGIE What makes you say that? \nCLAUDIA Just strikes me as the kind of man who's of a mind, is all. Doesn't seem like the type to go changing it once it's set. \nCARNEGIE Well, we'll just see about that. \nCLAUDIA You saw him. He's not like the others. You won't be able to smooth- talk him and wrap him around your finger like you usually do. \nCARNEGIE Who said anything about me? (BEAT) I'm sending Solara. \nClaudia reacts suddenly to this. Shocked and angry. \nCLAUDIA You're doing what? CARNEGIE You know how often these walkers get laid? Never. Least not by anything living or willing. Girl like her can be very persuasive. \nShe slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the buttons of his shirt. \nSOLARA They're all that kind of man. He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step. \nELI I'm not. \nShe is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And then she seems a little insulted. \nSOLARA They told me you were crazy. Maybe they were right. \nEli opens the door for her. \nELI I'm sorry. Good night. \nSuddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye. \nSOLARA Please don't make me leave. I have to stay the night. If I don't... \nELI If you don't, what? \nSOLARA He'll hurt my mom. \nELI Who will? Carnegie? \nShe nods, fighting back a tear. This angers Eli. \nELI Maybe he and I oughta have words. \nHe goes for the door handle, but she stops him. \nSOLARA No! Please, don't! \nELI He's hurting you. He's hurting your mother. He's- \nSOLARA He's my dad. \nBEAT. Eli moves his hand away from the door. \nSOLARA Look, if you want to help me, just let me stay here tonight. We don't have to do anything. I'll sleep on the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my dad that we had a good time. I'll be no trouble, I swear. \nShe looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer the teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl. \nELI You want to have a conversation? \nShe smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek. \nLATER \nEli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At first, it appears as though they have nothing to say. \nELI You know, you don't have to be afraid of me. What happened down there in the bar... \nSOLARA I'm not afraid of you. I know you didn't start that trouble. When I first saw you, I knew you weren't the type to go looking for it. \nELI How'd you know that? \nSOLARA My mom says I'm a good judge of character. She says I can read people. That I know a good man when I see one. \nShe smiles. Eli is surprised to find himself smiling back. \nSOLARA So... you're pretty old, right? \nEli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question. \nSOLARA I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't seen too many people your age. How old are you exactly? \nELI You know, I don't rightly remember. \nSOLARA But you're old enough. I mean, you remember what it was like? In the world before? \nEli nods. \nSOLARA What was it like? \nEli thinks about this. Dredging through old, old memories. \nELI Better than this. (BEAT) People lived longer back then. Longer than me. Some were more than a hundred years old. \nSolara smiles like she's having her leg pulled. \nSOLARA Come on. \nELI I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's not the same. If you're sick or you're weak or you're old you won't last long out on the road. \nSOLARA So how come you have? \nBEAT. Eli thinks. Should he or shouldn't he? \nShe looks down, sad. She likes this guy. She doesn't want him to leave. Eli can sense her sadness. \nELI Are you hungry? \nSOLARA I guess a little. \nELI There's some food on the table over there. Let's eat. \nShe walks over to where the dinner tray is covered by a small cloth. She whips it away - to reveal ELI'S RAT nibbling on a piece of cheese. Solara SHRIEKS and backs away. \nThe rat scurries down the table leg and leaps up onto Eli's shoulder, just as afraid of her as she is of it. \nELI It's okay, it's okay. He's with me. (to the rat) Don't be afraid, pal. This is Solara. She's our friend. \nSolara approaches warily. Reaches out and strokes him. The rat scurries up her arm. She almost shrieks again. \nELI It's okay. It means he likes you. \nSOLARA It does? ELI Trust me, if he didn't like you, you'd know about it. \nSolara pets the rat on her shoulder. Then: \nSOLARA Did you really mean that? \nELI Mean what? \nSOLARA That I'm your friend. \nBEAT. Eli finds himself surprised that he admitted such a thing. When is the last time he had someone he could call a friend? He can't even remember. \nELI Sure. \nShe smiles. Giggles as the rat's whiskers tickle her ear. \nEli breaks the cheese in two and gives half to Solara. She's about to eat but stops as Eli clasp his hands in prayer. \nELI Our father, we thank you for this meal which you have been so gracious to place before us. \nUnsure of what to do, Solara mimics Eli, putting her hands together and bowing her head. \nELI We thank you for a warm bed and a roof over our heads on a cold night such as this. (BEAT) And we thank you for the gift of friendship in these hard times. \nSolara looks at him, touched by that. \nELI Amen. (BEAT) You say that last part too. \nSOLARA Amen. And now we eat? \nELI And now we eat. \nThey sit and eat together, sharing the simple meal. \nPULL OUT from the window as they eat, away from the theater. Away from the town and its flickering points of torchlight. Moving farther and farther away until the entire town is consumed by the darkness of the world. \nEXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAWN \nThe pale sun rises over the town. To establish: \nINT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - MORNING \nWhat was once the theater's COSTUME ROOM - OLD MANNEQUINS still stand around in the corners, creating an eerie feel. \nCarnegie and Claudia sit at a DINING TABLE, eating breakfast in silence. A third place is set, but no-one is seated there. \nSolara enters and sits down without a word. \nCARNEGIE Good morning, Solara. \nSolara doesn't say anything. \nCARNEGIE I said good morning, Solara. \nSOLARA Morning, dad. \nCARNEGIE How was your night? Did you sleep well? \nClaudia appears perturbed by Carnegie's subtle probing. Solara flashes him a frosty look. \nSOLARA I did like you asked. Isn't that what you really want to know? Just come out and say it. \nCarnegie glares at her sternly. \nCARNEGIE You don't speak to your father like that. When I ask you a civil question, I expect a civil answer. \nSolara lowers her head, scorned. Carnegie continues eating. \nCARNEGIE Did he say anything? \nEXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS \nCarnegie races from the lobby entrance and looks up at the open window to Eli's room. He could have easily jumped. \nRedridge emerges onto the street behind him. \nREDRIDGE Something wrong, boss? \nCARNEGIE Something wrong? Something wrong? The walker's gone! \nREDRIDGE That can't be. I had a man outside his room the whole time. \nCARNEGIE He jumped out the window, you idiot! You didn't think to put a man outside the fucking window? (beat; fuming) Find him. Now! \nREDRIDGE Boss, he could be anywhere. He... (REALIZATION) A battery. Didn't he say something about a battery? \nThey turn to face the engineer's storefront - just as ELI EMERGES ONTO THE STREET, shotgun still in his hand. \nEVERYBODY FREEZES. Like a wild west stand-off. Redridge's fingers play over the butt of the pistol on his hip. \nBEAT as time hangs perfectly still for a second... and then ALL HELL BREAKS LOOSE. \nRedridge draws and FIRES, SHATTERING A PARKING METER just inches from Eli and showering quarters all over the sidewalk. \nEli rushes along the sidewalk, RETURNING FIRE. The shot wings Redridge in the shoulder. He goes down, wounded. \nCarnegie dives for cover as FOUR MORE GUNMEN rush from the theater. Carnegie waves frantically in Eli's direction. \nCARNEGIE Go! Go! \nThey spot Eli sprinting away and rush off in pursuit. \nCarnegie gets to his feet and storms back inside the theater. \nINT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nSolara and Claudia watch through the window. Turn suddenly when they hear the door slam open behind them. \nCarnegie stands in the doorway, glaring at them. \nEXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - CONTINUOUS \nLOCAL RESIDENTS scream and rush to and fro in panic as Eli darts along the boardwalk. \nCARNEGIE'S GUNMEN pursue, firing their rifles wildly on the run. The bullets splinter wood, pierce barrels and crates, narrowly missing Eli as he dashes, keeping his head down. \nEli aims the shotgun and FIRES without even looking. The shot HITS A GUNMAN SQUARE IN THE CHEST, dropping him to the dirt. \nEli hits the deck, diving for cover behind a JUNKPILE as more gunfire ricochets all around him. He takes a moment to collect himself, reloads the shotgun. \nThe three remaining gunmen close in on the junkpile warily. \nEli signs a cross over himself with the shotgun, looks to the sky and offers up a silent prayer. Then emerges from around the junkpile back into the street. All three gunmen OPEN FIRE, their bullets whipping past on either side of him. \nIn one swift motion Eli raises the shotgun and FIRES. Three shots in quick succession. And then there is silence. Smoke wisps from the shotgun's sawn-off barrel. \nThe three gunmen LIE DEAD IN THE STREET. One hit square in the chest. The other two each have maybe one half of their heads remaining. \nEli looks around. He's right at the end of the main road, the perimeter where the town meets the open desert. He's free. \nAnd then, A GIRL'S SCREAM. Distant but unmistakable. \nEli whips around. In the upstairs window of the theater, Carnegie shoves Solara roughly against the wall. Barking angrily at her, shaking her. \nEli looks at the road. Then up at the theater. Then back to the road again. \nELI (quietly; to himself) It ain't your concern. Stay on the path. \nBut he sounds less resolute now than before. Until today this was always a simple decision for him to make. But now... \nELI Dammit... \nHe marches back toward the theater, stepping over the fallen bodies of the gunmen, re-loading his shotgun as he goes. \nEXT. PALLADIUM - CONTINUOUS \nRedridge finally manages to clamber back up to his feet, wincing as he clutches his painful shoulder wound. \nHe looks up just in time to see Eli coming right at him. Without breaking stride, he COLD-COCKS Redridge in the jaw with the shotgun, sending him back to the deck, out cold. \nINT. PALLADIUM - DINING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEli kicks the door wide open, finds Carnegie holding Solara against the wall. She sobs, terrified. Eli levels the shotgun at Carnegie's head. \nELI Let her go. \nCARNEGIE That cannon of yours casts a pretty wide net. I don't reckon you can hit me without hitting her. \nBEAT. Eli stops and turns back to face her. \nELI It's dangerous in the outland. I wouldn't want you to get hurt. \nSOLARA I'll be safe so long as I'm with you. I know it. \nEli sighs. He's not getting through to her. So now comes the harsh truth of it: \nELI You don't want this life. I gotta do what I gotta do. Don't have no choice in it. But you do. And I can't let you choose this. You don't want to be like me. You don't want to spend your life alone. \nSolara steps closer, her eyes pleading. \nSOLARA If I came with you, I wouldn't be alone. And neither would you. \nA long BEAT as Eli considers this. For a moment it appears as though Solara might have won him over. But then: \nELI I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best you just go on back to town. \nHe turns and walks off, leaving her in the road. She stands there, furious, screaming at his back as he walks away. \nSOLARA Fine! I'll do just that! I had a life there! A family! I didn't ask you to save me! I didn't ask you for anything! \nHe doesn't turn or acknowledge her at all. Just keeps walking off into the horizon. Getting smaller all the time. \nSolara stands there in the road, weeping. All alone. \nSOLARA (SOFTLY) Fine. \nShe turns and walks back in the direction she came. \nEXT. DESERT TOWN - BARNYARD - DAY \nA small, penned-in area to the rear of the Palladium containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals. Goats, sheep, geese, pigs. Mostly mangy, sad-looking specimens. \nCarnegie stands in the yard, tossing handfuls of animal feed from a nearby sack onto the ground. He watches with satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed. \nClaudia emerges from the theater with an ice-pack. \nCARNEGIE Thank you, darling. \nCarnegie applies it to his jaw, red and swollen from Eli's pistol-whip. Redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling. \nREDRIDGE He killed four of my men and walked out of town without a scratch. They shot off a hundred rounds at him and he didn't get hit once. I never even heard of anything like that. \nCarnegie doesn't appear to be listening. He is lost in a world of his own as he tends to the farm animals. \nCARNEGIE You know, I always thought of myself as a shepherd. Bringing together the wayward and the lost. Tending to my flock. But all the things I want to do, I can't do them on my own. The one thing I've needed is the one thing that's always been missing. Then one day it walks right into town - so close I can almost touch it - and then walks right on out again. \nCarnegie finally looks up from his animals, at Redridge. \nCARNEGIE I want you to put a crew together and go out after him. \nREDRIDGE He's not going to work for you. I think he's made that plain. \nCARNEGIE I'm not interested in him any more. I only want the book he's carrying. \nREDRIDGE If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting down this maniac in the outland, I need to know it's gonna be worth it. I need to know what's so special about this goddamn book. \nBEAT as Carnegie considers this. \nCARNEGIE You have no idea. You're too young, you don't remember the world before. But I do. I remember. \nHe turns back to his animals, summoning up old memories. \nCARNEGIE When I was a kid my parents used to read that book every goddamn day. My mother, she'd read it along with this smooth-talking preacher on the TV screen. They used to be able to beam these guys right into your house, into every house in the world, through the air. Like magic. (BEAT) She worked two jobs and she sent every spare penny she had to that fucking guy on the TV. My old man, he'd read that book, then he'd get liquored up and kick my ass, tell me all about the power and the glory and how I was going to burn forever in hell for the sins I was born with. He made sure he beat it into me good. \nHe snaps out of his reverie and looks at Redridge. \nCARNEGIE Don't you see? It's not just any book. (MORE) \nCARNEGIE (cont'd) It has the power to motivate people. It can give them hope, it can terrify them. It can shape them. Control them. (BEAT) Do you remember how I built this town? It wasn't done with force, and it wasn't done just with water. It was done with the power of words. I created this place out of nothing, because people believed in a promise that I sold to them. Those guys on the TV, they were richer than you could ever dream, and it was all built the same way. With words. With promises. And with that book. (BEAT) That book is a weapon. Aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate. Just imagine what I could do with it. \nREDRIDGE Boss... we're running out of water and the people are running out of patience. You're trying to tell me that a book is going to keep them in line? \nCARNEGIE Oh, it'll do much more than that. The water in this town may run dry, but faith - that springs eternal! And that faith will help turn this town into a city. And this city into a nation. It will help me build a new world. In my image. People will come from far and wide to hear what's inside of it. They'll follow me anywhere just to get a taste of it. And they'll do whatever I tell them. \nAs usual, Carnegie's slick rhetoric has worked - Redridge has totally bought into it. Claudia, however, looks appalled. \nREDRIDGE And what if this book don't work? What if it don't say what you want it to say? \nCARNEGIE Oh, it'll say what I want, I can promise you that. Because I'm going to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts that work for me and make the rest whatever I need it to be. (BEAT) A new bible, for a new world. \nHe reaches out and takes Claudia by the hand. \nCARNEGIE What do you think, darling? A whole new world, to do with as we will. Won't that be grand? \nShe smiles halfheartedly, but it's clear she is mortified. \nShe runs out across the forecourt, onto the road. \nA FEMALE FIGURE is hunched by the side of the road about fifty yards up ahead. Hard to see what she's doing from here. \nSLUMPED FEMALE Hello? Is anybody there? \nSolara starts walking toward her. \nThe woman has her back to Solara. She's on her knees, muttering to herself. Gathering objects up from the road. \nAs Solara moves closer, we see that the woman is struggling with an UPTURNED SHOPPING CART. Stuck in a roadside ditch, its contents spilled out next to a few BRACKEN BUSHES. \nWe see her face now. It's the SAME YOUNG WOMAN from before. The same shopping cart. The same trap. \nSOLARA Are you all right? \nThe woman looks around, sees Solara standing nearby. She's shocked to see that it's a girl. \nYOUNG WOMAN Oh. Yes, I'm fine. Thank you. You go along, I'll be okay. \nSOLARA You look like you need some help. \nYOUNG WOMAN No, really! I'm fine. Really... I need a man to help. Not you. You just keep along. Please. \nThe woman seems anxious to get rid of her. Tries to indicate the threat silently with her eyes, but Solara doesn't get it. \nSOLARA It'll just take a minute. \nShe steps into the ditch and starts to haul the cart out. \nYOUNG WOMAN Really, it's fine! Please! \nToo   late. THREE ROAD BRIGANDS POUNCE FROM THE BUSHES. Every bit   as brutish and horrifying as the group that Eli killed on the   road in our opening. They grab Solara and drag her from the   road into the desert, screaming and kicking all the way. \nYOUNG WOMAN Let her go! She ain't got nothing! \nThe BRIGAND LEADER looks Solara up and down lustfully. \nBRIGAND LEADER I ain't too sure about that. \nSolara is reviled by the man. He's filthy, his stench overpowering. One eye missing, just a dark, empty socket. He licks his lips, revealing a mouth almost devoid of teeth. \nYOUNG WOMAN This wasn't the deal! \nThe brigand leader lashes out and grabs her by the throat. \nBRIGAND LEADER Shut your mouth, bitch. You oughta be grateful you're getting a break. \nHe releases her. She slumps to the dirt, whimpering. \nBRIGAND LEADER Never did care much for that dried- up old snatch anyhow. \nHe looks back to the struggling Solara. \nBRIGAND LEADER This one, though... this one looks fresh. You a virgin? \nShe says nothing, just sobs helplessly. \nBRIGAND LEADER Well, let's find out. \nHe unbuckles his pants, lets them drop to his ankles. \nWe hear a sound. It's hard to place. Something like a THHUP. \nThe brigand leader is frozen in shock. His face goes pale, the blood draining from it. The two bandits holding Solara look at their leader in dismay. Staring down at his crotch. \nA quiet whimper escapes from his lips as he looks down. \nThere is an ARROW IMBEDDED IN HIS CROTCH. What was once down there is now just a bloody mess of mangled meat. More blood streams down his thighs. A real horror show. \nHe staggers backward, shrieking. Hands shaking. Staring down at the awful wound from which the long arrow shaft extends. \nThe two other brigands release Solara and whip around, scanning the horizon. They see nothing. One of them has a RIFLE. He unslings it and aims it frantically around. \nThen they both see it. Coming right at them. The most terrifying thing either has ever seen. \nELI, WALKING TOWARD THEM FROM THE ROAD, OUT OF THE SUN. His silhouette distorted in the rippling heat. An avenging angel. \nHe pulls another arrow and draws it back as the rifle bandit trains his weapon on him, finger tightening on the trigger. \nEli SHOOTS. The arrow sails through the air and RIGHT INTO THE RIFLE BARREL. The feathers at the end of the shaft plugging the muzzle tight. \nRifle bandit pulls the trigger. The gun EXPLODES, BLOWING HIS HANDS CLEAN OFF. He falls to the ground, screaming. \nEli only had two arrows. He shoulders the bow and draws his sword. All the remaining brigand has is a small knife. The two now square off at arm's length. A hopeless mismatch. \nBEAT. The knife brigand hesitates, trembling. And then RUSHES ELI WITH THE KNIFE. Eli deftly sidesteps, flourishes the sword. So quick it almost seems like he didn't move at all. \nEli wheels around and jabs a scolding finger at her. \nELI You want to stay on this road with me, don't ever let me hear you take his name in vain like that again. \nSolara is surprised by the severity of his reaction. \nSOLARA Sorry. \nEli resumes walking. \nELI God has a reason for everything being the way it is. It's not always apparent to us. But it is his plan nonetheless. \nSOLARA So, is he talking to you right now? Telling you where to go? \nELI It's not like that. It's kinda hard to explain. I'm guided by faith. \nSOLARA I don't know what that word means. \nBEAT as Eli thinks on how to explain it. \nELI It means you know something even though you don't know it. \nSolara thinks about this, shakes her head. \nSOLARA That doesn't make any sense at all. \nELI It doesn't have to. \nThey walk on. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nOn the outskirts of a small town that lies in ruins. Almost every building burned or reduced to rubble. \nExcept for one SMALL HOUSE. The building is damaged and worn but in mostly decent condition. It stands out among its surroundings for being the only structure still intact. \nThe windows are BARRED. The outer structure fortified with SHEET METAL and other custom patch-ups. The whole plot surrounded by a CHAIN-LINK FENCE TOPPED WITH RAZOR WIRE. \nEli and Solara crouch behind a pile of rubble nearby. \nSOLARA I don't get it. It looks almost... normal. Like nothing ever happened. How can it still be out here? \nELI I don't know. \nSOLARA Maybe we should look inside. There might be food. \nBEAT as Eli considers. Then stands and unhooks his shotgun. \nELI Stay behind me. \nThey approach the house cautiously. Arrive at the perimeter fence. There's a gate held in place by a PADLOCK. \nEli pulls a pair of BOLT-CUTTERS from his belt and snips the padlock free. Swings open the gate with a metallic SQUEAK. \nThey move inside, up the garden path. Though the soil in the yard is dead, it's been carefully raked and tended. WEEDS arranged in thoughtful patterns, like real flowers. \nSOLARA This is weird. \nELI Yeah. \nEli steps forward, his foot planting on a CRACKED PAVING STONE that shifts almost imperceptibly under his feet. Accompanied by a barely audible SOUND. He looks down. \nELI Shit. \nSOLARA What? \nA ROPE NOOSE suddenly whips around their feet, tightening at their ankles and YANKING THEM UPSIDE-DOWN INTO THE AIR. Eli drops his shotgun to the ground. \nThey hang there for a moment, twisting in the breeze. \nThe front door to the house SWINGS OPEN to reveal... \nAN ELDERLY COUPLE. The woman's gray hair tied into a neat bun. The man bald, squinting through wire-frame glasses. They look like the couple from Grant Wood's \"American Gothic.\" \nInstead of a pitchfork the man holds a 12-GAUGE RIOT SHOTGUN which he keeps trained from the hip on Eli and Solara. \nThey step outside, regarding their new visitors carefully. The man seems more suspicious than his wife. He drags Eli's shotgun toward him with his foot, hands it to his wife. \nELDERLY MAN Who are you? \nELI My name is Eli. This is Solara. We're travelers, that's all. We don't mean you any harm. \nELDERLY MAN You cut my padlock. I saw you. Trying to break into our house. \nELI I'm sorry. We didn't think anybody lived here. We thought it was abandoned, like all the rest. \nThis seems to annoy the man. \nELI They're worse than that. \nSOLARA What? \nELI They didn't just kill these people. (BEAT) They ate them. \nSolara is stunned. \nSOLARA They what? ELI There's a disease in the outland. Spread by eating human meat. It affects the brain. Dementia, loss of motor function. Did you notice the old woman's hands shaking? She's got it. They've both got it. \nSOLARA Oh my God... \nINT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEli and Solara re-enter. Solara looks at George nervously. He's still carrying that shotgun. \nMartha's voice drifts in from the nearby KITCHEN. \nMARTHA (O.S.) I found some meat for those sandwiches! Are you hungry? \nSOLARA No! Thank you! \nELI We really must be going. \nGEORGE So soon? \nAn unnerving glint in his eye. Eli moves toward the door. \nELI Yes, I'm afraid so. \nAs he gets to the door, George moves to intercept. Hard to tell if he's blocking his path or moving to open the door for him. A tense BEAT. \nMartha emerges from the kitchen. \nMARTHA Are you sure you won't stay? \nELI Yes. Thank you again for the tea. \nEli stares George down. Reluctantly, George steps aside. Eli opens the door and escorts Solara outside. \nEXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nEli and Solara emerge into the sunlight. Walk down the garden path. And FREEZE IN THEIR TRACKS. \nTHE ARMED VEHICLES ARE COMING. Driving toward them out of the horizon in a hazy cloud of dust. \nSOLARA Oh no... it's my dad. It's his men. \nELI Are you sure? \nSOLARA I recognize the cars. \nELI Back inside. \nEli bundles Solara back into the house. George stands in the doorway, squinting at the approaching convoy. \nINT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nGeorge follows them back in, furious. \nGEORGE What did you bring upon us? \nMARTHA George? What's wrong? \nGEORGE A whole convoy of armed degenerates, that's what's wrong! Coming here for them! And they led them right to us! \nMartha rushes to the window, pulls aside the lace curtain. Outside she sees the armored vehicles SCREECHING TO A HALT. \nThe men spill out from the vehicles and take cover behind them, locking and loading weapons. \nMARTHA Oh no they don't... \nShe rushes across the room, teeth gritted with determination. \nGEORGE Martha, what are you doing? \nMARTHA I finally got this house just the way I want it. I'm not going to let anybody tear it apart! \nShe goes to the couch and yanks off the seat cushions. Underneath is a WOODEN LID which she throws open to reveal: \nA HUGE CACHE OF WEAPONS. Automatic rifles. Shotguns. Pistols. Grenades. And enough ammunition for everything. \nShe pulls out an M-60 MACHINE-GUN, slings the strap over her shoulder and locks in a CHAIN OF BULLETS. She looks like a post-apocalyptic Martha Stewart. \nSOLARA Where did you get all this stuff? \nGeorge pulls out an AK-47, slots in a magazine. \nSolara sits across the room, in the corner, sobbing. \nELI It's all right. We're going to be all right. Trust me. \nMORE GUNFIRE splinters the window frame above his head. \nELI You remember what I told you about faith? \nShe nods. \nEli peeks out and FIRES OUT THE WINDOW, dropping one of the enemy gunmen with a crack shot. Ducks back down as the return fire impacts around him. \nELI We're going to get out of this alive. Both of us. I know. \nSOLARA Because God told you? \nELI Because God told me. \nAmidst all the chaos and gunfire, George has been listening to this exchange. \nGEORGE What about us? \nBEAT. \nELI He didn't mention you. \nBEAT. George chambers a round and RESUMES FIRING. \nEXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nRedridge's men continue the hail of gunfire. Six of them dead now, six more still standing. No lessening of fire from inside the house. They're losing. \nRedridge races between the vehicles, ducking from gunfire until he makes it to the back of the Dodge Caravan. Pops the trunk and pulls out a ROCKET-PROPELLED GRENADE LAUNCHER. \nHe sets it on his shoulder, rests on the trunk to steady his aim. And FIRES. The rocket screams toward its target, tearing through the chain fence and TEARING AN ENTIRE CORNER FROM THE HOUSE in a fiery explosion. \nINT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nFilled with smoke. The sounds of COUGHING. \nDazed, George pushes his way through the smoke, waving his arms to clear it. A BLOODY GASH on his forehead. \nGEORGE Martha? Martha! \nHe finds her lying on the tile floor in what remains of the kitchen. Or at least her top half. The rest of her is gone. \nGeorge slumps to his knees with tear-filled eyes. Takes his wife tenderly by the hand for a moment. \nThen the anger returns. He gets up and turns, consumed now by a wild fury. Firing with rage over the torn brick wall. He CLIPS ANOTHER GUNMAN IN THE HEAD, killing him. \nGeorge moves back toward the LIVING ROOM, firing as he goes. \nEXT. HOUSE - CONTINUOUS \nRedridge moves between the cars again, staying behind cover. George's hail of gunfire has them pinned down. \nREDRIDGE We got any more of those RPGs? \nCARNEGIE GUNMAN #3 That was it. \nREDRIDGE Screw this. \nRedridge jumps into the driver's seat of the minivan, turns the key in the ignition. Jams the accelerator down with the butt of his rifle, then shifts the transmission into DRIVE. \nREDRIDGE Get clear! \nThe gunmen leap clear as the minivan HURTLES TOWARD THE HOUSE, engine roaring. CRASHES THROUGH THE CHAIN FENCE. \nINT. HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nEli looks up from cover and see the van coming RIGHT AT HIM. He dives clear as the van CRASHES THROUGH THE WALL INTO THE LIVING ROOM. It SMASHES INTO THE FAR WALL, finally coming to a stop. \nMore dust and debris, more coughing. Eli tries to get up, but winces in pain. Puts his hand to his side, it comes back WET WITH BLOOD. A bad wound. He covers it with his coat, stands and moves through the smoke. \nELI Solara? \nSOLARA (O.S.) Eli! \nHe finds her in the smoke. She embraces him. \nELI Are you all right? \nSOLARA I'm fine. \nAs the smoke clears, Solara sees George PINNED AGAINST THE WALL BY THE MINIVAN. His body crushed. Dead. \nSOLARA Oh God... \nEli gathers up his stuff into his pack. Shoulders it and goes to pick up his sword, but Redridge puts his boot on it. \nREDRIDGE No weapons. \nEli still has a half-dozen guns trained on him. He turns and walks away, toward the road. As he passes Solara: \nELI I told you we'd both live. Now do you have faith? \nA tear runs down Solara's cheek as she watches him walk away. \nRedridge grabs her by the arm and pulls her toward the vehicles as his men load up and prepare to move out. \nIN THE REARMOST VEHICLE \nSolara sits in the back seat, staring out the rear window as it drives down the road at the tail end of the convoy. \nShe watches as Eli moves away down the road, getting smaller and smaller until he is just a speck on the horizon. \nShe bursts into floods of uncontrollable tears. \nLATER \nSolara in the back seat, calmer now. The tears dried on her cheeks. She sits staring blankly at the DRIVER in front. \nAnd then she LUNGES VIOLENTLY FORWARD. Clawing and biting at the driver, who struggles to fight her off. His hands come off the wheel and the car FISHTAILS WILDLY. \nREDRIDGE'S VEHICLE \nThe DRIVER sees something odd in the rear-view mirror. \nDRIVER What the hell...? \nRedridge turns to see the car behind VEERING ERRATICALLY then SLAMMING ON THE BRAKES, stopping in the middle of the road. \nREDRIDGE Stop, stop! \nThe car screeches to a halt. Redridge watches through the rear window as the driver's side door opens and the driver is KICKED OUT ONTO THE ASPHALT. \nThe door closes again, the engine revs and the car TURNS AROUND, racing back down the road in the direction it came. \nREDRIDGE Shit. Turn around! \nDRIVER We ain't got the gas for it! \nREDRIDGE She's getting away! \nDRIVER We got the book! And we got barely enough gas to make it back as it is! We can't go chasin' her! \nBEAT. Redridge knows he's right. \nREDRIDGE Stupid little bitch... (BEAT) Drive on. \nThe car moves on, following the rest of the convoy. \nEXT. HOUSE - DAY \nSolara screeches the car to a halt outside the smoking wreckage of the besieged house. She runs from the vehicle to where ELI'S SWORD lies in the dirt and grabs it up. \nEXT. ROAD - DUSK \nSolara races down the road in the car, pedal to the metal. \nSOLARA Come on, come on... \nEventually, she sees him. At first just a dot on the horizon. But unmistakably Eli. By now, she'd know him anywhere. \nSuddenly the engine SPLUTTERS. She checks the fuel gauge; the needle deep in the red. She pounds the wheel in frustration. \nSOLARA No... No! \nThe car grinds to a halt, dead. She flings open the door and leaps out of the vehicle, rushing after Eli on foot. \nON ELI. As always, his pace steady and slow. The sun directly ahead of him as it sets on the horizon. Headed always west. \nSolara is running up behind him, a hundred yards back. \nSOLARA Eli! Eli! \nHe doesn't stop or look back. Just keeps on walking. \nShe finally catches up with him, breathing hard, exhausted. \nSOLARA Eli... \nELI Thought you'd gone back to town. \nSOLARA I can't go back there. Eli, I'm so sorry. \nEli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick, poking around ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot. He steps carefully. \nELI Watch your footing. Step where I step. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY \nMore buildings are still standing here, but they're nothing more than great dead monoliths. Solara looks up at the blasted skyscrapers - she's never seen anything like it. \nThe buildings loom over her like giant tombstones. It scares her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world. \nSOLARA This... this is the world before? \nELI What's left of it. \nThey keep walking, passing the TOPPLED TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FISHERMAN'S WHARF - DAY \nOnce a bustling oceanside tourist spot, now a ghost town. \nEli and Solara walk along the litter-strewn street, passing the old RIPLEY'S BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT and WAX MUSEUMS. The celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition, but slumped at their feet are CHARRED HUMAN SKELETONS. \nEli is struggling now. He looks pale from the blood loss. His breathing labored. Solara takes him by the arm to help him. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO - PIER 39 - DAY \nA dead, ruined place, like everywhere else. We hear the sound of SEAGULLS nearby - the only sign of life at all. \nEli and Solara walk along the pier, until they reach its end. The original end has long since collapsed into the sea, but a RICKETY HAND-MADE ROPE BRIDGE has been affixed to the pier's sheared-off edge. \nEli and Solara stand at the pier's end, looking out to sea. \nELI Do you see that? \nSOLARA I see it. Is that it? \nELI That's it. \nReveal now that the rope-bridge leads out across the bay to: \nALCATRAZ ISLAND \nLooking much the same as it always has, old and dilapidated. The coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look. It feels almost like a mythic place - the \"promised land\" Eli has sought for so many years. \nA tattered STARS AND STRIPES still flutters in the breeze atop the prison lighthouse. \nEXT. BAY ROPE BRIDGE - DAY \nEli and Solara make their way carefully across the bridge. It feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay, the waters below close enough to lap around their ankles. \nEXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY \nEli and Solara arrive at the prison gates. Securely locked. As they inspect it for a possible way to enter: \nVOICE (O.S.) Who goes there? \nThey look up. A GUARD in paramilitary fatigues is stationed in one of the perimeter towers. Training a rifle on them. \nALCATRAZ GUARD Identify yourselves! \nIn the opposite tower ANOTHER GUARD has his rifle trained on them too. Eli looks up, raises his hands. \nELI My name is Elijah Stone. I have a message for your boss. I need you to tell him that I have a King James Bible in my possession. \nBEAT. \nALCATRAZ GUARD Remain where you are! Do not attempt to move or you will be fired upon! \nKeeping the gun trained on them, the tower guard uses his free hand to talk into a WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO. We don't hear the conversation. All Eli and Solara can do is wait. \nThe guard puts away his radio and shouts back down: \nALCATRAZ GUARD Be prepared to surrender any weapons at the gate! \nBEAT. And then the massive front gates SLOWLY OPEN ON MECHANICAL RUNNERS with the low groan of rusted iron. \nEli and Solara look at each other, then step gingerly inside. \nINT. ALCATRAZ - MAIN GATES - CONTINUOUS \nAs soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS. Not U.S. military, more like a semi- official militia. But every bit as deadly. \nEli and Solara raise their hands. A pair of SOLDIERS take Eli's pack and sword, pat them both down for other weapons. \nSOLDIER They're clean. \nThe soldiers before them part - to reveal a THIN, BALDING MAN wearing spectacles. He wears Kevlar body armor over his tweed jacket and tie. Professorial, academic. \nEli, Solara and Lombardi sit at one of the long lunch-room tables. The two armed guards keep watch nearby. \nELI Do you have something you can write with? \nLOMBARDI Mmm? Oh, yes of course! \nHe pulls a pen from his pocket, motions to one of the guards. \nLOMBARDI Could you please bring us some writing paper? \nThe guard nods and moves toward the door. As he does so: \nELI Bring a lot of it. \nINT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX \nCarnegie looks at the open bible, jaw hanging loose, his complexion ashen. Like he's just been slapped in the face. \nREDRIDGE What? What is it? \nINT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY \nThe guard brings a THICK SHEAF OF WRITING PAPER to the cafeteria table, sets it down by Lombardi. \nELI Are you ready? \nLOMBARDI What exactly am I writing? \nELI Pay close attention and write down every word exactly as I say it. \nEli removes his goggles. Solara can't believe what she sees. \nHis eyes are pale, milky-white, dead. TOTALLY BLIND. \nELI The First Book of Moses called Genesis. Chapter one, verse one. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. Verse two. The earth was without form, and void; and darkness was on the face of the deep. And the spirit of God was hovering over the face of the waters. Verse three. And God said, \"Let there be light,\" and there was light. \nLombardi hurriedly writes down every word. \nINT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX \nCarnegie sits at his desk, still in shock. Eli's bible sits open on the desk before him. \nA BRAILLE BIBLE. \nClaudia is ushered in by a guard. \nCLAUDIA What's wrong? \nHe rushes forward and thrusts the bible into her hands. \nCARNEGIE You told me once that you know how to read this. This blind language. \nCLAUDIA Well, a long time ago, when I was a little girl... \nCARNEGIE You're going to read it for me. Every word. And I'm going to write it down. Start at the beginning. \nAs Carnegie hunts on his desk for a paper and pen, Claudia opens the book and trails her fingertips across the raised lettering. \nFor a moment there is a glimmer of recognition... a faint smile... but then it fades as Carnegie turns back to her, eagerly clutching the writing materials. \nCLAUDIA I'm sorry. It's been so long. I don't remember. I don't remember any of it. \nCarnegie is aghast. BEAT as the anger swells within him, threatening to explode... \nCARNEGIE God fucking dammit! \nHe swipes violently at the bible, knocking it out of Claudia's hands. He grabs it up and tries to rip it in two, but it's too thick to tear. Red-faced with rage, he tosses it out over the box balcony. It lands somewhere in the dark auditorium below, between the rows of gutted theater seats. \nAs he paces angrily back past Claudia: \nCLAUDIA Bill, is there something- \nCARNEGIE Just go. Just get out of my sight. \nHe slumps in his chair, exhausted and furious. Claudia sadly turns and leaves him alone with his thoughts. \nINT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - NIGHT \nSome considerable time later. Great stacks of paper have been filled with Lombardi's handwriting. \nLombardi's pen races across the paper, struggling to keep up with Eli's recitation. \nSolara is curled up on a nearby bench, asleep. Eli's coat covering her to keep her warm. \nEli clutches his wound painfully as he continues to recite. He looks paler now than ever. Close to death. \nELI (V.O.) Dear Lord, thank you for giving me the strength and the conviction to complete the task you entrusted to me. Thank you for guiding me straight and true, through the many obstacles in my path.

FOREST - DAWN \nBare as all hell. The trees stripped of their bark and white like ghosts. Some torn violently from their roots and felled. \nSTARK GRAY SUNLIGHT shafts between the trees, clouded by a creeping fog that obscures the true color of everything. A LIGHT SNOW flutters. The world monochrome, lifeless and cold. \nA CAT prowls across the dead earth. Barely recognizable as the domestic breed it might once have been. Its fur mangy and rank, body rib-thin from starvation. Entirely feral. \nIt moves slowly, cautiously. Sniffing the air, scanning the forest, alert. Trusting nothing of its surroundings. It paces across a leaf-strewn clearing, closing stealthily on: \nA DEAD MAN, splayed face-down in the earth. His feet bare. Face frozen in a grim death mask. A GAPING GUNSHOT WOUND in his head, the dried blood caked around it matting his hair. \nAs the cat moves closer, approaching warily: \nP.O.V. FROM ACROSS THE CLEARING \nAbout thirty yards away. Someone is watching. Waiting. SLOW, DEEP BREATHS, heard through a GASMASK RESPIRATOR. \nCLOSE ON A PAIR OF INDUSTRIAL GOGGLES \nThe MIRRORED LENSES reflecting the forest clearing, locked onto the cat. The slow, metered breathing continues. \nTHE CAT slows, but continues pacing toward the corpse. More cautious than ever. It inches forward, sniffing at the body. \nON THE WATCHER. Crouched behind the mangled stump of a felled tree. Concealed beneath a camouflaging mesh of leaves, twigs and bracken. A \"ghillie suit\" of the kind used by snipers. \nTHE CAT sniffs at the dead man's hand, frozen by death in a grotesquely contorted claw. The animal still unsure. Looks around again, checking its surroundings for predators. \nTHE WATCHER moves almost imperceptibly. The leaves covering him rustle ever so slightly as we hear - just barely - the familiar creaking sound of a BOW STRING BEING DRAWN TAUT. \nTHE CAT hears it. Looks up, alert. Staring right at the watcher, but he is too well camouflaged to be seen. An interminable, tense BEAT - is the prey going to flee? \nFinally, the cat turns its attention back to the carcass, nibbling gingerly at the flesh of the man's fingers. \nTHE WATCHER looses the arrow. It sails across the clearing and SKEWERS THE CAT clean through. It drops to the ground. \nTHE WATCHER STANDS, shaking off the ghillie suit, revealing him to us for the first time. \nHe wears a weather-beaten knee-length duster. Hooded sweater with more layers beneath that. Torn pants and scuffed work boots. Everything filthy and battered from years of wear. \nAlong with the goggles, his face remains obscured by a DISPOSABLE PAPER DUST MASK and a CRUDELY-FASHIONED FUR HAT with dangling ear flaps that may once itself have been a cat. \nAround his neck he wears a silver SAINT CHRISTOPHER PENDANT hanging from a frayed twine cord. \nHis name is ELI. \nHe shoulders the bow and walks across the clearing. Crouches beside the dead cat and pulls out the arrow. Wipes the blood from the shaft, then reaches down to collect the body. \nSuddenly the cat SCREECHES AND FLAILS WILDLY! Eli recoils, falling backward, stunned, as the cat - MORTALLY WOUNDED BUT FIGHTING TO THE DEATH - bites and claws desperately at him. \nEli struggles violently with the cat, wrestling it to the ground and grabbing up a HUNK OF FALLEN BRANCH. He holds the writhing animal down and CLUBS IT until it lays still. \nHe sits back, breathing harder than the dustmask will allow. He yanks it down, revealing the dirty, unshaven face beneath. Impossible to tell his age, but certainly not a young man. \nFor a moment he just sits there. Then bundles up the dead cat and returns to the mangled tree stump. Folds away his ghillie suit into a nearby RUCKSACK which he hauls up onto his back. \nA canteen dangles from the backpack, a SHOTGUN strapped to its side. Eli reaches down for his final possession - an old SAMURAI SWORD in a scabbard which he slings across his back. \nHe gazes up at the sky. A snowflake drifts down and lands on his cheek. He reaches up and brushes it away, leaving a BLACK SMEAR on his face. Not snow after all, but some kind of ASH. \nEXT. FOREST ROAD - DAY \nEli emerges from the treeline onto the cracked and ruptured asphalt. Lined by more of those ghostly, stripped-bare trees. \nHe sniffs the air, breathing it in. Checks the road in both directions. Deserted. A few yards away is the rusted, burned- out chassis of a CAR. He heads toward it. \nThe car rests half on the road, half in the adjacent ditch. Stripped of its tires and engine. In the driver's seat is a MUMMIFIED BODY. A BULLET HOLE piercing its forehead. \nEli regards the body dispassionately. Tries the door handle but it's jammed. He yanks on it harder and eventually wrenches it open. He leans in and checks the man's feet. \nThey're bare. No shoes or socks. Eli curses under his breath. \nHe leaves the car behind and heads on down the road. As he walks away, we see that the sole of one of his boots has worn loose, held in place now only by a rubber band. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \n", "test1_true": "The road has since emerged from the forest. Passing now through a wasteland of dead scrub brush and urban junk. \nThe sun beats down from directly overhead. The sky has no color to it, paper-white. The unfiltered sun's stark light leaves everything seeming bleached-out, over-exposed. \nCRANE UP as Eli walks on. On the horizon is the silhouette of a CITY. Or what was once a city. Columns of BLACK SMOKE rise from within, casting a deathly pall over the skyline. BURNED AND BROKEN SKYSCRAPERS jut out like tombstones. \nEli reaches a fork in the road and stops. The road he's on appears to wind off in the direction of the ruined city on the horizon. The other fork continues on into the wasteland. \nAfter a brief pause, Eli changes direction and heads off down the other fork, away from the city. \nEXT. ABANDONED TOWN - DAY \nLittle more than a main street lined with storefronts. Eli walks steadily along, side-stepping rubble and debris. Ignoring the petrified corpses lying in the street. \nHe passes by abandoned stores, every one picked clean. Empty shelves, smashed windows. Looted and burned. He doesn't even look inside, knowing already that he will find nothing. \nUntil he comes to a store that does cause him to stop. An old- fashioned sign squeaks on rusted hinges in the breeze. \nED'S SHOES - GENTLEMEN'S AND LADIES' FOOTWEAR \nHe steps into the doorway and pushes open the door. It swings open on its one remaining hinge before splintering away from the frame and crashing to the floor in a cloud of dust. \nINT. SHOE STORE - CONTINUOUS \nEli steps inside. Like all the others, the store has been cleaned out. Shoe racks and empty boxes strewn over the floor. The whole place reeking of dead, musty air. \nEli looks around, just to be sure. Drags his sheathed sword idly along the empty racks as he checks them. Nothing. \nAs he turns back for the door, his foot nudges against a shoe box. It's not empty. He crouches down, flips the lid off hopefully... and pulls out a LADY'S HIGH-HEELED SHOE. \nHe strokes the shoe leather with his hand. Shakes his head grimly, then tosses the shoe back into the box and leaves. \nEXT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY \nOn the outskirts of town. In disrepair - peeling paint, broken windows, damp-stained walls - but habitable. \nEli stands in the front yard, surrounded by brownish, overgrown weeds. Thinking it over. Turns to face the setting sun. It will be dark soon. He turns back toward the house. \nINT. ABANDONED HOUSE - DAY \nThe front door is sent CRASHING OPEN with a hard kick, revealing Eli silhouetted in the fading sunlight. The shotgun unhitched from his pack and held ready. He moves inside. \nAnother dead place. Flies buzzing in the still, dank air. Everything covered in a thick layer of dust but otherwise largely preserved. An eerie snapshot of a world long gone. \nKITCHEN \nEvery cupboard empty. Eli checks each one, poking around in the dark corners with his sword, but finds nothing but dust. \nHe opens the freezer, checks inside. Empty save for a small ICEBOX. The lid stuck fast with mildew and gunk. Eli digs at it with his grimy fingernails and manages to pry it open. \nInside are the wizened, petrified remains of a HUMAN HAND. Floating in slimy, discolored water. The smell vile and thick enough to make Eli retch. He quickly jams the lid back on. \nBEDROOM \nA wooden bedframe stripped clean. The dresser drawers have been emptied and lie strewn across the floor. Eli moves toward a large walk-in closet and opens the door. \nNo clothes inside - just the near-fossilized corpse of a MAN HANGING BY A NOOSE. Twisting gently back and forth. \nUnfazed, Eli crouches down and checks the man's feet. An old pair of Converse All-Stars hang limp from the man's skeletal ankles. Eli calmly sets about unlacing them. \nHe checks the size; they're a fit. He upturns each shoe and shakes the old flakes of mummified flesh from them. Discards his ruined boots and puts on the sneakers, laces them up. \nHe walks around, pacing up and down, getting a feel for the new shoes. They feel good. For the first time, he smiles. \nLATER \nEli sits in the corner, roasting the carcass of the dead cat over a small CAMPFIRE. He cleans the animal's pelts as he watches it cook. Pokes at the meat with a pen-knife, checking it for done-ness. It appears ready to eat. \nHe clasps his hands together in prayer. \nELI Dear Lord, thank you for your generosity in providing us today with this bountiful feast. \nHe speaks QUIETLY, his voice barely above a whisper. Even so, we catch the accent - a RASPY, OLD-WORLD MIDWEST DRAWL, like John Wayne or some other long-forgotten western icon. \nELI Thank you for the many gifts that you have given me. Thank you for your protection and your guidance. Thank you for bringing me this far. I know my long journey's end is near. I ask now only for the strength and the courage to complete the task that you in your infinite wisdom saw fit to bestow upon me over all men. I won't let you down. Amen. \nHe signs a cross over himself, then uses the knife to saw off a chunk of meat. Takes a bite, savoring the taste with great relish. To him, it's grade-A filet mignon. \nELI Hey. You hungry? \nIt appears as though he is talking to himself... until a RAT emerges from his coat pocket, whiskers twitching keenly. Eli offers it some meat. The rat gnaws enthusiastically at it. \nSUNDOWN \nThe last of the waning sunlight shafts through the bedroom's broken window. Eli rummages through his backpack, pulls out a SMALL PACKAGE wrapped in cloth and tied fast with string. \n", "test2_input": "CARNEGIE I've met walkers before. Not a particularly civilized bunch. Some have even taken to eating their own kind, did you know that? You wouldn't be one of those savages now, would you? \nCarnegie's gunmen look him over, inspecting him warily. \nCARNEGIE GUNMAN He ain't got the shakes. \nCarnegie's confident gaze remains fixed on Eli throughout. \nCARNEGIE Good. This is a civilized town. Under God. Do you know what that means? \nEli can't help but react at the mention of that word. \nCARNEGIE It means we have laws here. Laws set down long before any of us ever walked this earth. And one of them is, you don't eat the flesh of your brother. Else you're no better than an animal. And not welcome here. \nEli doesn't respond. Just stands there in Carnegie's gaze. \nCARNEGIE So what's your business here, friend? Walkers don't usually come into town less they want something. \nELI I had a battery needed charging and a canteen needed filling. I didn't come here looking for trouble. \nBarely noticeable, Carnegie gestures to one of the gunmen, who nods in acknowledgement and leaves. \nCARNEGIE Well, you sure as hell found it. Do you know who I am? \nELI No. \nCARNEGIE My name's Carnegie. I own this bar. I own the whole town. You've never heard of me? \nELI That's you out there on the street. \nCARNEGIE Remarkable likeness, isn't it? You'd never guess half the men who built it were blind. A small tribute from a grateful people. I was deeply touched. \nELI You had slaves build you a monument to yourself? \nThe mention of that word rankles Carnegie. He walks around the desk toward Eli, waves an admonishing finger at him. \nCARNEGIE Don't call them slaves. That's an old word. I'm not a slaver. I'm trying to help these people. \nCarnegie can't help himself - once again he is in his natural element, spinning the argument his way, pitching. Selling. \nCARNEGIE In the outland the sightless are preyed upon like sick animals. Here at least they're protected. They do the essential work others don't want. And in return they eat, they drink, they survive. Last year, a couple of them even got married - performed the ceremony myself. (BEAT) You see, I'm not exploiting these people - I'm saving them! Any one of them is free to leave whenever they wish. But here they stay. And they thank me every single day for their salvation! \nAn impressive, impassioned performance. He sounds just like an old-school TV evangelist. But Eli is unmoved. \nELI It's none of my business what you do here. Like you said, it's your town. I just want to be on my way. \nCARNEGIE What's your name, walker? \nEli doesn't respond. Just stands there. \nCARNEGIE All right, I guess we just call you Walker. Don't see too many folks your age these days. You lived in the world before? You can read? \nELI I read every day. \nCARNEGIE That's good. Good man. We educated folk, we need to stick together, if we're ever going to rebuild this world. People like you and me, we're the future. \nELI What do you want with me? \nCARNEGIE Straight to the point. I like that. Fact is, you could be in a lot of trouble. This is a peaceful town. You walk in here, armed, and the next thing a dozen of my good citizens are dead. I've hanged men for less. I could hang you. (BEAT) Or, you could come work for me. \nELI What? \nCARNEGIE I never once saw anyone handle themselves the way you did down there in that bar. I don't know where you learned it, but I sure as hell could use it. \nELI I'm not interested. \nCARNEGIE People who work for me can live better than any walker ever dreamed. Real beds, clean water, hot food. Women, even. You could do a lot worse, my friend. \nELI I'm not your friend. And I'm not staying. I got someplace I need to be. Out west. \nCARNEGIE West? There is nothing west. It's all gone, a long time ago. \nELI I've been told different. \nCARNEGIE By who? \nEli doesn't reply. Carnegie smiles, dials up the charm. \nCARNEGIE All right, look. I'm going to make you an offer of goodwill. Stay the night, think it over. Try a little local hospitality. We'll talk again in the morning. If you're still not interested, you're free to go. No hard feelings. \nELI Thank you for your offer. But I'd prefer to just leave right now. So you can either let me out of here, or I can kill my way out. \nThe gunmen bristle, exchange nervous looks. Carnegie appears unfazed. He smiles. BEAT. He looks to the gunman at the door. \nCARNEGIE Let him go. \nThe gunman opens the door. Eli turns and exits. \n", "test2_true": "The engineer stands behind the counter, looking worried. His heart sinks when he sees Eli enter. \nENGINEER Oh, shit... \nELI How's my battery? \nENGINEER It's, uh... it's gonna take a little longer than I thought. \nELI How much longer? \nENGINEER It's gotta charge overnight. You, uh, you can always stay here in town, pick it up in the morning. \nEli leans in a little closer. He smells a rat. \nELI You remember what I said would happen if I came back here and you didn't have my battery? \nENGINEER It's right here! It's just gonna take a while longer. I swear. \nEli looks at the engineer. Hard to be certain, but he's pretty sure he's lying. Somebody got to him. \nINT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX \nA VIOLENT COMMOTION is heard from down the hall. Suddenly one of Carnegie's henchmen comes flying into view as he is THROWN HARD INTO A WALL and slumps to the floor, unconscious. \nEli storms into the box, pissed. MORE GUARDS rush in behind him. Carnegie, seated behind his desk, waves the guards off as he stands to greet Eli, smiling ingratiatingly as ever. \nCARNEGIE I knew you'd reconsider. \nELI Yeah? How'd you know that? \nCARNEGIE None of the walkers I've seen come here from the outland were ever what you'd call smart. I mean all those years out there alone on the road, some with their brains half- fried from eating each other - it's understandable why you people aren't the brightest bulbs in the box. But I never met one so dumb that he'd turn down a meal and a bed if it was offered. \nELI So you didn't send someone across the street to the engineer? \nCARNEGIE Engineer? I don't know what you're talking about. If there's something wrong, maybe I can help. \nCarnegie is a practiced liar. Much more difficult to read. \nCARNEGIE This is Redridge. He's kind of my right-hand man around here. \nRedridge - one of the two men who chased Eli into the room - steps forward. He regards Eli with a distrustful eye. \nCARNEGIE He'll show you to your room. \nINT. PALLADIUM - GUEST BEDROOM - DUSK \nRedridge opens the door and ushers Eli inside. \nIt's another of the dressing rooms converted into a bedroom, less well-appointed than Carnegie's own. A threadbare rug. Bed with relatively clean sheets. A sink for washing. \nREDRIDGE Enjoy your stay. There'll be someone outside your room all night. If you need anything. \nRedridge smirks and closes the door, leaving Eli alone. Eli paces across the room. Finally sits down on the creaky old bed. Trying to figure out how he managed to get stuck here. \nHe unshoulders his pack, sets it down. Lies down on the bed. It's been a while since he felt a real bed on his back. \nA KNOCK at the door. Eli gets quickly to his feet. \nELI Hello? \nThe door opens and CLAUDIA enters. Carrying a metal tub of water in both hands and, atop that, a dinner tray. \nCLAUDIA I have this for you. Water for washing and some food. \nEli just stands there. Totally unfamiliar with this kind of situation, it's been too long. She smiles, embarrassed. \nCLAUDIA Well... are you going to take it? \nELI Oh. Thank you. \nHe takes the stuff from her, sets it on the table. \nCLAUDIA You're very welcome. \nWe get the impression that Claudia is as unfamiliar with this kind of polite interaction as Eli. But she likes it. \nCLAUDIA It'll be dark soon. \nShe strikes a match and lights the oil lamp on the table. The room is lit by its flickering glow. \nCLAUDIA Can I get you anything else? \nELI No, thank you. \nCLAUDIA Well. Have a good night. \n", "test3_input": "Eli casts off the camouflage net and walks toward the dead prairie dog. Solara just stands there, appalled. \nSOLARA You killed it! That cute little thing! \nEli picks up the dead animal by the scruff. \nELI It's good eating, is what it is. \nHe yanks out the bloody arrow. Solara looks away. \nWhen she turns back, Eli is standing right there, holding the dead animal in front of her face. She YELPS in surprise and staggers backward, falling on her butt. \nSOLARA That's not funny. \nELI If you're going to be on the road, you can't be picky about what you eat. You eat what's there to eat. \nSOLARA I'm not eating that. \nELI (SHRUGS) More for me. \nEXT. WASTELAND CAVE - DUSK \nEli and Solara sit in the mouth of a desert cave, around a flickering campfire. The prairie dog roasts on a spit. \nEli digs his knife into the carcass, the blade comes out clean. It's done. He clasps his hands together and gazes down penitently at the ground. \nELI Father, we thank you for your generosity in providing us with this meal. Bless this food to our use and us to thy service, and keep us ever mindful of the needs of others. Amen. \nEli carves off a piece of meat. Juicy and succulent. He bites into it, teasing Solara by making a show of how good it tastes. He feeds a piece to the rat perched on his shoulder. \nSolara tries to appear uninterested, but she's starved. \nSOLARA What does that taste like? \nHe takes another bite, thinks on this as he chews. \nELI Tastes like chicken. \nShe tries to fight the temptation to try it... but she can't. She reaches out and tears off a piece. Sniffs at it, takes a small bite... then quickly wolfs down the rest. Eli smiles. \nAs she eats, she gestures toward Eli's Saint Christopher. \nSOLARA What is that? \nEli reaches up and touches his hand to it. \nELI It's a Saint Christopher medal. \nSOLARA Who's Saint Christopher? Is he a character from your book? \nEli smiles and shakes his head. \nELI Christopher was a man who lived a long time ago. He wanted to be a good man, he wanted to help people. So he would stand by a river that had no bridge and carry people across. He was a big strong man and there was no one he couldn't carry. \nSolara listens, rapt. Eli is a good storyteller. \nELI Then one day a young child came to the river and asked to be carried across. Christopher tried to carry him but he was too heavy. He was just a small boy but he was heavier than any man he had ever carried. The boy explained that he was the son of God, and that he was so heavy because he bore all the sins of the world. After that, Christopher was able to carry him across and when they got to the other side the boy baptized him in the river. And that's how he became a saint. Later on, he was known as the patron saint of travelers. \nSOLARA What is a saint, anyway? \nELI It's someone who spent their life doing good things for others. Enough that God himself took a special interest in them. \nSolara looks at Eli tenderly, with admiration. \nSOLARA Someone like you. \nEli looks away, down at the ground. He appears sad. \nELI No. Not like me. Saints ain't killers. And I done too much of that. Spilled too much blood. \nBEAT. No words, just the flickering firelight. \nSOLARA Will you read me some more from the book? \nELI It's late. You should get some sleep. Maybe tomorrow. \nLATER - NIGHT \nThe fire down to its last embers. Eli sleeps next to his pack, half-hidden in the looming shadows of the cave. His hat and goggles hung up for the night on the hilt of his sword. \nSolara sleeps nearby... then opens her eyes. Not asleep after all. She looks over at Eli - his face hidden in shadow and so impossible to tell if he's asleep or awake. \nSOLARA Eli? \nNo response. Quietly, she moves forward, kneeling by his side. She opens his coat and checks the pockets. Empty. \nShe goes deeper, peeling back the layers of clothing, stealthily frisking him. She finds something on his lapel, hidden under several layers, that causes her to stop. \n", "test3_true": "WELCOME TO WAL-MART MY NAME IS \"ELI\" HOW MAY I HELP YOU? \nShe stares at it for a moment, not knowing what to make of it. Then moves on, continuing to pat him down. \nWhatever she's looking for is not here. She turns her attention to the backpack. Slowly, carefully, opens it up. \nThere it is. THE BIBLE, wrapped carefully in its neat little package of cloth and twine. She reaches in for it. \nSuddenly, ELI'S HAND SHOOTS OUT AND GRABS HER BY THE WRIST. She cries out, startled. Eli sits up, his face just a dark shape in the shadows. For the first time he appears a little scary to Solara. \nELI What are you doing? \nSOLARA You scared me! I thought you were asleep. \nELI On the road you sleep with one eye open. I asked you what you were doing. \nSOLARA I just wanted to see the book. \nELI You want to see the book, you ask me. Nobody touches it but me. Ever. Until it gets where it's going. Do you understand? \nHe's very forceful. She nods, a little afraid of him. \nELI Tell me you understand! \nHe grips her wrist tighter. \nSOLARA Okay! I understand! Ow! \nEli releases her wrist. Takes the pack from her and closes it up. Pulls it closer to him and lies back down. \nELI It's no use to you anyway. You don't know how to read it. \nSOLARA Well... now we have the time, maybe you can teach me. \nELI Maybe. Get some sleep. \nShe lies back down beside him, but doesn't close her eyes. She just lies there, watching him. \nEXT. WASTELAND - DAWN \nThe sun rises out of the east. And out of the sun comes the FLEET OF ARMORED VEHICLES. Racing side-by-side down the road. \nThe lead vehicle comes to a halt. A door opens and Redridge gets out. MORE ARMED MEN emerge from the other vehicles and follow him as he marches into the wasteland by the roadside. \nThe DEAD BRIGANDS are splayed out in the dirt where Eli slew them. A FLOCK OF BUZZARDS is picking their bones clean. \nREDRIDGE He's been here. \nRedridge looks at the footprints in the dirt headed from the bodies and back onto the road. Two sets of tracks. \nREDRIDGE The girl's with him. \nHe moves back to the cars. \nREDRIDGE Move out! \nThe other men hold for a moment, still looking at the half- eaten bodies in the dirt. Redridge turns back. \nREDRIDGE I said move out! \nCARNEGIE GUNMAN I heard this guy's protected somehow, some... power from up above. That there ain't nothing on this earth can touch him. \nREDRIDGE He's just a man. You put a bullet in him, he'll go down like any other. I don't want to hear no more of this superstitious horseshit! \nHesitantly, they make their way back to the vehicles. The cars gun their engines and move on down the road, past the abandoned Chevron station. Dust pluming in their wake. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nEli and Solara walk together, passing by a few burned-out buildings. It appears we might be headed toward a town. \nSolara looks up at the sweltering sun. Then around at her surroundings. Nothing but devastation and decay. \nSOLARA You say you've been walking for twenty-five years. Have you ever considered that you might be lost? \nELI No. \nSOLARA But how can you know? How can you know this is the right way? \nELI I told you. My path has been laid out before me. \nSOLARA Yeah, but laid out by who? \nELI By Almighty God. \nSOLARA Well if this God guy's so mighty, how come it's taking you so long to get where you're going? Doesn't he know the way? \n"}

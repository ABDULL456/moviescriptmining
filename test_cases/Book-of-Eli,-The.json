{"test1_input": "She slides off the bed, approaches him. Begins to work the buttons of his shirt. \nSOLARA They're all that kind of man. He moves her hand away. Gently pushes her back a step. \nELI I'm not. \nShe is stunned. No man has ever turned her down before. And then she seems a little insulted. \nSOLARA They told me you were crazy. Maybe they were right. \nEli opens the door for her. \nELI I'm sorry. Good night. \nSuddenly all her other emotions give way to fear. She moves to the door and slams it shut again. Looks Eli in the eye. \nSOLARA Please don't make me leave. I have to stay the night. If I don't... \nELI If you don't, what? \nSOLARA He'll hurt my mom. \nELI Who will? Carnegie? \nShe nods, fighting back a tear. This angers Eli. \nELI Maybe he and I oughta have words. \nHe goes for the door handle, but she stops him. \nSOLARA No! Please, don't! \nELI He's hurting you. He's hurting your mother. He's- \nSOLARA He's my dad. \nBEAT. Eli moves his hand away from the door. \nSOLARA Look, if you want to help me, just let me stay here tonight. We don't have to do anything. I'll sleep on the floor. Tomorrow you can tell my dad that we had a good time. I'll be no trouble, I swear. \nShe looks up at Eli imploringly. Transformed. No longer the teenage sex kitten. Now she's just a frightened little girl. \nELI You want to have a conversation? \nShe smiles, wiping the tear from her cheek. \nLATER \nEli and Solara sit together on the bed. A silent BEAT. At first, it appears as though they have nothing to say. \nELI You know, you don't have to be afraid of me. What happened down there in the bar... \nSOLARA I'm not afraid of you. I know you didn't start that trouble. When I first saw you, I knew you weren't the type to go looking for it. \nELI How'd you know that? \nSOLARA My mom says I'm a good judge of character. She says I can read people. That I know a good man when I see one. \nShe smiles. Eli is surprised to find himself smiling back. \nSOLARA So... you're pretty old, right? \nEli smiles, amused by the bluntness of the question. \nSOLARA I'm sorry. I just mean, I haven't seen too many people your age. How old are you exactly? \nELI You know, I don't rightly remember. \nSOLARA But you're old enough. I mean, you remember what it was like? In the world before? \nEli nods. \nSOLARA What was it like? \nEli thinks about this. Dredging through old, old memories. \nELI Better than this. (BEAT) People lived longer back then. Longer than me. Some were more than a hundred years old. \nSolara smiles like she's having her leg pulled. \nSOLARA Come on. \nELI I swear, it's true. Nowadays it's not the same. If you're sick or you're weak or you're old you won't last long out on the road. \nSOLARA So how come you have? \nBEAT. Eli thinks. Should he or shouldn't he? \n", "test1_true": "SOLARA Wait. You can read? \nEli pulls the book from his shirt. Solara's eyes widen. \nSOLARA And you have a book? ELI Not just any book. \nFor the first time we see that it's a KING JAMES BIBLE. An embossed GOLD CROSS on its old leather cover. \nEli opens it up, scans the page with his finger until he finds the passage he's looking for. \nELI The Lord is my shepherd. I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures. He leads me beside still waters. He restores my soul. He leads me in the paths of righteousness. \nON SOLARA as she listens to Eli read. Transfixed. \nELI Though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For you are with me. Your rod and your staff, they comfort me. You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies. You anoint my head with oil. My cup runs over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me, all the days of my life. And I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. \nSOLARA That's beautiful. Did you write that? \nELI (SMILES) No. \nSOLARA What book is it from? Is it poetry? \nELI I guess you could think of it that way. It's from the Holy Bible. \nSOLARA I never heard of it. What's it about? \nBEAT as Eli thinks. How on earth to answer that? \nELI It's about love, and forgiveness, and life and death, and mercy, and revenge, and the beginning and the end of the world. I guess it's about a little bit of everything. \nSOLARA Can I see? \nShe reaches out for the book but he snatches it away. \nSOLARA What? I'm not going to do anything. \nELI I'm sorry. I'm charged to protect this book. I can't trust it with anyone. Not even for a while. \nSOLARA What's so special about that book? \nBEAT. Eli runs his fingers across the embossed gold cross on the beat-up leather cover. \nELI It's the last one. There are no other books like this. All the others are gone - destroyed by the war or in the burnings that came after. This is the only one that survived until now. The last one anywhere. \nSOLARA How can you know that? \nELI I just know. (BEAT) For a long while after it happened, I just wandered on the road like most everybody else. There were still a lot of people around back then, in the beginning. I didn't really know what I should do or where I was going. I was just moving from place to place, trying to stay alive. And then one day I heard this voice. I don't know how to explain it, it's like it was coming from inside me. But I could hear it, clear as day. Clear as I can hear you talking to me now. \nSOLARA What did it say? \nELI It led me to this place, I don't really know where. And I found this book buried deep under some rubble. No way no-one was ever going to find it if they didn't know exactly where to look. \nSOLARA But you knew because the voice told you? \nELI That's right. And that voice told me to carry the book west. (MORE) \nELI (cont'd) It told me that a path would be laid out before me, that I'd be led to a place where this book would be safe. It told me I'd be protected against anyone or anything that tried to stand in my way. If only I would have faith. (BEAT) That was twenty-five years ago. And I've been walking ever since. \nSOLARA (SKEPTICAL) Because a voice you heard in your head told you to. \nELI I'm not crazy. I didn't imagine it. I know what I heard. \nSOLARA So who was it? The voice? \nBEAT as Eli considers his answer. \nELI A very important, very powerful man. \nSOLARA More powerful than my dad? \nELI (SMILES) I should say so, yes. \nBEAT. The two of them sit in silence for a moment. \nSOLARA Would you teach me to read? \nELI What? \nSOLARA I never learned. No-one around here knows how. Only my dad, and he won't teach me. I think he likes being the only one who can read. I think it makes him feel powerful. \nELI I think you're probably right. \nSOLARA So would you teach me? \nELI I'm sorry. I'm leaving tomorrow. And I won't be back this way, ever. \n", "test1_id": 2211, "test2_input": "BEAT. Eli stops and turns back to face her. \nELI It's dangerous in the outland. I wouldn't want you to get hurt. \nSOLARA I'll be safe so long as I'm with you. I know it. \nEli sighs. He's not getting through to her. So now comes the harsh truth of it: \nELI You don't want this life. I gotta do what I gotta do. Don't have no choice in it. But you do. And I can't let you choose this. You don't want to be like me. You don't want to spend your life alone. \nSolara steps closer, her eyes pleading. \nSOLARA If I came with you, I wouldn't be alone. And neither would you. \nA long BEAT as Eli considers this. For a moment it appears as though Solara might have won him over. But then: \nELI I'm sorry. Look, maybe it's best you just go on back to town. \nHe turns and walks off, leaving her in the road. She stands there, furious, screaming at his back as he walks away. \nSOLARA Fine! I'll do just that! I had a life there! A family! I didn't ask you to save me! I didn't ask you for anything! \nHe doesn't turn or acknowledge her at all. Just keeps walking off into the horizon. Getting smaller all the time. \nSolara stands there in the road, weeping. All alone. \nSOLARA (SOFTLY) Fine. \nShe turns and walks back in the direction she came. \nEXT. DESERT TOWN - BARNYARD - DAY \nA small, penned-in area to the rear of the Palladium containing an eclectic bunch of farmyard animals. Goats, sheep, geese, pigs. Mostly mangy, sad-looking specimens. \nCarnegie stands in the yard, tossing handfuls of animal feed from a nearby sack onto the ground. He watches with satisfaction as the animals gather at his feet to feed. \nClaudia emerges from the theater with an ice-pack. \nCARNEGIE Thank you, darling. \nCarnegie applies it to his jaw, red and swollen from Eli's pistol-whip. Redridge appears nearby, his arm in a sling. \nREDRIDGE He killed four of my men and walked out of town without a scratch. They shot off a hundred rounds at him and he didn't get hit once. I never even heard of anything like that. \nCarnegie doesn't appear to be listening. He is lost in a world of his own as he tends to the farm animals. \nCARNEGIE You know, I always thought of myself as a shepherd. Bringing together the wayward and the lost. Tending to my flock. But all the things I want to do, I can't do them on my own. The one thing I've needed is the one thing that's always been missing. Then one day it walks right into town - so close I can almost touch it - and then walks right on out again. \nCarnegie finally looks up from his animals, at Redridge. \nCARNEGIE I want you to put a crew together and go out after him. \nREDRIDGE He's not going to work for you. I think he's made that plain. \nCARNEGIE I'm not interested in him any more. I only want the book he's carrying. \nREDRIDGE If I'm gonna risk my ass hunting down this maniac in the outland, I need to know it's gonna be worth it. I need to know what's so special about this goddamn book. \nBEAT as Carnegie considers this. \nCARNEGIE You have no idea. You're too young, you don't remember the world before. But I do. I remember. \nHe turns back to his animals, summoning up old memories. \nCARNEGIE When I was a kid my parents used to read that book every goddamn day. My mother, she'd read it along with this smooth-talking preacher on the TV screen. They used to be able to beam these guys right into your house, into every house in the world, through the air. Like magic. (BEAT) She worked two jobs and she sent every spare penny she had to that fucking guy on the TV. My old man, he'd read that book, then he'd get liquored up and kick my ass, tell me all about the power and the glory and how I was going to burn forever in hell for the sins I was born with. He made sure he beat it into me good. \nHe snaps out of his reverie and looks at Redridge. \nCARNEGIE Don't you see? It's not just any book. (MORE) \nCARNEGIE (cont'd) It has the power to motivate people. It can give them hope, it can terrify them. It can shape them. Control them. (BEAT) Do you remember how I built this town? It wasn't done with force, and it wasn't done just with water. It was done with the power of words. I created this place out of nothing, because people believed in a promise that I sold to them. Those guys on the TV, they were richer than you could ever dream, and it was all built the same way. With words. With promises. And with that book. (BEAT) That book is a weapon. Aimed right at the hearts and minds of the weak and the desperate. Just imagine what I could do with it. \nREDRIDGE Boss... we're running out of water and the people are running out of patience. You're trying to tell me that a book is going to keep them in line? \nCARNEGIE Oh, it'll do much more than that. The water in this town may run dry, but faith - that springs eternal! And that faith will help turn this town into a city. And this city into a nation. It will help me build a new world. In my image. People will come from far and wide to hear what's inside of it. They'll follow me anywhere just to get a taste of it. And they'll do whatever I tell them. \nAs usual, Carnegie's slick rhetoric has worked - Redridge has totally bought into it. Claudia, however, looks appalled. \nREDRIDGE And what if this book don't work? What if it don't say what you want it to say? \nCARNEGIE Oh, it'll say what I want, I can promise you that. Because I'm going to rewrite it. I'll keep the parts that work for me and make the rest whatever I need it to be. (BEAT) A new bible, for a new world. \nHe reaches out and takes Claudia by the hand. \nCARNEGIE What do you think, darling? A whole new world, to do with as we will. Won't that be grand? \nShe smiles halfheartedly, but it's clear she is mortified. \n", "test2_true": "CARNEGIE Find that book. \nREDRIDGE He has half a day on us already. \nCARNEGIE So use the motor pool. \nREDRIDGE There ain't much gas in reserve. \nCARNEGIE Whatever there is, use it. \nRedridge nods and goes to leave. \nCLAUDIA What about Solara? \nBEAT. In all this excitement about the book, she had been completely forgotten about. \nCLAUDIA She's still out there. With him. \nCARNEGIE Right. Right. Of course. Bring her back, too, if you can. But- \nREDRIDGE The book. I know. \nRedridge turns and leaves. Claudia scowls at Carnegie, but he doesn't even notice, just goes back to feeding his animals. \nEXT. DESOLATE ROAD - DAY \nSolara wanders the road. She's tired. The sun beats down mercilessly. Nothing but desolation and wasteland all around. \nShe comes to a FORK IN THE ROAD. Stops at the junction, unsure. Was this here before? She doesn't remember. \nThere are no signs. Both paths look the same. Which one is which? She turns and looks back, looks around. She's lost. \nSOLARA Shit. Shit. \nShe alternates her finger between the two paths. Eeny-meeny- miney-moe. Picks a path and follows it, headed down the road. \nEXT. ROAD - DAY \nEli walks on. Slow and steady. His gaze, as ever, fixed firmly on the horizon. Takes a swig from his canteen. \nSuddenly, he STOPS and stands stock still in the center of the road. Impossible to know what he's thinking. \nHe stands there for a long time. \nEXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - DAY \nSolara comes upon an abandoned CHEVRON STATION. She doesn't remember passing this. Looks back up and down the road. \nSOLARA Where the hell am I? \nThere's a RUSTED CAR parked at one of the pumps. Like every other car we've seen, stripped of its tires and engine. \nShe walks around to the driver's side. A PETRIFIED FEMALE BODY lies on the ground, half-in, half-out of the car. \nSolara claps her hand to her mouth and recoils, horrified. \nIn the dead woman's hand is a dusty bottle of MINERAL WATER. Solara hesitates. Not wanting to get closer. But so thirsty. \nShe braces herself, grimacing, and tries to take the bottle, but the dead woman's hand is closed tight around it. She pulls harder and wrenches it free. In the process she falls on her butt and flips the corpse over onto its back. \nIn the other woman's arm, she has a SKELETAL BABY cradled to her bosom. It seems to be staring right at Solara. \nSolara SCREAMS and frantically shuffles backward away from it. Gets to her feet and runs across the forecourt. \nShe stops by the station shop and rests against the wall, hyperventilating, heart pounding. Trying to get it together. \nShe inspects the water in the bottle. It looks clean. Unscrews the cap with shaking hands and takes a sip. \nShe SPITS IT BACK OUT, coughing. It's rank. Undrinkable. \nINT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - FOOD COURT - DAY \nSolara enters. Gloomy inside. Comprehensively looted. Empty shelves coated in thick sheets of dust. \nShe moves further in, searching for something, anything. But the place has been gutted. There's nothing. She checks the wall of dead refrigerators. Shattered glass, all empty. \nShe's never known desolation and emptiness like this. It's beginning to scare her. She wheels around in a panic. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Hello? \nDistant, calling from outside. Solara hears it and freezes. \nFEMALE VOICE (O.S.) Hello? Can anyone help me? \nEXT. WASTELAND GAS STATION - CONTINUOUS \n", "test2_id": 2212, "test3_input": "Eli uses his sheathed sword as a walking stick, poking around ahead of him for loose rubble underfoot. He steps carefully. \nELI Watch your footing. Step where I step. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FINANCIAL DISTRICT - DAY \nMore buildings are still standing here, but they're nothing more than great dead monoliths. Solara looks up at the blasted skyscrapers - she's never seen anything like it. \nThe buildings loom over her like giant tombstones. It scares her - like walking through the graveyard of a dead world. \nSOLARA This... this is the world before? \nELI What's left of it. \nThey keep walking, passing the TOPPLED TRANSAMERICA PYRAMID. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO - FISHERMAN'S WHARF - DAY \nOnce a bustling oceanside tourist spot, now a ghost town. \nEli and Solara walk along the litter-strewn street, passing the old RIPLEY'S BELIEVE-IT-OR-NOT and WAX MUSEUMS. The celebrity mannequins are still in fair condition, but slumped at their feet are CHARRED HUMAN SKELETONS. \nEli is struggling now. He looks pale from the blood loss. His breathing labored. Solara takes him by the arm to help him. \nEXT. SAN FRANCISCO - PIER 39 - DAY \nA dead, ruined place, like everywhere else. We hear the sound of SEAGULLS nearby - the only sign of life at all. \nEli and Solara walk along the pier, until they reach its end. The original end has long since collapsed into the sea, but a RICKETY HAND-MADE ROPE BRIDGE has been affixed to the pier's sheared-off edge. \nEli and Solara stand at the pier's end, looking out to sea. \nELI Do you see that? \nSOLARA I see it. Is that it? \nELI That's it. \nReveal now that the rope-bridge leads out across the bay to: \nALCATRAZ ISLAND \nLooking much the same as it always has, old and dilapidated. The coastal fog shrouding it gives it an ethereal look. It feels almost like a mythic place - the \"promised land\" Eli has sought for so many years. \nA tattered STARS AND STRIPES still flutters in the breeze atop the prison lighthouse. \nEXT. BAY ROPE BRIDGE - DAY \nEli and Solara make their way carefully across the bridge. It feels highly unstable and sags low over the bay, the waters below close enough to lap around their ankles. \nEXT. ALCATRAZ ISLAND - DAY \nEli and Solara arrive at the prison gates. Securely locked. As they inspect it for a possible way to enter: \nVOICE (O.S.) Who goes there? \nThey look up. A GUARD in paramilitary fatigues is stationed in one of the perimeter towers. Training a rifle on them. \nALCATRAZ GUARD Identify yourselves! \nIn the opposite tower ANOTHER GUARD has his rifle trained on them too. Eli looks up, raises his hands. \nELI My name is Elijah Stone. I have a message for your boss. I need you to tell him that I have a King James Bible in my possession. \nBEAT. \nALCATRAZ GUARD Remain where you are! Do not attempt to move or you will be fired upon! \nKeeping the gun trained on them, the tower guard uses his free hand to talk into a WALKIE-TALKIE RADIO. We don't hear the conversation. All Eli and Solara can do is wait. \nThe guard puts away his radio and shouts back down: \nALCATRAZ GUARD Be prepared to surrender any weapons at the gate! \nBEAT. And then the massive front gates SLOWLY OPEN ON MECHANICAL RUNNERS with the low groan of rusted iron. \nEli and Solara look at each other, then step gingerly inside. \nINT. ALCATRAZ - MAIN GATES - CONTINUOUS \nAs soon as they step inside they are SURROUNDED BY DOZENS OF HEAVILY-ARMED SOLDIERS. Not U.S. military, more like a semi- official militia. But every bit as deadly. \nEli and Solara raise their hands. A pair of SOLDIERS take Eli's pack and sword, pat them both down for other weapons. \nSOLDIER They're clean. \nThe soldiers before them part - to reveal a THIN, BALDING MAN wearing spectacles. He wears Kevlar body armor over his tweed jacket and tie. Professorial, academic. \n", "test3_true": "THIN MAN Welcome, both of you. I'm Professor Lombardi. I'm the curator here. \nELI Elijah Stone. \nSOLARA Solara. \nLOMBARDI Solara. What a delightful name. Is that by any chance Shakespearean? \nSOLARA I, uh, I think it's Japanese. \nLOMBARDI Wonderful. \nHe turns back to Eli. \nLOMBARDI Is it true what they tell me? You have a King James Version? \nELI Been carrying it with me for twenty- five years. \nSolara looks at Eli, puzzled. Lombardi finds it hard to contain his excitement. \nLOMBARDI My goodness. I can't tell you how exciting this is. Well, come, come! (MORE) \nLOMBARDI (cont'd) I'll give you the nickel tour and then we can all sit down and take a look at it. \nHe leads them across the courtyard into the prison buildings. \nEXT. DESERT TOWN - MAIN STREET - DAY \nRedridge's remaining vehicles drive back into town and come to a halt outside the theater. Redridge emerges from his car, carrying the bible. Walks up to the Palladium and enters. \nINT. ALCATRAZ - CELL BLOCK - DAY \nWhat was once a cell block is now an IMMENSE LIBRARY. Stacked floor to ceiling with books. Lombardi shows Eli and Solara around. Behind them, a pair of ARMED GUARDS follow closely. \nLOMBARDI Yes, we've been doing this for some time now. Collected over thirty thousand volumes from generous donors all across the nation. We even have a printing press that we hope to have operational soon. \nSolara is stunned as she surveys the endless stacks of books. She's never seen anything like it. \nSOLARA You turned the whole prison into a library? \nLOMBARDI Well, not exactly. We're more like a storage facility. We're holding these books here in trust, if you like. When society gets back on its feet and no longer needs us to preserve these volumes, they'll be here waiting. (BEAT) I must ask you, how did you hear about us? We've been doing everything we can to get the word out, but we always like to know where our benefactors come from. \nELI I was sent here by God. \nLombardi raises a quizzical eyebrow. \nLOMBARDI Is that right? Well, it's good to know we're getting such high- profile referrals these days. (BEAT) I must say, I am so excited that we finally have a King James. You know, we have a Talmud here, we have two Korans, we even have that Scientology book. But never a Christian bible, until now. I honestly believed it was the one book I'd never see again, after what happened... \nBEAT. Lombardi appears sad for a moment. \nLOMBARDI May I ask what condition it's in? \nELI It's a little beat-up. But it'll do the job. \nLOMBARDI Well, then. What say we take a look at it? \nLombardi looks at Eli with anticipation. So does Solara, interested to know where this is going to go next. \nEli winces in pain, puts his hand to his side. \nELI Is there someplace we could sit? \nLOMBARDI Of course. Right this way. \nINT. PALLADIUM AUDITORIUM - CARNEGIE'S BOX \nRedridge appears. Carnegie looks at him eagerly. \nCARNEGIE Did you get it? \nRedridge holds the bible up proudly. Carnegie beams. \nCARNEGIE Show me. \nRedridge hands it over. Carnegie sits back in his chair, running his hand lovingly over the battered leather cover. \nCARNEGIE The new world begins here... \nHe opens the book and looks inside. \nBEAT. And then he looks up at Redridge, confused. \nCARNEGIE What the fuck is this? \nINT. ALCATRAZ - CAFETERIA - DAY \n", "test3_id": 2213}

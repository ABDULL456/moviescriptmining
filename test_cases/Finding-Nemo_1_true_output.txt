DORY Why? What's wrong? 
MARLIN We're in a whale! Don't you get it!? 
DORY A whale? 
MARLIN A whale! 'Cause you had to ask for help! And now we're stuck here! 
DORY Wow. A whale. You know I speak whale. 
MARLIN No, you're insane! You can't speak whale! I have to get out! I have to find my son! I have to tell him how old sea turtles are! [sobs]

DORY There, there. It's all right. It'll be okay. 
MARLIN No. No, it won't. 
DORY Sure it will, you'll see. 
MARLIN No. I promised him I'd never let anything happen to him. 
DORY Huh. That's a funny thing to promise. 
MARLIN What? 
DORY Well, you can't never let anything happen to him. Then nothing would ever happen to him. Not much fun for little Harpo. 
DORY Hmm..

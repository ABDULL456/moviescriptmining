MUNITIA (to Amazonia) Change gear ratio from 2.2 to 2.8! 
Amazonia pushes a sick dignitary away from the rail so she can get a sight line to the tank with her lantern semaphore. She begins flashing the new gear ratio.

AMAZONIA A bucket for the minister, please! 
Now in the b.g., we hear the GATLINGS OPEN UP. Lippenreider is reading the lips of the tank's victims. 
LIPPENREIDER Scream. Scream. My head. I'm dying. Scream. Moan. Scream. 
McGRATH Loveless, I demand you give the order to stop this slaughter now! 
LOVELESS (ignores him) ... We're going to need more loading drills! I'm hearing too much time between screams. 
As Munitia scribbles dutifully, McGrath shoves her aside. He pulls his pistol. 
McGRATH For the last time, give them the order to desist! 
Loveless, his back to him, is seemingly unconcerned at having a gun barrel pressed against his skull. 
LOVELESS General, I understand your distress. But believe me, those men are not dying senselessly. It is for a far greater cause than you can imagine. 
As Loveless's right index finger finds a black button on the arm of his wheelchair... 
CLOSE ANGLE - LOVELESS'S WHEELCHAIR ARM 
The steel tubes that comprise the armrests are actually shotgun barrels facing fore and aft. McGrath's finger tightens on the trigger. 
WIDER 
McGRATH Go straight to hell, sir!

WILD WILD WEST - Rev. 4/9/99                                54.

LOVELESS After you... sir. 
BOOOM!!! McGrath has a very startled expression as he looks down at the aftereffects of DOUBLE-OUGHT BUCKSHOT. As he crumples to the deck, Loveless sniffs. 
LOVELESS Bloodbath McGrath indeed. 
The dignitary's DOG starts BARKING, jumps to the deck. It sits next to the fallen General's gramophone ear and cocks his head. With the RCA logo invented we MOVE BACK TO... 
ANGLE ON LOVELESS 
He sighs at his pale guests. They don't seem to appreciate the efficiency of his slaughter. 
LOVELESS Well, that concludes the festivities. Ladies, feed him to the crabs. 
Munitia and Amazonia unceremoniously dump McGrath's BODY overboard. SPLOOSH... Loveless addresses the dignitaries... 
LOVELESS But, my friends, that tank is just a little ol' toy compared to what this country's greatest scientists are cooking up for me next. So if I've piqued your interest, bring 1000 kilograms of your country's gold to Spider Canyon four days from now. (starts to roll off boat) Now if you'll excuse me, I've got a tank to catch. 
CUT TO: 
73   EXT. TRAIN SIDING (NEAR MALHEUREUX POINT) - NIGHT                 73 
A black waits ominously on the tracks. It's less a traditional train car than a riveted, armored, turreted fortress on wheels. Also, it currently lacks an engine. 
Loveless, over his shoulder to the foreign contingent...

73   CONTINUED:                                                      73 
LOVELESS My destination is both the future... and the past! Forget Paul Revere, this will be the most revolutionary ride in the history of America!! 
He looks dotingly at the TANK, which CLATTERS up from the battlefield on its treads... then drives onto the tracks. Wheels drop down out of the chassis, the treads retract up, and the TANK BACKS INTO the rest of the TRAIN. CLANK. It's a neat modular fit. Black death on rails. 
The foreigners watch with awe as... 
ANGLE - LOVELESS 
wheels up onto the tank/train. He drops the expansiveness, fixes them with a viper's eye. 
LOVELESS If you don't want to miss the ride, have the last payment of 1000 kilograms of your country's gold in my hands no later than Friday. That's when I make our little proposal to President Grant. One I'm ever so confident he's gonna accept. (now a jaunty wave of his hat) Au revoir, adios, and ta-ta! 
74   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - BATTLEFIELD - STRAIGHT-DOWN             74 ANGLE - NIGHT 
It's quiet.    The dead men are all in the #9 or #10 ring. 
Now a rider ENTERS FRAME... 
75   EXT. MALHEUREUX POINT - BATTLEFIELD - NIGHT                     75 
West slowly dismounts, transfixed by the slaughter on the pre-fab battlefield. There's something hauntingly familiar about all this for him -- the mangled bodies, the tread marks... But we'll find out about that later. 
West draws his weapon and begins walking through the victims. The pace of his search quickens when he isn't finding what he's looking for -- General McGrath.

NEW ANGLE - GORDON AND RITA 
have arrived in the one-horse carriage. Gordon is trying to recreate the crime scene. Rita trails behind him, his coat thrown over her shoulders, trying not to gag as she passes the mangled corpses.

BRYAN (ON TV) If on Monday Khatami refuses the I.A.E.A. inspectors, look for crude prices to spike yet again. Push into the television -- 
CUT TO: 
66 INT. MINI-STUDIO - DAY 66 
Bryan under the lights, listening. on closer inspection he looks tired and his tie is loosened. 
BRYAN It's not like it's any secret Iran will refuse the snap inspections. (after a pause) okay. Thank you, Rebecca. Bryan nods and the lights go off on Bryan. He stares -- 
BOSS (O.S.) Go home. 
BRYAN It was a stupid question, Henry. 
VINCENT (O.S.) The Prince's man called again. 
(DEFENSIVE) I'm just telling him. 
CUT TO: 
67 EXT. MALL PARKING LOT - NIGHT 67 
Bob and Stan drunkenly exit T.J. O'Toole's into the standard suburban mall parking lot. There is a bright multiplex sign. FAMILIES and TEENAGERS stroll. 
STAN I like consulting. No, I love it. Love it. And I'll say this for it, private business is efficient. There I said it. Fucking cliche. And the CIA is like what, a thirty billion a year business. so anybody wants to sell anything, a pencil, a computer, they gotta interface through a security clearance -- don't give me shit -- I got two kids in college and we're doing our kitchen. 
BOB Stan, I got a chance to go back. I want to go back. Is it safe for me? 
(CONTINUED) 
67 CONTINUED: 67 
STAN You talking about with your wife or the wackos? Bob doesn't say anything. He looks away. 
STAN (CONT'D) Clear it with Hezbollah... shit, I'm late to pick up Sue. Stan hits his remote lock and leaves Bob standing there. Wide shot of Bob alone in the mall lot gently sloping to IKEA cobalt blue in the distance. 
CUT TO: 
68 EXT. CAMPFIRE - NIGHT 68 
The bolt action of a gleaming hunting rifle. Danny D., the "oilman" whose Congressional testimony was broadcast on CSPAN, sights a weapon. 
DANNY D. Is the Caspian a lake or a sea? 
BENNETT Sea. Caspian Sea. Like seashore. 
DANNY D. Looks like Lake Michigan. Size of Lake Michigan. The Red Sea opens into the Indian Ocean -- Jimmy Pope and OTHER HUNTERS drink and clean thirty ought sixes, their faces lit by firelight. 
JIMMY Caspian's surrounded. Like a pond. Caspian pond. 
DANNY D. France and Russia want it to be a pond, that's for damn sure. The Caspian, I mean. In some court somewhere right now. 
(BEAT) Moot point, hopefully. An animal carcass rotates on a spit over the fire. 
(CONTINUED) 
68 CONTINUED: 68 
JIMMY 
(TO BENNETT) Mr. Janus, Chairman of Connex, and Dean Whiting, founding partner of your firm, are proud members of the Committee to Liberate Iran. Danny D. here is, too. 
DANNY D. D. is for Dalton. I was on the other side of the Tengiz deal. 
BENNETT The other side? 
JIMMY El Presidente Nazerbayev's best pal in the whole world. 
DANNY D. It's a beautiful field. Goddamn, is it a beautiful field. Danny hands a clean, checked rifle to Bennett. 
DANNY D. (CONT'D) I guarantee we'll let the air out of some tomorrow. 
69 EXT. 777 RANCH - HONDO, TEXAS - DAY 69 
A herd of zebra trots across a field and distant GUNSHOTS crack through the pine forest. This is a private game preserve, 10,000 acres of "conservation." A large sign shows a buck in cross-hairs and `777 Ranch - Experience Wildlife from Four Continents in Texas." 
DANNY D. (O.S.) I believe in getting inside their personal space. So it's you and him and nothing else. That's eighteen yards for a tiger or rhino... Bennett and Jimmy ride in the back of a "wagon," a modified shooting platform pulled behind a Jeep.

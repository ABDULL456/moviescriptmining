SARAH desperately tries to untie the huge knot that holds LUDO suspended upside down. She can't undo it and yells for HOGGLE 
SARAH: Get out here, you coward! 
HOGGLE appears from behind his hedge. He hesitates, then pulls a dagger from his belt and joins SARAH. He cuts through the rope in one hack, and LUDO falls to the ground with a thud. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
The nipper sticks start yammering away as they see SARAH and HOGGLE freeing LUDO over the top of the hedge. The GOBLIN chase stops and they head back to the clearing. HOGGLE dives for the bushes but a determined SARAH stays and pulls off the ropes. When LUDO is free, he picks up a huge log. As the FOUR GOBLINS come roaring back into the clearing, LUDO waves the log over his head. The GOBLIN charge immediately shifts into a GOBLIN retreat, the nipper sticks yipping in fear. 
ANOTHER ANGLE 
LUDO puts down the log and sits, his big shaggy head hanging down. He taken one hand and wipes away a tear. 
LUDO: Ludo ... hurt. 
SARAH's heart breaks. This thing is the ultimate stuffed animal. 
SARAH: Is that your name? Ludo? 
He nods and wipes away another tear. 
LUDO: Goblins ... mean to Ludo. 
SARAH: Oh, I know! They were terribly mean to you. (she moves closer and pats his arm) But it's all right now. 
LUDO sniffs and then breaks into the most endearing big dumb smile you have ever seen. 
LUDO: Friend! 
SARAH: That's right, Ludo! I'm your friend. I'm Sarah. 
LUDO: Sarah ... friend! 
HOGGLE has come out from hiding during this exchange. He finds the whole scene a bit nauseating. And an unnecessary nuisance. If there's one thing he doesn't want, it's competition for SARAH. 
HOGGLE: I think I'm about ta be sick. 
They ignore him and LUDO grins for all he's worth as SARAH beams up at him. HOGGLE pulls her over to one side. 
HOGGLE: I hope yer not thinkin' o' lettin' the beast traipse along, Missy. He'll just slow us up. 
SARAH: Are you kidding?! He'll be a great help! The goblins are scared of him because he's so fierce ... 
Just then LUDO shyly offers SARAH a flower that he has just picked for her. She takes it and smiles at him. 
HOGGLE (sarcastically): I sees what ya mean. 
SARAH shrugs and gives LUDO a pat. HOGGLE sighs with frustration. 
HOGGLE: I just thinks we was doin' fine on our own. 
SARAH: And we can do even better with Ludo. (turns to Ludo) You want to help me save my baby brother, don't you, Ludo? 
LUDO: Save ... baby. Good! 
SARAH nods with satisfaction and strides into the hedge maze. LUDO right behind her. HOGGLE follows, clearly unhappy. 
41	EXT: FOREST GATE - DAY 
SARAH, HOGGLE and LUDO come out of the hedge maze and see a wall with two SARAH-sized doors in it. 
HOGGLE: This is it, the entrance ta the Forbidden Forest. All we gotta do is pick a door ... 
SARAH: What difference does it make? Let's just go!

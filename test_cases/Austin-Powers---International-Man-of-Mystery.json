EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY \nThe lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES, including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID. \nANGLE ON:  A RING WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE RINGED HAND IS STROKING A WHITE FLUFFY \nCAT. \nDR. EVIL (face always unseen) Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good. As you know, my plot to high-jack nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage has failed.  Again.  This organization will not tolerate failure. \nHe presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip \nback and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and smoking. \nDR.

CARNABY STREET - DAY \nMUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES. \nWe start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet pants walking down the street in rhythm, \u00e0 la Saturday Night Fever. \nWe pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of Mystery.  He's a swinger, with \nmedium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National Health Services glasses. \nAustin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies. \nAustin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus. \nAustin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all start to twist to the music, including the Bobby. \nFREEZE FRAME - TECHNICOLOR BLUE TINT - TITLE CARD \n(PRODUCTION NOTE:  ALL TITLE CARDS WILL BE DONE IN TECHNICOLOR FREEZE FRAMES \u00c0 LA SWEET CHARITY.) \nIn the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area. \nOne wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears a see-through Mary Quant dress. \nAUSTIN (taking photos) Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout for me baby.  Smashing! \nWe see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in the stewardess outfit foes on all fours. \nAUSTIN Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder. Yes!  Yes!  Yes! (beat) No.  No. \nShow me love.  Yes!  And...done.  Here you go, luv.  I'm spent. \nAustin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground. \nThe driver of the Jag is Austin's associate, MRS. KENSINGTON, a beautiful woman in her thirties. \nThey drive against obvious REAR PROJECTION of 1960's London. \nAUSTIN Hello, Mrs. Kensington. \nMRS. KENSINGTON Hello, Austin Just then, a FLASHING RED LIGHT goes off and we hear a distinctive PHONE RING. \nMRS. KENSINGTON That'll be Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence. \nThe glove compartment revolves to reveal a picture phone. ANGLE ON:  PICTURE PHONE SCREEN.  We see BASIL EXPOSITION a distinguished older man.  A desk plate reads:  \"Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence.\" \nBASIL EXPOSITION (on picture phone) Hello, Austin.  This is Basil Exposition, Chief of British Intelligence. \nYou're Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery, and you're with Agent \nMrs. Kensington.  The year is 1967, and you're talking on a picture phone. \nAUSTIN We know all that, Exposition. \nBASIL EXPOSITION I just wanted to be extremely clear so that everyone knows what's going on at any given time.  We've just received word that Dr. Evil, the ultimate square, is planning to take over the world. \nAUSTIN Dr. Evil?  I thought I put him in jail for good. \nBASIL EXPOSITION I'm afraid not.  Earlier this week, Dr. Evil escaped from Zedel Edel Prison in Baaden Baaden and now he's planning a trap for you tonight at the Electric Psychedelic Pussycat Swinger's Club in Picadilly Circus here in swinging London. \nA panel revolves to reveal a map of London with lights showing Austin's position and the location of the club. \nAUSTIN Just where you'd never think to look for him.  We'll be there. \nBASIL EXPOSITION Good luck, Austin. \nAUSTIN Thank you. \nBASIL EXPOSITION Oh, and Austin&emdash \nAUSTIN Yes? \nBASIL EXPOSITION (pause) Be careful. \nAUSTIN Thank you. (to Mrs. Kensington) Let's go, baby! \nEXT.  STOCK FOTTAGE - PICADILLY CIRCUS - NIGHT \nOn top of one building is a three-story high BOB'S BIG BOY figure. \nEXT.  ELECTRIC PSYCHEDELIC PUSSYCAT SWINGER'S CLUB - NIGHT \nThe Jaguar pulls up in front of the swinging nightclub. Mrs. Kensington steps out of the car, dressed in a tight leather fightsuit.  She looks fabulous. \nINT.  ELECTRIC PSYCHEDELIC PUSSYCAT SWINGER'S CLUB \nIt's a swinging club.  FREAKS abound.  In one corner, there is a PRESS CONFERENCE in progress. \nMICK JAGGER Hey Austin Powers, it's me, Mick Jagger. \nAUSTIN Hey, Mick! \nMICK JAGGER Are you more satisfied now sexually, Austin? \nAUSTIN Well, you can't always get what you want. \nMICK JAGGER (thinking) \"You can't always get what you want!\" That's a great title for a song! I'm \ngonna write that, and it'll be a big hit. \nAUSTIN Good on ya, man. \nMICK JAGGER Groovy! \nFULL SCREEN INSERT \nA vinyl 45 of \"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\" \nFEMALE ANNOUNCER (on PA) Warm liquid goo phases complete.

EXAMINATION AREA \nTechnicians lead a half-asleep Austin to a screened area, where only his feet and head are visible.  He's washed off with a series of hot-water jets. \nFEMALE ANNOUNCER (on PA) Cleansing complete.  Stage Five, evacuation beginning. \nHe's given futuristic inoculations and then led to a screened- in toilet area.  We can hear the sound of PEE ENTERING THE BOWL. \nHe PEES for a while, then a little longer. \nAnd then EVEN LONGER STILL. \nThe stream seems to be subsiding...then begins STRONGER than ever. \nHe is still PEEING. \nFinally, it STOPS. \nFEMALE ANNOUNCER (PA) Evacuation com... \nHe begins PEEING again. \nA little LONGER. \nThen in short staccato BURSTS. \nThe it STOPS.  Pause. \nTwo DRIPS. \nFEMALE ANNOUNCER Evacuation... (waiting) Complete!  The cryogenic state of Austin Powers is now completed. \nAustin lies in a bed tilted up in an extreme angle \u00e0 la Dr. Frankenstein's lab.  NURSE TECHNICIANS administer injections and monitor electrodes, IV's, and other biological sensors. \nAUSTIN (weakly) Where am I? \nBASIL EXPOSITION You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997.  You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years. \nAUSTIN (shouting) WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? \nBASIL EXPOSITION The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process. \nAUSTIN Yes, I'm having trouble controlling&emdash (shouting) THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE! \nBASIL EXPOSITION You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence. \nAUSTIN Russian Intelligence?  Are you mad? \nBASIL EXPOSITION A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin.  The cold war's over. \nAUSTIN Thank God.  Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, \nhey Comrades? \nBASIL EXPOSITION We won, Austin. \nAUSTIN Groovy.  Smashing!  Good on ya! (to Gilmour) Nice tie.  Yea capitalism! \nCOMMANDER GILMOUR Mr. Powers, the President's very concerned.  We've got a madman on the loose in Nevada. \nBASIL EXPOSITION It's Dr. Evil. \nAUSTIN When do I begin? \nBASIL EXPOSITION Immediately.  You'll be working with Ms. Kensington. \nAUSTIN You mean Mrs. Kensington? \nEXT.  PLANE TAKING OFF - DAY \nWe see a plane taking off in silhouette. \nEXT.  PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY \nA multi-colored psychedelic jumbo jet with Austin's logo on the tailpiece. \nINT.  PRIVATE PSYCHEDELIC JET \nThe inside looks like Hugh Heffner's jet&emdash rust shag carpet, brown walls, and beads.  Austin and Vanessa sit on beanbag chairs.  Vanessa works on her lap top. \nAUSTIN Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh?  How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense? \nVANESSA I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector.  I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country.  It's very boring.  My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi.  If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative... \nAUSTIN That's fascinating, Vanessa.  Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag? \nVANESSA I beg your pardon? \nAUSTIN I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working. \nVANESSA Excuse me? \nAUSTIN My wedding tackle. \nVANESSA I'm sorry? \nAUSTIN My meat and two veg. \nVANESSA Mr. Powers, please.  I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand.  I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest. \nAUSTIN Have you ever made love to a Chigro? \nVANESSA A Chigro? \nAUSTIN You know, a Chigro&emdash part Chinese, part Negro&emdash Chigro. \nVANESSA (offended) We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive. \nAUSTIN That's right.  You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right? (spotting the flight attendants) Here's the stewardesses!  Bring on the sexy stews! \nThe STEWARDESSES enter.  They're not dressed very sexily. One of them is a man and another wears braces. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'? We're called 'flight attendants' now, thank you very much. \nAUSTIN Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a whore, I'm a sex worker', baby. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT My name is Mrs. Wilkenson.  There are a few things we need to discuss. First of all, we're not wearing these. \nShe holds up some skimpy, lingerie-type flight outfits. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT \nALSO, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ITINERARY.  IT SAYS HERE, '4:30 - DINNER, 5:30 - \nEveryone Gets Naked and Covered with Baby Oil, 6:00 - Orgy'? \nAUSTIN Seems pretty straightforward, don't you think...listen darling, I think you're a fabulous bird.  Can I get your telephone number? \nFLGHT ATTENDANT (mock sexy) Sure, it's easy to remember. (writing on his hand) It's 777-FILM.  We have to prepare the craft for take-off now. \nAUSTIN Smashing!  When we land I'll give you a tinkle on the telling bone. \nThe flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits. \nAUSTIN Brrrr!  She must be frigid.  There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag! \nThey're shag-mad, man!  Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest. \nVANESSA Sure. \nAUSTIN Do I make you horny? \nMUSTAFA But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is&emdash (holding up tennis ball) --work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day.  A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm... \nDR. EVIL And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth! \nANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH \nwho is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself. \nMUSTAFA We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash \nDR. EVIL (face unseen) Silence! \nANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT \nDr. Evil presses a button.  Mustafa's chair tips back and he falls backwards into a pit. \nMUSTAFA (blood-curdling scream) Ahhhhhhhhh! \nDR. EVIL (face unseen) Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure. \nMUSTAFA'S SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY \nANGLE ON:  DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS \nscar on his cheek. \nDR. EVIL Gentlemen, let's get down to business. \nMore muffled SCREAMS. \nDR. EVIL We've got a lot of work to do. \nMUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) Someone help me!  I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned. \nDR. EVIL (slightly distracted) Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time. \nMUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) Hello up there!  Anyone!  Can someone call an ambulance?  I'm in quite a lot of pain. \nDR. EVIL (very frustrated) You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me. \nHe picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it. \nMUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) If somebody can open the retrieval hatch down here, I could get out. See, I designed this device myself and...oh, hi!  Good, I'm glad you found me.  Listen, I'm very badly burned, so if you could just&emdash SFX:  Muffled Gunshot \nMUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) Ow!  You shot me! \nDR. EVIL Right.  Okay.  Moving on. \nMUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) You shot me right in the arm!  Why did&emdash SFX:  Muffled Gunshot. Dr. Evil waits.  Nothing. \nDR. EVIL Let me go around the table and introduce everyone.  Frau Farbissina... \nANGLE ON FRAU FARBISSINA \nDR. EVIL ...founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army.  Random Task... \nRANDOM TASK is a large Korean man in a butler's uniform. \nDR. EVIL ...a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman extraordinaire.  Show them what you do. \nHe stands up, bows, then takes off his shoe and THROWS it. It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room. \nDR. EVIL Thank you, Random Task.  Patty O'Brien... \nPATTY O'BRIEN, a small, wiry Irishman with fiery eyes. \nDR. EVIL ...ex-Irish assassin.  His trademark? \nAround PATTY O'BRIENS WRIST is a charm bracelet. \nDR. EVIL A superstitious man, he leaves a tiny keepsake on every victim he kills.  Scotland Yard would love to get their hands on that piece of evidence. \nPATTY O'BRIEN (heavy Irish accent) Yes, they're always after me lucky charms! \nFRAU FARBISSINA Yes. (calling out) Scott! \nSCOTT EVIL walks out.  He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a Kurt Cobain T-shirt. \nSCOTT EVIL Hi. \nDR. EVIL Hello, Scott.  I'm your father, Dr. Evil. (emotional) I have a son!  I have a son! Everyone, I have a son! (gesturing to globe) Someday, Scott, this will all be yours. \nSCOTT EVIL I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship?  I hate you! \nEXT.  JAGUAR - DRIVING - VEGAS - DAY \nVanessa and Austin drive in his perfectly-preserved Jag. \nAUSTIN You've preserved my Jag!  Smashing! \nVANESSA Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device.  Oh, and finally, this. \nThe glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various dental hygiene products&emdash floss, toothpaste, toothbrush, dental mirror, and cleaning tool. \nAUSTIN Let me guess.  The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device. \nVANESSA No, actually.  I don't know how to put this really.  Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry. \nAUSTIN Why?  What's wrong with my teeth? \nEXT.  VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT \nThe Union Jack-emblazoned Jaguar pulls up to the front door. \nINT.  VEGAS HOTEL ROOM \nVanessa carries her compact flight attendant bag and Austin takes his two bright red oversized leatherette Samsonite suitcases. \nAUSITN Which side of the bed do you want? \nVANESSA You're going to sleep on the sofa. I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, that the only reason we're sharing a room is to support our cover story that we're a married couple on vacation. \nAUSTIN So, shall we shag now, or shall we shag later?  How do you like to do it?  Do you like to wash up first? Top and tails?  A whore's bath? Personally, before I'm on the job, I like to give my undercarriage a bit of a how's-your-father. \nAUSTIN (off her angry reaction) I'm just joking, Vanessa.  Trying to get a rise out of you. \nThey both laugh. \nVANESSA Let's unpack. \nHER LUGGAGE:  In the inside flap is a types list of contents. All of her items are in separate, labeled plastic bags. \nAUSTIN Gor blimey, nerd alert. \nHIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a Nehru jacket and a huge Remington shaver with huge English plug. \nHER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a compact clothes steamer/travel iron and a Braun blow drier. \nHIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a vintage 1967 Playboy and a bottle of Jurgens lotion. \nHER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out Wet-Naps, her underthings in a plastic baggie marked \"Underthings\" and her shoes in a baggie marked \"Shoes.\" \nHIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a miniature meditation gong and Hai Karate cologne. \nHER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a dossier labeled \"Dr. Evil - Top Secret.\" \nHIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out the Swedish penis enlarger pump. Vanessa sees it. \nAUSTIN Hey, who put this in here?  Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine. \nVANESSA (suffering) I'm sure. \nAUSTIN I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling. \nAustin casually dials the phone while looking at his palm. After a beat we hear a loud MALE VOICE coming through the handset. \nMOVIE PHONE VOICE (through handset) Hello!  And welcome to 777-FILM! \nAUSTIN Yes, I also like to live dangerously. \nThe dealer deals him the ten. \nNUMBER TWO You're very brave. \nAUSTIN Cards are not my bag, man.  Allow myself to introduce...myself.  My name is Ritchie Cunningham. \nVanessa is mortified. \nAUSTIN (indicating Vanessa) This is my wife, Enid. \nNUMBER TWO My name is Number Two. \nHe extends his hand to shake.  Austin extends his hand, but misses and begins to shake the bimbo's breast.  There is an awkward pause.  Austin takes off his glasses. \nVANESSA (rescuing him) Number Two?  That's an unusual name. \nNUMBER TWO My parents were hippies. (indicating Italian woman) This is my Italian confidential secretary. \nITALIAN WOMAN (Italian accent) My name is Alotta (quickly) Alotta Fagina. \nAUSTIN I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it. It sounds like you're saying your name is a lot of...never mind. Listen, cats, I'm going to crash. It's been a gas. \nNUMBER TWO Bye-bye, Mr...Cunningham? \nAUSTIN Peace, baby. \nAustin and Vanessa leave. \nINT.  CASINO \nVANESSA Why did you leave so soon? \nAUSTIN That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch.  I get bad vibes from him, man.  Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog. \nHe heads to the rest room. \nINT.  HIGH ROLLERS TABLE - CASINO \nNumber Two has been watching them.  He presses a BUTTON. \nINT.  BATHROOM - CASINO \nAustin enters to see a gregarious TEXAN in a huge cowboy hat.  Austin enters a stall.  The Texan enters the adjoining stall. \nTEXAN Good luck, buddy.  You don't buy food, you rent it. \nAUSTIN Too right, youth. \nINT.  BATHROOM STALL \nAustin sits down.  Behind him, a panel SLIDES OPEN, revealing Patty O'Brien.  His charm bracelet JINGLES.  Austin looks back.  Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire.  He wraps it around Austin's throat.  Austin gets his thumbs between the wire and certain death. \nAUSTIN (grunting) Uh, uh! \nINT.  TEXAN'S STALL \nThe Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about frantically.  He can hear the \nGRUNTING. \nTEXAN Hey pardner, just relax, don't force it!  Use some creative visualization. \nINT.  AUSTIN'S STALL \nAustin GRUNTS and snaps his head back into Patty O'Brien's crotch.  Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony. \nPATTY O'BRIEN (groaning) Ughhhhh... \nAustin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty O'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it hovers above the toilet bowl. \nAUSTIN Who does Number Two work for? \nVANESSA What about his teeth? \nSPLIT SCREEN - HOTEL ROOM/MRS. KENSINGTON'S HOUSE \nMRS. KENSINGTON You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth.  It didn't matter. \nVANESSA I just don't see it. \nMRS. KENSINGTON Just wait.  Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out. \nVANESSA Did you ever... \nMRS. KENSINGTON Of course not.  I was married to your father. \nVANESSA Did you ever want to? \nMRS. KENSINGTON Austin is very charming, very debonair.  He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer.  Women want hin, men want to be him.  He's a lover of love&emdash every bit an International Man of Mystery. \nWe hear the TOILET FLUSH.  Mrs. Kensington WIPES off the screen. \nAustin re-enters from left to right, still NAKED.  Vanessa holds up Austin's Fab Magazine shoot from the Sixties, and in perfect timing blocks his crotch from the camera. \nVANESSA You didn't answer my question, Mum. \nMRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.) I know.  Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had. \nI will always love him. \nAUSTIN (V.O.) Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with? \nVANESSA (to her mother) Do you want to talk to him? \nMRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.) No, it's been too long.  Best to leave things alone. \nVANESSA (to Austin) I'm on with a friend! (to her mother) Look, I'd better go.  I love you. \nMRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.) I love you, Vanessa. \nVanessa hangs up.  Austin enters wearing an \"Austin Powers\" robe. \nAUSTIN Good morning, Vanessa!  I hope you have on clean underwear. \nVANESSA Why? \nAUSTIN We've got a doctor's appointment&emdash an evil doctor's appointment. \nEXT.  VIRTUCON MAIN ENTRANCE - DRIVEWAY - DAY \nTHROUGH BINOCULAR POV CUT-OUTS \nWe see a black limousine pull up in front.  Random Task and another BODYGUARD exit the limo and secure the area. \nEXT.  LAS VEGAS - BUSHES \nWe see that the binoculars belong to Vanessa.  She and Austin are on a stakeout.  Austin's Jag is in the background. \nVANESSA A limousine has just pulled up. \nAUSTIN Let me see. \nAustin pulls into frame an extremely long telephoto lens attached to his vintage camera. \nEXT.  VIRTUCON MAIN ENTRANCE \nTELEPHOTO LENS POV \nTwo more BODYGUARDS leave the building and approach the limo. Number Two exits the building \nholding Mr. Bigglesworth, the hairless cat.  He's not happy about this, and has a scratch on his cheek. \nFREEZE FRAME.  SFX:  Camera motor drive. \nEXT.  BUSHES \nAUSTIN I'm spent.  What say you we go out on the town? \nEXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - BUS - NIGHT \nAustin and Vanessa are on the top deck of an open air double- decker English bus having a full-course formal dinner. They're drinking champagne. \nAustin is cutting sausages into ever-smaller pieces, holding his cutlery very English.  He has cut one piece to the point to which it's a speck.  H puts it on the fork and offers it to her. \nAUSTIN Fancy a nibble? \nVANESSA I couldn't have another bite. \nThey laugh.  They drink.  It's TOM JONES, serenading them. \nThey begin to dance. \nAustin gives her roses.  Austin is wooing her. \nEXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT \nThey walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying each other's company.  Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock.  She graciously accepts. \n64  LAS VEGAS - SUPERIMPOSITION MONTAGE \nAustin and Vanessa stroll against a changing series of backgrounds&emdash neon signs, Vegas icons, dice showgirls, etc. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM \nSounds of MOANS and GROANS.  We see Austin's backside sticking out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled leg straining upwards. \nVANESSA (O.S.) Watch out, you're on my hair! \nAUSTIN (O.S.) Sorry.  Move your hand to the left. There you go.  Gorgeous. \nVANESSA (O.S.) Go!  Just go! \nWe hear a SPINNING SOUND. \nAUSTIN (O.S.) Left hand, blue. \nWe now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing TWISTER.  She reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing. \nAUSTIN Wait a tick, I forgot something in the lobby. (moving behind the couch) I know what.  I'll take the stairs. \nBehind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs. \nAUSTIN Maybe I'll take the escalator. \nAustin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator. \nAUSTIN Why take the escalator when I could take a canoe? \nAustin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch. \nVANESSA I haven't had fun like that since college. \nAUSTIN I'm sorry. \nVANESSA Why? \nAUSTIN I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die. \nShe laughs too much, making a SNORTING sound. \nVANESSA Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell. \nAUSTIN No, this is me in a nutshell. \nAustin mimes being trapped in a nutshell. \nAUSTIN Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind of nut has such a big nutshell?  How did I get into this bloody great big nutshell? \nVanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy. \nOne side of the chart is labeled \"Secret Projects.\"  Under that we see \"Human Organ Trafficking\", \"Carrot Top Movie\", and in CLOSE-UP&emdash \"Project Vulcan.\" \nWe see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a cross-section of the earth labeled \"Crust, Mantel, Core.\" \nAUSTIN And I'm spent. \nThe front door opens.  It's Alotta. \nAUSTIN You seem surprised to see me. \nALOTTA I thought you'd quit while you were ahead. \nAUSTIN What, and watch all my earnings go... (smug) Down the toilet? \nALOTTA What do you want, Mr...Cunningham, was it? \nAUSTIN Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina.  May I call you Alotta... (pause) Please? \nALOTTA You may. \nAUSTIN Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills. \nALOTTA Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes.  How did you know? \nAUSTIN (smug) I didn't, baby, you just told me. \nALOTTA It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham.  We can talk about business later.  But first, let me slip into something more comfortable. \nAUSTIN Behave! \nMUSIC:  \"The Look of Love\" by SERGIO MENDEZ AND BRAZIL 66 Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen.  In silhouette she takes off her clothes and puts on a robe.  She opens a pair of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto. \nINT.  JAPANESE BATH \nShe slips off her robe, revealing a DR. EVIL LOGO TATTOO on her shoulder, and enters the water. \nALOTTA Come in. \nAUSTIN I'd rather talk about Number Two. \nALOTTA Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know. \nAustin takes off his clothes.  He is extremely hairy.  He goes in.  Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over. \nALOTTA May I wash you? \nAUSTIN Groovy. \nShe washes his back.  Behind his back, she pulls out his wallet and looks through it.  ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION. It reads \"AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY.\" \nANGLE ON HIS VARIOUS CARDS:  CHARGEX, PLAYBOY CLUB, ETC. SHE PUTS HIS WALLET BACK IN HIS \ntrousers. \nALOTTA In Japan, men come first and women come second. \nAUSTIN Or sometimes not at all. \nALOTTA Care for some saki? \nAUSTIN Sak-i it to me! \nAlotta pours them saki.  Alotta unscrews the diamond in her ring.  A sign on the inside of her ring reads \"Relaxation Pills.\"  She drops two PILLS into his drink. \nAustin takes a sip.  His eyes glaze over.  He's instantly woozy. \nALOTTA How do you feel, Mr. Cunningham? \nAUSTIN Mmmm...I feel extreme relaxation. \nA big BUBBLE comes to the surface, right in front of Austin. \nAUSTIN (reciting poem) 'Pardon me for being rude, It was not me, it was my food. \nDR.

EVIL Fine, have it your way.  Gentlemen, you have five days to come up with one \nhundred billion dollars.  If you fail to do so, we'll set off the warhead and destroy the world. \nUNITED NATIONS SECRETARY You can't destroy the world with a single warhead. \nDR. EVIL Really?

Dr. Evil has high-jacked a nuclear warhead from Kreplachistan and is holding the world ransom for one-hundred billion dollars.  If the world doesn't pay up in four days, he's threatening to destroy the world. \nAUSTIN Thank you, Exposition.  Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war. \nBASIL EXPOSITION What's the other? \nAUSTIN Excuse me? \nBASIL EXPOSITION What's the other thing you're scared of? \nAUSTIN Carnies. \nVANESSA Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious \nfeeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.  I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse.  It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.  I'm sorry. \nAUSTIN Don't be sorry.  You're right to be suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged her rotten. \nVANESSA (stunned) I can't believe you made love to her just like that.  Did you use protection? \nAUSTIN Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic. \nVANESSA No, did you use a condom? \nAUSTIN Only sailors use condoms, man. \nVANESSA Not in the Nineties. \nAUSTIN Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me. \nVANESSA (pause) Well, it means something to me.  If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man. \nAUSTIN It was just a shag, Vanessa.  You're everything to me. \nVANESSA You just don't get it, do you, Austin? Good night.  Welcome to the Nineties, you're going to be very lonely. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nMUSIC:  \"What the World Needs Now\" by BURT BACHARACH Austin looks at his address book.

Beside Jimi Hendrix we see \"Deceased, Drugs\"; Janis Joplin, \"Deceased, Alcohol\"; Mama Cass, \"Deceased, Ham Sandwich\"; Jerry Garcia. \"Deceased, Gratefully\"; Jane Fonda, \"Square\". \nAustin looks at his old pair of Sixties-era canvas sneakers. He picks up his new pair&emdash REEBOK SHAQ CROSS-TRAINER PUMPS.  He pumps them too much and they explode. \nAustin looks out his window at the lonely city below.  We see the CDs he's just purchased, including SERGEANT PEPPER'S and BURT BACHARACH'S GREATEST HITS. \nAustin goes over to the kitchenette and puts a can of unopened Campbell's Tomato Soup in the microwave and turns it on.  It explodes in a shower of sparks and soup. \nHe puts the CD on a record player and drops the needle.  The NOISE is awful. \nAustin plays MORTAL COMBAT III.  His fighter gets his head ripped off, and blood spews out. \nAustin is genuinely frightened by this. \nINT.

The fall of the Berlin wall, a female Prime Minister of England, the abolishment of Apartheid, a fascinating tapestry of human strum und drang. \nAUSTIN Yeah, I can't believe Liberace was gay.  Women loved him, man.  I didn't see that one coming. \nVANESSA Basil was very concerned to know where you were last night. \nAUSTIN Out and about, doing odds and sods. \nVANESSA I'll tell him.

You're being very trippy. \nVANESSA I'm looking at you, and the whole time I can't help thinking you had your willie inside her hootchie-kooch. \nAUSTTIN Well put.  Listen love, we can't keep having this fight.  I'm an International Man of Mystery. Sometimes in the course of my work to save the world I have to shag some crumpet.  It's all part of the job. \nTOUR GUIDE Welcome to Virtucon, the company of the future. (pointing to large display window) Virtucon is a leading manufacturer of many items you'll find right in your own home.  We make steel, volatile chemicals, petroleum-based products, and we also own the Franklin mint, which makes decorative hand- painted theme plates for collectors. (holds up plate) Some plates, like the Gone With The Wind series, have gone up in value as much as two-hundred and forty percent, but, as with any investment, there is some risk involved. \nThe people on the tour APPLAUD. \nTOUR GUIDE Coming up on the left, we have the Virtucon gift shop, offering a wide range of Virtucon licensed products. On the right, you'll notice a door that leads to a restricted area. Only authorized personnel are allowed beyond that point. \nINT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA \nAll the tourists head for the gift shop.  Austin notices a SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the \"RESTRICTED AREA\" with a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear Virtucon coveralls. \nAUSTIN I'll take him, you take her. \nThe seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room; the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin and Vanessa follow. \nWe hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING KNOCKED OUT. \nAustin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly. They go through the doors into the restricted area. \nINT.  HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA \nThey approach the security GUARD. \nVANESSA Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges. \nAUSTIN Don't worry, baby.  I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India.  I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis. \nJust watch me.  Watch me, now. \nThey reach the guard. \nGUARD Hi, folks.  You're entering a restricted zone.  Can I see your security badges? \nAUSTIN Sure. \nThey flash their security badges to the guard. \nANGLE ON AUSTIN.  WE PUSH IN SLOWLY AS AUSTIN CONCENTRATES, RAISING ONE EYEBROW AND THEN THE \nother, back and forth. \nMUSIC:  Mystical Indian sitar. \nAUSTIN (hypnotist-like) Everything seems to be in order. \nGUARD (looking at the badges) Hey, wait a minute&emdash \nANGLE ON AUSTIN.  He redoubles his eye-brow-raising. \nAUSTIN Hang on!  I'm going to floor it! \nHe engages a lever.  It goes only slightly faster. \nTWO SECURITY GUARDS jump in front of the steamroller.  They are acting like they're frozen, ad if in the headlights of a fast-approaching car. \nGUARD Noooooooooooooo! \nAUSTIN Where did you learn to shoot? \nVANESSA Where did you learn to drive? \nANGLE ON THE GUARDS.  ONE OF THE GUYS JUMPS OUT OF THE WAY AS IF \"IN THE NICK OF TIME.\"  THE \nsteamroller is now 8 yards away.  The other army guy is still frozen in the path of the oncoming steamroller. \nGUARD Noooooooooooooo! \nVANESSA Austin, watch out! \nAUSTIN (looking around) Where?  Where? \nANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE'S BATHED IN THE HEADLIGHTS OF THE STEAMROLLER, WHICH IS STILL 3 YARDS \naway. \nGUARD Noooooooooooooo! \nANGLE ON AUSTIN AND VANESSA.  AUSTIN IS FRANTICALLY JERKING THE STEERING WHEEL AND TRYING TO \ndownshift.  SFX:  Metal grinds.  The shifter breaks off along with a gaggle of wares.  He desperately jams on the breaks. \nANGLE ON THE GUARD.  HE IS FINALLY RUN OVER BY THE STEAMROLLER.  THERE IS AN INORDINATE AMOUNT OF \nblood and guts. \nBy now, Austin and Vanessa are right by the door.  They run out into the hallway. \nINT.  HALLWAY \nThe coast is clear. \nVANESSA Thank God, Austin, we made it. \nAUSTIN Yes, act naturally and we'll split this scene the way we came in, Vanessa. \nFrom behind, a HAND knocks Vanessa and Austin out.  It is Random Task flanked by four SECURITY \nGUARDS. \nINT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY \nWe see the aftermath.  Several WORKMEN sweep up the blood and guts with large squeegees and brooms.  One of them turns to reveal \"Steamroller Accident Response Team\" written on his jumpsuit. \nAnother WORKMAN leans down to the body with a hand broom and dust pail to sweep up blood.  ZOOM IN on the steamrolled Army guy's ID tag, which reads \"STEVE HARWIN.\" \nEXT.  SUBURBAN HOUSE - LOS ANGELES \nIt is a pleasant, Marcus Welby-like ranch-style house.  We hear a PHONE RINGING. \nINT.  KITCHEN \nA pleasant-looking MIDDLE AGED LADY answers the phone. \nMIDDLE AGED LADY Hello? (pause) Yes, this is Mrs. Harwin. (pause) Yes, I have a son named Steve Harwin. (pause) Yes, that's right, he's a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army. (pause) What?  Killed? (pause) How? (pause) Run over by a steamroller?  Oh my God.  Thank you for calling. \nShe HANGS UP.  A FOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD enters. \nFOURTEEN-YEAR-OLD Hi Mom!  When's Steve coming home? He said he was going to teach me to play ball. \nMRS. HARWIN Sit down, Billy, I have some bad news.  As you know, your brother Steven was a henchman in Dr. Evil's Private Army. \nBILLY Was?  What is it, Mom? \nFEMBOT Hello, Mr. Powers, care to have a little fun? \nAUSTIN (looking at his watch) No, actually, I have to save the world. \nHe runs towards to door to exit.  Suddenly, A PAIR OF FEMALE LEGS drop and wrap around Austin's neck and lift him up. His feet leave the floor. \nAnother FEMBOT cartwheels up to Austin.  Nozzles pop out of the tips of the Fembot's bra. \nAUSTIN Is it cold in here? \nA cloud of multicolored gas spews from the nozzles.  Austin is overcome.  The room starts to spin. \nINT.  DR. EVIL'S MAIN CHAMBER - CONTROL AREA \nDr. Evil sits into his chair with his radiation suit on. \nDR. EVIL Arm the probe! \nA small electric flatbed comes in carrying the nuclear warhead.  A PHALANX of Dr. Evil's soldiers run beside it. The cart approaches the subterranean probe and the warhead is loaded up into its tail. \nINT.  FEMBOT'S LAIR \nAustin is on the bed being held down by the Fembots. Psychedelic music plays.  Projected colored swirling lights flash.  The Fembots swirl around seductively. \nAUSTIN (delirious) I've got to get Dr. Evil! (eyes closed, fingers in his ears) Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day!  Margaret Thatcher naked on a cold day!

DESERT \nVanessa leads fifteen COMMANDOS on ATCs across the sand. \nINT.  FEMBOT LAIR \nTwo Fembots guard the door and five are on the bed in come- hither poses. \nFEMBOT You can't resist us, Mr. Powers. Eventually you'll give in. \nAUSTIN Au contraire, I think you can't resist me. \nMUSIC:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme Austin starts his seductive dance.  He does a quick head count of the Fembots, reaches out of frame, pulls out eight cigarettes, put them in his mouth and lights them with a blowtorch. \nHe throws seven cigarettes one by one.  Each cigarette lands perfectly in a different Fembot's mouth.  Austin smokes the remaining cigarette. \nAustin begins to do a seductive striptease.  The Fembots are aroused.  He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest, and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot. \nShe begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and forth like in Jacob's Ladder. \nEventually her head explodes.  Austin is now stripped down to his Union Jack bikini briefs and \nturns to another Fembot.  Her head explodes. \nHe takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly. Then he tosses down his lit cigarette and grinds it with his bare foot.  He gives a look of disguised pain. \nHe mouths \"I love you\" to another Fembot.  Her head explodes. He does the 'I'll call you' hand signal to yet another Fembot, whose head explodes. \nAustin does a hip-thrust to another and her head explodes. Austin leans over and wags his rump to the two remaining Fembots. \nAUSITN Oh, I fell over. \nTheir heads explode simultaneously.  All the Fembots are lying on the floor, smoking.  Just then, Vanessa enters, flanked by a COUPLE OF COMMANDOS.  She surveys the scene and looks at Austin in his briefs.  She's hurt.  The commandos salute Austin. \nVANESSA I'll secure the perimeter. \nINT.  CONTROL AREA \nAustin enters the control area.  A VIRTUCON ARMY MAN fires at him.  Austin returns fires, shooting up some electrical equipment.  Live wires dangle dangerously.  Austin sees Mr. \nBigglesworth running out a read door. \nDR. EVIL (O.S.) Come, Mr. Bigglesworth! \nAustin heads for the door until he smacks into AN INVISIBLE FORCE FIELD.  He turns and sees a bank of old-fashioned computers labeled \"DESTRUCTACON 5000\". \nDESTRUCTACON (V.O.) Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000.  I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point.  You might as well surrender.  Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to \nAUSTIN Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin. \nDESTRUCTACON (V.O.) Yes, I am programmed to answer any question. \nAUSTIN Really?  Let me ask you this.  What is love? \nDESTRUCTACON (V.O.) That does not compute. \nAUSTIN Why not?

(to Austin) It's right over there. \nAustin sees the abort button.  It is across the room.  Just then, Random Task enters.  Austin sees him and goes to shoot him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off his SHOE. \nAustin makes his way across the room to the button. \nRandom Task THROWS HIS SHOE. \nANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR \nThe shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.  Austin pauses.  The shoe has not killed him.  It has just hurt him slightly. \nAUSTIN Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to have a lump there, you idiot!  Who throws a shoe?  You fight like a woman. \nEASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (on PA) Fifteen seconds and COUN-ting. \nRandom task blocks Austin's way to the button.  He stands there, menacing, missing one shoe. \nExposed wires are everywhere.  On the counter beside Austin is a Big Gulp. \nAUSTIN Care for a drink? \nAustin throws the drink at Random Task's feet.  It lands in front of him on a pile of exposed wires.  Electricity travels through the Big Gulp, up Random Task's wet sock, ELECTROCUTING him. \nHe begins to SMOKE, and then dies. \nAUSTIN Shocking. \nEASTERN EUROPEAN MAN Three...two...one... \nA 50 kiloton explosion from deep in the earth rocks the control area. \nEXT.

How was your day? \nSCOTT EVIL Well, me and a buddy went to the video arcade in town and, like, they don't speak English right, and so my buddy gets into a fight, and he goes 'hey, quit hassling me cause I don't speak French or whatever', and the other guy goes something in Paris talk, and I go 'um, just back off' and he goes 'get out' and I go 'make me'. \nDR. EVIL (trying to hide contempt) Fascinating.  What are your plans for this evening? \nSCOTT EVIL Thought I'd stay in.  There's a good tittie movie on Skinemax. \nDR. EVIL And that's how you want to live your life, is it? \nSCOTT EVIL Yeah.  What? \nANGLE ON A PANEL OF BUTTONS THAT HAS EVERYONE'S NAMES ON IT. DR. EVIL'S HAND HOVERS OVER THE \nbutton labeled \"SCOTT.\"  Frau Farbissina slaps his hand away. \nDR. EVIL Scott, I want you to meet Daddy's nemesis, Austin Powers. \nSCOTT EVIL Why are you feeding him?  Why don't you just kill him? \nDR. EVIL In due time. \nSCOTT EVIL But what if he escapes?  Why don't you just shoot him?  What are you waiting for? \nDR. EVIL I have a better idea.  I'm going to put him in an easily-escapable situation involving an overly- elaborate and exotic death. \nSCOTT EVIL Why don't you just shoot him now? Here, I'll get a gun.  We'll just shoot him.  Bang!  Dead.  Done. \nDR. EVIL One more peep out of you and you're grounded.  Let's begin. \nA PRIVATE ARMY SOLDIER grabs Austin and Vanessa.  Dr. Evil hits a button.  One whole wall slides out to reveal a tank. \nDR. EVIL Mr. Powers, Vanessa, some friends of mine are joining us for dinner. \n", "test2_true": "The soldier takes Austin and Vanessa to the tank and puts them in the dipping mechanism. \nAUSTIN Dr. Evil, do you really expect them to pay? \nDR. EVIL No, Mr. Powers, I expect them to die.  Even after they pay me the money, I'm still going to melt all the cities of the world with hot magma. (to guard) All right, guard, begin the unnecessarily Slow-Moving Dipping Mechanism. \nThe guard do so.  Austin and Vanessa begin to descend slowly towards the surface of the water. \nDR. EVIL Release the sharks! (to the room) All the sharks have had laser beams attached to their heads.  I figure every creature deserves a warm meal. \nFRAU FARBISSINA (clearing her throat nervously) Dr. Evil? \nDR. EVIL Yes, what is it?  You're interrupting my moment of triumph. \nFRAU FARBISSINA It's about the sharks.  Since you were frozen, they've been placed on the Endangered Species List.  We tried to get some, but it will take months to clear up the red tape. \nDR. EVIL (disappointed) Right. (to Austin) Mr. Powers, we're going to lower you in a tank of piranhas with laser beams attached to their heads. \nFrau clears her throat again. \nDR. EVIL What is it now? \nFRAU FARBISSINA Well, we experimented with lasers, but you would be surprised at how heavy they are.  They actually outweighed the piranha themselves, and the fish, well, they sank to the bottom and died. \nDR. EVIL I have one simple request&emdash sharks with friggin' laser beams attached to their heads, and it can't be done?  Remind me again why I pay you people? \nWhat do we have? \nFRAU FARBISSINA Sea bass. \nDR. EVIL Right. \nFRAU FARBISSINA They're mutated sea bass. \nDR. EVIL Really?  Are they ill-tempered? \nFRAU FARBISSINA Please allow me to demonstrate. \nFrau Farbissina throws a leg of lamb attached to a rope towards the tank, where the WATER BUBBLES and sea bass arch through the air.  The sea bass devour the lamb.  She pulls the rope back.  The lamb has been eaten to the bare bone. \nDR. EVIL Fine.  Whatever.  Mutated, ill- tempered sea bass it is. (to the room) Come, let's return to dinner.  Close the tank. \nSCOTT EVIL Aren't you going to watch them? They'll get away! \nDR. EVIL No, we'll leave them alone and not actually witness them dying, and we'll just assume it all went to plan. \nSCOTT EVIL I have a gun in my room.  Give me five seconds, I'll come back and blow their brains out. \nDR. EVIL No Scott.  You just don't get it, do you? \nDr. Evil presses a button; the wall closes back over the tank. \nINT.  TANK AREA \nAustin and Vanessa slowly descend towards the water.  They can see the WATER BUBBLING beneath them. \nVANESSA What's your plan? \nJust then, a SEA BASS jumps out of the water, just missing Austin. \nAUSTIN First, I plan to soil myself.  Then, I plan to regroup and think about the next move.  Any thoughts? \nVANESSA Sadly, no.  Hold on!  I always keep this on me just in case. \nShe pulls out a container of dental floss. \nAUSTIN All right, I get it.  I have bad teeth.  You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth. It didn't matter. \nVANESSA No, no, no.  We'll use the floss to get to the ledge. \nAUSTIN Smashing idea!  Give it to me. \nAustin takes the container and draws out four feet of dental floss and spins the container above his head like a bolo. He throws it and it wraps around a RADIATOR and it catches like a grappling hook. \n", "test3_input": "Austin begins drawing out the floss to take up the slack. Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the floss.  He keeps pulling out floss. \nMore floss still.  The mechanism continues to sink.  Finally, the floss line goes TAUT.  Austin ties it off high on the pole of the slow-dipping mechanism.  Austin holds out his hand like a surgeon&emdash \nVanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile the guard is reaching to undo the floss.  Austin places the open tube on his palm, aimed at the guard.  Vanessa WHISTLES at the guard loudly.  He turns around. \nAUSTIN Judo chop! \nAustin JUDO CHOPS the toothpaste tube, sending a stream of toothpaste into the guard's eyes. \nGUARD (screaming, rubbing his eyes) My eyes!  My eyes! \nAustin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing both ends. \nAUSTIN Hold on, Vanessa! \nShe grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water. Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared all over his face. \nHe and Austin STRUGGLE. \nThe guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's head dangling over the water.  SEA \nBASS circle.  The water boils, dangerously close to Austin's head. \nVANESSA (shouting) Austin, watch out! \nAustin FLIPS the guard over.  The SEA BASS chew the guard's head off like a blender. \nAUSTIN Not a good time to lose one's head. \nVANESSA Indeed. \nAUSTIN That's not the way to get ahead in life. \nVANESSA Yes. \nAUSTIN It's a shame he wasn't more headstrong. \nVANESSA Shut up. \nAUSTIN Fair enough. \nThey head out a door.  ANGLE ON THE HEADLESS TORSO.  The name tag reads \"JOHN SMITH.\" \nEXT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT - DAY \nIt is a sports bar-type restaurant that has scantily clad BUSTY WAITRESSES. \nINT.  HOOTERS RESTAURANT \nAt a table we see fifteen or so TWENTY-SOMETHING GUYS, scouting chicks, drinking mugs of beer. \nGUY 1 I can't believe John Smith is getting married tomorrow. \nGUY 2 Where is Smittie anyways?  It's not like him to be late for anything, especially his own stag party. \nGUY 3 Well, you know he's a henchman for Dr. Evil.  Sometimes they work late. Can I just say something that may sound a little sappy?  I think it's a testament to our friend John that so many of his buddies showed up in his honor.  There's a lot of love in this room. \nA large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone. \nWAITRESS Hi, I have a phone call here for the John Smith party. \nGUY 1 Hello? (pause) Yes, I have a friend named John Smith. (pause) That's right, he's in Dr. Evil's private army. (pause) What?  He's dead? (pause) Decapitated by mutated flying sea bass?  Oh my God!  OK, thank you. \nHe hangs up. \nGUY 2 (to Guy 1) Hey Bill, what's wrong?  Was that John?  Is he coming late? \nGUY 1 Guys, John's not coming. \nGUY 2 Why? \nGUY 1 He was decapitated by mutated flying sea bass. \n", "test3_true": "GUY 1 All right, to Smittie! \nEveryone raises their glasses. \nGUYS To Smittie! \nINT.  PSYCHEDELIC SCENE BREAK \nMUSIC:  Psychedelic Wa-wa Pedal Funky Drummer Beat TITLE GRAPHIC:  Out of Sight Austin and the go-go girl dance crazily. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nAustin and Vanessa drive a Dr. Evil golf cart down a brightly- lit, narrow corridor to a doorway marked \"Emergency Exit.\" \nVANESSA What do we do now? \nAUSTIN We've got a freaked out square and world annihilation is his bag.  You go get help.  I'm gonna stay here and keep an eye on the bad Doctor. \nVANESSA I'm not going anywhere.  We're a team. \nAUSTIN Too right, youth.  That's why I need you to lead the troops. \nVANESSA I'll hurry back. \nAUSTIN Listen, Vanessa, whatever happens, I just want you to know that I feel bad about shagging that Italian girl. I had a sip of sake and all of the sudden, I don't know what happened. The whole time I was shagging her&emdash I mean really shagging her, I mean it was crazy, I was like a huge mechanical piston, in and out, IN and OUT!&emdash \nVANESSA (cutting him off) Austin, what's your point? \nAUSTIN Anyways, what I'm trying to say is that if you want me to be a one-woman man, well, that's just groovy, because...I love you. \nVANESSA Oh, behave! \nVanessa goes out the door. \nINT.  LADDER \nVanessa starts climbing up the ladder. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nAustin tries to turn the cart around in the narrow corridor. He begins a twenty-seven point turn. \nINT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS \nDr. Evil, Scott and the evil associates finish dinner. \nDR. EVIL Come, everyone, let us repair to the main chamber.  Project Vulcan is about to begin.  Scott, are you coming? \nSCOTT EVIL I don't want to. \nDR. EVIL Don't you want to see what Daddy does for a living? \nSCOTT EVIL (under his breath) Blow me. \nDR. EVIL What did you say? \nSCOTT EVIL Show me. \nThey all go towards a giant door with the radiation symbol painted on it. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nAustin's still trying to turn the cart around.  PULL BACK TO REVEAL&emdash The cart is completely wedged perpendicularly in the corridor.  Austin jumps out and starts \nrunning down the hall.  Austin comes to a T in the hall and goes around the corner.  He sees two GUARDS and ducks into a door. \nINT.  FEMBOT LAIR \nInside are SEVEN FEMBOTS lounging in various seductive poses on Sixties furniture&emdash egg chairs, trapezes, round furry bed, etc. \nMUSIC:  Sexy Matt Helm-type theme \nAUSTIN Hello, hello. \n"}

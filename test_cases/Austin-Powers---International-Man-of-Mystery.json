Soon after, Austin Powers volunteered to have himself frozen, in the event Dr. Evil should ever return.  We believe Dr. Evil has begun yet another plot to take over the world.  And that, gentlemen, is why we're here. \nCOMMAND GILMOUR Outstanding re-cap, Exposition. \nCommand Gilmour opens a vault door.  COLD MIST escapes. \nINT.

Is he a British operative? \nBASIL EXPOSITION No, he worked freelance, an internationally renowned swinging photographer by day and the ultimate gentlemen spy by night. \nFinally, they come across Austin Powers: He is naked.  His hands cover up his private parts.  The look on his face suggests 'Oh my God, my bits and pieces are cold'.  His glasses are frosted over.

How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense? \nVANESSA I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector.  I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country.  It's very boring.  My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi.  If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative... \nAUSTIN That's fascinating, Vanessa.  Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag? \nVANESSA I beg your pardon? \nAUSTIN I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working. \nVANESSA Excuse me? \nAUSTIN My wedding tackle. \nVANESSA I'm sorry? \nAUSTIN My meat and two veg. \nVANESSA Mr. Powers, please.  I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand.  I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest. \nAUSTIN Have you ever made love to a Chigro? \nVANESSA A Chigro? \nAUSTIN You know, a Chigro&emdash part Chinese, part Negro&emdash Chigro. \nVANESSA (offended) We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore.

Bring on the sexy stews! \nThe STEWARDESSES enter.  They're not dressed very sexily. One of them is a man and another wears braces. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'? We're called 'flight attendants' now, thank you very much. \nAUSTIN Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a whore, I'm a sex worker', baby. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT My name is Mrs. Wilkenson.  There are a few things we need to discuss. First of all, we're not wearing these. \nShe holds up some skimpy, lingerie-type flight outfits. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT \nALSO, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ITINERARY.

Can I get your telephone number? \nFLGHT ATTENDANT (mock sexy) Sure, it's easy to remember. (writing on his hand) It's 777-FILM.  We have to prepare the craft for take-off now. \nAUSTIN Smashing!  When we land I'll give you a tinkle on the telling bone. \nThe flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits. \nAUSTIN Brrrr!  She must be frigid.  There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag! \nThey're shag-mad, man!

I will never have sex with you, ever.  If you were the last man on Earth and I was the last woman on Earth, and the future of the human race depended on our having sex simply for procreation, I still would not have sex with you. \nAustin is oblivious. \nAUSTIN What's you point, Vanessa? \nEXT.

EVIL (face again unseen) Ladies and Gentlemen, it's been a long time, but I'm back.  It's all gone perfectly to plan except for one small flaw.  Because of a technical error, my right arm was not frozen.  I was therefore by definition only partially frozen. \nANGLE ON EVIL ASSOCIATE MUSTAFA.  He is terrified and sweaty, eyes darting left and right. \nMUSTAFA But my design was perfect!  Your autonomic functions were shut down, and even though your arm wasn't frozen, the aging was retarded, therefore your right arm is only slightly older than the left. \nDR. EVIL Can't you see I'm only half a man?

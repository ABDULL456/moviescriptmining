LAS VEGAS (STOCK FOTTAGE) - NIGHT \nGRAPHIC:  1967 - SOMEWHERE IN NEVADA \nIt is set against the obvious skyline of Las Vegas. \nINT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS - DAY \nThe lair is 1960's high-tech.  We see a huge oversized conference table with six scary-looking EVIL ASSOCIATES, including a Latin American REVOLUTIONARY in a field jacket and turtleneck, TWIN NORDIC DOCTORS, and a METER MAID. \nANGLE ON:  A RING WITH DR. EVIL'S INSIGNIA ON IT.  THE RINGED HAND IS STROKING A WHITE FLUFFY \nCAT. \nDR. EVIL (face always unseen) Gentlemen, are we all here?  Good. As you know, my plot to high-jack nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage has failed.  Again.  This organization will not tolerate failure. \nHe presses a button.  The Revolutionary, the twin Nordic doctors, and the meter maid's chairs tip \nback and fall into a pit.  Their chairs return empty and smoking. \nDR. EVIL Mustafa... \nANGLE ON:  MUSTAFA, an Arab with a red Fez. \nDR. EVIL Frau Farbissina... \nANGLE ON FRAU FARBISSINA in a severe Salvation Army uniform. \nDR. EVIL I spared your lives because I need you to help me rid the world of the only man who can stop me now.  We must go to London.  I've set a trap for Austin Powers! \nEXT.  CARNABY STREET - DAY \nMUSIC:  Soul Bossanova by QUINCY JONES. \nWe start on a pair of BEATLE BOOTS and peg-top crushed velvet pants walking down the street in rhythm, \u00e0 la Saturday Night Fever. \nWe pan up to reveal AUSTIN POWERS, International Man of Mystery.  He's a swinger, with \nmedium-length Mod hair and sideburns and he wears National Health Services glasses. \nAustin walks along Carnaby Street taking photographs.  It is that perpetual bright sunny day you see in Sixties movies. \nAustin, bursting with life, gives a two-handed handshake to a MOD FREAK, who's just gotten off a red double-decker bus. \nAustin salutes a strolling BOBBY, then comes across TWO BEAUTIFUL MOD GIRLS who are excited to see him.  They all start to twist to the music, including the Bobby. \nFREEZE FRAME - TECHNICOLOR BLUE TINT - TITLE CARD \n(PRODUCTION NOTE:  ALL TITLE CARDS WILL BE DONE IN TECHNICOLOR FREEZE FRAMES \u00c0 LA SWEET CHARITY.) \nIn the middle of the street, THREE MODELS wait impatiently to be photographed in a makeshift photo shoot area. \nOne wears a short-skirted Stewardess outfit.  One wears a metallic silver pantsuit with matching cowl.  The other wears a see-through Mary Quant dress. \nAUSTIN (taking photos) Alright, luv!  Love it!  Turn...pout for me baby.  Smashing! \nWe see that AUSTIN HAS VERY BAD ENGLISH TEETH.  The model in the stewardess outfit foes on all fours. \nAUSTIN Crazy baby.  Give me some shoulder. Yes!  Yes!  Yes! (beat) No.  No. \nShow me love.  Yes!  And...done.  Here you go, luv.  I'm spent. \nAustin throws the camera in the air behind him.  An ASSISTANT scrambles and catches it before it hits the ground. \nThey enter.  Dr. Evil climbs into an egg chair. \nAUSTIN I've got you again, Dr. Evil! \nThe chair fills with a WHITE MIST. \nDR. EVIL (unseen, through mist) Not this time.  Come, Mr. Bigglesworth! (calling out) See you in the future, Mr. Powers! \nBefore the doors close, the white CAT jumps in the egg chair. A sign on the egg reads \"CRYOGENIC \nFREEZING BEGINNING.\" \nMRS. KENSINGTON My God!  He's freezing himself. \nAustin begins FIRING at the egg chair.  The ceiling opens up and the egg rises through the opening.  Everything begins to RUMBLE.  Rocket exhaust pours out of the ceiling. \nEXT.  ROOF - NIGHT \nThe Bob's Big Boy rocket begins to LIFT OFF. \nEXT.  CLUB - SIDEWALK - NIGHT \nPEOPLE outside the club react to the rocket. \nEXT.  EARTH FROM SPACE \nThe Bob's Big Boy rocket leaves the atmosphere.  Mr. Bigglesworth is pressed to the window like one of those stuffed Garfields. \nDR. EVIL (V.O.) (shivering) I'll be back, Mr. Powers, when free love is dead, and greed and avarice once again rule the world. \nEXT.  NORAD - COLORADO SPRINGS, COLORADO \nGRAPHIC:  1997 - NORAD - COLORADO SPRINGS THIS SCENE IS SHOT IN THE MULTIPLE SPLIT SCREEN STYLE, LIKE THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR: \n16  FULL SCREEN - INT.  NORAD TRACKING ROOM \nA BLIP appears on the radar screen. \nRADAR OPERATOR (on phone) Commander Gilmour? \n17  SPLIT SCREEN 2 - INT.  COMMANDER GILMOUR'S OFFICE \nCOMMANDER GILMOUR, a distinguished man in his fifties. \nRADAR OPERATOR (on phone) Commander, this is Slater in SoWest Com Three.  We have a potential bogey with erratic vectoring and an unorthodox entry angle. \nCOMMANDER GILMOUR (on phone) Is it one of ours? \nRADAR OPERATOR No.  Log Com Bird Twelve says its metalurg recon analysis is a standard alloy, not stealthy, not carbon- composite. (pause) It does have an odd shape, sir. \nCOMMANDER GILMOUR What are you saying, son? \nRADAR OPERATOR It appears to be in the shape of Bob's Big Boy, sir. \n18  SCREEN 3 - THE BOB'S BIG BOY ROCKET \nThe rocket is dirty and battered from thirty years in space. \nCOMMANDER GILMOUR Oh my God, he's back. \nDRAMATIC STING \nRADAR OPERATOR In many ways, Bob's Big Boy never left, sir.  He's always offered the same high quality meals at competitive prices. \nCOMMANDER GILMOUR Shut up. \nRADAR OPERATOR Should we scramble TacHQ for an intercept? \nCOMMANDER GILMOUR What's its current position? \n19  SCREEN 4 - A RADAR MAP OF NEVADA \nOn the radar screen it says \"NEVADA.\" \nFEMALE ANNOUNCER (on PA) Warm liquid goo phases complete.

He's washed off with a series of hot-water jets. \nFEMALE ANNOUNCER (on PA) Cleansing complete.  Stage Five, evacuation beginning. \nHe's given futuristic inoculations and then led to a screened- in toilet area.  We can hear the sound of PEE ENTERING THE BOWL. \nHe PEES for a while, then a little longer. \nAnd then EVEN LONGER STILL. \nThe stream seems to be subsiding...then begins STRONGER than ever. \nHe is still PEEING. \nFinally, it STOPS. \nFEMALE ANNOUNCER (PA) Evacuation com... \nHe begins PEEING again. \nA little LONGER. \nThen in short staccato BURSTS. \nThe it STOPS.  Pause. \nTwo DRIPS. \nFEMALE ANNOUNCER Evacuation... (waiting) Complete!  The cryogenic state of Austin Powers is now completed. \nAustin lies in a bed tilted up in an extreme angle \u00e0 la Dr. Frankenstein's lab.  NURSE TECHNICIANS administer injections and monitor electrodes, IV's, and other biological sensors. \nAUSTIN (weakly) Where am I? \nBASIL EXPOSITION You're in the Ministry of Defense. It's 1997.  You've been cryogenically frozen for thirty years. \nAUSTIN (shouting) WHO ARE THESE PEOPLE? \nBASIL EXPOSITION The shouting is a temporary side- effect of the unfreezing process. \nAUSTIN Yes, I'm having trouble controlling&emdash (shouting) THE VOLUME OF MY VOICE! \nBASIL EXPOSITION You might also experience a slight fever, dry mouth, and flatulence at moments of extreme relaxation. Austin, this is Commander Gilmour, Strategic Command, and General Borschevsky, Russian Intelligence. \nAUSTIN Russian Intelligence?  Are you mad? \nBASIL EXPOSITION A lot's happened since you were frozen, Austin.  The cold war's over. \nAUSTIN Thank God.  Those capitalist dogs will finally pay for their crimes against the people, \nhey Comrades? \nBASIL EXPOSITION We won, Austin. \nAUSTIN Groovy.  Smashing!  Good on ya! (to Gilmour) Nice tie.  Yea capitalism! \nCOMMANDER GILMOUR Mr. Powers, the President's very concerned.  We've got a madman on the loose in Nevada. \nBASIL EXPOSITION It's Dr. Evil. \nAUSTIN When do I begin? \nBASIL EXPOSITION Immediately.  You'll be working with Ms. Kensington. \nAUSTIN You mean Mrs. Kensington? \nEXT.  PLANE TAKING OFF - DAY \nWe see a plane taking off in silhouette. \nEXT.  PLANE IN FLIGHT - DAY \nA multi-colored psychedelic jumbo jet with Austin's logo on the tailpiece. \nINT.  PRIVATE PSYCHEDELIC JET \nThe inside looks like Hugh Heffner's jet&emdash rust shag carpet, brown walls, and beads.  Austin and Vanessa sit on beanbag chairs.  Vanessa works on her lap top. \nAUSTIN Pretty groovy Jumbo Jet, eh?  How does a hot chick like you end up working at the Ministry of Defense? \nVANESSA I went to Oxford and excelled in several subjects, but I ended up specializing in foreign languages. I wanted to travel -- see the world. In my last year I was accepted into the M.O.D. in the Cultural Studies sector.  I thought I was off on an exciting career, but my job was to read everything printed in every country.  It's very boring.  My whole day is spent reading wedding announcements in Farsi.  If I do well with this case, I finally get promoted to field operative... \nAUSTIN That's fascinating, Vanessa.  Listen, why don't we go into the back and shag? \nVANESSA I beg your pardon? \nAUSTIN I've been frozen for thirty years, man, I want to see if my bits and pieces are still working. \nVANESSA Excuse me? \nAUSTIN My wedding tackle. \nVANESSA I'm sorry? \nAUSTIN My meat and two veg. \nVANESSA Mr. Powers, please.  I know that you must be a little confused, but we have a very serious situation at hand.  I would appreciate it if you'd concentrate on our mission and give your libido a rest. \nAUSTIN Have you ever made love to a Chigro? \nVANESSA A Chigro? \nAUSTIN You know, a Chigro&emdash part Chinese, part Negro&emdash Chigro. \nVANESSA (offended) We don't use the term 'Negro' anymore. It's considered offensive. \nAUSTIN That's right.  You're supposed to say 'colored' now, right? (spotting the flight attendants) Here's the stewardesses!  Bring on the sexy stews! \nThe STEWARDESSES enter.  They're not dressed very sexily. One of them is a man and another wears braces. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT Excuse me, did you say 'stewardess'? We're called 'flight attendants' now, thank you very much. \nAUSTIN Oh, I get it, it's like 'I'm not a whore, I'm a sex worker', baby. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT My name is Mrs. Wilkenson.  There are a few things we need to discuss. First of all, we're not wearing these. \nShe holds up some skimpy, lingerie-type flight outfits. \nFLIGHT ATTENDANT \nALSO, I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE ITINERARY.  IT SAYS HERE, '4:30 - DINNER, 5:30 - \nEveryone Gets Naked and Covered with Baby Oil, 6:00 - Orgy'? \nAUSTIN Seems pretty straightforward, don't you think...listen darling, I think you're a fabulous bird.  Can I get your telephone number? \nFLGHT ATTENDANT (mock sexy) Sure, it's easy to remember. (writing on his hand) It's 777-FILM.  We have to prepare the craft for take-off now. \nAUSTIN Smashing!  When we land I'll give you a tinkle on the telling bone. \nThe flight attendant gives him a chilly stare and then exits. \nAUSTIN Brrrr!  She must be frigid.  There's two things I know about life: one, Americans will never take to soccer. Two, Swedish girls and stewardesses love to shag! \nThey're shag-mad, man!  Let me ask you a question, Vanessa, and be honest. \nVANESSA Sure. \nAUSTIN Do I make you horny? \nMUSTAFA But Dr. Evil, all you need to do is&emdash (holding up tennis ball) --work with this tennis ball.  Squeeze it for twenty minutes a day.  A few months of that and it'll be just as strong as the other arm... \nDR. EVIL And look what you've done to Mr. Bigglesworth! \nANGLE ON MR. BIGGLESWORTH \nwho is now totally hairless, with a fringe of white hair around it's ears, like Dr. Evil himself. \nMUSTAFA We could not anticipate feline complications due to the reanimation process&emdash \nDR. EVIL (face unseen) Silence! \nANGLE ON A HAND WITH DR. EVIL'S RING ON IT \nDr. Evil presses a button.  Mustafa's chair tips back and he falls backwards into a pit. \nMUSTAFA (blood-curdling scream) Ahhhhhhhhh! \nDR. EVIL (face unseen) Let this be a reminder to you all that this organization will not tolerate failure. \nMUSTAFA'S SCREAMS ECHO FAINTLY \nANGLE ON:  DR. EVIL FOR THE FIRST TIME.  HE IS IN HIS EARLY FIFTIES AND IS BALD, WITH A HIDEOUS \nscar on his cheek. \nDR. EVIL Gentlemen, let's get down to business. \nMore muffled SCREAMS. \nDR. EVIL We've got a lot of work to do. \nMUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) Someone help me!  I'm still alive, only I'm very badly burned. \nDR. EVIL (slightly distracted) Some of you I know, some of you I'm meeting for the first time. \nMUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) Hello up there!  Anyone!  Can someone call an ambulance?  I'm in quite a lot of pain. \nDR. EVIL (very frustrated) You've all been gathered here to form my Evil Cabinet.  Excuse me. \nHe picks up a white phone and MURMURS into it. \nMUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) If somebody can open the retrieval hatch down here, I could get out. See, I designed this device myself and...oh, hi!  Good, I'm glad you found me.  Listen, I'm very badly burned, so if you could just&emdash SFX:  Muffled Gunshot \nMUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) Ow!  You shot me! \nDR. EVIL Right.  Okay.  Moving on. \nMUSTAFA (O.S.) (muffled) You shot me right in the arm!  Why did&emdash SFX:  Muffled Gunshot. Dr. Evil waits.  Nothing. \nDR. EVIL Let me go around the table and introduce everyone.  Frau Farbissina... \nANGLE ON FRAU FARBISSINA \nDR. EVIL ...founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army.  Random Task... \nRANDOM TASK is a large Korean man in a butler's uniform. \nDR. EVIL ...a Korean ex-wrestler, evil handyman extraordinaire.  Show them what you do. \nHe stands up, bows, then takes off his shoe and THROWS it. It knocks the head off a sculpture across the room. \nDR. EVIL Thank you, Random Task.  Patty O'Brien... \nPATTY O'BRIEN, a small, wiry Irishman with fiery eyes. \nDR. EVIL ...ex-Irish assassin.  His trademark? \nAround PATTY O'BRIENS WRIST is a charm bracelet. \nDR. EVIL A superstitious man, he leaves a tiny keepsake on every victim he kills.  Scotland Yard would love to get their hands on that piece of evidence. \nPATTY O'BRIEN (heavy Irish accent) Yes, they're always after me lucky charms! \nFRAU FARBISSINA Yes. (calling out) Scott! \nSCOTT EVIL walks out.  He is fifteen, grungy, and wears a Kurt Cobain T-shirt. \nSCOTT EVIL Hi. \nDR. EVIL Hello, Scott.  I'm your father, Dr. Evil. (emotional) I have a son!  I have a son! Everyone, I have a son! (gesturing to globe) Someday, Scott, this will all be yours. \nSCOTT EVIL I haven't seen you my whole life and now you show up and want a relationship?  I hate you! \nEXT.  JAGUAR - DRIVING - VEGAS - DAY \nVanessa and Austin drive in his perfectly-preserved Jag. \nAUSTIN You've preserved my Jag!  Smashing! \nVANESSA Yes, we've had it retrofitted with a secure cellular phone, an on-board computer, and a Global Geosynchronous Positioning Device.  Oh, and finally, this. \nThe glove compartment revolves to reveal a display of various dental hygiene products&emdash floss, toothpaste, toothbrush, dental mirror, and cleaning tool. \nAUSTIN Let me guess.  The floss is garotte wire, the toothpaste contains plastic explosives, and the toothbrush is the detonation device. \nVANESSA No, actually.  I don't know how to put this really.  Well, there have been fabulous advances in the field of dentistry. \nAUSTIN Why?  What's wrong with my teeth? \nEXT.  VEGAS HOTEL - NIGHT \nThe Union Jack-emblazoned Jaguar pulls up to the front door. \nINT.  VEGAS HOTEL ROOM \nVanessa carries her compact flight attendant bag and Austin takes his two bright red oversized leatherette Samsonite suitcases. \nAUSITN Which side of the bed do you want? \nVANESSA You're going to sleep on the sofa. I'd like to remind you, Mr. Powers, that the only reason we're sharing a room is to support our cover story that we're a married couple on vacation. \nAUSTIN So, shall we shag now, or shall we shag later?  How do you like to do it?  Do you like to wash up first? Top and tails?  A whore's bath? Personally, before I'm on the job, I like to give my undercarriage a bit of a how's-your-father. \nAUSTIN (off her angry reaction) I'm just joking, Vanessa.  Trying to get a rise out of you. \nThey both laugh. \nVANESSA Let's unpack. \nHER LUGGAGE:  In the inside flap is a types list of contents. All of her items are in separate, labeled plastic bags. \nAUSTIN Gor blimey, nerd alert. \nHIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a Nehru jacket and a huge Remington shaver with huge English plug. \nHER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a compact clothes steamer/travel iron and a Braun blow drier. \nHIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a vintage 1967 Playboy and a bottle of Jurgens lotion. \nHER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out Wet-Naps, her underthings in a plastic baggie marked \"Underthings\" and her shoes in a baggie marked \"Shoes.\" \nHIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out a miniature meditation gong and Hai Karate cologne. \nHER LUGGAGE:  She pulls out a dossier labeled \"Dr. Evil - Top Secret.\" \nHIS LUGGAGE:  He pulls out the Swedish penis enlarger pump. Vanessa sees it. \nAUSTIN Hey, who put this in here?  Someone's playing a prank on me!  Honestly, this isn't mine. \nVANESSA (suffering) I'm sure. \nAUSTIN I think I'll give that stew a ding-a- ling. \nAustin casually dials the phone while looking at his palm. After a beat we hear a loud MALE VOICE coming through the handset. \nMOVIE PHONE VOICE (through handset) Hello!  And welcome to 777-FILM! \nAUSTIN Yes, I also like to live dangerously. \nThe dealer deals him the ten. \nNUMBER TWO You're very brave. \nAUSTIN Cards are not my bag, man.  Allow myself to introduce...myself.  My name is Ritchie Cunningham. \nVanessa is mortified. \nAUSTIN (indicating Vanessa) This is my wife, Enid. \nNUMBER TWO My name is Number Two. \nHe extends his hand to shake.  Austin extends his hand, but misses and begins to shake the bimbo's breast.  There is an awkward pause.  Austin takes off his glasses. \nVANESSA (rescuing him) Number Two?  That's an unusual name. \nNUMBER TWO My parents were hippies. (indicating Italian woman) This is my Italian confidential secretary. \nITALIAN WOMAN (Italian accent) My name is Alotta (quickly) Alotta Fagina. \nAUSTIN I'm sorry, I'm just not getting it. It sounds like you're saying your name is a lot of...never mind. Listen, cats, I'm going to crash. It's been a gas. \nNUMBER TWO Bye-bye, Mr...Cunningham? \nAUSTIN Peace, baby. \nAustin and Vanessa leave. \nINT.  CASINO \nVANESSA Why did you leave so soon? \nAUSTIN That cat Number Two has an X-ray eyepatch.  I get bad vibes from him, man.  Listen, we should go back to the room, but first I have to go to the naughty chair and see a man about a dog. \nHe heads to the rest room. \nINT.  HIGH ROLLERS TABLE - CASINO \nNumber Two has been watching them.  He presses a BUTTON. \nINT.  BATHROOM - CASINO \nAustin enters to see a gregarious TEXAN in a huge cowboy hat.  Austin enters a stall.  The Texan enters the adjoining stall. \nTEXAN Good luck, buddy.  You don't buy food, you rent it. \nAUSTIN Too right, youth. \nINT.  BATHROOM STALL \nAustin sits down.  Behind him, a panel SLIDES OPEN, revealing Patty O'Brien.  His charm bracelet JINGLES.  Austin looks back.  Patty's bracelet is now garotte wire.  He wraps it around Austin's throat.  Austin gets his thumbs between the wire and certain death. \nAUSTIN (grunting) Uh, uh! \nINT.  TEXAN'S STALL \nThe Texan can only see Austin's feet, which are moving about frantically.  He can hear the \nGRUNTING. \nTEXAN Hey pardner, just relax, don't force it!  Use some creative visualization. \nINT.  AUSTIN'S STALL \nAustin GRUNTS and snaps his head back into Patty O'Brien's crotch.  Patty O'Brien GROANS in agony. \nPATTY O'BRIEN (groaning) Ughhhhh... \nAustin breaks free of the charm bracelet/garotte, grabs Patty O'Brien's head, and pulls it between his legs so that it hovers above the toilet bowl. \nAUSTIN Who does Number Two work for? \nVANESSA What about his teeth? \nSPLIT SCREEN - HOTEL ROOM/MRS. KENSINGTON'S HOUSE \nMRS. KENSINGTON You have to understand, in Britain in the Sixties you could be a sex symbol and still have bad teeth.  It didn't matter. \nVANESSA I just don't see it. \nMRS. KENSINGTON Just wait.  Once Austin gets you in his charms, it's impossible to get out. \nVANESSA Did you ever... \nMRS. KENSINGTON Of course not.  I was married to your father. \nVANESSA Did you ever want to? \nMRS. KENSINGTON Austin is very charming, very debonair.  He's handsome, witty, has a knowledge of fine wines, sophisticated, a world-renowned photographer.  Women want hin, men want to be him.  He's a lover of love&emdash every bit an International Man of Mystery. \nWe hear the TOILET FLUSH.  Mrs. Kensington WIPES off the screen. \nAustin re-enters from left to right, still NAKED.  Vanessa holds up Austin's Fab Magazine shoot from the Sixties, and in perfect timing blocks his crotch from the camera. \nVANESSA You didn't answer my question, Mum. \nMRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.) I know.  Let me just say this: Austin was the most loyal and caring friend I ever had. \nI will always love him. \nAUSTIN (V.O.) Good morning, luv, who are you on the phone with? \nVANESSA (to her mother) Do you want to talk to him? \nMRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.) No, it's been too long.  Best to leave things alone. \nVANESSA (to Austin) I'm on with a friend! (to her mother) Look, I'd better go.  I love you. \nMRS. KENSINGTON (V.O.) I love you, Vanessa. \nVanessa hangs up.  Austin enters wearing an \"Austin Powers\" robe. \nAUSTIN Good morning, Vanessa!  I hope you have on clean underwear. \nVANESSA Why? \nAUSTIN We've got a doctor's appointment&emdash an evil doctor's appointment. \nEXT.  VIRTUCON MAIN ENTRANCE - DRIVEWAY - DAY \nTHROUGH BINOCULAR POV CUT-OUTS \nWe see a black limousine pull up in front.  Random Task and another BODYGUARD exit the limo and secure the area. \nEXT.  LAS VEGAS - BUSHES \nWe see that the binoculars belong to Vanessa.  She and Austin are on a stakeout.  Austin's Jag is in the background. \nVANESSA A limousine has just pulled up. \nAUSTIN Let me see. \nAustin pulls into frame an extremely long telephoto lens attached to his vintage camera. \nEXT.  VIRTUCON MAIN ENTRANCE \nTELEPHOTO LENS POV \nTwo more BODYGUARDS leave the building and approach the limo. Number Two exits the building \nholding Mr. Bigglesworth, the hairless cat.  He's not happy about this, and has a scratch on his cheek. \nFREEZE FRAME.  SFX:  Camera motor drive. \nEXT.  BUSHES \nAUSTIN I'm spent.  What say you we go out on the town? \nEXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - BUS - NIGHT \nAustin and Vanessa are on the top deck of an open air double- decker English bus having a full-course formal dinner. They're drinking champagne. \nAustin is cutting sausages into ever-smaller pieces, holding his cutlery very English.  He has cut one piece to the point to which it's a speck.  H puts it on the fork and offers it to her. \nAUSTIN Fancy a nibble? \nVANESSA I couldn't have another bite. \nThey laugh.  They drink.  It's TOM JONES, serenading them. \nThey begin to dance. \nAustin gives her roses.  Austin is wooing her. \nEXT.  LAS VEGAS STREET - NIGHT \nThey walk along the brightly-lit streets, laughing, enjoying each other's company.  Austin gives Vanessa a pet rock.  She graciously accepts. \n64  LAS VEGAS - SUPERIMPOSITION MONTAGE \nAustin and Vanessa stroll against a changing series of backgrounds&emdash neon signs, Vegas icons, dice showgirls, etc. \nINT.  HOTEL ROOM \nSounds of MOANS and GROANS.  We see Austin's backside sticking out above a piece of furniture, then Vanessa's high-heeled leg straining upwards. \nVANESSA (O.S.) Watch out, you're on my hair! \nAUSTIN (O.S.) Sorry.  Move your hand to the left. There you go.  Gorgeous. \nVANESSA (O.S.) Go!  Just go! \nWe hear a SPINNING SOUND. \nAUSTIN (O.S.) Left hand, blue. \nWe now see that Austin and Vanessa are playing TWISTER.  She reaches for left hand blue and they fall over, laughing. \nAUSTIN Wait a tick, I forgot something in the lobby. (moving behind the couch) I know what.  I'll take the stairs. \nBehind the couch, Austin mimes going down stairs. \nAUSTIN Maybe I'll take the escalator. \nAustin mimes the smooth descent of an escalator. \nAUSTIN Why take the escalator when I could take a canoe? \nAustin mimes rowing a canoe behind the couch. \nVANESSA I haven't had fun like that since college. \nAUSTIN I'm sorry. \nVANESSA Why? \nAUSTIN I'm sorry that bug up your ass had to die. \nShe laughs too much, making a SNORTING sound. \nVANESSA Always wanting to have fun, that's you in a nutshell. \nAUSTIN No, this is me in a nutshell. \nAustin mimes being trapped in a nutshell. \nAUSTIN Help!  I'm in a nutshell!  What kind of nut has such a big nutshell?  How did I get into this bloody great big nutshell? \nVanessa laughs again, SNORTING, tipsy. \nOne side of the chart is labeled \"Secret Projects.\"  Under that we see \"Human Organ Trafficking\", \"Carrot Top Movie\", and in CLOSE-UP&emdash \"Project Vulcan.\" \nWe see schematics for some sort of subterranean probe and a cross-section of the earth labeled \"Crust, Mantel, Core.\" \nAUSTIN And I'm spent. \nThe front door opens.  It's Alotta. \nAUSTIN You seem surprised to see me. \nALOTTA I thought you'd quit while you were ahead. \nAUSTIN What, and watch all my earnings go... (smug) Down the toilet? \nALOTTA What do you want, Mr...Cunningham, was it? \nAUSTIN Call me Ritchie, Miss Fagina.  May I call you Alotta... (pause) Please? \nALOTTA You may. \nAUSTIN Your boss, Number Two, I understand that cat's involved in big underground drills. \nALOTTA Virtucon's main interest is in cable television, but they do have a subterranean construction division, yes.  How did you know? \nAUSTIN (smug) I didn't, baby, you just told me. \nALOTTA It's for the mining industry, Mr. Cunningham.  We can talk about business later.  But first, let me slip into something more comfortable. \nAUSTIN Behave! \nMUSIC:  \"The Look of Love\" by SERGIO MENDEZ AND BRAZIL 66 Alotta goes behind a Japanese screen.  In silhouette she takes off her clothes and puts on a robe.  She opens a pair of sliding doors to reveal an elaborate Japanese bath grotto. \nINT.  JAPANESE BATH \nShe slips off her robe, revealing a DR. EVIL LOGO TATTOO on her shoulder, and enters the water. \nALOTTA Come in. \nAUSTIN I'd rather talk about Number Two. \nALOTTA Don't you like girls, Mr. Cunningham? Come in, and I'll show you everything you need to know. \nAustin takes off his clothes.  He is extremely hairy.  He goes in.  Alotta produces a soapy sponge and swims over. \nALOTTA May I wash you? \nAUSTIN Groovy. \nShe washes his back.  Behind his back, she pulls out his wallet and looks through it.  ANGLE ON HIS IDENTIFICATION. It reads \"AUSTIN POWERS, INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY.\" \nANGLE ON HIS VARIOUS CARDS:  CHARGEX, PLAYBOY CLUB, ETC. SHE PUTS HIS WALLET BACK IN HIS \ntrousers. \nALOTTA In Japan, men come first and women come second. \nAUSTIN Or sometimes not at all. \nALOTTA Care for some saki? \nAUSTIN Sak-i it to me! \nAlotta pours them saki.  Alotta unscrews the diamond in her ring.  A sign on the inside of her ring reads \"Relaxation Pills.\"  She drops two PILLS into his drink. \nAustin takes a sip.  His eyes glaze over.

Only two things, scare me, and one is nuclear war. \nBASIL EXPOSITION What's the other? \nAUSTIN Excuse me? \nBASIL EXPOSITION What's the other thing you're scared of? \nAUSTIN Carnies. \nVANESSA Listen, I know I'm just being neurotic, but I can't shake this suspicious \nfeeling about that Italian secretary, Ms. Fagina.  I mean, I don't want to sound paranoid, but I've had some bad relationships in the past, and I have some jealousy issues. You went to her penthouse.  It makes me feel so small to give into these insecurities, but I can't help but feel this weird, irrational, unfocused...well, jealousy.  I'm sorry. \nAUSTIN Don't be sorry.  You're right to be suspicious.  I shagged her.  I shagged her rotten. \nVANESSA (stunned) I can't believe you made love to her just like that.  Did you use protection? \nAUSTIN Of course, I had my nine-millimeter automatic. \nVANESSA No, did you use a condom? \nAUSTIN Only sailors use condoms, man. \nVANESSA Not in the Nineties. \nAUSTIN Well they should, filthy beggars, they go from port to port.  Alotta meant nothing to me. \nVANESSA (pause) Well, it means something to me.  If you want us to have a relationship, you've got to be a one-woman man. \nAUSTIN It was just a shag, Vanessa.

It won't just be active volcanoes, inactive ones will erupt as well. Seven-eighths of the Earth's land mass will be deluged with hot magma. Tectonic plates will shift, causing massive earthquakes.

Meanwhile, the slow-dipping mechanism is edging towards the sea bass.  Unfortunately, Austin is still drawing out the floss.  He keeps pulling out floss. \nMore floss still.

Austin holds out his hand like a surgeon&emdash \nVanessa places a tube of toothpaste in his hand.  Meanwhile the guard is reaching to undo the floss.

My eyes! \nAustin folds the tube across the top of the wire, grabbing both ends. \nAUSTIN Hold on, Vanessa! \nShe grabs onto him and they slide down the floss to safety right as the dipping mechanism goes under the water. Meanwhile, the guard waits for them with toothpaste smeared all over his face. \nHe and Austin STRUGGLE. \nThe guard manages to get Austin pinned to the ground, Austin's head dangling over the water.

Can I just say something that may sound a little sappy?  I think it's a testament to our friend John that so many of his buddies showed up in his honor.  There's a lot of love in this room. \nA large-breasted WAITRESS approaches with a phone. \nWAITRESS Hi, I have a phone call here for the John Smith party. \nGUY 1 Hello?

He takes off his shirt, revealing his hairy chest, and focuses his sexual energy on one Fembot. \nShe begins to shake violently, her head shaking back and forth like in Jacob's Ladder. \nEventually her head explodes.  Austin is now stripped down to his Union Jack bikini briefs and \nturns to another Fembot.  Her head explodes. \nHe takes off his shoes and throws them away cavalierly.

VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA \nAll the tourists head for the gift shop.  Austin notices a SEVEN-FOOT-TALL SCIENTIST leaving the \"RESTRICTED AREA\" with a FOUR-HUNDRED-POUND FEMALE SCIENTIST.  They both wear Virtucon coveralls. \nAUSTIN I'll take him, you take her. \nThe seven-foot-tall male scientist goes to the men's room; the four-hundred-pound woman goes to the ladies room.  Austin and Vanessa follow. \nWe hear from inside either washroom the sound of PEOPLE BEING KNOCKED OUT. \nAustin and Vanessa exit wearing the scientists' coveralls over their clothes.  Magically, the coveralls fit perfectly. They go through the doors into the restricted area. \nINT.  HALLWAY - RESTRICTED AREA \nThey approach the security GUARD. \nVANESSA Austin, we don't look anything like our photo badges. \nAUSTIN Don't worry, baby.  I picked up a mind control technique during my travels to India.  I learned it from my guru, the late Guru Shastri, a chaste man who mysteriously died of a disease that had all the hallmarks of syphilis. \nJust watch me.  Watch me, now. \nThey reach the guard. \nGUARD Hi, folks.  You're entering a restricted zone.  Can I see your security badges? \nAUSTIN Sure. \nThey flash their security badges to the guard. \nANGLE ON AUSTIN.  WE PUSH IN SLOWLY AS AUSTIN CONCENTRATES, RAISING ONE EYEBROW AND THEN THE \nother, back and forth. \nMUSIC:  Mystical Indian sitar. \nAUSTIN (hypnotist-like) Everything seems to be in order. \nGUARD (looking at the badges) Hey, wait a minute&emdash \nANGLE ON AUSTIN.  He redoubles his eye-brow-raising. \n", "test2_true": "VANESSA That's amazing.  Let's go! \nAUSTIN Hold on one second. \nAustin again does his mind control trick. \nAUSTIN Here, have a piece of gum. \nGUARD (in trace) Here, have a piece of gum. \nHe hands Austin a piece of gum. \nAUSTIN Don't mind if I do. \nGUARD (slipping out of trance) Hey!  Wait a minute, that's my last piece of gum. \nAustin does his mind-control again. \nAUSTIN No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece. \nGUARD (trance-like) No, no, I want you to have it, even if it's my last piece. \nAUSTIN (mind-controlling) I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert. \nVANESSA (irritated) Austin, we have to go! \nShe pulls him away. \nGUARD (O.S.) (faintly) I'm going to go across the street and get you some sherbert. \nAustin and Vanessa come to a door marked \"PROJECT VULCAN - TOP SECRET.\"  They walk through. \nINT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM \nInside, SCIENTISTS wearing head-to-toe radiation suits surround and inspect a huge diamond-encrusted drill bit. \nSCIENTIST This is the strongest, sharpest drill bit ever produced by man.  It weighs fifteen metric tones and can bore through a mile-thick bedrock of solid granite in seven seconds. \nINT.  VIRTUCON GIFT SHOP AREA - TOUR TRAM \nA SECURITY GUARD and the tour guide take a head count.  They notice Austin and Vanessa's empty seats on the tram.  The guard speaks into his walkie-talkie. \nINT.  PROJECT VULCAN RESEARCH ROOM \nSFX:  ALARM GOES OFF \nANNOUNCER (on PA) Attention, there are intruders in the complex. \nAll the radiation suited scientists turn to look at Austin and Vanessa. \nSCIENTIST Get them! \nThe scientist approach.  Austin knocks two of them out cold with judo chops. \nAUSTIN Judo chop!  Judo chop! \nVanessa knocks two of them out using roundhouse kicks. SECURITY GUARDS flood into the room from the hallway.  Austin and Vanessa take off through another side door which reads \"VIRTUCON \nSTEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY.\" \nINT.  STEAMROLLER TESTING FACILITY \nIt is a room the size of a large gymnasium overseen by a large observation booth.  Six STEAMROLLER go around a test track very slowly. \nAustin and Vanessa hide behind one of the slowly moving steamrollers.  Security guards enter the facility and begin fanning out in a search. \nAUSTIN Our only way out of here is to drive out! \nThey climb up the back of a steamroller, KNOCK OUT the DRIVER, push him off, and assume the controls. \nP.A. (O.S.) There they are! \nTwo SECURITY GUYS jump on either side of the steamroller. Vanessa wrestles the machine gun off on and pushes him away. Austin punches the other one off. \n", "test2_id": 724, "test3_input": "VANESSA I'll secure the perimeter. \nINT.  CONTROL AREA \nAustin enters the control area.  A VIRTUCON ARMY MAN fires at him.  Austin returns fires, shooting up some electrical equipment.  Live wires dangle dangerously.  Austin sees Mr. \nBigglesworth running out a read door. \nDR. EVIL (O.S.) Come, Mr. Bigglesworth! \nAustin heads for the door until he smacks into AN INVISIBLE FORCE FIELD.  He turns and sees a bank of old-fashioned computers labeled \"DESTRUCTACON 5000\". \nDESTRUCTACON (V.O.) Good afternoon, Mr. Powers, I'm the Destructacon 5000.  I'm programmed to prevent you from progressing beyond this point.  You might as well surrender.  Resistance is futile. Your odds of survival are 23,763,273 to \nAUSTIN Well, Destructacon 5000, you have quite a head on your shoulders, I dare to coin. \nDESTRUCTACON (V.O.) Yes, I am programmed to answer any question. \nAUSTIN Really?  Let me ask you this.  What is love? \nDESTRUCTACON (V.O.) That does not compute. \nAUSTIN Why not?  It's a question. \nDESTRUCTACON (V.O.) Love is...love is...love is... \nThe computers begin to smoke.  Alarm bells ring. \nDESTRUCTACON (V.O.) Remjack!  Remjack! (singing) Daisy, Daisy... (faster) Remjackremjackremjack! \nThere is a muffled explosion.  The computer goes dark.  Austin passes through the force field and heads for the door until he hears&emdash \nEASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (on PA) Subterranean detonation&emdash one minute and COUN-ting. \nHe begins looking furiously for the abort button. \nAUSTIN (to Eastern European Man) Where's the abort button? \nThe Eastern European Man holds up his finger as if to say 'give me one second.' \nEASTERN EUROPEAN MEAN (on PA) Forty-five seconds and COUN-ting. (to Austin) It's right over there. \nAustin sees the abort button.  It is across the room.  Just then, Random Task enters.  Austin sees him and goes to shoot him, but he has run out of bullets.  Random task takes off his SHOE. \nAustin makes his way across the room to the button. \nRandom Task THROWS HIS SHOE. \nANGLE ON SHOE SPINNING IN THE AIR \nThe shoe HITS AUSTIN IN THE HEAD.  Austin pauses.  The shoe has not killed him.  It has just hurt him slightly. \nAUSTIN Ow!  That really hurt.  I'm going to have a lump there, you idiot!  Who throws a shoe?  You fight like a woman. \nEASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (on PA) Fifteen seconds and COUN-ting. \nRandom task blocks Austin's way to the button.  He stands there, menacing, missing one shoe. \nExposed wires are everywhere.  On the counter beside Austin is a Big Gulp. \nAUSTIN Care for a drink? \nAustin throws the drink at Random Task's feet.  It lands in front of him on a pile of exposed wires.  Electricity travels through the Big Gulp, up Random Task's wet sock, ELECTROCUTING him. \nHe begins to SMOKE, and then dies. \nAUSTIN Shocking. \nEASTERN EUROPEAN MAN Three...two...one... \nA 50 kiloton explosion from deep in the earth rocks the control area. \nEXT.  STOCK FOOTAGE MONTAGE - VOLCANOS ERUPTING \n", "test3_true": "INT.  CONTROL AREA \nAustin dives in SLOW MOTION towards the abort button.  He flies through the air for an inordinate length of time. \nAUSTIN (slow motion distortion) Nooooooo! \nHis hand lands on the button. \nEASTERN EUROPEAN MAN (on PA) Abort. \nEXT.  STOCK FOOTAGE MONTAGE - REVERSE VOLCANO ERUPTIONS \nLava, smoke and debris sucks back into volcanoes around the world.  (Eruption footage run in reverse.) \nINT.  CONTROL ROOM \nHaving saved the world, Austin picks up a MACHIEN GUN from a fallen Private Army guy and runs to the door at the back, chasing Dr. Evil. \nINT.  CORRIDOR \nAustin chases after Dr. Evil. \nINT.  DR. EVIL'S PRIVATE QUARTERS \nAustin bursts in, catching Dr. Evil packing a suitcase. \nAUSTIN I've got you, Dr. Evil! \nDR. EVIL Well done, Mr. Powers.  We're not so different, you and I.  It's true, you're British, and I'm Belgian. You have a full head of hair, mine is slightly receding.  You're thin, I'm about forty pounds overweight. OK, we are different, I'm not making a very good point.  However, isn't it ironic, Mr. Powers, that the very things you stand for&emdash swinging, free love, parties, distrust of authority- are all now, in the Nineties, considered to \nbe...evil?  Maybe we have more in common than you care to admit. \nAUSTIN No, man, what we swingers were rebelling against were uptight squares like you, whose bag was money and world domination.  We were innocent, man.  If we'd known the consequences of our sexual liberation, we would have done things differently, but the spirit would have remained the same.  It's freedom, man. \nDR. EVIL Your freedom has cause more pain and suffering in the world than any plan I ever dreamed of.  Face it, freedom failed. \nAUSTIN That's why right now is a very groovy time, man.  We still have freedom, but we also have responsibility. \nDR. EVIL Really, there's nothing more pathetic than an aging hipster. \nAlotta enters.  She holds a gun to Vanessa's head. \nALOTTA Not so fast. \nDR. EVIL Well, it seems the tables have turned, Mr. Powers. \nJust then, Scott Evil enters. \nSCOTT EVIL Hey, Dad, I can take my Sega, right? \nAustin grabs Scott and puts the gun to his head. \nAUSTIN It seems the tables have turned again, Dr. Evil. \nDR. EVIL Not really.  Kill the little bastard. See what I care. \nAUSTIN Man, you are one chilly square! \nSCOTT EVIL Dad, we just made a breakthrough in group! \nDR. EVIL I had the group liquidated, you little shit.  They were insolent. \nSCOTT EVIL I hate you!  I hate you!  I wish I was never artificially created in a lab. \nDR. EVIL Scott, don't say that... \nScott runs off.  In the confusion, Vanessa KNOCKS the gun out of Alotta's hands.  Alotta pulls out a knife.  Austin SHOOTS the knife out of her hand.  Vanessa grabs Alotta by the throat. \nVANESSA This is for sleeping with my man, you whore! \nALOTTA I didn't sleep with him. \nVANESSA I don't believe you. \n", "test3_id": 725}

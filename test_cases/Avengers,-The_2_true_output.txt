Emma makes her way through the labyrinthine superstructure of the place, crawling high on a girder over some BURBLING LIQUID below.  She hears NOISE IN the DISTANCE.  Suddenly -- 
331     INT.  UNDERGROUND HQ - STEED - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Steed battles more guards!  No time to lose. 
Wham -- ! Bam -- ! Now moving with deadly earnest, Steed downs all oncomers, closing in on -- 
332     INT.  UNDERGROUND CONTROL ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION 
Steed rushes in, BOLTS the AIRLOCK behind.  Pounding on door. 
He sees the timer racing backwards -- stands over the controls, trying to figure out how to stop the program. 
Looks for the chip -- amongst all the rest it's like trying to find a contact lens in water. 
333     FLOOR-LEVEL HATCH 
opens behind.  Valentine emerges, drops the HATCH COVER with a THUD.  Steed whirls. 
VALENTINE John Steed. 
STEED Valentine Peel. I see you've gone back to using your original face. 
VALENTINE The last one you'll ever see. 
STEED Perish the thought. 
Valentine fulls forth a rapier from the wall. 
VALENTINE Did they tell you at Eton that I was fencing champion, too? 
Steed unsheathes his umbrella, revealing ditto. 
STEED They said you were a very naughty boy. 
The fight is on as the numbers grow smaller! 
334     SEVERAL ANGLES 
VALENTINE You're better than I expected. 
STEED I was at Harrow ... 
VALENTINE But did they teach you this? 
Valentine whacks the blade off Steed's umbrella handle.  Laughs.  A diminished phallic symbol.  Steed, dumbfounded. 
Valentine advances towards Steed -- 
Who points the umbrella at him. 
STEED Bang-bang ... you're dead. 
VALENTINE You wish. 
He moves to close in, when ... 
335     CLOSEUP - FLASH OF LIGHT 
from the muzzle, as a BULLET ZIPS out, and -- 
336     VALENTINE 
recoils.  Blood streams from his shoulder.  He looks up, devastated.  Steed blows smoke away from the muzzle. 
STEED One shot -- for emergencies. 
VALENTINE (clutches wound) That's not playing by the rules. 
STEED (echoes Emma!) Rules are made to be broken. 
VALENTINE (pulls his own gun) If you say so. 
STEED I do. 
He FIRES again.  To the heart.  Valentine spins to the floor. 
VALENTINE You said ... one shot. 
STEED Did I? My mistake. 
Steed turns to the console, tries to figure out how to stop the countdown, when behind the hatch opens again, revealing Emma.  Valentine pulls her up, grabs her as hostage -- 
VALENTINE I wouldn't do that, if I were you. 
Steed turns. 
STEED Mrs. Peel -- ! 
Valentine has Emma, a knife to her throat, stands over the hatch. 
VALENTINE Bullet-proof waistcoats -- just the thing. I get mine from Trubshaw's. We'll be off now, won't we, darling? (to Steed) We wouldn't want to miss the fireworks. Figure it out if you can, Steed ... 
337     DOWN HATCH 
Valentine drags Emma, bolting the hatch. 
338     ON STEED 
He's torn briefly, but there are thousands of lives at stake; Steed goes to the control module and starts pulling out chips, looking ...

The NEWLY CREATED DRILL BIT lowers into the drilling hole and begins turning. It  CHEWS into the shit down below, WHIRRING and RIPPING and......descends quickly. 
Chick It worked! She's goin' through her like a hot knife through butter! 
BEGIN MONTAGE 
The men drill a shitload of feet in very little time. It is a feverish pace,  their teamwork perfectly timed, as if choreographed. 
QUICK CUTS 
--A.J. working the levers on the drill platform. 
--Hydraulic tongs clamping, unclamping on pipe. 
--Bear hoisting pipe. 
--Chick and Bear waiting with connecting pipe. 
--The drilling arm going up and down. 
--Newly connected drill pipes descending into the hole. 
--Harry watching, shouting orders. 
--There are serious wind storms, giving Harry, A.J., and the other guys  problems. So severe they knock guys across the asteroid. 
END MONTAGE 
INT. MISSION CONTROL 
Skip looks at thermal readings with alarm. 
Skip Dan, the surface is heating up! 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
Harry Time, A.J. 
A.J. One hour. 
Harry Distance, Chick. 
Chick Eight hundred and twenty feet, Harry. 
Harry We gotta do 180 in thirty minutes. 
Chick Downhole pressure's goin' through the roof! 
Harry Stop! Shut down. 
Chick throws the lever. The drill pipe stops turning. 
A.J. Harry, we can't stop. 
Harry Got to, kid. No choice. 
A.J. Drill right through the pressure to pay dirt. 
Harry That's crazy. 
A.J. Sometimes crazy works. 
Harry and A.J. stare at each other. 
Harry Chick, A.J.'s callin' this one. 
A.J. Full throttle! 
Chick throws the lever. The DRILL PIPE descends on full throttle. 
INT. N.A.S.A. - MISSION CONTROL - DAY 
All the TECHNICIANS stand, staring at the CENTRAL BOARD, where a graph shows the  drilling progress. 
Flip Nine hundred and eighty...Nine ninety...they're into the fault, they're  doing it. 
Golden looks at the CLOCK. THIRTY-ONE MINUTES TO GO. He twists his wedding ring. 
Golden Now just get the thing in the hole. 
All the TECHNICIANS stare at their monitors. The atmosphere is thick with  tension. Clark chews his nails. 
EXT. ASTEROID SURFACE - DRILLING SITE 
The HOLE'S finished, the drill pipe's been pulled; A.J. drives the ARMADILLO  safely away from the site. 
Watts and Sharp roll a GURNEY containing the NUCLEAR DEVICE (a massive stainless  steel tube) down Freedom's cargo bay RAMP toward the hole. Harry and all the Roughnecks stand by the HOLE. 
Harry One thousand feet. 
Chick (smiles) Thousand and three, Harry. With a half hour to spare. 
Sharp and Watts roll the NUCLEAR DEVICE GURNEY past the Roughnecks up to the  drilling hole. 
Harry Get the pipe and bit outta there. 
Chick gets inside the Armadillo. Grabs the stick-shift. Compresses the clutch  and throws it in reverse.

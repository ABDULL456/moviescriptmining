PLEXOR.   Flanked by his four snarling Cybavor beasts. 
PLEXOR Flynn. Your moment of obsolescence is upon you. 
Across the moat, Rush and Mega climb to the entry point. 
Flynn plays for time, stalling Plexor so he doesn't catch sight of them. 
FLYNN Freedom, Plexor. It's the better idea. That's why Mega chose my side. 
PLEXOR If an idea is erased from all memory banks, it can be neither good nor bad. When each alternative has been removed, X-Net will simply BE. 
With a hand signal, he commands his Cybavors.         They raise up, poised to attack Flynn. 
FLYNN Crash me. Hack me. Do what you want. The yearning for freedom will last forever. 
PLEXOR Nice speech... USER! 
He flicks a finger.       Cybavors gallop at Flynn. 
130   EXT.   MAIN POWER SUPPLY CORE - LEDGE 
Rush and Mega gain footing at the entry point.      They turn at the sound of DIGITAL SNARLING. 
Across the moat, a gut-wrenching sight: 
All four Cybavors pounce on Flynn, hurling him off the ledge, mauling him as they go down, dividing into eight - Plummeting toward the MOLTEN DATA far below. 
Plexor steps out of his corridor, relishing the view:      Remains of fallen bodies FLASH into the inferno. 
MEGA Noooooo!!! 
Plexor sees Mega and Rush on the other side. 
PLEXOR Over there!    Surround them! 
Bridges instantly extend from outer square to CORE CUBE. 
X-Takks stream across, firing - 
131   INT.   POWER SUPPLY CORE CUBE 
Rush and Mega duck inside entry point, pelted by disks. 
Before them: A vast, brilliant, energized LATTICE. Power surges in rings, drawing down huge columns. Every piece of geometry is based on perfect squares, made of mirror-finished rare earth elements. 
Rush pulls the HOLOGON KEY into view. Facets resonate with energy patterns like those in the core. 
RUSH We plug this into the control cell, X-Net is history. 
MEGA Let's do it for Flynn. 
They share a heartbeat of solidarity.      Rivalry gone. 
X-Takks stream in, firing. 
Rush and Mega charge the center, throwing disks, fighting back-to-back. 
(CONTINUED) 
131   CONTINUED: 
Problem is, ENERGY RINGS move continuously down the columns - and the columns are spaced close - leaving just enough time between ring-passes to jump through. 
RUSH NOW! 
He and Mega JUMP, nearly raked by down-flowing ENERGY RINGS. 
X-Takks fire NEGABYTE BLASTERS - but many of the beams are caught in the energy flow and sucked away. That's how intense this place is. 
X-Takk Soldier is grazed, stumbles into ENERGY COLUMN. RING rakes down and ZAPS him nasty - reducing him to bits, sucking his energy to the levels below. 
Rush and Mega encounter oncoming X-Takks - they must split up. They fling disks, taking out X-Takks, dodging fire - working their way deeper. 
Meg and Rush throw their disks simultaneously.     Both disks score hits, then arc to return. 
Rush and Mega catch each other's disk. They each look at the strange disks - it's just not the same. The do a quick swap and keep fighting. 
MEGA Over there! 
The CONTROL CELL.    Dead center. 
132   INT.   CONTROL CELL CHAMBER 
Rush and Mega battle off three X-Takks - the way is clear. 
Rush leaps, crashes planes of silicon.     Stows his disk, pulls out the HOLOGON. 
Spots the control cell's key receptacle - SHAPES MATCH. 
Rush moves to insert the hologon. 
A DISK STRIKES his arm - HOLOGON flies wild. 
RUSH AAARRGGGHHH! 
PLEXOR drops from above, riding an OPTIK SHAFT. 
PLEXOR Where did you get that?!   No one knows this code but me!

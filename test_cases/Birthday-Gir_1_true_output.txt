EXT. AIRPORT - NIGHT 
The front of the terminal. Taxis pull up and idle at a rank, bringing travelers to their flights. The automatic doors slide back and forth. 
INT. AIRPORT CHECKING IN DESK - NIGHT 
ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.) Last Call for Aeroflot flight 1311 to Moscow. Proceed immediately to Gate 12. 
John carries the guitar cases full of money. Nadia just has her small camouflaged hold all. They walk quickly together in silence and come to a stop at the departure lounge gate 
JOHN Are you okay? 
She nods. 
JOHN Okay. Goodbye. 
NADIA Goodbye. 
They shake. 
JOHN What will you do now? 
Nadia shrugs. 
NADIA Something else. 
JOHN Okay. Promise? 
She looks at him. 
NADIA Promise. 
They stand around. She takes the last cigarette from a pack. 
JOHN You can probably buy them on the flight. 
NADIA I'm quitting. This will be my last one. So. Goodbye. 
JOHN Goodbye. 
NADIA You didn't deserve me John Buckingham. 
JOHN Whatever. 
NADIA I'm sorry. 
JOHN Please. 
Pause. 
NADIA You prefer your women... 
She seems about to say something more when the tannoy interrupts. 
ANNOUNCEMENT (V.O.) Gate closing for Flight 1311 to Moscow. Please have your tickets ready. 
She leans forward and kisses him. As they kiss, John puts a guitar case in her hand. Nadia looks down at the case. 
NADIA It's not mine. 
JOHN It's not mine either. 
NADIA It's what you came back for. 
John frowns and looks a little embarrassed. 
She speaks to him in Russian and we see the subtitles. 
NADIA (in Russian) You're a big surprise, you know.

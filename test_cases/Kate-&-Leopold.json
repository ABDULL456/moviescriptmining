{"train": "\"KATE AND LEOPOLD\" \nScreenplay by \nJames Mangold and Steven Rogers \nBased on a story by \nSteven Rogers \nFADE IN: \nINT. VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY \nCLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15. \nThe credits begin to roll. \nCalligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in preparation for a formal reception. \nServants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier. \nHands rapidly shine silver cutlery. \nFresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nKitchen clock strikes 2:15. \nPoultry plucked. Feathers everywhere. \nSteaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with decorative garnish. \nExtravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey, pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering, sour look. \nThe valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nAntique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt. \nThe dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK. \nFlinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit. \nEXT. ESTATE - DAY \nThe riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon, he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path. \nIn the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows. \nINT. HALLWAY - EVENING \nLarge hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling the staff to clean up the mess. \nSERIES OF CLOSE UPS \nGaudily framed portraits of somber relations. \nA bird sits listless in a gilded cage. \nHot water is poured into a bath. \nCarriages begin to arrive. \nOrchestra leader signals the musicians to play. \nGuests fill the ballroom in formal attire. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLeopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror. \nHe wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens a corset around his mid-section from behind. \nLeopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored. \nHe turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry. \nHe affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror. \nFinally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror. \nHe spots a VERY LOVELY WOMAN hidden amongst the guests. She scribbles in a small note pad, occasionally glancing around. Hiding his dance card, he saunters over. \nLEOPOLD Good evening. I do not believe I have had the pleasure. \nThe young woman stares vacantly at Leopold until she realizes he is addressing her. She puts her pad away. \nCARLSON ...Julia Carlson. \nLeopold takes her hand and kisses it gently. \nCARLSON I'm sorry. Will you excuse me? \nLEOPOLD (slightly tipsy) You are not from the area, are you? \nCARLSON (smiles and shakes her head \"No\") Are you? \nLEOPOLD This is my estate. \nCARLSON Really? (looking around the room) Well it's not home but it's much... \nLeopold regards her curiously. The orchestra starts up. There is a hubbub amongst the guests. \nLEOPOLD Shocking! The TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY. \nCARLSON The? Oh, that's from Paris, isn't it? \nLEOPOLD It is a scandal nonetheless. \nLeopold spots Uncle Otto observing him from across the room. \nLEOPOLD Miss Carlson, do me the honor? \nCARLSON I'm afraid I'm not much of a dancer. \nLEOPOLD (smiling seductively) Truly I would be in your debt. Any admonition would be erased simply by presenting a partner as lovely as yourself. \nCARLSON No, no. Really, I... \nLeopold stiffly holds out his arm. A beat. Carlson, stuck, takes it WITH HESITATION and is escorted to the dance floor. \nThey dance. ALL but Leopold and Carlson gaily sing \"TA-RA-RA- BOOM-DE-AY.\" Leopold, flushed, looks quite smitten. Carlson, shy at first, eventually smiles brightly. \nLEOPOLD I suppose we really ought to sing along. \nCARLSON (embarrassed) Oh, golly. \nThey half sing, half speak the TA-RA-RA-BOOM-DE-AY, their emphasis on \"BOOM.\" Laughing giddily, their dancing becomes freer, picking up speed. The room SPINS. Finally: \nCARLSON (breathless) Thank you for the dance. It was lovely. I hope it wasn't too awful for you. \nLEOPOLD Not at all. It was most enlightening. \nThere is a slight pause. The Grandfather CLOCK strikes midnight. \nCARLSON I really must be going. \nLEOPOLD I won't hear of it. \nCARLSON (moving away from him) No, I'm quite late as it is. \nLEOPOLD I shall see you to the door... \nCARLSON (stopping him resolutely) You're very sweet. I had a wonderful time. (she watches him, memorizing his face. Then firmly) Goodbye. \nLeopold takes a glass of champagne from a passing waiter. He watches Carlson pass through the crowd and out the courtyard door. He surveys the room. After a moment he follows her. \nEXT. GARDEN - NIGHT \nLeopold makes his way through the manicured garden in the dark. He hears an EERIE METALLIC SOUND. He slows down, brushes back the thicket. The silhouette of a woman is revealed. She is once again writing in her notebook. \nLEOPOLD Miss Carlson? \nCarlson spins around quickly, panicked. Leopold STOPS. Partially hidden in the brush, a sleek, oddly shaped, MECHANICAL device. It's door open, lit from within, casting a weird glow. \nLEOPOLD Good God... \nCARLSON What are you...? You frightened me. \nLeopold moves toward the contraption and is about to touch it... \nLEOPOLD What sort of mechanism is this? \nCarlson shakes her head, unsure of how to proceed. \nKATE ...say... Goodbye. \nDr. Plodder bursts in. Kate sees his distress and instantly becomes very centered. \nDR. PLODDER She's back. \nKATE (rising) That's impossible! She wasn't supposed to return until... \nDR. PLODDER Kate. It's Carlson. Something went wrong. \nHe hands her Carlson's note pad. Slowly, she sits down. \nKATE ...The 7th Duke... \nINT. LAB - DAY \nKATE (all business, reading from a printout) ...of Albany. He was the... IS the son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no actual importance until he vanished at the turn of the century without a trace. It was a sensation. In the 30's they even made a movie about him. \"The Tenuous Duke\" with Ronald Coleman. \nDR. DRAKE (absently) I love Ronald Coleman. \nKATE Despite much speculation and a nation wide investigation, a body was never found. He was never heard from again. \nDR. KAU Until now. \nThere is a stunned silence. They stare at Leopold in awe. \nDR. DRAKE We've altered the course of history. \nDR. KAU We never should have started this... \nKATE Calm down. \nDR. PLODDER What are we going to do? We can't keep him here. Imagine if anyone found out! \nKATE Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now, no one would believe such a stupid mistake could be made because no one would believe any of this is possible. So. We fix this. We keep this to ourselves and we fix it. Fast. \nThey all nod in agreement. \nKATE Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st priority: Locate Carlson. Drake, determine the reciprocal correlation's connected to the 19th century. Work 24 hours a day if necessary. In the meantime... one of us will have to take charge of him. \nShe forces back panic. Only the tremor in her voice gives her away. \nKATE This is a major scientific opportunity. It doesn't get any better than this. Imagine. Researching the behavior, the physical and emotional characteristics of a century ago! Utilizing technology available to us today... He's a gold mine! \nDR. PLODDER He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig. \nKATE And while he's here, he's ours. Any volunteers? \nNo one moves. \nDR. DRAKE We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked will be responsible. Agreed? \nThey nod reluctantly. Drake writes out names and throws them in a cup. The silence becomes deafening. Finally: \nDR. KAU I'll do it. \nAll the scientists face her. \nDR. PLODDER You'll look after him? \nDR. KAU No, I meant I'll pick the name. \nShe reaches in. They wait with mounting suspense. Finally SHE TURNS TO KATE. The scientists follow her gaze. A beat. \nKATE Fine. \nLeopold stirs. He blinks at the group. \nLEOPOLD Where...? What has happened?! \nThe doctors, caught off guard, SMILE BENIGNLY. They surround Leopold as a group, not knowing where to begin. Finally: \nKATE Your Grace... Um... Hello... Weee aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge research team. A project funded by the government of the United States. \nLEOPOLD (regarding their appearance with distaste) Oh. Americans. I see... \nKATE Yes, um... For the past six and a half years we've been conducting scientific experiments on density and flexibility in the dimensions of time and space. \nDR. DRAKE Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came upon a formula utilizing Tachyons... particles traveling faster than the speed of light, which allowed us to... fold time so to speak. \nDR. PLODDER Yes. Bend it between the cracks of the dimensions. \nDR. KAU Yes. \nKATE You're going to be fine you know. There's nothing to worry about. I have everything under control. \nDr. Kau stares at Kate in concerned silence. \nKATE (quietly to Dr. Kau) We'll never get away with this. \nINT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING \nLeopold awakens alone in his room. He sits up with a jolt. His stomach sinks as he realizes THIS IS NO DREAM. He slowly rises to his full stature, moving to the window he looks out on the modern day city, shaking his head in awe. He makes his way to the bedroom door and tentatively touches the knob. \nThere is a KNOCK on the door. \nLeopold JUMPS back and runs to the bed: The picture of dignity. \nKATE How are you feeling? (no response) I thought you might like some tea. \nLEOPOLD I insist on being returned home immediately. \nKATE I understand. We're doing our best. \nLEOPOLD I wish to speak with your employer, Dr. Coles. \nKATE You're speaking to him. \nLEOPOLD You are not suggesting that you are Dr. Coles? \nShe smiles. \nLEOPOLD Miss... uh? \nKATE Dr. Coles. If you like, you could call me Miss Dr. Coles or if that's too much, how about just plain Kate? \nLEOPOLD (coldly) A WOMAN of science? \nKATE Hard to believe? \nLEOPOLD But a woman's brain cannot obtain enough knowledge to posses a truly scientific mind. \nKATE (jotting this down) Interesting. Nevertheless, we've come a long way baby. \nLEOPOLD (confused) Are you attempting to be humorous? \nKATE I'm attempting to be informative it's just coming out humorous. \nLeopold regards her dubiously. \nKATE (clinically) Look, modern social science clearly states that a woman's place in society marks the level of that civilization. A science career for a woman is now almost as acceptable as being a... a... waitress. Cream and sugar? \nLEOPOLD Young lady, I... Surely it is not expected that I remain here with you indefinitely... Unchaperoned? \nKATE (pen poised) Does that make you nervous? \nLEOPOLD Certainly not! \nKATE (writing) Then what are you getting so red about? It's a very large apartment... with locks on all the doors. \nLEOPOLD The idea! My dear Miss Coles... \nKATE Dr. Coles. \nLEOPOLD Honey... \nKATE (she puts the pad down) Let's get one thing straight right now. My name is Kate or Katherine or if you insist Dr. Coles. (she rises) Take a good long look, Leopold. I am a 20th century American woman with a Doctorate and a commission and independence. I am not your \"young lady\" or your \"pretty Miss\" or your \"honey.\" Is that clear? \nLeopold watches her with great interest. Finally: \nLEOPOLD Honey... For the tea. \nKATE ...I'll get it for you. \nKate grabs the teacup grandly and leaves the room. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nKate rummages through every drawer, shelf and cupboard searching for the honey. Finally, she spots the honeybear and squeezes honey A TAD TO VIOLENTLY into the tea. She tries posing \"confidently\" then checks her reflection in the toaster. \nINT. BEDROOM - MORNING \nKate returns \"confidently\" with the tea and a plastic smile. \nLEOPOLD Thank you... Has it been decided what it is I am to do while I am being held here? \nKATE Oh, just some laundry, the cooking, a little light housework... \nCHARLIE What about a hotel? \nKATE This man requires around the clock attention. \nCHARLIE I meant for me. \nKATE Thank you, Charlie. (she kisses his forehead) I owe you one. \nCHARLIE You owe me nine. What am I supposed to do all day? \nKATE (as if having an epiphany) You could get a job! \nCHARLIE Kate, the entire point of being an artist is that I don't have to work. Who is this guy? \nKATE Well, I can't tell you much because... \nKATE AND CHARLIE I'm not allowed to discuss what goes on at the office. \nKATE Well I'm not. Anyway, it might be interesting to have someone else to talk to. It gets so quiet around here sometimes I feel like I've gone deaf. \nCHARLIE Does he have a label? \nKATE Leopold. \nCHARLIE LEOPOLD? Is he anything like his name? \nKATE He's exactly like his name. \nCHARLIE Then you owe me ten. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nLeopold PEEKS around the entrance to the living room. Confident it's unoccupied, he majestically walks inside: Up to date gadgetry, Charlie's modern art work, bright fashionable furniture. Leopold recoils. His eyes come to rest on the television set. The ON OFF buttons loom large. He looks around the room then brazenly presses the button ON. \nInstantly, REGIS and KATHY LEE loudly berate each other before an excited crowd. \nLeopold jumps back several feet, hands flailing in front of him as if shooing away a bee. He quickly, yet cautiously, slams the power OFF. \nLEOPOLD Horrible! \nHe quickly scurries out the hallway. \nHe stops abruptly. He remains very still. Composing himself, he turns and deliberately faces the room. After a moment, he purposefully steps back inside. \nHe makes a large ARC around the television set, is confronted by one of Charlie's sculptures and makes an ARC around that. He finds himself in front of a light switch and gingerly examines it. As he does, track lighting ILLUMINATES the room. \nHe looks at the lights then back at the switch. He flicks the lights ON and OFF, trying to figure out the precise moment in the transfer of power, laughing in spite of himself. \nKate and Charlie enter. They watch Leopold flicking the lights, laughing like a madman. Charlie gives Kate a look. \nKATE (explaining) He's from Canada... \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nLeopold sits at the head of the table, Kate and Charlie banished to either side. Leopold chews his dinner incessantly. \nLEOPOLD (finally) What is this? \nKATE It's called Hamburger Helper. \nLEOPOLD It is beyond help. Please serve the next course. \nHe pushes his plate away. \nKATE I'm afraid there is no next course. If you make a list of the foods you like, I'll pick them up at the store for you. \nLEOPOLD Is all food here this... textured? \nCHARLIE Mine's good. \nLEOPOLD Please understand, I am used to a different sort of preparation. Where I come from a proper meal is the result of reflection and study. A recipe is merely a theme which an intelligent cook can plan each time with variation. \nCharlie gives Kate a look. \nLEOPOLD Several courses are served. Menus are often prepared days in advance, timed to perfection. It is said, without the culinary art, the crudeness of reality would make life unbearable. \nCHARLIE In Canada? \nLEOPOLD (after a beat. Firmly) In Canada. \nCHARLIE We have a saying here. \"Shake and shake the catsup bottle, none will come and then a lot'll.\" \nHe pours catsup on his dinner. \nLEOPOLD We'd better get to bed... That is... \nKATE Yes... I start work... (she looks at her watch) in three and a half hours. \nLEOPOLD Oh, dear. \nThey self-consciously head to their respective rooms. \nKATE It's fine. I'm used to it. \nLEOPOLD You mustn't get too used to it. You'll find life passes you by awfully quickly. \nKate is struck by his vulnerability for the first time and is moved. She catches herself quickly however. \nLEOPOLD Thank you for... \nKATE (waving it away) Oh! \nThey stand at their bedroom doors. \nLEOPOLD Well, goodnight then. \nKATE Leopold?... I don't have a clear handle on this. Perhaps I was wrong keeping you confined to the apartment all this time. I don't know when you'll be able return home... Tomorrow I'll start preparing you for the outside world. And... We'll find your way back. I promise. \nLeopold smiles, still shaken. A beat. They slowly close the doors to their respective rooms. \nINT. HALLWAY - BRIGHT SUNNY MORNING \nLeopold, dressed for an outing knocks on Kate's bedroom door. \nKATE (V.O.) Yes? \nLeopold enters. Kate stands in a slip calmly looking at Leopold. Leopold immediately turns, facing the door. \nLEOPOLD Oh! I beg your pardon. I, I, I, was merely... I didn't... \nKATE Is there something you want, Leopold? \nLEOPOLD I merely wanted to see... that is, inquire, on your availability, for an outing... My assimilation and so forth. \nKATE Yes, we have a lot of work ahead of us. I'll be out in a minute. \nLEOPOLD Yes, of course. Splendid. \nHe reaches around behind his back and fumbles for the knob. He finally finds it and goes out. \nKate smiles. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. N.Y.C. - DAY \nthe Brooklyn Bridge, the Chrysler Building, Rockefeller Center, 5th Avenue. \nEXT. 5TH AVENUE - DAY \nKate and Leopold exit The Gap. Leopold awkwardly wears hip Gap casual clothes, a baseball cap on his head. \nLEOPOLD Are you certain this is correct? \nKate places the cap backwards on his head. She nods approvingly. \nKATE Certainly I'm certain. \nLeopold watches himself in store windows. He CAN'T comprehend it. Kate leads him into Barney's. \nINT. BARNEY'S - DAY \nLeopold stands before the mirror wearing a classic dark suit. He looks FANTASTIC. A fact that is not lost on Kate. \nLEOPOLD Now really. Isn't this better? \nKate nods back begrudgingly, her breath taken away. \nEXT. N.Y.C. - DAY \nLincoln Center, Columbus Circle, Gristedes. \nINT. GRISTEDES MARKET - DAY \nKate selects a shopping cart, begins to push it. \nLEOPOLD Allow me. \nSALESLADY (giving Kate the once over) Yep. \nKATE (staring down at her clothes then back at the two of them) What?... What? \nINT. ROBERTA'S - DAY \nFrom behind the dressing room door, Kate shouts to the others with irritation. \nKATE This is ridiculous. I don't have time to... (she shrieks) Do you know what this dress costs? Let's get this over with. I'm coming out. Nobody laugh. \nKate leaves the dressing room in a huff COMPLETELY UNAWARE that she is STUNNING. \nKATE Satisfied? \nLeopold and the saleslady stare at her with pleasure. \nKATE ...What? \nShe turns and looks at herself in the mirror. Leopold stands behind her, pulls back her hair, brushes away her bangs. \nLEOPOLD You have a lovely face. \nEven Kate cannot deny that she is lovely. She stares at herself for a long while. \nLEOPOLD (quietly) We'll take the dress. \nThey become aware of their close proximity. They nervously part. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - LATE AFTERNOON \nKate sits Leopold down on the sofa. She turns on the TV and hands him the remote control. \nLEOPOLD What is this? \nKATE The drug of the 20th century. \nShe aims the remote at the TV, changing channels. He's spellbound. \nINT. DINING ROOM - EARLY EVENING \nDinner is served. Kate waits patiently for Leopold who sits on the sofa watching the TV. \nKATE Leopold, your dinner's getting cold. \nLEOPOLD I'm coming. \nHe does not move a muscle. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nKate and Leopold sit on the sofa eating their dinner and watching TV. On the screen, a Looney Tune. Leopold enjoys this especially. Kate reaches for the remote but Leopold grabs it territorially, refusing to relinquish it. \nKATE (making notes) It's a guy thing. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nLeopold asleep on the sofa still clutching the remote control. Kate comes in with a blanket and settles it over Leopold. She glances around the room, then slowly bends down close to capture a better look at his face. \nAfter a moment she catches herself, takes herself in hand and sits down at her computer. She opens her notes and types. Her fingers slow down to a crawl and come to a stop. She looks up at Leopold lost in thought. She smiles. \nReaching for a soda, she accidentally knocks a picture to the floor. In a SMASHED frame, Kate and CARLSON drunkenly mug for the camera. Kate pales noticeably. \nShe looks from the picture to Leopold. Slowly, she begins pecking away at the keys. She does not look up again. \nINT. LAB - LATE AFTERNOON \nKate gives Leopold a tour of the lab stopping by Dr. Drakes area. Hidden behind chalk boards, calculator paper, and several empty Haagen Dazs containers, Dr. Drake searches for solutions. \nKATE ...Now within that astronomical structure, Dr. Drake here is searching for a pathway between your time and the present. He'll find it too if his arteries don't harden first. \nLEOPOLD Astounding. \nKATE Once that is discovered, the search begins for the exact time and date travel will be possible. \nThey move to Dr. Kau's area. \nLEOPOLD (to Dr. Kau) How are you proceeding? \nDr. Kau merely grunts. Leopold looks at Kate. \nKATE Don't take it personally. Once Dr. Kau starts working, you just have to wait until her batteries run down. We're all pretty much like that. \nThey head into Kate's office. \nThe men take their places on the dance floor. They flick their hand twice, inviting their women to dance. Cooly, elegantly, the women approach their partners. After a while Kate looks up, relieved. She stands alone. Ballroom music plays. \nThe couples effortlessly shift between steps and turns. Kate dances with an imaginary partner, stumbling, more than a beat behind, counting, animated, a concentrated YEARNING look spread across her face. \nThe instructor approaches with a look of resignation. \nINSTRUCTOR Don't think so much, Katie. FEEL the music. \nKATE (sweating) I am! \nINSTRUCTOR Dancing should not be work. It should be a vacation the body takes from the mind. Let the music wash over you. \nKATE (frustrated) It is! \nINSTRUCTOR Repeat after me: I've got the muusic in me. \nKATE I've got the muusic in me. \nINSTRUCTOR & KATE (overlapping) I've got the muusic in me! \nINSTRUCTOR Keep telling yourself that. \nKate does. Her instructor shakes her head and moves away. \nAcross the room, through the window, Leopold watches, moved. \nLEOPOLD'S P.O.V. -- Over the music, beyond the swirling couples, Kate remains in the corner, dancing with her imaginary partner, fighting valiantly for the right steps, muttering to herself, dancing alone. \nINT. LAB - MORNING \nDr. Kau SLAMS a large book on Dr. Plodder's desk startling him. \nDR. KAU I've located her. \nDR. PLODDER You didn't! Is she all right? \nDR. KAU No. She's really not. \nPhotograph of a SWEATSHOP 1896. The conditions are APPALLING. Positioned among the workers, Julia Carlson, thin, ragged, worn out, stares helplessly into the camera. \nDR. KAU It was taken a year after she arrived. Look at her face! We have to get her back. \nDR. PLODDER Christine, this morning I spoke with the head of funding. They're talking about canceling the project. \nDR. KAU What?! They can't do that! \nDR. PLODDER There's still time. Nothing has happened yet that can't be undone. We'll get her back. We'll put this behind us and we'll get her back. \nThe doctors stare at the photograph. Powerless. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - DAY \nCharlie and Leopold work at their easels. Leopold sighs HEAVILY. \nCHARLIE Is there something on your mind? \nThere is a pause. \nLEOPOLD This is rather difficult for me. \nCHARLIE ...Uh huh...? \nLEOPOLD I have been in the salon contemplating the reception I have received by the various tradesmen I have visited. I've determined I am lacking the dexterity of modern intercourse. \nCHARLIE Of what?? \nLEOPOLD Social skills. \nCHARLIE Oh. \nLEOPOLD I realize our association has been rather distant and I bear you no ill will. \nCHARLIE You can imagine my relief. \nLEOPOLD The fact is... I need help. \nCHARLIE Why not ask Kate? \nLEOPOLD I would appreciate the masculine point of view. \nCHARLIE Why not ask Kate?... That was a joke. \nWOMAN She's another Babe Ruth. We had no idea. Are you okay? \nLeopold regards them curiously. \nWOMAN What do you have to say for yourself, Elizabeth? \nELIZABETH I'm sorry! \nLeopold stares hard at the modern familial scene. He doesn't speak. After a long moment: \nLEOPOLD Is this your child? \nMAN Yes. \nCharlie braces for the worst. The little girl stares at Leopold. \nLEOPOLD I see. \nWOMAN C'mon honey, lets go. \nELIZABETH I want my ball. \nLEOPOLD Just a moment! (bending down to Elizabeth, firmly) Pick a hand. \nShe picks his right hand. Nothing. She picks his left. Nothing. Leopold looks surprised then pulls the ball from his ear. She takes the ball and smiles at him. \nLEOPOLD My mother's name was Elizabeth. (then to her parents) She's a beautiful child. You're very lucky. \nMAN What do you say, Elizabeth? \nElizabeth makes an embarrassed face. \nMAN Thank you. \nCharlie and Leopold continue through the park, Leopold lost in thought. Charlie watches him in surprise. They walk on. \nINT. DINING ROOM - NIGHT \nLeopold talks animatedly. On the table -- Pumpkin pies, pizza pies, and pot pies. \nLEOPOLD I understand pumpkin pies, pizza pies, and pot pies. But I wish someone would explain Eskimo pies. \nHe eats a large spoonful of pudding. Kate and Charlie exchange a worried look. \nLEOPOLD You smoke Camel's, you wear Old Spices, and you drink Mountains Dew. It's revolting. (to Kate) The pudding tonight is excellent. Another thing I've noticed, everyone is in a great rush today. Instant Oatmeal, Instant Coffee, Speed Stick, Minute Maid. You'll find there's much to be said for moderation and languor. \nHe eats another spoonful. \nLEOPOLD Mmmm. Is it tapioca? \nKATE It's margarine. \nLEOPOLD (taking the spoon out of his mouth) It's marvelous. \nCHARLIE Well, I'm off. \nKATE Me too. Work to do. Where are you going? \nCHARLIE I'm meeting everyone over at Caffeine. It's this coffee house we go to. \nKATE Say hello to Dennis for me. \nLEOPOLD Who is that? \nCHARLIE Dennis is this really good looking friend of mine who doesn't know Kate's alive because SHE doesn't know how to flirt. \nKATE As a rule I don't like to associate with really good looking people. It makes me feel really... I don't know... Smart. But Dennis is a nice guy. \nCHARLIE And he always picks up the check. \nLEOPOLD Sounds enjoyable. I shall join you. \nCHARLIE What? \nKATE That's a wonderful idea! Leopold mentioned how he wanted to meet... People of quality was it? \nCHARLIE Ahhhhh? \nLEOPOLD If you'd rather I didn't go... \nKATE Nonsense! Charlie, you don't want to hurt Leopold's feelings. He's going to think you don't want him to go. \nCHARLIE Oh it's not that. It's just that it's sort of a vulgar crowd, is all. I'm not sure you'd have such a good time. \nLEOPOLD You did not tell the truth about Patrice, Charles. \nDENNIS AND BILL CHARLES?? \nCHARLIE What did I tell you, LEO? \nLEOPOLD He informed me you were inconceivably HOT, but I think you're lovely. Exceptionally lovely. \nPATRICE Thank you, Leo. \nCHARLIE (to the waitress) Check please. \nINT. SUBWAY - NIGHT \nThe subway car is inhabited solely by Leopold, Charlie, and the oldest Ukrainian woman in New York City. Despite the fact that the train is empty, they are all seated on the same bench. \nCharlie stares straight ahead refusing to even look at Leopold. The Ukrainian woman hangs on every word. \nCHARLIE Just drop it Leopold. \nLEOPOLD But Charles, it is so ridiculous. I am not interested in her. \nCHARLIE Hah! \nLEOPOLD In any case the problem is not with me but with you. (quietly) You have no idea what it takes to go about courting a woman. From what I've witnessed tonight, it is symptomatic of your entire generation. \nCHARLIE (almost speechless) You are some piece of work, Leopold. \nLEOPOLD Now I do not wish to get personal... \nCharlie bursts into ironic laughter and looks at the old woman. She rolls her eyes. \nLEOPOLD But you have been of great assistance to me and I feel this is one area where I can be of some real help. \nCHARLIE I'm fascinated. Go on. \nLEOPOLD Now, why was I successful with this young lady and why did you so miserably fail? \nCHARLIE What makes you think she likes you? \nLEOPOLD Well she gave me the number of her telephone and I assumed it meant... \nCHARLIE Go on. \nLEOPOLD As I see it, the girl hasn't an inkling of your intentions. And it's no wonder. You, Charles, are a Merry Andrew. \nCHARLIE A what? \nLEOPOLD A Merry Andrew. \nCHARLIE I am not!! \nLEOPOLD Everything plays like a farce to you. The more wit, the less courage. I believe the modern woman desires passion, protection, sensitivity. No woman wants to be romanced by a buffoon. (the old woman shakes her head) Banter and repartee are fine but you must add to that a different sort of playfulness. \nCHARLIE You think I should pounce? \nLEOPOLD I'm saying you must treat her with respect. Any oaf can attempt a crude pass. A woman of Kate's stature would never respond to an artificial tactic. \nCHARLIE Kate? \nLEOPOLD What? \nCHARLIE You said Kate. \nLEOPOLD I did not. \nCHARLIE Yes you did. Didn't he say Kate? \nThe old woman nods. \nLEOPOLD We are discussing your problem. \nCHARLIE Not anymore. You like my sister. \nLEOPOLD Charles... \nCHARLIE She has trouble with men, you know. \nLEOPOLD Perhaps she has not met the right one. \nCHARLIE She has met the right one. HUNDREDS of times. But she pulls back. She cuts herself off. You turn around and suddenly you're dating a Sphinx. \nLEOPOLD One never can tell. \nPATRICE It's beautiful. \nCharlie quickly looks at Leopold pleadingly. He really does not want to say this next part. Leopold, however, is adamant. \nCHARLIE (deadpan) Gracing me with your conversation and company would mean the world to me. \nThere is a long pause. Patrice watches Charlie in disbelief. \nPATRICE Um... 7:00? \nCHARLIE 7:00 is fine. I'll call for you then. \nThey smile at each other for a long moment. \nLEOPOLD (silently mouthing) Goodbye. \nCHARLIE Goodbye. (she closes the door) It worked! \nLEOPOLD Of course it did. \nCHARLIE Leopold, I... I'm... I have no idea what to do next! \nLEOPOLD Charles. Leave everything to me. \nCHARLIE Not so fast, buddy. You're next. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nKate is by the bookshelf gathering reference books on time and space. Leopold enters. He is suddenly embarrassed and doesn't know how to proceed. \nLEOPOLD Good morning. \nKATE Good morning. You're up early. \nShe moves to her computer on the other side of the room. Leopold follows. Before she can sit down, Leopold pulls out her chair. She falls to the ground. He rushes to her side immediately. \nLEOPOLD I'm terribly sorry!! \nKATE Happens all the time... \nShe opens a reference book and slowly begins typing at her computer. There is a pause. \nLEOPOLD Dr. Coles?... ah, Kate? I was wondering... \nShe stops working and looks at Leopold. \nLEOPOLD What it is you're working on. \nKATE Oh. It's my computer. \nShe resumes her work. \nLEOPOLD I see. Actually I meant the work itself. \nKATE I'm researching the correlations between your time and the present. \nLeopold stares blankly. \nKATE I'm TRYING to get you home, Leopold. \nLEOPOLD Oh. \nCharlie peaks in, signaling Leopold, spurring him on. \nLEOPOLD I have never seen a woman work as diligently and extensively before. \nKATE It's made me the man I am today. \nLEOPOLD It's quite a beautiful day, have you noticed? Perhaps you would permit yourself some time off and grant me the privilege of escorting you around the city this fine Spring afternoon. \nKATE Oh, I'd love to but I can't. I've got too much work to do. Ask Charlie though. He'll go with you. \nLEOPOLD I'm afraid it really wouldn't be the same. It is YOUR company I am seeking. \nSurprised, Kate turns around and looks at Leopold. \nKATE (gently) Oh, Leopold. I'm so sorry. I can't. \nLEOPOLD I see. Some other time then. \nKATE Yes... Thank you. \nLeopold sits at the far end of the room. Kate takes a moment then resumes typing. She STOPS and sits back in her chair. After a long moment, she subtly unplugs the computer with her foot and starts banging on the top of it. \nThey collapse on the couch. \nLEOPOLD Ah, JFK, PDQ, XYZ. \nKATE I don't know. K.D. Lang. \nLEOPOLD I don't know how you keep up with it. I'm exhausted. \nKATE So am I. \nLEOPOLD I'll tell you what. Why don't I prepare dinner tomorrow night? I never have before. I mean even before I hit town. \"Hit town\" How's that? I can't imagine what it'll taste like, but I don't think it will be any worse than your cooking. \nKATE Leopold, I have a date tomorrow night. \nLEOPOLD I see. \nKATE A blind date. \nLEOPOLD Oh, I'm so sorry. \nKATE No, that just means I haven't met him before. It was set up through friends. \nLEOPOLD Ah! \nKATE A hazard of single life... I'm turning in. \nKate gets up. Leopold automatically stands. \nLEOPOLD Another time then. \nKATE I'm sorry. \nLEOPOLD It's quite all right. \nAs she gets to the door, she stops. \nKATE Leopold? I had a wonderful time today. I can't remember the last time I took the day off and just played. I'd forgotten how beautiful this city can be... I want to thank you for that. \nLEOPOLD The pleasure was mine. \nKate smiles at Leopold and goes out. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCharlie, in a tie, is standing with Leopold at the dining room table. Kate wearing too much makeup for her date, runs into the bathroom in a BRIGHT RED DRESS. \nCHARLIE It's a very fancy restaurant, Leopold. Are you sure you can teach me everything there is to know? \nKATE (from the bathroom) Just don't swipe the silverware and give yourself away. \nCHARLIE Nobody's talking to you. \nLEOPOLD It is very simple. I will be your date. Just behave as you normally would and I'll correct you along the way. Now, escort me in. \nCharlie and Leopold move across the room. After a beat, Charlie magnanimously gestures for Leopold to go first. Leopold gives his approval. Kate rushes out of the bathroom in a tight BLACK dress. \nLeopold and Charlie elegantly walk to the table. Charlie sits down, pleased. Leopold remains standing, incensed. \nCHARLIE Now what? \nLeopold takes a cloth napkin, hits Charlie upside the head. Hard. \nLEOPOLD Pull the chair for a lady! Clod. \nKATE (V.O.) No name calling. \nLEOPOLD (to Kate) Well, really! \nCharlie stands up and pulls out the chair. As Leopold sits, Charlie pushes the chair in to hard. \nLEOPOLD You're not shoveling coal into a furnace, Charles. Glide the chair in gently. Gently. Try it again. \nCharlie gently glides Leopold to the table. He remains standing, not sure what to do next. \nLEOPOLD Well, sit down! \nCHARLIE Now don't burst a vein or anything, but there are quite a few knives and forks here. How do I know what each one's for? \nLEOPOLD Merely start from the outside and work your way in. \nCHARLIE What kind of beer should I order? \nLEOPOLD Beer! \nKATE About you? Ah, she said you were tall. \nLARRY \nKATE And nice looking. \nLARRY Thank you. \nKATE Thank her. And that you persevere ardently on Wall Street. \nLARRY Well, I work there... \nKATE (after a beat) That must be very interesting. \nLARRY (laughing) You've obviously never worked on Wall Street. \nKATE (laughing along for the hell of it) No. \nTheir laughter subsides. After a beat: \nLARRY What else did Jeannie say about me? \nINT. THE FOUR SEASONS - NIGHT \nThe Maitre d' of this very fancy restaurant shows Charlie and Patrice to their seats. Charlie motions Patrice to go first just as Leopold has instructed. \nThe Maitre de pulls out Patrice's chair. Charlie gives him a look to back off. Charlie effortlessly glides Patrice to the table and takes his seat. \nPATRICE Have I told you how much I liked your painting? \nCHARLIE (beaming) Twice. \nPATRICE If you get tired of hearing about it, let me know. I have to admit I was sort of surprised when you called. I didn't think you liked me, Charlie. \nCHARLIE When I first saw you, I thought... (he makes his jaw drop down to the floor) \nPATRICE What do you think now? \nCharlie smiles and places her hand over his heart. Then he makes his jaw drop again. Patrice laughs happily. \nINT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT \nKate and Larry are eating their dinner. \nKATE Aaand that's about all Jeannie said. What did Jeannie say about me? \nLARRY (smiling) She said you were enormously sexy, had a great body, but you don't put out. \nKATE Quite a compelling portrait. \nLARRY (turning on the charm) Would you say it's an accurate portrait? \nKATE (leaning into Larry) A masterpiece. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nLeopold slowly carries a dinner tray to the dinning room table. He moves to the window and looks out. After a while he pours a glass of wine. \nINT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT \nAs they eat their dinner Larry drones on. \nLARRY So this guy wants to invest $50,000 in a stock that's no good. Here's what I do... \nKate stares absentmindedly at Larry, her mind somewhere else. She looks down at the fork in her hand. She switches to the proper one, reflecting on Leopold's etiquette. She notices her napkin lying flat on the table. She reaches for it. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nLeopold unfolds his napkin and puts it on his lap. He begins to eat his dinner. Slowly. Elegantly. Alone. \nINT. SPORTS BAR - NIGHT \nKate places the napkin on her lap. She stares at it a long while. Finally she looks up at Larry. \nEXTREME CLOSE UP OF LARRY \nLARRY I'm telling you the guy was a DICK! A total ASSHOLE! \nKATE (jarred awake) Who? \nLARRY Jeff Murray. The guy I've been talking about. Hello? \nKATE (realizing her feelings for Leopold, smiling radiantly at Larry) Goodbye. \nINT. LIVING ROOM, LATER THAT NIGHT \nThe candles have burned down, casting a romantic glow throughout the apartment. Louis Armstrong's \"What a Wonderful World\" plays. Kate and Leopold sit on the couch sipping wine. \nLEOPOLD Tell me more. \nKATE Um, where was I? So after my father died I had to go to work. \nLEOPOLD Have you had many jobs? \nKATE Many. I got fired from all of them. I'm the most unskilled person I know. But they were just survival jobs while I was still in school. I always knew I wanted to go into science like my father. And I did. \nLEOPOLD Do you miss him? \nKATE I think about him every day. He was courtly, just like you. \nLEOPOLD I think you are a remarkable woman Katherine Coles. \nKATE You just don't get out much. You'd be surprised how remarkable I'm not. \nLEOPOLD No, it is you who would be surprised. \nThey kiss. Anxiously they stare into each other's eyes. They kiss again. Slowly, Kate leads him to her bedroom door. They look at each other, deciding. \nDeliberately, cautiously, Kate opens the door. \nLEOPOLD Kate... \nKate puts her fingers over Leopold's lips. Gently she leads him inside. They slowly embrace as the door closes. \nINT. BEDROOM - THE NEXT MORNING \nSunlight floods the room. Clothes are scattered about. Two figures lie curled up together sleeping in bed. One of the figures rolls around. The covers are pulled back revealing: \nCHARLIE Good morning. \nPATRICE Morning. \nThey kiss. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - MORNING \nLeopold wearing a bathrobe is pouring coffee. The table is set for a huge breakfast. Kate also in a robe enters from the hallway. There is a moment of awkwardness as they see each other for the first time. \nKATE Morning. \nLEOPOLD Good morning. \nThey kiss shyly. Kate notices the feast. \nKATE Look what you've done! \nLEOPOLD It's nothing. \nKATE Nothing? My own mother never made me a breakfast like this. \nLEOPOLD I will have to have a talk with her. \nKATE Leopold... \nLEOPOLD Kate... \nKATE About last night... \nLEOPOLD Please sit down. \nHe pulls out a chair for her and kneels beside her. \nLEOPOLD Kate, I had never before been a considerate man. I had, with astonishing complacency, squandered my life, waiting for some incentive to force me into action. You have made me see how rare our time here really is. I am most beholden to you Kate. And always will be. \nKATE I sense the word \"BUT\" entering into this any minute now. \nLeopold takes her hands in his. She looks at him defensively, bracing for worst. \nLEOPOLD Do me the honor Katherine, of becoming my wife. \nKate lets out a very girlish, high pitched scream \nLEOPOLD Shall I take that as a \"yes\"? \nKATE Leopold! Did you just ask me to marry you? \nLeopold and Kate sit on her bed watching David Lettering. Kate clutches her pillow close to her. She looks over at Leopold concentrating on the TV with furrowed brow. She smiles sadly. She takes her pillow and flings it off her bed. She snuggles up to Leopold. They watch TV. Together. \nEXT. N.Y.C. - DAY \nCentral Park in full bloom, Botanical Gardens, The Frock Museum. \nINT. RESTAURANT - DAY \nLeopold and Kate eat lunch. Leopold scans a newspaper. On the TV over the bar, Bob Dole is speaking out against gun control. \nLEOPOLD Public office is apparently still the last refuge for the incompetent. Show me a man who does not want his gun registered and I'll show you a man who should not own a gun. What is a pee-pee girl? \nKATE What are you reading? \nLEOPOLD The Village Voice. After much consideration, I have decided it is time I join the work force. \nKATE As a pee-pee girl? \nLEOPOLD Perhaps not that, but I am determined to acquire honest employment. \nKATE Leopold, I don't know if that's such a good idea. \nLEOPOLD Kate, my life back home was beneficial to no one. I want my new life to have value. I won't make the same mistakes twice. \nKATE You have to be patient. \nLEOPOLD I could conceivably wait my whole life away. \nKATE You're awfully cute when you get causey. \nLEOPOLD I will not waste any more time. I must make a difference. \nINT. BLOOMINGDALES - DAY \nCustomers fill the aisles. In the center of it all, Leopold is hard at work. He holds a bottle of perfume. \nLEOPOLD Try our fragrance? Would you like to try our new fragrance today? \nRICH CUSTOMER What is it? \nLEOPOLD It is called, POISON. \nHe squirts some at her. \nRICH CUSTOMER Oh! I don't think so. Have you got PASSION? \nLEOPOLD I beg your pardon? \nRICH CUSTOMER Elizabeth Taylor's Passion? \nLEOPOLD Next aisle over. \nShe leaves. Leopold looks after her. \nLEOPOLD (after a beat) Give your mother-in-law what she really deserves this season. Give her some POISON. \nINT. KATE'S LABORATORY OFFICE - MORNING \nThe doctors enter Kate's office and closes the door. \nKATE Hi. (the doctors remain silent) What's the matter? \nThere is a long pause. Slowly Kate realizes the doctors are on to her. She puts down her pen. \nKATE So you know. \nDR. KAU We had to go through your computer to access information. Your calculations have been verified and the final course has been set. Leopold goes back a week from Friday 1:17 a.m. \nDR. PLODDER How long were you going to keep it a secret, Kate? \nDR. DRAKE Were you even going to tell us at all? \nKATE I'm not sure. \nDR. PLODDER Not sure? What can you be thinking? You can't alter the course of history and assume everything will be okay. It won't be. He has his own destiny to fulfill in his own time. \nKATE (quietly) You don't understand. \nDR. DRAKE (gently) He's going back, Kate. \nDR. PLODDER It's over. \nKate nods. The doctors slowly leave the room and close the door. Just the sound of the clock ticking. \nLeopold leads Kate to the dance floor. He opens his arms and Kate steps in the way she was taught in class. Leopold pulls her close. \nThis time there is no pretending. Partnered together, they shine. They move beautifully, effortlessly. It's almost more than they can bear. As the music plays, they stop. Leopold holds Kate tightly. They look at each other for the longest time. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LABORATORY - EARLY MORNING \nLarge screen computers are working overtime. Kate, Leopold, and Charlie accompany the doctors to the capsule. It is nearly time. \nDR. DRAKE The time tables have been set. Just strap yourself in and you'll be fine. \nDR. PLODDER You have only a twenty four hour leeway before the machine is set to return to us. You must find Carlson within that time frame and get her on board or there will be little chance of her finding a way back. \nLEOPOLD I understand. \nDR. DRAKE It's been a real pleasure. You have a much nicer smile than Ronald Coleman. \nLEOPOLD The privilege was mine. \nDR. KAU Goodbye Leopold, and thank you. (she gives him a kiss) \nLEOPOLD Oh, my. \nDR. KAU Don't worry. We'll send Kate to you... as soon as possible. I'll see to it myself. \nLEOPOLD See that you do. \nDR. KAU You have my word on it. \nThe doctors leave. \nDR. DRAKE Four minutes and counting. \nCHARLIE Well? I'll make this quick. Goodbye. \nHe sticks out his hand. \nLEOPOLD Goodbye. (impulsively Leopold embraces Charlie) I shall miss you Charles, more than you know. \nCHARLIE I'll miss you too, Leopold... You're the only one who knows how to program the VCR... Take care of my sister. \nLEOPOLD I will. \nCARLSON You better. Take care of yourself too while you're at it... So long. \nKATE I don't have any words for this. \nLEOPOLD I will see you soon. \nKATE I know. \nLEOPOLD You'll be with me all the time. \nKATE I know. I brought you something. \nShe takes out a ring and slips it on his finger. \nKATE So you wouldn't forget me. \nLEOPOLD Kate... \nKATE So you wouldn't think this was all a dream. \nThey kiss. \nKATE Don't forget about me. \nLEOPOLD I love you, Kate. \nKATE Wait for me. \nLEOPOLD For as long as it takes. \nKATE I will come back to you! I will! \nLEOPOLD I'll be waiting. \nThey kiss again for the last time. \nDR. DRAKE It's time Leopold. \nLeopold holds Kate's face in his hands. Very slowly they part. \nCARLSON You'd leave in 9 days. That's not a lot of time to get your affairs in order... And I warn you, it's nearly impossible for an intelligent woman back there. \nKate stands by the back door, looking out at Leo. \nCARLSON He's a fine boy Kate. Leopold would be proud. We're aware of your situation but we felt when the time came, you deserved the option. \nKate nods, trembling slightly. \nINT. FARM HOUSE - NIGHT \nKate stands in the doorway as Carlson drives off. \nLEO Who was that lady? \nKATE Just an old friend. \nLEO What she want? \nKATE (she looks at Leo) Nothing important. You brush your teeth? \nLeo shows off his teeth. \nKATE Then give your old mom a hug and go to bed. (Leo gives her a hug and a kiss) Good night, cookie. \nLEO Good night. \nKate wraps herself in an old blanket and moves through the house turning off the lights. It is very guiet. All we hear are Kate's footsteps and the sound of the clock ticking. \nShe makes her way upstairs, enters her bed room. She sits down by the window at her desk. She sits a long time lost in thought. \nShe slowly pulls open a drawer and from deep inside pulls out an old photo album. She opens it and begins to look through. \nCUT TO: \nTHE PHOTO ALBUM \nInside, old black and white photographs, newspaper clippings, magazine articles trace Leopold throughout his life. \nA photograph of Leopold looking as he did the night he departed this world. He stands stiffly beside his family for a formal portrait. Very discreetly, he points to a ring. It is the same ring Kate gave him. \nA newspaper article shows Leopold donating $100,000 to establish a scientific center researching studies in time and space. \nA magazine picture shows Leopold, the sole male figure, marching to give women the vote. \nA photograph of a large formal wedding. Leopold, around FIFTY, stands alone in the wedding party, surreptitiously pointing to his ring. \nA magazine article shows Leopold in his SIXTIES establishing a scholarship program for studies in physics. He is surrounded by academia and subtly points to his ring. \nA photograph of Leopold around SEVENTY shaking hands with Albert Einstein and smiling broadly for the cameras. \nA professional photograph of Leopold at SEVENTY FIVE, sitting regally in a chair. Beside him, an EMPTY chair. He rests one hand on the back of the chair. The other he holds against his chest, showing off the ring. \nAn obituary with the headline, \"Philanthropist, 80, dies in bombings. \nA tear falls on the page. \nKate cries silently, looking out the window. The camera follows her gaze past her property... \nCUT TO: \nINT. BANQUET ROOM - YEARS LATER \nLEO, 24 and his BRIDE take to the floor for the first time as husband and wife and are greeted with applause. Kate, older, beautiful, hair cut short, looks on in wonder. \nCharlie, standing with Patrice and their 6 blonde children, approaches Kate and leads her to the dance floor. \nKATE He's so YOUNG, Charlie. \nCHARLIE He's old enough. \nKATE Look at that idiotic expression on his face. \nCHARLIE He's happy. \nKATE Of course he's happy. All weddings are happy. It's the living together afterwards that causes all the trouble. \nJulia Carlson, under dressed, over anxious, enters the banquet hall. She stands at the back of the large room, searching. \nCouples fill the dance floor. Across the expansive room, over the tops of heads, Charlie and Kate bob amongst the guests. Leo cuts in. As they spin, in the briefest of seconds, Kate spots Carlson. She pales. They TURN. \nKate peers over Leo's shoulder. Her eyes lock with Julia's. Julia nods with purpose. Kate holds onto Leo tightly, not wanting to let go. She buries her head in his chest. \nKATE Oh, you're so young... I love you, Leo. Always remember that... \n", "test1_input": "KATE (eyes closed, screaming like a fishwife) WHAT IS IT, LEOPOLD?! \nLeopold's bell rings with determination. Kate is off the bed and out of the room. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nKate enters and stops short. Leopold sits at the table ringing a BELL. The dishwasher is open and SPRAYING WILDLY, the blender has spread breakfast shake EVERYWHERE, water is BOILING OVER on the stove, refrigerator, freezer, and every cupboard door is OPEN. Garbage disposal runs FULL BLAST. \nLEOPOLD (calmly amidst the chaos) I cannot seem to find the tea... \nCLOSE UP: Leopold's hand rings a bell with irritation. \nINT. CHARLIE'S BEDROOM - EVENING \nLeopold, Kate, and Charlie stand in front of Charlie's open closet. Leopold selects clothes from Charlie's wardrobe. \nLEOPOLD No... No... No. Good God, no!... Perhaps... \nHe tosses them aside carelessly as Charlie seethes. \nCLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell. \nINT. HALLWAY - EARLY MORNING \nKate and Charlie form a line to the bathroom. Kate checks her schedule and bangs on the door. \nKATE Leopold, your time is up! What's he got, a girl in there? \nINT. BATHROOM - EARLY MORNING \nLeopold Luxuriates in the bathtub wearing a \"Whitecap\" marveling at the whirlpool and the instant hot water. He picks up a can of shaving cream and inspects it in wonder. It SPRAYS. \nCLOSE UP: Leopold rings his bell. Nothing happens. He discovers the clapper has been stolen. \nINT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON \nKate types, talks and researches simultaneously. She looks up and stops suddenly. \nLeopold appears wearing MANY oddly assorted layers of Charlie's clothes, a bandanna bow tie, Irish woolen cap, bicycle gloves, aluminum baseball bat walking stick. He poses foppishly. \nLEOPOLD I should like to read about modern currency during my bath tonight. See that the tub and basin are scrubbed up. Remnants remain of this afternoons shave. \nKate nods at him stupefied. Due to the many layers of clothing, he imperiously leaves the room walking as if wearing skis. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLeopold rings a BIG NEW COWBELL. No one responds. \nINT. CHARLIE'S WORKROOM - NIGHT (CONTINUOUS) \nHe discovers Kate at her computer, Charlie reading a book. Each are wearing a walkman. \nHe stands in front of them and rings his cowbell furiously until they look up. \nINT. STUDY - DAY \nLeopold studies his questionnaire, Kate researches Victorian customs. They simultaneously look up and gaze at the other. A beat. \nEmbarrassed, Kate dons her glasses and Leopold shuffles papers. They look up again. Then down. Then get back to work. \nINT. KATE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nKate sits on her bed with her laptop watching David Letterman. She glances up, laughs out loud. She looks at the dark empty room. No one is there to share it with. Closing her computer, she holds her pillow close to her. She slowly moves to the window and looks out. \nINT. LEOPOLD'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nA text book with Leopold's picture inside. Leopold reads the brief summary of his life with heartbreaking astonishment. He moves to the window and looks out. \nEXT. N.Y.C. APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nKate and Leopold gaze out of their windows. The camera slowly pulls back until they are swallowed up by the city. \nINT. KATE'S STUDY - AFTERNOON \nKate scans her notes as Leopold paces dully about the room. \nKATE In our last session you intimated there was a symmetrical system regulating the social order of conformity spanning your era. I found this particularly intriguing If I can just find it in my notes... \nA fire engine races by. Leopold dashes to the window then turns back, excited. \nLEOPOLD The fire brigade! \nKate stares at him blankly. She munches RICE CAKES and drinks water FROM THE BOTTLE. A beat. She returns to her notes. \n", "test1_true": "KATE Found it. \nLEOPOLD (startled) A resolution? \nKATE No I meant I found my notes. \nLEOPOLD Dr. Coles! Changes are in order. \nKATE I can hear you. \nLEOPOLD (under control now) Miss Coles, as we are to remain here together, there are certain conditions I insist are met and maintained. I no longer wish to be peeped at, mocked... \nKATE I never... \nLEOPOLD (calmly) Or interrupted. Jot this down. Breakfast at 12. Luncheon at 4. Diner at 8. A horse should be made available from 1 to 3. \nKATE A horse? In New York City? \nLEOPOLD Yes. Also, I feel very strongly about your style of dress. I do not care for it. (Kate looks up) I cannot believe it is the prevailing taste for women to appear masculine and unkempt. If this is the fashion, have it altered. \nKate rises. \nLEOPOLD That is all for the present. \nHe grandly hands her a napkin. \nLEOPOLD CRUMBS, my dear! \nKATE (infuriated) Thank you! \nBrushing herself off, she heads to the door. \nLEOPOLD Dr. Coles. I have been acquainted with many women in my time, yet I am compelled to say that the modern woman is by far the least attractive I have ever encountered. \nKATE (rising to the occasion) And I have a news flash of my own. \nLeopold waits. \nKATE You sir, are no Ronald Coleman! \nShe storms out. \nINT. LAB - EARLY MORNING \nDr. Drake enters Dr. Kau's office with two pints of Haagen Dazs. \nDR. DRAKE Chocolate Peanut Butter Cookie Dough Swirl or Peach? \nDR. KAU Peach. \nThey dig in. \nDR. DRAKE Any luck? \nDR. KAU Yea. Lots of luck. All bad. No information exists detailing what happened to Carlson. I've been working for weeks and I'm not any closer than when I began... How are you doing? \nDR. DRAKE My cholesterol level is up 70 points. \nKate enters, exhausted, deposits an armful of papers on Dr. Drake's desk. Kate has pencils tucked behind her ear, through her hair, and in her mouth. \nDR. DRAKE Thank you, Kate... How're you managing with Leopold? \nKATE Fine. Fine... Why? What did you hear? \nDR. DRAKE Nothing. I was just asking. \nKATE Oh. Well, it's fine. He's a delight. Everything's under control. \nDR. KAU Keep up the good work. (after she's gone) She seemed a little scattered. Do you think everything's all right? \nDR. DRAKE Katherine Coles is the most capable person we have on this project. If anyone can handle the delicacy of this situation, Kate can. \nDR. KAU So there's nothing to worry about? \nDR. DRAKE Absolutely not. \nINT. CHARLIE'S STUDIO - EARLY EVENING \nKATE GONE? GONE WHERE?! (Charlie shrugs) Charlie we've got to find him! \nCHARLIE (working on a VERY STERN portrait of Kate at her computer) Are you crazy? This is the first time all week my eyes aren't darting to the top of my sockets every five minutes. \n", "test2_input": "KATE When did he leave? \nCHARLIE I don't know. An hour ago? He said he wanted to take a walk. \nKATE And you let him?? He's not allowed to go outside! \nCHARLIE Is he being punished? \nKATE We've got to find him! You stay here in case he finds his way back. And while you wait you'd better pray he's all right. If anything happens to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING we've worked for will have been destroyed. \nShe heads out the door. Charlie follows. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING \nCHARLIE Kate, calm down. \nKATE And YOU'LL be responsible. Understand? (she grabs her coat and purse) \nCHARLIE What's the big deal? Who is this guy? \nKate takes a LONG pause. \nKATE Leopold... is not really from Canada. \nEXT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON \nPeaceful. The sun sets. Pigeons rest on window sills. Suddenly: \nCHARLIE (V.O.) OH MY GOD!!! \nThe pigeons take flight. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - EVENING \nLeopold leaves Central Park profoundly lost. Looking both ways in the wrong direction, he crosses the street. SCREECHING brakes, HONKING horns, FURIOUS shouts with Leopold, horrified, caught in the middle. He makes it across shaking and dazed. A motorist pulls along side of him. \nWOMAN MOTORIST You stupid fucking son of a bitch. Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron. \nLeopold GAPES, appalled. A Hansom carriage slowly treads into Central Park. Leopold watches until it disappears. \nINT. KATE'S GREEN A.M.C. PACER - NIGHT \nKate drives slowly, searching for Leopold. Cars honk with mounting anger. \nCABBY What're ya waiting for lady? An invitation? \nKATE I'm sorry! I'm sorry! \nShe continues searching, trying hard to remain calm. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT \nHuge buildings. Neon lights flashing. Garbage in bundles. Calvin Klein Ads. In the center of it all, Leopold, jostled BADLY by the crowd, tipping his hat to all the ladies. He enters a deli. \nINT. DELI - NIGHT \nLeopold, appalled by the prices searches for money. He has none. \nLEOPOLD (to the counter man) $7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct? \nCOUNTER MAN You gotta problem with that? \nLEOPOLD It seems rather pricey to me. \nCOUNTER MAN So don't buy one. \nLEOPOLD I shan't. \nCOUNTER MAN So shan't! \nHe moves on. \nLEOPOLD Yes, I... I would be happy to sample one however I'm afraid I haven't the finance with me just now. If I could establish a credit with you, I will have someone come round with the funds tomorrow. \nCOUNTER MAN You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a hamburger today, is that it? \nLEOPOLD (a little confused) I believe so. Yes. \nCOUNTER MAN Get the fuck outta here. \nLEOPOLD I beg your pardon? \nCOUNTER MAN Get out. Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off. \n", "test2_true": "YUPPIE WOMAN You tell him. \nLEOPOLD Need I add that without our patronage you would not own that unwashed counter behind which you spew your filthy mouth? \nCOUNTER MAN Where do you get off? You don't even have any money. \nLEOPOLD Don't be irrelevant... I'm browsing. \nCOUNTER MAN Not in my store you're not. \nHe comes out from behind the counter. He's big. \nLEOPOLD (very superior) Do you intend to physically escort me out...? \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nLeopold is thrown out of the store and on to the street. \nLEOPOLD Did you see what he did? Did you see that? \nNo one responds. Leopold is left sprawled on the street. Thunder is heard. \nEXT. N.Y.C. - NIGHT \nGargoyles at New York City Library, The Dakota, the Bowery, Alphabet City. \nEXT. CLAIRMOUNT STABLES - 4 A.M. \nPouring rain. Leopold stands in front of the stables beaten and drenched. A car drives by, screeches to a stop, and hastily backs up along side Leopold. \nKATE Leopold! Leopold, get in. \nLeopold stares at the car. Kate runs out, opens the door and helps him in. She dashes back into the drivers seat. \nINT. CAR - 4 A.M. \nKATE (nearly in tears, trying to dry him off) Leopold! Oh, Leopold thank God you're all right. I didn't think I'd ever find you. You had us all so worried. Oh, Leopold! \nShe hits him hard. \nKATE Don't you ever go out again without my permission, do you hear me? I was frantic. You could have been killed a hundred times over. I never would have known. \nShe rests her head on the steering wheel, exhausted. She pulls herself together and looks at him. \nKATE Leopold, are you all right? \nLEOPOLD (looking deep into her eyes for the first time) I wish to go home. \nKATE Okay. I'll get you home in a jiffy. \nLEOPOLD (badly shaken) No... I wish to go home. \nKate gently observes Leopold who stares rigidly straight ahead. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCHARLIE (on the phone) I don't know. It's just Leopold. Like Cher. Or Goofy. \nKate and Leopold walk in wet and exhausted. \nCHARLIE Never mind they just walked in. Jesus. You look horrible. \nKATE Charlie, don't start. I haven't been this angry at you since you got me into that pyramid thing last year. If you make a wisecrack I'm going to burst into flame. \nCHARLIE It wasn't a wisecrack. You do look horrible. \nKATE I'm too tired for this now. I'll just save it up and kill you tomorrow. Help Leopold out of his things and lets get him to bed. \nLEOPOLD I've something to say. To the both of you. I... Nothing is what it seems. After witnessing mere weeks of this age it is painfully apparent I am outside of my acquaintance... I don't know how to proceed. I frankly... am in need of assistance. I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this. In the event you have missed it, I am apologizing. \nThere is a long pause. \nCHARLIE About time. (he shakes Leopold's hand reluctantly) Welcome back. (he leaves) \nKATE Don't mind him. His heart would be in the right place if he had a heart. Surliness runs in my family. \nLEOPOLD I understand. It practically races through mine. \nKATE (shocked) Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one that's not at my expense. That's good. \nThey look at each other just a second too long. \n", "test3_input": "LEOPOLD Who is this woman sitting across from me? \nKATE What do you want me to say, Leopold? \nLEOPOLD Tell me that you love me as I love you. Let me hear you say it. \nKate remains silent. Leopold abruptly throws money on the table. \nLEOPOLD I will not do this. I'm sorry. \nWe starts out. \nKATE Leopold! \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nLeopold walks out of the restaurant trying to remain calm. His emotions get the best of him. Finally, exhausted, he winds up walking along Central Park South. \nHansom Carriages wait to be taken out. He approaches slowly. He stops along side one of the cabs and strokes the horse's head. \nHe looks at the horse for a long time. Then he looks at the skyscrapers surrounding him, deciding what to do. He lays his face against the horse's head, torn. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY MORNING \nKate sits at the dinning room table behind empty Sara Lee boxes, pints of ice cream, beer bottles, and is working her way through the cookie dough. Leopold enters through the front door, DISHEVELED. \nLEOPOLD Good God. Look at you. You look awful. \nKATE You should see what I'm looking at. \nLEOPOLD I went back to the restaurant. They told me you went out looking for me right after I left. \nKATE That was pound cakes ago. Where were you? \nLEOPOLD I had a lot to think over. \nKATE Such as? \nLEOPOLD Just where I stand around here. \nThere is a long pause. \nKATE (quietly) We should have come up with something together. I might have been spared ten or seventy pounds. \nLEOPOLD Is that an apology? \nKATE I'm sorry for what I said. \nLeopold goes to her. He gently prys cookie dough from her hands. \nLEOPOLD I'm not going anywhere. \nKATE Yes you are... \nLEOPOLD I'm not going. I'm staying here with you. \nKATE But? You can't! We have no right to... \nLEOPOLD It is my destiny. It is my decision. \nKATE Have you thought about what you'd be sacrificing? Your influence? Your authority? \nThey kiss. \nKATE Your family, your whole way of life, everything? \nThey kiss. \nKATE You're not just feeling sorry for me because I ate the contents of the refrigerator, are you? \nThey kiss. \nLEOPOLD I love you, Kate. The single most miraculous event in my life was not how I arrived here, but that when I did, I found you. \nKATE (overwhelmed) Here comes the mushy part! \nLEOPOLD After much consideration I've come to the conclusion I no longer desire a large estate with a full staff and ornate grounds. \nKATE That's good, because if you're staying I'll probably get fired again. What do you desire? \nLEOPOLD A beautiful wife, a small home in the middle of nowhere, lots of children, and fine schools with PMS meetings every other Sunday. \n", "test3_true": "LEOPOLD PTA. \nKATE I love you too. I do, Leopold. I love you, too. \nThey kiss. \nINT. LABORATORY - DAY \nLeopold and Kate sit calm and resolute. The doctors are in an uproar. \nDR. PLODDER This is outrageous! I won't allow it! \nLEOPOLD The decision is not yours to make. \nDR. PLODDER Do you realize what you're saying? You're tampering with fate, preordinance, and God himself. \nLEOPOLD We do that every day, doctor. It is called CHOICE. \nDR. KAU Dr. Carlson is still over there. You can't simply abandon her. We have to get her back. \nKATE Do you think I'm not aware of that? Do you think a minute goes by that I don't feel responsible for her? But SOMEONE ELSE CAN GO. \nDR. KAU Only one person can return. The capsule accommodates only one person. Leopold has to find her. \nLEOPOLD Perhaps she does not wish to return. Perhaps she's found greater happiness in her new life. It happened to me. \nKATE Maybe this is her destiny. Maybe she's of more important use back there. \nDR. KAU Julia Carlson died in the Center Factory fire of 1897, two years after she arrived. She was 37 years old. \nThere is a stunned silence. \nDR. DRAKE Dear lord. \nDR. KAU She was a friend, Kate. She was never expected to sacrifice her life for this experiment. I won't be a party to it. I know what I'm asking... There's no way we can force you to go. Just think it over. \nINT. BEDROOM - 2:30 A.M. \nA clock is ticking loudly. Kate and Leopold lie back to back. \nKATE You're going back aren't you? \nLEOPOLD I keep seeing that poor woman's face. She was terrified. \nKATE You said you wouldn't leave me... I've never been lucky. Not one time. \nLEOPOLD Six months ago I wouldn't have given it another thought. I wouldn't have lost a moment's sleep. You've changed me, Kate. There is no turning back. \nKATE I wouldn't WANT you to change. That's what's tearing me up inside. Either way I lose... You've changed me too. I can't go back to my old life anymore. I can't live like that again. God my heart is pounding like a drum. I've never been so scared in my life. Take me with you, Leopold. God. Take me with you. \nLEOPOLD You don't realize what you're saying! You don't understand the kind of life you'd lead. What you'd be giving up. \nKATE I'd be with you. \nLEOPOLD I can't ask that of you. \nKATE Just ask me... Just ask. \nLEOPOLD Come back with me. \nShe slowly turns. She embraces him. \nKATE Yes! \nEXT. N.Y.C. STREET - NIGHT \nDressed to the nines, Leopold leads a blindfolded Kate through the street. She is clumsier than usual. \nKATE Where are you taking me? \nLEOPOLD This is something I've wanted to do for a long time. \nShe takes off her blindfold and looks up at the sign: ROSELAND. \nKATE Leopold? \nLEOPOLD This will be very therapeutic. \nHe takes her arm and escorts her in. \nINT. ROSELAND - NIGHT \n"}

{"test1_input": "\"KATE AND LEOPOLD\" \nScreenplay by \nJames Mangold and Steven Rogers \nBased on a story by \nSteven Rogers \nFADE IN: \nINT. VICTORIAN ESTATE - 1895 - DAY \nCLOSE UP: Ornate antique GRANDFATHER CLOCK strikes 2:15. \nThe credits begin to roll. \nCalligraphy place cards are painstakingly hand-written in preparation for a formal reception. \nServants meticulously clean an elaborate crystal chandelier. \nHands rapidly shine silver cutlery. \nFresh flowers arranged in several enormous vases. \nINT. KITCHEN - DAY \nKitchen clock strikes 2:15. \nPoultry plucked. Feathers everywhere. \nSteaming copper pots boiling over. Platters prepared with decorative garnish. \nExtravagant tiered cake is lavishly iced. A glob of frosting enters a pair of puckered lips. The perpetrator, a fey, pompous, HEAD VALET, seriously considers the texture and flavor of the icing, then gives the PASTRY CHEF a withering, sour look. \nThe valet, oblivious to the chef's fury, gathers a prepared silver breakfast tray and checks his pocket watch. 2:15. \nINT. BEDROOM - DAY \nAntique bedside table clock -- just past 2:15. The valet throws open velvet drapes, sunlight FLOODS the room revealing a figure sleeping soundly in a massive oak framed bed. The valet puts down the tray, pulls back the quilt. \nThe dozing figure gives the valet a deliberate, angry KICK. \nFlinching infinitesimally, the valet crosses to the closet, selects three suits and holds them up for inspection. From beneath the puffiest of pillows, AN EYE reluctantly opens. A weary arm points decisively to the riding outfit. \nEXT. ESTATE - DAY \nThe riding outfit is adorned by LEOPOLD, Duke of Albany, a dashing, virile man in his 30's. GALLOPING with great abandon, he expertly leads his horse up hills and over hedges. He sends gardeners shaping the grounds fleeing from his path. \nIn the background, lanterns are being strung throughout the estate. Rugs are beaten out of open windows. \nINT. HALLWAY - EVENING \nLarge hallway clock -- 6:15. A pair of boots track a freshly scrubbed floor as Leopold heads carelessly up the stairway. Three steps behind, the valet snaps his fingers signaling the staff to clean up the mess. \nSERIES OF CLOSE UPS \nGaudily framed portraits of somber relations. \nA bird sits listless in a gilded cage. \nHot water is poured into a bath. \nCarriages begin to arrive. \nOrchestra leader signals the musicians to play. \nGuests fill the ballroom in formal attire. \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nLeopold stares haughtily into a full length mirror. \nHe wears only dotted linen drawers and a black silk top hat of the period. He flexes slightly. The valet hastily fastens a corset around his mid-section from behind. \nLeopold eyes his reflection seductively. He becomes bored. \nHe turns to his right. The valet spoons sorbet from a silver saucer into his mouth. He turns back to the mirror to watch himself eat. The valet pats his mouth dry. \nHe affects a pampered STRUT, crossing the room as the valet sprays a mixture of perfume and powder into the air. Leopold thrusts out his arms walking through the mist, turns and saunters back to his favorite place, in front of the mirror. \nFinally, as if weighing a great decision, Leopold hands his hat to his valet and nods firmly into the mirror. \n", "test1_true": "Fine linen undervest slides over his head. \nBlack twilled worsted trousers pulled up to his waist. \nThe buttoning of his hard, white, roll collar. \nA cream suede glove stitched in black slides over his hand. \nA perfect tight bow tie is tied around his neck. \nAn elegant black tuxedo jacket with silk facings and tails to the knees is fitted to his torso. \nHis hair is sleeked with oil and centrally parted. \nHis eyebrows are brushed with a tiny silver comb. \nHis cheeks are pinched. \nA red silk handkerchief is placed in the bosom of his lapel. \nLeopold stares into the mirror. The effect is DAZZLING. He raises one eyebrow. Then, in a voice you could pour over a waffle: \nLEOPOLD You dance like a herd of cattle, Miss Fairchild. You are a rare woman who lights up the room... simply by leaving it. \nHe bows. As he rises, the reflection of Leopold's UNCLE OTTO, a pampered, effectual man in his 60's, appears behind Leopold in the looking glass. \nUNCLE OTTO Tell me Leopold, do you plan to join us downstairs after completing this one-sided flash of wit? \nLEOPOLD I despise affairs of this sort, Uncle Otto. No one really listens to anyone else. If you attempt it, you will see why. \nUNCLE OTTO You judge everything too severely. I wonder what would happen if you were to cast that critical eye inward? \nLEOPOLD You do not wonder at all. You merely ask in order to state your own opinion. \nUNCLE OTTO We are all concerned about you. \nLEOPOLD Ahh, here it comes. \nUNCLE OTTO Your life does not seem to have any direction. At the age of 25 a man is too young to do anything well. At 35 he is too old. Now is your time to take action. Tell me, what is it you want to DO with your life? \nLEOPOLD (wearily) I do not know. \nUNCLE OTTO (just as weary) Your ignorance cramps my conversation. (he slaps Leopold's face twice rather quickly) Wake up! This is your one and only life. Every man has the chance to make a difference. DO something! \nLeopold, stung, takes a moment to compose himself. \nLEOPOLD I am most grateful for your surveillance and for your sympathy. I assure you there is no need for concern. I am as effectual and attentive... as my position allows. \nUNCLE OTTO Life is not position, Leopold. It is action. (he straightens Leopold's tie) I will see you downstairs promptly. In the appropriate frame of mind. \nHe leaves. Leopold stares into the mirror, snaps his fingers. The valet hands him a glass and pours a small shot of brandy. Leopold shoots him a look. The valet fills the glass higher. \nLeopold drains the glass and heads to the doorway. He hesitates, taking a deep breath and a long pause. Finally... \nTHE VALET (grandly) Go spread joy. \nWithout looking back, Leopold leaves the room. \nINT. BALLROOM - NIGHT \nMusic fills the air as the creme de la creme of Victorian society gather inside. Leopold holds a prearranged dance card. He looks at the names and finds his first partner is MISS TREE. Leopold looks upward helplessly at an unrelenting God. \nINT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nA profoundly self-conscious Leopold dances energetically into frame with MISS TREE, an ancient, elfin, yet amazingly SPRY woman who gapes up at him searchingly, unblinking. \nLeopold opens his mouth to speak, can think of nothing suitable to say, and clamps his mouth shut. They dance out of frame. \nINT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nLeopold dances into frame with CLARA, a BEAUTIFUL girl of 19. He glances at her and smiles. She titters, turning away shyly. They whirl around the dance floor. His smile grows into a broad grin. Caught up in the excitement, Clara beams up at him... happily revealing a mouth full of missing, inky teeth. \nLeopold, face frozen in a formal smile, dances on. \nINT. BALLROOM DANCE FLOOR - NIGHT \nLeopold lumbers into frame with MISS FAIRCHILD, a woman of immense girth. With great dignity and extreme difficulty he maneuvers her around the floor, looking everywhere except her enormous bosom. \nLEOPOLD You dance like an angel, Miss Fairchild. You light up the room. I thank you. \nMiss Fairchild curtseys heavily. Leopold glances at his card, sees the name Miss Serena Clacket and shudders. \n", "test1_id": 729, "test2_input": "KATE ...say... Goodbye. \nDr. Plodder bursts in. Kate sees his distress and instantly becomes very centered. \nDR. PLODDER She's back. \nKATE (rising) That's impossible! She wasn't supposed to return until... \nDR. PLODDER Kate. It's Carlson. Something went wrong. \nHe hands her Carlson's note pad. Slowly, she sits down. \nKATE ...The 7th Duke... \nINT. LAB - DAY \nKATE (all business, reading from a printout) ...of Albany. He was the... IS the son of Emery and Eliza. He was of no actual importance until he vanished at the turn of the century without a trace. It was a sensation. In the 30's they even made a movie about him. \"The Tenuous Duke\" with Ronald Coleman. \nDR. DRAKE (absently) I love Ronald Coleman. \nKATE Despite much speculation and a nation wide investigation, a body was never found. He was never heard from again. \nDR. KAU Until now. \nThere is a stunned silence. They stare at Leopold in awe. \nDR. DRAKE We've altered the course of history. \nDR. KAU We never should have started this... \nKATE Calm down. \nDR. PLODDER What are we going to do? We can't keep him here. Imagine if anyone found out! \nKATE Think. Just, think. Rationally. Now, no one would believe such a stupid mistake could be made because no one would believe any of this is possible. So. We fix this. We keep this to ourselves and we fix it. Fast. \nThey all nod in agreement. \nKATE Dr. Kau, research all our data. 1st priority: Locate Carlson. Drake, determine the reciprocal correlation's connected to the 19th century. Work 24 hours a day if necessary. In the meantime... one of us will have to take charge of him. \nShe forces back panic. Only the tremor in her voice gives her away. \nKATE This is a major scientific opportunity. It doesn't get any better than this. Imagine. Researching the behavior, the physical and emotional characteristics of a century ago! Utilizing technology available to us today... He's a gold mine! \nDR. PLODDER He's a man, Kate. Not a guinea pig. \nKATE And while he's here, he's ours. Any volunteers? \nNo one moves. \nDR. DRAKE We'll draw names. Whoever is is picked will be responsible. Agreed? \nThey nod reluctantly. Drake writes out names and throws them in a cup. The silence becomes deafening. Finally: \nDR. KAU I'll do it. \nAll the scientists face her. \nDR. PLODDER You'll look after him? \nDR. KAU No, I meant I'll pick the name. \nShe reaches in. They wait with mounting suspense. Finally SHE TURNS TO KATE. The scientists follow her gaze. A beat. \nKATE Fine. \nLeopold stirs. He blinks at the group. \nLEOPOLD Where...? What has happened?! \nThe doctors, caught off guard, SMILE BENIGNLY. They surround Leopold as a group, not knowing where to begin. Finally: \nKATE Your Grace... Um... Hello... Weee aaare a smaaall part of a laaarge research team. A project funded by the government of the United States. \nLEOPOLD (regarding their appearance with distaste) Oh. Americans. I see... \nKATE Yes, um... For the past six and a half years we've been conducting scientific experiments on density and flexibility in the dimensions of time and space. \nDR. DRAKE Yes, uh... Quite by accident we came upon a formula utilizing Tachyons... particles traveling faster than the speed of light, which allowed us to... fold time so to speak. \nDR. PLODDER Yes. Bend it between the cracks of the dimensions. \nDR. KAU Yes. \n", "test2_true": "DR. DRAKE Now, while that wasn't the original purpose of our experiment, we opted to pursue it, well, privately, on our own. \nDR. KAU Borrowing funds already provided. \nKATE We journeyed to your time because it was the quickest path to follow. We debated long and hard whether we should use this knowledge at all. Believe me, it was never our intent to disturb the past... \nDR. DRAKE Merely to discover if the expedition were possible. As your presence here confirms... we are very disturbed. \nLeopold nods at them as if they are insane. \nDR. PLODDER The problem facing us is not only HOW to get you back, but WHEN, you see? \nKATE We certainly don't want to miscalculate. Send you to a different era entirely. \nLeopold starts to speak. \nDR. PLODDER Rest assured, no harm will come to you. You'll be well looked after by Dr. Coles. \nLEOPOLD Dr. Coles...? I do not follow. What do you mean, get me back home?... Where am I? \nAwkward pause. Leopold looks carefully around the room for the first time: modern mechanical equipment, data shifting and changing, giant cooling devices, bright neon lighting. The doctors are silent. \nLEOPOLD Answer me!... (slowly) Would you have me believe... I am being detained, at present in the HEREAFTER?... The time to come? \nDR. PLODDER (carefully) It is the year nineteen hundred and ninety-five. \nLEOPOLD \nLeopold leaps up. The doctors follow him around the room. \nLEOPOLD You're insane! All of you! This is impossible! \nDR. PLODDER Leopold, calm down! \nLEOPOLD A voyage through time! What do you take me for? Did you bring me here by force? \nDR. DRAKE We're scientist, not seditionists. \nLEOPOLD (truly panicked) Let me out of here! I won't stand for this another moment! \nHe's out the door. \nINT. UNDERGROUND HALLWAY - DAY \nLeopold moves quickly, fearfully through the darkly lit hallway, the doctors close behind. \nKATE Leopold, wait! \nDR. KAU You don't know what you're doing. \nDR. PLODDER Just listen to what we have to say! \nIt is too late. Leopold throws open the door and runs upstairs. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nBlinding sunlight. Skyscrapers. Automobiles. Traffic lights. Road construction. Modern day pedestrians. Helicopters. Car alarms. Leopold stands frozen, overwhelmed, taking it all in. \nLEOPOLD \nThe doctors reach him. He collapses to the ground. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CAR - DAY \nKate and Dr. Kau talk quietly. Leopold, tightly holding onto his seat and the back door, gazes out the window in utter disbelief. \nKATE Squab. \nDR. KAU Squab? \nKATE I remember reading they ate a lot of squab. \nDR. KAU Squab... Do you have a squab? \nKATE (quietly. On the verge of panic) I don't know! \nDR. KAU Pull yourself together! (turning to Leopold) Are you all right back there? \nLeopold, trembling, gapes at the sights, every day sounds, magnified. Perspiration runs down the side of his face. Kate watches him in her rear view mirror. \n", "test2_id": 730, "test3_input": "KATE When did he leave? \nCHARLIE I don't know. An hour ago? He said he wanted to take a walk. \nKATE And you let him?? He's not allowed to go outside! \nCHARLIE Is he being punished? \nKATE We've got to find him! You stay here in case he finds his way back. And while you wait you'd better pray he's all right. If anything happens to him, anything at all, EVERYTHING we've worked for will have been destroyed. \nShe heads out the door. Charlie follows. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - EARLY EVENING \nCHARLIE Kate, calm down. \nKATE And YOU'LL be responsible. Understand? (she grabs her coat and purse) \nCHARLIE What's the big deal? Who is this guy? \nKate takes a LONG pause. \nKATE Leopold... is not really from Canada. \nEXT. KATE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - LATE AFTERNOON \nPeaceful. The sun sets. Pigeons rest on window sills. Suddenly: \nCHARLIE (V.O.) OH MY GOD!!! \nThe pigeons take flight. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - EVENING \nLeopold leaves Central Park profoundly lost. Looking both ways in the wrong direction, he crosses the street. SCREECHING brakes, HONKING horns, FURIOUS shouts with Leopold, horrified, caught in the middle. He makes it across shaking and dazed. A motorist pulls along side of him. \nWOMAN MOTORIST You stupid fucking son of a bitch. Next time I'll hit ya. Fucking moron. \nLeopold GAPES, appalled. A Hansom carriage slowly treads into Central Park. Leopold watches until it disappears. \nINT. KATE'S GREEN A.M.C. PACER - NIGHT \nKate drives slowly, searching for Leopold. Cars honk with mounting anger. \nCABBY What're ya waiting for lady? An invitation? \nKATE I'm sorry! I'm sorry! \nShe continues searching, trying hard to remain calm. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NIGHT \nHuge buildings. Neon lights flashing. Garbage in bundles. Calvin Klein Ads. In the center of it all, Leopold, jostled BADLY by the crowd, tipping his hat to all the ladies. He enters a deli. \nINT. DELI - NIGHT \nLeopold, appalled by the prices searches for money. He has none. \nLEOPOLD (to the counter man) $7.95 for a sandwich? Is that correct? \nCOUNTER MAN You gotta problem with that? \nLEOPOLD It seems rather pricey to me. \nCOUNTER MAN So don't buy one. \nLEOPOLD I shan't. \nCOUNTER MAN So shan't! \nHe moves on. \nLEOPOLD Yes, I... I would be happy to sample one however I'm afraid I haven't the finance with me just now. If I could establish a credit with you, I will have someone come round with the funds tomorrow. \nCOUNTER MAN You will gladly pay me Tuesday for a hamburger today, is that it? \nLEOPOLD (a little confused) I believe so. Yes. \nCOUNTER MAN Get the fuck outta here. \nLEOPOLD I beg your pardon? \nCOUNTER MAN Get out. Fuckin' Wimpys piss me off. \n", "test3_true": "YUPPIE WOMAN You tell him. \nLEOPOLD Need I add that without our patronage you would not own that unwashed counter behind which you spew your filthy mouth? \nCOUNTER MAN Where do you get off? You don't even have any money. \nLEOPOLD Don't be irrelevant... I'm browsing. \nCOUNTER MAN Not in my store you're not. \nHe comes out from behind the counter. He's big. \nLEOPOLD (very superior) Do you intend to physically escort me out...? \nEXT. STREET - NIGHT \nLeopold is thrown out of the store and on to the street. \nLEOPOLD Did you see what he did? Did you see that? \nNo one responds. Leopold is left sprawled on the street. Thunder is heard. \nEXT. N.Y.C. - NIGHT \nGargoyles at New York City Library, The Dakota, the Bowery, Alphabet City. \nEXT. CLAIRMOUNT STABLES - 4 A.M. \nPouring rain. Leopold stands in front of the stables beaten and drenched. A car drives by, screeches to a stop, and hastily backs up along side Leopold. \nKATE Leopold! Leopold, get in. \nLeopold stares at the car. Kate runs out, opens the door and helps him in. She dashes back into the drivers seat. \nINT. CAR - 4 A.M. \nKATE (nearly in tears, trying to dry him off) Leopold! Oh, Leopold thank God you're all right. I didn't think I'd ever find you. You had us all so worried. Oh, Leopold! \nShe hits him hard. \nKATE Don't you ever go out again without my permission, do you hear me? I was frantic. You could have been killed a hundred times over. I never would have known. \nShe rests her head on the steering wheel, exhausted. She pulls herself together and looks at him. \nKATE Leopold, are you all right? \nLEOPOLD (looking deep into her eyes for the first time) I wish to go home. \nKATE Okay. I'll get you home in a jiffy. \nLEOPOLD (badly shaken) No... I wish to go home. \nKate gently observes Leopold who stares rigidly straight ahead. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT \nCHARLIE (on the phone) I don't know. It's just Leopold. Like Cher. Or Goofy. \nKate and Leopold walk in wet and exhausted. \nCHARLIE Never mind they just walked in. Jesus. You look horrible. \nKATE Charlie, don't start. I haven't been this angry at you since you got me into that pyramid thing last year. If you make a wisecrack I'm going to burst into flame. \nCHARLIE It wasn't a wisecrack. You do look horrible. \nKATE I'm too tired for this now. I'll just save it up and kill you tomorrow. Help Leopold out of his things and lets get him to bed. \nLEOPOLD I've something to say. To the both of you. I... Nothing is what it seems. After witnessing mere weeks of this age it is painfully apparent I am outside of my acquaintance... I don't know how to proceed. I frankly... am in need of assistance. I'm sorry. I'm not very good at this. In the event you have missed it, I am apologizing. \nThere is a long pause. \nCHARLIE About time. (he shakes Leopold's hand reluctantly) Welcome back. (he leaves) \nKATE Don't mind him. His heart would be in the right place if he had a heart. Surliness runs in my family. \nLEOPOLD I understand. It practically races through mine. \nKATE (shocked) Leopold, you made a joke. I mean one that's not at my expense. That's good. \nThey look at each other just a second too long. \n", "test3_id": 731}

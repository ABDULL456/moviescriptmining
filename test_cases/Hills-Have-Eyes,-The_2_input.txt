DOUG (CONT'D) (staring to the lifeless

DOUG I hope he's enjoying himself. On his knees, by the SUV tires, Big Bob inspects under the vehicle... Not only are the tires flattened, but the front axel has buckled from hitting the rocks. 
BIG BOB 
(TO ETHEL) How am I supposed to drive with you talking my ear off? I'm pulling a trailer on a dirt road and it's 200 degrees out here! Behind him, Ethel walks with the baby who has stopped crying.

DOUG What are we going to do? Without answering, Big Bob gets back on his feet, wipes his hands and grabs a bottle of water from the car. After a long

BIG BOB We're going to walk, that's what... 
DOUG Walk?! But we're miles from 
ANYWHERE- 
BIG BOB (cutting him off) So we wait here for someone to drive by? Have you seen a car in the last three hours?!

FURTHER AWAY- 
ETHEL I bet this desert is full of rattlesnakes...

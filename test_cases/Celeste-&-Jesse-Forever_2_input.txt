98 EXT. RUNYON CANYON-MORNING 98 
Celeste is hiking alone on the phone, energized. 
CELESTE Tweens don't want her anymore. But the gays do! Ten percent of Americans are gay, Scott. You're gay, start thinking gay. Gay Izod. She could be Lady Gaga by the end of the year. Huge market. 
SCOTT Wow, you might have just turned the cock in the butt around. 
CELESTE We WILL make the cock in the butt work for us. The cock in the butt will be huge! 
Just then, a mom and two small children walk by her, overhear her dirty mouth and glare at her. She waves at them self- consciously.

Celeste is shopping for a dresser. She is talking to a salesperson. 
SALESMAN So, it comes with directions and it's actually really easy to assemble. 
CELESTE Look, you do not know me. I do not want to assemble. Trust me, you do not want me to assemble. Bad things happen. Could I just take the floor model? I'll hook you up. 
SALESMAN Lemme go ask my manager. 
CELESTE Thanks, dude. 
Celeste is browsing and spots Veronica with a shopping cart filled with baby stuff. She approaches her. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) Veronica? Hey, Celeste. 
VERONICA Of course, yeah, hi! What are you doing? 
CELESTE Oh, I'm getting a dresser. You? 
VERONICA Oh, you know getting... 
VERONICA (CONT'D) CELESTE Baby stuff. Baby stuff. 
VERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD) Beth is uh...throwing me a baby shower? So I have to register. 
CELESTE She is? 
Celeste swallows this. 
CELESTE (CONT'D) (CONTD) That's uh...really nice. 
VERONICA Very. And so helpful right now. 
CELESTE Of course. (laughs nervously) Well, looks like you're really organized. 
VERONICA Organized, terrified. 
CELESTE You'll do great. 
VERONICA Thanks. I hope so. 
They share an awkward moment. 
VERONICA (CONT'D) (CONTD) Listen, I never got a chance to just tell you I'm so sorry about all this. Trust me, I didn't expect... 
CELESTE No, don't. Really. There's nothing to apologize for. I'm the one who's sorry. I mean, I dug through your trash. 
Celeste laughs. 
VERONICA Look, I don't blame you. For anything. This has all been so weird. Everything happened really fast. 
CELESTE Yeah, it did. But everything will work out. I know it. Jesse's book is coming out... 
VERONICA He's so talented. 
A beat. 
CELESTE Yeah, he is.

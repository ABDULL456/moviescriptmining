Todd is lead up the steps to Mr. Nolan's office by Hager. 
INT. NOLAN'S OFFICE - DAY 
Todd enters the room to see his mother and father seated opposite Mr. Nolan's desk. 
MR. ANDERSON Hello, son. 
MRS. ANDERSON Hello, darling. 
TODD Mom. 
THe door closes behind Todd. He remains standing, not knowing what to do. 
MR. NOLAN Have a seat, Mr. Anderson. 
Todd sits down next to his parents. 
MR. NOLAN Mr. Anderson, I think we've pretty well put together what's happened here. You do admit to being a part of this Dead Poets Society? 
Todd says nothing. 
MR. ANDERSON Answer him, Todd. 
TODD Yes, sir. 
Mr. Nolan puts his glasses on and glances at a paper before him before removing his glasses once more. 
MR. NOLAN I have here a detailed description of what occurred at your meetings. It describes how your teacher, Mr. Keating, encouraged you boys to organize this club and to use it as a source of inspiration for reckless and self- indulgent behavior. It describes how Mr. Keating, both in and out of the classroom, encouraged Neil Perry to follow his obsession with acting when he knew all along it was against the explicit order of Neil's parents. It was Mr. Keating's blatant abuse of his position as teacher that led directly to Neil Perry's death. 
Mr. Nolan motions to Todd's father, who passes along a sheet of paper to Todd. 
MR. NOLAN Read that document carefully, Todd. Very carefully. 
Todd looks at the paper, which already contains the signatures of the other four boys. 
MR. NOLAN If you've nothing to add or amend, sign it. 
TODD What's gonna happen to Mr. Keating? 
MR. ANDERSON I've had enough. Sign the paper, Todd. 
Mr. Nolan holds out a pen for Todd to take. 
EXT. CAMPUS - DAY 
Mr. McAllister leads his students, textbooks in hand, through the snow outside the classrooms. 
McALLISTER Grass is gramen or herba. Lapis is stone. The entire building is aedificium. 
Keating looks out from his office window. McAllister pauses and looks up at Keating, giving him a brief wave. Keating waves back. 
INT. KEATING'S OFFICE - DAY 
Keating laughs slightly as he watches McAllister from the window. Inside, all his belongings have been packed up. 
INT. KEATING'S CLASSROOM - DAY 
The students are all seated at their desks in silence. Everyone looks as the door opens. They quickly stand as Mr. Nolan enters the room. 
MR. NOLAN Sit. 
The students sit once again as Mr. Nolan walks to the front of the room. 
MR. NOLAN I'll be teaching this class through exams. We'll find a permanent English teacher during the break. Who will tell me where you are in the Pritchard textbook? 
MR. NOLAN Mr. Anderson? 
TODD Uh, in the, in the Pr- 
MR. NOLAN I can't hear you, Mr. Anderson. 
TODD In the, in the, in the Pritchard? 
MR. NOLAN Kindly inform me, Mr. Cameron. 
CAMERON We skipped around a lot, sir. We covered the Romantics and some of the chapters on Post Civil War literature.

DIRECTOR V/O Prem? Tone it down, for goodness sake. You're making him a laughing stock. 
Prem glances up at the gallery with contempt. 
PREM We're having fun here. They love it...Where the hell do you get them from? 
He makes no attempt to hide the conversation from Jamal. 
DIRECTOR V/O It's supposed to be a quiz show, not a blood sport. 
FLOOR MANAGER Two minutes. 
(CONTINUED) 
38   CONTINUED: (2)                                             38 
PREM Stop wetting your pants. I'll be a good little boy with the next one. Promise. 
He chucks the head-phones back at the Floor Manager. Glances in the wings. Sees Nita, the make-up woman. Gets up and goes over. 
39   INT. STUDIO. BACKSTAGE. NIGHT.                             39 
In the half-light, backstage, Nita dabs his face with powder. 
PREM Meet me after the show. Please. 
NITA No. 
PREM Nita, I can explain. 
NITA No need. I read it in bloody Stardust. Didn't even have the balls to tell me. "Prem's happiness with another baby on the way". After everything you said... 
PREM Baby, it all happened before I met you. I swear to you. 
NITA She's got the gestation period of an elephant, then. 
Prem is about to object. But instead, he laughs. 
PREM You see? Amidst all this misery, only you can make me laugh. 
Scornful but hints of melting. 
NITA All this misery... 
PREM Her and I- nothing. You have to believe me, baby... 
Nita turns away. The Floor Manager comes over. 
FLOOR MANAGER One minute. (CONTINUED) 
39   CONTINUED:                                                39 
Prem slings himself in a chair. 
PREM No. I'm not going on. 
NITA Prem... 
PREM I can't. Without you, it's all pointless. 
Clicks his fingers at the Floor Manager. 
PREM (CONT'D) You. Tell the Director. 
Nita shakes her head at the Floor Manager who by now is looking very worried. 
FLOOR MANAGER Thirty seconds. 
Prem shrugs and folds his arms. Sees her weaken. 
NITA Prem... 
PREM Calypso Bar, private room, just you and me? 
FLOOR MANAGER Fifteen. 
NITA (furious) Alright. 
He grins, jumps up, blows her a kiss, and stalks back on stage. 
40   INT. STUDIO. NIGHT.                                       40 
He sits back down, says almost to himself. 
PREM Steel balls. 
Turns to Jamal. 
PREM (CONT'D) Okay, Juhu boy, you've had a good run. Take your Mother to Khandala and eat some chiki. 
JAMAL My Mother's dead. (CONTINUED) 
40   CONTINUED:                                                40 
PREM Well, your girlfriend then. Even better. 
JAMAL I don't have a girl-friend. 
PREM Live wire like you? You surprise me.

Alice shakes her head and gently strokes the dolphin. 
ALICE It's through her lung. 
Skipper turns to Phil. 
SKIPPER (to Phil) Nice shot. 
Phil looks up at the crew but one by one they look away. Chuck finds this confusing and inexcusable but is the last to look away.  Skipper grimly walks over to one of the deck lockers and pulls out a large wooden mallet and holds it out to Phil. 
SKIPPER Finish it. 
Phil looks at the mallet, horrified. 
PHIL (stammering) I'm not gonna kill it. 
SKIPPER You already have.  Now go on.  Do it. 
Phil backs away.  Skipper stares at him for a moment, then walks over to the dolphin.  Robin looks away.  The sickening sound of the mallet crushing the skull of the animal seems to silence the world.  There are one of two thumps of her tail and, it's over. 
Skipper tosses the bloody mallet into the locker and approaches Phil, his face flushed with anger.  He grabs the spear gun, and snaps it across his knee and throws the pieces into the sea. 
SKIPPER What the hell is wrong with you?! 
Phil begins to shake with rage. 
SKIPPER Come on.  You got so much fight in you; you wanna kill something?  Take your best shot.  The first one's free. 
Robin holds his ears as if he can make it all go away. For a brief moment Phil looks as if he might take Skipper up on the challenge.  Then the impulse passes. 
SKIPPER That's what I thought. (beat) You're done.  You're going home. 
Skipper turns.  The humiliation is more than Phil can take.  He lunges after Skipper.  Lawford grabs him.  Phil swings wildly. 
PHIL You mean-assed bastard!!  You son of a bitch!!  You can't do this!!!  You can't do this!!!  God damn you!! God damn you!! 
Lawford leads Phil, struggling, below.  The crew surround the dead dolphin, stunned. 
EXT.  ARUBA - ESTABLISHING - DAY 
The Albatross is at anchor in the center of the harbor. 
EXT.  DECK - SAME 
Phil comes on deck from below with his duffel bag. Everyone feels bad but no one knows what to say.  Phil turns to get a second load. 
CHUCK Why'd you do it? 
PHIL (regretting it) What's the difference? 
CHUCK You only hurt yourself you know? 
PHIL Like you really care.  Like any of you give a shit what happens to me. 
RICK You're the one who doesn't care, Phil. 
PHIL It hurts too much to care. 
RICK About yourself? 
PHIL About anything. 
Phil turns and disappears down the companionway. 
ROBIN We shouldn't be putting him off the boat. 
CHRIS The guy's out of control. 
ROBIN Everybody's been outta control on this trip. (beat) Are we a crew or not?  I mean, isn't that what this is supposed to be all about? 
MIKE You're the last person who should be whining about being a "crew". 
ROBIN How do you figure that? 
MIKE Well, I'd sure like to go into the subject of vertigo and all, but I wouldn't want you to piss yourself. 
Robin flushes bright red.  John fires a look at Mike. 
JOHN You're a regular prick you know that? 
MIKE Tell it to the dolphin, Goodall. 
JOHN Everybody deserves a second chance, ya know?  We'd do the same for you Mike. 
ROBIN It's about family isn't it?  I mean are we together on this or not? 
There is a long pause.  Mike and Chris cave. 
MIKE Hell, do what ever you want.  It won't change anything anyway. 
Robin exchanges a glance with Chuck and together, they climb up the companionway. 
EXT.  CHART HOUSE - SAME 
Chuck and Robin stand before the door. 
ROBIN I can't go in there. 
CHUCK What are you talking about. 
Robin turns away, ashamed.

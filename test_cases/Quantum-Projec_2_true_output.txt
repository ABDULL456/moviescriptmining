PENTCHO Yes.  (beat) Yes I can. 
50     EXT.  ALEXANDER'S HOUSE - NIGHT                         50 
Pentcho turns the key, effortlessly opens the front door. 
INT.  UPSTAIRS HOUSE - AN ORNATE TILE SHOWER - NIGHT 
He stands beneath the stream of hot water, cleansing himself of a day that began a very long time ago. 
INT.  THE GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT 
Pentcho dresses, taking in the smell and texture of fresh clothes against his body.  He sits down on the bed.  Sees a clock.  5:00 a.m. TUGS UP one of the double sash windows that faces the 7-Eleven. VOICES rise from the parking lot. 
Pentcho stretches out on the musty bedspread, eyes on the carved plaster ceiling.  Suddenly, floating up through the open window: 
WOMAN'S VOICE What do you want?! 
Pentcho cranes his head. 
WOMAN'S VOICE (CONT'D) Tell me!  Now!  Now!

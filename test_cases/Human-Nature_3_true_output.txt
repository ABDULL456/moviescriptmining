Puff walks along. He is still followed by reporters. Cows watch the parade. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FOREST - EVENING 
Puff walks along a dirt road. He is about to disappear into the forest. An older woman rushes out from the crowd. 
OLDER WOMAN Wait! 
PUFF (turning) Yes? 
OLDER WOMAN I saw you on C-Span. I've been looking for you for thirty years. Then there you were, such a beautiful, beautiful grown man. 
The older woman starts to cry. 
PUFF Mother? 
OLDER WOMAN Yes... Derek. 
Puff holds out his hand for her to shake. Flashbulbs flash. 
PUFF (formally) It's a pleasure to meet you, mother. But I'm an ape like dad was... (checks watch) And I have to go back into the woods now... forever. 
OLDER WOMAN (resigned) Yes, I suppose so. I suppose I knew that was going to be what you would say. It's good to see you again though. 
PUFF Yes. 
OLDER WOMAN I'm in the book, if you ever want to drop me a line or something. 
PUFF I'm an ape, mom. I'm an ape. And apes don't drop lines. 
His mother weeps. Puff gently rests his hand on her shoulder for a moment, then he turns and waves to the reporters. The crowd bursts into applause. Flashbulbs flash. Puff jogs into the woods. There is a collective sigh, and then everyone turns and heads back in the direction from which they came. We hold on the woods for a moment. A car pulls up. Puff hurries out of the woods and jumps in the passenger side of the car. 
CUT TO: 
INT. CAR - CONTINUOUS 
Puff leans over and kisses Gabrielle, who is driving the car. 
GABRIELLE Hello, my little boy. 
PUFF Hey, ma. Did you bring any clothes? I'm freezing my ass off. 
GABRIELLE Oui. Nathan's silk suit, just like you asked. 
PUFF Great. (putting on suit) God, I've wanted you forever. 
Gabrielle giggles. Puff kisses her. 
GABRIELLE Say my name. 
PUFF Gabrielle. 
GABRIELLE (eyes glistening) You remind me so much of Nathan. 
PUFF Like father, like son. 
GABRIELLE (stroking his face) You remind me so much of Nathan plus so much of my little mongrel doggie. 
PUFF Woof. 
This turns Gabrielle on. She kisses him passionately. When the kiss runs its course, Puff speaks. 
PUFF Arf. 
Gabrielle kisses him again, even more passionately this time 
PUFF As much as I loved Nathan, I'm not sorry she killed him, if it means I can have you. Is that a terrible thing to say, my sweet? 
GABRIELLE (putting her finger to his lips) Hush. No, it is never terrible to be in love. Nathan's memory lives on in our sacred union. (beat) I'm not sorry she killed him either. Nathan was wonderful. He was erudite and sophisticated and charming. You are all that, too. But you have something more. You have a bit of the animal in you. 
They smile flirtatiously at each other. Puff leans over and kisses Gabrielle's neck.

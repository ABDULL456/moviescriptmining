{"train": "ANALYZE THAT \nScreenplay by PETER STEINFELD and HAROLD RAMIS and PETER TOLAN \nBased on characters created by KENNETH LONERGAN and PETER TOLAN \nJune 2002 Draft \nFOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES ONLY \nFADE IN: \nINT. DIMLY-LIT BAR - NIGHT \nTwo men, CAESAR and MARTY \"DUCKS,\" stand at  the   end of the deserted bar, talking quietly, oblivious to  the   exotic dancer grinding her pelvis on a pole in the middle  of   the small stage. Body language and charisma tell us   that   Caesar is the boss, \"Ducks\" his lieutenant. DUCKS It's Peezee. Gotta be.    He hates your fuckin' guts. CAESAR (brooding) I don't know. DUCKS Who else knew about the money? And how did Peezee know they popped Tony Cisco when we didn't even hear about it 'til last night? CAESAR (sighs heavily) I don't know. DUCKS (pressing) What is so hard to understand here? You said yourself Peezee was a mamaluke and you couldn't trust him. Now suddenly you're soft on the guy? CAESAR I just don't think it was him. DUCKS Okay, I'll bite. If not Peezee, then who? CAESAR (slowly rising to his full height) I think it was you, Ducks. Caesar starts to walk away as the bartender, now holding a sawed-off shotgun, moves closer to Ducks. The exotic dancer splits in a hurry through a curtain at the back of the stage. DUCKS (scared) You gotta be kiddin'! Caesar stops at the door where two of his soldiers have \nappeared, holding AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. DUCKS Caesar, you know me! What kind of fuckin' idiot would I have to be to try that shit with you? CAESAR A dead fuckin' idiot. As he walks out the door, the soldiers OPEN FIRE on Marty \"Ducks.\" Caesar doesn't look back. \nstill seated in the front row, daydreaming. The RINGING CONTINUES as all the mourners and even the Rabbi discreetly check their cell phones. \nThen Ben realizes it's his, fumbles for the phone in his jacket pocket and answers it. BEN (whispers) Hello? The mourners mutter. \nCUT TO: INT. PRISON PAY PHONE - SAME TIME VITTI Guess who, you fuck! INTERCUT WITH: \nINT. CHAPEL Ben turns away from Laura. \nBEN Paul? (to Laura) I have to, uh, take this. (into phone) This isn't a good time. Vitti is disheveled, his hair messed, his shirt buttoned wrong. VITTI Not a good time? Let me explain something to you. I'm in fucking Hell right now. This is not a good time. BEN (sotto voce) I can't talk right now.     My father died! VITTI So what does that have to do with me? BEN Call me later -- VITTI Don't hang up on, Sobel!    They're tryin' to kill me! \nBen hangs up. CUT BACK TO: \nVITTI He stands there for a long beat just staring, the DIAL TONE BUZZING in his ear. CUT TO: INT. SING SING - MESS HALL - NEXT DAY \nVitti and another WISEGUY pass through the cafeteria line with their trays. Vitti now looks catatonic. WISEGUY #2 Ooh, they got tapioca. I love tapioca. (looks at Vitti) You all right, Paul? Vitti just stares, wild-eyed, actually drooling a little. WISEGUY #2 Can I have your tapioca? \nA guard, the one who tried to kill him, watches Vitti from his post. Then he nods to someone across the room. COYOTE, a heavily-muscled and tattooed gang member, nods in response. Vitti walks past the table where Coyote is sitting with other tough Hispanic gang members. COYOTE (to Vitti) Hey, Fredo! Or is it Guido? His friends laugh. Vitti stops and stares dumbly at them. COYOTE Just keep walkin', Don Corleone. There is a tense moment, then Vitti bursts out laughing. COYOTE Shut up! Vitti laughs harder, strangely manic. COYOTE I said, shut up, bitch! \nseemed to have some kind of breakdown. BEN What kind of breakdown? \nMILLER I think you'd better go up there and see for yourself. CUT TO: INT. SING SING INFIRMARY - PSYCH WARD - DAY \nVitti huddles in the corner of a bare, white, padded cell, rocking, completely out of his head. VITTI (singing) 'I feel pretty, oh, so pretty, I feel pretty and witty and bright...' \nINT. OBSERVATION ROOM - SAME TIME Ben watches through a two-way mirror with the prison psychiatrist, DR. CUTLER. They can hear Vitti through a wall-mounted speaker. \nDR. CUTLER I'm treating him with Thioridazine, 300 milligrams, T.I.D. That seems to keep him pretty calm. BEN (watching Vitti) That would keep a parade pretty calm. He just keeps singing West Side Story songs? DR. CUTLER 'Tonight,' 'Maria,' the balcony scene. BEN The balcony scene?   Both parts? DR. CUTLER Oh, yeah. Get him to do 'Officer Krupke.' It's really good. \nINT. PADDED CELL Ben and Dr. Cutler enter.   Vitti doesn't seem to notice. VITTI (singing) 'Who's the pretty girl in the mirror \nthere? What mirror? Where?       Who can that attractive girl be?' BEN Paul, it's me.    Ben Sobel.   Paul? (beat) Maria? VITTI Tony? BEN (with a look to Dr. Cutler) Oh, boy. (to Vitti) What's going on, Maria? VITTI The rumble -- it's tonight! I have to get out of here. I don't want to die. No, Chino, no! Vitti's jaw suddenly goes slack and he slumps in his seat, staring forward. BEN Paul?   Paul? Ben waves a hand in front of Vitti's face.       Nothing. DR. CUTLER This is how it's been. He sings for a while, then he goes completely catatonic. BEN (skeptical) Really. Can we take him to an examining room? DR. CUTLER Of course. CUT TO: INT. EXAMINING ROOM - MINUTES LATER Vitti sits inert on the examination table. BEN You already did a neurological work- up? DR. CUTLER Yep. No tumors, no aneurisms, no sign of stroke -- \nBen slaps Vitti's face lightly a couple times. BEN Completely catatonic -- He pulls on Vitti's ears and nose.     Vitti does not react. BEN Totally gone. Well, I don't think he's smart enough to be faking. Street smart, yes, but we're talking about an I.Q. just north of a bedroom slipper. Ben checks Vitti out of the corner of his eye. No reaction. Then Ben takes a sharp needle from an instrument tray. BEN So if I just stuck him with this needle, he probably wouldn't even respond. DR. CUTLER I don't know.    Try it. Ben hesitates for a moment to see if Vitti will crack, then \nBEN Okay -- He sticks the needle into Vitti's shoulder. VITTI (bursts into song) 'Boy, boy, crazy boy, keep cool, boy! Got a rocket in your pocket, keep cool-y cool boy -- ' CUT TO: INT. SING SING - CONSULTATION ROOM - NEXT DAY Vitti is sitting at a table facing Ben.     Dr. Cutler observes from a chair in the corner. BEN Paul, we're going to    give you some tests to assess your    mental condition. There's no pressure    -- just answer as best you can. Do I     have your consent to share the results    of these tests? VITTI Mommy's mad at me because I made a boom on the rug. \nVITTI (smirks) Trick question, right?    Both of 'em. CUT TO: ANOTHER TEST \nBEN Okay, Paul. Last test. In this one, I'm going to start a sentence and you complete it any way you want to. Ready? 'I get angry -- ' VITTI Yes. BEN No, you're supposed to complete the sentence. VITTI I did.   I said 'yes.' \nBEN I wasn't asking if you agreed or disagreed; it was more like, 'I get angry when -- ' VITTI -- whenever. BEN Well, that about does it for me. CUT TO: INT. U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE - DAY Ben meets with RICHARD CHAPIN, the U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of New York. BEN Based on his symptoms and the test results, I'd say brief psychotic disorder -- if it persists, possibly schizophreniform disorder. And Dr. Cutler agrees with my diagnosis. CHAPIN So he's crazy? \nBEN Dr. Cutler?   No, he's annoying, but -- CHAPIN Vitti. BEN Not crazy. At least not permanently. In certain people, continuous exposure to an extremely stressful situation -- soldiers in combat, for instance, disaster victims, a hostage situation, or being locked up in a maximum security prison with someone trying to kill you -- it can produce a temporary psychotic state. CHAPIN How temporary? BEN A day, a week, up to a month -- if the precipitating stressors are removed. CHAPIN (musing) Which means he's not going to get any better while he's still in the can. BEN He could get worse. He could deteriorate to the point where he'd be permanently schizophrenic. CHAPIN Then I'd say he's got a real problem, because he goes before the parole board in four weeks. BEN You think they'll let him out? CHAPIN Oh, yeah, I'm sure they'll want to release a major Mafia figure who's now totally deranged on top of it. BEN (thinks) Well, couldn't you release him to    a halfway house or some place where    he could get some decent treatment? Based on my earlier work with him,    I don't think he's dangerous, and I think he was making a real effort    to reform himself. \nCHAPIN You do, huh? (thinks for a long moment) Okay. Then I'll tell you what. I'm gonna release him into your custody. BEN Mine? Me? No, this is a bad time for me. My father just died -- and I've got this bulging disc in my neck -- and we're redecorating, which is a total nightmare. I can't -- CHAPIN You want to see him killed in prison? BEN No, of course not. CHAPIN Or sent to a facility for the criminally insane. BEN No -- \nCHAPIN Then he's all yours. I'm going to talk to the Bureau of Prisons and get you certified as a temporary federal institution. BEN (stricken) What?    I can't be an institution. CHAPIN (firm) You've got thirty days to get him in shape for his parole hearing. That means sane, sober and gainfully employed. But let me warn you, Doctor. If he fucks up in any way -- if he flees, or if I find out that this whole thing was just a setup so he could get back on the street and return to a life of crime -- I will hold you totally responsible, and I'll see that you are stripped of your license and prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Are we clear? BEN (gulp) Yes.    We're clear. \nCHAPIN You still want him? BEN (long beat to decide) Yes. CUT TO: EXT. SING SING - FEW DAYS LATER \nThe gate opens and Ben coaxes Vitti outside.     A guard watches them. BEN Okay, Paul -- this way. Vitti comes out carrying an overnight bag, walking like a zombie. Ben leads him over to the car and opens the door for him. Vitti keeps walking, passing the car. BEN This way, Paul. Over here.      Here we go. Ben helps Vitti into the car.     One of Vitti's legs is still outside. BEN Leg, Paul.   Leg up. Ben lifts Vitti's leg into the car and closes the door. CUT TO: INT. CAR - MOMENTS LATER Ben STARTS the CAR and pulls away with Vitti still slumped in his seat. Once out of sight of the prison, Vitti straightens and turns on Ben, suddenly lucid. VITTI (enraged) You fucking son-of-a-bitch! Where the fuck do you get off sticking me with a needle? BEN I knew it! I knew you were faking! You used me to get you out of prison! VITTI Took you long enough. I was singin' West Side Story for three fuckin' days. I'm half a fag already. \nBEN What are you talking about? VITTI I call you to say somebody's trying to kill me and you hang up on me? BEN I was at the funeral home! VITTI You're my fuckin' doctor! \nLAURA What? \nVITTI Somebody said something about coffee. LAURA That was you.    You said you wanted some. VITTI So what's the holdup? LAURA (to Ben) Why don't you make your friend some coffee. I'm going upstairs to take a long bath and hopefully drown. Laura smiles at the two men, then exits. BEN You'll have to forgive her.     She's usually a great hostess. VITTI I understand. She's uncomfortable. The whole situation's a little awkward with me bein' here -- but let's face it, Emily fuckin' Post she's not. BEN Emily fuckin' Post. Well, that explains why she rarely used her middle name. VITTI Listen, I got a friend coming over.     I didn't want you to be surprised. BEN What    kind of friend? Because if it's 'The    Wrench,' or 'The Power Drill' or any    other kind of tool    -- VITTI Not that kind of friend.     It's a personal thing. BEN They won't stay late, will they? VITTI (stares at him) Are you really that pussy-whipped? \nBEN I'm not -- this has nothing to do with Laura. \nVITTI I heard her busting your balls. BEN We were having a disagreement. A certain amount of conflict is normal in a marriage. \nVITTI Or? BEN Or what? VITTI Or you're pussy-whipped. BEN Paul -- VITTI Good night, Whippy. \nBEN (calls after him) Remember, this is only temporary. VITTI Oh, really? I didn't hear you the tenth fuckin' time. He exits. CUT TO: INT. UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER Ben knocks on Michael's door and walks in without waiting to be asked. CUT TO: INT. MICHAEL'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION Michael is sitting up in bed reading. BEN (oblivious) Mike, can we talk for a second? MICHAEL Sure.     What? \nBEN I know the last few weeks have been kind of tough with Grandpa -- dying and everything -- and it might've felt to you like I didn't have time for you or I didn't care about how you feel. MICHAEL No, it didn't. BEN Good. Because I want you to know that you can talk to me about stuff and that I can really listen and understand what you're going through. MICHAEL I do, Dad. BEN And if I seemed a little hard on Grandpa, it's just that your grandfather was a hard man in a lot of ways. He wanted everything done his way and sometimes I just felt like nothing I ever did was good enough. I don't want it to be that way with us. MICHAEL It's not. BEN And you know, at times like this we all might start questioning our own mortality and you might be thinking how devastated you'd be if I died. Right? MICHAEL No.   Not really. BEN That's good. Good talk. And I realize it's all a little hectic right now, but this Paul Vitti thing is only temporary, okay? MICHAEL Oh, really? I didn't hear you the tenth fuckin' time. BEN That's not funny.   Good night, Michael. \nMICHAEL Good night, Whippy. \nBen exits, shaking his head. The moment he's gone, the rumpled blankets next to Michael shift, and a CUTE, PUNKY 16-YEAR-OLD GIRL emerges from hiding under the comforter. CUTE GIRL I gotta get home. What was that about? MICHAEL I have no idea. Parenting stuff. CUT TO: EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - NIGHT The suburban street is dark and quiet and all the lights are off in the house. WOMAN (V.O.) Ohhhhh!   Ohhhhh, Paul! \nVITTI I think you're jealous. BEN Oh, yeah, I'm really jealous. VITTI I didn't hear nothin' comin' out of your room. BEN We don't think it's necessary to wake the neighbors every time we have sex. \nVITTI Hey, if you're really quiet, you might be able to do it without even wakin' up your wife. SHEILA (O.S.) (moaning) Ohhh.   Ohhh. Ben looks curiously at Vitti. VITTI I told her if I wasn't back in two minutes to start without me. I gotta go. Vitti heads back upstairs. BEN This is not a good start, Paul. CUT TO: INT. DINING AREA - NEXT MORNING Laura and Ben are hosting a brunch for the out-of-town relatives. Laura offers a basket of bagels to a seated, older woman. \nLAURA Aunt Ester, I'm so sorry we had to put you up at the hotel. We wanted you here with us, but we had an unexpected house guest. She glares at Ben. AUNT ESTHER (sighs) Your father always had room for us. \nBEN I'm sorry. (mutters to Laura) Next time I lose a parent, I'll be sure to reserve the guest room. A DOOR SLAMS somewhere, then Sheila storms into the room sobbing, her hair askew, tucking her blouse into her skirt. SHEILA (screaming) Go to hell, Paul! You just go to hell! \nVITTI (O.S.) Go ahead! Get out of here, you crazy fuckin' whore. Vitti charges into the room, his robe open. From the reactions of everyone in the room, it's clear he's not wearing anything under it. VITTI Go back to turning tricks in Jersey for all I fuckin' care. Sheila exits and slams the front door.   Vitti sees everyone staring at him. He closes his robe. VITTI How's it goin'? (sees buffet) Oh, we got food. Good. Vitti heads for the buffet. LAURA (smiling) Ben? BEN (quickly) Paul? \nVitti bellies up to the buffet, stepping between an older couple. He eyes the food disdainfully. VITTI Oh, great. Jew food. Who do you have to fuck to get some bacon around here? The woman reacts in horror. VITTI Not you, I'm guessing. \nBEN (snags Vitti's arm) Why don't we go to my office?   I'll make you a plate. CUT TO: INT. BEN'S OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER Ben and Vitti enter.   Vitti still in his robe. VITTI What is it with your relatives?   They tend to overreact quite a bit. \nBEN I know. All you did was flash everybody in the dining room. VITTI So? From the look of 'em, some of those broads haven't seen the old salcicc' in a long time. It's good for them. BEN Well, when the paramedics revive my Aunt Goldie, I'll be sure to ask her. Sit. Vitti starts for Ben's chair. BEN Ah ah ah! He points Vitti to the sofa and takes his own chair. BEN So what are you going to do, Paul? VITTI What do you mean? BEN With your life. \nVITTI First I'm gonna find out who's tryin' to kill me. I'm a target. Somebody could shoot right through that window -- blow my fuckin' head off. Ben sees that he's in the line of fire, gets up and moves out of the way. \nVITTI I lived in East Harlem! I joined a street gang when I was 12 and that was it. BEN Something else happened when you were twelve. VITTI What? BEN (prompting) Something that made you very sad? VITTI The Dodgers moved from Brooklyn to L.A. Everybody took it pretty hard. BEN Something else. VITTI We playin' a guessing game here? BEN Paul! Your father was murdered! Right in front of you. Remember? VITTI Do I remember? I think about it every fuckin' day of my life. What's that got to do with it? BEN It's got everything   to do with it. He gave you the cowboy   suit. With a white hat. He was    in the mob, but he wanted you to be a   good guy, didn't he? Vitti starts thinking about his father and starts to weep. \nVITTI Yeah.   He did. BEN He didn't want you in the gang life. He only did it himself so you wouldn't have to. He was trying to buy you a better life than his. VITTI (crying harder) He always said he wanted me to go to college. I didn't even finish high school. He really starts sobbing now. BEN Well, Paul, this could be a  great opportunity for you. You're   right back where you were when you  were twelve. You've got some big   choices to make. Vitti fights to regain control. VITTI Okay.   Okay.   That's enough of that shit. BEN It's not shit, Paul. My point is, when you're a child, you think anything is possible. Wouldn't it be great to think like that now? VITTI (retreating back into his cynicism) Yeah, just sprinkle some fuckin' fairy dust on me. BEN I'm just saying you've got to keep an open mind and explore some new possibilities. Try some different things -- maybe you'll connect with one of them. There's a career counselor I work with. I can call him for you. He may be able to help you find a job. VITTI You mean working for somebody? I'm supposed to take orders from some guy who used to get me coffee? (starts sweating and \nbreathing hard) I can't do that. It's not right. It's not me. \nBEN How do you know unless you try? Suddenly one of the WINDOWS behind Vitti SHATTERS. Ben dives for cover. Silence -- then another RAP on the window. Ben looks out and sees JELLY in the back yard, tossing stones at the window. \nJELLY (calls out) Hiya, Doc. Sorry about the window. Ben waves him around to the side door. CUT TO: INT. DINING AREA - MOMENTS LATER Jelly is loading up a plate of food from the buffet, talking to the elderly relatives. Laura stares at him. JELLY I love  lox and bagels. I dated a Jewish  woman once. Actually, she might  have been the love of my life, but my  mother broke it up. JELLY (CONT'D) She was always hockin' me a chinick about the madels. A wonderful woman, my mother, but she fuckin' hates the Hebes. LAURA Really. (noting mountain of food on his plate) More smoked salmon? Don't be shy. Ben enters. BEN Jelly -- what are you doing here? JELLY Makin' new friends. How's it going, Doc? I brought some clothes for Mr. Vitti. LAURA (indicating the door) Ben? \nBEN That's great, Jelly. I'd love to catch up with you -- outside. \nJELLY (rising) You got it. (to Laura) Thanks, Mrs. S. (to others) So long, everybody.    Ess gesunterhait. \nJelly and Ben exit. CUT TO: EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER Ben and Jelly walk out to the driveway where Jelly's Buick is parked. JELLY So. Long time no see.     You look good, Doc. BEN (trying to be pleasant) And you, Jelly -- you look -- (can't find words for how he looks) Did you get a haircut? I thought you were in prison. JELLY It would appear not. BEN How'd you get out? JELLY New trial. The evidence in my first trail was, you know, tainted. Turns out two of the witnesses against me changed their minds -- and the third one, he died after a short illness. BEN What did he have? JELLY Gunshot wound to the head. BEN That's not an illness. \nJELLY Yeah, but it is short. Vitti, now dressed, comes out of the house and crosses to the car. BEN (to Vitti) Where are you going? VITTI I got stuff to do. \npulling his torso out of the river. It's hard. VITTI I'll bet -- especially with all the talk about you being the one who put him there. PATTY That's why I try not to gossip, Paul. It's ugly. Just a sec. (screaming to ceiling) Michelle! Teresa! It's ten-thirty! Stop fucking around and get ready for ballet! (to Vitti) It's hard being a single parent and a career woman. VITTI Yeah, I'm sure you're very busy. PATTY The pressure -- it's awful. For instance, a lot of people think, now that you're out, you're going to try and take the family back from me. But I said, no, Paul would never do that. (smiling) By the way, how are Marie and the kids? Still in Ohio? In Shaker Heights? At 1356 Locust? Vitti explodes, reaches across the counter and grabs her by the shoulders. VITTI (enraged) You even go near them, you crazy bitch PATTY (quietly) Don't make me call my guys in. You may need the shit kicked out of you, but not in here. I just mopped. Vitti lets her go. PATTY (smoothing clothes, flushed and a little excited) Wow.   Have you been working out? VITTI Yeah, I been workin' out who's trying \nto kill me. I'd love to hear your thoughts on that. PATTY It's a dog-eat-dog world out there. Nobody's gonna be safe unless we can end this thing with the Rigazzis. VITTI So then you didn't have nothin' to do with it. PATTY (hurt) Oh, Paul. You actually think I would kill you? All the years we've known each other -- the Christmas parties, the fun times at the beach. It wouldn't be right. I want us to be friends. (smiles demurely) Who knows? Maybe we'll be more than friends. Want to lick my beaters? She holds the beaters out to him. VITTI (declining) Thanks. I gotta see a guy about a business thing. PATTY What kind of business? You know, if you get something going, we would expect some kind of consideration -- a little taste. VITTI No, this is a legitimate business. PATTY (shudders) Oh, Paul. I just got a chill. VITTI I just want to be left alone.   Put my life back together -- straight  up this time. Put the word out, will   ya? Nobody's got nothin' to worry  about from me. PATTY Sure, Paul.    I understand. He heads for the door. \nPATTY (calls after him) Don't be a stranger! \nAfter Vitti leaves, Eddie enters from the other door. PATTY (turning to Eddie) Watch him like a hawk. If he steps out of line, it would break my heart, but shoot him in the fuckin' head. \nCUT TO: EXT. PARK AVENUE AUDI DEALERSHIP - LATER Vitti is trying to sell an $80,000 Audi to the MacINERNYS, an upscale middle-aged couple. Vitti opens the trunk. VITTI Look at the size of that trunk. You could fit three people in there. (off their shocked looks) Not people -- suitcases. It's a joke. \nThe MacInernys laugh uncertainly. VITTI So what are you driving now? MR. MacINERNY We have a Lexus. VITTI (nods) It's a fancy Toyota, right? The Japs make good cars, but I ain't that quick to forget Pearl Harbor. The MacInernys look doubtful. CUT TO: INT. MORETTI'S STEAK HOUSE - NIGHT A crowd of well-heeled New Yorkers surround Vitti at the captain's station. Vitti, the new host, greets a prominent sports figure who embraces him like an old friend. VITTI (signals the MAITRE D') Mario, put Mr. Torre at table five. JOEY BOOTS, an old acquaintance of Vitti's, enters with a couple of his cronies. \nJOEY BOOTS Paul, I heard you were out. \nVITTI Hey, Joey. JOEY BOOTS All dressed up for dinner, huh? VITTI Yeah. \nThe Maitre D' crosses away and waves at Vitti. MAITRE D' Paul, that table for six is ready. You can send them back. JOEY BOOTS You're working here? VITTI (dying) Nah -- not really. It's like -- I'm on parole, so I just -- I come in, I greet people. \nBACK TO VITTI VITTI (sweating) What am I -- Edison?    I'm telling you, it's a 'G.' He glances at the surveillance cameras. YOUNG MAN Can I look at it with a lens? CUT TO: \nFANTASY - SPRAY-PAINTING the camera lens and clipping the alarm wires. END FANTASY. \nBACK TO VITTI \nVITTI (completely distracted) What? FIANCEE A lens.    Do you have a lens? CUT TO: FANTASY - SAFE in the back as it BLOWS UP. END FANTASY. OWNER Ben's cousin, approaches Vitti who is now hyperventilating. \nOWNER Are you all right? VITTI I'm gonna do us both a big favor.    I quit. CUT BACK TO: INT. CAR DEALERSHIP - DAY The MacInernys are trembling. \nVITTI You want to see the manager? (grabs his crotch) Here's the manager. Now take a hike, you fuckin' deadbeats. The MacInernys rush out of the showroom. VITTI (calls after them) Get a Hyundai! CUT TO: \nDREAM SEQUENCE - INT. BEN'S OFFICE - NIGHT Vitti is on the sofa. He's wearing a shiny, silk, short- sleeved shirt with the sleeves turned up, tight, black chino pants and short, black, pointy-toed boots. His hair is oiled and coifed like early Frankie Avalon. VITTI (distraught) I can't deal with this shit. My grades suck, I'm gettin' in fights every day, and if I get suspended again my mother's gonna fuckin' kill me -- if the nuns don't kill me first. \nBEN is listening to Vitti, but dressed as Sigmund Freud. BEN (nodding) Eins, zwei, drei! VITTI What? VITTI'S MOTHER is sitting next to him. \nVITTI'S MOTHER (elbows him) Sit up straight! Pay attention when the doctor talks to you. This is costing money. Ben (Freud) has a large TAXI METER TICKING away beside him. VITTI Ma?   What are you doin' here? BEN (FREUD) (snorts some cocaine) Acht gemacht gehunden nicht. VITTI'S MOTHER I tell him the same thing. Suddenly, the WINDOWS are SHATTERED by GUNFIRE. \nBEN (to Vitti) The hell you are. You're supposed to be in my custody. We have therapy today. VITTI For what? The more we talk the worse I get. I had that dream again. BEN The one where you're Mussolini? VITTI No, the other one. BEN The limp sword dream? JELLY (at car) I probably shouldn't be listening to this. VITTI So don't! JELLY Sorry. \nBEN (to Vitti) Do you think this dream might be sexual? \nVITTI I know what you're thinkin'. The sword is my cock and I can't get it up, but that ain't it. I saw Sheila last night and I had a hard-on you could swing from. \nBEN (winces) I don't want to know that. VITTI You coulda hung wet towels on it. JELLY (calls out) He's like a racehorse in that area. BEN Okay!   I get it. VITTI (to  Jelly) Wait in the  car! (to  Ben) So what does  it mean? Ben sits on the wicker divan. BEN Sex can represent a lot of things. In your case I think it's about performance anxiety. Trying to find a job that fits. VITTI Doc -- nothing's gonna fit. That nine-to-five bullshit -- I'll fuckin' kill myself if I have to do that for the rest of my life. You know they take taxes out of your check? What the fuck is that? I'm doomed. I'm gonna end up selling hot dogs on the street. (starts breathing hard and sweating) Look at me. I'm havin' a fuckin' panic attack here. My heart's beatin' like a rabbit. BEN You're hyperventilating. \nHe empties the drugstore bag and hands it to Vitti. BEN Breathe into this. Vitti sits on a wicker chair. VITTI (speaks through bag) This is your fault. \nBEN Excuse me? VITTI Tellin' me I have to get a job like I'm some fuckin' nobody. It was humiliating! Thanks a lot. BEN (jumps up, in a total rage) Hey, I'm doing the best I can!     If you can't appreciate that, or if my    best isn't good enough for you, then    maybe you should find somebody else to    talk to, you selfish prick! Ben breaks down and cries what amounts to one racking sob, then quickly pulls himself together. BEN Sorry. VITTI What the hell was that? BEN I'm fine.    I'm grieving.   It's a process. Ben takes a pill bottle out of his pocket and pops a couple of pills. VITTI Now what are you takin'? BEN Echinacea and goldenseal. Do you know the TV show 'Little Caesar'? VITTI Yeah, I know it. BEN The producer of that show is a man \nnamed Raoul Berman. A mutual friend told him I knew you and Mr. Berman called me this morning. He wants to meet you. \nVITTI For what? BEN Meet him and find out. CUT TO: \nEXT. NOGO RESTAURANT - NIGHT Ben and Laura walk up to a trendy Japanese restaurant in Chelsea. Ben is really keyed up. LAURA We finally got him out of the house -- why are we having dinner with him? I mean, how professional is that? BEN This is not social. Paul's meeting a television producer who might have a job for him. He's nervous and wants me here as a buffer. I'm a buffer, that's all. LAURA He's a grown man. I don't see why he needs a chaperone. BEN He doesn't. He needs a buffer.    I'm here in buffer capacity only. LAURA Ben, if you say 'buffer' one more time Ben pops a couple of pills. LAURA Didn't you just take two of those? BEN No, that was something else. LAURA Well, you better not drink anything. You know what happens. BEN Laura? I'm a doctor?     I think I know what I'm doing. \nRAOUL (to Tony Bella) How incredible is this? Paul tells me they watch the show in Sing Sing! TONY BELLA Fantastic!    That's so fuckin' great. VITTI I wouldn't wet my pants over it.      They watch 'Supermarket Sweep,' too. Raoul laughs hard. \nVITTI You laugh too much. TONY BELLA So, Paul, you going to join us? Vitti looks around, his future plans now beginning to form. VITTI Yeah.    You got a good setup here. TONY BELLA Great.   See you later then. He exits.   Vitti turns to Raoul. VITTI Coupla things, though. I don't know who makes these decisions, but some of this, it don't look right. RAOUL (concerned) I sensed it myself. Which elements strike you as wrong? VITTI The people mainly. I mean, you got a boss who speaks Australian. What the fuck is that? And I'm guessing your \nbackground is -- what? RAOUL The theater, mostly. \nVITTI Yeah, the theater. So how about if I bring in some guys that I know -- you know, more 'authentic.' RAOUL I would be eternally grateful. Anything else? VITTI (thinks) Yeah. One of those trailers like the stars have. RAOUL (slight hesitation) Done. (shakes his hand) I'll put that in the works right now. He hurries off to talk to his assistant.   Jelly comes up to Vitti. \nJELLY You really gonna do this? VITTI No fuckin' way. I've had it with this job bullshit. A week of this and I'd either shoot myself or shoot Raoul. But it's good cover while I figure out my next move. Call the guys. JELLY You got it. CUT TO: MONTAGE Jelly and Vitti's old crew, MO-MO, BIGS, TUNA, EDDIE COKES, and eight or nine other wiseguys walk en masse into base camp. Vitti's guys go to the front of the lunch line, forcing the crew aside. A big, pop-out trailer labeled \"Mr. Vitti,\" guarded by three of his guys. Tuna brings a lunch tray and knocks on the door. Jelly opens the door and takes the tray. Vitti conferring with Raoul and Tony Bella on the script, \nripping out whole sections. Vitti in the makeup trailer getting a haircut and manicure while he smokes a cigar and talks on his cell phone. \nVitti with the costumer, approving and nixing various wardrobe choices, while Jelly steals an expensive watch in the b.g. Vitti in a massage chair getting a backrub from a masseuse. A PRODUCTION ASSISTANT approaches him. \nP.A. (PRODUCTION ASSISTANT) They're ready to start shooting, Mr. Vitti. VITTI Yeah, ten minutes, tell 'em. Eddie Devol, Patty LoPresti's guy, watches Vitti from a safe distance. CUT TO: EXT. SHOPPING MALL - DAY Ben comes out of the market carrying several grocery bags and a small prescription bag. Two Mafia SOLDIERS step up beside him and urge him toward a big stretch LIMO IDLING at the curb. SOLDIER Walk this way. BEN There must be some mistake.    I didn't order a limo. SOLDIER Get in the car. CUT TO: INT. KNIGHTS OF PALERMO - LATER Ben enters timorously, still carrying his groceries. Patty LoPresti, Masiello and a couple of other heavyweights are sitting at the table, all except Patti smoking cigars. Ben immediately recognizes their status and grasps the gravity of their mood. BEN (nervous, but trying to keep it light) Hello.   I'm Ben Sobel. And you are -- \nThe Soldier sits Ben down. The other soldier takes his groceries. Ben looks at Patty, trying to gauge her role. \nPATTY Jelly -- you're working here, too? JELLY I'm an extra. PATTY An extra what? JELLY A supernumerary. An 'atmosphere.' It ain't bad. You just stand around all day waitin' for them to shoot and they pay you eighty bucks. PATTY Eighty bucks? For standin' around all day? You used to sneeze eighty bucks. How much you make shootin' craps? JELLY Today?   About eight hundred maybe. PATTY And how about bookin' bets for the Teamsters and the crew? \nJELLY Another grand. One of the producers really likes the ponies. PATTY So eighteen hundred bucks. JELLY Plus eighty -- PATTY I know -- extra. They all laugh. An ASSISTANT DIRECTOR approaches the group. ASSISTANT DIRECTOR This is a closed set. We're about to start shooting. EDDIE Yeah?    So am I. Eddie grabs the Assistant Director and walks him away. CUT TO: EXT. \"LITTLE CAESAR\" BASE CAMP - SAME TIME \nThe trucks and trailers are arranged on a parking lot.   A car pulls up and Lou Rigazzi gets out with his bodyguards. DRIVER Should I wait here, Mr. Rigazzi? RIGAZZI No, pull the car up your ass and wait there. CUT TO: \nEXT. SET - SAME TIME Patty takes Vitti's arm and walks with him. PATTY I heard you had some more trouble. VITTI One of Rigazzi's guys took a shot at me. She stops at the extras' makeup table and starts primping in the mirror. PATTY I don't have to tell you, Paul. Alone on the street you don't stand a chance. That's what the family's all about. Since the old days, when the grandfathers first came over. That's not something you just walk away from. VITTI Yeah, I know. When you're a Jet, you're a Jet all the way. PATTY So you want to tell me what's going on here? It looks like you got your whole crew back together. VITTI Nothing's going on.   They're actors. PATTY Don't bullshit me, Paul. You're planning something. I'm feeling very left out. VITTI (quietly) Okay. Something big is going down, but you're getting a cut. My hand to God. \nPATTY You're a good friend, Paul. And I would never think of insisting on this, but I'd feel better if you brought in Eddie and some of my guys to help with the job. VITTI I don't think so. PATTY Then I'll have to insist. \nVITTI Whatever. Raoul approaches and eyes Patty disdainfully. RAOUL Oh, dear God. First of all, sweetheart, we're not shooting the hooker scene until tomorrow. And the hair -- please, what is that? PATTY Excuse me? \nVITTI Raoul, this is a friend of mine. Patty LoPresti. Raoul freezes, recognizing the name. RAOUL Mrs. LoPresti -- I am so very, very Raoul wheels on a production assistant who happens to be passing by. RAOUL How dare you not inform me Mrs. LoPresti was on the set. You're fired! (to Patty) Enjoy your visit with us. If there's anything I can do -- PATTY Go fuck yourself. RAOUL Immediately. Raoul moves away quickly.   Patty turns back to Vitti. PATTY It's good to have you back, Paul. \n(kisses Vitti on the cheek) We'll be in touch. \nShe exits. CUT TO: EXT. PARKING LOT - MOMENTS LATER As Patty and her men walk away down one aisle of trucks and campers, Rigazzi and his men walk down the next aisle heading for the set. They narrowly miss seeing each other. CUT TO: EXT. BASE CAMP - MOMENTS LATER Ben arrives looking for Vitti. He       sees Patty approaching and freezes, then quickly ducks behind      a nearby truck, shielding his crotch. Patty and her men pass       by. Ben waits until they pass, then comes out of hiding and      hurries on. CUT TO: \nBEN No, what are   you doing here? I came to tell you   we have a preliminary meeting with   your parole officer and who do I run   into? Patty LoPresti. VITTI Patty who? BEN What is this -- a knock-knock joke? Patty-who-kidnapped-me-and-threatened- to-cut-off-my-balls. Stop lying to me, Paul. Your whole gang is here. \nVITTI Who says I'm lying? I finally    get a straight job and start putting   my life in order and you come in here   and start accusing me! That's how    much you trust me? BEN (off   balance) It's not that   I don't trust you, I just don't --   trust you.   Are you lying to me?    Because I know you, Paul. You'll    say or do anything to get your own   way. VITTI This is what's so hard about being an ex-con. You make one little mistake in your life and people never let you forget it. BEN Oh, so now you're the victim?    I want the truth. VITTI Wait a second.    Say that again. \nBEN Say what? VITTI 'I want the truth.'   Say it -- like you did just now. BEN I want the truth? VITTI No, strong, like before. \nBEN (forceful) I want the truth! VITTI Yeah, that's good! BEN Paul -- VITTI No, I'm serious. That had power. I believed it. You could be an actor. \nBEN I'm not an actor -- VITTI Hey, you're as good as most of the bums I see around here. They have this part. You could do it. BEN Actually, I did The Music Man in tenth grade. VITTI Of course.   I'm gonna talk to Raoul. BEN About being on the show?   I couldn't - VITTI No, this part you could do.   It's perfect. Believe me. CUT TO: EXT. APARTMENT BUILDING - DAY (LATER) The camera rolls. \nASSISTANT DIRECTOR We're rolling. SOUNDMAN Sound speed. RAOUL (shouts) Action! \nON ROOFTOP \nJelly and Tony Bella drag Ben kicking and screaming to the edge of the roof and hang him over the edge. On the ground, Raoul and Vitti look up, watching the action. RAOUL (doubtful) Does that screaming sound real to you? VITTI Oh, yeah.    That sounds real. CUT TO: \nINT. BEN'S CAR - LATER Ben drives, pissed off.       Vitti chuckles to himself. BEN It's not funny! There was no safety harness or anything. They could have dropped me. VITTI Hey, if you didn't want to do it, why didn't you say something? BEN I know exactly what that was about. You resent the fact that you've been put in my custody, so you passive- aggressively arranged things to make me look like a fool. VITTI Come on -- you were great. BEN (turning on a dime) Really? I was scared at first, but on the second take, I think I found some good stuff. I was able to texture the screaming -- \nINT. BEN'S CAR - CONTINUOUS ACTION BEN (frantic) We can't do this, Paul!     We have to stop! This is a lease! \nGUNFIRE SHATTERS the rear WINDOW of the car. BEN (shouting back at the Mercedes) It's a goddamn lease! VITTI (looks back) Move over. I'll drive. BEN Move over?   Where? Vitti puts his left foot on the gas pedal and his left hand on the wheel. VITTI Backseat.    Now! Ben tries to launch himself into the backseat but is stopped by his seat belt. BEN Seat belt. He releases the belt, then twists and crawls over the top of the driver's seat into the back, while Vitti slides into the driver's seat. CUT TO: EXT. PARKWAY - MOMENTS LATER Ben's car races past an industrial area with the Mercedes right on its tail. CUT TO: \nEXT.

Mr. Bella asked if you could meet him in the makeup trailer. \nVITTI No, I gotta go. P.A. He said it was important. VITTI (annoyed) I'll talk to him tomorrow. He hands the P.A. some money. VITTI Here -- tell him you couldn't find me. Vitti exits.   The P.A. looks at the money. CUT TO: EXT. MAKEUP TRAILER - LATER Vitti makes his way past the trailers, heading for his car. As he passes the makeup trailer, the door opens and Tony Bella sticks his head out. TONY BELLA Paul!   Excellent! VITTI Can't really talk right now, mate. Headin' out. TONY BELLA Two seconds. Please, Paul.    It's really important. Vitti looks pissed. CUT TO: INT. MAKEUP TRAILER - MOMENTS LATER Vitti watches impatiently while the makeup artist touches up Tony Bella. TONY BELLA (script in hand) I'm looking for something to do when my character finds out he's being indicted. I was thinking of punching the wall, but I did that when they killed Uncle Lenny, and I did it again \nwhen Franny left me. Oh, and I punched a car, a van actually, when Peezee screwed up the big drug deal. So I'd like to find something different, that doesn't involve, you know, punching anything. VITTI Try kickin' something.   Let me know how it works out. Vitti starts for the door. \nTONY BELLA Wait, Paul.   That's interesting.    Like what? VITTI (impatient) I don't know. You could kick a guy in the face. TONY BELLA Who? VITTI (irritated) Just some guy! You knock him down, give him a couple quick kicks in the head while he's on the ground. TONY BELLA Why? VITTI Why not? Because he's there and you're pissed off. TONY BELLA You've done that? VITTI Maybe once or twice.   Look, I got people waiting. TONY BELLA (thinks about it, decides not) My character wouldn't do that.   What else? VITTI (at a loss, getting angrier) I don't know. You could yell real loud? \nTONY BELLA Yell real loud? That's original. VITTI (pops) Or keep your fuckin' mouth shut! Who gives a shit what you do, for cryin' out loud? Tony Bella likes something about Vitti's inflection. TONY BELLA (imitates him) Who gives a shit what you do, for cryin' out loud? VITTI What are you doin'? TONY BELLA What are you doin'? VITTI (irritated) Okay, you can cut that shit out right now. \nTONY BELLA Okay, you can cut that shit out right now. VITTI (menacing) Hey, I'm serious, asshole! TONY BELLA Hey, I'm serious, asshole! CUT TO: EXT. MAKEUP TRAILER - MOMENT LATER The door flies open and Tony Bella comes flying out of the trailer backwards, hitting the pavement hard. Vitti charges out of the trailer and storms away. Tony wipes blood from under his nose. TONY BELLA That was good.     My character could do that. CUT TO: EXT. SOBEL HOUSE - LATER A cab pulls up to the house, and Ben gets out. \nHe walks up the driveway and sees Jelly's car parked at the back door and a big man in a dark suit and tie wiping the windshield. \nBEN (irritated) Jelly!   Where's Paul? The guy in the suit turns.   It's Michael. BEN Michael?   What are you doing? \nMICHAEL Working. BEN (pleasantly surprised) You got a job? That's great. Look how handsome you look in that suit. What's the job? MICHAEL (reluctantly) I'm working for Mr. Vitti.   I'm his driver. \n(grimly, into radio) Call it off. We lost them. CUT TO: \nINT. MANHATTAN WAREHOUSE - MIDDLE OF NIGHT Vitti's guys are dressed like construction workers as they load their gear into two trucks. Vitti supervises while others work on a New York City bus. Eddie DeVol, Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby stand guard over the whole scene, in case anyone is thinking of defecting. Ben is wearing heavy dungarees and an oversized plaid shirt, struggling to lace his work boots. Jelly approaches him and tosses a bulletproof vest on the table. JELLY Here. See if this'll fit under your shirt. BEN (extremely nervous) I could fit you under my shirt.    Don't they have anything smaller? \nJELLY This ain't Bloomingdale's. Nobody knew you were comin'. You're lucky you're alive, Doc. He glances at Eddie DeVol. BEN (hisses) Nobody's going to be alive when this is over. What kind of plan is this? It's crazy. It's stupid! JELLY Watch it. It may be crazy but it ain't stupid. If you want to stay alive, just keep your mouth shut, do everything I tell you and try not to pee in your pants. (quietly) Can you handle an M-16? He holds up an automatic rifle. BEN You mean shoot it? JELLY No, I mean twirl it like a fuckin' baton. How about an A.K.? \nHe holds up another rifle. BEN (exasperated) Jelly -- JELLY (rummaging through pile) Kalashnikov, MAC-10, Uzi -- stop me if I hit one you like. \nBen sees Eddie watching him and gingerly picks up a 9mm handgun. BEN Couldn't I just take this? JELLY Yeah, that's a good one. That gun brings back a lot of fond memories. Use it in good health. Ben puts the gun into the waistband of his dungarees, but it slips through and drops into his pants. \nBEN (winces) Ooh, cold -- cold. He jams his hand down the front of his pants and starts searching around in there. Eddie and Enormous Bobby stare at him as they walk by. BEN (explaining) My gun -- fell down in my -- He shakes his leg and the gun drops out of his cuff and clatters onto the floor. He smiles weakly and picks it up. Vitti approaches.    He looks agitated but under tight control. VITTI (to Jelly) Check the bus. Jelly exits. VITTI (quietly, to   Ben) If we can, I'm gonna   get you out before the real shit   goes down. Just don't flip out on me,   okay? \nBEN You are making a huge mistake.   You know that, don't you? \nVITTI You said it yourself.   It's my nature. BEN It's not your nature!   You have a choice. VITTI What are you, fucking Jiminy Cricket? I don't know what planet you live on, but here on Earth it's 'might makes right.'   Read the papers. The guys with the guns make the rules. BEN (holding up the pistol) So I guess that makes me a real man now.  What happened to the white hat, Paul?  Your father wasn't wrong. You could be one of the good guys. VITTI Enough. Say one more word about my father and I'll break your fuckin' head. BEN (quietly) Okay. Vitti walks off. CUT TO: INT. BATHROOM - SAME TIME Vitti comes in, locks the door and has a full-blown panic attack -- gasping for breath, sweating, whimpering, trying to stifle his panic. Then he sees his tortured face in the mirror and starts pulling himself together. CUT TO: INT. WAREHOUSE - FEW MINUTES LATER The guys are getting into the trucks. Ben keeps letting everybody go in front of him, then starts to back away, but Eddie and Enormous Bobby come up behind him and push him up into the truck. \nEXT. MANHATTAN WAREHOUSE - NIGHT \nThe marshals handcuff them. Suddenly, the marshals hear AUTOMATIC WEAPONS FIRE coming from the next block. Uniformed SWAT COPS come running from that direction and shout to the marshals. SWAT LEADER They're escaping out the back!    Get over there! Move it! The marshals rush toward the sound of the GUNFIRE and disappear around the corner. CUT TO: NEXT BLOCK As the marshals round the corner, they see a police shoot-out in progress. Wiseguys are FIRING AUTOMATIC WEAPONS at cops who are pinned down behind police cruisers. The Captain of the marshals FIRES a warning SHOT in the air. CAPTAIN (on a bullhorn) Freeze! Drop your weapons! \nThe head wiseguy, Anthony Bella, turns in surprise. TONY BELLA What the hell is this? RAOUL (O.S.) (on his own bullhorn) Cut, cut, cut! What the hell's going on? Raoul strides out into the street, furious, still talking through his bullhorn. RAOUL (to the Captain) Who are you? What are you doing in my shot? The Captain and the marshals look around and see that they're on the set of \"Little Caesar.\" CAPTAIN What are you doing on my street? The Captain walks toward Raoul until they are almost face to face, shouting at each other through their BULLHORNS. \nRAOUL I have a permit! CAPTAIN I don't give a shit about your permit! The ASSISTANT DIRECTOR addresses the TV crew. ASSISTANT DIRECTOR All right, people. Back to one and let's try it again! (into his walkie-talkie) Release the traffic and reset for another take. On the perimeters of the set, the PA's signal the off-duty cops who work the set to release the real traffic they've been holding on the cross streets. A city bus passes behind Raoul and Tony Bella who are still screaming at the Federal Marshal. CUT TO: EXT. 11TH AVENUE - MINUTES LATER In mid-block, SWAT cops step into the street and wave the bus to a halt. \nCUT TO: INT.

They laugh and slap hands with Vitti and Ben. CUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION The bus pulls out and joins the flow of traffic heading downtown. CUT TO: INT. BUS - MINUTES LATER All the guys are looking pretty happy with their score. Ben turns to Vitti. BEN Feeling pretty good, huh? VITTI I felt worse. BEN So what now? You go on the run for the rest of your life? Back to Sing Sing? Or you turn up dead in an alley? VITTI Those are my choices? What   happened to lying on a beach in Costa  Rica for the next twenty years?   You can't let me enjoy this for  five fuckin' minutes? \nBEN Five minutes?    And then what? \nVITTI And then what?    I'll show you. CUT TO: EXT. RIGAZZI PLUMBING AND HEATING - NEXT MORNING A Rigazzi company van is forced open by a team of FBI agents led by Agent Miller. Stacked inside are forty gold bars.

How'd it go? VITTI Not so good. PATTY Yeah, I heard. It's all over the television. I never should've trusted Eddie. But, you know, a woman alone in the world is very vulnerable. VITTI Yeah, I know. PATTY At least I don't have to worry about the Rigazzis no more. Thanks to you. VITTI I told you -- I just want to be left \n", "test1_input": "BEN'S TABLE Nobody's hurt.   Vitti helps Sheila to her feet. BEN (to Vitti) What the hell was that? VITTI I think somebody's got it in for Raoul. \nRaoul crawls up from behind the table. RAOUL (wide-eyed) Holy fucking shit. (grinning) That was phenomenal! CUT TO: EXT. MIDTOWN STREET - LATER THAT NIGHT \nJelly stands in front of an apartment building parking garage. A guy comes walking up the ramp toward him. As he comes nearer, we see that the guy is the Gunman from the restaurant. JELLY Hey, pal -- got a light? The guy stops, pulls out a Zippo and lights it for Jelly. GUNMAN Where's your cigarette? JELLY I'm trying to cut down. The Gunman recognizes Jelly and desperately reaches for the gun in his pocket, but Jelly hauls off and whacks the guy across the back of the head with a sap. As  he slumps into Jelly's arms, Vitti steps out of a doorway and Jelly drags the gunman into the garage. CUT TO: INT. SOBEL HOUSE - SAME TIME Ben and Laura are getting ready for bed. LAURA I don't know why you feel you have to save this man. BEN It's my job.   He needs me. LAURA So that automatically means you have to help him? You're always doing this -- putting other people's needs ahead of your own, like you're this martyr or saint or something. It's like living with Mother Teresa. \nBEN Actually, I hear she was tough to live with. Lot of parties, loud music -- lepers. LAURA You don't need this in your life -- especially not now. You really need to be grieving for your father. \nBEN I am. LAURA Really?   I haven't seen it. BEN Well, you know, it's a process. I mean, we had issues -- there's some anger -- but I'll work it out. Laura goes to Ben and embraces him. LAURA It's okay, honey. You can let it go. \nBen almost starts to break, but he holds it back. BEN No, I'm -- it's okay. Ben sits heavily on the bed. BEN It's just a confusing time. I became a therapist because he was a therapist, so obviously his approval was very important to me. But is that the only reason I did it? I don't know. And now that he's gone, why do I keep doing it? Is this what I really want? She sits next to him and takes his hand. LAURA I just want you to be happy. She kisses him. BEN Maybe you're right. (kisses her) Maybe it's time I started focusing on me, and, you know, satisfying some of \nmy desires. He looks at her expectantly. \nLAURA (apologetic) Oh, honey, I just brushed my teeth. BEN No, that's not what I meant.     I just need -- (at a loss) I don't know what. She puts her arms around him and holds him. CUT TO: EXT. ROOFTOP - LATER THAT NIGHT Vitti and Jelly stand with the Gunman on the roof of the parking garage, four stories above the ground. The guy's arms are bound. Jelly ties a rope around his ankles. VITTI I'm gonna ask you once nicely.     Who you working for? \nGUNMAN Fuck you. VITTI Fuck me?    Fine. Jelly? Jelly shoves the guy to the parapet at the edge of the roof, grabs him by the legs and hangs him over the side of the building. The guy screams. VITTI I'll ask you again.     Who you working for? The guy keeps screaming. JELLY He's screamin' too loud.     Hold on a second. Jelly swings the guy against the building, hitting his head and dazing him momentarily. JELLY Go ahead. VITTI Who are you working for? \n", "test1_true": "Jelly drops the guy. The Gunman plunges three stories and lands heavily in a dumpster full of garbage. VITTI What's the matter with you?

RIGAZZI What the hell happened to you? \nGUNMAN Vitti threw me off a roof. RIGAZZI Vitti? You talked to Vitti?     What did you say to him? GUNMAN Nothing. I didn't tell him anything. Mr. Rigazzi, can I go -- I think my leg's broken. \nRIGAZZI That must hurt. Rigazzi pulls out a GUN with a silencer and SHOOTS the Gunman. RIGAZZI I hate to see people in pain. (to soldiers) Get him out of here. SOLDIER What about Vitti? RIGAZZI (musing) He's a hard man to kill. But he's not immortal. Our time will come. CUT TO: EXT. BACK-YARD SWIMMING POOL - DAY A big, family barbecue is going on in a back yard in Queens. Several children are splashing in an over-sized, above-ground swimming pool. Oddly, the children appear to be shouting and laughing but make no sound. At the barbecue, Nicky Caesar is watching his friend MELLO turn Italian sausage on the grill. CAESAR I like mine burnt. MELLO I don't know how you like your sausage? Twenty fuckin' years we been doin' this. So you got the money? The wind shifts and blows the smoke from the barbecue in their faces. \nCAESAR (coughing, eyes watering) Not all of it. I'm still light about fifteen large. (blinded by smoke) Can we cut? This is ridiculous. RAOUL (O.S.) (shouts) Cut! Can you do something about the fucking smoke? \nWe PULL BACK to reveal the set of \"Little Caesar.\" Assistant directors and production assistants echo the director: \"We're cut!\" \"Reset!\" \"Effects!\" Vitti observes the action sitting in a director's chair, still brooding over the previous night's events. Raoul sits next to him. RAOUL (to Vitti) This is the problem with shooting on location. But it's worth it for the authenticity. \nVITTI Yeah, this is real authentic. RAOUL (calls out) Tony! Come here a second. (to Vitti) Anthony Bella. He plays Nicky Caesar. VITTI I know who he is. They used to watch the show up at Sing Sing. RAOUL (delighted) Are you shitting me? ANTHONY BELLA joins them. RAOUL Tony, this is Paul Vitti. TONY BELLA (Australian accent) You don't have to tell me who he is. (shakes Paul's hand) It's a pleasure, mate. \nVITTI (reacting to accent) Mate? I don't believe this! You're an English guy? You ain't even Italian. TONY BELLA Australian-Italian. We got some paisans down under. VITTI Down under what? \n", "test1_id": 1917, "test2_input": "CUT TO: INT. CLUB ENTRANCE - MOMENT LATER \nBen enters the nightclub and starts moving through the crowd, looking for Vitti. He pushes through and sees Jelly and a few of the guys watching an exotic dancer, a beautiful young blonde in a skimpy costume, standing on a platform grinding in mock ecstasy. \nBEN Jelly! JELLY (yelling over music) Hey, Doc. What are you doin' here? BEN Where's Paul? Jelly tucks a few bills into her G-string.     She looks at Ben and winks suggestively. JELLY I think she likes you, Doc.     Give her a couple of bucks. Ben reluctantly digs in his pocket and holds out a bill to the stripper. BEN Can you break a twenty? The stripper sensuously fingers the top of her G-string, and Ben gingerly sticks the twenty in it. BEN Do I just make my own change? He tentatively reaches for some smaller bills in her G-string but she dances away. BEN (calls to her) A ten and five ones -- when you have the chance. He turns around to talk to Jelly, but he's already gone. Ben finds Jelly at a table with Vitti. BEN Okay, Paul, what's going on? \nVITTI (keyed up) What are you doing here? \nBEN I could ask you the same thing. VITTI What's it look like? We're just blowin' off a little steam. What's the big deal? \nEddie DeVol enters, flanked by his main guys, AL PACINO and ENORMOUS BOBBY. EDDIE How's it goin', Paulie? You know my guys -- Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino? VITTI (looks at him) Al Pacino? That's your real name? AL PACINO No. People call me that because I look like Al Pacino. (beat) The actor. VITTI Anybody ever call you Carol Burnett? AL PACINO No.   Why? VITTI 'Cause you look about as much like Carol Burnett as you look like Al Pacino. Ben laughs.   Al Pacino glares at him. BEN I do see a little Pacino there -- around the eyes. EDDIE So we're all here. Let's do it. He heads for the back of the club with his guys.   Vitti and Jelly start to follow. BEN (stops Vitti) Let's do what? \nVITTI You better get out of here. BEN (lays a hand on his arm) I'm not going until you tell me what's going on here. Vitti violently shakes off Ben's hand. VITTI (menacing) Don't make me hurt you.    Get the fuck out of here. He walks away leaving Ben frozen. Ben watches as they disappear through a door leading to the back of the club. He starts toward the door. CUT TO: INT. BASEMENT ROOM - MOMENTS LATER Vitti is seated at a big table in the crowded, smoke-filled room. Jelly sits at  his side. He's surrounded by his crew, about a half-a-dozen guys, and Patty's man, Eddie DeVol. Several street maps and diagrams are spread out on the table. VITTI Okay, this is big and we only get one shot at it; and there's only about a million ways this fuckin' thing can go bad, so listen up. Vitti pulls a street map to the center of the table and taps a spot downtown. VITTI The Federal Gold Depository in Lower Manhattan. Three times a year a shipment of gold bars goes in a heavily-guarded armored truck from the Depository to the vault at the Federal Reserve to hold for foreign governments that trade in bullion. At three o'clock in the morning -- eight hours from now --we're gonna hijack that truck. CUT TO: INT. LITTLE DARLING'S - SAME TIME Ben enters the back room of the club, looks around, and starts down the stairwell leading to the basement. \nCUT TO: INT. BASEMENT STAIRWAY - MOMENTS LATER \nBen makes his way down the cramped, dimly-lit stairway and approaches the door to the basement room. He raises his hand to knock, then hesitates and stands there for a moment listening to the MUFFLED VOICES inside. Suddenly he is grabbed from behind and slammed up against the door by Enormous Bobby. Bobby slams him against the door a couple of more times, using Ben's head as a doorknocker. The door is opened by someone inside and Enormous Bobby shoves Ben into the room. CUT TO: INT. BASEMENT ROOM - CONTINUOUS ACTION Ben hits the floor to a chorus of surprised reactions from the guys. Enormous Bobby pulls Ben off the floor by his lapels. EDDIE What the fuck is this? \n", "test2_true": "He starts muscling Ben to the door. VITTI What are you doing? \nEDDIE What do you think? He can make every guy in this room. BEN Oh, I'm not into that, fellas. \nVITTI Get your fuckin' hands off him!   He's with me. EDDIE What, on the job? Vitti hesitates. EDDIE (impatiently) Either he's in, or he's dead.    Which is it? BEN I think in is better. VITTI (reluctantly) He's in. He's my responsibility. EDDIE (to Vitti) Okay, no more surprises. And from this moment on, no one leaves my sight. Got it? Now go through it one more time. VITTI Okay -- everybody listen up. BEN Wait! (sits) Okay.    Go ahead. CUT TO: EXT. LITTLE DARLING'S - LATER THAT NIGHT Agents Cerrone and Miller watch the front of the club from their car parked across the street. \nCERRONE (yawns, checks watch) I wonder what it costs to keep that many limos waiting for three-and-a- half hours. \nTHEIR POV A dozen men looking like Vitti and his crew come out of the club and get into the limos. \nMILLER (O.S.) Everybody stand by. They're leaving. The limos drive off. At the corner, the FBI car pulls out and follows at a discreet distance. CUT TO: EXT. QUEENSBOROUGH BRIDGE - NIGHT The FBI car follows the limos across the bridge into Manhattan. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - LATER The limos pull up at the WWF Restaurant.     The FBI car stops up the block. CERRONE (V.O.) (over radio) 312, all units. W.W.F. Restaurant. Times Square. The limo doors open and the passengers get out -- all nondescript nobodies. CUT TO: INT. FBI CAR - SAME TIME Miller watches intently. MILLER Where's Vitti?   I don't see Vitti. Cerrone stares with the growing awareness that they've been had. CERRONE Damn it! \n", "test2_id": 1918, "test3_input": "CUT TO: EXT. STREET - SAME TIME The marshals run around, frantically searching for a way into the construction site. CUT TO: \nVITTI Totally in charge, he strides up to the armored truck just as his men finish cutting through the steel plate doors. Vitti yanks the doors open.. Vitti and Ben stare in awe at the exposed contents of the truck -- a fortune in gold bars. VITTI (shouts) Get the ramp! Eddie and his guys run up with a long, narrow track with metal rollers and set it up at the rear of the gold truck. EDDIE (very excited) You know, this might just fuckin' work. \nBEN You're gonna get in so much trouble. CUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - SAME TIME The marshals are trying to climb over the construction site wall, but they're stopped by rolls of razor wire and SUPPRESSING FIRE from inside the site. LIEUTENANT They can't get over the wire. CAPTAIN Then knock down the gates! CUT TO: EXT. CONSTRUCTION SITE The guys take the heavy bars out of the armored truck and run them quickly along the rolling track into the bus. CUT TO: \nINT. BUS - SAME TIME Jelly is pulling on the hat and jacket of a transit authority bus driver. The floor boards of the bus have been lifted out and the guys are laying the gold bars in the hollow under the floor. VITTI (pops his head in) Forty bars. That's all we need. \nBEN How much is that? VITTI $350 an ounce, 16 ounces in a pound, 90 pounds in each bar -- do the math. JELLY (a beat) Actually, gold is measured in troy ounces. 14.6 ounces to the pound. That would be... $18,396,000. BEN Really? JELLY Give or take. He hears a LOUD CRASH and all eyes turn to the gates. \nBEN Well, so much for not peeing in my pants. \nEddie goes off to help transfer the gold. CUT TO: EXT. STREET - SAME TIME The marshals back up one of the SUVs and run it into the gates again. \nCUT TO: INT. CONSTRUCTION SITE The big, wooden GATES SHUDDER but Vitti's men roll two enormous earthmovers up to reinforce the gates. BEN You know what you said about not flipping out? VITTI Yeah? \n", "test3_true": "BEN I can't breathe! I'm suffocating! VITTI (shaking him) For Chrissake, get hold of yourself! BEN I can't!   I'm dying!   We're all going to die! Suddenly, he slaps Vitti hard across the face.      They both freeze. BEN Did I just hit you? VITTI Yeah.   Feel better now? BEN (breaking down) I'm sorry, Paul. I blame myself for this. I wanted to help you. I wanted to be there for you. But I just wasn't good enough. \nVITTI You were good.  It isn't your fault. BEN No, it is. Since my father died -- (starts crying) I've lost my way. I don't know anything anymore. I mean, what's the point? I didn't think it would hit me so hard -- VITTI Would you just shut up about your father! BEN I'm grieving, goddammit!    Have a little respect! VITTI He was an asshole -- you said it yourself. What are you grieving for? BEN I'm grieving for myself, you fucking idiot! Ben lets it all go, sobbing for all the years of pain. \nVITTI (surprised, shrugs) Jeez, I'm sorry. \nBEN Now I know how you must have felt when your father was killed. Vitti looks at him. BEN (crying more) I mean, it had to be ten times worse for you -- being murdered right in front of you. And you were so young - VITTI We don't have time for this. BEN (really sobbing) It must've been so painful! VITTI (eyes filling with tears) I'm warning you -- don't do this -- BEN I mean, it's like all his hopes for you died with him. And that's so sad. VITTI (starting to cry) There I go. You happy now?      You see what you're doing here? Both men are crying now. BEN Your father really loved you. VITTI I loved him, too. I did. BEN (hugs him) I know. I know. Jelly comes around the corner and sees the two men in a weepy embrace. JELLY Oh, boy.    This is bad. \nAnother huge CRASH as the marshals ram the gates again, this time tearing loose one of the big hinges. JELLY Maybe we oughta should go. Vitti, Ben and Jelly run to the bus, but Eddie pulls a gun and stops them. Al and Bobby cover Jelly and the rest of the crew. Vitti backs away slowly. EDDIE Did you really think you were gonna live through this? VITTI I had my hopes. EDDIE Yeah, well, nice work.   Mr. Rigazzi will be very grateful. BEN (to Vitti) Rigazzi? I thought he worked for Patti LoPresti. VITTI That's what Patty thought, too. This scumbag's been playin' both sides against the middle. EDDIE There's only one side as far as I'm concerned. Mine. What did you think? I was just gonna stand by and let some fuckin' has-been move back in? So long, Mr. Vitti. He cocks the gun and is about to pull the trigger when Ben suddenly roars and slams him in the head with his gun. Vitti and Jelly quickly cover Al Pacino and Enormous Bobby. BEN (beating the shit out of Eddie) I can't take it anymore! That's what I hate about you fucking sociopaths! You just keep changing the rules to suit yourselves. Well, not this time, you anti-social asshole. You fucked with the wrong shrink! Sitting on Eddie's chest, he presses the gun against Eddie's nose. BEN Don't you read the papers?   The guy \nwith the gun makes the rules. VITTI Yeah, what? \nThey shove Eddie, Enormous Bobby and Al Pacino into the back of the armored truck, Vitti gives a signal and the crane lifts it off the ground. CUT TO: EXT. STREET - CONTINUOUS ACTION \nThe armored truck comes down fast and drops heavily to the street. Federal MARSHALS swarm the truck and find Eddie, Al, and Bobby sprawled in the back. CAPTAIN (screaming) On the floor! Face-down!   Now! AL PACINO (to Eddie) Nice goin'. Good plan. ENORMOUS BOBBY What's a sociopath? \n", "test3_id": 1919}

He's wearing a shiny, silk, short- sleeved shirt with the sleeves turned up, tight, black chino pants and short, black, pointy-toed boots. His hair is oiled and coifed like early Frankie Avalon. VITTI (distraught) I can't deal with this shit. My grades suck, I'm gettin' in fights every day, and if I get suspended again my mother's gonna fuckin' kill me -- if the nuns don't kill me first. \nBEN is listening to Vitti, but dressed as Sigmund Freud.

Confused but desperate, he holds up the sword to menace the intruders, but the sword suddenly goes limp. He tries to make the blade stand up, but it just keeps dropping like a piece of soft rope. Patty, Eddie, and the thugs laugh contemptuously at Vitti, while Jelly looks on with an incredible stream of tears pouring from his eyes. END DREAM SEQUENCE. CUT TO: \nINT. GUEST ROOM - NEXT DAY Vitti is back in bed in his robe, still asleep. The door opens and Laura enters with an interior decorator who has fabric samples over her arm. LAURA Now in here, I thought we'd get rid of the wallpaper and maybe put in some wainscoting -- She sees Vitti and quickly steers the decorator back outside. \nLAURA (to decorator) Don't look, don't look. \nShe comes back in, closes the bedroom door and confronts Vitti who is still groggy from his troubling dream. LAURA Do you realize it's almost noon? VITTI Really? Do me a favor, honey -- make me a sandwich. LAURA You want a sandwich? Make it yourself. I'm not afraid of you, Mr. Oh-I'm-A-Great-Big-Mobster Man. I want you out of my house. LAURA (CONT'D) I've had   it with the bathrobe and the skulking   around and the girlfriend who, I'm   sorry, is so obviously faking it's not   even funny. Enough! \nVITTI Coulda had that sandwich made by now. LAURA (tries new tack) Okay. You don't like me and I don't like you. We can at least agree on that, right? VITTI Okay. LAURA I'm going to be honest with you -- I'm a very anxious person -- VITTI Hey!    Me, too. LAURA We have so much in common. Anyway, this is not helping me, it's not helping my marriage, and I know Ben really needs some alone time. So I'm asking you -- as a human being -- could you please leave? (off Vitti's look) Yes, I'll make you a sandwich. \nVITTI Ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato, mayonnaise, no onion. \nCUT TO: EXT.

TONY BELLA So, Paul, you going to join us? Vitti looks around, his future plans now beginning to form. VITTI Yeah.    You got a good setup here. TONY BELLA Great.   See you later then. He exits.   Vitti turns to Raoul. VITTI Coupla things, though. I don't know who makes these decisions, but some of this, it don't look right. RAOUL (concerned) I sensed it myself. Which elements strike you as wrong? VITTI The people mainly. I mean, you got a boss who speaks Australian. What the fuck is that? And I'm guessing your \nbackground is -- what? RAOUL The theater, mostly. \nVITTI Yeah, the theater. So how about if I bring in some guys that I know -- you know, more 'authentic.' RAOUL I would be eternally grateful. Anything else? VITTI (thinks) Yeah. One of those trailers like the stars have. RAOUL (slight hesitation) Done. (shakes his hand) I'll put that in the works right now. He hurries off to talk to his assistant.   Jelly comes up to Vitti. \nJELLY You really gonna do this? VITTI No fuckin' way. I've had it with this job bullshit. A week of this and I'd either shoot myself or shoot Raoul. But it's good cover while I figure out my next move. Call the guys. JELLY You got it. CUT TO: MONTAGE Jelly and Vitti's old crew, MO-MO, BIGS, TUNA, EDDIE COKES, and eight or nine other wiseguys walk en masse into base camp.

Ben looks at her, sensing her command of the group. BEN We haven't really been introduced -- MASIELLO This is Mrs. LoPresti. \nPATTY Patty. BEN Ben Sobel. Ben offers his hand but she ignores it. PATTY Ben, Paul Vitti is important to this family. We don't want to see you turn him into a stromboni. BEN A stromboni? That thing they clean the ice with at hockey games? MASIELLO That's a Zamboni, asshole.   Stromboni. PATTY It's a bull with his balls cut off. She reaches under the table and grabs Ben's balls.    He winces in pain. BEN (squeezed) No, we don't want to do that. \nPATTY Not unless you want to be one, too. \nBEN (in pain) Me? No. I'm very attached to my balls. As you can probably tell.

It seems to hang in the air for a long time, then lands with a big splash and starts to sink almost immediately. \nBEN AND VITTI They jump out of the car and watch the Mercedes disappear under the water. BEN (aghast) You think they'll get out? VITTI Yeah, that's James Bond and the 'Sea Hunt' guy in there, so they got a pretty good shot. They hear POLICE SIRENS APPROACHING. Vitti starts walking away quickly. Ben follows after him. BEN Where're you going? VITTI I gotta take care of something. BEN But your parole officer -- VITTI Send my regrets. BEN I'm warning you.

CHAPIN Where is he, Dr. Sobel? BEN I wish I knew. CHAPIN Well, considering that he's in your custody, that's not quite the answer I was looking for. He's got something big in the works. You want to tell me what you know? BEN I don't know anything. As far as I can tell, he's making a real effort to go straight. CHAPIN Yeah, that's why I've got two corpses at the bottom of the river. He reaches through the open car window into his briefcase and pulls out a file of photographs. CHAPIN Here. Vitti with Sal Masiello. Vitti with Patty LoPresti. Vitti with Lou Rigazzi. Let me know -- I can order some wallet size for you. I've got more than enough to put him away again without these. Violation of parole, second-degree murder here. When I really start digging, it'll be amazing \nwhat I come up with. You have twenty- four hours to find him and deliver him to me. Otherwise you're looking at obstruction of justice, and accessory to felony manslaughter. And trust me, Dr. Sobel, if you don't like me now, you really don't want to see me in court. BEN I'm getting that.   Can I go now? \nHe starts for his car. CHAPIN You can't take your car. We're impounding it as evidence. BEN (exasperated) Then can somebody give me a ride home?

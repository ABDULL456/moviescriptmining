EXT. SPACE - X 
As the Universal logo completes itself, we begin to slowly push in on the East Coast of the United States. The camera glides down through the atmosphere, through the clouds, closer and closer, until we begin to see large patches of snow covering the upper coastline. It's winter. We continue to push in, until we arrive at one small suburban neighborhood. Over the push-in, we hear the following narration, delivered by Patrick Stewart. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) It has been said that magic vanished from our world a long time ago. And that humanity can no longer fulfill its desires through the power of wishes. To those who have lost the wondrous vision of childhood eyes, submitted here is the story of a little boy, and a magical Christmas wish that changed his life forever. 
EXT./ESTAB. A SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOOD - MORNING 
NARRATOR (V.O.) It began in 1985, in a town just outside Boston. 
We see a GROUP OF KIDS laughing and tossing snowballs at each other in the street. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) It was Christmas Eve, and all the children were in high spirits. That special time of year when Boston children gather together and beat up the Jewish kids. 
Another little kid walks out of his house with a sled, and starts walking up the street. One of the snowball- throwing kids points at the sled kid. 
KID #1 Hey, Greenbaum! 
GREENBAUM Uh oh. 
KID #1 It's Jesus' birthday tomorrow! You know what I'm gonna get him? 
GREENBAUM W...what? (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
KID #1 My fist in your fuckin' face! 
GREENBAUM Why would Jesus want that? 
KID #2 Get him! 
The kids all chase Greenbaum up the street, and tackle him. Another boy, JOHN BENNETT (about 8 years old, shy and innocent-looking) approaches the melee. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) But there was one child who wasn't in such good spirits. Little John Bennett. That one boy in every neighborhood who just has a tough time making friends. 
JOHN Hey guys, can I play? 
The kids all look at him. 
KID #1/#2/#3 Get outta here! / Get outta here, Bennett! / Get lost, Bennett! 
The Jewish kid, his face bloodied, looks angrily at John. 
GREENBAUM Yeah, Bennett, get outta here! 
The kids go back to beating up Greenbaum, as John sadly walks back toward his house. 
INT. JOHN'S BEDROOM - SHORTLY AFTER 
NARRATOR (V.O.) John longed with all his heart for that one true friend that he could call his own. And he knew that if he ever found that friend, he would never let him go. 
John sadly sits by his window with his chin in his hands, looking outside. John'S POV - We see the other kids all playing in the snow: building snowmen, throwing snowballs, etc. At one point, a BLACK KID IN A WHEELCHAIR wheels up. The other kids welcome him with open arms, and he immediately joins in the fun. 
NARRATOR (V.O.) Well, as it does every year, Christmas morning finally came. (MORE) (CONTINUED) CONTINUED: NARRATOR (V.O.) (CONT'D) All the children were opening their gifts with holiday glee. 
INT. A SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING 
A LITTLE GIRL opens a present as her parents look on, smiling. Inside is a My Little Pony. She smiles with delight. 
INT. ANOTHER SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING 
A LITTLE BOY opens a present as HIS PARENTS look on, smiling. Inside is a G.I. Joe Hovercraft. The boy is overjoyed. 
INT. A THIRD SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING 
ANOTHER LITTLE BOY opens a present as his parents look on, smiling. Inside is a "Darth Vader head" action figure case. The boy opens it up, revealing that it's full of "Star Wars" action figures. The boy jumps around ecstatically. 
EXT./ESTAB. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - MORNING 
INT. A FOURTH SUBURBAN HOUSE - SAME 
NARRATOR (V.O.) And for little John Bennett, Christmas Day brought a very special new arrival. 
John sits amidst unwrapped gifts. We see him opening a present. Inside is a plush, adorable-looking teddy bear. The boy holds it with delight. 
JOHN Wow! 
HIS MOM AND DAD hug him. 
JOHN'S DAD I guess Santa paid attention to how good you were this year, huh? 
JOHN'S MOM (KISSING HIM) Merry Christmas, John.

The Holidome sign reads, Welcome ASMI `09 Participants!!! Tim gets out of the rental car. He looks around-- not too shabby. But upon spotting a SIKH CABBIE in a turban, Tim straightens up and cautiously adjusts his money cummerbund. 
As he walks toward the entrance, a pretty but gaunt young woman in a short denim skirt, BREE, 22, approaches him. 
BREE Hey man, can I bum a heater? 
TIM What's that now? 
BREE A cigarette? 
TIM Oh, I'm like, "this gal wants to borrow my heater?" Tss. But no, sorry, can't help you there. 
BREE You here for the convention? 
TIM You bet. Tim Lippe. Northlands Insurance. How `bout yourself? 
BREE Ah, Bree. I'm Bree. 
They shake hands. 
TIM Well Bree, it's nice to meet you. But let me give you a trade secret. (STAGE WHISPER) Keep smoking and your premiums will go through the roof. 
BREE Thanks Mr. Surgeon General. (they laugh, then) (MORE) Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
BREE (CONT'D) If you want to party, Tim, let me know. I'll be around. 
TIM You bet. Party hearty. Nice chatting with you, Bree. 
People are so friendly. Tim enters the hotel. 
INT. HOLIDAY INN HOLIDOME - DAY 
Tim walks in. He strolls atop the velvety green carpet, past a fountain, beneath a golden-colored chandelier and makes his way to the front desk-- blown away. An apple-cheeked clerk, whose name tag reads TRENT, greets him. 
TRENT Checking in with us, sir? 
TIM You tell me. Never done the hotel deal before. 
TRENT Well, welcome. I'll just need to see a credit card for the incidentals... 
TIM (reads the name tag) Trent, I was given the impression that you honored traveler's checks. 
TRENT Yes, we just need an imprint of your card. For the incidentals. 
TIM Traveler's check is a fully insured method of, y'know. 100 percent. 
TRENT I'm aware of that, sir. We won't charge the card unless you rent a movie or take something from the mini-bar... 
TIM I'm a non-drinker. 
TRENT It's standard, sir. Cedar Rapids, 6-12-09 
Tim eyes Trent cautiously as he unzips his cummerbund/money belt. He removes a credit card and reluctantly hands it over. 
INT. HOLIDAY INN HOLIDOME, HALLWAY - MOMENTS LATER 
Cell phone to his ear, Tim struggles with his bag as he walks to his room. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Have you seen the pool yet? 
TIM Not yet, but I can smell it. The chlorine. It's a super top-notch place, Mil. You'd be blown away. Oop, 321. I'm at mi casa. Just a... lemme see how this deal works. 
He examines the card key. He slides it in. It doesn't work. Tries again. Doesn't work. Each time he fails, it beeps. 
TIM (CONT'D) Key's like a stinkin' credit card. 
Suddenly, the door opens. And standing before Tim is a BLACK MAN. Tim gasps, drops his suitcase, backs away. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) What? What happened? 
TIM (to the man) Oh jeez. I'm sorry. I'm... Please. (turns, whispers into phone) There's an Afro-American gentleman in this room. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) Well get the heck outta there! 
Tim turns back and smiles, frightened. The man looks confused. 
MILLIE (O.S. ON PHONE) (CONT'D) Tim! Run like hell, Tim!

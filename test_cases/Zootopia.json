{"train": "ZOOTOPIA \nWritten by \nJared Bush & Phil Johnston \nStory by Byron Howard, Rich Moore, Jared Bush, Jim Reardon, Josie Trinidad, Phil Johnston and Jennifer Lee \nIN BLACK -- \nWe hear the feral, primeval sounds of a jungle at night. A timpani bangs an ominous beat. \nFADE IN ON: \nA JUNGLE - NIGHT \nA BUNNY nervously walks through the dark, foreboding forest, frightened by every shadow and moving leaf. \nYOUNG JUDY (V.O.) Fear. Treachery. Bloodlust! Thousands of years ago, these were the forces that ruled our world. A world where prey were scared of predators. And predators had an uncontrollable biological urge to maim and maul and... \nThe timpani crescendos. A JAGUAR leaps out of the shadows, attacks the bunny, who screams-- \nCUT TO: \nINSIDE A BARN - A JUNGLE (SET) - NIGHT \nThe action continues-- as imagined by an amateur stage production. \nYOUNG JUDY Blood, blood, blood! \nReams of red papier m\u00e2ch\u00e9 entrails ooze from the bunny. And when those run out-- projectile ketchup. \nReveal: These are ANIMAL KID ACTORS. The bunny, JUDY HOPPS, 10, is our hero. And this is her play being staged. A banner reads: CARROT DAYS TALENT SHOW! \nYOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) And death. \nThe CROWD looks on, confused. The music goes discordant as BOBBY CATMULL, a bobcat, bangs a drum. \nYOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) Back then, the world was divided in two. Vicious predator or Meek prey. \nTWO BOXES drop down, labeled VICIOUS PREDATOR and MEEK PREY. The PREDATOR box lands on the jaguar. The MEEK PREY box lands on Judy. Her entrails get stuck outside the box. She drags them underneath with her. \nYOUNG JUDY (O.S.) (CONT'D) But over time, we evolved, and moved beyond our primitive savage ways. \nA YOUNG SHEEP wearing a white muumuu and a cardboard rainbow on his head does an improvisational dance across the stage. Judy and the jaguar burst out of their boxes, now wearing white muumuus, too. \nYOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) Now, predator and prey live in harmony. \nJudy and the jaguar shake hands as the sheep throws glitter. \nYOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) And every young mammal has multitudinous opportunities. \nASTRONAUT SHEEP Yeah, I don't have to cower in a herd anymore. \nThe Jaguar rips off his muumuu. She's wearing a homemade astronaut costume. \nASTRONAUT SHEEP (CONT'D) Instead I can be an astronaut. \nCatmull plays a slide whistle. \nACTUARY JAGUAR I don't have to be a lonely hunter any more. \nThe Jaguar rips off his muumuu. He's dressed in a suit. \nACTUARY Today I can hunt for tax exemptions. I'm gonna be an actuary! \nYOUNG JUDY And I can make the world a better place! I am going to be... \nCatmull plays a 70s-style cop show theme on the boom box. Judy rips off her muumuu, revealing a POLICE OFFICER UNIFORM. \nYOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) A police officer! \nJudy's parents, BONNIE & STU, look stunned. A mean fox kid, GIDEON GREY, snickers. He's sitting next to a WEASEL KID. \nGIDEON GREY Bunny cop. That is the most stupidest thing I ever heard. \nYOUNG JUDY It may seem impossible to small minds-- (points at Gideon) I'm looking at you Gideon Grey. \nGIDEON GREY Nice costume, loser. What crazy world are you living in where you think a bunny could be a cop? \nYOUNG JUDY Kindly return my friends' tickets. \nGideon pats the tickets in his pocket. \nGIDEON GREY Come and get `em.... But watch out, `cause I'm a fox-- and like you said in your dumb little stage play, us predators used to eat prey. And that killer instinct's still in our Dunnahh. \nTRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID (sotto, to Gideon) Uh, I'm pretty much sure it's pronounced D-N-A. \nGIDEON GREY Don't tell me what I know, Travis. \nYOUNG JUDY You don't scare me, Gideon. \nGideon shoves Judy. Hard. She falls. The other prey animals flee to safety behind a nearby tree, leaving her to face the thugs alone. \nGIDEON GREY You scared now? \nJudy starts to tear up. Her nose starts to twitch. \nTRAVIS THE WOLF HENCHMAN KID Lookit her nose twitch. She is scared! \nGIDEON GREY Cry little baby bunny. Cry, cry -- \nSuddenly-- BAM! Judy kicks Gideon in the face with her hind legs. He stumbles back, then checks his lip for blood. \nGIDEON GREY (CONT'D) Oh, you don't know when to quit, do ya? \nHe unsheathes his claws like a switchblade, then slaps her, drawing blood from her cheek. She cowers, as do her scared friends behind the tree. \nGIDEON GREY (CONT'D) I want you to remember this moment-- the next time you think you will ever be anything more than just a stupid, carrot farming dumb bunny. \nGideon and his pal head off, laughing and high-fiving. The prey animals run back over to Judy, who wipes the blood from her cheek. She fights tears, defeated. \nGARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY That looks bad. \nSHARLA Are you okay, Judy? \nYOUNG JUDY Yeah... Yeah, I'm okay. \nJudy smiles and then whips out the tickets as she gets up. \nYOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) Here you go. \nSHARLA Wow! You got our tickets! \nGARETH THE DOUBTING SHEEP BOY You're awesome, Judy! \nSHARLA Yeah! That Gideon Grey doesn't know what he's talkin' `bout. \nYOUNG JUDY Well, he was right about one thing... \nJudy picks up the cop hat, puts it on her head. \nYOUNG JUDY (CONT'D) I don't know when to quit. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. POLICE ACADEMY TRAINING FACILITY - DAY \nHopps and the comparatively huge CADETS sit in a circle as MAJOR FRIEDKIN, an intimidating drill instructor, lectures. \nMAJOR FRIEDKIN Listen up Cadets! Zootopia has 12 unique ecosystems within its city limits-- Tundra Town, Sahara Square, Rainforest District, to name a few. You're gonna have to master all of them before you hit the streets-- or guess what? (to Hopps) You'll be dead! \nIN SAHARA SQUARE SIMULATOR: \nHopps struggles through the sand. \nMAJOR FRIEDKIN(CONT'D) Scorching sandstorm. You're dead, bunny bumpkin! \nON THE VINE-COVERED MONKEY BARS: \nHopps swings across the bars, simulating the RAINFOREST DISTRICT. She falls off, landing face first in the mud. \nMAJOR FRIEDKIN (O.S.) (CONT'D) 1000 foot fall. You're dead, carrot face! \nTUNDRA TOWN ICE WALL: \nJudy can barely contain her glee. Her parents are in shock. \nBELLWETHER Congratulations, Officer Hopps. \nJUDY I won't let you down. This has been my dream since I was a kid. \nBELLWETHER Ya know, it's a... It's a real proud day for us little guys. \nLIONHEART Bellwether, make room will ya? Come on. \nLionheart shoves Bellwether out of the way. \nLIONHEART (CONT'D) Okay, Officer Hopps. Let's see those teeth! \nA group of PHOTOGRAPHERS aim their cameras. Lionheart steps in front of Bellwether, edging her out of the photo. The flashbulbs pop. \nEXT. BUNNYBURROW TRAIN STATION - DAY \nStu, Bonnie, and several SIBLINGS accompany Judy to the train station. \nBONNIE HOPPS We're real proud of you, Judy. \nSTU HOPPS Yeah. Scared, too. \nBONNIE HOPPS Yes. \nSTU HOPPS Really, it's kind of a proud-scared combo. I mean, Zootopia. It's so far a away... It's such a big city. \nJUDY Guys-- I've been working for this my whole life. \nBONNIE HOPPS We know. And we're just a little excited for you, but terrified. \nJUDY The only thing we have to fear is fear itself. \nSTU HOPPS And also bears. We have bears to fear, too. To say nothing of lions, and wolves... \nBONNIE HOPPS Wolves? \nSTU HOPPS ...weasels... \nBONNIE HOPPS You play cribbage with a weasel. \nSTU HOPPS And he cheats like there's no tomorrow. You know what, pretty much all predators-- and Zootopia's full of `em. \nBONNIE HOPPS (scolding) Oh, Stu. \nSTU HOPPS And foxes are the worst. \nBONNIE HOPPS (retreating) Actually, your father does have a point there. It's in their biology. Remember what happened with Gideon Grey. \nJUDY When I was 9. Gideon Grey was a jerk, who happened to be a fox. I know plenty of bunnies who are jerks. \nSTU HOPPS Sure. Yeah, we all do. Absolutely. But just in case, we made you a little care package to take with you. \nBONNIE HOPPS And I put some snacks in there. \nStu begins pulling a bunch of PINK FOX DETERRENTS from a bag. \nSTU HOPPS This is fox deterrent. \nBONNIE HOPPS Yeah that's safe to have there. \nSTU HOPPS This is fox repellent... \nBONNIE HOPPS Okay, the deterrent and the repellent. That's all she needs. \nSTU HOPPS Check this out! \nStu removes a Fox Taser, fires it up. It sizzles. \nBONNIE HOPPS Oh for goodness sake. She has no need for a fox taser, Stu. \nSTU HOPPS Oh c'mon. When is there not a need for a fox taser? \nJUDY Okay, look-- I will take this to make you stop talking. \nJudy grabs the pink fox repellent from the bag as the train pulls up. \nHOPPS (disgusted with herself) I'm such a... \nJERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. Oh come on, kid. Back up. Listen, buddy, what? There aren't any fox ice cream joints in your part of town? \nHopps suddenly stops. Her ears go up and she turns around. \nNICK Uh, no no, there are. There are. It's just, my boy-- (tousles boy's hair) --this goofy little stinker-- he loves all things elephant. Wants to be one when he grows up. \nThe boy gives a TOOT-TOOT with his toy elephant trunk. \nNICK (CONT'D) Isn't it adorable? Who the heck am I to crush his little dreams, huh? Right? \nJERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. Look, you probably can't read, fox but the sign says... (MORE) \nJERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. (CONT'D) (slowly reads SIGN, belittling) WE RESERVE THE RIGHT TO REFUSE SERVICE TO ANYONE. So beat it. \nELEPHANT You're holding up the line. \nThe little fox is about to cry, when Hopps walks up. \nHOPPS (O.S.) Hello? Excuse me? \nJERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. Hey, you're gonna have to wait your turn like everyone else, metermaid. \nHOPPS Actually... (revealing badge) I'm an officer. Just had a quick question. Are your customers aware they're getting snot and mucous with their cookies and cream? \nAn ELEPHANT COUPLE overhear and spit out their ice cream. \nJERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. What are you talkin' about? \nHOPPS Well, I don't wanna cause you any trouble, but I believe scooping ice cream with an un-gloved trunk is a Class 3 Health Code Violation... \nA guilty EMPLOYEE releases a scoop from their trunk. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) ...Which is kind of a big deal. Of course-- I could let you off with a warning if you were to glove those trunks and, I don't know, finish selling this nice dad and his son a... what was it? \nNICK A Jumbo Pop. Please. \nHOPPS A Jumbo Pop. \nJERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. (stews for a beat, then) Fifteen dollars. \nNICK Thank you so much. (to Hopps) Thank you. (then, digs for wallet) Oh no, are you kidding me? I don't have my wallet. I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck, that's the truth. Oh boy, I'm sorry pal. Gotta be about the worst birthday ever. Please don't be mad at me. (kisses him, to Hopps) Thanks, anyway. \nHe turns to go. Hopps slaps some money on the counter. \nHOPPS Keep the change. \nEXT. JUMBEAUX'S CAFE - MOMENTS LATER \nHopps has the Toddler's hand. Nick holds a HUGE JUMBO-POP. \nNICK Officer, I can't thank you enough. So kind, really, can I pay you back? \nHOPPS Oh no, my treat-- it just-- y'know, it burns me up to see folks with such backward attitudes toward foxes. I just wanna say, you're a great dad and just a... a real articulate fella. \nNICK Ah, well, that is high praise. It's rare that I find someone so non- patronizing... Officer... \nHOPPS (totally misses his dig) Hopps. Mr... \nNICK Wilde. Nick Wilde. \nHOPPS (to Toddler) And you little guy, you want to be an elephant when you grow up... you be an elephant-- because this is Zootopia, anyone can be anything. \nHopps puts a STICKER BADGE on the boy's chest. \nNICK Ah, boy, I tell him that all the time. All right here ya go-- (hands him popsicle) Two paws. Yeah. Oh, look at that smile, that's a happy birthday smile! All right, give her a little bye-bye toot toot. \nThe kid toots. \nHOPPS Toot, toot! \nNICK Bye now! \nHOPPS Goodbye! \nHopps walks off with a spring in her step. \nNICK Alright look, everyone comes to Zootopia thinking they can be anything they want. Well you can't. You can only be what you are. (points to himself) Sly fox. (MORE) \nNICK (CONT'D) (points to her) Dumb bunny. \nHOPPS I am NOT a dumb bunny. \nNICK Right. And that's not wet cement. \nShe looks down. She's landed in wet cement. \nNICK (CONT'D) (as he goes) You'll never be a real cop. You're a cute meter maid though. Maybe a supervisor one day. Hang in there... \nINT. HOPPS'S APARTMENT, HALLWAY - EVENING \nCLOSE ON HER WELCOME MAT: Hopps wipes off her cement covered feet. Then she enters \nTHE APARTMENT -- \nHopps turns on the radio. Everybody Hurts plays. She changes the station. A sadder song comes on. She changes the station repeatedly, each song progressively sadder. Finally, she lands on a treacly instrumental that will score the scene. \nShe puts in a microwave dinner: CARROTS FOR ONE. Hopps takes her food (A SINGLE CARROT) and sits at a small table. \nHer phone rings. INSERT: MOM & DAD FACETIME. Hopps shakes her head, sighs, then puts on a fake smile and answers. \nHOPPS Oh hey, it's my parents! \nBONNIE HOPPS Aw there she is! Hi sweetheart! \nTHE FACETIME cuts between Bonnie on her phone. Stu will pop in and out of frame. \nSTU HOPPS Hey there, Jude the Dude! How was your first day on the force? \nHOPPS It was real great. \nBONNIE HOPPS Yeah? Everything you ever hoped? \nHOPPS Mmm. Absolutely. And more. Everyone's so nice. And I feel like I'm really making a difference-- \nSTU HOPPS (pops head into frame) Hey, wait a second. Holy cripes, Bonnie! Look at that! \nBONNIE HOPPS (a discovery) Oh my sweet heaven-- Judy, are you a meter maid? \nHopps is still wearing her vest, and her hat is on the chair. \nHOPPS (panicked) Oh this? No! Oh, no no! This is just a temporary thing-- \nBONNIE HOPPS It's the safest job on the force! \nSTU HOPPS Ah, she's not a real cop! Our prayers have been answered! \nBONNIE HOPPS Glorious day! \nSTU HOPPS Meter maid, meter maid! \nHOPPS Dad! Dad-- \nSTU HOPPS Meter maid, meter maid! \nHOPPS DAD! You know what-- it's been a really long day, I should really-- \nBONNIE HOPPS That's right. You get some rest! \nSTU HOPPS Those meters aren't gonna maid themselves. \nBONNIE HOPPS Bye bye! \nHOPPS (eye roll) Buh-bye. \nShe hangs up, defeated. The SELF-PITYING MUSIC comes up full. \nORYX POOTOSSER (O.S.) Hey Bunny! Turn down that depressing music! \nKUDU POOTOSSER (O.S.) Leave the meter maid alone! Didn't you hear her conversation? She feels like a failure! \nJudy turns off the music. \nORYX POOTOSSER (O.S.) Oh, shut up! \nResuming the chase, Hopps jumps off the building-- landing precariously in the midst of a large group of mice. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Oh! Oh, sorry! Coming through! `Scuse me! `Scuse me. Pardon... \nHopps locates Weaselton, who's safely making his escape on the top of a tiny mouse train. \nDUKE WEASELTON Bon voyage, flat foot! \nBut Hopps won't quit. She takes a short cut and knocks him off the train. Rodents scream and run amidst the chaos. \nHOPPS Hey! Stop right there! \nThe Weasel throws an ornamental donut at Hopps. \nDUKE WEASELTON Have a donut, coppah! \nBut the donut misses and rolls towards some SHREWS coming out of \"Mousies.\" \nFRU FRU SHREW Ohmygawd, did you see those leopard print jeggings? (sees the donut about to kill her) Aaaaaaaaaaaagh! \nBut at the last second... Hopps stops it! Deep breath... \nHOPPS I love your hair. \nFRU FRU SHREW Aw... thank you. \nMeanwhile, the Weasel spots the bag he was stealing and smugly picks it up, ready to leave. \nDUKE WEASELTON Come to papa... \nThen out of nowhere, Hopps dumps the donut on his head. \nINT. ZPD - LOBBY - A LITTLE LATER \nThe lobby is overflowing with ANIMALS filing MISSING MAMMAL REPORTS. Clawhauser is dealing with an otter, MRS. OTTERTON. \nCLAWHAUSER Okay, you're gonna have to be patient and wait in line just like everyone else, Mrs. Otterton, okay? \nJust then: BAM! The Weasel (in donut) rolls through the front door and hits Clawhauser's desk. It settles, revealing Hopps. \nHOPPS I popped the weasel! \nBehind her, Chief Bogo yells from the second floor. \nBOGO HOPPS! \nINT. ZPD - BOGO'S OFFICE - A LITTLE LATER \nHopps sits in a big chair in front of Bogo, like a kid in the principal's office. Bogo looks over a report. \nBOGO Abandoning your post, inciting a scurry, reckless endangerment of rodents... but to be fair, you did stop a master criminal from stealing two dozen... moldy onions. \nHOPPS Hate to disagree with you, sir, but those aren't onions. Those are a crocus varietal called Midnicampum Holicithias. They're a Class C Botanical, sir. I grew up in a family where plant husbandry was kind of a thing. \nBOGO Shut your tiny mouth, now. \nHOPPS Sir, I got the bad guy. That's my job. \nBOGO Your job is putting tickets on parked cars. \nCLAWHAUSER (INTERCOM) Chief, uh, Mrs. Otterton's here to see you again. \nBOGO Not now. \nCLAWHAUSER(INTERCOM) Okay, I just didn't know if you wanted to take it this time, she seems really upset-- \nBOGO Not now! \nHOPPS Sir, I don't want to be a meter maid... I wanna be a real cop. \nBOGO Do you think the Mayor asked what I wanted when he assigned you to me? \nHOPPS But sir, if you-- \nBOGO Life isn't some cartoon musical where you sing a little song and your insipid dreams magically come true. So let it go! \nMRS. OTTERTON barges in, with Clawhauser trailing, wheezing. \nClawhauser places the Otterton file on his desk for Hopps. \nCLAWHAUSER Here ya go! One missing otter! \nHopps opens the file. It's a single piece of paper. What? \nHOPPS That's it?! \nCLAWHAUSER Yikes! That is the smallest case file I've ever seen! Leads: none, witnesses: none-- and you're not in the computer system yet, so resources: none. (chuckles) I hope you didn't stake your career on cracking this one. \nClawhauser takes a bite of his donut and the crumbs land on a picture in the file, drawing Hopps's attention to it. \nHOPPS Okay. (deep breath) \"Last known sighting...\" \nHopps brushes away the crumbs, revealing a picture of Mr. Otterton on the street. Clawhauser annoyingly slurps from a soda bottle. Hopps squints at the picture, intrigued. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Can I just borrow-- (grabbing soda bottle) Thank you. \nHopps uses Clawhauser's bottle to enlarge the picture. She sees Mr. Otterton holding a PAWPSICLE. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Pawpsicle. \nCLAWHAUSER The murder weapon! \nHOPPS Get your pawpsicle... \nCLAWHAUSER Yeah, `cause that... What does that mean? \nHOPPS It means I... have a lead. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. DOWNTOWN STREET - LATER \nWe find Nick pushing a BABY STROLLER. HOPPS zooms up in her traffic cart, smiling. \nHOPPS Hi! Hello? It's me again! \nNICK Hey, it's Officer Toot Toot. \nHOPPS (fake laugh, humoring him) Ha-ha-ho, no actually it's Officer Hopps, and I'm here to ask you some questions about a case. \nNICK What happened, meter maid? Did someone steal a traffic cone? It wasn't me. \nHopps looks ahead, Nick has gone around the corner. Hopps pulls in front of Nick and sounds her siren. \nNICK (CONT'D) Hey, Carrots, you're gonna wake the baby, I gotta get to work. \nHOPPS This is important, sir. I think your ten dollars worth of popsicles can wait. \nNICK I make 200 bucks a day, fluff. 365 days a year, since I was 12, and time is money, hop along. \nHOPPS Please, just look at the picture. \nHopps holds up the traffic cam picture of the Otter. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) You sold Mr. Otterton that popsicle right? Do you know him? \nNICK I know everybody. And I also know that somewhere there's a toy store missing its stuffed animal, so why don't you get back to your box. \nHopps' ears droop. \nHOPPS Fine. Then we'll have to do this the hard way. \nShe puts a boot on the stroller. \nNICK Did you just boot my stroller? \nHOPPS Nicholas Wilde, you are under arrest. \nNICK For what? Howting your feewings? \nHOPPS Felony tax evasion. \nNick smile drops a bit. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Yeah. 200 dollars a day... 365 days a year... since you were 12, that's two decades, so times twenty... (calculating) (MORE) \nYAX THE HIPPIE YAK (CONT'D) As you can see, Nangi's an elephant, so she'll totally remember everything. Hey Nangi, these dudes have some questions about Emmitt the Otter. \nNANGI Who? \nYAX Uh, Emmitt Otterton? Been coming to your yoga class for like 6 years? \nNANGI I have no memory of this beaver. \nJUDY He's an otter actually. \nYAX He was here a couple Wednesdays ago. `Member? \nNANGI Nope. \nYAX Yeah, he was wearing a green cable- knit sweater vest, and new pair of corduroy slacks. Oh, and a paisley tie. Sweet Windsor knot. Real tight. Remember that Nangi? \nNANGI No. \nNangi doesn't want to be bothered. And she's useless. Yax is a gold mine, though! Hopps writes down everything he says. \nYAX Yeah, and we both walked him out and he got into this big ol' white car with a silver trim? Needed a tune up. The third cylinder wasn't firing. `Member that, Nangi? \nNANGI Nope. \nHOPPS You didn't happen to catch the license plate number, did you? \nYAX Oh, for sure. It was 29THD03. \nHOPPS 0, 3... Wow, this is a lot of great info, thank you. \nYAX Told ya Nangi has a mind like a steel trap. I wish I had a memory like an elephant. \nEXT. SAHARA SQUARE - MOMENTS LATER \nNick and Hopps emerge. \nNICK Well, I had a ball. You are welcome for the clue. And seeing as how any moron can run a plate, I will take that pen and bid you adieu. \nAs Nick reaches to take it, Hopps realizes something and leaves him hanging. \nHOPPS The plate... I can't run a plate... (frustrated grunt) I'm not in the system yet. \nNICK Give me the pen please. \nHopps gets an idea... \nHOPPS (still withholding pen) What was it you said? \"Any moron can run a plate?\" Gosh... if only there were a moron around who were up to the task... \nNICK Rabbit, I did what you asked, you can't keep me on the hook forever. \nHOPPS Not forever. Why, I only have 36 hours left to solve this case. So can you run the plate or not? \nNICK Actually, I just remembered I have a pal at the DMV... \nEXT. DMV - LATER \nThey arrive at the DMV, the \"Department of Mammal Vehicles.\" \nNICK Flash is the fastest guy in there, you need something done, he's on it. \nHOPPS I hope so, we are really fighting the clock and every minute counts. (suddenly stops, alarmed) Wait. They're all sloths?! \nUnfortunately, every mammal working there is a... SLOTH. INSERT: SLOTH EMPLOYEES taking extraordinary amounts of time to do the simplest of tasks-- stapling, stamping, etc. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) You said this was going to be quick! \nNICK (faux innocence) What? Are you saying that because he's a sloth, he can't be fast? I thought in Zootopia anyone could be anything. \nNick smiles. Hopps doesn't. They head to Flash's station. \nNICK (CONT'D) Flash, Flash, hundred yard dash! Buddy, it's nice to see ya. \nFlash doesn't respond. Beat. \nFLASH Nice to... (beat) (beat) see you... (beat) (beat) too. \nHopps looks like she's going to die. \nFLASH Ha... ha... ha... ha... \nHOPPS Ha, ha, yes very funny, very funny, can we please just focus on the task-- \nFlash slowly reaches over to the sloth next to him. \nFLASH Hey... Priscilla... \nHOPPS Oh no! \nPRISCILLA Yes... Flash? \nFLASH What... do... \nHOPPS No! \nFLASH You call... a... \nHOPPS A three humped camel? Pregnant! Okay, great, we got it, please just- \nFLASH Three... humped... \nHOPPS Aggggggghhhhhhh-- \nINT. DMV - LATER \nA slow DOT-MATRIX printer spits out the address for CAR LICENSE PLATE NUMBER: 29THD03. \nFLASH Here... \nHOPPS Yeah, yeah, yeah... thank you! \nFLASH You... go. \nHOPPS (frantically reads) 29THD03-- it's registered to... Tundratown Limo Service? A limo took Otterton, and the limo's in Tundratown-- it's in Tundratown! \nNICK Way to hustle, bud. I love ya. I owe ya. \nHOPPS Hurry, we gotta beat the rush hour and-- \nEXT. DMV - CONTINUOUS \nThey go outside. It's night. \nHOPPS IT'S NIGHT?! \nEXT. SNOWY LOT - MOMENTS LATER \nNick and Hopps reach LEGITIMATE ENTERPRISE CAR SERVICE. Hopps tries to open the lock. \nHOPPS Closed. Great. \nNICK Mm. And I will betcha you don't have a warrant to get in. Hm? Darn it. It's a bummer. \nThere's a big gated parking lot which is chained shut... but they can see a few limos parking inside, covered in snow. \nHOPPS You wasted the day on purpose. \nNICK Madam, I have a fake badge. I would never impede your pretend investigation. \nHOPPS It's not a pretend investigation! Look, see-- (showing picture of Otterton) See him? This otter is missing. \nNICK Well then they should have gotten a real cop to find him. \nHOPPS What is your problem? Does seeing me fail somehow make you feel better about your own sad, miserable life? \nNick considers this for a moment. \nNICK It does. One hundred percent. (then) Now... since you're sans warrant, I guess we're done? \nHopps considers this and sighs, defeated. \nHOPPS Fine. We are done. Here's your pen. \nHopps then casually throws it over the fence behind her. \nNICK Hey! (staring at the pen) (MORE) \nPull out to reveal the car passing through the security gate of a residential compound. A POLAR BEAR GUARD lets them in. \nINT. MR. BIG'S RESIDENCE - MOMENTS LATER \nNick and Hopps are shoved into a room that's right out of The Godfather. A POLAR BEAR enters... \nHOPPS (sotto) Is that Mr. Big? \nNICK (sotto) No. \nNow an even BIGGER POLAR BEAR enters... \nHOPPS What about him? Is that him? \nNICK (sotto, frustrated) No. \n...and then another. The BIGGEST POLAR BEAR yet... \nHOPPS That's gotta be him. \nNICK Stop talking stop talking stop talking-- \nThe huge polar bear growls at Nick, then reveals a tiny chair upon which sits... a TEENY, TINY ARCTIC SHREW... this is MR. BIG. He sounds like Marlon Brando sped up to 78 rpm. \nNICK (CONT'D) Mr. Big, sir, this is a simple misunder- \nMr. Big holds out a TINY FINGER for NICK to KISS HIS RING. Nick painstakingly does so. \nNICK (CONT'D) This is a simple misunderstanding. \nMr. Big motions for Nick to shut up. \nMR. BIG You come here unannounced... on the day my daughter is to be married? \nNICK Well actually we were brought here against our will, so... (Mr. Big is not impressed) Point is, I did not know it was your car, and I certainly did not know about your daughter's wedding. \nMR. BIG I trusted you, Nicky... I welcomed you into my home... we broke bread together... Gram-mama made you her cannoli. And how did you repay my generosity? With a rug... made from the butt of a skunk. A skunk butt rug. You disrespected me. You disrespected my gram-mama who I buried in that skunk butt rug. I told you never to show your face here again, but here you are, snooping around with this... (re. Hopps) What are you, a performer? What's with the costume? \nHOPPS Sir, I am a c-- \nNICK Mime! She is a mime. This mime, cannot speak. You can't speak if you're a mime. \nHOPPS No. I am a cop. And I'm on the Emmitt Otterton case, and my evidence puts him in your car, so intimidate me all you want, I'm going to find out what you did to that otter if it's the last thing I do. \nMr. Big considers this and makes that little grunt. \nMR. BIG Then I have only one request: say hello to Gram-mama. Ice `em! \nThe Polar Bears snatch Nick and Hopps. \nNICK Whoa-- I didn't see nothing-- I'm not saying nothing-- \nMR. BIG And you never will-- \nThe polar bears open a hidden door on the floor, revealing an icy pool beneath. \nNICK Please! No no no! If you're mad at me about the rug I've got more rugs! \nNick and Hopps are about to be dumped in, when-- \nFRU FRU SHREW Oh, Daddy, it's time for our dance. (sees them trying to kill Nick) What did we say? No icing anyone at my wedding! \nMR. BIG I have to, baby. Daddy has to. (to Thugs) Ice `em. \nNick and Hopps scream and-- \nFRU FRU SHREW Wait. WAIT! She's the bunny that saved my life yesterday. From that giant donut. \nMR. BIG This bunny? \nFRU FRU SHREW Yeah. Hi! \nHOPPS Hi. (warm, whisper) I love your dress. \nFRU FRU SHREW Aw, thank you. \nMr. Big motions for the Polar Bears to put Hopps down. \nNick guides Hopps to a PASSING GONDOLA, motioning her in. \nNICK (CONT'D) Officer Hopps? \nThe gondola pulls away, leaving Bogo and the rest of the police watching, flabbergasted. \nINT./EXT. GONDOLA - CONTINUOUS \nHopps and Nick both stare straight ahead. \nHOPPS Thank you. \nNICK Never let `em see that they get to you. \nHopps looks at Nick, a little surprised. Nick looks out. \nHOPPS So, things do get to you... \nNICK No... I mean, not anymore. But I was small and emotionally unbalanced like you once. \nHOPPS Har-har. \nNICK (retreating into the memory) No, it's true. I think was 8, or maybe 9, and all I wanted to do was join the Junior Ranger Scouts. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. YOUNG NICK'S BEDROOM - DUSK (FLASHBACK) \nYOUNG NICK, tiny and cherubic, looks in the mirror. We see MOTHER's paws tying the scout kerchief around his neck. \nNICK (V.O.) ...so, my mom scraped together enough money to buy me a brand new uniform because, by God, I was gonna fit in. \nEXT. SCOUT BUILDING - NIGHT (FLASHBACK) \nYoung Nick bounds down the sidewalk and up the stairs. \nNICK (V.O.) Even if I was the only predator in the troop-- \nINT. SCOUT MEETING - MOMENTS LATER (FLASHBACK) \nYoung Nick enters a church basement, spots a GROUP OF PREY KIDS, all in scout uniforms. They wave him over. \nNICK (V.O.)(CONT'D) ...the only fox. \nMEAN KID ANIMAL (O.S.) Okay, Nick! \nNICK (V.O.) I was gonna be part of a pack. \nMEAN KID ANIMAL Ready for initiation? \nYOUNG NICK Yeah! Pretty much born ready. \nThey high five Nick. It looks promising and fun. \nNICK (V.O.) I was so proud. \nSuddenly, a BIG KID turns off the lights. Other KIDS switch on FLASHLIGHTS, shining them on Nick like gestapo spotlights. \nMEAN KID ANIMAL Okay. Now raise your right hand and deliver the oath. \nYOUNG NICK I, Nicholas Wilde, promise to be brave, loyal, helpful, and trustworthy. \nMEAN KID ANIMAL Even though you're a fox? \nYOUNG NICK What? \nThen, a bunch of KID ANIMALS tackle Nick. Soon, all of the animals pile on, kicking and shoving him. \nYOUNG NICK (CONT'D) No! What did I do wrong, you guys?! No! Please tell me, what did I do wrong?! \nWith Nick pinned, the primary mean kid straddles him. Someone hands him a MUZZLE. The mean kid snaps it on Nick's snout. \nYOUNG NICK (CONT'D) (muzzled) What did I do?! \nMEAN KID ANIMAL If you thought we would ever trust a fox without a muzzle, you're even dumber than you look. \nNick breaks free from the kids. Scrambles away from them in fright. As they laugh, he races out the door. \nJudy swats Nick, but accidentally hits Bellwether's puff. \nBELLWETHER Where to? \nHOPPS Rainforest District, Vine and Tujunga. \nANGLE ON the computer screen. \nBELLWETHER There! Traffic cams for the whole city. This is so exciting, actually. Well, you know, I never get to do anything this important. \nHOPPS But you're the Assistant Mayor of Zootopia. \nBELLWETHER Oh, I'm more of a glorified secretary. I think Mayor Lionheart just wanted the sheep vote... (then, cheerily) But he did give me that nice mug. \nShe motions to a mug that reads World's Greatest Dad Assistant Mayor. \nBELLWETHER (CONT'D) Feels good to be appreciated. \nLIONHEART (INTERCOM) Smellwether?! \nBellwether cringes. \nBELLWETHER That's a fun little name he likes to use. I called him Lionfart once. He did not care for that, let me tell you. It was not a good day for me. (pressing intercom button) Yes, sir? \nLIONHEART (INTERCOM) I thought you were going to cancel my afternoon?! \nBELLWETHER Oh, dear. I better go -- (to Hopps, while leaving) Let me know what you find. It was really nice for me to be-- \nLIONHEART (INTERCOM) While we're young, Smellwether! \nBellwether finally opens her big heavy door and leaves. \nNICK You think when she goes to sleep she counts herself? \nHOPPS Shush. Okay, traffic cams... (looking at computer) Tujunga, Tujunga... we're in. \nNick and Hopps watch the footage from the night before. We can see the jaguar going nuts. Then a BLACK VAN skids up, and some WOLVES hop out. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Who are these guys? \nNICK Timberwolves. Look at these dumdums. \nThe Wolves suddenly capture the jaguar with a net. Judy GASPS, shocked. Nick is unfazed. \nNICK (CONT'D) Betcha a nickel one of em's gonna howl. \nThe wolves howl... \nNICK (CONT'D) And there it is. What is it with wolves and the howling? It's like-- \nHOPPS (light-bulb moment) Howlers! Night howlers! That's what Manchas was afraid of... wolves! The wolves are the night howlers. If they took Manchas... \nNICK ...I bet they took Otterton too. \nHOPPS All we gotta do is find out where they went. \nShe clicks the monitor... but as the wolves drive off, they disappear through a tunnel and don't come out the other side. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Wait. Where'd they go? \nNICK You know, if I wanted to avoid surveillance because I was doing something illegal-- which I never have-- I would use the maintenance tunnel 6B... which would put them out... \nHe clicks on another camera. Nothing... then... the wolves emerge in the van. \nNICK (CONT'D) ...right there. \nHopps looks at Nick, impressed. \nHOPPS Well, look at you, Junior Detective. You know, I think you'd actually make a pretty good cop. \nNICK How dare you. \nHopps goes back to clicking... we track the wolves through alleys and back roads. \nNICK (CONT'D) Acacia alley... Ficus underpass... South Canyon... \nHOPPS They're heading out of town... Where does that road go? \nBADGER DOCTOR Mayor Lionheart, please, we're doing everything we can. \nHopps whips out her phone, starts recording. \nLIONHEART Really? Cuz I got a dozen and a half animals here who've gone off the rails crazy-- and you can't tell me why. Now, I'd call that awfully far from doing everything. \nBADGER DOCTOR Sir, it may be time to consider their biology. \nLIONHEART What? What do you mean biology? \nBADGER DOCTOR The only animals going savage are predators. We cannot keep it a secret. We need to come forward. \nLIONHEART Hmm... Great idea. Tell the public. And how do you think they're gonna feel about their mayor, who is a lion?! I'll be ruined! \nBADGER DOCTOR Well, what does Chief Bogo say? \nLIONHEART Chief Bogo doesn't know. And we are going to keep it that way. \nBeep-beep-beep-- Hopps' parents call in. She frantically tries to silence her phone. \nLIONHEART (CONT'D) Someone's here! \nBADGER DOCTOR Sir, you need to go, now! (calls out) Security! Sweep the area! \nAN ALARM SOUNDS. The door to the cell Hopps and Nick are in triggers shut. They notice WOLVES approaching. \nNICK Great! We're dead. We're dead. That's it. I'm dead. You're dead. Everybody's dead. \nThis gives Hopps an idea. She looks at the HUGE TOILET. \nHOPPS Can you swim? \nNICK What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why? \nThe Wolves storm in, searching for the intruders... and see the swirling water of a toilet disappearing down the drain. \nHopps and Nick fly through the water slide like tubes of the sewer system, cascading over a waterfall. Both scream. They land in the river below. Nick pop up first. He looks desperately for Judy. \nNICK (CONT'D) Carrots?! Hopps?! Judy?! \nShe emerges, gasping for breath, holding up the bagged phone. \nHOPPS We gotta tell Bogo! \nINT. BOGO'S OFFICE - DAY \nCLOSE ON BOGO'S PHONE: Gazelle and Bogo dance on stage. It's the same app Clawhauser used earlier. \nGAZELLE (ON PHONE) Wow, you are one hot dancer... (robo-voice) ...CHIEF BOGO. \nBogo is dancing along when, suddenly, Clawhauser bursts in. \nCLAWHAUSER Chief Bogo! \nBOGO (guilty) Not now! \nCLAWHAUSER Wait, is that Gazelle? \nBOGO (struggling to silence his phone) No! \nGAZELLE (ON PHONE) I am Gazelle, and you are one hot dancer. \nCLAWHAUSER You have the app too?! (ecstatic) Oh, jeeeeez! \nBOGO Clawhauser, can't you see I'm working on the missing mammal cases?! \nCLAWHAUSER Oh, yes of course! About that, sir... Officer Hopps just called... She found all of `em. \nBogo's eyes widen. \nGAZELLE (ON PHONE) Wow! I'm impressed. \nEXT. ASYLUM - DAY \nCop cars and helicopters surround the asylum. Hopps, flanked by Bogo and other COPS, leads Lionheart out of the building. \nHOPPS Mayor Lionheart, you have the right to remain silent. Anything-- \nHOPPS Yes. What I mean is, thousands of years ago... um... predators survived through their aggressive hunting instincts. For whatever reason, they seem to be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. \nNick doesn't like what he's hearing. \nREPORTER (O.S.) Of course they did. \nNick looks at the posters of the muzzled animals and shakes his head, disbelieving. FLASH BACK to his memory of being muzzled as a child. \nMEAN KID ANIMAL (V.O.) (during flashback) Aw, is he gonna cry. \nREPORTER (O.S.) (on Nick, as flashback ends) Officer Hopps, could it happen again? \nHOPPS It is possible. So we must be vigilant. And we at the ZPD are prepared and are here to protect you... \nThis sends the Press into an absolute frenzy. \nPRESS Will more mammals go savage? / What is being done to protect us? / Have you considered a mandatory quarantine on predators? \nBellwether steps in, eager to put an end to the questions. \nBELLWETHER Okay, thank you Officer Hopps, uh, that's all the time that we have. No more questions... \nBellwether ushers Hopps off stage. \nHOPPS Was I okay? \nBELLWETHER Oh, you did fine. \nHopps walks across the lobby to Nick, completely unaware that she just started a controversy. \nHOPPS (excited) That went so fast! I didn't get a chance to mention you or say anything about how we-- \nNICK (upset) Oh, I think you said plenty. \nHOPPS What do you mean? \nNICK (sarcastic, hard) Clearly, there's a biological component? These predators may be reverting back to their primitive, savage ways. Are you serious? \nHOPPS I just stated the facts of the case. I mean, it's not like a bunny could go savage... \nNICK Right. But a fox could? Huh? \nHOPPS Nick, stop it. You're not like them. \nNICK Oh, there's a them now? \nHOPPS You know what I mean. You're not that kind of predator. \nNICK The kind that needs to be muzzled? The kind that makes you think you need to carry around Fox Repellent? \nHopps sighs guiltily. \nNICK (CONT'D) Yeah, don't think I didn't notice that little item the first time we met. (escalating anger) So let me ask you a question. Are you afraid of me? (Hopps looks heartbroken) Do you think I might go nuts? Do you think I might go savage? Do you think I might try to... EAT YOU?! \nHe lunges, like he's going to bite her. She flinches and unthinkingly puts her hand on the repellent. \nNICK (CONT'D) (calm, hurt) ...I knew it. Just when I thought somebody actually believed in me... \nHe shoves the application at her. \nNICK (CONT'D) Probably best if you don't have a predator as a partner. \nAs he walks away, he takes off the sticker badge, crumples it and tosses it away. \nHOPPS No. Nick. Nick! \nREPORTER 5 Officer Hopps! Were you just threatened by that predator? \nHOPPS No. He's my friend. \nREPORTER 6 We can't even trust our own friends? \nHOPPS That is not what I said! Please! \nREPORTERS Are we safe? / Have any other foxes gone savage? \nBut no one will listen. Not anymore. \nHopps looks at the pamphlet. Bellwether sits across from her at her desk. \nHOPPS Um... I don't understand. \nBELLWETHER Our city is 90% prey, Judy. And right now they're just really scared. You're a hero to them. They trust you. And so that's why Chief Bogo and I want you to be the public face of the ZPD. \nBogo sits next to Hopps. She looks at the pamphlet again. \nHOPPS (struggling to find words) I'm not... I'm not a hero. I came here to make the world a better place, but I think I broke it. \nBOGO Don't give yourself so much credit, Hopps. The world has always been broken. That's why we need good cops-- like you. \nHOPPS With all due respect, sir, a good cop is supposed to serve and protect-- help the city. Not tear it apart. (deep sigh) I don't deserve this badge. \nShe removes her badge... \nBOGO Hopps. \nBELLWETHER Judy, you've worked so hard to get here. It's what you've wanted since you were a kid. You can't quit... \nHOPPS Thank you for the opportunity. \nHopps sets her badge on the desk and walks out. Bellwether and Bogo look at one another in shock and concern. \nFADE OUT. \nEXT. HOPPS' FARMS VEGETABLE STAND - DAY \nHopps, with a thousand yard stare, works the carrot stand. She wraps some carrots in a newspaper-- Headline: GROWING UNREST DIVIDES CITY-- and hands them to a RABBIT FAMILY. \nHOPPS A dozen carrots. \nRABBIT MOM Thanks! \nHOPPS Have a nice day. \nRABBIT MOM (to daughter) Come on. \nHopps reads the paper as Stu and Bonnie approach, concerned. \nSTU HOPPS Hey there, Jude-- Jude the dude, remember that one? How we doin? \nHOPPS. I'm fine. \nBONNIE HOPPS You are not fine. Your ears are droopy. \nHopps remains fixed on the newspaper and lets out a sigh. \nHOPPS Why did I think I could make a difference? \nSTU HOPPS Because you're a trier, that's why. \nBONNIE HOPPS You've always been a trier. \nHOPPS Oh, I tried. And it made life so much worse for so many innocent predators. \nOff-screen, BEEP-BEEP. \nSTU HOPPS Oh, not all of them, though. Speak of the devil. Right on time. \nA truck pulls up. Its sign reads: GIDEON GREY'S GOOD BAKED STUFF... With Fresh Produce From Hopps Family Farms. \nHOPPS Is that... Gideon Grey? \nSTU HOPPS Yep. It sure is. We work with him now. \nBONNIE HOPPS He's our partner. And we never would have considered it had you not opened our minds. \nSTU HOPPS That's right. I mean, Gid's turned into one of the top pastry chefs in the tri-burrows. \nHOPPS That's really cool, you guys. \nGIDEON GREY, now paunchy, climbs out his truck. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Gideon Grey. I'll be darned. \nADULT GIDEON GREY Hey Judy-- I'd like to say I'm sorry for the way I behaved in my youth. I had a lotta self-doubt that manifested itself in the form of unchecked rage and aggression. I was a major jerk. \nHopps cocks her head. Huh? Nick turns to her... holding her recording pen. \nNICK Don't worry, Carrots, I'll let you erase it... in 48 hours. \nHopps sniffles and wipes a tear from her eye. \nNICK (CONT'D) Alright, get in here. \nHopps leans her head on Nick's chest. He gives her a hug. \nNICK (CONT'D) Okay. Oh, you bunnies... You're so emotional. There we go. Deep breath. (then) Are you just trying to steal the pen. Is that what this is? (then) You are standing on my tail, though. Off, off, off. \nHOPPS I'm sorry. \nINT. HOPPS' FAMILY TRUCK - MOMENTS LATER \nHopps drives as Nick sits shotgun-- eating blueberries. \nNICK I thought you guys only grew carrots. (then, eats) What's the plan? \nHOPPS We are gonna follow the night howlers. \nNICK Okay. How? \nHOPPS (shows picture of weasel) Know this guy? \nNICK Uh-huh. I told you, I know everybody. \nEXT. ZOOTOPIA STREET - LATER \nWe find the weasel selling crappy knock-off merchandise on a street corner. \nDUKE WEASELTON Well, hello, step right up! Anything you need... I got it. All your favorite movies! I got movies that haven't even been released yet! \nAn ARMADILLO CUSTOMER scans an array of blatant knock-off movies like \"Wreck-it Rhino,\" \"Wrangled,\" and \"Pig Hero 6.\" \nDUKE WEASELTON (CONT'D) Hey, 15% off! 20! Make me an offer! Come on! \nNICK (suddenly appearing) Well, well, look who it is. The duke of bootleg. \nDUKE WEASELTON What's it to you, Wilde? Shouldn't you be melting down a popsicle or something? (sees Hopps) Hey, if it isn't Flopsy the Copsy. \nHOPPS We both know those weren't moldy onions I caught you stealing. What were you gonna do with those night howlers, Wessleton? \nDUKE WEASELTON It's Weaselton. Duke Weaselton. And I ain't talking, rabbit. And ain't nothing you can do to make me. \nWeaselton flicks a toothpick in her face. Hopps smiles at Nick. \nINT. MR. BIG'S PLACE - A LITTLE LATER \nWe find polar bears holding the weasel over the ice pit. \nMR. BIG Ice `em. \nDUKE WEASELTON Aaagh! Agh! (to Nick) Ya dirty rat! Why ya helping her?! She's a cop! \nMR. BIG And the godmother to my future granddaughter. \nReveal: FRU FRU is pregnant. \nFRU FRU SHREW I'm gonna name her Judy. \nHOPPS Aw. \nMR. BIG (to polar bears) Ice this weasel. \nDUKE WEASELTON All right, all right, please! I'll talk! I'll talk. I stole them night howlers so I could sell `em. They offered me what I couldn't refuse... Money. \nHOPPS And to whom did you sell them? \nDUKE WEASELTON (PRE-LAP) A ram named Doug. We got a drop spot underground... \nEXT. SUBWAY STATION - A LITTLE LATER \nNick and Hopps approach an abandoned subway station. \nDUKE WEASELTON (V.O.) ...Just watch it. Doug is the opposite of friendly. He's unfriendly... \nBELLWETHER (CONT'D) Think of it-- 90 percent of the population, united against a common enemy. We'll be unstoppable. \nThe Rams are about to pounce on Hopps and Nick... only to find the shadow is coming from a MUMMIFIED JACKALOPE being illuminated by a shop light. \nBELLWETHER (CONT'D) (to Goons) Over there! \nHopps and Nick are making a run for it. They're going to make it to the ZPD! When suddenly... \nBAM! A RAM tackles them both, knocking the case out of Nick's paws. Both of them fall into a sunken diorama. Bellwether, with case in hand, looks over the edge. \nBELLWETHER (CONT'D) Well, you should have stayed on the carrot farm, huh? It really is too bad; I really did like you. \nHOPPS What are you going to do? Kill me? \nBELLWETHER No! Of course not... he is. \nBellwether takes the dart gun out of the case, aims at Nick and... THWICK! She darts him. \nHOPPS No! Nick?! \nNick starts to shake and crouch. Bellwether dials her phone. \nBELLWETHER Yes, police! There's a savage fox in the natural history museum. Officer Hopps is down! Please hurry! \nNick is starting to turn. \nHOPPS No. Nick, don't do this. Fight it. \nBELLWETHER Oh, but he can't help it, can he? Since preds are just biologically predisposed to be savages. \nNick stalks Hopps, who tries to limp away. \nBELLWETHER (CONT'D) Gosh, think of the headline: \"Hero Cop Killed By Savage Fox...\" \nHOPPS So that's it, prey fears predator, and you stay in power? \nBELLWETHER Yeah, pretty much. \nHOPPS It won't work. \nBELLWETHER Fear always works. And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way. \nHOPPS (as Nick stalks her) Oh, Nick! No! \nBELLWETHER Bye-Bye, Bunny. \nNick lunges. He attacks. Hopps screams. Bellwether smiles. \nHOPPS Blood, blood, blood! And death. \nBellwether looks confused. Nick stands up. \nNICK All right, you're milking it. Besides, I think we got it, I think we got it. We got it up there, thank you yakkety-yak-- you laid it all out beautifully. \nBELLWETHER What? \nBellwether looks at her gun, in disbelief. \nNICK Yea, oh, are you looking for the serum? (holds it up) Well, it's right here. \nHOPPS What you've got in the weapon there- - those are blueberries. From my family's farm. \nLivid, Bellwether sees a blueberry in the gun's chamber. \nNICK They are delicious. (licking fingers) You should try some. \nBELLWETHER I framed Lionheart, I can frame you too! It's my word against yours! \nHOPPS Oooo, actually-- \nHopps holds up the carrot pen. \nBELLWETHER (ON CARROT PEN RECORDER) And I'll dart every predator in Zootopia to keep it that way... \nHOPPS --It's your word against yours. It's called a hustle, sweetheart. Boom. \nBogo and a TEAM OF COPS burst onto the scene. Bellwether looks to run but there's nowhere to go. She's nailed. \n", "test1_input": "HOPPS Greasy walls... rickety bed... \nKUDU POOTOSSER (O.S.) Shut up! \nORYX POOTOSSER (O.S.) You shut up! \nKUDU POOTOSSER (O.S.) No! You shut up! \nHOPPS Crazy neighbors... (big smile as she flops on the bed) I love it! \nAs the shouting continues, she stretches out on her bed, exhausted but overjoyed. \nWAKE UP MONTAGE - MORNING \nQuick, rhythmic cuts of: \n- Alarm clock: Beep. Beep. Beep. \n- Dressing: Vest. Badge. Belt. \nOn the bedside table sits the PINK FOX REPELLENT. Judy glances at it and smirks-- taking it would be silly-- she walks out of frame. HOLD on the table. One second. Then Judy's hand comes back into frame and grabs the Repellent. \nINT. ZOOTOPIA POLICE DEPARTMENT - MORNING \nUtter mayhem. COPS parade PERPS through the lobby-- one is wearing cuffs and a plastic (not scary) safety muzzle, he complains to the BEAR COP marching him by. \nLEOPARD C'mon! He bared his teeth first. \nWe land at the front desk and find CLAWHAUSER, a PUDGY CHEETAH COP, happily eating a bowl of Lucky Chomps cereal. \nHOPPS (O.C.) Scuse me! Down here? Hi. \nClawhauser leans over the desk to find Hopps. \nCLAWHAUSER O-M goodness! They really did hire a bunny. What?! (MORE) \nCLAWHAUSER (CONT'D) I gotta tell ya, you are even cuter than I thought you'd be. \nHOPPS (a little wince) Ooo, uh, you probably didn't know, but a bunny can call another bunny \"cute,\" but when other animals do it, it's a little... \nCLAWHAUSER (gasps, realizing) I am so sorry. Me, Benjamin Clawhauser, the guy everyone thinks is just a flabby, donut-loving cop, stereotyping you...? \nHOPPS It's okay-- oh, you've actually you've actually got a-- there's a-- in your neck-- the fold-- the-- there's-- \nClawhauser removes a small donut from under some neck fat. \nCLAWHAUSER Oh, there you went, you little dickens! \nHe crams the donut into his mouth. \nHOPPS (awkwardly laughing) I should get to roll call, so... which way do I? \nCLAWHAUSER Oh! Bullpen's over there to the left. \nHOPPS Great, thank you! \nClawhauser watches admiringly as she heads to the bullpen. \nCLAWHAUSER (to himself, wistful) Aw... That poor little bunny's gonna get eaten alive. \nINT. ZPD - BULLPEN - CONTINUOUS \nHopps enters the bullpen, by far the smallest animal in the room: rhinos, buffalo, hippos, elephants, etc. Hopps holds her paw out to a tough RHINO, MCHORN. \nHOPPS Hey. Officer Hopps. You ready to make the world a better place? \nMcHorn gives Hopps a reluctant fist bump, nearly knocking her off the chair. \nOFFICER HIGGINS (O.S.) TEN HUT! \nIn walks CHIEF BOGO, a gruff CAPE BUFFALO. He takes the dais. Everyone snaps to attention and starts stomping the floor. \nBOGO All right, all right. Everybody sit. \nAs Hopps sits, she disappears below the DESK that is meant for a rhino. \nBOGO (CONT'D) I've got three items on the docket. First... we need to acknowledge the elephant in the room. (nods to ELEPHANT) Francine, happy birthday. \n", "test1_true": "BOGO (CONT'D) Number two: There are some new recruits with us I should introduce. But I'm not going to, because I don't care. Finally... \nHe turns to a push pin-pocked MAP that's covered in photos of MISSING MAMMALS. Hopps's eyes go wide. \nBOGO (CONT'D) ...We have 14 missing mammal cases. All predators, from a giant polar bear, to a teensy little otter. And City Hall is right up my tail to find them. This is priority number one. Assignments! \nHIGGINS hands Bogo a stack of CASE FILES. Bogo puts on his reading glasses, examining the files as he assigns cases. \nBOGO (CONT'D) Officers Grizzoli, Fangmeyer, Delgato-- your teams take Missing Mammals from the Rainforest District. Officers McHorn, Rhinowitz, Wolfard, your teams take Sahara Square. Officers Higgins, Snarlov, Trunkaby: Tundratown. And finally, our first bunny, Officer Hopps. \nHopps sits up, expectant but steely. Bogo looks at the final case file in his hand. He takes a dramatic breath, then: \nBOGO (CONT'D) Parking Duty. Dismissed! \nHOPPS Parking duty? (runs after Bogo) Uh, Chief? Chief Bogo? \nBogo looks around... then down to find Hopps. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Sir, you said there were 14 missing mammal cases? \nBOGO So. \nHOPPS So I can handle one. You probably forgot, but I was top of my class at the academy. \nBOGO Didn't forget. Just don't care. \nHOPPS Sir, I'm not just some \"token\" bunny. \nBOGO Well, then writing a hundred tickets a day should be easy. \nHe goes, slamming the door behind him. Judy stomps her foot. \nHOPPS 100 tickets...? I'm not gonna write 100 tickets... I'm gonna write 200 tickets! (MORE) \nHOPPS (CONT'D) (then, to the closed door) Before noon! \nINT. / EXT. METER MAID CART - DAY \nHopps dons a vest, buckles her seat belt, floors the pedal and... takes off at 2 miles an hour. Which leads to a \nPARKING METER MONTAGE -- \nHopps zooms past a row of cars, marking their tires. Cruising the streets, her super-sensitive ears hear a meter ding. She slams her brakes-- then proudly issues Ticket #1. \nDing! Another meter goes off. Then another. And another. She's on a roll. She looks down at her counter. It's at 200. \nHOPPS Boom! 200 tickets before noon. \nA final ding... Reveal: her own traffic cart is at an expired meter. Hopps rolls her eyes and writes herself a ticket. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) \nAs Hopps puts the ticket on her windshield, she hears a voice across the street: \nTRUCK DRIVER (O.S.) Hey, watch where you're going, Fox! \nHopps looks across the street to see... a RED FOX. Hopps looks at him, a little suspicious. \nThe Fox looks around, then slinks into a caf\u00e9. Hopps runs across the street and peeks in the window. It's an ice cream parlor, but... the FOX IS GONE. \nHOPPS (sotto) Where'd he go... \nINT. JUMBEAUX'S CAFE - MOMENTS LATER \nElephants scoop ice cream with their trunks, suck up nuts with their trunks. It's cute but also disgusting. As Hopps enters, she spots the fox, NICK WILDE, at the front of the line and overhears the proprietor, JERRY, addressing him. \nJERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. Listen, I don't know what you're doing skulking around during daylight hours, but I don't want any trouble in here... So hit the road. \nHopps unsnaps the holster of her PINK FOX REPELLENT. \nNICK I'm not looking for any trouble either, sir. I simply want to buy a Jumbo Pop for my little boy. \nReady for action, slowly creeping forward, Hopps's expression changes when she sees that Nick is with his TODDLER SON. \nNICK (CONT'D) (to the boy) You want the red or the blue, pal? \nStaring at the cute little boy, Hopps is embarrassed by her impulse. She snaps the Repellent holster and begins to leave. \n", "test1_id": 2202, "test2_input": "The door creaks open just an inch. Nick and Hopps seem startled... Hopps slowly pushes the door open, revealing Manchas in the center of the room, hunched over and grunting. \nNICK Buddy? \nHOPPS Are you... okay? \nHopps looks at Manchas. \nRAAAGH!!! Manchas turns, right at them. His eyes are dilated, he's turned savage! He's poised to pounce on Nick and Hopps. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Run. RUN! \nThe Jaguar tears after them, he's deranged, primal. Nick and Hopps run! The jaguar is closing in. \nNICK What is wrong with him?! \nHOPPS I don't know!! \nNick and Hopps run across the bridge. Manchas closes in. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Jump! \nThey jump off the bridge to a lower branch. They duck into a hollow log and Manchas follows them. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) (to Nick) Head down! \nHopps frantically picks up her police radio. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Officer Hopps to dispatch! \nINT. POLICE STATION - DISPATCH - SAME \nWe find Clawhauser showing a handcuffed PERP a video on his phone of pop star Gazelle singing and dancing. A RED LIGHT blinks on the desk phone, but Clawhauser ignores it. \nCLAWHAUSER Are you familiar with Gazelle? Greatest singer of our lifetime-- angel with horns-- okay, hold on, keep watching. Who's that beside her? Who is it? \nReveal: Clawhauser is dancing on stage with Gazelle. \nGAZELLE (ON PHONE) Wow, you are one hot dancer... (digitized robo-voice) ...BENJAMIN CLAWHAUSER. \nCLAWHAUSER (joyous laughter) It's me! Did you think it was real? It looks so real! It's not. It's just a new app. (finally notices ringing phone) Hold on a second-- \nClawhauser clicks the speaker button and-- \nHOPPS (V.O.) CLAWHAUSER! Blue Rev. (mm/dd/yy)                  62. \nEXT. THE CANOPY - SAME \nRAAGH! Manchas takes a swipe at Nick. \nHOPPS Clawhauser, listen to me! We have a 10-91! Jaguar gone savage! Vine and Tu-junja! \nNICK It's Tujunga! \nAs they emerge from the log, Hopps slips, dropping her radio. \nCLAWHAUSER (ON RADIO) Okay, we're sending back up! Hopps? HOPPS?! \nNick and Hopps run, sliding around a corner. Ahead is a gondola station. \nHOPPS There! Head to the skytrams! \nThey run to the gondolas. Hopps darts out of Manchas' way, but slips and is headed off the platform when she manages to grab on-- dangling from the edge. Nick searches for her... \nNICK Get in! Carrots? Carrots! \nHe tries to hold on to the gondola for Hopps, who is struggling to pull herself back onto the platform. \nHOPPS Go! \nAs the gondola pulls away, Nick tries to stop it to no avail. \nNICK No, no, no! \nNick backs up... the jaguar stalks him. \nNICK (CONT'D) Buddy, one predator to another--                      * \n", "test2_true": "NICK (CONT'D) Now, I can tell you're a little tense, so I'm just gonna give you a little personal space-- \nThe jaguar thrashes, knocking Nick and Hopps over the edge. Hopps barely grabs a vine, but struggles to hold Nick in the other hand. As Manchas growls at them from above, Nick looks at the abyss below. Hopps looks around, her mind racing. \nNICK (CONT'D) Rabbit, whatever you do, do not let go! \nHOPPS I'm gonna let go! \nNICK No, you what? No, I said-- listen-- noooo! \nHOPPS One, two-- \nHopps lets go, swinging them over to a netting of vines, kind of on top of each other. They can't believe they're alive. They look at each other, stunned, relieved... \nNICK Carrots. You saved my life. \nHOPPS Well. That's what we do at the ZP... (the branch snaps) Deeeeeeeeeeeee..... \nNick and Hopps plummet. They are about to hit the ground, but a vine attached to their legs stops them right before impact. \nWoo! A convoy of police arrive, screeching in front of them. Out steps... Bogo. Hopps smiles, the cavalry has arrived. \nBOGO Well, this should be good. \nMOMENTS LATER -- \nHopps leads the cops up to the canopy, full of confidence. \nHOPPS I thought this was just a missing mammal case, but it's way bigger. (MORE) \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Mr. Otterton did not just disappear. I believe he and this jaguar, they... went savage, Sir. \nBOGO (scoffing) Savage? This isn't the Stone Age, Hopps. Animals don't go savage. \nHOPPS I thought so too, `til I saw this: \nHopps pulls back some leaves to reveal: the jaguar is gone. There is no sign of him... or his handcuffs. It's like it never happened. Hopps' eyes go wide. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) What? He was right here... \nBOGO (not buying it) The \"savage\" jaguar. \nHOPPS Sir, I know what I saw-- he almost killed us. \nBOGO Or maybe any aggressive predator looks savage to you rabbits. (calls out, to cops) Let's go. \nHOPPS Wait-- Sir, I'm not the only one who saw him! (to Nick) Nick! \nHopps turns to Nick, but before he can explain: \nBOGO (incredulous) You think I'm going to believe a fox? \nHOPPS Well he was a key witness and I enlisted-- \nBOGO (the last straw) Two days to find the otter... (MORE) \nBOGO (CONT'D) or you quit... that was the deal. Badge. \nBogo extends his arm, waiting for Hopps to hand it over. \nHOPPS But, Sir, we... \nBOGO Badge. \nHopps looks at Bogo, then looks at her badge, she's about to reach for it, when... \nNICK (O.S.) Uh, no. \nBogo stops, and glares at Nick. \nBOGO What did you say, fox? \nNICK Sorry, what I said was, \"no.\" She will not be giving you that badge. Look, you gave her a clown vest and a three-wheel joke-mobile and two days to solve a case you guys haven't cracked in two weeks? Yeah, no wonder she needed to get help from a fox, none of you guys were gonna help her, were you? \nHopps looks at Nick, stunned he's sticking up for her. \nNICK (CONT'D) Here's the thing Chief, you gave her the 48 hours, so technically we still have 10 left to find our Mr. Otterton... and that's exactly what we're gonna do, so if you'll excuse us... we have a very big lead to follow and a case to crack. Good day. \n", "test2_id": 2203, "test3_input": "INT. SUBWAY CAR - SAME \nNick and Hopps race away, feeling fairly confident. \nNICK Mission accomplished. Would it be premature for me to do a little victory toot-toot? \nHOPPS All right. One toot-toot. \nNick blows the train whistle. \nNICK Well, I can cross that off the bucket list. \nThings are looking up, when: \nBAM! Woolter just busted into the car. Nick slams the door closed right before Woolter gets to them. \nNICK (CONT'D) I may have to rescind that victory toot-toot. \nNoise from the roof above them... BAM! BAM! BAM! \nNICK (CONT'D) Maybe that's just hail? \nUh-oh. Jesse busts through the window. He's stuck, but flailing at Hopps. Nick tries to pull him away. \nNICK (CONT'D) Back off! \nNick gets punched backward and notices Woolter charging toward the door at full speed. Right before Woolter arrives, Nick pulls the door open. \nNICK (CONT'D) Incoming! \nWoolter's momentum carries him into Jesse-- dislodging him onto the tracks. Hopps is knocked out the window, but grabs onto Woolter's horn. Hopps tries to hang on as the subway car hurtles down the tunnel. \nNICK (CONT'D) Carrots?! \nHOPPS (to Nick) Don't stop! Keep going! \nJESSE (about to get run over) No! No! Please stop! \nHOPPS Do not stop this car! \nJesse dives to safety and Hopps gets bucked up onto the top of the train. Nick takes the wheel as the train emerges above ground. Hopps looks up to see... Another train coming toward them... on the same track! She sees a turn-off switch ahead. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Speed up, Nick! Speed up! \nNICK (staving off Woolter) There's another train coming! \nHOPPS Trust me! SPEED! UP! \nWoolter sees the train coming and tries to get unstuck, but he can't. He struggles like crazy. \nWOOLTER Stop the train! Hey! \nThen, at the last second, Hopps appears next to him: \nHOPPS Hey. Need some help? \nHopps kicks Woolter off the train and he lands perfectly on the turn-off switch on the tracks below. At the last possible second, their train switches tracks-- just avoiding the oncoming car. \nExcept... \nNICK Oh no! Oh no, no, no! Too fast! Hold on! \nThe train derails as it takes the curve. The night howlers catch fire. \nNICK (CONT'D) I think this is our stop! \nHopps and Nick dive out of the car and onto a subway platform... Just as the lab car EXPLODES. \nHOPPS Okay... Maybe some of the evidence survived. \nA second loud EXPLOSION. The train is destroyed. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Everything is gone. We've lost it all. \nNICK (shaking head) Yeah. Oh, except for this. \nNick holds up a case-- containing a gun and a pellet. \n", "test3_true": "Judy SMACKS him on the arm. Hard. Nick grimaces. \nNICK Ow. \nHOPPS Come on! We gotta get to the ZPD. Cut through the Natural History Museum! \nINT. NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM - NIGHT \nNick and Hopps race through the empty museum. The ZPD entrance is just ahead. \nHOPPS Oh! There it is! \nThey're going to make it. \nBELLWETHER (O.S.) Judy! Judy! \nJudy and Nick stop and turn. There's Bellwether, standing behind them with TWO RAM COPS. \nHOPPS Mayor Bellwether! (out of breath, rapidly) We found out what's happening. Someone's darting predators with a serum-- that's what's making them go savage. \nBELLWETHER (applauding) I am so proud of you, Judy. You did just a super job. \nHOPPS Thank you, ma'am. (troubling realization) How did you know where to find us? \nBELLWETHER I'll go ahead and I'll take that case now. \nHOPPS You know what... I think Nick and I will just take this to the ZPD... \nHopps turns toward the ZPD. Uh oh. One of Bellwether's RAMS is blocking the way. Nick just now gets what's going on. \nHOPPS (CONT'D)                          NICK Run!                            Run! \nThey take off-- away from the ZPD-- down a dark corridor. \nBELLWETHER Get them! \nHopps looks over her shoulder as she runs-- not seeing a sharp WOOLY MAMMOTH TUSK sticking out. It slashes her leg, knocking her off her feet. \nHOPPS Ach! \nNICK Ah Carrots! \nNick goes to her. Her leg is bleeding badly. \nNICK (CONT'D) I got ya, come here, come here. \nHe carries her behind a pillar. \nNICK (CONT'D) Okay, now just relax. \nNick digs a handkerchief from his pocket. A few BLUEBERRIES fall out with it. \nNICK (CONT'D) Whoops... Blueberry? \nHOPPS Pass. \nBELLWETHER (O.S.) Come on out, Judy! \nHOPPS Take the case. Get it to Bogo. \nNICK I'm not gonna leave you behind. That's not happening. \nHOPPS I can't walk. \nNICK Just, we'll think of something. \nBellwether finally appears, flanked by the Rams. \nBELLWETHER We're on the same team, Judy! \nWITH BELLWETHER & THUGS -- \nBellwether talks as they look for Hopps and Nick... \nBELLWETHER Underestimated. Under-appreciated. Aren't you sick of it? Predators. They may be strong and loud, but prey out-number predators 10 to one. \nBellwether sees a SHADOW-- RABBIT EARS. She gestures to the RAMS-- there they are. \n", "test3_id": 2204}

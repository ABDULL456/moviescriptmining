It's just, my boy-- (tousles boy's hair) --this goofy little stinker-- he loves all things elephant. Wants to be one when he grows up. \nThe boy gives a TOOT-TOOT with his toy elephant trunk. \nNICK (CONT'D) Isn't it adorable? Who the heck am I to crush his little dreams, huh?

Hey, you're gonna have to wait your turn like everyone else, metermaid. \nHOPPS Actually... (revealing badge) I'm an officer. Just had a quick question. Are your customers aware they're getting snot and mucous with their cookies and cream? \nAn ELEPHANT COUPLE overhear and spit out their ice cream. \nJERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. What are you talkin' about? \nHOPPS Well, I don't wanna cause you any trouble, but I believe scooping ice cream with an un-gloved trunk is a Class 3 Health Code Violation... \nA guilty EMPLOYEE releases a scoop from their trunk. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) ...Which is kind of a big deal. Of course-- I could let you off with a warning if you were to glove those trunks and, I don't know, finish selling this nice dad and his son a... what was it? \nNICK A Jumbo Pop. Please. \nHOPPS A Jumbo Pop. \nJERRY JUMBEAUX, JR. (stews for a beat, then) Fifteen dollars. \nNICK Thank you so much. (to Hopps) Thank you. (then, digs for wallet) Oh no, are you kidding me? I don't have my wallet. I'd lose my head if it weren't attached to my neck, that's the truth. Oh boy, I'm sorry pal. Gotta be about the worst birthday ever. Please don't be mad at me. (kisses him, to Hopps) Thanks, anyway. \nHe turns to go. Hopps slaps some money on the counter. \nHOPPS Keep the change. \nEXT. JUMBEAUX'S CAFE - MOMENTS LATER \nHopps has the Toddler's hand. Nick holds a HUGE JUMBO-POP. \nNICK Officer, I can't thank you enough. So kind, really, can I pay you back? \nHOPPS Oh no, my treat-- it just-- y'know, it burns me up to see folks with such backward attitudes toward foxes. I just wanna say, you're a great dad and just a... a real articulate fella. \nNICK Ah, well, that is high praise. It's rare that I find someone so non- patronizing...

Hey, little toot toot-- \nHopps realizes they are melting their jumbo-pop in the hot sun, channeling the juice into jugs. Huh? Nick and his kid pack the jugs into a van and NICK'S SON gets in the driver's seat. They drive off, passing Hopps, who stares, confused. \nEXT. TUNDRATOWN - A LITTLE LATER \nHopps follows them to... Tundratown, where Nick's \"son\" uses his little paw prints to create molds they pour the popsicle juice into, creating dozens of smaller popsicles. Hopps looks on, scandalized. \nEXT. SAVANNAH CENTRAL - A LITTLE LATER \nHopps watches them resell the \"Pawpsicles\" at marked-up prices to LEMMINGS... when one buys one, they all do. \nNICK Pawpsicles! Get your pawpsicles! \nNick rakes in the cash. As the lemmings leave, they throw their used popsicle sticks into a RECYCLING BIN. A second later, Nick's \"son,\" FINNICK, emerges from the bin with a bundle of used popsicle sticks. Hopps is mortified. \nEXT. LITTLE RODENTIA - A LITTLE LATER \nHopps watches Nick plop down a big bundle of USED POPSICLE STICKS in front of a MOUSE CONSTRUCTION WORKER. \nNICK Lumber delivery! \nMOUSE CONSTRUCTION WORKER What's with the color? \nNICK The color?

You liar! \nNICK It's called a hustle, sweetheart. And I'm not the liar, he is. \nNick points behind Hopps. She turns... no one. She turns back. Nick is gone-- his tail disappears around a corner. \nHOPPS Hey! \nNick walks on, calmly. Hopps hurries up to him. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) Alright, slick Nick, you're under arrest. \nNICK Really, for what? \nHOPPS Gee I don't know, how `bout selling food without a permit, transporting undeclared commerce across borough lines, false advertising... \nNick smiles and produces those documents. \nNICK Permit. Receipt of declared commerce. And I didn't falsely advertise anything. Take care. \nHOPPS You told that mouse the popsicle sticks were redwood! \nNICK That's right. \"Red wood.\" With a space in the middle. Wood that is red. (then) You can't touch me, Carrots, I been doing this since I was born. \nHOPPS You're gonna wanna refrain from calling me Carrots... \nNICK My bad. I just naturally assumed you came from some little carrot- choked podunk, no? \nHOPPS (isn't it obvious?) Ah, no. Podunk is in Deerbrooke County, and I grew up in Bunnyburrow. \nNICK Okay. Tell me if this story sounds familiar: (harsher now, rapidly) Na\u00efve little hick with good grades and big ideas decides, \"Hey lookit me, I'm gonna move to Zootopia-- where Predators and Prey live in harmony and sing Kumbaya!\" Only to find-- whoopsie, we don't all get along. And that dream of becoming a big city cop? Double whoopsie! She's a meter maid. And whoopsie number threesie-- NO ONE cares about her or her dreams. And soon enough those dreams die and our bunny sinks into emotional and literal squalor living in a box under a bridge. Til finally she has no choice but to go back home with that cute, fuzzy wuzzy little tail between her legs to become-- you're from Bunnyburrow, is that what you said?-- so how `bout a carrot farmer... That sound about right? \nShe's speechless-- How did he get my number so quickly? A RHINO almost crushes her. \nNICK (CONT'D) Be careful now, it won't just be your dreams getting crushed. \nHOPPS (ever-so-slightly rattled) Hey! Hey! No one tells me what I can or can't be! Especially not some jerk who never had the guts to try to be anything more than a popsicle hustler! \n", "test1_id": 2202, "test2_input": "BADGER DOCTOR Mayor Lionheart, please, we're doing everything we can. \nHopps whips out her phone, starts recording. \nLIONHEART Really? Cuz I got a dozen and a half animals here who've gone off the rails crazy-- and you can't tell me why. Now, I'd call that awfully far from doing everything. \nBADGER DOCTOR Sir, it may be time to consider their biology. \nLIONHEART What? What do you mean biology? \nBADGER DOCTOR The only animals going savage are predators. We cannot keep it a secret. We need to come forward. \nLIONHEART Hmm... Great idea. Tell the public. And how do you think they're gonna feel about their mayor, who is a lion?! I'll be ruined! \nBADGER DOCTOR Well, what does Chief Bogo say? \nLIONHEART Chief Bogo doesn't know.

The door to the cell Hopps and Nick are in triggers shut. They notice WOLVES approaching. \nNICK Great! We're dead. We're dead. That's it. I'm dead. You're dead. Everybody's dead. \nThis gives Hopps an idea. She looks at the HUGE TOILET. \nHOPPS Can you swim? \nNICK What? Can I swim? Yes, I can swim. Why? \nThe Wolves storm in, searching for the intruders... and see the swirling water of a toilet disappearing down the drain. \nHopps and Nick fly through the water slide like tubes of the sewer system, cascading over a waterfall. Both scream. They land in the river below. Nick pop up first. He looks desperately for Judy. \nNICK (CONT'D) Carrots?! Hopps?! Judy?! \nShe emerges, gasping for breath, holding up the bagged phone. \nHOPPS We gotta tell Bogo! \nINT. BOGO'S OFFICE - DAY \nCLOSE ON BOGO'S PHONE: Gazelle and Bogo dance on stage. It's the same app Clawhauser used earlier. \nGAZELLE (ON PHONE) Wow, you are one hot dancer...

Anything-- \n", "test2_true": "HOPPS You were just trying to protect your job. \nLIONHEART No. Listen, we still don't know why this is happening.

Behind him, POSTERS of the Savage Animals-- each one MUZZLED. \nBOGO Ladies and Gentlemammals... 14 mammals went missing and all 14 have been found by our newest recruit, who will speak to you in a moment. But first, let me remind you-- \nBogo's voice trails off in the background as Nick and Hopps watch from the side. Hopps bites her nails, nervous. \nHOPPS Rrrgh. I am so nervous... \nNICK Okay, press conference 101: You wanna look smart? (MORE) \nNICK (CONT'D) Answer their question with your own question and then answer that question. Like this, \"Excuse me. Officer Hopps, what can you tell us about the case?\" (pretending to be Hopps) \"Well, was this a tough case? Yes. Yes it was.\" You see? \nHOPPS You should be there with me. We did this together. \nNICK Well, am I a cop? No. No, I am not. \nHOPPS Funny you should say that, because I've been thinking... it would be nice to have a partner. \nShe hands Nick an APPLICATION.

(glances at Nick) Are they all different species? Yes. Yes they are. \nNick smiles, gives a thumbs up. \nREPORTER 2 Okay, so what is the connection? \nHOPPS Well, all we know is that they are all members of the predator family. \nANOTHER REPORTER So, predators are the only ones going savage? \nHOPPS That is accu-- Yes, that is accurate. Yes... \nREPORTER 3 Wow. Why is that happening? \nHOPPS We still don't know-- \nMore disappointed rumbling. \nHOPPS (CONT'D) (trying to appease) Ah, it may have something to do with biology. \nOn Nick-- huh? The press reacts, too... big time. \nREPORTER (O.S.) What do you mean by that? \nHOPPS A biological component. You know, something in their DNA... \nREPORTER 4 (more aggressive) In their DNA?

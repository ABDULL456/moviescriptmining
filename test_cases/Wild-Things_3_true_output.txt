Sam smiles.  She points to the stuff beneath his arm. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) Quite a shopping spree... 
She's kidding, then seems to consider how Sam might take it. 
BARBARA (CONT'D) I didn't mean... 
Sam laughs it off. 
SAM Hey, I've got it, I may as well spend it, right?  I've always wanted to live where I could dive for my dinner. 
BARBARA And where might that be? 
SAM I was thinking, Antigua, maybe. 
BARBARA I love Antigua. (beat) Maybe I'll come visit you. 
SAM I'd like that. 
A moment, she touches his face.  Sam raises a hand to cover hers, as... 
... in b.g., a BLACK RANGE ROVER -- just the roof VISIBLE above the tops of the other cars, cruises the lot. 
INT. RANGE ROVER - KELLY VAN RYAN 
seated at the wheel, parks, stares toward the mall entrance. 
ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV 
Sam and Barbara stand in the orange light, hand-in-hand.  Barbara leans forward, kisses Sam on the lips. 
CLOSE ON KELLY 
lost in thought, when she is startled by a sudden CACOPHONY of ENGINE NOISE.  She turns to find... 
Suzie's BUG, SPLUTTERING and BELCHING smoke, parks next to her. 
Suzie opens the door of the Rover, jumps in.  She's wearing a black ball cap, armed with a huge straw bag.  As she settles in the seat, she lets out a long breath. 
Kelly makes a face, fans the air. 
KELLY Jesus.  What are you drinking? 
Suzie laughs, pulls a bottle of Mad Dog 20/20 from the bag. 
KELLY (CONT'D) (looking at the bottle) Anybody ever tell you that stuff will rot your brain? 
SUZIE What brain? 
Suzie takes a big drink.  Kelly shakes her head, looks back toward the entrance. 
ANGLE ON ENTRANCE - KELLY'S POV 
empty.  Sam and Barbara are gone. 
Kelly continues to stare. 
SUZIE What are you looking at? 
KELLY (starting the car) Nothing. 
EXT. THE BEACH - NIGHT 
The Atlantic rolls before a long stretch of empty sand as the last red light drains from the sky. 
The Range Rover comes down onto the sand, parks. 
INT./EXT. RANGE ROVER - SAME 
Kelly turns off the engine.  Suzie tokes on a joint, swills the MD 20/20.  She gazes upon the sea, eyes at half-mast. 
SUZIE I thought we were goin' to a movie. 
KELLY I think we just need to get wasted. 
Suzie shrugs, gets out.  Kelly gets out with her.  Suzie staggers.  Kelly circles her with an arm, looks nervously around, begins leading her down the beach. 
SUZIE I wanna live at the beach someday. 
KELLY Shit. 
She stops walking.  Suzie takes a few more steps then turns to look at her. 
KELLY (CONT'D) I left the keys.  I'll get 'em. 
Suzie plops down on the sand, drinks from the bottle.  She watches Kelly fading into the darkness, mumbles something beneath her breath, then lies on her back. 
SUZIE'S POV - THE NIGHT SKY 
The SOUND of CRASHING WAVES.  She rolls to one side, looking down the beach

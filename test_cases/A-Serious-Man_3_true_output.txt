LARRY Not just physics. Morally. 
CLIVE Yes. 
LARRY And we both know about your actions. 
CLIVE No sir. I know about my actions. 
LARRY I can interpret, CLIVE. I know what you meant me to understand. 
CLIVE Meer sir my sir. LARRY cocks his head. 
LARRY . Meer sir my sir? 
CLIVE (careful enunciation) Mere... surmise. Sir. He gravely shakes his head. . Very uncertain. 
CLOSE ON A TONE ARM A hand lays it onto a slowly spinning vinyl record. Through scratches and pops, a solo tenor starts a mournful Hebrew chant. Close on the sleeve: Rabbi Youssele Rosenblatt Chants Your Haftorah Portion 
VOLUME 12 Rabbi Youssele wears a caftan and a felt hat and has sad eyes. They peer out from the dark beard that covers most of the rest of his face like owl's eyes peering out of the woods. Wider, on DANNY, in his bedroom, evening. He lifts the tone arm on the portable turntable. He chants the passage. He drops the tone arm at the same place; Rabbi Youssele chants the passage again. DANNY listens, eyes narrowed. He lifts the tone arm and chants the passage again. He replays the passage again; before he can lift the tone arm to echo it his door bursts open. Rabbi Youssele continues to chant. 
SARAH You little brat fucker! You snuck twenty bucks out of my drawer! 
DANNY Studying torah! Asshole! 
SARAH You little brat! I'm telling Dad! 
DANNY Oh yeah? You gonna tell him you've been sneaking it out of his wallet? 
SARAH All right, you know what I'm gonna do? You little brat? If you don't give it back? We hear the thunk of the front door opening. DANNY stands, calling: 
DANNY Dad? 
FOYER LARRY is entering with his briefcase. As he stows it in the foyer closet DANNY's voice continues, off: 
DANNY Dad, you gotta fix the aerial. Judith emerges from the kitchen. 
JUDITH Hello LARRY, have you thought about a lawyer? 
LARRY Honey, please! DANNY emerges from the hall. 
DANNY 
We're not getting channel four at all. 
LARRY (to Judith) Can we discuss it later? 
DANNY I can't get F Troop.

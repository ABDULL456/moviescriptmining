It's Carter, who ran to the sound of the gunshot, and TRIPPED Hu Li with his leg. 
CARTER All right, get your hands up. 
Hu Li backflips up -- kicking Carter in the head. 
EXT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS 
Lee takes down Bodyguard #1, but is still fighting three on one.  A furious exchange of acrobatic blows between Lee and Bodyguard #2. 
INT. SHIP'S HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS 
Carter and Hu Li face off. 
CARTER You wanna piece of me?  C'mon, I'll give you a little LAPD ass kickin'. 
Hu Li savages Carter with a series of punishing blows. 
INT. UPPER DECK - CONTINUOUS 
Lee manages to defeat Bodyguards #3 and #4.  As he catches his breath the sound of a SPEED BOAT starting its engines. 
LEE Hu Li! 
Lee runs to the rail -- looks down to see a SPEEDBOAT starting to pull away from the ship.  Hu Li jumps onboard the moving boat. 
Lee starts to turn for the stairs, running down towards the stern. EXT. YACHT - STERN - CONTINUOUS 
Lee and Carter run up to the stern at the same time -- watching helplessly as Hu Li gets away in the speed boat. 
Carter turns his head, sees -- 
-- STEVEN REIGN at the other end of the boat, watching Hu Li escape, not at all behaving like a panicky billionaire should during a gangland shooting.  Wordlessly, Reign disappears back into the shadows. 
EXT. DOCK - NIGHT 
The yacht is anchored.  A few TRIADS led away in handcuffs. Thrown into PATROL CARS that have surrounded the docks. 
Sterling, Chin, Lee and Carter on the dock. 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING Quite a night, Inspector.  Ricky Tan was our only bait, and now he's gone.  You finally got your revenge - at the expense of a U.S. Government investigation. 
CARTER What "revenge" is he talking about? 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING I don't know if the Fu-Cang-Long paid you to get rid of Tan, or whether it was a pure vendetta killing -- but you're off this case.  I don't ever want to see you again, you got that? 
CARTER Hey, you, Secret Service Man, what are you -- 
SPECIAL AGENT STERLING Stay out of it, Carter.  You're going back to L.A. 
CARTER Fine with me. 
Sterling walks away disgusted. 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN I'm sorry Lee, but my orders are to fully cooperate with the Secret Service. 
Lee nods a respectful but bitter acknowledgment.  Chin motions for two uniformed Hong Kong police officers to approach. 
SUPERINDENDENT CHIN (CONT'D) (to police officers) Escort Detective Carter to the airport -- 
LEE I'll take him. 
CARTER Hell no. 
The Hong Kong police officers produce HANDCUFFS.  Beat. 
CARTER (CONT'D) (to Lee) Fine.  But don't expect me to talk to you.

ARTHUR My wife. 
BEVILACQUA Yeah... me too. I wasn't even home. She decided to push it when I wasn't around to stop her. 
ARTHUR And now she's dead. Did you kill her? 
BEVILACQUA I don't want to talk about it. 
ARTHUR Where are you taking me? Bevilacqua retrieves a NASA DOSSIER from the dashboard and hands it to Arthur. 
BEVILACQUA Kenneth Weller. You know him? 
ARTHUR Name sounds familiar. Does he work at Langley too? 
BEVILACQUA Yep. He's next. Him and his wife... they've got the box now. Suddenly... BLUE AND RED LIGHTS appear behind them... followed by the sound of a SIREN. 
EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT 
TWO POLICE CRUISERS are now tailing the pick-up truck. 
INT. WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK -- NEXT 
Bevilacqua steps on the gas... accelerating to outrun them. 
ARTHUR What are you doing? 
BEVILACQUA I'm not gonna let them get me... Arthur... we've got to get to Kenneth Weller. We've got to break the chain... or your wife is gonna die! 
ARTHUR How is she going to die? 
BEVILACQUA You're going to kill her! Bevilacqua swerves into the ONCOMING TRAFFIC LANE to pass a car in front of them. A LARGE 18-WHEELER TRUCK is barreling toward them. Bevilacqua pulls the truck back into the right lane. 
EXT. 1-95 -- NEXT 
The 18 WHEELER slams on the brakes... then jack-knives to the left... blocking both lanes... One of the POLICE CRUISERS pulls off into the ditch... while the second CRUISER swerves and SMASHES head on into the side of the truck bed... sheering the top of the sedan into two pieces... 
INT. WHITE PICK-UP TRUCK -- NEXT 
Arthur looks back over his shoulder... seeing the cars smash together. 
ARTHUR Jesus! You're gonna get us killed! 
BEVILACQUA Did Steward take you to the library? Did you meet his mother... the librarian? 
ARTHUR Yeah. 
BEVILACQUA Did she tell you about Prometheus? 
ARTHUR Yeah... 
BEVILACQUA Steward has a twin brother... and he works for the CIA. UP AHEAD... Arthur sees FOUR MORE POLICE CRUISERS with their lights flashing. They have formed a ROADBLOCK. Bevilacqua lowers his foot onto the accelerator... refusing to back down. 
BEVILACQUA (CONT'D) This is purgatory... we're living in purgatory... 
EXT. 1-95 -- NIGHT 
The WHITE TRUCK smashes through the line of POLICE CRUISERS as POLICE OFFICERS dive for cover. An officer raises his GUN and fires off several rounds toward the truck. A BULLET explodes the right front tire... The truck swerves and FLIPS OVER onto one side... tumbling over and over along the interstate in a horrific crash. ONCOMING CARS swerve into ditches... and the white truck comes sliding to a stop on the wet pavement. The CAMERA slowly approaches the smoking wreckage... catching a glimpse of Bevilacqua... his face covered in blood. Arthur remains hidden from sight. 
EXT. VIRGINIA HOUSE -- DRIVEWAY -- MOMENTS LATER 
Norma rushes down the sidewalk on the perimeter of the square... searching for her son. 
NORMA Walter? A BLACK SEDAN pulls up next to her... and Reston steps out of the car. Norma locks eyes with him... recognizing his face... 
RESTON Mrs. Lewis? Norma Lewis? 
NORMA Yes.

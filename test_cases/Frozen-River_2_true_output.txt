Lila perches in a tree nearby with a can of Pringles potato chips dropping every other one on the ground below where a huge WHITE DOG, part wolf, takes his share. 
From the tree Lila looks inside the window of the house where: 
A baby boy, "LITTLE JAKE," about a year old, bangs his spoon on his high chair tray then throws it down. 
EVELYN LITTLEWOLF, 48, a tall thin Mohawk woman with long hair pulled back, picks it up and gives it back to him. 
He throws it again. She knows the game. She gives it back, but the third time she holds it just out of his reach and laughs at him. He bangs his fists on the tray. 
Lila drinks in the sight. 
Abruptly, the DOOR OPENS and EVELYN leans out. 
EVELYN Chance! Chance, get in here before you freeze your ass off. 
The White Dog looks up at Lila who shakes the Pringles can upside down to show it's empty. 
Chance goes inside. The door SHUTS behind him. 
Lila stuffs a wad of cash in the can and jumps down from the tree. She leaves it near the front door and hurries into the woods. 
CUT TO: 
57   INT. T.J. AND RICKY'S BEDROOM -   NIGHT                     57 
Ray tucks Ricky into the bottom bunk. The wind whines in the loose siding. Ray stuffs a blanket around the window to block the draft. 
58   INT. RAY'S TRAILER, LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                     58 
Ray walks through the kitchen now full of groceries and opens a can of Adirondack Cola. The remains of two Hungry Man dinners sit on the table. 
She sits down in the living room. T.J. watches the local weather. 
WEATHER MAN (O.S.) Temps will dip tonight and tomorrow. Expect a Clipper from Northern Ontario to bring 8 to 12 inches of snow and winds gusting 25-45 miles an hour making it feel like minus 30. Area farmers are advised to bring in livestock. More on this after a message. 
A blaring TV commercial for the "HOT WHEELS TECH TRAX AIR STUNT CHALLENGE SET" comes on. 
T.J. That's what he wants. 
RAY What? 
He points at the TV. 
T.J. For Christmas. 
RAY What is it, again? 
T.J. (recites it quick) Hot Wheels Tech Trax Air Stunt Challenge Set. 
RAY -Hot Wheels Tech Trax, what? 
T.J. Air-Stunt-Challenge-Set. 
RAY I got something even better than that. 
T.J. What? 
RAY The double wide. But don't mention it to Ricky, just in case. 
T.J. Yeah, "just in case." 
RAY This time is for real. 
T.J. Is that why you bought Calgon Bath Stuff? 
RAY Yes it is. We're getting a tub, T.J. It's gonna happen. 
T.J. Yeah, right. 
RAY If you keep that attitude I'll never let you use it. 
T.J. Be afraid. Be very afraid. (a moment) What about Dad? 
RAY What about him? 
T.J. What are you gonna do? 
RAY Why, did he call broke yet? 
T.J. No, but maybe he would call if you weren't so bitter. 
RAY Oh, here we go again with Saint Dad. 
T.J. That's what I mean. You're always on him. "Where's your paycheck, do you need a meeting, give me your receipts." 
RAY He's an addict, T.J.

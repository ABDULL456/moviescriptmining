52 CONTINUED: (2) 52 Ray, Davis and Clemens head away. Solomon seems both desperate and hopeful of some aid from Clemens and Ray. But there is none forthcoming. Ray and Clemens continue on - Clemens not so much as even looking back in Solomon's direction. Solomon stands and watches as they fade into the environs and are gone from sight. 
EXT. NEW ORLEANS/PORT - LATER 
Hours later. The slaves sit off on one side of the dock, baking in the sun, awaiting their fate. THEOPHILUS FREEMAN - a tall, thin-faced man with light complexion and a little bent - moves along the deck calling out names from a list. The slaves STAND as they are called. 
FREEMAN Oren. John. Lethe. Eliza. Randall. Emily. Platt... Platt! Solomon does not respond. Freeman looks around. He spots Solomon. 
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Captain, who shipped that nigger? 
CAPTAIN Burch. Freeman steps to Solomon. He gives him a looking over. 
FREEMAN Stand up. Solomon does as told. 
FREEMAN (CONT'D) You fit the description given. Why didn't you answer when called? 
SOLOMON My name is not Platt. My name is-- Freeman strikes Solomon hard across the face. 
FREEMAN Your name is Platt, and I will teach you your name so that you don't forget. (to the Captain) Shackle my niggers. Get them to my cart. 
54 I/E. CART - LATER 54 Solomon is carted off along with the rest of "Burch's stock:" Eliza and her children, John and Solomon. As they move off from the port in a make-shift cart, it opens up to the frenzic, busy port. For the first time Solomon sees true and severe slavery. These are not visiting servants, such as Jasper was back in Saratoga. These are humans held in strict bondage - herded like cattle, chained together as if in a "chain gang." Slaves are evident not merely by the color of their skin. The residue and accessories of slavery are everywhere. Blacks almost universally display scars - 
THICK AND HEAVY DEAD TISSUE FROM LACERATIONS LEFT UNTREATED - brands, and are often missing limbs. Blacks are held in all types of shackles, from simple chains to elaborate bindings, to neck collars that are spiked. Some are muzzled or forced to wear bits. One slave is attacked by a dog and the slave owner. The dog pulls and tears at the slave's clothes. THESE IMAGES SHOULD BE A 
CONSTANT AND CONTINUAL CANVAS TO THE PIECE. EVER 
PRESENT, BUT NOT REALLY COMMENTED ON AS THEY ARE THE NORM. They should be a reminder that not only are people being oppressed, but that there is an entire system of oppression in place. 
EXT. FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER 
"Burch's stock:" arrive at Freeman's slave pen. They are led in by Freeman and his house slave CAPE - a mulatto. The yard is enclosed by plank, standing upright, with ends sharpened instead of brick walls as with Burch's. Including Burch's group there are about 30 SLAVES in the pen. Solomon and the others look around and see nothing but downtrodden and despondent faces. Three men sit next to each other with muzzles and quietly stare back at this new batch of arrivals. One attempts to speak, but all that comes out is a muffled, unintelligible sound. 
EXT. FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER 
The slaves are in various states of undress, men and women alike. They clean themselves, scrubbing with soap and water. Women wash their hair. Men shave, skin is oiled. Freeman walks among them, inspecting them as they primp themselves. 
INT. FREEMAN'S SLAVE PEN - LATER 
The slaves are given new clothes by Cape. The men are given hat, coat, shirt, pants and shoes. The women 
(CONTINUED) 
57 CONTINUED: 57 frocks of calico and handkerchiefs to bind about their heads. 
58 INT. FREEMAN'S/GREAT ROOM - LATER 58 
It's an odd, ironic scene. The slaves are in a large and fairly ornate room within Freeman's house. CAPE PLAYS A PAINFUL TUNE ON A FIDDLE - background music - as Freeman tries to line up A SMALL GROUP OF THE SLAVES, he becomes less patient, jittery and nervous, knowing that his livelihood is at stake, he wants his slaves to make a good impression. Sometimes his patience gets the better of him, and his hands move freely in direction of the slaves. The business has the air of an etiquette class, though what Freeman is trying to do is coach the slaves into being more "sellable." He works with them in groups of five or so. 
FREEMAN Tallest to smallest, understand? Are you taller than her? Then you'd go before her. Do it. Move. (to the group) Keep your heads up. A sense of direction; that's how you look smart. None of those saucer eyes. Rid yourself of that smile. Look like a goddamn grinnin' monkey. Put the least thought in your head. C'mon, now. Think of somethin'. Weary of Cape's playing, Solomon moves to Cape. He asks: 
SOLOMON Can you play a reel? 
CAPE 
(DISMISSIVE) Nah. I don't know no reel. 
SOLOMON If I may...? Cape looks to Freeman: 
FREEMAN He sick of your caterwaulin'. Let him play, boy. Let's see what he can do. Cape reluctantly hands the fiddle over to Solomon. Solomon tunes it a bit, then begins to play. His fingers stiff at first, he takes a moment to warm up. But as he warms up he is, despite the circumstances, masterful. 
(CONTINUED) 
58 CONTINUED: 58 THE SLAVES ALL CLAP ALONG. SOME DANCE ALONG. All admire his work. Freeman chief among them. 
FREEMAN (CONT'D) Keep on. Keep on. Solomon continues to play. 
FREEMAN (CONT'D) A damn sight better than you, Cape. A damn sight better. Cape looks bitter as Solomon plays on. 
INT. FREEMAN'S/GREAT ROOM - DAY 
We come in on an odd sort of sight; A JUMBLE OF ACTIVITY. CUSTOMERS have come to see Freeman's lot - the room all gussied up with flowers. Freeman moves among them, displaying them as a rancher would prize chattel. Freeman makes the slaves hold their heads up - "look smart" as he previously admonished them. They are made to walk briskly back and forth while customers feel their hands and arms and bodies, turn them about and ask what skills they possess. The Customers routinely make the slaves open their mouths and show their teeth. At times a MALE or FEMALE SLAVE are taken off to the side, stripped and inspected more minutely. One of them, John, is stripped and inspected. Cape, as he's done previously, plays his fiddle. A buyer - WILLIAM FORD; a man of middle age, and an attractive nature in his tone of voice - consults a list he's drawn up and asks of Freeman: 
FORD What is the price for the ones Platt and Eliza? 
FREEMAN A thousand for Platt; he is a nigger of talent. Seven hundred for Eliza. My fairest price.

PRINCE PHILIP stands by a barbecue, struggling to get the fire to light. The QUEEN MOTHER is in another corner.. A LAND ROVER pulls up. The QUEEN gets out with her dogs. She notices PHILIP's struggle with the bar-be-cue.. 
ELIZABETH Those fire-lighters no good? carrying tupperware boxes) I brought some stew just in case. I think it's lamb. We could always have that cold.. 
PRINCE PHILIP No, we'll be all right. 
he QUEEN throws some food to her dogs, but makes several hand gestures forbidding them to eat. The DOGS salivate, and whimper, but dutifully show their forbearance. Staring at the food. 
The QUEEN, meanwhile, starts setting places at the table with plates, knives and forks.. 
ELIZABETH Robin had a call from the Prime Minister. Who expressed his concern. 
HILIP turns, an exasperated look.. 
PRINCE PHILIP About WHAT? 
ELIZABETH The flag above Buckingham Palace. He thinks it should be flying at half- mast. 
The DOGS continue to P whimper hungrily. 
RINCE PHILIP Then I hope Robin told him there ISN'T a flag above Buckingham Palace... (angrily jabs coals with a long, sharp fork) ...only the Royal Standard, which flies for one reason only. (MORE) 
PRINCE PHILIP(cont'd) To denote the presence of the Monarch. Since you're here, the flag pole is bare. Which is as it should be. 
HARLES clears his throat.. 
CHARLES Isn't it possible..that to some people...the Royal Standard is just.. ..a flag? And that the flap pole being bare sends out the wrong signal. 
The QUEEN turns. A withering look.. 
ELIZABETH That's not the point. 
RINCE PHILIP The point is it's more than four hundred years old. It has never been lowered for ANYONE.. 
QUEEN MOTHER Your grandfather didn't get that flag at half-mast when he died and if your mother were to die tomorrow, she wouldn't get it either. 
CHARLES Yes...but sometimes...in a situation like this..one has to be flexible.. 
All heads turn. And stare at CHARLES. 
CHARLES (shrugs) It is just a flag. 
ELIZABETH "What about the Union Jack?", was Mr. Blair's next suggestion. 
UEEN MOTHER (rolling eyes) Oh, for heaven's sake. 
PRINCE PHILIP The next thing he'll be suggesting you change your name to Hilda and mine to Hector? angry gesture) Who does he think he's talking to? You're the Sovereign. The Head of State. You don't get dictated to. a beat) You've conceded the idea of a public funeral. You've opened up the parks. That's ENOUGH. 
The QUEEN indicates to PHILIP to keep his voice down, to avoid upsetting the BOYS, who are still fishing.. 
PRINCE PHILIP (cont'd) You wait. In forty-eight hours it was all have calmed down. 
ELIZABETH Like those condolence books. 
PRINCE PHILIP Quite right. (a defiant snort) When we started with one, everyone predicted they would grow and grow. But we've heard nothing more about that, see? 
CHARLES clears his throat..

CHARLES crosses the saloon to his study, talking to his Private Secretary. 
HARLES In one sense its comforting. a beat) For the first time my parents can see what it's been like for me all these years, being up against her popularity. (a beat) But they're still making the mistake of thinking the Diana they knew from living and dealing with her, will eventually be the one seen by the public. But it's not. The two Dianas, theirs and ours, bear no relation to one another at all. 
CHARLES looks at LAMPORT..

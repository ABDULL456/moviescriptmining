VOICES Daddy... Daddy...Daaaddyyy...Daddy.. THE VOICES ARE HORRIFIC AND TERRIFYING. Big Bob backs up pointing his gun in their direction. 
VOICES (CONT'D) Daaaaddyyy...Dad-dy...Dad-dy... 
BIG BOB Who's there? 
VOICES Dad-dy...Dad-dy...Daddy...Dad-dy... Big Bob can't contain his fear and shoots blindly into the darkness. 
BIG BOB Who's there? Show yourself! The voices become louder and louder, omnipresent. 
VOICES Dad-dy...Dad-dy...Daaaddyyy... Daddy.. Daddy... Big Bob walks backwards to the truck, and trips on the ground. Wide eyed, he stands and throws himself on the car door. 
45 INT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 45 
Panicked, he enters the vehicle and turns the ignition. As the engine turns over- 
A DEEP VOICE RIGHT BEHIND HIM- 
VOICE 
(CALMLY) ..Daddy... In a split second, Big Bob sees, in his rear view mirror, A 
DARK HAIRY FIGURE WITH EVIL EYES IN THE BACKSEAT- It's PAPA JUPITER. 
46 EXT. PICK-UP TRUCK - NIGHT 46 
BIG BOB'S FACE SLAMS REPEATEDLY INTO THE WINDSHIELD! The truck shakes as Big Bob is attacked inside. Blood splatters on the windows. 
47 EXT. MINE ENTRANCE - NIGHT 47 
Bloodied and screaming, Big Bob is dragged out of the car in the dirt to the entrance of the old mine behind the gas station. Big Bob disappears inside. The night is once again calm and silent. 
FADE TO BLACK. 
49 INT. TRAILER - NIGHT 49 
Miles away, inside the trailer, Ethel washes dishes while dinner cooks on the stove. 
SUDDENLY THE RED LIGHT ON THE C/B TURNS ON AND THE RADIO 
SQUAWKS TO LIFE, DISRUPTING THE SILENCE. She wipes her hands on her apron and site down next to the radio. 
ETHEL (into the mic) Hello...Hello... Can somebody hear me? Please answer if you hear me. Hello? No answer. The radio goes silent. Lynn joins her, holding the baby. 
LYNN How's it going? 
ETHEL I heard something. She fiddles with the radio. 
ETHEL (CONT'D) I'm not even sure I know how to use this thing. Lynn hands her Catherine, and sits in front of the C/B. 
(CONTINUED)

LYNN (in the mic) Mayday ...mayday... This is a distress call... Do you copy? Still nothing.

ARTHUR I like to buy off all the railroads. 
Harry is slightly annoyed at Vada distracting them 
HARRY Vada, we're trying to work here. 
CAMPER PULLS UP OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS HOUSE 
BASEMENT 
VADA Cruella deville stole all the puppies, she was gonna make a fur out of 'em! 
HARRY (to Arthur) Hand me the canula. 
Vada begins to sing doo-wah-diddy-diddy, Arthur joins in 
HARRY (annoyed) VADA! 
VADA Dad? 
HARRY I'm embalming my high school teacher, don't sing. (beat) All right Arthur, just a slide of the needle..... (fades out as Vada climbs stairs) 
Vada climbs stairs and stops to read patient note, CAUSE OF DEATH - CANCER OF PROSTATE 
HARRY (to corpse) One nice model C-501 bronze stainless eternal journey, yeah, you look like a champion. 
OUTSIDE SULTENFUSS' HOUSE DAY, STRANGE WOMAN GETS OUT OF CAMPER, WALKS UP TO DOOR AND RINGS BELL, VADA ANSWERS 
STRANGER Is Mr. Harry Sultenfuss in? 
VADA Sure, come on in. 
Vada and strange woman make their way to a desk in the foyer, and sit down 
So, have you had the unfortunate experience of recently losing a loved one? 
STRANGER (puzzled look) Could I see your Dad, just for a second? 
Vada runs across to call downstairs 
VADA DAD, SOMEBODY'S HERE!! 
Vada runs back to the desk 
He's downstairs working on Mr. Layton. Prostate Cancer. Once it hits your prostate, you're a goner. 
STRANGER Oh. 
Harry enters 
HARRY How may I... Help you? 
STRANGER I'm Shelly devoto. We spoke, the other day regarding the make up artist job. 
HARRY Oh yes. 
SHELLY It's still available I hope? 
HARRY I think it's still available. 
SHELLY I'm a licensed cosmetologist, I worked for two years, at the "Dino Raphael" Salon, all my customers cried when I told them I was leaving. 
HARRY Uhh, Miss devoto... 
SHELLY I have a wonderful disposition, I put people right at ease.

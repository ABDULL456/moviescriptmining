JAMES What the hell does that mean? 
ELDRIDGE Healthy. 
JAMES You're healthy? Well, why not. 
They go back to eating. 
Sanborn joins James and Eldridge. 
SANBORN What's up team? 
They nod silently as he sits. Sluggishly he throws his hand down on the table. 
SANBORN Can I get a Huu-haa? 
Eldridge slaps a tired hand on top of Sanborn's. James follows suit. They wearily lift their arms in mock enthusiasm. 
All at once:   "Huu-haa." 
Sanborn wolfs down some food. 
JAMES I'm going back to sleep now. 
ELDRIDGE Let's roll. 
They get up to bus their trays. And nearing the dirty-tray bin, the flaps of the tent billow more and more vigorously. Outside, a storm is brewing. 
Each man unfurls the checkered scarf around their neck and wraps their face for the wind. 
EXT CAMP VICTORY    DAY 
Wind rakes sand and dust over the tent city, giving it an otherworldly aspect. Throngs of men and vehicles fight the swirl. It impedes their every move. 
The three men continue onwards, as the intensity of the storm grows. 
EXT HEAD SHED DAY 
The storm is HOWLING now. Visibility is reduced to a few feet. Red sand blows mercilessly. It's Mars. 
TITLE OVER: 
DAYS LEFT IN BRAVO COMPANY'S ROTATION: 16 
As they approach the head shed, a Humvee comes blasting out of the storm from the other direction. It skids to a halt in front of them. 
Three wounded EOD TECHS and an EOD TEAM LEADER tumble out. 
They look awful. One step shy of death. One man's face is smeared brown. Blood oozes from a deep gash in his cheek. Another tech is covered in black soot. Their hands still clutch their weapons -- the battle still wages in their minds. 
TEAM LEADER (shouting to James) It was a car bomb. Fucking nasty one -- they had a decoy detonator set up so that when I disarmed it nothing happened -- then, I'm walking back uprange to get some more tools and boooom!!! If I hadn't been wearing the suit, I'd be dead right now. 
ELDRIDGE Get a Medic to look at your cheek. 
The wounded TEAM LEADER touches his face and blood smears on his hand...he looks down...surreal to see your own blood. The First Sergeant trots over. 
TEAM LEADER (amazed at the sight of HIS BLOOD) ) It's no big deal. (now turning his attention back to James) ) Be careful. They're starting to hide the detonator really well. 
The FIRST SERGEANT turns his attention to James: 
FIRST SERGEANT Sorry to ruin your day off, but your team is up. 
James blinks back sand and dust blowing into his eyes. 
So much for the nap. 
INT HUMVEE    CAMP VICTORY   PARKING LOT 
Lt. COL. CAMBRIDGE knocks on the window. Startling the men. His face appears in the sand storm. 
LT. COL. CAMBRIDGE (SHOUTING) Are you guys about to go out? 
JAMES Yeah. 
LT. COL. CAMBRIDGE Mind if I ride along? I'm sick to death of sitting behind a desk all the time. 
James shoots Eldridge a look.   Eldridge shrugs. 
JAMES Anytime, Sir. It's a privilege. 
The LT. COL. CAMBRIDGE gets in. As they drive out. 
JAMES Don't mean to insult your intelligence, Sir. But if the shit hits the fan, please don't fire out of these windows. They're bullet proof and the round will just bounce around the cabin. 
EXT. ABU GRAIB CENTER   BOMBED OUT BUILDING   DAY 
A partially destroyed building fills the screen. A mess of bricks and rebar. Wind swirls sand up into the air. 
Nearby, an OLD IRAQI MAN with a DONKEY drawn cart is unloading new bricks to repair the building. 
Farther up the road, a good distance from the building, are two parked Humvees. Nearby, James and his team are talking to a small cluster of SOLDIERS. 
SOLDIER 1 (pointing back at the BUILDING) Right up those stairs. 
JAMES You been inside already? 
SOLDIER 1 In there? Fuck no. We've had reports of all kinds of shit coming out of that house -- and-- 
James takes his eyes off the building and turns to the Soldier.

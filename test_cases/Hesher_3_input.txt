It's raining hard. TJ storms out, just as Hesher is making his way up the path, his van parked on the street behind him. Hesher reaches out his arm to slow TJ. 
HESHER I wanna talk to you. 
TJ pushes Hesher's arm out of the way. 
TJ Get your fucking hands away from me! I told you, I never want to see you again. 
Hesher, at a loss, watches TJ grab a brick from the muddy garden and throw it through the passenger side window of his van. 
Hesher charges TJ. He throws him into the muddy garden and kneels over him holding him by the collar of his hooded sweatshirt. 
HESHER I fuckin' told you, leave my van out of this! 
Hesher lifts TJ up and slams him back down on the ground, knocking the wind out of him. TJ struggles to get away. 
TJ Let go of me! Fuckin' let go of me. 
Dad runs out the front door and pulls Hesher off TJ by the back of his shirt. 
DAD What in God's name - 
Hesher shakes free from Dad's grip and punches him square in the nose. Dad goes down hard. 
HESHER Don't fuckin' touch m- 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
Without hesitation, TJ jumps on Hesher's back, bear hugging his face. They struggle for a beat, until Hesher manages to throw TJ off. He lands on the wet grass like a ragdoll. 
HESHER (CONT'D) Fuck you both! Motherfuckers! 
Hesher stands breathing hard, dripping wet from the rain, fists clenched. 
He turns back to his van, gets in, slams the door and peels away. TJ picks himself up out of the mud, grabs his bike and rides off in the opposite direction. Dad stands holding his bloody nose. He watches Hesher, he watches TJ. He is left confused and bleeding in the pouring rain. 
EXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - NIGHT 
It's raining cats and dogs. TJ stands outside Dustin's house, soaking wet with his hoodie pulled over his head, the garden shears in his hand. 
He walks around the side of the house and looks in the window. 
INT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
From TJ's POV outside, we see Dustin in the kitchen preparing a sandwich, one eye on the TV. He takes the sandwich to the couch in front of the TV and lies down. 
EXT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
TJ walks around the back of the house. He tries the handle to the back door. It's locked. TJ sees the dog door. He climbs through the flap, trying to be as quiet as possible. The TV is loud inside. 
INT. DUSTIN'S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS 
TJ treads softly through the kitchen, soaking wet, shears poised. 
He walks through to the living area. He steps behind the couch out of Dustin's line of sight. Dustin's bare feet hang off the end of the couch. 
TJ ducks down. He opens the shears and carefully brings them down over Dustin's big toe. He squeezes them shut... 
Dustin squeals. 
(CONTINUED) CONTINUED: 
TJ Where's my car? 
DUSTIN What are you doing!? 
TJ Where's my fucking car? 
DUSTIN Are you crazy?! 
TJ You make me ask one more time, your toe's coming off. I swear to God. 
DUSTIN It's gone to the wrecker's. 
TJ What? 
DUSTIN The wrecking yard. 
TJ Bullshit. 
TJ squeezes a little harder. Dustin squeals a little louder. 
DUSTIN Why would I be lying? 
TJ Because you're a fucking asshole. Tell me where it is. 
DUSTIN It's gone to the wrecker's. I swear to God. 
TJ squeezes harder. Dustin squeals.

MARTIN I freaked out, joined the Army, worked for the government, and went into business for myself... I'm a professional killer. 
PAUL Thank you. 
Paul, satisfied, gets back on the road. 
PAUL Professional killer, huh? Does that come with a good HMO? 
EXT. ROAD - DAY 
Paul makes a turn. They approach a large car dealership. The sign above it says 
"DESTEPHANO'S BAVARIAN MOTOR WORKS" 
MARTIN (looking ahead) He sells BMW's? 
PAUL He sold me this bad boy. 
MARTIN How could you put your hard-earned dollars into the hands of the class bully? 
PAUL He gave me a great deal. 
MARTIN Mein Dealer. 
Paul slows outside the lot. BOB DESTEPHANO-- a big, angry- looking man in an expensive suit-- stands in the lot, puffing up amidst his stable of expensive cars. 
PAUL Hey! Bob! The car's running great. 
BOB (dismissive) Glad to hear it. 
Bob turns his back on them and begins to walk away. 
MARTIN (shouts) Bob... 
BOB (turning) What? 
MARTIN It's me. Martin Blank. 
BOB Really...? So what? 
MARTIN Okay. See you later. 
EXT. RADIO STATION - NIGHT 
Martin climbs out of Paul's car and begins to walk toward his own. Paul calls after him. 
PAUL See you at the left-a-boy-came-back- a-man-made-good party. 
Martin nods him off. Paul pulls away. 
MARTIN 
stands across the street from the radio station, looking at Debi in the window... Martin draws a thin rifle scope from his back pocket, and lifts it to his eye... 
MARTIN'S P.O.V. - SCOPE 
of Debi, in the crosshairs, bored, tapping a pencil to the beat of an unheard song. 
MARTIN 
dejected. He puts the scope away and gets in his car. 
INT. 7-11 - NIGHT 
Martin walks into the store, looking around once again at his old home. To the left of the door, a typical suburban teenage SKATEBOARDER is lost in the "Mortal Combat" video game and something too loud from his walkman. Carl, still working the double, nods to Martin. 
CARL Can I help you? 
MARTIN What's done is done. 
Martin moves up one aisle to the gum rack. He picks out a pack of Beaman's and unwraps a stick as he heads to the counter. On the way, he makes a black Town Car pulling into a spot next to his own. He immediately changes course, and bee-lines for a rear aisle where he ducks down...

Reacting to barton's look as he washes his hands. This time, a curt nod accompanies his pleasant smile. 
BARTON 
Looks back down, then up again. 
THE MAN 
Extends a dripping hand. 
MAN Bill Mayhew. Sorry about the odor. 
His speech is softly accented, from the South. 
BARTON Barton Fink. 
They shake, then return to their ablutions. 
We hold on Barton as we hear Mayhew's faucet being turned off and his foot-steps receding. For some reason, Barton's eyes are widening. 
BARTON ...Jesus. W.P.! 
The dapper little man stops and turns. 
MAYHEW I beg your pardon? 
BARTON W.P. Mayhew? The writer? 
MAYHEW Just Bill, please. 
Barton stands with his back to the sink, facing the little man, his hands dripping onto the floor. There is a short pause. Barton is strangely agitated, his voice halting but urgent. 
BARTON Bill!... 
Mayhew cocks his head with a politely patient smile. Finally Barton brings out: 
BARTON ...You're the finest novelist of our time. 
Mayhew leans against a stall. 
MAYHEW Why thank you, son, how kind. Bein' occupied here in the worship of Mammon, I haven't had the chance yet to see your play  
He smiles at Barton's surprise. 
MAYHEW ...Yes, Mistuh Fink, some of the news reaches us in Hollywood. 
He is taking out a flask and unscrewing its lid. 
BARTON Sir, I'm flattered that you even recognize my name. My God, I had no idea you were in Hollywood. 
MAYHEW All of us undomesticated writers eventually make their way out here to the Great Salt Lick. Mebbe that's why I allus have such a powerful thrust. 
He clears his throat, takes a swig from the flask, and waves it at Barton. 
MAYHEW ...A little social lubricant, Mistuh Fink? 
BARTON It's still a little early for me. 
MAYHEW So be it. 
He knocks back some more. 
BARTON ...Bill, if I'm imposing you should say so, I know you're very busy  I just, uh... I just wonder if I could ask you a favor... That is to say, uh... have you ever written a wrestling picture? 
Mayhew eyes him appraisingly, and at length clears his throat. 
MAYHEW ...You are drippin', suh. 
Barton looks down at his hands, then pulls a rough brown paper towel from a dispenser. 
Mayhew sighs: 
MAYHEW ...Mistuh Fink, they have not invented a genre of picture that Bill Mayhew has not, at one time or othuh, been invited to essay. I have taken my stabs at the wrastlin' form, as I have stabbed at so many others, and with as little success. I gather that you are a fresh-man here, eager for an upperclassman's council. However, just at the moment... 
He waves his flask. 
MAYHEW ...I have drinkin' to do. Why don't you stop at my bungalow, which is numbah fifteen, later on this afternoon... 
He turns to leave. 
MAYHEW ...and we will discuss wrastlin' scenarios and other things lit'rary. 
THE NUMBER "15" 
We are close on brass numerals tacked up on a white door. 
Muted, from inside, we hear Mayhew's voice  enraged, bellowing.  We hear things breaking. Softer, we hear a woman's voice, its tone placating. 
REVERSE TRACKING SLOWLY IN 
On Barton, standing in front of the door. 
The noise abates for a moment. We hear the woman's voice again.

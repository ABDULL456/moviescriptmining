WHITE 3-14-12 13. 
SMITH Yes, a sentimental one. I'm from Detroit. He was the Tiger shortstop when I was a boy. How about you? Who's your best? 
RICKEY Pop Lloyd. 
SMITH Not Honus Wagner? 
RICKEY Wagner is number two. And Rabbit Tavener would not break my top 25. Where do you suppose Jackie Robinson will end up on that list? 
SMITH He won't break it. He doesn't have a shortstop's arm. Robinson belongs on second base. 
RICKEY Alright then, where would he rate at second? 
SMITH If he was playing now he'd be the best second baseman in the majors. 
RICKEY High praise. He'll have to be the best in the minor leagues first. 
SMITH What are you saying, Mr. Rickey? 
RICKEY I'm saying it's going to be a very interesting spring training. A lot of players are coming back from the war and with gas rationing over, we can train down in Florida again. 
SMITH Daytona Beach? 
(RICKEY NODS) You're aware in the past six months a black boy was lynched in Madison, Florida and a black man down in Live Oaks? 
RICKEY Those towns may as well be a million miles from Daytona. 
WHITE 3-14-12 14. 
SMITH Live Oaks is 150 actually. 
RICKEY I spoke to the Daytona mayor. He assures me there'll be no trouble. But Rickey doesn't sound so sure. They consider each other. 
RICKEY (CONT'D) Mr. Smith, are you a Communist? 
SMITH I'm a Democrat. Why do you ask? 
RICKEY I have a business proposition. What's your salary at the Courier? 
SMITH Fifty dollars a week. 
RICKEY I will pay you an additional fifty dollars a week plus expenses if you will attend spring training with Jackie Robinson. You will watch over him, help him to avoid the harm that could come if he were to do or say anything out of turn. You will act as his chauffeur, you will secure accommodations for him wherever the team may be, help him find restaurants, etc... 
SMITH What's in it for me? Besides the fifty dollars and a whole lot of aggravation? 
RICKEY Unprecedented access for any reportage you feel appropriate. What do you say, Mr. Smith? 
SMITH I say yes, sir. If a Negro is good enough to stop a Nazi bullet in France; he's good enough to stop a line drive at Yankee Stadium. 
RICKEY Ebbets Field actually, but yes, I agree. The world is ready.

14 INT. BALLROOM - THE WALDORF ASTORIA HOTEL - NIGHT 14 
Over 500 guests: journalists, players and politicians all listen politely as a SPEECH drones to an end. INSERT: New York City. 23rd Annual Baseball Writer's Association Dinner February 3, 1946. 
SPEAKER As our former President Herbert Hoover remarked in his tribute to our national pastime: âThe rigid voluntary rules of right and wrong, as applied in baseball, are second only to religion in strengthening the morals of the American people.' Polite applause as the speaker steps off. The clapping more enthusiastic as the lights dim on all but an impromptu set: plantation house columns. Hoots as a BUTLER appears wearing satin knee breeches and a MONTREAL ROYALS jersey. He holds a ring like a lawn jockey, a WHITE MAN in BLACK FACE. The laughs get louder as he peers out with exaggerated wide eyes. 
BUTLER Lordy, lordy, it's looking like da massa will be late dis ebning. As the LAUGHS from the audience subside, a sportswriter dressed as a COLONEL enters from stage right. 
COLONEL Robbie! Robbie! 
BUTLER Yassuh, Massa Kunl. Here Ah is. Huge LAUGHS as he struts and dances his way over. 
WHITE 3-14-12 16. 
COLONEL Jackie, you woolly headed rascal. How long yo' been in the family? 
BUTLER Ebber since Massa Rickey done bots me from da Kansas City Monarchs. 
COLONEL (aside to audience) Rickey that no good carpetbagger! What could he be thinking! Huge LAUGHS from that one. Two people enjoying it we'll recognize later as HERB PENNOCK and BOB COOKE. 
BUTLER Ah came near bein' killed last night, Kunl. 
COLONEL How's that, Jackie boy? 
BUTLER Ah was comin' up a dark street and three men was behind me. And they tried to do me with a baseball bat. 
COLONEL You don't say? 
BUTLER Yes, suh. Ah recognized one of dem. Ah'm gonna hab him arrested.

INT. UNDERGROUND HEADQUARTERS - HALLWAY - MORNING 
We see the FEET of AGENT POLK sprinting down the hallway. 
INT. ULTIMATE INFORMATION ROOM - MORNING 
Agent Polk looks around, spots Gibbons. He rushes to him, waving a COMMUNIQUÉ. 
Gibbons grabs the communiqué, reads it. He looks up, stunned. 
INT. DIRTY APARTMENT - DAY 
Xander is having coffee at his window when his communicator RINGS. 
XANDER (into phone) I guess you got my E-mail. I set up a purchase. Ten cars. 
INTERCUT WITH GIBBONS IN INFORMATION ROOM 
GIBBONS If you're trying to push my buttons, you're on the right track. Don't make me question my own judgment, X. 
XANDER Buddy, you sent me here to get close to their organization, that costs money. 
GIBBONS One point two million dollars? I did not authorize you to spend one point two million dollars! 
XANDER I'm already on a first name basis with these dudes, I got a deal set up, you want me to hammer it or not? 
GIBBONS We're not after car thieves here. 
XANDER What the hell am I after? You're telling me dick. 
GIBBONS That information is classified. You're there to gather information on their operations, period. 
XANDER Call me crazy, but I thought hooking up a million dollar deal was a great way to get on their good side. What else? You gonna hassle me about the weapons and spy stuff too? 
GIBBONS My friend, if you're planning on crossing me... 
XANDER I know, poison needles in my shins. You've got 36 hours. Peace, out. 
Xander hangs up. 
INT. SAM TANNICK'S OFFICE - DAY 
Gibbons stands before Sam's desk. Sam scans over the communiqué. 
SAM TANNICK Ridiculous. Cut him off. I'm sorry Gibbons, you pulled up a shark this time. 
GIBBONS I think we should send him whatever he wants. 
SAM TANNICK You what? A wire transfer of this size? 
GIBBONS If it means getting Silent Night back, absolutely. 
SAM TANNICK You're talking about a very expensive risk here. 
GIBBONS He's gotten closer in 24 hours than all of the other operatives combined. He got us an account number to boot. Now even if he's just dumb and lucky, I say we back his play. (beat) I put him out there, Sam. If he doesn't come up with the money, they'll kill him. I can't let that happen. 
SAM TANNICK Why not? You were going to throw him in a tub full of acid, weren't you? 
Gibbons smiles. 
SAM TANNICK Alright, do what you want. But keep the screws on him. He's a wild card. That could be either good or bad. 
GIBBONS So the odds are up to fifty-fifty? I can deal with that. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. CZECH POLICE BUILDING - ROOFTOP - DAY 
A HELICOPTER comes flying in, a MAN standing out on the strut. He's a disgruntled GADGET WRANGLER from the NSA. His name is TOBY LEE SHAVERS. 
Slovo and Xander watch from a distance as a series of METAL CASES is unloaded by CZECH COPS. Slovo lets out a low whistle. 
SLOVO Your government must know something we don't. 
Shavers walks up to them. 
SHAVERS Hate those Russkie choppers. Rattle- trap pieces of garbage. I'm agent Shavers. Toby Lee Shavers. I'm looking for what's his name. Three X' s. 
XANDER That's would be me. 
Shavers gives him a disapproving look. 
SHAVERS Figures. You got someplace we can spread out my gear or what? I mean today. 
Slovo gestures towards the stairs and Shavers marches off, muttering to himself. 
SLOVO I'll leave you two alone to talk.

BURCH Yeah, well. He may have to be a little more than On the Team... (pause. After considering) I've been speaking to the father. (pause) 
Burch walks a few steps away. Thinking. Scott looks at Anton, questioning. 
BURCH (pause) What about if we had to go "off the meter"? 
SCOTT ...With the Mission, sir. 
Burch thinks for a moment. And then draws Scott aside. Burch glances over at the television, spewing information about Laura Newton, and shakes his head with disgust. 
BURCH (to himself) ...I'm out of time... 
He turns back to Scott. And gestures him into a small room, and closes the door. 
BURCH ...man to man. 
SCOTT The door's closed, Sir. 
BURCH I. Need. To Ask You. To do something. (he is hard-pressed to continue) 
SCOTT I am here to get the girl back. 
Burch thinks a moment, he rubs his face, and shakes his head, and looks up as if to say "This is all we have, this is the best we have". Pause. He nods, as they do not move. 
Burch takes out a photo of a bearded middle-eastern looking man in a business suit, and another, in a mugshot marked "Lewisberg Federal Penitentiary". 
BURCH This man...Placed a phonecall. Yesterday. From the phonebank at Lewisberg. To the Copley Payphone. (pause) Here's the cut-off-point... (he looks meaningfully at Scott. Pause) ...here it is: This man, Eli Assani, is to be transported, tomorrow, Wednesday, with another convict. A Man on Death Row. For their medical procedures...Now: 
EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. DAY. 
A Police Cruiser coming quickly down a two-lane, deserted road. 
ANGLE INT. THE CRUISER. A road sign reads "Just Two Miles To 'The Owl', Rest Stop, Restaurant, Gas-Diesel". 
ANGLE EXT. THE OWL. Rest Stop. A run-down rural gas station, restaurant. Off to the side we see the cruiser coming down the road. As a roughly-dressed man runs out of the restaurant, carrying a full paper bag in his hand. The Cruiser, unseen by the man, pulls up to the gas pump, and the Trooper starts to get out of the driver's seat. When gunfire erupts from the restaurant. People are shooting at the fleeing man. A man opens the door of the restaurant and fires at the roughly-dressed man in a very urban leather jacket, who returns fire. Glass breaks in the windows of the restaurant. 
The roughly-dressed man runs to his car, an 80's Pontiac, parked near the pumps. The man in the doorway fires again, and the windshield of the Pontiac blows out and a tire bursts. The roughly-dressed man returns fire, and the man in the doorway falls. The roughly-dressed man turns to see that the Trooper is out of his Cruiser, and is about to fire at him. The roughly-dressed man drops his satchel, and fires at the Trooper, who falls. 
The paper bag has fallen to the ground and burst, and currency is spilling out of it, and being taken on the wind. The roughly-dressed man frantically begins to try to scoop it up and into his jacket. 
ANGLE CU on this man, who we now see is SCOTT. He stands around, and moves to the fallen Trooper. He strips the keys from the Trooper's keyring, and looks up. Feeling someone gazing at him. 
ANGLE HIS POV. In the car, two convicts, a Heavyset Man and ELI ASSANI, the middle-eastern man we saw in the mugshot. He is holding his neck, which is bleeding copiously. 
We see the back window behind him, shattered by gunfire. 
ANGLE on Scott, who gets into the car, takes the keys he took from the Trooper, and begins screaming off down the highway. 
LOW ANGLE, showing the car taking a turn vastly too fast, the car careens up on two wheels, rights itself, fishtails, corrects, and disappears in the distance. 
ANGLE INT. THE CAR. Scott driving steals a look back at Assani, in the back seat, whimpering. 
SCOTT Shut up. 
The Police Radio chatters: "Two Twelve Sierra, come back...Two Twelve Sierra, come back, we have your request for Code Seven...please come back with your Twenty." 
HEAVYSET CONVICT Yeah, two twelve sierra took all the 20 he's gonna take...Oh, man, you left him there... 
ANGLE on Scott driving. He looks behind him. 
ANGLE, POV. In the rearview mirror. A dust cloud settling over the deserted highway. 
ANGLE INT. THE OWL. Various techies, in the kitchen, monitoring the broadcast of the microphone in the Police Car, Anton among them. The Trooper comes in, taking off his bullet-proof vest, and sits to listen, where we find Miller and his Agents. The 'Restaurant Owner', who we now see is Anton, takes off his jacket and his bullet-proof vest and picks a slug, fired by Scott, out of the center of the vest. 
HEAVYSET CONVICT (V.O.) ...yeah. You marked him Paid in Full... 
ASSANI (V.O.) ...you got to pull over, you got to stop...I'm bleeding. 
ANGLE INT. THE POLICE CAR. 
HEAVYSET CONVICT Yeah, he done ate from the tree of knowledge, our Sierra Two Twelve. 
ASSANI ...help me... 
SCOTT Shut up. 
ANGLE, EXT. COUNTRY ROAD. The car comes to a panic stop, fifty yards beyond a turnoff onto a dirt road. The car is put in gear, backs up, and takes the road. 
EXT. FARM ROAD. DAY. 
The car comes quickly up a small farm road, we see a run- down barn, and a farmhouse, washing on the line. Scott pulls the car into the barn, next to an old pick-up truck. He gets out of the car, we hear Assani in the backseat calling to him.

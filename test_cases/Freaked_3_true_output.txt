EXT. THE LAB - NIGHT 
The barn looks especially sinister silhouetted against a big green moon. A huge ball of flame belches out of the smoke stack. 
RICK (O.S.) AAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHRRRRGGGGGGG! 
DISSOLVE TO: 
EXT. THE LAB - MORNING 
It's eerily quiet in the dawn light. 
INT. LAB 
Extreme close-up of Rick's eye as it opens, and searches the room frantically. Close-up of Rick's hand--a normal hand-- straining at the bonds. 
RICK's POV groggily searches the lab, and picks up the blurred image of Elijah in the distance. He's on the phone, speaking in hushed tones. 
ELIJAH This is Red Swan. May I speak to the Laughing Man?... Yes, I'll hold. 
For a moment, Elijah is entertained by hold music to the tune of "Freak Out," by Chic. A man's laughing voice comes on the other end of the line. It laughs throughout the "conversation". 
ELIJAH Laughing Man? Red Swan. I've done it! I found the perfect subject-- huge ego, shallow personality, almost no moral values... A lawyer? No, better. An actor. Yeah, the guy from those hilarious "Hey Dude" movies! Hahahaha-- 
Laughing man has stopped laughing. Elijah dummies up. 
ELIJAH (SHEEPISHLY) Well, I liked 'em. 
Laughing man resumes laughing. Elijah listens intently. 
ELIJAH (CONT'D) Right... Yes... Yes, I see... But that's just it. He's not quite, uh, finished. I need more Noxon so I can-- 
Laughing Man laughs so loudly Elijah has to hold the phone away. 
ELIJAH (ASIDE) Geez, what a grouch. 
Over on the slab, Rick groans. He's waking up. Elijah notices. 
ELIJAH (to Laughing man) Laughing Man? I have to go. What about the Noxon? Two days? Great, you can see everything then... Yeah, you take it easy too. 
Elijah hangs up the phone, and strides over towards Rick. 
ELIJAH Wakey, wakey. Time to meet and greet the new you. 
RICK Huh? 
He flips the slab right-side up, and holds up a mirror. Rick's eyes widen in terror as he beholds his hideous new form. Rick's left half has been transformed into a hideous, bug-eyed monster! 
RICK AAaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaargh! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. LAB - MORNING 
BANG! The doors fly open. Elijah drags Rick out. Horrified, Rick clutches the monster side of his face. 
RICK Oh God! This was my good side! 
ELIJAH Still is if you ask me! Hell, even half-done, you'll be the star of the show tonight. 
Elijah stops in front of the tiny outhouse. 
ELIJAH (CONT'D) Welcome to your spacious accommodations. 
He unlocks the door and drags Rick in. 
INT. OUTHOUSE 
Oddly, the interior is a vast barracks, fifty feet long and thirty feet high. Rick looks around. 
RICK (IMPRESSED) Great use of the space. 
ELIJAH I learned it all from Bob Vila.

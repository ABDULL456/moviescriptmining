TIGHT ON THE FACE OF A MAN -- Rabbi Levartov -- the hinge- maker 
Goeth tried to kill with a faulty revolver -- 
THE KEYS HAMMER another name -- PERLMAN -- 
TIGHT ON TWO ELDERLY FACES -- a man, a woman -- the parents of "Elsa Krause." IN HIS SMALL CLUTTERED PLASZOW OFFICE -- Stern transcribes D.E.F.workers' names from a Reich Labor Office document to the list in his typewriter, Schindler's List. 
NAME -- A FACE -- NAME -- FACE -- NAME -- 
TIGHT ON SCHINDLER slowly pacing the six or seven steps Stern's cramped office allows, nursing a drink. 
SCHINDLER Poldek Pfefferberg... Mila Pfefferberg... 
THE KEYS typing PFEFFE- PFEFFERBERG'S face, tight. MILA'S face, tight. 
CURRENCY, hard Reichmarks, in a small valise. As Goeth looks at it, he mumbles to himself -- 
GOETH A virus... 
MOVING DOWN THE LIST of names, forty, fifty. The sound of the keys. Stern pulls the sheet out of the machine, rolls in another, types a name. 
EQUIPMENT BEING LOADED onto trucks outside Madritsch's Plaszow factory. 
SCHINDLER You can do the same thing I'm doing. There's nothing stopping you. 
Madritsch is shaking his head no' to Schindler's appeal to make his own list, to get his workers out. 
MADRITSCH I've done enough for the Jews. 
THE KEYS typing another name -- A FACE, a man, A FACE, a woman, A FACE, a child -- 
COGNAC SPILLING into a glass. The glass coming up to Schindler's mouth, hesitating there. 
SCHINDLER The investors. 
A NAME -- A FACE -- one of the original D.E.F. investors. 
ANOTHER NAME -- ANOTHER FACE -- another of the Jewish investors. 
SCHINDLER All of them. Szerwitz, his family. 
STERN GLANCES UP with a look that asks Schindler if he's sure about this one. He is. The keys type SZERWITZ -- 
TIGHT ON THE FACE of the investor who stole from Schindler, the one he threatened to have killed by the SS, and the faces of his sons -- 
THREE OR FOUR PAGES of names next to the typewriter. Stern, trying to count them, estimates -- 
STERN Four hundred, four fifty -- 
SCHINDLER More. 
THE TRUNK OF SCHINDLER'S MERCEDES yawning open. He takes a small valise from it and heads for Goeth's villa. 
THE KEYS typing ROSNER -- 
TIGHT ON Henry Rosner, the violinist. TIGHT ON his brother, Leo, the accordionist. 
SCHINDLER AND BOSCH, the other Plaszow industrialist. The same appeal Schindler made to Madritsch; the same answer, no.' 
MOVING DOWN another page of names. 
STERN (O.S.) About six hundred -- 
SCHINDLER (O.S.) More. 
THE SOUND OF THE KEYS OVER the face of a boy, the "chicken thief." Over THE FACE OF A GIRL, the one who hid in the pit of excrement. Over the FACES we've never seen. 
STERN (O.S.) Eight hundred, give or take. 
SCHINDLER (angrily) Give or take what, Stern -- how many -- count them. 
STERN RUNS HIS FINGER down the pages of names, trying to count them more precisely. 
BLACKJACK, dealt by GOETH. They're betting diamonds, he and Schindler. A queen falls and Goeth groans his misfortune. 
THE FACE OF Goeth's maid. 
GOETH SWEEPS his hold card against the table, is thrown a four, sweeps it again and gets a jack. 
A NAME we don't recognize is typed. 
A FACE we don't recognize. 
INT. STERN'S OFFICE - PLASZOW - NIGHT 
Schindler leafing through the page of names, counting them, drinking, to the sound of the typewriter. Eventually, quietly to himself -- 
SCHINDLER That's it. 
Stern heard him and stops typing, glances over.

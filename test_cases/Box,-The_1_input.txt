ARTHUR I'm not gonna touch you, lady. 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- PERIODICALS SECTION -- NEXT 
Arlington now stares directly into Norma's soul. The scar tissue on the left side of his face does not move when he smiles. It remains frozen... unable to express emotion. 
ARLINGTON And what emotion did you feel when you first laid eyes upon me, Norma? She thinks silently for a moment. 
NORMA I felt.. . She stops herself... afraid of how he might respond if she is honest with him. 
ARLINGTON You felt what? 
NORMA I felt... 
ARLINGTON Pity? 
NORMA Love. 
ARLINGTON You felt love for me? 
NORMA Yes. 
ARLINGTON Why? 
NORMA Because of my foot. Because of my disfigurement. I thought of all the pain I've felt in my life because of it... the physical pain... the emotional pain. 
(BEAT) 
(MORE) 
NORMA (CONT'D) I thought about what it would be like to have that pain magnified and projected onto my face... onto a part of my body that I can't hide with a shoe. There are tears welling in her eyes. 
NORMA (CONT`D) I saw all of that pain in your face and I understood it... and I felt an overwhelming feeling of love for you because I knew I'd never feel sorry for myself or my goddamn foot ever again. 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- RECORDS ROOM -- NEXT 
Elizabeth continues to hold her hand out toward Arthur. 
ELIZABETH Take my hand, son. 
ARTHUR You called me a cuckold. You made a statement... made an implication to me that my wife was going to be killed. 
(BEAT) So please understand why I might be reluctant to take your hand. 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- PERIODICALS SECTION -- NEXT 
Arlington reaches his hand out to Norma. 
ARLINGTON Take my hand, Norma... She stares at him, unable to move... then takes his hand... 
INT. RICHMOND PUBLIC LIBRARY -- RECORDS ROOM -- NEXT 
Elizabeth reaches out and grabs Arthur's hand against his will. His body convulses at her touch... The CAMERA drifts in toward Arthur's face as his eyes slowly close. Her spell has been cast upon him... 
CUT TO BLACK: 
SILENCE. 
INT. DREAM -- CORRIDOR -- NEXT 
The CAMERA moves slowly down a CORRIDOR. The floor is shiny white marble and the walls are framed by ornate molding and 
RENAISSANCE ART. Arlington stands at the end of the corridor. He is wearing a TUXEDO, portraying the VALET character from Sartre's No Exit. The CAMERA pans around to reveal Arthur... walking slowly down the corridor. Arlington opens a DOOR at the end of the corridor and leads Arthur into a DRAWING ROOM... recreated from Sartre's play. 
INT. DREAM -- DRAWING ROOM -- NEXT 
Arlington leads Arthur inside and closes the door behind him. Inside the DRAWING ROOM, there are THREE COUCHES made in the style.: of the SECOND EMPIRE. The walls are covered in similar Renaissance art and the floor is marble. NORMA and WALTER have now been admitted to the drawing room. Norma is dressed in an elegant BLACK GOWN. Walter wears a tuxedo that looks to be nearly identical to the one his father is wearing... and THERE IS A SILK BLINDFOLD WRAPPED AROUND HIS HEAD. He wanders around the room... lost... The dimensions of the room are equal in every way. It is a perfect three-dimensional box. Arthur then looks to his wife. He notices that her EYELIDS are now gone. Arthur then turns to his son. Walter reaches out into the air... seemingly unaware that they are in, the room with him. The CAMERA moves through the wall into another corridor... BUD WALL... dressed as another VALET, passes by... and the CAMERA moves into another DRAWING ROOM...

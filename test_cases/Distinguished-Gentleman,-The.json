Debbie rushes over to her. DEBBIE What's the matter? LORETTA (hyperventilating) My --   my ring. My diamond. I took it off   in the ladies' room to wash my hands.    I was just putting it on -- I must   have dropped it. \nDEBBIE (getting down) Let me help you, we'll find it. LORETTA Call Security! 9   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM Tommy maintains his watch on          9 Loretta. Zeke Bridges taps Tommy on the shoulder. ZEKE Hey, what about our drinks? Tommy instantly assumes an ANGRY YOUNG STREET BLACK VOICE: TOMMY Yeah?    What you want? ZEKE What?    You already took our order. \nTOMMY That wasn't me! You must be thinking of Jamal. I'm Karim. What you want? ZEKE Bourbon straight up and a Perrier rocks. TOMMY (snorts derisively) Hunh. He walks two steps...and once again makes no attempt to get the drinks. Zeke returns to Jeff Johnson.

Pyramid Insurance doesn't want special breaks. I just think we ought to be able to set our own rates without Uncle Sam sticking his nose in our business. Johnson signals Jennifer to come over. JOHNSON Do you know my AA? Zeke Bridges, this is Jennifer, my Administrative Assistant. Zeke's been a tremendous help to us. I'd like you to listen to his view on health insurance. JENNIFER I'd be very happy to. ZEKE At Pyramid Insurance, we call our approach the Patient's Bill of Rights. 10   IN THE HALLWAY Loretta and Debbie are on hands and      10 knees, still looking. A pair of shoes comes INTO FRAME. They LOOK up at a bullet-headed man. BRUNO Ms. Preston?   Bruno Handler, hotel security. LORETTA My ring!   My ring! Oh my god...! \nBRUNO Now just calm down, Ma'am... can you describe the ring? LORETTA It's a diamond ring! A big diamond ring! Oh my Christ! She's frantic.   Debbie takes Bruno aside. DEBBIE I saw it. It's huge... it must be like eight carats. She says it was a quarter of a million dollars! Bruno turns back to Loretta, trying to calm her.

LORETTA Of course it's insured! But you know how it works -- if I report it, they'll cancel me. And I don't want another ring! I need this ring! The ring Carlos gave me. Bruno turns, speaks into the walkie-talkie he's carrying. BRUNO Where the fuck is housekeeping? I called for those dickheads ninety seconds ago. 11   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM the Guests have gathered to hear      11 Johnson speak. As Andersen introduces him, Tommy con- tinues eyeing Loretta. ANDERSEN Now I won't run through Jeff's record -- he's been in Congress twenty years, and I've only got two minutes. I'll just say this: When those of us in pharmaceuticals, or agribusiness, or insurance, or (indicating himself) utilities, or you name it -- when we've needed him, Jeff's been there for us. And we've been there for Jeff, too -- we raised a hundred thousand dollars today! (APPLAUSE) Without further ado, our man in Washington, Jefferson Davis Johnson. 12   IN THE HALLWAY Debbie hears the APPLAUSE (O.S.).   She     12 gets up. DEBBIE I should be in there. Good luck, Ms. Preston. I hope you find it. She leaves.   Loretta, mascara smeared, gets up, as does Bruno. LORETTA I can't go in there like this. God! Please... listen... I'll pay a ten thousand dollar reward for anybody who finds my ring. Just don't tell Carlos! (suddenly grim) He'll kill me. \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            9. 13   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM, as Johnson takes questions, Tommy    13 slips out. QUESTIONER What do you make of all this campaign reform business, Jeff? JOHNSON Well, y'know Ernie... these days, everyone's down on the political action committees and so-called special interests. But, heck, I think you and Fran have a right to participate in our democracy in exactly the way you're doing today. I'm in Congress to represent you. I don't want any so-called reform to take that power away from you. 14   APPLAUSE (O.S.). IN THE HALLWAY Bruno issues orders to     14 two Maintenance Men. BRUNO I want every heating grate opened and inspected. I want every air conditioning duct vacuumed. Do you understand what I'm saying? AS he speaks, Bruno SEES Tommy pass through the hallway ... spot something on the floor... pick it up... furtive- ly put it in his pocket... and walk rapidly toward the door to the kitchens.

Now a valuable diamond ring is mising... TOMMY Valuable? We can almost see the light bulb click on above Bruno's head. BRUNO Very valuable. All right, I'll give you a hunnert bucks for it. TOMMY A hundred and five? Bruno snorts agreement, goes for his wallet... Tommy goes gor the ring... then suddenly leaps back in a cringe! TOMMY No! It's a trick! You will call me a thief and send me back and the Security Police will make me stand on my head in the guano pit! I have seen such things on CNN! Bruno snaps and GRABS TOMMY BY THE COLLAR. BRUNO Jesus, I'm not trying to trick you... TOMMY No, no... it is a trap! I must turn this over to police. He starts to leave.   Bruno grabs him.

So you'd better fork over... TOMMY How big is this... reward? Another lightbulb. BRUNO Um, five hundred dollars. TOMMY You said 'thousands.' BRUNO Yeah.     Right.    A thousand dollars. TOMMY No, no, no...you said thousands. With an 'S'. This is plural. This means \"two or more thousands.\" BRUNO (deep sigh) Okay, you win. Two thousand. TOMMY Or more.     Two or more. Bruno's had enough -- his grip tightens around Tommy's neck. TOMMY Just making a point. 15   IN HOTEL LOBBY AT THE CASHIER'S DESK Bruno slides a          15 check to the Cashier, who counts a stack of bills. Bruno picks up a house phone, dials. 16   INT.

Can I take a message? BRUNO (smiling to himself) No, thanks, I'll call back. ARMANDO hangs up the phone and exits the hotel room. BRUNO crosses to the far side of the lobby, where Tommy waits inconspicuously. He gives him the money. Tommy gives him ring. BRUNO Now get back to work! As Tommy heads back to the function room, Bruno picks up a house phone, dials, listens. He dials again, listens. No answer. He dials the operator. BRUNO This is Bruno in Security. Put me through to 502 -- there must be something wrong with the line, I can't get an answer... What do you mean, there's no one in 502? I just spoke to them!... No one's registered in 502? Are you sure?... Well, check again!... Shit! He hangs up, looks at the ring, and realizes he's been taken. His face twisting with rage, he hurries after Tommy. 17   ON TOMMY MOVING swiftly through the function room toward 17 an exit. Zeke Bridges grabs him. \nZEKE Hey!   Where the hell are our drinks. Surprised, Tommy opts for an EAST INDIAN ACCENT. TOMMY I remember... you were the sloe gin fizz and the mango daquiri? With perhaps a small umbrella for the lady? ZEKE Bourbon neat and a Perrier, dammit! TOMMY And would you still be wanting the umbrella then?

But from another direction, Johnson and Andersen approach, arm in arm, and sit on a bench by the pillar. JOHNSON Olaf, there's something I wanted to sound you out on. As a special friend. \nANDERSEN Shoot. Tommy moves away from the pillar, sees Bruno roaming the terrace, and retreats. JOHNSON I'm thinking of retiring from Congress. Andersen's eyes widen in astonishment. ANDERSEN You're what? JOHNSON I'm thinking maybe I won't run. Maybe I should listen more (indicating his heart) to this. Really appreciate these years. Sail around the world. Climb mountains. Enjoy the finer things of life. ANDERSEN Jeff. Listen to me. You can't retire. Florida needs you. I need you. I need you on rates. I need you on regulations. I need you on those environmental nutcases -- JOHNSON Olaf, if I retire this year, I get to keep all the money left over in my campaign treasury. Comes to a very tidy nest-egg. ANDERSEN How tidy?

TOMMY I like your initiative, Reinhardt, but to tell you the truth, I've never been much of a student. Maybe you can brief my staff sometime. Reinhardt looks Tommy's cronies over.     Not your classic Hill types. TOMMY But thank you, I will take you up on those logistics. Hey! Entourage! What hotel we at? \nThey look at one another, puzzled.

Reinhardt hasn't heard it put quite that way before. Reinhardt gets his courage up. REINHARDT Say, Congressman, you got my resume, didn't you? TOMMY (hasn't a clue) I'm sure I did. REINHARDT There's something I wanted to ask you. I know it's a big step, but -- I'd like you to consider me to be your AA.

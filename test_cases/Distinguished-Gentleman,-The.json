BEGIN TITLES. CAMERA very slowly PULLS   BACK. The sparkling surface turns out to be a lot of   carats. WE SEE the stone, then the ring, then suddenly,   in b.g., something HUGE SWEEPS by. REVEAL a mechanical    claw above the ring, hanging from a crane. The ring    sits in a sea of tiny dolls, joke eyeballs, and other   carnival junk. The claw descends on the ring again and again, sometimes catching it for a moment then tragically dropping it -- accompanied by OOHS and AAHS (O.S.) of hope and disap- pointment. INTERCUT with the HANDS of a young black man working the controls. The EYES of a young black woman watching him work. Another guy's HANDS digging in his pocket for change. QUARTERS going into the slot. MAN'S VOICE (O.S.) This'll never work, Tommy. TOMMY (O.S.) Be positive, Armando. Course it will. The claw inadvertently snags a rabbit's foot. TOMMY (O.S.) Look.   See what a lucky fuck I am? WOMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) He don't mean the ring, hon, he means the whole plan. \nTOMMY (O.S.) So do I. The claw catches the   ring and closes on it. QUICK CUTS of their FACES as the   crane rises. A very pretty lady. A beefy Latino with a   two-day beard. Their apprehension. Tommy's confidence.    Then his exceptional smile. He gets the ring. 2   INT. PENNY ARCADE - DAY                                     2 TOMMY Okay -- one down, one to go. (returning to the claw) You got quarters, Loretta? END TITLES. \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              2. 3   EXT. FLORIDA LUXURY HOTEL - DAY                             3 Palm trees. The smell of money. Valets in Foreign Legion khakis greeting arriving luxury cars. 4   INT. HOTEL FUNCTION ROOM - DAY                              4 A big crowd of GUESTS at a cocktail reception. A lot of lime jackets, cherry trousers, and blue hair. People wear name tags. ON Tommy, in pastel bow tie and full waiter drag, con- firming orders for a group of guests. He speaks in a PRISSY, OVER-SOLICITIOUS VOICE: TOMMY That's a diet ginger ale, an extra- spicy virgin mary no salt, a club soda -- good choice -- a lime rickey, and a bourbon and a planter's punch. Five people, five drinks... it's Kismet! Tommy turns away, looking toward the entrance to the room. 5   INT. LOBBY - DAY - CLOSE SHOT - THE RING                    5 glittering on Loretta's finger. LORETTA, stunning in designer clothing and accessories, enters. Her looks attract looks. 6   INT. FUNCTION ROOM - DAY                                    6 Tommy, maintaining his vantage point, repeats another order, this time in a heavy CARRIBEAN ACCENT: TOMMY That's a vodka tonic, a Pellegrino, lime and no ice, a gin Gibson straight up with ex-tra onions -- I am also fond of de onions -- and a Chardonnary spritzer...also with extra onions -- no, no, do not worry, that is just a little joke. There will be no onions whatsoever in your spritzer! He LAUGHS HUGELY, rather amused with himself.   The guests aren't. GUEST You don't need to write it down? (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             6. 8   CONTINUED:                                                 8 LORETTA My God!    My God! Oh my God! Debbie rushes over to her. DEBBIE What's the matter? LORETTA (hyperventilating) My --   my ring. My diamond. I took it off   in the ladies' room to wash my hands.    I was just putting it on -- I must   have dropped it. \nDEBBIE (getting down) Let me help you, we'll find it. LORETTA Call Security! 9   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM Tommy maintains his watch on          9 Loretta. Zeke Bridges taps Tommy on the shoulder. ZEKE Hey, what about our drinks? Tommy instantly assumes an ANGRY YOUNG STREET BLACK VOICE: TOMMY Yeah?    What you want? ZEKE What?    You already took our order. \nTOMMY That wasn't me! You must be thinking of Jamal. I'm Karim. What you want? ZEKE Bourbon straight up and a Perrier rocks. TOMMY (snorts derisively) Hunh. He walks two steps...and once again makes no attempt to get the drinks. Zeke returns to Jeff Johnson. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             7. 9    CONTINUED:                                                 9 ZEKE Don't get me wrong, Jeff. Pyramid Insurance doesn't want special breaks. I just think we ought to be able to set our own rates without Uncle Sam sticking his nose in our business. Johnson signals Jennifer to come over. JOHNSON Do you know my AA? Zeke Bridges, this is Jennifer, my Administrative Assistant. Zeke's been a tremendous help to us. I'd like you to listen to his view on health insurance. JENNIFER I'd be very happy to. ZEKE At Pyramid Insurance, we call our approach the Patient's Bill of Rights. 10   IN THE HALLWAY Loretta and Debbie are on hands and      10 knees, still looking. A pair of shoes comes INTO FRAME. They LOOK up at a bullet-headed man. BRUNO Ms. Preston?   Bruno Handler, hotel security. LORETTA My ring!   My ring! Oh my god...! \nBRUNO Now just calm down, Ma'am... can you describe the ring? LORETTA It's a diamond ring! A big diamond ring! Oh my Christ! She's frantic.   Debbie takes Bruno aside. DEBBIE I saw it. It's huge... it must be like eight carats. She says it was a quarter of a million dollars! Bruno turns back to Loretta, trying to calm her. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             8. 10   CONTINUED:                                                 10 BRUNO Ma'am... calm down.   Now, is the ring insured? LORETTA Of course it's insured! But you know how it works -- if I report it, they'll cancel me. And I don't want another ring! I need this ring! The ring Carlos gave me. Bruno turns, speaks into the walkie-talkie he's carrying. BRUNO Where the fuck is housekeeping? I called for those dickheads ninety seconds ago. 11   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM the Guests have gathered to hear      11 Johnson speak. As Andersen introduces him, Tommy con- tinues eyeing Loretta. ANDERSEN Now I won't run through Jeff's record -- he's been in Congress twenty years, and I've only got two minutes. I'll just say this: When those of us in pharmaceuticals, or agribusiness, or insurance, or (indicating himself) utilities, or you name it -- when we've needed him, Jeff's been there for us. And we've been there for Jeff, too -- we raised a hundred thousand dollars today! (APPLAUSE) Without further ado, our man in Washington, Jefferson Davis Johnson. 12   IN THE HALLWAY Debbie hears the APPLAUSE (O.S.).   She     12 gets up. DEBBIE I should be in there. Good luck, Ms. Preston. I hope you find it. She leaves.   Loretta, mascara smeared, gets up, as does Bruno. LORETTA I can't go in there like this. God! Please... listen... I'll pay a ten thousand dollar reward for anybody who finds my ring. Just don't tell Carlos! (suddenly grim) He'll kill me. \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            9. 13   IN THE FUNCTION ROOM, as Johnson takes questions, Tommy    13 slips out. QUESTIONER What do you make of all this campaign reform business, Jeff? JOHNSON Well, y'know Ernie... these days, everyone's down on the political action committees and so-called special interests. But, heck, I think you and Fran have a right to participate in our democracy in exactly the way you're doing today. I'm in Congress to represent you. I don't want any so-called reform to take that power away from you. 14   APPLAUSE (O.S.). IN THE HALLWAY Bruno issues orders to     14 two Maintenance Men. BRUNO I want every heating grate opened and inspected. I want every air conditioning duct vacuumed. Do you understand what I'm saying? AS he speaks, Bruno SEES Tommy pass through the hallway ... spot something on the floor... pick it up... furtive- ly put it in his pocket... and walk rapidly toward the door to the kitchens. BRUNO (running after him) Hey, you! Waiter! Hold it right there! \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             19. 27   CONTINUED:   (3)                                            27 TOMMY Oh NO! It's my husband Lars. He's home early, I must go before ...you want to talk to Lars too? So you like to talk dirty out of both sides of your mouth. (normal voice) Man, you are one twisted bastard! Laughing, he hangs up. GRANDMA Tommy, please! TOMMY Sorry, grandma, just getting a third minute out of him. He clicks off the phone and slams it back into Loretta's purse. Loretta, meanwhile, has reappeared. LORETTA You hung up on Paul? He's one of my best customers. GRANDMA I can't believe any relative of mine does that for a living. LORETTA C'mon Gramma...it's only my voice. They never actually meet me. GRANDMA So my granddaughter talks dirty for a living and my grandson's a thief. TOMMY What's up, Grandma? Are you embarrassed to show my picture around the pool? GRANDMA Of course I'm not. Look. She goes to her sewing basket and pulls something from it. She unfolds it: a long piece of needlepoint she's been working on. INSERT It spells out Tommy's full name:   Thomas Jefferson Johnson. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             20. 27   CONTINUED:   (4)                                            27 GRANDMA (O.S.) Look what these arthritic hands been doing. BACK TO SCENE GRANDMA Make me proud of you, Tommy. Make me proud of the name you carry. In the silence between them that follows, we HEAR the tv. GENERAL MANAGER I'm Ned Grable, vice president and general manager of WFLA. We think Mrs. Jeff Johnson did the right thing in not running for the congressional seat left vacant by her husband's death. The editorial catches Grandma's attention. GENERAL MANAGER Jeff Johnson's name may still be magic. But it'll take more than the magic of name recognition to solve our region's problems. I'm Ned Grable. GRANDMA Name recognition. Lordy, what a notion. People have to be some boobs just to vote for someone because their name is Johnson. Tommy's eyes widen. GRANDMA I remember once back in Georgia, they even elected a dead man. His name was still on the ballot -- people were just used to voting for him. TOMMY What did you say, Grandma? 28   EXT. BAIT SHACK - DAY                                       28 HOMER, the proprietor of Homer's Pit Stop, wearing fuel- smeared overalls, is dieseling a Customer's boat down by the water. TOMMY (O.S.) Homer!    Get your ass over here! (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               20A. 28   CONTINUED:                                                 28 Up by the racks of junk food and beer, and pails of fish slop, Tommy and Armando await Homer. In b.g., an older black gentleman plays checkers, solo. This is VAN DYKE. ARMANDO What's this about, jefe? TOMMY (calling) Loretta! Get off the damn phone! ARMANDO This better be good. TOMMY (sarcastic mimic) \"This better be good.\" Loretta! ON LORETTA on the pay phone, moaning in Swedish ecstasy. LORETTA Oh, ya, ya, God, you're so big! (waving at Tommy) Uh-oh, I have to go now, my husband Sven is home early... Tommy grabs the phone.   He pushes aside a protesting Loretta... TOMMY Goddammit, Inga, is it that pervert again! Damn! He smacks the receiver with his hand. TOMMY (into receiver) Listen, you little shit -- I just spent eight years in the joint, nobody talks to my woman like that! I got your adress, I got a machete, I got two Rotweilers... I'm gonna come to your house and tear your ass up! (hangs up, laughing) LORETTA Okay, Tommy, what's so damn important? HOMER Yeah, I got work to do. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            21. 28   CONTINUED:   (2)                                           28 They all look at him expectantly. He takes a dramatic pause, then launches into a \"Come to Jesus\" speech. TOMMY My friends, I want to tell you about a town where the streets are paved with gold. This is a town where the marks give you money before you ask. A town where they take you to dinner after you fuck 'em. A town where when they need money, they just print more. This is a town where a guy bounced nine hundred checks and he didn't even have to skip town!!! \nARMANDO Ain't no town like that. LORETTA You mean Vegas? TOMMY No. (beat) Washington, D.C.   I'm going to run for Congress. His big smile meets their blank surprise.   Their faces fall. LORETTA What is this, a joke? HOMER I don't get it. \nARMANDO What's the con, Tommy? TOMMY Van Dyke.   You remember Willie Sutton? VAN DYKE Of blessed memory. TOMMY You remember what he said? They asked him, Why do you rob banks? And he said, That's where the money is. I tell you, people -- Washington. That's where the money is. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            22. 28   CONTINUED:   (3)                                           28 Tommy produces a sheaf of Xeroxes and pamphlets. TOMMY I found this shit in the library. You know how much a congressman makes? A hundred and thirty a year -- and that's just base pay for getting your ass elected. Then there are these things called PACs, and these lobbyists, whose whole point in life is to buy you off. It's the con of a lifetime -- and the damn thing is, it's legal! This is hot, people, we can do this! \nThe widow Johnson is pouring tea for Tommy, now in super- nerd drag -- wire-rim glasses and tweed sport jacket. VERA JOHNSON I'm not sure I understand, Professor Franklin -- you wrote your doctoral thesis on my husband? TOMMY He was a great man, Mrs. Johnson. He did so much for my people. VERA JOHNSON He... did? TOMMY Oh, yes. I'll never forget when he said 'Welfare is a drug -- and you gotta kick it cold turkey.' It was... inspirational. \nVERA JOHNSON Really... well, I'm sure... TOMMY And I was actually in the audience when he said, 'If you people would just get off your dead asses and look for work, this country might be fit to live in again.' Powerful stuff. VERA JOHNSON It's very kind of you to say so. And you're very kind to come all the way from... where was it? (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            27. 31   CONTINUED:                                                 31 TOMMY Wilson-Pickett State Teachers College. But I didn't just come to pay respects, ma'am. I came because your husband deserves an archive. A place where scholars can study his legacy. A storehouse for the record of his remarkable career. VERA JOHNSON I see.   So you want... his papers? TOMMY Oh, not just his papers, Mrs. Johnson. Everything. Buttons, posters, bumper stickers. All the paraphernalia of his campaigns -- proof of his political genius. Now I realize that you may have a sentimental attachment to a few items... VERA JOHNSON Take 'em. TOMMY I beg your pardon. VERA JOHNSON Take 'em all. Would you like the wedding photos, too? TOMMY Well, I don't think that's necess... VERA JOHNSON Good -- that way you won't have to go rooting around in the garbage. Is there anything else? TOMMY Well, um... no. VERA JOHNSON More tea?   Or something stronger? I know it's  only ten-thirty, but, hell, sun's  over the yardarm somewhere,  right? TOMMY Actually, ma'am, I should be getting back. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            28. 31   CONTINUED:   (2)                                           31 VERA JOHNSON You're in pretty good shape for a professor. D'you work out? Tommy rises and packs his briefcase hastily. TOMMY Look, I, um, have a class to teach. You know how blind students are... they're so dependent. (edges toward door) Don't worry ma'am... your materials will be in good hands. \n32   EXT. WHARF - DAY - CLOSE ANGLE - A SCISSORS                32 cuts the RE- off a RE-ELECT JEFF JOHNSON bumper sticker in familiar blue and gold. Van Dyke, Armando, and Homer have a production line going, doctoring the old Johnson campaign materials, slicing off and painting out the RE-'s and the years. VAN DYKE Are you sure you don't want to come to Washington with us, Homer? HOMER You bums got time on your hands. (indicating bait shack) I got a business to run. ON LORETTA working the RINGING pay phone. \nLORETTA Hello? Who? The League of Women Voters? Sorry, Mr. Johnson won't be attending the debate. No -- no, Betty, I'm sorry, I can't tie up this line. (hangs up; it RINGS) Hello? The Sarasota Star-Ledger? I'm sorry, we're out of photographs. No, you can't, Mr. Johnson has just had surgery for a deviated septum. (hangs up; it RINGS) Hello? (brightening) Ya, this is Inga. PAN TO TOMMY training a home video camera on a poster that reads JEFF JOHNSON FOR CONGRESS.

We're not going to show you Jeff Johnson kissing babies. We're not going to show you Jeff Johnson doing anything, because you already know what Jeff Johnson can do. \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            40. 62    CONTINUED:    (2)                                          62 TOMMY Fine, but I'm gonna be real offended if either of you miss my reception. They leave. TOMMY I think we have to have a reception. AT THE BUFFET, as Tommy and Loretta help themselves generously to oysters and champagne, they overhear TWO MEMBERS passing by. \nFIRST MEMBER So then I ran an ad calling him a draft dodger, but then he ran an ad calling me a plagiarist. SECOND MEMBER What did you do? FIRST MEMBER Oh, leaked a rumor that his father- in-law was a Nazi. I went up ten points in a weekend. TOMMY (to Loretta) We're in the majors, doll. 62A   THE BALCONY is full of people working one another. As      62A Tommy and Loretta pass some large stone statues, a man extends his hand -- liquor lobbyist KEN KORNGOLD. \nKORNGOLD Congressman? I'd like to introduce myself. Ken Korngold. National Distilled Spirits Association. TOMMY Tommy Johnson. Distilled Spirits, is that right? KORNGOLD It's super that you won, congressman. Any way we can help, please don't hesitate. TOMMY Pleasure's all mine, Ken, hope you can make it to my reception. Do you happen to have a card? (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             41. 62A   CONTINUED:                                                  62A KORNGOLD (giving him one) I sure do. 63    INT. UNION STATION - MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT                     63 Tommy is along a wall where other guests are similarly occupied. TOMMY You now what I love about this place? The way everyone calls you a Member.  Every time I hear that, it makes me think of Mr. Happy here. \nThe Member next to him bursts out laughing. TOMMY Don't you be peeing on my shoe. They go to the sinks.    The Member introduces himself. IOWA Mike Strangland. Iowa -- first CD. TOMMY You got a CD?    Shit, I missed that, too. IOWA First Congressional district. TOMMY Ohhh. Tommy Johnson. Florida. So Iowa -- how'd you get to Washington? You do the crop report on tv? IOWA has a big open face and a flat Midwestern voice. IOWA No -- I owe it all to the Vietnamese. TOMMY War hero? IOWA P.O.W. When I got back to Cedar Rapids, I spent so many years telling the Rotary Club what was wrong in Washington, they finally told me to put up or shut up -- so I put up. And here I am. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              42. 63   CONTINUED:                                                   63 TOMMY Wait a minute. What's wrong in Washington? IOWA C'mon -- there's acid rain killing fish, and no one's stopping it... there's topsoil washing away, and no erosion program... there's chemicals in our livestock -- God, I sound like a Boy Scout. TOMMY That's alright, Iowa -- this place could use a few geeks like you. \n64   INT.

TOMMY Hey... thank you... nice to see you... hope you can make it to my reception. Have y'all met Miss Loretta? TOMMY'S TABLEMATE is lawyer-lobbyist TOMMY O'CONNOR, 40s. As Waiters serve lobster bisque, he hands TJ a business card. O'CONNOR Tommy O'Connor. Soon as I saw how you got elected, I knew you were a real comer. Hell, I bet old Olaf Andersen voted for you. TOMMY Who's Olaf Andersen? (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            47. 73   INT. KORNGOLD'S OFFICE - DAY                               73 Expensive furniture, rugs, and art. KORNGOLD How are you on this helluva fine day! I'm looking forward to your reception. INTERCUT TOMMY AND KORNGOLD TOMMY Actually, that's why I'm calling, Ken. You said if I needed some help -- KORNGOLD You name it, congressman. Issue papers, testimony, floor speeches -- TOMMY Tell you what I have in mind. I was just thinking, wouldn't it be a plus for old Ken Korngold if I was to -- how should I put this -- showcase some of his distillers' products at my reception? You know, like they put Reese's pieces in E.T.? It's called \"product placement.\" People come in, they have a tremendous time, they see your products, they think well of you -- and they think well of me, too. It's good for both of us, Ken. What do you say? KORNGOLD Well, it's a new one on me, but hey, sure, I think we can help you out.  Say, while I have you on the line, there was one thing... 74   INT. HOUSE CHAMBER - DAY                                   74 The SPEAKER administers the oath of office to the assembled House.

SPEAKER (V.O.) ... and that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter. So help you God? TOMMY (AND MEMBERS) I do. SPEAKER (V.O.) Congratulations. You are now Members of Congress. Sustained APPLAUSE.   Tommy kisses Grandma. INTERCUT Tommy's cronies APPLAUDING. \nON THE FLOOR Tommy dries Grandma's tears with a finger. GRANDMA It's just that -- I'm so happy you straightened out. Tommy smiles ambiguously. As APPLAUSE continues, his eyes roam the room and make contact with Dick Dodge, standing at one of the leadership tables. Tommy winks conspiratorially at him. There's such diabolical glee in it, it even takes Dodge aback. 77   INT. CANNON TOP FLOOR - DAY                                  77 A beautiful black woman, 20s, walks briskly down the busy Cannon corridors. CELIA. There's intelligence in her eyes, and fire.

She looks in. 78   INT. TOMMY'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY                          78 It's packed, mainly with men.  Everyone has drinks and talks noisily. It looks like  a fraternity smoker for lobbyists. MUSIC comes from  a boom box. The bar -- a tablecloth over some desks -- is lavishly stocked. So are the bookcases, which now look like liquor store shelves. ANGLE ON LORETTA, in a cocktail dress and a HELLO MY NAME IS MISS LORETTA badge, staffing a little table, handing Celia a name-tag. INSERT Celia's hands print CELIA KIRBY.    PRO BONO. BACK TO SCENE - ON Tommy and Reinhardt talking with a LOBBYIST. FOURTH LOBBYIST It's an informal breakfast. You give us your views, we give you bacon and eggs, plus a couple of thousand dollar honorarium. (winking) For your favorite charity. Tommy looks at Reinhardt, who explains. REINHARDT The Tommy Johnson Foundation. \nTOMMY (savoring the word) Honorarium. I like that. Loretta appears with a platter of food. LORETTA Herring, gentlemen? FOURTH LOBBYIST Uh, no thanks. LORETTA Really? We've got it in cream sauce and in wine sauce. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            49A. 78   CONTINUED:                                                78 REINHARDT I think I'll pass. Tommy steers her aside and takes a roll of soggy, toothpick-impaled herring. TOMMY What is this?    Where's the cheese? LORETTA The cheese guy didn't return my call. So I called the guy at the American Smoked Fish Institute. She points at the food table. There's nothing but a few boxes of crackers and two huge mounds of herring -- one white, one pink. The centerpiece is a large smoked fish, eyes staring accusingly. TOMMY Oh, that's just wonderful. Sixty heavy hitters drop in, and I'm feeding 'em cat food. He breaks off, as Celia comes into view in the doorway behind. Tommy picks her up on his radar. TOMMY We'll talk about this later. We follow Tommy through the crowd until he reaches Celia. TOMMY Hi   there. Glad you could make it. So   you're... Celia Kirby. That's an   extremely beautiful name. For an   extremely beautiful woman. CELIA Wow! That's smooth. After ten straight hours on my feet making small talk and breathing cheap cigar smoke, that's exactly the kind of line I'm ready to fall for. TOMMY Whoa, slow down. CELIA Sure, sure, forget it. Can you just tell me, which one's Congressman Johnson? (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            51. 81   CONTINUED:   (2)                                           81 DODGE Oh, I wouldn't read too much into that. A few extra retirements, some redistricting -- nothing more than that. It's still business as usual up here. Dodge takes his glasses from his pocket and wipes them. DODGE I live in the real world, Eli. Do you? What's unemployment up to in your district? Eight percent? Eight-five? \nMARSHALL Eight point six. DODGE Power and Enterprise is about to fund a solar demonstration plant, Eli. It could mean a whole lot to a district -- new jobs, new construction -- that interest you? MARSHALL You can't bribe me, Dick. 82   INT. DODGE'S RECEPTION AREA - DAY                          82 Dodge and Marshall enter. DODGE Eli, the people who elected you. They sent you here to help them. Don't you want to? \nMARSHALL Not  if it means supporting your bill. All  you want is the perfect platform to  campaign for Speaker. Dick Dodge. Mr.  Clean. What a joke! DODGE (undeterred) Come on board, Eli. (leaning in) You know -- you can't save the world if you can't save your seat. Tommy enters.   Marshall gives him a once-over and extends a hand. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            52. 82   CONTINUED:                                                 82 MARSHALL We haven't met. Eli Marshall. TOMMY Tommy Johnson. MARSHALL I know. The Florida upset. Well, now that you're here, what are you going to do with it? You gonna feather your own nest, or are you gonna make something of your office? TOMMY I plan to be as good a congressman as all the others. MARSHALL Exactly what does that mean? TOMMY Well, ever since I got back from Nam, I've wanted to do something about the rain forest -- MARSHALL No, do me a favor, don't tell me. I try not to get depressed until the second week of a new session. DODGE (ushering Tommy into his office) Eli, you'll excuse us -- we have a meeting. 83   INT. DODGE'S OFFICE - DAY                                  83 DODGE Johnson, I'm the chairman of a committee up here called Power and Industry. We've got an open seat, and I was wondering if you'd consider filling it. TOMMY Is this good news? (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              53. 83   CONTINUED:                                                   83 DODGE (tongue in cheek) Well, it is a difficult assignment -- look at what we cover: energy, health, telecommunications, environment... the committee is constantly beset by a swarm of special interests. These are powerful people, they've got all the money in the world, and they're not shy about using it. TOMMY So... this is very good news. \nDODGE Most members would give their right nut for it. TOMMY So what do you want from me, Dick? DODGE Congressman... I just want you to smile for the cameras. 84   INT. POWER AND ENTERPRISE COMMITTEE - DAY                    84 The committee members -- all white males, except Tommy -- mill around, awaiting the start of the hearings. As the TV cameras whir, Dodge shakes Tommy's hand warmly. Big smiles and an explosion of flashbulbs. Dodge breaks off and Tommy drifts over to Reinhardt. REINHARDT (indicating dais) So, Congressman, welcome to the honey pot. You should be one happy freshman. TOMMY Yeah? Well, I'm not. I'm suspicious. One thing I've learned is, when somebody gives you something for nothing, the nothing ain't nothing. It's something. What is it? Why me? Reinhardt puts his hand on Tommy's shoulders. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               54. 84   CONTINUED:                                                    84 REINHARDT Congressman, I don't want you to take this the wrong way, but... you're black. And I mean that in the nicest possible way. TOMMY Keep talking. REINHARDT Dodge wants to run for Speaker. And he ain't gonna make it without votes from the black caucus. Suddenly, Dodge reappears.   He throws his arm around Tommy's shoulders. DODGE Tommy, someone I want you to meet... Dodge steers TJ to a preppy-looking man at the witness table -- BARCLAY \"SKEETER\" WARBURTON. DODGE Skeeter, do you know Tommy Johnson? Meet the new member of the committee. Tommy, this is Barclay Warburton. TOMMY Pleased to meet you, Barclay. WARBURTON'S voice is aristocratic, a la George Plimpton. WARBURTON Skeeter. Please. Been called that since boarding school. \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            58. 89   CONTINUED:                                                 89 CELIA (CONT'D) (rising) So, we'll follow up with your staff in the next week or... TOMMY Wait a minute, you just got here. I clean my calendar, and you're out the door. Let's back up, give this stuff the attention it deserves. Car insurance... Ira, what do you pay? IRA Oh, I've got an '85 Plymouth, about six-fifty a year... TOMMY Six-fifty? Highway robbery! A chop shop wouldn't give you more than a hundred forty for a junker like that. (beat) Or so I've heard. (beat) But I'm flying blind here, I need depth. Could Miss Kirby put together a briefing? Maybe schedule a Saturday or two to really dig into the issues? IRA (surprised and pleased) Oh... we'd be delighted. We've got some figures that will amaze you. TOMMY I'm sure you do. CELIA (rising) Well, we won't take up any more... TOMMY Whoa, whoa, hold on, what about child safety? CELIA Well, we're sponsoring a bill imposing safety standards on imported toys... (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               59. 89   CONTINUED:   (2)                                              89 TOMMY Great! About time! I     hate imported toys. What about food    additives? How about we block out   a few evenings, you can take   me through the details. IRA Celia, if that's what the Congressman wants... any problem? CELIA (to him) You want to do this in the evening? \nIRA I'm away for the next two weeks. She gives him a look.    Ira turns to Tommy. IRA So, when can Celia start your briefings? TOMMY Saturday night? IRA Saturday night sounds fine. CELIA Fine. Wednesday morning.      Nine- fifteen. 90   INT. CATACOMBS - NIGHT - CLOSE ANGLE - A SIGN                 90 \nOn a door in the House sub-basement:    MEMBERS ONLY. 91   INT. HOUSE GYM - NIGHT                                        91 The regular evening pickup basketball game. Even among these ruthless players, Tommy's street moves are outstand- ingly down and dirty. His principal accomplice: Elijah Marshall. 92   INT. LOCKER ROOM - HOUSE GYM - NIGHT                          92 A standing poker game among the towel- and robe-clad Members. It's Tommy's shuffle and deal.    He is convincingly awkward. A BULLDOG of a man examines his hand, tosses two cards in. He assembles his new hand. Four fives and an ace. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92               60. 92   CONTINUED:                                                    92 ON Tommy's hand.   A pair of threes. The betting starts, at a couple of chips, and comes round to Tommy. He pushes a stack of chips to the center. TOMMY Let's get serious, fellas. 93   INT. CATACOMBS (OR CORRIDOR) - NIGHT                          93 Tommy, Marshall, and the Bulldog, back in suits, exit the MEMBERS ONLY door and move through the catacombs. MARSHALL I need your help on the ethics bill, Leon. I want you to co- sponsor my amendments. BULLDOG You make a persuasive case, Eli. MARSHALL That wasn't a yes. BULLDOG (courteously ambiguous) I promise to give it the attention it deserves. The Bulldog gives Tommy a friendly squeeze -- BULLDOG Better luck next time, son. -- and leaves them.   Tommy and Marshall continue on. \nMARSHALL He took six hundred dollars off you that last hand, didn't he? TOMMY Yeah, he's taking a real shine to me. MARSHALL If I didn't know better, I'd say you lost to him on purpose. TOMMY Nothing wrong with letting the chairman of the ethics committee roll you once in a while. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           60A. 93   CONTINUED:                                              93 MARSHALL (shaking his head) You fit in real well up here.   Too well. TOMMY So Eli, how come you haven't asked for my help with your amendments? MARSHALL Give it a rest, Tommy. You've got a great jump shot. But everyone knows you're Dick Dodge's boy. TOMMY (bristling) I'm nobody's boy, mister. MARSHALL (weary) Don't waste your outrage on me. I know what you are. TOMMY I'm no different from anyone else. MARSHALL That's not true. Some people here actually try to do something besides save their own ass. TOMMY You know, Eli, I like you, I really do. You remind me of my father. MARSHALL Oh, really?   How so? TOMMY He thought I was scum, too. BELLS begin RINGING and LIGHTS FLASHING on all the clocks and sconces down the corridor. Three RINGS, pause, three RINGS, pause... Marshall does a U-turn. Tommy doesn't follow suit. MARSHALL Aren't you going to vote? TOMMY (indicating clocks) Vote? Is that what that is? We got a pool going in the office on when it'll go off next. \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92          63. 94   CONTINUED:   (2)                                         94 O'CONNOR Good... TOMMY And if I vote against the labels, I get money from the frozen food guys. O'CONNOR Excellent! And don't forget the ranchers, because they get hurt if pepperoni sales go down! TOMMY (laughing in admiration) A pepperoni lobby. I love this town. O'CONNOR So which is it? TOMMY Fuck the cheese people. Thanks to them my office smelled like smelt for a week. O'CONNOR All right.    For. TOMMY So Tommy, tell me -- with all this money on every side, how does anything get done? O'CONNOR It doesn't!    That's the genius of the system! 95   INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY                                95 A briefing in progress. Flip charts, ring binders, Celia, Ira, a couple of other Pro Bono types. Tommy is riveted by Celia. CELIA It comes down to a question of what is acceptable risk. Are we willing to feed our kids a substance that causes cancer in lab rats? More important, who gets to make the decision? Bureaucrats and big corporations, or the people whose lives depend on it? \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            64. 96   INT. TOMMY'S BOILER ROOM - DAY                             96 Tommy's staff shares one small office.   Everyone's on the phone. VAN DYKE Mr. Willie? Congressman Johnson is calling. Can you take his call? Thank you. Please hold. Van Dyke puts him on hold, counts to three, gets back on the line. VAN DYKE I'm sorry, Mr. Willie, he just picked up another call. Listen, I know why he was calling -- he hasn't heard from you about his fundraiser... PAN TO Armando. ARMANDO ... That's right, Mr. Brown, on the thirtieth... A thousand a couple...A whole table? He'll be so happy to hear it. Thank you so much. (calling) Loretta! Put down nuclear power for ten g's. PAN TO Loretta, who chalks the figure onto a toteboard. LORETTA Cool. (into phone) Mr. Newburg? It's Miss Loretta, from Congressman Johnson's office, how you doin'? On Loretta's bulletin board is a map of the United States, with flags, pushpins, and air travel routes. LORETTA Say, the congressman's going to be out your way next week... Palm Springs, the Bob Hope Classic -- yes, a celebrity player. As long as he's on the coast, we were wondering whether you aerospace people might want to lay on a lunch so you can hear his views... Uh-huh ... Uh-huh... Lovely. Now what kind of contribution to his foundation you folks thinking about? \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              65. 97   INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY                                    97 Celia continues her briefing. CELIA ...And in the 1988 study, it was up to eight per hundred-thousand. Um...am I losing you on these mortality rates? TOMMY No, I was just wondering how much of this is a statutory problem, and how much is a regulatory one? I mean, didn't the Merton Act cover most of this? \nCELIA (surprised) Hmmm, that's an excellent point. Let me see something... As she starts rummaging in her briefcase, we TRACK AROUND to a COMPUTER SCREEN on Tommy's desk -- it displays THE EXACT WORDS HE'S JUST SPOKEN. CELIA Wow...you're right. Maybe we can get them to amend Merton-Simmons. RACK FOCUS...reveals REINHARDT in b.g., sitting at another computer terminal. He is typing in Tommy's responses, which appear on Tommy's screen. TOMMY Well, for Merton to apply you have to show high contagion...sounds to me like your contagion rates are no higher than the common clod. In b.g., Reinhardt DIVES FORWARD to his keyboard and begins correcting his typo. Celia looks puzzled. TOMMY Common cold. (beat) Must have picked up a little dyslexia over the weekend. CELIA I see. Well, I must say I'm pretty impressed. TOMMY You're also impressively pretty. (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92           66. 97    CONTINUED:                                                97 Celia is startled. Tommy is embarrassed...the dumb compliment he's just spoken was one Reinhardt typed on the computer screen. CELIA Oh come on... TOMMY You're right. Sorry.      Excuse me a second. (calls out) Arthur? Without explanation, he THROWS HIS PENCIL hard out of frame. \nREINHARDT (O.S.) Ow! 98    EXT. GULF STREAM JET - AIRBORNE - DAY                     98 A jet flies through the sky. 99    INT. GULF STREAM JET - DAY                                99 Tommy and handful of other Members listen to their GUN LOBBYIST host. GUN LOBBYIST Frankly, we    think the semi-automatic has gotten a    bad rap. That's why the American    Sporting Gun Users PAC put together    this trip. ON TOMMY AND DODGE enjoying champagne and hors d'oeuvres. \n100   EXT. DUCK BLIND - DAY                                     100 Tommy, wearing full L.L. Bean drag, wading with the other Members. Someone blows a shrieking DUCK CALL. A flock takes flight. Everyone in the group raises their weapons: AK-47s. A burst of GUNFIRE. Rambo time. We SEE the flock still flying. One duck drops at the feet of the hunters. TOMMY Must have had a heart attack. \nOn the steps, Marshall shakes hands with his Congregants. Tommy and Celia exit the church. Marshall takes Celia by the hands and kisses her familiarly. Tommy is taken aback. MARSHALL Hello, darling. Glad you could make it. CELIA I liked the sermon, Uncle Eli. TOMMY Uncle Eli? MARSHALL My niece says you're not half as slimy as I thought. TOMMY Your niece? \nMARSHALL That would put you somewhere between a lizard and a toad. Quite a step up. Tommy looks from Marshall to Celia and back again. TOMMY How could I have missed the family resemblance? 106   EXT. CANNON BUILDING - DAY - ESTABLISHING                  106 107   INT. CANNON TOP FLOOR - DAY                                107 WHISTLING happily, Tommy rounds the corner and heads to his office.

Tommy adjusts his tie, turns on the charm, and approaches. TOMMY Ladies! Looking good!   How can I help you folks today! But Hattie Rifkin and her troops will have none of it. HATTIE Don't \"Ladies!\" me, you dick! The camera lights go on. \n108   INT. DODGE'S OFFICE - DAY                                 108 DODGE Now let me get this straight. You voted to make people on Medicare pay more money to their doctors? TOMMY The Medical Association made a persuasive case. Ten grand from their PAC, plus Christmas in Aspen. DODGE (shaking his head) Tommy -- if I'm not mistaken, you wouldn't be here without the good senior citizens of your district. You got to dance with the girl that brung you, son. If you have a bit of business to do, do it quietly... in the corridors... in the subcommittees... with little amendments. You mess around on the big ones like Medicare, you'll be dead meat on election day. TOMMY Yeah, well, then it's thanks for the memories, and on to the next gig. DODGE Do you know what your problem is, son? You don't think big enough. You have a real knack for this town, but you have the soul of a two-bit hustler. Listen to me, Tommy. (MORE) (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92            72. 108   CONTINUED:                                                 108 DODGE (CONT'D) Five hundred thirty-five Members of Congress. Some are smart, and some stupid. Some good, some not. But all of them, son, all of them consumed by the single overriding imperative that defines the very Washington way of life. TOMMY Which is? DODGE Getting re-elected. \nTOMMY Wait a minute. You're talkin' 'bout my re-election? DODGE You don't know what percent of the incumbents who ran last time got re-elected, do you? TOMMY Fifty?   Sixty? DODGE Ninety-six. And ninety-eight before that. It's like that election after election. If you don't fuck up, you can be here, raking it in, for life. Life, Johnson. Tommy considers this.   Then a big smile. \nTOMMY I can think of worse places to get life. DODGE (smiles) I knew you had it in you. TOMMY So how do I get the Silver Foxes off my ass? DODGE Oh, throw them a bone... why don't you co-sponsor a bill for mandatory universal health insurance? (CONTINUED) \nMRS. JUBA The studies, the numbers -- it's all there. MICKEY (to Tommy, skeptical) You're not actually going to read those, are you? TOMMY (caught) Oh, they'll be read... MICKEY Why don't you come see for yourself? Tommy has no quick answer. 111   EXT. PARK/SCHOOL - FLORIDA - DAY                           111 \nChildren playing on swings and seesaws in a small public park. TILT UP. A pair of electric power derricks carrying 225,000-volt lines almost directly overhead. The derricks cast shadows across a nearby school. We SEE the neighborhood. Quite a few FOR SALE signs. A house with a moving sale in progress on the front lawn. ON Tommy taking it all in.   With him are Celia and the Jubas. MRS. JUBA Five children   in the neighborhood have cancer.    One more has precancerous   lesions. Pregnant women around   here are scared to death.

JUBA Turns out a lot of schools are near power lines. The land's cheap, so the schools tend to buy it from the power companies in the first place. TOMMY But isn't the school district responsible? MRS. JUBA We asked the superintendent to measure the magnetic field inside the school. He said, Okay, only it'll cost forty thousand dollars, and what program did we want him to cut that from? TOMMY Nice. MRS. JUBA We're nobody, congressman. You're somebody. We need your help. Tommy takes Celia aside. TOMMY Do you believe it? CELIA It's impossible to know. No one's really looked into it hard enough. \nTOMMY But why isn't it being investigated? CELIA Why didn't they investigate breast implants all those years? What about those side-effects of that sleeping pill, Halcion? Why isn't anything being investigated? It's always the same. TOMMY Money talks. CELIA You got it.

CELIA Don't tell me you're actually developing a conscience. TOMMY Shit, I hope not -- it'd be a fucking nuisance in Congress. CELIA No, that's not fair. Some people on the Hill actually believe in things, and try to do a decent job, and don't forget why they went to Washington, and who sent them. TOMMY (amazed) No shit. (remembering) Oh, yeah, I met one of those geeks. So what can I do? CELIA Make a stink. Round up some Members and hold a press conference. Get that committee of yours to hold hearings. Haul in in the Environmental Protection Agency, the Surgeon General, the National Academy of Sciences. Get the issue on every breakfast table in America. \n112    OMITTED                                                     112 112A   INT. POWER AND ENTERPRISE COMMITTEE - DAY                   112A A press conference. Half a dozen congressmen, Tommy among them. Iowa is speaking to the few Cameras and Reporters.

It goes to the right of ordinary people to know all the facts -- (CONTINUED) \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              79. 112A   CONTINUED:                                                   112A TOMMY Yeah, right -- people ought to know if their neighborhoods are killing them. DODGE (O.S.) Amen, gentleman. Amen. They turn, somewhat surprised to see Dick Dodge, who joins Iowa at the microphones, a natural leader. DODGE What a fine effort this is. I am totally sympathetic. Congressional hearings should be scheduled as soon as possible. The American people deserve no less. He puts an arm around Mickey. DODGE Message:   we care. 112B   INT. TOMMY'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                   112B Tommy and Celia are watching the press conference on TV. CELIA Well, congratulations. You've found yourself your own hopeless cause. TOMMY Speaking of hopeless causes... They kiss, and slide OUT OF FRAME. \nTOMMY But there are studies that say -- ZEKE For every study that says one thing, I'll show you a study saying another. We've studied it ourselves. Nada. ANDERSEN There's not a single state health official anywhere in this country who says power lines cause cancer. TOMMY But what if you're wrong? As Tommy persists, Andersen looks increasingly angry. TOMMY People didn't use to say smoking causes cancer, either. What if the evidence is just building, and some day we wake up and discover that your power lines are killing us? ANDERSEN (exploding) \"Kill  us\"? \"Kill us\"? You calling me a  murderer? You're saying there's blood  on these hands? How dare you talk  to me like that, you -- O'Connor puts a restraining arm on Andersen. O'CONNOR Calm down, Olaf, calm down, he didn't mean it that way, did you, son? Alright, gentlemen. Easy.

The outburst makes an impression on Tommy. Tommy I'm just saying, it's worth looking into. ANDERSEN Tommy -- do you want to move the power lines? Do you know how much it would cost to bury them? Millions. Tens of millions. I don't have that money. The state doesn't have that money. You people up here sure don't have that money. You know who'd end up paying for it? Folks who sent you here, that's who. O'CONNOR Now how'd you like the   people in your district to think   of you as the putz who tripled their   electric bill? You think they'd thank   you for that on election day? TOMMY All I'm saying is, maybe we should hold hearings to look at -- O'CONNOR Think for a minute, boychik. You hold your hearings. Overnight, everyone who lives near a substation finds the value of his home in the toilet. You kill the real estate market. \nZEKE You kill the insurance companies. O'CONNOR You kill the school district. ANDERSON You kill the local economy. DODGE For a smart boy, you're not thinking very politically. Tommy watches the LIGHTNING. TOMMY Maybe I should think about it.

ANDERSEN Oh, by the    way, Tommy, on a completely different    subject -- You don't have a state PAC    yet, do you? I'd like to give you a    hundred thousand dollar corporate    contribution to start one up. ZEKE My company would be honored to do the same. \nTJ Can you do that?     I thought there were limits -- O'CONNOR Oh, it's all aboveboard, we all believe deeply in the rules. It's just that the state rules are often more flexible about these things. ANDERSEN Are you interested? TJ I'm always interested in the happiness of my constituents. DODGE I'll drink to that. \nDodge and Andersen shoot each other a look. 116   OMITTED                                                     116 118   EXT.

MARSHALL Don't shit me, Tommy. You're Dick Dodge's yes-man. I know what you're up to. This is damage control. TOMMY I'm not a yes-man. When Dick says no, I say no. Marshall SMASHES down again with the mallet.    Crab carnage. \nMARSHALL You know why no one on the Hill drops a dime on anyone else? Mutual assured destruction. Our little gentleman's agreement. Everybody has something on somebody, so nobody has anything on anybody, because everybody wants to save his own ass. TOMMY (interested) Oh, yeah? What do they have on you?

REINHARDT Excuse me, congressman, could I just do a couple of quick calendar things with you? MARSHALL (to Loretta) Would you care for a drink? LORETTA Tell you the truth, nothing for me. MARSHALL Well, when a pretty lady shoots him down, an old man knows it's time to go home. Marshall rises, pulling out his car keys. MARSHALL You kids have a good time.

A quiet moment. REVERSE ANGLE - TWO SHOT.   Mickey is shuffling a deck of cards. MICKEY Is it thumb over, or thumb under? TOMMY Under. She tries her hand at a false shuffle. TOMMY Not bad, kid.    You've got potential. MICKEY So what's happening? I thought you were going to kick some ass on -- She indicates the derricks.      Tommy looks at her, comes to a decision. TOMMY I am. He takes the deck from her, fans it face up, pulls all the kings and aces, stacks them on top, and squares the deck. TOMMY This is one's called the double duke. How many players? MICKEY Six. TOMMY Who's the mark?

MICKEY Number two -- over there. Tommy, smiling, calculates something for a moment, then gives the deck four shuffles. He hands Mickey the cards. TOMMY Your deal. She deals out six hands in a circle on the ground. TOMMY Look at the sucker's hand. \nShe turns over the hand at number two.   It has the four kings. Mickey WHISTLES at the hand. TOMMY Look at your hand. She turns over her own hand. It has the four aces. Mickey looks at the power lines, at the hands, at TJ. Then, understanding: MICKEY That's what you're going to do? Tommy nods.   Her face opens into a big smile. MICKEY Let's kick some ass.    What do I do? TOMMY Something very important. \n139   INT. TOMMY'S LIVING ROOM - DAY                             139 Tommy pow-wows with Loretta Van Dyke, and Armando.   Aside from a sling, Loretta looks okay. VAN DYKE Why are we meeting here, Tommy? There trouble at the office? TOMMY (impersonating Dodge) \"I keep my ear close to the ground.\" His ear my ass. He had an inside man. ARMANDO That little fuck Reinhardt? (CONTINUED) \nHOMER (after a moment) Alright. The White House is putting heat on the EPA. They want us to announce a major investigation of the relation between power lines and cancer clusters. REINHARDT But didn't the EPA already do a study? HOMER Yeah, but when the draft got to the White House, they didn't like it. So they brought their own scientists in to kill it.

HOMER Who knows? TOMMY Is there new evidence? HOMER Yeah -- their polls have dropped like a rock. They need an issue. This one makes them look good on the environment, and they don't have to spend a penny. TOMMY And what good is this to me? HOMER Come on, congressman, in this town, information is currency. And advance information is gold. Reinhardt nods in agreement. HOMER But you've    got to move fast. Once the White    House goes public with this, they    can't turn back. If your friends at    the power company want to kill this    investigation, they'd better do it now.     Evening, gentlemen. \nAfter Homer leaves: REINHARDT Blueboy. Twenty to one. Is your Cousin Henry always right? TOMMY I ain't got no Cousin Henry. 142   EXT. PAY PHONE - BY REFLECTING POOL - NIGHT                142 Reinhardt dials. MRS. DODGE'S VOICE (V.O.) Hello?

The Arts Caucus breakfast is ending. \nTHIRD MEMBER Unless there is further business, our caucus stands adjourned. Dodge gets up.    As he makes to leave, Tommy comes in. TOMMY Got a minute, Dick? Tommy takes him aside.    The room empties except for them. TOMMY Listen, Dick, I heard something. There's got to be some bid'ness in it. Tommy very discreetly gestures with his thumb and palm: money. TOMMY Maybe we can go in on it together. \nDODGE I'm listening. TOMMY The EPA is going to make a stink about power lines. The White House is pushing them to do a big study. DODGE That's very interesting, my friend. I've heard that, too. TOMMY (acting surprised) Nothing gets by, do it? Tommy touches his nose, in tribute to the master.

We do make quite a team, don't we? TOMMY I -- I hope it wasn't my press conference that started this. DODGE No, this is a stunt for the polls. TOMMY So do you think there's something in it for us? \nTOMMY Morning, Reinhardt! Got a minute? I need your advice on something. REINHARDT Sure. Tommy leads him back into the corridor. 157   INT.

Yes, I'm calling from Chairman Dodge's office, on the Hill. We wanted to be sure CNN was sending a crew to the Clean Air hearing today. \nARMANDO (OVERLAPPING) No, not the new emission standards. We're breaking news. This is the biggest thing since Watergate. LORETTA (OVERLAPPING) This is Cynthia Leeson in the White House Press Office. My boss wanted me to let you folks know -- we're making a major announcement at the Clean Air hearings today. (listens) No, I can't tell you, but it's hot. (listens) Well, if the New York Times wants to be the only paper in town to miss the story of the year, that's up to y'all. \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92              109A. 158   INT. TOMMY'S CAGE/CORRIDOR - DAY                             158 Tommy has drawn Reinhardt into the cage. TOMMY I want to do a little    something nice for Dodge. That     EPA thing -- he's been good to me,    Reinhardt. Is there some way I can,    like, throw a bouquet to him at the    hearing today without having to sit    through that boring testimony    shit? REINHARDT Why don't you ask him to give you the floor at the start? \nTOMMY He's do that? REINHARDT For some flattery? In a New York minute. Just tip him ahead of time. TOMMY Good thinking. They return to the corridor.     Tommy looks at his watch. TOMMY Say, Reinhardt, my Grandma's plane comes in at ten. You wouldn't mind picking her up and driving Miss Daisy around, would you? REINHARDT Can't one of the others do it? \nTOMMY No, I don't trust them the way I trust you. TOMMY pats him on the back and sends him on his way. 159   INT. TOMMY'S OFFICE - DAY                                    159 Tommy, joined by his cronies and the Jubas. TOMMY This is it, people.     Game time.   Let's get it right. ARMANDO Tell me one thing, jefe. How do you know Andersen is going to bite? TOMMY I don't.   You run a con, you run a risk. \nTHE DISTINGUISHED GENTLEMAN - Rev. 4/3/92             110. 160   INT. POWER AND ENTERPRISE COMMITTEE - DAY                 160 A hundred or so members of the public -- trade groups, Hill staffers, lawyers, tourists -- settle into their seats. VAN DYKE escorts Hattie Rifkin and a busload of Silver Foxes. Loretta comes in with Ellen and Mickey Juba. GRANDMA comes in, on Reinhardt's arm. She is dressed up as a biddy, down to a hat with fruit on it. COMMITTEE MEMBERS head for their seats at the dais. OLAF ANDERSEN is at the witness table, along with a couple of other businessmen. In a seat behind Andersen, Tommy O'Connor. THE PRESS.   A good turnout, with several camera crews. WASHINGTON REPORTER #1 You know what this is? WASHINGTON REPORTER #2 (confidential) It's very hot. Electric cars. CELIA is seated with Ira, her Pro Bono associate. CELIA I'm cutting out early. IRA (indicating TJ) Don't want to run into him? \nCELIA You got that right. AT THE DAIS Tommy has a private word with Dodge. TOMMY Dick, I thought it might be a nice way to open if I congratulated you on the fine work you been doin' on this committee. Really express our appreciation. Especially on behalf of the minority community. DODGE Why, thank you, son.

HOMER and ARMANDO are delighted. TOMMY Isn't that right, Mr. Andersen? Tommy flicks his eyebrows at Andersen, provocatively, imitating Dodge. ANDERSEN That's a vicious lie. Dodge GAVELS sharply, turns to Tommy. DODGE Will the gentleman yield? ANDERSEN That's not possible! You can't give anyone that kind of money! Dodge continues GAVELING. TOMMY Oh, yes, you can. As Mr. O'Connor said to you, quote: \"If that's what you want, we can always find a loophole. No one will know.\" Remember saying that, Tommy? O'CONNOR I do not! DODGE (standing) I insist that the gentlemen yield! \nTommy also stands, and produces a video tape. TOMMY You can't deny it, Mr. Andersen! We have the whole thing on this tape! The room erupts. THE PRESS loves it. Still cameras CLICK and WHIR. DODGE despairs. REINHARDT puts his hand over his face. TOMMY Yesterday, at Chairman Dodge's courageous suggestion, I taped the whole conversation. It's all there. Mr. Chairman, I thank you. The people thank you. America thanks you.

The clapping is considerably sweetened by the Panthers and the rest of Tommy's claque. DODGE gauges their reaction, gets an inspiration. The storm leaves his face, and becomes a smile, which he beams on Tommy. DODGE I thank the distinguished gentleman. And I thank my fellow citizens. Our methods in this investigation may have been unorthodox, but together -- (indignant, at Andersen) we have exposed a canker at the very heart of democracy. \nAPPLAUSE. Tommy is amazed at Dodge's survival skills. REINHARDT, delighted at the turn, claps heartily. ANDERSEN, livid, leaps up and shouts at Dodge. ANDERSEN You bastard!    You set me up! DODGE Witness is out of order! ANDERSEN You stood to make a million bucks off of me! Who offered you more? I want to know! A new BUZZ sweeps the room. O'Connor tries to restrain Andersen, who sloughs him off. ANDERSEN You're as big a whore as he is! MICKEY JUBA catches Tommy's eye and mouths a question. MICKEY Now? Tommy shakes his head:   no. 161   INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY                                   161 The phone by Eli Marshall's bed RINGS.    He answers. MARSHALL Hello?  No. You're joking.

POWER AND ENTERPRISE COMMITTEE - DAY                 162 ANDERSEN There's no loyalty any more, is there, Dick? What about the three hundred grand you squeezed from me for that goddam voter registration front of yours -- that just water under the bridge? O'Connor tries again to restrain him. ANDERSEN Don't touch me, you scum! MICKEY JUBA mouths: \nMICKEY Now? Tommy shakes his head again.    No. ANDERSEN What about the two hundred k for your phony foundation, Dick? How about the ten thousand copies if your goddam autobiography you muscled me to buy -- what's all that, ancient history? Andersen advances toward the dais, pointing now to six or seven other Members of the Committee among the total of ANDERSEN And you -- what about those bundled checks from my executives? I gave you my condo in Vail! I gave you my corporate jet to fly all over the world! I gave your kids summer jobs! I put up scholarships to put your kids through college! I hired your goddam wife to redecorate my office! You telling me none of that counts for anything? Andersen grabs Dodge by the throat. ANDERSEN I thought you people were for sale! I was wrong -- you're just for rent! Dodge struggles free of Andersen, who is dragged away from Dodge by Capitol Police.

Everything I've done has been completely legal! TOMMY (acting astonished) Mr. Chairman! You mean to say you did all that stuff? You took all that money? Shock in the room. Some BOOS. IOWA does a nice HOG CALL. TJ sends a little wave and smile to Celia. DODGE There's nothing I've done that -- (indicating other Members) -- that these gentlemen haven't done! Committee Members rush to dissociate themselves from Dodge. MEMBERS No!... Not me!... Just him!... I never!... He crossed the line! ANDERSEN They're whores! All of them! MICKEY JUBA tries again.

Going to the best resorts in the world and calling it \"official business.\" Golfing and skiing and fishing, and never picking up a tab. And, Jeff -- there's no aphrodisiac like power. You can have some of the most intelligent, attractive women in the country. You've got it made! JOHNSON Oh, I suppose that one-point-three may seem like spare change to the head of Gulf Coast Power, but to a country boy like me -- ANDERSEN Okay, Jeff. I get it. Look. There's a little software company that's about to go through the roof. Johnson smiles at the direction the conversation is taking. ON Tommy also smiling, in admiration at the transaction going down. \nANDERSEN A few thousand worth of stock options would stand to make you quite a pile. As long as your blind trust buys them, you're clean -- the SEC can't shake a stick at you. Half a million, easy -- and that's just a start. JOHNSON Well, if you put it like that...

In the reflections on the frames, we GLIMPSE some MOVEMENT on the desk explaining the considerable BREATHING and MOANING (O.S.). JOHNSON (O.S.) Oh my God.     Oh my God. Oh my... But then a strange GURGLING sound (O.S.) escapes from Johnson. JOHNSON (O.S.) ... God. A silent beat.   Then a horrified CRY.      Jennifer rises INTO FRAME.

We SEE the widow Johnson. At her side, in the aisle seat, a powerful man with bushy eyebrows, about 60, in a three-piece suit and watch chain: congressman DICK DODGE. The HYMN ends. Dodge steps up to the pulpit. DODGE It was my honor to serve in Congress with Jeff Johnson for a generation. No one could have been a better legislator. No one could have been a finer husband and father. And now -- He presses the tips of his fingers together and looks skyward, as if communing with his memory of the deceased. \nDODGE And now God has called his servant home. ANGLE ON Jennifer, in black. DODGE (O.S.) We will miss him. But we are grateful that his passing was so peaceful -- and so like him -- working late into the night at his desk, the consummate public servant.

Dodge   puts a gentle hand on the widow's shoulder and draws  her aside. He throws a look at Jennifer, who joins  them. DODGE Vera, I know you're still in shock from Jeff's... passing. But we have to talk about his seat. Vera stares at Jennifer.   She knows the score. \nJENNIFER Mrs. Johnson, if you'd like to discuss this in private -- VERA You can stay -- what's the difference? DODGE Vera, I'd like you to announce that you're going to run for Congress. Let a few days pass to show proper respect. But next week, I want to stand next to you at a press conference where you declare for Jeff's seat in the House.

Grandma comes in from the kitchen, shaking her head. GRANDMA How did I end up with a thief for a grandson? TOMMY Grandma -- I told you.    I'm not a thief. I'm a con man.     An artist.

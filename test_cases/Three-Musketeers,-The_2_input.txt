D'ARTAGNAN My sword -- ROCHEFORT It's magnificent. Where did you get it? 
Rochefort steps INTO VIEW, the familiar eyepatch, admiring d'Artagnan's sword in his hands. D'ARTAGNAN (after a beat) It belonged to my father. ROCHEFORT Your father... 
Rochefort studies d'Artagnan for a long moment, then... ROCHEFORT Well now it belongs to me. I collect swords. I take them from the men I kill. 
D'ARTAGNAN I'm not dead yet. D'Artagnan starts forward. But Rochefort raises the sword, points it at his throat. D'Artagnan freezes, feels the sharp tip of the blade. ROCHEFORT Soon enough. 
Rochefort shoves d'Artagnan back to the floor with a heavy boot. A beat. D'Artagnan peers at his dismal surroundings.

ROCHEFORT I'll give you a hint. It's not the Louvre. 
D'ARTAGNAN (realizing) The Bastille! I'm in the Bastille! 
ROCHEFORT Well, you're the first person who was ever happy to be here. Unfortunately, your visit will be a short one. 
D'ARTAGNAN What do you mean? ROCHEFORT You killed one of the Cardinal's Guards. An offense punishable by death. D'ARTAGNAN He interrupted a duel I was fighting. 
ROCHEFORT Also punishable by death. D'ARTAGNAN It was a long day. ROCHEFORT You know them? 
D'ARTAGNAN Who? 
ROCHEFORT The Musketeers. D'Artagnan says nothing.     He will not betray them. Rochefort leans close. 
ROCHEFORT Tell me where they are, and I will be lenient. 
D'ARTAGNAN How? (CONTINUED) 
49   CONTINUED:    (2)                                             49 ROCHEFORT (after a beat) I will give you your father's sword. A long beat. D'Artagnan eyes the gleaming saber, forged in the Crusades. He nods, gestures for Rochefort to come closer. As if to impart a secret. Rochefort tilts downward, d'Artagnan rises up... and whispers. D'ARTAGNAN Give me my father's sword, and I'll cut out your heart. Bold words, bad timing. Rochefort snarls, slams the hilt of the sword into d'Artagnan's head. The youth slumps from the wooden stool to the floor, unconscious. ROCHEFORT Fool.   Like your father. Rochefort storms from the cell. He nods at a grizzled jailer on his way out, indicates the chains and manacles on the cell wall. The jailer scurries over to d'Artagnan, inert in a shallow puddle of foul water. He lifts, drags him toward the chains -- but d'Artagnan's eyes pop open, the jailer reacts with surprise, and... CUT TO: 50   INT. BASTILLE - CORRIDOR - NIGHT                              50 The jailer exits from d'Artagnan's cell, closes the heavy door behind him. A CLOSER look reveals d'Artagnan in the jailer's soiled tunic, eyes bright with adventure. He looks left and right -- dank corridors, darkness, the OCCASIONAL GROAN. And steps lightly into the shadows. 
51   ON D'ARTAGNAN                                                 51 
He seeks exit, finds only a labyrinth. Two jailers con- verse, step towards him. D'Artagnan leaps into a cell doorway, allows them to pass. Suddenly: scabrous hands reach from inside the cell, grab d'Artagnan by the throat. He shudders, leaps free. And continues. 
D'Artagnan steps     deeper in the labyrinth. Frustrated, no way out. Just      then: more FOOTSTEPS heading toward him. D'Artagnan      seeks refuge, watches as a cloaked figure steps INTO     VIEW, accompanied by a retinue of sullen jailers. D'Artagnan thinks fast... and joins them. 
CUT TO: 
52   INT. BASTILLE - NIGHT                                       52 D'Artagnan keeps step with the cloaked figure, the ret- inue. He keeps his head down, glances at the corridor ahead, looking for a way out. But the cloaked figure is escorted up a long stairway, into another hall, and toward a pristine wooden door. D'Artagnan watches as the door opens, revealing... Cardinal Richelieu, a fear- some apparition in red, the most powerful man in France. 
D'Artagnan's jaw drops. The cloaked figure steps inside. The jailers disperse. D'Artagnan takes steps as if to join them... then turns back, eyes the door, the Cardinal and the cloaked figure now behind it. 
53   ANGLE TO INCLUDE INTERIOR                                   53 
The cloaked figure bows to the Cardinal. Richelieu smiles, concupiscent. Rochefort stands in a corner, ignored for the moment. RICHELIEU I have an errand that requires your singular talents.

PRINCE What you want is money. 
Haven nods. 
CHARLIE I don't see how going to the law will get it for you. 
HAVEN If you did see how, I'd never get there, would I? 
CHARLIE I'm afraid not. 
HAVEN So it boils down to this: we can make a deal, and all be happy together. 
PRINCE Not as long as you always have something on us. 
HAVEN Unless you also have something on me. 
CHARLIE And how would that be? 
HAVEN When I deliver the gold to you. 
CHARLIE You mean the gear box? 
HAVEN I can even forget I looked inside. So I stole a gear box... I'm still a thief. 
Charlie is silent a moment. Haven lights his pipe. Charlie looks at Mark, pale by the wall. 
PRINCE (indicating Mark) What does he get? 
HAVEN He gets even with you. 
PRINCE Have you lost your mind! 
HAVEN It was all right when he lost his money. 
CHARLIE All right... I'll give him the IOU's... when the gear box is delivered. 
PRINCE (smiling) You don't realize how important it is when a piece of machinery breaks down. It could close the entire sawmill. 
HAVEN I guess I didn't realize it. 
She looks coolly at Mick and Mark. 
CHARLIE I think that's all. 
Mark glances at Haven who nods and Mark leaves in the wake of the grimly departing Mick. Prince lingers. 
CHARLIE (to Haven) You can stay. 
HAVEN (to Prince) I think she was talking to me. 
Prince gets up grimly, his lips tight, the dice held hard in his fingers. He stares at Haven. 
PRINCE You roll nice dice and you bet them jamb up, but some day you'll slip. And when you do, I'll be around to catch you. 
He turns and walks out. Haven watches him go. 
HAVEN You know, I think he will. 
CHARLIE Then you should be more careful. 
HAVEN The poorhouses are filled with careful men... (knocking out his pipe) ...And so are the graveyards. 
Charlie comes around and sits on the arm of his chair. 
HAVEN You've got a nice perfume. 
CHARLIE Carnation. (she ruffles his hair with her hand) I almost had to have you killed. I'd have hated it. 
HAVEN So would I. 
CHARLIE I'd have missed you... too much. 
HAVEN And too long. 
She brushes his cheek with her lips. 
CHARLIE (she smiles at him) Did you ever tell a woman you loved her? 
HAVEN All of them. 
CHARLIE How did you get away? 
HAVEN I was always in the doorway when I said it. 
CHARLIE You never said it to me. 
HAVEN Let's go over to the doorway.

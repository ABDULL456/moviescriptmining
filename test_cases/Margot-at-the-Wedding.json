{"train": "INGRID Mom, can you hide this please. \nPauline puts the record sleeve on top of a shelf. \nPAULINE (for Margot's benefit) Malcolm played with Ric Ocasek once? \nMALCOLM In the late `80's. It was a solo gig after he left the Cars. \nCLAUDE So, you're kind of famous. \nMalcolm reddens. \nMALCOLM No. No. Believe me, I'm not. I used to want to be, but, No. Do you want to be famous? \nMARGOT Claude wants to be very famous. \nMALCOLM Well, make sure you can handle rejection. I can't. For me, expectation just turns to disappointment. So, ultimately I'd rather not try. It'll all go black for us soon enough anyway. \nPAULINE Claude, ignore him. \nPauline sneaks a look at Margot who is watching Malcolm with an expression of either contempt or confusion. Pauline grows uncomfortable. She says to Claude: \nPAULINE When your mother moved to New York she used to send me books and records. She sent me REM's Murmur... MARGOT And the Pixies. \nPAULINE And X. She was very cool your mother. \nMARGOT You only liked top forty. \nPAULINE Yeah, but I love REM now. \nMargot takes off her reading glasses and rubs her eyes. \nMARGOT I don't really listen to music anymore. \nPAULINE I was dating that guy, Horace back then. Remember him? \nMARGOT Was that the guy who liked to rough you up? \nPAULINE No, that was our dad. \nPauline and Margot crack up laughing.   Malcolm raises an eyebrow at Claude. \nMARGOT Our father used to strip down to his skivvies and beat us with a belt. \nMALCOLM That man had a sexual screw loose. \nPAULINE It's awful -- that stuff that happens to kids. Malcolm was fondled by a male baby-sitter. MALCOLM Just use that information however you want... PAULINE Sorry. We're with family.     I figured... Claude looks at Malcolm.   Malcolm doesn't meet his eyes. \nPAULINE I think Becky got it the worst. \nMARGOT Did she ever. Raped by the horse trainer... \nMargot breaks into laughter. Pauline spits her seltzer back into the glass. They both laugh hysterically. Tears stream down Margot's face. Claude watches. \n12   EXT. PATIO - NIGHT                                         12 \nMalcolm, Pauline, Margot, Claude and Ingrid sit with a homosexual couple, Alan, 40's, and Toby, 30's, and their son, Bruce, 8, at an old wooden table eating crab, salad and soup. Part of Alan's face is paralyzed. \nTOBY Alan rolled over in bed and looked at me and he said I can't feel my face. It took three doctors before we knew it was Bells Palsy. \nALAN They say a brush of wind can do it. \nTOBY Feeling is slowly coming back. \nJIM'S VOICE Yes. \nMARGOT This is happening and you have to get your mind around that. 15   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM - NIGHT                             15 Claude sleeps in bed.    Margot gently touches his face.   She whispers: MARGOT Are you asleep? \nCLAUDE (softly) Yes. \nMARGOT Will you remember this? \nCLAUDE Yes. \nMARGOT I just talked to your dad... \nClaude's eyes remained closed, but he smiles. \nMARGOT I'm only going to tell you if you won't remember. \nCLAUDE Okay. \nMargot hesitates.    She changes her mind and says thoughtfully: \nMARGOT Everyone finds you so funny and charming. I always get compliments about you. \nMargot stands. She catches herself in a warped mirror and smears some eye make-up off of her face. \nMARGOT Are you having fun?    Is it nice to see Pauline? \nCLAUDE (opens his eyes) Yeah, I really like her. \nMARGOT Yeah.     She is crazy though. CLAUDE In what way? MARGOT She's really berserk. Maybe it's hormones. You don't notice anything different about Pauline? CLAUDE No. \nMARGOT She's pregnant -- she told me. But she's keeping it a secret -- I mean from Malcolm and even Ingrid. Which I think is unforgiveable. Now she'll have to marry him. What's she planning -- to get married and not drink champagne? Then she'll just be lying. I guess she's afraid she'll miscarry. She probably will. I think on some level she's ambivalent about the marriage and that's why she's not telling him. \nCLAUDE Are you stoned, Mom? \nMARGOT Maybe a little. \nCLAUDE I don't like it. \n16   INT. MALCOLM AND PAULINE'S ROOM - NIGHT                     16 \nWater runs from the bathroom. Malcolm cradles a glass of whiskey and stands nude in front of a full length mirror. \nMALCOLM (shakes his head) My scrotum is longer than my penis. \nHe turns around and looks at his ass. Pauline walks out of the bathroom. She wears mens pajamas, the top open. \nMALCOLM It's sweet how Claude looks up to me. He waits for a reaction and gets none. \nMALCOLM Margot doesn't seem as crazy as you made her out to be. PAULINE What she did to Toby and Alan tonight didn't seem crazy enough for you? MALCOLM I guess that seemed pretty crazy. \nPAULINE (immediately defensive) Well, she cares deeply. \nMALCOLM Yeah, she's really worried about Bruce. \nPAULINE This has nothing to do with Bruce. She thinks everyone is autistic. \nMalcolm is about to speak, but instead he halts, paralyzed. \nPAULINE What? \nMALCOLM Nothing, you keep changing your position -- I'm just trying to figure out if I should agree with you or not? \nPAULINE Well, can't she be both, care deeply and be crazy? Do people have to be all one thing? \nMargot places her mallet down and starts toward the house. \nCLAUDE We're in the middle of it. \nMARGOT This is why I hate games.    I hate what it does to me. \nPauline cackles loudly. Margot turns around and stares at her. Malcolm calls from the stairs: \nMALCOLM (O.S.) Wait, we're not finished! \n19   EXT. PATIO - DAY                                                19 \nThe five eat a salad nicoise lunch. \nMARGOT Malcolm, do you notice how Pauline sometimes can't make eye-contact. How her gaze hovers just above your head. \nMALCOLM Yeah, I kind of know what you mean. \nMARGOT I always think I have something in my hair. It's not necessarily bad, Paul. It's just something you do. \nPauline looks mildly horrified.   She suddenly turns to Claude. PAULINE Claude have you ever seen your mother climb a tree? \nCLAUDE No. \nMARGOT We don't have much opportunity in Manhattan. \nPAULINE As kids Margot climbed everything. She could even climb that tree. \nShe points at the tall oak that stretches over the fence into the neighbor's property. \nCLAUDE Can you do it, mom? \nMARGOT Maybe later. \nCLAUDE No, now. \nINGRID Do it now, Margot! \nPAULINE Show him, Margot. \n20   CUT TO:                                                       20 \nMargot strides toward the tree.   The group follows behind. \nShe grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself. \nClaude grins, impressed. \nWith brisk dexterity, Margot scales the tree. \nClaude, Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid watch with glee from below. \nPAULINE I told you. Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the gang. They wave. She waves back. The sun is hot. She sweats, flushed. She takes a deep breath and relaxes against the bark. Trees for miles. The neighbors' house is faded and grey. In the far distance, toxic white smoke comes out into the sky. \nAn earwig walks across her arm. She flicks it off, slips for a moment and catches herself. Her breathing grows more rapid. \nA bug buzzes around her head.   She swats at it. \nHer family has stopped watching. Claude and Malcolm throw a baseball. Pauline's gone back inside. Ingrid clears the table. \nMARGOT (under her breath) Shit. \nShe wipes her face, her shirt is almost entirely soaked.    The buzzing continues. \nMARGOT I think it was the only time we could really feel unselfconscious and get out of our heads. \nPAULINE (dismissive) I don't think that's it. I just think it was something we were good at. \nBehind, Ingrid smacks her walking stick into Claude's. \nINGRID Your mom thinks Bruce is gay. \nCLAUDE No, she said she had Aspergers. \nINGRID I thought that's what that means. \nCLAUDE No, it's like lesser retarded. \nINGRID I have adult ADD. \nCLAUDE You mean child ADD. \nINGRID No, for some reason I have the adult one. Maybe I'm retarded. Up ahead -- in the path -- is a couple, 40's, with a six year old girl. The back of the man's pants are smeared with dirt and the woman is packed into acid washed jeans. The little girl whines and lags behind. Margot and Pauline slow down.   Claude and Ingrid catch up. MAN Come on! LITTLE GIRL I don't want to! \nMAN Come on! \nLITTLE GIRL I don't want -- \nThe woman grabs the girl harshly by the arm and pulls her. The girl screams. \nMARGOT Hey! \nThe man and woman turn around sharply. \nMARGOT Be careful! \nWOMAN What? \nMARGOT Be careful the way you pull on that child's arm. You'll take it out of its socket. \nMAN Don't tell us how to treat our child. \nMARGOT I don't care how you treat your child as long as you don't hurt him. \nPAULINE (under her breath) It's a girl. \nWOMAN She threw a rock at me. MARGOT She's a little girl! WOMAN She knew what she was doing. She starts suddenly toward Margot. WOMAN There is no hitting in our family. Do you understand? \nMargot backs up quickly.    The woman stops about ten feet away. \nWOMAN Stay out of it, bitch. \nThe woman turns back around. She lifts the girl into her arms and they trudge over the incline and out of sight. \nINGRID That was the Voglers. \nPAULINE Jesus, Margot, what are you doing. They already hate us. \nMARGOT (wiping her eyes) Don't tell me what I can and can't do. That's child abuse. \nCLAUDE Mom, she was psychotic. \nMARGOT Stop picking on me.    Everyone. \n24   CUT TO:                                                         24 \nThe four of them emerge into a clearing.     Nobody speaks.    A child's pink sneaker lies in the path. \nPAULINE We didn't invite them to the wedding. \nMARGOT You're not really friends. \nPAULINE We're friends enough that's it's awkward. Maisy baby-sits for us all the time. \nMARGOT He's doing the interview with me in town on Friday. Did I tell you, he and I are collaborating on a screenplay, an adaptation of one of Dick's novels. \nPAULINE No, I didn't even know you knew he was up here. \nMalcolm takes one of Ingrid's markers and doodles. \nMALCOLM Is he even a good writer?    Why do people care about him? \nPAULINE You're competitive with everyone. It doesn't matter if they even do the same thing as you. (to Claude) He's competitive with Bono. \nMALCOLM It's true. I don't subscribe to the credo that there's enough room for everyone to be successful. I think there are only a few spots available and people like Dick Koosman and Bono are taking them up. \nPauline looks at Malcolm's drawing.    It's a graphic image of a man fucking a woman in the ass. \nPAULINE Malcolm, what would ever make you think that's something to draw right now? \nClaude and Ingrid stare at it.    Malcolm balls it up. \nMALCOLM Sorry, I wasn't thinking about it. Sorry, Margot. \n28   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                               28 \nThe car pulls into a driveway.    A modern house.   Dick and Maisy come out to greet them. \nDICK You found it! \nMargot, the kids and Pauline get out. We stay in the car with Malcolm. Pauline comes to his window. \nPAULINE What's up? \nMALCOLM I don't want to do this... \nPAULINE Come on, don't be that way. \nMaisy sits on the hood of the car and Ingrid introduces her to Claude. Dick approaches Margot -- she turns back to Pauline. \nMALCOLM I'm not being that way -- I just don't feel like it. I'm going to go back and... I have work to do. PAULINE Dick doesn't care that you don't make any money. MALCOLM Is that why you think... That's not why I'm...I just hate swimming. I really hate it. It's disgusting to me. My mistake was saying I'd do it to begin with. You have fun. PAULINE Fine, we'll have fun. \nMalcolm's gaze goes to Maisy's breasts.    Margot watches him watch her. \nMALCOLM People always pee in the pool. \nPAULINE I don't think Dick and Maisy pee in their pool. \nMALCOLM I'll bet you 500 dollars there's pee in that pool. \n29   EXT. DICK'S POOL - DAY                                       29 \nPauline and Margot float beneath Claude who stands above them. \nPAULINE To the end and back.   Claude, you say Go. \nCLAUDE Okay. \nMargot knocks on the side of her head with her hand. \nCLAUDE Go! \nMARGOT Out with Paul and Malcolm and Dick. \nCLAUDE Are kids coming? \n36   INT. LIVING ROOM - NIGHT                                  36 \nClaude's POV through the window: Dick and Margot in the back seat of the Volvo. Malcolm and Pauline the front. The ignition turns. \nClaude leaves the window. We hear the car rumble away. Claude and Ingrid sit on the couch, hamburgers in front of them. Maisy is cross-legged on Wizard's dog bed and chews a stalk of celery. \nINGRID Who do we know who's gay? MAISY How do I know what gay people you know. CLAUDE Alan and Toby. INGRID And Bruce.     He's gay and Aspergers. \nCLAUDE I don't know if Bruce is gay. \nINGRID He might be, it's very common. \nCLAUDE Your mom is pregnant. \nINGRID No she isn't. \nCLAUDE She is. \nIngrid looks stricken. \nMAISY How do you know that, Claude? \nCLAUDE She told my mom. But you can tell - - she's hormonally weird. \nMAISY Holy shit, Ingrid you're going to have a baby sister or brother. \nINGRID (quietly) My mom thinks your mom is unreliable. \nCLAUDE Who cares. \nBut he does. Claude bites into his burger. His eyes fix on the crease between Maisy's breasts. Maisy says to Claude: \nMAISY Do you think your mom is fuckable? CLAUDE I don't know. MAISY I think she's hot, your mother. I'd do her if I was gay. I might anyway. I mean if she came on to me. CLAUDE She won't. \nINGRID I'm not going to do anyone. \nThere's a scraping sound on the window.   The kids turn quickly: \nCLAUDE What was that? \nINGRID Is it scary? \n37   EXT. FIELD - NIGHT                                          37 \nThe three kids lie in the grass and watch through the slats in the fence: The Vogler family eats at an outdoor table. A pig turns on a spit over a smoky barbecue. Mrs. Vogler says something and the kids and Mr. Vogler laugh. \nMaisy climbs over Claude to see better. He feels her breasts press against his back. Suddenly he swats crazily at his ear. Ingrid is poking him with a blade of grass. \n38   INT. VOLVO - NIGHT                                          38 \nMalcolm drives quickly with Pauline next to him. He's smoking with the window open, Dick and Margot in the backseat. \nPAULINE Margot used to never speak. I remember when we went on a double date in high school, that kid Ron asked you if English was your first language. \nMARGOT It's true. I used to think I might have some kind of brain defect. PAULINE You thought you were aphasic. MARGOT I'm still not sure. PAULINE Oh, Jesus, Margot. MARGOT It's very possible, Paul. \nPAULINE I just...your diagnoses sometimes irk the hell out of me. \nMalcolm lights another cigarette -- the car jerks sideways. \nCLAUDE I just want to keep it. \nINGRID I left a piece of skin in a movie theater once so it could watch movies all its life. \nCLAUDE I don't know if it's the same thing. \nINGRID Are you obsessed with Maisy? \nCLAUDE No. \nINGRID You're always staring at her tits. \nIngrid traces Claude's upper lip with her finger. \nINGRID You have a moustache. \nCLAUDE My mom bleaches it. \nINGRID I'm going to kiss your cheek and then you kiss mine. \nCLAUDE I don't want to do that. \nINGRID Why not? CLAUDE Because it's pointless... Claude hears footsteps creak downstairs. He goes to the door and peers out: Pauline and Malcolm, a little disheveled and dirty, climb the stairs. Neither speaks. Malcolm goes into the hall bathroom. Pauline into their room. Running water groans through the old pipes. \nINGRID Where are you going? I thought we were having a conversation. \nCLAUDE You're starting to annoy me. \n40   INT. HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS                                    40 \nClaude walks -- he passes an open door: Malcolm is shaving his moustache -- the electric razor whirring. \n41   INT. MARGOT'S ROOM - CONTINUOUS                              41 \nClaude enters.   It's empty. Her brown notebook rests on the bedside table.   He hesitates then opens it: \nIt's packed with writing -- a nearly indecipherable cursive in black ink. The name Claude can be made out on the page. \nClaude takes the book and climbs up into bed. He nestles against the pillow and squints to read the writing. \nMARGOT (O.S.) What are you doing? \nClaude startles.   Margot stands in the doorway with a glass of water. \nCLAUDE I didn't think you came home. \nMARGOT Where would I be? \nCLAUDE Can't Josh and Dad come to the wedding? \nMARGOT We've been through this.    Go to bed. Claude slides down to the floor.    He hesitates. CLAUDE Can I sleep in here? MARGOT No, honey. CLAUDE We can put a pillow between us. \nMARGOT Okay.   Just for tonight. \nClaude takes a long pillow and places it like a barrier in the bed. We stay on him as he waits. Finally Margot climbs into the covers in a nightgown. \nMARGOT When you were a baby I wouldn't let anyone else hold you. I think that may have been a mistake. \n42   EXT. HOUSE - MORNING                                       42 \nMalcolm, his moustache gone, a cigarette dangling from his mouth, hammers in a stake at the base of a collapsed, white tent. A workman holds a pole steadily. \nPauline sets up chairs around a series of tables. Ingrid idles a few feet away. They're in the midst of talking: \nCLAUDE What's the Forum? \nMARGOT Like a cult. \nCLAUDE She was in a cult? \nMARGOT Years ago. She and Lenny also followed some guru who was a follower of the Mukdananda who made her drink his bath water. Who knows what she's doing now. INGRID (O.S.) Margot!   Claude! 44   EXT. FIELD - DAY                                          44 Claude hacks his way through the tall weeds. CLAUDE Wizard! We move past him, obscured by grass, Pauline and Ingrid yell: \nPAULINE/INGRID Wizard!    Wiz! \nMargot enters the frame.   The kids walk ahead. \nMARGOT Wizard!    Here, boy! \nShe stands a few feet away from Pauline.   The kids can be heard shouting in the distance. \nMARGOT How long has he been gone? \nPAULINE I don't know. Ingrid brought him in last night, but we couldn't find him this morning. \nMARGOT Oh boy. \nPAULINE Did you tell Claude I'm pregnant? \nMARGOT I don't know. \nPAULINE You did. \nMARGOT I guess I said something. \nPAULINE You did. You don't have to tell him everything. \nMARGOT He wants to know. If I don't tell him, he figures it out. \nINGRID (O.S.) Where is Wizard? Ingrid approaches with Claude. PAULINE I don't know, honey. Ingrid sinks into her mother's body.   Claude and Margot walk ahead. \nCLAUDE You didn't let him go out into the road or something where something could've happened to him? \nMARGOT Why would you think I'd do something like that? That's awful. \nCLAUDE I just...    I'm just making sure. \nMARGOT That's a terrible thing to say to me. \nCLAUDE I didn't mean on purpose, I just meant maybe in case...you knew something. I'm sorry. \n45   INT. KITCHEN - DAY                                         45 \nMargot enters and opens the refrigerator. She gets out a white wine bottle. She turns around and jumps, startled. \nMARGOT Woa! \nMalcolm sits at the table, eating saltines out of the box, a pad and paper in front of him. \nMALCOLM Hey, sorry. I'm here. \nMARGOT No, I...    I should've looked. \nMALCOLM I'm just writing my vows. Trying to do something appropriate but also funny -- not jokey, more character based humor. Margot pours herself a glass of wine. She looks to Malcolm to see if he wants some. He shakes his head. She takes a long drink. Silence. MALCOLM You having an okay time? MARGOT Oh, yeah.    Besides Wizard getting -- \nMALCOLM Yeah, we'll...we'll find him...or else, I don't know... \nMARGOT We won't. \nShe waits for Malcolm to jump in.    He doesn't.   Vogler says softly, but sternly: \nVOGLER The roots are growing into our property. It's rotting, it's killing our plants. \nPAULINE We had a tree doctor out and he said it was healthy. \nPauline smacks Malcolm's arm. \nPAULINE Would it hurt you to say anything? \nMALCOLM What?   What do you want from me? \nPAULINE You're making me do the whole fucking thing. \nMALCOLM You brought up the tree. \nPAULINE He brought up -- \nShe stops herself.   She says to Vogler: PAULINE I'm sorry... This was better thought-through back at the house. Pauline's gaze goes above Vogler's head -- like Margot described earlier. He runs his hand through his hair as if something might be caught in there. PAULINE We were wondering if you and your wife -- I'm sorry I forgot her name -- would like to come over for... \nVOGLER You should ask her. She makes the plans. I'm going to go in now. \nHe tramps inside.   The screen door bangs. \nMALCOLM I felt like you didn't give me a chance to say what I wanted to say. \nPauline hits him in the chest and starts to walk away. Malcolm comes after her, his rage growing. \nMALCOLM I want to punch that guy in the nose! \nPAULINE You've never hit anyone. \nMALCOLM I have too! \nPAULINE Who? \nMALCOLM Lots of -- You don't know them. They're not around because I've punched them. \nA smile breaks across Pauline's face.   Malcolm seethes. \nMALCOLM Don't laugh, Pauline. It's not funny. I'll fucking punch your sister. \nMalcolm clenches his fists.    He points at Vogler's place. MALCOLM The threat is not out there. It's in our house. It's sleeping in my studio. I mean, I wouldn't actually hit her, but I feel...I feel like doing it. She's such a fucking idiot. PAULINE She's not an idiot.    You might not like her -- \nMALCOLM She is. She is an idiot!    You're an idiot. \nPAULINE Jesus. \nMALCOLM You're both fucking morons. I'm so fucking... I'm trying so hard. You don't give me any credit. \nPAULINE What is wrong? \nMALCOLM I don't know, I have the emotional version of whatever bad feng shui would be. I don't know. You tell me, you understand this shit. \nPAULINE Did you drink your teas? \nMALCOLM Yeah, I drank my fucking teas! Don't judge me now. Really, I think when you look back at this you're going to see I'm not acting like a crazy person. That this is the right reaction. In proportion with what is going on. This is right! \nMalcolm looks around furiously. The only thing available to him is a leafy stalk. He pulls on it, but it won't uproot. He tears the leaves off in a rage. \nPAULINE You have the most oddly self- conscious form of rage I've ever -- \nMALCOLM I hate you. Exhausted he approaches her.   He says, still with anger: MALCOLM Let's make love. \nMARGOT I get self-conscious opening presents in front of people.    This weekend is about Pauline. \nPAULINE Oh...poo.     Open it Margot. \nMargot slowly unties the white ribbon and peels away the tape. Pauline groans: \nPAULINE Come on, get to it. \nMargot takes out a pair of furry slippers. \nMALCOLM Those look warm. JIM I remember last year in Vermont you said your feet were freezing. Her eyes find Claude who watches his parents carefully. She leans across the table to Jim and they kiss chastely and briskly on the lips. \nMARGOT Thank you. \n49   INT. JIM'S CAR - NIGHT                                      49 \nJim drives with Margot in the passenger seat. \nMARGOT I already have slippers. \nJIM Well, that's okay.   Two sets are fine, right? \nMARGOT It makes me sad to get a present that I already have. \nJIM Why? \nMARGOT It makes me feel like you don't know me. \nShe jams her pinky into her ear trying to get at the bug. \nJIM What's wrong with your ear? \nMARGOT I asked you not to come. I was so clear and you did it anyway so blithely. \nJIM We need time alone to sort this out. You can't just run away -- \nMARGOT Okay, so we're here.   I'm giving you this time. JIM (trying a joke) Well, now you're putting too much pressure on me. Jim smiles crookedly at her. She half-smiles back.   He takes a moment, preparing to speak. Then: JIM What is that? His headlights catch a woman cowering at the roadside. They pass. \nMARGOT Keep driving. \nJim slowly pulls over to the shoulder. \nMARGOT No...no...no. Jim, no. \nJIM Let me just... \nJim gets out of the car.     A sobbing woman crouches, cradling a bloody dog. \nWOMAN Please help me. \nJim comes toward her. \nWOMAN Please help me. He got hit by a car. Please help me. \nMargot opens her door and steps out. \nMARGOT (warily) Jim... \nJim kneels down by the whining pit bull.    The woman screams: \nWOMAN Help me! \nMARGOT Careful, he might bite you! \nMARGOT (suddenly) Paul, what are you doing getting married to this guy? He's not good enough for you. He's so coarse, he's like guys we rejected when we were sixteen. You know...don't make a mistake like this. (pause) I'm sorry, maybe I have no right to say that, but you know I'm truthful so... Would you rather I lie? \nPAULINE Who should I be with then? \nA smashing sound. Margot steps outside: Two hooded figures turn over a recycling can, glass smashes on the ground. Garbage is strewn across the driveway. \nMARGOT (O.S.) Hey! Hey, you! You pick that up. I will call the police. This is our property. Pick that up. \nPauline remains seated at the table, stunned.    Margot comes back inside. \nMARGOT Creeps. \n53   EXT. DRIVEWAY - MORNING                                     53 \nMalcolm crams the trash back in the cans. He sees something amidst the milk cartons and corn husks. He reaches down and lifts up a severed pig's hoof. \n54   EXT. FIELD - MORNING                                        54 \nClaude and Ingrid idle in the tall grass calling to Wizard. \nCLAUDE Dogs usually come back, I think. \nINGRID What happened to your dad? \nCLAUDE He went to Vermont. \nINGRID He didn't want to come to the wedding? \nCLAUDE I don't think he could...    I think he couldn't. (pause) You want to see me dance? INGRID Okay. Claude dances. The gangly weeds blow around him. There's a rustling in the brush. A patch of fur catches Ingrid's eye. INGRID (under her breath) Wizard... \nThe animal is gone. \nA figure appears in the distance behind Claude. The boy, the Vogler's son, approaches shirtless in swimming trunks. Ingrid's attention goes to him. \nCLAUDE You're not watching. \nThe boy comes into focus. He holds a dead squirrel by its tail. Ingrid backs up next to Claude. The boy stops a few feet away and hurls the squirrel at them. The kids jump back as it lands at their feet. \nBOY Where are you going? \nCLAUDE (stopping) We have to get home. \nBOY Is that your girlfriend? \nCLAUDE No, she's my cousin. \nBOY You a fruity? \nCLAUDE Um...no. \nBOY (to Ingrid) You a fruity? \nINGRID (with certainty) No. BOY We will hurt you. Claude takes Ingrid's arm and they start to walk away. INGRID He's a Vogler. \nCLAUDE He's just a stupid boy. \nClaude sneaks a look over his shoulder -- the boy follows. Claude's gait quickens. \nINGRID Hold it, I have a rock in my sandal. \nCLAUDE Come on, Ingrid. \nIngrid slows, lifts her leg and removes a sandal. The boy is behind them. Claude yanks Ingrid's arm and she topples over. \nMARGOT (nods) I told him to go to Vermont without me. \nDICK I'd love to see him tell a linear story for a change. Jim never wanted to make it easy for the reader, did he. The nicest man I've ever met, but he can't play the game. MARGOT I'm not joining him. I'm going to stay here and then...we'll see. Right. Okay? DICK I didn't ask you to do that. (pause) The guy's pointing at us... \n58   CUT TO:                                                     58 \nMargot and Dick sit on stools holding microphones in front of rows of fold-out chairs. Only a few empty seats remain. Pauline and Claude sit in the back. \nDICK I'm very interested in your story \"Middle Children.\" \nSome people applaud, but it trickles off before it gets started. \nDICK The father is a loathsome character yet we also feel a strange sympathy for him. \nMARGOT Yeah, well I was very interested in exploring a father-daughter relationship. While he clings desperately to her, suffocates her really, he also silently resents the responsibility of parenthood. \nDICK There's this sexualized push-pull with Daphne which I find -- \nMARGOT He craves isolation really. I always thought of him as someone who so over identifies with everyone around him that he begins to lose all sense of himself. \nDICK You make his only recourse to abandon his family, including his beloved daughter. \nMARGOT Right, that's true.   That's true. DICK I write historical fiction so I don't have to answer to this, but I wonder for someone who writes so nakedly about family, how autobiographical is this portrait? \nMargot rests her lips on the tip of the microphone. \nMARGOT My father was a loving person. He had his days, of course, but...he was devoted to us as children. I wouldn't have written this portrait were it true. \nPauline nods slightly. \nDICK But I'm interested in how the father could be in fact a portrait of you. Margot stares, dumbstruck. \nMARGOT Umm...I don't... Why do you assume it's based on... We all take from life. I had to have our refrigerator repaired the other day at our apartment in Manhattan. I was alone with a guy, I think he was Puerto Rican, sent over by...Whirlpool, I think it is who made our fridge. Although he said he worked for an independent organization who Whirlpool subcontracts. I think he was retarded. There was an anger in him and suddenly I became afraid for my life. I called Jim at NYU. I asked him to come home. \nMargot stops.   Her face is awash in sweat. \nPauline takes Claude's hand and presses it to her chest.    His eyes widen, fixed on his mother. \nMARGOT It might be Frigidaire... I'm sorry... I don't... I'm not sure what I'm... I think I need to take a moment... \nShe stands and walks off the stage. She realizes she still has the mike. She goes back and places it on her seat. MARGOT (almost incoherently) You're an asshole... \n59   INT. BOOKSTORE BATHROOM - MOMENTS LATER                      59 \nMargot grabs a pill from her pocket, puts it on her tongue and drinks from the faucet. There is a knocking. Margot opens the door. Claude looks up at her. Pauline and Dick wait in the background. \nMARGOT I need to be alone right now, okay? \nCLAUDE What's wrong? \nMARGOT I don't know. I'll tell you sometime. Go on. \nCLAUDE Are you sure? \nMARGOT Yes. Go with mom.    I'll see you later. \nCLAUDE You said, mom. \nMARGOT (snapping) But you know what I mean. Go with Pauline. Jesus, do I...do I need to spell it out for you? (she points) Go. With. Her. \n60   INT. CHURCH - DAY                                            60 \nA simple, spare space, empty except for Pauline and Claude. \nMARGOT It is true. You're never helpful. I wish I had taught you better manners. \nCLAUDE I can try to make popovers.   If I can remember how. \nMARGOT Don't bother. She looks at him with grave disappointment. CLAUDE Why are you looking at me like that? \nMARGOT I just see how much you've changed. Your body language. You used to be rounder and more graceful. You're so stiff now. So blase. \nCLAUDE What do you mean? \nMARGOT (retreating) I can't explain it. \nMargot shakes her head.   She's suddenly distraught. \nMARGOT It's okay though. \nCLAUDE Uh huh. \nClaude looks devastated. He starts toward the beach. Margot's eyes well up -- she says, trying to make things better: \nMARGOT You're still handsome. \n62   EXT. HOUSE - SAME                                             62 \nPauline marches toward Malcolm.    Malcolm wears the safety goggles and revs the chainsaw. \nPAULINE Are you able to do this yourself? \nMALCOLM Pauline, do you want me to cut it down or not? PAULINE Watch the tent. The jagged blades pierce the trunk.   Pauline crunches her face. Malcolm stops suddenly. He walks around the tree and inspects the bark. MALCOLM (indicating his fleece) I liked how it looked on Vogler. Pauline starts to say something -- stops.    Then: \nPAULINE I think it's over between Dick and Margot. He was so cruel to her today. And poor Claude had to watch it all. She should just get out of the marriage and then she can fuck whoever she wants, you know. It's cowardly. And Dick Koosman. What a choice. I mean...you know? \nMALCOLM I agree. I hate the idea of Dick fucking Margot. \nPAULINE What does that mean?   You want to fuck Margot? \nMALCOLM Pauline, that's not what I said. \nPAULINE I know you have a crush on her, you already told me that. \nMalcolm reddens and starts the chainsaw again.   They yell over the noise: \nMALCOLM I didn't say that. I said I thought she was attractive after you grilled me. She has no interest in me anyway. Not that it would matter if she did. \nPAULINE Have you ever done anything like that. MALCOLM What do you mean? PAULINE Have you ever cheated on me? MALCOLM No! Malcolm shuts the motor. MALCOLM Can I do this? \nPAULINE Those emails you had with that student of mine. \nMALCOLM (exhales) Uh huh. \nPAULINE Did that...I know you said it was nothing. \nMALCOLM It was. \nPAULINE I just...     Can you say it again? \nMALCOLM I just did. Now, can I cut down the tree? \nPAULINE You never did anything with her? \nMALCOLM No. She emailed me after we met at that reading at the college and... You know we were friends. \nPAULINE Right, just a regular friendship between you and a twenty year old girl. \nThe deafening shriek of the blade as it cuts into the tree. Malcolm is soaked in sweat. Ingrid watches from a few feet away. \nIn the distance -- Dick's orange BMW grinds into the driveway. Maisy hurries toward him. \nIngrid says, buried in the noise: \nINGRID There's Dick. \nMalcolm sees Dick.   He pushes the blade harder into the wood. \nINGRID Is it almost ready? MALCOLM (distracted) Almost. Maisy is talking to her father. Dick spots Malcolm. He immediately starts toward him. Malcolm hesitates. Cold fear creeps up his neck. \nDick speeds up. Malcolm backs up slowly -- drops the chainsaw -- and bolts toward the water. Ingrid watches, confused. \nDick takes off after him. Malcolm stumbles down the long wooden stairs to the beach. \nMalcolm runs wobbily -- he pants, already out of breath. Sweat pours down his face and body. \nDick's gait is swift -- his arms stiff, bent at the elbow. His jeans make a swish swish. He takes the stairs two at a time. \nMalcolm grasps the railing, moving as fast as he can sideways, trying not to fall. He reaches the beach, his feet sinking in the sand. He trips and topples forward. \nHe looks up -- Dick lunges. \nDick pounds Malcolm's head and face.     Malcolm throws his arms up and tries to block the punches. \nMALCOLM I didn't do anything!    I didn't do anything! \nDICK Fucking sleazebag! \nDick gets up.   He kicks Malcolm hard. \nDICK I don't ever want to see you again. \nMalcolm balls himself up against a rock.    He cries: \nMALCOLM Fuck off, dickhead. \nDick marches forward and kicks Malcolm again hard. \nMALCOLM Ow! Dick lights a brown cigarette and walks away.    Malcolm screams: MALCOLM Fucking dickbag! She's lying! He touches his face and sees the blood on his fingers. MALCOLM (choking on tears) Oh, man. \nThere's a rustling noise in the wind. Malcolm looks -- a mud- and sea-coated Wizard watches him with a panting smile. \n66   CUT TO:                                                     66 \nWheels sputter in the gravel. Dick's car peels out with Maisy in the passenger seat. Claude and Margot watch from the porch. \n67   INT. LIVING ROOM/DINING ROOM - SAME                         67 \nPauline is seated at the table with place cards, flowers, silverware, napkins, dishes. Margot enters. Claude follows. \nMARGOT Come with me to New York. \nPAULINE I can't talk about it -- \nMARGOT Okay, but you can't marry him. You have to go now. We can think about what to do with the baby -- \nPAULINE (stands) Margot, I can't -- \nMARGOT Don't turn vague, listen to me -- \nPAULINE I want you to pack all your things and get out of here. You can take our car and leave it at the ferry. \nThe speedometer needle wavers around 30. Margot clutches the steering wheel. Claude looks morose. Pauline and Ingrid sit stonily in the back seat. The Volvo jerks into the oncoming lane and back. Margot draws a deep breath. \nCLAUDE I thought you couldn't drive. \nMARGOT (irritated) I can drive. Why does everyone say that? I used to drive. \nThey inch up a small hill. A car cascades down past them. The Volvo shakes. Pauline suddenly snaps out of her daze: \nPAULINE We have to call people and cancel. \nINGRID What happened? Can I still sing? \nMargot rolls down the window. \nMARGOT (to Claude) You do smell. \nCLAUDE Well, I'm not wearing any deodorant. They reach the top of the hill, over the crest, and descend. The vehicle picks up speed. Margot presses down on the brake. MARGOT Shit. \nCLAUDE What? \nMARGOT I don't think... (she pumps again) No... We don't have brakes. \nPAULINE (resigned) The brakes are bad, that's right. \nCLAUDE What does that mean? \nMARGOT What do you think it means? \nCLAUDE I mean, what can we do? \nThe car coasts faster down the hill. \nCLAUDE Mom. \nMargot places her arm stiffly across Claude's front. \nPauline wraps her body around her daughter. \nMargot swerves into the shoulder -- she makes a sharp turn into the forest and crashes through the bramble and muck. The car slows until it comes to a sudden stop at the base of a tree. \n70   CUT TO:                                                   70 \nMargot and Claude, Pauline and Ingrid trudge through the bony white trees of the forest -- their bags weigh them down. They're all covered in sweat and there's dirt caked on their feet and ankles. \nMARGOT I ruined these shoes. Pauline's face screws up. She's suddenly in pain.   She races behind a tree. Margot follows. INGRID Mom, are you okay? PAULINE (O.S.) Don't look! \nMargot stops. \nPAULINE (O.S.) Shit! \nINGRID Mom, what happened? \nPAULINE (O.S.) Nothing. \nMargot steps to see around the trunk. The kids follow behind. Pauline removes her panties from under her skirt. She tosses them in the brush. \nPAULINE Fuck. Margot turns to the kids.   Ingrid hides a smile. \nCLAUDE Did she poop in her pants? \nMARGOT It happens to everyone. Not just babies. It'll happen to you too someday. \n71   EXT. FERRY - DAY                                            71 \nMARGOT Nothing. Just then I felt so much love for you. \n75   CUT TO:                                                    75 \nPauline tucks in Ingrid who lies next to Claude. Margot sits on the other bed scribbling in her brown notebook. Pauline marches around and across to the other side of the room. She snatches the book out of Margot's hands. \nMARGOT Hey! \nPAULINE You cannot write about this.   You can't have it. MARGOT I wasn't writing about you. PAULINE You already took a part of my life, you can't have any more. And that goes for Ingrid and Malcolm and Wizard. We all own our own rights. They're not for sale. MARGOT Give it back. \nPauline glances at the book. \nPAULINE If I could read your handwriting I'm sure I'd be furious. But if I ever see a story that involves a hotel room or any of this shit, I will fucking take your bowels out. \nPauline thrusts the book back at Margot -- \nCUT TO: \nThe kids sleep in one bed.    Margot and Pauline lie awake in the other. \nPAULINE You've now successfully ruined two of my marriages. \nMARGOT You're not wearing any underwear. \nPAULINE It's hot, I'm pregnant.    Move over. Jesus. \nMARGOT You're not hot, your feet are cold. \nPAULINE Stop touching me. I am so hot. Feel my head. \nMargot puts her lips to Pauline's forehead. \nMARGOT You have a fever. \nPAULINE I don't have a fever... I'm pregnant...are you always like this? MARGOT Get used to it... Mom and Becky share a bed -- you and I will probably get the other. \nPAULINE You should just go to Vermont. \nMARGOT I was thinking -- you know if you want -- you and Ingrid could go to Vermont. Keep Claude company and Jim adores you. \nPAULINE You don't like Malcolm because you're not attracted to him. \nMARGOT Will you do it? \nPAULINE No. I won't do that for you. \nMARGOT (pause) Did you two talk about me in town? What did you say? \nPAULINE (pause) I told him you often change your mind. \n76   INT. BAR/RESTAURANT - MORNING                            76 \nCheap plastic tables. A small karaoke stage in front. Margot, Claude, Pauline and Ingrid sit at the bar. Margot drinks her wine with ice. She wears Jim's sweater. The kids have Cokes. The remains of ketchup-soaked french fries in a plastic red basket lie between them. \nA man with a mullet climbs up on the karaoke stage. The music begins. The man sways and sings \"On and On\" by Stephen Bishop. He croons sweetly and beautifully. Claude's eyes moisten. Margot swallows a blue pill and chases it with the wine. She takes her son's hand and whispers: MARGOT I'm sorry, sweety. There's something wrong with me. PAULINE I'm going to call him. Margot quickly turns to her sister. MARGOT No.   Don't. I'm telling you. \nPAULINE I...I need some clothes and things. \nMARGOT He should get the hell out of our house. \nPAULINE Okay. I'll tell him to get the hell out of our house. \nPauline walks over to a pay phone. \nMargot takes Claude's arm and walks quickly in the opposite direction. Claude, confused, glances over his shoulder. MARGOT Don't look. Keep walking. CLAUDE Why are we -- MARGOT We have to get you to your bus. \n80   CUT TO:                                                   80 \nA huge parking lot. A bus in the distance.   Claude tries to keep pace with his mother. \nCLAUDE Did you do something? \nMARGOT What do you mean, do something? \nCLAUDE I mean, why is the wedding not happening? Is there something that you did? \nMARGOT Pauline has transferred all her stuff onto me. I don't understand her anymore. Why'd she pick this man? It is really berserk. And you know, she referred to me as her closest friend. We never see one anoth -- \nAn unfamiliar sound comes out of Margot. The sadness is unexpected -- she sobs uncontrollably. She tries to speak: \nMARGOT I mean we're not close.   Even if we want to be. You know? \nCLAUDE But was there anything real? \nMARGOT No! How many times do I have to say it? Jesus. You think so little of me. (through her sobs) It's good you're going. You shouldn't be around me either. I'd go if I were you... CLAUDE Will you find Pauline and Nana after I leave? MARGOT (half-serious) I don't know. Maybe I'll go to church. \nMargot is sweating. She wipes her brow with her sleeve. She periodically looks behind her. Nobody seems to be following. \nCLAUDE (growing nervous) Are you angry at me? \nMARGOT No, honey.     I'm not mad at you. \nCLAUDE I don't want to go with you mad at anyone. \nMARGOT Everything's fine.    I'm not mad at anyone. \nUp ahead is a tiny depot.    People climb onto a white bus. \nCLAUDE Can you come with me? \nMARGOT No, you know that. (pause) We should talk about the next few months a little bit and what's going to happen -- \nCLAUDE I don't like Vermont. \nMARGOT Your dad will be very happy to see you. And I'm sure Josh is dying to hang out. \nCLAUDE Please come, mom. MARGOT (suddenly irritable) Claude, stop it. Okay? She watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man. Margot closes her eyes. She breathes deeply. MARGOT You used to need me to watch you when you played. \nCLAUDE What do you mean? \nMARGOT (vaguely) When you first started to play with friends, you wouldn't do it unless I watched you. You were afraid I would go out the back door. I don't know where I would go. Our yard didn't lead anywhere anyway. \nShe takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow T- shirt. She isn't wearing a bra. Claude says suddenly: \nCLAUDE I masturbated last night. While everyone was asleep I went into the bathroom and did it. \nMARGOT You don't have to tell me, sweety. \nThe bus driver slams the luggage compartment closed. \nMARGOT You've got to go. \nMargot ties her sweater around her waist and takes Claude's hand. They approach the bus. Claude's body tenses. \nCLAUDE How will you get home? \nMARGOT I don't know. I'll see. Maybe Dick can drive me to the... (pause) Jesus, I lost the word for a second. The train. CLAUDE Uh huh. He looks at her longingly. MARGOT Come on. You always don't want to leave me and you always have a good time once you do. (provocatively) I think you like getting away from me. \n", "test1_input": "MARGOT AT THE WEDDING \nWritten by \nNoah Baumbach \n1   INT. TRAIN CAR - DAY                                          1 \nA cashier hands a boy, 13, his change across a counter. The boy stuffs the coins in his pocket. He lifts the cardboard tray with two hot dogs, a bag of chips, and two Cokes. This is Claude. \nWe follow him: He carefully carries the meal down the aisle, balances it in one hand as he opens the door. \nThe train noise blares as he traverses the area between cars. \nHe enters the new car repeating the balancing act. He waits while a man shoves his back-pack onto the metal rack above the seats. Claude hurries a bit more now, his concentration alternating between the food and the path. \nHe sits next to a brunette woman.   He hands her a hot dog. \nCLAUDE Here. \nHe's met by a severe and pinched face. The eyes have black circles -- there is a scar above her lip. Claude instantly blushes and mumbles: \nCLAUDE Sorry. \nHe gets up and hurries a few seats further. He slides next to a pretty brunette woman, late 30's, with straight shoulder length hair. Her name is Margot. \nMARGOT That was quick. \nCLAUDE I sat next to the wrong person. \nMARGOT Really?   Where? She stretches up and peers over the seats.   He grabs her shirt. CLAUDE Please don't look.    She'll see you. MARGOT Careful with my blouse. \n2   CUT TO:                                                       2 \nMargot is sleeping, her head against the window. Claude listens to his iPod. He takes out the earphones, gets up, and walks to the front of the car. Opens the door and goes between cars. \nThe train roars and screeches. Claude screams.   He stops, looks around. He screams again. \n3   CUT TO:                                                       3 \nClaude and his mother gaze out the dirt streaked window at a river. An old castle-like structure emerges from the water. \nHouses are run-down. In the distance there's a power plant. Electrical lines crisscross the sky. Claude puts his finger against the glass and traces the wires. \nCLAUDE Will the wedding be crowded? \nMARGOT I don't know. I think she doesn't know anyone anymore. \nCLAUDE How long has she known Malcolm? \nMARGOT Only a year. \nCLAUDE Is that short? \nMARGOT (pointedly) Would you marry someone you'd only known a year? CLAUDE I'm not going to ever get married. MARGOT I can't say I have a lot of hope for the whole thing. CLAUDE Why are we going then? \nMARGOT We're supporting her. \nCLAUDE I thought she wasn't speaking to you. \nMARGOT No...no...I wasn't speaking to her, but I'm over it. \n4   EXT.

People get out of their cars and stretch their legs. \nClaude leans against the rail and lets the spray hit his face. Margot's cell vibrates. The caller ID: HOME. She stuffs the phone in her pocket. \nMARGOT Why aren't you wearing your new shades? \nCLAUDE I don't think I need them right now. \nMARGOT You begged for those glasses. \nCLAUDE I know, but...I will wear them, I just feel like people might think it's weird that a kid is wearing dark shades. MARGOT That's ridiculous. Claude reluctantly takes out a pair of thin wrap-around punk sunglasses and puts them on. He looks around self- consciously. MARGOT You look very cool. He takes them off. \nCLAUDE I don't need them right now. \n6   CUT TO:                                                       6 \nMargot and Claude wait.   The ferry has emptied out. \nCLAUDE Do they know we're here? \nA maroon Volvo station wagon peels around a bend and stops across the road. Two eyes peer out from just below the backseat window. A man, 40, in dumpy cargo shorts rolls down the window. He has a small moustache -- he's harried and sweaty. This is Malcolm. He points at Margot and Claude. \nMALCOLM Are you...? \n7   INT. VOLVO - DAY                                              7 \nMalcolm drives. He smokes with the window open. Margot is in the passenger seat. In the back, Claude and the girl, Ingrid, sit shyly, their hair blows turbulently in the wind. Ingrid, 11, wears shorts, sandals, and a batik shirt with a panda on it. \nMALCOLM Paul apologizes for not coming, she's still getting the house ready. \nMARGOT I'm sorry it was such short notice. \nMALCOLM I don't care. Paul's frantic, but I don't give a shit. Oh, and Ingrid wants me to tell you that she made us all bracelets. INGRID (embarrassed) No, I wanted...I wanted to wait... MALCOLM Oh, I thought you asked me to tell them. Anyway... \nMalcolm holds up his wrist and shows a knit blue and orange bracelet. \nMALCOLM I got Knicks colors. \nINGRID They're not Knicks colors! \nMARGOT It's beautiful, Ingrid. \nINGRID (to Claude) I made this one for myself. \nShe shows him the purple and green one around her wrist. \nINGRID Yours is yellow. Is that okay? \nCLAUDE I guess. \nINGRID Where's your dad and Josh? \nCLAUDE They might come later. \nMARGOT Josh's spring break is next week. Jim teaches through Friday and then they open the house in Vermont on the weekend. \nMALCOLM (bluntly) It means a lot to Pauline that you're here. \nMargot nods awkwardly -- she blushes. MARGOT Oh.     Good. A car suddenly pulls out of a driveway, but nowhere near their car. Malcolm swerves anyway. MALCOLM Holy Jesus! Watch it, dicksack! Ingrid giggles.    Margot clutches the handle above the door. \nMALCOLM If you're wondering about the moustache -- \n", "test2_input": "MARGOT No, I wasn't. \nMALCOLM I had a full beard   for a while and then when I shaved   it I left this part for last, you   know to see how it looked, and...

The Volvo is parked in a driveway alongside a grey Colonial house that sits above the water. They lift bags. An old mutt ambles toward them. \nPauline emerges from the house. She's pretty like her sister, late 30's. She walks briskly toward them. Margot smiles and opens her arms, but Pauline passes her and dips down to embrace Claude. She kisses him on the lips. \nPAULINE You're so handsome. \nNow she hugs Margot.    They both tear up.   Claude beams. \nPAULINE I never thought I'd get you here. \nA loud thud. They all turn toward the property fence. A large pile of dead flowers and rotting plants has been dumped into their yard. There's whispering and movement through brush on the other side. Margot looks at Pauline with concern. PAULINE You're arriving in the midst of a drama. Ingrid, make sure Wizard is inside. Malcolm trudges over to the trash cans. INGRID It's the Voglers. \nPAULINE The neighbors want us to cut down our tree. \nShe indicates a large oak that extends up and into the adjoining property. \nMARGOT No, that's our tree! \nINGRID They think it's sick and rotting their property. \nPAULINE We're having the ceremony under it. \nMARGOT You took the swing down. \nMALCOLM Pauline thinks this is their way of trying to be friends. I think they resent us because we're... \nHe searches for the word, but can't come up with anything. He says wearily: \nMALCOLM I don't know what we are. \n9   INT. CLAUDE'S GUEST ROOM/INGRID'S ROOM - DAY                     9 \nClaude sits on the squeaky bed, a yellow bracelet on his wrist. An old flip-clock hums on the night-table. A door opens onto a bathroom which has another door open onto another bedroom. \nIngrid sits on her bed observing Claude. She holds a realistic-looking stuffed rooster in an old-style tuxedo. INGRID This is my room. CLAUDE Okay. INGRID Do you like showers or baths? \nCLAUDE Showers.   What about you? \nIngrid shrugs.   She says, already bored with the topic: \nINGRID I don't care. \n10   INT. STAIRWELL/MARGOT'S GUEST ROOM - DAY                    10 \nPauline and Margot carry bags up the stairs. Margot now wears a knit red bracelet. They're tentative with one another. \nPAULINE Is Malcolm what you thought he'd be? \nMARGOT Well, I didn't know what to -- \nPAULINE The moustache is temporary. He left it for last when he was shaving. It's meant to be funny. \nMARGOT He told me. \nPAULINE Yeah... \n", "test2_true": "PAULINE I'm sorry -- with so little time to prepare, we had to put you in Malcolm's storage room -- \nMARGOT This was Becky's room.   Poor Becky. PAULINE Yeah, poor Becky. Now it's a storage room. I've just started to feel like it's our house not my parents. You know? MARGOT Our parents. \nPAULINE Of course. It might still smell like paint, but... \nMARGOT I thought he was a musician. \nPauline jimmies down the stiff windows. Margot begins to unpack and hang up clothes in the closet. \nPAULINE Well, music's officially a hobby... He's painting now. And writing letters to newspapers and magazines. He's very meticulous, he'll spend up to a week writing a response to a music review. He's incredibly smart. Maybe too smart. I don't know. We're doing very well. \nMARGOT Good.    I mean, you must be. \nSilence. \nPAULINE I don't know where to begin. What can I tell you? It seems I'm pregnant, but it's really early so... I haven't told anyone. I mean, I haven't told Malcolm or Ingrid. \nMARGOT Wow... \nPAULINE Yeah, if it sticks. We'll see. I hope so. Things are good. We did a couples seminar two months ago or so in Maine. They give you exercises and things to do. I know you're not convinced, but... MARGOT (vaguely) Mm hm. PAULINE We got engaged right afterwards. The guy who runs it, Strickland, wrote a really interesting book about loving which I'll lend you if you want. \nMARGOT (non-committal) Okay. \nPAULINE But only if you'll read it. Because I need it back. I made notes in the margins. \nMARGOT I may not get to it for a while. \nPAULINE Well, I'm not going to lend it to you if you're not going to read it. \nThey meet eyes.   Pauline quickly turns away. \nPAULINE It's going to be very informal by the way. Just Mom and Becky. Malcolm's brother. Few friends. And now you and Claude. Nothing like the first one. \nMARGOT (wary) Becky's coming? \nPAULINE/MARGOT She isn't how you.../I'd really like... \nPAULINE You go. \nMARGOT I was going to say, \"I'd really like some white wine.\" PAULINE Oh. Yeah. We have a... Well...I'm glad you changed your mind and came. I never heard from you after I sent the invite...I even wondered if you got it. MARGOT (quickly) Well, I'm so pleased we're here. PAULINE Did you get it? \nMARGOT Yeah. \nPauline waits for an explanation. \nMARGOT I'm sorry you were so angry... \nPAULINE I wasn't angry. I was...disappointed. \nMARGOT Uh huh. But you see when you say, \"disappointed\" it puts me in a crummy situation. Like I let you down. \nPAULINE But you did in a way. \nMARGOT I don't see it like that. \nPAULINE Fine. I felt betrayed.    Is that word okay? \nMARGOT Again, you're making me the aggressor. \nPAULINE You were the aggressor. (pause) Let's not... I've become a really good cook. 11   INT. LIVING ROOM - LATE DAY                                 11 Malcolm strums his guitar and smokes. Pauline sits at his feet with Ingrid and Claude. The kids look at a record sleeve. Margot is curled up on the sofa writing in a little brown notebook. She wears oval tortoise-shell glasses. \nMARGOT I can't believe you've still got all of our old records. Ingrid pulls an album toward her. Her eyes widen at the scary image on the cover. She quickly turns it over and hands it to her mother. \n", "test3_input": "MARGOT You didn't see it. I saw it. You've got a problem. \nPAULINE I'm not worried. (pause) We could teach Claude how to swim. \nMARGOT He won't want to do it.   It's too late. \nPauline waits for more -- nothing comes. She takes a couple steps into the room. She holds out her hand for the glass. Margot passes it to her. Pauline sips. \nMARGOT Are you supposed to be doing that? \nPAULINE No. \nShe hands it back. \nPAULINE I liked your last story in, was it Harpers? The one about mom. I was very...I liked it very much. \nMARGOT It wasn't really about mom. \nPAULINE I thought it was. Anyway. Why don't you want Claude to know how to swim? MARGOT I didn't say I didn't want him to. Why do you care? It's not in his life -- we're New Yorkers. If he wants to learn when he's older, he can. I'm curious why you're so interested in the whole thing. PAULINE I'm not. I'm just... As a safety thing and...I'm... Forget it. (pause) (MORE) \nPAULINE (CONT'D) It's interesting -- this is the first time Dick has invited us over. \nMARGOT But are you really friends? \nPAULINE Kind of. We're neighbors. We employ Maisy. I mean I don't care, I just think it's interesting. (pause) Are you excited about the talk? I thought I'd come if that's okay. My friend, Agnes, asked me, \"What's it like to have a celebrity as a sister?\" I said, I've got no problem with celebrity. Alice Munro taught at Bennington and was kind of a friend of mine. \nMARGOT I'm not a celebrity. \nPAULINE Well, you're well known. \nMARGOT To a very few people. \nPAULINE Just accept the compliment. \nMARGOT I guess I didn't realize it was a compliment. \n31   EXT. FOREST - LATE DAY                                     31 \nMargot walks the path alone. She hugs herself as a light breeze kicks up. Her footsteps echo in the trees. The little pink sneaker still lies in the dirt. She crouches down and takes it. 32   CUT TO:                                                    32 CLOSE: A note is being written. \n\"...and if you are acting with any sort of abuse toward your child I will call the police.\" \nThe word \"any\" is then underlined twice.   The page is torn from her little brown book. \n33   EXT. VOGLER HOUSE - EVENING                                   33 \nMargot's fist is raised about to knock on the front door. She stops herself. She puts the note on the Welcome mat and holds it in place with the child's shoe. She wanders around to the back of the house. She looks into a lighted window: \nIt's a white tiled bathroom. \nA wet brown animal body covered in clear plastic is balanced on the sink. Mr. Vogler tears into the plastic. The carcass is butterflied open exposing the innards and ribs. \nMrs. Vogler runs the tub. She pours salt from a box in the water. The man slides his hand in her waist-band. She rubs against him. \nMargot chews her cuticle. \nThe man saws the legs. His arm jerks back and forth, straining to cut through the bone. Sweat pours down his temples. \nMargot raises her hand to her face and presses against the window. She peers through her fingers. The blade pierces the bone with a violent release and the hoof falls to the floor. \nMargot moves to another window.   The pig's face now looks at her. \nBlood drips and leaks into the crevices of the tile. The woman brandishes a syringe filled with an orange liquid. \n", "test3_true": "Maisy appears in the doorway and watches.   Claude turns mid- lyric. He jumps, startled. \nMAISY Singing? \nFumbling, Claude shuts off the tape recorder. \nCLAUDE Hm?     A bit. \nShe drifts into the room and hovers closely above Claude who remains on the bed. \nMargot passes by in the hallway, disheveled from her escape. She watches: Maisy takes the lyric sleeve from Claude's hands. Her T-shirt hangs above her waist showing her smooth stomach. \nMAISY Can I make a suggestion? \nCLAUDE Uh huh. \nMAISY You should get underarm deodorant. \nCLAUDE Uh huh. \nMAISY You kind of smell. \nClaude blushes. \nMAISY Better I tell you than someone else. 35   INT. MARGOT'S BATHROOM - EVENING                           35 \nMargot puts on mascara and watches Claude, who stands behind her, in the mirror. MARGOT I think you smell nice.    You smell real. \nCLAUDE I stink. \nMARGOT It causes cancer. \nCLAUDE Underarm deodorant? \nMARGOT Yes. It's got chemicals and things that are extremely harmful. \nCLAUDE I'm not going to die from underarm cancer. \nMARGOT No, you'll get it somewhere else. Like your stomach or your testicles. \nCLAUDE (laughs) Testicles. \nMARGOT Don't laugh, that's a serious thing. Who told you this, anyway? Maisy? \nCLAUDE Yeah. \nMARGOT I hope you're not interested in that girl. I find her insufferable. \nCLAUDE What does that mean? \nMARGOT It means I can't suffer her. She's loud and stupid. She goes on about things of which she knows nothing about. CLAUDE She got into Harvard early. MARGOT Stupid people get into Harvard early all the time. \nCLAUDE Where did you go again? \nMARGOT Barnard. (pause) I just don't think you should do anything with her. \nCLAUDE (embarrassed) We're just friends. \nMARGOT If you do, use a condom. \nClaude looks into the toilet. A square of toilet paper with a red lip outline floats on top of the water. \nCLAUDE Where are you going? \n"}

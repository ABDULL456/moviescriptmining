{"test1_input": "Margot places her mallet down and starts toward the house. \nCLAUDE We're in the middle of it. \nMARGOT This is why I hate games.    I hate what it does to me. \nPauline cackles loudly. Margot turns around and stares at her. Malcolm calls from the stairs: \nMALCOLM (O.S.) Wait, we're not finished! \n19   EXT. PATIO - DAY                                                19 \nThe five eat a salad nicoise lunch. \nMARGOT Malcolm, do you notice how Pauline sometimes can't make eye-contact. How her gaze hovers just above your head. \nMALCOLM Yeah, I kind of know what you mean. \nMARGOT I always think I have something in my hair. It's not necessarily bad, Paul. It's just something you do. \nPauline looks mildly horrified.   She suddenly turns to Claude. PAULINE Claude have you ever seen your mother climb a tree? \nCLAUDE No. \nMARGOT We don't have much opportunity in Manhattan. \nPAULINE As kids Margot climbed everything. She could even climb that tree. \nShe points at the tall oak that stretches over the fence into the neighbor's property. \nCLAUDE Can you do it, mom? \nMARGOT Maybe later. \nCLAUDE No, now. \nINGRID Do it now, Margot! \nPAULINE Show him, Margot. \n20   CUT TO:                                                       20 \nMargot strides toward the tree.   The group follows behind. \nShe grabs hold of a branch and lifts herself. \nClaude grins, impressed. \nWith brisk dexterity, Margot scales the tree. \nClaude, Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid watch with glee from below. \nPAULINE I told you. Margot reaches a perch near the top and looks down at the gang. They wave. She waves back. The sun is hot. She sweats, flushed. She takes a deep breath and relaxes against the bark. Trees for miles. The neighbors' house is faded and grey. In the far distance, toxic white smoke comes out into the sky. \nAn earwig walks across her arm. She flicks it off, slips for a moment and catches herself. Her breathing grows more rapid. \nA bug buzzes around her head.   She swats at it. \nHer family has stopped watching. Claude and Malcolm throw a baseball. Pauline's gone back inside. Ingrid clears the table. \nMARGOT (under her breath) Shit. \nShe wipes her face, her shirt is almost entirely soaked.    The buzzing continues. \n", "test1_true": "Margot gasps.   She jams her pinky in her ear. \nPauline comes back out with an ice tea. \nCLAUDE What's she doing now? \nPAULINE (dryly) She's stuck. \n21   CUT TO:                                                      21 \nA young volunteer fireman climbs a long ladder up the side of the tree and toward Margot. He reaches out his hand to her. \nMARGOT (annoyed) I got it. \nShe slowly lowers herself. \n22   INT. LIVING ROOM - DAY                                       22 Pauline is laughing, recounting the story. Claude and Ingrid laugh too. Margot shakes her head, embarrassed and furious. CLAUDE You were great on the way up. MARGOT Don't patronize me, Claude. Margot turns her head to the side and pats on the top of it. PAULINE We're all laughing, Margot. \nMARGOT You're laughing in a kind way. Claude is taking too much pleasure out of it. \nCLAUDE I am not. \nMARGOT You are. You like to make fun of me. To see me get embarrassed. It's mean. \nSilence.   Margot puts her pinky back in her ear.   She frowns. \nPAULINE What are you doing? \nMARGOT I've got a fucking bug in my ear, okay? \n23   EXT. FOREST - DAY                                           23 \nPauline and Margot hike along a dirt trail. Claude and Ingrid idle behind, carrying walking sticks. \nPAULINE I thought Claude could hand out programs. Ingrid's going to sing. Do you want to read a poem or something? \nMARGOT You know I can't speak in front of people. I'm doing this \"conversation\" at the bookstore in town on Friday and I totally regret having said I'd do it. PAULINE You're doing a \"conversation?\" MARGOT Yeah, talking about my work in front of a crowd. I didn't invite you because...I thought it'd be boring. \nPAULINE Uh huh. \nMARGOT What?    Say it. \nPAULINE It's nothing. It's just...I would come...I want to come. I get a kick out of it. It's just weird, you know... So, you're not here for... (she stops herself) Okay, I get it. When did they ask you? \nMARGOT A while ago. I'd said, No, but then when I was coming here anyway and...I guess it helps sales and...so...so. \nPAULINE I see. \nWe catch a quick glimpse of people walking ahead in the path. \nPAULINE Did I tell you, Becky got her tubes tied. \nMARGOT Why? Is she seeing someone?   She's still obese, I assume. \nPAULINE I think it's symbolic. \nMARGOT I bet mom paid for it.   We should audit mom. \nPAULINE I considered it in my twenties. You know, when I was fucking everyone. You remember. MARGOT I did my share. PAULINE But not like me. \nMARGOT You want to count? \nPAULINE No, Margot, I don't want to count. (pause) What was it about Dad that had us fucking so many guys? \n", "test1_id": 2013, "test2_input": "MARGOT I think it was the only time we could really feel unselfconscious and get out of our heads. \nPAULINE (dismissive) I don't think that's it. I just think it was something we were good at. \nBehind, Ingrid smacks her walking stick into Claude's. \nINGRID Your mom thinks Bruce is gay. \nCLAUDE No, she said she had Aspergers. \nINGRID I thought that's what that means. \nCLAUDE No, it's like lesser retarded. \nINGRID I have adult ADD. \nCLAUDE You mean child ADD. \nINGRID No, for some reason I have the adult one. Maybe I'm retarded. Up ahead -- in the path -- is a couple, 40's, with a six year old girl. The back of the man's pants are smeared with dirt and the woman is packed into acid washed jeans. The little girl whines and lags behind. Margot and Pauline slow down.   Claude and Ingrid catch up. MAN Come on! LITTLE GIRL I don't want to! \nMAN Come on! \nLITTLE GIRL I don't want -- \nThe woman grabs the girl harshly by the arm and pulls her. The girl screams. \nMARGOT Hey! \nThe man and woman turn around sharply. \nMARGOT Be careful! \nWOMAN What? \nMARGOT Be careful the way you pull on that child's arm. You'll take it out of its socket. \nMAN Don't tell us how to treat our child. \nMARGOT I don't care how you treat your child as long as you don't hurt him. \nPAULINE (under her breath) It's a girl. \nWOMAN She threw a rock at me. MARGOT She's a little girl! WOMAN She knew what she was doing. She starts suddenly toward Margot. WOMAN There is no hitting in our family. Do you understand? \nMargot backs up quickly.    The woman stops about ten feet away. \nWOMAN Stay out of it, bitch. \nThe woman turns back around. She lifts the girl into her arms and they trudge over the incline and out of sight. \nINGRID That was the Voglers. \nPAULINE Jesus, Margot, what are you doing. They already hate us. \nMARGOT (wiping her eyes) Don't tell me what I can and can't do. That's child abuse. \nCLAUDE Mom, she was psychotic. \nMARGOT Stop picking on me.    Everyone. \n24   CUT TO:                                                         24 \nThe four of them emerge into a clearing.     Nobody speaks.    A child's pink sneaker lies in the path. \n", "test2_true": "Pauline walks over to it.    She crouches. \nPAULINE It could be anyone's. Margot bursts into tears.    Pauline hesitates then holds her. \nINGRID What are they going to do to us? PAULINE They're not going to do anything, honey. \n25   EXT. FRONT PORCH - DAY                                          25 Malcolm looks at Pauline. He's in the midst of writing a letter on a legal pad. Pauline is worked up. \nPAULINE We have to cut down that tree. \nMALCOLM Where are we going to get married then? \nPAULINE I don't...we'll do it in the fucking drive-way if we have to. \nClaude and Ingrid listen from just inside the house.   Ingrid looks at Claude nervously. \nINGRID Your mom started a war. We have to make sure we wear shoes because they might start throwing glass. \nCLAUDE Has that happened before? \nINGRID I can't remember. I think so. No, it definitely has. Now I remember. \nBehind them, Margot, made-up and wearing a dress, clomps down the stairs, across the carpet and onto the porch. \nPAULINE Where are you going? \nMARGOT (tersely) To town. I'll be back for dinner. \nPAULINE Come on, nobody blames you, Margot. \nAn old orange BMW idles at the end of the driveway. Pauline, Malcolm, Claude and Ingrid watch Margot cross the drive-way. A man, 50's, opens the passenger door. He smokes a brown cigarette. Margot gets in. The man waves at the group on the patio. Pauline, Malcolm and Ingrid and Claude wave back. CLAUDE Is that Dick Koosman? PAULINE Yeah.   He has a house up here. \nCLAUDE What's he doing with mom? \nPAULINE Good question. \n26   EXT. HOUSE - DAY                                              26 \nIngrid sits at the roots of the tree, squeezing honey out of a honey bear onto her hand -- she watches the ants come. Claude sits on a low branch and looks over the fence: \nINGRID How much do your parents make in a year? \nCLAUDE I think about a hundred.    They bank at Chase. \nThe front door of the Vogler's opens and a boy, 14, pees from the entrance-way into the plants in the yard. \nINGRID Are they rich? \nCLAUDE No.   They're middle class. \nThe boy finishes and violently hurls a toy car at the fence. \nBOY Just let me live! \nThe toy lands a few feet short.   He goes inside and closes the door. \nINGRID Upper or lower? CLAUDE I think just middle. Claude watches: Malcolm scurries around the side of the Vogler house holding a dead mole by its tail. He stumbles, recovers and flings the animal at the front door.   He races back toward his property. 27   EXT. PORCH - EVENING                                          27 \nMargot and Malcolm have cocktails. Pauline drinks a bottled water. Ingrid has cray pas, markers and paper and draws at a table. She draws a mole. \nClaude draws a boy with a big claw for a hand and CLAWED under it. Wizard, the dog, lies at his feet. \nMARGOT Dick and his daughter asked us over to swim tomorrow. \n", "test2_id": 2014, "test3_input": "Margot takes Claude's arm and walks quickly in the opposite direction. Claude, confused, glances over his shoulder. MARGOT Don't look. Keep walking. CLAUDE Why are we -- MARGOT We have to get you to your bus. \n80   CUT TO:                                                   80 \nA huge parking lot. A bus in the distance.   Claude tries to keep pace with his mother. \nCLAUDE Did you do something? \nMARGOT What do you mean, do something? \nCLAUDE I mean, why is the wedding not happening? Is there something that you did? \nMARGOT Pauline has transferred all her stuff onto me. I don't understand her anymore. Why'd she pick this man? It is really berserk. And you know, she referred to me as her closest friend. We never see one anoth -- \nAn unfamiliar sound comes out of Margot. The sadness is unexpected -- she sobs uncontrollably. She tries to speak: \nMARGOT I mean we're not close.   Even if we want to be. You know? \nCLAUDE But was there anything real? \nMARGOT No! How many times do I have to say it? Jesus. You think so little of me. (through her sobs) It's good you're going. You shouldn't be around me either. I'd go if I were you... CLAUDE Will you find Pauline and Nana after I leave? MARGOT (half-serious) I don't know. Maybe I'll go to church. \nMargot is sweating. She wipes her brow with her sleeve. She periodically looks behind her. Nobody seems to be following. \nCLAUDE (growing nervous) Are you angry at me? \nMARGOT No, honey.     I'm not mad at you. \nCLAUDE I don't want to go with you mad at anyone. \nMARGOT Everything's fine.    I'm not mad at anyone. \nUp ahead is a tiny depot.    People climb onto a white bus. \nCLAUDE Can you come with me? \nMARGOT No, you know that. (pause) We should talk about the next few months a little bit and what's going to happen -- \nCLAUDE I don't like Vermont. \nMARGOT Your dad will be very happy to see you. And I'm sure Josh is dying to hang out. \nCLAUDE Please come, mom. MARGOT (suddenly irritable) Claude, stop it. Okay? She watches a man sustain a long embrace with another man. Margot closes her eyes. She breathes deeply. MARGOT You used to need me to watch you when you played. \nCLAUDE What do you mean? \nMARGOT (vaguely) When you first started to play with friends, you wouldn't do it unless I watched you. You were afraid I would go out the back door. I don't know where I would go. Our yard didn't lead anywhere anyway. \nShe takes off her sweater and reveals an old faded yellow T- shirt. She isn't wearing a bra. Claude says suddenly: \nCLAUDE I masturbated last night. While everyone was asleep I went into the bathroom and did it. \nMARGOT You don't have to tell me, sweety. \nThe bus driver slams the luggage compartment closed. \nMARGOT You've got to go. \nMargot ties her sweater around her waist and takes Claude's hand. They approach the bus. Claude's body tenses. \nCLAUDE How will you get home? \nMARGOT I don't know. I'll see. Maybe Dick can drive me to the... (pause) Jesus, I lost the word for a second. The train. CLAUDE Uh huh. He looks at her longingly. MARGOT Come on. You always don't want to leave me and you always have a good time once you do. (provocatively) I think you like getting away from me. \n", "test3_true": "She hugs him.   He clutches her. \nCLAUDE The world feels strange to me right now. \nMargot nods sympathetically. She kisses his lips and releases him. He reaches into his bag and shyly puts on his wrap-around punk sunglasses. Margot makes a face. \nCLAUDE What? \nMARGOT They make your face look too wide. \nClaude removes them and puts them back in the bag. \nCLAUDE See you soon. \nMARGOT Bye, sweety. \nCLAUDE Say, you'll see me \"soon.\" \nMARGOT You're acting like a baby. \nShe backs away -- \nCLAUDE Don't see Dick. \nMARGOT Don't worry. I don't think he wants to see me anyway. CLAUDE Please, Margot. Promise me. MARGOT (hesitates) Don't call me that. \nClaude doesn't move. Margot points at the bus and mouths \"Go\". She turns in the other direction. Claude, frustrated and anxious approaches the vehicle. \n81   INT. BUS - CONTINUOUS                                        81 \nClaude hurries toward the back and finds a window seat.    He puts his bag next to him and looks out the dirty glass. \nClaude's POV: Margot, her back to him, puts her finger in her ear and shakes her head. \nThe sweater around her waist loosens and drifts to the pavement. She starts walking. \nThe bus hisses and lurches forward.    Claude strains to see: \nMargot looks back. \nThe bus groans as it picks up speed.   Margot sprints. \nMARGOT Wait! \nShe's runs full speed, waving her arms wildly. \nMARGOT Wait!   Wait! \nShe pants, breathless. \nThe bus brakes. \nShe passes Claude's window. We stay on Claude. He waits. Finally, she appears next to him, covered in sweat, and panting. She kisses him on the head. The bus starts moving. \nMARGOT (almost euphoric) Did you see me running out there? \nCLAUDE Yeah. Margot cranes her neck to see outside. \nMARGOT Good. That was a lot of running. I'm out of breath.

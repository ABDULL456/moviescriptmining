SIDNEY Yeah? 
DEWEY(O.S.) (off phone) Help me Sid! The killer's got me! 
SIDNEY Dewey?! OHMIGOD! Where are you?! 
DEWEY(O.S.) Sid I can see you! 
SIDNEY Where are you Dewey? 
DEWEY(O.S.) I'm out back. Tied up. Hurry Sid! The killer's looking for you! Quick untie me! 
Sid bolts through the shattered patio door out onto the backyard set. Seated before a heated in ground pool, tied to a patio chair, beaten and gagged, is DEWEY RIELLY. He's unconscious and almost appears at first glance like STEVEN ORTH from SCREAM. Sid's jaw drops. This can't be possible. She looks down at the phone. 
DEWEY(O.S.) Good work Sid. 
Sid screams, dropping the phone out of fright. She turns around coming face to face with -- 
THE GHOST 
HE STANDS in the patio doorway. A monstrous version of the voice-changing box in hand. He raises up the box, clicks a button and speaks. 
GHOST (Sid's voice) You play a good game Sidney. Now it's time to get down to business. 
SIDNEY Who are you? 
GHOST (click-now he's Maureen's voice) Your other half. 
The GHOST rushes Sid. She screams, takes off running. She bolts across the darkened set, running straight up the front porch of a mock-up of her own childhood home. She swings open the front door, slams it closed. 
INT.  PRESCOTT HOUSE - SET - NIGHT 
Sid locks and bolts the front door. She backs away from it as the killer begins to pounce against it, struggling to get inside. Sid hears something upstairs. Like muffled cries. She races up to investigate. 
CUT TO: 
INT.  SIDNEY'S BEDROOM - SET - NIGHT 
Sid enters the set of her bedroom, slowly drawing out the gun she stole from Kincaid's office. 
LYING on the bed, bound and gagged, is -- 
GALE WEATHERS 
SIDNEY GALE! 
Sid races over, removes the gag from Gale's mouth. 
GALE Christ Sidney hurry up! That fucking lunatic is coming! 
Sid fumbles with the bindings, manages to untie Gale. Gale sits up. 
SIDNEY Gale he's got Dewey! 
GALE I know! He killed Kincaid! 
SIDNEY I know!

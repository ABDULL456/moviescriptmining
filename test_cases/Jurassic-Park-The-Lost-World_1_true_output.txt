JUTTSON That doesn't say a thing about T-rex, they could have been rogues.  Robert Burke certainly thinks they were. 
SARAH We've got to see one to find out. Is there any -- 
MALCOLM No way. 
NICK Oh, my God. 
SARAH -- way we could safely -- 
NICK Oh, no! 
He takes off, running as fast as he can, down the trail, toward base camp.  They look ahead, in the direction Nick is running.  A plume of black smoke is rising up over the trees. 
EDDIE Fire! 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BASE CAMP - DAY 
NICK bursts out of the trees and races toward the thick plume of smoke.  In the middle of the base camp, someone has neatly built a campfire surrounded by stones.  Flames burn in the middle. 
Nick races over to it and stomps it out as the OTHERS emerge from the trees behind him. 
MALCOLM A campfire?! 
Nick grabs a jug of water, but Sarah steps in. 
SARAH No!  Water mixes the smoke billow, use dirt! 
They start to kick and rake dirt onto the fire with their hands and feet.  Eddie and Dr. Juttson jump in and help out. 
MALCOLM Who the hell started a campfire?! 
VOICE (o.s.) It was just to make lunch. 
Malcolm turns toward the source of the voice.  KELLY stands in the doorway of the trailer, sheepish. 
KELLY (cont'd) I wanted it ready when you got back. 
The whole group stares, stunned, none more so than Malcolm himself. 
MALCOLM Oh ... man. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. BASE CAMP - LATER 
Later, and base camp is a blur of activity.  SARAH, JUTTSON, NICK, and EDDIE are hard at work, burying the remains of the fire, sealing their food in plastic bags, loading camera equipment, packing up specimen containers and other information-gathering equipment. 
MALCOLM, meanwhile, is lecturing Kelly. 
MALCOLM You know you were putting yourself in a potentially dangerous situation, but you didn't bother to find out how dangerous before you leapt in. You don't have the faintest idea what's going on on this island! 
SARAH (loading a backpack) What do you want to do, Ian, lock her up for curiosity?  Where do you think she gets it? 
JUTTSON (to Nick) Do you have chromium tapes?  The others fog in high- 
NICK -humidity, I know. (waving a tape) Highest lead density on the market. 
EDDIE (to Malcolm) We've got a lot of heavy marching ahead of us.  I'm not carrying anybody. 
KELLY I can keep up. 
MALCOLM You're going home.  I'm sending a radio call for the boats.  We'll all go down to the lagoon and wait for them. 
SARAH Lighten up, Ian, you sound like a high school vice-principal. 
MALCOLM I'm her father. 
KELLY Sure, now. 
Nick leans over and whispers to Eddie, gesturing to Malcolm and Kelly. 
NICK Do you see any family resemblance here? 
MALCOLM You can't stay, Kelly, that's it. It's too dangerous. 
SARAH If it's so dangerous, why'd you bring any of us? 
KELLY You're wrong, Dad.  I do know what's going on on this island. 
MALCOLM How could you possibly? 
KELLY Because you said so.  Maybe nobody else believed you, but I always did. 
He looks at her, touched.  Nick mutters to Eddie again. 
NICK The kid scores with cheap sentiment. 
SARAH Ian, if we recall the boat now, we've made two invasive landings in one day.  That'll have to go in any paper I write, and it will leave room for people to say our findings were contaminated.  You know the academic world as well as I do, once they smell blood in the water, you're dead.  Our presence has got to be one hundred percent antiseptic.  That means if we bend a blade of grass, we bend it right back the way it- 
A low sound has been rising while she speaks, and now it comes BOOMING over the jungle around them, a THUNDEROUS racket that shakes the very ground beneath them.  Suddenly, three C-130 military cargo planes THUNDER overhead and ROAR toward the island interior, flying very low.  The planes are enormous, fat-assed creatures, their rear cargo doors hanging open.

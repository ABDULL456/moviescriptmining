59   INT. NATALIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT <>	  59 
Leonard enters the dark room. He goes to the couch and picks up his shirt and his jacket. He notices the photograph which Natalie showed him on top of some papers on a desk in the corner. He holds it in a shaft of light from the streetlamp outside, studying the photo of Natalie and Jimmy. 
60   INT. NATALIE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT <>		 60 
Natalie, eyes open, slides her hand over to where Leonard was lying, feeling his residual warmth. 
ii	61   INT. NATALIE'S LIVING ROOM - NIGHT <> 
Leonard has his Polaroid photograph of Natalie out. He takes a pen out of his jacket, rests the photo against the wall in a patch of light and writes on the back, underneath the message which has been scribbled out: 
"SHE HAS ALSO LOST SOMEONE. SHE WILL HELP YOU OUT OF PITY"

Leonard enters, deposits his jacket and shirt, then slides into bed next to Natalie. 
63   INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE##	   63 
Leonard lies on the bed (in boxers, bandaged arm) talking on    * the phone. He wipes the excess shaving foam from his thigh, and feels the SMOOTHNESS of the clean-shaven skin. 
LEONARD Sammy's wife was crippled by the cost of supporting him and fighting the company's decision - but it wasn't the money that got to her. 
64   INT. JANKIS HOUSE LIVING ROOM - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE	   64 SEQUENCE## 
Mrs. Jankis comes into the room. Sammy is seated, watching T.V. He looks up at her with a smile. She smiles back, tense. 
LEONARD (V.0.) I never said that Sammy was faking. Just that his problem was mental, not physical. But she... she couldn't understand. She looks into his eyes and sees the same person. And if it's not a physical problem... 
Sammy's Wife starts shouting at Sammy. Sammy squirms. 
LEONARD (V.0.) (CONT'D) ... he should just... snap out of it. 
Sammy's Wife THROWS her drink in Sammy's face, puts her head in her hands, SOBBING. Sammy wipes his face on his sleeve. 
BACK TO LEONARD IN MOTEL ROOM: 
65   INT. MOTEL ROOM 21 - DAY ##BLACK AND WHITE SEQUENCE##	   65 
Leonard, talking on the phone, empties the white paper bag onto the bed beside him: Two cheap BALL-POINT PENS, SCOTCH TAPE, a pack of NEEDLES, and a FILE CARD.

LEONARD (cont'd) So good old Leonard Shelby from the insurance company gives her the seed of doubt, just like he gave it to the doctors. But I never said that Sammy was faking. I never said that. 
Leonard takes a NEEDLE out of the packet. 
66   INT. LEONARD'S APARTMENT WITH HIGH CEILINGS AND WOODEN FLOOR 66 - NIGHT <> 
We move along a hallway towards a closed door. An ominous	  * rumbling builds. 
A66  INSERT QUICK CUTS:							   A66 
TREMBLING, SHALLOW-FOCUS EXTREME CLOSE UPS: 
A glass bottle SHATTERS against black and white ceramic tiles. A SUDDEN MOVEMENT glimpsed through a water-beaded clear plastic shower curtain. 
The shower curtain pulls TAUT across a GASPING FEMALE FACE. 
Leonard's REFLECTION in a MIRROR which SHATTERS. 
67   INT. DODD'S MOTEL ROOM - DAY <>		   67 
Leonard opens his eyes, frightened. He is lying on the bed in his beige suit and blue shirt. 
LEONARD (V.0.) Awake. 
He rolls his eyes to one side. 
LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd) Where am I? 
He lifts his head and surveys the room. 
LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd) Motel room. 
He rises from the bed, looking at the room as if for the first time. He starts looking in the dresser drawers, finding nothing. 
LEONARD (V.O.)(cont'd) Some anonymous motel room. Nothing in the drawers, but you look anyway.

He grasps the handle of the bedside drawer. 
LEONARD (V.O.) (cont'd) Never anything but the Gideon... 
Leonard pulls the drawer open, and pauses at what he sees. 
LEONARD (V.O.) (cont'd) ... Bible. 
In the drawer is a Gideon Bible. Resting on top of it is a HANDGUN. 
Leonard turns, looks over the rest of the room. He moves to the bureau and opens drawers. Empty. He goes to the closet and OPENS it. 
Inside is a BOUND and GAGGED MAN on the floor, knees against chest. His mouth is taped up with silver electrical tape, stained with DRIED BLOOD from his swollen nose. He looks up at Leonard, blinking in the sudden bright light, TERRIFIED. 
Leonard SHUTS the closet door, CONFUSED. The Man in the closet starts GRUNTING and BUMPING the closet door. 
There is a KNOCK at the door. Leonard looks through the peephole.

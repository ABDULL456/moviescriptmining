29 EXT. SCHOOL - NIGHT 29 
Lit by spotlights, a large banner over the entrance reads, "THE WITCH'S CURSE - presented by BLITHE HOLLOW MIDDLE SCHOOL DRAMA SOCIETY - written, produced and directed for the stage by Margot Henscher". A notice beneath it reads "SPELLING BEE - NEXT WENSDAY". A chorus of kids' voices can be heard SINGING from inside, belting out an operatic rendition of Donovan's "Season of the Witch". 
INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - SAME 
Rows of plastic chairs in front of the spotlit stage are occupied by expectant families. Among the sea of faintly buzzing video cameras, and a ripple of APPLAUSE, Sandra politely smiles at the acting talents of other peoples' children. Next to her, Perry struggles to fit a battery into his camera. 
PERRY BABCOCK Great, now we'll never get to remember this moment. ANGLE ON STAGE as Salma, in full witch get-up, waves her hands theatrically at the other children. 
SALMA I curse you accusers to die a horrible and gruesome death and rise from your graves as the living dead; your souls doomed to an eternity of damnation! The Pilgrims who aren't dying and rising from the dead begin to menace Salma with their farming implements, and begin a slow ominous chant. 
KIDS Kill the witch! Kill the witch! Sandra nudges her husband and cheerily points toward the stage. 
SANDRA BABCOCK Gosh, aren't they adorable? Norman hears a HOOTING sound from above. An owl with big glowing eyes wheels down over the audience from the beams of the gymnasium. Norman glances around, wondering why no one else seems to notice as it glides low and alights in the papier mache branches on Neil's head. It turns to Norman and HOOTS. ParaNorman 22. 
30 CONTINUED: 30 He looks down from it and catches Neil's eye. Neil makes a puzzled expression. 
NEIL What? 
KIDS Kill the witch! Kill the witch! The chanting seems to deepen and slur and the air grows dark and thick. The shapes of the audience and the kids beside him swim around, blurring like a finger pulled through oil paint. The ceiling disintegrates into clouds, which CRACKLE with lightning. 
NORMAN (under his breath) Oh no! Not again! All around trees have sprouted out of nowhere, and through the darkness in the distance are occasional lights of small houses. This might be how this very spot looked three centuries ago. 
EXT. OLD FOREST - NIGHT 
As Norman turns on the spot GASPING, he hears a RUSTLE in the bushes behind him and spots several dark and ominous figures in Pilgrim clothing scouring the undergrowth. 
PURITAN Witch! We know you're out there! Norman stands on a twig which, naturally, CRACKS loudly, and the figure turns around and points at him. 
PURITAN (CONT'D) There! 
NORMAN No! 
PURITAN Witch. More figures emerge from out of the darkness, wielding hayforks. They SHOUT threateningly and, as one man, surge toward him. Norman turns and runs. The trees around him are shifting, but there's no wind blowing the branches. Limbs GROAN as they twist, bearing down on him like ragged talons trying to stop his escape. Soon he can run no further, the way ahead tangled up into a wall of thorny fingers. ParaNorman 23. 
31 CONTINUED: 31 Norman finds himself pushed up against the trunk of a huge tree, and a knothole grimaces at him, wood splitting open into a hag-like mouth. It furrows a mossy brow and speaks in a low rumbling voice. 
TREE The dead are coming! Norman GASPS and tries to push himself away, but the pursuing figures are drawing closer, and there's no escape. A familiar voice whispers out of nowhere. 
NEIL (O.S.) Hey buddy! Are you okay? Norman turns around to find the knothole is now Neil's face, bulging out of the side of the tree with a look of concern. This is the last straw, and Norman SCREAMS. 
INT. SCHOOL GYMNASIUM - NIGHT 
Norman stands next to Neil on stage, eyes closed and WAILING. Everyone around him stares in stunned silence as, still SCREAMING, he runs into the spotlight.

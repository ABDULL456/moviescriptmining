VALENTINA Say it. 
DR. PARNASSUS You. 
VALENTINA What? 
DR. PARNASSUS I was mortal again... on condition that... any children I fathered... would, on their sixteenth birthday... belong to him. 
VALENTINA (stunned) Him?... 
VALENTINA can't take it in. 
VALENTINA (CONT'D) But... didn't... 
DR. PARNASSUS Your mother never knew. She died before I had to tell her. 
VALENTINA I don't believe this! It can't be true. It's just another of your wretched stories... A cruel story! 
DR. PARNASSUS If only... 
(CONTINUED) 
59   CONTINUED: (4)                                              59 
VALENTINA Why do you say these things? 
DR. PARNASSUS It's true. Every word. But all is not lost. 
VALENTINA looks at him. 
DR. PARNASSUS (CONT'D) (feverishly) A new wager... The first of five. If I win... you're free... you're mine again.. and we can win! Where's Tony? We can still win! 
VALENTINA By playing games with the devil!? 
DR. PARNASSUS With one more show. The day isn't over. 
VALENTINA No! 
DR. PARNASSUS Valentina. 
VALENTINA All my life you've made me play `Beauty', `Truth', `Justice'... filled my head with dreams and high ideals. All that crap! While... all the time...! The devil was right! You're arrogant! Vain and arrogant! I'm just another one of your stupid wagers!... You're beneath contempt. 
She rushes off into the dark night. 
DR. PARNASSUS Valentina! That's not true! It's not like that! Wait! Come back! Valentina! 
A dark silhouette stands in the shadow of the wagon. It's TONY. What has he heard? 
60   INT   THE WAGON     MOMENTS LATER                          60 
DR. PARNASSUS rushes into the wagon. 
PERCY is already on his feet, having heard the DOCTOR shouting. 
ANTON What's happened? 
DR. PARNASSUS Valentina... She's... she's gone... 
ANTON rushes out. 
PERCY stops by DR. PARNASSUS before he exits. 
PERCY Telling the truth... Always a bad idea. 
61   EXT   MONTAGE OF SCENES   NIGHT                            61 
ANTON, running, calling for VALENTINA. 
PERCY is scouring the area on horseback. 
ANTON running though a newspaper-filled tip, sees a headline on one of the newspapers. Stops. 
62   EXT   THE WAGON     A LITTLE LATER                         62 
PARNASSUS, a bottle in his hand, is lurching around. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS You fool! You monstrous fool!    You should be dead. 
He starts to violently bang his head against the side of the wagon. 
Suddenly the stage begins to unfold. PARNASSUS looks up, unable to see what or who is doing this. He drunkenly stumbles around the side to see TONY pulling ropes. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (CONT'D) What are you doing? 
(CONTINUED) 
62   CONTINUED:                                               62 
TONY Saving Valentina. 
DOCTOR PARNASSUS (befuddled) What?... How? 
TONY I overheard you. You only need one more to win. Me! I'll be that one. I'll take the risk to save Valentina and, hopefully, you sir. We've still got a few minutes.

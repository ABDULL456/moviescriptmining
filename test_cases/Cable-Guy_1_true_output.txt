STEVEN No, I'm going home. 
Steven turns to leave. 
CABLE GUY Well, uh, I guess we'll talk later. I've got to go shower up and do some stuff. I'll call you if I get a chance. Or you call me or something. 
The Cable guy puts his hand up for Steven to high five. Steven slaps it halfheartedly. Then the cable guy extends his palm out low by his knee. 
CABLE GUY And down low. 
Steven stares at it for a beat. The cable Guy waits. He'll wait as long as it takes. Finally Steven gives him a low five just so he can leave. 
CABLE GUY (pulls his hand away so Steven misses it) Too slow. Have a good one. 
STEVEN (as he walks away) Yeah, have a good one. 
26	INT. STEVEN'S APARTMENT - NEXT NIGHT 
Steven runs in with a small bag of groceries. He is dressed for a date. He pulls out a bottle of wine. He opens the oven, and checks on dinner. It is almost ready. Then he checks his message machine as he prepares the meal. He begins chopping an onion. 
(Revised 11/13/95 - Blue) 
MESSAGE VOICE You have eleven messages. 
STEVEN'S MOTHER (ON THE MACHINE) Steven, it's mom. Give me a call. I'm still your mother. 
STEVEN'S FATHER (ON THE MACHINE) I'm getting on. Steven call your mother. 
CABLE GUY (ON THE MACHINE) Hey Steven. Just checking in. Give me a ring. I'm at 555-4329. (beep) What's up Steven? I'm at a pay phone. If you're there pick up. Pick up. Pick up. Okay, I'll be home later. I'll talk to you then. 
Steven stops chopping. 
CABLE GUY (ON THE MACHINE) (beep) Okay I'm home now. Give me a buzz when you get in. I'll be here pretty much all night. Bye. (beep tone) Hey Steven. Quick question, give me a call when you get a chance. (beep tone) I was just taking a whiz, thought you might have called. Okay later. (beep tone) Sorry, I had call waiting, didn't get to it, thought it might have been you. All right, bye. 
Steven is beginning to get a little wigged out by this. He fast forwards through a sampling of the rest of the calls. 
CABLE GUY (fast forwards) We're having ourselves quite a little game of phone tag here. You're it! (fast forwards) I was just blow drying my hair and I thought I heard the phone ringing. (fast forwards) you're a tough man to reach. (fast forwards) I guess you're too busy to call your friends. 
(Revision Ends - Blue) 
Steven fast forwards the machine. All he hears is sighing. Then  
CABLE GUY (ON THE MACHINE) (long beat - then quiet and distant) Shit. 
The doorbell rings. Steven takes a deep breath then opens the door. It is Robin. She is dressed casually, but looks beautiful. 
STEVEN Hey, good to see you. 
There is an awkward moment where Steven intentionally doesn't kiss her hello. 
STEVEN Come on in. What do you think of the place? 
She looks at the odd placement of furniture. 
ROBIN You made some interesting choices laying out the room. 
STEVEN (embarrassed) That's actually where the movers put the furniture. I'm gonna change it, very soon. 
ROBIN No, I like it. 
27	INT. STEVEN'S LIVING ROOM - LATER 
The food is all eaten. Steven and Robin are sitting on the couch having an awkward conversation. 
ROBIN So how's work? 
STEVEN Work's good. 
ROBIN How's Hal? 
STEVEN Don't get me started. That guy has no vision. It's like working for Mr. MaGoo. He's just worthless. 
ROBIN It's just great that you're getting to do it. It's a real step up. 
STEVEN I know. Now if only someone at corporate smartened up enough to dump Hal, then I could really get some stuff done. 
ROBIN It's nice to see you doing so well.

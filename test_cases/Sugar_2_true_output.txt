Carmen snatches the phone from Erica, who stays close, trying to listen in. 
CARMEN Miguelito, what is going on? Frank called last night. Where are you? 
MIGUEL New York. 
CARMEN Oh, my God! What are you doing in New York? I don't understand. Your team is looking for you. 
MIGUEL I can't play anymore. 
CARMEN Are you hurt? What does that mean, you can't play?

MIGUEL No.   I'm fine. It just-- 
CARMEN We've been working for this your whole life, Miguelito. Oh, my God! You're so close. I don't understand... 
MIGUEL Don't worry, mom. I have some money. We're going to be okay. 
CARMEN You have to go back. Listen, Miguel, my sweet sugar, call Frank. They'll take you back. 
MIGUEL I can't go back-- 
CARMEN Did I raise you like this?    Did I raise you to give up? 
MIGUEL I didn't give up. I'm starting something new here. 
CARMEN What?   What are you starting? 
MIGUEL I have to go mom. The card's almost out of minutes. 
CARMEN Where are you even staying?   Miguel-- 
MIGUEL Don't worry. I'm staying with a friend. I have a new job. It's all good. I'm sending money tomorrow. 
CARMEN Miguel-- 
MIGUEL I love you.    I'm sorry. 
Miguel hangs up, stares off.

195   INT. WESTERN UNION - MORNING                                      195 
CAMERA TRACKS past a long line of IMMIGRANTS in all shapes and sizes, preparing to wire money back home, wherever that is. 
MINUTES LATER. Miguel looks at the few bills in his wallet, hands two fifties to the TELLER. 
196   INT. EL CARIBE RESTAURANT - DAY                                   196 
Miguel leans over the counter, talks to Reyna, the waitress. 
MIGUEL Hey, um, I was in here the other day. 
REYNA Yeah, sure, did you find your guy? 
MIGUEL No. I'm actually looking for a job today. 
She smiles, calls over to... 
REYNA Fernando! (leans close to Miguel) Tell him you like his shirt. 
Reyna moves away, and Miguel glances over to the approaching MANAGER. He's wearing an outrageously colorful tropical shirt. 
197   INT. EL CARIBE RESTAURANT - KITCHEN                               197 
CLOSE ON Miguel's hand scraping uneaten food into the trash. 
His new co-worker, RAFAEL (the same bus boy from Miguel's first visit), shows Miguel how to use the dishwasher. 
RAFAEL And then put it in here with the others. 
Miguel puts the plate in the large dish washer. 
RAFAEL When it's full, set to scrub, and there it is. 
Miguel stares at the machine as it HUMS and WHIRS.

Miguel and Rafael sit next to each other in the back, eating dinner. 
MIGUEL Do you know anybody with a room for rent? 
Rafael shakes his head, no. 
RAFAEL But I'll ask around, let you know if I hear of anything. 
Miguel nods, gets back to his food. 
RAFAEL You and Jorge used to play baseball together? 
MIGUEL Yeah, you like baseball?

EXT. BLACK HILLS - HIGHWAY - DAY 
One hundred miles-per-hour plus. Whip around to SEE -- 
BLAZE AND NOMI, riding their cycles. Up ahead is a postal truck. Blaze HONKS, waves to the DRIVER. He's got a postcard in his hand. He hands it to the driver through the open door, then decreases his speed, falling back alongside Nomi. As they scream over a hill, we SEE the White Buffalo Indian Casino and Lodge in the distance. 
NOMI I don't like this. I spent the last six years trying to forget this place. 
BLAZE You got any idea where Billy-Ray might be headed? 
NOMI 
NO -- 
BLAZE Then we should start with where he's been. 
INT. INDIAN CASINO - DAY 
A chiming CACOPHONY. Acres of penny slots and video poker. Roulette wheels CLATTERING. Blackjack tables spinning. Blaze and Nomi weave their way through the maze. 
BLAZE Your husband used to work here? 
NOMI Billy-Ray dealt blackjack, poker. Worked the casino circuit. We met in Vegas. Things kind of went downhill after that. 
RODENBURG (O.S.) Got a lot of nerve showing your face here again. 
CONTINUED: They turn. Chief of Security, VINCE RODENBURG (30s, full--or- himself), storms towards them, flanked by TWO SECURITY GOONS. 
NOMI Believe me, Vince, this is the last place I want to be. But we need to find Billy- Ray. He took Rain. 
RODENBURG Sorry' The Deal Man hasn't been back in weeks. (gesturing for them to leave) You have a nice day now. 
NOMI But you must've talked to him. Do you know where he's headed? Just tell me that. 
RODENBURG What am I? His babysitter? I don't know where he is, Nome, and if I did, I sure as hell wouldn't be telling you. (looking to the other guards) Show these two ass-holes to the door. 
BLAZE Look, this is important. We're talking about a kidnapping. 
RODENBURG (sizing Blaze up) We are? And who is ? 
BLAZE I'm just a friend. 
RODENBURG Ri h t. Nomi tell you what a blue ribbon slut she was? Do anything to support that needle habit of hers. Truth, 'bout the only person that hasn't had her around here is me. Blaze steps forward now, angry, threatening. 
BLAZE That's enough. 
RO DENBURG What, you gonna get all Steven Segal on me, tough guy? Pull a fucking Glimmer Man? 
CONTINUED: (2) Blaze moves, twists Rodenburg's arm like rope, wrenches his thumb backwards, SLAMS Rodenburg face-first into one of those Plexiglas booths where people dive for dollars. The goons pull their pieces. Blaze just ups the pain. 
RODENBURG (CONT'D) -w-w--wait!! ! (in agony, grimacing) --oh, fuck, just wait a second -- The goons hesitate. CUSTOMERS stare. Blaze seethes. 
BLAZE I need you to understand something, Vince. I am, by nature, an inherently violent man and there's not much in the way of bad that I haven't already inflicted on this miserable world -- (applying even more pressure) So unless the idea of learning to drive a wheelchair with your mouth sounds appealing, I suggest you apologize to my friend and tell us WHERE THE FUCK BILLY- 
RAY IS HEADED! 
RODENBURG I don't know! I don't know -- Blaze gives Rodenburg's thumb a savage twist. 
RODENBURG (CONT'D) Arrrghh! H-he was -- ngh -- up at their old house, last night! 
BLAZE And? 
RODENBURG And I'm sorry -- I'm fucking sorry! Blaze releases him. As the goons close in, Blaze deftly relieving Goon #1 of his handgun and turns it back on him. 
BLAZE Think about it. The goons relent. Blaze and Nomi exit, leaving Rodenburg slumped on the floor, cradling his mangled hand. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. TRACT HOMES - DUSK 
A swath of cheap housing, part-finished, mostly abandoned, back-boning a steep bluff that overlooks the casino. Blaze and Nomi dismount their bikes. She stares at a particularly ramshackle house. Wind whips. Dead leaves blow. A rusting swing-set twists and creaks.

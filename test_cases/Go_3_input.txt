Vic Jr. winces with pain. 
VICTOR [CONT'd] You know what wakes me up in the middle of the night, covered in sweat? You aren't any worse than anyone else of your fucked up generation. Towel. 
Noelle hands him a towel to mop up the blood. 
VICTOR [CONT'd] In the old days, you know how you got to the top? By being better than the guy ahead of you. (MORE) (CONTINUED) 
"GO" 8/26/98 Revisions (SALMON) 87   CONTINUED:                                                               87 VICTOR [CONT'd] (cont'd) How do you people get to the top? By being so fucking incompetent that the guy ahead of you can't even do his job, he falls on his ass and congratulations, you're on top. Only now the top is down here when it used to be up here and you don't even know the difference. 
He finishes the last stitch, tying it off. 
VICTOR [CONT'd] My generation, we're dinosaurs. We're gonna die. You're gonna kill us off. But you'll never be dinosaurs. You're little fucking rats and that's all you're ever going to be. 
Holly looks in, holding a gold card. Victor motions, "well?" She hands it over. 
HOLLY They said they were from Los Angeles. 
Noelle nods. 
VICTOR Then they must be staying somewhere, isn't that right Noelle? 
Noelle nods harder, crying again.

Pale and dehydrated, Tiny sits on the toilet. He HUMS the theme to "I Dream of Jeannie."

ANNOUNCER [V.O., ON T.V.] Once Karen learned these simple rules, she discovered blackjack was as easy as it was fun. 
Singh is propped up on one of the beds. He's just this side of death. Toilet FLUSHING. Tiny comes out of the bathroom, takes the other bed. 
ANNOUNCER [V.O.] Steve decided to try his hand at craps.

Tiny resumes HUMMING. After a few beats, Singh joins in with the theme to "Bewitched." The melodies blend surprisingly well. Just into the second chorus, the phone RINGS. 
TINY Yo! Mmmhmm. Room 875. 
He hangs up. 
SINGH Who was that? 
TINY Some shit, I dunno. 
90   INT. RAM CHARGER - NIGHT                                                   90 
In the passenger seat, Vic Jr. flips a cell phone shut. He was working through the yellow pages. 
VIC JR. They're at the Riviera. 
Victor changes lanes. He SLAMS on the horn, SHOUTING at the car that cut him off. 
VICTOR Motherfucker! 
91   EXT. THE STRIP - NIGHT                                                     91 
Climbing out of a cab, Marcus throws two bills at the DRIVER. Simon is already running down the sidewalk. 
92   INT. HOTEL LOBBY - NIGHT                                                   92 
Simon furiously pounds the elevator button. With a DING, doors finally open. He and Marcus get on. The doors shut. 
In the same shot, we WHIP BACK to look at the lobby, where Victor and Vic Jr. have just entered. They walk calmly but quickly. 
93   INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT                                                      93

A PLEASANT RETIRED COUPLE get on. Press `4.' The doors don't close. The Woman presses the `Door Open' button. 
THE MAN The other one, honey. 
She sees her mistake. The doors finally close. In the reflection, the Man looks back at Victor and Vic Jr. Smiles. 
THE WOMAN Sure is a fun way to spend Christmas, isn't it? 
No answer. The doors open. 
THE WOMAN This isn't our floor. 
The Man steps out of the elevator, looking around. 
THE MAN Maybe we're five. 
THE WOMAN Or six. We'll try both. 
She reaches for the panel. Victor grabs her hand. She GASPS, startled. Without saying a word, he shoves her off the elevator, BANGING on the door close button until it finally responds. 
94   INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                                    94 
Marcus and Simon burst in like a cyclone. Marcus grabs his clothes out of the closet. 
MARCUS All right, listen up. We're leaving in 30 seconds. Grab what you can. 
TINY What the fuck? 
Simon tosses Singh his wallet, pockets the keys.

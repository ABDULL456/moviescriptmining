EMILY Leave it to Jacob to get around Sam's gag order. BELLA He didn't say anything, or... couldn't. 
EMBRY That's a wolf thing. Alpha's orders get obeyed whether we want to or not -- 
JARED How `bout you shut up now, Embry? 
EMBRY You know Jacob's gonna fill her in. 
JARED Yeah, I know every stupid thought he has. (to Bella) Wanna know what he thinks of you? 
EMILY Like you need special powers to know that. 
EMBRY (to Bella) It's another wolf thing. We hear each other's thoughts. Good for hunting. Embarrassing for everything else. 
Jared leans to Bella, challenging. 
JARED Freaking out yet? 
BELLA (meets his look) You're not the first -- mind reader I've met. 
EMBRY (grins) Jake's right. You are good with the weird. 
BELLA But I don't get -- how?   Why? -- 
SAM (O.S.) -- Because there are bad things here. She spins - Sam is now standing behind her, the front door open behind him. 
SAM And they're getting worse. 
Bella is chilled. Sam moves past her to Emily - the sight of her instantly warms his face. 
SAM Hey, Em. 
He kisses Emily's scarred face adoringly. Bella has to look away. Their utter devotion is a painful reminder of what she has lost. Fortunately, she's distracted by -- 
Jacob and Paul's arrival. They laugh and jab one another. Bella is relieved to find Jacob unscathed. Jared and Embry crowd them, finding a scar on Paul's arm -- 
EMBRY Ha!   Pay up. As Jared reluctantly hands Embry five bucks, Jacob's eyes find Bella's. He nods solemnly to the door; we should talk. 
EXT. LA PUSH - CLIFFS - DAWN 
The sun is just beginning to rise, reddening the clouds overhead. Bella paces by the cliff's edge, trying to come to grips with this new reality. Jacob keeps his distance, trying to control his anger. 
BELLA You just have to... stop. 
JACOB It's not a life-style choice.   It's in my DNA. 
BELLA Killing is in your DNA? 
JACOB Man, I thought maybe you wouldn't be such a hypocrite -- what, I'm not the right kind of monster for you? Can't measure up to your bloodsucking friends -- 
BELLA (angry as well) Hey, they manage to survive without hurting innocent people. 
Jacob stops -- a beat as his anger is replaced by confusion. 
JACOB Wait - innocent? -- so... you don't care that I morph into a giant dog. Just that I... kill people? 
BELLA (appalled) "Just?" Those hikers' lives mean that little to you? 
He bursts out laughing. 
BELLA (repelled, turns to go) Oh my God. 
JACOB Bella -- Bella wait... (he stops her) We're not killing hikers.   We're trying to protect them. 
BELLA From what? 
JACOB The only thing we do kill: Vampires. 
BELLA (stunned, reels) Vampires? Jake, no -- 
JACOB (steps back, bitter) Don't worry, we can't touch your precious Cullens - unless they bite someone and violate the Treaty -- 
BELLA That's not what I -- you can't fight vampires. They're too dangerous. 
JACOB Please. We took out that leech with the dreads easy enough. 
BELLA You... killed Laurent? JACOB (worried) ... He didn't seem like a friend. 
BELLA No, God no.    But... how? 
JACOB It's what we do, why we exist. A few "lucky guys" in the tribe have the gene. If a bloodsucker moves to town, our DNA kicks in, we reach the right age and the fever hits -- 
BELLA (realizing) "Mono." 
JACOB I wish. Next thing I know, they're telling me, this is your life now. That future you saw for yourself? Gone.

WATTS (CONT'D) Hey. 
Martha just stands there quietly. 
INT. FARM HOUSE KITCHEN - EVENING 
Martha cooks with Katie. 
Martha sneaks a bite of bread. Katie whacks her in the ear with a wooden spoon. A slight ringing remains throughout the scene. 
KATIE Nothing till they're done. You know better. 
MARTHA I know. Sorry Katie. 
LUCY (O.S.) Who's Katie? 
INT. LAKE HOUSE KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Martha turns her head to see Lucy instead of Katie. Martha is at the lake house cooking with Lucy. 
MARTHA What? 
LUCY Who's Katie? 
MARTHA Oh, nothing. 
Beat. 
MARTHA (CONT'D) Lucy? 
LUCY Yeah. 
MARTHA Is this from the past or is this now? 
LUCY What? 
MARTHA I don't remember waking up this morning. 
LUCY Why don't you go sit down, I'll finish up. 
Lucy hands water and some pills to Martha. Martha takes the pills, walks into the other room and collapses on the couch in front of the television. 
Ted walks into the kitchen. Martha listens from the couch. 
He reaches out and holds her hand. 
TED What's going on? 
LUCY Who the fuck knows. 
TED She needs to see someone. 
LUCY I know. 
TED I'll start looking into places tomorrow. We can arrange for her to be somewhere by Wednesday. 
LUCY Places? 
TED I don't think she should stay with us anymore. We can't do anything for her when she's like this. 
Lucy goes back to chopping. 
LUCY I don't want to talk about it anymore.

ANDY If there's trouble, I doubt a rock- hammer will do me any good. 
RED Then I guess you wanna escape. Tunnel under the wall maybe? (Andy laughs politely) I miss the joke. What's so funny? 
ANDY 
You'll know when you see the rock- hammer. 
RED What's this item usually go for? 
ANDY Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop. 
RED My standard mark-up's twenty percent, but we're talkin' about a special object. Risk goes up, price goes up. Call it ten bucks even. 
ANDY Ten it is. 
RED I'll see what I can do. (rises, slapping dust) But it's a waste of money. 
ANDY Oh? 
RED Folks who run this place love surprise inspections. They turn a blind eye to some things, but not a gadget like that. They'll find it, and you'll lose it. Mention my name, we'll never do business again. Not for a pair of shoelaces or a stick of gum. 
ANDY I understand. Thank you, Mr...? 
RED Red. The name's Red. 
ANDY Red. I'm Andy. Pleasure doing business with you. 
They shake. Andy strolls off. Red watches him go. 
RED (V.O.) I could see why some of the boys took him for snobby. He had a quiet way about him, a walk and a talk that just wasn't normal around here. He strolled. like a man in a park without a care or worry. Like he had on an invisible coat that would shield him from this place. (resumes playing catch) Yes, I think it would be fair to say I liked Andy from the start. 
37	INT -- MESS HALL -- DAY (1947) 37 
Red gets his breakfast and heads for a table. Andy falls in step, slips him a tightly-folded square of paper. 
38	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 38 
Lying on his bunk, Red unfolds the square. A ten dollar bill. 
RED (V.O.) He was a man who adapted fast. 
39	EXT -- LOADING DOCK -- DAY (1947) 39 
Under watchful supervision, CONS are off-loading bags of dirty laundry from an "Eliot Nursing Home" truck. 
RED (V.O.) Years later, I found out he'd brought in quite a bit more than just ten dollars... 
A certain bag hits the ground. The TRUCK DRIVER shoots a look at a black con, LEONARD, then ambles over to a GUARD to shoot the shit. Leonard loads the bag onto a cart... 
40	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 40 
Bags are being unloaded. We find Leonard working the line. 
RED (V.O.) When they check you into this hotel, one of the bellhops bends you over and looks up your works, just to make sure you're not carrying anything. But a truly determined man can get an object quite a ways up there. 
Leonard slips a small paper-wrapped package out of the laundry bag, hides it under his apron, and keeps sorting... 
4l	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY EXCHANGE -- DAY (1947) 41 
Red deposits his dirty bundle and moves down the line to where the clean sheets are being handed out. 
RED (V.O.) That's how Andy joined our happy little Shawshank family with more than five hundred dollars on his person. Determination. 
Leonard catches Red's eye, turns and grabs a specific stack of clean sheets. He hands it across to Red -- 
TIGHT ANGLE 
-- and more than clean laundry changes hands. Two packs of cigarettes slide out of Red's hand into Leonard's. 
42	INT -- RED'S CELL -- DAY (1947) 42 
Red slips the package out of his sheets, carefully checks to make sure nobody's coming, then rips it open. He pulls out the rock-hammer. It's just as Andy described. Red laughs softly. 
RED (V.O.) Andy was right. I finally got the joke. It would take a man about six hundred years to tunnel under the wall with one of these. 
43	INT -- CELLBLOCK FIVE -- 2ND TIER -- NIGHT (1947) 43 
Brooks Hatlen pushes a cart of books from cell to cell. The rolling library. He finds Red waiting for him. Red slips the rock-hammer, wrapped in a towel, through the bars and onto the cart. Next comes six cigarettes to pay for postage. 
RED 
Dufresne.

As he slowly stands, he sees something out of the corner of his eye -- 
-- a DEAD CAT, bloody and torn, in the corner of the room.

As Suzuki backs away from it, eyes widening in horror, he's startled by -- 
MATTHEW, standing in the doorway.   Beaming at him. 
MATTHEW It's perfect. We'll take it. 
Suzuki looks back to the corner.    There's no dead cat. 
A RINGING SOUND comes into focus -- the BEEPING of a phone, waiting for someone to pick up and make the connection...

48    INT. OFFICE BUILDING - SUSAN'S FLOOR - NIGHT               48 
It's after-hours in this office space: CUBICLES fill the center, surrounded by glass-windowed OFFICES. The glittering lights of the Tokyo cityscape beyond show a hell of a view. 
One light still burns in an office towards the end -- 
-- SUSAN'S OFFICE. She's working late. She wears a phone headset while she types lines of code into her computer. 
No one's answering.   A familiar answering machine picks up: 
MATTHEW & JENNIFER (ON MACHINE) "Konnichiwa! Matt and Jennifer aren't around, leave a message." 
SUSAN (INTO PHONE) Hey, guys, it's Susan. Matt, are you there? Pick up... Okay, well, I'm leaving work now so you can try my cell, or just call me at home later. 
She pauses.   Leans back, away from the keyboard. 
SUSAN (INTO PHONE) I just wanted to make sure Mom is okay. Yesterday was... (MORE)

SUSAN (INTO PHONE) (cont'd) a bit weird, and -- I'm just a little worried. Listen, just give me a call when you can, okay? 
She hangs up, taking the headset off.   Concerned. 
49    INT. OFFICE BUILDING - 10TH FLOOR HALL - NIGHT               49 
Susan walks through the hallway. She hears a strange scraping sound -- it sounds as though something is being dragged. 
Susan turns around, but the hallway looks normal. Is it just her imagination? 
The sound starts again, coming closer. Susan gets scared and opens the door to the emergency stairwell beside her. 
49a                                                               49a INT. STAIRWELL - 10TH FLOOR - NIGHT The hallway is chilly -- Susan shivers. She's about to start walking down when she looks up, noticing THE LIGHTS at the top floor FLICKERING. 
A wind suddenly blows through the center of the stairwell with an eerie ROAR. 
Susan looks disconcerted as she starts walking down... 
Then we hear the SCRAPING SOUND again. Startled, Susan pauses and looks down, over the railing. 
There's nothing there -- but the sound continues, growing louder, like something is moving up towards her. 
SUSAN (calling out:) Is anybody there? 
Just then, the lights on the top floor finally GO OUT. 
Susan's breath catches in her throat as she looks up -- 
The lights on the next floor go out. And the next. The darkness above growing closer with each darkening floor. 
Susan nervously looks back down -- the SCRAPING is even closer. And then, for an instant, she sees A SKINNY PALE HAND on the railing two floors down. 
Terrified, Susan starts to back up -- but stops as she realizes that the darkness from above is almost upon her. 
Revisions (Blue) -- 1/26/04     32A. 
Then Susan sees A FINGERTIP of the hand at the corner of the floor where she stands, and A HEAD COVERED WITH BLACK HAIR slowly crawling up on the wall. 
Susan's mouth opens in a silent screen. With nowhere to escape, she opens the same door and rushes back into the hallway --

40   CONTINUED:   (2)                                                40 Adler moves through the door to the RV carrying Red's favorite desk chair. He's followed by BOBBY LEE, 20's, cocksure, wearing a plain khaki uniform and boots. ADLER (to Saunders) S'cuse me. (to Red) This here's Bobby Lee. He's a specialist with the Feds. They want him to tag along. Red stares hard at Bobby Lee, then nods.   Bobby Lee steps into the Airstream. SAUNDERS Please, Red, ya' gotta' believe me... Red spots Suttle, 35, bright-eyed, with a cowlick, sitting at the wheel of the Chevy truck. RED Who are you? SUTTLE Dick Suttle, the driver. RED Not anymore.   Bradley. BRADLEY, 35, glasses, moves to the truck and gets in. Suttle shrugs and steps out. Saunders stops Suttle and turns to Red. SAUNDERS This man stays with the vehicle wherever it goes, Red! RED (to Suttle) You know how to operate the gadgets? SUTTLE Yessir. RED (to Suttle) Grab a seat. Suttle sets himself in the passenger seat of the truck. Sally emerges from the building, ticked off, carrying an armload of file boxes, and makes a beeline for Red. Saunders gently touches Red's shoulders; a final plea. (CONTINUED) 
40   CONTINUED:   (3)                                               40 SAUNDERS Please Red, I'm beggin'. I mean, what am I suppose to tell the Governor? Sally arrives but before she can spit out a word... RED Tell John that Miss Gerber here checked me out on it. Red whistles and the ENGINE REVS. Red closes the door as the motor home pulls away. Saunders runs beside the passenger side window and yells in to Suttle, who stares out the window. SAUNDERS Not a scratch, you hear me, Suttle? Not a scratch! Saunders stops, breathing hard, next to Sally.   She's pissed and overloaded with files. AIRSTREAM about 20 yards down the way, comes to a stop.    A second later the door opens and the steps pop out. Sally walks toward the bus but when she arrives at the door... ... LAUGHTER filters out of the Airstream.   The Airstream moves another 20 feet then stops. Sally waits a full five seconds, then she blows the hair out of her eyes and, against her better judgment, moves cautiously forward, the file boxes getting heavier by the minute. Again, when she gets close... 
...the Airstream moves. Sally, boiling mad as her coiffure wilts in the Texas sun, stops, and tosses down the file box in anger. The Airstream stops. LAUGHTER from inside and a   few AD LIBS, i.e. -- "Okay, Okay." More LAUGHTER. Red steps    out the door, turns his gaze back inside and the laughter and  comments stop on a dime. Smiling slightly he turns to Sally,   moves straight for the file box, picks it up and walks back to  the Airstream. When he arrives at the steps he turns, looks to  Sally, who stews and holds her ground. RED You comin' or not? She hesitates only a moment before walking straight to Red, grabbing back her file box and entering in front of him. 
41   OMITTED                                                          41 42   INT. AIRSTREAM - DAY                                             42 Sally enters, balancing the   boxes, and glares at the faces surrounding her. A smiling    Red, a grinning Adler messily gorging on a cinnamon roll,   a nervous KAISER, the radio man, and, in the corner, a nasty   smirk from Bobby Lee. When the Airstream takes off again, she loses her balance and drops one of the boxes. Adler and Suttle jump forward to help but she gives them the evil eye. SALLY I've got it. She kneels down to pick it up and feels eyes on her.     She looks up to the men staring at... Her skirt, raised a bit, exposing a thigh. She calmly stands and looks to Adler, a piece of cinnamon roll dangling on his chin. SALLY You've got shit on your face. Red can't help but smile as Adler wipes at his face. 43   EXT. RURAL ROAD - DAY                                            43 The IMPALA BLASTS along, kicking up dust and dispersing crows as it heads into a one light township. It slows, however, before the main part of town and slides to a stop near a pay phone booth. 44   INT./EXT. IMPALA - DAY                                           44 JERRY Why the hell we stoppin'? BUTCH You said you had a cousin near here. JERRY So? BUTCH So give him a call. See if we can shack there til' things cool down. Jerry thinks it over, leans forward and, in one quick swipe, grabs the keys from the ignition. Then he laughs and crawls out on his way to the phone booth. (CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED:                                                   44 In the b.g. we see Jerry strut to the phone booth and pore through a thin directory. Phillip steals a glance at Butch, who watches his rear view mirror and grits his teeth. PHILLIP Why'd he take the keys? BUTCH So I won't leave him. PHILLIP (a tad hopeful) Would you leave him? BUTCH Oh yeah. In the b.g. Jerry rips the 20 page phone book in half and returns to the car, half pleased with himself. He tosses the keys to Butch, who starts the car and drives off. JERRY Musta' moved. Prolly' couldn't have heard 'em anyway. Goddam ear's still bleedin'. You ever try that shit again... BUTCH What? JERRY What? BUTCH You were in the middle of threatenin' me. JERRY (from the movies) Ain't a threat. It's a fact. Butch reaches over, takes Phillip's hand and places it on the steering wheel. BUTCH Here kid, take the wheel. Phillip, scared at the prospect, nevertheless does his best to see over the dash and keep the wheel straight. Butch turns back over the seat to confront Jerry. BUTCH In two seconds I'm gonna' break your nose. That's a threat... (CONTINUED) 
44   CONTINUED:   (2)                                             44 Before Jerry has time to snicker Butch hits him full in the face and grabs the gun. Blood spurts from Jerry's nose and the injured man cups his hands over the wound. Butch spins and retakes the wheel from a frightened Phillip. BUTCH ... And that's a fact. Instead of expressing outrage, Jerry slinks back down in the seat wearing a look of pure hatred. JERRY I'm gonna' kill you for that. 
BUTCH And that's a threat. Beginnin' to understand the difference? Somethin' catches Butch's eye and he turns and slows down and turns into... 45   EXT. RURAL STORE - DAY                                       45 The Impala brakes to a dusty stop near the front of the store, which is bordered by a giant hay field. 46   INT. IMPALA - DAY                                      46 BUTCH Okay, Phillip, listen up. I'm gonna' run in here and get some smokes. JERRY Get beer. 
Butch hands Phillip the revolver. BUTCH Here, hold it like this.... And point it right between his eyes. JERRY What the hell?... BUTCH (to Phillip) If he so much as moves you pull the trigger ... right here... Put your finger on it. Jerry snickers and then laughs maniacally. Butch reaches over and cocks the pistol. Jerry's guffaws stop on a dime. JERRY Yer' a fuckin' crazy man. (CONTINUED)

STELLA Precious or not, I don't deal with ill-gotten goods. 
CHARLIE We boosted that gold from a terrorist group that was about to trade it for bio-weapons. Now that doesn't exactly make us Robin Hood, but maybe in our own little way we were doing a good deed. Problem is, no one in my crew can handle that safe. And I need someone I can trust. 
STELLA And you think that's me? Haven't you heard that I work for the other side? 
CHARLIE What I heard is that you have your father's touch. And he was the only safecracker I knew who could open a Worthington 1000. 
STELLA I'm not a safecracker. I'm a professional safe and vault technician. 
CHARLIE You're John Bridger's daughter. And this is our chance to set things right. 
That sets her off. 
STELLA Our chance? Who do you think you are coming in here? Stealing the gold isn't going to bring my father back to life. 
CHARLIE No, it won't. 
STELLA Then get out. 
EXT. STREET Â— DAY 
Charlie comes out of her shop and starts down the sidewalk. 
Suddenly, Handsome Rob appears out of the crowd and is walking next to him. 
HANDSOME ROB How'd it go with the chick? 
CHARLIE I'm working on it. 
HANDSOME ROB I don't want her on the crew, Charlie. 
CHARLIE Gotta have her. Important piece of the puzzle. 
HANDSOME ROB There has to be someone else. What about Bill Huchins? 
CHARLIE Doing ten long at Levinworth. 
HANDSOME ROB Red O'Reilly? 
CHARLIE Chemo. 
HANDSOME ROB Martin Hernandez? 
CHARLIE Found Jesus. 
Handsome Rob stops Charlie. 
HANDSOME ROB I don't want a civilian to screw this up. 
CHARLIE She has the skill. And the motivation. 
HANDSOME ROB Exactly. She's emotional. You know what happens when emotion gets into it. 
CHARLIE It's emotional for all of us at this point. Don't kid yourself. 
INT. EXPENSIVE RESTAURANT/BAR - NIGHT 
RICHARD WORTH has his back to the bar. He's a blue blood trial lawyer with an ego that has more horsepower than a Ferrari. 
RICHARD It's all in my patented sideways glance. Like this... 
He gives a sideways glance to Stella; it's their first date. 
RICHARD I hit each woman on the jury with one of these. We make contact. And I know exactly what they're doing. Undressing me with their eyes. 
STELLA I see... 
What a nightmare. Someone bumps into Stella, a mumbled, "Excuse me." Nightmare continues... 
RICHARD The case is all but won. That's why in jury selection I choose as many women as possible. Except lesbians, of course. I can tell in sixty seconds if they're a lesbian. Want to know how I know? 
STELLA If they don't undress you with their eyes? 
RICHARD Precisely. Like that waitress right there. See? She's looking at me right below my belt. Definitely not a lesbian. 
A waitress is indeed looking below Richard's belt. But Stella notices that she was only looking because Richard's zipper is all the way down. She smiles. 
STELLA Your fly. 
RICHARD I am fly. And I'm da bomb. Just wait until later tonight.

But there's doubt in her voice.  Gale's face lights up. 
GALE You're not so sure anymore, are you? 
Sidney clams up. 
SIDNEY No, it was Cotton. 
Tatum comes waltzing up. 
TATUM (to GALE) Nice welt. 
Gale ignores her, zeroing in on Sidney, half realizing. 
GALE The killer is still on the loose, isn't he? These murders are related. 
TATUM Yo--let's rock. 
Sidney starts to fidget. 
SIDNEY I'm sorry I mangled your face. 
She take off with Tatum.  Gale calls after her. 
GALE Wait, Sidney, don't go... 
But Sidney and Tatum have already disappeared in the crowd of students moving across campus. 
Gale looks to Kenny. 
GALE Jesus Christ! An innocent man on death row. A killer still on the loose. Kenny, tell me I'm dreaming. 
KENNY You want to go live? 
Gale's mind races with possibilities. 
GALE No, not so fast. We have nothing concrete. 
KENNY When did that ever stop you? You can't sit on this. This is huge. 
GALE If I'm gonna blow this up-I need hard proof. 
KENNY But it's so much easier when we make it up. 
GALE Not this time. I owe Cotton that much. Hell, even I thought that man was guilty. 
EXT.  SCHOOL CAMPUS - SECONDS LATER 
Tatum and Sidney make their way across campus. 
TATUM Just relax. You're at school now. No one can get you here. 
SIDNEY But if it wasn't Billy it could be anybody. He could be here at school right now. 
They move up the walk as a FIGURE falls in step behind them, sporting a WHITE GHOST MASK. 
TATUM Serial killers are smart by definition. They minimize their risk. They plan and pre-calculate everything. Showing up here would be the most lame-brain move he could make. 
SIDNEY He promised me he'd be back. 
As easy as the figure appeared, it disappears-falling out of site, unseen by either of them. 
TATUM I wouldn't put too much stock in a psycho's promise. 
They move up the front steps toward the main doors of the school as the GHOST MASKED FIGURE reappears...standing at the top of the steps...Sidney sees it first, stopping dead in her tracks. 
She steps back, spinning around to find... 
A GHOST FACE behind her as well, both of them approaching, closing in on her.  Sidney starts to SCREAM when the two ghosts bust up LAUGHING, tearing off across campus. 
EXT.  STREET 
In front of the school we catch up a REPORTER doing a live remote. He holds a mask in his hand. 
REPORTER This morning several students, in what appears to be a prank, have been spotted wearing masks. School officials have yet to comment but this is the same type of mask worn by the killer... 
INT. HALLWAY - MINUTES LATER 
Just before the bell.  The hallway is congested with students heading to class.  Tatum is at her locker with Sidney. 
SIDNEY This is a mistake. I shouldn't be here. 
TATUM I want you to meet me here right after class, okay? 
Billy appears in the crowd, with Stu tagging behind.  Tatum spots him first. 
TATUM Shit, what is he doing here? 
SIDNEY I bet he's pissed. 
TATUM Just ignore him. You had good reason to think what you did. 
Billy and Stu approach.  Billy's face is solemn.

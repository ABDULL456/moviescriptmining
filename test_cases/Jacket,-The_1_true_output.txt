JEAN Can I help you? 
STARKS Hey, Jean. Nice to see you. 
JEAN looks a little confused. 
JEAN I'm sorry? Your face looks awfully familiar, I just can't quite place it... 
JACKIE Mom, this is the guy that drove us home that afternoon we were stuck on the highway. The guy you yelled at for no good reason... 
JEAN Oh, yeah. 
She gives him a once over, and, seeing how weakened he looks, decides intuitively he can't be much harm. She also notices LORENSON waiting by the car. 
JEAN There something you need? 
STARKS You could say that. 
STARKS looks at JACKIE, hesitating because of her. Sensing this, JEAN asks Jackie to leave. 
JEAN Jackie, go play in the snow. 
JACKIE Why? 
JEAN Just do it. 
JACKIE leaves and walks to the yard. STARKS watches. 
STARKS I can't stay long. [Motioning to Lorenson] That's my doctor and I gotta get back to the hospital. Everything I want to say is in this letter. [Beat] You can check as much of it as you can. 
STARKS hands her the LETTER. 
STARKS I won't be around when you read it...but I hope you believe it. It'd be a real shame if you didn't. 
JEAN looks baffled but, seeming to grasp his urgency, nods. 
STARKS [Beat] I should be on my way. 
JACKIE has been watching this exchange from the shed. When he looks over there, he catches her eye and CALLS OUT, with what strength he has left... 
STARKS Bye, Jackie. 
These are the hardest words STARKS has probably ever had to say. JACKIE just stares after him, as does JEAN, as he shows himself out. 
STARKS Happy New Year to both of you. 
JEAN Thanks. You, too. 
EXT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992 
As STARKS is walking away, we see his eyes begin to tear in the cold -- but not from it. 
INT. JACKIE AND JEAN'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992 
JACKIE abruptly runs after him. 
JACKIE Hey, wait! 
STARKS stops in his tracks; he clears as much sadness from his face as he can before he turns around to face her. 
STARKS [Beat] You be good to yourself, Jackie. 
JACKIE Ok. 
Then, suddenly, she sticks her hand for him to shake, as she did that day on the roadside; only now, it trembles slightly in the cold. 
STARKS takes JACKIE'S HAND and holds it in his own softly and affectionately. JEAN and DR. LORENSON look on curiously as STARKS looks in her face, at her hand in his, and then to the heavens for the means to get through this. 
As STARKS lets go at last, JACKIE looks back at him, sensing the connection even if she doesn't know it yet. 
STARKS turns and stumbles as he walks back to his car. LORENSON moves to help him, but STARKS tells her not to with his eyes. He makes his way to the car on his own. 
MONTAGE: 
INT. LIVING ROOM, JEAN AND JACKIE'S HOUSE, DAY, 1992 
JEAN sits down and starts to open the LETTER. Starks' voice, as we hear it now, is presumably from parts of the LETTER he's written to her. 
INT. LORENSON'S CAR, DUSK, 1992 
LORENSON looks over to STARKS, who stares painfully out the window. They drive on in silence. 
STARKS (V.O.) I was 25 years old the first time I died. It didn't end anything though. [Beat] Sometimes I think we live through things only to be able to tell them, to bear witness, to say this happened. 
INT. ALPINE GROVE, NEW YEAR'S EVE, 1992-1993 
STARKS walks back through the gates of the hospital, despondently returning inside, with LORENSON at his side. 
STARKS (V.O.) And it wasn't to someone else. It was to me. And I lived despite it. Sometimes I think we live to beat the odds. And sometimes I agree that life can only begin with the knowledge of death. That it can all end, even when you least want it to.

JOHN 
Tea. She leaves. Angela sits across from him.      They're at the table by the window. 
JOHN 
My parents sent me to a doctor, a shrink, a priest. I was in four different institutions by the time I was eighteen. Angela notes him rubbing his wrist. 
JOHN 
The last place they put me was run by a church... A DOCTOR rushes past their table.     PAN WITH him INTO... 
FLASHBACK - INT. MENTAL INSTITUTION - HALLWAY 
The Doctor rushes toward distant SCREAMING. 
JOHN (V.O.) 
The revered Father made the brilliant deduction that I was possessed, said I needed to be exorcised... 
INT. ROOM - HIGH ANGLE 
The Doctor runs in. Sees the revered Father below, leaning over a bed where an 18-year-old John is held down by three interns and that Doctor. John angrily screams at them all. 
JOHN (V.O.) 
It was like someone trying to pull teeth that weren't there. Young John clamps his eyes shut tight. 
INT. DINER - JOHN (PRESENT) 
Present-day John does the same, remembering the pain. 
JOHN 
So I took things into my own hands and I found a way out. 
ANGELA 
You attempted suicide. John sees she's looking at his wrist. The hint of a jagged scar can now be seen under the sleeve. 
JOHN 
I never attempt anything. John's reflection in the window becomes -- 
FLASHBACK - TEENAGE JOHN 
kneeling with a pair off scissors.     He's inside a... 
INT. CLASSROOM 
Teenage John looks up at a room filled with people from all walks of life. Teachers, doctors, lawyers, garbage men. All somewhat different than normal. They sit in school chairs and wait for John to do the deed. He puts the blade to his wrist -- one swipe and the world around him accelerates away in a STREAKED BLUR -- 
INT. DINER (PRESENT) 
ANGELA 
But you're still here.    Alive. 
JOHN 
Not my doing. His chest suddenly HEAVES forward -- and we're on... 
FLASHBACK - TEENAGE JOHN 
as he's jolted by DEFIB PADS.     He's in the back of a... 
INT. AMBULANCE - MOVING 
Paramedics are soaked in sweat. One looks a bit like a young Dr. Archer. Heart monitor is FLAT LINE. There's little hope. 
EXT. LOS ANGELES 
The ambulance moves through a city that is transforming. From this world's Los Angeles to a barren Hell version. 
JOHN (V.O.) 
Officially I was dead for seven minutes. But believe me, seven minutes in Hell is a lifetime. Ambulance heads toward that dying RED SUN. 
INT. AMBULANCE 
FLAT LINE on the monitor suddenly SPIKES with a pulse -- 
INT. MORGUE (PRESENT) 
Hennessey's hand jerks back from the plastic. His eyes fix on Isabel's wrist. That odd circular SYMBOL is back. Hennessey's unsettled, quickly shoves the drawer closed. He rushes out, slams right into a SECURITY GUARD coming in. 
SECURITY GUARD 
Hey, what're you doing in here? Guard looks back into the body room, sees a drawer partially open. He walks over, pulls it out further -- sees the plastic cut away. Jesus. The symbol has already faded from Isabel's wrist. 
JOHN (V.O.) 
When I returned I didn't just see demons anymore, I could do the one thing they couldn't -- come and go as I please. 
EXT. MORGUE - HENNESSEY 
runs as fast as a very obese man can -- aiming for that PHONE BOOTH on the corner. He grabs the receiver, punches numbers as fast as he can. RING -- RING -- 
RING -- 
HENNESSEY 
Be there, John... please... Something shivers up Hennessey's leg and into his body. Eyes glaze over and Hennessey settles on a RESTAURANT.

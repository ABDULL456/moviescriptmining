Frank:   Hey, hey, hey, whaddya got, whaddya got, whaddya got??  (Frank gets whopped with a shoe) (through the shoe) Shoelaces!  Oh. 
(the animals have constructed a long pole held up and together with rope and shoelaces; they begin to use their "pole" to get the keys.) 
Cody:    Almost.... a little further... 
Frank:   Yeah, yeah, yeah.  (Krebbs moans/cries as they miss the keys.) 
Cody:    It's o.k. let's try again. 
Frank:   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. 
Cody:    Easy... easy does it. 
Frank:   Yeah, no, no, no, yeah, no, yeah, yeah (etc...) 
Krebbs:  Somebody shut him up!! 
(they get the keys on the hook; the dangle right in front of the door.) 
Frank:   You've got it! You've got it!  You've got it! 
(Joanna comes in, discovers keys, destroys pole, returns keys to hook, and leaves through the animal door.) 
Frank:   (Frank strains to think again) I've got it!  I'll just take my tail.... and I'll pick the lock.... like this!! 
Red:     Aww Frank, give it a rest.

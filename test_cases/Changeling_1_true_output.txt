INT. LA COUNTY GENERAL HOSPITAL - MENTAL WARD - DAY 
Hahn marches into the receiving area with Christine Collins and Briegleb. He goes to the receiving nurse. 
NURSE Yes?   May I -- 
She sees Christine Collins and the sentence dies midway. Hahn pulls out a handful of papers. 
HAHN My name is S. S. (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                  100. 
HAHN (Cont'd) Hahn, and I have a court order for the immediate release of all women being detained in this institution under the designation Code Twelve pending a formal inquiry into the reasons for their detainment. 
NURSE I'm sorry, but the doctor in charge won't be in until tomorrow morning and -- 
HAHN Let me be clearer. Either you open those doors and produce the people named in that court order, or you will find yourself on the other side of those bars...without a key. 
The nurse exchanges a sour look with Christine and heads off. 
EXT. HOSPITAL - DAY 
One by one, the Code Twelve patients are brought out of the hospital and into the light. One of the last to emerge is Carol Dexter, who blinks against the light, and sees Christine. She runs to her, embraces her, sobbing. 
CAROL DEXTER I knew you'd come...I knew you'd come back...I knew you'd come.... 
CHRISTINE It's all right...everything's going to be all right now.... 
And in Christine's face, we see a flicker of pride and one simple truth: if she could not save her son, she could at least save these women. As they move toward her, Hahn and Briegleb, we HEAR a TRAIN WHISTLE that segues us into 
EXT. UNION STATION - TRAIN PLATFORM - DAY 
Gordon Northcott, handcuffed, is led out of a train by several officers. The waiting PRESS rush toward him. He seems to enjoy the attention. Among the shouted questions we hear: 
REPORTER Mr. Northcott, any comment on your arrest? 
GORDON I'm feeling fine. (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                                   101. 
GORDON (Cont'd) I've been on a little vacation, as some of you know. It was a pleasant vacation, and the police have certainly provided me with a lot of amusement. 
REPORTER How did you avoid capture? 
GORDON Well, I didn't, did I? Didn't know anyone wanted me until just recently. Didn't even try. My luggage still has my initials on it. 
ANOTHER REPORTER Did you know why the police were after you? 
GORDON No, but I figured it would be best if I stayed out of it. 
REPORTER Anything to say to the parents of the children you murdered? 
GORDON No comment. 
And on that the police hustle Gordon away. 
INT. CHIEF DAVIS' OFFICE - DAY 
Davis is filling out paperwork as the door opens. He looks up as LOS ANGELES MAYOR GEORGE CRYER enters, closing the door after him again. DAVIS Mayor Cryer...this is unexpected. 
CRYER So was this. 
He drops a series of court documents on Davis' desk.   He picks them up, examines them. 
CRYER Subpoenas, requests for depositions, interrogatories...all courtesy of Mr. Hahn and his new client, Christine Collins. (more) 
CHANGELING A True Story                            102. 
CRYER (Cont'd) You don't have to look them over too closely, Chief, your own copies should be arriving any time now. (beat) The City Council has also agreed to look into this, starting immediately. 
DAVIS Goddamnit.... 
CRYER I thought this was supposed to go away. This is an election year, I can't afford this kind of press. 
DAVIS It is going away, sir.   I instructed Captain Jones -- 
CRYER I'm afraid falling on his sword and saying he made a mistake isn't going to be good enough, Chief. If we take him out of the picture for a while, it might help calm things down until the hearing's finished. (beat) There are several people on the council who are planning to run against me, and they'd love to accuse me of allowing a renegade police force to operate with impunity. 
Cryer shakes his head, walks off a pace. 
CRYER Our friends in the press are having a field day with this mess. I'm getting five hundred phone calls, letters and telegrams a day demanding to know what the hell is going on at City Hall that we allow our police force to brutalize women and misplace children. Christ, all this picture needs now is for somebody to kick a puppy for the cameras. (beat) This is a train, Chief, and we need to either get in front of it, or be run over by it. 
DAVIS Mayor Cryer...I stand by my men. You know that. 
CHANGELING A True Story                                  103. 
CRYER I do. And you know where I stand. So the question is..are we going to stand together...or hang together? 
He lets the question sit as we go to 
EXT. CITY HALL - DAY 
Mayor Cryer stands beside Chief Davis and addresses a rather noisy and worked-up press corps from behind a podium. 
MAYOR CRYER Gentlemen...gentlemen, please. As Mayor of Los Angeles, it is my duty to preserve the peace in our city, which has been disrupted by recent events in the case of Christine Collins. As a result, we have decided that Captain J. J. Jones of the Lincoln Heights Division is to be suspended from active duty, effective immediately.

EXT. JACKSON HOSPITAL - DAY 
A car pulls up to the chaotic ER area.       Phil Parsons and Pete step out, rush inside. 
INT. HOSPITAL ER - MEN'S ROOM - DAY 
Sheriff Ryan is busy at the urinal. But even here he can't find any peace because Teddy Howard is on his case -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Mr. Howard -- let me simply list the events your client was involved in last night. First she drugs a janitor, steals his car and escapes a mental institution -- 
TEDDY HOWARD 
Hold on, there isn't even any substantial evidence -- 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Sheriff Ryan zips up his pants, flushes and runs the sink to wash his hands -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Mr. Howard -- there isn't evidence because the overdosed janitor hasn't woken up, that's why -- and when your client was questioned on the matter she admitted to injecting a full syringe of -- 
TEDDY HOWARD 
(handing him a paper towel) You had no right to question my client without my presence -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Mr. Howard, this is not a courtroom. Your client was read her rights and she still insisted -- 
TEDDY HOWARD 
-- Let me ask you this, Sheriff: what exactly was a janitor doing with several vials of sedatives inside my client's cell? And is it not possible he had taken some drugs himself before my client -- Sheriff Ryan discards the paper towel and walks out to the waiting room, Teddy following closely -- 
INT. ER WAITING ROOM 
Paramedics and nurses doing their thing. The young officer who arrested Miranda hands the Sheriff a cup of coffee. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
I'm not a drug expert. I'm simply stating the frigging facts. Sheriff Ryan burns his tongue on the coffee, notices Parsons and Pete approaching. Relief crosses his face. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Phil, thank God -- this guy's driving me nuts! 
PARSONS 
What happened? 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
SHERIFF RYAN 
An 'incident' -- for lack of a better frigging word -- involving Miss Grey and a teenage girl who's been tortured and is in critical condition and chances are slim she'll even utter another word. 
PETE 
Who's the girl? 
SHERIFF RYAN 
A runaway from Portland, Tracy Marie Seaver. Reported missing a couple weeks ago. We found Miss Grey in some barn off Willows Creek with the girl all messed up. I'm just now waiting for the surgeon to give me an update. (to Teddy) Notice, Counselor, how I'm not even mentioning her trespassing or lying to a police officer. Teddy waves him off in frustration.     Goes to talk to Turlington. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Christ, the woman's got the entire hospital busy -- Sheriff Ryan notices Teddy talking to Turlington -- 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Why are you harassing my deputies? 
TEDDY HOWARD 
I'm only asking him where he got the coffee -- ? 
SHERIFF RYAN 
He's not at liberty to answer that. You've had enough goddamn coffee already. The Sheriff leaves Pete and Parsons. They walk over to the water cooler where they can talk more privately. 
PETE 
We need to get Miranda back to the institute. She needs psychiatric care, not a prison cell. 
(CONTINUED) 
CONTINUED: 
Parsons nods, lost in thought.        Sheriff Ryan returns. 
SHERIFF RYAN 
Phil, how well does your wife know the suspect? 
PARSONS 
Why do you ask?

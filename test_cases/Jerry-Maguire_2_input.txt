EXT. HOUSE/WINDOW OUTSIDE LAUNDRY ROOM -- NIGHT 
Now camera starts to move around the house, from this window showing the two sisters in the laundry room, to the living room where Jerry sits alone.  We see Ray wander into the room and stare at Jerry. 
INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Jerry, who is playing with a kaleidoscope on the table, looks up to see Ray. 
RAY Hi. 
JERRY Hi Ray. 
INT. LAUNDRY ROOM -- SAME TIME 
LAUREL All I'm saying.  You don't have the luxury of falling for some drowning man.  Be practical.  Now. Which top? 
She holds up two tops.  One is sexier with a dipped down front. The other is striped, cute, functional. 
DOROTHY Okay, you want to talk about practical? Let's talk about my wonderful life. Do you know what most other women my age are doing right now? They are partying in clubs, trying to act stupid, trying to get a man, trying to keep a man... not me. I'm trying to RAISE a man. 
She grabs the sexier top, and puts it on. 
DOROTHY (continuing) I've got a 24 hour a day reminder of Roger, for the rest of my life. I have had three lovers in four years, all boring, all achingly self-sufficient all friends of yours I might add, and all of them running a distant second to a warm bath.  Look at me, Laurel, look at me.  I'm the oldest 26 year old in the world!  How do I look? 
LAUREL Good. 
DOROTHY Thanks. 
INT. LIVING ROOM -- NIGHT 
Jerry and Ray have a great conversation, playing tug with a piece of rope. 
RAY And then my dad died and my mom took me to the zoo and I love the zoo. Do you hate the zoo or do you love the zoo? 
JERRY Wait.  I want to tell you more about my dad. 
RAY Let's go the zoo. 
JERRY Okay.  I've been hogging it. You're right. (more) 
JERRY (cont'd) All my life I've been trying to talk, really talk, and no one wants to listen.  You know that feeling? 
Ray nods vigorously. 
RAY Let's go right now.  Let's go to the zoo. 
JERRY Aw, the fucking thing... I mean, the zoo is closed. 
RAY You said "fuck". 
JERRY Yeah I know.  I did. 
Ray loves this guy.  He pats Jerry's knee. 
RAY I won't tell. 
JERRY We'll go to the zoo sometime. Okay? I think I might have some time on my hands. 
Ray looks at Jerry's hands. 
RAY I don't see any. 
JERRY (points respectfully) Funny. 
RAY Funny... (imitates him) (hears mom approaching) I better go to bed. 
Ray hugs Jerry and exits.  Jerry sits contemplating the kid for a moment.  The door swings open and a harried Dorothy appears in the sexier top, but with a distinctly less sexy attitude, and a tray. 
DOROTHY Drinks.  Food.  Plus, I called you a cab. 
JERRY (slightly confused) Good idea.  Thank you. 
And we should keep our voices down a little.  I have a little boy asleep. 
JERRY (continuing) Right.  Of course. 
Jerry tries to twist open the beer, ripping at his palm. It's not a twist-off.  She hands him an opener.  He opens it, inelegantly. 
DOROTHY So.  Our company. 
She watches the drunken man, who drinks. Then coughs a little. Then stands. 
JERRY Okay.  Lil' speech before I go. 
He gets up, woozy, but loose.  Powerfully: 
JERRY (continuing) Do.  Not.  Worry.  About.  Your. Job. (beat) Our company is in good shape. You and your son... we... are just fine.  You still have a job. I want you to feel confident!  In. Me.  And I have a problem with people who talk about themselves in the third person, but let me tell you something about Jerry Maguire. 
His confidence nicely fueled, Jerry reaches for a fireplace poker. He begins to joust with an imaginary opponent.

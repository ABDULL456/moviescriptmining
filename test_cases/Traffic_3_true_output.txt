He keeps watching. 
ANNA He's saying he's going to talk to the Americans.  Become an informer. 
He says they pay a lot of money. 
JAVIER Why does he need money? 
ANNA He has debts.  He has gambling debts. He owes a lot of money. 
JAVIER How much? 
ANNA Nine thousand dollars. 
A long beat. 
JAVIER What is he planning on telling them? 
ANNA Well, you know, he's going to say about Madrigal... and Salazar. 
Javier just looks at her. 
CUT TO: 
INT. ROBERT'S OFFICE IN WASHINGTON - DAY 
Robert is on the telephone, listening.  He is not happy. Sheridan watches him. 
ROBERT (into phone) Nobody saw her leave? (beat) Yes... I understand. 
He hangs up.  He stands and reaches for his jacket. 
ROBERT I have to go.  I have to go home. 
INT. WAKEFIELD KITCHEN - NIGHT 
Robert and Barbara sit at the kitchen table. 
BARBARA Should we bring the police into this? 
ROBERT No, not yet. 
EXT. WEST END STREETS - DAY 
Robert drives through the streets in his Cadillac DeVille. 
INT. DEVILLE - DAY 
Robert rides in glum silence.  He looks at passersby who are almost all black and almost all stare back at the white man in his Cadillac. 
A group of young men stare threateningly as he rolls past. 
On the street, in the lee of a Brownstone staircase, a deal is going down. 
ROBERT AND SETH ABRAHMS - DAY 
sit in a coffee shop. 
SETH (genuinely surprised) She's not at that place you sent her? 
ROBERT She snuck away.  And we haven't seen her.  She hasn't come home. 
SETH Oh, man -- 
ROBERT She hasn't called you? 
SETH I tried to talk to her when she was up there, but they wouldn't put me through. (beat) I'm surprised she hasn't called. 
ANOTHER ANGLE ON ROBERT IN THE CAR - DAY 
He turns a corner and is suddenly in a drive-thru drug market. Dealers, HUSTLERS, run at the windows from both sides, signaling. 
HUSTLERS What you want?  Rock?  Rock?  Hey, what you want? 
ROBERT AND SETH - DAY 
in the coffee shop. 
ROBERT Can you tell me anything?  Do you have any ideas? 
SETH I don't know what to say. 
ROBERT I'm not the police.  I don't care about experimentation.  She's a kid. I'm worried to death. 
SETH You won't say anything to my parents? 
ROBERT I don't give a fuck about your parents -- 
SETH We sometimes went downtown to score. 
ROBERT What? 
SETH The West End.  We buy it off the streets. (beat) I can stop, you know, and she can't. Two people, really similar, we can talk about anything, but for me it's like a weekend thing, then I get my shit together, and for her it's different -- 
ROBERT You don't know what the hell you're talking about.  You're a cocky seventeen year-old and you don't have a clue what the stakes are. You don't know the value of the life you've yet to throw away.  And neither does she. 
ROBERT IN HIS CAR - DAY 
It is surrounded.  Robert stares.  A face presses up against the window. 
FACE (through the window) What do you want? 
ROBERT (through the window) What do you mean, what do I want? 
FACE Rock or dope, man?

It features a \ndark Hawaiian beauty holding a softball sized sea shell.  The shell juts out of the display giving it a 3-D quality. \nAVIS Morning Mr. Barnell.  Coffee? \nPAUL Thanks Avis.  Looks good. \nPaul, shivering, hangs up his coat as Avis picks up a promotional Aloha Air surfboard (the old display) and walks it to the back. \nPAUL (cont'd) Was November this bad last year? \nAVIS (O.S.) Well if we didn't have the weather what would we talk about?  Did you send the computer back? \nPaul moves to his desk. \nPAUL Yeah, it was not working.  Any calls? \nAVIS (O.S.)

No.  I mean, they said he hadn't been gone long enough. \nAVIS (smiling warmly) Good thing in hindsight. \nPaul puts the mail down on the desk and start to flip through it.  Lots of bills, most marked past due.  He finds a \"pre- approved\" credit card application, sets it to one side. \nAVIS (cont'd) So where was he all these years? \nPAUL Lower 48.

I'll get my purse. \nThe paperboy, unfazed, smiles as Margaret walks off. \nPAPERBOY It's 12 dollars.  I missed you last time. \nMARGARET (O.S.) Jerk off... OK, jerk off, uhhuh... \nMargaret gives the paperboy his money, the stamp card plus a dollar tip, then tweaks his nose.

Are you really sure they're going to do this other thing? \nPAUL I'm... I... I don't know.  He said some things.  He said he was joking, but I... I think he might. \nTIFFANY Don't think, know.

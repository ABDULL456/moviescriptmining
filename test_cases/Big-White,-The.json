{"train": "THE BIG WHITE \nWritten by \nCollin Friesen \nFADE IN: \nEXT. ROAD - WINTER DAY \nA police car, nothing more than a speck on the landscape, is intermittently visible through the blowing snow. \nINT. POLICE CAR - SAME \nA CORPORAL (20s), behind the wheel, with a bored DETECTIVE BOYLE (60s) at his side. \nCORPORAL So his hand is like, off, right.  So he puts on a tourniquet, puts the hand in his pocket, walks five miles through the bush til he gets to the highway, where he passes out, on the road, right.  Then this logging truck comes along... \nDETECTIVE BOYLE (looking ahead) Hey. \nThe Corporal looks forward. \nCAR'S POV: Through the windshield of a WOMAN (40s), dressed in her pajamas and a parka, skipping down the middle of the road. \nEXT. ROAD \nThe police car pulls to a stop, just as the woman does a pirouette and falls over backwards. \nDetective Boyle and the other Cop get out and walk over. \nCORPORAL (into his radio) Dispatch, this is unit 611, we need a first responsder -- \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Cancel that. \nThe Woman kicks up a leg, wiggles her foot. \nDETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd) I know where she belongs. \nAs they lift her up... \n1     INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - LATE AFTERNOON                                  1 \nThe dumpster lid opens on a bitterly cold, gray winter's day in an Alaskan city.  A chunky, shivering HAIR STYLIST with jet black bangs shakes out a box of conditioning samples. \nHAIR STYLIST (to someone O.S.) She says \"I haven't eaten all day,\" then, right there on the bus she pulls out this, like, salmon steak and I'm... \n2     INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - LATE AFTERNOON                                  2 \nThe dumpster lid BANGS shut, reopens a beat later. A moment of calm until two garbage bags SLAM against the inside of the lid. It falls shut with a CLANG. \n3     EXT. TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT                                                    3 \nThe lid reopens. Night time now, as a street lamp BUZZES to life. A middle aged MAN in work clothes checks to make sure he's alone. He gently lowers the lid, opens it again a moment later, this time balancing a mini-bar fridge on his shoulder.  He dumps the appliance into the bin and runs off. \n4     INT. INSIDE A TRASH DUMPSTER - NIGHT                                           4 \nThe lid reopens.  SIRENS off in the distance... \nMEN'S VOICES (O.S.) One, two, three... up. \nThe lifeless body of a fair-sized man comes CRASHING into the garbage. SIRENS closer.  A man seen only in silhouette leans in to pull some garbage over the corpse.  A second man looks in, then pulls the first man away. \nMAN'S VOICE We'll get him later.  C'mon. \nThe lid drops. \n5     EXT. TRASH DUMPSTER - MORNING                                                  5 \nBlack.  The dumpster reopens. Morning now. A Korean-American  TEENAGER wearing an apron and headphones sings along to an  old KISS tune as he deposits two large orange garbage bags. \nTEENAGER \"...Get up, everybody's gonna move their feet, get down, everybody's gonna leave their seat...gonna lose your mind in...\" \nHe shuts the lid with care.  Black. \n6     EXT. CITY STREET - DAY                                                         6 \nA cookie-cutter subdivision.  Old pine trees poke through the snow cover that blankets the neighborhood.  HOWARD (30s), a burly outdoors type, is trying to unload a new snowmobile from the back of his pickup.  TED WATTERS (late 20s) half hidden under a heavy dress coat, walks down the street. He stops by Howard's driveway. \nTED Need a hand? \nHOWARD (turning) Yeah.  Could ya grab me those two by eights? \nTED By move on you mean...? \nBRANCH ...cash in Raymond's policy. \nTed smiles to himself. \nPAUL I just thought, well, it's pretty unlikely he's still alive. My Dad always wanted us to be able to look after each other if anything should ever happen.  And to be frank, money's a little -- \nTED I understand Mr. Barnell, but here's the thing. With no actual body, under Alaskan statutes a person must be missing for seven years before he or she can be legally declared dead and that's not withstanding an investigation period where concerned parties can take up to another year to file interventions concerning the motion.  So, even though your brother's status is undetermined at this point, there's really very little we can do for you. \nTed flips the file shut.  Case closed.  Branch, not entirely happy with Ted's demeanor, forces a smile. \nBRANCH Of course we are extremely sorry for your loss. \nBranch looks at Ted.  Ted turns to Paul. \nTED Oh, absolutely. \n11    EXT.  STRIP MALL - NIGHT                                                      11 \nThe city skyline rises in the distance as heat vents belch steam against the rapidly setting sun.  But that's miles away.  Here on the outskirts is a rapidly failing five store strip mall; a \"Porn-a-copia\" XXX Video store, hair stylist, small engine repair shop, fish and chips joint and the \"Barnell Great Escapes\" travel agency.  We might notice a big trash dumpster in the corner.  Paul's car, a Ford Taurus, pulls onto the parking pad. \n12    INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                  12 \nPaul driving, talking on his cell phone and balancing a big non-spill metallic travel coffee mug at the same time. \nPAUL Hang on, hang on.  First off, how did you get my cell number?  (Beat)  Because it's for mechanical and medical emergencies only. \nPaul, wound up, taps his brakes too hard.  His mug falls, the lid pops and the coffee proceeds to soak a stack of papers. \nPAUL (cont'd) Great. (back into phone) No, I'm not...  I just... give me a second here. \nPaul parks his car, gathers the soggy papers and gets out. \n13    EXT. STRIP MALL                                                               13 \nPaul, still on the phone, carries the papers to the dumpster. \nPAUL Yes, and that check went out a week ago.  I watched my secretary write it up. \n14    EXT. INSIDE THE DUMPSTER                                                      14 \nBlack.  Paul opens the lid.  The phone is cradled in his neck, he checks each soggy page to make sure he's not tossing anything important. \nPAUL Well I don't know.  I, I, I have no clue.  Could it possibly be a problem on your end?  So the electric company never makes a...  Look, I pay my bills.  I'm a Rotarian for goodness -- \nPaul looks over to see some MEN from Rodney's Repo Ranch walking up to the front door of his office.  Distracted for a moment, the phone slips and falls into the trash. \nPaul, muttering, leans in to get it.  He pushes aside an orange garbage bag, guided by the faint sound of the other person STILL TALKING. And then-- \nPAUL'S POV: of THE BODY-- a 40-ish White (well, a little blue) male dressed in a cheap suit.  Paul's phone lies across the corpse's mouth, like the dead guy is talking. \nTHE CELL PHONE Mr. Barnell?  Mr. Barnell? \n15    EXT. PARKING AREA / STRIP MALL                                                15 \nA SHOUT as Paul jumps back from the dumpster. The lid CRASHES down as he scrambles/slides away.  He takes a moment to compose himself, then realizes his phone is still in there. \nHe opens the dumpster lid and very quickly reaches in, grabs his cell and hurries off.  The lid CRASHES shut. \nPAUL (into the phone) Hello? \nHung up.  Paul dials 911, looks back at the dumpster, thinks for a second, then hits END.  He stands there, thinking. \nA15   INT. \"BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL\" - LATER                                  A15 \nPaul back in his office, staring out the window with a perfect view of the dumpster.  He can't take his eyes off it. \nBehind him, the Repo-Men are picking up a newish computer monitor and walking toward the door.  He's oblivious. \nAt the sound of a TRUCK, his head snaps around.  It's a garbage truck, but instead of heading to the dumpster, it rumbles past on the road.  That's all it takes. \nB15   EXT. PARKING AREA / STRIP MALL - MOMENTS LATER                               B15 \nPaul backs his Ford Taurus up to the dumpster, pops the trunk, checks to make sure he's alone then steps up on the rear bumper, opens the lid and clambers inside. \n16    INT. INSIDE A FRIDGE - LATER                                                  16 \nBlack.  The fridge door opens, the light revealing several cans of pop and beer in the foreground.  Behind the \nbeverages, a garage where Paul struggles with the lifeless body.  He props the man against the hood of his car, gives him a quick once over, pockets, obvious wounds.  Nothing. \nTIFFANY No, but I did crack that code problem.  You know how sometimes when you're running Beta versions you -- \nTED English, please. \nTIFFANY There was a boo-boo, but I fixed it. (another call comes in) Psychic Pals, how are you today, Carol?  Now I thought we'd agreed God is everywhere, but not specifically in your coffee pot. \nTED Jeez, Tiff. \nTIFFANY Jeez, Ted.  Do I tell you how to do your job? \nTED (kidding... kind of) No, but then again I'm not a computer aided pseudo psychic, so if you're looking for moral equivalence... \nTIFFANY Before you say anything else that may keep us from having sex ever again, let me ask you something... \nShe picks up her magazine. \nTED Tiff, please.  I always get these wrong. \nTIFFANY That's why we keep trying.  Now, Love is Sacrifice test. (reading) If you were in a life raft with me and there was only enough water -- \nTED Don't you have a customer? \nTIFFANY (to the caller) Carol?  God says he's busy with a famine right now, but you should keep praying.  Cool. \nShe hangs up.  Turns back to Ted, about to pick up where she left off... \nTED No.  I'm not doing it. \nTIFFANY It's just a stupid quiz. \nTED Exactly. \nThe PHONE RINGS.  Tiffany bolts to her desk, sits, spins in her chair as she answers the call. \nTIFFANY Psychic Pals.  Is this the first time you've called us Mrs...? \nTiffany at her computer, enters the name \"Margaret Barnell\" into her database. Tiffany works a \"mute\" button as she points back to the magazine. \nTIFFANY (cont'd) But stupid quizzes can be illustrative of potential relationship problems. (to her caller) Margaret, I'm getting the feeling this is an anxious day for you. \nTed, cooking pot in hand, walks over to her desk. \nTED Our only relationship problem is you're running a $1.99 a minute carny scam out of my living room. \nTIFFANY Don't call it a scam. (to the caller - startled) Excuse me? \nTED What? \nTIFFANY You've got to learn to channel that rage, Margaret. (to Ted - playful) You didn't just call this your living room, did you? \nTED I meant ours.  Ours, ours, ours. \nTiffany returns to her call, but keeps looking at Ted. \nTIFFANY I feel someone you really care about, maybe even the love of your life, is being a real pain.  Now I need you to concentrate... \nTed pretends to do just that, drawing a giggle from Tiffany before he walks off. \n22    INT. \"BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL\" - MORNING                                 22 \nPaul tries to open the front door, but finds it blocked by a small pile of snow. Three good yanks and it finally opens. He enters the shop. \nFaded travel posters cover the walls.  AVIS (40s), a career office gal, smiles at her boss as she assembles a life-size stand-up cardboard display for Aloha Airlines.  It features a \ndark Hawaiian beauty holding a softball sized sea shell.  The shell juts out of the display giving it a 3-D quality. \nAVIS Morning Mr. Barnell.  Coffee? \nPAUL Thanks Avis.  Looks good. \nPaul, shivering, hangs up his coat as Avis picks up a promotional Aloha Air surfboard (the old display) and walks it to the back. \nPAUL (cont'd) Was November this bad last year? \nAVIS (O.S.) Well if we didn't have the weather what would we talk about?  Did you send the computer back? \nPaul moves to his desk. \nPAUL Yeah, it was not working.  Any calls? \nAVIS (O.S.) Just that fellow from Municipal Power and Electric.  I told him you sent the check in weeks ago, but some people don't like to listen. \nGARY (cont'd) So how'd it feel?  I mean, not when you did it, but, like now? \nJIMBO I don't want to talk about it. \nGary hops inside as his actions become more frantic.  Still no luck.  He stands. \nGARY Not here. \nJimbo glares at his partner. \nGARY (cont'd) Serious.  He's gone.  Maybe he wasn't... \nJIMBO Don't even joke.  Maybe the trash was emptied. \nGARY Looks pretty full.  Hey... (ducking down) There's a little fridge down here. (standing) If we would have shot him at least we'd know for sure. \nJIMBO I was following orders.  And if you hadn't started a screaming match, no one would have called the cops and we wouldn't have had to dump his -- \nGARY Fine.  Sorry. \nJIMBO Fine. \nGARY I'm just saying... maybe you didn't break it all the way. \nJIMBO (walking away) It was broken. \nGARY I'm just saying... maybe it was like hypothermia and he just looked dead. \nJIMBO It - was - BROKEN! \nGary, embarrassed, digs in the trash with his feet. \n25    INT. GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                                                      25 \nMargaret, still in her bathrobe, walks to the fridge.  As she puts her hand on the latch, she notices the pile of pop cans on the floor. \nShe tugs on the door.  It opens just a crack before the chain stops it.  The frozen head peeks through the slight gap. \nMargaret SIGHS, tries to push the fridge door closed, but the body is in the way. She gives the door a hip check.  The door latches shut while something frozen and brittle inside CRACKS.  Margaret, oblivious, walks away. \n26    INT. KITCHEN OVEN                                                             26 \nA chicken sits in a pan, the rest of the room visible behind it through the oven door window. \nMARGARET (O.S.) Paul?  Why is the fridge in the garage chained shut? \nPAUL How's my Angel tonight? \nMARGARET Blow me.  Dinner's almost ready.  You feel like some wine?  I feel like some wine. \nPaul walks to the oven, opens the door and pats the chicken.  Stone cold. \nPAUL Sweetie, here's a crazy thought... I don't feel like chicken tonight, why don't we order in? \nMARGARET Fuck it, okay. \nPAUL There's actually something we need to talk about. It's about Raymond.  He's back. \nPaul smiles bravely as he shuts the oven door.  Behind the chicken, Margaret doesn't look happy as Paul starts to explain.  She rushes from the room. \n27/28 TIGHT ON: TV SCREEN                                                        27/28 \nHome video of RAYMOND (then early 30s), fat, physically imposing and the only person not in festive tropical gear, standing in a VFW hall decorated in a Caribbean theme. (He is definitely not the same person Paul has cooling in the fridge.)  A large banner behind him proclaims \"HAPPY 10TH ANNIVERSARY - BON VOYAGE.\" \nRAYMOND (a little drunk) Okay, I never thought it would last this long, but seeing as how it has... There ya go.  Let me just say that my brother, old \"Puddles McBarnesy\" did better than he should have. \nA younger, somewhat tipsy Paul comes into frame, puts an arm around his brother and smiles. \nPAUL What'cha saying there Raymond?  Wha'cha saying 'bout me? \nRaymond shakes his brother's arm off his shoulder. \nRAYMOND Enough, OK? \nPAUL (sing-songy) Ray's a little jeallllllllous.  This is the one that got away, right Ray? \nThe crowd LAUGHS as Paul reaches over and musses up his brother's hair. Raymond, furious, grabs his brother by the lapels and throws him roughly to the floor.  The laughter stops. \nMARGARET (O.S.) Leave him alone, ball licker! \nRAYMOND And shut that thing -- \nBehind them on the hill, Gary tries to retrieve his nephew's Snowrider from the Bully.  He is failing. \nDAVE Show me what?  An empty trash dumpster?  It was supposed to look like an accident.  I was hoping to see it in the paper.  So help me, if this guy pops up somewhere... \nWhile Jimbo does his best to stay warm, behind him on the hill, Gary can only watch as the Bully slides away. \nBULLY (echoing in the cold) Fag!  Big homo! \nJIMBO He won't.  He can't.  He's -- \nDAVE Proof, Jimbo.  I like to know my money's well spent. You got a week. \nDave drives off as Gary walks over with his SNIFFLING nephew. \nGARY Slippery little sucker.  You mind if we stop at a toy store on the way back? \n33    OMITTED                                                                       33 \nA 33  INT.

Margaret takes up more than her share of the bed, her arm tossed over her husband.  Paul, on his third of the bed, looks as if he's lying in state. But Paul's not sleeping. \n34    EXT.  BARNELL HOME - MORNING                                                  34 \nA newspaper clears the \"For Sale - price reduced!\" sign on the front lawn and lands with a THUD on the steps. \n35    INT.  GARAGE - CONTINUOUS                                                     35 \nPaul has the \"Morning News\" on the hood of his car.  He looks over at the fridge, still padlocked. \nPAUL (to himself) Let's see if anyone's missing you. \nHe flips through each section.  There's nothing.  Paul walks to the fridge. \nPAUL (cont'd) (to the corpse) I don't know what kind of man let's himself just freeze to death in the trash, but I was never one to preach.  Way I see it, you've probably got family somewhere and they'd probably appreciate seeing you get a decent funeral, even if it's not really... yours. \nPaul, somewhat befuddled, gently pats the fridge door. \n36    OMITTED                                                                       36 \n37    INT. BARNELL HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATER                                       37 \nMargaret pushes the vacuum across the floor, humming to herself.  Paul walks by slipping into his coat.  He notices that the vacuum isn't plugged in.  Without missing a beat, he walks over and plugs it into the outlet.  The VACUUM ROARS TO LIFE.  Margaret doesn't flinch.  Paul heads out the door. \n38    OMITTED                                                                       38 39    OMITTED                                                                       39 \n40    EXT.

Only two houses on this turn-out; a cozy looking lived in cabin sits up the road from a seemingly deserted rundown mobile home.  A car pulls up. \nA40   INT. PAUL'S CAR - CONTINUOUS                                                 A40 \nPaul adjusts a pillow he has taped to his stomach, then pulls on a blue ski mask. \n41    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - MOMENTS LATER                                      41 \nPaul undoes the bungee cord and drags his snowblower out of the trunk.  He fires up the snowblower and starts to plow the drive way of both houses. \nMRS. WHERRY (80s), in her bathrobe, looks out the window of the cozy cabin. A tad confused, she waves to the man in the blue parka.  The blue parka waves back. \n42    INT.  PAUL'S KITCHEN - NIGHT                                                  42 \nPaul walks in from the garage, pulling off his blue parka.  Margaret enters from the living room.  (Paul still has the pillow taped to his front, which Margaret happily pokes with a finger but never mentions.) \nMARGARET (nervous) He's not here, is he? \nPAUL Sweetie, don't you worry about Raymond. \nMARGARET When he's around, it just brings back... Fuck. \nPAUL I know.  He, he said he's probably gonna head back down South soon. \nMargaret smiles, relieved.  The phone RINGS.  Paul picks up. \n43    INT. MRS.

WHERRY Paul?  Thank you so much for clearing the drive way. That was most considerate. \nPAUL I'm afraid I don't understand Mrs. Wherry. \nPaul drapes the steaks on the body, tucking one under an arm, the other hanging from a pocket. He pauses for moment, then pulls out a container of lard and, fighting his own revulsion, smears it across the dead man's face. \nPAUL Sorry about this part. \nPaul pats the body on the shoulder, then looks up at the ridge and the long journey ahead. \n58    EXT. BOTTOM OF RIDGE  - NIGHT                                                 58 \nA WOLF appears in the moonlight.  Followed by another, and another.  They approach the corpse... \n59    EXT. HIGHWAY TURNOUT / CLEARING - DAY                                         59 \nSnowmobiles SCREAM to the site as people tramp through the thick snow, covering all of Paul's hard work.  An ambulance and State Conservation vehicles pack the area where Paul first pulled off.  Yellow police tape is strung between fir trees marking a path toward the ridge. \n60    EXT. BOTTOM OF RIDGE  - DAY                                                   60 \nThe corpse is covered with a tarp.  The area is littered with blood, animal tracks and bits of blue parka.  POLICE OFFICERS and tough looking LOCAL SNOWMOBILERS mill about the corpse, taking turns lifting the tarp that covers the body.  A few yards away, DETECTIVE BOYLE (60s) talks to a seemingly distraught Paul. \nDETECTIVE BOYLE (looking at the ridge) If it's any comfort to you, he likely wasn't eaten while conscious.  Did he say where he'd been living, before he came home? \nPAUL Florida.  He didn't really talk about it much.  He brought us this shell. \nPaul holds up a sea shell, obviously from the display at his office.  Tears well up in his eyes. \nPAUL (cont'd) It's really all we have left.  He'd been gone for five years.  We'd given him up-- \nDETECTIVE BOYLE --for dead, yes sir. \nPAUL How did you...? \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Anonymous phone tip from some Jamaican guy. (Paul shows no reaction) Said he saw what looked like a body.  We tracked you through his ID. \nPAUL Just like on TV. \nBoyle nods sympathetically \nPAUL (cont'd) I've got to see him.  Please. \nPaul starts to make his way to the body.  Boyle stops him. \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Mr. Barnell,  I should warn you, an animal  attack isn't pretty.  There's not much left. \nPaul nods.  They make their way over to the tarp.  Boyle pulls it back. \nDETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd) Is that your brother, sir? \nPaul leans in-- the man's face is hamburger.  Paul nods. \nPAUL They chewed his ears off.  What kind of animal does something like that? \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Normally I'd say bear, but these tracks and the feeding pattern indicate wolf.  It's rare, but it can happen. \nBoyle pulls the cover back over the body. Boyle hands Barnell a clear baggie with the dead man's wallet inside. \nDETECTIVE BOYLE (cont'd) Your brother's personal effects.  We've got some people with the victim's assistance program who can help you through this.  Marcie? \nMarcie, a female police officer, walks a distraught Paul away.  As they go, another FEMALE COP approaches. \nFEMALE COP Coroner found some smaller bite marks on the ankle. \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Pups.  Must have been the whole freakin' pack. \nFEMALE COP You want an autopsy? \nDETECTIVE BOYLE On what? \nFEMALE COP Derek found this. \nShe holds up a clear evidence bag with the remnants of a strip of bacon on the inside. \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Not the smartest snack for a hiker. \nFEMALE COP Messy animals aren't they? \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Messy.

The sound of clubs SMACKING golf balls echo as an intense Ted \"waggles\" before his shot. On his back-swing, Tiffany throws her arms around him from behind. \nTED I take it you're done? \nTED Would it surprise you to learn his brother tried to cash in his policy two weeks ago? \nDETECTIVE BOYLE You trying to tell me Mr. Barnell chewed off his brother's leg? \nTED Doesn't that make you the least bit suspicious? \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Mr. Watters, this is a nice simple ending.  We like nice simple endings. \nTED But shouldn't you-- \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Ya know, I don't know thing one about insurance, but I'm guessing it's your job to find a way not to pay these poor people. \nCAM Hey now, we're just like you guys, gotta run down whatever leads we can find. \nTed walks down to the head of the victim, pulls out a camcorder and starts to tape the body. \nTED Detective, we're an insurance company, not the Salvation Army. \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Mind telling me what you're doing? \nCAM They gave every claims team a video camera last quarter... you'd be amazed at how it cuts down on litigation.  We had this case two months ago where this mother of six was claiming... \nDETECTIVE BOYLE I've got my own war stories, thanks.  You mind stopping that? \nTED Just doing -- \nDETECTIVE BOYLE Your job?  Yes, I caught that. \nAs Ted gets his last shot, Boyle covers the body back up and slides the drawer shut with a loud CLANG.  Black. \n63    EXT. PAUL'S HOUSE - SUNSET                                                    63 \nTV NEWS CAMERA POV: Of Paul, standing on his stoop, as he's interviewed by a well made-up female TV REPORTER (20s) dressed for the cold. \nTV REPORTER You ready Mr. Barnell? \nPAUL Yes. \nThe camera man flicks on his light as Paul squints. \nTV REPORTER The police told us what happened, how are you folks holding up? \nMARGARET (O.S.) Paul?  Who's out there? \nPaul reaches back, and, as discretely as possible, grabs the door handle to keep Margaret from opening it. \nPAUL Obviously, my wife's very upset... \nMARGARET (O.S.) Paul, the door's stuck! \nMargaret starts to HAMMER rhythmically on the door. \nPAUL (ignoring her) It's been a tough, you know, when something like this happens you just have to ask yourself... \nMARGARET (O.S.) Who fucked with the fucking door! \nPAUL You can see how stressful it's been, I should really go now.  We have to plan a service. \nAnd with that, Paul opens his front door and ducks inside, quickly shutting it behind him. \n64    INT. BRANCH'S OFFICE - DAY                                                    64 \nBranch, very unhappy, flips through some papers then looks up at Ted and Cam. \nTED This isn't a standard case.  You were there when this guy came in looking to cash in.  C'mon, it stinks. \nBRANCH Secondly, if the police say this guy was... \nCAM Eaten by wolves.  Sir. \nBRANCH (incredulous) Eaten by wolves, then we've got no case.  Did you see Mr. Barnell on the news last night?  Last thing we need is bad P.R.  I don't want this thing Valdeez-ing on us. \nTED Mr. Branch, I'm sure head office would take a rather dim view of our -- \nBRANCH Corporate's view will be whatever I tell them. \nCam, seeing his partner is about to get himself into a heap of trouble, hustles him toward the door. \nCAM Yes Sir.  Color us called off, as of now. \n65    INT. INSURANCE OFFICE - MOMENTS LATER                                         65 \nJIMBO Yeah, \"Sorry.\"  I get strip searched and you go off playing snow angels... \nRADIO HOST (O.S.) Well, we've got one now, don't we!? \nWOMAN CALLER (O.S.) That was different. From what I read in the paper he was unconscious. And now people are going to use this as an excuse to-- \nRADIO HOST (O.S.) Hey lady, why don't you tell Raymond Barnell how wolves have gotten a bad rap. \nWOMAN CALLER (O.S.) I can tell you from years of experience that wolves do not operate-- \nJIMBO Wait a minute. \nRADIO HOST (O.S.) You can tell me all you want, lady, but it is an undeniable, indisputable fact.  This Barnell guy got turned into a Scooby Snack by a pack of wild animals... \nJIM'S POV: Through the windshield, looking at the sign for \"Barnell Great Escapes Travel.\"  Jimbo and Gary look at each other. Maybe... \n68    INT. INSURANCE OFFICE - DAY                                                   68 \nTed at his cubicle on his phone. \nTED Yeah, hi, it's Ted Watters from Fidelity Mutual. (beat) I need a complete credit work up on a Raymond Barnell... and Paul, a Paul Barnell too... sure, I'll hold. \nCam walks by, leans his head over the top of the cubicle. \nCAM You start the month ends yet? \nTED Can you take care of it?  I'm kinda... working on something. \nCAM Oh God, you're not still on the Barnell thing are you-- \nTed pulls Cam down into his cubicle, talks in a harsh whisper. \nTED I went to see him. \nCAM And?  Then?  So? \nTED Trust me. Something's not right.  I can smell it.  Help me buy a week. \nCAM We're gonna get in such trouble. \nTED I promise from now on you can come along on everything. \nCAM No more Cam goes to the coffee room and Ted disappears for three hours? \nTED I'll try. \nCAM And you'll work on your interpersonal skills? \nTED (a long beat) Yes. \nCAM Good.  Now if you'll excuse me, I'll go start covering your ass. \n69    INT. BARNELL HOME / STUDY - EVENING                                           69 \nPaul sits beside his desk, flipping through travel brochures. Margaret enters, teetering in the doorway.  Paul looks up. \nPAUL Hey.  How's my Princess? \nMARGARET OK.  I took some Adavan.  And called my psychic. \nPAUL (picks up the phone bill) Honey, you know how expensive that is.  I thought we agreed that... \nShe moves to him, runs her hand through his hair. \nMARGARET Don't be mad.  It's just... this week has been so... well with Raymond getting eaten by animals and someone trying to steal the fridge. \nPAUL I know.  Why don't you -- \nMARGARET We got another letter from the HMO today. \nPAUL Have you opened it yet? \nMargaret starts to CRY, holding the letter up to her face the SOBS building to a full blown breakdown. \nPAUL (cont'd) Oh hey honey, come on now. \nMARGARET I'm sorry.  It's just, fucking cocksuckers. \nPaul takes the letter, unfolds it and reads... \nPAUL \"As we have stated previously... usual onset before the age of 18... coupled with no genetic history...\" \nGARY Yeah.  Maybe. (a possible idea) You see the whirlpool tub? \nJIMBO You can't be serious. \nGARY It could be like a little getaway. \nOff Jimbo, considering this. \n83    EXT. BARNELL HOME - NIGHT                                                     83 \nPaul pulls up, hits the garage door opener and drives in. \n84    INT. BARNELL HOME / KITCHEN                                                   84 \nPaul walks in from the garage, pulls off his jacket. \nPAUL Hey Maggie-magster.  How ya -- \nPaul stops short as he sees Margaret, Gary and Jimbo sitting around the table. Margaret's mouth is taped shut. \nPaul is about to lunge at the men when Gary slides his gun into view.  He stops. \nPAUL (cont'd) What are you people doing in my house? \nGARY Mr. Barnell.  You have something that belongs to us. \nPAUL I, I don't know what you're talking about. \nJIMBO Do you remember a dead man you found in the dumpster behind your office? \nPaul, shocked, tries to hold it together. \nPAUL No, I can't say that... I mean that would probably stick in my mind a... dead body. \nGARY Think hard Mr. Barnell. \nHe tosses the frozen lock of hair onto the table. \nGARY (cont'd) Think hard. \nPaul realizes he's screwed, gestures to the living room. \n85    INT. BARNELL HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATER                                       85 \nGary sits on the sofa as Paul paces. \nGARY I thought it might be some weirdo sex thing, ya know?  But you look like a pretty straight arrow.  So then I'm thinking, maybe it's a scam.  Maybe somehow our friend is worth some money to you. \nPaul face lets Gary know he's dead on. \nGARY (cont'd) So what'd you collect? \nPAUL We, we had a life insurance policy on my brother.  It was for... 100,000 dollars. \nGARY You know, it's always you quiet guys.  Here's how it's going to work.  We stay here with your wife, you go get our guy. \nPAUL Here? \nGARY We even see you or a cop even roll past, she's dead. Plus you'll have to explain how you scammed the insurance people out of their hard earned money.  We'll call you in three days. Have the body and, let's say 50,000 dollars for our trouble.  Screw with us, we start mailing your wife back to you. \nGary pauses for dramatic effect. \nGARY (cont'd) Starting with her feet. \n86    INT.

Really scared. \nJIMBO You used the feet thing, didn't you? \nGARY No. \n87    INT. TED'S APARTMENT - NIGHT                                                  87 \nTiffany comes through the door carrying a sack of groceries. \nMARGARET Oh, I'm faking it?  Is this how you get your kicks, you over-compensating pussy little fart sack? \nGary, suddenly tense, puts down his spoon and picks up his gun. \nGARY Hey!  Keep your voice down or the gag goes back. \nMARGARET You don't scare me.  If something bad was going to happen, my psychic would have told me. \nGary awkwardly chambers a round, starts gesturing with the gun, trying to look tough. \nMARGARET (cont'd) You put that down now you little bitch, or so help me, I'll start yelling so loud you'll have to shoot me. \nGary, confused and embarrassed, doesn't know what to do. \n89    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - NIGHT                                              89 \nPaul gets out of his car carrying a K-Mart bag.  He looks like he's been CRYING.  Mrs. Wherry waves from her deck. \nMRS. WHERRY Paul, sorry to hear about your brother. (Paul gives a sad smile) You moving in? \nPAUL Just for a bit. \nMRS. WHERRY She'll come to her senses.  They always do.  Oh, the septic lines are frozen, so you'll have to use the outdoor commode. \nPaul waves as he enters the mobile home, closing the door behind him.  A light goes on.  It starts to snow. \n90    INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - NIGHT                                              90 \nPaul walks in, survey's the interior of the mobile home. \nPAUL'S POV:  A 7 year old time capsule of a party that was never cleaned up; beer bottles, ashtrays and general garbage. \nPAUL (to himself) Would it have killed you to clean up before you left, Raymond? \nPaul picks up a small box from the floor, looks at the label.  Edible Panties.  He puts them on top of a stack of porno mags, neatens the pile, then heads out. \nINT. BEDROOM - LATER \nHIGH ANGLE ON: Paul lying in bed, wide awake, but in the same position we've seen him in when he sleeps with Margaret.  An electric heater glows beside him. \n91    EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - CONTINUOUS                                         91 \nTIGHT ON: Car tires as they pull to a stop on the main road.  A pair of heavy men's boots get out, start to make their way toward the mobile home. \n92    INT. MOBILE HOME - LATE NIGHT                                                 92 \nThere's a KNOCK on the door.  Paul heads to the door. \nPAUL Who is it? \nMAN'S VOICE (O.S.) State Police.  Is there a Mr. Barnell here? \nPAUL (as he unlocks it) Yes, is there something wrong-- \nAs he opens the door a crack, a gloved hand shoves it open.  The force of the blow sends Paul staggering backward, landing in a heap against the wall where a picture of his family tumbles over and shatters on his head. RAYMOND BARNELL (40s), a bear of man, enters, picks up Paul and throws him through the serving kitchen serving hatch.  Raymond leans through the hole. \nRAYMOND Hello brother. \nHe walks around, takes a copy of \"USA Today\" and throws it at Paul. \nPAUL Raymond?  Is that... \nRAYMOND Page 16, Paul. That's why I love \"USA Today\", news from every fuckin' state.  Don't you want to read it?  I was eaten by wild fuckin' animals.  But ya know, despite that, I'm feeling pretty God-damned chipper. \nPaul beats a hasty retreat, stumbling through the mobile home with Raymond right on his heels. \nPAUL Raymond, let me tell you what happened here.  We all thought you were... \nRAYMOND Dead?  Yeah, I got that impression. \nPAUL But you had dropped off the face of the earth. \nRAYMOND And you just decide to make it permanent? \nPAUL But there were no records of you anywhere.  I checked. \nWith that, Raymond kicks his brother hard in the ribs.  Paul doubles over, gasping for breath. \nRAYMOND In certain lines of quasi-legal employment, using your actual ID can be a hinderance.  But despite the reliance on aliases, it's nice to have your actual birth certificate to fall back on.  Gotta tell ya, Paul, I was pretty pissed. \nRaymond is about to kick him once more, but Paul puts up a hand, begging him to stop.  Raymond, relents, then bends over and helps his brother to a sitting position. \nTED You are a liar and thief. \nPaul stabs his shovel into a snow bank, then walks to Ted. \nPAUL You know Mr. Watters, I've had a pretty rough night, so if you wouldn't mind just leaving. \nPaul tries to guide Ted away, but slips and falls on the snow.  Ted, rolling his eyes, reaches down to help him up. \nTED (noticing the bruises) Hey.  How'd you get all cut up? \nMRS. WHERRY (O.S.) What's say you just move away from him. \nTed, with his hands still on Paul, turns to see -- Mrs. Wherry, from her porch, a compound bow aimed at his forehead. \nMRS. WHERRY (cont'd) You all right there, Paul? \nPAUL I'm fine, Mrs. Wherry.  Just go back inside. \nMRS. WHERRY I can drop him if you want. \nPAUL I'm fine.  Really. (turning to Watters) I think you'd better go. \nTed backs to his car, gets in and drives off.  Paul brushes the snow from his jacket, reaches up, touches his bleeding forehead (the fall having reopened the wound). \nMRS. WHERRY I've got some fishing line if you want me to stitch that. \nPaul waves her off, then stares at the blood on his fingertips.  An idea slowly takes hold. \n95    INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - MOMENTS LATER                                      95 \nRaymond pours whiskey into a 7-11 specialty cup as Paul  pulls off his coat. \nRAYMOND He give you the check? \nPAUL No.  He thinks I...  It'll be fine. \nRAYMOND Maybe I'll pay him a little visit.  See if we can speed up the process. \nPAUL You don't have to... I figured out a way to take care of things. \nRAYMOND Yeah, I was watching from the window. \nPaul, agitated, pulls the blinds shut. \nPAUL You can't do that, Raymond.  If someone sees you... \nRAYMOND Ya know, I been thinking there, Paulie. \nPAUL About what? \nRaymond walks over to Paul.  Paul tenses, expecting to be hit.  Raymond moves right by to refill his drink. \nRAYMOND After we get her back from these guys who grabbed her, you think your wife'll be able to keep her mouth shut? \nPAUL I don't think I... \nRAYMOND Crazy people talk a lot.  And I think if you tell your therapist something, they can use it in court. \nPAUL She's not...  she doesn't have a therapist. \nRAYMOND (taking a slug) Still, might wanna think about it. \nPAUL Think about what? \nRAYMOND You crossed over into the bigs now, Paulie.  Fraud. Consorting with felons.  Got to \"cowboy up.\" \nPAUL Cowboy up? \nRAYMOND Get tough, ya suck-hole.  I'm just saying sometimes a man has to make problematic decisions.  Cull the heard, so to speak. (off his look) Paul, come on, just kiddin' around, here.  Don't be such a fuckin' stick. \nRaymond, an enigma, looks at Paul, then grins -- just kidding.  Paul relaxes. Raymond tenses -- not really.  Paul's not sure how to read his brother as they shoot looks at one another -- sibling rivalry ad absurdum. \n96    EXT. CITY SKYLINE - MORNING                                                   96 \nThe sky moves from dark grey to light grey, then stops.  A thermometer outside on an office tower shows a brisk minus 20.  Workers bundle themselves against the cold, hurry to work past the drifts piled alongside the road. \n97    INT.

Ted moves closer. \nPAUL (MUFFLED) I haven't called the police yet, but I'll tell you it was certainly tempting. \nTed has left the office, SLAMMING the door behind him. \n100   INT. INSURANCE OFFICE STAIRWELL - MOMENTS LATER                              100 \nThe door CLANGS shut behind Paul as he dials his cell phone. \nPAUL Hello... yes, I'm wondering what city department would be in charge of... sure, I can hold. (to himself) Hang on Mag Pie, just hang on. \nPaul puts a hand to his chest.  Suddenly dizzy, he drops to his knees and starts to RETCH.  Tears well up in his eyes.  After a few moments, the storm passes. Still on his knees, the person on the line comes back. \nPAUL (cont'd) Yeah, hi.   I was wondering if you could.... but I was... sure. \nHe sits there, on hold again, waiting... \n101   INT.

Raymond in a ski mask, picks him up, opens the car door and lays Ted's head on the door jamb. \nRAYMOND Listen you little prick, we've had just about enough of this.  You get me? \nRaymond leans onto the door, Ted SCREAMING as his head is squashed in the vice. \nRAYMOND (cont'd) So let's just settle this right now, OK?  We want what's coming to us. \nTed tries to say \"yes.\"  Raymond releases his grip on the door, leans down and grabs Ted's wallet and walks off. \n102   OMITTED                                                                      102 \n103   INT.

Raymond, drunk out of his head, has his arms around two marginal looking HOOKERS. \nPAUL Ray - \nNot wanting to use his brother's real name. \nPAUL (cont'd) Richard!  What in the blazes are you doing? \nRAYMOND Hey Paul.  Took care of our little problem today.  We should see some serious money any time, soon. \nPAUL Could... I have a word with you? \n104   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                              104 \nPaul pulls the sliding door closed behind Raymond. \nPAUL (whisper) Are those...? \nRAYMOND (serious) Prostitutes? (laughing) I sure as hell hope so, cause Jehovah's Witnesses won't lick your lolly no matter how much you pay them. \nPAUL How did you get them here? \nRaymond pulls out the credit card Paul got for him. \nRAYMOND Put it on my plastic.  See, got my name on it and everything.  It's every where I want to be. \nPAUL You can't use that.  You're supposed to be dead! They'll track us down. \nRAYMOND You think they give a shit who pays the bill?  Think for a minute, will ya? \nPaul turns, trying to compose himself, when he notices  a handgun sitting out on the counter. \nPAUL What... Raymond, what is... this? \nPaul pokes at the gun, sending the barrel spinning around to face him. Raymond grabs it and stuffs it into his pants. \nRAYMOND That's \"muh gun,\" Paul. \nPaul's cell phone RINGS. \nRAYMOND (cont'd) Don't be long.  The little spinner's yours. \nPaul picks up the phone as the party revs back up. \nPAUL Yes, hello.  Sorry, what? \n105/106 INTERCUT:  BARNELL HOME / KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS                         105/106 \nJimbo is on the wall mounted phone. \nJIMBO You having a party, Mr. Barnell? (embarrassed for Margaret) That's... that's not right. \nPAUL (picking it up) It was a gift from Raymond.  He bought it for me from Florida.  It's all we have to remember him by. \nPaul puts the shell down on the desk. \nTED That and a million dollars.  Things really worked out for you, didn't they? lots of cash, newly single guy... \nPAUL I'm not single. \nTED ...so you gonna head down to Club Med?  See how much fun a big bank roll can buy? \nPAUL Mr. Watters, I love my wife.  Very much. \nTed can't help but look confused by this simple, yet sincere declaration. \nTED Can we level with each other for a moment? (Paul nods) Did you -- \nBefore he can finish his question, a DELIVERY DRIVER entering the office with a large box. \nPAUL Avis!  Avis? \nThere's no answer.  She's in the back. \nPAUL (cont'd) Will you excuse me? \nPaul gets up to deal with the delivery.  Ted, sullen, picks up the shell and turns it over in his hands.  Avis enter from the back.  She smiles at Ted, then sees the shell. \nAVIS Oh, that's where you went. \nShe takes the shell and reattaches it to the display for Aloha Air.  Ted, confused, walks over as Avis snaps the shell back into place. \nTED That's quite the display. \nAVIS They do some very nice in store promotions. \nPaul walks back, shocked to see the shell now back on the display.  Ted just stares at him. \nAVIS (cont'd) Here it is Mr. Barnell. (to Ted) I thought someone might have walked out with it.  It's not the best neighborhood. \nAvis walks back to her desk.  Ted and Paul hold their look.  Finally, Paul walks back to his desk and the paperwork. \nPAUL So, right here, by the X. \nTed nods.  Paul signs.  Ted takes the envelope with the check, hands it to Paul but doesn't let go.  Paul tries to pull it free.  He looks at Ted who looks right through him.  Just then, the lights go out.  They're all in the dark. \nPAUL (cont'd) We, uh... Avis?  Call Municipal Light and Power and let them know I'll... stop by in a bit. \nPaul looks at Ted, embarrassed.  Ted finally lets go of the check. \nPAUL (cont'd) Thank you. \nTed shakes his head, gets up and walks out. \n109   OMITTED                                                                      109 \nA109  EXT. \"BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL\" - NIGHT                                 A109 \nPaul, seen through the window, sits alone in the dark.

Ted on the sofa, lost in thought and whatever's on the TV. \nTIFFANY There's nothing to be embarrassed about. (a snide glance at Ted) A lot of people find talking to a psychic very therapeutic.  So what's on your mind, Carlos? \n111   INTERCUT WITH: \"BARNELL GREAT ESCAPES TRAVEL\" - CONT.                        111 \nAn overwrought Paul is on the phone with Tiffany, sitting in the dark.  He's got his home phone bill in front of him. \nPAUL I have a situation.  My wife...  do you think it's okay to do something kinda bad to someone if you think they're gonna do something really bad to someone else? \nTIFFANY Sure. \nPAUL What if it's a really bad thing? \nTIFFANY Well, you probably shouldn't break the law if you can help it.  Are you really sure they're going to do this other thing? \nPAUL I'm... I... I don't know.  He said some things.  He said he was joking, but I... I think he might. \nTIFFANY Don't think, know.  How close are you to the other someone else, the one you're trying to protect? \nPAUL (crying) I just, I just...  Have you ever felt like that?  Like your own life didn't even matter, as long as... \nThe lights are back on as Paul, wearing his oversized red parka comes through the front door carrying his sack of cash.  Avis looks up. \nAVIS Mr. Barnell?  I didn't expect you back today.  Nice jacket. \nPAUL Well... I am.  And Avis? \nAVIS Yes? \nPAUL You've been with me for five years?  Paul?  Can we make it Paul? \nPaul enters the back room, closes the door.  Avis walks over. \nAVIS Sure.  I just thought it was more professional when people were around to call you Mr. Barnell. \nPAUL (O.S.) Avis.  There haven't been any people in here for months.  No one comes in here, unless they're looking for pornographic movies or deep fried fish, neither of which we carry.  So you can call me pretty much anything you want and it won't impress the customers at all because we don't have any. \nAVIS Are you OK, Paul? \nPaul opens the door.  Avis is surprised to see billowing clouds of down floating in the air behind him. \nPAUL No Avis, to be frank I'm a little frazzled right now. Now could you get me some tape, my passport out of the safe and two open-ended tickets to Paraguay. \nPaul shuts the door.  Avis gets to work. \n118   INT.

The room is white, very clean and fairly new.  The men wear large orange overalls, their white construction safety helmets sit on the table beside them. \nARNITH Trouble is the city keeps cutting us back and cutting us back. \nRaymond and Paul, wearing his big red parka, enter. \nPAUL Excuse me, are you Arnith? \nARNITH sips his coffee, points to his name patch but doesn't look up. \nPAUL (cont'd) Great.  I was told to give you this. \nPaul hands Arnith a folded form.  Arnith puts his hand out, forcing Paul to move the form to him.  As Arnith looks at it. \nPAUL (cont'd) Disinterment order.  Got it from the coroner's office. My brother didn't want to be buried. \nARNITH How'd you know? \nPAUL Know what? \nARNITH That he didn't want to be buried. \nRAYMOND He left it in a letter. \nARNITH And you just got it now? \nPAUL Ya know, I don't mean to be rude here, but I'm not sure this is any of your business. \nARNITH That's entirely possible. \nBill stifles a LAUGH.  Raymond is about to tear out Arnith's spine.  Paul holds his brother back. \nPAUL I, I don't think this is anything to be flippant about. \nARNITH I appreciate that, Sir.  But I'm on a union specified break right now, which means you are talking to me as a private citizen. Now as a private citizen I can pretty much say whatever I want to. If you talk to me in 15 minutes I can assure you, you will be afforded every courtesy as specified in the workers policy guide and recently ratified in our latest collective agreement dated -- \nPAUL Sorry.  I'm just -- \nARNITH Trying to get your brother out of the ground. We couldn't be more pleased.  You've arranged for transportation of the remains? \nRAYMOND We're gonna take him to go. \nBILL See, now that's a problem.  We can't release the body into your custody unless you are licensed by the state to convey deceased persons. \nARNITH Good point Bill.  Bill knows exhumation policy.  You can look it up but I'm betting he's right.  You come back with a bonded agent and we'll get right on this. \nPaul thinks for a moment, digs into his pocket pulls out five crisp, new hundred dollar bills and SLAMS them on the table. \nPAUL I'll give you five hundred dollars to go get him now. \n119   EXT.

Tiffany watches, not happy. \nTED You're sure this is it? \nTIFFANY She specifically mentioned the cock-sucking turnout up the highway where the snowmobilers hang out. \nTED I'll call later. \nTIFFANY I won't be here. \nTED Excuse me? \nThe phone RINGS.  Tiffany lets it. \nTIFFANY I know relationships aren't all sunshine and roses, but I'm really not having fun anymore, and I don't think you are either. \nTED God, now's so not the time, Tiff. \nTIFFANY Maybe you have to be like this right now, and I'm just not in a good space to deal with it.  But... \nTED But what? \nTIFFANY Maybe we shouldn't be like this together. \nTiffany gives him that look every man who's ever crossed the line for the last time is all too familiar with. \nTed stares.  Words fail him.  Finally, his only recourse is to hurry out the door which shuts with a BANG.  Tiffany lets the phone continue to RING as she stares at the door.  Sadly, she hits the computer key that picks it up. \nTIFFANY (cont'd) Psychic Buddies.  How are you Mr. Bennett?  I think she'd be fine with you remarrying, but hang on, let me concentrate. \nTed opens the door, steps back inside. \nTED OK.  Come on. \nTIFFANY (to Ted) Really? \nTED I've been cutting you out of my life and as a result our normal communication channels have been blocked.  I think you coming with me would... would... \nHe's reaching, but Tiffany looks cautiously hopeful. \nTED (cont'd) ...further the development of our relationship and allow us to both... realize the potential of our... interpersonalism. \nTIFFANY If you're going to be sarcastic. \nTED I'm not being anything.  Swear to God. \nTIFFANY Okay.  Why do you want me to come? \nTED (total sincerity) Cause if you don't, then I'll have to stay, and I'll be mad at you and eventually we'll break up over it, and as bad as my life is right now, that would make it a million times worse. \nTiffany smiles, genuinely touched. \nTIFFANY (into the phone) Mr. Bennett, she's totally cool with it.  but listen, you're gonna have to call back... I gotta go help my boyfriend. \n139   OMITTED                                                                      139 \n140   INT.

You talk, I listen, and I can't interrupt.  Then we switch. \nTED Doesn't sound like much of a game, but...  I can talk about anything? \nTIFFANY Yes. \nTed smiles, and launches in... \n144   INT. JIMBO'S CAR / CITY STREETS - LATER                                      144 \nTed's car pulls up at the far end of the lot, about 200 yards from where Paul, Gary and Jimbo are parked.  Paul's car is in between Ted's car and Jimbo's. \nPaul gets out of his car, as do Jimbo and Gary.  Paul looks for Margaret in the back of Jimbo's car, but she remains lying down on the backseat. \nJIMBO Mr. Barnell.  I'll assume you've got our friend back there? \nPAUL Yes.

He's about to get out when Tiffany stops him. \nTIFFANY (gently) So, do you have a plan here? \nTED I'm gonna go talk to him.  You mind staying here? \nTIFFANY I guess.  So when do we call the cops? \nTED Soon as I... if he actually is doing... something.  I'll wave, alright? \nTiffany gives him a quick kiss. \nTIFFANY That's a very good plan. \nTed's about to jump out of the car, but has to pull back his door as another vehicle slides in beside them, the driver locking his brakes and sliding into the snow embankment. \nTIFFANY (cont'd) Tourists. \nTed, a confused look on his face, looks over as Raymond gets out of his vehicle. \nTIFFANY (cont'd) What? \nTED That was... \nTIFFANY Who? \nTed, too excited, fumbles with his seat belt as he tries to jump out of the car. \n154   CORPSE'S POV: FROM PAUL'S OPEN TRUNK                                         154 \nBlack.

Raymond Barnell? \nRAYMOND I know you? \nTED (confused) You're... You're dead? \nRaymond shoots him a look... Clearly this was taken as a threat.  Ted can't help but step back. \nTED (cont'd) That came out so wrong. \nRaymond sizes up Ted, then looks off to Paul's car. \nRAYMOND Go away, now. \nRaymond walks on.  Ted, realizing he has no choice, runs and jumps in front of Raymond, blocking his way. \nTED Okay, I don't know exactly what's going on here, but if you would come with me to my office, just for a few minutes, it would really help me out with my boss. \nRaymond steps around Ted.  Ted stays with him. \nTED (cont'd) Look, I'm not trying to screw with your life at all, but you can't just walk off with a million dollars and expect people to-- \nRAYMOND (stops cold) How much? \nTED See, your brother has, and I use this term carefully, stolen a million dollars from my insurance company. Now if we-- \nBefore he can finish, Raymond hits him with an elbow to the temple.  Ted drops to his knees, but even as Raymond tries to walk off, Ted manages to grab his ankle. \nRAYMOND (cont'd) Oh put it down, Nancy. \nGARY You first. \nJIMBO Gary!  Just -- \nRaymond drops his gun to his side.  Gary smiles, too happy he won the face off. \nRAYMOND You win, tough guy. \nGary, trying to be cool, flips the gun to his other hand.  As he does-- BANG!  The bullet rips into the snow about six feet from Raymond's feet. \nRaymond glares at Gary.  So does Jimbo. \nGARY (meek, apologetic) Sorry. \nJimbo lunges for cover as Raymond FIRES back.  Gary, truly terrified, closes his eyes as he squeezes off shots on the run -- BANGBANGBANGBANG. \nOne bullet bounces off Paul's car.  One hits Raymond.  With a quizzical look on his face, he drops to his knees.  A large crimson stain forms on his jacket. Everything goes quiet, except for the sounds coming from... \nPaul, almost crazed with grief, cradles his wife's body. \nPAUL Oh God... Oh Jesus... \nMARGARET (muffled) Oh fucking hell... I can't... breath. \nPaul gently turns her over.  Margaret, alive, unharmed but winded, tries to catch her breath. \nMARGARET (cont'd) Paul...  Someone kicked me. \nPaul feels around the bullet hole and pulls out a stack of money, now embedded with the slug from the Raymond's gun.  He starts to weep tears of relief. \nPAUL Can you stand. \nMARGARET Is... The Pope... a... \nPAUL Okay, easy... \nGary is behind the other car with Jimbo. \nGARY (starting to lose it) He just, fell... Oh Jesus, oh God. \nJimbo gently takes Gary's gun. \nJIMBO I know. \nAs Jimbo puts an arm around Gary and helps him to the car, he sees Paul, arm around Margaret, coming their way.  Everyone stops.  A look passes, then both couples move off. \n161   EXT.

Spotting Raymond, he walks over, kicks the gun away, then leans down.  Raymond's not dead, but he's close. \nPaul has to turn away. \nRAYMOND (laboured) Look at me, you little... \nPaul turns back, not angry, not frightened, just a little sad.  Raymond, taken aback for a moment, tries for one last verbal shot, but all he can manage is... \nRAYMOND (cont'd) Puddles. \nAnd Raymond dies. \n162   EXT.

I have been beaten, humiliated, had my head squeezed by a guy... and I am getting some answers, right now. \nTed, barely able to stay on his feet (concussion) gets in front of Paul, and just stands there and waits.  Paul can't help but feel bad for the guy. \nPAUL Okay. \nTED Well go ahead. (re: his left ear) I can still kind of hear out of this one. \nPAUL (a long pause) I love my wife, Mr. Watters.  And when you love someone, I mean, really love someone... \nThe punch hits Paul on the top of his head.  He stumbles back, but Ted is on him before he can move out of range.

I'll be sure to pass that along. \nThe delivery guy leaves. \nTed walks back into the living room.  Tiffany comes over, grabs a slice. \nTIFFANY Why you gotta argue with the service industry? \nTED The problem with people today is they don't expect anyone to tell the truth. We've just come to accept lying as acceptable. \nTIFFANY If this is another passive/aggressive shot at Psychic Buddies, all our ads state \"for amusement purposes only.\" \nTED Tiff, it has nothing to do with... look, just forget it. \nTIFFANY You remember being amused, don't ya, honey? What is with you anyway? \nTED Want to know what's \"with\" me?  I'm on the verge of cracking the biggest case of my career, one that corporate has to notice, and nobody gives a crap. Not my boss, and not even my girlfriend. \nTIFFANY So this is my fault? \nTED No, it's not your fault. I just want to live somewhere where road hazards don't have antlers and the pizza doesn't have to be delivered by dogsled. \nTiffany storms off as Ted flops onto the couch, swipes the snow from the top of the pizza box and hits play on the DVD. \nEDWARD G. ROBINSON \"What kind of outfit is this, anyway?  Are we an insurance company or a bunch of dim-witted amateurs to write a policy on a mug like that?\" \nTiffany turns from the bedroom door, almost in tears. \nTIFFANY You know, even though Edward G.

Was he getting along with his brother? \nMRS. WHERRY No.  Only saw him the once.  Never spoke.  Waved to him. \nTED Waved? \nMRS. WHERRY He was clearing my driveway.  Raymond was a real hellcat when he was younger.  But like they say, time mellows even the hardest soul. \nTED Was he much of an outdoorsman? \nMRS. WHERRY I thought it was Paul at first.

People around here have been known to swap a snow mobile for 500 pounds of venison. Doesn't exactly leave a paper trail. \nTED Yes, but he was in Florida, someplace.

They asked me to bring some photos of Raymond.  Guess it's gonna be a pretty big story. \nHe pulls out some shots of his brother.

Through that... big hole in the roof.  I got a list of all the things that are missing. \nTed stares up at the sky through the ceiling. \nTED How much? \nSPELLMAN Uh, we figure about 200,000, plus fixing the roof. Now I know you guys are gonna bust my -- \nTED Fax over your estimate.  We'll have you a check by Friday. \nCAM (taking Ted aside) Ted.  Maybe we should take a look at their inventory list first? \nTED This is a simple case, Cam.  Bad guys, through roof, stole stuff.  Let's clear it and get going. \nSPELLMAN I should tell you... we also had some VCRs we were holding for another company.  That could run another couple of... \nTED Cam?  You wanna wrap this up? (off his look) Gotta go primary some time. \nCam shrugs-- \"sure.\"  Ted hands him his clipboard and walks out, the door closes behind him with a loud BANG. \nCAM Mr. Spellman?  Now I noticed a nice looking computer in your office.  Why do you think they left that? \n81    INT. BARNELL HOME / LIVING ROOM - LATER                                       81 \nMargaret sits taped to a Lazy-Boy recliner.  Gary, who's still bleeding from the nose, sits across from her. \nMARGARET You try and rape me, I swear to Christ I'll bite it off. \nGary looks confused.  The doorbell CHIMES, playing \"Tiny Bubbles.\"  (We stay in the living room as Gary answers it.) \nJIMBO (O.S.) What's going on? \nGARY (O.S.) Okay, now here's the thing, just keep an open mind. \nThey both enter the room.  Jimbo looks at Gary, is about to smack him when... \nMARGARET So what now, you gonna get me smokin' from both ends? \nGary and Jimbo have no idea how to react.  Margaret senses their discomfort, starts to relax. \nGARY I just came to look around, but she started yelling and hitting me... \nMARGARET Oh please. \nJIMBO How the hell is this solving our problem?  How is this stepping up? \nGARY Just listen, okay. \nMARGARET Yeah, listen, if the fat from your neck hasn't stopped up your ears. \nJimbo looks confused.  Gary ushers him into the other room. \n82    INT. BARNELL HOME / KITCHEN - LATER                                           82 \nGary and Jimbo sit at the table, talking.  Jimbo's not happy. \nJIMBO This is not what we do. \nGARY It is now. \nJIMBO Where would we stash her?  Your place? \nGARY Too small, plus we'd have to get her in and out without anyone seeing.  And I've seen that sty you call an apartment. \nJIMBO See, it's just a bad idea. \n", "test3_input": "PAUL They said it'd be in tomorrow by -- \nRAYMOND Right, right, you told me.  Then all we have to do is get her and the thing... Hey, remember that time in school, when I jumped out and scared you, and you fucking pee'd all over yourself? \nPAUL Was pretty funny. (raises his mug) Bottoms up. \nRAYMOND Okay, \"Puddles.\"  Remember how they called you that?  Huh, \"Puddles?\" (about to drink - then) Christ, what time is it? \nPAUL It's early.  Come on... ya... (uncomfortably) ...pussy. \nRaymond LAUGHS, takes the drink. \n127   EXT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME - CONTINUOUS                                        127 \nA beautiful winter's night, the soft snowy silence broken only by Raymond's drunken shot of... \nRAYMOND (O.S.) Pussy!!! \nA startled rabbit scurries across the snow. \n128   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / VARIOUS - LATER                                   128 \nRaymond is passed out on the sofa.  Paul sits, gun in hand, the barrel pointed at Raymond's forehead.  His finger grazes the trigger...  but it's suddenly all too real.  Paul lowers the gun, takes a deep breath and tries again.  Not wanting to be sprayed by Raymond's gray matter, he half turns his head...  Another idea comes to him.  Paul picks up a plastic picnic plate to use as a shield from the blow back. \nHe gets ready to fire again, then makes the mistake of looking at Raymond. Maybe it's the light... maybe it's the small puddle of drool on the cushion, but he looks almost angelic.  Paul stares at his brother. \nIn the kitchen, Paul fills a glass with water, empties the pistol's bullets into The cup and hides it on the top shelf. \nPaul puts the gun back.  Not sure of his next move, he spots the beat up clock radio lying next to his brother. \nA128  EXT.

As he starts singing, Margaret sits up and scooches over to the phone on the end table.  Her hands tied loosely to her chest, she manages to dial by placing the phone receiver flat on the bed. \nJIMBO (O.S.) Gary!  You seen my shirt? \nMargaret looks over to see Jimbo, wearing Paul's pajamas, walking past while shaving with a portable razor.  As the line rings. \nJIMBO (O.S.) (cont'd) Aw jeez, again? \nGARY (O.S.) It relaxes me.  You know it has twelve different settings? \nJIMBO (O.S.) No Gary, I don't know that because every time I thought about using it someone was in it. \nGARY (O.S.) Hey, I do a lot around here. \nAs they continue to squabble, the phone line connects. \n911 RECORDING You have reached 9-11.  All our operators are busy, but your call will be handled in the order in which it was received.  If this is a -- \nMargaret, using her nose, hangs up. \n132   INT. BARNELL MOBILE HOME / LIVING ROOM                                       132 \nPaul, quiet as a mouse and dressed in his money-lined parka, picks up his cell and his car keys, drops them quietly into his pocket.  Just as he finishes... \nRAYMOND (half asleep) What's going on. \nPAUL We're out of coffee.  But I'll be right back.  Still early. \nNot to worry.  Raymond has already rolled over. \n133   INT.

And connects. \nMARGARET Paul? \nAUTOMATED VOICE (O.S.) The number you have dialed is no longer in service. If you think you have -- \nMargaret disconnects the call, then dials again. \n134   INT.

(coughs)  Hello? \nHe hits a few keys on the computer keyboard.  The screen pops to life.  The line connects. \nMARGARET Oh thank fucking Christ.  Is Tiffany there? \nTED No, she's... \nHe pulls off a yellow Post It note stuck to the computer.  It reads:  \"Coffee made. Don't touch my computer.  Back in 10.\" \nUnseen on the computer screen beside him, the name \"Margaret Barnell\" pops up, along with all her pertinent information like pet's name, husband, delusions... \nTED (cont'd) She'll be back in a few minutes.  You want to try later? \nMARGARET Well you should know, fuck-wit.  You know there's a man with a gun in my shower, right now? \nTed, distracted, turns as he hears the doorknob turning. \nTED Hang on, she's on her way -- \nFinally he notices the computer screen.  Holy shit. \nTED (cont'd) (tentatively) Mrs. Barnell? \nBut before she can answer, Tiffany walks in carrying a laundry basket, pulls the headset off Ted's head and holds it up to her ear. \nTIFFANY I'm here, Margaret.  How you feeling today? \nTED Give me the headset. \nTed grabs for the headset, Tiffany resists. \nTIFFANY (to Ted) What is wrong with you? \n135   INT.

Mrs. Barnell?  Could you speak up a bit? \nTed is at her side, trying to listen in by pressing his ear to the outside of the headset. \nTED What's she saying? \nTIFFANY Something about the gay mafia taking her to a park to kill her.  Can you hand me my Help Line list? \nTED What... Wha... \nTed's throat seizes up again.  He stumbles to the kitchen, gulping water from the faucet. Tiffany watches with some amusement. \nTIFFANY Margaret, are you sure these are real people in your house? \nTED Find out where she... \nHis voice locks up again.  More water. \nTIFFANY (listening to a profane ramble) Well then it's a good thing you called.  Nope, not seeing any problems, but hang on, let me really concentrate. \nTED Ask her... \nTed's not doing much better. \n137   INT.

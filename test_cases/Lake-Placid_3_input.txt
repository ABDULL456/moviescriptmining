Sure enough... that giant snout breaks the surface.  Ever so calmly... it moves toward the cow. 
EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
KELLY (into walkie-talkie) If he gets close, you go up, Hector, don't you endanger that cow. 
KEOUGH She's worried about the cow now. 
HECTOR (O.S.) (through walkie-talkie) He's following.  Here we come. 
ANGLE THE RADAR SCREEN 
Depicting the same. 
EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
JACK (to Hector) Nice and slow. (to the others) Let's get ready. 
Hector's chopper, cow dangling, is slowly approaching the shore. Behind it... the snout and eyes of a giant croc.  Back on the shore, Keough's men ready themselves for action.  Tranq guns. rifles... the team is mobilized.  We HEAR a DISTRESSED CRY from the COW. 
KELLY He's mooing. 
JACK You wouldn't? 
KEOUGH They're coming right in. 
KELLY Such a simple idea and it's working.  What does that tell you? 
KEOUGH That it's about to go wrong. 
JACK (into walkie talkie) Almost here, Hector.  Don't forget to lift up the cow. 
HECTOR (O.S.) (sarcastic, through walkie talkie) Thank you, Jack. 
JACK (to the team) You shoot on my order.  If he charges, I'll be yelling "go" which means drivers take off.  And drive fast, they can move on land. (to Keough) You set? 
KEOUGH Don't worry about me. 
Incredibly... the plan is working.  A giant dragon is following a dangled suspended cow to the shoreline. 
Hector dangles the cow closer, they're now nearing shore.  The big crocodile, eyes on the prize, is moving in for the flank steak.  The time is now. 
INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS 
HECTOR We're in about four feet of water now. 
EXT. BEACH - CONTINUOUS 
JACK Little closer.  Three, two, one... 
The crocodile then suddenly thrusts up after the cow, snapping at air.  Hector pulls up with the chopper. 
JACK (CONT'D) Fire!! 
Jack, Gare, and other officers pump the beast with tranq darts. But Hector has taken his chopper up too fast, causing the cow to swing like a pendulum.  It rocks the chopper. 
INT. CHOPPER - CONTINUOUS 
HECTOR Oh, shit. 
The chopper is in trouble.  The cow sways, the helicopter struggles to stay airborne. 
EXT. BEACH - ANGLE KELLY - CONTINUOUS 
KELLY (screaming) Watch out!! 
JACK Keep firing!

BUNDINI (CONT'D) This is it. 
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA Two minutes! 
BUNDINI The prophet's come back to claim his own! Get the pretender off that throne! 
BUNDINI/ALI Rumble, young man, rumble! It's the "Rumble in the Jungle"! 
WIDE FROM ABOVE:   ALI'S CAMP 
starts moving towards the door. They open the door. It is guarded by a handpicked squad of paratroopers and Lieutenant Nsakala. 
LIEUTENANT NSAKALA (shouts) One minute! 
INT. CORRIDOR 
Paratroopers on either side like a wedge, guarding Ali with Angelo, Bundini, Rudy and Herbert, as they push through the door, out into the hall. 
TRAVEL WITH THEM AS 
people in the corridor at the end see Ali.       The chant begins... 
THE PEOPLE Ali! Ali! Boma ye, Ali!       Ali! Boma ye! 
The sound from the corridor picks up a second reverberation that booms from a distant vast space. As we move towards it, to encounter it. And suddenly we... 
BURST OUT INTO THE STADIUM... 
EXT. KINSHASA ARENA - WIDE:     EVERYTHING - NIGHT 
Lights flood it.   They pour down artificial sunshine. 
THE PEOPLE Ali, boma ye! Ali, boma ye!      Ali, boma ye! 
ROARS from 65,000 voices at a quarter to four in the morning. The moon is out, revealing storm clouds. 
HIGH + WIDE SHOTS:        ALI 
and entourage.      The crowd goes nuts. 
TRAVELING WITH ALI THROUGH THE MASS 
The crowd roars; Angelo behind, Bundini on one side, Pacheco and Sarria. 
EXT. RING - WE ENTER 
They cheer. Ali raises his hand and salutes them. Ali dances from one end of the ring to the other...dances into George's corner... The crowd roars. 
ANOTHER ANGLE:      ALI dances back to his corner... 
ANGELO DUNDEE George is playing prima donna.   He wants to make you wait. 
Ali laughs. You won't psyche out Muhammad Ali with that stuff. Instead, Ali uses the time. He tests the ropes. He gets the feel of the distance between the center and the corner. 
CLOSER:   ALI 
circles the ring. He looks at the crowd from different angles, from the corner, the center... He looks up at the lights and gets used to the heat from them. 
ALI'S FEET 
do a shuffle. He feels the canvas. He feels the soft spots. The firm spots. He feels how much slide there is because of the resin on the canvas, how much spring there is in the boards... 
ALI 
sheds his robe, now, and throws a blistering array of jabs and hooks. The crowd goes nuts. Ali looks ringside and sees... 
ALI'S POV:      JIM BROWN 
Lloyd Price...further along...Robert Lipsyte. 
EXT. ARENA - AISLE - SUDDENLY 
out comes Foreman in his red robe, Archie Moore following in his blue pea-cap, and Dick Sadler -- never a fashion plate -- in the world's least-attractive T-shirt, followed 
by former featherweight champ Sandy Saddler. 
CROWD Foreman!   Foreman!   Foreman!   Foreman! 
THE RING - ALI 
is shadowboxing as Foreman climbs in the ring and crosses past him, near to him. The look on Ali's face is indifferent. Foreman goes immediately to his stool. He doesn't move around the ring. He doesn't touch the ropes. 
DISSOLVE TO: 
DON KING 
as tall as only three other men: Foreman, Ali and Bundini, walks into the ring wearing black... 
ZACK CLAYTON, 
the referee, moves to the center of the ring.      A great roar fills the air: "ALI, BOMA YE! ALI, BOMA YE!        ALI, BOMA YE!"...another one. "FOREMAN! FOREMAN!"

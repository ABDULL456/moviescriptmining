DORR And what, to flog a horse that if not at this point dead is in mortal danger of expirin', does the dotted square represent? 
Gawain hesitates, the question's obviousness suggesting to him some trick. 
GAWAIN ...Offices. Underground. 
Dorr's eyes close. A smile of feline contentment curls his lips. He murmurs: 
DORR Underground... Mmm... During the casino's hours of operation the door to the counting room is fiercely guarded, and the door itself is of redoubtable Pittsburgh steel; when the casino is closed the entire underground complex is locked up and the armed guard retreats to the casino's main entrance. There, then, far from the guard, reposes the money, cosseted behind a five-inch-thick steel portal, yes, but the walls, gentlemen, the walls of that room, are but humble masonry, behind which is only the soft loamy soil deposited over the centuries by Ol' Man, the meanderin' Mississip', as it fanned its way back and forth across this great alluvial plain... 
He has pried a fistfull of dirt from the cellar wall. 
DORR ...This earth. 
He crumbles it, letting it sift to the floor, and then, pleased with himself, he smiles. 
DORR ...Any questions? 
Lump looks around, then hesitantly raises his hand. 
DORR ...Yes, Lump? 
LUMP What, uh... what does "cosseted" mean? 
Once again Dorr's smile fades. He does not dignify the question with answer. 
DORR The General here, whose curriculum vitae compahends massive tunneling experience thoo the soil of his native French-Indochina, will direct our little ol' tunnelin' operation. 
The General acknowledges with a curt nod. 
DORR ...Clark Pancake, while a master of none, is a jack of all those trades corollary to our aim. He will be doin' such fabricatin' and demolition work as our little caper shall require. 
Clark acknowledges verbally: 
PANCAKE Happy to be on board. 
DORR Gawain is the proverbial "inside man". He has managed to secure a berth on the custodial staff of the Lady Luck, thereby placin' himself in a position to perform certain chores whose precise nature needn't detain us here, but whose performance shall guide this expedition to its happy conclusion. 
GAWAIN Ya damn skippy. 
DORR And this brings us to Lump. To look at Lump you might wonder, what function could he possibly fill, what specialized expertise could he possibly offer, to our merry little ol' band a miscreants. Well gentlemen, in a project of such magnitude and such risks, it is traditional -- nay, it is imperative -- to enlist the services of a hooligan, a goon, an ape, a physical brute, who will be our security, our fist, our batterin' ram. Lump is our blunt instrument, and on all our behalfs I wish him a warm Mississippi welcome. 
LUMP Thanks, Professor. 
DORR Well gentlemen, here you are, men of different backgrounds and differing talents, men with, in fact only two things in common: one, you all saw fit to answer my little advertisement in the Memphis Scimitar, and, two, you are all going to be, in consequence, very very incredibly rich. Let us revel in our adventure, gentlemen. Let us make beautiful music together. And above all, gentlemen, let us keep it to ourselves. What we say in this root cellar, let it stay in this root cellar. 
LUMP There's no "I" in "team". 
All stare at him. 
DORR ...Lump has a very excellent point. 
The music swells, supported now by a male chorus that has the spirited manliness of the Red Army choir. We 
DISSOLVE TO: 
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - BASEMENT - NIGHT 
The men at work, tunneling. 
The cat sits on the cellar floor, head cocked, gazing at the hole now opened in the wall. 
Lump, in a sleeveless undershirt, glistening with sweat, wields a pickaxe at the forward point. 
At the mouth of the hole Clark Pancake shovels dirt into a heavy plastic refuse bag held open by Gawain. 
G.H. Dorr sits on a camp chair, one hand idly waving time to the music, reading an old and yellowed tome with half-glasses perched midway down his nose. 
The General hops nimbly out of the tunnel and unzips and steps out of his all-in-one to reveal, underneath, his neatly pressed leisure suit and ascot. 
INT. MUNSON HOUSE - LIVING ROOM - NIGHT 
Later, Dorr stands at the head of the cellar stairs, looking around the empty parlor. He gives a nod down the stairs and the men troop up past him, carrying sacks of earth. 
Over the mantelpiece, the eternal flame of the devotional candle almost animating his features, Othar seems to watch the men as they cross to the front door. 
EXT. MUNSON HOUSE - NIGHT 
The men load the earth into the hearse. 
EXT. MISSISSIPPI RIVER - NIGHT 
We are at the Mississippi bridge that we saw in the prologue to the movie, but now, in dead of night, deserted. 
The hearse is pulling up at the middle of the bridge and dimming its lights. The men emerge; when they open the back of the hearse to pull out the sacks, the cat bounds out to watch from a distance. 
We watch the men from HIGH, ANGLED DOWN along the masonry of a tower that stands in the middle of the suspension bridge. An ornamental gargoyle leers in the foreground. 
The garbage scow is approaching. We hear the low toot of its horn as it nears the bridge. 
Lump is poised with the first sack hugged to his chest, leaning over the railing.

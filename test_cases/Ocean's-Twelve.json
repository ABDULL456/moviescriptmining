You guys have a minute? \nDANNY Sure, Linus. \nRUSTY What's on your mind? \nLINUS Well, I know this may not be the exact right time to bring this up, but I've been thinking about...well, about where I want to be in five years, career-wise, and I've decided I really want to be more than just a role-player.

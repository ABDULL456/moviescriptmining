Whatever it is, it is clearly getting to him. He shakes his head; it's not right. It's just not good enough. Rusty glances at the digital thermometer attached to the cask of molten metal. It reads: 736.18 degrees. \nRUSTY You are kidding me. \n17   INT.

He's keeping an eye on a white Cadillac that seem to be following him. \nRUSTY 736.18 degrees Fahrenheit, Felix. I watched it. \nFELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.) Rusty. What do you want from me? \nRusty turns a corner, then glances in his rearview again. \nRUSTY I want what I paid for. \nFELIX And that's what I sent. \nRUSTY No, Felix, no. I paid for pure. And if my workshop were on top of Mount Everest it would be pure. But I'm at sea level, Felix, and at sea level it should liquefy at 736.95. If it's pure, that is. Which this isn't. \nRusty makes another turn. A few seconds later, the Cadillac turns behind him. \nFELIX (TELEPHONE V.O.) Well, I didn't know you were going to liquefy it. \nRusty pulls to a stop light. The Cadillac pulls up three cars behind him. \nRUSTY Let me ask you something: When Christo calls his cotton supplier and asks for 100% cotton cloth, do you think his supplier sends him 98% cotton and 2% polyester and when that doesn't work, says to Christo, \"Well, you should have told me you were going to wrap the coast of Australia\"? \n(CONTINUED) \n17   CONTINUED:                                                 17 \nFELIX Who's Christo? \nRusty looks to the heavens. \nRUSTY Felix, you're in a shame spiral. Have your assistant lose my number. \nRusty snaps his phone shut. \nRUSTY (cont'd) My god. \nRusty looks into the rear view mirror and then slows the car to a stop. He gets out of his car and slams the door shut. He walks back to the Cadillac and knocks on the window. It rolls down electronically to reveal Benedict. \nRUSTY (contd) How long you gonna give us? \n18   INT.

Did you hear what I said? \nReuben, Yen, the Malloys, Frank, Livingston, Saul, Basher, and Linus are all talking at once -- right at us. Right at Danny. And they are not happy. \nThe group is in an abandoned WAREHOUSE somewhere near NYC. \nDanny is overwhelmed, like a deer caught in the headlights. He throws a desperate glance at Rusty, who's looking out the window serenely, letting Danny flounder. \n31   MOMENTS LATER                                                31 \nTotal silence.

Noticing this, Danny and Rusty move into a nearby dilapidated office doorway. \nThe guys go back to talking, mostly about what they were doing when they were found. This rises steadily in volume until the din is obliterated by a LOUD VOICE: \nDANNY (cont'd) I'M TELLING YOU THIS IS A DEATH SENTENCE! \nRUSTY FINE, THEN STAY HERE! \nThe guys exchange glances. Danny walks over to them and sighs. \nCUT TO: \n32   INT.

What I'm trying to tell you is the reservations agent made a mistake when she issued the ticket, because on the rare occasions that I fly commercially, I always book a first- class ticket with no restrictions-- \nThe desk agent looks back at him skeptically. \nKLM AGENT She may have, air, but this is the only ticket available to you on this flight. I need you to step aside so I can take care of the next customer. \nDANNY You called her mother a whore. \nRUSTY A really cheap one. \nLINUS Guys, I'm not falling for this.

It's extremely well-protected. \nA photo of a four-story canal house is displayed on a flat screen connected to Livingston's computer. \nSAUL What are we after? \nDANNY A document. A very old, very valuable document. \nA photo labeled \"The Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift\" is displayed on screen. \nVIRGIL What is it? \nRUSTY A stock certificate. \nDANNY The first one ever issued, from the first corporation on the planet. The Dutch East India Trading Company. It's the only one of it's kind and it's worth a boat-load. \nTURK What's our cut? \nRUSTY 2.7 million after expenses. \nA beat.

(points to a diagram) But the alarm is really controlled by the keypad in Mr. Vanderspeigle's second floor office. Now, here's good news: we already know the system's master code. Evelyn gave it to us. \nFRANK That's not good news, that's really good news. \nVIRGIL We just wait until he leaves. \nDANNY Yeah, well...that's the bad news. \nRUSTY He doesn't. \nFrank flinches. Doesn't like what he's hearing. \nDANNY He's agoraphobic. \n47   AMSTERDAM PLANNING MONTAGE                                 47 \nShots of their mark, Vanderspeigle, being an agoraphobic weirdo. \nLIVINGSTON So he's never been out of his house?

Doesn't this guy believe in fresh air? \nRUSTY (V.O.) Cracks his windows at night...that's about it. \nWhen Vanderspeigle cracks his window we see that locking pins fall into place to prevent the window from opening more than a few inches. \nLIVINGSTON (V.O.) Can we tap into the system from the outside through the phone lines? \nRUSTY (V.O.) Negative. It's a closed-loop system with two redundant servers locked into titanium cases in the guy's bedroom. \n47A   We SEE the servers in Vanderspeigle's bedroom.             47A \nBASHER (V.O.)

He can't get a clear shot of the target. In fact, he can't see it. He turns to Saul. \nBASHER Let me see the specs. \nSaul pulls a well-worn copy of the alarm system blueprint. Basher goes to the height of the alarm keypad in the bedroom. It's 4' 10\". \nBASHER How tall is the surface of this roof? \nSAUL About 87 feet. \nBASHER How tall exactly? \n53   INT.

Some places we're only three or four inches off...but...there's no straight shot. Even with Basher. It's literally impossible. \nLinus enters, out of breath. Seeing everyone, he goes to Danny and Rusty. \nLINUS Can I talk to you guys for a second? \nThey nod and allow Linus to pull them into the corner. Linus looks over at the group and then turns to 'them. \nLINUS Listen, I've done a little research on the Schuman Special, and uh...we don't have line of sight for the shot. \nDANNY What? \nRUSTY Jesus. This'll kill us. \nDANNY (to Linus) Listen: Don't say anything. If you're ever going to run your own crew, you've got to remember to never show weakness. \nRUSTY It's like blood in the water for these guys. \n(CONTINUED) \n53   CONTINUED: (2)                                           53 \nDANNY If they think you're slipping, you won't even see it coming. \nLinus swallows. \nRUSTY But hey--thanks. \nLinus nods and goes back to the group. \nRUSTY (to Danny) I need some air. \n54   EXT.

They are covered in muck and grime \nRUSTY The good news is, after the first twelve hours, I stopped being able to smell anything. \nDANNY Took a few more for me. \nRUSTY This water was stagnant six hundred years ago. \nFIND the Malloys, thirty feet away, using a fancy underwater saw to cut a space in another pylon. Because the cutting is taking place underwater it is extremely quiet. \nVIRGIL There's no reason for him not to. He would go to the cops. \nTURK Okay, so he goes to the cops. \nVIRGIL Then they arrest Dominique. \nTURK. Right. \nVIRGIL Then we have no story. \nTURK Right. \nLINUS She steals the money from Mr. Mulroney. \nThey turn to look at Linus, sawing nearby. \nTURK What? \nVIRGIL Why would she? \n(CONTINUED) \n58   CONTINUED: (2)                                               58 \nLINUS To pay Franklin to keep quiet. \nTurk and Virgil think about that.

Then each of them reach into their jackets and produce $20 bills. They exchange and examine the bills closely by eye.

Do you want some orange juice? I got the good kind. \nJust then they are interrupted by Danny's voice on a walkie- talkie. \nDANNY (V.O.) Augie One, this is Condor. \n61   UNDER VANDERSPEIGLE'S HOUSE                                 61 \nRusty turns to Danny. \nLIVINGSTON (V.O.) This is Augie One; Go Condor. \n62   INT.

She's really just answering the detective's questions out of courtesy. \n(CONTINUED) \n69   CONTINUED: (2)                                                69 \nISABEL Uh...well, they probably set up in a house across the canal and watched him type the code in through a pair of binoculars. \nWe GO WITH HIM as he walks back into the office. He stands at the alarm panel and pretends to type in the code. He twists around and looks out the window behind him. \nPAUL (calling to Isabel in the bedroom) Actually, I don't know about that. \nIsabel re-enters the office. \nPAUL (cont'd) Unless he had a habit of typing in the code like this-- \nHe stands to the side of the panel and reaches over to type in the numbers. It's an obviously unnatural position. Then he moves in front of the panel and types in the code as one normally would. \nPAUL (cont'd) --then his body would block the view from across the canal. \nISABEL That's why they probably set up over there-- \nShe points out an adjacent window on another wall. \nISABEL (cont'd) --And used the mirror. \nShe points at a small mirror on the opposite wall. The detective bends down so his eye is at the level of the keypad, then he looks in the mirror. He can see directly across the canal into another house. \nISABEL (cont'd) I'm guessing they'd need a fifteen hundred millimeter lens to get a clear shot but-- \nBut Isabel's already moved on. Something has caught her attention just above the alarm panel: a patch of paint that is shinier than the paint that surrounds it. \n(CONTINUED) \n69   CONTINUED: (3)                                              69 \nIsabel puts her finger to her tongue to wet it, then touches the shiny area. When she pulls her finger away there is paint on it. \nIsabel cocks her head. \n70   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                    70 \nA black-clad thief (LINUS) uses a paint brush to touch up the wall above the alarm keypad. \n71   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                           71 \nThe lead detective watches Isabel intently. \nPAUL What is it? \nIsabel uses the blunt end of a letter opener from Vanderspeigle's desk to gently dig at the wall under the paint. The plaster there is soft and wet. In fact it isn't plaster at all. It's spackle. \nPAUL (cont'd) What is that? \nIsabel cooks her head again. \n72   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                    72 \nTHUNK!   A crossbow bolt hits the wall above the alarm panel. \n73   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                           73 \nISABEL It's where the crossbow bolt hit. \nPAUL A crossbow bolt? \nISABEL Ever heard of Franz Schuman? \nPAUL No. \n(CONTINUED) \n73   CONTINUED:                                                    73 \nIsabel is at the window. The one that Vanderspeigle leaves cracked open every night. Isabel looks across the canal at the apartment where Basher and Saul were playing cards. \nISABEL They would have fired from that roof. Through this open window. \nIsabel kneels down, checks the line-of-sight to make sure she's correct. \nPAUL From that roof, through this window? Nobody could make a shot like that. \nISABEL Not a cop, anyway. \nPAUL What's that supposed to mean? \nISABEL Sorry. Your friend downstairs put me in a bad mood. \nPAUL He's an idiot. You shouldn't let him bother you. \nISABEL Yes. You're right. \nIsabel pulls out a notepad and writes the name: \"Eugene `Basher' Tarr.\" There are two names above Basher's in her little book: \"Robert Ryan\" and \"Danny Ocean.\" \nISABEL (cont'd) But these man are exceptionally good. Even when they make mistakes. \n74   MIND'S EYE (ISABEL) -- THE NIGHT BEFORE                      74 \nA bolt flies through Vanderspeigle's open window and hits the wall above the alarm pad. Two thin wires are attached to a tiny wheel, which is attached to the back of the bolt. The wires run back to the window of the apartment across the canal. \n(CONTINUED) \n79   CONTINUED: (2)                                              79 \nDINNER JACKET There's really no need for that. \nDanny wants to raise his voice, but he can't.   Vanderspeigle is snoring twenty feet away. \nDANNY Listen, we have to come to some arrangement. \nLINUS We've incurred some very serious costs here. \nDanny and Rusty look at him. \nLINUS Well, we have. \nThe Malloys arrive. \nDINNER JACKET Every second I am becoming more outnumbered. \nVIRGIL (whispering, re: Dinner Jacket) Who's this? \nFRANK He said he got here first. \nVIRGIL That's bullshit. \nRUSTY Hey. Mouth. \nVIRGIL This is our goddamned job! \nHe sounds as angry as a guy who's whispering can sound. \nLIVINGSTON If the situation were reversed-- \nDINNER JACKET But the situation is not reversed. The situation is that I am here first, without any help from you. \n(CONTINUED) \n79   CONTINUED: (3)                                                 79 \nLivingston arrives, soaking wet like everyone else. \nDINNER JACKET So as much as I would-- \nBasher and Saul arrive. \nDINNER JACKET Jesus, how many of you are there? \nDANNY Just give us the stock certificate. Whatever else you took out of that safe...it's yours. \nDinner Jacket stops.   Thinks for a moment.   Then: \nDINNER JACKET No. But: I leave you with something. \nHe hands Danny a business card. \nDINNER JACKET My attorney. In case Evelyn's employer tries anything...well, anything. \nDinner Jacket smiles, then pulls a tiny electronic device out of his shirt pocket. He presses a button. \nAnd the alarm blares to life. \n80   BACK TO SCENE -- THE CRIME SCENE                              80 \nPaul stares at Isabel. \nPAUL Are you sure? \nISABEL I'm sure there's another scenario that would fit these physical details, but I don't know what it is. \nPAUL Where should we start? \nIsabel takes out her PDA, writes something on her keypad, and hits a few buttons. A second later, Paul's BEEPER goes off. \n(CONTINUED) \n80   CONTINUED:                                               80 \nISABEL You can start by picking that guy up. \n81   INT.

People are going to find out. \nBASHER Somebody must know this bloke's name. \nLIVINGSTON The question is who trained him. He got into that place alone. \nDANNY He says. \nFRANK I believed him. \nSAUL (unsettled) You think he's better than us? \nFRANK I'm not saying anything, but the man was sitting there, waiting for us. \nLINUS Do you think the cops even know who this guys is? \nRUSTY Please. That guy's never even seen a cop. \nDanny opens the door to reveal ISABEL. She looks at Danny. He looks back at her. They don't say a word. Danny motions for her to come in. \n(CONTINUED) \n85   CONTINUED:                                                   85 \nRUSTY (still glued to the TV) Who is it? \nISABEL (to Rusty) Hello, Robert. \nRusty spins to see Isabel. \nRUSTY Isabel. \nHe crosses to her.    STAY with the group for a moment. \nLINUS \"Robert?\"    Is that his real name? \nVirgil and Turk shrug. \nLINUS How does she know that? \nLIVINGSTON Ex-girlfriend. \nBASHER & SAUL Fiancee. \n86   ANGLE ON RUSTY AND ISABEL                                   86 \nThe entire group is watching them. \nRUSTY It's great to see you. \nISABEL Is it? Because you've been seeing a lot of me lately. \nShe hands a surveillance photo to Rusty. \nISABEL You were sitting in a Mercedes outside my apartment on Wednesday night. \nShe hands Rusty another photo. (These are the photos Hess the male secretary showed her at Europol HQ that we couldn't see.) \n(CONTINUED) \n86   CONTINUED:                                                   86 \nISABEL You were hiding in the bushes when I had lunch yesterday at Trattoria Bella. \nShe hands him a third photo.   Looks at the fourth. \nISABEL This one...I'm not even sure where this one was taken, but I like it a lot. Very Ron Gallela. \nShe hands this photo to Danny. It's a picture of Rusty, with a dorky look on his face, peering out from behind a mailbox he's using as cover while he spies on Isabel. \nISABEL I mean, if I didn't know better I'd think you all came here to steal the Vanderspeigle Getuigschrift, also known as the world's first stock certificate. (to the group as a whole) You must have been so proud of yourselves. A Schuman Special. It's been awhile. (smiles at Basher) That was a very handsome crossbow shot, Eugene. \nBasher winces at the sound of his real name. The group stares back at her. Can't believe this is happening. \nISABEL And the Palowski...whose idea was that? \nShe knows it was Rusty. \nRUSTY We didn't steal anything. \nISABEL Oh...I know you didn't. Somebody beat you to it. One man. No crew. No back up. Tell me something -- just so I can get the full picture in my head -- was he wearing a tuxedo? A white dinner jacket? \n(CONTINUED) \n86   CONTINUED: (2)                                             86 \nBASHER (to Isabel) At least we saw him in the flesh. You'll never see this guy your whole life. \nISABEL So you know who he is? \nDANNY Of course we know who he is. \nISABEL Well, then. I'll see you when you see him. To get your certificate back. \nShe takes the photo of Rusty peeking from behind the mailbox from Danny's hand. \nShe walks out. The group is frozen. Livingston is still looking at the pictures of Rusty following Isabel. \nLIVINGSTON (to Rusty, re: the photo) Who's hat is that? \nSAUL How did she-- That was-- \nDANNY (to Rusty) This is what I was talking about. This is exactly what I was talking-- \nRUSTY --I was just checking up on her. I knew she didn't want to see me. I was being polite. \nTURK Where did she learn all that stuff? The Palowski stuff. \nDANNY Her father. \nVIRGIL He was a cop? \nRUSTY Thief. \n(CONTINUED) \n86   CONTINUED: (3)                                                 86 \nLINUS Was he good? \nDANNY Very. \nRUSTY (V.O.) Anything else? \nBASHER (V.O.) UDC bank in Geneva, `94. Nineteen million in bearer bonds. The Louvre --'95 and twice in '96. \nYen (in V.O.) says something in Chinese. \nBASHER (V.O.) He left a Post-It note on the Mona Lisa that said \"Bitch set me up.\" \nLIVINGSTON (V.O.) Tell them about Saint Tropez. \nBASHER (V.O.) In 2000, he stole the King of Morocco's 230 foot yacht. Vanished into thin air. Crew surfaced a few days later in a life raft. Couldn't remember a thing. \n(CONTINUED) \n94   CONTINUED:                                                 94 \nSAUL (V.O.) How do you hide a two hundred foot yacht?! \nBASHER (V.O.) If the King knows, he's not telling. He received it back a month later. \n95   INTERCUT -- EXT. COTE D'AZURE -- NIGHT                    95 \nToulour. Another car. Another tux. Another beautiful woman. He pilots his convertible Maserati at high speed along the windy road. \nANOTHER BEAUTIFUL WOMAN How far is your house, Baron? \nTOULOUR Twenty minutes by helicopter. \nTURK (V.O.) One guy did all those jobs? \nVIRGIL (V.O.) How'd he get all those aliases? \nBASHER (V.O.) Until a month ago Interpol were convinced that the heists were the work of twelve different people. But not any more. \nLIVINGSTON (V.O.) The French national police just gave him a nickname. \"Le Renard Nuit\" -- The Night Fox. \n96   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                                   96 \nDanny rolls his eyes. \nBASHER Scotland Yard said he's the new LeMarc. \nRUSTY Scotland Yard never saw LeMarc. \n97   INTERCUT -- EXT. PRIVATE HELIPORT -- NIGHT                    97 \nA helicopter lands on a massive Lake Como estate.   Toulour gets out. New clothes. New woman. \nDANNY (V.O.) Personal information? \nLINUS (V.O.) Some say he's one of these guys that thinks because he was born in a penthouse, he controls the elevator business. Others say he turned out okay when you consider how rich his parents were. \nSAUL (V.O.) Taxes over here are brutal. People don't realize. \nLINUS (V.O.) Father was a big-time industrialist, got into the cellphone market on the ground floor. Mother inherited. Had maids as a child. He's a public figure, people know who he is. He's been rumored to run for office in Spain, even though he doesn't appear to live there. \n98   INTERCUT -- EXT. / INT. TOULOUR'S HOUSE -- NIGHT              98 \nToulour, in new clothes, with yet another woman, unlocks several locks and disarms two alarms.

I don't like that painting either. I don't like anything Van Gogh did. \n(CONTINUED) \n98    CONTINUED:                                                    98 \nToulour smiles and lets her in. \nLINUS (V.O.)

AMSTERDAM HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                        101 \nLINUS He's rarely alone. I think it's a compulsion. I have a list of names here...it was just the first week. \nDANNY All right, moving on, is there anything else we need to know about this guy before we-- \nBASHER Did we forget to mention he's a Viscount? \nDANNY A what? \nLIVINGSTON Viscount.    As in nobility. \n(CONTINUED) \n101   CONTINUED:                                                  101 \nDANNY (cannot take it anymore) Last time I checked titles like that went out with a little number I like to call the French Revolution-- \nDANNY We came here for the Vanderspeigle certificate-- \nTOULOUR That's not for sale. \nDANNY Your Degas is worth three times that. You want your painting back, you're going to have to trade. \nTOULOUR You actually expect me to believe that you are in possession of my Degas? You are living in a...in a bubble. \nToulour looks at them and walks away. \nCUT TO: \n110   INT. LAKE COMO HOTEL SUITE -- DAY                          110 \nRusty and Danny stand with the rest of the group. \nBASHER He used the word \"amateur\"? \nRusty and Danny nod reluctantly. \nVIRGIL You said we could show him the painting right, to prove that we had it. \nDANNY Yes. \nRUSTY He still wouldn't trade. \nYen says something. \nFRANK We need to teach him a lesson. \n(CONTINUED) \n110   CONTINUED:                                             110 \nTURK Absolutely. \nDANNY All right, let's stay calm. We don't need to over-react here. He said some disrespectful things, that's true. But why antagonize this guy? Why get into something with him? He's young and he's filthy rich, and he's got time on his hands. We don't want to become his Betty noir. We can just fence his painting and earn a lot more than we would have from the certificate. \nBASHER It's about reputation. You said so yourself. We have to get that certificate to Evelyn's buyer or-- \nDANNY We'll make enough selling the Degas to pay off her buyer-- \nFRANK Then why did you make that trip down there in the first place, if you didn't want to get into something? \nDANNY Saul? \nSAUL Turn his name over to Isabel. In exchange for getting off our backs. \nTough one to swallow. \nSAUL Short of that...the only appropriate response is to steal his next job right out from under him. Just like he did to us. \nTURK We don't even know our next job. \nDANNY We got ten million in that closet. \n(CONTINUED) \n110   CONTINUED: (2)                                              110 \nDanny points at the closet in the room. \nDANNY I cash in the Degas, take a moment to think about our next move. Toulour isn't going anywhere. You guys are hyping him too much, you're letting him get inside your head. \nEveryone agrees. \nDanny opens the closet. \nThere's a picture frame in there, but NO PICTURE. It's been stolen by Toulour. \nWe hear the SOUND OF A CASE BEING SHUT AND LOCKED. \n111   INT. PARIS BUILDING -- DAY                                  111 \nWe see a SMALL, SECURE BOX being transported to a heavily secured truck. \n112   EXT.

What's so goddamned special about the French? \nHess gives her a look as though she should know better. \nHESS Without their signatures, you can't do anything. You can't pull the suspects over, you can't do surveillance on them, you're not even allowed to contact them. They're real sticklers about sovereignty issues here. \n115   INT. PARIS BUREAUCRAT'S OFFICE -- DAY                       115 \nThe Bureaucrat looks at Isabel.

I mean, is it a fair bet or is it like...the Coronation Egg or something? \nDanny points.   That's it.   That's the one. \nSAUL He wants us to steal the Coronation Egg! \nBASHER That's just... that's...what is that? \nSAUL The Holy Grail. \nRUSTY Carl Faberge, the greatest goldsmith in history, constructed the Coronation Egg in 1896 for the wedding of Czar Nicholas and Alexandra. Every world class thief in the last 108 years has tried to steal it. No one has even come close. \nSAUL That's because it's cursed. \nLINUS What? \nSAUL It's un-stealable. \nDANNY It's the only thing in LeMarc's entire career that he went after but failed to get. He tried three times. \nA long beat of silence.... \nDANNY We get the egg and we're free. \n(CONTINUED) \n120   CONTINUED: (2)                                              120 \nBASHER That's great, except we can't get it. \nSAUL It's not possible. \nDANNY Then we go to jail. \nA beat... \nVIRGIL Well...where is it now? \n121   EXT.

Hess is in the front seat. \nISABEL I'm going to need surveillance on both hotels, phone taps, room bugs, people in the lobby and by every exit. \nCARABINIERI OFFICER Yes, absolutely. \nISABEL If I had to guess I'd say I'll need at least 25 people, a dozen vehicles...and an on-call air unit. \nCARABINIERI OFFICER Yes, absolutely. \nISABEL Okay, one more thing, and this is crucial: these guys are extremely, sophisticated at avoiding electronic surveillance, so we'll need real state of the art stuff.

Good. Now what time am I meeting Captain Giordano? \nA beat... \nCARABINIERI OFFICER (tentative) Yes... \nISABEL No, what time? \nAnother beat... \nCARABINIERI OFFICER Yes...absolutely... \nIsabel looks right at him. \nISABEL I see...so...you've spoken with the Pope and he's okay with autographing my breasts? \nHess turns around. \nCARABINIERI OFFICER Yes, absolutely. \nIsabel sighs loudly and sinks back into her seat. \n123   EXT.

Infra-red motion detectors cover the room. Motion sensitive lasers shine directly onto the egg. \nDanny, Basher, Yen, Frank, and Livingston try to figure out how to get around the security systems. \nLIVINGSTON (IN THE BACKGROUND) No, that won't work either. The IR will pick it up before you even get close. \nThis is depressing to everyone. \nFRANK Look, if we're having this much trouble, and we've got ten guys Toulour must be pulling his hair out. \n129   INTERCUT -- EXT.

They are having a loud, tense conversation in Italian. \nIsabel watches as Giordano's temper really flares.    He jabs his finger at one of the other cops. \nCAPTAIN GIORDANO (SUBTITLED) Naples sucks! They're a joke! The only decent player they have is Pasqualli -- and he's a pussy. ITALIAN COP 1 (SUBTITLED) Pasqualli runs circles around Bologna's backfield every time.

Isabel's sitting at the very same cafe reading the newspaper when she hears frantic police whistles. She looks up to see a man running down the street at full bore. As he gets closer we realize it's Rusty. Eight cops are chasing him. Rusty rushes past the cafe. As he does he notices Isabel, they make eye contact. Then he's gone. Sprints around the corner. The cops rush past her. She hears sirens converging from all directions. \n142   INT. POLICE HEADQUARTERS (STILL IN FLASHBACK)             142 \nIsabel shows her Europol identification to a detective. ISABEL Hi, this isn't official business. Actually, I'm here on vacation.

Rusty, all cleaned up now, dressed in a perfectly-tailored suit, sits down three tables away from her. She stares at him. Can't believe it. The brazenness. The audacity of this guy. Rusty doesn't seem to have a care in the world as he chats easily with the waiter, in Italian. Finally, Isabel just can't help herself.   She gets up and walks over to Rusty's table. ISABEL Excuse me... RUSTY Yes. ISABEL Um...Did I...? I think I saw you...yesterday. RUSTY Oh yeah? ISABEL The police were chasing you. RUSTY You sure your eyes aren't broken?

He is clearly handling a matter of utmost importance. Tilt down to reveal he is carrying a tiny cup of CAPPUCCINO. \n148   INT. ORNATE OFFICE OUTER OFFICE -- DAY                     148 \nThe National Police Officer blows through, passing Hess. \n149   INT. ORNATE OFFICE -- DAY                                  149 \nIsabel sits with Commander Andriotti. The office door swings open and the National Police officer walks in. He places the cappuccino on Andriotti's desk and leaves. \n150   INT. CAPTAIN GIORDANO'S OFFICE -- DAY                      150 \nGiordano sits with his feet up on his desk, smoking a cigar. \nThe door swings open and Isabel strides in, catching him completely off guard. She thrusts a piece of paper in his face. \nCAPTAIN GIORDANO What's that? \nISABEL An order signed by Commander Andriotti instructing you to \"provide any and all support that Agent Lahiri requests, whenever she requests it.\" \nShe enters the department store. \n158   INT. DEPARTMENT STORE -- DAY                                 158 \nTess shops for perfume.   The Power twins watch her from a discreet distance. \nShe smiles at them.   Then makes her way to the ladies room. \n159   INT. LADIES ROOM -- DAY                                      159 \nShe walks in and goes right for the window. She's about to open it when it opens from outside. She jumps a mile until she sees that BRUISER is there, standing in the bucket from the utilities company. \nBRUISER Hiya, Tess. Just climb on through. Try not to look down too much. \n160   EXT. DEPARTMENT STORE -- DAY                                 160 \nFour stories above an alleyway. Tess climbs out the ladies room window into the cherry picker basket, with Bruiser's help. \n161   EXT. STREET LEVEL -- A MINUTE LATER                          161 \nTess climbs into a taxi cab. Reuben -- in an anachronistic taxi driver's uniform -- is driving. \nREUBEN There's make-up in the bag there. And some photos. Do the best you can. \n162   INT. THE POSHEST ROME HOTEL -- DAY                        162 \nThe HOTEL MANAGER comes to the front desk to answer a call. \nHOTEL MANAGER Bonjourno. Yes. Yes. Oh...oh, really. Well, absolutely. We can have...I can make our presidential suite available. No, no, no. No trouble at all. We'd love... We're honored that she'd think of us... \nHe hangs up.   Turns, elated, to his front desk staff. \nHOTEL MANAGER (SUBTITLED) Julia Roberts is coming to stay with us! \n163   EXT. POSHEST ROME HOTEL -- DAY                            163 \nTess, as Julia Roberts, steps out of a Mercedes limo wearing sunglasses and carrying a puppy. Frank and Basher, as Nation of Islam bodyguards, clear a place in front of her. Reuben trails, dressed in the latest hip-hop clothes. \nA throng of fans and paparazzi rush toward her. Strobes blind us. Fans scream out her name, thrust paper and pen at her for autographs. It's a frigging madhouse. \nPRESS Ms. Roberts! Ms. Roberts! Why did you come back to Rome so soon!! \nTESS I...uh... \nPRESS Was it to see Topher? \nTESS To see what? \nPRESS Topher Grace!! Your co-star!! Is that why you're here?! \nTESS Oh. No. I came to -- to see the-- \n(CONTINUED) \n163   CONTINUED:                                                        163 \nPRESS Where's Danny? \nTESS What? \nPRESS Danny, your husband!! \nTESS (looks to Reuben) Well, he's not really-- \nREUBEN Ms. Roberts is very tired!! Please let her through! Please! \n164   INT. PRESIDENTIAL SUITE -- DAY                                   164 \nTess enters and shuts the door behind her.  She takes a deep breath and exhales. She looks up at Danny, who's there waiting for her. \nTESS I can't do this. \nDanny goes to her.    Kisses her.   Hugs her.    When he steps back he answers: \nDANNY Yes, you can. \nTESS I'm not an actress, Danny!     And I don't look like her! \nDANNY You do, Tess. You really do. I never told you that before, but it's true. \nTESS Come on: my... \nShe notions at her body, but we can't tell what part. \nTESS And my... \nShe motions at her body again; again it's totally ambiguous what part. \n(CONTINUED) \n164   CONTINUED:                                                  164 \nTESS And my ears. Anybody who sees my ears is going to know instantly. \nDANNY Nobody's looking at your ears. \nTESS Yes, Danny, they are.     They're going to know. \n165   INT. DISPLAY ROOM FOR EGG -- MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAY   165 \nIsabel stands with the MUSEUM DIRECTOR. \nISABEL When did that happen? \nThere's a knock at the door.   He opens it to see Isabel. \nISABEL You want to walk? \n174   EXT. ROME -- NIGHT                                          174 \nRusty and Isabel sit on the steps of the Campidoglio. \nISABEL I know how you're planning to do it. I know Julia's visit is the key. \nRUSTY Who's Julia? \nISABEL (after a beat) LeMarc knew when to get out. He just quit...with his perfect record intact. Now he's a legend. (exhorting) Don't do this. \nRUSTY LeMarc quit because he was 75 years old, Isabel. He was tired. His doctor told him if he didn't start taking it easy he was going to have another heart attack. You're dramatizing it. \nISABEL You don't know why LeMarc retired, any better than I do. You have no idea. \nRUSTY Actually, I do. I know exactly why. \nISABEL Really?    How's that? \n(CONTINUED) \n174   CONTINUED:                                              174 \nRUSTY He told me. \nISABEL (skeptical as hell) You know LeMarc? \nRUSTY A little. \nISABEL Since when? \nRUSTY Ten years ago. \nISABEL For how long? \nRUSTY For six months. \nISABEL You-- \nShe's so mad she can hardly speak. \nISABEL You knew LeMarc? You knew LeMarc and never told me? That's the worst thing you've ever done to me. Nobody knows more about LeMarc than me. How could you do that? \nRUSTY I couldn't tell you, then. \nISABEL Really awful. \nIsabel thinks. \nISABEL Then why aren't you as good as Toulour? \nRusty shrugs. \nA beat. \n(CONTINUED) \n174   CONTINUED: (2)                                               174 \nISABEL I don't want to arrest you, Robert. I really don't. But I will if you make me. I will if you go for that egg. \nRusty goes silent, looks out at the lights of the city. \nISABEL So many times, I waited. You can't do that to a person. \nRUSTY Isabel-- \nISABEL I have to go. \nIsabel gets up...walks away fast.    She's barely holding herself together. \nRusty watches her go.   Several seconds, then: \n175   FLASHBACK -- INT. APARTMENT BUILDING -- ROME -- DAY         175 \nRusty carries a huge bouquet of flowers up the stairs to the front door of his apartment with Isabel. It's a perfect sunny day outside. He unlocks the door quietly and swings it open to see the apartment is bare. The furniture is still there. But nothing else. Nothing on the walls or the shelves.    Isabel has clearly moved out. Rusty's whole body reacts.... He slowly looks around him, as if in a dream. His eye goes to the dining room table. Isabel's engagement ring is there. \n176   BACK TO SCENE -- EXT. ROME -- CAMPIDOGLIO -- NIGHT          176 \nRusty is still watching Isabel, small now in the distance. She turns the corner out of sight. \n177   EXT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAWN                           177 \nIsabel pulls up in her car. \n178   INT. MUSEUM OF MODERN ART -- DAWN                          178 \nThe Egg is being put into position. Isabel watches. \n179   INT. HOTEL SUITE -- DAWN                                   179 \nReuben is talking to Yen. Frank and Livingston get ready in the background. \nREUBEN You're a photographer. Very exacting. You want things a certain way, but you never raise your voice. You're uncompromising. Strong. \nFRANK Reuben, what are you doing? \nREUBEN Oh, we understand each other. I'm mean, the actual words are gibberish to me, but I know what he means. There's a tone, you know. We communicate. I'm sure he'd tell you the same thing. (to Yen) Am I right? \nYen says something in Chinese. \nISABEL I want to be on record as saying that you should have shut the entire museum down. \nIsabel keeps her eye on the tourists who circulate through the other wings of the museum. \n183   INT. MUSEUM -- ENTRY HALL -- DAY                              183 \n\"Julia\" arrives flanked by her \"Nation of Islam\" guards, Frank and Basher. The assembled employees clap and call her name. She waves as they take her picture. \nTopher throws his arm around Julia to make sure he gets in all the shots. The Museum Director comes up to greet \"Julia\". \n184   INT. SECURITY ROOM                                            184 \nIsabel watches the security camera feeds. \nISABEL There!     Right there! \nIsabel points at a screen showing the museum's other entrance. Rusty nonchalantly slips into the museum. \n185   INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY             185 \n\"Julia\" enters and walks up to the egg.       Her entourage follows. \nTESS It's so beautiful.        My God. \nTopher looks at the egg-- \nTOPHER Kinda small. \nHe turns away to look a cute girl on the museum staff. \n(CONTINUED) \n185   CONTINUED:                                                  185 \nTOPHER Hi. \nBACK ON \"JULIA\" \nShe leans in close to the egg. \nTESS I'm not going to set off any alarms? \nMUSEUM DIRECTOR No. No. Get as close as you like. \nReuben pops his head in between them. \nREUBEN (obsequious) Julia -- unless you have any objections -- Wen and his crew set up for the publicity stills. \n186   INT. ANOTHER PART OF THE MUSEUM -- DAY                     186 \nRusty ponders a painting like college student trying to impress his art history professor. Finally he moves on, into another gallery. \nPAN to REVEAL nine uniformed cops trailing behind him. \n187   INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY          187 \nYen ENTERS FRAME -- dressed like a pretentious grunge rocker. \nHe whispers Chinese into a bullhorn. \nTheoretically he's speaking to his crew (Danny, Saul, and Livingston in lame disguises) telling them where to set up the camera, lights, and flags. \nEach \"crew member\" carries an odd-looking oversized \"light meter\". Upon closer examination we can see that each device has a small TV screen on it -- which is tapped into the museum's closed circuit system. The guys are carefully placing their flags and lights so as to block the view of the egg from each of the eight cameras on the ceiling of the gallery. \n\"Studio Execs,\" Reuben and Linus go to \"Julia.\" \n(CONTINUED) \n187   CONTINUED:                                                  187 \nREUBEN I was thinking maybe we could get you and Topher into some \"You Always You Never\" hats and t-shirts for the shoot-- \nTESS That's stupid. \nREUBEN (instant reversal) So stupid! (turns to Linus as if it's his idea) Idiot. (gingerly) Maybe we could put some posters in the background-- \nTESS I don't think we want to be so obvious-- \nREUBEN I completely agree! (to Linus) Stop trying to turn this into some sort of stunt. \n188   INT. OTHER PART OF MUSEUM                                  188 \nIsabel struts up to Rusty. \nISABEL This isn't going to work. \nRUSTY I don't know what you're talking about. \n189   INT. GALLERY CONTAINING THE CORONATION EGG -- DAY          189 \nYen stands on two apple boxes to shoot photos of \"Julia\" and Topher. \"Julia\" looks ridiculously stiff and keeps putting her hands up to block her ears. \nTopher keeps shooting glances at Danny, who is moving around flags and lights, ostensibly in accordance with Yen's Chinese language orders. \n(CONTINUED) \n189   CONTINUED:                                                  189 \nJulia sees Topher's expression -- he recognizes Danny from somewhere... \nJULIA Okay, thanks everybody. Thank you so much. \nShe starts to walk out. Topher shrugs and follows her. \nHe stumbles onward and collapses into a vacant seat. \nLINUS (in French) He's completely drunk. The BackPack Kid nods his head. Linus goes back to his book. We drop down to see HIS BACKPACK also beneath his feet. \n207   INT. TRAIN STATION ROME, ITALY -- DAY                     207 \nLinus walks through the terminal, backpack over his shoulder. Suddenly he stops and kneels to tie his shoelace. \nSaul, seeing this and reacting, splits off into another direction. \n208   INT. WAREHOUSE -- DAY                                     208 \nLinus and Saul approach the group. \nDANNY What happened? \nLinus puts his BACKPACK down. \nLINUS We thought someone was following us. \n209   BACK TO TOULOUR ON VERANDA - DAY                         209 \nTOULOUR But that means you knew what to steal before LeMarc proposed that I challenge you for it. That means... \n210   INT. RUSTY'S GARAGE -- DAY                               210 \nThe image from the beginning of the film, with Rusty watching the boiling cask. He's talking on the phone. \nRUSTY Gaspar, it's Rusty. How are you? \nAnd this time we see what be is working on: \nA PERFECT REPLICA OF THE CORONATION EGG. \nIn the warehouse in NYC, we see Danny and Rusty \"arguing\", but from a different angle. They are smiling as they yell: \nDANNY I'M TELLING YOU IT'S A DEATH SENTENCE! \nRUSTY FINE, THEN STAY HERE! \n211   BACK TO TOULOUR ON VERANDA - DAY                         211 \nTOULOUR LeMarc told you. Of course. \nHe looks deflated. It's probably just occurring to him that he's never lost before. \nHe sits down. \nTOULOUR To teach me. \nHe is silent. \nTess indicates to Danny that they should leave. Danny nods, and they rise. \n(CONTINUED) \n211   CONTINUED:                                                211 \nDANNY Well, we'll be in touch to make all the arrangements. \nTOULOUR No. Don't go. Please. \nToulour gets up. \nTOULOUR You are my guests. I will celebrate your victory. Besides, you may have noticed, I don't like to be alone. \n212   EXT. VERANDA -- LATER                                    212 \nThey are toasting champagne. \nTOULOUR I am feeling more French by the minute. To my first depression. \n213   INT. TAXI -- DAY                                         213 \nSaul and Basher ride to the airport. \nBASHER So I think if you really analyze it, you can see that it's inevitable. It's time for us to evolve, en masse. I have to help bring that about whatever way I can, you know. Otherwise, the trajectory is fixed. You know what I'm saying? \nSAUL Mmm. Yes. But I'm through evolving, I think. It's too tiring. I feel pretty evolved. You know, considering. \n214   INT. AIRPORT -- DAY                                      214 \nFrank and Yen buy magazines. Yen has a copy of an ITALIAN TABLOID. The headline screams CO-STAR SAYS JULIA MARRIAGE IN TROUBLE. A sub-headline reads HER ADDICTION TO PAINKILLERS IS RIPPING THEM APART. \n215   INT. AIRPLANE -- NIGHT                                     215 \nIn First Class. Basher and Saul tip champagne glasses. \nVirgil, Turk, and Linus all crack open copies of their story to read. \nTURK I've got an idea for another Dominique story. \nVIRGIL Can we finish this one first? \nTURK Just let me tell it to you. \nVIRGIL No. \nTURK It's like three sentences. \nVIRGIL I'm serious; you're asking too much. \nVirgil puts on his headset. Turk leans over to Linus and begins to speak. Linus, reading, holds his finger up. \n", "test1_input": "OCEAN'S TWELVE \nWritten by \nGeorge Nolfi \nROUGH DRAFT \n1    A MULTI-COLORED SCREEN                                      1 \nAfter a few introductory credits, we pull back to reveal the source of this kaleidoscopic backdrop: A SINGLE, STRIPED TULIP, planted in a long row of other tulips. A HAND reaches in and pulls the tulip from the ground. We then cut to: \n1A   A BASKET of tulips, carried by hand to a truck, where it    1A is loaded with hundreds of other baskets. The door of the truck is SHUT and we cut to: \n1B   The door of the truck OPENING to reveal that the tulips    1B are now boxed and crated. A forklift moves the crates onto a wagon, which is driven by a MANNED CART across the biggest warehouse on the planet, the Bloenen Markt (CHECK THIS-- steven) in Amsterdam, Netherlands. The cart and wagons we were following disappear into a maze of synchronized activity. \n1C   The cart arrives in the AUCTION ROOM, which is             1C constructed like an ampitheater: the buyers sit in a steeply raked semi-circle, facing two giant, clock-shaped scoreboards that display the bids on the flowers being viewed. The striped tulips fetch a very high price. \n1D   The carts of striped tulips are delivered to an automated 1D sorting apparatus of enormous size and complexity. They end up on a truck heading for the airport. \n1E   The tulips are loaded onto a plane. During the transatlantic flight, they sit nestled in the cargo hold. \n1F   The tulips are unloaded from the plane, driven across an    1F airport tarmac and loaded onto another plane. \n1G   The tulips are unloaded from the plane and loaded onto a   1G truck.

The flaws create the unusual coloring. \nCUSTOMER Can you arrange something for me with those? \nOWNER Of course. What kind of price range are you looking for? \nNow we SEE the customer: TESS. \nTESS Well, it's for my parent's anniversary. They don't know I'm coming. I just want it to be beautiful. Can you just do whatever you think looks best? \nOWNER I'll need a few minutes. \nTESS Take your time, please. And thank you. \nThe Owner moves toward a corner of the store where the flowers are arranged. Tess walks around, looking at the rest of the store. \nTess looks out the window. A black sedan is pulling up at the curb. \nOWNER That should be some surprise. \nTESS Which? \nOWNER For your parents. \nTESS Oh. Yes. I hope so. \nOne of the POWER TWINS gets out of the driver's side door and crosses in front of the car.

It's unisex. \nTESS Thank you. \nTess scurries to the back. \nOWNER (to Tess, a caveat) It's unisex! \nTess flies past the bathroom and heads for the back door.

Wait a minute. That's it? \nDANNY Yeah. \nLINUS Look, you guys no frills, no perks, run-and-gun, all that stuff, and I said no problem because I believed you were right that we shouldn't go deeper into debt and spend money we don't have. I mean, am I the only one who thinks this might actually be a good thing? That we could use a little humility? That maybe we were a little too pleased and impressed with ourselves after the Benedict job? Okay, I grant you that maybe this isn't what we deserve, but maybe it's what we need. We can do this.

Later he will wake up in front of the television but not remember his dream. \nEvelyn nods and looks to Linus, as do Danny and Rusty. He furrows his brow, then speaks: \nLINUS O let the sun beat down upon my face, stars to fill my dreams.

But you lost his card. \nToulour holds out another card to Danny. \nDANNY No, nothing like that. We just came to collect our money. \nTOULOUR Not only did you fail, half of your crew got pinched!

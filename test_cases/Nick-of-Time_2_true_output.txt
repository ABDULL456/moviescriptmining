GENE I'm serious, honey. Don't get out of my sight, all right? I want you to stay right by me. Will you do that for me? 
LYNN Nods solemnly. GENE reaches the platform and gives out an exaggerated sigh. 
GENE We made it. 
LYNN nods back. 
LYNN We made it. 
INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:08PM 
WHOOSH! A SECURITY GUARD approaches the two ROLLERBLADING TEENS. They circle him, toss off a few taunts and roll away, laughing. 
MR. SMITH and MS. JONES continue trolling the PASSENGERS as they come through the gate. 
MS. JONES Skate-boarders I don't mind, even though they dress like fuckin' idiots, but when I see some pin-head on rollerblades, I get the definite urge to grease the grill of my car with 'em. 
MR. SMITH Keep your eyes peeled. 
MS. JONES What about them? 
MR. SMITH Too old. 
They're talking about a COUPLE IN THEIR SIXTIES, warmly greeting each other. 
MR. JONES Him! 
MR. SMITH If you ever had an idea it would die of malnutrition. First those blue hairs then some Spic.  Leave this to me. I know people. It's my job. I'm a people person. 
MR. SMITH laughs at his joke. 
MS. JONES What the fuck are you looking for? 
MR. SMITH has spotted someone. 
MR. SMITH I'm looking for them. 
MS. JONES Where? 
MR. SMITH Right there. 
He starts walking towards the exit gate. 
INT. UNION STATION -ARRIVAL CONCOURSE - DAY - 12:09PM 
GENE has emerged with LYNN. They pause there, getting their bearings. Next to them, a YOUNG COUPLE is kissing. They can't keep their hands off each other. 
GENE I gotta make a phone call, Lynn. Do you see a phone? 
LYNN has seen the YOUNG COUPLE. She secretly points to them, covers her mouth, and does a "tee, hee, hee" number. GENE laughs. 
GENE Come on, you. 
They start walking across the concourse, towards MR. SMITH and MS. JONES. 
GENE (to LYNN) Haven't you ever seen anybody kiss like that? 
LYNN On TV. 
GENE You never saw your Mom and me kiss like that? 
LYNN suddenly gets very sad. She looks at the ground, slows down. GENE notices. He stops, crouches down to her level. MR. SMITH and MS. JONES, nearing them, split apart, move around them, and keep going. 
GENE (to LYNN) Hey, it's OK to talk about her. You can talk about her all you want. You know that, don't you? 
LYNN nods. 
GENE So, come on. You never saw us kiss like that? 
LYNN No way. 
GENE How did you see us kiss? 
LYNN gives her own hand a little peck of a kiss. 
GENE That's it? That little peck of a kiss? Oh, brother, you missed some kisses.

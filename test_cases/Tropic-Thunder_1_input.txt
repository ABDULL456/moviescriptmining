INT. SPEEDMAN'S CELL -- CONTINUOUS 
Lazarus is right in Speedman's face. He seems to be getting clearer... 
LAZARUS The world needs you! It` needs its stars! You make people forget how awful and 1ï¿½ I Ii I. 1 ,14M depressing their lives are! People love your work! And... I love your work, too. Speedman is quiet. 
SPEEDMAN I Uhhhh-uh-I'm... Spah-speeedman? 
LAZARUS Simple Jack was magnificent! 
SANDUSKY Is it working? 
LAZARUS JESUS! Give me time, Sandusky! I'm not re- programming a VCR!! (back to Speedman) You really committed yourself. And for that you DESERVED AN OSCAR! Speedman registers this. 
LAZARUS 
(FRUSTRATED) 
C'MON CHRIS! DAMMIT! YOU MUST KNOW WHO 
YOU ARE! Lazarus's own words make him stop and think. 
LAZARUS (almost to himself) You know who you are... . you do Chris. Long beat. 
LAZARUS Unlike me. What am I doing? I can't do this. How can I convince a man he is who we know he is, when I can't even convince myself of the same thing. He lets go of Speedman, and begins to break down.

REDYKULOUS Yo, c'mon, man! Why is everybody gettin'. so insecure alla a sudden?! You're Kirk Lazarus! You're like the greatest actor in the motherfuckin' world! 
SANDUSKY Guys, let's go, we gotta get outta here! I it I. 11h.4% 
LAZARUS Am I Redykulous? ... AM I!...Or.am I just acting like that's who I am? No. The sad fact is... I'm not Sergeant Osiris. . .or Father O'Malley ...or' Neil .Armstrong. I'm not even .Kirk Lazarus. (a beat) I have no idea who I am. The guys look at him... it's the first time he has let his guard down. 
SANDUSKY Kirk, this is NOT the time! 
LAZARUS And I guess when you-do themath... .and boil it all down, I've invented myself so many times... .became so many people... .that at the end of the.day...I'm 
NOBODY.' 
REDYKULOUSI Bull-s-hit! Y-ou-l-isten to-me .-.-Y-ou-a-r-e-who you want to be, and you-have to OWN. THAT! Look at me! I'm GAY and, I'm proud! He winks at Sandusky. 
REDYKULOUS That's right! We're.not what we're called, or who we pretend to be. We are what we are in our hearts. And to me, looking into your heart, you're a hero.. Lazarus looks to Redykulous. 
LAZARUS You mean that?

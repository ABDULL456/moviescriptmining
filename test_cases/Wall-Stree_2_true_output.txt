Carl steps into the elevator, Bud follows. 
CARL He's got your prick in his back pocket, son, and you're standing naked in the display window of Macy's. He's using you. Only you're too blind to see it. 
BUD No, what I see is a jealous old machinist who can't stand that his son's become more successful than himself. 
CARL What you see, son, is a man who never measured success by the size of a man's wallet. 
BUD That's because you never had the guts to go out into the world and stake your claim. 
CARL (lamentably) Boy, if that's what you think, I must've really screwed up my job as a father. 
INT. BUILDING LOBBY - NIGHT 
Bud and Carl exit the elevator and head across the luxury lobby. 
CARL (CONT'D) ...as far as being axed, I'm still here and as long as I am, I have a responsibility not just to me but to the union members I represent... 
BUD (pleading now) Your responsibility, Dad, is to present the facts, not your opinions, to the men... you're gonna destroy their lives, Dad! Don't do it to 'em. Give it a chance. Let the membership decide for themselves, Dad. Please. 
CARL I'll be damned that when my men come to me tomorrow morning, wanting to know what's going on, I'm going to lie to them! 
BUD Your men! All my life "your men" have been able to count on you? Why is it that you've never been there for me? 
They head through the doors, out onto the street. 
EXT. BUILDING - NIGHT 
Bud following Carl. 
BUD And what if you're wrong? What if one day, the sun didn't rise in the East and birds didn't fly South in winter and for once in your life your compass was off? Huh? 
He grabs Carl by the arm, stopping him. 
BUD (CONT'D) Would you be willing to wreck your men's future? My future? Please... Dad. Think. Be practical, for a change. I'm asking you, I'm fucking begging you... 
Bud lets go of Carl's arm. Carl looks at his son, seeing the desperation. Sadness and confusion take hold of him. 
CARL I don't sleep with no whore and I don't wake up with no whore. That's how I live with myself, Buddy. I don't know how you do. (a beat) I hope I'm wrong, I'll let them decide for themselves, that much I promise you. 
He walks away. Bud watches him go, knows he has won. 
INT. BUD'S OFFICE - DAY 
Bud, increasingly frazzled and determined, dark circles under his eyes paces with the phone... 
JANET (his secretary) Mr. Dixon Brandt on 3... 
BUD (wearily switching over) What's up Dixon? (stopping, focusing) Calm down! What are you talking about? 
INTERCUT TO: 
INT. DIXON'S CABIN - ASPEN COLORADO - DAY 
Dixon, the rich man's son and ski bum, is yelling on the other end of the line. 
DIXON ...this guy who said he was from the Security Exchange Commission, whatever the hell that is, calls and wants to ask me about that stock I bought... 
BUD (nervous) What'd you tell him? 
DIXON I told him I was in the bathroom and I'd call him right back. What the hell was I supposed to say Buddy, you got me into... 
BUD Look Dixon, calm down! It's not illegal to buy stock or to be right. And it's not all that unusual to be spot checked on a big buy. Tell him you did your homework and you thought the stock was a sound investment. 
DIXON What if he asks where I got the money? 
BUD Tell 'em your father gave it to you. 
DIXON What if they call him? 
BUD They won't. That's not their jurisdiction. 
DIXON You sure?

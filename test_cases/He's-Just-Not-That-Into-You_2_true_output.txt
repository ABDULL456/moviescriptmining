CATHERINE Why didn't you tell us?    You should have told us. 
LAURA You have to come over and have dinner with me and Steven and the kids tonight, OK? You can even stay over if you want. 
CATHERINE Why would she want to hang out with us and our husbands? Seriously, Beth, isn't that exactly what you want to avoid right now? 
But before Beth can even answer -- 
PAIGE You know what - if being in the wedding is too painful- 
BETH You guys, it's cool. I'm fine.    So I lost a little time. Big deal. 
Beth grabs her purse and starts for the door. 
CATHERINE So not a big deal. You're still really young. 
PAIGE So young. 
LAURA Everything you learned in that relationship is just gonna make the next one so much stronger. 
BETH Exactly. 
Beth exits, still wearing a half-sewn bridesmaid's dress. 
LAURA She wasted so much time. 
CATHERINE I knew he was never gonna propose. 
PAIGE Shit. 
The girls nod in agreement. 
INT. LAW OFFICE - DAY 
Ben sits behind his desk, sifting through a pile of papers. We PAN around to Anna sitting across from him. 
BEN I know it's here somewhere. I spoke to George Lane in music, and he gave me this whole list of references for you. 
ANNA It's cool.    You can call me when you find it. 
BEN I swear I didn't lure you here under false pretenses. 
ANNA I know.   But a girl can dream. 
He looks up at her and smiles. 
ANNA (CONT'D) You're obviously too good of a guy. 
They share a LONG LOOK. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Why are you married, again? 
Ben LAUGHS. 
ANNA (CONT'D) Seriously. Why? It'll be good for me. Tell me how you decided that you could not be without this other woman. 
BEN We'd been together since college. She gave me an ultimatum: we get married or we break up. So, we got married. 
ANNA Seriously?   You just caved? 
BEN It's complicated. 
ANNA Really? 
BEN You're a dick if you date a girl for too long, and don't marry her. But you marry her, and then you're an asshole for marrying her before you're ready. Shit - I don't know. 
He looks at her. 
BEN (CONT'D) You're really hot and I'm obviously attracted to you, but I guess the best I can do is eventually find this piece of paper, and call you, and hope I help in some small way with your career, and be happy about that. 
Anna takes this in. 
INT. HIGHLANDTOWN HOUSE - DAY 
Janine walks in from work to her construction site home. She peeks into the dining room, where she sees her CHERRY WOOD DINING TABLE covered in a THICK LAYER OF DUST. 
JANINE 
JAVIER! 
She waits for a response. Nothing.    She starts to brush the dust off with her hands. 
JANINE (CONT'D) 
JAVIER. I THOUGHT WE TALKED ABOUT 
TARPING THE FURNITURE. 
Still nothing. So Janine drops her work things, and heads out the side door of the house to a STORAGE AREA. 
EXT. STORAGE AREA - DAY

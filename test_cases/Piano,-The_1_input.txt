Sc 14     EXT     BEACH                         DUSK     Sc 14 
There is just a pink streak left in the sky. ADA and FLORA shelter inside their make-shift tent, a hooped petticoat secured at the edges with stones.  Inside the tent a candle lights up their conversation. 
ADA is hand signaling a story to FLORA who lies back watching, nervous and afraid. ADA's whole self is involved in the "telling", her face is alight with expression, now tender, now sad, now humorous, now soft, while her hands and fingers are deft and precise. From outside it is an odd shadow play. 
FLORA (hand signaling) Mother... I'm thinking 
ADA pauses. 
(speaking) I'm not going to call him Papa.  I'm not going to call HIM anything. I'm not even going to look at HIM. 
Sc 15     EXT     BUSH ON WAY TO BEACH          DAY     Sc 15 
Through a dense bush walk a party of fourteen MAORI people and two EUROPEAN MEN. The wetness, closeness and darkness of the bush is such that the air seems green, like at the bottom of a deep sea. Two of the MAORIS share one pair of shoes and all of them are clothed in a mixture of native and European costume. Of the Europeans one is small and has a shy manner. He has a half completed Maori tattoo across his cheeks. The other is a similar age about 45 and wears a suit, muddy and out of place here in the bush. He staggers, spurts forward then slows to a stop. His hair and face are wet and his skin reflects the green foliage. BAINES the younger man turns and slows. 
BAINES Are we stopping?... Do you want to stop? 
The MAORI voices and laughter are becoming fainter. BAINES watches torn between his concern for STEWART and the split in their party. 
3-See Notes 
BAINES Shall we stop? 
Unable to get an answer BAINES runs after the MAORIS. 
BAINES Tai hoa! Me tatari tatou .., me tutatou I konei. (Wait! We are stopping.. we're stopping.) SUBTITLED 
STEWART takes out a comb and drags it dazed and zombie like through his wet hair. Inside the darkness of his pocket, he turns over and over a small, worn edged photograph, a smudge of green light allows us to see ADA's tumbling face. Taking it in the heel of his hand he secretly looks at it. Just as the party return and settle he stares on ahead possessed and determined. 
STEWART We must get on. 
The MAORIS look at BAINES bewildered. 
TAME Aue tepatupsiarehe! (The fairy people, what can you expect?) SUBTITLED 
Sc 16     EXT     BEACH                     MORNINGSc 16 
It is early morning. The sea is calmer and the tide is again low. The party or two EUROPEANS and fourteen MAORI MEN and WOMEN come out on to the beach. About half the MAORI party head straight for the shoreline where an older woman loudly organises a pipi collection. All sorts of containers are used from flax baskets to shirts with knots in their arms. The rest follow STEWART and BAINES over to the boxes. STEWART automatically re-combs his hair, patting it against his forehead, where it sticks in a raked pattern. On his head he carefully places a formal top hat, oddly dean compared to his mud splattered suit. The party stops short of the petticoats where a tell-tale foot reveals its occupants. 
STEWART Miss McGrath, Alisdair Stewart. You'll have to wake yourself. I've got men here to carry your things. 
ADA and FLORA struggle up to find themselves confronted by a group of men and women. The MAORIS stare curiously and comment on the women. 
Aut he anahera enci? (Are they angels, they look like angels.) SUBTITLED 
A man points at FLORA's feet and gestures as if holding one of the little shoes in his hand. 
Te monohi hoki! (So small!) SUBTITLED 
FLORA is struck by shyness and hides under her mother's skirt. ADA cannot look straight at STEWART and STEWART also cannot look at her. 
STEWART I see you have a good many boxes, I'd like to know what is in each. 
As ADA does not move STEWART is puzzled. 
STEWART CAN - YOU - HEAR - ME?

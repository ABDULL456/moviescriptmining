{"train": "15 Minutes \nFADE IN \non the words CZECH AIRLINE.  We are panning across the words on the side of the plane. \nINT. AIRPLANE \nANGLE DOWN \non a tray table.  Crumpled Czech bills and coins are on it. Hands are counting the money.  The airline hostess announces the arrival at JFK - in CZECH.  A hand reaches into a breast pocket - pulling out two passports.  One is opened.  Belongs to EMIL SLOVAK.  The next passport belongs to OLEG RAZGUL. The hand passes the Oleg Razgul passport to the man next to him.  We notice several empty airline bottles of vodka and a small disposable camera on Oleg's tray table.  The passport is set down.  Oleg picks it up.  We hear Emil's voice in CZECH.  The scene is subtitled in ENGLISH. \nEMIL (V.O.) Just do what I do.  Say the same thing I say.  Don't open your mouth. \nOLEG (V.O.) Okay. \nINT. PASSPORT CONTROL - KENNEDY AIRPORT - DAY \nCAMERA DOLLIES down a long line of passengers.  They are split into two lines - one for Americans, the other for visitors.  CAMERA finally arrives at EMIL SLOVAK.  An unshaven Czech in his mid-30's.  Tall, scraggly beard. Piercing blue eyes.  He's dressed in an outdated suit.  His eyes are alert, cunning and smart. \nOLEG RAZGUL, stands in line behind Emil.  Oleg is big.  Not tall - but wide.  A wrestler's body.  Emil looks at Oleg. (The following is in CZECH and subtitled in ENGLISH.) \nEMIL Don't fool around. \nOLEG Okay. \nOleg holds up his disposable camera - at arms length - to take a picture of himself. \nEMIL Did you hear what I said? \nOLEG I want to document my trip to America. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER Next. (Emil steps up) Could I see your documents, please? \nEMIL Yes sir. \nHe hands the passport to the officer who runs it through an image swipe.  Emil glances furtively back to Oleg. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER What is your intended purpose of your visit to the United States? \nEMIL Two weeks holiday. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER How much money are you carrying with you? \nEMIL I have five-hundred dollars. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER Can you show me?  Sir, no cameras in the FIS area! \nOleg was about to take a picture of Emil and the Immigration Officer.  Oleg puts the camera away.  Smiles sheepishly. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER (CONT'D) (to Emil) Is he with you?  Are you travelling together? \nEMIL Yes. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER Please join us. (to Oleg) Come on forward. \nEMIL Is there a problem? \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER No, you're travelling together.  I want to talk to you together.  Hi, how are you?  Can I take a look at your documents? (takes Oleg's passport) Are you related? \nOLEG Yes...he's my friend. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER Okay.  You're a Czech national and you're a Russian national.  How do you know one another? \nOleg starts to speak, but Emil cuts him off. \nEMIL We are both from Prague. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER (to Oleg) How long are you planning to stay? \nEMIL Two weeks. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER I'd like to speak for himself, okay? \nEMIL He doesn't speak English. \nOLEG I speak English. \nIMMIGRATION OFFICER (to Oleg) Then answer my questions.  Where were you planning to stay during the two weeks that you're here? \nLEON (CONT'D) Yeah? \nHAWKINS Paulie, you've got kids, right? \nPAULIE My kids don't talk to me anymore but they were great when they were young. \nLEON (into the phone) Sure it's him?  Great! (collapses the phone) Unique's home. \nThey all rise from the table. \nEDDIE Paulie, I need the cure. \nPAULIE Step into my office. \nLeon and Hawkins sit back down as Eddie and Paulie leave. \nHAWKINS So you got your kids listening to Opera? You still singing in the church on the weekends? \nINT. SECONDARY IMMIGRATION OFFICE - DAY \nNow other officers are questioning Emil and Oleg.  They've been there a while.  The SECONDARY OFFICER is looking Oleg. \nSECONDARY OFFICER Okay.  You work in a vodka factory.  I understand that. (to Emil) And what kind of work do you do? \nEMIL I am butcher. \nSECONDARY OFFICER You're a butcher?  What do you use pig intestines for? \nEMIL You stuff sausage in it. \nSECONDARY OFFICER And what do you do with the bones? \nEMIL Dog food. \nEmil looks at Oleg.  Blaming his stupid responses at Passport Control for their detainment. \nSECONDARY OFFICER Are you married? \nEMIL No.  Are you proposing? \nANGLE UP \nthrough a thousand ICE CUBES.  A face plunges towards us... \nINT. MENS ROOM \nEddie has his back to us as he dunks his face into a sink full of ice.  He dries his face, looks into his bloodshot eyes.  Presents a small black ring box to the mirror. \nEDDIE Will you marry me?  Wanna get married? What are you doin' Saturday? \nLeon enters.  Eddie turns. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I'm gonna propose. \nLEON When? \nEDDIE Tomorrow.  At lunch. \nLEON You ready? \nEddie leans back and drops some Visine in his eyes.  Turns. \nEDDIE The thrill of the hunt.  I love it. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - DAY \nOleg and Emil stare at the bright lights - all the nonstop action.  Each stands with an old suitcase. \nOLEG (in Russian) Look.  Times Square.  Just like in the movies! \nEMIL (in Czech) Don't speak Russian! \nOLEG (in Russian) Why?  Why do I always have to speak to you in Czech? \nEMIL (in Czech) Because I don't like your ugly language. I heard enough of it in school!  Now speak Czech or English.  And don't fool around anymore.  You almost got us thrown out! \nEmil pulls out an envelope with Milos' address on it.  This is who they came to see.  Emil hails a CAB.  Oleg is staring inside a camera store - at himself on a monitor.  A videocamera's pointed out in the street. \nOLEG Look.  New videocameras.  Color viewfinder.  Image stabilization. Solarization.  Night vision. \nEXT. EAST SIDE - LATE DAY \nThe cab is in front of an old five-story brownstone.  Oleg gets the bags out of the trunk as Emil tucks the envelope into his jacket, then steps up to the old building.  He looks back at Oleg - who's VIDEOTAPING him. \nEMIL Turn that off!  Get the bags. \nOLEG Why should I carry your bag?  I am not a dog. \nEMIL For five years I paid for your stupidness - you'll carry my bag for the rest of my life if I say so. (challenging) Unless you refuse, Oleg. \nOleg looks at Emil.  Even though Oleg is stronger than Emil, he fears him.  He picks up both bags.  Emil searches the occupant list over the buzzers to the apartment building. \nEMIL (CONT'D) There.  5RW. \nEmil pushes ten of the buzzers except 5RW.  A BUZZER clicks and Emil pushes it open. \nINT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - STAIRWELL - DAY \nThe brownstone has no elevator so Emil and Oleg climb the stairs... Oleg cradling his camera.  Emil notices a crack pipe on the floor and picks it up.  Smells the bowl. \nOLEG What? \nEMIL Smell like chemicals...for smoking drugs. \nEmil pockets the pipe and climbs to the top floor, moving down the dirty hallway to a corner door. \nINT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - DAY \nHe KNOCKS...FOOTSTEPS approach.  The door is opened by MILOS - a 40-year-old Czech, dressed in stained plumbers overalls. He  is surprised to see Emil and Oleg in his doorway.  Oleg films him... \nMILOS Emil???! \nEMIL Surprise!  Surprise! \nMilos shoots a look across the tiny kitchen to TAMINA, his comely wife. \nINT. MILOS' APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nEmil pushes his way inside.  Oleg follows.  Milos wears plumbers overalls but Emil notices sports a Rolex.  Tamina has on a faded dress but despite their cheaply furnished apartment she wears an expensive brushed gold necklace, bracelet and big pearl earrings.  The room is furnished with kitsch from Disney World and Las Vegas.  The only anomaly is a HUGE SONY TRINITRON HOME ENTERTAINMENT CENTER.  (The following is in Czech and subtitled in English.) \nEMIL Your sister said she didn't know where you were so you shouldn't write to her with return address if you're hiding. \nMILOS Did you hurt her? \nEMIL You know me...I never hurt anybody. Where's the money? \nOLEG Hello, Tamina. \nOleg is looking Tamina over.  Milos - though scared - barks at Oleg. \nMILOS Take your eyes off her, Oleg! (to Emil) Look.  It wasn't my fault you two were caught. (of Oleg) It's his fault.  Trying to get the bank clerk's phone number?!  I wasn't going to wait!!! \nEMIL Milos.  Get my money! \nOleg videotapes the scene. \nCLOSE ON AN AJAR DOOR \nAll we see behind it is a WOMAN'S FACE and her wet hair - she obviously came from the shower and we see the towel wrapped around her. \nMILOS (nervously) We spent it! \nEMIL Ha. Ha. \nMILOS Look at the way we live.  I'm a plumber. You think I'd be working if I had money?! \nEmil, pissed, moves to a wood block and pulls out a KITCHEN KNIFE.  He grabs Tamina roughly, putting the blade to her throat. \nMILOS (CONT'D) Emil.  Put down the knife. \nMilos looks at his wife - who is terrified. \nMILOS (CONT'D) Emil.  I'll help you. \nMilos closes the gap between him and Emil - trying to calm him by talking softly. \nMILOS (CONT'D) I can get you a job. \nEMIL A job? \nLOUIE Lieutenant - take up your line and relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top floor. \nJORDY Hey, Louie, were you first due? \nLOUIE Yeah, I radioed you guys right away 'cause you got two roasts on the top floor but you don't hafta investigate cause homicide is up there. \nJORDY Homicide?  Who let them up?  I didn't make it a crime scene yet. \nLOUIE Hey, it's Eddie Flemming. \nKORFIN (O.S.) Yo, Jordy! \nBOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a turnout coat. \nKORFIN (CONT'D) Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity! \nJORDY I heard.  Who the hell let them up there? \nKORFIN I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph? \nJORDY You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious? \nKORFIN Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here. \nJORDY Oh yeah, why? \nKORFIN 'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now! \nINT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe roof is gone.  The sky is exposed.  It's charred ruins, smoked beams and watery muck.  Eddie and Leon are standing by what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's charred bodies.  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar, listening to Leon. \nLEON So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine position - that they were doin' each other but were so whacked out of their heads they set the pipe on the mattress, lit it up, and they got fried.  What do you think, Eddie? \nJordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can. \nEDDIE I don't know.  We got the experts here. Show them what you found - I hope you don't mind, we came over to see if we could help. \nKorfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the celebrity. \nKORFIN Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie. \nJORDY Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents. \nEDDIE Oh, sure. \nEddie puts his cigar out.  Carefully slides it into a cigar holder and pockets it to finish later. \nLEON Well, I found - check it out - crack pipe.  Looks like they got careless. \nLeon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs.  Korfin shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe. \nLEON (CONT'D) Mind not shining that light in my eyes? \nKORFIN Sorry, bro. \nJORDY Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do. \nEDDIE No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon? \nLEON No.  Go ahead. \nJORDY Thanks.  Appreciate it. \nJordy throws a look at Korfin.  Homicide detectives have no respect for fire marshals' investigative skills.  Eddie rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes. \nKORFIN Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got good patterns - about thirty minutes old. \nJordy moves to one of the corpses.  He pulls on a white rubber glove.  Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth.  The glove comes out white. \nJORDY Mouth's clean, too. \nKORFIN Clean? \nJORDY Don't blow your nose! \nJordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose. \nJORDY (CONT'D) The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run. \nEXT. CENTRAL PARK - LATER \nKorfin's car SCREECHES to a stop.  Jordy leaps out. Suddenly, Jordy stops...the Mugger handcuffed to the tree is now NAKED! \nMUGGER You motherfuckin' bastard!  She stripped me!  It was a bag lady!  She touched me all over, it was disgusting. \nJordy unlocks the handcuffs. \nJORDY I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry. \nKorfin delivers a blanket.  Jordy covers him. \nJORDY (CONT'D) You okay? \nMUGGER A dog pissed on me!!  I'm gonna sue you for this!  You violated my civil rights! \nJORDY Your civil rights?!  You tried to rob me!  I could arrest you right now! You're lucky you're walking away from this.  Now get outta here. \nJordy gives him a push.  The Mugger wraps the blanket around himself cursing - hurrying away. \nEXT. 8TH AVENUE - NIGHT \nExhausted HOOKERS who have worked all night loiter outside a sleazy hotel.  CAMERA PANS up to a blinking hotel sign. \nINT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT \nThe light is blinking an eerie green and yellow light into the room.  Emil is at the window pulling the blind down trying to shut out the blinking light.  He pulls it down twice and it pops back up both times.  The third time he angrily pulls it so hard, it comes off the window completely. He sits down in a chair in frustration - adjusting a pillow behind his back.  THE ROSEANNE SHOW is on TV.  Roseanne has been talking to a FATHER. \nROSEANNE (ON T.V.) So you slept with your son's wife! What's that all about? \nFATHER (ON T.V.) I take full responsibility for sleepin' with my daughter in law.  I had low self esteem, I thought I had to compete with him. \nEmil reaches for his dictionary. \nEMIL (mutters) Self-esteem?  Self-esteem?? \nHe flips through his dictionary to find the meaning of self esteem. \nFATHER (ON T.V.) Losin' my job and everything, caused my behavioral disorder. (turns to his son) Forgive me, Kirk.  Let me hug you? \nThe audience boos.  Roseanne mediates... \nOleg - fresh from the shower with wet hair - sits on the bed in his skivvies - staring into the videocamera's LCD screen - rewinding Milos' murder.  We see it now for the first time - as he rewinds it.  Oleg watches - a bottle of cheap vodka between his legs.  Emil, looks up from his dictionary.  He's wearing Milos' Rolex. Tamina's jewelry - her brushed gold necklace and pearl earrings - are in front of him with Daphne's wallet.  Emil looks up - Oleg is holding his videocamera. \nEMIL (Czech) Turn that fucking thing off! \nOLEG (Czech) I'm not filming.  I'm watching Milos die.  It's just like a move but realer. \nEmil grabs the videocamera. (Czech) Don't break it!  Don't break it! \nEMIL Speak English! \nOLEG (English) You said speak Czech! \nEMIL How you erase this? \nOLEG I'll do it.  Don't hurt my camera! \nEmil tosses the camera back to Oleg who drops his vodka bottle in order to catch the camera.  Oleg, holding the camera like it's gold, goes to the dresser and puts it away. Emil starts to go through Daphne's wallet. \nEMIL Stupid, Milos.  I didn't want to kill him. (noticing) What's this? \nEmil found the last card in the wallet.  It's pink with a picture of a busty globe.  Printed in the middle is - WORLDLY ESCORTS - and a number. \nEMIL (CONT'D) Worldly escorts? \nEmil picks up his dictionary and begins to flip the pages - finding the meaning of worldly.  He gets up and dials the number.  A soft, SEXY VOICE answers.  Soft music in the background. \nSEXY VOICE Hi? \nEMIL Hello? \nSEXY VOICE Are you looking for companionship? \nOleg, who's listening, moves to Emil. \nOLEG Whore? \nEMIL I'm homesick.  You have Eastern European girl?  A Czech girl? \nMAX That's it.  I'm suing. \nKORFIN Get in line. \nKorfin takes over - throwing him out.  Jordy turns to Garcia who is laughing. \nJORDY What's so funny.  How does he know so much about me?  Who tells him my life story? \nGARCIA He hangs around downstairs.  The guys talk to him.  He's a joke... \nJORDY He's no joke!  One day he's gonna graduate from trash can fires and do something big. \nGARCIA Okay.  Okay.  We'll ban him from the station. \nINT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - TV SET - NIGHT \nAs the \"Top Story\" logo is splashed across the screen, accompanied by a catchy TV THEME, Robert Hawkins introduces America's highest rated 'news magazine' show. \nROBERT HAWKINS Good evening, I'm Robert Hawkins and this is Top Story.  Tonight we bring you an exclusive interview with Stephen Geller - who horrified the nation two years ago when he went berserk and murdered three clerks in a Manhattan shoe store.  But now, Mr. Geller's claim, spoken softly and articulately, is that he is the victim.  According to Mr. Geller, the events of that fateful day were not his fault but were the fault of his psychiatrist.  Hard to believe...watch. \nEMIL (O.S.) Louder. \nVIDEOCAMERA SLOWLY ZOOMS OUT and PANS over to Emil, sitting on the hotel bed watching the TV.  He looks at us. \nEMIL (CONT'D) Louder. \nOleg's hand reaches in front of the lens - turning up the volume.  The scene cuts back to Stephen Geller being interviewed by Robert Hawkins and his camera crew.  He's sitting on the front lawn of a mental institution in a paint stained shirt.  A showing of his artwork is displayed in the background.  Patients peruse the paintings of weird dysfunctional faces that avoid eye contact.  One of the paintings depicts Eddie Flemming and Leon Jackson. \nSTEPHEN GELLER This had nothing to do with shoes that didn't fit or my relationship with my father who, as you know, made a fortune selling penny loafers in the fifties. These people died because of the criminal actions of my doctor. \nROBERT HAWKINS Your doctor? \nSTEPHEN GELLER Yes.  My psychiatrist didn't insist that I stay on my medication. \nROBERT HAWKINS ...so you feel absolutely no responsibility for killing these people? \nSTEPHEN GELLER It was my finger that pulled the trigger, but I'm not morally responsible.  My psychiatrist knew what I was capable of.  How could I know. I'm not a doctor. \nROBERT HAWKINS You seem very savvy for a man who's been found mentally incompetent to stand trial. \nSTEPHEN GELLER Look, I'm a victim here, too.  I was a year away from getting my masters in Art, now I'll never graduate.  My life has been permanently disrupted. \nROBERT HAWKINS Permanently disrupted?  Aren't you selling paintings now for quite a lot of money?  Hasn't this 'incident' as you call it, jump started your career as an artist? \nSTEPHEN GELLER Look, I'm in here.  You call this a career move? \nROBERT HAWKINS And isn't there a movie in the works about you? \nSTEPHEN GELLER We're in negotiations, that's correct. \nROBERT HAWKINS But doesn't the Son of Sam Law prevent criminals from profiting from their crimes? \nSTEPHEN GELLER That doesn't apply to me because I'm not a criminal.  I'm not a criminal!  I wasn't convicted. \nEmil leans forward - listening.  Fascinated. \nEMIL I love America.  No one is responsible for what they do. \nThere's a KNOCK on the door.  Our VIDEOCAMERA POV swings over to it.  Then WHIPS back to Emil.  Emil looks at us. \nEMIL (CONT'D) Get in the bathroom! \nOLEG (O.S.) Whatever we do - we fuck her, right? \nEMIL Oleg, get in bathroom, stay there and shut up! \nEmil turns off the TV.  Our POV backs into the bathroom, closing the door but leaving it open a crack.  Emil looks down at his shoe.  The POV PANS down to the kitchen knife sticking out of Emil's BOOT.  Emil's hands pull his pants cuff over it.  POV PANS up to Emil as he moves to the door and opens it.  It's not Daphne and she's not world class. \nHONEY Hi, I'm Honey. \nEMIL Where's Czech girl? \nHONEY Baby, I'm anybody you want me to be. I'm a little schoolgirl, I'm mommy, I'm a Czech girl. \nShe enters.  Closes the door behind her. \nHONEY (CONT'D) Now I like to get business out of the way before we get down to pleasure.  Why don'tchya put my money on the dresser. \nEMIL I ordered a Czech girl.  Daphne, you know her? \nGil looks confused.  Eddie points to the toilet.  Seat is up. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Do the seat for me. \nGil crosses to the toilet and starts to dust it.  Eddie stands in the bathroom - studying the scene.  Holding the unlit cigar.  Looking around at the blood splattered walls. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Only one guys checked in? \nLEON Yeah. \nEDDIE C'mere.  You wanna go to homicide school?  Here - make yourself useful. \nEddie positions Jordy behind the tub next to the wall. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Our killer...our killer's standing here slashing at her.  She's fightin' him. The blood is splattering this way.  It's on this wall... (pointing to the right of Jordy) And there's some specks over here. (to the left of Jordy) There's nothing here because someone was standing right here.  Someone big.  And he's got blood on him.  Lots of blood. He wouldn't walk out of here like that. (turning to Murphy) Murphy, what kind of knife you think we're talking about here? \nMurphy pulls out a clear plastic ruler and walks over to the blood-splattered wall. \nMURPHY If you look here where he missed and hit the wall you see that the marks aren't deep but they're kinda wide... not your everyday kitchen or pocket knife. \nEDDIE What if the tip was broken off? \nMURPHY Could be.  Then we should find it here somewhere. \nEDDIE I think we've already found it. \nEddie exchanges a look with Jordy as Tommy, the young detective, returns. \nTOMMY There was only one call from this room last night.  I dialed it.  It's an escort service. \nLEON Did you identify yourself? \nTOMMY Hey, I'm new but I'm not stupid. \nEDDIE Call communications and get an address on that number. \nTommy holds up a slip of paper with the outcall service address on it. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Good work. \nINT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - STAIRS - DAY \nJordy hurries out - catches up with Eddie. \nJORDY You goin' to the escort service? \nEDDIE You got any better ideas? \nJORDY Mind if I ride along with you? \nEDDIE This has nothing to do with your fire. \nJORDY But what if it does?  You might need my help. \nAs Eddie exits the hotel, a MAN approaches. \nMAN Hey, Eddie, can I get your autograph for my son? \nEXT. KING EDWARD HOTEL - DAY \nJordy catches up.  Eddie finishes signing the autograph using the man's back. \nEDDIE I'll let you know what happens. \nJORDY This is ridiculous.  I'm not gonna be in your way - we can talk the case over. \nEDDIE Tell you what - I'll flip you a coin. If you win you can come with me.  If you don't win, you don't come. \nJORDY I'll call it... tails. \nEddie pulls out a coin and hands it to Jordy. \nEDDIE Okay.  I'll call it.  Heads. \nJordy flips the coin and it's heads. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Heads.  See, you lost twice. (beat) Okay.  Get in. \nJordy goes for the passenger side of the car.  Before Jordy can get in, Eddie starts to pull away.  Jordy stands on the sidewalk - dejected.  Eddie stops the car again and this time lets Jordy get in. \nEDDIE He had a videocamera?  Where is she? Quickly! \nROSE She washes hair up at Ludwig's - a salon on 63rd and Madison. \nEXT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY \nAs Eddie speeds through the street, SIREN BLARING. \nINT. EDDIE'S CAR - DAY \nJordy holds on as Eddie darts in and out of cars with astonishing dexterity.  This man can drive.  Eddie picks up his phone - dials.  Jordy is on his cell phone as well. \nEDDIE Leon - meet us at 63rd and Madison. Hair salon.  Ludwig's. \nJORDY (overlapping) I'm on my way with Eddie.  Ludwig's. 63rd and Madison.  The suspects might be there already. \nEddie looks over as Jordy disconnects.  Eddie picks up a beer he was holding between his legs - finishes it. \nEDDIE You thirsty? \nJORDY I'm on duty. \nEDDIE (drinking) So am I.  Alright, I'll go inside and you cover the back. \nJORDY Of course. \nEDDIE Hey!  I always wanted to be a cop when I was a kid.  I dreamed of running up to a door, kicking it in, pulling my gun and yelling 'Freeze!' at the bad guy! What'd you dream about? \nJORDY I wanted to run up to a building on fire, kick in the door, rush into the smoke and save a kid. \nEDDIE Then I guess we're doin' this the right way, aren't we?  If we pull up to a burning building I'll gladly let you go first. \nJordy looks at Eddie - can't deny he's right. \nINT. LUDWIG'S SALON - DAY \nWe're in a moving video POV of Ludwig's, the hair salon - it's big and spacious.  The lens finds THE RECEPTIONIST. \nOLEG (O.S.) Daphne Handlova? \nRECEPTIONIST Daphne?  In the back.  Probably shampooing a customer's hair. \nOleg approaches Daphne who is mixing hair dye.  LUDWIG, the owner, is with her. \nLUDWIG Why are you messing with your hair color again?  You're going to kill your hair. You won't look good with black hair. \nDAPHNE I want to do it, alright? \nLUDWIG Well, then do it after work.  A customer's waiting. \nHe leaves, a customer approaches.  She smiles at him - turns on the water in the sink then sees - Oleg filming her.  She backs up...suddenly moves to the emergency door! \nTO THE BACKYARD \nThere's a garden out there.  Daphne runs toward the alley. Oleg follows her - still videotaping.  As she rounds the corner she bumps into...Emil!  He pulls out his kitchen knife, shoving her against the wall, pushing the blade with the broken tip against her throat. \nEMIL I...I have a temper. \nShe looks at him, not understanding.  Oleg films the scene. \nEMIL (CONT'D) When I lose it, I lose control.  I didn't intend to kill Milos but he stole from me.  Cheated me!  When I went to prison, they beat me.  I still didn't tell he was my partner.  I loved Milos like a brother... \nThe tone in Emil's voice - there's an uncharacteristic softness to it.  He wants to reconcile his behavior to her. \nEMIL (CONT'D) (in English) I'm not a killer. \nThe back door opens.  He shoves the knife in his pocket as Ludwig peers around the alleyway.  What he sees is Emil leaning close to Daphne, kissing her. \nLUDWIG Daphne, will you be coming back to work? \nDAPHNE In a minute, Ludwig. \nLudwig leaves. \nEMIL Smart girl.  I'm glad you're not a whore.  But washing hair?  This is no job for a woman as beautiful as you. They should be washing your hair. \nEmil reaches into his pocket and pulls out SOMETHING, sticks it in the palm of her hand, closing her fingers around it. \nEMIL (CONT'D) I don't want to kill you.  But if you talk, I will. (whispers) I thought you'd want these. \nDaphne can be seen waiting in the back of the restaurant, maybe twenty feet away.  Tommy stands next to her.  This is where Eddie and Jordy are headed. \nNICOLETTE I understand, but I noticed that the Fire Marshall is here with you.  Is this somehow related to the fire department? \nEDDIE I really can't give out any information right now at this point. \nNICOLETTE Okay.  But I do understand that your partner, Leon Jackson's been injured. Is that correct? \nEDDIE He was hurt, but not seriously.  He'll be fine. \nNICOLETTE Do you have the suspect in custody? \nEDDIE Um...now is not a good time, okay. Detective Jackson's hurt.  He's fine. I've got a Fire Marshall shot, Detective Jackson is hurt but not seriously. \nNICOLETTE (to cameraman) Alright, cut, cut, cut. \nMike the cameraman cuts the cameraman - lowers it from his shoulder. \nNICOLETTE (CONT'D) (to Eddie) Eddie, are you okay? \nEDDIE Yeah.  Now's not a good time. \nNICOLETTE Alright. \nEDDIE Alright? \nNICOLETTE Alright. \nEDDIE Alright. \nNICOLETTE Okay. \nEddie walks into the restaurant.  Throws a look back at her, then enters. \nINT. ARMAND RESTAURANT - DAY \nJordy talks to Daphne. \nDAPHNE I told your partner, I can't help.  I didn't see anything. \nEDDIE C'mon, start at the beginning.  You know these people? \nDAPHNE Tamina was a friend of mine.  My shower was broken, she let me use theirs. \nEDDIE Go on. \nShe says nothing. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Whether you tell us or not, we'll find out.  Better if it comes from you. \nDAPHNE If I tell you, will you arrest me? \nEDDIE Arrest you for what?  Why would we arrest you? \nShe still hesitates. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) What are you hiding?  Why are you afraid \nJORDY She just saw two of her friends killed! They probably threatened her. \nEDDIE Is that all there is? \nShe looks at Eddie. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Are you here illegally?  Don't worry about that.  We'll talk to Immigration. They won't deport you. \nDAPHNE No, no, don't talk to Immigration! \nShe clams up. \nJORDY Why not? \nEDDIE Something back home? \nJordy leads Daphne to a table - she sits.  Eddie sits across from her.  Jordy crouches down next to her. \nDAPHNE ...my little sister and I shared a flat - I came home one night and a man was raping her.  His gun was on the chair... He came at me and I shot him. \nJORDY (optimistic) Alright.  That's a justifiable homicide. \nDAPHNE I will if they don't send me back. \nJORDY They won't until this is over. \nShe looks away.  Out the window.  Jordy sees emotion filling her eyes.  She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up. \nDAPHNE Are you married? \nJORDY Divorced. \nDAPHNE Do you live alone? (beat) I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody? \nJordy looks at her.  Can't quite tell if she's trying to manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before all the shit starts. \nJORDY I can't take you to my place. \nDAPHNE Somewhere else? \nJordy looks at her... \nEDDIE \nStaring right at us. \nEDDIE I want to talk to you about something serious. \nHe holds up the diamond engagement ring. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I want to live the rest of my life with you...I don't know you've been married before and I've never been married, but I do love you, and... \nEddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the proposal.  He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff. Leon's blood.  Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka tonic. \nPAULIE She's here. \nPaulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual. He hands Eddie the towel.  Eddie wipes off his face and hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie.  Paulie helps Eddie on with his coat.  Eddie takes some Visine out of his coat pocket.  Drops a few in each eye.  HE straightens himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the drink.  Eddie sets the glass down and starts out.  Paulie hands him a Binaca.  Eddie gives himself a squirt as he exits.  Paulie follows. \nINT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nIt's lunchtime...it's crowded.  Eddie takes a seat at a table.  He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under the table.  Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind. Gives him a kiss on the cheek. \nNICOLETTE Hey, honey. \nEDDIE Hey. \nShe orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits down across the table.  There's a long pause - they just look at each other. \nNICOLETTE What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement. \nEDDIE I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you! \nNICOLETTE You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something. \nEDDIE Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh... \nNICOLETTE Stop it. \nEDDIE Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out? \nNICOLETTE Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me. \nEDDIE I'm not. \nNICOLETTE Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something. \nEDDIE Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was... \nNICOLETTE That was good.  You were holding the evidence. \nEDDIE You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not. \nNICOLETTE Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh? \nEDDIE You're ruthless. \nNICOLETTE You're not so bad yourself. \nThey look at each other. \nNICOLETTE (CONT'D) C'mere. \nEddie manages to get up from the sofa and position the chair in such a way that he can fall over backward and grab the gun.  Emil limps toward the gun at the same time and it is not clear in the darkness who has the gun. \nOleg gets up from the sofa and goes over to get the videocamera.  Eddie has managed to get the gun and comes up as Oleg is moving in with the camera and starts shooting toward Oleg - managing to shoot one of the blinds off the window and one of the lampshades off the lamp. \nOleg crouches down with the camera and Eddie starts to turn toward Emil who comes at him with the knife and stabs him in the stomach. \nEmil steps back, revealing the knife is BURIED IN EDDIE'S STOMACH. \nEddie stumbles backward, falling over but still attached to the chair - holding the gun.  Eddie can't believe he got stabbed.  Blood swells around his stomach.  He can't be dying.  This can't be happening.  He looks at Emil.  The pain is terrible.  Oleg has knelt down next to Eddie - getting a close up. \nEmil looks at Eddie. \nEMIL (CONT'D) Die.  Die. \nEmil looks around.  Grabs a black pillow and finishes Eddie off, suffocating him. \nBLACKNESS \nWe are moving through a tunnel - pitch black, so dark all you feel is the motion.  We are travelling very fast.  Finally, in the distance, a speck of light which fills the frame. We slowly pull back from the white light to discover it is a tiny pixel on a TV screen. \nWIDENING \nfurther out we see Eddie's funeral on the evening news.  It's an enormous gathering - a sea of blue uniforms and dignitaries.  In the upper right hand corner, superimposed over the funeral, is a picture of Eddie from his ID and in his NYPD uniform.  We see Oleg's reflection on the set with the videocamera.  He is filming the TV.  We hear the audio from Eddie's funeral. \nNEWSCASTER (ON T.V.) ..Detective Flemming was one of the most decorated NYPD detectives in the history of New York.  He made several thousand arrests during his career, including the famed Stephen Geller case.  Beloved by the community in which he served.  His partner eulogized him... \nLeon is at the mic. \nLEON (ON T.V.) ...Eddie was my mentor, my best friend and my partner...he taught me the meaning of the word 'cop.'  He was a man in every sense of the word.  I'll miss him... (choking on tears) Sleep well, brother. \nLeon begins to sing \"Amazing Grace.\"  Oleg PANS from the TV and focuses it on a lightbulb.  Hands enter the frame - carefully pouring clear liquid into an ashtray.  A long hypodermic needle slides into the ashtray - the plunger is pulled back and the needle quickly fills with liquid. Gingerly, the needle is inserted into the lightbulb.  Again, the plunger moves and the lightbulb is filled and placed on a table...next to a CAN OF GASOLINE.  VIDEOCAMERA ZOOMS OUT revealing...Emil sitting at a hotel desk doing this. \nINT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nIt's packed with COPS drinking.  Prosecutors...lawyers...many who were at the funeral, including Leon.  All wear the black ribbon on their badges.  There's a quality of an Irish wake - boisterous, guys cursing...many cops in uniform.  A buffet has been laid out. \nHawkins enters in a black suit, wearing a black ribbon.  He greets people, shaking hands, embracing Leon. \nHAWKINS Awful...what an awful day.  He was New York City. \nHawkins notices a young man by the window.  Teary-eyed.  It's Tommy.  Hawkins nods to him. \nTOMMY I never got to tell him how much I admired him. \nHAWKINS I know, son, I know.  We all loved him. \nHawkins moves on...greeting others.  He notices at the end of the bar - sitting alone on a stool - is Nicolette.  He moves to her.  Pulls up a stool alongside her.  She turns, looks at him.  Just stares at him for a long beat.  She is bombed. Definitely drunk.  She's had many.  She turns to Hawkins. \nNICOLETTE You know...you know he was gonna propose to me.  The crime guys found a card he'd written out to me.  And a ring box...these fuckers that killed him - have my ring.  They have my diamond engagement ring... \nHawkins touches her shoulder with compassion. \nHAWKINS I know. \nNICOLETTE What do you mean you know?  He told you he was gonna propose to me? \nHAWKINS Well, he... \nNICOLETTE (overriding) I want to hear everything he said. \nHAWKINS I'm trying to tell you. \nNICOLETTE Alright.  Go ahead. \nHAWKINS That morning.  He was talking to me and Leon about marriage. \nNICOLETTE Oh my G-d.  We were having lunch here. He started making overtures - talking about little shoes next to his in his closet but I got a call to anchor - and I walked out on him.  I walked out on him when he was trying to ask me to marry him!! \nNicolette is crying now.  She angrily wipes away a tear. \nNICOLETTE (CONT'D) I'd never had a great relationship before.  I'd never made great choices with men.  And he wasn't easy to get to know.  He was older, my parents told me I was nuts to get involved with him. But he was so great to me.  Always encouraging, telling me I could do anything... (beat) He was the one.  You know, I'd give up everything - everything - for just a little more time.  I would've spent fifteen minutes with him if that's all I knew I had. \nShe's lost it.  Hawkins consoles her.  Nicolette shrugs him off - turns back to her drink.  Downs the rest of it.  A woman arrives, MAGGIE, Hawkins' producer - assistant in tow. \nMAGGIE Robert...? \nHAWKINS What are you doing here? \nMAGGIE (holding a cellular) You've got a call. \nHe looks at her.  Nods.  They walk up to the stairs as the front door opens.  A NEIGHBOR exits, shocked.  Jordy pulls Daphne out of the way. \nDAPHNE (CONT'D) (in Czech to the man) Hello.  How are you? \nINT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT BUILDING - HALLWAY - CONTINUOUS \nJordy and Daphne make their way up the stairs.  A bouquet of flowers are outside Daphne's apartment. \nJORDY What's this? \nShe takes the card.  Jordy looks over her shoulder.  Daphne reads: \"Good luck with all your troubles.  I'm here if you need me...Ludwig.\" \nJORDY (CONT'D) Is he your boyfriend? \nDAPHNE Ludwig?  He's gay - are you jealous? \nJORDY If I was your boyfriend, I might be. \nDAPHNE If you were my boyfriend, I'd suggest you find another girlfriend that isn't going to jail ten-thousand miles away. \nThey're staring in each other's eyes.  The sexual tension strong. \nJORDY A good Immigration lawyer could stall the process.  Eddie recommended one. \nDAPHNE No matter what happens...I'm glad I met you. \nJORDY I'm glad I met you. \nThey hold each other's eyes...then suddenly they kiss. Urgently.  Passionately.  Somebody is coming up the stairs. They part quickly.  A tenant enters his apartment down the hall.  Jordy clears his throat. \nJORDY (CONT'D) Let's get your stuff. \nHe opens the door.  Peers inside - checking it out.  Turns to her.  Gestures that it's okay to enter. \nINT. DAPHNE'S APARTMENT - CONTINUOUS \nIt's very small.  Almost no furniture.  The bare minimum. The apartment is a hole.  She looks at Jordy.  Both thinking the same thought.  Another kiss. \nJORDY You better get packed. \nDAPHNE Right. \nShe holds his look. \nJORDY Do you have coffee? \nDAPHNE In the kitchen. \nJORDY I'll make some for us. \nDAPHNE I'll get my clothes. \nShe heads down the hall.  Jordy enters the small kitchen.  He flips on the kitchen light and the LIGHTBULB EXPLODES - SETTING THE CEILING ON FIRE AND RELEASING A RAIN OF FIRE INTO THE ROOM.  Jordy JUMPS BACK. \nDAPHNE (CONT'D) Jordy!!! \nJORDY No!  Get back!  GET BACK!!! \nJordy's more surprised than shaken.  It's a fire - he knows the drill.  He pushes her into the living room.  Then notices a FIRE EXTINGUISHER hanging on the wall.  Grabs it.  Aims it at the FIRE spreading in the kitchen.  He SPRAYS as Daphne SCREAMS! \nDAPHNE That's not mine! \nWHOOOOOOOOOSH!  The fire extinguisher FEEDS THE FIRE!  Flames leap up from the fire - shooting toward the extinguisher because it's filled with gasoline.  The handle LOCKS!  Jordy CAN'T TURN IT OFF.  Flames engulf the extinguisher and JORDY'S HAND. \nHe flings the extinguisher - BACKS OUT OF THE KITCHEN. Closes the door.  Jordy takes off his jacket.  Stuffs it under the bottom of the door.  Blocking the smoke.  He hurries into the living room.  Knowing it's moments before the extinguisher will explode.  Jordy pulls out his cellular. Hits the speed dial as he notices Daphne about to throw a chair through the window. \nJORDY Don't!  It'll suck the flames toward us! \nToo late.  She SMASHES the window.  There's an EXPLOSION in the kitchen.  Smoke and fire rush down the hallway and along the ceiling.  Jordy yells into the phone: \nJORDY (CONT'D) This is Jordan Warsaw!  We got a 1075, make it quick, we're trapped!  8th Avenue and 44th Street. \nHe pulls Daphne toward the bedroom.  It's locked.  Jordy kicks it open.  Grabs the comforter off the bed.  Shoves that under the door jam.  He pulls Daphne into the bathroom. Shuts the door.  Runs his severely burned hand under the cold water.  Daphne looks out the window - hearing the sirens. She notices someone has nailed the window shut.  And on top of one nail...is Eddie's gold shield. \nDAPHNE Oh my G-d!  Oh my G-d! \nJordy turns - sees Eddie's shield. \nDAPHNE (CONT'D) They were here! \nJORDY They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment! \nKorfin scans the crowd.  Looking for Emil and Oleg.  In the b.g., Duffy is SCREAMING. \nDUFFY What the hell are you talking about??? They're gonna do what? \nJordy and Korfin turn.  The Chief has a phone to his ear and is freaked. \nINT. LOBBY OF CHANNEL 12 BROADCASTING - NIGHT \nJORDY'S POV \nas he enters the TV station.  His clothes burnt and still wet.  The lobby's full of ANGRY COPS.  Tommy and Leon, still in his funeral suit, SCREAMING above them all at Maggie the producer and her ASSISTANT, who are standing behind the desk. \nTOMMY Where is he?!  Where is Hawkins?! \nMAGGIE He's not on the premises! \nLEON I want the tape.  Go get it and bring it here this minute. \nMAGGIE Any request for the video must be directed to \"Top Story's\" attorney - Bruce Cutler.  I'll be happy to give you his number. \nLeon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands.  Tommy pushes past the security guard to follow Leon.  They continue toward Maggie, pushing her further back into the office.  She tries to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open. \nLEON Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV, I'll get a warrant for your arrest and shove it so far up your ass it'll come outta your mouth! \nMAGGIE I want your shield number! \nHAWKINS (O.S.) Viewer discretion advised! \nMAGGIE (pointing at the TV) You want the tape?  There it is! \nLeon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a TV set which is mounted in the lobby.  The \"Top Story\" logo flashes on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk. \nHAWKINS What we are about to broadcast is very graphic footage... \nEveryone is riveted.  But Jordy notices outside...a \"Top Story\" NEWS VAN is waiting in the alley.  Robert Hawkins jumps from a doorway and into the van.  Jordy backs out. \nINT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - NIGHT \nPOP...a video POV of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is popped.  The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the table.  He nods at the waiter who leaves.  Emil raises the glass - looking into the lens. \nEMIL America!  Who says you can't be success in America?  I arrived with nothing, knowing nobody - now look - I am a success story! \nThe videocamera is lowered.  Oleg turns it off.  Asks suspiciously. \nOLEG You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we? \nEMIL Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are! \nEmil gestures toward the big television set.  We are in Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling.  Robert Hawkins is introducing his show. \nHAWKINS (ON T.V.) Good evening.  Welcome to \"Top Story\". Tonight, I present to you material of a graphic and violent nature never before seen on television.  And I do so with a heavy heart.  You will be first-hand witness to the slaying of celebrated New York City Homicide Detective, Eddie Flemming.  It would be only normal to ask, why?  Why are we showing something so journalist, I must show it.  A democracy survives through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening then we don't deserve our democracy, or our freedom.  Eddie Flemming was my friend.  I cried when I watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward.  Hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you. One final word, this material is absolutely not appropriate for children. \nThe restaurant BUZZES.  Emil checks his watch. \nOLEG In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me? \nEMIL The one who got caught in the bathroom. (beat) George Michael. \nEmil laughs.  Oleg doesn't. \nOLEG I'm serious. \nEMIL Shut up.  Look! \nEmil points towards the TV.  \"Top Story\" is continuing.  The scene cuts to Emil's video footage.  Eddie is handcuffed to the chair.  The light illuminating his face. \nOLEG (O.S.) This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.' (beat) And 'action!' \nEMIL Bad last moment - I cut it out. \nEmil looks at Oleg - furious. \nEMIL (CONT'D) I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape! \nOLEG Be quiet.  Watch. \nOleg watches the big-screen TV as Emil raises the pistol to Eddie's temple.  Eddie pushes him over the desk.  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto the floor.  Eddie continues around with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall.  Eddie and Emil both go for the gun.  Eddie knocks him out of the way.  Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. Leaves him in a ball on the floor.  Oleg comes at Eddie and he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa.  The blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more light.  Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach.  Oleg kneels down for a CLOSE-UP. \nJordy realizes how media savvy Emil is and understands in that moment why he's surrendering.  Jordy yanks Emil up - dragging him across the restaurant floor - Emil still favoring his ankle. \nCUTLER (to Emil) Don't say anything. \nEMIL Where are we going? \nCUTLER I'm coming with you. \nEMIL Yes.  Yes, come with me! \nCUTLER (to Jordy) I'm invoking rights - this man is represented by counsel.  I'm coming with him. \nThe \"Top Story\" crew is all over them, filming everything. Cutler stays close to Emil.  Making sure he's in the video footage. \nJORDY Turn that camera off! \nEXT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS \nAs Jordy comes out with a limping Emil, police are arriving. Tommy, Leon and Murphy run over as Jordy opens the back door to his car.  Leon grabs Emil. \nLEON I'll take him. \nJORDY No way!  He's mine! \nLEON (holding on to Emil, squeezing his arm hard) We're takin' him.  Don't argue! \nJORDY He's my collar! \nLEON Well, he killed my partner! \nJORDY He's yours but I take him in!  I'll drive him to the precinct, you can have him but I'm walkin' him in. \nLeon realizes Jordy wants to be seen on TV taking Emil into custody. \nLEON Okay, kid, have your 15-minutes.  I'll follow you.  Tommy, you ride with him! \nLeon stares hatefully into Emil's eyes. \nLEON (CONT'D) You're goin' down, motherfucker, you are goin' down.  I'll be there with a smile when they put you down! \nCutler hurries to Emil's side. \nCUTLER Don't say a word.  Don't respond to his taunting! (to Leon) He's represented by counsel.  You want to speak to someone - you speak to me! \nTOMMY Out of the way, counselor. \nTommy shoves Cutler aside. \nCUTLER Don't you put your hands on me, Detective. \nJordy pushes Emil in the back seat and slams the door.  Leon turns to Hawkins, whose cameras are filming everything. \nLEON And you, you'll pay for what you did! \nHAWKINS (low) This footage will work in your favor. When the jury sees this - no matter what Cutler tries, they'll convict him. \nLeon looks at him. This man used to be his friend. \nLEON You outta be ashamed.  Ashamed of yourself. \nHAWKINS If I didn't put it on somebody else would!  I was his friend! \nLEON Don't give me that fucking shit. \nThe cameras are rolling. \nMURPHY Don't get into it on TV. \nLEON (yells to other cop cars) Alright, let's get going! \nLeon and the other cops rush to their cars.  Jordy is already behind the wheel.  As soon as Tommy jumps in the passenger seat, Jordy takes off.  The cameras film him driving away. INT. JORDY'S CAR - NIGHT \nJordy takes a left turn, racing away.  Running all the lights. \nTOMMY What are you doin'?  You're gonna lose everybody! \nJordy rips through another turn, heading toward the West Side Highway.  The car speeds up the ramp and races up the left lane - having lost the police. \nTOMMY (CONT'D) Where are you goin'??  This ain't the way to the station! \nA HOOKER, wrapped in a towel, opens the door a crack, looking out at the waiter. \nHOOKER Come in. \nJordy whips around the corner - pointing his gun and pushing the hooker back out of the room.  Jordy moves to the bedroom door.  Peers through the crack.  Oleg sits on the edge of the bed in his skivvies with two naked prostitutes.  He's hooked up his videocamera to the TV set and is showing them his footage of the fire. \nOLEG Look at that.  See that shot!  Seamless. No cuts. (excited) And look.  Look at that transition. That's filmmaking!!  Isn't it great?! \nJordy KICKS in the door - gun raised. \nJORDY Don't move! \nOleg grabs the videocamera.  Has on hooker in a head lock and picks up the other one.  He rushes at Jordy - using one of the hookers for protection. \nJORDY (CONT'D) Drop the girl!  Drop her!! \nOleg pushes the hookers at Jordy - knocking Jordy back into the living room and over the back of the sofa.  Oleg rushes out into the \nHOTEL HALLWAY \nOleg runs to the fire exit - Jordy follows, chasing Oleg down the stairwell. \nEXT. BROADWAY - NIGHT \nOleg bursts out a door which opens onto Broadway.  He runs through the crowd - knocking pedestrians aside!  Jordy chases him, gun in hand! \nOleg runs into the street, darting in and out of traffic, cars braking to a stop.  One SLAMS into another. Jordy leaps over a car, closing in on Oleg.  People gawk. Even in New York, it's odd to see a man being chased in his underwear.  Oleg runs, knocking people aside.  He's holding the camera in his hand.  It's on. \nJORDY STOP!  STOP THAT MAN! \nA UNIFORMED COP turns as Oleg runs right into him.  Knocking him down.  Oleg beats him, takes his gun and runs into: \nINT. MOVIE THEATER LOBBY - CONTINUOUS \nOleg, gun in hand, runs past the TICKET TAKER at the door. \nTICKET TAKER Hey, come back here! \nThe ticket taker runs after Oleg who continues past the candy counter.  Jordy rushes in the door. \nJORDY Where is he?  Where'd he go? \nTICKET TAKER Middle door. \nJordy continues running through the lobby - past the middle door - and enters the theater through the far door. \nINT. MOVIE THEATER - NIGHT \nJordy enters the theater, crouches down in the aisle.  It's a night scene, the theater is dark.  Jordy tries to see faces. He cuts through a row of seats to the middle aisle. \nDRUNK'S VOICE Kill him!  Kill the bastard! \nJordy spins toward the voice - it's a DRUNK.  Others start YELLING for blood! \nAUDIENCE Shoot him!  SHOOT! \nA GUNSHOT!  Jordy ducks!  Another GUNSHOT!  Jordy realizes the shots are coming from the screen. \nOLEG Look!  Over here! \nJordy turns.  Oleg stands up and FIRES at him - trying to film Jordy's death with a videocamera. Jordy ducks, then rises up with his gun as Oleg vaults over the seats, leaping from one to the other, mashing shoulders and heads, bounding for the screen. \nJORDY Everybody down!  Stay DOWN! \nJordy FIRES as the screen villain blasts away.  Some in the audience don't realize the real thing is happening.  Oleg leaps on the stage in front of the screen, illuminated by it. Jordy runs down the aisle.  Oleg FIRES at Jordy.  Jordy FIRES back.  People panic - scurrying away - Jordy can't get a clear shot.  Oleg FIRES again, wounding a moviegoer.  Jordy raises up as the theater lights go on...and Oleg is gone! Jordy jumps on the stage - runs backstage - Oleg has disappeared. \nJORDY (CONT'D) Shit! \nSIRENS are heard from outside.  VOICES of cops are heard as they enter. \nCLOSE ON TV \nA REPORTER is in Times Square, reports from outside the movie theater. \nREPORTER (ON T.V.) ...and the wild chase through Times Square ended with the suspect, Oleg Razgul, escaping.  The fire department has identified the fire marshal involved in the failed pursuit as Jordy Warsaw. \nThe channel is changed.  PETER ARNETT is reporting the same story. \nPETER ARNETT (ON T.V.) In a related matter, Mr. Slovak's attorney, Bruce Cutler - famous for handling sensational cases - claims his client is unfit to stand trial. \nEMIL Yeah, he hated me from day when I was born.  Put it out.  Can you put the cigarette out? \nCutler takes the cigarette from Emil's lips and extinguishes it. \nEMIL (CONT'D) That's what he did to me.  He put cigarettes out on me. \nCUTLER Your father put cigarettes out on you? \nEMIL Out on my back when I was a small boy. \nCUTLER Can I see your back? \nEmil rises.  Cutler comes around and pulls his shirt up.  HIS ENTIRE BACK IS COVERED WITH DISGUSTING PURPLISH WELTS FROM CIGARETTE BURNS.  Cutler recoils - horrified. \nCUTLER (CONT'D) Oh, Jesus. \nEMIL I'm abused.  Don't you think? \nCUTLER I don't think it's abuse, I think it's torture. \nINT. FIRE STATION 91 - DUFFY'S OFFICE - DAY \nInside the Arson Squad, Duffy sits behind his desk.  Jordy stands across the table from his Chief.  Behind Jordy we can see Garcia and Korfin outside, listening.  Duffy has a subpoena in his hand. \nDUFFY The public doesn't have any idea what we do and now you're going to define our image!  This is going to be our Rodney King! \nJORDY What was I supposed to do?  The guy tried to mug me.  I was gonna send a cop back - I just forgot. \nDUFFY Forgot?  You handcuffed a civilian to a tree?! \nJORDY Chief - I know I screwed up - but this guy was no innocent civilian. \nDUFFY Well this is gonna end your career and probably mine. \nJORDY End my career? \nDUFFY How are you going to fight this?  Maybe if Oleg hadn't gotten away and you'd been on the front page, as a hero, this thing would be easier to fight.  You'd have the good to weight against the bad! It's unfortunate that I have to make decisions based upon your press coverage but there's nothing I can do!  Gimme your shield. \nJORDY But Chief?  Over this?? \nDUFFY There's nothing to talk about.  Get a good lawyer.  You're suspended until your trial. \nJordy sighs.  Dying inside.  He surrenders his shield.  Drops his handcuffs, his pager and his gun.  Duffy picks up the gun - looks at it. \nDUFFY (CONT'D) (pats Jordy's shoulder) I know you got backup at home.  Drop it off. \nJordy sighs and exits. \nINT. IMMIGRATION & NATURALIZATION OFFICE - DAY \nJordy is talking to BILL STERN, a senior special agent.  In another office we see Daphne with two 25-year old ASSISTANT U.S. ATTORNEYS. \nSTERN (to Jordy) Look, what don't you understand?  We've got a good relationship with the Czech's and the State Department doesn't want to cause an incident. \nJORDY But the D.A. needs her as an eyewitness! \nSTERN They've got her testimony on videotape. And even if they do take her to court immediately after she'll be extradited. The Czechs want her back.  She shot a cop!  I mean, Christ, man, what if Emil Slovak and Oleg Razgul fled to the Czech Republic?  How would you feel if the Czechs wouldn't give them back to us?! \nStern looks over at Daphne sitting in another office.  Lowers his voice. \nSTERN (CONT'D) And just between us...I was married to a redhead.  They're a jinx.  Redheads are like cross-eyed priests.  Stay away from both. \nJordy gives him a look. \nSTERN (CONT'D) You want to see her - go ahead. \nJordy enters the other office.  Sits next to Daphne.  The assistant U.S. Attorneys leave. \nJORDY We're gonna fight the extradition. \nDaphne takes Jordy's bandaged hand in hers. \nDAPHNE Forget about me.  You have enough problems of your own. \nJORDY ...Do you really want me to forget about you? \nDAPHNE I don't want to drag you down with me. \nJORDY Daphne, I... \nTHE POLICE VAN PULLS UP \nCutler's car behind it.  Emil - handcuffed - is unloaded from the van.  Reporters swarm forward - Cutler gets out of his car, hurrying up, taking his place alongside Emil and the POLICE ESCORTS.  The swarm follows - firing questions at Cutler.  He answers the barrage of questions with: \nCUTLER ...my client was suffering from a major illness of schizophrenic nature wherein during times of intense stress, as a result of paranoid and psychotic delusions - there was impairment of his ability to appreciate wrongfullness... This is a victory for the mentally ill! \nJordy walks alongside the moving mass.  His eyes focused on Emil - his hand in his pocket.  We notice in the crowd Max, the celebrity-crazed pyromaniac.  What's he doing here? Max's hand is also stuck deeply in his pocket.  A weird gleam in his eye.  We see Korfin in the group, speaking to other cops.  Nicolette and her camera crew are vying for their place in the mass.  She watches Emil with quiet rage.  Cutler continues: \nCUTLER (CONT'D) ...before Emil boards the police boat and heads for Rykers Island where he will be checked into the psyche ward, I want to say one last word to you all... As you know, Emil was coerced by Oleg Razgul into committing these murders, yet Oleg is still out in the street, a free man, filming gruesome murders... My client and I hope he is brought to justice in the near future. \nThey are through the monuments, approaching the steps when Jordy passes a distracted Hawkins - who's checking his watch obsessively. \nHAWKINS Where the hell is he?  Goddamn it?! \nJordy glares at Emil.  Emil looks back at Jordy, gloating. Smiles.  He won.  He beat the system.  Jordy suddenly erupts. \nJORDY You think this is funny??  What the hell are you laughing at? \nEmil stares down Jordy.  Jordy grips the gun inside the jacket. \nCUTLER (to a nearby escort) Officer, keep this man back, he's assaulted my client on previous occasions. \nA PATROLMAN blocks Jordy from Emil. \nJORDY This is it?  This bastard kills the best cop this city ever had and we do nothing? \nCUTLER You may not like it marshal, but that's the law. \nJORDY And what about the other victims??  What about their families?  He'll end up in some country club nuthouse while his lawyer sells his rights to the movies and we just stand here and do nothing? We let this scumbag walk? \nJordy moves past the officer.  Emil breaks away from Cutler. Gets in Jordy's face.  Laughs quietly. \nEMIL Be careful.  I can kill you.  I'm insane. \nJordy shoves Emil into Cutler.  A scuffle breaks out as the cops separate the two - pulling Jordy back as we cut to: \nA VIDEO POV \nas it approaches Hawkins from behind.  A hand dips into frame tapping Hawkins on the shoulder.  Hawkins turns - sees who he's been waiting for.  His face lights up. \nHAWKINS I thought you wouldn't show up.  Where is it?  Where is the tape? \nIT'S OLEG \nIn disguise - sunglasses and a hat.  Holding his videocamera. \nOLEG It's all in here.  All in here. \nMEANWHILE JORDY \nhas been separated from Cutler and Emil as Hawkins' voice cuts above the din of the crowd, announcing excitedly: \nHAWKINS Wait a minute, Bruce!  We've got some interesting evidence, something you should look at! \nReporters turn as Hawkins speaks.  His crew is taping as he continues introducing his broadcast: \nHAWKINS (CONT'D) I have exclusive rights to the ORIGINAL UNCUT videotape shot by Oleg Razgul, proving Emil Slovak was not insane! Hard to believe...watch! \nReporters swing their cameras over as Oleg holds his videocamera up in the air. \nOLEG (ON VIDEO) He knew exactly what he was doing - all of this was planned!  It's all here in my movie.  Emil is not insane.  Look. Look! \nOleg PLAYS his videocamera as lenses focus, we see excerpts of the moment where Emil explains to Eddie: \nEMIL (ON VIDEO) ...so we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital... \nCUTLER (points to Oleg) Officers, there's your killer, do your duty, arrest him! \nThe police are attempting to get to Oleg, but a sea of reporters separate them.  We hear the staccato calls from the press corps.  Nicolette looks on in amazed outrage.  Jordy notices and starts moving towards her.  Before the POLICE CAPTAIN in charge of the detail can react, the rage which killed Milos, Tamina and Honey wells up inside Emil.  He yells at Oleg! \nEMIL Traitor!! \nOLEG No.  You are the traitor.  You are murderer.  I am director.  Action! \nOleg pulls his gun.  Emil pulls Cutler in front of him as: \nBANG! \nOleg FIRES!  Cutler is SHOT and goes down.  Hawkins swings his camera over to Oleg - filming the would-be assassin. Oleg FIRES off another SHOT - hitting the COURT OFFICER escorting Emil.  Emil grabs the down officer's gun.  He swivels - rapid fires at Oleg.  Oleg topples.  People are screaming.  It's CHAOS. \n", "test1_input": "JORDY It's your crime scene now.  You can do what you want. \nEDDIE Watch the news? \nJORDY Nah, I musta missed it. \nEDDIE Well, just so you know.  I gave you guys the credit. \nJORDY Well, just so you know, I don't care about that stuff. \nEDDIE Nah, why should you? \nJORDY I don't even watch TV. \nEDDIE Good.  Good.  Commendable. \nEddie knocks his 'won ton soup' back. \nJORDY Did you get a report from the M.E.? \nEDDIE Sure.  But I would like to ask you something.  You got a problem with me? \nJORDY If you found me steppin' on your crime scene - it might piss you off, too. (then) What about the report? \nEDDIE You were right, they were both dead before the fire.  The male was stabbed so hard the killer broke off the tip of the knife in his spine.  That's usually an indicator of something personal. \nJordy pulls out a sketch of Daphne.  Hands it to Eddie. \nJORDY The Super said he'd seen her before but she didn't live here. \nEDDIE Pretty. \nJORDY (acts as if he didn't notice) Hmmmm. \nEDDIE Maybe you don't care about that either. (beat) Prettiest suspect I've had in awhile. \nJORDY Who says she's a suspect? \nJordy tries to take the sketch back.  Eddie holds on. \nEDDIE What would you call her? \nJORDY Look, I'm not even sure she has anything to do with this.  I saw her outside after the fire - thought it was a lead. Maybe she saw something.  Maybe she was visiting somebody here.  Who knows? \nEddie walks up to the burnt mattress - where the bodies were. \nEDDIE Obviously they weren't having sex.  As you pointed out.  So why go through all the trouble of putting 'em like that? \nEddie passes a crime scene photo of the bodies to Jordy. \nJORDY Maybe it's a ritual thing or someone trying to send a message.  Burial rites are taken very seriously in Eastern Europe.  It could be to humiliate them. Just burning them up, no proper funeral, it's like condemning them to hell. \nEDDIE Eastern Europe.  Like what?  Romania? Hungary? \nJORDY Or Czechoslovakia.  The Slavs have been fighting the Germans and the Russians for a thousand years.  These are very intense people and they take things personally. \nEddie's cellular rings - he grabs it. \nEDDIE Yeah?  Where?  You sure it was a knife? Uh-huh.  Really?  Okay. (to Jordy) We've got another murder - in a hotel on Eighth Avenue.  A stabbing.  Clerk said the room was rented by a Russian... \nEddie's moving with Daphne's sketch. \nJORDY I'll come with you. \nEDDIE There wasn't a fire.  There'll be nothing for you to do. \nJORDY I can watch you, Eddie.  Maybe I'll learn something. \nEDDIE This isn't homicide school. \nJORDY My parents are from Poland.  I can help with the Eastern European angle. \nEDDIE You're Polish? \nJORDY My folks are. \nEDDIE Stay here. \nEXT. TIMES SQUARE - NEWS STAND - DAY \n", "test1_true": "OLEG This is second day in America.  First day was very exciting.  Full of thrills and chills.  Over there, is co-star of my new movie, Emil! \nHe turns the camera around - FILMING EMIL. \nEMIL (to vendor) Who is he? \nVENDOR New York's finest.  This is his case. \nThe VENDOR - picks up People.  Stephen Geller is on the cover. \nVENDOR (CONT'D) This all you want? \nEMIL Do you know how much killer gets for movie rights? \nVENDOR (People) In here, says he wants a million. \nEMIL Million?!  The killer gets one million dollars for a television interview? \nVENDOR Hey, tabloids paid Ted Bundy - famous serial killer - half a million for his interview.  And how much you think Monica got for writing book about the President coming on to her?  It pays to be a killer or a whore in this country. Look, you want magazine or not? \nEMIL Yes.  Both. \nOLEG And these. \nOleg picks up FILM COMMENT, MOVIELINE and PREMIERE magazine. Emil pays for everything. \nEMIL (to Oleg) Get a taxi. \nOleg tucks the magazines in his coat, picks up the suitcases and hails a taxi.  As Emil collects his change he sees an old BLIND WOMAN waiting at the crosswalk.  The light's blinking WALK. \nEMIL (CONT'D) Let me help. \nEmil gently takes her arm and crosses her to the other side. \nBLIND WOMAN Thank you, son. \nEmil watches her walk on. \nINT. KING EDWARD HOTEL ROOM - DAY \nThe hotel room is a hive of activity.  GIL is dusting the dresser for prints.  Another officer is stripping the bed and putting the bedding into a big, clear plastic bag.  As Eddie enters the crime scene, a POLICE PHOTOGRAPHER is standing in the doorway taking pictures. \nEDDIE Where is she? \nLEON Takin' a bath. \nEDDIE Any I.D.? \nLEON Still unknown but we're running prints. Kid over there caught the case. \nJordy enters.  Leon steps in his way. \nLEON (CONT'D) Sorry...PD only. \nEDDIE It's okay. \nEddie walks over to a young detective.  TOMMY CULLEN, only 26, is excited to meet Eddie. \nTOMMY Tommy Cullen.  Heard a lot about you. Nice to meet you.  Here's what we got. A girl in there, figure her to be a prostitute, looks like she was fighting for her life.  She's got defense wounds on her hands.  Right this way - in the bathroom. \nEDDIE After you. \nEddie follows Tommy into the bathroom.  There's blood splattered all over the walls and the floor.  Honey's topless body lies in the tub tangled in the bloody shower curtain. MURPHY, an Irish medical examiner (M.E.), is examining the body. \nTOMMY Room was registered to a Francis Capra. \nJORDY Capra?  That's not Czech or Russian. Who said he sounded Russian? \nTOMMY The clerk? \nEDDIE Check the switchboard, see what phone calls were made from this room. \nTOMMY I'll do it. \nTommy heads out.  Eddie takes out his cigar holder.  Slides out what's left of his cigar.  Re-lights it.  Looks down at Honey's body in the bathtub.  Gil's dusting the tub for prints. \nMURPHY Clothes were off in the other room.  Tub is dry except for the blood. \nEDDIE Any of you guys take a piss lately? \n", "test1_id": 2244, "test2_input": "NICOLETTE Okay.  And you know what, I'll swing by my place, grab a couple pairs of shoes and maybe just test them out next to yours...How's that... Would that be a good thing. \nEDDIE Yeah, yeah.  Good thing. \nNICOLETTE Okay. \nEDDIE See you later.  Good luck. \nNICOLETTE Thank you. \nEDDIE Don't be late. \nShe walks out. \nINT. FIRE STATION 91 - DAY \nJordy unlocks the door.  Enters with Daphne.  The fire station is empty. \nJORDY The men are out of quarters - practicing putting out fires. \nDAPHNE So...the station is empty? \nJORDY Yeah.  This way. \nHe gestures toward the stairs. \nINT. FIRE STATION LOCKER ROOM - CONTINUOUS \nJordy and Daphne walk through the locker room.  Her eyes never leaving Jordy's. \nJORDY You considered becoming a prostitute? \nDAPHNE Yes, I considered it. \nJORDY Did you ever turn tricks before? \nDAPHNE No. \nJORDY What about back home? \nDAPHNE No. \nDaphne stops.  Looks at him.  Stands very close. \nDAPHNE (CONT'D) I came here.  I had no money.  I knew no one.  I couldn't get a job because you have to have a green card to get work. They approached me - I could've made a lot of money.  I considered it, but... it's not who I am.  They pay me below the table at Ludwig's. \nJORDY So you were never a prostitute? \nDAPHNE What are you asking me? \nJORDY I'm just trying to find out who you are. \nShe looks up into his eyes.  Searching.  Thinking he's hinting. \nDAPHNE Can you let me go? \nShe leans in close to him - giving him the opportunity to kiss her.  Jordy is tempted but...remembers Eddie's warning and backs up slightly. \nJORDY Showers are this way. \nDesperate now, willing to do anything, Daphne moves in even closer. \nDAPHNE You could shower with me. \nJordy is locked in her eyes.  Almost giving in.  Then breaks away.  Gestures towards the showers. Daphne looks away form him - crestfallen.  She heads to the showers.  Jordy follows her into the bathroom.  The walls are lined with shower stalls. \nJORDY I'll uh, I'll get you a towel. \nHe leaves her there.  Alone.  She quickly moves to the window.  Opens it.  Looks down.  It's a two-story drop to the street. \nJORDY \ngets a towel from the locker room.  His beeper goes off.  He checks the number but decides not to return the call.  We follow him back into the bathroom.  The shower is on but he notices the window.  It's open. \nJORDY (CONT'D) Shit! \nHe rushes over.  He looks out.  No sign of her.  He turns - looks back at the shower.  It's on but he can't see through the curtain.  Can't tell if she's there.  He walks over - quickly - fearing that she's left.  He pulls the curtain aside.  She's crouched in the corner shower stall.  Holding herself.  She looks up at him - her eyes filled with tears. \nJORDY (CONT'D) Are you alright? \n", "test2_true": "DAPHNE I'm not a whore.  I'm not a whore. \nJORDY I know. \nDAPHNE You don't know.  I'm sorry.  I was desperate.  That's not me.  I shot a cop.  Can you imagine what they'll do to me when I got to prison? \nJORDY They're not gonna send you right back. \nDAPHNE I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to...I'm glad. Actually I'm glad it's over.  All this time.  Hiding.  Never being able to look anyone in the eyes. Always afraid that someone would find out who I was.  Never trusting anyone... \nHe covers her with the towel, pulling her up. \nJORDY You can trust me. \nShe embraces him.  Trusting him.  He stands there for a moment.  Then awkwardly holds her.  Comforting her. INT. NYC RESTAURANT - DAY \nCLOSE UP \non a steak.  Male hands cut a piece.  Another male hand sets down a huge bottle of Extra Strength Excedrin.  The hands abandon the steak and rip open the bottle.  The CAMERA pulls back to include the LCD screen of Oleg's videocamera.  He is taping Emil as he rips open the safety plastic with his teeth.  Emil is sweating with fever and his eyes are glazed over in pain.  He 'drinks' pills from the bottle and chews them up.  Wincing in pain.  Emil washes them down with a beer. \nEmil looks down and the camera follows his gaze to the \"People\" magazine article he's reading on Stephen Geller. Emil laughs.  Shaking his head at the article as the videocamera tilts back up to his face. \nOLEG What is it? \nEMIL The video of Milos and Tamina - I told you to erase it. \nOLEG I did. \nEMIL And the whore's murder?  You didn't erase that either, did you?  Don't lie, I won't be angry. \nOLEG Why not? \nEMIL Put the camera down, Oleg. \nOleg closes the LCD screen and puts the camera down.  Emil removes a small address book -- from Leon's wallet - he looks up Eddie Flemming's name. \nOLEG What is that? \nEMIL What does it look like?  It's an address book! \nOleg jumps up with the camera to tape the book. \nOLEG Let me get a shot of it. \nEMIL Sit down! \nOLEG This way.  Hold it this way.  Good. \nOleg gets a shot and quickly sits back down. \nOLEG (CONT'D) Why won't you be angry at me for keeping my movie? \nEmil takes a gulp of beer - drops cash on the table and limps away.  Oleg follows. \nINT. PRECINCT - DAY \nIt's quiet - Chief Duffy paces in front of the Sergeant's desk.  Looking at his watch.  Growing more and more aggravated as every second ticks by.  Jordy enters escorting Daphne.  Sees Duffy and tires to go past him.  Duffy turns and sees Jordy and Daphne. \nDUFFY Hey.  Warsaw. \nJordy stops and comes back.  Sitting Daphne down on a bench. \nJORDY Hey, Chief, what are you doing here? \nDUFFY I came to see how the investigation was going. (looks at Daphne) I called and you're not here.  I wait up at the station and you don't even show up!!!  I beep you - you don't return my call.  Where the hell have you been?! \nJordy takes a few steps away from Daphne. \nJORDY Ladder 20 was on the Rock for training. We stopped there... so she could get cleaned up. \nDUFFY What do you mean, 'cleaned up?' \nJORDY I let her take a shower. \nDUFFY A shower!?  Did you take one, too? \nJORDY No!  Nothing happened. \nDUFFY Oh really.  That's nice.  You took a homicide witness to take a shower after your partner was shot?  Are you out of your fucking mind??  Are you having that much trouble gettin' dates?! \n", "test2_id": 2245, "test3_input": "EDDIE (O.S.) I told him to take her there. \nJordy and Duffy turn.  Eddie walks out.  Eddie turns - Tommy - the young detective who caught the case in the King Edward Hotel - is coming out of the back office. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Tommy, get her outta here. \nTommy takes Daphne into the precinct. \nTOMMY This way, ma'am. \nEDDIE There was too much press hangin' around there.  I didn't want her face on the news.  So I told him to take her to a quiet area until things settled down. \nDUFFY Oh. \nEDDIE It was my decision, not his. \nDUFFY Well, I'm the Deputy Chief Fire Marshall and every now and then I'd like to be included in decisions. \nEDDIE Look, after Jordy briefs me, you can do the press conference.  How about that? The case is all yours. \nDUFFY Oh yeah...?  Alright. \nEDDIE (to Jordy) I'm ready to be briefed. (to Duffy) Excuse us. \nDUFFY (to Eddie) Yeah, sure. (to Jordy) Beep me when you're ready for the press conference. \nJORDY Will do, Chief. \nEddie leads the way, walking past the Sergeant's desk - toward the back and to his office. \nJORDY (CONT'D) Eddie, I... \nEddie holds up his hand - silencing Jordy. \nEDDIE Wait. \nINT. POLICE PRECINCT - DETECTIVE ROOM'S SQUAD - DAY \nA handful of detectives talk about work over burned coffee. Eddie enters with Jordy. \nEDDIE Guys...give me a few minutes? \nThey empty out. \nJORDY Look, Eddie, I'm tellin' you - I didn't touch her. \nEDDIE Well, you shoulda because nobody's gonna believe you didn't...including me. \nJORDY I took her there for a shower and that's it. \nEDDIE Just a shower? \nEddie gives Jordy a questioning look. \nJORDY Yeah, just her in the shower.  Nothing happened.  Look, I'm sure you probably think I'm a fool and I fucked up, but... \nEDDIE No, I don't think you were a fool, I just think you were stupid about it.  I mean, to say the least, you outta know better.  You don't know her well enough. She's got the potential to fucking hang you even if she suggests that you made a pass at her, it's fuckin' over.  You can deny it all you want, but it will not make one fucking bit of difference. You're dead. \nJORDY I told you, you know, I thought I was doing the right thing, you know, I think she's innocent. \nEDDIE Well, it's not up to you to decide whether she's innocent or not.  Don't you understand, that's why you're a professional. \nJORDY But, I mean, didn't you ever go out on a limb for somebody?  I mean, you shoulda heard her there.  Tellin' her whole story...I believed her. \nEDDIE How you go out on a limb for somebody is by giving her a number of an Immigration lawyer.  Here, here's a number of an Immigration lawyer.  That's how you help her. But you can't get involved in her like that.  You're gonna jeopardize your career, your life and you're gonna jeopardize my case.  And lemme give you another piece of advice.  Maybe you don't watch TV but I'll let you in on a little secret - the whole fuckin' world watches television.  And when you get out there, they know your face.  And the little fame, the little fuckin' itty bitty fame that I get in this city makes it a lot easier for my job.  And I get more done because of it. \nJordy studies Eddie for a quiet beat. \nJORDY Why'd you help me back there with the Chief?  Why'd you stand up for me like that? \nEDDIE You know, I don't know.  I like you. You remind me of a puppy I used to have. He pissed on the rug all the time, but I still kept him. \nEddie picks up his cigar that's going out.  He sticks it in his mouth.  A match is lit.  He looks up.  Jordy holds the match.  Eddie dips the end of the cigar and puffs.  The homicide detective and the fire marshal hold a look. \nINT. EDDIE'S APARTMENT - NIGHT \nEddie walks in - carrying flowers.  He closes and locks the door behind him.  He grabs the phone.  Dials. \nEDDIE It's Flemming...anything turn up?  Did they check the hospitals?  Airports? Yeah, I hit him!  I fuckin' hit him!  We should be all over everywhere - with dogs, choppers, everything!  These guys are from fuckin' Czechoslovakia... \n", "test3_true": "EDDIE (CONT'D) I'll call you later. \nHe HANGS up.  Arranges the flowers in a vase.  So they look perfect.  Sets them on the coffee table.  Fills out a card, writes, \"Nicky, I love you. Will you marry me?\"  He sticks the card in the flowers - turns the lights down low.  Puts a romantic Sinatra song on the stereo.  Moves to the liquor cabinet.  Pours himself a drink.  He sets the ringbox on the coffee table - next to the flowers.  There's a knock at the door. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Coming! \nEddie smooths his hair, unlocks the door.  But the hallway is empty. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Nicky!?!? \nNo answer.  Eddie steps out in the hallway with the drink in his hand.  Walks toward the elevator.  Doesn't notice the shadow that passes behind him - entering his apartment. Eddie turns.  No sign of anyone. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) Nicky?! \nHe walks back toward his apartment.  Turns and locks the door.  A BLUR jumps out of the shadows SLAMMING him on the head with a gun.  Eddie tumbles to the floor!  OUT COLD! \nA BLURRED VIDEO IMAGE \nas it's focused - on Eddie - handcuffed and upper body taped to a chair - 20 minutes later - sobered up.  Emil is sitting in front of him.  On the coffee table alongside him are the flowers in a vase.  They've ransacked the place.  Emil has Eddie's watch, his gold shield and his money.  He's smoking one of Eddie's cigars and in Emil's hand...is the diamond engagement ring and card.  Oleg, 60 MINUTES-style, is positioned behind Emil videotaping Eddie.  He moves to the corner of the room - bringing a light back over to illuminate Eddie's face. \nEMIL So...who's Nicky? \nEDDIE What do you want? \nEMIL Your opinion. (leaning forward) You see, they going to make a movie about me, too, Eddie.  And write books. \nEDDIE (sarcastic) What's your accomplishment. \nEMIL I kill someone famous. \nEDDIE Then do it, asshole. \nEMIL Good - be tough to the end.  Actor who plays you will want to die like hero. \nEddie looks at the videocamera.  Emil answers Eddie's look. \nEMIL (CONT'D) So tabloids don't have to do re enactments.  They going to have real movie this time. \nEDDIE If you kill me and film it you're putting a noose around your neck. \nEmil turns to Oleg. \nEMIL Turn it off. \nOleg obeys.  Emil turns to Eddie. \nEMIL (CONT'D) No.  We are insane.  Who else but crazy men would film their murders? (gestures to Eddie) So we kill someone famous and if we are caught, we are sent to mental hospital. But what good is money there?  Because once in hospital I say I not crazy. Just pretended to be acquitted.  We see psychiatrists.  They must certify we are sane and because of your - what is law called? (Eddie says nothing) Oh - I got it.  Because of your Double Jeopardy law, we can't be tried for same crime twice.  We come out free, rich and famous! \nOLEG Good idea! \nEDDIE You really think you'll be able to fool a jury with this bullshit?  How fuckin' stupid are you? \nEMIL Smarter than Americans.  You're fed cry baby talk shows all day long.  Not only will Americans believe me, they'll cry for me. (laughs) So...Detective Eddie Flemming, would you like to say goodbye to your Nicolette? Maybe you can propose to her now? \nEddie says nothing.  Just stares at Emil.  Emil puffs on Eddie's cigar. \nEMIL (CONT'D) Okay.  He has nothing to say. (signaling Oleg) Start the camera! \nOLEG Cut! \nEmil looks at Oleg. \nOLEG (CONT'D) This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action!' \nEmil looks at Eddie as if to say, \"See what I have to put up with.\"  Oleg gestures from behind the videocamera. \nOLEG (CONT'D) And...action! \nOleg FILMS as Emil raises Eddie's service revolver.  Eddie suddenly KICKS at Emil's hand, but Emil pulls it away, backing out of Eddie's reach. \nEMIL Bad last moment - I cut that out. \nEmil raises the pistol again - pointing the gun at Eddie's left temple.  Emil cocks the hammer, but Eddie avoids the gun, ducking his head to the side of Emil's arm.  Standing and following his head up Emil's arm and pushing him over into the desk.  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk and onto the floor. \nOleg still grips the videocamera.  Eddie continues around with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall. \nEddie comes back from Oleg to the gun at the same time as Emil is limping for it.  Eddie knocks Emil out of the way with the chair and then stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. \nEddie comes up and around again at Oleg who is coming at him from the wall.  Eddie knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa.  Falling on top of him, rolling over and leaving Oleg on the sofa. \n", "test3_id": 2246}

{"test1_input": "LOUIE Lieutenant - take up your line and relieve Ladder Company 60 on the top floor. \nJORDY Hey, Louie, were you first due? \nLOUIE Yeah, I radioed you guys right away 'cause you got two roasts on the top floor but you don't hafta investigate cause homicide is up there. \nJORDY Homicide?  Who let them up?  I didn't make it a crime scene yet. \nLOUIE Hey, it's Eddie Flemming. \nKORFIN (O.S.) Yo, Jordy! \nBOBBY KORFIN - an overweight arson investigator with a quick with and good sense of humor - comes over, pulling on a turnout coat. \nKORFIN (CONT'D) Where you been, man?  We got a celebrity! \nJORDY I heard.  Who the hell let them up there? \nKORFIN I don't know, you think Eddie will give me his autograph? \nJORDY You see anything in the crowd?  Anybody suspicious? \nKORFIN Naw - I'm sure the suspect's not here. \nJORDY Oh yeah, why? \nKORFIN 'Cause Eddie woulda locked him up by now! \nINT. MILOS' APARTMENT - NIGHT \nThe roof is gone.  The sky is exposed.  It's charred ruins, smoked beams and watery muck.  Eddie and Leon are standing by what's left of the mattress, looking at Milos and Tamina's charred bodies.  Eddie grips a half-smoked Cuban cigar, listening to Leon. \nLEON So, it looks to me - from the sixty-nine position - that they were doin' each other but were so whacked out of their heads they set the pipe on the mattress, lit it up, and they got fried.  What do you think, Eddie? \nJordy enters - with Korfin who's carrying a paint can. \nEDDIE I don't know.  We got the experts here. Show them what you found - I hope you don't mind, we came over to see if we could help. \nKorfin makes a beeline for Eddie - wanting to meet the celebrity. \nKORFIN Nah, not at all.  Detective Flemming - Bobby Korfin.  My Uncle Tony worked with you at 2-1 back when you were a rookie. \nJORDY Could you put out the cigar?  Part of the job is picking up scents. \nEDDIE Oh, sure. \nEddie puts his cigar out.  Carefully slides it into a cigar holder and pockets it to finish later. \nLEON Well, I found - check it out - crack pipe.  Looks like they got careless. \nLeon displays the pipe Emil found on the stairs.  Korfin shines the flashlight on Leon to look at the pipe. \nLEON (CONT'D) Mind not shining that light in my eyes? \nKORFIN Sorry, bro. \nJORDY Hey, that's great you guys got it all wrapped up, but you don't mind if we go through the routine?  It gives us somethin' to do. \nEDDIE No, we don't mind.  You mind Leon? \nLEON No.  Go ahead. \nJORDY Thanks.  Appreciate it. \nJordy throws a look at Korfin.  Homicide detectives have no respect for fire marshals' investigative skills.  Eddie rummages through the apartment - moving into the kitchen and living room... Leon watches as Korfin sticks a pencil in a charred beam, measuring how deep in it goes. \nKORFIN Okay, Jordy - it was a fast fire, we got good patterns - about thirty minutes old. \nJordy moves to one of the corpses.  He pulls on a white rubber glove.  Inserts his finger in the corpses mouth.  The glove comes out white. \nJORDY Mouth's clean, too. \nKORFIN Clean? \nJORDY Don't blow your nose! \nJordy's looking at Leon, who was just about to blow his nose. \nJORDY (CONT'D) The smoke'll permeate your nostrils - burn 'em out.  Let it run. \n", "test1_true": "Leon looks at Jordy, then lowers the handkerchief.  Jordy turns back to the corpses on the bed.  Eddie - in the other room - has found Tamina's brushed gold bracelet on the floor. \nJORDY So the way you see it, two crack heads burned themselves up? \nLEON That's what it looks like to me. \nJORDY And while they're burning up, they're still goin' down on each other?  You got to hand it to them. \nLEON (realizes he's wrong - blows it off) Yeah, well, some people got their priorities straight. \nLeon watches Jordy, quietly.  With a pair of tweezers, Jordy pulls a small unburned piece of cloth from behind one of the heads.  Korfin supplies the paint can.  Jordy drops the cloth inside. \nLEON (CONT'D) What was that? \nJORDY Evidence.  Of a homicide. \nThat got Eddie's attention and he comes back to the bedroom. \nJORDY (CONT'D) You know what that is, right? \nEDDIE No, what is it? \nJORDY Why don't you explain it, Bobby. (to a fireman joking a wall) Hey Camello!  You mind punching a hole in the floor? \nCAMELLO No problem. (to Eddie and Leon) Excuse me, gentlemen.  You might wanna back up a little more.  Don't wanna get your pants wet. \nLeon and Eddie move to higher ground - on top of a burnt TV set.  Eddie hands the brushed bracelet to Leon.  As Camello hacks at the floor with an ax, Jordy continues to examine the bodies and Korfin explains: \nKORFIN They have not soot in their mouths, which means they weren't breathin' before the fire and that usually means they were deceased - and this piece of cloth that my partner found means they were wrapped up in something, probably doused with a flammable liquid and positioned like this on the bed.  To the untrained eye, it looks like an accident. \nJordy kicks around the draining floor, reaches down for something. \nLEON What's he looking for? \nEDDIE A timer. \nJordy finds some wires attached to an outlet, pulls them up - on the other end is a timer.  Korfin takes the timer from Jordy and moves to Eddie. \nKORFIN Here you go.  A big double homicide. \nEXT. MILOS' APARTMENT BUILDING - NIGHT \nAs Jordy and Korfin exit the brownstone, a CAMERA CREW is arriving.  Jumps out. Korfin and Jordy cross toward Korfin's car.  They open the trunk.  Take off their muddy boots throwing them in. \nKORFIN You see Eddie's face when I gave him the timer?  Wish I had a picture of it. \nJORDY He knew all along. \nKORFIN What?? \nJORDY That's why he was so quiet.  He was testing us. \nEddie and Leon exit - Eddie carrying a baggie with a timer inside.  NICOLETTE KARAS, young and attractive, pushes her microphone at Eddie.  She's smart, aggressive and respected by her peers. \nNICOLETTE Detective, does it look like a murder? \nEDDIE We don't know that yet.  It's much too early.  There's a lot to be done. \nNICOLETTE How many victims are up there? \nEDDIE There are two bodies found at this point. \nNICOLETTE Can we go up to the crime scene? \nEDDIE You know you can't do that.  C'mon. \nNICOLETTE Is it drug related? \nEDDIE We don't know.  When I have more I'll let you know. \nNicolette signals for her camera man, MIKE, to zoom in on Eddie's hand.  She barrels on... \nNICOLETTE Detective...what's that you're holding in your hand?  Evidence? \nMike pans up to Eddie's face.  Other reporters arrive, hurling questions which Eddie easily answers.  Cameras flash as we PAN BACK TO Korfin and Jordy.  Jordy is about to get in the car as he notices, back behind some construction - DAPHNE HANDLOVA.  She's still wearing the crumpled summer dress. She tentatively steps out to signal Jordy.  He only catches a glimpse of her.  He starts toward her -- knifes through the crowd - but Daphne is gone. \nKORFIN What? \nJORDY There was a woman - I think she wanted to talk to us.  She looked scared.  Oh shit!  Oh no! \n", "test1_id": 2244, "test2_input": "DAPHNE I will if they don't send me back. \nJORDY They won't until this is over. \nShe looks away.  Out the window.  Jordy sees emotion filling her eyes.  She looks back at him - her eyes have teared up. \nDAPHNE Are you married? \nJORDY Divorced. \nDAPHNE Do you live alone? (beat) I've been in these clothes since...the killings.  Could we stop at your place? I could take a shower...before I go into custody? \nJordy looks at her.  Can't quite tell if she's trying to manipulate him or really just wants to get cleaned up before all the shit starts. \nJORDY I can't take you to my place. \nDAPHNE Somewhere else? \nJordy looks at her... \nEDDIE \nStaring right at us. \nEDDIE I want to talk to you about something serious. \nHe holds up the diamond engagement ring. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) I want to live the rest of my life with you...I don't know you've been married before and I've never been married, but I do love you, and... \nEddie is standing in front of a mirror - rehearsing the proposal.  He notices a small dab of blood on his shirtcuff. Leon's blood.  Paulie enters carrying a towel and a vodka tonic. \nPAULIE She's here. \nPaulie sets down the drink and begins their silent ritual. He hands Eddie the towel.  Eddie wipes off his face and hands, then hands the towel back to Paulie.  Paulie helps Eddie on with his coat.  Eddie takes some Visine out of his coat pocket.  Drops a few in each eye.  HE straightens himself and looks in the mirror, taking a big gulp of the drink.  Eddie sets the glass down and starts out.  Paulie hands him a Binaca.  Eddie gives himself a squirt as he exits.  Paulie follows. \nINT. P.B. HERMAN'S RESTAURANT - DAY \nIt's lunchtime...it's crowded.  Eddie takes a seat at a table.  He takes the ring out of his pocket - holds it under the table.  Nicolette Karas walks up to Eddie from behind. Gives him a kiss on the cheek. \nNICOLETTE Hey, honey. \nEDDIE Hey. \nShe orders a drink in Greek from the Greek waiter, then sits down across the table.  There's a long pause - they just look at each other. \nNICOLETTE What is your problem?  Why'd you snap at me?  I just wanted a statement. \nEDDIE I can't...I can't answer you just because you want me to answer you! \nNICOLETTE You didn't have to embarrass me in front of my colleagues.  You could give me something. \nEDDIE Oh, I'm sorry.  Did I embarrass you, sweetheart?  Oh... \nNICOLETTE Stop it. \nEDDIE Maybe I should just, ya know...turn to the cameras and say, do you mind if we just work something out? \nNICOLETTE Alright, alright, Eddie.  Don't patronize me. \nEDDIE I'm not. \nNICOLETTE Yes you are.  I'm not just some reporter.  I don't just stick a microphone in your face.  You could give me something. \nEDDIE Yeah, well you took the camera and put it right down on the evidence.  That was... \nNICOLETTE That was good.  You were holding the evidence. \nEDDIE You were merciless.  You didn't give a shit if you got me or not. \nNICOLETTE Well, who was it that taught me how to do that?  Huh? \nEDDIE You're ruthless. \nNICOLETTE You're not so bad yourself. \nThey look at each other. \nNICOLETTE (CONT'D) C'mere. \n", "test2_true": "NICOLETTE (CONT'D) Look at this.  You have blood on your shirt.  Whose is it? \nEDDIE Could be Leon's. \nNICOLETTE Jesus.  And last week you came over with blood on your shoes.  What am I going to do with you? \nEddie takes her hand. \nEDDIE You know, I been thinkin'...these shoes might look nice with another pair of shoes next to them in the closet. \nShe looks at him. \nEDDIE (CONT'D) You know, Nicky, I've been married twice before.  My first wife was a professional woman, didn't have time for children.  My second wife...I never wanted to go home to her. \nNicolette's phone rings.  Eddie stops - looks at the ringing phone. \nNICOLETTE What are you doing?  What are you saying? \nNicolette's phone keeps ringing.  Eddie stares at it. \nNICOLETTE (CONT'D) Eddie? \nNicolette's phone keeps ringing. \nNICOLETTE (CONT'D) Don't worry about the damn phone.  I won't answer it. \nEDDIE Answer the phone. \nNICOLETTE No.  Tell me what you want to say. \nEDDIE Answer it. \nNICOLETTE Okay.  Okay.  Hold that thought just for a second.  They only call me when it's an emergency.  Just hold that thought. (into the phone) Can you call back? \nPHONE VOICE (O.S.) We need you here in twenty minutes.  Get in a cab. \nNICOLETTE What're you talking about? \nPHONE VOICE (O.S.) Katie.  We don't know where she is.  We can't find her.  You gotta anchor the 5:00.  This is your shot.  Come now. \nNICOLETTE What?  Oh.  Okay.  Yeah. \nThe line disconnects.  She collapses the phone.  Turns to Eddie. \nNICOLETTE (CONT'D) Oh my G-d, they want me to anchor.  They want me to anchor tonight! \nEDDIE That's good. \nNICOLETTE Yeah. \nEDDIE Well, that's great. \nNICOLETTE Okay.  That is great.  But I can't go now, we're in the middle of something here. \nEDDIE No.  Go ahead.  You're gonna be great. \nNICOLETTE No.  No, listen to me here.  I want to know what you're talking about.  You know, the shoe thing and the marriages and... \nEDDIE I'll tell you tonight.  Let's do it tonight.  As soon as you get back we'll talk.  We'll talk. \nNICOLETTE Promise? \nEDDIE I promise.  We'll talk.  You'll be great.  You'll be fine.  Go ahead, just imagine that, uh... Just look into the lens and imagine you're talking to me. \nNICOLETTE Yeah.  I'll do that.  As long as you're not patronizing me. \nEDDIE Patronizing you... Nay, I love you. \nNICOLETTE I love you. \nThey kiss. \nNICOLETTE (CONT'D) Okay, til tonight. \nEDDIE Tonight. \nNICOLETTE You promise? \nEDDIE Yeah.  I promise. \n", "test2_id": 2245, "test3_input": "JORDY They were inside.  They booby trapped her apartment! \nKorfin scans the crowd.  Looking for Emil and Oleg.  In the b.g., Duffy is SCREAMING. \nDUFFY What the hell are you talking about??? They're gonna do what? \nJordy and Korfin turn.  The Chief has a phone to his ear and is freaked. \nINT. LOBBY OF CHANNEL 12 BROADCASTING - NIGHT \nJORDY'S POV \nas he enters the TV station.  His clothes burnt and still wet.  The lobby's full of ANGRY COPS.  Tommy and Leon, still in his funeral suit, SCREAMING above them all at Maggie the producer and her ASSISTANT, who are standing behind the desk. \nTOMMY Where is he?!  Where is Hawkins?! \nMAGGIE He's not on the premises! \nLEON I want the tape.  Go get it and bring it here this minute. \nMAGGIE Any request for the video must be directed to \"Top Story's\" attorney - Bruce Cutler.  I'll be happy to give you his number. \nLeon jumps over the desk where Maggie stands.  Tommy pushes past the security guard to follow Leon.  They continue toward Maggie, pushing her further back into the office.  She tries to protect herself with an office door which Leon slams open. \nLEON Lady, if you put Eddie's murder on TV, I'll get a warrant for your arrest and shove it so far up your ass it'll come outta your mouth! \nMAGGIE I want your shield number! \nHAWKINS (O.S.) Viewer discretion advised! \nMAGGIE (pointing at the TV) You want the tape?  There it is! \nLeon, Tommy, all the cops and Jordy - turn toward a TV set which is mounted in the lobby.  The \"Top Story\" logo flashes on the screen, then Robert Hawkins is seen behind his desk. \nHAWKINS What we are about to broadcast is very graphic footage... \nEveryone is riveted.  But Jordy notices outside...a \"Top Story\" NEWS VAN is waiting in the alley.  Robert Hawkins jumps from a doorway and into the van.  Jordy backs out. \nINT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - NIGHT \nPOP...a video POV of a bottle of Crystal as the cork is popped.  The videocamera pans up to Emil sitting at the table.  He nods at the waiter who leaves.  Emil raises the glass - looking into the lens. \nEMIL America!  Who says you can't be success in America?  I arrived with nothing, knowing nobody - now look - I am a success story! \nThe videocamera is lowered.  Oleg turns it off.  Asks suspiciously. \nOLEG You are success story?  I am success story!  Why do you say I and not we? \nEMIL Oleg, don't be paranoid.  You got a hundred-fifty thousand dollars, didn't you?  I gave you half of what they gave me.  Look - here we are! \nEmil gestures toward the big television set.  We are in Planet Hollywood - where diners and those by the bar can watch a huge screen hanging from the ceiling.  Robert Hawkins is introducing his show. \nHAWKINS (ON T.V.) Good evening.  Welcome to \"Top Story\". Tonight, I present to you material of a graphic and violent nature never before seen on television.  And I do so with a heavy heart.  You will be first-hand witness to the slaying of celebrated New York City Homicide Detective, Eddie Flemming.  It would be only normal to ask, why?  Why are we showing something so journalist, I must show it.  A democracy survives through the freedom of its media, and if we cannot see what is happening then we don't deserve our democracy, or our freedom.  Eddie Flemming was my friend.  I cried when I watched this footage and vowed to fight this violence with every molecule of my being from this day onward.  Hopefully, this will have a similar effect on you. One final word, this material is absolutely not appropriate for children. \nThe restaurant BUZZES.  Emil checks his watch. \nOLEG In movie they make of us, who do you think would act me? \nEMIL The one who got caught in the bathroom. (beat) George Michael. \nEmil laughs.  Oleg doesn't. \nOLEG I'm serious. \nEMIL Shut up.  Look! \nEmil points towards the TV.  \"Top Story\" is continuing.  The scene cuts to Emil's video footage.  Eddie is handcuffed to the chair.  The light illuminating his face. \nOLEG (O.S.) This is my project.  I say 'action.'  I am the director!  You are the talent. You wait for me to say 'action.' (beat) And 'action!' \nEMIL Bad last moment - I cut it out. \nEmil looks at Oleg - furious. \nEMIL (CONT'D) I told you to cut that out before we handed in the tape! \nOLEG Be quiet.  Watch. \nOleg watches the big-screen TV as Emil raises the pistol to Eddie's temple.  Eddie pushes him over the desk.  Eddie then knocks Emil with the chair and Emil falls off the desk onto the floor.  Eddie continues around with the chair and drives Oleg back across the room - pinning him to the wall.  Eddie and Emil both go for the gun.  Eddie knocks him out of the way.  Stabs him with the legs of the chair repeatedly. Leaves him in a ball on the floor.  Oleg comes at Eddie and he knocks Oleg over the coffee table and onto the sofa.  The blinds and lamp shade are shot - bathing the room with more light.  Emil stabs Eddie in the stomach.  Oleg kneels down for a CLOSE-UP. \n", "test3_true": "EXT. TIMES SQUARE - CONTINUOUS \nHawkins' van drives across Times Square.  Jordy's car following.  We WIDEN OUT... Eddie's murder is being broadcast on the JUMBOTRON in Times Square.  People stare up - stunned. \nINT. PLANET HOLLWYOOD - CONTINUOUS \nThe dinner patrons are watching TV.  Shocked.  Emil glares at Oleg. \nEMIL Why did you leave that stuff in about you being the director? \nOLEG Because I am the director.  Don't you realize, if it wasn't for my film, for my talent, my idea to do this - no way would we be sitting here right now. \nEMIL Your idea?  I thought it was my idea. \nOleg tenses.  Emil laughs. \nEMIL (CONT'D) Aren't you just the cameraman? \nOleg doesn't laugh. \nOLEG I'm serious...this - this is a great American film.  Full of violence and sex.  And I want my credit. \nEMIL Credit? \nOLEG Yes.  Before we hand in the next video - I put titles on it and my credit is going to read - Directed by Oleg Razgul. \nEMIL Yes.  But there's only one problem - you want credit but the problem is - I don't share credit. \nOleg is pissed. \nEMIL (CONT'D) You got that? \nOLEG No, I don't get that! \nEMIL You think you are a director?  You are a fucking little, small Russian piece of shit.  And I hate you.  I fucking hate you. \nEmil slaps Oleg across the face.  Oleg stands up.  Emil suddenly pulls out Eddie's gun but before he can pull the trigger, Oleg STABS Emil in the arm!  Emil squeezes off a shot through the crowded restaurant.  Patrons SCREAM - Oleg runs through the restaurant, escaping.  It's chaos. Hawkins arrives with a crew and with BRUCE CUTLER, a confident, tough criminal attorney. \nEmil pulls the steak knife out of his arm, picks up a napkin - pressing it to his wound. \nEMIL (CONT'D) Oh, hello. \nCutler accesses the situation. \nEMIL (CONT'D) Are you my attorney? (extends his hand to Cutler) I'm Emil.  I'm insane. \nCUTLER I'm not your lawyer until I see the money. \nEMIL Here.  I have your money. \nEmil picks up a briefcase and hands it to Cutler.  Cutler opens it - inside is the cash Emil got from Robert Hawkins. Emil looks at the table, pushing the plates and silverware aside.  Emil looks under the table, throwing the chair aside, freaking.  He's lost the most important thing in his life. \nEMIL (CONT'D) Oh no!  No!  Shit! \nCUTLER (follows Emil - reaching out to him) Emil.  Take it easy.  Stay with me.  Sit down.  What do you need?  What are you looking for? \nEMIL He has the camera!  He took the movie! \nJordy comes in, gun raised. \nJORDY Don't move!  Don't move!  Get your hands up!  Drop it! \nEmil puts his hands in the air.  Immediately drops the gun! \nEMIL I give up! \nJordy is disappointed!  He didn't want to take Emil alive. Hawkins signals to his camera man, who swings his camera at Jordy as he approaches Emil, his gun aimed at Emil's head. \nCUTLER This man is unarmed, officer.  He's surrendered. \nJordy cracks Emil across the face - knocking him down. \nCUTLER (CONT'D) What are you hitting him for? \nJORDY Turn that camera off! \nJordy handcuffs him.  Emil turns to the camera for sympathy, appearing more hurt than he is. \nEMIL No.  Keep filming... \n", "test3_id": 2246}

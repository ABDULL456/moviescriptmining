FADE IN: 
INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:06PM 
Union Station, that gorgeous fifty-year-old monument to Art Deco/California Mission architecture. Still beautiful. Still grand. 
A sign at one of the departure/arrival gates in the main concourse-says the "San Diegan", number 2 64, is due at 12:00. 
Set above the gates, a big clock - six feet in diameter. 
THE TIME - 
We see the big hand slam into "7". 
A loudspeaker - you can just about understand this guy. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Amtrack 2 64, the San Diegan, from San Diego, Del Mar... 
EXT. UNION STATION PLATFORM - DAY - 12:06PM 
The "San Diegan" pulls into the terminal and comes to a slow, grinding stop. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...San Clemente, San Juan Capistrano, and Irvine is now arriving at Gate Nine. 
Doors are opened. Steps set down. Passengers pour out. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) Amtrack 264 will be departing in fifteen minutes from Gate Nine for Oxnard, Ventura... 
INT. UNION STATION - DAY - 12:07PM 
A MAN and A WOMAN stand with a view of the arrival doors. He's a blue-collar tough guy, dressed for church. She's his beefy counterpart. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...Santa Barbara, Lompoc... 
THE GUY (MR. SMITH) checks his watch. 
ANNOUNCER (V.O.) ...Santa Maria, San Luis Obispo... 
Then he looks up to the big clock. 
The minute hand slams into the "8". 
ANNOUNCER ...and points north. 
He resets his watch as DISEMBARKING PASSENGERS pour out of the gate. PEOPLE run forward with kisses and hugs. 
MR. SMITH Look sharp. 
They stand like a couple of rocks, their eyes scanning the crowd. 
MS. JONES That one. 
MR. SMITH Nah.  Hates his wife. 
They're talking about a couple in their forties.  She motormouths her way across the terminal and the husband follows with the suitcases. 
WHOOSH! A couple of TEENAGE BOYS on rollerblades zip by. 
MS. JONES I hate rollerblades. 
EXT. UNION STATION - PLATFORM - DAY - 12:08PM 
The train.. A PRETTY SIX-YEAR-OLD GIRL (LYNN) , who is holding a stuffed animal almost as large as she is, climbs down the steps. She reaches the platform, looks around. From within the train: 
GENE Lynn!  Lynn!! 
GENE WATSON, thirtyish, a regular Joe in appearance and inclination, appears above, carrying a couple small suitcases. He takes a relieved breath when he sees  her. 
GENE Lynn, don't walk ahead of me, OK?

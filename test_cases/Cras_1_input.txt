INT. VAUGHAN'S WORKSHOP -- NIGHT 
James follows Vaughan down a cramped corridor to a photographic workshop formed out of a warren of small rooms. Vaughan eases James into the first room and then carefully closes the door behind them. 
JAMES Do you live here? With Seagrave? 
VAUGHAN (laughs) I live in my car. This is my workshop. 
Pinned to the walls and lying on the benches among the enamel pails are hundreds of photographs. The floor around the enlarger is littered with half-plate prints, developed and cast aside once they have yielded their images. Vaughan makes a sweeping gesture that takes in all the photographs. 
VAUGHAN And this is the new project, Ballard. 
As Vaughan hunts around the central table, turning the pages of a leather-bound album, James looks down at the discarded prints below his feet. Most of them are crude frontal pictures of motor-cars and heavy vehicles involved in highway collisions, surrounded by spectators and police, and close- ups of impacted radiator grills and windshields. 
Vaughan opens the album at random and hands it to James. He leans back against the door and watches as James adjusts the desk lamp. 
The first thirty pages record the crash, hospitalization, and post-recuperative romance of the young woman Gabrielle -- a social worker, the photos suggest -- who is currently getting very stoned in the next room. 
By coincidence, her small sports car had collided with an airline bus at the entry to the airport not far from the site of James's own accident. Vaughan had obviously been there, shooting film, moments after the crash. The incredibly detailed photos end with her affair with her physical therapy instructor. 
The remainder of the album describes the course of James's own accident and recovery, and includes his sexual encounters with Renata, Helen Remington, and his own wife, Catherine. Vaughan stands at James's shoulder, like an instructor ready to help a promising pupil. 
James closes the book. 
JAMES What kind of help can I possibly be to you? You seem to be everywhere at once as it is. 
At that moment, there is a knock at the door, and then Gabrielle enters and takes a few stiff steps into the room on her shackled legs. She holds out a couple of joints to Vaughan. 
GABRIELLE Thought you might be missing these. (to James) So here you are at the nerve centre. Vaughan makes everything look like a crime, doesn't he? 
Vaughan takes the joints and lights them both. He hands one to James, who takes it gratefully. 
JAMES What exactly is your project, Vaughan? A book of crashes? A medical study? A sensational documentary? Global traffic? 
VAUGHAN It's something we're all intimately involved in: the reshaping of the human body by modern technology.

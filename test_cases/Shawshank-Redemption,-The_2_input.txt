Brooks nods, never missing a beat. He rolls his cart to Andy's cell, mutters through the bars: 
BROOKS Middle shelf, wrapped in a towel. 
Andy's hand snakes through the bars and makes the object disappear. The hand comes back and deposits a small slip of folded paper along with more cigarettes. Brooks turns his cart around and goes back. He pauses, sorting his books long enough for Red to snag the slip of paper. Brooks continues on, scooping the cigarettes off the cart and into his pocket. 
44	INT -- RED'S CELL -- NIGHT (1947) 44 
Red unfolds the slip of paper. Penciled neatly on it is a single word: "Thanks." 
45	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1947) 45 
We are assaulted by the deafening noise of the laundry line. Andy is doing his job, getting good at it. 
BOB DUFRESNE! WE'RE LOW ON HEXLITE! HEAD ON BACK AND FETCH US UP SOME! 
Andy nods. He leaves the line, weaving his way through the laundry room and into -- 
46	INT -- BACK ROOMS/STOCK AREA -- DAY (1947) 46 
-- a dark, tangled maze of rooms and corridors, boilers and furnaces, sump pumps, old washing machines, pallets of cleaning supplies and detergents, you name it. Andy hefts a cardboard drum of Hexlite off the stack, turns around -- 
-- and finds Bogs Diamond in the aisle. blocking his way. Rooster looms from the shadows to his right, Pete Verness on the left. A frozen beat. Andy slams the Hexlite to the floor, rips off the top, and scoops out a double handful. 
ANDY You get this in your eyes, it blinds you. 
BOGS Honey, hush. 
Andy backs up, holding them at bay, trying to maneuver through the maze. The Sisters keep coming, tense and guarded, eyes riveted and gauging his every move, trying to outflank him. Andy trips on some old gaint sugglies. That's all it takes. They're on him in an instant, kicking and stomping. 
Andy gets yanked to his feet. Bogs applies a chokehold from behind. They propel him across the room and slam him against an old four-pocket machine, bending him over it. Rooster jams a rag into Andy's mouth and secures it with a steel pipe, like a horse bit. Andy kicks and struggles, but Rooster and Pete have his arms firmly pinned. Bogs whispers in Andy's ear: 
BOGS That's it, fight. Better that way. 
Andy starts screaming, muffled by the rag. CAMERA PULLS BACK, SLOWLY WIDENING. The big Washex blocks our view. All we see is Andy's screaming face and the men holding him down... 
...and CAMERA DRIFTS FROM THE ROOM, leaving the dark place and the dingy act behind...MOVING up empty corridors, past concrete walls and steel pipes... 
RED (V.O.) I wish I could tell you that Andy fought the good fight, and the Sisters let him be. I wish I could tell you that, but prison is no fairy-tale world. 
WE EMERGE into the prison laundry past a guard, WIDENING for a final view of the line. The giant steel "mangler" is slapping down in brutal rhythm. The sound is deafening. 
RED (V.O.) He never said who did it...but we all knew. 
PRISON MONTAGE: (1947 through 1949) 
47 	ANDY PLODS THROUGH HIS DAYS. WORKING. EATING. CHIPPING AND 47 shaping his rocks after lights-out... 
RED (V.O.) Things went on like that for a while. Prison life consists of routine, and then more routine. 
48 	ANDY WALKS THE YARD, FACE SWOLLEN AND BRUISED. 48 
RED (V.O.) Every so often, Andy would show up with fresh bruises. 
49 	ANDY EATS BREAKFAST. A FEW TABLES OVER, BOGS BLOWS HIM A KISS. 49 
RED (V.O.) The Sisters kept at him. Sometimes he was able to fight them off... sometimes not. 
50 	ANDY BACKS INTO A CORNER IN SOME DINGY PART OF THE PRISON, wildly swinging a rake at his tormentors. 
RED (V.O.) He always fought, that's what I remember. He fought because he knew if he didn't fight, it would make it that much easier not to fight the next time. 
The rake connects, snapping off over somebody's skull. They beat the hell out of him. 
RED (V.O.) Half the time it landed him in the infirmary... 
51	INT -- SOLITARY CONFINEMENT ("THE HOLE") -- NIGHT (1949) 51 
A stone closet. No bed, sink, or lights. Just a toilet with no seat. Andy sits on bare concrete, bruised face lit by a faint ray of light falling through the tiny slit in the steel door. 
RED (V.O.) ...the other half, it landed him in solitary. Warden Norton's "grain & drain" vacation. Bread, water, and all the privacy you could want. 
52	INT -- PRISON LAUNDRY -- DAY (1949) 52 
Andy is working the line. 
RED (V.O.) And that's how it went for Andy. That was his routine. I do believe those first two years were the worst for him. And I also believe if things had gone on that way, this place would have got the best of him. But then, in the spring of 1949, the powers-that-be decided that... 
53	EXT -- PRISON YARD -- DAY (1949) 53 
Warden Norton addresses the assembled cons via bullhorn: 
NORTON ...the roof of the license-plate factory needs resurfacing. I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work. We're gonna be taking names in this steel bucket here... 
Red glances around at his friends. Andy also catches his eye.

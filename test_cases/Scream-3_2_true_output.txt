INT.  SID'S OFFICE - NIGHT 
Sid sits in a cluttered office. On the wall hangs a poster forthe FALL OF TROY (her play from SCREAM 2) and a poster proclaiming WOMEN'S RIGHTS with CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS center written beneath that. 
A THREE-RING BINDER with a cover boasting CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S CRISIS CENTER is thrown open. 
THE PHONE-- 
SID PUTS ON A HEADSET, dials a number. RINGING. 
SIDNEY (into headset) This is Laura in Monterey reporting in for work. 
OPERATOR(O.S.) Alright Laura I'll patch you right in to a call. 
SIDNEY Thanks. 
A click. A woman's voice comes on the other line. It sounds very familiar. 
WOMAN(O.S.) Hello? 
SIDNEY Yes, hi I'm Laura, I'm a trained counselor. How can I help you. 
WOMAN(O.S.) Laura I think I just killed somebody. 
SIDNEY Are you sure? 
WOMAN(O.S.) Uh-huh I'm sure. I've killed someone! OH MY GOD I'VE ACTUALLY KILLED SOMEONE! 
SIDNEY Well then the people you need to call are the police. 
WOMAN(O.S.) No I need to call you. Just you. 
SIDNEY I'm sorry, your voice. 
WOMAN(O.S.) Don't you want to know how you can help, Sidney? (a beat, Sid goes blank) Are you listening to me, huh? 
SIDNEY Who the fuck is this? 
WOMAN(O.S.) It's mother, Sidney, now be a good girl and turn on the news. DO IT! 
Sid reaches for the remote control, flips on a small TV lying across the office.

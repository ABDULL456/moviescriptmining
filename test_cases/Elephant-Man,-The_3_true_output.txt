ANNE Frederick, why are you so interested in this particular case? 
TREVES I don't know. I can't explain it. If this is an intelligent man, trapped in the body of a monster, then I'm under a moral obligation to help free that mind, free that spirit as best I can, to help him live as full and content a life as possible. But! If he's an imbecile, who's body I can't treat and who's mind I can't touch, well, then my obligation is discharged. They can put him where they will; he won't be bothered, I won't be bothered, and everyone's conscience can remain free and untroubled. And that is my dilemma... what is in his mind? 
Anne, sympathizing with his concerns goes to him and puts her arms around him. 
ANNE Perhaps you're just polishing a stone, endowing this Elephant Man with qualities he doesn't possess? 
TREVES (impatiently) And what qualities are those? Intelligence or stupidity? 
ANNE (slightly hurt) I'm sure I don't know, Freddie. 
She releases Treves and lies down. Treves realizes that perhaps he has been unkind. 
TREVES I'm sorry... I don't know either. I just don't know. 
ANNE Well, these things take time. 
TREVES I've only got until two o'clock tomorrow afternoon, when Carr Gomm meets him. Somehow, between now and then I've got to make John Merrick at least seem like an intelligent man... Why am I fooling myself? Nothing short of John delivering the Sermon on the Mount is going to sway Carr Gomm... 
Anne sits back up and gently places her hand over Treves' mouth. As she does so she leans forward and turns out the light. 
ISOLATION WARD 
Merrick is propped up in bed. Suddenly the door bursts open. The Night Porter, an arm around a drunken giggling tart, stands in the doorway. As soon as the Charwoman sees Merrick, she screams as does Merrick, and she wriggles free, making for the stairs. The Night Porter watches her go and then turns to Merrick laughing noisily. He then pulls the door shut with a bang. 
Merrick, very frightened, crawls down into his hiding place. 
BEDROOM (MORNING) 
We see Anne alone in bed, asleep. Treves is finished dressing and leaves the room. The sound of the door closing awakens Anne. She looks around for Treves. A clock reads 5:30. 
ISOLATION WARD 
Merrick's disguise hangs on the wall. 
MERRICK (V.O.) The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want, he maketh me to lie down in green pastures; He leadeth me beside still waters. He restoreth my soul: He Guideth me in the paths of righteousness... 
TREVES Righteousness... 
MERRICK (V.O.) Righteousness for his namesake. 
WE NOW SEE TREVES AND MERRICK 
TREVES Very good, very good. Now, when your visitor comes today I want you to say it exactly the way you said it just now. I will introduce him to you and you will say the words you've learned. If you have any trouble with any of the words, I'll help you. I'm sure you'll be just fine. If you do as well for him as you've done for me these last two days, then I'm sure our visitor will be very pleased. Now, let's go through the whole thing again, shall we? I will say "May I introduce you to Mr. Carr Gomm." And you will say... 
MERRICK Hello, my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you! 
HALLWAY 
Treves and Carr Gomm are speaking together as they walk along. 
TREVES It's only a physical problem. He has trouble with certain sounds because of the constrictive deformity of the mouth. But he can talk, and has a great eagerness to make contact with people who will let him. So if you have any difficulty understanding what he is saying, just tell me and I'll make it clear. 
CARR Speaking is one thing, Treves, but can the man comprehend? 
Treves cannot easily answer this question. 
TREVES ...As I said, it's only a physical problem... but I do feel that Mr. Merrick is very flattered that you're taking the time and trouble to meet him, and he's most anxious to make a good impression, so he might seem rather nervous. 
CARR He needn't. I have no desire to cause him any discomfort. Did you make those inquiries we spoke about? 
TREVES Yes, I spoke to both the British Home and Royal Hospital for Incurables. I'm afraid that they weren't very encouraging, but they said they'd bring it up at their next committee meeting, so we should have their answers shortly. 
CARR Fine, fine. You know, your dedication to this patient is an inspiring thing, Treves. But you must remember that this is a hospital, and there are many patients here. Patients who can be made well, and you owe them your first consideration. Just don't become so obsessed, old man, that you begin to neglect them. 
Carr Gomm starts up the stairs. Treves remains behind, watching him for a moment, then follows. 
ISOLATION WARD 
Merrick is standing beside his disguise on its hook. He nervously smooths the cloak down, repositions the Bible on the bedside table and smooths the cloak again. He looks at the door, expecting it to open. It doesn't. His hands smooths the cloak over and over again. Voices can be heard outside the door. 
Merrick freezes. 
There are two raps at the door. Merrick flinches, clutching the cloak. The raps are repeated. He pulls himself together and walks to the middle of the room. He takes a deep breath and closes his eyes. 
MERRICK Come in. 
The door opens and Treves and Carr Gomm enter. Carr Gomm's eyes are rivited on Merrick, but he contains his shock. 
Merrick is breathing unevenly, his eyes still closed. Treves goes to him and touches his shoulder. Merrick opens his eyes and looks up at Treves. Treves turns to Carr Gomm, as does Merrick. Carr Gomm lowers his eyes. 
TREVES John, may I introduce you to Sir Carr Gomm. 
MERRICK Hello... my name is John Merrick. I am very pleased to meet you. 
Carr Gomm, still shaken, instinctively offers his hand. 
CARR I'm very... pleased to meet you. 
Before Carr Gomm can withdraw his hand, Merrick grasps it with his left hand. 
There is an uncomfortable silence. Merrick releases it. Carr Gomn, nervously clears his throat.

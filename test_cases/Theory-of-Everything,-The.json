{"train": "THE THEORY OF EVERYTHING \nWritten by \nAnthony McCarten \nSHOOTING SCRIPT NOVEMBER 2013 \n\"I now predict that I was wrong.\" STEPHEN HAWKING \nRUN OPENING TITLES OVER: \nINT. EMPIRE ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY (LATE 1980'S) \nTWO BESPECTACLED EYES. Blinking. Alert. Male. Middle-aged. Reflected in his shiny GLASSES - a WOMAN, middle-aged, (JANE HAWKING) removing the glasses from his nose. \nCUT TO: \nThe MAN's POV, as - \n- his vision goes from FOCUSED to BLURRY as the GLASSES are removed. \n- his BLURRY POV of the WOMAN's hands POLISHING his glasses with a cloth. \n- his BLURRY POV then shifts (as she steps aside) onto a SMALL PERSON in the distance jumping up and down. \n- his BLURRY POV of the GLASSES then being replaced on his nose, and - \n- with this, his VISION comes abruptly into FOCUS, and the SMALL PERSON is revealed to be -- a BOY (10) playing HOPSCOTCH in the RED-CARPETED CORRIDOR. \n- Beyond the BOY, TWO RED-COATED EQUERRIES begin (unceremoniously) to prepare the HALLWAY for a ceremony. They lay out potted-plants and drape velvet ropes. One blows his nose. \nTIGHT ON: The eyes behind the glasses watching, his eyes finally looking downward...as we hear a metallic CLICKING sound - \"CLICK, CLICK, CLICK...\" \n- ANGLE ON: HIS HAND, which is clicking a CLICKER-PLATE... \n- then on a COMPUTER MONITOR (mounted to the CHAIR), words form out of a streaming alphabet with each 'CLICK'. The man is at work, selecting LETTERS, then WHOLE WORDS from a MENU ...making sentences by these means. \n- OTHER PARTIAL VIEWS (ECUs) of this MAN in his WHEELCHAIR. \nWe see...a TUFT of BROWN HAIR...his HAND on chair arm-rest ...his FEET on a wheelchair's foot-rests...JANE's HANDS arrange the BROWN HAIR...adjust his THIN ARMS...but never do we see the full man, as - \n- the TWO EQUERRIES open TWO LARGE ORNATE DOORS and motion the PARTY forward. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING      2 \nCONTINUED: \nTIGHT ON: the MAN's HAND, pushing a TOGGLE-STICK CONTROLLER, putting the CHAIR in motion, to the sound of a small electric motor. \nEND OPENING TITLES - \nTIGHT ON: The WHEELS of the WHEELCHAIR, turning... \nMATCH CUT TO: \nEXT. CAMBRIDGE STREETS - DAY (EARLY-MID 1960's) \n...the FRONT WHEEL of STEPHEN's BICYCLE, SPINNING VERY VERY FAST... \nSTEPHEN HAWKING (in his early 20s) and his friend, BRIAN (same age), race each other recklessly through the NARROW, WINDING LANES. It looks VERY DANGEROUS. They are neck and neck. And they are loving it. \nSTEPHEN HAWKING, his face almost entirely covered with spectacles and floppy hair, slight of frame, a velvet jacket and velvet bow tie, eccentric-looking. STEPHEN is a fun- loving, playful, active, young student. \nBRIAN, STEPHEN's best friend. More interested in life than studies, as we shall see. \nEXT. STUDENT PARTY,CAMBRIDGE - DUSK \nSTEPHEN and BRIAN arrive at the party, dismount at speed and, running to a walk, crash their BIKES into a HEDGE. BRIAN wins the race, raises arms aloft as - they enter the PARTY. We follow them in...(CONTINUOUS SHOT) \nINT. STUDENT PARTY,CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT - CONTINUOUS \n...STEPHEN and BRIAN enter, and the CAMERA finally follows them into the main room of the PARTY. \nSTEPHEN and BRIAN come to a halt in the doorway as they OBSERVE - \n- a CROWDED ROOM engaged in lively bubbly conversation. In the background suitably elegant music plays. \nBRIAN First to find a drink. \nBRIAN walks off to talk to another GIRL, while - \n- STEPHEN, left alone, decides to slowly approach JANE. JANE has hardly touched her wine. STEPHEN has a beer. \nThey look around the room together, and then - \nSTEPHEN Hello. \nJANE Hello. \nSTEPHEN Science? \nJANE Arts. \nMore silence. They look elsewhere. \nJANE (CONT'D) So what do you-? \nSTEPHEN Cosmologist. I'm a cosmologist. \nJANE What's a cosmologist? \nSTEPHEN It's a kind of religion--for intelligent atheists. (SUSPICIOUSLY) You're not religious, are you? \nJANE C of E. Church of England. \nSTEPHEN (SIMULTANEOUSLY) - England. (SMILES CHEEKILY) I suppose someone has to be. \nJANE is not sure whether to take offence. \nJANE So--what do cosmologists worship then? \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING       6 \nCONTINUED: (4) \nSTEPHEN (GRINS) A single unifying equation that explains everything in the universe. \nJANE (AMUSED) Really? So what's the equation? \nSTEPHEN smiles. \nSTEPHEN That is the question. \nCUT TO: \nThe NEEDLE on the RECORD PLAYER now drops onto a ROLLING STONES record - \"TIME IS ON OUR SIDE\" \nFew people remain at the party now. The tables are empty - the food is gone. The punch bowl is drained dry. \nDIANA is still talking to DAVID, laughing. \nANGLE ON: JANE, now listening intently to STEPHEN. \nJANE Why didn't you stay at Oxford? \nSTEPHEN My finals papers were such a shambles the examiners called me in for a 'Viva' and I told them - \nJANE What's a viva? \nSTEPHEN A mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy. An interrogation. So I told them that if they gave me a 2nd class degree I'd stay with them and do my research at Oxford, but if they gave me the 1st I needed to get into Cambridge, then they'd never have to see me again. \nJANE They gave you the 1st. \nSTEPHEN They gave me the 1st. \nJANE laughs. STEPHEN grins - it's a GREAT GRIN, as - \n- DIANA approaches. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   7 \nCONTINUED: (5) \nDIANA This party is officially deceased! Come on--I've fixed you up a ride home. \nDAVID and DAVID's HANDSOME FRIEND wait by the door. JANE barely has time to speak before she is dragged away by DIANA. \nJANE Well, I hope you find your equation. \nThe PhD STUDENTS are gathered, minus STEPHEN as SCIAMA hands back the classes answers. \nSCIAMA (PASSING PAPER) John, this so illegible I'm not quite sure how wrong it is--I suspect very--and Brian... (TOSSING PAPERS) ...that's just--baffling. \nSTEPHEN arrives late - \nSCIAMA (CONT'D) Stephen, glad you could join us. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   10 \nCONTINUED: \nSTEPHEN Sorry. \nSTEPHEN sets TWO TRAIN TIMETABLES on the table. Others push the TIME-TABLES down the desk to SCIAMA, who picks them up. \nSCIAMA Train timetables? Stephen, these are totally unacceptable--they expired a month ago. \nLaughter. \nSTEPHEN Sorry. It's on the back. Had a little accident. \nSCIAMA turns them over and looks at them. \nTIGHT ON: the TIMETABLES, then are filled with tiny formulas and calculations. \nSCIAMA registers growing amazement, then looks up at STEPHEN - \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) I could only do nine. \nEnd on SCIAMA and fellow students reaction - startled, speechless, everyone staring at STEPHEN. \nSCIAMA Well...I see...well thank God. Well done Stephen. \nBRIAN (SILENTLY MOUTHS) Nine? \nEXT. RIVER - DAY \nOARS powerfully cut the WATER as a TWO-BOAT PRACTICE RACE unfolds. The TWO CREWS are from the same CLUB. \nPAN DOWN one BOAT: EIGHT LARGE POWERFUL ROWERS, culminating in PETE, DAN, RAFF, BRIAN and finally the thin, boyish, STEPHEN, in the role of COX, facing the rowers, calling out the stroke-rate using a coxswain's loud-hailer. \nSTEPHEN Full, give me twenty - One, drive! - Two, drive! - Three, big legs! - Four, press! - Five, boom! - Hook, send! - Catch, big send! - Hold at 32! - Big legs, Brian! - Big legs! (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   11 \nCONTINUED: STEPHEN (CONT'D) - Stay long, Brian! - Stay long Brian!!!... \nBRIAN (exhausted, speaks one word on each stroke) You! - complete! - and! - utter! bastard! \nINT. PUB ON RIVER - DAY \nRowdy tables of graduates and undergraduates and rowers, males and females. Beer flows. \nPlaying PINBALL are BRIAN, REES, ELLIS and CARTER. STEPHEN watches, drinking a beer, distracted. \nCARTER No, no, listen, listen, pay attention. A man enters a lift, wanting to go to the fiftieth floor but only gets as far as the 46th. Why? \nBRIAN (EXHAUSTED) Erm - there was a naked girl in the lift. \nCollective groan. BRIAN is clipped around the ears. \nBRIAN (CONT'D) Hey--it's the closest I'll get to a unifying theory, leave me alone. \nALL then silently ponder the RIDDLE. BRIAN, deep in thought himself, finally notices STEPHEN, bursting to provide the answer. BRIAN acts to SILENCE STEPHEN - \nBRIAN (CONT'D) (raising a finger) Uh!!! \nELLIS No--we give up. No idea. \nSTEPHEN He was too short to reach the button for the fiftieth floor. \nSTEPHEN rises, triumphant, as the others groan. \nBRIAN Okay, I've got one. Okay, okay-- A naked girl enters a lift - \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   12 \nCONTINUED: \nSCIAMA Come with me. \nINT. CAVENDISH LAB, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY \nSCIAMA shows STEPHEN the famous lab. \nSCIAMA This lab is where JJ Thomson discovered the electron, where Rutherford split the atom. One of the great rewards of this job is that you never know from where the next great leap forward is going to come, or from whom. \nSCIAMA takes out a pen and writes on a pad, tears it off and gives it to STEPHEN. \nSCIAMA (CONT'D) Next Friday. I'm taking a few graduates of merit to London, to attend a talk by the mathematician Roger Penrose. Come along if you're interested. (EXITING) Oh, and close the door as you leave. \nSCIAMA exits. STEPHEN looks around at the empty LAB. He goes to the BLACKBOARD, picks up a piece of CHALK, looks at the BLANK BOARD, but then puts the CHALK back down and then begins to study, with RAPT AWE, the ancient LABORATORY EQUIPMENT. \nEXT. ANGLICAN CHURCH STEPS - DAY \nSTEPHEN is now sitting on a STONE WALL, waiting as - \n- the WILDES emerge, in the SUNDAY FINERY. JANE peels off from her family to talk to STEPHEN. She is pleased to see him. \nJANE So I gather you've never been to church? \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   15 \nCONTINUED: \nSTEPHEN Once upon a time. \nHe smiles wryly at this Fairy Tale reference. \nJANE Tempted to convert? \nHe thinks about this. \nSTEPHEN I have a problem with the whole Celestial Dictator premise. What are you doing for lunch? Ma makes a cracking roast. \nINT. DINING ROOM, HAWKING FAMILY HOME - DAY \nSunday family lunch. A noisy, eccentric, bohemian atmosphere. STEPHEN's father, FRANK opens his HOME-MADE WINE. His sister PHILIPPA (17) passes the plates. MARY (20) reads a BOOK. \nFRANK HAWKING And Jane? What are you studying? \nJANE Arts. Languages, poetry. I'm thinking of doing a PhD eventually. \nFRANK HAWKING Oh? What in? \nThe HAWKINGS, impressed, nod approvingly at STEPHEN. \nJANE (ENCOURAGED) Medieval poetry of the Iberian Peninsula. \nPHILIPPA snorts back laughter, whilst the other HAWKINGS stare blankly at JANE for a moment, before silently returning to setting the table. FRANK rescues the mood - \nFRANK HAWKING Arts. So, what painters do you like? \nJANE Well, I like--Turner... \nFRANK HAWKING Really? Turner? To me they all look as if they've been left out in the rain. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   16 \nCONTINUED: \nSTEPHEN laughs. JANE shoots him a surprised look, as FRANK pours a glass of wine. \nJANE And...William Blake. \nPHILLIPA Good heavens. Surely not! \nFRANK HAWKING (TO JANE) Will you try my elderflower wine? \nJANE Yes, please. \nSTEPHEN (TO JANE) Don't touch it, don't touch it Jane. \nEnter ISOBEL, STEPHEN's mother, with a ROAST CHICKEN. \nAs FRANK passes wine, JANE looks nervously at STEPHEN, who smiles at her. FRANK picks up the CARVING KNIFE and starts to SHARPEN it. \nFRANK HAWKING Stephen doesn't like my homemade wine. Philistine. (TO STEPHEN) If you don't watch out I'll send you back with a couple of bottles. \nSTEPHEN Oh, no, no. Happy to observe the phenomenon--but I can't possibly imagine participating. \nJANE I absolutely agree. I mean, who would want to dance? \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   19 \nCONTINUED: \nSTEPHEN No, I'm quite serious. I don't dance. \nJANE has a wistful look of disappointment. AWKWARD SILENCE. \nJust then - A BLUE UV LIGHT comes on. This causes great excitement on the dance-floor. All the other couples \"ooh\" and \"ahh\" and even more people take to the floor - not so, STEPHEN and JANE. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) (SOFTLY) Do you see how the men's cuffs and shirt-fronts, how they glow more than the dresses? \nJANE (smiles, expectant) Yes... \nSTEPHEN Do you know why? \nJANE Why? \nSTEPHEN \"TIDE.\" \nJANE The washing powder? \nSTEPHEN The fluorescence in the washing powder is caught by the UV light. \nJANE Why do you know that? \nSTEPHEN (GRINS) When stars are born and when they die, they emit UV radiation. So if we could see the night sky in ultraviolet light, almost all the stars would disappear--and all we'd see would be these spectacular births and deaths. And I reckon-- it would look a little - \nJANE stares at the glowing swirling people with STEPHEN's eyes. \nJANE - like that. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   20 \nCONTINUED: (2) \nThey watch, impressed, as - FIREWORKS are suddenly heard, EXPLODING LOUDLY. \nEXT. TERRACE/LAWNS/RIVERBANK - G&C COLLEGE - NIGHT (1963) \nMONTAGE: \nA) A FIRE-WORK DISPLAY - STEPHEN and JANE watch as SKY- ROCKETS light up the sky. \nB) A CAROUSEL - JANE and STEPHEN ride the CAROUSEL. STEPHEN watches JANE, captivated by her happiness in this moment. \nC) A CHAMPAGNE TENT - JANE selects a FLUTE OF CHAMPAGNE and takes a BIG SIP, to the sound of a NEARBY 1920's CHICAGO JAZZ SWING band. The GATSBY-THEMED BAR-STAFF are dressed in 1920's TUXEDOS and FLAPPER-DRESSES. \nSTEPHEN So why... (PASSING CHAMPAGNE) ...why... \nJANE Why? \nSTEPHEN Why medieval Spanish poetry? \nJANE surveys the gay party, sipping her champagne - \nJANE (HAPPILY) I suppose I like to time travel. \nSTEPHEN And what particular time periods do you visit? \nJANE takes the CHAMPAGNE STEPHEN has just chosen and pours half of his into her glass. \nJANE The Twenties is always fun. \nSTEPHEN The roaring twenties! Cheers! \nThey CLINK GLASSES and sip their champagne, laughing. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) So--The 1920's. A good time for poetry was it? \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   21 \nCONTINUED: \nJANE \"Seek then/ No learning/ from Starry Men!/ Who follow with Optic Glass/ The Whirling Ways of Stars that Pass.\" \nROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) The star, in fact, gets denser as atoms--even subatomic particles-- get literally crushed, smashed into smaller and smaller space. And at its end point what are we left with? \nHe draws a point. \nROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) A point. A spacetime singularity... \nSTEPHEN is captivated. \nROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) With extraordinary properties! Infinite density. Space and time come to a stop. All of the known laws of science--they just stop working. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   24 \nCONTINUED: (2) ROGER PENROSE (CONT'D) What I've just shown is that this happens in every black hole. Its really happening, out there. To real stars--and its happening right now! \nSTEPHEN smiles - seeing his future revealed. \nINT. MOVING TRAIN COMPARTMENT - NIGHT \nSCIAMA and his students, returning home. \nAs his friends talk excitedly, STEPHEN is silently staring down at the CIRCULATING COFFEE in front of him, into which he pours CREAM... \nSLOWLY, CLOCKWISE - the cream is spread outward by the circulating coffee until it looks like a SPIRAL GALAXY. \nAs he stares, deep in thought, the SPIRAL of CREAM pulses with LIGHT - he is having an epiphany here - a major insight... \n...and then TIME GOES INTO REVERSE. As it does so, the CREAM CHANGES DIRECTION, goes ANTI-CLOCKWISE now, the SPIRAL once more returning to its original central dollop, and then vanishing. The coffee creamless. STEPHEN looks up... \nSTEPHEN (TO SCIAMA) I wonder what would happen--if--I wonder what would happen-- \nSensing his protege is on to something, perhaps even a small smile. \nSCIAMA Go on. If? \nSTEPHEN If you applied Penrose's theory about black holes to--the entire universe? \nSCIAMA stares at him. \nEXT. RIVERBANK, CAMBRIDGE - SUNSET \nSTEPHEN excitedly expands on his new idea to a DELIGHTED, SMILING JANE as they WALK side by side. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   25 \nCONTINUED: \nSTEPHEN If--if--so--If--Einstein is right, if--general relativity is correct, then the universe is expanding, yes? - \nJANE - Alright - \nSTEPHEN - which means - that--if you reverse time, the universe would get smaller and smaller. So what if--if I reverse the process all the way to see what happened at the beginning of Time itself? The universe, smaller and smaller, denser and denser, hotter and hotter as we approach its birth. Wind back the clock... \nJANE grabs his hands and begins to SWIRL him around. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) What are you doing? \nJANE Winding back the clock! \nSTEPHEN (LAUGHING) Is that what you're doing? \nJANE That's what I'm doing. \nSTEPHEN Well keep winding! You've got quite a way to go. Keep winding, Jane! Keep winding...back to the beginning of Time...Keep winding... \nThey SPIN faster and faster until they almost trip and only save themselves by clasping each other closely... \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) (SUDDENLY SERIOUS) ...until you get - \nINT. SCIAMA'S OFFICE/DAMTP, CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nSTEPHEN at the blackboard makes a DOT on the blackboard. \nSCIAMA A singularity. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   26 \nCONTINUED: \nSTEPHEN A spacetime singularity. At the beginning of time. \nREACTION: STEPHEN, devastated. Frozen. People walk past him and he doesn't move, doesn't react. \nINT. BATHROOM, TRINITY HALL - DAY \nWATER drips in SLOW MO from an old TAP. \nSTEPHEN lies in a bath, in a TRANCE, knees drawn up, hair wet, not moving, in a STATE OF SHOCK, as he stares at the DRIPPING TAP, until - \n- his eyes are drawn to his ARM where he sees a weird PHENOMENON - it's called FASCICULATION - a visible throbbing that travels underneath the skin. \nINT. COLLEGE STAIR-WELL - DAY \nBRIAN rushes up the SPIRAL STAIRS, past the \"BEDDER\" - a woman who looks after the STUDENTS domestic needs. \nBRIAN (TO BEDDER) Is he up yet? THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   29 \nINT. STEPHEN'S DORM ROOM/CAMBRIDGE UNI   - DAY (EM60'S) \nSuddenly, a pounding on his door, and then BRIAN enters STEPHEN's room. \nWAGNER is playing INCREDIBLY LOUDLY on an old TAPE-DECK. BRIAN shuts it off and looks at - \n- STEPHEN, in the corner, in his pyjamas, his MATRESS now on the floor (rather than on the HIGH BUNK as before) legs drawn up, reading a book of CHESS. \nBRIAN \"Welcome--to this week's episode of The Natural World, where we explain the extraordinary hibernation patterns of the rare Cambridge Physicist--seen here in his wonderful plumage...\" \nSilence. BRIAN waits for STEPHEN to speak. \nBRIAN (CONT'D) So? What did they say? Your wrist. What did they say? \nSTEPHEN I have a disease, Bri. \nBRIAN (WHISPERS) Is it--venereal, Stephen? \nSTEPHEN No. Motor neuron disease. Lou Gehrig's Disease. He was a baseball player. \nBRIAN Motor what? Sorry, I'm lagging behind in my pioneering work on rare automotive and baseball diseases. Come on, let's go to the pub. \nBRIAN tries to pull STEPHEN to his feet. \nSTEPHEN (IMPASSIVELY) I have two years to live. (PAUSE) Sounds strange, doesn't it, when you say it out loud. \nBRIAN What? I--I don't understand. It's not possible! It's ridiculous! (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   30 \nCONTINUED: BRIAN (CONT'D) You were fine a couple of days ago. (SILENCE) Steve? You're fine. What did they say...? \nSTEPHEN Will you leave me Brian? \nBRIAN I'm sorry, look, I was just being a berk...I'm so... \nThe BEDDER knocks and enters. \nBEDDER Stephen! Phone for you! It's a girl. \nBRIAN has no choice. He is badly shaken by the news. \nBRIAN Right. OK. So--see you soon, yeah? \nSTEPHEN does his best to smile. Brian exits. \nBEDDER (TO STEPHEN) She's waiting. \nINT. HALLWAY, WILDE FAMILY HOME - DAY \nJANE on phone. \nJANE Stephen? Hi. It's me. (CLICK!) Stephen? \nShe holds the DEAD RECEIVER in her hand. \nEXT. TRINITY HALL, CAMBRIDGE UNIVERSITY - DAY \nThrough the swirl of UNIVERSITY life comes - JANE WILDE. \nINT. HALLWAY/STEPHEN'S DORM ROOM - DAY \nJANE knocks - gets no answer. \n- he knocks his ball and hits the finishing peg. \nJANE has been watching all this, her eyes FLOODING WITH TEARS, until she can bear it no longer, and walks up to him and picks up his ball, stopping the game. They stare into each others eyes, until he can bear it no longer and he walks off (as best he can) back to his room. \nShe watches him, then follows determinedly. \nINT. STEPHEN'S DORM ROOM/CAMBRIDGE UNI - DAY \nHe enters ANGRILY, SLAMS the door behind him, then tries to break a CHAIR by throwing it against the wall - just as JANE enters. \nSTEPHEN Go away. \nMore knocks. \nJANE (O.S.) STEPHEN? Let me in. Please. Please let me in. \nINT. HALLWAY/STEPHEN'S DORM/CAMBRIDGE UNI - DAY \nSTEPHEN (O.S.) Go away! \nJANE Are you going to talk about this or not? \nSilence. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   34 \nCONTINUED: \nSTEPHEN There's nothing to say-- just...(go) \nJANE Is that what you want? \nSTEPHEN That's what I want. I haven't got time for you. So - if you care about me at all - go. \nJANE moves closer and closer to STEPHEN during this whole interchange - almost trapping STEPHEN, who is gallantly trying to resist being taken into her life. \nJANE I can't. \nSTEPHEN I've got two years. I need to work. \nJANE I can't. \nHis eyes widen. He can't believe his ears. He looks at her. \nJANE (CONT'D) I think--I've fallen in love with you. \nHe can't speak now. This STUNS him. \nJANE (CONT'D) I know. Strange. Inexplicable. \nSTEPHEN You've--you've leapt to--a false conclusion... \nJANE My chances are probably - (SHRUGS) - well, some \"integer of zero\", but I think we can make a go of this. I want us to be together, for as long as we've got. And if that's not very long then - well, that's just how it is. It will have to do. \nSTEPHEN You don't realise what's coming. It'll affect everything. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   35 \nCONTINUED: (2) \nShe advances, and kisses him on the lips. He is still speechless. She stares into his eyes, with love -- \nJANE Your glasses are always dirty. \nShe takes them off, cleans them on her dress. His heart is exploding with joy and hope. She slips his GLASSES gently back on his nose. \nJANE (CONT'D) There. That's better. Isn't it? \nSTEPHEN (POWERFULLY MOVED) Yes. It is. \nINT. SCIAMA'S OFFICE, DAMTP/CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nSCIAMA is giving a TUTORIAL to FOUR UNDERGRADS - \nSCIAMA ...the solutions to the Schrodinger equation must vanish at the boundary of the box, so we have... \nSTEPHEN enters - \nSTEPHEN (cutting him off) Time! \nSilence. STEPHEN waits, as the PANEL turn the pages of his thesis. STEPHEN grows WORRIED. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   38 \nCONTINUED: \nSCIAMA (CONT'D) A black hole at the beginning of Time. \nKIP THORNE A spacetime singularity? \nSCIAMA and PENROSE and KIP THORNE look at each other. STEPHEN can't breath for the tension. \nSCIAMA Brilliant. It's brilliant Stephen. So all that remains to be said is...well done. Or should I say, well done Doctor. And extraordinary theory. \nSTEPHEN Thankyou. \nSTEPHEN sighs with RELIEF, and smiles. \nSCIAMA So, what now? \nSTEPHEN Prove it. Prove...with a single equation, that Time has a beginning. Wouldn't that be nice Professor? One single elegant equation to explain everything? \nSCIAMA Yes. It would. It would indeed. \nINT. LOUNGE, LITTLE ST MARY'S LANE - EVENING \nCHAMPAGNE is OPENED and POURED. \nA celebrational dinner party, attended by JANE, BRIAN, ELLIS, REES, CARTER and two of their GIRLFRIENDS. JANE rises to give a TOAST. \nJANE TO DOCTOR- \nBRIAN -Who? \nOver laughter - \nJANE To Doctor Stephen Hawking. \nCUT TO: \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING    39 \nCONTINUED: \nBRIAN holds forth on a funny story about him and Stephen, as he uncorks a bottle of wine - \nBRIAN What's astonishing is that for Stephen and I, \"work\" was the worst four-letter word, the worst. (LAUGHTER) Stephen probably averaged, what was it?--an hour a day your entire university career? (LAUGHTER) Unbelievable levels of sloth! \nAs the conversation turns into a HUBBUB of chatter, STEPHEN, smiling, drops his FORK. JANE, in conversation now with one of the GIRLFRIENDS, picks up the fork without barely looking at STEPHEN and put it back in front of him. \nSTEPHEN watches everybody      talking, eating, drinking, being wonderfully, effortlessly      dextrous. FRUSTRATED, ENVIOUS, and saddened, STEPHEN watches      closely then, before emotion breaks through, rises, grabs his      TWO WALKING STICKS and starts to leave. \nJANE (CONCERNED) Stephen? \nSTEPHEN I'm sorry. \nEveryone watches him go with concern. It's a painful sight to see how hard it is for him to walk now. \nWhen he is gone only a few seconds, the guests stop their chatter when they hear a huge THUMP. Several men are about to rise to his aid when JANE signals for everyone to remain in their place. Everyone understands and settles again. \nINT. HALL, LITTLE ST MARY'S LANE - EVENING \nSTEPHEN tries to pull himself up the stairs by the spokes of the balustrade. It takes him many seconds just to get up the first stairs but we see his determination. \nINT. LOUNGE, LITTLE ST MARY'S LANE - EVENING \nThe DINNER guests are now eating DESSERT, and talking quietly. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   40 \nINT. HALL, LITTLE ST MARY'S LANE - NIGHT \nSTEPHEN is only halfway up the STAIRS, using his last heroic energies. Finally, he STOPS, EXHAUSTED. Hearing something, he looks up - \nThe TWO YEAR-OLD ROBERT has woken, and stands in his pajamas at the BABY-GATE at the top of the stairs, looking down at his father. \nSTEPHEN It's okay Robert. \nFor the first time - with his head resting on the step, and with his eyes turning back to look through the balusters at the REFLECTION in a DINING ROOM mirror of the dinner party (his POV: tilted at 90 degrees) TEARS fall out of his eyes. A PRIVATE MOMENT of great despair. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nKIP THORNE What is it? \nSCIAMA Stephen! He's changed everything! \nSCIAMA runs on, informing a mopping JANITOR - \nSCIAMA (CONT'D) (TO JANITOR) Black Holes aren't black! And they explode! (RUNNING OFF) They explode!!... \nREACTION: KIP THORNE, confusion. \nINT. LOBBY, RUTHERFORD LAB - DAY \nSTEPHEN is about to present his ideas to the conference. He is SURROUNDED by his PEERS. \nSCIAMA All set? \nSTEPHEN nods - nervous. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   43 \nCONTINUED: \nSCIAMA (CONT'D) You'll do fine. \nAT A DISTANCE - at a TEA TABLE - excluded, and looking EXHAUSTED after a LONG NIGHT - JANE sits near TWO CLEANERS IN WHITE, and overhears the female gossip about STEPHEN's condition. \nCHAR 1 Look at him. It's awful, in't it? He's falling apart at the seams. \nJANE reacts, says nothing but bites her lips and frowns indignantly, as the CLEANERS walk away. \nJANE then approaches STEPHEN, nervously. But when he looks up at her, his EYES are BLAZING WITH LIGHT and passion - this pulls her out of her SADNESS. \nJANE (LOVINGLY) Good luck! \nHe SMILES back at her, as the ENTRY DOORS to the HALL open, and REVEAL a PACKED EXPECTANT ROOM. It's daunting! \nSCIAMA Ready or not. \nSCIAMA PUSHES STEPHEN into the HALL, as - \n- JANE hurries to gather STEPHEN's NOTES, his WATER-BOTTLE, his BLANKET and her HANDBAG, only just slipping through the CLOSING DOORS. \nINT. LECTURE HALL/RUTHERFORD LAB/CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nBefore his peers, STEPHEN finishes his address. SCIAMA sits with JOHN TAYLOR in the front row. JANE sits toward the BACK. \nSTEPHEN (SLURRING SLIGHTLY) ...allowing us to predict that some particles can in fact escape a black hole. Black holes aren't black at all, but glow with heat radiation. \nStony, sceptical faces greet this outrageous idea. As STEPHEN continues his speech, ANGLE ON SCIAMA and TAYLOR. \nSCIAMA (aside, to TAYLOR) He's unifying Relativity--plus Quantum Mechanics and Thermodynamics. For the first time. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   44 \nCONTINUED: \nJOHN TAYLOR (shakes head, to SCIAMA) Thermodynamics? Last used to describe the steam engine. \nDuring this exchange (O.S) STEPHEN has been saying: \nSTEPHEN In other words--the steady emission of heat energy causes black holes to slowly lose mass, they evaporate, eventually disappearing in a spectacular explosion. So... \nINTERCUT THIS LECTURE SCENE (as necessary) with the FOLLOWING SCENE: \nINT. PUB ON RIVER, CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT \nBRIAN and REES, CARTER and ELLIS discuss STEPHEN's theory. \nBRIAN No,no! What he's saying is--just as a hot body loses heat--right? - \nREES Second law of thermodynamics. \nBRIAN - that a black hole - \nBRIAN dips a finger in the FROTH of REES's BEER and draws a CIRCLE on the TABLETOP. \nREES - thanks - \nBRIAN - that if it is losing particles, then, then over time - \nBRIAN BASTARDS! \nBRIAN lifts STEPHEN out of his chair. He's heavy. \nBRIAN (CONT'D) Jeez!--uhhhh!--how the hell does Jane manage? \nHe starts to carry STEPHEN up...up...up... \nSTEPHEN Big legs! Big legs Brian! \nBRIAN So, tell me, this Motor Neuron Disease, does it effect, y'know... \nSTEPHEN What? \nBRIAN Everything..? \nBRIAN indicates 'down there'. \nSTEPHEN Different system. Automatic. \nBRIAN That's kinda wonderful, actually. And it explains a great deal about men. \nBRIAN and STEPHEN then disappears over the top of the STEPS. After a few beats BRIAN reappears and runs down the steps to reclaim the wheelchair. He picks it up and starts up the steps with it. \nCUT TO: \nSTEPHEN, cradled in the giant arms of a seated MARBLE STATUE!!! (maybe Queen Victoria) - cradled like a baby, waiting for BRIAN to return. \nINT. UNIVERSITY BOOKSHOP - DAY \nThe SHELVES are being restocked. The latest issue of \"NATURE\" MAGAZINE is set on the stand by a STOCKIST. The COVER reads: \n\"HAWKING RADIATION\" \nTHE THEORY of EVERYTHING   48 \nEXT. WEST ROAD FLAT, CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nCLOSE ON: STEPHEN. Waiting in his WHEELCHAIR on the front LAWN. About 8 YEARS have passed since we last saw him. His physical deterioration is marked. His body is thinner and powerless. His legs are bent and his face is slightly asymmetric. \nWIDE: Beside him is STACKED a mountain of FAMILY HOLIDAY LUGGAGE (umbrellas, beach balls, plastic cricket set, tent etc.) \nIn the Background, the NEW WEST ROAD FLAT - a LARGE VICTORIAN HOUSE. The sign in front reads \"GONVILLE and CAIUS COLLEGE\". \nOn the LAWN the children (ROBERT, now 9 - and LUCY, now 5) PLAY with BEACH TOYS, until - \n- JANE (with a new haircut and fashion befitting the LATE 1970's) yells - \nJANE Get in the car! Get! In! The Car! Come on! Let's go see Gran and Grandad! \nThe CHILDREN obey, and jump into the now OLD MINI parked at the kerb, as - \n- JANE confronts the MOUNTAIN OF STUFF, including STEPHEN, that must somehow be stowed. No way. \nLATER - back and forth JANE goes between LUGGAGE and MINI. STEPHEN can only watch her load the stuff into the car and onto the ROOF-RACK. Finally - REVEAL the LOADED MINI - it looks ridiculously burdened! \nJANE takes a deep, exhausted, breath, then turns back for STEPHEN. He sits there in his wheelchair, looking at her... \nROBERT and JANE together, with GREAT DIFFICULTY, get STEPHEN into the front seat and shut the door. ROBERT struggles to COLLAPSE the WHEELCHAIR, until JANE comes and together they muscle it onto the ROOF-RACK. \nEXT. WELSH COTTAGE - WALES - DAY \nFRANK & ISOBEL HAWKING's tumble-down WELSH COTTAGE high above on a STEEP HILLSIDE, only reached by an ENORMOUS FLIGHT of STEPS. \nREACTION JANE: Exasperation! \nISOBEL descends to greet them, followed by FRANK. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   49 \nCONTINUED: \nISOBEL Isn't it marvellous? We can rent it every year! \nJANE Yes. I see. But what about all the steps, Frank? \nFRANK HAWKING Oh, it's nothing. The climb is absolutely worth it. You get the luggage. \nFRANK backs STEPHEN (in his wheelchair) up the STEPS, one at a time, while ISOBEL runs up ahead with the CHILDREN, leaving JANE, alone, with ALL THE LUGGAGE. \nSTEPHEN (SLURRING) Yes, a magazine subscription. \nSCIAMA Why would you bet against yourself? (PAUSE) (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   52 \nCONTINUED: SCIAMA (CONT'D) A subscription to what? Nature magazine? \nSTEPHEN Pent-house. That way even if I'm wrong, I still win! \nSCIAMA laughs heartily as - \n- STEPHEN grins, at the same time SPYING - up ahead, TWO ATTRACTIVE UNDER-GRADUATE GIRLS about to enter the LIFT. \nSTEPHEN hits the GAS! - and SPEEDS toward the LIFT... \nSCIAMA Penthouse? \nSTEPHEN SPEEDS toward the LIFT, whose DOORS ARE READY TO CLOSE. \nSCIAMA winces in expectation of a horrible accident. \nWIDE: it looks suicidal but the chair just flies through the GAP in the last split second before the DOORS CLOSE - the doors shaving the wheels, with a small spark. \nINT. LIFT, DAMTP, G&C COLLEGE - DAY \nSTEPHEN, in there with the TWO UNDERGRADUATE GIRLS, SMILES at them. \nINT. LIVING ROOM,WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nJANE picks up pieces of a BROKEN POTTED PLANT, dirt spilled over the carpet, then violently VACUUMES as BERYL comes in with a tea-tray. \nBERYL Jane--Jane? Jane? Jane! STOP! \nJANE keeps VACUUMING. BERYL pulls the PLUG on the VACUUM CLEANER. JANE stares at her Mum. \nBERYL (CONT'D) Sit down. Sit. \nBERYL pours TEA for the exhausted JANE. JANE sits. \nBERYL (CONT'D) Now--I'd like to make a suggestion-- it might sound unusual--but I've seen it work wonders. I think--you should consider - (BEAT) - joining the church choir. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   53 \nCONTINUED: \nREACTION JANE: Momentarily SPEECHLESS - \nJANE Mum--I think that is possibly the most English thing anyone has ever said. \nBERYL Maybe so. \nJANE I used to love singing. \nBERYL You're very good at it. \nJANE I don't know about that. \nBERYL Go. (pause) It's one hour a week. \nThey sip tea in silence. \nINT. CHURCH - EVENING (LATE 70'S-M80'S) \nJANE walks in - and up the AISLE - as we hear CHORAL MUSIC. \nJANE takes a pew, and then her eyes widen slightly as she recognizes the CHOIR MASTER. It's the BEARDED MAN from the supermarket car-park. She studies him, as he gently instructs and then conducts the CHOIR. \nCUT TO: \nAfter the rehearsal, the CHOIR file past JANE. JONATHAN recognizes her at once. \nJONATHAN Oh, hello. \nJANE Hello. \nJONATHAN Are you here to sing? \nJANE I um--I just came to-- \nJANE Well, that's a long story. 'Night. \nEXT. WEST ROAD FLAT, CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nSTEPHEN motors down the street, fast, and swings up the ramp in front of the door. He BANGS into the front door. \nThen waits. He hears PIANO music - a lesson in progress. \nINT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nAs STEPHEN and JANE watch - JONATHAN gives ROBERT (11) a piano lesson. \nJANE smiles at STEPHEN, who remains cautious. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   57 \nINT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT \nJONATHAN is eating dinner with JANE and STEPHEN. JANE feeds STEPHEN a forkful of food. STEPHEN chews slowly. \nSTEPHEN sneaks glances at JONATHAN. \nJONATHAN shoots a SMILE at JANE. She smiles back in return. STEPHEN catches sight of both these smiles, and sees the GROWING INTIMACY. \nJANE Water. \nShe exits. JONATHAN smiles at STEPHEN who is staring back at him. \nJONATHAN (TO STEPHEN) So - Stephen. Er - Jane tells me... \nJONATHAN picks up STEPHEN's fork, spears a cube of steak. \nJONATHAN (CONT'D) ...you have a beautiful theorem that proves that... \nJONATHAN offers up the steak, but STEPHEN's glare makes him aware this isn't welcome. He lowers the fork again. \nJONATHAN (CONT'D) ...that--that the universe had a beginning? \nJANE returns with the a JUG OF WATER and GLASSES on a TRAY. \nSTEPHEN (testily, his slurring not easily understood) That was my - PhD thesis. \nJONATHAN looks to JANE for a translation. \nJONATHAN Your...? \nJANE PhD thesis. \nSTEPHEN My new project - disproves it. \nJONATHAN Disproves it? Really? (as JANE nods) (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   58 \nCONTINUED: JONATHAN (CONT'D) You no longer believe in the Creation? \nSTEPHEN What one believes - - is irrelevant--in physics. \nJANE                             JONATHAN ...is irrelevant                   ...is irrelevant \nJANE ...in physics. \nJONATHAN looks to JANE, hoping he has not caused offence. \nJONATHAN Oh, is that so? \nJANE (ANNOYANCE SHOWING) Stephen's done a U-turn. The big new idea is that the universe has no boundaries at all. No boundaries, no beginning. No BEGINNING - \nJONATHAN - no God? Really? (TO STEPHEN) Fascinating. Because I'd understood you'd proven the need for a Creator. My mistake. \nSTEPHEN No. Mine. \nJONATHAN (UNDERSTANDING THIS) Yours. Your mistake? \nJONATHAN is surprised by this sharp reply. (He also sees that this matter is a CAUSE OF DIVISION between JANE and STEPHEN.) \nJANE Stephen is looking for a single law that governs all the forces in the universe. So God must die. \nJONATHAN Why must God die? I don't see. \nSTEPHEN doesn't react, so JANE spears a PEA on her FORK, then picks up a SECOND FORK and spears a LARGE BOILED POTATO with the other. \nEXT. GARDEN/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT \nUnder a STARRY sky - JONATHAN helps STEPHEN sip his coffee. STEPHEN accepts this now. \nJONATHAN It was leukaemia. Coming up on a year ago. She fought it, I nursed her, but in the end... Music is my salvation. Teaching and playing. I've struggled with loneliness, of course. Tyranny of the empty room, all that. Music is a consolation, although my career... Well, I'm not very ambitious. (SMILES) Is that a sin? \nSTEPHEN Wrong guy to ask. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   62 \nINT. HALLWAY, WEST ROAD FLAT, CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT \nJONATHAN puts on his JACKET to go - JANE and STEPHEN see him off. \nJANE Thank you for coming. \nJONATHAN No. Thank you. It was wonderful. (starts to go, then stops) And if--if there was anything I can do. To be of service. To you, your family. I have no children, no commitments. If I could help you, I believe I would find a purpose that would alleviate my own situation. It would be a privilege. \nSTEPHEN looks to JANE for her reaction. JANE senses EMOTIONAL DANGER and, frightened, merely smiles. \nJONATHAN (CONT'D) Night then. \nHe exits. JANE shuts the door. \nINT. MASTER BED./WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT \nJANE puts PILLOWS behind STEPHEN, who now sleeps almost upright in bed. She then takes off her BATHROBE and gets into bed herself. \nSTEPHEN I understand you need more help. And if there is - someone - who is prepared to offer it - I won't object, as long - as long as you continue to love me. \nJANE Of course. For infinity. \nBeside him in bed, she kisses his cheek and then lays her head on his frail chest. \nMUSIC UP: BACH PRELUDE, as played by JONATHAN on PIANO, over - \nMONTAGE: \nA)   (MOVED TO: POSITION \"G\" in MONTAGE) \nA1) The CAM RIVER. A PUNT on a SUNNY DAY drifts under the BRIDGE OF SIGHS - in the front of the PUNT, JANE cradles STEPHEN and ROBERT and LUCY. JANE smiles at - \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   63 \nCONTINUED: \n- JONATHAN, who is POLING them. He smiles back at her. \nB) HAWKING FRONT ROOM. JONATHAN plays the BACH PRELUDE divinely on JANE's PIANO, as - JANE, BESIDE HIM on the piano stool, turns the pages. STEPHEN watches without jealousy and with enjoyment. \nC) HAWKING BATHROOM. JONATHAN takes STEPHEN to the TOILET. \nD) When JONATHAN and JANE pass each other in the KITCHEN, and JONATHAN quite naturally takes her hand. JANE, surprised, looks at him. He SMILES at her. Their FIRST TOUCH! \nWe can see that the temptation to act further on their feelings is now HUGE for both of them, but they do nothing. JANE forces herself to break away, hurries into the next room to be with STEPHEN, the kids and a train set. JONATHAN is left to deal with his feelings. He sighs, sublimates them, then returns to his domestics. \nE) BRANCASTER BEACH. SUPER-8 FOOTAGE of their day at the beach... \nSTEPHEN's wheelchair sits on the sand at the water's edge, his trousers rolled up, water lapping his naked feet. STEPHEN helplessly watches from his wheelchair as JONATHAN engages in some playful rough and tumble with ROBERT and LUCY, kicking a FOOTBALL back and forth. JANE watches on. \nJONATHAN cradles STEPHEN as they sit there and look out to sea, both men carefree and happy, STEPHEN accepting of JONATHAN's care now. They appear as FRIENDS now. \nINT. CHURCH - NIGHT \nThe CHOIR sings a beautiful CAROL. The CAMERA finds JANE - singing nervously - the only SINGER NOT LOOKING at JONATHAN - her eyes are glued on her hymn sheet. In DENIAL. \nCUT TO: \nAfter the Rehearsal, the CHOIR leaves. JANE and JONATHAN clear up the hymn sheets. She passes her pile to him. He puts his hand on hers. She withdraws her hand. \nJANE I have to tell you something. \nJONATHAN Is anything the matter? \nShe looks at him for the first time that evening - \nJANE I'm um--I'm pregnant. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   64 \nCONTINUED: \nJONATHAN                           JANE It's - it's difficult for me!    I know, I know. \nJONATHAN                           JANE You have no -                    It's so wonderful, for me, for the children. \nJONATHAN                           JANE I have to go. I don't think I    Please, please - CAN - \nJONATHAN Perhaps the right thing is for me to just--step back. \nHe walks off. \nREACTION JANE: Distressed. \nANGLE ON: STEPHEN, at the WINDOW, watching this - CONCERNED. \nINT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nJANE does her daily NURSE chores, among these applying hand lotion quickly to STEPHEN's hands - she does this ROUTINELY. (This will contrast, later, with how Elaine applies the hand lotion.) \nSTEPHEN I've just been invited - \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   67 \nCONTINUED: \nJANE Invited? Where? \nSTEPHEN Geneva. \nJANE Geneva? \nSTEPHEN Students can accompany me. \nJANE What students? \nSTEPHEN I know how much you hate - \nJANE You know how much I hate - \nSTEPHEN - to fly. \nJANE nods, sensing they are at a crossroads. She looks away, on the verge of tears. \nJANE To fly. Yes. \nSTEPHEN I was thinking - that you and the CHILDREN - \nJANE - Me and the children--go on? \nSTEPHEN could bring the car - \nJANE - bring the car - \nSTEPHEN - meet me in Bayreuth - \nJANE Bayreuth? How can I manage that? On my own? \nSTEPHEN Bring Jonathan. \nJANE looks up at him. Her thoughts racing. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   68 \nCONTINUED: (2) \nBOTH understand the significance of this. She looks into his eyes to establish if he is sure. The look he gives her confirms this. \nJANE I doubt he would be willing. \nINT. CHURCH - NIGHT \nSTEPHEN motors up the CHURCH AISLE with TWO BOTTLES OF BEER in a PAPER BAG at his side going \"CLINK,CLINK,CLINK\". \nJONATHAN clearing up after a CHOIR PRACTICE turns - stares at STEPHEN. \nCUT TO: \nFRONT ROW of the PEWS. JONATHAN and STEPHEN, side-by-side, stare at the ALTAR. JONATHAN spots the BEER BOTTLES in STEPHEN's LAP. \nSTEPHEN Is--this okay? \nELAINE (CONT'D) A tea beginning with B? Builder's tea! Right? \nHe GRINS. She SMILES. She goes to get him some TEA. \nINT. HALLWAY/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nELAINE, smiling, enters hall (from the LIVING ROOM) and bumps into JANE, who has just arrived home with GROCERIES. They stop in front of each other. \nELAINE (CHUCKLING) I think he's the most brilliant man I've ever met. You're very lucky. \nJANE Thank you. \nELAINE You must worship the ground beneath HIS - \nJANE - wheels. \nJANE can't fail to see how enthralled ELAINE is. \nELAINE And he's the perfect patient. Looking after him is so much easier than other patients I've had. (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING    76 \nCONTINUED: ELAINE (CONT'D) And sooo funny, oh my God. When you read about him people don't tell YOU - \nJANE (cutting her off) You only do two shifts a week, Elaine. \nINT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nSTEPHEN sits in the armchair, propped up by cushions, while a TECHNICIAN bolts the NEW COMPUTER SCREEN onto STEPHEN's WHEELCHAIR. JANE watches. \nTECHNICIAN Almost there! \nJANE How does it work? \nTECHNICIAN A guy called Walt Woltosz invented the software. Uses a very simple interface that scans through the alphabet and allows each letter to be selected one by one. Using this technique, the Professor can expect to write at about four words per minute. \nELAINE enters - \nJANE (After initial dismay) Better than one a minute. \nTECHNICIAN What I've done is--use components from a telephone answering system actually-- to convert the written text into synthesized speech. The voice sounds a bit robotic, but... (IT'S READY) Okay. Shall we give it a try? \nCUT TO: \nJANE and ELAINE hoist STEPHEN into the new chair. \nTECHNICIAN (CONT'D) There we go. (GRANDLY) Welcome to the future! \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   77 \nCONTINUED: \nThe TECHNICIAN sets a pressure-sensitive 'clicker' in STEPHEN's hand. The SCREEN suddenly floods with COMPUTER CODE. REFLECTED in the glass is the WIDE-EYED FACE OF STEPHEN. \nJANE and ELAINE sit on the couch together watching - \nThe TECHNICIAN demonstrates - builds a sentence for STEPHEN, selecting one LETTER at a time. STEPHEN is all concentration, observing how it is done. \nTECHNICIAN (CONT'D) All set. Then you just click 'PLAY', like this - \nSTEPHEN looks back at the screen, then CLICKS ONCE. The COMPUTER comes to life and says STEPHEN's first words in months. \nSTEPHEN (electronic voice, strong American accent) My--name--is--Stee--ven--Hawking. \nSTEPHEN stares at JANE - incredulous. JANE stares back at STEPHEN - horrified. \nJANE It's American! Oh, my Goodness. (TO TECHNICIAN) Are there any other voices? \nTECHNICIAN That's all they have at the moment. Is that a problem? \nELAINE I think it's great! \nSTEPHEN looks bewildered. \nINT. MASTER BED./WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - NIGHT \nIn a quiet moment, STEPHEN sits alone, trying out the new device. His face shows SADNESS, BLEAKNESS. His eyes move back to the COMPUTER SCREEN. His fingers CLICK-CLICK-CLICK on the monitor. And finally we hear - his sadly moving homage (to \"2001: A Space Odyssey\"). \nSTEPHEN Daisy. Daisy. (BEAT) Give Me Your Answer Do. \nSTEPHEN I now predict -- that I was wrong. \nLAUGHTER. \nGUEST 4 Is Time Travel possible? \nLAUGHTER. \nSTEPHEN I have experimental evidence that Time Travel is not possible. I gave a party for Time-Travellers but no- one came. \nLAUGHTER. As GUEST 5 rises and starts to speak, the volume goes down on this question... \nGUEST 5 Professor Hawking, you have said you don't believe in God... \nCLOSE ON STEPHEN, slipping into a reverie as - he notices the CAP of a YOUNG LADY's PEN falls off the front lecture bench and drops to the floor...(in SLO MO). STEPHEN stares at the fallen CAP. \nANGLE ON: GUEST 5, MUTED, his mouth still moving... \nANGLE ON STEPHEN gets an idea. He wants to go and pick up that fallen CAP...Miraculously, the muscles in his slackened face start to stir...slowly his distorted expression straightens...his slumped head stirs and moves...his fingers stir...his feet ...his legs...he slowly, slowly straightens in his wheelchair, and not only this...he even begins to rise painfully out of it, at last standing on his own... Standing, he crosses the floor, picks up the fallen CAP, and holds it out the pretty YOUNG LADY. She smiles at him, not at all astonished! \nCUT TO: \nGUEST 5 - we can hear him now. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   90 \nCONTINUED: (3) \nGUEST 5 (CONT'D) You have said you do not believe in God. Do you have a philosophy of life that helps you? \nANGLE ON: STEPHEN - back in his chair, as at the start of the scene, heart-breakingly unable to do what he wishes. \nSTEPHEN It is clear that we are just an advanced breed of monkeys on a minor planet orbiting around a very average star in the outer suburb of one among a hundred billion galaxies... \nANGLE ON: The CAP on the floor, just where it had fallen. \nANGLE ON: STEPHEN, in his chair - then on MEMBERS of the AUDIENCE, being greatly stirred by the following words - \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) ...but--ever since the dawn of civilisation, people have craved for an understanding of the underlying order of the world. There ought to be something very special about the boundary conditions of the universe - and what can be more special than that there is no boundary? And there should be no boundary to human endeavour. We are all different. There is no such thing as a standard or run of the mill human being--but we share the same human spirit. However bad life may seem, there is always something you can do, and succeed at. While there's life, there is hope. \nAPPLAUSE, STANDING OVATION. \nANGLE ON: ELAINE, clapping - proud. \nANGLE ON: STEPHEN, in his chair, on the stage, sees ELAINE. Smiles. \nANGLE ON: BRIAN and SCIAMA clapping. \nANGLE ON: STEPHEN, surprised by the reaction. THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   91 \nINT. LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nJANE is studying again, going through her IBERIAN POEMS, when JONATHAN walks in with the MAIL, and sets one LETTER in front of her. JANE opens it. \nJANE It's from Stephen. (READING) He's--he has invited--the children and I--to accompany him. \nJONATHAN reads her card, and then look at her, surprised. \nJONATHAN Gosh. \nEXT. BUCKINGHAM PALACE, LONDON - DAY \nThe PALACE. \nINT. EMPIRE ROOM, BUCKINGHAM PALACE - DAY \nWe are BACK in the FIRST SCENE OF THE MOVIE. \nJANE moves close to STEPHEN. They look at each other in the eyes for the first time in a long while. They finally SMILE tenderly, and then - \nJANE Your glasses are always dirty. \nSTEPHEN'S POV as - his glasses are removed from his nose by JANE, cleaned, and then replaced on his nose. He is moved by this old ritual. \nThe HAWKINGS then sit silently, but happily, surrounded by exquisite paintings and furniture. \nINT.

You have to bring him round from the anaesthetic! \nSWISS DOCTOR Are you sure this is what you want? The only way of weaning him off the ventilator would be to give him a tracheotomy, a hole in the neck, by-passing the throat. He will never speak again. \nJANE stares at him - deeply upset but finally manages to SAY - \nJANE There's no question. Stephen must live. I will see he gets everything he needs. I will have him transferred back to Cambridge. \nSWISS DOCTOR He may not survive the journey. \nJANE looks pale and weaker than we have ever seen her. \nEXT. AIRPORT, GENEVA - DAY \nOn the tarmac, the two HAWKING children are led toward a BA FLIGHT (in the far distance) by an AIR-HOSTESS. \nMeanwhile, A small AIR-RESCUE PLANE nearby awaits JANE and STEPHEN. STEPHEN is just then being loaded on board. \nJANE turns and faces JONATHAN. A private moment. Her LOOK OF SADNESS speaks volumes. He NODS - he KNOWS. \nJONATHAN I'll step back. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   72 \nCONTINUED: \nShe NODS, SADLY. Her eyes start to well up. His too. It's a break-up. Turning to look back to the plane... \nJANE Drive--safely, yes? Did you get everything in the car? His chair, equipment... \nJONATHAN nods. \nShe KISSES   him on the cheek and he presses his cheek against hers. They   both hold onto each other for a moment, knowing it's their   final embrace, and then she hurries, tearfully, toward the   WAITING PLANE, leaving him standing there. \nINT.

Or alone. There is a plastic FLANGE over the TRACHEOTOMY HOLE. \nANGLE ON the FINGERS of his right hand, resting on the arm of the wheelchair. These, at least, can still move. \nJANE (O.S.) Stephen? \nJANE moves into STEPHEN's limited POV - holding a CLEAR PLASTIC SCREEN - an E-TRAN \"SPELLING\" BOARD, on which 6 groups of characters are arranged. \nJANE (CONT'D) This is a Spelling Board. First, you tell me what letter you want by blinking when I say the colour of the group that contains that letter. Once I know the group, you can choose the character inside that group by blinking again when I go through the colours of each letter in that group. Apparently. Okay? Let's just try. \nSTEPHEN says nothing. \nJANE (CONT'D) So...Green, Yellow, Blue, White, Black, Red. (SILENCE) Blink to choose the group that contains the letter you want? Green? Yellow? Blue? White? Black? Red? \nAs JANE's eyes fill with TEARS...STEPHEN just keeps looking at her...then TRIES TO SPEAK.

LIVING ROOM/WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nELAINE holds the E-TRAN BOARD and writes down a letter, then looks up at STEPHEN - sees through the clear perspex immediately what group he is looking at. She doesn't have to call out the colours - knows them. (See her POV of him through the board so we establish the eye-line principle.)

I know what men are like. \nSURPRISED, STEPHEN finds himself with the PENTHOUSE open before him. He looks at the MAGAZINE, then at ELAINE, then at the MAGAZINE. \nJust then - office DOOR OPENS.      Enter, SCIAMA. He stops when he sees the MAGAZINE. \nSCIAMA Oh. I'm sorry. \nHe exits, blushing. STEPHEN grins.

So I said - I have long been looking for a model of the universe. I finally found her. \nBeside the PHOTO, ELAINE finishes SHAVING STEPHEN - then steps away to pick up some HAND LOTION. She inadvertently show him some LEG. STEPHEN notices. \nELAINE laughs, and starts to massage LOTION, almost lovingly, into his HAND. JANE announce her presence. \nJANE Elaine? Can we - ? \nELAINE comes over to JANE, still chuckling. \nJANE (CONT'D) Would you mind if I spoke with Stephen alone for a moment? \nELAINE We're not quite finished--can you come back in ten minutes? \nREACTION JANE: Slightly ruffled feathers. She exits. \nINT. MASTER BED./WEST ROAD FLAT/CAMBRIDGE - DAY \nJANE walks in, holding a page from the MANUSCRIPT. STEPHEN is 'typing' a message. \nJANE (READS) \"Who are we? Why are we here?

His eyes flick between his screen and her. \nJANE They said - two. We've had so many. \nThe look in his eyes is his eloquent reply. Emotion overcomes JANE. Can this really be how it ends? \nIt's so sad and bizarre and they both realise it in this moment. She tries to hide her tears by walking away from him and turning her back, hiding her face. \nSTEPHEN watches her, as aware of the enormous significance of this moment as she - then slowly - slowly - motors toward her. He stops just behind her, then nudges her leg, ever so gently, with his own lifeless foot, the way a pony will nudge its familiar rider. \nHe clicks \"PLAY\" - \nSTEPHEN Be.

Some FANS, autograph hunters, hold copies of \"BRIEF HISTORY\" for STEPHEN to sign. Others just want to take PHOTOS. The general impression? STEPHEN is now a ROCK STAR. \nAfter a MALE FAN gets his PHOTO taken with STEPHEN - a FEMALE FAN (at the head of a sudden queue of FANS bearing copies of \"BRIEF HISTORY\") holds out a PEN to STEPHEN... \nFEMALE FAN Professor? Could you please sign a copy for me? \nELAINE, gestures for STEPHEN to give his standard reply.

I first met--the Professor--was it really 1963? Time- -where does it go? Back then, he was kind of annoying. (LAUGHTER) He knew things that his woeful work ethic should not have allowed him to know. (LAUGHTER) (MORE) \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   88 \nCONTINUED: SCIAMA (CONT'D) But it's been--really--one of the great joys of my life to watch this man defy every expectation, both scientific and personal. So it's with no small pride that I ask him to return to the stage once more, to continue to do what he has always done - answer your questions. My most irritating student, my esteemed colleague, my good friend--Professor Hawking. \nAs STEPHEN motors onto the stage, to applause - \nSCIAMA (CONT'D) The first pre-selected question, please! \nGUEST 1, stands and reads her question from a SLIP OF PAPER. (All the Questioners will do the same.) \nGUEST 1 How have you been able to deal with all the physical challenges you face? \nSTEPHEN stares at the AUDIENCE, who wait awkwardly for a reply. It's as if STEPHEN wishes to speak with his own voice, and is struggling to do so. In failure his eyes turn sadly to his screen, and then clicks the pad in his hand. WE HEAR: \nSTEPHEN Can you hear me? (AUDIENCE LAUGHTER) There are some things I cannot do. But. They are mostly the things I don't particularly want to do anyway. \nGUEST 2 Now you are recognized everywhere, how do you deal with all the attention? \nSTEPHEN I was stopped recently by a tourist in Cambridge who asked if I was 'the real Stephen Hawking.' I replied that I was not, and said the real one was--much better looking. \nLaughter. \nSTEPHEN (CONT'D) He believed me. \n(CONTINUED) THE THEORY of EVERYTHING   89 \nCONTINUED: (2) \nEven bigger LAUGH.

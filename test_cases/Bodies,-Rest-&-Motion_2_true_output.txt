Nick jerks the car back into his lane, bats the map down again, and pulls off to the side of the road. 
He stops the car and slams the shift into park. 
He opens his door a crack, turning on the dome light. He smooths out the map on the dashboard. 
Billings and Enfield are marked with Carol's big red circles. 
CLOSE-UP - THE MAP 
Nick's finger traces from Enfield toward Billings along the route Carol highlighted with the red felt-tip. Halfway to Billings, the red line stops. Nick's finger stops. 
NICK 
He stares at the map. 
CUT TO: 
INT. BETH'S LIVING ROOM - CONTINUOUS 
Beth comes in the front door. The sound of Sid whistling comes softly from the kitchen. 
Beth stares at the t.v. for a moment then strides purposefully toward the kitchen. 
INT. BETH'S KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Sid is standing on the counter masking the top sill of the kitchen window. There's half a donut hanging from his mouth. 
Beth comes through the swinging door. 
BETH (forcefully) You've lived here your whole life? 
The half-donut falls from the startled Sid's mouth. 
SID (after a beat) Yeah. 
BETH (increduously) You've never gone anywhere? 
He picks up the half-donut. 
SID Travelling has no allure for me. 
BETH None? 
Sid climbs down and sits on the counter, dropping the half- donut back into the donut box. 
SID Maybe through time. 
BETH (smiling) That's not offered. 
SID So I stay here. 
BETH Why? 
SID (the simple truth) It's my home. I belong here. 
BETH I'm serious. 
So was Sid -- but he realizes Beth doesn't believe it can be as simple as that. 
SID My father says if you stay in one place long enough your luck knows where to find you. 
BETH (wryly) Maybe that's my problem. 
SID (carefully) Maybe it is... 
Sid holds out the box of donuts to her. 
BETH Thanks. 
She takes a donut and fiddles with it. 
BETH You think your father knows the truth? 
SID He's a bartender. (smiling) He's lived here his whole life. 
BETH Has his luck found him? 
SID Not yet. (after a beat) But it's probably very close.

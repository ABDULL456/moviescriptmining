A CLOAKED FIGURE. It's a violent battle of wills which ends when the Cloaked Figure kicks up the dead Soldier's sword and impales it into the Mogadorian's chest. The Soldier EVISCERATES in a cloud of HISSING cinders. Young John watches in awed terror as the Cloaked Figure steps towards him and pulls back his hood. 
IT'S HENRI. He looks younger, the years of hiding have aged him. John's grandfather lifts a familiar crystal pendant from his neck and places it over Young John's head. 
GRANDFATHER This is your Cepan. Go with him. 
YOUNG JOHN No! 
HENRI Your life is my life now. I will always protect you. 
GRANDFATHER 
(TO HENRI) He must survive. A BLAST scorches across the space. Henri spots 
A MOGADORIAN COMMANDER hunkered behind a column, his red coat billows behind him like a curse. 
GRANDFATHER They are already hunting you! Go! Henri plucks a crystal ankle-dagger from his boot, grabs young John and charges up. As the Commander breaks cover, Henri hurls the dagger. 
THE COMMANDER dives out of its path but ROARS as the blade SPARK-RIPS across his right cheek like a hot poker. 
EXT. TEMPLE - NIGHT 
Henri yanks Young John by the hand. They take off in one direction while John's grandfather heads off in the other. 
A MOGADORIAN TRANSPORT CRAFT suddenly swoops between them. The HOWLS of its occupants ricochet through the night. The heat from its engines washes the ground, warping the destruction like a ghastly mirage as two bay doors open. Young John looks back through the heat- haze and catches a impressionistic view as 
TWO PIKEN leap out. Their reptilian bodies ripple with muscle and their oversize heads glint with raptor-like jaws. The Piken mercilessly rip into John's grandfather. Young John races to help, but Henri wrenches him back. CAMERA PUSHES IN TIGHT ON YOUNG JOHN'S FACE as he screams... 
YOUNG JOHN Nooooooooooo! THE MEMORY ENDS and we... 
MATCH CUT TO: 
INT. GARAGE - DAY 
TIGHT ON JOHN screaming... 
JOHN Nooooooooooo! He drops the crystal and stumbles back. The experience has left him traumatized. Henri steps towards him, but John is too overwhelmed and runs out. 
EXT. STREAM - WOODS - DAY 
A stone angrily SKIPS across the water. John is about to toss another when Bernie Kosar trots into view. He ruffles the dog's fur but doesn't turn when Henri steps out of the woods and crosses to his side. 
JOHN I saw my grandfather. I saw what you did to the Mogadorians -- you saved my life. 
HENRI A lot of Lorics sacrificed their lives so that you could live. 
John is still trying to process the memory. 
JOHN He said I must survive. 
HENRI The Elders had a plan. You weren't on that ship by chance. The nine of you were chosen for a reason. Even if only two of you live, together you'll pose a grave threat to our enemy. Consumed by bitterness, John hurls another stone. 
JOHN You saw what they did to Lorien. How can nine or six or two of us take on that army? It's hopeless. Henri knows he has to pull him out of this mournful funk. 
HENRI I never thought we'd get off Lorien alive -- but we did. I didn't know how we could survive on a strange planet -- but we have. I gave us six months before the Mogs found us -- it's been 10 years. Don't give up now. Henri grips John's shoulders. 
HENRI You have the potential to do great things. Even if you don't see it -- I do. 
JOHN How can you put so much faith in me? 
HENRI Because your life is my life. If you quit, then everything I've worked for and sacrificed is meaningless. 
(BEAT) Remember -- nothing is inevitable. The fragile SILENCE is broken when John's cell phone BLEATS. He scans a text. 
JOHN It's Sarah. The Block Party's tonight. I'll say I can't make it. Henri sees John is wracked with doubt and confusion.

The Time Traveller is staring into the fire stirring the glowing embers as he speaks slowly and with compassion, hoping to arouse some feeling within her, even though she may not grasp the meaning of the words. 
TIME TRAVELLER Man's past is mainly a grim struggle for survival, but there have been moments when a few voices have spoken up.  These rare moments have made the history of man a glorious thing.  I refuse to believe it is dead and gone. We've had our dark ages before and this is only another of them.  All you need is for someone to show you the way out. - I'm only a tinkering mechanic, but there must be this hidden spark in one of your people. If I can only kindle that spark, my coming here will have some meaning. 
During his speech Weena has cuddled close to him, her cheek touching his knee.  He looks down at her and sees he has made a friend.  He places his hand gently on her hair.  She looks up, her eyes no longer showing fear.  Their faces are illuminated by the dancing flames. 
THE FIRE - CLOSE SHOT                                  227 
It CRACKLES reassuringly.

EXT. WELL - FULL SHOT - (DAY)                          228 
The ring of flames from the previous scene is seemingly replaced by a dark, circular shaft from which comes the low THROBBING of some GIANT MACHINES, pounding, beating monotonously.  The CAMERA MOVES BACK to include the LANDSCAPE where more wells are visible in the distance, each surrounded by a low, porcelain wall.  Their roofs are shining brass-like disks. 
Across the field, from the direction of the sphinx, approach the Time Traveller, carrying his jacket over his shoulder, and a few steps behind, Weena. 
TIME TRAVELLER'S VOICE My efforts next morning to open the panel were fruitless.  I had to find another way to retrieve my Machine. 
Weena, concerned, stands back as the Time Traveller walks up to the well in the f.g. and peers down into: 
THE SHAFT - HIGH ANGLE                                 229 
It descends into darkness, but near the top can be seen handholds in an irregular pattern.  The THROBBING OF MACHINES is ominous. 
AT THE MOUTH OF WELL - FULL SHOT                       230 
The Time Traveller in the f.g. turns back to Weena. 
TIME TRAVELLER Listen! (pause) Do you hear? 
WEENA (fearfully) Yes. 
TIME TRAVELLER Machines! 
WEENA No...Morlocks. 
TIME TRAVELLER (straightening, amazed) You mean those animals run machines? 
WEENA They are Morlocks. 
TIME TRAVELLER (as he walks to her) I know, but have you seen the machines? 
CLOSE ON WEENA                                         231 
She shakes her head. 
WEENA No, only heard of them. 
The CAMERA EASES BACK to include the Time Traveller as he reaches her. 
TIME TRAVELLER Who told you? 
WEENA The talking rings. 
TIME TRAVELLER (moves closer to her) What sort of rings? 
WEENA (with a shrug) Rings that talk. 
TIME TRAVELLER Can you show me these rings? 
Weena nods and starts off.  He follows her.

GERTRUDE I moved back about six months ago.   I'm teaching second grade.   At Baranof. 
RICHARD Did your husband move up here too? 
GERTRUDE Uh, no.   I, ah, got divorced. 
RICHARD Oh my God.   I'm sorry. 
GERTRUDE Me too.   But hey, we're being rude, I wanna meet the bride. Gertrude leaves Richard and goes to Margaret. 
GERTRUDE (cont'd) Hi, I'm Gertrude.   But call me Gert. 
MARGARET You're a Gertrude? 
GERTRUDE A family name from hell. 
MARGARET I'm sure it's been a curse. 
GEOFFREY Gert and Richard were quite the item in high school. Gertrude instantly dismisses Geoffrey's reminiscence. 
GERTRUDE Oh Please.   Ancient history. 
GEOFFREY Feels like yesterday to me. 
GERTRUDE (ignoring Geoffrey) So tell me everything.   I hear it wasn't exactly love at first sight? 
MARGARET Not exactly... 
GRANDMA ANNIE Now Richard, what I want to know is how you proposed. This grabs the group's full attention.   Everyone loves to hear a story like this. 
RICHARD Well... Richard hasn't recovered from seeing Gertrude. RICHARD (cont'd) Uh, uh, um, I... 
GEOFFREY Yeah.   How did you pop the question? Richard is a deer in the headlights.   This is getting ugly. Margaret sees that Richard is going to crumble, and steps in. 
MARGARET Can I tell this one, honey? 
RICHARD Uh.   Sure. 
MARGARET I'm an early, early riser and go for a run everyday.   Well, it was our six month anniversary and I was out for my normal jog in the park, when who do I see in a horse drawn carriage, wearing a tux, and waiting for me halfway through my run?   Richard!   So I ran up to the carriage and asked him what was going on, and he put his finger to his lips and says, "shhhh."   So there I am in my jogging clothes, next to the most handsome mute in the world - have you seen him in a tux? - riding like a sweaty princess and smiling ear to ear.   Couple minutes later, we arrive at Tavern on the Green.   Best part, we're the only people in the place because Richard got them to open up early. Well, we go to our table, sit down, and just as the sun starts to peek above the trees, this beautiful man gets down on one knee, and says "I didn't want one more sunrise to go by without you knowing that you are the light of my life, and that I would be the luckiest man in the world if you would be my wife.   Margaret Mary Mills, will you marry me?" The group is silent, waiting for the clincher. MARGARET (cont'd) I said yes. The group gives a collective "ahh".   Grandma Annie takes both Margaret and Richard by the hand. 
GRANDMA ANNIE You are a good boy Richard, and you make me very proud.   I love you Richy. 
RICHARD I love you too, Grandma. Grandma hugs the couple.   Everyone smiles except Geoffrey and Gertrude. 
GEOFFREY So did this happen before or after the INS agent came sniffing around? 
DEBBIE What is wrong with you?   I'm sorry Margaret. Margaret doesn't miss a beat. 
MARGARET Oh please.   I'd wonder too.   Honestly, my lawyers have been dealing with all of this. When you told us at the airport it was the first time I'd heard about it.   I'm so embarrassed. 
DEBBIE Don't be, dear.   Geoffrey's just an ass. While Debbie apologizes, Margaret gives Richard a little wink that says "I've got this under control".   The moment is interrupted when Richard pulls out a RINGING CELL PHONE.   He takes a step back and answers quietly so no one can hear. 
RICHARD Margaret Mill's phone. (off answer) One second please. Richard comes back to the group and hands Margaret the phone. RICHARD (cont'd) It's our friend, Frank. Richard's tone let's Margaret know there's a problem. 
MARGARET Excuse me, I'll just be a second. Margaret takes the phone and exits out French glass doors that lead to the backyard.   She leaves the door open, and doesn't notice Balzac follow her outside. 
EXT. PAXTON BACKYARD - DAY - CONTINUOUS 
Margaret goes far from the house so no one can hear.   Balzac follows her all the way, but Margaret doesn't see him. 
MARGARET Don't be a cliche, Frank.   Don't be the wishy washy writer who changes his mind every two seconds. Margaret notices Balzac, but ignores him.   The dog starts YAPPING to get attention.   She walks away, but Balzac continues barking. Annoyed, she gets down face to face with the puppy and puts the phone against her chest so Frank doesn't hear. MARGARET (cont'd) (to Balzac) Sit and be quiet! Balzac sits and pouts.   Margaret walks away and puts the phone back to her ear. 
MARGARET (cont'd) I fired Bob because he didn't have your best interest in mind.   Our job is to help you succeed.   He wasn't doing that. Margaret continues to listen to her writer whine, when she notices an EAGLE soaring in circles above her and Balzac.   Not sure what to think, she looks back at Balzac and sees him peacefully sit in the grass. She then looks up and sees that the eagle is gone.   Margaret shakes her head, looks back at Balzac when -- WHOOSH!   The eagle snatches Balzac by the scruff of the neck, and takes off.   Margaret jumps. There is no one to help, so she chases after the dog and eagle. She stays calm on the phone. MARGARET (cont'd) Could you hold on just a second? With no other option, Margaret throws her cell phone and hits the eagle suspended 20 feet above her.   The eagle drops Balzac and Margaret catches him.   Balzac looks frightened. Tucking Balzac away like a furry football, she runs to her phone and picks it up. MARGARET (cont'd) 
(NONCHALANT) Sorry, dropped my phone. Margaret looks up and sees that the eagle has resumed flying in circles above her.   She decides to wrap up the call quick and get back to the house. MARGARET (cont'd) Frank, I don't want to sell you on anything. But know this.   This book is your legacy... Margaret looks up and sees the eagle dive towards her and Balzac again.   She runs. MARGARET (cont'd) ... and-I-think-you-should-be-the-one-to introduce-your-legacy-to-the-world. Call me- tomorrow-with-your-decision.   My-phone is- always-on.   Talk-to-you-soon. The eagle bears down on them with talons out.   Just as the eagle is about to strike, Margaret sticks out her hand with the phone to fend back the eagle.   To her surprise, the eagle grabs Margaret's phone and flies off.   Margaret freaks. MARGARET (cont'd) 
Panicked, she takes Balzac in both hands and puts him up to the eagle as an offering. MARGARET (cont'd) Take the dog!   Take the dog!

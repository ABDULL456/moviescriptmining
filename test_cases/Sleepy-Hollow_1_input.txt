ICHABOD Go! 
Ichabod takes the reins from Young Masbath. 
ICHABOD Help her. 
Reins in one hand and saw in the other, Ichabod waits.  The Horseman rises up and moves in, taking out his sword. 
Young Masbath climbs down to the wooden pole connecting the coach to the bridles, puts out his hand.  Katrina takes it. 
Behind, the Horseman swings.  Ichabod blocks with the saw. 
Young Masbath guides Katrina as she leaps onto one horse. Bareback.  Young Masbath straddles the horse beside her. 
The Horseman swings, backhanded knocks the sword from Ichabod's hand as Ichabod falls back... 
Ichabod hits the bridle post, hanging onto straps for dear life.  His feet drag on the trail. 
Above, the Horseman comes to the driver's perch, close enough to kill Katrina.  He raises his sword... 
Katrina screams, ducking, helpless... 
Below, Ichabod pulls a bolt from the coach's hitching-rod. 
He shoves off with his feet. 
The Horseman swings.... missing. 
The horses detach from the coach, dragging Ichabod along. 
The coach careens out of control. 
It flies off the trail, hits an incline and sails off, throwing the Horseman. 
The coach hits a tree trunk and SMASHES. 
FURTHER DOWN THE TRAIL, the coach horses stop.  Young Masbath and Katrina climb off as Ichabod gets to his feet, hurting, clutching his previously wounded shoulder. 
YOUNG MASBATH What now? 
ICHABOD I doubt that's the end. 
KATRINA The church. 
ICHABOD He moves too fast. 
Ichabod unhooks a lantern off the bridle rail.  The trail behind is silent, till a bone chilling SCREECH is HEARD. 
KATRINA What was that? 
ICHABOD His horse. 
They start moving.  Ichabod looks around.  He sees... 
ICHABOD There... 
Through the tree line, the Hollow's massive windmill can be seen against the sky.  Katrina and Young Masbath run. 
EXT. WINDMILL FIELD -- NIGHT 
Ichabod, Katrina and Young Masbath book into this open area, heading to the windmill.  Another HORRIBLE SQUEAL echoes. 
Ichabod looks over his shoulder. 
Heavy, low hanging BRANCHES and VINES at the forest edge creep to life, parting... forming a sort of black tunnel. 
ICHABOD He's coming! 
The Horseman gallops out, throwing leaves in his wake. 
ICHABOD Hurry! 
The Horseman readies a battle axe. 
Ichabod gets under the windmill, helping Young Masbath up the ladder and in.  Katrina next. 
The Horseman is almost there. 
Ichabod follows Katrina.  He gets in, feet dangling.  The Horseman dismounts... 
INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
Ichabod leaps up and struggles with the heavy trap door... slams it.  He closes the latch just as the Horseman hits. The door buckles. 
YOUNG MASBATH It won't hold. 
Ichabod goes to a large GRINDSTONE against a wall.  He struggles to roll it. 
Young Masbath helps him roll it to the trap door.  It falls on top with a thud.  The Horseman's sword jabs up through the grindstone's center hole. 
The sword withdraws.  A POUNDING begins. 
EXT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
The Horseman chops at the door with his axe. 
INT.  WINDMILL -- NIGHT 
POUNDING CONTINUES.  The grindstone shifts.  Katrina and Young Masbath back away.  Ichabod holds his lantern up, desperate for ideas, searching. 
Above, to the right, is the milling platform, where grain is ground and bagged.  To the left is the crooked staircase.

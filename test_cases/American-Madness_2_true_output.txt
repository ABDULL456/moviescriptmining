Mr. Williams . . . 
MATT 
(continuing) 
The big guys have got the screws on him. You've got to come through for him, Mr. Conway. He came through for you a hundred times. If his friends don't help him, who is going to help him? 
HELEN 
(looking up from her own phone pitch) 
Matt, look! There's Mr. Jones! 
CUT TO: 
267. INT. LOBBY OF BANK - MED. SHOT 
As a man elbows his way thru the crowd to a receiving teller's window. He is accompanied by a bank guard, who sweeps the disbelieving crowd aside. He speaks loudly for everyone's benefit: 
JONES 
Any bank that Tom Dickson has anything to do with is all right. I'm putting my money in here. Why should you be afraid? Give him a chance. Tom Dickson is all right! He's perfectly square. I'm putting my money in this bank! I know what I'm doing! 
He reaches a teller's window, which is closed. He pounds on it. 
JONES 
Open up! I want to put some money in here! I don't want to take any out! 
A teller's face appears, somewhat astonished. 
TELLER 
(recovering composure) 
Certainly, Mr. Jones! Certainly! Charlie!

They're starting to come in already. Yeah. Yeah. Well, listen. Don't waste any time. Get all the money you can lay your hands on, and bring it down here right away. Step on it. 
He hangs up, dials another.

Who's this? 
(into one phone) 
Mr. Williams? 
(into the other phone) 
Mr. Gunther? 
(to Helen) 
I'll talk to both of them at once. 
(holding both phones up to his mouth) 
Listen, both you fellows. Dickson's in a jam. The run's getting worse. Those big guys got the screws on him. Yeah, both you fellows got to come thru for him. Listen, if his friends don't help him, who is going to help him? Now he came through for you a hundred times. Yeah, listen. They're starting to come in already. Yeah, listen.

As several more people elbow their way thru the crowd on their way to teller's windows, speaking aloud. 
MAN 
(loudly) 
Get out of my way. I got money I want to put into the bank. 
CAMERA PANS WITH HIM and second man until they reach the receiving teller's window, where they fall into a line already containing ten or twelve people. 
The second man shoves his way to the front, and addresses the teller: 
2ND MAN 
I want to make a deposit. Four thousand, six hundred dollars. He's the best man in the world. I believe in him.

MRS. DICKSON 
It doesn't matter what you think about me, there's something far more important. Those people down there. The bank, Tom. You can't give that up. 
She is interrupted by sound of door opening. They look off.

The line has grown in size. Those trying to deposit their money are just as excited as those who want to draw it out. 
MAN 
(shouting) 
Tom Dickson is a friend of mine! I'll put money in his bank any time! 
ANOTHER MAN 
(shouting) 
Anybody who takes money out of this bank is crazy! I'm going to put a lot of money in! Here it is!

On Dickson, looking toward Receiving Teller's window. He stares at the miraculous spectacle, deeply moved. He can scarcely believe his own eyes. A smile grows on his face. 
The sight of his friends coming to his rescue has an electrical effect on Dickson. It revives his fighting spirit. He sticks his jaw out determinedly. Without a word he turns and crosses to door of conference room.

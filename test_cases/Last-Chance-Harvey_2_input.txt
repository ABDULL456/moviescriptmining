HARVEY (smiling) And also if he ever hurts her, I know people in north of London. 
Laughter. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) Seriously though. Scott, I swear you have found in Susan a bright and passionate person. And a loyal friend. 
CONGREGATION Hear, hear! 
HARVEY And I can see from the way she looks at you. From the way she is with you, that she is... (beat) (MORE) 
HARVEY (CONT'D) ...happy. (beat) And I thank you and welcome you to the family. 
Harvey and Scott share a look. The room applauds loudly. 
HARVEY (CONT'D) And finally, if I can linger a moment longer. I would like to turn it back over to Brian, with a note of... gratitude. (beat) Thank you for being there for my baby girl. Thank you for being there, when I wasn't. 
Beat. Brian nods to Harvey, before standing and raising his glass. 
BRIAN If you would all please join Harvey and I, in a toast. (beat) To Susan and Scott. 
CONGREGATION Susan and Scott! 
Everyone claps loudly. Susan shares a gentle smile with her Father. Harvey sits and looks at Kate anxiously. Kate smiles and nods. 
KATE Well done. 
HARVEY Really? 
She indicates to the rest of the table. Harvey turns to their now animated young neighbours, who all sit clapping. 
INT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT 
PETE (MC) Ladies and Gentlemen, the first dance. 
The BAND strike up as Susan and Scott take to the dance floor. They dance a slow dance. Harvey and Kate sit watching. 
After a while Susan, looks over for her Father. Harvey hesitates, before Kate encourages him up. She plucks a flower from the table display and places it in his lapel. 
Harvey joins Susan and Scott on the dance-floor. Shaking Scott's hand, he leads Susan into a dance. 
SUSAN Thanks for coming back Dad. 
Beat. 
HARVEY Thanks for having me back. 
Kate looks on, as Harvey dances happily with his daughter. Feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old's head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly. Kate smiles at her lot. 
Back on the dance-floor, Harvey encourages Brian to take over the dance with Susan. Harvey turns away and is joined by Uncle Fred and gang. They all chat animatedly. Uncle Fred pushes Harvey into a dance with his wife. A `Boogie' strikes up. 
Kate looks on as Harvey dances and reunites with his extended family. She sees the delight in his face. She looks around at all the happy faces. It's time perhaps to let the family celebrate alone. 
Extricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two chairs together and makes a bed for him. Covering him in a jacket, she glances back at the dance-floor before turning to leave. 
Back on the dance-floor, a `Boogie' is in full swing. Harvey caught up in the fun, energetically swings Aunt Maddie around. He suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to look for Kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing children. 
Harvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for Kate amongst the crowded room. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
Kate retrieves her coat and makes her way down the hall towards the bank of elevators. 
INT. RECEPTION - NIGHT 
Harvey hurries to the exit. 
INT. HALLWAY - NIGHT 
On turning into the hall, he sees Kate standing in the distance. Just then, she steps forward and out of sight. Harvey runs.

Jim, Curtis' boss, stands with his hands on his hips looking down at the planted shipping container. Curtis approaches. 
CURTIS Hey Jim. 
JIM Curtis. Dewart told me you took equipment from work for a project at your house. Said that's why you wanted him off your crew. I came out here to see it myself. 
CURTIS Yeah. It was just a hauler and a backhoe. It was Saturday. I had `em back in less than 8 hours. 
JIM You know that doesn't matter. I can't even tell you how many rules you broke. 
(MORE) 
JIM (CONT'D) What if you had an accident? Huh? What if you ran somebody over on your way out here? Lawsuit like that could bankrupt me. 
CURTIS Well, I'm sorry Jim. I hadn't thought of that. Thank God nothin' like that happened. You know? I'll do whatever I can to make it right. 
JIM You can pick up your last check on Friday. You've got two weeks benefits. Curtis nods. Accepts it. 
CURTIS Did you fire Dewart? 
JIM He's on two weeks leave unpaid... I'm sorry Curtis. You did this to yourself. Jim turns and walks out of the backyard. 
INT. KITCHEN - CONTINUOUS 
Samantha clears the table. Hannah sits, watching her father walk in. Curtis stops just inside the door, closes it. 
CURTIS I've been fired. Samantha continues clearing the dishes to the sink. She doesn't look up. 
SAMANTHA What about the health insurance? 
CURTIS We get two more weeks. Samantha slams the plates into the sink. They break. She holds her head back and stares at the ceiling. She walks over to Curtis... 
CURTIS (CONT'D) I'm sorry... ...and SLAPS him across the face. Hannah begins to cry. 
Samantha turns and collects Hannah from the table. She grabs her things and walks out of the house. Curtis stands alone in the kitchen.

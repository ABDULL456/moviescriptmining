VEASEY She's got my bastard in her belly. What kind of pistol is that I never saw the like of it? 
EXT. VEASEY TOWN. NIGHT 
Inman leads the horse, with Veasey ahead of him, hands tied behind his back, desperate for a reprieve. 
VEASEY I'm begging you. It's better you blowout my brains than return me to this place. 
INMAN Where does she live? 
VEASEY In our house. She sleeps in our kitchen. You don't know me, friend, but the good Lord punished me with want. I am all appetite. That's all I do all day is want: food, the female parts... 
INMAN Shut your mouth. I don't want a sermon every time I ask a question. 
They're in the town's main drag now. There's a Chapel and next to it, a small house. 
INMAN This your place? 
VEASEY Dear God of misery. 
INMAN You're going to put her back where she sleeps. 
VEASEY I do that the Members will lynch me. Consorting with a nigger, adultery, siring a bastard while serving as their preacher. We're a strict congregation we've churched men for picking up a fiddle on the sabbath. 
INMAN So you reckoned to kill her. 
Disgusted, Inman approaches the front door of the house. 
VEASEY There's a back door. Have pity. 
And he leads Inman down a side path. 
INT. VEASEY HOUSE. NIGHT 
Veasey comes in, now carrying the girl. Inman comes behind, the gun trained on Veasey as he sets her down by the fire. 
VEASEY (whispering) Thank you. I was going to do a grievous wrong. 
He looks longing at the girl as he puts the blanket around her shoulders. He turns to Inman. 
VESEY You tasted dark meat? Sweet as liquorice. I think I should go back up to my wife. She wakes at the slightest noise. 
Inman is incredulous that he thinks he can just go to bed... 
INMAN You find me some paper and a pen. 
EXT. CHAPEL, VEASEY TOWN. DAWN 
INMAN HAS TIED A VERY DISTRAUGHT VEASEY TO A TREE IN FRONT OF HIS CHAPEL. Inman is pinning a sheet of paper above Veasey's head. It's covered in handwriting. A dog barks. 
VEASEY You're not entitled to judge me! You're nothing but an outlier, plain as daylight! 
Inman has pulled a handkerchief from Veasey's jacket. He stuffs it into his mouth, cutting this diatribe short. And then he walks away leaving Veasey tied to the tree, cursing through the handkerchief. 
INT. ADA'S BEDROOM, BLACK COVE FARM. PREDAWN 
Ada asleep. Ruby enters, shattering the calm. 
RUBY Morning. Pigs: you have any loose in the woods? 
ADA No. What? No. We bought our hams. 
RUBY There's a world more to a hog than the two hams! Lard, for example, we'll need plenty -- 
She picks up some discarded laundry, contemplates the overflowing laundry basket. 
RUBY The catastrophe of Ada Monroe's laundry. (marching out) I can feel you shutting your eyes. 
EXT. BOTTOM FIELD. BLACK COVE FARM. DAY 
Ada and Ruby working with the horse to make the beginnings of A SPLIT RAIL FENCE. As they struggle with a heavy rail, Ruby is testing Ada. 
RUBY What's this wood? 
ADA I don't know. Locust? 
RUBY Where's North? 
ADA North is, North is -- 
RUBY Name me three herbs growing wild on this farm. 
ADA (frustrated with Ruby and with herself) I can't! I can't! All right? I can talk about farming in Latin. Will that do? I can read French. I know Harmony and Counterpoint. I know my Bible. I can name the principal rivers of Europe, but don't ask me to name one stream in this county. I can embroider, but I can't darn, I can arrange cut flowers, but I can't grow them. If a thing has a function, if I might do something with it, it wasn't considered suitable. 
RUBY Why? 
ADA Ruby, you could ask why? about pretty much everything to do with me.

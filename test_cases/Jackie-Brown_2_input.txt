JUDGE You have a recommendation for bail? 
DARGUS Yes, I do, your honor. Based on the defendant's prior conviction and the extreme possibility of flight due to her occupation, the State requests a bond of no less than twenty-five thousand. 
The Judge looks at the report, then at Jackie... 
JUDGE I'll set bond at ten thousand and set the date of August 14th for the arraignment. 
JACKIE When is that, your honor? 
JUDGE That's six weeks from now, Miss Brown. We'll continue this matter then. Owens, case 72242. 
Jackie sits down. 
Dargus sits down next to Nicolet. They smile and giggle together. 
Jackie sees them giggle like fifth graders. It fucking pisses her off. 
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE 
We go from a CLOSEUP of a boiling Jackie, to a perspective from the back of the courtroom. 
We see Jackie in the defendant's area. 
We see the two happy detectives walk past us on their way out of the courtroom. 
ORDELL 
Sits in the back, watching the proceedings without any expression. When he's seen enough, he stands up and out of the shot leaving an EMPTY FRAME. 
FADE TO BLACK 
TITLE CARD 
"MAX CHERRY" 
FADE UP ON: 
INT. MAX CHERRY'S OFFICE - DAY 
The bathroom door in Max's office. We hear a toilet flush behind it. The door opens, and Max Cherry emerges, zipping up his pants with a TV guide in his hand. 
He looks up and stops dead. 
Ordell sitting oh-so comfortably in the chair in front of Max's desk. 
ORDELL Unh... unh... unh... I din't hear you wash your hands. 
Max looks at Ordell, then takes his place behind his desk. 
MAX Comfortable? 
ORDELL The door was opened, so I just came right in. 
MAX I can see that. Why? 
ORDELL I got some more business for ya. 
MAX Oh, yeah? What did he do? 
ORDELL (O.S.) She is an airline stewardess. Got caught coming back from Mexico with some blow. They set her bond this afternoon at ten thousand. Now, what I was thinkin', you could use the ten thousand you owe me from Beaumont and move it over on to the stewardess. 
MAX The bond for possession is only a thousand. 
ORDELL They fuckin' wit' her. They callin' it Possession with Intent. A black woman in her forties gets busted with less than two ounces on her, they call that shit Intent. Same shit happened to a movie star. It's Possession. 
MAX It still sounds high. 
ORDELL She had, I believe it was... fifty grand on her, too. There was a cop at the hearing. Young guy with L.A.P.D. wanted her bond set at twenty-five thousand, saying there was a risk of flight. Jackie being a stewardess and all. 
MAX Before we start talking about stewardess, let's get Beaumont out of the way first. 
Sitting back in the chair - almost grinning - but not quite. 
ORDELL Somebody already did. 
MAX What? 
ORDELL You didn't hear? 
MAX Hear what? 
ORDELL Somebody with a grudge blew Beaumont's brains out - hey, that rhymes - blew Beaumont's brains out. 
MAX Did the police contact you? 
ORDELL Very first motherfuckin' thing they did. They see I put up a big money bond on my boy, they start thinking with that where-there's-smoke-there's fire logic. They roust my ass outta bed, ten o'clock in the morning. Fuckin' scare my woman, Sherona, half to death. She thought they were gonna take my ass away for sure. 
MAX The stewardess. Do you know her last name? 
ORDELL (smiles) Brown, Jackie Brown. 
MAX What does she do for you? 
ORDELL Who says she does anything for me? She's my friend. When my friends get into trouble, I like to help 'em out. 
MAX Beaumont worked for you. 
ORDELL That's what the police thought. I told them I'm unemployed, how could I have anybody work for me? Now I bail out Jackie, I'm liable to have the police on me again, huh? Wanting to know was she doing things for me, was she bringing me that money! 
MAX Was she? 
ORDELL Is this, me and you, like a lawyer- client relationship? The lawyer can't tell nothing he hears? 
MAX You're not my client until you get busted and I bond you out. 
ORDELL If there's no - what do you call it - confidentiality between us? Why would I tell you anything? 
MAX Cause you want me to know what a slick guy you are. You got stewardesses bringing you fifty grand. 
ORDELL Why would a stewardess bring me fifty grand? 
MAX You want me to speculate on what you do. I'd say you're in the drug business, except the money's moving in the wrong direction. Whatever you're into, you seem to be getting away with it, so more power to you. Okay you want another bond, and you want to move over the ten thousand you put down on Beaumont to the stewardess. That means paperwork. I have to get a death certificate, present it to the court, fill out a receipt for return of bond collateral, then type up another application. An indemnity agreement - 
ORDELL - Jackie aint got time for all that shit - 
MAX - I'm telling you what I have to do. What you have to do, in case you forgot, is come up with premium of a thousand bucks. 
ORDELL I got it. I just don't got it on me. 
MAX Well, come back when you do, and I'll bond out the stewardess. 
ORDELL Man, you know I'm good for it. Thousand bucks ain't shit. 
MAX If I don't see it in front of me, you're right. It ain't shit. 
ORDELL Man, you need to look at this with a little compassion. Jackie ain't no criminal. She ain't used to this kinda treatment. I mean, gangsters don't give a fuck - but for the average citizen, coupla nights in County fuck with your mind. 
MAX Ordell, this isn't a bar, an you don't have a tab.

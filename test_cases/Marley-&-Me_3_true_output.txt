(THEN) Why don't you come by my office on your way out and we can talk some more. He exits. John is still holding the blank videotape. He tries to hide it from Jenny. He leaves. Jenny and John look at each other. 
JENNY How could this happen? What'd I do wrong? 
JOHN You didn't do anything-- 
JENNY I must have. Otherwise, how could I lose it? 
80 CONTINUED: (3) 
JOHN Jenny, it's not something you have any control over. It's like the doctor said, it just happens-- 
JENNY Not to me... I did something wrong. I know it... I did something wrong. I'm sorry, John... 
JOHN Don't say that-- 
JENNY But I am-- I'm sorry-- 
JOHN I don't need sorry. You didn't do anything! She turns away and begins to cry. John just sits there, staring at the videotape in his hands. Outside in the hall, the door to another examining room opens and they hear a couple laughing, talking excitedly. Jenny and John look away from each other, their pain made even worse. 
81 INT. CAR - DAY (MOVING) 
John is driving Jenny home. 
JOHN In a couple of months, we can try again. Okay? Jenny just looks out the window. 
82 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - KITCHEN - DAY 
John helps Jenny through the kitchen door. Marley follows them, circles them wildly, then stops, puzzled, as he looks at them. Jenny goes into the living room; Marley follows her. 
JOHN You want some tea? 
(NO ANSWER) Hey, you know what I was thinking? We still have those tickets from your parents for the honeymoon in Ireland. We can finally do that. 
(MORE) 
82 CONTINUED: 82 
JOHN (CONT'D) Take some time off. It'll be fun, clear our heads, right? 
(NO RESPONSE) Jenny? No answer. He goes into the living room and stops cold: 
JOHN'S POV - JENNY & MARLEY Jenny sits on the couch. Marley stands at her feet, with his shoulders between her knees, his big head resting in her lap. His tail hangs flat between his legs. His eyes are turned up at her, and he whimpers softly. Jenny strokes his head a few times and then, with no warning, buries her face in the thick fur of his neck and begins sobbing. They stay like that for a moment, Marley statue- still, Jenny clutching him to her like an oversized doll. John stands there, watching Marley take care of her. No words, just being there. A lesson here. Her head down, Jenny raises one arm up towards John and John goes to the couch and wraps his arms around both of them. We then... 
FADE OUT. 
DEBBY (V.O.) Oh. He's... big. 
83 INT. 345 CHURCHILL ROAD - LIVING ROOM - DAY 83 
With difficulty, John holds back Marley to protect DEBBY --- 19, glasses, bookish, the house sitter -- from his affection. 
JOHN Yeah. Close to a hundred pounds. (re: the leash struggle) He just wants to say hi. He won't hurt you. Just stand still and be calm. You're a dog person, right? 
DEBBY well, actually - 
JOHN - Ready? 
DEBBY okay? John releases Marley who springs on Debby, knocking her back. 
Shooting Draft 3106/07 60. 
MARLEY & ME 
83 CONTINUED: 
DEBBY (CONT'D) I'm okay! I'm okay! 
JOHN He's not supposed to do that. You have to knee him. Anyway, it won't happen the whole time. Just maybe when you come home. (handing her a binder) This is everything you need to know. 
84 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - DAY 
John and Jenny lug their suitcases across the front lawn to the car, Marley running around them. Debby's glancing through the binder. 
JENNY'S VOICE Debby. Welcome to our home! Marley is a spirited dog who loves interaction. We've never left him before but we're sure he'll behave just as he does when we're at home. They kiss him goodbye. Get in the cab and go. Debby runs to Marley, grabs his leash and struggles with all her might to hold on to Marley. 
85 INT. AIRPLANE - DAY 
Coach. But this is 1991, and the planes fly half-full. John 
N reads about Ireland in the guide book. Jenny sees a woma with a child. She smiles. No tears. 
JENNY'S VOICE There are just a few things about Marley you need to know. He eats three times a day. If he looks starved, feed him again. Of course all this food has to go somewhere. 
86 EXT. 345 CHURCHILL - BACKYARD - DAY

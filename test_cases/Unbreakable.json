Penny. \nLegend \"1961\" \nAn African-American man carrying two J.C. Penny shopping bags is ushered past the department store managers and security guards on walkies that have gathered at the entrance to the woman's dressing rooms. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DRESSING ROOM - AFTERNOON \nA bed has been formed by a chair and three benches. \nA STRIKING AFRICAN-AMERICAN WOMAN in her twenties lays across it. Her face and clothes are covered in sweat. Her skirt is stained. \nShe holds something wrapped in a soft sweatshirt on her chest. We can't see it, but WE HEAR THE BABY CRYING. \nShe's just given birth. \nThere are three frazzled saleswomen in the dressing room with her. They watch her with quiet smiles. \nA fourth SALESWOMAN arrives ushering in the man with the shopping bags. \nSALESWOMAN This is Mr. Mathison. He's a doctor. \nDR. MATHISON looks over the scene and then directly at the striking woman. \nDR. MATHISON You okay? \nThe woman nods, \"Yes.\" Sweat trickles down her face. THE BABY'S PIERCING CRIES ECHO IN THE SMALL ROOM. \nSALESWOMAN An ambulance is on the way. \nDr. Mathison puts down his shopping bags and moves to her. He kneels down and gestures for the bundle of sweatshirts in her arms. \nDR. MATHISON Is there a name yet? \nBeat. The woman smiles for the first time. \nWOMAN Elijah. \nShe hands him the wrapped child. We can't see the baby, but THE PIERCING CRIES SEEM TO GET LOUDER. \nWOMAN Is he supposed to be crying like that? \nThe doctor lowers the baby to his lap and unwraps him. \nThe woman can't see her baby anymore. She watches Dr. Mathison as he looks down and examines her child. Beat. Dr. Mathison doesn't look up for the longest time. \nWOMAN Can I have him back? \nTHE BABY'S CRYING IS RELENTLESS. UNNERVING. Beat. \nThe doctor finally glances up. He looks shaken. He makes eye contact with the woman for only a second. It's enough. A chill goes through her body. \nHe looks to the three saleswomen who were in the room. \nDR. MATHISON What happened during the delivery? \nHis hard stare unsettles the women. The OLDER SALESWOMAN speaks up. \nOLDER SALESWOMAN Nothing. It was very quick. The baby just wanted to come right out. There was no problems. \nDR. MATHISON Did you drop him? \nEveryone becomes very still. The mother looks like she stopped breathing. THE BABY'S SCREAMING ENGULFS THE ROOM. \nDR. MATHISON Did you drop this baby? \nBeat. \nOLDER SALESWOMAN Jesus Christ, no. \nThe BABY SCREAMS. \nThe doctor whispers something to himself, we can't hear. He looks up to the saleswoman who brought him in. \nDR. MATHISON Please inform the ambulance we have a situation... \nShe goes back to the magazine. \nBeat. \nDAVID How long are you staying in Philly? \nKELLY looks up from her Sports Illustrated. Her striking blue eyes gaze at David. Beat. \nShe holds up her hand. Taps the diamond ring on her finger. \nKELLY(soft) I'm married. \nDAVID(fake excitement) Great. \nBeat. \nKELLY Sorry. \nDAVID(fake confusion) What are you talking about? \nAn awkward silence. \nDAVID I think you got the wrong idea. \nThe woman stares at David. She looks down. Beat. Closes the magazine. \nKELLY I'm going to find another seat. \nKelly gets up. She balances herself against a headrest as the train rumbles. She starts to the back of the car. \nDavid sits alone. He looks like he's drowning, but there's no water. \nHe feels a stare. He glances up. The little girl spies on him from between the seats. \nDavid leans towards the window to avoid eye contact. His hand reaches into his coat and slides out his wedding band. He puts it back on. \nHis temple touches the glass. The vibration of the train begins to lull his eyes closed... Beat. \nDavid's head bounces lightly against the window. \nThe shaking of the glass never allows David's eyes to completely close. \nHe sits up when he realizes the shaking is getting stronger. \nHe looks out the window. The scenery blurs as it flies by. Beat. \nDavid turns. Some of the other passengers start to react as they realize the train is picking up speed. \nThe normal bumps of the tracks become amplified. \nThe WORRIED VOICES OF THE TRAVELERS START FILL THE CABIN. \nThe train goes faster. \nAND THEN THE HIGH PITCHED METAL ON METAL SCREECHING STARTS AS THE TRAIN BEGINS TO TAKE A CURVE. \nDavid's eyes move to the seat in front of him. The little girl is no longer watching him. \nDAVID LOOKS TO THE PASSENGERS ACROSS FROM HIM. He sees the ground slowly drop away in the windows behind them as THEIR SIDE OF THE TRAIN STARTS TO RISE... \nTHE PASSENGERS SCREAM AS THE AMTRAK PASSENGER TRAIN BEGINS TO TILT OFF THE TRACK... \nCUT TO: \nINT. FAMILY ROOM - AFTERNOON \nA boy, age ten, sits on his head on the family couch and watches television upside down. His floppy brown hair spreads out in a circle in front of his red face. He changes channels with a remote control. \nHe moves past the upside down cartoons and the upside down talk shows. He stops on an upside down picture of a crashed train. Beat. \nHis knees come forward as he flips over. He tumbles slowly off the couch and onto the carpet. JEREMY DUNNE gazes at the television screen... A LIVE AERIAL VIEW OF A TRAIN WRECK SMOULDERING BELOW IS SEEN. Two trains are tangled like snakes. \nJeremy gets up and moves to a small table with a phone. Next to the phone is a notepad. On it is written... \n\"Dad - Amtrak 177 - 3:40pm.\" \nJeremy looks at the television. At the bottom of the screen in red block letters that move from right to left are words and numbers...\"The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has derailed... Amtrak Emergency number is 1-800-777-4322... The 3:40 Amtrak 177 has derailed...Amtrak\" \nJeremy doesn't take his eyes off the screen. He makes a small desperate noise that no one hears. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE AFTERNOON \nAn elderly woman can't hold back any longer and SCREAMS. An embarrassed, tortured helpless scream. \nDavid turns and stares at the man. \nMAN IN SCRUBS One, because it seems, in a few minutes, you will officially be the only survivor of this train wreck. (beat) And two, because you don't have a scratch on you. You didn't break one bone. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EMERGENCY RECEPTION AREA - EVENING \nDavid moves through the depressing milky corridors of the hospital. He opens a set of double doors. \nA room crammed with cameras and photographers explodes with movement. \nA CHILD'S VOICE BREAKS THEIR NOISE. \nJEREMY I told you! \nJeremy Dunne pushes forward through the mob of people and cameras. He bursts out and runs to David. He wraps his arms around David's waist. David just stands there, aware that the cameras are catching it all. He's overwhelmed. \nHospital staff and a couple police officers push the media back. \nJeremy tugs David to lean down. He does. \nJEREMY They thought everybody on the train died. \nDavid looks at his son's face. Wipes the tears on his cheek. \nJEREMY I told them they were wrong. \nA woman moves to them. David stands up and faces Megan Dunne. \nJEREMY Mom even cried. \nDavid looks at Megan's eyes. \nJEREMY A lot. \nMegan looks away. \nMEGAN Not a lot. \nThey stand there for a moment. David looks shaken. Jeremy takes hold of his hand. \nJEREMY Let's go home. \nMegan nods. They move to the exit. The pack of cameras and reporters burst to life as they leave the building. They jockey for position to get a last glimpse of David Dunne. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDavid eats a bowl of pasta alone in a modest kitchen. He stares at his hand. Opens and closes it slowly. Beat. \nHe rises and puts the bowl away in the sink. \nINT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT \nDavid stops just before rising the stairs. He glances into a bedroom at the bottom of the stairs. The doorway is half open. He makes eye contact with his wife. Beat. \nDAVID I don't think I got the job in New York. \nMEGAN What does that mean? \nDAVID I'm still going to New York. Just not this second. \nMEGAN I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy. \nDAVID I know. \nBeat. \nDAVID How about in the meantime, you don't sleep in the guestroom anymore? (beat) You sleep in our room. I'll sleep down here. \nBeat. \nMEGAN It stopped being our room a long time ago. (beat) You should go up and get some rest. \nBeat. Megan slowly closes the door to the guest bedroom. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDavid looks at his son asleep in his bed. \nDAVID Jeremy, why don't you go sleep with your mom? \nMOTHER Elijah... \nShe moves in his direction by chance. She finds herself at the entrance to The Hurricane ride. She looks up at the sign above the turnstile. Her worried eyes immediately start searching the young faces in the gray circular compartments. \nHer eyes meet Elijah's. He waves. Her face goes very still. \nA HUGE ROAR OF MACHINERY as the ride starts up. \nElijah yells to his mother as the platform starts running. \nELIJAH I won't get hurt momma! I'm safe! \nHIS WORDS GET EATEN UP BY THE CHEERS OF THE TEENAGERS AND THE GRIND OF MACHINERY. \nThe platform spins. He sees a glimpse of his mother and the red and white striped man. She's pointing at Elijah. \nThe platform turns... Elijah sees a flash of the red and white striped man's angered face as he yells at the frantic woman next to him. \nAnd then the ride speeds up. \nThe gray circular seats start to spin on their own. The teenagers CHEER. \nElijah's eyes fill with joy as the wind plays against his face. \nSuddenly the ride changes directions. The cup-like seats get jerked. Everyone grabs the metal bars to hold on. \nElijah laughs as he smashes into the stuffed animal on his right. It cushions him and then falls to the floor of the compartment along with the other stuffed animal. \nElijah's expression becomes tense as his compartment spins. His hands slide over the rusted metal bar as the sweater unravels. \nElijah looks around... a sudden panic enters his eyes. \nTHE BLURRING IMAGE OF HIS MOTHER NOW IN A GROUP OF RED AND WHITE STRIPED MEN. \nTHE SOUND OF MACHINERY GRINDING IS HEARD as the ride changes directions suddenly. \nElijah's hands rip away from the bar as he gets thrown to the side of the compartment. His shoulder and arm takes the brunt of the impact. WE HEAR SOMETHING CRACK. \nTEENAGERS SCREAM IN EXCITEMENT. ELIJAH JOINS THEM WITH SCREAMS OF HIS OWN. \nThe ride spins its passengers. Elijah's small face looks up at the swirling clouds in a mixture of agony and terror. \nThe ride changes directions. \nElijah is thrust forward. He hits the rusted metal bar square against his chest. WE HEAR MORE CRACKS. \nThe world spins. Giggles and yells fill the air. Elijah slumps down onto the floor of the compartment. \nAnd then finally, the grind of the machinery slows and then comes to a gradual stop. \nTHE TEENAGERS MOAN. \nElijah is facing directly up at the sky. The clouds now move slowly over him. \nWE HEAR COMMOTION. AGITATED VOICES. HIS MOTHER'S DESPERATE VOICE. \nMOTHER(o.s.) His bones... He's not well... \nHER VOICE GETS LOUDER AS SHE MOVES CLOSER TO THE PLATFORM. \nMOTHER(o.s.) Elijah baby... \nThen her face appears as she finds the cup-like seat Elijah is in. She begins to scream. \nElijah lays on the bottom of the compartment. One arm is clutching his chest. The other is curved horrifically like an \"s\". His mouth is open. His eyes are bulging. The last thing we HERE ARE THE SHORT DESPERATE BREATHS of an eight year old child about to black out from the pain. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nPRESENT: EXT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON \nWE EMERGE FROM BLACK to find news vans and reporters lining the street across from a church. They have been cordoned off by a handful of police. Mourners are recorded as they emerge from their cars and enter the church. \nDavid is among the arriving crowd. \nMAN(o.s.) David Dunne! \nAt hearing his name, David turns back as he walks. He can't tell which reporter called his name because all of them seem to react. A storm of camera movement as the group jockeys for the best angle of his troubled face. \nDavid passes a magnetic board as he enters the church. It reads, \"Services for the families and friends of train 177.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. CHURCH - AFTERNOON \nA PRIEST stands before a podium. \nCUT TO: \nINT. EMPLOYEE LOCKER ROOM - MORNING \nA poorly lit changing room. A row of metallic lockers sits against one wall. A bench splits the room. A brown folding table with Dunkin Donuts boxes and bagels on it is crammed in the corner. A puke colored concrete floor sets the tone. \nDavid and three other large men are changing out of their street clothes. They all put on the same yellow short sleeve shirts. The same two words are written on all their backs... \n\"Stadium Security\" \nThis ritual goes on without a word. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MAIN STADIUM CORRIDOR - MORNING \nDavid walks along the massive curved wall around the outer rim of the stadium. As he passes the different walkways we get glimpses of the enormous and empty sixty-thousand seat football stadium on the inside. \nDavid stops at a door marked \"PERSONNEL\". \nCUT TO: \nINT. PERSONNEL OFFICE - MORNING \nDavid knocks on the door as he steps into the cramped reception room to the personnel office. \nThe SECRETARY, an ancient woman with thick flabby arms never stops typing and never looks up as she talks. \nANCIENT SECRETARY Yes? \nDAVID Is Noel in? \nANCIENT SECRETARY No sir he is not. (beat) I read about you in the paper. \nDAVID Oh. \nANCIENT SECRETARY I was in an accident once too. A horse almost trampled me to death. \nDAVID Wow. \nANCIENT SECRETARY I had to put him down. \nBeat. \nDAVID That's a sad story. (beat) Do you think you could ask Noel something for me? \nThe ancient secretary's right hand immediately picks up a pen and positions it over a blank pad. Her left hand keeps typing. She never looks up. \nANCIENT SECRETARY Proceed. \nDAVID Ask if he can check how many sick days I've taken since I've worked here? \nBeat. \nANCIENT SECRETARY Is that the entire message? \nDAVID Yes. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STADIUM FIELD - AFTERNOON \nRain falls in sheets in the stadium. \nDavid stands at the entrance to a tunnel that empties out onto the field. He stands in an imposing dark green rain poncho and hood. The poncho almost touches the ground. The word 'security' on the back has almost faded away. We can barely see David's face under the hood. \nThere is a football game in progress on the enormous field. The players seem unusually small. There is no one in the stands. About four hundred people are on the sidelines of the field watching the players. A soggy limping banner stretched behind them declares, \"The Pennslvania Elementary School Championships.\" \nDavid's eyes scan the tiny figures on the field. His eyes come rest on a surge of activity on the sidelines. Beat. \nDavid steps out into the rain. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. SIDELINES - AFTERNOON \nA handful of red faced fathers are yelling at each other. They're in each other's rain soaked faces. The scene feels on the verge of physical violence. \nDavid and another security guard jog over. David steps in the middle of the tight circle. The men stop yelling in the presence of stadium security. Everyone just stands in the rain glaring at each other. Beat. \nDAVID You know what I think about to calm down? I think about those big fat, hundred and twenty pound turtles that live in the islands. Those suckers never get angry, never get in fights and live longer than all of us and all they do all is sit on the beach and hump other turtles. (beat) Why don't we take a second and think about the turtles? \nNobody moves. Rain washes over the agitated faces. A father breaks the moment. \nFATHER Yeah Jerry why don't you think about the fat ass turtles... Like your fat ass son on the field jeopardizing the rest of our chances at a fucking championship. \nElijah starts back to the businessman shaking his head strongly. \nELIJAH No, no, no, no no... You need to go now. \nBUSINESS MAN What did I say? \nELIJAH Do you see any Telletubbies around here?... Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it?... Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression sitting outside in a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put a quarter in it?... No?... Well that's what you see at a toy store? Any you must think this is a toy store, cause you're in here shopping for an infant named Jeb. One of us has made a gross error and wasted the other person's valuable time... \nElijah's eyes pierce through the shaken man. \nELIJAH This is an art gallery my friend. This is piece of art... \nElijah points at the sketch. \nELIJAH This is one of seventeen original drawings by Fritz Champion remaining in the world. It's value will triple every year... This piece is to be treasured. To be cherished... To be coveted by every single one of your banker friends that think they're better than you. \nThe business man stares at the sketch with large eyes. Beat. \nBUSINESS MAN What if I kept it? \nBeat. \nELIJAH I'm listening. \nBUSINESS MAN I'll keep it in my office room. \nELIJAH What about Jeb? \nBUSINESS MAN I have a lock on the door. \nElijah just stares. \nELIJAH Will it be near a window? \nBUSINESSMAN No direct sunlight will fall on it. \nElijah eyes the man for many seconds. Beat. \nELIJAH Come back in three days. I'll think about it. \nElijah starts to the back. He passes the front door as two customers walk in. Elijah talks over his shoulder to them. \nELIJAH We're by appointment only. \nMAN I received a card from your store. \nELIJAH Congratulations, you have a mailbox... The sale isn't for two weeks. \nMAN This one was under the windshield of my car. \nElijah turns and faces the customers for the first time. David Dunne stands with Jeremy. \nElijah just stands staring for the longest time. Beat. He walks closer to them. When Elijah speaks, his voice has a whispery quality to it. \nELIJAH You've never been sick? \nDAVID I don't know for sure. (beat) ...I don't think so. \nDavid and Elijah quietly look at each other. Beat. \nELIJAH Well if this ain't a riddle worthy of the Riddler? \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LIMITED EDITION - LATE AFTERNOON \nThree chairs have been placed on the walkway in front of the bay window of the store. The words, \"Limited Edition\" are etched in the window. \nDavid, Jeremy and Elijah are seated watching the people stroll by. Elijah's cane is on his lap. \nJeremy sips a drink in a paper cup. \nELIJAH So let's get some of the usual questions out of the way. Why am I using a cane? Raise your hand if you were thinking that. \nJeremy raises his hand. \nELIJAH I fractured my leg. It's the fifth time I've done that particular bone. It didn't really heal well this time. \nELIJAH Raise your hand is you're wondering who the hell breaks the same bone five times? \nJeremy and David raise their hands. \nELIJAH I have something called Osteogenesis Imperfecta. It's a genetic disorder. I don't make this particular type of protein very well and it makes my bones very low in density, very easy to break. I've had fifty-four breaks in my life. I have the tamest version of the disorder... Type one. (beat) There are type two, type three, and type four. Type four's don't make it very long... (beat) That ends our lecture on the medical anomaly known as Elijah Price. \nElijah stares at his two rapt listeners. \nDAVID I see guys like you all the time in my work. You find someone you think is emotionally vulnerable and you tell them a fantastic story, utterly convincing... and somewhere in there, you slip it in... 'I just need your credit card number','I just need a small down payment.' \nDavid shakes his head. He smiles out of frustration. Beat. \nDAVID Did you know that this morning was the first morning I can remember, that I didn't open my eyes and feel that sadness... Do you know what I'm talking about? That little bit of sadness? (beat) I thought the person that wrote that note had an answer for me. For why I survived that train. For why my life feels so out of balance... (beat) But I guess that's what you were counting on. \nElijah stares carefully at David. Beat. David glances over to the entrance. Jeremy watched through the window concerned. \nDAVID I'm going to leave now. (beat) Good luck with your sale. \nElijah watches David walk towards the front door. \nELIJAH What type of job do you have David? \nDavid opens the door. He looks back at Elijah. \nELIJAH You mentioned you've met 'guys like me' in your work. (beat) What type of job would that be? \nBeat. \nDAVID I work at the stadium as a security guard. \nBeat. David closes the door behind him. Elijah watches through the window as Jeremy takes David's hand as they cross the street. \nElijah gazes out the window in a bit of a daze. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BEDROOM - NIGHT \nALL LIGHTS ARE OUT EXCEPT THE SMALL BEDSIDE LAMP ON DAVID'S SIDE. \nDavid sits up in bed staring at a torn section of newspaper in his hands. \nJeremy is asleep horizontally with his legs over David's legs. \nDavid doesn't blink as he gazes at the headline silently... \n\"TRAIN CRASH DEATH TOLL CONFIRMED AT 131 DEAD. 1 SURVIVOR\" \nBeat. David slides out from under his son's legs. Jeremy stirs but doesn't wake up. \nDavid moves to the darkness of the corner of the room. He opens a closet door. \nA NAKED HANGING BULB GOES ON as David yanks a chain. David steps inside the narrow closet and closes the door slightly so the LIGHT FROM THE BULB DOESN'T FALL ON JEREMY. \nThere's just enough room to stand and look around. David reaches up and pulls a small travel bag out of the way. David stretches as he feels on the top shelf. \nHis hand comes down with something wrapped in a t-shirt. He unwraps it. It's a handgun. \nHe stares at it for a beat before wrapping it back up and replacing it to the highest shelf. \nHe stretches even more. Reaches farther back. WE HEAR SOMETHING SLIDE ON THE SHELF AS HE PULLS IT FORWARD. \nHe pulls down a folder jammed with clippings. He opens the folder to reveal a young David in football uniform holding his helmet in the air victoriously. The word \"Champion\" is written over his head. David flips through the top clippings - all are images and stories of David and football. \nHe turns the pile over. Goes to the last clipping. This piece of paper is folded over three times, unlike the others. He opens it. \nIt's a newspaper headline. It reads... \n\"CAR ACCIDENT LEAVES TWO INJURED\" \nDavid puts the new headline next to the old one... They look like a set. Even the font is similar. \nDavid stares at the old headline. Stares hard at the photo of the bent and heavily damaged car laying upside down in the middle of the highway... The bulb seems to flicker. David is utterly still. \nSOMEONE KNOCKS AT THE BEDROOM DOOR. David gets startled. \nHe puts back the clippings. Stuffing the new one inside with them. He replaces it back to the top shelf and leaves the closet. \nANOTHER SOFT SET OF KNOCKS as David moves across the bedroom. He opens the door. \nMegan stands in the darkened hall. Beat. \nDAVID(whisper) Hi. \nMegan nods. Beat. \nMEGAN(whisper) I've come to a decision. \nDAVID(whisper) Oh. \nBeat. \nMEGAN(whisper) Let me just ask you something okay? And you can be totally honest. I'm prepared for any answer. It won't affect me... \nBeat. Elijah smiles. \nELIJAH That last part was a joke. \nDavid fights it. But he smiles anyway. Beat. \nDAVID I got this job because my college coach called the guy who manages the stadium. There's no hidden meaning to it. \nDavid's walkie makes NOIES on his hip. \nDAVID They need me at the gate. \nDavid stares at Elijah leaning on his walking stick. \nDAVID Did you really want to see the game? I can get you in. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ENTRANCE GATE 27B - AFTERNOON \nThe line of fans outside the gate has tripled in size and intensity. \nDavid and Elijah move along the line towards the turnstiles. \nDAVID It gets heaviest ten minutes before kickoff. \nDavid bumps a guy in line wearing an army jacket. David looks backs at him and continues walking. \nDavid moves to a security guard near the turnstiles. \nDAVID Why don't we pat down? \nDavid walks to his post near the gate and faces the crowd. Elijah moves next to him. \nDAVID Just give me a minute. \nELIJAH Is there a problem? \nDAVID That guy in green. Sometimes people carry weapons in here. Then they drink too much. They're team isn't doing so well, bad things happen... We do random pat downs of the crowd to discourage people from carrying. (beat) If he's carrying, he'll step out of line. \nElijah observes as a security team pats down random males as they move through the turnstiles. \nThe GREEN ARMY JACKETED MAN moves forward in the line. His face is blank as he watches the pat down ahead of him. He's twenty people from the turnsstile. \nDavid eyes him. Fifteen people away... Ten... \nThe man coughs and steps out of the line. Elijah watches the green army jacket melt into the thick part of the crowd and disappear as it moves away from the stadium. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STADIUM TUNNEL - AFTERNOON \nAN UNLIT arched concrete passageway. The SUNLIGHT from the stadium streams in causing long shadows. \nElijah stands waiting in the ground tunnel by himself. \nTHE THUNDEROUS CHEERS OF THE SIXTY THOUSAND FANS IN THE STADIUM ECHOES FROM THE FIELD INTO THE TUNNEL. \nDavid enters the tunnel and joins Elijah. He hands him a ticket. \nDAVID I got you a seat in the seven hundred level. (points straight up) It's nose-bleed territory, but at least you won't get spit on. \nELIJAH How did you know that man you bumped was carrying a weapon? \nDAVID Probably the army jacket. Those guys carry hunting knives and stuff for show. \nELIJAH You thought he was carrying a knife? \nBeat. \nDAVID I thought he was carrying something. \nELIJAH But not a knife? \nDAVID I got this picture of a silver handled gun tucked in his pants. (beat) Like on t.v. \nElijah stares at David. THE STADIUM CHEERS BOUNCE OFF THE GRAY WALLS. \nELIJAH You have good instincts when it comes to things like that? \nDAVID Like what? \nELIJAH Telling when people have done something wrong? \nBeat. \nTHE SOUND OF A SUBWAY PULLING IN ROARS UP THE STAIRS. \nElijah has to move fast. He takes the steps with less and less hesitation. He's moving with great agility... and then his foot catches on a step. \nHis hand slips away from the railing... \nHe falls down the remaining part of the stairs. The FIRST SICKENING CRACK is heard when his hand reaches out to stop his fall. \nThe SECOND CRACK IS MORE LIKE A CRUNCH AS HIS LEG LANDS AWKWARDLY ON THE METAL STAIRS. \nHe comes to a stop in a pile on the dirty gum stained floor of the subway landing. His jaw is locked in a HORRIFIC SCREAM THAT GETS EATEN BY THE ROAR OF THE SUBWAY TRAIN PULLING IN. \nHis contorted anguished face sees the turnstiles of the subway upside down. The green army jacketed man looks back at Elijah with a blank expression pushing through the turnstile. \nThe last thing Elijah sees before he blacks out, is the tail of the man's coat riding up as he move through the turnstile. The SILVER HANDLE OF A GUN peeks out from the belt of his pants. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BUS STOP - DUSK \nDavid's neighborhood turns crimson as the day comes to an end. The Septa bus pulls to a stop in front of a public high school. David steps off, still in his security clothes. The bus pulls away as he hears his SON'S VOICE. \nDavid turns to the high school football field behind him. A group of children are having a touch football game. Jeremy runs out from the huddle across the field to David. \nJEREMY Was it sold out? \nDavid nods, \"No.\" \nDAVID You know how mad your mom would be if she knew you were playing football? \nJeremy nods. \nJEREMY Are you going to tell? \nDavid nods, \"No.\" \nJEREMY You want yo play the last downs? We got a big guy like you. You can play on opposite sides. \nDavid looks to the fields to see a very muscular college age man in sweats who stands with the other children. \nJEREMY He's Potter's cousin. He's the starting corner back for Temple University. \nDavid stares at his son. \nJEREMY He going pro in the draft. They say he can run the fifty- \nDAVID In under six seconds. (beat) I've heard. \nDavid watches the cornerback being surrounded by kids. He's letting a couple of the kids feel his flexed bicep. \nDAVID I'm going to go in. \nJEREMY Just play one set of downs. I told them you were great. \nDAVID Why'd you do that? \nJEREMY Just one- \nDAVID Jeremy. (beat) I'm going in. I have to do some things. \nJEREMY What things? \nDAVID I'm going to work out. \nJEREMY I'll help you. \nDAVID There's nothing to do. \nJeremy turns back to the children and waves. \nJEREMY(yells) I can't play! I'm working out with my dad! \nJeremy turns back to his father and takes his hand. David looks down at his son who waits patiently. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING \nThe basement is dominated by storage boxes and Christmas decorations. An old bench press and weights are in a cluttered corner. \nDavid sits and turns at the end of the bench as Jeremy laboriously carries and places fifteen a pound weight on the bar. David talks over his shoulder. \nDAVID Why don't you rest now? I'll take it from here. You've been a big help. \nJeremy goes to the opposite side of the bar and starts to put on another weight. \nDavid's fingers wrap around the cold metal of the bar. He leans his head forward and looks to Jeremy. \nDAVID Why don't you move back a bit? Just to be safe. \nJeremy moves back to the bottom of the stairs leading up to the house. He waits. \nAnother deep breath as David heaves. The weight CLINKS as it comes off the arm rest. David is full out straining now as he lowers and raises it. His arms begin to tremble as he lifts it for the second time. BANG the weight lands back safely onto the rest. \nDavid sits up. He looks at his son whose eyes are wide. Beat. \nJEREMY More? \nBeat. David nods, \"Yes.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING \nAn enormous amount of black discs sits on the bar. David's hands are gripping the metal. \nHe talks to Jeremy who stands in his position at the bottom of the stairs without looking at him. \nDAVID You should never try anything like this. You know that right? \nJeremy nods, \"Yes.\" \nDAVID What do you do if something happens? \nJEREMY(soft) Get mom. \nDavid nods, \"yes\" before starting his deep breathing. He takes one last breath. CLINK the weights comes off the rest. His arms are trembling immediately now. His face is locked in a grimace as he brings the bar down to his chest and back up again two times before dropping it onto the armrest. \nHe slowly sits up. \nDAVID How many did you put on that time? \nJEREMY(soft) All of it. \nDAVID There's no more left? \nJeremy nods, \"no\" in a slight daze. Beat. David looks around his basement. \nDAVID What else can we use? \nCUT TO: \nINT. BASEMENT - EARLY EVENING \nA set of two unopened MAB satin finish paint cans are dangling by their metal handles on the outside of each side of the weights. \nThe fours cans sway a little as the bar is heaved off of David's chest. His arms are shaking hard. He raises the weight to it's apex and brings it down again. It touches his chest and rises up again. David's red strained face exhales powerfully as he straightens his arms. \nThe bar lands on the armrest with A CRASH. The paint cans make METAL SQUEAKS as they swing to stillness, one at a time. Beat. \nDavid sits up and turns back to the weights. His mouth moves as he calculates the discs and the cans. \nHis lips stop moving. Beat. \nJEREMY(soft) How much is it? \nDavid doesn't react. \nJEREMY(soft) How much is it dad? \nIt takes a second for David to register the question. He looks to his son. Beat. \nDAVID(soft) About three hundred and forty. \nDavid turns and looks at his son. Jeremy's mouth is slightly open. He gazes at his dad. Awe in his tiny eyes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - EVENING \nDavid sits on the edge of the bathroom tub. He's just showered and wearing jeans and a t-shirt. He sits still with his elbows resting on his knees, staring at the white tiles of the floor. \nTHE PHONE RINGS. \nDavid gets up and walks out of the bathroom. He picks up the phone and stands in the bathroom doorway. \nDAVID Yeah, hello. \nWOMAN(on phone) Is David Dunne there? \nBeat. \nClaire looks to Megan. \nCLAIRE(soft) I am so sorry. \nMegan nods. \nClaire quietly walks away form the table and joins her group as they leave the restaurant. Beat. \nMegan and David are the last one's left. They sit silently in their booth. Megan looks at David's face. He's shaken. \nHe slowly takes a sip of water and then taps his mouth with napkin. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nIt's late. NO LIGHTS ARE ON EXCEPT THE ONE IN THE HALL. The babysitter has black dyes hair and Buddy Holly glasses. David waits as she puts on her jacket. \nDYED HAIR GIRL He ate about six of those chocolate covered doughnut holes with his milk. He said he only had three, but I know he had six. \nDAVID Okay. \nDavid is not paying attention to the girl. He watches as his wife takes off her coat and heads to the guest room. She turns before entering the room. David and his wife make eye contact. \nMEGAN(soft) Goodnight. \nDavid nods. Megan goes into her room. The guest door closes softly. \nDavid finds the babysitter looking at him with an odd expression. \nDYED HAIR GIRL My parents sleep in separate beds. \nDavid reaches into his wallet and hands the girl money. \nDAVID Thank you. \nDavid opens the front door for her. \nDYED HAIR GIRL By the way, Jeremy went to sleep in his room tonight. \nDAVID His room? \nThe baby sitter nods with a smile as she walks out the front door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM \nDavid walks into the darkened child's bedroom. The lump on the bed turns when he hears movement. He smiles when he sees David. \nJEREMY(whispered) I'm sleeping in my room. \nDAVID(soft) I see. \nJEREMY(whispered) I'm not scared. \nDAVID(soft) That's great. \nJEREMY(whispered) Do you know why? \nDavid nods, \"No.\" \nJEREMY(whispered) I know now. \nDAVID(soft) Know what? \nJEREMY(whispered) You're secret identity. (beat) That man was right. \nBeat. David just stares at his son. Jeremy's eyes start to close. \nDAVID Jeremy. \nJeremy opens his eyes. \nDAVID(soft) There are big guys in almost every gym who can lift that much. \nBeat. Jeremy's eyes start to shut. \nJEREMY(whispered) You could have lifted more. (his eyes close) ...Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. \nJeremy Dunne falls asleep. David Dunne stands in the darkness of his son's room. Posters of comic book heroes don the walls around him. \nCUT TO: \nINT. HOSPITAL ROOM - NIGHT \nAnd then, without any fanfare, the bar lifts off the arm rest. \nThe weight hovers over David. He lowers it to his chest for a second time. His arms aren't shaking anymore. He pushes the weights back up. \nHe carefully brings the bar back to the arm rest. It touches down with the smallest of CLINKS. \nDavid's fingers uncurl from the bar. \nDavid lets out two slow soft breaths as he counts the thick black discs. \nDAVID(whispers) Four ten... four forty-five... (beat) Five hundred. \nBeat. David sits up in a daze. \nHe finds the entire room of athletes and trainers staring at him. Some of the players have stood up. Everyone stares as David Dunne with the same quiet disbelief in their eyes. \nCUT TO: \nINT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - AFTERNOON \nMegan and Elijah are in the far corner of the room. They're separated from the other clients. Megan is seated on an exercise machine. Elijah is in his wheel chair facing her. \nMEGAN We're going to prevent any substantial atrophy of your good leg with this. (She taps the machine) It works the quadriceps. \nELIJAH How long have you been married? \nMegan is taken off guard by the question. She stares at Elijah. Beat. \nMEGAN Twelve years. \nELIJAH How did you get together? \nElijah smiles warmly. Megan smiles softly back. \nMEGAN A car accident. \nElijah smiles even bigger. \nELIJAH Now you're going to have to tell me more. \nMEGAN ...See my husband was a big football star in college and we were in an accident together. Our car flipped on an icy road. We were both injured. He couldn't play football anymore. (beat) If that hadn't happened, we wouldn't have been together. \nELIJAH How so? \nMEGAN Football wasn't the kind of life I wanted... For ten years I'd be by the phone waiting for a call telling me he broke his neck in a practice game. And if it wasn't that call, it would be a call telling me he blew out his knee or suffered his third concussion. I've seen way too much of it in my job... I can barely take it when my clients are in pain. (beat) I don't hate the game. I admire the amount of skill it involved and, like everyone else, I was in awe of how he could play it, but I couldn't give him my heart and then have something happen to him. And it always does with that game. (beat) It's not a thing many people would understand. \nELIJAH You and my mother would have a special connection. \nMEGAN Any way, fate stepped in and took football out of the equation. \nELIJAH ...And everyone lived happily ever after. \nBeat. \nMEGAN Sort of. \nBeat. \nELIJAH What part of David's body was injured? \nBeat. Megan's eyes become utterly still. \nMEGAN Who said my husband's name is David? \nCUT TO: \nINT. STADIUM - AFTERNOON \nEleven football players in white and green battle eleven football players in blue and gray on the field. A sold out stadium watches the event. \nDavid stands at the lip of a tunnel that opens out onto the upper section of the second level. Waves of people move from their seats through the tunnel to the bathrooms and concession stands and back again. \nDavid stares to the side away from the movement, his shoulder leaned up against the wall. He looks over at the constant movement of spectators through the tunnel. \nBeat. His shoulder leaves the wall. He STEPS OUT into the stream of people. Shoulders and arms bump into him and brush by him as they move. \nDavid's eyes are looking down - his expression still - like he's listening. \nHe continues into the dead center of the tunnel. He's in the heaviest part of the movement now. Fans continue to brush against him as they pass. \nAnd then it happens... A stocky woman bumps into him. \nFLASH CUT: AN IMAGE OF THE STOCKY WOMAN IN A BATHROBE STANDING IN A KITCHEN. SHE'S HOLDING THE SHOULDER OF A FIVE YEAR OLD BOY STANDING NEXT TO HER. HE'S CRYING UNCONTROLLABLY. \nTHEY BOTH ARE LOOKING DOWN AT THE KITCHEN TABLE WHERE THREE THINGS ARE LAID OUT... A BELT, A HANGER, AND AN EXTENSION CORD. \nThe gray eyed man in the blue sweat shirt turns and starts down the stairs to his seat. He raises his fist in the air as someone scores a touchdown on the field. \nCUT TO: \nINT. ELEMENTARY SCHOOL NURSE'S RECEPTION AREA - AFTERNOON \nJeremy is seated in a chair with abrasions and cuts on his face. He sits next to a smaller boy with a thermometer in his mouth. \nThey're both looking at the glass window of the nurse's private office. There are tow people inside talking. David and A WHITE HAIRED NURSE. \nThe THERMOMETER BOY pulls the thermometer out of his mouth. \nTHERMOMETER BOY Is that your dad? \nJeremy nods \"Yes.\" \nTHERMOMETER BOY I bet my dad can beat up you dad. \nJeremy turns to the thermometer boy. \nJEREMY I don't think so. \nCUT TO: \nINT. NURSE'S OFFICE - AFTERNOON \nNURSE ...No, he insisted we only call you. (beat) Though it took us a while to track down your number. It's not on file here. \nDAVID Megan handles that type of stuff. \nNURSE What stuff is that? \nDAVID Jeremy's stuff. \nDavid feels uncomfortable as the nurse just stares at him. Beat. David rises from his seat. \nDAVID So do I need to put any smelly ointments on him or anything? \nThe white haired nurse nods, \"no.\" \nNURSE It's more emotional damage. It wasn't very serious physically. \nDavid nods. \nNURSE Nothing like when I sent you to the hospital. \nDavid stares at the white haired nurse. \nDAVID What was that? \nNURSE My office was on the other side of the building back then. (beat) You don't remember me do you? \nDavid nods, \"no.\" \nNURSE I had red hair. \nDavid stares at the woman. He doesn't recognize her. \nNURSE I think you were a little younger than Jeremy when it happened. (beat) Did you know we changed the conduct rules of the pool because of you? \nDavid nods, \"no\" slowly. \nNURSE The kids still talk about it like some ghost story...\"Did you know there was a kid that almost drowned in the pool? He got pneumonia and almost died.\" \nThe nurse shakes her head. \nNURSE We let them tell it... It helps keep them safe. \nBeat. \nNURSE Are you still phobic of water? \nDavid seems lost in his thoughts. He looks up at the nurse. \nDAVID Yes I am. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BUS STOP - AFTERNOON \nDavid and Jeremy are seated on a bench at a Septa bus stop. No one else is waiting with them. \nJeremy talks without making eye contact with his dad. \nJEREMY(soft) It was Potter and another guy I play football with. They were messing with this Chinese girl. She's kind of fat. She doesn't talk to anybody. (beat) I tried to make them stop. They kept pushing me down and wouldn't let me get up. \nJeremy stops moving. \nDAVID -That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me. \nJEREMY(crying) -You're lying. \nDAVID -I'm not. I just didn't connect it. \nMEGAN -Jeremy, your father was injured in college - you know that. You know all about that. \nJeremy's small face tenses. Confusion mixes with the desperation on his face. \nMEGAN -Don't do it. He'll die Jeremy. \nBeat. Jeremy looks up, tears streaming down his cheeks. \nJEREMY(crying) -I'll just shoot him once. \nDAVID -Jeremy listen to what- \nJeremy starts pressing the trigger. The hammer clicks back. \nJEREMY -Don't be scared. \nDAVID -Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York. \nJeremy freezes. David flashes a desperate glance at Megan then back to Jeremy. \nDAVID You're right... If you shoot me, that bullet is going to bounce off me and I won't get hurt... but then I'm going to go upstairs and pack. And then leave to New York. \nBeat. \nJEREMY(crying) -Why? \nJeremy's hands are trembling. He starts to close his eyes as he raises the gun level with David's chest. \nDAVID(loud) Jeremy! \nJeremy's eyes open. \nDAVID(loud) You're about to get into big trouble! I'm your father and I'm telling you to put that gun down right now God damn it! (beat) One!... (beat) Two!... \nJeremy puts the gun down on the floor in front of him and stands up. \nMegan leans against the refrigerator and slides down to a sitting position on the tiled floor. \nDavid walks over and picks up the gun. He unloads the bullets in his hand. David bends down very slowly and takes a seat on the kitchen floor. \nJeremy is the last to sit down. He takes a seat in the doorway of the kitchen. Beat. He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand. Beat. \nJEREMY(soft) ...You didn't have to yell. \nThe Dunne family sits in silence on the floor of their kitchen. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON \nPeople move up and down the streets outside the storefronts. David is one of them. He waits to cross the street. He sees movement inside the Limited Edition window. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON \nElijah opens the door. It takes him a bit, because of the wheelchair. \nDavid stares at Elijah's damaged condition. Beat. \nELIJAH Joined a rugby league. Turned out to be a bad idea. (beat) Come here I want to show you something. \nElijah wheels over to one of the framed sketches on the wall. It's a charcoal drawing of a muscular figure shielding himself from a blow about to be delivered. A huge ominous shadow is covering him, as if something unspeakable and evil is just out of frame. \nELIJAH Look at this. I just noticed this today. \nDavid steps in close and studies the drawing. \nELIJAH This is from the Sentryman series. A color version of this was actually used in the second issue. \nElijah points up to the drawing's face. \nELIJAH Look at this eyes. What do you see? \nDavid looks right at the intense eyes of the drawing. \nELIJAH It's fear. (beat) He was scared. They were being honest in the beginning you see. They let him be human. (beat) They turned him into a garden variety hero later... Then he was brave all the time. \nINT. DOWNTOWN COMIC BOOK STORE - NIGHT \nAn overweight man in sweats and a ponytail counts the cash in the register. We are in a low-end comic book store. The walls are lined with shelves of comic books. The more expensive issues are kept in a glass case. \nTHE PONYTAIL MAN looks at his watch and then to far back of the store where one head is visible behind a low rack. \nPONYTAIL MAN Hey man it's twenty after. It's time to close. I gotta head. \nThe top of the man's head doesn't move. Beat. \nPONYTAIL MAN You better not be jacking off to the Japanese comics. I swear to God. \nNo response. Ponytail man closes his register and walks towards the back. \nAs he gets closer to the customer, he realizes that the man is in a wheelchair. The Ponytail man walks ups to Elijah. \nPONYTAIL MAN Listen man, I didn't know you were in- (beat) Just choose something all right? \nElijah doesn't react. He sits in his chair in a quiet daze. Ponytail man leans over. \nPONYTAIL MAN Hello. You understand English? \nPonytail man makes fake sign language gestures in front of Elijah's face. \nPONYTAIL MAN Look man, I'm just gonna wheel you out. You can think about things outside on the sidewalk. I gotta get some chicken in me, you know what I'm saying? \nBeat. The Ponytail man shakes his head moves behind Elijah. He starts wheeling him towards the front of the store. They move down a narrow aisle of comics. \nElijah suddenly grabs the left wheel and turns the chair. His immobilized left leg hits a rack of comic books. A handful of comics tumbles to the ground. \nPONYTAIL MAN Shit. \nThe ponytail man straightens the wheelchair and starts down the aisle again. After a couple of feet, Elijah jerks and grabs the other wheel sending the wheelchair ramming violently into the opposite wall. Comics are knocked free and fall onto the wheel chair and the nearby ground. \nPONYTAIL MAN Dude, I don't care if you are in a wheelchair. If you do that again, I'm calling Five-O. \nBeat. The Ponytail man takes Elijah's silence as a, \"Yes.\" He straightens the chair. \nThey move down the aisle. All is quiet... and then Elijah jerks the wheelchair to the left again. His metal brace and the wheelchair crash into two racks. Elijah gets covered in comics. \nPONYTAIL MAN That's it crackerjack! You're going to sit your ass in jail now. \nThe Ponytail man moves to the front counter. \nElijah sits in a trance - slightly hunched over. His eyes stare at a comic book in his lap. His expression changes for the first time. \nThe Ponytail man finishes dialing. He looks over to Elijah as he waits for a voice on the other end. Elijah raises a single comic book in his hand. \nELIJAH How much is this one? \nCUT TO: \nINT. RESTAURANT BAR - NIGHT \nLATE EVENING. A trendy restaurant. Not enough light to read the menus. \nDavid and Megan are on stools at one end of the bat. They sip their drinks as they appear in deep thought. \nDAVID ...I think rust. \nMEGAN Rust? \nDAVID As a color, not as rust. You know, a rust colored paint or wood? \nMegan leans slightly closer. \nMEGAN I didn't know that. Mine's still brown. \nDAVID My turn. What's your favorite song? \nMEGAN Soft and Wet, by the Artist Formerly Known as Prince. \nDAVID What was that? \nMEGAN We're supposed to be honest. \nBeat. David brings his stool closer. \nDAVID Soft and Wet. That's very interesting. \nMEGAN My turn.

KITCHEN - NIGHT \nOnly the COUNTER LIGHT is on in the kitchen. David stands by the phone. \nELIJAH'S VOICE IS HEARD ON THE ANSWERING MACHINE. \nELIJAH(on tape) ...David. It's Elijah. It was so obvious. It's referred to over and over. That's the key you see. The repetition across time. That means at some point it was all based on common thought, a common event - a fact. (beat) It was this one issue that brought it back for me... Century Comics One-Seventeen. That's where this group, the Coalition of Evil, tried to ascertain the weakness of every superhero. \nELIJAH(on tape) ...Because they all have one. (beat) Just like you. (beat) The cells that make up your muscles and your bones react to forces that act upon it, slightly different from than mine. That's clear... Your cells react to bacteria and viruses slightly differently than mine... That's also clear...But for some reason, you and I react the exact same way to water. We swallow it, we choke. We swallow too much of it, we drown. However unreal it may seem, we are connected, you and I, we are on the same curve... just on opposite ends. \nELIJAH The point of all this is, we now know something we didn't... You have a weakness... Water. It's your krpytonite. (beat) You hearing me David? Call me back... I got rugby practice in an hour. \nTHE SOUND OF ELIJAH HANGING UP IS HEARD. THE ANSWERING MACHINE BEEPS AS IT TURNS OFF. \nDavid hits a button on the answering machine. It makes a WHIRRING SOUND before ANNOUNCING. \nMACHINE Message erased. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nThe master bedroom is very narrow. A bathtub and toilet are at one end. Two identical sinks sit opposite each other. \nDavid sits on the edge of the tub. His shirt is unbuttoned. He sits in a daze staring at the tiled floor. \nHis eyes slowly move to a small white and red box laying on its side under one of the sinks. \nDavid rises and picks it up. \nIt's a BOX OF BAND AIDS. David looks up to Megan's sink. Perfume and lotions sit on its edge. \nDavid opens her mirrored cabinet. He starts to put the band aid box back, he hesitates. \nHis eyes begin to roam the cabinet shelves. They stop on certain items... A CONTAINER OF TYLENOL... A LOTION FOR DRY SKIN... A BOTTLE OF ALLERGY DROPS... COUGH SYRUP...  A TUBE OF MUSCLE PAIN OINTMENT... \nDavid just stands quietly for a beat before turning and looking across to his own identical mirrored medicine cabinet. \nThere are three things on the shelf... DISPOSABLE RAZORS. SHAVING CREAM. AND COLOGNE. \nDavid's mouth opens just a little bit as he stares. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT \nALL THE LIGHTS ARE OUT. \nDavid moves through the darkness down the stares in jeans and a sweatshirt. \nHe moves to the coat closet. Pulls out the dark green rain poncho. The word \"security\" is almost faded away. \nHe opens and closes the front door with virtually NO SOUND. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION - NIGHT \nRain falls like gunfire from the sky. \nDavid's car pulls into the massive rain station parking lot. \nDavid steps out and pulls the hood of the poncho over his head. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. METAL STAIRS - NIGHT \nA steel fence leads to a set of stairs that travel down to the dozens of interconnected tracks below. David walks down about forty feet. A fenced gate with a lock stops his progress. \nDavid looks through the fence down to the tracks. Just to the side is a construction site. Cranes and lifts and various equipment stand idle in the area next to the section of train wreckage that has been brought to the station grounds for dismantling and salvaging. The bent shapes of the train pieces can only be glimpsed in outlines as they sit in the darkness, hundreds of feet away from the immaculately lit train station. \nBeat. A HUGE METALLIC CRACK ECHOES THROUGH THE TRAIN YARD as David kicks open the fence door that holds him back from going down. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. TRAIN WRECKAGE - NIGHT \nFrightening twisted pieces of metal glisten in the rain. David walks along the body of the caved-in passenger car. \nThe passenger car is split in two. Just before the tear, along the window line, the windows have been crushed in. A huge hole has been ripped below the windows exposing the ravaged interior. \nDavid stands before this heavily damaged area of the car. He just stares at the wreckage. Water falls off the rim of his hood in front of his face. \nHis eyes drift over the ominous pieces of deformed metal. He takes a couple slow breaths as THE SOUNDS OF HARSH RAIN FADE AWAY TO SILENCE. \nDavid sits on the edge of the empty bed in the darkness of his room. \nHe doesn't makes a sound. He doesn't move an inch. He is so still, he seems to disappear into the shadows of the room. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GUEST BEDROOM - NIGHT \nMegan stirs in her sleep. She shifts her head on the pillow. \nThen her body RISES INTO THE AIR. \nShe starts to wake as she floats across the room. She opens her eyes and sees David close by. He's carrying her in her arms. He moves up the stairs with her. No words are spoken. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THEIR BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThey enter their bedroom. David lays her down gently on her side of the bed. \nShe watches as he walks out of sight. He lays down right behind her. \nHe covers her with his arm... His hand is shaking. Beat. He speaks softly. \nDAVID(soft) I had a bad dream. \nDavid tucks his head in close to hers and closes his eyes. \nMegan lays stunned in her husband's arms. Beat. \nMEGAN(soft) It's over now. \nShe closes her eyes too as the tears start coming. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nDowntown Philadelphia. \nPeople move up and down the sidewalks in front of the storefronts. David Dunne is among them. \nHe crosses the street in front of The Limited Edition. The front doors of the store are open. \nA banner over the door reads, \"Annual Sale.\" \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIMITED EDITION - DAY \nThe compact store is crowded with customers. \nDavid spots Elijah with a group of people before a framed painting of a comic hero. \nDavid moves to a less crowded area of the store and waits. He turns and looks at a framed sketch. \nBeat. An older woman walks over from a near by picture and joins David. \nWOMAN ...See the villain's eyes. They're larger than the other characters'. They insinuate a slightly skewed perspective of how they see the world. Just off normal. \nDavid stares at the drawing. \nDAVID He doesn't look very threatening. \nWOMAN That's what I said to my son. He said, there's always two kinds. The soldier villain who fights the hero with his hands, and then there's the real threat. The brilliant and evil arch enemy who fights the hero with his mind. \nDavid turns and looks at the striking and beautiful African American woman in her sixties who stands next to him. \nDAVID Are you Elijah's mother? \nThe woman turns and looks at David for the first time. \nELIJAH'S MOTHER I am. I'm helping him with the sale. \nDAVID It's a pleasure to meet you. I'm David Dunne. \nELIJAH'S MOTHER He's spoken of you. He says you're becoming friends. \nDAVID We are. \nDavid looks across the store at Elijah talking with the customers. \nDAVID He's doing well today. \nELIJAH'S MOTHER I'm very proud of him. (beat) He's been through a lot in his life. A lot of ups and downs, a lot of bad spells. A couple I'd thought had broken him... I mean emotionally. (beat) They were bad... But he made it. Yes he did. \n", "test1_input": "DAVID(low voice) In the three years we've been in this house?... In the old apartment?... Before Jeremy was born?... Before we were married? \nBeat. \nMEGAN(low voice) ...I can't remember. \nDAVID(low voice) That's strange isn't it? Not remembering one fever... Or a cold... Or a sore throat. What do you think that means? \nMEGAN(low voice) It means we're probably to tired to remember. \nDavid becomes quiet as he thinks. Beat. \nMEGAN(low voice) Is that what you wanted to ask me? \nDAVID(low voice) Yes. \nMEGAN(low voice) Is there anything else you wanted to ask me while I'm up?... \nMEGAN(low voice) ...When was the last time you wore pink? When was the last time you drank soup standing up? Final call for strange questions at two in the morning. \nDAVID(low voice) No that's it. \nDavid seems lost in his thoughts. \nMEGAN(low voice) Maybe you should go up. Jeremy might see you're gone and get frightened. (beat) The train thing, really shook him up. He's scared something's going to happen to you. He doesn't want to let you out of his sight. \nDavid stares at Megan. Beat. \nDAVID(low voice) Yeah. I know. \nThere's silence for a bit. \nDAVID(low voice) When was the last time I wore pink? \nMEGAN(low voice) The Mitchell barbecue three years ago. \nDAVID(realizing) Oh shit... \nMEGAN(low voice) Matching shirt and shorts. It was brutal. \nDavid half-smiles as Megan turns and starts back into the guest room. \nDAVID(low voice) Goodnight Megan. \nMegan looks back at her husband. Just for a moment. Then she looks down. \nMEGAN(low voice) Goodnight David. \nMegan closes the door slowly shut. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT. BEDROOM - AFTERNOON \nWE EMERGE in a cramped sparse bedroom. \nLEGEND \"1974\" \nA thirteen year old Elijah sits in a chair with his arm in a sling. He watches a small black and white television in the corner of the room. \nWE HEAR FOOTSTEPS. Elijah's mother walks into the room. She looks around for a moment, and then moves to the television. Turns it off. \nThe room GOES SILENT. \nELIJAH'S MOTHER No more sitting in this room. I've let it go on long enough. \nELIJAH I'm not going out anymore. I'm not getting hurt again. This was the last time. I told you. \nELIJAH'S MOTHER You can't do anything about that. You might fall between that chair and this television. If that's what God has planned for you, that's what's going to happen. You can't hide from it in your room. \nElijah just sits staring at the dark television screen. \nELIJAH They call me Mr. Glass at school. Cause I break like glass. \nElijah's face is tense. Unyielding. Beat. \nElijah's mother says the next words in almost a whisper. \nELIJAH'S MOTHER ...You make this decision now to be afraid... (beat) And you'll never turn back your whole life. You'll always be afraid. \nElijah's eyes move from the television to his mother. He sees the emotion in her face. Neither says anything for a while.

He nods, \"Yes.\" \nELIJAH'S MOTHER Well, go get it then. \nELIJAH Where is it? \nELIJAH'S MOTHER On a bench, across the street. \nElijah looks at his mother with disbelief. \nELIJAH'S MOTHER You calling me a liar? \nShe points to the window. Beat. Elijah gets up and moves to the only window in the room. \nThe view from his room looks out over a narrow street. On the other side of the street is a public playground. A handful of children are playing on it. \nThere are three benches to one side of the swings. On one of them is a THIN PACKAGE wrapped in brown paper with a bow on it. \nElijah looks to his mom who has joined him at the window. \nELIJAH Someone's gonna take it. \nBeat. \nELIJAH'S MOTHER Then you better get out there soon. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. PLAYGROUND - AFTERNOON \nElijah walks across the playground. He's very wary of the other children running about him. \nHe walks towards the bench with the present on it. Takes a seat. Puts the package on his lap. It's flat. The edges of the bend down over his thin legs. \nHe undoes the white bow. He peels off the clear tape holding the brown paper together. He unfolds the paper. Beat. \nElijah stares down at the single comic book in his lap. \nHe feels the shadow of his mother. She takes a seat next to him. \nELIJAH'S MOTHER I bought a whole bunch. They'll be one of these waiting for you, every time you want to come out here. \nBeat. \nELIJAH'S MOTHER They said this one has a surprise ending. \nElijah looks to his mother. His intelligent piercing eyes take her in for a moment. \nHe looks back down at his lap. He opens the first page... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nINT. STORE - DAY \nThe same intelligent piercing eyes, twenty-five years older. Elijah has grown into a handsome, regal looking man. He leans on a walking stick. \nHe's looking at an impressively framed charcoal sketch on a wall. Two figures are depicted on the top of a building locked in fierce battle. One figure is extremely muscular with a mask. The other is half human, half animal. \nMAN This is from Fritz Champion's own library. This is before the first issue of the comic book hit the stands in 1968. \nElijah glances at the BUSINESS MAN standing next to him and then back to the sketch. \nELIJAH It's a classic depiction of good versus evil. Notice the square jaw of Slayer - common in most comic book heroes. And the slightly disproportionate size of Jaguaro's body to his head. This again is common, but only in villains... The thing to notice about this piece... The thing that makes it very, very special... is its realistic depiction of its figures. When the characters eventually made it into the magazine they were exaggerated... as always happens. (beat) This is vintage. \nThe business man rubs his face. Gazes at the sketch. Beat. \nBUSINESS MAN Wrap it up. \nELIJAH You've made a considerably wise decision. \nElijah starts to the back of the store which we now see is some type of art gallery where all the framed pictures are images and sketches from comic books. \nBUSINESS MAN My kid's gonna go berserk. \nElijah jams his walking stick into the extra thick carpet and stops. He turns. \nELIJAH Once again please? \nBUSINESS MAN My son Jeb. It's a gift for him. \nELIJAH How old is Jeb? \nBUSINESS MAN Four. \nELIJAH No. \n", "test2_input": "Elijah picks up the phone a little out of breath. \nELIJAH Hello. \nDAVID'S VOICE Elijah? \nBeat. \nELIJAH David? \nNothing is said on the other line for a couple of beats. WE HEAR THE ECHOED DIN OF A LARGE ROOM FILLED WITH PEOPLE AND MOVEMENT IN THE BACKGROUND. \nDAVID'S VOICE What am I supposed to do? \nElijah closes his eyes. His face fills with strength. \nCUT TO: \nINT. THIRTIETH STREET STATION PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT \nThe interior of the station is a mystical sight. One huge cavernous room, a football field in size, lined on both sides with giant pillars that rise into a misty hand painted ceiling. \nELIJAH(v.o.) David, it's okay to be afraid. Because this part won't be like a comic book... Real life doesn't fit into little boxes that were drawn for it. \nDavid stands in a quiet corner and watches the faces of passengers arriving and departing late night trains. Even at the late hour, there is heavy traffic throughout the station. \nELIJAH(v.o.) Go to where people are... You won't have to look very long. \nDavid stares out at the midnight travelers. Beat. He starts towards them. \nHe passed the towering black statue standing at the far end of the station. It watches over the whole building. It's in the form of an angel lifting a soldier to heaven. \nDavid moves through the first group of people - a crisscross of arriving passengers from tracks one and two. They brush by him and lightly bump him as they move. \nFLASH CUT: WE ARE NO LONGER IN THE TRAIN STATION. A BLOND WOMAN IN HER TWENTIES STANDS AT A COUNTER IN A CROWDED STORE. \nSHE SLIDES THE SILVER BRACELET AND EARRINGS SHE WAS LOOKING AT OFF THE GLASS COUNTER AND INTO HER PURSE. NO ONE SEES. \nSLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: \nDavid turns and glances at the blonde woman as she walks away from him towards the exit of the train station. He doesn't stop moving. \nDavid heads towards the densest part of the floor. The area near the information board. Sleepy friends and tired family members stand and wait. A steady spider-like web of movement flows as six  tracks let out on either side. \nDavid moves to the center. His rain poncho almost touches the marble floor. Lines of passengers emerging from trains below the main level move steadily on either side of him. \nDavid looks down and gently turns the palms of his hands out as they at his side. His finger tops graze the jackets and clothes of the passengers walking by. \nDozens and dozens of people pass. Nothing happens. Then a man in a crumpled shirt and slicked back hair brushes by... \nFLASH CUT: THE SLICKED BLACKED HAIRED MAN LEANS OUT THE WINDOW OF A TRUCK. HE'S HOLDING A BOTTLE OF BEER. \nSLICKED HAIR MAN Go back to Africa! \nTHE SLICKED HAIR MAN THROWS THE BOTTLE WITH FORCE AS HE PASSES A CLACK FAMILY WALKING ON THE SIDEWALK. THE BOTTLE SHATTERS AS IT HITS A WOMAN IN THE GROUP. \nSLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: \nDavid's eyes dart up as the slicked haired man turns the corner at the information booth. He watches him for a beat. \nFLASH CUT: WE ARE IN A BEDROOM. A YOUNG MAN IN HIS LATE TEENS LOOKS DOWN AT A GIRL LAYING IN A PILE OF OVERCOATS ON A BED. THERE IS LOUD MUSIC AND LAUGHTER COMING FROM SOMEWHERE DOWNSTAIRS. \nTEENAGER What's your name? I think you drank too much. \nTHE GIRL MOANS SOMETHING INAUDIBLE AS SHE ROLLS ON HER SIDE. HER SKIRT RIDES UP HER THIGH. \nTHE YOUNG MAN STARES AT HER AND THEN GETS UP. HE MAKES SURE NO ONE IS LOOKING BEFORE CLOSING THE DOOR. HE LOCKS IT FROM THE INSIDE. \nSLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: \nDavid watches the teenager with baggy jeans hanging off his hip. He walks and greets a group of identically dressed friends. \nBeat. David turns his hands back in. He seems shaken. He takes a couple of deep breaths as he gathers himself. \nThen David steps back to look around. HE BUMPS the shoulder of a man standing behind him. \nDavid takes a sudden breath like someone punched him in the solar plexus. \nFLASH CUT: AN ENORMOUS MAN WITH GLASSY EYES STANDS BEFORE A SCREEN SIDE DOOR. HE'S BALDING. THE HAIR HE DOES HAVE IS SHOULDER LENGTH. HIS ECLIPSING SHADOW FALLS ON THE CONSERVATIVE LOOKING MAN WHO STANDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE SCREEN DOOR INSIDE THE HOUSE. \nGLASSY EYED MAN Can I come in? \nMAN IN HOUSE Who are you? \nGLASSY EYED MAN I like your house. Can I come in? \n", "test2_true": "Beat. \nGLASSY EYED MAN Are you sure? \nThe enormous glassy eyed man takes hold of the screen door handle. He turns it. The man inside the house grabs the door handle on the inside to stop him. \nMAN IN HOUSE What are you doing? \nThe man inside the house uses all his strength to keep the door from opening... It opens slowly anyway. \nSLAM CUT BACK TO PRESENT: \nDavid stands frozen in the train station. His face is almost unreadable. \nDavid is standing less than a foot away from the man he bumped. They're standing shoulder to shoulder. David's eyes slowly move from the ground over his right and then finally onto the man. \nHe's huge. At least three inches taller than David. His shoulders are massive. He's wearing a one piece ORANGE UNIFORM. \nThe man in the orange uniform leans over a trashcan next to him and removes the full trash bag within it. He replaces it with a fresh one. He throws the full trash bag into a gray plastic bin with wheels and starts pushing it. \nDavid watches the man head across the floor towards a double door marked \"Station Maintenance Staff Only\". \nFour identical gray bins sit outside the door. The huge man disappears with his bin inside. \nDavid waits. He just stares hard at the double doors. Nothing happens for the longest time... No one comes out. David makes a decision. He starts towards the doors. \nAnd then they open. \nThe huge glassy eyed man in orange emerges carrying a bag over his shoulder. He's wearing a baseball hat with his uniform now. He heads toward a back exit. \nDavid lets him get about twenty feet away before deciding to follow him. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. RESIDENTIAL STREET - NIGHT \nThe man in the orange uniform walks in the driving rain down a residential city block. Almost all the lights in the middle class homes he's passing are off at this late hour. No one is out walking except him and David Dunne fifty feet behind. \nThe orange figure turns the corner onto a block of modest stand alone homes. The uniformed man walks slower in this block. He looks around carefully as he moves. \nHe turns into a driveway of one of the homes. He stops and pulls a wad of mail out of the mailbox. \nDavid stands with the hood of his security coat covering his head and face. He stands in the shadows and watches silently as the man in the orange uniform looks over his massive shoulder before turning a knob and entering the white paneled house through a familiar side door with a screen on it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LAUNDRY ROOM - NIGHT \nThe side door opens with almost no sound. The hooded figure of David Dunne steps into a narrow laundry room. THE SOUND OF A TELEVISION IS HEARD FROM ANOTHER ROOM. \nA very large pile of unopened mail sits in a mound on the clothes dryer. Two or three days worth. \nDavid shuts the door very slowly. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nTHE SOUNDS OF CHEERING FROM THE TELEVISION IN THE NEXT ROOM SPILL INTO THE KITCHEN. \nDavid stares out from under his hood at the mess. \nCabinets are left open. Empty cans of food sit on the counter with a handful of unwashed dishes. The breakfast table is the eeriest thing in the room. It sits frozen with a plate of half-eaten, now moldy eggs at one setting and two bowls of colorful cereal in another. The cereal has dissolved in the old milk. Two cockroaches are crawling in the bowl. \nDavid moves slowly to a door in the kitchen. It's slightly open. As David gets closer, he shields his face from the strong smell. He pulls the door open quietly. \nA SHAFT OF KITCHEN LIGHTS FALLS DOWN THE STAIRS INTO THE BASEMENT. At the bottom of the stairs is a MAN'S BODY. The same man who answered the door in the flashback lays partly in the shadow, partly in the light. His crumpled tie lies folded over itself on his still chest. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FAMILY ROOM - NIGHT \nA BOXING MATCH BLARES ON THE TELEVISION. Empty beer bottles and coke cans sit in a pyramid on the coffee table. \nDavid steps into the unoccupied room. His movements are slow and tense. \nTHUDS OF HEAVY FOOTSTEPS COME FROM THE CEILING OF THE ROOM. David looks up and follows the SOUND AS IT MOVES AROUND ABOVE HIM. \nDavid moves to the stairs as SOMEONE GETS KNOCKED OUT ON THE TELEVISION. \nCUT TO: \nINT. GIRL'S ROOM - NIGHT \nThree closed doors converge on a landing. David opens the closest one. \n", "test3_input": "It's a young girl's room. Posters of boy bands are on her wall. Clothes are everywhere. The room is empty. \nA NOISE COMES FROM THE HALF OPEN BATHROOM DOOR ATTACHED TO THE BEDROOM. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nA slightly overweight girl, probably fourteen years old is tied by her wrists with a phone cord to the metal towel rack in her bathroom. She sits with her arms pointed upward over her head. He knees tucked up to her chest. \nNext to her is her younger brother. A skinny boy, maybe twelve. He's tied and seated in the same way. \nTheir heads are leaned back against their arms. They're completely listless. Eyes half mast. They watch as the door to the bathroom opens and the dark hooded figure of David Dunne steps in. His long dark slowing rain poncho still dripping water. He stands in the doorway for a moment before moving towards them. \nThey don't react in anyway as David reaches for the phone cord and unties them. They're arms flop to their laps as they gaze up at the figure leaning over them. They boy blinks once slowly. \nDavid takes a step back and stares at them from under his hood. \nDAVID You need to leave now. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nAn exercise bike in the corner of the bedroom has been turned into a clothes hanger long ago. The t.v. across the bed has framed family photos displayed on top of it. \nDavid's shadow passes over them as he moves towards the open bathroom on the other side of the bedroom. \nA woman is tied to the bathroom door handle. She sits on the tiled floor slumped against the door. Her eyes stare blankly at the ground. She has considerable bruises on her face and arms. \nDavid stands before her. \nDAVID(soft) Where is he? \nThe woman doesn't answer, but a SOUND COMES FROM THE SCREEN DOOR nearby. The curtains draping the screen door move with the wind from outside. \nDavid crosses the room and pushes aside the curtain. It leads to a small balcony. An empty lawn chair is the only thing on it. \nDavid steps onto the balcony and looks down. \nThe rain still pours down unmercifully. It comes down on a black tarp that covers a pool in the backyard. \nDavid turns to go back inside. \nA BLURR OF ORANGE ATTACKS HIM. \nThe collision is sudden and explosive. The huge man drives his shoulder into David's chest and takes him off his feet. David's body flips over the railing. \nThe dark green rain poncho flaps in the wind as he falls two stories directly towards the black tarp. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. POOL - NIGHT \nDavid lands on his stomach with a TREMENDOUS SLAP onto the nylon black tarp. \nThere's a thin layer of rain water on the tarp's surface. David is laying on his cheek. Half his face is covered in water. \nBeat. David's exposed eye looks around in a daze. The surface of  the tarp gets pounded by the rain. \nDavid uses his hands to push his body off the tarp. His hands sink into the water as his pressure pushes the tarp down. \nTHE FIRST SOUNDS OF NYLON SLIDING AGAINST CONCRETE START. \nDavid stops pushing. His vision catches the corner of the swimming pool as the tarp slides out from under the sand bags that hold it in place. \nThe tarp sags. David becomes utterly still. THE SOUND CONTINUES ANYWAY. \nOne by one the tarp starts sliding out from under the sand bags all around the edge of the pool. \nAnd then without warning, the tarp caves in. It folds around David as he and the tarp get pulled UNDER THE COLD DARK WATER. \nCUT TO: \nEXT.  UNDER WATER - NIGHT \nDavid's body is tangled in the pool cover. His legs and arms thrash against the constricting black tarp. He's drowning. \nGLIMPSES OF LIGHT FROM THE HOUSE PIERCE THE DARKNESS UNDER WATER. THE BLURRED IMAGE OF A DISTANT FIGURE HIGH ABOVE ON A BALCONY FLICKERS AND DISAPPEARS. \nThe last of the tarp slides out from under the sandbags that old it in place around the edge of the pool. \nThe rain keeps falling. \nThe tarp moves like it's alive underwater. It shifts and wraps David tighter with every movement. \n", "test3_true": "David's only free hand reaches for the light. It catches the silver pole. \nThe tangled mass of David and the tarp are pulled slowly towards the edge of the pool. David's head and shoulders emerge from the darkness. He takes hold of the pool's edge. \nHuge desperate breaths as he pulls his body out from the water and the grasp of the tarp. He hauls himself onto the ground. \nHe sits hunched over in a dark mass, his head down under his hood. The rain poncho covering him like a blanket. Beat. \nHe rises to his feet. The water rushes off of him. His breathing is slowing, calming. \nHe stands in a silhouette from the light of the house. He turns and looks to the two small figures standing near the edge of the pool. \nThe children from the bathroom stand still in the rain. They're holding an aluminum pole with a brush head for cleaning the pool. They stare up at the hooded figure. \nNo one says anything. \nCUT TO: \nINT. MASTER BEDROOM - NIGHT \nThe man in the orange one-piece uniform stands over the woman tied to the door handle of the bathroom. His back is to us. He's drinking from a beer bottle as he looks down at her. \nHe doesn't notice the third presence come into the room. He doesn't hear him move closer. Right behind him. \nThe man in orange takes another sip of his beer, not realizing an arm is reaching over him... He doesn't get to swallow the sip in his mouth. \nDavid Dunne's powerful arm wraps around the man's thick neck. David's hands clamp together like and iron vise. He squeezes. \nThe man's beer bottle crashes to the ground as his neck begins to get crushed. \nDavid yanks back hard, pulls the man off balance. The man's legs push back violently, sending both of them backwards across the room. They come to a hard stop as David's back gets RAMMED INTO THE BEDROOM WALL. \nThe huge man in orange pulls away and then SLAMS DAVID harder against the wall. David's arm remains locked around his throat. \nThe man becomes frantic. His face turning dark red. He clutches at David's arm. He spins, taking David with him into another wall. The IMPACT IS TREMENDOUS. The room shakes. David holds on. His face bent low and hidden under his hood. \nAnd then the man in orange throws a powerful elbow back. It lands hard right in David's side. David groans. The huge man delivers another one. Savage, desperate blows. WE HEAR THE IMPACT OF EACH ONE WITH DAVID'S BODY. And David never lets go. \nThe elbows slow and then stop. The legs of the man in orange start to buckle. \nDavid pulls him back onto his heels. He turns him in a half circle. All of his tremendous weight is hanging from David's arm now. David LETS OUT A YELL AS HE APPLIES ALL HIS STRENGTH. The man's legs stop kicking. \nDavid keeps turning him. The man's body goes completely limp. David's just dragging two hundred and seventy-five pounds of weight in a circle over the carpet now. \nDavid slowly comes to a stop. He stands there with his arm wrapped around the man's neck....The man's limbs dangle down to the ground. Beat. \nDavid's hands let go of each other. His arm slips out from under the man's jaw. The man in orange crumples to the ground like a rag doll. The only SOUND IN THE ROOM IS DAVID'S HEAVY BREATHING. Beat. \nHe moves to the woman slumped against the door. He starts to untie the phone cords that bind her wrists to the handle. He whispers to her. \nDAVID(soft) It's over now. (beat) Your children are fine. They're getting help. \nHe unties her wrists. Her arms stay above her head where they were. \nDAVID(soft) I'm going to go now. \nHe stares at the woman whose eyes stare blankly at him. She sits unnaturally still against the door with her arms above her head. The mascara that has run down her face and dried, has tracks where countless tears have rolled down. \nDavid moves his hand near her mouth and nose. He checks for the feeling of breath against his hand. Beat. \nHe rises up. Removes his hood. David Dunne stands silently in the master bedroom of someone's house and gazes at the dead woman frozen in a slumped position against her bathroom door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT \nThe front door opens to SILENCE. The silhouetted figure of David steps into the darkness of his home. \nCUT TO: \nINT. CLOSET - NIGHT \nThe dark green faded security poncho gets hung back on its hook in the closet next to the family winter coats. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nDavid enters the quiet of Jeremy's room. Jeremy lays sound asleep. David stares down at the shadowy figure of his son. \nHe pulls the blanket over the boy's small shoulder. \nCUT TO: \nINT. DAVID'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \n"}

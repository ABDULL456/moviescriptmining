EMERGENCY RECEPTION AREA - EVENING \nDavid moves through the depressing milky corridors of the hospital. He opens a set of double doors. \nA room crammed with cameras and photographers explodes with movement. \nA CHILD'S VOICE BREAKS THEIR NOISE. \nJEREMY I told you! \nJeremy Dunne pushes forward through the mob of people and cameras. He bursts out and runs to David. He wraps his arms around David's waist. David just stands there, aware that the cameras are catching it all. He's overwhelmed. \nHospital staff and a couple police officers push the media back. \nJeremy tugs David to lean down. He does. \nJEREMY They thought everybody on the train died. \nDavid looks at his son's face. Wipes the tears on his cheek. \nJEREMY I told them they were wrong. \nA woman moves to them. David stands up and faces Megan Dunne. \nJEREMY Mom even cried. \nDavid looks at Megan's eyes. \nJEREMY A lot. \nMegan looks away. \nMEGAN Not a lot. \nThey stand there for a moment. David looks shaken. Jeremy takes hold of his hand. \nJEREMY Let's go home. \nMegan nods. They move to the exit. The pack of cameras and reporters burst to life as they leave the building. They jockey for position to get a last glimpse of David Dunne. \nCUT TO: \nINT. KITCHEN - NIGHT \nDavid eats a bowl of pasta alone in a modest kitchen. He stares at his hand. Opens and closes it slowly. Beat. \nHe rises and puts the bowl away in the sink. \nINT. FRONT HALL - NIGHT \nDavid stops just before rising the stairs. He glances into a bedroom at the bottom of the stairs. The doorway is half open. He makes eye contact with his wife.

Just not this second. \nMEGAN I don't want to drag this out too long for Jeremy. \nDAVID I know. \nBeat. \nDAVID How about in the meantime, you don't sleep in the guestroom anymore?

If you get scared like before, you can come back in here? \nBeat. Jeremy doesn't answer because he's asleep. David rubs his forehead and gets up. He turns on the t.v., low volume, as he moves into the bathroom. \nCUT TO: \nINT. BATHROOM - NIGHT \nHot water rushes over David's face as he stands in the shower. His attention is drawn to the t.v. which is seen through the slightly open bathroom door. \nHe turns off the water to HEAR. \nNEWS ANCHOR(t.v.) ...Derailed approximately seven and half miles outside Philadelphia. It came to rest on its side on the northbound tracks. It is train officials belief that some if not most of the passengers were still alive at this time. \nNEWS ANCHOR(t.v.) The momentary peace lasted only a few seconds. A Boston bound freight train on the northbound tracks was seconds away from passing train 177 when it derailed. The impact happened at about three-fifteen p.m. The first of the two occupied passenger cars was severed in half and sent careening in two directions. The second of the passenger cars was crushed and dragged for four hundred feet. Six crew members were on the freight. One hundred and eighteen passengers and seven crew members were on the passenger train... There is one reported survivor. (beat) Rescue teams will be working for the next forty-eight hours removing bodies and debris. \nDavid steps out of the shower. He sees a glimpse of Jeremy asleep in bed. David shuts the door. Locks it. \nHe gets back into the shower and turns the water back on. \nHe closes his eyes. His face tightens up. He slowly hunches down and takes a seat on the tiled floor of the shower. Water pours over him. Beat. \nHis muscular body begins to shake. Then we realize he's crying. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nEXT. FAIR - DAY \nLEGEND \"1969\" \nA hazy afternoon. A fair has come into town. They have set up in the vast parking lot of the local high school. \nA line of women has formed in front of the portable bathrooms. \nThe striking African American woman we saw giving birth is now standing in line. She is older and somehow more beautiful. \nShe stands with a skinny, almost ethereal looking African American boy. The boy wears a metal brace on his leg. THE EIGHT YEAR OLD ELIJAH holds two oversized stuffed animals in his arms. He looks back over his shoulder as THE SOUND OF VOICES YELLING IN EXCITEMENT FILL THE AIR. His eyes dance over the many colorful rides in the parking lot. \nThe door opens to one of the portable bathrooms. A woman steps out. \nElijah's mother touches his head and enters the three foot square plastic bathroom. She turns back and gives him a look. \nMOTHER We'll play the water pistol game next. \nElijah nods, \"Yes\" happily. \nThe mother closes the cubicle door. Elijah is left alone amongst the line of women. They stare at him blankly. Their eyes moves over his leg brace. Elijah doesn't like it. He moves away from the line. \nA CRESCENDO OF CHEERS RISES IN THE AIR FROM SOMEWHERE IN THE FAIR. Elijah follows the voices. He carries the stuffed animals through the crowds of people. CLICK. CLICK. CLICK. His metal brace sounds as he walks. \nFor a moment, he sees nothing but bodies all around him. \nHe emerges amongst a huddle of teenagers who wait at a turnstile. \nA man in a red and white striped coat takes their tickets and waves them in. \nElijah looks up and sees the sign above the turnstile... \"The Hurricane.\" \nHe watches the teenagers giggle as they each into a grey cup-like seat. They pull the metal bars down in front of them. \nThe man in the red and white stripes leaves the turnstile. \nElijah stares up at the multi-colored sign. Beat. He moves quickly. Ducks under the turnstile and climbs onto the platform. \nElijah finds and empty circular seat. He slips inside the gray metal compartment and sits. He pulls down the rusted metal bar in front of him. \nHe looks around at all the excited faces. His eyes fill with excitement too. \nHis small hands feel the cold metal of the interior of the compartment. His expression changes. \nElijah looks to the stuffed animals in his arms. He presses them to check their softness. He places the stuffed animals on either side of him on the seat. He's wedged in between them. Feels good. \nHe reaches out and touches the hard rusted metal bar in front of him. Elijah looks a little anxious. Beat. \nHe pulls off his sweater and wraps it around the bar. It goes around twice before he ties the arms together. He checks its softness. \nElijah looks around the customized cup-like compartment he sits in. He smiles an eight year old smile of pride. \nAND THEN HE HEARS HIS MOTHER'S VOICE. \nHe searches around and finds her walking in the waves of people. He hears her calling. \n", "test1_id": 1593, "test2_input": "Claire looks to Megan. \nCLAIRE(soft) I am so sorry. \nMegan nods. \nClaire quietly walks away form the table and joins her group as they leave the restaurant. Beat. \nMegan and David are the last one's left. They sit silently in their booth. Megan looks at David's face. He's shaken. \nHe slowly takes a sip of water and then taps his mouth with napkin. \nCUT TO: \nINT. FRONT DOOR - NIGHT \nIt's late. NO LIGHTS ARE ON EXCEPT THE ONE IN THE HALL. The babysitter has black dyes hair and Buddy Holly glasses. David waits as she puts on her jacket. \nDYED HAIR GIRL He ate about six of those chocolate covered doughnut holes with his milk. He said he only had three, but I know he had six. \nDAVID Okay. \nDavid is not paying attention to the girl. He watches as his wife takes off her coat and heads to the guest room. She turns before entering the room. David and his wife make eye contact. \nMEGAN(soft) Goodnight. \nDavid nods. Megan goes into her room. The guest door closes softly. \nDavid finds the babysitter looking at him with an odd expression. \nDYED HAIR GIRL My parents sleep in separate beds. \nDavid reaches into his wallet and hands the girl money. \nDAVID Thank you. \nDavid opens the front door for her. \nDYED HAIR GIRL By the way, Jeremy went to sleep in his room tonight. \nDAVID His room? \nThe baby sitter nods with a smile as she walks out the front door. \nCUT TO: \nINT. JEREMY'S BEDROOM \nDavid walks into the darkened child's bedroom. The lump on the bed turns when he hears movement. He smiles when he sees David. \nJEREMY(whispered) I'm sleeping in my room. \nDAVID(soft) I see. \nJEREMY(whispered) I'm not scared. \nDAVID(soft) That's great. \nJEREMY(whispered) Do you know why? \nDavid nods, \"No.\" \nJEREMY(whispered) I know now. \nDAVID(soft) Know what? \nJEREMY(whispered) You're secret identity.

Jeremy's eyes start to close. \nDAVID Jeremy. \nJeremy opens his eyes. \nDAVID(soft) There are big guys in almost every gym who can lift that much. \nBeat. Jeremy's eyes start to shut. \nJEREMY(whispered) You could have lifted more. (his eyes close) ...Don't worry, I won't tell anyone. \nJeremy Dunne falls asleep.

The worst of the injury, however, was sustained to the left leg in the form of a spiral fracture. There were fourteen breaks. It simply shattered... \nELIJAH They call me Mr. Glass. \nBeat. \nPHYSICIAN(o.s.) Who does? \nELIJAH Kids. \nElijah just keeps staring. \nPHYSICIAN(o.s.) Shall I continue? \nBeat. Elijah's head nods the slightest bit up and down. \nPHYSICIAN(o.s.) Pins were placed throughout the length of the leg. The use of a wheelchair will be needed for a two month period. The use of crutches will follow for twelve to fourteen months. Hospital stay will range from five to eight days followed by nine to twelve months of physical therapy. Prescribed medication for pain management will take the usual forms of... \nThe PHYSICIAN'S WORDS FADE AWAY as Elijah continues to gaze at an abstract point in the room. \nFADE TO BLACK: \nINT. PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER - LATE MORNING \nWE EMERGE FROM DARKNESS TO FIND OURSELVES IN THE PHYSICAL THERAPY CENTER. \nA CO-WORKER finds Megan working with an elderly gentleman who's laboring on a stationary bike. \nJANIS Your ten o'clock is here. The hospital discharged him this morning. \nMEGAN Thanks. \nThe co-worker takes Megan's position by the elderly man. \nMegan crosses the physical therapy center. A man in a wheel chair waits by her office. She walks up to him with a smile. \nMEGAN Elijah right? \nElijah's leg is immobilized by a metal brace and held straight. Under his shirt we see the wrappings around his ribs. His left pinky is in a splint. He smiles and nods, \"yes\" to Megan. \nCUT TO: \nINT. STADIUM LOCKER ROOM - LATE MORNING \nDavid Dunne stands in security uniform by a set of double doors that leads into the players locker room. \nThree walls of the locker room are lined with shiny lockers. One side of the room has benches and massage tables. The far end of the room has work out equipment. \nAbout twenty players and trainers are scattered throughout the spacious room lost in their own pre-game rituals. \nDavid watches as a massive muscular player takes a seat on the massage table and removes his dress shirt. His body is covered in old bruises. He lays down, wincing a bit from the pain. A trainer begins to massage him. \nDavid just stares at the battered athlete. His gaze moves across the room. Beat. \nDavid stares at something in the crowded room then he starts towards it. \nHe moves through the room of players and trainers. He moves to the one area of the large room not occupied by anyone. \nDavid comes to a step at the foot of an Olympic bench press. Racks and racks of free weights sit behind the press. \nDavid looks down at the thick silver bar. Three large black plates are on either side. Six in all. \nDavid looks back and glances at the double doors where he should be standing. Beat. He looks to the twenty or so players and trainers in the room. Some of the players have headphones on. Some are staring into space. A couple are on cell phones... \nNo one notices David Dunne as he reaches for a forty-five pound black plate off the weight rack. \nThe huge disc slides onto the bar with almost NO SOUND... \nA matching forty-five pound disc goes on the other side... \nAnd then David adds another. He matches it on the other side... \nTHE BENCH CREAKS just the slightest bit as David takes a seat. \nNo one notices the security guard lay back on the bench. \nDavid's hands take hold of the shiny bar. \nHe closes his eyes... \nDavid's arms become tense. He pushes against the weight. It doesn't move. \nHis face turns deep red. He opens his eyes and stares at the bar as he keeps training. His face and arms are shaking... He keeps staring... focusing. \n", "test2_id": 1594, "test3_input": "Jeremy stops moving. \nDAVID -That was me they were talking about. I almost died. That was me. \nJEREMY(crying) -You're lying. \nDAVID -I'm not. I just didn't connect it. \nMEGAN -Jeremy, your father was injured in college - you know that. You know all about that. \nJeremy's small face tenses. Confusion mixes with the desperation on his face. \nMEGAN -Don't do it. He'll die Jeremy. \nBeat. Jeremy looks up, tears streaming down his cheeks. \nJEREMY(crying) -I'll just shoot him once. \nDAVID -Jeremy listen to what- \nJeremy starts pressing the trigger. The hammer clicks back. \nJEREMY -Don't be scared. \nDAVID -Jeremy if you pull that trigger I'm going to leave! I'm going to go to New York. \nJeremy freezes. David flashes a desperate glance at Megan then back to Jeremy. \nDAVID You're right... If you shoot me, that bullet is going to bounce off me and I won't get hurt... but then I'm going to go upstairs and pack. And then leave to New York. \nBeat. \nJEREMY(crying) -Why? \nJeremy's hands are trembling. He starts to close his eyes as he raises the gun level with David's chest. \nDAVID(loud) Jeremy! \nJeremy's eyes open. \nDAVID(loud) You're about to get into big trouble! I'm your father and I'm telling you to put that gun down right now God damn it! (beat) One!... (beat) Two!... \nJeremy puts the gun down on the floor in front of him and stands up. \nMegan leans against the refrigerator and slides down to a sitting position on the tiled floor. \nDavid walks over and picks up the gun. He unloads the bullets in his hand. David bends down very slowly and takes a seat on the kitchen floor. \nJeremy is the last to sit down. He takes a seat in the doorway of the kitchen. Beat. He wipes his eyes with the back of his hand. Beat. \nJEREMY(soft) ...You didn't have to yell. \nThe Dunne family sits in silence on the floor of their kitchen. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON \nPeople move up and down the streets outside the storefronts. David is one of them. He waits to cross the street. He sees movement inside the Limited Edition window. \nCUT TO: \nINT. LIMITED EDITION - AFTERNOON \nElijah opens the door. It takes him a bit, because of the wheelchair. \nDavid stares at Elijah's damaged condition. Beat. \nELIJAH Joined a rugby league. Turned out to be a bad idea. (beat) Come here I want to show you something. \nElijah wheels over to one of the framed sketches on the wall. It's a charcoal drawing of a muscular figure shielding himself from a blow about to be delivered. A huge ominous shadow is covering him, as if something unspeakable and evil is just out of frame. \nELIJAH Look at this. I just noticed this today. \nDavid steps in close and studies the drawing. \nELIJAH This is from the Sentryman series. A color version of this was actually used in the second issue. \nElijah points up to the drawing's face. \nELIJAH Look at this eyes. What do you see? \nDavid looks right at the intense eyes of the drawing. \nELIJAH It's fear. (beat) He was scared. They were being honest in the beginning you see. They let him be human. (beat) They turned him into a garden variety hero later... Then he was brave all the time. \n", "test3_true": "ELIJAH I followed the guy in the army jacket. \nDavid becomes still as his words register. \nELIJAH He had a silver handled gun tucked in the back of his pants. (beat) Were you really injured in that car accident in college? \nDavid looks unsteady all of the sudden. \nELIJAH Because I think you faked it. I think you took the opportunity to end your career - no questions asked. (beat) And I think you did it, of all things, for a women... (beat) Not only do you have the physical traits of a hero, down somewhere in there, you have the moral code of one too. You were ready to sacrifice everything for what's right. Where can you find that these days? (beat) Only thing you didn't realize is that you were giving up a part of yourself when you gave up football. The physical part. And you need that part desperately to feel balance again... (beat) You can have it back now. (beat) This was all just make believe before. What if there was someone the opposite of me? What if?... (beat) I now believe you are the genuine article Mr. David Dunne. The kind of person we knew existed, from our history. \nElijah points to the room full of pictures. \nELIJAH It's time for someone like you. (beat) Bad is winning. I can feel it. \nElijah looks at David with deep admiration. His voice cracked a little at the end of his words. Beat. \nDavid doesn't take his hands out of his pockets. \nDAVID(rattled) I must have felt some lump in his back when I bumped him. Most guns have a black or silver handle. I had a fifty-fifty shot at the color. \nELIJAH That's not what I witnessed David. \nDAVID Stop messing with my life Elijah. My son almost shot me last night. He wanted to prove you were right. \nELIJAH I never said you couldn't be killed. I never said that. \nDAVID You have a problem, Elijah. My wife is right. Somewhere along the line one of your bones broke and your mind just broke with it. \nBeat. \nELIJAH Are you finished? \nDAVID No. And I have been sick. I spent a week in a hospital when I was a boy recovering from pneumonia and almost drowning. \nDAVID Two skinny eight year old kids were playing around the pool. They were dunking me. I swallowed water. They didn't know it and they almost killed me. (beat) Heroes don't get killed like that. Normal people do. \nBeat. Elijah seems shaken for the first time. David stares at him coldly. \nDAVID I don't want to see you again okay. (soft) Now I'm finished. \nDavid turns and starts for the entrance. The BELL OF THE DOOR CLANGS as David Dunne leaves the store. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. STREET - AFTERNOON \nDavid exits the Limited Edition and moves down the street lost in this thoughts. He bumps a man in a jacket and tie walking in the opposite direction. \nFLASH CUT: THE SAME MAN STANDS IN A BAGGY SWEATER. AGAINST A PARKED CAR HE'S HOLDING SOMETHING SHINY AND METALLIC IN HIS HANDS. HE INSERTS IT IN THE HALF INCH GAP BETWEEN THE GLASS OF THE DRIVER'S WINDOW AND THE DOOR. THE DOOR UNLOCKS. \nTHE MAN LOOKS AROUND QUIETLY BEFORE ENTERING THE CAR. \nSLAM CUT BACK TO THE PRESENT: \nDavid looks over his shoulder at the conservative looking man in a shirt and tie walking down the street. \nDavid Dunne is shaken.

I'm fine with anything. \nDavid looks from the action figures, to his son's face to the face of his wife. They both have the same quiet anxious expression.

{"train": "ALI \nWritten by \nStephen J Rivele, Christopher Wilkinson, \nEric Roth & Michael Mann \nStory by \nGregory Allen Howard \nFADE IN: \nEXT. MIAMI STREET - MOVEMENT - NIGHT (1964) \nin the dark. Coming toward us. Up and down in sync to an INSTRUMENTAL LEAD-IN from somewhere. A slip of light. A glimpse of somebody in shadow under a sweatshirt hood, staring at us, in and out of the dark as... \nINT. THE STAGE, HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB - EMPTY FRAME - NIGHT \nA man walks into the shot, grabs a microphone, slips out of his jacket and looks at us. He wants to tell us something. He's in a lavender light. This is SAM COOKE. What he calls out...a throaty mixture of gospel, soul and sex...is \"Let me hear it!\" And WOMEN SHRIEK. He says, \"Yeah!\" They answer, shrieking, \"Oh, yeah!\"... \nEXT. MIAMI STREET - HOODED MAN'S FACE - NIGHT \nup and down, running along a dark road in the dead of night, passing vacant lots with debris amid trees and faded buildings. He is CASSIUS CLAY. He runs in construction boots. His eyes stare from under the hood. He passes the husk of an abandoned car, a pastel storefront. We're in Overtown, Miami's inner-city black neighborhood. \nINT. THE STAGE, HAMPTON HOUSE CLUB (MIAMI) - SAM COOKE \nshouts, \"Don't fight it! We gonna feel it!\"     The women in the audience answer: \"Gotta feel it!\" \nEXT. MIAMI STREET - CASSIUS - NIGHT \nnow runs diagonally across NW 7th INTERCUT with Cooke shouting, \"Yeah!\" EXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - CASSIUS - NIGHT \nSAM COOKE'S AUDIENCE (O.S.) Oh, yeah! \nCassius runs toward us. Off to the side in the black- mirrored water of Biscayne Bay, leaden clouds in a black sky. And now Sam Cooke SINGS \"...because you make me wanna mooove...!\" and breaks into the first verse of \"Feel It.\" But we see Cassius' eyes are FOCUSED, CONCENTRATED, ELSEWHERE. To where is this man running? Why is his expression so distant? A WHITE LIGHT suddenly hits him from behind. He looks over at... \nWIDE FROM THE FRONT:      CASSIUS + A METRO-DADE POLICE CAR \nthat's slowed, clocking the suspicious, running black man. The driver starts to pull over, to hassle Cassius. Then, the cop riding shotgun gets a radio call. He taps the driver's shoulder. They take off, the driver laughing. Cassius looks after the white cops. He is neither relieved nor angry. He's dismissive. And, instead, he sees something else... \nINT. A BOARD ROOM - GORDON DAVIDSON - DAY \nand six other patrician, white business-people of Louisville in their green baize and wood-paneled Luxo boardroom. They speak soundlessly and patronizingly to Cassius Clay, Sr., seated at the foot of the table. It relates to the stack of contracts in front of him. He is in a suit and tie, his hair and moustache are dapper. His tie's a little loud. He has his hands folded deferentially in front of him. \nLSG BOARD MEMBER (reading) \"...the successor trustee shall be fully authorized to pay or disperse such sums from the income or principal as may be required.\" (beat) Do you understand so far, Mr. Clay? \nCASSIUS CLAY, SR. Uh, yes, I do. \nWe get the impression that, if he doesn't understand what he's being told, he's faking it. He is conforming, delivering socially mandated deference... \nFRONTAL:   CASSIUS, SR. \nand BEYOND HIM, seated against the wall, is Cassius, Jr. in sport jacket and tie. Right now he looks to his left and to the right, and only then do we notice the entire wall he's against is covered with pictures of thoroughbreds and studs this Louisville Sponsoring Group owns as well. He is one among their sporting possessions. He doesn't like it. He looks at the back of his father listening. \nLSG BOARD MEMBER Are you sure, sir? \nCASSIUS CLAY, SR. Yeah.   I follow you. \nLSG BOARD MEMBER Okay. 'Cause I'd be happy to explain any of these terms. \nCASSIUS CLAY, SR. No, thank you. \nLSG BOARD MEMBER Thank you, sir. \nEXT. MACARTHUR CAUSEWAY - CLOSER:   CASSIUS' EYES - NIGHT \nback here, now, crossing through black night and over black water of the MacArthur Causeway. We start to HEAR pop pop pop pop pop pop POP over Sam Cooke's music, and Sam Cooke's image SUPERIMPOSES as he segues from \"Feelin'\" to \"Bring It On Home.\" And the pop pop pop pop pop carries us into... \nINT. THE FIFTH STREET GYM, (MIAMI) - SPEED BAG - DAWN \nCassius' fists fly in a reeling motion, hitting the speed bag. But it's his eyes that arrest us...focused, concentrated. \nOVER CASSIUS' SHOULDER:   BROWN SPEED BAG \nis a blur. And it SLOWS and becomes a brown boxing glove driving in a SLOWED straight line right at us like a piston. OVER the glove, pushing the fist at us is SONNY LISTON. The brown glove hits... \nINT. RING - A BOXER (N.D. BOXER) \nin a linear left jab. These punches are watched by Cassius' eyes in the Fifth Street Gym...studiously studying Liston's feet...straight-line movement...the jab, linear and straight at us. But it SLAMS into the Boxer, not Cassius. Down he goes. He's out. The referee pulls out his mouthpiece. It's a bloody mess. Teeth have been knocked out with it, so devastating is Sonny Liston... A distant crowd ROARS. \nINT. RING - CASSIUS - NIGHT \nVERY CLOSE, climbs into the crush with other contenders. Victorious, Liston, being escorted out, passes very close to him on purpose to say... \nSONNY LISTON (whispers; low) Gonna fuck you up. Gonna beat you like I's your daddy... \nTo Cassius, boxing is dangerous athletics, but Liston's malevolence is straight from the street. \nINT. FIFTH STREET GYM - CASSIUS' EYES \nSEE... \nA MAN (reading) ...210... Cassius Clay weighs 210 pounds. \nCASSIUS (changes down) You sure you got that right...? \nThe man nods. Cassius gets off, is pulled aside. And Liston gets on: unremitting stare of death at Cassius... \nTHE MAN 218. Sonny Liston...the heavyweight champion of the world weighs 218 pounds... \nBUNDINI Pounds of what?! \nAnd Cassius goes off again... \nCASSIUS Pounds of ugly! He so ugly, sweat run backwards off his forehead to get away from his face! C'mon, bear! I turn you into a rug!! Rumble right now, man! \nHe's restrained by Angelo and Bundini. \nSONNY LISTON (low) Keep talkin', punk-ass faggot! I'll fuck you up like I's your daddy... \nHandlers break it up and hustle Liston out of there. \nCASSIUS You whup me, I'll crawl out of the ring on my knees and catch the next jet plane out of the country. \nJIMMY CANNON (older reporter) That a promise? \nLaughter. \nCASSIUS (to Jimmy Cannon) ...you be the first eatin' his words! \nA Doctor claps a cuff around Cassius' arm, taking blood pressure. \nTHE DOCTOR (alarmed, to Pacheco) 210 over 110?! I can't let him in the ring in this condition! \nREPORTERS (shout) Liston says he'll talk with his fists. \"Lip from Louisville.\" (laughter) ...odds 7:1 against you. Big bet's whether he'll knock you out in the first round or third round or kill you altogether. You scared of him? \nCASSIUS I'm scared of no man. I give Sonny Liston talking lessons, boxing lessons and falling down lessons. \nCANNON/OTHERS Yeah, sure. Are you a Black Muslim? Pat Putnam in the Miami Herald said... \nCASSIUS \"Black Muslim\"'s a press word... \nDundee's defensive, fast... \nANGELO DUNDEE Man's religion's his own business. What kinda question's that? \nREPORTERS/HOWARD COSELL Does he hate white people? Malcolm X was in town. Then he left. Was that so he wouldn't embarrass you? Liston cannot stand you... \nANGELO DUNDEE (sees) Howard! \nHOWARD COSELL ...cannot stand you, Cassius.   He really wants to kill you... \nHOWARD COSELL is balding, tall, forties, lugging a tape recorder. \nCASSIUS Howard Cosell, you are an instigator! (Cosell smiles) How you get that way? When I'm done with Liston, I'm comin' for you! \nDundee uses that to end the conference before it strays into \"Black Muslim\" territory. Meanwhile on the way out... \nDOCTOR (to Pacheco) It doesn't come down, I cancel this fight. You call me in an hour with his blood pressure. \nEXT./INT. MIAMI RENTAL HOUSE - DR. PACHECO - DAY \npast guards, Bundini, press, starts to enter. Inside, Clay's on the sofa, in his underwear, watching \"The Man With the X-Ray Eyes,\" who has the power to imbue and control from beams emitted from his eyes. Dundee and Bingham hang out. \nCassius' mind is elsewhere. His eyes float to the corner of the doorway before we see Pacheco, even though from the outside, has started to enter... \nEXT. CASSIUS' RENTAL HOUSE, BACKYARD - CORNER OF HOUSE - DAY (MIAMI) \nNothing. Cassius is asleep in a lounge chair...incongruously a TV is run from the house by an extension cord. Cassius wakes. His eyes say, \"Who are you?\" \nBUNDINI (entering) I'm called Bundini, rhymes with Houdini. He was a Jew, too...some other people call me Fastblack...or Daddy Mac... \nDrew \"Bundini\" Brown, early forties, holds a hat in his hand, his eyes always seem to be glistening, ready to rage, laugh or cry, tentatively approaches. Cassius' flat eyes return to the television. \nBUNDINI (CONT'D) (motions at lounge chair) Shorty sent me to Sugar Ray Robinson. I gave my power to Sugar Ray for seven years, gave him my voodoo, my magic. Now Shorty sent me to you. \nCASSIUS Who Shorty? \nBUNDINI I call him Shorty 'cause he like 'em circumcised. Original people. Like Moses. And I was a babe in a basket, too. I was born on a doorstep with a note 'cross my chest that read, \"Do the best you can for him, world.\" I had to suck the first nipple come along. I didn't run away from home...I been runnin' to home. \nCassius should kick him out, but Bundini's got his foot in the door of Cassius' attention. \nBUNDINI (CONT'D) (beat, and his raison d'\u00eatre) Now, I gotta ask you. You fixin' them fights? Else no way you could tell great Archie Moore what round you droppin' him in...all of them predictions you make, comin' true. Never heard of nobody predictin' the round like you. You either a phony or Shorty's in your corner. Tell me the truth, young man... \nCassius, stretched out, mumbles without looking at him... \nCASSIUS ...I study every fight. 'Til I got a plan. Wear him down two through four. Drop him in the fifth round. So the p'diction ain't a p'diction. It's a plan. And 'cause of all the poppin' off I do, I know I gotta win! That's the truth. And why I'm tellin' you? \nBUNDINI 'Cause I'm gonna be your Inspiration. Your motivator. In your corner. Can I be in your corner, young man? \nCASSIUS (thinks, then) Yeah... \nBUNDINI (inexplicably moved, covers) Ain't spent much time in Miami. Where the water? \nCassius has drifted off, back to watching TV.    What he sees as his eyes close is: \nListon's getting a lot of strident advice.        THE BELL. \nINT. RING, ROUND THREE \nLISTON'S LEFT \ncomes in like a freight train. Cassius merely leans away to avoid Liston, circles and now snaps off a flurry and OPENS A CUT UNDER SONNY'S LEFT EYE. Then, he splits out of there. \nANNOUNCER (at ringside, on radio) He's opened a cut on Liston. Liston's never been cut! \nAnd Cassius, seizing opportunity, hits Liston with more combinations. If Cassius won Round One, probably but not certainly won Round Two, he now demonstrates he OWNS Round Three. It's a symphony of classical Cassius Clay footwork, flicked jabs that confuse, and, then, hard-hitting combinations that rock the presumably immovable Liston. No one told Sonny that Cassius could hit. And, at 210 pounds, he hits HARD. Liston, angered, panicked, knows he's losing and goes after Cassius and misses wildly as the BELL ends Round Three... \nINT. CLAY'S CORNER - CLAY \nstands a moment before he sits. \nEXTREMELY CLOSE:   CASSIUS CLAY \nbreathing heavily, ignoring the stool and Dundee and Bundini, looks around. THIS IS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE 22, TO BE CASSIUS CLAY, TO BE ON TOP OF YOUR GAME AND TO BE ABOUT TO OWN THE WORLD. He looks over the crowd. Only then, turns and sits... \nCASSIUS (to Dundee) He's nothin' to me... \nThe genius of Cassius... \nCASSIUS (CONT'D) And he knows it... \nINT. LISTON'S CORNER - CORNERMAN \nslips a vial of some medicant from his pocket and rubs it into Liston's shoulder. \nINT. RING - ROUND FOUR \nThe BELL RINGS. Clay peppers Liston with jabs.    Liston pokes his left at Cassius, trying to reach him.   They feint, \ncircle. Liston gets his left into Cassius' face.    It's more a poke than a shot. \nCLOSE:   CASSIUS \nblinks back something...we're not sure what. It seems to go away. Then it's back. The fight continues... \nWIDER:   CASSIUS \ndominating. They clinch. They break. This time Cassius violently blinks his eyes! Something's wrong! \nCASSIUS ...my eyes! \nA knife-like pain. He can't see.     He's getting beaten up. He's in trouble. The BELL. \nINT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS \nsits. \nCASSIUS (shouting) My eyes! I can't see...somethin' in my eyes! \nDundee feverishly washes water to get the irritant out of Cassius' eyes. \nINT. ARENA \nA buzzer sounds, warning the bell's coming for Round Five. Now Cassius stands, saying... \nCASSIUS (his gloves) Cut 'em off! Cut 'em!   I'm blind. \nThe BELL.    Dundee's still in the ring. \nANGELO DUNDEE No. You quit, it's over! Get out there. Be a yardstick. This is the big one, daddy. Get out there and run! \nHe literally pushes Cassius into the ring. \nINT. RING - ROUND FIVE - LISTON \nrushes Clay. He knows this is his chance. Cassius tries to tie Liston up by holding onto the back of his neck, but \nListon pounds left and right hooks. If anybody wondered if Clay could take punishment, this answers that. WHAM-WHAM- WHAM-WHAM-WHAM...five huge hooks. \nListon is desperate to end it while Cassius is in trouble. Haymaker after haymaker; some connect, others are blocked but knock Clay sideways. Clay, still blind, keeps backing and dancing. \nCLOSER:   CASSIUS' EYES \nWith a minute left, now, he sees better. Liston throws him into a corner, still trying to put him away. But, he can't, and Liston's energy seems to deflate once he knows that. The BELL. \nINT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - CASSIUS' \neyes are clear.   In 60 seconds he recovers his energy.    He's ready. BELL. \nINT. RING - ROUND SIX - CASSIUS \ncan't wait to get out. He shuffles. He circles. He fires combinations. In the early rounds, provoked by Cassius, Liston's anger caused him to abandon his fight plan. Now, having been proven futile, Liston's confidence is gone. He's left with nothing. Psychologically and athletically, Liston is defeated. The BELL. Liston's eyes contemplate the inevitable: face nine more rounds of this. \nINT. RING, CASSIUS' CORNER - BETWEEN ROUNDS - AS CASSIUS \nwaits for the seventh-round bell. \nHOWARD COSELL (doing color radio commentary with Les Kelter's blow-by-blow) ...Clay, a round ago, looked like he'd about had it, but in round six... \nAnd Cassius drops it on them... CASSIUS And I'm not Clay. Clay's the name of the people who owned by ancestors. I don't want to be called after that slave name no more. So I'm \"X.\" Cassius X. And I'm a member of the Nation of Islam. The Honorable Elijah Muhammad is my spiritual guide. Malcolm X is my mentor. \nThis is hard news! \nREPORTERS (all at once) You a card-carrying member?    Aren't Black Muslims a hate group? \nCASSIUS (droll) \"Card-carrying\"...? Don't need no \"card.\" You got a Christian card? 750 million people believe in Islam. I'm one of them. \nANOTHER REPORTER (O.S.) Minister Malcolm...what about the reports of a split between you and Elijah Muhammad? \nJOSEPH 13X:   we read his face listening to Malcolm. \nMALCOLM X This is the champ's time. And I'm here as a friend to celebrate his victory. So I got nothing you want... \nCASSIUS I'm going to be a people's champion. But I don't have to be the way you want me to be. I'm gonna be what I want. And I'm free to think any way I want... \nAnd, as he goes on, the crowd knows neither Cassius nor Malcolm will ever turn their backs on them. \nEXT. THE HOTEL THERESA - MALCOLM - NIGHT \nenters into the street with his Bodyguard and looks up to a top-floor window in which he sees a light is still on at 4 a.m. \nINT. THE HOTEL THERESA, CASSIUS' ROOM - CASSIUS - BEFORE DAWN \nasleep with the television on. There's a knock on the door. Barely awake, he gets up to answer it. It's Malcolm. Still in his familiar hat and overcoat. He hasn't slept... \nMALCOLM X I was leaving, saw the light on...how come you're up? \nCASSIUS (mumbles, half-asleep) ...watchin' a show on termites...they knockin' down this house, here. \nHe goes back to lay on the bed. Malcolm looks out the window...the wet streets at night. \nMALCOLM X I been invited to speak at Ibadan University in Nigeria. C'mon with me? \nCASSIUS Six million in your house and you don't know it. Where? \nMALCOLM X Africa.   You been there? \nCASSIUS Africa? No. Only Rome.      Yeah, man, let's go! \nMALCOLM X Nkrumah stayed with me when he was a student in New York, so we'll stop in Ghana... \nCASSIUS When we leaving? \nMALCOLM X Next Thursday. \nMalcolm's distracted.   He fingers his glasses. \nCASSIUS (sees) What is it? \nMALCOLM X You ever been so angry...have you ever been so angry that you'd explode? \nCASSIUS (after a beat) Tore out a picture of Emmett Till when I was little. Couldn't take my eyes to it...couldn't look at it. Barb-wire around his neck to a 75- pound cotton-gin fan. Took out his eye. The cruelty to it...I couldn't look at it...couldn't throw it away. \nMALCOLM X What else? \nCASSIUS I thought, \"What I do wrong to be so low that people could do that to people like me?\" It made me feel ashamed. And that makes no sense. But that's what it was. \nMALCOLM X ...when I heard about the four girls bombed in the 16th Street Church in Birmingham? (beat) The prohibitions of the Honorable Elijah Muhammad prevented me from speaking my voice in action. Because Birmingham was part of the civil rights movement, begging for a place at the white man's table... But dead children...are dead children. So the anger I felt, I had to contain. I locked that down! So tight my muscles seized. I lost control over the right side of my body. Leg didn't work...right arm didn't work. \"I'm having a stroke,\" I thought. I had to hold it in 'cause I wanted, all I wanted was to BREAK SOMETHING! Break a part...any part of this system. Because you are so provoked as a human being. In your spirit. In your heart... At the death of children. But I COULD DO...nothing. \nCassius is quiet. \nMALCOLM X (CONT'D) (putting his glasses back on) Everyone knows... Now I'm advocating more direct political action involvement with the international struggle... So Elijah Muhammad has suspended me as a Minister in the Nation of Islam for 90 days. \nCASSIUS You can fix that... \nMALCOLM X I don't know. I will try when we get back. Until then I will live each day as if I am already dead. \nThat statement surprises Cassius, but he says nothing. Malcolm X stands by the window and watches the day begin in Harlem. \nINT. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S HOUSE, CHICAGO, 1964 - JOSEPH 13X - DAY \napproaches Cassius in a suit and tie and beckons him into a living room in which sits Elijah Muhammad on a plastic- covered white sofa. Cassius is at his most deferential, awed at being in this man's presence. Elijah's power is the inverse of his size. He's short and delicate-featured. He motions for Cassius to sit beside him. Joseph 13X sits across the room with two men. \nELIJAH MUHAMMAD Only after long service and high merit in the spiritual and physical rebirth of Afro-American people...is one granted an original name. But you are special. A world champion. So there is a gift I wish to give you. From this day forward you will be known as Muhammad Ali...which means \"one worthy of praise,\" and Ali means \"most high.\" \nCASSIUS (a beat, sounding it) Muhammad Ali. (humble) \"Worthy of praise...\" Thank you! \nAnd he's genuinely moved. As Elijah Muhammad puts his small hands in Muhammad Ali's hands...giving him his blessings... \nELIJAH MUHAMMAD (cautioning) Be very careful what you say...your words reflect on the nation of Islam, now. \nCASSIUS Yes, sir. \nELIJAH MUHAMMAD (after a beat) Up until now, I have entrusted your spiritual development to Brother Malcolm. (beat) I do not feel this is a wise course anymore. \nExtremely emotional about Malcolm, tears come to Elijah Muhammad's eyes. Joseph 13X observes in the background. Cassius is taken by surprise at \"The Messenger\"'s display... \nELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONT'D) Malcolm has gone off into the secular world and does not measure his words. I have decided to give you, as your guide, my very own son, Herbert Muhammad. \nAnd he looks across the room...a roly-poly man wearing a bow tie...HERBERT MUHAMMAD. He has a habit of nervously straightening his shirt. A seemingly mild, pleasant man, he is without self-definition. Below this avuncular surface, he defines himself by quietly desiring and acquiring what is others'. \nELIJAH MUHAMMAD (CONT'D) Herbert will supervise all of your spiritual and material needs. \nBetty has come in.   They exchange a look. \nBETTY SHABAZZ (concerned for her husband) Malcolm? \nMALCOLM X (after a beat, disconsolate) Cassius won't be coming to Africa...not with me. \nShe puts her hand on Malcolm's shoulder. \nBETTY SHABAZZ Go anyway. Don't put it off.      It's not safe here. ONE OF HIS CHILDREN (OVER) (calling) Mommy...the bath's ready... \nCUT TO: \nINT. GHANA AIR DC-8 COCKPIT - ALI - NIGHT \nin first class on a \"Ghana Airlines\" flight to Africa. Close by is Herbert Muhammad. Howard Bingham and Ali's brother, Rudy, are across the aisle from him, asleep...   The plane bumps in choppy air. \nMuhammad, unable to sleep, a nervous flyer, gets up. He wanders up the aisle to the front of the plane. A Stewardess comes out of the cockpit. Muhammad slows, startled by the pilots. Both pilot and copilot are black. \nALI (joking) Hey, man, where they put the real pilot? What you doin' up here? \nPILOT (not understanding; British accent) I am...the pilot. He's the copilot... (moves map case) Here, Mr. Clay, sit down... \nALI No, man, I meant...in L'ville, when I growed up, they barely let black folks drive buses. \nAli looks out the window...a new day downs over the land. Then Bingham shows up over Ali's shoulder. They all pose, facing the rear of the cockpit. Then, the Pilot points to the coast below them and the sunrise... \nTHE PILOT Here we are. Cote d'Ivoire...Africa. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. BUILDING IN CAIRO - CABLE - DAY (EGYPT) \nsnakes out a building.   CAM FOLLOWS IT and we HEAR... \nBETTY SHABAZZ (V.O.) We should think of a name, Malcolm... INT. CAIRO BUILDING - WIDE:   HALLWAY - DAY \nMARLIN THOMAS -- paunchy, grey, late 40's -- walks up the stairs carrying take-out food. \nMALCOLM X (V.O.) How about Gamilah or Khalilah? \nINT. CAIRO EMPTY APARTMENT - MARLIN THOMAS - DAY \ncrosses to ANOTHER AMERICAN wearing headphones in the glassed-in balcony where the CABLE connects to a portable tape-recorder. \nMARLIN THOMAS (eating) Anything? \nTHE MAN ...on the phone with his wife. She's having a hard time sleeping...baby's kicking a lot... \nMARLIN THOMAS Motor Pool, here, have a Chevy parts catalogue...? \nAs the CIA monitors Malcolm X... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. INDEPENDENCE SQUARE, ACCRA - ALI - DAY (GHANA) \nin a Mercedes convertible. It's a monumental expression of the force for the independence of black Africa. Accra is a wonder to Ali. A Third World showplace, in 1964 Ghana is alive with the optimism of emerging Africa. Infrastructure \nand real estate are well-managed. Under Nkrumah, the city is in a frenzy of building public housing... \nALI \nin the three-car caravan, passes the huge triumphal arch with its giant black star on the top. Thousands line the route to see the heavyweight champion and cheer him. For Ali it's another kind of parade... \nALI'S POV:   GHANAIANS \nThey're stockbrokers and street cleaners, salesmen and secretaries, hotel managers and military officers... All is a contrast to the de facto apartheid of the middle America of Ali's experience. They all cheer his caravan as it passes. CUT TO: \nEXT. THE AMBASSADOR HOTEL, ACCRA - MERCEDES - LATE AFTERNOON (GHANA) \narrives with Ali and entourage. It's a modern hotel. Meanwhile, a different group are about to depart in limos. One among them, a tall Man in a dashiki and sunglasses and carrying a walking stick, separates. He sees Ali. So does the woman next to him. She is the poet Maya Angelou. \nMALCOLM X (shouts) Brother Muhammad... \nTaking off his shades, we realize it's Malcolm X. He wears a goatee, now. Ali turns, sees him. Total surprise. \nALI Hey, man!!! \nThey embrace. Ali greets him like the old friend he is. Maya and the Chinese diplomat wait a few steps removed. \nALI (CONT'D) How you doin'? What's up, brother? I knew you were here...didn't think you were still here... \nMALCOLM X And I heard you were coming. \nALI We just got here now... (words rush out) And, maaan, the brothers were flyin' a DC 8. Flippin' switches, navigatin', filing flight plans, talkin' French... \nAnd they remember how much they like each other. \nALI (CONT'D) Where you goin'? \nMALCOLM X When...uh, Liberia.   When you fighting Liston? ALI November. \nMALCOLM X This is Maya Angelou and Ambassador Huang Ha. Amando Gonzalez is from Cuba. Taher Kaid is the Ambassador from Algeria. \nSONJI My father named me after Sonja Henie. \nALI What's your father do? \nSONJI He was shot in a poker game when I was two. He don't do nothin'. Sonja, on the other hand, was an ice skater, and my mother died when I was eleven. \nALI So who raised you? \nSONJI Godparents, but I been on my own, doing my own thing... \nALI Whatcha doin' tomorrow?       Go ridin' with me. \nSONJI No.   I gotta work, you know. \nALI I square it with Herbert.       I got a record player in my car. \nSONJI A record player?     C'mon.    How come it don't skip? \nALI Got springs and stuff. \nSONJI Herbert said you met The Beatles. \nALI Yeah. Only one of 'em's smart...the one with the glasses. \nSONJI ...he's my favorite. \nALI People all screaming and fainting. I asked him, \"This the way they act when you get big?\" \nSONJI What he say? \nALI He said, \"Champ. The more real you get, the more unreal it gonna get.\" \nSONJI Wow... \nAfter Sheri sings the first chorus... \nALI Let's go... \nSONJI Yeah... \nALI (crossing out) Where you live? \nSONJI I'm takin' you there... \nHerbert looks up from his booth, starts to ask where they're going...but they're gone. He turns back to the man he's talking to... \nINT. SONJI'S APARTMENT - WINDOW - NIGHT (1964) \nPULL BACK from being above Chicago in the winter at night to Ali and Sonji making love where Sheri's voice sings the second verse. To Ali's reactions... \nALI I think I gonna keep you around forever, girl. \nSONJI (laughs) Well, I'm not too busy right now, so...I'll think on it. \nALI Herbert said you weren't a Muslim. \nSONJI Cover my hair? No make-up?     Long dresses? Honey, please. (beat) Were you a virgin? \nALI Why? \nSONJI (laughs) 'Cause you so \"gone\" off a little good time. \nALI I'm no virgin...but I may as well be. (beat) I ain't jokin'! I always know when I know. See this face? I mean, you got a pretty face for a girl's face, but you ever seen somethin' as pretty as me? Now, you about five-foot-three...that's too small. But I overlook that, too, 'cause... \nSONJI (sarcastic) Thank you so much. \nALI ...'cause of your spirit! \nSONJI My \"spirit\"...? \nALI Yeah.   'Cause you too much fun! \nSONJI You serious? \nShe raises his head next to hers, looks in his eyes. \nALI But you gotta be a Muslim. \nSONJI Huh? How you do that? Step over a broom...shazaam...you a Muslim? \nShe laughs. He rests his head on her stomach.   He likes her irreverence... \nALI Maaan, I ain't never been with a girl like you. \nSONJI Baby, maybe you ain't ever gonna be with any other. \nThey start making love again. \nEXT./INT. 50TH ON THE LAKE MOTEL, COFFEE SHOP - ALI, HERBERT, BUNDINI + BINGHAM - DAY \nHERBERT What? \nALI That's right.   I wanna marry her. \nHe's dressed for an occasion. \nSONJI (V.O.) I'm changing my damn clothes! You didn't like what I was wearin'! \nAs Ali re-enters the living room, there's a knock on the door...\"Room Service...\" \nBUNDINI Come on in...! (sees) What's that? \nROOM SERVICE (with large glass) What you wanted, isn't it...a water glass with vodka...? \nBUNDINI That was before... \nROOM SERVICE Before what? \nBUNDINI Before you showed up... \nAnd, now, Sonji comes out. This dress makes what she had been wearing look demure. Tight angora sweater and a miniskirt. She's Tina Turner 30 years ago. \nSONJI I fine runnin' around in all these cute short things for you. I submissive to you. But I ain't gonna be submissive to the Brother X's and what they think. They askin' me questions alla time anyway. \nALI What questions?! \nSONJI (V.O.) About you and us and I ain't tellin' 'em shit. \nCASSIUS CLAY, SR. (drunk) Tell it like it is, sugar! They took my boy's name...and what they give him back? Bad style. \nAli takes her back into the bedroom and closes the door. \nSONJI I don't drink. I don't smoke. I converted to Islam for you and... \nINT. BEDROOM - SONJI + ALI - NIGHT \nSONJI All except the dress! I ain't puttin' no bleached-out, double- ugly bedsheets on this body, honey! I'm normal! \nHe's furious. She smiles. He picks her up. She moans and her tongue darts in his ear and they're on the bed making out. And as CAMERA DRIFTS away we HEAR D.J. Daddio Daley's \"Jazz Patio\"... \nINT. A NEW CAR (CHICAGO) - ALI - DAY \nking of the city, cruising through the pristine winter air of Chicago... DADDIO (on radio) Hey there, old, aware ones. And you, too, my fair ones...This is \"Daddio's Jazz Patio.\" ON KBCA this fine day, which is A-okay... \nSegues to...Brubeck's \"Time Out,\" cruising... \nINT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM, HARLEM - REAR OF MALCOLM'S HEAD - DAY \ncenter-punches the   FRAME through the green-glazed terra- cotta hallway. He    and his Bodyguard (#1) come to a door. Shedding his coat,   he hesitates, and like a prizefighter gathering himself,   he goes inside. \nINT. ALI'S NEW CAR - ALI - DAY \nat a light, waves to a cluster of girls waiting for a bus who recognize him, go nuts...listening to Brubeck... \nINT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM - MALCOLM - DAY \nwalks across the stage, aware of every little sound, every motion. He makes his way to the podium...peering beyond his glasses at the gathered. Bodyguard #1 goes to the side door instead of standing next to him...and Malcolm notices that...as he... \nMALCOLM X As-Salaam Alaikum... \nTHE GATHERED Wa-Alaikum-Salaam... \nAnd two young Black men, TALMADGE HAYER and NORMAN BUTLER immediately stand up in the back, jostling each other... \nA YOUNG MAN (shouts) What you doin' in my pockets, man? Get your hand outta my pocket! \nMALCOLM X Hold it, hold it, brothers! (pleading) Let's be cool. \nAnd the commotion in the back diverts Bodyguards #1 and #2 towards the rear, away from the stage and Malcolm, as... \nTHOMAS JOHNSON comes forward from a front row, his coat flapping open, revealing the 12-gauge sawed-off double- barrel shotgun coming up. \nMALCOLM'S EYES \ngo to it.    Settle on it.   He new it was coming, as... \nJOHNSON, an indifferent expression on his face, FIRES one barrel at... \nMALCOLM \n...which rips through the lectern as if paper and SLAMS a dead-center into his chest a seven-ring. 12 pellets, each the size of .32 bullet. Seven destroy Malcolm's heart. Five shred his aorta and burrow into his spine. Malcolm's hands fly back, and he topples, crashing off empty chairs onto the floor. \nUPSIDEDOWN ECU:   MALCOLM'S FACE + PAST \n...as life exhales from his mouth and his eyes go grey, dying, indifferent to Johnson emptying a second blast into him and the meaningless indignities of Hayer and Butler firing a .45 and a 9mm Luger at him. \nINT. ALI'S CAR - RADIO - DAY \nDave Brubeck, loud... \nINT. THE AUDUBON BALLROOM - STAGE - DAY \nChaos. Malcolm on the floor. Betty kneels over his body, desperately trying to breathe life into it. An Asian woman, a disciple, holds up his head. Somebody shouts, \"Jesus, God!\" But there is no God today... \nINT. ALI'S CAR - ALI - DAY \nstops short at a light because a man runs across the street. \nBOB ARUM (to Ali + Eskridge) I got to get you some fights.    Fast. \nAli's quiet, not really listening anymore... \nINT. ILLINOIS BOXING COMMISSION - ALI - DAY \nwearing a suit and a narrow tie at a table in front of Daley machine apparatchiks. A bald man, angrily: \nCOMMISSIONER You understand we could take away your license to fight Terrell in Illinois? \nALI Yes. \nCOMMISSIONER Are you prepared to apologize? About your unpatriotic remarks that you made? \nALI Apologize? No. \nCOMMISSIONER You said that you were the people's champion. \nALI (angry) Yes, sir! \nCOMMISSIONER Do you think you're acting like the people's champion...?! \nALI Yes, sir. I am not going to apologize to you. This isn't a courtroom. And I don't have to sit here and answer your questions. \nAli gets up and walks out on them.   Eskridge and NOI men in black suits follow. \nINT. CHICAGO OFFICE BUILDING - ALI + ENTOURAGE - DAY \nmarch through the lobby. Ali gives a walking interview. He's angry. He won't slow down. \nALI I ain't draft dodgin'! I ain't goin' to Canada. I ain't burnin' my draft card. I ain't burnin' the flag. I'm stayin' right here. And you want to throw me in jail? Go ahead. I'll do my time. I been in jail four hundred years. I'll be in jail four, five more. But I ain't goin' ten thousand miles to help murder and kill poor people for you. 'Cause if I'm gonna die, I'll die now, right here, fighting you. If I wanna die. You my enemy, not Vietcong or Chinese or Japanese. You my opposer when I want freedom. You my opposer when I want justice. You my opposer when I want equality. You want me to go somewhere for you, but you won't even stand up for me in America, for my rights and beliefs, you won't even stand up for me here at home. \nINT. THE HOUSTON ASTRODOME - CLOSE:   TERRELL - DAY \nERNIE TERRELL is taller than Ali. The empty stadium has a scale and press at one end. Girls in cowboy hats and lone stars say we're in Texas. Ali is distracted. \nERNIE TERRELL (getting on scale) Tell Clay he can get on after me. \nALI What...? \nERNIE TERRELL Get on the scale after... \nALI (cuts in) What you call me...? \nTerrell wrongly thinks there's psychological value in provoking Ali. \nERNIE TERRELL Only thing I knows you as:   Cassius Clay! \nALI (infuriated) Announce it right here or from flat on your back! \nAli throws a punch that doesn't land because he's separated. \nALI (CONT'D) What's my name?!? \nCLOSE ON ALI \nsomething else in his eyes. \nINT. THE HOUSTON ASTRODOME - TERRELL - NIGHT \nhit FOUR TIMES by Ali:   WHAM, WHAM, WHAM, WHAM!   In the glaring lights... \nALI What's my name, motherfucker?! \nAnd Ali flicks out punches...disorienting Terrell.   The BELL. \nGIRL IN BANGLED MINISKIRT STARTS 15TH ROUND \nWHAM! WHAM! WHAM! Ali hits him five times...Terrell ties him up. Ali throws him off, slips two jabs and snaps his left into Terrell's face. \nALI (CONT'D) What's my name? Ali, at the apex of his athletic skills, fires six- or eight-punch combinations and then changes direction. Ali shoots jabs and hooks going backwards; every move and set of combinations is a dance. Ali's never been as light on his feet, as fast, as complex as in this fight. Like any moment of greatness, we want it to last forever... Then, Ali throws a 17-punch combination. \nALI (CONT'D) WHAT'S MY NAME?! \n...that burns down Terrell. Terrell starts to fall. Ali moves away. He doesn't want it to end. Sportswriters don't like it. Half the fans don't like it. Ali defies both their sensibilities and their politics. \nTERRELL'S \nface is battered.    Ali SLAMS in SHOTS. \nALI (CONT'D) (shouted) My name?! WHAT'S MY NAME?! \nThe BELL ends the savage pounding. Ali in the middle of the ring, glorying in opposition and triumph. \nINT. HOUSTON COURTROOM - ALI - DAY \nwith Eskridge and his other attorneys. The courtroom's packed. In the back we spot Joe Smiley, anonymous in the crowd. \nALI (to Judge) If the court would give me my sentence right now instead of waiting and stalling. \nJUDGE INGRAHAM (obliges) My pleasure. The jury has found you guilty of refusing induction into the United States armed forces. I sentence you to the maximum sentence allowable...five years' imprisonment and a fine of ten thousand dollars. (pause) Fast enough? Your attorney will lodge an appeal. While you're out on bond, I order your passport surrendered. I'll not have you benefitting yourself by fighting abroad... \nINT. HOUSTON COURT, FOYER - ALI - DAY \nALI Can't fight here. Can't fight outside the country... \nCHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE I know people in the restaurant business...want to start up a chain. Muhammad Ali's \"Champ Burger\"...\"Muhammad Malts,\" \"Fist Full of Fries\"...all of that. \nThey start out towards the gas pumps. \nALI Why I want to be in the restaurant business?! \nCHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE 'Cause you need the money. \nALI How much all this gonna cost? \nCHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE Too much.    They do that to you, too, you know. \nThey seek to destroy every facet of Ali's life. Ali knows that. As they pass the pumps. Some customers recognize him. \nCHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE (CONT'D) Where you goin'? \nALI (to customers) Look out! \nCUSTOMER Hey, champ! \nAnd Ali pretends to start sparring. The working men laugh. One is brave enough to raise his hands, too. Ali smiles and trades a couple of phantom slaps. It breaks off. He made their day. He shakes each of their hands. His spirit's raised, he walks off. Chauncey watches this ritual... \nINT. CHICAGO APARTMENT, ALI + BELINDA'S BEDROOM - NIGHT \nhands and skin and faces against white in bed.   So close we are intimately inside the moment... \nALI Not then... \nBELINDA First time? 1961...Sister Khalilah introduced you at assembly. You said you would be heavyweight champion of the world by the time you were twenty-one! \nALI I always tell the truth... \nBELINDA I was eleven. I interviewed you for the student paper. You called me \"little Indian girl,\" 'cause I wore my hair real long, in a braid...I told you...\"Man, you scribble! You can't even write! You ought to go back to school until you do it better...\" \nLaughing, he starts poking her in the ribs, and she turns onto him. She's six feet tall, he's six-three. He grabs her wrist. She wrestles him down on the large bed until there's a NOISE, and Belinda separates from Ali and approaches a smaller bedroom to replace the bottle their daughter, MARYUM, threw out of her crib. As she exits, MOVE IN on the crib in streetlight and we HEAR Jimi Hendrix's bottleneck instrumental part of \"All Along the Watchtower.\" It makes us feel the child in the crib is threatened, and that takes us INTO... \nINT. COLLEGE HALL - ALI \nin a black leather jacket with a white shirt and skinny tie, speaking to an audience of college students, white and black, some Asian and Latino. \nJIMI HENDRIX (from \"All Along the Watchtower\") \"There must be some kind of way outta here, said the joker to the thief...\" \nBingham waits in the wings. Applause. Ali joins Howard and a small group watching a portable TV... \nTV:   \"DAYS OF RAGE\" \noccurring on Chicago's North Clark Street. Off-screen we HEAR police sirens. On TV, Weathermen attack lines of Chicago police! The cops fall back. \nJIMI HENDRIX (CONT'D) \"There's too much confusion, I can't get no relief. Business men, they drink my wine, plowmen dig my earth, None of them along the line, know what any of it is worth.\" \nINT. CHICAGO GYM - ALI - NIGHT \ntrains in grey sweats to Hendrix. He flashes 60 sit-ups hanging off a table. He sweats profusely. He has no trainers. Bingham holds his legs. Ali seems heavier. \nThe gym is grimy, filled with other boxers, a forest of heavy bags. Ali's one among other guys working out. \nALI'S FACE \ngrimacing through another set, trying to stay in shape, trying to retain skills going dormant. \nJIMI HENDRIX \"No reason to get excited, the thief, he kindly spoke. There are many here among us, who feel that life is but a joke.\" \nThen, he's slow on the heavy bag.   Sparring alone in the ring... Everyone ignores him. \nINT. ALI'S GAS STATION - ALI'S TV:   NEWS - DAY \nREVEAL Ali + Bingham watching the 1968 Olympics. NOW, Tommy Smith and John Carlos bow their heads and raise fists in black power defiance, instead of acknowledging the national anthem. \nJIMI HENDRIX \"But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate. So let us not talk falsely now, the hour it's getting late...\" \nAnd the coverage cuts to George Foreman with a small American flag in his hand. Then, it flashes back to Ali in the ring with Sonny Liston at his feet. And Ali coming out of the Illinois Boxing Commission, angry. Dead Black Panthers, Fred Hampton and Matt Clark murdered by police in Chicago. And Malcolm X and Ali together. The meaning of it is clear: MUHAMMAD ALI IS THE WARRIOR SAINT IN THE REVOLT OF THE BLACK ATHLETE IN AMERICA. On Ali watching, as a phone rings... \nJIMI HENDRIX (CONT'D) \"All along the watchtower, princes kept the view, while all the women came and went, barefoot servants, too.\" \nEXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE - DAY \nspeaks to Ali on a pay phone on ground level. \nCHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE ...struck out at the appellate level in New Orleans. So we're heading back to the Supreme Court... \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. ALI'S GAS STATION - ALI - DAY \nALI Thought we already got turned down there. \nEXT. MEMPHIS MOTEL - CHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE \nCHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE I'm petitioning on a conscientious objection basis. Religious belief. We'll petition that your sincere religious belief prohibits you from shooting people. I believe they'll hear that... \nA fast car drives by, distracting Ali momentarily.   Then, Ali focuses 100% on... \nAli gets in, Frazier takes off. He sits sideways on the seat, steers with one finger, flicks on the radio: Isaac Hayes. FRAZIER (CONT'D) What the hell you in Philly for? Philly my town. \nALI To be closer to you, honey. \nFRAZIER Fuck you. \nALI There be two undefeated heavyweight champions! And they ain't fighting! \nFRAZIER I wanna fight you! Said it a hundred times. The Man won't let you fight no more. What you complainin' to me for? ALI 'Cause you gotta get behind this and we gotta do this. \nFrazier screeches to a stop in the middle of Columbia Avenue. \nFRAZIER We...\"gotta\" do nothin'!!! \nALI You wanna get this on, Joe?     You and me? Or not?! \nFRAZIER What about your license? \nALI I can fight in Atlanta. \nFRAZIER How's that? What about the Boxing Commission? \nALI Georgia ain't got no state boxing commission. And Atlanta got a black city council; a liberal Jewish mayor, Sam something. It all set. I do a prelim in Atlanta with Jerry Quarry. But we got to get the steamroller movin' now. \nFRAZIER What I got to do? \nALI You announce that if I beat Quarry you give me the title shot. (puts it to him) So what you say...maaan? \nFrazier stops in front of his renovated duplex in the North Philadelphia ghetto. \nFRAZIER My daddy was a sharecropper. I worked in a slaughterhouse...right on that corner. I came up from nothing. (raises fist) What I got, I got with this. And I already got the title. So I got nothing to win and everything to lose. \nALI But you know you ain't the champ yet. \nFRAZIER (looks at him) Yeah...\"yet.\" (beat) All right. You beat Quarry, I'll get inna ring and fuck you up... \nThey drive off.   After a moment, Frazier looks sideways at him. \nFRAZIER (CONT'D) (quieter) You need any money or anything to tide you by...? \nALI (turns away) I'm fine. Thanks. \nAnd Ali rests a hand on Frazier's shoulder, and they drive off like that. \nINT. FIFTH STREET GYM - ALI + LARRY HOLMES - DAY \nsparring. Ali's sweating more than we have seen him sweat before. It's pouring off him. It stains wet his grey sweatsuit. INTO HIS EYES, through the headgear... \nWIDER \nBingham takes pictures. Sarria, Rudy and the media in force are there for the start of Ali's comeback. \nFROM BEHIND ALI'S HEAD GEAR \nAli spots...a figure step through the door. It's Bundini. Ali, seeing everything all the time, reacts not at all, turns his back. Bundini is thin, drawn, stooped, but clear- eyed. Everyone turns. It takes tremendous courage for Bundini to walk to the ring, expecting another rejection. \nANGELO DUNDEE TIME!! \nAli goes to Angelo in his corner. \nANGELO DUNDEE (CONT'D) Weight's comin' down. 222. \nAli first acknowledges Bundini.     Ali moves down the rope, scowls down at him. ALI What you want? \nBUNDINI Take me back, boss. \nALI You want me to take you back? \nBUNDINI I'm clean. (beat) And you a resurrection. This is God's act. Anybody love poor people and little people and fucked-up people gotta be a prophet. (MORE) \nBUNDINI (CONT'D) And the prophet is going home. You the sun. Let me live in the light. (pause) Take me with, boss. (beat) ...I'll do anything. \nAli considers this man: all jive and bullshit and also his shaman and resident poet. \nALI (quietly) You can't hit what you can't see. \nBundini slowly comes alive, then: BUNDINI (quietly) Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee. \nThey look at each other. \nALI/BUNDINI (quietly) Rumble, young man, rumble! \nINT. CITY AUDITORIUM, ATLANTA - ALI + QUARRY - NIGHT \nWe've entered mid-fight in the second round. We're VERY CLOSE. Quarry has Ali against the ropes. Ali pushes him off. Quarry comes in again. Ali dances, feints and catches Quarry over his right eye with a jab thrown while going backwards! \nQUARRY \nshakes it off. Reorganizes. Throws two jabs, a right to the body and tries to follow it up with a left hook. Ali ties him up. The ref separates them. Quarry comes in again. Ali throws a left cross over Quarry's right, which Ali leaned away from, and adds two rapid, glancing jabs to the same spot. And Ali OPENS A CUT. The BELL sounds, ending Round Two. \nCROWD \ngoes nuts, that part that's pro-Ali: Atlanta's black elite and scattered whites. And the thunderous noise becomes one sound, one momentum, cheering their warrior saint, their defiant champion's return. And their ROAR becomes THUNDER...a momentum unto its own, driving... \n#7 \"Anyone bringing guestes in for dinner without prior notice will be awarded thwacks on skull with sharpe object.\" #8 \"Please waite, Rome wasn't burnt in a day; it takes a while to burne the roaste.\" Lana Shabazz answers a phone and brings it to Ali. Ali's got one of the twins, feeding her a bottle and drinking from it, too. \nINTERCUT WITH: \nINT. ABC WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS SET - COSELL - DAY \nHOWARD COSELL Muhammad, you T.K.O.'ed 'em... \nALI What are you talking about, Howard? Quarry? \nHOWARD COSELL (reads) No. \"The Supreme Court ruled today in the case of the United States vs. Cassius Clay, a.k.a. Muhammad Ali...\" (looks up) You won an 8-0 unanimous decision. You're free. \nINT. THE DINING HALL - ALI - LATE AFTERNOON \ntakes in the news, thanks Howard and hangs up. It is a shining moment after living under the threat of imprisonment for three-and-a-half years. \nALI I'm free. ANGELO DUNDEE What are you talking about? \nALI Supreme Court set me free. \nBUNDINI That's 'cause they know the king is gonna go home to his throne. And they know everybody's with you, now. And they wanna be on the RIGHT side! \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN - WIDE - NIGHT \nA sea of glitter: the Black royalty of America in their '70's robes. Movie stars 20 rows back. Burt Lancaster is Cosell's color man. Frank Sinatra is working as a still \nphotographer. In the press section are Plimpton types, Schulberg/Mailer types, Lipsyte, Cosell. \nMICROPHONE \ndescends from the overhead lighting grid.   The announcer's hand takes it... \nANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, fifteen rounds of boxing for the heavyweight championship of the world... \nALI looking out the hood of his robe, dancing, shaking it out, loosening up. \nANNOUNCER (CONT'D) ...the contender and former heavyweight champion of the world, seeking to regain his title, from Louisville, Kentucky, Muhammad Ali!!! \nCatcalls and boos. The other half is a comeback sound. It is a nation divided: pro-war right-wingers, Nixon supporters are for Frazier; the anti-war movement, celebrities, New York liberal establishment, blacks, Puerto Ricans and hippies are for Ali. \nANNOUNCER And in the opposite corner, the current heavyweight champion of the world, Smokin' Joe Frazier...! \nThe contentious roar diminishes only slightly for the announcer. \nALI'S EYES deep in his focused concentration. His attention so arrow like it reminds us of the younger man in the Liston fight...pure purpose. \nTHE RING \n...only SILENCE as the referee's instructions are given in SLO-MOTION. Ali bounces on the canvas. We HEAR his feet shift, turn, dance...and his breathing, expectant. Here comes the return of what was unfairly taken: his heavyweight championship. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMID-FIGHT - ALI \nlooks swollen,      out of breath. Something's wrong! Two solid Ali jabs and a      right hook connect. But they slow down Frazier not at      all. Joe Frazier, short and compact, like a pit bull, bobs      and weaves his way inside Ali's longer reach. \nALI'S CORNER - DUNDEE + BUNDINI \nshouting instructions.        None get through.   Ali looks slow. Older. \nINT. RING - PROFILE:       ALI + FRAZIER \nFrazier, off his bobbing and weaving, launches his devastating left hook to Ali's head. Frazier is making the most of what he is: smaller. Ali clinches. \nVERY LOW:     FRAZIER + ALI \nThe referee separates them. Both men throw and miss...Ali on the right, Frazier on the left. Ali throws a hard left that catches Frazier but doesn't stop him. Now Frazier connects with a wild left hook into Ali's cheekbone. THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS... \nOVERHEAD:     ALI \nis knocked down onto his knee. Ruled a slip, he stands immediately and continues. Ali, backed against the rope again, blocks shots, pushes Frazier into the middle of the ring... \nALI SWINGS FRAZIER \naround.     But Frazier cranks his left.     ALI SEES IT COMING... ALI (to himself) Hook's comin'. Lean back, man! Move back! WORK LEGS...! \nBut Ali's legs DON'T work fast enough. Frazier's hook CRASHES into Ali's face. Ali goes rubbery as he backs to the rope. Ali comes out and backs to the rope on the other side, with cartoon rubbery legs. But the mimicry is camouflage. He really is wobbling. The crowd is going wild. We HEAR everything, now. \nFRAZIER \nis wary. He doesn't trust Ali. He walks across the ring, allowing Ali to recuperate...THE BELL. Ali walks to his corner, drained... \nHOWARD COSELL (V.O.) Ali was out! He was out on his feet. Joe almost had him. Frazier must have thought Ali was playing possum. 'Cause Ali's a clown. Others have come in on Ali when he's playing possum and gotten knocked out. \nAli saved himself with GUILE. \nROUND FIFTEEN: \nThey clinch. They separate. They both...as if mirror images of each other...crouch, looking for shots. Ali's right is down. Frazier's right is down. As they both rise up out of the crouch, Frazier's out of the box first. Ali's right is coming around. Frazier's left hook slams Ali across the jaw. Ali goes down. Half the crowd ROARS for Frazier. Ali gets right up and stands in the corner and takes the mandatory eight-count. The right side of his face is swollen like a balloon. They resume... \nOVERHEAD:    ANOTHER CLINCH \nAli takes another right, but the ropes hold him up. Another left catches Ali. Frazier's face is a grotesque, swollen mask. He doesn't care. \nALI I can move my jaw with my tongue. He got me... \nPacheco looks into his mouth. \nPACHECO (concerned) It's broke. I think...I think your jaw's broke. \nMeanwhile, Ali spots... \nREFEREE \ncurious about the activity in Ali's corner, starts over... \nPACHECO nods to Dundee. Dundee starts to reach. Ali snatches Angelo's hand holding the towel. Angelo's about to end the fight... \nALI Ain't stoppin' nothin'...! (glares at them) Nothin' stoppin'...! \nA BELL sounds and Ali goes out to fight in an OVERHEAD SHOT. \nBURN OUT TO WHITE: \nINT. SAN DIEGO SPORTS ARENA, ALI AND HIS CORNERMEN + SECURITY - NIGHT \nleave the ring and another defeat, as they move up the aisle towards the locker room... \nINT.

(to TV) \nOVER ALI:    CONSOLE TV \nThey watch the Frazier-Foreman fight from Jamaica amid the wonderful chaos generated by kids and their toys, who crawl all over Ali as if he were furniture. Frazier and Foreman are in the center of the ring... We SEE Don King in Frazier's corner. \nALI (through still-wired- together jaw) Foreman call me one time after he won the Olympics... \nMeanwhile, Frazier bobs and weaves, ducks and moves like he did with Ali. Joe throws a left hook, leaning forward with it. Before it lands, Foreman unleashes a hard right that jolts Frazier SIDEWAYS. Frazier throws another hook that misses. Foreman hits him with a combination of right and three lefts...two hooks and an uppercut that LIFTS FRAZIER OFF THE GROUND. Ali leans in to SEE... \nHOWARD COSELL (shouting) DOWN GOES FRAZIER! DOWN GOES FRAZIER! \nON TV:    THE RING \nFrazier stands. The referee does the mandatory eight-count. Foreman bangs Frazier into the corner and blasts him again. Frazier tries to muscle out of the corner. Foreman lifts and throws him back into the corner. Foreman's power is unreal. Frazier is the man who beat Ali. Now, Frazier feints and slides sideways, and Foreman hits him in the back of the head. Frazier goes down again. It is savage. Here is a new world champion: George Foreman. \nBINGHAM (wry) B-b-be easy gettin' a Frazier fight now. He ain't the champ of anything except getting knocked down. \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN (ALI-FRAZIER II) - HANDS + ARMS - NIGHT \ngrabbing. Holding. Ali's got Joe's powerful left tied up this time. A clinch. Separating. A punch. A hook. Clinching. They separate... \nOVER JOE: \nAli, having Joe at the right range, hits him. Joe moves in. Ali DRAGS him closer and ties him up. They dance... \nTHEIR BODIES \nAli does a little shuffle, circles to keep Joe at hitting distance, lands a combination. Joe closes, but Ali won't let him in and ties up Joe. We hear a BELL and that's the end of the fight. Not a bang; a whimper. \nREFEREE \nholds up Ali's hand and mouths silently words we cannot hear. And as we MOVE CLOSER INTO ALI'S EYES, we see no exaltation. This is a victory, but a hollow one. It's a decision eked out. \nINT. NEW YORK COFFEE SHOP - WIDE \nThe inner circle:    Ali, Pacheco, Dundee, Bundini, Bingham. \nALI So. \nANGELO DUNDEE So we only eked this one out. And George Foreman makes Frazier look like a sissy. \nPACHECO You see their fight? \nHOWARD BINGHAM You mean the Joe Frazier falling- down lesson? \nPACHECO And Foreman is 24. You are 32 years old. I don't want to see your head get turned into someone's bull's-eye. \nANGELO DUNDEE ...but, you go? We're the corner, same as always. But it ain't gonna be easy. \nALI (to Angelo) You think I still got the tools? \nANGELO DUNDEE You got the tools, Daddy.     But they different. \nALI (thinks; decides: go) Well, you better sharpen 'em up. 'Cause we goin' to Africa. BUNDINI The motherland. From the root to the fruit. We gonna rumble...in the jungle. \nALI It's time to be heavyweight champion of the world again. \nBUNDINI Yeah, man! \nINT. NEW YORK PRESS CONFERENCE - DAY \nenters from his bungalow. We SEE we're in a compound. They are white and severely truncated houses linked by sidewalks and too many large street lamps. As Ali starts to jog through this imitation of suburbia with the scale all wrong. It's like a Gulag in reverse for the rich and powerful to be within while keeping the rest of the country out. As Ali passes, REVEAL we are at the bank of the Congo River. As Ali starts his predawn run, across the river the first band of magenta tints the horizon and reflects molten on the water. \nTRACKING SHOT:    ALI + DUNDEE, SARRIA IN A PICKUP TRUCK - RED DAWN \nplus two trainers and the ever-present Zairian POLICEMAN, Lt. Nsakala. The early paints the red-earth ochre. \nALI (to himself) Fast. Six left jabs flash from his chest and shoulder, followed by a right hook and left and right uppercuts. \nALI (CONT'D) (to himself) Back up, maaan... (weaves suddenly; another voice) ...you fast! \nAli slides to the right and throws a left jab and hooks off the jab. EXT. KINSHASA ROAD - EMPTY ROAD - MORNING LIGHT \nAli ENTERS, running. The road is lined with Mobutu's green billboards in French and English, proclaiming Zaire wonderful. A few kids emerge from behind the signs, coming out from between...and they trail Ali. \nKIDS Ali, boma ye! \nALI (repeating) Ali, boma ye George Foreman! \nAnd he throws a couple at an imaginary George Foreman. There are 15 to 16 kids, now. \nALI (CONT'D) You out, sucker! Curious, Ali runs behind the green signs from where the kids came. \nALI'S \nstill jogging. Behind the signs, he becomes a magnetic attraction. People are surprised to see Ali. He's making their day. Euphoric kids parallel him, run with him, follow him... \nPAST ALI: \nthe concrete-and-cinder-block walls to the dusty, bare ground are chromatic. Primary colors. Ethnographically interesting. \nALI SEES interiors. Broken walls. No roof. No plumbing. People come from a ditch with a shower curtain for privacy, surprised to see Ali. Faces indifferent to squalor. This is the ethnographically \"interesting\" surface of what, in fact, is civic disintegration starting to occur... It is the human concomitant to 13 years of Mobutu kleptocracy. \nALI \nlooks at the backs of the signs. He and we realize the signs' purpose: to hide the makeshift plastic walls and rooms made from cardboard containers and oil drums from the foreigners traveling the road to Kinshasa. One TEENAGER WITH A WITHERED ARM and a big smile runs up... \nTEENAGER (broken English) You beat them, Ali! \nALI Foreman?   I kill him! \nHe mimes knocking out Foreman. Something powerful is affecting Ali. We don't know what it is. Ali slows down... \n...throws two lightning jabs and a hook. Ali reaches to the kid's head and pulls a coin. He flips it to another kid and walks on. A SECOND TEENAGER comes out and wants Ali to look at something around the back. He takes Ali's hand...and holds it. Ali complies. The entourage follows... \nAROUND CORNER:   KIDS' PAINTING ON WALL \nIt's an imitation fight poster. Childlike caricatures in Basquiat-like brush strokes. Foreman's got crosses for eyes. He's out! Ali is victorious! His fist is raised. His cartoon face shouts his victory...the people's champion. There's more. There's knocked-out white policemen, knocked- out black soldiers, knocked-out landlords, knocked-out South Africa, knocked-out planes and tanks, knocked-out tse-tse flies...everything! \nSo much, it means \"ALL\"...all expectation. This childish painting powerfully affects Ali. The kids look at him. It's still. Some kids in the back leap up in the air to see over taller heads what Ali's doing. \nALI \nlooks at individual faces. A grinning OLDER MAN with a blue transistor radio (we'll see him later). A smiling kid. A girl with no shoes. A teenage kid jumping up and down...all looking at him. Ali makes four pieces of rope appear. He rubs them together... \nALI (CONT'D) Shazaam!!! \nThey become one. Everybody goes nuts. As Ali leaves, his eyes go back to the people and the painting... \nEXT. KINSHASA ROAD - ECU:   ALI'S FACE - MORNING (GREEN SCREEN) \nALI (to himself) ...even if I die here. If it kill me, no matter what...I gotta win. \nConcentration has taken him into the athlete's zone, the state of unified awareness wherein dwells his total self- knowledge. And he knows the transaction: what they give him with their adoration, which he converts to power, is in exchange for what he means to them. And what he means to them is specific: he represents them in defying power and vanquishing what oppresses. He validates the existence of expectation, that struggle is possible...George Foreman, mute and unknowingly, represents disinterested power. Ali doesn't \"accept\" his obligation; he embraces it. It is his purpose, revealed. And he will never waver from it. \nCUT TO: \nINT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, ANTEROOM (KINSHASA) - ALI - DAY \nwaits, sitting on a table edge in a corridor. Noise of a press conference setting. Howard Cosell crosses through, smoking. Bingham enters and gestures...they're ready. Ali waves off Bingham, stops Cosell... \nALI Howard! How many you ugly sportswriters in there got me over Foreman? Don't lie. \nHOWARD COSELL (beat) Some of us...Norman, me...are worried. How you gonna dance against George?? He's sparring with a middleweight, training to cut you off. He gets you against the ropes, he can knock you out with either hand. \nALI (drops facade) What's the odds? \nHOWARD COSELL Two-and-a-half-to-one. Against. We're worried you're going to get hurt. \nNo one thinks Ali will win. \nINT. INTERCONTINENTAL HOTEL, MEDIA CONFERENCE ROOM - CLOSE: ALI - DAY \nALI This'll be the biggest upset since Sonny Liston. I want all of you to write it down! This fight is no contest! \nWe've jammed into the middle of Ali in a blast of braggadocio. ALI (CONT'D) George Foreman is a big mummy. I've officially named him \"The Mummy.\" \nLaughter. \nALI (CONT'D) George punches are like \"Look out, here come the left.\" Whomp! (stiff-armed swing) Here come the right! Whomp! Like a Mummy. But \"The Mummy\" can't hit what it can't see. I'm fast! Gonna dance. Be all over George. George is gonna feel he surrounded. (beat) And I done somethin' new for this fight; I done rassled with an alligator. Anticipatory laughter. They've had twelve years' experience of Ali's stand-up and know when a new routine's starting... \nALI (CONT'D) That's right! (laughter again; Ali almost loses it) I have rassled with an alligator. I done tussled with a whale. I done handcuffed lightning, thrown thunder in jail. That's bad! Only last week I murdered a rock. Injured a stone. Hospitalized a brick. I'm so mean, I make medicine sick. \nLaughter. \nBELINDA (CONT'D) Maryum is sick. Maybe I oughta go back to Chicago and look after her. \nALI Sure. \nBELINDA I'll be back before the fight. (sarcastic) If that's all right, my husband... \nHe walks out the door. \nCUT TO: \nEXT. KINSHASA ARENA - 75 ZAIRIAN TRIBAL DANCERS - NIGHT \nto percussion.      The number. \nALI, \nAngelo and Bingham in the empty seating, looking at the ring under the canopy. Behind them is the rehearsal. Meanwhile... \nCUT TO: \nEXT. ARENA, ENTRANCE - TWO CARS \narrive, including in the first an Interpreter, Zairian Official #2, a Policeman Driver; and in the second car is Don King, Herbert, VERONICA, and another American Woman (silent bit). They're in a hurry... \nEXT. ARENA - ALI \nis being taught to dance by two dancers. They fail. In the background, workers are raising gigantic Mobutu portraits. The Pointer Sisters begin. \nAISLE \nDon King and entourage approach. \nDON KING (over the drumming) Champ! Champ! George had an accident. \nANGELO DUNDEE (suspicious) What are you talking about? \nPointer Sisters start \"Yes, We Can Can.\" \nDON KING Got cut. Right above his right eye. His sparring partner's elbow. Split it open, so... \nANGELO DUNDEE Can he fight? \nDON KING Not for six weeks. \nAli laughs. \nDON KING (CONT'D) This is not a humorous situation, my champion. This postponement could be long, especially if George leaves. \nANGELO DUNDEE Are you tryin' to pull something, Don? Ali wants his title. And he wants it back in Zaire. George leaves, he ain't comin' back. George don't like it here. \nPointer Sisters' rehearsal cuts...re-organizes. \nDON KING How right you are, my suspicious and short Italian brother. And my fiduciary responsibility to this first all-black promotion is like a garden in the African sun. It must grow! It must bloom! It cannot flower in the gloom and shade of postponement to some dome. Like the Astrodome, the Super-dome, any dome outta Zaire, where it be deprived of light and bled of water. 'Cause what gonna bleed...is money. A hemorrhage of cash. (sees it all) ...blood on the floor. Double hotel costs. Double travel costs. Airplanes. Food and beverage... \nANGELO DUNDEE (rhetorical) What do you expect us to do, Don? \nDON KING (moves close to Ali) Muhammad. Find a way to get George to stay. Be Moses in reverse: do NOT let my people go! Stay the fuck right here, in Egypt, if you'll pardon my Swahili. \nBINGHAM L-l-l-lingala. \nDON KING What? \nBINGHAM Lingala.   They s-s-s-speak Lingala. \nDON KING Who cares? \nPointer Sisters probably end here.   After a beat, percussion starts up. Dancers drift in. \nANGELO DUNDEE (pissed, dissed big) If George goes? You forfeit five million. You crawl back to Cincinnati. You ain't promotin' a charity raffle... \nWe see Herbert watching all of this closely...particularly the challenge to Ali/Dundee. \nDON KING (irrepressible) If George goes? George goes, my champion, I will get you Joe Frazier. Ali-Frazier III...the fight everybody want to see. INT. PRESS CONFERENCE \nALI (interrupts) Truth is...George knocked hisself out. \nDon King laughs, nervously.   Ali is daring George to stay. \nALI (CONT'D) That's right. He did three rounds. Knew he was gonna lose to Muhammad Ali and knocked hisself out. And I predict that whenever the fight is set, he might not show up! \nDON KING (double entendre) You bad! \nALI I'm a bad man! \nDON KING Ain't no doubt about it. \nALI And you tell the same thing to George. \nMedia laugh, Don King goes along, Ali continues... \nALI (CONT'D) (to King) I been watchin' you! I heard you. I know he's your man. I know you got him picked. But the man's in trouble. (MORE) \nALI (CONT'D) The whole world was gonna know. But, now, he ain't gonna show. That's why he knocked hisself out when he was training. \nALI You been to Hong Kong?   Taiwan? Thailand? \nVERONICA No. \nALI I can't go there. All the ladies out there from Indonesia, Japan, Hawaii, India... (high-pitched voice, imitating female fans) \"Ali-i-i-e-e-e! Ali-e-e-e! Oh, Muhammad Al-i-i-i!\" (speaks in faux foreign language, imitating female fans; to Bingham) You seen those people from Thailand? I was in Bangkok -- I couldn't walk. (laughter; hangs his head) I couldn't...I just couldn't do nothin'. \"Get me outta this country!\" (laughter) The women were so pretty... \nBINGHAM 'B-b-b-bout Hong Kong, man?!   You know what I heard? \nALI (interrupts) Ladies in Thailand, their hair comes down to their knees...and they about Veronica's complexion...and they bad! (MORE) \nALI (CONT'D) But they ain't nothin' like the \"sisters.\" (holds Veronica's hands, looks deep into her eyes) Ain't NOTHIN' like the sisters! \nVeronica laughs as Ali mocks swooning over her...   Another news crew arrives. \nNEWS CAMERAMAN Champ... \nALI (to Veronica) Let's go for a ride. \nEXT. KINSHASA SHANTYTOWN - KIDS - DUSK INTO NIGHT \nand old people, teenagers in dirty T-shirts with strange hats. Their eyes are wide. \nREVERSE:   ALI \nshows his bare hands. Now he rubs them together and MAGICALLY pulls from his closed fist a colored scarf.     The kids scream. \nVERONICA \nsquints, trying to figure out how he did it, because... \nALI \nshows the scarf, pushes back his cuffs so that he can't hide anything up his sleeves. His wrists are bare. He shows both sides. Now, he takes the scarf and pushes with his right hand and feeds it into the closed fist of his left. He looks up wide-eyed at everybody. Then, he opens his fingers and the scarf is not there! \nALI + VERONICA \nwalk, towering over the kids. One girl holds Ali's hand. The others maintain a respectful proximity so that they don't invade the space around Ali. \nALI So why you glad we still here? \nVERONICA Holdin' this in Africa make people proud. All over the world. They're proud of you. Anybody can fight in Vegas. \nALI That's one job.    I got two... \nThey pass through cinder-block houses, shipping crates, oil drums for cooking fires, a few car parts. \nALI (CONT'D) (melodramatic) ...gotta whup George! \nVERONICA Islamic faith help you to that? \nALI Listen, girl, as a Muslim, I am busted out and failed in the eyes of God. I shoulda discovered Islam at 50! 'Cause I am weak on women. They take my eyes and my heart follow...causing me to be a lovin' husband and a terrible husband...! (looks down at her, intensely) ...green eyes and cocoa skin...? (feigns wobbly legs) ...okay, rest of me, let's go!! \nVeronica laughs. She brings his hand up to her mouth and kisses it. Hand in hand, a towering man and a towering woman walk away at their ease against the soft sky with their entourage of teenagers and kids. On the perimeter, a kid does flips and, then, gets distracted... \nINT. N'SELE GYM - SPEED BAG - DAY \nA syncopated, obscuring, blurred shape of the bag turned into a percussion instrument by Ali's fast hands trying to get even faster. \nALI (to himself) Faster! Faster! \nDUNDEE (shouts) TIME! \nAli SLAMS a right hook at the bag. It almost explodes. OPTIONAL: Ali takes body hits, tries sliding off head shots. \nINT. RING - ALI'S EYES \nfeints his left and throws a right.   It surprises Holmes. \nHOLMES You can't lead a right hand.   Not at him! \nALI Why not? \nHOLMES Too long...to get it there. Man, I mean, to think you could hit him with a right lead...it's insulting... Nobody would lead a right... \nAli sees something beyond the ring. And, now, flicks four ripping left jabs into Holmes and slides sideways as Holmes tries to catch Ali with a right. But Ali changes directions, changes back and now comes over Holmes' right with his own left cross, and a six-or-seven-punch combination. It is Ali dancing and floating. Crowd cheers...\"TIME.\" \nBUNDINI \nmeanwhile, has thrown his arms around Dick Sadler, Foreman's manager. (We realize this is why Ali segued from serious work to snapping his traditional left jab.) \nBUNDINI I got him! Lock him up. \nSADLER (laughs) Hey, hold up, chump!   Make this chump turn me loose. \nSadler's there with his wife and another couple. Rudy joins, laughing. Bundini turns loose Sadler. Ali and Sadler like each other. \nSADLER (CONT'D) This is my wife, Irene... \nSadler affectionately puts an arm around Ali's neck and reaches up and pretends to hit Ali on top of the head with a fist for Bingham's camera. Ali bites his lower lip and starts wrestling with Sadler, putting him in a headlock. Sadler's arm is around Ali's waist. \nALI Hey! Look! Look at George Foreman's trainer, feelin' me up on purpose! On the side, to see if I'm in shape! \nMore laughter.     Sadler's beret falls off.   Rudy puts it back on. \nOVERHEAD \nas Ali, Foreman and both their crews meet in the center of the ring. \nCLAYTON Now, both of you know the rules. When I step back, I want a good, clean break. (Clayton keeps going) No hitting below the belt, no kidney punches, no... \nALI Motherfucker, you 'bout to discover you ain't nothin'. \nCLAYTON Ali, be quiet! \nGeorge's eyes glare.    Ali rocks back and forth, ready to rumble. \nCLAYTON (CONT'D) No kidney punches. Now... \nALI (past the ref; eyeballing George) You been hearin' about me for years. All your life you been hearin' about Muhammad Ali. Now you gotta face me. \nCLAYTON Ali, I'll disqualify you. Now, I want a good, clean, sportsman fight... \nALI (to Foreman) You never should have come to Africa. \nForeman is unfazed by all of this.    His cold eyes say \"battery and homicide.\" \nCLAYTON (blows up) All right!! (beat) Now go to your corners and come out fighting when you hear the bell, and may the best man...win... \nDISSOLVE TO: \nAli turns his back and continues to shuffle and shadowbox. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nOVERHEAD:    ALI + FOREMAN'S \ncorners are clear. Ali is facing his corner, praying to Allah. Foreman is bent over at the waist, flexing and releasing the last tension in his huge shoulders, as the bell for ROUND ONE clangs... \nTHE RING - BOTH \ncharge out and stop as if they ran into a brick wall five feet from each other. Then Ali dips, throws a left, which George takes on the shoulder...a BIG RIGHT HAND to George's head. The crowd goes nuts. George clinches, picks up Ali and swings him through 180 degrees with his power. As he puts Ali down, Ali pushes George's head down and away and Ali clocks him with ANOTHER RIGHT. Foreman clinches and drives Ali back to the rope. Ali throws ANOTHER RIGHT that lands. Ali dances, circles, stays out of Foreman's way. Then he slams him again with a right. \nForeman gets Ali in the corner, throws vicious combinations and a hook that nails Ali in the body and a wild shot hits Ali on the side of the head. CLOSER ON ALI...stunned, his eyes clear. He's just taken a Foreman shot. He pushes Foreman, the stronger man, out of the way and dances and circles. Foreman ties him up again. Ali pushes out, dances and hits HIM with a RIGHT. Ali ties him up, and there's the BELL. \nALI'S CORNER:     ALI \nALI (to himself) Legs heavy...air's heavy...like sand... \nSLOWLY MOVE IN ON ALI as Angelo and Bundini's talk fades away. We see Ali's awareness in a deep concentration. He is holding counsel with himself. Ali stares into space across the diagonal to the other corner, but not really at Foreman. Ali is weighing something. A gamble. He blinks, and whatever it is, he's decided it NOW. AMBIENT SOUND starts to come back as Ali's attention returns to the present and he ignores... \nANGELO DUNDEE ...keep moving. Don't let him put you into the corner. Stay off the rope! \nTHE BELL FOR ROUND TWO \nAli charges into the center of the ring, provoking Foreman to chase him, and Ali immediately BACKS TO THE ROPE. And stays there! Seizing opportunity, Foreman throws big hooks. ALI IS DOING EXACTLY WHAT HE'S NOT SUPPOSED TO DO. He gets off the rope and backs to the rope on the other side. Most of the shots are blocked by the gloves of both men. No damage. Then George throws a left, which Ali blocks, and a big right hook. \nALI \nturns away.     Nevertheless, it crashes into his jaw. \nMACRO ALI \nTIME SLOWS. He ties up George. We SEE Ali's hurt.        Dazed. But he must make George believe he's unhurt. \nALI That all you got...?   That it? \nForeman reacts. Ali takes vicious hooks to the midsection, hangs on and goes right back onto the ropes, tying Foreman up. \nLOW ANGLE \nGeorge's shots are taken on Ali's elbows and gloves. But for every four that are thrown, one or two tremendous hooks get through to Ali's ribs, his side. \nALI'S FACE \nreveals impact, but nothing diminishes the TERRIBLE FORTITUDE with which he endures. Now, he ties up George. Now, George drives Ali into the corner and pummels him. \nANGELO + BUNDINI going crazy in the corner! \nANGELO DUNDEE Get off the ropes! Get off the ropes! Get off the ropes! Dance! \nAli blocking, getting hit.   WORRIED FACES in the crowd.       One woman looks away. \nALI'S EYES \nalive, more than alert, the sharpest eyes in boxing. \nFOREMAN'S LEFT JAB \ncoming in.   Ali feints, shifts.   It misses by a quarter of an inch. \nFOREMAN HOOKS OFF HIS JAB Ali leans back on the top rope. Foreman's punch falls short and connects with little effect. That's how good is Ali. The techniques BECOME CLEAR. \nForeman goes upstairs, throws three hooks, all get taken on Ali's gloves. Foreman slams a hook that began in Cape Town and ends up in Zaire, into Ali's abdomen. And another. Ali takes the shots, hangs on. \nALI'S EYES \nare bright like stars.   His white mouth guard shines.     A grimace? A grin? \nALI comes off the rope, and Ali hits Foreman with a terrific three-shot combination, a right-left-right. WHAM-WHAM-WHAM. \nFeints.   Hits Foreman with a left-right.   WHAM-WHAM! \nALI (CONT'D) C'mon, chump!!! \nThe BELL. It's an Ali rally at the end. He throws Foreman a look of contempt as he walks to his corner. \nALI'S CORNER \nANGELO DUNDEE (panicked) Get off the goddamn ropes!! \nALI Took somethin' away from him, Angie, that round... \nBUNDINI You gotta move! Stick and MOVE! \nALI (to himself) They don't know what's happenin'. \nAli looks to the left and sees Jim Brown. \nALI (CONT'D) (to Jim Brown) You bet the wrong horse! He can't fight no better than you can act! \nJim Brown laughs. \nWE DON'T HEAR A BELL. INSTEAD, WE'RE SUDDENLY IN THE LAST 15 SECONDS OF ROUND FOUR. EXT. RING, ROUND FOUR, FIVE, SIX - FOREMAN BARRAGE \nAli is braced on the ropes, as far back as the ropes will go. Foreman throws a barrage of shots, he slams in five and six at a time. THE BELL. \nALI \ncovers with gloves at his head. Elbows at his ribs. When head shots come in, Ali slips them the right or left, or turns them into glancing shots, or just leans straight back so that they all fall short by quarter of an inch. The BELL. \nALI \ncovering, taking the most powerful hooks Foreman's thrown in the fight, one after the other to the body. \nALI (to himself) Take it! Terrify him with what you can take... \nAli's eyes are stars. He sees everything. He sees things no one else can see in the quantum physics of deflecting the force of Foreman's blows. \nFOREMAN \ndesperate, pounds a left to Ali's side, a blocked left to the head, three lefts to the belly, which get through! Ali's left arm convulses downwards, involuntarily, with the blows. What Ali's not ready for and doesn't block is the right hand that follows. This shot is jarring and concussive. He grabs Foreman's neck and has to hold on. \nThe BELL. \nEXT. RING - ALI - MID-ROUND SEVEN \nleaning way back at impossible angles -- soaking up George's shots. George is SLOWER...BUT Ali's not throwing at all! \nALI (hisses to George) Eight more rounds... You runnin' outta gas? \nThen...Ali comes out from under. \nWHAM.     WHAM.     WHAM.   WHAM.     WHAM. \nFive hard shots are followed into Foreman's puffed face. They surprise and enrage him. WIDER:     GEORGE \ndrives Ali with his 220 pounds...George's arms and fists now SWING HEAVILY. Some get through. Ali's right eye is puffy. Both tie up. And BELL ends the round. \nEXT. RING - ALI'S CORNER \nAngelo and Bundini talk.            Neither we nor Ali hear them. \nALI (to himself to George) ...can't let you get that second wind which you don't know is out there for you. (MORE) \nALI (CONT'D) (talking to George in his head) Want the title...wear the heavyweight crown? (to himself) Jaw broke? Nose smashed? Face busted? You ready to die? Is that you? (towards George) 'Cause you gonna meet a man who will die before he let you win. \nA tall African Girl walks by with the number \"8.\" As she passes near Ali, she has the audacity to wink at him. ALI happens to see it. He winks back at her. She smiles. He brightens right up! THE BELL RINGS. \nEXT. RING - ALI \ngoes to the ropes, throws a couple and, now, comes off the ropes. He's in the center of the ring. HE'S HUNTING. A couple of lefts from Ali. Foreman throws a haymaker and almost falls out of the ring. Ali's in the corner, having avoided the shot. \nFOREMAN \ngets in a couple of lefts that Ali deflects. Ali takes another on the cheek, leans way back again. Suddenly, he seems tired, as is Foreman. Tied up, they go diagonally to the other corner of the ring, both fighters exhausted, leaning against each other. Resting. BUT... \nEXTREMELY CLOSE:   WE SEE ALI'S EYES ARE DEAD SHARP \nHe's faking. \nFOREMAN \nbacks Ali into the corner. \nALI \nhits Foreman with a left. Foreman launches a short left that Ali counters with a BIG RIGHT CROSS that connects. \nFOREMAN'S \nhead snaps around. Sweat sprays in a parabola of light. Crowd ROARS with expectation. George Foreman tries a right uppercut, fails as Ali circles, guiding Foreman onto the ropes. Foreman's on the ropes NOW. \n", "test1_input": "enters. Stands at the dresser.

Meanwhile...a phone rings. Bundini answers while... \nA.D. (re: newspaper, to Ali) ...you gonna try for Germany? \nALI Huh? \nA.D.

You have the right to be called whatever you want. \nALI (stays angry) You make a lot of mistakes for a so-called educated man. You really go to law school? \nHOWARD COSELL Yes, Muhammad. And to think I gave up a lucrative practice for the likes of you. \nALI I'm the best thing that ever happened to you, Howard Cosell. Without me you be a tall white man with a microphone in his mouth. \nHOWARD COSELL (fast) And without me...you'd be a mouth. \nAli lifts Howard's toupee.

ABC TELEVISION STUDIO, BACKSTAGE - ALI + COSELL - LATER \nAli pours three spoons of sugar in his coffee. \nHOWARD COSELL (sarcastic) Have a little coffee with your sugar...? \nALI Keep talking. You were saying something half-smart... \nHOWARD COSELL They want to make an example out of you. \nALI Why? I'm no Stokely Carmichael, H. Rap Brown... \nHOWARD COSELL All they are is political. They tell people how they ought to be. But you are the HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMPION of the WORLD. You're important. And they don't like your militancy, your politics.

Rudy and SIX LARGE MUSLIMS escort Ali through the crowd of media trucks, reporters and conspicuous unmarked police cars and neighborhood people. \nALI \nwaves in Robert Lipsyte, the New York Times sportswriter in his late 20's we've seen before. He and Howard Bingham, waiting inside, know each other. They enter. The phone's already RINGING. \nINT. HOLIDAY INN ROOM + BALCONY - ALI \non the phone, on a long extension, joined by Lipsyte and Howard Bingham, while Bundini keeps at bay reporters at the front door. It all feels like a rock group in town for a concert. \nALI (listens; to cam.) Ask Chauncey Eskridge in Chicago. He's my lawyer. No. I'm out on bail. (goes onto balcony [rear shot]) Yeah, I fight. I fight clean. I'm an athlete. Army's there to kill, kill, kill. My religion forbids that. No. I never shot anything in my life. (turns) Do I know where Vietnam is? (wry; playing to Bingham) Yeah. It's on TV... (beat) In southeast Asia? It there, too? (beat) That's a joke, man...! \nAli hangs up.   The phone rings again. \nALI (CONT'D) (frustrated) What do I think about who?      Vietcong? \nNext is something Ali has not deduced. Ali perceives it intuitively and reflexively. As with other of his decisions, once made, he doesn't hesitate to speak them. And he won't waver. He says... \nALI (CONT'D) Man, I ain't got no quarrel with them Vietcong. \nIt goes dead silent.   Ali listens.   Lipsyte is stunned. So's Howard. \nALI (CONT'D) No Vietcong ever called me nigger. \nBINGHAM You know what you j-j-just said...? \nHe hangs up. \nLIPSYTE From Europe to China...every home in America...the world's gonna know what the heavyweight champion of the world said about the U.S. war... \nALI So what? (beat) I ain't gonna be what anybody else want me to be. I'm not afraid to be what I want. And think how I want. \nAnd that's the real Ali, right there. \nINT. HOLIDAY INN, ALI'S SUITE - ALI - NIGHT \nlaying on the sofa. Dundee, Pacheco and Rudy have joined. There's the feeling the house is a bunker. Phones ring. Television is on. LIPSYTE, taking notes, watching Walter Cronkite on TV. He crosses to Ali. Dundee's on the phone. LIPSYTE (reading) Nixon, the Republicans, Boxing Commission in New York, Cleveland and L.A. (a foregone conclusion) But you're also getting attacked as unpatriotic by the NAACP, Roy Wilkins, Jackie Robinson, the New York Times and Joe Louis... \nThe expression on Ali's face is blank, as if he's accepting a pounding: he knows what it is; it's not a surprise. \nINT. GRANT PARK UNDERGROUND GARAGE - QUIET - NIGHT \nA very low ceiling; we're in a green-lit cavern with a low ceiling. Chauncey Eskridge and Ali wait. Ali's in the backseat of a 1961 Lincoln. Two FOI guards stationed at the distant ramps allow a Black Oldsmobile to pass. \nBOB ARUM \na New York lawyer and promoter arrives and climbs out of the Oldsmobile. Ali opens the door...but doesn't get out... \nALI (to Arum) People are following me... \nBOB ARUM I got almost nowhere I can promote a fight for you. Plus, I think they're going to vacate you from the crown. \nALI What? \nBOB ARUM Yeah.   If you're convicted. \nALI They gonna take away what no fighter in the world can? \nBOB ARUM And New York may revoke your boxing license. \nCHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE You sure you want to do all this? (politics) Your next three to four years are every heavyweight's prime. And there are few of those years... \nALI What 'bout Terrell? \nBOB ARUM We'll know if we can fight Terrell in Illinois this afternoon. Terrell's running his mouth. He said if you're called, you should serve... \nALI (angrily) Motherfucker. He got a deferment for bein' too tall, or havin' flat feet. Why don't he serve for me? Tellin' me what I should do... \n", "test1_id": 714, "test2_input": "INT. ELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT \nElijah Muhammad reacts to the interview on television. There's a formality to Elijah Muhammad, even at his kitchen table. \nHOWARD COSELL You've made more money than all previous heavyweight champions combined. What about your management? Surely they have provided for you... \nALI I'm saying it's time for everybody to quit lying! Muhammad Ali is the champ! I have to, I'll get the fight on myself. (beat) And if they offer me money, I ain't gonna turn it down. \nCROSSCUT:    Elijah turns to an aide. \nELIJAH MUHAMMAD Get me my son, Herbert, on the telephone! \nINT.

He's breathing hard, struggling against time to hold onto shape and prowess. He seems vulnerable against the open sky and water. \nINT. TEMPLE #2 - NIGHT \nElijah Muhammad is at the lectern ringed by Fruit of Islam Guards. HERBERT is behind him. \nELIJAH MUHAMMAD Mr. Muhammad Ali desires to do that which the Holy Qur'an teaches him against. I am, therefore, suspending Mr. Ali from the practice of Islam. He may no longer appear in temple, pray or teach, or have any conversation with any Muslim whatsoever. Furthermore...he may no longer use the name of Muhammad Ali. Henceforward, he will revert to his old slave name, Cassius Clay. \nINT. JEFFREY ST. HOUSE, KITCHEN - ALI - DAY \nsits at the table. A deep vacancy is beginning to be there we've never seen before. May-may makes a mess. \nBELINDA Muhammad...? \nALI You can't call me that no more. \nBELINDA Hell, I can't. I'm defying them by talking to you. And being with you. \nMOVE CLOSER and CLOSER into Ali's eyes. He's oblivious. Belinda's pregnant again. She says something to him. Ali can't hear. She says it again, louder. Ali doesn't look at her. OVER ALI onto the Formica table with Log Cabin syrup and powdered sugar and ceramic salt and pepper shakers SEEN in his ECU, disconnected, depressed, withdrawn... \nINT. FLOPHOUSE, FOYER - ALI + BINGHAM - DAY \nentering, concerned and urgent... \nALI Whyn't you call an ambulance or a doctor? \nLANDLADY (following behind) Wouldn't let me. Said he knew you...and to call you, Mr. Ali... He's not been out for three days... \nAli's up the stairs, down the corridor and takes the key from the lady and opens the door. It's a dump. Rotting food, something burned on the stove. On the floor, wrapped in a threadbare bedspread, half in and out of the bathroom, which is foul, is Bundini, sleeping off a drunk. \nBINGHAM Bundini! \nBUNDINI (opens his eyes; half sits) Watchu' doin' here? Gimme that short dog! \nAli -- his concern crashes. He detests the type Bundini resembles. He throws a half-empty half-pint of Old Taylor against the wall. It splatters... \nALI What's wrong with you, man?! \nBUNDINI Nothin' wrong with me! \nAli goes to the curtains and pulls them back.    Bundini, blinded... \nBUNDINI (CONT'D) What that?!!! \nBINGHAM A mystery...d-d-d-daylight... \nBUNDINI (shielding his eyes) Leave me alone! \nALI I leave you alone.   You called me! \nBUNDINI That were a week ago... \nAli grabs Bundini's arm and twists it and pushes his sleeve up. Bundini tries to pull his arm away. Ali is way stronger. Track marks up and down Bundini's arm. Ali slaps Bundini on the side of the head. SMACK! He slaps him again. SMACK! \nALI What you shame yourself like this for, maaan...?! Why you shame yourself?! \nBundini flails back with his arms.    Ali leans in and SMACKS him again. \nBUNDINI Lemme alone! (shouts) I'm flyin'! The Sky Chief talk through me. I know the word! \nALI You know \"low.\" You so low, the curb look like up! \nBUNDINI (demonstrates) Yeah? The king gotta go home to his throne! From the root to the fruit...! \nALI Those rhymes is old.    Forget 'em. \nBUNDINI (demonstrates more) God don't care about you! Don't care about me! In all of everything, we mean nothin'. He don't know us. We be. And that's the onliest thing he did. And that's good 'cause that's why we free. But free ain't easy. Free is real. And realness is a motherfucker... (low; almost spooky) It eats raw meat. (beat) It walk in its own shoes. (beat) It does not waver... (pause) Yeah... \nThere's a pause in the room.    Bundini crashes.    He starts crying, unabashedly... \nBUNDINI (CONT'D) I sold your belt for five hundred dollars to a barber on Lenox Avenue. That's how low I did you. I'm filled with weakness and got a crazy mind. That belt say you the Heavyweight Champion of the World. Five hundred dollars and I put it into my arm. That's what I called to tell you... \nAli leans back against the wall...the last vestige, gone. \nBUNDINI (CONT'D) ...heard 'bout the Nation, all that court stuff. \n", "test2_true": "BUNDINI Forgive me, Muhammad.

Men gathered around 50-gallon steel drums, burning wood for warmth. Everything is corrupted or has left him. \nFRONTAL:    ALI \nstaring into nowhere. \nREVERSE:    PAST ALI The city recedes. Vectors, in perspective, carry structures, buildings away. The sky is grey, going to blue. The city flees and SUDDENLY disappears as we race into the dark tunnel of subway. Ali's lost in the depths of attempting a calculation. He can't do that for which he has a genius beyond other men... \nALI (to himself) ...you can't do what you do best in the world. And how you feed your family? From prison? Who take care of your kids? And is Allah, is God with me? \nAnd he's been exiled from the belief system that explained the universe to him. SUDDENLY LIGHTS slash across his face in the white-tile North Avenue station. BEYOND, ghostlike working men and two heavyset women enter. Ali turns aside to prevent being recognized. It's the first time he's ever avoided the public. The train lurches forward... \nOVER ALI:    WHITE LIGHT \nscreams away from us. Red reflects off the rails past Ali's face as we descend deeper into the tunnels. \nEXT. NEAR BROADCAST TRUCK - COSELL - NIGHT \nsteps out of the truck. There is a small crowd of people who turn as ALI pulls up in a convertible. He's solemn for a moment. Then he's out of the car... \nALI (O.S.) A thousand dollars to the man who brings me Howard Cosell's toupee! Dead or alive! \nReveal Ali next to his car. \nHOWARD COSELL (loud) Don't bother me. I'm a world- famous broadcaster and you're an ex-champion with diminished skills. I can't be seen you, it would be calamitous to my reputation. \nEXT. NEAR BROADCAST TRUCK - ALI + COSELL - LATER \nalone in the convertible parked in a distant corner of the lot. \nALI Put me on, Howard. HOWARD COSELL Muhammad, I'd do anything for you. But I got bosses who only give a damn about Nielsen ratings. \nALI I guarantee...it will be a historical and momentous night! \nINT. ABC-TV STUDIO \nAli being interviewed by Howard Cosell in the \"Wide World of Sports\" set. We've entered mid-scene... \nALI ...what Heavyweight Champion of the World? I'm not the champ. I am retired, finished, out of the game. And I ain't gonna let myself grieve and suffer none. But I know I will not fight again... \nHOWARD COSELL I thought you were resolute in your resolve to regain your crown... \nALI If tomorrow they say: \"We want you to fight Joe Frazier. Madison Square Garden. Millions and millionses of dollars. Here's your license back.\" I will tell them: \"I am sorry, but I am done.\" \nHOWARD COSELL What about Frazier? \nALI You'll have to wonder...what me and Smokin' Joe would have looked like. \nHOWARD COSELL You surprise me, Muhammad... \nALI Howard, you losing your hearing along with your hair? Don't put questions to it! (beat) I am through fighting. 'Cause I got a bigger and more important match comin' up. The U.S. government. A heavier contender. HOWARD COSELL Do you think you're going to jail? \nALI I don't know, but it's going to be a shocking and terrible fight. In fact, they might wish they let me stay in boxing. \nHOWARD COSELL Joe Frazier told me on this show he would knock you out. \nALI There you go, agitatin'. (beat) You ask Smokin' Joe what he been smokin'?! Joe Frazier even dream he can whup me? He better wake up and apologize... (pause) But, if I WAS to jump in the ring with Joe, here's what you might see... (recites) Ali comes out to meet Frazier, but Frazier starts to retreat; If Frazier goes back an inch farther, he'll wind up in a ringside seat; Ali swings with a left, Ali swings with a right. Frazier keeps backin', but there's not enough room. It a matter of time before Ali lowers the boom; Now Ali lands with a right, what (MORE) \nALI (CONT'D) a beautiful swing, But the punch lifts Frazier clean out of the ring. Frazier's still risin', but the referee wears a frown, 'Cause he can't start countin' 'til Frazier come down. And Frazier's disappeared from view. And the crowd is getting frantic. Then our radar stations pick him up. He's somewhere over the Atlantic. Who would have thought when they came to this fight, That they would witness the launching of a black satellite? \nThere's laughter off-camera in the studio and a wry smile on Cosell's face. \nALI (CONT'D) But don't wait for they fight. 'Cause it ain't never gonna happen. You only can wonder and imagine... \nThe phones in the master control booth and ringing off the hook...the public's reaction to Ali's Bre'r Rabbit routine. Ali used his ability to command presence in media to promote the only fight the public wants to see... \nEXT. CLAY HOUSE - CASSIUS, SR. - DAY \nALI (V.O.) You want me to buy you a drink? Ali's dad sits on a crate, painting the door of a delivery truck. He looks up...Ali is there. Emotion wells up in both men. The younger \"rebelistic\" son, seeing his father, who is so like him. The older hep-cat who got cheated by life of his potential and promise. In this case, his boy, his boy's name, pride and reflected glory... \nCASSIUS CLAY, SR. I don't drink no more. (squints at him) You wanna fight? \nALI I don't wanna fight no more.   Not with you... \nAs they embrace, Odessa comes out, watches them. \nEXT. BROAD STREET - PHILADELPHIA - DAY \nAli stands on the street corner, shades, incognito. A gold Cadillac pulls up: JOE FRAZIER. He is wearing a lemon yellow cowboy outfit, Stetson hat, striped pants. Ali looks at him in disbelief. \nALI Who dress you, Joe?   You look like Dale Evans. \nFRAZIER Shut up.    Get in. \n", "test2_id": 715, "test3_input": "BELINDA (CONT'D) Do you want to marry her? \nALI I follow my heart. \nBELINDA \"You're following your heart\"? (sarcasm falls away) That's what you do.

(after a beat) I didn't come this far to quit. \nBELINDA Neither of us did. \nAli looks at her a moment. Then he leaves. Silence. Belinda sits on the bed. She looks up. Then she comes apart. She rips open a closet. She finds Veronica's clothes, rips them, shreds peignoirs, overturns a night table, strips the bed, smashes more furniture, throws Veronica's suitcase at the mirror. It does not break. She looks around the wrecked room. Bingham is standing there. \nBINGHAM Belinda? \nBelinda looks up, tears in her eyes. \nBINGHAM (CONT'D) You can't beat him. You can't beat him, 'cause you can't not love him. \nINT. ALI'S HOUSE, N'SELE, SHOWER - ALI - NIGHT \nunder the water. It flows like silver down the contours of his face and neck.

The Banker? The American? \nMOBUTU'S MILITARY AIDE (in French) They are waiting in the sitting room. \nINT. ALI'S DRESSING ROOM - DUNDEE \nwrapping Ali's hands, tears the tape into narrow strips to go between the fingers. Doc Broadus, from Foreman's camp, observes the wrapping, then signs it. In addition to function, the taping feels ritualistic. \nCLOSE:    ALI'S \nattention is focused elsewhere...on his action:    what he will do, his strategy. \nLIEUTENANT NSAKALA (from doorway) Countdown! Countdown! \nRUDY Countdown is on, bro.   Five minutes. \nAli gets off the training table. Angelo has finished. He puts on his robe and starts warming up before the mirror, throwing punches for a full minute. \nHERBERT \nenters.    Ali and Herbert go to an alcove. \nALI Thanks to Allah... (praying) \nLIEUTENANT NSAKALA (shouts) Four minutes! \nSarria sticking sealed bottles filled with honey, orange juice and water into the water bucket. As Ali puts on the robe, the others gather up the gear, start out. Herbert moves to Ali, preparing for the entrance, to be as close to him for the cameras as possible... \nANGELO DUNDEE Give us a moment. Alone. (off Herbert's look) Hey. This is my religion! \nHerbert and Pat Patterson, the bodyguard, with his chrome- plated .45, follow the others away from Ali. Angelo begins applying Vaseline on Ali's face. They're alone in the room. \nANGELO DUNDEE (CONT'D) It's hot. Humid. Monsoon season's about to start. May hit 140 in the ring under the lights. You all right? \nALI Why? \nANGELO DUNDEE Where you at? \nALI (looks up) Foreman ain't no mummy. He's knocked out eight out of eleven before the end of the third round. He the most dangerous fighter I ever fought. \nANGELO DUNDEE I'd worry if I was hearin' anything else. \nAli loosens up his neck. \nALI And I can't WAIT! \nLIEUTENANT NSAKALA Three minutes! \nANGELO DUNDEE Dance.   That's the most important... \nAli looks at Dundee enigmatically.     Before Angelo can ask... \nBUNDINI \nthrows towels across Ali's shoulders. Ali puts on his long African robe, which is white with African-graphic trim on the cuffs of the sleeves and the hem. \nBUNDINI (whispers) Forget every battle of man against man, of mind against mind, of soul against soul.

The crowd roars. \nANOTHER ANGLE:      ALI dances back to his corner... \nANGELO DUNDEE George is playing prima donna.   He wants to make you wait. \nAli laughs. You won't psyche out Muhammad Ali with that stuff. Instead, Ali uses the time. He tests the ropes.

He looks up at the lights and gets used to the heat from them. \nALI'S FEET \ndo a shuffle. He feels the canvas. He feels the soft spots. The firm spots.

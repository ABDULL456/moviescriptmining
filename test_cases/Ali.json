A bald man, angrily: \nCOMMISSIONER You understand we could take away your license to fight Terrell in Illinois? \nALI Yes. \nCOMMISSIONER Are you prepared to apologize? About your unpatriotic remarks that you made? \nALI Apologize? No. \nCOMMISSIONER You said that you were the people's champion. \nALI (angry) Yes, sir! \nCOMMISSIONER Do you think you're acting like the people's champion...?! \nALI Yes, sir. I am not going to apologize to you. This isn't a courtroom. And I don't have to sit here and answer your questions. \nAli gets up and walks out on them.   Eskridge and NOI men in black suits follow. \nINT. CHICAGO OFFICE BUILDING - ALI + ENTOURAGE - DAY \nmarch through the lobby. Ali gives a walking interview. He's angry. He won't slow down. \nALI I ain't draft dodgin'! I ain't goin' to Canada. I ain't burnin' my draft card. I ain't burnin' the flag. I'm stayin' right here. And you want to throw me in jail? Go ahead. I'll do my time. I been in jail four hundred years. I'll be in jail four, five more. But I ain't goin' ten thousand miles to help murder and kill poor people for you. 'Cause if I'm gonna die, I'll die now, right here, fighting you. If I wanna die. You my enemy, not Vietcong or Chinese or Japanese. You my opposer when I want freedom.

THE HOUSTON ASTRODOME - CLOSE:   TERRELL - DAY \nERNIE TERRELL is taller than Ali. The empty stadium has a scale and press at one end. Girls in cowboy hats and lone stars say we're in Texas. Ali is distracted. \nERNIE TERRELL (getting on scale) Tell Clay he can get on after me. \nALI What...? \nERNIE TERRELL Get on the scale after... \nALI (cuts in) What you call me...? \nTerrell wrongly thinks there's psychological value in provoking Ali. \nERNIE TERRELL Only thing I knows you as:   Cassius Clay! \nALI (infuriated) Announce it right here or from flat on your back! \nAli throws a punch that doesn't land because he's separated. \nALI (CONT'D) What's my name?!? \nCLOSE ON ALI \nsomething else in his eyes. \nINT.

Ali, at the apex of his athletic skills, fires six- or eight-punch combinations and then changes direction. Ali shoots jabs and hooks going backwards; every move and set of combinations is a dance. Ali's never been as light on his feet, as fast, as complex as in this fight. Like any moment of greatness, we want it to last forever... Then, Ali throws a 17-punch combination. \nALI (CONT'D) WHAT'S MY NAME?! \n...that burns down Terrell. Terrell starts to fall. Ali moves away. He doesn't want it to end. Sportswriters don't like it. Half the fans don't like it. Ali defies both their sensibilities and their politics. \nTERRELL'S \nface is battered.    Ali SLAMS in SHOTS. \nALI (CONT'D) (shouted) My name?!

The jury has found you guilty of refusing induction into the United States armed forces. I sentence you to the maximum sentence allowable...five years' imprisonment and a fine of ten thousand dollars. (pause) Fast enough? Your attorney will lodge an appeal.

HOUSTON COURT, FOYER - ALI - DAY \n", "test1_true": "CLOSER - ALI \nlooks dazed, not sure how to act on the way out of court. Oddly, he shakes hands with each of a half a dozen white Houston Bailiffs. It's as if, benumbed by the verdict, he seeks human contact. The only contact available, ironically, is with the officers of the court that just convicted him. \nEXT. 79TH STREET, CHICAGO, 1968 - ALI - DUSK \nTime has passed. It's winter. Snow's on the ground. He's in a car coat and a hat with a hooded sweatshirt underneath. Street lights are on. Traffic's slight.

He leans across a white showcase of bakery goods. It's cold outside; warm inside. It smells of bread and coffee. BELINDA BOYD reacts. \nALI Watch now... \nHe makes a fist, balls the scarf up, and puts it in the hollow of his fist. \nALI (CONT'D) (offering) Blow on it... \nShe blows on it. She's not quite eighteen, six feet tall; there's a supremely confident expressiveness about her. Her gestures are large. He opens his hand. The scarf is gone. She instinctively looks over at his other hand. Nothing's there. His eyes go wide in mock fright at the mysterious. \nALI (CONT'D) This spooky! Don't get scared... \nShe laughs. How'd he do it? He makes a fist again, puts his thumb in the hollow. And slowly pulls the scarf out... \nBELINDA (laughs) See, you don't need to fight no more... \nHe gives it to Belinda. She ties it around her neck. Ali looks at her. On a cold and dark afternoon, the windows are steamed and the bakery seems a fine refuge. \nALI So what's fresh, girl? \nBELINDA (smiles) Everything fresh! \nALI (smiles) What's the freshest of the freshest? \nBELINDA (smiles) Doughnuts just came out... \nALI (holds up the doughnut) Feed me those things, I gotta come back as a wrassler. (a ring announcer) 645 pounds. I'd still be pretty...but I be fat pretty... \nBELINDA You don't remember when you met me once before...long ago... \nALI (joking) I remember something...   Wha's your name? \nShe slaps his arm. \nBELINDA You know my name! You came to my school, right before you win the title. Interviewed you for the school paper. I was eleven. \nALI You had a long braid... \nBELINDA Yeah! You called me little Indian girl, then. \nALI That was you? \nBELINDA I loved you then, like all those kids. I never stopped. I still do. \nINT. NATION OF ISLAM ASSEMBLY - ALI + BELINDA - DAY (FLASHBACK) \nELIJAH MUHAMMAD'S VOICE (OVER) (finishes) \nThe African-American Albert Speer-regimented seating breaks up. Ali's wearing a black suit, a white suit and white tie. As he drifts through the crowd, approaching him is Belinda in a white caftan and a white satin turban with gold earrings.

Ali takes a coffee in a paper cup and grabs a Danish. \nALI You see the Ellis-Quarry fight? \nCHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE Yes... We'll be in front of the U.S. Court of Appeals next month. We'll lose. Then we appeal to the Supreme Court. \nALI Ellis the champ? Man. I beatin' on him since we was sixteen. They give Ellis to Joe Frazier? Frazier'll kill him. Then they out of juice. Where's the gate? So they gotta let me fight. I fight Ellis in a phone booth...middle of Times Square...you think that draw a crowd? \nCHAUNCEY ESKRIDGE Draw a crowd or not draw a crowd, Muhammad, is NOT going to make a difference with your boxing licenses. They don't want you to fight. (so much for speculation) ACLU's handling your case against the New York Boxing Commission. They discovered New York's got actual ex-murderers and ex-rapists currently licensed to fight. But revoked yours...? \nALI Tijuana?

The announcer's hand takes it... \nANNOUNCER Ladies and gentlemen, fifteen rounds of boxing for the heavyweight championship of the world... \nALI looking out the hood of his robe, dancing, shaking it out, loosening up. \nANNOUNCER (CONT'D) ...the contender and former heavyweight champion of the world, seeking to regain his title, from Louisville, Kentucky, Muhammad Ali!!! \nCatcalls and boos. The other half is a comeback sound. It is a nation divided: pro-war right-wingers, Nixon supporters are for Frazier; the anti-war movement, celebrities, New York liberal establishment, blacks, Puerto Ricans and hippies are for Ali. \nANNOUNCER And in the opposite corner, the current heavyweight champion of the world, Smokin' Joe Frazier...! \nThe contentious roar diminishes only slightly for the announcer. \nALI'S EYES deep in his focused concentration. His attention so arrow like it reminds us of the younger man in the Liston fight...pure purpose. \nTHE RING \n...only SILENCE as the referee's instructions are given in SLO-MOTION. Ali bounces on the canvas. We HEAR his feet shift, turn, dance...and his breathing, expectant. Here comes the return of what was unfairly taken: his heavyweight championship. \nDISSOLVE TO: \nMID-FIGHT - ALI \nlooks swollen,      out of breath. Something's wrong! Two solid Ali jabs and a      right hook connect. But they slow down Frazier not at      all. Joe Frazier, short and compact, like a pit bull, bobs      and weaves his way inside Ali's longer reach. \nALI'S CORNER - DUNDEE + BUNDINI \nshouting instructions.        None get through.   Ali looks slow. Older. \nINT. RING - PROFILE:       ALI + FRAZIER \nFrazier, off his bobbing and weaving, launches his devastating left hook to Ali's head. Frazier is making the most of what he is: smaller. Ali clinches. \nVERY LOW:     FRAZIER + ALI \nThe referee separates them. Both men throw and miss...Ali on the right, Frazier on the left. Ali throws a hard left that catches Frazier but doesn't stop him. Now Frazier connects with a wild left hook into Ali's cheekbone. THE UNTHINKABLE HAPPENS... \nOVERHEAD:     ALI \nis knocked down onto his knee. Ruled a slip, he stands immediately and continues. Ali, backed against the rope again, blocks shots, pushes Frazier into the middle of the ring... \nALI SWINGS FRAZIER \naround.     But Frazier cranks his left.     ALI SEES IT COMING... ALI (to himself) Hook's comin'. Lean back, man! Move back! WORK LEGS...! \nBut Ali's legs DON'T work fast enough. Frazier's hook CRASHES into Ali's face. Ali goes rubbery as he backs to the rope. Ali comes out and backs to the rope on the other side, with cartoon rubbery legs. But the mimicry is camouflage. He really is wobbling. The crowd is going wild. We HEAR everything, now. \nFRAZIER \nis wary. He doesn't trust Ali. He walks across the ring, allowing Ali to recuperate...THE BELL. Ali walks to his corner, drained... \nHOWARD COSELL (V.O.) Ali was out! He was out on his feet. Joe almost had him. Frazier must have thought Ali was playing possum. 'Cause Ali's a clown. Others have come in on Ali when he's playing possum and gotten knocked out. \nAli saved himself with GUILE. \nROUND FIFTEEN: \nThey clinch. They separate. They both...as if mirror images of each other...crouch, looking for shots. Ali's right is down. Frazier's right is down. As they both rise up out of the crouch, Frazier's out of the box first. Ali's right is coming around. Frazier's left hook slams Ali across the jaw. Ali goes down. Half the crowd ROARS for Frazier. Ali gets right up and stands in the corner and takes the mandatory eight-count. The right side of his face is swollen like a balloon. They resume... \nOVERHEAD:    ANOTHER CLINCH \nAli takes another right, but the ropes hold him up. Another left catches Ali. Frazier's face is a grotesque, swollen mask. He doesn't care. \n", "test2_true": "is exhausted.    Labored breathing.     The crowd cheering Frazier. \nTHEN THE BELL. \nAli drops his arms. He knows he lost. Frazier raises his arms.

MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, ALI'S DRESSING ROOM - ALI - NIGHT \nANGELO DUNDEE Hell of a fight, champ... \nNot only have we seen Ali lose for the first time, not only do we see him bruised, but when a fighter's beaten, everybody who believes in him is beaten. Angelo's cutting the tape off his hands. Bundini places an ice pack on the back of his neck. \nHANGERS-ON They stole it from you! (etc.) \nBundini's wise enough to say nothing. \nALI Shut up! I lost. (louder) Get outta here... \nRudy heard... \nRUDY Go on!   Everybody out! \nAs they leave, the door reveals packed media outside.   Door closes. Now it's only the inner circle. \nANGELO DUNDEE (to Pacheco) Ferdie, take a look at this... (to Ali) It was still a hell of a fight. \nALI Where's Belinda? \nPACHECO She fainted... They took her to the aid station. She's okay. \nPacheco looks at Ali's hand. It shakes. Pacheco looks at Ali's eyes and has him follow his finger. \nALI My hands was in sand, Angie.     My feet in water... \nANGELO DUNDEE Maybe we shoulda had more time between Blin and this, you know...to get back into... \nALI Woulda, shoulda, coulda... (pause) After three-and-a-half years, this...from how far back...comeback is. \nAli throws a water bottle. It shatters and splays wet down the wall. There is mature, deep-seated, dead-serious molten anger. Everybody in the room feels it. \nINT. CORRIDOR \nWith Bundini, Bingham, Rudy and Sarria as a wedge, Ali drives through reporters on the way to Belinda. Press mob Ali... \nPRESS Were you robbed? \nALI I lost. You lose, you don't shoot yourself. The world goes on. \nANOTHER REPORTER Joe said he didn't think you wanted to fight him again... \nALI (stops) Oh, how wrong he is. \nINT. MADISON SQUARE GARDEN, AID STATION - BELINDA - NIGHT sees Ali...the beating.       She begins crying. \nBELINDA My God.    They killed you! \nAli moves to her, followed by Bingham and Pacheco.     A doctor's approaching with a sedative in a syringe. \nPACHECO Get away from her.     What is that? \nAli leans over, speaks softly. \nALI I ain't dead, baby!     C'mon. \nEmbracing her, his eyes connect with Dundee. Ali's Supreme Court victory is meaningless.

Terrify him with what you can take... \nAli's eyes are stars. He sees everything. He sees things no one else can see in the quantum physics of deflecting the force of Foreman's blows. \nFOREMAN \ndesperate, pounds a left to Ali's side, a blocked left to the head, three lefts to the belly, which get through! Ali's left arm convulses downwards, involuntarily, with the blows. What Ali's not ready for and doesn't block is the right hand that follows. This shot is jarring and concussive. He grabs Foreman's neck and has to hold on. \nThe BELL. \nEXT. RING - ALI - MID-ROUND SEVEN \nleaning way back at impossible angles -- soaking up George's shots. George is SLOWER...BUT Ali's not throwing at all! \nALI (hisses to George) Eight more rounds... You runnin' outta gas? \nThen...Ali comes out from under. \nWHAM.     WHAM.     WHAM.   WHAM.

Ali's in the corner, having avoided the shot. \nFOREMAN \ngets in a couple of lefts that Ali deflects. Ali takes another on the cheek, leans way back again. Suddenly, he seems tired, as is Foreman.

BUT... \nEXTREMELY CLOSE:   WE SEE ALI'S EYES ARE DEAD SHARP \nHe's faking. \nFOREMAN \nbacks Ali into the corner. \nALI \nhits Foreman with a left. Foreman launches a short left that Ali counters with a BIG RIGHT CROSS that connects. \nFOREMAN'S \nhead snaps around. Sweat sprays in a parabola of light. Crowd ROARS with expectation.

And the most significant moments begin... \nSLO-MO:   ALI ON THE LEFT + FOREMAN ON THE RIGHT ...and Ali's left hand is extended way behind him with the wrist bent, no power. As it passes his body, Ali converts it into a left hook. As he's doing this, he's dropping his left foot back. The left foot DOES NOT support a left hand. It's for a right hand so the body can untorque across with the punch. And Ali is already cocking his right. Meanwhile, the left connects with Foreman's jaw and raises his chin. As the left is departing Foreman's chin, Ali launches the RIGHT. \nSLO-MO:   AS ALI'S RIGHT HAND \ncomes in, Ali's torso untorques, transitioning all 217 pounds to Ali's left foot and putting that weight and power behind his right fist that crashes into George Foreman's chin...and the impact transfers to Foreman's skull...and Foreman's head snaps around.

And through the spiral, Ali has moved with him, pivoting with the falling Foreman, his right fist cocked to unload again if he has to. He never does... \nMASSIVE OVERHEAD:   FOREMAN \ndown.

Folks who look like Jim Brown, Schulberg/Mailer types...hang out, half drunk...and argue about flights out with extortionate petty bureaucrats like Zairian Official #2.

EXT. MUSIC SHOP 
Typical music shop of a small town, with plate glass windows and displays of radios, records, sheet music, etc. Activity of a couple of customers and salespeople inside. Guy comes along the street and goes into the shop. 
INT. MUSIC SHOP 
As Guy enters. There are the usual counters and shelves, pianos and radios on display, and the sound of a piano being tuned in the back of the store. MIRIAM is finishing with a customer at a counter. MR. HARGREAVES, the manager, is busy at the shelves. Another girl clerk is serving a customer. In one of the glass cubicles where records are tried out, a customer is playing symphonic music; in a second glass cubicle another customer is listening to a record of popular music. A third cubicle is empty. Activity of the street is seen through the plate glass front. 
Guy walks straight to Miriam, just as she is finishing with her woman customer, handing over a small package. 
MIRIAM (taking money from customer) Even change. Thank you, Madam. (she looks up at Guy as the woman moves off) Well -- hello, Guy. 
GUY You're looking well, Miriam. 
Miriam's face is pretty because it is still young. She is self-centered and inclined to be vindictive. She wears harlequin glasses with myopic lenses which tend to make her eyes look small. 
MIRIAM So are you. You've got a nice tan, playing tennis with all your rich friends. 
GUY (ignoring the remark) What time do we meet your lawyer? 
MIRIAM (sly little smile) What's your hurry?

GUY My hurry? That's funny, coming from you! You're the one who's in a hurry, aren't you? 
MIRIAM (coyly) When you wouldn't give me the divorce right away, I sort of hoped it was because you were a little bit jealous. 
GUY (biting) I got over being jealous, a long time ago Miriam. Miriam's eyes slide toward the other girl clerk who has moved closer, within listening range. 
MIRIAM (indicating empty glass cubicle) Let's talk in there. 
Guy follows Miriam across to the empty room.   Miriam has brought her purse along. 
They enter. 
INT. CUBICLE 
Once inside, the sounds of the music playing from other parts of the shop are heard but very faintly. The piano tuning still goes on, but less stridently. Miriam and Guy are cooped together in the close quarters. 
MIRIAM (intimately) Now this is cosier. Sort of like old times, isn't it, Guy? 
GUY (coldly) Oh, skip it, Miriam. It's pretty late to start flirting with a discarded husband. Especially when you're going to have another man's baby. 
MIRIAM Do you know, I think you're handsomer than ever?

GUY Let's see your lawyer and get this over with. 
MIRIAM Did you bring the money, Guy?   Lawyers are expensive. 
GUY (taking money from his wallet) Here it is. 
MIRIAM (taking the money greedily) If I'd known what all that tennis nonsense of yours was going to lead to, I wouldn't have run out on you. 
GUY What are you trying to say, Miriam? Come out with it. 
MIRIAM (tucking the bills away) I'm not getting a divorce. 
GUY (tense and angry) Why, you little doublecrosser. I didn't want this divorce, you did. That's what you've been harping about for the past year. 
MIRIAM It's a woman's privilege to change her mind... Now I can shop for some pretty clothes. I wouldn't want you to be ashamed of me in Washington when we go to all those dinners and swanky parties. 
GUY And what do you mean by that? 
MIRIAM (Coyly) Don't look so mad, Guy. You always smile when your picture is being taken for the papers. (MORE)

MIRIAM (CONT'D) Especially when you have Anne Burton hanging on your arm. 
GUY Let's not talk about Anne Burton. 
MIRIAM So, it's really serious between you two? Well, you can throw your dreams about her into the ashcan. Guy, I'm coming to Washington. 
GUY What for? MIRIAM To have my baby and be with you. 
GUY Why me?   It's not my baby. 
MIRIAM But people don't know that, Guy, do they? It would make a pretty story, wouldn't it -- the senator's daughter involved with a married man who's about to become a father. 
GUY (furiously) You black conniving little liar! 
A few people in the shop look around as Guy's voice rises above the sound of the record playing. 
MIRIAM Keep your voice down. 
GUY What happened? Did he run out on you? 
MIRIAM No man runs out on me.   Not even you. 
GUY You're a liar and a  cheat,   Miriam. You've wanted to get  rid of   me long enough and now I'll  go you   one better -- I never want to see  or hear   of you again.

MIRIAM (demurely) I could be very pathetic as the deserted little mother in a courtroom, Guy. Think it over. Who would believe you? 
Guy seizes her angrily and in so doing, knocks the tone arm across the record with a loud screech. From outside we can see heads turn. Mr. Hargreaves, the manager, is very disturbed. 
MED. SHOT THROUGH GLASS PARTITION FROM HARGREAVES' VIEWPOINT We see Guy gripping Miriam's arms and apparently addressing her in a threatening manner, although we do not hear his words. The smile has faded from Miriam's face and something like cringing fear has taken its place. She is drawn and tense and seems to cower beneath Guy's rage. 
Mr. Hargreaves moves forward and opens Guy's tirade.

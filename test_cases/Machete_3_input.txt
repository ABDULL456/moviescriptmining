EXT. FIRE ESCAPE - DAY 
Machete rockets down the fire escape. 
He lands and a COP smashes the back of his head with a Shotgun butt. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 23. 
Machete flies into garbage cans. 
Shotguns pump. 
He looks up. Two cops have shotguns pointed at his head. 
PATROLMAN Go ahead Jorge, I'll grease your chips all over this fucking alley! 
One of the cops cuffs him and shoves him into the backseat of a patrol car. 
PATROLMAN (CONT'D) It's going to turn into a lynch mob if we don't get him out of here now. 
The patrolmen drive away; A TV CREW spots them and jumps into their van to give chase. 
INT. PATROL CAR, MOVING 
The two patrolmen are young, hyped. 
PATROLMAN This is fucking big. This guy took a shot at a Representative. 
COP Senator. 
PATROLMAN Same fucking thing. He could die, and we caught him. 
COP Yeah, we did. They're gonna hang him like Saddam. 
PATROLMAN We're fuckin' heroes, buddy. 
The patrol car zips in and out of traffic. 
COP I'm gonna call it in. Unless you want to do it. 
PATROLMAN No. You go ahead. You're good at it. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 24. 
COP What the fuck is that supposed to mean? That I'm not good at the action stuff? Just the pussy stuff? 
PATROLMAN Did I fuckin' say that? 
COP Did you fuckin' mean it? 
PATROLMAN Look, you and me both apprehended this fuckin' suspect. We frisked him and we cuffed him and now we're bringin' him downtown. We're gonna get a medal for this. 
COP I didn't frisk him. 
PATROLMAN Yeah, you did. 
COP I'm telling you. I didn't frisk him. You must have done it. 
PATROLMAN I didn't frisk him. I thought you-- 
Suddenly, a bolus of BLOOD appears at the driver's mouth. 
COP Jesus fuck! What's wrong, man? 
In the backseat, Machete has his MACHETE in his cuffed hands, stuck through the driver's seat and into the guy's chest. Machete twists the blade and the driver turns the wheel in the direction -- MACHETE is STEERING THE CAR from the BACKSEAT with the MACHETE stuck through the DRIVER! 
PATROLMAN (SPITTING BLOOD) Oh, fuck! 
His foot goes like iron to the floor, gunning the engine. 
COP Slow down, man! 
Machete jerks the blade to one side and the COP CAR veers into oncoming traffic. RNewman / Endeavor Draft 25. 
COP (CONT'D) Holy shit!

Of course - "Wake The Dead." 
FESTER 
(delighted, to Gomez remembering this childhood favorite) "Wake The Dead"! 
GOMEZ 
(equally excited) "Wake The Dead"! Out to the cemetery! Come on, everyone! Everyone starts to exit, chattering happily. 
MARGARET 
(to Granny) I've never played this before - how does it go? 
GRANNY 
Did you bring a shovel?

PUGSLEY 
Uncle Fester, will you be on my team? 
WEDNESDAY 
No, mine! 
FESTER 
(to Wednesday) I tell you what - we'll give you a head start. Three skulls and a pelvis - how's that? Pugsley and Wednesday cheer and run out.   Fester faces Gomez. 
FESTER 
My own dear brother - who could be more precious? 
GOMEZ 
Blood is thicker than water, old man. 
MORTICIA 
(touched by the brothers devotion) And just as refreshing. Gomez offers his hand.   Fester takes it, in a manly handshake.

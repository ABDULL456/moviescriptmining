There's an awkward instant followed by too much cheerfulness. 
CAROL (chipper) Hi! 
NICK Hi, honey. 
CAROL Hi. 
BETH 
stands in the doorway, awkwardly conscious of having interrupted something. 
BETH (w/ forced cheer) Hi. 
CUT TO: 
EXT. FRONT LAWN - NIGHT 
Nick and Beth are standing in the lawn, lit by the glow of the porch lamp. 
Both sides of the street are lined with nearly identical tiny faux Spanish houses. 
BETH G'night. 
THE FRONT DOORWAY 
Carol waves. 
CAROL G'night. 
ANOTHER ANGLE INCLUDING NICK, BETH, AND CAROL 
NICK (calling out) Pizza Hut, tomorrow? 
CAROL Okay. (to Beth) I've got the short shift -- you want me to come over, help pack? 
BETH Great... I'm really sorry we didn't tell you sooner. He just decided. 
CAROL 
smiles to herself, a trace of sadness in her eyes. 
CAROL I understand. 
She shuts the door. 
NICK AND BETH 
She starts to walk across the lawn. She stops and stares at Nick, who's staring out into the night, oblivious to her. 
BETH I'm tired. I'm going to bed. 
He turns and looks at her. 
NICK What's your problem? 
BETH I haven't got a problem. 
NICK Okay. 
He walks up to her and past her -- when she doesn't fall into step, he stops. 
NICK You agreed to try Billings. 
BETH I know. (in Nick's words) Billings, Montana. City of the future. 
NICK Yeah and I read that a while ago -- so the future's probably already there. 
She smiles and shakes her head. 
NICK (defensively) It's not like you're leaving anything behind. A good job or something. 
BETH Just some friends. 
He puts his arms around her waist from behind, and nestles her against his body. 
NICK You'll make new friends. 
BETH I know. (after a beat) I'm not eight years old. I know I'll make new friends.

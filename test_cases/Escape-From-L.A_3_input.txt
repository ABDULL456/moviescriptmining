INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM 
They watch the sub, a red blip on the screen, move along the freeway. 
INT. SUBMARINE 
Plissken twists his hand throttle, pouring on the power to 90%. 
EXT. VENTURA & HOLLYWOOD FREEWAY INTERCHANGE - UNDERWATER - NIGHT 
The sub rips through the water, faster and faster, goes into a hard bank to the right as the Ventura Freeway turns into the Hollywood. A sign at the edge of the Hollywood Freeway reads: "SPEED LIMIT 55". The sub screams past. 
INT. COMMAND HQ - MAIN CONTROL ROOM 
Brazen points to a readout showing the submarine's engine status. 
BRAZEN His reactor's starting to overheat. 
MALLOY Plissken, slow down the sub. You're overloading the power plant. 
INT. SUBMARINE 
Plissken glances at the gauge. His nuclear turbine readout: green, moving to yellow, into red. He pushes it up to 102%. 
MALLOY (V.O.) Plissken...? 
Plissken's eye turns back to the computer map in front of him. One the screen: the red blip representing the sub is headed right toward a building. Plissken pulls hard on the controls. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - UNIVERSAL CITY - THE BLACK TOWER - NIGHT 
The sub smacks into the side of the Black Tower, powers through it, blasts out the other side through a window, tilting and wobbling. The sub rights itself momentarily but is slammed downward out of frame by a huge, dark, slimy object. 
KING KONG looms overhead - his fist rising and falling with the currents. Plissken has maneuvered himself into the wreckage of the Universal Studios Tour. 
The sub zips through the King Kong ride into Back To The Future, passing 1950's signage from that film, dodging a rusting Delorean. It slams into the open mouth of JAWS, shattering the model into a million pieces. 
The sub continues on, bouncing through the narrow openings of the Earthquake Ride - broken pipes, cracked sidewalks, split walls - hard to tell what was the ride and what was The Big One. 
INT. SUBMARINE 
Plissken hangs on, as small jets of water spray into the cockpit through tiny cracks in the hull. 
EXT. UNDERWATER - MOVING WITH THE SUBMARINE - NIGHT 
The sub suddenly tips upward, rising for the surface. 
EXT. SHORELINE - CAHUENGA PASS - NIGHT 
The sub explodes out of the water, lands belly first on a hillside with a hard thump. 
INT. SUBMARINE 
Plissken presses the hatch controls. The sub begins to slide backwards down toward the water. 
INT. SUBMARINE 
Plissken struggles, then rips open the hatch, scrambles out. The sub slowly slips backwards, down into the water. As the rear exhaust tubes hit the surface, a blast of steam. Plissken leaps out of the hatch. The sub sinks faster and faster. He scampers up the side, leaps for ground... and lands on the hillside, as the sub sinks into the sea, bubbling, churning, hissing. 
A bleeping sound. He takes out his pocket walkie, raises the antenna. 
MALLOY (V.O.) Plissken...? 
PLISSKEN I'm here. 
MALLOY (V.O.) Where's the submarine? It's disappeared off our screens. 
PLISSKEN It's history. I gotta go. 
Plissken clicks off the walkie, pockets it, turns to climb up the hillside when... 
WHAM! Standing above him is a dark figure. Hooded. Carrying something huge and rounded at the ends. 
Plissken raises his submachine gun... 
... as PIPELINE steps closer. He's a surfer in a black wetsuit. Carries a surfboard. A rifle is slung across his shoulder. Pipeline's face is raw, burned - too many hours surfing in the UV. 
PIPELINE Too bad about your boat, man. (Plissken doesn't move) Supposed to be some swells out here tonight. Big ones. (beat) You like to surf?

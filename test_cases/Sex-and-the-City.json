I'll just bury it deep in the back -- like I did my feelings. \nCarries closes the box back up. Louise watches; then. \nLOUISE Do you miss him? \nCARRIE (beat; then) Every day. You know, it's weird -- I haven't cried very much at all. Maybe you're only allotted a certain amount of tears per man -- and I used mine up. \nCarrie gently pushes the box away. Opens another. \nLOUISE Yeah. I know how you feel `cause, my college boyfriend broke up with me last year. And I miss him all the time. \nCARRIE (V.O.) Suddenly, it dawned on me -- there were two broken hearts in my-walk in. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) Louise -- we need a cocktail. Grab your rental. \nCarrie starts out.

But -- you know -- whatever. I'm not going to give up on love. \nCARRIE Good. \nLOUISE Love is the thing, you know. \nShe holds up her key chain. The word \"Love\" in gold. \nLOUISE (CONT'D) See that. I'm bringing it to me all day long. \nLouise gets a \"text\".  She reaches over and looks.     She smiles as she reads it. Carrie raises her eyebrow. \nCARRIE Oh, I remember that smile.   Who's the guy? \nLOUISE Someone I just met. He wants me to meet him for a drink. \nCARRIE At 11:30?     That's a bootie call. \nLOUISE No, it's not like that... he just got off work -- he's a waiter. \nCARRIE Louise, I may not get texts and I may not send texts -- but trust me: The sub-text of that text: Bootie. \n", "test2_true": "Louise nods, then starts texting him. \nLOUISE But it's not a bootie call if he meets me.... right? \nCARRIE All right, then.

Welcome to the house of hormones. \n157   INT. UPSCALE FURNITURE STORE -- DAY -- FALL               157 \nCarrie and Charlotte walk looking at furniture. \nCARRIE It's all about the desk.

Carrie links arms with her. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) Hey, Harry called me and mentioned you're not running. \nCHARLOTTE Why'd he do that? \nCARRIE `Cause he loves you... and he's concerned. \nCHARLOTTE There is nothing to be concerned about. \nCARRIE Did the doctor say it wasn't safe or something? \nCHARLOTTE No, she said because I'm already a runner -- it's fine. \nCARRIE So, why are you not -- \nCHARLOTTE I'm afraid something bad will happen. It's a miracle that I'm even pregnant. \nCARRIE But if the doctor said -- \nCHARLOTTE It's not rational, Carrie... it's irrational. I know that. \nCARRIE Okay. \nCHARLOTTE I've got everything I ever wanted. I'm so happy -- I'm terrified. (beat) No one gets everything they want. Look at you. Look at Miranda. You're such good people and look what happened to you. Of course, something bad is going to happen to me. \nCARRIE Sweetie, you shit your pants this year. Maybe you're done. \nCharlotte laughs a little. Carrie moves her along. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) You run   every day -- that's what you do.   You can't stop being who you are   -- just because you're afraid.   Right? \nCharlotte nods, they walk on, linked together. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) Now let's get down to business.

If I had known we were going to exchange gifts -- \nCarrie gets up and RUNS to her closet. \nCARRIE (O.C.) (CONT'D) I would have bought you one two weeks ago and hidden it in here. \nShe comes back out with a large circular BOX tied with satin ribbons. It says: Louis Vuitton. \nLOUISE No! That is not what I think it is. \nCARRIE Open it. \nLOUISE Oh my Lord. Oh my -- \nShe opens it and SCREAMS as she pulls out a gorgeous purse. \nCARRIE No more rent girl for you. \nLouise throws it over her shoulder and walks \"runway.\" \n", "test2_id": 622, "test3_input": "MIRANDA I believe that was his last campaign slogan. \nThe girls walk on. \n178   INT.

I've always liked Steve -- He's apologized a hundred times -- he's not seeing anyone else.

That's right. \nMIRANDA But he'll own it. So. You are keeping your own place, right? \nCARRIE Oh, Miranda, please, I haven't figured out all the details yet, but I'm a smart girl and I'm sure I'll figure out something I'm comfortable with. \nMIRANDA I just want to make sure you're being smart here -- \nCARRIE And I love you for it -- but for now can't you stop worrying for me and just go ahead and feel what I want you to feel. Jealous. \nMiranda smiles. Carrie puts her arm around her. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) Jealous of me living in this gorgeous penthouse in Manhattan. \nMIRANDA Fine. I'm jealous. You're in real estate heaven and I'm in Brooklyn. \nCHARLOTTE New York magazine said Brooklyn is the new Manhattan. \nMIRANDA Whoever wrote that - lives in Brooklyn. \nCARRIE There she is. Hey Hollywood! \nSamantha is standing out in front of Christies. She waves to them -- as she finishes a call. \nSAMANTHA (on phone) Samantha Jones...

The People magazine person is on hold. Smith's on the short list to be their \"Sexiest Man Alive.\" We can catch up when I'm in town next week. \nSamantha hangs up.

Now, I've got to take you out of that file. \nCARRIE Sorry about the extra paper work. \nSAMANTHA You'll get my bill. \nCARRIE Samantha, it feels so different this time. No clich\u00e9 romantic kneeling down on one knee. Just you know, two grown-ups -- making a decision about spending their lives together. \nSAMANTHA Well, I'm happy for you. \nCARRIE And one more thing... I want you to be maid of honor.

I'm forty- two and I still don't know what it means. \nCHARLOTTE I know, but she's repeating everything. \nMIRANDA Fine. How often do you guys... \nCARRIE ... \"Color\"? \nCHARLOTTE Thank-you. \nSAMANTHA Well, I can't color enough. I would color all day -- every day if I had my way. I'd use every crayon in my box. \nCARRIE We get it. You love to color. (To Miranda) Why are you asking? \nMIRANDA Steve and I were \"coloring\" last night and just as I was about to -- \nMiranda is searching for a word she can use. \nSAMANTHA Come?

I'm telling you, at the end of the day all I want to do is sleep. The most exciting thing in bed now -- is the bed. \nCARRIE So...

I'll just bury it deep in the back -- like I did my feelings. \nCarries closes the box back up. Louise watches; then. \nLOUISE Do you miss him? \nCARRIE (beat; then) Every day. You know, it's weird -- I haven't cried very much at all. Maybe you're only allotted a certain amount of tears per man -- and I used mine up. \nCarrie gently pushes the box away. Opens another. \nLOUISE Yeah. I know how you feel `cause, my college boyfriend broke up with me last year. And I miss him all the time. \nCARRIE (V.O.)

That's a bootie call. \nLOUISE No, it's not like that... he just got off work -- he's a waiter. \nCARRIE Louise, I may not get texts and I may not send texts -- but trust me: The sub-text of that text: Bootie. \nLOUISE Look who's home from the big city! \nCARRIE (V.O.)

I've always liked Steve -- He's apologized a hundred times -- he's not seeing anyone else. What's it going to take? \nMIRANDA And are you also suggesting that she forgive Big? \nCHARLOTTE No. I could kill Big. Sometimes when I'm running -- I imagine what I'd say if I ever saw him again. I have the perfect opening sentence. Want to hear it? \nCARRIE (duh?) Ah.... yes. \nCHARLOTTE I curse the day you were born. \nCARRIE Impressive.

I know how much you were looking forward to this. \nCARRIE Yeah, I really was... until I became the poster child for wounded women everywhere. \nCHARLOTTE You're not. \nCARRIE Is this thing going to effect everything I do for the rest of my life? \nCHARLOTTE No -- but if you leave right now -- it will effect the rest of your day. \nCarrie looks at her -- takes this in. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) (softly) It's Fashion Week. We're in the front row. \nCARRIE Where everyone can see me. \nCHARLOTTE Who cares about them -- You only came for the clothes. \nCarrie smiles... a little. \nCHARLOTTE (CONT'D) I know it's hard but -- It's like you said: You can't stop being who you are. \n178B   INT.

She pushes them away. \nCARRIE And I think what hurts the most is that you kept a secret from me. I have never ever kept a secret from you. Ever! \nShe starts out. Stops, comes back -- through the ribbons. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) No, I'm lying. For the last five months I've been thinking that it's a huge mistake that you left Steve. (beat) There. How does it feel? \nShe turns and pushes balloons out of her way as she starts out. A KISSING COUPLE (20's) is BLOCKING her way. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) Excuse me! \nThey stop -- She squeezes by them.

Ever. \nHARRY Then, why would he say that he had? \nCarrie looks at Harry. Lost. Confused. \n228   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER -- SPRING                  228 \nCarrie enters her apartment. She glances over at her bookcase -- Remembers. \nJUMP CUT TO: Carrie opens the bookcase drawer and takes out a Manila envelope marked: P.O. Box. \nJUMP CUT TO: Carrie dumps the contents of the envelopes on the desk. \nJUMP CUT TO: Carrie quickly sorts through the mail -- looking -- looking for something. A letter -- something. Nothing from him. She leans back in her chair -- more confused. Her eyes drift up to her computer. She wonders if -- \nJUMP CUT TO: Carrie is logging onto CarrieBradshaw.com. She types in PASSWORD. \nJUMP CUT TO: CarrieBradshaw.com's \"welcome page.\" She clicks on EMAIL. \nJUMP CUT TO: Carrie scans through emails -- none are from Big. Frustrated she logs off. \n229   INT. CARRIE'S APARTMENT -- LATER                            229 \nCarrie is still at her desk, lost in thought. \nCARRIE (VO) Two hours, two manila envelopes and countless emails later, I was just about to give up on the Big riddle when -- \nShe looks back at her computer screen and notices: \n\"CB-assistant.\" Carrie sits up. Clicks on it. \nCARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) I had told Louise to put Big in a place where I would never have to hear from him again. \nShe types in her password. Nothing. Picks up her phone. Dials a number. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) Hey, Louise -- it's me. What's the password to get into your assistant file? Call me. \nShe hangs up and places the phone on a pile of mail -- which causes the mail to fall over onto the floor. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) Shit. \nCarrie reaches down to pick-up the mail -- she notices the \"LOVE\" key chain has fallen as well. She picks it up and looks at it, has a hunch. \nCARRIE (CONT'D) Oh my God. \nJUMP CUT TO: Carrie types the password: \"L-O-V-E.\" Yes! The file opens -- her eyes widen. There on the screen are many, many, many emails -- all from JJP@JJP.com. \nCARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) As soon as I typed in \"love\" -- there he was. \nShe clicks on the first e-mail. It opens: \nIt's the love letter from Beethoven, retyped. \nCARRIE (V.O.) (CONT'D) And because Big still didn't have the words... he retyped a love letter from Beethoven. \n"}

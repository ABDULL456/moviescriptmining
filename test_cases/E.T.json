{"test1_input": "[Laughter is generated because while E.T.'s behavior would be appropriate if Mike was really wounded, it is inappropriate in this situation since the knife is fake.] \nMary comes back with a camera and prepares to photograph them. \n\"You look great,\" says Mary. \"Thank you,\" says Mike. \"Thank you,\" says Elliott. \"Thank you,\" says E.T. Mary doesn't notice that E.T. has spoken. \n[Laughter is generated by the \"rule of three\" humor structure and Mary's ignorance.] \nWhen Mary takes the photo, the flash shocks E.T. and knocks him onto the floor. Mike and Elliott quickly pull him up before Mary notices and lead him out of the house. \n[They succeed in their objective with the help of their \"not so smart\" mother.] \nEXT: STREET: DAY \nMary walks down the driveway as she orders them to be home no later than one-hour after sundown. E.T., dressed in the sheet, turns and looks at Mary, then continues down the driveway with Mike and Elliott. \n[This creates a \"timelock\", a sense of urgency, and the expectation of an upset mother if they haven't returned by the assigned time.] \nEXT: COMMUNITY: DAY \nEstablishing shot of the neighborhood. On a hilltop by a fence stands another person in a white sheet (presumably Gertie). She kicks dirt at the bicycle near the fence. \n[This is the end objective of Mike, Elliot and E.T.: to connect up with Gertie at the lookout. Their obstacle is to get E.T past all the children on the streets.] \nEXT: STREET: DAY \nThe sun is setting. Children in Halloween costumes walk through the streets. E.T. walks between Mike and Elliott, as he watches the other children parade by. One child dressed as YODA from RETURN OF THE JEDI walks by. E.T. turns and walks after him saying \"HOME,HOME.\" \n[The laughter is obviously the result of E.T. misinterpreting the situation by believing that the child is another alien.] \nThey walk towards the setting sun as Mike reminds Elliott that he must be back by one hour after sunset. Elliott promises to try, but he wants Mike to cover for him. \n[This creates jeopardy for the characters, because if they don't complete their mission within the time frame, they will have trouble with Mary.] \n", "test1_true": "The sun is setting as Mike, Elliott, and two small characters covered with sheets stand on the hilltop overlooking the city. Elliott asks Mike to help him lift E.T. onto the bike. Mike does and then tells Elliott that they will be waiting for him. \n[They have reached this objective. The next objective for Elliott and E.T is to get to the landing site in the forest.] \nEXT: FOREST: DAY \nElliott, with E.T sitting in the front basket, rides his bicycle through the forest. The road becomes very bumpy. Elliott tells E.T. that they will have to walk from there. Suddenly, E.T. takes control of the bike through the use of his telekinetic powers and speeds it forward. Eliott becomes frightened as E.T. speeds the bike towards a cliff and then drives it over the edge. E.T. then makes the bike up through the air. \n[The audience gulps from suspense and then goes into elation by this surprising and magical turn of events.] \nThey continue to fly over the tree tops. Elliott yells \"Not so high, not so high.\" \n[E.T and Elliott both have white hoods over their heads, which further visually reinforces their identification.] \nThey ride across the front of the moon, the guiding light of magic. Elliott laughs with glee. When they start their descent he begs E.T. not to crash. They hit the ground. The bike turns over, and both E.T. and Elliott are thrown to the ground. \nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT \nThe grandfather clock indicates 9:45. Mary watches the clock as she sits in front of lighted candles. The time has long passed when Elliott was supposed to be home. The lighted candles give a church like effect as if Mary was praying for the safety of her children. She is upset that they haven't returned. She blows out the candles, then taps out another candle with her wand. \n[There is jeopardy for the children as Mary and the audience wonder if they are okay. Empathy is generated for Mary who is truly concerned for the safety of her children.] \nEXT: FOREST: NIGHT \nThe sun has set. It's nighttime in the forest. E.T opens a box which contains the saw blade brought to him by Elliott. Elliott ties a rope up to a tree branch. He then opens the umbrella which is lined with aluminum foil and points it towards the star-filled sky. It will function as a transmitter. E.T. places a coat hanger with nails above the saw blade, plugs a cable into a battery, then activates the toy language teaching device. \n[They succeeded in completing their objective to reach the landing site. Their new objective is to communicate with E.T.'s fellow aliens in order to accomplish E.T.'s primary objective, which is to return home.] \nINT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: NIGHT \nMary, still dressed in her leopard outfit, leaves the house. She is very upset that her children have not yet returned home. She mumbles to herself, sticks the wand in her mouth, and shakes the car keys. She gets into the car and mumbles that their father is going to hear about this one. \"Mexico!\" she says. She drives down the driveway and into the street to search for her children. \n[This creates more empathy for Mary, who is very upset that her small children are out this late. The parents in the audience can easily identify with her. But the real function of this scene is to get her out of the house so that the antagonist can invade their home. She could have stayed inside, we never see her in the car searching for the children, and the next time we do see her is by the refrigerator in the kitchen.] \n", "test1_id": 2538, "test2_input": "Michael enters the closet space where E.T. stayed. He looks at the objects, including the cartoon page from the newspaper, then huddles down among E.T.'s possessions. \n[These actions create more empathy for Michael who suffers at the thought of losing E.T.] \nThe is a time transition, for Michael is asleep in E.T.'s space when the morning sun shines on his face. Michael wakes up, then watches the plant (which represents E.T.'s life force) wilt. He screams. \nINT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY \n\"E.T., don't go\" screams Elliott. \nDoctors state that he has no blood pressure and there is no pulse or respiration. A bell rings, which signifies a life and death situation. Doctors run into the room and tear down the plastic coverings surrounding E.T. \n\"Leave him alone. You're killing him,\" says Elliott. They wheel Elliott out of the room as he continues to scream. The medical staff frantically tries to revive E.T. They try electrical shocks, but that fails. Gertie holds her doll as she watches. She reacts by jumping when the electrical shocks are applied to E.T. \n[Showing one character's reactions to a situation help to create the intended reaction in the audience.] \nThe doctors are losing him. Elliott watches and cries. Mary goes to him and they hug each other. Gertie cries as she holds her doll. Mike walks into the room, as \"Keys\" watches, then turns away. \n[This provides the audience with each character's reaction to the death of E.T. This is a surprising event for the audience: the protagonist has died. Emotionally, it was designed to sadden the audience so that they will become overjoyed when he is brought back to life.] \nEXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY \nA white van awaits at the bottom of the driveway. \n[Previously, the vans and cars associated with the antagonist were of dark colors. The color changes allows the filmmaker to use culturally determined color associations to manipulate the audience's emotional responses.] \nPolice and other officials walk past a white van, white truck, police cars and other white vehicles towards a tan colored car. Mike's friends sit on their bikes behind police barriers. They make comments that something has just happened inside the house. \n[This establishes the existence of Mike's friends who will play a crucial role in the last chase scene.] \nINT: MEDICAL ROOM: DAY \nThe medical staff gives up on E.T. and decide to pack him in ice. Mike watches as the staff of E.T. slowly walks away. \"Keys\" removes his headgear and walks to Elliott who is standing vigil over E.T.'s body. \"Keys\" then approaches E.T. Mike watches and cries as a man behind him removes his headgear. The faces of several medical attendants are shown. \n", "test2_true": "\"Keys\" kneels besides E.T. and with gloved hand closes his eyes. Mary holds Gertie. When Gerite asks if he's dead, Mary replies that she thinks so. Gertie then says she wishes him back. \n[The interchange between Gertie and Mary reminds the audience of the Tinker Bell situation when Mary read to her from Peter Pan. Those same feelings are reintroduced here: the clapping of hands to save the fairy and then the desire to rescue the children. This is the payoff to the emotional reactions set up in that earlier scene.] \n\"Keys\" looks up to see two attendants roll in a metal casing filled with ice into which they will place E.T.'s body. \nMary picks up Gertie and carries her out of the room. Medical technicians prepare the casing as Elliott watches. Keys approaches Elliot and tells him that they will be taking E.T. away. \"They are just going to cut him all up,\" replies Elliott. \n[This is the payoff to the frog sequence. The audience believes that Elliott is correct, given the scientific mind as demonstrated by the teacher. They also now remember the joy they felt when Elliott freed the frogs, and wish they could experience that again now.] \n\"Do you want to spend some time alone with him?\" asks \"Keys,\" as he puts his arm around Elliott and walks him to the casing. He tells the medical attendants to leave the room. \n[This generates empathy for \"Keys\" who is shown to be concerned for Elliott's feelings.] \nThe attendants walk out of the room past Michael who is watching Elliott. \"Keys\" leaves Elliott alone with the body of E.T., which is covered in a plastic bag as it lies on dry ice. Elliott stares down at E.T. \n\"Look at what they've done to you. I'm so sorry. You must be dead. I... I didn't know how to feel. I can't feel anything anymore. You've gone someplace else now. E.T., I love you.\" \n[Elliott wears a partially open white-jacket. He is framed within an oval shaped glass.] \nElliott places the cover down over E.T. and walks away from the oval glass. A red-light flashes from inside the casing, but Elliott doesn't notice this as he walks away. He passes the pot of wilted flowers. The flowers slowly start to regain strength. Elliott notices this, then quickly returns the casing. \n[This is the payoff for the pot-of-wilted-flowers prop.] \nHe opens the casing, sees the red-light flashing from E.T.'s heart, then zips open the plastic bag. The alien looks up and says \"E.T. phone home.\" Elliott screams with joy. \"Home, home, home, home,\" says E.T. \"Does this mean they are coming?\" asks Elliott. \"Yes,\" answers E.T. \n[E.T. has finally succeeded in his objective of communicating home.] \nElliott tells him to stay and shut up, as he places his hand over E.T.'s mouth. Elliott zips him back up, then places a cloth over his flashing red-heart, as \"KEYS\" re-enters the room. Elliott slams down the cover. \"KEYS\" pulls Elliott away from the case as two attendants prepare for its removal. Elliott cries out with feigned sorrow to conceal his glee when he sees the wilted flowers regain their health. The attendants lock the case. \nINT: DECONTAMINATION CHAMBER: DAY \nElliott tells Mike that E.T. is alive. Mike's also overjoyed. Mike and Elliott rejoice as the wilted flowers continue to bloom. \n", "test2_id": 2539, "test3_input": "INT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY \nMary is talking to \"KEYS\" as Gertie runs up with the pot of flowers in her hands. He asks Mary if the boys have gone because she's sup- posed to give her a note when they have gone. Mary takes the note from Gertie and reads it. \n[This note provides the crisis to which Mary must react, yet the audience is kept in suspense.] \nEXT: PLASTIC TUNNEL: DAY \nElliott runs down the tunnel past two men dressed in blue, then enters the back of the van. Elliott then pulls aside the white curtains that separate the drivers compartment from the back of the van to reveal Michael in the driver's seat. He to is wearing a blue jacket. Elliott yells at Mike for not wearing his mask. Suddenly, a black official walks by the van, spots Mike in the driver's seat, and knocks on the window. He holds a walkie-talkie in his hand as he asks Mike who he is. Mike responds that he's driving. The official tells Mike to open the door. When Mike looks to Elliott for advice, Elliott tells him to drive away. \n[Elliott and Mike's objective is to escape with E.T.] \nA group of men approach the van. Mike screams that he's never driven forward before, shifts into first gear, and drives away. \n[This is the payoff to the scene of Mike incompetently backing the car down the driveway.] \nAs Mike drives away he drags along the plastic tunnel with the two men still inside. Mike briefly stops by his friends and tells them to meet him at the playground at the top of he hill. He then drives away, pursued by a group of men. Mike's friends put on their hats and sun- glasses, and join the fray. \n[The chase is on. Suspense is created because the audience wonders whether they will get E.T. back to the forest before the are stopped. They face impossible odds, yet Mike's friends display loyalty as they join the fight. Mike and Elliott's first objective is to reach the park. Their major obstacle is the men trying to capture them.] \nMike drives the van down the street. The two men still in the plastic tunnel try to climb back towards the van. Elliott starts to disconnect the tunnel by pulling out metal braces. \n[Jeopardy: If these men get into the van, they will overpower Elliott and Mike, and prevent E.T. from getting home.] \nEXT: ELLIOTT'S HOUSE: DAY \nMary backs her car out of the garage. Gertie is sitting next to her in the front seat holding onto the flower pot. \"Keys\" runs up to Mary and asks where she's going. Gertie blunts out \"to the spaceship.\" \n[\"Keys\" now realizes that the aliens are returning for E.T. This is his \"crisis\" information, that spurns him into action.] \nEXT: STREET: DAY \nThe van continues down the road, still pulling the plastic tunnel behind it. The two men have almost made it to the back of the van as Elliott pulls out the final stake. He tosses it to one of the men. When Mike turns a sharp corner the plastic tunnel disconnects, leaving the two men behind. \n", "test3_true": "EXT: STREET: DAY \nA convoy of police cars drive up a street. \n[The chase is still on. Even though one obstacle has been overcome, the antagonist brings more formidable forces into the fight. The protagonist is still in jeopardy.] \nEXT: PARK: DAY \nThe white van drives up over the sidewalk and into the park. It swerves between the children's rides, then finally stops. Smoke pours out of the van, whose back two doors are still open. \n[They have reached their sub-objective: the park where they are to meet up with Mike's friends and continue on their bikes.] \nMike's friends wait on their bikes. Between them they also have bikes for Elliott and Mike. E.T. is revealed to the boys. He stands among the smoke from the dry-ice with his red-heart light flashing. \"Okay, he's a man from outer space and we're taking him to his spaceship,\" says Elliott, now dressed in blue pants, white shirt, and red jacket. \"Why can't he just beam up?\" asks Greg. \"This is reality, Greg,\" says Elliott. \n[Of course, the joke is that it isn't reality. It is a fantasy movie with a realistic response to a fantastic situation. Right?] \n[Elliott finally wins the respect and admiration of Mike's friends, something he's desired from his introduction scene when they wouldn't allow him to play DUNGEONS & DRAGONS with them.] \nEXT: PARK: DAY \nMary, along with a crowd of plain clothes police, run towards the van. \"Don't shoot, they're only children,\" screams Mary. \n[This introduces a life and death jeopardy into the scene. It also characterizes the forces of the antagonist as characters who would shoot children.] \nThey reach the back of the van only to find it empty. \nEXT: STREET: DAY \nElliott and friends ride down the street. E.T., covered with a white blanket, rides in Elliott's basket. Elliott, with the red hood over his head, shouts that they are to ride to the forest. \n[To cloth a character in red is effective in chase scenes. This helps the audience to visually pick out the scenes important character when the pace is fast and the action intense. Spielberg used this technique for Elliot in this scene and for Marion in RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK when she runs through the market chased by Arabs.] \nCars chase them. Elliott rides up the alley and tells the others to follow him. Police cars encircle them and try to cut them off. The bikers turn off the main road and ride into a dirt field. A tan car with \"UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT\" written on the driver's door rides parallel to the bikers. \n", "test3_id": 2540}

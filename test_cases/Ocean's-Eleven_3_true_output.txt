DANNY (smiles, rises) Good seeing you, Tess. 
TESS Take care, Danny. 
Danny goes.    When he's out the door... 
TESS I'm sorry -- 
BENEDICT (like lightning) Don't be. 
110   OUTSIDE RESTAURANT                                             110 
MOVING WITH Danny as he exits, his fingers snapping, he saw the mist in Tess's eyes just now, he knows he's got a fighting chance with her, but what he does not know is... 
... Linus is tailing him, ten steps back. He stops, glances back at the restaurant quizzically, then continues following Danny. 
111   INT. BASHER TARR'S HOTEL ROOM - DAY                            111 
Nobody lights a match, this place is a powder keg. Basher sits on his bed, surrounded by combustibles, whittling and polishing a plastic explosive into an emerald shape. There's a KNOCK at the door... 
MAID (O.S.) House cleaning. 
BASHER (eyes never leave his work) Just jumping into the shower, can you come back later? 
The maid moves on, on TV:     A Reporter broadcasts live... 
REPORTER (V.O.) We're here at the historic Paradiso Hotel and Casino, once the prize resort of Las Vegas, now seconds away from demolition... 
OCEAN'S 11 - Rev. 10/24/00                            76. 
112   EXT. PARADISO HOTEL (ON STRIP) - DAY                        112 
Just down the block from the Terry Benedict Trinity stands (for a few remaining moments) the edifice of the Paradiso, Reuben Tishkoff's bankrupted hotel-casino. 
A crowd has gathered to witness its destruction: Terry Benedict, for one, his finger on the button and his face in the spotlight; Tess another, standing (near)by her man; Danny, too, hidden within the masses, eyes fixed on his ex; and Linus, who keeps a steady bead on Danny. 
REPORTER ... and here's Reuben Tishkoff, former owner of the Paradiso, come to bid farewell to his fabled resort and wish Terry Benedict all the best with his future plans for the property... 
Terry greets Reuben before the TV cameras and newspaper reporters, and everyone's smiling and shaking hands, but behind those smiles and under their breaths... 
BENEDICT Good to see you. 
REUBEN Go shit in your mouth. 
Tess, her eyes roaming the crowd, finds a pair staring back at her: Danny's. She holds his glance a moment -- long enough for both Linus and Benedict to notice -- before turning away, to... 
... Benedict, who puts his public smile back on and steps up to a podium alongside MIKE TYSON and LENNOX LEWIS, and together they all put their hands on "the plunger" and Benedict leans into a microphone... 
BENEDICT I hope there's as much dynamite in the Paradiso as there will be in this Saturday's fight. 
... and -- WHOOMPH -- the PLUNGER comes down and -- write your own onomatopoeia here -- the PARADISO IMPLODES. Reuben wipes a tear from his eye. 
REUBEN G'bye, honey... 
113   INT. BASHER TARR'S HOTEL ROOM - SAME TIME                   113 
As the Paradiso crumbles outside his window, the lights and TV in his room flicker and go out. (CONTINUED) 
113   CONTINUED:                                                       113 
BASHER Shit. 
As he scrambles out the door, making sure to post a "Do Not Disturb" sign... 
RUSTY (V.O.) Saturday day is yours. Do whatever you like with it. 
114   INT. TISHKOFF'S - GAME ROOM - NIGHT                              114 
FROM ABOVE, SLOWLY DESCENDING: Ten of our eleven (Basher is missing) surround the model of the three casinos. Rusty leads everyone in a run-down of the heist... 
RUSTY Call is at five-thirty. Makeup and costume. Saul's package arrives at seven-fifteen, and Linus grabs our codes. All goes well there and we're a go. Seven- thirty Virgil and Turk deliver Yen and we're committed. From that point, we have thirty minutes to blow the power or he suffocates. 
We DESCEND ONTO the miniature of the vault, then -- 
DISSOLVE TO: 
115   INT. BELLAGIO VAULT - NIGHT                                      115 
FROM ABOVE, DESCENDING STILL: This is the Real Deal. The Bellagio vault. A clock reads: 8:03. 
RUSTY (V.O.) Once the electricity goes, all entry points to the vault and its elevator will automatically lock down for two minutes. That's when we make our move... 
Two guards wheel in a cash cart and leave it in the vault's center and march out again, closing the thick metal door behind them. When the vault LOCKS CLICK... 
... We STOP DESCENDING, just above the cash cart. There is silence for a spell, the lights flicker out, then... 
... the false top of the cart springs open, revealing Yen within, folded neatly. 
(CONTINUED)

115   CONTINUED:                                                     115 
He inhales deeply, then slowly unspools himself from the cash cart until, at last, he crouches atop it. He takes in the room: vacant and silent. 
Except for Rusty, who walks right by him, incongruously. 
RUSTY Okay: they've put you in the middle of the room, far from everything. You have to get from here to the door without touching the floor. What do you do? 
A WIDER ANGLE reveals we're... 
116   INT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         116 
The Bellagio vault has been fully reproduced here, and what we've been watching has been a trial run. Ten of the eleven (Turk and Virgil in guard costumes, Basher is still missing) watch from offstage, like a film crew watching a dress rehearsal. 
FRANK Fin says he shorts it. 
LIVINGSTON Make it a sawbuck. 
From a dead squat, Yen leaps, hands first, from the cash cart to a ledge five yards away, and grips it safely with both hands without touching the floor. From this position, he'll inch his way to a counter, then, to the door... 
Frank pays up. Behind him, a DOOR SLAMS, and he turns to see Basher, at last. Sniffing the air, he double-takes -- Basher's covered head-to-toe in sewage. 
BASHER (and he's not happy) We're in deep shit. 
117   EXT. WAREHOUSE - NIGHT                                         117 
Linus hoses Basher off, his accent angry and thick as he spits out water and the story of his afternoon and if nobody understands a word he's saying, that's okay...

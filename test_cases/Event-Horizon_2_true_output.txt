Something SPARKS and SIZZLES in the dim light, catching Miller's eye. He looks up... 
One of the EXPLOSIVE CHARGES has been removed from the its mounting in the Corridor. 
MILLER Smith, get out of there... 
SMITH (O.S.) (intercom) Come again, Skipper? 
MILLER One of the explosives is missing from the corridor. I think Weir may have put it on the Clark. 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - AIRLOCK 
Smith's eyes open wide. 
MILLER (O.S.) (intercom) Get off the Clark now and wait for me at the airlock. 
SMITH No, no, we just got her back together... 
MILLER (O.S.) (intercom) Get out of there now! 
But Smith has already left the airlock... 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS 
...entering the Quarters, tearing through storage lockers. 
SMITH Where is it, where is it... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MAIN ACCESS CORRIDOR - WITH AIRLOCKS 
MILLER Smith? Smith! Fuck! 
Miller races down the corridor towards the airlock, towards his ship... 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - QUARTERS 
A BEEPING sound catches Smith's attention. He follows the sound to a storage compartment. Rifles through it. 
SMITH I gotcha... I gotcha... 
The BEEPS are coming closer and closer together. 
Smith grabs a duffel. 
SMITH I gotcha. 
Opens it. He sees the EXPLOSIVE CHARGE from the Event Horizon even as the BEEPS become a steady TONE. He closes his eyes and SIGHS... 
INT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLOSION 
WHITE LIGHT. A MASSIVE EXPLOSION... 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED UMBILICUS) 
Miller enters the docking bay even as a HUGE BLAST knocks him back. 
MILLER NOOO! 
Safety doors close, sealing off the airlock and preventing loss of pressure. 
EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - MODEL 
The SILENT EXPLOSION tears the Lewis and Clark into two pieces, spiralling away from each other and from the Event Horizon. Metal shards, like confetti, fill the space between them. 
EXT. LEWIS AND CLARK - EXPLODED HULL SECTION 
Cooper clings to the forward section, watching the Event Horizon recede as he tumbles into space. His FRENZIED BREATHING is the only sound. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED UMBILICUS) 
Miller gets to his feet. Stares out the window upon the wreckage of his ship, spiralling away. He hits the intercom with his forearm. 
MILLER DJ. The Clark's gone. Smith and Cooper are dead. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE 
DJ What happened? 
MILLER (O.S.) (intercom) Weir. He used one of the explosives from the Corridor. 
The door opens behind DJ. The lights go out. DJ turns... 
Face to face with Weir... 
Blood crusts Weir's cheekbones, his mouth. He has no eyes. Only clotted, empty sockets. 
DJ opens his mouth to SCREAM. Weir grabs DJ by the throat, cutting him off. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - AIRLOCK BAY NO. 1 - (TATTERED UMBILICUS) 
MILLER DJ, you read me? 
DJ does not answer. The CRASH of glass and steel resonates over the intercom. 
INT. EVENT HORIZON - MEDICAL/SCIENCE 
Too dark to see... glimpses of violent motion in the stainless steel cabinets... the sounds of STRUGGLE continue... 
...then something WET... and the struggle stops.

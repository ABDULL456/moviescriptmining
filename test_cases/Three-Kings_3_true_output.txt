TROY'S POV TURNS TO THE SIDE -- 
FISH EYE LENS - The Jaguar pulls up in SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION. 
Imam's Little Girl gets out of the passenger side, SLIGHTLY SLOW MOTION, NO SOUND. Imam scolds her and gesticulates, indicating she should be back with the others where it is safe. The Little Girl embraces Imam and stares down at Troy over her father's shoulder. 
EXT. DESERT 
Troy's eyes are wide, staring up at the Girl as he has great difficulty breathing. Archie rolls Troy's shirt up, exposing Troy's chest, with the bullet wound. Archie points to a spot on Troy's upper chest, near the collar bone -- 
Doc squeezes a small tube of brown disinfectant gel onto this spot -- the only sounds are the squirt of the ointment and Troy's breathing. 
Archie looks nervous, then focussed as he brings the shiny metal scalpel down. Troy is in great pain as he watches Archie plunge the scalpel into his upper chest. Archie twists the scalpel to open the incision wide -- 
There is a pronounced HISSING as trapped air rushes out. Huge relief comes over Troy's face as he breathes normally. 
Regular sound FADES BACK IN, THE FIRST SOUND IS THE GIRL'S THIN, INTERMITTENT HUMMING -- 
TROY'S POV FROM THE GROUND, LOOKING UP 
ARCHIE GATES I've been waiting 18 years to get that right. 
He tears open a short I.V. tube and plunges the I.V. into the scalpel hole. There is a small valve on the end of the tube, which he tightens. 
A GUNSHOT SOUNDS -- Archie turns and looks over -- 
EXT. DESERT 
FIVE SHIITE RIFLE MEN chase down and shoot, at 30 yards, the last Iraqi gunner in the desert. 
Troy sits up slowly and watches for a moment. 
EXT. FRONT OF THE BUNKER - LATER 
Shiite women and children chant and pray around Vig's corpse as it lies in the open trunk of the Jaguar. Archie, Troy and Doc stand together watching. Troy and Doc do a muted version of Vig's Karate arm dance as they look down at his corpse. 
TROY He's got no family. 
Archie sadly takes Vig's big pistol from Vig's clenched hand. 
ARCHIE GATES We're his family now. 
DOC He wanted to go to one of those shrines. 
IMAM Kajatar in Iran. We can take him. 
Archie takes Vig's glasses off. 
ARCHIE GATES Good. Take him. 
EXT. DESERT - LATER 
Archie fills a single rusted oil drum with gold bars and tapes it shut. Troy sits in a folding chair nearby. He looks pained and uncomfortable. 
ARCHIE GATES Air pressure will build up about every fifteen minutes. Release the valve, close it up again. 
Archie unscrews the valve on the tube in Troy's chest, and air hisses out. Troy looks relieved. Archie closes the valve. 
TROY How long can I keep doing this? 
ARCHIE GATES Maybe four hours, if you're not bleeding too bad inside. 
TROY I'm really thirsty. 
DOC There's no water anywhere. 
IMAM (to Archie) I got you hooked up if you want to call your man. 
EXT. DESERT - LATER 
Archie operates a radio hooked up to a car battery. 
ARCHIE GATES (into the radio) Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, do you read me? 
DOC We're gonna be court-martialed. 
ARCHIE GATES No, we're not. 
Troy watches, tense. 
ARCHIE GATES (into the radio) Tar Baby, this is Brer Rabbit, are you reading this? 
EXT. DESERT - DAY 
Walter drives the motorcycle, nude, wearing his helmet with radio attachment. Smithson and Paco ride along. 
Archie is heard in a crackling radio transmission inside Walter's helmet. Walter speaks into the small mouthpiece. 
WALTER (into radio) This is Tar Baby, come in. 
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.) Where are you? 
WALTER (into radio) About two clicks outside camp. 
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.) We're about ready for the briar patch, over. 
WALTER (into the radio) Right. 
He looks uncertain, worried. 
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.) You got me, Tar Baby? 
WALTER I think so -- who handles the briar patch? 
ARCHIE GATES (O.S.) You do.

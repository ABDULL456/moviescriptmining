Brief silence. 
MAJOREK They're going to start the final resettlement now. We know what it means. We sent someone out. Zygmunt. A good man. His orders were to follow the trains out of Warsaw. He got to Sokolow. A local railwayman told him the tracks are divided, one branch leading to Treblinka. He said every day freight trains carrying people from Warsaw forked to Treblinka and returned empty. No transports of food are ever seen on that line. And civilians are forbidden to approach the Treblinka station. They're exterminating us. Won't take them long. We're sixty thousand left. Out of half a million. Mostly young people. And this time we're going to fight. We're in good shape. We're organised. We're prepared. 
SZPILMAN If you need help... 
Whistle blows. 
A little later: 
Szpilman again mounting the ramp with a hod full of bricks on his back. The noise of airplanes overhead. 
EXT. SKY - DAY 
A swarm of Russian bombers. Anti-aircraft fire. Puffs of exploding shells. 
EXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY 
The workers look up. So does Szpilman and, as he does so, the bricks slide off his hod, crashing to the ground below. 
ZICK-ZACK You! 
An SS man, ZICK-ZACK (his nickname), with a whip, approaches Szpilman. 
ZICK-ZACK Here! 
Szpilman goes to him. Enraged, Zick-Zack grabs him by the hair and presses his head hard between his thighs and then beats him mercilessly. 
ZICK-ZACK (with every stroke, hissing through clenched teeth) Und-zick! Und-zack! Und-zick! Und- zack! 
After a dozen or so strokes, Szpilman falls forward and lies in the dirt. Zick-Zack nods, satisfied. 
ZICK-ZACK Get him away from here. 
Two Poles, without armbands, one of them Bartczak, drag him away. 
Bartczak and the other man help Szpilman to his feet. 
BARTCZAK Hope you played the piano better than you carry bricks. 
POLISH WORKMAN He won't last long if he goes on like this. 
BARTCZAK I'll see if I can get him something better. 
INT./EXT. STORES AND BUILDING SITE - DAY 
Winter. Rain. Cold. The store, a wooden hut, contains wood, nails, tools, paint, metal brackets. 
Szpilman sits at a table, where a line of workers has formed. Szpilman makes a record in a ledger of the tools each worker takes out on the site. 
A worker puts his head into the store. 
WORKER (hissing) Trouble. 
A GERMAN VOICE Assemble! Fall in! Only the Jews! Poles go on working! Only the Jews! Poles go on working! 
The Jewish workers start to assemble on the site in haphazard ranks as an SS Captain strides in. 
The SS Captain, with much jollity and jokes, hops up on to scaffolding and stands, beaming broadly, surveying the workers. 
SS CAPTAIN (in English) I have important and good news for you. There are rumours circulating that resettlement measures are again going to be taken. 
A glance between Szpilman and Majorek. 
SS CAPTAIN (in English) I want to assure you personally that no such measures will be taken now or in the future. Posters will be going up also to this effect. As proof of our good will, we want you to select a delegate, who will be permitted to go into town once a day to buy, on each worker's behalf, five kilos of potatoes and one loaf of bread, which you will be allowed to take back into the ghetto. Now, why would we do that j if we meant to resettle you? 
He beams; no reaction from the workers. 
SS CAPTAIN (in English) You can do good business on what you don't eat. Isn't that what you Jews are best at? Making 'geld'? 
Rubs thumb and forefinger and leers; still no reaction; his smile vanishes. 
SS CAPTAIN (in English) Carry on. 
EXT. BUILDING SITE - DAY 
Snow. Majorek pulls a barrow by a rope attached to its shaft across the site. On the barrow, five sacks. The Jewish workers are phased to see him.

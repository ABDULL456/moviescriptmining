A blurred dark picture with lights dancing around. It is what Billy's eyes are seeing when she tries to focus after her fall. She sees the blurred picture of Lyosha running down the emergency ladder along the wall of the building. 
KAREN (voice over) Hello! The corner of the building. A shadow is moving hidden by the building. 
KAREN (voice over) Hello ? 
Lyosha is bending over Billy. When he hears Karen's voice, he looks up. 
KAREN (voice over) Is anybody there ? 
Karen appears at the corner of the building, looking around. 
LYOSHA Come here, quickly ! 
Karen runs toward them. 
KAREN Oh, my God, Billy. 
LYOSHA Quickly ! 
Karen runs toward Billy, still lying on the film boxes in the foreground. She bends over her. 
KAREN What did happen ? 
LYOSHA I don't know. 
Lyosha looks up at the gallery where Billy fell from. 
LYOSHA She slipped and fall bad. Poor Billy. 
Karen yells in Andy's direction. 
KAREN Andy, she's at the back ! 
LYOSHA Get the doctor, quickly. 
KAREN You go. I'll stay here with her. 
Billy is trying to say something to her sister. 
KAREN Let go of her. 
LYOSHA No, I must hold her. She must not move. 
Lyosha's hand is restraining Billy's arm. LYOSHA Danger she'll never walk again if she move. 
Billy is moving nervously, trying to get her arm free to talk to her sister. 
LYOSHA Go ! 
KAREN Yeah, okay. 
Billy tries to move her hand away from Lyosha and bangs on a film box. 
KAREN (yelling in voice over) Andy ! 
She bends over Billy. 
KAREN Billy !... Billy, you mustn't move... You may become paralyzed. It's dangerous... Don't worry. I'll be right back... I promise. 
Karen starts moving away from Billy 
KAREN Andy ! 
Billy moves nervously, raises from the film boxes and looks desperately at Karen. 
Karen just saw Billy's last expression and seems worried. 
Billy is trying to articulate some words. Karen runs back toward Billy. She reaches the pile of film boxes and bend over Billy. She looks at Lyosha. 
Andy is walking toward them. 
ANDY What's going on ?

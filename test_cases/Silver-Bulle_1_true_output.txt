He rolls over on his back and sticks the silver bullet blindly into one chamber of the cylinder and slams the cylinder closed. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU 
WEREWOLF Bastard Marty! 
INT.  MARTY 
He points the gun and pulls the trigger. There's only a click. An expression of dismay on his face. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, CU 
WEREWOLF Kill you... 
INT.  MARTY 
He drags himself so he's half propped against the hall wall. He pulls the trigger again. Click! Dismay becomes fear. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF 
It's reached the Silver Bullet. It smashes it aside. The Bullet hits the wall. 
INT.  MARTY 
Holding the gun in both hands now, he pulls the trigger a third time. Click! 
The WEREWOLF'S shadow falls over him. 
INT.  WEREWOLF, ECU 
WEREWOLF Bastard Marty! 
It bends down, reaching. 
INT.  MARTY, ECU 
Craning back as if to drive himself into the wall, he pulls the trigger again. 
INT.  THE BARREL OF THE .22 MAXI-CLOSE 
The bullet flies from the barrel, gleaming silver. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF 
The silver bullet strikes him in his one remaining eye. He flies backward, hands clapped to his gushing face... and crashes into MARTY'S Silver Bullet wheelchair. It sits there, roaring... and then it begins to change. 
INT.  THE LIVING ROOM, WITH JANE 
She lies there, sobbing. 
UNCLE AL (voice) You okay, Janey? 
INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE 
UNCLE AL is bloody and staggering but on his feet. He helps JANE up. 
JANE I'm all right... but Marty! Ma- 
SOUND: SHATTERING ROAR. 
INT.  THE WEREWOLF, ECU 
Its hands drop from its face. It is now blind in both eyes; it is half WEREWOLF and half LOWE. 
It BELLOWS again, convulses... and dies. 
INT.  MARTY, ON THE FLOOR 
MARTY (calls) I'm all right. He's dead. 
INT.  UNCLE AL AND JANE 
Here's a creature that is mostly FATHER LOWE collapsed in the remains of MARTY'S wheelchair; beyond it, MARTY is lying on the floor. UNCLE AL goes by the corpse. JANE starts by... and LOWE sits bolt upright for a moment, grasping blindly at her. 
She shrieks and darts aside. LOWE falls back, now really dead. I think. Until the sequel. 
INT.  THE HALL, WITH UNCLE AL, JANE, AND MARTY 
UNCLE AL puts a comforting arm around JANE, who is sobbing again- hell, I'd be sobbing after that last one, myself- and draws her down beside himself and MARTY. 
UNCLE AL (to MARTY) There. I told you there weren't any such things as werewolves. 
They smile at each other with love. 
JANE (nervous) Are you sure it's dead? Or him? Or whatever it is? 
UNCLE AL If it isn't now, it will be after I pound one of your mother's silver candlesticks through its heart. 
JANE (grimaces) Oh Uncle Al, no! 
UNCLE AL (grim) Oh yes, Janey. When I believe something, I believe it all the way. 
He gets up and leaves. 
JANE Are you all right, Marty?

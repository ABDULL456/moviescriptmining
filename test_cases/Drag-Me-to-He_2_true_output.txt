RAY Are you okay? 
She waves him off, clearing her throat. Tries to smile demurely, but erupts with a harsh cough. She's choking on something and is trying to bring it up from deep within her throat. With all her might she emits a BARK and a large black fly buzzes out of her mouth. 
TRUDY Oh! OH MY GOD! The fly lazily BUZZES across the table, slowly circling Trudy's head. Trudy spits out a mouthful of harvest cake into her napkin. George lowers his fork and pushes away his plate of unclean farm cake. Ray is baffled, too stunned to speak. Stephanie's gaze shifts to the kitchen door. From The other side, she hears the sound of a hoofs. Ray tries to cover for Stephanie: 
RAY I'm so sorry, Stephanie. I don't know how that fly got. into your-- 
STEPHANIE --Wait. What's that sound? 
TRUDY What sound-? 
STEPHANIE SHHH! Listen! Trudy listens along with the others. They can't hear anything. But Stephanie hears the FOOTSTEPS drawing closer. 
TRUDY I'm sorry, I can't hear anything. 
STEPHANIE (mutters under her breath) Must be deafer than a post! But Trudy heard that and takes offense. But before she can say anything, a SHADOW appears at the base of the door. Stephanie stands and shouts at it: 
STEPHANIE 
T Leave me alone! Just leave me the fuck alone! Stephanie grabs her dinner plate and hurls it just past Trudy's head. It shatters against the base of the door, spraying everyone with bits of broken china and fish. The shadow and FOOTSTEPS are gone. Ray rushes to her side. 
RAY Steph, it's okay! There's nothing there. She looks about. George and Trudy regard Stephanie as if she were mad. 
STEPHANIE I... I think I'd better go. 
TRUDY I think that's best, dear. She heads for the door. Ray starts to go after her but his 
mother stops him. 
TRUDY Let her go, Ray. She's a sick girl. 
RAY She needs me. Trudy grabs Ray's arm. 
TRUDY I'm telling you not to go after her. Ray gently pulls free of his mother's grasp and chases after Stephanie. 
EXT. DALTON HOUSE - MOMENTS LATER 
Ray rushes outside stopping Stephanie as she is about to get into her car. 
RAY What did you see in there?

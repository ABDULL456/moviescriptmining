THE RASTA makes a sad face, SNIFFLES, still dangling the key. 
SCHUYLER If I take that stupid key, will you give me back my briefcase and go away? 
The rasta nods with a big grin.  Schuyler steps forward, hand extended.  The rasta flings open the door of a STALL beside him and hurls the key into the TOILET.  Instinctively, Schuyler moves to grab it, reaches into the toilet, pulls out the chain, his hand and sleeve DRIPPING.  The key is missing from the end of the chain. 
SCHUYLER What the fuck am I doing?! 
RASTA MAN Don' worry, mon, it's a world a shit. 
He drops the rasta schtick, speaks with an Ivy League accent: 
RASTA MAN So try looking at it through rose- colored glasses... here. 
He takes off his sunglasses, folds them and tucks them in the pocket of Schuyler's suit.  Then he reaches above him and pulls down the briefcase, which was perched on top of the stall. Schuyler grabs it from him, raises his voice: 
SCHUYLER I told you, this is over!  I quit! 
RASTA MAN They all say that at first. 
He gives Schuyler a hearty SLAP on the back and strolls off, HUMMING.  Schuyler leans against the wall, shaking his head.  He puts down his luggage, pulls the sunglasses from his pocket. 
CLOSE ON SUNGLASSES-- there's the image of a tiny GOLD KEY embossed on each of the arms. 
SCHUYLER puts them on, looks around for a moment, catches a GLIMPSE of himself in the mirror-- he looks silly.  He quickly takes them off.  As Schuyler heads out the door we see him from behind... the Rasta has slapped a colorful SIGN that reads "KICK ME" on his back. 
CUT TO: 
53.  E X T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y 
THE NEON SIGN FIZZLES in front of this low-rent establishment. 
54.  I N T .   L E O ' S  -  D A Y 
BELLS RING and LIGHTS FLASH as a DRUNK plays a PINBALL MACHINE with a lot of body English.  SCHUYLER, stuck at a table right next to the machine, winces at the noise, checks his watch and rises.  He makes his way through the lunch hour CROWD to the bar, leans toward the bartender, a gravelly-voiced woman-- RONNIE. 
SCHUYLER I was supposed to meet someone here, a David Van Orton-- I was wondering if he'd left a message. 
RONNIE 'Fraid not, sorry. 
He drums his fingers, then whips out a CELLPHONE, spins around quickly as he starts to dial-- 
--and SMACKS into Christine the waitress as she emerges from the kitchen carrying a tray-- 
--SCHUYLER gets hit in the chest with a TRAY OF DESSERTS, colorful JELLO, CREAM PIE, etc.  He stands there, stunned and DRIPPING. 
CHRISTINE Fuck me! 
She starts picking up plates and silverware, oblivious to Schuyler's own plight; Ronnie charges out from behind the bar. After the first shock, Schuyler CHUCKLES with annoyance.  He wipes the phone clean, pocketing it. 
SCHUYLER Oh this is cute.  Very cute. 
RONNIE What happened here, you OK? 
CHRISTINE It was an accident-- 
SCHUYLER No it wasn't. 
Ronnie gives Christine a look as she starts wiping at Schuyler with a rag.  He picks at his chest, examines the WHIPPED CREAM, tastes it.  Schuyler addresses the kneeling Christine: 
SCHUYLER What's next, a giant banana peel? 
CHRISTINE squints up at him, puzzled. 
CHRISTINE Huh?  Oh I get it-- you're nuts. 
RONNIE Chrissy, just apologize... 
CHRISTINE Dickhead here was on the phone, he walked right into me! 
SCHUYLER Drop the act, you've been waiting all day for this moment. 
CHRISTINE Shut the fuck up. 
RONNIE Go home, you're fired. 
CHRISTINE What?... 
RONNIE You heard me. 
CHRISTINE Fuck you too. 
She THROWS a plate on the ground, it shatters, then storms off into the kitchen.  Schuyler CHUCKLES angrily, pushing through the slop on the floor with his shoe, looking for something. 
SCHUYLER Let's get this over with... Where's the next key?  Does she have it? 
Ronnie stares, uncomprehending... Schuyler goes after Christine. 
55.  I N T .   L E O ' S   K I T C H E N  -  D A Y 
He crosses past a short-order COOK in the grimy industrial kitchen, pulling a cube of JELLO out of his lapel pocket.  He finds Christine in an alcove with a couple of lockers, as she finishes changing into her street clothes.  Her brown uniform hangs from a locker door, the nameplate "CHRIS" prominent. 
CLOSE as his fingers touch the CRS of CHRIS-- they even look a bit brighter than the H and the I. 
SCHUYLER I wish you people could be a little more subtle.

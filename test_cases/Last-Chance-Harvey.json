{"train": "LAST CHANCE HARVEY \nWritten by \nJoel Hopkins \nSound of a piano being played. Sparse but beautiful. \nFADE IN: \nINT. RECORDING ROOM - DAY \nHARVEY SHINE, mid-60's, sits at a piano in a scruffy recording room, tinkering. We hold on his slightly sad, intense gaze. Just then a shaft of crude light illuminates him, accompanied by a knocking sound. From behind a studio window, JOHNNIE, a young rocker type in his 20's beckons. Harvey closes the piano lid. \nINT. STUDIO - DAY \nJohnnie, unpacking his lunch and turning on various buttons, sits at a mixing desk. In front of him are 2 large TV monitors. Harvey joins him. \nHARVEY Put my score up first. \nJOHNNIE They don't want to hear it, Harvey. \nHARVEY I know, but I want to hear it. Put it up. \nJOHNNIE I'm backed up already, Harvey. \nHARVEY (interrupting) Johnnie, you were the one that was late. Just put it up. \nJohnnie reluctantly presses various buttons. \nA `cheesy' commercial for a washing detergent plays. It is accompanied by a jolly classical score. Harvey looks on forlornly at his work. As it comes to an end with a flourish, Harvey lowers his head. Beat. Johnnie glances at him. \nJOHNNIE Listen, Harvey. Marvin wants me to present my ideas while your away. \nHarvey looks up, confused. \nHARVEY Huh? \nJOHNNIE Look, I'm not doing myself any favours here, Harvey. But, I'd watch your back. \nWe hold on Harvey's tired, pensive face. \nINT. STUDIO CAR PARK / QUEENS - DAY \nHarvey hurriedly exits the studio, catching up with a man walking to his car. \nHARVEY Marvin? Hey, Marvin? \nMARVIN Hey, Harvey. Shouldn't you be in London? \nHARVEY Yeah, I'm heading there now. What's going on? \nMARVIN Huh? \nHARVEY Johnnie said something about you wanting him to present on Monday. \nMARVIN Oh yeah, No, I was just thinking that, what with you being in London - you should stay a while. \nHARVEY What? \nMARVIN There's no need to rush back. Enjoy your daughter's wedding. \nHARVEY What? \nMARVIN Well, Johnnie can do it. I mean, he can pitch the Samuelson account. \nHARVEY No, I'm coming back. Those are my connections. They have been for years. \nMARVIN I know but... they've got new people running things over there. I think they're after something... (beat) ...different. \nHarvey nods. \nWOMAN (CONT'D) (feeling obliged) Yourself? \nHARVEY My daughter's getting married. \nWOMAN Congratulations. \nHARVEY (smiles) Thank you. (beat) She's marrying an American. But for some reason we've all got to go over to London. (smiling) I told her we had a perfectly good wedding system here. (MORE) \nHARVEY (CONT'D) (beat/expecting more of a response) They both work there, you see. \nThe woman smiles again, then looks up as the Stewardess returns with Harvey's drink. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Thank you. \nHarvey is about to continue speaking when the woman interrupts. \nWOMAN I'm really sorry but I have a meeting in the morning and I must try and get some sleep. \nHARVEY No... Of course. I'm sorry. \nWOMAN It's just, I'll be useless - unless I get some sleep. \nHARVEY Sure. \nThe woman covers herself in a blanket and turns out her light, turning herself away from Harvey. \nWe hold on Harvey from a distance, spotlit in a sea of darkness. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nSound of a commercial London Radio Station. A `phone-in' competition takes place. \nFADE IN: \nEXT. SUBURBAN STREET - MORNING \nA radio hangs from a mail trolley. KATE, mid 40's, dressed in a green uniform, turns into the path of a suburban house. She passes a postman - who nods his head. \nPOSTMAN Morning Kate. Looking lovely as ever. If I was younger... \nKATE Careful Paddy. (pointing to her cheek) Blushing! Is she up? \nPOSTMAN Oh yes. \nKate smiles before unlocking the front door. \nINT. HALLWAY - MORNING \nKate comes through the door, picking up a small pile of mail off the floor. \nKATE (calling out) Mum. It's me - your daughter. \nINT. KITCHEN - MORNING \nKate puts the mail on a kitchen table. Just then MAGGIE, Kate's mum, enters in her dressing gown. \nMAGGIE Hello, my daughter. \nThey kiss. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Have a cup of tea with me. \nKATE I can't, I'm running late. \nMaggie seems to ignore this piece of information and heads to the kettle. Filling it up, she peers out the back window. \nMAGGIE He's at it again. \nKATE Scum. \nAggie giggles to herself and writes it in. Kate stands just as another co-worker hurries in. \nOONAGH Sorry. Sorry. \nShe kisses Kate on the cheek and opens her locker. \nOONAGH (CONT'D) Thank God you're my boss. \nWithout looking up, Aggie `tuts' and shakes her head. Oonagh decides to ignore. \nOONAGH (CONT'D) Are we still on for tonight? Matt's definitely bringing Simon. \nKATE No. \nOONAGH Please. \nKATE Only if you guys swear you won't leave if it's not going well. \nOONAGH No way. \nKATE Promise? \nOONAGH Promise. \nAGGIE Seven down. Another word for `souvenir'? \nKate thinks for a beat. \nKATE Memento. \nAggie laughs and scribbles it in. Oonagh rolls her eyes. \nOONAGH Aggie, why do you bother? You just get Kate to give you all the answers. \nAggie `tuts' again and waves Oonagh away. Kate hands Oonagh a clip-board and the two of them head out. \nINT. BAGGAGE CAROUSEL - DAY \nAs luggage spews out, a dishevelled Harvey looks on. He sees his case and awkwardly pulling it from the belt, heads off. \nINT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY \nOonagh and Kate stand next to each other, interviewing returning travellers. Kate interviews an elderly couple. It's clear she's good at her job. \nKATE So you spent the whole 2 weeks in the Toronto area? \nELDERLY MAN Yes. Our daughter lives there, see. \nKATE Ah. (filling in a form) So not a business trip then? \nELDERLY MAN Oh, no. Unless you count grand- children as work. \nKATE (smiles) Some might. \nINT. ARRIVAL DOORS \nHarvey comes through a set of sliding double doors, wheeling his case behind him. \nINT. ARRIVALS HALL - DAY \nKate finishes up the interview with the elderly couple, and turns to see an approaching Harvey in the distance. She registers his attempts to steer a wide berth of her, but matches his movements, bringing him to a stop. \nKATE Sorry, I couldn't just ask you a few very quick questions, could I? \nHARVEY I'm sorry, but I'm in a bit of a hurry. \nKATE It won't take a moment. \nJust then, to his relief, his phone rings. He hurries over to the bed and retrieves it. \nHARVEY Hello? (beat) Suzie! Hi darling. Yes, I'm here. Where are you - where is everyone? (listens/Harvey's face drops a little) Oh...I see. No, I didn't realise. I thought the plan was for everyone to stay together. \nNoticeably dejected, Harvey sits down on the bed. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) No its...fine. I just wasn't sure. (beat) (MORE) \nHARVEY (CONT'D) So your mother has rented a house for you all. (beat) I see. No, no, don't be silly. I'm a big boy. It's fine. \nHarvey looks around the bland room. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Home from home. (beat) Yes, I've got the address. So, I'll see you there. (beat) I love you too. Bye. \nHarvey hangs up. \nEXT. STREET - DUSK \nKate, dressed for the evening, hurries along a street. Her phone rings. \nKATE Mum? \nINT. KITCHEN - DUSK \nKate's mum stands not far from her back window. \nMAGGIE What are you wearing? \nEXT. STREET - DUSK \nKATE Dungarees. \nINT. KITCHEN - DUSK \nMAGGIE Oh, you're not! \nEXT. STREET - DUSK \nKATE They're completely in again, haven't you heard? \nINT. KITCHEN - DUSK \nMAGGIE (lifting back the curtain) Oh, you're just being silly. \nPOV: A now bare chested Neighbour at work in his garden. Smoke rising from his shed. \nMAGGIE (CONT'D) Now don't be nervous. Just be yourself. \nEXT. STREET - DUSK \nKATE (smiling) Ok, mum. Thanks for the advice. \nINT. KITCHEN - DUSK \nMAGGIE Oh, listen. I've been thinking about Greece for our holiday. \nEXT. STREET - DUSK \nKATE (frowns) Ok, Let's talk about it later. (beat) I love you too. \nKate hangs up and crosses a busy road. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DUSK \nKate's mum continues to spy. POV: The Neighbour bends down out of sight. On rising again, he sees Maggie at the window and waves. Maggie flinches, before dropping the curtain. \nINT. PUB - DUSK \nKate comes through the door. Oonagh sits on her own at a booth. Kate joins her. \nHarvey enters the room. He sees his daughter, standing off to one side, with Scott, talking to some friends. \nShe looks beautiful. He takes a moment to just watch her. As she turns in slight slow motion, she smiles on seeing her father and joins him. \nSUSAN Hi Dad. \nHARVEY Suz... (beat) You look beautiful. \nSUSAN Thank you. \nSlightly awkward pause. \nHARVEY Give us a hug then, as they say in this country. \nThey embrace. Beat. Off Susan's look... \nHARVEY (CONT'D) I know, I look ridiculous. \nSUSAN No. You look... \nHARVEY Like a bad lounge act. \nSusan smiles at her Father. Beat. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) I spilt something on my trousers. (beat) I've been doing that a lot recently. \nHarvey looks over at Scott in the distance, sharing a laugh with his buddies. \nSUSAN Dad. \nHARVEY Long way to come to see two American kids get married. \nSusan looks at her father, a little irked. \nSUSAN Sorry for the inconvenience, Dad. \nHarvey looks at his daughter. \nHARVEY Sorry. \nBeat. \nSUSAN Have you seen mum yet? \nHARVEY No. They're here? \nSUSAN Yes. They're over by our table. \nHarvey looks over. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) Please Daddy. \nHARVEY What? (beat) I'll be good. \nJust then, they are approached by Scott guiding some friends over to say hello. \nSCOTT Look who i've got! \nSusan's girlfriends shriek with delight as they approach. Susan turns to greet them. \nHARVEY I'll speak to you later Suz. You enjoy your friends. \nAs Susan greets her friends, Harvey retreats. \nINT. PUB - NIGHT \nKate rejoins the others. Oonagh and Matt are standing. Matt has his jacket on. \nOONAGH (to Kate) We've gotta go. Problem at home. Baby-sitter just rang. Nothing serious. (MORE) \nJILL Hi Harvey. You look well. \nHARVEY Thank you, Jill. You're looking well too. Both of you. I guess you guys stayed in touch with Jean. \nAwkward Beat. \nBRIAN Barry and I work together now. \nHARVEY No kidding? Insurance? \nBARRY No. (beat) Property, now. A small portfolio down in Florida. \nHARVEY Real Estate. That's great. (beat) That's really great. \nAwkward silence. \nBRIAN Well I think we should sit. I know Susan wanted us all seated before they joined us. \nHARVEY Sure. Good idea. \nEveryone begins to take their assigned seats. Harvey is on the inside close to the middle. It's a bit tight and involves people getting up to make way. Harvey gets to his seat and is just about to sit when his phone rings. Brian and Jean share a look. Taking it out of his pocket Harvey looks at the incoming number. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Sorry, I have to take this. (picks up) Can you hold a minute? \nHarvey makes his way back along the table, causing people to stand again. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Sorry. Sorry. \nHarvey walks away from the table. \nINT. PUB - NIGHT \nKate sits waiting. Simon has finally been served and turns from the bar with drinks in hand. As he does a young woman, standing with a small party of two other girls and a guy, greets him. Kate looks on. It's obvious from Simon's reaction that they know each other well. Just then Kate's phone rings again. She looks at the number and thinks about ignoring it, but in the end, reluctantly picks up. \nKATE Mum. You've got to stop calling. (beat) What? I can't hear. Hold on. \nKate gets up and moves towards the back-room. \nINT. RESTAURANT FOYER - NIGHT \nHarvey stands on the phone. \nHARVEY (getting more and more flustered) It'll take two hours max. No longer. (listens) Have you told him its Harvey? Look, we go back! He'll tell you. Just have him call me. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nHarvey returns to the table. Everyone is seated. \nHARVEY Sorry... \nHe notices his name place has been moved to the end. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) (smiling/to Jean) Did you move me darling? \nJEAN No, Harvey. I didn't touch it. \nSUSAN Dad. I moved you. I thought it might be easier in case you needed to get out. \nHARVEY Ok, sweetheart. \nHarvey takes the last remaining seat. Brian stands. \nBRIAN Shall we have a quick toast to get things going? (beat) I'm going to save my big speech for tomorrow. (laughter) Dear Susan and Dear Scott, I just want to take us all back to that wonderful holiday we all had in Rome together last year and wish you `Salute'! \nEVERYONE Salute! \nBRIAN Jean and I love you both so much. And we're so happy that Scott is going to part of our clan now. And so I say many, many, happy, happy years ahead. Salute! \nEVERYONE Salute! \nMELISSA What? Men in white. Oh, I do. \nKate looks on as the girls laugh. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nHarvey sits at the end of the table, looking on, as everyone talks animatedly around him. He eats his food and drinks plenty of wine. Up near the middle Scott shares a joke with Brian. Just then Susan, who has been talking to the best man, turns and catches her father's eye. He smiles at her and raises a glass. Susan smiles back before returning her attention back to her neighbour. \nINT. PUB BOOTH - NIGHT \nKate sits among the group. She too seems to be detached from the proceedings. \nGWEN I heard that they did it in her bedroom, while she was away. \nSIMON It was her flat? \nGWEN Yep. He has his own, but was basically living at hers. \nANDREW Ouch. \nMELISSA That is evil. \nAs the conversation continues in this vein, Kate glances at Simon. He seems more at ease in this company. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nThe meal is drawing to a close. People have gotten up and are circulating around the table and nearby. \nINT. BAR AREA - NIGHT \nHarvey stands at the bar. He downs a drink. Jean approaches. \nJEAN Harvey. \nHARVEY Hello Jean. \nJEAN (to barman) Can I get a glass of water please? \nThe Barman obliges. \nJEAN (CONT'D) You Ok? \nHARVEY (Downing another drink) Fine. \nBeat. \nJEAN Go easy Harvey. \nHARVEY (getting quite loaded) Why, Jean? Are you worried i'm going to embarrass you again? \nJEAN No Harvey, I'm worried you're going to embarrass yourself. (beat) And more importantly Susan. This weekend's just about her and Scott. Nothing else. \nHARVEY Oh, you're good Jean. You're really good. You've always known how to make me feel shit, haven't you? (beat) You've always been so good at that. \nJEAN I've had cause to practice. \nBeat. \nHARVEY Tell me, Jean. Were you ever proud of me? \nJEAN Yes. Sometimes. (beat) But you never listened. \nHARVEY The parties Jean. The fuckin' parties, where I would hear you - dressing up what I did for a living - film composer this, film composer that - trying to make it more palatable for your friends. I'm a... \nJEAN (cutting him off) Don't Harvey. \nBeat. \nHARVEY What is it you see in Brian? \nBeat. \nSUSAN (CONT'D) You having to leave early this weekend. I don't know, it just seems typical. \nHARVEY (flash of irritation) It's work darling. It pays for things. (beat/sighs) Sorry. Look, I... \nSUSAN (interrupting) I'm sorry Dad, but it's what I've decided. \nHarvey momentarily turns away from his daughter, to compose himself, before turning back. \nHARVEY Sure. (beat) I understand, Suz. \nHarvey leans in and kisses his daughter on the forehead. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) You go and be with your friends. Go and enjoy yourself. (pulls out his phone) I gotta make some stupid calls. You know. Go and enjoy yourself, Sweetheart. I'll see you tomorrow. \nSusan reluctantly walks away as Harvey lifts the phone to his ear. We hold on his face. With Susan gone he lowers the phone. He looks frightened. \nINT. MEN'S ROOM - NIGHT \nHarvey enters the rest-room and heads to a bank of basins. He turns on a tap and bends down - drinking profusely. He splashes his face then rises and begins to dry it with some paper towels. \nHARVEY You fuckin' asshole! \nHarvey suddenly bends over as though he'd been punched hard in the stomach. He rises, red in the face, holding his nose, desperately trying to hold it in. But he can't - Harvey sobs huge heaving muffled cries... \nJust then, someone enters. Head down, Harvey lunges for the door and exits. \nEXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nHarvey stumbles out of the restaurant and into a waiting cab. The cab pulls away. \nINT. PUB - NIGHT \nKate sits surrounded by laughter. Simon's attention is firmly fixed on his friends. Kate's humiliation is magnified as we slowly move into her face. \nKATE Sorry. \nKate gets up and walks away. Everyone momentarily stops chatting and looks to Simon, who shrugs. \nINT. LADIES - NIGHT \nKate enters a cubicle. She sits down to have a pee. We hold on her sad face. She suddenly grimaces, before holding firm. But not before a tear has been expelled and rolls down her cheek. She swats it away. \nINT. TAXI - NIGHT \nWe hold on Harvey's sad face as it gently bobs in the back of a moving cab. \nEXT. PUB - NIGHT \nKate exits the pub, just as a cab pulls up. As Harvey exits one side, Kate gets into the other, as the cab pulls away again. \nFADE TO BLACK. \nFADE IN: \nINT. REGISTRY OFFICE - MORNING \nBride and Groom stand at the head of the room, saying their vows. Harvey stands near the back, looking on. As the ceremony is concluded the audience spontaneously burst into applause. Harvey looks around the room, then back at his daughter, as she smiles giddily at her husband. Harvey slips out the door. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nCarrying his case, Harvey hails a Taxi and gets in. \nINT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY \nKate, back in green, stands next to a young couple asking them questions about their travel arrangements. \nEXT. STREET - DAY \nHarvey looks about him. \nINT. TERMINAL 3 - DAY \nHarvey sits holding his phone. He dials a number, lifting the phone to his ear. He gets voice-mail. \nHARVEY Marvin. It's Harvey. Listen, there's been a mess up, the traffic was crazy. I'm going to have to reschedule the pitch slightly. Frank can set up. I'll email him the cue numbers - he knows what to do. And then I'll be there lunch- time at the latest. I'll come straight from the airport. I'll try you again shortly. \nHarvey hangs up and stares at the phone. Beat. He looks up and around the Terminal. A young child has a tantrum nearby. Suddenly his phone rings. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Hello? \nMARVIN I got your message. \nHARVEY The traffic was insane. But listen... \nMARVIN (interrupting) The traffic, Harvey? Jesus! \nBeat. Marvin sighs. \nMARVIN (CONT'D) Listen, Harvey. Stay in London. Enjoy your daughter's wedding. We'll talk when you get back. \nHARVEY It's fine, I'll be there lunch- time. It's no problem. Steve knows what I need. Mike's coming in. It's all set u... \nMARVIN (interrupting) Harvey! \nSilence. \nMARVIN (CONT'D) It's over. (beat/sighs) It's out of my hands Harvey. I have people to answer to. We just can't afford the space. (beat) We're letting you go. \nHARVEY Letting me go? Can't afford the space? Marvin, I'll be there lunch- time. \nBeat. \nMARVIN I'm sorry Harvey. (beat/sighs) Call me when you get back. \nThe line goes dead. Harvey closes his phone. Beat. He stares ahead into space, then stands and walks away. \nINT. BOOTH - DAY \nKate closes up the booth. \nINT. TERMINAL 3 / CHEZ GERARD (BAR/RESTAURANT) - DAY \nKate sits at a table near the bar, drinking a glass of wine and reading her book. She glances up as a man enters. Harvey takes a seat at the bar. \nHARVEY Jamesons, no ice. \nThe Barman serves Harvey. Harvey immediately downs it. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Another. (beat) Please. \nThe Barman refills his glass. Again Harvey knocks it back. Kate glances up from her book. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Another, please. \nThe Barman glances at Harvey. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) What? \nBAR MAN Sorry. \nHarvey reaches for the now full glass. But knocks it, spilling it into his lap. \nHARVEY Shit! \nKate looks up again, along with the few other patrons in the bar. Harvey registers their gaze. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Sorry. Vulgar American. \nKate looks at Harvey sympathetically for a moment. \nKATE Not bad. (beat) But what can I do for you? (beat) Make it worse, maybe? \nHARVEY Let me make it up to you. (beat) Would you let me buy you lunch. What time is it - tea time? I'll buy you tea. \nKate blushes ever so slightly. \nKATE That's very sweet of you, but... I don't know you. And... you don't know me. \nHARVEY Exactly. That's why we should have lunch - tea. \nKate can't help but smile. Beat. \nKATE Thank you, but...no. \nShe indicates her book. \nHARVEY Because you've got your book. And it's a good replacement for humans. \nKate smiles and nods. Just then her phone rings. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) If that's for me I'm in the shower. \nKate smiles as she takes out her phone and looks at the incoming number. She is about to answer, when she stops herself. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Aren't you going to answer that? \nShe thinks for a moment, before putting the phone back. \nKATE No. \nHARVEY Should I take that as a hopeful sign. \nKate can't help but smile. \nKATE If it is, you could just give me a little wider smile. \nKate can't help but smile wider. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nKate's mum pulls the phone away from her ear, perplexed by the lack of response. Her eyes wander to the window. Drawing back the curtain, she looks out. POV: The Neighbour, now sporting a white apron, busies himself as usual. He suddenly bends down and heaves what would best be described as a body bag onto his shoulder. As he stumbles under the weight, he carries it into the shed. Kate's mum turns away ashen. \nINT. CHEZ GERARD - DAY \nHarvey and Kate remain seated at adjacent tables. Muzak plays in the background. They are now virtually the sole patrons of Chez Gerard. Kate eats a salad and reads her book. Just then, Harvey's food arrives. Beat. \nHARVEY Look we are having lunch together. \nKATE (looks up and smiles) No. We're having lunch next to each other. \nHARVEY Ah. (beat/suddenly holds out his hand) I'm Harvey. Harvey Shine. \nKATE (takes it) Kate. Kate Walker. \nKate can't help but smile at Harvey's persistence. Beat. She puts down her book. \nKATE (CONT'D) So why aren't you at the wedding? \nHarvey, momentarily taken aback by the directness of Kate's question, is about to answer, when the sound of a vacuum cleaner erupts. Harvey and Kate look over to see a cleaner vacuuming the floor nearby. \nHARVEY Ah, that's better. I knew something was missing. (shouting over the din) I had to get back for a work thing. \nKATE (over the din) A work thing. For the job you just lost? \nBeat. \nHARVEY (over din) Yes. \nHARVEY What? \nKATE That's all changed. We're a nation changed. Ever since Diana, we've unlocked ourselves. Everything's flowing out. (beat) You guys showed us the way. \nHARVEY Just as we're trying to adopt your stiff upper lip. \nKate smiles. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) What is a stiff upper lip, exactly? \nHarvey tries to physicalize it. \nKATE No, I think, it's more this. \nKate stretches her top lip. \nHARVEY I see. (copies her) How's that? \nKATE (top lip stretched) Yeah you're getting there. Stretch it out further. \nHARVEY Let me see again. \nKATE No, now you're doing a bulldog. \nHARVEY Like this? \nKATE No, now you look like you don't have any teeth. (beat) Are they your own? \nHARVEY What? \nKATE Your teeth? \nHARVEY The front ones. \nKATE My dad had a front one that you could just take out. \nHARVEY Really? \nAs they sit there, lips stretched, nattering away, we start to pull back. Accompanied by a simple piano score we look on as they appear to us, momentarily, like an ordinary couple. \nEXT. CHEZ GERARD - DAY \nHarvey and Kate exit the restaurant. They stand opposite each other in the quietening Terminal. \nKATE Thank you. I...enjoyed myself. \nHARVEY Yes. So did I. \nSlightly awkward pause. Kate glances at her watch. \nKATE I should get going. I have a class. \nHARVEY A class? \nKATE (a bit sheepish) Yes. A...writing class. (beat) Twice a week. Just something I do. (changing the subject) (MORE) \nKATE (CONT'D) I take the Heathrow Express. What about you? \nHarvey hadn't really thought. \nHARVEY I don't know. I guess I'll stay in a Hotel near here. My flight's in the morning. \nBeat. \nKATE Well...it's been a pleasure...Harvey Shine. \nHARVEY Yes. Yes it has. \nThey shake hands, smiling. Just then Kate's phone rings again. \nHarvey drops his suitcase off at the same hotel he was staying in before. \nAs they wander through the city, foreign students mingle, policemen chat, and office workers linger. London is at its best. \nEXT. SOUTH BANK - LATE AFTERNOON \nThe sky glows a pale orange as Harvey and Kate walk and talk along the South Bank. \nHARVEY Yours is a beautiful city, Kate. \nKate looks at Harvey a moment, then smiles. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) What? \nKATE Its just a funny way of saying it. Quite old fashioned. \nHARVEY Really? \nKATE But i like it. (beat) Yours is glorious country, Honeychurch. \nHarvey looks at Kate quizzically. \nKATE (CONT'D) It's a line from a book. `Room with a View'. \nHarvey shakes his head. \nHARVEY I'm afraid I'm not much of a reader. (beat) Too fidgety, I guess. \nKate looks at Harvey. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) You think less of me. \nKATE No, we're just quite different, that's all. \nHARVEY Is that bad? \nKATE (thinks about it) No. \nJust then Kate's phone rings again. \nHARVEY Both our phones ring a lot. We have that in common. \nKATE (smiles) Ah. \nThey come to a stop as Kate takes out her phone and looks at the handset display. \nKATE (CONT'D) Sorry. I should probably take this. \nHarvey nods. \nKATE (CONT'D) Mum? (beat) I've been busy. (beat) No, I'm out. Yes with someone. No someone else. (beat) Yes. (looks at Harvey) ...a man. \nHarvey smiles. We hear Maggie's warble continue as Kate listens. Beat. \nKATE (CONT'D) You did, did you? (beat) An actual body. \nHarvey looks at Kate. Kate shakes her head. Maggie continues. \nKATE (CONT'D) Mum. Listen. I'll come over tomorrow and we can check it out together. (beat) I have to go now. Just get an early night and i'll see you tomorrow. (beat) I love you too. \nKate hangs up. \nKATE (CONT'D) Sorry. (beat) My mother. \nHARVEY She worries about you? \nKATE And herself. (beat) She's convinced she's living next to Poland's answer to Ted Bundy. \nHARVEY I see. \nHarvey and Kate walk under Waterloo bridge past the second hand bookstalls. A man plays a saxophone melancholically. \nKATE Do you ever wish you could try a different life? (beat) Just for a day. Just to see what it would be like. \nHARVEY What would yours be? \nKATE (looks down at her uniform) Well, no green, that's for sure. \nHarvey smiles. \nKATE (CONT'D) (beat/thinks) It would take place in Spain. A little house inland. \nHARVEY And what would you do there? \nKATE Oh...I don't know... (beat) Write the great novel. (beat) I think I've got one inside me. We're not talking high art. Just a bloody good holiday read. \nBeat. \nHARVEY Ok. So this house in Spain would have a little cabana looking out over the plains for you to write in. \nKATE (smiling) Yes. \nHARVEY And a little stream running by, to bathe in. \nKATE (smiling) Sure. \nHARVEY I'm there. (beat) Sorry, that's if you're receiving guests. \nKate smiles, coming to a stop. \nKATE Sure, you can visit Harvey Shine. \nHARVEY Why, thank you Kate Walker. \nJust then a sort of Skiffle come Rockabilly busking act starts up. Two girls and a guy. They're great! Harvey and Kate stand amongst the crowd watching. The South Bank is at its vibrant best. \nEXT. SOUTH BANK - DUSK \nWith the sound of the Skiffle act still playing in the distant background, Harvey and Kate take a seat on some steps over-looking the river. As darkness descends, street-lamps reflect off the water. They sit in silence. Then... \nKATE What happened Harvey? (beat) Between you and your daughter? \nBeat. Harvey shakes his head. \nHARVEY I don't know. (beat) Somewhere along the way I lost her. I lost my family. (beat) I just woke up one morning and realised i didn't belong. \nBeat. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) I'd always had this mean little feeling in my stomach, that they were a bit embarrassed by me. (beat) If you saw them now, with Brian, Susan's step-father. You'd see, they make more sense. They look right together. \nBeat. Harvey looks out over the Thames. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) I've not been a great father. \nKate looks at Harvey's sad profile. Beat. She thinks for a moment. \nKATE The reception. It's still going on? \nHARVEY (looks at his watch) I guess. \nKATE Where? \nHarvey looks up. \nHARVEY The Grovesnor. Why? \nKate looks at Harvey. \nKATE You must go. \nThe doors open and Harvey and Kate enter. Heads turn. Jean looks up and sees Harvey with Kate. She shakes her head. Susan sees Harvey and gets up. She joins him. \nHARVEY Hey. \nSUSAN Hi. \nHARVEY I didn't go. \nSUSAN I'm glad. \nOff Susan's look, Harvey turns to Kate. \nHARVEY This is Kate. A... friend. \nKATE (sheepish) Hi. Congratulations. You look fantastic. \nSUSAN Thank you. \nSlightly awkward pause. \nKATE I'm really sorry to gate-crash. Your father sort of insisted. \nSUSAN No, it's fine. I'm sure... (looks around) ...there's room. \nSusan looks back at the full top table. \nHARVEY You get back. Don't worry about us, we'll find a place. \nKATE Yes... \nSUSAN No. (stops a passing waiter) Could you find them a seat please. \nWAITER Sure. \nPete, acting as Master of Ceremonies, stands and clinks his glass for attention. \nSUSAN I'd better go. \nPETE (MC) And now for the best man's speech. Except we seem to be missing the bride. (laughter) Oh, no, here she is. \nSusan heads back and resumes her seat at top table. The best man takes the mic... \nJOSH Scott. What can I say... \nINT. RECEPTION / BACK TABLES \nThe waiter leads Harvey and Kate to a table. \nWAITER I'm afraid this is the only place left. \nThe waiter shows them to a few empty seats at the children's table. \nHARVEY That's fine. \nHarvey and Kate take their seats. The kids stare at them. \nKATE Hi. \nA brace clad, large girl in a white frilly dress speaks. \nGIRL Are you Uncle Harvey? \nHARVEY Yes. I guess. \nGIRL I've heard about you. \nHARVEY Oh. (beat) You're not Miriam's kid are you? \nGIRL Yes. \nHARVEY (smiling) And also if he ever hurts her, I know people in north of London. \nLaughter. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Seriously though. Scott, I swear you have found in Susan a bright and passionate person. And a loyal friend. \nCONGREGATION Hear, hear! \nHARVEY And I can see from the way she looks at you. From the way she is with you, that she is... (beat) (MORE) \nHARVEY (CONT'D) ...happy. (beat) And I thank you and welcome you to the family. \nHarvey and Scott share a look. The room applauds loudly. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) And finally, if I can linger a moment longer. I would like to turn it back over to Brian, with a note of... gratitude. (beat) Thank you for being there for my baby girl. Thank you for being there, when I wasn't. \nBeat. Brian nods to Harvey, before standing and raising his glass. \nBRIAN If you would all please join Harvey and I, in a toast. (beat) To Susan and Scott. \nCONGREGATION Susan and Scott! \nEveryone claps loudly. Susan shares a gentle smile with her Father. Harvey sits and looks at Kate anxiously. Kate smiles and nods. \nKATE Well done. \nHARVEY Really? \nShe indicates to the rest of the table. Harvey turns to their now animated young neighbours, who all sit clapping. \nINT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT \nPETE (MC) Ladies and Gentlemen, the first dance. \nThe BAND strike up as Susan and Scott take to the dance floor. They dance a slow dance. Harvey and Kate sit watching. \nAfter a while Susan, looks over for her Father. Harvey hesitates, before Kate encourages him up. She plucks a flower from the table display and places it in his lapel. \nHarvey joins Susan and Scott on the dance-floor. Shaking Scott's hand, he leads Susan into a dance. \nSUSAN Thanks for coming back Dad. \nBeat. \nHARVEY Thanks for having me back. \nKate looks on, as Harvey dances happily with his daughter. Feeling something, she turns to find the eight year old's head slumped against her shoulder as he sleeps soundly. Kate smiles at her lot. \nBack on the dance-floor, Harvey encourages Brian to take over the dance with Susan. Harvey turns away and is joined by Uncle Fred and gang. They all chat animatedly. Uncle Fred pushes Harvey into a dance with his wife. A `Boogie' strikes up. \nKate looks on as Harvey dances and reunites with his extended family. She sees the delight in his face. She looks around at all the happy faces. It's time perhaps to let the family celebrate alone. \nExtricating herself from the sleeping boy, she pushes two chairs together and makes a bed for him. Covering him in a jacket, she glances back at the dance-floor before turning to leave. \nBack on the dance-floor, a `Boogie' is in full swing. Harvey caught up in the fun, energetically swings Aunt Maddie around. He suddenly catches himself and turns to his table to look for Kate, but finds it empty save for a row of dozing children. \nHarvey makes his excuses and turns away, looking for Kate amongst the crowded room. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nKate retrieves her coat and makes her way down the hall towards the bank of elevators. \nINT. RECEPTION - NIGHT \nHarvey hurries to the exit. \nINT. HALLWAY - NIGHT \nOn turning into the hall, he sees Kate standing in the distance. Just then, she steps forward and out of sight. Harvey runs. \nHARVEY Can I...? \nJust then a vacuum cleaner sounds. They both look up - as a cleaning lady vacuums the floor nearby. Beat. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Hey kid, they're playing our song. \nKate smiles. \nKATE Yes. \nIn the background we hear clapping and cheering coming from the reception. A funky number starts up. Harvey takes Kate's hand. \nHARVEY (excited) Come on. I want you to meet people. I want them to meet you. \nHarvey leads a slightly reluctant Kate back down the hall towards the reception. \nINT. RECEPTION - NIGHT \nThe band let rip on a funky tune. The congregation fill the dance-floor. \nHarvey leads Kate back into the room and heads straight for the dance-floor. As they pass relatives along the way, Harvey introduces them to Kate. Much hugging and kissing ensues. \nHarvey and Kate dance a boogie. Uncle Fred and Aunt Maddie join them. Uncle Fred steals Kate from Harvey and twirls her off. \nMONTAGE: Fun and Frolics on the dance-floor. Harvey is at the center of it all. He initiates a Horah. A Congo line. Russian dancing! Kate's face says it all - she's having a ball. The sleeping kid, sleeps. \nINT. RECEPTION / BANDSTAND - NIGHT \nClose up on the M.C. \nPETE (MC) Ladies and Gentlemen. The bride and groom are about to leave. Please join me outside to send them off in style. \nEXT. HOTEL STEPS - NIGHT \nHarvey and Kate join the rest of the congregation outside on the steps of the hotel. Harvey looks on as his daughter and son-in-law head to an awaiting car. Susan stops and throws the bouquet behind her. It is caught by Aunt Maddie, who in turn throws it and it is caught by Harvey's `all grown up' niece. She blushes profusely revealing an impressive set of braces on her teenage teeth. \nSusan kisses her mother and Brian goodbye. And is about to get into the car when she stops and hurries over to Harvey. \nSUSAN Bye Dad. \nHARVEY Bye Suz... Bye Susan. \nShe hugs him tightly. Pulling away she turns to Kate. \nSUSAN Be gentle with him. \nKate nods as Susan turns to leave. \nHARVEY (to Kate) Sorry. \nKate smiles. As the car pulls away, everyone   cheers. Harvey looks on. His eyes momentarily lock onto his   ex-wife's. They share a conciliatory look. As Harvey watches   his daughter's car disappear down the street, Kate looks at   him. He turns back. Beat. \nKATE You Ok? \nHARVEY Yes. Yes, I am. \nBeat. Harvey looks around. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) You wanna get out of here? \nKATE Sure. \nEXT. MEWS STREET - NIGHT/DAWN \nHarvey and Kate walk. The streets are quiet. There is already a hint of dawn in the sky. Rubbish trucks manoeuvre. \nEXT. SOMMERSET HOUSE - DAWN \nThey turn into the courtyard of Sommerset House and take a seat on some chairs. The sky lightens. \nAggie tuts and calls behind her. \nAGGIE There's a man here looking for Kate, says he's `more than a friend.' \nOONAGH (O.S.) More than a friend?! \nOonagh comes out from the office, eyeing Harvey suspiciously. \nOONAGH (CONT'D) You're the American. (long beat) She likes you. I can tell.

WATERLOO BRIDGE - DAY \nHarvey hurries towards the Southbank. \nEXT. SOUTHBANK - DAY \nKate comes down from the upper terrace of the National, saying her good-byes to her classmates.

She momentarily falters before approaching. \nKATE Hey. \nHARVEY Hey. \nKATE You're still here - still in London... \nHARVEY Yeah. (beat) Kate, I just wanted to apologise and explain... \nKATE No, you don't have to - explain - it's fine - \nHARVEY No, but I do - \nKATE I don't need to hear - it's fine, seriously. \nHARVEY But I want to...

The door closes. Beat. Harvey returns the phone to his ear. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Hello? \nNo answer. He sits down on the bed and pours some tea. Just then his phone rings again. He reaches for it, knocking the trolley and the tea onto himself. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Fuck! \nGrabbing a tea towel, he dabs his trousers. \nINT. PUB - NIGHT \nFrom a distance, across a crowded Friday night bar, we watch our gang chat. It seems to be going well. Laughter hangs in the air. \nEXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA cab pulls up in front of a posh looking restaurant. Harvey steps out, dressed in the same cream jacket, but now sporting a pair of dark trousers. He looks like a bad lounge act. The cab pulls away as Harvey turns towards the restaurant. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nHarvey enters. Three young men stand to one side, chatting animatedly. On seeing Harvey, one of them looks up. \nSCOTT Harvey. \nHARVEY Scott. \nSCOTT You made it. \nHARVEY Yes. \nScott turns to his friends. \nSCOTT This is Susan's father, Harvey. Harvey Shine.

But Matt says he's very mature. \nKATE Oh right.

She gives it to Harvey. \nKATE (stepping backwards) I must go. \nShe turns and leaves, hurrying to catch a bus. \nHarvey stands holding an old library card. He looks down. On it is a faded photo of toothy young girl, no older than eleven. Harvey looks up and smiles. \nINT. BUS - EARLY MORNING \nKate takes a seat on the top deck of a bus.

STAIRWELL - MORNING \nHarvey, a man, seemingly impatient to start a `new life', runs up the steps. Surprised at first by his agility, he begins to slow. He stops to catch his breath. Suddenly his spare hand holds tight onto the bannister. Unsteady Harvey sits down. Close up on Harvey's face, confused. He tries to stand but again is forced back down. He begins to place his coffee on the stair next to him, but suddenly shudders, grabbing his shoulder. The coffee topples, spilling down the steps. \nHARVEY Shit. \nFrightened and confused, Harvey sits alone in the stairwell. \nJust then, a door opens and the African porter from before, comes through, carrying a tray. He sees Harvey. \nPORTER Sir, are you Ok? \n", "test2_true": "EXT. LONDON STREET - MORNING \nKate, with a skip in her step, walks through the bustling mid- day streets of London.

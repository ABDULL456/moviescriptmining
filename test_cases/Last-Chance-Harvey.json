{"test1_input": "Harvey wedges a fiver into his free hand as he retreats rapidly. The door closes. Beat. Harvey returns the phone to his ear. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Hello? \nNo answer. He sits down on the bed and pours some tea. Just then his phone rings again. He reaches for it, knocking the trolley and the tea onto himself. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Fuck! \nGrabbing a tea towel, he dabs his trousers. \nINT. PUB - NIGHT \nFrom a distance, across a crowded Friday night bar, we watch our gang chat. It seems to be going well. Laughter hangs in the air. \nEXT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nA cab pulls up in front of a posh looking restaurant. Harvey steps out, dressed in the same cream jacket, but now sporting a pair of dark trousers. He looks like a bad lounge act. The cab pulls away as Harvey turns towards the restaurant. \nINT. RESTAURANT - NIGHT \nHarvey enters. Three young men stand to one side, chatting animatedly. On seeing Harvey, one of them looks up. \nSCOTT Harvey. \nHARVEY Scott. \nSCOTT You made it. \nHARVEY Yes. \nScott turns to his friends. \nSCOTT This is Susan's father, Harvey. Harvey Shine. (beat) Harvey, this is my best man, Josh Stillman and Pete Turner. \nHARVEY Hi. \nFRIENDS Hi. \nSCOTT How are you Harvey? (glancing at Harvey's attire) Its great to see you. \nHARVEY Good thanks. Great. (sensing his gaze) How are you holding up? \nSCOTT Great. (turning to his friends) Can't wait to marry your daughter, really. \nLaughter. \nHARVEY No... (beat) Is she..? \nSCOTT She's through there. She'll be thrilled you're here. I'll go and find her. \nJust then Harvey's phone rings. \nHARVEY Sorry. \nHarvey turns away and answers. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Yes. (listens) No, no, that's not right. I booked Mike. It's important. I spoke to him about it two weeks ago. I booked him. (getting flustered) Have you told him its Harvey. It's really important... (suddenly conscious of Scott's friends standing nearby) Just...Just get him to call me, Ok? \nHarvey hangs up. And putting on his `positive' face turns back to Scott's friends. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Sorry. (beat) Always something. \nJOSH Sure. (beat) What's your field, Harvey? \nHARVEY Oh, I'm a...

(wanting to change subject) You guys work with Scott? \nPETE/JOSH Yes. \nHARVEY Oil, right? \nJOSH Futures, yes. \nHARVEY Well, I'm sure that's pretty profitable too. \nThe guys smile a little too readily. \nJOSH Sometimes, yes. \nHarvey tries to smile back. \nHARVEY Well, I'd better find my daughter. \nPETE Absolutely. Good to meet you, Harvey. See you in there. \nAs Harvey moves off into the adjacent room, the guys watch him go. \nINT. PUB / HALLWAY OUTSIDE BATHROOM - NIGHT \nKate and Oonagh wait in line for the bathroom. \nOONAGH So? \nKATE He seems nice. \nOONAGH Nice? Nice like good. Or nice like dull. \nKATE Nice like how old is he? \nOonagh smiles. \nOONAGH Old enough. Your age...ish. \nKATE He can't be, he's looks like a baby. \nOONAGH Alright, my age. But Matt says he's very mature. \nKATE Oh right. Did Matt offer that up - or was that in response to you two discussing my approaching barrenness. \nOONAGH Kate? \nJust then Kate's phone rings. \nOONAGH (CONT'D) Don't answer it. \nKATE I have to. She's on her own. (beat) She gets lonely. \nOONAGH Just tell her you're busy. \nKate nods and indicates that the loo is free. Oonagh goes in, as Kate answers her phone. \nKATE Mum? \nINT.

A small portfolio down in Florida. \nHARVEY Real Estate. That's great. (beat) That's really great. \nAwkward silence. \nBRIAN Well I think we should sit. I know Susan wanted us all seated before they joined us. \nHARVEY Sure. Good idea. \nEveryone begins to take their assigned seats. Harvey is on the inside close to the middle. It's a bit tight and involves people getting up to make way. Harvey gets to his seat and is just about to sit when his phone rings. Brian and Jean share a look. Taking it out of his pocket Harvey looks at the incoming number. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Sorry, I have to take this. (picks up) Can you hold a minute? \nHarvey makes his way back along the table, causing people to stand again. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Sorry. Sorry. \nHarvey walks away from the table. \nINT. PUB - NIGHT \nKate sits waiting. Simon has finally been served and turns from the bar with drinks in hand. As he does a young woman, standing with a small party of two other girls and a guy, greets him. Kate looks on. It's obvious from Simon's reaction that they know each other well. Just then Kate's phone rings again. She looks at the number and thinks about ignoring it, but in the end, reluctantly picks up. \nKATE Mum. You've got to stop calling. (beat) What? I can't hear. Hold on. \nKate gets up and moves towards the back-room. \nINT. RESTAURANT FOYER - NIGHT \nHarvey stands on the phone. \nHARVEY (getting more and more flustered) It'll take two hours max. No longer.

Everyone is seated. \nHARVEY Sorry... \nHe notices his name place has been moved to the end. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) (smiling/to Jean) Did you move me darling? \nJEAN No, Harvey. I didn't touch it. \nSUSAN Dad. I moved you. I thought it might be easier in case you needed to get out. \nHARVEY Ok, sweetheart. \nHarvey takes the last remaining seat. Brian stands. \nBRIAN Shall we have a quick toast to get things going? (beat) I'm going to save my big speech for tomorrow. (laughter) Dear Susan and Dear Scott, I just want to take us all back to that wonderful holiday we all had in Rome together last year and wish you `Salute'! \nEVERYONE Salute! \nBRIAN Jean and I love you both so much. And we're so happy that Scott is going to part of our clan now. And so I say many, many, happy, happy years ahead. Salute! \nEVERYONE Salute! \n", "test2_true": "Everyone turns to Harvey as he stands to make a speech. Just then his phone rings on vibrate. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Sorry. \nHarvey scrambles to turn it off, as Jean rolls her eyes. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Sorry, I thought it was off. (flustered he finally manages to stop it buzzing) Um, uh. (beat) To Susan and Scott. A great couple. (beat) Cheers. \nMomentary awkward silence. \nEVERYONE Cheers. \nHarvey sits. \nSUSAN Let's eat. \nEVERYONE Yes... \nEveryone tucks in. Harvey sits slightly blushing at the end of the table, knowing he's blown it. \nINT. PUB - NIGHT \nKate hangs up and returns to the main room, to find that Simon has been joined at their table by the young group. Kate bolsters herself before returning to the table. \nKATE Hi. \nSIMON Hey. Kate. (beat) Sorry, i bumped into these guys and couldn't shake them. (turning to his friends) Everyone this is Kate. \nKate holds up her hand, before blushing a little. \nKATE Hi. \nSIMON Kate this is Andrew, Melissa, Gwen, and Elinor. \nEVERYONE Hi. \nKate sits down. \nMELISSA Sorry, I hope we're not barging in on your evening. \nKate shakes her head. \nMELISSA (CONT'D) It was Simon's idea. How do you guys know each other, anyway? \nKate glances at Simon. \nKATE We don't really. We just met. \nMelissa looks at Simon and grins. \nMELISSA A blind date? \nSIMON No. (beat) We met through friends. \nMELISSA I see. I think we should leave you guys alone. \nKATE (a little too abruptly) No. (beat) Don't. Stay. It's fine. \nSlightly awkward pause, broken by Andrew. \nANDREW Hey does anyone know the cricket score? \nSIMON England were all out by tea, when I last checked. \nANDREW Bloody hell. \nGWEN Cricket. Don't get it. \n", "test2_id": 2188, "test3_input": "Kate looks at Harvey sympathetically for a moment. \nKATE Not bad. (beat) But what can I do for you? (beat) Make it worse, maybe? \nHARVEY Let me make it up to you. (beat) Would you let me buy you lunch. What time is it - tea time? I'll buy you tea. \nKate blushes ever so slightly. \nKATE That's very sweet of you, but... I don't know you. And... you don't know me. \nHARVEY Exactly. That's why we should have lunch - tea. \nKate can't help but smile. Beat. \nKATE Thank you, but...no. \nShe indicates her book. \nHARVEY Because you've got your book. And it's a good replacement for humans. \nKate smiles and nods. Just then her phone rings. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) If that's for me I'm in the shower. \nKate smiles as she takes out her phone and looks at the incoming number. She is about to answer, when she stops herself. \nHARVEY (CONT'D) Aren't you going to answer that? \nShe thinks for a moment, before putting the phone back. \nKATE No. \nHARVEY Should I take that as a hopeful sign. \nKate can't help but smile. \nKATE If it is, you could just give me a little wider smile. \nKate can't help but smile wider. \nINT. LIVING ROOM - DAY \nKate's mum pulls the phone away from her ear, perplexed by the lack of response. Her eyes wander to the window. Drawing back the curtain, she looks out. POV: The Neighbour, now sporting a white apron, busies himself as usual. He suddenly bends down and heaves what would best be described as a body bag onto his shoulder. As he stumbles under the weight, he carries it into the shed. Kate's mum turns away ashen. \nINT. CHEZ GERARD - DAY \nHarvey and Kate remain seated at adjacent tables. Muzak plays in the background. They are now virtually the sole patrons of Chez Gerard. Kate eats a salad and reads her book. Just then, Harvey's food arrives.

She puts down her book. \nKATE (CONT'D) So why aren't you at the wedding? \nHarvey, momentarily taken aback by the directness of Kate's question, is about to answer, when the sound of a vacuum cleaner erupts. Harvey and Kate look over to see a cleaner vacuuming the floor nearby. \nHARVEY Ah, that's better. I knew something was missing. (shouting over the din) I had to get back for a work thing. \nKATE (over the din) A work thing. For the job you just lost? \nBeat. \nHARVEY (over din) Yes. \n", "test3_true": "HARVEY (over din) Yes.

Uh...Uh... (long beat) Well, maybe, I mean it maybe before your time. \nKATE (smiles) No, go on. \nHarvey smiles a little sheepishly. \nHARVEY (singsong voice) You can take the Salem out of the country - but you can't take the country out of Salem. \nBeat. \nKATE No. \nHARVEY It's a cigarette. \nKATE Oh really? \nHARVEY Forget it. \nKATE Ok. \nThe vacuuming starts up again.

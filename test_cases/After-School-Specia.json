NAOMI Yeah. Thanks. I'm so embarrassed. She pats at the stain. DEACON (genuine) Really? I didn't think you got embarrassed about anything.

ASHLEY If you guys want to do gay porn, you still have to pay me. DEACON Hang on. Relax. It was just this stupid dream I had. MATT You dreamed about making out with Fred? DEACON No. Well, yes. And we were both having sex with you. But it was just a dream so let's forget it. Everyone is a little uneasy at this admission. Deacon quickly changes the subject.

ON FRED and DEACON, away from the action. FRED (snide; whispers) How's Naomi? DEACON Fine. COOP (O.S.) Not yet. This is the really scary part. DEACON (whispers) Hey. Can I ask you a question? Fred shrugs. The memory of the nightmare is wreaking havoc with Deacon's conscience. DEACON (CONT'D) Do you ever think maybe we've gotten ourselves in a little over our heads with all of this? COOP (O.S.) Oh, baby. Not yet. Fred appears to be pondering the question deeply. His face slowly contorts to a look of seeming anguish. Then, FRED Fire!

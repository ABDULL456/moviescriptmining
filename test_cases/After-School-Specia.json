{"train": "AFTER SCHOOL SPECIAL \nwritten by \nDavid H. Steinberg \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT December 21, 2001 \nFADE IN: 1    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                    1 As we wind down the crowded hallway in this typical American high school... 1A   ANOTHER CORRIDOR                                                1A ...we hear all the sounds of a STANDARD PORNO FLICK, from the unenthusiastic screams of fake ecstasy to the cheesy music. 1B   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - AUDITORIUM - DAY                1B The sounds echo in the empty hall. Behind the stage a light from an open door... MATT (O.S.) This is unwatchable. It's not even in focus. And geez, look, the boom mike is in the shot. This is really shoddy work. 1C   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM   - DAY                1C The door leads into this room, as we continue on to a TV MONITOR displaying a sweaty guy's ugly face. DEACON (O.S.) Why do they always show the guy's face? It's like, can't we just assume he's enjoying it? We slowly PULL BACK from the TV. FRED (O.S.) Because they're trying to make us feel like we're better looking than that guy, so we should be able to get chicks as hot as her. DEACON (O.S.) How the hell do you know? FRED (O.S.) It's a basic rule of porno. Finally, we REVEAL our three heroes: MATT, FRED, and DEACON. They're watching the porno... 2    INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - A/V ROOM - DAY                   2 ... before school with the sound turned way down, but you can still hear the porno. The three guys are sitting with their book bags on their laps to conceal any possible bonerage. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        2. \n11   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                   11 Deacon talks quietly to a DORKY FRESHMAN. DEACON Dirty Darla #7 is a modern classic. This is grade-A porn, my friend. Worth a lot more than twenty dollars. DORKY FRESHMAN Sweet. He hands him the money and Deacon makes the exchange for the tape. The freshman clutches it like gold and scurries away. Deacon heads out down the hallway towards his locker. He sees a gaggle of teenage GIRLS gossiping. DEACON (V.O.) People always talk about how tough it is being a teenage girl. I mean, if I have to watch one more TV movie about bulimia or self mutilation or vaginal dryness... Deacon reaches his locker and opens it. He sees some CHEERLEADERS bouncing down the hallway. Deacon takes out some books for class. DEACON (CONT'D; V.O.) (CONT'D) I'll tell you what's really hard. Being a seventeen year old boy. Imagine what it's like to have only one thing on your mind all day, every day, but to have absolutely no way of getting it. 12   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY                                        12 CLOSE ON a textbook showing the anatomy of the vagina. PULL BACK to reveal Deacon, seemingly staring into space, but really staring at... DEACON (V.O.) Testosterone is a drug more powerful than heroin. I don't really have any evidence to support that, but the point is, a horny teenage boy will do almost anything for even a glimpse of sex. ... his BIOLOGY TEACHER's erect NIPPLES visible through her conservative bra and blouse. Aside from her flashing headlights, she's the kind of woman you wouldn't notice even if you were alone with her on a two-man luge. But that doesn't matter-- Deacon can't take his eyes off of them. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     6. \nBIOLOGY TEACHER (in the background) ... the increase in the hormone testosterone causes certain physiological changes in the adolescent male... DEACON (V.O.) We're suffering. Suffering from a deep, debilitating addiction to something we've never even had. Teenage boys are like time bombs, ready to explode. BEHIND DEACON Two GUYS are whispering. GUY 1 Did you hear about Rachael? GUY 2 No, what happened? GUY 1 John Baldwin nailed her. Deacon bolts upright and spins around, concerned. DEACON Are you talking about Rachael Unger? GUY 1 Yeah. It was at Richard Rosenblatt's party. In the bathroom. DEACON (crushed) You're kidding. 13   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - DAY (FLASHBACK)                        13 RACHAEL UNGER, Deacon's girlfriend at the time, is naked under Deacon's sheets after school one day. Deacon ENTERS from the bathroom and is immediately surprised by her state of undress. DEACON Rachael! What are you doing? She sits up and strikes a sexy pose. RACHAEL We've been together for a year now, and I thought it was time to take our relationship to the next level. Deacon is becoming very nervous. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                      7. \nDEACON Now? RACHAEL You've been talking about this for months. DEACON I didn't think you were listening to me. Suddenly, Rachael becomes a little self-conscious. RACHAEL Don't you want to? DEACON Of course I do. But, I, um... I don't have anything... She pulls out a condom. RACHAEL I do. But he's still hesitating. RACHAEL (CONT'D) Deacon, what's the problem? Deacon looks at her waiting there for him, his for the taking. An eternity passes. Then, DEACON I have a math test tomorrow. 14   INT. BIOLOGY CLASS - DAY (END FLASHBACK)                        14 The Teacher CLEARS HER THROAT and Deacon snaps out of it. He turns away from the guys behind him as they continue to describe the John Baldwin incident. DEACON (V.O.) \"I have a math test tomorrow.\" The bottom line is, I just couldn't do it. I don't know why, I just couldn't. And I've cursed myself every day since then. Deacon is suddenly... 15   INT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - HALLWAY - DAY                   15 ... very depressed as he trudges to his locker. Which is nothing compared to how he feels when he looks \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     8. \nRUSS Gotcha! Fred SCREAMS. RUSS (CONT'D) I've been watching you. Russ grabs Fred by the shoulders and throws him up against the shelf, shaking him with every word. RUSS (CONT'D) Those movies aren't for little monkey- boys! FRED Aaaaaahhhhhhhh! The Customers stop to stare at the scene. Fred breaks free, and Russ chases after him. RUSS Come back here, you bastard! Russ runs after him and DIVES at Fred's legs, knocking him and entire shelf of tapes over. The tape FLY EVERYWHERE. Fred is still SCREAMING. Russ starts shouting at Fred so that everyone can hear. A crowd gathers around to watch the spectacle. RUSS (CONT'D) What else you got in here? Russ rips open Fred's bag and pulls out items, looking for more tapes. Fred tries to stop him, but the old man has an iron grip and keeps him away. Fred cringes as Russ exposes porno magazines, kleenex tissues, baby wipes, the bottle of Moisty-Mate Firming Lotion, Q-tips, women's sexy underwear, surgical gloves... Wendy and Kelly are completely grossed out. RUSS (CONT'D) (totally confused) What's this for? ...and a Barbie-type DOLL with a pullstring. Russ pulls it. DOLL I'm Candy. Let's play dress-up. The crowd is now seriously disturbed. MARK Dude. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        12. \nFred sits there, whimpering on the ground. 19   EXT. SUBURBAN STREET - DAY                                         19 Deacon drives the DMV Tester Car under the watchful eye of the DMV TESTER. DEACON And I signal exactly two hundred feet before the turn. Rule 108-1. The unimpressed Tester remains expressionless. DMV TESTER Great. Now after the right, I want you to parallel park in the open space. Deacon complies. DEACON I begin the parallel parking maneuver by pulling within three feet of the forward vehicle. I now shift into reverse while turning the wheel two revolutions clockwise... The Tester rubs his brow. 20   INT. DMV - DAY                                                     20 FLASH! Deacon's picture is taken. He passed. \n21   OMITTED                                                            21 22   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - DAY                                          22 It's dark, but suddenly the lights come on. EVERYONE Surprise! Deacon pretends to be surprised. DEACON Wow. This is great. The room is sparsely populated with a few of Deacon's RELATIVES, his MOM and DAD, younger brother MAX (14), and ROGER, a wheelchair-bound nerd with a face full of orthodontic headgear and braces. MATT Were you surprised? \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                       13. \nDEACON Yeah. MATT Really? DEACON Really. I was. ROGER Happy birthday, Deacon. It's Lois Lane #2. Be careful. It's still in the wrapper. He hands Deacon a comic book, still in the plastic bag. DEACON Thanks. 23   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - LATER                                       23 Half-eaten cake and ice cream, unwrapped presents. Matt videotapes the event. MR. LEWIS Are you ready for the big present? DEACON (laying it on thick) You mean there's more? Deacon can hardly contain his excitement. MR. LEWIS It's in the garage. Come with us. He follows them, looking back knowingly at Fred and Matt. 24   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - GARAGE - DAY (CONTINUOUS)                   24 The door opens, the lights come on, and Deacon's face drops. No new car. Instead, several large wrapped boxes. Deacon halfheartedly rips open the paper. MR. LEWIS It's a new computer system. You've been talking about it for months. But his Mom can see his expression. MRS. LEWIS What? That's not what you wanted? DEACON No, it is. It's just-- \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                       17. \nDEACON (in a trance) Oh, my God. There's Naomi. FRED She looks good. And there's NAOMI, every teenage boy's fantasy, wearing a hot party dress and drinking a cup of beer. Someone lightly bumps her... CLOSE ON her lips as the beer dribbles down her chin, and the world goes still . She playfully wipes the beer off her moistened lips and chin with the back of her hand. She turns her head and her hair floats in the air. DEACON AND FRED are zombies, completely mesmerized by her. FRED She spilled her beer. DEACON Yeah. Fred adjusts his pants. Deacon makes a decision. One that he'd normally never make. DEACON (CONT'D) I'm gonna go talk to her. What have I got to lose? FRED Your dignity? DEACON She's Rachael's friend. It's not like I don't know her. MATT Ask her if she has any unusual hats. Girls like that. Deacon gives Matt a dirty look. THE KEG AREA DEACON Hey, Naomi. NAOMI Happy Birthday, Deacon. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                       18. \nDEACON (pleasantly surprised) You remembered. NAOMI Well, I got this flyer and-- DEACON Oh, right. So where's Jake? NAOMI Like I care. DEACON (hopeful) So you two aren't going out any more? NAOMI Duh. Deacon's mind is racing with possibilities when: JAKE (O.S.) Freakin! It's Jake, back for another beer. JAKE (CONT'D) Hey, did you hear about Rachael Unger? Before Deacon can answer... JAKE (CONT'D) He shoots, he misses, right, ass- sphincter? Come on, Naomi. We're going in the pool. NAOMI Screw off. I'm talking to Deacon. JAKE Whatever. NAOMI Whatever. Jake gives Deacon a dirty look, nods a \"let's go\" to J.T. and Mark, and heads out back. NAOMI (CONT'D) What an asshole. As soon as Jake is out of sight, Deacon turns back to Naomi, but she's already gone, stranding Deacon. What just happened here? REVEAL Matt helping Roger drink a beer in the background. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        19. \n28   EXT. COOP'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - LATER                              28 Deacon wanders out back. It's   very dark and there are several people in the pool, including   Jake's good-looking friends, Kelly, Wendy, J.T., and MARK.   It's hard to tell in the dark water, but it looks like they   might not be wearing any clothes. Deacon sees this and   starts to walk away. J.T. Deacon. I heard it was your birthday. Come on in the pool, man. DEACON No, that's okay. MARK No, seriously. It's cool. KELLY (come hither) Come on, Deacon. WENDY Yeah. Come on. Deacon thinks about it. He takes the metaphorical plunge. DEACON All right. He slips off his shoes and takes off his shirt. He walks over to the shallow end. Deacon steps in with his shorts still on. MARK Dude, what are you doing? Take off your clothes. DEACON What? WENDY We're skinny dipping, Deacon. He hesitates, not sure what to do. DEACON Oh. Okay. Sorry, I'll just leave you guys alone then-- KELLY --No, come on in. Join us. Wendy swims into J.T.'s arms. Her shoulders rise above the water and you can just make out the top of her breast. \nDORKY FRESHMAN Is this some kind of extortion racket? I'll pay you double if you can get me something today. DEACON I'm sorry. There's nothing we can do for a while. We don't have anything new. DORKY FRESHMAN I'm dying. I just need something. Just then, Naomi walks by on her way to the parking lot. DEACON Hey, Naomi. What are you up to? NAOMI Going home to cram for midterms. With a look, Deacon shoos away the freshman dork. DEACON Oh. I could help you. I mean, if you needed any help. NAOMI That's okay. I'll be all right. Deacon searches for something meaningful to say, desperate not to let the moment pass him by. Naomi cuts him some slack by asking, NAOMI (CONT'D) So where did Rachael go off to? DEACON She went to Paris with the French Club. (then, taking a chance) We're seeing other people. She laughs at his attempt at being nonchalant. But she's laughing with him, not at him, and Deacon can tell the difference. He relaxes... JAKE (O.S.) Hey, sphincter. ... just as Jake drives up to them. Deacon is starting to really get pissed at Jake ruining the moment with Naomi. DEACON Look, can you please stop calling me that? I think we're old enough to just let it go. All right? \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     24. \nJAKE Oh, sure. Sorry about that... Shit-pants. He looks at Naomi. JAKE (CONT'D) Hi, Naomi. NAOMI Whatever. She turns her back to Jake and his smile fades. He revs the engine and peels out BACKWARDS. Deacon jumps out of the way, but his bike is CRUSHED by the car. JAKE Oops. Sorry. He shifts gears and drives over the bike again. He laughs as he drives away. Naomi gives Deacon a pitying look and walks away. The moment is gone. Now Deacon is... 33   INT. AEROSTAR - DAY                                             33 ... pissed. His crushed bike is in the back seat. DEACON (emphatic) Look, mom. I need a car. MRS. LEWIS But I thought we agreed-- DEACON I need a car of my own. MRS. LEWIS Well, honey. A car is a lot of responsibility. DEACON Jesus, Mom. I'm seventeen now. I think I can handle it. MRS. LEWIS Well, it's also a lot of money. I'll tell you what. Maybe you can get an after school job to earn money for a car. I'll talk to your father. Deacon is stewing. \n34   OMITTED                                                         34 \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                      25. \n35   INT.

MATT Your dad really knows his firewalls. Deacon bursts into the room. FRED Hey, asshole. Don't just come barging in here. We could have been naked. Matt gives Fred a look. DEACON (excited) Shut up. I figured out how to get back on the Tony Montana track.... So, I'm at the zoo today... 36   EXT. ZOO - DAY                                                   36 A crowd of people (including Deacon's biology class) are watching something in the monkey cage. BIOLOGY TEACHER People! People! Come quickly. Witness the miracle of nature at its most primal. She's videotaping it, and Deacon looks up AT HER VIDEO VIEWFINDER. It's a monkey orgy. Masturbation and fornication everywhere. DEACON (V.O.) And these monkeys are doing it. I mean, they're going wild. And Miss Ariel is videotaping it. \nFRED Okay. Sure. I've thought about it. I've thought about shaving Principal Taggert's ass, too. A look, then Deacon gets up to seal the deal. DEACON Look. This is an opportunity we shouldn't let slip away. If we make this movie, it could be the best year of our lives. We'll go in boys and come out men. And at the end, we'll have the money, the power, and the women. But you losers would rather play it safe. Well, I'm not going to waste another minute. I'm making this porno movie with or without you. And when I show up at school in my new set of wheels, and you two limp dicks are begging me for my sloppy seconds, I'll just have to tell you, \"Sorry, guys. That ship has sailed. You blew it.\" Ringing silence. MATT (sincerely) That was a really good speech, Deacon. DEACON Thanks. MATT Did you work that out before? DEACON No, Matt. FRED Okay... So say we were to do this. What would we call our company? MATT I've got it. \"After School Special.\" They look at him. It's perfect. 38   INT. OFFICE BUILDING - DAY                                      38 WE FOLLOW a WOMAN dressed in a Fredericks of Hollywood type outfit, walking down the hallway past office suites; a mortgage company, a dentist, etc... She enters an office. As the door closes behind her, WE SEE the sign on the door, \"Ramalot Productions.\" \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     30. \n39   INT.

Blow-ups of the company's box covers on the walls, hundreds of copies of titles on shelves, a small STAFF and two adjoining rooms. VIC RAMALOT, whose face we recognize from Dirty Darla #7, enters from the set. His partner, MIKE, helps him on with his robe. MIKE That was good. Some good action. VIC I've got a question for you Mike, and I want you to promise to be completely honest. MIKE Sure. Of course, Vic. Vic looks at him, vulnerable. VIC Do you think I'm too fat? MIKE Are you kidding? The camera loves you. VIC Seriously? MIKE Absolutely. VIC Thanks, man. Vic gives Mike a jive hand shake and the two do a little hug. Over Mike's shoulder, Vic sees the woman who's come into the office. VIC (CONT'D) Darla, sweetheart. Ready for number eight? Darla drops her top and heads for the bathroom. DARLA Sure, Vic, lemme freshen up first. VIC (to Mike) Is he in there? Mike nods, leading Vic through a door, into \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        31. \n40   INT.

Vic shakes his head, picking up a pair of rusty hedge clippers from the table. He snaps them open. VIC So, you think you can just walk into my town and move in on my territory? The Man takes a quick look down at his own crotch, fearing the worst. He shakes his head, pleading through his gag. 41   INT. DOCTOR'S OFFICE - DAY                                         41 The guys are huddled behind the frosted window of Fred's dad's office, standing away from the RECEPTIONIST. FRED We've got to have two forms of i.d. to prove she's over eighteen. DEACON How much money do we need? FRED A first time porno actress makes only two fifty to five hundred bucks. MATT That's it? Does that include the sex? DEACON Yes, Matt. MATT So how do we get women for this movie? FRED We place an ad in the Cleveland X-Press for \"body models.\" That's like some sort of code word in the industry. MATT Are we supposed to have sex with these women? DEACON No, Matt. A NURSE walks in. NURSE Fred, your father wants you to take these urine samples down to the lab. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     32. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     42. \nThe song ends, the curtain comes up, and Fred is smiling ear to ear.

You guys are filmmakers? MATT Video actually. They won't let me shoot on film. Deacon pulls out his wad of cash. DEACON Look. We're paying top dollar, hetero only, no anal, and we're distributing through our web site. ASHLEY Aren't you kind of young? DEACON Aren't you? You know we're going to need two forms of i.d. to prove you're over eighteen. ASHLEY I'm eighteen. Don't worry. FRED Then you're hired. MATT Shouldn't we audition her first? ASHLEY Don't worry.

FRED'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                      57 Fred and Matt are huddled around the computer. FRED Oh, I've got it. What if the Math Team Captain is in detention for something... MATT For fixing grades for a girl... FRED Yeah, and the cheerleader is in there and she's going to get grounded if she fails one more test... As they talk, Fred types away. 58    EXT.

Deacon steps away from his class for a moment. DEACON Matt, what's wrong? BIOLOGY TEACHER (O.S.) Like all mammals, the whale gives birth to live young. Can anyone name another characteristic of mammals? Vinnie? FRED Our site got linked by another bigger site. Someone must have seen our stories and liked them. DEACON And? MATT We got a few more pre-orders and a ton of hits. DEACON How many? MATT Guess. DEACON A thousand? FRED Twelve thousand. DEACON Holy shit! Deacon high-fives the other two. They're all stoked. FRED We need to hurry up and make this movie. MATT We should go over the schedule for tomorrow. And make sure the script is ready. Deacon's smile fades. DEACON Uh, I can't tonight guys. FRED Why? Where are you going? \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                    60. \nDEACON It's this thing I have to go to. MATT Is it a travelling carnival? DEACON No. Look, it's this party Naomi invited me to. MATT Can we come? Fred picks up on Deacon's hesitation. This isn't good. DEACON Uh... Okay. I guess that's cool. An awkward beat. DEACON (CONT'D) I want you guys to come. It's just, I don't know. I kind of had this vibe from Naomi. MATT (still doesn't get it) We can just meet you there. DEACON Yeah. Okay. That's cool. Look, it's at Mark and J.T. Slistak's house. I'll see you guys there. I've got to get back to class. MATT Later. Deacon walks back to the group. MATT (CONT'D) What are you wearing to the party? FRED We're not really going to the party, you moron. MATT Why not? FRED Because I said so. Matt starts getting agitated. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                      61. \nMATT But we told Deacon-- I mean, we can't just not show up. What if Deacon is looking for us-- This is too complicated to explain to Matt, so Fred just gives in. FRED All right. All right. Stop crying already. We'll make an appearance. MATT Cool. 66   INT. MARK'S HOUSE - NIGHT                                        66 Amid this raging party, Deacon has taken his rightful place with the in-crowd, standing dangerously close to Naomi without his usual sidekicks weighing him down. Finally. NAOMI You know, Rachael's coming back from Paris in a couple of weeks. DEACON So? NAOMI So, aren't you even a little interested in seeing her? DEACON No. There's someone else I'd rather see... He looks into her eyes, waiting to see if the limb he's out on is going to break. She smiles. It's working. Just then, MATT Hey, guys. It's his sidekicks and they've got some seriously bad timing. Deacon shoots them an annoyed look. NAOMI So what's this project you guys are working on? FRED We can't really talk about it. JAKE (O.S.) Yeah. It's private. Jake eyes Deacon intently. \nMATT Hey, quit the chatter. FRED Sorry. MATT Hey, why don't you guys kiss? DEACON What? MATT You know. Make out with each other. DEACON What? FRED All right. Fred goes in to kiss Deacon, who's thoroughly confused. Deacon holds him back with his hand. DEACON Wait. Why do you want us to kiss? MATT (O.S.) Because that's what guys do in gay porn. DEACON What? Deacon looks over at the camera. It's Ashley filming. PANIC! He slowly looks down at the person he and Fred are having sex with. He can barely look. It's Matt! MATT More sausage please. DEACON Aaaaaaaaaaahhhhhhhhh! CUT TO: 69   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   69 Deacon bolts up out of bed. Nightmare. Thank God. 70   INT. BASEMENT SET AS \"MOVIE THEATER\" - DAY                      70 Deacon enters and the scene looks very much like the dream: Ashley on the bed and Matt and Fred waiting around. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     66. \nThe set is made up to look like a movie theater, complete with rows of seats, a bed sheet \"screen,\" and a massive 5,000 watt light. Deacon is still a little agitated. DEACON Where the hell is Coop? There's no way I'm making out with Fred. Then Coop comes out of the bathroom and sees everyone staring at Deacon. COOP What's going on? ASHLEY Deacon is talking about making out with Fred. FRED No way. I'm holding the mike and that's it. COOP I thought we were doing straight porn. ASHLEY If you guys want to do gay porn, you still have to pay me. DEACON Hang on. Relax. It was just this stupid dream I had. MATT You dreamed about making out with Fred? DEACON No. Well, yes. And we were both having sex with you. But it was just a dream so let's forget it. Everyone is a little uneasy at this admission. Deacon quickly changes the subject. DEACON (CONT'D) What's with the light? MATT It's a \"special effect.\" If you want this film to look amateurish, you're going to have to get someone else to do it. DEACON Okay. Relax. FRED Come on. Let's do it already. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        67. \nMATT Action. Matt starts his cheesy \"projector light effect\" and Coop takes a seat next to Ashley. ASHLEY This summer tent-pole event-movie is making me so scared. COOP Hide your head down here and I'll tell you when it's safe to come up. As she starts to go down, we turn our attention... ON FRED and DEACON, away from the action. FRED (snide; whispers) How's Naomi? DEACON Fine. COOP (O.S.) Not yet. This is the really scary part. DEACON (whispers) Hey. Can I ask you a question? Fred shrugs. The memory of the nightmare is wreaking havoc with Deacon's conscience. DEACON (CONT'D) Do you ever think maybe we've gotten ourselves in a little over our heads with all of this? COOP (O.S.) Oh, baby. Not yet. Fred appears to be pondering the question deeply. His face slowly contorts to a look of seeming anguish. Then, FRED Fire! The coiled cord to the massive light is burning a circular hole in the smouldering carpet. COOP Unplug the light! Deacon moves to unplug it. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        68. \nDEACON I think Ashley's busy tonight-- ASHLEY Okay. Oh, shit. MRS. LEWIS Okay, then. 74   INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                           74 Ashley is eating dinner with the Lewises. Max keeps staring at her. Mr. Lewis steals a few glances of Ashley himself while continuing his work-related rant. MR. LEWIS So get this. Johnson comes up to me today and he's all like \"where's the ND-90's?\" I'm like, \"Johnson, they discontinued the ND-90 like six weeks ago.\" I've been telling this guy... ASHLEY Johnson sounds like a moron. MR. LEWIS Exactly! Mr. Lewis is psyched that someone is finally paying attention to him. Mrs. Lewis doesn't like the way he's looking at her. MRS. LEWIS So, Ashley. If I could ask you a personal question, exactly how old are you? ASHLEY Nineteen. But I tell people eighteen. Deacon laughs nervously. DEACON Isn't that funny? The doorbell rings. DEACON (CONT'D) I'll get it. FOYER Deacon open the door. It's Naomi. DEACON What are you doing here? \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     72. \nNAOMI I thought I'd come by and surprise you. Maybe we could hang out in your bedroom. She looks at him seductively. Deacon looks over his shoulder. DEACON Now's not a good time. NAOMI What's wrong? DEACON Nothing. Let's talk later. He tries to close the door, but she stops it. MRS. LEWIS (O.S.) Deacon, who is it? Too late. Naomi comes in. NAOMI Hi, Mrs. Lewis. I'm Naomi. I'm Deacon's girlfriend. And with that she looks at Deacon, figuring she just made his day. It fails, however, to achieve the desired effect. MRS. LEWIS His girlfriend? She looks at Deacon. Max pokes his head through. MAX Deacon has two girlfriends? DEACON Shut up, Max! NAOMI What do you mean? What's going on? MAX Deacon's other girlfriend is having dinner with us. DEACON I can explain. Naomi walks into the kitchen with Max. MAX This is Deacon's other girlfriend, Ashley. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     73. \nMR. LEWIS His other girlfriend? Dad's beaming with pride. The two girls size each other up. ASHLEY Hi. NAOMI Oh, my God. How old are you, you slut? ASHLEY Eighteen. NAOMI I thought you were a nice guy. Naomi storms out of the house. Deacon follows, then Ashley. MRS. LEWIS You need to have a talk with him. He could be having S-E-X. MR. LEWIS I need to give him a goddamn medal. (she storms off) What? FOYER Deacon watches Naomi go. Ashley consoles him. ASHLEY Let her go. DEACON Are you insane? I've been fantasizing about Naomi Feldman since the seventh grade. ASHLEY Fantasy and reality are two different things, Deacon. Don't fall in love with who you think she is. You have to be sure you love the real person. DEACON So what should I do? ASHLEY Go after her then. Or don't. Whatever. He looks at Ashley for a beat, then goes after Naomi. 75   EXT. STREET - NIGHT                                             75 Naomi and Deacon are arguing under a street light. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        74. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                       78. \nFred exchanges a glance with Matt. DEACON (CONT'D) And I wanted her to help out. Give the script a female point of view. Fred pulls Deacon aside. FRED Jesus, Deacon. Didn't you see that Beatles documentary on the History Channel? You're pulling a Yoko Ono on us. DEACON What? FRED Fine. Whatever. Let's get started. I'm sure she'll be really helpful. Coop comes out of the bathroom dressed as the Math Team Captain, complete with nerd glasses, pocket protector, etc. COOP Oh, hey, Naomi. NAOMI Hey, Coop. Are you helping these guys, too? COOP (sheepishly) Sort of. MATT Okay, people. Places everybody. Let's try to do this with a little heart, okay? And action. Everyone turns to their scripts and starts the rehearsal. ASHLEY This quadratic equation is so hard. COOP Well, maybe we should just stick to long division. Coop drops his corduroys and Naomi gasps. She stares at Coop's \"slide rule\" for a beat, then snaps out of it. NAOMI Wait a second. Cut. This is all wrong. She wouldn't be fantasizing about some geek. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     79. \nMATT He's not a geek. He's the Math Team Captain. NAOMI No, he should be really well-dressed, and maybe he's a foreign exchange student from Portugal. MATT Um, and the director is the only one who's allowed to say \"cut.\" FRED Who cares, Naomi? NAOMI Deacon agrees with me, don't you? Matt and Fred look at Deacon. COOP Dudes, come on. My nuts are getting cold. ASHLEY I'm out of here. NAOMI Shut up, Coop. This is important. COOP (swings his arms out) And my nuts aren't? Coop's hand accidentally smacks Ashley in the nose as she's getting up. She SCREAMS. DEACON Are you okay? COOP I'm sorry, Ashley. She's pissed, holding her nose. ASHLEY Look. This is ridiculous. Who does dress rehearsals for a porno shoot? MATT Oh, sure. Why don't we throw out the script while we're at it and \"improvise.\" \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     80. \nASHLEY Guys, I appreciate the money. It's nice to get paid for sitting around doing nothing, but this isn't helping my career. I've got no footage for my reel. She packs up. FRED Where are you going? ASHLEY Sorry. She leaves. COOP Ashley, wait. I'm sorry. Ashley! Then, he blurts out something unexpected: COOP (CONT'D) (calling after her) I love you! Coop exchanges an awkward glance with the guys: he's said too much. He goes after Ashley, with his pants still around his ankles and his bare ass in full display. He stumbles on his pants and falls on his face. He gets up quickly and continues after her, still with his pants down. FRED Now what are we going to do? Your \"girlfriend\" ruined everything. DEACON Coop's the one that smacked her. NAOMI Besides, if you losers knew anything about women, we wouldn't have this problem. FRED Who asked you? NAOMI I don't have to take this. She storms off, leaving Deacon there to make a decision. He looks at Matt and Fred for a beat, then follows Naomi. Fred and Matt are crushed. 80   EXT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - DAY                                80 Ashley is walking through the parking lot on the way to work. \nNaomi's HAND presses up against the window. It slowly falls to the ground. FRED (V.O.) It's a basic rule of porno. JUMP CUT TO: Back on the bed, Naomi is in a state of complete bliss, having had her first ever orgasm. ASHLEY (V.O.) Fantasy and reality are two different things... But Deacon doesn't share Naomi's contentment. He looks troubled. 83A   INT. THE PRETTY KITTY CLUB - BACKSTAGE - NIGHT                     83A The next night, Deacon is talking to Ashley backstage as she's getting ready to go on. DEACON I don't know. It was weird. Is it supposed to be so weird? ASHLEY Of course it was weird. True love can only exist between two women. Deacon is stunned. ASHLEY (CONT'D) Just kidding. I don't know, Deacon. Do you like this girl? He hesitates a bit too long. DEACON Of course I do. ASHLEY Your heart is telling you that you don't. And I think it's time you start listening to your heart. Deacon still doesn't get it. ASHLEY (CONT'D) Look. I have to go on. Just do whatever you want. Or don't. Whatever. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        85. \n84   INT.

DAVE (cameo for the director, DME) comes to the counter with a box. VIC Thanks, Dave. DAVE Vic. He turns to leave just as another GUY (cameo for the writer, DHS) comes up to Dave with a pad of paper. VIDEO DUPE GUY Hey, Dave, there's a guy on the phone who wants to set up a new account. DAVE What's it for? VIDEO DUPE GUY Some outfit called After School Special. They turn back. MIKE What did you just say? VIDEO DUPE GUY Nothing. It's for another customer. Mike grabs him by the collar and pulls him over to Vic. VIC Did you say \"After School Special\"? Mike grabs the paper, drops the guy, and he and Vic rush out of the store. After they're gone: VIDEO DUPE GUY Shit, man. You must be crazy. (calling after them) Better watch your back, homie! You might get smoked! 85   INT.

DEACON What are we doing here? \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     86. \nNAOMI What? I thought you might want some new clothes. DEACON I don't need any new clothes. NAOMI And guess what? I booked facials for us at the Serenity Spa. DEACON Naomi. Wait. Stop. He stops her. NAOMI What's wrong? DEACON I have to meet up with Matt and Fred this afternoon. I already blew them off yesterday. NAOMI Deacon, you don't have to hang out with those guys any more. Besides, you really need a facial. And I mean, I thought we could spend the day together. You know, after last night. DEACON But what about Matt and Fred? NAOMI Well what about me? She pouts. She has him under her thumb. He takes her hand and continues into the store. 86   INT.

About what? \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                87. \n87    INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - KITCHEN - NIGHT                               87 The family eats dinner in silence.

Deacon's Dad pushes away his plate and gets up. MR. LEWIS I have to go back to the office tonight. Johnson screwed the pooch again. MRS. LEWIS Whatever. 88    INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - GARAGE - NIGHT                                88 Deacon's Dad gets into the Aerostar. He turns on the radio, which blasts a ROCKING SONG.

(O.S.) ... they work hard for their money, guys, so let's tip them good. All right. Now, on the main carousel, let's give it up for the naughty school girl. ASHLEY! Applause. Ashley struts out through the cloud of stage FOG, right up to Deacon's Dad... ... who's turned around, ordering a drink. He turns back to see... ... Ashley's back, as she swings around the pole. She struts by each of the men in the front row, reaching down to take dollar bills out of their hands. She walks over to Deacon's Dad... ... but he's tipping the waitress. She does another spin around the pole... and lands in a split, face to face with... ... Deacon's Dad, who happens to have a crisp dollar bill between his teeth. They immediately recognize each other and FREEZE. A long beat. Then: MR. LEWIS Hello, naughty school girl whom I've never met before. ASHLEY You, too, are someone whose kitchen I've never been in. Another beat, then she grabs the bill out of his teeth, and quickly moves away. 91    INT. DEACON'S HOUSE - UPSTAIRS HALLWAY - NIGHT                     91 Dad walks upstairs, still a little stunned. MRS. LEWIS You get everything done at work? MR. LEWIS Yeah. All set. MRS. LEWIS Oh, guess who I ran into? Deacon's girlfriend, Ashley. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                     90. \nDad freezes. MR. LEWIS Where did you see Ashley? MRS. LEWIS Over on Industrial Way. MR. LEWIS You were on Industrial? MRS. LEWIS You know, she is so flexible. It's really amazing some of the positions that girl can twist herself into. MR. LEWIS What?!? MRS. LEWIS She even offered to teach me. So I could move like that. MR. LEWIS Yeah, that would be great! I mean, if you're into that. MRS. LEWIS Maybe. I like her. I know she's a little older, but I think she's good for Deacon. MR. LEWIS You do? Just then, Deacon walks past them down the hallway towards his bedroom. Dad eyes him with a rare combination of fatherly concern and male jealously. 92   INT. DEACON'S BEDROOM - NIGHT                                   92 Deacon walks past his desk and something catches his eye. He stops to look at a picture of himself with Fred and Matt from fifth grade. He looks really happy in the picture. Then, he sees a strip of photo booth pictures taken yesterday with Naomi. She's hamming it up for the camera, but you can tell from his expression, they don't belong together. He tosses the Naomi picture onto the desk. 93   EXT. DEACON'S HOUSE - BACK YARD - NIGHT                         93 Deacon stands by the water skipping rocks with Matt and Fred.

Matt calls \"Okay, people. Places. Let's get it together.\" Plantain puts the cigarette out on her heel, hides the tuna fish sandwich in her purse, and sprays the air with Weylon J. Petunia's. PLANTAIN My dress is ruined! BOUNCER I'm so sorry, Miss Jorgensen. What are we going to do? She rips off her dress in one big swoop, revealing sexy underwear. 95E   INT.

When he exits the bathroom, everyone is staring in his direction, then quickly looks away nonchalantly. 95F   INT.

One more time, same result. Suddenly Coop lets out a huge FART and everyone starts laughing. Matt throws his hands up, frustrated. 95H   INT.

I don't even know him. It's not like it was with us. It hits Deacon like a ton of bricks. 97   INT.

MATT Well, I cut together some footage to give to Ashley for her reel, but I don't think I can finish this film. FRED Why not? \nROGER Hey, guys. Great party. He wheels off.

COOP Hey, you're not on the list, dude. J.T. What's with you, you pussy? Are you joining the retard team, too? Just then, Plantain enters and walks to the front of the line. The high school guys stop everything to stare at her. PLANTAIN Coop! COOP Plantain. Plantain kisses him, while nonchalantly grabbing his crotch. PLANTAIN Come on. You don't need to wait in this line. Deacon and the guys are already inside. Coop puts his arms around her and walks away, not without looking back over his shoulder for a second at J.T. standing there, dumbfounded.

Have your boyfriends ever given you an orgasm? WENDY No. KELLY I think so. (off Ashley's look) No. ASHLEY Have you ever felt so completely satisfied in bed that you just wanted to sleep for a week? KELLY AND WENDY No. ASHLEY You're wasting your time giving those Neanderthals blowjobs. I mean, they'll probably wind up unemployed wife beaters anyway. KELLY So, are Deacon's friends seeing anybody? ASHLEY Matt and Fred? I don't think so. But if you're interested, you better move fast. Those guys know how to do this thing ... She whispers something to Wendy and Kelly. They look shocked.

ASHLEY You're gonna dump her. DEACON I don't want to. I don't know. It's not like it was when I was with Rachael. Rachael and I used to talk about stuff. We just, I don't know, connected. ASHLEY Very good, Deacon. Deacon is confused. DEACON What do you mean? ASHLEY Oh, nothing. I guess I'm just glad that you finally figured it out. A moment of realization. DEACON Yeah, I guess I did. (beat) So I have to do this, don't I? ASHLEY (joking this time) I guess. Or not. Whatever. Deacon smiles. He finally understands that Ashley really does care about him. Ashley kisses him on the cheek and exits off into the horizon. 101   EXT. AMUSEMENT PARK - NIGHT                                      101 Deacon holds Naomi's hand and they walk and talk.

Students stop to look up at them. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                        116. \n121A   ON THE MONITORS                                                     121A plays a specially edited version of the infamous first attempt at making the porno, aptly titled, \"William H. Wall High School Presents: The Premature E-Jake-ulator.\" JAKE I've got a tiny pee-pee? I'm a premature e-jac-u-la-tor? 121B   HALLWAY                                                             121B Jake is horrified. JAKE Stop it! Stop the video! MATT You probably shouldn't have mailed that tape back to us. The video starts repeating in continuous loop, but has been edited to sound like a rap song. JAKE (O.S.) Tiny pee-pee. Tiny pee-pee. E-jac-u-la- tor. E-jac, e-jac, e-jac-u-laaaaaaa-tor. Students point and laugh at him, while Deacon and the guys continue on down the hallway, dancing to the beat. Deacon kisses Rachael goodbye. DEACON You know, guys, I've been thinking about something. FRED What's that? DEACON About how making the movie didn't turn out to be so fun. I think I figured out why. They stop at their lockers. DEACON (CONT'D) Sex is like a comic book, still in the original wrapper. Once you open it up and read it, it loses its value. FRED Deep. \nFINAL SHOOTING SCRIPT                                       117. \nMATT I think he's got something there. Making that movie felt like we were tampering with forces we couldn't possibly understand. DEACON Exactly. The fun part about high school is unravelling the mystery of what's going to happen next. The guys smile and dial the combinations on their lockers. In the background, Jake is still on the ground crying. We TRACK through the hallway, outside... 121C   EXT. WILLIAM WALL HIGH SCHOOL - PARKING LOT - DAY                  121C ... where we see a large CAR TRANSPORT, with three hot new sports cars on it. Their license plates read \"JOHNNY H,\" \"SAM SLAM,\" and \"BALLS.\" TRACK OVER to Mike, unloading the cars and Vic, standing there smiling. FADE OUT: END CREDITS FADE IN: 122    INT. HOTEL ROOM - NIGHT                                             122 Deacon's parents are in bed. On the TV plays familiar sounding porno music on the hotel pay-per-view. MR. LEWIS Why do they always have to show the guy's face? MRS. LEWIS To make you think you can get girls as hot as her. It's a basic rule of porno. A long beat. MR. LEWIS Hey. Isn't that our basement?

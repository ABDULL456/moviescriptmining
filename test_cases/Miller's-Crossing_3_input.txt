Through the woods, pulling the two men, Bernie in the foreground.  Tree limbs groan in the wind. 
Bernie is stumbling, his clothes rumpled and dirty, his face stained by tears and blood from the gun blow.  His shaking voice strains for a tone of reasonableness: 
Bernie . . . Tommy, you can't do this.  You don't bump guys.  You're not like those animals back there. 
Tom marches on, face drawn, silent. 
. . . It's not right, Tom.  They can't make us do this.  It's a wrong situation.  They can't make us different people than we are.  We're not muscle, Tom.  I never killed anybody.  I used a little information for a chisel, that's all.  I couldn't help it, Tom, it's my nature.  Somebody hands me an angle, I play it.  I don't deserve to die for that!  D'you think I do?  I'm just a grifter!  Huh, Tom? 
Still no response from Tom.  Bernie is fighting a losing battle to keep himself from whining. 
. . . But I'll tell you what, I never crossed a friend.  Huh, Tom?  Never killed anybody, never crossed a friend.  Nor you, I'll bet.  We're not like those animals.  You can't do this!  You're not like those animals.  This is not us!  This is some hop dream! 
Tom's face is a ---ny mask.  Bernie is losing control again.  He starts to weep. 
. . . It's a dream!  Tommy!  I'm praying to you! I can't die!  I can't die!  Out here in the woods!  Like a dumb animal!  I can't die! 
He turns and sinks to his knees, wailing, his hands clasped in front of him, staring up at Tom. 
. . . You can't kill me.  I'm praying to you! look in your heart!  I'm praying to you!  Look in your heart! 
Tom stares down at Bernie, his face drawn and pale. 
. . . I'm praying to you!  Look in your heart! 
Slowly Tom raises the gun and levels it at Bernie's head. 
. . . Look in your heart!  Look in your-- 
BOOM!  The gun blast is deafening.  With it, Bernie's sobbing abruptly stops. 
The shot echoes away in the woods, taking the wind with it, leaving silence. 
CLOSE   BERNIE 
Still kneeling, in shock, staring wide-eyed at Tom. 
Finally, whispering: 
Bernie . . . Tommy. 
Tom Shutup.  You're dead, get me? 
Still whispering: 
Bernie I understand.  I'm dead.  God bless you-- 
Tom Shutup.  You have to disappear.  You have to blow, for good.  Nobody can see you, nobody can know. 
Bernie God bless you-- 
Tom Go somewhere no one knows you.  Anyone sees you, you really are dead, I don't care, you're not my problem any more. 
Bernie Of course not.  Of course not.  You've done your share.  Thank you.  Don't worry, I understand. Thank you-- 
Tom Shutup. Just get the hell out, before I change my mind. 
Bernie is already on his feet, and running. 
CLOSE ON TOM 
Watching Bernie go. 
TRACKING 
Pulling Bernie as he runs.  Foreground trees flash by.  In the background we see Tom standing, his gun dangling at his side. 
Boom!--another gun blast.  Running, Bernie reacts, but Tom has only fired into the ground. 
On the echo of the shot we cut to: 
41.  WIDE   THE ROAD 
Tic-Tac and Frankie are leaning against the car, trading the flask back and forth. 
In the background, Tom emerges from the woods. 
Frankie Put one in his brain? 
Tom takes a few steps more before answering: 
Tom . . . Yeah. 
Frankie Attaboy. 
FADE OUT 
Over black we hear the sound of coins being dropped into a phone box. 
42.  FADE IN 
Looking down a deserted street towards a glowing phone booth on a dark corner.  Tom stands inside the booth waiting, the receiver to his ear. 
Tom Mink?  Tom Duchaisne.  Where've you been?. . . 
CLOSE ON TOM 
Inside the phone booth. 
. . . Well you're lucky, Bluepoint's been looking for you.  Bernie's dead--Stop wailing and listen to me.  Caspar knows you were in on selling out his fix. . . I guess I gave him that idea.  Sorry Mink, we were chatting and it just slipped out.-- Shutup and let me talk.  You've gotta make yourself missing, but let me know where you hole up.  You're gonna say some things for me. . . Some stories.  About Bluepoint, to Caspar--don't worry, I'll let you know.  For now just dis- appear. . . Yeah, I got you into it.  Just remember, Mink, I'm the only one who can get you out. 
Tom hangs up the phone, turns around and opens up the glass door. 
WHOMMMP!  A fist slams into his stomach, driving him back into the phone booth, knocking his hat off of his head. 
The man who hit him leans down, picks up the hat, dusts it off and hands it into the booth.  It is Dead Terry, the tall cadaverous man we saw earlier outside of Leo's office. A cigarette dangles from his lower lip. 
Behind him a black sedan is parked at the curb.  Three or four gunmen stand on the sidewalk looking warily up and down the road. 
Tom looks up, the color drained from his face, and reaches feebly out for his hat. 
Tom 'Lo, Terry.  Getting out the vote? 
Dead Terry flicks his cigarette away and smiles.

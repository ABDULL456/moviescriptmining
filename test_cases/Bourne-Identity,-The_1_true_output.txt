BOURNE -- how? -- 
MARIE -- there's two of us -- we'll tell them -- we'll just -- 
BOURNE -- forget it -- 
MARIE -- we'll tell them what happened -- 
BOURNE I don't know what happened! (huge here) I don't know who he is! I don't know what he wants! I don't even know who I am! The only thing I know is that if I stay here, I'm never gonna find out! 
BOURNE -- that's it -- grabbing the backpack -- pulling it on -- just about to make his move -- 
She's standing there. Just utterly swamped. Lost. 
BOURNE Come with me. (she turns back, he's waiting --) I can get us out of here. I know it. Then we can think. Then we can work it out. We'll explain it then.  Once we're safe. (rock solid) I can protect you. 
EXT. THE PARIS APARTMENT BUILDING -- DAY 
A CROWD is gathered around CASTEL'S BODY. Rubberneckers and people pointing up to the broken window -- THE CONCIERGE running out to the street and getting the news and THE SOUND OF SIRENS bleeding in from the distance and -- 
THE CAMERA PULLS BACK TO FIND 
THE LITTLE RED CAR pulling out of the alley. Turning away from the scene. Disappearing into the streets of Paris -- 
INT. WOMBOSI COMPOUND MAIN HALLWAY -- DAY 
THRONE ROOM DOORS flying open -- WOMBOSI exploding out into the hallway -- 
WOMBOSI -- No! -- I say, no! -- they go this far -- out a body in the grave -- another body! -- no! -- this isn't over -- these people are not finished -- nothing will make them finish until they have Wombosi! -- the real Wombosi -- until I'm the one in the box! -- 
SIX KIDS -- TWO WIVES -- THREE BODYGUARDS -- all startled by this steamrolling mass of energy and paranoia -- 
WOMBOSI -- what are you doing? -- (bearing down on Bodyguard #2 --) -- sleeping? -- (to Deauvage --) -- he's sleeping! -- this man is sleeping at his post! -- (kicking the chair out from under him --) -- I've had men killed for this! -- (but he's still moving --) -- you think these people? -- these people who come for me -- you think they sleep? -- they never sleep! -- they spend all the day -- all the night -- all time thinking about how to put Wombosi in that box! -- (he's just gonna keep going, and we're into--) 
A MASSIVE ONE-TAKE TRACKING SHOT 
DEAUVAGE on his feet -- racing to follow -- KIDS scattering out of the way -- THE WIVES completely unfazed and -- 
WOMBOSI -- there is no box for Wombosi! -- they don't have a box that can hold me! -- I know these people -- I know they never sleep! -- I know they never stop! -- they never stop until the knife is at their throat! -- (suddenly distracted --) -- what is the window? -- this window is open! -- who leaves this open! -- (before Deauvage can possibly respond --) -- this is a war, you fool! -- you think these people are like you? -- you think this is stupid people? -- careless people? -- these people see an open window, they reach in with a big hand and grab your heart until you die! -- (still rolling as--) 
WE'RE HEADING DOWN TO THE POOL 
WOMBOSI -- and it won't just be me! -- they don't just want Wombosi now! -- they want my babies -- they want my children! -- and I say no! -- (grabbing Deauvage --) -- you leave that window open again, you better pray they kill me -- (something's caught his ear in the distance and now he's trying to get there --) -- everything changes here now! -- everyone is a soldier here now! -- this is a fortress now! Are we clear with this? 
DEAUVAGE Yes, sir. All clear. 
WOMBOSI stops to look at DEAUVAGE. In the background, we can hear A CHILD CRYING by the pool -- 
WOMBOSI This man is out there. Kane is out there. And they pretend he's dead. That means he's coming back. 
WOMBOSI moving quickly now and WE'RE STILL TRACKING -- taking him into -- 
THE POOL AREA 
FORTY KIDS going nuts in the water. ONE KID crying. WOMBOSI like a shot -- picking the kid up -- drying his tears -- making a funny face -- getting a smile as -- 
INT. GARE DU NORD -- DAY 
BOURNE and MARIE stash the red bag in a locker. 
INT. CIA PSYCHOACOUSTICS LAB -- DAY 
AN ELECTRONICS CONSOLE. Super-tech. Meters -- LEDs -- wave- form analyzers -- audio spectrum filters -- all of this gear dancing and responding to every nuance of -- 
BOURNE'S VOICE -- OVER SPEAKERS -- we're listening to a recording of the call he made from the apartment to the Hotel Marbeouf Paris -- 
BOURNE/TAPE "Okay. Merci." (pause) "Un moment -- un moment --" 
OPERATOR/TAPE "-- sir? --" 
BOURNE/TAPE "-- hang on -- I need you to check another name for me -- hang on -- un moment, s'il vous plait --" 
PULL BACK TO REVEAL
